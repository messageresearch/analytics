We we're going to have we're going to hear from a bunch of preachers tonight. And uh I love these kind of services and and so brother Kobe is is h going to start the service out this evening. And and um so we we want you to uh just pull on the gifts of God in all of these brothers lives. And um Amen. There is no telling what God is going to do here in our midst here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we get we get things in a certain pattern and we get accustomed to it. So, I like these kind of services because we it sort of mixes things up, gets you off uh what you're thinking. What are you doing up there leading songs? Amen. And uh and and uh it's been a long time since I've led songs. Amen. But uh uh we just thought we'd just just just totally break it up tonight. But as as brother Kobe comes to deliver the word of the Lord to us tonight, why don't we just sing it? Give myself away. Give myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. If that's your desire tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you have your Bibles, like to turn to a familiar passage of scripture, Psalms 150 and1. We um last time we spoke, we talked along these lines and we're just going to continue along that thought on praise if we can tonight. But Psalms 150 and verse 1-6. Amen. Do you love him here tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Says, "Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet. Praise him with the psalm tree and harp. Praise him with the timal and dance. Praise him with the string instruments and organ. Praise him upon the loud symbols. Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. Let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, you may be seated. Can we turn to one more passage of scripture, Psalms 22 and 22. And we're going to keep this this brief here tonight. And um let everyone else have my time. Amen. But I'm looking forward to it tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 22 and 22 says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren. In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. &gt;&gt; I was thinking on this topic what is praise and the definition for praise is to express approval or admiration of or to honor in words. Praise it can be a a honest heartfelt expression of of God's greatness and majesty. Amen. Psalms 22:3 says, "But thou art holy, oh thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel." Jesus says here that after this man, I pray ye our father which art in heaven. Hallowed, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth in this earth. Amen as it is in heaven. And give us this day our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine &gt;&gt; is the kingdom &gt;&gt; and the power &gt;&gt; and the glory forever. Amen and amen. So Jesus is showing us here that when when we begin to pray and when we end our prayer, give him thanks for what he's done for us. &gt;&gt; Give him praise for who he truly is. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love it here that praise I it's something that you may not feel like it in the moment. Praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; I love how praise IS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO PUSH PAST what you're dealing with at the moment. &gt;&gt; Praise is something that THAT THAT IS NOT LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE. IT'S NOT LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH IN THE MOMENT, BUT IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT SAYS, GOD, YOU DESERVE THE GLORY EVEN WHEN I DON'T FEEL LIKE GIVING IT. &gt;&gt; AND GOD, YOU DESERVE THE PRAISE EVEN WHEN I DON'T SEE MY HEALING OR I DON'T SEE THE ANSWER THAT I'M LOOKING FOR. I DON'T SEE MY CHILDREN COMING BACK TO GOD YET. AND YET, YOU BEGIN TO GIVE HIM PRAISE FOR WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T PRAISE GOD WHEN THINGS ARE JUST GOOD, BUT YOU PRAISE GOD WHEN THINGS ARE BAD AS WELL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE TRUE PRAISE COMES FROM. WE CAN PRAISE GOD WHEN MONEY IS IN THE ACCOUNT. AND WE CAN PRAISE GOD WHEN HEALING IS UPON OUR BODY. BUT WHAT ABOUT PRAISING GOD WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF A CIRCUMSTANCE OR A TRIAL? &gt;&gt; HEAR WHAT BROTHER JOHN'S BEEN DEALING WITH WITH HIS JOB. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE CAN PRAISE GOD BECAUSE GOD ALREADY HAS THE ANSWER FOR WHAT HE HAS NEED OF HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE COME AND PRAISE THE LORD BECAUSE WE PRAISE A GOD THAT HAS NEVER EVER EVER FAILED US YET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I love that song. IT SAYS, "LIFT YOUR HEAD. &gt;&gt; MORNING IS COMING. There's more to the story. Don't forget that in grief and in glory, STILL GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS. YES. &gt;&gt; STILL GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS. EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL HIS PRESENCE, STILL GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS. EVEN EVEN WHEN WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY THE ENEMY, YOU CAN PRAISE HIM AND SAY, "LORD, YOU MAY NEVER DO ANOTHER THING FOR ME AGAIN." BUT STILL GREAT, &gt;&gt; STILL GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS BECAUSE GOD IS FAITHFUL WHETHER WE ARE OR NOT, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS. YEAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE BASED OFF EMOTIONS, &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS NOT BASED OFF EMOTIONS. &gt;&gt; HE'S FAITHFUL WHEN WE'RE NOT. &gt;&gt; GOD IS ALWAYS THERE WHEN WE FORSAKE HIM. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NEVER LEFT US ALONE. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm I'm thankful for that here tonight. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DAVID SAYS HERE, "BUT I TRUST IN THY MERCY &gt;&gt; AND MY HEART SHALL REJOICE IN THY SALVATION. AND I WILL SING UNTO THE LORD BECAUSE HE HAS DEALT BOUNTIFULLY WITH ME. SO HE'S SAYING THAT IN IN SPITE OF THE TRIALS AND THE BURDENS AND AND DISAPPOINTMENTS IN LIFE, YOU STILL GOT TO PRAISE UPON YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST UPON YOUR LIPS, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE HEART. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER DAY AS WE SPOKE ON THIS THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN WHERE THE SONG HAS COME FROM, BUT YOU BEGIN TO PRAISE HIM ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS. OH MY. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT OF A LOSS IT MAY HAVE BEEN, THERE IS STILL SOMETHING THERE. IT'S NOT BASED UPON YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE DOESN'T REQUIRE THE ABSENCE OF TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. AS LONG AS WE'RE IN THIS FLESH, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLES &gt;&gt; AND TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS. BUT DO NOT DESPAIR. THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN TAKE YOU DOWN. YOU MAY BE SURROUNDED. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE SURROUNDED, BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN TAKE YOUR PRAISE HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN TAKE YOUR WORSHIP AND YOUR GRATITUDE TO THE GOD THAT LEFT EVERYTHING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. THAT GAVE EVERYTHING FOR YOU HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE HEART THAT THAT IT BEGINS TO BUBBLE OVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS THE STORY ABOUT THE BUBBLING BROOK and he he he goes to the brook AND ASKS THE BROOK AND WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO BUBBLY? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; IS IS IT BECAUSE THAT THE DEER DRINK FROM YOU? HE'S LIKE, "NO." &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE'S LIKE, "WELL, MAYBE IS IT BECAUSE THAT THIS ANIMAL DRINKS FROM YOU?" HE SAYS, "NO." HE SAID, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME? I DRINK FROM YOU." YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE'S LIKE, "NO, THAT'S THE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL." HE'S SAYING, "THERE'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S PUSHING FROM THE INWARD OUT. &gt;&gt; HE CAN'T CONTROL IT. HE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN THE HEART." AND THAT'S HOW WE ARE AS CHRISTIANS. WE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. &gt;&gt; We We IT'S A WE CAN'T GIVE AN EXPLANATION OF WHY WE PRAISE GOD WHEN WE DO. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING &gt;&gt; ON THE INSIDE THAT'S PUSHING PAST FEELINGS, PUSHING PAST EMOTIONS, PUSHING PAST HARDSHIPS, AND SAY, "I WILL GIVE GOD THE PRAISE HE DESERVES." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; As that song says, PRAISE OPENS PRISON DOORS. &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN SEE THAT WITH PAUL AND SILAS. HOW THEY WERE IN THE MIDNIGHT HOUR. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BE DISCOURAGED. COME ON NOW. THEY'RE THEY WERE IN CHAINS AND FEATHERS IN A DARK DUNGEON. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BE DISCOURAGED. THEY THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO FEEL FORSAKEN AND ALL ALONE. BUT THESE GROUP OF MEN KNEW THAT IF THEY COULD PRAISE GOD, THEY COULD PRAISE THEIR WAY OUT OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD. AND IF I CAN SAY THIS, BROTHER MERL, THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL JAIL HOUSE ROCK RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ELVIS HAD NOTHING ON THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD. AND WHAT HAPPENED? THE WALLS BEGIN TO SHAKE. &gt;&gt; THE FEATHERS THAT HELD THEM BEGIN TO FALL DOWN AND HIT THE GROUND. WHY? BECAUSE PRAISE. PRAISE. GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO PRAISE THEM NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH. &gt;&gt; GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE HERE TONIGHT THAT IS GOING TO PUSH PAST UNBELIEF, PUSH PAST THE STRUGGLE, AND SAY, "GOD, I PRAISE YOU." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOUR FAITH IS IN GOD, YOU CAN PRAISE HIM. YOU CAN SING A SONG OF PRAISE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DAVID SAID HERE, I LOVE THIS SCRIPTURE AS I'M ALMOST DONE. HE SAYS, "CAST ME NOT AWAY FROM THY PRESENCE, OH LORD, AND TAKE NOT THY HOLY SPIRIT FROM ME, BUT RESTORE." THAT'S MY PRAYERS, LORD. RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY &gt;&gt; OF THY SALVATION. NOT MY SALVATION, BUT YOURS, LORD. AND UPHOLD ME WITH A FREE SPIRIT. WE GET TIRED OF DEALING WITH LIFE. WE GET WEARY &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH IT ALL A A SONG MAY COME UPON YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; AND I LOVE THAT SONG, GRATITUDE, BECAUSE THAT MAY BE THE ONLY THING THAT YOU COULD GET OUT OF YOUR MOUTH AT THAT TIME IS LORD, I THROW IN MY HANDS &gt;&gt; AND I PRAISE YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW, THAT MAY BE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO. MAYBE THE ONLY THING YOU GOT AND YOUR STRUGGLE IS A HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO I THROW IN MY HANDS. &gt;&gt; There you go, PREACHER. &gt;&gt; I PRAISE YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. That may be it. &gt;&gt; I know it's not much, Lord. I have nothing else fit for a king except a song of praise. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if I can LEAVE THIS WITH YOU TONIGHT, YOU MAY BE IN THAT SPOT RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; AND YOU MAY FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING IS AGAINST YOU RIGHT NOW. YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOUR BILLS ARE PILING UP OR YOU MAY FEEL LIKE THE DOCTOR'S REPORT IS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. IT JUST LEFT YOU DEPRESSED OR DEAL GRANDPA DEALING WITH PARKINSON'S. I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM DEALING WITH THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT ALL I KNOW IS ON THE HEART OF THESE BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. There's a song &gt;&gt; I just throw in my hands. &gt;&gt; I praise you again and again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's been my cries. Lord, don't let me look at the situation. &gt;&gt; But Lord, let me &gt;&gt; let me push. It's a struggle to push through. &gt;&gt; It's a struggle TO PUSH THROUGH. BUT I PROMISE YOU, ONCE YOU CAN PUSH past that, &gt;&gt; all right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL MEET YOU RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He has THE ANSWER FOR YOU ALREADY. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME THAT WE LET GO AND PRAISE the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you here tonight. &gt;&gt; It's already done. Hallelujah. It's already done. Praise his name. The battle is over. The victory is won. It's already done. Let's sing it as brother Harry comes. It's already done. Hallelu. It's already done. Praise his name. The battle is over. The victory is won. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter 5. Matthew chapter 5 and starting at verse 23. Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first to be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. And let's go ahead and turn to Matthew chapter 18. Matthew chapter 18 and starting at verse 21. Then came Peter to him and said,"Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him till seven times?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee until seven times, but until 70* 7. You know, I was trying to think about what to to preach on, what to to minister on this evening. And, you know, it's something that being humans, we constantly have to deal with people with different personalities than us. Um, and this is even in This is even in the church doors. We're not all clones. We're not all thinking the same thing. We don't all have the same opinions. We all uh have different thoughts on things. We all have different ways of of of handling situations, different ways of of doing things. I mean, you're even going to see tonight there the different styles of ministry that you have between the different brothers and the ways that they uh approach and the way that God has used the gift that's in their lives. And &gt;&gt; it's it's one of those things where as we spend time around our our brothers and sisters and we begin to get that feeling of of commonness, &gt;&gt; we begin to notice more of the things that that bother us, more of the things that that irritate us, more of the things that can make us come into church. and we begin to lose our blessing because we have an issue with somebody. &gt;&gt; And now we know that, you know, I was as I was thinking about this, I was thinking about as brother Wendell had talked about all the different events we have coming up this month and different things. And one of the things that we have coming up is our New Year's Eve service. And &gt;&gt; you know, normally for New Year's Eve service, we have communion. And brother Brandon would talk about communion and you know he said in the sermon let your light so shine before men. He says now I thought maybe tonight is communion night and I hear they've had a baptism and going to have another and I like to come down for for communion. I missed it the last time not being here. I missed it and I knew this was the first Sunday. So I made preparation to be here so I could be in communion for tonight. For I truly think it's the duty of every every Christian to take communion. The Bible said, 'If you take this not, you have no part with me. And I believe that this is a showdown time for the Christians. If we do not take it, we have no part with him. And if we take it unworthy, then we're guilty of the body and death of Christ. So it gets to a place where it keeps the Christian prayed up when he comes to communion. We should come reverently, solemnly, sacredly, walking up, confessing all of our wrongs, praying one for another. Not only that, but we should feel if there's a brother or sister among us that we feel is just a little bit out of line somewhere, our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night, especially to see them, that they'll be able to walk up and take communion, not to be condemned with the world because they are our brothers and and our sisters. And you know when you look at the scripture that we read in in Matthew chapter 5 and verse 23, therefore if they thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee. This is not saying if you remember that you have a problem &gt;&gt; with your brother. This is not saying if you come up to worship and realize, oh, I've got bad feelings towards somebody. There's there's someone that I have issues with. that gets dealt with throughout the scriptures. If you deal with the sin in your own life, deal with the beam in your own eye, deal with the all of these different things. But in this scripture he Jesus is telling us if you are coming up to bring your gift to the altar, if you are coming up to offer sacrifice, if you are coming up to worship, if you are coming up to communion, if you are coming up in this time and you remember and you think about the fact that there is a brother or sister that they have a problem with you, &gt;&gt; your conscience is clear. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're sitting there. You have no problems. You've confessed. You're clear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Leave your gift at the altar." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Don't offer it. &gt;&gt; Walk away and go be brought back together with your brother. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This isn't about just going in and going, "Okay, is my heart clean? Am I have I been washed in the blood? Have I confessed everything? Am I clean?" But it's now going into it with the mindset of is my brother and my sister right? Do they have something against me that I can deal with that I can come in and I can have the conversation with them and I can, you know, take the take the blame if that's what's necessary. I can do whatever. I can talk to them. I can confess. I can apologize that their feelings were hurt because of something I said or something I did. I can I can do whatever brother Brandham says in the sermon and thou son of David have mercy on me. He said if I too knew tonight that I had an enemy. I may have I perhaps have but if I do I don't just know who it is. If it was I sure wouldn't go to preaching till I went first and made that right. See if I could get it straightened up because we're not supposed to have anything against anyone. Or if anything we can do, let no one have anything against us. See, now if we don't say if you have ought against a brother, but it says if the brother has ought against thee, see you go to him. If he has ought, that's the way that's why we live a peaceful life. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Wendell made the comment during his sermon this morning. He said, "God cannot bless us until we have fully obeyed." &gt;&gt; All right. It's true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we can go into all kinds of areas in our lives to go, okay, have we really fully obeyed? But this is just one that I was thinking about as we were thinking about praise and worship and thinking about communion upcoming and and these different things as we're in this season when we're thinking about the fact that God sent his sacrifice &gt;&gt; to earth to grow up, to minister, to die for us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and as we're going through this that we are supposed to be willing to step out not because I'm offended &gt;&gt; not because there's something in my life that I need down to go to brother KBY and I need to confess that I did something wrong that there's guilt in my heart that &gt;&gt; that I'm trying to make it right but it's now me going to brother KBY because I'm concerned about his salvation because I'm concerned concerned about is he going to be able to come come up to communion? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Is brother Caleb is is everything right between us? &gt;&gt; Do I know that he has something against me? Well, then I want to take care of it whether I caused it or not, &gt;&gt; whether it's just something that's in his head and I had nothing to do with it. whatever it might be, because I'm caring and loving my brother. &gt;&gt; Because I'm more interested in making sure that my brother and sister are right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we're there here together. Yes, we have to make sure of our own salvation. Yes, we have to make sure of everything going on in our lives. Confess it. Deal with it. If there's a besitting sin, deal with it in your life. In no way am I saying we're going to completely ignore our own lives. &gt;&gt; But the scriptures take us beyond that. If I'm at the point where I am clear and I can come up to this communion table and I can take it without any type of reservation, without any type of thought in my heart that maybe I'm not right. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Well, then I should be thinking next about, okay, are my brothers and sisters where they should be? Is there anything that I could do to help clear them up for this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, we were in a church previously before we moved to Oklahoma. There was one that that my wife and I were in that on communion services, they would actually say, "We're taking 5 minutes, 10 minutes, whatever, you pray. If there is something that you need to deal with, &gt;&gt; deal with it." If that means you step outside the church and you get on your phone and you call somebody, you get it done. &gt;&gt; And they would have the music playing quietly. They would have whatever. And it was just This is serious. And that's not necessarily the right thing for every single church. I'm not trying to convince Brother Wendle to do anything here, but it was something that made an impression in me to think about, okay, is everything right? &gt;&gt; And is there anything that I can do to help my brother or sister? Is there something where I'm going, okay, they've been treating me a little differently? They've been they've been acting towards me a little bit differently. I don't know what I did. &gt;&gt; I didn't do anything intentional. So, I don't feel like there's anything that I feel guilty about. There's nothing that I am sitting here going, "Man, I really need to confess this." &gt;&gt; But I still want to go and talk to that brother or talk to that sister because I want to make sure there's nothing coming in between me and them. I want to make sure there's nothing coming in between me and my savior or they and their savior. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Romans 12 and verse 18 says, "If it be possible as much as lith in you, live peacefully, live peaceibly with all men." And brother Brandham, as he was talking in that quote I just read, he said, "You go to him if he has ought." That's why we live peaceful. &gt;&gt; It's so easy within the church body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For us to almost lose sight of the fact that, oh, we're just we're all Christians. We're all part of the body of Christ. And we begin focusing on those differences in personality and those differences in communication, those differences in parenting styles, those differences in uh worship styles, those differences in communication style, and letting that needle us, letting that bother us, letting that build up a barrier. &gt;&gt; Whether it's something that we're going, "Oh, that's all on me." Or whether it's going I need to clear up something to make sure that the channel between me and Brother Wendell are okay. Brother Wendell and I are not clones of each other. We do not think the same way. We do not respond the same way to things. We do not act the same way. And so, I'm sure there are things that I do that bother him in some level. I'm sure there are things that he does that bother me in some level. But God has called both of us and given us both gifts in our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's my brother in Christ. He's my pastor. And so there's a love that goes there to go, &gt;&gt; I want to make sure &gt;&gt; that I'm right, that he's right, and that we're able to enter into that worship, that we're able to enter into that communion. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the sermon, he carth for you. Brother Brandham says, "Don't you care enough to submit your life to him, to love him, to go to the streets, to go to your boss, to your neighbor, to everywhere with a sweet, gentle spirit? Separate yourselves from the things of the world and live such a peaceable, sweet life that others will see Jesus in you. Don't you feel that you owe that to him?" There are times when we remember that while we're outside this when we're outside this building, when we're outside this fellowship, when we're on the job site, we'll remember, okay, I've got to be a witness. Okay, I'm I'm living a life. I'm I'm I'm trying to to be an example. I'm trying to express Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then we'll get here in the midst with our brothers and our sisters and we'll allow ourselves to maybe speak a little more sharply than we should have or maybe allow something to to poke us or bother us more than we would. I mean, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe I'm the only one, but when I'm out working in the world, I expect them to do stuff that are going to irritate me. &gt;&gt; And you brush it to the side and go, "Okay, And in your mind, you're just going, "They're not Christians. They don't know any better." &gt;&gt; And then we come into the body of Christ where God has placed all these different parts, all these different people, all these different personalities, all these diff different types. and we give them less leeway &gt;&gt; than what we're willing to give to the strangers that are out there. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; When this is the family of God, this is the one that we should be caring for the most. &gt;&gt; This is the one that we should be in some ways holding ourselves to an even higher standard. I should be reflecting Christ here more and easier than I can out there. &gt;&gt; This isn't the place I get to let down and go, "Oh, great. I can act however because we're all Christians. &gt;&gt; They understand. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I can be irritating. I can do this. I can do that. &gt;&gt; But yet, we're called to love our brothers and sisters. We're called to to love the body of Christ. And like I said at the beginning, we're called to love so much that before we offer our sacrifice at the altar, before we offer our gift at the altar, before we enter into that worship, &gt;&gt; that we're willing to go make it right for them. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Because we weren't in condemnation as we stood there to worship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But as we were standing there, we realized, "Oh, wait. I think Luke has a problem with me. I think I need to go deal with that. I think I He's been acting a little different lately. I I need to go talk to my son for a little bit &gt;&gt; and make sure that he's good. &gt;&gt; And make sure that he's going to be okay. You know, as we're looking at, we've got a few weeks before our New Year's Eve service and communion. We've got some time before this. Not only should we be examining our own lives, as brother Brandham said, this is a showdown. We want to make sure that everything in our own lives are dealt with. We want to make sure that there's nothing that stands between me and my Lord. But then also, scriptures tell us, "Look for your brothers and sisters." Is there something that I can tell this person hasn't been speaking to me quite the same way they used to? They they haven't been connecting quite the same way. They they seem to be maybe I'm getting a little bit more of a cold shoulder. Maybe I'm getting a little more of this that. &gt;&gt; Okay. And God calls us and charges us to go to them and make it right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's always amazing as we go through the scripture and see how high the standard is. The standard isn't just confess and make yourself right. &gt;&gt; The standard is love your brother and sister to the point that you want to go clear up anything that would help to make sure that they're right. &gt;&gt; This isn't me going to them and going, "Brother Michael, you messed up here. you need to confess. &gt;&gt; That's not what we're doing. We're not making the situation worse. This is me going to brother Michael and brother Michael, I don't know exactly what I did, but I feel like I may have said something or done something that that has driven a little bit of a wedge between us and I just want to clear it up. And I am sorry if I've hurt you in some way. I've I'm sorry if I said something or did something &gt;&gt; and I just want to make sure that that we're good and that we can worship together because we're called to be a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord bless y'all. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Fill my way every day with love as I walk with the heavenly. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. One more time. Fill my way every day with love. As I walk with the heavenly dove, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. You know, I thought that was as as our brother was was mentioning that you know there in in Mark 11 and 22 where Jesus that those are very famous scriptures where Jesus said have faith in God and you know and and the faith of God. If you speak to this mountain uh be moved and cast into the sea and doubt not in your heart. I mean that that is a third pull uh scripture. That's something that that brother Brandham loved to use. But I but it was connected. And I've always thought that as interesting because then you know he deals with that in the Mark 11:22 23 24 and then he goes to 25 and he says and when you stand praying um forgive and if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespass. But if you forgive not neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespass. So, so it's it's interesting and how that that third pull scripture and we we talk about that that third pull. Amen. But Jesus is saying this is connected with forgiveness and how we we don't want to have those as against one another. And I think I think it's very very true because a lot of us we don't we we we feel something and we don't want to we don't want to cause a commotion or we don't want to cause something in someone else. But sometimes it's just best to go and say, "Hey, what what's if there's something between us, let's get that thing right?" Because you know what it's going to do? It's going to continue to cause a wedge deeper and deeper. And that's what Satan wants is to bring a wedge between us. And it's not your brother and it's not yourself that wants a wedge. It is Satan that brings these things in. And if we would handle it the way that brother uh uh Harry brought it here today, I I believe that we would all be a lot better off. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, as we get ready for brother Miguel to come, why don't we sing that? Bind us together, Lord. bind us together with cords that cannot be broken. Oh yes. B us together Lord. B us. God bless you &gt;&gt; together Lord. bind us together in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this evening? &gt;&gt; To be bound closer with the Lord is your desireful. I'm a little nervous. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm sweating, but it's not because I'm wearing this. actually, &gt;&gt; you know, kind of come part of it, you know, but if we could, you know, I'd like to go ahead and go to scripture. &gt;&gt; So, like I said, I'm a little nervous, but I'd like to go into a passage of scripture here. There uh 1st Samuel the 21st. Uh yeah, 1st Samuel 21, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And first verse. Let's see. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, I didn't write the verse down, but he goes on to the scripture. He talks about the sword of the Philistine. Um, pop it up there. You don't mind. I um, you know, Brother Windle had had asked us to speak something uh say something and you know I had some thoughts there on I had some thoughts there on my mind and uh and you know I don't know how to spell I can't spell that again so word searches don't do nothing for me you know so you know so I spelled sparrow s p r r o w for for a long time trying to find it you know and so but there in um there in 1 Samuel uh let me find it Let's see here. You guys just have to forgive me. Wrote it down here. And uh Samuel 21. Is that what it is? 21 verse 9. Uh starting there at the ninth verse. There it is. Yeah, forgive me. Didn't write it down. And it says, "And the priest said, the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of a law. Behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephog. If thou wil take it, thou will take that take it for there is no other save that here." And David said, "There is none like that. Give it to me." And and David arose and fled the day for fear of Saul. And he had went to Akesh, the king of Gath. And may the Lord just add the blessing to the reading of his word. But I was actually thinking about this passage of scripture uh there in 1 Samuel talking about the the sword of Goliath there and you know their remembrance or memory. It's ironic I'm talking about that, you know, but memory could be very key in our walk with the Lord. It uh when I say key, it uh just memory itself unlocks quite a bit of things. Uh you know, you need memory for you keypads to your to your buildings to get in. You need memory for scripture verses. You know, you need memory for spelling. You need memory for just all kinds of things, you And there's a lot of lot of us that our memory, I'm sure, is a little 50/50, you know, but it takes memory to be able to kind of keep the wheels rolling and be able to keep things kind of moving. And and in memory, you know, there's a lot of things that we retain in life, you know, there's a lot of things that uh anybody that's in the trades or anybody that's in something uh where it requires uh say if you're uh you know, if you're electrician, there's certain equations that you have to remember. If you're a plumber, there's certain sizes of pipe that you have to remember. air conditioning, you know, there's there's there's uh all kinds of, you know, sheet metal measurements and just all these kinds of things. But memory memory serves uh a purpose, but it's also a two-edged sword. And if we're not careful, we can let memory go lean toward the worst rather than to lean toward the good. And and if we're not careful, we'll begin to let the devil use memory as a sword against us because there's a lot of things uh uh you know, every one of us weren't weren't weren't just uh uh just peaches when when we were born. You know, there was a lot of things that we had gone through in life to be able to develop the character that we have today. And there's a lot of trials that we had to go through. There's a lot of things that we didn't understand, Lord. maybe as a young man or as a young woman or as an older man or an elderly sister that's been, you know, going through things in your life and there's certain things that you go through that now that you look back and you're saying, "Oh Lord, I understand why I went through these things and the Lord brings those things to your remembrance that that way you can understand God and be faithful in what he's doing." And and you know now thinking about this now just trying to take this and just attach it there to David's life but David was going through something in his life you know there was situation where he you know he was anointed king you know uh uh he was he was uh uh you know he'd been brought before the people god had delivered him from a lion god had delivered him from a bear but yet those those situations that he had done in his life wasn't wasn't for the present but it was for something that he was going to be going through in the future and there therefore we know the story about where David, you know, uh Goliath comes up on the scene, you know, and Goliath's there standing and he's boasting in front of the camp of Israel and he's like, you know, we know the story about, you know, he defies the army of God and that he's, you know, he he asked that he brings out a champion and that that he do all these certain things and the men that stood there for days after days after days and and couldn't recall the remembrance of what God had done year after year after year. But for the children of Israel, you know, he he delivered them from from countless tribes. He delivered them from famine. He delivered him he delivered them from the time coming from Egypt. He had delivered all these things. And now you got one man standing in front of an army. And and yet you have David, you know, David, he comes out and and he stands before Goliath and he and he just wipes or he not wipes, but he comes out with w with with a with a sling and a and a couple of rocks and he comes out there and he and he stands against a giant, a well-trained giant and he he just kills this giant and he puts him down. You know, we just think that at that point that David's going to be living there on on the on the mountaintop as king. But yet we find out that Dave is running for his life. And we find out that we find out that Saul becomes possessed. We we find out that that God all of a sudden he begins to he begins to take this joyous moment where he's been anointed king and and and all the berries and all the bells and whistles have been added to him and he begins to squeeze on David. And because in doing this, David's not quite sure what's going on, but he trusts in the Lord. And we begin to find him here at this moment of where of where David he's running for his life. And not only is he is he he's talking with the priest. And if I remember correctly in the story, the priest really is not supposed to be talking to David because David's running for his life. And and Saul's like, "Anybody that talks to him, anybody gives him shelter, anybody that gives him food, anybody that anybody that does anything that helps David, they're going to have to answer to me." and and and and and this priest now now he's looking at David and he and he could see that David's in in a situation, but yet and so David's like, "Hey, do you have any anything that I could use? Anything under your hand? Do you do you have any weapons?" And and and David at that point, he's looking for anything. And and the the the the priest begins to come out and he and he walks back and he says, "I've got something that might be of interest." and not his exact words, but you know, he I got something that might be of interest to you. And all of a sudden, he tells him about the sword of Goliath and and he tells him that that all I've got is this one sword that you know, do you remember? You know, and I could see the wheels begin to spin in the back of David's in the back of David's mind. And no doubt, like I said, at that moment that he was running for his life. At that moment, he was hungry because the scripture says that he he's asking for the bread that's underneath his hand. And he's like, you know, I can't give you this bread, you know, because it's basically it was a sanctified food. And he had asked him different things about it before he gave it to him, you know, and and he's beginning to think about, you know, all these things. But yet when he pulls that sword out and remembrance begins to come to his mind and and he begins to think about the time no doubt and these are just my words but begins to think about the time of of of how that he was anointed king and how God how God spared him and uh many of times before and about how God had how God had done many of works in his life and and now he was going through now he was now he was going through the trial of his life but yet he could hold that sword in his and and he could remember God's promises and he could remember the faithfulness of God. You know, and I begin to think about HOW THAT THERE'S A LOT of things a lot of a lot of us, we sit here and we go through things in our lives and in the midst of the in the midst of the chaos and in the midst of the trial that we're going through, we're asking the question why and why this and why that and Satan likes to bring up a lot of things. Well, it's because you did this and oh, you remember you did that and you swed this seed and oh, you swed that seed. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO JUST BE ABLE TO GET THERE AND hold the sword of God and you got to be able to stand there and say, "Yes, I did that, but I put it under the blood." AND AND GOD, YES, HE'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THE accuser of the brethren, he's he's sitting THERE AND HE'S PUTTING ALL MY SINS ON ME AT MY nighttime hour. I stand there and I GO BEFORE GOD AND I TRY TO PRAY AND HE PUTS this in front of me AND HE PUTS THAT IN FRONT OF ME. YOU JUST REMEMBER THE TIME AND LET GOD BE ABLE TO PUT IN THE TIME OF A remembrance of all the victories that you shared with the Lord and at the TIME WHEN GOD HAD BROUGHT YOU OUT OF YOUR OF YOUR DISTRESS ABOUT HOW GOD HAD BROUGHT YOU YOUR FAMILY when you thought that it WAS IMPOSSIBLE ABOUT HOW THAT THE TIME THAT GOD PUT GAS IN YOUR TANK WHEN IT WASN'T ABLE WHEN GOD PRO PROVIDED TO PAY THE BILLS that you're not standing here because of any merit that you MIGHT HAVE THAT OH I'M SO GOOD GOD HAS TO ACCEPT ME. YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AS IT FILTHY rags is before God. BUT IT'S THE FACT THAT GOD ELECTED YOU. GOD CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. THAT YOU MIGHT MANIFEST AND DISPLAY HIS ATTRIBUTES. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TO REMEMBER. You're not to remember the former things that you was. I'm not to remember the wretched man that I thought I was. I thought I was some great individual thinking that I oh, you know, everybody needs to respect me, needs to know who I AM. BUT GOD WANTS YOU TO REMEMBER, AMEN, THAT I AM THE ONE THAT BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND I AM THE ONE, AMEN, THAT'S GOING TO KEEP YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. JUST REMEMBER WHAT I'VE DONE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; You know, thinking about this, &gt;&gt; Amen. thinking about this and I'm wrapping it up here, but the children of the children of Israel had come and they had come to a place over the at the River Jordan. Now, they come to this place here and Jordan was all swelled up and the river was wide. &gt;&gt; It's interesting that God would bring them there in the middle of the flood. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But yet, God was the one that created the seasons. God was the one that was that causes everything to flow. Causes everything to come back. But he brought them to a river Jordan &gt;&gt; flow just overflowing. Oh, muddy old Jordan. Amen. But he come up to the banks and he said, "You know what? I I need you to take the music and put it first." &gt;&gt; As our brother Kobe was talking about praise, he wants you to take the music. I want you to take the ark and I want you to put them first. And what happened? the waters separated &gt;&gt; AND AFTER PRAISE HAD WENT through &gt;&gt; after THE WORD OF GOD HAD WENT THROUGH FIRST AND THE PEOPLE HAD COME ACROSS HE SAID NOW I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING IN remembrance he says I WANT YOU TO EVERYONE A TRIBE OF YOUR A STONE FROM EVERY ONE OF YOUR TRIBES AND I WANT YOU TO SET IT RIGHT HERE SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN AND ALL THOSE THAT ARE AFTER AFTER THAT WILL REMEMBER THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THAT I PROVIDED FOR YOU. I PROVIDED FOR YOUR NEEDS. I WAS THE ONE THAT BROUGHT YOU THROUGH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Not by your intellect or any ability that we have, but by God's grace and by his word, we're brought through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As our brother gets ready to come, God bless you here this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep God in your remembrance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. Give him gloryy all ye people for his blood has washed away sin stain. One more time. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. Give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each day. That was powerful tonight. Taking that sword of Goliath that was a memorial. That's the reason why they kept it there in in the tabernacle in the first place. That was a trophy of God's divine grace. &gt;&gt; And to think the very one who had cut his head off with that sword is the very one that was taking it in the in his time of need. Brother, that's powerful. That that was powerful tonight. He could have t I don't think he took up his full 15 20 minutes. Amen. And uh but that was good. Brother John, come on up. Let's sing that again. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sin slain. God bless you, brother John. Amen. Give him glory. &gt;&gt; For his blood each day. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to talk about nervous? That was good. that I've enjoyed tonight so far. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh I do have a couple scriptures here. Uh let's start with uh John 11 and 40. This is where Jesus came up to I guess after the funeral of Lazarus and he he came up there. But he said, Jesus said unto her, said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, &gt;&gt; thou shouldest see the glory of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like that. And then if we go over to Psalms, I think it is Psalms 46 and 10, he said, "Be still and know, believe, know, &gt;&gt; be still and know that I am God, &gt;&gt; and I will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in the earth." Amen. May God add a blessing to his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. But but I like this because we know as the preachings that have been coming from the the the sermons lately and and even when you listen to other ones online and and brother Windle's been preaching, we're in a fight. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says in Deuteronomy when he was talking to him there, he said, "When you go to battle," he didn't say if or nothing. He said, "When &gt;&gt; when you go to battle and you show up in this battle, there's going to be more of them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a lot more of them than there are of you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're going to be all around. And when you see this, don't worry. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How can you not be afraid when you're facing thousands upon thousands upon thousands more than what you are. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; How can you have the peace to praise God in the middle of this when everything is coming at you left and right and you look at this great multitude because God said so. &gt;&gt; Right. All right. All right. He said, "When you look at them, don't be afraid." And he said, "When." So, this isn't new. It's not new for me. It's not new for you. It's not new for your kids. It's not new for anybody that's a Christian. The battle's coming. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And if you're not in one coming out of one, you're going into one. &gt;&gt; The battle is coming, &gt;&gt; but the battle ain't yours. &gt;&gt; Okay? Lord, &gt;&gt; because he went on down in those same scriptures and he says, "Don't worry. This is my fight. This is my battle. I'm going to go. I will protect you. I will hold you. I will do this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he turned around and said, "And then when you come up and you lay siege to the city and it's been a long time." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's been a long time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "Don't cut down the trees &gt;&gt; because they're there for you to eat off of until." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. See, now I like until because until means there's a will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; The walls will fall. &gt;&gt; So, as we're standing in this battle and this fight's going and we're praising God, we're not lying. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You understand? We're We're not lying. People look at us and they're like, "They're crazy." Do you know what just happened to that guy? &gt;&gt; And yet he's singing and praising like nothing's wrong. &gt;&gt; But why not? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Until the walls fall. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We can praise God, brother. &gt;&gt; Until they will. It's a promise. It's given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And but then in that scripture where it says the cutting of the trees in Deuteronomy, it says don't cut down the trees. You can use them to eat. &gt;&gt; Now, cut down the bad trees, but don't you cut down those good trees. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. But how do you know it's a good tree? &gt;&gt; Even an apple tree in the winter time looks dead. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You may be at the worst time of your life. It may look like you're on your last leg. It's over. And before you say anything, age doesn't matter because I'm going to tell you right now, when it comes to God, math don't matter. &gt;&gt; You can go to school your entire life and you read the Bible and you'll understand that math is not true. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; It's not. You take 300 people up against thousands and thousands, there is no way &gt;&gt; they're going to win. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they do, &gt;&gt; right? Yes. &gt;&gt; You take David against Goliath, 5 foot nothing to 9 foot something. There's no way. &gt;&gt; He's going to win. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But he did. &gt;&gt; Because it never was his fight. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible said to be still, &gt;&gt; be still and know that I'm God. Now, being still in this particular thing doesn't mean you're not stepping with God. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Right? You're still moving with God. You're still praising God. You're still loving God. You're still asking for forgiveness when you make mistakes cuz you're going to make mistakes. &gt;&gt; You fall down, you're going to get up that &gt;&gt; you're still moving. So be still. Be still of what? Cut down the bad trees. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The thoughts that come at your head, the things that come at your heart. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Okay. &gt;&gt; All the negative stuff, cast it out. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Get rid of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. For God speaks the truth and all man's word is lies. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what the doctor says. Doesn't matter what anybody else says. It doesn't even matter what somebody says when they come up to you and said, "Well, I asked my doctor about you." Shut it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need to hear that because faith comes by hearing the word. So make sure you're hearing the right word &gt;&gt; because faith is going to come from what you listen to. So if you listen to the bad, you're going to believe the bad. &gt;&gt; But if you listen to God, be still. Let it go. God said &gt;&gt; God said, &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; God said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; You can praise him. You can love him. Arrows are flying. Everything's coming at you. But it don't matter &gt;&gt; because greater that's in you than in the world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Greater or we could say more. You see, when you step out into that battle, brothers and sisters, and you're looking at Satan and he's got every demon in hell aiming straight at you, &gt;&gt; if you're a Christian, &gt;&gt; because if he doesn't have them aimed at you, you're doing something wrong. &gt;&gt; Because if he's not worried about you, you have a problem. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, when things are going bad, don't be quite so upset because it may maybe just a little bit mean you're doing something right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Because the math don't matter. Right? Come on. &gt;&gt; But the biggest thing if if if I can leave anything with you guys tonight &gt;&gt; when you step out the door of your house and you've put on your armor and you know part of that armor is putting on the shoes for the preparation or something of like that to go preach the gospel of peace. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; you're putting on an armor to go into battle, but you're putting on shoes to go tell everybody it's peace time. Remember that as part of your armor, &gt;&gt; but when you're facing him and you walk out there and Satan's looking at you and calm your mind &gt;&gt; because the mistake was Satan's &gt;&gt; All right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. the mistake of coming against you and giving you a disease or telling you you have this or telling you you've done wrong or telling you you've done bad was Satan's mistake. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Because God protects his word and you are the manifestation of his word. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will have a people in this generation that loves me. I will have a people in this generation that follows my word. I will have you are the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And God will protect that word. So when Satan has come against you, what did the prophet tell God? Open his eyes so that he can see. And he turned around and looked and as far as he could see, there was chariots of fire, cherubs, angels all around surrounding the whole entire army. Satan's mistake was coming against you because he brought every demon in hell into the middle of the camp of God. He brought every demon in hell into the middle of the one that has already whooped him &gt;&gt; before this whole thing started. He cannot touch you. He cannot have you. All you have to do is be still here and believe God and you'll see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Because brothers and sisters, we are the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We're standing on the word, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and the word was with God and the word was God. So even if you're just standing on the word, you're standing on the shoulders of Christ. &gt;&gt; All right. Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It ain't even you walking. It's him. &gt;&gt; So, we want to praise him. &gt;&gt; And we do. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man that God doesn't impute sin to. Brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; blessed is the man. So, when you get up in the morning, I want you to put on your armor and I want to put on your shoes. getting ready to go out and preach this gospel of priest the the peace the ministry brother that you were talking about and you get up and go down through there and you lace up your boots and you walk up to that door and you say Lord I'm ready and then shut your mind down &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; look out to whatever it is you're facing and go are you ready for this not to yourself but to Satan cuz he has no arrows. &gt;&gt; He has an empty quiver. &gt;&gt; He don't even have the keys to his own house. &gt;&gt; Why do you think he's trying to get in yours? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He has no place to live. He has nowhere to go. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He's got all of these demons following him and he has nowhere to take them. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Nowhere to set them down, nowhere to feed them unless you let him. That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, don't let him. &gt;&gt; The mistake isn't yours, per se, brothers and sisters. It's Satan's &gt;&gt; forever thinking &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; He could have a child of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because we can praise him and we can love him and we can go to our brothers and sisters in peace knowing that if maybe just maybe they do or we do or something that it can be forgiven because if God doesn't impute sin to us, we don't impute sin to others. &gt;&gt; God forgives us, we can forgive anybody. &gt;&gt; If God can forgive me in my past, he can forgive anybody. So we can take all of that and know without a shadow of a doubt &gt;&gt; we are going home &gt;&gt; because as Paul said I am persuaded brother that nothing nothing nothing can take me away from the love of God. He's done proven it to me too many times. Way too many times. So you can have peace in whatever you're going through, whatever's coming at you, whatever cravings that hit, whatever mental things that come at you, you can have peace and you can praise God and you can fight this fight by simply standing there &gt;&gt; because it's his fight. He'll fight it. You just have to show up. &gt;&gt; But you got to show up. If you fall down, get up. &gt;&gt; Ask for forgiveness. Put it under the blood. Put on your armor. Lace up your boots. Walk out the door. Here am I, Lord. And if you get knocked down, get back up. Put on your armor. Lace up your boots. Walk up to the door. Here am I, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when you get knocked down, get back up and do it all over again. Because come Thursday morning, you're going to walk out that door and you're going to win. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; You're going to manifest what God has already done. &gt;&gt; He already saw you as a conqueror. He already saw you as the overcomer. He has already saw you. And he will give you nothing that you cannot handle. &gt;&gt; He will put nothing on you that he has not already seen you overcome. He has seen it and he's God. He said, "I'm God and I change not." So if he saw you defeat Satan before the foundation of the world, he has not changed his mind now. &gt;&gt; You have still defeated Satan. All we're doing is having the patience and the peace and the praising of God to see the manifestation of it. &gt;&gt; And I cannot fight your battle. &gt;&gt; I cannot win your battle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I can promise you with everything that's in me, I will fight with you. &gt;&gt; I will get on my knees and pray with you if that's what you need. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't be afraid to say, "Hey, I need a little bit of a a push. Can you can you help me out?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's not a very sane man that don't request help when he needs it. And God said, "I am &gt;&gt; that I am." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I was that I was." He said, "I am." And he is the help. &gt;&gt; In a time of trouble, &gt;&gt; it may come from me. It may come from Brother Kobe. It may come from Brother Wendell. But the help is still there. But I can tell you this from experience. If you will believe God, you'll see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Whether you ask for the help or not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But you have to believe. &gt;&gt; You have to believe. We are a body. If we pray together, God will fight every single battle this church has. Every single one of them. God don't step back and say, "No, not today." &gt;&gt; That ain't the God we serve. &gt;&gt; The God we serve said, "It's my battle. You don't have to fight this. I've got this." &gt;&gt; So, if you have those things coming into your mind and saying, "I ain't worthy. I've done too much. Don't listen to it. Forgive yourself. God forgave you. Forgive yourself. Forgive those that you think or may have or think or may have come against you because in all of it is forgiveness because forgiveness and love go hand in hand. But until you can give it to someone else, you must give it to yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; But have peace in the battle, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; because the battle ain't yours and you ain't fighting it and it's already done. Be still &gt;&gt; and believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory. There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus to break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And I'm so thankful for God's divine presence. And we are in a we're we're in a war. We're in a we're in a war for life. But brother, we've already won. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let the worshippers arise. Let the sun sing. I'm surrendering my all. Can I get you boys to bring this chair down here? I'm surrender to the king. Let the worshippers arise. Sing it with all of your heart now. &gt;&gt; Let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. &gt;&gt; We got a treat tonight. Dad is going to Amen. He's going to close the service with with his part. And so, uh, we want him to come at this time. Praise the Lord. and &gt;&gt; and uh we have been so blessed dad having his um energy and and even uh just being able to to talk and and so we just uh we're just glad for that and and you know he's he's been walk he's &gt;&gt; he's even walked a little bit without his walker and uh I don't know about that but But uh we are we this this is a man full of faith &gt;&gt; and um &gt;&gt; and we appreciate we appreciate dad very very much. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we appreciate this opportunity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. had if you would put up on the screen 1 Corinthians 2 and nine. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go right in to the message. &gt;&gt; But as it is written, I have not seen nor heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. Going to the next verse. But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God, knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God, which things we do speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spir spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, &gt;&gt; neither can he know them, because they are spirit spiritually discerned. &gt;&gt; But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him. But we have the mind of Christ. Now let's go to f Ephesians 1 and start at the 8th verse. When he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, which are on the earth, even in him. Now go to the 15th verse. Let me let me go and read that. Read that one. Go back to go back to the level. And then we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the council of his own will. Now go to the 15th verse. Wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to make mention of you in my prayers that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. The eyes of your understanding. Notice that. The eyes of your understanding. &gt;&gt; It's not the eyes of man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's the eyes of your understanding. being enlightened, being given revelation that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every every name that's named. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not not only this world but also that which is to come. &gt;&gt; Yes. To come. And I put on all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church. &gt;&gt; Which is his body, the fullness of him that fillth all and all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Name which is named every name which is named. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Kind of broke me up there. Think about Parkinson's. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's about that name is given power to the church over all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I've been thanking for some time and I actually preached this message back in Pac and we're living in the fulfillment of this scripture. &gt;&gt; Okay. in Ephesians 1 and 10 where it says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times. Well, you know that Paul also wrote concerning the dispensation of the fullness of times in Romans the 11th chapter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. when it's talking about when the dispensation of the fullst times talking about the gentile when it comes to the close. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we're living in this dispensation. &gt;&gt; We see also according to Luke 17:30 the 29th verse actually starts where it said as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes. The scripture said that eyes not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those that love him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Man today has put God out of their consciousness. &gt;&gt; They put God out of their memory. &gt;&gt; And the scripture said in John 1 or I believe Acts 33 that Christ in him was light. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the light was in the world, but the world recognized him not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, that's funny. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if it's light, surely you can see light. &gt;&gt; But they were blinded. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And so man of their knowledge and their intellect has forsaken Christ the found of living waters. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If he not themselves sisters that can hold no water. &gt;&gt; But Paul said and if in 1 Corinthians 2 he he said that God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Come on. For the spirit searchth all things, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; yay. The deep things of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the the world today because they've rejected Christ, they've left their own imag imaginations. &gt;&gt; And walking after their own thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But we've cast down imaginations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've cast them down. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because we've seen light. &gt;&gt; We've seen &gt;&gt; the glory of God. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm going to close it pretty quick. I want you to turn to Isaiah 40. Full of Isaiah 40. about the 30th verse. I believe it did. &gt;&gt; Go back up to verse 28. Has thou not known? Has thou not heard that they everlasting? God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, faintth not. He is weary. &gt;&gt; There is no searching of his understanding. &gt;&gt; He hath given power to faint, &gt;&gt; to them that have no might. increases strength. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Even the youth shall faint, be weary, and the young men shall utterly fail. &gt;&gt; But they that wait upon the Lord &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength. &gt;&gt; They shall mount up with the wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Okay, summing all this up, &gt;&gt; I have not seen nor heard, neither have it into the heart of man the things that God hath prepared for those that love him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just think we're walking in the light of this hour, this day. &gt;&gt; It's because God has prepared it for us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That makes you a special people. Yes. &gt;&gt; You're not just anyone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But Paul in in visions what 10th verse in this section of full times he &gt;&gt; he shall together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In one all things even in Christ &gt;&gt; both which are in heaven which are in earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Every name written in the lamb's book of life in heaven. He's gathered together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. here on the earth. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; leave that in the eagle for just a minute. Years ago, we first first time we were in Arizona, I was under a burden and I just I really wanted to get to the people and I wanted them to catch the revelation and what God was doing in our day. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I was under his burden. I went out to the place where I this little place where I enjoyed going to pray up in further up in the mountains and it come a snowstorm and the sun broke through and it's real pristine, beautiful, white. I got out of my truck and the first thing I seen about 15 feet above me out of the way. First on a tree branch were three eagles and I was fascinated with them eagles. They didn't fly away. They sat there to watch me. I was watching them and it come to me that they represented the first, second, and third pool. And I as I was thinking about that, I seen five caught movement way up above in in the sky. I turned around and looked and there was another eagle. And the eagle had his wings spread. He was just going around in circles. He was not beating the wind. He was not fighting to gain altitude. He was not fighting to stay there. But he had caught him a draft, an upper draft. Just spread them wings up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's circling around &gt;&gt; right that draft. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's just going higher and higher and higher until finally it was just a speck. Then it was no more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Out of sight. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I cried. I thought, &gt;&gt; Lord, you brought us through these three pools. &gt;&gt; First, second, and third pool. It's rapturing time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the church according to Ephesians. We're in his body, the fullness of him which filth all in all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's the head of the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're not walking our own power, our own might, but we're walking in his. And when we just got to wait spread out, &gt;&gt; oh God, &gt;&gt; and rest &gt;&gt; not struggling, &gt;&gt; not fighting, &gt;&gt; not worrying, but just simply resting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the spirit carries higher and higher and higher. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We're far above all the things in this world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I thought about brother Brandon 1956 starting in 56, 57, 58, 59. He was warning America. You received a visitation. I predict you'll flatly turn it down. He went on to say in 58 57 we know that the wheels are turning. We can see in the newspaper everywhere we look wheels are turning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; 59 he warned us. Then in 60 61 62 62 he preached the indictment. Then in 63 he broke the seals. It was at that point that everybody pulled back from him because they couldn't understand the mystery of the seals. But God had prepared them for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He's renewed our strength. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The ministry of the seventh angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. &gt;&gt; Would you turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He renewed our strength. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Has eagles. There's that eagle. Brother said the seal and said there was four beasts. There was the lion. There was there was a &gt;&gt; the ox there was the beast with the head of man. &gt;&gt; Then there was the eagle. He said the first three beast were earthly bound. &gt;&gt; But the eagle was heavenly &gt;&gt; bound. So the first three feast they had to endure. They had to go through crimson &gt;&gt; church. &gt;&gt; They had to go through all that they went through. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the eagle &gt;&gt; wouldn't earthly bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. He soared above all of the confusion, &gt;&gt; above all the false knock false teach and restored us back. Renewed our strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lay the weight upon the Lord. She renewed their strength. &gt;&gt; I was in Pentecost. I was born 1950 and it was the golden time. Pentecost had the great moves, the great revivals, but they the young Pentecostal church ran fast, ran hard. They just knew that that was it. But they ran out of strength. They ran out of energy. But they the wait upon the Lord. I I can remember my own testimony in my own life that there was something more. There'd be something I sent my wife stood my wife at the corner of fourth in Lev take me to the place in Claremore. I come out of church. I stood out there with her. I said there's got to be more than this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's got to be more than blown sandwiches. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I said there's got to be some steak. &gt;&gt; There's got to be somebody singing her teeth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I said, "I'm I'm determined to search and search and search search these scriptures till I I can find what I'm looking for." Said in there somewhere and I got stuck in Ephesians and I just studied forward and backward in Ephesians and Ephesians and Ephesians. And then I preached out Ephesians visions. Every time I preach visions and people think you're wearing the ground, no, I'm looking for something. There's something in visions. It was the book of redemption. Found out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so I was one of the many eagles that just waited. I just waited. Just waiting that come in contact with the message of brother Bradom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it took me a while to get settled in because of my Pentecostal upbringing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I had so much to sh to shed &gt;&gt; to get rid of. But &gt;&gt; wow. &gt;&gt; I was just kind of I kind like that eagle that was molting. &gt;&gt; He go up into the the cave high in the mountain. &gt;&gt; There'd be three things. had be sharp jagged rocks that come out of the the walls of the cave. There had to be honey. There had to be water dripping from the ceiling. And that vehicle he would take he would beat his wings against the sharpjacking rocks and beat out all them old feathers. Then he would take and rub his beak against that against that wall down to a nub. Then because he couldn't eat, he could only suck. He sucked that honey. This took place 40 days. When he come out, Amen. He may have been 100 years old, but his strength had been renewed as as a young one. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I felt like that that was my testimony is I just would steal away and my my 10 k folk didn't understand me. They brother and I real close. We married married si sisters. We had a double wedding. &gt;&gt; We're just close. But he couldn't understand where I was going. He could understand what I was doing. &gt;&gt; I didn't understand. &gt;&gt; So I couldn't expect him to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I I plied ahead. &gt;&gt; It caused a great breach between us. But I I loved him. But I just I just couldn't stop you was waiting on the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That eagle went to be in the center of cry 193. We'd come through the first pool, the second pool. Everybody went through that. Everybody loved brother Brandham because of the gifts that was in his life. Oh, when the third P started, they all pulled back. &gt;&gt; But I had not seen nor you heard, neither have entered the heart of man, the things that God has prepared for those that love him. We caught the revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In 69, we put man on the moon. And the first thing that Neil Armstrong said when he touched down in that lunar landing vehicle, he said, "The eagle hath landed." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "The moon taps at the church reflecting the glory of the sun." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "Deal have landed." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, it kind of reminded me of the cowboy philosopher Will Rogers. I seen a little clip where he is getting prepared to go overseas. They asked him a series of questions and asked him, "Are you an American?" He t back lean on the counter and said, "Well, I reckon my people were here to greet the pillars when So they were rejoicing that they landed on the moon. Well, spiritually speaking, we we were there to greet him. &gt;&gt; That's not seen nor you heard. Neither had there to the heart of man the things that God prepared for those that love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I cease not to make me much of you in my prayers that God will give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Jesus Christ that you may know the riches of his inheritance in the saints the exceeded greatness of his power to us. Aren't you glad for that? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here we are. We're living in legal time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the time when we need to spread wings out and just soar and soar and soar, &gt;&gt; not downward, but high up. For God has sent in his spirit of revelation. things higher &gt;&gt; and higher &gt;&gt; and higher. It s of course &gt;&gt; I hope that I was able to convey my thought. &gt;&gt; I'm going to rise rise rise above it all. I'm going to rise. Rise. I'm going to spread my wings, fly away to heaven. I'm going &gt;&gt; Oh, sing it now. Are Are you going to rise above it all? &gt;&gt; Rise above it all. &gt;&gt; Spread your wings, little eagle. My wings of it all.

You're the only one through. If you've not loving him the way that you used to love him. If your heart is not just bleeding to be with him, why don't we just renew our love to him here tonight? Because truly, he's been so good to us. The sermons that were brought here tonight, Brother Kobe, praising him. No matter what you're in, you've got to praise him. Brother Harry saying, "Make sure that there's no alts or anything that will hinder anything between you and your brother, you and God." Brother Miguel coming in taking the sward of the enemy. No matter what Satan has brought, you can go back to the no matter where you are right now. Maybe the devil's trying to hide the purpose from you, but you can go back, grab the sword of that enemy that you cut the head off with. Brother John preaching math don't matter. That's not always accurate. you and God as a majority. Dad ending it here tonight being renewed like the Eagles. We are an eagle generation. I say tonight, Lord, I love you. After a service like this, it should do something to our hearts. I I love you and I want to love you more. I want to walk with you in humility. I want to I want to give of myself to you. As we sing this song, why don't you make it a a desperate cry of the soul? I love you. Sometimes things can get a little common. That commonality between you and God can just we get used to coming to church. We get used to just but let's not get used let's not make God religion. Let's not may it be a reality. Lord, I love you. the first church age, he says, "I've got one thing against you. You've left that first love. This last church age, Christ is totally out of the church." And the only common, the only place that you're going to find love is in the bride. So, oh God, don't ever let love leave me. Don't let love leave me. That's why we got to be hid in him. We got to stay in him. Stay in that that secret place with him. That third pool is to keep the life, preserve the life. Cuz we ain't going to get it out there. We're not going to find the kind of love. I don't care people being we the only love we're going to find. The genuine love is going to be in you. guard that sacred fire. You've got that third pool. You and you alone are in that secret place with God. You and you alone. Brother Brandham said it was an absolute secret. There was no way to even understand how it worked. They came in crippled. They walked out a hole. They came in and they walked out. It's that secret place. It's preserved just for you, my friend. It's built for you. It was given for you. It's for no one else. The presidents won't have it. Religion won't have it. Denominations won't have it. That secret place with God, that third pull ministry, that you and God alone in the confines of his living word, that's the greatest gift that we could ever have. Don't let anything take that away from you. Love him. Love this message. Let's all sing it to him now with a real genuine heart. Yes, I love you. Yes. Oh, yes. I love you. I love you.
