[24:35] we're going to read in the uh page
[24:39] 299 and we're going to stay in the
[24:42] same um along the same vein that we were
[24:46] the other night and um and uh the last
[24:50] Wednesday night we want to deal a little
[24:52] bit more with the gifts in the
[24:54] church and um and
[24:58] uh so I want we're going to read here
[25:03] 299 and I want to um see to it that we
[25:08] see um where brother brandham and the
[25:12] and where the scripture is is showing us
[25:15] the the Supernatural and why the devil
[25:19] wants to counterfeit it there's a reason
[25:22] he wants to counterfeit this and um um
[25:26] he he wouldn't want to counterfeit it if
[25:28] it if it if if it wasn't so important
[25:32] but it is important it's very important
[25:34] in the church and so um now the this is
[25:38] we're going to be reading out of the
[25:39] Philadelphian Church
[25:41] age and brother brother brandham is is
[25:44] just going to be telling us now it took
[25:46] the third um uh matters of fact we'll
[25:49] just let's just read there in in 299 I
[25:52] wasn't going to read that second
[25:53] paragraph but let's go and read it he
[25:55] says I want you to see something here
[25:58] God Works in threes doesn't he he was in
[26:01] the third or pergam pergam Manan age
[26:04] that the church was married to the state
[26:07] the Deeds of the nicians had become the
[26:10] doctrines of the nicians that age was
[26:13] the open door for the false Vine once it
[26:16] was backed up by the power of the state
[26:19] it become actually a world system even
[26:22] though it bore the name
[26:24] Christian thus it spread like wildfire
[26:29] but now Three Ages later after a long
[26:31] and hard struggle of Faith here comes
[26:34] the open door to the truth the word of
[26:36] the Lord now has its day of course the
[26:39] fifth age had set the stage of this
[26:42] Mighty move as the age gave us
[26:45] exploration colonization printing of
[26:47] books Etc now that's the the um the ages
[26:52] that fifth age that was Lutheran age now
[26:55] this here is the wesling age he says it
[26:58] would have been
[26:59] wonderful if this Open Door had followed
[27:03] the Divine pattern of Pentecost which
[27:06] was set forth in Hebrews 2
[27:09] 1-4 therefore we ought to give more
[27:12] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[27:14] heard lest at any time we should let
[27:17] them slip for if the words spoken by
[27:20] Angels were steadfast and every
[27:22] transgression and Disobedience received
[27:25] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[27:28] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[27:32] which at the first began to be spoken by
[27:35] the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
[27:38] them that heard him God also bearing
[27:41] them witness both with signs and wonders
[27:45] diverse Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost
[27:48] according to his own will now you know
[27:52] now you know that this is the pattern
[27:54] for Jesus himself said so Mark 16 15- 20
[28:00] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[28:02] world preach the gospel to Every
[28:05] Creature he that believeth and is
[28:07] baptized shall be saved he that
[28:10] believeth not shall be damned and these
[28:12] signs shall follow them that believe in
[28:15] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[28:18] shall speak with new tongues and they
[28:20] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[28:23] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[28:26] they shall lay hands on this sick and
[28:28] they shall recover so then after the
[28:31] Lord had spoken these unto them he was
[28:34] received up into heaven and set on the
[28:36] right hand of God and they went forth
[28:39] and preached everywhere and the Lord
[28:42] working with them confirming the word
[28:44] with signs following amen he never told
[28:48] them to go into all the world and
[28:50] establish Bible colleges nor did he tell
[28:53] them to pass out literature now those
[28:55] things are fine but what Jes Jesus told
[28:58] them to do was to preach the gospel
[29:02] stick with the word and then the signs
[29:05] would follow ver the very first
[29:08] introduction we have in the in the way
[29:10] of the kingdom of God was preached when
[29:12] he was sent when he sent out the 12
[29:15] Matthew 10 1-8 he commissioned and
[29:19] instructed them on this wise when he had
[29:22] called unto him his 12 disciples and
[29:25] gave them power against unclean spirits
[29:29] to cast them out to heal all manner of
[29:32] sick and all manner of disease now the
[29:34] names of the twel Apostles are these
[29:36] first Simon who was called Peter and
[29:39] Andrew his brother James the son of
[29:41] Zebedee John his brother Phillip and bar
[29:46] baralu and Thomas and matthus the uh
[29:51] Publican James the son of alfus and laus
[29:54] whose surname is thus uh Simon the
[29:57] Canaanite night Judas iscar who also
[29:59] betrayed him these 12 Jesus sent forth
[30:03] and commanded them saying go not into
[30:06] the way of the
[30:08] Gentiles and into any city of the
[30:10] Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to
[30:14] the uh to the lost sheep of the House of
[30:16] Israel and as ye preach saying the
[30:19] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the
[30:22] sick cleanse the leper raise the Dead
[30:25] cast out Devils freely heal have
[30:28] received freely give now this ministry
[30:32] that he gave them was actually the
[30:33] sharing of his own Ministry with them
[30:36] for it says in Matthew 9 and
[30:39] 35-38 Jesus went about all the cities
[30:43] and Villages teaching in their
[30:46] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[30:48] the Kingdom healing EV every sickness
[30:52] and every disease among the people and
[30:54] when he saw the multitudes he was moved
[30:56] with compassion on them them because
[30:59] they fainted and were scattered abroad
[31:01] as sheep having no Shepherd then he said
[31:04] unto his disciples the Harvest truly is
[31:07] plenteous but the laborers are few pray
[31:11] ye therefore the lord of the Harvest
[31:13] that he will send forth labors into his
[31:17] Harvest now many people have the idea
[31:20] that just the apostles has this ministry
[31:24] given them by the Lord Jesus and so when
[31:26] they died the ministry was over that is
[31:29] not so here in Luke 10 1-9 we find that
[31:33] in the last days of his Earthly Journey
[31:36] he had already started to give ministers
[31:39] uh give ministries of power to his
[31:42] own after these things the Lord
[31:44] appointed other 70 also and sent them
[31:47] two by two before his face into every
[31:49] city and place whether he himself would
[31:52] come therefore said he unto them the
[31:55] Harvest is truly truly is great but the
[31:58] laborers are few pray ye therefore the
[32:01] lord of the Harvest that he would send
[32:03] forth labors into his uh labors into his
[32:06] Harvest go your ways behold I send you
[32:09] forth as Lambs among the wolves carry
[32:12] neither purses nor script nor shoes and
[32:15] salute no one no man by the way into
[32:18] whatsoever house you enter first say
[32:21] peace be to this house and if the son of
[32:24] peace be there your peace shall rest
[32:27] upon it if not ye shall turn you again
[32:30] and in the same house remaining um uh
[32:35] and in the same house remaining eating
[32:37] and drinking such thing as they give for
[32:39] the laborers worthy of his hire go not
[32:42] from house to house and into whatsoever
[32:44] City ye enter and they receive you eat
[32:47] such things that are set before you heal
[32:50] the sick that are therein and say unto
[32:52] them the kingdom of God is nigh unto you
[32:56] who would dare deny the the mighty
[32:58] Ministry of Phillip who would dare to
[33:01] deny the minist mighty ministries of
[33:03] irus Martin Columba Patrick countless
[33:07] scores of others who had God's anointing
[33:09] upon them yes the Bible Way is the real
[33:13] way of the open door I want to add my
[33:16] testimony to that the reason I have to
[33:19] do that is because I can only speak with
[33:21] Assurance concerning what God has done
[33:23] in my own life and if you'll excuse a
[33:26] personal note here I will tell you how I
[33:29] know for assurity that Jesus is the same
[33:32] yesterday today and forever and that
[33:35] that the power of God is still available
[33:39] to those who will believe and receive
[33:42] aren't you glad for that the power of
[33:45] God is still for those who will believe
[33:47] it and receive it during my missionary
[33:50] trip to South Africa God so blessed that
[33:54] I came to Durban the only place that
[33:56] could begin to accommodate the people
[33:59] was the huge racetrack which is the
[34:01] second largest in the world and the
[34:03] crowd was well over a
[34:05] 100,000 in order to keep Law and Order
[34:08] they had to put up fences to separate
[34:10] the various tribes they posted hundreds
[34:12] of policemen to keep the throngs quieted
[34:15] down those hungry Souls had come for
[34:18] many miles a queen from rhasia had come
[34:22] with a train of of 27 coaches loaded
[34:26] with uh African natives
[34:28] they struggled in across the fields and
[34:30] mountains and bearing on their backs for
[34:33] many and many a mile some loved one that
[34:37] needed help the whole country was
[34:39] stirred by the mighty works that had
[34:41] been manifested by the Holy Spirit one
[34:44] afternoon as I began to minister one of
[34:47] thousands of the muhammadans came up on
[34:49] the platform and as she stood before me
[34:52] a missionary to the muhammadans begin to
[34:55] softly implore the Lord
[34:58] oh for this pre that precious Soul oh
[35:01] for that precious Soul he had been over
[35:03] there for years and years according to
[35:06] his own testimony he had only he had
[35:08] seen only one Muhammad had come to
[35:11] receive Jesus Christ as Savior they were
[35:14] originally the mle Persians whose law
[35:16] changed not they are hard to win it
[35:20] seems once a Muhammad and always a
[35:22] muhammadan is is a law amongst them well
[35:25] as she stood before me I begin to speak
[35:27] to her and to all those thousands
[35:29] through the interpreters I said is it
[35:32] not so that the missionaries have told
[35:34] you of a Jesus who would come to save
[35:36] you you should have seen the people look
[35:39] at each other when I said that and when
[35:41] they had answered uh that I was correct
[35:44] I went on and said but did the
[35:46] missionaries read you out of this book I
[35:51] uh the I held up my Bible a loft for
[35:53] them to see that the same Jesus was a
[35:55] mighty healer and that he that he would
[35:59] live in his people down Through the Ages
[36:02] until he come again to receive them unto
[36:04] himself they uh did did they tell you
[36:08] that because of that same spirit in them
[36:11] that was in Jesus that they would be
[36:14] able to do the mighty works as Jesus did
[36:17] did they tell you that you can be healed
[36:21] even as you can be saved how many of you
[36:24] would like to see the same Jesus come
[36:26] down amongst us and do the same things
[36:29] he did when he was here on Earth long
[36:31] ago they all wanted that that is one
[36:34] thing they surely agreed on I then went
[36:38] on if Jesus by his
[36:41] spirit will do what he did upon the
[36:44] Earth uh what he did upon the Earth will
[36:47] you believe his word then and here was
[36:49] that Muhammad woman in front of me the
[36:51] spirit began to move through me I said
[36:54] to her now I know that you know that I
[36:57] don't know know you I can't even speak
[36:59] your language she admitted that I said
[37:03] as for healing you you know I can not
[37:06] but you heard the message this afternoon
[37:08] and understood me her Indian
[37:11] interpreter answered back uh for her
[37:14] that she understood for she had read the
[37:16] New Testament now the muhammadans are
[37:19] are descendants of Abraham they believe
[37:22] in one God but they reject Jesus as the
[37:24] Son of God and instead they take muhamad
[37:27] as his prophet and they say that Jesus
[37:31] never died and rose again they are
[37:33] taught that by their priest and they
[37:35] believe it I said but Jesus did die and
[37:39] rise again he sent his Spirit back upon
[37:42] the church and the spirit that was in
[37:45] him is the same spirit in the church now
[37:49] and it can and will produce what Jesus
[37:52] produced he said in John 5:19 the son
[37:56] can do nothing of him self but what he
[37:58] sees the father do for what things
[38:01] soever he doeth these also doeth the son
[38:04] likewise now then if Jesus will come and
[38:09] reveal to me what your trouble is or
[38:12] what you are here for if he can tell me
[38:15] what your past is surely you can believe
[38:18] for the future and she said through her
[38:20] interpreter yes I can I said all right
[38:23] may he do it those muhammadans are
[38:26] watching intently and they're all
[38:27] leaning forward to see what would happen
[38:30] then the Holy Spirit spoke your husband
[38:31] is a short heavy set man with a black
[38:34] mustache you have two children you were
[38:36] at the doctors about 3 days ago and he
[38:38] gave you an examination you have a cyst
[38:41] on the womb she bowed her head and said
[38:43] that is true I asked her how is it that
[38:46] you came to me a Christian why didn't
[38:48] you go to your Muhammad and priest she
[38:51] said I think you can help me I said I
[38:53] can't help you but if you receive Jesus
[38:56] Christ as your savior
[38:58] he who is here now and knows all about
[39:00] you he'll help you and she says Jesus is
[39:04] she she said I accept Jesus as my savior
[39:07] and that did it she was healed and about
[39:10] 10,000 mohammadans came to Christ that
[39:13] day because the gospel was preached in
[39:15] both word and power God never told a man
[39:18] to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he
[39:21] gave us the open door of the word and
[39:23] power and that is what we are supposed
[39:26] to use can I hear anything
[39:27] amen that is what gave Paul his great
[39:31] effective Ministry 1 Corinthians 2 and 4
[39:35] my speech and my preaching was not with
[39:37] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[39:40] the demonstration of the spirit and of
[39:42] power listen to me now it was it was
[39:46] while I was on the same trip that I was
[39:49] boarding a plane in New Salisbury uh
[39:53] rhasia that I saw a party of four with
[39:55] American passports and I went over to
[39:57] them and said hello there I see you have
[39:59] American passports are you traveling
[40:02] somewhere and the young man answered me
[40:04] no we are all missionaries here how nice
[40:08] I replied are you on your own or do you
[40:10] work with some organization we are
[40:13] Methodist we come from Wilmore Kentucky
[40:15] he said well that's almost in my
[40:17] backyard I replied you wouldn't be that
[40:20] brother brandham that comes up uh comes
[40:23] up that way would
[40:25] you I said yes that's right that cured
[40:29] him he wouldn't say any any another
[40:32] thing and the way he and those girls
[40:36] just look back and forth at each other
[40:37] so I said just a minute son I'd like to
[40:40] speak to you all about some principles
[40:43] seeing you all are Christians and here
[40:45] for a great purpose now you say you all
[40:49] have been here uh you four have been
[40:52] here for two
[40:54] years can you say in the name of Jesus
[40:57] that you can put a finger on one so that
[40:59] you know you have one to the Lord they
[41:02] could not I don't want to hurt your
[41:05] feelings girls I said but you ought to
[41:08] be home helping your mothers with dishes
[41:10] you hav't any business on the field
[41:12] unless you are filled with the Holy
[41:13] Ghost preaching the true gospel in the
[41:17] demonstration of the power of the Holy
[41:19] Ghost if you're not seeing the results
[41:22] that Jesus said you would see it's
[41:26] because you're not preaching the true
[41:29] gospel can you say Amen now so you can
[41:34] see amen you can see where the
[41:38] importance of this of this amen the the
[41:42] the power of the Holy Spirit the Holy
[41:44] Ghost is the power of God it's what
[41:50] anoints the word and as Believers we're
[41:54] not we are not called to just come and
[41:57] set in church and have song service and
[41:59] preach to each other we are to live
[42:02] powerful lives anointed lives lives that
[42:06] can set the captives free that's what
[42:10] the original church had and that's what
[42:13] God's commissioned us to do Amen brother
[42:16] brother brandom if you'd go back to page
[42:18] uh page 90 we've already read this in
[42:21] the past but um what what would what did
[42:24] the church first church fall from and
[42:26] would just going to read two paragraphs
[42:28] here page 90 and um and we're going to
[42:33] start there at the second paragraph and
[42:36] when you're there just say
[42:38] Amen all right it says God tells them to
[42:42] remember evidently something had left
[42:44] their minds that this is to the Ephesian
[42:47] Church they had forgotten something he
[42:50] told them to turn back in their minds to
[42:52] their point of origin the origin of the
[42:56] first age was
[42:57] Pentecost they had fallen from it they
[43:00] had forgotten the glory and wonder of it
[43:05] it was time to go back in mind and then
[43:08] in reality back to when they could say
[43:11] for me to live as Christ back to Purity
[43:14] when ananas and safias safaris was dealt
[43:17] with back to the gate beautiful oh what
[43:20] a reproach it is to drift from God and
[43:23] countenance those
[43:25] acts that that that defile his name let
[43:28] those who name his name depart from sin
[43:31] and keep your vessels pure for God look
[43:34] at what you once were in your mind and
[43:36] heart in your life then go back to it
[43:39] and what is the way back the way is the
[43:42] way of repentance if a sinner has to
[43:44] come to God by the way of repentance
[43:46] then the lukewarm or backslider will
[43:48] have to repent uh that much more repent
[43:52] bring bring forth fruit uh uh yeah bring
[43:56] forth fruit meet for repentance prove it
[43:59] by your life if you do not repent said
[44:02] God I will remove your Candlestick
[44:04] certainly a church in that condition
[44:07] can't give light to the world its light
[44:10] has turned to Darkness God will take it
[44:14] take away its faithful messenger and its
[44:17] faithful Shepherds and leave them to
[44:19] themselves and they will go on talking
[44:23] about
[44:24] Christianity but be bereft of it can you
[44:28] say Amen so so we can see the
[44:33] importance the the importance of the of
[44:37] of that of of of of the Holy Spirit
[44:41] Pentecost and what and and what the
[44:44] church that first church was amen
[44:48] now um uh brother uh brother brandham if
[44:51] You' just put that first chart up sister
[44:53] khila brother brandham this is what he
[44:56] said in 19
[44:57] 65 he says he says Jesus said I am the
[45:01] light and you are in him how do you get
[45:06] into him joining him no shaking no
[45:11] baptism of water no by one Spirit are we
[45:16] all baptized into one body which is the
[45:19] body of Christ and in that body is nine
[45:24] spiritual gifts operating through
[45:27] through the local body the local church
[45:31] that's Apostolic if I ever knew it
[45:34] that's right so so when when you when
[45:38] you hear and you see on the internet and
[45:41] you and you hear other preachers that
[45:43] are saying that that is no longer all we
[45:46] need is the word that's the only thing
[45:50] the word will produce the Living Word
[45:53] produces a living Christ logos living
[45:59] logos brother brandom says it was the
[46:01] logos that brooded over the ground in
[46:04] the beginning that brought up the botle
[46:06] life that brought up the animal life it
[46:08] was it was the pillar of fire brooding
[46:12] over the seed and when we have the true
[46:15] word of God the holy spirit is to come
[46:18] and brood over that word and make that
[46:21] word to live in
[46:23] us that's what makes Christianity it's
[46:27] not another religion it is the life of
[46:30] God can you say Amen did you know that
[46:33] brother bradam said there are gifts in
[46:36] the church right now we're already in
[46:40] that local assembly go ahead and go to
[46:42] that second that second chart there uh
[46:44] sister keys he says but you can't speak
[46:47] in tongues Les you have um uh see oh I
[46:52] gave you
[46:53] the yeah that's that's the right one uh
[46:55] and and no doubt at all but what there's
[46:58] many of the many gifts of that in this
[47:02] church right now there's many of gifts
[47:06] of it here in the Methodist Church uh in
[47:08] the Baptist Church but if it was only
[47:11] preached so the gift could go away from
[47:14] it one let's go to that third chart just
[47:16] real quickly then we're going to read a
[47:18] little bit in the book of Acts praise
[47:20] the Lord how many's enjoying yourself
[47:21] tonight amen now now this is going to be
[47:24] a little bit harder to read I I um I I
[47:27] should have broke that down a little bit
[47:28] more amen he says now you take a tree
[47:32] and put it away from water and the first
[47:35] thing you know you got little old apples
[47:38] and that are all naughty and worm eaten
[47:41] and and cast uh but it casts its crop
[47:45] and that's what's the matter with the
[47:46] churches today you've done got away from
[47:50] that River you've got away from them
[47:53] gifts of the Spirit they got just a
[47:56] church now natural and they get away
[47:59] from the spiritual gifts and the
[48:01] spiritual things and they cast their
[48:03] fruits what do they do they're Believers
[48:06] live with the world act like the world
[48:09] steal cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble Bunko
[48:12] games in the church to pay the preacher
[48:15] and everything else super suppers dances
[48:17] they cast their fruits it's just like
[48:20] the world and the unbeliever look and
[48:22] say there's no difference in that in
[48:25] between them and me can you say Amen so
[48:28] now I I I I want us to just look here
[48:31] there is a church that God puts his
[48:36] stamp of approval upon and the power of
[48:39] the Holy Ghost is not a dirty word amen
[48:44] and matters of fact I would say if there
[48:47] is anything that we should be hungering
[48:49] for more today more than games and more
[48:53] than television and and we should be
[48:56] hungering more than than uh uh
[49:00] boyfriends girlfriends whatever else it
[49:04] should be that the power of the Holy
[49:08] Spirit would flow through US amen now
[49:12] now there in the we're going to read a
[49:13] little bit I'm going to share amen of of
[49:16] some of the gifts of the Spirit that
[49:17] that had operated in the in that first
[49:19] church because brother bradam says we've
[49:22] got to go back to Pentecost and so uh
[49:25] we're going to look at a at a a few read
[49:27] a few of the stories there uh tonight
[49:30] now now the church was filled with the
[49:32] Holy Ghost in Acts 2 and then the Bible
[49:35] says that they were refilled with the
[49:37] Holy Ghost in Acts four you know what
[49:38] that tells me amen if you've got the
[49:40] Holy Ghost here tonight uh you can still
[49:43] have a refilling I believe there's
[49:44] refilling upon refilling of the Holy
[49:46] Ghost and what God done for you in the
[49:49] yester years amen what God done for you
[49:52] and the Miracles you've seen and the and
[49:54] and the power of God that how God used
[49:56] you in your life a he's still the same
[49:59] God all you've got to do as we read that
[50:02] as we read that one amen is we got to
[50:04] repent go back and say God I need a
[50:07] refilling of your Holy Spirit I need a
[50:10] renewing it doesn't mean that you lose
[50:13] the Holy Ghost amen it's just a amen
[50:16] it's just a a stirring of the water
[50:18] stirring of your amen expectation let
[50:21] the holy ghost live it's it's the same
[50:23] thing you have to do with your marriage
[50:25] you can't you can't you you can't go
[50:27] without telling your wife you love her
[50:29] you can't go without taking her out to
[50:31] eat and and if she's cranky and and and
[50:34] and that sort of thing well you can
[50:36] complain about it amen or if he's cranky
[50:39] but but but why don't you do something
[50:41] about it and most of the time there's
[50:43] just got to be an oldfashioned falling
[50:46] in love again and saying you know amen
[50:49] we I I I I I don't care about my side
[50:52] your side I just want the origins I want
[50:55] the origin of love I want it to come
[50:58] back to its Beginnings can you say amen
[51:01] and that's the way we want now another
[51:04] thing I want you to notice now if there
[51:06] there are six places I believe there is
[51:08] in the book of Acts that says the
[51:12] gift of the Holy Ghost amen so there is
[51:16] one gift amen what is the Holy Ghost
[51:19] well it's the person of God himself amen
[51:23] it's eternal life it's the living Pres
[51:26] presence of God in
[51:30] you the gifts of the Holy Ghost amen
[51:35] these are the
[51:37] manifestations of the Holy Ghost these
[51:40] are gifts that are given amen now you
[51:43] can have you can
[51:46] have you can have gifts and not have the
[51:49] Holy Ghost but you cannot have the Holy
[51:53] Ghost and not have the gifts in your
[51:58] life you say I don't know of any gifts
[52:02] in my life amen they're there they're
[52:05] there if you've got the Holy Ghost the
[52:08] gifts are there now you don't
[52:11] manufacture them you can't manufacture
[52:13] them what's the requirement God you've
[52:17] saved me for a purpose you've given me
[52:20] the Holy Ghost for a purpose and I want
[52:24] these gifts to live and manifest if you
[52:28] notice the Apostle Paul says the
[52:30] manifestations of the nine spiritual
[52:33] gifts can you say amen I can't teach you
[52:35] to prophesy I can't teach you to speak
[52:38] in tongues amen whatever gift is laying
[52:42] in you and God gives that the Bible says
[52:44] he gives it severally to whomsoever he
[52:47] will can you say amen and so amen when
[52:50] we look amen the the reason for them
[52:54] what why they're in Sister keys if you
[52:55] wouldn't mind put up there acts 1 and8
[52:58] just real quickly and I and you don't
[53:00] have to turn there because you've
[53:01] already read this many of times but ye
[53:03] shall receive power after that the Holy
[53:07] Ghost comes upon you for what reason to
[53:10] be Witnesses unto him so the purpose for
[53:16] the purpose for the Holy Ghost and the
[53:19] power of the Holy Ghost is to be a
[53:22] witness of that Heavenly Kingdom amen
[53:25] sister Keys uh there acts 5 and 32 amen
[53:29] acts 5:32 and it says and we are his
[53:33] Witnesses of these things and so is also
[53:37] the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to
[53:41] them that obey him so if you obey him
[53:44] you repent amen and and and the Holy
[53:47] Ghost comes upon you then the Holy Ghost
[53:51] In You becomes a witness of the
[53:55] supernatural you're not manufacturing it
[53:57] you're not making it up you we're not
[54:00] having to Voodoo with the music we're
[54:02] not having to I me do no no no no no the
[54:05] gifts are there to them who will
[54:09] surrender themselves to that
[54:12] gift now as we discussed the other
[54:16] night last Wednesday night is
[54:20] um many many times we we think that
[54:23] there's only that there's only two gifts
[54:26] okay amen prophecy and and uh uh
[54:29] prophecy and speaking in tongues amen
[54:31] well there's a lotch of them there's the
[54:33] gift of faith there's the gift of
[54:35] Miracles there's the gifts of healing
[54:38] there's the gift of Prophecy there's the
[54:40] gift of tongues and interpretation of
[54:42] tongues and I have and the gift of
[54:44] wisdom and I've got two more amen um the
[54:48] gift so so gift of knowledge gift of
[54:52] knowledge amen and and so uh so these
[54:56] are gifts and you can see them on
[54:59] display here in the in the book of Acts
[55:02] now I also want to say this amen uh um
[55:06] as we get as we get ready if you want to
[55:08] turn if you want to turn to um let's
[55:12] just turn to Acts 3 and 6 amen but we we
[55:16] we find that there's three different
[55:18] ways that the Holy Ghost fell in the
[55:19] book of Acts amen acts two is the
[55:23] clothing tongues of fire was seen they
[55:25] came down upon them amen and then acts
[55:29] two or or the second form was over there
[55:32] in in in in Acts 10 and44 in the house
[55:36] of Cornelius while Peter preached the
[55:39] word the Holy Ghost fell upon them is
[55:42] that right and then you find over there
[55:44] in Acts uh the 8th chapter and the 14th
[55:48] verse that the holy ghost that they had
[55:50] repented they had been baptized but as
[55:52] of yet the Holy Ghost had came over on
[55:55] on hadn't came on any of them and and
[55:57] the apostles laid their hands upon them
[56:01] and they began and they all received the
[56:04] Holy Ghost so so God's not just got one
[56:07] little in in a little box amen God can
[56:09] fill you with the Holy Ghost I remember
[56:11] one night I was I was um I was just
[56:14] preaching I was just a kid and and I was
[56:16] just preaching away and there was this
[56:17] boy that wanted the Holy Ghost so bad
[56:19] and and um I knew enough about the
[56:22] message to know that not not to look for
[56:25] tongues amen that's that's not the
[56:27] evidence of the Holy Ghost and I I just
[56:28] told him you're going to know and and he
[56:30] would he would come and I just I need
[56:32] the Holy Ghost I said listen amen do I
[56:34] have it and I said well the the if if
[56:36] you're questioning then you probably
[56:37] don't so so just keep on just keep on
[56:40] praying it's going to come I don't know
[56:42] how I don't know when it's going to come
[56:44] and and I was up there just preaching
[56:46] away and then all of a sudden scared me
[56:48] to death he scared everybody to death he
[56:50] jumped up in the middle of the service
[56:52] he jumped up and he says I got it when
[56:56] I got it I've got the Holy Ghost and I'm
[56:59] here to tell you God forever more
[57:01] changed and it was Nathan it was my
[57:03] dad's little brother he was he was uh he
[57:06] was a year younger than me so amen uh he
[57:09] matter of fact he had a car wreck when
[57:10] he was 18 years old and um and he U he
[57:14] had just received the Holy Ghost two
[57:17] weeks uh three four weeks before uh
[57:21] before he had that Rank and I I'll never
[57:24] forget it amen it changed his total life
[57:28] amen he he he he just had it rough in
[57:31] life and tried alcohol and drugs and was
[57:34] this and that and just oh but when he
[57:36] wanted to when he when he got right with
[57:38] God he had to get baptized and had to
[57:40] get repented but I remember when he
[57:42] received the Holy Ghost now I tell you
[57:44] what that that that guy was he was so
[57:48] excited amen it he just messed the whole
[57:51] service up we couldn't we couldn't get
[57:53] him to shut up for nothing and Nathan
[57:55] was quiet he
[57:57] so it was quite a it was quite a a deal
[58:00] but when the power of God comes upon you
[58:03] amen it listen I I I believe in the
[58:05] power of God I welcome the power of God
[58:09] I want the power of God so let's look at

[59:13] fastening his eyes upon him with John
[59:16] said look upon us and he gave heed unto
[59:19] them expecting to receive something of
[59:21] them then Peter said silver and gold I
[59:25] have none but such as I have I give thee
[59:30] in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[59:33] rise up and walk and he took him by the
[59:36] right hand lifted him up and immediately
[59:39] his feet and ankle bones received
[59:41] strength and he leaping stood up and
[59:44] walked and entered with them into the
[59:46] temple walking and leaping and praising
[59:48] God and all the people saw him walking
[59:51] and praising God and they knew
[59:56] that it was he which set for arms at the
[59:59] beautiful gate of the temple and they
[1:00:02] were filled with wonder and amazement at
[1:00:05] that which happened unto him can you say
[1:00:09] amen amen now let's let's let's let's go
[1:00:12] over I want to I want us to look at the
[1:00:14] gifts of of uh discernment over here in
[1:00:17] in Acts 5 and
[1:00:19] one amen and um this is this is going to
[1:00:23] be a story of when when uh they were
[1:00:26] selling their homes and and and U uh and
[1:00:31] and bringing it in and and and they um
[1:00:36] each each person after they sold their
[1:00:38] homes they were to they they they were
[1:00:40] going to give as much there was I there
[1:00:42] was no requirement as what they had to
[1:00:44] give to the church but but um they um um
[1:00:49] but they would come in and they they
[1:00:51] were they were getting rid of everything
[1:00:52] they had because of the persecution and
[1:00:55] so I here ananas and surfaris had sold
[1:00:58] their home and so here let's let's just
[1:01:00] start here at the first verse fifth
[1:01:02] chapter but a certain man named ananas
[1:01:05] with Safara his wife sold a possession
[1:01:08] and kept part uh back part of the price
[1:01:12] and his wife also being privy to it uh
[1:01:15] and brought a certain part and laid it
[1:01:17] at the apostles feet but Peter said
[1:01:21] ananas why hast thou filled thine heart
[1:01:24] to lie to the Holy Ghost now this is
[1:01:28] discernment this is God Amen this is the
[1:01:32] gift of knowledge this is God showing
[1:01:35] the word of knowledge Amen to keep back
[1:01:39] part of the price of thy land whilst it
[1:01:43] remained uh was it not thine own after
[1:01:47] it was sold was it not thine in thine
[1:01:49] own power why hast thou concealed this
[1:01:53] thing in thine heart and th
[1:01:56] thou Hast not lied unto men but unto God
[1:02:00] and anas hearing these thing these words
[1:02:03] fell down and gave up The Ghost and
[1:02:07] great fear came on all them that heard
[1:02:10] these things could you imagine being in
[1:02:12] a
[1:02:12] church where people are dying because
[1:02:15] they're lying amen and the young men
[1:02:18] arose wound him up and carried him out
[1:02:21] and buried him and it was about the
[1:02:24] space of 3 hours after that when his
[1:02:26] wife not knowing what was done came in
[1:02:29] and Peter answered unto her tell me
[1:02:32] whether ye sowed the land for so much
[1:02:33] and she said yay for so much then Peter
[1:02:37] said unto her how is it that you have
[1:02:41] agreed together to tempt the spirit of
[1:02:44] the Lord behold the feet of them which
[1:02:46] have buried thy husband are at the door
[1:02:48] and shall carry thee out and then she
[1:02:51] fell down straightway at his feet and
[1:02:54] yielded up the ghost
[1:02:56] and the young men came in and found her
[1:02:58] dead carrying carrying her forth buried
[1:03:01] her with her husband and great fear come
[1:03:05] upon all the church and upon as many as
[1:03:09] heard them can you say Amen now now
[1:03:12] brother brandham says what you you'll
[1:03:14] you'll see this over and over throughout
[1:03:16] the message he says Satan don't want the
[1:03:19] gifts in the
[1:03:20] church because the the gifts keep the
[1:03:24] church clean
[1:03:28] so so the gifts are for our edification
[1:03:31] but gifts are not there just to make
[1:03:33] things but gifts are there Amen to to to
[1:03:37] bring out sin gifts are there to Amen to
[1:03:41] cause fear upon the church to say listen
[1:03:45] amen not to follow a man not to follow a
[1:03:47] pastor not to follow uh uh even even uh
[1:03:52] brother brandham but to follow that word
[1:03:56] because we're not it's not we we we're
[1:03:58] not we we want you you know people
[1:04:01] people term us as bramit as if we're
[1:04:04] following a personality we're not
[1:04:07] following a personality we're following
[1:04:10] the
[1:04:12] word and so when we hear the word now
[1:04:16] there's many that are following the
[1:04:18] personality amen they're following the
[1:04:21] personality there's a lot of people that
[1:04:23] are deceived and are simply following a
[1:04:26] personality and how do I know this is
[1:04:28] because they're not giving themselves to
[1:04:31] the word that the prophet brought
[1:04:34] they're happy and content to say amen I
[1:04:38] I I'm a message believer I believe
[1:04:40] brother brandom is a prophet that is
[1:04:42] wonderful that you you can do that all
[1:04:44] you want to but if it's not LED you back
[1:04:47] to a burning deep down desire to please
[1:04:52] the Lord that I'm sorry you're following
[1:04:55] a
[1:04:58] personality the this holy spirit is
[1:05:01] living and that word must live in us can

[1:12:22] that was the power and the glory of that
[1:12:25] first church amen amen I I you know you
[1:12:30] you um you think about Paul's
[1:12:33] conversion amen uh uh they're the
[1:12:35] Apostle Paul did you know that it was
[1:12:38] just a common believer ananas matters of
[1:12:41] fact you want to read let's just read
[1:12:42] over there real quickly to 10 uh page or
[1:12:46] chapter 10 and um we'll look here at the
[1:12:50] 39th verse I believe it
[1:12:53] is praise the Lord Lord
[1:12:58] maybe
[1:13:00] amen you know what I don't I don't have
[1:13:04] that I have 10 to 17 but I didn't I
[1:13:07] didn't put the chapter
[1:13:11] down praise the Lord you love
[1:13:14] him amen okay yeah yeah so we're at the
[1:13:18] ninth chapter all right so so Paul the
[1:13:22] Apostle Paul the one who wrote the New
[1:13:24] Testament
[1:13:25] he was now he was one that that was out
[1:13:29] to kill the Apostle Paul was the one
[1:13:32] that young man that they said that held
[1:13:33] the coat of the guys who were stoning
[1:13:35] Steven to death that was the Apostle
[1:13:37] Paul he was a bad man this guy this guy
[1:13:41] was the chief in the in in the in the
[1:13:43] Jewish religion and his mission was to
[1:13:47] kill all of the Christians that he could
[1:13:50] kill well and um but yet God had another
[1:13:55] plan for Saul and though Saul as evil of
[1:14:00] a man as he was he had a heart that
[1:14:03] really wanted to please the Lord and so
[1:14:08] uh he thought that he was doing doing
[1:14:11] God a good thing by killing people that
[1:14:13] that disagree with with his religion and
[1:14:16] so the the the light shines on Paul
[1:14:20] knocks him off his horse blinds the
[1:14:23] blinds Saul and so let's read let's just
[1:14:26] read here
[1:14:27] um and so uh
[1:14:31] uh he he was he was blind and and uh uh
[1:14:37] uh we we so uh on the eth verse and Saul

[1:14:45] 998 and when his eyes were open he saw
[1:14:47] no man's but they led him by the hand
[1:14:49] and brought him to Damascus and he was
[1:14:51] three days without sight neither did he
[1:14:54] eat or drink
[1:14:55] and there was a certain disciple at
[1:14:58] Damascus named ananas to him said the
[1:15:01] Lord in a vision ananas he said behold I
[1:15:06] am here Lord and the Lord said unto him
[1:15:09] arise go into the street which is called
[1:15:12] straight and inquire of the House of

[1:15:23] vision uh an uh a man named ananas
[1:15:27] coming in and putting his hand on him
[1:15:30] that he might receive his sight then
[1:15:32] ananas answered and said Lord I have
[1:15:35] heard by many of this man how much evil
[1:15:39] he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem
[1:15:42] and here he has Authority from the chief
[1:15:44] priest to bind all that call on thy name
[1:15:47] but the Lord said unto him go thy way
[1:15:50] for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[1:15:53] Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[1:15:56] Kings and the children of Israel and I

[1:16:01] show him how great things he must suffer
[1:16:04] for my name's sake and ananas went and
[1:16:08] ananas went his way and entered into the
[1:16:10] house putting his hands on him and said
[1:16:13] brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that
[1:16:16] appeared unto thee in the way as thou
[1:16:19] camest hath sent me that thou mightest
[1:16:22] receive thy sight and be filled with the
[1:16:24] Holy GH ghost and immediately there fell

[1:16:49] do you understand do do you see the
[1:16:52] beauty the glory of the Lord in the
[1:16:55] church we that's is what we want in the
[1:16:59] church and if you kids haven't read the
[1:17:01] book of Acts I'd encourage you to read
[1:17:02] the book of Acts amen uh uh all of us
[1:17:06] should should go back and refresh
[1:17:07] ourselves with the book of Acts because
[1:17:09] it it is quite a amen it it it's quite a
[1:17:12] deal the the power of God was up on
[1:17:15] those men to preach the gospel to live
[1:17:18] the gospel amen the power of God was
[1:17:22] with them they but they dedicated their
[1:17:25] lives to that gospel now I want I want
[1:17:28] us to just really think here as as we as
[1:17:31] I'm not going to keep you long tonight
[1:17:33] when we think about the Gospel of Jesus
[1:17:36] Christ the church world today has made
[1:17:39] this until it's just um just making good
[1:17:44] nice little families and making uh and
[1:17:47] and and we you know we just become just
[1:17:50] church members church goers we just
[1:17:55] become good good members of society but
[1:17:59] that's not I mean it is God's God's
[1:18:01] bringing us together to be good families
[1:18:04] and things of that nature but but but
[1:18:07] we're not here to just be trained to
[1:18:09] train good
[1:18:11] families we want we we are here under
[1:18:15] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:19] and God has anointed us to preach the
[1:18:21] gospel set the captives free he's
[1:18:25] anointed us amen so so that the gifts of
[1:18:28] the Spirit can flow through US manifest
[1:18:31] himself through us just like he done in
[1:18:34] the Old Testament Church can you say
[1:18:36] amen I mean I mean there they they're
[1:18:38] you know the uh uh there there was there
[1:18:41] in Acts 13 you know the Apostle Paul was
[1:18:44] over there trying to preach and there's
[1:18:45] this guy this false prophet you know
[1:18:48] that was that that was over there he was
[1:18:50] prophesying and and and actually saying
[1:18:52] some good things about the about Paul
[1:18:54] and uh but but but finally Paul you know
[1:18:56] he just had enough of it and and the
[1:18:59] Bible says he turns right around and
[1:19:00] says he says uh I smite you blind you're
[1:19:04] going to be blind for uh for a while
[1:19:07] until you get your evil heart repented
[1:19:08] of and immediately the guy was blind and
[1:19:12] the Bible says that all of everyone in
[1:19:15] the city everyone feared
[1:19:18] God everyone begin to fear and to think
[1:19:23] why because God was living in vessels in
[1:19:27] that City can you say amen amen so so
[1:19:32] you know um Aunt Angie had asked about
[1:19:34] prophecy here a while back and and uh um
[1:19:37] sister sister uh Mary had had had me you
[1:19:42] know asked about the woman's um part too
[1:19:44] and um and and for
[1:19:46] you uh for you ladies
[1:19:50] um that the scriptures say I got to
[1:19:52] thinking about this and I have there's
[1:19:53] three things in the book of there
[1:19:55] there's three things in the New
[1:19:56] Testament acts 2:16 it says your sons
[1:19:59] and your daughters shall prophesy sons
[1:20:02] and your daughters shall prophesy acts
[1:20:04] 21 and9 we we can just turn there real
[1:20:07] quickly before we dismiss here tonight
[1:20:10] amen acts
[1:20:12] 21 and um let's see the eth verse and
[1:20:16] the next day that uh the next day that
[1:20:22] we were of Paul's company Departed and
[1:20:24] came into cesaria and we entered into
[1:20:27] the house of Philip the Evangelist which
[1:20:29] was one of the seven and Abode with him
[1:20:32] and the same man had four daughters
[1:20:35] virgins which did prophesy so so there
[1:20:40] were there were prophecies and then of
[1:20:43] course the Apostle Paul comes in in 1
[1:20:45] Corinthians the 11th chapter and and the
[1:20:48] fifth verse is every woman who prays or
[1:20:51] prophesies having her head uncovered
[1:20:55] dishonor her head and so prophecy is is
[1:21:00] is is something that is that is that is
[1:21:02] meant for the man and the woman it's
[1:21:04] part of it it's not it's it's not
[1:21:07] teaching it's not of anything of that
[1:21:09] nature there so God can use God can use
[1:21:12] you girls in Prophecy God can use you
[1:21:17] you you boys in Prophecy he can use
[1:21:20] mamas and daddies in any of those nine
[1:21:22] spiritual gifts I I I I think you know
[1:21:26] as as as I was asked
[1:21:28] here uh you know it's been a little
[1:21:30] while ago and and and and you know
[1:21:32] brother PR had asked me you know
[1:21:35] why why don't we see more of it where
[1:21:40] amen and and and my my thoughts were
[1:21:43] pretty simple on it I said we don't
[1:21:46] desire
[1:21:48] it we've got too many other things that
[1:21:52] we're most most people are just happy
[1:21:55] just coming to church and and and and no
[1:21:58] don't even think about the ministry
[1:22:00] aspect of it and and um and so we we we
[1:22:05] don't we don't travail and and get into
[1:22:07] that place with God to where God can uh
[1:22:11] uh move upon us but I I that word there
[1:22:15] if you look there in the Greek word
[1:22:16] where he says uh you know to desire
[1:22:19] desire you know uh desire to prophesy or
[1:22:22] whatever that that word desire comes
[1:22:24] comes uh from the Greek word zeu and and
[1:22:27] it means to burn with a Zeal to deep be
[1:22:31] deeply committed to something to settle
[1:22:33] one's heart and to be completely intent
[1:22:37] on so so what the Apostle Paul was
[1:22:39] saying is hey you know and I I've got a
[1:22:42] lot more of these scriptures here that
[1:22:43] we could we could go through and um but
[1:22:47] but the the the the thing is is is
[1:22:51] remember we got to remember what our day
[1:22:54] is our day is
[1:22:57] lukewarmness how many knows what
[1:22:58] lukewarmness is how how many you girls
[1:23:00] what what does lukewarm
[1:23:08] mean that's right not hot or cold you
[1:23:11] amen you drink your coffee hot or cold
[1:23:15] amen according to the War
[1:23:17] Room not supposed to drink it amen uh
[1:23:21] lukewarm so so we we want we we don't
[1:23:25] want to be
[1:23:26] lukewarm you know there ain't going to
[1:23:29] be no girls marry you girl boys if if
[1:23:31] you're lukewarm about the
[1:23:33] relationship there there's not going to
[1:23:34] be you're not going to succeed in your
[1:23:36] job on your job if it's you're just
[1:23:39] lukewarm about it you you're not you're
[1:23:41] not going to be promoted you're not

[1:23:47] there to do is to get you a paycheck and
[1:23:49] you're just doing the minimal just to
[1:23:51] keep from getting fired well you know
[1:23:53] that's that's that's okay I guess but if

[1:24:10] money and I promise you you're going to

[1:24:19] just barely making an end and you're
[1:24:21] just barely doing the bare minimum and
