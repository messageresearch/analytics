here in the book of Zechariah 14 and then uh we're going to read uh nine verses here amen and it says behold the day of the Lord cometh and thy SPO shall be divided in the midst of thee for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses riffled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the peoples shall be cut off uh shall not be cut off from the city then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations when he fought as when he fought in the day of battle and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the East and toward the west and there shall be a great valley and half of the mountain shall be uh shall remove toward the North and half toward the South and ye shall flee to the Valley of the mountains for the Valley of the mountains shall reach unto AAL yay ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the Lord my God shall come and all the saints with thee and it shall come come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day uh which the shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall not but it shall come to pass at the evening time it shall be light and it shall be in that day that Living Waters shall come shall go forth come out uh from Jerusalem half of them toward the former sea and half of them toward the hinder sea in the in summer and in the winter shall it be and the Lord shall be king over all the Earth and that day shall there be one Lord and his name one let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your blessings to us thank you Lord for always being good to us Lord we are IM mortal people and how fickle we are Lord you said that the young men shall be weary and the old men shall faint Lord but Lord they that wait upon you shall renew their strength and father we look to you we lord in our bodies as we uh find that we're not immune from uh sicknesses and and Lord uh mishaps and but Lord You Are one who is our healer and we thank you for that be with sister Angie tonight Lord as she is recovering from her procedures Lord I pray that you'll be with all of those Lord who are struggling tonight brother Dylan there with his knee and but God we're looking to you and looking for a a body that will not Decay that's a promise you've given us and that's why we come to these services and that's why we rally around your word and Brotherhood and father we're asking that you will be with us tonight and you will speak your word to us and let us really grasp what the spirit is saying to the church in this hour and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated praise the Lord amen so we we uh we definitely love the Lord and um we're so thankful for his his great power and um there was something I was wanting to read to the church and amen I lost my spot here hallelujah and um amen we um I want to speak tonight on the message of confirmation and we have received a message of confirmation and um in in this world where where Darkness abounds and we we see the darkness that that is upon the church world Amen but it's not you know it's not just I mean it's the world period and we can see the scripture quickly coming to pass where all the nations of the earth amen are turning on Israel as Israel is is fighting for her very existence amen evil-hearted men are anointed amen of the devil to come against Israel and we know that the scripture says that the whole world that Israel will end up fighting will stand alone and the every nation of the earth will turn on her and and we can see scripture coming to pass so quickly as the world Amen is turning its back and even Biden under political pressure I Biden in an interview the other day was saying that you know they were asking him well do you think that that uh uh the Prime Minister over there uh um Yahoo is don't don't you think that he's he's doing this for political gain and he said why of course it's it's all politics amen and and um of course he he he they they they started walking it back a day or two later as as the other said now listen who's who's playing politics here you were on Israel's side just a few months ago and because your base is is uh you're wanting to get reelected now you're you're turning Israel's fighting for her life amen we we they they have Nations all around them that are vowing to kill Israel and to annihilate the Jews there there are people in America that are walking around amen with signs that says kill the Jews we we have got this all over the world Amen where where the the world is turning against Israel but yet as we read here in this scripture amen when the day of the Lord comes and that there was this was going to to take place and amen but we also know that when the world when the world all turns on Israel amen that Christ was going to come and with him will be the Saints to fight for Israel do you see how close close we are can can you can you see amen when you see these kinds of things taking place because remember what Jesus said when you see the budding of that fig tree then you lift up your head because Redemption is coming nigh you you look at that and so Israel in 1948 amen become a nation and as as as as she all come back and that fig tree uh uh miraculously begin to bloom there in the midst of her enemies amen now as we a as we think about this I I've thought about World War I and and how amen uh Stalin and and Hitler and musolini and and and these guys had vowed to destroy Israel amen and and they killed 6 million Jews and and the war was going and and listen there wasn't very many Jews left amen and and if there was there were Evil Hearted men and and they were the ring leaders but there were amen there were there were thousands and thousands and thousands that were anointed of the devil to fulfill their evil desires amen and yet when we we we found that all of a sudden amen why did that world war stop amen why didn't they annihilate the Jews is because prophecy said there in Revelation 7 that that it says and after these things I saw the Four Angels standing on the four corners of the earth uh holding the Four Winds of the earth that that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice Amen to the four angels to whom it was given given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants amen now this is the Jews this is not the bride amen of our God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel amen and the prophet would teach us he would say now amen the the what calls this the anointing upon the Earth was already here to kill the Jews but God stepped forward and say whoa hold back I've got to seal 144,000 amen 12,000 of of of of each tribe amen and I I I I I've got to make sure that they are sealed before uh this great uh battle begins to take place they were ready to go but he said you wait until amen now if the 144,000 weren't on the earth amen there there there had to amen there had to be some Jews and and and God knows those elected Jews and so I you know amen I I'm here to tell you there the elect is there now there's the Servants of God can you say amen amen that God is going to seal with the Holy Ghost and amen and and of course the bride is going to be gone during this time when whenever uh the the the spirit of the Lord lifts from the earth and takes away the bride amen there will be the two prophets that come and preaches to them amen preach the same gospel that you've got they'll receive the same holy ghost that you receive amen and and then we it's it's a it's a great it's a great plan amen it's a great thing and and I'm here to tell you what is taking place right now Israel who is a very wealthy Nation Israel who leads in in the world in a in in a lot of areas amen is in uh in in in agriculture or not not agriculture but amen they they've got great business out of Israel amen and and but we're finding that there Israel is beginning to really call upon the name of the lord they're they're beginning to really begin to say listen amen we've got to get serious they are getting hit from from every direction amen I if you if you looked at you know what has taken place yesterday and the day before I mean uh that their fields are burning their houses are burning where they're where they're throwing these rockets in from the other side now and amen and and they're trying to keep the fires up they're getting hit from all around but Israel is beginning to cry unto God and beginning to ask the Lord amen we need your help and I'm here to tell you that what God's always loved Israel God has always loved Israel amen and I and at the same time we know if God is beginning to turn to Israel amen then the days of the Gentiles are now over the days of the Gentiles is getting close amen and you can tell it you can see because the seeds that Lucifer planted amen uh uh you know years ago amen 2,000 years ago 1500 years ago Amen in the church that early church and amen have now become great trees and the anti christ is totally rooted Amen in Christendom and and the great has influenced the whole earth we are setting Amen in Prophecy the stage is set for the coming of the Lord amen the stage is set for the Great Tribulation the T the stage is set amen for God to reveal himself to the Jews I'm here to tell you you we're living in an incredible time now all of this is taking place amen and while this is taking place the church has totally dismissed the word of God they have walked away from the word of God because they have been taught by that woman Jezebel aen who has offered things and idols and the a the Antichrist spirit is now the head of the the nominal church and brother brandom would say there amen uh in the in in the first or in the uh 125 of your books and and the very last uh uh paragraph he says when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything it is like Eve when Cain was born she said I gotten a man from the Lord amen now do you realize that she really meant that she thought that she had a man from the Lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God she then thought that what ever she said was right if she said she had a man from God then she had a man from God but God has set laws in his Universe a good seed can only bring forth good fruit an evil seed can only bring forth evil fruit can you say Amen so we can understand that Satan amen by his desire has sown his seeds into the womb of the church amen and literally millions and millions millions and millions of of the inhabitants of this Earth amen has is is has taken amen and swallowed his amen and taken the mark of that beast and and and you can see that when they have taken that Mark of that Beast amen the scripture says that they are sealed unto death amen there's no way now when let let me just say it this way when the angel of death strikes amen you may still will be living in your natural body but you have no way to discern good and evil you have no way your your conscience is seared it is numbed you can no longer amen see things as truth amen as good and evil you are you your your soul has been killed brother I want to tell you what you're seeing around here in the transgender movement and all of these things and you're looking at these people and you're thinking what kind of politics and what kind of plan I look at them and I know the word looks at them and said that the death angel has struck their amen their hearts and their minds the Apostle Paul says she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she lives amen they have taken the mark of the beast amen they have been sealed the death angel is striking well can you say Amen you remember back in Egypt amen it says apply the blood if you don't have the blood applied the death angel is going to strike that home amen and I that's the reason why Amen in this church amen right here in Pony oh God never let the death angel strike any home amen of our congregation never let the powers amen of of of of Satan amen begin to come in now remember how are you going to know amen that you've got that blood applied you were to take that Bloody lamb amen you were to kill that lamb you were to apply the blood and you were to eat the lamb and I'm here to tell you it was the word that was made flesh that hung on Calvary that we have applied to our heart and it's the word of God that we are eating and we're feasting on every word of God when you're feasting on the word of God Satan has no hold when you're feasting on the word of of God Amen your conscience cannot be touched by the enemy oh can you say amen I say tonight God if there's ever been a time for the church amen to get serious and understand that I'm in a predestinated time and that I'm part amen of the rapturing generation I believe we are here right now can you say amen amen that's right yes sir amen Jesus with saying in Matthew 10 and 28 amen it says fear not them which can kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to both uh to to destroy both the soul and Body in hell and I and I want to say Amen when the death angel strikes you brother you're gone amen you have no way to discern good and evil anymore you have no way amen perhaps many have been given the chance perhaps many many heard the preachers perhaps many have have heard the message of the hour but because they rejected that now they stand Amen in death well can you say amen and what is it they are marked or they are sealed unto the second death amen and it is a very fearful thing amen there is no hope when you spurn the mercy of God can you say Amen now are you hearing me you see the mark of the beast is the mark of apostasy and it's there to try to amen it's the Antichrist Spirit to putting his seal upon his own people now brother Brandon would simply say the Ardon sin is to disbelieve or reject the Vindicated word of God Amen there there in Matthew 12 and and 31 amen it would say Amen Jesus would say wherefore I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world or in the world to come can you say amen Amen brother Brandon would say Amen the first thing you know he says you may act ever so religious but your ears are sealed to the truth truth you remember when they when they you they would be so close till it would deceive the very elect to reject the gospel is to be sealed with the mark of the beast God marks you now what does it mean amen uh it was in in your head your ears in your head too what is it your head is the knowledge faith comes by hearing hearing um not some church rule but the word of God Amen First Timothy 4:1 it says now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils and and speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron now what is that seared mean it means to mark it is to Brand amen what do you do with a W with a cow and you want everyone to know amen who they are what they are who they belong to amen you take a branding iron amen you get it hot Amen in the fire and then you brand that cow and then everyone knows what brand it belongs to and so the devil has branded his own and I'm here to tell you amen it's a brand amen it's lawlessness amen it's it's anti- it's my own thinking it's my own opinion it's my well can you say Amen but if that if the devil's got a mark so does God have a mark he has a seal he says he knows his own and let everyone that names the name of the Lord let them depart from iniquity amen so God's got his seal amen what is that seal it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and I want to tell you brother if you don't have the Holy Ghost you must get the Holy Ghost the life of the blood must be upon your heart's door can I hear an amen this is where we are the stage is at how how are how how are people so prone to to all of the junk that is out there and you and I can look at him and say what is going on what is going on Hallelujah they're seared they're branded what what would cause all that Middle East to do that and then all of these nations to hold n Yahoo accountable and saying that he's a war criminal have they forgot amen that these guys are have have have have uh you know they the babies were beheaded and they were burnt alive and amen they uh uh they they they they were fing amen they with their GoPro cameras filming what they were doing to those israels amen when they beautifully killed all of those 1300 people amen these guys have become insane amen they've got the mark of the beast think got them what is the Beast what is the Beast it's that very beast in the beginning that came unto Amen to Eve and she listened to just one word that he had to say and it's brought death and destruction and and broken homes amen and defilement to the Earth it's that same Mark that is now upon the hearts of Satan's Children and they're trying amen and I'm here to tell you friend this world Amen is not even fit for a human being hard to live in anymore but I've got an assurance it is time to go home it is time to go home if there's ever a time to say God I need your seal upon my heart don't let the devil Mark me with his seal of I don't care can you say am man amen to disbelieve now you say that was a that was a natural blood over the door God's not requiring the physical blood of Jesus Christ the physical blood of Jesus Christ is in the ground amen you wouldn't find a bit of it a trace of it hallelujah amen so what is it the life of that innocent lamb must come back upon you and God knows and the world knows where what life is in You by the life you live the way you dress the way you talk the way you love the Lord Lord you know what life is in you oh but Qui can you say Amen your life is the door amen what kind of a life the angel the world the neighbor had to see they could see the blood over the doorpost amen up over the door and and upon the doorpost can you say amen and the life of Jesus Christ will be so exhibited that there will never be anyone that can ever question who you are Hallelujah now you say well I've got the holy I must have the Holy Ghost because I don't think like those guys think I'm here to tell you Satan's out there to take every one of you innocent ones he's there to take every church member amen and if he can get you to be content if he can get you to be content without the baptism of the Holy Ghost only those who do not have the Seal of God will not receive the death of the death angel come on church amen so don't sit in a church building and say well amen I I don't I I I'm I'm a pretty good guy and I'm still thinking right so I must have the Holy Ghost amen I want to tell you there's only one way that you are going to be amen free from the devil and all of the onslaughts that's on this world and that's to receive a new birth inside your soul can you say Amen now cuz the random says you'll act ever so religious but your ears will be sealed Hallelujah you say well well you know a little little little this and a little that and a little this it was just a little of one thing for Eve brother random says she just broke one word come on now well it don't matter what I dress it don't matter what I you know I heard someone say you know I preached on lipstick here a while back and talking or or I I think about the clear stuff or something well it don't matter on that you you you're missing the you you you miss the spirit amen and it might have been somewhere else but here but someone someone had asked me about it and I I said you're you're missing the point amen you're missing what what the what the pro what the spirit of God through the prophet was trying to say amen and if you're going to sit there and just dissect everything the prophet said instead of just coming in and say God take me 100% I don't want to be stress battling the fence the token must be applied Israel is fighting for her life what we just read is that Christ and his Saints are going to come back to fight for her what I'm saying is is between now and then there must be a Rapture take place I believe with all of my heart we are near the Fulfillment of that scripture I believe with all of my heart when you receive if if you've listened to the message at all when you receive into your worm womb anything contrary to the word you are finished it seals you away your mind is sealed with a hot iron you are branded you remember amen uh the the the the the Old Testament amen the slave when it was time for the Year of Jubilee would come and the trumpet of Jubilee would sound and all of the slaves were going back home it was given amen if that slave did not want to be free from its master and he wanted to stay there amen with with his uh amen with with his slave owner they would take him down to Amen to to to the to the center of the community and they're to a to a post and they would bore a heart oh in his ear amen and they would and that it would be forever more that that man or that woman would be a slave to that slave owner for the rest of his life he could never more Go free brother bradam says why was it the year is because you can no longer hear the word of God and believe it now you're saying oh I believe it this way I believe you can never hear it pure and true anymore why because your

everything you've got it's time for the word of God to be our absolute I don't want to be sealed away from the kingdom of God when the church gets away from the word she believes anything why because she went outside God's protective boundaries and substituted his word for her opinions can you say Amen but before this great day of the Lord before this ruination the tribulation before in this within this same season if you would go back and look at it in this in this time that's not day or night in this season where it's not sin and righteousness now it's just a big conglomeration of we

ranked Sinners amen hallelujah they're not Sinners they're good people good people they're good people but they'll never be able to accept the word of God that has been given to us in this generation good people but they'll never be able to receive this message of confirmation God sent a profit to us to point us back and say now listen here's your tie poost here's your signs look at Israel keep your eyes and when you start seeing these things temp lift up now remember he would say remember remember get ready it's time to go they won't be able to get their garments ready can you say Amen Jesus says Matthew 24:24 we've heard it so many times but there shall arise false christs and false prophets the message of confirmation says now listen this is the way it goes they're going to have the genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost it it's going to be but they're going to be false teachers so these are going to be anointed ones anointed OED to preach anointed to sing anointed until it would deceive the very elected if it was possible but it's not possible because I'm want to send you a message to confirm the genetics the seed of God on the inside of you can you say Amen oh Hallelujah because you remember amen what did the scripture say Ephesians 5: 26 that he might sanctify somebody say sanctify and cleanse it the church me and you with the washing of Water by what word the message of confirmation you said now that didn't say that yes God sent us Malachi 4 to point that's back to that word amen with signs and wonders so you can look at that word and say it is confirmed in my heart I know where I stand when the death angel is striking and everyone else is looking at me saying you're cuckoo and they're looking at me straight in the eye and you're thinking are you joking are you not do you believe what you're saying or do you not yeah they believe what they're saying yes their minds are so modled until the truth is no longer there but he says he's going to sanctify and cleanse you with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present to himself a glorious Church oh can you say Amen not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish you mean I can be holy in this crazy godforsaken world I can go without any blemish in this crazy godforsaken world Amen I say yes you can just believe the word I've

with everything you've got it'll stand for you GL stand for that word that word that blood will stand for you in your time of weakness can you say amen the message is not a new message the message is a message of confirmation to this elect saying that what has been written is yours and it's good for Rapture it wasn't time for them back then but it is time now so therefore I'm going to send a prophet and he's going to say you better get your garments white you better start what you better take every word of God don't you fall like all of those others have right this is your season this message is the coming of the Lord this message is the shout the proclamation what is this message the Bible says that at the Midnight Cry at the midnight time there was a cry that came forth and behold the bridegroom cometh Make Ready amen and the five foolish didn't have oil in their lamb and went out into outer Darkness the Great Tribulation but the Five Wives had oil but they let them go out so it took the prophet message saying get ready trim the scripture says trim your lamps they had the oil but they had to start lining themselves up well come on Church don't sit there don't you

our lamps the bridegroom is coming Hallelujah when we see what was going on Amen Hallelujah some say well I've got I've got the Holy Ghost amen I don't have to believe the message I've got the Holy Ghost how can you have the Holy Ghost and not receive the message of confirmation behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he's going to turn your hearts back to the Bible Hallelujah there's no Rapture outside this word this word is the only thing that can make you clean and whole oh come on now that's why we don't argue with the word we say God thank you for the boundaries of the word in fact we say thank you for the garments of the word the scripture says amen that that the bride had white reignment which is the righteousness of the Saints the scripture Apostle Paul says I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God un salvation amen righteousness comes through that word and that word it's got plenty of blood it's got plenty it's got plenty of detergent for your stains amen but you're going to have to say okay I I'm going to bow to the word and say it is your place not mine amen Wash Me cleanse me make me what you want me to be take the sins away take my garments away take anything that is impure away let me walk with you can you say Amen you say well someone told me here some time back well man it must be hard keeping everybody on the straight and narrow at your church man you you can you well I don't know how you do it but they don't wear pants the women don't wear pants and the guys ain't drinking and boy even when we try man they uhuh they I looked at him with a smile and said are you kidding my Jesus said my sheep know my voice place and another they will not follow I'm Not Jesus all I'm here to do is feed the word and whatever's on the inside of them will come out of them Oh Glory to oh can you say Amen it's not by your works now it's not by your works but I'm here to tell you you ain't going to be a rattlesnake and a lamb at the same time amen thankful for the shepherd this message of confirmation can I be clean can I be pure can I walk with God amen Amen brother Wendell I want to know what's the Holy Ghost given for well the prophet of God says it's a seal brother brandom says it's a comforter amen it's a teacher is that right hallelujah amen he he says in Mary's belief he says except a man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of God now see means understand there's a l lot of people says that they're born again and can't understand the message of God can't see the angel of God their eyes are blinded brother except a man be born of the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that wrote the word will confirm the word and the same confirmation of the Holy Ghost in you you see what I mean it will bear record of itself brother the message of confirmation has come and shown light upon on this word it is open that word up to you and to me so that we can have a clear understanding where we came from where we're going and when you see these things happen lift up your head for Redemption is drawing nigh unto you what the what what did 1 Corinthians 1 and8 I think it's 1 Corinthians 1 and8 sister Keys amen where it says he will confirm you unto the end who shall also confirm you until the end that you may be what blameless how can I be blameless in this sinful world just follow that word and just remember wherever you go wherever that word is there is plenty of blood wherever that word is there's plenty of Mercy wherever that word oh my brother when I fell yesterday wherever that word is if that word is your absolute there's going to be blood for you I wouldn't be following my opinions there's no blood for that I wouldn't be following amen well this one believes that well Dad believes this well Mama believes this I don't care what you believe follow that word it's got blood in it it's God's love for you but not only God's love for you but God's mercy for Israel the Gentiles and I'm closing the Gentiles through your faith and your love the Gentiles the bride of Christ because well praise the Lord okay so you women who who sew and you take the you you take a garment or you don't take a garment you take fabric amen have have you guys ever seen how these women make their clothes your fabric fabric is just this is this you take this stuff and you and you roll huh cloth cloth and you and you well fabric cloth anyways cloth so so you take this out and it's just one big piece of whatever and then they take the pattern of whatever dress they want to make whatever it's going to be and they'll they cut that pattern out now do you ladies throw away the remnant sister Carol says I don't y'all y'all throw away all of the other piece or y'all keep it for oh please don't please don't tell me you throw it away amen it's going to break my type amen The Remnant the the peace the product the dress is the bride that's what God was wanting Hallelujah but he's not going to throw the rest of it away because Israel was part of that too now they're not the bride they are the remnant they they are are are does God not love Israel now God loves his bride but God loves Israel the message the gospel came through Israel to get to you it was the Seed of Abraham and all the lineages and all the way going down through Jesus Christ but the Apostle Paul says the Seed of Abraham was Jesus Christ and if you want to be the Seed of Abraham you've got to come through the spirit of Jesus Christ and you are the Seed of Abraham are are you understand in other words God took the natural lineage to bring forth you and me the bride he's not going to throw away the natural seed he's not going to throw away Israel he's going to fight for Israel Israel has got a very special place in his mind can you say amen I believe that in this end time as we prepare for the coming of the Lord and we see Israel in the natural that these demons are fighting wicked men that are trying to kill Israel the prophet of God would tell us those 200,000,000 Horsemen were demons and yes while they're trying to afflict Israel he says I want to tell tell you the real purpose is to get to the woman's seed is to get to the Bride of Jesus Christ why has Satan hated Israel so bad is because she produced the anointed one she was God's people Satan what you're seeing over there in the natural I want you to understand God is allowing what what you're seeing there in those natural guns natural missiles natural beheadings natural evil men is happening in the spiritual realm and they want to kill you I'm going back and I'm reverting back all the way to my beginning of the message that death angels are there with their guns pointed to you and the only way you will ever be secure is standing behind amen The Fortress of the word and being filled with the life of the Holy Ghost you'll never withstand that evil you cannot do it and just as Israel I believe what wasn't it nyaho that that that gave that that that that that gave the land for peace all of these many years ago well amen gave the land for peace and said all right we'll give you just leave us alone we'll give you this land gave them that gssa strip gave that to him amen before is the it was they they wouldn't allow wouldn't even allow them to even get get get come into that Gaza area that way they wouldn't be able to come in and and and and and and Lodge Rockets over at them but they said land for peace amen so they let the enemy just move right next door and there's just one little fence in between them well they broke through the fence and they've been doing this they've been doing this for years years and years and years and years these guys have been doing this to Israel for bukus of years huh digging tunnels digging tunnels under Israel dig yeah doing all of this kind but finally finally somebody said enough is enough and we're not just going to come in and push you back out but we're going to destroy you well I don't know I I I don't know if they're going to destroy him I don't see them destroying them because you and I got to come back and even the score settle the score but those Devils that come in and they fight me and you and they work on us and they're they're they're they're oh how they're how how how those demons are are vicious I say God give us that determination that Israel's got right now that says I don't care if it hair lips the devil and every other denomination and every other church member or whatever else I am going to defeat you [Applause] devil come on I'm going to defeat you you might be you you might have got me yesterday you might be fighting my family you might be amen battling uh Dylan's knee and doing this these are demons that are out to to sideline you from your purpose but don't you ever forget that message that God's given you can you say Amen well glory to God so when we look to these things amen as I and and and and and I've got a lot more I could say but but why did God give us that word is because the word is the only thing it's our defense but it's also our weapon the word is not just our defense but you take the sword of the spirit Hallelujah the Bible says that when Jesus does come he's riding on a white horse and when you and I come Amen on the white horses that there will be a sword coming out of his mouth it will be his word to destroy the wicked it will be the same message that you are receiving it'll be the words of Prophecy it'll be Vindicated words if that's going to work in the Millennium if that's going to work when if that's going to work then why not use those words now why not take that devil and whoop him when brother prandom was given the the the Revelation to the seals and and the the the lamb opened the book and gave it to the seventh angel and when it was given to the seventh angel that open book and they made a big deal about it the Bible says it was a closed book now it's an open book and then the Declaration was for the people to come and eat it you were going to take the words of the Living God which is a two-edged sword the scripture says his words is a sharper than a two-edged sword you were going to place it upon your mouth you were going to eat it you were going to speak it when brother brandom was questioning the vision and he's up there on the mountain and his has his hands up in the air says I don't know what that meant those seven angels coming down I don't I don't understand when he had his hands up in the air asking the Lord would you please show me a sword appears in his hand and he's scared of a sword and he's looking at it and he's wondering what's this mean he's well maybe the a K sword they night they knite people with it maybe maybe the Lord means my Ministry is fixing to uh uh uh uh ordain ministers or something and then all of a sudden across the Canyons the king sword but then down deep in his heart deep he says now now no one said this audibly but down in my heart it just came out that said fear not this is only the third pool then he turns around and says so I'm loyal I must be loyal to this message for this message is the third pool putting the pieces together now brother's putting all the pieces together sword third pool I must be loyal to this message this message is the third pull at the end of the opening of the seals he says I hope you've understood it this is the third pool this what I Pentecostals all going around got a bunch of Pentecostals in the message trying to make make it a Wheelchairs and and and blind eyes and in in in the in the little you know in the little building and we want to see great manifestations well the only way you're going to see great manifestations is to take the sword of the spirit and kill your Devils sure there's going to be great gratifications of the spirit it's going to take somebody taking the sword of God and saying I'm not letting you come any further I am tired of it I am sick of it you are defeated but it ain't a bunch of people trying to make up things and trying to prophesy and trying to run all over the building and trying to manufacture something no it's going to take a people who know their position and they believe that word with everything they've got then sickness sickness is not going to hold on them on anymore the Mind battles even if you're sick amen you're saying I am not going to speak anything contrary to that word I'm not going to believe anything contrary to that word I'm come on now when you're sick you're saying I am strong amen when you're weak amen you're rising up and saying I we refuse to believe anything but that word if it's going to work over there I say let's let it work right here can you say Amen let that word live it's a confirmation it's a confirmation that you are a son this message is a confirmation that you do belong in this day it's a confirmation that you are on track it's a confirmation saying don't be looking to the right or to the left you are exactly where you need to be it's a confirmation saying that scripture right there that scripture right there is you and it's me and you rising up and saying I will believe that with all of my heart if the musicians would come well Glory those prophetic words are too much for the unconverted Jesus said I have a lot of things I'd like to say to you but you can't bear it right now I want you to go to Jerusalem and I want you to stay there and when you're converted then I will bring to pass the things that have already been spoken I'll bring it to pass through [Music] you I I I I'm saying well it's not what I can manufacture it's just keep right on and believe it and brother if there's ever been a time for us to be so thankful for this message H I thank God

[Music] heart and I want to say God gave him convictions and God show [Music] what did the prophet say he says I'm I'm here to dress the bride if I can get her still long enough to dress the bride in

humble [Music] cry's our our [Music] you know I my message sort of took a turn from what I was the way that I thought that it would go but let me just give you the essence of what I was wanting to get to the word that you're believing the brandom says the water falls upon the non-elect like water on a Ducks back as the anointing comes upon them but it it it doesn't do much to it but it says but let it once strike that seed and Watch What Happens quickly something is there right now why it's a predestinated seed that's coming forth It's got to come when that light the gospel strikes it they get it the rest of them will just walk away get up and walk away it's not for them and and so he he he talks about that but then but then he says he says now [Music] um he says so potentially it's in there what is it it's the promised word before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative talking about the flesh that's that's what that will reflect the positive the word the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing did by Sarah when that old body that she had that first body had to be changed in order to produce a son and that body could could not do it this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the sun now he's saying that that word that you're receiving in your heart that that word that you're allowing the Holy Ghost to fall upon he says that new body is being formed around that word and when this body drops off that body will all will be all that is seen this this thing here will be laid aside but that word that new body will just be right around that nucleus that predestinated seed I thought that was beautiful confirming what you were at the very beginning the Rapture the Rapture then would truly confirm what you have been saying by faith all along you have been saying by faith I'm a Believer you have been been saying by faith and the devil has been right there the whole time battling you with sickness battling you with depression battling you there with but the Rapture will be the final confirmation it'll be the finally final declaration to Satan and all of his imps the seed was there all along you love that it was there all along God bless you now it's it's the Rapture ain't just you I mean you don't don't be waiting for the Rapture to have a confirmation but it'll be you it'll be a confirmation to the world to the devil to everyone else what you have been what you have been standing in faith on all along amen hallelujah I love it this whole body will give way and that new one will come God bless you amen love every one of you keep pressing on Amen let's sing that song as we as as we uh do just
