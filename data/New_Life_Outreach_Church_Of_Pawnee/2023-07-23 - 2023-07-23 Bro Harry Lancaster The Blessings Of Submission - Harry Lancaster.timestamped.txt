[36:03] you administer to each one right now
[36:04] Lord
[36:05] I lift before you
[36:07] sister Denise and brother Mike King Lord
[36:09] and and Joel in the hospital Lord Jesus
[36:13] Lord I I got the call from them earlier
[36:16] that Joel had begun to pass more blood

[36:58] the service into your hands Lord
[37:01] we just we want to hear from you
[37:04] we love you and we thank you Lord the
[37:06] name Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[37:09] you may have your seats
[37:12] I always feel uh
[37:15] I always feel a little bit bad for my
[37:17] Sunday school class when I'm called up
[37:19] to preach because I feel like they've
[37:21] gotten here the uh
[37:23] uh the trial version of the first
[37:25] version of most of my sermons through
[37:27] Sunday school
[37:29] um and then they just hear what take two
[37:32] or take three when I come up to preach
[37:37] but so
[37:39] headship uh according to the definition
[37:43] is the duty or function of watching or
[37:46] guarding for the sake of proper
[37:48] direction or control
[37:50] Authority is the power or right to give
[37:53] orders make decisions and enforce
[37:56] obedience
[37:58] let's turn to Colossians chapter one
[38:06] Colossians chapter 1 and verse 18.
[38:13] and he is the head of the body the
[38:15] church who is the beginning the
[38:17] firstborn from the dead that in all
[38:20] things he might have the preeminence
[38:24] preeminence our our pastor has been
[38:26] mentioning a few times in the Bible
[38:28] studies and preeminence is the fact of
[38:30] surpassing all others it is superiority
[38:34] and then let's turn to Hebrews chapter
[38:36] 13.
[38:41] Hebrews chapter 13.
[38:43] and verse 17.
[38:50] obey them that have the rule over you
[38:52] and submit yourselves
[38:55] for they watch for your souls as that as
[38:58] they that must give account that they
[39:00] may do it with joy and not with grief
[39:02] for that is unprofitable for you
[39:07] now
[39:08] a lot of times when we begin to talk
[39:10] about
[39:11] the ideas of headship and submission
[39:14] people immediately begin to get a little
[39:17] pull back a little bit begin to get a
[39:18] little bit defensive because the way
[39:21] that we think of headship and submission
[39:23] is very much colored by the society that
[39:27] we live in by the fact that we're a
[39:29] western mindset by the effect by the
[39:31] effect of the culture that's around us
[39:33] but if we just go back not even that far
[39:36] but just go back to the Middle Ages the
[39:38] idea of headship and submission were
[39:40] much more easily understood
[39:43] just looking through a little bit of
[39:45] History I found a couple things that I I
[39:47] found pretty interesting um written in
[39:49] uh in the use of law published
[39:52] posthumously in 1629 by Francis Bacon he
[39:56] wrote fealty is to take an oath upon a
[39:58] book that he will be a faithful tenant
[40:01] to the king
[40:03] in 11th century France
[40:07] um this was written on in uh on feudal
[40:10] obligations by the bishop folbert of
[40:13] charters
[40:14] in France he says ask to write something
[40:18] concerning the form of fealty I have
[40:21] noted briefly for you on the authority
[40:22] of the books the things which follow
[40:24] he who swears fealty to his Lord ought
[40:27] to always have these six things in
[40:29] memory
[40:30] what is harmless
[40:31] safe honorable
[40:33] useful easy practicable
[40:37] harmless that is to say that he should
[40:40] not be injurious to his Lord and his
[40:42] body
[40:43] safe that he should not be injurious to
[40:45] him in his Secrets or in the defense
[40:47] through which he is able to be secure
[40:49] honorable that he should not be
[40:51] injurious to him in Justice or in other
[40:53] matters that pertain to his honor
[40:55] useful that he should not be injurious
[40:57] to him in possessions easy or
[40:59] practicable that the good which his Lord
[41:01] is able to do easily he make not
[41:04] difficult nor that which is practicable
[41:06] he make impossible to him
[41:08] however that the faithful vassal should
[41:11] avoid these injuries as proper but not
[41:13] for this does he deserve his holding for
[41:15] it is not sufficient to abstain from
[41:17] Evil unless what is good is done also it
[41:21] remains therefore that in the same six
[41:22] things mentioned above he should be
[41:24] Faithfully he should Faithfully counsel
[41:26] and Aid his Lord if he wishes to be
[41:28] looked upon as worthy of his benefits
[41:31] and to be safe concerning the fealty
[41:33] which he has sworn
[41:34] the Lord also ought to act toward his
[41:37] faithful vastel reciprocally and all
[41:40] these things and if he does not do this
[41:42] he will be justly considered guilty of
[41:44] bad faith just as the former if he
[41:46] should be detected in the avoidance of
[41:48] or the doing of or consenting to them
[41:51] would be perfidious and perjured
[41:54] the Lord and vassal relationship was
[41:56] understood to have benefits for both
[41:58] parties while today many people look at
[42:02] headship and submission is one person
[42:04] giving up all their rights for nothing
[42:06] in history it was understood to have
[42:09] benefits going both ways even if you
[42:12] were the one that was swearing
[42:14] allegiance that you were pledging fealty
[42:16] that you were giving yourself over to a
[42:18] lord there was something you were
[42:20] getting in return it wasn't just that
[42:22] you were giving up your rights or giving
[42:24] up your ability to make decisions going
[42:27] I'll just do what you want there was
[42:29] something that was coming both
[42:30] directions this wasn't a one-sided
[42:32] relationship
[42:35] let's turn to First Corinthians chapter
[42:36] 15.
[42:41] First Corinthians chapter 15 and we'll
[42:43] start at verse 24.
[42:49] then come at the end when he shall have
[42:51] delivered up the kingdom to God even the
[42:53] father
[42:54] when he shall have put down all Rule and
[42:56] all authority and power for he must
[42:59] Reign till he hath put all enemies under
[43:01] his feet
[43:02] The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed
[43:04] is death for he hath put all things
[43:06] under his feet but when he saith all
[43:08] things are put under him it is Manifest
[43:10] that he is accepted which did put all
[43:13] things under him and when all things
[43:15] shall be subdued unto him then shall the
[43:17] son also himself be subject unto him
[43:20] that put all things under him that God
[43:23] may be all in all
[43:25] the scripture tells that even Christ is
[43:28] subject
[43:29] when we go to John chapter 5 and verse
[43:33] 19
[43:34] . it says then answered Jesus and said
[43:36] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[43:38] the son can do nothing of himself but
[43:41] what he seeth the father do for what
[43:43] things so ever he doeth these also doeth
[43:46] the son likewise for the Father loveth
[43:48] the Son and showeth him all things that
[43:50] himself doeth and he will show him
[43:51] Greater Works than these that ye may
[43:54] Marvel
[43:56] and so
[43:57] and then we go to Ephesians chapter five
[44:02] and starting at verse 21
[44:05] it says submitting yourselves one to
[44:07] another in the fear of God wives submit
[44:10] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[44:11] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[44:14] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[44:15] head of the church and he is the savior
[44:17] of the body
[44:18] therefore as the church is subject unto
[44:20] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[44:22] husbands and everything
[44:24] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[44:26] also loved the church and gave himself
[44:28] for it that he might sanctify and
[44:30] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[44:32] the word that he might present it to
[44:34] himself a glorious church not having
[44:36] spot or wrinkle or any such thing that
[44:38] it should be holy and without blemish
[44:40] so ought men to love their wives as
[44:43] their own bodies
[44:44] he that love is his wife loveth himself
[44:46] for for no man ever hated his own flesh
[44:50] but nourisheth it and cherished with it
[44:52] even as the Lord the church for we are
[44:54] members of his body of his flesh of his
[44:57] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[44:59] his father and mother and shall be
[45:00] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[45:03] be one flesh this is a great mystery but
[45:06] I speak concerning Christ and the church
[45:09] nevertheless let every one of you in
[45:10] particular so love his wife even as
[45:12] himself and the wife see that she
[45:14] reverence her husband
[45:16] and so Paul as he's writing he types it
[45:18] in the relationship between the husband
[45:20] and the wife but in verse 32 he makes it
[45:22] very clear this is a great mystery but I
[45:24] speak concerning Christ and the church
[45:26] not to say that the instruction doesn't
[45:28] apply to the marriage but I'm talking to
[45:31] you about the relationship with Christ
[45:32] I'm talking to you about the submission
[45:35] and the headship that we're going to
[45:37] have here
[45:39] brother Branham said in the sermon the
[45:41] medus meanest man in Santa Maria he said
[45:44] I was talking to someone today when
[45:46] Rebecca come to meet Isaac did you
[45:48] notice she veiled her State her face
[45:51] they still do they they don't know what
[45:53] they're doing but a bride veils her face
[45:54] why the man is her's head and then the
[45:58] nature of the woman is to yield to a man
[45:59] and that's the reason the church should
[46:01] be veiled it has got ahead that is
[46:03] Christ that's the way the woman is
[46:05] supposed to wear long hair because of
[46:06] her head which is her husband he used to
[46:08] have short hair because of Christ the
[46:10] woman wears long hair because of angels
[46:12] what is the Angels the messenger a true
[46:14] Messenger to the church that's right he
[46:16] will always call it down says it's wrong
[46:17] see and so forth and the church to be so
[46:20] yielded to Jesus that it don't claim its
[46:22] own head its own headship Christ is the
[46:24] headship of the church veiled we not our
[46:27] own but we're his yielded to him and him
[46:30] alone how beautiful
[46:32] so submission is the action or fact of
[46:36] accepting or yielding to a superior
[46:39] force or to the will or authority of
[46:42] another person
[46:45] when
[46:46] in medieval times when they would come
[46:48] to to swear fealty to give themselves
[46:50] over to another Lord they would come and
[46:53] they would bend the knee to the Lord and
[46:57] they would say I will
[46:59] first they had two different
[47:02] steps to it there was fealty and then I
[47:04] forget the term for the other one but
[47:05] the first thing they would do is
[47:06] basically an act of total surrender
[47:08] they would kneel down on both knees they
[47:11] would put their hands together in front
[47:13] of them and the Lord that they were
[47:15] swearing allegiance to would place his
[47:17] hands on the outside of their hands to
[47:19] signify that he accepted their complete
[47:21] surrender
[47:22] then they would go through feel to where
[47:24] they would just swear the oath and go
[47:27] through saying all the verbal things
[47:28] that I will govern the land as you would
[47:31] have me I will do this I will do that
[47:33] and in medieval times basically the idea
[47:36] was I'm swearing feel to you if you go
[47:40] into a war go into a battle I will call
[47:43] up the soldiers that I can I will come
[47:45] fight for you for whatever you deem is
[47:47] worthy of fighting for
[47:49] and then the leads Lord would be the one
[47:51] that would go okay I'm going to help uh
[47:54] provide for the land that you have I'm
[47:55] going to make sure that uh if you're
[47:58] attacked my Army's going to be coming in
[48:00] to to help fight for this I'm going to
[48:02] uh if you or things are going on that
[48:04] you need assistance with I'm here to
[48:07] help provide for it and so the vassal
[48:11] was there to work the land and to uh you
[48:15] know pay his uh his fees to his liege
[48:18] Lord and all these different things to
[48:19] call up the Army when need be but there
[48:21] was was a give and take relationship
[48:23] where they were both getting something
[48:24] from it you had one person that was
[48:27] above the other
[48:28] but yet it wasn't just a one-sided
[48:31] relationship they were both receiving
[48:33] something from it
[48:34] now this obviously isn't a perfect type
[48:36] of our relationship with Christ
[48:39] um
[48:39] but it begins to give us a better idea
[48:41] when we actually start to think about it
[48:43] instead of thinking about it from the
[48:44] way that Society wants us to think about
[48:46] when it comes to submission
[48:49] the most people if you talk to it have
[48:51] been in society and I I Society now
[48:54] would be
[48:55] if I'm going to submit
[48:57] it's gonna grade against me because I
[49:00] have my rights I have what I want to do
[49:02] I have how I want to handle things how I
[49:05] want to do things it's all about my
[49:08] rights we're in the age of laodicea it's
[49:10] all about people's rights and what I can
[49:12] do the idea of me submitting and giving
[49:15] up those rights to someone else
[49:17] just greats against most people
[49:22] in Isaiah chapter 4
[49:24] and verse 1.
[49:27] and in that day seven women shall take
[49:29] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[49:31] own bread and wear our own apparel only
[49:35] let us be called by then thy name to
[49:37] take away our approach
[49:40] brother Brandon said in the sermon the
[49:41] flashing red light of his coming he said
[49:44] when Isaiah 5 when he talked about how
[49:46] the immorals of the women would get in
[49:48] the last days and
[49:49] so much clothes they'd have and how
[49:51] they'd have to have their hair set and
[49:53] everything like that the Bible speaks
[49:54] that how she'd walk with high-heeled
[49:56] shoes on tinkling her feet as she went
[49:57] and
[49:58] and the things she would do and all that
[50:02] be taken away from her and she shall sit
[50:04] and stink for Immortal and said even
[50:06] seven women will grab one man and said
[50:07] we'll do our own work just let us take
[50:10] your name to take away our approach let
[50:13] us have your name
[50:15] but don't make us submit let us still be
[50:18] able to live the way that we want to let
[50:19] us still be able to do whatever we want
[50:21] just let us have your name so that
[50:24] you take away our reproach
[50:27] that's very much what we see in society
[50:28] where it goes well no I want to be able
[50:30] to do what I want
[50:31] you know it's pretty much standard now
[50:34] when people get married or get in a
[50:36] relationship they still keep completely
[50:37] separate bank accounts
[50:39] what the woman has this is her money
[50:41] what the man has this is his money
[50:44] maybe they have a third account where
[50:46] they share some
[50:48] but he has no right to what's hers she
[50:50] has no right to what's his they're
[50:52] separate
[50:54] that's like standard
[50:56] in today's society this is normal that
[50:59] people don't merge everything that it
[51:01] doesn't all come together it goes well
[51:03] no this way if we have to split up the
[51:05] break is easy you still have what's
[51:07] yours you still have what's yours we can
[51:09] go our separate ways and everything's
[51:10] fine
[51:12] but there are blessings that come from
[51:16] submission and headship
[51:19] that's what I'm going to be ministering
[51:21] on tonight is the blessings of
[51:23] submission
[51:24] so let's turn to to Genesis chapter 22.
[51:36] Genesis chapter 22
[51:39] and we'll start at verse 8.
[51:43] and Abraham said
[51:45] my son God will provide himself a lamb
[51:48] for a burnt offering
[51:50] so they went both of them together and
[51:52] they came to the place which God had
[51:54] told him of and Abraham built an altar
[51:56] there and laid the wood in order and
[51:58] bound Isaac his son and laid him on the
[52:00] altar upon the wood and Abraham
[52:02] stretched forth his hand and took the
[52:04] knife to slay his son and the angel of
[52:06] the Lord called unto him out of heaven
[52:08] and said Abraham Abraham and he said
[52:10] here am I and he said lay not thine hand
[52:13] upon the lad neither do thou anything
[52:15] unto him for now I know that thou
[52:16] feirest God seeing thou Hast not
[52:18] withheld thy son thine only son from me
[52:21] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[52:23] looked and behold behind him a ram
[52:24] caught in a Thicket by his horns and
[52:27] Abraham went and took the RAM and
[52:28] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[52:30] the stead of his son
[52:32] and Abraham called the name of that
[52:34] place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to
[52:36] this day in the Mount of the Lord it
[52:39] shall be seen
[52:41] I think this first one is pretty easy
[52:44] submission
[52:46] to proper headship
[52:48] brings you provision
[52:50] brother Brandon said in the sermon
[52:51] Jehovah Jireh said could you imagine
[52:53] this little boy Isaac being born Abraham
[52:56] and Sarah now about a hundred and
[52:59] and 15 years old was Sarah and about 125
[53:02] years old was Abraham wait here's the
[53:04] promised child that pretty little boy
[53:06] about 16 years old little hair hanging
[53:08] down over her shoulder a handsome little
[53:09] lad how he loved his father and his
[53:12] mother and Justin is obedient you know
[53:13] children that's what you ought to be to
[53:15] your father and mother I think it's
[53:17] awful when you hear young people say my
[53:18] old man and my old woman I don't believe
[53:20] you people in Carolina you little
[53:22] children would say that way up in the
[53:23] northern lands where I come from they
[53:25] see it and it's too bad they ever say it
[53:27] listen that's not the old man an old
[53:28] woman someday when the floors is
[53:30] creaking and cracking a casket is going
[53:31] out and you look and see a gray-headed
[53:33] person laying there it won't be the old
[53:34] man then that's your daddy that's your
[53:36] mother you honor them now that's the
[53:38] first commandment with promise honor
[53:40] your father and mother which may
[53:41] lengthen the days on the earth that the
[53:43] lord giveth thee so little Isaac being
[53:45] so subject in subjection to his father
[53:48] and mother because he was a type of
[53:50] Christ as he wasn't subject to the
[53:52] father perfectly and how he minded his
[53:54] father and mother
[53:56] in Jehovah Jireh brother random says and
[53:58] as he throw the wood on Little Isaac
[53:59] Soldier and climbed upon the hill a type
[54:01] of Christ wish we had time to go into it
[54:03] but we're pressed right now so up the
[54:05] hill when Isaac he said father
[54:07] here's the wood and here's the fire and
[54:09] the altar but where is the Lamb for the
[54:11] burnt offering he said my son God will
[54:13] provide for himself a lamb oh my you see
[54:16] it something had to happen God will
[54:18] provide I told the boys you and I'd be
[54:21] back God told me to come up here and
[54:23] kill you but God will provide somehow I
[54:25] don't know how I'm going to come out but
[54:27] I'm just walking on God will provide I
[54:29] love that don't you his faith didn't
[54:31] fail he didn't stagger reached over
[54:34] goddess son tied his hands and feet his
[54:36] only beloved Son God and Abraham you see
[54:39] it God and Abraham could tell God could
[54:41] take his own word through Abraham to
[54:42] trust himself and if you've got the Holy
[54:44] Spirit surely God would trust his own
[54:46] word as your healer as your savior
[54:52] Abraham was
[54:54] under submission he was willing to do
[54:57] what his head had told him to
[55:00] his head commanded him go sacrifice your
[55:03] son
[55:04] logically this makes no sense
[55:07] we've heard sermon after sermon go into
[55:10] this but Abraham was willing to be in
[55:12] submission and go this is what I'm told
[55:15] this is what I'm gonna do and God will
[55:18] provide
[55:19] I don't know how
[55:21] I can't explain it but I know that God
[55:25] will provide as long as I continue to do
[55:28] what he's telling me to do as long as I
[55:30] continue to remain in submission to him
[55:37] brother random said in the sermon God
[55:39] hath provided a way
[55:42] Moses the father and mother of Moses had
[55:44] to do something similar to that how is
[55:46] Moses going to deliver the people when
[55:48] they seen you as a fair child if they
[55:49] shoved him out there in the midst of a
[55:50] bunch of crocodiles how is he going to
[55:52] be a deliverer how is he going to do it
[55:54] well they received him in that manner so
[55:56] they pushed him back out into the
[55:57] crocodiles knowing god could take care
[55:59] of it and God did take care of it God
[56:02] got his hand on his church God got his
[56:03] hand on his man on his woman God is able
[56:06] to take care of the situation so Abraham
[56:08] said we will return when you left home
[56:10] this morning did you tell husband when I
[56:12] come back I'll be feeling different yes
[56:14] sir how are you going to know it I don't
[56:15] know but I will oh amen I'll be
[56:18] different when I come back you just
[56:19] watch and see how are you going to do it
[56:21] God will provide there when this great
[56:23] crucial hour come and they went up to
[56:25] the top of the mountain and Abraham took
[56:27] his knife out took the little boy and he
[56:29] said this question to him said father
[56:30] here's the wood here's the altar but
[56:32] where is the burnt offering he said God
[56:34] will provide an offering isn't that a
[56:36] lesson to us God will provide there's no
[56:37] need of us getting all upset about
[56:39] anything God will provide it
[56:42] in First Kings chapter 17
[56:45] we find Elijah and
[56:51] he is
[56:53] he comes to deliver the message
[56:56] it's not going to rain until I say so
[56:59] he comes to to Ahab and tells him
[57:03] until I give the word there's going to
[57:06] be no rain there's going to be no Dew
[57:07] and then he immediately follows God's
[57:10] command to go east and hide thyself by
[57:13] the Brook cherith that is before Jordan
[57:18] he goes and
[57:20] the scriptures tell us that the Ravens
[57:22] brought him bread and flesh in the
[57:24] morning
[57:25] and bread and flesh in the evening and
[57:28] he drank of the brook
[57:31] got he didn't have to prepare all the
[57:33] food himself and take this huge pack of
[57:35] supplies
[57:37] he went in submission ago this is where
[57:39] God told me to go
[57:41] this is what I'm supposed to do and when
[57:43] he gets there God provides God doesn't
[57:46] provide in a way that would be expected
[57:49] but he still makes sure to provide so
[57:51] the prophet had sustenance while he was
[57:53] there you know he probably expected I'm
[57:55] going to the brook there should be some
[57:57] water he expected that part he probably
[58:00] didn't expect when the first Raven
[58:02] showed up with bread and fish
[58:04] he probably didn't see that one coming
[58:06] here comes the food okay this is how
[58:09] it's going to be and he was able to eat
[58:12] because
[58:13] God was continuing to provide
[58:18] as we continue through the story The
[58:21] Brook dries up
[58:22] and Elijah gets sent on and he's sent to
[58:26] meet
[58:28] the the widow woman
[58:30] and so he goes and here she is she's
[58:34] Gathering up the last two sticks so that
[58:37] she can make the last of her meal for
[58:40] her and her son and then they'll die
[58:44] and Elijah comes and he says fear not
[58:47] go and do as thou I said but make me
[58:50] thereof a little cake first and bring it
[58:52] unto me and after make for thee and for
[58:55] thy son
[58:56] she then has the decision to make on am
[58:59] I going to listen to the word
[59:03] am I going to come under subjection of
[59:05] this word that's being given to me
[59:07] I have the choice I can either be
[59:10] subject to it or I cannot
[59:13] looking at it logically from this moment
[59:15] this makes no sense
[59:18] why would I give this to this strange
[59:20] man
[59:22] who's now telling me
[59:23] It's Gonna Last
[59:26] but instead she chooses to be under
[59:29] subjection
[59:31] to the prophet whether she knew it was
[59:33] the prophet right at that moment I don't
[59:35] know
[59:37] but she chooses to come under subjection
[59:39] of it and because she came under
[59:41] subjection she was provided for
[59:44] because she chose to come in her
[59:46] subjection
[59:47] the oil lasted and the meal lasted and
[59:49] so they kept eating and they didn't have
[59:51] to die now she could have if she had
[59:54] gone and done it her own way and not
[59:56] been her subjection they would have ate
[59:58] one meal and that would have been it it
[1:00:01] would have been the end but she chose to
[1:00:03] come under subjection and so subjection
[1:00:06] to the proper headship
[1:00:07] gives provision it provides for us it
[1:00:10] gives us what we have need of at that
[1:00:12] time
[1:00:15] you know we can go into uh the story of
[1:00:18] Ruth
[1:00:19] and here we find Ruth as she comes back
[1:00:23] to the land of Israel with Naomi and
[1:00:27] they come back and they have nothing
[1:00:30] they're just two Widow women
[1:00:33] they have no way to provide and so Ruth
[1:00:36] decides to go glean in the field
[1:00:39] and she happens to go to boaz's field
[1:00:43] and she's there working and Boaz comes
[1:00:46] and talks to her after he finds out who
[1:00:49] she is he comes and talks to her and he
[1:00:51] says
[1:00:52] here's thou not my daughter go not to
[1:00:55] glean in another field neither go from
[1:00:58] hence but abide here fast by my maidens
[1:01:02] let thine eyes be on the field they do
[1:01:04] reap and go after them have I not
[1:01:06] charged the young man that they shall
[1:01:07] not touch thee and when thou art of
[1:01:09] thirst go unto the vessels and drink of
[1:01:12] that which the young men have drawn
[1:01:17] she gives him instructions stay here
[1:01:20] stay here and you'll be provided for
[1:01:22] you now she could have been like well I
[1:01:25] can glean here for a while and I can
[1:01:26] probably go in that other field for you
[1:01:28] know at least an hour or two and get a
[1:01:30] couple more over there
[1:01:31] she could have made that kind of
[1:01:33] decision to go hey I'm going to work
[1:01:34] double shifts I'm going to get extra at
[1:01:35] this other field so we can really get it
[1:01:37] coming in
[1:01:38] like sometimes us guys want to do I'll
[1:01:40] work double shifts and maybe it means
[1:01:42] that I'm going to miss church but I'll
[1:01:43] I'll do the double shifts that I can get
[1:01:45] a little bit more coming in
[1:01:47] um
[1:01:49] but yet they had the instruction on how
[1:01:51] to be provided for
[1:01:53] stay in my field I'll make sure it look
[1:01:55] have the water you're not limited from
[1:01:57] it the my men are drawing the water you
[1:02:00] don't even have to draw it yourself
[1:02:01] you just go over drink
[1:02:03] you'll be safe here I've commanded
[1:02:05] everyone not to touch you
[1:02:07] just come here and you will be provided
[1:02:10] for
[1:02:11] and so she goes through this and she
[1:02:13] continues
[1:02:15] through it and
[1:02:17] after she had
[1:02:19] risen
[1:02:21] to to go and and follow the the the
[1:02:24] command that he'd given her
[1:02:27] he tells his Reapers drop extra
[1:02:30] make sure that there's extra on the
[1:02:33] ground floor drop the handfuls of
[1:02:34] purpose just to make sure
[1:02:37] that there's no temptation to go
[1:02:40] somewhere else
[1:02:41] I want to make sure she has plenty
[1:02:44] so that way she and her mother-in-law
[1:02:47] will be taken care of
[1:02:50] we continue on through the the story of
[1:02:53] Ruth and Naomi
[1:02:55] is now the one giving her instructions
[1:02:58] going hey
[1:02:59] Boaz is going to be at his threshing
[1:03:01] floor
[1:03:03] and after he falls asleep this is what I
[1:03:06] want you to do
[1:03:08] now once again Ruth has the choice of
[1:03:11] am I going to be in submission to the
[1:03:15] guidance that I'm being given to the
[1:03:16] headship that's that's in place right
[1:03:18] now
[1:03:20] she what didn't have one a man to be in
[1:03:22] headship over her but she had her
[1:03:24] mother-in-law
[1:03:25] she had the Elder that was in place to
[1:03:27] give her the instruction to go this is
[1:03:29] what you need to do
[1:03:30] and so she's like okay
[1:03:32] I'm going to go through this I'm going
[1:03:34] to do as I've been instructed
[1:03:37] and she goes to the place and she goes
[1:03:40] and she waits till Boaz is asleep and
[1:03:42] she uncovers his feet and lays down at
[1:03:45] his feet and waits for him to wake up
[1:03:50] and they have the whole conversation
[1:03:53] we're on to save time a little bit I'm
[1:03:55] not going to read through the whole
[1:03:56] story we all have read this story so
[1:03:58] many times
[1:03:59] but
[1:04:00] he sells her that she's uh
[1:04:05] he thanks her for uh coming and being
[1:04:08] interested in marrying him
[1:04:10] um and he says you know what I'm not the
[1:04:12] closest Kinsman
[1:04:14] I have to go talk to somebody else
[1:04:18] but I don't want you to worry about it
[1:04:20] I want you to go back home
[1:04:23] and wait there until I
[1:04:25] come for you until I come to talk to you
[1:04:29] and then he makes sure he says bring the
[1:04:33] veil thou Hast upon me
[1:04:34] and hold it and when she held it he
[1:04:37] measured six measures of barley and laid
[1:04:39] it on her and she went into the city
[1:04:43] I want you to go
[1:04:46] while I deal with this situation but let
[1:04:48] me make sure that you've got food while
[1:04:49] you're gone
[1:04:50] let me make sure that you have no need
[1:04:53] to leave the house you don't need to go
[1:04:54] reap anywhere
[1:04:55] I've provided here's what you need
[1:04:59] and when she goes home Naomi tells her
[1:05:02] the same thing says good rest here
[1:05:04] because he won't rest until it's handled
[1:05:07] and so she remains in ah
[1:05:11] submission
[1:05:14] and because of that she's provided for
[1:05:16] and because of that she's redeemed and
[1:05:19] because of that she becomes the wife to
[1:05:23] Boaz because she keeps being willing to
[1:05:26] be in submission to the headship that's
[1:05:28] around her to the instructions she's
[1:05:30] being given to go this is what I need to
[1:05:33] do
[1:05:34] and the provision will come it didn't
[1:05:36] mean that for the longest time she
[1:05:38] didn't have to work she still had to go
[1:05:39] reap in the field she still had to do
[1:05:41] her part
[1:05:42] but the instructions were there for the
[1:05:44] Reapers keep dropping a little bit extra
[1:05:46] make sure she has everything that she
[1:05:49] needs
[1:05:51] Luke chapter 12 and verse 24.
[1:05:56] it says consider the Ravens for they
[1:05:58] neither sow nor reap which neither have
[1:06:00] Storehouse nor Barn
[1:06:02] and God feedeth them how much more are
[1:06:05] ye better than the fowls and which of
[1:06:07] you with taking thought can add to his
[1:06:09] stature one cubit
[1:06:11] if ye then be not able to do that which
[1:06:13] is least why take you thought for the
[1:06:16] rest
[1:06:16] consider the lilies how they grow they
[1:06:19] toil not they spin not
[1:06:21] and yet I say unto you that Solomon in
[1:06:24] all his glory was not arrayed like one
[1:06:25] of these if then God so clothed the
[1:06:28] grass which is today in the field and
[1:06:30] tomorrow is cast into the oven how much
[1:06:32] more will he clothe You O ye of little
[1:06:35] faith and seek not
[1:06:37] ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall
[1:06:40] drink neither be of doubtful mind for
[1:06:43] all these things do the nations of the
[1:06:45] world seek after and your father knoweth
[1:06:47] that you have need of these things but
[1:06:49] rather seek ye the kingdom of God and
[1:06:52] all these things shall be added unto you
[1:07:00] Lord
[1:07:01] let's turn to Luke chapter 16.
[1:07:16] we'll talk about one of the
[1:07:19] talk about Another Blessing of
[1:07:20] submission of submission here Luke
[1:07:22] chapter 16 and verse 10.
[1:07:26] he that is faithful in that which is
[1:07:28] least is faithful also in much
[1:07:31] and he that is unjust in the least
[1:07:33] is unjust also in much
[1:07:38] let's go to Matthew chapter 8.
[1:07:48] Matthew chapter 8.
[1:07:51] and starting at verse 5.
[1:07:55] and when Jesus was entered into
[1:07:56] Capernaum there came unto him a
[1:07:58] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[1:08:01] my servant lieth at home sick of the
[1:08:03] palsy grievously tormented and Jesus
[1:08:05] saith on him I will come and heal him
[1:08:08] the Centurion answered and said Lord I
[1:08:10] am not worthy that thou should has come
[1:08:12] under my roof but speak the word only
[1:08:14] and my servant shall be healed for I am
[1:08:17] a man under Authority having soldiers
[1:08:19] under me and I say to this man go and he
[1:08:21] goeth and to another come and he cometh
[1:08:24] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[1:08:26] it when Jesus heard it he marveled and
[1:08:29] said to them that followed verily I say
[1:08:30] unto you I have not found so great faith
[1:08:33] no not in Israel and I say unto you that
[1:08:36] many shall come from the East and West
[1:08:37] and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and
[1:08:40] Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the
[1:08:42] children of the Kingdom shall be cast
[1:08:43] out into outer Darkness there shall be
[1:08:45] weeping and gnashing of teeth and Jesus
[1:08:48] said unto the Centurion go thy way and
[1:08:50] as thou Hast believed so it be done unto
[1:08:52] thee and his servant was healed in the
[1:08:55] self-same hour
[1:09:06] now the Centurion said he said I'm a man
[1:09:09] under Authority
[1:09:11] and to reach the rank of centurion he
[1:09:15] didn't step into that day one
[1:09:17] he had gone through a process he had
[1:09:20] gone through a process where he had had
[1:09:22] to be proven he had had to show that he
[1:09:24] was willing to follow his orders that he
[1:09:26] was willing to do the dirty job that he
[1:09:29] was willing to do this and do that and
[1:09:31] through that he had advanced
[1:09:34] and so he had come to the point where
[1:09:35] now he had authority of other over
[1:09:37] others but he had only given he was only
[1:09:40] given that Authority because he had been
[1:09:43] subject to Authority because he was
[1:09:46] willing to be in submission and do what
[1:09:50] he was told
[1:09:51] if he had been a man that complete what
[1:09:53] was always disobeying orders and always
[1:09:55] doing the wrong thing he wouldn't have
[1:09:58] advanced
[1:09:59] and so when we
[1:10:02] are under submission to Authority when
[1:10:05] we're under submission to our headship a
[1:10:07] lot of times we can find that Authority
[1:10:09] is given to us
[1:10:11] that we get into a place where we begin
[1:10:13] to have authority as we move through
[1:10:16] brother random said in the sermon Jairus
[1:10:18] he says in the Roman Centurion that had
[1:10:20] a friend that was sick his servant he
[1:10:22] said I'm not even worthy that you come
[1:10:24] under my roof just speak the word for I
[1:10:26] am a man under Authority and I say to
[1:10:28] this man do this and he doeth it and to
[1:10:31] this man do that and he do with it see
[1:10:33] that Roman recognized that Jesus his
[1:10:35] word had all the power that was needed
[1:10:37] for the healing of the person he knew
[1:10:39] that was in him was invested the power
[1:10:41] of Jehovah God and he knew that whatever
[1:10:43] Jesus said that he mastered diseases he
[1:10:46] mastered the sea he mastered the
[1:10:47] universe that's what he is tonight the
[1:10:49] same yesterday today and forever if you
[1:10:51] could only recognize that his word has
[1:10:53] Supremacy over every demon every Power
[1:10:56] every all everything every sin every
[1:10:58] sickness every disease every
[1:11:01] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:11:03] and forever believe what he said he said
[1:11:05] I'm a man under Authority and I know
[1:11:07] that anybody's under me has to obey me
[1:11:10] and my word is Law and Order he has to
[1:11:12] do it and he knew that Jesus Christ had
[1:11:15] sickness under his feet he had disease
[1:11:17] under his feet so when we look at it in
[1:11:20] the physical natural realm I have
[1:11:23] authority at my job
[1:11:26] I have that Authority because someone
[1:11:28] else gave me this Authority
[1:11:31] I didn't go in and throw my weight
[1:11:33] around and go you've got to listen to me
[1:11:35] because I'm bigger and stronger than you
[1:11:37] I've got to do this it was my boss said
[1:11:40] hey this is your job
[1:11:42] this is what you have the authority to
[1:11:44] do
[1:11:45] you can't do this but you can do this
[1:11:49] and as long as I'm abiding by The
[1:11:51] Authority that I've been granted
[1:11:54] there are those that have to listen to
[1:11:56] what I say there are those that have to
[1:11:58] follow my instructions because I have
[1:12:00] authority at a certain level
[1:12:03] now this is an authority that's not by
[1:12:05] my own making
[1:12:07] Authority isn't something that I have
[1:12:08] because of my own strength or because of
[1:12:11] my own power
[1:12:12] Authority comes from something else
[1:12:14] someone else gave it to me and now I'm
[1:12:17] expressing their strength I'm expressing
[1:12:20] their power through the authority that
[1:12:22] I'm using
[1:12:24] you know if we look at it from the the
[1:12:26] marriage
[1:12:27] uh and and the way that God has created
[1:12:30] is I as the husband have a certain level
[1:12:32] of authority that God has given me God
[1:12:35] has placed me as the head of my home
[1:12:36] this is the god-given authority that I
[1:12:39] have
[1:12:39] my wife has an authority within the home
[1:12:42] she has an authority over the children
[1:12:44] she has an authority over the way the
[1:12:46] house is run she has an authority over
[1:12:48] these different things that Authority
[1:12:50] was not given to her by me so I can't
[1:12:53] take it away
[1:12:55] even though it may look like I'm above
[1:12:58] her in Authority I didn't give the
[1:13:00] authority to her so I can't take it away
[1:13:03] her Authority was given to her by God to
[1:13:06] go this is your role as the wife this is
[1:13:08] your role as the mother
[1:13:10] and it may be my place to be the head
[1:13:13] but that doesn't mean I can tell her
[1:13:15] well this isn't your job anymore
[1:13:18] because an authority above me told her
[1:13:21] this is her job
[1:13:23] so the person The Authority comes from
[1:13:25] is the one that can take away the
[1:13:28] authority
[1:13:30] not someone else
[1:13:34] I didn't give it to her so I can't take
[1:13:37] it away
[1:13:39] she didn't give me my authority so she
[1:13:41] can't take it away from me God is the
[1:13:43] one who lay down said this is Brother
[1:13:45] Colby as the head of your home this is
[1:13:47] your Authority
[1:13:49] Sister Mary this is your Authority
[1:13:51] brother Colby you have no right to take
[1:13:53] away sister Mary's Authority this is how
[1:13:56] she takes care of the kids when you're
[1:13:58] at work make sure the house is taken
[1:14:00] care of does these things runs the
[1:14:02] household in different ways that's her
[1:14:04] Authority
[1:14:06] you have your Authority as the head of
[1:14:08] the home and Sister Mary has no right to
[1:14:10] take that away from you or to undermine
[1:14:11] it or undercut it because this is how
[1:14:13] God laid it out
[1:14:16] we all have the authority we've been
[1:14:18] given but it isn't that brother Kobe is
[1:14:22] the head and so he gives sister Mary The
[1:14:23] Authority no
[1:14:25] God laid it out God said this is your
[1:14:28] Authority
[1:14:29] as the wife as the mother this is what
[1:14:32] you are in charge of this is how you're
[1:14:35] handling things
[1:14:38] and I think that's one of the things
[1:14:39] that we break down a lot of times
[1:14:41] because we think about it like a
[1:14:42] hierarchy all too often like we see in a
[1:14:45] business of this person above this
[1:14:47] person above this person above this
[1:14:48] person so if the husbands of love the
[1:14:50] wife then the husband can do whatever he
[1:14:52] wants to tell the wife whatever he wants
[1:14:54] except that her Authority doesn't come
[1:14:56] from him
[1:14:58] so that's not the way it works it's not
[1:15:00] the way it connects her Authority comes
[1:15:03] from someone above the husband
[1:15:06] her position is decreed by the husband's
[1:15:10] Authority
[1:15:15] brother random said in the sermon and
[1:15:17] ensign
[1:15:18] he says we don't have power
[1:15:22] we've got Authority it's not a power
[1:15:23] it's Authority we don't need power
[1:15:25] Christ has the power but we've got the
[1:15:28] authority amen there's a lot of
[1:15:30] difference he was the one who conquered
[1:15:31] he conquered and gave us the authority
[1:15:34] he's got the power but we got the
[1:15:36] authority just like any Ambassador going
[1:15:38] to another country
[1:15:39] here to explain it to you
[1:15:41] you go down here at one of these
[1:15:43] Crossings here in Phoenix along about
[1:15:44] five o'clock in the afternoon there's a
[1:15:46] policeman standing out there here's the
[1:15:48] cars passing by at 40 50 miles an hour
[1:15:50] well that bit little bitty policeman
[1:15:53] maybe not five foot high walk out there
[1:15:56] why he hasn't got power enough to stop
[1:15:58] one of them cars one of them cars maybe
[1:16:00] 300 horsepower well they just pick up
[1:16:03] that little fellow up and crush them and
[1:16:04] go on but let him raise his hand once
[1:16:06] blow the whistle he hasn't got power but
[1:16:10] he's got Authority that's it brakes will
[1:16:12] slide wheels will squeak everything will
[1:16:14] stop because he raised up his hand
[1:16:16] because he has an authority and when a
[1:16:19] man or a woman is dressed in the full
[1:16:20] armor of God it ain't power it's
[1:16:23] Authority from on high when he says
[1:16:25] Devils will scream and brakes will
[1:16:27] squeak even death itself will shudder
[1:16:29] and graves will open at the authority
[1:16:31] that Jesus Christ gave his church all
[1:16:34] men know this these signs shall follow
[1:16:36] them that believe lift up the authority
[1:16:38] the Ensign his hand raise up with his
[1:16:41] white glove on and every car will stop
[1:16:43] he hasn't got enough power maybe to stop
[1:16:46] a bicycle but he's got authority to stop
[1:16:48] anything that comes across that street
[1:16:50] because why the whole law of Phoenix is
[1:16:53] behind him and a Christian that's dead
[1:16:55] and buried and raised with him in his
[1:16:57] resurrection in Heavenly places see if
[1:16:59] we're Dead with him then we're also
[1:17:01] raised with him for the body goes where
[1:17:03] the head is and he is the head and this
[1:17:05] is the body and not will be but now we
[1:17:07] are seated together in Heavenly places
[1:17:09] in Christ Jesus with every Power of the
[1:17:11] devil conquered and under his feet
[1:17:13] authority authority there is the answer
[1:17:15] that's the hand that lifts up that
[1:17:18] counts
[1:17:21] we don't when we stand against the devil
[1:17:24] coming in with sickness or with trial or
[1:17:27] any of these different things it's not
[1:17:29] because of our power or our strength
[1:17:32] it's we're able to stand with the
[1:17:34] authority of Christ he's the one with
[1:17:37] the power he's the one with the strength
[1:17:39] and that power
[1:17:42] isn't just to the husband as the head of
[1:17:45] the home
[1:17:46] the wife
[1:17:48] has that same authority to call on when
[1:17:51] the husband's at work and the kids are
[1:17:53] running wild around the house
[1:17:55] and she they're acting like little
[1:17:58] Devils she has the same authority to
[1:18:01] begin to bring it under control she has
[1:18:03] the same authority to apply to that home
[1:18:07] now maybe dad has to come and do some
[1:18:09] whippings when he comes home
[1:18:11] it happens
[1:18:13] but she has the authority if one of her
[1:18:16] kids is getting sick she has the
[1:18:18] authority to say the prayer to lay on
[1:18:22] the Hands of Faith and apply the token
[1:18:25] she has that same Authority
[1:18:27] because the authority
[1:18:29] comes from
[1:18:31] the one above the man
[1:18:33] comes from Christ because Christ is the
[1:18:35] one who laid it out and said this is the
[1:18:38] authority that each of these positions
[1:18:39] have
[1:18:40] I'm the one giving it to you
[1:18:44] Philippians chapter 2
[1:18:48] and verse 5 it says
[1:18:50] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:18:52] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:18:55] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:18:56] with God but made himself of no
[1:18:58] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:19:01] a servant and was made in likeness of
[1:19:03] men and being found in fashion as a man
[1:19:05] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:19:08] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:19:15] he put himself under submission and
[1:19:18] became obedient
[1:19:20] he became obedient to the instruction
[1:19:22] the father was giving to go
[1:19:24] you're going to die now
[1:19:27] he didn't want to we know from the
[1:19:29] garden he was going Lord let this cup
[1:19:31] pass I don't want to die
[1:19:35] no human
[1:19:37] would want to die
[1:19:41] brother Brandon told us in different
[1:19:42] sermons as a man he had the right
[1:19:45] to get married he had the right to have
[1:19:47] a life he had the right to live out
[1:19:50] these different things but he chose to
[1:19:52] instead be under the headship
[1:19:55] be in submission
[1:19:58] and give up those rights
[1:20:02] to then be the sacrifice he humbled
[1:20:04] himself down to the point that he would
[1:20:06] follow the instructions that he was
[1:20:08] given
[1:20:10] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[1:20:13] him and given him a name which is above
[1:20:15] every name that at the name of Jesus
[1:20:17] every knee should bow of things that
[1:20:19] heaven and things in the earth and
[1:20:21] things under the Earth and that every
[1:20:23] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] is Lord to the glory of God the Father
[1:20:32] submission to proper headship
[1:20:35] can bring Authority
[1:20:37] that can happen in the natural
[1:20:41] that can happen in the spiritual that
[1:20:43] God gives us the authority
[1:20:46] to deal with these different situations
[1:20:48] that come along it's not our power it's
[1:20:50] not our strength to overcome
[1:20:52] but as us our Authority that's been
[1:20:55] given to us by him
[1:21:00] let's go to First Samuel chapter 10.
[1:21:15] first Samuel chapter 10
[1:21:20] and verse 17.
[1:21:25] and Samuel called the people together
[1:21:27] unto the Lord to mizpah
[1:21:29] and said unto the children of Israel
[1:21:30] thus saith the Lord God of Israel I
[1:21:32] brought up Israel out of Egypt and
[1:21:34] delivered you out of the hand of the
[1:21:36] Egyptians and out of the hand of all
[1:21:38] kingdoms and of them that oppressed you
[1:21:40] and you have this day rejected your God
[1:21:42] who himself saved you all out of your
[1:21:44] adversities and your tribulations and
[1:21:46] you have said on him nay but set a king
[1:21:48] over us now therefore present yourselves
[1:21:50] before the Lord by your tribes and by
[1:21:52] your thousands and when Samuel had
[1:21:54] caused all cause all the tribes of
[1:21:57] Israel to come near The Tribe of
[1:21:58] Benjamin was taken
[1:22:00] when he had caused The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:22:01] to come nearby their families the family
[1:22:03] of maitri was taken and Saul the son of
[1:22:06] Kish was taken and when they sought him
[1:22:08] he could not be found therefore they
[1:22:10] inquired of the Lord further if the man
[1:22:12] should yet come thither and the Lord
[1:22:13] answered behold he hath hid himself
[1:22:15] among the stuff and they ran and fetched
[1:22:17] him fence and when he stood among the
[1:22:19] people he was higher than any of the
[1:22:21] people from his shoulder and upward and
[1:22:23] Samuel said to all the people see him
[1:22:25] whom the Lord hath chosen that there is
[1:22:27] none like him among all the people
[1:22:29] and all the people shouted and said God
[1:22:31] saved the king then Samuel told the
[1:22:33] people the manner of the kingdom and
[1:22:35] wrote it in a book and laid it up before
[1:22:37] the Lord and Samuel sent all the people
[1:22:39] away every man to his house and Saul
[1:22:41] also went home to gibea and there went
[1:22:43] with him a band of man his Hearts God
[1:22:45] had touched
[1:22:47] so we start out with this story with
[1:22:49] Israel
[1:22:51] deciding that they
[1:22:53] don't want to be in submission
[1:22:55] they don't want to be under the headship
[1:22:58] of God
[1:23:00] they want a king
[1:23:03] and
[1:23:06] Samuel's upset
[1:23:10] and God tells him you don't need to be
[1:23:12] upset they didn't reject you they
[1:23:15] rejected me
[1:23:16] and God gives them what they asked for
[1:23:19] said okay we'll give them a king they
[1:23:23] didn't want to be under submission to me
[1:23:25] they didn't want to be under my headship
[1:23:27] so we'll give them a king for them to be
[1:23:29] under submission to a King whose
[1:23:31] headship they're going to follow
[1:23:35] yeah in the sermon in the Samaritan
[1:23:37] Church age and the church age book it
[1:23:38] says when they approached Samuel and
[1:23:39] asked for a King Samuel was so dismayed
[1:23:42] that his heart almost failed him God had
[1:23:44] been leading his people through this
[1:23:45] consecrated scripture Vindicated prophet
[1:23:48] and he felt that he had been rejected he
[1:23:50] gathered the people and pleaded with
[1:23:52] them not to turn away from The God Who
[1:23:53] had carried them like children and
[1:23:55] prosper them and bless them but they
[1:23:57] persisted they said to Samuel you've
[1:23:59] never been wrong in your leading you've
[1:24:00] never been dishonest in your financial
[1:24:02] dealings you've done your best to keep
[1:24:04] us in line with the word of the lord we
[1:24:06] appreciate the Miracles wisdom provision
[1:24:08] and protection of God we believe in it
[1:24:10] we like it and furthermore we don't want
[1:24:12] to be without it it's just that we want
[1:24:14] a king to lead us to battle
[1:24:17] we just want to have something we can
[1:24:20] see we just want to have someone that we
[1:24:23] can look at and go this is who's leading
[1:24:25] us this is who we're following this is
[1:24:28] who we're listening to
[1:24:32] and so they rejected one
[1:24:35] submission
[1:24:37] so God gives them the king God gives
[1:24:40] them Saul
[1:24:41] Saul's appointed as king it's all laid
[1:24:43] out this is how the kingdom is going to
[1:24:45] work it's written in the book
[1:24:46] they all go home
[1:24:49] and at first it doesn't really seem like
[1:24:51] anything changes Saul went back home to
[1:24:52] gibia
[1:24:54] it's not like he's out throwing orders
[1:24:55] around right away he just he went home
[1:24:57] everybody went home the only thing that
[1:24:59] changed was there's some men that
[1:25:00] followed him
[1:25:01] so now Saul has all these people
[1:25:04] that he's got to take care of at his
[1:25:05] house
[1:25:06] that he's got to make sure fed and
[1:25:08] clothed and armed
[1:25:12] because they'd followed him
[1:25:13] but beyond that nothing changed in
[1:25:16] Israel he didn't start making decrees
[1:25:19] about this that or the other he just
[1:25:21] went home
[1:25:26] in first Samuel chapter 11.
[1:25:31] and verse 1.
[1:25:34] the ammonite came up and it camped
[1:25:38] against jabish Gilead
[1:25:40] and all the men of jebusch said unto
[1:25:42] nahatch make a covenant with us and we
[1:25:44] will serve thee
[1:25:46] and nahash the m and I answered them on
[1:25:48] this condition will I make a covenant
[1:25:49] with you that I may thrust out all of
[1:25:51] your right eyes and lay it for a
[1:25:53] reproach upon all Israel
[1:25:55] and the Elders of jabus said unto him
[1:25:57] give us seven days respite that we may
[1:25:59] send Messengers unto all the coasts of
[1:26:01] Israel and then if there be no man to
[1:26:03] save us we will come out to thee
[1:26:05] then came The Messengers to gibea of
[1:26:08] Saul and told the tidings and the ears
[1:26:10] of the people and all the people lifted
[1:26:12] up their voices and wept and behold Saul
[1:26:15] came after the herd out of the field and
[1:26:17] Saul said what ailith the people that
[1:26:19] they weep and they told them the tidings
[1:26:21] of the men of jabish and the spirit of
[1:26:24] God Came Upon Saul when he heard those
[1:26:25] Tidings and his anger was kindled
[1:26:27] greatly and he took a yoke of oxen and
[1:26:30] hewed them in pieces and sent them
[1:26:31] throughout all the coasts of Israel by
[1:26:33] the hands of Messengers saying whosoever
[1:26:35] cometh not forth after Saul and after
[1:26:37] Samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen
[1:26:40] and the fear of the Lord fell on the
[1:26:42] people and they came out with one
[1:26:44] consent
[1:26:47] so the enemy comes to jabish Gillian
[1:26:50] and said to take him out and jabus
[1:26:53] Gillian
[1:26:54] who
[1:26:56] is supposed to be
[1:26:58] under headship of a king now
[1:27:02] on their own goes well let's make a deal
[1:27:06] let's
[1:27:07] we'll we'll do a covenant with you we'll
[1:27:09] what do you want we'll give it to you
[1:27:12] everything will be fine we don't need a
[1:27:14] king to come save us we can do this deal
[1:27:16] on our own
[1:27:18] and the enemy goes great
[1:27:21] I want to Blind every single man in one
[1:27:24] eye I want all of your right eyes
[1:27:28] okay this didn't seem like a good deal
[1:27:30] anymore
[1:27:32] they thought they could make a deal and
[1:27:33] then they go
[1:27:36] okay well give us seven days to see if
[1:27:38] there's anyone that will will come save
[1:27:40] us and if they won't then we'll come out
[1:27:43] and give them to you
[1:27:45] now don't really understand the enemy's
[1:27:46] thought
[1:27:48] why he didn't just go ahead and take
[1:27:49] them
[1:27:50] through Force maybe he thought hey no
[1:27:52] one's going to come save him and then I
[1:27:54] don't have to fight
[1:27:55] all you got to do is sit around for
[1:27:57] seven days and the exact same thing will
[1:27:59] happen maybe that was his thought I
[1:28:01] don't know which one it was
[1:28:02] but they send out Messengers
[1:28:05] and here's Saul the king
[1:28:07] and I will point out
[1:28:09] still nothing had changed Saul was still
[1:28:12] out in the field plowing
[1:28:15] he was still working in the field the
[1:28:17] same as he always had
[1:28:21] he was the king
[1:28:24] but at this point there was no
[1:28:26] difference
[1:28:27] he was still there just working
[1:28:30] his father's land doing like he'd always
[1:28:33] done every other day of his life
[1:28:37] but then the message comes
[1:28:40] hey
[1:28:42] they're all gonna lose the right ice
[1:28:45] because the enemy has come into the land
[1:28:49] and then the headship Rises up
[1:28:53] because
[1:28:55] his anger is kindled his righteous
[1:28:56] indignation
[1:28:59] gets kicked up and he goes
[1:29:01] known
[1:29:02] that's not happening
[1:29:04] that is not acceptable
[1:29:06] and so he sends this message out to the
[1:29:09] entire country
[1:29:10] he kills his oxen he Hues apart
[1:29:15] all the instruments he was using
[1:29:19] his old life is over
[1:29:21] there's no going back to plow tomorrow
[1:29:24] the oxen's Dead the instruments are dead
[1:29:28] he is fully going I'm King and I have to
[1:29:31] go fight there is no going back to the
[1:29:34] field like always
[1:29:36] he sends it out to all the nation and
[1:29:38] says either come
[1:29:41] or the same things happening to your
[1:29:43] fields and your animals and your oxen
[1:29:47] certainly happens to all of them unless
[1:29:48] you show up
[1:29:50] and so the entire nation
[1:29:55] comes to him
[1:29:57] and Saul leads them they fight
[1:30:01] and to keep it short they win
[1:30:04] they defeat this ammonite that's come in
[1:30:08] and so
[1:30:10] the next one
[1:30:11] and one of the ones that
[1:30:13] I think we always
[1:30:16] want to think about is that submission
[1:30:20] to proper headship
[1:30:21] brings protection
[1:30:26] Saul was the king
[1:30:28] the nation was to be in submission to
[1:30:31] him
[1:30:33] they had the right to call for
[1:30:35] protection to call for help the enemies
[1:30:38] upon us
[1:30:41] Saul hadn't even stepped in really to
[1:30:43] the role of King yet he was plowing the
[1:30:45] field but the call came we need help
[1:30:49] and then headship had a responsibility
[1:30:53] headship had a responsibility to come in
[1:30:55] and go
[1:30:56] they need protection
[1:30:59] a fight a battle needs to take place and
[1:31:02] it's my job to lead it it's my job to go
[1:31:06] into place
[1:31:09] let's turn to Joshua chapter 9.
[1:31:16] Joshua chapter 9 and we'll start at
[1:31:18] verse 3.
[1:31:21] and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard
[1:31:23] what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to
[1:31:26] AI they did work Wiley and they went and
[1:31:29] made as if they had been ambassadors and
[1:31:31] took old sacks upon their asses and wine
[1:31:33] bottles old and rent and bound up in old
[1:31:36] shoes and clouded upon their feet and
[1:31:39] old garments upon them and all the bread
[1:31:41] of their Provisions was dry and moldy
[1:31:44] and they went to Joshua unto the camp at
[1:31:47] gilgal and said in him and to the men of
[1:31:48] Israel we come from a far country now
[1:31:52] therefore making a league with us and
[1:31:55] the men of Israel said unto the hivites
[1:31:57] per Adventure ye dwell Among Us how
[1:31:59] shall we make a league with you and they
[1:32:00] said unto Joshua we are thy servants
[1:32:04] and Joshua said unto them who are ye and
[1:32:06] once Come Ye and they said unto him from
[1:32:08] a very far country thy servants are come
[1:32:10] because of the name of the Lord thy God
[1:32:12] for we have heard of the fame of him and
[1:32:14] all that he did in Egypt
[1:32:18] let's drop down to verse 22.
[1:32:24] and Joshua called for them and he spoke
[1:32:26] unto them saying wherefore have you
[1:32:27] beguiled us saying we are from very far
[1:32:30] from you when you dwell Among Us now
[1:32:32] therefore ye are cursed and there shall
[1:32:34] none of you be freed from being Bond men
[1:32:36] and humors of wood and drawers of water
[1:32:38] for the house of my God and the answer
[1:32:40] Joshua and said because it was certainly
[1:32:42] told thy servants how that the Lord thy
[1:32:44] God commanded his servant Moses to give
[1:32:46] you all the land and destroy all the
[1:32:48] inhabitants of the land from before you
[1:32:50] therefore we were so afraid of Our Lives
[1:32:53] because of you and have done this thing
[1:32:54] and now behold we are in thine hand as
[1:32:57] it seemeth good and right unto thee to
[1:32:58] do unto us do and so did he unto them
[1:33:01] and deliver them out of the hand of the
[1:33:03] children of Israel that they slew them
[1:33:05] not and Joshua made them that day heroes
[1:33:07] of wood and drawers of water for the
[1:33:09] congregation and for the altar of the
[1:33:11] Lord even unto this day in the place
[1:33:13] which he should choose
[1:33:17] so Israel has come in and they have
[1:33:19] destroyed Jericho and AI
[1:33:22] the message is going abroad
[1:33:25] Israel's basically Unstoppable at this
[1:33:27] point is what everyone's thinking
[1:33:31] and so
[1:33:34] the gibeonites are like okay we've got
[1:33:36] to try to save ourselves
[1:33:38] because we can't beat them in battle
[1:33:40] it's not going to happen
[1:33:42] and so they set up this deception and
[1:33:45] come here let us make this league with
[1:33:47] you
[1:33:49] and
[1:33:52] okay fine we'll make a league with you
[1:33:53] and then the deception is discovered
[1:33:56] Israel says how dare you
[1:33:58] and the people of Guild go
[1:34:01] we just don't want to die
[1:34:03] it's basically all we're looking for we
[1:34:05] just don't want to die so whatever you
[1:34:07] want to do with us as long as you're not
[1:34:08] killing us we're good with it
[1:34:10] we're willing to do whatever you want
[1:34:13] they were willing to come under
[1:34:14] submission
[1:34:16] and so Joshua goes fine you're going to
[1:34:18] be our servants you're going to be
[1:34:20] drawers of water and humors of wood for
[1:34:22] the uh for our God
[1:34:26] for the rest of time
[1:34:29] this is what you're doing and the men of
[1:34:30] gilgal go fine
[1:34:32] We're Not Dead
[1:34:33] we're better off than we thought we
[1:34:35] would be that's good enough for us
[1:34:38] I'm good being a servant
[1:34:40] okay
[1:34:42] then we go into Joshua chapter 10.
[1:34:48] and in Joshua chapter 10
[1:34:51] it's verse 1 it says now it came to pass
[1:34:53] when Adam nazedek king of Jerusalem had
[1:34:57] heard how Joshua had taken Ahi and it
[1:34:59] utterly destroyed it as he had done to
[1:35:01] Jericho and her King
[1:35:03] so he had done to Ai and her King and
[1:35:06] how the inhabitants of gibeon had made
[1:35:08] peace with Israel and were among them
[1:35:10] that they feared greatly because gibeon
[1:35:12] was a great city as one of the royal
[1:35:15] cities and because it was greater than
[1:35:17] Ai and all of the men thereof were
[1:35:19] mighty
[1:35:21] wherefore Adam isadek king of Jerusalem
[1:35:23] Senator hoem king of Hebron and under
[1:35:26] Purim king of jarmouth and unto jaffea
[1:35:28] king of lakish and unto Debra king of
[1:35:30] eglon saying come up unto me and help me
[1:35:32] that we may spite gibeon for it hath
[1:35:35] made peace with Joshua and with the
[1:35:36] children of Israel
[1:35:38] therefore the five Kings of the ant
[1:35:41] the five Kings of the amorites the king
[1:35:43] of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king
[1:35:44] of jarmouth the king of Lakers the king
[1:35:46] of Eglin gathered themselves together
[1:35:48] and went up they and all of their hosts
[1:35:51] and encamped before gibeon and may warn
[1:35:53] against it
[1:35:55] and the men of gibeon sent unto Joshua
[1:35:57] to the camp to gilgal saying slack not
[1:36:00] thy hand from thy servants come up to us
[1:36:02] quickly and save us and help us for all
[1:36:05] the king of the amorites that dwell in
[1:36:07] the mountains are gathered against us
[1:36:11] gilgal
[1:36:13] is now putting themselves as servants
[1:36:15] they have come under Authority
[1:36:19] we're your servants will do the job you
[1:36:22] tell us to do we'll do what you want
[1:36:24] the enemy goes well this isn't okay
[1:36:28] this this cannot be allowed we have to
[1:36:30] destroy them
[1:36:32] they come to fight against gilgal
[1:36:34] and gilgal sends the message to Joshua
[1:36:38] says
[1:36:40] we're your servants
[1:36:42] when I was talking earlier about in
[1:36:45] medieval times about how this was a
[1:36:46] two-way street
[1:36:48] this is the same thing
[1:36:50] they're going hey there's a two-way
[1:36:52] street here worse your servant will do
[1:36:54] whatever you want
[1:36:56] but you have to protect us
[1:36:58] this is the other part of
[1:37:01] we're here to serve you to meet your
[1:37:04] needs to do what you tell us but the
[1:37:07] enemy is attacking
[1:37:09] and now part of your responsibility
[1:37:13] part of your headship is to come fight
[1:37:16] and to protect us
[1:37:24] and go into verse eight
[1:37:27] and the Lord said unto Joshua fear them
[1:37:29] not for I have delivered them into thine
[1:37:31] hand there shall not a man of them stand
[1:37:33] before thee Joshua therefore came unto
[1:37:36] them suddenly and went up from gilgal
[1:37:38] all night and the Lord discomfitted them
[1:37:40] before Israel and slew them with a great
[1:37:42] Slaughter at gibeon and chased them
[1:37:44] along the way that goeth up to Beth are
[1:37:46] on and smote them to Attica and unto
[1:37:48] Mecca and it came to pass that they fled
[1:37:51] before Israel and were in going down to
[1:37:53] bethron that the Lord cast down great
[1:37:55] stones from Heaven upon them unto azica
[1:37:58] and they died they were more which died
[1:38:02] with hailstones and they whom the
[1:38:04] children of Israel slew with the sword
[1:38:09] so not only
[1:38:11] did they get protection from Joshua
[1:38:15] but God respected it God respected that
[1:38:18] they were willing to go look we just
[1:38:20] don't want to die we will be your
[1:38:22] servant we will do what you want
[1:38:24] Joshua comes to fight and then God goes
[1:38:27] I'm getting in on this
[1:38:28] and starts throwing rocks
[1:38:31] and when God throws a rock is over
[1:38:34] he throws down the hailstones and takes
[1:38:36] out more with the Rocks than the men of
[1:38:40] Israel did
[1:38:41] men of Israel killed people they took
[1:38:43] out some of the enemy but God took out
[1:38:45] way more than they did
[1:38:53] spake Joshua to the Lord and the day
[1:38:55] when the Lord delivered up the amorites
[1:38:57] before the children of Israel and he
[1:38:59] said in the sight of Israel son stand
[1:39:02] now still upon gibeon and thou moon in
[1:39:05] the valley of agilon and the sun Stood
[1:39:08] Still and the moon stayed until the
[1:39:10] people had Avenged themselves upon their
[1:39:12] enemies
[1:39:15] so not only
[1:39:18] is Joshua defending his servants
[1:39:22] but he goes so far as
[1:39:25] to go hey
[1:39:27] I'm not done
[1:39:29] son stopped there Moon stopped there
[1:39:32] there are more enemies that need to be
[1:39:33] defeated
[1:39:34] it's not good enough that we've gone
[1:39:36] this far
[1:39:37] the enemy can get away we've protected
[1:39:39] our servants no you attacked our
[1:39:41] servants you all have to go
[1:39:43] and so there was never a day like that
[1:39:47] the scriptures say that and there was no
[1:39:50] day like that before it or after that
[1:39:52] the Lord hearkened unto the voice of man
[1:39:54] for the Lord fought for Israel
[1:40:00] and this all started because they were
[1:40:01] out to protect
[1:40:03] some of the men that the original
[1:40:05] instruction was to destroy
[1:40:08] but those men were willing to give
[1:40:10] themselves under submission go
[1:40:13] we just don't want to die we'll be your
[1:40:15] servant we'll do whatever you want
[1:40:18] we're not trying to convince you to
[1:40:19] worship our gods or anything we'll
[1:40:21] we will serve your God we will bring the
[1:40:25] water we will Hew the wood we will do
[1:40:26] what we need to take care if that's what
[1:40:29] you want us to do
[1:40:32] will come under that submission
[1:40:36] and God had respect for that
[1:40:38] to the point where he would fight for
[1:40:40] Israel he would throw down the Rocks he
[1:40:43] would stop the Sun and Moon so that the
[1:40:45] enemy could be destroyed
[1:40:49] sir submission to the proper headship
[1:40:51] brings about protection
[1:40:59] I talked a little bit earlier about how
[1:41:01] it brings Authority and so
[1:41:04] the wives have a certain level of
[1:41:06] authority within the home
[1:41:09] but if
[1:41:11] sister Fresca and her Authority is
[1:41:13] dealing with a situation
[1:41:15] and someone is
[1:41:17] bothering her
[1:41:20] she has the right
[1:41:22] to turn to her head
[1:41:26] and say talk to him
[1:41:28] she has the right to take the person
[1:41:30] that's bothering her this issue
[1:41:33] and pass it on
[1:41:35] yeah go uh talk to my husband
[1:41:38] if someone is bothering my wife
[1:41:41] she doesn't have to handle it on her own
[1:41:44] God didn't put her at the head
[1:41:47] God put me at the head
[1:41:49] so if she has a problem that she can't
[1:41:52] handle or doesn't want to handle
[1:41:54] she has every right
[1:41:57] to say talk to Harry or to call me over
[1:42:00] to become the barrier between her and
[1:42:03] whatever the issue is
[1:42:06] she has that right every wife has that
[1:42:09] right to put the husband out in front
[1:42:11] and go you know what this
[1:42:14] salesman's getting a little too
[1:42:15] aggressive I don't want to deal with it
[1:42:17] anymore
[1:42:18] they're not wanting to hear no from me
[1:42:21] great talk to my husband
[1:42:24] I don't have to deal with this
[1:42:26] I have a head
[1:42:29] well guess what
[1:42:31] when Satan's getting like that with us
[1:42:34] and he keeps wanting to beat you over
[1:42:36] and he won't
[1:42:38] listen
[1:42:39] he won't accept it he keeps throwing it
[1:42:42] at you you keep going
[1:42:44] no by your stripes I'm Healed I don't
[1:42:46] accept that I don't accept that I don't
[1:42:48] accept that eventually you hit the point
[1:42:50] of going look talk to my head if you
[1:42:52] don't want to listen to me you don't
[1:42:54] want to listen to that talk to my head
[1:42:56] he's the one you have to deal with
[1:42:59] he's the one you have to go through talk
[1:43:01] to my husband
[1:43:03] go through him
[1:43:05] if you want to get to me
[1:43:07] in the church age book and the fellow
[1:43:09] different Church age it says when the
[1:43:11] bride has been committed to the groom
[1:43:12] she takes off her veil and places it
[1:43:15] over the groom's shoulder signifying
[1:43:17] that not only is she under his Dominion
[1:43:20] that she has transferred her rights to
[1:43:22] him that he is the head but also that he
[1:43:24] Bears the responsibility and the care
[1:43:27] and that he and he alone no one else no
[1:43:32] other man no other power has any right
[1:43:35] and responsibility and that beloved is
[1:43:38] the Key of David God being Sovereign he
[1:43:41] foreknew by Divine decree who would be
[1:43:44] in his bride he chose her she did not
[1:43:46] choose him he called her she did not
[1:43:49] come on her own he died for her he
[1:43:51] washed her in his own blood he paid the
[1:43:53] price for her she belongs to him and to
[1:43:56] him alone she is wholly committed to him
[1:43:59] and he accepts the obligation he is her
[1:44:02] head for Christ is the head of his
[1:44:03] church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even
[1:44:06] so the bride is happy that he is her
[1:44:09] Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is
[1:44:12] her Delight
[1:44:16] Psalms 24 and verse 8 says who is this
[1:44:19] king of glory the lord strong and mighty
[1:44:21] the Lord Mighty in battle
[1:44:25] okay
[1:44:27] brother Joe you're going into the doctor
[1:44:28] tomorrow for your lungs to get them
[1:44:30] checked again
[1:44:31] right
[1:44:34] okay
[1:44:35] you have the authority
[1:44:38] to tell them to go talk to your husband
[1:44:42] you have the authority where you don't
[1:44:44] have to stand there on your own you can
[1:44:45] go you know what
[1:44:47] talk to him
[1:44:49] you talk to Christ I don't have to deal
[1:44:52] with this
[1:44:53] it's not required of me I have a head
[1:44:55] that I can pass it on to
[1:44:58] I have a head who has the power
[1:45:01] who has
[1:45:03] all that they need for the victory who
[1:45:06] already has won the victory forget that
[1:45:09] can get the victory victory is already
[1:45:11] done
[1:45:13] and we have the right as the Bride of
[1:45:15] the Christ to
[1:45:17] pass it on to her husband
[1:45:19] we have the authority to deal with
[1:45:21] things
[1:45:22] we also have the ability to pass it on
[1:45:25] to our husband
[1:45:26] for the protection that he provides
[1:45:29] the same thing it is in the natural you
[1:45:32] know I have the same thing when it looks
[1:45:33] at it from a workplace standpoint
[1:45:36] I have a certain level of authority well
[1:45:38] part of that Authority is my job is to
[1:45:40] protect those underneath me
[1:45:42] if I have a if we have a customer that's
[1:45:45] come in that is extremely irate and all
[1:45:48] these kind of things my responsibility
[1:45:51] is to step between them and those under
[1:45:54] me and to take the brunt of it
[1:45:56] it's my responsibility to protect them
[1:46:01] I have this Authority but with the
[1:46:03] authority there's also this
[1:46:05] responsibility of protecting those under
[1:46:07] me to take care of them
[1:46:09] as a husband I'm the head of the home
[1:46:13] there's a level of authority I have but
[1:46:16] there's also a responsibility I have to
[1:46:18] protect my wife to protect my children
[1:46:22] not just in physical
[1:46:25] but to protect them emotionally to
[1:46:26] protect them spiritually I have a
[1:46:29] responsibility to do it not just an
[1:46:31] ability
[1:46:32] not just an ability to protect them but
[1:46:35] I have the responsibility to do it
[1:46:39] and we have the same thing as Christians
[1:46:41] where we have been granted this
[1:46:43] Authority
[1:46:46] but we are also able to turn it
[1:46:48] to our husband for protection
[1:46:52] and there's a responsibility there
[1:46:55] and Christ doesn't shirk his
[1:46:56] responsibility
[1:46:58] he's the ever-present help in time of
[1:47:01] trouble he's quick to step in he's quick
[1:47:03] to come in and be the Lord Mighty in
[1:47:07] battle
[1:47:12] the scripture I read earlier from Isaiah
[1:47:15] chapter 4.
[1:47:17] starting at verse 1 it says in that day
[1:47:19] seven women shall take hold of one man
[1:47:21] saying we shall eat our own bread and
[1:47:23] wear our own apparel only let us be
[1:47:25] called by thy name to take away our
[1:47:26] approach
[1:47:28] that sounds a lot like the world that's
[1:47:29] going on around us
[1:47:32] but the rest of the chapter is beautiful
[1:47:35] verse two and in that day shall the
[1:47:37] branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[1:47:38] glorious
[1:47:39] and the fruit of the Earth shall be
[1:47:41] excellent and comely for them that are
[1:47:43] escaped of Israel and are succumbed to
[1:47:45] pass that he that is left in Zion and he
[1:47:48] that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be
[1:47:50] Called holy
[1:47:52] even everyone that is written among the
[1:47:54] living in Jerusalem
[1:47:56] and we know that Zion
[1:47:59] brother Brandon taught us Zion can also
[1:48:01] be you can put the bride there
[1:48:03] you can put bride in in place of Zion
[1:48:06] and so
[1:48:08] and it shall come to pass that he that
[1:48:10] is left in the bride and he that
[1:48:12] remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called
[1:48:13] holy even everyone that is written among
[1:48:16] the living in Jerusalem when the Lord
[1:48:19] shall have washed away the filth of the
[1:48:21] daughters of Zion and shall have purged
[1:48:24] the blood of Jerusalem from the midst
[1:48:25] thereof by the spirit of judgment and by
[1:48:27] the spirit of burning and the Lord will
[1:48:30] create upon every Dwelling Place of
[1:48:32] Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a
[1:48:35] cloud and smoke by day and The Shining
[1:48:38] of a flaming fire by night for upon all
[1:48:41] the glory shall be a defense and there
[1:48:44] shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in
[1:48:46] the daytime from the Heat and for a
[1:48:48] place of refuge and for a covert from
[1:48:50] the storm and from rain
[1:49:01] during the same time
[1:49:04] that you have all these people that just
[1:49:06] want to take on the husband's name to
[1:49:08] take away their approach but they don't
[1:49:09] want to do
[1:49:11] what he wants them to do they just want
[1:49:13] to do their own thing still not be under
[1:49:15] submission at the same time
[1:49:19] here's God saying but my children
[1:49:25] the branch of the Lord shall be
[1:49:27] beautiful and glorious
[1:49:30] and the fruit of the Earth shall be
[1:49:32] excellent and comely for them that are
[1:49:34] escaped of Israel
[1:49:39] and in verse 5 and the Lord will create
[1:49:40] upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion
[1:49:42] and upon her assembly is a cloud and
[1:49:44] smoke by day and The Shining of a
[1:49:46] flaming fire by night for upon all the
[1:49:49] glory shall be a defense
[1:49:54] everyone
[1:49:56] doesn't want what God wants to offer
[1:49:59] them
[1:49:59] they want to do their own thing
[1:50:02] brother random talked about the fact
[1:50:03] that that applies to the dominations
[1:50:05] that they want to have the the name of
[1:50:07] Christian they want to have the name of
[1:50:09] Christ but not come under submission
[1:50:11] but yet here God
[1:50:14] through the prophet Isaiah is writing
[1:50:16] and saying but at that same time
[1:50:19] during the same time that you're seeing
[1:50:20] that happen everywhere
[1:50:23] I'm going to be the one providing
[1:50:24] defense
[1:50:26] I'm going to be the one providing the
[1:50:27] defense providing the protection
[1:50:30] for mine
[1:50:32] for my bride
[1:50:41] in the future home of the Heavenly
[1:50:43] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[1:50:46] it says oh pray the Lord Jesus watch
[1:50:48] here how the words cannot fail now watch
[1:50:50] here in Isaiah I got it wrote down here
[1:50:51] if I can find again just a minute
[1:50:54] now listen he's talking of the coming of
[1:50:56] the Lord
[1:50:57] how the woman would be so immoral and in
[1:50:59] that day seven women shall take hold of
[1:51:01] one man saying we'll eat our own bread
[1:51:02] where our own apparel and let us be
[1:51:04] called by thy name to take away our
[1:51:05] approach that's the end time where we're
[1:51:07] living now marriage divorce prostitution
[1:51:09] whatever and that day shall the branch
[1:51:11] of the Lord be beautiful and glorious
[1:51:13] the fruit of the Earth shall be
[1:51:15] excellent and cumbling The Escape of
[1:51:18] Israel how that you escaped all that
[1:51:19] damnation see and it shall come to pass
[1:51:21] that he that is left in Zion and that's
[1:51:24] a Remnant in Jerusalem in Jerusalem
[1:51:26] Shall be Called holy even everyone that
[1:51:29] is written among the living in Jerusalem
[1:51:31] see where in the Lord shall have washed
[1:51:33] away the filth of the daughters of Zion
[1:51:35] remember that's always the bride see and
[1:51:38] shall have purified the blood of
[1:51:39] Jerusalem that's the remnant of the Jews
[1:51:41] plus the bride and in the midst thereof
[1:51:43] with the spirit of judgment fire that's
[1:51:45] always God's judgment when he makes his
[1:51:47] final judgment calls you justifies you
[1:51:50] and brings you to Redemption then his
[1:51:52] judgment breaks forth upon you and the
[1:51:54] Holy Ghost and Fire cleanses away the
[1:51:56] sin then you're his same thing he does
[1:51:58] to the earth when he purges it with fire
[1:52:00] and by the spirit of burning now look
[1:52:02] listen are you ready and the Lord will
[1:52:04] create upon every Dwelling Place of
[1:52:06] Mount Zion and upon her assembly a cloud
[1:52:08] of smoke by day a shining of Fire by a
[1:52:10] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[1:52:13] defense the Lord in that day upon the
[1:52:16] top of it shall create a fire of light
[1:52:17] to burn upon the day and it goes and

[1:52:30] he'll create this light upon this
[1:52:32] mountain and it shall be for a defense
[1:52:37] psalm 91.
[1:52:40] starting at verse 1.
[1:52:44] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:52:46] the most high shall abide under the
[1:52:48] shadow of the Almighty
[1:52:49] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[1:52:51] and my Fortress my God and him will I
[1:52:54] trust
[1:52:55] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[1:52:57] Snare of the Fowler and from the noise

[1:53:02] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[1:53:05] truth shall be thy shield and Buckler
[1:53:07] thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[1:53:09] by night nor for the arrow that flyeth
[1:53:11] by day nor for the pestilence that
[1:53:14] walketh in darkness nor for the
[1:53:15] destruction that wasteth in Noonday A
[1:53:18] thousand shall follow thy side and ten
[1:53:20] thousand at thy right hand but it shall
[1:53:22] not come nigh thee Only With Thine Eyes
[1:53:24] shall thou behold and see the reward of
[1:53:26] the wicked because thou has made the
[1:53:28] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[1:53:30] high thy habitation
[1:53:32] there shall be no evil befall thee
[1:53:34] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[1:53:36] dwelling for he shall give his angels
[1:53:38] charge over there to keep thee in all
[1:53:40] thy ways Thou shalt bear thee up in
[1:53:42] their hands lest thou Dash thy foot
[1:53:44] against a stone Thou shalt tread upon
[1:53:46] the lion and Adder the Young Lion and
[1:53:48] the dragon shalt thou trample on her
[1:53:50] feet because he had set his love upon me
[1:53:53] therefore will I deliver him I will set
[1:53:55] him on high because he hath known my
[1:53:57] name he shall call upon me and I will
[1:53:59] answer him I will be with him in trouble
[1:54:01] I will deliver him and honor him with
[1:54:03] long life will I satisfy him and show
[1:54:06] him my salvation
[1:54:10] as the musicians go ahead and come
[1:54:14] in the sermon letting off the pressure
[1:54:15] brother random says if you're all
[1:54:17] pressured up and you don't know where
[1:54:19] you're going what's going to happen to
[1:54:21] you after death and you know you're
[1:54:22] going to die sometime you've got to do
[1:54:24] then the thing to come is come to Christ
[1:54:27] The Refuge and let off the pressure
[1:54:29] settle once for all no matter what takes
[1:54:31] place Christ is our refuge and when we
[1:54:34] come to him we can let off the pressure
[1:54:35] you can quit worrying about well if I
[1:54:37] die what's going to happen to me what's
[1:54:39] going to happen to the wife what's going
[1:54:41] to happen to the husband what's going to
[1:54:42] happen to the children
[1:54:43] just come to Christ and let off the
[1:54:45] pressure
[1:54:46] he gives us all things all things are
[1:54:48] ours by Christ so just let the pressure
[1:54:50] off the only way you can do it
[1:54:52] somebody might give you a million
[1:54:54] dollars it would build up pressure
[1:54:56] you might join a church and it would
[1:54:58] still build up pressure
[1:55:00] because the Methodist will tell you
[1:55:01] they're right and the Baptist is wrong
[1:55:03] and the Baptists say they're wrong and
[1:55:04] we're right so it just builds up more
[1:55:06] pressure because you don't know where
[1:55:08] you're standing
[1:55:09] but if you ever come to Christ you can
[1:55:11] let off the pressure because it's all
[1:55:12] over then just settle it down it's God's
[1:55:15] provided place of safety where God said
[1:55:18] the name of the Lord is a mighty tower
[1:55:19] the righteous run into and are safe
[1:55:21] in a time of sickness when sickness
[1:55:23] strikes and the doctor says there's
[1:55:24] nothing else I can do about it don't
[1:55:26] build up pressure let off the pressure
[1:55:29] call your pastor let him anoint you in
[1:55:30] oil and pray over you the prayer of
[1:55:33] faith shall save the sick let off the
[1:55:34] pressure see
[1:55:35] he's our refuge while you're in this
[1:55:37] Refuge you got you got the right to
[1:55:39] anything that's in the Refuge and Christ
[1:55:42] is our refuge and everything you have
[1:55:43] need of is in him Amen in sickness don't
[1:55:46] build up pressure let off pressure
[1:55:48] you say well I wonder brother Branham
[1:55:50] you don't wonder you just let the
[1:55:51] pressure off commit your case to God and
[1:55:53] go on as if it was all over
[1:55:55] don't build up pressure it lets off
[1:55:57] pressure
[1:55:58] well you say I'm so worried brother
[1:56:00] Branham I just don't know let off the
[1:56:02] pressure Amen in the City of Refuge he
[1:56:05] took your worry so you don't have to
[1:56:06] have it
[1:56:07] cast your cares on him for we careth for
[1:56:09] you
[1:56:10] don't you worry about your cares that's
[1:56:13] his business
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:18] in a world where
[1:56:20] submission is so often looked down upon
[1:56:23] and the world fights against the idea of
[1:56:26] being under submission and and having to
[1:56:29] do what someone else is telling them to
[1:56:31] do
[1:56:31] they tell everyone that your destiny is
[1:56:34] in your own hands you can do it all
[1:56:36] yourself you can pull yourself up by
[1:56:38] your bootstrap take all whatever cliched
[1:56:40] comment you want to come up with and go
[1:56:43] you can do it on your own you don't need
[1:56:46] anybody
[1:56:47] we as Christians are called to be under
[1:56:50] submission
[1:56:52] we're called to go against how the world
[1:56:55] wants to teach us we're called to go
[1:56:57] against what the world wants to do and
[1:56:59] say no we're supposed to be under
[1:57:00] submission
[1:57:02] and yes that means that the woman is
[1:57:05] under submission to her husband yes
[1:57:07] we're not preaching on that today so
[1:57:09] we're not worried about it
[1:57:11] the man's under submission to Christ
[1:57:15] we're in these places and when we're
[1:57:18] under submission
[1:57:20] there are these blessings that come with
[1:57:22] it and I only touched on three
[1:57:25] I only went into these three areas
[1:57:28] submission grants provision
[1:57:31] God will provide Jehovah Jireh God
[1:57:34] provides our needs
[1:57:37] submission
[1:57:39] and headship often grants Authority
[1:57:42] we know that Christ is the power
[1:57:46] but he's given us the authority the
[1:57:49] authority to tell Satan to leave the
[1:57:51] authority to tell the spirits not to be
[1:57:53] in our home the authority to send back
[1:57:56] the box of rattlesnakes and not accept
[1:57:58] it
[1:58:00] and that submission
[1:58:03] provides protection
[1:58:06] we don't have to deal with it
[1:58:09] the same way that my wife has every
[1:58:11] right to send someone to talk to me
[1:58:13] instead of her
[1:58:15] the same right that she has to step
[1:58:18] behind me and go
[1:58:19] he's my head you deal with him
[1:58:24] we have that same right
[1:58:26] we have the authority to handle it we
[1:58:29] have the authority to stand against what
[1:58:31] Satan's throwing at us
[1:58:34] but when we keep fighting and when we
[1:58:38] keep facing it over and over and we
[1:58:40] start to get a little tired and we start
[1:58:42] to get where maybe we can't quite stand
[1:58:44] on her anymore we have the right
[1:58:47] to say talk to my husband
[1:58:51] I can't fight so much anymore
[1:58:54] I've gotten tired
[1:58:57] I've been dealing with this battle for
[1:58:59] too long
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:02] whether it's
[1:59:04] a disease we've been dealing with
[1:59:07] some physical malady
[1:59:09] or maybe it's
[1:59:11] something on the spiritual side that
[1:59:12] we've been struggling with
[1:59:14] and we can't seem to get past
[1:59:19] I have the authority
[1:59:22] but I also have the right
[1:59:25] to send it to my husband
[1:59:27] and say that's my headship you talk to
[1:59:31] him
[1:59:33] Satan you have to go through him to get
[1:59:36] to me
[1:59:38] [Music]
[1:59:40] submission is not a bad thing
[1:59:42] it's not something that like the world
[1:59:45] wants to put out there
[1:59:47] that is no we have to do it our own we
[1:59:49] have to be able to stand up and be
[1:59:52] strong and do all these different things
[1:59:55] it's okay to have a song leader that
[1:59:57] cries while he's up here to have a
[1:59:59] worship leader that's able to feel the
[2:00:01] leading of the Lord and let some tears
[2:00:03] out
[2:00:04] it's okay as men that we cry
[2:00:07] occasionally
[2:00:08] there's nothing wrong with this
[2:00:14] because we're allowed to be in
[2:00:16] submission or allowed to turn it over to
[2:00:19] our Heavenly Father to our husband to go
[2:00:22] Lord I I know you've given me the
[2:00:24] authority to handle it
[2:00:25] [Music]
[2:00:27] but I'm tired I'm worn out
[2:00:31] Satan has bothered me for so long
[2:00:34] that I don't feel that I can handle it
[2:00:38] but Lord I can turn it over to you
[2:00:41] and I can let you step in front
[2:00:44] and I can let you show yourself as the
[2:00:46] one Mighty in battle again
[2:00:51] you want to see a husband get riled up
[2:00:53] have someone mess with his wife a little
[2:00:54] bit
[2:00:57] you want to see the husband get mad at
[2:00:58] the kids have the kids upset mama
[2:01:01] then you'll see Daddy get upset more
[2:01:03] than normal
[2:01:05] it's like you could have the dad that's
[2:01:06] the most calm in the world
[2:01:09] but you get Mom upset
[2:01:10] suddenly dad's upset
[2:01:15] because that's my girl back there
[2:01:19] someone gets her upset
[2:01:22] that's not acceptable
[2:01:25] and if that's what I can do as an
[2:01:27] Earthly husband
[2:01:28] if that's how I want to react as an
[2:01:31] Earthly Fallen man
[2:01:35] how much more
[2:01:37] is Christ acting that way
[2:01:40] when Satan keeps going after his wife
[2:01:44] and keeps bothering her
[2:01:46] and keeps pressing her and getting her
[2:01:48] all worried and getting her all upset
[2:01:50] and getting her all stressed and getting
[2:01:53] her all worked up
[2:01:57] how much more does our
[2:01:59] Heavenly Father our Heavenly husband
[2:02:02] want to step in
[2:02:04] and go
[2:02:06] you got to get through me
[2:02:07] you have to talk to me now
[2:02:11] submission isn't a sign of weakness
[2:02:13] submission isn't a sign that we're less
[2:02:17] than what we should be
[2:02:20] which is how the world wants to portray
[2:02:22] it
[2:02:23] submission is part of our calling
[2:02:26] it's part of how we were created we were
[2:02:29] designed to worship we were designed to
[2:02:31] submit to our creator
[2:02:33] foreign
[2:02:35] to try to do it our own we weren't
[2:02:37] designed to follow after Lucifer to
[2:02:41] create my own kingdom
[2:02:43] we were designed to worship and submit
[2:02:47] to the Creator
[2:02:50] and so whatever each one of us is facing
[2:02:52] whatever trials we may be going through
[2:02:54] whatever concerns they are whatever
[2:02:56] worries or nagging at the back of our
[2:02:59] mind
[2:03:01] whether it's something in the Physical
[2:03:02] Realm with our bodies with our with
[2:03:05] sickness with finances with whatever it
[2:03:08] might be
[2:03:11] there's still the headship
[2:03:14] where God will give us provision
[2:03:18] God will
[2:03:20] give us Authority
[2:03:22] God will give us protection
[2:03:25] when we submit to him
[2:03:28] when we're willing to give up that
[2:03:30] desire to deal with it on our own when
[2:03:32] we're willing to surrender
[2:03:35] when we're willing to come and swear
[2:03:38] fealty
[2:03:40] and I don't know if y'all paid attention
[2:03:42] in the way as I was describing when
[2:03:44] someone would come to swear fealty
[2:03:47] they went down on their knees and they
[2:03:49] put their hands in front of them
[2:03:53] does this remind anyone of anything
[2:03:57] all of us have been in this position
[2:03:59] before at this altar
[2:04:01] or in our own places at home
[2:04:03] where we're in the exact same position
[2:04:05] before God
[2:04:07] and we're down and we're in the position
[2:04:10] of fealty and we're surrendering to him
[2:04:15] and we're saying Lord
[2:04:18] I just want to do what you want me to do
[2:04:20] I just want
[2:04:22] to follow
[2:04:24] your guiding I just want to follow your
[2:04:26] leading
[2:04:28] I'm willing to give up my desires
[2:04:32] to surrender to you
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:37] and yes it's a two-way there's there's a
[2:04:40] give and take here
[2:04:41] we get blessings from it when we
[2:04:43] surrender when we submit when we give
[2:04:46] ourselves over there are blessings that
[2:04:48] we have access to
[2:04:50] [Music]
[2:04:53] but we don't do it for the blessings
[2:04:56] yes I love the blessings and yes I want
[2:04:58] them but I don't do it for that
[2:05:01] I do it because I'm in love
[2:05:03] with my creator
[2:05:05] and I want to please him and I want to
[2:05:08] give him what he wants
[2:05:12] and I'm yes I want him to help me
[2:05:15] overcome the things in my life that he
[2:05:17] doesn't like and I want to help him over
[2:05:20] help me overcome the things that are
[2:05:23] keeping me away from him
[2:05:26] I want to surrender
[2:05:30] and then God
[2:05:32] will take care of the rest
[2:05:37] brother Colby what are we singing
[2:05:39] [Music]
[2:05:49] let's all stand in worship for a moment
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:06:14] and bow my knees
[2:06:18] and worship
[2:06:21] and your throne
[2:06:25] I need you Lord
[2:06:28] I need you Lord
[2:06:32] right now
[2:06:36] I don't know if there's anyone else that
[2:06:37] maybe
[2:06:40] maybe you need to take some time to
[2:06:43] to be down in prayer and be returning to
[2:06:46] that state of fealty with your creator
[2:06:50] maybe you've done it recently maybe
[2:06:52] you've been in your prayer closet and
[2:06:53] you've been there maybe you've been here
[2:06:56] at this Altar and done it recently but
[2:06:58] if it's been a while if there are things
[2:07:01] that have begun to crop up in your life
[2:07:05] the altar's open the Pew where your at's
[2:07:07] open
[2:07:09] the position
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:12] a fealty is still available to us
[2:07:16] we're still able to come before him and
[2:07:19] surrender afresh
[2:07:21] and come in and go Lord maybe I made a
[2:07:24] mistake maybe I messed up somewhere
[2:07:26] but I can
[2:07:28] come back before you and I can confess
[2:07:31] I can bring it back unto your blood
[2:07:35] and you can take control again

[2:26:58] you are coming under his headship
[2:27:01] man that goes for anything did it
[2:27:03] man as a minister
[2:27:05] I'm not responsible for cleaning anybody
[2:27:08] up I'm not responsible for
[2:27:10] for anyone
[2:27:13] I can't make you a Christian I can't I
[2:27:15] can't keep you out
[2:27:17] my responsibility
[2:27:20] amen my authority is in the word
[2:27:23] and to preach that word
[2:27:26] if you choose not to follow it
[2:27:29] that's between you and him
[2:27:31] I still get paid the same from him at
[2:27:34] the end of the day can you say Amen
[2:27:37] I just want to make sure that I'm
[2:27:40] pleasing to him
[2:27:42] is that right and that's the way we do
[2:27:44] it with one another at the Apostle Paul
[2:27:46] was telling I believe the colossian
[2:27:49] church he's telling he's when you serve
[2:27:51] when you're when you're under the
[2:27:53] authority of your boss
[2:27:55] he said don't do it as men Pleasers
[2:27:58] do it as unto the Lord
[2:28:00] then it doesn't matter doesn't matter
[2:28:03] what goes on and what you're going to
[2:28:06] get paid from him at the end of the day
[2:28:09] just serve him
[2:28:12] Oh Glory to God so it takes the loan off
[2:28:16] of you when you just simply say Lord
[2:28:20] I want to be submissive to you
[2:28:23] I want to be submissive
[2:28:27] just want to follow him and Lord Give Me
[2:28:29] a Heart
[2:28:31] a heart be pleased and I like I I hadn't
[2:28:36] heard that in a while amen uh the the
[2:28:39] men of gibeon and uh uh the Lord says I
[2:28:44] want to get involved on this one and he
[2:28:47] starts throwing rocks amen I like that
[2:28:50] praise the Lord God this is he knows how
[2:28:53] to he knows how to fight for his people
[2:28:55] doesn't he that's right he does he does
[2:28:58] but the main thing is I'm keeping my end
[2:29:01] of the deal in subjection to him
[2:29:04] he tells Abraham now listen
[2:29:08] I've called you
[2:29:10] and I want you to stay separate from
[2:29:12] your family get separate from your
[2:29:13] family Abraham didn't do that and God
[2:29:16] didn't appear to Abraham again
[2:29:19] until after he separated from lot

[2:29:25] say Lord
[2:29:26] let this
[2:29:28] voice let let that let that shout have
[2:29:33] such an effect upon my life let that
