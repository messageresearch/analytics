If you have your Bibles tonight, turn with me to Oh, there's I didn't see that hook over here. So, have your Bibles tonight if you want to turn with us to the book of Well, I was had this little thought on my mind. I was going to read from the book of St. Luke's gospel and and so but uh I just uh if you and I I had this scripture that I had put down but it seemed to lost it. I should have marked it but anyway was when Jesus come riding through uh Jerusalem remember and they was he was riding there and I I knew it was in Matthew but I I couldn't find it right now but he came riding through Jerusalem and they started praising him. Remember they started praising him. they uh you know cuz he went and told him to loose the that coat you know and all that and just uh he went into the temple and praising him and everything and so and and so Luke when he first got up here the first song he he was uh had sung was I got a right to praise him &gt;&gt; is that right &gt;&gt; pull that song up that that little that song there you know and &gt;&gt; hallelujah says I got a right to praise the Lord Yeah, &gt;&gt; I got a right to live my voice. Ain't nobody got a right &gt;&gt; like the children of the Lord &gt;&gt; who've seen the light. I've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb and I got a right. &gt;&gt; How many believe you got a right tonight &gt;&gt; to praise him? You got a right to lift your voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got a right to to to worship him. You got a right to raise your hands. You got a right to praise him. Did somebody find that scripture? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think it's in St. M was St. Matthew's one of them. And I think uh St. Mark 11. I can't remember just all where they're at, but if you if somebody got that scripture just hand it's I know it's in St. Matthew, one of them when he came right in there. And just just bear with me. Amen. And try not to I ain't going to try to hold you too long. I got a three-hour sermon. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's just the inside joke. So, you know, so but anyway, we just uh so he come right in there, you know, he told him to go and loose the coat. Anybody ask for it till the Lord has need of them, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; Matthew 21. &gt;&gt; Matthew 21. Thank you. There. Matthew 21. And let's just let's just uh read that. Start with Matthew verse chapter 21 verse one. and said, "And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Beth, Bethage, unto the Mount of Olives, it says that that they then sent Jesus to two disciples, saying unto them, go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find and ass tithe and a coat with her. Loose them, and bring them unto me." And if any man say ought unto you, you shall say, "The Lord hath need of them." and straightway he will send them. All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, "Tell ye the daughters of Zion, Behold, the king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt, the full of an ass, and his disciples and would went and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they sent him their own. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way." Can you imagine? And there they were. They were taking their garments, took that old suit coat, maybe spreading it away cuz the Lord was coming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "And they and the spread their garments in the way. Others cast down branch, cut down branches from the trees and stro them in the way." My, they just doing everything they could, &gt;&gt; couldn't they? And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried, saying, "Hosana to the son of David. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest. And when he come into the Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, "Who is this?" And the multitude said, "This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee." May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word. You may be seated. And I was thinking as brother Luke was leading that s that song there and I just uh happened to think of this quote and if I can uh pull it up. Hallelujah. It would I just thinking about it and and here's I want you to listen to this real quick and this is maybe where I want to draw my thoughts from if I can tonight if it'd be all right. &gt;&gt; Sorry I had sent brother Nathaniel something but it just seemed like this just just uh spoke to me. &gt;&gt; Listen what he said. This is in the message faith is a substance 1947. He said, "Listen, not long ago, I was over in Illinois, and listen, while we're talking of the colored, this come on my mind." He said, "I was in a big coliseum. Many of you know where I'm speaking of. And they're looking around and seeing different things. I seen a no colored man with a little ring of white hair around his head." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; He come along like this looking. And after a while, he came to a certain thing. He stopped, took his head off, he held it behind him, he bowed his head, and I seen he was saying a prayer. So, can you imagine who he was? Brother said he's in this museum walking around looking at different things. And I I like to go museum museums and look at different things. And he seen he said he seen this colored man and said he seen him and said he was looking in this little window there and he took his hat hat off and just uh begin to uh uh uh about took his hat off, put it behind him, begin to pray. &gt;&gt; So brother said wonder what that was about. You know, he said yeah said I raised up looked over there and he looked like this little he said uh I walked up at him. He got through praying. I said, "Sir," I said, "I'm a minister." I said, "I seen you praying. What's so startling about the box?" He looked up at me, his poor old wrinkle, hardened cheeks and tears rolling off the side of his cheeks. He said, "Reverend Parson." He said, "Just look over there." I raised up and looked over there and it looked like a little old dress laying there. I said, "I only see a dress." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what many people just see, the natural signs." Yeah. &gt;&gt; I said, "I only see the dress." See, a lot of people come to church tonight and they say, "Wonder what's wrong with them people?" They're raising their hands. They're praising God. They're they're they're they're just giving him glory and worship and and and they they may not be uh uh uh uh running around or whatever, but they're just saying there some people may just be tears be streaming down their eyes and they're wondering what's the matter. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with these people? Hey, you go somewhere and you probably what's wrong with a certain person? I you know I I walked up brother Miguel to a lot of people and said maybe I said hey listen I I noticed you crying or whatever I'm a minister can I help you? Is there anything wrong and they they'll tell you maybe their problem or whatever it is. Now listen I thought that was neat how he just walked up there and he says he said told them about the dress and everything said I only see a dress. I just see the natural things. People just see the natural things but they don't know really what's going on. &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "You notice that that that kind of a circle in it, Parson?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Feel right here on my side." He said, "That's is a mark of a slave belt." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the blood of Abraham Lincoln." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He said, "It took the slave belt off of me. Why shouldn't I take my hat off and say a prayer?" &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, WHY SHOULDN'T I COME INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD TONIGHT AND RAISE MY HANDS AND GIVE HIM GLORY? BECAUSE I HAD A SLAVE BELT ASS ON ME ONE TIME AND ALMIGHTY GOD TOOK IT OFF. &gt;&gt; SO I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM. I GOT A RIGHT TO LIFT MY VOICE. I GOT A RIGHT TO SHOUT TONIGHT. I GOT A RIGHT TO DANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why shouldn't I take my head off and say a prayer?" So he said, "I think tonight if a colored man from the freedom of his right could take his ad off to the blood of Abraham Lincoln, what are Christians to do to the blood of Jesus Christ?" &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WHAT should we do TONIGHT ABOUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST? IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM TONIGHT, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT. IF IT WASN'T FOR HIS GRACE, YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE. I WOULDN'T BE HERE. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS GRACE, BECAUSE OF HIM GOING TO CALVARY AND TAKING MY PLACE, THEN I'M HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a right to give him praise. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you tonight? &gt;&gt; Don't you have a right to give him praise? &gt;&gt; Don't you have a right to give him glory? &gt;&gt; Hey, because if it wasn't for you or him, I mean, going to Calvary, taking your place. Hallelujah. I'm glad that the prophet explained that to me. How that the evil over there in Hebrews said that he he didn't become an angel, but he took on the form of flesh, the form of human being, TO BE TESTED AND TRIED LIKE ME AND YOU ARE, TO KNOW WHAT WE FEEL, to know what we go through, SO HE COULD BE A HIGH PRIEST THAT COULD BE TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES. OH, WE HAVE A HIGH PRIEST TONIGHT THAT CAN BE TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES. WHEN WE'RE GOING THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE HARD TO BEAR, HE KNOWS WHAT WE FEEL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN WE'RE TEMPTED, HE KNOWS HOW WE FEEL CUZ HE WAS TEMPTED. &gt;&gt; YEAH, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; When we're sick, he knows how we feel because he was sick. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Is that right, &gt;&gt; sir? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad he became one of us so that we could become him. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brown said he would he came and became homeless that I might have a home. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He became homeless that I might have a home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He who knew no sin became sin. right? &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he knows how I feel. He stooped so that I could be lifted up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, he knows just how we feel. You remember when he came to that widow, Amen. or that woman, Amen, that was caught, they brought him threw her at his feet and said she was caught in the very act of adultery. What do you say? The law of Moses said she ought TO BE STONED. WHAT DO YOU SAY? THE BIBLE says he stooped. Hallelujah. He stooped. HE BECAME ME THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM. WHEN I COULDN'T COME TO WHERE HE WAS, HE CAME TO ME. HALLELUJAH. WHEN I COULDN'T GET UP TO WHERE HE WAS, HE STOOPED THAT I MIGHT BE lifted up. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. ANYHOW, I'M SO GLAD TONIGHT. AMEN. THAT HE became me. THAT HE COULD FEEL WHAT I FEEL, WHAT I GO THROUGH, WHEN I'M TEMPTED and tested. He was tempted and tested so he could be a faithful high priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I CAN IMAGINE HOW THE PROPHET OF God begin, you know, to to see this uh uh uh man here, how he was crying and everything went over to him. One place he called him said he called him uncle. You know how he is. And he said, "Hey, what's the matter?" He said, "I'm a minister. I'm a par. I I I I'm this. And you know, oh what he said, he said, you look over there, you see the you see that dress, you see that spot on that dress? Said that's the blood of Abraham Lincoln. I'LL FEEL MY SIDE. THAT'S THE MARK OF A SLAVE BELT. BUT THAT BLOOD OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN TOOK THAT SLAVE BELT OFF OF ME. AND NOW I'M HERE UH GIVING HONOR to what Abraham Lincoln DID THAT I MIGHT CAN GO FREE. NOW WHAT ABOUT US TONIGHT? I'M HERE TONIGHT TO GIVE HONOR TO THE ONE THAT SET ME FREE FROM ALL MY PAINS, ALL MY DISAPPOINTMENTS. HE SET ME FREE FROM EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that he set me free. &gt;&gt; So, I got a right to praise him. &gt;&gt; I got a right to live my to lift my voice. I got a right to shout. I got a right to say, "God, I love you tonight." I got a right to tell him how much I loved him, HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE HIM.

Don't you appreciate him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I appreciate him. I appreciate him so much. Oh, he's been so good. Now, listen. I looked this up just here quickly before I came out. It said Abraham's position on Abraham Lincoln's position on slavery in the United States is one of the most discussed aspects of his life. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Is that Lincoln Lincoln frankly expressed his moral opposition to slavery. In other words, he he discussed it a lot of times. His opposition, how that he despised it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think brother Brand said he hit his fist when he saw a a slave being sold. He said, "If I have to give my my blood, I'll I I'll give it." Trying to set those people free. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he gave his blood. In fact, he was called the great emancip or the the the great emancipator. &gt;&gt; But you know what? There's one that's greater than him tonight. That's the Lord Jesus Christ. And if Abraham LINCOLN WAS CALLED THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR, I BELIEVE HE'S CALLED THE GREAT GREAT EMANCIPATOR TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WAS JUST CALLED THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR BECAUSE HE SET THE SLAVES FREE. WHAT ABOUT US TONIGHT? OH, I'M WORSHIPING THE GREAT GREAT EMANCIPATOR BECAUSE HE SET MY SOUL FREE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It said however the question of what to do about it and how to end it given that it was so firmly embedded in the nation's constitutional framework and in the e economy of much of this of the country even though consecrated concentrated in it only in the southern United States was complex and politically challenge challenging there was also the question which Lincoln had to deal with of what would become of the 4 million slaves. leaves. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What would become of them? Oh, what about me and you tonight? WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF US? I TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF US. HALLELUJAH. WE GOT A HOME IN GLORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, they've got JUST HAD A HOME DOWN HERE AND COULD GO WALK AWAY FREE. OH, REMEMBER ON THE JUBILEE YEAR, THEY COULD THROW DOWN THEIR HOLE AND WALK OFF. AND AMEN. BECAUSE WHY? THEY WERE FREE. THEY HEARD THE JUBILEE SOUND AND THEY COULD GO FREE. BUT IF THEY WAS CONTENTED WITH THEIR SLAVE MASTER, THEY COULD SAY, "HEY, I WANT TO STAY HERE AND SERVE MY SLAVE MASTER AND THEY GO BEFORE THE PUBLIC AND GET THEIR EARBOARD THROUGH." &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And they'd remain a slave the rest of their lives. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; It was actually up to them whether they wanted to remain a slave or not. What about us tonight? What do we want to remain? A slave to the world or freedom in Christ? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's up to us. &gt;&gt; He He's laying it before you tonight. You can go free or you can hey be stay right where you are and become a a a slave to the things of the world and to the devil for the rest of your life. I WANT TO SAY HEY LISTEN LORD I WANT TO GO FREE. &gt;&gt; LOCK ME UP IN A PRISON AND THROW THE KEY AWAY. DEPRIVE ME OF THE FEUD FOOD I EAT. EVEN BIND MY HANDS AND FEET. BUT AS LONG AS I GOT HIM, &gt;&gt; I CAN STILL go free. &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I GOT HIM TONIGHT, I CAN STILL GO FREE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I can still go free tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just thank God for freedom. I thank God for a right to worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank God that I can come. Hey, I thank God, brother Wendle, that I can go to a church of my choice and worship God by the dictates of my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, people may say, "Hey, you ought to calm down or to be quiet." You remember they tried to give you There's always going to be a Pharisee around. &gt;&gt; Amen. To try to keep you quiet. Remember, they went in the temple and the babes begin that were given that were uh given suck from THE MOTHER'S BREAST. THEY BEGIN to praise him. Yeah. And the PHARISEES SAID, "HEY, WHAT MEANTH THEE?" THE PRIEST, THEY SAID, "WHAT'S WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?"

HE SAID, "IF THESE SHALL HOLD THEIR PEACE, THE ROCKS WILL CRY OUT. I DON'T WANT NO ROCK TAKING MY PLACE TONIGHT. THAT'S WHY I GOT TO GIVE HIM PRAISE. THAT'S WHY I GOT TO GIVE HIM GLORY. THAT'S WHY I GOT TO GIVE HIM HONOR." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

I thought, man, while I was back there, I said, "Hey, this came to my mind." So, hallelujah. And so, I looked this up and we used to live in Buford, South Carolina. And I thought, well, and they had the Marine Corps Air Station there. I don't know.

Hey, you know, them fighter jets and everything. I just like how they, you know, and all that and my, it just so it just so lovely and all that. Amen. To hear that noise. He said that. Now, listen what he said. The phrase, "The noise you hear is a sound of freedom is a common expression often associated with the loud noise of military aircraft such as fighter jets flying over communities near air bases." The saying serves to remind residents that the sound which might otherwise be considered a nuisance are direct result of military training and operations that protect national security. So you say, "Hey, they're flying over us and it may be a nuisance to a lot of folks." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Hey, just flying over there and hearing all that and them break the uh the sound barrier and all that, hear all that and it may be a nuisance, he said, but to a lot of folks it's for it's the noise of freedom.

And they said, "If anybody asked you, you said the Lord has need of them." &gt;&gt; And when they got to him, they took their coats off, put it on him, put him up up there. And he started going through Jerusalem. And they heard him coming. And they BEGIN TO SING, "HOSANA, BLESSED IS HE THAT comes in the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, I wonder who was following him. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; let's look. I can look get a little picture tonight of maybe some people that were following him. Here comes this little lady up and she was just raising her hands and giving him praise and glory, GIVING HIM HONOR AND EVERYTHING.

Maybe he wasn't loud as that woman was. I don't know. But tears was streaming down his face. Brother Kobe. Oh, he was just crying. They come and said, "What's wrong with you, my good man?" He just said, "I can't help it. I just have to give fit to the way I feel. I can't raise my hands, but I did just I'm just weeping." You see, I was all bound down with devils. &gt;&gt; See what happened to me? I I I I had gone somewhere and drunk a couple drinks and again got home and my wife asked me what was wrong with me and I said, "Well, we had to work overtime." Lied. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Well, how how late did you work?" Then he told another lie. &gt;&gt; Another demon entered him to where there was a legion of them in him. He said, "I was all confused. I was messed up. I didn't KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN AND I'D JUST WANDER OUT IN THE TOMBS AND I'D CUT MYSELF AND I'D BLEED AND ALL THAT STUFF AND I JUST SO MISERABLE. But then there was a storm b coming over. But I was just I just couldn't help myself. But you know what? He left and came across that ocean and brave that storm for the sake of one soul. &gt;&gt; Now don't tell me to hush up. Don't tell me TO STOP WEEPING. I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM. BECAUSE SEE, my family didn't even want to BE AROUND ME. MY KIDS WERE SCARED OF ME. I COULDN'T KEEP A JOB. I COULDN'T DO THIS OR I COULDN'T DO THIS. BUT BECAUSE OF THAT EMANCIPATOR SITTING UP THERE ON THAT DONKEY, I HAVE A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM. DON'T TELL ME TO BE QUIET. AMEN. I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM. If it wasn't FOR HIM, I'M CLOTHED AND IN MY RIGHT MIND. AND IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM, I wouldn't be here. Hallelujah. He's restored me. He's restored my mind.

If it wasn't for that little man riding on that donkey, I wouldn't be here tonight. Oh, no wonder I want to give vent to my feelings. I want to say, "Glory to God. Hosana in the highest. Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hey, let's just Can we take a couple more people? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think about maybe, you know, there's this woman that came up there and she would just oh oh, you know how it is. She was just lifting her hands up. She just worshiping him and everything and oh, she would just oh just sobbing and oh, and every now and then she'd go, "Glory to God." Every now and then she may say, "Hallelujah. Glory to him. Glory to the God in the highest. They might have said, "Who are you?" And she said, "Well, let me tell you my story." Amen. There I was I was I was uh had a blood issue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And my I went to every physician that could be uh thought about. This person said, "Go to here. He's the greatest in the country. He probably can take care of your problem. He's got he's got all the all the modern medicines there is." Where I went to him. He didn't do me no good. I spent in fact I almost spent all depleted all my savings. So he went to this other uh part they went to this other said what about this doctor? What about and she said I went to every physician that could be known to man &gt;&gt; and I depleted all my savings. I depleted all my living. I didn't have nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And yet I wasn't no better. In fact I was worse. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They said but why you pray? said, "You see that little man sitting up there on that donkey?" &gt;&gt; He was in a crowd one day. Oh, God. And I'd heard about him. Hallelujah. He just had left Gyrus's h or on his way to Gyrus's house. His daughter had died going down. And I heard them come to Gyrus, the priest, AND THE THE THEO THEOLOGIANS OF THAT DAY, and they said, "Jyus, don't trouble the master no more. Your daughter is dead." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he told Gyrus, "Don't worry, but only believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just only believe. And I heard that and I thought, my if he could raise a dead person, cuz I believe that's where HE WAS GOING DOWN THERE TO RAISE THAT daughter to his Gyrus's DAUGHTER TO LIFE. AND I figured out if HE COULD GO TO THAT HOUSE THAT HE WAS GOING TO AND RAISE THAT girl from the dead, surely this blood ISSUE OF MINE WOULDN'T BE NOTHING to him. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and I couldn't get to him. The crowd was great. &gt;&gt; BUT SHE KNEW SHE COULD JUST TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT. &gt;&gt; That's all she needed. &gt;&gt; You know how brother Brown describes it that he she he probably didn't even feel her touching. &gt;&gt; The crowd was great. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody was touching him, but in her mind, her heart, it dropped from here to here. That's what it needs to drop. I remember watching a film, brother Kobe of Martin Luther one time. He said, "I got it here." He said, "I got it here." Intellect. He said, "I got it here. I can speak it real good, but wait till it drops from here to here." &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted to do tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. I may have the message all figured out. Amen. And all that intellect, brother, but intellect has never saved anybody. Intellect has never gave anybody the Holy Ghost. Intellect has never set anybody free. Intellect had never gave anybody their freedom. &gt;&gt; And you may speak it. You may know the the message cliches. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We always want to know the message terms. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Feel like the more we know the message terms and the message cliches that we'll get closer to God. But that don't get us CLOSER TO GOD. SOMETIMES THAT JUST give gets us further away. Or if we know this personality OR WE KNOW THIS personality or we know THIS ONE. I REMEMBER ONE TIME JACK CO. YOU REMEMBER HIM? He said, "Hey, he he laid his hand on this woman, Brother Window." She said, "She it he was cold as ice." After he prayed for her, she left. He left and she leaned over to another sister said, "Well, I've been to them all now." He turned around said, rebuked her, SAID, "YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WENT TO WILLIAM BRANDOM. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WENT to AA Allen. You should have went to God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that, hey, I might have not sat in brother Brandham's message meetings or whatever, but I've come to God. I REMEMBER SOMEBODY saying one time and they they ran into somebody in a grocery store and that lady was just a smiling. Oh, she was just so happy. He said he wanted to find out what was her made her so happy and he she finally caught up with her cuz anybody smiling in her grocery store has to be own something or whatever, you know, or whatever. She said, "Ma'am, I noticed you were just so full of joy and so happy." Said, "What's wrong with you?" She said, "I want to tell you AA Allen prayed for me." And that's why she was SO HAPPY BECAUSE AA ALLEN had prayed for her. Well, I tell you one thing. AA ALLEN DIDN'T PRAY for me. I never did get in a prayer line of William Brandham. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING, GOD PRAYED FOR ME. HE TOLD PETER SAID, "I PRAY FOR YOU, PETER." HALLELUJAH. I'M GLAD THAT HE HE SAID, "I PRAY THAT YOU MIGHT BE ONE EVEN AS MY FATHER AND I AM ONE." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; And she said, "If I can only touch with the hem of his garment, I'll be made whole." Hallelujah. All of a sudden, he stopped. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Somebody touch me." &gt;&gt; Peter started rebuking. Said, "Lord, the crowd, it's great. Look at everybody." He said, "Boy, but I feel different. Virtue has flown from me." And he looked around and he seen her. He said, "Woman, thy faith has made thee whole." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she she probably could have told them guys that day, don't get on to me. Don't Don't hush me up. Amen. I don't have to be quiet. I got a right. Cuz if it wasn't for that man, I'd have been dead a long time ago. But because of that man riding up there on the donkey, I got a right to praise him. I GOT A RIGHT TO WORSHIP HIM. I GOT A RIGHT TO SHOUT. I GOT A RIGHT TO DANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember that woman at the well when Jesus sent his disciples to buy some biddles? You remember? and and and sent him on away and and brother prophet God said he had to do it that way because you know how was because hey there was this they probably say hey why you going by because you know how they were just human beings like we were they was probably you know how it is segregation that woman brought up that deal segregation all that probably would have got on to the Lord why you going buy them dogs &gt;&gt; why you going to buy them that place for that's nothing but a bunch of you know pigs or whatever they call them or whatever said that that we we don't have no dealings to do with them but Jesus said is said, "I have a need to go by the way of Samaria. I wonder if he's got a need to come by here tonight in Pony, Oklahoma, New Life Outreach." Uh, maybe somebody needs them tonight. Maybe somebody needs a Holy Ghost. Maybe somebody needs a refilling tonight. Maybe somebody needs uh uh uh uh to be energized tonight. And you're going to only be energized by the power of Almighty God. And he says, "I got a need to go by the New Life Outreach." Amen. To to to Ponyie, Oklahoma. There's somebody that's got a need. And then you can go out this door and people can say, "What's the matter with you? DON'T HUSH ME UP. I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM BECAUSE I HAD A NEED AND HE CAME MY WAY. HE CAME BY MY WAY AND I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I got a right to praise him. &gt;&gt; I got a right to give him glory. &gt;&gt; I got a right to give him honor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can see him going by that way because he had a need to go by that way there. That woman came out. She couldn't come out with the rest of the women because she had a bad name. You know, he was sitting on the whale. There's a whale sitting on top of a whale. I like that. &gt;&gt; She found her seventh and last husband. Completion. Hey, goes, "Hey," he said, "You had five and the one you're living with is not yours. He's sitting there and she came out. Y'all know the scripture. They begin to talk and said, you know, said, and he said, if you knew who I was and the gift, if you knew who you were speaking to and the gift to God, you'd have came asking me for a drink. Oh, sometimes I think it's like they said here about the natural and everything. I think sometimes we forget about it and we go to thinking about the natural and all that. She was just thinking about the natural because she said, "Hey, this well's deep. are you are you better than our fathers Jacob who dug this well and all that said hey he said she was just thinking about the natural but if we really thought about who he was and the gift of God you to come in here tonight and say God I need A DRINK TONIGHT I NEED A DRINK I'M THIRSTY LORD MY SOUL I've been I've BEEN SUCH A DRY SPELL AND I'M THIRSTY TONIGHT AND I NEED A DRINK FROM THE FOUNTAIN THAT NEVER RUNS dry &gt;&gt; and he'll fill that cup &gt;&gt; just lift your cup and he'll fill that cup. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, Brother David, my cup's got a bottom in it." Pray God give you a bottom in your cup, then pray that after he gives you a bottom in your cup, pray that he'll fill it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll fill it up tonight, won't he? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll fill it up. He'll put a bottom in that cup for you. He'll fill it up. He'll fill it to overflowing and it flow out on somebody else. &gt;&gt; I want Hey, I don't want only me to get it, but I want it to flow out on somebody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want to I don't want to come in here every night or in have my umbrella. I want to take my umbrella down. Amen. I like I said, I might have said it here. Somebody said, "Did you bring your thimble tonight?" No, I didn't bring my thimble. Did you bring your uh h a a cup tonight? No, I didn't bring my cup. I brought my tanker truck AND I BACKED IT UP TO THE BACK DOOR AND I'M SAYING, "FILL IT UP, LORD." AMEN. FILL IT UP, LORD. HALLELUJAH. I imagine how they got to talking. She said, 'Well, you know they say, "Hey, you say we're supposed to worship uh at the mountain, but uh we say Jerusalem." He said, "Hey, there's coming a time where you knew the words this mountain or Jerusalem, but the father seeketh s who worships him in spirit in truth." He told said, "Go get your husband. Come here." He said," he said, "Sir, I have no husband." HE SAID, "YOU'VE HAD FIVE, AND THE ONE YOU'RE LIVING WITH IS NOT YOURS." She said, "Sir, I perceived your prophet." He said, "We know that when the Messiah comes, he'll say all the us these things." He said, "Who are you, though?" He said, "I'm he that SPEAKS TO YOU." SHE LEFT HER one place. Brother Bram said she left her DENOMINATIONAL POT RIGHT THERE. RAN INTO THE CITY and said, "Come see A MAN WHO TOLD ME EVERYTHING I DID." He didn't tell her everything. HE JUST TOLD HER ONE THING. &gt;&gt; But I bet she realized that if he knew that one thing, he knows everything. &gt;&gt; And so they ran into her that day, said, "Hey, don't tell me to hush up. &gt;&gt; I got a right to praise him. I got a right to give him joy. &gt;&gt; I got a right to raise my hands. I got a right to dance if I want to. AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR SAT THERE ON THAT DONKEY. AMEN. AT ONE TIME I WAS TROUBLED. I COULDN'T GO IN OR OUT. NOBODY WANTED ME. NOBODY WANTED TO GIVE ME THE TIME OF DAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But that man sitting up there on the donkey came my way and told me that I could go free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I took the well back home with me that day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, don't you want to take the well back home with you? &gt;&gt; I want to take the well back home with me. Every day, every hour of the day, I want to take the whale back home with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what's that? I hear I hear the sound of freedom in here tonight. Amen. Are you free tonight? Can you worship God tonight? Cuz you know as well as I do that if it wasn't for the grace of God, you wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; Caleb, if I told you right there, son, if I told you, come here. I got $500 in my pocket. If you'll just come up here and get it, and he came up here and get it, then he'd go around the next day said, "David, brother David, can I come mow your grass?" Why? Well, you gave me $500. That was a gift. I just gave it to you. You didn't have to do nothing for it. THAT WAS THE GRACE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WE didn't have to do nothing for it. WE DIDN'T EARN IT. WE DIDN'T MARRY IT. HE JUST GAVE IT TO US. &gt;&gt; How many's been pulled over by a cop? &gt;&gt; And you know the first thing they asked you, son or ma'am, do you know why I pulled you over? You said, "Well, come on. Don't lie now. You know why he pulled you over." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Boy, I ALREADY THROW THE BOOK AT YOU." But if you said, "You know what? Just go on and don't speed no more. Be careful. What is that? Mercy. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you deserve to get a ticket &gt;&gt; cuz you was doing wrong. But he gave you mercy. &gt;&gt; The judge said, "You're guilty. Do you have anything to say?" I turned and I spoke up. Said, "Your honor, I have no defense." That's when mercy walked in and PLEADED MY CASE. HALLELUJAH. THE BLOOD WAS PRESENTED. HALLELUJAH. I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM. THANK GOD FOR GRACE. I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING FOR IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And thank God for mercy cuz I deserve to go to hell. BUT HE PAID THE PRICE THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO.

I mean, we've been going through it. Seemed like the last year, year and a half. But hey, God's been so gracious. He's always been good. He's always provided. &gt;&gt; When we seemed like we didn't know maybe where the next daughter or something was coming, he's always provided. He's always made a way. I remember, hey, I got a right to praise him. I got a right to worship him. I remember the first time I ever ran down the aisle. There's a brother that came and preached for us. I ain't going to call his name. Some of you may know him. If I call him, he's gone on now. And he was a P. Wow. &gt;&gt; It's in a prison camp. He knew what it was to be free. He he he one time they told him they'll go pick up this log and carry it down a little ways by himself. Said they treated him awful in that prison camp. Said he was there by himself, brother. He said he did not know how he was going to take that log back down there by himself. and he got it up and he just and then all of a sudden he heard felt it just like that. He knew somebody was behind him helping him. They walked down there and laid it down there where it's supposed to be. He turned around and there was nobody there. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He said, "I know who it was." &gt;&gt; I remember one time he would just he preached a message, you know, worshiping God. What is that scripture? Living in unrighteousness but trying to r worship a righteous God. And he went down that aisle. He just going like this down that aisle. And all of a sudden I said to myself, I said, "Man, I wish I was out there with him." And brother Window, I don't know what happened, &gt;&gt; but all of a sudden something happened to me, Sister Martin. Amen. Something hit me. And I ran down that aisle just as fast as I could. Man, JUST DANCING AROUND. JUMPED in Brother Clark's arms. I didn't know what hit me. All I said was, "I wish I was." He knew what it was to be free. &gt;&gt; Remember, you remember Brother Brown talking about that eagle that is in that Cincinnati zoo that was caged in, &gt;&gt; beating his head against the the cage and falling back and looking up to that's where he was born. He was born to sell the blue. He said, "But I'll show you another pitiful sight. It's what a child of God, a son or a daughter of God that was born to serve God, but the devil's got them all bound down or her bound down in a cage of sin. He said that's a pitiful sight. But once God comes by, Amen. and set you free. The great emancipator came by one day and set us free. Hallelujah. Amen. And we got a right to praise him. We got a right to worship him. Amen. And some of us may, you may not be a little emotional as some others, but I tell you what, SOMETHING GOES ALL OVER ME WHEN I THINK OF WHAT GOD, AMEN. HOW THAT HE CALLED MY NAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It was LAYING UNDER THEM SEALS. PERHAPS I DIDN'T. HE DIDN'T SAY David Gadman or Wendle Martin, but something on the inside for the window spoke to us. &gt;&gt; Pulled back them pages. We found out our name was right there. &gt;&gt; No wonder John shouted. Everything in earth heard him. Everything was under the earth. Everything in heaven and under the heaven heard John cry out. Amen. We've been set free. Hallelujah. One of these days, oh brother, your husband, he won't have to be in a hospital room. He won't have to be on a walker, wheelchair, whatever. Hallelujah. One of these days, Brother Windle, we'd be sitting around that table thousands of miles long. Oh, I don't know. Maybe we'll be sitting across from one another, tears be run down, and we can say, "Brother Wendle," you say, "Brother Dave, we made it. We made it. WE MADE IT." HALLELUJAH.
