to Revelations chapter 2 Revelations chapter 2 and we're going to read verses 18 18- 29 and unto the angel of the church in thyra write these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first not with understanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornications and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her the space to repent of her fornication and she repented not but behold I will cast her into a bed and then that them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which search the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say and unto the rest in thy atyra as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star he that hath an ear let him ear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's go ahead and bow our heads Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord we thank you for allowing us this opportunity just to to gather together once more this evening Lord to to worship you and to be in your presence Lord Lord as always we're we're a needy people Lord Lord I got a a text for it came up here from Brother Wendell just reminding us that uh brother uh Jimmy is supposed to be having cataract surgery tomorrow Lord Lord we pray that you would just be with him as he would go in to have those cataracts removed Lord Lord we pray that you would just guide the doctors Lord that that Lord Lord you would just allow him to be able to to see well once more Lord Jesus that you would restore that Vision to him Lord and Lord that you would allow him to be able to to get out and around a little bit easier Lord Jesus Lord we continue to remember the the Saints in Florida Lord as the the Hurricanes coming through Lord Lord even now getting ready to make landfall and Lord we pray that you would just continue to be the the protection for their Saints Lord Jesus Lord we know that that you're able to calm the storms Lord that you're able to be the barrier Lord to

Lord as we would continue on in the church age book lord I pray that you would just Lord give me the the right words to speak Lord may I just be able to bring it out in just a a way that would be easy

you would take complete control Lord we just love you and we praise you Lord and we just commit the reign of the service into your hands in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may all have your seats sister keys if you'll go ahead and put up that first picture so I am one that uh I always like to see you know when we're talking about these uh different different uh cities that are in Asia Minor this is to kind of maybe let everybody get a little bit of a picture of what we're we're talking about um and so here you have the the seven churches that are receiving the letters um you know and if you look um down below where uh Ephesus is listed below the actual word Ephesus if you go down you find the aisle of patmas which is where John was when he was receiving this Revelation and writing this uh writing out this this revelation of Jesus Christ and uh so you have the seven churches that are they are spread across Asia Minor um and obviously we've already talked about uh and gone through several chapters here and so we're going to be beginning with the the theran church age tonight um and so if we want to go ahead and turn to uh page 213 uh in our church age book and we've already read the verses from Revelation so we're going to start down at the bottom thyre now historically the city of thyre was the least noteworthy of all the Seven Cities of the Revelation it was situated on the confines of Mia and Ionia it was surrounded by many rivers but they were full of leeches its most commendable feature was that it was well off financially due to the corporate Guilds of The Potters Tanners Weavers Dyers Rob makers Etc it was from this city that Lydia the seller of purple came she was Paul's first European convert now the reason that Spirit chose this city as the one already containing the spiritual elements for the fourth age was because of its religion the major religion of thyro was the worship of Apollo tyrenos which was joined with the emperor worship cult Apollo was the son God and next in power to his father father Zeus he was known as the averter of evil he presided over religious law and ex experation the means of atonement making amends for wrongdoing or guilt Plato said of him he explains to men the institution of temples sacrifices and services to deities besides rights connected with death and afterlife he communicated his knowledge of the future and his father's will to men through the prophets and Oracle in thyra this ritual was conducted by a propheus who sat on a tripod chair and delivered the messages while entranced we're going to try to move this so that we're not blowing things up quite so much let see if this will work a little bit better over here all right the hold of this religion was remarkable its formidable power did not lie exclusively in the realm of mystery but lay in the fact that no no one could belong to the guilds which offered the people their living unless they belong to the temple worship of Apollo anyone who refused to join in the idolatrous feasts and lucidious orgis were barred from those first century unions in order to be a part of the social and Commercial life one had to be a practicing Pagan idolator it is most most worthy of note that the very name thyra means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly invades all conquers all and despotically controls now dominating female is the greatest curse in the world the wisest man the world ever saw was Solomon and he said I applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and Madness and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and Nets and her hands is bands who so pleaseth God shall escape from her but the Sinners shall be taken by her behold this I have found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but I find not one man amongst a thousand have I found but a woman amongst all those have I not found Ecclesiastes 7: 25-28 Paul said I suffer not a woman to teach or to usurp Authority from the Garden of Eden onward woman has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man and right today it is the Woman's World with the goddess of America being a naked female as the female Idol falling out of the Skies remember her arms were iron bars characterized the first or Ephesian age so her power has grown until she gained absolute Authority such Authority being usurped by her iron disposition now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the Holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the male for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does see is intruding into that male domain taking Authority and perverting herself and when a woman invades the pulpit which is commanded she must not do she shows what Spirit she is of being a dominating female is Antichrist and the seeds of the Roman Catholic Church are in her though she may Des deny this ever so V vehemently but when it comes to the word let God be true and every man's word a lie amen let us go back to the beginning in the original physical creation we know it today God made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens R rooster and hen there were two cattle the cow and the bull and right down the line but when it came to man there was only one there were not a pair Adam had been made in the image of God he was the son of God as a Son of God he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so God took a byproduct of man to cause the fall man never stepped fresh from woman never stepped fresh from the hand of God as a true product of God she was produced from man and when God caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female in cre creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed Satan to seduce her by the way of The Serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before God in his word she is the type of all things vulgar foul and loathsome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy is the receptable of the spirit and blessing of God on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other she is called the bride of Christ on one hand she is called mystery baby the Abomination before God and on the other hand she is called New Jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she summarily cast into the Lake of Fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she ex exalted to Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as the only place befitting such a queen now I want to go back um you know we're going to kind of tie into some things that we've read already in here a while back so let's go back to page 69 back in the Ephesian Church age you know brother Wendell has been bringing out and pointing out throughout this how you have the two Vines you have the two trees you have the two churches that are continually growing up together and then you see the same type as he's going into this with uh the women that you've got the two types you have and he's bringing this out and in the tharian age pointing out you can have the most holy the most beautiful and you can have the most wicked the most lewd the most despicable both at the same time going on so as we go back to page 69 uh we're going to start about halfway down the page now let us be very careful that we are not confused at this point thus we will seek the word to validate this claim let us go back to the book of the beginnings Genesis in the Garden of Eden there were two trees one was good one was evil one produced life the other produced death there were two children who originally offered sacrifices to God let me repeat that they both offered sacrifices to God and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect but one one Cain was evil being of his father that Wicked one while Abel was righteous before the Lord again there were two children from the Flesh of the same parents they were the twins of Isaac and Rebecca excuse me one was the elect of God and the other was reprobate both worshiped God in every single case there was worship of God involved in every case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the right but notice they were planted together they lived together they both made claims upon God and worshiped God these illustrations depict perfectly the parable of the Lord Jesus Christ when he said the kingdom of heaven was like unto a man who sowed good seed only to have an enemy come and plant tears amongst those good seeds God did not plant the tears Satan planted those tears right amongst the good seed of God those two kinds of plants people from two different seeds grew up together they partook of the nourishment in the same Earth they shared in the same Sun rain and all the other benefits and both were harvested in their turn do you see it don't ever forget these truths as we study the church ages and later the seals and above all don't forget that is in this last age when the tears are getting Bound for their burning that they will shove out the wheat that is to be garnered by the Lord I want to carry this thought all the way through so let us go a step further have you ever studied the history of revivals now a Revival signifies a move of God in power and every time God moves Satan is there to move also it never fails in the days of the great Welsh Revival and most people don't know this the insane asylums filled up quickly and it was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God it is written that in Wesley's days that people would do most peculiar things that were definitely of Satan to try to mock the goodness and power of God in Luther's day it is said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested the Roman Catholic church but the miracle lay in the fact that he could and did stay sound and sane amidst the Fanatics who are often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and if you've been aware of this last day Ministry you will have noted the same invasion of false and wicked Spirits it has to be that way now I hope and trust you are spiritual mind enough to get that and capitalize it just to seal this point on the true and false Vines mingling and demonstrating the two spirits that are at work let us look in 1 John 4: 1-4 and Jude 3412 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world year of God little children and have overcome them the Antichrist spirit because greater is he God's spirit that is in you than he that is in the world Jude 34:12 behold when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints but there are certain men not Saints crept in unawares these have not come into the fold by means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ these are spots in your feasts of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear it cannot to be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seed let's move forward to page 85 still in the Ephesian Church age and about 2third of the way down the page on page 85 did you get it now those are those twins again there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same Earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain and benefiting by the same Sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God exactly as God gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of God and changes it where it all it wants to it substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan and so here you have this setting between the two different women the two different churches you have the evil and you have the good couple more quotes that I want to read these are out of marriage and divorce now what a difference in this day in this day of conception instead of him being her ruler she became his God sure she rules him now you can probably well understand what I've been hitting at by her beauty and her sex control her shape that was given to her by Satan the byproduct that Satan did she is sent to deceive the sons of God and she can sway more of them to Hell than any other instrument Satan has got that's exactly right I'm talking of the immoral now not you sisters we'll give you your place right place in a few minutes in the word of God it was in God's plan from the beginning now to do this today what is the god of the United States you remember remember in the Tabernacle years ago I preached on that the God of this modern day a little flapper sitting there with makeup on and dress pulled up over knees and things like that I said behold your God and that's right she is on every advertisement half naked she is on the street the same way it's an instrument of Satan from the beginning Jesus said we see that it is so now and from the beginning and what he's talking about now the heathens used to make her a god did you know that a goddess sure did they made her a goddess for they did have sex acts in their worship they claimed that she was the creator in her womb she carried the seed and created that's a lie there's only one Creator that's God do you remember Paul there Diana of Ephesus an image of grock said the goddess of Heaven throwed down don't you see how Heathen worship is and we not knowing it turn right straight back to Heathen worship again to women the very lowest creature on the earth woman worship she will sway man any way she wants to and not knowing all that beauty on the outside that is on the inside Solomon said her Gates is the gates to hell now we see plainly there what Jesus spoke of in Revelation the 2 chapter and the 15 verse of the nickan doctrine the oncoming of that church pulling itself away from the word and also we see here plainly these vulgar ungodly filthy programs that we have on television of Hollywood sex Queens we can see the filth of this city as these kids little old girls walking up and down the street here with little bitty tight clothes twisting around it's cold enough to freeze them to death they don't know that's the devil doing that they are possessed of an evil spirit and don't know it and then dropping down he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him Same by himself his children began to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing or they become children of the word not children of the church Children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made the theory she'll be purely unadulterated Bride of the word amen and amen I hope that you get that on the air she will be the pregnated daughter of God see what a great honor a woman can be see what a great thing the church can be but you see where filth has got her to then trying to compare that church out there with the church here you can't do it and try to compare the street Harlot with the Church of the Living God or the woman the correct woman with a harlot why is there such a thing as that it's the law of God the law of contrast how how will we know how to enjoy daylight if there wasn't a night how will we know how to enjoy the dry weather if there wasn't rain how would we know to enjoy and respect a real woman if there wasn't a dirty one and then dropping down just to finish this thought out and uh in marriage and divorce brother brandom continues says notice now the woman has got her place and she is a jewel Solomon this man that had 10,000 wives or had a thousand wives rather he said a man that's found a wife has found found a good thing a good woman is a jewel in his crown that's an honor but an unrighteous one is water in his blood that's his life he said there might be one righteous man found in a thousand Solomon said said you wouldn't find one righteous woman in a thousand Solomon said that you see now notice that how it is but you see woman you are a jewel if you want to be a jewel but the desire has to be by you and so like brother Brandon was laying out you have on the one hand the woman can be so foul and wicked and lewd that she would be summarily cast into the Lake of Fire as the only fit place for her but on the other hand we have our sisters we have the bride standing forth that is exalted to Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as the only Place befitting such a queen as brother brandham it's the law said it's the law of contrast you have the light versus the dark and here we're seeing the True Vine and the false Vine the true church and the false Church the true godly woman and that Jezebel going back to page 216 halfway down the page was where we left off and just continuing in and in this thotran church age she is a dominating female she is Mystery babyon she is the great she is Jezebel the false propheus why because the true female is submissive to God Christ is her head she has no word but his no thoughts but his no leadership but his but what about this church she has cast out the word destroyed the Bibles and worthy essays of The Godly she has slain those who had preach the truth she has taken over Kings princes and Nations controls armies and insists that she is the True Body of Christ and that her Popes are the Vicor of Christ she is entirely seduced by the devil until she is in turn become the Seducer of others she is the Bride of Satan has produced his bastard child religions all through the Dark Ages she has dominated for over 900 years she plundered and destroyed she killed the Arts destroyed the Sciences produced nothing but death until the light of truth was almost entirely gone and only the beest sliver of light remained the oil in the wide had almost ceased to flow but though she dominated the world kingdoms and demanded that all men find their citizenship in her there was a little group who belonged to God and their citizenship was in heaven and then them she could not destroy God kept his little flock they would not be destroyed this Church of Rome was as Heathen and wicked as Queen aalia who tried to destroy all the Royal seed and almost succeeded but God preserved one and of him there came more of the faithful so God preserved a little flock in that long dark night and of their truth there finally arose a Luther anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Catholic church and its form of worship can tell why this city of thoyre was chosen by the spirit to represent the church in the Dark Age there it is right before our eyes the thot tyan age lasted the longest of them all about 900 years from 606 to 1520 so thyra brother random said was the city that in a lot of ways was least of all the cities that are listed out as the church ages but yet one thing it had was that it had much wealth because it had the it was able to produce the the the purple goods and had all kinds of guilds and things but yet they took all of this production all of this being involved in uh in in in work and being able to actually make money and provide and they tied all that back into the religion of the day you were only able to be a part of the guild if you were a practicing member of the church if you were willing to go and participate in the feast if you were willing to go and worship Apollo and do these different things otherwise you couldn't be part of it you would be left out you wouldn't be able to participate you wouldn't be able to provide for your family you wouldn't be able to earn a living you wouldn't be able to do any of these things because you were not worshiping them you were not worshiping Apollo you were not part of that church and so you were fully cut out you know you see when they talk about that you'll need a mark to be able to set when we look at the prophecies later on in Revelation you can see the same thing actually being practiced in this time that you had to have the mark you had to be part of the church you had to be part of this apostate Church worshiping the way they wanted you to worship willing to give up all truth if you wanted to be able to provide if you wanted to be part of society if you wanted to be part of everything going around this was the darkest age and as you look at this city you can see it where there would be almost no light how would you provide for your family if you wanted to if you were a believer in this town obviously we know that God can provide but this wasn't going to be an easy path this wasn't going to be a way that you could I can go out and I can know I can make plenty of money and provide for my family no it would be a I'm scraping every single day to try to get enough to feed myself to feed my family to do whatever because I'm not a part of it I'm not doing everything they want and so because that I'm not part of the guilds I'm not part of any of the organizations I'm cut off I'm separate and then that began to manifest through the age as the Catholic Church took on more and more power through the age itself to where if you weren't part of the Catholic Church you weren't able to do that much you were cut off you would be hunted down you would be held up and put Through Torture and all these different things to try to get you to convert to what they said was the only way and the only truth continuing into the messenger now the church had long been split into two groups Western and Eastern every now and then a reformer would arise and either or both divisions and for a while lead some segment of the church into a deeper relationship with God such a man in the west was Francis of aisi truly successful time his work was finally put under by the hierarchy of Rome now Francis of aisi started the what are now known as The Franciscan monks they would basically lay aside claim all claim to any type of worldly wealth all they cared about was preaching the gospel they went the opposite when you looked at the Catholic Church as a whole they were all about getting more money get more money get more money and Francis of aisu came in and he said no that doesn't matter we'll lay aside everything we will live the bare minimum that we can okay and for a time as brother brandham said they were able to do some good works they were able to begin to to sway in some way but eventually even that was swallowed back up by the Catholic church now Peter Waldo of lions a merchant who renounced his secular life became very active in serving the lord and Drew many unto him but he was thwarted in his work and excommunicated by the pope neither the western or the Eastern group had within them a man who could possibly be the messenger to this age when examined in the light of scriptures however there were two men in the British Isles whose Ministry and word and deed could stand the test of Truth they were St Patrick and St Columba it was to St Columba that the lot of being the messenger fell now though the messenger to the thot tyan age was St Columba I want to dwell a little on the life of St Patrick as an example to us and also to give the LIE to Rome's claim that St Patrick was any more one of her than was Joan of Arc sister keys if you'll put up picture to and you can just leave that up while we're talking about St Patrick now Patrick was born to the sister of St Martin in the little town of bonver on the banks of the river Clyde one day while playing on the shoreline with his two sisters Pirates approached and kidnapped all three where the sisters went no one knows but Patrick whose name was suck at was sold to a chieftain in Northern irand his duty was to tend the swine to do this he trained dogs so well trained were his dogs that many people came from far and near to buy them in his loneliness he turned to God and was saved then came the Urgent desire to escape and return home to his parents he formed a plan that put his ability as a trainer to Great use he taught the dogs to lie on him and cover his body carefully and not move until commanded thus one day when his owner sold several dogs Patrick commanded the dogs except the leader of the pack to get into the boat the leader of pack to which he then gave a secret signal ran off and refused to come aboard while the master and the buyer attempted to get the dog Patrick got onto the into the boat and Signal the dogs to cover him then with a whistle he brought the leader of the pack into the boat and on top of him since Patrick was nowhere to be seen the buyer put up sail and moved out to sea after making sure that the captain was too far out to turn back Patrick gave another signal to the dogs which caused them to Riot then he came forth and told the captain that unless he would put him ashore at his home he would command the dogs to keep riding and he would take over the ship however the captain was a Christian and when he heard the boy's story he gladly put him ashore at his home there Patrick went to Bible school and returned to Ireland where by the word and the power of God and many signs and wonders he won thousands to the Lord in no time did he ever go to Rome nor at any time was he commissioned by Rome the truth of the matter is that when Rome finally gained foothold on the island and when they saw the time was opportune they killed over a 100,000 Christians who had over the years grown out of the original group that had come to the Lord under St Patrick now this painting that's here is called the legend of St Patrick and you can go through and find all kinds of Miracles that happened during St Patrick's Ministry but this painting references one that you can either take it as it just being a legend or whether it actually happened but after Patrick had come and this was during the time when there was not a singular King that was over all of Ireland it was different uh smaller kings that ruled over their their tribes or they were The Chieftains of certain areas and so he was there working to convert the people working to convert this King and there were many Druids that were in that area and this one king had his Druids that served him and after quite some time of just observing Patrick and seeing how he acted the King was finally invited him to come and speak to him now The Druids were so upset and so ticked off because they were concerned that if Patrick actually got through to the king that he would be converted and so once they knew that Patrick was supposed to be coming to speak to the king they went and they sent set an ambush for him they gathered the soldiers and warriors that they could and they waited along the path that led to uh the stade or Castle or whatever you would call it so that way they could kill Patrick and and his fellow brothers in Christ that were with him now they were there waiting and before Patrick and the rest of his group had left they had prayed for protection that the Lord would watch over them and they went walking along to reach the the king to be able to speak to him and here's this Ambush and wait and as they come through the Ambush never sees them but what they see is they see a herd of deer walk across the clearing they never see a man they never see a person all they see are this herd of deer walk by and Patrick and his group successfully go by and reach the king and they're able to minister to him and they're able to actually convert him to Christ now like I said whether this is just purely a legend or whether this is Poss possibly just a miracle of God I'll let you decide that on your own but we know that God can blind the eyes and we know that God can open the eyes and so I don't see any reason why God couldn't do something like that but either way Patrick was a mighty man of God that did his best to lead the people to Christ now if you'll go on to the next picture sister Keys continuing at the bottom of page 218 about 60 years after the death of St Patrick Columba was born in County donle North Island to the royal family of Fergus I'm going to pause here just for a moment so Patrick came back to lead Ireland to Christ to witness to them and then Columba is born to the royal family of Ireland after Patrick has come and testified and led them away from the Druid worship to Christianity so though we know that Patrick wasn't the messenger to the age at the same time you can probably say he had an impact on that messenger coming because he brought the message he was the one sent to bring the message to Ireland that's right and then out of that you have the messenger come forward he became a brilliant consecrated scholar committing to memory most of the scripture God called him in an audible voice to be a missionary after he had heard the voice of God nothing could stop him and his miraculous Ministry has caused many historians to Acclaim him next to the apostles so great was his Ministry with the supernatural signs following that some especially students in Rome have thought the accounts were exaggerated in one of his missionary Journeys he approached a walled City he found the gates barred against him he lifted his voice in prayer that God might intervene and allow him access to the people in order to preach but as he prayed the court magicians began to harass him with loud noises he then began to sing a Psalm as he sang God so in greas the the volume of his voices that he drowned out the cries of the Heathen suddenly the gates burst open of their own accord he entered in and preached the gospel winning many to the Lord on another occasion when he was also shut out from a village as he turned to waited apart the sun of the chief suddenly became violently ill even unto death St Columbo was quickly sought after and recalled when he prayed the prayer of faith the boy was instantly healed The Village was then open to evangelization by the gospel the pure gospel that was preached by Columba and his fellow workers spread over the whole of Scotland turning it to God it also overflowed into Ireland and over northern Europe his means of spreading the gospel was one wherein perhaps 12 men under a leader would go into a new area and literally literally build a gospel centered Town amongst these 12 men would be Carpenters teachers preachers Etc all wonderfully versed in the word and holy living this little colony was enclosed by wall soon this enclosure would be surrounded by students and their families in their own homes learning the word and preparing to go out and serve the Lord as missionaries leaders and preachers the men were free to marry though many did not in order to serve God better they remained free from State help and thereby steered clear of politics instead of ever attacking other religions they taught the truth for they believed that the truth was weapon enough to accomplish the ends that God had in mind for them they were absolutely independent of Rome St Columbo was the founder of a great Bible school on the island of high off the Southwest coast of Scotland when he went there the islands was so Barren and Rocky that could not bear enough food for them all but Columba planted seed with one hand while he held the other a loft in prayer today the island is one of the most fertile in the world from this Bible centered Island went forth Mighty Scholars endowed with wisdom and the power of God when I read the history of this great servant of God and the wonderful work he did it saddened my heart to find the papal power lusting to bring all men into its grasp came and eventually defiled those Mission fields and destroyed the truth as it was taught by Columba as brother bam has laid out in other chapters we're going through here Columbus stayed out of politics he stayed out of anything that would be formalized and he just taught the truth he just taught the word and left it at that he didn't need to attack The Druids or attack any other religion all he did was teach the truth because that was weapon enough that's right I don't need to go out and point out their mistakes if I'm just teaching the truth I don't need to go out and point out where they're wrong or what they've done as long as I keep preaching the truth and keep bringing that out that's all that we need and the rest is up to the Lord to take care of you can go ahead and take that down toes now as we go into the salutation Revelations 2 and verse 18 these things saith the Son of God who have his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass the revelation of godhead to the thyon age is that Jesus is the son of God once in the days of his flesh he was known known as the son of man but henceforth we know him no more after the flesh he is no longer the son of man the great prophet who in himself gathered together all prophecies the only begotten is back to the bosom of the father now we know him after the power of the Resurrection he is risen and has taken unto himself his mighty power and is above all and overall to the praise of his own Glory his glory will he not share with another his leadership over the church he will not surrender to any man he looks down upon thyra and here he sees in that City in that fourth age the honor of which belongs to him alone bestowed upon another his eyes Blaze with the fire of Wrath and judgment as he sees Apollo revered as the Son of God when he alone is the only begotten of the father how awful must his judgment be upon the religion of the thyon age wherein the church members like Pagan worshippers of the Son of God Apollo the son of Zeus elevate a human ruler to adoration backed by the power of the state for that is exactly what he saw the Roman Catholic Church fully immersed in idol worship based upon the rights of the sun god Apollo had elevated a man to actual deity the pope through the marriage of the church to the state for Thomas aquinus and alvaris Pelagius formulated and stated that the pope seems to those who view him with the spiritual eye to be not a man but a god there are no bounds to his authority he can declare to be right what he will and can take away from any their rights as he sees it sees fit to doubt this Universal Power leads to being shut out from salvation the great enemies of the church are the Heretics who will not wear the Yoke of true obedience when you go in and you begin to look at uh what the Catholic Church did that's the stance that they took you know at this time you had a lot of even back then you had a lot of different versions of Christianity that were around that were you know maybe they hadn't gone full denomination yet but they had these are our Creeds or these are our practices or this is ours and this is that and the Catholic Church took the stand that we are the only option anyone else is a complete heretic anyone else they should be be tortured they should be cast out they should be set aside as utter heathens even if they say they still worship the same Jesus Christ even if they say they do this throw them out you have to be under the offices of the Catholic Church you have to be accepting the pope you have to be going our way just like we saw in the thot tyan that you had to be worshiping the same way in order to be part of society in order to be able to work and able to be able to do any of these things and the Catholic Church took that same stand you have to be part of us you have to fall under our control now there is one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus the son of God 1 Timothy 2: 5 but the pope of Rome has changed the word he made it one mediator between God and man not men so now he mediates between the mediator and men but there is no other mediator save the son the pope pronounces salvation through the Church of Rome but there is no salvation except through the Son of God no wonder the eyes blaze in fiery judgment no wonder the feet are like fine brass as he stands ready to trample into powder and dust the wicked kingdoms of this world thank God for those strong feet of brass they have passed through the Judgment for us they are now our foundation for what he gained is ours we stand identified in him Jesus the son of God it was in this age that we witnessed the rise of en forced idol worship to such an extent that it meant death to those who refused the icons of place within the church under Empress Theodora alone from 842 to 867 over a 100,000 saints were killed because they reputed the images of no value surely this age must repent or lose all there stands the Lord of glory god very God his word cast aside his person rejected but human hands and human hearts cannot depose him let them deny him he remaineth faithful fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and when I come with feet of brass and flaming eyes I will recompense judgment is mine I will repay sayeth the Lord the eulogy I Know Thy works and love and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first here again we find the same introductory remarks I Know Thy works the Son of God himself was said believe me for the very Works sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry his holy spirit in the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in them Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a Sav life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good works even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of God is for men to do evil works and then say they are doing the will of the Lord that is what the Bishops and popes and the hierarchy of Rome were doing they were killing maming and doing all manner of evil in the name of the Lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that evil day those True Believers Shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned cursing with blessing and did the truth to honor God even though many died for it in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their Works testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir if you are a CH Christian then you're going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life I know your love service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I am nothing whatever I do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right there that these Believers weren't in the nickan class that did works as a means of Salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost that love in their hearts was God's love for his own Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have love one for another the pagans who saw the lives of the early Christians said behold how they love each other John said everyone that loveth is born of God first John 4:7 I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in lead toer the last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they have haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us I think that explains pretty qu clearly why brother Wendell will spend so much time preaching about love and preaching about how we're supposed to love those around us and love our brothers and sisters and love the people in the world around us not love the world but love the people in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and love of the Brethren God commended them for it I know your service Jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all a wise man commented on that saying here's what he said only history will prove the truth of that dictum that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they have not used their wealth right but look into history and you will find that the truly great were those who served others history can never Acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he said you don't know now what I am doing but you will know Hereafter but what you see me doing you also ought to do he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights and one day in the Judgment of the Saints we are going to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant enter thou into to the joy of the Lord it is hard to be always a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master from the Dawn Till Setting Sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care and when all of life is over and our work on Earth is done and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there I know your faith now he does not here he does not St here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now but he is commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1:3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has come by the trial of our faith Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outworking of our patience as seen in James 1:4 but let patience have her perfect work that you may perfect be perfect in entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these Saints of the dark Asians patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they served God that as all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased increased how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first now as we've already said this age is called the Dark Ages because it was indeed the darkest period of all history it was the age of Pope Innocent III who claimed that he was the Vicor of Christ Su Supreme Sovereign over the church in the world who instituted the Inquisition which under his Direction shed more blood than at any other time except in Reformation it was the age of pornocracy the rule of harlots Sagittarius II had M mistress and filled the paple choir with paramor and bastard sons and turned the paple palace into a den of robbers anastasius III was smothered to death by marosia who was mistress to sarius John the 11th was Mosa's illegitimate son John the 12th was the grandson of marosia and he violated widows and virgins and was killed in the act of adultery by the woman's enraged husband it was the age of Papa Schism for two lines of popes one ruling from Aenon and the other from Rome cursed and fought each other these popes were not only guilty of immoral sex acts fing scores of illegitimate children committing sodomy Etc but were guilty of selling Priestly offices to the highest bitters it was the age when the light glowed ever so faintly yet the few Believers labored more fervently as the darkness increased until toward the end of the age many arose attempting reforms their labor were so fervent that they paved the way for the oncoming Reformation therefore as the word says concerning that age your last the End of the Age works are more than the first the word thyra has various meanings amongst which is continual Sacrifice by many this is believed to be a prophecy concerning the use of the mass which is a continual presentation of the sacrifice of Christ that is an excellent thought but it might also mean the continual sacrifice in lives and labors of the True Believers of the Lord surely these thoy and Saints were the cream of the crop full of the Holy Ghost and Faith created unto good works showing forth his praise holding not their lives dear unto themselves but gladly giving all as their SE Sweet Sacrifice unto the Lord we'll go ahead and have the musicians come back you have as always the age of contrast seeing the holy up against the immoral and the filthy it's the darkest age that we go through and yet even in that there was that little bit of light and as with the law of contrast that little bit of light stood out all the brighter because of just how dark it was and God looked down and gave him the Acclaim that your works at the end of the age are even greater than your work at the beginning while other age talks about the love of many will wax cold and you begin to you lost your first love and these different things for this age God looks down and goes you did more at the end your Works were stronger you showed more love you did more in this age of absolute Darkness you were still able to stand there was still a light the light was never snuffed out as close as the devil thought that he got as close as he got to being completely in control and having everything gone yet at the same time God moves and goes hey I'm going to put a messenger over on those islands that are completely yours they're full of Druids they're full of unbelievers they're full of evil they're full of everything else so I'm going to raise up a man to go and bring my gospel there and then out of this land of Druids I'm going to raise up the messenger for the age I'm going to go directly into where you have full control and that's what our God does with Satan he goes this is Satan's Eden you have control but yet I can come down in the midst of that and I can pull out A Perfect Bride that's right in the midst of this age when you go and Everywhere You Look is perversion and Everywhere You Look is nastiness and Everywhere You Look is sexual immorality and Everywhere You Look is the woman being held up as the worst thing that could possibly be there and God looks down and goes in this age in this Darkness I'm going to come down and I'm going to pull out my bride amen and My bride is going to be clothed in white and My bride is going to be pure and My bride is going to be impregnated with my word and My bride is going to stand and be subject to my guidelines and be subject to my word and be subject to what I have this was the age of Darkness this was the age when Satan would look at it and think that he was so close to winning and yet God would still go down and go your works at the end are even better than how the age started you're doing even more now after going through all the persecution after going through all the punishment after going through everything that you have as evil as Jezebel is in this [Music] age yet still there's my light there's my children here and they're still standing out as a witness and we can see the same thing as we go into leod deia everything is Darkness but yet God allowed brother brandom to draw in just that little bit of light because he still had his bride and he still was going to bring out his Perfect Bride and we go through and we've all heard it said I'm sure about how brother brandom would just rail on the women and talk about how horrible they were and how awful they were and all these things but then at the same time he goes and goes but not you sisters this is what Holiness looks like this is what the absolute Jewel looks like it's that law of contrast and we see that being brought out as those two Vines continue to grow and continue to progress they're still side by side they're still going but the fruits are becoming more and more pronounced on both of them now I'm probably not quite as good at answering questions as brother Wendell I'm sure but does anyone have any comments or any questions after what we've been reading through this evening [Music] you think of questions later give them to brother Wendell he can answer later it'll be great Kobe what are we going to [Music] sing oh comes with the two drops of Mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the [Music] world walk in the light what a beautiful [Music] light where the drops of Mercy our right shine all around us thy day and by night Jesus the light of the [Music] world as we go make sure that you continue to remember the different needs that

as the place they evacuated to um so I'm sure they're not going to have the most comfortable night they don't all have their beds um but uh last I spoke with her storm had uh gone down to a three so it had weakened um and it was going in a little bit north of Sarasota um and if any of you have seen the radar there's almost no rain on the south side of the storm um almost all the rain is at the North and um so while there still will be plenty of strong winds um the concerns about flooding for them are a lot less now so that's that's a blessing um there'll still be some storm surge but pretty much everybody in the church lives far enough away from the coast that that's not a big problem but um if they don't get a lot of rains there's not a lot of flooding then they will be doing pretty well but um they're going to have an interesting night as the storm's going past so continue remember them in your prayers and remember all those that are that are in the p going [Music] through
