[9:40] scripture through prophecy Lord where we
[9:43] are today and and how that the Royal
[9:47] Seed of Abraham has Lord come down
[9:51] through all of the ages and Lord though
[9:54] Satan has tried to bring up his bride
[9:57] yet you've got a bride and we're so
[10:00] thankful Lord to to have this unveiling
[10:04] in our day Lord these other churches
[10:06] didn't understand what was going on Lord
[10:09] and yet they they gave their life Lord
[10:13] for the cuse that they believed in and
[10:17] here today Lord the cover's been taken
[10:20] off and and we can see exactly what
[10:24] every other age has has fought Lord it I
[10:28] I I pray that you not let us let it lead
[10:31] us to lukewarmness but to lead us to a a
[10:36] greater faith and fervency and
[10:39] enthusiasm Lord for your word oh God
[10:43] we're just asking that you would be with
[10:45] us
[10:46] tonight that you would reveal yourself
[10:48] to us as we read through the church ages
[10:51] Lord we uh ask that you would be with
[10:54] those that are sick tonight Lord that
[10:57] you would bring healing uh into their
[11:00] homes and we'll just give you glory and
[11:03] honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:05] Christ can the church say
[11:08] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[11:12] seated uh here today
[11:15] tonight and
[11:17] um uh we're here in the th tyan Church
[11:21] age and um um did you enjoy last
[11:25] Wednesday night brother Harry's reading
[11:28] and and
[11:31] um um the things that he brought out uh
[11:35] the other night was was just really
[11:37] wonderful and um and so um we we
[11:42] understand that amen that we're we're
[11:45] living in an incredible age
[11:49] because
[11:50] uh God sent a prophet to us to to reveal
[11:55] and the things that that he had done in
[11:58] s symbols and these the these these
[12:02] symbols um were put there uh
[12:07] to it it had to be written in in in Holy
[12:11] Scripture and it had to be done uh
[12:15] through prophecy he wanted you and me to
[12:17] know about it and if it wasn't written
[12:19] in the scripture then then uh uh we
[12:22] wouldn't know about it and um but at the
[12:25] same time it wasn't given for the for
[12:28] the other ages the 1 2 third fourth
[12:30] fifth 6th age it was given for us so he
[12:34] gives it he writes these things in a
[12:37] symbol form so when the other churches
[12:40] throughout the ages are looking at it
[12:43] it's it's they're reading the book but
[12:45] the Revelation is sealed up and so they
[12:49] they don't know what it means and today
[12:52] the nominal church still doesn't know
[12:53] what it means but yet here here we stand
[12:57] tonight and the the Holy Spirit but he
[13:00] but he promised now on these on these
[13:03] Mysteries and on these symbols and these
[13:06] things that had to come out he says I
[13:08] I'll send a prophet I'll do nothing
[13:11] except I send a prophet God will not
[13:14] reveal God will not show anything
[13:17] through a theologian he will not show
[13:20] anything amen any Divine mystery open
[13:24] any through a pastor through an
[13:26] evangelist or or even through a
[13:28] five-fold Ministry prophet he will only
[13:31] do it through that seventh or these one
[13:34] of these seven uh uh uh Angels one of
[13:38] these seven Messengers to the age it it
[13:41] didn't say that I I'm going to I'm going
[13:43] to send the Revelation down to all the
[13:45] pastors or I'm going to send all the
[13:47] Revelation down to all the evangelists
[13:50] but he says I will send it to each one
[13:53] of these ages as we looked at a couple
[13:56] weeks ago unto the angel of epis unto
[14:00] the angel every to singular Angel and
[14:03] then that Prophet would come amen and
[14:06] reveal the portion for each age amen he
[14:10] gave him that portion for each one of
[14:13] those but in our day it wasn't just a
[14:16] portion when the seventh angel comes and
[14:21] begins to sound the entire mystery of
[14:25] the church ages would be complete amen
[14:29] the book would be open and then you and
[14:32] I can come freely o through an open book
[14:36] and see where we are what we are who we
[14:40] are amen and how close we are to the
[14:44] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I I I
[14:47] think it's so beautiful and so uh you
[14:50] know and and when we we we can't we
[14:53] can't forget um uh as as brother
[14:57] brandham would tell us amen the book uh
[15:00] the you know the the Book of Revelation
[15:03] shows the two spirits that would be at
[15:06] work and so um it's easy we we've been
[15:09] doing doing this now for months and
[15:11] months and so we don't want to lose
[15:14] track because we we stopped we've we've
[15:16] we've covered a lot of Doctrine and and
[15:19] um and it's been a wonderful time but we
[15:21] want to catch what what what the spirit
[15:24] is doing down through these ages there
[15:26] are two Spirits there is the Spirit of
[15:29] the Antichrist and then there is the
[15:31] spirit of God there are two trees amen
[15:35] there there's the there's the false Vine
[15:38] and then there is the the the the real
[15:40] Vine uh brother brandom Ed again he used
[15:43] the uh uh uh the tree that God planted
[15:47] and then Satan comes in and and and he
[15:50] begins to put in a a graphs his own
[15:53] stuff his own religious tree and and
[15:56] living off the life of of Christianity
[16:00] living off the life of God but yet uh uh
[16:04] producing their own Works their own
[16:06] fruit so they can come to church amen
[16:10] under the name of Jesus Christ and and
[16:12] claim to be Christians using the same
[16:14] Bible and and do all of these things and
[16:17] still yet say that it's okay to be a
[16:20] transgender amen and deny the work say
[16:23] it's okay homosexual life is okay to to
[16:27] say it's okay to hate your brother it's
[16:29] okay uh uh you know to to to do all all
[16:33] of these things here and and what and
[16:35] what it is it is it is uh Satan who has
[16:39] grafted his own uh uh Branch onto the
[16:44] tree of Christ living off of the life of
[16:48] the holy spirit because we are all
[16:49] Spirit beings you're a spirit being I'm
[16:51] a spirit being the pope is a spirit
[16:53] being uh uh Hitler was a spirit being
[16:56] and so Satan has found a way way to be
[16:59] able to to take those spirits and cause
[17:03] people to enter into that Supernatural
[17:05] that spiritual real can live in a
[17:09] supernatural world and yet their souls
[17:12] be totally lost and and and and and they
[17:16] can can live vile and and and and live
[17:19] adulterous lives and and be fornicators
[17:22] and be this and liars and and all of
[17:26] these things here but God it doesn't
[17:28] take away from the TR there is that
[17:31] false woman that brother uh Harry uh
[17:33] beautifully brought out the other night
[17:35] amen she's a foul woman she's a
[17:38] she she's got daughters that are harlots
[17:41] she she's not living true to the words
[17:44] of God and the ways of God but brother
[17:47] but if you remember as brother brandham
[17:49] kept making the distinction but there is
[17:51] a holy one who represents everything
[17:54] pure represents everything perfect
[17:58] represents and that and and and so I'm
[18:00] glad tonight to to know that I I I am
[18:03] that elected lady that you are the
[18:06] elected the elected lady can you say
[18:08] Amen a and so amen the that Antichrist
[18:12] spirit is is has been there throughout
[18:15] all of these ages and and so I as we get
[18:20] ready to read now I want us to turn
[18:23] we're going to back up a little bit uh
[18:25] um to the uh page 22
[18:29] one and um we're going to start there at
[18:32] 1 2 3 4 the fourth
[18:35] paragraph um and we're not going to read
[18:39] uh the um the that 19th verse because we
[18:43] just read it to start out so we're just
[18:45] going to go on where it starts here
[18:49] again we we find the same introductory
[18:53] remarks I Know Thy works the Son of God
[18:57] himself said believe me for uh the very
[19:02] work sake he put an emphasis on his own
[19:06] Works while on earth now I I I want us
[19:09] to just really enjoy this here because
[19:12] it's it's he's fixing to show that The
[19:15] Works that Christ done gave him
[19:19] confidence in who he was the works and
[19:23] then he's going to turn around and show
[19:25] the very works of this bride
[19:29] is going should give you confidence to
[19:33] know who you are because it's the life
[19:36] of the vine coming through predestinated
[19:40] branches and whatever the root produced
[19:43] is what the branches producing now now
[19:46] he's going to he's going to separate you
[19:48] know works for salvation and the works
[19:50] of Christ within us I think this is
[19:52] beautiful so I want youall to really pay
[19:54] attention what you're reading amen he
[19:56] says the Son of God himself said believe
[19:59] me he's talking to everybody and says
[20:01] hey believe me because my works for my
[20:04] very work sake he put emphasis on his
[20:07] own Works while on Earth The Works he
[20:11] did were ordained God to inspire faith
[20:16] in him they were ordained to inspire
[20:21] faith in himself now watch what he says
[20:25] about you it was a great part of his
[20:27] ministry and his holy spirit in the
[20:30] Apostle Paul said for we are his
[20:33] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[20:36] good works which God has for ordained
[20:40] that we should walk in them Ephesians
[20:42] 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith
[20:47] in him as they would show forth the
[20:50] relationship to him that Paul described
[20:53] as created in him now works will never
[20:57] take the place of faith faith in God for
[20:59] our salvation but works will show forth
[21:03] our faith already placed in him good
[21:07] works won't save you but they will come
[21:10] forth out of a saved life as fruit unto
[21:13] the Lord I believe in good works if even
[21:17] if a man is not saved he ought to do
[21:19] good works and do the best he can what
[21:21] is horrible in the sight of God is for
[21:24] men to do evil works and then say they
[21:27] are doing the will of God and that is
[21:29] what the Bishops and popes and hierarchy
[21:33] and the hierarchy of Rome were doing
[21:35] they were killing maming doing all
[21:37] manner of evil in the name of the Lord
[21:40] they lived out lives exactly opposite to
[21:44] what the word teaches in that day those
[21:48] True Believers Shone like a light in a
[21:51] dark place now I I I I I think now
[21:55] there's there's really a lot of
[21:56] similarities here to to this age the th
[22:00] tyan age and the and the leosan age the
[22:04] th tyan age the lighted went to out s CA
[22:07] could you put that um uh the
[22:10] candlesticks up and I I want you to look
[22:13] the light was almost totally gone out of
[22:18] out of uh that that th tyan Age and and
[22:21] so uh now we're in the fourth Church age
[22:24] so you can see that light that thyon the
[22:29] darkness had had totally take over and
[22:31] then look at Le oosa now now that is
[22:35] shown there the way that the angel of
[22:37] the lord gave it to brother brandham
[22:39] totally blacked out and brother brandham
[22:42] you remember he asked the angel can I
[22:44] put a sliver of light in there for for
[22:47] the elect and uh uh and and and so the
[22:51] angel of the Lord said yes so he put a
[22:54] little sliver of light in that lots and
[22:56] agent which doesn't reflect there
[22:59] um um and I think it is in your regular
[23:02] Church age book let me look at it and
[23:03] just just see yes you you if you're if
[23:06] you look back there to to the front of
[23:08] your book you will have a little bit of
[23:11] light in in Leona but that's the way
[23:14] that it was first given where it was
[23:16] totally dark so the elect the elect is
[23:21] praise the Lord God's light to this age
[23:25] now I want us to to to really think of
[23:27] this as we look thyra now thyra they
[23:31] were dying this was the longest age of
[23:33] them all this they they went almost 1500
[23:37] Years brother murl asked me one time why
[23:40] why I had put the Dark Ages on
[23:43] thyra and brother bradam actually says
[23:46] that and I think we we we'll probably
[23:47] hit that tonight uh where where he says
[23:50] the the uh uh the thyra was the Dark
[23:54] Ages plural in other words it it just
[23:57] you know when the when they when they're
[23:59] making the reference uh theologians are
[24:01] making the reference they they talk
[24:03] about the Dark Ages and so brother
[24:05] Brandon was just saying that is that's
[24:07] the 1500 years of of of of Darkness now
[24:11] I believe that this church age here was
[24:14] how many years was that I I think it was
[24:16] n yeah 9914 years almost a thousand
[24:20] years was the age of thyra now they they
[24:23] killed and maimed and and and tried to
[24:26] destroy but but here in this age amen
[24:31] God or Satan has taken over another way
[24:35] he's not trying to kill and maim and
[24:38] Destroy naturally but he is coming
[24:42] spiritually and it is worked in such a
[24:45] way that when God showed brother brandom
[24:48] it was darker in this age than it was in
[24:51] the th tyan age now I want you to
[24:54] understand that but the elect of God
[24:57] will pre Prevail aren't you glad for
[25:00] that amen all right so let's go back to
[25:02] reading all right he says in in that day
[25:05] that evil day those True Believers Shone
[25:09] like a light in a dark place as they
[25:11] continually did good for they returned
[25:14] cursing with blessing and did the truth
[25:17] to honor God even though many died for
[25:20] it in this verse he is commending his
[25:23] children because they were living
[25:25] changed lives their works
[25:31] testified to a new spirit
[25:34] within men saw their works and glorified
[25:37] God yes sir if you are a Christian you
[25:40] are going to do what is right your Works
[25:43] will show that your heart is right it
[25:46] won't be something that you put on for
[25:49] you will do his will even when no one
[25:52] but God sees you and you will do his
[25:55] will even if it cost you your life now
[25:59] that's that's incredible he says I know
[26:02] your love service faith and patience you
[26:05] will note that their love is placed
[26:08] between works and service and that is
[26:11] the right place for it because without
[26:13] our love without love our works are not
[26:16] accepted before God and neither is our
[26:19] service God speaking to Corinthians said
[26:22] without love I am nothing and whatever I
[26:27] do is without profit unless it is done
[26:30] in love now you can see here that these
[26:34] Believers weren't in that nicadan class
[26:38] that did works as a mean of Salvation to
[26:41] be admired by men they did their works
[26:44] out of the love of God that was shed
[26:47] abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost
[26:51] and that love in their hearts was God's
[26:55] love for his own Jesus said by this
[26:57] shall shall all men know that you're my
[26:59] disciples that you have love for one
[27:02] another the pagans saw the lives of the
[27:05] early
[27:06] Christians and uh uh said behold how
[27:10] they love each other John said everyone
[27:13] that loveth is born of God 1 John
[27:17] 4:7 I want to give you a warning right
[27:20] here it says concerning the last days
[27:23] that because of the abounding of
[27:25] iniquity the love of many would wax cold
[27:28] in the layot of sinan or last age
[27:32] self-love and love for material things
[27:35] will take the place of the true love of
[27:39] God and we need to guard against the
[27:42] power of sin in these last days and
[27:45] that's the reason I have felt so
[27:46] compelled lately to just really go back
[27:48] to some of the basics and really strike
[27:50] those things home where is our love
[27:53] where is our fervency where are we
[27:56] putting things are is every everything
[27:58] in the proper order they've got to be in
[28:00] the proper order it must be God and God
[28:05] Alone can I hear an
[28:06] amen so many are getting so hard because
[28:11] they haven't realized the effect of this
[28:14] last day now think about that because
[28:17] the hardness the hardness of heart where
[28:20] you can't you can't enjoy your salvation
[28:23] you can't enjoy the Revelation if you
[28:26] can't enjoy the re
[28:28] Revelation the most beautiful of all
[28:31] ages with the greatest of Revelations of
[28:35] all ages and we come to church and it
[28:38] just seems like it seems like there's no
[28:41] energy or no no fervency to come back I
[28:45] wonder if we're truly catching what God
[28:49] is
[28:50] doing you hold the greatest
[28:54] revelation of any age Hallelujah right
[28:59] oh don't let the hardness of sin see the
[29:02] hardness we get hard and and the thing
[29:04] is is we and and we we have we it's just
[29:07] we go go go go we have to take care of
[29:10] our family we have to take care of our
[29:12] uh uh you know you you the children your
[29:14] husband and and and you husbands you're
[29:17] getting out early you're coming home
[29:18] you're wore out and and and all of this
[29:21] Amen in in in all of this normal natural
[29:25] activity we are fighting spirit of
[29:29] unbelief like no other
[29:32] age amen but there such such incredible
[29:36] Spirits brother bradam says when
[29:37] knowledge increased unbelief has just
[29:41] increased and started flooding in and
[29:43] we're and we're fighting these things in
[29:45] our minds we're fighting so hard and if
[29:49] we're not careful amen and if we don't
[29:51] keep that heart protected and we don't
[29:54] amen I really truly appreciate the old
[29:58] open book amen this coming to life if we
[30:02] don't appreciate that the gift that God
[30:06] gave you as a standard against the
[30:10] enemy will be putting on a shelf
[30:12] somewhere that's right amen and and and
[30:15] all of these rivers of unbelief are
[30:17] coming in against you and and and we'
[30:19] seen what happened uh uh with with uh
[30:22] what was it Halen amen were they swep
[30:25] they say there's still dozens of people
[30:26] swept away they don't they they're still
[30:28] looking for dozens they're missing amen
[30:30] swipe away and brother brandham use
[30:32] rivers of unbelief they're they're just
[30:34] they're coming in and they're just
[30:36] sweeping everybody away but brother but
[30:38] but when but brother Bram says when the
[30:40] when it said the spirit of the Lord
[30:42] shall raise up a standard he has come
[30:46] and lifted the revelation of his word in
[30:50] our hearts not our minds in our hearts
[30:55] so that we know where to stand and how
[30:58] to
[30:59] fight well can I hear an
[31:01] amen amen so so we we want to guard that
[31:07] amen
[31:08] he he says we must guard against the
[31:12] power of sin in these last days so many
[31:14] are getting so hard because they haven't
[31:18] realized the effect of this last day
[31:21] Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God
[31:24] and let him fill our lives with his love
[31:27] or we will feel the coldness of this
[31:29] last day church and reject the truth
[31:32] which alone is able to save us in those
[31:35] dark and Dreadful years the True Vine
[31:37] held its love for God and love for the
[31:40] Brethren love of the Brethren and God
[31:43] commended them for it I know your
[31:45] service Jesus said he that is greatest
[31:48] of all is servant to all a wise man
[31:53] commented on that saying here is what he
[31:56] said only history will prove the truth
[31:59] of that
[32:00] victim that man was right all the truly
[32:04] great men of history have been servants
[32:08] they who demanded to be served they who
[32:11] oppressed they who sought to always be
[32:13] at the head have gone down in shame even
[32:17] the very rich are condemned by God when
[32:19] they have not used their wealth right
[32:21] but look into history and you will find
[32:24] that the truly great were those who
[32:27] served others
[32:28] history can never Acclaim those for whom
[32:32] much was
[32:33] done but it will forever praise those
[32:37] who did much for others let us apply
[32:40] that to ourselves even as the son of man
[32:43] came not to be ministered unto but to
[32:47] minister so we are to follow that
[32:50] example we see him as he bows himself
[32:53] over the feet of the Apostles and washes
[32:56] their tired and dirty feet
[32:58] he said you don't know what I'm doing
[33:01] now what I'm doing but you will know
[33:03] Hereafter but what you see me doing you
[33:07] ought to do also he became a servant in
[33:10] order that God could Elevate him to the
[33:14] highest Heights oh what a lesson today
[33:18] if you want to be if you want to if you
[33:20] want to be great with God be a
[33:23] servant amen I I I'm always talking
[33:26] about being a servant
[33:28] amen having servants Hearts I I would
[33:31] rather have a servant's heart I I I
[33:33] would rather be the low man on the totem
[33:35] Poe every time if I'm the low man on the
[33:37] totem Poe that means I am pushing others
[33:40] up I can't do too much when I'm when I'm
[33:42] down or when I'm on top trying to to get
[33:45] you on top of me but what if I can be on
[33:48] the bottom of the of the ladder and push
[33:50] it up when I when I I I I have had I've
[33:53] had I I I've had I remember Aaron being
[33:56] up there uh he up on on a uh on a roof
[34:00] helping me and uh you remember that
[34:03] Aaron and and uh I I would be down there
[34:05] below him and and making sure he wasn't
[34:08] going to fall and helping him pushing
[34:09] him all the way on up you know and he
[34:11] was scared spitless and uh but after he'
[34:14] done it for a while uh he he he enjoyed
[34:17] it and he felt like a man amen you he
[34:19] was a he was a little Tau but uh uh but
[34:22] I I you see when when that's the way
[34:24] that we should all be with one another
[34:27] amen it's not that I get ahead my desire
[34:31] is that you get ahead it's not that my
[34:34] My Rewards will be on the on the other
[34:36] side and so will yours be on the other
[34:40] side as long as we do that and you know
[34:42] what I think there's still plenty of
[34:45] room to shine good Christian Light and
[34:48] little churches can do that little
[34:51] communities like this can do that
[34:52] because we're really aen we we're like
[34:55] we're all a big family and if we have
[34:57] that kind of a thought toward one
[34:59] another and have that kind of a thought
[35:01] towards the community you have the
[35:03] ability to shine an incredible light in
[35:08] this 2500 people because well it's La
[35:11] fishing in a lake and and a big old huge
[35:14] uh lake with 350 acres and fishing in a
[35:17] pond amen you're fishing in a pond well
[35:19] you ain't got too those fish ain't got
[35:21] too many places they can go to hide
[35:23] whereas if you've got a 350 acre Lake
[35:26] amen you you know
[35:28] they don't know if your boat's there or
[35:29] not there so here in little communities
[35:32] like this amen we have a privilege to
[35:37] really Express
[35:41] Jesus amen thinking last night uh um you
[35:46] know some of the some of the stuff come
[35:48] from Anita Franks and then others come
[35:51] from Susan Spears and and these and one
[35:54] of them um uh um Anita is is a Mormon I
[35:59] believe she comes she's the Mormon faith
[36:00] and I think Suzanne Spears is she's
[36:03] Episcopalian or or or something like
[36:06] that and uh and and they have the
[36:08] highest of praise for for all of you
[36:11] here and I and I was thinking about that
[36:14] and I thought oh God let us live live
[36:18] such a life and be such an expression
[36:22] not of the human nature but of God's
[36:25] nature and that's what brother brandom
[36:26] is saying we don't want to express
[36:29] ourselves but it's the Living spirit on
[36:32] the inside of us that has produced a a a
[36:35] servant's heart and a servant's heart
[36:38] goes above and beyond and loving and
[36:40] giving and so that his Spirit can be
[36:43] reflected through US amen all
[36:48] right
[36:50] now let's see
[36:53] [Music]
[36:55] here um he says but now let us apply to
[36:57] ourselves even the son of man came not
[37:00] to be ministered unto but to minister so
[37:03] we are to follow that example we uh see
[37:06] him as he
[37:07] bows himself over the feet of the
[37:10] Apostles washing their feet uh tired and
[37:12] dirty feet and said you do not know what
[37:15] I'm doing but you will know Hereafter
[37:18] but what you see me doing you ought also
[37:20] to do he become a servant in order that
[37:23] God could Elevate him to the highest
[37:25] Heights and one day in judgment of the
[37:27] Saints we are going to hear him say Well
[37:30] done good and faithful
[37:33] servant a capital servant even enter
[37:37] thou into the joy of the Lord it is hard
[37:40] to always be a servant but those who
[37:43] Spin and are spent for others will one
[37:46] day be seated with him in his throne it
[37:50] will be worth it all then let us labor
[37:53] for the master from the Dawn Till
[37:55] Setting Sun let us talk of all his
[37:58] wondrous love and care when all of life
[38:01] is over and our work on Earth is done
[38:03] and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be
[38:06] there he says I know your faith he does
[38:10] not say here as he did to the church in
[38:13] pergamus you hold my faith he's not
[38:17] talking about his faith now he's
[38:19] commending them for their faithfulness
[38:21] as he does he also mentions their
[38:24] patience now faithfulness and patience
[38:27] go together in fact patience is the
[38:30] outcome of faithfulness for he says in
[38:33] James 1 and3 the trying of your faith
[38:36] Works patience there is absolutely no
[38:39] other way in which to gain patience it
[38:43] has to come by the trial of your faith
[38:47] Romans 5 and3 tribulation Works patience
[38:50] how highly God re regards the outworking
[38:55] of our patience as SE in James 1 and 4
[38:59] now I I want to read it again how highly
[39:03] God
[39:04] regs this outworking coming from the
[39:08] inside working out our patience as seen
[39:11] in James 1 and4 let patience have her
[39:14] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[39:16] entire lacking nothing God's will is for
[39:20] uh for us is perfection and that
[39:23] Perfection is patience waiting on God
[39:26] waiting before God this is the process
[39:29] of character development how highly God
[39:32] has commended these Saints of the Dark
[39:34] Ages patient as Lambs led to the
[39:37] slaughter lovingly Faithfully they
[39:39] served God that is that is all they
[39:42] wanted out of life just service to their
[39:45] lord how great was to be their reward
[39:48] isn't that isn't that your desire
[39:50] too just all you want out of life is
[39:54] just service to the Lord amen
[39:57] I Know Thy works and the last to be more
[40:01] than the first this is certainly
[40:03] remarkable as the darkness of the age
[40:06] increased as the honor role of the
[40:08] martyrs grew lengthier day by day they
[40:11] worked all the harder they served all
[40:14] the more their faith increased how
[40:18] tragic it was for the Ephesian
[40:21] age uh in that the F fision age waned
[40:25] and truly nothing is said of the
[40:28] increased labor of love in the other
[40:30] ages but in this age in the darkest of
[40:34] all ages oh think about your AG Le osia
[40:37] they served him even more now I want to
[40:41] read it to you again how tragic it was
[40:43] that in the Ephesian age love waned
[40:46] truly nothing is said of the increased
[40:48] labor of love in the other ages but in
[40:51] this age the darkest of Ages they served
[40:54] him even more what a lesson this is
[40:57] there is no ceasing of that gracious
[40:59] service of Love unto the Lord but rather
[41:01] an increasing of it that is the secret
[41:05] let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[41:08] service to the Lord our reply is
[41:11] increased service when the faint are
[41:15] crying in fear this is the time to shout
[41:18] the victory can you say Amen now now you
[41:22] you want to know man this goes right
[41:24] along with what I've been saying you've
[41:26] been sick Satan's trying to keep you out
[41:28] of church that is your time to say no
[41:32] amen uh uh page 15 in in the church age
[41:37] book over here in the 15th brother uh uh
[41:43] um it says um he says let me let me just
[41:48] give you a word here for my own Ministry
[41:50] if you don't mind you all know that this
[41:52] gift in my life is Supernatural it is a
[41:54] gift whereby the holy spirit is able to
[41:56] discern Jesus and the thoughts of men's
[41:58] hearts and other hidden things that only
[42:00] God could know and then reveal to me I
[42:02] wish you could stand with me and see the
[42:04] faces of the people when Satan knows he
[42:06] is going to be exposed now it isn't the
[42:09] people that I'm talking about it is
[42:10] Satan has a hold in their lives through
[42:13] sin indifference and disease but you
[42:15] should see their faces Satan knows he's
[42:18] going to be exposed and the most
[42:21] peculiar changes come over the people's
[42:22] countenances Satan is afraid he knows
[42:25] the spirit of God is about to let the
[42:27] people know of his works I should have
[42:29] waited for y'all to read with me this is
[42:31] why he hates meetings like this when
[42:33] names are called and diseases revealed
[42:35] Satan hates it now what is this it is
[42:38] not mind reading it is not telepathy or
[42:40] witchcraft it is Revelation by the holy
[42:44] ghost that is the only way I can know it
[42:47] of course the carnal mind will call it
[42:49] anything but the Holy Ghost now now now
[42:52] he's talking about he's talking about
[42:53] the Book of Revelations and he's saying
[42:55] if you notice in the me ings this Spirit
[42:58] of Revelation that is upon me when when
[43:01] Satan knows that he is
[43:04] exposed and the Revelation comes to
[43:07] those people those people are free from
[43:12] that
[43:13] devil they they they can they can see it
[43:16] clearly as as as the spirit of the Lord
[43:19] is Discerning and then the next
[43:21] paragraph if y'all want to read it uh
[43:23] catch up with me over here in in page 15
[43:26] he says now
[43:28] uh uh 15 there in um uh the the last
[43:34] paragraph he says now remember this
[43:36] Christ in the true church is a
[43:39] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[43:40] Book of Revelation shows how the
[43:42] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[43:44] church defile it making it lukewarm
[43:47] formal and Powerless but it exposes
[43:51] Satan revealing his works the attempted
[43:54] destruction of God's people and the
[43:56] discrediting of God's word right down to
[43:58] the time he has cast in the Lake of Fire
[44:01] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[44:03] knows that if the people get the true
[44:06] revelation of the true church and what
[44:09] she is and what she stands for she can
[44:11] do the Greater Works she will be an
[44:14] invincible Army if they get a true
[44:17] revelation of the two spirits in the
[44:21] framework of the Christian church and by
[44:24] God's spirit discern and Wiis stand the
[44:28] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[44:32] what powerless before her he will be as
[44:36] thwarted that today as when Jesus with
[44:39] stod his effort every effort to gain
[44:42] power over him in the desert yes Satan
[44:44] hates Revelation but we love it with the
[44:48] true Revelation in our lives the Gates
[44:50] of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[44:55] will prevail over them that's what God
[44:57] has given us I know he hits us with his
[45:00] sickness I know he's doing it everywhere
[45:02] I I I I don't like seeing Christians
[45:05] with their tail between their legs and
[45:07] and and just walking out and letting
[45:08] Satan get the best of
[45:12] you fight that devil amen I'm not trying
[45:16] to say be goody two shoes and well well
[45:19] this one's that made it to church and
[45:20] that one didn't and so man we are that
[45:22] no I'm not this ain't legalism at all
[45:24] I'm teaching you how to fight that's
[45:27] right I'm saying I'm saying when the
[45:29] devil is putting it on you then you need
[45:32] to resist him 1 million times and fight
[45:35] him that much the harder and if he's
[45:36] trying to keep you out of church baby
[45:38] you ain't keeping me out of church
[45:40] anymore I'm going to stand my grounds
[45:42] against you and you're going to you're
[45:44] going to find out that that revelation
[45:46] will have power over that stupid thing
[45:49] that is trying to keep you under its
[45:53] Thum the devil keeps on doing the same
[45:55] thing with with with with with Lust For
[45:58] You boys fight it and how do you do it
[46:02] you you you you get to yourself grab the
[46:06] word of God take the revelation of this
[46:09] day get into prayer and you watch what
[46:12] the devil is doing now or or you you
[46:14] you'll see what the devil is doing and
[46:15] be able to defeat now that the brother
[46:18] bradam says those
[46:20] Believers had that Revelation without
[46:24] the opening of the book that's right
[46:27] they had that Revelation there was no
[46:30] one there was there was no one there to
[46:32] encourage them and say keep on you've
[46:35] got the open book they just simply had
[46:38] something deep down in their heart that
[46:40] they were going to resist that old devil
[46:43] that was trying to take the love of God
[46:45] out of their out of their
[46:48] bosom leoty has lost a lot of resistance
[46:51] they resisting the word of God instead
[46:53] of resisting the powers of Satan and
[46:56] that's what we're needing to do the
[46:58] resist anything that'll well praise the
[47:01] Lord any devil that that tries to put
[47:03] that that's trying to put a a cold
[47:06] blanket on my hot love for the Lord
[47:09] anything that is trying to take away my
[47:11] joy take away my peace take away my love
[47:13] take away my health take away my family
[47:16] take away my husband take away my
[47:17] children I am going to
[47:22] resist amen can you say Amen
[47:27] now now again let let's go back to uh
[47:30] page
[47:31] 224 and and let's start there at the
[47:33] second verse uh uh second uh paragraph
[47:36] again it says I Know Thy works and the
[47:39] last more than the first this is
[47:41] remarkable as the darkness of the age
[47:44] increased as the honor role of Martyrs
[47:47] grew lengthier day by day they worked
[47:50] all the harder they served all the more
[47:53] their faith increased how tragic it was
[47:56] for the Vision sh uh age love waned and
[48:00] truly nothing is said of the increased
[48:02] labor of love in the other ages but in
[48:05] this age in the darkest of all they
[48:07] served him with even more what a lesson
[48:10] that is there is no ceasing of this
[48:14] gracious service of Love unto the Lord
[48:16] but rather an increasing of it that is
[48:18] the secret let the enemy attempt to for
[48:21] our service to the Lord our reply is
[48:23] increased service when the faint are
[48:25] crying in fear that is the time to shout
[48:28] Victory he says I Know Thy works and the
[48:30] last is more than the first now as we
[48:33] have already said this age is the Dark
[48:36] Ages because it was indeed the darkest
[48:40] period of all history it was the age of
[48:43] Pope Innocent 3 who claimed that he was
[48:45] the viker of Christ Supreme Sovereign
[48:47] over the church and the world who
[48:49] instituted the Inquisition which under
[48:53] his Direction shed more blood than at
[48:56] any other time time except in the
[48:58] Reformation it was the age of uh
[49:00] pornocracy the rule of harlots sagis
[49:04] three had a mistress and filled the
[49:07] paple choir with uh paramor and bastard
[49:11] sons and turned the paple palace into a
[49:13] Dean a den of robbers anastasius 3 was
[49:18] smothered to death by Moriah who was
[49:21] mistress to
[49:23] Saras John 11 was
[49:27] uh moraz illegitimate son John 12 was
[49:32] the grandson of uh marazia and he
[49:35] violated widows and virgins and was
[49:38] killed while in the act of adultery by
[49:40] the woman's enraged uh husband in the
[49:43] age of papism for two lines of popes one
[49:47] ruling uh from abidan and the other from
[49:51] Rome cursed and fought each other these
[49:54] popes were not only guilty of immoral
[49:56] sex acts fing scores of illegitimate
[49:58] children committing sodomy and Etc but
[50:01] were guilty of selling Priestly offices
[50:04] to the highest bitters it was the age
[50:07] when the light glowed ever so faintly
[50:09] yet the few Believers labored more
[50:14] fervently as the darkness increased
[50:17] until the until toward the end of the
[50:19] age many arose attempting reforms their
[50:21] labors were so fervent that they paved
[50:25] the way for the oncoming Reformation
[50:28] therefore as the word says concerning
[50:29] this age your last the End of the Age
[50:32] works are more than the first the word
[50:36] thra and again and again the the darker
[50:39] it goes amen the more fervently they
[50:42] were and look at our age we have we have
[50:46] an opportunity to shine like no other
[50:49] Age come on now and the only way you're
[50:52] going to do it is now anybody can go to
[50:54] church anyone can sing anyone can do do
[50:56] those things but the spirit of the Lord
[51:00] within you him performing himself
[51:03] through you is what he is after amen now
[51:06] he says the word thara has various
[51:10] meanings amongst which continual uh
[51:13] which is continual Sacrifice by many
[51:17] this is believed to be a prophecy
[51:19] concerning the use of the mass which is
[51:21] continual presentation of the sacrifice
[51:23] of Christ that is an excellent thought
[51:26] but it might also mean the continual
[51:28] sacrifice in lives and labors of the
[51:31] True Believers of the Lord surely these
[51:33] tharan saints were the cream of the crop
[51:36] full of the Holy Ghost in faith created
[51:39] under good works showing forth his
[51:41] praise holding not their lives dear unto
[51:45] themselves but gladly giving their all
[51:48] as a Sweet Sacrifice unto the Lord the
[51:52] rebuke Revelations 20 and 20 uh 2 and 20
[51:56] not with understanding I have a few
[51:57] things against thee because thou
[51:59] sufferest tolerate that woman Jezebel
[52:03] which calls herself a prophet us to
[52:05] teach and to seduce my servants to
[52:07] commit fornication and to eat things
[52:10] sacrificed to Idols now with this verse
[52:14] I want to drop down to the 23rd and see
[52:17] the proof of the great truth of a great
[52:19] truth I have been bringing to your
[52:21] attention all along I will kill her
[52:24] children with Death and All all the
[52:26] churches shall know that I am he which
[52:30] searches the Reigns and hearts I have
[52:32] been saying right along that there are
[52:34] actually two churches though the spirit
[52:37] speaks to both of them in each age as
[52:41] though they were but one here it is
[52:43] plainly stated that there are churches
[52:46] it it and it states just as plainly that
[52:50] some of those churches most EV evidently
[52:53] do not know that he is the one who
[52:55] searches Reigns in the hearts he is
[52:58] going to prove to them that it is
[53:01] so now now then when the what churches
[53:05] will be those uh that do not know this
[53:08] truth of course it is the false Vine
[53:10] group because the True Believers
[53:12] certainly know the judgment begins at
[53:14] the house of God and they being
[53:17] God-fearing judging themselves uh that
[53:21] they be not judged now why does God call
[53:24] these churches his churches even though
[53:26] they are the false Vine the truth of the
[53:29] matter
[53:30] is they are Christians but they are not
[53:33] Christians of the spirit they are
[53:36] Christians of the flesh they are bearing
[53:38] the name in vain Mark 7:7 how be it in
[53:42] vain they do worship me teaching for
[53:44] doctrines the Commandments of G of of
[53:47] men but indeed they are Christians for
[53:49] what else could they be a muhammadan is
[53:53] a muhammadan that is his religion no
[53:55] matter how he lives because it
[53:57] subscribes in in theory to what the
[54:00] Quran teaches in the same way a
[54:02] Christian is a Christian as long as he
[54:04] subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the
[54:06] son of God born of a virgin was
[54:08] crucified and died and rose again that
[54:11] he is the savior of mankind Etc in fact
[54:14] in the Le Osan age there will be those
[54:16] who call themselves Christians because
[54:19] they subscribe to the Fine qualities of
[54:21] Jesus while reserving to themselves the
[54:25] right to deny his deity Christian
[54:27] Scientists have done that already as
[54:30] well as multitudes who preach a social
[54:31] gospel he is a nominal Christian and
[54:34] belongs to the church but he is not a
[54:38] true spiritual believer that kind of a
[54:41] Believer is one who has been baptized
[54:44] into the body of Christ and is a member
[54:46] of him but nonetheless it is it is in
[54:50] God's order that the tears grow up with
[54:52] the wheat and there are uh and they are
[54:55] not to be U rooted that is the command
[54:57] of God their day for binding and burning
[55:00] is coming but not yet so the spirit is
[55:03] speaking to the mixed group on one hand
[55:06] he is praising on the other hand he is
[55:09] rebuking he has told what is right with
[55:12] the True Believer and now he wants the
[55:14] false Vine uh he uh he warns what the
[55:18] false Vine must do if it is to stand
[55:21] Justified before the Lord can you say
[55:24] Amen now now the the it's a it's
[55:30] it's we we never want to
[55:35] um never never never again going back to
[55:39] harden never let your heart get so
[55:43] hardened
[55:45] that that the word coming across the
[55:47] pull pit the word you're reading in your
[55:50] devotions and the spirit of the Lord
[55:52] that deals with your heart when you're
[55:54] outside these doors when he's speaking
[55:57] to
[55:59] you never let your heart get so hardened
[56:03] that you can
[56:04] ignore what the spirit of the Lord is if
[56:06] he's dealing with you and telling you
[56:08] you've got to stop something stop
[56:12] now don't don't prolong something and
[56:15] keep something going on that that's the
[56:18] spirit of the Antichrist it was it it
[56:22] it's the spirit it's that Antichrist
[56:24] spirit that is fixed to take over now
[56:27] now now listen we're living in the day
[56:29] as as as as we've said the the the man
[56:32] of sin is fixing to make a a covenant
[56:35] with the
[56:36] Jews I mean the Jews are fixing the the
[56:38] the the the stage is getting set to
[56:41] where the man of sin will will be the
[56:44] one that is that that is going to make
[56:46] this and and
[56:47] remember brother brother bradam says now
[56:50] there was the um he says there was the
[56:52] Antichrist Spirit then there was the
[56:55] false prophet and he says and then he's
[56:57] going to Incarnate himself in a man and
[57:01] he will become a beast so so that spirit
[57:05] is here that spirit is a prophet and
[57:09] it's teaching you to go against this
[57:12] just as God's holy spirit has sent us a
[57:15] prophet to to teach us to come back to
[57:19] the word are y'all understanding so so
[57:21] when the Holy
[57:23] Spirit that's that's the reason why I I
[57:25] I say it's it's those little foxes that
[57:28] spoil the vine if the spirit of the Lord
[57:30] says something in his word don't push it
[57:34] another day don't push it another minute
[57:39] obey the spirit of the Lord stay behind
[57:43] that fortification and you can't fail
[57:46] that's right but I
[57:50] promise promise p r o m i s e I promise
[57:55] if you go about things your own way you
[58:00] will
[58:04] fail 100% you're going to
[58:09] fail well I just don't I don't think it
[58:12] matters brother Wendell he knows my
[58:14] heart come on we're not legalistic if
[58:16] the scripture gives you something and
[58:18] the Holy Spirit is correcting you and
[58:20] it's coming across the pull pit either
[58:22] by tape or behind the pull pit here and
[58:24] it's given to you by scripture don't
[58:26] question it obey it
[58:30] am now Authority remember uh uh I I read
[58:37] it two Wednesday nights ago where where
[58:40] where brother bradam says we would it
[58:42] would be the spirit of lawlessness that
[58:45] would rule in this last day remember the
[58:48] spirit and that's the time that's the
[58:50] place where he's calling his bride out
[58:54] of this lawlessness there's a bride who
[58:58] is submissive to him that that's that's
[59:00] the Paradox that's that's what is so
[59:03] crazy is while the world is filled with
[59:07] this Antichrist spirit yet the bride has
[59:10] got a softness toward him that is saying
[59:13] thy will be done in my life I want you
[59:18] to Lead Me Guide Me protect me I want
[59:22] your covering over me can you say Amen
[59:26] yes so that's what the spirit of the
[59:29] Lord is doing and there's where you
[59:31] young people are so stinking blessed
[59:35] amen you you're blessed to have to to to
[59:39] have the words of Life given to you and
[59:42] to show you how to overcome and I

[1:00:03] why we come to church and then and and
[1:00:05] and and you hear it across the pull pit
[1:00:07] but but don't don't live a double
[1:00:09] standard life Mom and Daddy when you're
[1:00:10] going outside the doors there and you

[1:00:20] through your
[1:00:23] lives not your opinions well well I I
[1:00:26] don't believe I and so listen I don't
[1:00:29] want my kids acting like me as if I'm

[1:01:20] um and and so I thought that I would
[1:01:23] take take this portion here after after
[1:01:26] God gives amen uh he's he's making a
[1:01:29] he's setting the stage he's setting the
[1:01:31] stage that here here here is the false
[1:01:35] and here is the true and the false will
[1:01:38] always persecute the
[1:01:40] true how does the how does the false
[1:01:43] persecute the true well back then they
[1:01:46] were killing them they they were killing

[1:03:50] pray it's going to be hard and we're
[1:03:53] defending our rights and then when we
[1:03:55] pray
[1:03:56] we can't feel his presence come to
[1:03:59] church it's just another service others
[1:04:02] are being blessed but we can't be
[1:04:04] blessed because you have been hardened
[1:04:07] by the deceitfulness of sin that's
[1:04:10] scripture hardened by the deceitfulness
[1:04:13] of
[1:04:14] sin the open book has shown us how Satan
[1:04:22] works we are Overcomers because God God
[1:04:25] has been so faithful in this last day to
[1:04:28] open that Bible and tell us exactly
[1:04:31] where Satan's Playbook is aren't you
[1:04:34] glad for that hallelujah amen the first
[1:04:38] remember under those seals it was that
[1:04:40] white horse a and and he was a deceiver
[1:04:43] and that and and and remember that same
[1:04:45] Rider jumps off that horse and comes on
[1:04:48] to the red horse and then that Rider
[1:04:51] it's the same Rider he jumps off of that
[1:04:54] horse and jumps onto the black horse and
[1:04:56] then that Rider jumps off the Black
[1:04:58] Horse and comes to the Pale Horse and
[1:05:00] remember the prophet taught us that the
[1:05:02] Pale Horse is a mixture of the white and
[1:05:05] the red and the black so all of the
[1:05:08] powers that were in the White Horse all
[1:05:11] of the powers that was in the red horse
[1:05:13] all of the powers that was in the black
[1:05:15] horse is now on this Pale Horse and that
[1:05:19] same demon that that has that has been
[1:05:22] plaguing the church through these 2,000
[1:05:24] years he's got all of the powers of hell
[1:05:27] right here right now and he's trying to
[1:05:30] fight every one of you and yet God says
[1:05:32] I'm going to have a bride without spot
[1:05:34] wrinkle or blemish God says I'm going to
[1:05:37] take a bride she's going to be my very
[1:05:40] own how is he going to do it he has
[1:05:43] given us his
[1:05:45] word oh how many loves him here tonight
[1:05:50] amen if the musicians would
[1:05:52] come amen love him tonight
[1:05:57] so
[1:05:58] we we we want to draw close to him soft
[1:06:04] Spirits soft Spirits attracts you to God
[1:06:07] now remember uh um I believe I believe
[1:06:12] it was the sermon was titled the ark and
[1:06:16] um is that right is there is there a
[1:06:18] sermon titled the
[1:06:21] ark amen I I thought it was may maybe
[1:06:25] maybe it's
[1:06:27] not
[1:06:30] hallelujah
[1:06:31] amen I want to use a phone for what it's
[1:06:34] supposed to be used for
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:39] amen there is a title named The
[1:06:44] Ark so so there is the the ark and
[1:06:47] brother brandom goes through there
[1:06:50] talking about and he and he and he and
[1:06:52] he talks about how
[1:06:53] that the ark was made of of uh pliable
[1:06:58] wood and and and and that's something
[1:07:01] that um um I I think it would do us all
[1:07:04] good it's it's a real it's a real good
[1:07:06] message but but he but when he when he
[1:07:08] was when he was making this Battleship
[1:07:11] when he was when he was making this
[1:07:13] thing that was going to survive all of
[1:07:15] the
[1:07:16] Judgment he took the most
[1:07:19] porous and softest of wood he took that
[1:07:24] soft wood
[1:07:26] to make this Battleship out of and
[1:07:29] brother Brandon says it don't even seem
[1:07:33] it don't even seem logical it don't seem
[1:07:35] wise at all but God told him to cut down
[1:07:40] the AA tree uh uh uh or um
[1:07:45] um anyways uh C cut down the tree and
[1:07:50] and then he was then he was to take the
[1:07:51] evergreen tree and he was to beat that
[1:07:54] evergreen tree
[1:07:56] and and get all the resin out of the
[1:07:59] Evergreen heat it up and then pour it
[1:08:03] over that porous wood now now that soft
[1:08:07] wood it would soak up anything it it
[1:08:10] would soak up water it would soak
[1:08:11] whatever you would put on it so he had
[1:08:14] to be careful in building this and then
[1:08:16] and then he would pitch it with with
[1:08:19] that with that resin or that that uh sap
[1:08:24] out of the evergreen tree
[1:08:26] and it soaked it all up in
[1:08:28] it and then it made it it made it
[1:08:32] indestructible did matter if it hit
[1:08:34] rocks didn't matter if it hit this or
[1:08:36] that as it's it's going through the
[1:08:37] waters logs were to hit it it was it was
[1:08:41] indestructible and God has made his
[1:08:45] church he's taken soft pliable Hearts
[1:08:50] not hard not men that women that's
[1:08:53] demanding their own rights not boys and
[1:08:55] girls I'm going to do it my I'm going to
[1:08:56] demand my way yeah no one's going to
[1:08:59] hurt me listen if you got the blood of
[1:09:01] Jesus that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:09:02] Christ is there for is to cover over all
[1:09:04] the bruises and all the hurts and the
[1:09:06] fiery darts right we we don't want to we
[1:09:09] don't want to be
[1:09:10] resistant he takes those soft our soft
[1:09:15] hearts that the devil can come in and
[1:09:18] fill it with
[1:09:20] pornography you can feel it with bad
[1:09:23] music you Bo that you got your phones or

[1:10:00] church some people said in the
[1:10:06] community a a Christian and I and I

[1:10:23] letting my boys go to public school so
[1:10:24] they can be
[1:10:26] witness and I said I believe in
[1:10:29] protecting my
[1:10:31] sons and these young

[1:11:59] opportunity in your
[1:12:01] home to shut the
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:06] door kneel down before God and I still
[1:12:10] believe that good oldfashioned kneeling
[1:12:11] down is
[1:12:13] appropriate kneel down and say Lord
[1:12:16] here's my
[1:12:19] heart don't let the devil Harden
[1:12:22] me I want your presence in me
[1:12:26] I want you to forgive me of my

[1:12:35] thoughts clean me up and forgive
[1:12:39] me and he's always Johnny on the spot
[1:12:42] he'll forgive you he'll forgive you but
[1:12:45] don't stop
[1:12:47] there say
[1:12:49] Lord I want you to show yourself to
[1:12:53] me I want to be a light
[1:12:55] I want your spirit in me I want your
[1:12:58] word to live in
[1:13:00] me I want a relationship with
[1:13:03] [Music]
[1:13:07] you and you might sit around and you
[1:13:09] might
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] think hello are you
[1:13:16] there and you might not feel
[1:13:20] him and the reason is is because of the
[1:13:23] hardness of this AG
[1:13:27] age you've already got a lot of junk you
[1:13:29] got all your games you've got your
[1:13:30] videos you've got you you guys have have
[1:13:32] watched movies you've got and you've
[1:13:34] already sitting down there before God
[1:13:36] and you're finding yourself hardened
[1:13:40] already at Young
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:44] ages but you guys are going to hit the
[1:13:46] age where you're going to need God to
[1:13:47] help you to overcome lust
[1:13:51] lying
[1:13:53] stealing you're going to deep G and the
[1:13:55] only way that God's going to be able to
[1:13:58] help
[1:13:59] you is if you've got a soft
[1:14:02] heart and that
[1:14:04] means quit putting the things of this
[1:14:07] world in you while you're
[1:14:09] young and take
[1:14:11] advantage of spending time with God at
[1:14:15] this early
[1:14:17] age that's why that's why you children
[1:14:19] get to stay home that's why you children
[1:14:22] get to have a home life you're not torn
[1:14:24] from pillar to poting up and gone you
[1:14:26] know out out early in the morning no
[1:14:28] while you're young you're still home get
[1:14:31] get get your get your Bible out spend
[1:14:33] time prayer mama don't be out shopping
[1:14:35] all the
[1:14:36] time don't take that away from these
[1:14:38] kids while they're
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:47] young you know I prayed with Mom and Dad
[1:14:51] all the time and it was fine
[1:14:56] but I got to tell you some of my best of
[1:15:00] praying as a kid and even now is when
[1:15:03] I'm by
[1:15:05] myself and I'll go shut the
[1:15:08] door hard for me to kneel on my knees
[1:15:11] anymore will
[1:15:13] arthritis in
[1:15:15] them I'll just sit I'll sit down when
[1:15:18] y'all see me praying I most of the time
[1:15:19] I'm sitting down instead of
[1:15:23] kneeling but it is still a sign of
[1:15:25] surrender that's
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:30] right and I just talk to the Lord Lord I
[1:15:32] I I want
[1:15:35] you and here's the
[1:15:37] deal if you don't feel it the first time
[1:15:39] you kneel down to pray we don't go by
[1:15:42] feelings but I am here to tell you there
[1:15:44] is a difference in praying and praying
[1:15:47] there is a difference in just saying
[1:15:48] words and then entering into the
[1:15:50] presence of God to where you know you're
[1:15:52] there and you you listen your soul can
[1:15:56] feel it there there there is an
[1:15:58] expression that begins to take hold you
[1:16:00] know when you're in the presence of God
[1:16:02] it's not just uttering words and many
[1:16:05] many many many many don't know how to
[1:16:07] enter
[1:16:08] in they just want to do it
[1:16:11] legalistically okay all right I'll give

[1:16:15] everything I need to tell you and then
