[0:00] Without thou me
[0:02] in thy secret place
[0:06] there may I find
[0:09] your mercy and grace.
[0:14] Place your seal up
[0:17] my heart's door.
[0:21] I may not sing
[0:24] against thee. Oh Lord,
[0:28] please hide thou me
[0:32] thy secret place.
[0:36] There may I find
[0:39] your mercy
[0:41] grace.
[0:43] Place your seal above
[0:47] my heart.
[0:51] I would not sin
[0:54] against thee, oh Lord.
[0:58] Place your sill upon
[1:02] my heart
[1:05] that I would not sin
[1:09] against thee, oh Lord.
[1:20] How alone I was feeling
[1:25] [Music]
[1:26] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[1:31] hide.
[1:33] Though I laughed and said my life was
[1:37] fine without you.
[1:42] I was covering up those secret tears. I
[1:46] cried.
[1:48] But then one day someone told me of your
[1:54] mercy
[1:56] and the love you showed on a hill called
[2:00] Calary.
[2:03] Oh there you died
[2:07] to purchase my redemption.
[2:12] who broke sin power and set my spirit
[2:16] free.
[2:18] I'm amazed
[2:23] that you love me.
[2:26] Lord, I'm amazed
[2:30] at how you care.
[2:34] Through your preious blood, I found
[2:39] pardoning.
[2:42] And my sins are washed.
[2:46] They've all been washed away.
[2:49] My sins are washed
[2:53] away.
[2:57] Yes, it's true. There's been days when I
[3:01] failed you.
[3:03] [Music]
[3:04] Lord, you know the times I've gone
[3:08] astray.
[3:10] But Lord, I've learned your love is
[3:14] stronger than my weakness.
[3:19] When your ears are open every time I
[3:23] pray,
[3:26] no one else has ever cared for me like
[3:31] you, Lord.
[3:34] No other friend could ever be as close
[3:38] to me.
[3:40] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[3:46] tomorrow.
[3:49] Only you are everything I'll ever need.
[3:55] Oh,
[3:57] [Music]
[4:00] God.
[4:04] I'm amazed
[4:06] at how you care.
[4:10] It's through your preious blood I found
[4:15] pardon.
[4:16] [Music]
[4:18] My sins are washed.
[4:22] They're all washed away.
[4:26] my sins
[4:28] wash
[4:30] away.
[4:33] Yes, it's true. There's been days when I
[4:37] failed you.
[4:40] Lord, you know the times I've gone
[4:44] astray.
[4:47] But Lord, I've learned your love is
[4:50] stronger than my weakness.
[4:55] and your ears are open every time I
[4:59] pray.
[5:01] No one else has ever cared for me like
[5:06] you, Lord.
[5:09] No other friend could ever be as close
[5:14] to me. I'm not afraid to face the
[5:20] problems of tomorrow.
[5:23] [Music]
[5:25] You are everything.
[5:31] I'm amazed
[5:36] that you love me.
[5:39] Lord, I'm amazed
[5:42] that you still care.
[5:46] It's through your precious blood I found
[5:51] pardon.
[5:54] And my sins are washed.
[5:58] They're all washed away.
[6:01] My sins are wash
[6:05] away.
[6:08] Oh, I'm amazed
[6:12] that you love me.
[6:16] I'm amazed
[6:19] at how you care.
[6:23] And through your preious blood I found.
[6:30] And my sins are washed
[6:35] and washed away.
[6:38] My sins are washed
[6:42] away.
[6:45] Yes. My sins are washed.
[6:50] washed away.
[6:53] My sins are washed
[6:56] away.
[7:06] [Music]
[7:11] I cried out for mercy back then.
[7:16] I pled the blood of Jesus.
[7:19] I begged him to my s
[7:24] [Music]
[7:32] wept again.
[7:39] [Music]
[7:47] What city?
[7:49] It's as far away as the east is from the
[7:54] west.
[7:56] My child,
[7:59] what sin?
[8:02] Tell me what sin.
[8:05] It was gone the very minute you
[8:09] confessed
[8:15] in the sea.
[8:18] of forgetfulness.
[8:20] [Music]
[8:23] The heaviest load you'll carry is a load
[8:28] of guilt and shame.
[8:31] You were never meant to bear it. So give
[8:34] it up in my Jesus name.
[8:39] Our God is slow to anger. He is quick to
[8:44] forgive our sins.
[8:46] and put it under the blood. Don't bring
[8:50] it up again.
[8:54] Cuz he'll say,
[8:57] "What sin?
[9:01] What sin?"
[9:03] As far away as the east is from the
[9:07] west.
[9:09] [Music]
[9:12] What sin?
[9:16] What sin?
[9:18] It was gone the very minute you
[9:22] confessed.
[9:24] [Music]
[9:27] It's buried in the sea
[9:31] of forgetfulness.
[9:35] Amen. Are you glad your sins are buried
[9:37] in the sea of forgetfulness?
[9:40] Amen.
[9:43] Let's start off by opening the service
[9:46] up with a word of prayer. We have some
[9:48] some prayer requests here. It says,
[9:51] "Please continue to remember the
[9:53] Fairweather family in prayer as Rob is
[9:56] in his last and final stages of life."
[10:01] Then we got from Sister Carol, prayer
[10:03] for my South Dakota family. Lost a young
[10:07] cousin to suicide. also for nephew JJ
[10:11] who had a liver transplant. He now needs
[10:15] a kidney.

[10:28] and brother Miguel. Do you mind?

[11:22] you, Father, and just give you glory and
[11:25] honor, Lord, because you're worthy.
[11:28] Father, I would just ask that you would

[11:31] Lord. The different ones that aren't
[11:33] feeling well and the ones that are in
[11:36] South Dakota that need you, Father.

[11:51] building that are lifted up. Father,
[11:53] they need you. not only us in this
[11:56] building, but Lord, this world needs
[11:58] you, Lord. And and I would ask, God,
[12:01] that your presence would be welcome. Be
[12:03] welcome in the hearts of those that need
[12:04] you. I would just pray that you would
[12:06] strengthen them, Father. That you would
[12:08] just be with them and their needs, God,
[12:11] and just answer the requests of the
[12:13] hearts, Lord. And we just be careful to
[12:15] give you the glory and honor. We're
[12:17] thankful for you, thankful for the

[12:49] night, his light will shine. God is

[15:36] and greet one another.
[15:39] I am thinking of a rapture in our
[15:43] blessed home on high when the redeemed
[15:48] are gathering in.
[15:52] How we'll raise the heavenly anthem in
[15:55] that city in the sky. When the redeemed
[16:01] are gathering in.

[16:16] How we'll shout
[16:19] and how we'll sing
[16:22] when the redeemed
[16:25] are gathering in.
[16:29] There will be a great procession over on
[16:33] the streets of gold when the redeemed
[16:37] are gathering in.
[16:41] Oh, what music? Oh, what singing? Oh,
[16:44] the city will be rolled. When the
[16:47] redeemed
[16:50] are gathering in.
[16:53] Oh, when the redeems
[16:56] are gathering in,
[16:59] washed like snow
[17:01] and free from all sin.
[17:05] How we'll shout
[17:08] and how we'll sing
[17:11] when the redeemed
[17:13] are gathering in.
[17:17] Saints will sing redemption story with
[17:20] their voices clear and strong. When the
[17:23] redeemed
[17:25] are gathering in,
[17:29] then the angels all will listen. For
[17:32] they cannot join that song. When the
[17:35] redeemed
[17:37] are gathering in.
[17:40] Oh, when the redeemed
[17:43] are gathering in,
[17:45] [Music]

[17:49] and free from all sin.
[17:52] How we'll shout
[17:55] and how we'll see him when the redeemed
[18:01] are gathering in.
[18:04] Then the savior will give orders to
[18:08] prepare the rain and prepar when the
[18:11] redeemed
[18:13] are gathering in.
[18:16] And we'll hear the great

[18:40] How we'll shout.
[18:43] I will sing.
[18:46] When the redeemed
[18:48] are gathering in.
[18:52] When the redeemed
[18:54] are gathering in.
[18:58] Washed like snow
[19:00] and free from all sin.
[19:04] How we'll shout
[19:06] and how we'll sing.

[24:53] Glory to God.
[25:12] [Music]
[25:21] [Music]
[25:40] When the solid ground is falling down
[25:44] from underneath my feet,
[25:48] between the black skies and my red eyes,
[25:52] I can barely see.
[25:56] And when I feel like I've been let down
[26:00] by my friends and my family,
[26:05] I can hear the rain reminding me.
[26:11] In the eye of the storm,
[26:15] you remain in control.
[26:19] In the middle of the war,
[26:22] you guard my soul.
[26:26] You alone are the anchor
[26:30] when my sails are torn.
[26:34] Your love surrounds me
[26:38] in the eye of the storm.
[26:41] [Music]
[26:43] When my hopes and dreams are far from me
[26:47] and I'm running out of faith,
[26:51] I see the future. I pictured
[26:55] slowly fade away.
[26:58] And when the tears of pain and heartache
[27:03] are pouring down my face,
[27:08] I find my peace in Jesus name.
[27:14] In the eye of the storm,
[27:17] you remain in control.
[27:21] In the middle of the war,
[27:25] you guard my soul.
[27:29] You alone are the anchor.
[27:33] When my sails are torn,
[27:37] your love surrounds me
[27:41] in the eye of the storm.
[27:44] [Music]
[27:46] when they let me go. And I just don't
[27:49] know how I'm going to make ends meet. I
[27:53] did my best and now I'm scared to death
[27:57] that we might lose everything.
[28:01] And when a sickness takes my child away
[28:05] and there's nothing I can do,
[28:10] &gt;&gt; my only hope is to trust you.
[28:14] [Applause]
[28:16] &gt;&gt; I trust you, Lord.
[28:20] In the eye of the storm,
[28:23] you remain in control.
[28:27] In the middle of the war,
[28:31] you guard my soul.
[28:34] You alone are the anchor.
[28:39] When my sails are torn,
[28:43] your love surrounds me
[28:46] in the eye of the storm.
[28:50] You alone are the anchor
[28:54] and my sails are torn.

[33:31] he's a way maker.
[33:35] If you need freedom or saving, he's a
[33:40] prison shaking savior. If you got
[33:43] chains,
[33:45] he's a chain breaker.
[33:49] We've all searched for the light of day
[33:52] in the dead of night.
[33:56] We've all found ourselves worn out from
[33:59] the same old fights.
[34:03] We've all run the things we know just
[34:07] ain't right.
[34:09] There's a better life.
[34:13] There's a better life.
[34:17] If you got pain,
[34:20] he's a pain taker.
[34:23] If you feel lost,
[34:27] he's a way maker.
[34:29] [Music]
[34:30] If you need freedom or saving, he's a
[34:35] prison shaking savior. If you got
[34:38] chains,
[34:40] he's a chain breaker.
[34:46] If you believe it,
[34:49] if you receive it,
[34:52] if you can feel it, somebody testify.
[34:59] If you believe it,
[35:03] if you receive it,
[35:06] if you can feel it, somebody testify.
[35:10] Testify.
[35:13] If you believe it,
[35:16] if you receive it,
[35:20] if you can't feel it, somebody testify
[35:25] you got pain.
[35:28] He's a pain taker. Let's sing that as
[35:32] dad prepares his special.
[35:35] He's a way maker.
[35:38] You need freom or saving
[35:43] shaking your got chains.
[35:48] He's a chain breaker. Sing that again as
[35:51] dad gets ready.
[35:55] He's a pain taker.
[35:58] If you feel lost,
[36:02] he's a way maker.
[36:05] If you need freedom or saving, he's a
[36:10] prison shaking savior. If you got
[36:12] chains,
[36:15] he's a chain breakaker.
[36:18] [Music]
[36:21] [Applause]
[36:25] Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; So glad he's a chain breaker.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:33] Amen.

[36:38] race?
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not giving up.

[37:01] crown.

[37:09] to those nail scarred hands.
[37:14] I'm not giving up. know I'll keep
[37:19] holding on.
[37:23] Oh yes, I've been walking through this
[37:26] valley,
[37:29] through this veil of tears.
[37:33] Sometimes I've even questioned if my
[37:38] Lord was even near me.
[37:41] Then at times
[37:44] that old tempter,
[37:46] he says, "Why not turn around?
[37:51] Cuz you can't go any further
[37:55] and you're only losing ground." But I'm
[38:00] not here.
[38:04] I'm not turning round.
[38:06] [Music]
[38:08] By the grace of God, I wear a shining
[38:13] crown. Someday
[38:16] going to keep holding on
[38:21] to those nail scarred hands.
[38:26] I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep
[38:30] holding.
[38:32] Oh, listen to this verse. Oh, would you
[38:36] mind tell me?
[38:39] There's something bothering me.
[38:44] Why is it that old devil, he won't just
[38:48] let God's people be? Oh, he's bound and
[38:54] determined
[38:57] to get right in the way
[39:01] to turn our ways from the way of life
[39:05] and lead our souls astray. But I'm not
[39:10] giving up.
[39:13] I'm not turning round.
[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] By the grace of God, I wear the shining
[39:23] crown. Someday I'm going to keep
[39:27] pulling. Hallelujah.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; To those nail scarred hands.
[39:35] I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep holding
[39:40] on.
[39:43] Oh, now Satan, won't you hear me?
[39:49] Won't you hear me? Well,
[39:53] my God has never failed me and he will
[39:58] not fail me now.
[40:00] Oh, he's been my captain of battles
[40:05] and he's with me even now.
[40:09] And when I gain this victory,
[40:13] my soul is homeward bound. And I'm not
[40:18] he
[40:22] I'm not turning round.
[40:26] By the grace of God, I wear the shining
[40:31] crown. Someday I'm going to keep holding
[40:36] on. Hallelujah.
[40:38] to those nail scar tans.

[40:48] on.
[40:51] Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep
[40:55] holding on.
[41:02] Amen. Are you going to keep holding on
[41:03] here tonight?
[41:11] Let's sing this last song as the man of
[41:13] God prepares to come out.
[41:16] Holy Spirit, rain
[41:21] down,
[41:25] rain
[41:28] down.
[41:31] You're my comforter
[41:35] and friend.
[41:39] Now we need your touch
[41:42] again.
[41:45] Holy Spirit, rain
[41:50] down.
[41:53] Rain

[43:19] stand on your word.
[43:22] Holy Spirit
[43:26] rain
[43:29] rain down.
[43:34] Well, I feel like praising praising him.
[43:40] Oh, I feel like praising praising him.
[43:47] Oh, praise him in the morning.
[43:50] Praise him all day long. I feel like
[43:55] praise and praising him.
[43:59] Well, now come on and praise the Lord
[44:02] while you have a chance.
[44:06] Come on, praise the Lord while you have
[44:08] a chance.
[44:10] [Music]
[44:12] Oh, praise him in the morning. Praise
[44:15] him all day long. Oh, I feel like praise
[44:20] and praising him.
[44:23] Well, oh, I feel like loving loving him.
[44:30] I feel like loving loving him.
[44:35] Oh, love him in the morning.
[44:39] Love him all day long. I feel like love
[44:45] in here. I feel like praising. Oh, I
[44:48] feel like praising praising him.
[44:53] I feel like praising praising him.
[44:59] Oh, praise him in the morning. Praise
[45:03] him all day long. Oh, I feel like praise
[45:08] him. Praising him.
[45:13] Is that the way you feel tonight?
[45:16] Hallelujah. How many feels like praising
[45:18] him tonight?
[45:20] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Now, if you
[45:23] have your Bibles, I'd like to turn to
[45:24] Psalms 150 and verse one. Like to say,
[45:28] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[45:30] here tonight and appreciate Brother
[45:32] Caleb taking the uh the song service
[45:35] tonight. Amen. Thought he did a good job
[45:37] and enjoyed all the specials.
[45:40] Amen. Psalms 150 and verse one. I know
[45:45] it's a Wednesday night, so I'm not going
[45:47] to keep you long. You know that. So,
[45:49] we'll get right into it if we can. Um,
[45:52] but it says, "Praise ye the Lord. Praise
[45:55] God in his sanctuary.
[45:58] Praise him in the firmament of his
[45:59] power.
[46:01] Praise him for his mighty acts.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Praise him according to his excellent
[46:06] greatness." Amen. Praise him with the
[46:09] sound of the trumpet and praise him with
[46:11] the the psalm tree and harp. Praise him
[46:14] with the timberal and dance. Praise him
[46:17] with the stringed instruments in the
[46:18] organ. Praise him upon the loud symbols.
[46:21] Amen. Praise him upon the high sounding
[46:24] symbols. I love this next part. Just
[46:26] help me say it. Let everything that hath
[46:29] breath praise ye the Lord. Amen. Can we
[46:34] also turn to Psalms 113
[46:37] and verse one? Then we'll let you all
[46:39] have your your seats tonight.
[46:49] Verse 1-6
[46:52] says, "How long will thou forget me, oh
[46:54] Lord, forever?
[46:56] How long will thou hide thy face from
[46:58] me?
[47:00] How long shalt I take counsel in my
[47:02] soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?
[47:05] How long shall my enemies be exalted
[47:07] over me? Consider and hear me, oh Lord
[47:11] my God. Lighten my eyes, lest I sleep
[47:15] the sleep of death, lest my enemies say,
[47:18] I have prevailed against him, and those
[47:20] that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
[47:24] But I have trusted in thy mercy, and my
[47:27] heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
[47:30] I will sing unto the Lord, because he
[47:32] hath dealt bountifully
[47:35] with me. May the Lord just add his
[47:38] blessing to the reading of the word as
[47:40] you're being seated here tonight. And if
[47:42] I had a a very simple text here tonight,
[47:47] it would be from from sadness to
[47:50] singing. From sadness to singing. And it
[47:53] has been said that songs and and music
[47:56] are are language of the soul. How many
[47:59] can say that? And brother Brandham says
[48:01] here there's there's nothing like music.
[48:04] You know, God heals by music. Did you
[48:06] know that? Uh-huh. God heals by music.
[48:09] He also says here in the same message of
[48:11] look, he says sometime when you feel all
[48:14] down and as we call it, a street
[48:16] expression down in the dump. See, just
[48:18] put on one of those tapes and that music
[48:21] or record and go to playing it. The
[48:23] first thing you know, you're patting
[48:25] your foot or your hand and it's all
[48:27] over. Then you're right up and ready to
[48:30] go. So we see that music has the power
[48:33] to change your environment. It it has
[48:35] the power to change your atmosphere to a
[48:38] a negative state. It can also change
[48:41] your environment or your atmosphere to a
[48:44] a positive state as well. They say music
[48:47] has the ability to to quicken the heart
[48:50] rate. It it it can cause you to relax.
[48:52] They say music can alter your mood. It
[48:55] it can cause you to feel depressed or it
[48:58] can cheer you up. They said music can
[49:00] excite your emotions or it can help you
[49:03] meditate upon the Lord. It it can cause
[49:06] anxiety or it can relieve anxiety. And
[49:09] whether we realize IT OR NOT, MUSIC DOES
[49:12] AFFECT THE BODY.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; It affects the spirit man as well.
[49:16] That's why it's so important to listen
[49:19] to the right kind of music. Ain't that
[49:21] right? And and you you look at the world
[49:23] today, it's it's always in a a state of
[49:25] rage,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; always in a state of of anger. AND WHAT
[49:29] WHY IS THAT? You wonder. It's the music
[49:32] that they listen to. The rap and the the
[49:35] hip-hop and the heavy metal is affecting
[49:38] that spirit man.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; It's causing THAT SPIRIT MAN TO ALWAYS
[49:42] BE IN AN UPROAR. DO you really think if
[49:45] you're fighting a a spirit, let's say,
[49:47] of depression or anxiety, putting on on
[49:49] rock and roll music, IS IT GOING TO CALM
[49:51] THAT SPIRIT DOWN?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; What is it going to do to that spirit IS
[49:55] GOING TO CAUSE IT TO GET EVEN STRONGER
[49:57] IN YOUR LIFE?
[50:00] &gt;&gt; MUSIC IS SO IMPORTANT TO BEING delivered
[50:02] and being set free.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, WE MUST ASK THE RIGHT KIND OF
[50:08] QUESTIONS. HOW HOW DOES IT AFFECT ME
[50:10] EMOTIONALLY? And what about physically?
[50:13] How does it affect me mentally and AND
[50:16] SPIRITUALLY?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT KIND OF music I that you're
[50:19] listening to is not helping you, I
[50:22] wouldn't listen to it anymore. I'm I'm
[50:24] building a foundation here because
[50:26] listening to that TYPE OF MUSIC, IT'S
[50:28] NOT WORTH THE RISK. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
[50:30] YOU LISTEN TO that kind of music, it
[50:33] opens you up to other spirits.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Music carries spirits.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? And why would I
[50:41] WANT TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING THAT THAT IS
[50:43] GOING TO hurt my spiritual health?
[50:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about music. And as a
[50:50] matter of fact, I'm I'm getting
[50:51] somewhere with this, that music was
[50:54] important to the people of Israel. They
[50:56] they sang and they played musical
[50:59] instruments as they marched into battle.
[51:01] That after every war that they won, they
[51:04] sang again.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; We look at Exodus 15:1. says, "Then sang
[51:08] Moses and the children of Israel this
[51:10] song unto the Lord and spake, saying, I
[51:13] will sing unto the Lord, for he hath
[51:15] triumphed gloriously, and the horse and
[51:18] his rider have been thrown into the sea.
[51:20] THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH AND my song."
[51:23] Amen. And he has become my salvation,
[51:26] and he is my God, and I will prepare for
[51:29] him a habitation, my father's God, and I
[51:33] will exalt him. So we SEE THAT MUSIC IS
[51:36] POWERFUL.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. David played music to soothe the
[51:41] heart of King Saul when he was being
[51:43] tormented by an evil spirit. And we see
[51:46] that that evil spirit will leave Saul
[51:48] for a while. Ain't that right?
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Years later, David was needing
[51:54] encouragement. And he was fighting
[51:57] depression and he WAS HE WAS SUFFERING
[52:00] EMOTIONALLY because he was in a state of
[52:02] despair. And we see that in Psalms 13,
[52:05] we heard that this man is crying
[52:08] desperately FOR GOD TO HELP HIM in that
[52:11] situation that he's in. And and he was
[52:13] he was IN A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT FELT LIKE
[52:16] THAT HE COULDN'T make it any longer.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; And there may be people tonight, I DON'T
[52:21] KNOW, I I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES WHERE
[52:23] I GET TO THE END OF MY ROAD AND I FEEL
[52:26] LIKE I CAN'T MAKE IT ANY ANY LONGER. OR
[52:28] MAYBE I'VE BEEN TROUBLED IN MY SPIRIT OR
[52:31] OR MAYBE I'M STRESSED TO THE LIMIT OR
[52:33] WORK IS NOT THERE OR TRYING TO FIND THE
[52:35] NEXT JOB OR MAYBE WE HAVE FAMILY
[52:37] PROBLEMS OR MONEY PROBLEMS. AND IF WE'RE
[52:40] NOT CAREFUL IN THAT STATE AND WE DWELL
[52:43] ON THAT STATE OF MIND, WHAT'S GOING TO
[52:45] HAPPEN? It can lead to depression.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; It can lead TO ANXIETY. AND IF YOU'RE
[52:51] NOT CAREFUL, YOU CAN ALLOW THINGS TO
[52:54] COME INTO THAT STATE OF MIND THAT CAN
[52:56] BRING SPIRITS INTO YOUR HEART.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, what you listen to, WHAT YOU
[53:02] FEED UPON IS WHAT YOU WILL ULTIMATELY
[53:05] BECOME.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; BUT WE SEE THAT DEPRESSION IS IS HAVING
[53:10] A FIELD day today.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S ATTACKING ALL AGES AND AND
[53:14] CULTURES. IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
[53:16] YOU'RE A MAN OR OR A WOMAN, A BOY, OR
[53:18] GIRL. DEPRESSION IS RUNNING RAPID TODAY.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THAT DEPRESSION is a spirit.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; BUT I'VE COME TO TELL YOU TONIGHT THAT
[53:32] YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE DOWN TO THAT
[53:33] SPIRIT.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER DEPRESSION.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER DESPAIR.
[53:40] YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, ON FIRE AND
[53:42] ANXIETY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER
[53:43] THAT."
[53:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; In that time,
[53:51] it may feel like everything's against
[53:53] you. If I can TELL YOU SOMETHING, BEGIN
[53:56] TO WORSHIP the Lord.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU DON'T, whether you see the
[54:04] bills paid, WHETHER YOU'RE BEHIND,
[54:06] WHETHER YOU HAVE HEALING IN THE BODY, OR
[54:08] WHETHER YOU'RE FIGHTING A SICKNESS, YOU
[54:11] BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD. IT'S IN THOSE
[54:14] MOMENTS THAT YOU BEGIN TO SHOW GOD THAT
[54:17] HE'S STILL IN CONTROL. NO MATTER IF YOU
[54:19] FEEL IT OR YOU DON'T, GOD IS STILL IN
[54:22] CONTROL.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And you BEGIN TO SHOW HIM THAT I WILL
[54:26] TRUST YOU NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL
[54:29] THROWS AT ME THAT IN THIS STATE OF MIND
[54:32] THAT I WILL PRAISE THE LORD.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WORSHIP IS POWERFUL.
[54:43] WORSHIP CAN BRING A DELIVERANCE to a
[54:44] home. You say, "BROTHER KOBE, MY
[54:46] MARRIAGE IS IS NOT WORKING OUT." BEGIN
[54:48] TO PRAISE THE LORD FOR HAVING A RESTORED
[54:51] MARRIAGE. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, MY
[54:53] CHILD IS IS WEWARD." BEGIN TO PRAISE THE
[54:55] LORD LIKE HE'S ALREADY RESTORED THAT SON
[54:58] OR DAUGHTER.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR TRUST IN GOD AND
[55:03] SHOWING THAT I WILL TRUST YOU IN the
[55:06] good times and the bad times.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:11] Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; but it's not a a good feeling when you
[55:17] feel like nobody cares
[55:21] &gt;&gt; and you FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN FORGOTTEN
[55:24] or forsaken and it AND IT FEELS LIKE
[55:26] YOUR PRAYERS THAT YOU'VE BEEN CRYING OUT
[55:29] FROM A DESPERATE HEART IS JUST HITTING A
[55:31] GLASS CEILING. How many's ever been
[55:32] there?
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And we see that that's how David felt.
[55:36] He's he's struggling with depression.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh my.
[55:42] One thing I'm so glad that we serve a
[55:44] God that THAT THAT DOESN'T FORGET ABOUT
[55:47] YOU.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; That he knows who you are.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE STATE OF MIND THAT YOU'RE
[55:53] IN. HE HE KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE. HE KNOWS
[55:55] YOUR NAME AND HE KNOWS YOUR SITUATION.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching from experience ON THIS.
[56:00] I'VE BEEN IN THOSE TIMES WHERE I FOUGHT
[56:02] DEPRESSION SO HEAVILY WHERE I FELT LIKE
[56:05] IT WAS GOING TO CONSUME MY LIFE. AND THE
[56:07] ONLY THING THAT I COULD DO WAS CALL OUT
[56:09] TO A GOD THAT CARES.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES WHERE NOBODY ELSE CARES.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S TIMES WHERE YOU FEEL ALONE,
[56:16] BUT GOD HAS NOT FORSAKEN YOU IN THOSE
[56:18] TIMES. HE'S TURNING YOUR SADNESS INTO
[56:22] SINGING HERE TONIGHT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER
[56:24] KOBE, I I FEEL THIS. I NEED A HEALING."
[56:27] WHY DON'T YOU BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD
[56:28] RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE AT TONIGHT AND WATCH
[56:30] GOD COME UP ON THE SCENE.
[56:34] PRAISE. PRAISE WILL BREAK THE CHAINS IN
[56:38] YOUR LIFE.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; As the SONG SAYS, PRAISE IS WHAT BRINGS
[56:42] THE WALLS OF Jericho down.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Praise is the one that delivered the
[56:47] children of Israel THAT BEGIN TO PRAISE
[56:49] THE LORD.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HEARD THEIR CRY AND GOD CAME
[56:53] UPON THE SCENE.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my Yeah. Hallelujah.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; But we see David is talking here in
[57:01] Psalms 13 and1 AND HE SAYS, "HOW LONG
[57:04] WILL THOU FORGET ME, oh Lord? Oh my,
[57:08] forever.
[57:09] HOW LONG WILL THOU HIDE THY FACE FROM
[57:12] ME?" And it is believed that during this
[57:15] time when WHEN DAVID WROTE THIS PSALM
[57:17] THAT he was running from Saul
[57:20] &gt;&gt; AND FROM THE MEN OF SAUL, THEY WERE HUNT
[57:22] DAVID LIKE AN ANIMAL. Oh my.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we begin to SEE THAT DAVID
[57:27] CAME CLOSE TO DEATH MANY TIMES AND HE'S
[57:30] SOMEHOW MANAGED TO ESCAPE. NOW HE'S
[57:32] WEARY AND HE'S DRAINED PHYSICALLY AND
[57:36] MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. HE'S HE'S BEEN
[57:38] RUNNING ON FUMES. OH MY, how many's been
[57:40] there?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; AND DURING THIS TIME OF DESPERATION, HE
[57:44] CRIES OUT FOR HELP. AND HE ASKS, "GOD,
[57:47] WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME? GOD, DO
[57:49] YOU SEE ME IN MY time of need?" Yeah.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I need an answer.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; God, I I I NEED I NEED MY BILLS PAID.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; LORD, I' I I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS THIS
[58:02] THIS MENTAL WARFARE. GOD, I I NEED HELP.
[58:05] GOD HEARS THE CRY OF HIS PEOPLE.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED THAT IF YOU JUST CRY OUT
[58:12] THAT HE WILL DELIVER YOU.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE BEEN TIRED FROM FIGHTING DAY
[58:18] IN AND DAY OUT. WE'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED.
[58:21] WE'VE WE'VE HAD FAILURES. We've suffered
[58:24] losses.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; We have felt isolated. AND WE'VE BEEN WE
[58:29] WONDER, GOD, why would YOU ALLOW US TO
[58:31] GET HERE?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; If I can give a little word of
[58:38] encouragement here tonight. God is here
[58:40] and he wants to pick you up.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; God wants to ENCOURAGE YOU. GOD WANTS to
[58:46] lift a feeble hand. Oh my. IF THERE'S
[58:48] ANYTHING I CAN DO TONIGHT, I JUST WANT
[58:50] TO GIVE YOU A SHOT IN THE ARM AND LET
[58:52] YOU KNOW YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
[58:54] FORSAKEN, BUT GOD HAS NOT forsaken you.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; WE GET IN OUR STATE THAT WE'RE DEALING
[59:00] WITH THAT IT JUST IF THE DEVIL FIGHTS US
[59:03] IN OUR MIND SAYING YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; SAYING THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU AND
[59:09] NO ONE LOVES YOU AND YOU HAVE BEEN
[59:10] FORSAKEN EVEN BY GOD.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; BUT IF WE CAN EVER GET IN A IN A RIGHT
[59:16] FRAME OF MIND, YEAH.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; AND KNOW THAT THE GOD THAT WE PUT OUR
[59:21] TRUST IN, HE'S NOT HE'S NOT FEEBLE LIKE
[59:24] MAN,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER GROWS TIRED AND WEARY.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; OH,
[59:33] &gt;&gt; but he wants to heal you.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; And he's the only one that can.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; The world turns to medication. And the
[59:42] world TURNS TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. THEY
[59:44] turn to affairs and not realizing that
[59:47] the one thing that they need is standing
[59:49] before them.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; THE ONE THING THAT WON'T GIVE HIM A
[59:54] HANGOVER.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; The one thing that WON'T GET HIM
[59:57] ADDICTED TO DRUGS, THE ONE THING THAT
[1:00:00] WON'T LEAVE him with A BROKEN MARRIAGE
[1:00:02] IS STANDING BEFORE HIM.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO HEAL, BUT YOU HAVE TO CRY
[1:00:06] OUT IN DESPERATION.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; YOU have to GET TO A STATE WHERE YOU'RE
[1:00:10] TIRED of living in THAT SAME CONDITION.
[1:00:13] YOU KNOW, I may have been preaching
[1:00:15] this. I preached this before, but I'm
[1:00:17] preaching it AGAIN TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD
[1:00:19] WANTS TO HELP HIS PEOPLE.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; God wants to turn your sadness into
[1:00:28] singing.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; But even with the Holy Ghost, life is
[1:00:40] still life. Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; We're still going to go through
[1:00:43] struggles.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; We're going to go
[1:00:48] through sorrow and loss.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; We will go through disappointments. I
[1:00:53] wish that we lived in a perfect world.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; I wish that we can wake up every day and
[1:00:59] and not be offended by this person or
[1:01:02] fight sicknesses. I wish that we could
[1:01:04] have that. But we're not there yet.
[1:01:07] Until then, my heart will go on singing.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; UNTIL I SEE MY SALVATION
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; AND UNTIL I SEE THE REWARDS, UNTIL I I
[1:01:19] MAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE, MY HEART, NO
[1:01:21] MATTER HOW DEVASTATED I MAY FEEL,
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; I WILL GO MORE REJOICING AND PRAISING
[1:01:28] GOD LIKE I ALREADY HAVE the answer.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I can do all things through
[1:01:40] Christ
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; who gives me strength." And it's through
[1:01:43] those difficult times in life that God
[1:01:46] will give you strength to get through
[1:01:48] it.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; How many's ever prayed and it feels like
[1:01:53] you couldn't find God?
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Am I the only one?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; David felt like he couldn't find God.
[1:02:01] And he felt like in this Psalms 13, he
[1:02:05] he felt like God had forgotten about
[1:02:07] him.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] And his heart begins to cry out, "God,
[1:02:15] how long are you going to forget about
[1:02:17] me?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Well, will it be forever?" But through
[1:02:21] all this, David never gave up on God.
[1:02:25] AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:02:28] however you feel, don't give up on God.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; David didn't understand what was going
[1:02:36] on, but he knew a God that wouldn't
[1:02:40] leave him.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't that right here
[1:02:44] tonight?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Rejoice
[1:02:48] in your tribulation."
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; skip through some of this here so we can
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; go through this quicker. But Psalms 13:2
[1:02:59] says, "How long shall I counsel in my
[1:03:02] soul
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; and have sorrow in my heart and daily?
[1:03:07] How long shall my enemies be exalted
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; over me?" David is telling us something
[1:03:13] here. He's telling us that we we we must
[1:03:17] not counsel in ourselves.
[1:03:22] young people, we do need the counsel of
[1:03:24] elders.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; WE DO NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE THAT has
[1:03:29] been there before.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Isolation, we've talked about it before,
[1:03:33] but isolation will destroy you.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And when you feel like you're all alone,
[1:03:39] it's the time to reach out to someone
[1:03:42] that's been there before.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:51] Yes, sir.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; But when we START FEELING LIKE GOD HAS
[1:03:54] FORSAKEN US AND OR LET US DOWN, REMEMBER
[1:03:57] something that HE IS THE ONE THAT'S
[1:03:59] TOUCHABLE and approachable when we're
[1:04:02] struggling with the feelings of
[1:04:03] infirmity. HEBREWS 4:15 TELLS US THAT HE
[1:04:07] WAS TEMPTED in all areas as a man,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; yet without sin.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; JESUS FELT WHAT YOU GOING are going
[1:04:14] through here tonight.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; JESUS HAS HAS FELT LIKE HE WAS FORSAKEN.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. On the cross in Matthew 27 and 46,
[1:04:28] it says about the ninth hour Jesus cried
[1:04:30] with a loud voice saying, "My God,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And because Jesus suffered and endured,
[1:04:39] NOW HE GIVES US THE STRENGTH in our
[1:04:42] times of trouble. Hebrews 2:18 says,
[1:04:45] "For in that he has suffered being
[1:04:47] tempted, he is able to secure them that
[1:04:50] are tempted." Come on, somebody. 2
[1:04:53] Corinthians 4:8 says, "We are troubled
[1:04:56] ON EVERY SIDE, YET NOT DISTRESSED."
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; WE ARE PERPLEXED, BUT NOT IN DESPAIR.
[1:05:02] PERSECUTED, BUT NOT FORSAKEN.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; PERSECUTED, BUT NOT FORSAKEN. CAST DOWN
[1:05:09] BUT NOT DESTROYED.
[1:05:13] [Applause]
[1:05:14] AMEN.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; SATAN CAN'T DESTROY YOU.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE FEELING LIKE THAT YOU'RE
[1:05:20] YOU'RE AT THE END OF THE ROAD, BUT YOU
[1:05:23] CANNOT BE DESTROYED.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; YOUR BODY MAY BE TELLING YOU IT'S TIME
[1:05:30] TO GIVE IN.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; YOUR MIND MAY BE TELLING YOU IT'S TIME
[1:05:34] TO GIVE UP.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; BUT IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT, THERE IS A
[1:05:38] STRENGTH.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT be destroyed. That's right.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Paul is telling us THAT THAT THINGS ARE
[1:05:47] NOT AS BAD as they seem to be. We see
[1:05:49] the three HEBREW BOYS SUFFERED THE FIERY
[1:05:51] FURNACE, BUT THEY WERE NOT DESTROYED.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; DANIEL SUFFERED THE LION'S DEN, BUT HE
[1:05:56] WAS NOT DESTROYED.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Peter suffered threats and in the jail
[1:06:01] cell, but he wasn't destroyed.
[1:06:04] HALLELUJAH. HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HERE
[1:06:06] TONIGHT.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; IT MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS IT LOOKS. YOU
[1:06:10] MAY BE SUFFERING, BUT YOU CANNOT be
[1:06:12] destroyed here tonight. WHAT WAS MEANT
[1:06:15] FOR EVIL, GOD HAS TURNED IT FOR YOUR
[1:06:17] good here tonight. If God before you, if
[1:06:21] God before you, who can be against you
[1:06:24] here tonight,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; my goodness,
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; we see that David was going through a
[1:06:33] difficult time in his life. So, he began
[1:06:36] to sing. Psalms 13:5 says, "But I
[1:06:39] trusted in thy mercy and my heart will
[1:06:42] rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing
[1:06:46] unto the Lord because he has dealt
[1:06:48] bountifully with me IN SPITE OF TRIALS
[1:06:52] AND AND BURDENS AND disappointments in
[1:06:54] life. You have a song that's on your
[1:06:56] heart." And I'm talking about a song
[1:06:59] that's that's unexplainable.
[1:07:02] How is Brother Marorrow and SISTER LEE
[1:07:03] AND MY WIFE AND SISTER AMY ABLE TO GO
[1:07:06] THROUGH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; AND STILL THROUGH IT ALL COUNT GOD
[1:07:10] FAITHFUL?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; How is it that grandpa has been
[1:07:13] struggling with Parkinson's for year
[1:07:15] after year?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And still HE HAS COUNTED GOD FAITHFUL.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; HOW IS IT THAT GRANDMA HAS BEEN TAKING
[1:07:23] CARE OF GRANDPA THROUGH SICKNESS and in
[1:07:25] health
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; and THROUGH IT ALL HAS COUNTED GOD
[1:07:29] FAITHFUL?
[1:07:31] WE CAN GO THROUGH EVERY PERSON HERE THAT
[1:07:33] HAS HAD THE HARDSHIPS OF LIFE. We can't
[1:07:36] EXPLAIN WHY WE STILL HAVE A SONG ON our
[1:07:39] heart. All we know is IN THE GOOD TIMES
[1:07:42] WE GIVE GOD THE PRAISE ANYWAY.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; If we left it UP TO OUR BODIES AND WE WE
[1:07:50] WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT OUR SALVATION IS
[1:07:57] NOT BASED UPON HOW WE FEEL.
[1:08:00] NOT BASED UPON HOW OUR JOB IS AND HOW
[1:08:02] MUCH MONEY WE GOT IN THE ACCOUNT, BUT
[1:08:05] IT'S BASED UPON A ROCK SOLID FOUNDATION
[1:08:08] THAT THE WINDS OF HELL CANNOT DESTROY.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW WE CAN SING A SONG IN THE
[1:08:15] DARKNESS OF NIGHT. THAT'S HOW WE CAN
[1:08:18] WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF
[1:08:20] DEATH AND SAY IN MY HEART, I WILL FEAR
[1:08:22] NO EVIL
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S with me.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SUBJECT UPON YOUR emotional
[1:08:33] state.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you're going to
[1:08:41] always have a song on your heart.
[1:08:42] Brother Josh,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; there's going to be times when you wake
[1:08:45] up when you don't want to sing,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; but you sing anyway.
[1:08:57] There's going to be times
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I've been there where you don't want to
[1:09:01] go to church
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; and you would rather I've been there
[1:09:06] rather stay home and sleep
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; but you go TO CHURCH ANYWAY. I FOUND OUT
[1:09:13] those services where I've had to push
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; and I've had to press
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; and had to COME IN AND AND FORCE MYSELF
[1:09:19] TO RAISE MY HANDS AND FORCE MYSELF to
[1:09:22] sing and force myself to enter in. Was
[1:09:24] the times where I got my breakthrough.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; God will reward a person that is going
[1:09:31] to come IN REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION.
[1:09:33] AMEN.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Your praise will display itself in in
[1:09:41] the most unusual times under the
[1:09:44] harshest of conditions.
[1:09:47] There is something IN YOUR HEART THAT'S
[1:09:48] READY TO BUBBLE out and give God praise.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; We see that Paul and Silas was in jail
[1:09:55] at the midnight hour. What do they begin
[1:09:58] to do? They begin to complain about
[1:10:00] their circumstances.
[1:10:03] Do they say, "You know what? I I really
[1:10:05] thought God was was, you know, better
[1:10:10] than this and now I'm just I don't since
[1:10:12] he's not helping me."
[1:10:14] What did they begin to do?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; They begin to praise the Lord.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that God sent an
[1:10:22] earthquake that shook the place
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; and immediately the doors were open and
[1:10:28] everyone's bands were loosed.
[1:10:31] When your FAITH IS IN GOD, YOU can sing
[1:10:33] a song of praise.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; And people around you may not get it.
[1:10:37] They're they may have seen what you've
[1:10:38] went through.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; They may have seen you get chewed out BY
[1:10:41] YOUR BOSS. OR THEY MAY HAVE SEEN YOU
[1:10:42] JUST GET FIRED. OR OR they may HAVE JUST
[1:10:44] SEEN YOUR CAR IS HAVING PROBLEMS AGAIN.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Your car is DEAD AGAIN.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY,
[1:10:52] BUT YOU'RE PRAISING THE LORD. WHAT IS
[1:10:54] CAUSING THIS?
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; THE world doesn't understand it.
[1:11:01] Oh my. Trust in the Lord.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Trust
[1:11:07] is the deepest.
[1:11:13] I hope this is okay tonight.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; In order to fully believe in God and
[1:11:18] have faith in God, we must trust
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; that he has everything under control.
[1:11:27] Sometimes it's it's hard to do that
[1:11:30] because we want to do it ourselves,
[1:11:32] right?
[1:11:34] We we we we sometimes it's hard for man
[1:11:36] to let go of the reigns.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; We like to be in control. We we we want
[1:11:42] to do it our way and figure things out
[1:11:44] OUR WAY. BUT GOD WANTS YOU to trust in
[1:11:48] him.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm almost done. And I pray this
[1:11:54] is okay here tonight.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; But we see here that
[1:12:02] David was crying out to God in his in
[1:12:05] his circumstance. And
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; he's saying here, Lord, Psalms 51:11
[1:12:11] says, "Cast me not away
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; from thy presence, oh my, that's my
[1:12:17] prayer.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; And take not thy holy spirit from me
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; and restore Restore unto me the joy of
[1:12:25] my salvation
[1:12:28] and uphold me with thy free spirit.
[1:12:32] The song of David's heart
[1:12:35] was a heart of praise and rejoicing.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; We see that this verse came right after
[1:12:41] David
[1:12:44] committed adultery with Basheba.
[1:12:47] And we begin to see how how God was
[1:12:49] dealing with David. And David comes out
[1:12:52] and says, "Cast me not away."
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; God's mercy is always there.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And even in this state of mind, he still
[1:13:05] had a heart of praise.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; You're always going to have something
[1:13:14] within you.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; What has kept you? Honestly, I know I
[1:13:20] keep referring back to brother Merlin
[1:13:21] and sister Leah, but what has kept you
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; through this time?
[1:13:28] Seeing my wife and how she goes through
[1:13:30] it and there's times where she'll cry
[1:13:31] and what has kept you through this time.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; It wasn't your ability.
[1:13:44] If it was left up to man, I would
[1:13:46] imagine they would have already ran off.
[1:13:50] But it was God that has kept him.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; I don't understand how brother Merl
[1:13:59] could sometimes get up here.
[1:14:03] I wish I had his energy,
[1:14:07] but it's
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; he's singing from a heart that puts his
[1:14:11] trust in God. That's right.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; We don't understand
[1:14:16] why we go through things in life,
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; but we know who holds tomorrow.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; We know that that we we don't know
[1:14:26] WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE TOMORROW, but
[1:14:27] we got a God
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; that keeps YOU IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; OH, I wish I could portray it like I see
[1:14:35] it tonight.
[1:14:37] Oh my.
[1:14:40] He gives us a a song of praise.
[1:14:44] And
[1:14:46] whether you can sing or or can't sing,
[1:14:50] sometimes you got to just get it out.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm almost done here tonight.
[1:14:59] Skip through some of this here. Psalms
[1:15:02] 96:E1 says, "Oh, sing unto the Lord a
[1:15:05] new song and and sing unto the Lord all
[1:15:08] the earth.
[1:15:09] Sing unto the Lord and bless his name.
[1:15:12] Show forth his salvation from day to
[1:15:15] day. I I've come to tell you it's time
[1:15:17] that we stop belly aching and sing.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME THAT WE STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT
[1:15:23] WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH and begin to
[1:15:25] rejoice in the Lord. IT'S IT'S TIME THAT
[1:15:27] WE STOP GRIPING AND BEGIN TO SING. IT'S
[1:15:30] TIME THAT WE START START singing to the
[1:15:33] Lord
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; because he's given us a song. Psalms
[1:15:36] 98:1 says, "Oh, sing unto the Lord a new
[1:15:40] song.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; For he hath done marvelous things." How
[1:15:43] many can say that tonight?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; His right hand and his holy arm has
[1:15:47] gotten him the victory.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord has made known his salvation.
[1:15:52] His righteousness has he openly showed
[1:15:55] in the sight of the heathen. Revelations
[1:15:58] 14:3 says, "And they sang as it were a
[1:16:01] new song before the throne
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; and before the four beasts and the
[1:16:05] elders, and no man can learn that song,
[1:16:08] but the 140 and 4,000 which were
[1:16:12] redeemed FROM THE EARTH." NOBODY CAN
[1:16:14] SING YOUR SONG here tonight.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; As the song says, YOU DON'T KNOW LIKE I
[1:16:21] KNOW
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S BROUGHT ME
[1:16:26] FROM. WHAT HE'S DELIVERED ME FROM. YOU
[1:16:29] DON'T KNOW.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I come to church
[1:16:33] WHETHER I FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT AND SING
[1:16:35] BECAUSE HE HAS DONE SOMETHING FOR ME.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; OH MY. NOBODY CAN SNUFF IT OUT. YOU HAVE
[1:16:43] SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL for here
[1:16:44] tonight. Revelations 5:9 says, "And they
[1:16:47] sang A NEW SONG. THOU ARE worthy to take
[1:16:51] the book and to open the seals thereof.
[1:16:54] For thou was slain and hast redeemed us
[1:16:56] to God by thy blood out of every kindred
[1:17:00] and tongue and people and nation here
[1:17:03] tonight. If I can say it, it's time to
[1:17:06] rejoice.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; REJOICE IN the Lord always. And again, I
[1:17:11] say rejoice.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David realized that he had a
[1:17:17] lot to be thankful for. And I came
[1:17:19] across this quote today and I I thought
[1:17:21] it was pretty good. I'm cutting in here.
[1:17:23] But brother Brandham says, "He's my
[1:17:24] friend when I am broke.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; He's my friend when I got plenty. Oh my.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I love him when I'm hungry.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And I love him when I'm filled. I love
[1:17:37] him when I'm in sorrow.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; I love him when I am happy. I love him
[1:17:42] because he first loved me. HE SAYS WHEN
[1:17:45] I AM SICK AND DYING, he's my friend.
[1:17:48] WHEN I AM FEELING GOOD TONIGHT AND
[1:17:49] HAPPY, HE'S STILL MY FRIEND. WHEN I'M
[1:17:52] LAYING YONDER DYING SOMEWHERE AND MY
[1:17:54] CHILLY veins are COMING UP MY ARM LIKE
[1:17:56] THAT, he will be my friend. And when
[1:17:59] these brittle THREADS THAT I'M WALKING
[1:18:01] ON breaks and plunges them into
[1:18:03] eternity, he'll be my friend then, too.
[1:18:06] WHEN THE AGES ROLLED ON ABOUT 10,000
[1:18:09] YEARS AND YOU SUNG YOUR JUBILEE SONG,
[1:18:12] HE'LL still be your friend then. He
[1:18:13] says, "Yes, sir. When there's no moon
[1:18:16] and no more sun and no more earth, he'll
[1:18:19] still be your friend." Hallelujah. And
[1:18:22] I'm here TO TELL YOU TONIGHT, HE'S YOUR
[1:18:24] FRIEND.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU FEEL IT OR NOT, HE'S YOUR
[1:18:28] FRIEND HERE TONIGHT.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I love it. When I'm broke,
[1:18:35] I'm so glad he's still my friend.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him here tonight.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the musicians come here
[1:18:45] tonight, Psalms 107 and8 says, "Oh, that
[1:18:48] men would praise the Lord for his
[1:18:51] goodness
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; and for his wonderful works to the
[1:18:55] children
[1:18:57] of men." Do you love him here tonight?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Can you hit G?
[1:19:03] Oh, praise him. Oh, praise
[1:19:08] him.
[1:19:10] Praise him in the morning.
[1:19:13] Praise him in the noon.
[1:19:16] Praise
[1:19:18] him. Oh, praise
[1:19:21] him. Oh, praise him. When the sun goes
[1:19:26] down,

[1:19:30] him. Oh, serve
[1:19:34] him.
[1:19:35] Serve him in the morning. Serve him in
[1:19:39] the moon.
[1:19:41] Serve him. Oh, serve
[1:19:46] him.
[1:19:47] Serve him when the sun goes down.
[1:19:52] Oh, I've got a right
[1:19:55] to praise the Lord.
[1:19:58] I've got a right
[1:20:01] to lift my voice.
[1:20:04] Oh, ain't nobody got to ride like the
[1:20:07] children of the Lord and see the light.
[1:20:10] I've been redeemed by the blood of the
[1:20:12] lamb. I've got a ride
[1:20:15] for you.
[1:20:19] When he saved my soul,
[1:20:22] you ought to have been there.
[1:20:25] When he put my name on the road,
[1:20:29] I start walking. I start talking. I
[1:20:32] start singing. And I start shouting
[1:20:35] about what the Lord has done for me. You

[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. They used to always have those
[1:24:36] Amen. The Old Testament would bring
[1:24:38] those not those singers out. They would
[1:24:41] come and sing before the Lord. So many
[1:24:45] times the Lord would say, "You don't
[1:24:47] have to fight this battle. Just leave
[1:24:48] your swords at home." Amen. Just come
[1:24:51] out with a praise. Come out with singing

[1:31:50] And uh

[1:32:09] Friday, Saturday, and and um and there's
[1:32:12] a big chance for Sunday. So, uh, let's
[1:32:16] just let's just pray that that the Lord
[1:32:18] would would, um, would help us there.
[1:32:20] How many believes how many believes the
[1:32:22] Lord can just move the rain?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; You know, we had rain. Uh, I remember
[1:32:28] when we were,
[1:32:30] Brother Wayne had flew down and his dad
[1:32:32] had come there. Everyone, we had the
[1:32:34] equipment here to do the to do our yard.
[1:32:38] And, uh, they get out here and it's just
[1:32:41] dropping those big old rain. It is dark.
[1:32:44] Amen. And and uh you know they were
[1:32:48] asking, "Well, well, which way you want
[1:32:49] to go, Brother Windle?" I said, "You
[1:32:51] guys are here and we're putting in a
[1:32:52] parking lot." And uh I said, "Let's just
[1:32:56] let's just go at it." And so we we were
[1:32:58] we were going and and uh uh I I remember
[1:33:02] us over o over across the street over
[1:33:04] there uh eating and uh the ladies had
[1:33:08] brought some food out and and and it was
[1:33:11] oh it was dark. Y'all y'all remember
[1:33:13] that how dark it was and there was that
[1:33:15] it was and it was sprinkling and we were
[1:33:18] praying and and u did you know that that
[1:33:23] that right as we got through taking our
[1:33:25] break there was a little just a little
[1:33:28] part in the sky out here that opened up
[1:33:32] just a little part and did you know that
[1:33:35] that it didn't leave it didn't leave
[1:33:37] Oklahoma it went around our area the
[1:33:40] little town of Ponyie just skirted
[1:33:42] around us. And uh sister sister Leah was
[1:33:47] was looking at it on the phone and she
[1:33:48] says, "Look at this." And it was showing
[1:33:51] that it was going around and uh
[1:33:56] it it went all of these towns all around
[1:33:58] us. And they say that it dumped over 2
[1:34:01] in on them. And all of these little
[1:34:04] towns, we're talking about Morrison, uh,
[1:34:06] uh, Skiy, all of these towns around
[1:34:10] around Pawnie, they got dumped on. They
[1:34:13] got our portion. Hallelujah. And we did
[1:34:15] not get any rain.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:34:24] And then there was another story of the
[1:34:26] flip side and I don't know if we should
[1:34:28] tell that story or not because it has to
[1:34:31] do with
[1:34:33] rain coming instead of rain going away.
[1:34:35] But brother Merl and Sister Leah, they
[1:34:37] they were out there. What the fires were
[1:34:41] right up next to them and the these
[1:34:42] fires were going and going. Uh they were
[1:34:45] they had they had licked up acres,

[1:38:20] and that God would would be with us. We
[1:38:24] um
[1:38:25] uh always praying for every one of you
[1:38:29] and uh we appreciate every one of you. I
[1:38:32] lit thinking there when brother Josh was
[1:38:36] uh or brother Kobe talking about Merurl
[1:38:38] and losing Adam and and um actually u
[1:38:42] brother John Sister April they just they
[1:38:44] just got back uh from visiting New
[1:38:47] Mexico and the grave of their of their
[1:38:50] baby that that didn't didn't make it.
[1:38:54] And um you know these these kinds of
[1:38:58] things tear homes apart. They they they
[1:39:02] tear faith. But there's something that's
[1:39:05] anchored in in our souls that are are
[1:39:07] very real. And and we know that Adam is
[1:39:10] not dead. Adam is waiting. And neither
[1:39:13] is your baby. He's not in that grave.
[1:39:16] He's waiting on you to come. And that
[1:39:20] there's just so many things we we see
[1:39:22] things so differently than what others
[1:39:24] see them. But I'm so glad for that
[1:39:27] grace. That song, something keeps
[1:39:29] holding me. There's something that keeps
[1:39:32] holding me. Amen. You've got a you've
[1:39:35] got a daughter waiting on you on the
[1:39:38] other side as well, brother and sister
[1:39:40] Curtis. And you know, you're not
[1:39:43] supposed to bury your young. You're
[1:39:45] supposed to bury the old, not the young.
[1:39:49] But
[1:39:50] but no matter what Satan throws at us,
[1:39:53] we don't judge God unfaithful. We judge
[1:39:56] God true. Can you say amen?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; And one thing we do, we love each other
[1:40:02] while we've got each other. Hug those
[1:40:05] babies. Love those babies with all of
[1:40:08] you. Don't go a day without telling your
[1:40:11] your children how much they mean to you,
[1:40:15] how special they are. And pray for them.
