[26:38] lives. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh we're
[26:43] we're going to look here um Daniel 3 and
[26:46] 1.
[26:49] It says Nebuchadnezzar the king made an
[26:51] image of gold whose height was three
[26:54] score cubits and the breadth thereof six
[26:57] cubits and he set it up in the plain of
[27:00] Dura in the province of Babylon. Then
[27:03] Nebuchadnezzar the king sent together
[27:06] the princes, the governors and the
[27:07] captains, the judges, the treasurers,
[27:10] the counselors, the sheriffs, and all
[27:13] the rulers of the provinces to come to
[27:16] the dedication
[27:17] of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the
[27:20] king had set up. Then the princes, the
[27:23] governors, the captains, the judges, the
[27:25] treasurers, the counselors, the
[27:28] sheriffs, and all of the rulers of the
[27:30] provinces were gathered together unto
[27:32] the dedication of the image that
[27:34] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. They
[27:37] stood before the image that
[27:39] Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then in
[27:42] Herald cried out,
[27:44] to you it is commanded, oh people,
[27:47] nations, and languages,
[27:50] that at one time ye hear the sound of
[27:54] the cornet, the flute, harp, uh the
[27:58] sacbut, the sultry, doulamer, and all
[28:02] kinds of music, ye fall down, and
[28:04] worship the golden image that
[28:06] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And
[28:09] whosoever fallth not doubt and worship
[28:12] uh worshipeth the same hour will be cast
[28:15] in the midst of the burning fiery
[28:17] furnace. Therefore at that time when all
[28:20] the people heard the sound of the cornet
[28:22] flute harp sack but sultry and all kinds
[28:27] of music all the people the nations and
[28:30] the languages fell down and worshiped
[28:32] the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[28:35] king had set up. Wherefore at that time
[28:40] certain Chaldans came near and accused
[28:42] the Jews. They spake saying and said to
[28:46] King Nea Nebuchadnezzar, "Oh king, live
[28:49] forever. Thou, oh king, hast made a
[28:52] decree that every man that shall hear
[28:55] the sound of the cornet, flute, heart,
[28:57] sac, sultry, doulamer, and all kinds of
[29:01] music shall fall down and worship the
[29:03] golden image. And who so fleth not down
[29:06] and worshipeth that he should be cast
[29:08] into the midst of the burning fiery
[29:10] furnace. There are certain Jews here who
[29:15] um whom thou hast set over the affairs
[29:18] of the province of Babylon. Shadrach,
[29:21] Meach, and Abednego.
[29:23] These men, O king, have not regarded
[29:25] thee. They serve not thy gods, nor
[29:29] worship the golden image which thou hast
[29:33] set up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage
[29:36] and fury commanded to bring Shadrach,
[29:38] Meshach, and Abednego.
[29:41] And they brought these men before the
[29:42] king. And Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[29:45] unto them, "Is it true, oh Shadrach,
[29:47] Meshach, and Abednego?
[29:50] Do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the
[29:52] golden image which I have set up? Now if
[29:55] you be ready that at what time ye hear
[29:59] um all of the music and fall down and
[30:02] worship the image which I have made.
[30:05] Wow. But if you worship not, ye shall be
[30:08] cast the same hour in the midst of the
[30:12] burning fiery furnace. Who is that God
[30:16] that shall deliver you out of my hands?
[30:20] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered
[30:22] and said to the king, "Oh
[30:24] Nebuchadnezzar,
[30:26] we are not careful to answer thee in
[30:28] this matter, if it be so that our God uh
[30:32] our God whom we serve is able to deliver
[30:34] us from the burning fiery furnace, and
[30:38] he will deliver us out of thine hand, O
[30:41] king. But if not, be it known unto thee,
[30:44] oh king, that we will not serve thy
[30:46] gods, nor worship the golden image which
[30:50] thou hast set up. Let's go to the Lord
[30:53] in prayer.
[30:55] Father, we just want to thank you today
[30:58] for your goodness, for your blessings.
[31:01] Thank you, Lord, for always being
[31:03] faithful to us. For Lord, when things
[31:06] around us get a little shaky or we're in
[31:09] the trial or Lord, the circumstances
[31:12] around us may be uncertain, you have
[31:16] always been good to us, Lord. And
[31:19] Father, we ask here today that your Holy
[31:21] Spirit, Lord, would would accept our
[31:25] love and our praise as we have given it
[31:27] to you. And Lord, we ask that you would
[31:30] speak to our hearts. And Lord, that you
[31:33] would establish our hearts in you.
[31:36] Father, we love you with all of our
[31:38] heart in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:41] Christ. Can the church say amen?
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[31:47] seated here tonight.
[31:50] Amen. We
[31:53] have for a title, we rejoice in the day
[31:56] of small things.
[31:59] And of course that is coming from a
[32:03] scripture. Amen. There in
[32:07] that was being spoke of a man. Um
[32:12] talking of to Zerubabel who hath
[32:15] despised the day of small things.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; And um u and so we we don't want to
[32:23] despise the day of small things.
[32:27] We don't want to as Shadrach, Meshach,
[32:30] and Abednego had had uh uh were
[32:36] definitely the minority in this
[32:37] situation. They were they
[32:41] of all the nations of the earth. Now,
[32:44] Babylon was the greatest nation of all
[32:46] the earth. And and all of the nations
[32:48] were required to come in for this. This
[32:50] was a this was not just a little
[32:52] backyard
[32:54] um potluck. this this here was a uh this
[32:57] was a major thing
[33:00] &gt;&gt; and um
[33:02] but yet the three young men there they
[33:06] stood their purpose they stood their
[33:09] convictions
[33:11] and we find that this day though they
[33:15] were totally outnumbered and though they
[33:17] were totally in the minority
[33:22] this particular day Amen. man is a day
[33:25] that is forever engraved in history
[33:29] &gt;&gt; because this is the day where three men
[33:33] brought the son of God down to earth and
[33:37] and he visibly manifested his glory in a
[33:42] pagan nation. Amen. And brought the king
[33:45] to his knees.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; It it was it was a time where it it it
[33:51] was all of the other Jews. Amen. They
[33:55] all had fallen. They were all bowing.
[33:58] They They felt Amen. They They fell
[34:00] under the pure pressure. But these men,
[34:04] they stood there for their convictions.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And And God would come in a great
[34:12] and mighty day. So, Amen. The question
[34:15] is IS WHO HAS DESPISED the day of small
[34:19] things?
[34:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD CAME IN. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS,
[34:23] "IT'S not by might nor by power, but by
[34:26] my spirit, saith the Lord."
[34:29] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS IN THIS IT WAS IN THIS DAY
[34:32] THAT of overwhelming
[34:35] uh um uh pressure upon them that they
[34:39] stood up and and God came in such an
[34:43] incredible way. And we understand that
[34:45] they turned the the heat up seven times
[34:47] more. Amen. And when they threw the men
[34:50] in, it even killed the guys that were
[34:53] that were uh throwing them in the fire.
[34:56] It killed all of the guards. Amen.
[34:59] Because it was so hot. And and and so
[35:02] they throw him in the fire. And and the
[35:05] um Amen. the 20 the the 21st verse.
[35:10] Amen. It it says, "Then these men were
[35:13] bound in their coats and their hoses and
[35:16] and their hats and their other garments
[35:18] and were cast into the midst of the
[35:21] burning fiery furnace." Therefore,
[35:23] because the king's commandment was
[35:25] urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot,
[35:27] the flame of the fire slew those men
[35:30] that took Shadrach, Meshach, and
[35:32] Abednego, and these three men, Shadrach,
[35:35] Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound
[35:38] into the midst of the fiery furnace.
[35:41] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was
[35:43] astonished and rose up in haste and
[35:46] spake and said unto the counselors, "Did
[35:49] not we cast three men bound into the
[35:53] midst of the fire?" And they answered
[35:55] and said unto the king, "True, O king."
[35:58] He answered and said, "Lo, I see four
[36:00] men loose, walking in the midst of the
[36:04] fire.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; They have no hurt, and the form of the
[36:07] fourth is like the Son of God."
[36:10] Then Nebuchadnezzar came to the mouth of
[36:12] the burning fiery furnace and spake and
[36:15] said, "Shadrach, Meshack, and Abednego,
[36:16] ye servants of the most high God, come
[36:18] forth and come hither." Then Shadrach,
[36:21] Meach, and Abednego, come forth in the
[36:23] midst of the fire.
[36:25] And the princes and the governors and
[36:28] the captains and the king's counselors
[36:31] being gathered together saw these men.
[36:34] Now, it started out they were the least.
[36:37] It started out a day of small things,
[36:39] but it ends up a pretty big day.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "TOGETHER SAW THESE men
[36:47] upon whose bodies the fire had no power,
[36:50] nor was an air of their head singed,
[36:53] neither were the coats changed, nor the
[36:56] smell of fire had passed on them." Then
[36:59] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, "Blessed
[37:01] be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
[37:03] Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and
[37:06] delivered his servants that trusted him,
[37:09] and has changed the king's word, and
[37:12] yielded their bodies that they might not
[37:14] serve nor worship any god except their
[37:18] own god."
[37:19] &gt;&gt; We can see here that there was a amen
[37:23] the how God can turn things around for
[37:26] when God with God. Amen. And the
[37:28] minority becomes a majority.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; The minority becomes a majority. And
[37:33] sometimes we feel like we're in the
[37:35] minority in our situations. But
[37:37] remember, with God, you're the majority.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter all the kings. It
[37:42] didn't matter all the kingdoms. It
[37:43] didn't matter. Amen. All of the
[37:45] counselors and all of the music. It
[37:47] didn't matter how how how much they were
[37:49] dancing and how much they were doing
[37:50] their little voodoo. Amen. When it come
[37:53] DOWN TO IT, ONE, THE PRESENCE of God
[37:56] coming on the scene because there were
[37:59] three men that held to their guns in
[38:03] conviction, it forever more changed the
[38:07] history. And that story has been told
[38:11] thousands of years.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? YOU SEE, BROTHER
[38:15] BRANDHAM WOULD SAY, I WANT YOU TO NOTICE
[38:18] he does it that way in EVERY AGE. HE
[38:20] DOES IT EVERY TIME BY the same method.
[38:22] He has to take believers and then in
[38:25] order to have believers to meet that
[38:27] word, he's got to predestinate it to
[38:29] that age. You see it? He's got to
[38:32] predestinate this thing to be there to
[38:35] meet the challenge of the age. Did it
[38:38] get you? Did you do you feel it? Do you
[38:41] see it? Do you UNDERSTAND IT? THAT'S
[38:44] WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. He's
[38:47] predestinated to this by his
[38:50] fornowledge. And it has to come. The
[38:53] rapture IS IS GOING TO BE A SEASON where
[38:58] Amen. YOU ARE LIKE THOSE THREE HEBREW
[39:01] children in the midst of this world.
[39:04] AMEN. THE ODDS ARE GOING TO BE STACKED
[39:06] AGAINST YOU. But I'm here to tell you,
[39:09] don't despise the day of small things.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. as the day started, amen, on that
[39:18] fateful day. Amen. We're the greatest
[39:20] nation putting on that incredible event.
[39:24] But those three guys, well, thank God
[39:26] for those three guys that stunk to their
[39:28] guns. Can you say amen?
[39:31] &gt;&gt; You see, THERE'S THERE'S THERE IS
[39:34] SOMETHING ABOUT as as we have stolen
[39:37] Amen. or or or used this this slogan,
[39:41] who hath despised the day of small
[39:44] things. IT WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING that
[39:47] as the spirit of the Lord had said to
[39:50] Zerubabel as he was trying to build the
[39:53] temple. AND HE WAS SO discouraged at the
[39:56] rebuilding of this temple because Amen.
[39:59] He it seemed like he was all alone and
[40:01] there were amen the enemy and and the
[40:04] forces against him. It it just really
[40:07] discouraged him. AND WHAT GOD HAD TOLD
[40:10] HIM, HE SAID, "LISTEN, AMEN. THOUGH
[40:14] GREAT MOUNTAIN, though you be great, who
[40:18] shall stand before the God of
[40:21] Zerubabel?"
[40:22] THERE IS A GREAT MOUNTAIN. AND THEN HE
[40:25] LOOKS TO Zerubabel and he says, "Not by
[40:28] might NOR BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT,
[40:33] SAYS THE LORD. FOR IT IS NOT GOING TO BE
[40:37] A DAY OF SMALL things too very long. I'm
[40:41] fixing to show my power. Well, praise
[40:44] the Lord. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS AS HE
[40:47] WAS TYPING OUT, AMEN. typing out the
[40:49] seven church ages and Amen. And he SAYS
[40:52] AS THE CAPSTONE IS COMING DOWN, THERE'S
[40:56] GOING TO BE A SHOUTING GRACE, GRACE.
[41:00] AMEN. Unmmerited favor. The church is
[41:03] going to see, amen, the supernatural
[41:06] power of God IN THEIR LIVES JUST AS
[41:09] ZERUBABEL. Now we understand, AMEN, THAT
[41:12] OUR ZERUBABEL was Malachi 4, the
[41:15] restoration as Malachi, Amen. four had
[41:18] or as as Zerubabel had lay had to relay
[41:21] THE FOUNDATION, BUILT UPON THE OLD
[41:24] FOUNDATION, AND WAS NOW PROPHESIED TO
[41:27] LAY THE CAPSTONE, THE HEADSTONE. AMEN.
[41:30] SO WAS IT PROPHESIED IN OUR DAY THAT
[41:34] THERE would be a restoration that there
[41:37] would be a Zerubabel a prophet message.
[41:40] Amen. To lay AGAIN THE OLD FOUNDATION
[41:43] but also this WOULD BE THE CAPPING OFF
[41:46] of the church. This would be the time
[41:49] where the church WOULD RISE IN ITS POWER
[41:52] WHERE SONS OF GOD WOULD COME BACK INTO
[41:54] AUTHORITY. WHERE THERE WOULD BE A
[41:56] DOMINION. AMEN. AND WE reign upon this
[41:59] earth. And I believe that day is right
[42:02] here where we are at. Amen. Don't get
[42:05] disillusioned by things around you.
[42:07] Don't get delusion. Amen. Disillusioned
[42:09] by losing your job or wondering about
[42:12] this deal with the government. Amen. Let
[42:14] me TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD IS IN
[42:16] CONTROL. GOD HAS GOT TO ALLOW THESE
[42:20] THINGS TO COME. THERE'S GOT TO BE
[42:22] DARKNESS IN ORDER FOR the light to
[42:25] prevail.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; There's got to be these things in our
[42:28] lives. Amen. But remember, we stand upon
[42:32] thus sayaith the Lord because there is a
[42:35] divine purpose RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW
[42:39] THAT IS TAKING PLACE in your situation
[42:42] and in the bride of Jesus Christ. Now
[42:45] remember the church is not this
[42:46] building. The church is made up of
[42:48] individuals. individuals that the Holy
[42:52] Spirit is building up, THAT THE HOLY
[42:54] SPIRIT is maturing because we are at the
[42:58] we ARE AT THE CLOSING. WE ARE AT THE
[43:02] FINISH LINE. We are here at THE VERY
[43:04] END. AND GOD IS LOOKING FOR MEN AND
[43:07] WOMEN WHO ARE GOING TO STAND BY GOD IN
[43:11] FAITH. And you're going TO SEE A GRACE
[43:14] upon your life like you've never seen it
[43:16] before. Amen. Now in the identified ages
[43:19] uh uh Christ of all ages 64. Amen.
[43:22] Brother Brandham said to redeem anything
[43:24] is to bring it back. Where it's fallen
[43:26] from and went from redeem it. Bring it
[43:29] back. The way you look or or or or who
[43:32] you are and or what your name IS THAT
[43:35] WAS GOD'S THINKING BEFORE THE foundation
[43:38] of the world. So he's he's he's telling
[43:40] you, AMEN. YOUR SITUATION RIGHT HERE
[43:43] WHERE YOU ARE, God knew you. You were in
[43:45] HIS THINKING. AND JESUS CAME NOT TO SAVE
[43:49] THE WHOLE THING. He wanted to, but he
[43:51] come to redeem or to bring back them
[43:56] that was in his thoughts before the
[43:58] beginning. That's the reason he was the
[44:00] word made flesh. God was in Christ
[44:03] reconciling the world to himself. The
[44:05] word, GOD'S THINKING OF HOW HE WOULD DO
[44:08] IT. HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF in Jesus
[44:10] Christ. It was God becoming material.
[44:13] Can you say amen? Amen. So he's saying
[44:16] now there's a purpose for every one of
[44:18] us and THAT IS REDEMPTION. ANOTHER PLACE
[44:20] HE SAYS GOD WHEN WHEN HE WAS AN ALIEN
[44:23] WHEN I WAS AN ALIEN FROM HIM AND SO HE
[44:26] SO LOVED ME TILL HE STOOPED DOWN TO GET
[44:29] ME AND picked me up that gives me
[44:32] confidence that he wants to use me.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did those three young men
[44:38] look at it as if God's wanting to use
[44:40] them? DID DID WERE WERE THEY JUST AMEN.
[44:44] LISTEN, I AM SURE I AM POSITIVE THAT
[44:47] THOSE MEN WEREN'T THINKING THAT GOD WAS
[44:50] using them for some special purpose.
[44:52] THEY WERE IN THE TRIAL OF THEIR LIFE.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? BUT THE PROPHET SAYS
[45:00] GOD DIDN'T JUST SAVE [screaming] YOU. HE
[45:03] PULLED YOU OUT SO THAT HE CAN SHOW his
[45:07] glory in your life. I just want to tell
[45:10] you, Amen. It would make YOU WANT TO
[45:12] SHOUT AND REJOICE a little bit more if
[45:15] you BEGIN TO SEE YOUR LIFE IS totally in
[45:18] HIS HANDS. YOUR SITUATIONS ARE TOTALLY
[45:21] IN his hands. HE DESIGNS IT. HE ALLOWS
[45:24] IT. HE BRINGS THESE THINGS IN SO THAT
[45:26] his glory can be revealed in you. Can
[45:29] you say amen? He says he's got a purpose
[45:32] in doing it. He's seen something in me.
[45:34] He's seen something in you. He had a
[45:37] reason to save you. Look at the people
[45:38] unsaved today. Look at the millions he
[45:41] could have took besides you, but he took
[45:44] you. AMEN. NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[45:49] You're in God's economy. NO ONE CAN DO
[45:52] IT. THAT'S HIS love to you.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; That's his love to those three Hebrew.
[46:00] Hallelujah. Amen. Every kid, every kid
[46:02] in Sunday school has taught about
[46:04] Shadrach, Meak, AND ABEDNEGO. THAT'S
[46:08] GOD'S love to those three men that he
[46:12] chose to stand against the odds. And in
[46:15] this finality of redemption, the message
[46:18] IS SO CRUCIAL. THIS MESSAGE IS crucial
[46:22] to you as the elect. The seals had to be
[46:25] taken off. And I want you to understand
[46:26] this. AMEN. AND THE PRESSURE HAS TO COME
[46:30] UPON THE BRIDE IN ORDER FOR THOSE SEALS
[46:34] TO TRULY BE REFLECTED IN your life.
[46:38] AMEN. WHEN SICKNESSES COME YOUR WAY,
[46:40] SITUATIONS come your way, Amen. you are
[46:43] either going to display the closed book
[46:46] of the SEVEN AGES OR THE OPEN BOOK,
[46:50] AMEN, that the angel has given us in
[46:52] this day. YOU ARE EITHER GOING TO
[46:55] OPERATE AS A SERVANT, AMEN, AND
[46:58] WONDERING WHY AND WHEN, OR YOU'RE GOING
[47:01] TO LIFT UP YOUR HEAD AND SAY, I'M A SON
[47:04] OF GOD. I'M A DAUGHTER OF GOD AND I'M
[47:07] GOING TO WALK WITH HIM. WELL, can you
[47:09] SAY AMEN? AMEN. THIS SEASON OF
[47:13] REDEMPTION, THIS SEASON OF COMING BACK
[47:16] TO OUR POSITION IS SO IMPORTANT. It's
[47:19] important for you mothers to keep the
[47:21] right kind of attitude. It's in
[47:23] Hallelujah. Amen. When you're when
[47:25] you're with your children, if there's
[47:26] ever a time to teach your children,
[47:29] Amen. that listen, keep the BLOOD OVER
[47:33] YOUR HEART. KEEP THE BLOOD OVER THE
[47:36] DOORPOST. AMEN. THE ANGEL OF DEATH IS
[47:39] STRIKING. BUT THERE IS A rapture that is
[47:42] on its way.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; If there's ever a time for daddies to
[47:45] take courage, amen, it is right now.
[47:48] Amen. Why? Because we are in the final
[47:51] leg of this journey. HALLELUJAH.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; YOUR POSITION, YOUR PLACE, you setting
[47:58] IN THE POSITION THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED
[48:01] FOR YOU in your promised land is so
[48:03] important. Just as the natural Exodus
[48:06] had to take place before there could be
[48:09] a Messiah there. They they were in the
[48:12] wrong land. Israel was in the land of
[48:15] Egypt. They were in the wrong land in
[48:18] order to receive THE MESSIAH. SO GOD HAD
[48:21] TO DO SOMETHING. AMEN. AND CAUSED THE
[48:24] PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO THEIR LAND. AND
[48:27] THERE IS WHERE GOD'S promise was and God
[48:30] raised up a Moses for that. Well, can
[48:32] you say amen? EVEN IN OUR DAY, EVEN IN
[48:34] OUR OUR OUR GENERATION, AMEN. You
[48:38] listen. JESUS, LET'S JUST GO BACK. JESUS
[48:41] COULD NOT EVEN COME TO to to become the
[48:46] Messiah unless Israel was in the
[48:50] promised land. There was no other way
[48:53] around it. Amen. Because the land was
[48:56] just as important to God AS THE MESSIAH.
[49:00] THE MESSIAH WAS PREDESTINED TO COME to
[49:04] that promised land. AND THEY HAD TO BE
[49:07] IN THEIR LAND. NOW, I WANT TO TELL YOU
[49:09] THE MESSIAH, JESUS CHRIST, IS COMING.
[49:14] AND HE CAN ONLY COME TO THOSE
[49:17] [screaming] WHO ARE IN THAT. AMEN.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[49:23] [applause and cheering]
[49:24] &gt;&gt; HE'S ONLY GOING TO COME TO THOSE AND
[49:27] RAPTURE THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR HEARTS
[49:30] WASHED, THEIR EYES OPEN, AND THEY'RE
[49:34] prepared for HIS COMING.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THAT'S the reason why GOD
[49:38] SENT US THE PROPHET. It's the reason why
[49:40] he sent us the message. This message is
[49:44] our homeland. We had to come back TO THE
[49:48] ORIGINAL in order to welcome the Lord
[49:51] Jesus Christ.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Come on
[49:53] &gt;&gt; now. Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; So the patriarchs knew that. Amen. Jacob
[50:00] says, "Don't leave my bones here in e in
[50:02] Egypt."
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Joseph said, "Don't leave my bones here
[50:06] in Egypt. Take me back. THE PROMISE IS
[50:09] COMING.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; TAKE ME BACK TO that homeland because
[50:12] there is where the Messiah." Well, can
[50:14] you say amen?
[50:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, WHY DID GOD HAVE TO
[50:18] HARDEN PHARAOH'S HEART? WHY DID GOD ARE
[50:22] Y'ALL HEARING ME?
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Why did God HAVE TO HARDEN Pharaoh's
[50:28] heart? IS FOR ISRAEL TO BECOME AMEN. TO
[50:33] PUT THE THE PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR
[50:35] PROMISED LAND SO THAT he could bless
[50:38] them and bring forth the Messiah to
[50:41] them. HALLELUJAH. SO, THERE HAD TO BE,
[50:45] "WE DON'T WANT TO STAY IN this world.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Come [snorts] on.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; I don't want to stay in this world. I
[50:50] know you don't want to stay in this
[50:52] world. And we've been promised a
[50:53] homeland. We've been promised a rapture.
[50:56] AND WE'RE PREPARING. NOW, NOW, NOW
[50:59] THERE'S THERE'S A LOT GOING ON." AMEN.
[51:01] YOU CANNOT BE OUT OF YOUR LAND AND AND
[51:05] receive the promise. Now, listen.
[51:08] It's important. Amen. WE'RE TESTED AND
[51:11] WE'RE TRIED AND THE AND THE TRIALS ARE
[51:14] ALL AROUND US.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The hardships are there. And it's
[51:18] important that you stay in that promised
[51:22] word. Whether it be for your healing,
[51:24] &gt;&gt; whether it be in holiness, whether it be
[51:27] in Amen and how you raise your family.
[51:30] This is very important that we run
[51:33] everything according to an open book.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T FOLLOW WHAT AMEN. DR. JONES
[51:39] SAYS OR AMEN A PSYCHOLOGIST SAYS OR OR
[51:43] ANY OTHER MAN SAYS WE'VE GOT TO stay in
[51:47] God's word.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Now listen friends. Amen. We've got to
[51:51] make sure that our lives are are lined
[51:54] up with his word.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. GOD'S DESIRE should
[51:58] be our command.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; GOD'S DESIRE SHOULD BE OUR COMMAND.

[52:05] boy, they didn't they they they everyone
[52:08] there were many Jews. There were
[52:09] hundreds of thousands of Jews there.
[52:12] Amen. And they all bowed. But there were
[52:14] three men that said, "No, we're going to
[52:17] keep it according to the word of God."
[52:20] And it was God that took their small
[52:22] things.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; It was God who took their small things
[52:26] and made it big. Can you say amen?
[52:30] HALLELUJAH. SO THAT'S RIGHT. THE WORLD
[52:32] NEVER GETS it right. Amen. SOME OF THE
[52:35] GREATEST BIBLE PROPHECY IS HAPPENING
[52:37] RIGHT NOW.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; You know, even even some of the the the
[52:41] the greatest Bible prophecy for Israel,

[58:10] things that he accomplished.
[58:12] Amen. Nero was was the great emperor in
[58:15] Rome. But in all reality, the really big

[58:20] history, there was the saints gathering
[58:24] in catacombs,
[58:25] in prayer meetings, calling unto God,
[58:28] and there was a supernatural something
[58:30] that was taking place that was fixing to
[58:33] birth a worldwide move. Amen. Well, can
[58:36] you say amen? You see, Amen. I I I have
[58:39] a few things here down through history.
[58:41] The the Medici brothers, Amen, must have
[58:44] seemed like they were the key figures in
[58:46] Europe. Now, these guys were the you you
[58:48] guys, Amen. I know they were powerful

[59:38] GENANOA. AMEN. AND THIS BOY WOULD END UP
[59:42] AMEN. EVENTUALLY opening the seaway to

[59:52] they're just a thought. BUT BUT BUT BUT
[59:54] CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS and and WHAT HE'D

[1:00:00] I WANT TO TELL YOU, CHRISTOPHER
[1:00:01] COLUMBUS, AMEN. OH, you know how he
[1:00:03] Hallelujah. He had a dream. He had a
[1:00:05] dream that the world was round. And he
[1:00:07] wanted to prove it. And and and and the
[1:00:09] king would only give them amen. Deadbeat
[1:00:12] men out of jails and prisons to be Amen.
[1:00:15] for his shipmates. and and it looked
[1:00:18] like IT WAS IT WOULD JUST LOOK LIKE IT
[1:00:19] was just such a
[1:00:22] you know he was discouraged BUT YOU SEE
[1:00:24] AMEN IN THOSE SMALL THINGS the Americas
[1:00:28] were founded and the gospel was brought
[1:00:31] and a prophet WAS BORN AND A BRIDE IS RE
[1:00:34] WELL PRAISE THE LORD. SO, SO IN THE
[1:00:37] SHADOW IN THE SHADOW OF THE OF OF THE

[1:00:58] GOVERNORS AND THE AND THE PRINCES AND
[1:01:00] THE KINGS THAT ARE ALL TRYING TO FIND
[1:01:02] PEACE. I WONDER IF THE REAL NEWS IS A
[1:01:06] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WHO WAS BEING
[1:01:09] PREPARED TO GO IN A RAPTURE FOR A BODY
[1:01:13] CHANGE.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Being prepared.
[1:01:18] Hallelujah.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist
[1:01:22] must have seemed very small and
[1:01:25] insignificant
[1:01:27] to Herod.
[1:01:33] There Herod prouncing around with all of
[1:01:35] his pomp and power and whenever he went
[1:01:40] around people bowed and you know waiting
[1:01:44] for a no a nod from the trearch
[1:01:48] and and yet and this Herod ended up
[1:01:52] killing John
[1:01:54] ended up killing John for his message.
[1:01:59] But when Jesus
[1:02:01] was telling the disciples after he was
[1:02:04] telling the disciples, he's saying,
[1:02:05] "Listen
[1:02:07] now, I know you all are looking at John
[1:02:09] and he's been in prison and he's but
[1:02:12] there is not a greater
[1:02:15] there is not a greater man born of a
[1:02:18] woman than that John the Baptist."
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; For he was called to forerun
[1:02:26] the the the coming of the Lord. Come on.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now think about that. Herod
[1:02:32] had the power to having killed, but
[1:02:35] Herod was only for but John was
[1:02:38] fulfilling his eternal purpose.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; PILATE IN THE DAYS OF JESUS, PILATE
[1:02:45] HAVING THE POWER TO HAVE HIM CRUCIFIED,
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; but then he didn't have the power to
[1:02:52] wash his hands.
[1:02:54] He didn't have the power to to clean his
[1:02:57] guilty hands.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; IN IN SODOM AND GOMORRAH. AMEN. IT WAS
[1:03:03] THE place in the days of Abraham. IT WAS
[1:03:08] THE PLACE.
[1:03:10] LOT AND IS AND MRS. LOT RAISED A FAMILY
[1:03:14] DOWN THERE.
[1:03:16] AND IT SEEMED IN FACT THEY he become the
[1:03:19] mayor and they become very very
[1:03:21] important people. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:25] Glory to God. It was the hub of the
[1:03:27] region. There was the water. They had
[1:03:29] the waterways and the crops and the
[1:03:31] great achievements of the day. Totally
[1:03:33] overshadowed
[1:03:34] that old man by the name of Abraham.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Totally overshadowed him.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; They were DOWN THERE WITH ALL OF THEIR
[1:03:41] WITH WITH ALL OF ALL OF THAT. AND here
[1:03:44] Abraham WAS CONSIDERED SO WEIRD AND SO
[1:03:48] INSIGNIFICANT.
[1:03:50] AND IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT. AND EVEN
[1:03:54] Jesus would say that it would be the
[1:03:55] same AS THIS DAY
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT.
[1:04:01] WHEN WHEN WHEN SODOM AND GOMORRAH
[1:04:03] [screaming] AND ALL OF THE SIN AND THE
[1:04:05] PLEASURE HAD OVERSHADOWED Abraham and
[1:04:08] his promise,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; so is the son of man going to return and
[1:04:13] talk to you and give life to you
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; just like he spoke to Abwell. It was in
[1:04:20] that season that Melzdc, God came down,
[1:04:25] created him a body, moved on the inside
[1:04:27] of that and come and discerned the heart
[1:04:30] of Sarah and Abraham.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD DIDN'T SEE IT.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; THE [screaming] WORLD DIDN'T. IT WAS A
[1:04:38] DAY OF VERY SMALL THINGS,

[1:05:23] blessed you young people with MOTHERS
[1:05:25] THAT STAY AT home so that you YOU KIDS

[1:05:37] THAT DAY OF SMALL THINGS. ENTER INTO

[1:05:43] LITERAL closet if you need it. AMEN.
[1:05:45] I'VE CRAWLED INTO MY CLOSET MANY OF
[1:05:47] TIMES. YOU KNOW, I felt really good when

[1:11:13] so important. When you know that the
[1:11:16] authority is upon you. Amen. Then you
[1:11:19] must stand as a SON OF GOD. YOU KNOW YOU
[1:11:23] HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. How can you sherk
[1:11:25] that responsibility? How can you sherk
[1:11:28] prayer? HOW CAN YOU SHERK DEVOTION? HOW

[1:12:46] "I'M NOT BOWING TO the littlest thing."
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; It's a small thing.
[1:12:52] It's a day of small things. [snorts]

[1:12:57] VINE.
[1:12:58] IT'S A DAY OF LITTLE things
[1:13:03] that the prophet said would end up
[1:13:06] destroying the vine. The little foxes.
[1:13:09] It's the DAY OF THE LITTLE THINGS, not
[1:13:12] the big. No, I'm not out smoking AND
[1:13:15] CUSSING. IT'S THE LITTLE [screaming]
[1:13:17] THINGS THAT WE EXCUSE. IT'S THE LITTLE
[1:13:20] THINGS THAT WE THAT WE ALLOW. WELL,

[1:13:29] you're when when you're sick. Amen. And
[1:13:32] you know that the word of God tells you
[1:13:33] that you've got to have a positive
[1:13:35] attitude and you refuse to get up and
[1:13:37] open your shades. Hallelujah. Turn the
[1:13:40] lights on and get that gloomy spirit out
[1:13:41] of that house so that you amen can pro
[1:13:44] show forth a miracle. AMEN. BUT IT'S THE
[1:13:47] LITTLE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SIT
[1:13:49] THERE AND LAY THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO
[1:13:51] ALLOW THE DEVIL TO JUST AMEN JUST ROT
[1:13:53] AWAY AT OUR FAITH. BUT IT'S THE IT'S THE
[1:13:56] DAY OF SMALL [screaming] THINGS. SERUM,
[1:13:59] I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG MOUNTAIN, BUT
[1:14:02] IT'S A DAY [screaming] OF SMALL THINGS.
[1:14:04] OH, CHURCH, NEW LIFE OUTREACH. I KNOW
[1:14:07] THE MOUNTAINS MAY LOOK BIG, BUT IT'S A
[1:14:10] DAY OF SMALL THINGS. GET THE [screaming]
[1:14:12] SMALL THINGS. THERE'S GRACE FOR THE
[1:14:14] SMALL THINGS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A DAY
[1:14:17] of eternal victory in your life.
[1:14:21] [applause]
[1:14:23] IT'S THOSE DAYS of
[1:14:27] those little things
[1:14:29] that gnaw at our conscience.
[1:14:32] Amen. That's eroding our faith.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now. But you see, don't forget
[1:14:39] the fact
[1:14:41] Trump's in the headlines and he's loving
[1:14:44] it. He just loves it. And just in case
[1:14:47] y'all don't know, there had never been a
[1:14:49] war. Amen. There would have never been a
[1:14:52] war if he had been president. Amen. Just
[1:14:55] in case he's not told you that. [snorts]
[1:14:59] There he's got all kind He's just He's
[1:15:02] proud of himself and he he's Hallelujah.
[1:15:05] And there's a lot of headlines of hate
[1:15:08] and a lot of headlines of love.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; But in between that, Trump isn't the
[1:15:14] focus of the hour.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Russia is not the focus of the hour.
[1:15:20] In fact,
[1:15:22] in fact,
[1:15:25] the Bible says in these days it's going
[1:15:27] to be wars and rumors of wars and
[1:15:29] there's no peace negotiations going to
[1:15:31] do anything.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And the prophets already told us that
[1:15:35] our economy is going to tank. It's got
[1:15:37] to tank.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. SO WHEN IT'S ALL
[1:15:41] SAID AND done and you're looking back,
[1:15:48] when you're looking back,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; will it matter?
[1:15:55] I TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
[1:15:57] MATTERS. LET'S GO BACK TO 1993.

[1:17:12] tsunami in India. There was an
[1:17:14] earthquake that centered in Caleria. Uh

[1:17:40] heard of John
[1:17:43] um John Lei?
[1:17:46] Well, we all know John Lay. John Lay is
[1:17:50] the little old guy that got a big belly
[1:17:53] on him now, but man,
[1:17:55] he's not a preacher.
[1:17:57] He's not he's he's not
[1:18:01] John Lei just had a burden for the
[1:18:05] Chinese to get the message into the

[1:18:22] Lord would blind the eyes of those guys
[1:18:25] as he was taking these messages into
[1:18:27] China. Done it over and over. And he was
[1:18:30] going around just he had had a few of
[1:18:32] these message books. He man printed in
[1:18:35] in in Chinese. And he was just going
[1:18:38] around. Did you know that Chinese that

[1:18:45] explosion of the message?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:49] THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS and thousands of
[1:18:52] Chinese and it started in 1993
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; when all the headlines were just oh they

[1:19:02] headlines the Republicans and Democrats
[1:19:04] were after oh my the Republicans were
[1:19:06] after Bill Clinton. There were all of
[1:19:08] these things going on and yes he was
[1:19:10] cheating on his wife with all of those
[1:19:11] women BUT WE AIN'T ALL OF THAT WAS GOING
[1:19:14] ON. No one even knew the name
[1:19:18] of brother John Lei. He still lives
[1:19:20] today.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; What was the big thing?
[1:19:31] One soul is worth 10,000 worlds.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; John Lelay BROUGHT THE MESSAGE. HE WAS
[1:19:38] NOT EVEN A PREACHER.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:19:43] But he didn't despise the day.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't despise the day of small
[1:19:51] things. Listen to me, young people.
[1:19:52] Don't despise the day of small things.
[1:19:56] Those small prayer meetings will lead to
[1:19:58] huge power. That small dedication to the
[1:20:01] Lord. Amen. And that keeping yourself
[1:20:04] not not not not as close to the world as

[1:20:58] there in 196.
[1:21:01] See when was that? when brother Brandham
[1:21:03] was was there in um
[1:21:06] uh
[1:21:08] it's in I believe it's in ' 65. I've got
[1:21:10] it down here, but I I'm all over the
[1:21:13] place here tonight. Hallelujah. But
[1:21:15] brother Brandham uh but you remember
[1:21:17] when he was preaching that that service
[1:21:20] and and um um uh birth pains, birth
[1:21:25] painans. Now, now, Brother Brandham is
[1:21:28] is is is wanting to preach birth pains
[1:21:32] and um and and and he he can't get his
[1:21:35] book. He can't find the scripture. Y'all
[1:21:37] remember that?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; He's looking for the scripture and he
[1:21:39] can't find the scripture. And uh and and
[1:21:43] his his wife had just bought him a new
[1:21:44] Bible and and he's man, he he asked the
[1:21:47] other brothers. He says, "I man, there
[1:21:49] it is. The page there's here's this
[1:21:51] page." And I turn it over and there they
[1:21:53] did not put that page in my Bible. and
[1:21:56] uh uh and and and just couldn't find
[1:21:58] him, you know, and if he was fumbling
[1:22:00] around for a long time and it was a
[1:22:02] Catholic priest.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I think sometimes we get
[1:22:08] we get too we get too upset too easy.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; We get too fuzzled too easy when God may
[1:22:15] be just want maybe in that little small
[1:22:18] thing right there.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:21] this Catholic priest that brother
[1:22:23] Brandham says he had been watching him
[1:22:24] throughout the meetings and he said this
[1:22:26] guy is for sure not agreeing with me you
[1:22:28] know I mean and I would say that was
[1:22:30] probably true SO BUT HE COMES over with
[1:22:34] his Bible he comes he gets up comes
[1:22:37] across he said there's 200 preachers up
[1:22:39] there he says he comes over and you can
[1:22:42] hear him on the on on the on the dealers
[1:22:46] and and and just saying stay steady my
[1:22:48] son you know and uh the Lord is wanting
[1:22:51] to do something or something like he
[1:22:52] said, "Read out of my book." Well,
[1:22:53] Brother Brandham reads it. He gets he he
[1:22:56] reads the scripture he's wanting to
[1:22:57] read. Then he hands it back over to the
[1:22:59] priest and and and then he he goes on
[1:23:02] preaching and buddy did he preach a
[1:23:05] message. How many's ever heard birth
[1:23:07] painans? Oh my word, brother Brandham.
[1:23:09] It was it was beautiful. If you've not
[1:23:11] listened to birth pains lately, you need
[1:23:12] to go back and listen to birth painans.
[1:23:13] It was just an incredible message.
[1:23:17] Well, he comes the next day
[1:23:21] and then the Holy Spirit hits him and
[1:23:25] says, "This day, this scripture is
[1:23:29] fulfilled." Now, here he Now here he is.
[1:23:32] Jesus was handed he was handed the book
[1:23:36] by the priest. He read the book. Amen.
[1:23:39] And then he wrote he he read he read
[1:23:42] this the anointing. The spirit of the
[1:23:43] Lord is upon me anointed me to preach
[1:23:45] the gospel. And when he got through, he
[1:23:47] gave the book back and he said, "This
[1:23:49] day, this scripture is fulfilled,
[1:23:54] the spirit of the Lord come upon him and
[1:23:55] said that was prophetic that had to take
[1:24:00] place." Are y'all understanding me? And
[1:24:02] it become a major. Then you go back and
[1:24:05] listen. Go back and listen. Amen. in
[1:24:09] Jeffersonville when he preaches this day
[1:24:12] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:24:15] AND HE STANDS UP THERE UNDER THE SIGN OF
[1:24:18] MELCHAZDC, REMEMBER? AND HE TURNS HIS
[1:24:21] BACK TO THE AUDIENCE and begins TO TO
[1:24:25] PERFORM THE THE THE SON OF MAN SIGN
[1:24:30] RIGHT THERE.
[1:24:32] AND HE SAYS, [screaming] "THIS DAY,
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; It never could have happened
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; if it hadn't been for that one service."
[1:24:47] Sister Ma was so embarrassed. She got
[1:24:51] she told Brother Brandham on the way
[1:24:52] home, she said, "I was sweating. I was
[1:24:55] so embarrassed to watch you fumbling
[1:24:56] around. I just bought you that Bible."
[1:24:59] And they're of all Bibles. Amen. And
[1:25:01] when they went and looked that because
[1:25:03] it was a new Bible, it the pages were
[1:25:05] glued together. They were stuck. But
[1:25:07] see, God allowed that.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:25:12] you you know, you may be walking in a
[1:25:14] day. You may you
[1:25:16] [gasps]
[1:25:18] you may be thinking, "WHERE IS GOD?" YOU
[1:25:21] MAY BE THINKING, "WHY?" YOU [screaming]
[1:25:23] MAY BE ASKING, "WHAT? WHERE'S THIS
[1:25:25] GOING?" WHEN GOD IS LOOKING FOR YOU TO
[1:25:29] stand up in the off in in the in the
[1:25:33] opice of an open book, not a closed
[1:25:36] book. Closed book, you don't understand
[1:25:38] what's going on. Closed book, you you're
[1:25:40] just you're just hitting in the dark
[1:25:41] LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER NOMINAL
[1:25:43] CHRISTIANS. THIS ain't you.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; The revelation is here. You understand
[1:25:48] sicknesses are here to overcome.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; AND THAT YOU YOURSELF, NOT A PREACHER,
[1:25:54] YOU are going to overcome that devil.
[1:25:58] [applause]
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; See, back in Pentecost, we were all
[1:26:01] following. We was all following the guys
[1:26:03] with the gifts.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Prophesy over me. Hey, hey, hey, hey,
[1:26:06] lay hands over me. But the bride, it's
[1:26:08] not a one-man ministry anymore.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE OPEN BOOK. WE'VE HEARD
[1:26:15] FROM THE ANGEL OF GOD. WE'VE GOT THIS
[1:26:17] BOOK AND IT HAS it has solidified our
[1:26:21] hearts.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; We know who we are.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; We not standing here just going, I don't
[1:26:28] know. I don't know. I just wish God I
[1:26:31] just wish God would do something. I just
[1:26:33] I don't know where I'm at. DON'T KNOW
[1:26:34] WHAT'S OH, COME ON. YOU DO KNOW WHERE
[1:26:36] YOU ARE. YOU KNOW THE ENEMY IS FIGHTING.
[1:26:39] YOU KNOW THAT SATAN IS COMING AGAINST
[1:26:41] YOU. AND YOU know that the anointing IS
[1:26:44] UPON YOU TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY RIGHT NOW.
[1:26:48] [applause]
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And if the prophet had to dedicate his
[1:26:55] life and dedicate and and be constant in
[1:26:57] prayer and consecration, if Jesus had to
[1:26:59] be constant in prayer and consecration,
[1:27:01] then I think that it should become a
[1:27:03] very much of a routine for you and me.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Consecration before God.
[1:27:13] Some of you teenagers are here
[1:27:18] and maybe
[1:27:21] you're still trying to find purpose.
[1:27:24] [snorts]
[1:27:25] Maybe maybe
[1:27:28] you don't really know what you want to
[1:27:30] be yet. You don't know whether you're
[1:27:33] going to be a
[1:27:35] rocket scientist or a
[1:27:38] a policeman.
[1:27:42] And those are those are fine. Those are
[1:27:44] good times, though. I mean, well,
[1:27:45] they're not they're not good times.
[1:27:48] A lot of agony sometimes that you young
[1:27:52] men, young women go through in your
[1:27:53] minds,
[1:27:56] a lot of questions, a lot of things
[1:27:57] swirling.
[1:28:00] But I can remember back as a young man
[1:28:02] if there's anything that that helped me
[1:28:07] as I I chose the path of dedication,
[1:28:12] consecration,
[1:28:14] prayer.
[1:28:18] I didn't quite understand it all. I
[1:28:20] wasn't in the message,
[1:28:23] but that was something that I'd seen in
[1:28:24] mom and dad and the anointing upon their
[1:28:27] lives and the and the power of God in
[1:28:29] their lives.
[1:28:32] And I wanted that kind of a life upon
[1:28:35] me. And I knew that daddy couldn't give
[1:28:37] it to me and mama couldn't give it to me
[1:28:38] and my preacher couldn't give it to me.
[1:28:40] I knew that it could only come through a
[1:28:42] yielded vessel.
[1:28:44] And I I I say there was not a better
[1:28:47] time to do it
[1:28:50] than at this stage of life. Now, it's
[1:28:52] it's hard because you're fighting a lot
[1:28:54] of mind battles and there's a lot of
[1:28:55] things that you go through in your mind
[1:28:58] and sometimes when you're praying,
[1:29:00] Satan's telling you that you're you're a
[1:29:02] loser and you're always going to be a
[1:29:04] loser and you're praying, you know, but
[1:29:06] he but he's he's a he's a liar, man.
[1:29:11] Someone said one time, "Do you know c
[1:29:13] can you tell when when the devil's
[1:29:14] lying?" And I said, 'Well, well, what
[1:29:16] what tell me said, "When he opens his
[1:29:19] mouth." Hallelujah.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; So, the devil's always going to lie.
[1:29:24] He's always going to God's not going to
[1:29:25] tell you you're worthless.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; The anointing would not even come upon
[1:29:28] you and then tell you you're worthless.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; The anointing will tell you you need to
[1:29:32] come up higher. The anointing will tell
[1:29:34] you you need to you need to quit doing
[1:29:36] this. The anointing will tell you, "Hey,
[1:29:38] you need to straighten up here. God's
[1:29:40] real."
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And God will God will come upon you and
[1:29:44] he'll begin to he'll he'll he'll he'll
[1:29:46] weed things out in your life. You won't
[1:29:48] even have to have a you won't even have
[1:29:50] to have a preacher to it. It's it that
[1:29:53] that Holy Spirit will produce holiness
[1:29:57] in your life.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; It'll produce holiness in you.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'LL MAKE GOD'S way the absolute,
[1:30:07] it'll make God's way your only way that
[1:30:11] that you'll ever want to live. SO, SO AS
[1:30:15] AS YOU BEGIN TO CONSECRATE YOURSELF, and
[1:30:18] I don't think you're too young to do it.
[1:30:21] I know the Holy Spirit really started
[1:30:23] dealing with my life when I was 11, 12
[1:30:25] years old. Amen. And about that time to
[1:30:28] where the spirit of the Lord really
[1:30:30] dealt with me. And and and mom's advice
[1:30:35] was was Wendle, if while the Lord's
[1:30:37] dealing with you, you need to really
[1:30:39] spend time in prayer. Get get along. Get
[1:30:43] alone. And uh uh I shared a room with my
[1:30:47] brother and and so lots of times I was
[1:30:50] in the closet. Hallelujah. And I I I'd
[1:30:53] go in there and I'd pray, but I was
[1:30:56] still a little inhibited thinking that
[1:30:57] he was listening to me praying or
[1:30:58] someone else was listening to me praying
[1:31:00] besides God. And uh and so I I so I I
[1:31:04] got me a key to the church and got my
[1:31:05] back and I would drive down to the
[1:31:07] church on a daily basis and I'd go down
[1:31:09] and I had my time of prayer.
[1:31:12] What was I doing?
[1:31:14] I was taking advantage of the day of
[1:31:18] small things. I wasn't a preacher. I
[1:31:21] wasn't even writing songs.
[1:31:24] I was learning the guitar. I was But I
[1:31:28] wanted I wanted God's approval in my
[1:31:30] life. If you feel the anointing upon
[1:31:34] your life, and I believe there comes a
[1:31:37] time in you young people's lives where
[1:31:40] you're going to feel that anointing
[1:31:41] because you're the elect of God. And
[1:31:43] when the anointing comes down upon your
[1:31:46] lives, don't despise that little
[1:31:49] something that God is doing and and and
[1:31:52] and and doing in your heart. I'm telling
[1:31:54] you, once you get to where you're you
[1:31:57] you know, you you ask you you can ask
[1:31:59] ask Dylan now that he's working
[1:32:01] full-time, it's a little bit harder to
[1:32:03] pray, right? Ask Austin now that he's
[1:32:06] married full-time. Hallelujah. And uh
[1:32:09] Rose says, "No, you should be asking
[1:32:11] me." Amen. And uh uh but it is it is
[1:32:16] there is not a better time
[1:32:20] to root yourself
[1:32:23] in the things of God than right now.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; There's not a better time.
[1:32:33] And in order to walk with God,
[1:32:37] you've got to root out those things that
[1:32:39] are displeasing, that you know are not
[1:32:42] right. When you start walking with God,
[1:32:44] you start praying. I promise you, if
[1:32:47] you've been telling lies, the Holy
[1:32:50] Spirit's just going to
[1:32:52] in your soul. He's going to tell you,
[1:32:54] and you are either going to quit praying
[1:32:59] or you're going to have to go make some
[1:33:00] confession to mammas and daddy or
[1:33:02] whoever. say, "Listen, I I I've been
[1:33:06] alive."
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S THAT DAY OF SMALL THINGS. GOD'S
[1:33:12] REVEALING those little foxes, those
[1:33:14] little things in your life that if
[1:33:16] you'll take care of those things right
[1:33:17] now and you begin to repent right now
[1:33:20] and you start walking with God right
[1:33:22] now, there is no telling what God can do
[1:33:24] for you. Amen. When when you become a
[1:33:27] young man.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Right.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; I WAS I WAS ALREADY I WAS ALREADY SAVING
[1:33:33] SOULS HERE IN PAWNE. YOU KNOW, I WAS 19
[1:33:36] YEARS OLD uh driving driving that car.
[1:33:38] We was talking about that back in the
[1:33:40] office. And congratulations, brother
[1:33:42] Caleb, on that nice fancy car he's
[1:33:44] bought. Amen. We're we're we're thankful
[1:33:47] for brother Caleb.
[1:33:49] [applause]
[1:33:50] and uh yeah, you know, looking at his
[1:33:52] car and then we got this, you know, one
[1:33:53] of them's got a F-250 and then there's
[1:33:56] or F-150 and uh I've got the 250 and uh
[1:34:00] but and they've got they've got these,
[1:34:02] you know, all all these all these young
[1:34:03] people with their cars and nice cars and
[1:34:05] I said, I remember when I was 19, we uh
[1:34:08] we had just gotten married and we were
[1:34:10] we were driving back and forth from from
[1:34:12] Prior, Oklahoma to Pawne. We were just
[1:34:14] doing uh prayer meetings, Bible studies
[1:34:16] up here. And uh uh there was hardly ever
[1:34:18] a time that our car didn't break down
[1:34:21] and we'd be stuck on the highway. Uh we
[1:34:24] didn't have phones with lights, folks.
[1:34:27] That that was that was way back in the
[1:34:29] pre Amen. It was it was a it was that
[1:34:33] day with no lights. Amen. No lights, no
[1:34:35] cell phones. And uh uh it would be dark
[1:34:38] out there on that highway. uh whether
[1:34:41] you was going to, you know, to Cleveland
[1:34:43] or whether you was going out there on
[1:34:45] the turnpack and and I and I remember
[1:34:47] that. BUT BUT THAT WAS BUT THAT WAS BUT
[1:34:50] WE WERE DOING SOMETHING FOR THE LORD.
[1:34:53] Doing something FOR THE LORD. NOW THAT
[1:34:55] WAS A DAY OF BIG things for me. See, I
[1:34:57] had all we we had been praying and and
[1:34:59] those kinds of things and I was BEING
[1:35:01] ABLE TO HELP. NOW TO SOMEBODY ELSE, NO,
[1:35:04] it wasn't a day of big things for them.
[1:35:06] They were thinking, "Ah, you know, give
[1:35:08] that little boy something to do. Get him
[1:35:09] out of our hair. Amen. But see, I was
[1:35:12] taking that seriously AND I WAS
[1:35:15] BAPTIZING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT.
[1:35:17] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I was I I was I

[1:35:23] uh uh leading them to the Lord, doing
[1:35:25] everything I could. I HAD SOMETHING in
[1:35:28] my hand to do and I wasn't looking at,
[1:35:31] well, what about that preacher? What
[1:35:34] what that's not THE CASE. THE DEAL IS
[1:35:37] I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; AND IF I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO, THEN
[1:35:43] LET ME DO IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART, MY
[1:35:46] MIND, my soul.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Let me do it with everything. Can you
[1:35:49] say amen?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; So I say today as we are preparing to
[1:35:53] close and my message has gone a little
[1:35:55] bit differently than what I had planned,
[1:35:57] but
[1:35:59] amen. in this day of preparation for the
[1:36:03] rapture.
[1:36:09] It's the little things,
[1:36:12] girls, when y'all's doing your wedding.

[1:36:16] done. Right.

[1:36:24] I've married a few people. Us guys don't
[1:36:27] care. you girls.
[1:36:30] Amen.
[1:36:33] And it's usually always, "Brother
[1:36:34] Wendle,
[1:36:36] don't keep us up there a long time."
[1:36:38] Amen.
[1:36:43] Now, BUT YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THESE
[1:36:46] preparations
[1:36:47] that you are doing. It's the little
[1:36:50] things that make up the wedding.
[1:36:56] Now, listen. The Lord Jesus is coming.
[1:36:59] He ain't marrying the girl down the
[1:37:01] road.
[1:37:03] He's marrying you.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; He's coming after you.
[1:37:09] And I understand that that that the that
[1:37:12] that the union is taking place here, but
[1:37:14] I'm saying that we're fixing to see him
[1:37:16] face to face.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; We're fixing to see his face.
[1:37:21] We're going to know exactly what he
[1:37:23] looks like.
[1:37:25] and we shall be like him
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; for we shall see him as he is.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Don't despise the day
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; of small things.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I could go on and on and on. Masams
[1:37:41] and daddies, don't despise it. Love
[1:37:42] these children while you've got them.
[1:37:43] They grow up quick. They grow up quick.
[1:37:47] Love them while you've got them.
[1:37:49] and make sure and all of you I you you
[1:37:52] get them name brand clothes if you want
[1:37:54] to get them give them
[1:37:58] buy them cars whatever you got to want
[1:37:59] to do
[1:38:04] but if they don't have a relationship
[1:38:06] with Jesus Christ by the time they move
[1:38:08] out of their your house
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; it's going to be tough
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; and I'm here to tell you take this very
[1:38:17] serious and it's not and tell them,
[1:38:19] "I've told you you need to do that. Go
[1:38:21] read that book. Go listen to that
[1:38:22] message." They need to see it in your
[1:38:24] life.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; They need to see it in your life. No
[1:38:28] schooling. Well, schooling is it.
[1:38:30] Schooling's it. Amen. By by you living
[1:38:33] that life. It's those small things that
[1:38:36] we live leave undone.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; It's those little prayer meetings that
[1:38:40] we live leave undone. It's that little
[1:38:43] uh devotion time that we live leave
[1:38:45] undone. And it and it and it and it's so
[1:38:47] easy for for us to do that. Can you say
[1:38:50] amen?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, we're going
[1:38:54] home.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; We're going home.
[1:38:57] And I want to say here today, may we
[1:39:00] live under the anointing and influence
[1:39:03] of the Almighty God.
[1:39:06] Hallelujah.
[1:39:08] Well, glory to God. Do you love him?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; if the musicians would come.
[1:39:21] [crying]
[1:39:23] I think about these things
[1:39:25] sometimes. I think about those those
[1:39:28] things like that that
[1:39:32] I heard a story.
[1:39:34] Jason Jackson told me a story
[1:39:37] one time of his mother when she was a
[1:39:40] girl. Y'all heard Jason Jackson story of
[1:39:42] his mother when she was a girl. a girl
[1:39:45] um seven or eight years old
[1:39:50] and uh
[1:39:52] uh she she had
[1:39:55] uh her heart was racing so fast
[1:39:59] and they get her to the hospital and her
[1:40:01] and her and and her heart's quit her
[1:40:03] heart quits beating.
[1:40:05] They got they it it happens so quick
[1:40:09] that the doctor pulls out his pocketk
[1:40:11] knife,
[1:40:14] cuts her open,
[1:40:17] and starts massaging her heart.
[1:40:20] I said, "You're kidding." He said,
[1:40:22] "That's the absolute truth." But he
[1:40:24] saved her life.
[1:40:28] And and he done it so quickly and
[1:40:30] instinct. It was just so it was it was
[1:40:34] they said that was the only way it it
[1:40:36] could go.
[1:40:42] And I thought, why would the girl why
[1:40:44] would why why would that happen? And
[1:40:48] then why would God save spare the little
[1:40:50] girl? Why would God
[1:40:53] knew that Jason was going to be a a
[1:40:56] wonderful preacher of this message.
[1:41:01] It was a little thing there. It was just
[1:41:02] a little girl and
[1:41:05] and you can overlook that thing. But if
[1:41:07] that girl would have died there, what
[1:41:09] about all of the all of the hundreds of
[1:41:13] souls that Jason, Brother Jason Jackson,
[1:41:18] he's preached here for us. Wonderful
[1:41:20] preacher.
[1:41:26] We just don't
[1:41:30] Don't under over Don't ever
[1:41:32] underestimate [music]
[1:41:34] what God is doing right now in you.
[1:41:37] Right now, your situation. Maybe you can
[1:41:39] just right now in your situation. Maybe
[1:41:41] you're [music] looking at a bunch of
[1:41:43] small things.
[1:41:48] Has God put them in your life to show
[1:41:50] his glory through you?
[1:41:56] I say so.
[1:41:59] I say [music] so.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:10] Satan has tried to take you out. Satan's
[1:42:12] tried to destroy you. Satan's [music]
[1:42:13] tried to take away your faith. But you
[1:42:15] can't be because you're the anointed of
[1:42:17] God.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You're the anointed of God. You're just
[1:42:23] as predestinated and anointed as Jesus
[1:42:26] Christ was.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Satan has not taken you out and he
[1:42:37] cannot take you out.
[1:42:40] We have a purpose.
[1:42:44] Let us rise.
[1:42:51] You say, "Well, you know,
[1:42:54] even, you know, if you get in trouble or
[1:42:56] you get, you know, something, well, you
[1:42:57] know, it's just No, God's allowed. God's
[1:43:00] talking to you. He's talking to you
[1:43:02] young people. You get in trouble on
[1:43:04] something or you get this, that, and the
[1:43:05] other, you know, what whatever
[1:43:08] he's he's talking to you.
[1:43:11] Don't despise that day.
[1:43:16] Let anything that God allows in your
[1:43:19] life,
[1:43:20] let it be
[1:43:24] that he's bringing you closer because
[1:43:26] this is bigger than Donald Trump [music]
[1:43:31] and this is bigger than the prime
[1:43:33] minister of Japan.
[1:43:36] This is bigger than the big beautiful
[1:43:39] bill.
[1:43:43] What's happening in this building here
[1:43:45] tonight is big. This is big. This is
[1:43:49] big. [music]
[1:43:53] This is the one that God come to earth
[1:43:56] for. He come to earth for you. All of
[1:43:58] this others cannon fodder. It's all
[1:44:00] going to burn. It's all going to burn.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; They'll still be having politics and
[1:44:05] having their wars and they're, [music]
[1:44:08] you know, shutting down the government.
[1:44:09] They'll do it again next year and and we
[1:44:11] may be gone by then. and they'll just
[1:44:12] they'll keep on doing it. That's just
[1:44:16] bunch of bozos.
[1:44:20] The big thing,
[1:44:24] the big thing is you cotton. The big
[1:44:27] thing is [snorts] that [music] boy right
[1:44:30] there. You're the big thing.
[1:44:39] You girls are the big thing.
[1:44:42] And God has seen [music] fit to bring
[1:44:44] you into this place
[1:44:49] because he's fixed to take us into a
[1:44:52] great
[1:44:53] This ain't [music] this ain't a lie.
[1:44:54] This ain't this ain't a fairy tale.
[1:44:59] There is another land that is
[1:45:02] greater than this. There's trees and
[1:45:05] birds,
[1:45:08] beautiful sky.
[1:45:13] There'll be no more sickness.
[1:45:18] There'll be no more little boys hoping
[1:45:21] to grow [music] up. You'll be grown.
[1:45:26] There ain't going to be no more grandpas
[1:45:27] and grandmas over there
[1:45:30] cuz you're going to be the same age of
[1:45:32] these as the young men.
[1:45:41] But today's the day
[1:45:44] that we want to take care of business,
[1:45:49] work for the master while we can. Can
[1:45:52] you [music] say amen?
[1:45:54] There is come
[1:45:57] many a day
[1:46:00] when no hard [music]
[1:46:03] break shall [singing] come.
[1:46:06] No more clouds
[1:46:10] in the sky.
[1:46:13] Tears
[1:46:15] to dim the eyes.
[1:46:18] All is [singing] peaceful.
[1:46:25] on that.
[1:46:28] [music]
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:46:31] what a day.
[1:46:34] Glorious [singing] day
[1:46:37] that will be.
[1:46:42] Oh, what a day
[1:46:45] [singing and music] that will be
[1:46:49] when my Jesus
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; When I look [singing]
[1:46:58] upon his face,
[1:47:00] the [music] one [singing] who save
[1:47:07] when he takes [singing] me by the hand,
[1:47:13] leads me through.
[1:47:19] What a [singing] day.
[1:47:22] Glorious day.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, there [singing and music] will be no
[1:47:34] sorrow left,
[1:47:37] no [music] more burdens.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; No more parting
[1:47:52] [music]
[1:47:54] [singing]
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; forever. I will be
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; with the one.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[1:48:09] [music]
[1:48:15] Oh,
[1:48:18] [singing]
[1:48:19] what a day.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Will my Jesus,
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[1:48:31] when I look, [singing]
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; the very one who saved me. [music]
[1:48:39] me by
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; when he [singing] takes
[1:48:45] me by the hand.
[1:48:49] me through
[1:48:51] the pro.
[1:48:56] [music]
[1:49:04] Brother Brennham would say with the
[1:49:05] weakness of no support of organization,
[1:49:09] no support of denominations, no support
[1:49:11] of ecclesiastical setup,
[1:49:14] but in simplicity and the power of the
[1:49:16] Holy Spirit that fell on Pentecost with
[1:49:18] the same message that Peter had on the
[1:49:20] day of Pentecost.
[1:49:22] Repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:49:24] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:49:26] remission of your sins.
[1:49:28] You won't be harnessed up like a bunch
[1:49:30] of those theologians with your collar
[1:49:33] turned around and a bachelor of art
[1:49:35] degrees.
[1:49:37] But brother, you'll have something in
[1:49:38] your hand.
[1:49:40] And long as the spirit of God will get
[1:49:42] into that word, it'll conquer and bring
[1:49:44] back those sheep, lost sheep that's gone
[1:49:46] astray. Amen.
[1:49:49] Confess our weaknesses. Throw off your
[1:49:51] doctrine of divinity. Throw off your
[1:49:53] knowit all, your membership. Strip
[1:49:56] yourself before God spiritually
[1:49:57] speaking. Call yourself unworthy.
[1:50:00] Then God can go to using you. Just don't
[1:50:03] say it from your mouth, but bring it
[1:50:05] from your heart.
[1:50:07] David, they had to strip. He had to
[1:50:09] strip [music] himself.
[1:50:13] He was the weakest among the whole
[1:50:14] crowd. Think
[1:50:17] of the maybe 10,000 or a 100,000
[1:50:20] soldiers on the hill.
[1:50:23] All of them trained. All of them with
[1:50:25] PhDs.
[1:50:28] Every one of them was spears. They were
[1:50:30] soldiers. Each one of them was corporal
[1:50:33] soando, private so and so.
[1:50:37] Even to the privates,
[1:50:39] general so and so, lieutenant so and so,
[1:50:41] great for star fourstar general saw
[1:50:44] bishop. Yes, your honor, sir. Every one
[1:50:47] of them standing there, trained men.
[1:50:50] And the enemy standing on the hill and
[1:50:52] said, "You bunch of cowards."
[1:50:58] That up come in the camp. Up in the camp
[1:51:01] come a little stoop shoulder. Oh god.
[1:51:05] Brother Brandham says
[1:51:08] up in the camp come a little stoop
[1:51:11] shoulder. Oh god. Little ruddy looking
[1:51:14] fella. little slingshot over his back
[1:51:17] with a raisin pie in his hand for
[1:51:19] [music] his brother.
[1:51:22] And that giant came out
[1:51:25] and made a cry once
[1:51:28] too often.
[1:51:39] that David with that shepherd's sling
[1:51:42] expressed to the whole Israelite army
[1:51:45] the faith he had in their God.
[1:51:49] Now there was a Goliath on the other
[1:51:50] side. He stood out there and made his
[1:51:52] boast many times bigger than David. He
[1:51:55] had fingers 14 in long. He was a mammoth
[1:51:58] big fella, the Philistine giant. Here
[1:52:01] was David, the smallest one. He was even
[1:52:05] too little to be in the army. Too much
[1:52:06] of a run. They they couldn't use him. So
[1:52:09] his brothers were out there in the army.
[1:52:12] Then Goliath made his boast. But [music]
[1:52:13] David, now remember, it was revealed to
[1:52:15] David. He was anointed. He It was
[1:52:18] revealed to David. He thought, "Here's
[1:52:20] the armies of the living God standing in
[1:52:22] their own land, and there's a boasting
[1:52:23] uncircumcised Philistine out there.
[1:52:26] We'll call him cancer tonight. We'll
[1:52:28] call him paralytic." Why? David was no
[1:52:30] match for him.
[1:52:32] Not of any kind of a weapon. He was no
[1:52:34] match. The man's probably standing
[1:52:39] [music] 14, 15 foot high, a spear like a
[1:52:42] weaver's needle, probably 20 foot long,
[1:52:49] the blade on it maybe 4 foot across, and
[1:52:51] a little David standing there [music]
[1:52:53] with a little piece of leather, goat
[1:52:56] skin or sheep skin with two pieces of
[1:52:58] string tied to it. But it was revealed
[1:53:01] to him. Revelation struck. Amen. He
[1:53:05] said, "The God that took me out of the
[1:53:07] paw of the bear, that took me out of the
[1:53:09] paws of the lion, how much more will he
[1:53:13] deliver this uncircumcised Philistine in
[1:53:15] my hand?"
[1:53:16] His brother is way more able to do it.
[1:53:18] Saul head and shoulders above his army.
[1:53:21] But you see, it wasn't revealed to them.
[1:53:23] There it is. They believed it could be
[1:53:25] done. They believed that God could do
[1:53:27] it, but it wasn't revealed to them. But
[1:53:30] it was revealed to David.
[1:53:32] There's the difference right there. If
[1:53:34] it's absolutely revealed to you that
[1:53:36] God's going to heal you, you're going to
[1:53:38] get it. You're going to get it. I don't
[1:53:41] care what's wrong with you. What's the
[1:53:43] odds? You may be worse than David and
[1:53:45] Goliath, but if it's revealed to you,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; notice when it's revealed, David become
[1:53:50] fearless. He said, "Today I'll cut your
[1:53:52] head off." Amen. quickly.
[1:53:55] Our God by grace in that crucial moment
[1:53:58] when the decision had to be made, that
[1:54:01] same God that produced the grace in that
[1:54:03] day and dropped that little seed of
[1:54:05] faith and that little hunchback looking
[1:54:06] boy, seeing in his heart, that same God
[1:54:10] [music] in this crucial moment could
[1:54:12] take that woman from the wheelchair,
[1:54:14] that man there, if you can believe it
[1:54:17] with all her trouble,
[1:54:20] then that little grain of faith is
[1:54:22] revealed.
[1:54:23] Can you say amen?
[1:54:26] I say today.
[1:54:31] Don't look at the big mountain
[1:54:36] because [music] this is the making of a
[1:54:38] big a big thing. This is a big thing.
[1:54:42] This is our day for deliverances. This
[1:54:43] is our day for the Holy Ghost. This is
[1:54:45] our day for boys and girls to enter into
[1:54:48] ministry.
[1:54:50] You say ministry?
[1:54:52] Yes.
[1:54:54] Ministry doesn't start
[1:54:57] when you're bald and gray like me.
[1:55:03] Ministry starts
[1:55:05] when you accept his spirit into your
[1:55:07] life and willing [music] to walk with
[1:55:09] him.
[1:55:11] His holy spirit will be right there and
[1:55:13] he'll be leading you and guiding you.
[1:55:17] Oh, glory to God.
[1:55:19] And then [music] this day, we're in our
[1:55:22] final day.
[1:55:24] And then he's going to catch us all home
[1:55:26] and we're going to have rewards.
[1:55:29] There will be no more sickness, no more
[1:55:31] sin, no more devil, no more temptation,
[1:55:34] no more mind battles. Hallelujah.
[1:55:40] And no more mirrors cuz we won't need
[1:55:42] them anymore. We'll be perfect.
[1:55:47] Hallelujah.
[1:55:50] Oh, what a day
[1:55:54] that [music]
[1:55:56] when my Jesus,
[1:56:03] when I look,
[1:56:08] the very one to [music] save me.
[1:56:14] When he takes
[1:56:17] me by the hand
[1:56:22] and leads me through the lamb.
[1:56:27] What a day. [singing and music]
[1:56:30] Glorious day.
[1:56:36] Bless the Lord. God bless you.
[1:56:40] [music]
[1:56:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:48] Sorry for messing up the New Mexican
[1:56:50] restaurant dinner date.
[1:56:53] Amen.
[1:57:03] But God's got something really special.
[1:57:09] Am I Am I as
[1:57:12] Are we all clear tonight?
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Where you're at right now, it's [music]
[1:57:18] you're either going to look through this
[1:57:19] closed book or you're going to look
[1:57:20] through this open book. And brother, if
[1:57:23] you see how the story ends and you see
[1:57:26] how what spirit is in our [music] age,
[1:57:28] brother, there there should be no
[1:57:30] defeatism.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; There should be no defeatism.
[1:57:37] It should be a day of great exploits.
[1:57:41] God bless you. Love you. Press the
[1:57:44] battle.
[1:57:45] Amen. Right now, right there, where you
[1:57:49] are, keep that sword in your hand. Don't
[1:57:52] you lay that sword down for nothing.
[1:57:54] Don't lay that sword [music] down for
[1:57:55] nothing.
[1:57:58] Young people, don't be looking to the
[1:57:59] right or the left. Keep your hearts
[1:58:01] pure. [music] Keep your hearts holy.
[1:58:02] Don't be looking out outside this this
[1:58:05] this message for boys [music] and girls,
[1:58:08] boyfriends, girlfriends. Do not get
[1:58:11] disillusioned [music] in any way. Stay
[1:58:14] the course.
[1:58:15] You're the main deal that's going
[1:58:18] [music] on in this land today. God's
[1:58:21] preparing you to go home. God bless you.
[1:58:24] God richly bless [music] you. Father, we
[1:58:26] thank you.
[1:58:28] Thank you for your divine grace. Thank
[1:58:30] you for your divine mercies.
[1:58:35] Thank you for this divine message.
[1:58:39] And Lord, we pray that the anointing of
[1:58:41] your Holy Spirit would take these words
[1:58:44] that I I ministered [music] here tonight
[1:58:47] and may it bless the people.
[1:58:51] May it be something that [music] they
[1:58:52] can think on.
[1:58:55] Lord, you see Brother Nathaniel and
[1:58:57] Sister Katrina are sick. And I pray Lord
[1:59:01] that your Holy Spirit would [music]
[1:59:03] heal them,
[1:59:06] Lord. That you would make them whole.
[1:59:08] Satan, you're a defeated foe
[1:59:11] and you are cursed in the name of
[1:59:13] [music] Jesus.
[1:59:17] Father, you see Aunt Angie and and Lord,
[1:59:21] that illness there, Lord, that's been
[1:59:23] bothering her. Father, I I Lord, I'm
[1:59:26] just speaking to that devil. You have no
[1:59:30] holds
[1:59:31] in the name of Jesus.
[1:59:34] Those that are in
[1:59:36] distress in their bodies, Lord, we are
[1:59:39] looking to you.
[1:59:41] We're believing you in the name of
[1:59:44] Jesus. We refuse despair. [music]
[1:59:47] We refuse to lay down our weapon.
[1:59:51] Father, I thank you [music] for it.
[1:59:54] I thank you for it,
[1:59:57] Lord Jesus.
[2:00:01] We want to give ourselves to you tonight
[2:00:06] these days of [music] small things.
[2:00:10] Maybe they're big mountains and maybe it
[2:00:12] might seem like
[2:00:14] you're so far away, but you're right
[2:00:16] there in that fiery furnace with us.
[2:00:18] Lord,
[2:00:21] we thank you for every miracle you are
[2:00:23] [music] performing and the great victory
[2:00:25] that will be wrought,
[2:00:28] we love you, Lord
[2:00:31] in the name of Jesus.
[2:00:34] Amen [music] and amen and amen.
[2:00:38] What a day
[2:00:41] that will be
[2:00:44] when my Jesus
[2:00:49] Oh, and [singing and music] I knew
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; the very one who saved me.
[2:00:59] [music]
[2:01:04] [music]
[2:01:08] leads me through.
[2:01:10] God bless you. We love every one of you.
[2:01:18] [music]
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; I have been hurting for quite a bit in
[2:01:23] my tailbone. I'm here to tell you I have
[2:01:26] suffered like I Oh, this has [music]
[2:01:30] been this has been rough.
[2:01:33] And I had a I had a really really rough
[2:01:36] day the other day.
[2:01:39] Sister Katrina
[2:01:41] [music] text me early one morning,
[2:01:45] yesterday morning.
[2:01:48] She said, "In the middle of the night,
[2:01:50] you were on my mind and the scripture
[2:01:52] came to me." And she shared the
[2:01:53] scripture, "Not one bone, not not one of
[2:01:57] his bones will be broken." speaking of
[2:01:59] Christ, not one of his bones will be
[2:02:01] broken.
[2:02:04] And she said, "I've been [music] praying
[2:02:05] for you for complete healing."
[2:02:09] Now, guys, you just don't know. You just
[2:02:11] don't. I'd never even imagine a tailbone
[2:02:13] could a broken tailbone could hurt like
[2:02:15] this.
[2:02:22] My there was no I I I was [music]
[2:02:26] sitting all day long yesterday and all
[2:02:29] day long today
[2:02:32] and brother I have not had no pain.
[2:02:36] I've not had pain. [applause]
[2:02:43] [applause]
[2:02:48] It was it was night and day. It was I
[2:02:51] went to bed and throughout the night
[2:02:53] hurting
[2:02:57] and I texted Katrina and I said, "You
[2:03:00] ain't gonna believe this."
[2:03:06] Might have been a small thing for her to
[2:03:08] pray.
[2:03:09] Might have been insignificant. Might
[2:03:11] have been a But God used [music] her
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; for me.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't God wonderful?
[2:03:22] when he takes
[2:03:24] me by the hand,
[2:03:27] leads me through. God bless you.
[2:03:31] We'll let you dismiss yourselves
[2:03:33] tonight.
[2:03:35] What a day, [singing] glorious day
[2:03:40] that will be.
[2:03:44] Oh, what a day
[2:03:48] that will be.
[2:03:50] When my Jesus
[2:03:54] I shall see.
[2:03:57] When it loo
[2:03:59] up on his face, [music]
