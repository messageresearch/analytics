[41:56] that's a promise that we have we've
[41:59] we've got such a message in this hour
[42:01] that has lifted us up you know brother
[42:03] Brandon I've been listening to the token
[42:06] and he would say we haven't come here to
[42:07] talk about it we've come here to get
[42:09] underneath it you know so we've got
[42:11] something we're grabbing we're applying
[42:12] it and it's picking us up oh my and it's
[42:15] carrying us all the way the wind that
[42:17] that the eagle needed was already in the
[42:19] sky all he had to do was relax and I say
[42:22] Lord help us to relax In The Presence of
[42:24] Jehovah and he would carry us all the
[42:26] way through amen if you have your Bibles
[42:28] this morning let's open our scriptures
[42:30] to Matthew 26 and
[42:33] 26 have a simple subject this morning
[42:37] but I pray you can be edifying and
[42:40] strengthen and encourage this morning
[42:42] you happen to be in the house of the
[42:43] Lord amen amen if you come to hear from
[42:46] the Lord this morning not from from a
[42:48] man if you come expecting to hear from a
[42:50] man you're going to be disappointed so
[42:52] and that's what's so incredible about
[42:54] the right expectation it don't matter
[42:56] who's preaching as long as we're
[42:58] expecting to hear from God God can meet
[43:00] the needs amen Matthew 26 and 26 the
[43:04] Bible says as they were eating Jesus
[43:06] Took bread and blessed it and break it
[43:09] and gave it to the disciples and said
[43:10] take eat this is my body he and he took
[43:13] the cup and gave thanks and gave it to
[43:15] them saying drink ye all of it for this
[43:18] is my blood of the new testament which
[43:20] is shed for many the remission of sins
[43:23] amen can we bow our heads this morning
[43:25] dear gracious Heavenly Father father
[43:28] Lord we're humbled by your presence this
[43:29] morning Father Lord as we felt you Lord
[43:33] come down and settle Among Us Lord I I I
[43:36] felt you as soon as I walked into the
[43:37] office this morning Lord as Sister Amy
[43:39] was singing Lord God I believe this is a
[43:41] special service Lord I don't believe any
[43:43] of us are here by accident father but
[43:46] Lord you pre-ordained us to be here
[43:48] father and you you pre-ordained a word
[43:50] to come this morning Lord to speak to
[43:52] the hearts and speak to the needs Lord
[43:54] God as a man we can only do so much
[43:57] father we can study and prepare Lord but
[43:59] it's only you that can speak to the
[44:01] needs Lord and break the yolks father
[44:04] Lord as we come to this part of the
[44:05] service Lord I lay myself aside father I
[44:07] surrender to you Lord and I ask that you
[44:09] would speak this morning Father I ask
[44:11] that you would anoint the congregation
[44:13] father may they get themselves aside as
[44:15] well Lord and receive what you have for
[44:17] them Father we ask these things in your
[44:19] precious name amen you may be seated
[44:23] this morning and if I had a subject I
[44:25] would like to speak on the life of the
[44:27] blood and brother brandom would tell us
[44:30] that we live off of dead substance he
[44:32] says naturally he says what we eat if
[44:35] you're going to eat of anything it's got
[44:36] to be dead you know and he says if you
[44:38] eat a hamburger the cow how to die if
[44:40] you eat bacon in the morning the pig how
[44:42] to die you know it says whatever you eat
[44:44] of and he says even the vegetarians it
[44:46] says if you eat a vegetable the
[44:47] vegetable had to die or the or if you
[44:49] drink milk the bacteria had to die he
[44:52] says we live off of dead dead substance
[44:54] and he says if we live naturally off of
[44:56] dead de substance we got to live now
[44:58] spiritually off of dead substance as
[45:01] well and he and through the Old
[45:02] Testament they we would see that they
[45:04] would come to the Tabernacle and they
[45:06] would slay a lamb and that lamb the
[45:08] blood of that lamb would sprinkle on
[45:09] them pour on them and it would cover
[45:12] them but there was no separation and
[45:14] even though they were forgiven there was
[45:16] no separation the Bible would tell us I
[45:18] believe in Leviticus that the blood
[45:20] would forgive but there was no
[45:22] separation there was no remission and so
[45:25] we see that whenever they would come and
[45:27] slay a lamb maybe if you if they had
[45:29] told a lie they would slay a lamb of the
[45:31] of the bull or the goat in that lamb the
[45:33] blood of it would pour upon them and it
[45:35] would forgive the lie but they would
[45:37] leave with the same desire to tell a lie
[45:40] and so it was a cycle of a lie a lie a
[45:42] lie they would be forgiven but there was
[45:44] no separation but we see here in Hebrews
[45:47] 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good
[45:50] things to come and not the very image of
[45:52] the things can never with those
[45:54] sacrifices which they offered year by
[45:56] year continually make comers there un to
[45:59] perfect but whenever Christ come he
[46:02] didn't just forgive he brought a
[46:04] remission and the word remission means
[46:06] to be separated released from prison or
[46:09] from bondage so when the blood of Christ
[46:11] come it didn't just forgive the
[46:13] worshipper but it would separate the
[46:15] worshipper whenever it would leave
[46:17] whenever you would leave the cross or
[46:19] whenever you would you would leave a
[46:21] church service you would go with a
[46:22] different desire you wouldn't be coming
[46:24] to church out of a cycle Lord forgive me
[46:27] for telling a lie Lord forgive me for
[46:29] doing this Lord forgive me for doing
[46:30] that cuz the Lord would forgive but we
[46:32] want to go from forgiveness to a
[46:35] remission and that's what the blood of
[46:37] Christ has done to us it has brought a
[46:39] remission a separation the Bible would
[46:41] tell us in Hebrews 10 and 17 and their
[46:44] sins and iniquities will I remember no
[46:47] more that's not just forgiveness that's
[46:49] a remission that's separated so when God
[46:51] looks at you he don't see sins he don't
[46:54] see failures he don't see mistakes when
[46:56] he look looks at you he sees the blood
[46:58] and brother Brandon would tell us that
[47:00] he don't even see you all he hears is
[47:02] your voice he says when he looks at you
[47:04] all he sees as your representation which
[47:07] is the blood and I think that is so
[47:09] incredible that we're represented by
[47:11] somebody perfect when we wasn't able to
[47:14] achieve Perfection when we wasn't able
[47:16] to get past our mistakes get past our
[47:18] failures there was a blood that would
[47:20] represent us and that would remove us
[47:22] and separate us from our mistakes and
[47:25] brother Brandon would tell us consider
[47:27] this since it is the blood of God it is
[47:29] a perfect blood and the perfect blood is
[47:32] loosening us from the power and bondage
[47:34] and defilement of sin then the loosening
[47:37] is perfect and complete there was now no
[47:40] therefore there was now therefore no
[47:42] condemnation who shall lay anything to
[47:44] the charge of God's elect is a God that
[47:46] justifieth declares us righteous who is
[47:49] he that condemneth is a Christ that died
[47:52] there it is he gave us the blood and the
[47:54] blood has loosed us and there was now no
[47:57] condemnation How can there be there was
[47:59] nothing to condemn for because the blood
[48:02] has loosed us from sin we are free
[48:04] Guiltless don't listen to the man listen
[48:07] to the word you were loosed by the blood
[48:10] and I say we can put that more than just
[48:12] a man don't listen to condemnation don't
[48:15] listen to complexes don't listen to
[48:17] other voices that says you're not
[48:19] separated but listen to the blood that
[48:22] says you were loosed a perfect loosening
[48:25] and we see that since the blood is is
[48:27] perfect we are perfect and I now I'm no
[48:29] longer known by my own nature but the
[48:31] man I used to be has taken has taken
[48:34] play has been separated and there's a
[48:36] new man that has come on the inside and
[48:39] I like how the Bible would put it in
[48:40] Hebrews 10:2 for then when they have not
[48:43] ceased to be offered because that the
[48:45] worshipper once purged should not should
[48:48] have no Cal more conscience of sins and
[48:51] so it's no longer a cycle but once you
[48:53] are purged the conscience of sin is you
[48:57] see the conscience of sin wasn't gone
[48:59] under the blood of bulls and goats but
[49:01] once the blood of Christ come the
[49:03] conscience of it was gone the desire of
[49:05] it was gone and so we see that it wasn't
[49:08] the literal blood of Jesus but the life
[49:10] of the blood that would bring the
[49:12] remission because if you fail to see the
[49:14] life of the blood all you have is a for
[49:17] because if it's the natural blood of
[49:19] Jesus that you're looking for it's not
[49:21] here we don't got the natural blood of
[49:23] Jesus but we do got the life of the
[49:25] blood which is the Holy Ghost and you
[49:27] see that's what I love about the message
[49:30] is it's brought us out of a form of
[49:32] Creeds and ideas and traditions and has
[49:34] brought us into a reality and we're not
[49:37] we're thankful for the cross but what
[49:39] did the cross do for me I'm thankful for
[49:41] the blood but what did the blood do for
[49:43] me and the message will let us know that
[49:46] the cross is more than a crucifix the
[49:48] blood is more than just a chemical but
[49:51] the cross and the blood is was the
[49:53] releasing of God and brother Brandon
[49:55] would tell us whenever he was on the
[49:56] cross the blood shell when it was broke
[49:59] it released God and so the blood is more
[50:02] than just a chemical but it's the life
[50:04] it's deity coming inside of humanity to
[50:08] bring a separation where we have no more
[50:11] conscience of sin where we can come the
[50:13] church out of a pure mind knowing that
[50:16] I'm not going to come next week asking
[50:18] for forgiveness of the same things of
[50:20] last week but there's a separation
[50:23] there's a Deliverance there's a liberty
[50:25] that was taking place place and we would
[50:27] see brother brandom he would tell us
[50:30] that God would show his longsuffering
[50:32] and kindness to pharaoh and to the
[50:34] people of Egypt and and in in the token
[50:37] he would say that that it was his it was
[50:39] God's longsuffering to pharaoh and he
[50:41] sent a prophet he would show him the
[50:43] signs he would show him the pillar of
[50:45] fire you see behind the signs was a
[50:48] message and the message was let my
[50:50] people go but you see brother the
[50:52] Brandon would say they would not repent
[50:54] they ignored all of his signs ignored
[50:56] his prophet and his message so now God
[50:59] was making a separation and what would
[51:02] make the separation was the token and we
[51:05] would see that God would require a lamb
[51:07] to be slain and he didn't say put the
[51:09] lamb above above the doorpost he said
[51:12] put the blood above the doorpost in
[51:15] other words you can listen to the
[51:16] message but you got to get the life of
[51:18] the message you we're not going to be
[51:20] raptured because of a tape player we're
[51:22] being raptured because there's a life
[51:24] that has been brought and brother
[51:25] Brandon would tell us that if you didn't
[51:28] apply the life of it if you didn't reply
[51:30] the blood then you was not you was not
[51:32] under the token and brother Brandon
[51:34] would tell us that's what he's requiring
[51:36] that night to separate the Believers
[51:38] from the believer or the unbelievers
[51:40] from the believer the believer the
[51:42] worshipper was identified with the
[51:44] sacrifice he must apply the blood it
[51:47] wasn't and take the lamb and set the
[51:49] blood out there somewhere or keep it in
[51:51] a charger or take it down to the
[51:53] neighbors he had to apply the blood and
[51:56] we see that whenever the Judgment would
[51:58] be passing would be passing through the
[52:00] city they would be hearing the screams
[52:02] of this one dying of that one dying they
[52:05] could rest assured that there was a
[52:07] separation that had separated them there
[52:10] was a remission a separation from the
[52:13] Judgment that even though there was a
[52:15] judgment coming by their house they
[52:17] could rest assure that none of the
[52:19] spirits none of the plagues that was
[52:22] coming against the city would come
[52:24] against them cuz we know the plagues of
[52:26] Egypt eypt was not for the Israelites it
[52:29] was for the Egyptians and the same thing
[52:31] today we've had 200,000,000 demons that
[52:34] has been lifted out has been brought in
[52:36] this generation but we see that it's not
[52:38] for you it's for the world the evil
[52:41] spirits that is plaguing the minds
[52:43] plaguing the world plaguing the hearts
[52:45] is not for you but it's for the world
[52:48] but what separates you from the world
[52:50] and from the judgment is there's a life
[52:52] behind the blood that has brought us
[52:55] separation and brother brand will tell
[52:57] us that the token today is the Holy
[52:59] Ghost and we see that the blood will do
[53:01] no good for you unless it is applied and
[53:04] we would see that they would have to
[53:06] apply the blood with hisp and brother
[53:08] Brandon would say the hisp wasn't
[53:10] anything special it was just common
[53:12] weeds that was that that was around that
[53:14] area so they would take that his up that
[53:16] plain thing and would apply the blood
[53:19] and brother Brandon would say you was
[53:21] symbolizing that it's faith that applies
[53:23] the blood today it's not something it's
[53:26] not something uh something big it's
[53:28] something common and no my we're living
[53:30] in the day where the world is looking
[53:32] for something big to bring certainty
[53:35] they think a new president will help or
[53:37] or more money will help or this here is
[53:39] going to help and they fail to realize
[53:42] that right among them there's a common
[53:44] faith that has been restored in this
[53:47] generation that we can apply the token
[53:50] and it will separate us from the
[53:52] Judgment that is coming upon the Earth
[53:55] and we would see that that it's faith
[53:57] that would apply the token so while the
[53:59] world is fearing we're living in a peace
[54:01] while the world is panicking we have a
[54:04] sound of mind it's something so common
[54:07] but it's brought us separation and
[54:09] brother Brandon would preach the token
[54:11] and would tell us that the ticket is the
[54:13] price that has been prid that has been
[54:15] paid he would talk about the box car or
[54:17] if you if you would fly or whatever it
[54:19] is you can't bring the money to the
[54:21] ticket or to the to the uh to the gates
[54:24] you had to bring the token and you know
[54:26] and whenever you would fly you get to
[54:28] show them your ticket I don't know if
[54:30] any how many's ever has flown before but
[54:32] that proves that the price is paid and
[54:35] so first you before you can get the
[54:37] token there's got to be a purchase made
[54:40] for the token but once it's purchased
[54:43] then you got to go and check in you know
[54:45] I don't know how many's ever flown
[54:46] before you know before you ever go to
[54:48] the airport you buy a ticket right and
[54:50] then you get to the airport you don't go
[54:52] to security you don't go to you don't go
[54:54] to your gate you go to the counter and
[54:57] you apply the purchase right you go and
[54:59] you check in and say hey I'm Josh Martin
[55:02] there's a purchase ticket for me and now
[55:04] I'm wanting the token and you see that's
[55:06] what it is when you apply the Holy Ghost
[55:08] the blood has purchased your separation
[55:10] but you got to apply it somebody's got
[55:13] to go and identify it and say hey it's
[55:15] been bought for me but I want to
[55:18] identify it but you notice that after
[55:21] after you check in and you get your
[55:23] token now you're eligible to go through
[55:25] security
[55:26] you're eligible to go through customs
[55:29] you're eligible to go through all of the
[55:31] next steps because you are identified
[55:34] with the purchase and the Holy Ghost
[55:36] makes you eligible for the supernatural
[55:39] you see brother Brandon will tell us
[55:40] you're not even off first base without
[55:42] the Holy Ghost but once you get the Holy
[55:45] Ghost it identifies you with everything
[55:48] that the blood has purchased for you oh
[55:50] my you see this message has let us know
[55:53] that the blood has brought our
[55:54] Redemption it has brought salvation it
[55:57] has brought a sound of mind it's paid
[55:59] the price for deliverance it's paid the
[56:01] price for lost loved ones but the Holy
[56:04] Ghost identifies you and lets you know
[56:07] what the blood bot is yours it's not for
[56:10] your neighbor it's not for so and so but
[56:12] this purchase is for you and then that
[56:15] put you in a position and brother
[56:17] Brandon would tell us that whenever you
[56:19] go and pray he says put the token before
[56:21] you he says when you would go and pray
[56:23] Shake That token before the devil and
[56:26] you can't keep me from it because he may
[56:28] battle your mind he may battle your body
[56:30] he may battle you but there's one thing
[56:33] he cannot take away that is the
[56:35] identification of the token and you see
[56:38] that Egypt the literal blood of the Lamb
[56:40] was the token but brother Brandon would
[56:42] say that the chemical blood of Jesus is
[56:45] not the token it is the Holy Ghost and
[56:48] he would tell us that there's a
[56:49] difference between the blood and the
[56:52] life and it's pretty incredible because
[56:54] he would tell us that the life life
[56:56] would come and create a blood cell and
[56:58] that blood cell would create another
[57:00] cell it would create another cell in the
[57:02] womb of Mary and then there would come
[57:04] Jesus he says it was the man Jesus
[57:06] Christ which was God and he says but
[57:09] whenever he was on the cross he says the
[57:11] chemical blood went back to its natural
[57:14] elements he went back it went to the
[57:16] ground maybe Jesus ate some ate some
[57:18] weed or ate some ate some fruit and he
[57:21] says the blood went back to the natural
[57:23] elements but the life went to the church
[57:26] and so we don't got the natural blood of
[57:28] Jesus but we got the literal life of
[57:31] Jesus brother Brandon would tell us he
[57:33] says if we if I had a charger of two
[57:35] drops of the blood of Jesus he says oh
[57:37] how I would walk so humbly I would walk
[57:40] walk so carefully because I have the
[57:42] literal blood of Jesus but he says now
[57:44] I'm standing before the purchased of the
[57:46] blood of Jesus and he says that is
[57:48] greater than the literal blood oh my if
[57:51] you ever realize what the blood has done
[57:53] for you the blood has broke the has him
[57:56] and has created a highway where you can
[57:59] come back to the come back to the throne
[58:01] of God and come on talking terms and say
[58:05] Satan get out of my family get out of my
[58:07] mind get out of my marriage you see it's
[58:10] somebody that knows who they are their
[58:12] identification has identified them with
[58:15] what the blood has purchased oh my
[58:18] brother the Brandon would say and being
[58:19] man and God being manifested in the
[58:21] flesh with Jesus Jesus the anointed WRA
[58:24] himself in a blood cell oh my in the
[58:27] womb of Mary brought forth his life he
[58:29] lived and he lived a man he died a man
[58:32] to give us blood and though his body and
[58:34] the shedding and through his body and
[58:36] the shedding of his blood that every
[58:39] believer could be wrapped in that blood
[58:41] shell with him which if which if a man a
[58:45] born again Spirit of a man is wrapped in
[58:47] the blood shell of the Son of God God
[58:50] can no more deny you than he can deny
[58:53] himself for by one Spirit we're all
[58:55] baptized into one body and become
[58:57] partakers of The Same Spirit that's in
[58:59] that blood cell and the church is
[59:01] wrapped into the blood cell of the life
[59:04] of Jesus Christ oh I like how we put
[59:06] that not just the blood cell but the
[59:08] blood cell of the life of Jesus Christ
[59:11] and other words just that Christ was
[59:13] perfect in this blood cell the life of
[59:16] this blood cell you are perfect there's
[59:18] a separation where there's not even a
[59:20] condemnation that can come against your
[59:23] mind if the blood is applied you see too
[59:25] many people fail to apply the blood
[59:28] which is the Holy Ghost and they're
[59:30] trying to be a good Christian they're
[59:31] trying to live a good life they're
[59:33] trying to be an overcomer but all you
[59:35] have to do is apply the blood and that
[59:38] brings uing and you get into this blood
[59:41] cell with Jesus Christ and you are
[59:43] therefore perfect even as our father in
[59:46] Heaven is perfect how can we be perfect
[59:49] with a Josh in a day where there's
[59:51] lesbians there's homosexuals there's
[59:53] pornography there's drugs there's
[59:54] alcohol where living in a day where the
[59:57] blood brother Brandon would say the
[59:59] token couldn't even be applied till the
[1:00:01] evening time we're living in the day
[1:00:03] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[1:00:05] Holy Ghost was bared by denominational
[1:00:07] Rivers right for 2,000 years but is to
[1:00:10] be loosed by an evening time message so
[1:00:13] we're living in the day where all of
[1:00:15] Heaven has been poured out to the
[1:00:17] believer that even though the we're in
[1:00:19] sat and heeden there's another life that
[1:00:22] is on the inside of the believer that
[1:00:24] can defy every obstacle that can defy
[1:00:27] every spirit that speaks against you oh
[1:00:31] my we've been made eligible with the
[1:00:33] Supernatural and so it's the token that
[1:00:36] connects you with the purchase and
[1:00:38] brother Brandon would say listen close
[1:00:40] while I make these closing remarks if
[1:00:42] Satan tries to tries to hand you some of
[1:00:44] his stuff like sickness you know what to
[1:00:47] do just show him the token and say I'm a
[1:00:49] purchased product my healing has been
[1:00:52] paid for I'm a product of God because I
[1:00:55] have a token the Holy Ghost you cannot
[1:00:58] keep me off of this highway you cannot
[1:01:01] keep me from my health I present the
[1:01:03] token and show you that by his stripes I
[1:01:06] was healed here is the resurrection of
[1:01:09] Jesus Christ right in me now to prove to
[1:01:12] you oh there is a real thing there is
[1:01:15] the token oh I like how he says that
[1:01:17] there is a real thing there is a token
[1:01:20] while the church has something in their
[1:01:22] imagination they've got Sensations
[1:01:24] they've got goosebumps they've got all
[1:01:26] these other things there is a real thing
[1:01:28] that the bride of Christ has it is the
[1:01:30] literal life on the inside of them that
[1:01:33] is brought a separation oh hallelujah
[1:01:36] it's bright of Separation while the
[1:01:38] world is in cycle the church members in
[1:01:40] a cycle there's been a separation that
[1:01:43] has called you out of the cycle and has
[1:01:45] placed you upon a highway that has taken
[1:01:49] you all the way to the Rapture you know
[1:01:51] what the Brandon would say that Enoch
[1:01:53] when he got up that last morning he
[1:01:55] didn't take his regular path He Walked
[1:01:57] on God's Highway oh my what is zoch he
[1:02:00] is your type that is the same Highway
[1:02:03] that you were walking on today and you
[1:02:05] can't beat your type if this highway LED
[1:02:07] Enoch all the way to his Rapture want
[1:02:10] about you today we're walking on the
[1:02:12] same Highway where there's no spirits
[1:02:14] that can condemn you there's no voices
[1:02:16] of the enemy that can pull you down
[1:02:18] we're walking on the King's Highway that
[1:02:21] has taken us all the way to the coming
[1:02:24] of the Lord oh Hallelujah I'm purchased
[1:02:27] that means your health is purchased and
[1:02:29] the Bible would tell us in Proverbs 16
[1:02:32] and 17 the highway of the upright is to
[1:02:35] depart from Evil and he that keepeth his
[1:02:37] way preserveth his soul oh my the way
[1:02:41] the highway of the upright is to depart
[1:02:44] in other words it's to separate there's
[1:02:46] a remission so on this on this highway
[1:02:50] the only ones that can walk on it is the
[1:02:52] ones that is separated from the voice of
[1:02:55] the enemy enemy is the one that is
[1:02:57] separated and under the remission of
[1:03:00] their sins oh my but brand would say
[1:03:02] that's the way real Christianity is a
[1:03:04] living experience Pentecost is not a
[1:03:07] denomination Pentecost is an experience
[1:03:10] that anybody can have if they wish to
[1:03:13] have it's something you can experience
[1:03:15] the Holy Spirit oh my Christianity is
[1:03:19] more than reading the Bible it's more
[1:03:20] than praying a prayer it's more than
[1:03:22] saying Hell mares it's more than just
[1:03:24] listening to a tape Christian chity is a
[1:03:26] living experience and he says you can
[1:03:29] have it if you want it oh too many times
[1:03:32] we are we're so we're so full on the
[1:03:35] things of the world that we don't got no
[1:03:37] appetite for the Holy Ghost we're so
[1:03:39] full on Theology and man's ideas that
[1:03:42] we've got no appetite for the Holy Ghost
[1:03:44] but there's a real living experience
[1:03:46] that can come and change the nature of a
[1:03:49] young boy that can change the nature of
[1:03:51] an adult that can change the nature and
[1:03:53] bring a separation oh my you may say
[1:03:56] Josh I've been in this message 50 years
[1:03:58] maybe you've got the Holy Ghost but
[1:03:59] you've allowed some things to come back
[1:04:01] in your life you need a separation we're
[1:04:04] never too old for a refilling of the
[1:04:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm preaching
[1:04:08] now we're never too old we're never in
[1:04:10] this message too long to get a renewing
[1:04:13] we never we never know too much to get a
[1:04:15] renewing oh Hallelujah it don't matter
[1:04:18] how much we know how much we learn we
[1:04:20] still need to be separated from the
[1:04:23] things that the world becomes inside of
[1:04:25] our mind mind comes inside of our body
[1:04:27] you see what the brand was said the
[1:04:29] Bible said he ascended on high and gave
[1:04:32] gifts unto men there was an atmosphere
[1:04:35] that hung over the Earth of Darkness of
[1:04:37] Gloom and of death and and of weariness
[1:04:39] the prayers couldn't come up because the
[1:04:42] atonement wasn't made but he broke
[1:04:44] through the veil he opened up the way he
[1:04:47] broke the veil of sickness he broke the
[1:04:49] veil of sin he broke the veil of
[1:04:51] weariness he broke the veil of
[1:04:53] depression he broke every Veil and made
[1:04:56] a highway for the wayfaring Men Walking
[1:04:59] Up The King's Highway oh you know what
[1:05:02] that means that the blood is more than
[1:05:04] just something in our imagination the
[1:05:06] blood is your deliverance the blood is
[1:05:08] your rapture the blood is your
[1:05:10] sanctification the blood is the freedom
[1:05:12] from condemnation he broke every Veil
[1:05:15] and put a highway into existence that
[1:05:18] would go over the CM you know brother
[1:05:20] the Brandon would tell us that when man
[1:05:22] fell from the be in the beginning that
[1:05:24] there was a Chasm that kept man from God
[1:05:27] and so this highway that the blood
[1:05:29] purchased it goes over the chasm where
[1:05:32] you can walk back to the throne of God
[1:05:35] with boldness that we can come before
[1:05:37] the presence of God and say Lord I'm
[1:05:39] having problems in my marriage I'm
[1:05:41] having problems with my teenagers I'm
[1:05:43] having problems and the blood has
[1:05:45] identified you that your prayers ain't
[1:05:47] being stopped by condemnation your
[1:05:49] prayers ain't being stopped by a by a
[1:05:51] broken Spirit your prayers ain't being
[1:05:53] stopped by complexes but every veil has
[1:05:57] been rined and that prayer take you
[1:05:59] straight to the throne room of God where
[1:06:02] you can speak to Papa God and he speaks
[1:06:05] back to you oh that's what we need today
[1:06:07] is somebody that is on talking terms
[1:06:10] with Papa God that can get into a prayer
[1:06:12] closet somewhere and say Lord I'm
[1:06:14] getting past the pressure I'm getting
[1:06:16] past the Mind battles I'm getting past
[1:06:18] these things I'm I'm going to apply the
[1:06:20] blood over my children I'm applying the
[1:06:23] blood over my household I'm applying the
[1:06:25] blood it's somebody that is on talking
[1:06:28] terms but we see that the token
[1:06:30] identified you with the Redemptive
[1:06:32] rights of calary and whether the Brandon
[1:06:34] would say many people don't believe this
[1:06:37] is because the token hasn't been applied
[1:06:40] and he would say this here uhh he would
[1:06:42] say uh uh uh and he says uh you cannot
[1:06:45] keep me from my health I present the
[1:06:47] token and show you by your stripes I was
[1:06:49] healed here is the resurrection of Jesus
[1:06:52] Christ right in me to prove to you oh
[1:06:54] there was a real thing there is the
[1:06:56] token that's the reason people don't
[1:06:58] believe it that's the reason it's hard
[1:07:00] for them to see it the token has never
[1:07:03] been applied so that is the reason they
[1:07:05] say all the days of Miracles is passed
[1:07:09] and so that's the reason we fail to see
[1:07:11] the supernatural many times is we fail
[1:07:13] to be identified with what the
[1:07:16] Supernatural is and you see you know I
[1:07:19] went to England uh a couple years ago
[1:07:21] and uh we had a layover in Paris and you
[1:07:24] know and it was AG ating because we had
[1:07:26] a ticket me and brother Andrew had a
[1:07:28] ticket that had brought us this far into
[1:07:30] the journey it had brought us through
[1:07:32] the Customs it brought us through
[1:07:33] security it brought it has brought us
[1:07:36] all the way it brought us to our gate
[1:07:38] you know and I guess there in Paris they
[1:07:40] don't like Americans and I man they were
[1:07:43] so rude to us you know and so we get
[1:07:45] there to our gate there they got the
[1:07:47] boarding calls you know me and brother
[1:07:48] Andrew get up to the gate and we give
[1:07:50] him a ticket they said no you don't got
[1:07:51] a ticket and we said yeah we got a
[1:07:53] ticket right here they said no you don't
[1:07:55] got one we said we got a ticket right
[1:07:57] here they said no you don't got one next
[1:07:59] and here they canceled our ticket here
[1:08:01] we got a purchased product we have the
[1:08:03] token showing that the purchase was made
[1:08:07] and now I'm identified to get on that
[1:08:09] plane but what they done was they had
[1:08:12] cancelled my token and now they expected
[1:08:15] me to get to my destination with help of
[1:08:17] token and oh my too many times we get
[1:08:19] wet blankets in the house of God that is
[1:08:22] trying to cancel the Holy Ghost and they
[1:08:25] expect their children to be saved they
[1:08:27] expect their teenagers to get filled
[1:08:29] with the Holy Ghost and they set there
[1:08:30] trying to cancel and bind up the Holy
[1:08:33] Ghost but let me say this if you loose
[1:08:35] the Holy Ghost and actually get into a
[1:08:37] service and say Lord move for my
[1:08:39] children move for my loved ones move for
[1:08:42] my daughter move for my son you might
[1:08:44] actually see a Revival but too many

[1:12:17] they get rebellious if you're putting
[1:12:19] them in an environment that they're
[1:12:20] soaking up bitterness they're soaking up
[1:12:22] gossip they're soaking up criticalness
[1:12:24] I'm preaching this morning and what it
[1:12:26] is was I was putting that sponge inside
[1:12:29] of an environment it wasn't the sponge's
[1:12:31] fault it was my fault and in order for
[1:12:34] the sponge to have a Revival I had to
[1:12:37] throw out that environment and rinse it
[1:12:39] out a little bit and put some clean
[1:12:41] water in there and you notice that I had
[1:12:43] to dump out that water every few little
[1:12:45] every few Washings I had to dump the
[1:12:47] water out get some more water you see
[1:12:49] sometimes that's what it takes for a
[1:12:51] Revival to come inside of a home is Lord
[1:12:54] I'm reconsecration myself not just today
[1:12:56] but however long it takes I'm throwing
[1:12:59] up the criticalness you know it's
[1:13:01] criticalness that can bind up the Holy
[1:13:03] Ghost for your children it's
[1:13:04] criticalness that can bind up if that's
[1:13:07] all they're hearing what do you expect
[1:13:09] could you imagine if if somebody comes
[1:13:12] to you and it's saying hey so and so did
[1:13:14] this so and so done that this person
[1:13:16] done that and then you say hey so and so
[1:13:19] can you go talk to my daughter cuz she's
[1:13:21] needing help you think your daughter is
[1:13:23] going to listen to so and so and after
[1:13:25] you just tore them down come on now too
[1:13:27] many times we do that we're talking
[1:13:29] about this one we're criticizing this
[1:13:31] one oh man this one I oh across the
[1:13:33] country they do it this way across the
[1:13:35] country they do it that way what you're
[1:13:37] doing is binding up a Revival that can
[1:13:40] release your children from the
[1:13:42] defilement of sin I say let's take our
[1:13:45] buckets this morning let's take our
[1:13:46] atmospheres and throw it out let's take
[1:13:49] our environments and throw it out and
[1:13:51] say Lord give me the life of the blood
[1:13:53] if I need to throw some things out I'm
[1:13:56] going to throw it out if I got to stop
[1:13:58] being critical I'm going to stop it I
[1:14:01] want a Revival inside of my
[1:14:05] life oh somebody's got to get a Revival
[1:14:08] oh it's the life of the blood it's the
[1:14:11] life brother the random says how are you
[1:14:12] going to have a Revival of the Holy
[1:14:14] Ghost and people quench it and bind it
[1:14:17] and afraid of it that's where the
[1:14:19] trouble lies oh that's where the trouble
[1:14:22] Lies when they're trying to quench the
[1:14:24] Holy Ghost
[1:14:25] oh this is okay this morning this is
[1:14:27] something that's been on my heart and I
[1:14:28] haven't just preached it here I preached
[1:14:30] it out too you see some people are
[1:14:32] getting them to they're getting afraid
[1:14:34] of letting loose brother Brandon would
[1:14:35] say the blood was a token or
[1:14:38] identification that the blood identified
[1:14:41] that the worshipper had slain the lamb
[1:14:43] and accepted the lamb and applied the
[1:14:46] token to himself that he was not ashamed
[1:14:50] he didn't care who saw it he wanted
[1:14:52] everybody to see it and the play with
[1:14:54] the was placed in such a position that
[1:14:57] everybody passing by could see the
[1:15:01] token he wasn't ashamed of it he wanted
[1:15:04] everybody to see the token oh my that
[1:15:07] should be your attitudes I wanted
[1:15:09] everybody to see that the Holy Ghost is
[1:15:11] moving in my
[1:15:13] church come on now I want everybody to
[1:15:16] say that we're not dead church members
[1:15:18] now I'm not talking about going and
[1:15:19] being fanatical and doing these things
[1:15:21] but there is a true token there is a
[1:15:23] true Holy Ghost that can take the
[1:15:25] starchiness and take and and and make a
[1:15:28] separation you see brother the Brandon
[1:15:30] would say this there's been much mockery
[1:15:32] in in every phase of religion but there
[1:15:35] is a real power of the holy spirit that
[1:15:37] delivers the human being from the
[1:15:39] bondage of sin there's a real power of
[1:15:42] the holy spirit that delivers the
[1:15:44] sufferer from his suffering there is a
[1:15:47] real Holy Spirit but the brandom said
[1:15:50] there that there's many mockeries out
[1:15:52] there but that don't take away that
[1:15:54] there is still something genuine come on
[1:15:57] now you might be afraid saying well we
[1:15:58] see what this person's doing we see what
[1:16:00] that church is doing it might be a moery
[1:16:03] but that doesn't mean there's not a real
[1:16:04] thing there can't be a moery unless
[1:16:07] there's a real thing right you can't be
[1:16:09] a counterfeit $5 bill if there's no real
[1:16:11] $5 bill right you've never seen a
[1:16:14] counterfeit $9 bill right cuz there's
[1:16:16] not one out there but there are
[1:16:18] counterfeits off of the genuine so if
[1:16:20] there's a marree of the Holy Ghost that
[1:16:23] means there's a genuine holy ghost that
[1:16:26] the church can have there's a genuine
[1:16:29] Revival that can come on the inside you
[1:16:32] know what I say to do let's start
[1:16:33] digging ditches I say let's let's start
[1:16:36] digging ditches you know the prophet
[1:16:37] under inspiration there in Second Kings
[1:16:40] would say we're not going to hear no
[1:16:41] Thunder we're not going to see no rain
[1:16:44] but you dig ditches and you get up the
[1:16:46] next morning and there's going to be
[1:16:47] water you might not know how it's going
[1:16:49] to happen but I say let's dig ditches we
[1:16:52] might not know how the Next Generation
[1:16:54] is going to make a Rapture but let's dig
[1:16:56] ditches we might not know how my
[1:16:58] rebellious teenager is going to be set
[1:17:01] free but I'm making preparations I know
[1:17:04] that the same holy ghost that set me a
[1:17:06] fire is the same holy ghost that can get
[1:17:09] a hold of their life let's start digging
[1:17:11] ditches you know what happens when you
[1:17:13] dig a ditch you got to get the dirt out
[1:17:15] you got to get it out I'm sure the water
[1:17:17] was already there but the dirt was
[1:17:20] covering up the water oh when your
[1:17:21] Revival is already there but the
[1:17:24] criticalness can bury up your Revival
[1:17:26] bitterness can bury up the Revival but
[1:17:28] as you start to dig the ditches you're
[1:17:30] you're you're released on the Holy Ghost
[1:17:33] the come inside of a family the come
[1:17:36] inside of a church oh Hallelujah but you
[1:17:40] see when you're expecting something to
[1:17:42] happen you make preparations for it and
[1:17:44] we see that that how come it's in the
[1:17:47] evening time that the devil has fought
[1:17:49] so hard against the Holy Ghost we're
[1:17:51] living in the day where the Holy Ghost
[1:17:53] you know man we can't do this this we
[1:17:55] can't do that there's so many there's
[1:17:57] intellectual Devils intellectual spirits
[1:17:59] that is trying to bind it up how come
[1:18:01] cuz brother Brandon would say this the
[1:18:03] lamb was killed in the evening time
[1:18:05] after being kept for 14 days and the
[1:18:08] lamb was killed and the blood was
[1:18:10] applied in the evening time he says you
[1:18:13] get it so it's the holy ghost that
[1:18:15] identifies you with the purchase of the
[1:18:18] blood and we would see that we're living
[1:18:20] in the day where the open book has been
[1:18:23] given to us and what was inside of the
[1:18:25] open book was your Redemption right it
[1:18:28] was your Redemption claims it was your
[1:18:30] the right for a Rapture it was your
[1:18:32] right for the Holy Ghost it was your
[1:18:34] right forever redempt the promise of God
[1:18:36] but it's applying the blood that
[1:18:39] identifies you with what this message
[1:18:41] has brought so without the Holy Ghost
[1:18:44] the the the this message is still a
[1:18:46] closed book but with the Holy Ghost the
[1:18:49] message is more than tapes more than
[1:18:51] quotes but it's my Redemption so that's
[1:18:54] why the devil is fighting so hard
[1:18:57] against the Holy Ghost because he knows
[1:18:59] if he can keep you from the Holy Ghost
[1:19:01] he's keeping you from your Redemptive
[1:19:04] claims from your Redemptive rights
[1:19:06] that's why the Holy Ghost is so
[1:19:08] important today it don't matter what
[1:19:11] comes against it we need the Holy Ghost
[1:19:13] today cuz we would see that the Bible
[1:19:16] would tell us that the blood of Jesus
[1:19:18] speaks better things than that of Abel
[1:19:21] cuz we know that Abel his blood spoke
[1:19:23] condemnation right cuz it was it was God
[1:19:25] that would come to Cain and would say
[1:19:27] where's your brother you know and he
[1:19:29] would say am I my am I My Brother's
[1:19:30] Keeper and he would say well his blood
[1:19:32] cries against you and so it was the
[1:19:34] blood of Cain it was the blood of Abel
[1:19:37] that spoke condemnation but we would see
[1:19:40] that it's the blood of Jesus that speaks
[1:19:42] of redemption it's not speaking
[1:19:45] condemnation it's speaking Redemption
[1:19:47] and so brother Brandon would say this
[1:19:49] here Paul tells us talking about
[1:19:51] speaking of the blood Paul said Paul
[1:19:53] tells us the the blood speaks you
[1:19:56] believe the blood speaks in Genesis 4:1
[1:19:58] or 410 God told Cain he says where is
[1:20:01] your brother he says his blood the blood
[1:20:04] is the voice of his blood calls out
[1:20:06] against you now we also find in Hebrews
[1:20:09] the 12th chapter the 24th verse that the
[1:20:12] New Testament the blood speaks better
[1:20:14] things the blood is speaking then the
[1:20:17] blood has got a voice and the voice of
[1:20:19] the blood is the word oh my so if the
[1:20:23] blood is speaking that means it's the
[1:20:26] word and so the life of the blood
[1:20:28] connects you to the voice of the blood
[1:20:31] and that brings Redemption inside of
[1:20:34] Fallen Humanity that's why the devil is
[1:20:37] fighting so hard for you to get the Holy
[1:20:39] Ghost brother the brand would say this
[1:20:41] the life that is in you speaks from the
[1:20:44] shed blood oh my oh brother I wish
[1:20:46] everybody could see that if you can see
[1:20:48] what it is it's the life that is in you
[1:20:51] see the blood is identifying you with it
[1:20:54] it's the token what is the blood shed
[1:20:57] for shed for you you've accepted it and
[1:21:00] the life has come into you you have the
[1:21:03] token he says the blood is identifying
[1:21:06] you with the voice of the blood and so
[1:21:09] if the voice speaks something that means
[1:21:11] I'm identified with it and that's what
[1:21:14] this message has done it is released to
[1:21:16] you and let you know that your name was
[1:21:19] always here in the book but it was
[1:21:21] sealed up the true Redemption was always
[1:21:24] in the book but it was sealed up you
[1:21:25] remember the violin that that brother
[1:21:27] Brandon would talk about in the
[1:21:28] unveiling of God he would say that the
[1:21:30] that the violin was on the oxion Block
[1:21:33] right and he would say that the
[1:21:34] auctioneer would say how much are we
[1:21:37] offered for the violin and one would say
[1:21:39] $1 another would say $5 one would say
[1:21:42] $10 and brother brandom says there was a
[1:21:44] man that was in the midst that did not
[1:21:47] think it should go for that little so
[1:21:49] what he would do is he would come pick
[1:21:51] up the bow tighten up the bow pick up
[1:21:53] the fiddle and would start to play music
[1:21:56] and then and then everybody started to
[1:21:58] cry they had never heard such beautiful
[1:22:01] music before and then the auctioneer
[1:22:03] would say now what am I offered for it
[1:22:05] one would say 1,000 2,000 5,000 10,000
[1:22:10] brother the Bram says what was it the
[1:22:12] Master's Hand unveiled what was hidden
[1:22:15] in the old instrument he did magically
[1:22:18] put something there he just unveiled the
[1:22:21] potential is now manifestation and
[1:22:24] inside of this old book was all
[1:22:26] potentials of an overcomer potentials of
[1:22:29] your body change potentials of your
[1:22:32] rapture but the Master's Hand would
[1:22:34] unveil it and let you know it's no more
[1:22:38] potentials but now it's manifestation
[1:22:40] and now the token the life of the blood
[1:22:44] identifies what was unveiled oh my
[1:22:47] that's why you cannot lose it's God
[1:22:49] saying hey here's the Rapture and the
[1:22:51] life inside of you says yep it's mine
[1:22:54] God says here's your body change the
[1:22:55] life says yep it's mine here's your
[1:22:57] healing yes it's mine here's your
[1:22:59] deliverance yes it's mine here's your
[1:23:02] here's your ey here's the liberty for
[1:23:04] your children yes it's mine and so it's
[1:23:07] the life of the blood identifying you
[1:23:09] with the voice of the blood oh
[1:23:12] Hallelujah it identifies you and says
[1:23:15] hey it's yours you see now whenever
[1:23:18] whenever we go and fly I got my token I
[1:23:20] got my ticket you know and I don't know
[1:23:22] if I'm the only one that gets nervous
[1:23:25] security if anybody I don't know why
[1:23:27] there's nothing they can do from keeping
[1:23:30] me on getting to my plane but I get
[1:23:32] nervous I don't know why I get there you
[1:23:35] know and I've even got that uh I've got
[1:23:37] I can't remember what what it's called
[1:23:39] now the global global entry that I don't
[1:23:42] even got to take off my shoes I don't
[1:23:44] even got to take off my belt I don't got
[1:23:46] to I don't got to take out uh my
[1:23:48] computer or iPad all I got to do was
[1:23:50] walk through and I still get nervous but
[1:23:52] you see I I'm starting to question my
[1:23:54] token all I got to do is give them my
[1:23:57] token they scan it and say okay have a
[1:23:59] good day and I just walk on right on
[1:24:01] through but you see that's what the
[1:24:02] devil does too many times he gets you to
[1:24:05] question your token that whenever you
[1:24:07] see your Revival you get nervous you see
[1:24:10] your healing you get nervous and say
[1:24:12] what if God don't hear my prayer what if
[1:24:14] God don't heal me you've got the token
[1:24:17] it don't matter what the devil says the
[1:24:19] blood speaks for you the blood speaks
[1:24:21] better things so it don't matter what
[1:24:24] the sickness says the blood speaks
[1:24:26] healing oh it don't matter what the
[1:24:28] bondage says the blood speaks Liberty
[1:24:31] and the token says yep I'm marching on
[1:24:34] through it I say this morning we need to
[1:24:36] get some courage about oursel and see
[1:24:38] I've got the token I've got the purchas
[1:24:40] product and healing is mine Deliverance
[1:24:43] is mine the Holy Ghost for my children
[1:24:45] is mine I'm not getting nervous with my
[1:24:48] token but it is mine oh Hallelujah this
[1:24:53] message has brought it to me and now the
[1:24:55] life of it is just bringing it to pass
[1:24:59] oh Hallelujah you know brother Brandon
[1:25:01] would say that in a court when the court
[1:25:03] writes out a word the penalty is such
[1:25:06] and such he says the law of the Court
[1:25:08] enforces the word of the Court oh the
[1:25:11] law of the Court enforces what the court
[1:25:14] says it don't matter the sentence it
[1:25:17] don't matter if they say man that's
[1:25:18] harsh that's crazy how come they got to
[1:25:21] do that the law of the Court enforces it
[1:25:23] it don't matter what the word is as long
[1:25:26] as it comes from the court then the law
[1:25:29] enforces it and it don't matter how hard
[1:25:32] the promises of God looks the law of God
[1:25:35] enforces the word of God so if you've
[1:25:37] got the Holy Ghost your Mountain might
[1:25:40] be as big as Caleb's Mountain was but
[1:25:42] you know what he says he says give me my
[1:25:44] mountain and you notice what Caleb would
[1:25:47] say Caleb would say we are more than
[1:25:49] able to take the land flowing with milk
[1:25:52] and honey how did he know it was flowing
[1:25:55] with milk and honey Moses had said so
[1:25:58] and so he might not have seen a yet it
[1:26:01] might have looked impossible but there
[1:26:03] was a voice that had already spoke for
[1:26:05] him oh Hallelujah and his voice was just
[1:26:09] matching up with the voice that God
[1:26:11] placed for that generation oh my you
[1:26:14] might not know how you're going to make
[1:26:16] a Rapture but your confession is just
[1:26:18] that of what the voice of the blood sees
[1:26:21] what the voice of the blood says that is
[1:26:23] My Confession I'm not letting no
[1:26:25] negative confession come out of my mouth
[1:26:28] I'm My Confession is going to be that of
[1:26:31] positive I might not know how I'm going
[1:26:33] to get up in the morning you might be
[1:26:35] sick and angry but your confession is a
[1:26:37] positive confession the blood speaks for
[1:26:40] me the blood speaks greater things not
[1:26:43] bad things greater things Abel's blood
[1:26:46] spoke condemnation but the blood of
[1:26:48] Jesus speaks of
[1:26:50] redemption oh it's greater things
[1:26:52] regardless of the condition it's the law
[1:26:56] regardless of it it's the law and it's
[1:26:58] going to come to pass and we would see
[1:27:00] that brother brandom says apply the
[1:27:02] token and claim your rights and shake it
[1:27:05] before Satan oh I love it he says shake
[1:27:08] it before Satan and claim your rights
[1:27:11] and he says no he says if if he comes
[1:27:13] with a box of rattlesnakes he says turn
[1:27:15] it back shake the token if he tries to
[1:27:18] give you Parkinson shake the token say
[1:27:21] oh no I know in my look the conditions
[1:27:23] my look Bleak the conditions might look
[1:27:26] hopeless but the blood is speaking in my
[1:27:29] behalf oh Hallelujah brother the brand
[1:27:32] would say this heal every one of these
[1:27:34] Lord Heal everyone that is sitting
[1:27:36] present that is sick who are you
[1:27:39] sickness who do you think you are Satan
[1:27:42] who do you claim to be every claim that
[1:27:45] you have was cancelled at caly you're
[1:27:49] blood you have no rights we defy you in
[1:27:52] the name of Jesus Christ and a holy
[1:27:54] ghost filled body you know what's so
[1:27:57] incredible is it's the holy go it's it's
[1:27:59] the spirit of the enemy that tries to
[1:28:01] cancel the Holy Ghost but once you make
[1:28:04] room for the Holy Ghost it cancels the
[1:28:07] claims that the devil has on your life
[1:28:09] oh but the random says who are you
[1:28:11] sickness who do you claim to be your
[1:28:14] claims were cancelled oh and I say
[1:28:16] whatever he claims to have on you the
[1:28:19] devil might have claimed your marriage
[1:28:21] but it's been cancelled the devil might
[1:28:23] have claimed your health but it's been
[1:28:25] canceled the devil might have claimed
[1:28:27] your mind but it has been canceled
[1:28:29] there's another voice that is speaking
[1:28:32] in your behalf brother Brandon would say
[1:28:34] it speaks of resurrection and life it
[1:28:36] speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it
[1:28:39] speaks of power it speaks of life it
[1:28:41] speaks of heaven and that same blood
[1:28:44] that was shed on the ground that called
[1:28:46] out after his dead brother or called
[1:28:48] after called out after his brother that
[1:28:49] that had killed him the blood of Jesus
[1:28:52] covers all our sins and speaks peace

[1:33:58] falling I don't want to water down
[1:34:00] religion I want something true but the
[1:34:03] Brandon would say in him is the fullness
[1:34:05] in him is all the sufficiency that we
[1:34:08] have need
[1:34:10] of all the sufficiency that we have need
[1:34:13] of is in him and this true token you
[1:34:17] notice whenever whenever the the
[1:34:19] children of Israel would come out of of
[1:34:22] the land of Egypt they didn't have to go
[1:34:24] look for food they God provided food he
[1:34:28] they didn't have to go find shoes god
[1:34:30] provided shoes they didn't have to go
[1:34:32] find medicine God God healed the sick
[1:34:35] all they had to do was follow the light
[1:34:38] oh my little church and himy is all the
[1:34:40] sufficiency that we have need of the
[1:34:42] blood speaks for you the blood has got
[1:34:45] your rapture brother Brandon would say
[1:34:47] but the CH the true token of the blood
[1:34:49] the true token the true token of the
[1:34:51] blood speaking out speaks of living
[1:34:54] resurrected presence the true token
[1:34:57] speaks of a living resurrected presence
[1:35:01] oh we're not Gathering here in vain
[1:35:03] we're Gathering under a living
[1:35:05] resurrected presence that in this
[1:35:08] presence Supernatural can Supernatural
[1:35:11] things can take place in this presence
[1:35:13] this morning it can fix brok it can fix
[1:35:15] broken marriages you know it was in this
[1:35:18] presence it was in this presence that
[1:35:20] whenever uh the woman that was caught in
[1:35:22] the act of adultery you remember they
[1:35:24] threw at the feet of Jesus that they
[1:35:26] might condemn him and here he stood
[1:35:29] perfect but once they threw him in threw
[1:35:31] her in his presence it released to her a
[1:35:35] liberty it released to her a separation
[1:35:38] you know brother the Brandon would say
[1:35:40] when the when the the Widow of the uh
[1:35:42] the RAB the the Harlot that would walk
[1:35:44] by Jesus at Simon's house whenever she
[1:35:47] recognized the presence of Jesus it
[1:35:50] released to her her forgiveness oh
[1:35:53] whenever brother brandom would say
[1:35:54] whenever the the woman at the well
[1:35:56] whenever she recognized that this was
[1:35:58] the Messiah it opened up a channel and
[1:36:01] the thoughts that God had in God's mind
[1:36:04] were brought back to her whenever she
[1:36:06] would recognize the presence of the the
[1:36:09] resurrected savior it would release the
[1:36:12] supernatural oh I see let's recognize
[1:36:15] who is in our midst we're not here
[1:36:17] Gathering under a Creed we're not here
[1:36:19] Gathering under a tradition we're
[1:36:21] gathering around the resurrection the
[1:36:24] presence of Jesus
[1:36:26] Christ oh that's why Rahab W the true
[1:36:29] token the Bible would tell us in Joshua
[1:36:31] 29 she said unto the men I know that the
[1:36:34] Lord hath given you the land and that
[1:36:36] your terror is Fallen upon us and all
[1:36:39] that the inhabitants of the land faint
[1:36:42] because of you for We Have Heard now how
[1:36:45] the Lord dried up the water of the Red
[1:36:47] Sea for you when you come out of Egypt
[1:36:49] and what you did unto the two kings of
[1:36:52] the amorites that were on the other side
[1:36:54] of Jordan sihon and OG will who you
[1:36:56] utterly destroyed and as soon as we
[1:36:59] heard these things our hearts did melt
[1:37:02] neither did there remain any courage in
[1:37:04] any man because of you for the Lord your
[1:37:08] God he is God in heaven above and in
[1:37:11] Earth beneath so she knew she already
[1:37:14] knew of the supernatural oh Hallelujah
[1:37:18] she already knew what Jehovah could do
[1:37:20] she already knew that Jehovah opened the
[1:37:23] Red Sea that destroyed the two kings of
[1:37:25] the amorites and she knew the only way
[1:37:28] she could be identified with the
[1:37:31] supernatural was a true token oh
[1:37:34] Hallelujah she wasn't just happy just
[1:37:37] hearing about it she wanted to
[1:37:39] experience she wanted to experience and
[1:37:42] brother Brandon would say there's no
[1:37:43] devil that can stand before it there's
[1:37:45] nothing that can stand before it because
[1:37:47] God has accepted it and you hold the
[1:37:49] token in your hand the price is paid oh
[1:37:52] it's a positive token
[1:37:54] a positive token in other words what the
[1:37:56] devil speaks is negative but God takes
[1:37:59] the negative and turns a positive so
[1:38:02] that's why you see Rahab was in a
[1:38:04] negative situation she was on the walls
[1:38:07] right she was on the wall so whenever
[1:38:08] the walls would come down she was coming
[1:38:11] down so she realized that the negative
[1:38:13] she was in was going to be her death but
[1:38:16] if she could get a true token it was a
[1:38:18] positive token that would take the
[1:38:20] negative and change the circumstance
[1:38:23] into a positive oh you know brother
[1:38:25] Brandon would talk about Oswald and
[1:38:27] would say could you imagine sting in his
[1:38:29] sale that he had killed he had just
[1:38:31] killed the president and he says now
[1:38:33] there's a supreme court that is angry at
[1:38:35] him all everybody is wanting his blood
[1:38:38] because he killed a fellow American and
[1:38:40] could you just imagine you're oswal
[1:38:42] sitting in your prison cell you're
[1:38:44] wanting somebody to speak for you right
[1:38:46] you want an attorney that can speak on
[1:38:48] your behalf but who would accept to be
[1:38:51] his voice if he's the one that killed
[1:38:54] the President right nobody wants to
[1:38:56] speak for him you know and so then
[1:38:57] brother the brandom later on in the tape
[1:38:59] would say what if you committed a crime
[1:39:01] and he says you know you're guilty the
[1:39:04] judge knows you're guilty and he says
[1:39:06] the evidence is stacked up against you
[1:39:08] and he says now if you found guilty he
[1:39:10] says you're going to go to the gas
[1:39:11] Chambers or you might be hung or you
[1:39:14] might go to the firing squad he says
[1:39:16] whatever the penalty is whenever you're
[1:39:18] found guilty you're going to die unless
[1:39:21] you get an attorney that can represent
[1:39:24] you and speak for you but he says now
[1:39:27] you you you can relax a little bit
[1:39:29] knowing you have a good attorney but you
[1:39:31] still got that fear in your mind that
[1:39:33] the attorne the attorney might not be
[1:39:36] able to change the judge's mind and then
[1:39:38] he would say this if this attorney with
[1:39:41] the shrewd speaking and knowing of the
[1:39:43] laws could change that and could plead
[1:39:45] your case and prove that you should live
[1:39:48] but yet in all of his great Authority
[1:39:50] and the great speech that he could make
[1:39:52] and the impr
[1:39:54] that he could put on the jury or on the
[1:39:56] judge that maybe you can relax for a
[1:39:58] little bit but still there was a
[1:39:59] question in your mind can he do it and I
[1:40:02] like how he's pointing back to the
[1:40:04] speech can he speak good enough can he
[1:40:07] speak elegant enough is there enough
[1:40:09] Authority in his speech to change his
[1:40:11] mind in other words this the the voice
[1:40:14] of his attorney has got to be speak
[1:40:16] greater things than that of the
[1:40:18] accusation because if it didn't speak
[1:40:20] greater things he was going to die but
[1:40:23] but then he would stop and he would say
[1:40:25] but your judge become your attorney oh
[1:40:28] Hallelujah in other ones in other words
[1:40:30] the one that gave the law speaks up for
[1:40:33] you against the law that's why we cannot
[1:40:35] be defeated is the one that put the law
[1:40:38] into motion is the one that separated
[1:40:41] you from the law and speaks in your
[1:40:44] behalf oh Hallelujah cuz whenever God
[1:40:48] does something it's opposite to what the
[1:40:50] devil does cuz the Bible would tell us
[1:40:52] in Hebrews 14 how much more shall the
[1:40:55] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[1:40:57] spirit offered for himself without
[1:41:00] without spot to God Purge your
[1:41:02] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[1:41:05] Living God in other words this true
[1:41:07] token takes you from dead Works to
[1:41:10] living works and so the negativity
[1:41:12] you're separated from and you're put
[1:41:15] into a positive and the word positive
[1:41:17] means fully assured independent or
[1:41:20] independent of changing circumstances
[1:41:23] unconditional so if we have a if we have
[1:41:26] a positive token that means what the
[1:41:28] blood speaks is fully assured that means
[1:41:31] it cannot change so the word of God
[1:41:34] concerning your life it can never change
[1:41:36] the purpose that the blood has put upon
[1:41:39] you can never change and brother Brandon
[1:41:41] would say I don't like the negative
[1:41:43] thing I don't like to get mixed up in
[1:41:45] the negative side I like a positive
[1:41:47] beyond the positive side he would say it
[1:41:50] in another place brother brandom he
[1:41:52] would say and taking man's word is
[1:41:54] uncertain but God's word is positive and
[1:41:57] that's where we're standing on today
[1:41:59] heavens and earth may pass away but his
[1:42:01] word will never fail it's a positive
[1:42:04] word you know the Bible would tell us
[1:42:06] that that the King belshazzar was
[1:42:08] troubled and the Bible would say he was
[1:42:09] troubled and his countenance was changed
[1:42:12] and I thought it was incredible that it
[1:42:14] was because he was troubled it started
[1:42:16] to change who he was and I thought that
[1:42:18] is very that's a powerful thing cuz the
[1:42:21] Bible would tell us in Luke 24:38 and he
[1:42:23] said unto them why are you troubled why
[1:42:26] do your thoughts arise or why do
[1:42:28] thoughts arise in your hearts then being
[1:42:31] troubled started them to think negative
[1:42:34] and you see that's why we cannot be
[1:42:36] troubled in our hearts because we've got
[1:42:38] a positive token why do we need to be
[1:42:40] troubled if you've got something
[1:42:42] speaking positive you see if you go
[1:42:44] through hard times we already know that
[1:42:46] we're going to get through it because
[1:42:48] something already spoke over our life
[1:42:50] the Bible would tell us in John 14:1 let
[1:42:53] not your heart be troubled you believe
[1:42:55] in God believe also in me in my father's
[1:42:59] house are many mansions and I think I
[1:43:01] love it because the Bible is putting it
[1:43:04] let your heart not be troubled he saying
[1:43:06] that they were troubled but then he
[1:43:08] would give a positive word to bring them
[1:43:10] out of the negative he would say I'm
[1:43:12] going to I'm going away but I'm going to
[1:43:15] I'm going to a place where you're going
[1:43:17] to come with me in my father's house are
[1:43:20] many mansions in other word the positive
[1:43:23] word would bring them out of the
[1:43:25] troubled condition and place them upon a
[1:43:28] solid ground oh you might be in a in a
[1:43:31] negative condition this morning but what
[1:43:33] the blood speaks is enough power to
[1:43:36] bring you out of the negative bring you
[1:43:38] out of the troubled condition and place
[1:43:41] you upon a solid
[1:43:43] rock oh the Bible would say in 2
[1:43:45] Corinthians 4:7 but we have this
[1:43:47] treasure in Earth and vessels that the
[1:43:50] Excellency of the power of God may be of
[1:43:53] God not of us we are troubled on every
[1:43:56] side yet not distressed so in the midst
[1:43:59] of the troubled situations there's a
[1:44:02] treasure inside of Earth and vessels oh
[1:44:05] that is bringing us through the
[1:44:06] troubless bringing us through the
[1:44:09] negative and placing Us in the positive
[1:44:12] oh you know right before that the Bible
[1:44:14] would tell us that uh that the same God
[1:44:16] the spoke light in the beginning has
[1:44:18] shined into our hearts in other words
[1:44:21] the same Living Word that brought order
[1:44:24] out of chaos is the same living word
[1:44:27] that has restored order in your chaos
[1:44:30] that's why we we don't have to be
[1:44:31] troubled we might be troubled on every
[1:44:34] side but our heart does not have to be
[1:44:36] troubled because we've got a positive
[1:44:38] token that is fully assured oh the devil
[1:44:42] might want to get to you but he has to
[1:44:44] get through the Living Word first and he
[1:44:46] can't get through it you know but the
[1:44:48] brand would say the only way the devil
[1:44:49] can get in is he has to be I think he
[1:44:51] says he has to be a he yes be justified
[1:44:53] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:44:55] and then he says then he's your brother
[1:44:57] right so he cannot get to you the only
[1:44:59] way for him to get to you is to become
[1:45:02] your brother oh I say we've got a
[1:45:04] positive token it's a true token it
[1:45:07] don't matter what the negativity says
[1:45:09] what complexes say what the Mind battles
[1:45:11] say we've got a positive token it's the
[1:45:14] life of the blood that is carrying us
[1:45:17] you know brother Brandon would say the
[1:45:18] blood carries us oh not the literal
[1:45:21] blood the life of the blood it carries
[1:45:24] us oh Hallelujah but we see that the
[1:45:27] king here the King was troubled but then
[1:45:30] his wife would say here's a man with an
[1:45:32] excellent spirit and he could dissolve
[1:45:34] the doubts and in Daniel 5:12 for as
[1:45:37] much an excellent spirit and knowledge
[1:45:39] and understanding interpreting of dreams
[1:45:41] and chowing of hard sentences and
[1:45:43] dissolving of doubts amen dissolving of
[1:45:47] doubts so here he was in a troubled
[1:45:49] heart but there would be a man with an
[1:45:52] excellent spirit that could dissolve the
[1:45:54] doubts and we would know what do we get
[1:45:55] in this generation was an excellent
[1:45:58] Spirit you know brother Brandon would
[1:45:59] tell us he let the let the Holy Spirit
[1:46:02] search your cons conscience and you'll
[1:46:04] agree with Daniel 5:12 when the queing
[1:46:06] when the queen came in before belshazzar
[1:46:08] and said she found out there was a
[1:46:10] Prophet Daniel that was among them he
[1:46:12] was a dissolver of the doubts and you
