[24:42] glad you're in
[24:44] church amen praise the Lord I uh before
[24:49] we get started tonight I I ran across
[24:55] um um a a some some uh articles or some
[24:59] posts that that some of us ministers
[25:02] brother brother Tim had had sent to me
[25:05] uh it's been a couple of years back and
[25:07] I and as I was um looking over some
[25:12] um for for this church age the in the
[25:16] church age book and and um I I found
[25:20] some start startling comparisons and and
[25:24] um so as we were talking I was talking
[25:26] with Mom and Dad this morning
[25:28] and it and it sort of triggered um some
[25:32] of these memories how many remembers um
[25:34] how many knows who Carl Williams is
[25:37] y'all amen if you've listened to any of
[25:40] the messages at all um uh Carl Williams
[25:45] was was was a board member um there with
[25:49] the Full Gospel
[25:51] businessman and so um he loved brother
[25:56] Brandon and
[25:58] and uh he would he would U he he would
[26:01] often fight to to have brother brandham
[26:03] to come even when brother brandham um
[26:07] had lost his PO
[26:09] popularity um he he always wanted
[26:12] brother brandham to come and to to
[26:16] minister there in the uh there they in
[26:20] the Full Gospel businessmen's meetings
[26:22] and so uh uh even even when there was
[26:25] other board members that were that were
[26:27] trying to vote to keep brother bradam
[26:29] out because of his his stance on
[26:32] Holiness his stance on on the different
[26:35] things uh of that nature he just he they
[26:38] they they they loved the they they loved
[26:41] his um um you know his um U gift they
[26:46] they love the healings and the
[26:48] Miracles but um so brother brother
[26:52] brother Carl was he he loved brother
[26:55] brandham now brother deas sharen if if
[26:59] uh if you've if you've listened to a lot
[27:01] of the sermons DEA shakarian was the one
[27:04] who started the Full Gospel
[27:06] businessmen and um and so the Full
[27:10] Gospel
[27:11] businessmen is really largely they're
[27:15] they're
[27:16] responsible for for sending brother
[27:19] brandham around the world and a lot of
[27:22] these messages that we hear um uh that
[27:26] that brother Brandon preach you know
[27:29] lots of times you you kids might think
[27:31] that it's all at at random Tabernacle
[27:33] but these are these are sermons that are
[27:35] Prett a bunch of them over in uh uh uh
[27:38] California um um uh Phoenix you know
[27:42] there was places all around and and so
[27:45] brother Branham would be the guest as as
[27:48] brother brandham he wasn't like Oral
[27:50] Roberts and Billy Graham and them who um
[27:54] back in back in the day uh they had to
[27:58] have oh my goodness I I think or Roberts
[28:01] had to have like $3,000 a day um uh
[28:07] whether he was whether he was preaching
[28:09] or wasn't preaching brother BR or
[28:10] brother or Roberts had had um uh so much
[28:14] going on that that he would have to U uh
[28:19] uh he had to be careful where he went to
[28:21] preach um and what he done because he
[28:24] had to have thousands of dollars in in
[28:28] in uh in in one meeting in order to keep
[28:32] afloat so brother bradam didn't didn't
[28:35] do that brother brandham did not want
[28:37] that they wanted to make him that way
[28:39] they they they really wanted um because
[28:42] brother brandham was a very popular man
[28:45] in fact uh when he had went off the
[28:47] scene in in in the early 50s because he
[28:50] was he he got sick um uh when he came
[28:54] back on you know his six or seven months
[28:57] that he was off um the there was a great
[29:00] big vacuum and so when he came back on 7
[29:02] months later there were dozens of new
[29:05] preachers tent meetings just going
[29:07] everywhere uh uh and these were all
[29:09] healing campaigns and things going on
[29:12] and they say that within the first month
[29:15] of brother brandham back on the field
[29:18] brother brandham was already dominating
[29:21] of the meetings he he he had the largest
[29:24] crowds um and and the supernatural they
[29:27] they said there was no one that could
[29:30] compare the supernatural uh that that
[29:33] could compare with brother brandham
[29:34] Supernatural gift and so um uh so Deus
[29:38] sharan he was the one that and that the
[29:41] the Full Gospel businessman was an
[29:43] organization that was that was broke uh
[29:46] or that was set up that that would just
[29:48] break the denominational barriers Deon
[29:51] sharan had a had a desire to to to to
[29:55] bring to bring in uh the Baptist and the
[29:58] Presbyterian and the Catholic and the
[30:00] Methodist and and bring them all in and
[30:03] give them a chance for the baptism of
[30:04] the Holy Ghost and and it was a quite a
[30:07] successful it was a successful
[30:10] organization and um in fact the Full
[30:12] Gospel businessmen International is
[30:14] still is still uh going
[30:18] today but DEA shakarian um
[30:22] he uh it was it was it sort of they both
[30:26] worked hand in hand
[30:27] because brother brandham made the Full
[30:31] Gospel uh businessmen famous and the
[30:34] Full Gospel businessman uh uh uh
[30:38] organization was the was the vehicle and
[30:41] so uh as brother branam as the people
[30:44] begin to seek for brother brandham and
[30:46] the and the gift and and when he would
[30:48] come in as you know as a household name
[30:51] well uh the Full Gospel businessman was
[30:54] bringing him in and and and brother
[30:55] Brandon was just content come in and and
[30:58] and preach the services they dealt with
[31:00] all the finances he didn't have to deal
[31:02] with anything and U he was receiving his
[31:06] $100 a week uh uh from the uh or the
[31:10] what whatever it was he was getting from
[31:12] the Tabernacle and so he didn't have
[31:14] anything else that he needed besides
[31:16] that but as as the as the seals were
[31:19] open and as brother Brandon began to get
[31:21] very direct in those first in in those
[31:23] last three years of his ministry Deus um
[31:27] begin to to pull back and and and uh
[31:33] because uh he was catching a little bit
[31:35] of flack from from uh the women that as
[31:39] brother brandham was hitting so hard
[31:40] against sin and and and and those kinds
[31:43] of

[38:11] Kardashian is a third generation
[38:14] American
[38:16] Armenian and most famous for his role in
[38:18] helping defend the former M NFL star OJ
[38:23] Simpson in his notorious murder trial in
[38:25] 1995
[38:27] research by The Daily Mail has recently
[38:30] uncovered a strange story of how a
[38:32] prophetic word by an an 11e old boy
[38:36] saved Kim's family on her father's side
[38:40] from The Armenian Genocide the
[38:43] Kardashian
[38:44] family originated in in Russia and at
[38:48] that time had the last name Cardis Goofs
[38:52] sometime in the mid to late 1800s they
[38:55] moved to the Village of
[38:57] of kacel in in present day Turkey it is
[39:01] found near Mount
[39:04] erat considered the resting place of
[39:08] Noah's Ark the family was considered
[39:10] religious Rebels as they did not belong
[39:12] to the Russian Orthodox church but
[39:15] instead favored the Protestant Group
[39:17] malikan which uh translated means milk
[39:21] lovers they were tagged with it with the
[39:23] name because the Russian Orthodox fast
[39:26] days uh they drunk milk which was
[39:28] forbidden the Russia the Russian
[39:31] Orthodox Church branded them as Heretics
[39:33] and Heavenly persecuted the
[39:35] group the particular uh Mullan group the
[39:39] Kardashian family belonged to was
[39:41] impacted by an outpouring of the holy
[39:44] spirit in
[39:46] 1833 as a result their services uh their
[39:50] services took on a very Pentecostal
[39:52] flavor including raising their hands in
[39:55] worship and dancing jumping prophecy and
[39:58] other Holy Spirit
[39:59] manifestations there was also a release
[40:01] of Miracles said to rival that of the
[40:03] early in the early church one person
[40:06] influenced by this outpouring was
[40:09] etham
[40:11] clenin during the
[40:14] 1850s as a as an 11-year-old boy he
[40:18] received a prophetic Revelation that
[40:20] many Armenians would die unless they
[40:22] fled the area to a land across the great
[40:25] ocean he said those who believe in this
[40:28] will go on a journey to a far land and
[40:31] while the unbelievers will remain in
[40:33] place our people will go on a long
[40:35] journey over the great and deep Waters
[40:38] people from all countries will go there
[40:41] there will be a great War all Kings will
[40:43] shed blood like Great Rivers two
[40:46] steamships will leave the uh to cross
[40:49] the impassible ocean and though the
[40:52] molans believed in Prophecy because it
[40:54] came from a boy it was basically ignored
[40:57] however in
[40:58] 1901 epim now grown called a meeting of
[41:02] the Elders of the Mullan churches and
[41:04] villages in these areas
[41:06] surrounding caracelli and he reminded
[41:10] them of the prophetic word he received
[41:12] 40 years earlier he told them that
[41:14] decades old prophecy would soon come to
[41:17] pass and people needed to leave he added
[41:20] to uh uh two further Revelations one was
[41:24] a warning that there was a small window
[41:26] of opportunity the Armenians needed to
[41:28] move quickly because the government
[41:31] would soon close the door to the people
[41:33] leaving the country the second what was
[41:36] that there was not only they was not
[41:38] only to go to the US but to America's
[41:41] West
[41:42] Coast used and used a crudely drawn map
[41:46] to point to California over the next
[41:49] decade or so about 2,000 Armenians
[41:52] obeyed the prophecy abandoned their
[41:53] homes fled to America and those who
[41:56] stayed behind mock the families as they
[41:58] departed
[41:59] 1913 Kim's
[42:01] great-grandfather tatos Kardashian then
[42:04] 17 headed on a steamer to America
[42:08] following his parents who had left a few
[42:10] weeks earlier to Los angelist he would
[42:13] eventually marry a fellow Armenian and
[42:16] malikan Refugee Hamas hamus
[42:20] shakarian those who left avoided The
[42:23] Armenian Genocide of uh of 1915 to
[42:28] 1923 where it's estimated the Turks
[42:31] slaughtered upwards towards 1.5 million
[42:34] Armenians the World War I between 2 uh
[42:38] 1914 to
[42:39] 1918 and then and the 197 Russian
[42:43] Revolution what I found unusual is why
[42:46] the prophecy told them specifically to
[42:48] go to the US West Coast the answer to
[42:52] that question may lie in the isusa
[42:53] street Pentecostal Revival that took
[42:55] place place in Los Angeles between 1906
[42:58] and
[42:59] 1915 because of their previous
[43:01] experience with the Holy Spirit the
[43:04] mikans in both Doctrine and spirit
[43:06] played an important role in this Holy
[43:08] Spirit outpouring which sparked the
[43:10] worldwide Pentecostal movement Kim's
[43:14] great great-grandfather DEA shakarian
[43:16] father of Tat's wife hamus was a famous
[43:20] Pentecostal preacher in Los Angeles and
[43:23] his grandson was given the same name and
[43:26] followed his grandfather in Ministry
[43:29] deas shakarian who was born in
[43:32] 1913 founded the Full Gospel
[43:35] businessmen's Fellowship
[43:38] International in
[43:40] 1952 and though the uh the ruling otoman
[43:43] government was Islamic many believe the
[43:45] motivation behind the Armenian Genocide
[43:48] was largely political political versus
[43:50] religion uh according to the history.com
[43:53] this resentment was compounded by
[43:55] suspicious
[43:56] that the Christian Armenians would be
[43:59] more loyal to Christian governments that
[44:01] of uh the Russians for example who
[44:03] shared um an unstable border with turkey
[44:07] that were to be uh that were to the
[44:09] ottoman kif CIF so so I so we'll just
[44:14] stop we'll just stop right there so Kim
[44:18] Kardashian is the
[44:21] granddaughter of deus
[44:25] shakar
[44:27] and you you you look at that because
[44:29] Deus seen the the the gift of God in
[44:32] brother bradam but he did not follow on
[44:36] with the
[44:37] word in fact in fact it has been said
[44:42] that that uh uh that that uh Deus has
[44:48] had had had before he had passed away
[44:51] had made major public statements that

[44:56] and and the pope was was um uh a sin of

[47:47] ages um but but God's desire was for a
[47:54] people that he could live in Express
[47:57] himself through brother brandom put it
[48:00] put it very beautifully he says um and
[48:04] and and we've we've already read this
[48:06] and I I and if we take too much time
[48:08] going back over some of this other stuff
[48:10] um I we won't be able to get too much oh
[48:13] let's go for it let let's go to uh page
[48:17] 257 amen uh I loved brother I love what
[48:21] brother brandom had said here on um uh
[48:24] page
[48:27] uh
[48:32] 257 and we're going to go all the way
[48:34] down to the to the last
[48:38] paragraph and when you're there you can
[48:40] say
[48:43] amen
[48:45] amen he says now I wish I could say that
[48:47] the sardian age was a restoration
[48:49] instead of a Reformation I cannot say
[48:52] that the word does not call it a
[48:54] restoration but but certainly calls it a
[48:57] Reformation had it been a restoration
[49:00] the age would have been another
[49:01] Pentecostal age that's that's just
[49:03] beautiful isn't it but it was not the
[49:07] best could be said of it was strengthen
[49:11] that which remains that is ready to die
[49:14] there was something missing my yes there
[49:17] certainly was this age had justification
[49:21] but it had Miss s it had justification
[49:23] but it had Miss sanctification in the
[49:25] baptism with the Holy Ghost that was
[49:28] God's original plan and the reason I'm
[49:31] want I'm going back to this tonight is I
[49:33] want you to keep that in mind that was
[49:36] God's original plan they were Justified
[49:40] they were Sanctified they were filled
[49:43] with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the
[49:46] reason somebody say the reason for being
[49:49] justified and Sanctified is to the end
[49:53] that you might be baptized Ed with the
[49:56] Holy Ghost this is the reason there is a
[49:59] church it is the temple of God filled
[50:03] with God even the Holy Ghost The Same
[50:06] Spirit that was in Jesus while he was
[50:09] here on Earth causing him to do the
[50:11] mighty Works which he
[50:13] did uh came back upon the church at
[50:16] Pentecost so that they did this The
[50:19] Works that he did this age did not have
[50:22] those works oh they had the written word
[50:24] but not the revealed word this was a
[50:26] Reformation period but little but fear
[50:29] not little flock God said I will
[50:32] restore this reform was going to be the
[50:36] start of it it was going to according to
[50:39] his promise take the church back from
[50:41] the depths of Satan in the dark ages to
[50:45] the depth of God they had at Pentecost
[50:49] and in the first few years of the
[50:51] existence of the church so so he's going
[50:54] to so his desire desire his whole desire
[50:57] is to take us out of the depths of Satan
[51:01] and bring us in to the depths of God
[51:05] that they had at Pentecost now that is
[51:09] what God had in mind all along that's
[51:11] the model church and that's the reason
[51:14] why brother bradam says the church that
[51:17] every age wants to be is that first
[51:21] church that original church at the very
[51:25] beginning can you say Amen now now
[51:29] brother brandham would would would also
[51:31] he he would say that you are another
[51:33] creation you're a you're a creation of
[51:36] himself and that God and man has joined
[51:40] and that that you are that he was the
[51:43] first of the new race and and and and
[51:47] His glory was was to be upon you now
[51:54] while you're still there in that
[51:57] um um let's
[52:01] see um while we're still there in in the
[52:04] sardian church age uh
[52:06] 250 and and um well
[52:12] we're let's see um I've got
[52:20] 250 and it'll be the second paragraph it
[52:24] says yes the spirit is not seven spirits
[52:27] but one he will always be the same and
[52:29] act the same the seven Messengers will
[52:33] have the same spirit and teach the same
[52:36] word and have the same power and if the
[52:40] church is the true church it will have
[52:43] the very same spirit and word and acts
[52:47] of power they had at Pentecost and by
[52:50] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[52:53] Church there will be tongues
[52:55] interpretation prophecies healings God
[52:57] will be in the midst of her and God will
[53:01] declare himself in the midst of her as
[53:03] he always has Hallelujah she will be

[56:35] the nicians now now the nicians were
[56:40] were were some men that were among them
[56:43] in the church who were trying to usurp
[56:46] their Authority claiming to be
[56:50] Apostles um and and and the word nickan
[56:53] simply means niiko is to conquer uh
[56:56] letin means to the
[56:59] Ley it was an invasive spirit that was
[57:04] that was um that brother badam says was
[57:07] not even a Doctrine it wasn't a teaching
[57:09] it wasn't but these were Deeds these
[57:12] these were these were so minuscule it
[57:16] just they they were actions that were
[57:21] trying uh to to put men ahead of the
[57:25] word of God now they weren't they
[57:27] weren't they weren't taken away from
[57:29] anything the Apostle Paul said they they
[57:32] weren't doing that but but some of their
[57:34] actions were just sort of defying what
[57:37] what the Apostle Paul was putting in
[57:39] there they were they were they were
[57:42] organizing men and and and and trying to
[57:46] put things together trying to help God
[57:49] out they they they they were tired of
[57:53] persecution and they were trying to make
[57:57] the gospel more appealable to others and
[58:02] so so these men there was just some men
[58:06] that were that were trying to help God
[58:09] out amen and Buddy the Bible says that
[58:15] that that they um as we're fixing to
[58:18] read here
[58:21] they the church wasn't going to have it
[58:24] so let's start here let's let's look
[58:25] here in in Ephesians uh or in um uh page
[58:30] 81 under Christ Praises his own
[58:33] Revelations 2 and 2 I Know Thy works and
[58:37] thy labor and thy patience how thou
[58:40] canst not bear them that are
[58:43] evil thou Hast tried them which say they
[58:46] are Apostles and are not thou Hast found
[58:48] them liars and hasth borne and has
[58:51] patience and for my name's sake hasth
[58:54] labored and has not fainted now we we
[58:57] read some of this this portion of it the
[58:59] other night but I just we're just going
[59:00] to do here to get going how
[59:05] beautiful how how beautiful the Savior
[59:08] praises and commends his children he
[59:10] takes full account of their spiritual
[59:12] attitudes and behavior he knows that
[59:14] there is weakness among them but as yet
[59:17] he does not cry out against it isn't
[59:20] that just like the Lord he knows how to
[59:24] encourage us in the right matters and
[59:25] discourage Us in the wrong matters we
[59:28] could all learn a good lesson right here
[59:30] in running the church and our families
[59:33] and better still we could all learn a
[59:34] good lesson and that God deals with each
[59:37] of each one of us in the exactly this
[59:40] way don't ever be discouraged saing of
[59:42] God for God is not ungracious to forget
[59:45] your labors of love where whatever we do
[59:49] even giving a cup of cold water has a
[59:51] reward and a blessing from the Lord I
[59:53] Know Thy work Works thy labor thy
[59:56] patience he walks in the midst of the
[59:58] church he is aware of the suffering of
[1:00:00] his people he cares it it was as it was
[1:00:04] in the days of the Captivity in Egypt
[1:00:06] when he heard their cries he who never
[1:00:09] changes still hears the cries of the
[1:00:11] oppressed as he walks among them the
[1:00:15] very word labor signifies weariness
[1:00:18] through
[1:00:18] oppression God's people do not only work
[1:00:21] for him in a labor of love but they
[1:00:23] suffer for him with joy they are patient
[1:00:26] and bearing the Yoke the first aid
[1:00:28] suffered great
[1:00:29] persecution it had to work it had to
[1:00:32] work hard to preach the gospel and shed
[1:00:34] forth the truth and their calling their
[1:00:38] High Calling in life was to serve God
[1:00:41] and when their hopes in life were
[1:00:42] blighted they were patient and committed
[1:00:44] all to him and who had promised a
[1:00:47] lasting recompense in
[1:00:50] heaven for what they had given up for
[1:00:53] him on Earth I love that I love that
[1:00:55] line right there I think we ought to
[1:00:58] stop here and and deal with the thought
[1:01:00] that God's people have always been and
[1:01:02] always will be persecuted you know that
[1:01:05] Genesis is the book of beginnings and
[1:01:07] when you find uh what you find started
[1:01:11] right uh there will carry right on
[1:01:14] through the Revelation and never change
[1:01:17] and there we can see that uh there we
[1:01:20] see that Cain persecuted and killed Abel
[1:01:23] because the latter pleased God then we
[1:01:26] see the perfect picture in Abraham's son
[1:01:28] of the flesh ish who teased and fought
[1:01:30] the son of the promise
[1:01:33] Isaac there was Esau who hated
[1:01:36] Jacob and would have killed him had not
[1:01:39] God intervened in the New Testament we
[1:01:41] find Judas betraying Jesus while the
[1:01:44] religious orders of the first century
[1:01:45] attempted to destroy the early Believers
[1:01:48] the children of this world controlled by
[1:01:50] the devil hate the children of God who
[1:01:52] are controlled by the spirit no matter
[1:01:54] how just and upright a Christian is
[1:01:56] before the public and how gracious he is
[1:01:59] to his fellow man doing not but good let
[1:02:02] him confess that Christ confess Christ
[1:02:05] as his Savior and acknowledge the
[1:02:07] operation of the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] in tongues prophecy healing Miracles and
[1:02:12] he will be condemned the spirit of this
[1:02:15] world hates the spirit of God because it
[1:02:18] can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it
[1:02:21] tries to destroy the vessel in whom the
[1:02:24] spirit of Truth dwells that's powerful
[1:02:28] that's powerful persecutions and trials
[1:02:31] are a natural normal part of the
[1:02:33] Christian Life there is only one thing
[1:02:36] that you can you can do about them
[1:02:37] commit them all to God judge not and
[1:02:40] leave their outworking and final
[1:02:42] judgment to him thou cast not bear them
[1:02:45] which are evil thou Hast tried them
[1:02:47] which say they are Apostles and are not
[1:02:50] and thou Hast found them Liars these
[1:02:52] Ephesians believe that God's people
[1:02:54] ought to be holy according to this verse
[1:02:57] they Tau steps to keep the body
[1:02:59] unleavened from sin most evidently the
[1:03:03] apostasy had already started sin had
[1:03:06] entered into the church but they were
[1:03:09] obedient to the words of Paul when he
[1:03:11] said to put away the wicked from amongst
[1:03:14] them and they were a separate people
[1:03:16] they had come out of the world and now
[1:03:19] they weren't going to let the world
[1:03:21] enter amongst them they would not put up
[1:03:24] with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a
[1:03:27] phrase with them or a figurative speech
[1:03:30] it was a way of life how many can say
[1:03:35] amen amen they believed it now now I
[1:03:39] want you to catch this yet the Deeds
[1:03:42] were coming among them and when they
[1:03:43] seen it they were still standing this is
[1:03:46] where the two trees are fixing to start
[1:03:48] coming up amen thou has tried them that
[1:03:52] say they are Apostles and N not not and
[1:03:55] has found them
[1:03:56] Liars my that is a blunt statement thou
[1:03:59] has tried them who call themselves
[1:04:01] Apostles isn't that
[1:04:04] presumptuous what right has a people to
[1:04:06] try those who call themselves Apostles
[1:04:09] how do they try them oh I love this here
[1:04:13] here it is in Galatians 1
[1:04:15] and8 but though we are an angel from
[1:04:18] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:04:22] than that which we have already preached
[1:04:24] unto you let him be accursed it was the
[1:04:27] apostles who brought the original word
[1:04:29] to the people that original word could
[1:04:33] not change somebody say could not change
[1:04:36] not even a DOT or a dash of it Paul knew
[1:04:40] it was of God who had spoke it to him so
[1:04:43] he said even if I come and try to give a
[1:04:47] second Revelation try to make one little
[1:04:49] change in what I've already uh gave
[1:04:51] originally let me be a curse first you
[1:04:55] see Paul knew the first revelation was
[1:04:57] correct Co God can't give a first
[1:05:00] revelation and then a second Revelation
[1:05:02] if he did he would be changing his mind
[1:05:05] he can give a revelation and then add to
[1:05:08] it as he did in the Garden of Eden when
[1:05:11] he promised the seed to the woman and
[1:05:13] then later designated the seed uh
[1:05:16] designated that seed had to come through
[1:05:19] Abraham and then later said it would
[1:05:21] come by the Bloodlines in David but it
[1:05:24] was the same
[1:05:26] Revelation it only gave the people more
[1:05:29] information to help them receive and
[1:05:32] understand it God's word can't
[1:05:35] change the seed came exactly as revealed
[1:05:39] Hallelujah so what those false apost
[1:05:43] what were those false Apostles
[1:05:46] doing they came with their own word and
[1:05:49] those Ephesians knew that word as Paul
[1:05:52] had taught it
[1:05:55] uh those PE knew that word as Paul had
[1:05:57] taught it they were full of the Holy
[1:05:59] Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands
[1:06:02] they looked those false Apostles in the
[1:06:05] eye and said you're not saying what what
[1:06:07] Paul said you are their false oh that
[1:06:12] sets my heart on fire get back to the
[1:06:16] word it is not you that really tries the
[1:06:19] Apostle and prophet and teacher it is
[1:06:23] the word that tries
[1:06:26] them and I don't care who it is I don't
[1:06:29] care I don't care who it is that wants
[1:06:32] to come in and try to tell us well
[1:06:34] brother brandham don't mean that or no
[1:06:37] no no no no no no no brother brandham
[1:06:40] was a prophet to bring us back to the
[1:06:44] original thus saeth the
[1:06:47] Lord and how are you going to try Amen
[1:06:51] brother bam just he just gave it it's
[1:06:54] not you that tries the Apostle the
[1:06:57] prophet and the teacher it is the word
[1:07:01] that tries them and so that's what we've
[1:07:04] got to do when people say well we don't
[1:07:06] believe in that we don't believe in the
[1:07:07] moving of the spirit oh we we're beyond

[1:07:27] no God has sent us the word of life and
[1:07:33] you must believe every word of
[1:07:38] it every word of it can you say Amen we
[1:07:43] we we don't get to pick and choose what
[1:07:45] we want we don't get to do that but I
[1:07:49] promise you if you will accept the word
[1:07:52] the way the prophet gave it and way the
[1:07:55] Bible gave it it'll be the same Pillar
[1:07:58] of Fire coming down and backing that
[1:08:00] word up in your
[1:08:02] life Hallelujah I would rather oh my

[1:08:33] the Le odyssean Church age and you will
[1:08:35] know if he's a real one sent from God or
[1:08:37] not yes you will for if he is of God he
[1:08:41] will be in that word exactly as God gave
[1:08:43] it to Paul he won't deviate from that
[1:08:46] word for a moment not by one iota in
[1:08:50] this last age when there will be many
[1:08:52] false prophets appearing watch and see
[1:08:56] uh how they'll keep telling the people
[1:08:58] that if they don't believe them and what
[1:09:00] they say you will be
[1:09:02] lost but when the last day Prophet comes
[1:09:05] on the scene if he is truly that prophet
[1:09:09] he will be crying back crying out get
[1:09:13] back to the word or you are

[1:12:06] chapter then I go and write it back down
[1:12:08] and that way I can I can I can just keep
[1:12:11] tabs of a lot of that but here's what
[1:12:13] brother brandham said he says now in
[1:12:15] every case you will notice and this is
[1:12:17] in the Le oysan Church age I thought it
[1:12:20] was it's in the 300s I thought it was
[1:12:23] somewhere around the 350 it's under the
[1:12:26] it's under the messenger section okay
[1:12:29] let me let me look here I bet if I can

[1:13:01] marked and it's 330 not 350
[1:13:05] 330 okay and we're going to go now this
[1:13:07] is one in this this is one huge it's the
[1:13:10] the whole page is one
[1:13:12] paragraph okay so you're going to go
[1:13:14] down to the it's it's below the second
[1:13:18] half um if you cut your page in half
[1:13:22] we're not going to read the whole thing
[1:13:25] um you you'll see if if you do it in
[1:13:27] half it'll be right there at 1 Timothy
[1:13:29] 4:1 do youall see that all right now the
[1:13:32] spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[1:13:34] latter times some shall depart from the
[1:13:36] faith giving heeds to seducing Spirits
[1:13:38] doctrines of devils now in every case
[1:13:41] you will notice that a false prophet is
[1:13:43] one that is outside the word just as we
[1:13:45] have showed you that Antichrist means
[1:13:48] anti- word so these false prophets come
[1:13:51] perverting the word giving it a meaning
[1:13:54] that fits their own devilish ends have
[1:13:57] you ever have you ever noticed how that
[1:13:59] people who lead others asay bind them
[1:14:03] closely to themselves by fear saying
[1:14:08] that if the people don't do what they
[1:14:10] say or if they leave then destruction
[1:14:14] will follow they are false prophets for
[1:14:18] a true Prophet will always lead one to
[1:14:21] the word and by B the people to Jesus
[1:14:26] Christ he will tell the people to fear
[1:14:30] he will not tell the people to fear Him
[1:14:33] or what he
[1:14:34] says but to fear what the word says can
[1:14:39] I hear a great big
[1:14:42] amen now that's what we put we do not
[1:14:46] the
[1:14:47] ministry we do not lead by
[1:14:51] fear say Satan and and and
[1:14:55] husbands hear me and and and the way you
[1:14:59] handle your children and the way you
[1:15:00] handle your wife Satan Works Satan works
[1:15:06] by
[1:15:07] force God is a shepherd He is not a
[1:15:15] cowboy you drive cattle but you lead
[1:15:20] sheep that's right if you want your
[1:15:23] family to follow then then then you
[1:15:26] cannot be a driver you've got to be amen
[1:15:31] a a leader now I and and I'm I'm not
[1:15:33] going to uh uh brother brother Brandon
[1:15:37] this is in th in the th tyan Church age
[1:15:39] guys I I wouldn't I I just put these the
[1:15:42] these are in my notes i' I've got 59
[1:15:44] pages of notes and I was not planning on
[1:15:46] reading this but it just hit me as we
[1:15:47] looked at this all right I'll get I'll
[1:15:50] get some of these the pages to you it
[1:15:52] says remember this
[1:15:53] is the false Vine let it name the name
[1:15:56] of the Lord it does so only in a lie
[1:16:00] it's headship is not of the Lord but of
[1:16:03] Satan and it finally ends up completely
[1:16:06] identified with the Beast the wh riding
[1:16:09] on the Scarlet Beast distinctly shows
[1:16:12] her power is the god of force Satan and
[1:16:17] not our God the Lord Jesus Christ can
[1:16:20] can you say Amen so so now brother
[1:16:23] brandham is is is is showing us that we
[1:16:26] are not to there is there is
[1:16:28] force that's that the Holy Spirit don't
[1:16:31] even for he is a
[1:16:33] gentleman we are
[1:16:35] gentle we follow the leadership you've
[1:16:39] got to follow him because you love him
[1:16:43] that's right amen can can you say amen
[1:16:45] and so as Ministers of the
[1:16:49] Gospel I I I am I am not to force my own
[1:16:52] way
[1:16:54] and and there's many of times I know
[1:16:56] destruction is going to come and I give
[1:16:59] the warning and I and I show but I can't
[1:17:03] I I I can't go out there and slash tires
[1:17:06] and and and uh take the gas out of the
[1:17:09] card and so
[1:17:11] no if you've got true
[1:17:14] leadership respect that
[1:17:17] leadership don't walk over a good
[1:17:20] man well praise the Lord that goes for
[1:17:24] pastor that goes for
[1:17:26] husband that goes for
[1:17:29] parents if you've got good
[1:17:32] leadership then honor that and respect
[1:17:36] that because they
[1:17:38] truly have your interest in mind that's
[1:17:42] right they're not they're not beating
[1:17:43] you and demanding and telling no no no
[1:17:46] no no no they're trying to lead you in a
[1:17:49] certain direction and we want to have
[1:17:53] that we want to be led of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:56] amen all right so let's go on praise the
[1:18:02] Lord now um let's see are we in that
[1:18:05] first paragraph yet he say now these
[1:18:09] these false
[1:18:10] Apostles are the Grievious wolves we're
[1:18:13] back on 84 and the first paragraph I
[1:18:16] don't include the one that was up above
[1:18:18] it that was part of the LA last page
[1:18:21] these false Apostles are griev wolves
[1:18:24] that Paul spoke of he said once I'm gone
[1:18:27] they will try to come and claim equal
[1:18:30] Revelation but their purpose is not to
[1:18:33] help you but destroy you acts
[1:18:37] 20:27 for I have not shun to declare
[1:18:40] unto you all the counsel of God take
[1:18:43] heed therefore unto yourselves and to
[1:18:45] all and to all the flock over which the
[1:18:47] Holy Spirit hath made you overseers to
[1:18:49] feed the Church of God which he hath
[1:18:51] purchased with his own blood for I know
[1:18:54] this that after my departure my
[1:18:56] departing shall Grievous wolves enter in
[1:18:58] among you not sparing the flock also of
[1:19:01] your own selves shall men arise speaking
[1:19:05] perverse things their own word and ideas
[1:19:08] and not Gods to draw away disciples
[1:19:11] after them therefore watch and remember
[1:19:14] that by the space of three years I cease
[1:19:16] not to warn everyone night and day with
[1:19:20] tears and now brethren I commend you to
[1:19:23] God and to the word of his grace which
[1:19:26] is able to build you up and to give an
[1:19:28] inheritance among all them which are
[1:19:30] Sanctified you know when I read that
[1:19:33] with
[1:19:33] tears can't you hear Brother brandom
[1:19:36] those last few years couldn't you hear
[1:19:39] his heart just a crying saying don't go
[1:19:42] into that system don't go I'm begging
[1:19:47] you in the name of the Lord stay out of
[1:19:50] that world Council of churches you could
[1:19:53] hear the Holy Spirit crying through that
[1:19:56] Prophet yes sir he says John knew of
[1:20:00] them also that uh for he said there in 1
[1:20:04] John 4:1 many false prophets are already
[1:20:06] going into the world that Antichrist
[1:20:09] Spirit was already infil the
[1:20:13] church infiltrating the church and it
[1:20:15] was doing it by going against the word
[1:20:19] why here is where it all started right
[1:20:22] here in the first Church age already
[1:20:24] they were denying the word setting up
[1:20:26] their own Creeds and philosophies
[1:20:28] instead of the word this is Antichrist
[1:20:31] for Jesus is the word and to be anti- is
[1:20:33] to be Antichrist to be anti- is to be
[1:20:37] Antichrist because the spirit and the
[1:20:39] word are one if you are anti- word you
[1:20:42] will have to be
[1:20:44] Antichrist if it started in the first
[1:20:46] age it will have to grow until the end
[1:20:50] when it takes over and that's exactly
[1:20:52] what what you will see as we cover all
[1:20:54] the ages it starts out real small in the
[1:20:58] Ephesian age and it grows in every age
[1:21:01] until the anti- word Antichrist system
[1:21:04] takes over entirely and the
[1:21:06] infallibility of the word is repudiated
[1:21:08] by by false prophets and and of the
[1:21:11] false church now it is easy to get the
[1:21:13] wrong impression of what we are talking
[1:21:15] about because I'm making this so strong
[1:21:18] it could sound to you as though this is
[1:21:20] anti- anti- though this anti- word
[1:21:23] Antichrist is completely repudiation a
[1:21:26] complete repudiation of the word a
[1:21:28] denial of the Bible culminating in its
[1:21:31] rejection no sir it is not that what it
[1:21:35] is is Revelations 20 and 18 for I
[1:21:39] testify unto every man that heareth the
[1:21:41] words of the prophecy of this book If
[1:21:44] any man shall add unto these things God
[1:21:47] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[1:21:49] written in this book If any man shall
[1:21:52] take take away from the words of the
[1:21:54] book of this prophecy God shall take
[1:21:56] away his part out of the book of life
[1:21:59] out of the holy city and from the things
[1:22:01] that are written in this book it is it
[1:22:05] is the changing of just one word by
[1:22:08] taking away or adding to it it is the
[1:22:11] original trick of Satan in the Garden of
[1:22:14] Eden he just added one little word to
[1:22:16] what God had said that did it it brought
[1:22:19] death and destruction and in Ephesus it
[1:22:22] was just the same just a word added just
[1:22:26] a word taken away and the anti- word
[1:22:29] anti-christ Spirit begin to flourish now
[1:22:33] now do you did you catch that we don't
[1:22:35] want to add to we don't want to take
[1:22:39] away we got to keep it exactly like God
[1:22:44] said because his words are
[1:22:48] Eternal he wants a church a word church
[1:22:54] that he can flow
[1:22:56] through as I was saying last Wednesday
[1:22:58] night now now we can't just say that and
[1:23:01] and we're sitting in a church and we're
[1:23:03] just say man we got all kinds of
[1:23:04] Revelation we've got to put this into
[1:23:06] action outside the doors everything we
[1:23:09] do outside those doors should be in the
[1:23:12] word temper shouldn't be flaring because
[1:23:16] that that's not the way it should go
[1:23:19] amen bad deals or or Shady deals should
[1:23:22] not be done there should there should be
[1:23:24] a reality of that word in our lives
[1:23:29] because one iota out of place will keep
[1:23:32] the Holy Spirit from his gift in you
[1:23:36] that's right can you say amen amen now
[1:23:40] he
[1:23:41] says he says do you get it now there are
[1:23:44] those there are those twins again there
[1:23:46] are those two trees again growing side
[1:23:49] by side in the same Earth and taken uh
[1:23:51] partaking of the the same nourishment
[1:23:53] drinking in the same rain benefitting
[1:23:56] from the same Sun but they come from
[1:23:59] different seeds one tree is for the word
[1:24:01] of God exactly as God gave it and loves
[1:24:04] and obeys it the other tree is from the
[1:24:07] seed that is anti the word of God and
[1:24:10] changes it where it wants to it
[1:24:13] substitutes its own Creeds dogmas for
[1:24:16] for the living true word exactly as it
[1:24:19] did Cain who ended up killing Abel but
[1:24:22] fear not little flock stay with the word
[1:24:27] keep that word between you and the devil
[1:24:31] Eve did not do that and she fell and
[1:24:33] when the church lets down on the word
[1:24:35] she goes into the depths of the darkness
[1:24:37] of Satan and has borne and has patience
[1:24:41] and for my name's sake has labored and
[1:24:44] has not fainted now this is just about
[1:24:47] the same as the verse as as was said in
[1:24:49] verse two but in verse two the work
[1:24:53] labor and patience were from guarding
[1:24:55] the separate the the sacred word which
[1:24:58] was committed unto them how they kept
[1:25:01] away the adversaries what a credit they
[1:25:04] were to Paul but in this verse their
[1:25:08] persecutions and trials and Patience are
[1:25:12] over the Blessed name of Jesus you know
[1:25:15] that it's not you know that it is not at
[1:25:18] all strange for this uh for it is the
[1:25:21] word and the name that brings the enemy
[1:25:23] pouring after us like a flood that
[1:25:27] Mighty word which was manifested in
[1:25:29] healing signs wonders and other
[1:25:32] demonstrations caused the Pharisees to
[1:25:34] scream out for the death of the True
[1:25:36] Believers now that name hated and
[1:25:39] despised by the Jews is mocked by the
[1:25:41] culture as they laughed to think anyone
[1:25:45] could be so foolish as to believe in a
[1:25:47] man who died and rose again and is now
[1:25:50] seated in heaven so here were the
[1:25:52] religious persecutors the Jews cursing
[1:25:55] this Jesus who to them was a false
[1:25:58] Messiah and here were the others
[1:25:59] laughing with delight and mocking
[1:26:01] sarcastically at the name of a new God
[1:26:04] who to them wasn't a god at all now here
[1:26:07] is something else that started in the
[1:26:09] age in that age and we'll continue right
[1:26:11] on down Through the Ages and get deeper
[1:26:13] and darker that is people were
[1:26:16] repudiating that name it was not the
[1:26:19] true Ephesian church that was doing it
[1:26:21] no sir
[1:26:22] it was the false prophets it was The
[1:26:25] Outsider trying to get in and defile the
[1:26:29] Believers the Ephesians knew that name
[1:26:32] and loved it recall the origin of of the
[1:26:35] Ephesian church a little group of people
[1:26:39] who were looking for the Messiah heard
[1:26:41] that a prophet who called himself the
[1:26:43] Forerunner of the Messiah and had
[1:26:45] appeared in the desert of Palestine and
[1:26:48] was baptizing people under repentance
[1:26:51] and then these re received the baptism
[1:26:53] of
[1:26:54] John but when Paul come to them he
[1:26:57] showed them that the prophet was dead
[1:26:59] and that Jesus had come and fulfilled
[1:27:01] his life as a sacrifice for sin and that
[1:27:03] now the Holy Ghost was come and would
[1:27:06] enter in and fill all the True Believers
[1:27:08] in Jesus the Messiah when they heard
[1:27:10] this they were baptized in the name of
[1:27:12] the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid
[1:27:14] his hands upon them they were all filled
[1:27:18] with the Holy Ghost they knew what it
[1:27:20] was to obey the word
[1:27:22] to be baptized in His Name Lord Jesus
[1:27:26] Christ and in that way they knew they
[1:27:29] would be filled with the Holy Spirit you
[1:27:32] could not get that people to change they
[1:27:34] knew the truth Acts 19 And1 they knew
[1:27:38] the power of that name they saw the name
[1:27:41] was so powerful that even aprons taken
[1:27:43] from the body of Paul and sent in Jesus
[1:27:46] name to suffering people could deliver
[1:27:48] the sick from all manner of diseases and
[1:27:50] cast out evil spirits
[1:27:53] so manifestly wonderful did the name
[1:27:56] perform the repeate Jews at Ephesus
[1:27:58] attempted to use it to uh to exercise
[1:28:02] devils and Acts 19 And1 and God wrought
[1:28:06] special Miracles by the hand of Paul
[1:28:08] hands of Paul so that from his body were
[1:28:11] taken under this sick handkerchiefs and
[1:28:14] aprons and diseases departed from them
[1:28:17] and evil spirits went out of them then
[1:28:20] certain of the Vagabond Jews and
[1:28:22] Exorcist took upon them to call over
[1:28:25] them which had the evil spirits the name
[1:28:27] of the Lord Jesus saying we ad jur thee
[1:28:30] by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there
[1:28:33] were seven sons of of onekea a Jew a
[1:28:37] chief of the priest which which did so
[1:28:41] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:28:43] Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are
[1:28:47] you and the man in whom the evil spirit
[1:28:50] was was leaped on them and overcome them
[1:28:53] and prevailed against them so that they
[1:28:56] fled out of that house house naked and
[1:28:58] wounded this was known to all the Jews
[1:29:00] and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus and
[1:29:03] fear fell on them all and the name of
[1:29:05] the Lord Jesus was magnified can you say
[1:29:10] amen amen so we want to we we want to
[1:29:13] have we we want to have that that life
[1:29:17] within us can you say amen amen now
[1:29:21] let's let's read uh uh uh are we doing
[1:29:24] all right am I read reading too much all
[1:29:27] right well let's let's go ahead and
[1:29:28] let's let's let's cover some more
[1:29:29] territory here this is this is
[1:29:33] wonderful praise the
[1:29:37] Lord amen they they knew the righteous
[1:29:41] life that accompanied the bearing of
[1:29:44] that name for whosoever nameth the name
[1:29:47] of the Lord let him depart from sin be
[1:29:50] ye holy ye that bear the vessels of the
[1:29:54] Lord Thou shalt not bear the name of the
[1:29:57] Lord thy God in vain these Ephesians
[1:30:00] were
[1:30:01] Christians they bore a name that name
[1:30:04] was Christ who was who was uh the spirit
[1:30:08] of God within them which was one of the
[1:30:11] three-fold names of their lord and for
[1:30:14] not my for my name sake uh Hast labored
[1:30:19] and Hast not fainted these believers
[1:30:22] were laboring for Paul were uh weren't
[1:30:24] laboring for Paul or for any
[1:30:27] organizations they weren't committed to
[1:30:29] programs institutions whereby they built
[1:30:32] up Holdings of value they worked for the
[1:30:35] Lord they were his servants not the pwn
[1:30:38] of
[1:30:38] organizations they didn't go to church
[1:30:40] on Sunday and talk about that name and
[1:30:43] then forget about it the rest of the
[1:30:44] week they didn't give lift surface to
[1:30:47] that name no sir it was their lives that
[1:30:50] were given all they did they did in the
[1:30:53] name in that name in that name they
[1:30:55] acted and if they could not act in that
[1:30:58] name then they refrained from acting
[1:31:01] they were Heavenly placed Christians
[1:31:04] whose Behavior was in their lord now I'm
[1:31:06] going to read that to you again these
[1:31:08] were Heavenly placed Christians whose
[1:31:12] Behavior was in the Lord but that false
[1:31:15] group that false Vine group wanted to
[1:31:17] defile that name and they hung like
[1:31:20] suling wolves in the dark waiting to get
[1:31:23] in and tear down but the Saints stood
[1:31:27] the test kept the word and in uh and the
[1:31:32] name Revelations this is the complaint
[1:31:35] of God Revelations 2 and 4 nevertheless
[1:31:38] I have somewhat against thee because
[1:31:40] thou Hast left thy First Love now we
[1:31:43] went over some of this the other night
[1:31:45] um but I don't think that we read um
[1:31:48] much of this here so I'm going to go
[1:31:50] ahead and read uh do you all have any of
[1:31:53] this marked up in your books so maybe we
[1:31:55] didn't read this
[1:32:00] part yes okay okay so we so we we done
[1:32:05] that last
[1:32:09] week okay all right you know if we did
[1:32:15] um um it it would save us some time if
[1:32:20] if we went through that um cuz I my deal
[1:32:23] is I want to get to the nians tonight if
[1:32:25] we can I want to I want to hit I want to
[1:32:27] at least get into the nicians and um um
[1:32:31] and and so I want I want a few minutes
[1:32:33] for that um let's read a little bit of
[1:32:36] it and then um it says nevertheless I
[1:32:40] have somewhat against you because you
[1:32:41] left your first love to understand this
[1:32:43] you must realize the spirit is not
[1:32:45] speaking to the original Saints of
[1:32:46] Ephesus alone this message is to the
[1:32:49] entire age which lasted 120 years years
[1:32:52] his message then is to all generations
[1:32:55] in that
[1:32:56] span Now history keeps repeating itself
[1:32:59] in the generations of Israel we see
[1:33:01] Revival in one generation only to see
[1:33:03] the fires fading in the next in the
[1:33:06] third Generations yes I'm glad we're
[1:33:08] reading this in the third generation
[1:33:10] Embers may be glowing slightly but in
[1:33:13] the fourth there may not there may be no
[1:33:17] vestage uh whatsoever of that original
[1:33:20] Flame then God lights the fire again and
[1:33:23] the same process is repeated it's simply
[1:33:27] the manifestation of the truth that God
[1:33:30] has no
[1:33:31] grandchildren salvation is not passed on
[1:33:34] by natural birth anymore than is there
[1:33:37] any truth to Apostolic secession it
[1:33:40] isn't in the word you start out with
[1:33:43] truly boring again Believers and the
[1:33:44] Next Generation comes along and they are
[1:33:47] no longer just plain Christians but they
[1:33:49] have taken a denominational name and
[1:33:51] they're now Baptist methodists and I
[1:33:54] want to add message
[1:33:57] Believers Etc that that is exactly what
[1:34:01] they are too they're not Christians they
[1:34:03] have to be born of the will of God not
[1:34:07] the will of man to be saved but these
[1:34:10] folks are all coming together now by the
[1:34:13] will of man I don't say that some of
[1:34:15] them aren't right with God not for a
[1:34:17] minute do I say that but the original
[1:34:20] fire has died down and they are not the
[1:34:23] same anymore the fervent desire to
[1:34:25] please God the passion to know his word
[1:34:28] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[1:34:30] all begins to fade and instead of the
[1:34:33] church being on fire with God it has
[1:34:35] cooled off and become a bit
[1:34:37] formal and that's what was happening
[1:34:39] back to the Ephesians they were getting
[1:34:42] a bit formal the abandonment to God was
[1:34:44] dying out the people weren't too careful
[1:34:47] about what God thought of them as they
[1:34:50] begin to as as they begin to be careful
[1:34:52] about what the world thought of them
[1:34:54] that second generation coming on was
[1:34:56] just like Israel they demanded a king to
[1:34:59] be like the other nations and when they
[1:35:01] did that they rejected God but they did
[1:35:04] it anyway that is the history of the
[1:35:07] church when it thinks more of conforming
[1:35:10] to the world instead of conforming to
[1:35:12] God it isn't long until you see them
[1:35:15] stop doing things they used to do and
[1:35:17] start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:35:19] initially they changed the manner of
[1:35:22] dress their attitudes their behavior
[1:35:26] they get LAX that is what Ephesus means
[1:35:30] relaxed
[1:35:31] drifting the cycle of Revival and death
[1:35:34] has never failed all you have to do is
[1:35:36] recall the last move of God in the
[1:35:38] spirit uh uh move of God in the spirit
[1:35:40] when men and women dressed like
[1:35:42] Christians went to church prayed all
[1:35:45] night took to the street corners weren't
[1:35:47] ashamed of the manifestations of the
[1:35:49] spirit they left the cold the old dead
[1:35:52] churches worshiped in homes and
[1:35:55] storefronts or or in in Old store
[1:35:58] buildings they had reality but it wasn't
[1:36:00] too long a time until they begin to get
[1:36:03] cold enough or get enough money to build
[1:36:07] fine new churches and they put in a
[1:36:10] choir instead of singing unto God for
[1:36:12] themselves they put gowns on the choir
[1:36:14] they organized a movement and ran it by
[1:36:16] man they soon began to read books that
[1:36:20] weren't fit to read they let down the
[1:36:22] bars and the goats come in and took over
[1:36:24] the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of
[1:36:26] the spirit was gone oh they kept on with
[1:36:29] the form but the fire had died down and
[1:36:31] the Blackness of the ashes is all is
[1:36:34] about all that is left now
[1:36:37] brother
[1:36:39] this this last page and a half that we
[1:36:42] just
[1:36:43] read is so
[1:36:48] important I remember when I I had to
[1:36:52] have something in my heart I was in
[1:36:55] Pentecost I was looking for something I
[1:36:58] was searching I I needed
[1:37:06] something you you take you take people
[1:37:08] that that were out there that came out
[1:37:11] of uh uh sin so bad when God touched
[1:37:15] them they had to have a
[1:37:20] change the danger is you kids you kids
[1:37:24] sitting here in in and raised up in
[1:37:28] church you can you can get content and
[1:37:32] say I'm a Christian because I believe in
[1:37:34] a
[1:37:35] prophet I'm a Christian because I you've
[1:37:38] got to have you were born Sinners you
[1:37:42] you you your mom and dad might be
[1:37:45] Christians but you're still born a
[1:37:47] sinner your mom and dad ain't teaching

[1:40:36] that that that one of the the signs of
[1:40:38] the Holy Ghost is it is a crying and
[1:40:40] sighing for the sin that is done in the
[1:40:43] city amen I tell you talking to a little

[1:41:21] us and but all of our dates we were all
[1:41:23] over the hills of kinwood talking to
[1:41:26] somebody else about Jesus and we'd go we
[1:41:28] wanted to

[1:41:38] middle of them and just tell them the

[1:41:42] you we had you know that stupid
[1:41:49] yes but I did WI some
[1:41:51] Souls stupid was coming to paon e at 19
[1:41:55] years old stupid amen just insane coming
[1:41:59] over here and trying to to win souls to
[1:42:01] the Lord but I wanted to do something
[1:42:05] for the Lord you know what I mean I want
[1:42:09] that kind of a fire in me I I I I didn't
[1:42:12] have to have it I didn't have it I
[1:42:14] didn't have a pull pit to preach from
[1:42:16] all the time I had something here to see
[1:42:20] today message message preachers just
[1:42:22] think you know when they when they get a
[1:42:24] call to preach well they they know
[1:42:26] nothing about going out wi and SS and
[1:42:28] preaching to the lost that's well they
[1:42:30] think man just hey hey I've got a gift
[1:42:32] in my life now now let me preach well
[1:42:35] that's not the way the apostles none of
[1:42:37] them done it that way and that's not the
[1:42:39] way that I've done it I went out finding
[1:42:42] souls to save amen yeah come on and and
[1:42:47] I and I think we we missed the point
[1:42:51] when
[1:42:52] we don't have that burning cry in our
[1:42:56] heart to make this message real to
[1:42:59] others now you're not going to quote
[1:43:00] brother brandham brother brandham said
[1:43:01] this brother brandham said that well the
[1:43:03] prophet said no that ain't it brother
[1:43:05] brandham took you right back to here and
[1:43:07] if there's anyone that has a right to be
[1:43:08] able to share this with the lost and
[1:43:10] Dying World we have that
[1:43:13] right amen I think they need to hear
[1:43:16] from somebody that's genuine True
[1:43:19] Believers in the Bible that you can that
[1:43:21] you can say I know it's real I know I've
[1:43:25] experienced it for myself that's what we
[1:43:28] want we want that fire can I hear it
[1:43:31] amen and I want you kids to have that
[1:43:34] amen it's good play music appreciate
[1:43:36] that good to lead songs appreciate that
[1:43:38] it's it's good to help out like you guys
[1:43:40] have done those are we we've got
[1:43:43] servant-hearted people but I'm here to
[1:43:45] tell you if you get the anointing of the
[1:43:48] Holy Ghost in your life God will God
[1:43:51] will shake this town he can shake a
[1:43:54] world through through your life you
[1:43:56] believe that all right let's continue
[1:43:59] reading amen a a few moments ago I
[1:44:01] mentioned that John understood what it
[1:44:03] was to love God the great Apostle of
[1:44:06] Love would certainly see see it when the
[1:44:08] church began to lose the first love of
[1:44:10] God that first love of God in 1 John 5
[1:44:13] and3 he said for this is the love of God
[1:44:16] that we keep his Commandments one little
[1:44:18] deviation from that word was a step away
[1:44:20] from Christ people say they love God
[1:44:23] they go to church they even shout and
[1:44:26] rejoice and sing and have a great
[1:44:28] emotional time but when it is all over
[1:44:32] watch and see if they are in that word
[1:44:35] walking in it living in it if they go
[1:44:39] through all the other and then don't
[1:44:41] walk in that word they can say they love
[1:44:44] God but their lives tell another story I
[1:44:49] wonder if John didn't see a lot of that
[1:44:52] before he died people saying they loved
[1:44:54] God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian
[1:44:57] Church something is happening to you
[1:45:00] someone is trying to either add to that
[1:45:03] word or take from it but they are doing
[1:45:06] it so subtly that you can't see it they
[1:45:09] have made a move they they haven't made
[1:45:13] a move so big you can see it out there
[1:45:15] in the open it is under the cover they
[1:45:18] are bringing in bringing it by way of
[1:45:21] reason and human understanding and it
[1:45:23] will take over unless you refuse it go
[1:45:26] back to Pentecost before it's too late
[1:45:29] but as usual people don't take God's
[1:45:31] warning that Revival fire built upon the
[1:45:34] sacred word and is so wonderful and the
[1:45:36] manifestations of the spirit so blessed
[1:45:38] that a little fear Creeps in and a
[1:45:40] whisper in the heart says how can we
[1:45:42] protect this truth we have what can we
[1:45:45] do to see this revival goes on that is
[1:45:48] when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and
[1:45:49] Whispers look you have the truth now see
[1:45:54] that it doesn't get lost organize set up
[1:45:58] your Creed on what you believe put it in
[1:46:00] a church manual and they do it they
[1:46:03] organize they add to the word they die
[1:46:06] just like Eve did for taking one wrong
[1:46:09] word it's God's word that brings life
[1:46:14] it's not what we say about it that
[1:46:17] counts it's what God Said Amen
[1:46:21] can you say Amen why has this why is
[1:46:25] there so many in the in the message
[1:46:27] ranks that have that have H just just
[1:46:31] let the fire of God die down why is it
[1:46:35] that uh you know I I remember George
[1:46:38] Smith U preaching on the gifts of the
[1:46:41] Spirit and how how ironic when when he
[1:46:43] was over there helping the brandom
[1:46:44] Tabernacle out and he was he was going
[1:46:47] through the very Basics and going
[1:46:49] through and how the gifts of the spirit
[1:46:52] and I thought it was so ironic as I
[1:46:54] asked how how's that going you know and
[1:46:57] and it was it was it was it was quite
[1:47:00] interesting and I thought now brother
[1:47:02] brandham was
[1:47:04] gone a prophet that had such Divine gift
[1:47:08] and moving of God in that exact
[1:47:11] building and the generation that was in
[1:47:14] there knows nothing about
[1:47:17] it they know all about this
[1:47:21] God's not wanting it like that God's not
[1:47:26] organized God's not
[1:47:28] organized his holy spirit is in his
[1:47:32] word the prophet came to bring us back
[1:47:36] to life amen so we're not taking the
[1:47:39] words and saying yes I'm a message
[1:47:41] believer you Baptist you know but I'm
[1:47:44] this
[1:47:46] no no it's God living in a body
[1:47:53] am we should expect him to be with us
[1:47:56] can you say amen I want that same
[1:47:58] fervent I am not satisfied with with
[1:48:01] just saying I'm a message believer and
[1:48:03] the Holy Spirit that was in that Prophet
[1:48:05] amen crying out for souls and crying out
[1:48:08] to be right brother brand you could hear
[1:48:10] it in him he he he his own self I must
[1:48:13] be
[1:48:16] right I want that same God in Me saying
[1:48:20] I must be right can you say Amen how
[1:48:25] many wants to get it right I want to get
[1:48:27] it right yes amen now all right let's
[1:48:32] see uh w're okay we're getting
[1:48:36] late let let's let's I I want I want to
[1:48:41] get let let's read let's read a few more
[1:48:44] and then uh we're almost to the seat of
[1:48:47] nanism and then we'll we'll start there
[1:48:49] again next week we it's the warning of
[1:48:52] God Revelations 2 and5 remember
[1:48:54] therefore from whence Thou Art fallen
[1:48:56] and repent and do the first works or
[1:48:59] else I will come unto thee and will
[1:49:02] remove the Candlestick out of his place
[1:49:04] except thou repent God tells them re
[1:49:06] remember evidently something had left in
[1:49:09] their minds they had forgotten
[1:49:11] something he told them to turn back in
[1:49:14] their minds to their porn of origin the
[1:49:17] origin was the first a of the of the
[1:49:20] first age was
[1:49:22] Pentecost they had fallen from it they
[1:49:25] had forgotten the glory and wonder of it
[1:49:27] it was time to go back in mind and then
[1:49:29] in reality back to when they could say
[1:49:33] for me to live as Christ back to the
[1:49:36] Purity when ananas and safaris were
[1:49:39] dealt with back to the gate beautiful oh
[1:49:43] what a reproach it is to drift from God
[1:49:47] and and countenance those out uh uh from
[1:49:52] God in countenance those acts that
[1:49:54] defile his name let let those who name
[1:49:59] his his name depart from sin and keep
[1:50:02] their vessels pure for God look at what
[1:50:05] you want were in your mind and heart and
[1:50:07] your life then go back to it what is it
[1:50:11] what is the way back the way is
[1:50:14] repentance if a sinner has to come to
[1:50:16] God by a way of repentance then a
[1:50:18] lukewarm or back slider will have to
[1:50:21] repent that much more repent bring forth
[1:50:25] fruits meat for repentance prove it by
[1:50:28] your life if you do not repent said God
[1:50:31] I will remove your lampstand certainly a
[1:50:34] church in that condition can't give
[1:50:36] light to the world its light has turned
[1:50:39] to Darkness God then will take away his
[1:50:42] faithful messenger and his and its
[1:50:44] faithful Shepherds and leave them to
[1:50:46] themselves they will go walking or they
[1:50:49] will go on talking about about
[1:50:50] Christianity but be re uh be berried of
[1:50:53] it repent quickly don't hesitate
[1:50:56] evidently Ephesus did hesitate for her
[1:50:59] lifespan was not very long the glory of
[1:51:02] God deceased or or decreased ever so
[1:51:05] rapidly it was not long until the city
[1:51:07] was in
[1:51:08] Ruins its glorious Temple became a
[1:51:11] shapeless Mass the land become Marsh
[1:51:15] inhabited by water file the population
[1:51:18] was gone except for a few unbelievers in
[1:51:20] a squalled village there was not even
[1:51:23] one Christian left the lamp was rent
[1:51:26] from its place now it does not mean that
[1:51:29] she could not have repented it does not
[1:51:31] mean that we cannot repent we can but it
[1:51:36] must be quickly we must be a true it
[1:51:40] must be a true heart CED to God in
[1:51:43] sorrow and then God will restore and the
[1:51:46] glory will come again aren't you glad
[1:51:49] for that
[1:51:50] if you have if you're finding yourself
[1:51:53] if if if even on these Wednesday nights
[1:51:55] and and and and you're hearing some of
[1:51:57] these things and it's and it's and it's
[1:51:59] and it's hitting your soul God's saying
[1:52:02] hey I i' I've got my blood for you can

[1:52:11] praise the Lord amen so we're thankful
[1:52:15] for that now we we we we did not we made
[1:52:18] it up to the seed of n
[1:52:21] leonism and we will go from there on
[1:52:24] next Wednesday are y'all enjoying these
[1:52:25] Wednesday
[1:52:26] nights
[1:52:31] amen now the these
[1:52:34] uh and and brother Brandon would tell us
[1:52:38] okay so so here is here is
[1:52:41] Ephesus then you've got the second age
[1:52:44] you've got the third age he said now
[1:52:45] what started out here as
[1:52:48] Deeds
[1:52:52] then they become sayings over here that
[1:52:55] you you've got you've got some of those
[1:52:57] that were that that were of the uh in
[1:53:00] the second Church age the synagogue of
[1:53:02] Satan we've got this right in here by
[1:53:05] the time you get over here it is now the
[1:53:11] doctrine of uh the
[1:53:18] nicians it's the doctrine of the nicians
[1:53:22] by the time you get to this third Church
[1:53:24] age they it is now called the seat of
[1:53:28] Satan now now now catch that by the time
[1:53:32] we get up to
[1:53:34] here ain't nothing left nothing no more
[1:53:38] so so brother Bradon would tell us and
[1:53:41] he's and he's going in and as you're
[1:53:43] reading uh and I I really read let's
[1:53:46] let's comb over that that uh this church
[1:53:48] age book I really like for y'all to do
[1:53:50] that and not just not not just wait on
[1:53:53] me to read let's let's let's really uh
[1:53:55] uh pray over over this but but you'll
[1:53:58] notice there if you if you're looking at
[1:53:59] that 93rd uh the 93rd
[1:54:03] page uh he says how it started out it's
[1:54:05] called the Deeds then it become a
[1:54:07] Doctrine it become the standard it
[1:54:10] become the unbending way so Satan was
[1:54:13] coming in with the
[1:54:14] deeds and then it become the
[1:54:18] doctrine then it become the
[1:54:20] standard what it is is Satan wants to
[1:54:23] plant the
[1:54:24] seeds make you think you're
[1:54:27] okay and then before you know it then
[1:54:31] then you start teaching it then you
[1:54:33] start saying you know well you know but
[1:54:36] that see and then it's the unbending
[1:54:39] way what we want to do is let this be
[1:54:43] the
[1:54:43] seed let this come as the doctrine and
[1:54:47] let this be the unbending way amen amen
[1:54:52] if the musicians would come any any
[1:54:54] question mark or or any any any
[1:54:56] questions here
[1:54:58] tonight praise the
[1:55:07] Lord no
[1:55:10] questions
[1:55:15] hallelujah
[1:55:18] amen
[1:55:21] all
[1:55:22] right there a there there is no stupid
[1:55:25] questions at
[1:55:27] all always feel free to open up on these
[1:55:30] Wednesday nights you're always welcome
[1:55:33] we're sort of taking our time for a
[1:55:34] purpose and that because um what you
[1:55:38] might think is so stupid there's there
[1:55:41] there there could be about 95% of
[1:55:44] everyone else thinking the same thing so
[1:55:45] just ask it and we'll all go woo you're
[1:55:48] stupid but I'm sure glad you asked
[1:55:57] amen oh go
[1:56:07] ahead
[1:56:09] well the the that is a good question
[1:56:13] because as brother brandham will get
[1:56:15] into it what they they had received the
[1:56:18] glory there was first of all the false
[1:56:21] Vine is absolutely of the
[1:56:24] devil and the True Vine is this is the
[1:56:27] spirit of God but they're living off
[1:56:30] that same life of that early church and
[1:56:33] so um and brother Brandon will will be
[1:56:36] going in through that like Judas Judas
[1:56:40] had had the gifts of the Spirit and and
[1:56:42] that is going to be coming up so that
[1:56:45] false
[1:56:47] Vine did was able ble to perform some
[1:56:50] Miracles was able and and but as they
[1:56:53] begin to grow and and come through then
[1:56:56] we begin then we find but their nature
[1:56:59] was against the word so at the beginning
[1:57:01] they looked a lot alike except they just
[1:57:04] had a different take than what the
[1:57:07] others believed of the Apostle Paul I
[1:57:08] personally believe that they were saying
[1:57:11] they were they were looking and and and
[1:57:12] saying well that's the way you see it
[1:57:16] but we sort of believe you know I we
[1:57:18] think the Apostle Paul man this way and
[1:57:20] then and and and before you know it you
[1:57:24] know that's where you got your two two
[1:57:27] two different opinions was that what she
[1:57:28] was asking or
[1:57:31] no because when you're when when they're
[1:57:34] first coming they they're they're both
[1:57:36] Blades of grass and they both
[1:57:39] but then it becomes just a uh you you
[1:57:43] through those Dark Ages then you begin
[1:57:44] to find whoa whoa
[1:57:47] whoa and the nickan spirit is is to
[1:57:50] conquer the Ley
[1:57:52] it's
[1:57:53] it it's as brother Brandon would say
[1:57:56] it's the seed of
[1:57:57] ruination and men and and and and
[1:58:01] basically what it is it was just okay it
[1:58:03] would be like it would be like here in
[1:58:05] our church it would be
[1:58:07] like it would be like
[1:58:10] us the deacons and the and trustees and
[1:58:15] and US preachers all getting together
[1:58:17] and devising a plan
[1:58:20] you know making it a more of a business
[1:58:22] and and and and trying
[1:58:25] to uh it it and and that's basically
[1:58:28] what they were trying to
[1:58:30] do they the Catholic Church came in with
[1:58:33] they found way to make
[1:58:36] money and they were and the people gave
[1:58:39] all of the power to a few a few men and
[1:58:45] um and those men and were not holding
[1:58:48] those men accountable to the word of God
[1:58:52] and so when you do
[1:58:54] that you just got the
[1:58:56] blind following the blind so what we so
[1:59:01] it's it is so important for every one of
[1:59:03] us and and and I've got I've got some
[1:59:05] quotes in my 59 notes pages of notes
[1:59:08] here where where where brother brandham
[1:59:10] says the church ends up a business it's
[1:59:13] a it's a major
[1:59:15] business
[1:59:16] and and so you you appreciate appreciate
[1:59:20] you you appreciate brother brandom in
[1:59:22] this age staying so far away from the
[1:59:25] money aspect of it so that he could we
[1:59:28] could keep our eyes upon the tress of
[1:59:32] the gift that God put in his life it's
[1:59:34] we're we're so brother if you don't see
[1:59:37] Calvary through this
[1:59:41] message I know they want to pick on him
[1:59:44] I know they want to pick on brother
[1:59:45] brandom this that they're just a bunch
[1:59:47] of bozos
[1:59:50] you take any you take any man and you
[1:59:54] you you you you any any any man that is
[1:59:57] willing to look at what brother brandham
[2:00:00] taught and look at it through the
[2:00:02] scripture you can't help but see exactly
[2:00:06] what the spirit of the Lord was trying
[2:00:07] to tell us that's right I'm thankful for

[2:01:58] or two where brother bradam says now now
[2:02:03] to say that he says the
[2:02:06] elect cannot be
[2:02:08] deceived because the nature of the seed
[2:02:13] can only agree with the word that's
[2:02:15] right and so it's not that we've got a
[2:02:18] critical spirit
[2:02:20] criticizing this or that or criticizing
