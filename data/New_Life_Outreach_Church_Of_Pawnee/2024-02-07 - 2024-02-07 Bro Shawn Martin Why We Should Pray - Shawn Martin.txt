um uh more than that I just appreciate his love for the Lord and this message and and uh certainly means uh a lot to me and uh uh to the bride of Christ around the world Amen y'all truly are blessed Amen to to have a Ministry amen that that is standing for the message amen and uh you know there a lot of shaking going on in the land today and uh but um there's true true men of God that stand true to the word of God Amen and certainly love my dad and mom and uh glad to see he's doing well amen and uh but the church in in blackburg ask me to greet you all amen and uh looking forward to uh our meetings coming up up and uh trusting um trusting y'all's got a bus and ready to go and come up and see us praise the Lord okay let's get in the word uh the book of uh first Thessalonians the uh 5th chapter praise the Lord amen amen uh 1 Thessalonians uh chapter 5 and before we uh go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord no doubt there are needs here that are present and we certainly know our Lord can meet them amen father truly it is an honor to be here with your people here in py and father to to see that their hearts are one with you and they're standing true to you to the message that you've sent father I pray that you would just bless them bless brother Wendell sister Fresco Lord and and their Endeavors father and I I just pray Lord that you would bless the ministering of your word as well is the hearing father for without you we're nothing Lord and it just takes you to come Among Us and work a supernatural work and may you feel welcome here tonight is our prayer and help me just to get myself out of the way we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says am amen and amen 1 Thessalonians the 5th chapter and the 17th verse is just very short but it says pray without ceasing can you say that with me pray without ceasing then if you'll turn to First Timothy just a book over uh 1 Timothy Chapter 2 and verse 8 and it says I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and outing amen you can uh have your seats this evening and um I guess the the title that I would uh use tonight is is um why we should pray and um it's a uh subject that is quite broad but uh so we won't be able to cover it all this evening but I pray that something will be said to stir uh stare us us up uh to more prayer you know sometimes uh we as the people of God act as though we're helpless when when we have situations that come our way and are backs against the wall and and um we wonder what we're going to do and you know how it's going to work out and yada yada and uh so much nervousness that is going on in the land today but I I don't believe that God has called us out of the world I don't believe that he's called us out of Babylon and uh only for him to remain hidden and unseen to us I believe that if he called you out of unbelief and out of the muck and the M of sin and and these things then he's done it for a purpose as the prophet said and that is to show him himself through you and to you uh and his power ain't that right so since the beginning of time man has has offered prayer unto God and uh you know as it's been said you know that prayer is is certainly important uh to to every believer there's there's not one um of us that we could say well you know I'm we we just don't need prayer every believer uh prayer is important and Satan uh knows the importance of prayer he's not dumb uh he he certainly knows the importance and this is why he he attacks us or fights us uh so hard in our prayer life and because that prayer is important you know to to Mankind we have places that we have design ated uh uh for prayer such as the the house of God this this building uh uh is designated for prayer for Jesus said my house shall be called The House of Prayer not just not the house of worship or not just uh House of just anything but it it it is des designated as the House of Prayer but not only that our home should be a constant place of Prayer amen it it it it should always be a place um uh that we would pray unto God but but not only just the home but anywhere everywhere um uh we believe that God will hear our prayer and uh uh and and we're thankful for that whether you're out in the woods whether you're in your car whether whether uh you know you're in the grocery store whatever God hears prayer do you believe that amen it's not just a designated place but you know Jesus though encourages us to get alone and pray it's one thing to come together as like we are tonight and to pray and and to have or you know uh uh uh congregation comes and and has prayer meetings and things and brother brandom encouraged that of having prayer prayer meetings but here we find in Matthew 6 and6 Jesus says when thou pray EST enter into thy closet and when thou H has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee thee openly amen so then then if if Jesus is telling us that we must spend time alone in prayer you know we we find that the prophet got away uh in hunting uh he hunted a lot and but he says it's not it's not really like what people thought just to go out and get deer or fish or whatever but it was to spend time with God Alone in prayer and I I think that's that's uh that's that that applies to every one of us is finding some time alone the Bible talks of how Jesus went to the mountain alone to pray amen and and you know brother Ram says that when we pray in secret he says there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out see he says we we seem to get in better connection with God When We Get Alone he says that when we're alone we we usually pray different than what we would if we pray it in church amen something about being alone with God that that it it brings a a greater sincerity because now you just you you you you're not and and you just excuse the expression but you're not trying to impress you're you're not uh you know you're not worried about whatever is around you but you can share with God the deepest um the deepest secrets of our hearts and there's sometimes you don't want people to know that you're how just uh helpless you feel or or how lonely you may feel or how desperate you are and afraid of what people will think or what they will say or what they'll do and and yada yada but you get alone with God and you begin to pray amen and brother Bram would tell us the greatest Revelation and inspiration comes when we are alone with God he says if we would take more time to get along with God we would live a better life a more Victorious Life in in Christ so so you you see the the life of a Christian is so different from the life of Just The Sinner or the average Church goer uh because they're they're they're they're so consumed with worldly things and busy life go go go and and trying to meet the demands of the world but but we're not called to meet the demands of the world we're not called to keep up with the Joneses per se we're not called to do these things but but more important we are called to walk with God Alone amen and sometimes s that we may share our our burdens with our spouse we may share with our closest friends and yet they are limited in helping they are limited in being able to relieve the burden but when you go to God In Prayer amen there's something that that happens because God is the one who can work the miraculous so brother brandham taught us that prayer is very essential he said I spend a great part of of my life in prayer amen and he says friends you may laugh too much you may talk too much you may you may walk too much but you will never you'll never pray too much ain't that right so in another place he said you Christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore lay aside everything lay aside everything and just get as close to God as you can walk with him talk with him him can you say amen he says let everything else be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him all the time I hope this is okay just reading quotes here to you but he says every day you're bound to sin and you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes a constant everybody say constant it takes a constant prayer to God Amen you cannot go by yesterday's experience you can't you know if you you got saved 10 years ago a year ago a month ago whatever you cannot go just on off of that experience but you have to be constantly in prayer because we we are backsliding every day and that's what a prophet said can you say amen amen see you may not be smoking the cigarettes you may not be uh uh uh uh the thief or you may not be in in adult or whatever but you're constantly backsliding amen and it's a gradual thing and therefore we have to constantly be in prayer we have to constantly walk with God can you say Amen even Jesus who did not know any sin amen spent much in time in prayer so the prophet says so to stay in Fellowship now think of it to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him see Jesus spent much time in prayer so to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him amen we don't want to be people that claim to have the Holy Ghost and yet be strangers to the very God that lives within us amen amen the Holy Ghost is not a myth the Holy Ghost amen is a literal person it is the person of God living inside of you amen deity is not in heaven deity is in you but prayer takes it to where we're in constant fellowship with the god that lives within us can you say amen and if Jesus had to do that then what about us ain't that right so prayer is the way of Believers and and this is why you should never never be yolked up with unbelievers amen the Bible talks about King Jehoshaphat and and who was a righteous man but he had joined up with with Ahab who was a make believer and and a lukewarm and and and we of course we all know what a lukewarm believer is it's it's actually just an unbeliever in Disguise amen but but uh uh Ahab was uh he he convinced Jehoshaphat uh uh uh to do a certain thing without consulting the Lord first and and we found out that Jehoshaphat got himself into trouble because he did not he did not consult the Lord so the prophet said see now ordinarily Jehoshaphat would have prayed over the subject would have thought about it first and said God what must I do but being yolked up with unbelievers he took the unbelievers way ain't that right see and and so what is the unbelievers way doing things without consulting God first Jehoshaphat would have prayed about it but he yoked himself up with the unbeliever and took the way of the unbeliever you'll always wind up getting yourself in trouble if you don't pray can you say amen amen see and so therefore he said that's the way many Spirit-filled Christians after Revival Falls because they they they yoke themselves up amongst people that say well I go to church we're just as good as the rest of them and you lose your experience can you sayen church we don't want to lose our experience we must stay in Revival constantly brother brandham said never let the spirit of Revival die can you say Amen see and so this message gives us a remedy there's a formula for us to stay in Revival I don't believe that you have to stay in a mess's church and die amen and and your experience just wither amen your pastor could be preaching fine sermons amen but it will never affect you in a positive light except you have fellowship with God you've got to stay in Fellowship just as much as the pastor has to stay in fellowship and parents have to stay in Fellowship every one of us has to stay in fellowship with God through prayer can you say Amen so he says you lose your experience so stay right in the road no matter what the rest of them does you know where you belong you know who you belong to so stay right under the power of prayer all the time don't let them call you off to something else in amusements and so forth and saying oh there's no harm in this if there's a question don't do it stay away from it can you say Amen so he warns us to to stay under the power of prayer all the the time amen see I I thought of how that Jehoshaphat amen here they were in trouble and yet Jehosaphat remembered that there was a prophet in the land he remembered that there was a man as uh uh uh uh Elisha that that was close by and the prophet said he had heard that Elisha poured water on the hands of Elijah amen the real prophet of God and and and and and the prophet said see Jehoshaphat knew then that that if if Elisha poured water on the hands of of the Prophet Elijah then uh uh he had to have dealings uh with the real Prophet ain't that right well I thought of that because Elisha the prophet said is the type of the Church of the bride of Christ today ain't that right amen see and and so then then if if Jehosaphat knew that if elishah had to have some had something to do with Elijah then he must have the word of God he he's he he he wouldn't go to the school of prophets he wouldn't go to anyone else because this man Elisha had dealings with that Prophet Elijah amen see he had poured water on his hands you know the the Bible or or we the the I guess the proverb is is birds of a feather flock together right amen and and you your your your acquaintances identify who you are well there was something that identified Elisha Amen to Jehoshaphat and that was he was connected with the prophet of God can you say Amen now the prophet said this how can you expect anybody to believe you when you're running around and acting the way you do and then come in and call yourselves Christians no wonder they don't call for you to come and pray for them and so forth see amen but but see uh uh even though Elijah was gone there was a man that had followed that prophet's message amen and had received a double portion of his Spirit can you say amen and they went to him for the answer and I I'll just say it this way by us pouring water on this message identifies us amen that the word is truly with the bride of Jesus Christ can you sayen see we're we're Associated brother Bram said show me your company I'll tell you who you are ain't that right well you say well how are we pouring water well brother Braham said by our Praises we we pour water amen by our Praises ain't that right so he says just like this take God's word for it and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the word to Life As We water it with praises see what makes makes the seed grow water see what makes the word of God grow is the Praises of God and he said if you'll take any Divine promise of God made in his Bible put it in your heart water it every day with the Praises of God then it's going to come to pass because it's going to grow can you say amen amen so you're not sitting there complaining about the message you're not sitting there dissecting the message amen because then there's no power with that it doesn't show that you're acquainted with the message but you get a people that pours the water on the message by their praises and simply just believing God praising God Amen it identifies that they have the word of God they have the power of God and that's what identified Elisha Amen to Jehoshaphat he had poured water on the hands of Elijah he was acquainted with Elijah can you say amen amen yes sir and I I have to say it this way even though our Prophet has gone the power of God is not left there are some people that are acquainted with the prophet of this hour I may have not been able to walk and see him in a personal uh way but I believe the message of the hour can you say amen and the word is in the bride of Christ today so we water the word the message with our praises and it's proof that we are associated with it amen see amen you love the Lord amen see so the prophet said see the sick and the sin and sinful world today is looking to a real Church of the Living God who possesses a double portion of his spirit amen they possess they're looking for someone that is possessed with uh uh possesses the uh double portion of his Spirit ain't that right so prayer is how we St stay connected with God just getting back to my subject here amen so we want to stay under the power of prayer and not let anyone anything distract us I don't care how what your situation is I don't care how bad it would seem I don't care all of these things don't you let nothing pull you away amen out of the power of prayer amen well why should Believers pray well as we said it it's it's it's a common uh uh uh statement there's power in prayer how many believes that amen there's power in prayer brother BR said see Prayer Changes Things prayer changes death to life prayer changes sickness to health changes Sinners to Saints it's prayer now see I cannot change it as a man you cannot change it as a as a human being can you say Amen but prayer is what changes things amen you and talk till you blew in the face amen and it still doesn't seem to uh uh uh uh solve the situation but prayer will change every situation do you believe that see prayer is the greatest weapon known to man amen there are times you know when when it's easy to get down and and uh uh uh pray and then there's times that it's not so easy to get down and pray and and and and you know we we find ourselves coming up with all kinds of excuses as well we we overslept we got to get going we got to get the day going and and and to be honest I'm I'm I'm I'm there as well I'm guilty uh uh but we allow things and all of a sudden everything starts controlling us us can you say amen and and and and yet the world is not to control us situations are not to control us we are to control every situation you believe that now we're we're Sons and Daughters of God are we not we're Kings and Priests are we not we are rulers in this world Amen we talk about being gods me amateur gods and and all of these things well then it's time that we quit letting the situations rule us rule our attitude rule our temperament rule our atmosphere rule we are Gods miniature Gods amateur God sons of God that are to rule amen the situation amen see and so but we come up with all kinds of excuses and our excuses have us actually believing that that we cannot pray and that we are helpless and and and and and and we don't know what to do and and all of these things and you know what Satan is the one God never supplies you with them type of excuses amen it's the devil that supplies you with all kinds of excuses can you say Amen but there's a reason as why he does it for the prophet said prayer is the greatest weapon can you say that with me prayer is the greatest weapon in the world Amen prayer is the greatest weapon in the world do you believe that amen we read in the Bible you know brother Bram talked a lot about the Old Testament Saints and you know and he used them quite often of of you know talking of of of how they overcome their enemies and we we read about David over coming uh The Lion and the bear and and Goliath and and and and and he overcome the different powers that come at him amen and he was an overcomer shamard we look at shamard and what he was able to do Samson what he was able to do and and and and uh Moses and and Joshua and and all of these things and and yet these these stories are not to be bedtime stories amen they're they're not f fictitious stories can you say Amen but they are meant to to for us to learn by them and draw strength from them that if a natural people can take a natural weapon under the spirit of God and defeat a natural enemy then God and they were types and shadows of you do you believe that David type of Shadow a you shamard and and anyone all the saints of old that defeated their enemy amen God knew you were coming and he had it in the Bible put in the Bible story after story after story after Story and they all were telling us that you can do it as well can you say amen amen that's right seed so if the Royal seed they they were a natural Seed of Abraham but we are the Royal Seed of Abraham and the promise was that they that that he told God told Abraham thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy do you believe that he well that's a promise that ain't a might that's a promise hey look look at Samson the secret to Samson's uh uh Victory and his strength was his long hair it was a Nazarite vow unto the Lord nothing could conquer him nothing could imprison him nothing could defeat him nothing could hinder him ain't that right but when the enemy found the secret to his strength and they cut his hair off Samson was like just any Normal Man and the enemy was able to make a slave out of Samson ain't that right well the prophet tells us the secret to our strength is a prayer life amen prayer life everybody say prayer life now think of it it's not just an utterance of words that we pray it is a weapon against any foe that that would come against us it's the greatest weapon ever known to man think of the world that is trembling amen of uh because of the nuclear uh uh Powers uh bombs and uh Atomic and whatever you know and and they're trembling because the world could explode in any moment and and threats and all these things and and and and it it's incredible but to think of the that when you as a Believer get on your knees to pray amen the devil trembles can you say Amen the devil trembles so see if if the enemy is able to take away our prayer life then then we are just the average and I just be honest now we're we're just the average churchgoer amen there there's really not much difference between us and the rest of the world Amen because we we you see the prophet said he gave us is the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that's prayer prayer is what changes things ain't that right see the Christian he says doesn't realize what a force he has when he goes down on his knees okay all right the Christian doesn't know what a force he has when he goes on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he does doesn't realize what power that is there is a power that comes with kneeling before the Lord can you say Amen if the people could only realize what was G is given right unto them anything everybody say anything anything let's say that again anything anything that you ask for anything that you ask for see he says uh uh uh uh will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's word is true ain't that right so prayer prayer moves mountains do you believe that prayer rolls back the Red Seas you believe that it closes the mouths of lions yeah prayer takes the heat out of the fire prayer does Amen I've I've I've wondered you know what what is it you young people when you see uh uh your elders go through a lot of things in their life and and you wonder what makes them keep pressing on what is it we you know well the secret is is prayer amen they can go through the fire a lot of times God doesn't take us out of the fire but he'll take the heat out of the fire amen you see when we Master when we understand the weapon that we have is by prayer then you're not defeated you're not going down a defeated person amen you're going down with the greatest weapon in your hand can you say amen amen prayer is not a some little old thing prayer is the thing that God gave you to defeat the enemy with can you say amen Amen brother BR said there's no greater power no greater power can you say that with me no greater power in the world than prayer now Matthew 21:21 Jesus said all things everybody say all things all things whatsoever you shall ask in in prayer believing you shall receive now God's word is true do you believe that amen see I've thought of uh how that uh we read there in the Bible where Jesus was directed Amen to go somewhere because of somebody was praying Mark uh 4:35 it says and the same day when the even was come he sath unto them let us pass over onto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full ain't that right well there's a reason why he's going to the other side there's a reason why he would say this let's go to the other side why because there was one Soul one soul that needed help one soul that needed him ain't that right amen see and there's a reason why Satan would cause the winds and the waves to try to sink that boat because one Soul can you say Amen was coming to Victory One Soul was getting his deliverance and the one that was going to give him that Deliverance was on his way can you say Amen you see see there's a spiritual warfare a lot of time we don't understand Warfare amen but it's a spiritual warfare a lot of times Satan will try to stop you and you wonder well why is it that's that that chaos is happening in my home why is it that things are just going haywire have you ever just stopped to think of what is going on can you say Amen sure it is see so so here Jesus what did Jesus says okay boys let's give it up let's go well he couldn't do that because he was after one Soul right ain't that right so so we find that Jesus rebukes the wind he was not detoured he he was not bothered he just stood there and rebuked the winds the waves and said peace be still and he continued on ain't that right but now notice who it was that he is after Mark 5 and one and they came over to the other side of the Sea and the country of GAD and when he come out was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chain every man were they they were it it was impossible for them to deal with this individual can you say Amen welfare couldn't help him Church couldn't help him doctor of theology could not help him Society wasn't there was no program that could help him come on can you say amen hallelujah and he had been bound often with feeds and chains and the chains see had been plucked asunder by him and the FEDS broken in pieces neither could any man tame him see this man was demonic this man wasn't just a human he was possessed we're finding more and more people are possessed in this age the lid of hell has been opened up and demons are pouring in that's what the prophet said what we're dealing with is people that are demon possessed let's just face it you can blame your children all you want to but it's the devil trying to wreak havoc come on you can blame your spouse all you want to it's the devil trying to wreak havoc yes sir can you say Amen you can blame the preacher you can blame whoever it's the devil trying to split the church and cause Division and all these things we got to recognize the enemy what do we do just go change church after church after church after church do we change and keep voting the pastor out and getting another pastor and voting another Pastor do we just keep doing whatever it ain't going to change the situation so here it was because he had been bound see and and and and and these chains were plucked asunder by him and the feathers broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones ain't that right but when he saw Jesus a far off he ran and worshiped him now we all know the story amen that that uh uh this man was called Legion for there were many but Jesus delivered that man can you say Amen Jesus was the one that could deliver that man and the man was found in his right mind he was clothed amen that's right but notice what caused Jesus to come after him what would cause Jesus to endure the hardships amen and you know if I could say it this way some sometimes s Ministry is not the greatest thing in the in in the world sometimes there's a lot of challenges with Ministry and and to be honest all of us should be ministers in one way or another you may not be called to the pulpit but but you you Mamas are are the Fifth Gospel in your home hello uh uh well all of us every one of us has some type of a Ministry and Ministry is to serve and and and and so therefore you you you know here Jesus he come to seek and to save those that were lost and and so here he's coming after that one individual and all hell is breaking loose but Jesus did not did not detour him he kept on he kept on right well what would cause him brother Brown said he went over there at the Cry of one person one person he was willing to go through the shipwrecks if if that's what it would be the winds and the temptest and all of these things that was happening he went there for one person and he said one poor Maniac lost his mind perhaps a good man at one time walked uprightly before God but probably got in the wrong crowd Maybe started drinking or something lost his mind he lived out in the tombs where the demons Liv put him in Chains and he had Supernatural Powers he'd break those chains jump on men beat him kill them if he could when they come by and that poor little fell notice now maybe had an old gray-headed mother somewhere praying for him aren't you glad there's a prophet that could go in in in in in there and let us know really what was going on there was a gray-haired mother over there praying for that man that was her boy can you say amen and Jesus crossed the sea all the way over to give Mercy to one man and he will do the same tonight where one humble soul is calling on him he'll cross the Seas leave the Heavens to answer that prayer it's the Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever can you say Amen if it worked for that Mama back then it'll work for today God has never changed a man given his weapons and what weapon he gave us it's always been prayer hallelujah amen we read about zachus in the Bible and how that he was just he was just The Sinner he didn't believe that Jesus was a prophet but he had a Christian wife and re Rebecca right and she was a Christian and she prayed for him and prayed for him she was a follower of Jesus Christ and and and and so she prayed for her husband brother BR said see you know when you get to praying for a fell he kind of gets in a bad shape and if you want somebody saved now notice how he going to say if you want somebody saved don't sit there and Grumble about about it take it to heart sometimes talking to them ain't going to work you're talking to the wrong person you can tell well you need to straighten yourself up when he could look at you and say well I probably would if I could all right can you say Amen ain't it easy that we talk to everybody else about it instead of our God but prayer is talking to the Lord that's where the greatest weapon is I hope this all right so he says if you want somebody saved or something done just start praying for them pray don't neglect prayer it could be dependent on you to pray okay hello how many's got situations you need God to work on well some of us do see prayer you're not helpless there's not one of us that is helpless here now this is fact this is truth good prach good so the night before Jesus came to their Town Rebecca didn't sleep she looked out of the corner of her eye the prophet said and saw zachus and he was all Restless and notice she began to pray Lord I know you're dealing with him I know you're dealing with him why she' been praying and now Jesus the prophet is coming into the town for this meeting down here and I want to see him so bad Lord you make a way now just make him miserable so here here She is she she's she's laying right by by her husband amen and this is the prayer that she's praying for him oh God God you know not not not not make his life okay oh God just just you know no make him miserable make him miserable can you say Amen sometimes you know we we we we got to just pray God make people miserable sometimes he knows how to make us miserable don't he why so we don't get satisfied with where we're at yeah brother can you say Amen so so you know he said see uh uh uh uh make him miserable just make him so he can't sleep what a prayer he can't even know why he's not sleeping and and so there he was he couldn't sleep so all right that's fine so she had dozed off to sleep laying praying all night and he says and if you want your husband safe now you do the same thing Rebecca did just start praying for him ain't that right so he says see you know out there on the sea when he's got there fishing or down there in the business he will get so under conviction he can't even sleep and if you want your wife Sav you do the same thing she'll come away from every card party and everything else she belongs to why there's great power in prayer there's power in prayer now acts 1 and8 Jesus said and you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you so so you know if if if you know we asked I'm sure most of us would say I've got the Holy Ghost and well you know the promise is that when the Holy Ghost would come to you amen then you're going to receive power that word of power is Authority dunamus ain't that right so there's power now and a lot of times the power is not in in our action as much as it is in prayer so so here brother Brown said now you take a a person that's lived a good life but they're always defeated God help us right you take a good person that's lived a good life and and but they're always defeated oh I tell you see I I sure love the Lord Brother brandom but always defeated they never get a prayer answered you fill that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time and watch what takes place when she goes before God she's not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of grace believing see because she has a right because she is a daughter of God by birth can you say Amen so many times we parents can be guilty of trying to pacify our children by by technology in the of the day and appeasing them just to get them out of our hair so to speak or just to get them quietened down we'll put phones or whatever in their way you know and and and and and to be honest that's really a disgrace when we do such things as children of God because we realize that that a lot of times it's a spiritual warfare that's what's going on I thought just like brother Brown talking of of of how when he entered in ma was just you know beside herself and you know gray-haired there and she crying and and all these things and the babies the the children were fighting and and fussing and all these things y'all remember the story see and and brother brandom he didn't say okay guys let's all watch a movie let let's let's get it all together here let's all go out to the movies and let's do this and here's you a phone and here let's go play games and and let's get them all no no what did he do he just hugged his wife and and and and quietly he just began to pray God help me oh God change the situation oh God change the atmosphere can you say Amen why he had greater Authority now I want to be honest with you you don't want technology holding power over your children that's the devil's way of getting to your children right but you got a greater way and that's prayer come on can you say Amen Prayer Changes Things amen amen yes sir so he says see she has a right because she's a daughter of God by a birth take that little man so cowardly that the boss kicks him all over the place say wait a minute here now see something's changed he's got the Holy Ghost see he gives you power hello he gives you power your life now is full of power and your prayer is full of power it has power power because you are a son and daughter of God ain't that right you realize that as redeemed sons of God now I I know this is very simple tonight and but yet I just encourage you amen but as redeemed sons of God you know right now we are above the angels of God yes sir we are for the prophet taught us that that servants uh the angels are servants and yet we are Sons and Daughters of God and he said which is the most thought of your servant or your son or daughter see prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel because he's a son ain't that right see he says see church he said I don't believe this sight of Eternity will how will ever realize what you are the position that you are that God has placed you Spirit-filled people you are Sons you're a son and an angel can only bring you a message but you have to act for you're the actor on the scene praise the Lord can you say Amen you're the son so when do we take authority now when is it time come on when is the time oh when the third pool comes then we'll speak the spoken word oh God when yeah so we just let the devil just have his way with our home yeah our church Our Lives come on and we just talk gloomy Doom doubt yeah but but one day it'll come well you're missing the point that's right you are a son and da son and daughter of God now when will the word take effect you said we said in the church we amen the preacher I hope you listen to tapes at home come on your tapes your home should always have the prophet's voice should never be a stranger to that prophet's voice amen come on but when does it take effect Upon Us hello God sends things our way for us to exercise The Authority oh yeah if I was living in the Bahamas I'd really be good well what about the storms that come your way oh I don't know I just I just don't know how I'm going to make it are you a son or not are you daughter or not is the word true or not is it a fairy tale is it something just we get excited about or is this something that we are to put to practice can you say Amen come on yes sir that's oh Jesus bless the Lord you see you are the one we are the one that was predestinated to be conformed to His Image yes you believe it so Christ never died for Angels no ain't that right and Jesus never told the Angels if you say to this mountain be thou removed and don't doubt in your heart it shall be done he never told that to Angels he told that to Common born men and women boys and girls he gave this promise to his children ain't that right so we are his offspring how many's an offspring of God you an offspring ain't that amazing we're not Baptist we used to identify as a Baptist we used to identify as a Pentecostal we used to identify with all kinds of things but when we come in the message it identified us and helped us to realize we are sons of God I'm a Son of God there was no power in being a Pentecostal there was no power in being a Baptist there was no power in being whatever there's power in being a Son of God ain't that right and God would send us a message amen and that prophet would get into the mind of God and reveal to us that we were in his thinking in the beginning ain't that right and he never thought of us as defeated he never thought of us as as someone that is is burdened down and a vagabon and helpless he always called us an overcomer Victorious yes sir Victorious you believe that Victorious yes ain't that a mean we are part of his godhead you believe it well we're Sons and Daughters of God God above us God With Us God in us and he doesn't just come in just anyone there's a jean seed in here that he has identified with amen he knew them before the foundation of the world yes we are an eternal thought that cannot die that has no ending it can never cease Eternal can never take a break never have time out are you with me now so no matter how low you feel yeah no time out yeah you're still a son and daughter of God no matter how defeated you are and how you feel no time out you're an eternal Gene of God God lives in you whether you like it or not God lives in you whether you feel your prayer are getting to the throne of grace or it's hitting the in the hidden just the roof God still lives in you can you say Amen so then we are to conduct ourselves as sons of God whether you're on the mountain or whether you're in the valley whether you feel God or whether you don't feel God whether you whether you lived made walk made the whole day without making a mistake or or whether you made all kinds of blunder you're still a Son of God then you got to conduct yourself as a Son of God all this time out parents get so tired of their children sometime time out time out just just get away well that's not God he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even to the end of the world Hallelujah where's it going to be in you in you I know this is Elementary it's either Elementary it's going over you but he's in you in you that we live like he's in us we talk like he's in us we pray like he's in us God help us all amen I know this Humanity we we sometimes this Humanity causes us to forget these things on but may we never forget get them things it's Christ in you the hope of glory and that's the mystery that was revealed in this age Bless The Name of Jesus we are part of his godhead Christ in you we are made in His image and in his likeness you realize Angels didn't come from him they were a creation but they didn't come from him but you're more than a creation you are a gene seed of God you're part of God can you say Amen so we are not a separate entity hello that's what Jesus or or God in the creation of man and woman would show us he didn't make something separate from Adam she was Adam flesh of his flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his spirit yes sir ain't that what we are yeah that's what a prophet said she's bone of his bone life of his life Spirit of his spirit Power of his power she is himen brother Braham said see we become part of his word part of his life for we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life see so notice what Jesus said in he was in Revelations 1 18 I am Alpha and Omega yeah the beginning and the ending say the Lord which is which was which is to come the almighty can you say Amen so what is alpha mean the first what is Omega the last ain't that right and the prophet said he never said anything in between he just said I am Alpha and I am Omega the beginning and the end but he never said anything in between can you say Amen yes sir see so the alpha if he is the Alpha and Omega then the AL Omega is the same as the alpha same power same life same nature same character that's right you believe that we saw him as the alpha when he walked the Earth yes we saw what he was in his first ministry as the alpha we saw what he done in his ministry as the alpha amen as Alpha he was the full manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh to dwell Among Us ain't that right see so now if he is the Omega then everything that he was as ala he still is today brother B said he's the same in every way but his Corporal body amen he didn't need his Corporal body to walk on the Earth again why got you he redeemed you glory glory hello he redeemed you that now he can be what he was in Christ now he can be in you isn't that his purpose now we're living in the greatest age of deception Satan's eating perfect it God's not worried about you on he's not worried about what you young people face no no he's not worried about what you parents face or pastors ministers face because he knows who he is he's been able to redeem you to where he himself now can live and have full preeminence are you with me full preeminence Lord and if he's got full preeminence then what devil can bother you what devil can destroy you what devil can defeat you Hallelujah well glory to God so brother Bram said the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the second last message message is the same I was in Alpha I'm in Omega there will be a day that won't be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light see Alpha and Omega it's become the first and the last and he said Alpha has become Omega all in another place said all the powers that God had rested in Christ and the fullness of Christ rests in his church amen you believe that amen so he said see the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church can you say Amen just before the fire falls he said we're not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God that's why it's important to come to church that's why it's important to belong to a church hello why because each one of us is holding a part of God now if you're not holding a part of God then don't worry about it go go roam around do what you want to do but when God calls you to a local assembly you are you are you are to be uh what is that called uh uh loyal to that assembly hello why God doesn't call you just to be be there to be your own little individual and everybody you know pamper you you hold a part of God can you say Amen the church needs you ain't that right so we got to be in unity we get you see each one of us is holding a part of God we must come together then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church can you say Amen is this all right so notice what brother Braham says any believer that's got the Holy Spirit you have the power of God within you yeah how many believes it yes let me ask you how many's got the Holy Spirit living in you right yes sir put your hand up with convictions now and if he's in you then you have the authority to pray the prayer of faith that's what a prophet say said you have the authority to pray the prayer of faith so you're not just coming down and you're not just mumbling words and just well let's just see what if it happen no you come down on your knees realizing I've got Authority here that devil is going to he's going to pay for it he's going to get it because I'm getting down on my knees in prayer while the world's dependent upon the psychologists and doctors and movies and entertainment and all that there is a group of people that is finding the answers on their knees in prayer can you say Amen see prayer limits the devil it just limits the devil amen praise the Lord so you realize that prayer is a must can you say that with me prayer is a must is a say that again prayer is a must pray is a must because because God cannot do anything for you until you ask for it don't go ask the president everybody's just crossing their fingers hoping Trump gets in he's not your God he's not a miracle worker right we definitely know Biden ain't so we get so wrapped up in politics and yet there's so many disappointed people Democrat Republican independent whatever you want to be so disappointed people and the in fears out in the world today because people don't know what to do they're looking for solid answers and they don't have them but you do so see so therefore now notice in Matthew 9:37 Jesus said to his disciples the Harvest truly is plent plous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest the one that was telling them to pray was the lord of the Harvest ain't that right so brother BR said what he was saying is you pray to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest which I'm just telling you is a needy thing but see why couldn't he just do it then if he's the lord of the Harvest why doesn't he do it it he sees the need he said because part of it lays in human beings they had to pray they had to ask that's right now notice how he's directing their prayer they don't know that they the Harvest is you know uh uh plenteous and the laborers are few he puts that in them and tells them how to pray pray unto me the lord of the Harvest pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors okay let's pray right but he's the lord of the Harvest why didn't he do it because brother Brown says this see the kingdom everybody say the kingdom of God lays within human beings so God is not going to P bypass you Hallelujah can you say Amen oh wouldn't that be nice we know we have problems wouldn't it just be nice God just answers every time I mean just gives it to us and we don't have nothing to do just just just just he just sends all the blessings no no no he's not going to bypass you you've got to get on your knees you got to ask ask can you say Amen so he says see you asked me to do what I know needs to be done but you got to ask me see if you want to know the will of God for your life pray amen amen that's right pray oh I just I just wish I could go do something I I know a lot of guys want to go be an evangelist I got them in my church one to just go be an Evangel but no one's calling them so I don't know what to do I don't I just pray pray aren't you serving the same God that we all serve can God open the doors if he wants them open that's right right can God do something for you see I I if you need God to do something for you what do we do pray can you say Amen if you want the blessings of God pray see James 5:14 is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with allil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith everybody say the prayer of faith fath shall save the sick physically spiritually and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed the effectual everybody say the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man Glory availeth much can you say Amen as I get ready to close now brother Braham said when the weakest of saints fall on their knees the Devils tremble you don't have to live your life in confusion you don't have to keep beating your head against the wall to try to make things happen the best thing for us to do is pray that's right okay you young people you want to know what God you know your your pattern for Your Life future for your life learn to pray learn to pray can you say Amen brother Bram said what a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God now this word effectual fervent means desperation the desperate prayer of a righteous man in other words what he does is he stays with it until it's answered right yes I think sometimes as I get ready to close but sometimes we're so used to everything just right then right now right now right now right now so we pray for five minutes and something very crucial in our lives that we need God to really do we just pray for that five minutes we we said our prayer but sometimes it has to be a desperate prayer sometimes it it a fervent you know the Bible talks about Elijah being a man of life like passion as we are he had his UPS he had his Downs he had his times of differences and disappointments but he was a righteous man who prayed and brother brandom say see no man is righteous only the Son of God so we don't stand and I don't stand in my righteousness I stand in his righteousness so as long as I'm Anointed with him it's the effectual fervent prayer of the right Christ interceding for you through me to have you to believe ain't that right so a lot of times our prayer is a prayer of inter interceding intercession intercession we're making intercession for prayer for others and if you notice Elijah he was the prophet for the age of Israel the children of Israel was in trouble and having a burden for them and having you know he he he stood in between a lot of things from the evil and the good and all that but he began to pray the Bible says he prayed earnestly that it might not rain can you say Amen here he was a prophet the word of the Lord come to that prophet and yet all the prophets had to pray they had to get on their knees they they they had to seek God for answers it didn't come to them easily and you say Amen see because prayer is a law of God James 4:2 says you ask not you have not because you ask not in other words you pray not brother Bram said see you don't ask you don't pray because you don't believe ain't that right and so the Bible says that it rained not on Earth for the space of three years in six months then James 5:18 says and he Elijah prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit but in case you don't know Elijah just didn't pray one time he just didn't get down and say Lord you know I love you we're needing rain today amen no he was a man that knew how to pray fervently can you say Amen so First Kings 18:41 and Elijah said to Ahab get thee up and drink eat and drink for there's a sound of abundance of rain so Elijah must have had a vision of it raining or he wouldn't have said that to Ahab so Elijah or so Ahab the 42nd verse Ahab went up to eat and drink notice Ahab goes and eat and drink and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and cast himself down down on the earth and put his face between his knees why because Elijah is praying for rain wow so he tells he tells Ahab I hear it it's coming that he's going up to the mountain and he's praying to God God Send the Rain God send the rain this this this wasn't just some little thing for him can you say amen and he said to his servant go what now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there's nothing and Elijah said go again how many times did he do that seven times a prophet of God already told the king it's going to rain and he prays the first time nothing happens does he stop no gets back on his knees and he begins to pray doesn't say how long he prayed he just prayed nothing happens he gets back on his knees seven times but he's desperate I got to get the answer can you sayen I got to get an answer amen I got to get an answer he knew that God was living he knew that God would answer oh Jesus may it become in us to really know that God answers prayer right this isn't just a little thing that we do this isn't just a little obligation okay I've said my prayers for today now let's move no God answers prayers ain't that right and if he ain't answered your prayer don't stop praying you don't have to be tore up you don't have to be all out of sort none of us have to if we can just result in prayer just turn to God in prayer and begin to pray knowing that he will answer our prayer you love him if the musicians will come I thought of the time that the shite woman her son had died and she goes to Elijah she wouldn't leave and until Elisha comes down to the house to pray for the child and yeah the Bible says that he went in Elisha the prophet went in therefore and shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord now that's all we hear as he prayed unto the Lord maybe just a simple little prayer that we would think but the prophet tells us that when Elisha walked in and shut that door and he's there alone he prayed and he prayed and he prayed Elisha got desperate yeah CU he knew that child was a promise he knew that woman was believing yes you understand what I'm saying see people and I hope this is all right but people do you realize that a lot of people are depending on us why your lost loved ones are depending on you why because you have contact with God Satan's ravaged them Satan's got them in the mind and torment and everything else there's so many of our loved ones that maybe are just believing that they're lost forever that there is no way to get back and they've send their day of Grace away but there's someone that knows the mercy of God and says no he's alive today and he's given me a promise isn't that what the promise was given to the mothers no matter how waver your children is no matter no matter no matter how wavered if you have enough faith for yourself believe for your loved one believe for them and no matter how wward they are even if God has to put them on the deathbed they'll be saved that's a promise it's a promise can you say Amen oh do you love him isn't he wonderful so Jesus taught us to be persistent with our prayer Luke 1817 and I promise you I'll let you go but Jesus said he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was a city in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of M adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this wi TR troubl me I will avenge her lest by her continuing coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which CED day and night unto him though he bear long with them he said well go God ain't answering my prayer right away but what are you going to do about it just stop give up NOP prayer of faith prayer of faith knows that God's going to answer some someday prayer of faith knows that God's going to answer can you say Amen Matthew 7:7 ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find and it shall be open unto you for everyone that askthe findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open or what man is there of you whom if he ask his if his son asked bread will he give him a stone if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him can you say Amen oh my I love the Lord amen what song you playing More I Seek You The More I Seek You the more I find you the more I find [Music] you the more I love [Music] you The More I Seek You the more I find Hallelujah the more I find [Music] you the more now notice what the prophet said he saids the first thing you have to do if you're going to find Christ you've got to know that you've got a need of him and when you think that you just don't need him then you'll never find him because you won't search him diligently he said' did you notice that scripture where it says seek and you shall find knock and it'll be open actually that's not just knock he says and it'll be open he that's not just say well I went out Lord here I am you want me no that's not it he that seeketh he that knth continuation see continuation it has to compare with the rest of the scriptures like the unjust judge and the widow she constantly knocked on his door she was persistent if he turned her away today tomorrow she was on his hands again now that's the way you want to get God be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking just don't knock a little while see and get tired and go away just keep standing there and say Lord I'm here and I'm I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now I'm going to stay right here you getting tired of listening well I'm having a great time knocking cuz I know you're coming that's when something happens he has to get you off his hands so he comes out to answer you that's right can you say amen he said oh I like that determined to hold on he said if you start out for God hold on until the Holy Ghost comes com until everything that you've asked for takes place just don't give up I'll not leave you I'm on your hands Lord until you answer me that's the way to do it can you say amen he said now if you notice it isn't just say Lord I want it he that askthe keep on seeking keep on knocking just keep on you've arrived there see so just keep on knock until it happens I believe it Lord I'm on your hands I'm on your hands don't be AF afraid to ask God for anything don't be afraid to ask God anything another thing the prophet says is ask big ask big can you say Amen can you lift your hands unto the Lord do you love him isn't he wonderful oh bless the
