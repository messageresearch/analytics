we're going to have a generation if the Lord should carry and I should pass away I believe we've got young people in this church church right here that'll carry this message on to the coming of the Lord amen it's perpetual God's going to have a bride and I believe I'm part of that bride here this morning and I'm glad it's to me to to me and my children and my children's children and I'm so glad uh that we are raising our children you're raising your children in the ways of the Lord you've made the choice Amen to teach them what Christmas is truly about what Christ is truly about I I thank God I thank God for all of you you parents and for you young people to catch in this glorious revelation of Jesus Christ amen well we say good morning to all of you and and we wish you all a a wonderful Christmas and uh in this Christmas season let's look here in in Luke the 2 chapter amen and um we're going to start at the first verse praise the Lord I um I sort of uh this is this is going to be given the account of of of the Shepherds and things and we spoke a little bit on that Wednesday night uh and I'm not going to be speaking on the Shepherds here this morning but I just wanted to uh use this as the opening uh Christmas message and um we got a wonderful day planned ahead um the the young people have got a a wonderful little play and and then um uh uh we're going to have our um uh our our regular Christmas service with Christmas carols and and uh we'll we'll end it with brother Merl and and U uh reading and to us to all of us kids and um and so um it it's something how Traditions get started um and I think Traditions are good as long as they're good ones and um amen I I'd rather those kind of those kind of traditions to to happen and and um then then to have bad traditions amen I'd rather have these kind of traditions even than sitting around a Christmas tree amen and so uh we're we're so thankful uh for that let's look here in in uh uh Luke 2 and 1 and it come to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when serenus was governor of Syria and it went and all went to be taxed and everyone into to his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth unto Judea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn and wrapped him in the swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring Good Tidings of bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were going away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the baby laying in the manger and when they had seen it they uh they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen as it was told unto them let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today today Lord for your love and the gift of Salvation thankful Lord that you seen something Lord that many of times we have not seen within ourselves but Lord you so loved us that you come to Earth to be one of us oh God we're so thankful Lord that you have not left us in this in in this uh Tabernacle Lord left us in this prison House of flesh but you have redeemed us Lord and I'm thankful for it father Lord as we speak this morning Lord about that wonderful day and what it means to us and in my simple way here this morning Lord I want you to receive glory and I want to say it the way Lord that I could put a lot of glory and praise upon you this morning morning for you truly are worthy of so much more than we could ever give you but Lord with all of our heart we want to we want you to be pleased with our thoughts every thought in this building with our motives every motive we want you to be pleased with our heart Lord I ask that you would anoint us Let Your Presence be with us Lord we give you glory and honor and we love you with all of our heart in jesus' name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning amen praise the lord we truly love the Lord Jesus want to speak here this morning on this Christmas and maybe put a title what is man and I it's it's a different thought maybe I I don't know you know you but I I want to think about amen the the Monumental thing that that took place 2,000 years ago today Christmas has become a celebration and it's become uh a tradition of uh lights and and Santas and Christmas trees and and um there gift swapping and and a lot of these things that man has nothing to do with the birth of Jesus Christ has nothing at all to do with salvation in fact these Christmas trees and lights and gift swapping was taking place hundreds and hundreds of of years before the Christ was ever born amen and it was a pagan the Pagan church that instituted this into Christmas amen it was Pagan worship it's the Pagan it's it's the Pagan uh Catholic Church that brought this in amen the first 300 years after Christ was born after he was crucified and resurrected there was not one celebration of Christmas so I want to make that clear this morning celebration started with the Catholic church now amen is there is there reason to celebrate amen uh yes we celebrate Independence Day we celebrate our nation's birthday we celebrate your birthdays we we celebrate Lincoln's birthday as a nation we celebrate Lee's birthday and and Washington's birthday amen but this is a little different situation this is when God came to Earth to redeem us this is not a cele celebration this is when God took on a body created a body this is when God himself became a man this is worship this is why we worship this is why we come to church this is why were able to pray before you could not even pray amen and have your no sin prayers are he are heard from God outside of the blood of Jesus Christ amen but it was because of the great thoughts of God that we come to church you see we don't come to church and celebrate I'm not one that cares for the song celebrate Jesus celebrate I am not one for those kinds of uh amen uh uh worship songs that that that one wants to Simply uh uh just give us give us something to to to um uh you know bring into the human realm because listen anything that is that is concerning God and concerning salvation it should be of worship it should be of the deepest of sincerity this is the time that God came to Pardon man from their sins and to loose us from the powers of hell can you say Amen aren't you glad that we're not celebrating Christmas we are worshiping the king we are worshiping King lamb here this morning now the Heathen they bring the reving spirit to the church and everything is a party until the church becomes a party until amen uh the church services become a party and everything is a party until Hollywood has replaced the sacred worship I hope I'm doing okay amen I've only been preaching five minutes and some's already getting a little scared of what I'm going to be saying this morning but amen but I I I want to say here this morning I would rather worship than I would to amen uh uh uh uh uh to to to to take on with the Santa Clauses and the and the and the gift swapping and the and and and and the stage shows and the programs and all of this just give me the lovely Lord Jesus give me the love that passes all understanding give me the relationship between me and God Amen that I can love my brother amen and they can love me give me what Christmas is genuinely about let me find that baby in my heart can you say amen amen you see there's a sacredness and a worship that should go with Christmas I believe Christmas should have come with a fresh amen consecration to the Lord of thanking God for the gift of eternal life amen because that's truly what Christmas is all about Amen brother Brandon would say now in in a few weeks amen or even right now there's reindeers and Santa Clauses and jingle bells and all kinds of things hanging up which is Pagan ceremony it's an article of the Catholic church people paying great prices and swapping presents all things like that is Pagan Christmas is a day of worship amen and by the way Christ wasn't born on the 25th of December either he couldn't have been if you've ever been in Judea the hills are full of snow worse than it is here amen born in April when all nature comes forth but it's their tradition and why do we do those things because we follow the traditions of men instead of The Commandments of God something like that wouldn't matter but they just make a uh a a commercial day out of it it's a disgrace it's a shame for them to do such things as that a pagan ceremony when Santa when when did Santa Claus have anything to do with Jesus when did the Easter rabbit or chicken excuse me uh uh colored up with some kind of ink or something or some kind of little white rabbit have anything to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ don't you see how the commercial world that's the reason they sell these old rock and roll books and dirty pictures and vulgar and things like that that is because the nature of the people crave for such nonsense that's right it's because there's something wrong in the heart they've never entered into the rest with God and ceased from these things when they come into that and receive the Holy Ghost then they're finished with the world and the things of the world can you say amen amen so I say today amen you know uh uh uh let's look at the real Christmas why don't we why why why don't we look here real real sincerely in our heart and say Amen Lord I I what I want more than anything else is my child to have eternal life amen what I want more than anything else is for my babies to know the real reason amen not all this Christmas tree nonsense and all of Amen all of this h h h stuff where we where where we just fit right in line with all amen of the of the norm of of leot Amen Let me take this time to reflect what Christmas is really about amen when God so loved the world that he come and took on a body so that he could pay the price for my sin let me tell them that there's some all is so worth something to God that he came took on a body to understand them and love them and die for them and bring them back to Heaven Hallelujah that's man your Christmas toys are going to break maybe within the first month you kids now I I see nothing wrong if your daddy mama wants to get you a little gift man I I I I have no problem with that but your little gifts are going to pass away mamas and daddies now you know that you got that you're so proud of starts looking like my truck and and before you know it your new house is needing new shingles and before you know it you're needing can you say man so we're not teaching our kids Christmas is is is a gift that perishes we we're teaching our we're teaching our children that their soul is so worth something that God did not come down to give them a new haird God did not come down Amen in in order for them uh you know to to fit in with Le oys it it's not the it's not the makeup it's not the new clothes it's not it's it's not the way amen God so loves that soul that he came down to redeem [Applause] them can you say amen amen sir we would see Jesus he says now let me make this clear I do not believe that Jesus would care what day you worshiped his birthday on if it's the 25th 26th whether it's in April May June July or whatever it is just so you worship you worship them on any day but here's what it is they've taken the sacredness from Christmas to make it not a Christmas amen a day of worship but a celebration and you hear people say we're going to celebrate Christmas that's wrong we would never celebrate Christmas or should never celebrate Christmas Christmas is a day of worship amen not a celebration Christmas was the day when God become man we just sung the song The Great Creator on became my savior what is it what is it about man what is it about man that God had these thoughts in his mind that he just couldn't get away from he wanted to become a man there in John 1 and and 14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth hallelujah could you imagine those disciples as John is is describing there in I I I believe it's in first John John 1 and one and and and and and if you want to put that up there sister khila here here John one of the disciples is trying to describe what it was like when they walk with Jesus and he and and he says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes and we've looked upon and our hands have handled of the very Word of Life for the life was manifested and we seen it and we bear witness and we show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us there there the great Eternal Creator he he come and he lived in a body and we handled this great Eternal Word we had in the beginning was the the word the word was with God the Word was God we handled that word he was made flesh he dwelt with us he ate with us he slept with us he drank with us he cried with us Peter could say when my when my mother-in-law was sick and Jesus he he was more than just a teacher but he come to my mother-in-law who was dying and God healed him they could turn around and say Amen we were on that boat we were on that boat that was going down and Peter had tried so hard to keep the boat up and going he tried so hard and when he worked and worked and worked and worked and couldn't and finally when all hope was gone we went down to the battle of the ship and we said Jesus do do you care that L we perish and we walk watched him stand up and wipe the sleeve from his eyes and put his put his foot on the brow on the bow of the boat and say peace be still Hallelujah and they said we we all huddled together and said what kind of a man yeah is this for even the storms and the winds and the waves oby this m n he he the they all nature obeys this [Music] man Hallelujah the disciples there wondering what what what Jesus was doing when he was saying when he was telling his disciples you know when the when the runner had come and said your friend Lazarus is dying and his sisters are calling for you and Jesus just keeps going the opposite direction and his friends and and the disciples says aren't you his friend you you're he's been there with you and and and and and Jesus just keeps on going and finally he dies and and and they just misunderstanding and finally he says to them man you know he's dead and and they were there when he went back and they were there when they heard uh uh a Mary you know or Martha saying where I I wish you would have been here and they were there when Jesus said come here amen roll back the stone they were there when when they said oh Master he stinketh he stinketh they were there when Jesus stood there took that little old they mean thin framed body stood up that he said Lazarus come forth and a dead man that had been dead for 4 days came out of that grave they seen God they saw the great Eternal one in a moral body here on this Earth Hallelujah here they come and saw this Dead Man Walking and uh man it's still wrapped up in his grave clothes come on we've handled the Word of Life yes we've handled Colossians 1:9 it says for it pleased the father that in this man should dwell the fullness are y'all understanding me amen preach what is what is what is do you do do do you see that GI swapping has nothing to do with this great Eternal God do you do you see you kids understand these things that's the reason why we don't have Christmas trees that's the reason why we don't we we we don't dress up as Santa Claus accessory we want something we want to tell you what we saw what we believe what we preach is real it's true Jesus Christ lives today hallelujah hallelujah can you say amen amen reason why we don't preach that nonsense because it's a lie it's not the truth but Jesus is the truth Jesus is the way Jesus is the savior and I'm so thankful for that man Christ Jesus Hallelujah that's it yes sir for it pleased the father that in him should the fullness dwell can you say man amen why man man's a mystery why me why you why would God leave everything Eternal about why would god what caused God to leave everything Divine yeah to come he didn't take on angels He didn't become an angel he become a man amen David even back before Christ came he he was mulling over in his mind and Psalms 8 And1 he says oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name and all the Earth who has set thy Glory above the heavens out of the babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest steal the enemy and the advenger when I consider the heavens and the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and yet you've crowned him with Glory and Honor thou mest him to have dominion over the works of thine hands and thou H has put all things under his feet and all the sheep and oxen and yay the Beast of the field and the foul of the air and the fish of the sea whatsoever passeth through the uh uh the the paths of the sea oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all of the Earth God God was David sitting there musing he's he's musing and and I want to tell you Hallelujah he's not the only one musing the Bible says the angels have been musing the angels have sat around wondering what's going on what what is going on are you are you understanding me amen you you see there was something about the man that was an investment you see see God had created the Earth and he said it is good and he created the the stars and he says it is good he he he created amen all of the the plant life and he goes all the way through but when he created M he says and it is very good there there's something about man there's something that about a human being being that that causes a twinkle in God's eye there's something about the human being that God a mind when he looks it it makes his heart Peter patter there's so Hallelujah sometimes you think I'm I'm I have to convince God to hear my prayer no God wants to hear you pray God Longs for communion God Longs for Fellowship God loves you amen hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord now he had said all of the seeds I want you to produce after your kind apple seed after your kind apricot seed after your kind I boot seed after its kind giraff seed after it kind yeah praise the Lord but when God made man now he had said let there be the the animal life and he created them from the desk of the earth and he and he and but but when he made man the Bible says he made man in his own image you want to know why God loves man is because man man is made in his own image seed after seed apple seeds apples come from apple seeds amen bananas come from banana seeds hallelujah amen uh uh baboons come from baboon seeds sons of God comes from God's seeds oh can you say Amen Hallelujah and when God looks at this God gave dominion and authority to the man he had already invested himself amen he in order for man to fail God would fail because man came from God He Man was not just a a a spoken word creation like all of the rest he was the very word seed of God he was the he he came from God he he came from the very loins of Elohim amen can you say man it's no wonder that man is a little different than all the rest of the creation amen even after the fall he he still loved man he had already invested everything he had into man he had already told him I'm giving you the authority I'm giving you the Dominion I'm giving you what it takes and the reason that God does nothing that's the reason that God does nothing outside of a man he always works through a man because he has to use a man he had to use a man a man is what he had to use to display his attribute of Savior he had to make him in his image make him something like him and put him on free moral agency and let him act in way that he wanted to he could take his choice he knew that man by giving him that choice would fall and so being that he had to do that he turns back around and makes the man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through a man are are are y'all just catching that that that quote are you catching that quote God could have told him you've blown it man you know what you're an idiot you blown in but what God seen at the beginning yeah what God loved about man at the beginning is what he loved about man today you go what he saw there you go I think that's beautiful that's love in the first degree right there that's where God can come and tell you that that that's where we get to express that husband to wife and wife to husband and and M's and daddies to Children is listen I there's something that goes Way Beyond your fault and Way Beyond your your mistakes and Way Beyond your frailties Way Beyond I see something in you that goes Way Beyond any kind of flaws in you I see the depths of God in you amen if we could have that kind of depth for our children that kind of dep for our spouses if we could have that kind of love then the world would be a different place the church would be a different place God seen something in man and he was willing to go the extra mile praise the Lord Brother brandom says I can hear Adam says to Eve sweetheart let's go up to church it's time to worship father now they didn't have plush seats they didn't they had no denominations they went right up into the great Cathedral and there when the great light come down they worshiped God now now I want you to understand am I going too slow I want you to understand this is what God loved he looked forward to that time of the day when his children bone of his bone flesh of his flesh the ones that came from him would come up in that great Cathedral under the trees and the great Pillar of Fire would come down and hover among them and then they would go for a walk an evening stroll them and God all right now there was no condemnation there was no sin right there was no wishing I would have done something different there was no wishing I would have not used that word or I wish I wouldn't have lost my temper or I wish I wouldn't have said this or acted this way there was no regret there was no regret right Adam and Eve were made in the image of of God they could commune with God fellowship with God there was there was there was no inhibitions what God was they were in body form Adam could speak to the tree to come over and give shade to his sweetheart they had total control and authority over all things and they would walk with God have you ever thought what it would be to go to prayer without one bit of regret have you ever thought about going to God and walking with god without with zero brother I'm talking about the innocence of a child I'm talking about the Inn these these babies these babies they they know nothing like us human like us adults would know they're innocent well their little their little hearts amen the little things that they go through and the and and and and the and the and the mountains that that they're staring at are just little bitty Mills compared to me and you now we've come through life and we've got a lot of regrets and we've got a lot of Sorrows we carry those babies are born innocent can you say Amen so was God's children they were they they come Innocent they were totally innocent Oh Glory to God but now with the fall now with the fall they're no longer worshiping now they're full of regret now now it's hard it's hard for them to come and worship in fact they can't come and worship the garden is closed angels are there with the everflame every this the the flaming swords that go every which direction no one can come to the tree of life now here Adam and Eve Cain and Abel are asking why are you always standing at this gate they're always asking they mama why do you cry so much as you stand here looking in that in that Garden that don't look much different than what we have here what's in that Garden come on Daddy why why wh why why why why can't we we're are are you understanding but you see now there's condemnation condemnation brings tears tears comes from regrets and hurts and pains and Sorrows now everything is broken everything is empty life is empty Adam's life is empty Eve's life is empty they're no longer Walking with God but God would go through all of the God would go through all the Testament he would he would bring up little little times oh I want a fellowship I want one thing one one scripture that just comes to mind that that that is that that where where where Jehovah is is really expressing and that's in in Isaiah 1 and 18 where where where God says come let us reason together for though your sin be a Scarlet put that up there sister Keys though your sins be a Scarlet somewhere around there in that first chapter amen they will be as white as snow and though they be red like Crimson I'm going to take all of your regrets I'm going to take all of your bad decisions I'm going to take your Sorrows I'm going to take them all away and I'll make them like wool won't you come let's reason together come back like we used to won't you come back would you come back I want to walk with you again come on Budd yeah we can't meet we can't meet in that Cathedral anymore that's that's off limits but if you just shed a blood just shed some blood I'll come down and visit you just take an innocent lamb just lay the lamb I'll come down I'll visit with you come on I I want to fellowship with you I miss you I love you I want my I want my children back I I I know your sins are so great I know but I I promise you I'll move them as far as the East is from the West I'll move them as far as the heavens are up from the Earth if you will just come and consider me I want to bring you back to myself oh God it was the love of Papa yeah it was the love oh yes he would get so angry at him oh yes but his heart was bleeding for them am but it's just like man it's just like man to turn the good into evil it's just like man to search for his own way because his heart is evil he's unregenerated I'm trying to tell to you children about Christmas evil man take the goodness of God and trample it under the foot they made Idols they worshiped cows they made Idols of brass Stone and Wood Silver and even when Jesus came in the body in the in the person of Jesus Christ he even looked over Jerusalem and he says oh if you would have only known your day I'm the god that created you I'm the god that talked to Abraham remember when Isaiah said come let us reason I've created a path I'm here I want to fellowship with you he's weeping I'm the pillar of fire I'm the one that led you out of Egypt and brought you to this land he's weeping he's agonizing over over Jerusalem he's looking and he's saiding oh oh if you would have known the day of your visitation the hour your hour is here and you don't know it can you say man but you see it had to be that way because Jesus was born to die I look and I think of what Redemption means and and even there in First Peter 1 and8 it says in whom having not seen you love in whom though ye see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and search diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what matter of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it test testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto they unto us they did Minister these things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost uh uh Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels deern start to look into you see the Salvation they knew it was coming now they all knew it was coming they've been prophesying and they was thinking what who who would this come to when will this happen and what were they looking for they were looking for that man they were looking for the time that God would become a human they were looking for scriptures like first 1 Timothy 2 and5 there is one God and there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ramom for all they were they were looking for that one for that one according to 2 Corinthians 5:19 to what God was in in the man reconciling the world unto themselves they were looking for that time now stay with me a little longer I'm not going to hold you too long the angels are by bystanders they're looking the prophets have been looking the angels are wondering what what kind of people would this be this one that is made lower than the Angels the angels are ministering Spirits they stand around the throne and worship day and night saying holy holy holy they do God's bidding they carry messages of judgment and of Victory and though God loves those angels and though those angels never sinned those angels stood those angels stood when man didn't oh yeah they had a choice Lucifer already drag out a third of the Angels they stood and though God loved those angels the heart throb of God was man there you go amen though God loved his angels there you go oh God as I'm thinking here today I I'm telling you it's it's quite an incredible thing Hebrews 1 and5 would say For unto which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and then again I will be to him a father and he will be myself son and then again he's he's quoting back when he bringeth the first begotten into the world he saith let all the angels of God worship Him this man this man was such was such the love of God was such an expression of God that God would even tell the Angels worship him God would so love this Christ child that now the world would worship God when they worshiped Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen Hebrews 1:3 but to which of the Angels he's asking the question again but to which of the Angels said he had any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stool he says are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be hes now he's talking to you and me so now he's he's talking about the angels that he was made lower than the angels and yet God exalted him and given him a name above all names and said if you want to worship me worship the lamb but then he turns around and says are they not all ministering Spirit sent forth to for them who shall be HS of Salvation when God exalts him God exalted you do you understand why God had to come in a body God done this God was so pleased to come among us because he wanted you you see only a human being could restore back the human prise yes sir only a human only a human being could restore genuine worship we were all under the curse and the penalty of sin oh but God said I'm going to give you a sign yes this is going to be a sign of my love even the angels have desired to look on this the prophets have desired to see this this will be the sign of signs it will be the most incredible of all no Genius of man will ever be able to compare to it no Genius of man will ever be able to take from it amen even in today when the genius of Satan and the genius of the Heathen church has tried to replace this man with all of its Pagan worship yeah that it pull out of the ancient Pagan books hundreds of years of the past it'll never compare to it the labs of science will never be able to produce the cold the inventors of all times will never be able to create a product like the Virgin birth the Virgin birth gave us the product the Virgin birth brother John went God took and placed his seed into the womb of of of of uh uh not not Eve Amen in the womb of Mary and right then hallelujah that was a promise yeah that was a promise that was a promise that's how that's reason I can stand up here and preach for 30 something years saying that Jesus is coming and Jesus word is true is because God proved it in a little baby boy God done it God done it to save you Luke God done it to save you Aaron and simy and kyin God came on Earth to pay the price to save all of God's Sons he will be a sign can you say amen amen it'll be a sign of Deliverance it'll be a sign of peace this baby will be a sign of Victory because when this virgin conceives God will once again dwell in a body he will live among man what does this do as I am descending what does this do come on it doesn't create celebration it creates worship yes have you ever thought about Ephesians 4 and 6 it just sort of sums it up Sister Keys If You' put that up there one God and Father of all who was above all and through all and in you all is the father he was above us you you can see him all through the nature you can see him through the plant life you can see him through the sun rising and setting you can see God you can see God in so many areas but he's not just the father above all and through all he's now in the church His blessings are upon the church I think the sincerity Even in our little church here they see the children smirk and while a man of God's trying to preach come with attitudes or I don't know what what's what's going on but they in serious service and they're smirking and looking at each other and doing these kinds of things where's the respect where's the respect what does Christmas mean what does salvation mean what is this a game is not this real is not this real is this not do we not want to line our hearts up with what God is do we do we not want a Christmas in our hearts do we not want the presence of God the Eternal one who became a man to die and PID the penalty for us so that we can experience life with him where's he at where's he at he says I've going to prepare a place for you mortal beings I'm going to live there Immortal man with youl random says Heaven's not going to be the fitment of your imagination he says we're going to live there we're going to walk there we're going to be there amen thank you right yes sir we're preparing to leave this place oh yes we've got all of these rich men you can who can take their Rockets up to the up and orbit this you know the Earth and and and and and and and you know they've got this secret society trying to build just in case the Earth ever blows up you know yeah or they can live over there and they're storing up and stocking up here God come through the womb of a virgin through the immaculate uh uh the immaculate Earth and and the power of the Holy Spirit through the conception within Mary to give you and I eternal life and his promise I'm going to take you back I've heard some kids say oh I don't want the Lord to come until I get married I want to we're we're all there there ain't nothing what you smiling about amen there ain't Ain nothing there ain't nothing any more precious listen all of you little kids are going to be 18 20 21 years old when you get there it's going to be the it's going to be the time of Life all of you old ones you're going to be 18 20 21 22 it's going to be the time of life let let me tell you it's going to be more real than this you're going to be going back right here you've got this condemnation right here I don't care who you are I don't care whether it where you if if you've been on Earth any time at all you've got regrets you've got things you've got mind battles you've got complexes you've got these things that make you feel like you you're not worthy you're not good no one loves you you you you've got things that just pointing out all of your mistakes your weaknesses this is this is what you're living in you're going to be living in a body in heaven that there will not be any condemnation because there will be no sin you will not have any thoughts of sin you'll not have any thoughts of regrets you'll never have any pain in your body you'll never have any of that and it would have never been possible if God did not come in a body than Lord I'm going to heaven yes sir because of Christmas yes sir 1 Timothy 2 and6 says he gave himself a ransom for us all can you say Amen a ransom in other words he come and paid the money yes he paid the blood Money Titus 2:4 says who gave him himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zelus of good works now watch this now I know I know that someday we're going to go and and and and and these body all that land will have no sin sin will be totally demolished Satan will be done amen all of the evil be will be the Earth the the the Bible says amen that that he is going to purge this Earth with a holy fire of God and just for you all to understand the three stages of Redemption how many how many of you kids knows what it takes to be born again amen anyone want to any of you kids just real quickly any any of them there's three of them there's three stages to being born again and there ain't no wrong statements I'll just tell you dummy if you guess it wrong no what what is okay daddies mamas y'all help me the the three huh you're Justified with the blood you wash your sins away with with the water and then you are baptized with the Holy Spirit yes Jesus has shed his blood the water has been washed in the days of Noah yes and then the Earth is going to be renovated or it's going to be burnt up by fire justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost it's going to be a brand new Earth and we're going to live I love him praise the Lord Brother Brandon says and then God come down and lived in man suffered with man to redeem man now watch this this is for us today this is right now this is before we we even get on the other side the holy spirit's doing it within us right now that's the reason our soul can be changed that's why God comes and lives within us justification it's the blood the water and the spirit amen when a birth comes it's got to have blood water spirit when Christ comes in us that has to be justified Sanctified and then baptized he goes now he comes down and lives suffered with man to redeem man and the Holy Spirit comes into man and drives that that Blackness and sin away from him and brings it back into perfect Fellowship a part of God and now we by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from sins become Sons and Daughters of God who is God the one that stood there and rode the Stars off his hands and rode the worlds out of his hands and made the things which do not appear deity deity himself lives in man the Creator that made heavens and earth is now living in inen brother brandom says you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God God Longs for his creature who he created in His image to fellowship with him wouldn't you love to have lived in that time of the Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to come down in the cool of the evening talk with them and fellowship with them would that be marvelous we all would like to have that in time now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you that we can come right back on them terms again with God tonight right straight back to that kind of Fellowship now as I close he's restored Fellowship you you can walk with God in the cool of the evening Adam communicated with God before he had a body and then God put that body in the spirit or or put that spirit in the body and then the body went wherever the spirit went it was the spirit man that was fellowshipping with Spirit God so brother Brandon would say if he would put it last a week understand it he would say so God's the great Pillar of Fire And The Souls of man is like a the little Cloud he said so the little cloud and the pillar of fire would come together and fellowship and the body just tagged along because the body is what the spirit lives in that's the soul that God's redeemed so we can fellowship with God since the price has been paid we can kneel down in prayer we can sit and pray it don't matter whether you have your eyes open when you're praying or whether you have your hands crossed when praying whether you're laying in your bed praying or what what it is is not saying words it's Fellowship you can be on your knees for a whole hour and not Fellowship you can have your hands crossed and kneel down and not Fellowship okay but God has provided a way to bring this body scooted out of the way and all of the sins held against us all of the sins held against us all of the sins held against us so that we can fellowship with Papa once again you go I love it I love it yeah I used to love when my boys would come and jump in my lap I loved it I can still remember different times the older I get the less memory I have of yesterday but I can still remember when they'd come and jump in my lap or when they got older they'd come and asked me to Dad let's go fishing Dad can we oh I just loved it I loved it I love it today when my grandkids come and jump in my lap I love it today when when when when these when all you kids come around I I I I I I listen I you know Luke I I I I enjoy every text I get from you every phone call amen I I appreciate those things I just I love that my enjoyment and my love is nothing compared to what God has when we come and talk to him there's nothing that touches the heart of God on as the people that he's loved with that his heart is that you're the heartthrob of God that when you come to him he tells the Angels say you're just going to have to stop your singing for a few minutes I got to talk to my son yes he does I got to talk to my daughter and the good thing is God don't have grandchildren God has Sons God has daughters right he doesn't have stepchildren he has Sons Sons and Daughters can you say amen he loves you well what is man what makes the angels look and say man what's going on yeah what makes the prophets as they write these things down and they scratch their heads and say what's going to happen what what what what what what what is what's God got in his mind that and they're looking and they're saying when is this all going to happen what what's going to take place if the musicians would come I's see what man is man is the very expression of God a Son of God at the New Birth has the faith of God he has the authority of God and he has the peace of God so that first Christmas morning it was the grace of God living in a [Music] body and this [Music] morning it's the grace of God I think this is my rendition of Christmas for this Christmas sermon when I look at you I see the reason for that birth do whatever you want to for Christmas [Music] I [Music] but God done what he wanted to do for Christmas you didn't have to pull it out of God and God didn't say okay if you love me I'll love you God just gave a gift free [Music] gift it had been in his heart for a very long time [Music] I love him [Music] today do you love him with all your heart God's fullness dwell in him down from his glory [Music] ever living [Music] story my God and savior came and Jesus was born in [Music] Lord in amazer to his [Music] own a stranger a Man of Sorrows tears and Ang hallelujah hallelujah oh oh how I love you how I adore you my breath my sunshine my all in all all the great Creator [Music] be and [Music] full well hallelujah what God bringing [Music]

heavens this morning how hallelujah hallelujah I pra my my [Music] my the great [Applause] [Music] Creator my [Music] saor know God's name [Music] I think as brother Brenham would say tonight we want to find and prove in the scripture where the correct place where God meets and worships with the [Music] people and of course he told us that was in Jesus Christ he was the go between he was the body another place it says I do believe in purgatory but I believe it's right now your soul you purge your own soul Purgatory means to purge when you see that you've done wrong get out there and clean it out of You by confession and crying and fasting and praying someone's even laughed at me when the Lord came here not long ago and gave me a vision I always wanted to see about The Binding that serpent I wondered how to I should step out like that and that's what I've wanted all my life then I began to fast and pray they said what do you do that for I said in there he said I was not sincere enough and after he' come that I wanted to purge myself not wait till you die not let and let some priest try to purge you purge your [Music] souls so no other no greater time than Christmas to make that real true dedication to the Lord and say God has provided a place Santa Claus [Music] H [Music] nonsense but he's provided a place to where we can Purge our souls and say Lord here I am take all the junk out of me take all the junk out of me they don't care whether you're just a little child or whether maybe the oldest in here today would be brother Torrance we still have that meeting place in Jesus Christ if you're not walking with God the way you should and you've just allowed come on folks don't don't don't be Arrogant with God don't don't be playing the games if you're wrong you got a bad attitude get it right if you're sinning get it right if you if you're wrong go to Mama and say I'm sorry if you're God become immortal so that we could do this God became human now all we have to have is a now Serpent's children never can repent they won't repent they just ain't they ain't in them God didn't come for the Serpent's children God came for his children and the prophet said you might have more mistakes than the Serpent's children he said Jacob was lot worse off than Esau that's right but Jacob had it [Music] here so don't look at yourself even and say well but I just repent I don't care if this is your 120th million times you'll never run out of blood repent amen amen that's why he came [Music] that's Christmas that's Christmas so I'm sorry guys I just want a ball amen

probably not going to stay for that Sunday night just going to come back and and that way we can because we're having our annual uh breakfast on on that Monday morning this is when us guys get to show you ladies that we do learn amen and so and uh we learned a couple years ago that we're not allowing the women to buy the biscuits they sabotaged us that's right and uh so uh so so we're going to have that this next we're going to have service uh uh Saturday night Sunday morning and those that want to stay for that Sunday night I mean you'd be welcome to but boy it'd be a lot of driving back if you're going to make it for the for the deals and there I know some of our elders just cannot travel that far and um so we want to keep this this going uh for that Monday morning for sure and um it would be nice if everyone could make it back for that amen all right father we want to thank you for your blessings thank you for what this Christmas season means to us I hope Lord my mumble jumble
