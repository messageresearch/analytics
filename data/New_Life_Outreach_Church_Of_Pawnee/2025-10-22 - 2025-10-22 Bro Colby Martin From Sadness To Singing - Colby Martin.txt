========================================

Without thou me in thy secret place there may I find your mercy and grace. Place your seal up my heart's door. I may not sing against thee. Oh Lord, please hide thou me thy secret place. There may I find your mercy grace. Place your seal above my heart. I would not sin against thee, oh Lord. Place your sill upon my heart that I would not sin against thee, oh Lord. How alone I was feeling [Music] and the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Though I laughed and said my life was fine without you. I was covering up those secret tears. I cried. But then one day someone told me of your mercy and the love you showed on a hill called Calary. Oh there you died to purchase my redemption. who broke sin power and set my spirit free. I'm amazed that you love me. Lord, I'm amazed at how you care. Through your preious blood, I found pardoning. And my sins are washed. They've all been washed away. My sins are washed away. Yes, it's true. There's been days when I failed you. [Music] Lord, you know the times I've gone astray. But Lord, I've learned your love is stronger than my weakness. When your ears are open every time I pray, no one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. No other friend could ever be as close to me. I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. Only you are everything I'll ever need. Oh, [Music] God. I'm amazed at how you care. It's through your preious blood I found pardon. [Music] My sins are washed.

And through your preious blood I found. And my sins are washed and washed away. My sins are washed away. Yes. My sins are washed. washed away. My sins are washed away. [Music] I cried out for mercy back then. I pled the blood of Jesus. I begged him to my s [Music] wept again. [Music] What city? It's as far away as the east is from the west. My child, what sin? Tell me what sin. It was gone the very minute you confessed in the sea. of forgetfulness. [Music] The heaviest load you'll carry is a load of guilt and shame. You were never meant to bear it. So give it up in my Jesus name. Our God is slow to anger. He is quick to forgive our sins. and put it under the blood. Don't bring it up again. Cuz he'll say, "What sin? What sin?" As far away as the east is from the west. [Music] What sin? What sin? It was gone the very minute you confessed. [Music] It's buried in the sea of forgetfulness. Amen. Are you glad your sins are buried in the sea of forgetfulness? Amen. Let's start off by opening the service up with a word of prayer. We have some some prayer requests here. It says, "Please continue to remember the Fairweather family in prayer as Rob is in his last and final stages of life." Then we got from Sister Carol, prayer for my South Dakota family. Lost a young cousin to suicide. also for nephew JJ who had a liver transplant. He now needs a kidney. Then let's continue to remember Shalona as she's recovering from her surgery and then my my grandma had the same surgery. And then um my dad his tailbone and brother Miguel. Do you mind? It's good to have sister Loretta and baby Olly with us here tonight. [Applause] [Music] Amen. You love him here this evening. Amen. Let's just bow our heads as we go to the Lord in prayer. [Music] Father, we just want to let you know that we love you here this evening. Father, that we're appreciative of everything that you do. And Lord, we're thankful for God, the blessings that you've given to us in our lives. And Lord, I would just ask that here this evening that Lord, that you would see your sons, your daughters, Lord, the people that love you. And that we just take this moment of our day, Lord, and just give you praise and just worship you, Father, and just give you glory and honor, Lord, because you're worthy. Father, I would just ask that you would see these requests that have been made, Lord. The different ones that aren't feeling well and the ones that are in South Dakota that need you, Father.

Not only that, but Lord, there's hands that are in this building that are lifted up. Father, they need you. not only us in this building, but Lord, this world needs you, Lord. And and I would ask, God, that your presence would be welcome. Be welcome in the hearts of those that need you. I would just pray that you would strengthen them, Father.

God good here tonight. We're the redeemed. As we sing this next song, just step out and greet one another. I am thinking of a rapture in our blessed home on high when the redeemed are gathering in. How we'll raise the heavenly anthem in that city in the sky. When the redeemed are gathering in. When the redeemed are gathering in, wash like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout and how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in. There will be a great procession over on the streets of gold when the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, what music? Oh, what singing? Oh, the city will be rolled. When the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, when the redeems are gathering in, washed like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout and how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in. Saints will sing redemption story with their voices clear and strong. When the redeemed are gathering in, then the angels all will listen. For they cannot join that song. When the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, when the redeemed are gathering in, [Music] wash like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout and how we'll see him when the redeemed are gathering in. Then the savior will give orders to prepare the rain and prepar when the redeemed are gathering in. And we'll hear the great ye blessed of the Lord when the redeemed are gathering in. When the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout. I will sing. When the redeemed are gathering in. When the redeemed are gathering in. Washed like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout and how we'll sing. When the redeemed are gathering in. Sing that again as brother Harry brings his special names are gathering in. Washed like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout. How we'll sing. When the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, when the redeemed are gathering in, washed like snow and free from all sin. How will shout and how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in. Amen. Are you part of that redeemed here tonight? &gt;&gt; After brother Harry, if sister April would bring her special [Music] All the things that I have in my [Music] disappear. [Music] riches and all that come [Music] I gain if my soul I don't want to lose what the world does. I only want you. I only want you. First things first, I seek your will, not my own. Surrender all my wants to you and keep the first thing first to live your truth and walk your ways. Set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you. All my desires reverse to keep the first things first.

Lord, I fix my face on you. All my desires reversed to keep the first things first. [Music] [Applause] sir. Glory to God. [Music] [Music] When the solid ground is falling down from underneath my feet, between the black skies and my red eyes, I can barely see. And when I feel like I've been let down by my friends and my family, I can hear the rain reminding me. In the eye of the storm, you remain in control. In the middle of the war, you guard my soul. You alone are the anchor when my sails are torn. Your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm. [Music] When my hopes and dreams are far from me and I'm running out of faith, I see the future. I pictured slowly fade away. And when the tears of pain and heartache are pouring down my face, I find my peace in Jesus name. In the eye of the storm, you remain in control. In the middle of the war, you guard my soul. You alone are the anchor. When my sails are torn, your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm. [Music] when they let me go. And I just don't know how I'm going to make ends meet. I did my best and now I'm scared to death that we might lose everything. And when a sickness takes my child away and there's nothing I can do, &gt;&gt; my only hope is to trust you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I trust you, Lord. In the eye of the storm, you remain in control. In the middle of the war, you guard my soul. You alone are the anchor. When my sails are torn, your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm. You alone are the anchor and my sails are torn.

I'm not giving up. know I'll keep holding on. Oh yes, I've been walking through this valley, through this veil of tears. Sometimes I've even questioned if my Lord was even near me. Then at times that old tempter, he says, "Why not turn around? Cuz you can't go any further and you're only losing ground." But I'm not here. I'm not turning round. [Music] By the grace of God, I wear a shining crown. Someday going to keep holding on to those nail scarred hands. I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep holding. Oh, listen to this verse. Oh, would you mind tell me? There's something bothering me. Why is it that old devil, he won't just let God's people be? Oh, he's bound and determined to get right in the way to turn our ways from the way of life and lead our souls astray. But I'm not giving up. I'm not turning round.

Is that the way you feel tonight? Hallelujah. How many feels like praising him tonight? Amen. Amen. God bless you. Now, if you have your Bibles, I'd like to turn to Psalms 150 and verse one. Like to say, it's good to be in the house of the Lord here tonight and appreciate Brother Caleb taking the uh the song service tonight. Amen. Thought he did a good job and enjoyed all the specials. Amen. Psalms 150 and verse one. I know it's a Wednesday night, so I'm not going to keep you long. You know that. So, we'll get right into it if we can. Um, but it says, "Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts. &gt;&gt; Praise him according to his excellent greatness." Amen. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet and praise him with the the psalm tree and harp. Praise him with the timberal and dance. Praise him with the stringed instruments in the organ. Praise him upon the loud symbols. Amen. Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. I love this next part. Just help me say it. Let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord. Amen. Can we also turn to Psalms 113 and verse one? Then we'll let you all have your your seats tonight. Verse 1-6 says, "How long will thou forget me, oh Lord, forever? How long will thou hide thy face from me? How long shalt I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? How long shall my enemies be exalted over me? Consider and hear me, oh Lord my God. Lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death, lest my enemies say, I have prevailed against him, and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. But I have trusted in thy mercy, and my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. May the Lord just add his blessing to the reading of the word as you're being seated here tonight. And if I had a a very simple text here tonight, it would be from from sadness to singing. From sadness to singing. And it has been said that songs and and music are are language of the soul. How many can say that? And brother Brandham says here there's there's nothing like music. You know, God heals by music. Did you know that? Uh-huh. God heals by music. He also says here in the same message of look, he says sometime when you feel all down and as we call it, a street expression down in the dump. See, just put on one of those tapes and that music or record and go to playing it. The first thing you know, you're patting your foot or your hand and it's all over. Then you're right up and ready to go. So we see that music has the power to change your environment. It it has the power to change your atmosphere to a a negative state. It can also change your environment or your atmosphere to a a positive state as well. They say music has the ability to to quicken the heart rate. It it it can cause you to relax. They say music can alter your mood. It it can cause you to feel depressed or it can cheer you up. They said music can excite your emotions or it can help you meditate upon the Lord. It it can cause anxiety or it can relieve anxiety. And whether we realize IT OR NOT, MUSIC DOES AFFECT THE BODY. &gt;&gt; It affects the spirit man as well. That's why it's so important to listen to the right kind of music. Ain't that right? And and you you look at the world today, it's it's always in a a state of rage, &gt;&gt; always in a state of of anger. AND WHAT WHY IS THAT? You wonder. It's the music that they listen to. The rap and the the hip-hop and the heavy metal is affecting that spirit man. &gt;&gt; It's causing THAT SPIRIT MAN TO ALWAYS BE IN AN UPROAR. DO you really think if you're fighting a a spirit, let's say, of depression or anxiety, putting on on rock and roll music, IS IT GOING TO CALM THAT SPIRIT DOWN? &gt;&gt; What is it going to do to that spirit IS GOING TO CAUSE IT TO GET EVEN STRONGER IN YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; MUSIC IS SO IMPORTANT TO BEING delivered and being set free. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, WE MUST ASK THE RIGHT KIND OF QUESTIONS. HOW HOW DOES IT AFFECT ME EMOTIONALLY? And what about physically? How does it affect me mentally and AND SPIRITUALLY? &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT KIND OF music I that you're listening to is not helping you, I wouldn't listen to it anymore. I'm I'm building a foundation here because listening to that TYPE OF MUSIC, IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LISTEN TO that kind of music, it opens you up to other spirits. &gt;&gt; Music carries spirits. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? And why would I WANT TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING THAT THAT IS GOING TO hurt my spiritual health? &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about music. And as a matter of fact, I'm I'm getting somewhere with this, that music was important to the people of Israel. They they sang and they played musical instruments as they marched into battle. That after every war that they won, they sang again. &gt;&gt; We look at Exodus 15:1. says, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously, and the horse and his rider have been thrown into the sea. THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH AND my song." Amen. And he has become my salvation, and he is my God, and I will prepare for him a habitation, my father's God, and I will exalt him. So we SEE THAT MUSIC IS POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. David played music to soothe the heart of King Saul when he was being tormented by an evil spirit. And we see that that evil spirit will leave Saul for a while. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Years later, David was needing encouragement. And he was fighting depression and he WAS HE WAS SUFFERING EMOTIONALLY because he was in a state of despair. And we see that in Psalms 13, we heard that this man is crying desperately FOR GOD TO HELP HIM in that situation that he's in. And and he was he was IN A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT FELT LIKE THAT HE COULDN'T make it any longer. &gt;&gt; And there may be people tonight, I DON'T KNOW, I I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES WHERE I GET TO THE END OF MY ROAD AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T MAKE IT ANY ANY LONGER. OR MAYBE I'VE BEEN TROUBLED IN MY SPIRIT OR OR MAYBE I'M STRESSED TO THE LIMIT OR WORK IS NOT THERE OR TRYING TO FIND THE NEXT JOB OR MAYBE WE HAVE FAMILY PROBLEMS OR MONEY PROBLEMS. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL IN THAT STATE AND WE DWELL ON THAT STATE OF MIND, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? It can lead to depression. &gt;&gt; It can lead TO ANXIETY. AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU CAN ALLOW THINGS TO COME INTO THAT STATE OF MIND THAT CAN BRING SPIRITS INTO YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, what you listen to, WHAT YOU FEED UPON IS WHAT YOU WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME. &gt;&gt; BUT WE SEE THAT DEPRESSION IS IS HAVING A FIELD day today. &gt;&gt; IT'S ATTACKING ALL AGES AND AND CULTURES. IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A MAN OR OR A WOMAN, A BOY, OR GIRL. DEPRESSION IS RUNNING RAPID TODAY. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THAT DEPRESSION is a spirit. &gt;&gt; BUT I'VE COME TO TELL YOU TONIGHT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE DOWN TO THAT SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER DEPRESSION. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER DESPAIR. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, ON FIRE AND ANXIETY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THAT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; In that time, it may feel like everything's against you. If I can TELL YOU SOMETHING, BEGIN TO WORSHIP the Lord. &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT, &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU DON'T, whether you see the bills paid, WHETHER YOU'RE BEHIND, WHETHER YOU HAVE HEALING IN THE BODY, OR WHETHER YOU'RE FIGHTING A SICKNESS, YOU BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD. IT'S IN THOSE MOMENTS THAT YOU BEGIN TO SHOW GOD THAT HE'S STILL IN CONTROL. NO MATTER IF YOU FEEL IT OR YOU DON'T, GOD IS STILL IN CONTROL. &gt;&gt; And you BEGIN TO SHOW HIM THAT I WILL TRUST YOU NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL THROWS AT ME THAT IN THIS STATE OF MIND THAT I WILL PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WORSHIP IS POWERFUL. WORSHIP CAN BRING A DELIVERANCE to a home. You say, "BROTHER KOBE, MY MARRIAGE IS IS NOT WORKING OUT." BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD FOR HAVING A RESTORED MARRIAGE. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, MY CHILD IS IS WEWARD." BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD LIKE HE'S ALREADY RESTORED THAT SON OR DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR TRUST IN GOD AND SHOWING THAT I WILL TRUST YOU IN the good times and the bad times. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; but it's not a a good feeling when you feel like nobody cares &gt;&gt; and you FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN FORGOTTEN or forsaken and it AND IT FEELS LIKE YOUR PRAYERS THAT YOU'VE BEEN CRYING OUT FROM A DESPERATE HEART IS JUST HITTING A GLASS CEILING. How many's ever been there? &gt;&gt; And we see that that's how David felt. He's he's struggling with depression. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh my. One thing I'm so glad that we serve a God that THAT THAT DOESN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; That he knows who you are. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE STATE OF MIND THAT YOU'RE IN. HE HE KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE. HE KNOWS YOUR NAME AND HE KNOWS YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching from experience ON THIS. I'VE BEEN IN THOSE TIMES WHERE I FOUGHT DEPRESSION SO HEAVILY WHERE I FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO CONSUME MY LIFE. AND THE ONLY THING THAT I COULD DO WAS CALL OUT TO A GOD THAT CARES. &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES WHERE NOBODY ELSE CARES. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S TIMES WHERE YOU FEEL ALONE, BUT GOD HAS NOT FORSAKEN YOU IN THOSE TIMES. HE'S TURNING YOUR SADNESS INTO SINGING HERE TONIGHT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I I FEEL THIS. I NEED A HEALING." WHY DON'T YOU BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE AT TONIGHT AND WATCH GOD COME UP ON THE SCENE. PRAISE. PRAISE WILL BREAK THE CHAINS IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; As the SONG SAYS, PRAISE IS WHAT BRINGS THE WALLS OF Jericho down. &gt;&gt; Praise is the one that delivered the children of Israel THAT BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AND GOD HEARD THEIR CRY AND GOD CAME UPON THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; Oh my Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we see David is talking here in Psalms 13 and1 AND HE SAYS, "HOW LONG WILL THOU FORGET ME, oh Lord? Oh my, forever. HOW LONG WILL THOU HIDE THY FACE FROM ME?" And it is believed that during this time when WHEN DAVID WROTE THIS PSALM THAT he was running from Saul &gt;&gt; AND FROM THE MEN OF SAUL, THEY WERE HUNT DAVID LIKE AN ANIMAL. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we begin to SEE THAT DAVID CAME CLOSE TO DEATH MANY TIMES AND HE'S SOMEHOW MANAGED TO ESCAPE. NOW HE'S WEARY AND HE'S DRAINED PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. HE'S HE'S BEEN RUNNING ON FUMES. OH MY, how many's been there? &gt;&gt; AND DURING THIS TIME OF DESPERATION, HE CRIES OUT FOR HELP. AND HE ASKS, "GOD, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME? GOD, DO YOU SEE ME IN MY time of need?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I need an answer. &gt;&gt; God, I I I NEED I NEED MY BILLS PAID. &gt;&gt; LORD, I' I I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS THIS THIS MENTAL WARFARE. GOD, I I NEED HELP. GOD HEARS THE CRY OF HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED THAT IF YOU JUST CRY OUT THAT HE WILL DELIVER YOU. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE BEEN TIRED FROM FIGHTING DAY IN AND DAY OUT. WE'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED. WE'VE WE'VE HAD FAILURES. We've suffered losses. &gt;&gt; We have felt isolated. AND WE'VE BEEN WE WONDER, GOD, why would YOU ALLOW US TO GET HERE? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can give a little word of encouragement here tonight. God is here and he wants to pick you up. &gt;&gt; God wants to ENCOURAGE YOU. GOD WANTS to lift a feeble hand. Oh my. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TONIGHT, I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A SHOT IN THE ARM AND LET YOU KNOW YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN FORSAKEN, BUT GOD HAS NOT forsaken you. &gt;&gt; WE GET IN OUR STATE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT IT JUST IF THE DEVIL FIGHTS US IN OUR MIND SAYING YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE, &gt;&gt; SAYING THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU AND NO ONE LOVES YOU AND YOU HAVE BEEN FORSAKEN EVEN BY GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT IF WE CAN EVER GET IN A IN A RIGHT FRAME OF MIND, YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND KNOW THAT THE GOD THAT WE PUT OUR TRUST IN, HE'S NOT HE'S NOT FEEBLE LIKE MAN, &gt;&gt; HE NEVER GROWS TIRED AND WEARY. &gt;&gt; OH, &gt;&gt; but he wants to heal you. &gt;&gt; And he's the only one that can. &gt;&gt; The world turns to medication. And the world TURNS TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. THEY turn to affairs and not realizing that the one thing that they need is standing before them. &gt;&gt; THE ONE THING THAT WON'T GIVE HIM A HANGOVER. &gt;&gt; The one thing that WON'T GET HIM ADDICTED TO DRUGS, THE ONE THING THAT WON'T LEAVE him with A BROKEN MARRIAGE IS STANDING BEFORE HIM. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO HEAL, BUT YOU HAVE TO CRY OUT IN DESPERATION. &gt;&gt; YOU have to GET TO A STATE WHERE YOU'RE TIRED of living in THAT SAME CONDITION. YOU KNOW, I may have been preaching this. I preached this before, but I'm preaching it AGAIN TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO HELP HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; God wants to turn your sadness into singing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But even with the Holy Ghost, life is still life. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're still going to go through struggles. &gt;&gt; We're going to go through sorrow and loss. &gt;&gt; We will go through disappointments. I wish that we lived in a perfect world. &gt;&gt; I wish that we can wake up every day and and not be offended by this person or fight sicknesses. I wish that we could have that. But we're not there yet. Until then, my heart will go on singing. &gt;&gt; UNTIL I SEE MY SALVATION &gt;&gt; AND UNTIL I SEE THE REWARDS, UNTIL I I MAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE, MY HEART, NO MATTER HOW DEVASTATED I MAY FEEL, &gt;&gt; I WILL GO MORE REJOICING AND PRAISING GOD LIKE I ALREADY HAVE the answer. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I can do all things through Christ &gt;&gt; who gives me strength." And it's through those difficult times in life that God will give you strength to get through it. &gt;&gt; How many's ever prayed and it feels like you couldn't find God? &gt;&gt; Am I the only one? &gt;&gt; David felt like he couldn't find God. And he felt like in this Psalms 13, he he felt like God had forgotten about him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And his heart begins to cry out, "God, how long are you going to forget about me? &gt;&gt; Well, will it be forever?" But through all this, David never gave up on God. AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR LIFE, however you feel, don't give up on God. &gt;&gt; David didn't understand what was going on, but he knew a God that wouldn't leave him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't that right here tonight? &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Rejoice in your tribulation." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's &gt;&gt; skip through some of this here so we can &gt;&gt; go through this quicker. But Psalms 13:2 says, "How long shall I counsel in my soul &gt;&gt; and have sorrow in my heart and daily? How long shall my enemies be exalted &gt;&gt; over me?" David is telling us something here. He's telling us that we we we must not counsel in ourselves. young people, we do need the counsel of elders. &gt;&gt; WE DO NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE THAT has been there before. &gt;&gt; Isolation, we've talked about it before, but isolation will destroy you. &gt;&gt; And when you feel like you're all alone, it's the time to reach out to someone that's been there before. &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But when we START FEELING LIKE GOD HAS FORSAKEN US AND OR LET US DOWN, REMEMBER something that HE IS THE ONE THAT'S TOUCHABLE and approachable when we're struggling with the feelings of infirmity. HEBREWS 4:15 TELLS US THAT HE WAS TEMPTED in all areas as a man, &gt;&gt; yet without sin. &gt;&gt; JESUS FELT WHAT YOU GOING are going through here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; JESUS HAS HAS FELT LIKE HE WAS FORSAKEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. On the cross in Matthew 27 and 46, it says about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying, "My God, &gt;&gt; my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" &gt;&gt; And because Jesus suffered and endured, NOW HE GIVES US THE STRENGTH in our times of trouble. Hebrews 2:18 says, "For in that he has suffered being tempted, he is able to secure them that are tempted." Come on, somebody. 2 Corinthians 4:8 says, "We are troubled ON EVERY SIDE, YET NOT DISTRESSED." &gt;&gt; WE ARE PERPLEXED, BUT NOT IN DESPAIR. PERSECUTED, BUT NOT FORSAKEN. &gt;&gt; PERSECUTED, BUT NOT FORSAKEN. CAST DOWN BUT NOT DESTROYED. [Applause] AMEN. &gt;&gt; SATAN CAN'T DESTROY YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE FEELING LIKE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE AT THE END OF THE ROAD, BUT YOU CANNOT BE DESTROYED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOUR BODY MAY BE TELLING YOU IT'S TIME TO GIVE IN. &gt;&gt; YOUR MIND MAY BE TELLING YOU IT'S TIME TO GIVE UP. &gt;&gt; BUT IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT, THERE IS A STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT be destroyed. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Paul is telling us THAT THAT THINGS ARE NOT AS BAD as they seem to be. We see the three HEBREW BOYS SUFFERED THE FIERY FURNACE, BUT THEY WERE NOT DESTROYED. &gt;&gt; DANIEL SUFFERED THE LION'S DEN, BUT HE WAS NOT DESTROYED. &gt;&gt; Peter suffered threats and in the jail cell, but he wasn't destroyed. HALLELUJAH. HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS IT LOOKS. YOU MAY BE SUFFERING, BUT YOU CANNOT be destroyed here tonight. WHAT WAS MEANT FOR EVIL, GOD HAS TURNED IT FOR YOUR good here tonight. If God before you, if God before you, who can be against you here tonight, &gt;&gt; my goodness, &gt;&gt; we see that David was going through a difficult time in his life. So, he began to sing. Psalms 13:5 says, "But I trusted in thy mercy and my heart will rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me IN SPITE OF TRIALS AND AND BURDENS AND disappointments in life. You have a song that's on your heart." And I'm talking about a song that's that's unexplainable. How is Brother Marorrow and SISTER LEE AND MY WIFE AND SISTER AMY ABLE TO GO THROUGH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH &gt;&gt; AND STILL THROUGH IT ALL COUNT GOD FAITHFUL? &gt;&gt; How is it that grandpa has been struggling with Parkinson's for year after year? &gt;&gt; And still HE HAS COUNTED GOD FAITHFUL. &gt;&gt; HOW IS IT THAT GRANDMA HAS BEEN TAKING CARE OF GRANDPA THROUGH SICKNESS and in health &gt;&gt; and THROUGH IT ALL HAS COUNTED GOD FAITHFUL? WE CAN GO THROUGH EVERY PERSON HERE THAT HAS HAD THE HARDSHIPS OF LIFE. We can't EXPLAIN WHY WE STILL HAVE A SONG ON our heart. All we know is IN THE GOOD TIMES WE GIVE GOD THE PRAISE ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; If we left it UP TO OUR BODIES AND WE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT OUR SALVATION IS NOT BASED UPON HOW WE FEEL. NOT BASED UPON HOW OUR JOB IS AND HOW MUCH MONEY WE GOT IN THE ACCOUNT, BUT IT'S BASED UPON A ROCK SOLID FOUNDATION THAT THE WINDS OF HELL CANNOT DESTROY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW WE CAN SING A SONG IN THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT. THAT'S HOW WE CAN WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH AND SAY IN MY HEART, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SUBJECT UPON YOUR emotional state. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you're going to always have a song on your heart. Brother Josh, &gt;&gt; there's going to be times when you wake up when you don't want to sing, &gt;&gt; but you sing anyway. There's going to be times &gt;&gt; I've been there where you don't want to go to church &gt;&gt; and you would rather I've been there rather stay home and sleep &gt;&gt; but you go TO CHURCH ANYWAY. I FOUND OUT those services where I've had to push &gt;&gt; and I've had to press &gt;&gt; and had to COME IN AND AND FORCE MYSELF TO RAISE MY HANDS AND FORCE MYSELF to sing and force myself to enter in. Was the times where I got my breakthrough. &gt;&gt; God will reward a person that is going to come IN REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Your praise will display itself in in the most unusual times under the harshest of conditions. There is something IN YOUR HEART THAT'S READY TO BUBBLE out and give God praise. &gt;&gt; We see that Paul and Silas was in jail at the midnight hour. What do they begin to do? They begin to complain about their circumstances. Do they say, "You know what? I I really thought God was was, you know, better than this and now I'm just I don't since he's not helping me." What did they begin to do? &gt;&gt; They begin to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that God sent an earthquake that shook the place &gt;&gt; and immediately the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed. When your FAITH IS IN GOD, YOU can sing a song of praise. &gt;&gt; And people around you may not get it. They're they may have seen what you've went through. &gt;&gt; They may have seen you get chewed out BY YOUR BOSS. OR THEY MAY HAVE SEEN YOU JUST GET FIRED. OR OR they may HAVE JUST SEEN YOUR CAR IS HAVING PROBLEMS AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Your car is DEAD AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, BUT YOU'RE PRAISING THE LORD. WHAT IS CAUSING THIS? &gt;&gt; THE world doesn't understand it. Oh my. Trust in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Trust is the deepest. I hope this is okay tonight. &gt;&gt; In order to fully believe in God and have faith in God, we must trust &gt;&gt; that he has everything under control. Sometimes it's it's hard to do that because we want to do it ourselves, right? We we we we sometimes it's hard for man to let go of the reigns. &gt;&gt; We like to be in control. We we we want to do it our way and figure things out OUR WAY. BUT GOD WANTS YOU to trust in him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm almost done. And I pray this is okay here tonight. &gt;&gt; But we see here that David was crying out to God in his in his circumstance. And &gt;&gt; he's saying here, Lord, Psalms 51:11 says, "Cast me not away &gt;&gt; from thy presence, oh my, that's my prayer. &gt;&gt; And take not thy holy spirit from me &gt;&gt; and restore Restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit. The song of David's heart was a heart of praise and rejoicing. &gt;&gt; We see that this verse came right after David committed adultery with Basheba. And we begin to see how how God was dealing with David. And David comes out and says, "Cast me not away." &gt;&gt; God's mercy is always there. &gt;&gt; And even in this state of mind, he still had a heart of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're always going to have something within you. &gt;&gt; What has kept you? Honestly, I know I keep referring back to brother Merlin and sister Leah, but what has kept you &gt;&gt; through this time? Seeing my wife and how she goes through it and there's times where she'll cry and what has kept you through this time. &gt;&gt; It wasn't your ability. If it was left up to man, I would imagine they would have already ran off. But it was God that has kept him. &gt;&gt; I don't understand how brother Merl could sometimes get up here. I wish I had his energy, but it's &gt;&gt; he's singing from a heart that puts his trust in God. That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't understand why we go through things in life, &gt;&gt; but we know who holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We know that that we we don't know WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE TOMORROW, but we got a God &gt;&gt; that keeps YOU IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; OH, I wish I could portray it like I see it tonight. Oh my. He gives us a a song of praise. And whether you can sing or or can't sing, sometimes you got to just get it out. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm almost done here tonight. Skip through some of this here. Psalms 96:E1 says, "Oh, sing unto the Lord a new song and and sing unto the Lord all the earth. Sing unto the Lord and bless his name. Show forth his salvation from day to day. I I've come to tell you it's time that we stop belly aching and sing. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME THAT WE STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH and begin to rejoice in the Lord. IT'S IT'S TIME THAT WE STOP GRIPING AND BEGIN TO SING. IT'S TIME THAT WE START START singing to the Lord &gt;&gt; because he's given us a song. Psalms 98:1 says, "Oh, sing unto the Lord a new song. &gt;&gt; For he hath done marvelous things." How many can say that tonight? &gt;&gt; His right hand and his holy arm has gotten him the victory. &gt;&gt; The Lord has made known his salvation. His righteousness has he openly showed in the sight of the heathen. Revelations 14:3 says, "And they sang as it were a new song before the throne &gt;&gt; and before the four beasts and the elders, and no man can learn that song, but the 140 and 4,000 which were redeemed FROM THE EARTH." NOBODY CAN SING YOUR SONG here tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As the song says, YOU DON'T KNOW LIKE I KNOW &gt;&gt; WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S BROUGHT ME FROM. WHAT HE'S DELIVERED ME FROM. YOU DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I come to church WHETHER I FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT AND SING BECAUSE HE HAS DONE SOMETHING FOR ME. &gt;&gt; OH MY. NOBODY CAN SNUFF IT OUT. YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL for here tonight. Revelations 5:9 says, "And they sang A NEW SONG. THOU ARE worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation here tonight. If I can say it, it's time to rejoice. &gt;&gt; REJOICE IN the Lord always. And again, I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David realized that he had a lot to be thankful for. And I came across this quote today and I I thought it was pretty good. I'm cutting in here. But brother Brandham says, "He's my friend when I am broke. &gt;&gt; He's my friend when I got plenty. Oh my. &gt;&gt; I love him when I'm hungry. &gt;&gt; And I love him when I'm filled. I love him when I'm in sorrow. &gt;&gt; I love him when I am happy. I love him because he first loved me. HE SAYS WHEN I AM SICK AND DYING, he's my friend. WHEN I AM FEELING GOOD TONIGHT AND HAPPY, HE'S STILL MY FRIEND. WHEN I'M LAYING YONDER DYING SOMEWHERE AND MY CHILLY veins are COMING UP MY ARM LIKE THAT, he will be my friend. And when these brittle THREADS THAT I'M WALKING ON breaks and plunges them into eternity, he'll be my friend then, too. WHEN THE AGES ROLLED ON ABOUT 10,000 YEARS AND YOU SUNG YOUR JUBILEE SONG, HE'LL still be your friend then. He says, "Yes, sir. When there's no moon and no more sun and no more earth, he'll still be your friend." Hallelujah. And I'm here TO TELL YOU TONIGHT, HE'S YOUR FRIEND. &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU FEEL IT OR NOT, HE'S YOUR FRIEND HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I love it. When I'm broke, I'm so glad he's still my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the musicians come here tonight, Psalms 107 and8 says, "Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness &gt;&gt; and for his wonderful works to the children of men." Do you love him here tonight? &gt;&gt; Can you hit G? Oh, praise him. Oh, praise him. Praise him in the morning. Praise him in the noon. Praise him. Oh, praise him. Oh, praise him. When the sun goes down, I will serve him. Oh, serve him. Serve him in the morning. Serve him in the moon. Serve him. Oh, serve him. Serve him when the sun goes down. Oh, I've got a right to praise the Lord. I've got a right to lift my voice. Oh, ain't nobody got to ride like the children of the Lord and see the light. I've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. I've got a ride for you. When he saved my soul, you ought to have been there. When he put my name on the road, I start walking. I start talking. I start singing. And I start shouting about what the Lord has done for me. You ought to be there. Oh, you ought to be there and save my soul. Oh, you want to be there when you put my name on. I started walking.

Oh, I feel like praising praise him. I feel like praising praising him. Oh, praise him in the morning. Praise him all the Lord. Oh, I feel God. Praise him. Praise him. Well, now why don't you praise the Lord while you have a chance? How about it tonight? Oh, why don't you praise the Lord while you have a chance? Oh, praise him in the morning. Praise him all the Oh, I feel I praise him. Praise him. You ought to be there. Oh, you ought to be there. When you save my soul. Oh, you ought to be there. Thank you, Lord. When you put my name on the road, I start walk. I started talking. I started singing and I start shouting and I walk the Lord. Singing out if you turn to a pastor. Oh, you ought to be there. You save my soul. Oh, you are there. You put my name on the road. I start walking. I start talking. I start singing. I start shouting. I what the Lord has done. You ought to be there. Oh, you ought to be there. [Music] [Applause] I started walking. I started singing. I started shouting about what THE LORD. OH, LET'S sing it again. You ought to be there when he saved my soul. You ought to be there when he put my name on the road. Yes. I started talking. I started talking. I started singing. I started shouting about what the Lord has done for me. Well, I started walking. I started talking. I started singing. I started shouting about what the Lord. [Music] [Applause] Oh, somebody shout hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. They used to always have those Amen. The Old Testament would bring those not those singers out. They would come and sing before the Lord. So many times the Lord would say, "You don't have to fight this battle. Just leave your swords at home." Amen. Just come out with a praise. Come out with singing and worship. That's what God's looking for. Hallelujah. Miracles can take place in our worship, brother. I I believe that. Amen. And I I believe that, you know, we uh we we get that Molly grub uh uh around and you know, just we we we get we get to sulking and mlly rubbing and and and uh you know it just it it just makes it makes things worse. And I don't care how sick you are. Amen. Ignore that thing and ignore the er and just start praising the Lord. ignore those things and say, "God, I I'm I'm going to look to you." Praise the Lord. Er's got its place. Amen. Doctors have got its place. But praise should always be on our lips. Pray. It's the state of heart. Now, as long as it's right here, then it's it's Hallelujah. But the state of heart, you are an overcomer not because of your mind. And you're an overcomer because of that bornagain soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the soul say so. Can you say amen? Can you say so here tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, well, I need some counseling or well, I need a loan. Well, I need what you need. Amen. Is more of Jesus. and and and and the and the the original scripture that he right at the beginning of the message was, Amen. I'm going to create an environment. I'm going to create a habitation. Amen. And what was he talking about? Praise. I'm going to bring my heart into this thing. Amen. So that he can come down in my situation. Amen. I was I was telling our our singers, our musicians on the way, uh you know, tonight we we pray every service and I said, you know, Amen. I I want the supernatural.

We want to keep um brother Mitch and and his whole family in our prayer. You know, as it's been um mentioned here already tonight, but uh you know, brother Mitch and the grandchildren living so far away from um his dad and um just not uh you know uh around here. If you've got your dad close by, you can go see him or you can go and you be there. But with him being um amen hundreds and hundreds of miles apart and and um uh we just want to really pray for for first of all pray for his dad and um but but I want us to keep our our brother Mitch, the whole Farweather family in our in our prayers as as um his dad's on hospice and and so we just we just uh just the Lord would just be with them and and be with him and and uh we we you know, listen, we've all got to go sometime, you know, we do. And that sounds that that sounds uh cruel and and heartless, but that's why we're Christians. That's why we've accepted because that's the only that's the only way out. Death is the doorway to eternity. And um and but we we we want to know that that Mitch's dad is saved and that he's ready to go and and he's been claiming his dad for a long time. And we're clinging we're clinging to that promise. Amen. If you believe then Amen. Uh all that you love and all that's loved you and and so we're we're believing for that. We've got our fall fellowship that is coming up. And uh if uh and if that weather didn't just want to want to come on our rain on our parade. Amen. I told Caleb in the office, do not sing any song about rain tonight. I don't want to hear no songs about rain. Amen. Not even Holy Spirit rain or anything. Amen. And uh don't sing that song. Send us the rain, Lord. And we don't want that. Let's continue to pray that um you know, we put we put some things out. It's supposed to be uh supposed to be raining Friday, Saturday, and and um and there's a big chance for Sunday. So, uh, let's just let's just pray that that the Lord would would, um, would help us there. How many believes how many believes the Lord can just move the rain? &gt;&gt; You know, we had rain. Uh, I remember when we were, Brother Wayne had flew down and his dad had come there. Everyone, we had the equipment here to do the to do our yard. And, uh, they get out here and it's just dropping those big old rain. It is dark. Amen. And and uh you know they were asking, "Well, well, which way you want to go, Brother Windle?" I said, "You guys are here and we're putting in a parking lot." And uh I said, "Let's just let's just go at it." And so we we were we were going and and uh uh I I remember us over o over across the street over there uh eating and uh the ladies had brought some food out and and and it was oh it was dark. Y'all y'all remember that how dark it was and there was that it was and it was sprinkling and we were praying and and u did you know that that that right as we got through taking our break there was a little just a little part in the sky out here that opened up just a little part and did you know that that it didn't leave it didn't leave Oklahoma it went around our area the little town of Ponyie just skirted around us. And uh sister sister Leah was was looking at it on the phone and she says, "Look at this." And it was showing that it was going around and uh it it went all of these towns all around us. And they say that it dumped over 2 in on them. And all of these little towns, we're talking about Morrison, uh, uh, Skiy, all of these towns around around Pawnie, they got dumped on. They got our portion. Hallelujah. And we did not get any rain. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. And then there was another story of the flip side and I don't know if we should tell that story or not because it has to do with rain coming instead of rain going away. But brother Merl and Sister Leah, they they were out there. What the fires were right up next to them and the these fires were going and going. Uh they were they had they had licked up acres, hundreds of acres, and they couldn't put it out. They couldn't put it out. We we had fire had come all the way up to Pawnee and um uh I mean you just couldn't do it. And so brother Merl was out there with his water hose and and they were they were out there. It was it was bad. But we got together and started praying and there was no and and and back to the back to the weatherman again. No clouds in the sky. There was nothing there. Amen. But the Lord &gt;&gt; 0% &gt;&gt; zero 0% chance of rain. And Sister Leah got on the on on on the on the text there and says, "We need a miracle." And we stopped and we started praying and um a cloud came out of nowhere. Now, they had been fighting this fire for weeks. came out of nowhere and put the fire out before it got to brother Merl, Sister Le. HALLELUJAH. WELL, I I just I just say when we just start thanking God and just believing that he's pretty big, we're pretty insignificant, but he's pretty big. And I don't want to ever bring him down to my level. We don't need an insignificant God. We need a big God and we just want to keep him big and keep us little. Can you say amen? God richly bless you, Sister Lona. Amen. We're praying for you and uh Amen. And we're we're glad that she came through her surgery just fine and and so thankful for that. Praise the Lord.

And um you know these these kinds of things tear homes apart. They they they tear faith. But there's something that's anchored in in our souls that are are very real. And and we know that Adam is not dead. Adam is waiting. And neither is your baby. He's not in that grave. He's waiting on you to come.
