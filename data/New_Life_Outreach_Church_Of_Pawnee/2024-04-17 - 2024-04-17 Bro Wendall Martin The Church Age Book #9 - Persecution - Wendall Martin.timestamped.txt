[32:08] tough and so uh you know I tell them I
[32:11] said if you've got it available use it
[32:13] but uh but uh these uh sister uh these
[32:17] sister Stephanie did not do that and
[32:20] then um um but she said she she really
[32:23] didn't feel just a whole lot until at
[32:25] the very end and so we're we're just
[32:27] thankful for I mean she felt the
[32:29] pressure and all of that but just wasn't
[32:30] an extreme pain until the end and that's
[32:33] what we were praying for is the Lord
[32:35] would would help her and and give her a
[32:37] good delivery so if they're watching
[32:39] tonight we say God bless you brother
[32:41] Harry and sister Stephanie amen and uh
[32:45] we love them so so as as we were saying
[32:49] there Satan was is now beginning to come
[32:54] and he's and and and now we have got the
[32:58] synagogue of Satan with the and the
[33:01] synagogue of and the the the church
[33:05] themselves amen there is they are now
[33:08] claiming the same Christ they are now
[33:11] claiming the same blessings amen but one
[33:15] is following the word and the one is
[33:18] trying to appease the world because they
[33:22] were quite frankly they were tired of
[33:24] the persecution they were tired of the
[33:26] trials and the and and the things of
[33:28] that nature and so uh they they were
[33:32] they were compromising already they had
[33:34] left the life of the word and trying to
[33:37] fit in with the world trying to fit in
[33:40] with the things of of the world and so
[33:43] um we say that we and and this wasn't
[33:47] anything new because the Apostle Paul
[33:49] had already had already predicted and I
[33:52] already said there in in the Philippians
[33:55] you know he said some indeed cre uh uh
[33:57] Philippians 1 and 15 some indeed preach
[34:00] Christ even of envy and strife and some
[34:02] of good will one preached Christ of
[34:05] contention not sincerely supposing to
[34:07] add Affliction to my bonds you know uh
[34:10] but the other of love knowing that I'm
[34:12] set for the defense of the Gospel what
[34:14] then notwithstanding every way whether
[34:17] in pretense or in truth Christ is
[34:20] preached and therein I do Rejoice yay
[34:23] and Will Rejoice so and and and then we
[34:26] find that as Paul Paul is is is coming
[34:29] down to the last part of his life he's
[34:31] saying that Deus has forsaken me having
[34:33] loved this present world and his
[34:35] departed unto
[34:37] thessalonica Paul Paul brother brandham
[34:39] says this was not he was not going out
[34:41] to the bars he was not going back out
[34:42] into the world he said he simply amen he
[34:46] loved the ways of the world he loved the
[34:49] ways of man's uh um uh opinion and and
[34:55] and U um love love their um their their
[34:59] kind words over the words of God Amen
[35:03] and so this this was already a falling
[35:05] away but remember as long as the lion
[35:07] anointing was there through that Prophet
[35:10] there Satan couldn't have its way into
[35:12] the church but once the Apostle Paul had
[35:15] had had passed on now amen and he's
[35:18] given his life um he he the church the
[35:22] lion is gone and now it's the it's that
[35:25] Ox anointing that is now steing in now
[35:28] persecution is fixing to come uh with
[35:32] with great fierceness so this is where
[35:34] you're going this is where the seals and
[35:37] the church ages blend in together it was
[35:39] the lion under that first seal that that
[35:43] that was that Prophet lion the Apostle
[35:46] Paul uh was there now it's the ox that
[35:50] Ox is the
[35:51] slaughter is is is sacrificial it's an
[35:54] animal of Amen of of giving of uh you
[35:57] know giving its life and and so and even
[36:01] even the Apostle Paul you know uh there
[36:03] in second Timothy he says the Alexander
[36:05] the coppersmith has has has done me much
[36:09] evil and U you know another place he
[36:13] says no man has stood with me but all
[36:15] men have forsook me and uh then he says
[36:18] but I pray God that it might not be laid
[36:20] to their charge not with standing the
[36:22] Lord stood with me and strengthened me
[36:25] and that by my preacher might be fully
[36:27] known that all the Gentiles might hear I
[36:30] was delivered out of the mouth of the
[36:31] lion and the Lord shall deliver me from
[36:33] every evil work and will perserve me
[36:36] until his Heavenly Kingdom uh to whom be
[36:39] glory uh for all uh forever and ever and
[36:43] and so we we can see even in Galatians
[36:45] old foolish Galatians who have Bewitched
[36:47] you that you should you know leave this
[36:49] gospel of Christ to another not that
[36:51] there is another there is no other
[36:53] gospel but you are following somebody
[36:55] else and so we could see in the days of
[36:58] Paul and so as we read this last we're
[37:01] not going back over the last night's uh
[37:03] the last reading but as the last reading
[37:06] last Wednesday night we found that they
[37:07] were of the synagogue of Satan and and
[37:10] and they were bringing in the
[37:11] persecutions and so amen I want us to
[37:14] look at this now as we as we uh start
[37:17] here in page 20 uh 127 the first uh
[37:22] paragraph he says you tamper with God
[37:24] and you reap exactly what you've
[37:26] injected man ought to learn that from
[37:29] nature he has tampered with nature he
[37:31] has injected his own ideas and nature
[37:33] and rearranged the molecules Etc and now
[37:37] he's reaping a whirlwind just look how
[37:39] they have bred the chicken it ISO so
[37:42] highly bred that it is a laying machine
[37:45] uh that lays itself out it's no good for
[37:48] food is soft and poor eating they inject
[37:50] substances into the meat we eat because
[37:53] of that the human body is changing so
[37:55] the women are getting narrower in the
[37:58] hips and broader of the shoulders and
[38:00] men are getting just the
[38:02] opposite now if you fool with nature and
[38:05] get a monstrosity and a backfire What
[38:08] will what will happen if you change the
[38:10] truth into a lie the answer is you will
[38:13] breed an antichrist Godless system of
[38:16] religion that is so perverted it will
[38:18] not look like or produce uh what the
[38:21] original did the only answer that God
[38:24] has for a situation like that is the
[38:26] Lake of Fire
[38:28] the poor samian age was dying what when
[38:31] it died it never came back no age never
[38:34] comes back no Revival comes ever comes
[38:38] back it can't have the life of God in it
[38:41] by the natural
[38:43] generation it takes a regeneration from
[38:45] above this last age started with the
[38:48] fires of Pentecost Revival and they
[38:50] organized it right back instead of
[38:52] taking the word they took their own
[38:54] ideas and did what uh just what every
[38:58] age has done substituted the manual for
[39:01] the word just you step outside that
[39:03] manual and see what happens you're dying
[39:06] or you're out brother they will
[39:08] persecute you and blame it on God how
[39:11] they love their Organization no wonder
[39:14] they are the second generation
[39:16] Pentecostals and since God doesn't have
[39:18] children they are just uh children of
[39:20] their father and known by their Creeds
[39:23] and form of worship they talk about what
[39:26] used to be but they can't produce it
[39:29] once they had the lightning but about
[39:32] all the uh all that is left is the
[39:36] thunder but let them talk to you about
[39:38] the glories of their movement and they
[39:40] will say yes sir I want you to know that
[39:43] this is a move that no man started it
[39:45] came
[39:46] spontaneously the spirit fell all over
[39:48] the world yes sir we got what they had
[39:51] at Pentecost this is was not of man but
[39:54] of God then why didn't they keep it that
[39:57] way if God started it how come God
[40:01] couldn't keep it and finish it amen to
[40:03] that if God didn't write a handbook of
[40:06] Creeds and formulas and dogmas to start
[40:08] it then what right did they have to do
[40:11] that God has poured his Spirit upon
[40:14] Baptist Methodist nazarenes and Advan
[40:17] Adventist uh Presbyterian Brethren
[40:20] Church of God several names so Etc all
[40:23] these Brethren were brought up on
[40:25] different doctrines bylaws Church
[40:27] manuals Etc God swept it all to one side
[40:31] he destroyed their dispensational
[40:33] theories and restored the gifts of the
[40:35] Spirit proving that he is the same
[40:37] yesterday today and forever but did
[40:40] those Pentecostals learn their lesson
[40:42] about Organization no sir they organized
[40:46] right back and have their uh and have
[40:48] written their own textbooks by laws in
[40:51] church manual Fellowship book Etc with
[40:55] one idea in mind that is to prove that
[40:57] they now have all the truth they know
[41:00] all the truth and are therefore the
[41:02] elite of God who know the way and can
[41:04] show it under others as God's appointed
[41:07] guides they uh but they haven't got it
[41:11] they have hybridized themselves like the
[41:12] very groups they came out of if they
[41:15] want to be in the bride they are going
[41:17] to have to come out exactly as their
[41:19] forefathers did can can I hear an
[41:23] amen amen now listen God God pulled us
[41:27] out God pulled us out don't let us
[41:31] organize around our our certain beliefs
[41:34] there is nothing in a belief and and and
[41:37] a Doctrine that'll ever produce Christ
[41:41] you've got to believe the word of God
[41:45] and walk with God it's not in what you
[41:49] believe it's who you're walking with and
[41:52] that's so important amen because we can
[41:55] come I believe this I believe this I
[41:56] believe this I believe this and the
[41:58] spirit of God doesn't have any have any
[42:00] right away in your life the spirit of
[42:02] God can't convict you and and and and
[42:04] and and and and walk with you on a
[42:07] daytoday basis brother you've
[42:09] denominational IED somewhere because God
[42:12] wants to walk with his people can you
[42:16] say amen he says they're all like the
[42:19] rest the Revival is over they're trying
[42:21] to live a name and are dead they took
[42:25] organization and all the while talking
[42:27] about the spirit of God they talk about
[42:29] the evidence of the Holy
[42:30] Spirit but they forget that the devil
[42:33] can talk in tongues too the utter
[42:36] confusion of Babel is in their midst and
[42:40] they call it the spirit of God once
[42:42] again we see man telling God instead of
[42:46] God telling man now we're going to come
[42:49] back to that a little bit later on Amen
[42:51] now he's going to explain and I I I
[42:53] think this is incredible he says now you
[42:55] might desire to SC me right here for
[42:58] what I have said all right they call
[43:01] themselves Pentecostal and Full Gospel
[43:04] let them prove it at Pentecost the fire
[43:07] came in a cloud and separated over each
[43:09] of them like a tongue and fell on each
[43:11] one where is that
[43:14] fire they spoke in tongues at Pentecost
[43:16] and the people who listen understood
[43:18] where is that the whole multitude of
[43:20] Believers acted like one family
[43:23] Pentecostals are as badly divided up
[43:25] divided as any group in history
[43:27] no man Durst join himself to the early
[43:30] church only God added they have as many
[43:33] goats among them as
[43:35] any they claim to be Full Gospel but
[43:39] they can't prove it their churches are
[43:41] as empty of power as any of them if they
[43:45] are Full Gospel uh Full Gospel then we
[43:47] had better admit the Bible made a
[43:49] mistake when it describes the Full
[43:51] Gospel men at Pentecost they sing
[43:54] there's been a change in me they are
[43:56] right but the change has not been for
[43:58] the better it is time to get back to God
[44:02] they have a name that they live but are
[44:05] dead tongues isn't the evidence of
[44:09] Revival it is the evidence of death
[44:13] tongues proclaimed the evidence that the
[44:16] ceremonial religion of the Jews was over
[44:20] and that a new era had begun tongues
[44:23] today is ringing down the curtain on the
[44:26] Gentile Church ages and the the gospel
[44:29] is going back to the Jews people are
[44:31] talking about tongues heralding in a
[44:34] great spiritual move they have missed
[44:36] the boat the truth is that it is the
[44:40] writing it is writing the Finish to all
[44:43] of man's ideas programs and kingdoms the
[44:47] kingdom of God will be ushered in wake
[44:50] up people of God wake up can you say
[44:53] Amen so so what was what was taking
[44:57] place now brother brandham is taking
[44:58] this and he's and he's pointing us back
[45:01] to uh when Daniel interpreted the
[45:04] tongues when when uh when the kingdom
[45:07] was fixing to be uh ripped away from
[45:10] jerus and and and when when the when
[45:13] when there he was in his drunken stew
[45:16] and and and there he he had he had taken
[45:19] the vessels from the the holy vessels
[45:23] from the Temple of Jerusalem and he had
[45:27] taking them in and was drinking out of
[45:30] these holy
[45:31] vessels amen these were that were
[45:34] Sanctified and sacred unto God and he
[45:37] was defiling the things of God Amen and
[45:41] saying that it didn't matter and that's
[45:44] when that's when the uh and and and he
[45:47] done that on purpose in his in his
[45:50] drunken stew he says bring in those
[45:53] vessels amen until there was no
[45:55] difference between the holy and the
[45:57] profane didn't the scripture say
[45:58] something about that too amen woe to
[46:00] them that that that that that call the
[46:02] holy profane and the profane holy that's
[46:05] when amen the writing was upon the walls
[46:09] and all of The Magicians couldn't figure
[46:10] it out all of the susers couldn't figure
[46:13] it out and in fact they were all going
[46:15] to die amen but but when Daniel came out
[46:20] Daniel had the
[46:22] interpretation to to the the tongues
[46:26] that were there upon the wall and what
[46:28] did it do it pronounced
[46:30] judgment upon that Kingdom it pronounced
[46:35] this night the kingdom will be taken
[46:38] away from you so brother Ram is is is is
[46:40] putting them together and he's saying
[46:42] now when the when Pentecost came it was
[46:46] a declaration to the Jewish dispensation
[46:50] you have in fact crucified the word and
[46:54] God Has Come amen and speaking in
[46:57] tongues God is declaring you're finished
[47:00] he says now it's coming at the end of
[47:01] the Gentile dispensation and everyone is
[47:04] wanting to Rally around this and they're
[47:06] missing the full the whole point of why
[47:09] in the last days I will pour out of my
[47:12] spirit it is saying that it is a it is
[47:14] the ending of of denominationalism it's
[47:17] an ending of of World Systems it's an
[47:20] ending of and it is an ushering in of
[47:23] the great Millennium it's a it's death
[47:27] to the church but it is life unto the
[47:30] bride amen so Satan wants to come in and
[47:33] mix that up and so now we've got now you
[47:37] know when people say you know that that
[47:40] uh uh you know I've I've got the Holy
[47:43] Ghost because I speak in tongues well uh
[47:46] you know I I'm sorry but uh amen that
[47:50] that's not that show me any kind of
[47:53] scriptural evidence that speaking in
[47:56] tongues is a sign that you've got the
[47:58] Holy Ghost and I'll I'll take you back
[48:01] to to um Corinthians 1 Corinthians the
[48:05] 12th chapter and says do all work
[48:07] miracles of course no do all prophesy no
[48:11] do all speak with tongues no he's just
[48:14] he's just taken that entire chapter that
[48:17] says not all is an ear not all is an eye
[48:19] not all is this not all is that amen and
[48:22] so then he comes back around and says
[48:24] okay so it's all going to speak with
[48:28] tongues and yet the church wants to say
[48:30] that's the sign of the Holy Ghost amen
[48:33] hallelujah the scripture says that they
[48:36] will come to him in that day and I
[48:39] believe it's the people from this
[48:40] generation will come to him from the in
[48:42] that day and that will say Amen have we
[48:45] not cast out Devils have we not
[48:48] prophesied in thy name and he will say
[48:51] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[48:53] who done not the will of my father for I
[48:57] never knew
[48:59] you amen so we're we're thankful for the
[49:03] gifts and we're going to get into that a
[49:04] little bit later on as he as he goes on
[49:06] down but let's let's just continue to
[49:09] reading now he says if you don't think
[49:11] this is true then just just listen to
[49:14] this all over the world in both
[49:17] Pentecost and fundamental groups they
[49:18] are organizing the
[49:20] businessmen they have invaded the pull
[49:23] pit without a call from God they have
[49:25] styled themselves the fish ERS of men
[49:27] and founders of a move of God they say
[49:29] the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 and
[49:33] 10-13 that God gave the church has
[49:35] failed and they are taken over well
[49:38] let's praise the Lord there's some of
[49:40] that going on today here we are right in
[49:43] the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[49:45] called The Gang sayings of Kora they
[49:48] don't even know that uh that they have
[49:50] fulfilled it they are blindly going on
[49:53] preaching experience for truth may God
[49:56] have pity on it
[49:57] May their eyes be open before it is too
[49:59] late oh listen to me when did Prestige
[50:02] of money and social leadership and
[50:04] business ability and sheer mental prus
[50:07] ever qualify a man for Spiritual
[50:08] leadership or give any weight to the
[50:10] word of God when in any way materially
[50:14] or human
[50:15] values begin to show as the media by
[50:19] which God works instead of the Holy
[50:21] Spirit alone then we are fighting
[50:24] against God not for him
[50:27] now I want to I want this on record
[50:29] right here I'm not speaking against
[50:30] Elders in the church no sir and that
[50:33] Elder can be as poor as any man was ever
[50:35] poor or be the richest in the world as
[50:38] long as he's an elder in heart indeed I
[50:40] would not hesitate to ordain any man
[50:43] that has the real spiritual qualities of
[50:46] an elder or Deacon unless of regardless
[50:49] of his finances or social position when
[50:52] you see a social or financial structure
[50:55] com into the church that divides hies
[50:56] folks in any way that is not of God it
[51:00] is it is another sign of the time in uh
[51:05] uh it is another sign of the time in
[51:06] this physically rich but spiritually
[51:08] impoverished lotsy and CH age in which
[51:12] we are now living it says I Know Thy
[51:15] poverty did you notice their that their
[51:18] poverty is linked up with the synagogue
[51:20] of Satan in the same verse yes it is the
[51:24] rich powerful organization that has the
[51:27] wealth and always pushes out the little
[51:29] people that serve God when the spirit of
[51:32] God moves into the heart of men who is
[51:34] it that leaves the buildings and the
[51:36] property the little flock always loses
[51:39] out to the big organization where do the
[51:42] people go then then go they worship in
[51:45] homes old store buildings and basements
[51:47] just as they did when they were in the
[51:49] went to the catacombs these people were
[51:52] poor in the world's Goods certainly but
[51:55] they were rich in the spirit I know
[51:57] they're blasphemy Now isn't it isn't the
[52:00] thought here that these Liars are
[52:02] blaspheming God though that goes without
[52:05] saying but they are blaspheming the true
[52:08] church it all it it is always thus the
[52:12] Jews at Jerusalem blasphemed the church
[52:15] at the beginning the Gentile polytheists
[52:18] did likewise if anyone is going to be
[52:22] evil spoken of it will always be to the
[52:25] true uh the TR true seed in Nero's Day
[52:28] the Christians were blamed for every
[52:29] Calamity even for the burning of Rome in
[52:33] communist countries the little flop is
[52:35] always the first to be exterminated
[52:37] though actually insignificant in size
[52:40] though the Christians are fine loyal
[52:42] people who do only good they will always
[52:45] be persecuted to the end that they might
[52:47] be physically
[52:49] destroyed the the reason this is so is
[52:52] because they are a rebuke to the Godless
[52:56] now listen to that the reason this is so
[52:59] is because they are a rebuke to the
[53:01] Godless like a sore thumb they stand out
[53:05] before the
[53:07] wicked and and though the righteous
[53:10] intend no harm to the wicked but want to
[53:13] do only good invariably they find they
[53:16] are embroiled as the uh as as John the
[53:20] Baptist with Herod for John did not want
[53:23] to harm either Herod or his wife but to
[53:25] save them from the wrath of God this was
[53:28] not only thoroughly un misunderstood and
[53:31] absolutely withstood but John was put to
[53:34] death because of it for all the good the
[53:37] people of God do they are still put to
[53:40] public
[53:41] shame and to death surely there must be
[53:45] some Sinister force behind a people who
[53:48] would be so void of conscience that they
[53:51] would return evil to those who did them
[53:54] good yes there is such a force it is
[53:57] Satan the answer lies in the next
[54:01] verse 10 years of tribulation there in
[54:04] Revelations 2:10 fear none of those
[54:07] things which Thou shalt suffer because
[54:09] the devil behold the devil shall cast
[54:11] some of you into prison that ye may be
[54:14] tried ye have tribulation 10 days be
[54:18] thou uh faithful until the end and I
[54:21] will give thee a crown of life every
[54:23] time the Lord uses those words fear not
[54:27] there is an engagement at hand which
[54:30] will involve Great danger and suffering
[54:32] and
[54:33] deprivation now he does not say in a
[54:35] blunt Curt manner tribulation is coming
[54:38] that would frighten one but like as a
[54:41] mother who is about to turn out the
[54:43] light says gently to her child lest he
[54:46] be frightened now don't be afraid the
[54:50] light will go out and it will be dark
[54:53] but remember I am here with you so we
[54:56] says don't be afraid of man or what he
[54:59] can do to you I am with you and my grace
[55:03] is sufficient for you when you pass
[55:06] through the waters they will not
[55:08] overflow you not even in death are you
[55:11] defeated you are more than conquerors
[55:14] the great Apostle Paul knew from
[55:16] experience the reality of those words
[55:19] and he wrote in Romans 8:35
[55:22] to39 who shall separate us from the love
[55:25] of Christ shall
[55:27] tribulation and or distress or
[55:30] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[55:33] Pearl or sword as it is written for thy
[55:37] sake we are killed all the day long we
[55:39] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[55:42] nay in all these things we are more than
[55:44] conquerors through him that loved us for
[55:47] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[55:49] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[55:52] powers nor things present nor things to
[55:54] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[55:57] creature shall be able to separate us
[56:00] from the love of God which is in Christ
[56:02] Jesus our lord no we are not to fear his
[56:07] love cast out all fear aren't you glad
[56:11] for
[56:12] that Hallelujah I believe he's still
[56:15] with us today I I I believe he's still
[56:18] very concerned about us today very
[56:20] concerned about you children about you
[56:23] mamas and daddies he's concerned about
[56:25] us all
[56:27] amen all right let's um are we doing
[56:29] okay am I am I reading too
[56:32] fast all right amen
[56:37] um let's see
[56:42] here okay so now now notice what he says
[56:47] the devil will cast some of you into
[56:49] prison that you might may be tried the
[56:52] Jews were doing that right then the
[56:55] Pagan priests were doing that right then
[56:58] the governors who tried to Curry favor
[57:00] with the public because the people like
[57:03] the arena hurled the Christians by the
[57:05] thousands to their death destroyed them
[57:08] by lions and
[57:10] Gladiators what has the devil to do with
[57:12] this why blame him oh yes but it is the
[57:16] devil's hatred behind it all he is
[57:19] behind it all for he hates God what God
[57:23] has set his heart on Satan is bound to
[57:27] try to destroy that's a good place to
[57:30] Mark right there what God has set his
[57:34] heart
[57:35] on Satan is bound to try to destroy but
[57:40] watch here are some illumination if
[57:43] Satan is behind the Jews who are hailing
[57:45] Christians into court then the Jews are
[57:48] not of God's religion but the Devils
[57:51] their Gathering is also of the synagogue
[57:54] of Satan
[57:56] and if the Roman Catholic Church killed
[57:59] the multitudes of Believers in the Dark
[58:01] Ages yes and in all ages then they are
[58:05] of the devil and belong to Satan also
[58:09] amen and then I I if and if you think
[58:13] this shocking just wait until the
[58:15] prophecy of Revelation 13 is fulfilled
[58:18] it is strikingly true that the United
[58:21] States of America is in that chapter the
[58:24] very number 13 is a symbol of this
[58:27] nation it's started with 13 colonies
[58:30] it's 13 or its flag has 13 stars and 13
[58:35] stripes there is her Destiny in the 13th
[58:38] chapter in this
[58:40] image this is that is mentioned in this
[58:44] chapter will be found all the wickedness
[58:45] of the Beast that was before
[58:47] it as the Beast Rose and the at the Nan
[58:50] Council so the image will come out of
[58:53] the uh the World Council of churches
[58:55] with all ungodly and satanic power to
[58:59] vent the anger of the devil upon the
[59:01] True Vine of God it will it it will be a
[59:04] Repeat Performance of all diabolical
[59:07] cunning and cruelty uh cunning and
[59:09] cruelty those who fight the humble of
[59:12] God and scoff and Destroy let them do it
[59:16] and do it they will and all in the name
[59:19] of God in religion but they lie they're
[59:22] not of God they are of their father the
[59:25] devil
[59:26] they by their deeds against any people
[59:29] expose themselves for what they are let
[59:32] them organize and repudiate the little A
[59:34] Flock but but uh they but further reveal
[59:37] to all that they are of the devil they
[59:40] are of the false Vine the vine that
[59:42] murders their hatred proves who they are
[59:46] the Nick and Antichrist church is who
[59:49] they are they shall they shall be cast
[59:52] into prison yes they are held into court
[59:55] and falsely accused and tried and impr
[59:57] prison of course it is all done in the
[59:59] name of religion and decency and
[1:00:01] outraged
[1:00:03] innocency all done for a good cause that
[1:00:06] makes me think of the Supreme Courts
[1:00:09] ruling on prayer and Bible reading in
[1:00:11] the scrs who's behind it Satan is it is
[1:00:16] just another angry Outburst against God
[1:00:20] Thou shalt have tribulation for 10 days
[1:00:22] and here is a prophecy and with it is is
[1:00:26] a means of determining the lifespan of
[1:00:28] the samran church
[1:00:30] age uh Diocesan the
[1:00:36] cruestv god that except for the mercy of
[1:00:39] God would have wiped out all believers
[1:00:41] it was the bloodiest in history lasted
[1:00:44] 10 years the 10 days of Revelations uh
[1:00:48] 2:10 from 32 to
[1:00:51] 312 but be be thou faithful unto death
[1:00:55] he does not
[1:00:56] say be faithful until death but unto
[1:01:00] death you might have to seal your
[1:01:02] testimony with your blood thousands yay
[1:01:04] Millions have died during all the ages
[1:01:08] they have died in the faith like Antipas
[1:01:11] the faithful martyr they held not their
[1:01:14] lives unto death often we think that it
[1:01:17] would be most impossible it would be
[1:01:20] impossible to be a martyr but dare to
[1:01:23] recall that the faith we daily use to
[1:01:25] Triumph in Christ Christ Jesus is the
[1:01:27] same faith that upholds the polycarp and
[1:01:31] all Martyrs did you hear that the same
[1:01:35] faith that we have today is the faith
[1:01:39] the same faith that they had the Supreme
[1:01:42] now here it is I love it this is this is
[1:01:44] good might mark this down I I'd Mark
[1:01:47] what we just read there the the same uh
[1:01:51] see we but but dare to recall that the
[1:01:54] faith we daily use to tr Triumph in
[1:01:56] Christ Jesus is the same faith that
[1:01:58] upholds the polyc carps and all Martyrs
[1:02:01] the Supreme faith will give Supreme
[1:02:04] Grace for the Supreme hour blessed be
[1:02:08] God
[1:02:10] forever how is it that we
[1:02:13] stand what how is it that you're
[1:02:15] standing tonight in your trial how is it
[1:02:19] that my father can still get up there
[1:02:20] and and dare to sing like he did this
[1:02:22] last Sunday morning and while while he
[1:02:24] has served the Lord all of those
[1:02:26] millions and years don't you think the
[1:02:27] devil's not there saying you know what
[1:02:30] is this the best you can get from God in
[1:02:32] your later years you you you've given
[1:02:36] everything to you gave him your all from
[1:02:39] your very Youth and now this is what
[1:02:42] God's given you at your at your end and
[1:02:44] yet dad will still stand there and give
[1:02:46] God and say through it all I've learned
[1:02:49] to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust
[1:02:52] in God you've gone through your testings
[1:02:55] and your trials and Satan's done every
[1:02:57] which way to turn you around come on we
[1:03:01] fight we fight hard but the same faith
[1:03:05] that was in those guys back then's the
[1:03:07] same faith that you're using today
[1:03:09] that'll stand Amen in fact I would say
[1:03:13] as the prophet would say Amen this is
[1:03:16] the hardest of Ages because it's not
[1:03:19] we're fixing to read now we're I I'm uh
[1:03:21] um I'm trying amen I'm just going to
[1:03:23] read down to the rewards for overcoming
[1:03:25] which is another paragraph and then I
[1:03:27] want to read to you a little bit from
[1:03:29] the um the fox's book of Martyrs and
[1:03:31] just Lord sort of let you know what what
[1:03:33] they went through as they were there but
[1:03:35] that same faith is the faith that you're
[1:03:37] standing with here tonight amen all
[1:03:40] right let's let's let's read this last
[1:03:42] little part here I will give thee a
[1:03:43] crown of life since not even a cup of
[1:03:46] cold water given in the name of the Lord
[1:03:48] fails to receive a reward how great
[1:03:52] shall be the reward to him that gives
[1:03:54] his life as a martyr for the name of
[1:03:56] Jesus of the Lord Jesus perhaps we can
[1:03:59] get a small idea if we compare this
[1:04:02] crown with the crown one in a race 1
[1:04:04] Corinthians 9 and 24 Paul says know ye
[1:04:07] not that they which run in a race run
[1:04:10] all but one receives the prize so run
[1:04:13] that ye may obtain a crown given to the
[1:04:16] winner of the Olympic race was a Garland
[1:04:18] of olive branches but the crown spoken
[1:04:21] of here in Revelation given to a martyr
[1:04:24] is the crown of r royalty Jesus calls it
[1:04:28] the Crown of Life The One Crown is for
[1:04:31] those who have
[1:04:32] striven the other is for the ones who
[1:04:35] have given both crowns are
[1:04:38] Incorruptible they uh they will not
[1:04:40] perish the winners of the worldly race
[1:04:43] of life will soon lose the joy of the
[1:04:47] plotts of the world their Glory will
[1:04:50] fail but those who live their lives for
[1:04:52] God either by daily striving or shedding
[1:04:55] their blood blood as the crowning
[1:04:57] sacrifice of their lives will be given
[1:04:59] the Crown of Life all too little time is
[1:05:02] spent on laboring for the Eternal
[1:05:03] rewards of God I say Amen to that the
[1:05:07] recompense of God is too lightly
[1:05:10] esteemed if we believe in the reality of
[1:05:12] the resurrection of the body and an
[1:05:14] eternal Kingdom of substance then we
[1:05:17] ought to lay up our in heaven those good
[1:05:20] Treasures that are available to the
[1:05:22] faithful Saints I I think I think that
[1:05:24] paragraph right there is so important
[1:05:27] all too little time is spent on laboring
[1:05:29] for the Eternal rewards of God and the
[1:05:33] recompense of God is taken too lightly
[1:05:36] amen and so we we want to now as as the
[1:05:42] as the uh Prophet was talking how Satan
[1:05:46] was after amen that that church and and
[1:05:52] you you know um uh you know
[1:05:56] there was uh James the great according
[1:05:59] to St Matthew in the history of the
[1:06:01] Apostles acts the the acts of of the of
[1:06:04] the Holy Spirit uh James the son of
[1:06:07] jeedy the the elder brother of John
[1:06:09] relative of Our
[1:06:12] Lord um for his mother Shalom was a
[1:06:16] cousin German to the Virgin Mary he said
[1:06:20] the accounts given us by an eminent
[1:06:22] primitive writer uh Clemens Alex
[1:06:26] zrus ought not to be
[1:06:28] overlooked James was led to the place of
[1:06:31] martyrdom and his accuser was brought to
[1:06:34] repent of his conduct by the apostles
[1:06:38] extraordinary courage and
[1:06:40] undaunted and fell down at his feet to
[1:06:42] request his pardon professing himself a
[1:06:45] Christian and resolving that James
[1:06:47] should not receive the crown of
[1:06:48] martyrdom alone hence they were both
[1:06:51] beheaded at the same time thus did the
[1:06:55] first Apostolic martyr uh cheerfully and
[1:06:57] resolutely received that cup which he
[1:07:00] told our Lord our savior he was ready to
[1:07:04] drink isn't that something here's
[1:07:06] another account of Phillip I'm going to
[1:07:08] go run through these real quick this is
[1:07:10] all out of the fox's book of martys so
[1:07:12] Philip was born in Betha Betha in
[1:07:15] Galilee now these are these are Bible
[1:07:18] characters here and was first called by
[1:07:20] the name of disciple he labored
[1:07:23] diligently in Upper Asia and suffered
[1:07:25] martyrdom
[1:07:26] in in hopus in Fr
[1:07:30] frag he was scored thrown into prison
[1:07:33] and afterwards crucified in ad 54
[1:07:37] Matthew uh he was a toll gatherer was
[1:07:40] born at Nazareth and he wrote his the
[1:07:44] gospel in Hebrew which afterwards
[1:07:45] translated Greek by James the Le the
[1:07:48] scene of his labers was partha in
[1:07:51] Ethiopia in which uh latter country he
[1:07:54] suffered mared him slain with with a
[1:07:57] harbard in the city of nababa in
[1:08:02] ad60 um James the last they I mean every
[1:08:05] one of these
[1:08:07] Mattheus uh he was the one who took uh
[1:08:11] judas's place he was stoned in Jerusalem
[1:08:13] and then he was beheaded
[1:08:16] Andrew uh he was uh Andrew was the
[1:08:20] brother of Peter and he preached the
[1:08:22] gospel to
[1:08:23] many Asia to Nations and Asian Nations
[1:08:28] but on his arrival at adessa he was
[1:08:31] taken and crucified on the on a cross
[1:08:34] the two ends of which were fixed
[1:08:35] transversally in the ground and hence
[1:08:39] the uh and hence
[1:08:42] the derivation of the term uh St
[1:08:46] Andrew's cross uh it goes on down there
[1:08:49] I mean all of the apostles were martyred
[1:08:52] the only ones that was not the only one
[1:08:54] that was not martyred was
[1:08:55] was the um John who wrote uh The Book of
[1:09:01] Revelations now I want to get on into
[1:09:03] the persecution in this church age that
[1:09:06] brother uh that we just read and so um
[1:09:11] this is all around that same time it
[1:09:13] says Mark Marcus um
[1:09:17] aelius followed about the year of the
[1:09:20] Lord uh 161 I know this is a little bit
[1:09:24] ahead of uh the the Smur and church age
[1:09:26] but it's right around that same area a
[1:09:28] man of nature more Stern and severe
[1:09:31] although in the study of philosophy and
[1:09:33] in counsil government no less
[1:09:36] commendable yet towards the Christians
[1:09:38] sharp and Fierce by whom was moved the
[1:09:41] fourth persecution the cruelties used in
[1:09:44] this persecution were such that many of
[1:09:47] the spectators shuddered with horror at
[1:09:50] the sight and were astonished at the
[1:09:52] Intrepid of the sufferers some of the
[1:09:55] mar ERS were obliged to pass with their
[1:09:58] already wounded feet over thorns and
[1:10:00] Nails sharp shells Etc upon their points
[1:10:04] others were scourged until their Senus
[1:10:07] and veins lay bare after suffering the
[1:10:10] most excruciating torturers tortures
[1:10:14] that could be devised they were
[1:10:15] destroyed by the most terrible
[1:10:17] deaths uh germanicus a young man but a
[1:10:21] true Christian being delivered to the
[1:10:23] wild beast on account of of his faith
[1:10:26] behave with such astonishing courage
[1:10:28] that several pagans become converts to
[1:10:32] to a faith which inspired such
[1:10:35] fortitude uh here's an account of
[1:10:37] polycarp's martyrdom as we are writing
[1:10:39] to you this is and actually poop was
[1:10:41] martyred there in samna and so this is
[1:10:45] the brothers from the samna church he
[1:10:47] says we we are writing to you Brothers
[1:10:49] with an account of the martyrs
[1:10:51] especially the Blessed polycarp whose
[1:10:54] death brought to to the persecu uh to a
[1:10:58] close uh almost all the events that led
[1:11:01] up to it reveal it to be another
[1:11:04] martyrdom in the Divine pattern that we
[1:11:07] see in the gospel for he waited for his
[1:11:09] betrayal just like the Lord did so that
[1:11:13] we might follow him in looking after the
[1:11:15] needs of others as well as ourselves
[1:11:18] true love desires not only one's own
[1:11:21] salvation but the salvation of all our
[1:11:24] brothers all the martyrdoms which God
[1:11:26] allowed to happen remember that The
[1:11:28] Devout will ascribe all things to his
[1:11:30] sovereignty were blessed and Noble we
[1:11:33] could not admire their honor their
[1:11:35] patience their love for the Lord or who
[1:11:38] could not admire they were whipped to
[1:11:42] shreds till their veins and arteries
[1:11:44] were exposed and still endured patiently
[1:11:47] while even those that stood by cried for
[1:11:50] them they had such courage that none of
[1:11:52] them let out a sigh or a groan proving
[1:11:55] that they suffered such torments were
[1:11:57] absent from their bodies or rather the
[1:11:59] Lord then stood by them and talked with
[1:12:02] them by the grace of God they despised
[1:12:04] all the cruelties of this world
[1:12:05] redeeming themselves from Eternal
[1:12:07] punishment by the suffering of a single
[1:12:10] hour the fire of their Savage
[1:12:13] executioners appeared cool to them
[1:12:16] because they fixed their eyes on their
[1:12:18] escape from the Eternal unquenchable
[1:12:20] fire and the good things promised to
[1:12:22] those who endure things which Ear Has
[1:12:25] Not Heard nor eyes seen nor the human
[1:12:28] heart imagined but re what were revealed
[1:12:31] to them by the Lord they were no longer
[1:12:34] men they had already become angels in
[1:12:37] the same way those who were condemned to
[1:12:40] the wild beast endured Dreadful torture
[1:12:42] some were stretched out on beds of
[1:12:44] spikes others were subjected to all
[1:12:46] kinds of torments all in the devil's
[1:12:49] attempt to make them deny Christ in in
[1:12:52] all that the devil attempted he failed
[1:12:54] thank be to God the
[1:12:57] heroic uh germanicus encouraged the Weak
[1:13:01] by his own endurance and fought bravely
[1:13:04] the wild beast when the proconsul tried
[1:13:07] to persuade him to cooperate for the
[1:13:10] sake of his own youth he drew the wild
[1:13:13] beast toward himself and provoked it in
[1:13:15] order to escape more quickly from this
[1:13:18] wicked World seeing all this the am the
[1:13:21] amazed crowd of Spectators cried out
[1:13:23] down with the atheist
[1:13:25] and those who do not believe in the
[1:13:27] Roman gods go get
[1:13:29] polycarp and by the way when quentis
[1:13:32] the F fresan handed himself over for
[1:13:38] martyrdom with some others the proconsul
[1:13:40] persuaded them to take the oath and
[1:13:44] sacrifice this is why we do not approve
[1:13:47] of voluntary martyrdom something the
[1:13:50] gospel does not teach us to do so he was
[1:13:52] saying and I read I read in another
[1:13:54] account here that these that there were
[1:13:55] some men that that that were encouraged
[1:13:58] by this and and um um uh they were going
[1:14:04] to just put themselves out there to be
[1:14:06] killed so that they could be a murderer
[1:14:08] but they weren't true Christians they
[1:14:10] were among them but when they came in
[1:14:13] and when they when they got to the to to
[1:14:16] to the
[1:14:17] persecution uh they they persuaded them
[1:14:21] to take an oath and a sacrifice and the
[1:14:23] Christians looked at them with great
[1:14:25] disdain and said how could you do that
[1:14:28] and it was quite the Christians looked
[1:14:30] at these men as if they were such
[1:14:32] traitors to portray Christ not not
[1:14:35] betray them but to betray Christ and um
[1:14:40] uh there was there was amongst the the
[1:14:42] Christians it was a big big thing to see
[1:14:45] them walk away and to uh to yield to to
[1:14:51] these others that were trying to get
[1:14:53] them to turn from Christ he says and and
[1:14:56] as far as uh uh it says and when he
[1:14:59] polycarp when he heard about this the
[1:15:03] redoutable uh polycarp was not in the
[1:15:05] least upset and was happy to stay in the
[1:15:08] city but eventually he was persued to
[1:15:11] leave he went to friends in the nearby
[1:15:13] country where as usual he spent the
[1:15:16] whole time day and night in prayer for
[1:15:18] all the people and for the churches
[1:15:20] throughout the world 3 days before his
[1:15:23] he was arrested while he was praying he
[1:15:25] had a vision of his pillow under his
[1:15:28] head in Flames he said prophetically to
[1:15:31] those who were with him I will be burnt
[1:15:34] alive those who were looking for him uh
[1:15:37] were coming near so he left for another
[1:15:39] house and they immediately followed him
[1:15:42] and when they could not find him They
[1:15:44] seized two young men from his own
[1:15:46] household and tortured them into
[1:15:49] confession and uh uh the the governor uh
[1:15:54] was was impatient to bring polycarp to
[1:15:56] the stadium so that he might fulfill his
[1:15:59] special role to share the sufferings of
[1:16:02] Christ while those who betrayed him
[1:16:04] would be punished like Judas the police
[1:16:09] and the horsemen uh came with the young
[1:16:12] men at supper time on on the Friday uh
[1:16:16] with their usual weapons as as if coming
[1:16:20] against a robber now some of these words
[1:16:22] police uh Sheriff some of those say
[1:16:24] things have been changed to fix to to to
[1:16:27] to match our modern language okay so it
[1:16:29] wasn't that there were Poli in those
[1:16:31] days it uh they they have they have
[1:16:34] taken the fox this the fox's book of
[1:16:37] Martyrs and has and have just sort of
[1:16:39] put into modern terms so that we could
[1:16:42] understand it and so uh but they did not
[1:16:45] they did not take in any of the
[1:16:47] Integrity away from it he says um the
[1:16:49] police and the horsemen came with the
[1:16:51] with with the young men young man at
[1:16:53] supper time on body with their usual
[1:16:56] weapons as if they were coming out
[1:16:58] against a robber that evening they found
[1:17:01] him lying in the upper room of a cottage
[1:17:04] he could have escaped but he refused
[1:17:05] saying God's will be done when he heard
[1:17:08] that they had come he went down and
[1:17:10] spoke with them they were amazed at his
[1:17:13] age and steadfastness and some of them
[1:17:14] said why did we go to so much trouble to
[1:17:18] capture a man like this immediately he
[1:17:20] called for food and for drink for them
[1:17:24] and asked for an hour to pray un
[1:17:26] interrupted so he's going to feed his
[1:17:28] enemies he says they agreed and he stood
[1:17:31] and prayed for uh so full of the grace
[1:17:34] of God that he could not stop for two
[1:17:37] hours men the men were astounded and
[1:17:40] many of them regretted coming to arrest
[1:17:42] such a Godly and venerable old man when
[1:17:46] he was finished praying they put him on
[1:17:48] a donkey and took him into the city as
[1:17:50] polycarp was was being taken into the
[1:17:53] arena of a voice came to him from Heaven
[1:17:57] be strong polycarp and play the man no
[1:18:00] one
[1:18:02] saw no one saw who had spoken but our
[1:18:04] brothers who were there heard the voice
[1:18:07] and when the crowd heard that polycarp
[1:18:09] had been captured there was an uproar
[1:18:12] the proconsul asked him whether he was
[1:18:15] polycarp and on hearing that he was uh
[1:18:18] that he was he he tried to persuade him
[1:18:21] to a apostasy saying have respect to
[1:18:24] your old age swear by the fortune of
[1:18:27] Caesar repent and say down with the
[1:18:29] atheist and polycarp looked grimly at
[1:18:32] the wicked Heathen multitude in the
[1:18:34] stadium and gesturing towards them
[1:18:36] saying down with the atheist swear urged
[1:18:39] the proconsul reproach Christ and I will
[1:18:42] set you free 86 years have I served him
[1:18:45] polyc clarp declared he has done me no
[1:18:48] wrong how can I blaspheme My Savior and
[1:18:51] my king I have wild animals here the
[1:18:55] proconsul said I will throw you to them
[1:18:58] if you do not repent repent call them
[1:19:01] polycarp replied it is Unthinkable for
[1:19:04] me to repent from what is good to turn
[1:19:07] to what is evil I will be glad though be
[1:19:10] uh though to be charged from Evil to
[1:19:13] righteousness if you despise the animals
[1:19:15] I will have you burned you threaten me
[1:19:18] with fire with which burns for an hour
[1:19:21] and is then extinguished but you know
[1:19:23] nothing of the fire of the coming
[1:19:25] judgment and eternal punishment reserved
[1:19:27] for the ungodly why are you waiting
[1:19:30] bring on whatever you want and it was
[1:19:33] all done in the time that it takes to
[1:19:36] tell the crowd collected wood and
[1:19:38] bundles of sticks and the shops and uh
[1:19:41] from the shops and the public baths the
[1:19:43] Jews as usual Were King to help when the
[1:19:46] pile was ready polycarp took off his
[1:19:49] outer clothes and undid his belt and
[1:19:51] tried to take off a sandal something he
[1:19:54] was not used to as the faithful always
[1:19:56] raced to do it for him each wanting to
[1:20:00] be the one to touch his skin this is how
[1:20:02] good his life was but when they went to
[1:20:05] fix him with nails he said leave me as I
[1:20:08] am for he that giveth me strength to
[1:20:11] endure the fire will enable me not to
[1:20:14] struggle without the help of your
[1:20:16] nails so they simply bound him with his
[1:20:19] hands behind him with a distinguished
[1:20:21] Ram chose uh like a distinguished Ram
[1:20:24] chosen
[1:20:25] with a great from a great flock of
[1:20:28] sacrifice ready to be acceptable uh
[1:20:30] acceptable burnt offering to God he
[1:20:33] looked up to heaven and said oh Lord God
[1:20:36] Almighty the father of your beloved and
[1:20:38] blessed Jesus Christ by whom we have
[1:20:41] received the knowledge of you the God of
[1:20:43] angels powers and every
[1:20:45] creature and of all the righteous who
[1:20:48] live before you I give you thanks that
[1:20:51] you count me worthy to be numbered among
[1:20:53] your martyrs sharing the cup of Christ
[1:20:55] the resurrection and the resurrection to
[1:20:58] eternal life both of soul and body
[1:21:01] through the immortality of the Holy
[1:21:03] Spirit may I be received this day as an
[1:21:07] acceptable sacrifice as you the true God
[1:21:10] have predestined and revealed to me and
[1:21:13] now fulfilled I praise you for all these
[1:21:16] things I bless you and glorify you along
[1:21:21] with the Everlasting Jesus Christ your
[1:21:23] beloved Son to you with him through the
[1:21:25] Holy Ghost be glory uh both now and
[1:21:29] forever amen then the fire was lit and
[1:21:33] the fire and the flame blazed furiously
[1:21:36] we who were privileged to witness it saw
[1:21:39] a great miracle this is why we had been
[1:21:43] preserved to tell the story The Fire
[1:21:45] shaped itself like into the form of an
[1:21:47] arch like the sail of a ship when filled
[1:21:50] with the wind and formed a circle around
[1:21:53] the body of the Martyr inside it looked
[1:21:56] like not it looked not like flesh that
[1:21:58] is burnt but like bread that is baked or
[1:22:01] gold and silver glowing in the fire we
[1:22:04] smelled a sweet scent like fragrance or
[1:22:07] some other sweet precious other precious
[1:22:11] spices eventually when those wicked men
[1:22:13] saw that his body could not be consumed
[1:22:15] by the fire they commanded an
[1:22:17] executioner to pierce him with a
[1:22:20] dagger and when he did this a dove flew
[1:22:23] out
[1:22:25] uh and such a great quantity of blood
[1:22:28] flowed that fire that the fire was
[1:22:32] extinguished the crowd were amazed at
[1:22:35] the difference between the unbelievers
[1:22:36] and the elect of whom the great polycarp
[1:22:39] was surely one having in our own times
[1:22:42] been an Apostolic and prophetic teacher
[1:22:44] the bishop of The Universal Church in
[1:22:47] Samina for for every word he uh spoke
[1:22:52] either has been uh either has been or
[1:22:56] shall be accomplished when the enemy saw
[1:22:58] The Wonder of his monorom his blameless
[1:23:01] life and now crowning with immortality
[1:23:03] he did his utmost to stop us keeping any
[1:23:06] Memorial of him or taking possession of
[1:23:08] his holy body he inspired Nikas nikitas
[1:23:13] the father of Herod along with the Jews
[1:23:15] to ask the governor not to hand over his
[1:23:18] body for
[1:23:20] burial uh they might turn from
[1:23:22] worshiping the crucified one only to
[1:23:24] start worshiping this one they did not
[1:23:26] realize that it was impossible for us to
[1:23:28] abandon Christ who suffered for the
[1:23:30] Salvation of the world were to worship
[1:23:33] any other amen wasn't that quite a
[1:23:36] reading sir
[1:23:39] amen praise the Lord I'm want to give
[1:23:41] you a few other examples here I want to
[1:23:43] bring polycarp in is right in the middle
[1:23:45] right in there with that it says
[1:23:47] metrodorus a minister who preached

[1:26:27] you guys um but here's here's a few
[1:26:32] inscriptions that they found um you know
[1:26:37] despite the awful story of persecution
[1:26:39] that we read here the inscriptions bre
[1:26:43] breathe forth peace and joy and Triumph
[1:26:46] and here are a few and so they're just
[1:26:48] given us a few things in scriptions that

[1:27:03] his sweetest son born away of angels
[1:27:06] victorious in peace and in Christ being
[1:27:09] called away he went in
[1:27:11] peace uh remember when reading these
[1:27:13] inscriptions the story of skeletons tell
[1:27:15] the persecution and torture of fire but
[1:27:18] the full force of these uh is seen when
[1:27:22] we contrast them with the Pagan
[1:27:26] uh the Pagan things it's live for the
[1:27:29] present hour since we are sure of
[1:27:31] nothing else I lift my hands unto the
[1:27:33] gods who took me away at the age of 20
[1:27:36] though I had done no harm once I was not
[1:27:40] now I am not I know nothing about it it
[1:27:44] is no concern of mine traveler curse me
[1:27:47] not as you pass for I'm in darkness and
[1:27:49] cannot
[1:27:50] answer the most frequent Christian
[1:27:53] symbols on the walls of the Catacombs
[1:27:55] are the Good Shepherd with the Lamb on
[1:27:57] his shoulder a ship under Full Sail
[1:28:00] Harps anchors crowns Vines and above all
[1:28:05] the fish amen isn't that something yes
[1:28:07] sir amen so you know I I I thought I
[1:28:12] would go ahead and and and bring this
[1:28:15] bring some of this in and um and share
[1:28:17] it with you guys tonight did y'all enjoy
[1:28:19] the little bit of reading we had there
[1:28:21] from polycarp and the church
[1:28:27] ages and uh there's there's there's a
[1:28:30] lot really a lot of of other really
[1:28:33] incredible things that you could read at
[1:28:35] home in the church age uh or in the um
[1:28:39] in in the uh Fox book of Martyrs I
[1:28:43] thought this was particular interesting
[1:28:45] because this is that that that suan age
[1:28:49] and and it was brother Brandon would
[1:28:51] would bring it in um and there's even uh
[1:28:55] even the one that that the cruelest of
[1:28:58] all the Emperors I think there was a
[1:29:00] total of of what they called U uh 10 uh
[1:29:04] persecutions what they would call
[1:29:05] persecutions were the seasons that they
[1:29:08] went through those dark ages and just
[1:29:09] and just really hammered these um and
[1:29:13] and and slaughtered the Christians and
[1:29:16] so um I just thought that that would be
[1:29:18] good to bring in tonight amen so um are
[1:29:22] there any questions or any comments here
[1:29:24] this
[1:29:25] evening
[1:29:29] amen praise the
[1:29:32] Lord anything that y'all want to add uh
[1:29:36] to
[1:29:37] this amen hopefully it wasn't too much
[1:29:39] reading tonight praise the Lord um okay
[1:29:44] so um uh
[1:29:47] sister
[1:29:49] uh um let's see did I bring my phone
[1:29:53] Josh would you get my phone phone there
[1:29:54] on on the desk
[1:29:59] um the question that
[1:30:02] sister
[1:30:04] um U oh Brianna Brianna brought to us
[1:30:10] the night uh was actually some quotes
[1:30:12] and so she she she uh she sent these to
[1:30:16] me and so um I thought that I would
[1:30:21] just read them to you
[1:30:24] quickly and
[1:30:30] um praise the
[1:30:34] Lord
[1:30:43] amen okay so
[1:30:47] um in just a minute well it's not going
[1:30:50] to bring it up
[1:30:56] okay so she had asked about the uh
[1:30:58] Abel's children and uh and uh Seth's
[1:31:04] children and so uh and I and so it it
[1:31:09] and it read something like this well
[1:31:11] Abel's children were humble Farmers
[1:31:14] Shepherds pastors you know Shepherds
[1:31:17] Farmers humble didn't claim to be smart
[1:31:20] but they just they just with the word
[1:31:24] what did they produced at the end time a
[1:31:26] prophet it did a prophet what for the
[1:31:29] last times when Noah stood in at the
[1:31:32] door uh building on that Ark he said
[1:31:35] it's coming a rain he was called a
[1:31:37] fanatic but he was a
[1:31:39] prophet another one was the humble
[1:31:42] little race produced a prophet and that
[1:31:46] prophet in the days of Abel's children
[1:31:49] produced a prophet that showed the Last
[1:31:51] Day signs and give the warning
[1:31:54] and so um so that's where sister Brianna
[1:31:58] was coming the other night about the
[1:32:00] difference you know uh that with the
[1:32:02] spiritual lineage come from Abel's
[1:32:04] children or from Seth and um and so uh
[1:32:09] uh but here's here's the deal I I think
[1:32:13] I I um from from everything that the
[1:32:16] scripture says the scripture had said
[1:32:19] that the um that after Seth was born
[1:32:24] then man began to call upon the name of
[1:32:26] the Lord and so when you look at that
[1:32:29] and then look at all of the other quotes
[1:32:32] where brother brandham when he would
[1:32:34] compare the spiritual lineage uh with
[1:32:38] the Serpent's lineage he would always
[1:32:39] use that of Seth lineage and not of Abel
[1:32:44] so I think that that was that was um uh
[1:32:48] just just misspeaking when when he had
[1:32:51] mentioned that because we have dozens of
[1:32:53] of quotes where we where we're talking
[1:32:55] about Seth so in my opinion it's it's
[1:32:58] like it's like um uh him saying 700
[1:33:02] prophets instead of 7,000 prophets and
[1:33:04] he said it several times and this was
[1:33:06] this was said the same uh in the same
[1:33:09] tape so he said 700 uh uh that had not
[1:33:14] bowed you know to Baal or kissed his
[1:33:16] lips and he said that a couple of times
[1:33:19] in that in that sermon but but we know
[1:33:22] when he came back later and said oh no
[1:33:24] no they they thought there was something
[1:33:25] spiritual being stated there and he goes
[1:33:28] oh no I just misspoke that um it was
[1:33:31] really 7,000 and so I think that that's
[1:33:34] the same this is the same here is is
[1:33:38] that it's because the um there there is
[1:33:43] there is not brother brandham never says
[1:33:45] anything else about it about Abel having
[1:33:47] children uh about abble having uh a wife
[1:33:51] but it does say something about Seth
[1:33:55] children then men began to call upon the
[1:33:57] name of the Lord so whether or not that
[1:34:00] that is what brother bradam meant I
[1:34:03] can't tell you that um but I do know
[1:34:06] that that is um when they when he talked
[1:34:09] about Abel um and then going straight
[1:34:12] into Noah it was Abel's children that
[1:34:16] brought on Noah well that was Seth's
[1:34:18] children that actually brought in Noah
[1:34:21] so um so that that's that that's that's
[1:34:25] where she was at so I I uh so those of
[1:34:27] us that were looking at sister Brianna
[1:34:29] the other night and just wondering now
[1:34:30] where would you get Abel's children well
[1:34:31] that was actually a quote
[1:34:33] so so we appreciate uh Brianna bringing
[1:34:37] that in to us just in case anybody
[1:34:39] wanted to know that looks like they've
[1:34:41] already stepped out but um all right so
[1:34:45] is there uh anything else anyone want to
[1:34:47] say yes
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:11] yeah
[1:35:13] yeah yeah yeah do you have that won't
[1:35:16] you read
[1:35:19] thats her priest viated law and
[1:35:32] andle their from my sabbaths and I am
[1:35:36] profane among them amen well that's that
[1:35:39] that's where that's where the synagogue
[1:35:41] of Satan had been that's where they had
[1:35:42] reached got to that point where they had
[1:35:44] taken it all in and and uh and brother
[1:35:48] that that's where we are at today until
[1:35:52] until the gospel of Christ means nothing
[1:35:55] like it was in that early church amen
[1:35:59] praise the Lord all right any anything
[1:36:02] else anyone wants to add real
