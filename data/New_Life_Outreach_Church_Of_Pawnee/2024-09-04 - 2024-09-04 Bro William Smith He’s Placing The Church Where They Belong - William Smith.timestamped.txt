[10:06] way like he
[10:09] did blind
[10:12] bmus and zachus you might be real you
[10:15] might be the shortest man in town amen
[10:19] sometimes I thought about that growing
[10:21] up that uh Simi I was pretty small
[10:24] myself you know I had to share my height
[10:27] with my twin brother so there was two of
[10:30] us so that's just a joke but uh my my
[10:34] older brother was a lot taller than I
[10:36] was man how did he get so tall you know
[10:40] and I'm uh I'm uh seem to be so short
[10:45] but it don't matter amen even if you got
[10:47] to climb a tree amen as the Lord comes
[10:51] by so he'll see you amen you believe
[10:54] simy that he he he'll pass by your way
[10:56] how about all you young people you
[10:58] believe he will pass by your way that
[11:01] this just not just another little
[11:03] service that even though we he's not in
[11:06] in in a physical body like we are
[11:08] brother Bram said he's here in every way
[11:10] except his Corporal body amen that he's
[11:13] he can do
[11:14] exactly what he did when he was here in
[11:18] flesh he can do that tonight like he did
[11:21] 2,000 years ago amen if we are under
[11:24] that expectation amen I believe we can
[11:27] have what we have need tonight
[11:30] amen and he can do above even this above
[11:33] all that we can even ask or think amen
[11:37] what a promise that is tonight but amen
[11:41] my pastor's gone but Jesus is here ain't
[11:44] that right sister April amen he left us
[11:48] amen not that he's not Dependable he's
[11:51] very dependable but he's in Claremore
[11:54] Oklahoma tonight amen he went to uh is
[11:57] going to be preaching there for brother
[11:59] Bryce Collins and uh there's going to be
[12:01] a baptism service for some uh I believe

[12:06] right brother Austin that were here how
[12:08] many of them is getting baptized two of
[12:11] them's getting sisters both are they
[12:13] both sisters amen so uh I think that's
[12:17] where Jonah's at I think I think I put
[12:21] two and two together there I think he
[12:24] went to the baptism tonight so that's
[12:26] why he's not on the bass guitar but
[12:28] let's remember our pastor amen and those
[12:32] those uh teenage girls that are being
[12:35] baptized I was baptized in the name of
[12:38] the Lord Jesus
[12:40] Christ at 17 years old amen I got
[12:45] baptized in the name of Father Son and
[12:47] Holy Ghost at 13 in a Baptist Church but
[12:50] uh I didn't know better brother Ken amen
[12:54] so I got re-baptized at
[12:57] 17 amen it was was just a blessing and

[39:28] Dale for a few days uh we had the
[39:31] opportunity to go
[39:34] there before I moved here I was in
[39:38] brother Manuel's church and they there
[39:42] in Pint top lost their
[39:45] pastor and so for 11 years theyve hasn't
[39:48] they haven't had a pastor and I've
[39:51] always thought you know if if they would
[39:53] ask me as I was there with brother
[39:55] Emanuel if they wanted me to come I'd
[39:56] preach for for them but it never
[39:58] happened but for 11 years I've been
[40:01] praying for them and a lot of times when
[40:04] brother wendle would go see his mom and
[40:05] dad he would come back and he would
[40:07] mention them and and we'd be praying for
[40:10] them well when I was there and I
[40:13] ministered and that evening after we
[40:16] ministered we were sitting there talking
[40:18] and fellowshipping and and uh just
[40:21] listening to their heart I just thought
[40:24] oh my Lord give them a p Pastor whatever
[40:29] they can whatever I can do to help them
[40:31] let them get them a pastor when I left
[40:34] that place that night I felt like I lost
[40:37] I was leaving my
[40:39] children I come back here and I was just
[40:42] in lots of Torment a lot of pain and for
[40:45] them I prayed constantly you Brianna and
[40:48] Robert and Sharon would tell you that
[40:51] every time i' pray for for food I prayed
[40:53] for them I I would get up in the middle
[40:56] of the night at 2:00 and and labor and
[40:58] and cry and pray for them and asking God
[41:02] to send them a
[41:04] pastor well it got to a place where it
[41:07] got really bothering me really bad and
[41:10] Sharon was kind of
[41:12] scared so she told me I needed to go
[41:14] talk to brother Wendell or talk to
[41:15] somebody that I can trust to talk to so
[41:18] I called brother Wendell up and we had
[41:21] us a little
[41:23] meeting a year before that the Lord
[41:27] spoke to my heart in
[41:30] May um in Maine we were sitting on the
[41:34] side of the ocean and I was by some
[41:37] rocks and and uh we were looking
[41:40] for uh uh seag glass and and things and
[41:46] the Lord spoke to my heart and
[41:49] says I've got a work for you to do get
[41:52] yourself
[41:54] ready and
[41:56] I I I have been battling before
[42:00] then out of
[42:02] myself that because I tried to go start
[42:05] a church one time and it
[42:07] failed that I had complex against myself
[42:11] of the call that I
[42:12] had but through brother Wendell's
[42:15] preaching and his his counseling and and
[42:18] watching him and and things like that
[42:20] and the Lord speaking through the
[42:22] prophet of God I realized I needed to
[42:26] get my b lip away from my top of my lip
[42:29] and start forgiving
[42:32] myself and so the Lord spoke to my heart
[42:36] and I came home and I told my kids and
[42:38] my wife that I don't know what's going
[42:41] to happen but in a year or so God's
[42:44] going to put me as a as a pastor he's
[42:46] going to put me as a as a uh assistant
[42:49] pastor somewhere and that was all of it
[42:53] we never talked very much about it
[42:55] again one one year
[42:59] later the Lord put this little church on
[43:03] my
[43:04] heart when I went back the very SEC the
[43:07] second time it was to try to help them I
[43:09] had a list of ministers to give them to
[43:13] help
[43:14] them and the
[43:17] Lord did something the
[43:21] opposite those wonderful people fell in
[43:24] love with me and my wife
[43:28] I never entertained it the only thing I
[43:31] did was I went and I
[43:33] preached preached Evangelistic messages
[43:36] just encouraging them and the Lord was
[43:40] showing them that I was the one that
[43:44] they've been praying for for 11
[43:46] years the
[43:48] exact paper that they were writing what
[43:51] they was asking every one of them asked
[43:53] each other what they were looking for
[43:56] was exactly
[43:59] me I didn't think that they were going
[44:01] to vote me in this
[44:03] soon I thought it was going to be
[44:05] sometime in the winter time but the lord
[44:10] gave us the opportunity to be able to
[44:12] stay in Albuquerque and work and go over
[44:15] there on the
[44:16] weekends so if there's any here that
[44:18] feel that maybe this went too fast and I
[44:22] didn't have a a time of three-month
[44:26] trial
[44:27] well if you add all the time I was there
[44:29] it was exactly three
[44:32] months and I just ministered and
[44:34] ministered and and uh they came to me
[44:38] and asked me if I would be their pastor
[44:41] and I felt like around the time of my
[44:45] birthday the Lord did put it on my heart
[44:47] but I kept it quiet just in
[44:51] prayer and uh when the kids came out in
[44:55] July the 4th
[44:57] uh they came to me and asked me if uh I
[45:01] would be their
[45:02] pastor and so we came back home and it
[45:05] ended up just being here a couple weeks
[45:07] and I went back out there for a month
[45:09] and so many
[45:12] days I really appreciate each and every
[45:14] one of your prayers they mean a lot to
[45:19] me I know brother wle didn't mention it
[45:21] across the
[45:23] pulpit but I understand
[45:27] me and him became
[45:28] buddies we've had a lot of fight not
[45:32] physical fight but battles with each
[45:34] other because we're the same
[45:37] age but God has given me a buddy and I
[45:41] believe I'm his
[45:43] buddy and so
[45:46] he's a pastor that I'll always look up
[45:49] to a man that that I feel that is is uh
[45:54] the pastor to my my
[45:57] belief of pony
[46:01] Oklahoma and
[46:03] uh those that
[46:05] I do talk to they kind of knew the
[46:09] situation but all the other ones that
[46:11] kind of was in the limbo please forgive
[46:13] me for not saying anything but I felt
[46:17] like it would be brother Wendell's job
[46:20] to do and I felt like he was hurting on
[46:23] the inside because if any of us leave
[46:27] it's going to hurt him because he loves
[46:29] us and so I really felt like this
[46:33] evening to let you all know that I
[46:36] wasn't rushing into
[46:38] nothing uh I'm scared to death this last
[46:42] four weeks I have been preaching as a
[46:44] pastor preaching a lot of
[46:47] teaching and we have seen lots of
[46:52] Miracles there's young people that are
[46:55] in their 20s that want to come to church
[46:57] and some of them are already are coming
[46:59] to
[47:00] church family members that are believe
[47:03] the return Ministry are was coming I
[47:06] made it very known that I don't believe
[47:08] in the return Ministry but God gave me
[47:10] an anointing me and I ministered to them
[47:14] and they are looking a little different
[47:18] today and brother Dale called me and
[47:22] told me
[47:24] that there is people just talking like
[47:26] might crazy there's people in his church
[47:30] that are related to people in our church
[47:32] my the church that I go to there and
[47:35] they are uh excited they see God just
[47:38] doing supernaturally in a lot of their
[47:41] own family members they're saying this
[47:44] man is not like the rest of them other
[47:46] preachers well I don't want to be like
[47:48] any other preacher I just want to be
[47:49] brother William I love young people I
[47:53] believe some of these younger people
[47:56] that are starting to be adults can tell
[47:59] you nobody else would go play football
[48:01] with them me and brother ml was out
[48:03] there playing football with them and uh
[48:06] brother Merl and I was playing against
[48:08] each other because he was a quarterback
[48:09] and I was a quarterback but you know and
[48:11] he beat me but that's all right we still
[48:12] played with the young
[48:15] people and they mean a lot to
[48:18] me and that little group means just as
[48:21] much as you
[48:22] do yes Sharon and I are going to be
[48:27] yes Brianna and Robert Is Here this is
[48:30] where the Lord has got them to be and so
[48:33] you got one ticket that we will be

[48:39] see at least a couple times a year Mama
[48:41] might be more but I want to see you all
[48:44] too and
[48:46] so uh I know some of you in here

[49:16] wife and you can ask the church there my
[49:19] hands were off of this I wouldn't tell
[49:22] them anything I just encouraged they're
[49:26] the one that
[49:28] chose and so I ask you
[49:31] please if you love me pray for me this
[49:36] is a New
[49:37] Journey and I've got a burden for them
[49:41] I've got a burden for those young men
[49:43] that that are wanting to serve the
[49:47] Lord I got men and women that are 80
[49:50] years old that thinks the world of me
[49:52] and I've only known him for five
[49:55] months and so please keep me in your
[49:59] prayers I love you
[50:02] church but this Mo this morning I got up
[50:06] and I've been studying on a thought and
[50:09] the Lord kind of changed my heart and if
[50:11] we can stand for a moment and open our
[50:16] Bibles to Galatians
[50:24] 4 I was going to say this as your
[50:26] looking at
[50:28] that took 5
[50:32] months but it took
[50:36] almost 34 years to get me ready for what
[50:39] I'm going about to
[50:41] do I had to come here to be under a
[50:46] man that was going to get into my face a
[50:50] man that would cry with me a man that
[50:52] would jump down my
[50:54] throat a man that was my my
[50:57] age to be able to to
[51:01] minister not only the word of God but
[51:06] minister of the same gift that I knew I
[51:09] had since I was 26 years
[51:11] old knowing that I didn't have the
[51:13] education and and things like that so I
[51:16] knew I was going to have to really trust
[51:18] God but God gave
[51:21] me wend
[51:25] Martin to pluck a lot of things out of
[51:29] me and he put a lot of good things in me
[51:32] I've seen a lot of stumbling blocks that
[51:35] was going to help me down the
[51:38] road one thing he taught me was when you
[51:41] make a mistake to make sure you for ask
[51:44] people
[51:45] forgiveness and that's one thing about I
[51:47] love brother wendle so much is when he
[51:50] does make mistakes he does
[51:53] apologize and I believe he means it and
[51:56] so an encouragement to all of you yeah
[52:00] you're not going
[52:02] to he's going to say certain things and
[52:05] it's going to rip you apart but if you
[52:08] have respect for that office God will
[52:10] bless you when you
[52:13] stop having respect for that
[52:16] office shame on you shame on you you
[52:21] need to get back to the Altar and cry
[52:22] out to God because brother Brandon made
[52:25] it clear
[52:27] respect the
[52:28] office but I believe with all my heart
[52:32] if you can really see it that man loves
[52:36] you CU I know he loves
[52:39] me and I thankful for him being my
[52:42] friend but here in Galatians 4 we're
[52:45] going to start the first verse first
[52:48] verse now I say and I want you to listen
[52:50] to this very
[52:52] carefully
[52:54] because I want to talk talk about you
[52:57] this
[52:57] evening now I say
[53:01] that he says I say that their heirs as
[53:04] long as he is a child different nothing
[53:08] from a servant though he be Lord of all
[53:12] so who are you today you're Lord of all
[53:16] you have been inherited to be Sons and
[53:20] Daughters of God
[53:23] today you might be a servant when you
[53:26] first come to God you might be you don't
[53:29] really know what's going on but let me
[53:31] tell you something before the
[53:33] foundations of the world you were Sons
[53:35] and Daughters of God but in but is under
[53:39] tutor and government until the time
[53:43] appointed of the father even so we when
[53:47] we were children we were bound under the
[53:51] elements of the world but when the
[53:54] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[53:58] his son made of a woman made under the
[54:02] law to redeem them that were under the
[54:06] law that we might receive the adoptions
[54:09] of sons and because ye are Sons God ha
[54:14] sent forth the spirit of his son unto
[54:18] our hearts crying Abba the
[54:23] father wherefore Thou Are are no more a
[54:27] servant but
[54:29] son and if son then an heir of God's
[54:34] through Christ you may be
[54:41] seated that there you here you
[54:44] are when you were born upon this Earth
[54:47] today whenever the time was in God's
[54:52] mind you are already one of his children
[54:56] you were born speaking lies you were
[54:58] born to lie you were born to cheat you
[55:02] were born to cuss you was born to do
[55:04] everything the opposite of what God
[55:07] wanted you actually to
[55:10] be but because of the Fall something had
[55:14] to be redeemed and because of what
[55:17] brother wendle was preaching on on
[55:19] Sunday with Ruth I mean not yeah Ruth
[55:23] there was something about her that was
[55:25] special because she was a child of God
[55:28] why she was in that Kingdom why she was
[55:32] doing the things of the world God still
[55:35] was looking for
[55:36] her somebody had to go and get her
[55:40] somebody had to get her into a place
[55:43] where she's in her place and so tonight
[55:46] I would like to speak a little while on
[55:48] his he's placing the church where they
[55:52] belong do you know where you belong this
[55:54] evening church I want know where do you
[55:57] belong in this world today because
[55:59] people are going to make fun of you
[56:01] people are going to look at you funny
[56:03] because you say that you're a Christian
[56:05] you say that you got thus sayith the
[56:07] Lord you say that you got it but the
[56:10] atistics say that the religious world is
[56:14] the most made fun of in the whole
[56:17] country is because they have so many
[56:21] Hypocrites that's out
[56:24] there everybody said says that they're
[56:26] Christians everyone says that they got
[56:29] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[56:30] Ghost every single one of them feels his
[56:33] presence coming
[56:37] down but God is
[56:40] placing his church where they
[56:45] belong I looked up the word adoption in
[56:48] the dictionary and this was out this was
[56:50] absolutely awesome your adoption into
[56:54] God's family was given you the privilege
[56:57] to live as a joint Heir with Christ in
[57:01] the inheritance of the father's
[57:04] house though you're
[57:06] United with Christ you can claim with a
[57:10] confidence in your inheritance as
[57:15] child the rights to God's promise and
[57:20] resources
[57:22] resources every promise in the book is
[57:24] yours all right every resource that you
[57:27] need to fight the devil is in the word
[57:30] of
[57:31] God but you've got to realize who you
[57:34] are these young ones need to learn who
[57:37] they are today and it's going to take
[57:39] you m and daddies to stand up as real
[57:42] Christians and live a real life of God
[57:45] in front of your children you can live
[57:47] really good sitting right here but what
[57:49] are you at at home are you really
[57:52] serving God at home or are you and your
[57:54] wife bitter and back and fighting and
[57:56] constantly fighting around their
[57:57] children and you're causing your
[57:59] children to get to an uproar or do you
[58:02] have a peace as brother wle says do you
[58:05] have
[58:08] rest but there has to be something in
[58:12] you to know what God is going to do for
[58:18] you he says
[58:20] here then did you notice
[58:23] Moses that great Mir Miracle performer
[58:27] that brought down Israel down through
[58:30] the land and brought them up to a
[58:34] Promised
[58:35] Land but did not Place their inherit to
[58:39] them he did not give them their
[58:42] inheritance he led them up to the land
[58:46] but Joshua divided the land to the
[58:49] people isn't that right and the Christ
[58:53] brought the church up to the place
[58:56] to where now listen to this he said
[58:59] Christ brought the church up to the
[59:01] place to where their possession was made
[59:05] to them was given to them just the
[59:09] Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is
[59:14] the one who set the church in
[59:18] order
[59:21] Christ he died for you and me we saw him
[59:26] Miracles after miracles in his life as
[59:28] he was
[59:30] walking upon this Earth you saw him
[59:33] raise the dead you saw him be able to
[59:36] stand there in front of those men that
[59:38] were Scholars and speak to them and made
[59:42] them have to
[59:44] hush made them mad because this man had
[59:49] the Bible not only in a form but it was
[59:51] in him because he's the one that created
[59:55] those those
[59:57] things he knew who he was he knew that
[1:00:02] when he came down to that water and he
[1:00:04] came up out of that water the Holy
[1:00:06] Spirit was leading him just like it
[1:00:09] leads you and I today when he was a
[1:00:12] young boy he was able to speak to the
[1:00:15] Pharisees and they were wow they were
[1:00:17] shocked but you don't see him having no
[1:00:20] Miracles you didn't never see him having
[1:00:22] anybody
[1:00:24] healed until the the Holy Spirit came
[1:00:26] down upon him and when he came down that
[1:00:30] God placed him in his position right
[1:00:34] then and that made him
[1:00:37] power he was able to stand there when
[1:00:40] the devil was tempting
[1:00:43] him and only use the word
[1:00:46] defend defeat
[1:00:51] him but he had one thing he said right
[1:00:54] before he was gone
[1:00:58] he said Greater Works you will do than
[1:01:01] what I have
[1:01:03] done so where are those Greater
[1:01:06] Works well we're waiting for our we're
[1:01:08] waiting for our body change
[1:01:15] what let me tell you something
[1:01:18] Church there's people out there believe
[1:01:21] that brother bradam has to come back to
[1:01:23] get us in our place
[1:01:29] there's no scripture on
[1:01:32] that I don't understand when he said
[1:01:35] I'll ride this road
[1:01:38] again but I do know this that there is
[1:01:41] two prophets is coming because it's in
[1:01:44] the Bible and they're going to come to
[1:01:46] those Jews and they're going to preach
[1:01:48] the gospel to them and that 144,000 Jews
[1:01:52] is going to accept Jesus Christ as their
[1:01:54] personal savior
[1:01:56] all
[1:01:58] right but the prophet that we believe
[1:02:01] has fulfilled Malachi
[1:02:04] 4 he's preached it and he's preached it
[1:02:08] and he's lived
[1:02:11] it but
[1:02:13] today the prophet's off the scene but
[1:02:16] there's tapes of the word of God and now
[1:02:20] it's up to you and
[1:02:22] me little
[1:02:24] bride it's up to you you to know who you
[1:02:27] are he knew who he
[1:02:29] was John the Baptist knew who he
[1:02:33] was Moses knew who he was Joshua knew
[1:02:38] who he
[1:02:40] was but who do you
[1:02:42] say
[1:02:46] huh what do you think just because
[1:02:50] you're setting in these pews doesn't
[1:02:51] mean that you're bride
[1:02:54] material but but if you are the
[1:02:58] bride you're going to die out to
[1:03:00] yourself in the way you think and you're
[1:03:03] going to act like Christians because the
[1:03:06] word's going to give you the power to be
[1:03:09] Christians he's the one that's going to
[1:03:11] give you the grace to be a
[1:03:15] Christian he's going to place you every
[1:03:19] Church age he placed those in each
[1:03:22] Church
[1:03:24] ages for their day
[1:03:26] but this last day we have to come back
[1:03:30] to
[1:03:31] Pentecost Pentecost had never left but
[1:03:35] the people left
[1:03:36] it that's why he's out there knocking on
[1:03:39] the door today if anybody would open the
[1:03:41] door he'd come and sck with him and
[1:03:43] fellowship with
[1:03:47] him I'm sorry to tell you but it ain't
[1:03:50] only the denominations anymore it's in
[1:03:52] this message that God's kicking they're
[1:03:54] kicking God out
[1:03:56] they're going with their Traditions
[1:03:58] they're going with their own belief
[1:03:59] they're kicking the prophet's word out
[1:04:01] and they're living what they think is
[1:04:03] right because of head knowledge and not
[1:04:06] a heart knowledge what we put in here
[1:04:09] has to go down in here it has to come
[1:04:12] through dying out it comes through
[1:04:14] suffering and pain and Agony to get us
[1:04:18] to a place in our
[1:04:21] lives that we know who we
[1:04:24] are and so
[1:04:27] now
[1:04:28] Joshua he
[1:04:30] says he divided the land to the
[1:04:34] people and now he says that Christ
[1:04:37] brought the
[1:04:40] church to right
[1:04:42] there but now the holy
[1:04:45] spirit is giving
[1:04:49] them where his where they're supposed to
[1:04:52] be so who's this great tutor today
[1:04:56] is he here in your heart today is he
[1:04:59] teaching you how to live as Christians
[1:05:02] ladies and sons of God
[1:05:05] today or do you have your own
[1:05:08] thinking or are you just wishing that
[1:05:11] you could be just like Peter in the
[1:05:15] Bible Peter had to die out just like you
[1:05:18] and me he had to he had to surrender his
[1:05:21] heart his soul to God and let God be the
[1:05:25] operator
[1:05:26] of that
[1:05:29] Soul we need to quit
[1:05:32] thinking and start believing The
[1:05:37] Impossible we don't need to understand
[1:05:40] we just need to know who the author is
[1:05:43] and if we know who the author is he's
[1:05:45] going to place you because now he's in
[1:05:47] control of you right and if he's in
[1:05:50] control of me I'm going to produce
[1:05:53] exactly what he made me for
[1:05:56] amen and so
[1:05:59] now he goes on he is the voice of God
[1:06:03] speaking through the inner man that
[1:06:06] Christ was saved the Holy Spirit now do
[1:06:11] you get that much now we're getting over
[1:06:15] into the book Ephesians now the same way
[1:06:19] he's positionally placing the church
[1:06:22] where they belong that's where I got my
[1:06:24] thought Joshua placing them into the
[1:06:27] natural land now the holy spirit is
[1:06:31] placing the church positionally in the
[1:06:33] land that they in the position that they
[1:06:37] belong in their
[1:06:41] inheritance we don't have to wait until
[1:06:43] our body
[1:06:46] change there's people out there in this
[1:06:48] message thinks we already we already got
[1:06:50] our full adoption if that was the
[1:06:53] case why do I still got great hair why
[1:06:56] am I still 54 years old I don't look
[1:06:59] like I'm 18 years
[1:07:02] old I had muscles my muscles are down
[1:07:05] here
[1:07:06] now they're down
[1:07:08] here I used to have good biceps and I
[1:07:11] had good muscles up here had good legs I
[1:07:14] can't even run from here to the door
[1:07:15] without falling down on my face unless
[1:07:17] I'm
[1:07:22] anointed we need to stick with the
[1:07:24] prophet of God what he said on
[1:07:27] tape we need to quit telling
[1:07:32] people we need to tell them exactly what
[1:07:34] the prophet of God's saying and leave it
[1:07:37] there because we can say it all day long
[1:07:40] but if you do not get the Revelation
[1:07:42] you're going to be stunned you're going
[1:07:44] to be there going what is that guy
[1:07:46] telling us he's telling we supposed to
[1:07:48] have it because we got the Holy Ghost I
[1:07:49] know I've got the Holy Ghost and I pray
[1:07:51] for this person he's never got healed
[1:07:54] yet doesn't work that
[1:07:56] way prob that God says he's only he said
[1:08:00] Rapture is already in
[1:08:04] you the power is already in you he said
[1:08:08] he can't give it to you all at one time
[1:08:10] because you can't handle
[1:08:12] it but it comes to a place where the
[1:08:16] dying out gets to a place where he gives
[1:08:20] you the power to be more Overcomers than
[1:08:23] what you're thinking in your mind
[1:08:25] because we said here sometimes and
[1:08:26] battle our mind saying well I'm supposed
[1:08:28] to be an overcomer but I can't even get
[1:08:30] over this I can't even stop looking at
[1:08:32] girls I can't stop looking at boys I
[1:08:35] can't I can't behave around my Mom and
[1:08:37] Daddy I can't do this I can't do that I
[1:08:39] can't do this yes you
[1:08:41] can get your eyes on the book get it off
[1:08:45] of the mirror at yourself get Jesus
[1:08:47] looking at him and asking him to help
[1:08:50] you and he will place you exactly where
[1:08:52] you're supposed to be
[1:09:00] we've got to come to a place that Jesus
[1:09:02] Christ is everything to
[1:09:06] you praise be to God Romans 8 and 18 it
[1:09:11] says for I reckon that thy suffering of
[1:09:14] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:09:17] compared to the glory which shall be
[1:09:20] revealed in them
[1:09:26] and somebody else down the
[1:09:28] road but in
[1:09:30] US instead of putting us we need to put
[1:09:33] me revealing to
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:36] me you got to look at this Bible and say
[1:09:39] he's talking to
[1:09:41] me I'm the one that's predestinated I'm
[1:09:45] the one that he died for I'm the one
[1:09:47] that he called I'm the one that he was
[1:09:49] looking at before the foundations of the
[1:09:51] world it was
[1:09:53] me that ain't being bold that's just the
[1:09:58] truth truth will set you
[1:10:01] free but the devil has kicked you and
[1:10:04] made you think you're
[1:10:07] nothing but when we get to a place in
[1:10:10] our lives that Jesus Christ is
[1:10:12] everything to you and me something will
[1:10:17] happen for the earnest expectation of
[1:10:20] the Creator waited for the
[1:10:23] manifestations of the sons of the devil
[1:10:28] no sons of
[1:10:32] God not when you get your body changed
[1:10:36] when you get your body changed you're
[1:10:38] going to have power over Earth and
[1:10:46] Heaven positionally place the church
[1:10:48] where they belong each one how we're
[1:10:52] called by predestination
[1:10:55] or
[1:10:58] adoption God has adopted us into the
[1:11:01] sons we're Sons by birth adopted and
[1:11:05] positionally placed by the Holy Spirit
[1:11:07] look they were everyone Hebrews when
[1:11:12] they crossed the
[1:11:14] river but Joshua divided the land and
[1:11:18] gave each one his
[1:11:21] land according to the utterance of his
[1:11:24] mother
[1:11:26] at
[1:11:31] Birth this joshu was going to do the
[1:11:33] same thing to
[1:11:36] you God in his mind already knew exactly
[1:11:39] where you were going to be on this Earth
[1:11:42] and he was going to make
[1:11:46] sure that's why he came down and he died
[1:11:49] on the calvary for you and I that's the
[1:11:51] reason why you and I have to go through
[1:11:53] the three steps
[1:11:56] because if we don't go through the three
[1:11:58] steps each one of them has trials and
[1:12:00] tribulations and wars and and things
[1:12:03] because you got to
[1:12:05] wrestle with your own self you've got to
[1:12:07] learn to be Overcomers with this if you
[1:12:10] can be Overcomers with this then you'll
[1:12:12] be Overcomers with every devil in
[1:12:16] hell Peter was looking out of his eyes
[1:12:20] and the strength that he had and the
[1:12:22] Zeal that he
[1:12:23] had they won't kill you I'll Fight for
[1:12:26] You Lord I'll cut that man's ear off he
[1:12:29] did didn't he he got rebuked for it
[1:12:34] too God don't need our help we need
[1:12:37] God's
[1:12:38] help we need to get to a place that he's
[1:12:42] thus sayith the Lord he's the one that's
[1:12:45] placing his bride he's the one that's
[1:12:47] got the church but what about the
[1:12:49] individuals
[1:12:50] today what about
[1:12:54] you he's got to get you ready so that
[1:12:57] you can be placed in the
[1:13:02] church hello
[1:13:05] somebody so now he goes on and he
[1:13:09] says look they were Hebrews right
[1:13:14] because of the utterance of their
[1:13:16] mother at Birth and now the book of
[1:13:21] Ephesians draws it together and
[1:13:24] positionally places the church now
[1:13:26] you've typed it with Joshua I typed it
[1:13:29] with Joshua he said if you notice Israel
[1:13:32] was brought up out of Egypt and there
[1:13:36] were three stages of their Journey one
[1:13:39] stage was leaving Egypt the next stage
[1:13:43] was leaving the Wilderness the next
[1:13:45] stage was
[1:13:48] canadan there are three stages for us
[1:13:51] one stage is justification the next is
[1:13:55] sanctification the next is the baptism
[1:13:57] of the Holy Ghost these three is labor
[1:14:01] pains
[1:14:04] hello how many can tell me that when you
[1:14:07] came to the altar in your car or
[1:14:09] wherever you gave your heart to God and
[1:14:11] it was not labor
[1:14:14] pains how many here that was so happy
[1:14:16] and tickled that they can say God I was
[1:14:18] a righteous oh Sinner and I use you in
[1:14:20] the name of all the name the vein and
[1:14:23] all kinds of things no you were sorrow
[1:14:25] you was crying you was asking God to
[1:14:27] forgive you you asked God to help me I'm
[1:14:29] a sinner Lord I know I need you today
[1:14:32] because if not I'm going straight to
[1:14:34] Hell the pits of hell is opened up it's
[1:14:36] ready for me Lord but Lord I need you
[1:14:39] Lord that's birth pains you you are
[1:14:42] struggling in that first age so was so
[1:14:45] was uh Israel when they were bound up by
[1:14:49] task Masters and being beaten and
[1:14:51] slaughtered every day people were dying
[1:14:54] because they believe belied in a God
[1:14:55] that was going to get him out in 400
[1:14:57] years and God waited for 4 40 years to
[1:15:01] get him
[1:15:04] out but what was
[1:15:08] it birth pains they had to go through
[1:15:11] birth pains to
[1:15:14] be able to listen to God for the next
[1:15:18] stage of their
[1:15:20] life we've got to die
[1:15:23] out we we got to get to a place that God
[1:15:26] is everything to
[1:15:28] us because when you gave your heart to
[1:15:31] God you recognize that you were a sinner
[1:15:34] but they were habits living inside of
[1:15:36] your heart that had to be cleaned up
[1:15:39] they had to come out of thy heart they
[1:15:42] had to come out so that God can place
[1:15:44] you in the next
[1:15:50] stage they went into the
[1:15:52] Wilderness and because of their Stu
[1:15:55] berness they listen to man instead of
[1:15:57] what God told them that they would be
[1:15:58] able to walk across there and take their
[1:16:01] Mountain they wouldn't listen to the
[1:16:03] ones that had the fruits of the spirit
[1:16:05] upon them they they listen to the ones
[1:16:08] that didn't have nothing and they had
[1:16:09] fear and fear fell upon two million
[1:16:16] people and they had to die in the
[1:16:19] wilderness but the Next Generation had
[1:16:22] to
[1:16:23] suffer and go around that mountain until
[1:16:27] they came to a place that God was ready
[1:16:29] and they were ready to listen to
[1:16:32] God Moses LED them to the water but they
[1:16:36] had to cross
[1:16:39] it he brought them to their
[1:16:42] inheritance but because of the Harden of
[1:16:44] their hearts and I believe it's same way
[1:16:46] in this message today people have went
[1:16:48] to from justification and sanctification
[1:16:52] and got touched by God and they think
[1:16:54] they have the the Holy
[1:16:55] Ghost and they're standing there say I
[1:16:58] got the Holy Ghost and they're taking
[1:16:59] communion knowing that they don't have
[1:17:01] the Holy Ghost because they're too
[1:17:04] scared to stay in their seat and make
[1:17:07] sure they get the Holy
[1:17:09] Ghost so you're drinking in damnation
[1:17:12] unto
[1:17:15] yourself your
[1:17:17] attitude when you walk through that
[1:17:19] church can cause somebody to miss out on
[1:17:22] their healing
[1:17:26] your life is not worthy of the Gospel it
[1:17:29] can hinder somebody else in this church
[1:17:31] yeah right brother will give me a quote
[1:17:33] I
[1:17:36] will but we're going through labor
[1:17:39] pains how that God has set some in the
[1:17:43] church through the labor pains oh they
[1:17:46] great tremendous sometimes when the
[1:17:50] church is groaning under the pr uh the
[1:17:54] pre ution of the outside world Believing
[1:17:58] on the Lord Jesus that the promise of
[1:18:00] the Holy Ghost is just a real as was in
[1:18:04] the Pentecost how they groan and cried
[1:18:07] under the labor pains but when they are
[1:18:12] born and positionally born in the
[1:18:15] kingdom of God that's the when God can
[1:18:19] start using them that's where God starts
[1:18:22] getting the five-fold ministry going
[1:18:24] they get The Mamas and mamas learning
[1:18:27] how to take care of their children
[1:18:29] there's gifts there on the mamas there's
[1:18:31] gifts the nine spiritual gifts are
[1:18:33] operating under the Holy Ghost when them
[1:18:36] people have suffered through these three
[1:18:38] stages and in this last
[1:18:41] stage they've got the Holy Spirit deity
[1:18:45] living inside of
[1:18:47] them you have a portion brother you have
[1:18:50] a portion of deity living in you when
[1:18:52] you got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:55] so who's going to speak through you
[1:18:58] deity is going to be speaking through
[1:19:00] you and through that deity you're going
[1:19:03] to conquer the
[1:19:05] world you are possessors of this Earth
[1:19:09] this is your land amen but you've got to
[1:19:13] conquer this first before you can
[1:19:15] conquer
[1:19:17] this this is where a lot of people are
[1:19:20] today is because they haven't conquered
[1:19:22] this
[1:19:26] brother BR says people don't even have
[1:19:28] enough faith for a
[1:19:31] headache
[1:19:33] why because they're looking at the
[1:19:35] circumstances more than God's promises
[1:19:37] we need to die out to ourselves we need
[1:19:40] to give God
[1:19:42] everything but we want it
[1:19:48] easy my little lady my little sweetheart
[1:19:52] while we were in New Mexico she had a
[1:19:55] mind gr headache she couldn't even see
[1:19:57] she was
[1:19:58] just in her bedroom there we had to
[1:20:00] sleep in different rooms cuz the beds
[1:20:02] were small and she was in there and had
[1:20:04] the curtain down and walking by her door
[1:20:08] her head was banging cuz the doors were
[1:20:10] loose and it would vibrate she would
[1:20:12] just she would just go in oh it was
[1:20:15] hurting
[1:20:17] her but that little lady got up on a
[1:20:21] Saturday morning packed the bags got in
[1:20:24] the car with me and went 4 hours and
[1:20:27] served the Lord and was a testimony to
[1:20:30] the church in Pine
[1:20:35] Top before we left that headache was
[1:20:39] gone we're going to fight Church we're
[1:20:41] going to war and we can't go to war
[1:20:44] staying at home we've got to come to
[1:20:46] church and fight we got to fight at work
[1:20:48] if we got to fight at home we've got to
[1:20:50] get the devil
[1:20:52] out who are we
[1:20:57] are we sons of the devil or are we sons
[1:20:59] of
[1:21:01] God because the denomination says that
[1:21:04] they're sons of God and they got more
[1:21:06] Victory than some in here some of us
[1:21:09] because I'm I'm hit there with you

[1:21:35] even have a pastor for 11 years but they
[1:21:38] were standing on their Promises of God
[1:21:41] they kept coming to church without a
[1:21:43] pastor
[1:21:46] leading listening to a church message
[1:21:50] listening to somebody that would come
[1:21:51] and preach but come on Sunday morning
[1:21:54] and cry out to God for 11 years in birth
[1:21:59] pains and
[1:22:02] struggles and they love each
[1:22:04] other they don't talk bad about each
[1:22:07] other they love one another they leave

[1:24:41] anything I can't even hardly sit I can't
[1:24:43] even hardly breathe and we laid hands on
[1:24:45] her the very next day it would quit
[1:24:49] hurting she recognized who she was she
[1:24:53] was a daughter of God
[1:24:55] the only thing she had to do is believe
[1:24:56] that God was going to let her go on
[1:24:58] their 50th
[1:25:01] Anniversary his sinus has quit two hours
[1:25:05] after me and my wife left and he go I
[1:25:07] haven't had that same problem
[1:25:12] since what is
[1:25:15] it right is waking
[1:25:17] up the individuals are starting to see
[1:25:20] where they're
[1:25:21] at where are we at tonight Church as an
[1:25:25] individual not a church because I
[1:25:27] believe every one of you are Christians
[1:25:30] but we need to step up a little bit
[1:25:31] don't
[1:25:32] we why don't we let God Place us tonight
[1:25:36] exactly where he wants us and that is
[1:25:39] complete control over every demon
[1:25:42] everything that comes around you you
[1:25:44] should be have the power to say Satan
[1:25:46] get behind
[1:25:48] me brother William I don't have my body
[1:25:50] changed yet okay Joshua Joshua 1 says be
[1:25:56] strong and of good courage For unto the
[1:26:00] this people shall thy divide for an
[1:26:02] inheritance of the land which I showed
[1:26:05] unto their fathers to give them only be
[1:26:10] thou strong and and very and very
[1:26:13] encouraged that thou mayest observe to
[1:26:17] do according to all the law now remember
[1:26:21] they're living by a law they never had
[1:26:24] the Holy
[1:26:26] Ghost they had a
[1:26:28] prophet and some of them murmured and
[1:26:30] complained about the
[1:26:32] prophet we might not say nothing against
[1:26:34] the prophet but we murmur against what
[1:26:36] he preaches because if we didn't murmur
[1:26:39] we wouldn't be doing the things that
[1:26:40] we're doing today we would be listening
[1:26:43] to God and we would be listening to him
[1:26:45] and we would be more than conquerors
[1:26:47] today we have examples that had cancer
[1:26:49] in this church and it's
[1:26:51] gone because they kept believing and
[1:26:54] kept kept telling the pastor I don't
[1:26:55] want you to keep telling him about it I
[1:26:58] am
[1:26:59] healed and God took her faith and today
[1:27:03] she's sitting here and she's know she's
[1:27:05] cancer free why because she belied who
[1:27:07] she
[1:27:09] is she trusts on one man and that's God
[1:27:13] he she loves her husband she'll take
[1:27:14] good care of him but she trusts in God's
[1:27:18] word for her hope and
[1:27:22] glory and so now he goes on and he
[1:27:25] says which Moses my servant commanded
[1:27:29] thee turn not from it to be the right
[1:27:32] hand or to the left that thou mayest
[1:27:36] Prosper whether soever thou
[1:27:40] goest isn't our Prophet said the same
[1:27:42] thing for us to this
[1:27:46] day this book of the law should not
[1:27:49] depart out of thy mouth but thou shall
[1:27:53] meditate therein day and night that thou
[1:27:56] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:28:00] that is written therein for for then
[1:28:04] Thou shalt make thy way
[1:28:07] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[1:28:12] excess have not I command thee be strong
[1:28:17] and of good
[1:28:19] courage Be not Afraid neither be thou
[1:28:23] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[1:28:26] thee wherever soever thou
[1:28:33] goest our own Prophet preached sermons
[1:28:37] after sermons on that
[1:28:41] promise each now this is where I read
[1:28:45] that that one right before this quote
[1:28:47] and now he goes each the land was
[1:28:49] provide provided and divided up by
[1:28:53] inspiration ation and each one could
[1:28:57] take the scripture and show it to to you
[1:29:01] exactly that he put them in their place
[1:29:05] where they were supposed to be
[1:29:07] positionally how that they too have
[1:29:10] tribes was to stay across the river how
[1:29:14] that the mothers
[1:29:16] cried that in their birth and how that
[1:29:20] each place was supposed to be and now
[1:29:24] after you are in that don't mean that
[1:29:28] you're out free from
[1:29:31] war you still have to fight for every
[1:29:34] inch of ground you stand
[1:29:37] on so see Caden did not represent the
[1:29:41] great Heavens because it's war and
[1:29:45] troubles and killings and fighting and
[1:29:48] so forth but it did pre present this
[1:29:52] that it must be a perfect
[1:29:57] walk they had to live by the
[1:30:01] law you and I don't have to live by the
[1:30:05] law we live by
[1:30:08] Grace when we make a mistake the blood's
[1:30:11] there but a man and daughter of God they
[1:30:15] will do everything they can and not sin
[1:30:20] the best that they
[1:30:21] can but what happens is we let this
[1:30:25] start
[1:30:27] wandering in the Caden land oh I wish I
[1:30:30] could have that piece of property oh I
[1:30:32] wish I can have that piece of property
[1:30:35] oh I could wish I could put my my corn
[1:30:37] on that piece of property because I know
[1:30:38] it'll really
[1:30:44] grow and then after a little
[1:30:47] while they get so quiet they get so out
[1:30:52] of tune with themselves and God
[1:30:54] and before long things happen and when
[1:30:57] something happens to them they go oh no
[1:31:00] oh I'm sick oh I'm this and that oh
[1:31:03] everybody hates my guts everybody's
[1:31:04] talking about me oh I do this and I do
[1:31:08] that why are we letting the devil kick
[1:31:10] us like a football all the time we are
[1:31:13] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:31:16] now not tomorrow but
[1:31:20] now and now after you are in that don't
[1:31:25] mean that you're out of free war he
[1:31:28] said there's where the church is falling
[1:31:31] today on their walk do you know that
[1:31:35] even your own behavior here's that quote
[1:31:39] I want to read to you your own behavior
[1:31:41] can knock somebody else out of getting
[1:31:45] healed your
[1:31:49] misbehavior of unconfessed sin of your
[1:31:52] believers can cause the church to barely
[1:31:56] fa fail at the day of judgment he said
[1:32:01] you'll be responsible for every bit of
[1:32:05] it when you come through that doors you
[1:32:09] should be in love with God and love with
[1:32:11] everybody in the church why do you have
[1:32:14] to wait till you get right here and get
[1:32:15] right with God you should be getting
[1:32:17] ready for ready for God and God's
[1:32:19] children loving everybody when you're
[1:32:21] driving to work at your house
[1:32:24] I know this is hurting you guys I
[1:32:31] know why can't we have love out there
[1:32:34] but we'll go home with our own
[1:32:37] clicks and we'll talk about everybody in
[1:32:39] the church and we're all we all holy
[1:32:42] holy you ain't
[1:32:45] holy backbiters are not going
[1:32:48] unbelievers are not going but what is
[1:32:51] going is a man of God and a daughter of
[1:32:53] of God that is surrounded by the love of
[1:32:56] God living inside of them and they're
[1:32:58] producing the word that's what's
[1:33:02] going that's where God's placing those
[1:33:05] people are we one of them
[1:33:07] tonight but now they did all these years
[1:33:12] until now now we have the earnest of our
[1:33:16] inheritance oh my what do we have we
[1:33:21] have the evidence that God Liv lives we
[1:33:25] have the evidence that God is with us we
[1:33:28] have the evidence that
[1:33:29] God has not forsaken us that we are his
[1:33:34] and he is ours because we in our bodies
[1:33:39] we now Tabernacle of the holy spirit of
[1:33:42] God that cry out AB the father and
[1:33:46] there's nothing can ever take that away
[1:33:50] we are Anchored In what Christ
[1:33:55] that's why we got to go through these
[1:33:56] steps and be diligent in each one of
[1:33:58] these steps church because the first one
[1:34:01] can't get completed and when it is
[1:34:04] completed then you go into the next step
[1:34:06] what is he doing he's washing you
[1:34:09] cleaning you getting you prepared for
[1:34:12] what he wants you to do not when you get
[1:34:14] your body changed he wants to get you
[1:34:17] prepared that the Holy Spirit deity of
[1:34:19] God living inside of you today can
[1:34:22] conquer this mountain
[1:34:24] all right amen this
[1:34:27] inheritance
[1:34:28] Hallelujah he's giv you a body but today
[1:34:32] you've got to have be under control of
[1:34:35] this well brother William I can lay
[1:34:37] hands on the sick and they
[1:34:40] recover because God is looking at their
[1:34:43] faith because he said lay hands on the
[1:34:46] sick and they shall recover that person
[1:34:48] when you lay hands on them they're
[1:34:50] believing what you said and they get
[1:34:52] there what they need
[1:34:55] but why can't we lay hands on ourselves
[1:34:57] and say Satan I'm sick and tired of you
[1:35:00] come out of me in the name of
[1:35:06] Jesus because we're looking in the
[1:35:08] mirror too
[1:35:09] much you're seeing that old man instead
[1:35:13] of seeing the promise that God gave you
[1:35:16] before the foundations of the world
[1:35:18] that's why people can't get this
[1:35:29] because why they don't know who they are
[1:35:32] they have all the tapes they got the
[1:35:34] message and they can they can tell
[1:35:35] somebody about it but they don't have it
[1:35:37] in
[1:35:39] themselves I love this quote right here
[1:35:42] you want to go read a good message go
[1:35:44] read this is back in 1952 not not 60 not
[1:35:48] 61 not 63 not 65 not 66 this is 1952
[1:35:56] thou knowest all things he said it's in
[1:36:01] me eternal
[1:36:02] life now we are the sons of God not we
[1:36:06] will be we are now that's what the
[1:36:09] trouble is says you absolutely are in
[1:36:13] there Ephesians 4 and3 says say grieve
[1:36:17] not the holy spirit of God whereby Ye Ye
[1:36:21] excuse me where for you're sealed until
[1:36:26] the day of your
[1:36:30] Redemption you have the earnest because
[1:36:32] he died for you he paid your price for
[1:36:35] you now he in the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:38] Ghost he's placing you in your
[1:36:41] inheritance he's letting you get your
[1:36:43] place in the place where you can use the
[1:36:46] faith and the power that he gave you to
[1:36:48] be Overcomers of this because when
[1:36:50] you're Overcomers with this you're
[1:36:52] Overcomers with Satan
[1:36:54] and all his
[1:36:56] demons because this is where he's
[1:36:58] attacking you this is where he caus you
[1:37:00] pain this is where he gives you the
[1:37:02] headaches this is where he gives you the
[1:37:04] the
[1:37:06] cancer you get a stomach ache oh you go
[1:37:09] to the doctor doctor talks to
[1:37:14] this I got cancer I better get my wheel
[1:37:18] up I want to die no I'm more than a
[1:37:22] conqueror in Christ Jesus
[1:37:24] Jesus Satan get behind
[1:37:31] me look back to your sacrifice those
[1:37:34] stripes are for my
[1:37:37] healing that blood that was coming out
[1:37:40] of him is to wash me clean wash all
[1:37:43] unbelief
[1:37:45] out to get me to a place that I can get
[1:37:48] her out of the way and let God Place me
[1:37:51] in my inheritance
[1:37:56] and so he goes on and he
[1:38:00] says he
[1:38:02] goes let the devil kick you around
[1:38:06] that's the trouble of it today another
[1:38:09] Christian person that's sitting here
[1:38:12] sick if they only knew that they were
[1:38:16] Sons and Daughters of God now living
[1:38:19] with them not you will be now you are

[1:38:41] accepting hour of the Lord now is when
[1:38:45] healing is supposed to be now is when
[1:38:49] Miracles take place now when the Christ
[1:38:52] is revealed and himself to to himself
[1:38:56] wait now he is when Christ is revealed
[1:39:00] unto himself here we are now not in the
[1:39:04] future the devil keeps pushing it off
[1:39:08] that's
[1:39:10] cism now is that today there is the hour
[1:39:15] there is the time and there is a
[1:39:17] place right now this is the day to serve
[1:39:22] the Lord this is the
[1:39:24] day to wash th mind out this is the day
[1:39:28] to get yourself ready for a Rapture
[1:39:30] today is the day that you are going to
[1:39:33] fight every devil you're going to stand
[1:39:35] behind the word and the word is going to
[1:39:37] come through you because there's deity
[1:39:39] living inside of you today you say you
[1:39:42] got the Holy Ghost then you have all the
[1:39:44] power that you need for your
[1:39:47] journey you just have to believe it it's

[1:40:07] way and every devil that comes with your
[1:40:09] children you should fight them kill
[1:40:11] them and you need to sit them down and
[1:40:13] tell them what you are what they are
[1:40:18] they're Sons and Daughters of
[1:40:20] God before the foundations of the world
[1:40:23] not because of they're your
[1:40:25] kids God claimed them before you even
[1:40:27] was
[1:40:30] born they only have a nature like you
[1:40:33] but that nature won't be there in heaven
[1:40:36] it'll be a cleaned up
[1:40:38] nature it won't be a rebellion nature it
[1:40:40] won't be unbelief
[1:40:42] nature but it'll be power but you should
[1:40:45] have it today you don't have to wait for
[1:40:47] your body change brother Kevin it's
[1:40:50] today it's yours
[1:40:53] you should be able to lay hands on the
[1:40:55] sick brother William I don't think so oh
[1:40:57] yes you do he said Pentecost was 1900
[1:41:00] years ago but it's still
[1:41:02] going that's why Peter and John can walk
[1:41:05] by the go to the synagogue to go pray
[1:41:07] and when they started they saw the
[1:41:08] beggar there and he walked up and saids
[1:41:10] silver and gold I have none but what I
[1:41:12] do have such as I give unto thee in the
[1:41:14] name of Jesus picked him up and he
[1:41:17] walked and praise
[1:41:19] God he had the Holy Ghost and he didn't
[1:41:22] have a body ch
[1:41:23] change he had the earnest of the body
[1:41:27] change now he had the life now he had
[1:41:31] the power now he had the glory now he
[1:41:35] has Sons and Daughters of God
[1:41:39] now because
[1:41:41] why he got himself out of the
[1:41:44] way he saw all his troubles what he did
[1:41:47] before Calvary but after Calvary he was
[1:41:50] still with his rip over his mouth but
[1:41:52] one day God
[1:41:54] said and go and go g it Peter bring him
[1:41:59] to

[1:47:04] glory we are waiting for the fullness of
[1:47:07] the adoption he says this will take
[1:47:10] place when at the first
[1:47:14] resurrection that's when our bodies will

[1:47:43] likeness we will have a body like his a
[1:47:47] glory glorified body and all the trials
[1:47:51] and struggles of life life will fade off
[1:47:54] into the little mist of blow away to
[1:47:58] never be no
[1:48:01] more now in the Old Testament when the
[1:48:04] son was born in the home he was a son
[1:48:09] because he was born in the house my son
[1:48:12] brother my son is my son when he was
[1:48:15] born to me and when the Pentecost Church
[1:48:20] gave birth
[1:48:22] and found that they were called the
[1:48:25] birth the new birth oh the Holy Ghost
[1:48:29] Church that they were born in the
[1:48:32] kingdom of
[1:48:35] God what did I just
[1:48:37] say when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:48:41] are born in the kingdom of God so who
[1:48:45] has the power right
[1:48:48] now Sons and Daughters of God now
[1:48:55] Amen brother brand said this I'm not
[1:48:58] going to read it but he this is I'm
[1:48:59] going to just quote it out you can go
[1:49:01] back and read it
[1:49:03] yourself he said you can't
[1:49:06] go and get on somebody else's property
[1:49:10] and do your
[1:49:13] corn you can't go over here and use this
[1:49:16] other person's on corn to do these
[1:49:18] things you've got to get in your own
[1:49:21] land yeah
[1:49:23] you've got to you've got to plant the
[1:49:25] seed in your own
[1:49:28] yard so the power that you have the
[1:49:31] fruits of the spirit will come from you
[1:49:35] from
[1:49:38] Glory they say that you have to be able
[1:49:41] to speak in tongues every one of us need
[1:49:43] to speak in tongues brother R says
[1:49:45] that's
[1:49:47] wrong he said you all have to prophesy
[1:49:50] and things like that he goes no that's
[1:49:51] wrong
[1:49:55] he goes
[1:49:57] no because one person might speak in
[1:50:01] tongues that's their fruits of the
[1:50:03] spirit the other one Tates the other
[1:50:06] one's a Healer the next one's a preacher
[1:50:08] the next one's a a prophet the next
[1:50:10] one's this the next one's that the next
[1:50:12] one's a mama the next one's a daddy the
[1:50:14] next one's a son next one's a daughter
[1:50:16] it's in the God's
[1:50:18] economy but God has to place you in your
[1:50:22] her
[1:50:27] let the fivefold ministry preach the
[1:50:30] word the church needs to accept the word
[1:50:34] and the word will place you exactly
[1:50:37] where you got to be if you
[1:50:42] believe you should be able to lay hands
[1:50:45] on the sick you little
[1:50:49] ones you should be able to walk in there
[1:50:52] on your your mama or your daddy when
[1:50:54] they're not feeling good and say silver
[1:50:57] and gold I have none but what God has
[1:51:00] given me in the name of Jesus get off my
[1:51:02] Daddy get off my mama get off my brother
[1:51:05] get off my sister get off my pastor get
[1:51:07] off my pastor's wife get off my song
[1:51:12] leader it's time for you to take
[1:51:15] authority of who you
[1:51:18] are but brother William I don't
[1:51:20] understand because you're not getting in
[1:51:22] the book and finding yourself in there
[1:51:25] you're listening to a message but you're
[1:51:27] not studying it for
[1:51:31] yourself you could tell your pastor that
[1:51:33] you listen to a message wonderful what
[1:51:35] did it do for
[1:51:38] you I listened to four messages this
[1:51:42] week but I was working and I can tell
[1:51:45] you certain things I things I could say
[1:51:48] but when I started studying it so that I
[1:51:52] would be able to help a congregation or
[1:51:56] a church anywhere I go I want to make
[1:51:59] sure that I'm preaching under the
[1:52:01] inspiration of the word for that
[1:52:05] day I want God to be leading me to a
[1:52:09] Rapture but when I preach I want to give
[1:52:12] somebody a drink of water so they can
[1:52:15] have the same
[1:52:21] experience that's why brother window
[1:52:23] labors on these things it's because
[1:52:27] there is some people here that's going
[1:52:28] to speak in tongues there is some that's
[1:52:30] going to be able to sit in their home
[1:52:33] and pray and things are going to happen
[1:52:35] Miracles are going to
[1:52:39] happen it wasn't just for the Pentecost
[1:52:42] back then it's for you
[1:52:45] now the hope of glory is in
[1:52:48] you if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:52:51] it's time to find an alt
[1:52:53] well brother will I don't want people to
[1:52:55] think I don't have the altar because I
[1:52:56] I've done this and done
[1:52:59] that who cares what we think you better
[1:53:03] think what he thinks because he's the
[1:53:05] one's going to place
[1:53:07] you he's going to place us one or the
[1:53:09] other he going to place Us in the
[1:53:11] Kingdom of Heaven or you're going to be
[1:53:12] placed in somewhere it's going to be
[1:53:14] hot so who are
[1:53:18] we he's placed in US everything I read
[1:53:21] is right out of the Bible and now of the
[1:53:22] message of the hour
[1:53:25] today and we stumble when a man says
[1:53:28] that we got deity in us and the prophet
[1:53:31] of God said it many many times he goes
[1:53:34] you got a portion of deity leing in you
[1:53:36] right
[1:53:38] now every
[1:53:40] Power everything that you need to go
[1:53:42] into a Rapture he said it's already in
[1:53:44] your soul you just have to learn how to
[1:53:47] operate it and a way to is that is to
[1:53:49] get out of the way and let him come
[1:53:53] the holy spirit will come through you
[1:53:55] and make a testimony out of
[1:53:57] you but you've got to get to a place
[1:54:01] church now Shake It
[1:54:04] Off and grab it behind your head and
[1:54:07] find that Nazarite
[1:54:10] vow and kill every devil that's in hell
[1:54:14] out of your
[1:54:17] life if you love these young
[1:54:19] people let us be an example to these
[1:54:22] young people
[1:54:25] these young
[1:54:30] teenagers need
[1:54:34] examples ministers it's time to step
[1:54:38] up if you're not going to step up you
[1:54:40] need to step

[1:55:00] word of God and he's good to his wife
[1:55:03] and he's good to his children that Mom
[1:55:05] and children look up to him and say
[1:55:08] there's nothing but love of God out of
[1:55:11] that
[1:55:17] man I failed my daughter many
[1:55:21] times I've jumped a gun many times but

[1:57:49] here and work to pay their
[1:57:54] bills and to do things the way he did

[1:58:08] lady that wanted to help
[1:58:14] us I couldn't get this house that I want
[1:58:17] to get because I had too much

[1:58:36] God I'm scared to death
[1:58:38] church but one thing I'm not scared of

[1:58:47] says if you believe me and you abide in
[1:58:50] my laws and you lift for me I'll stand
[1:58:54] behind
[1:58:55] you signs and wonders are following me

[1:59:13] here as a
[1:59:15] deacon and I would preach on everything

[1:59:26] me and I've already apologized to
[1:59:29] brother Wendell but I'm want to tell you
[1:59:32] something because I did
[1:59:35] that something on the inside of me had
[1:59:37] died out and today I want you to know
[1:59:42] that when I preach this gospel I believe
[1:59:46] it I've seen people come out of the
[1:59:49] Grave I've seen people come come knowing
[1:59:53] that they were going to die in the next
[1:59:55] few hours and lay hands on them and they

[2:00:07] had hate for a husband and hate for a
[2:00:10] cousin asked me he said brother William
[2:00:12] am I going to go to heaven because I I
[2:00:14] can't get this out of my mind I said no

[2:05:19] real it's time to R rise up this evening
[2:05:23] and ask
[2:05:25] God take tonight think about
[2:05:28] it where are you sitting where are you
[2:05:30] standing
[2:05:32] at are you cold you don't have to be

[2:05:51] we're Christi Christians that he died
[2:05:53] for you and I we should be the happiest
[2:05:56] people upon this Earth but what do we do
[2:05:58] we shun ourselves and hide
[2:06:03] ourselves
[2:06:06] why because we're letting the devil kick
[2:06:08] us like a football it's time to rise
[2:06:11] church it's time to act like
[2:06:14] Christians because the day of
[2:06:17] judgment you're going to be up there or
[2:06:19] you going to be down there where are you
[2:06:21] going want to be I want to be in heaven
[2:06:24] I want to be with him
[2:06:28] reigning with him forever

[2:06:35] church as a musicians

[2:06:55] I was in the back room listening to our
[2:06:57] sisters sing and I was
[2:07:03] shouting and when the Lord was revealing
[2:07:06] to me this is the message I was going to
[2:07:11] preach something came by me
[2:07:16] and and I went into my scriptures and
[2:07:21] and I saw it but if you go back and you
[2:07:25] read in Gala in Galatians from 1 to
[2:07:29] 7 that sums up who we are as
[2:07:37] Christians but brothers and
[2:07:39] sisters we've got to
[2:07:41] live in our
[2:07:44] testimony we've got to live in this word
[2:07:49] with all of our hearts
[2:07:52] if we don't
[2:07:54] live with all of our
[2:07:57] hearts then you could cause somebody in
[2:08:00] here not get a blessing because of
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:10] you I don't want to be
[2:08:14] guilty it's very important when we come
[2:08:17] to

[2:08:22] around each
[2:08:25] other brother William's going to be gone

[2:09:04] it they believe that they're they're
[2:09:08] Christians but what about
[2:09:10] us we've been bought by our price we
[2:09:14] know Malachi
[2:09:16] 4 and we don't bring our hands up like
[2:09:19] this

[2:24:08] Tempest May
[2:24:10] sweep or the
[2:24:13] wild stormy deep oh but in Jesus
[2:24:21] I'm
[2:24:22] safe ever
[2:24:27] more
[2:24:28] oh I've
[2:24:31] anchored my
[2:24:34] soul in the
[2:24:37] Haven of
[2:24:40] Rest and I'll
[2:24:43] sail the white
[2:24:46] SE no more
[2:24:53] The
[2:24:55] Tempest May
[2:24:57] sweep or the
[2:25:01] wild stormy
[2:25:03] deep but in
[2:25:07] Jesus I'm
[2:25:10] saved ever more
[2:25:22] we know that in
[2:25:24] this last leot in age is the age of
[2:25:28] being lukewarm
[2:25:32] and it's easy for all of us to get
[2:25:36] caught up in that Spirit of the age even
[2:25:39] though we know that's the spirit of the
[2:25:41] age even though we've heard the prophet
[2:25:42] say it over and over it's so easy for us
[2:25:45] to start to to slip into it I know that
[2:25:49] that I can be guilty of it allowing
[2:25:50] myself to get laxed to get uh for it to
[2:25:54] be for the word to become common for it
[2:25:57] to not be so special anymore and
[2:26:01] sometimes we just need
[2:26:03] the the minister to come through and
[2:26:06] remind us
[2:26:09] and whether we take that
[2:26:11] as them preaching harsh or whether we
[2:26:14] take that
[2:26:15] as just the Lord reminding us hey we're
[2:26:18] close to time to go home now's not the
[2:26:20] the time to be laxed now is not the time
[2:26:22] to let it be slipping now is not the
[2:26:24] time to let it become
[2:26:27] common we get so busy with the cares of
[2:26:30] the world and we get so busy with
[2:26:32] everything that we have to be doing to
[2:26:36] live in this life that we begin
[2:26:41] to lower the importance of the word in
[2:26:44] our lives because we're busy because
[2:26:48] we're focused on other things
[2:26:51] and that doesn't mean that we're wrapped
[2:26:54] up in sin doesn't mean that we're
[2:26:55] wrapped up in uh in a failure somewhere
[2:26:58] but we come so focused on just living
[2:27:02] life that we begin to to lose sight of
[2:27:06] what our real purpose here
[2:27:09] [Music]
[2:27:11] is you know I think it
[2:27:14] was a good reminder for us each to just
[2:27:17] check our lives and see where we're at
[2:27:19] and
[2:27:21] a reminder to to push aside that that
[2:27:25] lukewarm spirit that that prays on this
[2:27:28] age that is continually going around and
[2:27:31] trying to find that
[2:27:33] chance to help us to to make us be
[2:27:36] distracted to make us be focused on on
[2:27:39] something
[2:27:41] else instead of giving our Focus to our
[2:27:47] Lord and savior instead of giving our
[2:27:48] Focus to the word instead of of giving
[2:27:50] our
[2:27:53] Focus to listening to the prophet or to
[2:27:57] reading the
[2:28:01] message it can be so easy for us
[2:28:05] to either stop listening to the messages
[2:28:09] because we're so busy or even hit the
[2:28:11] point of hey we hit
[2:28:13] play but it's kind of going in the
[2:28:15] background while I'm doing
[2:28:18] whatever that's not to say that
[2:28:21] it's a bad thing you know that's in no
[2:28:22] way saying that it's bad for like the
[2:28:24] sisters to put on a message while
[2:28:25] they're cleaning the house or doing
[2:28:27] whatever great or if the brothers can
[2:28:30] have earbuds at work and listen to a
[2:28:31] message while they're working
[2:28:33] wonderful but we also need to be taking
[2:28:35] that time where we're sitting down and
[2:28:36] we're focused on listening or we're
[2:28:40] focused on reading and we're focused on
[2:28:42] studying that word is not just
[2:28:45] background noise trying to set an
[2:28:46] atmosphere but it's us going into the
[2:28:49] word
[2:28:52] because we're trying to get ready to get
[2:28:54] out of
[2:28:56] here the Lord's trying to make a bride
[2:28:59] ready to make sure that she's dressed
[2:29:02] right and ready for what's on the other
[2:29:04] for what's coming and ready to go to the
[2:29:07] other
[2:29:08] side I thought that
[2:29:12] was a really good message tonight and
[2:29:15] very Timely
[2:29:19] [Applause]
[2:29:23] we do want to continue to remember
[2:29:25] obviously our upcoming
[2:29:27] meetings be in prayer for
[2:29:30] those you know not just for
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:34] um you know be in prayer for what each
[2:29:37] one of us is going to receive um you
[2:29:39] know we pray for that the meetings will
[2:29:41] go well that all those that come will be
[2:29:43] blessed but take time to be selfish for
[2:29:46] a minute think about what are you going
[2:29:47] to get what are you com coming to the
[2:29:50] meetings to receive what are you
[2:29:52] expecting from god let's remember our
[2:29:55] pastor he's traveling back from
[2:29:57] Claremore and remember those that
[2:29:59] weren't able to make it tonight I know
[2:30:01] sister Angie
[2:30:03] uh dogall is uh has an ear infection
[2:30:07] that's flared up again and so she was at
[2:30:09] home with that sister Denise uh had to
[2:30:13] go to the emergency room in in still
[2:30:15] water with uh extreme pain again they've
[2:30:19] admitted her there
[2:30:20] um until she's able to get moved um to I
[2:30:25] believe it's St John's and Tulsa once
[2:30:27] they've got a space there for her the
[2:30:29] doctor in Still Water thinks that she
[2:30:31] still has a blockage that is causing the
[2:30:34] problem so we want to continue to
[2:30:35] remember our sister
[2:30:37] there and just continue to remember each
[2:30:40] other as we go through the week until
[2:30:42] the Lord brings us back to together
