[21:53] Danny steeman he says we want to keep
[21:56] the Saints there in Florida in our

[22:00] they're they're getting roof damage and
[22:02] trees are starting to fall going to be a
[22:06] rough um five to six hours so let's
[22:10] remember him I was talking with brother
[22:12] Joe and they saying that lot of Florida
[22:13] has been evacuated but brother Danny was
[22:16] telling me here tonight that they're in
[22:17] a no evacuation Zone but they're feeling
[22:19] a lot of the effects of it he said the
[22:22] the winds are really strong where he's
[22:24] at right now so let's just remember them
[22:27] in our prayers here tonight if if the

[37:02] thyra write these things saith the Son
[37:05] of God who hath his eyes like unto a
[37:08] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[37:10] brass I Know Thy works and charity and
[37:14] service and faith and thy patience and
[37:17] thy works and the last to be more than
[37:19] the first not with understanding I have
[37:22] a few things against thee because thou
[37:24] sufferest that woman Jezebel which
[37:26] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[37:29] and to seduce my servants to commit
[37:31] fornications and to eat things
[37:33] sacrificed unto
[37:35] idols and I gave her the space to repent
[37:39] of her fornication and she repented not
[37:42] but behold I will cast her into a bed
[37:44] and then that them that commit adultery
[37:46] with her into Great Tribulation except
[37:49] they repent of their deeds and I will

[41:06] seats sister keys if you'll go ahead and
[41:08] put up that first
[41:12] picture so I am one that uh I always
[41:16] like to see you know when we're talking
[41:18] about these uh
[41:21] different different uh cities that are
[41:24] in Asia Minor this is to kind of maybe
[41:27] let everybody get a little bit of a
[41:29] picture of what we're we're talking
[41:30] about um and so here you have the the
[41:34] seven churches that are receiving the
[41:36] letters um you know and if you look um
[41:39] down below where uh Ephesus is listed
[41:43] below the actual word Ephesus if you go
[41:44] down you find the aisle of patmas which
[41:47] is where John was when he was receiving
[41:49] this Revelation and writing this uh
[41:53] writing out this this revelation of
[41:55] Jesus Christ and uh so you have the
[41:57] seven churches that are they are spread
[41:58] across Asia Minor um and obviously we've
[42:01] already talked about uh and gone through
[42:04] several chapters here and so we're going
[42:06] to be beginning with the the theran
[42:09] church age tonight um and so if we want
[42:13] to go ahead and turn to uh page
[42:16] 213 uh in our church age
[42:25] book and we've already read the verses
[42:28] from Revelation so we're going to start
[42:29] down at the
[42:31] bottom thyre now historically the city
[42:35] of thyre was the least noteworthy of all
[42:38] the Seven Cities of the Revelation it
[42:41] was situated on the confines of Mia and
[42:43] Ionia it was surrounded by many rivers
[42:46] but they were full of leeches its most
[42:49] commendable feature was that it was well
[42:51] off financially due to the corporate
[42:53] Guilds of The Potters Tanners Weavers
[42:56] Dyers Rob makers Etc it was from this
[43:00] city that Lydia the seller of purple
[43:02] came she was Paul's first European
[43:05] convert now the reason that Spirit chose
[43:08] this city as the one already containing
[43:10] the spiritual elements for the fourth
[43:12] age was because of its religion the
[43:15] major religion of thyro was the worship
[43:17] of Apollo
[43:19] tyrenos which was joined with the
[43:21] emperor worship cult Apollo was the son
[43:25] God and next in power to his father
[43:27] father Zeus he was known as the averter
[43:29] of evil he presided over religious law
[43:32] and ex experation the means of atonement
[43:36] making amends for wrongdoing or guilt
[43:39] Plato said of him he explains to men the
[43:42] institution of temples sacrifices and
[43:45] services to deities besides rights
[43:48] connected with death and
[43:50] afterlife he communicated his knowledge
[43:52] of the future and his father's will to
[43:55] men through the prophets and Oracle
[43:58] in thyra this ritual was conducted by a
[44:01] propheus who sat on a tripod chair and
[44:03] delivered the messages while
[44:07] entranced we're going to try to move
[44:09] this so that we're not blowing things up
[44:12] quite so much let see if this will work
[44:14] a little bit better over
[44:15] here all
[44:18] right the hold of this religion was
[44:21] remarkable its formidable power did not
[44:23] lie exclusively in the realm of mystery
[44:25] but lay in the fact that no no one could
[44:27] belong to the guilds which offered the
[44:29] people their living unless they belong
[44:31] to the temple worship of Apollo anyone
[44:34] who refused to join in the idolatrous
[44:36] feasts and lucidious orgis were barred
[44:39] from those first century unions in order
[44:42] to be a part of the social and
[44:44] Commercial life one had to be a
[44:46] practicing Pagan
[44:49] idolator it is most most worthy of note
[44:51] that the very name thyra means
[44:53] dominating female thus this age is
[44:56] characterized by a dominant force a
[44:59] force that ruthlessly invades all
[45:01] conquers all and despotically controls
[45:04] now dominating female is the greatest
[45:06] curse in the world the wisest man the
[45:08] world ever saw was Solomon and he said I
[45:11] applied my heart to know and to search
[45:13] and to seek out wisdom and the reason of
[45:16] things and to know the wickedness of
[45:18] folly even of foolishness and Madness
[45:21] and I find more bitter than death the
[45:23] woman whose heart is snares and Nets and
[45:26] her hands is bands who so pleaseth God
[45:29] shall escape from her but the Sinners
[45:31] shall be taken by her behold this I have
[45:33] found saith the preacher counting one by
[45:36] one to find out the account which yet my
[45:39] soul seeketh but I find not one man
[45:42] amongst a thousand have I found but a
[45:44] woman amongst all those have I not found
[45:47] Ecclesiastes 7:
[45:50] 25-28 Paul said I suffer not a woman to
[45:52] teach or to usurp Authority from the
[45:55] Garden of Eden onward woman has
[45:58] constantly and successfully tried to
[45:59] take control over the man and right
[46:02] today it is the Woman's World with the
[46:04] goddess of America being a naked female
[46:07] as the female Idol falling out of the
[46:09] Skies remember her arms were iron bars
[46:12] characterized the first or Ephesian age
[46:14] so her power has grown until she gained
[46:17] absolute Authority such Authority being
[46:19] usurped by her iron
[46:22] disposition now a woman is not meant to
[46:24] have an iron disposition she is
[46:27] according to the Holy scripture to be
[46:28] submissive to the male that is commanded
[46:31] of her woman who is truly female all
[46:34] female will be of that disposition not a
[46:36] doormat no real male makes a female a
[46:38] doormat but she will want to be under
[46:40] Authority and not rule over the male for
[46:43] he is the head of the house if she
[46:45] breaks that image that God made for her
[46:47] she is perverted any male that lets the
[46:49] woman take authority has also broken
[46:52] that image and he is
[46:53] perverted that is why a
[46:55] woman cannot wear that which pertaineth
[46:58] to a man or cut her hair she is never to
[47:01] wear garments that pertain to a male or
[47:03] cut her hair when she does see is
[47:06] intruding into that male domain taking
[47:08] Authority and perverting herself and
[47:10] when a woman invades the pulpit which is
[47:12] commanded she must not do she shows what
[47:14] Spirit she is of being a dominating
[47:17] female is Antichrist and the seeds of
[47:20] the Roman Catholic Church are in her
[47:22] though she may Des deny this ever so V
[47:25] vehemently but when it comes to the word
[47:27] let God be true and every man's word a
[47:30] lie
[47:32] amen let us go back to the beginning in
[47:35] the original physical creation we know
[47:37] it today God made everything in pairs
[47:39] male and female there were two chickens
[47:42] R rooster and hen there were two cattle
[47:45] the cow and the bull and right down the
[47:47] line but when it came to man there was
[47:50] only one there were not a pair Adam had
[47:53] been made in the image of God he was the
[47:56] son of God as a Son of God he could not
[47:58] be tempted and fall that would be
[48:00] impossible so God took a byproduct of
[48:03] man to cause the fall man never stepped
[48:06] fresh from woman never stepped fresh
[48:08] from the hand of God as a true product
[48:10] of God she was produced from man and
[48:12] when God caused her to be brought forth
[48:14] from man she was vastly different from
[48:16] other females he had created she was
[48:19] able to be seduced no other female in
[48:22] cre creation can be immoral but the
[48:24] human female may be touched at almost
[48:25] any time and that weakness in her
[48:28] allowed Satan to seduce her by the way
[48:29] of The Serpent and has brought the woman
[48:32] to a very peculiar position before God
[48:34] in his word she is the type of all
[48:36] things vulgar foul and loathsome on the
[48:39] one hand and on the other hand she is
[48:41] the type of all things clean and
[48:42] beautiful and holy is the receptable of
[48:45] the spirit and blessing of God on the
[48:48] one hand she is called the who is
[48:49] drunk with the wine of her fornications
[48:52] on the other she is called the bride of
[48:53] Christ on one hand she is called mystery
[48:56] baby
[48:57] the Abomination before God and on the
[48:59] other hand she is called New Jerusalem
[49:01] our mother on the one hand she is so
[49:04] foul and wicked and lewd that she
[49:06] summarily cast into the Lake of Fire as
[49:08] the only fit place for her and on the
[49:11] other hand she ex exalted to Heaven
[49:13] sharing the very Throne of God as the
[49:15] only place befitting such a
[49:19] queen now I want to go back um you know
[49:22] we're going to kind of tie into some
[49:25] things that we've read already in here a
[49:27] while back so let's go back to page 69
[49:29] back in the Ephesian Church age you know
[49:31] brother Wendell has been bringing out
[49:32] and pointing out throughout this how you
[49:36] have the two Vines you have the two
[49:39] trees you have the two churches that are
[49:40] continually growing up together and then
[49:43] you see the same type as he's going into
[49:45] this with uh the women that you've got
[49:48] the two types you have and he's bringing
[49:50] this out and in the tharian age pointing
[49:53] out you can have the most holy the most
[49:57] beautiful and you can have the most
[49:59] wicked the most lewd the most
[50:02] despicable both at the same time going
[50:05] on so as we go back to page 69 uh we're
[50:08] going to start about halfway down the
[50:14] page now let us be very careful that we
[50:16] are not confused at this point thus we
[50:18] will seek the word to validate this
[50:20] claim let us go back to the book of the
[50:22] beginnings Genesis in the Garden of Eden
[50:25] there were two trees one was good one
[50:28] was evil one produced life the other
[50:31] produced death there were two children
[50:33] who originally offered sacrifices to God
[50:36] let me repeat that they both offered
[50:38] sacrifices to
[50:40] God and in the process of time it came
[50:42] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[50:44] of the ground an offering unto the Lord
[50:46] and Abel he also brought of the
[50:47] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[50:49] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[50:51] Abel unto his offering but unto Cain and
[50:54] his offering he had not respect but one
[50:56] one Cain was evil being of his father
[50:59] that Wicked one while Abel was righteous
[51:01] before the Lord again there were two
[51:03] children from the Flesh of the same
[51:05] parents they were the twins of Isaac and
[51:09] Rebecca excuse me one was the elect of
[51:12] God and the other was reprobate both
[51:14] worshiped God in every single case there
[51:17] was worship of God involved in every
[51:20] case the evil hated the righteous and
[51:22] persecuted the righteous in some cases
[51:25] the evil destroyed the right but notice
[51:27] they were planted together they lived
[51:30] together they both made claims upon God
[51:32] and worshiped God these illustrations
[51:35] depict perfectly the parable of the Lord
[51:37] Jesus Christ when he said the kingdom of
[51:39] heaven was like unto a man who sowed
[51:41] good seed only to have an enemy come and
[51:43] plant tears amongst those good seeds God
[51:46] did not plant the tears Satan planted
[51:48] those tears right amongst the good seed
[51:50] of God those two kinds of plants people
[51:53] from two different seeds grew up
[51:55] together they partook of the nourishment
[51:57] in the same Earth they shared in the
[52:00] same Sun rain and all the other benefits
[52:02] and both were harvested in their turn do
[52:04] you see it don't ever forget these
[52:06] truths as we study the church ages and
[52:08] later the seals and above all don't
[52:10] forget that is in this last age when the
[52:12] tears are getting Bound for their
[52:13] burning that they will shove out the
[52:15] wheat that is to be garnered by the
[52:19] Lord I want to carry this thought all
[52:22] the way through so let us go a step
[52:23] further have you ever studied the
[52:25] history of revivals now a Revival
[52:27] signifies a move of God in power and
[52:30] every time God moves Satan is there to
[52:32] move also it never fails in the days of
[52:34] the great Welsh Revival and most people
[52:36] don't know this the insane asylums
[52:38] filled up quickly and it was a great
[52:40] display of devil power to take away the
[52:42] attention from God it is written that in
[52:44] Wesley's days that people would do most
[52:47] peculiar things that were definitely of
[52:48] Satan to try to mock the goodness and
[52:50] power of God in Luther's day it is said
[52:53] that the miracle of his ministry did not
[52:54] lie in the fact that he successfully
[52:56] protested the Roman Catholic church but
[52:58] the miracle lay in the fact that he
[53:00] could and did stay sound and sane amidst
[53:02] the Fanatics who are often filled with
[53:04] and guided by wrong spirits and if
[53:06] you've been aware of this last day
[53:08] Ministry you will have noted the same
[53:10] invasion of false and wicked Spirits it
[53:12] has to be that way now I hope and trust
[53:15] you are spiritual mind enough to get
[53:16] that and capitalize it just to seal this
[53:20] point on the true and false Vines
[53:22] mingling and demonstrating the two
[53:23] spirits that are at work let us look in
[53:26] 1 John 4: 1-4 and Jude
[53:30] 3412 beloved believe not every Spirit
[53:33] but try the spirits whether they are of
[53:35] God because many false prophets are gone
[53:37] out into the world hereby know ye the
[53:39] spirit of God every spirit that
[53:41] confesseth that Jesus Christ Has Come In
[53:43] the Flesh of God and every spirit that
[53:45] confesseth not that Jesus Christ has
[53:47] come in the flesh is not of God and this
[53:50] is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye
[53:52] have heard that it should come and even
[53:54] now already is in the world year of God
[53:57] little children and have overcome them
[54:00] the Antichrist spirit because greater is
[54:03] he God's spirit that is in you than he
[54:05] that is in the
[54:08] world Jude 34:12 behold when I gave all
[54:11] diligence to write unto you of the
[54:12] common salvation it was needful for me
[54:15] to write unto you and exhort you that
[54:16] you should earnestly contend for the
[54:18] faith which was once delivered unto the
[54:20] Saints but there are certain men not
[54:23] Saints crept in unawares these have not
[54:26] come into the fold by means of the door
[54:28] and are therefore robbers who were
[54:30] before of old ordained to this
[54:33] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[54:35] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[54:37] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[54:40] Jesus Christ these are spots in your
[54:43] feasts of Charity when they Feast with
[54:44] you feeding themselves without fear it
[54:47] cannot to be denied in the face of these
[54:49] scriptures that the true church and the
[54:51] false church are intertwined having been
[54:54] planted together but of different
[54:57] seed let's move forward to page 85 still
[55:02] in the Ephesian Church age and about
[55:04] 2third of the way down the page on page
[55:09] 85 did you get it now those are those
[55:13] twins again there are those two trees
[55:15] again growing side by side in the same
[55:17] Earth partaking of the same nourishment
[55:20] drinking in the same rain and benefiting
[55:22] by the same Sun but they come from
[55:24] different seeds one tree is for the word
[55:26] of God exactly as God gave it and loves
[55:29] and obeys it the other tree is from the
[55:31] seed that is anti the word of God and
[55:33] changes it where it all it wants
[55:36] to it substitutes its own Creeds and
[55:38] dogmas for the living true word exactly
[55:41] as did Cain who ended up killing Abel
[55:43] but fear not little flock stay with the
[55:46] word keep that word between you and the
[55:48] devil Eve did not do that and she failed
[55:51] and when the church lets down on the
[55:52] word she goes into the depths of the
[55:55] darkness of Satan
[55:58] and so here you have this setting
[56:00] between the two different women the two
[56:03] different churches you have the evil and
[56:05] you have the
[56:08] good couple more quotes that I want to
[56:11] read these are out of marriage and
[56:16] divorce now what a difference in this
[56:18] day in this day of conception instead of
[56:20] him being her ruler she became his God
[56:23] sure she rules him now you can probably
[56:25] well understand what I've been hitting
[56:27] at by her beauty and her sex control her
[56:29] shape that was given to her by Satan the
[56:32] byproduct that Satan did she is sent to
[56:34] deceive the sons of God and she can sway
[56:36] more of them to Hell than any other
[56:38] instrument Satan has got that's exactly
[56:40] right I'm talking of the immoral now not
[56:43] you
[56:45] sisters we'll give you your place right
[56:48] place in a few minutes in the word of
[56:49] God it was in God's plan from the
[56:52] beginning now to do this today what is
[56:54] the god of the United States you
[56:56] remember remember in the Tabernacle
[56:57] years ago I preached on that the God of
[56:59] this modern day a little flapper sitting
[57:00] there with makeup on and dress pulled up
[57:02] over knees and things like that I said
[57:04] behold your God and that's
[57:06] right she is on every advertisement half
[57:09] naked she is on the street the same way
[57:12] it's an instrument of Satan from the
[57:14] beginning Jesus said we see that it is
[57:16] so now and from the beginning and what
[57:18] he's talking about now the heathens used
[57:21] to make her a god did you know that a
[57:23] goddess sure did they made her a goddess
[57:25] for they did have sex acts in their
[57:28] worship they claimed that she was the
[57:29] creator in her womb she carried the seed
[57:31] and created that's a lie there's only
[57:33] one Creator that's God do you remember
[57:36] Paul there Diana of Ephesus an image of
[57:38] grock said the goddess of Heaven throwed
[57:40] down don't you see how Heathen worship
[57:42] is and we not knowing it turn right
[57:45] straight back to Heathen worship again
[57:47] to women the very lowest creature on the
[57:49] earth woman worship she will sway man
[57:51] any way she wants to and not knowing all
[57:54] that beauty on the outside that is on
[57:56] the inside Solomon said her Gates is the
[57:59] gates to hell now we see plainly there
[58:01] what Jesus spoke of in Revelation the 2
[58:04] chapter and the 15 verse of the nickan
[58:06] doctrine the oncoming of that church
[58:08] pulling itself away from the word and
[58:10] also we see here plainly these vulgar
[58:13] ungodly filthy programs that we have on
[58:15] television of Hollywood sex Queens we
[58:17] can see the filth of this city as these
[58:19] kids little old girls walking up and
[58:21] down the street here with little bitty
[58:22] tight clothes twisting around it's cold
[58:24] enough to freeze them to death they
[58:26] don't know that's the devil doing that
[58:28] they are possessed of an evil spirit and
[58:30] don't know
[58:32] it and then dropping
[58:34] down he went right on revealing his word
[58:37] to the body and vindicating him Same by
[58:39] himself his children began to kind of
[58:41] look more like him because it's fully
[58:43] maturing or they become children of the
[58:45] word not children of the church Children
[58:47] of the word and the bride will be a
[58:50] lovely little lady of the word
[58:51] unadulterated not touched by any man's
[58:53] organization any man-made the theory
[58:56] she'll be purely unadulterated Bride of
[58:58] the word amen and amen I hope that you
[59:01] get that on the air she will be the
[59:03] pregnated daughter of God see what a
[59:05] great honor a woman can be see what a
[59:07] great thing the church can be but you
[59:09] see where filth has got her to then
[59:11] trying to compare that church out there
[59:12] with the church here you can't do it and
[59:15] try to compare the street Harlot with
[59:16] the Church of the Living God or the
[59:19] woman the correct woman with a harlot
[59:21] why is there such a thing as that it's
[59:23] the law of God the law of contrast how
[59:26] how will we know how to enjoy daylight
[59:27] if there wasn't a night how will we know
[59:29] how to enjoy the dry weather if there
[59:31] wasn't rain how would we know to enjoy
[59:33] and respect a real woman if there wasn't
[59:36] a dirty
[59:37] one and then dropping down just to
[59:40] finish this thought out
[59:42] and uh in marriage and divorce brother
[59:45] brandom continues says notice now the
[59:47] woman has got her place and she is a
[59:49] jewel Solomon this man that had 10,000
[59:52] wives or had a thousand wives rather he
[59:54] said a man that's found a wife has found
[59:56] found a good thing a good woman is a
[59:58] jewel in his crown that's an honor but
[1:00:00] an unrighteous one is water in his blood
[1:00:03] that's his life he said there might be
[1:00:05] one righteous man found in a thousand
[1:00:07] Solomon said said you wouldn't find one
[1:00:09] righteous woman in a thousand Solomon
[1:00:11] said that you see now notice that how it
[1:00:13] is but you see woman you are a jewel if
[1:00:16] you want to be a jewel but the desire
[1:00:18] has to be by you
[1:00:29] and so like brother Brandon was laying
[1:00:30] out you have on the one
[1:00:33] hand the woman can be so foul and wicked
[1:00:37] and lewd that she would be summarily
[1:00:39] cast into the Lake of Fire as the only
[1:00:42] fit place for
[1:00:44] her but on the other
[1:00:46] hand we have our sisters we have the
[1:00:49] bride standing forth that is exalted to
[1:00:52] Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as
[1:00:55] the only Place befitting such a queen as
[1:00:59] brother brandham it's the law said it's
[1:01:00] the law of contrast you have the light
[1:01:02] versus the dark and here we're seeing
[1:01:04] the True Vine and the false Vine the
[1:01:05] true church and the false Church the
[1:01:07] true godly woman and that
[1:01:15] Jezebel going back to page
[1:01:22] 216 halfway down the page was where we
[1:01:26] left off and just continuing in and in
[1:01:28] this thotran church age she is a
[1:01:30] dominating female she is Mystery babyon
[1:01:33] she is the great she is Jezebel
[1:01:35] the false propheus why because the true
[1:01:38] female is submissive to God Christ is
[1:01:40] her head she has no word but his no
[1:01:43] thoughts but his no leadership but his
[1:01:46] but what about this church she has cast
[1:01:48] out the word destroyed the Bibles and
[1:01:50] worthy essays of The Godly she has slain
[1:01:53] those who had preach the truth she has
[1:01:54] taken over Kings princes and Nations
[1:01:57] controls armies and insists that she is
[1:01:59] the True Body of Christ and that her
[1:02:02] Popes are the Vicor of Christ she is
[1:02:04] entirely seduced by the devil until she
[1:02:06] is in turn become the Seducer of others
[1:02:09] she is the Bride of Satan has produced
[1:02:11] his bastard child
[1:02:14] religions all through the Dark Ages she
[1:02:16] has dominated for over 900 years she
[1:02:19] plundered and destroyed she killed the
[1:02:21] Arts destroyed the Sciences produced
[1:02:24] nothing but death until the light of
[1:02:25] truth was almost entirely gone and only
[1:02:28] the beest sliver of light remained the
[1:02:31] oil in the wide had almost ceased to
[1:02:33] flow but though she dominated the world
[1:02:35] kingdoms and demanded that all men find
[1:02:37] their citizenship in her there was a
[1:02:39] little group who belonged to God and
[1:02:41] their citizenship was in heaven and then
[1:02:44] them she could not destroy God kept his
[1:02:47] little flock they would not be destroyed
[1:02:49] this Church of Rome was as Heathen and
[1:02:51] wicked as Queen aalia who tried to
[1:02:53] destroy all the Royal seed and almost
[1:02:56] succeeded but God preserved one and of
[1:02:59] him there came more of the faithful so
[1:03:02] God preserved a little flock in that
[1:03:03] long dark night and of their truth there
[1:03:06] finally arose a Luther anyone who knows
[1:03:09] anything at all about the Roman Catholic
[1:03:10] church and its form of worship can tell
[1:03:13] why this city of thoyre was chosen by
[1:03:15] the spirit to represent the church in
[1:03:17] the Dark Age there it is right before
[1:03:20] our eyes the thot tyan age lasted the
[1:03:24] longest of them all about 900 years from
[1:03:27] 606 to
[1:03:31] 1520 so thyra brother random said was
[1:03:35] the city
[1:03:36] that in a lot of ways was least of all
[1:03:38] the cities that are listed out as the
[1:03:41] church ages but yet one thing it had was
[1:03:45] that it had much wealth because it had
[1:03:50] the it was able to produce the the the
[1:03:52] purple goods and had all kinds of guilds
[1:03:54] and things
[1:03:56] but yet they took all of
[1:03:59] this production all of this being
[1:04:02] involved in uh in in in work and being
[1:04:06] able to actually make money and provide
[1:04:08] and they tied all that back into the
[1:04:10] religion of the
[1:04:12] day you were only able to be a part of
[1:04:14] the guild if you were a practicing
[1:04:17] member of the church if you were willing
[1:04:19] to go and participate in the feast if
[1:04:21] you were willing to go and worship
[1:04:23] Apollo and do these different things
[1:04:25] otherwise
[1:04:26] you couldn't be part of it you would be
[1:04:30] left out you wouldn't be able to
[1:04:31] participate you wouldn't be able to
[1:04:33] provide for your family you wouldn't be
[1:04:35] able to earn a living you wouldn't be
[1:04:38] able to do any of these things because
[1:04:40] you were
[1:04:41] not worshiping them you were not
[1:04:44] worshiping Apollo you were not part of
[1:04:46] that church and so you were fully cut
[1:04:49] out you know you see when they talk
[1:04:52] about that you'll need a mark to be able
[1:04:54] to set
[1:04:56] when we look at the prophecies later on
[1:04:58] in Revelation you can see the same thing
[1:05:00] actually being
[1:05:02] practiced in this time that you had to
[1:05:05] have the mark you had to be part of the
[1:05:08] church you had to be part of this
[1:05:11] apostate Church worshiping the way they
[1:05:14] wanted you to worship willing to give
[1:05:17] up all
[1:05:19] truth if you wanted to be able to
[1:05:21] provide if you wanted to be part of
[1:05:23] society if you wanted to be part of
[1:05:25] everything going
[1:05:30] around this was the darkest age and as
[1:05:33] you look at this city you can see it
[1:05:35] where there would be almost no light how
[1:05:36] would you provide for your family if you
[1:05:38] wanted to if you were a believer in this
[1:05:42] town obviously we know that God can
[1:05:44] provide but this wasn't going to be an
[1:05:46] easy path this wasn't going to be a way
[1:05:48] that you could I can go out and I can
[1:05:50] know I can make plenty of money and
[1:05:52] provide for my family no it would be a
[1:05:55] I'm scraping every single day to try to
[1:05:57] get
[1:05:59] enough to feed myself to feed my family
[1:06:02] to do whatever because I'm not a part of
[1:06:05] it I'm not doing everything they want
[1:06:09] and so because that I'm not part of the
[1:06:11] guilds I'm not part of any of the
[1:06:12] organizations I'm cut off I'm separate
[1:06:16] and then that began to manifest through
[1:06:17] the age as the Catholic Church took on
[1:06:20] more and more power through the age
[1:06:21] itself to where if you weren't part of
[1:06:24] the Catholic Church
[1:06:26] you weren't able to do that
[1:06:29] much you were cut off you would be
[1:06:32] hunted down you would be held up and put
[1:06:36] Through Torture and all these different
[1:06:37] things to try to get you to convert to
[1:06:39] what they said was the only way and the
[1:06:43] only
[1:06:50] truth continuing into the messenger
[1:06:55] now the church had long been split into
[1:06:57] two groups Western and
[1:07:00] Eastern every now and then a reformer
[1:07:02] would arise and either or both divisions
[1:07:05] and for a while lead some segment of the
[1:07:07] church into a deeper relationship with
[1:07:08] God such a man in the west was Francis
[1:07:12] of
[1:07:12] aisi truly successful time his work was
[1:07:15] finally put under by the hierarchy of
[1:07:18] Rome now Francis of aisi started the
[1:07:23] what are now known as The Franciscan
[1:07:24] monks
[1:07:26] they would basically lay aside claim all
[1:07:29] claim to any type of worldly wealth all
[1:07:32] they cared
[1:07:33] about was preaching the
[1:07:36] gospel they went the opposite when you
[1:07:38] looked at the Catholic Church as a whole
[1:07:40] they were all about getting more money
[1:07:43] get more money get more money and
[1:07:44] Francis of aisu came in and he said no
[1:07:48] that doesn't matter we'll lay aside
[1:07:49] everything we will live the bare minimum
[1:07:53] that we can okay and for a time as
[1:07:57] brother brandham said they were able to
[1:07:58] do some good works they were able to
[1:08:00] begin to to sway in some way but
[1:08:04] eventually even that was swallowed back
[1:08:06] up by the Catholic
[1:08:09] church now Peter Waldo of lions a
[1:08:11] merchant who renounced his secular life
[1:08:14] became very active in serving the lord
[1:08:15] and Drew many unto him but he was
[1:08:18] thwarted in his work and excommunicated
[1:08:20] by the
[1:08:21] pope neither the western or the Eastern
[1:08:24] group had within them a man who could
[1:08:26] possibly be the messenger to this age
[1:08:28] when examined in the light of
[1:08:30] scriptures however there were two men in
[1:08:32] the British Isles whose Ministry and
[1:08:34] word and deed could stand the test of
[1:08:36] Truth they were St Patrick and St
[1:08:39] Columba it was to St Columba that the
[1:08:42] lot of being the messenger
[1:08:44] fell now though the messenger to the
[1:08:47] thot tyan age was St Columba I want to
[1:08:49] dwell a little on the life of St Patrick
[1:08:51] as an example to us and also to give the
[1:08:54] LIE to Rome's claim that St Patrick was
[1:08:57] any more one of her than was Joan of
[1:09:01] Arc sister keys if you'll put up picture
[1:09:05] to and you can just leave that up while
[1:09:07] we're talking about St
[1:09:09] Patrick now Patrick was
[1:09:14] born to the sister of St Martin in the
[1:09:16] little town of bonver on the banks of
[1:09:19] the river Clyde one day while playing on
[1:09:21] the shoreline with his two sisters
[1:09:23] Pirates approached and kidnapped all
[1:09:24] three
[1:09:26] where the sisters went no one knows but
[1:09:28] Patrick whose name was suck at was sold
[1:09:32] to a chieftain in Northern irand his
[1:09:34] duty was to tend the swine to do this he
[1:09:37] trained dogs so well trained were his
[1:09:40] dogs that many people came from far and
[1:09:42] near to buy them in his loneliness he
[1:09:44] turned to God and was saved then came
[1:09:47] the Urgent desire to escape and return
[1:09:49] home to his parents he formed a plan
[1:09:52] that put his ability as a trainer to
[1:09:54] Great use he taught the dogs to lie on
[1:09:57] him and cover his body carefully and not
[1:09:59] move until
[1:10:00] commanded thus one day when his owner
[1:10:02] sold several dogs Patrick commanded the
[1:10:05] dogs except the leader of the pack to
[1:10:07] get into the boat the leader of pack to
[1:10:10] which he then gave a secret signal ran
[1:10:12] off and refused to come aboard while the
[1:10:14] master and the buyer attempted to get
[1:10:16] the dog Patrick got onto the into the
[1:10:18] boat and Signal the dogs to cover him
[1:10:21] then with a whistle he brought the
[1:10:22] leader of the pack into the boat and on
[1:10:24] top of him
[1:10:26] since Patrick was nowhere to be seen the
[1:10:28] buyer put up sail and moved out to
[1:10:30] sea after making sure that the captain
[1:10:33] was too far out to turn back Patrick
[1:10:35] gave another signal to the dogs which
[1:10:37] caused them to Riot then he came forth
[1:10:39] and told the captain that unless he
[1:10:40] would put him ashore at his home he
[1:10:42] would command the dogs to keep riding
[1:10:44] and he would take over the
[1:10:46] ship however the captain was a Christian
[1:10:48] and when he heard the boy's story he
[1:10:50] gladly put him ashore at his home there
[1:10:53] Patrick went to Bible school and
[1:10:55] returned to Ireland where by the word
[1:10:56] and the power of God and many signs and
[1:10:58] wonders he won thousands to the Lord in
[1:11:01] no time did he ever go to Rome nor at
[1:11:04] any time was he commissioned by Rome the
[1:11:06] truth of the matter is that when Rome
[1:11:07] finally gained foothold on the island
[1:11:09] and when they saw the time was opportune
[1:11:11] they killed over a 100,000 Christians
[1:11:13] who had over the years grown out of the
[1:11:15] original group that had come to the Lord
[1:11:17] under St
[1:11:19] Patrick now this painting that's here is
[1:11:23] called the legend of St Patrick and you
[1:11:27] can go through and find all kinds of
[1:11:31] Miracles that happened during St
[1:11:33] Patrick's Ministry but this painting
[1:11:36] references one that you can either take
[1:11:38] it as it just being a legend or whether
[1:11:41] it actually happened but after Patrick
[1:11:44] had come and this was during the time
[1:11:46] when there was not a singular King that
[1:11:48] was over all of Ireland it was different
[1:11:51] uh smaller kings that ruled over their
[1:11:54] their tribes or they were The Chieftains
[1:11:56] of certain areas and so he was there
[1:11:59] working to convert the people working to
[1:12:01] convert this King and there were many
[1:12:03] Druids that were in that area and this
[1:12:05] one king had his Druids that served
[1:12:09] him and after quite some time of just
[1:12:13] observing Patrick and seeing how he
[1:12:16] acted the King was finally invited him
[1:12:19] to come and speak to
[1:12:20] him now The Druids were so upset and so
[1:12:25] ticked
[1:12:27] off because they were concerned that if
[1:12:29] Patrick actually got through to the king
[1:12:32] that he would be
[1:12:33] converted and so once they knew that
[1:12:36] Patrick was supposed to be coming to
[1:12:37] speak to the king they went and they
[1:12:39] sent set an ambush for him they gathered
[1:12:42] the soldiers and warriors that they
[1:12:44] could and they waited along the path
[1:12:46] that led to uh the stade or Castle or
[1:12:50] whatever you would call it so that way
[1:12:52] they could kill Patrick and and his
[1:12:56] fellow brothers in Christ that were with
[1:12:59] him now they were there
[1:13:02] waiting and before Patrick and the rest
[1:13:05] of his group had left they had prayed
[1:13:07] for protection that the Lord would watch
[1:13:09] over them and they went walking along to
[1:13:12] reach the the king to be able to speak
[1:13:14] to him and here's this Ambush and
[1:13:17] wait and as they come through the Ambush
[1:13:22] never sees them but what they see is
[1:13:25] they see a herd of deer walk across the
[1:13:29] clearing they never see a man they never
[1:13:32] see a person all they see are this herd
[1:13:34] of deer walk
[1:13:38] by and Patrick and his group
[1:13:40] successfully go by and reach the king
[1:13:43] and they're able to minister to him and
[1:13:46] they're able to actually convert him to
[1:13:48] Christ now like I said whether this is
[1:13:51] just purely a legend or whether this is
[1:13:54] Poss possibly just a miracle of
[1:13:58] God I'll let you decide that on your
[1:14:01] own but we know that God can blind the
[1:14:04] eyes and we know that God can open the
[1:14:06] eyes and so I don't see any reason why
[1:14:08] God couldn't do something like that but
[1:14:12] either way Patrick was a mighty man of
[1:14:14] God
[1:14:15] that did his best to lead the people to
[1:14:23] Christ now if you'll go on to the next
[1:14:26] picture sister
[1:14:29] Keys continuing at the bottom of page
[1:14:32] 218 about 60 years after the death of St
[1:14:36] Patrick Columba was born in County donle
[1:14:39] North Island to the royal family of
[1:14:46] Fergus I'm going to pause here just for
[1:14:48] a
[1:14:50] moment so Patrick came back to
[1:14:54] lead Ireland to Christ to witness to
[1:14:57] them and then Columba is born to the
[1:15:01] royal family of
[1:15:03] Ireland after Patrick has come and
[1:15:07] testified and led them away from the
[1:15:10] Druid
[1:15:11] worship to
[1:15:13] Christianity so though we know that
[1:15:15] Patrick wasn't the messenger to the age
[1:15:19] at the same time you can probably say he
[1:15:20] had an impact on that messenger coming
[1:15:24] because he brought the message he was
[1:15:26] the one sent to bring the message to
[1:15:27] Ireland that's right and then out of
[1:15:30] that you have the messenger come
[1:15:35] forward he became a brilliant
[1:15:37] consecrated scholar committing to memory
[1:15:39] most of the
[1:15:41] scripture God called him in an audible
[1:15:43] voice to be a missionary after he had
[1:15:45] heard the voice of God nothing could
[1:15:47] stop him and his miraculous Ministry has
[1:15:49] caused many historians to Acclaim him
[1:15:52] next to the apostles so great was his
[1:15:55] Ministry with the supernatural signs
[1:15:57] following that some especially students
[1:16:00] in Rome have thought the accounts were
[1:16:03] exaggerated in one of his missionary
[1:16:05] Journeys he approached a walled City he
[1:16:07] found the gates barred against him he
[1:16:09] lifted his voice in prayer that God
[1:16:11] might intervene and allow him access to
[1:16:13] the people in order to
[1:16:14] preach but as he prayed the court
[1:16:16] magicians began to harass him with loud
[1:16:20] noises he then began to sing a Psalm as
[1:16:23] he sang God so in greas the the volume
[1:16:25] of his voices that he drowned out the
[1:16:26] cries of the Heathen suddenly the gates
[1:16:29] burst open of their own accord he
[1:16:31] entered in and preached the gospel
[1:16:33] winning many to the Lord on another
[1:16:36] occasion when he was also shut out from
[1:16:38] a village as he turned to waited apart
[1:16:40] the sun of the chief suddenly became
[1:16:42] violently ill even unto death St Columbo
[1:16:46] was quickly sought after and recalled
[1:16:48] when he prayed the prayer of faith the
[1:16:50] boy was instantly
[1:16:51] healed The Village was then open to
[1:16:54] evangelization by the
[1:16:56] gospel the pure gospel that was preached
[1:16:58] by Columba and his fellow workers spread
[1:17:00] over the whole of Scotland turning it to
[1:17:03] God it also overflowed into Ireland and
[1:17:05] over northern Europe his means of
[1:17:08] spreading the gospel was one wherein
[1:17:10] perhaps 12 men under a leader would go
[1:17:11] into a new area and literally literally
[1:17:14] build a gospel centered Town amongst
[1:17:17] these 12 men would be Carpenters
[1:17:18] teachers preachers Etc all wonderfully
[1:17:20] versed in the word and holy living this
[1:17:23] little colony was enclosed by wall soon
[1:17:26] this enclosure would be surrounded by
[1:17:27] students and their families in their own
[1:17:29] homes learning the word and preparing to
[1:17:32] go out and serve the Lord as
[1:17:33] missionaries leaders and preachers the
[1:17:36] men were free to marry though many did
[1:17:38] not in order to serve God better they
[1:17:40] remained free from State help and
[1:17:42] thereby steered clear of
[1:17:44] politics instead of ever attacking other
[1:17:47] religions they taught the truth for they
[1:17:49] believed that the truth was weapon
[1:17:51] enough to accomplish the ends that God
[1:17:53] had in mind for them they were
[1:17:55] absolutely independent of
[1:17:57] Rome St Columbo was the founder of a
[1:18:00] great Bible school on the island of high
[1:18:02] off the Southwest coast of Scotland when
[1:18:04] he went there the islands was so Barren
[1:18:06] and Rocky that could not bear enough
[1:18:07] food for them all but Columba planted
[1:18:10] seed with one hand while he held the
[1:18:11] other a loft in prayer today the island
[1:18:14] is one of the most fertile in the world
[1:18:16] from this Bible centered Island went
[1:18:18] forth Mighty Scholars endowed with
[1:18:20] wisdom and the power of
[1:18:21] God when I read the history of this
[1:18:24] great servant of God and the wonderful
[1:18:26] work he did it saddened my heart to find
[1:18:29] the papal power lusting to bring all men
[1:18:31] into its grasp came and eventually
[1:18:33] defiled those Mission fields and
[1:18:35] destroyed the truth as it was taught by
[1:18:39] Columba as brother bam has laid out in
[1:18:43] other chapters we're going through here
[1:18:45] Columbus stayed out of politics he
[1:18:48] stayed out of anything that would be
[1:18:51] formalized and he just taught the truth
[1:18:55] he just taught the word and left it at
[1:18:57] that he didn't need to
[1:18:59] attack The Druids or attack any other
[1:19:01] religion all he did was teach the truth
[1:19:03] because that was weapon enough that's
[1:19:05] right I don't need to go out and point
[1:19:07] out their mistakes if I'm just teaching
[1:19:09] the truth I don't need to go out and
[1:19:10] point out where they're wrong or what
[1:19:11] they've done as long as I keep preaching
[1:19:13] the truth and keep bringing that out
[1:19:15] that's all that we need and the rest is
[1:19:17] up to the Lord to take care of
[1:19:26] you can go ahead and take that down
[1:19:30] toes now as we go into the
[1:19:34] salutation Revelations 2 and verse 18
[1:19:38] these things saith the Son of God who
[1:19:41] have his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[1:19:43] and his feet are like fine
[1:19:46] brass the revelation of godhead to the
[1:19:48] thyon age is that Jesus is the son of
[1:19:51] God once in the days of his flesh he was
[1:19:54] known known as the son of man but
[1:19:56] henceforth we know him no more after the
[1:19:58] flesh he is no longer the son of man the
[1:20:00] great prophet who in himself gathered
[1:20:02] together all prophecies the only
[1:20:04] begotten is back to the bosom of the
[1:20:06] father now we know him after the power
[1:20:09] of the Resurrection he is risen and has
[1:20:11] taken unto himself his mighty power and
[1:20:13] is above all and overall to the praise
[1:20:15] of his own Glory his glory will he not
[1:20:18] share with another his leadership over
[1:20:20] the church he will not surrender to any
[1:20:23] man he looks down upon thyra and here he
[1:20:26] sees in that City in that fourth age the
[1:20:29] honor of which belongs to him alone
[1:20:31] bestowed upon another his eyes Blaze
[1:20:34] with the fire of Wrath and judgment as
[1:20:35] he sees Apollo revered as the Son of God
[1:20:39] when he alone is the only begotten of
[1:20:41] the father how awful must his judgment
[1:20:44] be upon the religion of the thyon age
[1:20:46] wherein the church members like Pagan
[1:20:48] worshippers of the Son of God Apollo the
[1:20:50] son of Zeus elevate a human ruler to
[1:20:53] adoration backed by the power of the
[1:20:56] state for that is exactly what he saw
[1:20:58] the Roman Catholic Church fully immersed
[1:21:01] in idol worship based upon the rights of
[1:21:03] the sun god Apollo had elevated a man to
[1:21:06] actual deity the pope through the
[1:21:08] marriage of the church to the state for
[1:21:11] Thomas aquinus and alvaris Pelagius
[1:21:13] formulated and stated that the pope
[1:21:15] seems to those who view him with the
[1:21:17] spiritual eye to be not a man but a god
[1:21:21] there are no bounds to his authority he
[1:21:23] can declare to be right what he will and
[1:21:25] can take away from any their rights as
[1:21:27] he sees it sees fit to doubt this
[1:21:30] Universal Power leads to being shut out
[1:21:33] from
[1:21:33] salvation the great enemies of the
[1:21:35] church are the Heretics who will not
[1:21:38] wear the Yoke of true
[1:21:45] obedience when you go in and you begin
[1:21:48] to look at
[1:21:52] uh what the
[1:21:55] Catholic Church did that's the stance
[1:21:57] that they took you know at this time you
[1:22:00] had a lot of even back then you had a
[1:22:03] lot of different versions of
[1:22:04] Christianity that were around that were
[1:22:07] you know maybe they hadn't gone full
[1:22:09] denomination yet but they had these are
[1:22:11] our Creeds or these are our practices or
[1:22:13] this is ours and this is that and the
[1:22:15] Catholic Church took the stand
[1:22:17] that we are the only option anyone else
[1:22:20] is a complete heretic anyone
[1:22:22] else they should be be tortured they
[1:22:25] should be cast out they should be set
[1:22:28] aside as utter
[1:22:31] heathens even if they say they still
[1:22:33] worship the same Jesus Christ even if
[1:22:36] they say they do this throw them
[1:22:39] out you have to be under the offices of
[1:22:42] the Catholic Church you have to be
[1:22:44] accepting the pope you have to be going
[1:22:47] our
[1:22:49] way just like we saw in the thot tyan
[1:22:54] that you had to be worshiping the same
[1:22:56] way in order to be part of society in
[1:22:58] order to be able to work and able to be
[1:23:01] able to do any of these things and the
[1:23:03] Catholic Church took that same stand you
[1:23:05] have to be part of us you have to fall
[1:23:08] under our
[1:23:13] control now there is one mediator
[1:23:15] between God and Men the man Christ Jesus
[1:23:17] the son of God 1 Timothy 2:
[1:23:20] 5 but the pope of Rome has changed the
[1:23:23] word he made it one mediator between God
[1:23:26] and man not men so now he mediates
[1:23:29] between the mediator and men but there
[1:23:32] is no other mediator save the son the
[1:23:35] pope pronounces salvation through the
[1:23:37] Church of Rome but there is no salvation
[1:23:39] except through the Son of God no wonder
[1:23:41] the eyes blaze in fiery judgment no
[1:23:44] wonder the feet are like fine brass as
[1:23:46] he stands ready to trample into powder
[1:23:48] and dust the wicked kingdoms of this
[1:23:51] world thank God for those strong feet of
[1:23:54] brass
[1:23:55] they have passed through the Judgment
[1:23:56] for us they are now our foundation for
[1:23:59] what he gained is ours we stand
[1:24:01] identified in him Jesus the son of
[1:24:04] God it was in this age that we witnessed
[1:24:07] the rise of
[1:24:24] en forced idol worship to such an extent
[1:24:26] that it meant death to those who refused
[1:24:28] the icons of place within the church
[1:24:31] under Empress Theodora alone from 842 to
[1:24:35] 867 over a 100,000 saints were killed
[1:24:37] because they reputed the images of no
[1:24:41] value surely this age must repent or
[1:24:44] lose all there stands the Lord of glory
[1:24:48] god very God his word cast aside his
[1:24:50] person rejected but human hands and
[1:24:52] human hearts cannot depose him
[1:24:55] let them deny him he remaineth faithful
[1:24:58] fear not little flock it is your
[1:25:00] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:25:01] kingdom and when I come with feet of
[1:25:03] brass and flaming eyes I will recompense
[1:25:05] judgment is mine I will repay sayeth the
[1:25:08] Lord
[1:25:24] the
[1:25:26] eulogy I Know Thy works and love and
[1:25:29] service and faith and thy patience and
[1:25:32] thy works and the last to be more than
[1:25:34] the
[1:25:35] first here again we find the same
[1:25:37] introductory remarks I Know Thy works
[1:25:40] the Son of God himself was said believe
[1:25:42] me for the very Works sake he put an
[1:25:45] emphasis on his own Works while on Earth
[1:25:48] The Works that he did were ordained of
[1:25:49] God to inspire faith in him it was a
[1:25:52] great part of his ministry his holy
[1:25:54] spirit in the
[1:25:56] Apostle Paul said for we are his
[1:25:58] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:26:00] good works which God hath ordained that
[1:26:02] we should walk in them Ephesians 2:10
[1:26:06] these Works were to inspire faith in him
[1:26:08] as they would show forth that
[1:26:09] relationship to him that Paul described
[1:26:11] as created in him now works will never
[1:26:14] take the place of faith in God for our
[1:26:16] salvation but works will show forth our
[1:26:18] faith already placed in him good works
[1:26:21] won't save you but they will come forth
[1:26:23] out of a Sav life as fruit unto the Lord
[1:26:27] I believe in good works even if a man is
[1:26:30] not saved he ought to do good works and
[1:26:31] do the best he
[1:26:34] can what is horrible in the sight of God
[1:26:37] is for men to do evil works and then say
[1:26:39] they are doing the will of the Lord that
[1:26:42] is what the Bishops and popes and the
[1:26:43] hierarchy of Rome were doing they were
[1:26:46] killing maming and doing all manner of
[1:26:47] evil in the name of the Lord they lived
[1:26:50] out lives exactly opposite to what the
[1:26:52] word teaches in that evil day those True
[1:26:55] Believers Shone like a light in a dark
[1:26:57] place as they continually did good for
[1:26:59] they returned cursing with blessing and
[1:27:02] did the truth to honor God even though
[1:27:04] many died for
[1:27:05] it in this verse he is commending his
[1:27:08] children because they were living
[1:27:09] changed lives their Works testified to a
[1:27:13] new spirit within men saw their good
[1:27:15] works and glorified God yes sir if you
[1:27:18] are a CH Christian then you're going to
[1:27:20] do what is right your Works will show
[1:27:23] that your heart is is right and it won't
[1:27:26] be something that you put on for you
[1:27:27] will do his will when no one but God
[1:27:30] sees you and you will do his will even
[1:27:32] if it cost you your
[1:27:34] life I know your love service faith and
[1:27:39] patience you will note that their love
[1:27:41] is placed between works and service and
[1:27:44] that is the right place for it because
[1:27:46] without love our works are not accepted
[1:27:48] before God and neither is our
[1:27:51] service Paul speaking to the Corinthians
[1:27:53] said without love I am nothing whatever
[1:27:56] I do is without profit unless it is done
[1:27:58] in love now you can see right there that
[1:28:01] these Believers weren't in the nickan
[1:28:03] class that did works as a means of
[1:28:05] Salvation or to be admired by men they
[1:28:07] did their works out of the love of God
[1:28:09] that was shed abroad in their hearts by
[1:28:11] the holy ghost that love in their hearts
[1:28:13] was God's love for his
[1:28:15] own Jesus said by this shall all men
[1:28:18] know that you are my disciples that you
[1:28:20] have love one for another the pagans who
[1:28:23] saw the lives of the early Christians
[1:28:24] said behold how they love each other
[1:28:27] John said everyone that loveth is born
[1:28:30] of God first John
[1:28:33] 4:7 I want to give a warning right here
[1:28:36] it says concerning the last days that
[1:28:38] because of abounding iniquity the love
[1:28:40] of many will wax cold in lead toer the
[1:28:43] last age self-love and love for material
[1:28:45] things will take the place of the true
[1:28:46] love of God we need to guard against the
[1:28:49] power of sin in these last days so many
[1:28:52] are getting so hard because they have
[1:28:54] haven't realized the effect of this last
[1:28:55] day Spirit it is time to draw nigh to
[1:28:58] God and let him fill our lives with his
[1:29:00] love or we will feel the coldness of the
[1:29:02] last day church and reject the truth of
[1:29:05] God which alone is able to help
[1:29:11] us I think that explains pretty qu
[1:29:14] clearly why brother Wendell will spend
[1:29:16] so much time preaching about love and
[1:29:19] preaching about how we're supposed to
[1:29:21] love those around us and love our
[1:29:22] brothers and sisters and love the people
[1:29:25] in the world around us not love the
[1:29:27] world but love the
[1:29:33] people in those dark and Dreadful years
[1:29:35] the True Vine held its love for God and
[1:29:37] love of the Brethren God commended them
[1:29:40] for it I know your
[1:29:42] service Jesus said he that is greatest
[1:29:44] of all is servant to all a wise man
[1:29:47] commented on that saying here's what he
[1:29:49] said only history will prove the truth
[1:29:52] of that dictum that man was right all
[1:29:55] the truly great men of history have been
[1:29:57] servants they who demanded to be served
[1:30:00] they who oppressed they who sought to
[1:30:02] always be at the head have gone down in
[1:30:04] shame even the very rich are condemned
[1:30:06] by God when they have not used their
[1:30:08] wealth right but look into history and
[1:30:10] you will find that the truly great were
[1:30:12] those who served others history can
[1:30:14] never Acclaim those for whom much was
[1:30:16] done but it will forever praise those
[1:30:18] who did much for others now let us apply
[1:30:21] that to ourselves even as the son of man
[1:30:24] came not to be ministered unto but to
[1:30:26] minister so we are to follow that
[1:30:28] example see him as he bows himself over
[1:30:31] the feet of the Apostles and washes
[1:30:32] their tired and dirty feet he said you
[1:30:35] don't know now what I am doing but you
[1:30:37] will know Hereafter but what you see me
[1:30:40] doing you also ought to do he became a
[1:30:43] servant in order that God could Elevate
[1:30:45] him to the highest Heights and one day
[1:30:48] in the Judgment of the Saints we are
[1:30:49] going to hear him say Well done good and
[1:30:51] faithful servant enter thou into to the
[1:30:54] joy of the Lord it is hard to be always
[1:30:57] a servant but those who spend and are
[1:30:59] spent for others will one day be seated
[1:31:01] with him in his throne it will be worth
[1:31:03] it all
[1:31:04] then let us labor for the master from
[1:31:07] the Dawn Till Setting Sun let us talk of
[1:31:09] all his wondrous love and care and when
[1:31:12] all of life is over and our work on
[1:31:14] Earth is done and the role is Called Up
[1:31:16] Yonder I'll be
[1:31:19] there I know your
[1:31:22] faith now he does not here he does not
[1:31:25] St here as he did to the church in
[1:31:27] pergamus you hold my faith he's not
[1:31:30] talking about his faith now but he is
[1:31:31] commending them for their
[1:31:34] faithfulness and as he does he also
[1:31:36] mentions their
[1:31:38] patience now faithfulness and patience
[1:31:40] go together in fact patience is the
[1:31:43] outcome of faithfulness for it says in
[1:31:45] James 1:3 the trying of your faith
[1:31:47] worketh patience there is absolutely no
[1:31:50] other way in which to gain patience it
[1:31:53] has come by the trial of our faith
[1:31:55] Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience
[1:31:59] how highly God regards this outworking
[1:32:01] of our patience as seen in James
[1:32:03] 1:4 but let patience have her perfect
[1:32:06] work that you may perfect be perfect in
[1:32:09] entire lacking
[1:32:10] nothing God's will for us is perfection
[1:32:13] and that Perfection is patience waiting
[1:32:16] on God and waiting for God this is the
[1:32:20] process of character development how
[1:32:22] highly God has commended these Saints of
[1:32:24] the dark Asians patient as Lambs led to
[1:32:27] the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they
[1:32:30] served God that as all they wanted out
[1:32:32] of life just service to their lord how
[1:32:35] great was to be their
[1:32:38] reward I Know Thy works and the last to
[1:32:40] be more than the first this is certainly
[1:32:43] remarkable as the darkness of the age
[1:32:45] increased as the honor role of the
[1:32:47] martyrs grew lengthier day by day they
[1:32:50] worked all the harder they served all
[1:32:52] the more and their faith increased
[1:32:54] increased how tragic it was that in the
[1:32:56] Ephesian age love waned and truly
[1:32:58] nothing is said of the increased labor
[1:33:00] of love in the other ages but in this
[1:33:02] age in the darkest of all ages they
[1:33:04] served him even more what a lesson that
[1:33:07] is there is no ceasing of this gracious
[1:33:10] service of Love unto the Lord but rather
[1:33:12] an increasing of it that is the secret
[1:33:15] let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[1:33:17] service to the Lord our reply is
[1:33:19] increased service when the faint are
[1:33:21] crying in fear that is the time to shout
[1:33:23] the
[1:33:24] victory I Know Thy works and the last to
[1:33:27] be more than the first now as we've
[1:33:29] already said this age is called the Dark
[1:33:31] Ages because it was indeed the darkest
[1:33:33] period of all history it was the age of
[1:33:35] Pope Innocent III who claimed that he
[1:33:37] was the Vicor of Christ Su Supreme
[1:33:39] Sovereign over the church in the world
[1:33:41] who instituted the Inquisition which
[1:33:43] under his Direction shed more blood than
[1:33:46] at any other time except in
[1:33:48] Reformation it was the age of pornocracy
[1:33:50] the rule of harlots Sagittarius II had M
[1:33:54] mistress and filled the paple choir with
[1:33:56] paramor and bastard sons and turned the
[1:33:59] paple palace into a den of
[1:34:01] robbers anastasius III was smothered to
[1:34:05] death by marosia who was mistress to
[1:34:09] sarius John the 11th was Mosa's
[1:34:12] illegitimate son John the 12th was the
[1:34:15] grandson of marosia and he violated
[1:34:17] widows and virgins and was killed in the
[1:34:19] act of adultery by the woman's enraged
[1:34:21] husband it was the age of Papa Schism
[1:34:24] for two lines of popes one ruling from
[1:34:27] Aenon and the other from Rome cursed and
[1:34:30] fought each other these popes were not
[1:34:32] only guilty of immoral sex acts fing
[1:34:34] scores of illegitimate children
[1:34:36] committing sodomy Etc but were guilty of
[1:34:38] selling Priestly offices to the highest
[1:34:41] bitters it was the age when the light
[1:34:43] glowed ever so faintly yet the few
[1:34:45] Believers labored more fervently as the
[1:34:47] darkness increased until toward the end
[1:34:49] of the age many arose attempting reforms
[1:34:53] their labor were so fervent that they
[1:34:55] paved the way for the oncoming
[1:34:57] Reformation therefore as the word says
[1:34:59] concerning that age your last the End of
[1:35:01] the Age works are more than the
[1:35:05] first the word thyra has various
[1:35:07] meanings amongst which is continual
[1:35:10] Sacrifice by many this is believed to be
[1:35:12] a prophecy concerning the use of the
[1:35:14] mass which is a continual presentation
[1:35:16] of the sacrifice of Christ that is an
[1:35:18] excellent thought but it might also mean
[1:35:21] the continual sacrifice in lives and
[1:35:23] labors of the True Believers of the
[1:35:25] Lord surely these thoy and Saints were
[1:35:29] the cream of the crop full of the Holy
[1:35:31] Ghost and Faith created unto good works
[1:35:34] showing forth his praise holding not
[1:35:36] their lives dear unto themselves but
[1:35:39] gladly giving all as their SE Sweet
[1:35:42] Sacrifice unto the
[1:35:46] Lord we'll go ahead and have the
[1:35:48] musicians come back
[1:35:54] you have as always the age of contrast
[1:35:57] seeing the holy up
[1:36:00] against the immoral and the
[1:36:04] filthy it's the darkest age that we go
[1:36:07] through and yet even in that there was
[1:36:09] that little bit of light and as with the
[1:36:12] law of contrast that little bit of light
[1:36:14] stood out all the brighter because of
[1:36:16] just how dark it
[1:36:19] was and God looked down and gave him the
[1:36:22] Acclaim that your works at the end of
[1:36:24] the age are even greater than your work
[1:36:27] at the beginning while other age talks
[1:36:31] about the love of many will wax cold and
[1:36:34] you begin to you lost your first love
[1:36:36] and these different things for this age
[1:36:38] God looks down and goes you did more at
[1:36:40] the end your Works were stronger you
[1:36:43] showed more love you did
[1:36:46] more in this age of absolute
[1:36:50] Darkness you were still able to stand
[1:36:55] there was still a light the light was
[1:36:57] never snuffed out as close as the devil
[1:36:59] thought that he got as close as he got
[1:37:01] to being completely in control and
[1:37:04] having everything
[1:37:07] gone yet at the same
[1:37:10] time God moves and goes hey I'm going to
[1:37:12] put a messenger over on those islands
[1:37:15] that are completely yours they're full
[1:37:17] of Druids they're full of unbelievers
[1:37:20] they're full of evil they're full of
[1:37:22] everything else
[1:37:25] so I'm going to raise up a man to go and
[1:37:27] bring my gospel there and then out of
[1:37:30] this land of
[1:37:31] Druids I'm going to raise up the
[1:37:34] messenger for the
[1:37:36] age I'm going to go directly into where
[1:37:39] you have full
[1:37:41] control and that's what our God does
[1:37:43] with Satan he goes this is Satan's Eden
[1:37:46] you have control but yet I can come down
[1:37:50] in the midst of that and I can pull out
[1:37:53] A Perfect Bride that's right in the
[1:37:55] midst of this age when you go and
[1:37:58] Everywhere You Look is perversion and
[1:38:00] Everywhere You Look is nastiness and
[1:38:03] Everywhere You Look is sexual immorality
[1:38:05] and Everywhere You
[1:38:07] Look is the woman being held up as the
[1:38:10] worst thing that could possibly be
[1:38:13] there and God looks down and goes in
[1:38:16] this age in this Darkness I'm going to
[1:38:20] come down and I'm going to pull out my
[1:38:22] bride amen and My bride is going to be
[1:38:25] clothed in white and My bride is going
[1:38:26] to be pure and My bride is going to be
[1:38:29] impregnated with my word and My bride is
[1:38:31] going to stand and be subject to my
[1:38:35] guidelines and be subject to my word and
[1:38:37] be subject to what I
[1:38:41] have this was the age of Darkness this
[1:38:44] was the age
[1:38:45] when Satan would look at it and think
[1:38:48] that he was so close to winning
[1:38:53] and yet God would still go down and
[1:38:57] go your works at the end are even better
[1:39:00] than how the age started you're doing
[1:39:02] even more now after going through all
[1:39:04] the persecution after going through all
[1:39:06] the punishment after going through
[1:39:08] everything that you
[1:39:10] have as evil as Jezebel is in this
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:18] age yet still there's my light there's
[1:39:22] my children here
[1:39:24] and they're still standing out as a
[1:39:28] witness and we can see the same thing as
[1:39:30] we go into leod
[1:39:33] deia everything is
[1:39:37] Darkness but yet God allowed brother
[1:39:40] brandom to draw in just that little bit
[1:39:41] of
[1:39:43] light because he still had his bride and
[1:39:46] he still was going to bring out his
[1:39:49] Perfect Bride
[1:39:53] and we go through
[1:39:55] and we've all heard it said I'm sure
[1:39:57] about how brother brandom would just
[1:40:00] rail on the women and talk about how
[1:40:02] horrible they were and how awful they
[1:40:05] were and all these
[1:40:06] things but then at the same time he goes
[1:40:08] and goes but not you
[1:40:11] sisters this is
[1:40:13] what Holiness looks like this is what
[1:40:17] the absolute Jewel looks
[1:40:20] like it's that law of contrast
[1:40:25] and we see that being brought out as
[1:40:26] those two Vines continue to grow and
[1:40:28] continue to progress they're still side
[1:40:31] by side they're still going but the
[1:40:33] fruits are becoming more and more
[1:40:34] pronounced on both of
[1:40:39] them now I'm probably not quite as good
[1:40:41] at answering questions as brother
[1:40:43] Wendell I'm sure but does anyone have
[1:40:45] any comments or any questions after what
[1:40:48] we've been reading through this evening
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:58] you think of questions later give them
[1:41:00] to brother
[1:41:01] Wendell he can answer later it'll be
[1:41:07] great Kobe what are we going to

[1:42:37] Jesus the light
[1:42:40] of the
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:46] world as we go make sure that you
[1:42:48] continue to remember the different needs
[1:42:51] that we have in prayer
[1:42:54] I think I heard that Len is
[1:42:57] still down with fever so continue to
[1:43:00] remember
[1:43:03] her seems like the Lancaster household's
[1:43:05] out of the sickness now
[1:43:08] um s still dealing with a running nose
[1:43:10] but other than
[1:43:12] that we had our battle now we'll pray
[1:43:15] for others as they're going through
[1:43:16] their
[1:43:17] battle remember brother Jimmy is he'll
[1:43:19] be going into for cataract surgery
[1:43:21] tomorrow brother Wendell said and
[1:43:24] uh continue remember the Saints in
[1:43:27] Florida um as brother woman posted my
[1:43:30] mom is there um she did did not flee the
[1:43:35] state um at this moment they she
[1:43:39] and multiple others from the area are at
[1:43:42] their church as the place they evacuated
[1:43:45] to um so I'm sure they're not going to
[1:43:48] have the most comfortable night they
[1:43:49] don't all have their beds um but
[1:43:53] uh last I spoke with
[1:43:57] her storm had uh gone down to a three so
[1:44:03] it had weakened um and it was going in a
[1:44:06] little bit north of Sarasota um and if
[1:44:09] any of you have seen the radar there's
[1:44:10] almost no rain on the south side of the
[1:44:13] storm um almost all the rain is at the
[1:44:15] North and um so while there still will
[1:44:17] be plenty of strong winds um the
[1:44:20] concerns about flooding for them are a
[1:44:22] lot less
[1:44:23] now so that's that's a blessing um
[1:44:27] there'll still be some storm surge but
[1:44:29] pretty much everybody in the church
[1:44:30] lives far enough away from the coast
[1:44:33] that that's not a big problem but um if
[1:44:36] they don't get a lot of rains there's
[1:44:37] not a lot of
[1:44:39] flooding then they will be doing pretty
[1:44:42] well but um they're going to have an
[1:44:45] interesting night as the storm's going
[1:44:46] past so continue remember them in your
[1:44:49] prayers and remember all those that are
[1:44:52] that are in the p going
