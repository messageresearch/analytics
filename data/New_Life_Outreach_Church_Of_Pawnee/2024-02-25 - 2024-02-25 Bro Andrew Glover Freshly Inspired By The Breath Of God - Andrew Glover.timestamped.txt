[1:18:07] in the scripture to the book of St John
[1:18:09] we want to turn to the book of St John
[1:18:11] the 20th chapter and and we want to look
[1:18:14] in the 18th verse of St John 20 we do
[1:18:17] want to greet you this morning on behalf
[1:18:19] of our pastor brother sea the Saints
[1:18:21] there at home send their greetings to
[1:18:23] you this morning and amen it's a it's a
[1:18:26] real special treat for me to get to be
[1:18:28] here with you all on a Sunday Sunday
[1:18:30] morning Amen to just Fellowship around
[1:18:32] the word with you and see all of our
[1:18:34] friends here God bless you this morning
[1:18:36] and amen the book of St John the 20th
[1:18:39] chapter in the 18th verse we want to
[1:18:42] look here in St John 20 in verse
[1:18:46] 18 the Bible says Mary Magdalene came
[1:18:50] and told the disciples that she had seen
[1:18:53] the Lord that he had spoken these things
[1:18:56] unto her and then the same day at
[1:18:58] evening being the first day of the week
[1:19:01] when the doors were shut the disciples
[1:19:03] were assembled for fear of the Jews now
[1:19:06] I love this verse came Jesus and stood
[1:19:10] in the midst now we know that Jesus was
[1:19:13] the word made flesh so we could very
[1:19:16] well say this morning the word came and
[1:19:18] stood in the midst and said unto them
[1:19:22] peace be unto you and when he had so
[1:19:25] said and showed them them his hands in
[1:19:27] his side then were the disciples glad
[1:19:30] when they saw the Lord and then said
[1:19:33] Jesus to them again peace be unto you as
[1:19:37] my father hath sent me even so send I
[1:19:41] you and when he had said this he
[1:19:44] breathed on them and saith unto them
[1:19:48] receive ye the Holy Ghost now I love the
[1:19:51] next verse because right after after he
[1:19:53] breathes on them and says receive the
[1:19:55] Holy Ghost he says whosoever sins you
[1:19:58] remit they are remitted unto them and
[1:20:00] whosoever sins you retain they are
[1:20:03] retained so after he breathed on them he
[1:20:06] literally breathed Authority into them
[1:20:09] that they could remit sins and retain
[1:20:11] sins because it would not be them it
[1:20:14] would be the god that had just come into
[1:20:16] them that had breathed upon them he
[1:20:18] breathed upon them and said receive ye
[1:20:20] the Holy Ghost we ask Lord this morning
[1:20:22] to add the blessing to the reading of
[1:20:24] his word as you can have your seats here
[1:20:26] this morning amen from those scriptures
[1:20:28] for just a few moments I want to by the
[1:20:31] help of the Lord to speak to you today
[1:20:33] and if I will title this I want to speak
[1:20:34] to you on freshly inspired by the Breath
[1:20:37] of God freshly inspired by the Breath of
[1:20:41] God you know amen I believe if there
[1:20:43] ever was a time amen that we could use a
[1:20:46] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[1:20:49] amen I believe we could use it now amen
[1:20:51] I believe we could use a refreshing in
[1:20:53] our homes I believe we could use a
[1:20:54] refreshing in our Ministries a
[1:20:56] refreshing Amen in our young people a
[1:20:58] refreshing in our church I believe amen
[1:21:01] from the eldest to the youngest we could
[1:21:02] all amen use a refreshing from the
[1:21:05] presence of God and when you start
[1:21:07] thinking about that word refreshing of
[1:21:09] course you know uh that the root word
[1:21:11] there of refresh is to Fresh it means
[1:21:13] fresh and I looked at that definition it
[1:21:16] means having its original qualities
[1:21:19] unimpaired it's Fuller or renewed in
[1:21:21] Vigor now it's it's not stale it's not
[1:21:24] sour it's not decayed amen and it's not
[1:21:27] faded I love this one and it's not
[1:21:29] altered by processing so when something
[1:21:31] is fresh amen it's not stale it's not
[1:21:34] decayed it's not weak it's not sour amen
[1:21:38] but it has still got the same qualities
[1:21:41] that it had amen when it was first given
[1:21:43] now when you look at that word qualities
[1:21:45] it is the standard of something amen as
[1:21:48] measured against other things of a
[1:21:50] similar kind it is the degree of
[1:21:52] Excellence or something now I love this
[1:21:55] it is distinctive attribute or
[1:21:57] characteristic amen that is possessed by
[1:22:00] someone or something so when something
[1:22:02] is fresh the characteristic of it has
[1:22:05] not changed amen but it still has the
[1:22:07] same Vigor still has the same strength
[1:22:10] amen it's still in its original
[1:22:12] condition now I love what the prophet
[1:22:14] said in believe us th this now he says
[1:22:16] remember amen that Jesus had all the
[1:22:19] qualities of the father in him do you
[1:22:21] believe that amen sure he did all the
[1:22:24] fine gifts of God was in Christ his son
[1:22:27] amen for he was The Offspring of God
[1:22:29] another place he said and Jesus was
[1:22:31] possessed amen with all the fine
[1:22:34] qualities of God Amen but we but then he
[1:22:37] turns and says but when he met Satan in
[1:22:39] Matthew 4 he did not use any of those
[1:22:42] qualities he used the word all right
[1:22:44] when he met the devil he did not use any
[1:22:47] of the qualities that was given to him
[1:22:49] of the father amen he relied on the word
[1:22:51] and he said the these things it is
[1:22:53] written amen that man shall not live by
[1:22:55] bread alone so in other words he was by
[1:22:58] the word bringing into reach of the
[1:23:00] weakest of Christians amen the same word
[1:23:03] and the same quality of word amen that
[1:23:06] was in the beginning now amen to draw a
[1:23:08] thought this morning I want to read just
[1:23:09] a few paragraphs here from 1956 here ye
[1:23:13] him on Matthew Matthew 17 brother I'm
[1:23:15] speaking of Jesus on Mount
[1:23:17] Transfiguration he said now you know
[1:23:19] that God's word is so Eternal it is so
[1:23:22] inspired that it's not just for one
[1:23:24] occasion or for one generation but the
[1:23:26] word of God Is So Eternal it is the same
[1:23:30] it is the truth amen the word of God is
[1:23:32] the same the word of God is eternal amen
[1:23:35] and the word of God is the truth he said
[1:23:37] this same word amen that inspired the
[1:23:40] disciples it inspired the first or
[1:23:42] disciples and then the next as they
[1:23:44] followed down through the Lutheran age
[1:23:46] the Methodist age and every age amen is
[1:23:48] just as sufficient and inspiring today
[1:23:52] Amen to to us as it was the first day it
[1:23:54] was given amen and if the world should
[1:23:57] stand a million years amen that word
[1:24:00] would still be just as Inspire Amen to
[1:24:02] the generations that will follow us as
[1:24:04] it is to us amen because it is perfect
[1:24:08] he said one great way we could approach
[1:24:10] this afternoon as the coming of the Lord
[1:24:12] see amen first to Moses then Elijah and
[1:24:15] then Jesus amen but then we notice Peter
[1:24:17] while he was there amen he had just been
[1:24:20] freshly inspired amen because he gave a
[1:24:23] witness to who Jesus was amen and he was
[1:24:27] inspired now here amen you've got Jesus
[1:24:29] up on the mountain amen and there's
[1:24:32] Moses and there's Elijah from the Old
[1:24:34] Testament amen and here is Jesus amen
[1:24:37] the word made flesh so the same word
[1:24:40] amen that they were writing about is now
[1:24:42] standing in their midst Amen in flesh
[1:24:45] amen but here's also Peter amen who's
[1:24:47] from the New Testament amen but the same
[1:24:50] effect that the word had on MOS Moses
[1:24:53] and Elijah it was now having on Peter
[1:24:55] amen because the word does not change it
[1:24:57] is the same yesterday amen today and
[1:25:00] forever amen the prophet said now when a
[1:25:03] man is inspired and he reads the
[1:25:05] inspired word then the two Inspirations
[1:25:08] gives a result he said no matter how
[1:25:11] well you study the word it'll never do
[1:25:13] you no good till you are inspired
[1:25:15] yourself it takes your inspiration the
[1:25:18] word is already inspired how many can
[1:25:21] say thank God amen that I come to church
[1:25:24] and the word is already inspired now if
[1:25:26] you'll be honest there's many times you
[1:25:28] come amen that if you're honest with
[1:25:30] yourself you're not inspired you've had
[1:25:32] a bad day or you're going through a
[1:25:34] situation or something's happening amen
[1:25:36] but thank God that the word is always
[1:25:39] inspired amen he said so what we need
[1:25:41] today is an inspiration over us amen God
[1:25:45] sweeping down with a new inspiration and
[1:25:47] breathing over us his power and his love
[1:25:50] and himself that it might Inspire us to
[1:25:53] Quicken us and to awaken us to his word
[1:25:56] and when the word being brought in the
[1:25:58] spirit of inspiration then you'll see
[1:26:00] miracles happen and things take place
[1:26:03] because the two amen just comes together
[1:26:06] amen so what is inspiring this word
[1:26:08] bride amen is not a feeling it's not a
[1:26:11] sensation amen but what is inspiring the
[1:26:14] bride amen is the same word that
[1:26:16] inspired the disciples that inspired
[1:26:19] Moses and inspired Elijah and inspired
[1:26:22] that word amen has come into the midst
[1:26:25] of the church in the last day amen to
[1:26:27] breathe over the church amen to awaken
[1:26:30] them from the things of Leota and to
[1:26:32] bring them into a clear understanding
[1:26:35] amen of their full position as a
[1:26:37] Believer listen we're not a bunch of
[1:26:39] defeated Believers here today amen if
[1:26:41] we're following this word amen then the
[1:26:43] same inspiration amen that was moving in
[1:26:46] the alpha has come into the Omega and
[1:26:49] we're moving and miracles are happening
[1:26:51] and things are happening amen because
[1:26:54] the word is always inspired amen I love
[1:26:57] to say it like this on my good days the
[1:26:59] word is inspired and on my bad days the
[1:27:02] word is inspired amen when I feel good
[1:27:04] in my body the word is inspired and when
[1:27:06] I'm sick in my body amen the word is
[1:27:09] inspired because this is not a word with
[1:27:12] a certain meaning amen for a temporary
[1:27:14] time amen but this is an eternal word
[1:27:17] and it still has its original qualities
[1:27:20] and they're unimpaired and they're not
[1:27:22] sour and they're not decayed amen but
[1:27:25] they're just as fresh today as they were
[1:27:28] when the word was spoken he said every
[1:27:31] generation can pick up the same word
[1:27:34] because it's inspired it's Eternal it's
[1:27:37] Everlasting it's a nonfading declaration
[1:27:40] from God no matter if the apostles read
[1:27:43] it in their age it meant something for
[1:27:45] them if Wesley read it in his age and
[1:27:47] Luther in his age and Calvin in his age
[1:27:50] amen but yet today it's just as
[1:27:52] brilliant and bright and got just as
[1:27:55] much of an effect as it did for them
[1:27:57] amen on the very day it was spoken in
[1:28:00] other words he said if you say John you
[1:28:02] come over to my house I'll be glad to
[1:28:04] see you amen that's a man's words and it
[1:28:07] just means John come over to our house
[1:28:09] but when God speaks amen there's a
[1:28:12] difference in when a man speaks and when
[1:28:14] God speaks he said when God speaks it's
[1:28:17] Eternal amen it's breathed from the very
[1:28:19] breath of the immortal everlas lasting
[1:28:22] Creator himself so there's no way to
[1:28:25] ever find the full meaning of any
[1:28:27] expression of God Amen it's for every
[1:28:29] age and every generation I don't believe
[1:28:32] we got to sit here amen and look back to
[1:28:34] 30 years ago or 20 years ago or 10 years
[1:28:38] ago and we might as well preach we here
[1:28:40] or even five years ago and say I
[1:28:42] remember in the old church and I
[1:28:44] remember when we first come I'm oh no I
[1:28:46] don't believe we got to look back Amen
[1:28:48] to see God Amen but I believe the God
[1:28:51] Amen that was moving 30 years ago amen
[1:28:53] it's the same God who is here
[1:28:55] manifesting himself amen as a God that
[1:28:58] does not fade as a God that does not
[1:29:00] fail listen Church there is a nonfading
[1:29:03] declaration that has been spoken over
[1:29:05] your life by this message and if you can
[1:29:08] renounce every dishonest thing and
[1:29:10] believe the report of the Lord it'll
[1:29:12] release an inspiration it'll bring a
[1:29:15] refreshing it'll bring a renewing amen
[1:29:17] you'll fall in love with Jesus all over
[1:29:20] again amen because it's not a stale word
[1:29:23] amen it's an inspired
[1:29:25] word amen the word of God is Not sour
[1:29:28] it's inspired amen now in job 32:8 amen
[1:29:32] I love this the Bible says amen that
[1:29:34] there is a spirit in man amen and the
[1:29:37] inspiration of the almighty amen giveth
[1:29:40] them understanding that word inspiration
[1:29:42] means breath it means Spirit Breath of
[1:29:45] God breath of man amen every breathing
[1:29:47] thing the spirit of man amen now we have
[1:29:50] the definition of the word inspiration
[1:29:53] amen as the Breath of God so in other
[1:29:55] words we could say Amen that the breath
[1:29:58] of the almighty God Amen is the
[1:30:00] inspiration of the almighty amen the
[1:30:03] Breath of God Amen is the inspiration of
[1:30:06] the almighty god brother said oh God who
[1:30:08] formed the heavens and the Earth amen
[1:30:10] and just let his breath go forth with
[1:30:12] his word and everything take in its
[1:30:14] right position now listen the Earth the
[1:30:17] moon the stars all swung into place amen
[1:30:20] just as God breathe on his word and oh
[1:30:23] God today we ask that you'll breathe on
[1:30:25] your word as we are trying to bring it
[1:30:27] to your people may it take its position
[1:30:30] this morning its place and be rooted and
[1:30:33] grounded in every heart that every
[1:30:35] person here amen might receive your full
[1:30:38] blessing now let me say this when you
[1:30:40] look at the Moon tonight amen remember
[1:30:43] that the Moon is there by the Breath of
[1:30:45] God when you look at the trees remember
[1:30:47] the trees are there amen by the Breath
[1:30:49] of God when you see the stars come out
[1:30:52] and take their position in the solar
[1:30:53] system amen don't think that there's
[1:30:55] something holding it there amen the what
[1:30:58] put it there is the Breath of God and
[1:31:00] what's holding is air is the Breath of
[1:31:02] God so here the prophet is saying amen
[1:31:05] that the moon the Earth the Stars amen
[1:31:07] they all took their place amen as God's
[1:31:10] word breathed upon them listen some of
[1:31:12] you all this morning amen you don't need
[1:31:14] a new church you don't need a new pastor
[1:31:17] you don't need a new job you don't need
[1:31:19] a raise on your job Amen to get back in
[1:31:21] your position you just need the Breath
[1:31:23] of God Amen to breathe across the church
[1:31:26] again amen and you'll swing out of
[1:31:28] depression and you'll swing into joy
[1:31:30] unspeakable you just need the Breath of
[1:31:32] God Amen to breathe upon your family to
[1:31:35] breathe upon your body listen I still
[1:31:37] believe that when God begins to breathe
[1:31:39] amen things begin to change I believe
[1:31:42] when God begins to breathe his word
[1:31:44] across his creation things begin to
[1:31:46] change if he could do it in the natural
[1:31:49] creation he can do it in the spiritual
[1:31:51] creation because he's God and His word
[1:31:54] never
[1:31:54] changes May the Breath of God move
[1:31:57] across the church and it take its
[1:31:59] position he said father I think how that
[1:32:02] you ever stoop down Amen to pick up a
[1:32:04] poor sinner lost like myself but by the
[1:32:07] grace of God now I am your child he said
[1:32:10] many others in here Lord amen they feel
[1:32:13] the same way we're here just breathing
[1:32:16] amen because you let us
[1:32:18] breathe your great spirit is moving
[1:32:21] through this building like the air
[1:32:24] that's circulating over here now can I
[1:32:26] say this every breath we draw it comes
[1:32:29] from the divine grace of God pro God
[1:32:32] said Every Breath You ever breathe amen
[1:32:34] it came from God now if you go to
[1:32:36] Genesis 2 you'll find that is the first
[1:32:39] time the word breath is mentioned in the
[1:32:41] Bible in Genesis 2:7 the Bible says the
[1:32:44] Lord God for man of the Dust of the
[1:32:47] ground and he breathed into his nostrils
[1:32:50] the breath of life he amen and Man
[1:32:52] became a living Soul now the prophet
[1:32:55] picks this up and question answers on
[1:32:57] Genesis and said I can see Adam standing
[1:33:00] let's take this way seem standing like a
[1:33:02] tree amen God had made him now watch he
[1:33:04] was dead as he could be his toes like
[1:33:07] the roots sticking in the ground amen
[1:33:09] but God said let there be or he breathed
[1:33:12] the breath of life into him and he
[1:33:14] jumped and came to himself see he
[1:33:17] breathed the breath of life into him and
[1:33:19] he became a living soul he said now he
[1:33:22] begin to move on and on Amen so here is
[1:33:25] Adam amen Genesis 1 creation Genesis 2
[1:33:28] creation and here is Adam amen standing
[1:33:31] in the ground his toes like the roots
[1:33:34] amen he's got life there as far as being
[1:33:36] created amen but there's no life in him
[1:33:39] amen but when God breathes upon him he
[1:33:41] comes to himself amen and recognizes who
[1:33:44] he is amen now it don't take long to
[1:33:46] remember in Luke 15 amen that there was
[1:33:49] a prodical son and the Bible say said he
[1:33:51] belonged in the father's house amen but
[1:33:54] he found himself among the swine amen
[1:33:56] but one day amen there was a breath come
[1:33:58] by his way and the Bible said he came to
[1:34:01] himself and realized I'm out of my
[1:34:03] position I don't belong in the sign I
[1:34:06] don't belong in the pig pin amen I got a
[1:34:08] father I've got a home listen friends
[1:34:11] and the Breath of God Amen brought the
[1:34:13] prodical son amen from the hall pin back
[1:34:15] to the father's house that was the same
[1:34:18] breath that brought Adam to recognition
[1:34:20] that he was in amateure God and he was
[1:34:23] created with a godship and a sunship and
[1:34:26] a Dominion as the Son of God well may I
[1:34:28] say that's the same breath amen that's
[1:34:30] breathing in this building this morning
[1:34:32] Amen to remind you you are a son of God
[1:34:35] you are an amateur God you've got the
[1:34:37] authority of God you got the power of
[1:34:39] God you got the word of God you don't
[1:34:42] have to stay out of position any longer
[1:34:44] there is a breath of wind coming from
[1:34:47] the word of God to swing you back into
[1:34:49] your position and anchor you there with
[1:34:52] the word of God rooted and
[1:34:55] grounded rooted and grounded into your
[1:34:58] heart now a minute I'm just going to lay
[1:35:00] a foundation if that's okay because the
[1:35:02] Breath of God brought Adam to himself
[1:35:05] you realize that the same breath amen is
[1:35:08] connected to Creation in Isaiah 42:5 the
[1:35:12] Bible says thus saith the good the thus
[1:35:14] saith God the Lord he that create the
[1:35:16] heavens and stretched them out he that
[1:35:19] spreaded forth the Earth and that which
[1:35:21] cometh out of it now I love this verse
[1:35:24] because the Bible said he created the
[1:35:26] heavens and he stretched them out amen
[1:35:29] and he spread forth over the Earth amen
[1:35:31] and then he created that which come out
[1:35:32] of it he giveth the breath unto the
[1:35:35] people upon it amen and the spirit to
[1:35:38] them that walk
[1:35:40] therein so in other words he creates the
[1:35:43] heavens he creates the Earth then he
[1:35:46] creates the things that come out of it
[1:35:48] amen but then he returns and the same
[1:35:50] breath created it he now breathes into
[1:35:54] it to supply them the ability and the
[1:35:56] spirit amen to walk upon what he has
[1:35:59] created amen this is a simple
[1:36:00] illustration am but it's like this amen
[1:36:03] you take a man named Walt Disney and he
[1:36:05] makes Disney World and he's got all
[1:36:07] these rides and all these attractions
[1:36:08] and all the and he goes down there and
[1:36:10] creates all this and then he calls you
[1:36:13] and says I've created it there it is but
[1:36:15] the problem is amen you look at the
[1:36:17] prices and we realize am me you created
[1:36:19] something a little expensive buddy you
[1:36:21] know amen so you're look at the prices
[1:36:22] you're say there no way I can afford to
[1:36:24] spend seven days here amen but then Walt
[1:36:26] Disney turns around and says well I
[1:36:28] created it and here's you the memes to
[1:36:30] go in and enjoy it in other words he did
[1:36:33] not just create it for you to stand on
[1:36:35] the outside and say it's a nice creation
[1:36:38] I wish I could enjoy it but he returns
[1:36:40] and gives you the token amen the ability
[1:36:43] to go in and enjoy listen friends God
[1:36:45] didn't send this message amen as a
[1:36:47] creation spoken word amen for you to sit
[1:36:50] on the outside and say I wish I could
[1:36:52] enjoy that I wish I could believe that
[1:36:54] amen but the same God that created the
[1:36:57] heavens and the Earth is the same God
[1:36:59] that responds you with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:02] listen you ain't got to stay out of the
[1:37:03] blessings of God you ain't got to stay
[1:37:05] out of the anointing you ain't got to
[1:37:07] stay out of the inspiration there has
[1:37:09] been a way provided for every believer
[1:37:12] to move into the provision of God by the
[1:37:15] Breath of God you don't have to stay on
[1:37:18] the outside God has made a way for you
[1:37:21] to come into these things and to enjoy
[1:37:23] them he said you are The God Who breathe
[1:37:25] the you breathe the forth the first
[1:37:27] breath of life that ever come on the
[1:37:29] earth and has control of every life
[1:37:32] until this present time and shall
[1:37:34] forever more control amen for thou art
[1:37:37] the
[1:37:38] creator of all mankind and all things
[1:37:42] that breathe brother another place he
[1:37:44] said upon the mountains at night time
[1:37:46] watching the great planations and so
[1:37:48] forth the great planets of the heavens
[1:37:50] and the solar system system knowing you
[1:37:52] made them and you spun them out with
[1:37:54] your hands now watch this you blowed
[1:37:57] your breath in the palm of your hand and
[1:37:59] every Star come into existence he was
[1:38:03] holding in his hand brother Wendell amen
[1:38:05] the stars but when that powerful
[1:38:07] Immortal breath be to Bow across his
[1:38:10] hand he said every Star come into
[1:38:13] existence now you all know Isaiah 14
[1:38:16] amen says that the devil in the last
[1:38:17] days would exalt himself amen above the
[1:38:21] the Throne of God above the stars of God
[1:38:24] Amen and a Prophet come and said the
[1:38:26] stars of God are the sons of God so in
[1:38:29] the last days amen Lucifer would come
[1:38:32] into the church and he would try to
[1:38:34] disposition amen the stars of God from
[1:38:37] their position amen but at the same time
[1:38:40] amen that Satan would blow his poisonous
[1:38:42] breath would be when the wind of God
[1:38:44] would return to the church and while the
[1:38:47] devil was trying to disposition you amen
[1:38:49] the anointing would be position Ling you
[1:38:52] amen as an identified believer in the
[1:38:54] word of almighty God Amen I believe it
[1:38:56] today I believe amen that breath is a
[1:38:59] sign of
[1:39:00] Life y'all hear me breath is a sign of
[1:39:03] life amen if somebody Falls over amen
[1:39:05] you call 911 what's the first thing they
[1:39:07] say are they breathing because breath is
[1:39:10] a sign of life amen if there is no
[1:39:12] breath amen there is no life now I'm
[1:39:14] going to preach this morning if that's
[1:39:16] okay if there is no breath then there is
[1:39:18] no life and the prophet said now the
[1:39:20] baby is born with live muscles he's got
[1:39:23] a beating heart amen but no Breath of
[1:39:25] Life in it the muscles are twitching
[1:39:27] then see if there was something
[1:39:29] different from that if there wasn't a
[1:39:31] spirit that had to come in later then
[1:39:33] our breath could leave us and we would
[1:39:35] Breathe No More and still be alive but
[1:39:38] when this body doesn't receive oxygen or
[1:39:40] breath when this body how many believes
[1:39:43] this church is the body how many
[1:39:45] believes that you are a part how many
[1:39:46] believes that new life Outreach amen is
[1:39:49] a part of the of the universal body of
[1:39:52] Jesus Christ if this body does not
[1:39:54] receive oxygen or breath brother says
[1:39:56] intake and outake of our lungs amen then
[1:39:59] we are dead now I tell you how I read
[1:40:02] that amen is we got to take some things
[1:40:04] in and we got to put some things out
[1:40:07] amen as a body you're going to take some
[1:40:09] things in and some things you got to
[1:40:11] take in but some things you got to put
[1:40:13] out amen and if you if all you do is
[1:40:15] take in take in take in amen you are
[1:40:18] dead amen because the prophet set a sign
[1:40:21] of life is the ability to intake and
[1:40:23] outake I might as well preach amen cuz a
[1:40:26] lot of times amen the things that we're
[1:40:28] taking in amen are things we need to put
[1:40:30] out amen we take in problems and we hold
[1:40:33] on to our problems we take in situations
[1:40:36] and we hold on to the situation amen and
[1:40:38] before long the church gets so deprived
[1:40:40] of oxygen that you can't even praise
[1:40:43] well we might as well preach you can't
[1:40:45] even sing no more you can't even worship
[1:40:47] no more because all you're doing is
[1:40:49] intake and intake and y'all know why the
[1:40:51] dead Sea's dead amen because it's got an
[1:40:54] inlet but it don't have an outlet so
[1:40:56] everything comes in it doesn't mean it's
[1:40:58] good for it amen and every devil that
[1:41:00] comes along your way it does not mean
[1:41:02] you got to entertain that devil there is
[1:41:04] a breath of wind from the holy ghost
[1:41:07] that you have been given a powerful set
[1:41:09] of lungs Amen to breathe out the
[1:41:11] problems and to breathe in the promise
[1:41:13] you have been given a powerful come on
[1:41:15] church to breathe out depression and to
[1:41:17] breathe in joy you have been given a
[1:41:20] powerful set of lungs Amen to breathe
[1:41:22] out negativity and to breathe in
[1:41:24] positivity I say oh God let our lungs
[1:41:27] amen fill up with the Wind of the Holy
[1:41:30] Ghost again until we can breathe like a
[1:41:32] church ought to breathe we can sing like
[1:41:35] a church ought to sing We can preach
[1:41:37] like a church ought to preach we can
[1:41:39] pull like a church ought to pull amen
[1:41:41] God breathe in US Lord breathe into our
[1:41:44] lungs breathe into our church breathe
[1:41:46] into our young people let the Breath of
[1:41:48] God breathe in the church again and
[1:41:50] until we breathe out everything that's
[1:41:52] contrary to the message of the hour and
[1:41:55] let the wind of God hallelujah blow in
[1:41:57] the church again now amen you got to
[1:41:59] breathe some things out that's right you
[1:42:02] got to breathe some things out and you
[1:42:05] got to breathe some things in you know
[1:42:07] what builds powerful lungs is the
[1:42:09] ability to breathe in and the ability to
[1:42:11] breathe out now another thing that
[1:42:13] breath in the Bible is connected to is
[1:42:17] praise the Bible says let let me back up
[1:42:20] here for second the Bible says that that
[1:42:22] the spirit of the Living God of almighty
[1:42:24] God the inspiration is what giveth
[1:42:27] giveth us understanding y'all believe
[1:42:30] that the spirit of the inspiration of
[1:42:32] the almighty God is what gives us
[1:42:35] understanding thinking men's filter said
[1:42:37] Grant Lord that we may know how that we
[1:42:38] should give you praise it's beyond our
[1:42:42] understanding to know how to give you
[1:42:44] praise it's beyond our understanding to
[1:42:47] know how to give you praise so it's
[1:42:49] beyond our ability amen it's beyond I
[1:42:53] said it this way amen we do not possess
[1:42:55] the human ability to know how to praise
[1:42:58] a God Like Our God listen we don't know
[1:43:01] how to praise a God that created the
[1:43:03] heavens and the Earth we don't know how
[1:43:04] to praise a God that spoke to nothing
[1:43:07] and created everything we don't know how
[1:43:09] to praise a God Amen that can raise the
[1:43:11] dead can heal the blind can restore the
[1:43:14] Lost we don't know how to praise a god
[1:43:16] like that but in the end time a prophet
[1:43:19] would come and say here it is let

[1:43:36] you don't know how to do it but I'll
[1:43:38] Supply you the breath to do it and the
[1:43:40] breath that I give you will be the
[1:43:43] understanding of how to praise me so we

[1:43:48] don't have to know how to say the right
[1:43:49] words they only thing thing we got to

[1:47:31] with come on church amen but we're not
[1:47:34] here to agree with each other if we can
[1:47:36] all agree with the word then the Oneness
[1:47:39] with the word will bring a unity in the
[1:47:42] church come on church if we can all
[1:47:45] agree that the message is right and the
[1:47:47] word is absolute and the word has let
[1:47:50] amen then you might not agree with me
[1:47:53] and I might not agree with you but if we
[1:47:54] agree with the same word then somewhere
[1:47:57] there's going to come a liberty of unity
[1:47:59] in the body and we'll realize we're not
[1:48:01] here just to agree with each other we
[1:48:03] are agreeing with the
[1:48:05] word I know what I'm talking about it's
[1:48:07] here so I might as well preach amen how
[1:48:09] long are we going to choke the
[1:48:10] atmosphere over things we don't agree
[1:48:12] with how long are we going to choke the
[1:48:14] anointing out of the meetings because
[1:48:16] somebody sng a song that we don't like
[1:48:19] somebody read a scripture that we didn't
[1:48:20] think all to be ready to this s come on
[1:48:22] chur I think it's time to release the
[1:48:24] atmosphere I think listen our young
[1:48:27] people need the Holy Ghost our churches
[1:48:29] need to move amen release the atmosphere
[1:48:32] take your hands off of it and let the
[1:48:34] anointing flow again until our young
[1:48:37] people can know what it's like to get
[1:48:38] carried away in the anointing come on
[1:48:41] Church take your hands off the
[1:48:42] atmosphere and let God breathed in the
[1:48:45] church

[1:48:48] well I don't think they ought to stand I
[1:48:50] don't think we ought to shout I don't
[1:48:52] think we ought to say that well we might
[1:48:53] not like sitting so let the sitter sit
[1:48:56] and the standers stand and the singers
[1:48:58] sing and the preachers preach and the
[1:49:00] criers cry and the runners run and the
[1:49:03] shouters shout and the teachers teach
[1:49:06] let's just get back to Heaven church
[1:49:07] again where the wind of God could blow
[1:49:10] in the church with power and authority
[1:49:13] and
[1:49:15] Liberty blow the cobwebs out of the
[1:49:17] atmosphere and let the anointing come
[1:49:19] back in the
[1:49:22] church well I don't like this I amen
[1:49:25] there's a lot of things we don't like

[1:49:50] get this idea now if God's going to be
[1:49:51] in the song service we got to sing songs
[1:49:53] that Luther didn't even know cuz those
[1:49:55] are real old songs and those are the
[1:49:57] real anointed songs and listen I've sat
[1:49:59] in those Mee brother William and we sang
[1:50:01] those songs and there wasn't an ounce
[1:50:03] more of anointing come in the building
[1:50:05] amen than when we sang a new song you
[1:50:07] know why because it's not the song it's
[1:50:09] your attitude towards the song is what
[1:50:11] changes the atmosphere in the meeting

[1:50:42] devil out and there's going to come an
[1:50:44] anointing there going to come a liberty
[1:50:46] there going to come a healing I said God
[1:50:48] open up the atmosphere appear again
[1:50:50] until the wind of God can blow in his
[1:50:53] creation and God can rejoice in his
[1:50:59] people well I don't think they ought to
[1:51:01] preach those things well it's a message
[1:51:02] church so what do you want us to
[1:51:05] preach come on you want a Baptist idea
[1:51:07] this ain't a Baptist Church this is a
[1:51:09] message church so in a message church we
[1:51:11] preach the
[1:51:15] message come on the message is still
[1:51:18] inspired yes sir come on now you know
[1:51:21] why oh
[1:51:22] mercy now let me say this the devil get
[1:51:25] among people and they say well then I
[1:51:27] tell you why people shouting like that
[1:51:28] that kind of teaching amen there false
[1:51:30] spirits in the last days will invade
[1:51:31] pull pits no don't get mad at us because
[1:51:34] you had a stale version of the message
[1:51:35] give to you come on we're not feeding on
[1:51:38] a stale version our message has not been
[1:51:41] altered by some personality that's
[1:51:43] processed what a prophet said we are
[1:51:45] standing on Vindicated word and there's
[1:51:47] a liberty in this word we can teach the
[1:51:49] seventh seal we can teach the son of man
[1:51:52] we can preach the third pull because
[1:51:54] we're in the channel of inspiration
[1:51:57] where God can blow in the
[1:52:00] church well yall know it's the truth
[1:52:02] brother said now the breath is the wind
[1:52:04] and the wind is what you breae in your
[1:52:06] nostrils now y'all familiar with the
[1:52:07] tape Blasphemous names aren't you comes
[1:52:10] in the air and he says these words he
[1:52:11] said now I'm going to correct the
[1:52:12] Jehovah Witness teaching because they
[1:52:15] teach that the breath you breathe is the
[1:52:17] soul he said that's not right
[1:52:21] he said now watch the breath is wind and
[1:52:24] the wind is what you breathe in the
[1:52:25] nostrils then he goes to Genesis 2 and
[1:52:28] said but what God did is he breathed the
[1:52:30] breath of eternal life amen then he
[1:52:34] became a living Soul a soul that cannot
[1:52:37] die oh my now notice he breathed the
[1:52:40] breath I love this brother William of
[1:52:43] eternal life into his nostrils and he
[1:52:46] became an eternal Soul CA God breathed
[1:52:49] not what nature do done but what God did
[1:52:51] breathe the breath of life into his
[1:52:52] nostrils he become a living Soul then
[1:52:54] you say to me Adam died brother brandom
[1:52:56] but remember before Adam died he had a
[1:52:58] lamb amen that redeemed him Hallelujah
[1:53:01] those he fornew he has called he got a
[1:53:04] lamb to redeem them he was a type and
[1:53:07] Adam fell then the lamb was provided for
[1:53:09] Adam because already in his nostrils had
[1:53:12] become the breath of the Eternal God and
[1:53:16] he became a living Soul he was a son of
[1:53:19] God notice this the prophet of God said
[1:53:21] we're not breathing amoya he said amoya
[1:53:23] is the wind or the Unseen Force he said
[1:53:25] animals breathe amoya Sinners breathe
[1:53:27] aoya he said but God especially upon
[1:53:30] Adam he breathed the breath of eternal
[1:53:32] life and he became an eternal person
[1:53:34] with God he had power like God he was an
[1:53:37] amateur God he was God of the earth not
[1:53:40] God Of Heaven god of the earth now watch
[1:53:42] this God in Adam made him the god of the
[1:53:44] earth brother B stops and says now and
[1:53:47] someday the sons of God will again
[1:53:50] become
[1:53:52] Gods someday the sons of God will again
[1:53:56] become Gods how will they do that amen
[1:53:59] it is written in your law you are God if
[1:54:01] you call those who called God God
[1:54:03] visited how can you condemn me when I
[1:54:05] say I am the Son of God can I say this
[1:54:08] the same breath that breathed into Adam
[1:54:11] and made him a living soul and breathe
[1:54:13] and the breath become eternal life and
[1:54:15] made him a god of the earth is the same
[1:54:18] breath amen that's breed in the true
[1:54:20] church and the prophet says the church
[1:54:22] is the mystical Body of Christ amen born
[1:54:26] of the Breath of God the Church of God
[1:54:28] is born of the Breath of God because God
[1:54:30] breathed into the nostrils spiritually
[1:54:32] of Adam and he become a living Soul let
[1:54:35] me read you and see whether the church
[1:54:36] is born of the Breath of God or not like
[1:54:38] Adam was in the beginning and he reads
[1:54:40] John 20 and he says now watch the father
[1:54:43] has sent him went in him and Jesus when
[1:54:46] he sends a disciple he goes in him then
[1:54:49] he reads read to uh 20 John 20 again and
[1:54:52] says Church born of the Breath of God
[1:54:54] when this stature has molded itself up
[1:54:56] there somebody say molded molded itself
[1:55:00] up there when the stature has molded
[1:55:04] itself up there in condition amen God
[1:55:06] breathes a breath upon them and says
[1:55:09] receive ye the Holy Ghost then you are a
[1:55:11] son of God and you can enjoy you can
[1:55:13] join anything you want to but you're
[1:55:15] born into the church of living God Amen
[1:55:18] you are born by the Breath of God now
[1:55:20] watch a prophet God breathed upon them
[1:55:23] and said receive ye the Holy
[1:55:27] Ghost God breathed upon them brother
[1:55:30] Duran and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:55:34] now watch this there you are not com and
[1:55:36] join amen but when you become a child of
[1:55:39] God you are born by the Breath of God
[1:55:42] can I say this you do not join the
[1:55:44] church you do not join the word amen you
[1:55:47] are born by the word and the prophet
[1:55:49] said this is the word of the Lord then
[1:55:51] it's his premeditated thoughts that's
[1:55:53] how we have eternal life because we were
[1:55:56] spoken into existence by God not joined
[1:55:59] into a church but born by the word the
[1:56:02] original seed that God said let there be
[1:56:05] and there was listen you have come into
[1:56:08] existence amen by The Original Seed of
[1:56:11] the original word that was spoken by the
[1:56:13] only true Living God and you have come
[1:56:16] into existence amen by the Breath of God
[1:56:19] now let me say this what whatever
[1:56:22] brought you into existence is the only
[1:56:24] thing that can take you out are you
[1:56:26] hearing me whatever brought you into
[1:56:28] existence is the only thing that can
[1:56:30] take you out that's why the prophet of
[1:56:32] God said the devil can do what he wants
[1:56:33] to amen but he cannot take my life until
[1:56:36] God is finished with me on the earth he
[1:56:38] said well brother Andrew the devil took
[1:56:40] him no the devil didn't take him amen
[1:56:42] God released him amen from this
[1:56:44] Tabernacle of humiliation this pest
[1:56:46] house Amen to go to his father's house
[1:56:49] let me say this there's a reason why the
[1:56:50] devil hates his church there's a reason
[1:56:52] why the devil hates his Pastor there's a
[1:56:54] reason why the devil hates his bride
[1:56:56] it's cuz he's done everything that he
[1:56:58] can Amen to take New Life Outreach out
[1:57:01] of existence amen but every trial and
[1:57:04] every situation and every problem amen

[1:57:09] stronger she don't get loud oh come on
[1:57:11] she don't get lazy she just gets more
[1:57:13] fervent you know why because you've been
[1:57:16] born by the Breath of God
[1:57:20] now let me say this if you're born by
[1:57:22] the word god watches over his word and
[1:57:25] God Reveals His word and his word must
[1:57:28] have the preeminence now watch a prophet
[1:57:31] then seeing a little minority group amen
[1:57:33] gathered out there under the inspiration
[1:57:35] of God producing again the life of Jesus
[1:57:39] Christ by the scriptures that's supposed
[1:57:41] to happen you know what hour you're
[1:57:44] living in he said what is it it's the
[1:57:46] word somebody say the word word join
[1:57:49] joining with the word it's the word
[1:57:52] joining with the word brother Kobe all
[1:57:55] that the father hath given me they will
[1:57:57] come to me amen the word joining with
[1:58:00] the word in other words amen you are not
[1:58:03] called by
[1:58:05] feeling you are not called by song you
[1:58:08] are not called by special preacher you
[1:58:10] are called by the word in other words
[1:58:13] the written word amen called out to the
[1:58:16] predestinated word that was in your soul
[1:58:19] the word is a written word but you are
[1:58:22] the predestinated word and when this
[1:58:24] word begins to call the only thing it
[1:58:27] can call is the word so you were not
[1:58:30] joined to a feeling you were not joined
[1:58:32] to an emotion you were not joined to a
[1:58:34] gift you were joined to the word then
[1:58:37] that's why that the word is your Victory
[1:58:40] that's why the word is your answer
[1:58:41] that's why the word is your power amen
[1:58:44] oh come on church are can I ask now now
[1:58:47] now let me just say this let me let me
[1:58:49] let me just slow down here and drop this
[1:58:50] in it's a very direct question okay is
[1:58:52] that okay brother wendle are we
[1:58:56] sufficiently impressed with the
[1:59:01] word are we sufficiently impressed with
[1:59:06] the word brother said Jesus knew there
[1:59:08] was going to be a terrible drift away
[1:59:09] from the word in the perg church age
[1:59:11] which was yet 200 years off from the
[1:59:13] Patmos Vision he knew the drift would
[1:59:16] cause him to go in Dark Ages he knew
[1:59:18] that was the way man AR is got from God
[1:59:20] was by first leaving the word if you
[1:59:22] leave that word you have left
[1:59:26] god plain and simple if you leave the
[1:59:29] word you have left God thus he has
[1:59:32] presented himself to the church at
[1:59:34] pergamus and indeed to all churches of
[1:59:36] all ages now here's what he's saying I
[1:59:39] am the word if you want deity in your
[1:59:42] midst then welcome and receive the word
[1:59:45] listen don't ever let anyone or anything
[1:59:48] get between you in that word this which
[1:59:50] I am giving you the word is a revelation
[1:59:53] of myself amen I am the word remember
[1:59:57] that then the prophet asked the question
[2:00:00] I wonder if we are sufficiently
[2:00:03] impressed with the word in our midst now
[2:00:06] notice he did not say are we
[2:00:08] sufficiently impressed with
[2:00:11] signs come on he said word although we
[2:00:15] believe in Signs Now you said brother
[2:00:17] why would he say word and not signs
[2:00:19] because signs can be impersonated but
[2:00:22] the word which is the opening of the
[2:00:25] word the third pull cannot be
[2:00:27] impersonated in 2 Thessalonians 2:8 Paul
[2:00:30] said then that shall the wicked be
[2:00:32] revealed now watch this whom the Lord
[2:00:35] shall consume with the spirit of his
[2:00:38] mouth and shall destroy with the
[2:00:41] brightness of his coming even him who's
[2:00:43] coming is after the working of Satan
[2:00:45] with all power and signs and line
[2:00:47] wonders now watch this the now now if
[2:00:50] you speak a word with your mouth amen
[2:00:52] what comes out of your mouth
[2:00:55] breath so here he's saying that the the
[2:00:58] wicked one is going to be revealed but
[2:01:01] the Lord will
[2:01:03] consume with the spirit of his mouth in
[2:01:06] other words the same breath that borne
[2:01:09] you destroys your
[2:01:12] enemy the same breath that breathed over
[2:01:15] the church and brought the revealing of
[2:01:18] the son of man into manifestation is the
[2:01:21] same breath that will consume the SP of
[2:01:23] predition the wicked one and will
[2:01:26] destroy him with the brightness of his
[2:01:28] coming brother when that word is refused
[2:01:31] amen then they are turned to their
[2:01:33] desires now let me say this the word is
[2:01:35] the
[2:01:37] truth the word is the truth and we are
[2:01:41] lovers of the word which makes us lovers
[2:01:44] of Truth now you say brother are you
[2:01:46] against signs I'm not against signs can
[2:01:48] we clear that that up I believe in
[2:01:52] signs the Bible speaks of signs in
[2:01:55] Exodus 7 the signs of Wonders were done
[2:01:56] the land of Egypt in Mark 16 Jesus said
[2:01:59] amen that sign shall follow them to
[2:02:01] believe in John 4 Jesus said you won't
[2:02:03] believe except you see signs and wonders
[2:02:05] now watch this the Bible instructs us
[2:02:08] Amen to try the spirits in other words
[2:02:10] we must give them the word test because
[2:02:13] there's a generation of sign Seekers
[2:02:15] that knows nothing more about the true
[2:02:17] move of God in his word in these last
[2:02:18] days brother said how can you tell them
[2:02:21] give them the word test how can you know
[2:02:23] it speak the word and see what they say
[2:02:25] about it if they don't believe the word
[2:02:28] they do not have the seed germ in them
[2:02:31] they are of the evil one and deceive you
[2:02:34] now can I can I say what the prophet
[2:02:35] said is that okay God never placed signs
[2:02:39] ahead of his word that's a scorcher he
[2:02:42] said God never Place signs ahead of his
[2:02:45] word they were added for the proof of
[2:02:47] the word but the word is first to prove
[2:02:50] it Elijah said to the woman bake me a
[2:02:53] cake first then watch the miracle happen
[2:02:56] remember said come to the word first
[2:02:58] then watch the miracle the seed word
[2:03:01] itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes
[2:03:04] can I say this to you the miracle takes
[2:03:07] place on the word brother said it very
[2:03:09] beautiful he said because the word is
[2:03:12] the seed that brings forth a miracle so
[2:03:15] how many believers do I have here today
[2:03:17] as a Believer you are Iden ified in Mark
[2:03:19] 16 as a part of the true church you are
[2:03:22] identified in Mark 16 and Mark 16 said
[2:03:26] amen that signs and wonders amen shall
[2:03:28] follow them that believe in other words
[2:03:32] amen they're not following signs and
[2:03:34] wonders come on Church the Believers are
[2:03:36] not following signs and wonders but
[2:03:39] signs and wonders are following the
[2:03:44] Believers we are not following signs and
[2:03:47] wonders but signs and wonders are
[2:03:50] following us I never will forget as a
[2:03:52] young kid at Louisiana Camp some of
[2:03:54] y'all probably remember brother Danny
[2:03:55] steeman preaching one time on Mark 16
[2:03:57] and he got two little boys he said now
[2:03:59] your signs and your wonders and he
[2:04:01] called them signs and wonders and he
[2:04:02] said now watch he said everywhere I go I
[2:04:05] want you to follow me cuz I'm a Believer
[2:04:07] and brother Danny just took off walking
[2:04:09] and brother Josh he never stopped and
[2:04:11] turned around and said are you there
[2:04:12] signs and wonders he never stopped and
[2:04:14] had a prayer meeting and S her signs and
[2:04:16] wonders there he said wherever I go as
[2:04:18] the believer signs and wonders follow me
[2:04:22] he said if I speed up then signs and
[2:04:24] wonders speed up if I slow down signs
[2:04:27] and wonders slow down I love this one he
[2:04:30] walked off the platform in the back room
[2:04:32] and he said if I walk into Dark Places
[2:04:34] amen signs and wonders follow me in the
[2:04:37] dark places because I am a believer oh
[2:04:41] Church of the Living God unclog the
[2:04:43] channel of inspiration in your soul and
[2:04:46] let a word move back in there and let a
[2:04:48] the word take preeminence then you'll
[2:04:50] see signs then you'll see wonders when
[2:04:53] the word has preeminence in your midst
[2:04:55] and you are sufficiently impressed with
[2:04:58] that
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:05:00] word now the prod of God said it very
[2:05:03] beautiful he said look at job he said
[2:05:05] when he couldn't now oh my I'm running
[2:05:07] out of time he said when he couldn't get
[2:05:08] a when he couldn't get a word from God
[2:05:10] he said the devil could not move
[2:05:14] him can I say this there's going to be
[2:05:16] times that you can't get a word
[2:05:19] we're human okay there's going to be
[2:05:22] times you can't pray hard enough to get
[2:05:24] it
[2:05:25] open going to be times you can't scream
[2:05:27] loud enough to get it open but you got
[2:05:29] to stand there as a word believer
[2:05:33] knowing who you are when you know you've
[2:05:36] done exactly what God told you to do see
[2:05:38] then wait for the channel of inspiration
[2:05:41] to open up to you now listen friends the
[2:05:43] reason we must have the word in our
[2:05:45] midst and let that word have preeminence
[2:05:47] is because of this the devil can
[2:05:50] impersonate signs to mislead the church
[2:05:53] away from the word but when you're
[2:05:55] Simeon and it's been revealed to you and
[2:05:58] you know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[2:06:00] I'm not going to die until I seen the
[2:06:03] Lord's Christ then there will be
[2:06:05] something in your soul that will bear
[2:06:07] record with the inspiration that
[2:06:10] revealed the promise to you that you
[2:06:12] will not accept anything except the
[2:06:14] clearly identified manifestation of the
[2:06:18] promised God gave you now can I say it
[2:06:20] like this how many days did Simeon as an
[2:06:23] old man wake up with pain in his back
[2:06:25] with stop shoulders with all kinds of
[2:06:28] problems and say Lord I wish today was
[2:06:30] the day I wish today was the day I would
[2:06:33] see that Christ child and I just go on
[2:06:35] home right amen and maybe he could go
[2:06:37] down the CH to the church and in walk a
[2:06:39] little girl amen if he was following
[2:06:41] signs and wonders the devil could have
[2:06:43] got in there and that little girl and
[2:06:46] said present that baby to Simeon and
[2:06:48] he'll accept it but because Simeon was a
[2:06:50] believer of the spiritual Revelation
[2:06:53] that was given to him by almighty God
[2:06:55] you could not trick Simeon into believe
[2:06:58] in anything that was contrary Amen to
[2:07:01] the revelation God had given him
[2:07:03] concerning his promise and bride of
[2:07:05] Jesus Christ we have come back to the
[2:07:08] headship of the word of almighty God
[2:07:10] then we will not accept any feeling we
[2:07:12] will not accept any gift we will not
[2:07:14] accept any impersonation that is
[2:07:16] contrary to the word of God to lead us
[2:07:19] away from the Vindicated revelation of
[2:07:22] the promise of the Rapture that is upon
[2:07:24] the church listen I believe we'll end to
[2:07:26] let ourselves move out of the way and
[2:07:29] let the word move
[2:07:32] in the Pro of God said the greatest
[2:07:34] enemy I gotten is William Brandon he's
[2:07:36] the one that gets in God's way he's the
[2:07:38] one that gets lazy he's the one that
[2:07:40] gets to a place sometimes where he
[2:07:41] thinks he can do something about it and
[2:07:43] when he does that shoves God right out
[2:07:45] of the picture but when I can get rid of
[2:07:47] that guy when I can get to the place
[2:07:49] he's out of the
[2:07:54] way then God can come in and do things
[2:07:58] William brandom knows nothing about
[2:08:01] that's when God can use you can I say
[2:08:05] this when we're out of the way the
[2:08:07] inspired word moves in and does things
[2:08:10] he said preach a gospel that can make
[2:08:12] people actually that was once
[2:08:13] bootleggers and gamblers and prostitutes
[2:08:15] everything else out on the street sit in
[2:08:17] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and can
[2:08:20] feel the inspiration of the spirit to
[2:08:22] rise you to a place till you lose
[2:08:25] yourself and scream out amen hallelujah
[2:08:29] praises to God that's a wonderful thing
[2:08:31] now why is that happening because the
[2:08:34] identified word is back in our midst and
[2:08:37] we're impressed by it and we're freshly
[2:08:41] inspired by it now can I say this to you
[2:08:43] can you give me second Timothy 3 verse
[2:08:45] 13 notice this in second Timothy 3:13
[2:08:48] now evil men and seducers shall wax
[2:08:50] worse and
[2:08:51] worse right deceiving and being deceived
[2:08:55] brother said before the weeks over this
[2:08:57] next week I'm going to preach much on
[2:08:59] these things of the dullness how that
[2:09:01] the world has blowed its poisonous
[2:09:04] breath into the face of the people
[2:09:07] that's got them deceived the world has
[2:09:10] blowed its poisonous breath in the face
[2:09:13] of the people and has got them deceived
[2:09:16] they think they're Christians many of
[2:09:17] them they're not Jesus spoke at this
[2:09:19] appointment here look at verse 14 but
[2:09:22] continue thou in the things which thou
[2:09:23] has learned and has been assured of no
[2:09:24] one of whom thou has learned them and
[2:09:26] that from a child thou has known the
[2:09:28] holy scriptures which are able to make
[2:09:30] thee wise un salvation through faith
[2:09:33] which is in Christ Jesus now look at
[2:09:34] verse 16 all scripture is given by
[2:09:39] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[2:09:41] Doctrine for Repro for correction for
[2:09:44] instruction in righteousness somebody
[2:09:47] say this with me all scripture all
[2:09:49] scripture now you're looking at that
[2:09:51] little threel word all and you're saying
[2:09:54] that couldn't have much of a meaning but
[2:09:55] brother Kobe I looked up the definition
[2:09:57] of all and it means each every any all
[2:10:01] the whole everyone all things
[2:10:04] everything so brother Duren I can say
[2:10:07] any Scripture is given by inspiration of
[2:10:09] God all scripture the whole scripture
[2:10:12] everything in the scripture all things
[2:10:14] contained in the scripture is given by
[2:10:17] the inspiration of god brother aren't
[2:10:19] you glad to know that Jesus said all
[2:10:22] scripture is inspired and not one bit of
[2:10:24] it can keep from being fulfilled when
[2:10:27] God speaks inspired word there's not one
[2:10:30] confusion there's not one bad Spirit
[2:10:33] there's not one negative idea that can
[2:10:35] defeat the Fulfillment of the inspired
[2:10:38] word of God y'all remember brother
[2:10:40] talked about the woman laying on her
[2:10:41] deathbed he said she was laying there
[2:10:43] dying and he said her son got a telegram
[2:10:45] your mama's dying hurry up and get home
[2:10:47] so brother Donald she she she laying
[2:10:49] there dying her son can't get home in
[2:10:51] time amen but a few weeks later he comes
[2:10:54] home and she's sitting in her chair and
[2:10:56] she's doing well and he walks in there
[2:10:58] and he says mama what's going on you
[2:10:59] were dying she said I was honey she said
[2:11:02] but the church come down here the Full
[2:11:04] Gospel Church in other words all
[2:11:11] scripture the Full Gospel Church that
[2:11:13] believed all the scripture any of the
[2:11:16] scripture everything in the scripture
[2:11:18] was inspired come down here and read
[2:11:21] Mark 16 over me and they prayed for me
[2:11:24] and God healed me he said M what are you
[2:11:26] talking about she said Woo glory to God
[2:11:29] Amen brother said he looked at her and
[2:11:30] said Mommy you're even acting like
[2:11:33] him she said well honey what are you
[2:11:35] talking about he said in the Seminary
[2:11:38] they Tau us that Mark 16 from the 9th
[2:11:41] verse on is uninspired now watch a
[2:11:45] prophet brother said that woman looked
[2:11:47] at him and said I was thinking if God
[2:11:49] could heal me with the uninspired
[2:11:55] word if God could heal me and raise me
[2:11:59] from the dead by the uninspired word
[2:12:02] then what could he really do with that
[2:12:05] that is really
[2:12:06] inspired and brother says very beautiful
[2:12:09] we have to believe all God's word is
[2:12:11] inspired it has all its right meanings
[2:12:14] and all the false conceptions of the
[2:12:16] earth which looks real and looks
[2:12:18] reasonable is only a perverted Act of
[2:12:20] the devil from the original plan of God
[2:12:24] that's why in the last days that God
[2:12:26] sent a prophet among the church to say
[2:12:28] these words that Mark 16 is just as
[2:12:32] inspired as John
[2:12:35] 3:16 John 3:16 John 3:16 but here's a
[2:12:40] prophet saying We Believe John 316 but
[2:12:43] let's go to Mark 16 let's go to John 14
[2:12:46] let's go to John 1613
[2:12:48] let's go beyond the uninspired
[2:12:51] understanding of a bunch of theologians
[2:12:53] that's trying to choke the church on
[2:12:55] traditions and Creeds and ritualistic
[2:12:58] ideas let's go into the inspired word
[2:13:01] where there's a healing where there's a
[2:13:03] liberty now brother Wendell he said Mark
[2:13:06] 16:9 from the ninth verse on is
[2:13:08] uninspired now you all know me I'm the
[2:13:11] guy that says why did they pick the
[2:13:12] ninth verse so brother Austin and I went
[2:13:15] and read the ninth verse and here's what
[2:13:17] it said when Jesus was risen early the
[2:13:20] first day of the week he appeared first
[2:13:23] to Mary Magdalene of whom he had cast
[2:13:26] Seven
[2:13:27] Devils then I found where the prophet of
[2:13:30] God said the son told the mama Mar Mark
[2:13:33] 16 from the ninth verse on is uninspired
[2:13:36] and it was put there by a false
[2:13:40] witness okay but in Mark 16:9 the Bible
[2:13:44] said Jesus was risen early on the first
[2:13:47] day of the week who he appeared to Mary
[2:13:51] Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven
[2:13:54] Devils so when he appeared on the
[2:13:57] resurrection morning he did not go to
[2:13:59] somebody that was there when the Devils
[2:14:02] was cast out of Mary he went to her
[2:14:05] herself come on church then Mark 169 is
[2:14:09] not a false witness it's a true witness
[2:14:12] of a woman who experienced amen the
[2:14:14] power of the one that was in the grave
[2:14:17] has just AIS out of the grave and she
[2:14:19] can stand there and say I know you
[2:14:22] because you were the one that cast Seven
[2:14:25] Devils out of me Church of the Living
[2:14:27] God I say there's an authority there's
[2:14:29] an inspiration the church that's why
[2:14:31] we're shouting that's why we're
[2:14:33] hollering is because when the God we
[2:14:35] read about walks in the building there
[2:14:37] is something in our soul that can bear
[2:14:39] record with him and say that's the god
[2:14:41] that saved me that's the god that healed
[2:14:44] me that's the god that delivered me
[2:14:46] that's the god that redeemed my baby
[2:14:47] babies that's the god that give me the
[2:14:49] Holy Ghost that's the god that saved my
[2:14:51] marriage that's the god that saved my
[2:14:53] testimony that's the god that saved me
[2:14:56] when everything was looking lost that's
[2:14:58] the god that came on the scene
[2:15:01] hall hallelujah we are freshly inspired
[2:15:06] by the Breath of
[2:15:07] [Applause]
[2:15:09] God now the word of the Lord comes to
[2:15:12] the prophet and the prophet said the
[2:15:14] prophet is a reflector of God's word now
[2:15:18] he cannot say his own
[2:15:21] thoughts brother Darren he can only
[2:15:23] speak what God
[2:15:29] reveals now in the last days there's a
[2:15:32] danger I'm I'm tying this
[2:15:35] up in the last days there's a danger you
[2:15:39] ready for this danger brother B called
[2:15:41] it uninspired
[2:15:44] leadership direct quote now look in
[2:15:48] Jeremiah can you give me Jeremiah
[2:15:50] 18:18 look at this
[2:15:52] verse then said they come and let us
[2:15:56] devise devices against Jeremiah for the
[2:15:59] law shall not perish from the priest nor
[2:16:01] counsel from the wise nor the word from
[2:16:04] the Prophet come and let us Smite with
[2:16:07] the
[2:16:09] tongue and let us not give heed to any
[2:16:13] of his
[2:16:16] words and other words that's just his
[2:16:24] opinion in other words that's just who
[2:16:27] he was talking to at a specific time it
[2:16:30] don't apply to this Bride come
[2:16:33] on are you hearing me in other words men
[2:16:37] were anointed to raise up and say ignore
[2:16:40] what Jeremiah said and the problem God
[2:16:42] said it's been always these time of
[2:16:43] group of leaders that gets the people
[2:16:45] all mixed up it's not so much the people
[2:16:48] it's the leaders that get them mixed up
[2:16:50] oh you say brother Brandon well now just
[2:16:52] a minute look here by their worldly
[2:16:54] words of wisdom in their by their words
[2:16:57] of wisdom in their uninspired leadership
[2:17:00] words of worldly
[2:17:03] wisdom so when they stand up and they
[2:17:06] begin to speak things contrary to what a
[2:17:09] prophet taught listen the Breath of God
[2:17:13] Amen is in a prophet and Men of God who
[2:17:16] are preaching what a prophet said are
[2:17:18] breathing over the church with the fresh
[2:17:21] breath of the immortal God the Creator
[2:17:24] but when men get in the pulpit and they
[2:17:27] start saying things and teaching things
[2:17:29] and pointing things in a different
[2:17:31] direction from what a prophet said watch
[2:17:33] what happened in Matthew 14 when the
[2:17:35] multitude sent away he went up on the
[2:17:36] mountain the park to pray and when the
[2:17:38] evening was come they was there alone
[2:17:39] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[2:17:42] sea and it was tossed with the waves
[2:17:44] amen for the wind was contrary so that
[2:17:47] same wind amen was the Breath of God
[2:17:50] that breathed in the beginning but now
[2:17:52] the devil has got in the wind and made
[2:17:54] the wind contrary and watch what a
[2:17:56] prophet said it's because Satan begin to
[2:17:59] push out his poison breath and has be to
[2:18:02] blow his WIS of strife amen breaking
[2:18:05] churches apart separating Brotherhood
[2:18:08] and making people think they're a little
[2:18:10] better than somebody else they belong in
[2:18:12] a better bracket they belong to a better
[2:18:14] Church listen there's only one church
[2:18:17] and that's the Church of Jesus Christ
[2:18:19] let me just go ahead and preach since
[2:18:20] I'm here because those breasts does not
[2:18:23] just blow universally they blow locally
[2:18:25] in a body and somebody gets in their
[2:18:28] mind that their kids are better than
[2:18:29] these kids and their kids shouldn't be a
[2:18:31] part of these kids and this family
[2:18:33] shouldn't fellowship with that family
[2:18:35] and before long the devil blows all
[2:18:37] across the church well come on church
[2:18:40] and the anointing ain't moving the same
[2:18:42] and the Liberty ain't fair and the Holy
[2:18:44] Ghost ain't moving and it's all because
[2:18:46] Satan got in the wind and begin to blow
[2:18:49] his poisonous breath and we got a little
[2:18:51] better idea of our kids or our family
[2:18:53] let me say this we are what we are by
[2:18:56] the grace of
[2:18:57] God and we need each other's Fellowship
[2:19:00] more now than we ever have before I
[2:19:03] think we ought to lay aside our worldly
[2:19:04] friendships and get some Godly
[2:19:06] friendships and get some Godly
[2:19:08] Fellowship come on I don't think our
[2:19:10] kids ought to have best friends on the
[2:19:12] sports team with a bunch of unbeliev and
[2:19:14] Leon Sans I think our kids best friends
[2:19:17] on be church kids that are following the
[2:19:19] same message under the same pillar
[2:19:24] of I don't think our kids ought to be
[2:19:26] somewhere else when something's going on
[2:19:28] with our young people in the house of
[2:19:29] God I think we ought to bind together as
[2:19:32] the body come on I might as well preach
[2:19:34] I'm here we ought to bind together as
[2:19:36] the body of Jesus Christ and let the
[2:19:38] liberty of God come back in the church
[2:19:40] again listen we are a family and Satan
[2:19:43] is doing everything he can to tear us
[2:19:45] apart and break us down and bind our
[2:19:48] hands I say oh God bow on this church
[2:19:51] until the wind of God breaks every
[2:19:53] stronghold destroys every shackle brings
[2:19:56] back love brings back Unity brings back
[2:20:03] Fellowship brother and you're getting
[2:20:04] way out there I'm not getting out there
[2:20:06] brother said when Satan seen the little
[2:20:07] Church Without Christ this is what he
[2:20:09] said this is my
[2:20:12] opportunity this is my time I'll teach
[2:20:16] them how to blaspheme
[2:20:20] see his poisonous breath is killing the
[2:20:26] word so your pastor stands up here and
[2:20:28] labors and labors and labors and
[2:20:32] labors and you go home and Satan comes
[2:20:35] to the
[2:20:36] house that's
[2:20:40] legalism that's old
[2:20:43] school don't nobody believe that no
[2:20:46] more
[2:20:48] that's unimportant we're Beyond
[2:20:55] Holiness we're beyond that kind of
[2:20:59] teaching well we might as well
[2:21:02] preach are we really or is the devil
[2:21:06] coming in and blowing his poisonous
[2:21:08] breath because somewhere we've changed
[2:21:13] filters on somewhere we changed filters
[2:21:17] y'all ever heard of this what happens in
[2:21:19] the natural happens in the spiritual
[2:21:21] y'all ever heard that y'all ever heard
[2:21:23] of this word the Clean Air
[2:21:26] Act you ever heard that Clean Air Act in
[2:21:30] the United States primary Federal air
[2:21:33] quality law it was intended to reduce
[2:21:36] and control air population Nationwide it
[2:21:40] was an act to improve to strengthen and
[2:21:43] accelerate programs for the prevention
[2:21:46] and the elimination
[2:21:47] of air
[2:21:49] pollution now brother brother Kobe I was
[2:21:52] reading this other day or thinking about
[2:21:53] this Clean Air Act and I got on my phone
[2:21:55] driving down the road and I like to
[2:21:57] wreck my truck I got on my phone and I
[2:21:59] looked up the Clean Air Act you know
[2:22:01] when this was initially
[2:22:04] inacted was
[2:22:07] 1963
[2:22:09] wow in
[2:22:11] 1963 they are initially enacting
[2:22:14] something called the Clean Air Act in
[2:22:16] other words the trying to improve the
[2:22:18] air quality in the nation it's at the
[2:22:21] same time that a prophet is opening the
[2:22:23] Seven Seals and he's saying this is the
[2:22:26] word and he's exposing the Antichrist
[2:22:29] he's exposing the Pale Horse the White
[2:22:31] Horse the red horse the black he's doing
[2:22:33] all these things and what he's trying to
[2:22:35] do is improve the air quality that's in
[2:22:37] the church because it's so polluted with
[2:22:40] this idea about the Rapture and this
[2:22:42] idea about water baptism and this idea
[2:22:44] about predestination so a prophet comes
[2:22:47] and says we now have a filter and it's
[2:22:49] the word of God and if you'll put it in
[2:22:52] your home if you'll put it in your
[2:22:53] church if you'll put it in your bapti
[2:22:55] distry if you'll put it in your Sunday
[2:22:57] school if you'll put it in your young
[2:22:59] people it'll improve the air they're
[2:23:01] breathing listen it'll eliminate
[2:23:03] pollution and they'll be able to breathe
[2:23:05] the same Clear fresh Immortal air that
[2:23:08] they breathe in the beginning but you
[2:23:09] know what you going have to do you got
[2:23:11] to get rid of your man-made
[2:23:16] filters and put a thinking man's filter
[2:23:19] in now watch this and the prophet said
[2:23:22] what am I saying I'm saying the word is
[2:23:26] in the
[2:23:27] bride completion of what he had in his
[2:23:30] mind now what are you saying brother
[2:23:32] Andrew I'm saying change your filters
[2:23:34] that's
[2:23:35] right
[2:23:38] hello true change your
[2:23:40] filter if you got a man-made filter and
[2:23:44] everything that's preached from the
[2:23:45] message goes to that filter it ain't
[2:23:46] going to get to
[2:23:48] you but if you'll change and left the
[2:23:51] Clean Air
[2:23:52] Act that's
[2:23:54] rightl come into your life now I might
[2:23:59] as well say it I honestly I think it's
[2:24:00] time to improve the air quality in our
[2:24:05] homes I do because nine times out of 10
[2:24:08] when you got brother W I hope I ain't
[2:24:10] making too big of a mess nine times out
[2:24:12] of 10 when you got poor air quality in
[2:24:14] the home you going to have poor air
[2:24:15] quality in the church that's
[2:24:19] right because no matter how hard the
[2:24:21] word is preached and how clear and how
[2:24:23] great and how powerful if there's no
[2:24:25] clean air in the home and it's a bunch
[2:24:28] of fussing and fight and so and so did
[2:24:30] this and so and so did that and this one
[2:24:32] thought this and they looked at me and
[2:24:33] they thought that and they said this and
[2:24:34] they text this and they sent this they
[2:24:37] sent that and they said this and they
[2:24:38] didn't look at me and they didn't invite
[2:24:42] me come on church and that's what you
[2:24:45] feed on and then the well the preachers
[2:24:47] said this and brother wendle said that
[2:24:48] and brother W said this and brother so
[2:24:49] and so said that and brother so and so
[2:24:50] preach that and I don't think that
[2:24:51] applies what do you think about that's
[2:24:53] the air quality of your home
[2:24:57] that's but when you change your
[2:25:00] filter you can have clean air in the
[2:25:02] home you can have clean air in the car
[2:25:05] you can have clean air in the church
[2:25:07] what are you saying I'm saying put the
[2:25:08] tapes back on in your
[2:25:11] home come on Church put the tapes back
[2:25:14] on in your car come on well I ain't got
[2:25:16] time you you know what makes me people
[2:25:17] say they ain't got Tim less and tapes
[2:25:19] but they're caught up on every
[2:25:22] podcast they got every podcast covered
[2:25:24] they got every they got every they got
[2:25:26] every mother's society and every
[2:25:28] father's hunting societ they got all
[2:25:29] that taken care of and the quality of
[2:25:32] air in their home is killing the life of
[2:25:34] God it's choking the Revival out I say
[2:25:37] oh God let us get a backbone and change
[2:25:40] the filters until the revival can burn
[2:25:42] in our home it can burn on our job it
[2:25:45] can burn in our car it can burn bur in
[2:25:47] our school it can burn in our church God
[2:25:49] let the heir of God come back in the
[2:25:51] church until it can
[2:25:53] [Applause]
[2:25:55] burn what are you saying Bel Andrew I'm
[2:25:57] saying it's time to burn
[2:26:00] again I'm saying it's time to burn
[2:26:03] again Lord you say brother Andre burn
[2:26:06] again brother BR said yes he said it's
[2:26:09] time to clear the carbon off the lamp
[2:26:12] and let the fire of
[2:26:14] God burn again
[2:26:17] brother Andrew what are you getting
[2:26:19] at if you can take the word as your
[2:26:23] filter brother B said now the breath and
[2:26:26] the spirit has become the same and she's
[2:26:28] uniting together ready for
[2:26:31] this bringing forth that same powerful
[2:26:35] blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back
[2:26:41] there
[2:26:42] he is she's manifesting the same Works
[2:26:45] he did back there
[2:26:47] is being manifested right here today the
[2:26:50] same thing in other words she has become
[2:26:57] he she's bone of his bone she's life of
[2:27:00] his life she's power of his power she is
[2:27:07] him watch a prophet in the Valley of the
[2:27:10] dry bones I'm closing on
[2:27:12] this somebody say bone of his bone bone
[2:27:15] of his bone life of his life of his life
[2:27:18] power of his power power of his power
[2:27:20] she is him she is him Ezekiel brother
[2:27:23] wend goes down and he looks at a big
[2:27:25] valley of dry bones been laying there
[2:27:29] for years there's no flesh there's no
[2:27:32] senu there's no muscle there's nothing
[2:27:35] but
[2:27:36] bones now if you all leave some bones
[2:27:39] out if you if you throw old deer carcass
[2:27:40] out and a little while Busters are going
[2:27:42] to fly in and they going to start
[2:27:44] picking apart everything and you know
[2:27:45] what brother ml one buster he going to
[2:27:47] get him a couple bones and he going to
[2:27:48] fly them over there another Buzzard
[2:27:50] going to get him some bones he going to
[2:27:51] fly them over
[2:27:52] there and before long you go okay we'll
[2:27:54] just say this way you got Jim and John
[2:27:56] in the valley of dry bones Jim's got a
[2:27:58] leg bone Jim's got a backbone Jim's got
[2:28:00] a neckbone right John's got a leg bone
[2:28:03] John's got a backbone John's got a
[2:28:05] John's got a neckbone are you hear me
[2:28:08] but let a buzzard get in there and he
[2:28:10] might take Jim's neckbone over there and
[2:28:12] take John's leg bone over there and take
[2:28:14] John's neckbone over there and for long
[2:28:17] it's a valley and they're all spread out
[2:28:18] all over the place but when Ezekiel
[2:28:21] looked at this valley of dry bones he
[2:28:23] asked this question can this church I
[2:28:25] mean can these bones live again can they
[2:28:29] live again can this bride live again can
[2:28:32] this can this can this bride live again
[2:28:34] Lord I'm looking at her she's scattered
[2:28:37] all across here can she live again a
[2:28:39] prophet looking at can the bride live
[2:28:41] again now watch so I prophesied as I was
[2:28:43] commanded and as I prophesied there was
[2:28:46] was a noise and behold a shaking and the
[2:28:50] bones came together now watch this not
[2:28:53] bone to bone but bone to his
[2:28:57] bone so Jim didn't get John's neck bone
[2:29:01] and John get Jim's leg bone but when the
[2:29:03] Breath of God hallelujah when the Breath
[2:29:06] of God breathed across that Valley it
[2:29:09] had the power to restore to the original
[2:29:12] condition with the original qualities
[2:29:15] and John got his leg bone and John got
[2:29:18] his backbone and John got his neck bone
[2:29:20] and Jim got his leg bone and Jim got his
[2:29:23] neckbone and Jim got his back are you
[2:29:25] hearing me listen bone to his bone and
[2:29:27] the brother God said then what is that
[2:29:29] fourth stage he said it is the wind of
[2:29:31] God it is the message of Life what's it
[2:29:34] doing the pyramid will stand again the
[2:29:37] house of God will live again let me say
[2:29:40] this new life when God begins to breathe
[2:29:42] across your Valley amen you're not going
[2:29:44] to get so and so's testimony and so and
[2:29:46] so's joy and so and so's Victory amen
[2:29:49] but everything you lost when the wind of
[2:29:52] God begins to breathe across the valley

[2:30:02] to get your anointing back you're going
[2:30:04] to get your Liberty back listen church I
[2:30:06] think it's time to let the Breath of God
[2:30:08] breathe across the church again until we
[2:30:11] get our praise back until we get our
[2:30:13] testimony back until we get our boldness
[2:30:15] back until we get our Liberty
[2:30:19] back God has provided a
[2:30:24] way listen people can I leave you at

[2:42:45] studying an animal we did all this study
[2:42:48] on it and we got done and the teacher
[2:42:51] said the sad thing about it is the
[2:42:54] animals extinct no longer
[2:42:57] exist and I said no longer
[2:43:00] exist how could that
[2:43:02] be he said because pollution and things
[2:43:06] killed its environment killed the
[2:43:08] atmosphere and it went
[2:43:10] extinct and I thought if that's in the
[2:43:13] natural no wonder Satan want to fill our
[2:43:16] homes fill our churches fill our young
[2:43:20] people with polluted air that's right
[2:43:23] because he wants this praise to go

[2:43:29] to become
[2:43:30] extinct but how many can say today Lord
[2:43:33] as for me in my home this filter is
