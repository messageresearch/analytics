[27:35] right and um and so we we want that we

[31:36] it makes you it makes you uh want to

[31:58] service tonight now uh we've had a few
[32:01] questions come in over since last
[32:03] Wednesday night about um um just just
[32:07] questions that people are embarrassed to
[32:09] ask um about in front of everybody
[32:12] thinking that they're stupid questions
[32:14] and and uh um but there's no stupid
[32:18] questions at all uh when it comes to the
[32:21] gospel you you ain't going to know
[32:24] unless you ask you know and so um but so
[32:28] we're just going to I'm going to start
[32:29] off with a with a question here tonight
[32:32] um and um uh it says how could the Beast
[32:37] uh um Talk Eve or convince Eve to sin if
[32:42] the Beast wasn't the devil and uh in
[32:45] other words how could the Beast have
[32:46] such knowledge and so um and I think
[32:50] that's a that's a good question and I
[32:52] first of all want to say that that God
[32:55] put the human being he put Adam and Eve
[32:58] his sons and daughters on the earth with
[33:02] a um with a free moral agency as a free
[33:06] moral agency so they had the ability to
[33:09] act as God and to choose they they they
[33:13] had the right they had the ability
[33:15] within themselves to say yes or to say
[33:18] no and and so their conscience was there
[33:23] that that dictates to them now animals
[33:26] do not have a soul
[33:28] and so um therefore they cannot choose
[33:31] between right and wrong an animal you
[33:34] can you can you can teach a dog to um
[33:38] fetch sit roll over you can teach uh you
[33:42] can teach you know bears you can teach
[33:45] uh elephants you can teach all but they
[33:48] uh and and and that's they you're you're
[33:50] able to teach them so far but an animal
[33:54] does not know right or wrong
[33:58] they they they they have they have no
[34:00] they don't know they're naked they don't
[34:02] know uh they they have no morals about
[34:05] them because uh they are they are an
[34:09] animal and so um but the Beast the Beast
[34:14] was different because the Beast had a
[34:17] place for a soul right Satan has a soul
[34:23] and so Satan comes amen and and and and
[34:29] moves inside this beast and is able to
[34:34] communicate these Facts of Life able to
[34:38] um amen bring this this sin before them
[34:42] so the beast in itself did not it it
[34:47] amen it it wasn't that the um that that
[34:52] the Beast was anointed amen I'll just
[34:55] put it that way the Beast the the he was
[34:58] he he was inhabited by the Devil Himself
[35:02] he moved inside them and the prophet
[35:05] would say he changed the serpent in
[35:07] every way that it had to that had to be
[35:10] done that would confuse this generation
[35:12] who's trying to find bone that looks
[35:16] some kind like some kind of an animal
[35:17] that was part of Man part part animal to
[35:20] say there's where man they've lost it
[35:24] from the chimpanzee only the chimpanzee
[35:27] doesn't have an intelligence the
[35:29] chimpanzee does not have a soul has not
[35:31] a soul he cannot think he's now just a
[35:35] noise or a horse can ghee hul and and
[35:39] something like that dog come here pH o
[35:42] do a trick jump over these and setting
[35:45] blocks up and things uh that by emotion
[35:48] and hearing and things like that and
[35:50] action uh but to think and to understand
[35:53] they can't they they don't know they're
[35:56] naked they don't know the male and the
[35:58] female the difference like that they
[36:00] have no laws of such human beings is the
[36:03] only one and the next one to the human
[36:06] being was The Serpent and the Bible said
[36:09] he was the most subtle of all the Beast
[36:12] of the field smarter he had almost had a
[36:15] se he had a place for a se but what did
[36:17] he do he sold out to Satan to deceive or
[36:22] to try to deceive God Amen and then he
[36:26] asked the question now how how many he
[36:27] gets that this far and so here here the
[36:31] serpent is here the the serpent is he's
[36:35] not a reptile now he's not hanging on a
[36:37] tree like people say the Bible says that
[36:40] he he went to his belly after the curse
[36:45] he went on his belly afterwards amen
[36:48] stripped him of his legs stripped him of
[36:50] his arms the Bible says amen if you want
[36:53] to if you want to look at it there in in
[36:54] Genesis 3 and 1 now this the serpent was
[36:58] more subtle than any reptile in the
[37:03] garden no no he was more subtle than any
[37:09] beast of the
[37:11] field which God had made and he the
[37:15] serpent said so this serpent could talk
[37:20] right amen and and he said You shall not
[37:23] eat asking the question hey you you're
[37:25] not supposed to eat he's beginning to
[37:27] reason with her he's beginning to talk
[37:30] and the woman answered back to the
[37:32] serpent so now amen so so she's not
[37:36] answering to a talking snake she is
[37:39] answering to a being that looked very
[37:43] much like a man amen he was very much
[37:46] man and so so we so I want you to
[37:50] understand that now because Satan uh had
[37:54] had had now entered into this serpent
[37:58] now brother brandham would say and and
[38:01] and and we will um and and just for
[38:04] those of you that might want to uh that
[38:07] that might be asking does you said the
[38:09] devil had a soul amen and brother bradam
[38:12] did say he said um he says there's a
[38:15] requirement for sin the requirement was
[38:17] death death was the penalty we go into
[38:19] great details of this because I do not
[38:21] believe that there is one but there is
[38:24] but one death there is one life I
[38:27] believe a man that has eternal life can
[38:30] never die I believe there is complete
[38:32] annihilation of that soul that sins for
[38:34] the Bible said the soul that sinth it
[38:37] shall surely die not the man the soul
[38:39] that sinth so Satan must surely die to
[38:43] be completely
[38:45] annihilated how I disagree with the
[38:47] Universalist that said Satan will be
[38:49] saved he sinned he's the originator of
[38:52] sin his soul sinned and he was a spirit
[38:56] and that's Spirit shall be totally
[38:59] annihilated uh to be nothing left of it
[39:02] so so before we move to the next
[39:04] question the first question was how
[39:06] could how could that Beast amen made in
[39:10] the Perfection of God or made in When
[39:13] God says that it was all things were
[39:15] good how could that be well amen Satan
[39:20] found an opportunity to possess that
[39:24] serpent amen none of the animals life
[39:26] had a so but this one here had a place
[39:29] and Satan come in found that place amen
[39:32] and there's where there's where s now
[39:35] now listen it whatever took place
[39:38] whatever that serpent done has now
[39:40] become synonymous with the
[39:42] devil any time that God anytime that
[39:44] God's dealing with the devil he calls
[39:46] him that old serpent that's right that
[39:48] old serpent the devil that old serpent
[39:50] the he's he's one he's one and the same
[39:53] because he he he became uh uh he was is
[39:57] United together can you say Amen another
[40:00] question was how did the devil end up in
[40:02] the garden and and the question is well
[40:06] he was kicked out of heaven uh because
[40:09] of sin and so uh uh that's that's how he
[40:14] ended up in the garden now I think the
[40:16] question is probably a little bit more
[40:17] direct how did God allow that Devil
[40:22] Inside the garden to talk to Eve in the
[40:25] first place and um
[40:28] um I I I believe that uh you know first
[40:32] of all that God's God's got a big plan
[40:34] God knew what was going to take place at
[40:36] the beginning and God also knew how many
[40:39] knows that God knew what Satan was going
[40:41] to
[40:42] do Satan didn't pull anything over on
[40:44] God Satan God knew exactly what was
[40:47] going to take place God's Eternal God
[40:50] never has a new thought God knew you God
[40:53] knew this service God knew every time
[40:56] you you you'd raise your hand in the
[40:57] service or every time that you would
[40:59] burp amen he he there is not a thing on
[41:04] this Earth that God does not
[41:08] know God knew the fall before the fall
[41:11] got here can you say Amen so amen but I
[41:14] want I want us to look why how how did
[41:16] God how did the devil end up here on the
[41:18] earth amen there're in Isaiah 14 and 12
[41:22] and and you can you can write these down
[41:24] uh I I've got I've got about seven or
[41:26] eight these questions here and so I'm
[41:28] going to just take a little bit of time
[41:30] um he says um Isaiah 14:12 how art thou
[41:34] fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[41:37] morning how art thou cut down to the
[41:40] ground which this weakens the Nations
[41:43] for thou H has said in thine heart now
[41:47] when when you start talking in your
[41:48] heart and you've got a pride issue amen
[41:52] you you you've got to remember when
[41:53] pride comes before the fall so when you
[41:56] start exalting yourself just remember
[41:58] God's going to put you down amen and and
[42:02] God will make you can God will share his
[42:06] glory with no
[42:07] man he's the good one and you're just
[42:10] the one that he's anointing he's the one
[42:12] you're the one that he has called that
[42:14] that he can work through can you say
[42:16] Amen now I want you to watch this what
[42:17] watch his attitude thou said in thine
[42:19] heart I will Ascend into uh into heaven
[42:24] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[42:26] of God God I will sit upon also upon the
[42:30] Mount of the congregation and the signs
[42:32] of the north I will Ascend above uh the
[42:36] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[42:39] most high God yet thou sh be brought
[42:42] down to Hell to the sides of the pit so
[42:46] so what caused him what what caused him
[42:50] to be cast out of heaven in the first
[42:51] place it was his pride amen it was that
[42:55] pride in him that was that that was
[42:57] causing him to uh that lifting himself
[43:02] up above God Amen lifting himself up
[43:05] seeing himself in a little bit different
[43:08] light than what maybe God seen him as
[43:11] amen and you got to and we we've all got
[43:13] to be careful amen don't don't let me go
[43:16] through life uh and me the only one
[43:19] thinking what I'm thinking of myself
[43:22] amen let let me go through life making
[43:24] sure that uh we're all thinking about
[43:26] the same same can you say
[43:28] Amen we don't want to go through life
[43:31] with our heads in the clouds and
[43:32] thinking that we are just right next to
[43:34] God and um maybe maybe God doesn't think
[43:37] that way now so pride is going to will
[43:40] will will cause you to to to lose now
[43:44] let's look real quickly Ezekiel 28:12
[43:47] let's look a little bit about this about
[43:49] this uh about Satan Lucifer now first of
[43:52] all uh as you're turning there Luke or
[43:55] Ezekiel 20 and2 he Lucifer was the son
[43:58] of the morning he was the angel of Light
[44:02] amen he was the angel of Light he was a
[44:05] cherub them and the cherubs were the
[44:08] ones they were the throne guards they
[44:10] were the ones that were took that took
[44:13] uh special CU they never left the throne
[44:15] they were right there with with the
[44:19] master amen and and so let let's look
[44:22] here uh in the 12th verse son of man
[44:25] take a lamentation upon the king of
[44:27] Tyrus and say unto him thus sayith the
[44:31] Lord God thou seest up the uh up the sum
[44:35] full of wisdom perfect in Beauty thou
[44:38] Hast been in Garden or in Eden the
[44:40] Garden of God now I want I want to say
[44:42] right here we know that the king Tyrus
[44:45] could not have been an Eden at that time
[44:48] uh uh Eden was 4,000 uh years before but
[44:52] God was talking to the devil that was in
[44:56] that man right amen and so so yes king
[45:00] the king of Tyrus was uh you know he he
[45:03] wasn't back there in the garden but God
[45:06] was dealing with that devil that that
[45:08] had possessed that man that's what the
[45:09] prophet said amen and so and then it
[45:12] goes on it says every precious stone was
[45:15] thy covering the the sardus the topaz
[45:17] the diamond the burill Onyx The Jasper
[45:21] the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle
[45:24] uh the gold the the workmanship of thy
[45:26] tab
[45:27] and thy pipes were prepared in thee in
[45:29] the day that thou was created Thou Art
[45:33] the anointed cherub that
[45:39] coverthe cherub that
[45:42] coverthe set thee so thou was upon the
[45:46] holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up
[45:49] and down in the midst of the stones of
[45:51] fire thou was perfect in thy ways from
[45:55] the day that thou was created created
[45:57] till iniquity was found in thee and by
[46:01] the multitude of thy merchandise they
[46:03] have filled the midst of thee with
[46:05] violence and thou Hast sinned therefore
[46:08] I have cast thee as profane out of the
[46:11] Mountain of God and I will destroy the
[46:13] old covering cherub the m in the from
[46:16] the midst of the stones of the fire
[46:18] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[46:23] Beauty and thou Hast corrupted thy
[46:26] wisdom
[46:27] by reason of thy brightness now now I
[46:32] want you to really catch pride pride if
[46:36] there's anything that the human being
[46:38] has got to fight and that's
[46:42] pride pride comes from the master of all
[46:48] Devils Lucifer
[46:51] himself is the originator of Pride right
[46:56] and so so pride pride is something that
[47:00] I believe that we should be watching
[47:03] with everything we've got to keep a
[47:07] proud spirit away from us amen and I
[47:12] want to tell you you can't tell me I I
[47:15] mean I I'm here to tell you I this old
[47:17] fat bald man will look in the mirror and
[47:19] sometimes think you know you're not bad
[47:20] looking Hallelujah Pride will you Pride
[47:24] will will ease up on any of
[47:29] us he'll do it to all of you musicians
[47:32] Amen to where you just get to thinking
[47:34] that man you've got life by the tail
[47:36] right you he'll do it to you uh uh song
[47:39] leaders preachers he'll do it to every
[47:42] one of us come on how many's ever had to
[47:44] fight pride in your life amen we we all
[47:48] have to battle that but now remember it
[47:53] defiled the
[47:54] sanctuary and God kicked him out amen
[47:59] and he says I will cast you to the
[48:01] ground now if if if you and of course we
[48:06] understand that there in in Revelations
[48:08] 12:7 that there was a war in heaven and
[48:12] Michael and his angels fought against
[48:15] the
[48:16] dragon and and and fought uh and his
[48:19] angels and the dragon fought and his
[48:21] angels and prevailed not neither was
[48:23] there a place uh anymore in the heaven
[48:27] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[48:29] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[48:32] which deceiveth the whole world and he
[48:34] was cast out into the Earth and his
[48:37] angels were cast out with him sir so so
[48:41] all of the trouble we have here on the
[48:43] Earth was because there was a sin that
[48:47] took place in heaven so the first sin
[48:50] was not in the Garden of Eden the first
[48:52] sin was in heaven and it was a pride
[48:57] issue by a a talented a talented uh uh
[49:02] angel that God had put to his I mean God
[49:06] had put him right next to him and said
[49:10] you stay right here by my throne and you
[49:12] you you I'm I'm putting I he he exalted
[49:16] this this this Angel and this Angel
[49:21] begin to look at himself as if ha my
[49:24] position is great and then he looked
[49:27] over at Michael and he says I think my
[49:29] position is even greater than yours and
[49:32] then before you know it there's this
[49:34] battle that is going on and there's a
[49:36] fight is going on and then there's a
[49:38] power struggle in the church right the
[49:42] first Power struggle did not happen in
[49:44] the garden the first happened in God's
[49:47] Own Church in his
[49:49] Sanctuary
[49:50] amen so so power struggles amen is is
[49:55] what calls the first sin and so we want
[49:59] to remain humble
[50:02] amen now why would God allow uh um why
[50:08] would god let's see it sound like the
[50:10] same question uh how did the devil end
[50:12] up in the garden then then there was
[50:14] another one why would God even allow
[50:16] Satan in the garden and and so and I
[50:20] think I answered that while ago because
[50:22] God's got a law a great law of contrast
[50:26] and so amen uh God God is a god of many
[50:30] attributes and God also had Divine
[50:32] knowledge pre- knowledge of what was
[50:34] going to take place and so the attribute
[50:37] of healer can only come from someone who
[50:39] has fallen and and needs healing amen
[50:42] the the Divine attribute of forgiveness
[50:45] can only come for somebody that has
[50:46] sinned the Divine attribute of Savior
[50:49] can only be for for one that uh and that
[50:53] has sinned so God allowed it yes God
[50:56] could have stopped it but God in his
[50:59] Divine wisdom and his Divine
[51:01] intelligence knew what was going to take
[51:03] place and so God allowed that amen is
[51:07] everyone is everyone okay with
[51:09] that now amen so so another one was
[51:14] there were two trees in the Garden of
[51:16] Eden uh in the midst of the garden right
[51:19] the Tree of Life from the Tree of
[51:21] knowledge of Good and Evil amen were
[51:24] they not allowed to eat of the tree of n
[51:26] of Life uh either if so why and so uh
[51:31] there in Genesis 2
[51:33] and6 would just read this here together
[51:36] and and now if you uh I am glad to see
[51:39] some some uh some of y'all taking notes
[51:43] um I want youall to get I want youall to
[51:45] catch us and then afterwards um I've
[51:47] also got some of these um
[51:50] booklets uh little booklets I'd like to
[51:53] hand to to uh you young people that's
[51:57] that's old enough to read them and and
[51:58] appreciate them so I've got some of
[52:00] those here if you don't have these these
[52:01] booklets I want I want youall to get get
[52:03] one of these um brother Tim I put this
[52:06] out and um I where where did you where
[52:10] did you come up where did you find
[52:23] that
[52:25] okay
[52:27] okay well good well good I'm I'm I I I I
[52:31] couldn't I couldn't quite make it out in
[52:32] the text whether or not she was on my
[52:34] side
[52:36] or yeah yeah well that's pretty good
[52:40] amen okay so uh uh Genesis 2:16 it says
[52:45] and the Lord God commanded the man
[52:47] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[52:50] mayest eat freely but of the tree of the
[52:53] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[52:56] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[52:59] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so
[53:03] the tree of life was in the midst of the
[53:06] garden now God did separate them God did
[53:09] separate these two trees to let you know
[53:12] you know as we read as we read last week
[53:15] all of the trees in the garden is is is
[53:18] good for food and also God and God put
[53:23] also the tree of life and the tree of
[53:25] knowledge so he's letting them know that
[53:28] these are not they're not the these are
[53:30] not just natural fruit trees but these
[53:33] are spiritual trees amen and one was the
[53:37] Tree of Life which was the word of God
[53:41] it was Christ himself the logos God and
[53:45] then there was also uh uh Satan and
[53:49] these Spirits were there these these
[53:52] anointed ones were there to uh uh uh in
[53:58] relation brother Brandon would say as we
[53:59] read in the church age book last week he
[54:01] said now this the reason that these two
[54:03] trees were put there they they were
[54:05] there in direct relation with with Adam
[54:09] and Eve God's children and so I think
[54:11] you guys were not going to have to go
[54:13] through that here tonight everybody
[54:15] understand so the tree of life is what
[54:17] they were supposed to take up they were
[54:19] supposed to partake of God's word and
[54:22] God's word
[54:24] alone that's what they were supposed to
[54:26] take that was the tree of life but when
[54:29] you refuse the tree of life and you you
[54:32] accept knowledge over the tree of life
[54:36] and once again amen knowledge can never
[54:40] take the place of the experience of Life
[54:44] it'll never take knowledge cannot we're
[54:47] thankful for knowledge and we grow in
[54:49] knowledge but knowledge there will come
[54:52] a time where all of your knowledge if
[54:54] you live long enough to can just take
[54:57] all of that totally away that's right
[54:59] and if you're not on the tree of life
[55:01] you're in trouble that's right you you
[55:04] you you you you get to the all of that
[55:07] knowledge that you love right now and I
[55:09] love seeing these young men uh and and
[55:11] these young women and and all of the the
[55:14] the man I how I oh how I could love to
[55:17] just be that young again and and
[55:19] vigorous and and full of energy and
[55:21] learning things and and and like that
[55:23] again amen but I'm on this side of the
[55:26] spum now and and and and I'm having to
[55:29] rely on the tree of life more than I
[55:32] ever have amen all right praise the Lord
[55:36] all right so another question God
[55:39] created two of everything
[55:41] right so were there more than one Beast
[55:45] that got cursed now that's a good
[55:49] question and uh uh I I would say
[55:55] maybe and then I would
[55:59] say
[56:01] yes because the the the curse totally
[56:04] took out that link so so what we don't
[56:08] know whether or not this was a special
[56:10] this was a special Beast that was
[56:14] created for a special purpose we we
[56:18] don't know we don't we we we we don't
[56:20] know if that but I guarantee you if that
[56:23] if that Beast had a
[56:25] mate
[56:28] she wasn't proud of her
[56:31] man I guarantee you
[56:37] that going on your belly the rest of
[56:39] your life is not is is is is not a not a
[56:42] good thing amen so um but I I would I
[56:47] would say I I would I I I sort of lean
[56:51] toward the the thought that this was
[56:53] this was a prepared this was a prep
[56:56] prepared um a beast just as the whale
[57:00] was a prepared fish now that's just my
[57:04] opinion I can't I I I I I don't I I
[57:07] don't know and I there wasn't anything
[57:09] that I could find uh in the message on
[57:12] that um and if you do find something
[57:15] else on that give that to me I I want to
[57:18] put that in my Arsenal praise the Lord
[57:21] so um okay so the another question was
[57:25] and how many how many appreciates these
[57:27] questions I appreciate all of these
[57:29] questions cuz
[57:31] it's I I think it's good for us all uh
[57:34] uh uh uh to to partake of and think of
[57:37] the next one is is why did the bible say
[57:41] that Cain came from the Lord and so um
[57:46] and I think I think the the scripture
[57:47] that is being used here if we go to
[57:49] Genesis 4 And1 sister Keys um and and
[57:54] now this is now those that are just
[57:56] coming in for for T night's service you
[57:59] you missed last Wednesday night and so
[58:01] we're just sort of picking up some
[58:03] questions from that came from last
[58:05] Wednesday night um but Genesis 4 and one
[58:08] Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived
[58:13] and bear Cain and said I have gotten a
[58:18] man uh from the Lord
[58:21] now now
[58:23] we um let let me turn there
[58:30] amen uh and and she be and she again
[58:34] bear his brother Abel and Abel was a
[58:37] keeper of the ground but Cain was a
[58:40] tiller of the ground so so I want you to
[58:43] look at this one one one time Adam knew
[58:47] his wife one act and then in the same
[58:51] and then in within those verses She bear
[58:53] Cain and she also bear able now but she
[58:58] specifically said um I have gotten a man
[59:02] from the Lord now here's what here's
[59:05] what the prophet said you you says now
[59:07] the question is Eve said I have gotten a
[59:09] man from the Lord that's exactly right
[59:12] you could take the Orest woman in the
[59:14] town the worst man and if they have the
[59:16] baby a baby it would have to come from
[59:19] the Lord because God has set laws has
[59:22] laws set together and of these laws like
[59:25] the son to raise you put a caber in a
[59:28] good field it'll grow it has to grow
[59:31] because it's God's law and when seed is
[59:35] planted it must grow and nothing can
[59:38] grow life but God because it operates
[59:43] under his laws now I thought that was a
[59:45] good
[59:46] explanation that's a good explanation so
[59:49] that that life now now now Satan had
[59:53] sold his seed into the womb of of Eve
[59:58] but it was and and and but it was it was
[1:00:01] uh uh but God is the one that gave the
[1:00:05] life amen so God is the one that gets
[1:00:09] gives the life now now here's another
[1:00:12] one that I thought I would bring in and
[1:00:13] and he and he's talks he's talking about
[1:00:15] the a deceived church and and he he says
[1:00:18] now when evil seed was planted into the
[1:00:21] womb of Eve it had it had to bring forth
[1:00:23] because it's God's law of reproduction
[1:00:26] it could do nothing else but bring it it
[1:00:28] had to come from God and when the church
[1:00:30] gets away from the word it will believe
[1:00:34] anything it is like Eve when Cain was
[1:00:37] born she said I've gotten a man from the
[1:00:38] Lord now do you realize that she really
[1:00:41] meant that she thought that she had a
[1:00:44] man from the Lord you see once she had
[1:00:46] been deceived by taking the word of
[1:00:49] Satan instead of the word of God she
[1:00:52] then thought that whatever she said was
[1:00:57] right now think about that tree of
[1:01:00] Knowledge Tree of Life and once she
[1:01:04] partook of this knowledge she truly
[1:01:07] truly believed that she had more
[1:01:11] understanding than that that was on the
[1:01:13] tree of life right it's amazing how the
[1:01:18] tree of knowledge thinks that it's so
[1:01:21] much higher than the word of God come on
[1:01:25] right see and the knowledge it was the
[1:01:28] knowledge that puffs up it was the
[1:01:30] knowledge that caused her to be deceived
[1:01:33] in the first place to think that she had
[1:01:36] something greater and that God was
[1:01:38] trying to keep her from that and and
[1:01:41] trying to keep her subordinate and and
[1:01:43] when when the serpent had said God knows
[1:01:46] in the day that you eat of this that
[1:01:49] you're going to be wise like him and
[1:01:50] he's he don't want you and she goes oh
[1:01:53] really give me to eat see
[1:01:56] and so so that's the way it is so he
[1:01:58] says if she said that she had a man from
[1:02:00] God then she had a man from God that's
[1:02:02] the way she believed it but God had set
[1:02:05] laws in his Universe a good seed can
[1:02:07] only bring forth good fruit an evil seed
[1:02:09] can only bring forth evil fruit now each
[1:02:12] seed though different will utilize the
[1:02:14] same Earth nourishment moisture Sunshine
[1:02:16] but it will bring forth after its own
[1:02:18] kind notice the history of Cain the Cain
[1:02:22] line and then notice the history of the
[1:02:24] Seth line only one difference between
[1:02:25] them The Original Seed nothing else amen
[1:02:30] all right another another question um
[1:02:33] where in the Bible does it say The
[1:02:36] Serpent is Cain's father well I think
[1:02:40] that's a good question and um how many
[1:02:43] can tell me is that does anyone know
[1:02:45] where that one's found out where it says
[1:02:48] that that
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:51] uh that Cain was the seed of the
[1:02:54] devil
[1:02:56] any any of you
[1:02:59] youngans all right uh uh first let's
[1:03:02] look here at first first John uh
[1:03:06] three and
[1:03:10] um let's see uh 1 John 3
[1:03:15] and
[1:03:17] 12 it says not as
[1:03:20] Cain who was of that Wicked
[1:03:24] one and slew uh his brother and
[1:03:28] wherefore slew he him because his own
[1:03:31] Works were evil and his brother's Works
[1:03:34] were righteous so so Cain had the had
[1:03:40] the beastly knowledge uh uh uh
[1:03:44] characteristics of his
[1:03:46] father the serpent the devil can you say
[1:03:50] Amen so so when when you when you look
[1:03:54] at it look you know Ju Just just look
[1:03:56] real quickly at at just think here just
[1:03:59] quickly as we as we think about this the
[1:04:01] fruit of the serpent compared to the
[1:04:03] fruit of
[1:04:05] Adam um and and if you were to look
[1:04:07] there in Genesis the I believe it's
[1:04:09] Genesis the 4th
[1:04:11] chapter um Genesis the 4th chapter it it
[1:04:16] deals it it deals um
[1:04:19] uh you know from the sixth verse on down
[1:04:23] talks about how that that God the the
[1:04:25] Cain's offering was not accepted Cain
[1:04:28] got all rebellious and and mad and and
[1:04:32] you you read that you you read uh those
[1:04:36] characteristics he he was uh uh he was
[1:04:40] belligerent he was rebellious he was
[1:04:43] defiant against God he murdered his half
[1:04:46] brother he he lied he lied right in the
[1:04:51] face of almighty God he he was uh uh
[1:04:57] totally unhuman likee in in his
[1:05:02] characteristics he was he Cain Cain did
[1:05:06] not even show the the slightest bit
[1:05:10] resemblance of Adam that's right Adam
[1:05:13] was the direct descendant from
[1:05:16] God Cain was The Descendant from the
[1:05:20] serpent the evil one the
[1:05:24] devil and so those
[1:05:27] characteristics just out out in him just
[1:05:30] just coming out in him and and and so um
[1:05:34] um and and and and brother Bram uh would
[1:05:37] would always point back to this areas
[1:05:39] too and if you were to if you were to go
[1:05:41] on down
[1:05:43] um uh you know uh uh the 16th verse and
[1:05:47] it it goes on down and it talks about
[1:05:49] how that uh uh he he was came went out
[1:05:52] from the presence of the Lord did you
[1:05:54] know that the first marking of the Beast
[1:05:57] was
[1:05:58] Cain Cain was
[1:06:01] marked that because of his beastly
[1:06:05] nature he was marked by God right and
[1:06:08] then you talk about the mark of the
[1:06:10] beast at the very end amen so he was
[1:06:13] driven from the presence of the Lord
[1:06:15] amen then the scripture says in the 17th
[1:06:18] verse that his first son Enoch he built
[1:06:21] a city so the first Builders of civil
[1:06:25] ization came from Allelujah and I know
[1:06:28] we're electricians and and Builders
[1:06:30] around here the first builder of a city
[1:06:35] was K seed amen I I if you were to if
[1:06:40] you were going down to the 20 uh first
[1:06:42] verse he said that that he one of his
[1:06:45] sons was the father of all such as
[1:06:48] handle the harp and the organ they're
[1:06:51] they're the one that built this amen the
[1:06:54] 22nd verse he says he had a son that was
[1:06:57] an instructor of every artificer in
[1:07:00] brass and iron you going down to the
[1:07:03] 23rd verse and then you find that one of
[1:07:07] his sons amen killed another man and he
[1:07:11] says for I have slain a man to my
[1:07:13] wounding and a young man to my hurt if K
[1:07:15] if Cain be a viid Sevenfold truly lmch
[1:07:19] uh 70 and Sevenfold So So we find that
[1:07:24] that that
[1:07:26] civilization murders adulteries and lies
[1:07:31] all came from
[1:07:34] Cain it did not come and then and then
[1:07:38] you so so you can see that Abel Abel was
[1:07:42] a was he was the son of Adam who was the
[1:07:44] son of
[1:07:45] God and he was a
[1:07:47] farmer he was
[1:07:49] simple amen he you know but he had a
[1:07:53] spiritual Insight of a virgin born
[1:07:56] savior that was to come and he knew the
[1:07:58] original sin that it was blood and not
[1:08:00] apples and he he offered the blood of a
[1:08:04] lamb symbolizing that there was going to
[1:08:06] be a virgin born son uh so many years
[1:08:09] later that was going to come and bring
[1:08:11] bring bring uh Humanity back into their
[1:08:14] place can you say Amen now now now now
[1:08:18] listen to this now let's go on down to
[1:08:19] the 25th
[1:08:21] verse and Adam knew his wife again now
[1:08:25] the first of the chapter said and Adam
[1:08:26] knew Eve and then there came two sons we
[1:08:30] understand that Eve had already partaken
[1:08:32] of the fruit amen she's already pregnant
[1:08:36] then she goes and gives to Adam and now
[1:08:39] she's pregnant again so now we've got
[1:08:41] the son of the serpent in her we've got
[1:08:43] the son of the of Adam in her then we
[1:08:47] see that the son of the serpent gets
[1:08:49] jealous of the son of Adam and and then
[1:08:53] he kills he kills the son of the of Adam
[1:08:57] and so and the Bible says amen that that
[1:09:00] the world was just chaotic now watch
[1:09:03] this watch this 25th verse and Adam knew
[1:09:06] his wife again and she bare a son and
[1:09:10] called his name Seth for she said for
[1:09:14] God she said hath appointed me another
[1:09:16] seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew and
[1:09:19] to Seth and to him also uh was born a
[1:09:23] son and he called his name Enos and then
[1:09:27] began man to call upon the name of the
[1:09:31] Lord amen once Adam's lineage came back
[1:09:36] then men began to call on the name of
[1:09:40] the Lord all right any
[1:09:42] questions did I mess up I see Smiles
[1:09:46] amen all right so so any uh uh any
[1:09:50] anything you want to is this is this too
[1:09:52] slow amen okay amen so another question
[1:09:58] and and I thought this is a good one so
[1:10:00] is it true that Giants come from the
[1:10:04] relationships between angels and
[1:10:07] women well there is a very popular that
[1:10:11] is a very popular argument that that
[1:10:16] that the Giants uh there in Revel or in
[1:10:19] Genesis the 6th chapter and the first
[1:10:22] verse there between six one 1 through 8
[1:10:26] and this is where they get this uh that
[1:10:29] that let's just read let's just read and
[1:10:32] it came to pass uh 6 and one when man
[1:10:35] began to multiply on the face of the
[1:10:36] Earth and daughters were born unto them
[1:10:39] that the sons of God saw the daughters
[1:10:44] of men that they were fair and they took
[1:10:47] them wives of all which they chose and
[1:10:51] God said my spirit shall not always
[1:10:53] strive with man for he that is he is
[1:10:56] also his flesh yet his day shall be 120
[1:10:59] years and there were giants in the earth
[1:11:02] in those days also after that when the
[1:11:06] sons of uh God came in unto the
[1:11:09] daughters of men and they bear children
[1:11:12] to them and the same became Great Men
[1:11:15] which were of old men of renown and God
[1:11:19] saw that the wickedness of man was so
[1:11:21] great in the earth and that every
[1:11:22] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:11:25] was only on evil continually it repented
[1:11:28] the Lord that he had made man on the
[1:11:30] earth and it grieved him at his heart
[1:11:32] and the Lord said I will destroy man
[1:11:34] whom I have created from the face of the
[1:11:36] Earth both man and Beast and the
[1:11:38] creeping thing and the fowls of the air
[1:11:39] for it repented me that I that I have
[1:11:42] made them but Noah found Grace in the
[1:11:45] eyes of the Lord so the question is okay
[1:11:48] so who are the sons of God and who are
[1:11:50] the daughters of
[1:11:52] men so so uh Joseph cus and and and some
[1:11:56] of these other uh uh historians and and
[1:12:00] theologians uh and and and that's what
[1:12:02] you were talking about the other night
[1:12:04] brother Joe uh was the you know uh and I
[1:12:07] don't know that word I can't speak that
[1:12:09] word again but um these they say Angels
[1:12:13] came down and had relationships with
[1:12:17] women and and that the Angels were the
[1:12:19] sons of God they had relationships with
[1:12:21] women and then they were produced Giants
[1:12:24] well amen that sounds good uh it might
[1:12:28] look good on paper but a spirit cannot
[1:12:33] have relationship with a
[1:12:36] woman that was the problem in the
[1:12:40] garden that's how Satan came in he came
[1:12:44] in he got in he got into the human race
[1:12:50] through that
[1:12:52] serpent Satan had to move inside a body
[1:12:55] he's a spirit he can't do nothing unless
[1:12:58] he has a body so he moved inside that
[1:13:01] body possessed that body and that big
[1:13:05] beast that was not human that Beast
[1:13:09] impregnated Eve Eve produced Cain Cain
[1:13:14] was driven to the Land of
[1:13:17] Nod and then the sons of God Adam seed
[1:13:23] and the daughters of men
[1:13:26] can seed began to come together and
[1:13:30] there were giants in the
[1:13:32] land that's how it happened that's
[1:13:35] that's that's that's that's scripture so
[1:13:38] amen so so many say many many have tried
[1:13:42] to first of all are y'all are y'all
[1:13:44] catching me so far am I am I leaving
[1:13:46] anybody behind amen so angels
[1:13:50] can cannot I you know we we with a mixed
[1:13:53] audience I I don't want to just say
[1:13:55] words but Angels just Angels can't have
[1:13:58] sex with women it just can't happen it
[1:14:01] takes human beings to do those kinds of
[1:14:03] things you got to a dog's got to have a
[1:14:05] dog right and so Angels can't do these
[1:14:11] things so it require so when they they
[1:14:14] say the sons of God and the daughters of
[1:14:19] men would go back to the beginning right
[1:14:24] Cain was the son of the wicked one yes
[1:14:30] now now you cannot say you cannot there
[1:14:33] in there in the Book of Matthew says
[1:14:35] that that it tied Adam directly to the
[1:14:38] lineage of God it did go back and go
[1:14:41] back and look at Adam's lineage and from
[1:14:43] Adam it was God
[1:14:47] H so now you've got the you've got
[1:14:50] you've got Cain that is that is tied
[1:14:52] directly to the evil and you've got Adam
[1:14:55] that is tied directly well then how can
[1:14:58] how can Adam be the wicked one you got
[1:15:02] me you see how that you see how that
[1:15:05] works now amen so so I want you to see
[1:15:08] that so Satan he can't create Satan
[1:15:12] can't do any of that he had to find a
[1:15:15] body and the Ephesian Church age that we
[1:15:18] read last week and I'm just going to I'm
[1:15:19] just going to read just a real a small
[1:15:20] clip of it as the seed of the woman was
[1:15:23] literally God reproducing himself in
[1:15:26] human flesh so was the seed of the
[1:15:29] serpent so the seed of the serpent is
[1:15:31] the literal way that Satan found he was
[1:15:34] able to open the door to himself into
[1:15:36] the human race it was impossible for
[1:15:38] Satan for he is only a created spirit
[1:15:41] being to reproduce himself in the manner
[1:15:43] in which God reproduced himself so
[1:15:45] Genesis account tells how he produced
[1:15:48] his seed and introduced or injected
[1:15:51] himself into the human
[1:15:52] race and recall that Satan is called
[1:15:55] serpent it is his seed or injection into
[1:15:58] the human race that we are speaking of
[1:16:01] can you say Amen so so y'all got that
[1:16:07] amen all right now I want you to if ask
[1:16:09] questions if you need to um all right uh
[1:16:13] the another one is is there a certain
[1:16:16] race that
[1:16:19] is is is there a certain
[1:16:22] race uh on earth that is the lineage of
[1:16:25] The
[1:16:26] Serpent and um in in other words what's
[1:16:29] asking is what happened to the serpent
[1:16:30] what happened to the race the Serpent's
[1:16:32] race where where are they at some people
[1:16:34] say it's the black people some people
[1:16:36] say it's the Jews some people say it's
[1:16:37] this that and the other um amen but but
[1:16:41] no there there is no race of people that
[1:16:45] are the serpent seed in this day since
[1:16:48] the time of Noah Adam's Adam's race and
[1:16:52] the Serpent's race has mixed that's what
[1:16:54] we just read when the sons and daughters
[1:16:56] come together and and uh mix together so
[1:17:00] so we we are all in bread it's it's
[1:17:03] that's just that's just the way in that
[1:17:05] natural is amen they came over they they
[1:17:08] God God destroyed the whole the the
[1:17:11] everything and there was uh uh uh Noah
[1:17:15] and his wife and his sons and his
[1:17:17] daughters-in-law eight inla they came
[1:17:20] over and and I I don't believe that
[1:17:22] Noah's boys or Noah uh I don't believe
[1:17:26] God would have chose them to to be on
[1:17:28] the ark if uh uh if if if if if they
[1:17:34] were but but they brought
[1:17:35] daughters-in-law over and so uh so the
[1:17:39] prophet says that it came over through
[1:17:40] the ark and went and went on and then we
[1:17:43] we understand you know but today today
[1:17:46] you say now now what what would we um
[1:17:53] uh what then then the then the the
[1:17:56] serpent seed is is is no longer around
[1:18:00] oh yes the serpent is still very much
[1:18:03] alive just like Jesus Christ is still
[1:18:05] very much alive and we are not we are
[1:18:09] not the uh Jews but yet we're the Seed
[1:18:14] of
[1:18:15] Abraham it's the spiritual lineage we're
[1:18:18] the seed of Jesus through Jesus He Is We
[1:18:21] Are of the Seed of Abraham the royal
[1:18:25] Seed of Abraham the life that was in
[1:18:28] Abraham is within
[1:18:30] us that's that's why we've got to have a
[1:18:33] new birth that's why we've got to have a
[1:18:36] new birth so Satan today Satan is able
[1:18:39] to fulfill his his his his plan because
[1:18:42] humanity is no longer humanity is no
[1:18:46] longer uh perfect couple in the Garden
[1:18:49] of Eden well Satan's got the whole world
[1:18:52] it's it's it it's full of sin perversion
[1:18:55] is full of all of these things are you
[1:18:57] understanding so now Satan's got vessels
[1:19:00] to work with to bring he bring about his
[1:19:04] spiritual lineage on down all the way to
[1:19:07] the to till they get cast into the Lake
[1:19:09] of Fire amen Christ has got his
[1:19:11] spiritual lineage and and and I Think
[1:19:14] Jesus let us know what there in in in um
[1:19:17] in in the New Testament there in Matthew
[1:19:19] and Luke where he where he talks about
[1:19:21] the field that was that was sold with
[1:19:23] seeds God sold his seed seed and then or
[1:19:25] the good man sowed the seed and then the
[1:19:27] and then the evil come in and solded his
[1:19:28] seed and then they were going to grow up
[1:19:30] into the world until the very end and
[1:19:32] then there's going to be the the the the
[1:19:34] the serpent or or the tears and the
[1:19:37] wheat and and goes on from there can you
[1:19:39] say Amen all right so we're getting
[1:19:41] close to being in uh uh but I but I I'm
[1:19:45] telling you I I can tell you guys are
[1:19:46] fighting the Sandman really
[1:19:48] bad amen so uh now I I want I I want you
[1:19:54] to enjoy this here I don't want y'all
[1:19:55] being getting too tired and fall asleep
[1:19:57] listen it's only 8:00 amen a little
[1:19:59] after praise the Lord and so um amen so
[1:20:04] punch your neighbor
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:08] or so um uh I I think I I I think these
[1:20:14] questions are good and um uh so okay now
[1:20:20] matters of fact
[1:20:22] um I want us to deal with um I I want us
[1:20:27] I want us to think about that as U since
[1:20:31] since the fall since the fall uh Satan
[1:20:34] has has become synonymous with the
[1:20:36] serpent so it was Lucifer the angel of
[1:20:38] Light that that moved inside him it was
[1:20:41] the star of the moment now remember
[1:20:43] Ezekiel 28:14 if you'd put that back up
[1:20:45] there again Thou Art the anointed cherub
[1:20:50] that
[1:20:55] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[1:21:01] coverthe anointed that that and and and
[1:21:04] and cover it means to hedge to fence
[1:21:06] about it means to overshadow it was to
[1:21:08] guard The Mercy Seat it was the it was
[1:21:11] to hovering over over the ark and and
[1:21:14] flanked around the Throne of God of God
[1:21:17] see so this this was what Lucifer was
[1:21:21] now Lucifer when he come in he was
[1:21:24] bringing in that same covering to Eve he
[1:21:28] was he was coming in now and he was he
[1:21:31] was skilled at it but he turned bad it
[1:21:35] used to be to stand there for the things
[1:21:36] of God and now but now he's now he's
[1:21:39] covering for his own evil ways and and
[1:21:43] and and brother brother Bram would say
[1:21:45] he he'd say and those spirits that come
[1:21:47] from the Throne of God and stands Before
[1:21:50] the Throne of God he says he they live
[1:21:53] billions and billions and ons of time
[1:21:55] before the world ever began in the
[1:21:57] presence of God you think they don't
[1:21:59] know something about worship and they
[1:22:01] come down and get into men right into
[1:22:03] men and they worship God absolutely they
[1:22:06] worship God they have knowledge of God
[1:22:08] they're smart they're shrewd they're
[1:22:10] educated always but God rejected them
[1:22:13] from the beginning and and so so we we
[1:22:16] want to understand that Cain was a
[1:22:19] beautiful
[1:22:22] worshipper Abel's Abel's wor worship was
[1:22:25] was was nasty Abel's worship was was uh
[1:22:29] uh blood all over the place the lambas
[1:22:33] uh gurgling in his blood and and and
[1:22:36] Abel or and Cain was his worship was
[1:22:40] beautiful offering that put before God
[1:22:42] and God rejected his knowledge his his
[1:22:46] Beauty for the
[1:22:48] raw revelation of
[1:22:53] Abel
[1:23:00] well well I
[1:23:03] um that that does No I um yes and no
[1:23:09] you're fighting the flesh you're in a
[1:23:10] hybrid body that is that that that is
[1:23:12] for sure that you're you're we're in we
[1:23:15] are hybrids we fight our our sicknesses
[1:23:17] and all of those things because we did
[1:23:19] not come the spoken word way the way
[1:23:21] that God originally intended but but the
[1:23:24] but the the nature our nature was closed
[1:23:27] off when she partook of that tree of
[1:23:30] knowledge before the Act was even done
[1:23:33] she had already fallen in in her spirit
[1:23:38] before God when she accepted the LIE of
[1:23:40] the devil that's right and so so that
[1:23:44] and and then when Adam of course partook
[1:23:46] of that then it it became the same thing
[1:23:48] so yes it it was it was that act it was
[1:23:53] per partaken of that tree of knowledge
[1:23:55] that that that has brought us all into
[1:23:58] this physical state that we are in but
[1:24:00] here's the deal brother Joe yet you are
[1:24:03] a predestinated son of God written in
[1:24:06] his book Adam was supposed to look at
[1:24:08] that book and call names off Adam was
[1:24:11] supposed to be be speaking and and word
[1:24:14] born Sons come just like Adam was that's
[1:24:17] the way we're all supposed to be here
[1:24:19] we're not supposed to be here with
[1:24:20] complexes we're not supposed to be here
[1:24:22] diseased and and and and and our ups and
[1:24:26] downs and up that's that's that's not
[1:24:28] that's not the way it's supposed to be
[1:24:30] you see what I'm saying but Christ has
[1:24:32] redeemed us back it took a virgin born
[1:24:37] son of God to come and give his blood to
[1:24:42] to uh uh pay for the blood sin at the
[1:24:48] beginning so so uh yes it it it it's
[1:24:53] it's that blood sin that that Christ
[1:24:55] came to do amen so now you say in the
[1:24:59] spirit realm now we can understand that
[1:25:01] God's God the spirit of Christ is here
[1:25:04] living his life through us now because
[1:25:06] what did he do he come to set us free
[1:25:08] from this bondage set that Soul free to
[1:25:11] now we can communicate back with Spirit
[1:25:14] God once again yall y'all catching that
[1:25:16] sons of God are now in the presence of
[1:25:19] God though living in this
[1:25:22] body well devils are there there Satan's
[1:25:25] got his own Clan too I mean amen uh uh
[1:25:29] you know you you look there there in 2
[1:25:31] Corinthians 11: 14 no Marvel for Satan
[1:25:34] himself is
[1:25:36] transformed into an angel of
[1:25:39] Light
[1:25:41] see he's he he's he's ministered I I I I
[1:25:45] didn't I didn't write it down
[1:25:47] um man uh I didn't write it down the the
[1:25:50] other scriptures where but where where
[1:25:53] Jesus or where the Apostle Paul he says
[1:25:55] and now his he said it's no wonder that
[1:25:58] his ministers have turned into uh angels
[1:26:01] of light Apostles of Deceit they become
[1:26:05] Ministers of deception just like the
[1:26:09] serpent did at the
[1:26:10] beginning they they be they become
[1:26:12] messengers of deception and so uh but
[1:26:16] the a but it it'll be the seed of God it
[1:26:19] was the seed of God that resisted him at
[1:26:21] the beginning and it's the seed of God
[1:26:22] that'll resist him at the ending
[1:26:25] amen amen praise the Lord so any
[1:26:29] questions here
[1:26:33] tonight amen anything anyone wants to
[1:26:36] brother
[1:26:38] Harry would it
[1:26:48] be because we know brother brandom told
[1:26:50] us that sin is unbelief yes and so be
[1:26:54] accurate to say
[1:26:55] that each sin started out in the spirit
[1:26:59] by disbelieving God's word and then it
[1:27:02] went into the physical with the act that
[1:27:06] is that that's a good explanation and
[1:27:09] that's exactly the way the brother
[1:27:10] brandham done it preached it in um
[1:27:15] um
[1:27:16] uh the greatest battle ever fought he he
[1:27:20] he he deals with that at length before
[1:27:23] the ACT ual the adultery had already
[1:27:26] taken place before the actual Act was
[1:27:29] ever committed because she had stopped
[1:27:31] partake of knowledge and the soon as she
[1:27:34] took she soon as she bit into it it was
[1:27:38] death deception could she she was
[1:27:42] totally deceived by the time the Act was
[1:27:44] committed so that's that's that's that's
[1:27:47] pretty powerful that's pretty powerful
[1:27:49] you don't stop and leave God's word to
[1:27:52] partake of of the of the knowledge that
[1:27:56] Satan wants to bring to us you can't do
[1:27:59] that and you know I'm that's just just
[1:28:03] where you know I tell all of you young
[1:28:04] men you can't do that don't even stop to
[1:28:08] entertain any thought that that that is
[1:28:11] that is that that that is trying to say
[1:28:13] something contrary don't even don't even
[1:28:16] think about it just run away from it and
[1:28:18] believe what God says I don't care you
[1:28:20] don't have to know the other side of the
[1:28:22] story you don't have to know what
[1:28:24] everyone else thinks you don't have to
[1:28:26] get on websites and on the believe the
[1:28:28] sign and don't just stay away from it
[1:28:30] don't get don't bite into that fruit
[1:28:35] whatsoever stay away from
[1:28:37] it well what if I'm deceived well you're
[1:28:40] you're you're you you're pretty deceived
[1:28:43] right now if you're sitting there
[1:28:45] looking at the Bible and and and seeing
[1:28:48] the Vindication of what God Said on this
[1:28:49] day and you're saying what if I can be
[1:28:52] deceived maybe I should check
[1:28:55] you're right there at the same tree Eve
[1:28:56] was at that's right that's right don't
[1:29:00] you look at that if you see the word of
[1:29:02] God Vindicated and you see the promise
[1:29:04] of this day that that's that's been
[1:29:06] Vindicated by God stay away from
[1:29:09] knowledge stay away from that stuff stay
[1:29:12] with God's word can you say
[1:29:14] Amen but uh uh uh write these down I'm
[1:29:17] I'm we're going to we're going to close
[1:29:19] but write these write write these
[1:29:20] scriptures down Matthew 23 and 33 watch
[1:29:24] watch what Jesus said you serpents you
[1:29:28] Generation of Vipers that word
[1:29:30] generation means offspring of vipers how
[1:29:33] can you escape the damnation of Hell
[1:29:37] Matthew 12 and 34 oh generation or
[1:29:41] offspring of vipers how can ye being
[1:29:44] evil speak good things for out of the
[1:29:46] abundance of the heart the moue
[1:29:49] speaketh Jesus was was declaring that
[1:29:53] there is that's spiritual
[1:29:56] lineage these guys could take their
[1:29:59] lineage all the way back to Abraham
[1:30:01] that's right right and they were saying
[1:30:03] we're of Abraham and you don't know what
[1:30:06] you're talking about and Jesus was
[1:30:07] saying you're The Offspring of the
[1:30:13] serpent now let let's look here at John
[1:30:18] 8:39 they answered and said unto him
[1:30:20] Abraham is our father Jesus said unto
[1:30:23] him if you were Abraham's children you
[1:30:25] would do the works of Abraham but now
[1:30:27] you seek to kill me a man that has told
[1:30:30] you the truth which I heard of God this
[1:30:34] did not
[1:30:35] Abraham you do the Deeds of your
[1:30:39] father then they said said they to him
[1:30:43] we be not born of fornication we have
[1:30:46] one father even
[1:30:48] God Jesus now now watch now watch they
[1:30:53] know they
[1:30:54] they they knew the serpent Seed doctrine
[1:30:57] yes they the Jews believed it but see
[1:31:00] they thought that they it was a it was a
[1:31:03] natural lineage so they were saying
[1:31:05] we've got the pure bloodline we we're
[1:31:07] not we're we're not of that Cain
[1:31:09] bloodline we're of Abraham's bloodline
[1:31:12] and we can go all the way back to back
[1:31:14] and back and back and we can take
[1:31:15] generation after generation we know who
[1:31:17] we are and the Jews were people of
[1:31:20] lineage they kept their family tree
[1:31:24] that's
[1:31:26] right and Jesus looks at
[1:31:29] him and said you're of the lineage of
[1:31:33] the
[1:31:35] serpent the father of Cain and they're
[1:31:39] coming back saying we're not we can
[1:31:43] prove to
[1:31:44] you so he says you're of your Deeds you
[1:31:47] do the Deeds of the your father they say
[1:31:49] unto him we be not born of fornication
[1:31:52] in other words our lineage didn't come
[1:31:54] from Cain we have one father even God
[1:31:58] Jesus said unto them if God were your
[1:32:00] father you would love me for I proceeded
[1:32:02] forth and came from
[1:32:05] God neither came I of myself but he sent
[1:32:08] me why do you not understand my speech
[1:32:11] even because you cannot hear my word you
[1:32:17] are of your father the devil and the
[1:32:20] lust of your father you will do he was a
[1:32:24] murderer
[1:32:25] from yeah oh boy he's connecting him
[1:32:30] right to Cain right now he was a
[1:32:33] murderer from the beginning and Abode
[1:32:37] not in truth because there's no truth in
[1:32:39] him and when he speaketh a lie he
[1:32:42] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[1:32:44] the father of it and because I tell you
[1:32:47] the truth you believe me
[1:32:50] not amen well
[1:32:54] there is a
[1:32:56] lineage the lineage of God is going to
[1:32:58] believe God's
[1:33:00] word there are humble they're are humble
[1:33:03] people well can you say man we're all
[1:33:06] growing up but remember don't you take
[1:33:08] don't you defend this nature here don't
[1:33:11] defend this this nature here is not
[1:33:13] worth defending this this this thing
[1:33:16] here has got to fall off but that
[1:33:18] Eternal seat on the inside of you is of
[1:33:20] god well glory to God Amen amen so so
[1:33:26] even even the Apostle Paul even even he
[1:33:28] would say Amen as he's looking there at
[1:33:31] the Corinthian Church and he's telling
[1:33:33] the Corinthian Church I believe there
[1:33:35] where's that at there uh uh I fear Les
[1:33:38] Satan would beguile
[1:33:40] you um um praise the lord it's in 2
[1:33:46] Corinthians amen you know where that's
[1:33:48] at brother Merl Oh Sister Cay knows
[1:33:51] where that's at amen but I fear less by
[1:33:53] any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:33:56] through his
[1:33:57] subtlety so your minds should be
[1:34:00] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[1:34:05] Christ
[1:34:07] um let let's let's let's go up where's
[1:34:10] where's the Virgin i' I've I've uh given
[1:34:13] you as a virgin okay I'm watch this what
[1:34:16] watch watch this how he's putting The
[1:34:17] Serpent and the virginity of this bride
[1:34:20] together I'm jealous over you with The
[1:34:23] Godly jealousy for I have espoused you
[1:34:25] to one husband that I may present you as
[1:34:28] a chased virgin to Christ but I fear
[1:34:34] lest by any means as the serpent
[1:34:37] beguiled Eve through his subtilty and
[1:34:40] she lost her virginity so your minds
[1:34:44] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[1:34:46] that is in Christ the fourth verse now
[1:34:49] for he that cometh and preacheth another
[1:34:51] Jesus whom we have not preed preached or
[1:34:54] if you received another Spirit whom you
[1:34:56] have not received or another gospel
[1:34:58] which you have not accepted ye might
[1:35:00] bear with well bear with him for I
[1:35:03] suppose I was not a wit behind the very
[1:35:06] chiefest of the Apostles

[1:38:16] first chapter of the Book of
[1:38:19] Genesis Genesis 1 and 26 God
[1:38:24] created man in the image of God it was a
[1:38:28] spirit
[1:38:30] image God told that Spirit man I'm
[1:38:34] giving you do I I I giving you dominion
[1:38:38] over the foul of the air fish of the Sea
[1:38:41] Beast of the field I want you to
[1:38:44] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[1:38:47] take dominion over
[1:38:50] it but man didn't have a body there was
[1:38:54] no body Adam was given this Authority
[1:38:57] and no body the Bible
[1:39:00] says and there was no
[1:39:02] man to plow the
[1:39:05] field we have that problem sometimes in
[1:39:07] the church amen everyone's all in spirit
[1:39:10] wanting to do something
[1:39:12] anyways so but God's got to have
[1:39:17] bodies so here we
[1:39:20] stand now we're looking at Genesis 2 and
[1:39:23] 7
[1:39:24] heav and the Bible says and the Lord
[1:39:28] God created man from the death of the
[1:39:32] field there is not one place
[1:39:36] given where he told that man replenish
[1:39:40] and
[1:39:42] multiply that was given to the spirit
[1:39:46] man in Genesis
[1:39:48] 1:26 Genesis 2 and7 was simply what the
[1:39:53] were supposed to do what man was going
[1:39:55] to use to take care of the
[1:40:00] garden Satan came in and says
[1:40:05] hey never
[1:40:07] mind the
[1:40:09] spirit let me let me show you a few
[1:40:11] things
[1:40:13] here and he found a way in to the body
[1:40:18] of the human race and that's how
[1:40:20] sickness and death and pride
[1:40:23] and all of this stuff all came in and
[1:40:26] we're the subject we're subject to
[1:40:29] that Jesus came and
[1:40:32] says all
[1:40:34] right you got your body yeah that that
[1:40:37] you know you're you're you're getting
[1:40:38] smarter you you got your body you you
[1:40:41] know you you've done good for yourself
[1:40:43] you've built big cities you're doing it
[1:40:46] all I've got to get you back to Genesis
[1:40:52] 1:26
[1:40:53] Jesus came the Virgin born son of
[1:40:58] God hung on Calvary to pay for your sex
[1:41:02] sins and the sin of
[1:41:06] unbelief to take you back so that you
[1:41:10] can
[1:41:11] fulfill Genesis
[1:41:17] 1:26 see man's been trying to subdue the
[1:41:19] Earth with Genesis 2 and
[1:41:22] 7 but God's called you to dominate the
[1:41:25] Earth with Genesis
[1:41:29] 1:26 just trying to bring it down pretty
