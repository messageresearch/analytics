[41:48] Lord that you would speak to us as we
[41:49] said it's your feet it's our honor to
[41:52] sit here this morning we're asking Lord
[41:55] that you would Minister
[41:57] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[42:00] the church say amen amen and amen God
[42:03] bless you you may be seated here this
[42:05] morning
[42:07] amen praise the Lord I want
[42:11] to minister uh I've I've been doing this
[42:14] on Wednesday nights but I I thought that
[42:17] um I would go ahead and and Minister a
[42:20] little more on on
[42:23] ministry here uh this morning and um
[42:27] we've been talking about the preacher
[42:29] and then the last I had preached on the
[42:33] ministry of love and we are all
[42:38] ministers we are we are all here with
[42:42] this um with an incredible
[42:46] responsibility amen and the Apostle Paul
[42:49] says the necessity is laid upon me and
[42:51] woe is me if I fulfill not my purpose
[42:56] and I so I want to minister on the
[43:00] weight of ministry or the burden of
[43:04] ministry amen being burdened for Souls
[43:09] that you and I have been you and I have
[43:12] been committed unto uh we have been
[43:16] placed here on this Earth with a
[43:19] specific purpose a very specific purpose
[43:22] we everyone have come
[43:26] and we are here today with an incredible
[43:31] responsibility amen now
[43:34] the the ministry is not just a Pulpit
[43:39] ministry as we have mentioned from time
[43:42] to time amen yes there are ministers
[43:45] that stand behind the pulpit and we are
[43:48] thankful for everyone of those ministers
[43:52] we appreciate all of the preachers here
[43:55] but if you'll notice notice the preacher
[43:59] is one that expresses that Ministry
[44:02] outside of the pulpit he loves people
[44:05] amen his ministry is people and so he's
[44:10] not just suddenly anointed and happy
[44:12] when he's behind the pulpit but there is
[44:15] something on the inside within him that
[44:18] is driving him brother brandham would
[44:20] Express that it is it it it is just like
[44:23] that artisian well that is just bubling
[44:26] up he loves people so he's not just
[44:29] smiling and dancing and shouting behind
[44:31] the pull pit he is smiling and happy and
[44:34] loves people outside the pulpit that's
[44:38] that's that Ministry that is being
[44:41] expressed now amen but but the pulpit
[44:45] Ministry is not is not everything not
[44:48] all of us are called to be preachers not
[44:51] all are called to be prophets not all
[44:54] are called to be evang evangelist or or
[44:58] Apostles but we all are a part of the
[45:03] body of Christ and we are here under the
[45:07] authority and are taking
[45:10] Dominion together over devils and
[45:13] together as as a body of Jesus Christ we
[45:19] set the captives free we cast out Devils
[45:24] now brother Brenham was asked does that
[45:26] necessarily mean when it says these
[45:28] signs shall follow them that believe is
[45:31] everyone casting out Devils does
[45:33] everyone have the gift of healing
[45:35] brother bradam says no not everyone has
[45:39] the gift of healing not everyone has
[45:42] amen but together as the body of Christ
[45:47] we have one Ministry everyone say one
[45:52] Ministry you see I it's I'm just a small
[45:55] part part of that one Ministry amen I
[46:00] you you I have many amen parts of my
[46:03] body but I am one person amen I have one
[46:08] personality and that's that spirit that
[46:10] lives within me can you say Amen so
[46:14] every one of us carry amen a a weight of
[46:18] responsibility there is not one member
[46:21] that that is that is exempt from
[46:24] responsibility
[46:26] toward one another and toward amen uh
[46:30] the call that God has placed upon Our
[46:32] Lives amen so when we say that amen the
[46:36] weight of ministry or the burden of
[46:39] ministry amen it is saying that you are
[46:42] you feel the weight amen of
[46:47] responsibility you feel a burden for uh
[46:50] for your brother and your your sister no
[46:53] man lives to themselves no man dies to
[46:56] themselves I am responsible for you and
[46:58] you are responsible for me right praise
[47:01] the Lord amen and so when when we say
[47:05] burden for Souls we are carrying burdens
[47:09] for them amen and and when you're
[47:11] carrying a burden a burden is to give
[47:13] someone their problems or trouble or
[47:17] responsibility Amen to carry someone's
[47:21] weight it is to take away or carry off
[47:24] the weight uh uh someone else is
[47:28] experiencing amen so when God places a
[47:31] burden upon your heart it literally
[47:35] weighs upon your heart amen and the more
[47:39] fully that you can
[47:41] identify amen with the need of your
[47:43] brother or sister the more deeply you
[47:47] will feel the responsibility for them
[47:50] amen so you let let me let me just say
[47:53] it again the more fully the that you can
[47:57] identify with the situation or with the
[48:01] need of the body then the more deeply
[48:06] that you will feel the need for it amen
[48:10] so the we we don't separate ourselves
[48:13] because we don't live to ourselves but
[48:16] we are a unit in the spirit of the Lord
[48:20] amen then you can stand as as the
[48:22] Apostle Paul so totally in developed in
[48:26] the purpose of God that he said we pray
[48:29] you in Christ be ye reconciled unto God
[48:33] for God has given me the ministry of
[48:36] reconciliation he he placed himself he
[48:40] found himself in the position that God
[48:44] had placed for him this why brother
[48:45] brandham says amen all of the jumping
[48:47] and the shouting and the and and and the
[48:49] hollering and this speaking in tongues
[48:50] and this that and the other he says man
[48:52] you got a lot of power amen and it's
[48:54] going out the whistle but if you could
[48:56] ever find your purpose if you could ever
[48:59] understand that you are to be
[49:00] positionally placed then you can get the
[49:02] machine to go and down the road amen
[49:05] then you can get the machine to to
[49:07] operating the way God ordained it to
[49:10] operate well praise the Lord amen so
[49:13] that's what this message is all about
[49:15] it's the adoption message it is the
[49:18] placing of human beings on the earth
[49:22] fulfilling the purpose of God right one
[49:25] with deity where the power the presence
[49:28] the glory the shakina presence of God
[49:31] has came out of the heavens and is
[49:33] living bodily within human beings here
[49:36] on this
[49:37] Earth Oh Glory to God Amen you become
[49:43] the physical body of Jesus Christ so
[49:46] that his agape love is flowing in and
[49:50] out of you there in St John 17 and 18 it
[49:54] says as as as thou H has sent me into
[49:58] the world even so have I also sent them
[50:03] into the world and for their sakes I
[50:08] sanctify myself that they might be
[50:13] Sanctified through the truth can you say
[50:16] amen amen so you can understand now I've
[50:19] been called in position to to bring
[50:22] about a a a directive of God I've I've
[50:25] been I've been called to redeem them
[50:28] amen so that they in turn can fulfill
[50:32] the purpose for which they were called
[50:34] for you were called to minister before
[50:37] sin ever came you were called with a
[50:39] purpose before amen be before the fall
[50:42] ever got here Satan came in and and and
[50:46] and and and put a uh you know brought
[50:48] you out of that realm but Christ has
[50:52] come to restore you back to that place
[50:56] of authority with God Amen now amen here
[51:00] we are as Fallen humans but redeemed
[51:03] Fallen humans amen there in Galatians
[51:06] 6:1 now it says Brethren If any man be
[51:10] overtaken in a fault ye which are
[51:12] spiritual restore such a one in the
[51:15] spirit of meekness considering thyself
[51:18] lest thou also be tempted bear ye one
[51:21] another's burdens and so fulfill the law
[51:26] of Christ the the law that Christ lived
[51:29] by is what we are now living by he
[51:33] picked those up when you couldn't carry
[51:35] your own burden and he carried it to the
[51:38] cross for you amen when you couldn't he
[51:41] did when you had the lack he came in and
[51:45] brought in and I say tonight here you
[51:48] stand this morning you said in this
[51:50] church amen Anointed with the very

[52:13] that you would have fulfilled if there
[52:16] had not been no sin on the Earth but now
[52:19] Christ has come to remove Sin from you
[52:22] so that you can fulfill the purpose that
[52:26] God originally had for you

[54:35] righteous man will one die per adventure

[56:06] describe a burden as entering into the
[56:09] suffering of a person to have the
[56:12] feelings for someone to understand their
[56:15] pain he says but here's one thing I want
[56:17] to be honest I want to live in the
[56:20] condition just like the people that come
[56:22] to me so I can feel the suffering and
[56:26] fellowship with them and I'm right on
[56:29] the level with them that's the way I
[56:32] feel I don't say that just from a mouth
[56:35] I say that from a heart and God knows it
[56:38] to be the
[56:39] truth amen are are you understanding now

[56:54] successful it's been because of love I
[56:58] genuinely love people amen now he would

[57:05] have to enter into the suffering of a
[57:07] person to have feelings for them amen I
[57:10] want you to really think you have to
[57:12] enter into the suffering of a person in
[57:16] order to have feelings for them if it
[57:19] ever gets to a place that I can't feel
[57:21] sorry for the sick then it's time for me
[57:23] to leave the platform praying for them
[57:26] when I get to the place that I can't
[57:28] feel the burden of sin on the people
[57:33] then it's time for me to get away from
[57:34] here because I can never do no good for
[57:38] God it's the feeling you have for the
[57:44] people oh burden feeling the weight the
[57:50] burden of ministry can you say Amen see

[58:35] cry for for for a brother or a sister or
[58:39] or someone that is sick and and you're
[58:42] entering in to the exact feelings there
[58:45] where they are and you're able to see
[58:48] things in a little bit different light
[58:52] than what a spectator would you were

[1:03:05] you believe that God's going to do it
[1:03:07] you watch that patient he'll begin to
[1:03:09] get better why the Evil's gone from it
[1:03:11] it's just like the tree that was
[1:03:13] standing and Jesus looked and there was
[1:03:14] no fruit on it and he said cursed be it
[1:03:17] 24 hours later they passed by and Peter

[1:03:24] spoke and Jesus says have faith in God
[1:03:28] for if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:03:31] and don't doubt it will obey you now he
[1:03:35] says it's the privilege of
[1:03:41] responsibility God's wanting to place
[1:03:44] his power on that
[1:03:50] body well praise the Lord he says now

[1:04:01] you do any of these other outward
[1:04:03] manifestations he says but if it's here

[1:06:49] very Oracles of God in human
[1:06:53] flesh
[1:06:54] amen now in the layot to seean church
[1:06:57] age brother Bram says no burden for SS
[1:06:59] but they got to see that all these other
[1:07:01] things are taken care of the L's Aid and
[1:07:05] these other things all has to be taken
[1:07:06] care of but no burden for low Souls oh
[1:07:10] man what this church has got into he
[1:07:13] says they they're not burdened for Souls
[1:07:15] but they're burdened with they're
[1:07:17] burdened with wealth that's right they
[1:07:20] had the wrong burden they had a burden
[1:07:21] for the wealth but not a burden for lost
[1:07:24] to then the scriptures say said that
[1:07:27] they didn't know that they were wretched
[1:07:29] miserable and blind they think they
[1:07:32] could take money and convert the world
[1:07:36] oh if we could just get a program on
[1:07:38] that we could get a lot of money uh here
[1:07:42] I believe it would convert the world if
[1:07:44] some of the rich people in our church
[1:07:46] brother brandham if we could just get
[1:07:48] them to dig out I believe we could start
[1:07:51] a society that will go around and
[1:07:53] convert the world we could take
[1:07:54] airplanes and drop liter literature over
[1:07:57] Africa and things like that if we just
[1:07:59] had some money brother the world won't
[1:08:02] be converted by money the world will be
[1:08:05] converted by the Holy Ghost the powerful
[1:08:09] preaching of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:08:12] cross will be the only thing that will
[1:08:15] convert the world the pro God's program
[1:08:18] is not money it's the Holy Ghost can you
[1:08:22] say Amen man he says now now if I'd say
[1:08:26] how many has the Holy Ghost all of you'd
[1:08:28] raise up your hand I'd say all right
[1:08:31] I'll see I'll see if you have it the
[1:08:34] Bible said that they that had the Holy
[1:08:36] Ghost sighed and cried day and night for
[1:08:38] the Abominations done in the city now
[1:08:40] how many hands would go up how many of
[1:08:43] you can't rest at night so full of joy
[1:08:45] the power of God and so sad for the
[1:08:47] people that's lost the power or that day
[1:08:50] and night You Weep and cry for the
[1:08:52] Abominations who who who would who would
[1:08:54] be in that City H how many's in in in
[1:08:57] the church amen that's what the Bible
[1:08:59] said the Holy Ghost evidence is can you
[1:09:02] say Amen so so brother brand I'm saying
[1:09:04] it is a Holy Ghost Church living under
[1:09:09] the living under the the the weight of
[1:09:14] ministry that is going to fulfill the
[1:09:17] Great
[1:09:19] Commission hallelujah amen it's just you
[1:09:23] living your everyday life you in love
[1:09:25] with God you calling out no it's not
[1:09:28] necessarily that you're out witnessing
[1:09:30] you can witness all the time without a
[1:09:32] burden for Souls but when God's holy
[1:09:36] spirit is within us that is crying
[1:09:40] out there's an anointing to go with that
[1:09:44] can you say amen amen yes sir now what
[1:09:48] did Brother Brandon or what did the
[1:09:49] scripture say would be one of the end
[1:09:52] time signs amen it would be a lack of
[1:09:55] love for your fellow man amen at the end
[1:09:59] time the la love of many shall wax cold
[1:10:02] but the prophet says hallelujah but the
[1:10:05] bride is will be will be under that
[1:10:08] anointing I want to say she's going to
[1:10:10] be
[1:10:11] dripping she's going to be dripping
[1:10:13] under that that Holy oil anointing of
[1:10:17] God Amen the bride will have that love
[1:10:20] can you say amen Amen brother Bram and
[1:10:23] or are you you there in in in uh God is
[1:10:27] talking to the tharan church age there
[1:10:29] in Revelations 2:19 it says I Know Thy
[1:10:32] works and love and service and faith and
[1:10:36] patience and thy works and the last to
[1:10:38] be more than the first and brother Bram
[1:10:40] would say huh he says you will note that
[1:10:43] their love is placed between works and
[1:10:46] service that is the right place for it
[1:10:49] because without love our works are not
[1:10:52] accepted before God
[1:10:54] and neither is our service see Paul
[1:10:57] speaking to the Corinthians said without
[1:10:59] love I am nothing whatever I do is
[1:11:02] without profit unless it is done in love
[1:11:05] now you can see right here that these
[1:11:07] Believers weren't in that Leo or that
[1:11:09] nickan class that did works as a mean of
[1:11:12] Salvation or to be admired by men they
[1:11:15] did their works out of love of God that
[1:11:18] was shed abroad in their hearts by the
[1:11:20] Holy Ghost and that love in their heart
[1:11:23] was God's love for his own and Jesus
[1:11:26] said by this shall all men know that
[1:11:28] you're my disciples that you have loved
[1:11:31] uh one for the other now the the pagans
[1:11:34] who saw the lives of the early
[1:11:35] Christians said behold how they love
[1:11:38] each other John uh 1 John 4 and7
[1:11:41] everyone that loveth God is born of God
[1:11:43] he says I want to give a warning right
[1:11:46] here it says concerning the last days
[1:11:49] that because the abounding of the love
[1:11:51] of many or or the abound the abounding
[1:11:54] iniquity the love of many will wax cold
[1:11:57] in the lay out of sin uh the last age
[1:12:00] the self- love love for material things
[1:12:04] will take the place of the true love of
[1:12:06] God and we need to guard against the
[1:12:08] power of sin in these last days so many
[1:12:10] are getting so hard because they haven't
[1:12:12] realized the effects of the last day
[1:12:15] spirit it's time to draw nigh to God let
[1:12:19] him fill our lives with his love or we
[1:12:21] will feel the coldness of this last day
[1:12:24] church and reject the truth which is
[1:12:26] alone able to help us can you say mine
[1:12:29] now how many's how many's how many's
[1:12:31] with me here this morning oh the
[1:12:35] responsibility the
[1:12:37] weight there's nothing more
[1:12:39] precious now you can pray a you can pray
[1:12:44] a prayer half-heartedly as you're as
[1:12:46] you're giving thanks for the meal many
[1:12:48] times we give half-hearted prayers when
[1:12:50] we're going but how many's ever
[1:12:53] experienced experienced something really
[1:12:55] deep and tragic in your own
[1:12:58] life you're not just saying lay me down
[1:13:00] to sleep prayer you're not just when
[1:13:03] it's when it's your own when it's when
[1:13:06] it's your son or your daughter or your
[1:13:08] husband your wife or whatever it it
[1:13:10] brings about a greater sense of
[1:13:15] reality sometimes we pray and we say
[1:13:18] Lord amen bless this food thank you for
[1:13:20] this food and it should be done from the
[1:13:22] depths of our heart but many times it's
[1:13:24] repetitious but it's the it's when we
[1:13:26] can feel that need that puts us now I
[1:13:30] want to I want to say
[1:13:32] this as a minister as a pastor I hope
[1:13:36] this is okay here this morning as a
[1:13:38] pastor the weight of my
[1:13:42] responsibility causes me to study and
[1:13:45] pray because I know my
[1:13:47] responsibility is to is to feed the
[1:13:52] people so so the the weight or the
[1:13:56] burden of my
[1:13:58] Ministry causes me to take it
[1:14:02] seriously amen whereas you that don't
[1:14:06] have that weight on your
[1:14:09] shoulder you're not locking yourself up
[1:14:11] on Saturdays or Fridays you're not
[1:14:14] you're not you're not spending why
[1:14:16] because that weight is not on your
[1:14:20] shoulders it's on my shoulders there for
[1:14:24] amen well you you you you're enjoying
[1:14:26] your Saturdays and you're enjoying right
[1:14:29] but mine I know that I've got to preach
[1:14:32] this morning and I've got to take my
[1:14:35] responsibility
[1:14:38] seriously you know why
[1:14:41] sin has come into the church and crept
[1:14:44] in in such a way is because the weight
[1:14:47] of
[1:14:48] responsibility is no longer there
[1:14:51] therefore we allow anything to go in our
[1:14:53] Minds we allow anything we we hard we're
[1:14:56] not we're not entertaining the presence
[1:14:59] of the Lord Bea the weight now we've got
[1:15:03] a Ministry every one of us have got a
[1:15:05] Ministry but we're not feeling that
[1:15:09] weight seriousness of it the way that it
[1:15:12] should now I'm not you know you know
[1:15:15] it's easy again again now that I'm
[1:15:17] preached about you know I've done I've
[1:15:18] done talk to us all of us preachers amen
[1:15:20] and yes this does count for us preachers
[1:15:22] but I'm talking about every one of us
[1:15:24] there would not be sin in our lives many
[1:15:29] times if we were under the
[1:15:35] load if you had preach or if you had if
[1:15:38] if you had husbands amen out caring for
[1:15:42] their families and working every day and
[1:15:44] doing those kinds of things instead of
[1:15:45] being on the internet and making their
[1:15:47] wives do the work and all that kind of
[1:15:49] thing
[1:15:50] then we we'd have a little bit different
[1:15:52] americ
[1:15:54] today but the weight of their
[1:15:56] responsibility is not there therefore
[1:15:58] their family stagnant their family is
[1:16:01] going to hell in a hand basket their
[1:16:03] children are being lost it's because
[1:16:05] daddy is not feeling the weight of his
[1:16:12] responsibility
[1:16:13] amen now are are are y'all catching me
[1:16:17] so now as I as I as as I get into my
[1:16:22] thoughts here now
[1:16:23] the scripture says that we are
[1:16:27] priests unto our
[1:16:29] God now I want to speak for a few
[1:16:32] moments Amen on the
[1:16:36] intercessors I I think
[1:16:40] intercessor having the
[1:16:42] weight of intercessory having the weight
[1:16:45] of your
[1:16:46] brother might put a little bit more
[1:16:49] spark in our
[1:16:51] prayer right
[1:16:54] because you're not just there praying
[1:16:55] for for everyone on the earth and
[1:16:57] praying for Israel and the bride and
[1:16:58] praying for this one and praying for
[1:16:59] that one Hallelujah now let's go home no
[1:17:02] now as an intercessor you know that
[1:17:04] you're
[1:17:08] responsible and you're going in before
[1:17:10] the Lord with
[1:17:13] great
[1:17:15] responsibility are you hearing
[1:17:17] me
[1:17:19] now I and
[1:17:21] I as we as we look
[1:17:25] here brother brandham even talks he
[1:17:28] talks about going with a mortal and he
[1:17:30] and he's and he's talking about even if
[1:17:32] someone's done you wrong he says now if
[1:17:34] I have found Grace in your sight through
[1:17:37] God you take my word for this
[1:17:39] Brethren if you want to be a blessing
[1:17:42] and receive a blessing get a blessing
[1:17:45] when a man has done you wrong and he has
[1:17:48] absolutely justly I mean he has done you
[1:17:50] wrong you know that he's done you wrong
[1:17:53] he has done you evil he says don't
[1:17:56] mention that take him to prayer before
[1:18:00] God now don't take it in a way of a just
[1:18:03] a selfish way well I'm supposed to do
[1:18:05] this stand with stand with your shoulder
[1:18:08] to his shoulder stand in the presence of
[1:18:11] God our Father way of prayer should be
[1:18:14] made in the presence of God and say
[1:18:16] father here's my brother he deserves
[1:18:19] punishment because he has done me evil
[1:18:22] and I don't see why he done it then let
[1:18:25] God go to talking to you and you'll see
[1:18:29] maybe what that man is gone through the
[1:18:32] man has been twisted up somewhere caused
[1:18:35] him to do that though he's absolutely
[1:18:38] wrong and before you leave the throne
[1:18:41] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[1:18:44] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[1:18:47] and when you get back down to Earth
[1:18:48] again you'll go over to that brother
[1:18:49] shake his hand cuz you know that he has
[1:18:52] what he has been
[1:18:53] through you can't not you cannot stand
[1:18:56] with a mortal in the presence of God and
[1:18:58] condemn anybody I don't believe no sir
[1:19:01] even if he is a ranked Sinner and what
[1:19:03] about a brother that has made a mistake
[1:19:05] though I say he's wrong sometimes he's
[1:19:07] accused wrong when he's not wrong but if
[1:19:09] he is wrong and if we will take him to
[1:19:12] the throne of God and stand there
[1:19:14] shoulder-to-shoulder with our brother
[1:19:16] knowing he's Immortal and maybe his
[1:19:19] destination rest upon our attitude
[1:19:21] towards him when we come back from the
[1:19:25] Throne of God we will realize that we're
[1:19:27] everyone guilty we all need help one
[1:19:31] from another and the best way to do is
[1:19:36] to
[1:19:37] pray oh wow that is talking this is
[1:19:41] totally this is totally contrary to me
[1:19:44] and
[1:19:45] you come on hey we ain't we ain't going
[1:19:48] to put up with too much too very long
[1:19:51] right but when the Holy
[1:19:53] spirit is flowing through us and working
[1:19:57] his life through us oh what a Ministry
[1:20:00] it is amen priest the prophecy was amen
[1:20:05] that God was going to bring Gentiles the
[1:20:08] Gentiles were going to rise up and they
[1:20:10] were going to be preached there in
[1:20:12] Malachi 1:11 and from the rising for
[1:20:15] from the rising of the sun even unto the
[1:20:17] going down of the same my name shall be
[1:20:20] great among the Gentiles and in every
[1:20:22] Place incense shall be offered unto my
[1:20:25] name and a pure offering for my name
[1:20:28] shall be great among the Heathen saith
[1:20:31] the Lord of hosts can you say amen amen
[1:20:34] now now what what is he talking about on
[1:20:37] that incense now remember Amen in the
[1:20:40] Tabernacle there was the Brazen altar
[1:20:43] there's where the sacrifice was burnt
[1:20:46] slay and and burnt then going into the
[1:20:49] most or into the uh holy place is is is
[1:20:53] the Brazen uh labor that's
[1:20:56] sanctification that's where you you look
[1:20:58] in the mirror of God's word and then as
[1:21:01] you come on in fixing to go into the
[1:21:03] most holy place there was the golden
[1:21:06] Altar and this is where they offered the
[1:21:09] incense they would take the blood of the
[1:21:12] original lamb amen and they would bring
[1:21:15] it up and and and they would offer the
[1:21:18] flesh there upon it and it would be a
[1:21:21] sweet smell in Savor and this is where
[1:21:25] they would pray for amen uh H for their
[1:21:29] fellow man this was right before the
[1:21:32] veil this was there's the there there
[1:21:34] was nothing that separated uh uh uh uh
[1:21:37] uh the the golden altar from The Mercy
[1:21:40] Seat except for that
[1:21:43] Veil and that high priest would offer
[1:21:46] that he would offer it unto the Lord and
[1:21:50] walk into that Veil where the shika
[1:21:53] presence was at now so when he's talking
[1:21:56] about the Gentiles everywhere are going
[1:22:00] to be offering up incense it's talking
[1:22:02] about the veil being rent away it would
[1:22:06] no longer be an Earthly Tabernacle in
[1:22:09] Jerusalem but now there would be amen
[1:22:12] the veil removed and you and I could
[1:22:16] offer incense of prayer and
[1:22:21] praise
[1:22:25] you would offer it on the behalf of your
[1:22:28] fellow brother your fellow sister
[1:22:34] you the high priest was the only one
[1:22:36] that was able to do that but when Christ
[1:22:39] through his blood it was so powerful
[1:22:42] that it didn't just bring him in it
[1:22:43] brought you
[1:22:45] in Oh Glory to God Amen therefore there
[1:22:50] in 2 uh Corinthians 2:15 it says we are
[1:22:53] unto God a sweet smelling Savor of
[1:22:58] Christ and then that are saved and in
[1:23:01] them that
[1:23:02] perish you understand what I'm saying
[1:23:05] amen Sanctified
[1:23:08] now I I I I want us to think about that
[1:23:12] because what the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:13] has done it has taken away the middle
[1:23:16] wall of petition it has taken away the
[1:23:18] sin out of our Lives Hallelujah to where
[1:23:21] you and I can now stand in that Priestly
[1:23:25] realm amen stand before God and offer
[1:23:30] offer the blood for our brother offer
[1:23:33] prayer for our brother offer prayer for
[1:23:36] the sinner amen we can stand as an
[1:23:38] intercessor now we're not doing away
[1:23:41] with the with with with with the uh
[1:23:43] Brazen altar or the Brazen leather but
[1:23:45] we have been Sanctified and now we can
[1:23:49] come into the presence of God Amen we
[1:23:52] don't have to just pray uh uh uh uh just
[1:23:55] to lay me down to sleep prayer amen but
[1:23:57] now we've got the Priestly garments on
[1:24:01] that pre that that Priestly garment was
[1:24:03] one amen that had all of the of the 12
[1:24:07] Stones for the tribe that the
[1:24:09] representing all of Israel the 12 tribes
[1:24:11] of Israel and they would take the blood
[1:24:13] he would take that lamb and they would
[1:24:16] come before God Amen representing all of
[1:24:20] those ones amen it was dear to his heart
[1:24:22] it was the weight that was upon his
[1:24:24] chest amen and he would be representing
[1:24:27] those that could not come into the
[1:24:29] presence of God Amen they weren't able
[1:24:32] to come maybe am mean they weren't
[1:24:33] allowed to come but you see you as a
[1:24:37] spiritual priest before God you can
[1:24:40] carry the weight of your brother and
[1:24:43] your sister the load of the world and
[1:24:45] you can come before father God and he
[1:24:48] will grant your
[1:24:51] request
[1:24:53] a privilege now no one else was going to
[1:24:56] that privilege of wearing that
[1:25:00] ought no one else was granted that
[1:25:02] privilege of the burden upon the
[1:25:06] shoulders like Aaron was but through the
[1:25:10] offering of Jesus Christ he has brought
[1:25:12] you and me into that privilege of where
[1:25:16] of of of of of carrying that burden oh
[1:25:20] bless the name of the Lord
[1:25:22] amen he goes
[1:25:25] oh he says there's he says my uh my aunt
[1:25:30] most um he's talking about Abraham he
[1:25:33] says now Abraham my son I'm going I'm
[1:25:36] going to show you that it's not going to
[1:25:37] be nothing that you have to do I'm going
[1:25:40] to do it anyhow I'm determined to save
[1:25:42] man regardless and God is going to do it
[1:25:45] by his grace he will do it and when I
[1:25:47] think of that it makes me just want to
[1:25:48] scream I think oh nothing I could do
[1:25:50] nothing but the blood of Jesus I haven't
[1:25:53] got nothing to offer nothing I My Utmost
[1:25:55] righteousness to to yours would be
[1:25:57] filthy uh filthy rags in his sight so
[1:26:01] I'm a sinner to begin with and there's
[1:26:02] nothing I can do about it but something
[1:26:05] he could do and he took his son's blood
[1:26:07] and covered it over me like that so that
[1:26:09] he sees me as a righteous man because
[1:26:11] his blood his son's blood has made me
[1:26:14] righteous now I can come in before the
[1:26:17] Throne of God and pray for my
[1:26:20] brother oh God

[1:26:26] love as Christ has also loved us and has

[1:28:29] walking in before
[1:28:32] God our morning time prayers is a
[1:28:35] privilege not a
[1:28:37] duty our evening prayer should be a
[1:28:40] privilege and not a
[1:28:42] duty
[1:28:44] Ministry should be a
[1:28:47] privilege and not a
[1:28:49] duty can you say man
[1:28:52] now am man that altar of incense was was
[1:28:56] an incredible
[1:28:58] thing now there in 1 Peter 2 and 5 it
[1:29:02] says ye also as Lively stones are built
[1:29:05] up a spiritual house a holy priesthood
[1:29:08] to offer up spiritual
[1:29:10] sacrifices
[1:29:12] acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:29:16] Christ
[1:29:18] now I I I I I I love that there in psms
[1:29:22] 141 David says Lord I cry unto thee make
[1:29:26] haste unto me give give ear unto my
[1:29:28] voice when I cry unto thee let my prayer
[1:29:31] be set forth before thee as incense and
[1:29:34] the lifting of my hands as the evening
[1:29:36] sacrifice can you say Amen now this
[1:29:40] priest was to it was to be a Perpetual
[1:29:44] offering of incense and other words all
[1:29:47] time it would be endless never ending
[1:29:50] without ceasing that's what prep
[1:29:51] Perpetual
[1:29:53] means and that's the reason why first
[1:29:56] Thessalonians uh uh 5:1 17 says pray
[1:30:00] without
[1:30:02] ceasing pray without ceasing amen this
[1:30:05] is this is this is something that is
[1:30:08] what God has has ordained for us to do
[1:30:12] is to come in to his
[1:30:18] presence not without
[1:30:20] blood but we had to come into His
[1:30:24] presence with blood for our fellow
[1:30:34] man Jesus had to become a
[1:30:38] man to
[1:30:40] feel the
[1:30:42] pain of
[1:30:45] humanity Jesus could not be a
[1:30:49] minister until he become
[1:30:54] human only then could he feel our pain
[1:30:58] experience the headaches experience what
[1:31:01] teenagers go through what M and daddies
[1:31:04] go through he experienced this and then
[1:31:07] and then only could he become a faithful
[1:31:12] priest unto God that's

[1:32:15] human to talk with a
[1:32:18] human so God had just came
[1:32:22] and revealed himself to
[1:32:24] Abraham and Abraham fed God in a
[1:32:29] body and then when God is sitting there
[1:32:32] God says
[1:32:34] listen sodom's fixing to burn and then
[1:32:36] Abraham looked to God in flesh and says
[1:32:39] listen if if there's 50 and he begin to
[1:32:42] intercede for for lot amen begin to
[1:32:46] intercede if there's 40 if there's if
[1:32:48] there on and on he went and and and and
[1:32:51] and now lot was never given the
[1:32:52] Revelation but because of the
[1:32:54] intercession of

[1:38:00] people when they made the golden calf
[1:38:02] and he threw himself before the the
[1:38:04] wrath of God and acted as a intercessor
[1:38:06] for the people and he says God you're
[1:38:08] going to have to take me right along
[1:38:11] with the
[1:38:12] people Moses could have said that's a
[1:38:14] good I'm so happy this congregation has

[1:38:48] against them that I may consume them and
[1:38:51] I will make thee a great nation and
[1:38:55] Moses besought the Lord his God and said
[1:38:59] Lord why do thy wrath Wax Hot against
[1:39:01] thy people which thou Hast brought out
[1:39:04] of the land of Egypt with great power
[1:39:05] and with a mighty hand wherefore should
[1:39:07] the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief
[1:39:09] did he bring them out to slay them in
[1:39:12] the mountains and consume them from the
[1:39:13] face of the
[1:39:14] Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and

[1:39:46] land that I have spoken I will give unto
[1:39:48] your seed and they shall inherit
[1:39:51] forever and the 14th verse let's all

[1:41:12] called you to stand in the gap for your
[1:41:15] fellow
[1:41:19] man who cares if they say it the way I
[1:41:22] see
[1:41:28] it the heartbeat of God reflected
[1:41:32] through
[1:41:36] you it's a
[1:41:38] privilege of being
[1:41:42] burdened it's a
[1:41:46] privilege to lay down my
[1:41:49] life for the cause of Jesus
[1:41:54] Christ some of us can't
[1:41:57] even lay down our selfish burden to go
[1:42:01] help another
[1:42:03] brother some of us can't even come and
[1:42:05] help molon at the
[1:42:08] church some of us can't even help we
[1:42:12] some of us
[1:42:13] have we're burdened but it ain't sure it
[1:42:16] ain't the work of
[1:42:18] God you see what's the lawn to the
[1:42:20] church
[1:42:21] what's what what is the lawn what what
[1:42:23] what is helping I mean come on this is
[1:42:24] all
[1:42:26] natural what would this church be if
[1:42:29] everyone served God like
[1:42:35] you or I'll do it on my own terms what
[1:42:38] happened to
[1:42:40] Brotherhood and
[1:42:47] Ministry I've Got a Feeling
[1:42:52] when you've got a
[1:42:59] feeling it ain't a title you know
[1:43:05] Pastor so
[1:43:07] Pastor is only going to do Pastor work
[1:43:10] sitting behind the desk and coming up
[1:43:12] and delivering flowery
[1:43:15] messages
[1:43:17] no Pastor is first of all
[1:43:22] a mer a a a a servant fulfilling a
[1:43:30] Ministry deacons and trustees and
[1:43:33] pastors and five-fold Ministry these are
[1:43:35] all wonderful
[1:43:36] titles but they're
[1:43:39] nothing unless first of
[1:43:42] all it beats
[1:43:47] here amen got the heart in the wrong
[1:43:49] place it's got to beat
[1:43:55] here but I say take away all the
[1:43:58] titles push the titles aside you know
[1:44:02] what makes a church a
[1:44:03] church not the
[1:44:07] pastor you know what makes the church a
[1:44:09] church not the five-fold
[1:44:11] ministry we're just here for for the
[1:44:14] growth and the maturity in the word and
[1:44:16] God gives us gifts to guide but the
[1:44:19] church is you
[1:44:23] the church is me without all the titles
[1:44:26] we are the body of Jesus
[1:44:31] Christ skip the titles I don't want a
[1:44:34] title I want to be a
[1:44:36] Christian I want the love of God to flow
[1:44:40] through
[1:44:48] me am I beating a dead
[1:44:53] horse I'm not saying we don't have
[1:44:56] Ministry I'm
[1:44:58] saying that weight that you've got it's
[1:45:01] a
[1:45:05] privilege brother Brandon would say
[1:45:08] now look at Moses when he come to a time
[1:45:12] that he displayed all his life was
[1:45:15] the displayed all of his life was the
[1:45:18] spirit of Christ for Christ was in him
[1:45:22] Christ was in Moses by measure now we
[1:45:25] notice that he was born in the time of
[1:45:27] persecution children was killed to try
[1:45:29] to get into
[1:45:31] him try to get him just exactly like
[1:45:34] they did Jesus and we find out that when
[1:45:36] he come to a place that the children of
[1:45:38] Israel had disobeyed in such a way until
[1:45:41] God was angry with them and he said to
[1:45:44] Moses step aside and I'll destroy the
[1:45:45] whole group of them and I'll take you
[1:45:46] and raise up another generation Moses
[1:45:49] threw himself in the path of God's
[1:45:50] judgment and said take me before you
[1:45:52] take them in other words before you can
[1:45:55] get to them you'll have to come over
[1:45:57] me that's just exactly what Jesus Christ
[1:46:00] did when God would have wiped the whole
[1:46:02] face of the Earth off with these Sinners
[1:46:05] you and I Christ threw himself in the
[1:46:07] path and God could not do it he couldn't
[1:46:11] come over his own son when God seen that
[1:46:13] spirit in Moses hanging in the Judgment
[1:46:15] like a cross he says you can't come to
[1:46:18] them you'll have to take me first' and
[1:46:20] then the spirit of God and Moses when
[1:46:23] when he could have been the king of
[1:46:26] Egypt when he could have had the luxury
[1:46:29] every luxury in the world to be popular
[1:46:31] when he could have been the great king
[1:46:33] of the world at the time and he chose to
[1:46:34] suffer the persecution and the
[1:46:36] Affliction for he esteemed the reproach
[1:46:38] of Christ greater riches than that of
[1:46:40] Egypt so he threw himself in the way why
[1:46:42] it was God in Moses did that normal
[1:46:46] thinking intellectual men would never do
[1:46:48] that he would take the easy Road no
[1:46:52] matter how much of a fanatic Moses
[1:46:54] seemed to be he was trying you see he
[1:46:56] had a he had a true he was a true
[1:46:58] prophet of God because he was trying to
[1:47:00] achieve something for the
[1:47:03] kingdom of
[1:47:05] God on down he says now he says I want
[1:47:08] to show you what a man is before
[1:47:11] God how core and all these notice when
[1:47:13] God told Moses step aside I'm going to
[1:47:16] destroy the whole bunch of them and make
[1:47:18] you a nation Moses threw himself in
[1:47:20] front of God he bridged his way and he
[1:47:23] said God take me God cannot cross that
[1:47:27] man a power of a saint before
[1:47:37] God the
[1:47:41] power of a
[1:47:48] saint it's the more powerful than Angels
[1:47:51] Angels can't
[1:47:53] intercede the seraphim couldn't
[1:47:54] intercede they were the throne guards
[1:47:56] but they couldn't intercede they were
[1:47:58] shouting holy holy holy holy Lord God
[1:48:01] Almighty but that song becomes
[1:48:05] secondary the Bible says when the seven
[1:48:07] seal was opened up there was silence in
[1:48:09] heaven there was something that was
[1:48:10] beginning to take
[1:48:12] place because underneath that was the
[1:48:14] redeemed of God underneath that there
[1:48:16] was something brother bam says everyone
[1:48:19] stopped
[1:48:23] now everyone's
[1:48:24] attention is looking on the earth
[1:48:27] because there is a bride in full
[1:48:31] maturity the mystery of God is living in
[1:48:34] human beings the power of God is living
[1:48:39] in
[1:48:41] you can you say
[1:48:47] Amen
[1:48:48] now he say I believe the reason we don't
[1:48:51] have desperation is because of the lack
[1:48:53] of
[1:48:55] love God the love of God I think that
[1:48:59] the love of God causes desperation if
[1:49:02] God is in you the token inside of you
[1:49:04] and you see the conditions of the times
[1:49:07] and the people waiting in the Sin the
[1:49:08] way they the way they are it'll throw
[1:49:11] you in desperation I just believe it
[1:49:15] will he says you can you can't be
[1:49:18] desperate till God speaks to you
[1:49:21] oh Church
[1:49:23] rise Shake Yourself pink your conscience
[1:49:26] wake yourself up in this
[1:49:28] hour we must be desperate or perish
[1:49:30] there is coming forth something from the
[1:49:32] Lord I know it says thus saith the Lord
[1:49:35] there is coming forth something and we
[1:49:38] better be desperate it's between life
[1:49:39] and death it'll pass through us and we
[1:49:43] won't see
[1:49:46] it can you say
[1:49:49] Amen now this is after the seals had
[1:49:52] taken
[1:49:56] place the Satan wanting what is Satan
[1:49:59] going to do is Satan going to let you
[1:50:01] come and intercede
[1:50:03] easily and the musicians can
[1:50:11] come is he going to let you before the
[1:50:13] throne
[1:50:15] easily I think we've got
[1:50:19] plenty
[1:50:21] of scripture to say that it doesn't come
[1:50:28] easily we look at
[1:50:30] Zechariah the third chapter and the
[1:50:32] first verse
[1:50:35] and and it says and he showed me Joshua
[1:50:37] the high priest standing before the
[1:50:38] angel of the Lord and Satan standing on
[1:50:40] his right hand to
[1:50:42] resist oppose
[1:50:47] him now he was a wonderful priest
[1:50:52] Joshua was a wonderful
[1:50:54] priest the Bible says that he would
[1:50:56] there as he stood before the Lord his
[1:50:58] clothes were tattered and torn and
[1:51:01] filthy
[1:51:02] and he had been standing there for the
[1:51:07] people and he was weary he was
[1:51:11] tired he was a wonderful
[1:51:14] priest and he needed a
[1:51:17] priest and God stood for him when he was
[1:51:20] tired and weary the next verse second
[1:51:23] verse and the Lord said unto
[1:51:26] Satan the
[1:51:30] Lord rebuke thee Oh Satan even the Lord
[1:51:33] that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke
[1:51:38] thee is not this a brand plucked out of
[1:51:40] the
[1:51:41] fire go to the
[1:51:44] next and Joshua was clothed with filthy
[1:51:47] garments and stood before the
[1:51:48] angel and he answered and spake unto
[1:51:51] those that stood before him and said
[1:51:52] take away the filthy garments from
[1:51:54] him he's been an
[1:51:57] interceder he has stood for intercession
[1:52:00] now I'm going to intercede for him take
[1:52:02] away the filthy
[1:52:03] garments and unto him he said behold I
[1:52:06] have watched thine iniquity pass from
[1:52:09] thee and I will clothe
[1:52:13] thee with a change of
[1:52:17] reignment and I said let them set a fair
[1:52:20] miter up on his head and so they set a
[1:52:22] fair miter up on his head and clothed
[1:52:24] him with garments and the angel of the
[1:52:27] Lord stood
[1:52:29] by you remember the S saraph phenician
[1:52:32] woman she was a gentile Jesus said been
[1:52:36] as brother Brandon
[1:52:39] would give the
[1:52:41] drama Jesus was wore out he was trying
[1:52:44] to rest he was so
[1:52:48] tired
[1:52:50] the disciples were standing guard Peter
[1:52:53] was standing there and saying you can't
[1:52:54] see the
[1:52:56] master she says I've got
[1:53:02] to my daughter's
[1:53:07] dying the only one I can get to he's the
[1:53:10] only one that can do
[1:53:13] it he said
[1:53:15] no but she finally somehow got by him
[1:53:17] and then there was there was Andrew
[1:53:19] standing there said we told you
[1:53:22] no she said I got to get I got to get to
[1:53:28] him she's my only
[1:53:32] daughter I got to get
[1:53:37] help she pushed past all those obstacles
[1:53:40] and then when she gets to
[1:53:41] Jesus Jesus just being cranky
[1:53:47] supposedly said I've not come for you
[1:53:49] dogs
[1:53:51] I've come for
[1:53:53] Israel just just go on I I my Ministry
[1:53:57] is not for you Gentiles that'll come but
[1:54:00] not
[1:54:02] today she dropped to her knees she said
[1:54:05] it is true I'm a
[1:54:07] dog I'll Grant it but even the dogs get
[1:54:10] the crumbs from the master's
[1:54:18] table it was the
[1:54:21] heart reaching out for somebody
[1:54:25] else Jesus stopped turning around and
[1:54:28] said oh I've not seen so great a faith
[1:54:30] in all
[1:54:31] Israel he said go go your way and you'll
[1:54:35] find it as you have
[1:54:40] believed and her daughter was
[1:54:47] whole it's not easy
[1:54:51] the life of a
[1:54:55] servant is not sitting in the high
[1:54:57] places and receiving
[1:54:59] honor the life of a servant is
[1:55:02] caring and
[1:55:04] loving and
[1:55:07] giving giving and giving and giving for
[1:55:10] the sake of somebody
[1:55:14] else that's their whole purpose is to
[1:55:17] give for somebody else
[1:55:29] other things are just
[1:55:31] titles they're servants at
[1:55:37] heart and God hears the request he'll
[1:55:41] hear the request to you
[1:55:43] youngans something about a burd in heart
[1:55:46] caring for
[1:55:48] somebody you'll
[1:55:50] remember you'll remember when brother
[1:55:52] Bram Angel of the
[1:55:56] Lord told the woman says you're healed
[1:56:00] someone
[1:56:01] else's you were healed while ago or
[1:56:04] something of that
[1:56:05] nature he says get up off the
[1:56:10] bed and when she got up it was brother
[1:56:12] bram's own
[1:56:14] daughter his little
[1:56:17] girl that had been kneeling beside the
[1:56:19] woman that was
[1:56:22] dying she was a long ways away from
[1:56:24] brother brandham he couldn't see but she
[1:56:27] was praying and the spirit of the Lord
[1:56:29] came upon the prophet and told him said
[1:56:31] you're
[1:56:32] healed he said it was
[1:56:35] her God heard her
[1:56:42] prayer oh don't let no other burden be
[1:56:46] on your shoulders than the burden of
[1:56:52] Ministry for this purpose have I come
[1:56:55] into the
[1:57:01] world for this purpose to seek and to
[1:57:03] save that which is
[1:57:05] lost and at this mind of Christ being in
[1:57:08] you who thought it not robbery to be
[1:57:10] equal with God but made himself of no
[1:57:12] reputation be he he become obedient unto
[1:57:15] death he gave of himself so that he
[1:57:17] could win a world
[1:57:26] just remember when you've got your
[1:57:30] burden there's a lot of Natural Things
