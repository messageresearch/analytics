[31:48] Do you love him here tonight?
[31:51] We've got a special service here this
[31:54] evening. We we're going to have we're
[31:56] going to hear from a bunch of preachers
[31:58] tonight. And uh I love these kind of
[32:01] services and and so brother Kobe is is h
[32:06] going to start the service out this
[32:07] evening. And and um so we we want you to
[32:11] uh just pull on the gifts of God in all
[32:13] of these brothers lives. And um Amen.
[32:17] There is no telling what God is going to
[32:19] do here in our midst here tonight.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that?
[32:24] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we get we get things
[32:26] in a certain pattern and we get
[32:28] accustomed to it. So, I like these kind
[32:29] of services because we it sort of mixes
[32:32] things up, gets you off uh what you're
[32:35] thinking. What are you doing up there
[32:37] leading songs? Amen. And uh
[32:42] and and uh it's been a long time since
[32:45] I've led songs. Amen. But uh uh we just
[32:49] thought we'd just just just totally
[32:51] break it up tonight. But as as brother
[32:54] Kobe comes to deliver the word of the
[32:56] Lord to us tonight, why don't we just
[32:58] sing it? Give myself away.
[33:06] Give myself.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. If that's your desire tonight.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you have your
[33:33] Bibles,
[33:35] like to turn to a familiar passage of
[33:38] scripture, Psalms 150 and1. We um last
[33:42] time we spoke, we talked along these
[33:44] lines and we're just going to continue
[33:46] along that thought on praise if we can
[33:49] tonight. But Psalms 150 and verse 1-6.
[33:54] Amen. Do you love him here tonight?
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] Says, "Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in
[34:01] his sanctuary.
[34:03] Praise him in the firmament of his
[34:05] power.
[34:06] Praise him for his mighty acts. Praise
[34:09] him according to his excellent
[34:10] greatness.
[34:12] Praise him with the sound of the
[34:13] trumpet. Praise him with the psalm tree
[34:16] and harp. Praise him with the timal and
[34:19] dance. Praise him with the string
[34:21] instruments and organ. Praise him upon
[34:24] the loud symbols. Praise him upon the
[34:26] high sounding symbols. Let everything
[34:29] that hath breath praise ye the Lord.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, you may be seated.
[34:35] Can we turn to one more passage of
[34:36] scripture, Psalms 22 and 22.
[34:40] And we're going to keep this this brief
[34:41] here tonight. And um let everyone else
[34:44] have my time. Amen. But I'm looking
[34:46] forward to it tonight. Amen.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Psalms 22 and 22 says, "I will declare
[34:52] thy name unto my brethren. In the midst
[34:55] of the congregation will I praise thee.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; I was thinking on this topic what is
[35:01] praise and the definition for praise is
[35:04] to express approval or admiration of or
[35:08] to honor in words. Praise it can be a a
[35:12] honest heartfelt expression of of God's
[35:15] greatness and majesty. Amen. Psalms 22:3
[35:20] says, "But thou art holy, oh thou that
[35:23] inhabitest the praises of Israel." Jesus
[35:27] says here that after this man, I pray ye
[35:30] our father which art in heaven.
[35:32] Hallowed, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[35:35] kingdom come, thy will be done in earth
[35:37] in this earth. Amen as it is in heaven.
[35:40] And give us this day our daily bread.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[35:45] debtors. and lead us not into
[35:47] temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[35:49] For thine
[35:51] &gt;&gt; is the kingdom
[35:52] &gt;&gt; and the power
[35:53] &gt;&gt; and the glory forever. Amen and amen. So
[35:57] Jesus is showing us here that when when
[36:00] we begin to pray and when we end our
[36:02] prayer, give him thanks for what he's
[36:04] done for us.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Give him praise for who he truly is.
[36:07] Amen. Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; I love it here that praise I it's
[36:12] something that
[36:15] you may not feel like it in the moment.
[36:17] Praising the Lord.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; I love how praise IS IS SOMETHING THAT
[36:21] YOU HAVE TO PUSH PAST what you're
[36:24] dealing with at the moment.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Praise is something that THAT THAT IS
[36:28] NOT LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE. IT'S
[36:30] NOT LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH
[36:32] IN THE MOMENT, BUT IT IT'S SOMETHING
[36:34] THAT SAYS, GOD, YOU DESERVE THE GLORY
[36:36] EVEN WHEN I DON'T FEEL LIKE GIVING IT.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; AND GOD, YOU DESERVE THE PRAISE EVEN
[36:41] WHEN I DON'T SEE MY HEALING OR I DON'T
[36:44] SEE THE ANSWER THAT I'M LOOKING FOR. I
[36:47] DON'T SEE MY CHILDREN COMING BACK TO GOD
[36:48] YET. AND YET, YOU BEGIN TO GIVE HIM
[36:51] PRAISE FOR WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T PRAISE GOD WHEN
[36:56] THINGS ARE JUST GOOD, BUT YOU PRAISE GOD
[36:58] WHEN THINGS ARE BAD AS WELL.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE TRUE PRAISE COMES FROM. WE
[37:04] CAN PRAISE GOD WHEN MONEY IS IN THE
[37:06] ACCOUNT. AND WE CAN PRAISE GOD WHEN
[37:08] HEALING IS UPON OUR BODY. BUT WHAT ABOUT
[37:11] PRAISING GOD WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF
[37:13] A CIRCUMSTANCE OR A TRIAL?
[37:16] &gt;&gt; HEAR WHAT BROTHER JOHN'S BEEN DEALING
[37:18] WITH WITH HIS JOB.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE CAN PRAISE GOD BECAUSE
[37:22] GOD ALREADY HAS THE ANSWER FOR WHAT HE
[37:25] HAS NEED OF HERE TONIGHT.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE COME AND PRAISE THE LORD
[37:29] BECAUSE WE PRAISE A GOD THAT HAS NEVER
[37:32] EVER EVER FAILED US YET.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; I love that song. IT SAYS, "LIFT YOUR
[37:39] HEAD.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; MORNING IS COMING. There's more to the
[37:42] story. Don't forget that in grief and in
[37:46] glory, STILL GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS.
[37:49] YES.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; STILL GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS. EVEN
[37:52] WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL HIS PRESENCE, STILL
[37:54] GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS. EVEN EVEN
[37:57] WHEN WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
[37:59] SURROUNDED BY THE ENEMY, YOU CAN PRAISE
[38:01] HIM AND SAY, "LORD, YOU MAY NEVER DO
[38:03] ANOTHER THING FOR ME AGAIN." BUT STILL
[38:05] GREAT,
[38:06] &gt;&gt; STILL GREAT IS HIS FAITHFULNESS BECAUSE
[38:09] GOD IS FAITHFUL WHETHER WE ARE OR NOT,
[38:11] FRIENDS.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS. YEAH. YEAH.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; WE'RE BASED OFF EMOTIONS,
[38:20] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS NOT BASED OFF EMOTIONS.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; HE'S FAITHFUL WHEN WE'RE NOT.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; GOD IS ALWAYS THERE WHEN WE FORSAKE HIM.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NEVER LEFT US ALONE.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm I'm thankful for that here
[38:35] tonight.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; DAVID SAYS HERE, "BUT I TRUST IN THY
[38:40] MERCY
[38:42] &gt;&gt; AND MY HEART SHALL REJOICE IN THY
[38:44] SALVATION. AND I WILL SING UNTO THE LORD
[38:47] BECAUSE HE HAS DEALT BOUNTIFULLY WITH
[38:50] ME. SO HE'S SAYING THAT IN IN SPITE OF
[38:53] THE TRIALS AND THE BURDENS AND AND
[38:55] DISAPPOINTMENTS IN LIFE, YOU STILL GOT
[38:57] TO PRAISE UPON YOUR HEART.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST UPON YOUR LIPS, BUT IT'S
[39:02] SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM THE DEPTHS OF
[39:05] THE HEART. AMEN.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER DAY AS WE SPOKE
[39:08] ON THIS THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN WHERE THE
[39:11] SONG HAS COME FROM, BUT YOU BEGIN TO
[39:14] PRAISE HIM ANYWAY.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS. OH MY.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT OF A LOSS IT MAY
[39:22] HAVE BEEN, THERE IS STILL SOMETHING
[39:24] THERE. IT'S NOT BASED UPON YOUR
[39:27] EMOTIONAL STATE.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; PRAISE DOESN'T REQUIRE THE ABSENCE OF
[39:32] TROUBLE.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. AS LONG AS WE'RE IN THIS
[39:36] FLESH, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLES
[39:39] &gt;&gt; AND TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS.
[39:42] BUT DO NOT DESPAIR. THERE IS NOTHING
[39:45] THAT CAN TAKE YOU DOWN. YOU MAY BE
[39:47] SURROUNDED.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE SURROUNDED, BUT THERE'S
[39:51] NOTHING THAT CAN TAKE YOUR PRAISE HERE
[39:54] TONIGHT.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN TAKE YOUR
[39:57] WORSHIP AND YOUR GRATITUDE TO THE GOD
[39:59] THAT LEFT EVERYTHING FOR YOU.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. THAT GAVE EVERYTHING FOR
[40:04] YOU HERE TONIGHT.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE HEART THAT
[40:08] THAT IT BEGINS TO BUBBLE OVER.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS THE
[40:13] STORY ABOUT THE BUBBLING BROOK and he he
[40:15] he goes to the brook AND ASKS THE BROOK
[40:17] AND WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO BUBBLY?
[40:19] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; IS IS IT BECAUSE THAT THE DEER DRINK
[40:21] FROM YOU? HE'S LIKE, "NO."
[40:23] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; HE'S LIKE, "WELL, MAYBE IS IT BECAUSE
[40:25] THAT THIS ANIMAL DRINKS FROM YOU?" HE
[40:27] SAYS, "NO." HE SAID, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT
[40:29] ME? I DRINK FROM YOU." YEAH.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; HE'S LIKE, "NO, THAT'S THE THAT'S NOT
[40:32] THE CASE AT ALL." HE'S SAYING, "THERE'S
[40:34] JUST SOMETHING THAT'S PUSHING FROM THE
[40:37] INWARD OUT.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; HE CAN'T CONTROL IT. HE CAN'T EXPLAIN
[40:41] IT. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN THE
[40:43] HEART." AND THAT'S HOW WE ARE AS
[40:45] CHRISTIANS. WE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; We We IT'S A WE CAN'T GIVE AN
[40:50] EXPLANATION OF WHY WE PRAISE GOD WHEN WE
[40:53] DO. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
[40:55] &gt;&gt; ON THE INSIDE THAT'S PUSHING PAST
[40:57] FEELINGS, PUSHING PAST EMOTIONS, PUSHING
[41:01] PAST HARDSHIPS, AND SAY, "I WILL GIVE
[41:03] GOD THE PRAISE HE DESERVES."
[41:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; As that song says, PRAISE OPENS PRISON
[41:15] DOORS.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN SEE THAT WITH PAUL AND SILAS.
[41:18] HOW THEY WERE IN THE MIDNIGHT HOUR.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[41:21] THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BE DISCOURAGED.
[41:23] COME ON NOW. THEY'RE THEY WERE IN CHAINS
[41:25] AND FEATHERS IN A DARK DUNGEON.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BE DISCOURAGED.
[41:29] THEY THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO FEEL
[41:30] FORSAKEN AND ALL ALONE. BUT THESE GROUP
[41:33] OF MEN KNEW THAT IF THEY COULD PRAISE
[41:36] GOD, THEY COULD PRAISE THEIR WAY OUT OF
[41:38] THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; AND THEY BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD. AND
[41:42] IF I CAN SAY THIS, BROTHER MERL, THAT
[41:44] WAS THE ORIGINAL JAIL HOUSE ROCK RIGHT
[41:46] THERE.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ELVIS HAD NOTHING ON THEM.
[41:49] AMEN.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; THEY BEGIN TO PRAISE THE LORD. AND WHAT
[41:52] HAPPENED? THE WALLS BEGIN TO SHAKE.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; THE FEATHERS THAT HELD THEM BEGIN TO
[41:58] FALL DOWN AND HIT THE GROUND. WHY?
[42:00] BECAUSE PRAISE. PRAISE. GOD IS LOOKING
[42:02] FOR SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO PRAISE THEM
[42:05] NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE HERE TONIGHT
[42:10] THAT IS GOING TO PUSH PAST UNBELIEF,
[42:12] PUSH PAST THE STRUGGLE, AND SAY, "GOD, I
[42:15] PRAISE YOU."
[42:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:19] WHEN YOUR FAITH IS IN GOD, YOU CAN
[42:22] PRAISE HIM. YOU CAN SING A SONG OF
[42:24] PRAISE. HALLELUJAH.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; DAVID SAID HERE, I LOVE THIS SCRIPTURE
[42:28] AS I'M ALMOST DONE. HE SAYS, "CAST ME
[42:31] NOT AWAY FROM THY PRESENCE, OH LORD, AND
[42:34] TAKE NOT THY HOLY SPIRIT FROM ME, BUT
[42:37] RESTORE." THAT'S MY PRAYERS, LORD.
[42:39] RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY
[42:43] &gt;&gt; OF THY SALVATION. NOT MY SALVATION, BUT
[42:47] YOURS, LORD.
[42:49] AND UPHOLD ME WITH A FREE SPIRIT. WE GET
[42:52] TIRED OF DEALING WITH LIFE. WE GET WEARY
[42:56] &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH IT ALL A A SONG MAY COME
[42:59] UPON YOUR HEART.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; AND I LOVE THAT SONG, GRATITUDE, BECAUSE
[43:02] THAT MAY BE THE ONLY THING THAT YOU
[43:05] COULD GET OUT OF YOUR MOUTH AT THAT TIME
[43:06] IS LORD, I THROW IN MY HANDS
[43:10] &gt;&gt; AND I PRAISE YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN. YOU
[43:12] KNOW, THAT MAY BE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN
[43:14] DO.
[43:15] MAYBE THE ONLY THING YOU GOT AND YOUR
[43:18] STRUGGLE IS A HALLELUJAH.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; SO I THROW IN MY HANDS.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; There you go, PREACHER.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; I PRAISE YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[43:32] That may be it.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; I know it's not much, Lord.
[43:37] I have nothing else fit for a king
[43:40] except a song of praise. Yes.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; And if I can LEAVE THIS WITH YOU
[43:44] TONIGHT, YOU MAY BE IN THAT SPOT RIGHT
[43:47] NOW.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; AND YOU MAY FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING IS
[43:50] AGAINST YOU RIGHT NOW. YOU MAY FEEL LIKE
[43:53] YOUR BILLS ARE PILING UP OR YOU MAY FEEL
[43:55] LIKE THE DOCTOR'S REPORT IS IS NOT GOOD
[43:58] ENOUGH. IT JUST LEFT YOU DEPRESSED OR
[44:00] DEAL GRANDPA DEALING WITH PARKINSON'S. I
[44:03] CAN'T IMAGINE HIM DEALING WITH THAT YEAR
[44:05] AFTER YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD
[44:06] DO.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; BUT ALL I KNOW IS ON THE HEART OF THESE
[44:10] BELIEVERS.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; YEAH. There's a song
[44:14] &gt;&gt; I just throw in my hands.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; I praise you again and again.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; That's been my cries. Lord, don't let me
[44:25] look at the situation.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; But Lord, let me
[44:31] &gt;&gt; let me push. It's a struggle to push
[44:34] through.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; It's a struggle TO PUSH THROUGH. BUT I
[44:38] PROMISE YOU, ONCE YOU CAN PUSH past
[44:41] that,
[44:42] &gt;&gt; all right.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL MEET YOU RIGHT THERE.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; He has THE ANSWER FOR YOU ALREADY.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME THAT WE LET GO AND PRAISE the
[44:54] Lord.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you here tonight.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[45:06] Hallelujah.
[45:09] It's already done.
[45:13] Praise
[45:14] his name.
[45:16] The battle is over.
[45:20] The victory is won.
[45:24] It's already done. Let's sing it as
[45:27] brother Harry comes. It's already done.
[45:32] Hallelu.
[45:36] It's already done.
[45:40] Praise
[45:41] his name.
[45:43] The battle is over.
[45:47] The victory is won.
[45:51] It's already done.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:04] Glory to God.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and turn our Bibles to
[46:08] Matthew chapter 5.
[46:29] Matthew chapter 5 and starting at verse
[46:32] 23.
[46:34] Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the
[46:37] altar, and there rememberest that thy
[46:39] brother hath ought against thee, leave
[46:41] there thy gift before the altar, and go
[46:44] thy way, first to be reconciled to thy
[46:46] brother, and then come and offer thy
[46:49] gift. And let's go ahead and turn to
[46:51] Matthew chapter 18.
[46:58] Matthew chapter 18 and starting at verse
[47:02] 21.
[47:04] Then came Peter to him and said,"Lord,
[47:07] how often shall my brother sin against
[47:09] me, and I forgive him till seven times?"
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto
[47:14] thee until seven times, but until 70* 7.
[47:21] You know, I
[47:26] was trying to think about
[47:29] what to
[47:33] to preach on, what to to minister on
[47:35] this evening. And,
[47:38] you know, it's something that being
[47:41] humans, we
[47:43] constantly have to
[47:46] deal with people with different
[47:47] personalities than us. Um, and this is
[47:50] even in This is even in the church
[47:52] doors. We're not all clones. We're not
[47:54] all thinking the same thing. We don't
[47:56] all have the same opinions. We all uh
[47:59] have different thoughts on things. We
[48:01] all have different ways of of of
[48:04] handling situations, different ways of
[48:06] of doing things. I mean, you're even
[48:08] going to see tonight there the different
[48:10] styles of ministry that you have between
[48:12] the different brothers and the ways that
[48:14] they uh approach and the way that God
[48:16] has used the gift that's in their lives.
[48:18] And
[48:20] &gt;&gt; it's it's one of those things where as
[48:23] we spend time around our our brothers
[48:25] and sisters and we begin to get that
[48:27] feeling of of commonness,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; we begin to notice more of the things
[48:32] that that bother us, more of the things
[48:34] that that irritate us, more of the
[48:36] things that can
[48:39] make us come into church.
[48:42] and we begin to lose our blessing
[48:44] because we have
[48:47] an issue with somebody.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And now we know that,
[48:54] you know, I was as I was thinking about
[48:55] this, I was thinking about as brother
[48:57] Wendell had talked about all the
[48:58] different events we have coming up this
[49:01] month and different things. And one of
[49:02] the things that we have coming up is our
[49:03] New Year's Eve service. And
[49:05] &gt;&gt; you know, normally for New Year's Eve
[49:07] service, we have communion. And brother
[49:10] Brandon would talk about communion and
[49:13] you know he said
[49:15] in the sermon let your light so shine
[49:18] before men. He says now I thought maybe
[49:20] tonight is communion night and I hear
[49:22] they've had a baptism and going to have
[49:23] another and I like to come down for for
[49:25] communion. I missed it the last time not
[49:27] being here. I missed it and I knew this
[49:29] was the first Sunday. So I made
[49:30] preparation to be here so I could be in
[49:32] communion for tonight. For I truly think
[49:34] it's the duty of every every Christian
[49:36] to take communion. The Bible said, 'If
[49:38] you take this not, you have no part with
[49:40] me. And I believe that this is a
[49:42] showdown time for the Christians. If we
[49:43] do not take it, we have no part with
[49:45] him. And if we take it unworthy, then
[49:47] we're guilty of the body and death of
[49:49] Christ. So it gets to a place where it
[49:52] keeps the Christian prayed up when he
[49:53] comes to communion. We should come
[49:55] reverently, solemnly, sacredly, walking
[49:58] up, confessing all of our wrongs,
[49:59] praying one for another. Not only that,
[50:01] but we should feel if there's a brother
[50:02] or sister among us that we feel is just
[50:05] a little bit out of line somewhere, our
[50:06] hearts ought to be burdened for that
[50:08] person on communion night, especially to
[50:10] see them, that they'll be able to walk
[50:12] up and take communion, not to be
[50:13] condemned with the world because they
[50:15] are our brothers and and our sisters.
[50:18] And you know when you look at the
[50:19] scripture that we read in in Matthew
[50:21] chapter 5 and verse 23,
[50:26] therefore if they thou bring thy gift to
[50:28] the altar and there rememberest that thy
[50:30] brother hath ought against thee.
[50:33] This is not saying if you remember that
[50:36] you have a problem
[50:38] &gt;&gt; with your brother. This is not saying if
[50:41] you come up to worship and realize, oh,
[50:42] I've got bad feelings towards somebody.
[50:44] There's there's someone that I have
[50:46] issues with. that gets dealt with
[50:48] throughout the scriptures. If you deal
[50:50] with the sin in your own life, deal with
[50:52] the beam in your own eye, deal with the
[50:54] all of these different things. But in
[50:57] this scripture he Jesus is telling us if
[51:02] you are coming up to bring your gift to
[51:04] the altar, if you are coming up to offer
[51:06] sacrifice, if you are coming up to
[51:08] worship,
[51:10] if you are coming up to communion, if
[51:14] you are coming up in this time and you
[51:15] remember and you think about the fact
[51:18] that there is a brother or sister that
[51:21] they have a problem with you,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; your conscience is clear. Yeah,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; you're sitting there. You have no
[51:27] problems. You've confessed. You're
[51:29] clear.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Leave your gift at
[51:32] the altar."
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Don't offer it.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Walk away and go be brought back
[51:39] together with your brother.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; This isn't about just going in and
[51:46] going, "Okay, is my heart clean? Am I
[51:48] have I been washed in the blood? Have I
[51:51] confessed everything? Am I clean?" But
[51:52] it's now going into it with the mindset
[51:55] of is my brother and my sister right? Do
[51:59] they have something against me that I
[52:02] can deal with that I can come in and I
[52:05] can have the conversation with them and
[52:08] I can, you know, take the take the blame
[52:11] if that's what's necessary. I can do
[52:13] whatever. I can talk to them. I can
[52:16] confess. I can apologize that their
[52:19] feelings were hurt because of something
[52:21] I said or something I did. I can I can
[52:24] do whatever brother Brandham says in the
[52:26] sermon and thou son of David have mercy
[52:29] on me. He said if I too knew tonight
[52:30] that I had an enemy. I may have I
[52:33] perhaps have but if I do I don't just
[52:35] know who it is. If it was I sure
[52:37] wouldn't go to preaching till I went
[52:39] first and made that right. See if I
[52:41] could get it straightened up because
[52:42] we're not supposed to have anything
[52:44] against anyone. Or if anything we can
[52:46] do, let no one have anything against us.
[52:48] See, now if we don't say if you have
[52:50] ought against a brother, but it says if
[52:52] the brother has ought against thee, see
[52:55] you go to him. If he has ought, that's
[52:57] the way that's why we live a peaceful
[53:00] life.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Wendell made the
[53:04] comment during his sermon this morning.
[53:06] He said, "God cannot bless us until we
[53:09] have fully obeyed."
[53:10] &gt;&gt; All right. It's true.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And we can go into all kinds of areas in
[53:14] our lives to go, okay, have we really
[53:16] fully obeyed? But this is just one that
[53:18] I was thinking about as we were thinking
[53:20] about praise and worship and thinking
[53:22] about communion upcoming and and these
[53:24] different things as we're in this season
[53:26] when we're thinking about the fact that
[53:29] God sent his sacrifice
[53:31] &gt;&gt; to earth to grow up, to minister, to die
[53:35] for us.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and as we're going through this
[53:38] that
[53:40] we are supposed to be
[53:43] willing to step out
[53:45] not because I'm offended
[53:49] &gt;&gt; not because there's something in my life
[53:51] that I need down to go to brother KBY
[53:53] and I need to confess that I did
[53:55] something wrong that there's guilt in my
[53:57] heart that
[53:58] &gt;&gt; that I'm trying to make it right but
[54:01] it's now me going to brother KBY because
[54:04] I'm concerned about his salvation
[54:06] because I'm concerned concerned about is
[54:08] he going to be able to come come up to
[54:09] communion?
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Is brother Caleb is is everything right
[54:15] between us?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Do I know that he has something against
[54:19] me? Well, then I want to take care of it
[54:21] whether I caused it or not,
[54:23] &gt;&gt; whether it's just something that's in
[54:25] his head and I had nothing to do with
[54:27] it. whatever it might be, because I'm
[54:30] caring and loving my brother.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Because I'm more interested in making
[54:35] sure that my brother and sister are
[54:38] right.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; That we're there here together.
[54:42] Yes, we have to make sure of our own
[54:45] salvation. Yes, we have to make sure of
[54:48] everything going on in our lives.
[54:50] Confess it. Deal with it. If there's a
[54:52] besitting sin, deal with it in your
[54:55] life.
[54:56] In no way am I saying we're going to
[54:59] completely ignore our own lives.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; But the scriptures take us beyond that.
[55:04] If I'm at the point where I am clear and
[55:08] I can come up to this communion table
[55:09] and I can take it without any type of
[55:14] reservation, without any type of thought
[55:18] in my heart that maybe I'm not
[55:21] right. Mhm.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Well, then I should be thinking next
[55:24] about, okay, are my brothers and sisters
[55:28] where they should be? Is there anything
[55:30] that I could do to help clear them up
[55:33] for this?
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; You know,
[55:37] we were in a church previously before we
[55:41] moved to Oklahoma. There was one that
[55:44] that my wife and I were in that on
[55:46] communion services,
[55:49] they would actually say,
[55:53] "We're taking 5 minutes, 10 minutes,
[55:55] whatever, you pray. If there is
[55:57] something that you need to deal with,
[56:00] &gt;&gt; deal with it." If that means you step
[56:02] outside the church and you get on your
[56:03] phone and you call somebody, you get it
[56:05] done.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And they would have the music playing
[56:08] quietly. They would have whatever. And
[56:10] it was just
[56:12] This is serious.
[56:15] And that's not necessarily the right
[56:17] thing for every single church. I'm not
[56:19] trying to convince Brother Wendle to do
[56:20] anything here, but it was something that
[56:23] made an impression in me to think about,
[56:25] okay, is everything
[56:28] right?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; And is there anything that I can do to
[56:33] help my brother or sister? Is there
[56:35] something where I'm going, okay, they've
[56:37] been treating me a little differently?
[56:38] They've been they've been acting towards
[56:40] me a little bit differently.
[56:42] I don't know what I did.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; I didn't do anything intentional. So, I
[56:47] don't feel like there's anything that I
[56:49] feel guilty about. There's nothing that
[56:50] I am sitting here going, "Man, I really
[56:53] need to confess this."
[56:55] &gt;&gt; But I still want to go and
[56:57] talk to that brother or talk to that
[56:59] sister because I want to make sure
[57:01] there's nothing coming in between
[57:05] me and them. I want to make sure there's
[57:07] nothing coming in between me and my
[57:09] savior or they and their savior.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Romans 12 and verse 18 says, "If it be
[57:18] possible as much as lith in you, live
[57:20] peacefully, live peaceibly with all
[57:23] men."
[57:26] And brother Brandham, as he was talking
[57:27] in that quote I just read, he said, "You
[57:31] go to him if he has ought." That's why
[57:34] we live peaceful.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It's so easy within the church body.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; For us to
[57:45] almost lose sight of the fact that, oh,
[57:47] we're just we're all Christians. We're
[57:48] all part of the body of Christ. And we
[57:51] begin focusing on those differences in
[57:54] personality and those differences in
[57:56] communication, those differences in
[58:00] parenting styles, those differences in
[58:03] uh worship styles, those differences in
[58:06] communication style, and letting that
[58:09] needle us, letting that bother us,
[58:12] letting that build up a barrier.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Whether it's something that we're going,
[58:17] "Oh, that's all on me." Or whether it's
[58:19] going I need to clear up something to
[58:21] make sure that the channel between me
[58:24] and Brother Wendell are okay.
[58:26] Brother Wendell and I are not clones of
[58:28] each other. We do not think the same
[58:30] way. We do not respond the same way to
[58:32] things. We do not act the same way.
[58:35] And so, I'm sure there are things that I
[58:37] do that bother him in some level.
[58:41] I'm sure there are things that he does
[58:43] that bother me in some level. But God
[58:46] has called both of us and given us both
[58:51] gifts in our lives.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; And he's my brother in Christ. He's my
[58:57] pastor.
[59:00] And so there's
[59:03] a love that goes there to go,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure
[59:09] &gt;&gt; that I'm right, that he's right, and
[59:12] that we're
[59:14] able to enter into that worship, that
[59:16] we're able to enter into that communion.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] In the sermon, he carth for you. Brother
[59:23] Brandham says, "Don't you care enough to
[59:26] submit your life to him, to love him, to
[59:29] go to the streets, to go to your boss,
[59:30] to your neighbor, to everywhere with a
[59:32] sweet, gentle spirit? Separate
[59:34] yourselves from the things of the world
[59:36] and live such a peaceable, sweet life
[59:39] that others will see Jesus in you. Don't
[59:42] you feel that you owe that to him?"
[59:46] There are times when we remember that
[59:49] while we're outside this
[59:52] when we're outside this building, when
[59:54] we're outside this fellowship, when
[59:56] we're on the job site, we'll remember,
[59:57] okay, I've got to be a witness. Okay,
[1:00:00] I'm I'm living a life. I'm I'm I'm
[1:00:02] trying to
[1:00:04] to be an example. I'm trying to express
[1:00:07] Christ.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then we'll get here in the
[1:00:11] midst with our brothers and our sisters
[1:00:13] and we'll allow ourselves to
[1:00:16] maybe speak a little more sharply than
[1:00:18] we should have or maybe allow something
[1:00:20] to to poke us or bother us more than we
[1:00:23] would. I mean,
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; maybe I'm the only one, but when I'm out
[1:00:28] working in the world, I expect them to
[1:00:29] do stuff that are going to irritate me.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And you brush it to the side and go,
[1:00:36] "Okay,
[1:00:39] And in your mind, you're just going,
[1:00:41] "They're not Christians. They don't know
[1:00:42] any better."
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; And then we come into the body of Christ
[1:00:48] where God has placed all these different
[1:00:51] parts, all these different people, all
[1:00:52] these different personalities, all these
[1:00:54] diff different
[1:00:56] types.
[1:01:00] and we give them less leeway
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; than what we're willing to give to the
[1:01:06] strangers that are out there.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; When this is the family of God, this is
[1:01:12] the one that we should be caring for the
[1:01:14] most.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; This is the one that we should be in
[1:01:17] some ways holding ourselves to an even
[1:01:18] higher standard. I should be reflecting
[1:01:21] Christ here more and easier than I can
[1:01:24] out there.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; This isn't the place I get to let down
[1:01:27] and go, "Oh, great. I can act however
[1:01:29] because
[1:01:31] we're all Christians.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; They understand.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; I can be irritating. I can do this. I
[1:01:41] can do that.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; But yet, we're called to
[1:01:48] love our brothers and sisters. We're
[1:01:50] called to to love the body of Christ.
[1:01:53] And like I said at the beginning, we're
[1:01:55] called to love so much that before we
[1:01:59] offer our sacrifice at the altar, before
[1:02:01] we offer our gift at the altar, before
[1:02:03] we enter into that worship,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; that we're willing to go make it right
[1:02:09] for them.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Because we weren't in condemnation as we
[1:02:15] stood there to worship,
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; But as we were standing there, we
[1:02:18] realized, "Oh, wait.
[1:02:21] I think Luke has a problem with me. I
[1:02:24] think I need to go deal with that. I
[1:02:27] think I He's been acting a little
[1:02:29] different lately. I I need to go talk to
[1:02:31] my son for a little bit
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; and make sure that he's good.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And make sure that he's going to be
[1:02:39] okay.
[1:02:42] You know, as we're looking at,
[1:02:45] we've got a few weeks
[1:02:47] before
[1:02:49] our New Year's Eve service and
[1:02:52] communion. We've got some time before
[1:02:54] this.
[1:02:58] Not only should we be examining our own
[1:03:01] lives, as brother Brandham said, this is
[1:03:04] a showdown. We want to make sure that
[1:03:05] everything in our own lives are dealt
[1:03:07] with. We want to make sure that there's
[1:03:08] nothing that stands between me and my
[1:03:10] Lord.
[1:03:13] But then also,
[1:03:15] scriptures tell us, "Look for your
[1:03:18] brothers and sisters."
[1:03:20] Is there something that I can tell
[1:03:23] this person hasn't been speaking to me
[1:03:25] quite the same way they used to? They
[1:03:27] they haven't been connecting quite the
[1:03:29] same way. They they seem to be maybe I'm
[1:03:32] getting a little bit more of a cold
[1:03:33] shoulder. Maybe I'm getting a little
[1:03:34] more of this that.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. And God
[1:03:40] calls us and charges us to go to them
[1:03:42] and make it right.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; It's always amazing as we go through the
[1:03:47] scripture and see how high the standard
[1:03:50] is. The standard isn't just confess and
[1:03:53] make yourself right.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; The standard is love your brother and
[1:03:57] sister to the point that you want to go
[1:04:00] clear up anything that would help to
[1:04:02] make sure that they're right.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; This isn't me going to them and going,
[1:04:05] "Brother Michael, you messed up here.
[1:04:07] you need to confess.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're doing. We're not
[1:04:12] making the situation worse.
[1:04:14] This is me going to brother Michael and
[1:04:16] brother Michael,
[1:04:18] I don't know exactly what I did, but I
[1:04:19] feel like I may have said something or
[1:04:21] done something that that has driven a
[1:04:24] little bit of a wedge between us and I
[1:04:26] just want to clear it up. And I am sorry
[1:04:29] if I've hurt you in some way. I've I'm
[1:04:32] sorry if I said something or did
[1:04:34] something
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; and I just want to make sure that that
[1:04:37] we're good
[1:04:39] and that we can worship together
[1:04:43] because we're called to be a body.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Lord bless y'all.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Fill my way every day
[1:05:03] with love
[1:05:06] as I walk with the heavenly.
[1:05:14] Let me go all the while with a song and
[1:05:21] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:05:28] love. One more time. Fill my way every
[1:05:33] day with love.
[1:05:38] As I walk with the heavenly
[1:05:43] dove,
[1:05:46] let me go all the while with a song and
[1:05:53] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:06:00] love.
[1:06:02] You know, I thought that was as as our
[1:06:05] brother was was mentioning that you know
[1:06:08] there in in Mark 11 and 22 where Jesus
[1:06:14] that those are very famous scriptures
[1:06:17] where Jesus said have faith in God and
[1:06:20] you know and and the faith of God. If
[1:06:24] you speak to this mountain
[1:06:26] uh be moved and cast into the sea and
[1:06:28] doubt not in your heart. I mean that
[1:06:31] that is a third pull uh scripture.
[1:06:34] That's something that that brother
[1:06:36] Brandham loved to use. But I but it was
[1:06:39] connected. And I've always thought that
[1:06:40] as interesting because then you know he
[1:06:43] deals with that in the Mark 11:22 23 24
[1:06:48] and then he goes to 25 and he says and
[1:06:50] when you stand praying
[1:06:53] um forgive and if you have ought against
[1:06:56] any that your father also which is in
[1:06:59] heaven may forgive you your trespass.
[1:07:01] But if you forgive not neither will your
[1:07:04] father which is in heaven forgive your
[1:07:06] trespass. So, so it's it's interesting
[1:07:08] and how that that third pull scripture
[1:07:11] and we we talk about that that third
[1:07:14] pull. Amen. But Jesus is saying this is
[1:07:17] connected with forgiveness and how we we
[1:07:21] don't want to have those as against one
[1:07:23] another. And I think I think it's very
[1:07:25] very true because a lot of us we don't
[1:07:27] we we we feel something and we don't
[1:07:29] want to we don't want to cause a
[1:07:32] commotion or we don't want to cause
[1:07:33] something in someone else. But sometimes
[1:07:35] it's just best to go and say, "Hey, what
[1:07:38] what's if there's something between us,
[1:07:40] let's get that thing right?" Because you
[1:07:42] know what it's going to do? It's going
[1:07:44] to continue to cause a wedge deeper and
[1:07:47] deeper. And that's what Satan wants is
[1:07:50] to bring a wedge between us. And it's
[1:07:52] not your brother and it's not yourself
[1:07:55] that wants a wedge. It is Satan that
[1:07:57] brings these things in. And if we would
[1:08:00] handle it the way that brother uh uh
[1:08:03] Harry brought it here today, I I believe
[1:08:05] that we would all be a lot better off.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] So, as we get ready for brother Miguel
[1:08:14] to come, why don't we sing that? Bind us
[1:08:18] together,
[1:08:20] Lord. bind us
[1:08:23] together
[1:08:25] with cords
[1:08:28] that cannot
[1:08:30] be broken.
[1:08:35] Oh yes. B us
[1:08:39] together
[1:08:40] Lord. B us. God bless you
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; together Lord. bind us
[1:08:49] together
[1:08:51] in love.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this evening?
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; To be bound closer with the Lord
[1:09:02] is your desireful.
[1:09:09] I'm a little nervous.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm sweating, but it's not
[1:09:13] because I'm wearing this. actually,
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; you know, kind of come part of it, you
[1:09:19] know, but if we could, you know, I'd
[1:09:22] like to go ahead and go to
[1:09:25] scripture.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; So, like I said, I'm a little nervous,
[1:09:33] but I'd like to go into a passage of
[1:09:35] scripture here. There uh 1st Samuel the
[1:09:38] 21st.
[1:09:39] Uh yeah, 1st Samuel 21,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And first verse.
[1:09:47] Let's see.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:09:55] you know, I didn't write the verse down,
[1:09:58] but he goes on to the scripture. He
[1:10:00] talks about the sword of the Philistine.
[1:10:03] Um,
[1:10:06] pop it up there. You don't mind. I um,
[1:10:10] you know, Brother Windle had had asked
[1:10:12] us to speak something uh say something
[1:10:15] and you know I had some thoughts there
[1:10:17] on I had some thoughts there on my mind
[1:10:19] and uh and you know I don't know how to
[1:10:23] spell I can't spell that again so word
[1:10:26] searches don't do nothing for me you
[1:10:29] know so you know so I spelled sparrow s
[1:10:32] p r r o w for for a long time trying to
[1:10:35] find it you know and so but there in um
[1:10:38] there in 1 Samuel uh
[1:10:42] let me find it
[1:10:45] Let's see here. You guys just have to
[1:10:47] forgive me. Wrote it down here. And uh
[1:10:52] Samuel 21.
[1:11:00] Is that what it is? 21 verse 9.
[1:11:04] Uh starting there at the ninth verse.
[1:11:16] There it is. Yeah, forgive me. Didn't
[1:11:18] write it down. And it says, "And the
[1:11:21] priest said, the sword of Goliath the
[1:11:22] Philistine whom thou slewest in the
[1:11:25] valley of a law. Behold, it is here
[1:11:28] wrapped in a cloth behind the ephog. If
[1:11:31] thou wil take it, thou will take that
[1:11:33] take it for there is no other save that
[1:11:36] here." And David said, "There is none
[1:11:39] like that. Give it to me." And and David
[1:11:43] arose and fled the day for fear of Saul.
[1:11:46] And he had went to Akesh, the king of
[1:11:48] Gath. And may the Lord just add the
[1:11:51] blessing to the reading of his word. But
[1:11:53] I was actually thinking about this
[1:11:55] passage of scripture uh there in 1
[1:11:57] Samuel talking about the the sword of
[1:11:59] Goliath there and you know their
[1:12:02] remembrance or memory. It's ironic I'm
[1:12:05] talking about that, you know, but memory
[1:12:08] could be very key in our walk with the
[1:12:11] Lord. It uh when I say key, it uh just
[1:12:15] memory itself unlocks quite a bit of
[1:12:17] things. Uh you know, you need memory for
[1:12:20] you keypads to your to your buildings to
[1:12:23] get in. You need memory for scripture
[1:12:25] verses. You know, you need memory for
[1:12:27] spelling. You need memory for just all
[1:12:29] kinds of things, you And there's a lot
[1:12:31] of lot of us that our memory, I'm sure,
[1:12:33] is a little 50/50, you know, but it
[1:12:36] takes memory to be able to kind of keep
[1:12:38] the wheels rolling and be able to keep
[1:12:39] things kind of moving. And and in
[1:12:42] memory, you know, there's a lot of
[1:12:43] things that we retain in life, you know,
[1:12:45] there's a lot of things that uh anybody
[1:12:46] that's in the trades or anybody that's
[1:12:48] in something uh where it requires uh say
[1:12:51] if you're uh you know, if you're
[1:12:53] electrician, there's certain equations
[1:12:54] that you have to remember. If you're a
[1:12:56] plumber, there's certain sizes of pipe
[1:12:57] that you have to remember. air
[1:12:59] conditioning, you know, there's there's
[1:13:01] there's uh all kinds of, you know, sheet
[1:13:03] metal measurements and just all these
[1:13:05] kinds of things. But memory memory
[1:13:07] serves uh a purpose, but it's also a
[1:13:10] two-edged sword. And if we're not
[1:13:11] careful, we can let memory go lean
[1:13:14] toward the worst rather than to lean
[1:13:16] toward the good. And and if we're not
[1:13:18] careful, we'll begin to let the devil
[1:13:20] use memory as a sword against us because
[1:13:23] there's a lot of things uh uh you know,
[1:13:25] every one of us weren't weren't weren't
[1:13:27] just uh uh just peaches when when we
[1:13:29] were born. You know, there was a lot of
[1:13:31] things that we had gone through in life
[1:13:32] to be able to develop the character that
[1:13:34] we have today. And there's a lot of
[1:13:36] trials that we had to go through.
[1:13:38] There's a lot of things that we didn't
[1:13:39] understand, Lord. maybe as a young man
[1:13:41] or as a young woman or as an older man
[1:13:44] or an elderly sister that's been, you
[1:13:47] know, going through things in your life
[1:13:48] and there's certain things that you go
[1:13:50] through that now that you look back and
[1:13:52] you're saying, "Oh Lord, I understand
[1:13:54] why I went through these things and the
[1:13:55] Lord brings those things to your
[1:13:57] remembrance that that way you can
[1:13:59] understand God and be faithful in what
[1:14:02] he's doing." And and you know now
[1:14:04] thinking about this now just trying to
[1:14:05] take this and just attach it there to
[1:14:07] David's life but David was going through
[1:14:10] something in his life you know there was
[1:14:12] situation where he you know he was
[1:14:13] anointed king you know uh uh he was he
[1:14:16] was uh uh you know he'd been brought
[1:14:18] before the people god had delivered him
[1:14:20] from a lion god had delivered him from a
[1:14:22] bear but yet those those situations that
[1:14:24] he had done in his life wasn't wasn't
[1:14:27] for the present but it was for something
[1:14:28] that he was going to be going through in
[1:14:30] the future and there therefore we know
[1:14:32] the story about where David, you know,
[1:14:34] uh Goliath comes up on the scene, you
[1:14:36] know, and Goliath's there standing and
[1:14:38] he's boasting in front of the camp of
[1:14:39] Israel and he's like, you know, we know
[1:14:41] the story about, you know, he defies the
[1:14:43] army of God and that he's, you know, he
[1:14:45] he asked that he brings out a champion
[1:14:47] and that that he do all these certain
[1:14:49] things and the men that stood there for
[1:14:52] days after days after days and and
[1:14:55] couldn't recall the remembrance of what
[1:14:57] God had done year after year after year.
[1:15:01] But for the children of Israel, you
[1:15:03] know, he he delivered them from from
[1:15:05] countless tribes. He delivered them from
[1:15:07] famine. He delivered him he delivered
[1:15:09] them from the time coming from Egypt. He
[1:15:11] had delivered all these things. And now
[1:15:13] you got one man standing in front of an
[1:15:14] army. And and yet you have David, you
[1:15:17] know, David, he comes out and and he
[1:15:19] stands before Goliath and he and he just
[1:15:21] wipes or he not wipes, but he comes out
[1:15:23] with w with with a with a sling and a
[1:15:26] and a couple of rocks and he comes out
[1:15:28] there and he and he stands against a
[1:15:30] giant, a well-trained giant and he he
[1:15:32] just kills this giant and he puts him
[1:15:34] down. You know, we just think that at
[1:15:36] that point that David's going to be
[1:15:37] living there on on the on the
[1:15:39] mountaintop as king. But yet we find out
[1:15:41] that Dave is running for his life. And
[1:15:44] we find out that we find out that Saul
[1:15:46] becomes possessed. We we find out that
[1:15:48] that God all of a sudden he begins to he
[1:15:51] begins to take this joyous moment where
[1:15:53] he's been anointed king and and and all
[1:15:55] the berries and all the bells and
[1:15:57] whistles have been added to him and he
[1:15:58] begins to squeeze on David. And because
[1:16:02] in doing this, David's not quite sure
[1:16:04] what's going on, but he trusts in the
[1:16:06] Lord. And we begin to find him here at
[1:16:08] this moment of where of where David he's
[1:16:10] running for his life. And not only is he
[1:16:12] is he he's talking with the priest. And
[1:16:14] if I remember correctly in the story,
[1:16:16] the priest really is not supposed to be
[1:16:18] talking to David because David's running
[1:16:19] for his life. And and Saul's like,
[1:16:21] "Anybody that talks to him, anybody
[1:16:23] gives him shelter, anybody that gives
[1:16:24] him food, anybody that anybody that does
[1:16:27] anything that helps David, they're going
[1:16:28] to have to answer to me." and and and
[1:16:30] and and this priest now now he's looking
[1:16:33] at David and he and he could see that
[1:16:35] David's in in a situation, but yet and
[1:16:38] so David's like, "Hey, do you have any
[1:16:40] anything that I could use? Anything
[1:16:41] under your hand? Do you do you have any
[1:16:43] weapons?" And and and David at that
[1:16:45] point, he's looking for anything. And
[1:16:48] and the the the the priest begins to
[1:16:50] come out and he and he walks back and he
[1:16:52] says, "I've got something that might be
[1:16:54] of interest." and not his exact words,
[1:16:56] but you know, he I got something that
[1:16:58] might be of interest to you. And all of
[1:17:00] a sudden, he tells him about the sword
[1:17:01] of Goliath and and he tells him that
[1:17:03] that all I've got is this one sword that
[1:17:06] you know, do you remember? You know, and
[1:17:08] I could see the wheels begin to spin in
[1:17:11] the back of David's in the back of
[1:17:12] David's mind. And no doubt, like I said,
[1:17:14] at that moment that he was running for
[1:17:16] his life. At that moment, he was hungry
[1:17:18] because the scripture says that he he's
[1:17:20] asking for the bread that's underneath
[1:17:22] his hand. And he's like, you know, I
[1:17:24] can't give you this bread, you know,
[1:17:26] because it's basically it was a
[1:17:27] sanctified food. And he had asked him
[1:17:29] different things about it before he gave
[1:17:30] it to him, you know, and and he's
[1:17:32] beginning to think about, you know, all
[1:17:34] these things. But yet when he pulls that
[1:17:36] sword out and remembrance begins to come
[1:17:38] to his mind and and he begins to think
[1:17:40] about the time no doubt and these are
[1:17:42] just my words but begins to think about
[1:17:44] the time of of of how that he was
[1:17:47] anointed king and how God how God spared
[1:17:50] him and uh many of times before and
[1:17:52] about how God had how God had done many
[1:17:55] of works in his life and and now he was
[1:17:58] going through now he was now he was
[1:18:00] going through the trial of his life but
[1:18:02] yet he could hold that sword in his and
[1:18:04] and he could remember God's promises and
[1:18:07] he could remember the faithfulness of
[1:18:09] God. You know, and I begin to think
[1:18:11] about HOW THAT THERE'S A LOT of things a
[1:18:14] lot of a lot of us, we sit here and we
[1:18:16] go through things in our lives and in
[1:18:18] the midst of the in the midst of the
[1:18:20] chaos and in the midst of the trial that
[1:18:22] we're going through, we're asking the
[1:18:24] question why and why this and why that
[1:18:27] and Satan likes to bring up a lot of
[1:18:28] things. Well, it's because you did this
[1:18:30] and oh, you remember you did that and
[1:18:33] you swed this seed and oh, you swed that
[1:18:36] seed. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SOMETIMES
[1:18:38] YOU GOT TO SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO JUST BE
[1:18:40] ABLE TO GET THERE AND hold the sword of
[1:18:42] God and you got to be able to stand
[1:18:43] there and say, "Yes, I did that, but I
[1:18:46] put it under the blood." AND AND GOD,
[1:18:48] YES, HE'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THE accuser
[1:18:50] of the brethren, he's he's sitting THERE
[1:18:52] AND HE'S PUTTING ALL MY SINS ON ME AT MY
[1:18:54] nighttime hour. I stand there and I GO
[1:18:57] BEFORE GOD AND I TRY TO PRAY AND HE PUTS
[1:18:59] this in front of me AND HE PUTS THAT IN
[1:19:01] FRONT OF ME. YOU JUST REMEMBER THE TIME
[1:19:04] AND LET GOD BE ABLE TO PUT IN THE TIME
[1:19:06] OF A remembrance of all the victories
[1:19:08] that you shared with the Lord and at the
[1:19:10] TIME WHEN GOD HAD BROUGHT YOU OUT OF
[1:19:12] YOUR OF YOUR DISTRESS ABOUT HOW GOD HAD
[1:19:15] BROUGHT YOU YOUR FAMILY when you thought
[1:19:17] that it WAS IMPOSSIBLE ABOUT HOW THAT
[1:19:19] THE TIME THAT GOD PUT GAS IN YOUR TANK
[1:19:22] WHEN IT WASN'T ABLE WHEN GOD PRO
[1:19:24] PROVIDED TO PAY THE BILLS that you're
[1:19:27] not standing here because of any merit
[1:19:29] that you MIGHT HAVE THAT OH I'M SO GOOD
[1:19:31] GOD HAS TO ACCEPT ME. YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:19:34] AS IT FILTHY rags is before God. BUT
[1:19:37] IT'S THE FACT THAT GOD ELECTED YOU. GOD
[1:19:39] CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:19:42] WORLD. AMEN. THAT YOU MIGHT MANIFEST AND
[1:19:44] DISPLAY HIS ATTRIBUTES. THAT'S WHAT
[1:19:47] YOU'RE TO REMEMBER. You're not to
[1:19:48] remember the former things that you was.
[1:19:51] I'm not to remember the wretched man
[1:19:53] that I thought I was. I thought I was
[1:19:55] some great individual thinking that I
[1:19:57] oh, you know, everybody needs to respect
[1:20:00] me, needs to know who I AM. BUT GOD
[1:20:02] WANTS YOU TO REMEMBER, AMEN, THAT I AM
[1:20:05] THE ONE THAT BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE
[1:20:06] WILDERNESS AND I AM THE ONE, AMEN,
[1:20:09] THAT'S GOING TO KEEP YOU ON THE OTHER
[1:20:10] SIDE. JUST REMEMBER WHAT I'VE DONE FOR
[1:20:13] YOU.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; You know, thinking about this,
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. thinking about this and I'm
[1:20:21] wrapping it up here, but the children of
[1:20:23] the children of Israel had come and they
[1:20:26] had come to a place over the at the
[1:20:28] River Jordan. Now, they come to this
[1:20:30] place here and Jordan was all swelled up
[1:20:33] and the river was wide.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It's interesting that God would bring
[1:20:37] them there in the middle of the flood.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; But yet, God was the one that created
[1:20:43] the seasons. God was the one that was
[1:20:46] that causes everything to flow. Causes
[1:20:48] everything to come back. But he brought
[1:20:50] them to a river Jordan
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; flow just overflowing. Oh, muddy old
[1:20:54] Jordan. Amen. But he come up to the
[1:20:56] banks and he said, "You know what? I I
[1:20:58] need you to take the music and put it
[1:21:01] first."
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; As our brother Kobe was talking about
[1:21:05] praise,
[1:21:06] he wants you to take the music. I want
[1:21:09] you to take the ark and I want you to
[1:21:11] put them first. And what happened? the
[1:21:14] waters separated
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; AND AFTER PRAISE HAD WENT through
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; after THE WORD OF GOD HAD WENT THROUGH
[1:21:22] FIRST AND THE PEOPLE HAD COME ACROSS HE
[1:21:24] SAID NOW I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING IN
[1:21:27] remembrance
[1:21:29] he says I WANT YOU TO EVERYONE A TRIBE
[1:21:31] OF YOUR A STONE FROM EVERY ONE OF YOUR
[1:21:34] TRIBES AND I WANT YOU TO SET IT RIGHT
[1:21:36] HERE SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR
[1:21:39] CHILDREN'S CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN AND
[1:21:41] ALL THOSE THAT ARE AFTER AFTER THAT WILL
[1:21:42] REMEMBER THIS DAY.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THAT I PROVIDED FOR YOU. I
[1:21:47] PROVIDED FOR YOUR NEEDS. I WAS THE ONE
[1:21:49] THAT BROUGHT YOU THROUGH.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Not by your intellect or any
[1:21:53] ability that we have, but by God's grace
[1:21:55] and by his word, we're brought through.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. As our brother gets ready to come,
[1:22:02] God bless you here this evening.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep God in your remembrance.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:13] Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I will praise him.
[1:22:19] I will praise him.
[1:22:23] Praise
[1:22:25] the lamb for sinners slain.
[1:22:33] Give
[1:22:35] him gloryy
[1:22:37] all ye people
[1:22:43] for his blood has washed away
[1:22:50] sin stain. One more time. I
[1:22:55] will praise him.
[1:22:59] I
[1:23:01] will praise him.
[1:23:04] Praise
[1:23:07] the lamb for sinners
[1:23:11] slain.
[1:23:16] Give
[1:23:17] him glory
[1:23:20] all ye people
[1:23:27] for his blood has washed
[1:23:32] away
[1:23:34] each day.
[1:23:37] That was powerful tonight. Taking that
[1:23:40] sword of Goliath that was a memorial.
[1:23:44] That's the reason why they kept it there
[1:23:46] in in the tabernacle in the first place.
[1:23:49] That was a trophy of God's divine grace.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; And to think the very one who had cut
[1:23:57] his head off with that sword is the very
[1:24:00] one that was taking it in the in his
[1:24:03] time of need. Brother, that's powerful.
[1:24:06] That that was powerful tonight. He could
[1:24:07] have t I don't think he took up his full
[1:24:09] 15 20 minutes. Amen. And uh but that was
[1:24:13] good. Brother John, come on up. Let's
[1:24:14] sing that again. I will praise him.
[1:24:21] I
[1:24:23] will praise him.
[1:24:27] Praise
[1:24:29] the lamb for sin slain. God bless you,
[1:24:34] brother John. Amen.
[1:24:38] Give
[1:24:39] him glory.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; For his blood
[1:24:55] each
[1:24:57] day.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brothers and sisters.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; You want to talk about nervous?
[1:25:05] That was good. that I've enjoyed tonight
[1:25:07] so far. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Uh I do have a couple scriptures here.
[1:25:13] Uh let's start with uh John 11 and 40.
[1:25:19] This is where Jesus came up
[1:25:23] to I guess after the funeral of Lazarus
[1:25:25] and he he came up there. But he said,
[1:25:27] Jesus said unto her, said I not unto
[1:25:31] thee, that if thou wouldest believe,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; thou shouldest see the glory of God.
[1:25:38] Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; I like that. And then if we go over to
[1:25:42] Psalms, I think it is Psalms 46 and 10,
[1:25:47] he said, "Be still and know,
[1:25:52] believe, know,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; be still and know that I am God,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; and I will be exalted among the heathen.
[1:26:00] I will be exalted in the earth." Amen.
[1:26:04] May God add a blessing to his word.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:08] But but I like this because we know as
[1:26:11] the preachings that have been coming
[1:26:12] from the the the sermons lately and and
[1:26:15] even when you listen to other ones
[1:26:17] online and and brother Windle's been
[1:26:19] preaching, we're in a fight.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; We're in a battle.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says in Deuteronomy when
[1:26:26] he was talking to him there, he said,
[1:26:27] "When you go to battle," he didn't say
[1:26:30] if or nothing. He said, "When
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; when you go to battle and you show up in
[1:26:36] this battle, there's going to be more of
[1:26:39] them."
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a lot more of them
[1:26:41] than there are of you.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; They're going to be all around. And when
[1:26:46] you see this,
[1:26:48] don't worry.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; How can you not be afraid when you're
[1:26:58] facing
[1:27:03] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1:27:06] more than what you are.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; How can you have the peace to praise God
[1:27:15] in the middle of this when everything is
[1:27:19] coming at you left and right and you
[1:27:21] look at this great multitude because God
[1:27:26] said so.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Right. All right. All right. He said,
[1:27:29] "When you look at them, don't be
[1:27:31] afraid." And he said, "When." So, this
[1:27:33] isn't new. It's not new for me. It's not
[1:27:36] new for you. It's not new for your kids.
[1:27:38] It's not new for anybody that's a
[1:27:40] Christian. The battle's coming.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; And if you're not in one coming out of
[1:27:45] one, you're going into one.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; The battle is coming,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; but the battle ain't yours.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:27:54] Lord,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; because he went on down in those same
[1:27:57] scriptures and he says, "Don't worry.
[1:27:59] This is my fight. This is my battle. I'm
[1:28:02] going to go. I will protect you. I will
[1:28:04] hold you. I will do this."
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And then he turned around and said, "And
[1:28:08] then when you come up and you lay siege
[1:28:10] to the city and it's been a long time."
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; It's been a long time.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "Don't cut down the trees
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; because they're there for you to eat off
[1:28:24] of until."
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. See, now I like until because
[1:28:29] until means there's a will.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; The walls will fall.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; So, as we're standing in this battle and
[1:28:38] this fight's going and we're praising
[1:28:40] God, we're not lying.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; You understand? We're We're not lying.
[1:28:47] People look at us and they're like,
[1:28:48] "They're crazy." Do you know what just
[1:28:50] happened to that guy?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And yet he's singing and praising like
[1:28:53] nothing's wrong.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; But why not?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Until the walls fall.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; We can praise God, brother.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Until they will. It's a promise. It's
[1:29:06] given.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And but then in that scripture where it
[1:29:09] says the cutting of the trees in
[1:29:11] Deuteronomy, it says don't cut down the
[1:29:15] trees. You can use them to eat.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Now, cut down the bad trees, but don't
[1:29:22] you cut down those good trees.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes, sir.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:29:27] But how do you know it's a good tree?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Even an apple tree in the winter time
[1:29:32] looks dead.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; You may be at the worst time of your
[1:29:38] life. It may look like you're on your
[1:29:41] last leg. It's over.
[1:29:44] And before you say anything, age doesn't
[1:29:46] matter because I'm going to tell you
[1:29:48] right now, when it comes to God, math
[1:29:50] don't matter.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; You can go to school your entire life
[1:29:56] and you read the Bible and you'll
[1:29:58] understand that math is not true.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; It's not. You take 300 people up against
[1:30:07] thousands and thousands, there is no way
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; they're going to win.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; But they do,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; right? Yes.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; You take David against Goliath, 5 foot
[1:30:18] nothing to 9 foot something. There's no
[1:30:20] way.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; He's going to win.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; But he did.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Because it never was his fight.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible said to be still,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; be still and know that I'm God. Now,
[1:30:33] being still in this particular thing
[1:30:36] doesn't mean you're not stepping with
[1:30:38] God.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Right? You're still moving with God.
[1:30:43] You're still praising God. You're still
[1:30:44] loving God. You're still asking for
[1:30:46] forgiveness when you make mistakes cuz
[1:30:48] you're going to make mistakes.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; You fall down, you're going to get up
[1:30:54] that
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; you're still moving. So be still. Be
[1:30:57] still of what? Cut down the bad trees.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; The thoughts that come at your head, the
[1:31:04] things that come at your heart.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Okay.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; All the negative stuff, cast it out.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Get rid of it.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. For God speaks the truth and all
[1:31:15] man's word is lies.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what the doctor
[1:31:19] says. Doesn't matter what anybody else
[1:31:21] says. It doesn't even matter what
[1:31:23] somebody says when they come up to you
[1:31:25] and said, "Well, I asked my doctor about
[1:31:27] you." Shut it down.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; You don't need to hear that because
[1:31:31] faith comes by hearing the word. So make
[1:31:33] sure you're hearing the right word
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; because faith is going to come from what
[1:31:38] you listen to. So if you listen to the
[1:31:40] bad, you're going to believe the bad.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; But if you listen to God,
[1:31:45] be still. Let it go. God said
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; God said,
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord."
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; God said,
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; You can praise him. You can love him.
[1:31:58] Arrows are flying. Everything's coming
[1:32:00] at you. But it don't matter
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; because greater
[1:32:07] that's in you than in the world.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Greater or we could say more.
[1:32:15] You see, when you step out into that
[1:32:17] battle, brothers and sisters, and you're
[1:32:18] looking at Satan and he's got every
[1:32:20] demon in hell aiming straight at you,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; if you're a Christian,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; because if he doesn't have them aimed at
[1:32:26] you, you're doing something wrong.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Because if he's not worried about you,
[1:32:32] you have a problem.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; All right. So, when things are going
[1:32:36] bad, don't be quite so upset because it
[1:32:40] may maybe just a little bit mean you're
[1:32:43] doing something right.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Because the math don't matter. Right?
[1:32:49] Come on.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; But the biggest thing if if if I can
[1:32:54] leave anything with you guys tonight
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; when you step out the door of your house
[1:33:02] and you've put on your armor and you
[1:33:04] know part of that armor is putting on
[1:33:06] the shoes for the preparation or
[1:33:08] something of like that to go preach the
[1:33:10] gospel of peace.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; you're putting on an armor to go into
[1:33:14] battle, but you're putting on shoes to
[1:33:15] go tell everybody it's peace time.
[1:33:17] Remember that as part of your armor,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; but when you're facing him and you walk
[1:33:24] out there and Satan's looking at you and
[1:33:27] calm your mind
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; because the mistake was Satan's
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; All right. Come on.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. the mistake of coming against
[1:33:41] you and giving you a disease or telling
[1:33:44] you you have this or telling you you've
[1:33:46] done wrong or telling you you've done
[1:33:48] bad was Satan's mistake.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Because God protects his word
[1:33:56] and you are the manifestation of his
[1:33:59] word.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will have a people in this
[1:34:03] generation that loves me. I will have a
[1:34:06] people in this generation that follows
[1:34:08] my word. I will have you are the word.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And God will protect that word. So when
[1:34:18] Satan has come against you,
[1:34:21] what did the prophet tell God? Open his
[1:34:24] eyes so that he can see. And he turned
[1:34:26] around and looked and as far as he could
[1:34:27] see, there was chariots of fire,
[1:34:30] cherubs, angels all around surrounding
[1:34:32] the whole entire army. Satan's mistake
[1:34:35] was coming against you because he
[1:34:39] brought every demon in hell into the
[1:34:42] middle of the camp of God. He brought
[1:34:45] every demon in hell into the middle of
[1:34:48] the one that has already whooped him
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; before this whole thing started. He
[1:34:54] cannot touch you. He cannot have you.
[1:34:57] All you have to do is be still here and
[1:35:01] believe God and you'll see the glory of
[1:35:04] God.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Because brothers and sisters, we are the
[1:35:08] word.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; We're standing on the word, right?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and the word
[1:35:20] was with God and the word was God. So
[1:35:22] even if you're just standing on the
[1:35:23] word, you're standing on the shoulders
[1:35:25] of Christ.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; All right. Right.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; It ain't even you walking. It's him.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; So, we want to praise him.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; And we do.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man that God doesn't
[1:35:42] impute sin to. Brothers and sisters,
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; blessed is the man. So, when you get up
[1:35:48] in the morning,
[1:35:52] I want you to put on your armor and I
[1:35:54] want to put on your shoes. getting ready
[1:35:56] to go out and preach this gospel of
[1:35:58] priest the the peace the ministry
[1:36:00] brother that you were talking about and
[1:36:01] you get up and go down through there and
[1:36:03] you lace up your boots and you walk up
[1:36:04] to that door and you say Lord I'm ready
[1:36:08] and then shut your mind down
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; all right
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; look out to whatever it is you're facing
[1:36:17] and go
[1:36:19] are you ready for this not to yourself
[1:36:23] but to Satan
[1:36:25] cuz he has no arrows.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; He has an empty quiver.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; He don't even have the keys to his own
[1:36:33] house.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Why do you think he's trying to get in
[1:36:36] yours?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; He has no place to live. He has nowhere
[1:36:41] to go.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; He's got all of these demons following
[1:36:45] him and he has nowhere to take them.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Nowhere to set them down, nowhere to
[1:36:50] feed them unless you let him. That's
[1:36:53] right.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; So, don't let him.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; The mistake isn't yours, per se,
[1:37:02] brothers and sisters. It's Satan's
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; forever thinking
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; He could have a child of God.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. because we can praise him and we
[1:37:13] can love him and we can go to our
[1:37:15] brothers and sisters in peace knowing
[1:37:18] that if maybe just maybe they do or we
[1:37:20] do or something that it can be forgiven
[1:37:22] because if God doesn't impute sin to us,
[1:37:24] we don't impute sin to others.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; God forgives us, we can forgive anybody.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; If God can forgive me in my past, he can
[1:37:34] forgive anybody.
[1:37:36] So we can take all of that and know
[1:37:40] without a shadow of a doubt
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; we are going home
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; because as Paul said I am persuaded
[1:37:50] brother that nothing nothing nothing
[1:37:55] can take me away from the love of God.
[1:37:58] He's done proven it to me too many
[1:38:00] times. Way too many times. So you can
[1:38:04] have peace in whatever you're going
[1:38:05] through, whatever's coming at you,
[1:38:07] whatever cravings that hit, whatever
[1:38:09] mental things that come at you, you can
[1:38:11] have peace and you can praise God and
[1:38:14] you can fight this fight by simply
[1:38:17] standing there
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; because it's his fight. He'll fight it.
[1:38:22] You just have to show up.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; But you got to show up.
[1:38:32] If you fall down, get up.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Ask for forgiveness. Put it under the
[1:38:37] blood. Put on your armor. Lace up your
[1:38:40] boots. Walk out the door. Here am I,
[1:38:42] Lord. And if you get knocked down, get
[1:38:45] back up. Put on your armor. Lace up your
[1:38:48] boots.
[1:38:50] Walk up to the door. Here am I, Lord.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; And when you get knocked down, get back
[1:38:56] up and do it all over again. Because
[1:38:59] come Thursday morning, you're going to
[1:39:01] walk out that door and you're going to
[1:39:03] win.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; You're going to manifest what God has
[1:39:07] already done.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; He already saw you as a conqueror. He
[1:39:12] already saw you as the overcomer. He has
[1:39:14] already saw you. And he will give you
[1:39:16] nothing that you cannot handle.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; He will put nothing on you that he has
[1:39:22] not already seen you overcome. He has
[1:39:25] seen it and he's God. He said, "I'm God
[1:39:28] and I change not." So if he saw you
[1:39:31] defeat Satan before the foundation of
[1:39:33] the world, he has not changed his mind
[1:39:35] now.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; You have still defeated Satan. All we're
[1:39:40] doing is having the patience and the
[1:39:43] peace and the praising of God to see the
[1:39:46] manifestation of it.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; And I cannot fight your battle.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; I cannot win your battle.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:57] But I can promise you with everything
[1:39:59] that's in me, I will fight with you.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; I will get on my knees and pray with you
[1:40:03] if that's what you need.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't
[1:40:08] be afraid to say, "Hey, I need a little
[1:40:10] bit of a a push. Can you can you help me
[1:40:13] out?"
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's not a very sane man that
[1:40:18] don't request help when he needs it.
[1:40:20] And God said, "I am
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; that I am."
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I was that I was." He
[1:40:30] said, "I am." And he is the help.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; In a time of trouble,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; it may come from me. It may come from
[1:40:41] Brother Kobe. It may come from Brother
[1:40:43] Wendell.
[1:40:45] But the help is still there. But I can
[1:40:48] tell you this from experience.
[1:40:52] If you will believe God, you'll see the
[1:40:55] glory of God.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Whether you ask for the help or not.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; But you have to believe.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; You have to believe. We are a body.
[1:41:13] If we pray together, God will fight
[1:41:16] every single battle this church has.
[1:41:20] Every single one of them. God don't step
[1:41:24] back and say, "No, not today."
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; That ain't the God we serve.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; The God we serve said, "It's my battle.
[1:41:32] You don't have to fight this. I've got
[1:41:34] this."
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; So, if you have those things coming into
[1:41:39] your mind and saying, "I ain't worthy.
[1:41:42] I've done too much.
[1:41:45] Don't listen to it.
[1:41:48] Forgive yourself.
[1:41:50] God forgave you. Forgive yourself.
[1:41:54] Forgive those that you think or may have
[1:41:56] or think or may have come against you
[1:41:59] because in all of it is forgiveness
[1:42:03] because forgiveness and love go hand in
[1:42:06] hand. But until you can give it to
[1:42:09] someone else, you must give it to
[1:42:12] yourself. Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; But have peace in the battle, brothers
[1:42:16] and sisters,
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; because the battle ain't yours and you
[1:42:19] ain't fighting it and it's already done.
[1:42:22] Be still
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; and believe.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:42:32] There is power
[1:42:36] in the name of Jesus.
[1:42:41] There is power
[1:42:45] in the name of Jesus.
[1:42:50] There is power
[1:42:54] in the name of Jesus
[1:42:59] to break every chain. Break every chain.
[1:43:04] Break every chain.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] Amen. And I'm so thankful for God's
[1:43:19] divine presence. And we are in a we're
[1:43:22] we're in a war. We're in a we're in a
[1:43:25] war for life. But brother, we've already
[1:43:27] won.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Let the worshippers arise.
[1:43:36] Let the sun
[1:43:39] sing.

[1:43:45] my all. Can I get you boys to bring this
[1:43:48] chair down here? I'm surrender to the
[1:43:53] king.
[1:43:55] Let the worshippers arise.
[1:43:59] Sing it with all of your heart now.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[1:44:08] I'm surrendering
[1:44:11] my all.
[1:44:15] I surrender to the king.

[1:44:24] Amen. He's going to close the service
[1:44:26] with with his part. And so, uh, we want

[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And
[1:45:20] we appreciate this opportunity.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. had if you would put up on the
[1:45:27] screen 1 Corinthians 2 and nine.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go right in to the
[1:45:37] message.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; But as it is written, I have not seen
[1:45:41] nor heard, neither have entered into the
[1:45:44] heart of man the things which God hath
[1:45:47] prepared for them that love him. Going
[1:45:51] to the next verse. But God hath revealed
[1:45:53] them unto us by his spirit. For the
[1:45:57] spirit searchth all things, yay, the
[1:45:59] deep things of God. For what man knoweth
[1:46:02] the things of a man, save the spirit of
[1:46:05] man which is in him? Even so the things
[1:46:08] of God, knoweth no man, but the spirit
[1:46:11] of God.
[1:46:12] Now we have received not the spirit of
[1:46:15] the world, but the spirit which is of
[1:46:17] God, that we might know the things that
[1:46:19] are freely given to us of God, which
[1:46:23] things we do speak, not in the words
[1:46:26] which man's wisdom teacheth, but which
[1:46:29] the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing
[1:46:32] spiritual things with spiritual.
[1:46:36] But the natural man receiveth not the
[1:46:38] things of the spir spirit of God, for
[1:46:41] they are foolishness unto him,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; neither can he know them, because they
[1:46:47] are spirit spiritually discerned.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; But he that is spiritual judgeth all
[1:46:54] things, yet he himself is judged of no
[1:46:58] man.
[1:46:59] For who has known the mind of the Lord,
[1:47:02] that he may instruct him. But we have
[1:47:05] the mind of Christ.
[1:47:08] Now let's go to f Ephesians 1 and start
[1:47:13] at the 8th verse.
[1:47:17] When he hath abounded toward us in all
[1:47:20] wisdom and prudence,
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. having made known unto
[1:47:24] us the mystery of his will, according to
[1:47:28] the good pleasure which he hath purposed
[1:47:30] in himself,
[1:47:32] that in the dispensation
[1:47:35] of the fullness of times, he might
[1:47:38] gather together in one all things in
[1:47:41] Christ, both which are in heaven, which
[1:47:44] are on the earth, even in him. Now go to
[1:47:47] the 15th verse.
[1:47:49] Let me let me go and read that. Read
[1:47:51] that one. Go back to
[1:47:54] go back to the level. And then we have
[1:47:58] obtained an inheritance being
[1:48:00] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:48:02] of him who workketh all things after the
[1:48:06] council of his own will. Now go to the
[1:48:09] 15th verse. Wherefore I also after I
[1:48:12] heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
[1:48:15] and love unto all the saints cease not
[1:48:18] to make mention of you in my prayers
[1:48:24] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:27] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:48:29] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:48:33] the knowledge of him.
[1:48:35] The eyes of your understanding.
[1:48:38] Notice that. The eyes of your
[1:48:41] understanding.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; It's not the eyes of man.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; But it's the eyes of your understanding.
[1:48:48] being enlightened, being given
[1:48:50] revelation that you may know what is the
[1:48:53] hope of his calling and what the riches
[1:48:56] of the glory of his inheritance in the
[1:48:59] saints
[1:49:01] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:49:04] his power toward us who believe
[1:49:07] according to the working of his mighty
[1:49:09] power which he wrought in Christ when he
[1:49:13] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:49:15] his own right hand in the heavenly
[1:49:18] places far above all principality and
[1:49:21] power and might and dominion.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Every every name that's named.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Not not only this world but also that
[1:49:38] which is to come.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. To come. And I put on all things
[1:49:43] under his feet and gave him to be the
[1:49:45] head over all things to the church.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Which is his body, the fullness of him
[1:49:52] that fillth all and all.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Name
[1:49:59] which is named every name which is
[1:50:02] named.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Kind of broke me up there. Think about
[1:50:08] Parkinson's.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:10] He's about that name is given power to
[1:50:14] the church over all things.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; But I've been thanking for some time and
[1:50:21] I actually preached this message back in
[1:50:24] Pac
[1:50:27] and
[1:50:31] we're living
[1:50:33] in the fulfillment of this scripture.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. in Ephesians 1 and 10 where it
[1:50:39] says that in the dispensation of the
[1:50:41] fullness of times.
[1:50:43] Well, you know that Paul also wrote
[1:50:46] concerning
[1:50:47] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:50:49] times in Romans the 11th chapter.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. when it's talking about when the
[1:50:57] dispensation of the fullst times talking
[1:51:00] about the gentile
[1:51:02] when it comes to the close.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we're living in this
[1:51:09] dispensation.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; We see also according to Luke 17:30 the
[1:51:16] 29th verse actually starts where it said
[1:51:20] as it was in the days of Sodom and
[1:51:22] Gomorrah so shall it be in the day when
[1:51:24] the son of man is revealed.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:30] The scripture said that eyes not seen
[1:51:32] nor ear heard neither hath entered into
[1:51:34] the heart of man the things that God has
[1:51:38] prepared for those that love him.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Man today
[1:51:48] has put God out of their consciousness.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; They put God out of their memory.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; And the scripture said in John 1
[1:52:00] or I believe Acts 33
[1:52:02] that
[1:52:05] Christ
[1:52:07] in him was light.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; And the light was in the world, but the
[1:52:14] world recognized him not.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Now, that's funny.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Because if it's light, surely you can
[1:52:22] see light.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; But they were blinded.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Right. And so man of their knowledge
[1:52:31] and their intellect has forsaken Christ
[1:52:34] the found of living waters.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; If he not themselves sisters that can
[1:52:40] hold no water.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; But Paul said and if
[1:52:47] in 1 Corinthians 2
[1:52:50] he he said that God hath revealed them
[1:52:53] unto us by his spirit.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. For the spirit searchth all
[1:52:58] things,
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; brother,
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; yay. The deep things of God.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; So the the world today
[1:53:08] because they've rejected Christ,
[1:53:11] they've left
[1:53:14] their own imag imaginations.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; And walking after their own thoughts.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:22] But we've cast down imaginations.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; We've cast them down.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Because we've seen light.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; We've seen
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; the glory of God.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:53] I'm going to close it pretty quick. I
[1:53:56] want you to turn
[1:53:59] to
[1:54:00] Isaiah 40.
[1:54:11] Full of Isaiah 40.
[1:54:24] about the 30th verse. I believe it did.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Go back up to verse 28.
[1:54:46] Has thou
[1:54:48] not known? Has thou not heard
[1:54:52] that they everlasting? God, the Lord,
[1:54:56] the creator of the ends of the earth,
[1:54:58] faintth not. He is weary.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; There is no searching of his
[1:55:04] understanding.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; He hath given power to faint,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; to them that have no might. increases
[1:55:13] strength.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Even the youth shall faint, be weary,
[1:55:18] and the young men shall utterly fail.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; But they that wait upon the Lord
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; They shall mount up with the wings as
[1:55:28] eagles. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:55:31] They shall walk and not faint.
[1:55:35] Okay, summing all this up,
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; I have not seen nor heard, neither have
[1:55:42] it into the heart of man the things that
[1:55:44] God hath prepared for those that love
[1:55:47] him.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Just think
[1:55:50] we're walking in the light of this hour,
[1:55:54] this day.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; It's because God has prepared it for us.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; That makes you a special people. Yes.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; You're not just anyone.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:11] But Paul
[1:56:14] in in visions what 10th verse
[1:56:19] in this section of full times he
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; he shall together.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; In one all things even in Christ
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; both which are in heaven which are in
[1:56:33] earth.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Every name written in the lamb's book of
[1:56:36] life in heaven. He's gathered together.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. here on the earth.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; leave that in the eagle for just a
[1:56:48] minute.
[1:56:51] Years ago, we first first time we were
[1:56:54] in Arizona,
[1:56:55] I was under a burden
[1:56:58] and I just I really wanted to get to the
[1:57:01] people and I wanted them to catch the
[1:57:04] revelation and what God was doing in our
[1:57:07] day. Yeah.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And I was under his burden. I went out
[1:57:11] to the place where I this little place
[1:57:16] where I enjoyed going to pray up in
[1:57:19] further up in the mountains and it come
[1:57:21] a snowstorm
[1:57:23] and the sun broke through and it's real
[1:57:27] pristine, beautiful, white. I got out of
[1:57:31] my truck and the first thing I seen
[1:57:34] about 15 feet above me out of the way.
[1:57:38] First on a tree branch were three eagles
[1:57:46] and I was fascinated with them eagles.
[1:57:49] They didn't fly away. They sat there to
[1:57:52] watch me. I was watching them and it
[1:57:55] come to me that they represented the
[1:57:58] first, second, and third pool.
[1:58:03] And I as I was thinking about that, I
[1:58:07] seen five caught movement way up above
[1:58:11] in in the sky. I turned around and
[1:58:14] looked and there was another eagle. And
[1:58:18] the eagle had his wings spread. He was
[1:58:21] just going around in circles. He was not
[1:58:24] beating the wind. He was not fighting to
[1:58:27] gain altitude. He was not fighting to
[1:58:29] stay there. But he had caught him a
[1:58:32] draft, an upper draft. Just spread them
[1:58:35] wings up.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; He's circling around
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; right that draft.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; And he's just going higher and higher
[1:58:46] and higher until finally it was just a
[1:58:49] speck. Then it was no more.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Out of sight.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; I cried. I thought,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, you brought us through these three
[1:59:01] pools.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; First, second, and third pool. It's
[1:59:05] rapturing time.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; the church according to Ephesians.
[1:59:18] We're in his body, the fullness of him
[1:59:21] which filth all in all.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the church.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; We're not walking our own power, our own
[1:59:31] might, but we're walking in his.
[1:59:34] And when we just got to wait spread out,
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; and rest
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; not struggling,
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; not fighting,
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; not worrying,
[1:59:50] but just simply resting.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; And then the spirit carries higher and
[1:59:58] higher and higher.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:00:01] We're far above all the things in this
[2:00:04] world.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; I thought about brother Brandon 1956
[2:00:11] starting in 56, 57, 58, 59.
[2:00:16] He was warning America. You received a
[2:00:19] visitation. I predict you'll flatly turn
[2:00:22] it down.
[2:00:24] He went on to say in 58 57 we know that
[2:00:29] the wheels are turning. We can see in
[2:00:31] the newspaper everywhere we look wheels
[2:00:34] are turning.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; 59 he warned us.
[2:00:39] Then in 60 61
[2:00:43] 62
[2:00:44] 62 he preached the indictment.
[2:00:49] Then in 63
[2:00:53] he broke the seals.
[2:00:58] It was at that point that everybody
[2:01:01] pulled back from him because they
[2:01:04] couldn't understand the mystery of the
[2:01:06] seals.
[2:01:08] But God had prepared them for us.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:21] He's renewed our strength.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; The ministry of the seventh angels.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Would you turn the hearts
[2:01:41] of the children back to the fathers?
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:48] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; He renewed our strength.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Has eagles.
[2:02:00] There's that eagle.
[2:02:05] Brother said the seal and said there was
[2:02:09] four beasts. There was the lion. There
[2:02:11] was
[2:02:13] there was a
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; the ox there was the beast with the head
[2:02:25] of man.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Then there was the eagle.
[2:02:28] He said the first three beast were
[2:02:33] earthly bound.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; But the eagle was heavenly
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; bound.
[2:02:42] So
[2:02:44] the
[2:02:46] first three
[2:02:48] feast
[2:02:50] they had to endure.
[2:02:52] They had to go through
[2:02:55] crimson
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; church.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; They had to go through all that they
[2:03:01] went through.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; But the eagle
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; wouldn't earthly bound.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He soared above
[2:03:12] all of the
[2:03:14] confusion,
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; above all the false knock false teach
[2:03:21] and restored us back. Renewed our
[2:03:24] strength.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Lay the weight upon the Lord. She
[2:03:29] renewed their strength.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; I was in Pentecost.
[2:03:35] I was born 1950
[2:03:38] and it was the golden time.
[2:03:43] Pentecost
[2:03:45] had the great moves, the great revivals,
[2:03:51] but they
[2:03:54] the young Pentecostal church ran
[2:04:00] fast, ran hard.
[2:04:03] They just knew that that was it.
[2:04:07] But they ran out of strength.
[2:04:10] They ran out of energy. But they the
[2:04:13] wait upon the Lord. I
[2:04:17] I can remember my own testimony in my
[2:04:21] own life that there was something more.
[2:04:26] There'd be something I sent my wife
[2:04:29] stood my wife at the corner of fourth in
[2:04:31] Lev take me to the place in Claremore. I
[2:04:36] come out of church. I stood out there
[2:04:37] with her. I said there's got to be more
[2:04:39] than this.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; There's got to be more than blown
[2:04:42] sandwiches.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; I said there's got to be some steak.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; There's got to be somebody singing her
[2:04:47] teeth.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I said, "I'm I'm determined to
[2:04:50] search and search and search search
[2:04:53] these scriptures till I I can find what
[2:04:55] I'm looking for." Said in there
[2:04:57] somewhere and I got stuck in Ephesians
[2:05:01] and I just studied forward and backward
[2:05:03] in Ephesians and Ephesians and
[2:05:06] Ephesians. And then I preached out
[2:05:08] Ephesians visions. Every time I preach
[2:05:10] visions and people think you're wearing
[2:05:13] the ground, no, I'm looking for
[2:05:15] something. There's something in visions.
[2:05:18] It was the book of redemption. Found
[2:05:20] out.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And so
[2:05:26] I was one of the many eagles
[2:05:29] that just waited. I just waited. Just
[2:05:31] waiting that come in contact with the
[2:05:34] message of brother Bradom.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; And it took me a while to get settled in
[2:05:41] because of my Pentecostal upbringing.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I had so much to sh to shed
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; to get rid of. But
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; wow.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; I was just kind of I kind
[2:05:59] like that eagle that was molting.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; He go up into the the cave high in the
[2:06:07] mountain.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; There'd be three things. had be sharp
[2:06:11] jagged rocks that come out of the the
[2:06:13] walls of the cave. There had to be
[2:06:15] honey. There had to be water dripping
[2:06:18] from the ceiling. And that vehicle he
[2:06:20] would take he would beat his wings
[2:06:23] against the sharpjacking rocks and beat
[2:06:27] out all them old feathers. Then he would
[2:06:30] take and
[2:06:32] rub his beak
[2:06:36] against that against that wall
[2:06:40] down to a nub.
[2:06:42] Then
[2:06:44] because he couldn't eat, he could only
[2:06:47] suck. He sucked that honey. This took
[2:06:50] place 40 days. When he come out, Amen.
[2:06:54] He may have been 100 years old, but his
[2:06:56] strength had been renewed as as a young
[2:07:00] one. Can you say amen?
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I felt like that that
[2:07:06] was my testimony is I just would steal
[2:07:09] away and
[2:07:13] my my 10 k folk didn't understand me.
[2:07:17] They
[2:07:19] brother and I real close.
[2:07:23] We married married si sisters. We had a
[2:07:27] double wedding.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; We're just close.
[2:07:31] But he couldn't understand where I was
[2:07:32] going.
[2:07:34] He could understand what I was doing.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; I didn't understand.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; So I couldn't expect him to.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; But I I plied ahead.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; It caused a great breach between us.
[2:07:55] But I I loved him.
[2:07:58] But I just I just couldn't stop
[2:08:04] you was waiting on the Lord.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; That eagle
[2:08:12] went to be in the center of cry 193.
[2:08:18] We'd come through the first pool, the
[2:08:20] second pool. Everybody went through
[2:08:22] that. Everybody loved brother Brandham
[2:08:25] because of the gifts that was in his
[2:08:27] life. Oh, when the third P started, they
[2:08:32] all pulled back.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; But I had not seen nor you heard,
[2:08:38] neither have entered the heart of man,
[2:08:40] the things that God has prepared for
[2:08:42] those that love him.
[2:08:47] We caught the revelation.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; In 69,
[2:08:55] we put man on the moon.
[2:08:58] And the first thing that Neil Armstrong
[2:09:01] said when he touched down
[2:09:05] in that lunar landing
[2:09:09] vehicle,
[2:09:11] he said,
[2:09:12] "The eagle hath landed."
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "The moon taps at
[2:09:19] the church reflecting the glory of the
[2:09:22] sun."
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:27] He said, "Deal have landed."
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Well, it kind of reminded me
[2:09:34] of the cowboy philosopher Will Rogers.
[2:09:40] I seen a little clip where he is getting
[2:09:44] prepared to go overseas.
[2:09:47] They asked him a series of questions and
[2:09:50] asked him, "Are you an American?"
[2:09:53] He t
[2:09:55] back lean on the counter and said,
[2:10:00] "Well,
[2:10:02] I reckon
[2:10:04] my people were here to greet the pillars
[2:10:06] when
[2:10:17] So
[2:10:22] they were
[2:10:25] rejoicing that they landed on the moon.
[2:10:28] Well, spiritually speaking, we we were
[2:10:31] there to greet him.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; That's not seen nor you heard. Neither
[2:10:40] had there to the heart of man the things
[2:10:42] that God prepared for those that love
[2:10:44] him. Amen.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; I cease not to make me much of you in my
[2:10:50] prayers that God will give unto you the
[2:10:52] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
[2:10:55] knowledge of Jesus Christ
[2:10:58] that you may know
[2:11:02] the riches of his inheritance in the
[2:11:05] saints
[2:11:06] the exceeded greatness of his power to
[2:11:10] us.
[2:11:12] Aren't you glad for that? Amen.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; So, here we are.
[2:11:17] We're
[2:11:19] living in legal time.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; In the time
[2:11:25] when we need to spread wings out
[2:11:28] and just soar
[2:11:30] and soar and soar,
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; not downward, but high
[2:11:36] up. For God has sent in his spirit
[2:11:40] of revelation.
[2:11:42] things higher
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; and higher
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; and higher.
[2:11:47] It s of course
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; I hope that I was able to convey my
[2:11:56] thought.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to rise
[2:12:04] rise rise above it all. I'm going to
[2:12:09] rise.
[2:12:11] Rise.
[2:12:14] I'm going to spread my wings, fly away
[2:12:18] to heaven. I'm going
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, sing it now.
[2:12:25] Are Are you going to rise above it all?
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Rise above it all.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Spread your wings, little eagle.
[2:12:42] My wings
[2:12:48] of it all. I'm going to rise.

[2:13:30] rise above it all. Going to spread my
[2:13:35] wings and fly away to heaven.

[2:15:11] and the honor.

[2:15:20] as I magnify your name. You deserve the
[2:15:26] glory. Hallelujah.
[2:15:29] And the honor. Yes, my Lord.
[2:15:34] Lord, we lift our hands worship as we
[2:15:39] magnify.

[2:17:02] you.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:17:09] I love
[2:17:11] you.
[2:17:15] You're the only
[2:17:20] one
[2:17:21] true love
[2:17:24] of
[2:17:26] my soul.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; I love you. I love you. I love you.
[2:17:41] Yeah.
[2:17:43] Yes.
[2:17:46] Yes. Yes.
[2:17:49] You're the only
[2:17:53] one
[2:17:55] through.
[2:18:03] If you've not loving him the way that
[2:18:06] you used to love him.
[2:18:10] If your heart is not just bleeding to be
[2:18:15] with him,
[2:18:19] why don't we just renew our love to him
[2:18:21] here tonight?
[2:18:24] Because truly, he's been so good to us.
[2:18:28] The sermons that were brought here
[2:18:31] tonight, Brother Kobe, praising him. No
[2:18:34] matter what you're in,
[2:18:38] you've got to praise him.
[2:18:41] Brother Harry saying, "Make sure that
[2:18:43] there's no alts or anything that will
[2:18:46] hinder anything between you and your
[2:18:49] brother, you and God."
[2:18:56] Brother Miguel
[2:18:58] coming in taking the sward of the enemy.
[2:19:06] No matter what Satan has brought, you
[2:19:08] can go back to the
[2:19:11] no matter where you are right now. Maybe
[2:19:16] the devil's trying to
[2:19:18] hide the purpose from you, but you can
[2:19:20] go back, grab the sword of that enemy
[2:19:23] that you cut the head off with.
[2:19:28] Brother John preaching math don't
[2:19:31] matter.
[2:19:33] That's not always accurate.
[2:19:38] you and God as a majority.
[2:19:42] Dad
[2:19:44] ending it here tonight
[2:19:47] being renewed like the Eagles.
[2:19:51] We are an eagle generation.
[2:19:55] I say tonight, Lord, I love you.
[2:20:00] After a service like this, it should do
[2:20:03] something to our hearts. I I love you
[2:20:06] and I want to love you more.
[2:20:08] I want to walk with you in humility. I
[2:20:11] want to I want to give of myself to you.
[2:20:15] As we sing this song,
[2:20:18] why don't you make it a
[2:20:22] a desperate cry of the soul? I love you.
[2:20:26] Sometimes things can get a little
[2:20:32] common.
[2:20:34] That commonality between you and God can
[2:20:36] just we get used to coming to church. We
[2:20:39] get used to just
[2:20:42] but let's not get used let's not make
[2:20:44] God religion. Let's not
[2:20:47] may it be a reality.
[2:20:50] Lord, I love you.
[2:20:54] the first church age, he says, "I've got
[2:20:56] one thing against you. You've left that
[2:20:57] first love.
[2:21:02] This last church age, Christ is totally
[2:21:04] out of the church."
[2:21:08] And the only common, the only place that
[2:21:11] you're going to find love is in the
[2:21:12] bride.
[2:21:15] So, oh God, don't ever let love leave
[2:21:18] me. Don't let love leave me.
[2:21:24] That's why we got to be hid in him. We
[2:21:26] got to stay in him. Stay in that that
[2:21:29] secret place with him. That third pool
[2:21:32] is to keep the life, preserve the life.
[2:21:37] Cuz we ain't going to get it out there.
[2:21:39] We're not going to find the kind of
[2:21:40] love. I don't care people being we the
[2:21:44] only love we're going to find. The
[2:21:45] genuine love is going to be in you.
[2:21:51] guard that sacred fire. You've got that
[2:21:54] third pool. You and you alone are in
[2:21:57] that secret place with God.
[2:22:00] You and you alone.
[2:22:05] Brother Brandham said it was an absolute
[2:22:06] secret. There was no way to even
[2:22:09] understand how it worked. They came in
[2:22:10] crippled. They walked out a hole. They
[2:22:12] came in and they walked out. It's that
[2:22:16] secret place.
[2:22:18] It's preserved just for you, my friend.
[2:22:22] It's built for you. It was given for
[2:22:24] you. It's for no one else.
[2:22:28] The presidents won't have it. Religion
[2:22:30] won't have it. Denominations won't have
[2:22:31] it. That secret place with God, that
[2:22:35] third pull ministry, that you and God
[2:22:38] alone
[2:22:40] in the confines of his living word,
[2:22:44] that's the greatest gift that we could
[2:22:46] ever have.
[2:22:48] Don't let anything take that away from
[2:22:50] you. Love him. Love this message.
[2:22:56] Let's all sing it to him now with a real
[2:22:59] genuine heart.
[2:23:01] Yes,
[2:23:03] I love
[2:23:05] you.
[2:23:10] Yes.
[2:23:12] Oh, yes. I love you. I love you.
[2:23:17] You're
[2:23:19] the only
[2:23:22] one
[2:23:23] true lover.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[2:23:34] Yes,
[2:23:35] I love
[2:23:38] you.
[2:23:42] Yes,
[2:23:44] I love
[2:23:46] you.
[2:23:50] You're
[2:23:51] the only
[2:23:53] one
[2:23:55] true lover
[2:23:58] of
[2:24:00] my soul.
[2:24:06] Bless the Lord.
[2:24:09] I bless your name. I love you.
[2:24:14] Thank you for the
[2:24:17] word of the Lord tonight, Lord.
[2:24:21] Thank you for the message of the hour.
[2:24:24] Thank you for opening our eyes to see
[2:24:26] you.
[2:24:29] For there is a people that you have
[2:24:31] revealed them to.
[2:24:34] Oh God, we thank you.
[2:24:37] We thank you.
[2:24:43] Thank you, Lord, for not leaving us here
[2:24:46] in this desert, dry land of Leotaa.
[2:24:53] But you've come, you've you've come
[2:24:57] to let us know that you're alive and
[2:25:00] you've made us alive through your
[2:25:02] presence.
[2:25:04] Thank you, Lord.
[2:25:07] Thank you, Jesus,
[2:25:09] with all of my heart. Lord,

[2:25:31] looking,
[2:25:33] hiding, and providing for us.

[2:25:50] Thank you Jesus.
[2:25:54] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:25:59] You're
[2:26:01] the only
[2:26:03] one

[2:26:08] of my soul.

[2:31:07] everyone if you're
[2:31:10] leaving children to their homes,
[2:31:14] be with them in their school, on their
[2:31:16] jobs.
[2:31:18] The ladies taking care of their
[2:31:21] families.
[2:31:24] I ask Lord that your peace would
[2:31:26] surround them.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Let us be a witness of your grace Lord
[2:31:32] to one another as brother Harry was
[2:31:34] saying.
[2:31:37] A witness of your grace to one another.
[2:31:39] Witness of your grace to those outside
[2:31:42] where we were.
[2:31:46] Let us not blaspheme your word.
[2:31:52] Let us not live the life of a hypocrite.
[2:31:58] Let the people see Jesus in us. Lord,
[2:32:03] that's our desire.
[2:32:06] We thank you for it. Father,
