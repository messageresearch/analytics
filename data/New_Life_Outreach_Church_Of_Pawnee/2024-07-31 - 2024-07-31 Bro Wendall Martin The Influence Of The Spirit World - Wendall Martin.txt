the book of Hebrews the 12th chapter the 23rd verse it says to the general assembly or we can go to the 22nd verse but year come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels amen God bless you you can have your seats here tonight amen and um we are are wanting to um speak a little bit this evening on the spirit realm we live in a we live in a body amen um but we are we are dealing with the um the spirit real brother brother brandham would tell us he says now just below the Mortal beings amen lay the the the realm of demon power right and just above that is the is is the uh uh The Souls of the unjust and then below it is the very domain of Satan itself amen hell and he then he says and then just above us is the holy spirit then under the alter lays The Souls of of the just men and then next is God himself he says one is going downward and one is going upward and he says the two Spirits are here on Earth influencing the people of this Earth and so amen so we've got amen these these two Spirits amen you've got angels that that are that are coming from above that are influencing on the earth and then you've got the uh Spirits amen demon powers that are coming from hell that are influencing the people here of Earth and and so amen and and and brother Brenham would tell us he says now amen that there are the seven dimensions you've got the matter time volume I believe it is of this Mortal being and then you've got the fourth dimension which is the picture waves or amen the sound waves and then you've got the fifth uh uh uh uh Reed Dimension and it's the region of the lost and then the sixth is the paradise or the the Saints the first Heaven amen and then you've got God himself and so amen uh uh he would he would talk brother brandom his ministry was was dealing with Spirits he he amen he could see Angels he could see demons he could see amen uh uh he he seen all of these things as a prophet and he could come back and let us know amen that Earth right here in these in this Mortal uh uh uh space time and and volume here these invisible Spirits are influencing us and and trying toing bring amen Havoc or bring healing can you say amen and and so we we've got to understand that those you're you're not just you know many times we entertain Devils because we don't uhu we don't realize we think that we're just you know having a bad day or that we're just uh uh you know you know someone's mad at us and we've got hurt feelings toward them or amen uh someone's done something wrong or or maybe you've made a mistake now you're feeling bad over it but I just want to tell you those are demons they're demon powers that come against the word of the Lord and and against the sons of God and trying to bring you under now we have been talking amen uh about you know Angels these these um the last couple times I've I've dealt with amen the angel of God is still with us amen and the angels are there uh uh uh uh W with with the word of God Amen and and the authority of sons and amen that the angels of God are there with your words and I and I and I just wanted to go and deal with it a little bit more amen because these Spirits these demon spirits will do anything that he can he'll tell you that you've send away your uh your your day of Grace He he'll tell you that amen you fallen and you'll never get back up and that you'll never you'll never amount to anything Amen brother brandom there in in uh in in the prayer line he would say how do you do sir he says there's some something strange about you sir Satan is desired to take your life you're all tore up you think you've send away your day of Grace you think your life is ruined do you love Jesus what makes you love him before there could be anything to to there uh before there could be anything to there make you love him there has to be a Creator to create the love in your heart that's right you've sin if you've send your day of Grace away you would hate Jesus but you love him and you're all right the devil's just lying to you you're nervous he says come here and I'll cast him away for you if you'll believe do you believe it he says bow your heads uh he says keep your heads bow everyone till you hear me say raise up this is demonology now this man is going amen he's going through the struggles the enemy's telling him you've send your day of Grace away something has happened amen uh in his life that that that would make him I I'm sure he he he he just had a major blunder and and the devil is there fighting against him but he says this is demonology he says almighty God be merciful to the boy he stands here and Satan is trying to get him in this condition to commit suicide but Thou Art here to relieve the boy and to make this evil spirit go and thou has said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils and they'll uh and then upon the authority of God's word as a Believer I now ask the spirit that's on the boy of unbelief to leave him go out in the name of Jesus Christ and bother him no more I set him free and may the enemy be bound and leave this room and torment no one else in Jesus name he says now you're all right you can raise your head you feel all right now son is that right Devils you would have committed suicide in a few days that was on your mind he thought he had send his day of Grace away and when he come up a real BL black heavy like a fog meeting me in the face that's devils and the boy is free now feel happy and go home rejoicing thank God for his goodness to you God bless you can you say amen amen so so we can see that that things you you think man I'm not good enough you think well I'm amen the the Lord doesn't love me you think that you know God's not going to God's not going to uh uhh keep me God's not you know I I'm not loved right those are demons and you've got to understand those are demons and those demons amen I how many knows that there's that there's been h a plenty of folks in the message that have committed suicide in the past is because they have allowed demons to talk to them and if there is anyone in the church that should know amen how to how to cast out a devil it should be the believer we should come on Church you don't entertain those Devils amen one of the one of the uh uh uh you know famous uh uh you know times when brother Brandon was was was there you know brother Ed Bisal talks about the time where the where the uh uh where brother brandom's you know in the prayer line and he's fixing to go out and and he uh there're up in in in Canada you know on the Alaskan Highway and he and then he he he hollers out Soldier Boy you will not commit suicide or something of that he says he says what's the matter soldier boy you're not going to commit suicide the devil is lying to you boy you've only got a phobia he's lying to you he'll drive you insane if you believe him deny him renounce the devil I command you in Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce that devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer and you go back and be a gentleman a real real man hallelujah hallelujah amen now now what was he fight now we we find out later on what his problem was he was fighting a devil of homosexuality amen it was a devil that was that was trying to torment that boy and yet he was a Son of God he was a Son of God but see those Devils amen and I I I I was uh amen as as we were listening to brother Jonathan how many enjoyed those messages on Sunday and as I was listening to brother Jonathan something struck me amen that the anointing of the Holy Spirit was here so supernaturally Sunday and those messages were incredible amen as brother Jonathan uh he says I I I am going to take it upon myself to believe for d healing I'm going to take it on myself Satan you've pushed us too far and we're not going to accept it anymore amen when we when we we we've got to we've got to understand that that we are to cast out Devils we are not to pamper Devils we are to cast them out amen we're not yeah well can you say amen Amen brother Brandon would talk about amen the he he he he would say you know talking about you what kept you from getting saved in the first place he said there was a spirit that was hanging over you to keep your predestinated soul from being saved your soul was ordained of God Amen but you amen but he and he would say this he would say the only thing that kept me from being safe when I was 12 years old because a spirit that hung over me a devil saying wait a a a little while longer that's the reason you wasn't Sav when you become of age of accountability a spirit you got in a crowd that hovered over you and that that kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got his that's got his right mind but what he wants to do right but there is something won't let you do right is that right that's the devil somebody say that's the devil amen any kind of a demon that's a devil It's all under It's all under the network of Satan amen and all of the angels are all amen Heaven's angels are all under the network of the Holy Ghost the angel of God can you say amen amen he says hallelujah Christ paid your healing and your salvation now here it is you get ready he's commissioned his church to cast them Devils out there you are in my name they'll cast out Devils you ain't going to heal nobody you're going to cast The Devil away from them so that they can accept the healing I've already done that's right preacher stood on the platform and preached the message and preached the gospel and devil scattered that that that man come to the altar under conviction and say I want to get saved he never saved the man he cast out the devil that's right and the man got saved he come and accepted his salvation I I want to tell you tonight the preaching of this message will cast The Devil away that's why we believe in going to church that's why we believe in amen being faithful is because those that Hallelujah this message will cast The Devil away from you and your life amen we entertain Devils way too much we entertain the power of sin way too much amen but I want to tell you amen the glory of God is here in this that listen if there is a devil how many believes there's Devils sir then I want to tell you there's Angels if there's Devils there's also angels that are sent there amen he says now he says he says the the same thing by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning you believe that and have been born again are Sons and Daughters of God Christ has already healed you the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a Spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's already done it well praise the Lord I I I I I I want to tell you right now great greater is he that is in you than he that is in that world there is a spirit what is keeping us from from from reaching out there is a there's a Darkness amen that tries to overshadow our mind overshadow ourselves to where we cannot reach up and accept it but I I I've got some good news for you amen the gospel of Christ is the power of God under salvation and salvation comes Body Soul and Spirit amen that's what it does he says now that's my commission that's what God gave me that's what he gives he give every gospel preacher who will believe the power and authority to break that spirit I believe with all of my heart that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already broken he says I do I believe there is amen there is every sick person in here now feels a lot better if that's right raise up your hand who you who are sick amen see there what's the matter the devil has broke away from you he has to Faith Comes by hearing and hearing of the word oh my there's no Voodoo involved here it's the word of faith and the angels of God there to drive it away can you say amen amen did you realize that every time a preacher is up here preaching under the anointing of the holy spirit that that when we say anointing of the Holy Spirit we are saying the angel of God is here to fulfill his word in your life Amen brother Bram says El easier when he had the when he had the assurance that the angel was going before him then he could decide to go because he had something to back him up I think that ought to be the Assurance of every man of God that preaches the gospel that he's got something positive from God that'll back up what he preaches I'm not preaching my own Doctrine I'm not preaching my own ability I'm not preaching my own ideas I'm preaching the Eternal Word of God and if you can believe what God is said the angel of God is here to back it up to your heart amen oh the darkness has to go away when the light comes in darkness has to go back when the light comes in amen all fear has to lead when the light comes in when the Gospel of Jesus Christ what is the gospel it's not the word only it's the Holy Ghost backing that word up amen he says my the Apostle Paul says my my preaching came not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but I come in the power and the demonstration of the spirit amen what is we what is he saying this word is not just a man's word a denominational word but this word is the Living Word of God and the living power of the living Christ is there to back it up Hallelujah well glory to God hallelujah amen I'm not looking at I'm not looking at this as just a mind battle I'm here to tell you it's a demon that is tormenting your mind you didn't wake up in a bad mood amen you're not having a bad hair day these are demons that come against you can you say amen amen now he says he says got something positive that when he preaches if you haven't got it Brethren it's for you God still sends his men with an angel before him when he goes to take the message to the church on down he says every true servant of God that sent out has got a whole book full of divine promises that he can offer to the bride and I'm so glad of that he's got gifts in there for and he will not hold any of them back he will give every one of them out freely a true servant of God a model servant a servant that God can put trust in he won't try to hide it back from her because he knows that she is the upcoming Queen can I hear a hallelujah hallelujah amen entertaining entertaining Spirits amen nurturing Devils sitting there amen and thinking you know when when when I when I when the flu's coming on or or when you got cough and and then you sat there and start entertaining that kind of thing well I'm probably going to get this or I'm I'm probably going to why would you do that when you know it's a devil come on now amen you got a lump on your breast amen and the devil's getting you all fearful I remember I remember some years back uh uh fresa you know got got a lump on her on her and it was more than just a lump on her breast amen it was oozing and and and it was and and and and if it it we we were we were a little bit nervous amen but we got together and we started praying and we called out to God and did you know amen God came on the scene and totally amen closed that up healed that up and she went back or she went to the doctor to have it checked out amen and there was no cancer no nothing there why because we understood it was a devil and we don't have to accept what the devil is putting on me it's a spirit and I have to accept that and when I know that God has commissioned every believer not the preacher every believer to cast The Devil away then why don't you boys and girls cast them away why don't you mam and daddies cast them away why don't we break the strongholds of the enemy that's over our minds telling us that we can't be anything but I want to tell you you can hallelujah amen now I I the these Spirits now Jesus would say that those spirits that come amen he would he would say there in Matthew he would deal with it you know there in Matthew the 12th chapter then the 45th uh 43rd through the 45th verse he would talk about when the unclean Spirit comes out of a man that he can be he he can be delivered amen but if a man is not careful and does not fill his soul with the presence of God with the word of God Satan will come right back around knock on that door and you'll open that door up and he'll bring seven times more Devils that's right amen he says when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walks in dry places he Congress and finds none then he said I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he has come he finds it empty swept and garnished and then he then go with he and taketh with him himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also of this wicked generation can you say amen amen Jesus came to the Jesus came to to to the crippled man there in John the the 5th chapter and the 14th verse amen and and the the the the the the the impotent man that that lay there at the gate be at the at the pul of patha and and he amen the Bible says that he had been crippled for 38 years so it was not a a a disease that was going to take his life this was a debilitating H uh something that you know either crippled him or he had py or amen but it wasn't anything that was going but but here now I want you to watch because when Jesus healed him amen and he went on then the then the Bible says that Jesus goes back to look for that boy for that man and and that 20 that that 14th verse he says and afterward Jesus finds him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come upon you amen what what he's what he's saying is unbelieve no more don't disbel believe the word of God or you'll go back and be worse than what you ever were these are devils they want to take over they want to take control they want to be can you say amen amen that's right Spirits brother Brandon could could could feel the spirits he could see the spirits am man he talked

what he does in one service it takes me four amen but but with these angels that God sends the spirits there are spirits there that that that are listen you you are a fallen being and the reason why Spirits are having control today is because sons of God have been out of their position amen what what made Jesus the that the scripture says man amen was was was supposed to be over the Angels Hallelujah but we find that that they're below the Angels but what happened to Christ Christ came and a mortal being to die Amen to take sin to go to hell but now the scripture says that he is lifted above the angels and he has come to bring many sons into glory amen in other words we are now seated with Christ in Heavenly places we can take the word of God but believe the word of God and the angels are sent to minister for you as sons of Goden hallelujah amen what what did that uh the the the uh sister CA there in in uh uh Hebrews 1 and the last very last two verses amen uh there in in

not just a dead religion these real devils and there's real angels there's a real God who has authority over every unclean Spirit can you say Amen brother Brandon would say now look between you and I stands a dark object it's a cloud like a cloud floating it's moving I know who it is I know what he does to the people you're bothered with a nervous condition isn't that right it's a mental nervousness upset you think sometimes you're going to lose your mind another place he says between you and I is a dark cloud floating like a breath many people's told you get near to yourself get next to yourself I believe it was forget about it you can't do it because there's something at you all the time haunting you is that the truth if by God's grace and God's power and the divine presence of Jesus Christ if it'll leave you now will you permit it to come back again now now he's he's asking the question amen we can we can take this thing off you but are you going to allow are y'all hearing me it's not a good thought versus a bad thought these are demons somebody say they're demons amen and those demons will come in can you say amen amen go another one he says you you want to get over that nervousness look sis I want you ask you something that's just just a minute if I could any if I could do anything for you that's the most horrible thing there is of anything else you have no Assurance of yourself it gives you all kinds of funny feelings you have all kinds of upset feeling like you was going to lose your mind and everything and it bothers you really bad sometimes you get you you it gets real bad and you get Melancholy and have to go off and sit down when you're walking in the streets I see you then it gets on you there and sometimes you just have to go back home because it is bothering you so bad brother brandham says it's the spirit of nervousness that comes upon the believer do do do do you really do you really realize that that devil wants to make you feel like you know that that that you're not good enough that devil that's constantly telling you you're not worthy that that's a devil that is telling you that you don't well you're you're just you you you you're you're just subpar you'll never be like anybody else that ain't your mind that's the devil influencing your mind that's something telling you that you can't and that you won't that's a demon brother bradam says it's demonology and that demon will come in there amen and he'll work through families he'll work through he'll he'll work through uh uh churches he'll work he'll go through jobs he'll do whatever he can that these demons have got to have a body right amen letting off pressure he said there's a there is pressure on the people today and this pressure has no limitation any denominational lines it has it has no age line has no respective person it's on The Young and the old good and bad on everybody pressure we're living in a neurotic age neurotic tension amen goes on says all all this together this this tension building up then the results is doing something wrong acting out of place that's right that it it it'll make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way it'll make the good act that way because it's tension steam built up got to blow it out somewhere if you don't you'll blow the boiler up amen these are devils that are there well praise the Lord and they want to influence they want to influence us amen but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world come on angels are there amen now remember what did we just read amen Hebrews 1 and 14 he says are they not all ministering Spirits talking about angels sent forth to minister for how are they ministering for they're coming at your disposal you're a Son of God you've got the word you can't you derive from God just as my boys have got the genetics of wendle Martin and durren Martin and Wesley Martin and all the way back to can trace their amen lineage all the way back a hundred years down or back 200 years however long amen so can a son and daughter of God Trace their Li all the way back to the mind of God Amen God ain't got Lo like a like like a man he's he's a spirit man but you come from the mind of God therefore you've got to G up the loins of your mind there is where the devil's going to fight you can you say Amen now amen they're there now it's important as I have been as I've been hidden in in the amen when we when we talked about the angel of God is still going before us and then the that other one on Amen uh uh the authority of sons amen and and I brought in on both of them confession you've got to you've got to conf

Serpent's children can't believe the make believer can't believe only a Son of God can believe like God believes and it's the devil telling you that you can't it's the devil telling you that you'll never be that I just want to tell you he's a liar he is a someone say it with me Satan you are a liar Hallelujah you are a liar you're trying to keep me from my healing he's battling your mind he's battling your spirit he's telling you that you can't he's telling you that you're too old he's telling you that you're too young he's telling you these things Satan you are a liar amen come on now brother Brenham says now here the Bible comes right back around and tells us here that God sends forth Angels Glory what are they ministering Spirits Glory ministering spirits and where from the presence of God what to do Minister his word amen you're not to minister some Theology of some denominational group but to minister his word amen that's it ministering spirits and forth how do we know they are the Bible says the word of the Lord comes to the prophets is that right these angels Minister his word through his spirit and Minister the word through the Holy Spirit and the spirit and the word comes to the prophets and the prophets had the word of God that's the reason why they could do Miracles that they did it wasn't the man it's the spirit of God in the man the spirit of Christ in the man for the word of God what had he done he's cleaned out every channel God had chose him he was anointed with the Holy Ghost it wasn't him he never did anything till he saw a vision Elijah sat on

stay right with the word and it will cut every somebody say every devil amen so he's saying God sends the Prophet The Prophet brings the word with a Vindication amen and you can stand there in assurance knowing that God will back that word up if you put that in your mouth Hallelujah he says stay with that word it'll cut what is it the ministering Spirits sent forth from the presence of God

dealt with uh uh uh there in the authority of sons amen and we talked about how that there're in Hebrews 10 that the the 10th chapter that he is the high priest of your confession amen he's the high priest over the house of God he's the high priest of your conf and then he says there in in Hebrews 10 and 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering why because we've already heard it straight from God we believe it's true and we've got Angels working on our behalf can you say Amen ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for The Heirs of Salvation amen I'm a mortal man

here when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel it was here when Martin Luther the that young priest thrown the communion on the floor and said it's kosher and the just shall live by faith it was here then but we're just now finding it and it's also so that it's in our presence tonight is God and the angels and supernatural beings that's unseen to the Natural sense of sight and someday it'll be a reality just as television is now and just as common what he's saying is there's coming a time where people are going to believe the angels of God are here to enact his word yes sir can you say amen amen there in in in Psalms 34 and 7 the angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear Him and deliver them amen what is that encampeth it means places round about a circuit amen round about it

what it is they don't know how good we feel amen that that uh how good we we feel to know that we were once Sinners and ulated from God without hope without Mercy without God in a world of corruption dying and going to a devil's hell and God stooped down and picked us up and redeemed us and now we're above the Angels right now someone shout hallelujah he took he stooped down picked us up and
