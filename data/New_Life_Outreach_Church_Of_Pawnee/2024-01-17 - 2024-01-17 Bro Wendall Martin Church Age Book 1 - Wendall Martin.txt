yes wind go down and I see a ro before Paul left at Ephesus he said there appear Grievous wolves the serpent found a way to break the sun's influence he preached his doctrines of Lies so down and down the gospel went he showed a little light in smna and many saw him at pergam but there was less light in th TY but Luther saw him in Sardis Ag and it was 1750 a man by the name John Wesley he caught a little sunlight in Philadelphia and many Saw M Lea but up the breaking of a brand new dawn the sun came clothing in a cloud with one foot on sea and one on land the fullness of the sun was in the son of man thanks for Revelation 107 that man called William Bron he took the mystery of this risen son to every Kindred and Nation amazing gra out s the sound they were lost and they were found he gave the blind the eyes to see and they were thankful for the rising of the sun shom it's now the bright age to his elect it's the brightest day we see light in this evening time our Pathway to Glory we

sure glad to be here on a Wednesday night good good to be in the house of the Lord amen let's let's look here in the Book of Revelations the first chapter and um we uh have started here uh on the uh we're going to going to maybe if we can just start teaching a little bit out of the church age book and um I I um tonight I I I just I I want to wet your whistle and U to sort of get you uh to thinking a little bit of and and um um the the church age book is just so incredible and it's so important for us to read how many's how many's got church age books amen I think we passed out Church age books here here uh a while back and so they would and some of you brought your church age books this is good and I'd encourage you to start bringing your church age books and and um instead of reading quotes and things off of my iPad um I'm going to start reading them out of out of the church age book and it's and I'm not just necessarily going to uh just just just read Page by page I want you to do that at home but I I I'm wanting to um um I want us to really start digging into some of these truths and and um and maybe start preaching out of some of these areas and so but for right now let's let's look here in the Book of Revelations the first chapter and um and the um the 20th verse amen it says the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in thy right hand and the golden candlesticks the Seven Stars or the the seven or are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches why don't we just uh stop there and let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your love thank you for your many blessings that you have given us Lord we appreciate the songs of Zion we appreciate Lord the specials that were sung tonight and I I love you Lord with all of my heart I'm thankful as Sister Amy was singing that song the the history she gave the history of the church in that little song what what powerful meaning and and Lord we we we thank you for this great Revelation that you've given us I'm asking that you would open this Revelation up to us Lord Lord from the youngest to the oldest Lord from the least to the greatest and not just hear it with with our natural ears but Lord help us to really catch the revelation of what you are help us tonight father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening so the church uh age book is is really is is very important the um amen it it gives this this church age book gives you the history of the church and and so when we look there in the book of uh Revelations the 2 and third chapters it deals with the seven churches amen so and these are these are seven uh uh John was commissioned to write this book of Revelations and then he was told to send them amen send a copy uh to each of the Seven Cities there were churches in those cities and they he was supposed he was commissioned to send these letters uh uh to the the seven the seven churches in these Seven Cities now not necessarily that these um cities were that these letters were to the cities but it was it was these cities had characteristics amen uh that described the spirit and the condition of of each one of the ages each one of the seven uh cities were had had special had had had specific conditions had specific histories that God would use when our Prophet came when the seventh messenger came amen and when the Lord would reveal to him uh these Church ages uh the you he would go back and and look into these specific cities and and we would find the condition of the Cities The Same Spirit was in these Church ages and so amen um uh brother Brenham would go into history so each one of these now this is made up of of you're if you were look um how many brought your church age book with you tonight amen so so U sister Kala don't you put uh the the the Candlestick up there and um and so at the very front of your of your church age book you will see now this this isn't going to look exactly like yours but it's a little bit easier uh to read uh and and so it you've got your you've got your Seven Ages now you're going to have brother brandham starts the book out with the with the revelation of Jesus Christ then the second chapter is the patmas vision and then he goes into the Ephesian Church age and so then he'll go through Ephesus samna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia leosia and then the resume of the ages and and that consummates it so um there's there's this thing has got this this has got everything that we believe I mean we're talking about predestination we're talking about um the serpent seed um uh eternal security uh I mean everything it it this is to me to me outside of the Bible this is the greatest book that has ever been written this is an incredible book um it's got history it's got it all in it and so I would encourage uh every one of you to to really really get get into this and and study it now I would say that it is you you can't read it really like a book because um uh it's not like you're sitting down and and reading a story I mean uh youve you've got to study this you brother BR you can you can spend weeks on one page literally you can spend weeks on one page as as you go through scripture because everything that we believe and everything that brother brandham taught us now remember this the the seven Church ages it was uh uh after after brother brandham had uh had taught the church ages and and and he had given this by inspiration the angel of the Lord told him how to how to draw that and and and then at the end when he was through writing it y y'all remember what happened at or at the end of the um of the services amen the the angel of the Lord came on the back wall and and and made every one of those exactly like brother brandom made it he just came in and started changing the uh changing the the white and the black and this that and the other done all seven of them right there people were figting the whole church seeing what what the angel of the Lord was doing so he was backing up the angel of the Lord was backing up what brother brandham had taught now now brother brandham couldn't make that stuff up he couldn't put a light back there and make that and make that all happen God came to vindicate what his Prophet taught and that's the reason I say Amen we want to get into this book here and and and dive into it for ourselves and that goes for you children too M if you want to uh even bring in some you know uh uh uh read a page or two for for school and and uh teach him in in those areas there I think it's a wonderful thing um so so brother Bram would he would give amen he he would he would give the characteristics of the church ages amen each age uh he has a messenger Jesus when every one of these uh messages that are given to the churches he he addressed it straight to the messenger of the age amen and then he gives him the message and then anoints him to preach it to that church age now uh then under the inspiration of God brother brandom also gave the dates and so you will see uh the the the the dates like Ephesus started in in ad. 53 and went to 170 Samina went from 170 to 8312 and so you you can go on down there and of course our age started in 1906 and and so and each one of these uh churches uh God's given uh uh Commendation he's he's encouraging them and he's also getting on to them and tell them where they're failing and tell them what they need to do and and and and and all of these things here now but there is one thing that you're going to find in the in in the church is there in these Church ages is there's two spirits that that are at work God is wanting a Pentecostal church and Satan is doing everything he can to take away the power from that church amen that's what he wants to do and and so um and it's and it's God and Satan it just seems like amen and so this this book of Revelation and the and the inside of the Prophet it it exposes Satan for what he is and if you've got your church age book amen if you want to turn to the book uh uh 14 just real quickly and um uh I I'm as I say tonight I'm not I we're just going to to I I want to talk on God's goal I want to show you the goal of this church and um amen and what God's got in his mind so there in in in page 14 and and down at the third paragraph so uh you you've got your when I say the third paragraph amen I'm not dealing with the one that that was connected with the one above but it's but it's one two 2 three all right and so it says in this Revelation he tells what the end of uh of the devil is he tells how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him into uh the see might yah and cast him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than others than all others through liberal theologians and and pseudo scientists he is always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelations in both of these books we find Satan's origin and and his his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed in this in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is and Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy the confidence in the word now I want you to catch this because brother brandom is laying this out there in the revelation of Jesus Christ the Satan is doing this all throughout the church ages he says but when the church disbelieves Satan and believe leaves the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her now let me put in a word here for my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know that this gift in my life is Supernatural it is a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of the people when Satan knows he is going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it is that Satan has got a hold in their lives through sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows he is going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over the people's countenance Satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works that is why he hates meetings so these meetings so much when names are called and diseases revealed Satan hates it now what is this it's not the mind reading it is not telepathy nor is it witchcraft it is a revelation by the Holy Ghost and that is the only way I can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost but let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ uh is the same yes yesterday and today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot he knows that a whole lot more than 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 and action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is is false it has to be now remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he has cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true Revelation somebody say true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for then she can do the Greater Works she will be what inin an invincible Army if they get the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her yes now when Satan's telling you you can't be healed Satan's telling you you can't receive the Holy Ghost Satan telling you that you can't have the power of God that was only for the prophet or that was for another that is the Antichrist Spirit trying to seow amen seeds of of discouragement to you now watch he says he will be as thwarted definitely thwarted day as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us and we will prevail against them let's let's go down and read one more paragraph he says you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just an ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost and that means this book can't be Reeve be revealed to anyone one but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit and to hear and to know as I've already said let's see uh let's let's let's read one more here as I've already said this book Revelation is the consummation of of the Scriptures it is even placed exactly in in the right in the canning of scriptures at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you the authority over the devil and you can see why they who would ask or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word see in verse three a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book I think this refers to the Old Testament custom uh customs of the priest reading the word to encourage or to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them as long as it was the word the blessing was there it didn't matter whether it was read or heard can you say Amen now so we so we can see here that that God's desire amen the whole purpose for this this book of Revelation is to show the church at the end time now remember it was done in symbols because it wasn't going to be known to them it was not Rapture season for them right amen but the this group of people a prophetic class of people Amen in other words the Rapture could only come to a people who could understand the Mysteries now I'm not saying that it's just a a teaching per se that we're as brother brandham would say Amen it's not that you you you're reading everything and you're getting it all down intellectually but you're understanding that there are there are there are powers that are fighting against your rapture there are powers that are fighting against you coming into that that that perfect completion fighting you from going back to Eden Satan does not want us going back to Eden brother we're at the end we're at the end this church is coming to its completion now brother brother brandham has has given us a couple of time and I I've wrote this down I I don't I I don't know if y'all can see that or not but but brother Bram gave us he he he gave us uh he's going to use this in the in the church ages a lot uh there's going to be four different things that he's going to be bringing out uh uh quite uh and he's going to talk about the two Vines he's going to talk about the wheat plant he's going to talk about the bride tree and then he's going to talk about the grafted branches and so he's he's going to come in and and you're so we when when he when when you hear him talking you you you you you've got to understand that he is using scriptural terms he's using these things these Parables that that Jesus had brought in amen uh uh the two Vines is is it comes from the two SE where the where where where Jesus said the word and that's that's in Matthew 13 and 24 can y'all can y'all read these scriptures can y'all see that uh write those down because I I think it's I think it's good but Matthew 13 uh Jesus is saying that that the word has been sold and then the devil come in and and and and sold his seed and and then and and so then they he says well don't don't come in and and and try to pluck up the bad SE seed because when plucking up the bad stuff then you might end up pulling up the good stuff so he says let them grow together and as they grow together at Harvest time then you'll be able to tell which one's the good which one's the bad so so what what Jesus Is Telling amen and and we're going to find this out all through the CH the the church age book there are two Spirits God's got his seed now this is all happening in the church this is all taking place if if you read there in Matthew 13 this is all happening in the kingdom of God this is all taking place in the church this is not Sinner and Saint no this is the evil spirit of the Antichrist inside the church trying trying to do away with the power of the revelation of God's word y'all understanding that so so it's Satan and and and just remember remember that old devil that is that that fights you all the time and I again whether it be your healing whether it be your Perfection whether it be uh uh for your F that little gnawing demon that is constantly gnawing at your mind has been knowing at the church for all of these ages amen and and and the thing is we're going to find in the church ages that actually he he Satan won in in a lot of ways but then there but there is going to be a bride that is going to come forth so amen so in in this one here amen You So you you're going to see that that that there is two seeds amen here's the ground and there's two seeds planted and brother bram's going to deal with them as the two Vines and and they're going to grow together and they're going to be all connected together okay and they're going to be all in the framework of the church intertwined one's going to speak in tongues the other's going to speak in tongues the and it and it and it it it it looks the the religious brother Bram would talk about the this is all going to be in the church age book but he he talked about Abel and Cain how they were both worshippers so so you've got that now then you've got the wheat plant now we've been dealing with the wheat plant and we been going we we've been we've we we know that the the original Pentecost there there in in uh when it fell in ad uh 33 that original Pentecost was God's desire that's what God wanted amen that's the seed that's the original that's what God wanted to come and and we understand that as it came up to the age and as it and as it came into maturity then all of a sudden sudden amen it was it was it was hacked down and then it begin to come then it begin to come in into uh uh grow again and come in and we understand that we are in the very last of that of that season we've already went through this all right the bride tree brother brandham is going to deal with the bride tree and um how many's ever heard the uh brother brandham preach the restoration of the brid tree and he and he and he talks about how that uh that that in Psalms 1 and3 am man there was this great tree and and his fruit never withered and he was by the tree of life and and and then Satan come in and and there was the four insects brother Bram says they were the messengers of death so this great tree that was that that was that was here and it was a mighty tree and and and then Satan came in through through four messengers of death it was the pommer worm the ol worm the canker worm and or the yeah the caterpillar the Locust I I messed up on one of those but anyways they they started eating away the tree of the leaves and then went down to the uh uh uh to the bark and then went you know just just took it all the way down to a nub and and it and it and actually the whole tree just just just become nothing amen all it was was just a little was just a little a little part there brother brandom saids but then through the restoration and and this right around here in this Sardis age this is where this is where the restoration begin to take place and this is what we're dealing with tonight I'm going to read some out of the Sardis uh age here so you know I'm just going to put this right here this is the time that restoration begin to go through all of these others are these are some of the Dark Ages and and you're going through so then the then then the slowly but surely restoration begins to come up and then with the restoration we understand how how how that now there's a great bride tree now there's this this other amen how many's heard brother brandom talk about the grafted branches and and it's a and it's a church you know and and uh it it God's blessed them and well the enemy had came in and taken out the branches you cut down and cut down a lot of the uh uh uh these these branches here amen and started grafting his own branches in it okay y'all remember brother bandam teaching on that okay so he's going to use the grafted branches how that these branches are bearing false witness to the tree amen now am I am I confusing y'all on on any of this yet amen he's going to be dealing with this in the church ages and showing you so what I'm trying to show you is they're all pointing to the same thing the spirit of the Antichrist trying to defile God's Church y'all got that amen this is God's tree this is God's bride tree amen and then they put then they come in and and and grafted Methodist branches and Baptist branches and and all of and they're living off the life of the tree and and and bearing false witness of it see but but in the last day what did God say I will restore I will restore brother bradam says and when this when this tree if it ever puts forth another if it if it ever puts forth another Branch now here it is it's just been cut off and it's been and it's got all of this other stuff growing he says but if it ever puts forth another branch on its own he says it will be be a Pentecostal Branch it'll be the one that went to the ground at the beginning can you say Amen so what are we looking for now I'm not talking about I'm not talking about ausa Street Pentecost that has that that has nothing to do with what God is bringing but God's got one desire and that is to take us back to to to a people that he can live in like he had in the book of Acts amen now I want us to I I want us just to read a little bit more here as we as we go amen and and uh matters of fact let let's let's just look here let's look here at the patmas vision and um on page uh on on page 51 amen now uh I I I I forgot to try to I forgot to get my for those of you that have got the leatherbound books they're not going to be the same pages and so I'm going to have to uh um let's see let let me see if I can I don't know if I can okay so in the in the patmas vision it's going to be uh it's going to be under the golden lampstands but it's and it but it's going to be down to the um let's see from the that's going to be one two three four five it'll be at the sixth paragraph So if y'all wantan to follow me there with with those now brother brother Brandon would deal with this uh we're on 51 and in the middle we're going to start right in the middle of that of of that um uh paragraph there he's dealing with the lamps um well the first first one is lit and then it lights the others but I'm going to go right on down to where it starts with the original outpouring of Pentecost and on the page those of you that have this book right here there it is right in the middle of that of that paragraph right there all right it says the original outpouring and and I want you the reason I'm I want you to do this because I want you to Mark some of this down hey look see this is I'm I'm I'm a marker anyways so so anything that's good write it in the back of your book and then put the page number down on it and then because what you're going to find is brother Brandon's going to be dealing with like this like this part here on the on the Pentecostal on the Pentecostal Church brother Brandon's going to be dealing with it in every Church age and he's and he's because he's constantly going to be pointing what the end is going to be what the end is going to be what the end so what I do is I write down like I've got down here um uh the citrus tree okay with the with the grafted branches that's on page 51 I've got uh uh I've I've got the the the H the Holy Ghost ruling the church page 93 I've got all of these things all wrote down and and um and as you can see uh I I like marking my book up Hallelujah enjoy it while you're reading and and um all right let's go so the original outpouring of the Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on The Mercy Seat is doing is in doing his his Church through all the Seven Ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the never changing God in his Essence and in his ways in first in John 15 Jesus says I am the vine you are the branches he is the main Vine that which comes out of the original root from the original seed that has the life in it now the vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that do that now now watch this you can take a citrus tree such as an orange tree and graft it into the grapefruit limb a Lim a and graft into it a grapefruit limb a lemon limb a tangelo Limb and all and other kinds of that uh variety and all those limbs will grow but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges no sir the lemon the lemon limb will bear lemons the grapefruit limb will bear grapefruits and so on yet those limbs will be thriving off the life in the tree but if that tree ever puts forth another branch of itself it will be an orange branch and be oranges why because the life in the limb and the life in the trunk are identical whereas it wasn't so with the grafted lims so grafted branches have their sources in other kinds of L life from other trees from other roots from other seeds oh they will bear fruit all right but they won't bear oranges they cannot because they are not the original now now how many understands that amen you kid always understand that now why now have yall ever know have y'all ever wondered have y'all ever wondered why there are so many who claim to be Christians today and they don't look nothing it doesn't quite look anything like this huh it shows that the roots are from something else and it took a prophet to come in and show us these things that wait just a minute that's what these Church agents are going to show that that inside the church there's going to be all kinds of junk now it's not a church like this it's the church age it's the it's the it's it's it's the full scope amen within we're in the leodys and church age and so what we are seeing we've got our little church here that we love and yet we we we go down the road and we we you you kids have friends that go to church you have a lot of them cry and and a lot of them sing a lot of them a lot of them go to altars a lot of them do lots of wonderful things but yet their lives don't line up with the Bible praise the Lord it's because they they love God they've got some of the life of God now this they might be Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal they they truly they they live off of the life CA do you you have can you find that one that's got the different uh graft the tree that's got everything grafted onto it so you you can have a citrus tree you can have an orange tree and this is true y'all can look it up on the internet how that now but you you you put in a lemon you can Graft in a lemon Branch see now I don't know that that's a citrus tree and look at it it's got oranges lemons grapefruit um it's it's I think that tree there is supposed to have like uh four or five different kinds of fruit on it now it they're living off of the of the life of the root but yet they are bearing fruit of some contrary and that's the reason why we've got one Jesus and we've got all these denominations that are that are so different see they're they're they're religious and they're living off that life but if they've not had a new birth if they didn't come from Christ if they didn't have a new birth and born of Christ then all they are is like that bre branch that is that is simply stuck into the into Christ and they love to go into church they they pay their TI but yet they're they they they ain't going to they ain't going to quit cutting their hair they ain't going to quit smoking their cigarettes or they ain't going to quit oh they don't believe in in the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongue oh no we don't what but but the Bible says well we don't care what the Bible says you see they're just they're connected to it living the life of it but their fruits are totally different right are y'all are y'all catching that so but that's not what God had in mind he's not wanting a bunch of people to claim to be Christians he's wanting a church he can live his life through the Roots can't bear fruit the vine can't bear fruit only the branches and God has got a church that he wants to live his life through all right let's continue on now okay so now we're in the very last paragraph it says that's the way the church is the vine has been split and limbs have been grafted they have they they have grafted in Baptist limbs Methodist limbs Presbyterian limbs Pentecostal Limbs and those limbs are bearing Baptist Methodist Pentecostal Presbyterian fruit in other words they don't answer to the Bible they answer to their denomination that's right their denominations telling them what they can preach and what they can't preach their denomination well praise the Lord but God's got his church that's going to answer to him and his word alone amen well that should make you want to shout now he says and those Lambs bear Baptist uh Methodist Pentecostal Presbyterian fruit denominational seeds from which they produce the fruit but if the vine ever brings forth a another branch of itself you know which way this is going so you might as well shout hallelujah hallelujah that Branch will be exactly like the vine itself it will be the same kind of a branch that was brought forth at Pentecost it will speak in tongues and prophesy and have power and signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ in it why because it is thriving on the natural uh it is thrive on the natural resources of the vine itself you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the vine when those other branches were grafted in all they could do was Bear their own fruit for they were not born of that vine they don't know about the original life and the original Fruit they cannot know it for they're not born uh for they were not born of it but if they had been born of it that same life that was in the original stem Jesus would be would have come through them and manifested through them St John 14 and 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father denominations which are men a man directed cannot be born of God for it is it is the spirit not man that gives life oh how how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of the main bow because they had their Wicks dipped therein each Church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost his Wick and life has been immersed with in Christ and through that Wick he is drawing the very Life of Christ and by it gives out the light of the church what kind of a light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit right on down Through the Ages down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same light the same life same light is manifested by a life that has been that is hid with Christ in God now not only uh not only can we speak thus of The Messengers but every True Believer is dramatically depicted here they are all drawing from the same Source they all have been dipped into the same bow they are dead to themselves and their lives are HID with Christ in God they are sealed in by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and Shining giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in God fed by the Lord's word Satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for death has lost its sting the grave has lost its Victory thanks be unto God we have this victory in and through our Lord Jesus Christ and then he says amen and amen now this is what God is wanting us this is what God is looking to us to for can you say Amen now I want us to also look just real quickly let's go to the Ephesian Church Age and and Page 66 amen and I want us to just do a a some key things here now so brother Bram says if the vent when the maturity comes and and I'm and and again I'm coming back over here when it comes to this the the maturing time of this leodys and age now I've got this Pentecost down here in black and the bride time back here in Black that that that is not nine ages that is that is there's only Seven Ages right only Seven Ages so this bride time is in the leoan age but God brother bradam Ed this all those terms to let you know that they're in this age leoan age if you look there it's it's just completely blacked out but there is a bride that is going to come out of that in this bride time she's going to be very few but she's going to be full of the Holy Ghost and the Very life of God can you say Amen now now so I I want you to look that's the reason I'm hitting some of these areas there's these are some specific things that brother Bram says now remember Satan don't want you have that Revelation that the power of God is in this church he wants you to think that it's a dogmatic teaching and that you just got to learn to be good sit down and and go to church pay your ti make make sure the preacher eats a steak you know uh uh once or twice a month or two and and and and and make sure everything's all going good right now that's not what God wants God wants a church that he can live in flow through manifest himself to can you say Amen now now and he says when if that if that church ever when that tree ever puts forth another one it's going to be a Pentecostal Branch now let's look here and and look at another thing that brother brandham would say and that's in this in the third chapter the Ephesian Church Age and and it's going to be at the very uh right there on that first page of that chapter down to the um the third paragraph the key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messengers for each age is the mo is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible now this is good now he's going to he's he's he's going to he's he's going to show show some something to us the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes so as we go through this God never changes Church changes preachers can change God never changes your your ideas change God cannot change aren't you glad that God can't change amen now it says God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever Ecclesiastes 3:14 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever none can put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which uh that which hath been as now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is which is passed here it is an unchangeable god with unchangeable ways unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example for all other ages and God did it in the what God did in the first age is what he wants to do in all other ages now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first or original church was founded how God manifested himself in her the word can't change or be changed because the word is God John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God to change one word of it as as did Eve bring sin and death even as it says in Revelations 22 and 18 If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and the things that are written in this book thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the standard there is no other pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern God uh what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close though Scholars may tell you the apostolic AG is over don't you believe it such a statement is wrong on two accounts first of all Paul it is wrong to suppose that there aren't any more Apostles just because uh uh the the 12 original 12 are dead an apostle means a sent one and there are many sent ones today but they're called missionaries as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of Life there is an Apostolic age going on secondly they refer to an age of the manifested holy ghost power as being over since the Bible has been completed that is untrue there is not even one scripture that suggests that uh but many conclusively state otherwise here is our proof of of these charges that these charges are false Acts 2 and 38 then Peter said unto them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the promise of Power with the with which the apostles were ued at Pentecost is to you Jews to your children Jews and to all that are AAR off Gentiles to as many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and Gentile until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease now what are we to expect in this last church now where do expect a God in the Supernatural Rim but we're finding out that Satan knew Satan knows what God has in store so Satan has counterfeited it he's counterfeited it with the false Vine he's counterfeited it and he's trying to come in and be now he speaking in tongues he's working miracles and the True Vine wants to say ha stay away stay away I'm going to stay brother you do you do away with the power of God you're not going to overcome that's so and that's that this is something that as you begin to read the church ages you're going to find oh brother brandom's going to hit those guys those those those guys in that false in that false Vine speaking in tongues and prophesying and yet not living the word but on the other hand he's going to rebuke and say if you don't have the life of Pentecost in your church then you're living under you're not you're you're not there where you need to be God is wanting this church to come into a glorious fellowship with him and brother this means that we can't just learn it we got to have a revelation of who we are what we are and brother the power of God's here to make it to liveen can you say Amen now all right so so uh now um so until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that Hebrews Hebrews 2 and one therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels were steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience to the word received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God all and God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders diverse Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and dispised it was oppressed it was persecuted into death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern can you say amen amen so he says don't be like astray here when I said that God and his ways never change I did not say that the church and its Messengers could change could not change the church isn't God so she can change but what I said was that because of the unchanging God with the unchanging ways now here we go we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judge by that standard that how that is how it is done the true church will always try to be like the original of Pentecost the true church today will try to approximate the early first one the messengers to the church having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the one that come the closest who will be free of all men sold out to God Gave forth the word of God only and manifested the power and the Holy Ghost in power none else would do you have to work from the be the original as like begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age it is that simple and that wonderful amen can you say Amen to that now so so you can see what brother brand I'm now I'm going to I'm the time has already got away from me so we're going to close but I I want to I want to show you something in this sardian church now now we're the sardian church age is is this one that I put the blue in uh uh up here now this is the one that is starting to come that is starting to come forth and and and it's the reformation and so uh it doesn't look anything like the Pentecostal church and so brother bradam is putting a few things in there and I was going to read well I was going to read you 10 pages out of that but we're not going to do that amen but but I do I do want to read um uh page 250 uh and you can you can write these things down uh page 250 in the middle of the of the second paragraph um brother brother Bram was is is now he's now he's now we We've Come Through the Dark Ages and and um uh I have a reason for the way I'm doing this tonight because I'm trying I'm trying to put the end product of what God is looking for don't look at this as if I'm just reading history no brother brandom is trying to show you what you're supposed to be at the end what we're going to be at the end what he want what God's got in his mind y'all understanding so so it's a pent don't don't read this a as just a mere student but Lord I want to be able to see all of the works of the Antichrist and what he has done to try to make that church lukewarm and Powerless I want to get rid of that so that I can believe God for the supernatural in my life and everyone else's life I'm telling you this this message this message is a message of divine Glory Hallelujah the the the the 19 1906 don't they didn't even have a they don't have a candle of what took and that was glorious that was a work of God brother randam said it was a work of Grace it was the third stage of of restoration but he says and it looked a lot like it but he says no that that had a lot of man in it he says what this is that we're going to is something more glorious it's a matured bride she's been given a matured word she knows who she is can you say say Amen all right page 250 the middle of the second uh page or yeah the second paragraph amen it says again the scripture says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power and he went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil as Jesus went away he told his disciples to T at Pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them then that called out body the church would be in his stad upon the Earth taking his place and because that same spirit that was in him would be in them they would do the very same works and any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same work as Jesus did in the Pentecost and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have that Spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account unto God now that's that's quite a that's quite a judgment call talking to our age here because we're we're not we're not in that that that fifth or that sixth or even at the beginning of that seventh we're we're at the ending let's go to the next page let's go to the next page there and uh we go one it's in it's in the that that second paragraph that's starting of it he says yes uh and there you know I'm just I'm I'm just highlighting this to wet your whistle yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same the seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be an A A Pentecost Church there will be tongues interpretation prophecy healings God will be in the midst of her God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has Hallelujah she will be unorganized don't forget that can you say Amen so so as he's as he's telling as he's going and bringing brother brandom uh in this start as Church age now they had already come out and and uh came out of the Catholic church and it wasn't uh uh Martin Luther there in the 1500s Martin Luther had came in and he and he put the 95 thesis and and and and he started the Reformation swept the world and so uh and and and and the Sardis Church brother bam you know as as God is giving the giving the uh the Benedict to the to the church now that they had came out you've heard uh uh you know he he had told him he says Thou H has a name that you're living but you're dead he says Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain that are ready to die for I've have not found thy works perfect before God remember what thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent now the message had came but already it wasn't too very long and they had already built denominations and set up set up men to run their their church I Martin Luther had barely died had barely died and they were already organizing and before you know it we had all of these uh uh we had z uh swindley we had we had uh Knox and Calvin we had all of these other guys and they were all sitting up and and and brother brandham is is is is telling them he says now he's he gives the he gives the interpretation I Know Thy Works what were these works that came before the Lord and caused his displeasure well you know that each age lapped over into the next age we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age into the fifth these works are as as you are are well aware uh were number one he has number one written down the leadership of the Holy Ghost was superseded by human hierarchy number two the the pure word of God and its free benefit to all men was deposed for Creeds dogmas Church orders and ETC number three the worship in the spirit and the gifts of the Spirit and all which pertains to the true Community Fellowship of the Saints was cast aside for litery Idol uh uh and literal idol worship Pagan feasts ETC number four Mary alery was assuming a greater place in the Christian worship until she had actually assumed a place of the godhead and the son was was brought forth brought from his lofty position uh of of overall to being s uh subservient to a man called the pope who termed himself the viker of Christ and and and then and then he goes he goes on down you know talking about how that they started they started literally persecuting uh the people that did not agree with them so so what what I what what Satan what what Satan has tried to do do all through these ages he wanted to kill the church and then every time as the leaf began to grow as the power of God begin to come up came through Wesley or or through Luther through through the through the the leaves well they wanted to stay there but the life Gods got a Pentecostal Church he's not wanting a place for us to just stop go to church and worship he's wanting a living Pentecostal Church y'all understand that when Luther refused when Luther's group refused to keep on growing with the plant what happened they organized they died they the life of God left that church and they begin to persecute anybody that didn't agree with them life of God was gone but the life kept going on and finally here come Wesley and then here come see you see what I'm saying we don't want to put my my thoughts here tonight is do not you're going to see in the church age book don't put a period on your experience with God Amen don't put a period we have got a church this church age is going is ending with an eternal Church age this people is this group is is not going the way of the grave in another church age this group is catching a Rapture that means there's a people who's going to believe God I believe you're that people I I I believe this message has found you amen and predestinated you and the life of God is in this message Amen in this message to make to to to to live his life in you now the Pentecostals now what are they trying to do now they had the life of God in 1906 that was true you go back and read the the history of my 1906 and it was a powerful powerful powerful thing that God was doing in 1906 amen but within three years they were all by 1909 they had already organized they and the and the power of God had already shut down when brother brandham came on the scene in the 30s there wasn't even there was not even a a a talking about the the healing anymore there was not talking about miracles anymore here they lived under the power of the Holy Ghost in the early 1900s and by the time that brother brandham came on and the angel visited him it was it was it was unheard of the Pentecostal organizations were many they they had so many Pentecostal organizations but it all died off now the organizations were still going yeah but they had went to music yeah they had went to trying to make it up they were trying they were trying to they had lost the power of God so now they're trying to work it up with fleshly manifestations God don't want fleshly manifestations God wants the supernatural living among the people you don't have to work this up just believe what you got am the life is in his word and when we accept that and believe every word hallelujah brother brand he says that's a Pentecostal Church coming then believe that don't put it aside that's what he is coming for I I and I missed my other quote but I I don't brother brother bradam says that is God's goal that's what he said it's his the Pentecostal church is God's goal don't fight it say Lord here here I am anoint me like you did them here live your I don't want to just learn it I don't want to just have moral cold I want the very life of the Holy Spirit living in me can you say amen that's what we want and here at the church we're not we're not we're we're we're not we're not making nothing up but I am as a minister I am wanting to see such an expectation in every one of us in this church such an expectation for God to fulfill his word such an expectation for another Pentecost such an expectation you say well brother wend that's that you're trying to take us back to 1906 I'm skip 1906 I'm talking about what God what brother brandham said his goal is a Pentecostal church and it won't have none of that fleshly stuff in it it it'll have the power of the Holy Ghost come on but you got to believe what the prophet said you got to believe it you're the church this is the adoption message this is the finality you're here brother there ain't nothing else to come you got it start believing what he says about you yes amen well glory to God if the musicians would come amen amen amen all right so so did I help any tonight are y'all did y'all understand where I'm at there the spirit of the Antichrist and brother Brandon's going to be dealing with him in in those four different ways he's going to be dealing with all through that church ages and he's going to be showing you how it's the spirit of the enemy trying to take away the expectation for God to fulfill his word amen well God don't God don't do that anymore well we don't believe that anymore well well you know it don't matter anymore no if God says it I'm expecting God to still believe it amen Holiness is right because God said so amen the power of the Holy Ghost is right because God said so amen now I I would um uh I I I would I would like for us to just now start in those uh we we I I would i' encourage you to start at the very beginning but I uh uh you know with the revelation of Jesus Christ and the patmas vision and uh we we covered a lot of that in um in in when we were talking about the lampstands and things like that but brother brandham has got on the godhead and things is just so powerful so I'd encourage you to start right there with the Book of Revelation or the revelation of Jesus Christ but I'd like for us um and and just start reading those things and then um and then we're going to we're going to try to start getting into the Ephesian Church age and just take start taking some nuggets out of those things now remember we're not at the we're not at the at the leaf stage here amen we're thankful for what God done uh through through Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostal but I'm wanting us to remember the goal the goal God has a goal God has a goal that goal is a bride to know who she is what is this book here you say well this was given before the Seven Seals well you know he preached the seven Church ages in 60 that is true but the book did not come out until 65 and he has a lot more in this than what he had in the church ages and he and he he he went through with brother Lee Vil telling him to put this in and put that in brother lale was the one that was pinning it but brother brandham was the one that wrote it and when brother brandham in 1965 um I believe it's the Rapture and he talks about how many books he has he says I the only book I or he says the book I wrote I wrote the the the seven Church ages so some people say brother brandham didn't write it that someone else wrote it but brother brandham wrote this book under the inspiration and under the light of the open book under the light of the opening of the word the Seven Seals are y'all y'all I'm telling you right now that those seals and these Church ages are just man Satan hates them Satan hates the church age book and Satan hates the Seven Seals Satan hates any message after 1963 but I'm glad that we've got it all right right right here I I I I do amen I I I believe that open book and there's just so many wonderful wonderful things and so I'd encourage you to to um to really take this seriously how many's going to take this seriously Glory I am blessed I am blessed every day that I live I am [Music] blessed when I wake up in the morning and I lay my

stage well there's something more than than than than than receiving the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the new birth we're here this is the adoption this is the Capstone message this is the manifestation that God is looking it the message is here you're the people now what we want to do is when we're opening this book up and we're seeing everything how Satan has defiled and tried to take everything out I'm asking you right now to just make up your mind I am going to see how Satan has done it in every other age and he ain't doing it to this one God has opened the secrets up I'm going to find how that worked against them and I'm going to learn from their mistakes that's that's the good thing about the baby in the in the family you know he gets to learn from the older ones mistakes amen and uh but we're but but we're Rising we're Rising under the power of the holy spirit this is your hour you say I well when that adoption comes aren't aren't aren't you supposed to isn't that isn't that supposed to be set up and God says this is my son and and he tells the world well what has happened what has happened in 19 since 1963 God has come to this church she's come into that maturity and he is stepping out and saying listen I've given you this book no other other no other age was given the open book you're the one why wait for something way off he's given it to you in this generation amen hallelujah the only thing brother Brown says the only thing that's going to keep us men those other those other rims he said the only thing that even keeps you from creating
