[39:10] if you're on into the second and third
[39:12] age you will see how how that that the
[39:16] the life of God was always snuffed out
[39:20] man when God would send a move then
[39:23] Satan would come in and he would he
[39:25] would let let put you know let the fire

[44:41] someday amen is that your desire when
[44:44] the battle's over with we fight the last
[44:46] mind battle and to hear those words
[44:49] welcome home th good and faithful
[44:51] servant amen that's what I want to hear
[44:53] amen if you have your Bibles let's open
[44:56] our scriptures to Daniel
[45:00] 11:32 you happy to be in the house of
[45:02] the Lord this
[45:05] morning
[45:07] amen praise the
[45:09] Lord Daniel 11:32 and i' I've sort of
[45:13] been just reading through Daniel myself
[45:15] here lately and that's a powerful book
[45:17] to to go through and to listen to the
[45:19] messages brother Brandon preached on
[45:21] Daniel so I might take a little bit of
[45:23] that this morning a few different
[45:26] thoughts I pray everything can come
[45:27] together and make sense but Daniel 11:32
[45:31] and such as do wickedly against the
[45:34] Covenant shall shall he corrupt by
[45:36] flatteries but the people that do know
[45:39] their God shall be strong and do
[45:41] exploits amen can we bow our heads this
[45:44] morning dear gracious Heavenly Father
[45:46] Lord what an honor and a privilege it is
[45:48] to come into your house father Lord
[45:50] you've been so good to us Lord you've
[45:53] kept us safe throughout the this last
[45:55] week Lord give his health in our bodies
[45:57] father Lord as we come into this part of
[45:59] the service I ask that you would speak
[46:01] through the lips of clay this morning
[46:03] Lord you see the hearts and the desires
[46:04] Lord the needs that are in the people
[46:07] father Lord I ask that you would move
[46:09] this morning in a mighty way father Lord
[46:11] send your anointing father send
[46:12] inspiration this morning we ask these
[46:15] things in your precious name amen and
[46:18] you may be seated and if I had a subject
[46:21] this morning it would be a people that
[46:22] know their God and brother brandom would
[46:25] would place the scripture at the end
[46:27] time and he would say uh and say this
[46:29] and that Daniel said about these last
[46:31] days how that they know their God and
[46:34] will do exploits and just so many
[46:36] scriptures tying in this day that we're
[46:38] living in how how that these evil
[46:41] deceiving times would be on the earth
[46:43] and just exactly what we're having now
[46:45] fulfills it they had a chance they had
[46:47] been given a chance to see the Messiah
[46:50] uh but they rejected their very Messiah
[46:52] and today it's the same thing the very
[46:54] same thing we are given the opportunity
[46:57] another place brother brandom says and
[46:59] Daniel said in the in that day they
[47:01] shall run to and fr knowledge shall
[47:03] increase and he he said and the wise
[47:05] shall know their God and that day and do
[47:07] shall shall do great exploits in that
[47:09] day but the wicked will not know the god
[47:12] of Heaven they know him in a form and in
[47:14] a ritual so the Bible is telling us of
[47:17] two different people two separate two
[47:19] separate groups and what's going to
[47:21] separate the two is understanding who
[47:24] God is and but the R would tell us the
[47:26] world has been given their chance to
[47:29] understand God have been given their
[47:30] chance to know him but they have
[47:32] rejected him but the only way we can do
[47:35] exploits is for a people to understand
[47:38] who God is and to know him but I don't
[47:41] believe that the people that the Bible
[47:43] is talking about is just a random people
[47:46] but it's a chosen people because if
[47:48] there wasn't a chosen people they would
[47:50] have rejected their chance to see him as
[47:52] well you see a caral mind can never
[47:56] understand the word never understand the
[47:58] message and many of us can never
[48:00] understand the message without God
[48:02] coming and revealing it to us so if it
[48:04] wasn't a chosen people a predestinated
[48:07] people before the foundation of the
[48:09] world we would never know God and would
[48:12] never be able to achieve what God has
[48:14] for that people and brother Brandon
[48:16] would say notice God when he called
[48:18] Abraham he didn't say Abraham if you
[48:20] would do a certain thing then I would do
[48:22] a certain thing he said Abraham I have
[48:25] already done it not what you did what I
[48:27] did what God did he said now when he
[48:30] made a covenant with Adam if you if you
[48:32] not touch the tree you'll live forever
[48:34] but Adam broke it Moses and them if you
[48:36] keep the Commandments I'll do so and so
[48:39] if you break the Commandments I'll do so
[48:41] and so when God makes a covenant with
[48:43] man man breaks the Covenant with God but
[48:46] so that the elected the church the
[48:48] elected people the called out separated
[48:51] group of people would sure to be saved
[48:54] God called them by his grace so this
[48:57] ain't just any people but it's an
[48:59] elected people that's been called by his
[49:02] grace it's a people that's a part of
[49:04] Abraham's not Abraham's natural seed but
[49:06] the Royal seed the faith seed so
[49:09] everybody is trying to be that people
[49:12] everybody wants to be the bride of
[49:13] Christ but not everybody is chosen to be
[49:16] the bride of Christ there's only one
[49:18] person one group that's been called by
[49:21] his grace that is the people not anybody
[49:24] you can't claim to be the people you you
[49:27] can't join the people you got to be
[49:28] called to be these people and the Bible
[49:31] would tell us I have you have not chosen
[49:33] me but I have chosen you and that's a
[49:36] revelation that we can grab a hold of in
[49:38] this generation I haven't put myself in
[49:41] the bride God put me in the bride I
[49:44] haven't put myself in this body in this
[49:47] people but God chose me to be in this
[49:50] people so if God has chose me to be in
[49:53] this body there's nothing that can keep
[49:56] me from do knowing my God and doing
[49:59] exploits brother Brandon would take that
[50:01] that that scripture and call it exploits
[50:03] of Faith he said it's a super race a a
[50:06] natural people with the supernatural God
[50:09] coming to them and doing Supernatural
[50:11] signs it's not that we're trying to
[50:14] achieve something it's one knowing our
[50:16] God we've come in contact with the
[50:19] supernatural being and the supernatural
[50:21] being is performing the exploits
[50:24] performing the Deeds performing the
[50:26] works but first you got to know who you
[50:29] are you see you got to know that it's
[50:31] Grace that has chosen you You' never be
[50:34] able to work your way into it it's the
[50:36] grace of God Peter was unable to choose
[50:39] Christ before the Crow twice but
[50:42] Grace still put him in the body it was
[50:44] Grace that said go tell my disciples and
[50:47] tell Peter it was Grace that chose him
[50:50] even though he couldn't choose him oh my
[50:53] and when whenever the Apostle Paul was
[50:55] denying Christ Christ still chose him
[50:58] and when maybe you denied this word
[51:00] maybe you've denied that you're a
[51:02] Christian throughout your life maybe
[51:03] you've got a past that you're ashamed of
[51:06] but you didn't choose it Grace chose you
[51:09] the grace of God before the foundation
[51:12] of the world says I'm going to have a
[51:14] people that's going to know me I'm going
[51:17] to have a part and in that people his
[51:20] individuals they might have failures
[51:22] they might got mistakes they might have
[51:25] might have things they're not proud of
[51:27] but it's going to be by my grace that is
[51:29] going to call them and place them in
[51:32] this people so that they can do exploits
[51:36] oh when the in the day where there's
[51:38] nonsense and there's a hypocritical
[51:40] going around there is a people that know
[51:43] their God by Grace know their God and
[51:47] they're performing the supernatural
[51:49] signs oh my that's why there's an
[51:52] invincible Army upon Earth they know
[51:55] they're God they've come in contact with
[51:58] the supernatural being oh Hallelujah it
[52:00] was Moses that had a calling on his life
[52:03] and wanted to do something for God but
[52:06] did not have the ability to do exploits
[52:09] but one time he come in contact with the
[52:12] supernatural God and what was inside of
[52:15] the burning bush didn't stay there but
[52:17] then come inside of Moses to perform the
[52:21] exploits and oh my I believe what was
[52:24] inside of this message is no longer just
[52:27] there but it's come inside of the people
[52:30] so that there can be exploits upon the
[52:33] Earth just like in the books of Acts oh
[52:36] Hallelujah people knows their God
[52:39] they've got to know their God Amen oh
[52:42] the Bible would say in Ephesians 1:4
[52:45] according as he had chosen Us in him
[52:48] from before the foundation of the world
[52:51] so it ain't you know brother Brandon
[52:52] preaches you don't become a son of God
[52:55] at the new birth you was always a Son of
[52:57] God that's why you can be reborned so he
[53:00] wasn't chosen when we're when we're born
[53:02] on the Earth God didn't say okay I'm
[53:04] going to choose that one okay I'm not
[53:06] going to choose that one that baby's
[53:08] cute so I'm going to choose that one
[53:10] before you was ever on this Earth before
[53:12] Adam was ever on this Earth You was
[53:14] chosen to be a part of this people and
[53:18] you see so it ain't a natural bloodline
[53:21] that puts us in this people it's a
[53:23] spiritual bloodline because the
[53:25] Pharisees could trace their bloodline
[53:27] back to Abraham but they wasn't chosen
[53:30] they wasn't called but then there was a
[53:32] Samaritan of the wh that could not Trace
[53:35] her bloodline back to Abraham she was a
[53:38] Samaritan but God chose her God chose
[53:40] her to perform exploits so it ain't a
[53:44] natural bloodline it's a spiritual
[53:46] bloodline the Bible would tell us in
[53:48] Galatians 3 and 28 there was neither Jew
[53:51] nor Greek neither Bond nor free there
[53:53] was neither male nor female for ye are
[53:56] all one in Christ Jesus and if you be
[53:58] Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and
[54:01] hires according to the promise oh my so
[54:05] if we're a part of the a part of the
[54:08] spiritual bloodline then we are put in
[54:10] this people and their HS according to
[54:13] the promise oh my that means whatever
[54:16] Christ have we have it's not because I'm
[54:19] a Martin not because you're a Smith not
[54:21] because you're a green but because you
[54:23] were called by grace for this generation
[54:27] and put you to to perform the Greater
[54:30] Works and since we're called to be this
[54:32] people The Works of God is expressing
[54:35] itself oh my if you be Christ then you
[54:38] are Abraham's seat but Brandon would say
[54:40] Not seeds but seed he said because after
[54:44] Sarah had died Abraham Abraham had seven
[54:46] more children so it ain't seeds it's a
[54:49] seed and he said that and and it's not a
[54:52] natural seed but it's the spiritual seed
[54:54] the Ro your seat the people that know
[54:57] their God and I believe that is that
[54:58] this scripture is being fulfilled in
[55:01] this generation there are somebody that
[55:03] knows their God and I heard brother
[55:05] Samuel Browning make a statement one
[55:08] time he says we're not living in an hour
[55:10] where're promises are being made but
[55:12] we're it's the hour where promises are
[55:14] being fulfilled and I think my we're not
[55:17] we're not looking for God to make a
[55:19] promise that there's going to be a
[55:21] people that time is already passed we're
[55:23] living in the Fulfillment
[55:25] that there is now a people we're not
[55:28] looking for a people but there is now a
[55:30] people we're not looking for the Greater
[55:32] Works but there is now the Greater Works
[55:35] we're not looking for exploits the
[55:37] achievement of faith is now upon the
[55:40] earth oh my so I believe it's a literal
[55:43] people that the Bible was talking about
[55:46] a literal people knowing a reality
[55:49] coming in contact and experiencing the
[55:52] power of it and that's why I believe
[55:54] this message here's the realities of
[55:57] Jesus Christ without it being a reality
[56:00] you can never know him but once it
[56:02] becomes a reality you know him oh my you
[56:06] know brother brandom talks about the
[56:07] three room house he says you've got the
[56:09] kitchen you've got the living room and
[56:11] you got the bedroom he says in the
[56:13] kitchen you eat in the b in the living
[56:15] room you Fellowship but in that bedroom
[56:18] is when the one the man and the woman
[56:20] know each other and life produces and he
[56:22] talks about where where uh we got how un
[56:25] being there's the Body Soul and Spirit
[56:27] and he says it can come on the body it
[56:29] can come on the spirit but it needs to
[56:31] come inside of the Soul we don't believe
[56:34] from the spirit we don't believe from
[56:36] the body we don't believe from the mind
[56:38] we believe from the soul and so if it
[56:41] never anchors in the soul it's never a
[56:44] reality so if it anchors in the spirit
[56:46] when you're depressed it's going to move
[56:49] away if it's on the body when you're
[56:51] aching the Revelation is going to go
[56:53] away but if it anchors in the soul
[56:56] that's where life produces oh Hallelujah
[56:59] that's where life produces it's no
[57:02] longer just talking about the exploits
[57:05] it's no longer just feeding on the word
[57:07] but the word and the people the bride
[57:10] has come together in a unity and it's
[57:13] producing the life it's producing the
[57:15] exploits the promised child in this
[57:18] generation oh Hallelujah and that's why
[57:21] he makes a separation and if you read
[57:23] Daniel and it's going through some dark
[57:26] times it's saying this people's going to
[57:28] be Wicked they're going to do that
[57:30] they're going to do this but then he
[57:32] stops and he says but the people but I
[57:35] just love that word it's it separates
[57:38] the two it's a dark time they're Wicked
[57:41] they're doing this but there's going to
[57:43] be a people that's going to have a god
[57:45] anchored in their soul and because of
[57:48] that anchor they're going to produce
[57:52] exploits oh Hallelujah so if you want to
[57:55] see God you've got to understand God if
[57:58] you want to see the supernatural you've
[58:00] got to understand what the supernal
[58:03] is you see brother Brandon would say so
[58:06] many people have different opinions of
[58:08] Christ as as as I travel different parts
[58:11] of the country and around the world I
[58:13] find so many people have their different
[58:15] opinions you'll be surprised to know
[58:18] what some of their opinions are some of
[58:20] them thinks that he's a wonderful
[58:22] teacher and he says well he was that
[58:25] that that's just exactly and he says
[58:27] many of them thinks he was the great
[58:29] philosopher which he was that certainly
[58:31] he was and then some of them think he
[58:33] was a good man he was but see he was
[58:36] more than that he was more than all of
[58:39] that plus he says some of them think he
[58:41] was a prophet he was a prophet but he
[58:44] was more than a prophet he was the
[58:46] prophet plus and he says and see so we
[58:49] have to how would we know if he was
[58:52] teaching of his teachings he was a
[58:54] teacher he was a great philosopher but
[58:57] the only way we'll ever know him today
[58:59] is if we identify him for today and I
[59:03] believe that he raised from the dead I
[59:05] believe with all of my heart I believe
[59:06] that he's promised here he's the same
[59:09] yesterday today and forever so it's
[59:12] different opinions of Christ looking at
[59:15] the same word at the same individual but
[59:17] have different opinions but before you
[59:19] know him you got to know if you're right
[59:22] or if you're wrong you know it's always
[59:25] it's always aggravating when you're in
[59:27] an argument and you don't know if you're
[59:28] right you're you're just hoping that
[59:30] you're right because if you're wrong
[59:32] you're in trouble there's nothing
[59:34] backing you up you know and there's so
[59:36] many different people with different
[59:38] opinions but there's nothing there's no
[59:41] Assurance behind them backing up the
[59:43] word but God has sent us something in
[59:46] this generation where we don't got to be
[59:49] nervous we don't got to know if it's
[59:51] true or if it's right if we're in the
[59:53] Battleground with the SP spirit and we
[59:55] don't know but if we know our God if we
[59:59] know our God anchored in the soul we can
[1:00:02] go through every Spirit we can go
[1:00:05] through every complex we can go through
[1:00:08] every influence knowing what I'm
[1:00:10] standing on is true and if I'm standing
[1:00:13] on something true all of Heaven is
[1:00:16] backing me up bless the Lord oh
[1:00:18] hallelujah hallelujah oh my so that's
[1:00:21] why it's only a special class of people
[1:00:23] that can know him because knowing him
[1:00:26] comes by identifying him and not anybody
[1:00:29] can identify him you got to recognize
[1:00:31] him you remember when Nathaniel met
[1:00:33] Jesus it wasn't what Jesus was wearing
[1:00:36] that identified him to Nathaniel it was
[1:00:39] what Jesus was producing that identified
[1:00:42] him because everybody was looking up a
[1:00:44] garments everybody was looking up a
[1:00:46] parents everybody was looking at the
[1:00:49] outside and never identified him as the
[1:00:52] word for the day but Daniel didn't look
[1:00:55] at the garments he didn't look up
[1:00:57] parrots he looked at the word and says
[1:01:00] this is my identification this is what
[1:01:02] the word said he would do today oh man I
[1:01:06] believe the people is that way today
[1:01:09] we've identified the word for this
[1:01:12] generation we've recognized that this
[1:01:14] ain't something for the 60s but it's
[1:01:17] something for today it's not a god of
[1:01:19] yesterday but I'm identifying him as the
[1:01:23] god of today I'm recognizing that God
[1:01:26] can still heal the sick that God still
[1:01:28] keeps marriages together I'm recognizing
[1:01:31] him so that I can know him oh you got to
[1:01:35] recognize him in order to know him
[1:01:37] because you can look at somebody and if
[1:01:39] you don't recognize them you can never
[1:01:41] know him oh my you see I as an
[1:01:45] evangelist I go to new churches and I've
[1:01:48] only talk to pastors on the phone and
[1:01:50] it's so it's so crazy the mental image
[1:01:52] you can get in your mind if if you've
[1:01:54] never met nobody before and then you
[1:01:56] come to the church you know I went to I
[1:01:58] went to uh they had a a youth gathering
[1:02:01] on a Saturday and I just talked to the
[1:02:03] pastor on the phone and I walked into
[1:02:05] the the the Gathering the building and I
[1:02:06] didn't have a clue who this pastor was
[1:02:09] I'm just walking I heard his voice so
[1:02:11] I'm just walking around you know I
[1:02:13] didn't have a clue who he was and so
[1:02:15] without me recognizing him I could never
[1:02:18] know him if I seen a picture of him then
[1:02:21] I could compare the picture with the
[1:02:24] person
[1:02:25] and then I can recognize oh this is who
[1:02:27] it is oh come on now and that's what the
[1:02:30] scripture is it's a picture of what
[1:02:33] Christ is in this generation and without
[1:02:36] recognizing the Christ this word this
[1:02:39] message is what the Bible is talking
[1:02:41] about you'll never know him but what you
[1:02:44] recognize that this is thus sayith the
[1:02:46] Lord this is the word behold I send
[1:02:49] Elijah the Prophet this is the word
[1:02:51] that's getting a people ready for a
[1:02:53] rapture I'm the people that's going to
[1:02:56] know God and the way I'm going to know
[1:02:59] God is to recognize what he's doing in
[1:03:02] this generation oh I'm going to identify
[1:03:05] him so that I can know him oh Hallelujah
[1:03:09] you see brother the Brandon would say
[1:03:11] but what would identify him would be the
[1:03:14] identification that the scripture says
[1:03:17] that he would be and that's how we have
[1:03:19] to identify that's that's how we have to
[1:03:21] identify him that's the way he was
[1:03:23] identified then okay he says because he
[1:03:26] wasn't a spectacular man in a certain
[1:03:29] array of dress he had no organization
[1:03:32] that he boasted of he had no credentials
[1:03:35] from any certain Fellowship he couldn't
[1:03:37] he could say I I belong to the biggest
[1:03:39] or see he had he only had the works of
[1:03:42] God that was proven and spoken of that
[1:03:45] would identify him that was his
[1:03:48] credentials I just love that that was
[1:03:51] his credentials was the works that were
[1:03:53] spoken
[1:03:54] and proven and then brother Brandon
[1:03:57] would say his dress wasn't what proved
[1:03:59] who he was and I'm going to make I'm
[1:04:02] going to say something here too many
[1:04:04] times people's looking at the dress and
[1:04:06] and they're determining if God's going
[1:04:08] to move or not many people look at a
[1:04:10] certain preacher and say we're only
[1:04:12] going to see God if that preacher is
[1:04:14] preaching you're looking at the dress
[1:04:16] you're never going to see God if you're
[1:04:18] looking at a person you're never going
[1:04:20] to see God if you're looking at a gift
[1:04:22] but look past the dress
[1:04:24] look past the individual it don't matter
[1:04:27] who's preaching as long as it's the word
[1:04:30] of God oh Hallelujah as long as it's the
[1:04:33] word of God coming across the pull pit
[1:04:35] it is the supernatural it is Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ
[1:04:40] himself oh my but don't be look don't be
[1:04:43] guilty of looking at a certain vessel
[1:04:46] and instead of the word because he
[1:04:48] promised to send his word at the end
[1:04:50] time not a gift he promised to reveal
[1:04:53] the Mysteries not a mission not not a
[1:04:56] Ministry and so if you get focused at
[1:04:58] one thing we're going to miss we're
[1:05:00] going to we're we're not going to
[1:05:02] identify what God is doing but I say
[1:05:04] let's get our focus upon one thing not a
[1:05:08] Ministry not a preacher not a man but
[1:05:10] Jesus Christ the word for this
[1:05:13] generation then we can know God oh
[1:05:16] Hallelujah and brother Brandon would say
[1:05:19] this the scriptures is what testifies of
[1:05:21] him see that's what identified him him
[1:05:24] was the scripture you believe that
[1:05:26] that's what will identify him today then
[1:05:29] we know whether we're right or not
[1:05:32] whether it was him he was the same he
[1:05:35] would do the same and that just struck
[1:05:38] me as I as I read that this morning then
[1:05:40] once we identify him then we will know
[1:05:44] if we're right or if we're
[1:05:45] wrong it's simple as that once you
[1:05:48] identify him you're never going to have
[1:05:52] that voice in the back part of your mind
[1:05:53] saying I don't know if this is true I
[1:05:55] don't know if it I don't know if it's
[1:05:57] right but once you identify him come on
[1:06:00] now once you identify him all that goes
[1:06:03] away now I'm going to tell on myself for
[1:06:06] a second you know and I I've preached
[1:06:08] and I've believed that the seals are
[1:06:10] open that the mighty Angel come down to
[1:06:12] the Earthly angel with an open book and
[1:06:15] I've always believed that but I I I've
[1:06:17] looked for quotes and to be honest I
[1:06:19] never could find one and I don't know if
[1:06:21] I was searching the wrong way but I
[1:06:23] searched and I church and and there's
[1:06:25] many people that don't believe that and
[1:06:27] there would be times I would be
[1:06:28] preaching for individuals and that was
[1:06:29] in the back part of my mind that man if
[1:06:31] he ever challenges me on it I'm not
[1:06:33] going to have nothing to back it up but
[1:06:35] then one time we we was at brother
[1:06:37] Wayne's what a month or so ago and and
[1:06:40] we was talking with brother Wayne and he
[1:06:41] he he quoted the quote and I thought
[1:06:44] whoa that's what I've been looking for
[1:06:46] and it was great to hear him quote it
[1:06:49] but then he sent it to me and this is
[1:06:50] what brother brandham says talk about a
[1:06:52] jubilee talk about a time what the lamb
[1:06:55] walk forth see the books even sealed in
[1:06:57] heaven the Mysteries are say is my name
[1:06:59] there I don't know I hope it is but if
[1:07:02] it is it was put there put there on the
[1:07:05] book before the foundation of the world
[1:07:07] but the first thing that represented
[1:07:09] that Redemption come the lamb that had
[1:07:11] been slain from before the foundation of
[1:07:14] the world and he took the book glory to
[1:07:17] opened the book tore off the seals and
[1:07:19] sent it down to the Earth to a seventh
[1:07:22] angel to reveal it to his people there
[1:07:25] you are and I'm telling you what just
[1:07:28] just to be honest I was liberated I read
[1:07:30] that quote and there was a courage that
[1:07:32] come inside of my heart say I it's not
[1:07:35] my word it's God's word it ain't me just
[1:07:38] saying this happened God said it happen
[1:07:41] and that's the way it is with the
[1:07:43] message once you connect it once you get
[1:07:46] a revelation something anchors them the
[1:07:48] soul that it's not my word it's God's
[1:07:51] word it's not my Rapture it's God
[1:07:54] preparing us for a Rapture I'm not
[1:07:56] trying to be good enough it's god making
[1:07:59] me good enough it's a courage that gets
[1:08:02] a hold of the soul that you can step
[1:08:05] through every critic you can walk
[1:08:07] through every unbeliever and still have
[1:08:09] an anchor amen oh Hallelujah I I
[1:08:13] identified with what I believed with
[1:08:16] God's word and I'm telling you what that
[1:08:18] place the courage on the inside of my
[1:08:21] heart that I can preach it I can preach
[1:08:23] through every critic I can preach
[1:08:25] through every skeptic and that's what
[1:08:27] makes these men of God so so incredible
[1:08:30] is they can preach through every
[1:08:32] unbelief they can preach through every
[1:08:34] Spirit they can they can preach through
[1:08:36] every nonsense because they know what
[1:08:39] they're saying is backed up and you may
[1:08:41] say well Josh I'm not a preacher but
[1:08:43] it's the same way with the congregation
[1:08:46] if you ever know your God you ever get a
[1:08:49] revelation for yourself it's no longer
[1:08:52] your opinion it's thus sayith the Lord
[1:08:55] and with thus sayith the Lord comes
[1:08:59] exploits oh Hallelujah thus sayith the
[1:09:02] Lord produces the exploits but you see a
[1:09:07] revelation then produces a courage you
[1:09:10] see it sees the victory you see brother
[1:09:12] Brandon was saying Little David standing
[1:09:14] there with a little piece of leather
[1:09:16] goat skin or sheep skin with two pieces
[1:09:19] of string tied to it but it was revealed
[1:09:22] to him revelation struck him amen he
[1:09:25] said the god that took me out of the
[1:09:27] poles of the bear that took me out of
[1:09:29] the poles of the lion how much more what
[1:09:32] he delivered that uncircumcised
[1:09:34] Philistine into my hand he identified
[1:09:38] that the same God that was yesterday is
[1:09:41] the same God that is today oh let's
[1:09:44] identify him today the same God that was
[1:09:48] with me yesterday is the same God that
[1:09:50] is with me today it ain't a hope so it
[1:09:53] ain't a guessing a guessing game but
[1:09:56] it's a revelation that the same God that
[1:09:59] was in the book of Acts is the same God
[1:10:02] today I've identified him that he is
[1:10:05] working today and brother Brandon
[1:10:07] continues on to say his brothers was
[1:10:10] more able to do what Saw Head and
[1:10:12] Shoulders above his army but you see it
[1:10:15] wasn't revealed to them oh man it wasn't
[1:10:18] revealed to them am man there it is they
[1:10:21] believed it could be done they believed
[1:10:23] God could do it but it wasn't revealed
[1:10:25] to them but it was revealed to David see
[1:10:29] there's the difference right there if
[1:10:31] it's absolutely revealed to you that God
[1:10:34] is going to heal you you're going to do
[1:10:37] it you're going to get it I don't care
[1:10:39] what's wrong with you what the odds are
[1:10:42] it may be worse than David and Goliath
[1:10:45] but if it is revealed to you oh you may
[1:10:49] say this one is more capable they don't
[1:10:52] got the Revelation you you've got the
[1:10:54] Revelation come on now you may say that
[1:10:56] one over there is smarter than I am that
[1:10:59] don't matter you've got the revelation
[1:11:01] God didn't come and anoint anoint
[1:11:04] David's Brothers he anointed David and
[1:11:07] gave him a calling to produce exploits
[1:11:11] oh come on now you may feel like you're
[1:11:13] the bottom of the bottom the lowest of
[1:11:15] the lowest the weakest of the weakest
[1:11:17] but if you can get a revelation no
[1:11:19] matter the odds no matter the opposition
[1:11:22] a revel
[1:11:24] is going to Prevail Hallelujah it was
[1:11:28] revealed to David that what God did
[1:11:30] yesterday he going to do today and he
[1:11:33] produced the
[1:11:35] exploits oh man it produced the exploits
[1:11:39] what produced it him being a person a
[1:11:42] people that knew his God right oh man
[1:11:46] and you can look through individuals
[1:11:48] throughout the throughout the Old
[1:11:49] Testament shamgar was is an Israelite he
[1:11:52] was circumcised he was called but
[1:11:55] without him knowing God He Was Defeated
[1:11:58] come on now we got to go on them we got
[1:12:01] to go farther than just being called we
[1:12:04] got to know our God that's the first
[1:12:06] stage of it is realizing we're called by
[1:12:08] Grace but then we got to move on into
[1:12:11] knowing god we got to know the person of
[1:12:14] this message you can quotes in
[1:12:17] scriptures is great but you got to meet
[1:12:19] the person Jesus Christ inside of this
[1:12:22] message and then that produces the
[1:12:26] exploits but then once Shem God realized
[1:12:29] who he was what God he he was serving
[1:12:32] then that produced the Revelation oh my
[1:12:35] if there's ever a people that can needs
[1:12:37] a revelation it's it's the people today
[1:12:40] that needs a revelation of who they are
[1:12:43] oh my you see because you remember the
[1:12:46] two that walked to the road to emus
[1:12:48] there was talking about Jesus in a day
[1:12:51] gone by and and I know this is pretty
[1:12:53] preach so much but it it just it really
[1:12:55] struck me that these people were these
[1:12:58] two men were talking about Jesus in the
[1:13:00] day gone by talking how he was going to
[1:13:02] be the Messiah he was this he was that
[1:13:05] and then here come Jesus walks up to him
[1:13:09] could you imagine could you imagine
[1:13:11] talking about somebody you never met and
[1:13:13] the person you're talking about comes up
[1:13:16] to you and says hey who you talking
[1:13:17] about and you turn to him and say you a
[1:13:19] stranger in these parts who are you you
[1:13:22] don't know who we're talking about and
[1:13:24] the person they're talking about is
[1:13:26] right in front of them but without
[1:13:28] identifying him they could never meet
[1:13:31] him oh come on now they were talking
[1:13:34] about a day gone by and without a
[1:13:36] without an understanding a present day
[1:13:39] truth you're going to put God in a day
[1:13:42] gone by but once you understand what the
[1:13:44] brandom says Jesus went from the went
[1:13:47] from the Old Testament went through all
[1:13:49] the scriptures preaching concerning him
[1:13:52] and brother brandom said says preaching
[1:13:54] will never bring Revelation you've got
[1:13:56] to receive it brother brandom says he
[1:13:58] went through all of the scripture
[1:14:00] concerning his life but then he stopped
[1:14:03] at his house in the evening time oh he
[1:14:06] stopped as the sun was going down and
[1:14:08] was acting as if he was going to go on
[1:14:11] but then the Bible says he they stopped
[1:14:13] him and constrained him come in with us
[1:14:16] and brother brandom says once they
[1:14:18] receive the word in then understanding
[1:14:21] come upon them their eyes was open and
[1:14:24] wanted understanding do with them do to
[1:14:27] them it took Jesus out of yesterday and
[1:14:30] brought him into today we know what
[1:14:32] happened the Bible says as he broke the
[1:14:34] bread they seen Christ and realized that
[1:14:37] the same actions that he did yesterday
[1:14:40] he's doing today but without identifying
[1:14:44] him they could never see him as today oh
[1:14:47] come on now but if we can ever identify
[1:14:49] him in this word that he is the god of
[1:14:53] today we can see the supernatural we can
[1:14:56] see the exploits we can see a god Mighty
[1:14:59] in battle this ain't a God of yesterday
[1:15:02] it's a god of today him the people that
[1:15:05] know their gods they've identified him
[1:15:08] as the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:11] and it's producing the exploits
[1:15:14] hallelujah
[1:15:16] hallelujah it's recognizing God that he
[1:15:19] can do it today oh not just yesterday
[1:15:23] where thankful for what he did in the
[1:15:24] books of Acts in the book of Acts but
[1:15:26] what is he doing
[1:15:28] today oh my recognizing means to
[1:15:32] overcome yes you see brother Brandon
[1:15:34] preaches the message how can I overcome
[1:15:36] and he says overcome means to recognize
[1:15:39] the devil in every one of his tricks
[1:15:42] lots of people say there was no devil
[1:15:45] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:15:47] that there's a real devil he's just as
[1:15:50] real as you are anybody a real devil
[1:15:53] devil and you must recognize him as real
[1:15:56] you must know he's a devil and then the
[1:15:59] same that you know he that you recognize
[1:16:01] he's a devil and he's against you then
[1:16:04] to
[1:16:05] overcome you must recognize that the god
[1:16:08] that is in you is mightier and greater
[1:16:11] than he is then once the and the one
[1:16:14] that is in you has already overcome him
[1:16:17] and by his grace you're are more than a
[1:16:19] match for him theirs were real
[1:16:22] overcoming when you
[1:16:25] recognize and something that D struct me
[1:16:28] and and you know as ministers can
[1:16:29] testify you reach something a thousand
[1:16:31] times and something just jumps out to
[1:16:33] you but the brandom says before you can
[1:16:35] overcome you don't just have to
[1:16:37] recognize the devil you got to recognize
[1:16:39] he's against you right right oh come on
[1:16:43] now you got to recognize that the
[1:16:45] spirits thr a plug in your mind is
[1:16:47] against you you got to recognize that
[1:16:50] the bitterness is against you you got to
[1:16:52] recognize that the gossip spirit is
[1:16:54] against you you got to recognize that
[1:16:56] that critical spirit ain't for you it's
[1:16:59] out to destroy you and before you can
[1:17:02] overcome you got to recognize what it
[1:17:05] really is oh because if you don't
[1:17:08] recognize it then it moves on to
[1:17:10] justifying the spirit you see definition
[1:17:13] of justifying actions is to prove or
[1:17:16] show that it is a reasonable that it's
[1:17:18] reasonable or necessary oh my so if you
[1:17:22] can never recognize that that spirit is
[1:17:25] against you you're going to justify it
[1:17:28] and as you justify it you make room for
[1:17:30] it I'm preaching now the spirit of
[1:17:32] criticalness would will split a church
[1:17:35] up it will split a family up it will
[1:17:37] split friends up but if you can never
[1:17:39] recognize that it's from the pits of
[1:17:42] hell it's going to destroy lives I'm
[1:17:44] preaching now you're going to justify it
[1:17:47] and say you don't understand what I've
[1:17:48] been through you don't understand where
[1:17:50] I come from you don't understand my make
[1:17:53] up you're justifying a devil that's
[1:17:55] going to I'm preaching now you're
[1:17:58] justifying a devil that's going to
[1:18:00] destroy a marriage destroy a family
[1:18:03] destroy your church but once you
[1:18:06] recognize you recognize that there's a
[1:18:08] real devil a real spirit and he's
[1:18:11] against you but then recognize that
[1:18:14] there's a God on earth that is greater
[1:18:17] than every Spirit greater than every
[1:18:20] critical spirit greater than every every
[1:18:23] gossip Spirit then you can find a
[1:18:25] freedom then you can
[1:18:27] overcome hey many people wonder why they
[1:18:30] can't overcome it's because they're
[1:18:31] entertaining Spirits many people under
[1:18:34] can't understand why their children
[1:18:36] can't overcome they entertaining Spirits
[1:18:39] many people think how come I can't get a
[1:18:42] move of God you're entertaining spirits
[1:18:44] but once you recognize that those
[1:18:47] Spirits are from Hell watch a victory
[1:18:50] come through your home watch your family
[1:18:52] become a Powerhouse Hallelujah that's
[1:18:55] what we need today is some parents to
[1:18:58] recognize that these spirits that I'm
[1:19:01] letting in my home are not of God
[1:19:03] they're are the enemy come on somebody
[1:19:06] we got to recognize that what we're
[1:19:08] playing with is going to destroy
[1:19:11] us true remember the man in Portland the
[1:19:15] sworded kill brother the Brandon he ran
[1:19:17] up to brother brandom and brother
[1:19:18] brandom says today you're going to fall
[1:19:20] over my feet he fell over his feet and
[1:19:22] the and the people come up to him and
[1:19:24] said wow brother Brandon is he delivered
[1:19:27] he says no he worships that
[1:19:30] Spirit come on now he worships that
[1:19:33] spirit and so many people I'm just
[1:19:35] preaching this morning so many people
[1:19:38] come to church and they lift their hands
[1:19:40] they praise God but they're justifying a
[1:19:42] critical spirit and that's the reason
[1:19:45] that their children is in the condition
[1:19:47] they are today what did Brother brandom
[1:19:49] say it's not children delinquency it's
[1:19:52] parent delinquency brother brandom says
[1:19:55] you are your parents Holy Ghost come on
[1:19:58] now the Holy Ghost is to guide them to
[1:20:00] lead them and if you got a A critical
[1:20:02] spirit that is guiding them and leading
[1:20:05] them where are they going to end up at
[1:20:07] come on now but I say let's recognize
[1:20:10] what the devil is let's recognize what
[1:20:13] the spirits are let's recognize that
[1:20:16] this is taken me down but there's a
[1:20:18] greater force that has been poured out
[1:20:21] upon the Earth today where the brandom
[1:20:23] say all of hell has been turned loose in
[1:20:26] this generation but all of Heaven has
[1:20:28] been poured out upon the briide you may
[1:20:31] feel like you can't overcome but just
[1:20:34] recognize that there's a greater force
[1:20:37] that has come to a people hallelujah
[1:20:39] it's come to a people to make them
[1:20:42] produce
[1:20:44] exploits
[1:20:45] Hallelujah so you got one side that is
[1:20:48] justifying their Spirit but then you
[1:20:51] have the other side that don't know how
[1:20:53] to overcome that
[1:20:54] Spirit come on now then there's the
[1:20:56] middle of the road you see they they
[1:20:59] realize that the spirit that's got a
[1:21:01] hold of me I can't overcome it I know
[1:21:04] it's of the devil I and if you're that
[1:21:06] way this morning you're on the right
[1:21:08] Road come on now if you realize this
[1:21:10] morning that where I am at I don't want
[1:21:13] to be at you're on the right road but
[1:21:15] don't ever get on the other side where
[1:21:17] you're justifying spirits that has taken
[1:21:20] you taken the power of God out of your
[1:21:23] home taking the power of God out of your
[1:21:26] life oh my hey I was studying on these
[1:21:29] things and this St coming to me this
[1:21:31] morning and so hey don't get mad at me
[1:21:34] if we can just recognize that what the
[1:21:37] devil's trying to put on us is of the
[1:21:40] devil then we might be able to overcome
[1:21:43] that's not what he said you can overcome
[1:21:46] but on the other side there's the people
[1:21:48] that says lord I can't overcome what do
[1:21:50] I do recognize the there's a greater
[1:21:53] force recognize that there is a God
[1:21:56] that's come to a people that is wanting
[1:21:58] to produce exploits you see the power of
[1:22:02] recognizing I believe that's what Daniel
[1:22:04] was talking about a people that know
[1:22:07] their God recognize their God identify
[1:22:11] their God identify what's going on then
[1:22:14] they can do exploits and that's what I
[1:22:17] love about this message it is the
[1:22:19] mystery of God revealed it's no longer
[1:22:22] the blind leading the blind but there's
[1:22:24] an understanding in this generation and
[1:22:27] that's what I love about it where the
[1:22:28] Brandon would tell us the revelation of
[1:22:31] God is what gives the authority over the
[1:22:34] devil and so the people that know their
[1:22:36] God get a revelation of their God then
[1:22:39] will overcome the enemy oh my but you
[1:22:42] see brother random would say through the
[1:22:44] church ages no one should have looked
[1:22:47] back and says man I wish I was with the
[1:22:49] apostles he says no one should have
[1:22:52] looked back wanted to be there he says
[1:22:54] this here and and think of it not one
[1:22:56] believer of any age should have a cry in
[1:22:59] his heart oh I might have been back
[1:23:01] there in the first stage when the
[1:23:03] apostles were sent out there was no need
[1:23:06] to look back look up he says Behold Him
[1:23:10] who is even now walking in the midst of
[1:23:13] the churches through all of the ages he
[1:23:16] says Behold Him who was the same
[1:23:18] yesterday today and forever and who
[1:23:21] never change either in essence or in his
[1:23:24] ways where two or three are gathered
[1:23:27] together in his name there he is in
[1:23:29] their midst not only in their midst as a
[1:23:32] as a complacent onlooker or as a
[1:23:34] recording Angel but he stands there
[1:23:37] expressing exactly what he is he says
[1:23:41] there's no need to look back look up
[1:23:44] there's no need to look back and say man
[1:23:46] I wish I was back there he says look up
[1:23:49] and recognize that he is still walking
[1:23:51] in the midst of of the church ages the
[1:23:54] same God the start of the church is the
[1:23:56] same God that is going to complete the
[1:23:59] church and I like how brother brandom
[1:24:01] says that behold he is the same
[1:24:03] yesterday today and forever behold look
[1:24:06] up Behold Him who is even now walking in
[1:24:09] the midst of the church ages and the
[1:24:11] word behold means to look and that just
[1:24:14] struck me as I was reading that this
[1:24:15] morning the word behold is to look look
[1:24:18] behold look him who is even now walking
[1:24:21] in the mid of the churches and the Bible
[1:24:24] would say in John 1:29 Behold the Lamb
[1:24:27] of God which taketh away the sin of the
[1:24:29] world John was proclaiming look we're
[1:24:32] not waiting any longer but recognize
[1:24:35] here he is the Lamb of God who is to
[1:24:38] take away the sins of the world
[1:24:41] recognize him what's Malachi 4:5 say
[1:24:44] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:24:47] look I'm sending you a message I'm
[1:24:50] sending you a prophet I'm sending you a
[1:24:52] visitation for your generation look
[1:24:57] behold look recognize what I'm doing I'm
[1:25:00] sending a word that is going to turn
[1:25:02] your hearts back to the original fathers
[1:25:05] to produce the original exploits you
[1:25:08] just got to look look turn your faith
[1:25:11] back recognize what I'm doing I'm
[1:25:14] walking even now in the midst of the
[1:25:16] candlesticks and brother brandom quotes
[1:25:18] that scripture who walketh in the who
[1:25:20] who walketh in the midst of the candle s
[1:25:22] and he says how meaningful are those
[1:25:25] words when viewed in the light of the
[1:25:28] scripture he says
[1:25:30] this he says those words were viewed in
[1:25:33] the light of the scripture who describes
[1:25:35] him as Christ who is our life for Christ
[1:25:38] indeed he the life of the church she has
[1:25:41] no other life without him she is simply
[1:25:45] a religious Society a club a meaningless
[1:25:48] Gathering of the people a corpse bewi
[1:25:50] and dressed is still a corpse so the
[1:25:53] church no matter what her programs and
[1:25:56] her gracious efforts might achieve
[1:25:58] without Christ she is a corpse also but
[1:26:01] with him in her midst with him
[1:26:04] motivating her she becomes to the
[1:26:06] wonderment of all of his body the
[1:26:08] fullness of him that filth all in all
[1:26:11] and this very hour he is walking in the
[1:26:14] midst of the last Age golden Candlestick
[1:26:17] what he was what what he was when he
[1:26:19] walked in the first stage he is even now
[1:26:22] in the last age Jesus the same yesterday
[1:26:26] today and forever amen how meaningful
[1:26:31] are those words when viewed in the light
[1:26:33] of the scripture that just struck me
[1:26:36] when viewed in the light of the
[1:26:38] scripture what is the light of the
[1:26:39] scripture this word this message a shine
[1:26:42] to light upon the scripture so once you
[1:26:45] look at it through the light of the
[1:26:47] scripture then you recognize him as our
[1:26:50] life you don't Rec we're not just a a
[1:26:53] useless Gathering we're not just some
[1:26:55] some Society but we've got the Life of
[1:26:58] Christ on the inside we've recognized
[1:27:01] him and now that's put us in a position
[1:27:04] to do exploits you see the exploits of
[1:27:07] faith hope this is okay this morning
[1:27:10] it's going to come by understanding who
[1:27:12] God is not a god of yesterday but a god
[1:27:15] of today not in not a God in a in a in a
[1:27:18] body of Flesh 2,000 years ago but a God
[1:27:21] in a body of Flesh today you see the
[1:27:24] Bible would tell us that the mystery of
[1:27:26] God should be finished and I believe the
[1:27:29] understanding of who God is has been
[1:27:31] poured out on this generation and I like
[1:27:33] how how dad put it uh a few months back
[1:27:36] I think he says that John puted the
[1:27:38] mystery of God should be finished he
[1:27:41] says it's finished to the bride but it's
[1:27:43] not finished to the church World it
[1:27:45] should be finished but it's still a
[1:27:47] mystery oh my let us not be thy way
[1:27:50] looking up the word and it's still a
[1:27:53] mystery oh Hallelujah but it's a special
[1:27:56] class of people that is going to see the
[1:27:59] mystery brother Brandon would say you
[1:28:01] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:28:03] of this message that this book we are
[1:28:05] studying is actually the revelation of
[1:28:08] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[1:28:11] in future ages then then I mention that
[1:28:13] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:28:16] Revelation or we fail to get it bringing
[1:28:19] those two thoughts together you will see
[1:28:21] it it won't take just ordinary study and
[1:28:25] thinking to make this book real it's
[1:28:27] going to take the operation of the Holy
[1:28:30] Ghost oh my so it's not just reading and
[1:28:33] listening it's having the Holy Ghost
[1:28:36] reveal it then once it reveals it we
[1:28:38] identify it and it puts it into action
[1:28:41] he says this book can't be revealed to
[1:28:43] anyone but a special class of people it
[1:28:47] will take one with prophetic insight and
[1:28:50] I say Lord that's me I'm the people with
[1:28:53] prophetic Insight that can look and see
[1:28:56] what God is doing you know brother
[1:28:57] brandom says prophetic insight has been
[1:29:00] swapped with a bunch of Creeds but he
[1:29:02] says there is still a prophetic class of
[1:29:04] people we're not swapping the word with
[1:29:06] Creeds we've identify the word and have
[1:29:09] embraced the word so that we can live
[1:29:11] the word and he says it will it will
[1:29:13] require the ability to hear from God oh
[1:29:17] my it will require the ability to hear
[1:29:21] from God you know what that means we got
[1:29:23] to unclog some
[1:29:24] channels we got to unclog the channels
[1:29:27] we got to get things out of all that and
[1:29:29] that's what I was saying earlier about
[1:29:31] justifying Spirits if you justify
[1:29:33] Spirits it clogs the channel and then
[1:29:36] brother the Brandon is saying the only
[1:29:37] way to get a revelation is the ability
[1:29:40] to hear from God oh my let us let's
[1:29:43] let's make a dedication this morning
[1:29:45] Lord I'm unclogging the channels if I
[1:29:47] need to throw Spirits out I'm going to
[1:29:49] throw them out if I need to get things
[1:29:51] out of my life I'm going to get them out
[1:29:53] if I need to burn things in my home I'm
[1:29:55] going to burn things in my home because
[1:29:57] I'm that I'm the people that you're
[1:29:58] talking about I want to know you God I
[1:30:01] want to know my God but first we got to
[1:30:04] have the ability to hear from God Amen
[1:30:06] it will require Supernatural instruction
[1:30:09] not just a student comparing verse to
[1:30:11] verse though that is good but a mystery
[1:30:14] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:30:17] it never becomes clear oh it requires
[1:30:20] the teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:30:23] becomes clear how do we hear from God
[1:30:26] and lay ourselves how do we how do we
[1:30:28] how do we hear from God and lay
[1:30:29] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:30:32] spirit to hear and know oh how we need
[1:30:34] to hear from God pardon me how we need
[1:30:37] to hear from God and lay ourselves open
[1:30:40] and become yielded to the spirit and
[1:30:42] hear to know all right how to become
[1:30:45] yielded and you know I talked some on uh
[1:30:48] on humility last time and this scripture
[1:30:51] I've been preaching out of a lot lately
[1:30:53] and this really struck Me 2 Chronicles
[1:30:55] 7:14 If my people which are called by my
[1:30:59] name shall humble themselves my people
[1:31:02] humility is a hard thing that's guys can
[1:31:05] testify of that to humble yourself and
[1:31:08] say I'm sorry to humble yourself and say
[1:31:10] I was wrong to humble oursel and say you
[1:31:13] know that action was wrong I did this
[1:31:15] wrong it's a hard thing but he's saying
[1:31:18] my people has the ability to Humble
[1:31:20] themselves if my people he didn't say if
[1:31:23] anybody will humble themselves I will
[1:31:25] come and heal their land but he says if
[1:31:28] my people which are called by my name if
[1:31:31] my people who's called by grace shall
[1:31:34] humble themselves and pray seek my face
[1:31:36] turn from their Wicked Ways then I will
[1:31:38] hear from Heaven oh I want God to hear
[1:31:41] my prayers I want God to come and he I
[1:31:43] request for my family I want God to hear
[1:31:46] me but first it's going to take
[1:31:48] humility come on now it's going to take
[1:31:50] somebody to Humble them himself and say
[1:31:53] Lord the direction I'm going is not the
[1:31:55] right way the spirits I'm entertaining
[1:31:58] is not the right way what I'm justifying
[1:32:00] in my life is not the right way I'm
[1:32:03] willing to humble myself you see brother
[1:32:05] Brandon would say therefore God reveals
[1:32:07] not to the world not to the
[1:32:09] psychologists not to the educated
[1:32:11] ministers but to the humble in heart his
[1:32:14] people who is Meek he will reveal the
[1:32:17] secrets of the great things of God to
[1:32:19] them he says you see it the secrets of
[1:32:22] the great things of God the mystery of
[1:32:25] God has been revealed but he's only
[1:32:27] going to reveal it to the people who are
[1:32:29] humbled in heart humble in heart not the
[1:32:31] psychologist not the educated ministers
[1:32:34] but somebody that is humble to the word
[1:32:36] of God you look at Daniel Daniel 1 and8
[1:32:39] but Dave Daniel purposed in his heart
[1:32:41] that he would not defile himself with
[1:32:43] the portion of King's meat nor the wine
[1:32:46] which he drank therefore he requested of
[1:32:48] the prince of the Unix that he might if
[1:32:50] might not def file himself so we see it
[1:32:54] starts out this is the first chapter of
[1:32:56] Daniel this is when he's just a boy and
[1:32:58] he's there in Babylon I believe and this
[1:33:00] is something we can as young people can
[1:33:02] take to heart the first thing Daniel
[1:33:04] done was purposed in his heart then what
[1:33:07] happens the next verse Daniel 1:9 now
[1:33:09] God brought favor brought Daniel into
[1:33:12] favor oh my you want the favor of God
[1:33:14] purpose your heart you in favor with God
[1:33:17] humble yourself and we see the Bible
[1:33:20] would saying Daniel one 15 and at the
[1:33:22] end of 10 days their countenance
[1:33:25] appeared fairer and fatter in flesh oh
[1:33:29] my that just th stood out to me as fear
[1:33:32] appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than
[1:33:34] all the children which did eat the
[1:33:36] portion of the king's meat so once he
[1:33:39] purposed his heart God brought him favor
[1:33:42] and then he's performing exploits all
[1:33:44] right now when his flesh is producing
[1:33:47] the power of God that none of the other
[1:33:49] children had oh my you want to stand out
[1:33:53] in the midst of drugs purpose your heart
[1:33:55] you want to stand out in the midst of
[1:33:57] Gossip purpose your heart you want to
[1:33:59] stand out in the midst of of
[1:34:01] criticalness purpose your heart and
[1:34:04] watch God Elevate you above all the rest
[1:34:07] of the children you may see what do you
[1:34:09] mean Elevate watch the power of God the
[1:34:11] supernatural God work through a young
[1:34:14] person work through a mama work through
[1:34:16] a daddy but first it's got to be a
[1:34:18] purposed heart the Bible would say in
[1:34:20] Matthew 12 35 a good man out of the good
[1:34:23] Treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[1:34:26] good things and an evil man out of the
[1:34:28] evil treasure bringing forth evil things
[1:34:31] so it all starts with the purpose heart
[1:34:33] a humble heart saying Lord I'm getting
[1:34:36] the evil things out so that you can
[1:34:39] reveal the secrets so you can reveal the
[1:34:41] secrets and perform exploits the only
[1:34:44] way I'm going to know God is to
[1:34:46] understand God the understanding of God
[1:34:48] has been poured out and he says brother
[1:34:50] brandom says now he has CED out in this
[1:34:52] last stage you have the word you have
[1:34:54] more Bibles than ever but you're not
[1:34:56] doing anything about the word except
[1:34:59] dividing it hacking it into pieces
[1:35:01] taking what you want leaving out what
[1:35:03] you don't want you are not interested in
[1:35:05] living it he's talking about the church
[1:35:07] World they've got the word but they're
[1:35:09] just dividing it they're just fighting
[1:35:12] with it the only thing the message is to
[1:35:14] many people is an argument but nobody's
[1:35:16] willing to love that nobody's interested
[1:35:18] in living it oh my God don't wants
[1:35:21] people that have had knowledge he wants
[1:35:23] somebody that's living it come on now he
[1:35:25] don't want somebody that can go through
[1:35:26] all the seals go through all the all of
[1:35:29] the the the adoption series and can
[1:35:31] quote it and quote it and quote it but
[1:35:32] not willing to live it I say Lord let me
[1:35:35] learn it and live it not just a head
[1:35:37] knowledge but let me live it let me
[1:35:39] purpose in my heart to take what I'm
[1:35:42] learning and put it into action oh
[1:35:45] Hallelujah but once Daniel purposed his
[1:35:47] heart it started through his flesh God
[1:35:50] Favored here and brother brandom says
[1:35:52] and today friend the only way we can
[1:35:55] ever have favor with God God is rich in
[1:35:57] Mercy today but we've got to respect
[1:36:00] what he said about it you just can't
[1:36:02] take what somebody else said you've got
[1:36:04] to take what God Said let every man's
[1:36:06] word be a lie and mine true we've got to
[1:36:09] respect what he said about it amen I
[1:36:12] know I've slowed down a little bit at
[1:36:14] this at this end here but just bear with
[1:36:17] me we got to respect what God says about
[1:36:20] it because it's the favor that can bring
[1:36:22] exploits it's only the favor of God that
[1:36:25] can bring exploits it's the favor of God
[1:36:27] that that has brought you this far it
[1:36:29] was the favor of God that brought life
[1:36:31] of God through Mary you look at Luke 1
[1:36:34] and 128 and the angel come unto her and
[1:36:37] said hell thou are Thou Art highly
[1:36:39] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[1:36:41] art thou among women you're highly
[1:36:44] favored a message come to Mary saying
[1:36:46] you're favored there's many virgins
[1:36:49] there's many women but you're blessed
[1:36:52] God has chose to give you his favor and
[1:36:55] what happened what does she said be it
[1:36:56] unto me according to Thy word she was
[1:36:59] favored but she still had a purpose in
[1:37:01] her heart oh my we're favored people on
[1:37:04] Earth today not anybody had a prophet
[1:37:07] not anybody had a message but God come
[1:37:09] to you and says you're favored if you're
[1:37:11] willing the purpose in your heart you
[1:37:14] look at Genesis 29 and 17 Leo was
[1:37:17] tendered eyed but Rachel was beautiful
[1:37:19] and well favored say Rachel was the one
[1:37:22] Jacob chose he expressed his favor to
[1:37:25] Rachel yeah and you know what that just
[1:37:27] that just that just that that really
[1:37:29] spoke to my heart Rachel couldn't have
[1:37:32] any children for a long time I believe
[1:37:33] Leah could but since she was chosen she
[1:37:36] was still favorite oh my you might look
[1:37:39] and say well that one's smarter I'm not
[1:37:41] smart I don't got an education I'm a
[1:37:43] nobody I don't got money I don't got a
[1:37:45] nice house I don't got nice cars but
[1:37:48] you're favorite God chose you by Grace
[1:37:52] God chose you by election and put his
[1:37:55] favor upon you but you see the bride
[1:37:58] hasn't got favor just to Puff you up but
[1:38:00] the favor of God is to fulfill the
[1:38:02] purpose Romans 9:11 for the children
[1:38:05] being not yet born neither having done
[1:38:07] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:38:10] according to election might stand not of
[1:38:13] works but of him that calleth it was
[1:38:16] said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:38:18] younger as it is written Jacob have
[1:38:21] loved but Esau have I hated the children
[1:38:24] not yet being born neither having done
[1:38:26] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:38:30] according to election might stand amen
[1:38:33] because of election he favored Jacob oh
[1:38:36] my because of election he's favored you
[1:38:39] not to Puff you up so that the purpose
[1:38:41] can be fulfilled you see election is a
[1:38:44] powerful thing if you're included in the
[1:38:46] purpose of God you've got the favor of
[1:38:48] God in your life have you ever wondered
[1:38:51] haha why you're not in a premature grave
[1:38:53] it's the purpose of God the favor of God
[1:38:55] have you ever wondered why you're not in
[1:38:57] an insane institution it's the favor of
[1:39:00] God have you ever wondered why you guys
[1:39:02] in an addiction still it's the favor of
[1:39:04] God have you ever wondered why you come
[1:39:06] out of broken homes and your marriages
[1:39:09] together still it's the favor of God
[1:39:11] don't ever take that for granted the
[1:39:13] favor of God is fulfilling the purpose
[1:39:16] yeah but you see could you imagine being
[1:39:18] the woman of the well she wasn't the
[1:39:20] only prostitute
[1:39:21] Ju Just just think about this for a
[1:39:23] second I was think I was pondering on
[1:39:25] this last night the woman at the well
[1:39:27] wasn't the only prostitute I'm sure she
[1:39:29] wasn't the only one that was wrecking
[1:39:30] homes but she was the only one that was
[1:39:32] favored and Jesus would say I have means
[1:39:36] to go by
[1:39:37] Samaria that favor in her heart brought
[1:39:39] Christ to her well she wasn't even
[1:39:42] allowed to be with the rest of the woman
[1:39:44] she wasn't even allowed to be with the
[1:39:45] man because of her past she wasn't the
[1:39:48] only one with the past but she was
[1:39:50] favored oh little church you might have
[1:39:52] a past that that is a mile long you
[1:39:55] might have scars you might have hurts
[1:39:57] you might you might have things you're
[1:39:58] not proud of but you're favored you're
[1:40:00] not the only one brother Joe that was in
[1:40:02] drugs sister Stephanie that was in
[1:40:04] addictions but you was favored and since
[1:40:07] you were favored God sent his grace oh
[1:40:10] Hallelujah since we're favored in this
[1:40:12] generation he didn't go and meet that
[1:40:14] the smarts but he come to the ones that
[1:40:16] he
[1:40:17] favored and it always amazes me that the
[1:40:20] Bible says
[1:40:21] that after that that that Jesus spoke to
[1:40:23] the woman at the well the Bible says in
[1:40:26] in John 4:28 then the woman left her
[1:40:29] water pot and ran into the City and
[1:40:31] saith unto the men have you ever thought
[1:40:33] about that she ran to the people that
[1:40:36] she wasn't even supposed to be with she
[1:40:38] was an outcast she was a leop to the men
[1:40:41] she was a woman of ill Fame and so
[1:40:43] anytime you see her coming you're around
[1:40:45] the opposite direction but those are the
[1:40:47] ones she ran to right and you know
[1:40:49] what's so incredible about it the men
[1:40:51] listen to her amen could you imagine
[1:40:54] that the men of the city that was
[1:40:56] shuning her is now listening to a
[1:40:58] prostitute because the Bible says she
[1:41:00] ran to the men of the sea men of the
[1:41:02] city saying come see a man that has told
[1:41:04] me all that I ever done and the Bible
[1:41:06] says and they went and Found Jesus all
[1:41:08] right what was it it was exploits these
[1:41:11] men seen a change they looked and says
[1:41:14] my this ain't the same woman that we
[1:41:16] were shunning come on oh Hallelujah this
[1:41:19] ain't the same woman that was a
[1:41:21] prostitute this ain't the same woman
[1:41:23] that has five husbands there's something
[1:41:26] happening in her life she met God the
[1:41:30] favor of God led her to the reality of
[1:41:33] God which changed her life and produced
[1:41:36] in her flesh exploits that the men of
[1:41:39] the city said man but brother brandom
[1:41:42] says the men of the city believed on
[1:41:44] Jesus because the report of the woman my
[1:41:48] goodness they wasn't even allowed to be
[1:41:50] around her but the exploits was so
[1:41:52] convincing and oh my let the exploits in
[1:41:54] my flesh be so convincing to the world
[1:41:58] that they see a change that's not Joe
[1:42:00] that stole cars that's not Joe that done
[1:42:02] this there's something different about
[1:42:04] him this ain't William that used to cuss
[1:42:06] that used to dance that ain't the same
[1:42:08] William there's exploits that ain't the
[1:42:10] same Mike King that ain't the same
[1:42:12] sister Carol that ain't the same John
[1:42:14] tance there's something different what
[1:42:17] happened there's exploits somebody's
[1:42:19] coming contact with their God they've
[1:42:22] come face to face and it changed in
[1:42:25] their flesh into exploits oh Hallelujah
[1:42:29] let my flesh be exploits bless the Lord
[1:42:32] bless the Lord John 4:29 come see a man
[1:42:35] which had told me all the things that
[1:42:37] that I ever done is this not the Christ
[1:42:40] then they went out into the City and
[1:42:41] came unto him they realized something
[1:42:44] took place look up the man that set at
[1:42:46] the pool of Bethesda brother the brandom
[1:42:48] says there was worse cases than this man
[1:42:50] but random says he wasn't lame he could
[1:42:52] walk he could move around he was just
[1:42:55] weary and the Bible says the lame was
[1:42:57] there the Hal was there the death was
[1:42:59] there the Dome was there all of these
[1:43:02] other people were there but the favor of
[1:43:04] God was with this individual and could
[1:43:07] you imagine Jesus walking by a leper
[1:43:09] walking by a crippled person walking by
[1:43:12] a a blind person to come to a man that
[1:43:14] could walk what made the difference the
[1:43:17] favor of God oh my hope hope you're
[1:43:20] listening to me this morning maybe
[1:43:22] there's a lot better people that God
[1:43:23] could have chose but he chose you maybe
[1:43:26] there's a lot more people he could have
[1:43:28] showed his compassion too but he chose
[1:43:30] you and brother brandham says a man full
[1:43:33] of compassion passed by all of them but
[1:43:36] he says many people think compassion is
[1:43:39] human sympathy but he says it ain't
[1:43:41] human sympathy compassion is the will of
[1:43:43] the
[1:43:44] father oh the will of a father come to a
[1:43:47] man with favor and produced exploits oh
[1:43:51] that's why this message has come to you
[1:43:53] cuz he needed the people the will of the
[1:43:55] father and the favor of God brought you
[1:43:58] together oh Hallelujah brought a message
[1:44:01] in this generation so that there can be
[1:44:04] favor to understand what God is doing in
[1:44:07] this generation give me a few more
[1:44:09] minutes and I'll bring this down to a
[1:44:11] close but the favor of God has brought
[1:44:13] us something in this generation but you
[1:44:16] have to realize that's your favorite you
[1:44:18] got to realize if you never realize your
[1:44:20] fav you're never going to make this
[1:44:22] message yours you see without making
[1:44:24] this message yours you're never going to
[1:44:26] realize your identity of it you see I I
[1:44:28] heard a story I think Grandpa told a
[1:44:30] story before actually he says there was
[1:44:32] a man typ rope tight roping across nagar
[1:44:34] Falls I'm sure many of us heard the
[1:44:36] story and he said and he asked the
[1:44:38] people do you think I can walk across
[1:44:39] Niger Falls and they said oh yes you can
[1:44:41] do it he walks across and comes back he
[1:44:44] says you think I can take this
[1:44:45] wheelbarrow across the Rope they said
[1:44:47] yes sir you can do it he grabbed the
[1:44:49] wheelbarrow took it across brought it
[1:44:51] back and I and I and I googled to see if
[1:44:52] it was true and it was and they said he
[1:44:55] grabbed the stove he grabbed the stove
[1:44:57] and was cooking eggs while walking
[1:44:59] across that rope and then he grabs the W
[1:45:01] barrel and ask the people do y'all think
[1:45:03] I can take an individual a person in
[1:45:06] this wh Barrel across this roping back
[1:45:08] they all said yes sir he says okay get
[1:45:10] in and they all stopped and said oh I
[1:45:12] don't know about that brother brandom
[1:45:14] talks about a pastor and he says a
[1:45:16] pastor got his congregation together and
[1:45:18] says you think I can pick up this log

[1:45:38] different when you're included in it
[1:45:40] yourself oh it's different when you're
[1:45:43] included in it yourself he says see
[1:45:45] That's mighty good for us here to say

[1:45:49] believe that's true but then put it into
[1:45:51] action you've got to put it into action

[1:46:05] message for yourself and make it your
[1:46:07] absolute come on now if you can't make
[1:46:09] it your absolute you haven't seen it you
[1:46:11] haven't identified it as Christ yet but
[1:46:14] what you identified as Christ it becomes
[1:46:16] your absolute and you're jumping in it
[1:46:19] you're jumping in the world Bill s Lord
[1:46:20] take me wherever this message is going
[1:46:22] I'm going with it wherever this message
[1:46:24] leads me it's guiding me where I'm if
[1:46:26] it's a Rapture I'm going with it if it's
[1:46:28] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:46:30] death I'm going with it I've identified
[1:46:32] it as God in this
[1:46:35] generation oh my I've I've identified it
[1:46:39] because this message has brought our
[1:46:41] identity to us brother brand said no
[1:46:43] I've only thought I've thought of why
[1:46:46] don't the people come and listen and why
[1:46:48] don't they come and accept it but of
[1:46:50] course I know I know that you said they
[1:46:52] wouldn't they so they won't he's praying
[1:46:55] a prayer I know you said he he's praying
[1:46:57] to the Lord that you you said they
[1:46:59] wouldn't so they won't but there were
[1:47:00] some that's got their names written on
[1:47:02] the Lamb's Book of Life and when the
[1:47:04] seals are thrown open there they see
[1:47:06] their name and the Holy Ghost speaks to
[1:47:08] them they come oh my can you testify of
[1:47:12] that that when these seals were loose
[1:47:14] and you seen the message something spoke
[1:47:16] your name and they say my that's my
[1:47:18] identity as the musician has come this
[1:47:20] morning that's my identity the identity
[1:47:24] that you had before the fall is what
[1:47:26] this message has restored I know if I've
[1:47:28] talked about Lazarus many times but you
[1:47:30] ever thought about Lazarus before he was
[1:47:32] ever in the Tomb he had a house before
[1:47:35] he was ever in the Tomb he had he had
[1:47:37] money before he was ever in the Tomb he
[1:47:39] had sisters but once he went in the Tomb
[1:47:42] he lost all that he lost his identity it
[1:47:45] was no longer his but then the Bible
[1:47:47] says Christ went to the tomb and cried
[1:47:50] with a loud voice a loud voice of the
[1:47:53] voice of Resurrection a voice a message
[1:47:56] brought back his identity and you know
[1:47:58] if you read that if you read the
[1:47:59] scripture the Bible says they kept
[1:48:01] calling him dead they said the the the
[1:48:04] brother that was with the Dead the one
[1:48:06] that was with the dead remove the remove
[1:48:08] the stone that was covering the dead his
[1:48:11] identity was dead but before the dead
[1:48:13] identity he had an identity but he just
[1:48:16] needed the voice to restore that
[1:48:19] identity amen oh Hallelujah and before
[1:48:22] the foundation of the world in the mind
[1:48:24] of God your identity was the people your
[1:48:27] identity was the bride of Christ your
[1:48:30] identity was a people with exploits but
[1:48:33] you needed a voice oh Hallelujah you
[1:48:36] needed the voice to bring back your
[1:48:38] identity you wasn't a blasphemer you
[1:48:41] were the bride of Christ you wasn't a
[1:48:43] liar you're the bride of Christ oh
[1:48:45] you're not an adulterer you're the bride
[1:48:47] of Christ you're not an addict you're
[1:48:49] the Bride of Christ but we needed a
[1:48:51] voice to bring back our identity that we
[1:48:55] can stand and say that's mine this word
[1:48:58] is mine and could you imagine Lazarus

[2:05:37] your
[2:05:42] Hallelujah I think that was a very
[2:05:44] important message here this
[2:05:47] morning
[2:05:49] were
[2:05:52] favored not because of
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:56] our own works or
[2:05:59] our our smarts were favored because we
[2:06:02] were in his mind and on his
[2:06:06] book before the world ever even
[2:06:11] began but what we do with this favor
[2:06:16] is is quite important
[2:06:20] how we respond to that favor is is quite
[2:06:28] important I think that if
[2:06:32] there's anything that we should want is
[2:06:36] is the blessings of the Lord upon
[2:06:39] us we want to be in his perfect
[2:06:44] will and if there's any time that we
[2:06:48] ever really need to really so
[2:06:52] search why why do things come so many
[2:06:56] times many times bitterness comes
[2:07:00] or lots of times we're trying to
[2:07:04] put a a a a a square Block in a round
[2:07:08] hole
[2:07:10] and you get angry at God get angry at
[2:07:13] everyone else you get well lots of times
[2:07:16] we just need to look Inward and say Lord
[2:07:17] where am I at what what where am I
[2:07:23] at cuz I if I'm in your will I I I'm
[2:07:28] content I want your
[2:07:30] blessings and so we want that kind of a
[2:07:33] heart saying
[2:07:35] Lord I want you to use me I want your
[2:07:38] gift to be so manifest through
[2:07:42] me and if there's anything that's
[2:07:44] hindering it help me amen
[2:07:50] and
[2:07:53] um
[2:07:55] I Sister Mary had had sent a had had
[2:08:00] posted a little a deal and I I think I
[2:08:03] put it on the on the on the church uh
[2:08:07] page the other day that said
[2:08:10] tonight this this was something that she
[2:08:14] had
[2:08:14] seen and she just passed it along but it
[2:08:17] says tonight during the message my
[2:08:20] 9-year-old son Jay come to the
[2:08:23] realization that the children who were
[2:08:26] not on the ark didn't make
[2:08:28] it he looked to me with a with such a
[2:08:31] sad questioning face all I could say was
[2:08:35] their parents didn't make sure that they
[2:08:37] were on the
[2:08:40] ark the weight of that statement is
[2:08:42] still Weighing on me of all things I
[2:08:45] could do for the kingdom of God nothing
[2:08:48] is more more important than making sure
[2:08:49] that my children find their way to a
[2:08:53] relationship with
[2:08:55] Jesus I as I read that I pondered on
[2:09:00] that myself
[2:09:02] because there was nothing more important
[2:09:05] nothing more important no
[2:09:07] family uh Heritage no no
[2:09:12] no family characteristics no nothing but
[2:09:17] the power of the Holy Spirit making sure
[2:09:20] that our children are filled with the
[2:09:22] Holy
[2:09:24] Ghost and I I just I just wrote a little
[2:09:28] text for my family and I thought as Josh
[2:09:34] was preaching this morning I thought I
[2:09:36] would go ahead
[2:09:37] and and and just read it to
[2:09:41] you and I had on here praying for my
[2:09:44] family today and you can be seated if
[2:09:45] you want to for a
[2:09:47] moment says this morning I read as I
[2:09:51] read sister Mary's post about all the
[2:09:53] kids who missed the safety of the
[2:09:55] Ark because the masas and daddies didn't
[2:09:58] feel the urgency of the hour and hence
[2:10:00] did not get them on the
[2:10:03] ark one of the most sobering facts that
[2:10:06] there
[2:10:07] is is that this family is not exip
[2:10:12] exempt from a supernatural
[2:10:15] enemy whose aim is to use pain and pl
[2:10:18] pleasure to make us blind stupid
[2:10:22] miserable unproductive in our
[2:10:25] purpose we know this enemy as the devil
[2:10:28] and Satan the deceiver of the whole
[2:10:30] world the accuser Revelations 129 the
[2:10:35] prince of this world John
[2:10:37] 12:31 the God of this evil Age 2
[2:10:40] Corinthians
[2:10:41] 4:4 please family please listen to me
[2:10:46] the devil is real and he is our
[2:10:49] adversary who prows around like a
[2:10:52] roaring lion seeking someone to devour
[2:10:55] first Peter 5 and
[2:10:57] 8 yet in the most appalling and
[2:10:59] unwitting witting band bondage the whole
[2:11:02] world willingly follows the
[2:11:04] prince of the power of the air the
[2:11:08] spirit that is now at work in the sons
[2:11:11] of
[2:11:13] Disobedience now Satan's
[2:11:17] subjects march obliviously to
[2:11:19] destruction and they are going to take
[2:11:21] as many as they can but it is so sad to
[2:11:25] see so many believers who are
[2:11:27] unwittingly marching to the same
[2:11:30] tune but listen family we know Satan's
[2:11:34] tactics and we must stand guard against
[2:11:38] him think about it every sin imaginable
[2:11:42] is at the reach of our
[2:11:43] fingers temptation is always with us and
[2:11:47] all around us 24 hours a day 7 days a
[2:11:52] week never before has the temptation of
[2:11:55] evil been so present as now it is with
[2:11:58] us in our bedrooms bathrooms cars jobs
[2:12:03] pray meetings church services devotions
[2:12:06] Bible studies in the form of
[2:12:09] phones yes computers phones and internet
[2:12:12] can be a tool of absolute
[2:12:14] destruction tens of thousands of
[2:12:16] marriages have been mutilated and
[2:12:18] destroyed by Spirits coming through that
[2:12:21] internet Untold numbers of CH of kids
[2:12:25] who are addicted to gaming and social
[2:12:27] media or also heavily addicted to
[2:12:31] pornography evil spirits attached itself
[2:12:34] to the child while innocently playing
[2:12:37] games these evil spirits are released
[2:12:39] and transmitted into the spirits of
[2:12:41] young boys and unwitting
[2:12:44] men and these days
[2:12:46] girls who see nothing wrong with gaming
[2:12:49] watching movies browsing internet
[2:12:52] sites they can handle it they're big
[2:12:55] boys yet the statistics show otherwise
[2:12:59] hundreds of thousands of adulteries
[2:13:01] rapes and
[2:13:03] murders have been indirect results of
[2:13:06] the internet these unscrupulous
[2:13:08] individuals have danced with the devil
[2:13:11] when alone behind closed doors of a
[2:13:14] bedroom
[2:13:15] bathroom vehicle
[2:13:18] and these Spirits took form in their
[2:13:21] hearts minds and
[2:13:24] bodies and they becomes ens snared and
[2:13:28] imprisoned by
[2:13:29] Satan that's why I think we need to
[2:13:31] really monitor the use of our phones and
[2:13:34] not let it be the go-to for everything
[2:13:36] in life phones in themselves are
[2:13:39] harmless communication through text and
[2:13:41] phone calls are
[2:13:42] harmless but remember the time spent on
[2:13:45] our phones take away from what is
[2:13:46] currently happening around us in our
[2:13:49] homes jobs and families think about all
[2:13:51] the needless information we are putting
[2:13:53] in our Spirits Minds through Facebook
[2:13:57] gaming YouTube videos other internet
[2:14:01] use guys we must be smart and understand
[2:14:05] Satan's strategy Satan is not dumb and
[2:14:09] neither are we I promise this is a
[2:14:12] tactic of the devil and there is no way
[2:14:15] to overcome with junks with junk in our
[2:14:19] spirits and and then I put the scripture
[2:14:23] there in 2 Corinthian or yeah second
[2:14:25] Corinthians 2:11 the NIV that we would
[2:14:28] not be outwitted by Satan for we are not
[2:14:32] ignorant of his
[2:14:36] designs as we as as we think about this
[2:14:40] stretch that we're
[2:14:42] on I think we need to really as families
[2:14:46] we need to really we need need to really
[2:14:48] consider this is our in in our
[2:14:52] lives because
[2:14:55] Satan wants to take this last
[2:14:58] generation and he also wants to clog up
[2:15:01] our
[2:15:02] Spirits as men and
[2:15:05] women and I know he can do it in a lot
[2:15:08] of different
[2:15:11] ways but most any anyone today that is
[2:15:14] fighting battles that is that are
[2:15:16] struggling with their prayer life life
[2:15:18] that are struggling with their
[2:15:21] devotions are people that are
[2:15:23] spending most most everything is because
[2:15:27] we are putting too much time right here
[2:15:30] on these
[2:15:34] devices used to we had family games we'd
[2:15:38] all sit together around a table we'd
[2:15:39] play checkers or
[2:15:42] skip but these days everyone's got their
[2:15:44] phone families don't matter
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:51] and I would dare say
[2:15:54] that matters of fact I I have been told
[2:15:58] Brother Wendell there's there's some of
[2:16:00] the young kids kid kids that's on the
[2:16:04] internet at late at
[2:16:07] night 1 and 2:00 in the
[2:16:09] [Music]
[2:16:15] morning it's not of our business but the
[2:16:17] maybe we ought to tell
[2:16:21] you really what are we what what what
[2:16:25] are we what are we teaching these these
[2:16:28] youngans
[2:16:33] what's I
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:38] say that it won't ever it's it's it it
[2:16:41] it's going to happen it does happen but
[2:16:43] it won't be because I haven't screamed
[2:16:45] out against
[2:16:46] it
[2:16:49] I've screamed out against that stuff for
[2:16:53] years my children my
[2:16:55] grandchildren you
[2:16:57] know
[2:17:00] whatever but it ain't going to be
[2:17:01] because I haven't put it out
[2:17:06] there I think we need to be very
[2:17:11] wise your children your grandchildren it
[2:17:15] ain't because I haven't put it out there
[2:17:16] as pastor as the Watchman on the

[2:17:26] these kinds of things
[2:17:28] as brother Wendell's just o
[2:17:31] fogy this ain't no
[2:17:33] fogy this is a trick of the devil in
[2:17:36] this last day to keep your
[2:17:39] mind away from the power and when he hit
[2:17:43] that this morning on clogged up clogged
[2:17:45] up got bitterness you got and the reason
[2:17:47] why we're bitter and the reason why
[2:17:49] we're is because we're not fulfilling
[2:17:51] people that's not fulfilling the purpose
[2:17:53] that God put them here oh they they they
[2:17:56] wanted they want to do their own thing
[2:17:58] and they want and they want God to bless
[2:18:00] that but the thing is is is is there's
[2:18:05] you've got a specific purpose and you
[2:18:08] want that anointing of the Holy Spirit
[2:18:11] to flow and what happens is we stay so
[2:18:14] busy you've got to you've got to feed
[2:18:16] your families
