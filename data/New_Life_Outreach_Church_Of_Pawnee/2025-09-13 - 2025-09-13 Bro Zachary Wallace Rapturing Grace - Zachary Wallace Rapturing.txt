Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just approach your throne again this morning, Lord, and we just can't thank you enough for the opportunity that we can gather ourselves together here as believers, Lord. And your scripture says that if there's two or three that are gathered together in your name, that you'll be here in our midst, Lord. And the God of gods, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords would come down into our presence. And Lord, we know that when you come, Lord, there's a purpose when you come. &gt;&gt; You don't just come out of a whim, but you come for a purpose, Lord. And we're just asking you, we're inviting you that you would just be comfortable in this place as we're singing these songs of worship, Lord. May it not just be words that are proceeding from our lips, Lord, but may it be worship coming from our heart. Father, we just ask that you would just be with the ministers he's preparing. &gt;&gt; Lord, may he just be able to get himself out of the way. May he just fall into the channel of the Holy Spirit, Lord. You know every need that's amongst the people this morning, Lord. And there's no way that a man could know all of those needs. But we know that if we serve a living God, Lord, you can come down and show yourself real amongst us this morning. Lord, we just ask that you would be with our uh pastor Ben, Lord, as he's not feeling very well. Father, we just ask that even now you would just go down and touch him. Lord, we know that you're the great physician, Father. There's no medicine, there's no doctor that could heal him, but only you can heal him, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're also looking for healing in our hearts, healing in our souls, healing in our body.

We want two this morning, don't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to sing, but I do just want to kind of share a testimony. This is that's what this song is about. Um, many of you know us, but uh my wife and I were married for 10 years trying to have a child and praying. And uh I know that uh some people are, you know, still waiting on a promise. And and if you've ever been through something like that where you you just don't know how long it's going to be. You know, God told Abraham, "I'm going to give you a child by Sarah, but he didn't say it was going to be 25 years." And so, um, it's a trial. But I want to just encourage you this morning that his ways are higher than ours. And that his word is still true. His promises that he makes are still going to come to pass. He's faithful. So, just if you know this song, worship with us. But uh I just want to say you know the Lord promised us a a child and he's sitting over here in the in the audience today and and the Lord even blessed us with two. So we appreciate God that he is faithful to his word. [Applause] [Music] It's not what I prayed for. It's not what I wanted. It's not something I understand. [Music] My circumstances seem so confusing. [Music] Placing it all in your head. Your ways are higher than mine. I want mountains to move. You want me to climb, so I'm going to trust your work, your will in your time. [Music] Your ways are higher than mine. [Music] One day I'm sure I will look back and marvel at how you knew best all along. You see from heaven, you know it's the hard time that makes my face steady and strong. Your ways are higher than mine. [Music] I want mountains to move. You want me to glide, so I'm going to trust your work, your will, in your time. Your ways are higher than mine. [Music] When I start to doubt, help me believe [Music] somewhere so far above me. Your ways are higher than mine. I want mountains to move. You want me to climb. So I'm going to trust your word, your will in your time. Oh, your ways are so much higher than mine. [Music] Your ways are higher [Music] than mine. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Did you enjoy that here this morning? &gt;&gt; So glad his ways are higher than ours. Amen. Can we sing this as we get ready for the three brothers to come see all my life you have been faithful and all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am aable. Oh, I will see of the goodness of God. All my life and all my life you have, oh my, has you been faithful? Oh my life. Oh my life, you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, oh I will see of the goodness of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hasn't he been so faithful to us? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And you know um our brother talking about those boys and you know how how long they waited for that that promise to come and you just can't you just can never give up must never give up. Amen. And um so they asked us to sing a couple of songs. Amen. [Music] It's such an honor to uh to have brother Shawn and brother Jonathan with us. And u we sure love brother Shawn and brother Jonathan.

And a lot of people have tried to fill it with religion, going to church, being religious. But there's nothing that can fill that except that relationship with the Lord as these two preachers that have been that have already ministered this week to us. It's got to be a living reality, a reality of Jesus, a living Christ, not an idol, but a living God. And I'm so thankful the Lord Jesus has filled that place within our hearts.

How many's come expecting something from the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; And um we um we started the meeting off with brother Matthew McGiri. Amen. Talking about the call, accepting his call. And then last night, Amen. Uh uh brother Nathan Ericson ministered along the lines of we are living idols. Amen. And we're not we're not serving a dead idol, but God has come. We we have prostrated oursel before a living God. God is now living in us, living his life through us. Oh, what a tremendous message that was. And so this morning we have brother Zack Wallace. And um Brother Zach is not a stranger here to our church. He's he's been preaching for us for uh years and and is a tremendous blessing. and and he's one of our favorites around here. And um so we're we're looking forward to having brother brother Zachary to minister the word of the Lord. And you pull on the gift.

It's just a wonderful morning to be a Christian, &gt;&gt; to be serving the Lord, &gt;&gt; to have your your heart right and your life ready for the coming of the Lord. It's just a wonderful thing to be together with saints of like precious faith. You know, when I wake up in the morning, I wake up happy. My wife doesn't appreciate that as much, but when I wake up, I wake up happy. I'm happy to be awake and happy for another day, another day to serve the Lord. And you know, this morning I woke up and I woke up and I had a smile on my face. Another day. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And then that smile started to fade. I said, "Oh, this day Saturday morning." And uh you know, honestly, the first thought I had was, "I wonder if I lost my voice. You know, maybe I can get out of this." But you know, if the Lord doesn't show up, it there's there's really no point in standing here. &gt;&gt; But if he'll come &gt;&gt; and he can say something, &gt;&gt; oh, it'll make all the difference. &gt;&gt; So, let's just talk to the Lord this morning. Heavenly Father, we just love you, Lord. Lord, and we want this to be your service, Lord. We want you to be welcome to move among us. We want you to have your way and just to speak to our hearts, Lord. Speak personally, Lord. May it not be these lips that speak, but may it be you that speaks through us, Lord. And may you just give ears to hear this morning, Lord. It's only you that can give the ear to hear, Lord. And may they receive the word on the inside, Lord. May we be edified and built up into that stature, Lord, that you are calling us to, Father. May we accept and receive your word this morning. And Lord, if there's anything in my heart, Lord, or in the congregation that might hinder you, Lord. Father, I ask that the blood of Jesus Christ would just come and purify and cleanse, Lord, to to make hearts that are ready to receive and a voice that can speak. Father, we just commit ourselves to you now and ask you would open up your word to our hearts in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn over to Job the 38th chapter. Just making sure everybody was awake there. And &gt;&gt; if you're asleep, that's all right. I can always come and shake your hand, wake you up. Don't worry about it. I've done that. Figure if I put him to sleep, I ought to wake him up. Job 38. Uh portion of scripture here that we probably all know by heart, but Job 38 and verse4 says after Job has been through a lot of hard times and he's in fact he's he's still in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; He's still in the middle of an ash sheep. He's still got trials on every side, but God comes down to talk to him. &gt;&gt; He says, "Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou hast understanding." Verse five, "Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest, or who hath stretched a line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the cornerstone thereof?" &gt;&gt; When the morning stars sang together, and all, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; all The sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, that blessed me to see that. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians chapter 4. First Thessalonians 4 and 15. &gt;&gt; You know, when when you read the word of God, you've got to identify your portion. You know, there's a portion that says that the that that tempter Lucifer, that old devil is going to be cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; That's not my verse. &gt;&gt; That's not my promise. That's his promise. &gt;&gt; You got to see yourself identified. And when I see sons of God shouting for joy, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it says all, &gt;&gt; that was me. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4 and 15. And here's a little more about about me as far as I'm concerned. 1 Thessalonians 4:15. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we we which are alive and remain and shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wherefore comfort ye one another with these words &gt;&gt; can be seated this morning. &gt;&gt; For a for a topic I I'd like to speak on rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; And uh I just want to to look at the grace of God this morning in in the context of a rapture. and also recognizing that this is the hour we're living in. We're living in the age of rapture. We're living in a rapturing age. We're living in a bride age. We're living at the time that these scriptures are to be fulfilled. That scripture has been laying there for over 2,000 years. It's been laying there. It's been laying there. But there's come a time when that word that's been spoken has to anchor into a soul to bring a manifestation to what has been prophesied. There was a there was a prophecy made by Isaiah and he said, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive." And that word went out and it just went out and it went out and it was waiting. It was waiting until finally it anchored in the womb of a virgin and it manifested the prophecy. And there has to be a people somewhere that's going to manifest the prophecy of First Thessalonians 4. Somebody's going to manifest that. Somebody's going to fulfill there's going to be somebody that was a pre-ordained, predestinated vessel that that word was going to anchor into to manifest the bride. and that's this hour. &gt;&gt; But you know, there's many people they they they don't recognize the hour we're living in. They don't recognize what's happening because it's the nature of man. He always thanks God for what he did and he looks forward what he's going to do and he misses what's happening right now in 2025. He misses what God's doing. Now, to to lay a little background here, Brother Brandham talking 1959 to to Brother Duffield and Brother Duplicus, and he says, "I wish there was some way I could let the people see what I'm talking about. We've got to have awakening right quick or you're going to miss the rapture." He says, "Friends, it could happen at any time." And so, I want to deal with that concept of missing the rapture. All right? He says, "Listen, brothers, you you they were Pentecostal brothers, leaders, they were great men." He says, "Listen, you got to wake up. You got to wake up or you're going to miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, over here in in questions and answers, he says, "Oh, they've got millions of or uh this is the third seal." He says, "They got millions of church members and but no revival nowhere." And he says the bride hasn't had a revival yet. He says there's been no revival, no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet, but we're looking for it now. And it'll take those seven un thunders back there to wake her up again. See? Yeah. He said he'd send it. He promised it. So, so we look at these things. We're like, "Oh, well, we don't want to miss the rapture. We don't want to miss the rapture someday. There's going to be a bride's revival someday." And and they're looking for it somewhere else. They're looking for it somewhere in the distance. But when he's saying this here, there there's got to be a bride's revival somewhere. It's in the third seal, &gt;&gt; which makes all the difference. &gt;&gt; He says he says it's got to be there. He says those seven thunders, it's going to take that to to really bring that bride's revival. &gt;&gt; And then you go over to questions and answers and they ask about what about these seven thunders? He said, "Oh, well, they were revealed in the seven seals. That's what the thunders was about." &gt;&gt; So, as he's saying, there's going to be a bride's revival. You've We're looking for it. We're looking for it. It's taking place. It's being broke forth. It's happening right then. But people still in this day are looking for it somewhere else. Looking for it in some other time. But I say this day, this scripture has been fulfilled. There is a bride of Jesus Christ and she's not worried about missing the rapture because she is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, this bride's revival isn't somewhere out there some other time. If this book was not open, then it would be for some other day. It would be for some other time. But we're living in the day when the word has come open and the bride's revival has been unleashed upon the earth. That's right. &gt;&gt; So to say it very plain, the opening of the word is the bride's revival. The opening of the word is the awakening of this bride out of dark denominationalism. There has been a resurrection again to life. And it's the same type of resurrection as when Jesus came out of the grave. It's the same one. It's the same one that went down into the grave is the same life that's come back out in this last age manifesting Jesus Christ, the word made flesh. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, you know, that that we've got to got to have this awakening. And he says, or we we might miss the rapture. Well, the awakening's happened. &gt;&gt; So, he says, we've got to have an awakening so we don't miss it. &gt;&gt; But if the awakening's happened, &gt;&gt; you going to miss it. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Oh, no. Not going to happen. The awakening of the bride has already taken place. She can't miss it. and and like we could look at a uh when I I get to travel a little bit doing uh mission work overseas and and so I've been on hundreds of planes now and and you know the first plane flight was really exciting but now it's just another trial but you know you get on that plane and and you know before before the flight I'm leaving out actually um Monday morning 5 in the morning we head to the airport get there and I'm not going to sleep good Sunday night because I got a plane to catch. I got a plane to catch. Oh, I mean I don't want to miss that flight. And so I set alarm and then I set a timer and then I set another alarm because I don't want to miss it. &gt;&gt; You see, there's this there's this nervous tension. I don't want to miss that flight. And so I set all my alarms. I want to make sure I I wake up for it and I get all that ready and and then we're going to the airport and I try to leave with plenty of time to get there so that I won't be late. And we we get there and I'm making sure there's no traffic jam. I don't want anything to keep me from making on that flight. And so I prepare. I lay aside things. You say, "Oh, well, I could have a little bit of time for that." I was like, "It's not worth it. It's not worth it. I got to make it on that flight. I got a place to go." And so I I move everything out of the way. We get there and I get there early and I'm just sitting there. I'm waiting and I'm get I get to the gate. I go through security. It's like, "Okay, another check mark where we're past that. We're past that. We've gone past that barrier. We've gone past that barrier." And I'm I'm just sitting at the gate, you know, but I'm still I I missed a flight one time sitting at the gate, you know, and I'm like, "No, it's not it's not time to relax yet. You can't let your guard down yet, you know. I I got to get on that plane. But you know what? &gt;&gt; When I get past all those barriers, when I get past everything and I get on that plane and then I go to my seat where I have a ticket, I have a token with my name on it and I go to my seat. I get in my position and when I'm sitting there, the worry is over, friends. The concern's over. I'm in my position. I'm just waiting. And when that plane's going down the runway, I'm not saying I'm worried. I wonder. I can feel the power vibrating. I can feel the pulsation. I know where it's taking me. The fear is over. I am resting in my position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not worried about missing it. I can feel the pulsation. I can feel that pulsation of a heavenly realm. I'm already on board this Holy Ghost power that's taking me into the plus. Guys, it's no more fear. It's rest. &gt;&gt; Resting. in God's election. &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't got a ticket this morning, &gt;&gt; there's a way to get one. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a ticket with your name on it, it's called the token, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I invite you to come and to see a ticketing agent this morning and get your ticket. Get your token. Because without that, you could show up and say, "Hey, I got a lot of money. I did a lot of good deeds. I did all these things. &gt;&gt; They don't care. Give me the token. Without that token, you are not getting on that flight. But with that ticket, you know, sometimes they'll leave a flight, a flight will take off and they'll leave some people behind because, you know, they just didn't get there in time. &gt;&gt; This plane isn't that way. &gt;&gt; You know, there's sometimes they they'll they'll book a flight and they'll overbook the flight because they say, "Ah, some people might miss it. I don't know. We want to try to get as many people as possible in the bride, so we'll just oversell it." And then and then maybe, you know, some people enough will show up to make a make a bride. Come on. &gt;&gt; No. No. This flame, this trip to glory isn't going to have one empty seat. There's not going to be one person missing from this rapture. Every ticketed passenger will be in their position and we'll be ready to take off. You don't have to worry. You don't have to fear, little bride. You just can hear the words shalom. Be at peace. Be at rest. God's got this plan figured out. Oh, you know that the the the peace and the rest that comes when you realize &gt;&gt; your identity, &gt;&gt; your position. &gt;&gt; You got to have an identity to get on that plane. Friends, &gt;&gt; you're you're not going in this rapture and saying, "Oh, I don't think that's me. No, that's not me. That's not me." You know, there comes a time when you say, "You see this? &gt;&gt; It's me. &gt;&gt; You see this identification? You see that this this word that's been given? You look at that. You look at that. See that? That's me. You can see I am the reflection. I am the manifestation of that identification. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a it's an exciting thing when you realize that you don't have to worry about it. You don't have to work it up. You don't have to manufacture it. You just have to match the identification. &gt;&gt; I never go to that airport and say, "I hope I look like Zachary today." I don't go, "Okay, let me let me me hold my breath just right. Let me stand just right so so I look like &gt;&gt; I'm not an impersonator. &gt;&gt; It's just who I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother talks about this group and they're fasting and praying, hoping for a revival, calling for a revival. They says, "Oh, fast and pray. It's not too late yet." And he says, "Why are they doing that? Why do they do that? They want a great awakening and they're crying believing there will be an awakening. And they're good people. But why is it? What have they done? They have not recognized the awakening of the bride. But being a Christian, they feel the pull of the hour. But they haven't recognized what's been done. &gt;&gt; Oh, they have not recognized what's been done, but they feel the pull. They feel that call. They hear it. They they they know there's something there, and they're looking for something that's actually taking place right amongst them. He says they haven't recognized what's h already happened right by you. &gt;&gt; And I say to you that it could be happening right in you. &gt;&gt; But it's God in such a humble simple way expressing himself and you're looking for some great exciting mystical thing when it's God revealed in humility and in simplicity in your very life, in your very heart, and you're looking for something that's not actually what he prophesied. And so you you get this idea, oh, it's going to be like this. this is going to be like this. No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Don't look for it that way. Don't look for us to be running around and emptying out all the hospitals and and having public television series where everybody can see the great and the mighty guy that that this person is. No. No. That's human thinking. &gt;&gt; What God calls great, &gt;&gt; man calls foolish. And what man calls foolish, God calls great. &gt;&gt; You can go down through the scriptures a hundred different places and you can see that expression. But you see, God, when he's doing this bride, when he's bringing forth this bride, it's beautiful in his sight. &gt;&gt; It's great and it's mighty in his sight. And you've got to get into his thinking. You got to get under the anointing of the message of the hour and see it the way he sees it. Otherwise, you'll be looking at it through eyes of flesh and you'll miss it by 100 miles. &gt;&gt; Now, prophet tells us there's got to be a rapture. He says, "If there's not a rapture, friends, then where are we at? What are we going to do? What age are we living in? What promises do we have? &gt;&gt; He says, "But there's going to be a rapture." &gt;&gt; The Bible says there will be, and it'll only be for the elected, the elected lady, the bride in this day that's pulled out the church. &gt;&gt; He says we're living up here in the bride age, the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture. That's the age that we're living in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we're we're not looking for someday to have an invisible union. &gt;&gt; No, it's not someday. Sometime I'll finally be united with Christ. No. No. That is something that is already a reality. The bride is already united with Christ. She has already come in an invisible union. You say, "Well, why haven't I seen it?" &gt;&gt; Invisible union. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. Prophecy says it in that day that the son of man will be revealed. He says what? To join the church to the head. Unite the marriage of the bride. The bridegroom call will come right through this. When the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together. The church has to be the word. He is the word and the two unites together. And to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man, not a clergyman. Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, "Do you see what I mean? See, it's the son of man, Jesus Christ, will come down in human flesh among us, and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one, the bride. And then she'll go home to the wedding supper. She's already united. See, we go to the wedding supper, not to the marriage." So, right now is the time for the marriage relationship. Right now is the time for the uniting of Christ and the bride. Not someday, not some future tense, but right now is the time for you and Christ. You and the word to become one. This is the hour for the manifestation of the sons of God. This is the hour for you, the bride, to be manifested as the word. Not some other day, not some other time, &gt;&gt; this day. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, but you know, I'm not good enough or I can't I the the bride I I don't know how I could ever be, you know, that perfect, that righteous, and and could you give me that little picture? Uh I I would normally probably build this out of wood and bring it to church, but I'm trying to be a little more dignified today. But um you know, we look at we see a person, we see their life, and and you know, when they first become a Christian, they first come to the Lord, they they have so much sin in their life. There's so much just just filthiness all around them, and and and they're just they're just lost in the pit of sin. But but they come and they say, "God, you know, I need help. I I need a savior." And he begins to work in their life and he begins to clean up a little bit here and a little bit there. And he begins to, you know, change these things. And that's wonderful. That's good. And and so we look at oursel and we say, "Well, you see this person over here, this this this man, he's been serving the Lord for a long time. He's he's really righteous now. I mean, he's he's really a good man now, but you know, I'm still down here. I'm trying to do better. I'm I'm trying to get better." And we we know that the bride of Jesus Christ is is is a righteous, pure, spotless, perfect bride. And and so we're like, well, if I could just get good enough, maybe I could attain unto to that position of the perfect bride. And and we're trying to build up to that. But you know, the reality of it is this. The prophet of God said that the angels look dirty in his sight. &gt;&gt; The angels are dirty. We are filthy and he's righteous. How are you ever going to get to where that classification of righteous? How are you ever going to do it? How are you ever going to have enough good works? How are you ever going to have enough good abilities and things to offer him so that you say, "Well, now I'm righteous." Oh, no, friends, it's not going to happen. You're never going to get to that place where you're finally so good that you have become righteous. No, you've got it backwards. But we, you know, we have this mentality. We actually have a complex in our minds because we know the bride is perfect. We know she's the pure, spotless, virtuous bride. We know that by prophecy, but then the devil tries to get us to manufacture that by our own human ability. You will never fulfill it. You'll never become righteous by your ability. You know what? Your good works, the very best you can produce is filthy rags. &gt;&gt; The best of your righteousness is filthy rags. So if that's all you can produce is filthiness, you could never even make it to dirty friends. And there's impossible for you to ever be righteous. But there was one who came. Hallelujah. And he became sin. He became filthy that he might give you the very righteousness of God. Oh, there is nothing you can do to make yourself righteous, but you can receive the very righteousness of God. So that you compared to an angel and the angel would look dirty in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; An angel that never sinned, never had a bad thought, never one thing, but that angel does not have the righteousness of God. But this bride of Jesus Christ through the blood of Christ has come under that sacrifice and she is perfect. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's grace. That's grace. &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of your ability, off of your works, off of what you can manufacture, cuz the best you can manufacture is filthy. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you can just catch that revelation that it's God's grace alone that washes you and takes you into the holiness and the righteousness and the goodness of God. And and don't get this, people get this backwards. They think that good works produce righteousness. &gt;&gt; That's a lie. &gt;&gt; Good works does not produce righteousness. Good works produces filthy rags. &gt;&gt; But righteousness produces good works. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you can get the righteousness of God on your life, it will produce good works. But if you try to produce good works, all you'll get is filthy rags. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's time we laid aside our abilities. It's time we laid aside our good works, our efforts, our oh, I'm going to do this. No, lay that aside and let him come down. Let him come down and fulfill through you the prophecy of the hour. Let his righteousness be expressed in you because all you got is filthy rags. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about grace this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a grace that's beyond any other grace. I'm talking about a a rapturing grace, a grace like we've never imagined before. Oh, you know Jesus Christ when he was on earth, he walked with the disciples. He went fishing with them. You know, maybe they went hunting together. Uh they they had good time. They they enjoyed their their time together. And Jesus was a man. 100% man. &gt;&gt; But you know, the disciples walked with him for for years. And one day he asked, "Who do you say that I am?" And Peter said, "You are the son of God. &gt;&gt; You are the the Christ." And Jesus said, "Flesh and blood never revealed this to you." &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God picks it up and he says this and Christ mystery of God revealed. He said, "Peter had seen him in flesh but didn't know him by flesh." &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "So flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you. Even my own life didn't reveal it to you. And you expect to look in the mirror &gt;&gt; and see it by your fleshly eyes. &gt;&gt; You expect to look in the mirror and say, "Yeah, that's that pure perfect bride. Yeah, that's that." Yeah. No. No. Your flesh and blood will never reveal it to you. It has to be a divine revelation. And when you catch that, when God reveals to you, you are my pearl virtuous bride. You are the one I'm longing for. Not your fleshly eyes. Flesh and blood will never reveal it, but my father in heaven will reveal it to you. And when you catch that revelation, the gates of hell won't prevail against it. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't look at your flesh. Don't look at your ability. It will never reveal the promise for this hour. &gt;&gt; It's by revelation alone. Prophet of God says, "Are you and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmmerited grace, a wedding band of grace, unmmerited of your own." God did it himself and he knew you before the foundation of the world. So he slipped the wedding band on you there. Put your name on a book. &gt;&gt; So what did you do to earn being the bride of Jesus Christ? Before you were ever here, &gt;&gt; he took his wedding band &gt;&gt; and he slipped it on your finger, &gt;&gt; predestinated, unmmerited of your own. God did it himself. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, what a thanksgiving." &gt;&gt; Oh, if you can just realize that it's not your ability that puts you in the bride of Jesus Christ. It's his choosing, his election, his call on your life. It's his prophecy for this hour, not your ability. &gt;&gt; Whenever you can get a whenever you get away from grace and you start leaning on that fleshy arm of of your own ability, you know, you're limited &gt;&gt; because you're just as big as as you are. But when you're leaning on the arm of Almighty God, when you're trusting in him, well, then it's just as big as he is. &gt;&gt; And uh it &gt;&gt; that's a big difference. my my brother-in-law, he uh Nathan Eritt up in up in Ohio there, he started a little coffee shop and and so him and me lots of times we get our heads together and we're like, well, what could we do to make this coffee shop, you know, work? Because, you know, contrary to a lot of people's opinion, businesses are a lot of work. And he's trying to figure out how do we make money doing this? Because, you know, it takes time for for a business to become successful. And we're like, well, maybe we could do a little bit of this. And okay, that worked a little bit. Maybe we could do a little bit of this. trying a lot of different ideas trying to you know make this a successful business and but you know last week he was sitting in his office and he read a quote and the prophet of God was talking about how the Holy Ghost himself would come down and and that's why people believe in miracles that's why the miraculous takes place and he says and the reason you believe God we believe in miracles and signs and wonders is because you are sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; he says well you I'm a son of God and that means I should be believing for miracles. &gt;&gt; And and he just stopped and he he really searched his heart and he realized that he he didn't want God to do a miracle for his business because he thought he could do it. He thought that he could handle it. That, you know, surely I'm smart enough to to run a little coffee shop. Surely I'm smart enough and I I can solve these problems. And he just said, &gt;&gt; he said, "No, no." And he just he just repented right there. He says, "God, that's the wrong mentality." He says, "God, I want you to do a miracle. I want to welcome you into my coffee shop. I want to see you do the miraculous in my business because I'm not smart enough. I'm not good enough. I'm not big enough. I need you." &gt;&gt; That afternoon, his sales went off the chart. &gt;&gt; The next day, it was a record-breaking day. The end of the week came. He said, "Zachary, I've never had a week like this." He says, "This is better than our grand opening." He says, "The numbers are completely off the chart." [Music] &gt;&gt; When you welcome God into your situation, when you say, "God, I'm not big enough. I can't do this by myself. I want you to come down." It re unleashes omnipotence into your midst. Oh friends, &gt;&gt; perfect strength by perfect weakness. If you think you got this, then you'll only have the strength of man. But if you say, "God, I need you." If you'll hold up your hand and say, "Lord, I need you in my boat. I need you on the scene for my situation." He will come down. He's waiting for somebody to call him out of history. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You know the prophet of God said about Jesus sleeping in the boat there. He says it and go awaken Jesus. He said you know the storm was rocking and raging. He says and you know I doubt very much he was asleep. &gt;&gt; So why wasn't he calming the storm? Why wasn't he speaking peace? Why wasn't he helping them out? &gt;&gt; They had they were trying to row that boat on their own. They were trying to bail that boat on their own. They were trying to do it on their own. And they'd never called him on the scene. But friends, my God's not dead. And my God isn't asleep. He's just waiting for somebody to release him on the scene. He's waiting for somebody to recognize his presence so that his power can be unleashed. When they recognized that he was in the boat, when he recognized it was their opportunity, they called him on the scene and they seen the miraculous take place. &gt;&gt; So, what about you? &gt;&gt; Do you got this? You got this on your own. You got these situations figured out. You got it all taken care of on your own. Or do you have me to something this morning? Do you have need of something a little bigger than you, a little smarter than you, a little greater than you? Do you have need of Almighty God? Cuz if you have need of him, he's looking for somewhere where he can pour out himself and meet that need. &gt;&gt; You know, the devil, he hates to he hates to be exposed. And the word of God exposes him. It exposes his tactics. It exposes who he is. It exposes what he does. But the devil hates it. Prophet dog talks about it how how the people would come up in the prayer lines or in the discernment and and how when that devil realized he was being exposed and how how he would start to scream out asking for help and the the expression on the people, you know, he would talk about that. And I want you to realize this morning that the devil is trying to hide. &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to hide in your life, in your situations because he doesn't want to be exposed. And so, uh, uh, uh, for example, I have a this morning I have an ankle that's kind of a little bit weak and I sprained it up back a couple of weeks ago. And so I've been wearing an ankle brace and I've just been going along and I've been saying, "Well, this is normal." You know, this is normal. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what normal is. When I'm over in heaven and I'm dancing around the throne of God, I ain't going to have any weak angles. I'm not going to have that. That is what my normal is, not what this earth brings upon me. And so if Satan comes and he brings something that's normal, I say, "But is it according to God's word? Is it according to what God says about this situation?" Because if it's not what God says, I don't want it. &gt;&gt; I don't want normal Leodysia. I want normal heavenly places. That's what I want. &gt;&gt; I want to accept what God promised for me right now. &gt;&gt; So here's a simple example. um here among us right now. How many people here have have a sickness or an infirmity in their body? Something that the devil put there? &gt;&gt; Just just hold your hands up. Hold your hands up. Look up. Look around. I want you to look around. I want you to realize that the devil is attacking the bride of Jesus Christ. He's on a rampage. He's attacking. He's tormenting. That's what he is. He's a tormentor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what does God say? You know, I the in this day, Brother Brand says it's a nervous, neurotic age in which it seems we're unfit to live. He says, "If time would go along a little bit far, there'd be total insanity." And so, we we were in an age when the the mind is being tormented and and Satan's coming in every which direction. And so, this morning, I'm asking you, how many here have to fight with nervousness? Just hold up your hand. How many here have to have to fight with those nervous battles that that anxiety, the the nervousness, the the fear, the the the darkness, the depression, the discouragement. It's all over. &gt;&gt; But you know, he tries to hide, &gt;&gt; but you just exposed him. &gt;&gt; And you know what? He didn't like that. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to recognize it's not hard. It's not complicated. I want you to recognize what God said &gt;&gt; about sickness, about nervousness, about anxiety. &gt;&gt; It says he was wounded for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace &gt;&gt; was upon him &gt;&gt; and with his stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; One sacrifice settled the sin question. It settled the healing of the body, the spirit and the soul. It was one sacrifice forever that took care of your situation. So I don't care what nervousness you're dealing with, what if it's cancer or whether it's a toothache. I don't care what it is. My God is the one that is the healer of all your diseases. He's the one that forgives all your iniquities. One sacrifice settled the question. &gt;&gt; Do you lo? And so I I ask you this this morning, do you believe that you can be healed? Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe that you can be healed &gt;&gt; body, spirit, and soul. &gt;&gt; You know, I you can be set free from nervousness, fear, anxiety, &gt;&gt; because you see, fear, it didn't come from God. &gt;&gt; He didn't send you a spirit of fear. That wasn't him. He gives a a spirit of love and of peace and of a sound mind. It's a different person bringing that fear into your life. And so if it's not from God, you don't have to keep it. &gt;&gt; And you know, back several years ago in 2023, December 31st, 2023, I sitting in church service, Brother Andrew Glover was preaching on overcoming fear. And I said, "My nature is such that I'm not a very fearful person, which helps me sometimes and gets me into trouble other times, but I just I'm not a fearful person." And so I was trying not to pitchfork the whole sermon on to my neighbors, you know, like, "Oh, that's good for the person over there and that's good for the person over there." Because, you know, that's not what you're supposed to be doing in church. In church, you're saying, "Lord, talk to me. I want something for me. I'm not asking about, you know, how I can apply this to my neighbor. I want it for me." And so I'm like, "Lord, where am I fearful?" because I don't see it. I don't see that that fear in me. And and he just answered me very clearly. He said, "You're afraid to claim your healing." Now, &gt;&gt; you see, because ever since I was a young boy, for for 30 years, I've had migraine headaches and just, you know, you curl up in a ball and you're vomiting and you're you're just it it's it's horrible. And and I I've had these migraine headaches and and I said, you know, I'd asked the Lord 10 years ago. I I I said, "Lord, I want to know. Did you put this in my life? Did you put this here or can I be healed?" &gt;&gt; And so, I went to a meeting and I said, "Lord, I'm here for to answer to my question. I want to know, can I be healed of this?" And the Lord in his goodness, he gave me a very clear-cut answer. He said, "I didn't put that there. You can be healed." And I was so excited. I said, "Oh, praise God, Hannah. I'm telling you, I can be healed of this. God told me I can be healed of this." And I was so excited. And 10 years later, I still had those migraine headaches. And somewhere in my thinking, &gt;&gt; the devil had slipped one up on me. And he got it to where I was thinking someday when I was good enough, someday when I'd done something that just made heaven smile, maybe I'd preached a good enough sermon, maybe I'd won enough souls to the Lord, he would be so happy with me that he would heal me. &gt;&gt; That's a lie. &gt;&gt; And I I said that that's not right. I said, I can't earn my healing. I can't do anything to merit my healing. The only thing I can do is accept my healing. And I said, "Then Lord, this night right now, December 31st, 2023, is the night I accept my healing from migraine headaches." And I began to stand on that. I began to testify of that. I began to confess that because I knew that he had given me a promise that not only I could be healed, but that he'd already healed me. It it it took several months went by and I'm still standing there. I'd be curled up over a trash can vomiting up and my head just a pounding and just standing there saying, "Lord, thank you for healing me. Thank you for healing me. I don't care how I feel. I don't care what the symptom is. That means nothing. Your word said I'm healed. I don't care what I feel. I don't care what I see. Your promise is eternal and it is true." And this is the lie. &gt;&gt; And so I stood on that for four months until we went up to brother Shawn Martin's camp meeting up there. And I was there going up to help with the prayer line with a pounding migraine. I said, I'm going to have to carry somebody out of the tent and go vomit behind the tent somewhere and then stagger back there. But I says, you know what? I believe I'm healed. I've confessed I'm healed. I'm going to act like I'm healed. And as I walked up to that prayer line, that migraine headache vanished and my body was completely healed. Oh, when you're not looking at how good you are or you're going to earn something, you just say, "I accept it." Not some other day. Not some other time. This day, I accept it right now. I'm standing on that. I'm a faith seed of Abraham. He made the promise and I am a believer. And this day is the day that I possess my mountain. If you're waiting to get good enough, you'll have a mighty long wait. But if you're looking if he's good enough, &gt;&gt; if you're looking if he made the promise, if you're looking at what he said, then you can have it this day because he is worthy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells a story of his friend Papa Cox. &gt;&gt; Papa Cox was a chain smoker of cigarettes, just smoking and smoking and smoking. And he was a friend of brother Brams. He says, "Well, Papa, why don't you give your heart to the Lord? Why don't you become a Christian? He says, "You you you love the Lord. You believe in him." He says, "Oh, yes." He says, "But these cigarettes, Brother Brandon, if I could just stop these cigarettes." And he said, he says, "Well, Papa, you don't be why why don't you become a Christian?" And he said, "Well, I can't be I would become a Christian when I can get good enough." &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I tell you what you do, Papa. You look around till you find a place where you can get good enough. Then tell me where that place is cuz I want to go too. He said Christ never came to save good men. &gt;&gt; He came to save sinners that knew they were sinners that knew they needed a God to redeem them from their fallen condition. Not people who said, "I'm good enough." That's not who he came for. If you think you're good enough, if you think you don't you don't need a savior, then he's not there for you. But if you say, "God, I can't do it. I'm not big enough. I'm not worthy. I need a savior." Then that's the one he came for. He came to save sinners that knowed they were sinners. &gt;&gt; And he he began talking about them and he said, "Oh, these cigarettes." He says, "I'm not talking about these cigarettes." He says, "M" He says, "Papa, listen." He says, "I'm not a legalist. I don't care about them cigarettes." He says, "I believe in grace. Just forget about it." He says, "I want to ask you one question. Do you believe Jesus Christ came to save sinners? Do you believe he came to redeem man? Do you believe that God came down and crossed his train with man? And do you expect accept it on that basis that that he's worthy? He says, "What about him?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, brother Brandon, he's worthy." &gt;&gt; I said, "Then accept what he gives you." &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm asking you this morning. You want to be set free. You want to be delivered. You want to be healed. I'm not asking you how good you are. Is he worthy? What's your confession? If he's worthy, then accept it what he offers you. &gt;&gt; Took the man down to the water, baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is the only name given under heaven whereby you must be saved. Baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ, and he rose up out of that water and he smoked another cigarette. Couple weeks went by, I think it was a month went by. &gt;&gt; One day he'd had a little injury at the and he was laying there in his bed and they brought him his package of cigarettes. He said, "Get them things away from me. I don't want those things. I don't desire those things anymore." &gt;&gt; He'd found a place that could make him good. He'd found something that could change him from the inside. Not his ability. He didn't work it up. He didn't manufacture it. But almighty God came down through the power of the Holy Ghost and changed his very desires. Changed his nature and put the nature of Christ in him. &gt;&gt; Oh, scripture says that we all as unclean, we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness is are as filthy rags. &gt;&gt; And so the best this bride could ever produce in righteousness is filthy rags. Your good works will never put you in the rapture. It won't do it. It's the grace of God that will put you in the rapture. It is the elective grace of God. It's not your good works that put you in a rapture. It's his choosing. It's his call. It's his righteousness. A and your Christian life will never be enough in your ability to earn you a slot in the rapture. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's grace. And you say, "Well, you know, if it's not if it's not how good I am or or Brother Colby, if it's not if it's not all your efforts and your ability, then what makes you any different than anyone else?" &gt;&gt; Grace, &gt;&gt; God's favor on your life, &gt;&gt; his love to choose you as his bride, &gt;&gt; that's what separates you and sets you apart. &gt;&gt; The grace of God. &gt;&gt; Prophet God talks about that. He says, "You know, that woman takes that garment, she lays out the calico, when she sets it there, and then she just chooses a place &gt;&gt; to begin to cut. She found a place that she just wanted to cut out that garment and she laid it there. It's the same type of fabric." And she cuts it out and she takes this piece and she makes a dress out of it. And the other part's just a pile of remnants that she sets aside. The same fabric, the same material, just as good as anything else in the pile. But she chooses one part to make that dress out of and the other is set aside. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says it's just he it's it's it's it's his business where he lays out the pattern. It's God's business where he lays the pattern. He cuts her right out. It's Is that right? Now, the rest of this calico here, it's just as good a calico as in the dress. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But it's God's election. &gt;&gt; So, what are you? Are you a product of your ability and your good works? &gt;&gt; No. You're under the choosing of his elective grace on your life. &gt;&gt; Oh, that call, it's not an optional call, brother Matthew. When he calls, they will answer. &gt;&gt; Oh, you you see when when we look at this this uh rapture in grace, we see that it it's something that it's God's choosing. It's God's election on your life, not anything you can manufacture. It's the faith of God. It's not your faith. It's not your ability. It's his faith. It's not your works. It's his works. It's not your righteousness. It's his righteousness. It's God from beginning to end because you see, man will always fail. But God says, "I'm going to have a bride. And so, I'm going to have to handle the process from start to finish. I'm going to have to come down and I'm going to have to be in it from the day they're at the altar all the way to the day they take a rapture. It's going to be me manifesting and expressing myself through them because if I leave it to the arm of flesh, it won't work. &gt;&gt; And so he came down and God became flesh in a bride in a people, but it's in such a humble simple way that flesh and blood will never reveal it to you. Oh, &gt;&gt; you look at you look at the the grace of God that would come to you and and prophet of God says that your new life is in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; It's your marriage certificate. &gt;&gt; So you say, "Well, who's part of this elected bride? Who is the people? Who are the ones?" &gt;&gt; Well, it's you've got to have a marriage certificate. that if your name's on that marriage certificate, it's settled. It's over. I It's peace. It's shalom. If your name's on that marriage certificate, but if your name's not on there, there's nothing you can do to put your own name on there. &gt;&gt; And so you you say, "Well, how do we know? How do we know whose name's on on that marriage certificate and who's not? What what's it about?" Well, that's the beautiful thing about the message of the hour. He said, "God, put your name your your your new life in the lamb's book of life, your marriage certificate." So that lamb's book of life has the names written down of the marriage certificate holders. It has the names written down of who is a part of this bride of Jesus Christ. And you say, "Well, how can we look at it? How can we read that? How can we find out if my name's on there?" Well, it's very simple, friends. God has sent us a message in this day that took that book and opened it up that we might read our name written on that book. &gt;&gt; Oh, the only way you can be a part of that bride is if your name was put on that book, lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And you know what? Before the foundation of the world, when the sons of God seen that happening, got mighty excited. The &gt;&gt; prophet of God tells us how he says they were shouting for joy because they seen their names written on that book before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And so if they were shouting then &gt;&gt; and you catch the revelation now, &gt;&gt; you'll do the same thing. &gt;&gt; That book was sitting in the right hand of him that sat on the throne and it was a sealed book. Nobody knew if they were a part of it. They didn't know. They weren't sure. And they were weeping and wailing because there was no man that was worthy to open that book. But then there was a call made for a kinsman redeemer. And there came a lamb that stepped forward, a lamb that had prevailed. And he opened that book and he tore off the seals. And the prophet of God said he tore off the seals and he sent it down to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people. &gt;&gt; So according to the message of this hour, those names have been that were sealed up that were held up that nobody knew about. They were opened up and it was sent down by the seventh angel to reveal it to his people. &gt;&gt; So that means &gt;&gt; you can find out. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said John must have looked past the curtain of time and looked in there and seen himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he had himself a screaming fit when he realized that he was a part of this. When he recognized that his name was on there and there was nothing that could take it off. when he recognized the security of his position. I'm a part of this and there's nothing going to stop me. Well, it's time for a jubilee time. &gt;&gt; You know, we see that that book come down, Revelations 10. I and you know, you're familiar with this, but we see those seven thunders begin to utter their voices when that book was coming down open. &gt;&gt; And that's the bride's revival. them seven thunders. You see, because when that book came open, when those thunders declared out, it began to reveal the bride of Jesus Christ, it began to identify her say who she was. And it's something that that is so sublime we can't comprehend it. The recognition that God would have a people that he chose of his election, of his predestination before the foundation of the world, he says there's going to be a bride and Jonathan Martin's a part of it. And he put that name right there. He says there's going to be a bride. Wendle Martin's a part of it. He put those names down there. And you know, no matter what, you might have been in the darkest of darkest pits, you might have been there. But that whole time when you were in sin, well, you were yet dead in sin. Your name was still on that book. On your good days, your name's on that book. On your bad days, your name's on that book. It doesn't change the election of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, when you catch that revelation, it's a shalom to the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, he says in that first seal, he says he was commissioned to write everything he'd seen. But when those seven thunders over in Revelations 10 uttered, he said, "Don't write it. Don't write it at all." He says, "There are mysteries." Now, this is the first seal. And the prophet of God says, "Now, we don't know what they are yet, but my opinion, they'll be revealed right away. And when it do, it'll give faith for that rapturing grace for the church to be moved out. &gt;&gt; Faith. Now, I just I want you to pay real close attention to the to the form of these words. Faith for that rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Now, Prophet of God preaches many times about rapturing faith, maybe about 30 times, about 15 times about about rapturing grace. And but I want you to realize you have to have a faith for this kind of grace. Now, if if if we were to look at uh you know, my my uh where's where's Shalom at? Right here. There she is right there. Shalom, would you stand up, please? Now, if if someday, you know, a young man were to come up to you and he'd begin to talk to you, he'd say, "My you, you know, your hair is just so beautiful and I I just I just love to to to to see and look in your eyes. You're you're just so beautiful in my sight." And you know, I I I just really I want to I want I I want to marry you. You know, I just love you so much. Now, you got to have some questions here. You know, well, you got a lot of questions, but we'll just deal with one of them right now. And that is, &gt;&gt; do you believe him? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he actually likes you? Come on. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that his favor has actually fallen on you? &gt;&gt; You see, if you don't have a faith &gt;&gt; in his choosing, his grace on your life, &gt;&gt; you you'd just turn around, walk away. &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Oh, no. No, it couldn't be me because, you know, my hair is not straight like the other girls. is curly and you know and I don't have black hair and it it's blonde and oh I &gt;&gt; but if you believe what he's saying &gt;&gt; if you actually believe that Wesley Martin has found favor in the sight of God &gt;&gt; if you can have that faith in his grace &gt;&gt; preacher Beautiful. &gt;&gt; You know, not just a grace that will will put up with you a little bit. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a grace that was so great. A favor that was so strong that he came down and he gave his life for a purpose to redeem a bride to himself. The favor of God, the grace of God, the love of God so powerful that he condescended from the throne of heaven and came down and was made flesh that he might call you to himself. faith &gt;&gt; for grace. &gt;&gt; I ask you this morning, was he talking about you? &gt;&gt; Oh, is there something inside of you that says, "I know I'm not good enough. I know I'm not worthy enough, but God, I I just I just believe you were talking to me. I There's something in me that gives me a faith that your grace is upon my life. There's something in me that I just believe, Lord, that you were talking about me, that I'm identified and a part of this. You see, when those seals begin to come open and it begins to identify you, it'll give you a faith for that rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Because it'll identify you. It'll let you know who you are. Oh, prophet of God goes through showing how that that that third pole that that climax of his ministry and how it would come to that great point and he says we know it's been identified and it's it's here. It's among us and and he says that this will be the thing to my opinion. He says I don't say the Lord tells me this. He said it was his opinion. Well, it's mine too. It's my opinion just as well. This will be a thing that third poll. This will be a thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away. &gt;&gt; And he says, now over here, he says, now remember the third pole was the opening of them seven seals. &gt;&gt; Now I want you just now there's there's the seals have so much in them, but I just want to look at one little facet of this faith for grace, rapturing faith, how it's unleashing a bride's revival, how it's doing all this that opening of the word. And I just want to look at one little part of that and that's when that book come open, &gt;&gt; John seen his identity. &gt;&gt; And when he seen his identity, the prophet of God, he said he must have looked in and seen his name wrote there when them seals broke. Another place he says he says how he looked in he seen himself beyond the curtain of time. Now, I want you to realize if you could catch a vision of the eternities of God, and you could see all the angels gathered around the throne, and you could see all the redeemed gathered around the throne in the eternities after everything settled, after everything's cleared, and you could look beyond that curtain of time, and you could see yourself shouting and dancing and praising God around that throne. Well, it takes all the worry away. It takes all the fear away cuz you already made it. You already know the end of the story. You've seen the final conclusion to the question. It's not a question of could I make it. It's the question of how could you not make it. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, John had a a revival. He John stepped into the bride's revival when the book came open and he seen his identification &gt;&gt; because you see this message, this third pole ministry, it breaks through the amnesia. It breaks through that and it begins to identify a people and it begins to tell you who you were from before the foundation of the world when all the sons of God were shouting for joy. It begins to identify you and tell you you were a part of him from the beginning. You were a part of him in his mind when he was on the cross. You were in his mind. He did it for you. It's been about you all the way from the beginning because it's a love story that he's expressing. Oh, it's the grace of God, the favor of God. This message breaks that amnesia and it begins to identify a people. You say, "Well, what kind of identification are we talking about? How do we how do we know if it's if it's my name that's calling?" &gt;&gt; Well, you know, we could know that eagle, &gt;&gt; there was a scream that went out. There was a voice that cried out, Other people ran, other people hid, other people left. But there was something inside of him. He didn't manufacture it. He didn't put it there. But from the beginning, he was an eagle. And that voice inside of him cried out and said, "I recognize that voice. I identify with that voice. That's calling my name. It's identifying that I was a son of God before the foundations of the world. It's identifying who I am." And it began to respond to that call. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, prophet of God says, "Now, what are we going to do when all we get that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions, the same things that he did, making the word manifest." &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, "If the church only knew its position, it will one day." &gt;&gt; What day are we talking about? This day, this scripture is fulfilled. We're not wondering if we're some little Pentecostal chicken. We have been identified. We know our position in the word. We know our position under the message of the hour. And we're standing in that position. We've got our seat. We got our ticket. We've got our token. We're just awaiting for that power to raise us to the skies. &gt;&gt; And I say, you know, like they say on the plane, everybody get in your seat cuz the rest of us are ready to fly. Oh, he says that church will know its position one day. He says they then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, did the message of the hour call your name? &gt;&gt; Did it identify you personally? &gt;&gt; Oh, the prophet of God, he says this, after you've recognized the very word of God was eagle food, then you left the other thing. You have been formed into the living image of the living God. You heard from your theophony and if this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting. I've already heard from my eternal body across the the the dimension of time. I have heard from my theophony. You say, "What are you talking about?" I'm talking about the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about something that I heard and it resonated on the inside of me and I just looked at it and I said, "Mama, that's me." Oh, the prophet of God says just like that little eagle when he heard the bridegroom's voice. &gt;&gt; You see that eagle scream, that message of the hour, it was not the voice of a man. It was not the voice of a Kentucky hillbilly. It was the voice of the bridegroom speaking to you. And he says when he heard the bridegroom's voice, he went to it, the anointed, vindicated word of God for the last day. Oh, and this message has identified you not as a a denominational chicken food feeder, but it's identified you not as a church, but as the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; it's a glorious thing to recognize and submit to the identification that God has placed on you in this hour as the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; No. How can you be a sinner and a redeemed at the same time? &gt;&gt; How could you do it? How could you be? Prophet of God says, "How can you be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop at the same time?" &gt;&gt; How can it be? He says, "How can you be a sinner and a saint?" &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, he has redeemed us by his blood." How can you be a sinner and redeemed at the same time? No. You see, a s a child of God, he says, "Those that are born of God cannot sin. Oh, he says he says here another place. He says there's not a man, no angel, no nothing, not even God himself can forgive you for your sins. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Jesus did it at the cross. But it'll never prosper you anything or profit you anything until you accept it. &gt;&gt; Romans 4:6 says, "Even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputth righteousness without works, &gt;&gt; saying, "Blessed are those are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin." Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's grace. &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God that's on this bride of Jesus Christ. I don't care how many times she might fall on her face. I don't care how many times she might feel like she didn't do it right and she messed it up. God don't even put it on the record. He does not impute sin to this bride cuz she has come underneath his grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, that rapturing grace that's been unleashed in this hour. You know, you look at the parallel. You look at Abraham and Sarah and how they received that visitation of the son of man which came to them and began to discern the thoughts and intents of their heart which we have seen in our day. We have seen that same visitation of the son of man and he called by name Abraham. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Called him by name knew his name. Knew he had a new identity. Abraham Sarah. He called them. He identified them. And he began to speak that the promise &gt;&gt; that had been sitting there for years and years and years, he began to say, "This is the hour. This is the time. This is the day for the fulfillment of the prophecy." &gt;&gt; And you know what, Sarah, she'd woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says she was all fussy and and she was in a bad attitude and and she was going on and and causing, you know, stirring the pot at the house there. &gt;&gt; Kind of fussy that morning. The prophet of God said it was the devil trying to block the visitation that was already on the road. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, you know it doesn't matter. You say, "Well, I've had a lot of things going on. It's been really getting dark. It's really been getting hard. There's been a lot of struggles lately." That's just the devil trying to block the visitation that God is coming to your place. He's coming your way. Don't you get worked up over it. Don't you get worried about it. He is coming to your situation. He is coming to fulfill the promise that he said he would do. &gt;&gt; And there she was all in a bad mood, all fussy, all out of sorts. And the angel of the Lord comes up and Abraham runs out and she's like, "Well, how many fanatics is my husband going to entertain today?" And and he runs, he's like, "Sarah, this might be our day of visitation." I I really think it is. &gt;&gt; And she said, "You've been saying that for years." &gt;&gt; Yeah. We've been talking about a rapture. We've been talking about it for a long time, &gt;&gt; but we've received the visitation. &gt;&gt; Oh, and you know, she was there and and God began to speak and she called God a liar to his face. &gt;&gt; And you know what? God would have killed her right there. &gt;&gt; She He would have just taken her right out of the picture. Come on. &gt;&gt; But he couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, and and the prophet of God says because God could not kill Sarah. He ha because he'd have to take Abraham and Sarah was a part of Abraham. They were in a union. And to take the church and destroy it. He can't do it because it's a part of himself. Christ part of himself. The word being made flesh. Oh, amazing grace. How sweet the sound. Couldn't do it. You get it? He couldn't kill her. He couldn't take her life because she was part of Abraham and she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone. In our mistakes, don't say, "Well, I I made a failure." No. Abraham made failures, too. But he couldn't take the church. He couldn't kill the elected. He couldn't take your life because you're part of himself. You're the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it was up to us and our mistakes and our failures, surely we would deserve death. Absolutely. But we're a part of the prophecy. We're a part of the promise. We are a part of the word. We are the word made flesh in this day. And not our good works, not our ability, but the elective grace of God placed upon this bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, &gt;&gt; the prophet of God says after the visitation, &gt;&gt; he says, he says, the next morning, his shoulders began to straighten up &gt;&gt; and the hump began to come out of his back. Her hair began to turn. They went back to young men and women just showing what he's going to do. The royal seed of Abraham to be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of eye, to be caught up together. And I want you to see this. the day before. She's over there in a bad mood. She's over there all fussy. She's over there just causing trouble in the church. She's over there all working things up. And she's even got problems in her heart of doubt and and how could it be me and I don't see this? But because she was a part of the prophecy, the prophet told us multiple times, he says after that visitation, the next morning, Abraham looked over and Sarah was turning young again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The rapture taking place the day after you woke up with a bad attitude. &gt;&gt; It's not about you. It's his word. It's his promise. It's his prophecy. Get your eyes off yourself and look at the word. Look at the prophecy. Look at the promise. His word will never fail. Heavens and earth will pass away, but that word will not fail. There will be a bride. She'll be without spot and without wrinkle. There will be a bride. Oh, my heart jumps for joy to know that there will be a bride again in this last day. &gt;&gt; Oh, if the musicians would come. &gt;&gt; Rapturing grace is not coming. &gt;&gt; It's here. &gt;&gt; We've received the visitation, friends. We've received the visitation of the son of man. I'm not looking for another day. I'm not looking for another age because I know that after that visitation, it was the very next morning that their bodies were changed. And so I'm not looking for another messenger. I'm not looking for another message. I have received everything that I have need of for the changing of this mortal body. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just stand to our feet. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Couple months ago, I went down to Honduras and went way back in there. You know, I grew up up in the mountains in Arizona. And our favorite thing to do was to hike up in the mountains and hunt rattlesnakes and rabbits for food and just live off the land. And you know, and that was a part of God's purpose for my life because I've had the opportunity now to go out to these areas and they don't have running water. They don't have electricity. They don't have a bed to sleep on. And I'm actually I'm happy to be there. And I went there and you know they don't have running water so the bathroom if they have one, it's just an outhouse. and they go and they dig a great big pit and they they put a little shed over top of it and that's your that's your bathroom and they don't smell too good. They're pretty awful places. And one morning I got up and went down to the outhouse and getting up close to it and kind of calling out, "Hey, anybody home?" You know, and I hear these really weird noises coming out of the outhouse and I'm just like, "What's going on?" you know, and I go up in there and I look around and I look down in the down in the water down there. Well, water. I look down in there and there's a pig. He's just swimming around. Swimming around in all the sewage, you know. And you know, when he when he hopped in there, I mean, he was a happy pig. He jumped in there. I mean, it was everything he could have ever wanted. But you know, when I found him, he was drowning. He was going down under those water and struggling back up, trying to climb out. He couldn't get out. Walls were too high. And he's he's down there drowning in that filth. It just it burdened me. I I wanted to help him, but but you know, I I I like bacon. I enjoy bacon, but not that much cuz I mean, there was just there's only a little hole there, you know, and trying to get down and pull them out of I I just walked away. I just It bothered me and I just I had to leave. And I went up and told them up at the little hut up there. I'm like, "Hey guys, pig in the toilet." You know, like, and they just kind of laughed at me and it's like, "Oh, you know, goofy American, you know, he doesn't know how it works out here or something. I don't know. I couldn't understand it, you know." But I began to think about it cuz one time I was in that hole. &gt;&gt; One time I was down in the pit. You see, I I wasn't going to get that pig because to get that pig, I'd have to get dirty with him. &gt;&gt; But when I was in the pit, &gt;&gt; there was somebody that came &gt;&gt; and he became sin for me. &gt;&gt; That he might reach in and pull me out [Music] &gt;&gt; and he pulled me out of that. Why would he do it? I'm not worth anything more than just a pig. There's nothing about me that's good. But you see, he had grace on me. And his love was so great. He came and he redeemed me and he took me out of the pit. And then he cleansed me by the washing of the water of the word. He purified me with his blood. And then he set his elective grace on me to be his bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a grace that would come and would redeem us and call us. It wasn't when we were good, but while we were yet dead in sin. &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy &gt;&gt; came and redeemed me. [Music] Oh, it's the grace of God that has reached out his hand and taken us the beggars off of the dung hill and set us into the palace as a princess. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, just worship him this morning. Oh, give him your love and your appreciation. For there was no good thing in any man, but his love, his grace was so great, it came down to redeem us. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How we thank you. If not for &gt;&gt; goody [Music] through lives of love [Music] or reject Give him [Music] lift up for grace. Amazing grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; How sweet. I was lost, but now I'm found. [Music] Give me the praise. Give God the grace. Amazing grace. How sweet this sound [Music] [Applause] [Music] for grace. Where would I be? &gt;&gt; Where would I be? You only know from my soul [Music] praise. [Music] You are the one that you see. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Through eyes of love, a hopeless case, an empty place. [Music] What a wonderful grace. What a wonderful grace. [Music] If there's someone here that doesn't have that assurance in your heart, why don't you take that assurance today? Why don't you let him give you that assurance in your heart? &gt;&gt; He can give you the token. It's a reality, friends. The presence of the Lord that you feel in this building can so make your heart know that you are his &gt;&gt; and that you will be there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've still got time. If there's someone here that wants to give your life to the Lord, maybe maybe you've never given your life to the Lord. You want these brothers to pray with you. &gt;&gt; You're welcome. If you need the baptism of the Holy Spirit, why why not just accept it right where you are? Accept God's grace upon your life. &gt;&gt; It's his love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's his grace upon you. Oh, bless the name of the Lord. I see tears all over the building. It's God here confirming his word to you. Not that you have to cry, but there's something about your soul. There is a there is a revelation. It's the Holy Spirit coming in an invisible union making this word live. Come off of the pages in your heart on your life. &gt;&gt; Bless the name of Jesus. A hopeless case, [Music] an empty place. If not amazing grace, how sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found. A hope is an empty place. If not, oh, let's sing it again. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. I once was lost. Hallelujah. But now I'm found. I was a hopeless case, an empty case if not for grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you love him? Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. [Music] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh an empty place. [Music] No one knew how alone I was &gt;&gt; at the emptiness. I tried so hard to hide. &gt;&gt; No, I laughed and said fine without you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I was covering up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I didn't waste [Music] of mercy. And the love you show [Music] you. &gt;&gt; Oh glory and purchase my redemption when you broke his power. You set my spirit free [Music] [Applause] without you. Jesus, I'm amazed. I'm amazed how you can through your grace. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. And my sins, &gt;&gt; all my sins are &gt;&gt; washed away. &gt;&gt; All my sins are washed away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true. There's been days when I &gt;&gt; Lord, you go the time I've gone astray. Lord, I learn your love stronger than my weakness. And your ears are &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. What a loving God. &gt;&gt; No one else, &gt;&gt; no one else has ever cared for me &gt;&gt; like you, Lord. No other friend, &gt;&gt; no other friend so close to me. Oh, &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid of tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Knowing you for everything, &gt;&gt; everything I ever need. I'm amazed. I'm amazed. You love me, &gt;&gt; Jesus. I believe you. &gt;&gt; How you care? Through your precious, &gt;&gt; your precious blood, I found part. When my sins are washed, &gt;&gt; they're all washed. Washed away.

[Music] &gt;&gt; What a revelation. &gt;&gt; That's what God has wanted in this day. This is the rapturing time. And that's why God He would always send a prophet right at the junctions of time. He always sent those messengers to come. He had to have a Noah to make sure that there was a people prepared. Get ready now. I'm fixing to do something. He had to send a Moses. Get ready. I'm fixing to do something. You'll miss it if if you don't really catch who you are and what I'm doing. He's always had the junctions of time and he always has that messenger to say, "Don't get caught up. Hey, get your eyes off everything else. I've got a purpose for you." &gt;&gt; And God is saying in this day, listen, don't get caught up in the world affairs, wars. Don't get caught up in Democrat, Republican affairs. Don't get caught up in these that that's not who you are. You're my bride. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes single. Keep your eye on me. No, no spiritual adultery, flirting with this and that and the other.
