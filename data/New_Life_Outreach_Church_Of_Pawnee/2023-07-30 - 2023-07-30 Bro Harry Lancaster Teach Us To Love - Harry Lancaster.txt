lips Lord Lord I pray that you would touch the ears of the ears Lord touch their hearts to understand and Lord may you just minister to the needs of your people Lord Lord we just we love you Lord and commit the service into your hands the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 13. I know this is going to be one of the most recognized sections of scripture I know as a a home school kid we every single year had a group of us that would memorize First Corinthians 13 with different hand motions to go with it they never did King James version though you always had to do a slightly different version to make it fit right I guess but we'll start at First Corinthians chapter 13 we'll just start at verse 1. though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol you know what let's let's read this uh responsively back and forth so I'm going to have you all read verse two and we'll go ahead and go right through down to verse 13 so I'll read verse one again and then y'all can read verse two and we'll go from there though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol s and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing in this time not itself is not but uh Charities suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charityth vaunteth not itself is not puffed up rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth oh because charity never faileth but where there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall cease where there be knowledge it shall vanish away but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away I believe for now we see through a glass darkling but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as also I am known by this faith hope charity these three are the greatest of these is Charity you can have your seats and this is I know that that uh probably felt like we were back in Sunday school and once again this is just something that was one of my Sunday school lessons that's kind of developed since then but um brother random said in the sermon in 1954 the seven Church ages said now John being old they are told by historians that he was brought to the church to preach and he was so old the only thing he would say was little children love one another I tell you that's a very good thing to preach on little children love one another as I get old in the ministry now and about in my 21st year I think all the time as I go along that the more I think of the Lord Jesus the more I begin to find out that it's love that covers the whole thing the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit and in uh also in in 1954 and we would see Jesus he says the thing of it is Friends the human mind today without the inspiration of the Holy Ghost don't know what compassion means neither do you know what love means look at First Corinthians 13 how would you interpret First Corinthians 13 as love though I have all these fine gifts Paul said though I give my body to be burned a sacrifice for the Lord Jesus Christ though I give all my goods to feed the poor in everything isn't that love but that's not Bible love see you're talking about natural affection instead of divine revelation of the will of God brother Wendell uh as he has mentioned before preaches on love a lot and so I feel weird being the one to get up and now be the one ministering on it but um he actually mentioned just in the uh service on uh this past Wednesday night he mentioned um the different Greek words for love and he didn't go into them but I wanted to to touch on those just for a moment so the four biblical Greek words for love um the first one that's used uh is Eros which is used for sensual or romantic love um it's a love that is normally felt physically with within the body you then have philia love or deep friendship it's often referred to as a deep camaraderie friendship that's developed between Brothers in Arms who had fought side by side on the battlefield it's it's the most General type of love in the scriptures it's encompassing the love for fellow humans care respect and compassion for people in need there's then uh storage which is family relationships it's it's family love the the affectionate bond that develops naturally between parents and children and and brothers and sisters and then you have uh the one that we're in a lot of ways we talk about the most but agape love the the selfless unconditional love God's Own love it's the love of supreme greatness this term defines God's immeasurable incomparable love for humankind it's the Divine love that comes from God agape love is perfect unconditional sacrificial and pure you know in some ways I think that uh obviously the Greeks had a little bit better handle of love than we do because nowadays the word love has become so common and so cheap you know when with the Greeks having multiple words for it they could make it very clear of what they were talking about where we just use the word love to blanket everything and so um as as brother Wendell uh mentioned the other night you know they can say I love pizza I love the new app on my phone I uh I love this or I love that teenagers and young people in the world are are quick to declare their undying love before they really know anything about each other um you know when I was growing up and I mentioned this to brother Wendell the other night my mom and dad drilled into me and thoughts at me that you don't tell a young woman I couldn't tell a young woman that I loved her until I was ready to put a ring on her finger until I was ready to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her there was no mentioning that I loved her that wasn't on the table in any way and that's one of those where if you looked at it from this Greek perspective of having these multiple words for it you could very clearly go well yeah I love pizza I use this word to go for pizzas this is what I enjoy eating great that makes sense now I don't think that you want to go marry Pizza it's very very simple but so when we're looking at First Corinthians 13 when it's using the word charity that is the Greek word agape and so this whole chapter is talking about agape love and so to be very clear as we go into this and talk about it we're not touching on the other three First Corinthians 13 is just about agape love it's about God's Own love that perfect selfless unconditional love brother Brandon said in the sermon Jehovah Jireh he said someone said to me not long ago said brother Branham now you know you was a good Baptist I said I still feel that but I've raised up a little higher he said well now look said Abraham believed God and was imputed to him for righteousness how much more could Abraham do but believe he said when we believe God we receive the Holy Spirit I said how different from Saint Paul Saint Paul said in Acts 19 have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed not when you believed since he said well Abraham believed God that's all he could do I said true but then God give him the order of circumcision as a confirmation that he had received his faith and if he had never circumcised you yet by the Holy Ghost he hasn't received your faith yet that's right that is the circumcision of the heart and spirit God gives the Holy Ghost as a confirmation he has received your faith now if you stop believing and scrambling around and just believe God God will circumcise that heart and that cuts off all unbelief circumcise the world and all unbelief away from you and then you stand the word alone Jesus said if he invited me in my word in you then ask what you will it'll be given to you that's what's the matter with the church today it's under emotion it's under education it's under Creed no wonder it's smothered down sea so we need a circumcision to cut the whole thing away come back to God in his word and believe it the way it's wrote there and don't argue with it just stay with it God made a promise God keeps his promise he can't do nothing else but keep his promise and remain God let's see turn to Deuteronomy chapter 30. and verse 5 will start at and at first glance I'm sure this seems really weird okay he was talking about agape love and now suddenly we're on circumcision where where are we going with this so we go in Deuteronomy chapter 30 and it's starting at verse 5 it says and the Lord thy God will bring thee into land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do the good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live and the Lord thy God will put these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord and do all his Commandments which I command thee this day let's go back up to verse 6 again and the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart so in order to love the Lord thy God there has to be a circumcision there has to be a cutting away we can't love God until this something has been removed they're tied right together this is these are commas that are in here this is all carried together as one sentence that in order for you to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul the Lord thy God has to circumcise thine heart which means he has to cut something away he has to begin to clear away so that you can love me correctly so as you know circumcision we know as a type of the Holy Ghost but the random laid that out very clearly and so the Holy Ghost is required to love the Lord with all our heart there has to be a cutting away of the excess and as God teaches us how to love more and more will be removed as we surrender and he teaches a little bit more there'll be a little more cutting away a little bit more cutting away so that we can love him the way that we're supposed to now as we go into First Corinthians 13 and we're going to be taking this piece by piece and we'll starting at verse 4 charity suffereth long to change that into Modern English love is patient now patient just the definition of patient I can probably spend the whole sermon on just this but patient means able to accept or tolerate delays problems or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious we could park here for a while without becoming annoyed or anxious I'll be quick to say I don't measure up all the time to say love is patient which means I can accept the delays the problems or the suffering without being anxious or annoyed we live in a world that's full of anxiety we live in a world where everyone is anxious about something or upset about something or upset about what's going on the very first thing as Paul's writing about it and talking about love he says charity suffers long love is patient first one he lists before we get into anything else it's you have to be able to take what sent it you without being anxious without being annoyed without being upset Romans chapter 8 verse 18 says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US we're able to take the sufferings without the anxiety that that cripples the world the world always gets upset when they're going through a hard time when money starts to get a little bit tight when they've got some sort of sickness when they've got some sort of issue that's risen up they're immediately going to get anxious and worried and concerned but yet the first thing that Paul writes goes if you have love if you have Agape perfect love you're not anxious you're not annoyed you're not upset you're able to maintain that calm and peace through it all brother Brandon said in the sermon the seed does not air with the shock he says how will you know how will the world know that you love Jesus when we love one another that's how the world see God sees your faith the world sees your action love one another now be kind one to another talk with one another be patient with one another so back First Corinthians chapter 13 verse 4 the next one is and is kind so love is kind kind is having or showing a friendly generous and considerate nature so first off we have peace we don't get upset and annoyed by what's going on next we're kind we're we're thinking about those around us we're wanting to treat them well and sometimes that means giving correction in kindness giving correction In Love sometimes it's telling them the truth and love is part of being kind being kind doesn't mean we're always trying to protect everyone's feelings being kind is thinking of what's best for them treating those around us with what is best for them at that time next in verse 4 it says charityth envieth not so love does not envy Envy is a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions qualities or blessings love doesn't have the desire to have what someone else has to to wear oh man I just wish I could sing as good as this brother or sister or that I could play the instruments as well or that I could preach as well as this person or that I could do this or that I could do that and this might be something that is in one way good to be desirous of you know we're not going hey I wish I had that much money I wish I had that much object you know these objects or physical things going I just wish that I could sing like that to worship God I wish I had a voice like that but then we have to remind ourselves God didn't say you had to sing well he said A Joyful Noise so that means if you don't sing well it's still okay he didn't say we had to be able to play every single instrument out there he didn't say that we had to be able to do this or do that I don't have to be able to be the fire and brimstone preacher like brother Josh or like someone else that's not my calling and that's okay I don't have to be like this one or like that one other people don't have to try to be like me God's made each one of us and so God tells us if you have this perfect love you're not envious you're not trying to be what you're not you're not trying to get what's not yours you're comfortable and you're satisfied with where God has placed you and what he's doing with you brother Brandon said in the sermon that God had explained he says and no matter what we do how many miracles we can perform how many mountains we can move or whatever it is until we can come to a place that we love not make belief but we love one another when we love every brother no matter what church he belongs to we love him not just pretend we do because we know it's a religious idea we're supposed to do it but because we do it we love one another then long-suffering bearing with one another and I believe in Colossians 3 about 9 somewhere along there I might have might be wrong in the scripture but it said after we become Christians we should not envy see we can't have faith when we're trying to pay respects and honor to one another see we can't do that we can't have faith we've got to honor God see honor him believe in in my brother sure is love but the respects and dignity goes to God but have faith and confidence in one another and don't lie to another see don't lie to one another if I tell you this morning I love you I must mean that if it doesn't I'm a hypocrite that's exactly next the scripture tells us that charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up so love is not prideful pride is a feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction that is derived from one's own achievements the achievement of those with whom one is closely associated or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired we're not supposed to be proud of what we have or what we can do or any of those kind of things because we all know that it's just given to us by God it's what's entrusted to us just like I'm not envying someone for the gift they have I shouldn't be proud because of the gift that I have brother Josh has a calling as an evangelist he travels around and preaches I shouldn't envy that and want to go like he does and he shouldn't be taking pride in the fact that hey I get to go to all these places and they invite me to preach here and preach there sorry brother Josh you're getting picked on tonight we have different types of callings and we should both be comfortable and happy in the callings that we're in I was called to be in this type of ministry I which fit well with then having the role of the deacon where my heart's at home this is where I want to be I'm not interested in traveling a whole lot brother Josh doesn't fit the role of the deacon because that's not where his heart is his heart is to go out and evangelize because that's the calling on his life this is the way God has made each one of us to work with in the body to each have their part that they play and work with it and so it's not that I'm envying what he has it's not that I'm being prideful of what I have it's that we just love each other as brothers and we support each other and we're there for each other the way that we're supposed to Proverbs chapter 29 and verse 23 it says a man's Pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit as we go into verse 5 in First Corinthians 13 it says it doth not behave itself unseemly love is in order or love is modest is another way to say it unseemly is behavior or action that is not proper or appropriate so when we have this love we are going to act in the correct manner we're going to carry ourselves in the right manner when the way that we present ourselves not just physically although it does carry into that if I'm manifesting this and I'm working in the modest manner it's going to reflect in my clothing it's going to reflect in the way that I act but it's also going to affect in my attitude it's going to affect it's going to manifest itself in the way that I speak to others it's going to be manifest itself in the way that I interact with my brothers and sisters it's gonna interact it's going to be in the way that I interact with the world when I'm out on the job side and the way that I carry myself I'm going to be carrying myself with a matter with a some decorum and being in an order in a certain way because this is what we've been called for we have been called to be the the diplomats and the emissaries here on Earth for a kingdom that's not on this Earth and so we are carrying ourselves as representatives of that Kingdom we have to carry ourselves in order you know some of the biggest scandals that you'll occasionally read of in the newspaper is when someone from another country is here in the U.S or someone from the US is in another country and they behave themselves in an improper Manner and they end up getting arrested or they end up being splashed all over the tabloids or whatever because they did not model a behavior that would actually make their country look good they came off and they were not a good Emissary they were not a good role model for that country to go oh yeah I want to go visit England now because of how they carried themselves or France or Belgium or take your pick or them saying I want to go visit the U.S because of how good the U.S tourists are U.S tourists have some of the worst reputations in the world they're not good at setting an example they are not good at carrying themselves in order Ephesians chapter 4 verse 1 says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace we're called to act a certain way we're called to present ourselves in a certain way and as the love of God begins to manifest in us more and more some of those attitudes and some of those desires and some of those things begin to be cut away and pushed off because now we're carrying ourselves because we have a certain office I am a representative of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ and so as such I have to act a certain way I have to talk a certain way because everything I do reflects back on my Lord next it says that it's seeketh not her own love does not seek after its own pleasure love is selfless this is where we're talking about we're talking about agape love we're talking about that perfect Selfless Love and so Paul lays it out very clear just says it doesn't seek after its own desires after its own wants it's selfless it's only thinking about about those around it John Wesley made the the following comments on Selfless Love he said it's seeketh not her own ease pleasure honor or temporal Advantage nay sometimes the lover of mankind seeketh not in some sense even his own spiritual Advantage it does not think of himself so long as Zeal for the glory of God and The Souls of men swallows him up brother random sit in the sermon that day on Calvary he said Jesus said and spoke of it let me just give you a few quotations on it listen close don't miss it Jesus said it that day he would separate the people like the sheep and the goats and he would say to the goat stand on the left side into the Sheep stand on the right and he said to the goats depart for me because I was hungry and you didn't feed me I was in prison and you did not visit me I was naked and you clothed me not I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was sick and you didn't visit me so depart from me and on the sheep he said I was hungry and you fed me I was naked and you give me clothing I was sick and you ministered to me and notice don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever it was so unconsciously done the people didn't do it for line of duty a man that gives you something another because he ought to do it a man that feeds you because he ought to do it he's got a selfish idea it should be your very life your very action it was so surprising to these sheep that they said Lord when were you hungry and we when were you naked and we give you clothes when were you thirsty and we give you drink when were you sick and we ministered to you it was so automatically out of love just your life lived in them God let the people see what Calvary did for us so automatically when were you Lord we never knew that Look what Jesus turned and said in so much of you done unto these you did it unto me unselfish life not the second thought not to think about it but you are so dead to the things of this world and so in life in Christ and so walking on the highway that these things are just an automatic thing you just do it not saying well now the Lord would Lord would want me to do that it's not that you're just part of him his spirit is in you and you act the way he acted do you get it goes on and says that love charity is not easily provoked which means love does not anger easily now provoke is to stimulate or incite someone to do or feel something especially by arousing anger in them love is not easily provoked it doesn't say it's never provoked let's put that little caveat there it's not to say it's never that you can never be taken to the point where you finally react but it's not easy you don't have a hair Drinker temporary this isn't something that goes off at the drop of a hat it ties into that patience it ties into the fact that you can keep taking it and you don't get annoyed annoyance leads to anger if you don't get annoyed then the anger is going to be far away it's going to take a long time to get there so when you're patient the not angering easily goes hand in hand it goes right with it yet thinketh no evil pretty straightforward love doesn't think evil thoughts whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things when we have that perfect love this is where our mind stays we stay on the things of God we stay on the things that are holy and righteous and upright so we're not thinking about the evil things it says going into verse six rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth so love doesn't rejoice in evil we rejoice in the things that are good we rejoice in the things that are upright we don't look at the things that are going on around us and when something bad happens think that it's funny or think that it's amusing or think that it's whatever think that it's something that's entertaining the same place it goes back to we don't think about the evil things well if I'm being entertained by the evil then I'm thinking about the evil if I'm allowing myself to rejoice in the evil then obviously I'm thinking about it but if I'm keeping myself from thinking about the evil and I'm thinking about the good things I'm not going to be rejoicing in the evil first Peter chapter 4 starting at verse 7 it says but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins use Hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man Minister let them do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and Dominion forever and ever amen that verse 8 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for Charities shall cover the multitude of sins going into verse 7 we've got a lot of things grouped together really fast beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things beareth all things we take whatever is thrown at us with God's strength we're able to Bear it we're able to keep going we're able to keep pressing you're able to keep walking not because of my strength not because of your strength but because you have God strengthening you to keep pressing on to keep going forward believeth all things now that doesn't mean that we believe every single thing we read on the internet it doesn't mean we believe every conspiracy theory that's out there that's what not what he's describing when he says love believes all things perfect love believes the perfect word agape love leads you back to the perfect word and so we have that perfect faith in it to believe every word that's here we don't question it we don't have the doubt behind it we're able to believe what God said because the very love and life that's within us comes from God and so we are not going to doubt what he said love endures all things ties in with barith all things we can keep pressing forward we can keep enduring the trials that are sent to us because God's giving us the strength to do it God's giving us the perfect love to face it so that we're not getting upset we have the patience to go through the trial we have the patience to Bear the test to Bear the burden we have the patience to be able to endure I skipped one there hope with all things and then in the end it says charity never faileth so the charity this perfect agape love never fails this isn't going with the English word of yeah love never fails well which love let's be very this is the Agape perfect love of God never fails if I'm loving you with a different type of love it can fail I can come up short I can get angry I can get upset but when we're going with that perfect love that perfect love of God it cannot fail Galatians chapter six starting at verse 1. Brethren if a man be overtaken in Fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted burying one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another bear one another's burdens yes love beareth all things and we come into as a body help one another to go they're going through a hard time they're going through a trial they're starting to to dip under the weight a little bit we can come in and lift them up in prayer we can come in and be there to talk to them to encourage them to love them to share that perfect love of God with each other to help bear that burden so they're not feeling alone yes God gives us the strength for each one but sometimes he sends that strength through our brothers and sisters sometimes he just sends it to you as you're reading the word or you're praying but sometimes it's a brother or sister that comes and talks to you sends you a text or gives you a call or stops fire for a surprise visit or whatever it might be that brother or sister that maybe has been there before they've dealt with the same kind of issue and they're able to come in and talk to you about this is how God got me through I'm going to help you bear this burden because I've been there I've done it and even if I haven't been there I still love you and I'm here for you to encourage you and stand by you in the midst of whatever trial you're facing brother banham said and the word became flesh he says what kind of people would it be this morning if this Branham Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why when you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't have no ultimony of your own but just to be led by the spirit and they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church and its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material that's when the church is in its power I believe it's on the road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind sow away from their cells that they don't see themselves they don't have no but to serve God and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind our thoughts run different a lot of times we walk up say how do you do brother and you don't meet it in your heart a lot of times we say I am this and that I'll do that you don't mean it in your heart see I don't mean it in my heart but when you can become so dead to the things of the world that Christ is first Christ is all then your entire makeup is of the spirit of Lord Jesus Christ he has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean your thoughts will be pure your heart your heart many people say well religion comes from your heart there is no mental facilities in that little being called heart you can't think with your heart the Bible said as a man thinketh in his heart so is it you can't think with your heart you can't because there's nothing mentally in there to think with Jesus wasn't speaking of the physical being he was speaking of the supernatural being right in the middle there when he talks about our thoughts run different a lot of times we walk up say how do you do brother and you don't mean it in your heart yeah how often do we do that we go up and we'll say hey how you doing today we don't want an answer we really don't want to know we just want you to go I'm good great I can keep on walking that's it you know how many times do we do that at work on the job side hey buddy how you doing today all I want to hear is good or great so I can keep walking I don't want an honest answer and on the flip side most of us if someone asks us that we don't want to give them the honest answer we would rather just say the good and that's it and we're done conversation is over we both feel like we've been nice to each other and we're moving on and yet brother Branham says that we have to mean it from the heart so when we're manifesting this agape love we're not we're not using this throwaway language that we're so used to I don't get to go up to brother John and just say how are you and not want an answer it's not the way it works if I ask the question I better be prepared because if I ask it I need to have some sincerity here to go I really want to know how are you I need to actually exactly like brother Wendler said I need to truly care about the person that I'm asking this to this isn't just something where I'm going well I want to be polite and so I'm just gonna say how you doing it's no I care about you because I have that perfect love where what's going on in your life matters is there something that you need to talk about is there something I can be praying about for you is there something that you need to share and maybe it's good you're on the Mountaintop and we're just going to praise the Lord for a minute about the blessings of God great we can do that too but I need to have that sincerity when I ask how are you doing that I'm ready for an answer and I'm ready to show that care based on whatever it is that you say whatever the situation is I'm ready to continue to show that love and that care charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail away whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge that shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as I also am known and now by the faith hope charity these three but the greatest greatest of these is Charity that agape love brother random said in the sermon getting in the spirit he said and that's what we've tried to do for two thousand years and Pentecostal people you're doing the same thing trying to pick him up by organization you'll never do it separating yourself from other brothers you've got to come back and we've got to be one I don't care if the man's wrong if he's wrong and sincere in his heart and you're right in your beliefs and you're wrong in acting the way you're acting I'd rather be in his place than yours that's right I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart God will respect it more so if a man is wrong what of it help him he needs help love him if you can't love your enemy the same as you love those who love you you're no better off than the publicans that's right that's what the churches failed to get I hope you get it tonight I hope you see what I'm talking about it's back to love redeeming love all the other things are fine but we got to come back to fellowship with one another and people said I fight organization I do not I fight that system in there that's breaking up Brotherhood I've always done it and I always will do it that's right I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart God will respect it more our Prophet told us that this isn't me as a minister standing up here and going you know God's going to respect your heart more this was the prophet saying if he's off in his Doctrine but he's right in his heart he's in a better place than the person that has all the doctrine lined up so if we don't have every single one of the seals laid out in our mind if I don't understand every single Church age if I don't understand every single mystery in Daniel or all these things take your pick of which Mysteries we're talking about my heart's right that's what's God paying attention to that's what God's going to respect is whether our heart is right and we're manifesting that love now if we're if our heart's right we're trusting that that Holy Spirit is going to start teaching us the teacher the holy spirit is going to start revealing those things to us if my heart's right if I'm in that place where I'm supposed to all right but this that's why we talk about the fact that this isn't some knowledge that we come to where we're able to with my learning be able to piece everything together and make it all fit just right because that part is the less important our Prophet told us the heart is what matters Are We There is the heart right do we have the right attitude are we caring for those around us are we showing the love of God the way that we're supposed to if we're off in the doctrine but the heart's right God will take care of straightening out the doctrine God will take care of teaching us sending a faithful Minister into our life to help train us to help teach us to help get us to where we're supposed to be but the first and foremost is is our heart where it's supposed to be are we showing the love of God that we're supposed to brother Branham said in the sermon questions and answers in 1962. he says I didn't come to this church tonight legally I feel tired I've been nervous I'm upset I'm wondering about something that's out before me my heart's burning even as much till my heart's fluttering I got cramp pain right at this minute just shooting back and forth up and down through here weak nervous trembly catch a hold here and squeeze me got my toes squeezed up in my shoes I felt anything but to come down here why did I come then because I love God live or die I must stand for him it's not because I have to he wouldn't care about whether I did it or not if I'd Die go to heaven anyhow but I'm coming because I love him you serve God because you love him not because you got to do it because you love him enough brother during I know that you've felt that a few times where you're going as you're sitting here at church going I don't feel like being here I don't feel like getting up and getting dressed to go church I don't feel like getting in the car and having to fight through every step to get here but yet you're here and you can I know that your Testament would be the exact same as brother branners we go because I love God I want to be there because I love him I want to be in his presence because I love him no matter what this physical body is doing no matter what symptoms may be trying to tell me and there are going to be times when the symptoms are bad enough you can't make it we all understand there are times the body falls far enough you can't make it but the desire is still there just like brother random said it's about the heart if that desire is still there I want to be in church but I'm parked over the commode throwing up I can't leave this thing God understands he knows your heart is to be in church but you can't get there safely okay God's paying attention to the heart God's paying attention to the desire your desire is to be in his presence your desire is to be there brother random continues in this quote he says I'm not true to my wife because I'm afraid she'd divorce me I'm true to her because I love her there's no other woman in the world but her that's the reason I'm true to her now if I'd done a mistake and they thought I did something wrong come to her say meet a honey I didn't mean to do that she'd forgive me for it I know she would I'd forgive her I love her I'd forgive her she'd forgive me but I wouldn't do it for nothing I love her too much to do it it isn't because I didn't think she would forgive me it's the idea that I love her too much to do it in the first place and as long as I love her like that I'll never do it and if she loves me the way she's supposed to she won't either and you love the Lord with all your heart you don't have to worry about these things if you make a mistake you don't sin willfully you just done something wrong see you slipped back true you was up here in Fellowship you dropped back down in the must down here again but you love the Lord with all your heart if you were sick at home and you couldn't make it to church the desire was still there to be in church it wasn't you started celebrating yes I've got a stuffy nose I don't have to go to church I can stay home and watch TV or I can stay home and do this on my computer do this no it's the desires are I want to be there I want to press through but the sickness is bad enough I can't right now or like when covet was going around okay I don't want I'm doing my best to keep from getting anyone else sick so I'm gonna pass by this time to protect the others my desire is still to be there I'm still going to be streaming the service I'm still gonna be doing this or doing that because my desire is to be in church my desire is to be there to worship and to be with my brothers and sisters John chapter 19. it's a little bit of lengthy reading but I want to get through a decent amount of Varsity so we're going to start at verse one then pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him and the soldiers plated a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe and said hail King of the Jews and they smote him with their hands pilot therefore went fourth again and saith unto him behold I bring him forth to you that you may know that I find no fault in him then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns in the purple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man when the chief priest there for and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them taking him and crucify him for I find no fault in him the Jews answered him we have a lawn by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of God when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid and went again into the Judgment Hall and saith unto Jesus whence art thou but Jesus gave him no answer then said pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee Jesus answered thou could us have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out saying if thou let this man go Thou Art not Caesar's friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the Judgment scene in a place that is called the pavement but in the Hebrew gabata and it was the preparation of the Passover and about the sixth hour and he said unto the Jews behold your king but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto him shall I crucify your king the chief priest answer and we have no King but Caesar then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took Jesus and led him away and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha where they crucified him and two others with him on either side one and Jesus in the midst and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the writing was Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews this title then read many of the Jews for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in Hebrew and Greek and Latin then said the chief Priests of the Jews the pilot right not the king of the Jews but that he said I am King of the Jews pilate answered what I have written I have written then the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every Soldier apart and also his coat now the coat was out was without seem woven from the top throughout they said therefore amongst themselves let us not Rend it but cast lots for it who's it shall be that the scriptures might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did castlots these things therefore the soldiers did now they're stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's Sister Mary the wife of cleophus and Mary Magdalene when Jesus therefore saw his mother and disciples standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman Behold thy son then saith he to the disciple Behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her into his own home after the this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst now there was a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished he bowed his head and gave up the ghost the Jews therefore because it was the preparation that the body should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day for the Sabbath day was in high day the sought pilot that the legs might be broken that they might be taken away then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they break not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water and he that saw it bear record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that he might believe for these things were done the scripture might be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken and again another scripture saith they shall look on him who they pierced Jesus wasn't feeling love while he went through the crucifixion he didn't have the warm fuzzy feeling that the world tries to tell you is love he wasn't sitting there just enamored with how everything was going it Isn't Love isn't what is shown in a Hallmark movie or some other Romance movie novel take your pick the greatest example of love that we have is Jesus giving his all taking our punishment enduring whippings thorns and crucifixion so that we could be redeemed back to our original state love that was able to endure suffering pain and humiliation in order to be back with the chosen bride this isn't what when if I were to just walk outside and ask a person describe to me love this is probably not what they're going to describe this is probably not what they're going to point to but yet this was the greatest example of love that could we could ever have when we go through and we start running through the scriptures on love Charities suffereth long he suffered the torment he kept taking it without opening his mouth is kind and envieth not it vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up Jesus had the right to call himself the greatest he had the right to be in that position he should have been the one sitting on the Judgment seat over Pilate but yet he was willing to be fully humbled to go fully down to the place of a servant to be the sacrifice it rejoices not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth it beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things everything that's described can be attributed to Jesus Christ there's nothing there that you would say well Jesus didn't do that he didn't do that no everything that's listed there as Paul goes through and describes the perfect agape love as he goes through and describes God's Own love Jesus Christ was the example he was the one that lived it out so it's not just this is a list of what you should be able to do no one's ever done it before but this is what the list would be of what perfect love is no this is the man on Earth that did it this is the man that lived it out that set the model for every one of us of we call ourselves Christians which is to be christ-like which means we're supposed to be manifesting the same thing as Christ we're manifesting that Same Love we're willing to sacrifice to give it all we're not going on our own desires we're not going on our own wants we're not going on what is best for us you couldn't say that what was best for Jesus in the human form was to be crucified you can't say that was the best choice for him personally but he was willing to give up all of his best choices because he was willing to love so perfectly and so completely to be the sacrifice and give up everything for his bride everything for his bride we as Christians looking at that in the way that we love the world for a lot of us married the way that we love our spouse are we able to sacrifice that completely are we able to give everything that completely for our sweetheart in the marriage of the Lamb brother random tells a story preached in 1962 he says let me tell you a little something that happened I'm a missionary as you know do Evangelistic missionary work and about seven times overseas around the world here not long ago in the city of Rome Rome is a great City for art and they had a school of art there and several of our American young folk go over there every year to take a year or two's training and art to learn to paint pictures there was a group of young Americans came over here a few years ago as the story was told me and when they get over there they just go Hog Wild when they're in Rome they do as Rome does they get out and drink and strip themselves and everything else and carry on both boys and girls and there was a certain School and in this school this group of young Americans come over and every one of them almost did the same thing but one certain little girl she wouldn't tolerate it at all she stayed in at night time she read while they were all out drinking daytime she worked study well she was the laughing stock of the whole school and she kept herself like a lady conducted herself like a lady although there were young Roman boys and everything around trying to get her to go out she refused it no sir she stayed right with her lessons learning to draw and to paint rather and she stayed with it finally an old custodian at the place kept watching her seeing she was so much different although he was a Roman Catholic kept watching her how she conducted herself one evening the young girl in the park where the studio was or the place where they had the school she walked out upon the campus and went up towards the top of the hill and the sun was setting and she was standing up there with her pretty clean face and her hair hanging down looking across that way toward the setting of the Sun the old custadian custodian was raking down there in the yard he kept watching the girl as he raped something just kept telling him go talk to her so he laid his rake down took off his old slouch hat walked up where the young lady was cleared his throat she turned around he said pardon me Miss she said yes certainly and he noticed she had been crying all the rest was out on a big spree for the night he said Madam I hope you understand me in the right way that I'm just going to speak to you said you've been here for most over two years now two years now I've noticed the group that you come with continually they're out on parties and coming in at all times of the night drunk close half off of them and everything but I noticed that you don't attend such parties I noticed that seemingly that you're always looking across the sea of an evening you walk up here and stand each evening and watch the Sun go down what causes that said I'm an old man and I'm curious of knowing what causes this difference between you and the others she said yes sir sir I'm looking towards home when the Sun is setting she said across beyond that sun Yonder is my homeland she said in that land there's a certain State and in that certain State there's a certain City in that certain city is a certain house and in that house is a certain boy said he too is an artist when I left to come over here I pledge my love to him we're engaged to one another and she said no matter what any of the rest of them does that has nothing to do with me she said I promise to live true and right she said I'm longing for the day when I feel myself on the top of the wings of the big planes that'll take me across the sea set me down at the airport where he'll meet me he's building a home and we'll live together in that land that's the reason I act the way I do I'm true to the promise that I made a boy and he's true to the promise that he makes me said I hear from him now and then and I write to him and said corresponding with one another we're still holding our vows waiting for the day we meet oh how that would do for a real question Christian to get away from the things of the world and someday you talk about coming to the port on the wings of a dove he's coming for a bride one that don't fool with the world or the things of the world she's washed in the blood of the Lamb she's pledged her love to him only the love of the world is gone and dead to her the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride hath made herself ready charity thinketh no evil we rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth she's not wrapped up in the things of the world she's not wrapped up in the desires of the world because her desires is for the one she's pledged to her desires is for the Savior that we've pledged ourselves to so we're not looking at the things of the world we're not looking at all the distractions all the Sparkles all the parties all the events that the world would want to try to draw you away to when Rana tried to pull you away to and and get you to give up that vow but our vow has been made to the one and we're just looking towards that day we're looking towards the day when we get to be back together once more Deuteronomy that we read earlier it said in the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul that thou mayest live Ezekiel chapter 36 starting at verse 25 says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you in heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them first Peter 4 and verse 8 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins brother Brandon said in the sermon it wasn't so from the beginning he said friends the whole world is dying for love that's one of the greatest things that we leave out of our Pentecostal blessings too much of it a love that mixes it together the mortar that makes gifts and all the things of God operate perfectly as love one for the other this will all men know that you're my disciples Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12 put on therefore is the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be thankful First Timothy chapter 1 and verse 5. now the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned and First Care First Corinthians chapter 13 ended with the verse and now Abide a faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity as the musicians go ahead and come in 1957 Hebrews chapter 2 brother Branham says sucker means to sympathize that's the reason he becomes this that he might be sympathetic with you who are who have your ups and downs and your little ins and outs and your Temptations get so great you can't hardly stand it he knows how to sympathize with you he he sets there to make intercession he sits there to love you and though you go astray he won't forsake you he will still come after you and knock at your heart there's not a backslider in the building but what no that God knocks at his heart daily and he will do it as long as you're Immortal on this Earth for he's loved you he redeemed you poets has tried authors is trying man is trying to express that theme of love and it cannot be found in human expression one said o love of God how rich and pure how fathomless and strong it shall be forever it shall forevermore endure Saints and Angels song if we would think the ocean fill and were the Skies of parchment made every stock on Earth and quill and every man ascribed by trade to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry nor could the scroll contain the whole the stretched from Sky to Sky you'll never understand there's no way for us to understand how that great sacrifice that he did came down and reconciled us back to God then he went back and said now I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come again and be with you even in you to the end of the world and in the sermon faith is the substance [Music] so Paul said it was possible for him to do those things without having the giver though I speak with tongues as men and angels and have not charity it profeth me nothing see all right now love one another above everything you do love one another and as you love one another you'll love God see you'll love each other and you'll love God for God is love and a man that walks in Love Walks In life and perfect love casteth out all fear then if you can take him in his word and not fear a bit about it say Lord I love you I know you're going to answer because you promised me you would and I just know you're going to do it see and it takes away all fear [Music] I know as I go through First Corinthians 13 and like I said it's something that I memorize as a kid year after year to be able to perform to The Homeschool Group and do these different things is it's scriptures that I've known for years but as I go through verse by verse and truly pay attention to what it's describing I can find the points that I don't quite measure up yet that I haven't gotten there yet that I can go okay Lord you said that in order for me to love you perfectly that you have to circumcise my heart as I read through First Corinthians 13 I can see some of the things that need to be circumcised that need to be cut away I need that Holy Spirit to be working so that I can love the way that I'm supposed to so that I can go beyond the other Greek definitions of love and I can say that my life manifests the agape the perfect love of God [Music] I'm not one to try to call out anyone else it's not my job to tell you this is what you've got to work on well Luke you got to work on your patience man you're just you're not there yet that's not my role my role is to point back to the scriptures my bowl role is to examine myself and go okay Lord this is what this is the word you've given me this is what you've laid out and this is the description and the example you've given of how I'm supposed to love [Music] Lord I can see where I'm not there yet and each one of us can take that time to examine and go okay this is what I need to work on maybe you are the most patient person in the world and that one doesn't affect you great praise the Lord I am so glad for you but what about all the other verses there's plenty there listed so if you can point to one and go I've got that one praise the Lord I'm not sure I can point the one and say I'm achieved it in any of them yet but I can definitely go through and start making it part of my prayer to go Lord this is what I'm supposed to be this is what you've laid out as the example this is what you've said is supposed to be in my life Lord I need you to be the circumcision I need your Holy Spirit to cut away what's not supposed to be there so that I can manifest the love that I'm supposed to let's go ahead and pray real quick Lord this has just been a simple sermon Lord It's Lord this is a section of scripture we have read year after year we have gone over it there are probably kids in Sunday school that could almost recite the entire chapter but Lord yet it's still some of the greatest instruction we have that this is the love of God that we're supposed to Manifest this is the love of God that's supposed to be showing in our lives Lord I pray that you would help me Lord that you would Lord you said that we have to be circumcised of the heart in order to love you the way that we should Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would do more of a work in me Lord that you would cut away the things that aren't supposed to be there Lord that you would help make me more like you Lord I know that's the prayer of my brothers and my sisters lohorten Lord I pray that you would just continue to work with each one of us so that we can manifest that love we can have our hearts right Lord so that we can be living before the world in the example that you would want us to or just accept our Praises through the remainder of the service Lord and Lord may you just be welcome to continue to minister to hearts Lord [Music] every day let's all stand [Music] I just want to show you I'm loving you more every day [Music] I'm loving anymore every day more every day [Music] the more I know you you I just want to shine every day and sing that one more time every day [Music] I just want to show you I'm loving [Music] oh Jesus said loving in you more yes I'm loving you more every day [Music] where you want to love him more [Music] how do you show your love to him he says how can you love me or love God whom you haven't seen when you can't love your brother whom you have seen amen so our love for him is expressed through our actions I think love is is an incredible this is should be our utmost goal love should be it should be our primary um goal here on the Earth amen put that chart up there sister kalila the the thing that God is looking for what what caps the pyramid love love love caps the pyramid what does love what does love rest upon what age are we in [Music] brotherly kindness that's that's where we are love should not even be a questioner in the church love should not be a question in our homes love shouldn't as I as I brought it out the other night amen the sacrificial love of the husband should is is she that that's that agape love that that love should be so expressed from the husband for his home that reverence that reverent love looking back to Christ and and loving him in in looking at him as I came from you should be expressed within all of you sisters in your home looking at your your husband [Music] have you ever have you ever done any any studies and and you've heard it you've heard it for years but if you've if you've listened to brother Branham he said the Capstone is charity that's that's the Capstone that covers it all if you get charity you you've got faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brother it's it's sealed in you he calls it the Holy Ghost he calls it the word age he calls it the bride age he calls it the word coming when brother Branham was pointing back to love he is he is tying it in with divine revelation he brings it all into that same thing so if our Revelation is not producing love then it's not the right revelation [Music] if our Revelation isn't willing if it's still demanding rights we haven't heard the message yet because when the revelation when that when that third pool Revelation comes he Christ which is nothing but love God Is Love Takes preeminence here the Revelation simply shows us it it unfolds the mystery of Christ the mystery of redemption it unfolds his love to us how I want to express that love Lord let me Express that love greater than I've ever expressed it can you say Amen you see what I'm talking about oh my the Capstone is has come now that's the stature of a perfect man that's that's that's that's that's that's you and your personal walk but brother Bradham uses that same if you go to Paul irenas Martin Colombo Luther Wesley Elijah connecting him with Ephesians all the way up to laodicea we're in that age and the word is coming down and he says it's got us that home age that's where God himself has to where he's coming down and he's fitting himself and making himself one with man do you love him here tonight Lord let me be an expression of Love let me be that expression help me Lord it's going to be a humble people it will foreign Amen Brother John said this morning about that Gene seed on the inside of you it's there it's there Lord let love let love live in me is that right why don't we sing that song as we as we get ready a flow through me [Music] oh maybe we ought to go down though floath through me [Music] Holy Spirit [Music] through me am I saying it right [Music] all through Holy Spirit flow through me [Music] as I lift my hats do worship and to magnify and blindly flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me [Music] flow through me oh flow through me foreign [Music] flow through me [Music] well the Capstone brother Wendell isn't that the Rapture are we not in the rapture it's the revealing it's God revealing himself letting his bride know what he's been doing and it's all wrapped up in l-o-v-e it's it's it's the mystery of what he's been doing all of these ages now he has as he descends he's come with a shout he's coming unveil himself what is he trying to do because he wants to unite with you he wants that Revelation to become part of us Lord oh God let me walk in love where are we going to be tried we're going to be tried in our love we're going to be tried that's where Satan is going to try Hallelujah but it's too late I'm already part of that rapture the Revelation is already arrested my heart I seen something in that Christ I've seen something in that word brother Branham brought up beautifully he says what has happened it was the bloody bleeding word who died for you oh God then he says and if you have the bloody bleeding word he says then you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ do you see the uniting and you say the rapture him love and you're rising in love and here before long we're going to be so connected that we will be caught away in the body change that is what we're striving for oh brother let's take this little this this message here to Heart tonight amen Lord let love live in me how many wants that I want it I want to express it I want to express it to my wife I want to express it to the church amen I want to express it in Every Which Way Hallelujah someone told me brother Wendell oh man I I I I had told him I said but in a situation I was saying you know but be merciful he's a merciful brother Wendell it's just there's got to come a time where I
