[30:59] Praise the Lord. Amen. God is so good to
[31:03] us. Let's look here in the in the book
[31:05] of Isaiah, the 59th chapter.
[31:09] We uh we've got two incredible
[31:13] um needs that we want to always keep
[31:17] before the Lord. And uh uh one of them
[31:22] is Brother Donald uh fixing to have open
[31:25] heart surgery this next Tuesday.
[31:28] and um um you know he's got he's got um
[31:34] they you know said that he's got heart
[31:36] disease
[31:38] and um which
[31:40] it's it's the walls of the heart from
[31:42] what I'm understanding the walls of the
[31:43] arteries that
[31:46] um get are hardened and infected and so
[31:51] it they they don't they don't work like
[31:54] they're supposed to which then it allows
[31:56] stuff to get stuck in there because it's
[31:58] It's not it's not the squeezing and the
[32:00] pumping and whatever it's supposed to be
[32:01] doing. And and um and so u part of that
[32:08] part of the reason for the surgery is
[32:10] coming right out of the heart is is is
[32:13] right there where that where that
[32:15] starts. And so they're you know it's
[32:18] it's going to be tedious them going in
[32:20] and replacing uh veins and things. And
[32:24] so, uh, he went in for his pre- opt
[32:27] today. And, um, uh, I haven't heard back
[32:31] how how he how he's doing, but I I want
[32:34] us just every day to be praying for
[32:35] Brother Donald when when you've when
[32:37] you've got such a long, uh, when you've
[32:40] got a week and a half or so that you're
[32:42] waiting, there just just so much
[32:43] emotions can go in your mind. And so,
[32:46] let let's let's be praying for him. And
[32:48] then, brother uh, Brother Gadman. Uh but
[32:51] brother Gadman's in is he's he's he's in

[33:01] going to cut out at least 10 inches of
[33:03] his intestines
[33:04] and and u but when they went back in
[33:07] there today all of his intestines is is
[33:10] is
[33:12] uh messed up. And so um so let's let's
[33:18] be praying for brother Gadman, you know,
[33:21] um it just this this this last year has
[33:24] been a year of sorrow for them. And um
[33:29] um brother Joseph and then we've we've

[33:35] had a little cancer taken off and then
[33:38] um you know, brother Gadman has just not
[33:41] been feeling well at all. And so I I
[33:43] want us to really let's enter in to the
[33:47] to the suffering of u of of of these of
[33:51] these brothers and sister. I I I tell
[33:53] you um and both of them, brother Donald,
[33:57] uh brother Gadman and Sister Gadman, the
[33:59] three of them are just some of the best
[34:01] people around. And so uh brother brother
[34:05] Gadman doesn't have his family uh
[34:07] nearby. You know, of course, Sister
[34:10] Stephanie's here and and that's rough on
[34:13] her and and um so, you know, um I just
[34:17] when when we go to the Lord in prayer, I
[34:19] I want us to take these needs before the
[34:21] Lord. And we're going to go to the Lord
[34:23] in prayer before we uh even uh read the
[34:27] scripture here tonight. So, let's pray.
[34:29] Father, I've just brought these two
[34:32] needs, Lord, that have been on my heart,
[34:34] Father, as as Lord, these these are uh
[34:40] great men, Father, Brother brother
[34:43] Donald, and and Brother Gadman, and
[34:46] their love for you is impeccable. Their
[34:50] desire to help your people is is seen by
[34:54] all. And Father, they're in their time
[34:57] of need. And I pray God that you would
[35:02] help them. Lord, I pray, Holy Spirit,
[35:06] that your anointing would would be right
[35:09] there with Brother Donald. Lord, you can
[35:11] even heal that heart disease right now,
[35:14] Lord, as he's listening to this service.
[35:17] Father, I I pray, Lord, that you would
[35:20] be with him and strengthen his faith and
[35:22] give him confidence, Lord. I pray,
[35:25] Father, that you would be with Brother
[35:27] Gadman, Father, and if he's listening,
[35:29] I'm asking that you would strengthen his
[35:32] faith, Lord, and that you would bring
[35:34] healing to that colon, that you'll raise
[35:37] him up, Father. Lord, he has suffered
[35:39] quite a bit this last year, and I I just
[35:42] pray that you would be with him, be with
[35:44] Sister Gadman, Lord, as she's recovering
[35:46] from pneumonia, and and Lord, the
[35:49] sicknesses that she's going through.
[35:51] just ask that you would be with them.
[35:54] Father, we just ask that you would take
[35:55] this portion of the service and that you
[35:57] would anoint your word to our heart. I
[36:00] ask Lord that you would remove every
[36:02] obstacle that would not be like you.
[36:05] Lord, take every sin, every everything
[36:07] and place it underneath your blood. Help
[36:10] us tonight, Lord, in the name of the
[36:12] Lord Jesus. Can the church say amen?
[36:16] And amen. God bless you. Let's look here
[36:19] at Isaiah 59 and1.
[36:23] It says, "Behold, the Lord's hand is not
[36:26] shortened that it should that it cannot
[36:29] save,
[36:31] neither his ear heavy that it cannot
[36:34] hear.
[36:36] But your iniquities have separated
[36:40] between you and your God, and your sins
[36:44] have hid his face from you that he will
[36:48] not hear. I want to minister this
[36:51] evening on the waters of separation. You
[36:53] can be seated.
[36:55] we
[36:57] as we uh think along uh this this line
[37:01] here for this evening uh Lord willing
[37:04] this next week we're going to we'll
[37:05] start back on the church age book now
[37:07] that everyone will be back home but I
[37:10] want to minister on the waters of
[37:14] separation and and I want us to
[37:16] understand the that sin
[37:20] is is should will not be tolerated by
[37:24] God and cannot be tolerated by us by any
[37:28] of us. There is no sin that that we
[37:32] should ever u put before God.
[37:37] And um because sin separates the
[37:42] believer from God. Amen. And and so we
[37:46] we don't want and and as we just read
[37:49] here, it's he's the God is just saying
[37:51] that it's not that the Lord's hand is
[37:53] short. And it's lot not that his ears
[37:56] are heavy. It is simply that we've
[37:59] allowed sin to come in and sin has
[38:03] separated. The communication is is is
[38:07] has been severed. And so it'll keep you
[38:10] from God's blessings. Amen. It'll keep a
[38:13] sinner from God's blessings. It'll keep
[38:16] a saint from God's blessings. Just
[38:19] because you're coming to church and
[38:22] you've been a a a Christian for, you
[38:26] know, 50 years or you've been a preacher
[38:29] for a hundred years. That that does sin
[38:32] will separate the preacher just like
[38:34] it'll separate the sinner. Sin will
[38:38] separate the believer from God. Can you
[38:41] say amen? So we was as we think about
[38:45] this these waters of separation. Amen. I
[38:49] I want us to to look in in in our uh in
[38:55] the scripture because the the Bible says
[38:57] that God's word is a light. Amen. God's
[39:01] word is a mirror. God's word is Amen.
[39:06] It's a uh it's the revealer of our
[39:09] thoughts. as we have gone these last few
[39:12] services, how that the word of God,
[39:15] how that the word of God divides,
[39:18] Amen. divides us under between spirit
[39:21] and soul. Now, I did not say it divided
[39:23] between body and spirit. Amen. Your body
[39:26] and your spirit are connected together.
[39:28] They're inter that you they're
[39:30] interchangeable. You can't uh um your
[39:34] attitudes come out in your body. Your
[39:36] cravings come out through your flesh.
[39:38] your they're they're both together. But
[39:41] the word has come to separate spirit
[39:46] from the soul. Amen. Because your spirit
[39:49] is where your your your your is your
[39:52] appetite. But God's word comes in and
[39:55] separates the eternal. Amen. From the
[39:58] natural if if you understand that. So
[40:01] God wants us to look his word is is a
[40:05] light. It's important because we there's
[40:09] there's there is um there
[40:13] the world's got it today that truth is
[40:16] I've got my truth and you've got your
[40:19] truth. But that's not that's not
[40:22] accurate at all. God's word is truth.
[40:25] God's word is our absolute truth. And so
[40:31] amen we that the script this as the
[40:33] scripture says there in proverbs 21:2
[40:36] every way of a man is right in his own
[40:40] eyes but the Lord ponders the hearts. So
[40:44] the man thinks that well I I am fine but
[40:48] you see God is the author of all
[40:51] righteousness. God is the author. He is
[40:55] the amen the originator of truth. And
[40:58] he's the one that is going to judge your
[41:01] heart. He He's the one that is
[41:04] separating Amen. soul and spirit. He's
[41:08] the one can Can you say amen? Amen.
[41:11] Proverbs 14:12. There is a way that
[41:14] seemth right to a man. Uh but the end
[41:18] thereof are the ways of death. So So
[41:21] there that that is telling us that there
[41:24] there can be justification.
[41:27] Amen. in our own hearts with God and and
[41:30] and it and it not come from God. Amen.
[41:33] That that we justify ourselves that we
[41:36] look and say, "Well, I'm not like this
[41:39] and I'm not like that. I'm coming to
[41:40] church. I I I've quit my drinking or I I
[41:44] I am I I'm now a musician or and and and
[41:48] we find ways to justify, Amen. our our
[41:52] ways with God." But let let me let me
[41:54] just let me just put it very clearly.
[41:57] There is only one source of
[42:00] righteousness. There's only one
[42:02] standard. It's not my standard. Not my
[42:05] standard. It's God's standard.
[42:09] It's not your parents' standard. Amen.
[42:11] It's not brother Brandham's standard. It
[42:14] is God's standard. It's his word. So we
[42:18] that the Bible says that God's word is
[42:22] like a light to us. Amen. God gives us
[42:25] his word to shine upon our hearts to let
[42:29] us know where we are with him. Well,
[42:32] aren't you glad for that? It's the mercy
[42:35] of God that shines his light to upon us.
[42:39] Remember, if you don't have God's light,
[42:42] you're in darkness. Amen. Everyone
[42:45] always says, "Amen. I love I love the
[42:47] lingo today. God knows my heart. He
[42:50] understands my heart. Yeah, he
[42:52] understands his heart. It's dark,
[42:53] smuddy. Amen. Just like the ju just like
[42:57] the uh the walls of hell. Hallelujah.
[43:00] God God knows you where your heart is.
[43:03] Amen. God knows where Well, I hope
[43:05] there's no hearts here. Let's darken
[43:06] somebody. But but the the the heart of a
[43:09] man, there's nothing of us that that can
[43:14] ever earn anything uh in our own
[43:16] ability. Everything has got to be
[43:18] according to the word of God. Now, now
[43:20] there in Jeremiah 17:9, it says, "The
[43:23] heart is deceitful above all things and
[43:27] desperately wicked. Who can know it? I
[43:30] the Lord search the heart. I am there
[43:35] looking." Amen. I search the heart. And
[43:38] the scripture says, and he says, I try
[43:40] the reigns even to give every man
[43:42] according to his ways and according to
[43:43] the fruit of his doing. Amen. Now, we
[43:46] understand as we have read many a times
[43:49] there in in Matthew 24:24 said there's
[43:52] going to be false Christs, false
[43:54] preachers, false anointed ones. Amen.
[43:57] And and they're going to show great
[43:59] signs and wonders. And he says it would
[44:01] be so close that it would deceive the
[44:03] very elected if it were possible. But
[44:07] what makes the difference? Why isn't it
[44:09] possible? Is because God has given his
[44:13] word to his elect. She cannot be
[44:17] deceived because God's word is shining
[44:20] upon her and she can see where she's
[44:22] walking. Well, aren't you glad for that?
[44:25] Amen. In this dark world. Hallelujah.
[44:28] Now, now the scripture says, it says
[44:30] there in in Psalms 90 and8, "Thou has
[44:34] set our iniquities before thee." In
[44:38] other words, God is shining a spotlight
[44:41] upon our every one of our hearts and he
[44:45] magnifies those iniquities when we come
[44:48] and he is showing us where we stand. Can
[44:51] you say amen? Amen. And he says, "Our
[44:53] our iniquities before thee, and our
[44:55] secret sins in the light of thy
[44:57] countenance." So when God's word is
[45:00] present, then God's word begins to
[45:02] reveal things about us that we need to
[45:05] see.
[45:07] And I want to tell you because it's the
[45:09] grace of God. He doesn't want you
[45:11] standing in judgment on the on the white
[45:13] throne judgment. He wants you standing,
[45:16] Amen. right here and cleaning your lives
[45:20] right now in his presence while you
[45:23] still got blood. There won't be any
[45:25] blood when you get on the other side. So
[45:27] God wants you to clean yourself up right
[45:29] here.
[45:31] Whoa, that just makes me feel good. Can
[45:34] you say amen? Now the word, God's word
[45:38] will be the final judge. Did you guys
[45:40] know that the Bible that we preach out
[45:42] of is the very word that that that you
[45:46] will that the sinners and the other
[45:48] church members, the church members that
[45:51] are saying, "Oh, it don't matter how we
[45:54] whether we cut our hair or not. It don't
[45:55] matter what we what we dress like. It
[45:58] don't matter how we live. It don't
[45:59] matter. It don't matter whether we're
[46:01] living in adultery or or or or however.
[46:04] It don't matter if we're telling lies.
[46:06] You know, God knows my heart." And the
[46:09] thing is, God sent his word to expose
[46:11] your heart. And if you won't allow God's
[46:14] word to expose your heart, then you're
[46:17] going to have to come up on the on the
[46:19] great white throne. And and and let's
[46:21] just read it. It's here in the book of
[46:22] Revelations, re Revelations the 20th
[46:25] chapter and the 11th verse. And it says,
[46:28] "And I saw a great white throne, and him
[46:33] that sat on it, from whose uh face the
[46:37] earth and the heaven fled away, and
[46:39] there was found no more place for them.
[46:42] I saw the dead, small and great, stand
[46:44] before God, and the books were open, and
[46:48] another book was open, which is the book
[46:50] of life. And the book and the dead were
[46:53] judged out of those things which were
[46:55] written in the books. What? What books?
[47:01] What books? You're going to be judged by
[47:04] the things written in the books.
[47:09] That's what your prophet said. You're
[47:11] going to be judged. So, so we don't ever
[47:14] want to take uh advantage of God and
[47:18] say, "Well, God, you've given me a
[47:20] prophet." and then not take the light
[47:22] that the God shone through that prophet
[47:25] in our lives and we justify sin. There
[47:28] should be no lukewarmness in the bride
[47:32] of Jesus Christ.
[47:34] Amen. Amen. Now, now watch this. It says
[47:37] uh the book of life, the dead were
[47:38] judged out of those things written in
[47:39] the books according to their works. The
[47:41] sea gave up the dead which were in it
[47:43] and death and hell delivered up the dead
[47:45] which were in them and they were judged
[47:47] every man according to their works. So,
[47:49] so we've got a book of names. Amen. That
[47:52] is going to have the book of life. It's
[47:54] going to have everything that you've
[47:55] done, everything you've said, everything
[47:57] every time uh uh uh brother Brandham
[47:59] even says there there will be a video
[48:02] playing, amen, of your life that you
[48:04] just cannot deny. Every time the
[48:06] preacher came up and told you, you need
[48:08] to really fix this and you said, "Well,
[48:10] I don't think I really do need to." That
[48:12] will be there on that day and there will
[48:15] be no recourse. Amen.
[48:18] There will be no recourse. You say,
[48:20] "Brother Wendle, we shouldn't be." Well,
[48:21] you I mean, we're beyond all of this
[48:23] kind of preaching, are we really? The
[48:25] word has come in this day so that we
[48:28] will know how to live.
[48:33] Amen. We should expect our preachers to
[48:35] preach, Amen. the truth. We should
[48:37] expect our preachers to preach hell hot
[48:40] and heaven sweet. Can you say amen? We
[48:42] should. Amen. because I don't want to go
[48:46] uh uh uh be there on that day and find
[48:49] out that my preacher, you know, hasn't
[48:52] quite been as honest with me as what he
[48:54] should have been.
[48:58] Hallelujah. So, so we want to look at
[49:00] that. So, the word is the only way that
[49:06] we can be deception proof. Amen. They're
[49:09] in Psalms 119 and 104. Through thy
[49:13] precepts I get understanding.
[49:16] Therefore, I hate every false way. I
[49:19] love that. Through thy precepts,
[49:22] I get understanding.
[49:25] And therefore, I hate every false way.
[49:30] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[49:34] light unto my path. Amen. I want to walk
[49:37] in the paths of righteousness. Can you
[49:39] say amen? In the beginning was the word.
[49:42] The word was with God. The word was God.
[49:45] Is that right? It was that word that
[49:47] called commanded light to shine out of
[49:49] darkness. John 1:9 says, "Amen. That he
[49:52] is the true light which lightth every
[49:55] man that cometh into the world." Amen.
[49:58] You you you'll never sleep slip anything
[50:00] over on God. You can't slip anything
[50:02] over on God because he is all knowing.
[50:05] He is the light. Amen. He dwells in the
[50:08] light. Are are you understanding? Where
[50:11] is Jesus tonight? Jesus is in the
[50:14] presence of that light.
[50:16] The same light that would come among us
[50:19] uh h through the pillar of fire. They
[50:21] would come to brother Brham. Amen. Jesus
[50:23] is living. That body is living in the
[50:27] presence of that almighty light.
[50:31] Can you say amen? That's exactly right.
[50:35] Now, amen. So, you'll never dumb down
[50:38] God. His nature will never change. So,
[50:43] what God ever says at one place, he'll
[50:45] say it. He'll mean it forever. Amen.
[50:48] What he says, he means. Somebody say,
[50:50] "What he says?" What he says, he means.
[50:54] Amen. There's a song that that that that
[50:56] we used to sing a lot. Oh, search me
[50:58] Lord. Oh, search me Lord. Shine your
[51:02] light down from heaven over my soul. If
[51:06] you find anything that should not be,
[51:09] take it out, oh Lord, and strengthen me.
[51:12] I want to live right. I want to be
[51:15] saved, and I want to be whole. Amen.
[51:19] Amen. So, thy sins have separated you
[51:24] from God. It's not that God can't hear.
[51:27] It's not that God's arm is short, right?
[51:32] Lord, help us to always walk. Can you
[51:35] say amen? And I will say any in any any
[51:38] of us that that stands in here tonight,
[51:40] Amen. We want that word to discern our
[51:43] heart. Hebrews 4:12. Amen. We should all
[51:46] know it by heart. For the word of God is
[51:49] quick or living. Amen. powerful and
[51:52] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[51:54] piercing unto the viding, a sunder of
[51:57] soul and spirit, and the joints and the
[51:59] marorrow, and is a discerner of the
[52:01] thoughts and intents of the heart. Let's
[52:03] go to the 13th verse. Amen. And neither
[52:06] is there any creature that is not
[52:08] manifest in his sight, but all things
[52:11] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[52:15] in whom we have to do. Can you say amen?
[52:18] So, so what is what are we saying? The
[52:20] Almighty God has seen us in this dark
[52:25] world of of of sin and death that Satan
[52:29] has blinded every other other man and
[52:32] woman. But God's got some elect down in
[52:37] this planet earth. And God says, "I'm
[52:40] going to penetrate some light so that
[52:43] they can see. I know who they are, but
[52:46] I'm going to let them see who they are.
[52:49] I can see their sin, but I'm going to
[52:51] let them see their sin, and I'm going to
[52:55] pro provide them plenty of detergent.
[52:56] Well, glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[53:00] You take you take that bleach a and you
[53:03] you take that ink and you and you drop
[53:05] it in bleach. Amen. Hallelujah. the
[53:09] through the blood of Jesus Christ, it
[53:11] doesn't just take away a little bit of
[53:13] the power, but it takes away all of the
[53:16] power and the stain of that ink. Are are
[53:19] you hearing me? And I just want to tell
[53:21] you, Amen. We we didn't know. We didn't
[53:24] know. We we we didn't know we were wrong
[53:27] until God's word come in and said,
[53:29] "You're wrong." We didn't know. Amen. We
[53:31] didn't know. But God shown his life. God
[53:34] convicted us by his spirit. And now
[53:36] there's blood. We can take every one of
[53:38] our sins, every one of our shortcomings,
[53:41] put them in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[53:43] Amen. And they can be forever more gone.
[53:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:49] Hallelujah. It's God's grace to his
[53:52] elect.
[53:55] Oh my. You you you Satan will never
[53:59] Satan will never stand before God on
[54:01] that day and say, "Well, they were just
[54:02] a protected bunch." Amen. And God
[54:05] brought us out of the honky tonks and
[54:07] and and and and and heathenism and and
[54:10] adulterous relationships. Brought us out
[54:12] of Amen. jail houses and prisons and
[54:17] well, come on now. He brought us all out
[54:20] of those things here to shine his light
[54:22] upon us.
[54:26] Amen. Hallelujah. What happens when the
[54:29] light shines? the light shines here.
[54:31] Here in 2 Corinthians 4 and2, Amen.
[54:35] Here's here's the believer. Now look at
[54:37] this. It says, "But have renounced the
[54:40] hidden things of dishonesty
[54:43] and not walking in craftiness, nor
[54:46] handling the word of God deceitfully."
[54:48] In other words, God sees my heart. Well,
[54:50] God don't mean that. Well, God
[54:51] understands. God understands one thing.
[54:53] That's his word, and that you need to
[54:54] line up to it.
[54:57] That's what God understands. And God has
[54:59] sent light to you for you to line up.
[55:06] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[55:09] He says, "But by the manifestation of
[55:11] the truth, commending ourselves to every
[55:14] man's conscience in the sight of God.
[55:18] But if our gospel be hid, it said to
[55:21] them that are lost, in whom the God of
[55:23] this world hath blinded the minds of
[55:26] them which believe not, lest the light
[55:30] of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
[55:33] the image of God, should shine to them.
[55:35] Now, think about that. There's going to
[55:37] be those whose minds are blinded, and
[55:40] Satan is going to so blind them in order
[55:43] to keep the light of God from coming.
[55:45] But I just want to say predestination
[55:48] will always win out.
[55:51] Predestination will always win out. I
[55:54] don't care how foul you were. God, there
[55:58] was nothing that Satan can do. There was
[56:00] nothing that sin could do. There was
[56:02] nothing that could keep the light of God
[56:05] from penetrating you because you had to
[56:09] come out.
[56:12] Well, sin never did have Amen. He never
[56:15] did have dominion. He sin never did have
[56:19] uh uh the right to you. Sin never did
[56:22] have the title deed to you. Only God has
[56:25] the title deed. Satan's tried to take
[56:28] you. Satan's tried to destroy you.
[56:30] Satan's tried to destroy your life, your
[56:33] marriage, your your mind. But he's never
[56:35] had the title D. I want to tell you, the
[56:38] one who's got the title deed has sent
[56:40] the light down to you and said, "You are
[56:42] mine.
[56:45] You are mine. I've shed my blood for
[56:47] you. Amen. Come on back. I'll worship.
[56:51] I'll cleanse you. I'll make you what I
[56:54] want you to be. Can you say amen?
[56:57] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. Now, watch.
[57:02] He says
[57:04] the go the fourth verse again. and whom
[57:06] the God of this world hath blinded the
[57:07] minds of them which believe not, lest
[57:09] the light of the glorious gospel of
[57:10] Christ
[57:12] uh uh uh who is the image of God should
[57:14] shine unto them. For we preach not
[57:16] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[57:19] ourselves your servants. For God,
[57:22] someone say hallelujah. Who commanded
[57:24] the light to shine out of darkness in
[57:26] the beginning, hath shined in our hearts
[57:30] to give the light of the knowledge
[57:35] of the of the glory of God in the face
[57:39] of Jesus Christ. Satan don't want.
[57:42] Matter of fact, Satan, Sister Keys,
[57:43] they're in uh uh let's just look at at
[57:46] the opposite there. Amen. Now, keep that
[57:48] because we want to go back to it in just
[57:49] a minute. But there in in uh in St. John
[57:52] uh 3 and um uh we'll just start there at
[57:56] the 16th verse. Amen. For God so loved
[57:59] the world that that he gave his his only
[58:02] begotten son
[58:04] uh that whosoever believeth in him
[58:06] should not perish but have everlasting
[58:08] life. And for God sent not his son into
[58:11] the world to condemn the world, but that
[58:13] the world through him might be saved. So
[58:16] God didn't send his son to send everyone
[58:18] to hell. He sent his son for the for the
[58:23] very uh vehicle to save. Now watch
[58:29] watch. Amen. That it says that the world
[58:31] through him might be saved. 18th verse.
[58:33] He that believeth on him is not
[58:35] condemned but he that believeth not is
[58:36] condemned already because he hath not
[58:38] believed in the name of the only
[58:39] begotten son of God. And this is the
[58:43] condemnation that light is coming to the
[58:47] world and men loved darkness rather than
[58:52] light because their deeds were evil.
[58:57] For every man that doeth evil hateth the
[59:01] light, neither comes to the light, lest
[59:04] his deeds should be reproved.
[59:07] But he that doeth truth, someone shout
[59:10] hallelujah.
[59:11] comes to the light. That means you and I
[59:15] did not we were not born with the light.
[59:18] We were born in darkness. We were shaped
[59:20] in iniquity. But when the light comes,
[59:23] the elect says, "I'm coming to the
[59:25] light. I'm coming to the light. I'm
[59:28] coming back home. I'm coming back where
[59:30] I belong. I've always belong." Well, can
[59:32] you say amen now? I'm not going to sit
[59:34] here in the muck and the mire. I'm not
[59:36] going to sit here and play with these
[59:37] drugs anymore. I read flat. Why do that?
[59:40] Amen. My sin is going to keep me
[59:42] separated from God. Why do that? My God,
[59:46] I'm going to come back home. I'm going
[59:48] to come back to the light. I'm going to
[59:50] see God for his power. And where the
[59:52] light is, there is freedom.
[59:57] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Why am I
[59:59] going to sit there in darkness in that
[1:00:01] cesspool? Amen. Of just constantly over
[1:00:04] and over and over and over got something
[1:00:06] against somebody. Amen. and and and and
[1:00:08] and and we'll go back and just and and
[1:00:10] just keep on gnawing on that person and
[1:00:12] keep gnawing on that person and you just
[1:00:15] do why why why your deeds are evil. Why
[1:00:18] don't you come to the light?
[1:00:24] Oh, glory to God. Well, yeah, you know,
[1:00:28] sneaking around cutting our hairs, you
[1:00:30] girls, I I I just I just want to see
[1:00:32] what I look like. Why? Your sin is
[1:00:35] separating you from God.
[1:00:38] Well, I'm just clicking here on on this
[1:00:40] deal here. It It's on the news and I'm
[1:00:42] just clicking here to see what it see
[1:00:44] what it says. And Amen. And and and and
[1:00:46] and yeah, the girl's not, you know, all
[1:00:48] the way undressed, but your sin has
[1:00:52] separated you from the power and glory
[1:00:56] of God. God has come to set us free.
[1:01:04] Amen. Now, we got to walk in the light.
[1:01:08] That song, I'll walk in the light.
[1:01:11] It's a beautiful light. It comes where
[1:01:15] the dew drops of mercies are bright.
[1:01:19] Shine all around me by day and by night.
[1:01:24] Jesus, the light of the world. I'm
[1:01:28] living in a dark world, but God's light
[1:01:30] is all around me.
[1:01:32] Oh, glory to God. Everyone's going to
[1:01:35] hell in a hand basket. Hallelujah. But
[1:01:37] there's light around us. Amen. The power
[1:01:40] of darkness is overtaking families
[1:01:42] everywhere. But there's light among the
[1:01:45] believers.
[1:01:47] Amen. Can you say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] So now, as as I as I just read, now here
[1:01:56] is here's two people.
[1:01:58] There's got some that would not come to
[1:02:01] the light because they loved the
[1:02:05] darkness.
[1:02:06] But the Apostle Paul says,
[1:02:10] "I've renounced all the hidden things of
[1:02:12] dishonesty.
[1:02:14] I've I I I I'm not walking in craftiness
[1:02:17] and handling the word of God deceitfully
[1:02:19] to to to to justify my state. I'm not
[1:02:23] doing that." Amen. for the light of the
[1:02:26] glorious gospel of Jesus Christ has come
[1:02:28] to shine on me and I have found out who
[1:02:31] I am.
[1:02:34] Well, glory, did you know that you
[1:02:36] weren't created to sin in the first
[1:02:37] place? There was none of you created to
[1:02:39] sin. Is that right?
[1:02:42] Hallelujah. The serpent's children never
[1:02:45] will come to the light. But I guarantee
[1:02:47] you, every one of God's sons and
[1:02:49] daughters will come to the light.
[1:02:53] Well, hallelujah. 1 John 1 and5
[1:02:55] something that we this a scripture we
[1:02:57] should all know very well and this then
[1:02:59] is the message which we have heard of
[1:03:01] him and declare unto you that God is
[1:03:04] light in him is no darkness at all if we
[1:03:07] say we have fellowship with him and walk
[1:03:09] in darkness we lie and do not the truth
[1:03:12] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:03:15] the light the word we have fellowship
[1:03:17] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:03:23] if If we say we have no sin, we deceive
[1:03:26] ourselves and the truth is not in us. If
[1:03:28] we confess our sins, he is faithful and
[1:03:31] just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:03:34] cleanse us from all unrighteousness. And
[1:03:36] if we say that we have not sinned, we
[1:03:38] make him a liar and his word is not in
[1:03:40] us. Can you say amen? Amen. So let the
[1:03:44] word let the word be my absolute. The
[1:03:47] word must be my absolute.
[1:03:51] If you're looking in the word Amen. and
[1:03:53] you're seeing some junk on you. It's
[1:03:56] God's word that's supposed to be the
[1:03:57] light. It's God's word that is the
[1:03:59] mirror. It's not God's word's problem.
[1:04:01] It's your problem.
[1:04:03] Amen. But it becomes God's problem when
[1:04:06] you apply the blood.
[1:04:08] Well, glory to God. Can you say amen?
[1:04:11] That's right. Amen. So, so as we have as
[1:04:16] we have talked about Amen. If you'd go
[1:04:18] to that slide, that first slide, Sister
[1:04:20] Keys, we have talked a little bit the
[1:04:22] these last several services on the Amen.
[1:04:25] on that tabernacle and and and so you've
[1:04:28] got your outer courts. Amen. And and
[1:04:31] your outer courts is on the inside of
[1:04:33] that or is on the inside of that uh that
[1:04:37] wall. Amen. And you see you see two
[1:04:40] things there. The first one that you
[1:04:41] that you come across is going to be
[1:04:44] Amen. that that's that's the place where
[1:04:46] they offered the uh uh uh the
[1:04:49] sacrifices. Amen. And then the other
[1:04:52] place if you were going in before you
[1:04:53] could go into the uh holy place, you
[1:04:56] were to come to that water labor. Amen.
[1:05:00] Now, you had the the breast the brass
[1:05:02] altar. There's where the fire was.
[1:05:04] There's where the sacrifice was burnt.
[1:05:07] There's there's where the the lamb amen
[1:05:10] was was slain for you. But your your
[1:05:12] your your goal your goal was to get
[1:05:16] back. And if Sister Keys, if you'd go
[1:05:18] all the way to the third go to the third
[1:05:20] slide there. Amen. And and and and the
[1:05:24] the the goal of the priest was to come
[1:05:27] and I don't know this. Did I try this
[1:05:29] before and it didn't work? Hallelujah.
[1:05:31] Praise the Lord. So the goal it's just
[1:05:34] not going to work right there. The goal
[1:05:35] is to get to that yellow part. Amen. Now
[1:05:38] you're coming in over here on this side.
[1:05:40] But the goal, the priest, your sins were
[1:05:42] not covered until you got over here to
[1:05:45] that uh right inside that holies of
[1:05:48] holies that that third that third place.
[1:05:51] Amen. Now you're justified with the
[1:05:55] blood. Amen. The blood was shed for you.
[1:05:58] The blood the the blood God is now able
[1:06:01] to look at you. But that water labor,
[1:06:04] and this is what I want to deal with for
[1:06:05] a few moments tonight, is the water
[1:06:08] labor was was had a mirror. They they
[1:06:11] were to take the women's looking glass.
[1:06:14] Amen. Now, back then, they didn't have
[1:06:16] glass. Mirrors weren't quite made back
[1:06:19] then, but they Amen. But it was it was
[1:06:21] made, they say, of of of real uh uh
[1:06:24] polished brass. And the scripture says
[1:06:27] that they were to take the the ladies uh
[1:06:30] matter of fact I had never seen it until
[1:06:32] today. Amen. Where the scripture says
[1:06:35] that uh uh that they were to take the
[1:06:37] lady's mirrors and to bring it in and
[1:06:40] they were to make uh that water labor
[1:06:43] and when and when they the priests would
[1:06:45] would they they would take the they as
[1:06:49] they were washing their hands. Amen. and
[1:06:52] and they it was like a mirror where they
[1:06:55] could see their reflection. Amen. They
[1:06:58] they could see the blood. They could see
[1:07:00] and they were to wash themselves before
[1:07:04] they could go in to that holy place.
[1:07:07] They had to wash themselves with that
[1:07:11] water. Amen. Uh uh brother Brandham
[1:07:13] called it the water of separation. It
[1:07:16] was going to separate from the outer
[1:07:18] court and now walking on into that holy
[1:07:21] place. Amen. This this was going to be a
[1:07:26] a a
[1:07:28] entering into the supernatural realm of
[1:07:31] God. It meant something. They could not
[1:07:35] go any further
[1:07:38] without you were not allowed inside that
[1:07:43] holy place until you come into that
[1:07:47] water labor. Amen. Those were the waters
[1:07:50] of separation. The pre It was a type
[1:07:54] that they were to look there there in in
[1:07:57] in uh there in the book of of he uh of
[1:08:01] of Ephesians. Here's here's what it
[1:08:03] let's let's look here in the book of
[1:08:04] Ephesians. It was a type of the word e
[1:08:08] Ephesians the 5th chapter.
[1:08:11] Amen. Ephesians 5.
[1:08:15] And it says um
[1:08:19] uh
[1:08:23] uh let's start at the first verse.
[1:08:24] Submitting yourselves 21st verse.
[1:08:27] Submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:08:28] the fear of God. Wives submit yourselves
[1:08:29] to your own husbands as unto the Lord.
[1:08:31] For the husband is the head of the wife,
[1:08:33] even as Christ is the head of the
[1:08:35] church, he is the savior of the body.
[1:08:37] Therefore, as the church is subject unto
[1:08:40] Christ,
[1:08:42] so let the wives be to their own
[1:08:43] husbands in everything. Amen. You got to
[1:08:46] you're subject to everything. You're not
[1:08:48] subject to you're not subject to the uh
[1:08:50] the man across the aisle from you. You
[1:08:53] are subject to your own husband as long
[1:08:56] as as long as he's doing things like the
[1:08:59] other guy. No, you are subject to your
[1:09:02] wife. He is your head. Or you are
[1:09:05] subject to your husband. He is your
[1:09:08] head. Amen. Now, you hear me? Now,
[1:09:10] there's there there's been a lot of
[1:09:12] people that that that you know uh uh
[1:09:15] they compare they compare their poor guy
[1:09:17] with everybody. Well, I don't have a
[1:09:19] ring like her and I she's got a nice car
[1:09:22] and I listen.
[1:09:28] Love doesn't Love is not things. Love
[1:09:31] has never been things. Love is a
[1:09:33] spiritual thing. You cannot go to the
[1:09:36] bank, Amen, or go to the store. You
[1:09:39] can't go to Dollar General and order a
[1:09:41] dollar worth of love. You cannot go to
[1:09:43] Sonic and ask for Amen. for the number
[1:09:47] two love basket. You cannot go anywhere
[1:09:50] and buy love. Love is a spiritual thing.
[1:09:54] God created man and woman, spirit beings
[1:09:58] first.
[1:10:01] So when you have your guy, you love him
[1:10:06] and the materialistic things really just
[1:10:09] doesn't matter. I mean, yeah, you do. It
[1:10:11] is nice having a car with air
[1:10:12] conditioner. Yes, it is nice, you know,
[1:10:15] having more than a than a 300 foot
[1:10:17] house. But the thing is you're marrying
[1:10:20] him because there is something about
[1:10:23] that man that is that that has attracted
[1:10:26] you there and that there is something
[1:10:28] about that girl that you have fallen in
[1:10:29] love with. You're inseparable.
[1:10:33] Amen. Even if you have to have an
[1:10:34] outhouse, right? Amen. And so so we
[1:10:38] we've got the
[1:10:41] so so we we we but love is not love is
[1:10:47] not bodies. Love is spirit.
[1:10:55] It's funny how wives choose not to honor
[1:10:58] their husbands based on
[1:11:02] natural things. with you do this and you
[1:11:05] do that and you do that. Love has
[1:11:07] nothing to do with that.
[1:11:11] Okay, I'll keep going on.
[1:11:13] But honor, loving your husband,
[1:11:16] respecting submitting yourselves to your
[1:11:18] own husband in all things is what the
[1:11:21] scripture says. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:11:24] Now it says uh uh 25th verse, husbands,
[1:11:28] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:11:30] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:11:32] it. Now, now watch this. Christ, again,
[1:11:36] this was a spiritual thing.
[1:11:42] Your sins have separated you from your
[1:11:46] God. God says, I my girl is not going to
[1:11:52] be able to take care of herself and wash
[1:11:55] herself and in order to bring this
[1:11:57] restitution.
[1:11:59] Listen to me, men. You are the one. You
[1:12:04] are the one who is to bring restitution.
[1:12:06] You are the one that God has called to
[1:12:10] be the savior of the body.
[1:12:14] Hallelujah.
[1:12:15] So Christ so loved spiritual. It's the
[1:12:21] union invisible union. Christ so loved
[1:12:26] that he gave
[1:12:33] of himself
[1:12:35] in the flesh
[1:12:38] to bring reconciliation.
[1:12:41] Can you say amen?
[1:12:43] That he might sanctify
[1:12:46] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:12:49] water by the word. Amen. That he might
[1:12:54] sanctify. He gave his blood so that he
[1:12:57] can sanctifi. So what what what what is
[1:13:00] what what are you talking about? So
[1:13:01] you've got the Bible and then you've got
[1:13:03] a blood. Well, Brother Windle, they're
[1:13:04] two separate things. They're not two
[1:13:06] separate things. It was the lamb who
[1:13:08] gave the life, brother, sister keys, if
[1:13:10] you put that third slide back up. It was
[1:13:12] the lamb, amen, that was uh that that
[1:13:15] was slain there on the altar. And it is
[1:13:19] Christ is also type of the water labor
[1:13:23] that is showing you your blemishes.
[1:13:26] Are are you hearing me? The word was
[1:13:30] there and you can't separate Christ from
[1:13:33] his word. It was the bloody bleeding
[1:13:37] word that died for you.
[1:13:42] Can you say amen? Now, now watch this.
[1:13:46] It says that he might pres uh sanctify
[1:13:48] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:13:49] water by the word that he might present
[1:13:50] it to himself a glorious church not
[1:13:52] having a spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:13:54] thing that it might be holy and without
[1:13:56] blemish. So ought men to love their
[1:13:58] wives as their own bodies. And he that
[1:14:00] loveth his wife loves himself. For no
[1:14:03] man hath yet hated his own flesh, but
[1:14:05] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the
[1:14:08] Lord the church. For we are members of
[1:14:11] his body, of his flesh, and of his
[1:14:14] bones.
[1:14:15] Now,
[1:14:17] so going back to the water labor again,
[1:14:21] this is a water of separation.
[1:14:24] The word is the divider.
[1:14:28] The word shows you even in your spirit
[1:14:31] sins.
[1:14:34] The word will show you hypocrisy.
[1:14:39] The word will show you. And if you let
[1:14:41] it, the word will show you that a lot of
[1:14:44] these sins in the fourth dimension can
[1:14:47] be taken care of if we'll put that word
[1:14:49] back up and discern what we should be
[1:14:53] looking at, listening to, and what we
[1:14:55] should and should not.
[1:15:01] If we're going to be a powerful church
[1:15:04] like the prophet said we're going to be,
[1:15:06] then we're going to have to take that
[1:15:08] word and place it right there at our
[1:15:11] heart and say, "Lord, I I I I'm wanting
[1:15:15] you to stand guard right there." Can you
[1:15:17] say, "Amen." Amen. Now, remember now,
[1:15:20] now, Sister Keys, the third slide again.
[1:15:23] Amen. Hallelujah. Someone say thank you
[1:15:25] sister keys. Keys. So, so the the the
[1:15:30] water labor you could not go into that
[1:15:34] place without the word. You cannot go
[1:15:39] beyond the word in into the lampstand.
[1:15:42] Amen. You cannot you you cannot partake
[1:15:45] of the shoe bread. You cannot burn
[1:15:47] incense before that most holy place. If
[1:15:51] you were to go in there without washing
[1:15:52] in that water labor, Amen. and they were
[1:15:55] to wash their hands, they were to wash
[1:15:56] their feet, Amen. that they they had to
[1:16:00] be consecrated and dedicated or they
[1:16:02] would die. You could not enter without
[1:16:06] going through that protocol. Can you say
[1:16:08] amen? Now, many times there's where our
[1:16:11] problem is today in the church church
[1:16:15] world. Amen. We're claiming a lot of
[1:16:18] that's why we're powerless. There ain't
[1:16:20] nobody back there in that most holy
[1:16:22] place.
[1:16:25] Brother Brandham was with with God in
[1:16:27] that most holy place,
[1:16:29] but it was a consecrated life, too.
[1:16:32] Are you hearing me? So So that brazen
[1:16:36] labor was is is incredible. You can't
[1:16:40] come near Amen. to burn incense. You
[1:16:43] cannot do any of this without first
[1:16:46] coming in. Amen. Well, bless the Lord.
[1:16:50] And that word must be our absolute. And
[1:16:54] that's the reason why there in 1 Peter
[1:16:56] 4:17, it says, "For the time has come
[1:16:59] that judgment must begin at the house of
[1:17:01] God." It's got it's got to begin at the
[1:17:04] house of God. In other words, God's word
[1:17:06] points out the things in our lives.
[1:17:09] Amen. And then God's blood is right
[1:17:11] there to wash us and to cleanse us and
[1:17:13] to make us totally whole. Can you say
[1:17:16] amen? Amen. That That's exactly right.
[1:17:19] So So we're we're How many's glad for
[1:17:21] that? Now that brass always represents
[1:17:23] judgment. Brass is judgment. The water
[1:17:26] is the washing of the water of the word.
[1:17:30] The Old Testament, it was a type. Neman,
[1:17:33] that water labor, brass water labor, was
[1:17:36] a type of the washing of the word that
[1:17:39] would take place. The word, they had it
[1:17:42] in the Old Testament, but it could never
[1:17:43] wash them and make them clean. Amen. It
[1:17:46] could never do it. Can you say amen?
[1:17:48] Now that there in in first 1 Timothy 5
[1:17:51] and 24 it says some men's sins are open
[1:17:55] beforehand going before the judgment and
[1:17:58] some men they follow after. Brother
[1:18:02] Brandham would say before you can enter
[1:18:04] into this holy place there is a blood
[1:18:06] veil hanging there for the cleansing.
[1:18:09] You must recognize that the blood is an
[1:18:11] innocent substitute through the
[1:18:14] preaching of the word brought down the
[1:18:16] blood veil. In there you see someone
[1:18:19] died in your place. Then you'll throw
[1:18:22] down all of your earthly possessions,
[1:18:24] all your fain dangle ideas, all your
[1:18:26] dancing, your immoral living, all the
[1:18:28] things that you thought up in your own
[1:18:30] self that you and uh
[1:18:34] that you go to church and your new rules
[1:18:36] and your ten commandments and your
[1:18:38] non-meat eatating and all these things.
[1:18:39] You lay it aside and plunge wholly into
[1:18:42] the blood and say, "Lord, wash me and
[1:18:44] cleanse me." Then the Holy Spirit inside
[1:18:47] this blood cell is where the fellowship
[1:18:49] is and it draws you through the blood of
[1:18:51] the cleansing into the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:54] into the Jesus uh the Lord Jesus by the
[1:18:58] Holy Spirit. Then you're in fellowship.
[1:19:00] Old things have passed away. Then you're
[1:19:02] in fellowship by the Holy Spirit drawing
[1:19:05] you into relationship with God. Then
[1:19:07] there is only uh here it is only one
[1:19:11] meeting place that any man can meet and
[1:19:13] worship today in true fellowship. That's
[1:19:16] in Christ Jesus. Can you say amen? Now
[1:19:20] we I'm not going to hold you uh too much
[1:19:22] longer. Now I am going to show you here
[1:19:25] as we have as as we have uh discussed
[1:19:28] this in the past and I and uh this the
[1:19:31] last service. So now remember, you are
[1:19:36] the prophet brought this in that you are
[1:19:38] a a a tabernacle with three rooms just
[1:19:43] like this one here is. Amen. Your a
[1:19:45] tabernacle. Your your body, spirit, and
[1:19:48] soul. Amen. So your spirit I've got
[1:19:52] right here where the green is. Amen.
[1:19:53] Your spirit that's right up there with
[1:19:55] your mind. Amen. your spirits where your
[1:19:58] reasoning, your imagination.
[1:20:00] That's that's where uh uh those kinds of
[1:20:04] things come. Then there is the soul
[1:20:07] which is that little red spot right
[1:20:10] there in the heart. Amen. That is that
[1:20:13] that's that compartment. The blue is the
[1:20:16] outer court. So you've got the outer,
[1:20:19] then you've got the inner, then you've
[1:20:20] got the most holy place, body, spirit,
[1:20:23] and soul. You everyone got that? Amen.
[1:20:27] Now, Brother Brandham says now it is it
[1:20:30] is it is there God's designed it that
[1:20:35] it's got to come
[1:20:38] the word. Amen. Or let's just Yeah,
[1:20:41] let's just let's just let's just use the
[1:20:43] word here. Amen. And uh
[1:20:47] All right. There's the Bible. There's
[1:20:49] the word. The word comes through the
[1:20:52] channel of the mind. goes through the
[1:20:56] ears. These ears right here on each
[1:20:59] side. Amen. Comes through your spirit,
[1:21:03] your mind.
[1:21:05] And then it starts dropping down into
[1:21:07] this heart.
[1:21:10] That's the way God designed
[1:21:14] man.
[1:21:17] Man was supposed to walk with God. God.
[1:21:20] This is not This is This is the way men
[1:21:23] man was before sin ever came.
[1:21:30] He was a soul.
[1:21:33] Then God created that spirit, put him
[1:21:36] inside that body, and then God was to
[1:21:39] govern his thoughts. God was to govern
[1:21:42] his actions.
[1:21:45] Amen.
[1:21:47] That's the way God built us.
[1:21:51] But we've now got competition
[1:21:56] because now we've got this fourth
[1:21:59] dimension in this age that has just been
[1:22:01] invented. This fourth dimension that is
[1:22:05] doing what? this fourth dimension, your
[1:22:09] internet, your your your uh uh your
[1:22:13] radio, uh uh television, your cell
[1:22:16] phones, and it's all there to compete
[1:22:20] with that spirit.
[1:22:23] It's all coming into this.
[1:22:27] Now, if we allow
[1:22:30] sin here, it separates us from God.
[1:22:38] Praise the Lord. Are are are are you
[1:22:41] understanding? Brother Brandham would
[1:22:43] put it this way here. And I'm fixing to
[1:22:44] I'm fixing to close, but I want you to
[1:22:46] catch this. All right. So So I'm going
[1:22:48] to put a little I'm going to put this
[1:22:50] like this right here. All right. Now,
[1:22:53] he's this this here is the three
[1:22:55] elements of of of of light, matter, and
[1:22:58] huh? Volume right here. This this is
[1:23:01] this is you. This your this this this is
[1:23:04] where we're all looking at each other.
[1:23:05] I'm wearing this and you're wearing that
[1:23:07] and here we are. Okay, this is us. And
[1:23:10] some of y'all look uglier than him.
[1:23:12] Amen. But anyways, no. Okay. Now,
[1:23:16] Brother Brandham says there there's the
[1:23:18] invisible realm. There are three
[1:23:20] dimensions going upward. Yeah. There's
[1:23:22] three dimensions going downward. He says
[1:23:25] up above us, you've got the souls made
[1:23:27] perfect, the theophanes, your grandpa
[1:23:29] and grandma that loved God. You've got
[1:23:32] that. That's a that's a dimension where
[1:23:34] they're still alive. Then you've got the
[1:23:36] angels. You've got God himself. Down
[1:23:39] below, you have got those those unjust
[1:23:41] souls are still alive. Sinners,
[1:23:46] Adolf Hitler is still alive. All right.
[1:23:50] He's still alive. Amen. He can't go to
[1:23:54] hell until he stands the white throne
[1:23:56] judgment. Yes. Hitler is going to be at
[1:23:59] the white throne judgment.
[1:24:02] Sad to say, there's going to be a bunch
[1:24:04] of makeelievers at the white throne
[1:24:06] judgment, too.
[1:24:09] God didn't create that for you. God
[1:24:11] created God gave us his light here to
[1:24:14] keep us from there. But if you don't
[1:24:16] take your sins seriously now, you're
[1:24:18] going to have to do it someday. So,
[1:24:20] you've got you've got the three
[1:24:21] dimensions going downward. You've got
[1:24:22] the unjust souls, then you've got the
[1:24:24] demons, and then you've got the third,
[1:24:26] which is which is Satan himself. Now,
[1:24:29] brother Brandham says each of these
[1:24:32] spirits are all coming into this into
[1:24:37] this dimension here into this earth. He
[1:24:40] says angelic uh angelic wars
[1:24:45] are now becoming human wars.
[1:24:49] Where did where did brother Brandham
[1:24:51] says the greatest battle ever fought?
[1:24:52] Where did he say it's going to be at? He
[1:24:54] said the meeting ground is right here
[1:24:58] and right here. Yeah. God is coming in
[1:25:01] with his word and this one's coming in
[1:25:03] right here. You wonder why you're why
[1:25:05] why you go through such hardship
[1:25:07] sometime in your mind and you wonder
[1:25:09] about that? There's the battleground
[1:25:11] right there in that head in your spirit.
[1:25:16] There is where the battleground is. The
[1:25:19] war is raging right now.
[1:25:23] Yes, sir. Are you hearing me? So, so how
[1:25:29] how how how do we win? The scripture
[1:25:31] says, "Humble ourselves, resist the
[1:25:35] devil, and he will flee."
[1:25:39] Satan, you were not created for Satan.
[1:25:44] You were not created. And just as when
[1:25:47] you keep this going, it separates you
[1:25:50] from your God.
[1:25:52] What would happen if you separate this?
[1:25:56] Then it would bring the communication
[1:25:59] back between you and God. Amen. If you
[1:26:02] could get rid of this thing that is
[1:26:04] corrupting your mind, corrupting your
[1:26:07] your being and cut that unbelief off and
[1:26:11] get it back lined up with God's
[1:26:13] dimension. That's what you were created
[1:26:16] for.
[1:26:18] Amen. Yes, sir. And the Bible's done
[1:26:21] told us,
[1:26:23] submit to God, resist the devil, and the
[1:26:26] devil's got to lead you. Because you
[1:26:29] weren't created for the devil. You see
[1:26:31] what I'm saying? So, as we as as we look
[1:26:35] in this final thing here, Amen. We want
[1:26:39] the Holy Spirit to have that control.
[1:26:42] You're going to live in this body as we
[1:26:44] lived as as we said on Sunday. You're
[1:26:45] going to live here. You still have a
[1:26:47] body. When you got saved, it didn't
[1:26:49] change. You're still yourself. You still
[1:26:52] got your mind. You still like ice cream.
[1:26:55] If you liked if you liked ice cream
[1:26:57] before, if if if you if you like fishing
[1:27:00] before, you still like fishing now. If
[1:27:02] you like that's the nature of this
[1:27:04] flesh. That's that God has no problem
[1:27:06] with your flesh.
[1:27:09] God has no problem with your mind,
[1:27:11] right?
[1:27:12] As long as you let that soul do all the
[1:27:14] controlling. Yes, God. Can you say amen?
[1:27:18] So, you're still coming. You're still
[1:27:20] living. You're you're you're you're so
[1:27:24] in this tabernacle that you're living
[1:27:26] in, you've not done away with your body.
[1:27:28] You've not done away with your mind. You
[1:27:30] have placed the channel of the word. You
[1:27:34] understand that that body is important.
[1:27:37] You are not going to be able God can't
[1:27:40] do nothing without your body. Right?
[1:27:43] Brother Brandham says he didn't choose
[1:27:44] the son. He didn't choose any other
[1:27:46] nature. He chose man to work his plan.
[1:27:49] He's got to use your body.
[1:27:53] But you've got to surrender your spirit
[1:27:55] man to the Holy Ghost. You've got to
[1:27:58] surrender that mind and say, "All
[1:28:00] right." Amen. The nature of the heart is
[1:28:02] saying, "Okay, I'm craving the na that
[1:28:04] born again. I'm craving I'm craving more
[1:28:06] of God." Amen. What does that start
[1:28:09] doing? Well, that's going to tell you,
[1:28:10] you know what? I'm not I'm not getting
[1:28:11] fed with with this television. Yes, your
[1:28:14] phone's a television. Amen. Yes. I I'm
[1:28:16] not I'm not getting fed with with with
[1:28:19] this sports all the time. I'm not
[1:28:20] getting fed with with with thinking on
[1:28:22] this all the time. So, what I'm going to
[1:28:24] do, I've got in this heart. Brother
[1:28:26] Brandham said right here in this heart
[1:28:28] right there. He said, "There's only one
[1:28:30] channel." Amen. You've got one channel.
[1:28:33] You've got one door in that channel, and
[1:28:35] it's your self-will. self-will will open
[1:28:38] it up to whatever it wants to open it up
[1:28:40] to. So if your heart is craving for the
[1:28:44] for the things of God, then it's going
[1:28:46] to say, "No, I don't want anything else
[1:28:49] but the presence of God. So I'm going to
[1:28:51] start praying. I'm going to start
[1:28:52] believe." But it's coming from the
[1:28:54] heart. It's not it's not something
[1:28:55] you're doing from your mind. It's
[1:28:56] something craving in your heart.
[1:29:03] Is that all right
[1:29:05] now?
[1:29:08] You see that water labor,
[1:29:11] that water labor,
[1:29:14] that water labor is right here at your
[1:29:18] spirit man. It's right here. That water
[1:29:21] labor is right there as you're walking
[1:29:23] in to this middle place.
[1:29:28] That's your spirit.
[1:29:29] That water labor is there to you got to
[1:29:34] brother Brandon would say it's the
[1:29:35] thinking man's filter. You got to use
[1:29:38] that filter. That word brother Brandham
[1:29:40] says that water labor is the word and
[1:29:43] the believer is to run everything that
[1:29:47] they think everything they believe
[1:29:51] through the word filter.
[1:29:54] Now if we done that
[1:29:57] hallelujah victory. Victory. Victory.
[1:30:00] It'd be victory. My God's God's already
[1:30:03] saying, "Listen, guys. My arm is not
[1:30:05] short that it cannot deliver. My ear is
[1:30:08] not deaf. You take care of your
[1:30:11] situations. I'll be right there with
[1:30:13] you. You've separated me from you."
[1:30:17] Well, hallelujah. Well, I don't want to
[1:30:20] be separated. I want to walk in one. And
[1:30:22] God has called us to be in union.
[1:30:25] Can you say amen?
[1:30:27] Amen. God's called us to walk in in in
[1:30:31] in in unity of of his spirit now. Amen.
[1:30:36] I I I I think that's just beautiful.
[1:30:39] Hallelujah. Amen. Sister Keys, if you'd
[1:30:42] go to that that fourth one now, and then
[1:30:44] we're at the musicians if they wanted to
[1:30:46] come on. That that'll that'll be just
[1:30:48] fine. Amen. your outer courts, this
[1:30:51] body, taste, smell, sight, hearing,
[1:30:56] feeling. Your spirit man is where your
[1:30:59] affections, your imaginations, your your
[1:31:02] your memory, conscience, and reasonings.
[1:31:05] And there's where Satan has hit us in
[1:31:07] that spirit realm. And there's where
[1:31:08] brother Brandham said that the greatest
[1:31:09] battle is fought right there in that
[1:31:11] mind. It's right there in that mind. And
[1:31:14] this fourth dimension today has got has
[1:31:18] got people totally bound because of
[1:31:19] that.
[1:31:22] But if that Holy Spirit, if you could
[1:31:24] ever open those channels up and let the
[1:31:26] Holy Ghost get past your your body, get
[1:31:28] past all of that and get into that most
[1:31:31] holy place, there's no telling what
[1:31:33] God's going to do for you. Come on.
[1:31:36] Hallelujah. God, you let the Holy Spirit
[1:31:38] come over you, Haven. There is just no
[1:31:40] telling what God's going to You can turn
[1:31:42] the world upside down. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:31:45] That's right. That's right. Amen.
[1:31:48] Because it's the Holy Spirit taking
[1:31:49] control. Brother Brandham says once that
[1:31:51] Holy Spirit ever get jumps on the inside
[1:31:53] of that most holy place, that was that
[1:31:55] that is where the glory of the Lord
[1:31:58] would be. I I I read that and I I I
[1:32:00] didn't uh I I I was I was wondering
[1:32:04] in the uh um I I I had a a place here
[1:32:09] that I that I read today and I thought
[1:32:12] it was just so beautiful and I don't
[1:32:14] know if I brought it
[1:32:16] if I brought it here. Uh apparently I
[1:32:19] didn't. Yeah.
[1:32:22] Yeah. And and this is Exodus 40 and 34
[1:32:26] and and to 38. And now this this here is
[1:32:29] that tabernacle. And so but now I
[1:32:33] there's something about that cloud. If
[1:32:35] you can ever get if you can ever get to
[1:32:38] that pleasing God, get get you you the
[1:32:41] blood has come. It's not your own
[1:32:43] ability. You can't do it. But the lamb
[1:32:45] has taken care of it. The word is there
[1:32:47] to wash your mind. Wash your mind. It's
[1:32:50] there. Somebody say, "Wash my mind. Wash
[1:32:53] me." There's spirit sins. You might not
[1:32:56] be sinning in your body, but there's a
[1:32:58] lot of spirit sins that that that that
[1:33:01] gets things going. But listen, if we can
[1:33:03] let that walk through, let the believer
[1:33:05] come on through. Come on through until
[1:33:08] he gets into that most holy place, then
[1:33:10] the glory of the Lord is there. Amen.
[1:33:14] Now watch. Brother Brandham says or not
[1:33:16] brother Brandham here here here in
[1:33:18] Exodus 40:34 it says then a cloud
[1:33:20] covered the tent of the congregation and
[1:33:22] the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:33:23] tabernacle. Moses was not able to enter
[1:33:26] into the tent of the congregation
[1:33:27] because the cloud abode thereon and the
[1:33:29] glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle
[1:33:31] and and when the cloud was taken up from
[1:33:33] over the tabernacle, the children of
[1:33:35] Israel went onward in all their
[1:33:37] journeys. But if the cloud were not
[1:33:39] taken up, then they journeyed till the
[1:33:42] day that it was taken up. The cloud of
[1:33:45] the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day
[1:33:50] and fire by night in the sight of all
[1:33:54] the house of Israel throughout all their
[1:33:57] journeys. Brother, I am not talking
[1:34:00] about a tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:34:02] anymore. You are looking at the
[1:34:04] tabernacle of the Lord. It's no wonder
[1:34:07] brother Brandham says that pillar of
[1:34:09] fire is with every adopted son. Yes,
[1:34:12] sir. Are you hearing me? Oh, bless the
[1:34:16] Lord. He says that that cloud was seen
[1:34:20] by the people always
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:27] because the requirements had been met.
[1:34:30] Well,
[1:34:32] tonight you could say that this was a
[1:34:34] sanctification message.
[1:34:36] This is something that
[1:34:40] sanctification, justification is God's
[1:34:42] looking upon his blood and he's that's
[1:34:45] the only way God could ever look at you
[1:34:49] through the blood. And God has come with
[1:34:52] his blood.
[1:34:54] And even though you're still the biggest
[1:34:56] numb skull around,
[1:34:59] I'll pick on someone that's asleep.
[1:35:02] Amen.
[1:35:04] Still,
[1:35:07] it takes its justification. God's God's
[1:35:09] got his blood shed for you. But God's
[1:35:12] not going to let you continue in your
[1:35:13] sin.
[1:35:15] God's got a design.
[1:35:17] God gave himself. He gave himself to
[1:35:22] sanctify his bride
[1:35:25] with the washing the water by the word.
[1:35:29] Justification is God saying, "I love
[1:35:32] you. Though your sins are scarlet,
[1:35:36] come unto me."
[1:35:38] Sanctification is, "I'm going to shine
[1:35:39] light now. I'm going to shine light upon
[1:35:42] you, and I want you to walk in that
[1:35:44] light. I've given you my blood. I want
[1:35:48] you to start doing some scrubbing."
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:52] God ain't doing the scrubbing. He's
[1:35:53] providing the light and he's providing
[1:35:55] the detergent.
[1:35:59] And there ain't no maids that's going to
[1:36:00] do the cleaning for you. You're going to
[1:36:02] have to do it yourself.
[1:36:04] You're going to have to do it yourself.
[1:36:05] Can you say amen? Amen. Clean me, Lord.
[1:36:10] Is it a once or is is it just a once
[1:36:13] just? No. No.
[1:36:17] Satan is going to be in that mind
[1:36:18] constantly. He's going to be fighting
[1:36:19] you constantly. He's going to be you.
[1:36:21] You got to con you've got to constantly
[1:36:24] cleanse your cleanse your souls. Cleanse
[1:36:27] your spirit,
[1:36:28] man.
[1:36:33] Well, glory to God.
[1:36:35] What do we sing?
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:41] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:36:46] You have my life.
[1:36:50] You brought me out of darkness
[1:36:55] into glorious
[1:36:58] light
[1:37:01] and I
[1:37:04] was a wretched.
[1:37:06] I remember who I was.
[1:37:10] I was lost. I was blind.
[1:37:15] I was running out of time.
[1:37:19] The sin
[1:37:21] separated
[1:37:24] the preach
[1:37:28] from the far side of the cast.
[1:37:33] You held me in your side
[1:37:37] and you
[1:37:39] made a way
[1:37:41] across the great divine.
[1:37:45] left behind heaven's throne
[1:37:50] and built it here inside.
[1:37:54] And there
[1:37:57] the cross
[1:37:59] you gave the dead I
[1:38:03] hope my chains free my soul
[1:38:07] for the first time I am.
[1:38:12] Oh, thank you Jesus
[1:38:16] for the blood
[1:38:18] of

[1:38:27] me.

[1:38:47] Hallelujah. And you
[1:38:51] took my place
[1:38:53] inside the tomb of Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:38:57] You were buried for three days.
[1:39:01] Hallelujah. But then you walked right
[1:39:03] out again.
[1:39:06] Now death
[1:39:08] has no ste
[1:39:10] and life has no way
[1:39:14] for I have been transformed
[1:39:19] by the blood of
[1:39:23] the
[1:39:26] Jesus
[1:39:27] for the blood of my hallelujah.
[1:39:32] Hallelujah
[1:39:34] Jesus
[1:39:36] you have washed me high.
[1:39:40] Thank you Jesus

[1:39:49] you brought me out of darkness
[1:39:53] to glory.
[1:39:57] Hallelujah.
[1:39:59] Oh, there is nothing stronger
[1:40:04] than the one working power of the
[1:40:12] beloved
[1:40:16] that all the sons and daughters
[1:40:20] we are ransom are the father through the
[1:40:25] blood.
[1:40:28] the blood.
[1:40:32] Oh, there is nothing stronger.
[1:40:36] Hallelujah. And the wonder
[1:40:40] the blood.
[1:40:44] The blood
[1:40:48] that called the sons and daughters.
[1:40:52] We are ransified the father through the
[1:40:57] blood.
[1:41:00] The blood.
[1:41:05] Oh, thank you Jesus
[1:41:09] for the blood of
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:13] Thank you Jesus.
[1:41:17] You have washed me white.
[1:41:22] Thank you Jesus.
[1:41:25] You have saved my life.
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:30] You brought me out of darkness
[1:41:34] to glorious.
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:39] I'm thankful for that today.
[1:41:42] We don't deserve to be here.
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:49] None of us deserve to be here.
[1:41:53] None of us deserve to listen to hear
[1:41:55] this message.
[1:41:59] None of us deserve to know and
[1:42:01] understand the depths of God's word.
[1:42:05] But it's because God has provided a way.
[1:42:11] Now listen,
[1:42:15] every man will have to pay for his own
[1:42:17] sin.
[1:42:18] Every man is responsible.
[1:42:22] It doesn't matter how good you are,
[1:42:25] how much you're liked by the community,
[1:42:28] you will go to hell
[1:42:32] if you don't
[1:42:35] take the light of God's word.
[1:42:38] Look in the mirror.
[1:42:42] you will not make it to heaven unless we
[1:42:45] use God's
[1:42:48] avenue.
[1:42:52] But when God has come and given us
[1:42:54] light,
[1:42:58] then we would be without excuse.
[1:43:02] And to be able to just come and feel his
[1:43:04] presence as we feel it here tonight,
[1:43:07] that's God's love. And if there's
[1:43:10] someone here that hasn't made their
[1:43:11] heart, haven't hasn't made that
[1:43:13] reservation yet. If there's someone here
[1:43:15] that maybe you've just not been real
[1:43:17] serious with your soul, the soul that
[1:43:20] sins will die eternally.
[1:43:26] Why don't you just
[1:43:29] maybe the word shown some light and you
[1:43:32] can say, "Oh my, I'm not as righteous as
[1:43:35] I thought I was.
[1:43:39] I guess I want to be right, why don't
[1:43:42] you just make your make your heart right
[1:43:44] with him tonight while there's blood.
[1:43:48] If there's someone here that maybe you
[1:43:52] you just looked at, yeah, I've gotten a
[1:43:56] little bit lax, a little bit lukewarm,
[1:43:59] just thank God for shining the light.
[1:44:00] Maybe maybe you've already made that
[1:44:02] reservation. You're just needing to
[1:44:05] You're just needing to do a little bit
[1:44:06] of scrubbing.
[1:44:10] Why don't you do that tonight?
[1:44:14] Whatever it is,
[1:44:16] if you're a sinner, you can leave a
[1:44:18] saint.
[1:44:20] If you came in lukewarm, you can leave
[1:44:22] on fire.
[1:44:26] That water labor right there is right
[1:44:28] there. Is is where we need to look. God,
[1:44:32] right there. right there at that gate in
[1:44:33] front of that spirit man. I I I'm asking
[1:44:37] that you help me to start running
[1:44:38] everything through that word. Help me,
[1:44:40] Lord. Amen.
[1:44:44] Father, we thank you
[1:44:48] as we feel your presence just settling
[1:44:50] among us.
[1:44:53] how we
[1:44:57] thank you for your word and
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:06] that light that shines upon us, Lord,
[1:45:11] it makes us look so small.
[1:45:14] We look so itty bitty
[1:45:18] and we can say it as the prophet.
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:23] What is man? He's nothing but a worm.
[1:45:25] And here God has chosen man to work
[1:45:30] through and to save.
[1:45:35] I can't understand it. I can't wrap my
[1:45:37] mind around.
[1:45:40] But all I can say is thank you.
[1:45:43] Thank you
[1:45:47] with the sincerest that I can. And Lord,
[1:45:51] I want to be more sincere. I I ask Lord
[1:45:54] that you take me.
[1:45:56] I'm opening my heart. I'm asking that
[1:45:58] you scrub me.
[1:46:01] I want to be sincere.
[1:46:04] I I want to be body, spirit, and soul
[1:46:07] yours.
[1:46:10] Oh God.
[1:46:14] Oh God, let your word shine upon us all.
[1:46:19] If there be someone, Lord, that hasn't
[1:46:21] just really made you theirs,
[1:46:25] they've not accepted,
[1:46:29] they've not given their life to you yet.
[1:46:32] I ask Lord as they invite you right now
[1:46:36] that you would come in,
[1:46:38] you would suck with them. you would
[1:46:40] start rearranging their house.
[1:46:46] Take them as their son and daughter.

[1:47:02] love.

[1:59:56] been dealing with the spiritfilled
[1:59:58] believers that sometimes we get those
[2:00:00] clogged up. And the devil tells you he
[2:00:03] ain't got the Holy Ghost. But but but
[2:00:06] I'm here to tell you,
[2:00:09] Brother Brandham, who had the Holy
[2:00:11] Ghost, disobeyed the Lord, went went
[2:00:15] with those preachers when God told him
[2:00:18] not to.
[2:00:21] And God went for six months,
[2:00:25] wouldn't talk to him.
[2:00:27] He separated himself
[2:00:30] from from the Lord. He paid for it. He
[2:00:33] was he he thought he was going to die,
[2:00:37] but he it was it was six months of just
[2:00:42] self inspection. God forgive me. God
[2:00:47] help me. God, you understanding? So the
[2:00:50] channel got blocked.
[2:00:52] It did not mean that he lost the Holy
[2:00:54] Ghost. It did not. But it simply meant
[2:00:57] that he was suffering because of the
[2:01:00] spirit man. He he went with his mind. He
[2:01:03] he he followed the guys when God told
[2:01:05] him. And man, God told him not to go
[2:01:08] with them.
[2:01:11] And so I what I'm saying is as many
[2:01:13] times
[2:01:15] spiritborn sons, daughters of God can
[2:01:18] disobey God. And and because you've done
[2:01:21] that, it has separated you. And Amen.
[2:01:27] But God does that because he wants you
[2:01:29] to know it's important. His word is
[2:01:32] important. His word is important. Can
[2:01:35] you say amen? So we go back to his word
[2:01:38] and we start scrubbing. Well, glory to
[2:01:41] God. Now, if there's someone that
[2:01:42] doesn't have the Holy Ghost, well, you
[2:01:44] need to get the Holy Ghost. That's that
[2:01:46] sanct justification, sanctification,
[2:01:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you'll
[2:01:50] never get there until you you God will
[2:01:52] never fill your vessel as long as you
[2:01:55] are justifying sin in your life. He'll
[2:01:58] never fill you. Amen. Is that right?
[2:02:04] Praise the Lord. Well, God bless you.
[2:02:07] Amen. Appreciate y'all. Appreciate your
[2:02:10] patience. Uh going a little bit over
[2:02:12] what we've been going. Amen. But I I
[2:02:15] felt my heart to go this way here
[2:02:17] tonight. And uh and so I trust it was a
[2:02:22] blessing for you.
[2:02:26] Amen.
[2:02:29] Praise the Lord.
