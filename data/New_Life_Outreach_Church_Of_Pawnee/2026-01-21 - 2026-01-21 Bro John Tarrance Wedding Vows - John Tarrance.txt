If he was a miracle worker 50 years ago, he's a miracle worker today. &gt;&gt; And I can believe in that. here tonight. As we go to prayer, I'm going to ask brother Michael if you'd mind coming and leading us in prayer. We do have a few needs here tonight. Um says from sister Carol, my niece um Carlina Carolene Caroline Carlen okay has multiple um autoimmune diseases. So let's remember her. And then my daughter uh Caroli has a uh what is that? RA. &gt;&gt; Okay. As RA with complications. So, let's remember them tonight. And then, Brother Dylan is not here with us. Um, I guess he was bit by a spider or something like that. So, he's had some streaks running up and down his arm. So, let's remember him. They took him in and I believe we're on the way back tonight. But, let's remember brother Dylan in our prayer. Um, if you have a need upon your heart, just make a known by the lifting of your hand. God bless you now. Amen. You love him here this evening. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're just so grateful to be here in your presence this evening. Lord, we're grateful, Lord, for all that you do for us in our lives. And God, the ability to be able to come to your place here and just worship you, Father. God, you see your people, Lord, how they just diligently come, Lord, to hear your word and just give you worship. I would just ask that you would just bless them, Lord. Father, you see those that aren't here and those that we're lifting up in prayer or or sister Carol that's praying for Carlina who has multiple uh autoimmune disease. Father, I would just ask that you would just be with her request, Lord. And I would just ask that you would just be with uh the other requests that she has, Father, and you see Dylan that's had the spider bite, Father. I would just pray, God, that you would be with Dylan, Lord, that everything would check out okay and you he would just come out all right, Lord, and just pray that you would be with him, Father. You see the hands that are in this building, Lord, and I would just pray that you would be with them, be with our speaker this evening, Father, and we just be careful to give you the glory and honor in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him here tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be minor, I believe. I see a cloud like a man's hand. Oh, I see a clown like a man's hand. Oh, and I see a cloud like a man's hand. And I know it's going to rain. Can we do verse one now? At a time when it was dry, not a cloud in the sky, the children of God get the reason why. So they went to God's man because they didn't understand. Go look, it's written in the sky. Now when I see a cloud like a man's head, oh I see a cloud like a man's head. Oh, and I see a cloud like a man's head. And I know it's going to rain. So they open up the door. The seventh time they looked once more, a tiny cloud was rising from the sea. Then they began to understand that a heavy rain was at hand. Oh, just like God said it would be. How about it tonight? Well, now I see a clown. Yes, I do. Oh, and I see a cloud I commanded. Oh, and I see &gt;&gt; and I know it's going to rain. I love this verse. So today we have no fear. We know a clouded up here. The promise scream, "My bride, go through that door. Oh, have faith and just believe. God's spirit you'll receive. Yes. Just about to pour. Oh, I see a clown. Thank you, Lord. And I see a cloud like a man's head. Oh, and I see a cloud like a man's hair. Oh, and I know it's going to rain. Singing out his brother Mike King comes and I see a clown. Yes, I do. Oh, I see a clown like a man's head. Oh, and I see a thou like a man's hand. And I know it's going to rain. Do you believe that tonight? Hallelujah. How many's come with their cups raised up to the sky? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As brother David Gapman says, "Not bringing just a cup, but backing up my truck." Amen. I believe the Lord can pour out a spirit here tonight. Amen. God bless you now. &gt;&gt; Even though my spirit is low and it seems I can hardly go, but still I see victory. And at times I'm walking by faith. Can't see what lies before me. But still I see victory. Oh, I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by the blood. You may snare and you may fight. You're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, you can't cross the bloodline. Sometimes the battle gets hard. It seems we're fighting a lot. I remember I'm standing on the rock. So Satan, if I were you, I'd turn around and give up to I believe you're bound to lose. Oh, I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by the blood. You may snare and you may fight. You're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, you can't cross the bloodline. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the battle gets hard. It seems we're fighting a lot. I remember I'm standing on the wrong Satan. If I were you, I'd turn around and give up to I believe you're bound to lose. I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by the blood. You may snare and you may fight. You're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, you can't cross the bloodline. I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by the blood. You may snare and you may fight. You're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, you can't cross the blood line. You must remember you can't cross the bloodline. I hope you enjoy that tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. for it reaches to the highest mountain. Sister Kaylee, do you all have a song tonight? And it flows to the lowest valley. Oh, it's the blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose its power. Sing it now as they come for it reaches their God. It reaches to the highest mountain. Oh, and it flows to the lowest valley. It's the blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose. Oh, it will never sing it again. for it will never lose his power. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. God bless you now. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I know what it's like. to be in the presence of the Lord and not know what time it is. Because time stood still and bodies were healed. families restored because we stayed here in the presence of the Lord. No one had to say a word. Couldn't even make a sound. But I'd give up everything for this treure I found. found. I never wanted to end. Stay. I don't want you to go cuz my heart is burning in your presence. Oh, please stay. I don't want you to go. Cuz my heart is burning in your presence. Lord, I know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord and not know what time it is. Because time stood still. Bies were healed and families restored &gt;&gt; because we stayed here in the presence of the Lord. I want more. I want more. I want more. Jesus, I want more. I want more. I want more. I want more. More Jesus, I want more. I want more. I want more. I want more, Jesus. I want more. I want more. I want more. I want more. Oh Jesus, I want more. &gt;&gt; So I'll stay. Where else would I go? &gt;&gt; My heart is burning in your presence, Lord. So, I'll stay. Where else could I go? My heart is burning in your presence, Lord. Amen. Is your heart burning tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we can we can meet him here tonight. Amen. As the man of God comes, can we sing this? Draw me close to you. Never let me go. I lay it all down again. To hear you say that I'm your friend. You are my desire and you are my desire. Yes, Lord. No one else will do. No one else will do. No one else can take your place. to feel the warmth of your embrace. Help me find a way. Help me find a way. Bring me back to you. You're all I want. You're all I want. Is that your desire tonight? Yes, Lord. You're all I've ever needed. You're all I want. Help me know you. Sing it now as the man of God comes. You're all I want. Yes, Lord. You're all I want. Can you just lift a hand and and sing it to him tonight as a prayer? You're all I've ever needed. You're all I want. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish I knew that song. I'd sing it with you all. Amen. It's a beautiful song, but I don't know it. So, I'm just going to let them play it for a minute. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's an honor to be in the house of God again. &gt;&gt; It's an honor to be able to stand behind this sacred desk and be trusted with the word of God one more time. You know, that's one of the the greatest things to me is the trust given to someone to handle the word. You know, uh but by the grace of God, we'll say what he'll have us to say. Amen. But it truly is an honor and it's good to see you all again. Uh if you'll open your Bibles to Revelations chap 21, we'll start at verse one. You know, one of the greatest times of my day is getting home, walking into the house, and there's my wife. You know, she's cleaning, cooking, even griping. Sorry, dear. But it's still the highlight of my day. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You know, cuz every morning that we get up and we go to work and we do what we have to do and fight what we have to fight, it's for her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's for the kids. It's not for me. You know, I I could handle a box somewhere, a little bitty old cabin out in the mountains and nothing. It I don't do it for me. I do it for her. You know it. It's still a few months away, but we're coming up on our 26th anniversary. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. We don't look that old, do we? Amen. Well, she don't anyway. I do, but she don't. She gets younger every day. I get older. Amen. But uh but I I still want to know more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to know what she's thinking. I want to know what she's feeling. I want to know everything about her day. And sometimes I'll just sit there and let her talk. And she talks and then finally she's like, "You're not saying nothing." I was like, "I know. I like to hear you talk." And it's the truth. I'm not lying. You know, and so maybe, just maybe, brother, if I finally ended up with a title for you, I'm going to call it wedding vows. &gt;&gt; Uh it's one of the most sacred things I believe I've in this world. I mean, the most sacred thing is Jesus Christ, but in this world, I think the most sacred thing that I've ever said was my wedding vows. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; I meant them. Every word of them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I won't break them. &gt;&gt; Try my best not to. You know what I mean? I think I think the wedding and vows are the most wonderful thing &gt;&gt; two humans &gt;&gt; can do. Vow to actually love each other for the rest of your life. It's amazing. But we get it honest because we get it from the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, Revelations chapter 21. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away." And he that sat upon the throne said, the one that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new, and he said unto me, right, for these words are true and faithful. &gt;&gt; Oh, dear heavenly father, Lord, we're so thankful for your word tonight, Lord. It means so much to us when you take the time to speak to us, Lord. And we appreciate your time and your mercy in your presence, Father. Lord, I ask you to move me out of the way one more time, Lord, and come down and and say something to your people, Lord, for you know what they need. I don't. So, Lord, I ask you to take control in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Y'all can get comfortable if you want. Amen. So that it's kind of weird to to to read that and then have a title of wedding vows and Lord willing it'll all come together. Amen. &gt;&gt; But all through this we we know that the Bible is a love letter. &gt;&gt; It's a love letter from the beginning of the Bible to the end of the Bible. It's a love letter to you and to me. It tells us all about our husband. &gt;&gt; It tell us tells us all about the one that loved us so much that he chose to redeem us back to him. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Not as servants, not not as uh someone lesser than not then. No, he redeemed us back to him. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Setting us on the throne with him. &gt;&gt; Right? And then he wanted to make sure that we stayed with him so much that he made the vow to himself. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He didn't he didn't leave it, you know, to to chance. He didn't leave it to anything. He looked ahead and he saw us and he loved us so much that he put it in his word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Everything in his word &gt;&gt; and then turned around and said, "Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word &gt;&gt; will never pass away." Right. &gt;&gt; So his redemption and his love for us, he put it into one thing that will never pass away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then he said that word will be made flesh. And we know Christ was word made flesh. But brothers and sisters, you and I are word made flesh. &gt;&gt; So if we're word made flesh and he's word made flesh and the word will never pass away, brothers and sisters, neither will we. Now, these bodies may pass away, but that soul that he sealed inside of us through the Holy Spirit will never pass away. And he vowed that to himself. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will make a way." &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will come down. I will be your God. You will be my people." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. He He didn't just redeem us back. to be slaves. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm not a slave to this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm not This is not my taskmaster. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I've been freed from my task masters. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The ones that made me crawl at home through my own puke from the drinking, &gt;&gt; that was task masters. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, this is freedom. &gt;&gt; Amen. He redeemed me back to freedom. He redeemed me back to who I am. He redeemed me back to love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You ever heard that expression? You know, only a face that a mother can love. That was said about me a lot, but it is an expression, right? But he freed us from that and brought us back to something that even when the world looks at it, even though they gripe about it and yell and holler and scoff and all that, when they need something, where do they go? &gt;&gt; Because they love what God's given you as much as you love what's God given you. And they search for it and they look for it. The only problem is is they don't realize it's sitting right in front of them. The whole world is making space stations and space shuttles and everything because they're saying there's got to be beings in the heaven. There's got to be other people. There's got to be another race. There's got to be all these things. And what they don't realize is it's already here. &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. I'm a heavenly being. I've been redeemed back to who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not earthly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm heavenly. &gt;&gt; So, what they're out in the stars looking for is right here. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; They're searching for something out there in the heavens when the heavens has come down to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they missed it. &gt;&gt; Just like they missed Christ then, they're missing it now. And it's our job to tell them. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read you a quote here that that I really really really like and I know it's a it's a uh very common quote out of the seven church ages, but I'm going to read it anyways because sometimes it's said one way when it's actually written another. So, so we're going to read it. says, "Now remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. But the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, &gt;&gt; making it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. &gt;&gt; It exposes Satan, revealing his works, attempted destruction of God's people, and the discrediting of God's word, right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows. This is Satan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if he knows, we ought to know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is, what she stands for, and that she can do the greater works, she will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. what she is. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is probably gonna get me in trouble. There's a lot of whats we can be. There's a lot of watts that can stand for. But I know one thing, brothers and sisters. God redeemed you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Brought you to him. Set you in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He has the throne prepared for us to sit on beside him. Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. And if he's the king &gt;&gt; and we're going to sit on the throne and rule with him, what does that make us? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Well, we're the feminine side of Christ, right? &gt;&gt; So, what you are &gt;&gt; is the queen of heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, the heavenly beings that they're looking for is here. &gt;&gt; What we are is the queen of heaven. Brother Brandham said, "I no longer call you church. I call you bride." &gt;&gt; He didn't say fiance. &gt;&gt; He said bride. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So if we're married to the king, right? &gt;&gt; And this is the marriage right now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So if we're married to him, then what we are is the queen. &gt;&gt; So everything that's under his feet is under your feet. &gt;&gt; Everything. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, Satan is under your feet. &gt;&gt; Even in Genesis when he told Adam, he said, "I give you dominion over everything." And then he put it in there because he knew Satan was coming. He said, "Even the creepy crawly things." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Which is Satan and his demons if you want. That's my opinion. But &gt;&gt; the creepy crawly things, everything you have dominion over it all. And we've been restored back. Now, have we got to the fullness of that yet? No. what &gt;&gt; I mean it's coming. It can be any minute. &gt;&gt; It can be any time. &gt;&gt; But then he turned around in his love letter and said, "I'm going to give you an earnest to that." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you your healing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm the God that heals all of your diseases. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; By my stripes, you are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? It's done. It's in the word. The word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everything else will pass away, but the word can't. So, your healing is a done deal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's no question about it. It &gt;&gt; It may be 25 years before you see the promise, but your healing is done. &gt;&gt; But what you can't do is live like it's going to be 25 years. &gt;&gt; Deal with them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. I I've heard it said and and it and it actually hurts me. Almost makes me want to cry when people say, "Well, I don't know. I'm just gonna maybe have to live with this like Paul. Maybe this is the thorn in my side to keep me humble." &gt;&gt; I'm like, "No, that's not what my God said." &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; my God didn't say, "I'm going to heal you from everything, but &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; that ain't what he said. He said, I'm God and I heal all of your diseases." So, it's already done because then he said, "By my stripes, ye are healed." Not you will be, you are healed. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then &gt;&gt; he gave us his blood for our salvation, for the forgiveness of sins. It's all there. Nothing can stop us. Nothing can keep us away from it but us. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And now that that that one hurts, I know. But it's the truth. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because we go into this and sometimes it takes a while. Brother Brandham said sometimes it's miracles and sometimes it's healing and sometimes that healing takes a while. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; he said that. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But whenever Noah was in the floods. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. and it rained for 40 days and 40 nights and then I believe it was 110 days later before the water actually receded. Right? So on the 111th day he opened it up and there was dry ground and they were able to come off the boat. Right? But what would have happened if he'd have got tired of it and stepped off of it at 98 days. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; What would have happened if he'd have just gave up, opened up all the doors, let the animals roam free and go? He would have missed the whole point of the boat. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they would have all died. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he didn't. He waited on God. He held to it. But every time he sent out a dove, &gt;&gt; it would come back. Nope, not yet. And he would wait a little bit. Then he'd be like, "Today's the day." And he would send out the dove. And the dove came back. But he lived like that was the day that the water was gone. &gt;&gt; Okay. When Elijah come back into the mountains and he was all upset and he wandered around and I believe even it was 40 days that he wandered around before he finally found himself back into a cave. And inside that cave was when he heard the still small voice of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But he didn't give up. He kept going around. He kept listening. He heard the all of the wind and all that stuff. He didn't give up. He kept listening. He kept talking to God. He kept &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't go and go and go and then put the brakes on and say, "Well, it's just not my time because no, you just reset it." &gt;&gt; You just reset the whole thing. And you've got to now build your faith all the way back up again. All right. &gt;&gt; Live every single day like that's the day the miracle happens. That's the day &gt;&gt; God's going to move. That's the day the rapture is going to happen. That's the day the fulfillment's going to be. And the only way you can do that is stay in the presence of God 247, 365 days a year. &gt;&gt; All right? we don't have time to deviate and step out and move somewhere else because when you do that's when this can be attacked and then you're like oh well maybe and as soon as you do &gt;&gt; clock resets &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; every single day of our life should be lived like that's the day we're going home &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; yes I have to go to work bills have to be paid food has to be put on the table. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I get that. But the whole time I'm at work, I'm like, "Come on. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. It's six o'clock somewhere." Brother Brandham said between 6:00 and 9. I know it's 5:00, but it's six o'clock somewhere. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, there's different time zones all over this world. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He said between 6:00 and 9 in the morning. I mean, that could be 6:00 and 9 Hawaii time. That could be 6:00 to 9 China time. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, it it could be 6:00 to 9 in the morning. Now, it's probably 6:00 to 9 US time. I don't know. I'm not going to live my life today like it's going to be six o'clock in the morning. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Every minute of my night tonight's going to be in prayer like I'm going to wake up at my wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, it it could happen at midnight. I don't know. I know what Brother Brandham said. and I will, but I'm going to live my life as though every minute is the last minute on this earth. &gt;&gt; So when I need my healing, &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand upon the word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand upon the promises as though that is a done deal. It doesn't matter. I've been blind since I was a year and a half old in one eye. &gt;&gt; But you can't tell me I don't have two eyes. &gt;&gt; All right. My God said, "I have two eyes." &gt;&gt; So, even the guys at work, they come up to me and they're like, "Well, you know what?" And I look at them and I say, "No, I have two perfectly good eyes." And they're like, "Come on, man." No, I'm serious. My God said, "I had two perfectly good eyes." And let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only just the truth, he said it's faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's faithful. &gt;&gt; If it's faithful, that means he's not going to forget it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he he &gt;&gt; glor. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says that Noah and them was out there on the water and they were doing all that and then the Bible says he remembered Noah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he's faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; He remembered Noah. So he's like, "Oo, better time to get the water off, you know." But then he didn't do it like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, the rain stopped, everything done. It was still, I believe, 110 days later, something like that. 150 days total. I could be wrong with those numbers. Forgive me if I am. But it still took a while. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Moses was in the wilderness for 40 years. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The whole, you know, and we know how that went and everybody died off and the new generation come in. But but the point of that is if everybody would have given up in year 39 and just started building houses and everything right there like Gad did, you know, the tribe of Gad actually did that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They decided, you know what, just let us stay on this side. We're tired of this. &gt;&gt; They gave up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let that be me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because had they had just waited until the 41st year &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; If they had stood on it one more year, &gt;&gt; they'd have made it into the promised land. They would have received their promise. &gt;&gt; If they wouldn't have given up, &gt;&gt; the Bible says over and over and over again, "Hold fast to that which is good. Hold fast to that which you have. Hold fast. Hold fast." You can't hold fast and give up at the same time. It doesn't work. You can't hold the line and back up at the same time. Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And believe it or not, it's our job to hold the line. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You see, in any kingdom where there's a king and a queen, you have the king who fights the battles, &gt;&gt; he goes to war. Look how many times David would went to war. And when he did stay back, he got himself in trouble. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Right. But they would go out and battle the enemy. They would fight the fights. They built things. They fought. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the queens were the humanitarians. &gt;&gt; The queens are the one that went out and fed the poor. The queens were the w ones that went out to see how things were going if they were good queens. &gt;&gt; The queen was the one that took care of the people. And we're the queen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's why we pray for people. That's why we go out into the highways and the byways and preach this gospel. We're the humanitarian part of this. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We're the queen. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. Everything in this scripture that God wrote for you was his wedding vows. &gt;&gt; Do you get that? &gt;&gt; Cuz when we get over there to the wedding supper, we won't need the healing anymore. &gt;&gt; We won't need the salvation anymore. We'll be there in the new bodies without all of that stuff. But he knew we were marrying here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he wrote this book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As vows &gt;&gt; for our wedding. &gt;&gt; He vowed it to himself and said, "This I promise to you." &gt;&gt; Okay. If you'll say I do &gt;&gt; if you'll surrender your life to me. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; This I'll give to you. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's his wedding vows, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's not just a love letter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's your wedding vows. &gt;&gt; It is your promise of what he's going to do, what he has done, and what he will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right? &gt;&gt; The same as a husband and a wife. &gt;&gt; When you make those vows, they're very serious. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it's better to what? Hang a millstone around your neck and go drown than it is to break one of them. Any vow that you make. &gt;&gt; Wedding vows are what holds the two together. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. &gt;&gt; For life, &gt;&gt; and we're eternal. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir. So these are wedding vows that keep us redeemed and with God for eternity. No wonder Paul could come back and say that I am persuaded that nothing &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; absolutely nothing can take me away from the love of God because he vowed it. &gt;&gt; He promised it. He gave it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then just to make sure that he wasn't being unjust, he had himself tempted in the wilderness to make sure that he would know exactly what we were going through when we came to him crying. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, there's nothing new under the sun. The Bible says that &gt;&gt; there's nothing new under the sun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, if there's nothing new under the sun and God knows all things, &gt;&gt; no matter what we're going through, he's felt it. He's been through it. &gt;&gt; He has won. &gt;&gt; Glor. &gt;&gt; So when he comes back to you and says, "My word says &gt;&gt; my vows say you can stand on that instantly." &gt;&gt; Not &gt;&gt; not, "Oh well, tomorrow." No, instantly you can stand on that vow and say this is done. &gt;&gt; You can say today this scripture is fulfilled. Today I am healed. Today I am saved. Today I am delivered. I am no longer a drunk. I no longer smoke. I no longer do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when you make the mistakes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His blood is sufficient. &gt;&gt; He sealed his vows to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. with his own blood. &gt;&gt; He didn't just get out his wax and heat it up and pour it on it and put a royal seal on it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; That's what earthly kingdoms do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That ain't what he did. &gt;&gt; He said, "This is going to be permanent." &gt;&gt; I'm eternal. I'm going to make my vows eternal. &gt;&gt; And he not only soaked us, &gt;&gt; but even the scriptures are covered in blood. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sealed it with his own blood &gt;&gt; and then sealed us with his blood &gt;&gt; and then gave us a new heart. Gave us a new spirit &gt;&gt; so that we could even accept it &gt;&gt; because he loves you. Now, when I look back on my life and all the things I've done and and I won't go through it. I know I've I've told my testimony a few times. When you look back on that all honesty, you know, I don't deserve this. I'll just put it bluntly. &gt;&gt; None of us do. But I can tell you right now, I I don't deserve this. I was a liar, a thief, a cheat, a drunk, a drug addict. There there ain't much in that bad stuff that I didn't do. Not that I'm trying to lift it up. I'm just telling you there is nothing that God cannot forgive. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that God cannot wipe away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is absolutely nothing, &gt;&gt; bless the Lord, &gt;&gt; that any of us have done &gt;&gt; that he won't say, "I don't remember it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Which makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because when Satan comes back to me laying there in the middle of the night and he says, "I don't even know what you try." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you're going to make it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look at what you've done. &gt;&gt; Look at what you've said. &gt;&gt; Look at the way you treated your mother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look at the way you treated your father. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Honor your mother and father. &gt;&gt; You didn't do that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you wake up at 3:00 in the morning crying going, "Lord," and then you have to remember. &gt;&gt; He don't remember it. &gt;&gt; Under the blood. &gt;&gt; It's under the blood. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And he gave me wedding vows telling me that it would never come out. &gt;&gt; I can take this and judge myself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now by this word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was explained to us by a prophet. So we know what we was reading. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and I can judge myself by this and not have to worry about a judgment later &gt;&gt; now. If that isn't love, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's like, I'm going to love you so much. &gt;&gt; I'm going to completely take you out of the equation and set you over here. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; You just trust me. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the hard one, ain't it? &gt;&gt; You just trust me. &gt;&gt; When the bills are piling up and life's in chaos, doctors say this is wrong and that's wrong and all that. We have to trust him. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He's our husband. He vowed to take care of us. &gt;&gt; He vowed we would want for nothing. He would give us everything that we needed. He said he would give us the desires of our heart because he knew him before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So there ain't nothing that we need that he hasn't already provided for &gt;&gt; as long as we don't give up too soon. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; We we can't Joshua. He had Joshua tell the people, "Sanctify yourself today &gt;&gt; because tomorrow you're going to see the glory of God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But sanctify yourself today. In other words, sanctifying yourself means getting rid of sin, right? Well, the only way to get rid of the sin is to get rid of the unbelief. So, if you want to sanctify yourself, then you have to get rid of the unbelief. You have to trust &gt;&gt; in God. &gt;&gt; You have to trust that the blood is enough. You have to trust that it's all right here. And you have to trust him when he says it's faithful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like &gt;&gt; your wife trusts you and you trust your wife. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because spiritually speaking, he is our husband. As a bride adornneth herself for her husband. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But what do we adorn oursel in? The word. &gt;&gt; Yes. We have no righteousness of our own. Abraham's faith was counted to him as righteousness. So faith in what? What God said? Faith in this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you trust him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you trust somebody that willingly left his holy of holy of holiest holiest place in the heavens? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come down to earth, put himself in a body, walked himself up to the cross, willingly spread out his hands, and died for you. Can you trust that man? &gt;&gt; Can you trust that God? &gt;&gt; Okay. And and I'm I'm really saying this this trust because if you don't, you will stop on day 39. &gt;&gt; And your healing was coming on day 40. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You got to trust every single day that this is the day for the miracle. This is the day for the vow to be held up. &gt;&gt; This is the day. Not tomorrow. Not tonight. Not after we get home. Not because brother Wayne is coming, which is wonderful and we're all going to be blessed and miracles are going to happen. I guarantee it. &gt;&gt; Because I expect it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because I'm living every single minute of my life in the presence of God, expecting miracles, expecting the supernatural, expecting it. Why? because he promised it and I trust him to be faithful for that he vowed to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't just promise it. He vowed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't just say, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I promise. I promise. I promise." He's like, "No." He's like, "I'm going to do this by my blood and by my word, and my word will never pass away. this is going to happen no matter what. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I mean, if you can't trust in that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm God and I change not." &gt;&gt; So, if he doesn't change &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he done it then and he done it for back in the, you know, the original Pentecost days. He done it. &gt;&gt; Healings and miracles, brothers and sisters, went through every single age. &gt;&gt; Sure did. Sure. &gt;&gt; You know, healings and all that followed every movement because that's that's the sign. And these signs will follow them that believe. Yeah. They didn't have the whole word, but they had enough. &gt;&gt; They had enough to have faith in what they knew. And the faith in what they knew created that. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, the healing and all that came came to pass when they didn't have the full revelation. They only had a portion. They had a small light. They looked through the glass and they couldn't quite see what was coming, but they had faith and trust enough that the miracles still happened. &gt;&gt; They they had enough faith in Jehovah that miracles happened under the blood of bulls and goats &gt;&gt; and lambs, &gt;&gt; you know. Yeah, the prophets did. I mean, they even raised, you know, children from the dead. the miracles and stuff, they should be second nature to us &gt;&gt; honestly. &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; So don't give up because it's been a minute. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Well, I don't know." Well, maybe. No, &gt;&gt; you are healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are &gt;&gt; saved. &gt;&gt; You are delivered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because he said it. Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and ye shall receive it. So if you don't have it, get down on your knees until he gives it to you because it's yours. &gt;&gt; You just haven't followed through. Right. &gt;&gt; You haven't followed through. &gt;&gt; It's there. &gt;&gt; He's already given it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He can't give it twice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm persuaded that nothing can take me from the love of God. If he's given it to you, he's given it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's given you, you're healing, brother. You're healed regardless &gt;&gt; of circumstance. Regardless of what you see, regardless of what the doctors tell you, regardless of what your body does, &gt;&gt; regardless of any of that, you're healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he comes to you and gives you that revelation in your heart that you are delivered from alcohol and drugs, no matter the cravings, no matter the withdrawals and the shaking and the kicking and the fighting, you're delivered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; No. No matter that voice that comes into your head saying, "Well, this ain't for you." Well, if he's telling you it's not for you, then that ought to make it pretty sure to you it's for you. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he wouldn't bother telling you it ain't. &gt;&gt; He's not going to Why would he bother telling his own child that something He knows they're not going to go for it anyway. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's not after them. He's after us. And that's why he tells us and that's why he makes it easy for the doubt to sink in. He He makes it easy because we're human. &gt;&gt; We're heavenly creatures stuck in a human body and our whole life is spent finding the easiest way to do stuff. &gt;&gt; It is. Where do you think our technology come from? &gt;&gt; We decided we didn't like walking and running, so we started riding horses. It was faster. It was easier. Well, then we decided even that wasn't good enough. So, we come up with cars and those won't weren't fast enough. So, we come up with even faster cars. And then we got trains and planes and spaceships because it's easy. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's easier. It's easier to get a C in school than do your best and get the A you know you can get. &gt;&gt; Which gets me because we should do the best at everything we're do. We're children of God. &gt;&gt; All right. I I tell you what, and this is going to be kind of blunt, but I'm glad my God didn't get seized. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When my God done something, he was the best at it. &gt;&gt; No questions asked. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if we're a part of him, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; we'll give everything we got, too. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if a C is the best that you can do, well, praise the Lord. But if you can do better, do better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have told my kids and especially Colton, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter if you agree to do something for a dollar or a $100, you do it the best you can because you said you would do it. You agreed to do it. &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't matter how much you're getting paid. And if the guy sitting next to you is making three times you are, you had better outwork that guy. &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That one was free. But Lord help me. They're wedding vows and he holds us to a standard. That's why he gives us little things in here. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not. &gt;&gt; Don't do this. Do this. &gt;&gt; It's not because he's a jailer. It's because he's given us the freedom to live this life. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And know when to stop, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To know how to act. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because as queens, &gt;&gt; we are ambassadors. &gt;&gt; I studied kings and queens kingdoms. The queen is always the one. The king went and fought. Nobody wanted the king to come. They wanted a diplomat. They wanted the queen. &gt;&gt; We are the ambassador to the world. &gt;&gt; We are the one that says our God is true freedom. Okay. &gt;&gt; But how would we know how to explain that if he didn't tell us don't do this, don't do that, this is right, this is wrong. &gt;&gt; How could he redeem us from our sins if there wasn't nothing to tell us what our sins were? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; It's come on. &gt;&gt; It's not dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I when I was young, that's what I thought and I was like, I'm going to I can't live that. I'm going to live my life any old way I can. And boy did that come back to haunt me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't want to live this life your way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You really don't. &gt;&gt; But if you live it God's way, you can walk this earth and not worry about sickness. &gt;&gt; You can walk this earth and not worry about losing. You can live on this earth because we have to until we get out of it without any care &gt;&gt; in this world because he said this was right. Therefore, it's right. &gt;&gt; So, as long as I'm under the blood of Jesus Christ and I am doing my best to do the leading of the Lord, I am going to be okay. And if that ain't freedom, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; All right. I don't know what is. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; To me, that's freedom. &gt;&gt; You know, we always say, teach your kids boundaries. That way, they can be free within the boundaries. They know what they're supposed to do. Well, isn't that what that's teaching us? &gt;&gt; Boundaries. &gt;&gt; It's teaching us how to live our lives with honesty and integrity. &gt;&gt; How to live our lives as children of the king. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be worthy to be called a queen. &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it, but he gave it to me. &gt;&gt; He married me. He gave me his vows. &gt;&gt; And I can be free. I can be free to be quiet. I can be free to say nothing. &gt;&gt; I can be free to love my wife and know what real love is. &gt;&gt; I can be free to know when I'm getting real love in return. &gt;&gt; Not something fake, not something because you can tell when you stay in the presence of God and you stay in the scriptures and you stay in the message, believe it or not, the uncertain sound, you'll hear it. &gt;&gt; When somebody comes up to you and starts talking, you'll be like, "Something's wrong with that. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Whether it's scripture or not, you'll know when a car salesman starts telling trying to sell you a bad car. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will come up and say, "Whoa." &gt;&gt; You know, something don't sound right about what he's saying. &gt;&gt; I mean, he will. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham said, "Stay neutral. Follow the leading of the Lord. Don't pray one way or the other. &gt;&gt; And just be neutral and say, "Lord, whatever you want." And then as he starts leading you one way, go into that. But wait. Then if he still feel like he's leading it to you, then wait and then do it. I mean, that that's what he said. We and April looked it up the other night. I thought that was awesome because every other time he said, "Don't be neutral. Don't be neutral." You know, you get the word of God, don't be neutral. You have healing, don't be neutral. Don't set on the fence and go, "Well, maybe." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But in that one spot when you pray, be neutral. That's awesome. &gt;&gt; Every word, by the way. &gt;&gt; Yes. We have to be married to him now. &gt;&gt; There's no getting around it. We must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; that's blunt, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; there ain't time left in this world. And I know every age has said that. Preachers have said that for as long as I can remember. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you look at the world now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Versus the when we were kids. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And you see the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't let it go any longer or he would have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; and then apologize to them. &gt;&gt; But he's never wrong. &gt;&gt; So the time is short. really really short. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, it can be 50 years. That short, &gt;&gt; but I have a feeling it's more like tomorrow. Tonight, &gt;&gt; maybe before we get done with this service, &gt;&gt; okay? We must, we must, we must, we must have the Holy Spirit now &gt;&gt; because that is the only thing &gt;&gt; that is going to make this live to get us out of here. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is what makes this a living word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Without the Holy Spirit, we can quote it. We can read it. We can run with it. We can tell everybody. We can do all this stuff. And believe it or not, &gt;&gt; you may make it to heaven, but it won't be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; And that's hard. But I'm not going to apologize for it because it's the truth. So if you remotely think that there's a chance &gt;&gt; that you don't have that Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; don't stop until you get it. &gt;&gt; That's true, brother. &gt;&gt; And that brings us all the way back around to the start of this. I love to hear my wife talk. And I know she thinks I'm nuts. She thinks I'm crazy. She's like, "Yeah, you're not listening." No, I'm listening. I hear every word she says. So does God. He loves it when you ask him. &gt;&gt; He loves it when you talk to him. He loves it when you tell him your problems. He already knows him. He's already has the fix for him. But he absolutely loves it. Basically, when you complain to him, when you gripe to him about this and about that and Lord, I don't know what's going on. I need your help. This is happening. That's happening. He's like, "Don't worry. I've got it all in control." And you say, "Yeah, I know. I trust you. I just needed to get it off my chest. Right? He's your husband. He loves it. So if there's a chance, a remote chance, don't stop bugging him until he gives it to you. &gt;&gt; Don't stop crying for it. Don't stop reaching for it. Don't stop asking for it &gt;&gt; just because you're like, "Well, I've been asking for six months." Then ask another month. That may be the month you needed. &gt;&gt; All right. Never ever stop asking and never stop believing that today is the day he vowed it right here, right now. &gt;&gt; He said, "You are my wife and I am your husband and I bow to you. You are healed. You are delivered. You are saved. You have the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; He said, "I shall get it." So to me, that means I've got it because if I shall get it, then he already gave it to me before the foundation of the world. So, don't stop asking for it until you know that you know that you know and you're like, "Well, brother, how do I know?" Because you will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your desires have changed, your wants are changed, your thoughts are changed, your movements have changed, the way you walk a change. The way I walk, look at Jacob. Yes. Because you will no longer walk toward this. You'll walk toward him. You'll no longer walk toward the bar. You'll walk to church. You'll no longer And you'll want to &gt;&gt; see there's the kicker. You'll want to, brother. There'll be something inside of you that burns so much that if you don't bust through the doors of them church, you're going to bust &gt;&gt; that desire that's in you. But you we cannot leave it if the musicians come. &gt;&gt; We cannot leave it to Sunday and Wednesday. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we can't just serve God two days a week. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we can't just believe two days a week. And we can't just put it off until this and put it off until that. It's now today. &gt;&gt; Whatever that you need. &gt;&gt; Whatever that you need, he has already given it to you. &gt;&gt; But are you going to stay in his presence long enough to get it? Are you going to stay in his presence long enough to see the fulfillment of his word? You say, "Well, brother, I've been believing a long time." Well, just keep believing. &gt;&gt; I've been at this a long time. Just keep believing because today is the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you can say that every day and it still be the truth. Today's the day. because I had well my mom told me one time I was upset about something and I was like well mom it don't matter I've gone up for prayer for my eyes you know I've gone up for prayer I've gone up for pray it never happened so I don't really need two eyes I ain't going to worry about it she said son you went up for prayer for healing I was like yeah mom I did she said well how do you know he didn't heal you from some bug that was going to kill you. How do you know he didn't heal you for something in your body that you had no idea was in there? And I thought about that and then dismissed it, kids, right? But as I grow older, I got to realize it. When you ask God for something and he gives it to you, don't expect it your way. Expect it his way. It's yours. And today's the day and his mercies are new every day as the brother preached every single morning. So no matter how much Satan comes at us and no matter what he throws at us and no matter what we feel like, no matter what our bodies say, no matter what any of that happens. I've been blind in one eye supposedly by doctors since I was 15 months old. But even if I never see it, I will believe every day of my life that I have two perfectly good eyes &gt;&gt; because he said it &gt;&gt; and I believe what he said. But but it's not this that believes it. It's this. It's the Holy Spirit that he put down into my heart on the side of that mountain that changed the way I thought about it. I no longer fight with it. Let me put it that way. He said it. I believe it. And that's the end of it. I won't question God. I won't question the scriptures. I won't question my wedding vows that he gave to me, but I won't stop a day short. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is where the Bible says, "Help my unbelief." It It's not that we because he said, "I believe, but Lord, help Help us keep believing when we're tired. Help us keep standing when it seems like we ought to just fall. To help us keep saying the word is true when it looks like it's not because it's true. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. No matter what you see, no matter what you feel, every single promise in this love letter is a vow to you. It's an earnest. It's an inheritance of something else that's coming. We have a body that is not going to get sick. It's not going to be frail. It It's not going to be deceived. It's not going to believe the wrong things. It's not going to But he promised us we could go through this life and the signs would follow us. &gt;&gt; He gave us the promise. &gt;&gt; So, let's trust him. &gt;&gt; Let's believe him. And let's act like every single minute that that is when it happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what, we're going to have the joy of our salvation when it feels like we're lost. Have be happy when the world is falling apart. Act like we're young when we're not. Even though that hurts sometimes, but that's a lie because you know this body lies. But God don't. We're queens. And as a queen, we have everything that's his. Everything. It's our kingdom along with his. And you do not absolutely do not have to ever let Satan squat in your kingdom. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can kick him out &gt;&gt; anytime you want to. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean he's going to go easy. He's a good adversary, but he must go. &gt;&gt; Resist and the devil will flee. &gt;&gt; It didn't say when, &gt;&gt; but it said he would. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when he looked at that and he said, "Boo." It got a little smaller. He said boo again and it got a little smaller. First time he said boo, it didn't disappear. He had to keep pushing and keep resisting. &gt;&gt; And never ever lose your faith &gt;&gt; because on day 41, on day 41, the sun came out. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness on day 41, the angels ministered to him. I'm not saying it's 41 days. I'm just saying don't quit at day 40 because day 41 just might be the day. I hope that this isn't too sporadic. But if we could ever truly get the revelation that we are the queen of heaven, &gt;&gt; that's not a lie. That's not make believe. That is not fantasy. &gt;&gt; We are the queen. Man, that ought to just shove our faith right up into the heavenly places. &gt;&gt; We're the queen. &gt;&gt; We're the chosen one. &gt;&gt; We're the one that he said, "I do. I love you so much. I want to spend eternity with you." &gt;&gt; Not just a lifetime. &gt;&gt; Anybody that wants to spend an eternity with me, &gt;&gt; I'm all for that. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hold fast. Stand on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Stand on it. &gt;&gt; Stand on it. Seems like every sermon I ministered, it comes back to it. But keep standing. Keep believing because it's here. &gt;&gt; We're going home. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham said, "Watch Israel. They're our clock. We're going home." Amen. &gt;&gt; But stay in his presence. Every minute of every day, stay in his presence. And when you feel like you absolutely can't get no more, cry for more. You can never have too much of a good thing. And this brothers and sisters is the best thing. &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Brother Windle. Jesus is mine. He's been my fourth man in the fire time after time. &gt;&gt; Oh, born of his spirit. Washed in his blood. &gt;&gt; Washed in his blood. &gt;&gt; And what he did for me on Cal is more than enough. Oh, I trust in God, my savior. The one, the one who will never fail. He will never fail.

Glory to God. Glory. Hallelujah. Oh, the revelation that I am his and he is mine. The revelation. What revelation it was for Job to stand there. My redeemer lives and I will stand on that day with him. What was it? He had a revelation of that blood sacrifice and he was going through his trial. But when Jehovah came down on that whirlwind and began to talk to him and said, "I want you to stand up like a man and I want you to answer me like a man." Amen. And he and and and and God just started talking to him and said, "Where were you before the foundation of the world when the sons of God, Amen, were around the throne and and shouting for joy? Where were you, Job?" Hallelujah. And by the time it was all said and done, then he could stand up and said, "I had heard of him with mine ears, but now mine eyes have seen him." It's a divine revelation. Glory to God. The revelation that I am becoming one with him. It's an invisible union of the earthly bride and the heavenly groom. It's his word and we are accepting it into our hearts. This is real folks. We are taking God's word and we are believing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that word that you are believing is creating something within you. Hallelujah. Here before long, you can't stay in those bodies anymore. We've got to go home. Can you say amen? Amen. Did you enjoy that here tonight? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Why don't we just sing another love song to him? There is none like you. There is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity long and find there is none. All together with all of your heart now there is none no one like you my Lord. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity. Oh yeah. Oh, thank you. Thank you. There is none like you. No one else, my Lord. No one else can touch my heart. If I could search, if I could search for all eternity, oh, I'd find there is none. I love you, Lord. There is none like. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. No one else can touch my heart like you do. &gt;&gt; I could search for all eternity. I'd find. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Father, we just want to thank you tonight for your word. Thank you for your blessings. We believe every word is a blessing. Lord, the curses are for the unbelievers. The blessings are for the believers. And tonight we believe you, Lord. We thank you for your words of promise. We're thank you, Lord, for those Lord for even the the standards and the barriers that you the walls of safety, the fort, Lord, that you have fortified us behind. We thank you for your word. For Lord, we want to stay where you are. We want to stay where your word is. Lord, never let one of us walk outside of your protection. Never let one of us go beyond your word. Lord, as a wife's desire is is that of her husbands. And Lord, as the bride of Jesus Christ, we want our hearts to be pure toward you. And Lord, we love you and we trust you and we're following you and we love you with all of our heart. Lord, if there's any here that hasn't received the Holy Ghost, young or old, Lord, I pray, Lord, that you'd never let anyone in this building, don't let us even have peace in our hearts until we have received your Holy Spirit. Father, it was already given as our brother said here tonight. It's it's already there. It's a promise. Lord Jesus, whether it be here at an altar or whether it be sitting on a pew or in a prayer meeting at home, I just pray that you would fill from the youngest to the oldest. Fill us all, Lord. Make sure that we're all ready for that rapture. We love you, Lord. Oh, God. Thank you for being you. Thank you for being faithful. Thank you for healing, Lord. Thank you, Lord, every need in this building. We thank you right now for meeting every one of those needs. Thank you for it, Lord. Bless Brother John and his family, Lord. And I just pray, Lord, that you would just replenish his body here tonight, Lord, and ask that you would be with him and and bless them, Lord. Thank you for all things. We give you glory and honor in Jesus' name. God bless you tonight. Amen. Good to see everyone out. Good to see the the Curtis family and uh Fairweather family and all everyone all make it make it home and uh uh that y'all had a safe trip there and back and and so um we want to keep Brother Rory I guess those of you that has looked at the church page that's uh brother Rory Um, a Parker fell off a ladder or I guess a wind hit him and I guess they was holding a piece of plywood or something and wind hit that and knocked him down the stairs and and uh well he's in his he's in his 70s and u so he's got broken ribs and broken he's see what what else what all what all does he have broken?

They wiped him out and and so he's missing they so they they someone stole their trailers, the materials, then their house just caught on fire. They've been working on that and and then this is his dad, uh, Brother Rory." So, um I I you know, I want us to just really pray there for brother Sam and and the family when Satan's fighting. Uh we we all need to be together as a church and and just really really ask the Lord to to be with them.

But God, I just pray that you would, Lord, that this same God that we feel in this service would just settle down right now, Lord, there in Witchah. And I pray, Father, oh God, we thank you for it. There's no plans that Satan has that can come to fruion. For Lord, you are the author of our life and you're the author of our tomorrow. We thank you for it, Father.
