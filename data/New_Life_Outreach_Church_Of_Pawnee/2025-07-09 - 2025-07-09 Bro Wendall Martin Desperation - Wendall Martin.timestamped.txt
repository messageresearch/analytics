[35:02] unto you. You shall seek me and find me.
[35:05] And when ye shall search for me with all
[35:09] of your heart, I will be found of you,
[35:12] saith the Lord. I will turn away your
[35:14] captivity, and will gather you from all
[35:17] the nations, and from all the places
[35:19] whether I've driven you, saith the Lord,
[35:22] and I will bring you again into the
[35:25] place whence I have caused you to be
[35:28] carried away captive. Amen. Let's go to
[35:31] the Lord in prayer.

[36:29] they are. Lord, bring them near and
[36:31] we'll give you glory and honor in the
[36:34] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the
[36:37] church say amen?
[36:39] And amen. God bless you. You may be
[36:41] seated tonight. I'd like to say it's
[36:44] also good to see uh Sister Denise. We
[36:48] missed her. Been missing her a lot, her
[36:52] and brother Mike. And um glad she's uh
[36:56] off of bed rest and and um um we're
[37:01] brother um brother Torren, he's a
[37:04] grandpa again. Amen.
[37:08] And uh so we're sure proud for him and
[37:10] and that that baby uh girl and u so
[37:16] we're sure thankful that the Lord helped
[37:18] her with the delivery and and everything
[37:20] is turned out all right. and they act
[37:22] like maybe amen if if the baby does okay
[37:25] that she might get to go home this
[37:27] weekend. So So we're just really excited
[37:30] for that. I I want to as I looked here
[37:34] at this scripture, Amen. um the promise
[37:38] that there would be 70 years of Babylon
[37:43] and that there would um that the people
[37:48] would go into captivity
[37:50] and um but the scripture says that God
[37:53] would would bring them back uh to their
[37:57] land of promise and um after that time
[38:01] was accomplished there would be uh an
[38:04] exodus there would be a coming out And
[38:06] God would God would bring them and and
[38:10] bring them near to him
[38:13] and that he would reveal himself.
[38:18] Amen. That his uh thoughts were going to
[38:22] change toward them and would would bring
[38:26] them back to the land of promise that
[38:29] that he had originally given them. And
[38:33] he said, "I will gather you. I I'm going
[38:35] to bring you back. I'm going to bring
[38:37] you back to this place that that I had
[38:40] ordained for you tonight. I want to I
[38:45] want to us to look at this scripture as
[38:49] the Exodus as we are fixing to go home.
[38:52] We are we know that the scripture has
[38:55] said that amen that there was going to
[38:58] come a time an ending of time where we
[39:02] would go back to our land of promise go
[39:05] back to the word go back to amen our
[39:09] authority go back to h an earth that
[39:14] will not have sin upon it and brother
[39:17] Brandham used this scripture as he
[39:20] preached the message of desper
[39:22] desperations and and he he brought this
[39:26] in that as the time was to come, it
[39:29] would produce a desperation
[39:32] uh uh in the hearts of the people to see
[39:36] God's word be fulfilled. Amen. That as
[39:40] the time come and we understand that,
[39:43] Amen. as the the scripture uh declares
[39:46] that Daniel as he as he come uh you know
[39:50] wrote in his books that as the time
[39:53] begin to draw near as Amen. Then he
[39:58] begin to uh look into the books and and
[40:01] the then the people begin to anticipate
[40:05] and they begin to groan and cry and call
[40:08] out to God to begin to feel his word
[40:12] because his word must come to pass. God
[40:16] gives a promise. God cannot lie.
[40:20] He just cannot lie. Amen. And so I I I
[40:24] want us to to to deal with this here
[40:27] tonight because I believe that if
[40:29] there's ever a time for desperation, I
[40:31] believe that time is now. Amen.
[40:34] Believing God to fulfill his word in in
[40:37] our lives. How many believes that there
[40:39] are scriptures that must be fulfilled
[40:42] yet today? There are scriptures that
[40:44] must be fulfilled. We we we there are
[40:47] scriptures that were for Noah that does
[40:49] not attain unto day. There were
[40:51] scriptures for Moses that does not uh
[40:53] pertain unto today. But there are
[40:55] rapturing scriptures that must be
[40:58] fulfilled today. Amen. And I believe
[41:01] that that as as the Exodus coming out of
[41:05] Egypt when God had sent Moses, Amen. God
[41:09] gave them a gave gave them a a lamb. It
[41:14] was the Passover. and and they had to
[41:18] take that lamb and they had to slay that
[41:21] lamb and they had to apply the blood
[41:24] upon the doorpost. They had to uh uh uh
[41:28] uh roast the lamb. There were there were
[41:31] certain requirements that they had to do
[41:35] as they were preparing to leave because
[41:38] they were going to leave at midnight.
[41:41] Amen. the death angel was going to
[41:43] strike. And it was so important that
[41:46] they had the blood of plaid. It was so
[41:48] important that they had the lamb roasted
[41:52] and that they were eating it with the
[41:53] bitter herbs and and and the scripture
[41:56] says, "Amen, that they were to eat it
[41:59] with their uh uh their shoes on their
[42:02] feet and their garments on and their
[42:05] staff in their hands." They were to eat
[42:07] it with anticipation
[42:10] of leaving very quickly. Amen. They were
[42:14] to apply the blood. They were to roast
[42:16] and eat the lamb. And they were to do
[42:19] all of this with the staff in their
[42:22] hand. And they had to be prepared. Amen.
[42:25] To go. And so, Amen. I I I I believe
[42:28] that there was a a an anticipation in
[42:32] their heart. There was a desperation
[42:35] because there was also the death angel
[42:37] that was going to pass and those without
[42:40] the blood were going to die. Amen. All
[42:43] of the firstborn were going to die.
[42:45] Those who did not have the blood of that
[42:49] lamb over their dwelling. I I want to
[42:52] tell you today, Amen. There should be a
[42:55] desperation uh in the church of the
[42:58] living God. There should be a
[42:59] desperation for the living God because
[43:02] I'm here to tell you we're in an exodus.
[43:05] Amen. That we are preparing to go home.
[43:08] We We are so close to making Amen. for
[43:12] that body change and for that rapture.
[43:15] And if there's ever been a time for us
[43:17] to have the blood applied, and if
[43:19] there's ever been a time for us to eat
[43:22] that lamb, if there's ever been a time
[43:24] for us to be desperate, it should be
[43:27] today. Amen. The plagues of judgment are
[43:30] all around us. Men's hearts have it's
[43:33] already been prophesied that men's
[43:34] hearts will fail for the fearful things
[43:37] that are coming upon the earth. Amen.
[43:40] And and there's going to be the utter
[43:42] chaos and the antichrist is his spirit
[43:45] is supposed to be upon the earth and the
[43:48] anti-word. Friends, I want to tell you
[43:50] the promises are are are real and those
[43:53] promises are coming to pass. Amen. It's
[43:56] coming to pass. But it's in the time of
[43:59] crisis, amen, that brings the depths of
[44:02] of who we really are. It's in those
[44:05] times when we begin to feel the pressure
[44:08] and we begin to see the word of God
[44:11] coming to pass. Amen. It shows who we
[44:14] really are on the inside. Amen. I I
[44:17] believe that those slaves in that on
[44:19] that Exodus, he Amen. there it be to
[44:22] show that they were the seed of Abraham.
[44:25] They were going to heed to the word of
[44:27] God. They were going to Amen. slay that
[44:30] lamb and they were going to be ready to
[44:33] go. I I I want to be ready to go. How
[44:35] about you?
[44:37] Amen. It'll bring the crisis will bring
[44:40] the real you out. Amen. Do you really
[44:43] want victory? Do you do you really need
[44:47] help? Do you Amen. Do you really uh h
[44:50] want to overcome? These are things that
[44:53] begins to come as we begin to look at
[44:55] the clock as it's beginning to to tick
[44:58] closer and closer to the coming of the
[45:00] Lord. Amen. And it begins to to to
[45:03] really produce a desperation, something
[45:06] within my heart. I don't want to play
[45:08] around with God. I I don't want to just
[45:11] h play church, but I want the blood of
[45:14] the lamb to be applied. And I want to
[45:17] make sure that when the death angel is
[45:19] striking that I am ready for the coming
[45:22] of the Lord. Amen. Uh that brother
[45:25] Brandham would say he says now Amen. As
[45:28] we talk on desperations for a few
[45:30] minutes he says it's usually in that
[45:32] state of emergency that throws us into
[45:34] desperation. He says it's too bad it has
[45:38] to do that. But human beings are so
[45:40] slothful in their mind that it takes an
[45:42] emergency. something arises and when
[45:45] they do, Amen. when it does, it throws
[45:48] them into desperation. And really, in
[45:51] doing that, in desperation, it brings
[45:54] the real thing that you are. It shows
[45:57] what you're made of in the real in the
[45:59] time of desperation. And it really pulls
[46:03] all the good things that's in you. How
[46:06] many wants to say, "Lord, pull the good
[46:09] things that's in me." Amen. That's
[46:11] right. Now remember that in that Exodus
[46:14] he says tonight. Amen. He says we're
[46:16] taking the symbols of the Passover.
[46:19] Amen. He says the Passover was taken in
[46:21] an emergency in the time of desperation.
[46:24] He says Exodus 12. Amen. The 11th verse
[46:27] it says. Amen. To eat this Passover with
[46:30] the shoes on your feet and the loins
[46:34] girded up with the staff in your hand.
[46:37] You're eating it in desperation. He said
[46:40] they had seen the great hand of God.
[46:42] They had all saw his miracles and the
[46:45] signs of the token. Amen. And then they
[46:47] had to come under the sign of the token.
[46:50] And while they were under the sign of
[46:52] the token, they've taken the communion
[46:55] in desperation. They knew that it was
[46:58] time God was fixing to strike with
[47:01] judgment. It was a shaking time. It was
[47:04] a time where every man was examining
[47:07] himself because the word of the prophet
[47:10] had not failed one time. It had been
[47:13] proven to be true and whatever he said
[47:15] had happened just exactly the way he
[47:18] said it. And the pillar of fire was
[47:20] still there. Amen. And the prophet had
[47:22] announced that God would only pass over
[47:25] when he saw the token at the door. It
[47:28] was a time of desperation. A Can you say
[47:31] amen? He says, "I would imagine that the
[47:33] children were a man as they were looking
[47:36] out and seeing those big black wings
[47:38] drop down from the sky like a like a
[47:41] smoke settling over the city and the
[47:43] screams coming from every house." And
[47:45] the children went to their daddy and
[47:47] said, "Daddy, are you sure that we're
[47:49] under the token?" And he could go to the
[47:51] door and look upon the post and the ll
[47:54] and say, "Son, that is according to his
[47:57] word. Remember, you're my oldest child.
[48:01] Daddy, are you positive? Amen. Are are
[48:04] you positive? I'm your oldest child. And
[48:06] daddy would say, I am positive. That's
[48:10] according to what the prophet told us.
[48:12] And he has the word of the Lord. I I I I
[48:16] want to say tonight, Amen. as we are
[48:18] looking and seeing this this time of of
[48:21] Exodus that is upon us. Amen. It's so
[48:24] good to be able to look at the word and
[48:26] say, "God, I've applied that word to my
[48:29] heart.
[48:30] Amen. Now's not the time to be playing
[48:33] around. Now's Now's not the time for
[48:35] Amen. you you young men, young girls
[48:38] being out going out and enjoying
[48:40] yourself. And Amen. Listen, if you get
[48:43] outside the token, Amen. the death angel
[48:47] shall surely strike. This is not the
[48:50] time for us to Amen. to lolly go around.
[48:53] This is the time to say, "God, Amen. I
[48:57] want to know that I know that I know."
[49:00] We know that the token, Amen, that was
[49:03] the literal blood. But today, the token
[49:05] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[49:08] brother, if you have not had the baptism
[49:11] of the Holy Ghost upon your life, I say
[49:14] today, it's time to get desperate and
[49:17] know that you've got that token and that
[49:20] you are under that token. Can you say
[49:23] amen? Amen. I want to be positive. Amen.
[49:26] That I want to be positive. When I see
[49:29] the blood, I'll pass over you. Amen.
[49:32] Take a lamb for the house. I've brought
[49:35] you children in. You're my oldest.
[49:37] You're my firstborn. Amen. That's the
[49:39] one that's dying in all of the houses
[49:41] out there. But there is the blood.
[49:44] That's what thus saith the Lord was. So
[49:48] rest my son, rest at ease because God
[49:53] made the promise. Oh, glory be to God.
[49:58] Amen. The Holy Ghost, that token will
[50:01] last. It'll stand the test of time. Can
[50:04] you say amen? Amen. Brother, if there's
[50:07] ever a time, amen, for desperation, I
[50:09] believe this is the hour. If there's
[50:11] ever a time to amen say, "God, you've
[50:14] given a promise." And I want to make
[50:16] sure I want to see the promises of God,
[50:19] not just of destruction, but I want to
[50:21] see the positive promises of God coming
[50:23] to pass. I know that, amen, the pope was
[50:26] elected out from the United States was
[50:29] elected. And I'm thankful that prophecy
[50:31] come to pass. I'm thankful to see, Amen,
[50:34] these things all coming to pass as the
[50:37] word of God said. But there are some
[50:39] positive promises that have been given
[50:42] to you as well. And there must be a
[50:45] desperation.
[50:47] Amen. A desperation for God's word to
[50:50] come to pass. Can you say amen? Amen.
[50:53] The boy would say, "Well, daddy, amen.
[50:55] Why? Why you got your shoes on? Why? Why
[50:57] you got your staff in your hand? Amen.
[51:00] Why? Why have you got a piece of bread
[51:02] in one hand and a lamb in the other? Why
[51:05] is them bitter herbs and things?" Amen.
[51:08] Amen. Why is the is the sweat running
[51:11] off your face about son? Death is fixing
[51:14] to strike. It is a time of desperation.
[51:20] Amen.
[51:21] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. Now, he
[51:24] was under the blood, but the sweat was
[51:26] still a dripping. Amen. Because it was
[51:29] an hour. It was an hour. Things were
[51:31] fixing to happen. Things were fixing to
[51:33] come. Amen. And he knew that he had to
[51:36] be ready, amen, to leave whenever the
[51:39] prophet of God bid him to go. Can you
[51:42] say amen? Amen. I believe we're living
[51:44] in the last days. Amen. Otherwise, the
[51:47] days were should should cause the church
[51:50] to go completely into desperation. Do
[51:53] you believe that here today? Amen. I
[51:55] believe he says since the message this
[51:58] morning from God, not me. Amen. on the
[52:00] token. I believe it ought to throw this
[52:03] entire congregation into desperation
[52:07] that we have played long enough and
[52:09] we've went to church long enough. We've
[52:12] got to do something. Amen. How are we
[52:15] going to see these great signs and
[52:17] wonders done? Amen. What about us? It
[52:21] should cause in a state of desperation
[52:24] that we are determined before God. the
[52:27] signs of his coming would bring this
[52:30] entire congregation when we've read it
[52:32] from the word. Can I hear an amen? Amen.
[52:36] Oh yes. Amen. Where the word is
[52:38] beginning to take on flesh. Amen. Where
[52:40] the word Amen is coming off the pages.
[52:43] Oh, I love it. Amen. You see, there was
[52:46] prophecy after prophecy that was going
[52:49] on about Jesus coming. And then from
[52:51] Malachi to Matthew, there was a 400year
[52:54] uh interval where there were no
[52:56] prophets. There were no Amen. There
[52:58] there was nothing happening. Amen. But
[53:01] one day a prophet appeared and says,
[53:04] "You've got to get ready because I am
[53:07] the voice of one crying in the
[53:09] wilderness saying the promised word that
[53:12] we have been looking for is on the earth
[53:15] now." Amen. John says, "Listen, folks,
[53:20] wake up." Amen. Arouse yourself. Get
[53:23] your senses in order. Amen. The promised
[53:27] word that God said would come, the
[53:30] Messiah is on the earth now.
[53:35] Amen. It was a time of desperation. Can
[53:38] you say amen? Amen. Yes. You see, that's
[53:42] what that's what it should do. It should
[53:45] throw us this morning or this evening
[53:47] into that desperation. Hallelujah. Amen.
[53:50] Oh my. When we see the skies, the
[53:53] prophecy given, Brother Brandham would
[53:55] use this in this desperation and the
[53:57] token, he puts them both together and
[53:59] parallels them. Amen. As he's saying
[54:02] now, as God has as God sent us there,
[54:04] Arizona and he opened the seals. Amen.
[54:07] He says this is the equivalent of what
[54:10] God was doing in that Exodus. Amen. It
[54:13] should cause us. It's an awakening to
[54:16] us. to something that says, "Oh, God,
[54:20] you're fixing to do something."
[54:25] Now,
[54:27] he says, "Now, the Holy Spirit has told
[54:29] us to go at a certain place such and
[54:30] such will happen." Amen. Not tell us
[54:34] what it was, but but what would happen.
[54:37] Amen. There we go. And it and it happens
[54:39] that way. The newspapers packed it. The
[54:42] magazines packed it. Showed the picture
[54:44] of it and come back here and see those
[54:46] mysteries hidden in the Bible and opened
[54:47] up to us on a on a new field that we
[54:50] never knowed before. Perfectly blends to
[54:53] the coming of the Lord. Amen. Then at
[54:56] the end of the messages, see the action
[54:58] of the great Holy Spirit. See him coming
[55:00] down visible before the people. Even
[55:02] taking pictures of it and see it working
[55:04] and showing that it's not a man. It's
[55:07] not just a preacher. It's not a certain
[55:09] congregation. that it's the Holy Spirit
[55:11] showing the same thing that it did when
[55:13] it embodied in the body of Jesus Christ.
[55:16] He says, "Now it's embodied in the body
[55:20] of the bride. It should throw us into
[55:24] desperation."
[55:25] Amen. The scriptures that were promised
[55:28] of that one to come, there was another
[55:30] one who has come in this day that was
[55:33] screaming out, "The word is on the earth
[55:37] again." if you can understand it.
[55:41] Amen. That now as Jesus the groom was in
[55:45] a body. Hallelujah. Amen. Now it's
[55:50] embodied in the body of the bride. Just
[55:53] think of that. Now Jesus was there as
[55:55] the word made flesh. He was the first of
[55:58] all of the Old Testaments, all of the
[56:00] prophecies, everything. He was the
[56:03] person of all of those prophecies. Jesus
[56:06] was the lamb of God. Jesus was the
[56:10] altar. Jesus was all of those Old
[56:13] Testament prophecies was all in the body
[56:16] of Jesus Christ. He was the perfect
[56:19] word. And it required desperation in
[56:23] that hour for the people to see what God
[56:26] was doing because truly it was the
[56:29] greatest hour the world had ever known.
[56:33] Well, can you say amen? But I say today,
[56:37] amen, there's been another voice that's
[56:38] crying out in this hour. It's the It's
[56:41] the midnight cry. It's that cry that is
[56:44] saying, "Amen, there is something else
[56:47] happening. The word is being fulfilled.
[56:50] The bride has come to her completion.
[56:53] God is come in a body, the bride of
[56:57] Jesus Christ."
[57:00] Well, praise the Lord. Now, amen. There
[57:04] was a question that was asked in the
[57:06] opening of the seals. Is the bride of
[57:08] Christ and the body of Christ the same?
[57:11] Yes, sir. When God gave Adam his bride
[57:14] from his side, he said, "She is flesh of
[57:16] my flesh and bone of my bone." Is that
[57:18] right? When God gave Christ his bride,
[57:21] the spirit gave the flesh the bride. He
[57:24] was he was pierced in his side under his
[57:27] heart and water and blood and spirit
[57:29] came forth and that become flesh of his
[57:32] flesh, bone of his bone. We are the
[57:36] flesh and bones. The bride will be the
[57:40] flesh and bones of Jesus Christ. Well,
[57:43] praise the Lord. Can you say amen? Amen.
[57:46] Oh, what desperation. He says the church
[57:48] will go through justification through
[57:51] Luther and sanctification through Wesley
[57:53] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[57:55] Pentecostals, and go right on into the
[57:58] perfection of the Son of Man when the
[58:01] husband and the bride will be the same
[58:04] thing. And God will be so manifested
[58:09] into his bride, his church, till they
[58:12] will be the same thing. There is a
[58:15] desperation saying, "God, you've got a
[58:19] promise for me in this day." Oh, come
[58:22] on, church. Amen. There is a people
[58:25] that'll heed to nothing but his word.
[58:27] There is a people whose desire, whose
[58:30] anger, whose whose whose emotions,
[58:34] everything about them is, God, let your
[58:38] word come to pass in me, in my body.
[58:43] A cry, a cry, a desperation
[58:47] for his word to come to pass
[58:51] in me. Can you say amen? The ministry of
[58:55] the bride, he says it has to be so
[58:58] because a woman and her husband have
[58:59] become one. They become one and so does
[59:01] the bride and Christ become one. The
[59:04] ministry of the bride and the ministry
[59:06] of Christ is the same. Remember the
[59:08] former treaties. Oh, O Theophilles, I
[59:11] have wrote to you that Jesus began to do
[59:14] and continues to do. His death did not
[59:18] stop him. No sir, he returned again. Not
[59:21] a third person, but the same person
[59:23] returned in the form of the Holy Ghost
[59:26] to continue the work on. And he
[59:29] continues on, says the book of Acts.
[59:32] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[59:36] and forever. That's the token. That's
[59:40] the sign.
[59:46] Can you say amen? How does the bride
[59:49] minister?
[59:50] Amen. Now, I know I know we're living in
[59:54] a in in a day where Amen. where it's all
[59:58] co-equal and you know men and women are
[1:00:01] the same and Amen. But but how many
[1:00:04] knows that Hallelujah the Apostle Paul
[1:00:07] says that you women came from the man?
[1:00:11] The man wasn't created for the woman.
[1:00:13] The woman was created for the man.
[1:00:20] Hallelujah. Amen. So the man was not
[1:00:23] created to to meet your whim. The woman
[1:00:25] was created to meet his whim. Amen. You
[1:00:29] say, "No, no, no, brother. I just
[1:00:31] can't." The Bible says that he created a
[1:00:33] help meat. Those are not even two words.
[1:00:36] He they did not put help me together.
[1:00:38] Amen. It was a help meet. Two separate
[1:00:41] words in the in the King James version.
[1:00:43] Amen. In other words, a helper that is
[1:00:46] suitable to meet his needs. A helper
[1:00:50] that is well, praise the name of the
[1:00:52] Lord. If we are the bride of Jesus
[1:00:55] Christ, Amen. Our desire is to fulfill
[1:01:00] his desires.
[1:01:04] Are y'all awake out there? Hallelujah.
[1:01:06] Amen. Our desire, Amen. our creation in
[1:01:11] the first place, our very nature as the
[1:01:14] bride of Christ. It is our nature to
[1:01:17] serve him, to love him, to be a suitable
[1:01:22] helper. Oh, glory be to the lamb of God.
[1:01:24] Amen. Well, brother Window, what am I
[1:01:27] going to do? Amen. What am I going to
[1:01:29] do? Well, I want to tell you, you are
[1:01:31] his earthly body. You are his earthly
[1:01:34] body. What he done on earth, he's
[1:01:36] wanting you to do on earth. Amen. What
[1:01:38] can you say? Amen. He cast out devils.
[1:01:41] He raised the dead. Amen. He ministered
[1:01:44] at his word to the sick. God's got a
[1:01:47] body here on this earth that has one
[1:01:50] desire, and that that is his way. live
[1:01:54] and reign and move in this bride.
[1:02:00] Can you say amen? He says, "Who is your
[1:02:03] little queen in the home? She ministers
[1:02:05] food to you." Is that right? Now, what
[1:02:08] what what your uh He says, "You she she
[1:02:12] ministers to you." The The bride
[1:02:15] ministers
[1:02:16] to Christ the word. The bride is
[1:02:21] ministering the word back to Christ.
[1:02:25] Now, now listen to this. Man should not
[1:02:27] live by bread alone, but by every word.
[1:02:29] She ministers the word to the king,
[1:02:34] manifesting his promised word in the age
[1:02:38] that she's living in. How am I
[1:02:42] ministering the word back to Christ? by
[1:02:45] ministering by manifesting his word in
[1:02:49] the well praise the name of the Lord.
[1:02:52] It's his desires that it's his it's his
[1:02:55] makeup. It's his desires that I want to
[1:02:58] reflect. It's his word that I want to
[1:03:01] come to pass on the earth. His desire
[1:03:04] what he desires is my desire here on
[1:03:08] this earth. If God is wanting devils to
[1:03:12] be cast out, if God is wanting his word
[1:03:15] to be living, then it is my
[1:03:18] responsibility
[1:03:20] to manifest that word in this hour.
[1:03:27] Well, now, Brother Wendell, that's hard.
[1:03:30] That's why it should bring us to
[1:03:33] desperation.
[1:03:37] You see, we should not take this
[1:03:39] marriage lightly.
[1:03:43] Marriage is not for a kid.
[1:03:48] Companionship. That's the reason why you
[1:03:51] 14, 15 year olds shouldn't even worry
[1:03:54] about boyfriends and girlfriends.
[1:03:56] You ain't got no business there. You
[1:03:58] can't get married anyways. And besides,
[1:04:00] you might like him today, you'll like
[1:04:02] someone else tomorrow. And that's right.
[1:04:04] You got to grow up. You got to mature.
[1:04:07] You got to You got to know what you're
[1:04:09] doing. Well, praise the Lord. It's sad
[1:04:11] when there's adults that are still kids.
[1:04:15] Amen. But God ain't God ain't calling.
[1:04:18] Amen. God, you you if you're going to
[1:04:21] marry a man, Amen, young lady, you're
[1:04:24] going to have to be you're going to have
[1:04:25] to be mature. You're going to have to be
[1:04:27] grown up about it. Amen. They they're
[1:04:30] not acting like one of those kids th
[1:04:32] those little kids fighting in the out
[1:04:34] out there in the in in in the schoolyard
[1:04:36] all the time. Amen. But you've got to
[1:04:38] you got to come to the table with
[1:04:40] maturity.
[1:04:43] I know what I'm getting into.
[1:04:45] This is my man
[1:04:48] and I'm going to give him my life.
[1:04:52] And you better you better you better
[1:04:54] marry a guy that's matured
[1:04:57] because he's going to say because you're
[1:04:59] fixing to tell him that I am going to
[1:05:03] give everything that I am to you. You
[1:05:06] are now my responsibility.
[1:05:10] You are well. Praise the Lord. I don't
[1:05:12] know. I don't know why the feminists
[1:05:14] want wanted it equal. Anyways, let your
[1:05:16] man get out there and fight your battles
[1:05:18] for you.
[1:05:20] Okay. Well, can I hear an amen?
[1:05:23] Amen. Let your let your man get out
[1:05:25] there, you know, and and and and let him
[1:05:29] But but you better you better you better
[1:05:30] know that you know that you know that
[1:05:31] he's a he's the right kind of guy
[1:05:34] because marriage is forever.
[1:05:37] Well, hallelujah. How did I get off on
[1:05:39] that? Oh, yeah. Ministering the word
[1:05:42] back to your queen. Now, I want you to
[1:05:44] take this quote. I want you to listen.
[1:05:46] Listen, this is the reason I'm saying
[1:05:48] that we're not desperate about this is
[1:05:50] because could it be that we're still a
[1:05:52] little girl?
[1:05:55] Could it be that the bride is not mature
[1:05:57] enough to take the word of God and take
[1:06:00] the responsibility of marriage? Amen.
[1:06:02] This is the age of marriage. Listen,
[1:06:04] this is the invisible union of the bride
[1:06:06] of Christ to the heavenly groom.
[1:06:09] There is a responsibility that comes.
[1:06:12] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. I wish there were
[1:06:14] other people. Amen. I I I I I I I I want
[1:06:17] to tell you I'm not worried about other
[1:06:19] people. I know that I have a
[1:06:22] responsibility.
[1:06:29] Marriage is not for the faint-hearted.
[1:06:34] Marriage is not for the weak.
[1:06:37] Marriage
[1:06:42] is for a man and a woman
[1:06:48] who have found love and companionship in
[1:06:51] one another.
[1:06:53] Can you say amen?
[1:06:55] They can change the world together. That
[1:06:57] man without her was only half a man.
[1:07:01] That woman without him, she was only
[1:07:04] half a woman. But when you bring them
[1:07:06] together, they become an unstoppable
[1:07:09] force. Hallelujah.
[1:07:12] I said hallelujah. Did you know that
[1:07:15] Jesus without you is not fulfilled?
[1:07:20] That's what your prophet said. Your
[1:07:22] prophet said that he is unfulfilled
[1:07:24] without you. He would have no purpose.
[1:07:27] You are his purpose just as you are
[1:07:30] unfulfilled without Christ. But when
[1:07:33] Christ comes and unites with his, amen,
[1:07:36] his earthly bride uh bride. Amen. There
[1:07:40] is a union that takes place. He is
[1:07:43] fulfilled. She is fulfilled. There is a
[1:07:46] union.
[1:07:48] Oh, glory to God. Amen. I I I that that
[1:07:53] song that that brother Kobe brought up.
[1:07:54] Amen. I I I
[1:07:57] whatever I'm
[1:08:00] lost without you. I'm desperate for you.
[1:08:04] I need you. However that song goes.
[1:08:07] Amen. You see? Amen. It is her. Now, I'm
[1:08:09] going to read this to you again. The
[1:08:11] bride ministers to Christ the word. Man
[1:08:16] shall not live by bread alone, but by
[1:08:17] every word. She ministers the word to
[1:08:21] the king, manifesting his promised word
[1:08:26] in the age that she's living. Amen. Oh,
[1:08:30] I said something then, but you didn't
[1:08:32] get it. Notice how it's a good one.
[1:08:35] Ministering
[1:08:37] in this age the word.
[1:08:44] Do you see the hour?
[1:08:46] Do you see the responsibility?
[1:08:50] Amen. Invisible union of the bride. He
[1:08:53] says, "But through our creed, we have
[1:08:56] disassociated the fellowship of the Holy
[1:08:58] Spirit to anoint the word of God that is
[1:09:00] laced out for this generation
[1:09:04] because we have accepted creed around
[1:09:07] truth.
[1:09:10] But we have failed to realize
[1:09:13] that I as a bride of Jesus Christ have a
[1:09:18] great honor
[1:09:20] and that's for his word to be kept.
[1:09:24] It should be an honor
[1:09:27] when someone asks for healing.
[1:09:30] It should be an honor for us to stand
[1:09:32] there and say,
[1:09:35] "Christ, the word, my groom, died and
[1:09:38] paid the price at Calvary for your
[1:09:41] healing."
[1:09:43] It should be the bride's cry
[1:09:46] for God's word to be fulfilled
[1:09:50] in our day.
[1:09:55] spirits of unbelief that comes in and
[1:09:57] tries to take away healing, tries to h
[1:10:00] that is ruining the marriages and
[1:10:02] children. It should be our
[1:10:06] our duty
[1:10:08] take up for our man
[1:10:11] and say our man paid the price.
[1:10:17] He paid for redemption. He paid for
[1:10:20] healing. He paid for restored marriages.
[1:10:23] He paid Amen. He paid the price. Can you
[1:10:26] say amen? He says, "But our creeds, the
[1:10:29] creeds have disassociated the fellowship
[1:10:32] of the Holy Spirit to anoint the word
[1:10:34] that is here that's been laced out
[1:10:36] through this generation." Can you say
[1:10:39] amen? You see, I think this is a an
[1:10:41] incredible responsibility because it's
[1:10:44] an incredible thing because those of us
[1:10:46] who are members of this bride, we have
[1:10:50] that cry within us for the Lord to keep
[1:10:54] his word. And it's not something that
[1:10:56] we're begging. We know who he is. And we
[1:10:59] know that spirit of the Antichrist is
[1:11:01] doing everything he can to to to push
[1:11:04] the word down and the effects of the
[1:11:06] word down. The bride's desire is that
[1:11:10] God's word be unlimited.
[1:11:14] Unlimited within every one of us.
[1:11:16] Unlimited. Well, can you say amen?
[1:11:19] Amen. So, we got to shake ourselves.
[1:11:22] Amen. Because your lover
[1:11:25] desires to be ministered. And what does
[1:11:29] he want? He wants his word ministered
[1:11:33] back to him by its fulfillment.
[1:11:38] Now he says, "What about the church?
[1:11:40] What kind of a messiah is the church
[1:11:41] looking for today? You the church cried
[1:11:44] the loudest." So, so what are we
[1:11:45] hollering about a messiah? What are we
[1:11:47] hollering? Revival in our time back
[1:11:49] this, that, and the other. Amen. What
[1:11:51] are they looking for to do it? What more
[1:11:54] do you want? What does the church want
[1:11:56] anyhow? You've already got it. God gave
[1:11:59] it to us. It's his promise for this
[1:12:02] hour.
[1:12:04] We look in the Bible and we see it
[1:12:05] everywhere throughout the Bible.
[1:12:07] Anointed ones come on and made the word
[1:12:09] live again right in the hour for that
[1:12:11] hour. And we've got the Messiah. This is
[1:12:16] him. The word in the beginning was the
[1:12:18] word. The word was with God. The word
[1:12:20] was God. The word remains God. Hebrews
[1:12:24] 13:8. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:26] forever. We know what is supposed to
[1:12:29] take place in this day. We're wanting a
[1:12:32] Messiah. And God has gave us a Messiah,
[1:12:35] his promised word for the day. It's just
[1:12:38] waiting for somebody with faith to
[1:12:42] anoint it and make it live again. Yes,
[1:12:45] sir. It's a real Messiah.
[1:12:51] Oh, glory. Just waiting. He's done
[1:12:53] giving it to us. He's waiting for the
[1:12:55] bride to pick it up and to make it live.
[1:12:58] He's already given us that word. He's
[1:13:01] Well, come on. He's waiting for amen. A
[1:13:03] crowd to grow up in maturity of faith
[1:13:06] and say I believe nothing but the word.
[1:13:08] My cry, my heart, my need is for the
[1:13:12] word to be fulfilled in this day.
[1:13:17] Got to cry. I want the supernatural in
[1:13:20] my family. I want the supern well.
[1:13:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:23] I want supernatural. Amen. With my wife.
[1:13:26] I want supernatural with my children, my
[1:13:29] grandchildren. I want the supernatural.
[1:13:32] Amen. Hearing our songs. I want this.
[1:13:34] Well, praise the Lord. You know why?
[1:13:36] Because that's when Christ receives
[1:13:39] honor and glory. When we minister his
[1:13:43] word back to him,
[1:13:46] anointing it
[1:13:49] with our faith.
[1:13:53] He gave the word. And now bone of his
[1:13:56] bone, flesh of his flesh. We're
[1:13:59] believing that word and we're saying, "I
[1:14:02] believe what you say in Jesus name."
[1:14:07] Amen. Now, it's just waiting for
[1:14:10] somebody to anoint it. He says, "Yes,
[1:14:12] sir. It's the word of God. Both heavens
[1:14:15] and earth will pass away, but my word
[1:14:17] shall live forever." But yet, the church
[1:14:20] set spiritually dead, gone. The hours
[1:14:24] pass them. They're in a slump and hardly
[1:14:26] know what to do. one running this way
[1:14:28] and one that way. And here, every
[1:14:31] promise that God made in the Bible,
[1:14:35] every one of them is laying there just
[1:14:38] as good as they ever was. It's the hour,
[1:14:48] desperation.
[1:14:51] Am I making sense here tonight?
[1:14:54] The token, now this is all coming to
[1:14:56] pass. The token was for them to go to a
[1:14:57] natural land, to go back to their
[1:15:00] natural land. But the promise for you
[1:15:03] and I is to go to our
[1:15:06] place of authority.
[1:15:12] Oh, glory to God. Someone told me one
[1:15:15] time, "You put too much on the bride.
[1:15:18] Everything I hear you preach is always
[1:15:20] bride, bride, bride, bride, bride,
[1:15:21] bride, bride. Nothing about Jesus.
[1:15:23] Bride, bride, bride.
[1:15:26] Well, I
[1:15:28] don't know.
[1:15:31] So when brother Brandham talks about you
[1:15:32] look from the book of revel or book
[1:15:34] Genesis all the way to the bre of
[1:15:36] revelations and all you hear all you see
[1:15:38] is nothing but Christ.
[1:15:41] He says and if you don't see Christ go
[1:15:44] back and read it again.
[1:15:47] And then he says, "If you don't see
[1:15:48] yourself,
[1:15:52] you need a fresh revelation."
[1:15:57] The reason for Christ
[1:16:00] is you.
[1:16:04] Christ
[1:16:06] has one purpose. He left the throne to
[1:16:09] bring you back to him
[1:16:12] because you had fallen. And he's come to
[1:16:15] redeem you.
[1:16:17] So, how are we going to minister Christ?
[1:16:20] Make his word for this day live.
[1:16:29] I sort of I sort of have praise the
[1:16:32] Lord. Well, this is this I don't know
[1:16:33] maybe I'm meddling a little bit or or
[1:16:35] just talking when this is just me. This
[1:16:38] ain't scripture. This is just me.
[1:16:42] But but I I I I sort of think that
[1:16:51] asking God all the time,
[1:16:54] having everyone pray for us all the
[1:16:56] time,
[1:16:58] having everyone brings you pray for me.
[1:17:00] Would you pray for me? Would you pray
[1:17:01] for me? I don't know if that's what God
[1:17:03] is wanting for this day.
[1:17:08] Now the reason I've come up with this is
[1:17:11] because you remember it was it was the
[1:17:16] it it was Jarus that wanted Jesus to
[1:17:19] come and lay hands upon the girl.
[1:17:26] He was a Jew.
[1:17:28] But it was it was the centurion, the
[1:17:32] gentile
[1:17:34] that says, "You don't even have to come
[1:17:36] to my house. Just speak the word and my
[1:17:41] servant will live."
[1:17:45] I like prayer lines. I like I I I I
[1:17:48] believe in praying for the sick. I
[1:17:50] believe in anointing them.
[1:17:53] But we don't see a lot of results is
[1:17:55] because the gentile faith within the
[1:17:59] elect to stand up and claim our
[1:18:02] mountains.
[1:18:04] We're not desperate enough.
[1:18:07] We're not desperate enough. We we we we
[1:18:10] we say, "Well, whether it happens or
[1:18:12] whether it doesn't, it's one way or the
[1:18:14] other." There's going to be somebody
[1:18:15] that says, "I want God to receive glory
[1:18:20] from this infirmity.
[1:18:23] I don't want to bring this infirmity
[1:18:24] around and give glory to the devil. I
[1:18:26] want this infirmity has come for the
[1:18:27] will from by the will of God for his
[1:18:30] glory in my life. I'm going to overcome
[1:18:34] it. I'm going to overcome. Somebody say,
[1:18:37] "I'm going to overcome it."
[1:18:40] I am stepping into that place of
[1:18:43] maturity that says, "My lover has given
[1:18:46] me his word and I believe it."
[1:18:50] Somebody has got to say enough's enough.
[1:18:59] What brings him glory? What brings him
[1:19:01] honor? When the bride takes his word
[1:19:06] and manifests it,
[1:19:09] he goes,
[1:19:11] "Gosh, come over here. Let me give you a
[1:19:13] kiss." Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] Amen.
[1:19:17] He just falls in love with you over and
[1:19:19] over and over because every time you
[1:19:21] turn around, you're just proving his
[1:19:22] word to be true. You're proving you love
[1:19:24] him. You're well, praise the Lord. Can
[1:19:27] you say amen? You see, our desire is for
[1:19:31] his word now. Amen. He said that's
[1:19:35] what's the matter today is we're full of
[1:19:36] theology without any dynamics in it. In
[1:19:39] other words, you you've got to have the
[1:19:41] spark to the gasoline or the gasoline is
[1:19:44] no more. it it's not even as good as
[1:19:46] water as long as is as as it hasn't got
[1:19:49] a spark to it. So So that's the way no
[1:19:51] matter how well we're taught. Somebody
[1:19:54] say no matter how well we're taught
[1:19:57] how well we believe how much the Bible
[1:20:01] is they say is true and we believe it's
[1:20:04] all true and it's got to be the dynamics
[1:20:07] has got to be there. The spark to set
[1:20:11] the word of fire and make it start
[1:20:14] rolling. Somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:20:16] Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] It's got to have that. If you don't have
[1:20:19] it, the church will sit still. The cars
[1:20:22] set still. You'll sit still. No matter
[1:20:25] what how much you say. I sympathize and
[1:20:28] I believe the word. Amen. You've got to
[1:20:31] have something to spark that off to make
[1:20:34] that 100% octane to go to firing. And
[1:20:37] the big church of God will go to moving
[1:20:40] on. It's got to take the dynamics with
[1:20:43] the mechanics. Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:20:46] It's got to take the dynamics with the
[1:20:49] mechanics.
[1:20:51] It's got to take the dynamics with the
[1:20:53] mechanics.
[1:20:55] Oh, you say, "Well, brother, we can't do
[1:20:58] it." There's where desperation comes in
[1:21:01] and saying, "God, I want your word
[1:21:03] living in me. I want it living in my
[1:21:06] home." Can you say, "Amen."
[1:21:10] Desperation.
[1:21:12] Amen.
[1:21:14] Now he said, I think, Amen. He he he
[1:21:19] says, now we're lacking the dynamic
[1:21:21] power to press this word to make it live
[1:21:23] for this day. Martin Luther had the
[1:21:25] dynamics, mechanics and dynamics. John
[1:21:27] Wesley had them. The Pentecostal had
[1:21:29] them in their day. What about our day?
[1:21:31] What about our day? It's this is another
[1:21:33] time. The church, I love this part.
[1:21:37] Going back to the bride now. Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] And this is this is this is still Amen.
[1:21:42] This is in the same series, right? R
[1:21:43] right after the the invisible union of
[1:21:47] the bride. Amen. And he's and he's
[1:21:49] saying the church should be fully grown
[1:21:51] now, ready to go meet Christ with the
[1:21:55] manifestation of every blessing that he
[1:21:57] promised in the Bible, operating in that
[1:21:59] one great body where he promised he
[1:22:01] would meet the people and be worshiped
[1:22:03] in this great church of his. Someone
[1:22:06] says, "That's my guy.
[1:22:09] That's my Christ. He has paid the price.
[1:22:12] He has paid the price of redemption.
[1:22:14] He's brought me in. He Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:18] The life of the Holy Spirit has come
[1:22:21] back upon the believer to make that word
[1:22:24] to live.
[1:22:26] Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] Desperation.
[1:22:30] As I as I've been thinking about Oh God.
[1:22:35] Oh God.
[1:22:37] Oh God,
[1:22:42] you can't be desperate till God speaks
[1:22:44] to you.
[1:22:45] Oh church, rise and shake yourself.
[1:22:49] Be your conscience and wake yourself up
[1:22:50] in this hour. We must be desperate or
[1:22:53] perish. There's coming forth something
[1:22:56] from the Lord. And I know it as thus
[1:22:58] sayaeth the Lord. There's coming
[1:23:01] something.
[1:23:02] We'd better be desperate. It's between
[1:23:04] life and death. It'll pass right through
[1:23:06] us and we won't see it. Can you see?
[1:23:09] Amen. Get desperate about it. Oh my. How
[1:23:13] many wants to How many wants to be
[1:23:15] desperate?
[1:23:16] Desperate. Let me agonize for souls.
[1:23:21] Let me agonize.
[1:23:23] When you see souls struggling, they
[1:23:26] don't know how to surrender themselves
[1:23:27] to God.
[1:23:29] They don't know. And and and often times
[1:23:31] they can't surrender because they're in
[1:23:32] the chains.
[1:23:34] But if there's somebody in desperation
[1:23:38] saying, "God, I want you to fulfill your
[1:23:40] word. This is a perfect opportunity.
[1:23:41] You've sent them to me.
[1:23:44] I want your word to live.
[1:23:47] Reveal yourself." Well, can you say
[1:23:48] amen?
[1:23:50] You see, that's
[1:23:52] that's who we are. We're his bride.
[1:23:55] We've got the checkbook.
[1:23:58] No one else has my checkbook but Jesse.
[1:24:02] And I always tell her, she uses it too
[1:24:03] much. Amen.
[1:24:06] Right, brother Merl.
[1:24:14] Hey, I'm going to start a family feud
[1:24:16] right here. Amen.
[1:24:19] I'm not even looking over your way,
[1:24:20] Mary. Amen.
[1:24:23] We we we are we are anticipating
[1:24:28] God's word to be fulfilled.
[1:24:33] Anticipating
[1:24:37] he says when one goes agonizing when one
[1:24:40] agonizing soul one soul before God in
[1:24:44] sincerity done more to bring a revival
[1:24:46] than all the schools there was in the
[1:24:47] world. That's right. When one soul
[1:24:50] prayed through
[1:24:56] desperate about healing.
[1:25:00] He says, "I'm looking at Mrs. Mrs. Peck
[1:25:02] and Paul now. Is this Is this Mrs. Peck
[1:25:04] and Paul? Are you the one that had the
[1:25:06] boy here?" Something or another. Why?
[1:25:08] Well, here here's the woman sitting
[1:25:09] right here I was talking about. Just
[1:25:11] happened to look over and see her. Now,
[1:25:13] if God can do that for that little boy,
[1:25:16] it ought to throw you into desperation.
[1:25:18] A man from New Albany.
[1:25:21] He he may be here tonight. He's a friend
[1:25:23] to brother Robertson. Had a boy little
[1:25:25] boy here. I think his wife had a cancer
[1:25:28] once and was healed. And the little boy
[1:25:30] has got asthma so bad that he he just
[1:25:32] got in such just a bad shape. Little
[1:25:34] fella almost uh almost cancered throat
[1:25:37] himself and or he's almost got the man's
[1:25:42] uh cancer throat himself. And then he
[1:25:46] brought the little boy and said, "Yeah,
[1:25:48] I I see his hand." Yeah. back there in
[1:25:50] the back was prayed for this morning.
[1:25:53] See, desperation when the wife was about
[1:25:55] to die with cancer and he knowed that
[1:25:57] God could heal her. And if God could
[1:26:00] heal the wife, God can heal the boy. And
[1:26:02] it just threw throws into a state of
[1:26:05] desperation. See, you must come when
[1:26:08] you're desperate, then God is going to
[1:26:10] listen to you. But if you're just
[1:26:12] lawful, you don't care whether he does
[1:26:15] it or not. Well, then that's different.
[1:26:19] You say, you say you do, but it takes
[1:26:23] desperation
[1:26:26] to do it. Now,
[1:26:30] what what what am I getting out of this
[1:26:32] and what I'm hoping you're getting out
[1:26:33] of this is God's word is not just put
[1:26:37] there just to be put there.
[1:26:40] It's put there because he knows you're
[1:26:42] coming in this day and somebody's going
[1:26:44] to believe it.
[1:26:48] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:26:51] Amen.
[1:26:52] You see,
[1:26:54] there was there was an old grandfather.
[1:26:58] Amen. This really touched me as I was
[1:26:59] listening to this
[1:27:02] the other day. Right here in Louisville,
[1:27:05] Kentucky, not long ago, there was a very
[1:27:07] nice family of people. They had a sick
[1:27:09] baby. Called to pray for it. The doctor
[1:27:12] walked out of the hospital and what and
[1:27:14] and what about the baby? And he said,
[1:27:16] "The baby's dying. There is nothing else
[1:27:19] can be done for it. It's got leukemia.
[1:27:21] The baby has to die." I thought, "Oh,
[1:27:24] God, you ain't said that yet. You never
[1:27:27] witnessed that." Went and talked to the
[1:27:30] parents. The parents was crying and
[1:27:31] sobbing and their baby was gone as far
[1:27:33] as they know. But what did they do? The
[1:27:36] doctor was right. He everything that he
[1:27:39] know uh to do he he had done. Leukemia
[1:27:43] is a killer. Nothing else to stop it.
[1:27:45] the baby's going to die. But the old
[1:27:48] grandfather of that baby, you all know
[1:27:50] the case, that old grandfather of that
[1:27:52] baby come along and when he heard me
[1:27:54] speak about the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:56] Spirit, and I I used to remember years
[1:27:58] ago when an old preacher there said said
[1:28:00] there would there would be a time that
[1:28:02] people would receive the Holy Ghost
[1:28:03] again and signs and wonders would be
[1:28:05] done. And he went off into a little room
[1:28:09] to himself and he wouldn't stay with the
[1:28:11] son and daughter-in-law no more. He
[1:28:14] stayed there crying and praying. And
[1:28:15] when the old fella walked out of there,
[1:28:17] the sweat hanging across his bald
[1:28:19] forehead, his eyes are glistening. He
[1:28:23] said, "The baby will live." They said,
[1:28:26] "What?" He said, "Doctor, I respect you
[1:28:29] as a man of science. I respect you and
[1:28:31] your intelligence and what you have
[1:28:33] learned through medical research." But
[1:28:36] he said, "I've prayed and I prayed and I
[1:28:38] prayed until I surrendered everything I
[1:28:40] had to surrender. And the Holy Spirit
[1:28:43] said that baby will live. And it did.
[1:28:47] Why? He surrendered everything he had.
[1:28:50] God got a hold of him and could talk to
[1:28:53] him when he was just willing to
[1:28:55] surrender everything. Come on, church.
[1:28:59] Amen. I want the word of God to be
[1:29:00] fulfilled. It ain't the preacher coming.
[1:29:03] It ain't It ain't the evangelist coming.
[1:29:06] God, it's me and I mean business.
[1:29:11] It's me.
[1:29:14] I'm coming with the faith. I'm praying
[1:29:16] through. I'm believing God. I'm going to
[1:29:20] see the answer.
[1:29:26] But I need you to counsel and counsel
[1:29:27] and counsel. Why don't you pray through
[1:29:30] until the power of God comes down?
[1:29:35] Well,
[1:29:36] why don't we pray through? Oh, come on,
[1:29:39] church. The word is here. Do you believe
[1:29:43] what the prophet told us?
[1:29:46] It's just waiting
[1:29:48] for somebody.
[1:29:50] That's going to require some
[1:29:51] oldfashioned prayer.
[1:29:54] It's going to be some agonizing before
[1:29:56] God. It's going to be coming saying Lord
[1:29:59] just as they were agonizing. Amen. For
[1:30:02] in 1906 and the spirit of God came down
[1:30:05] and they agonized and agonized and
[1:30:08] prayed until they prayed through
[1:30:10] speaking in tongues and the power of God
[1:30:12] upon them. Amen. There is an exodus that
[1:30:15] is going on now. Are you hearing me?
[1:30:17] Amen. God, I want to agonize. We're
[1:30:20] going I I want to walk into this rapture
[1:30:22] under the authority of your word,
[1:30:24] believing every word as it has been
[1:30:27] said.
[1:30:28] Can you say amen? Yes. That's he says
[1:30:32] that's what we lack. We don't want to
[1:30:34] surrender our ways. You don't want to
[1:30:36] surrender your societies. You don't want
[1:30:38] to surrender the little click that you
[1:30:40] belong to. You don't want to surrender
[1:30:41] any time. You don't you you got to do
[1:30:43] this and that and the other instead of
[1:30:45] praying. You don't want to surrender
[1:30:46] things to God. God wants you to
[1:30:49] surrender. Amen. What more? What a whole
[1:30:53] lot more here I could say, but I haven't
[1:30:55] got time. God wants a complete surrender
[1:30:58] when you surrender everything. When you
[1:31:01] find out that I'm talk, what I'm talking
[1:31:03] about is the truth.
[1:31:08] Can you say amen?
[1:31:10] Desperation.
[1:31:16] The word is here
[1:31:18] and it's yours.
[1:31:24] The word is here
[1:31:28] and it's already been given by a prophet
[1:31:32] and said it is mine.
[1:31:35] You say, "Oh, brother wind, I long for
[1:31:39] it."
[1:31:40] Desperation
[1:31:43] will come comes from a love. And I I I I
[1:31:46] like that.
[1:31:48] It comes from a it it it create it it
[1:31:51] the love creates a desperation. A love
[1:31:54] for God creates desperation for his word
[1:31:58] to be proven right.
[1:32:01] That's right.
[1:32:03] Amen.
[1:32:05] now.
[1:32:06] And I I and I want to I I want to I want
[1:32:10] to read this to you if I can find it
[1:32:12] here.
[1:32:13] Hallelujah.
[1:32:15] [Music]
[1:32:16] I just love him.
[1:32:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:21] And I don't I can't find it. Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] Amen. Where he's talking about that. But
[1:32:28] the love
[1:32:30] Amen.
[1:32:32] He says the lack of love God. The love
[1:32:34] of God. I think the love of God causes
[1:32:36] the desperation. It's the God in you,
[1:32:40] the token inside of you. You see the
[1:32:43] conditions of times and the people
[1:32:45] waiting in the sin and it throws you in
[1:32:48] desperation
[1:32:52] because you know the word is true.
[1:32:56] Can you say amen?
[1:32:58] Hallelujah.
[1:33:01] Oh, glory to God. I love him so much
[1:33:03] here this morning or this evening.
[1:33:07] Amen. You see, there's got to be that
[1:33:12] for those of you who are looking for the
[1:33:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:17] Those of you that are that are crying
[1:33:20] saying, "God, I'm tired of I go and then
[1:33:23] I falter back again and then I'm just
[1:33:26] back." God's got a cure for that.
[1:33:30] He's got a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:32] that'll keep you right on that straight
[1:33:33] and narrow.
[1:33:35] It's the love of God on the inside of
[1:33:37] you. Sure, you're going to fall and make
[1:33:39] mistakes,
[1:33:41] but that's not the point. The point is
[1:33:43] the nature change on the inside of you.
[1:33:46] And there's where the Holy Ghost comes
[1:33:48] in and takes the old nature out and puts
[1:33:51] the new nature in.
[1:33:55] Hallelujah.
[1:33:57] Then you're going to get wounded. But
[1:33:59] you're wounded because you're on the
[1:34:00] you're on the you're you're out on the
[1:34:02] battlefront and you're fighting.
[1:34:07] That's a difference than being on the
[1:34:09] other side
[1:34:12] and and wanting to be on the other side.
[1:34:14] Being on the enemy's side and longing
[1:34:17] and wanting to be on the side of right,
[1:34:19] but yet well, praise the Lord. But when
[1:34:22] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:24] Ghost, you've been transferred.
[1:34:26] You have been you have been moved from
[1:34:30] this from the law of sin and death and
[1:34:33] you have been transformed. You have been
[1:34:36] brought over into the law of the spirit
[1:34:38] of life in Christ Jesus.
[1:34:40] Desperation. Brother Brandon would say
[1:34:42] that desperation would say amen.
[1:34:46] Hallelujah. He would say now he said the
[1:34:50] only way you'll ever be able to achieve
[1:34:52] the thing that you're wanting is to
[1:34:53] desperately come. I must have it
[1:34:56] tonight. I I get it now or I'm finished.
[1:35:00] Tomorrow's too late. I must have it.
[1:35:02] When you pray for the baptism of the
[1:35:04] Holy Spirit, the token, don't say,
[1:35:05] "Well, I'll go up and try." Lord, I'm a
[1:35:08] little tired. Oh, mercy. Stay in your
[1:35:11] seat. Don't even make an attempt. If you
[1:35:13] come and say, "I'll pass through the
[1:35:15] prayer line, put the oil on my head, and
[1:35:17] see if see if it does me any good." You
[1:35:19] might as well just sit where you're at
[1:35:21] until you get to that place. until the
[1:35:24] whole church gets to a place that is
[1:35:26] between death and life. You've got to
[1:35:28] have it now or perish. And then God will
[1:35:32] move on the scene. It takes desperation
[1:35:35] to bring God
[1:35:37] on the scene.
[1:35:42] That desperation,
[1:35:44] that calling out, it don't matter.
[1:35:48] Desperation.
[1:35:52] desperation knows that God's got my
[1:35:55] answer.
[1:35:57] You you you you you know you get to that
[1:36:00] point, I've done tried it all the world.
[1:36:02] I've done tried it here and there. I'm
[1:36:04] desperate. There ain't nothing going to
[1:36:06] keep me from the house of God.
[1:36:09] I I'm going to be here early. I'm going
[1:36:11] to I'm going to be seeking the Lord
[1:36:13] because I I want to make sure that I get
[1:36:15] what I need. When I come to church, I
[1:36:17] come because I want to receive something
[1:36:19] from the Lord. I'm desperate about it.
[1:36:21] I've got to have the answer.
[1:36:26] Can you say amen?
[1:36:28] Desperation
[1:36:31] transforms
[1:36:34] it. It makes a different person out of
[1:36:37] us
[1:36:40] because we don't care how we get it, how
[1:36:45] what we have to do,
[1:36:49] we're going to get
[1:36:51] what God has promised is ours.
[1:36:55] Can you say amen
[1:36:57] if the musicians would come?
[1:37:03] Oh God,
[1:37:10] on the Lamb's book of life, I want my
[1:37:12] name wrote. I want to remember. I want
[1:37:15] him to remember me when the role is
[1:37:16] called.
[1:37:18] And it throws me in desperation.
[1:37:22] After I have, as the Apostle Paul said,
[1:37:25] I after I have preached the gospel,
[1:37:27] shall I be a stowway or cast off?
[1:37:32] it could happen.
[1:37:35] So it throws me into a desperate stage,
[1:37:38] a desperation to think after all the
[1:37:40] years of preaching,
[1:37:43] could I come to the place where I could
[1:37:46] fail him? What's the next move? What
[1:37:49] must I do next? It throws me into a
[1:37:52] nervous stage.
[1:37:54] What can I do?
[1:37:56] It throws me to the mountains and to the
[1:37:59] valleys.
[1:38:00] It's hard because when I'm with the
[1:38:03] people, I I've got to be all things to
[1:38:05] all men and I that I might win some to
[1:38:08] Christ. Yet the tokens always before me.
[1:38:12] I see things coming up. You can't tell
[1:38:14] the people. You see different things and
[1:38:16] you're forbidden.
[1:38:18] Them visions they call on sometimes
[1:38:20] they'd be sorry if you did tell them.
[1:38:24] You know better than to do that.
[1:38:27] So then you you go so far in visions
[1:38:30] until everything becomes a vision and it
[1:38:32] throws you into a nervous stage.
[1:38:36] You look and say, "Am I in a vision?"
[1:38:39] Like sitting right here. Is this a
[1:38:40] vision?
[1:38:42] Is this
[1:38:44] where am I really standing?
[1:38:47] You overwork yourself. You overt tax
[1:38:49] yourself. You find out things about
[1:38:51] people you wish you didn't know. the
[1:38:53] people that desires these things to know
[1:38:55] these things. You don't realize what
[1:38:58] type of ministry it cost. You you you
[1:39:01] don't know what goes with it. And then
[1:39:03] it throws me into desperation. Lord, I
[1:39:05] know I'm going to have to answer. Jack
[1:39:08] Moore said to me one time, "I'd hate to
[1:39:10] have to answer like you will have to
[1:39:11] answer at the day of judgment.
[1:39:14] God has put those people into your hands
[1:39:16] and you're going to have to give an
[1:39:17] account for every one of them. You're
[1:39:19] going to answer." It's been about 15
[1:39:20] years ago, maybe 18.
[1:39:23] Since then, I've been in a desperation.
[1:39:27] What will I do?
[1:39:30] Desperation,
[1:39:40] a full surrender.
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:48] This is just really part two of Sunday
[1:39:50] morning.
[1:39:52] I preached on surrender Sunday.
[1:39:56] Tonight, desperation.
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:03] I'll have to give an account
[1:40:06] of the ministry of his word.
[1:40:15] I'll have to give an account for every
[1:40:17] soul.
[1:40:25] Have I told the neighbor
[1:40:28] about the love of Jesus?
[1:40:33] Have I reached out?
[1:40:36] I'm his body.
[1:40:40] His heart oozes in redemption. What does
[1:40:42] my heart ooze? My heart oozes for his
[1:40:45] will to be complete.
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:50] Brother Wendle, they just don't deserve
[1:40:52] it.
[1:40:53] Neither do you.
[1:40:58] Oh, but they've fallen and fallen and
[1:40:59] fallen and fallen. What Jesus said that
[1:41:01] we should re that that that we should
[1:41:03] forgive 70 times seven 490 times.
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:15] How many in this community knows?
[1:41:24] Am I desperate about this call that God
[1:41:27] has put on my heart? Is it is it really
[1:41:29] in me
[1:41:33] to minister to my Lord?
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:42] Now, the feminist movement says, "Well,
[1:41:44] I'll just give you what I'm going to
[1:41:45] give you, and you've got to accept it."
[1:41:46] That's not the way it goes.
[1:41:50] We've got to give him what he what
[1:41:53] pleases him.
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:42:00] I want to please him.
[1:42:04] I want
[1:42:07] What's your will? Why Why am I here?
[1:42:12] Why am I here? Why are you here?
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:20] Oh, don't let me miss any opportunity.
[1:42:26] aspiration begins to cause us to really
[1:42:31] look inward and say, "Oh,
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:37] I want to steal away.
[1:42:41] I want to steal away. I want I want your
[1:42:44] will
[1:42:47] to be done in me.
[1:42:53] Let me hear your voice.
[1:42:58] Let me not miss one opportunity.
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:07] I
[1:43:09] I I want your word.
[1:43:12] I I I I want your word to be impeccable.
[1:43:15] I want your word to be above reproach. I
[1:43:18] want your word to be manifested. I I
[1:43:22] want sinners saved, alcoholics
[1:43:25] delivered,
[1:43:28] lives restored,
[1:43:32] souls saved.
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:40] But it's not dead theology.
[1:43:44] It's the living reality.
[1:43:47] Amen.
[1:43:49] I know it's a Wednesday night. We try to
[1:43:52] get us out early on these Wednesday
[1:43:54] nights.
[1:43:57] I
[1:43:59] I was going into my studies for some
[1:44:02] teaching and I I just I I some good
[1:44:06] stuff there too. But when I come for
[1:44:07] tonight, it just it just all went blank.
[1:44:10] It all looked like it was just a blank
[1:44:11] piece of paper.
[1:44:14] But this one here
[1:44:19] standing out to me tonight. I know this
[1:44:21] is what the Lord wanted me to minister
[1:44:27] more than money and riches, more than
[1:44:30] wealth and fame.
[1:44:37] I'm desperate for you, Lord.
[1:44:53] I don't want to compromise
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:03] is agonizing with God to fulfill his
[1:45:06] word.
[1:45:11] through me.
[1:45:14] Father,
[1:45:16] as your spirit has settled over the
[1:45:18] building,
[1:45:24] I know for one my
[1:45:28] heart.
[1:45:33] I can see the positive promises.
[1:45:38] Lord Jesus,
[1:45:42] I believe they're for this day.
[1:45:47] Lord, I'm asking right now that you not
[1:45:50] let me get bogged down with
[1:45:54] the things of this world.
[1:45:59] God, there's a cry in your bride here at
[1:46:03] New Life
[1:46:06] for your presence to be
[1:46:09] your word to be manifested.
[1:46:13] We can feed you your promises,
[1:46:17] not in word form. You gave them to us in
[1:46:19] word form, but we're giving them back to
[1:46:21] you in spirit form, manifested form.
[1:46:28] We accept this responsibility.
[1:46:30] We accepted it the day that we said, "I
[1:46:32] do." This is a union.
[1:46:37] We've taken on your name
[1:46:42] and we're committed to your word.
[1:46:47] Father, we report for duty.
[1:46:52] Jesus, we love you.
[1:46:56] We love you with all of our heart.
[1:47:02] Lord, I pray that if
[1:47:04] there's someone that is in desperation
[1:47:06] here today,
[1:47:10] in desperation for healing or a miracle,
[1:47:16] family situation,
[1:47:19] I pray,
[1:47:23] oh God, that you would hear their
[1:47:25] desperate cry.
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:30] I pray Lord that you would help us as
[1:47:32] members of your bride to step up to the
[1:47:35] plate.
[1:47:39] We're not a little girl.
[1:47:46] We're the lady of your dreams.
[1:47:49] We're your bride.
[1:47:53] And we say
[1:47:55] that we love your word and we believe
[1:47:58] every word to be true.
[1:48:04] Though the enemy wants to keep the word
[1:48:06] from coming to pass,
[1:48:09] it is our every ambition
[1:48:15] to hold true until that word does come
[1:48:17] to pass. We are believing for the great
[1:48:21] almighty God in flesh.
[1:48:24] our flesh
[1:48:27] in the name of Jesus.
[1:48:31] I thank you for it, Lord.
[1:48:35] I thank you for it, Jesus.
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:51] for you. Oh,

[1:49:49] Has it been a while since desperation
[1:49:51] has struck?
[1:49:58] Has it been a while?
[1:50:02] Oh, God.

[1:54:11] can sing that that old song. I love you.
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:32] Because
[1:54:36] Jacob got desperate.
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:42] Jacob had to get really desperate with
[1:54:44] God.
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:53] He had to get desperate.
[1:54:58] Jacob had got complacent with his
[1:54:59] birthight.
[1:55:04] Settle down. He got the birthight and
[1:55:06] thought that was all there was to it.
[1:55:18] But the prophet said
[1:55:21] there would be no inheritance until
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:30] he said Jacob he was a man. He kind of
[1:55:32] carefree boy. He he thought in his own
[1:55:36] mind. He knew that he had the bride's
[1:55:38] right. Meant everything to him. But he
[1:55:40] he didn't care how he had just so he got
[1:55:43] it. And after he got it, he thought
[1:55:44] everything was all right
[1:55:46] because he had the birthright and he
[1:55:48] thought
[1:55:50] the thing was settled.
[1:56:03] He would say Pentecost thought that they
[1:56:05] had it. And
[1:56:09] he said, "There's where you failed.
[1:56:12] [Music]
[1:56:18] You thought because you were born of the
[1:56:19] spirit, born of the spirit of God, the
[1:56:21] birthright that settled it. That only
[1:56:23] starts it.
[1:56:26] You remember the message of hear ye him,
[1:56:28] how that the child after he was born in
[1:56:30] the family become a son.
[1:56:33] It had rights to the birthright.
[1:56:36] But it had to be proven a child trained.
[1:56:39] that didn't prove that an obedient child
[1:56:41] to the father's will
[1:56:44] and it must be he didn't get it
[1:56:49] didn't become the heir
[1:56:51] it aired nothing yet it was a son but
[1:56:54] aired nothing
[1:56:56] if he wasn't interested in the father's
[1:56:59] work
[1:57:04] now this is in desperation
[1:57:08] because he wasn't interested
[1:57:11] in the father's work.
