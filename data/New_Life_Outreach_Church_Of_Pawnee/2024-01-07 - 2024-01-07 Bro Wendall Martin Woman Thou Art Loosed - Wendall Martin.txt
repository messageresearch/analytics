to the family of God amen amen so glad amen let's look here in in Luke 13 And1 praise the Lord and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath and behold there was a woman woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself and when Jesus saw her he called her to him and he said unto her woman thou wart loosed from thine infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indign because that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which man ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the Sabbath day and the Lord answered him and said thou hypocrite do not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering and ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath bound Lo these 18 years be loosed from the bond of on the Sabbath day and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the Glorious things that were done by him why don't we go to the Lord in prayer and as we pray let's remember those that are sick this morning morning Amen brother as it's already been mentioned brother Joe and the Lancaster family and and um any of the others that are that are sick whether they be here or at home father we want to thank you today for your amazing love thank you Lord for the power of that love Lord that has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost ghost Lord you see all of our our sick ones Lord that are uh both here and and and and abroad just ask Lord that you would help them Lord that you would bring healing to them and encourage them we thank you that you Lord that that the that the remedy of the blood of Jesus Christ is just as real for colds and sniffles and and sinuses and flu Lord hard as it is for cancer or anything else Lord You're our healer period that's that's just that's just plain and simple and we thank you for that and we come to you Lord and ask for healing for all of those who aren't feeling well today I pray Lord that you would be with us here in the service this morning that you would Lord that you would be lifted up and that your presence would be felt among us and that you would speak to us Lord oh God we love you we thank you for your grace and your mercies and we give ourselves to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen want to this this scripture stood out to me the other day as I was um looking as I as I read it and I thought you know I'm just I'm I'm is going to minister a little bit on it here this morning and and um amen this is a a powerful scripture first of all I want us to notice that um Jesus amen was in the church on on Sabbath day and so uh Jesus believed in going to church amen and uh amen uh he he was he says he was teaching in one of the synagogues and and uh Luke 4 4:16 says that Jesus had a habit of going to the church on the Sabbath day and um so Jesus believed in going to church and I I I I think it's a wonderful thing to be here in the church here this morning can you amen now we we see here that this woman had been bound by by this Spirit of infirmity for for a long time amen for 18 years and she could not lift herself up amen she couldn't stand up or wct she uh uh you know couldn't stand tall and and straight as as as that which is reckon to man's honor and I begin to think a little bit of of this scripture and as we as we deal with the uh the natural infirmity I also want us to look at the spiritual infirmities because amen I think sometimes the the spirit man can be a little um uh uh can can be bound as well amen can be uh bowled over as well she this woman could not could could not stand upright she amen she wasn't herself she didn't look herself she she was um um you know maybe maybe she you know looked um mean maybe she was dismissed by Messi a society as a misfit maybe amen but but regardless of where she was she had been doing this she had been this way for 18 years amen but she was still very valuable uh a human being amen God seeing something in her it it's something about her attracted Christ the Bible did didn't say that she came to the Lord the scripture says that Jesus called unto her and told her to come to him that's right I I I I want to I I I want to say this morning every human being is valuable to the Lord as as we just look over some of these verses here God's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen I and I I I also think you should never judge the book by its cover amen I you know she she was just as precious uh uh human being as as as anyone else she was she had a spirit of infirmity man you know I think all life is precious I think Born life is precious unborn life is precious life is precious period amen that's the reason we don't believe in abortions and amen we we we we believe that any life that God has put here on this Earth we should honor that and we should be thankful to God Amen for for life because all life comes from God all life comes from God I I don't care whether you belong to this church or whether you belong to the Methodist Church or whether you belong to the Satan Church or whether you amen what church you belong to all life is precious to the Lord how many believes that amen you you you don't have to agree with me to to be precious with God I don't have to agree with you God loves humans God loves life God's the author of Life am amen no matter how you got here this morning you amen it it it doesn't matter it don't matter whether amen if you if you came from holy wedlock or or whether you came from a shack up I don't care how you got here this morning all life is precious to the Lord and God loves every one of you just the same amen I I I I I like that there there was something about her Affliction that attracted the that attracted the the attention of Jesus now here they are they're in church together amen Jes Jesus is up there teaching he sees this woman that is bound over that is so bold over she can't stand upright amen she had lost dignity she amen was embarrassed no doubt in the way that that that she she was some of the scholars says that amen she would go into convulsions and and and and and just shake so so badly there amen and and and yet Jesus in the in in the midst of the church service Jesus stops and talks to the woman that had an Affliction amen GE he's not trying to sidestep her he's not trying to say you know she needs to be put uh uh somewhere else because she's distracting the service she says he says won't you come up to the front row come on well praise the Lord amen I I I I'm thankful for that here this morning amen now look at this woman she was bound but the scripture says amen uh that she was a Believer she she was a Seed of Abraham she had come to church to and she kept her vows to Jehovah regardless of her condition she kept her position all of these years as a Believer believing amen uh in God knowing that the Affliction is not of God how many knows your Affliction is not not of God Amen those things that you battle with are not of God sickness is not of God demons are there trying to to bring sickness and and make Havoc of your of your spirit man well can you say man amen the scripture says there in verse 16 that Satan bound This Woman This Woman was bound by the the evil spirit a and he called her to him amen I I like that song he came looking for me praise the Lord amen he the great Creator had seen value in this in this precious woman now the ruler of the synagogue as we just sort of lay out a a a little bit of a platform here amen uh he was very indignant he he uh you know religious leaders can sometimes be your worst enemy amen they they won't go in as Jesus said they amen there in Matthew 23 and 13 it says be wo unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye that uh them that are enter uh entering to go in and and so we can see uh uh that these that the scripture says that the ruler was was indignant he was he was uh amen upset that Jesus would even heal on the Sabbath day he was he was Hallelujah you know I think church should be the place where the Miracles take place I I think that I think church should be the place that amen where the power of God is believ well can you say Amen you know I I I want to be known as one of those preachers that that that that can hold the two-handed sword how many wants to be one of those kind of Believers that that that that is known to hold a two-edged sword a two-handed sword amen not just puts you foot with the devil and say well amen you just got to live in your Affliction and you just got to live that way I say that God is big I say God's our healer I say God's our deliverer amen can you say amen I believe that God Is A Healer but you see these men were too sissified to pick up that who two and handed sword brother Brandon would say many of those men don't know what it what it is to pack a sword and and get out there a two-handed sword on the front line they they don't know what a battle is to fight against the enemy they get out here and they're smart men theologians brilliant men who can stand with put a sermon out there H that's just so touched up and and also can talk with such language till Webster would hardly know what they're saying they've got degrees in the college and that's all right when you're talking to an intellectual group but but that's looking for a church home but when you're out there on the Battlefront those men want more than that they've got to see the power of almighty God in manifestation or you'll never sell it to them they've got to see Christ in his resurrection yes sir can I hear a yes sir here this morning amen those men don't know what it is to hold a two-ended sword to fight Toe to Toe with the Enemy there where demons and witch doctors and everything else standing there challenging you on every hand where men who read the Bible say if Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever let me see the Holy Spirit perform like it did back there you can't take a scholarship and do that it takes the power and resurrection of Jesus Christ to produce that well can you say amen amen so we're not here this morning I don't think we should come to church just to come and have an intellectual Gathering I I I think the power of the Holy should Spirit should be here on the Sabbath day amen I think I think when we come to church we should expect the supernatural in our church I I think when we go to prayer we should expect the supernatural to be with us in our prayer amen now now now Jesus turns around and he's a little he's a little gets a little indignant himself amen and he says you hypocrite amen why shouldn't this woman be loosed Amen on the Sabbath day she she's been tormented by the evil spirit she's she's been amen oppressed for 18 years Satan has bound this woman and here she is the Seed of Abraham this woman is needing rest from the oppression of the enemy this woman is needing Amen to lay it down lay down amen her burden and and to understand that God is is the Healer and I have come to loose her and to set her free amen oh Hallelujah I I I say here this morning what is the church all about amen is it not are we not the bride body of Jesus Christ now I know this is going to be a little simple here this morning I I just want to try to build some Faith here amen because if we're the bride body of Jesus Christ it doesn't mean that that we are free from sickness and we're free from Affliction it doesn't mean that Satan isn't going to attack Us in fact amen if you are a Believer Satan is going to attack you Satan is going to try amen to to to get you to lay down your weapon and I I I I think church services are a wonderful thing amen what what is this about oh can you say amen I I I pray amen that the church never becomes a lodge to where we're just here here uh on a weekly on a weekly Gathering and a lodge to where we just belong to a certain uh a certain belief but I I want God to always feel at home in our church I I want I now now remember Jesus comes to church amen where the he believes in going to church amen and you believe in going to church but Jesus believes in the power of of the Holy Spirit to set the captives free while in church amen amen amen to set those captives free Amen to break up you know you you you see we we we don't want it to be a song a poem and a and a sermon and a Sunday dinner on the grounds we we we are a Sanctified group The reason we come in on on these Sundays is is we are sanctifying ourselves we are gathering together we're we're we're Binding Together the body of Christ and we've been all week on the job we amen we we we've been raising our children we've a we we've gone through a lot of of things but but when we come to church hallelujah we're coming to meet together we're coming to speak Christ we're coming to bring our faith together we're coming to to see God to come down Among Us I I I I think today amen I'm thankful for one of the for these kinds of of of of sanctification ations and pulling ourselves together can you say amen amen Jehovah there in in in in Isaiah 58 and five he says is it is it uh such a fast that I have chosen a day for a man to afflict a soul is it to bow down his head as a bull rush to to spread sackcloth and Ashes under him wil thou call this a fast an acceptable day to the Lord is not this the fast that I have chosen to loose the bands of the the wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed Go free and that ye break every yoke what can you say amen I I think that's what God shows up to church for God shows up to church not to make intellectual Giants he shows up to church because the power of His Spirit wants to be expressed right here in our midst I don't think Jesus looked at that woman there and thinking oh my why did she show up today here I am the Messiah amen it's going to look bad if I don't do something Jesus came to Earth to set the captives free Jesus came where can you say amen hallelujah amen God is concerned he oh yes you see the church services are powerful because he's in the building amen if the spirit that raised up Christ from the de dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal body IES Amen brother you need to be set free on the Lord's day amen if you're needing if you're here and you're needing some healing in your body you're needing some some some Deliverance in your mind I want to say today we are here I know now amen some of you are saying do you even know what the Lord's day is it's on the Sabbath is on Saturday yes I know but we are the Church of the Living God and we are here today on Sunday and I'm here to tell you God shows up on Sunday where two or three are gathered together in my name name I will be there in their midst that's right oh Hallelujah well can you say Amen so when I'm coming to church not just another service oh but I'm expecting to receive amen Jesus at another church service he stood up in the in the temple on the Sabbath and he was declaring I am God's anointed Messiah look here in Isaiah amen there and and and and it tells there that that he uh uh uh there in Luke 4:16 he says he come to Nazareth where it been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophets Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me hallelujah oh when God comes in the building and and and lets you know I I am God's anointed Messiah I am God's anointed word when the word is walked in the room and the word is made flesh Among Us and the word says I will heal oh hallelujah amen what have we experienced in this generation we've experienced God greater than amen any other generation since Christ was on the earth why to let us know that God shows up to church Hallelujah he's anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he's anointed me Amen to heal the brokenhearted he's anointed me to preach Deliverance to the captives amen he's anointed me to to to preach the recovering of the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord I say Christ is our Sabbath Christ is our rest Christ is our healer can you say man now brother Brandon would say in the church age book he said consider this since it is the blood of God it is a perfect blood and if it and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation now that woman amen now this was this was in her physical body but Jesus came not to just do the physical body but this Blood of God is so perfect that When God Says be thou loosed he he takes away the very Act of condemnation the very reason for condemnation against you well can you say amen amen that word loose is to release it is to set free it is to release you and to set into motion so so what it is is to release you from this one and set you into motion somewhere else hallelujah amen what what the scripture says there is he has loosed us from the powers of darkness and has initiated us into the kingdom of his dear son amen he has loosed us from the powers of sin and unbelief and initiated well Hallelujah he that you cannot just be loosed and then amen remain in the same condition you are loosed so that you can now walk upright this little lady was loosed from that demon that had her bound and now she could rise up in the newness and walk with the Lord can you say amen amen now now we don't want to be bound while we're sitting in in in here on this service this morning on the Lord's day amen we don't want to smile and raise our hands and amen but our spirits but the spirits of Torment are haunting our Spirits even now amen Bound by past mistakes Bound by this I think there's a lot that needs to hear Woman Thou Art Loos if we can hear the words of the Lord this morning you see I don't feel that that this uh that we would necessarily have to hear it in an audible voice I feel like the message of the hour has come in our generation to say woman thou heart loosed you are loosed from denominationalism you are loosed from dogmas and opinions you are loosed amen from those that tried to keep you bound you are loosed you are set free now your faith can soar up into the heavens and you can experience God you can experience God on the Lord's day amen I just want to tell you right now amen let's just switch gears for a moment amen we know what the Lord's day is it's not a day of the week it's not a day of the year but the Lord's day is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that baptism of the Holy Ghost will take you up into those higher ribs to where you can walk with God yourself well glory to God oh now EES Eevees preachers you know right there whispering in your ears sometimes and tells you well you don't want to make a scene in the church you don't you don't want people to think that you have problems you don't you don't want to make a move but I'm here to tell you I've come to church to come into the presence of God how about you this morning I've come to chur Church to entertain his presence in me hallelujah amen John said amen the scripture says that John was caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day amen now it wasn't just a certain time of the day it wasn't just a certain time of the week but this was that rest that Jesus was to come so you don't necessarily have to receive your healing on a certain day you can believe God right now any day of the week and experience the supernatural in you hallelujah what can you sayen now now Miracles when those Miracles come that g when Lazarus was one of the greatest Miracles that Jesus ever performed amen Lazarus was there in the grave for 4 days amen we understand as as you know that that that corruption had already set in his nose had already sunk in there was already he he was already uh uh he was stinking he was he you know he he he was decaying and when Jesus came forth and called him out of the Grave amen he he came forth he was living he was alive well praise the Lord but the scripture says that he was still bound and and Jesus says I want you to loose him loose him you see there amen the scripture says there in John 11:44 he says and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go well glory to God Amen lose him oh Hallelujah brother I I I what what I my my thoughts here this morning I I don't want my faith to amen I'm thankful to for salvation I'm thankful to be a part of the kingdom of God I'm thankful but brother I don't want to be sitting in a church all bound up I want the power I don't want to be praying all bound up I don't want to be having my morning devotions all bound up he says loose him and let him go won't you turn to your neighbor and say loose him and let him go hallelujah oh yes amen loose him let him go you see he's alive but he needs to be loosed he has a purpose to fulfill let him go he has a savior to worship loose him because the world has to hear his testimony let him go loose him come on amen praise the Lord the whole death in the first place amen and and it was the Bible says amen that the whole death was for the glory of the Lord because God was fixing to get glory god was fixing to get honor well glory to God just as just as God done that in the Dark Ages that was nothing that was nothing new to God God knew that the church was going to go through the cycle of death God knew that the Catholic Church would Reign God knew these things but the but the fact was God has a purpose amen she was to rise in this last day but not just rise she must be loosed loosed from what she's got to be loosed from the grave clothes of of the Dark Ages man's opinions man's interpret ation man's this and that you've got to let go of all of that and be loosed and it takes the spirit of the Lord to do so it's not a good amen this message is not just another opinion it's not just a a a you know fixing doctrines it's not just turning a a a corner amen or you know a new Leaf no it's the power of God that set us free from those bondages of the past last amen can you say Amen loose him loose him loose him and let him go amen now Hallelujah some of us can be right right here this morning and and we're going around the same old Mira go around but I'm here to tell you we can be loosed can you say Amen oh yes man you you remember the unbelieving preachers that was scolling the crippled boy with polio and and and brother bradam had had given this this boy he needed some kind of a consolation of his healing and and brother Bram had said well by his stripes you're already healed and and and and and and he and he just he was having a struggle and brother brother bradam says wherever you go you testify just get out there and testify that God has healed you amen just just bring it right back you've been prayed for you believe that and and and of course you guys remember the story amen he went home testifying and and finally there was there was some more preachers it was the preachers that were saying now listen you're bringing a reproach you're bringing a reproach on our church here now and you're bringing a reproach on Christ saying that you're healed and you've got polio buddy you you've you've not you see there's got to be a releasing of the faith before there can be a releasing of the bondage we've got to be set free here and here in order to experience it everywhere else yes sir come on and that's what brother brandham gave him matter of fact I think I've got I I I'll try to break in here uh he says up up here at C Tabernacle when when we had that meeting the crippled boy that came in there and was pray for many of you was there to see it he he's they they brought him back in the emergency room and Billy led him to me and they they had him on the platform three or four nights there on the on in the building and he didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the prayer in the emergency room and I I went in there and prayed and looked at him he said Mr Brandon C can you tell me some consolation I said yes sir son polio got you this way he said yes that's right I said your name is such and such you come from a certain place that's right he said but what about my healing I said by his stripes you are healed we went home testifying amen he went home testifying giving God praise and he brought such a reproach and they they claim in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers came in and sat him down and said you must stop doing that you're bringing a reproach on the Coss listen since when amen standing for the word of God bring brings reproach okay you're not going to bring reproach for standing upon the word of God stand upon the word of God I don't care what you feel what you see what the enemy says stand up on that word man he says and the young man he he said you're bringing a reproach upon the cause and the young man sitting there and said mister if you were sitting where I am if you were in the chair that I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to rob me of the last hope I got in Christ he said by his stripes I am healed and he no more than said that sitting there paralyzed feet hands body back no more than he said there out of that chair he went glorifying God why he says his natural senses said he'll St there and and the doctor said you'll sit there forever but the six sense said by his stripes I am heal loose loose now that woman was loose from an infirmity but in this day there's been something sad to another woman and it says woman thou art loosed you're loose from denominationalism you're loose from interpretation you're loose amen from emotionalism you are loose you are free to believe God that's right amen can you say Amen then you Cast Away everything contrary to the what word of the Lord says

Pentecost but I was hobbling along due to the injuries oh can you say amen amen but oh when he came and he says come here oh my life changed aren't you glad that he called you and you weren't doing jumping jack trying to catch him there's nothing in the scripture that said she was trying to get his attention amen that it looked but you see he came looking for me he came looking for me oh can you say Amen what did the scripture say he says he had needs to go to Samaria he goes to Samaria and he finds another woman now this woman amen was so bound she was so bound that that when he come in and and and and it send his disciples to go get some lunch and and and so there he's there and he's weary and she comes in and and and she says he says won't you give me to drink and and and and and and

life was was defiled it was it was messed up we understand that in in in in her childhood her her her mom and dad didn't care for her like like they should have cared for her and here she was thrown out there in the world and now her life's a mess and here she comes to a well and here's another man and this man is already trying to make passes to her oh but this was not just any ordinary man amen

Bound by the devil come on Amen Hallelujah well praise the Lord he says he says uh if you ask me I'll give you a drink and you won't ever thirst again she says how can you give me to drink the well is deep and you have nothing to draw with he says but if you ask me for water I will give you something that'll just gusher out of your bellies living water and you will never thirst again and she looks and she says watch this watch this this she earnestly looks at him and says I want some of this water all right could you give me I've been to the church they've all put me out I'm here in the middle of the day because I'm not allowed with the girls the virgin girls and the married girls I'm not allowed to come here I have to come here alone Hallelujah come on Jesus says won't you go and get your husband he says here it goes here it goes it's going south now I've already been put out of all the others I've already been done wrong I've she said I don't have a husband yes he says you've told the truth you've had five and the one you're living with is not yours she turned around who are you who are you what was taking place the word was anointed for that hour power and the Word was breaking the chains yeah that no one else could see the word was doing something that religion could never do the word was doing something that the churches could know come on church I'm here to tell you we're living in the Lord's day we're living under the anointing of the son of man it's the son of man Ministry with the son of man word and it's setting the captives free today because he whom the sun sets free woman thou aren't loosed and the scripture says that whatever took place she dropped her water pot and she took off running into the seity and says come and see this Prophet come see the Messiah come see the man who told me oh come see the man who has Set Me Free you see freedom is a precious thing freedom to believe regardless of the circumstance freedom to accept freedom freedom freedom that when God walks in the building and you're so used to being looked over and God says I've come for you freedom in leosa where they pushed you off to the side and you're just look one like one of those Cults or you look like one of those strange people you look like one of Hallelujah and then Jesus shows up word made flesh and says I come to your well praise the Lord did zachus come down out of that tree hey man I'm going to go to your house today I I've got well no you don't want to come to my house oh yes Rebecca's already been praying for you I I I I've got a dinner date with you I'm going to your house [Applause] zachus Freedom come to zakus Freedom come to the woman at the well Freedom come to the the woman that had been bound for 18 years Freedom can you say man freedom freedom I I I I you know I freedom from a wounded Spirit how many knows that that that there in Proverbs y you know where that's at sister Keys uh uh uh uh uh Proverbs 18 amen um something about a wounded a wounded spirit is stronger than um than the bars of a City or Gates of a city y y know the scripture I'm talking about man yeah no that's that's a good one amen put that back up there we'll we we'll do that the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded Spirit who can bear I bet the other one's right next to it is that part of it about bars hallelujah amen oh yes it's it's the the it's it's stronger a brother offended is harder to be one than a strong City it's it's it's one that is can you say Amen but the loosening power of the blood of Jesus Christ that comes through the word of God now the blood has already and I'm not going to hold you long I know as brother murl says I know there's there's some that are aren't feeling here well here this morning but but now now listen the blood of the Covenant has all already been has already uh been spilled how many believe that 2,000 years ago amen but but the problem was the word is the only way you can get the blood brother Brandon put it like this he says the blood Veil is brought down through the preaching of the word so while the word is being preached the blood Veil comes down for you to be washed cleansed healed delivered set free can you say Amen but when it was bound the Holy Spirit was bound not behind the word it was bound amen by Creeds it was bound by dogmas the Holy Spirit the blood was still there amen but there was a wall of petition between you and your answer amen that wall of petition was there so it took the son of man to come back and bring the word back to life again amen it took God to on Earth Earth to reveal what he already spoke how do we know this is because when the word come in our day it discerned Hearts it discerned Minds it told you where you came from it told you what the doctor said it told you can you say Amen what was this for to let you know that there was the son of man s o n the anointing of the son back on the Earth again and the discernment at the woman at the well and the man Christ Jesus the man who said woman thou art loosed is the same one that come in this generation pulled back the seals and showed what Satan's been doing and saying woman thou art loosed thou now we see the same God that was back in the book of Acts now we see the same are are you understanding now the book was was was was amen was sealed up with man's interpretations and opinions don't sit in this church and just let our this preaching let the preacher preach and it's and and it's just going through the filter of a man's interpretation we we got to go back there's a real thinking man's filter and that's the faith of God to believe every word that's the real thinking man can you say Amen not just an intellectual giant but a real man a real woman a real child a oh God come on now a real preacher wend Martin that's got to be somebody say God I believe it the way you said it a real believer can you say amen amen yes he Health the broken in heart and he Minds their wounds and amen hallelujah that old forgiving unforgiving attitude Hallelujah that old unforgiving spirit that well praise the Lord amen and and and and and you know many of times unforgiveness well most of the time unforgiveness comes from a wounded Spirit man we've been hurt by even if it's not from this person right here it might be from you know someone way back in your in your past and and and because of of of something that happened amen it's just it's just like brother brandom talked about the the the nervous woman that had came and remember that the nervous woman and she had just he had been she was so nervous and in going to the insan Asylum and and and and in discernment he says well what started this is there was a dog that chased you when you was a little girl and it scared you it it it it it's and it's made you a nervous person from that time forward well when the discernment of the word can come and go back to the root of the problem we not necessarily that we got a prophet up here Discerning we can take that word and go back to the root of the situation and that root of the situation says you can be free right there and you hear those words woman thou art loosed amen can you say amen amen you see then you can you can do that but now listen amen if the woman's husband a man there in Romans 7 and 2 says for the woman which as the husband is bound by law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the woman if but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband oh can you say man what I'm what I'm trying to say is what has taken place here today is there's been a death and there's been a marriage yeah there's been a death and there's been a marriage there's been a de God's taken me amen an old worthless Gentile amen married to my first nature that a that that that sin nature that that unforgiving nature but hallelujah amen that old man has died and now I've raised a new I'm married to Jesus Christ The Living Word oh can you say Amen oh yes now it's no longer I that lives but it's Christ that lives in me it's by his power I have nothing I can give I I have nothing I can offer hallelujah amen like the blind man that that was healed by Jesus and the those old stinking preachers now they're going to go find out what's going on Amen and those preachers are all mad and they're going over there to to to to his parents and saying hey what happened to him why why does he see who who done this to him and they were scared because they they knew that if they said Jesus done it amen then then uh uh they would get kicked out of the synagogue I mean Jesus was tearing all the churches up Hallelujah and and so they they says hey he's of age ask him amen and they come over to him and they say hallelujah do do who who who who done this to you and by what power he said what Jesus Jesus of Nazareth done this to me what power did he use and he says I don't know all I know is this one he says aren't and he actually tells them aren't you the preachers aren't you supposed to know this he says all I can tell you is this I was once blind and now I can see the power of life in the son of man has set me hallelujah oh the power of life it couldn't come from a church it couldn't come from Mama it couldn't come from Daddy it couldn't come from that preacher or that pre well praise the Lord I'm here to tell you there's a lot of Cults inside the message Church there's a lot of denominations that are attached but it is not the message this message is pure this message is unadulterated this message will never denominate amen we are under the authority of the son of man I am not following any man I'm following Jesus Christ the revealed word amen the revealed word has Set Me Free amen praise the Lord perfect strength perfect weakness brother brandom says and then God took Paul and made a slave out of him bound him to himself now this is where I was going at the very beginning he has cut you loose from the power of darkness and now put you under the authority of the power of light he says bound him to himself sent him to the Gentiles which he hated but you see he had to be loosed from his Eccles I astical powers in order to be bound to the power of God he had to lose his strength and become weak and nothing in order to receive the strength of God to be bound to God to do what God would tell him to do and that's what we need today that's what I need today that's what every man needs today is a loss of himself loss of his ability loss of what he is that he might come have a complete yielding to the Holy Spirit Housewives need that school boys need that even our little children can you say Amen aren't you glad for that Hallelujah woman those are the greatest words that can ever be spoke by a son of man by the son of man woman thou art loosed Hallelujah you say now you keep going back to the son of man son of man son of man aren't we under the son of man he says there was the three names Jesus had three of them coming there was the son of God there was the son of man Jesus on Earth Son of God the Holy Ghost rang through the church the there's the son of David but he promised right before the Millennium when the son of David is going to Reign God would come back as son of man why the son of man word made flesh Spirit spoken words the same words that said Mary you're going to produce a child yeah the same words said a virgin bride shall come forth the same words that says I no longer call you church but I call you brianl woman I'm separating you calling you out of the denominational Cycles woman remember brother branom having the having the the the dream of the of of of woman that was supposed to been his his his mother and a man that was supposed to be his dad and he's grabbed her by the hair of the head and he's got the three cornered stick and he's and he's beating beating up pop out of her leave her laying on the floor and then he'd get up and walk around strut of stuff just all proud of himself and when the woman would begin to get back up come to herself and try to get back up he'd go back over and grab her again brother bram's looking and says he's my father I can't he's strong I ain't got nothing I can do and he's looking and then the then the light appears and says deliver some something along that that line that that effect and as he stood up to the man all of a sudden his muscles begin to grow the man looking at him who are you and he's looking there he says I said leave her alone and brother brandom's muscles begin to grow and the man begin to shrink and and more stronger he stood up against him and he comes out of it Hallelujah she had been beat down been beat down beat down by the trinitarian dogmas been beat down by man's opinion been beat down by she'd been manhandled for so long for so long for so long but it took a prophet that would stand there in the midst of it all and say you guys are wrong it took a prophet to stand there in the midst of in the midst of it all when he could have had all of the money when he could have had all of these things and he stood up against the system come he stood up against it and said let her alone leave her alone he stood up against the system he had the faith muscles there to stand and the man had to back off and leave her alone it was a son of man that was coming down in this generation to claim you and tell you who you are woman you're loosed you're free bless the Lord the musicians would come Hallelujah many times we're we're we're born we man thinking of a prayer line brother bradam would talk he says come on brother of course I know you and know that you're nervous but let this be the night it's over will you yes sir God be merciful to my dear brother knowing this nerous nervousness was born in him from his mother and father before him knowing his knowing his poor mother being a nervous woman and here he has suffered all his life but may this be the night we know Lord that nothing short of a miracle will ever heal the boy heal the man and I pray God that if he's staggered and tried and bursted in and trying his best to get Faith I pray God that you'll somehow move back and accept the little faith that he has and perform a miracle to healing and may He return to his home and get well in Christ jesus' name amen that wasn't hereditary thing you've been nervous all your life your mother was before you was nervous now you go and just beginning to thank God I believe God has healed you tonight my brother you won't have to do it can you say Amen
