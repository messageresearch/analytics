[18:42] Darkness filled the
[18:45] sky the
[18:49] day
[18:52] in the bitter
[18:57] cross. They took his body
[19:01] down and laid in a
[19:05] tomb. His friends believe that
[19:09] everything
[19:17] was the darkness turned to light.
[19:22] For Mary heard her
[19:25] name and saw the living
[19:30] Christ
[19:33] ris to set the captives free. Oh, he's
[19:39] [Music]

[20:14] The world forever changed.
[20:17] For hope was born when Jesus rose that
[20:22] day.
[20:24] [Music]
[20:25] and still his wounded
[20:28] heads. Reveal the love he
[20:32] had for every fallen soul he came to
[20:37] save.
[20:39] [Music]
[20:41] And he will come
[20:44] again. And one by one we'll
[20:48] rise to praise his holy
[20:52] name and see the living
[20:56] Christ.
[20:59] Ris to set the captives free. Oh, he is
[21:07] ris to vansom you and
[21:11] me to bind up every broken heart to
[21:16] conquer death and
[21:19] sing.
[21:22] Ris to bring us
[21:26] home again.
[21:33] [Music]
[21:35] And in that barren
[21:38] place, the world forever
[21:42] changed. For hope was born when Jesus
[21:46] rose that day.
[21:51] And still his wounded
[21:54] hands. Reveal the love he
[21:57] has for every fallen soul he came to
[22:02] save.
[22:06] Then he will come
[22:09] again and one by one we'll

[22:21] Christ.
[22:24] Ris to set the captives free. Oh, he is

[38:47] Lord. He is exalted. He's worthy to be
[38:52] exalted. Amen. And I What can we say
[38:56] about that special from those
[39:00] kids, the
[39:02] children? Amen. Wow. That was wonderful.
[39:06] And then those sisters. Amen. I tell
[39:10] you, um, both of those songs were just
[39:14] phenomenal. And I know the Lord was
[39:17] pleased. And I tell you, just feeling
[39:19] the presence of the Lord in in those in
[39:22] those songs were just wonderful, wasn't
[39:24] it? Amen. Wow. That's just that's just
[39:27] wonderful. I I wanted to come out here
[39:29] and just start rejoicing. Praise the
[39:31] Lord. And um so we're we're glad to be
[39:35] back in the house of the Lord tonight.
[39:36] Good to good to see everyone that has
[39:39] come back and looking forward to uh what
[39:42] God has in store for us this evening.
[39:44] We're going to um look here in the book
[39:47] of Hebrews, the first chapter. And um we
[39:51] we don't want to keep you as long as we
[39:54] did this morning.
[39:58] Um but I am glad for Easter. Aren't you
[40:00] glad for Easter and what Easter
[40:03] represents to uh to each of us? Praise
[40:06] the Lord. And um want to say that we
[40:09] really enjoyed lunch today. And uh my
[40:13] that was that was just wonderful. And uh
[40:17] we're so blessed to have lunch as much
[40:19] as we do around here. And uh we we just
[40:23] say God richly bless you you sisters.
[40:26] Praise the Lord.
[40:28] Um I am we want to read here in Hebrews
[40:31] 1 and
[40:33] one. It says God who at sunundry times
[40:36] and in diverse manners spake in times
[40:40] past unto your fathers by the prophets
[40:42] and hath in these last days spoken unto
[40:45] us by his son whom he hath appointed
[40:49] heir of all things. Now this is so
[40:52] important
[40:54] because Jesus the man has been exalted.
[41:00] God has always been exalted. God has
[41:03] always been God. But the Jesus is the
[41:08] first of the human
[41:10] race to be exalted and to be appointed
[41:15] heir of all things. What Christ done as
[41:20] a man to to uh give us our inheritance
[41:26] is a wonderful thing. Whom he hath
[41:28] appointed heir of all things, by whom
[41:31] also he made the worlds. who being the
[41:34] brightness of his glory in the express
[41:36] image of his person, upholding all
[41:38] things by the word of his power, when he
[41:40] had purged him uh him when he had by
[41:44] himself purged our sins, sat down on the
[41:48] right hand of the
[41:50] majesty on high. Let's go to the Lord in
[41:53] prayer. Father, we want to thank you
[41:55] today for your many blessings you have
[41:58] given
[41:59] us. And we thank you today, Lord, for uh
[42:03] what this what this day represents and
[42:06] what it meant to us, Lord, for all of of
[42:10] your your elect. And Father, we thank
[42:13] you for that first Easter morning. And
[42:16] we thank you for the life of God today.
[42:19] We thank you for what it means. And I
[42:21] pray, Lord, tonight that you would just
[42:23] be with us as we lift your name. that
[42:26] you would anoint me, Lord, to say only
[42:28] as you would want me to say, Lord. I
[42:31] pray, Lord, that you would you would
[42:33] just be pleased that in everything that
[42:36] is done and said tonight, in Jesus name
[42:39] we pray. Can the church say amen? And
[42:42] amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[42:46] I I want to minister here this evening
[42:50] just a on a short text the
[42:54] ascension of Christ and his
[42:57] bride. Amen. The ascension of Christ and
[43:01] his bride. Now remembering from this
[43:04] morning the purpose of man Amen was
[43:08] fellowship and authority. God gave, he
[43:12] created man in his own image so that he
[43:16] could have fellowship with that man. He
[43:20] couldn't have God couldn't have
[43:21] fellowship with with any other creature.
[43:24] God couldn't have fellowship with with
[43:27] uh the animal life, the plant life. He
[43:30] couldn't have fellowship with the
[43:32] planets. God created man in his image so
[43:38] that he could fellowship with him and
[43:41] that he could share his authority with.
[43:46] Now I I I I I want us to really catch
[43:49] that. Amen.
[43:51] Christianity is
[43:53] redemption. Amen. Fellowship so that God
[43:58] can share his authority with us.
[44:03] Now, amen. I if we then of course the
[44:06] fall, Amen. the fellowship was broken.
[44:09] The authority was lost. Now, when we
[44:13] when we look there at Calvary and what
[44:16] Calvary meant to us, amen, brother
[44:19] Brandham would put it this way in the
[44:21] mighty God unveiled in ' 64. He said,
[44:24] "The real genuine lamb of God hanging in
[44:27] plain view on Calvary, the real mercy
[44:30] seat." when God had paid the price
[44:33] himself became one of us and had
[44:36] manifested himself as a man to get
[44:40] acquainted with us and ma that we to be
[44:45] acquainted with him. So the the reason
[44:50] for for this to take place again was for
[44:54] God to get acquainted with us and we get
[44:59] acquainted with him.
[45:02] God had to come down in a body in order
[45:07] to pay the price of
[45:09] redemption with the thought in mind with
[45:13] the full intention of mind for
[45:16] fellowship and dominion. So we would be
[45:20] restored back to that position that Adam
[45:24] was as a man.
[45:27] Now, God created man in a body because
[45:31] God had a plan for Adam here on this
[45:35] earth. And I want to say God's still got
[45:37] a plan for you here on this earth. And
[45:40] if we get our thoughts on heaven and and
[45:43] the great by and by and the power and
[45:45] the great by and by and the glory and
[45:47] the great buy and buy, Amen. then what
[45:50] are we fulfilling? And what purpose are
[45:52] we fulfilling here? We've got a purpose
[45:55] for being here right now. We've got a
[45:59] purpose for that. And so God came, God
[46:03] created Adam. Amen. So that the
[46:06] invisible God would have a body to live
[46:09] in. And Adam had the authority. Adam
[46:12] could he could he could travel with the
[46:15] speed of thought. Adam could speak to
[46:17] the trees to move. Amen. A tree to be
[46:20] moved over. He could speak to the winds.
[46:23] Adam could speak to the lions. He could
[46:25] Adam had control. The authority was with
[46:28] him. Amen. Adam while on earth ruled
[46:34] from the heavens.
[46:38] Adam while on earth ruled in a heavenly
[46:43] realm. He didn't rule from his mind. He
[46:45] didn't rule from his five senses. He
[46:48] ruled through that supernatural sense of
[46:51] faith. And that's what made man so
[46:54] powerful. But it was when the sin came,
[46:57] the soul was shut up to faith. And now
[47:00] he is just as weak as any as as any of
[47:04] the other creatures. And he's now
[47:06] subject to the law of sin and death. But
[47:10] when Christ came, as we just read, Amen.
[47:13] he hath been appointed heir again of all
[47:19] things.
[47:21] A man has been appointed
[47:25] heir once more to all things and he is
[47:30] sitting down. Well, I I I that just
[47:32] makes me want to shout. When he had
[47:34] conquered and ascended and sat down.
[47:38] Now, if you you know, we read this this
[47:40] morning, so I'm going to read it to you
[47:41] again. Hebrews 10:12, but this man, it
[47:45] didn't say this God, it said this man
[47:49] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[47:53] sins forever, sat down on the right hand
[47:57] of God, from henceforth, expecting till
[48:00] his enemies be made his foottool. For by
[48:04] one offering, somebody say one offering,
[48:06] he hath perfected
[48:10] forever them that are sanctified.
[48:14] Whereof the Holy Ghost also was a
[48:15] witness to us. For after that he said
[48:18] before, this is the covenant I will make
[48:21] with them after those days I will put my
[48:23] laws into their hearts and in their
[48:25] minds will I write them. Amen. So, so
[48:29] now I I I I I want you to understand
[48:32] Christ the man is seated in the heavenly
[48:37] places. That position means everything
[48:41] to you that are still here on this
[48:44] earth. There is a man who is there in
[48:49] the heavens that is heir of all things.
[48:53] Well, that should make you want to
[48:55] shout. You see now what does what are
[48:58] you trying to say? You keep talking
[49:00] about this man. Amen. Because that man
[49:04] is the is the head of the human race.
[49:08] Amen. That man is now representing you
[49:13] like Adam represented you and sold you
[49:16] out. Adam sold you out. Adam because of
[49:21] some lust. Amen. uh uh uh for for for uh
[49:25] you know after the fruit and and and his
[49:28] desires and he went after it and he says
[49:33] to heck with the race. Amen. I'm going
[49:35] after my wife. Followed his wife. Now
[49:38] that's just that's just Amen. That's
[49:40] paraphrasing there. He when he
[49:44] ptook of the through disobedience he
[49:47] ptook of that fruit that was forbidden.
[49:51] He sowed every one of you out. You
[49:53] didn't eat of that tree, but you were
[49:55] born because of that tree. You are
[49:58] sinful because of that tree. Your your
[50:00] grandma dies because of that tree. Your
[50:02] grandpa, you're going to die if the Lord
[50:04] dares if because of that tree. One man
[50:09] represented you.
[50:13] Oh, glory to God. But then God had
[50:16] another man of his
[50:18] race and he is representing you tonight.
[50:22] Amen. And he is representing glory. He
[50:25] is representing heaven. He is
[50:27] representing authority. He is the heir.
[50:31] Adam lost it. Adam was once heir of all
[50:34] things. Adam was he had the authority.
[50:37] Adam lost it. But the second man Adam
[50:40] has now the possession of all things.
[50:43] And through his blood, he has brought
[50:47] you back into those heavenly places. You
[50:50] say, "Well, when I get to heaven, I'll
[50:52] have authority." A Adam wasn't in heaven
[50:55] when he had authority. He was in this on
[50:57] this earth when he had authority. And
[50:59] God has given you authority while here
[51:04] on this earth.
[51:10] That's why uh Ephesians 1 uh 16, Sister
[51:14] Cle, would you put that up there? Amen.
[51:16] I don't have it here, but I think it's
[51:17] 11:16, 11:17. That's why the Apostle
[51:20] Paul, Ephesians uh 1:70, he says, "I
[51:23] cease not to give thanks for you, making
[51:25] mention of you in my prayers, that the
[51:27] God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
[51:31] of glory, may give unto you the spirit
[51:35] of wisdom and revelation and the
[51:38] knowledge of him." I want you to catch.
[51:40] I want you to understand. I I'm praying
[51:42] with all that I've got that God will
[51:45] give you wisdom and revelation of this
[51:48] understanding. Amen. The next verse he
[51:51] says uh uh 18th
[51:53] verse, praise the Lord, that the eyes of
[51:57] your understanding being enlightened
[51:59] that you may know what is the hope of
[52:03] his calling and what the riches of the
[52:06] glory of his inheritance in the saints.
[52:11] And what is the exceeding greatness of
[52:13] his power to usward who believe
[52:16] according to the working of his mighty
[52:18] power which he wrought in Christ when he
[52:22] raised him from the dead and set him at
[52:25] his own right hand in the heavenly
[52:27] places. For our above all principality
[52:31] and power and might and dominion and
[52:35] every name that is named not only in
[52:37] this world but also in the world to
[52:39] come. and hath put all things, somebody
[52:43] say all things. Under his feet, this
[52:47] man, this heir, his feet, and gave him
[52:50] to be the head over the church.
[52:54] Adam was once the head and he sold us
[52:57] out, but Christ has been exalted as the
[53:00] head and he's brought us back in.
[53:05] Amen. You say now, "Well, the
[53:08] resurrection is wonderful." Brother
[53:10] Brandham would say, "Amen." Brother
[53:12] Brandham would say this, he he would
[53:14] say, "Amen. If if I can if I can find it
[53:18] here." Amen. He says, "His precious soul
[53:21] descended into hell where I ought to
[53:23] have went." But on the third day, Samson
[53:26] taking now, he says, "Now Samson taking
[53:28] the gate of the city on his back had
[53:31] nothing to do with this. He took the
[53:32] gates of hell, the gates of the grave,
[53:35] and everything else. He didn't pack it
[53:37] up on a mountain, but he destroyed it.
[53:39] Hallelujah. Possessed the gate of the
[53:41] enemy, the atmospheres that was filled
[53:45] with the devil's power above and the
[53:47] angels or or thing could come down. He
[53:50] says there could be uh there could not
[53:52] be no intercession because the blood of
[53:54] goats would not take away sin but his
[53:57] own blood took away sin and he ascended
[54:00] on high led captive captive and he gave
[54:04] gifts unto men. Now he says now he says
[54:08] his earthly work was finished at the
[54:10] resurrection. He proved everything that
[54:12] he said but now he's got another work to
[54:16] do that the world knows little about.
[54:19] That's right. The next work is his
[54:21] ascension. So he says it's good thing
[54:24] for him to come and and and and to be
[54:26] resurrected and his disciples to see
[54:29] him. Amen. And everyone to know that
[54:33] this indeed was the one that God had had
[54:38] accepted a as as the atoning sacrifice
[54:42] for man. But he says he could not just
[54:47] sit there. Amen. on uh on a rock
[54:50] somewhere and say, "My work is
[54:52] finished." Because we needed a man that
[54:58] could go back into those heavenly realms
[55:01] to represent the fallen race. Well,
[55:06] praise the Lord. Did you know you have a
[55:08] man? You have a man in heaven that is
[55:11] representing you. You have a man in
[55:14] heaven that knows all about your sins,
[55:16] knows all about your sickness, knows all
[55:18] about your troubles, knows all about
[55:21] depression, knows all about headaches,
[55:23] knows all about Amen. uh being tempted
[55:26] of the devil. There is a man who is heir
[55:30] of all things, who has been tempted just
[55:34] like you are. And he's been in the
[55:38] heavens. Well, that you should shout
[55:40] hallelujah.
[55:41] He says, "Now his next work is his
[55:43] ascension." We want to speak on that for
[55:44] a moment. Now, he after he's risen from
[55:47] the dead, after he's already here on the
[55:49] earth, proven himself alive by
[55:52] infallible proofs that that he's doing
[55:54] the same thing that he did here uh when
[55:56] he was here in flesh. Here he is
[55:58] walking, breaking bread, eating with
[56:00] them. Now, the ascension comes, the time
[56:03] comes. Did you ever know the Bible said
[56:05] that he ascended up so far above every
[56:09] through every heaven? The earth belonged
[56:11] to the devil. Through the fall, this
[56:13] earth was given to the devil. Every
[56:15] kingdom of this world is governed by the
[56:18] devil. We hate to think that, but the
[56:20] but the Bible says it is. That's the
[56:23] reason we have wars and shooting and
[56:25] fighting and trouble is because the
[56:27] kingdoms of this world is the kingdoms
[56:29] of the devil. The Bible said so. And in
[56:32] the great millennium which is to come,
[56:34] the Bible said, "Rejoice all ye heavens
[56:35] and you holy prophets of the earth. For
[56:37] the kingdoms of this earth have become
[56:40] the kingdoms of our Lord, and he shall
[56:42] rule and reign forever." Now, now they
[56:45] will become, see, we'll have no more
[56:47] war. Then when he comes, no more
[56:50] sickness, no more trouble. But now
[56:52] notice, there is little said folk about
[56:56] this ascension. If it's one of those one
[56:58] of the greatest days when he ascended up
[57:01] cause all over the earth since the days
[57:04] in the garden of Eden that sin was
[57:07] committed the heavens was shut off from
[57:10] mankind. Satan is the prince of the
[57:13] power of the air. That's right. Why art
[57:16] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer? No
[57:18] man could see into glory. No man could
[57:21] understand because the power is just
[57:23] above us. Heaven means atmosphere above.
[57:26] Then all of these powers was shut off
[57:29] from mankind because of sin. But when he
[57:33] died and had rose, come up, the Bible
[57:37] said, "No one has ascended up but he
[57:39] that had came down first." When he was
[57:41] in heaven, he was the logos that went
[57:43] out of God in the beginning. And he come
[57:45] down on earth and was not uh to be made
[57:49] an angel. He came down on the earth and
[57:52] took the form of a bondsman. not of an
[57:54] angel. Not not come down in the great
[57:57] Jehovah glory. He came down as a man to
[58:01] redeem man to die for man to die as a
[58:05] man. He never died as God. He died as a
[58:10] man. The sin of man was upon the son of
[58:14] man. And he had to become a man in order
[58:16] to pay the penalty. Well, doesn't that
[58:19] just make you want to rejoice?
[58:21] What's the purpose? Now, catch this
[58:23] because I love the way brother Brandham
[58:25] brings us out. There's a purpose. He's
[58:28] wanting to take you back into heavenly
[58:31] places. Did you know the Apostle Paul
[58:33] says, "You are now seated in
[58:38] the same places that Adam was once
[58:40] seated in." Can you say, "Amen."
[58:44] Amen. He says, "What did he do?" Well,
[58:46] the Bible said he was he was made a
[58:48] little lower than the angels in order
[58:50] for death that he might take away and
[58:52] abolish sin and take away sickness from
[58:54] the world. And when he come down from
[58:56] the highest logos from God, he come down
[58:59] through the angels and come on down and
[59:01] made a man. And he said, "I'm not even a
[59:04] man. I'm a worm and no man." He was
[59:06] despised and rejected. I think the
[59:09] greatest scriptures that that's more
[59:12] neglected than any scripture that I know
[59:14] of being preached on is the ascension of
[59:16] the Lord Jesus. What he did after his
[59:20] resurrection, he did not sit down on the
[59:23] tomb after his resurrection because his
[59:25] work was not finished. It wasn't
[59:28] finished. And the ones at the grave the
[59:30] morning were forbidden to even touch
[59:31] him. But that night they were bidden to
[59:34] come and feel his hands. And he forbid
[59:36] his mother to touch him. I've not yet
[59:38] ascended into my father, my God, and
[59:41] yours. He had not. He would only be
[59:43] ready to to do his great priest work at
[59:46] that time. He had he had just been
[59:48] anointed. And when he was here on the
[59:50] earth, he lived a life, made himself
[59:52] lower than the angels in order to take
[59:54] away sin. Just think, that's who he was.
[59:58] He was the logos that came down from God
[1:00:00] in the beginning. He was the word of
[1:00:02] God. He was the angel of God that was
[1:00:04] with the children of Israel in the
[1:00:06] wilderness. He was the great
[1:00:07] supernatural of the heaven. None other
[1:00:10] than Jehovah himself. Came down here on
[1:00:13] the earth. Became a man. Not only a man
[1:00:18] but become the servant of man. Took upon
[1:00:22] himself uh and make of of no reputation
[1:00:25] but became a footwasher. Can you say
[1:00:29] amen? Says he went to the lowest in the
[1:00:31] city and the of the city of the world
[1:00:33] Jericho. so low till the smallest man in
[1:00:35] the city had to climb up in a tree to
[1:00:37] look down at him. And God has raised him
[1:00:40] up and given put him so high above every
[1:00:43] heaven until he has stooped over look at
[1:00:46] heaven.
[1:00:49] Now as we said we are seated with Christ
[1:00:55] in heavenly places.
[1:00:58] This is a a point of it's a
[1:01:03] representation. It's a
[1:01:05] representative. We have people we have
[1:01:08] we elect our congressmen in our in our
[1:01:12] congresses, our state our state house.
[1:01:14] Amen. To represent us. So they represent
[1:01:18] uh the districts here in Oklahoma. We
[1:01:20] have we have representatives from
[1:01:22] Oklahoma that represents us up there in
[1:01:25] Washington. Some of them are are
[1:01:27] scoundrels. Most probably are. Amen. And
[1:01:32] but and they're in they're in it for
[1:01:34] whatever money they can make and deals
[1:01:36] and things they can do. Amen. So Jesus,
[1:01:39] but they are representatives of us. So
[1:01:42] Jesus is a representative of God's
[1:01:45] elect. He's God's representative. He's
[1:01:48] representing you.
[1:01:50] That's why when you pray, you pray in
[1:01:52] Jesus name.
[1:01:54] That's why everything we do, we do in
[1:01:57] Jesus' name because he is our
[1:01:59] representative there. So when you come
[1:02:01] to God and you ask, you ask in his name.
[1:02:05] He is God's
[1:02:07] representative. He's the one that has
[1:02:10] fallen error. He's the one that paid the
[1:02:13] price. And he is your representation
[1:02:17] there in the heavens. Well, that should
[1:02:18] make you want to shout. And he is higher
[1:02:22] than death. He is higher than cancer. He
[1:02:26] is higher. So when we come to God and
[1:02:29] praying for the cancer to be healed in
[1:02:33] his name, there is
[1:02:35] one there is a human that knows what the
[1:02:40] feeling is like. They know what the He
[1:02:43] knows what the pain is like and he's
[1:02:46] there as an intercession. He is there as
[1:02:48] a representative for your prayer before
[1:02:52] God.
[1:02:56] There's a lot of guys that's
[1:02:58] representing us in our in our state and
[1:03:01] federal offices that know nothing about
[1:03:03] the little guy. They were born with a
[1:03:06] silver spoon in their mouth and they're
[1:03:08] there just making deals and they don't
[1:03:10] know anything about us poor dudes. But
[1:03:13] Christ come. Yeah,
[1:03:16] Christ come. Jesus has suffered. Jesus
[1:03:21] was a teenager. Jesus was those was one
[1:03:24] of those that knows where we're at. Can
[1:03:26] you say amen? Amen. He says, "And now he
[1:03:31] he was then had his own blood as a high
[1:03:34] priest and he went beyond the veils
[1:03:37] through every sphere. Satan in the times
[1:03:39] past had men blocked off from heaven.
[1:03:43] could not come in contact with heaven.
[1:03:45] But when Jesus took his blood, the first
[1:03:48] veil he rent was the veil of death and
[1:03:51] the veil of the grave and the veil of
[1:03:53] the temple and the veil of sickness and
[1:03:55] the veil of fear and every veil there
[1:03:58] was that and unveiled God to men. And he
[1:04:01] went way in above the heavens of heaven
[1:04:04] and was seated on the right hand of God
[1:04:07] and sat down as a finished work above
[1:04:10] all. And there he opened up a channel
[1:04:14] that God used to come down through the
[1:04:16] quarters of heaven to talk to mankind in
[1:04:20] the Garden of Eden. And Satan by sin had
[1:04:23] blocked it off. But now the great high
[1:04:25] priest with his anointing, with his
[1:04:27] blood, went through every veil ripped
[1:04:30] her open and cleared out the skies again
[1:04:34] that God and man could be father and son
[1:04:38] and commune again with one another.
[1:04:44] This ain't this this this is not just a
[1:04:46] figment of our imagination, friends.
[1:04:48] That's the reason why I say I I I'm
[1:04:51] always say if there's no life in your
[1:04:53] worship man then then maybe you've not
[1:04:56] come in contact with the living God. You
[1:04:58] come in contact with the living God.
[1:05:01] It's not a formal thing at all. You have
[1:05:04] you have come in contact the living God
[1:05:09] and you heaven and earth has
[1:05:12] embraced. You know him. He knows you.
[1:05:18] This
[1:05:19] resurrection has opened up the
[1:05:23] heavens. The impossibilities have become
[1:05:27] possible. If y'all want to if if that we
[1:05:30] might still have the heat on y'all if if
[1:05:32] if it needs to be the AC turned on. I
[1:05:34] see people
[1:05:35] fanning. But if if the I above it all,
[1:05:41] Jesus paid the price. come up to give us
[1:05:47] the redemption of his of his blood. Can
[1:05:50] you say amen?
[1:05:52] Amen. Well, praise the Lord. You see,
[1:05:55] what does this mean, brother Wendle?
[1:05:56] What what what does Well, you remember
[1:06:00] and I and I've given this I I I I I've
[1:06:04] talked about this in the in the times
[1:06:07] past. You remember when Jesus said,
[1:06:10] "Amen, there in John 14, I'm the way and
[1:06:13] I'm the life and I go to prepare a place
[1:06:16] for you." Now, now, Brother Brandham
[1:06:19] says, "Now, there's going to be there
[1:06:20] there's there there's there there's a
[1:06:22] real heaven over there, but he uses this
[1:06:25] scripture. I go to prepare a place for
[1:06:27] you that where I am, you can be also.
[1:06:33] I'm going to the throne and through me
[1:06:37] you're going now now you're still going
[1:06:38] to be here on this earth but you're
[1:06:40] going to be able to kneel down in prayer
[1:06:43] and break through all of those rims of
[1:06:45] the enemy that's trying to tell you
[1:06:46] you're unworthy trying to tell you
[1:06:49] you'll never be and God God can't save
[1:06:52] your children and God can't heal your
[1:06:54] body. You have a right to come and bow
[1:06:58] down before your knee. Those that base
[1:07:01] themselves shall be exalted.
[1:07:05] Can you say amen? Where I am, you may be
[1:07:11] also. I'm clearing away through the
[1:07:14] heavens through my blood. I am seated
[1:07:18] physically in those heavens representing
[1:07:21] you.
[1:07:24] Oh, won't you put that in your pipe and
[1:07:26] smoke it, devil?
[1:07:28] I've got a representative in the heavens
[1:07:31] that's representing me.
[1:07:36] You as a believer should expect the same
[1:07:38] thing.
[1:07:40] Why? Why did Jesus says, "If you can
[1:07:43] believe it, if you can believe it, you
[1:07:47] can say to this mountain, be
[1:07:51] removed and cast into the sea." Well,
[1:07:55] praise the Lord. Wow.
[1:07:58] Because with this
[1:08:00] ascension comes the
[1:08:03] restoration price paid. God honored the
[1:08:06] sacrifice by raising it up. He is now
[1:08:10] exalted as a
[1:08:13] human in the heavens.
[1:08:18] Oh, brother window. Can it be can can it
[1:08:20] can it be that that that
[1:08:24] we that that us humans we have to wait
[1:08:27] till we get to heaven that's not the way
[1:08:29] Jesus done it Jesus says I do nothing
[1:08:32] except my father first show me there was
[1:08:33] an open communication between him and
[1:08:35] God how how about how about the h how
[1:08:38] about Jesus you know when he was talking
[1:08:41] to the that the centurion they're there
[1:08:43] they're in
[1:08:44] compernium you know Jesus had controlled
[1:08:47] the winds and the waves and had the
[1:08:49] authority. Jesus was was speaking and
[1:08:53] and the men would look at him, the
[1:08:55] disciples would say, they marvel and
[1:08:57] said, "What manner of man is
[1:09:00] this?" For with words, his words have
[1:09:04] pack authority and
[1:09:06] power. He was in a boat. He was on a
[1:09:11] boat in the middle of a storm. He spoke
[1:09:15] the words and the winds obeyed. So much
[1:09:20] that the disciples said, "What manner of
[1:09:23] men is man is this that even the winds
[1:09:26] and the waves obey him?"
[1:09:31] Jesus had an authority
[1:09:37] that even the prince of the powers of
[1:09:40] the air that were trying to kill
[1:09:44] him that caused the waves, Jesus stood
[1:09:47] up and those demons had to stop. Well, I
[1:09:52] just want to shout
[1:09:54] Jesus going to the grave. a man of
[1:09:57] Lazarus. He wept like a man, but as God,
[1:10:00] he stood and said, "Lazarus, come
[1:10:03] forth."
[1:10:05] Wherever those wherever Lazarus was at,
[1:10:08] he was already four days gone.
[1:10:13] Well, the demons, death, the grave, all
[1:10:18] of them had to give them up. Give up.
[1:10:20] All of those devils had to give up
[1:10:23] Lazarus because a man in his position
[1:10:28] stood there. Amen. Under the commission
[1:10:31] of God. And those spirits in the
[1:10:34] heavenly places knew who that man was.
[1:10:42] Oh, that should Oh, glory to. Can you
[1:10:44] say amen? Blind saw, the deaf heard.
[1:10:48] Amen. the lame walk. What was it? God
[1:10:51] was in with was with him. Amen. Doing
[1:10:55] those good works. But now we find that
[1:10:58] there in and I'm not going to hold you
[1:10:59] too much longer tonight. So I want you
[1:11:01] to stay with me here. Amen. We find that
[1:11:04] when Jesus was was was come to Capernaum
[1:11:08] there in in Matthew 8 and5 when Jesus
[1:11:12] was entered into Capernium there came
[1:11:14] unto him a centurion beseeching him
[1:11:17] saying Lord my servant lith at home sick
[1:11:21] of the Pauly which is he's paralyzed and
[1:11:24] grieviously tormented and Jesus said
[1:11:27] unto him I will come and heal
[1:11:33] Huh? Wouldn't you just love to hear
[1:11:35] those words? I will come and heal
[1:11:39] him. But watch what the centurion says.
[1:11:42] The centurion answered and says, Lord,
[1:11:45] I'm not worthy that thou should come
[1:11:48] under my
[1:11:53] roof. But I've heard what happened to
[1:11:56] Lazarus. I've heard what happened to
[1:11:58] that storm on the sea.
[1:12:01] I've heard I've been watching you around
[1:12:03] here there that you have a control that
[1:12:07] is greater than anything around here.
[1:12:11] I'm a centurion. I'm a great man. I tell
[1:12:14] my servants to do whatever and they do
[1:12:17] it. I'm watching you and I'm saying you
[1:12:21] have an authority and devils have to
[1:12:24] listen to you.
[1:12:26] Oh, hallelujah. The citrians answered
[1:12:30] and said,"Lord, I'm not worthy that thou
[1:12:33] shouldest come under my roof, but speak
[1:12:35] the word only, and my servant should be
[1:12:39] healed." In other words, I know who you
[1:12:43] are. Speak that word. If you can control
[1:12:47] the heavenly atmospheres, that means
[1:12:49] you're a God man. You are known in those
[1:12:53] heavenly atmospheres. There is no man
[1:12:56] that has ever been able to do that. I've
[1:12:58] been watching you and you can speak the
[1:13:01] word to my servant and those devils will
[1:13:06] have to let go of that servant and he
[1:13:09] will live. Oh, can you say amen? Amen.
[1:13:13] Why? Because he was not just a mortal
[1:13:16] man. He was a God man. And you have been
[1:13:21] restored back to those heavenly places
[1:13:23] in Christ Jesus. and the authority. Oh
[1:13:27] God, you have a representative in the
[1:13:30] heavens and authority has been given to
[1:13:34] you.
[1:13:37] The ninth
[1:13:38] verse now he just said, "Speak the word
[1:13:41] only. My servant will be healed." Then
[1:13:43] he says, "I'm a man under
[1:13:45] authority. I having soldiers under me. I
[1:13:49] say to this man, go and he goeth. To
[1:13:51] another, come." And he cometh. To my
[1:13:53] servant, do this. and he doeth it. And
[1:13:56] watch Jesus. Everyone else is looking
[1:13:58] for a natural conqueror. Everyone else
[1:14:00] wouldn't accept him for who he was.
[1:14:02] Everyone else couldn't see him. Are you
[1:14:04] hearing me? But this one identified him
[1:14:07] for who he was. And when Jesus heard it,
[1:14:10] he
[1:14:11] marveled and said unto them that
[1:14:13] followed, verily I say unto you, that I
[1:14:17] have not found so great faith, know not
[1:14:21] in Israel.
[1:14:24] I I I I want to
[1:14:26] say that the
[1:14:30] heavens that have always kept the sons
[1:14:34] of God
[1:14:35] down should be should should not be
[1:14:39] there anymore.
[1:14:44] You say, "Brother Wendle, if the heavens
[1:14:47] are open so that I can
[1:14:54] ascend, why does it why why why do I
[1:14:57] have such a hard
[1:15:00] time?"
[1:15:02] Well, we know the hole's been cut. The
[1:15:05] prophet said it
[1:15:06] has. We know that men have come. Had he
[1:15:09] right, had those words
[1:15:13] And it produced power and God gave her
[1:15:16] whatsoever she we
[1:15:18] know that something happened coming down
[1:15:22] to the prophet and he spoke squirrels
[1:15:24] into existence.
[1:15:29] The devil is bluffing his people, God's
[1:15:31] people.
[1:15:33] if he can bluff
[1:15:34] you. And the reason brother
[1:15:38] Brandham hits so hard against
[1:15:41] denominationalism because he says
[1:15:43] denominationalism is the very thing that
[1:15:47] is holding back the sons of God working
[1:15:51] and moving in the
[1:15:54] spirit. The Holy Spirit has been blocked
[1:15:57] by these denominational barriers. But in
[1:16:00] the last day, the message is to release
[1:16:04] it again. God back in human flesh.
[1:16:14] You know what that sounds to me like? Is
[1:16:15] there's going to be some sons that are
[1:16:18] not little children, but it's going to
[1:16:19] be sons who knows the devil's playbook.
[1:16:22] That means there's got to be a
[1:16:25] book that has been sealed up. And no one
[1:16:28] understood what was happening. And they
[1:16:30] thought God didn't love them. And they
[1:16:32] were and they were always in the Molly
[1:16:33] Grubs and and going through all of these
[1:16:36] and and thinking I I
[1:16:38] will, you know, I'm just the biggest
[1:16:40] flub up and I'm this and I'm that and
[1:16:42] and and and you know, when you're with
[1:16:45] that kind of a mentality, you ain't got
[1:16:47] faith to cast out a devil.
[1:16:53] When the devil's got you convinced that
[1:16:56] you're the sorryest daddy or the
[1:16:58] sorryest mama, when he's got you
[1:17:01] convinced that you're the worst the the
[1:17:04] the the worst member of new
[1:17:06] life. When he you're the
[1:17:09] worst, you're just the scum in the toe
[1:17:12] or something. You know, devil's got you
[1:17:14] thinking
[1:17:17] that's well You're not going to feel
[1:17:21] worthy to rise up and whoop a devil.
[1:17:27] Well, Brother Windle, I'm not worthy.
[1:17:29] Brother Windle, you don't have you
[1:17:31] forgot that the risen
[1:17:34] one, the whole reason that he was risen
[1:17:37] was because his
[1:17:39] sacrifice was found acceptable on your
[1:17:42] account.
[1:17:45] He didn't die for himself. His
[1:17:49] sacrifice was for you
[1:17:52] and your blemishes and your weaknesses
[1:17:56] and your failures.
[1:18:03] God has removed your sins as far as the
[1:18:06] east is from the west so that you can
[1:18:08] rise. And it took the anointed one to
[1:18:11] come in this last day. The
[1:18:14] lamb, the one who gave his life in the
[1:18:18] first place is the one who come and took
[1:18:22] the book and handed it to a man.
[1:18:29] We don't like hearing that. We don't
[1:18:32] like hearing,
[1:18:33] "Oh, y'all just building up a man." The
[1:18:36] Bible says that he took the lamb, ripped
[1:18:40] the or took the book, ripped the seals
[1:18:43] off of that book and handed it to the
[1:18:45] last the seventh church age messenger.
[1:18:52] We talk about a lamb and you and we get
[1:18:53] all get everyone's all looking like a
[1:18:55] like this like this this this two-legged
[1:18:58] lamb is up there with all this wool all
[1:19:00] over his face and it's a man up there.
[1:19:04] It was a man that took the book. Jesus
[1:19:09] Christ, the lamb,
[1:19:12] not the high priest, the man took the
[1:19:16] book. Amen. Are are are you hearing me?
[1:19:18] What what I'm saying is not the eternal
[1:19:20] God. It was the lamb. It was the man. It
[1:19:25] was the God became man. It was the man
[1:19:30] who took the book from the hand of God
[1:19:33] and gave it to a man here on earth.
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:44] Why? Why? Why
[1:19:48] today? Why? Why? Why not? Why not back
[1:19:50] in the fifth age? Why not back in the
[1:19:52] third age? Why today?
[1:19:56] Because this is the
[1:19:57] day of ascension.
[1:20:01] This is the day of rapture.
[1:20:04] Rapture wasn't promised for the first,
[1:20:06] second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth age.
[1:20:08] It was promised for the evening time
[1:20:11] people.
[1:20:17] Hallelujah.
[1:20:20] So the resurrected Savior couldn't just
[1:20:22] stand there. He provided a
[1:20:25] way. Some men have found
[1:20:32] him. Glory to
[1:20:35] God. Well, the miracles we have seen
[1:20:38] through brother Brandham's ministry was
[1:20:40] not just that wasn't wasn't anything
[1:20:42] new. It happened. Some of those things
[1:20:44] happened in the day of Pentecost uh uh
[1:20:47] in in in in the New
[1:20:49] Testament. Amen. We Wigglesworth was
[1:20:52] anointed. Wigglesworth had visions.
[1:20:56] Wigglesworth had had had wonderful
[1:20:58] manifestations. Jack Cole, Brother
[1:21:00] Brandham talked about the the raw faith
[1:21:02] of Jack Cole.
[1:21:05] He talked about Tommy Osborne
[1:21:09] and a and the faith and the miracles
[1:21:11] that were transpire.
[1:21:14] Hallelujah. It would fall on men. But
[1:21:18] God says there's going to be a last day
[1:21:19] bride. And I'm not just rapturing one or
[1:21:22] two. I'm rapturing all of my bride.
[1:21:26] They're not there ain't going to be one
[1:21:28] come up into the heavens. There's not
[1:21:30] going to be maybe three coming up the
[1:21:32] heavens. I'm going to give them such an
[1:21:34] ascension. I'm going to give them supper
[1:21:37] rep such a representation. I'm going to
[1:21:39] give them this book so that they can
[1:21:41] know the powers and the tricks of the
[1:21:44] enemy. So that they can rise above it
[1:21:46] all. I'm going to rise rise above it
[1:21:49] all. I'm going to rise above depression.
[1:21:52] I'm going to rise above discouragement.
[1:21:53] I'm going to rise above religion. I'm
[1:21:55] going to rise above I am going to
[1:21:57] fellowship with Christ.
[1:22:04] Amen. Do you love
[1:22:07] him? With his blood, he went through
[1:22:10] every veil and ripped her open. cleared
[1:22:13] out the skies again that God and man
[1:22:15] could be father and son and could
[1:22:16] commune one with one another again. This
[1:22:19] is a marvelous thing. All the patriarchs
[1:22:22] in the Old Testament as they died for
[1:22:23] instance Stephen when they when they
[1:22:26] were stoning him the veils was was open
[1:22:28] to his precious eyes filled with blood.
[1:22:30] Amen. But he said as he knelt on the
[1:22:32] ground I see heaven opened up and Jesus
[1:22:35] standing on the right hand of the father
[1:22:37] of of God. Can you say amen? He says he
[1:22:41] conquered that grave, but that mess that
[1:22:43] was hanging over the earth.
[1:22:45] Yet with his own blood, vesture dipped
[1:22:48] in blood, he conquered those atmospheres
[1:22:51] above. He cut the fogs of hell from
[1:22:54] place to place until he cut a hole
[1:22:56] through the sky that Adam's lost
[1:22:58] children could pray through to victory.
[1:23:00] He conquered the atmospheres. He
[1:23:02] conquered sin. He conquered death. He
[1:23:04] conquered hell. He rose triumphantly.
[1:23:06] He's and on beyond the moon and stars.
[1:23:07] He went with the Old Testament saints.
[1:23:09] Oh, what a victorious march that must
[1:23:12] have been with the real conqueror. Amen.
[1:23:15] After a while, they come in the side of
[1:23:17] the glorious city and Abraham says to
[1:23:19] Sarah, "Come here, honey." And she gets
[1:23:21] Isaac and comes along. Amen. And Isaac
[1:23:23] gets Jacob. And Jacob gets Joseph. Then
[1:23:26] he says, "That's the city that daddy saw
[1:23:28] whose builder and maker is God. I walked
[1:23:31] about on the earth looking for a city to
[1:23:32] come whose builder and maker was God.
[1:23:34] And now I'm coming near the gates."
[1:23:36] Although the great men that they were,
[1:23:38] they could not conquer. It took it taken
[1:23:41] one to come down to do the conquering.
[1:23:44] Though Abraham conquered difficulties,
[1:23:46] Isaac and Jacob and Joseph, there was
[1:23:48] only one who could conquer sin and that
[1:23:50] was him, the Lord Jesus Christ. And as
[1:23:53] they come into the lights from inside
[1:23:55] the city and the great pearly gates are
[1:23:57] shining, the Jesus in the forefront
[1:23:59] marching on and the angels begin to
[1:24:01] ascend to the top of the buildings and
[1:24:04] and they look coming. The Old Testament
[1:24:06] saints cried out, "Open up ye
[1:24:08] everlasting gates. Be ye open. Let the
[1:24:11] king of glory come in, the mighty
[1:24:13] conqueror." And the angels screamed back
[1:24:16] and said, "Who is this king of glory?"
[1:24:18] And the Old Testament Satan's cried out,
[1:24:20] "The Lord of Hosts mighty in battle."
[1:24:23] And the gates come open and he placed at
[1:24:26] the gate the old rugged cross that every
[1:24:28] man or woman ever comes into that gate
[1:24:31] will have to bow before that cross and
[1:24:33] recognize him as the mighty conqueror.
[1:24:36] As the angels 10,000 times, 10 thousands
[1:24:39] of thousands screamed and shouted and
[1:24:42] praised the Lord as this great mighty
[1:24:45] warrior. He led the captivity captive
[1:24:47] and he gave gifts unto man. Not the ark
[1:24:50] of triumph like Hitler, but in the
[1:24:54] rims of glory.
[1:24:57] Oh, that was the Old Testament rapture,
[1:25:00] but we've got a New Testament rapture
[1:25:02] that's fixing to take place. Are you
[1:25:04] ready for this ascension?
[1:25:07] I'm ready.
[1:25:11] when he
[1:25:12] ascended, all those Old Testament saints
[1:25:15] ascended with
[1:25:17] him. And
[1:25:19] today, the Holy Spirit's not going to be
[1:25:22] here on earth too much
[1:25:24] longer. It's going to be lifted. And
[1:25:27] when he is taken out of the way, you're
[1:25:30] going with him.
[1:25:33] I'm going to rise if the musicians would
[1:25:35] come. Rise.
[1:25:38] Rise above it all. I'm going to
[1:25:42] rise. Going to
[1:25:44] rise. Rise above it all. Going to spread
[1:25:50] my wings and fly away to heaven. I'm
[1:25:55] going to rise above it
[1:25:59] all. I'm going to
[1:26:03] rise.
[1:26:05] Rise. Rise above.
[1:26:08] I've got a
[1:26:10] representative.
[1:26:11] Hallelujah.
[1:26:15] Hallelujah. I'm going to spread my wings
[1:26:19] and fly away to
[1:26:22] heaven. Going to
[1:26:25] rise.
[1:26:27] Yes, I'm going to
[1:26:30] rise. Going to rise. Rise.
[1:26:36] I'm going to rise. Going to
[1:26:41] rise. Rise above it
[1:26:44] all. Going to spread my wings and fly
[1:26:49] away.
[1:26:51] Yes.
[1:26:53] Rise.
[1:26:55] Yes. I'm going to
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] rise. Going to rise.
[1:27:04] I'm going to
[1:27:06] rise. Going to
[1:27:09] rise. Rise above it all. Going to spread
[1:27:14] my wings and fly
[1:27:17] with.
[1:27:21] Oh, you've got a representative
[1:27:25] there. The fullness of the God is back
[1:27:28] into the
[1:27:29] church. Hallelujah. Brother Brenham
[1:27:32] would say there in the seed shall not be
[1:27:35] heir with the shock 65. He says and when
[1:27:37] God began to brood over that earth after
[1:27:40] the fall he brought up an Enoch. He
[1:27:43] brought up an Elijah. He brought up a
[1:27:45] Moses. He brought up prophet after
[1:27:46] prophet trying to restore that image
[1:27:48] again. And finally upon the earth come
[1:27:51] the genuine image of God
[1:27:53] himself which was God the logos made
[1:27:56] flesh and dwelt among us. And watch what
[1:28:00] he says now. That same logos has a part.
[1:28:04] He's got a bride. And the same logos,
[1:28:08] this word cannot be tampered with, is
[1:28:10] brooding over the churches today, trying
[1:28:13] to bring the word back to its fullness,
[1:28:16] the full manifestation. And I want to
[1:28:20] say
[1:28:21] amen to that
[1:28:23] word. Hallelujah. I've got a
[1:28:26] representative. He's seated in heavenly
[1:28:29] places and I'm seated in heavenly
[1:28:32] places because I've got a representative
[1:28:35] there. I've got
[1:28:40] representation. God doesn't see God
[1:28:42] doesn't see my imperfections. I'm
[1:28:44] perfect because the
[1:28:46] lamb paid the penalty and his spirit is
[1:28:51] now representing me. And now when God,
[1:28:53] he might hear my voice, but he sees the
[1:28:58] blood. Well, glory to God. The prophet
[1:29:01] says when when you ask anything, it's
[1:29:03] just like Jesus asking
[1:29:06] it. When you ask anything in his name,
[1:29:10] it's just as Jesus
[1:29:18] himself. I'm telling you, he's got you
[1:29:21] covered.
[1:29:22] He's got you covered here this this
[1:29:24] evening. Can you say amen? Aren't you
[1:29:26] glad for that tonight? Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:29:29] the gloom. Why the gloom? Why? Why allow
[1:29:34] the the the the things to to rule in our
[1:29:37] mind and our in in our in our families
[1:29:40] and and and then the situations around
[1:29:43] us? Why do we do it? Why do we allow
[1:29:45] that?
[1:29:49] You're not You're not a
[1:29:51] beggar. You're not a slave. You're not a
[1:29:55] servant. You're a son and
[1:29:58] daughter. Your
[1:30:00] prayer. I'm not saying we got somebody
[1:30:03] that feels sorry for you, but good
[1:30:05] grief. They've got those guys in the
[1:30:07] nursing home. Amen. You feeling sorry
[1:30:10] for those people and helping them out
[1:30:12] here and there. But that ain't what
[1:30:14] God's got.
[1:30:16] You've got a representation
[1:30:20] there. You've got one in the heavens
[1:30:24] that is standing there that is
[1:30:27] representing you in all of his majesty
[1:30:30] and all of his
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:37] glory. He's your He's your
[1:30:39] representation here this morning or this
[1:30:42] evening. He's your representation. It's
[1:30:46] his glory that is upon that that that is
[1:30:49] there before the father. God sees no sin
[1:30:53] in him. God sees no wrong in
[1:30:59] him. God sees no blemish in
[1:31:04] Christ. He sees nothing. He sees nothing
[1:31:08] but purity and righteousness and
[1:31:10] holiness. He sees a king. He sees one
[1:31:13] who has prevailed and done what no other
[1:31:15] man could ever do. When God looks at
[1:31:17] Jesus, he sees And when God looks at
[1:31:19] you, all he sees is Jesus.
[1:31:24] He's your representation. When God looks
[1:31:27] at you, he sees
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:34] Jesus. So don't be praying your gloom.
[1:31:38] Be praying in the name of Jesus.
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:42] You can't come in depression in the name
[1:31:44] of Jesus because Jesus is a conqueror.
[1:31:46] You can't pray as a loser in the name of
[1:31:48] Jesus because Jesus is a conqueror. You
[1:31:52] can't Well, come on church. You got to
[1:31:54] stand up and say, "I am the one that he
[1:31:57] went to the heavens for. He's paid the
[1:32:00] price for
[1:32:02] me." Hallelujah.
[1:32:06] Glory to
[1:32:08] God. Going to rise. Rise above it
[1:32:13] all. Going to set my wings and fly
[1:32:18] away. Going to
[1:32:21] rise.
[1:32:23] Oh, I'm going to
[1:32:26] rise. Going to
[1:32:29] rise. Rise
[1:32:31] above. I'm going to
[1:32:35] rise. Going to rise. Rise above it all.
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:49] Hey, what about our brother Ron
[1:32:52] [Music]
[1:32:54] Spencer? Have those three
[1:32:58] tumors? Totally looked
[1:33:02] impossible. He was told he had he was
[1:33:06] told he had cancer in both eyes.
[1:33:09] He had four or five specialists that had
[1:33:12] all told
[1:33:13] him that he had
[1:33:15] cancer. They were already planning to
[1:33:18] take the eyes
[1:33:21] out. He went to the
[1:33:24] doctor.
[1:33:25] Hallelujah. And when he walked into the
[1:33:28] room, the doctor looked at him and said,
[1:33:30] "There's nothing
[1:33:32] there." He
[1:33:34] says, "Come back in six months." Then he
[1:33:38] walks out. He looks at his wife and he
[1:33:41] looks she looks at him and he gets the
[1:33:43] nurse and he says, "Bring him back in
[1:33:45] here." He just acted so nonchalant about
[1:33:48] the whole thing and he
[1:33:49] says, "You told me and your staff and
[1:33:53] this all these specialists before has
[1:33:54] been telling me to prepare. I've got
[1:33:57] cancer in both eyes. I've got tumors in
[1:34:01] my head. and to prepare to have my the
[1:34:04] reason I'm coming today is you were
[1:34:06] wanting to look at him again and see
[1:34:08] what how when you were going to be able
[1:34:10] to do it. The guy sat down and
[1:34:15] laughed. He says, "All I can tell
[1:34:19] you is there's those reports and here's
[1:34:22] these reports and there is zero cancer.
[1:34:34] Now, that's been that's been a few
[1:34:36] months
[1:34:37] ago, but he's still been having those
[1:34:39] seizures on a daily basis. I mean, he
[1:34:42] has he has 14 15 of them at a time. I've
[1:34:45] been with him when he when you
[1:34:48] know when he is on the ground holding
[1:34:51] the stool, hugging the stool and just
[1:34:53] vomiting. This is a daily routine for
[1:34:56] brother Ron Spencer. It's been five
[1:34:58] years he's been going through this with
[1:34:59] these tumors in his
[1:35:01] head.
[1:35:03] Amen. Five years. Five years ago, they
[1:35:06] gave him four months and he would be
[1:35:08] dead. The doctors have been using him.
[1:35:12] They've been using him as as
[1:35:14] as a as the poster
[1:35:17] boy saying
[1:35:21] listen telling the other P he he has
[1:35:23] talked he has talked to scores of other
[1:35:27] patients telling them to keep on
[1:35:29] fighting keep on believing that God can
[1:35:31] do it matter of fact there are he's got
[1:35:34] he's got so many cancer patients that
[1:35:36] listen to him every every Saturday I
[1:35:38] believe it's Saturday night when he
[1:35:40] preaches over there he's got cancer
[1:35:42] patients all over the world that tunes
[1:35:43] in and listens to him because he's the
[1:35:45] miracle boy.
[1:35:51] Guys, just last
[1:35:53] week, just last week, he went back
[1:35:57] in and had those scans done. He's had
[1:36:02] dozens, dozens of scans on that
[1:36:08] brain. And every tumor was
[1:36:23] gone. What is
[1:36:25] it? It is a
[1:36:27] fight. It is a
[1:36:30] struggle. But don't gut it. Stand up to
[1:36:33] your position and tell that devil he's a
[1:36:36] liar.
[1:36:38] Damn that
[1:36:39] devil. You're not listening to his junk
[1:36:43] anymore. I've been redeemed. I'm a son
[1:36:46] of God and I can expect the
[1:36:51] supernatural. You can expect it. We
[1:36:54] should all expect
[1:36:58] it.
[1:37:01] Amen. The thing is we got to stand up to
[1:37:03] him. You say, "Oh, it's real." No, those
[1:37:06] are just those are those are just
[1:37:08] mirages. The devil you say, "Well, I'm
[1:37:09] feeling it." It's a mirage.
[1:37:13] Your soul knows who you are. And let the
[1:37:16] soul live for crying out loud. Let the
[1:37:20] soul
[1:37:21] believe. Quit listening to all your
[1:37:23] stupid symptoms. Quit listening to all
[1:37:26] of these other things going on. Stand up
[1:37:29] like a daughter of God. Stand up like a
[1:37:32] son of God. and take your
[1:37:38] rights. We're fixing to pray for Aunt
[1:37:40] Angie
[1:37:42] here.
[1:37:43] Amen. She's she's got some hernas and
[1:37:48] we're just believing the Lord to take
[1:37:50] care of an Angie. You believe the
[1:37:52] anointing is here to do so.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah. And it's not it's not
[1:37:58] anything in my hands. It's
[1:38:00] in it's in the believers
[1:38:04] knowing who they are. It's the position
[1:38:06] that we have been exalted to those who
[1:38:09] would want to gather around with Aunt
[1:38:11] Angie and pray with her. Amen. You're
[1:38:14] welcome to come up and and and lay hands
[1:38:17] on her. Amen. Let's believe the
[1:38:21] Lord. The Lord's our
[1:38:23] healer. Amen. She's also been having
[1:38:25] that stomach trouble. just don't know if
[1:38:28] that's associated with it. But amen, the
[1:38:30] Lord knows all about those things. He's
[1:38:33] the great high priest. He's been there.
[1:38:35] He
[1:38:37] knows. It's a man. Christ Jesus, the man
[1:38:42] has paid the price. He knows what it's
[1:38:44] like. He suffered death and sickness for
[1:38:47] us, but he's raised.
[1:38:50] Father, Lord
[1:38:52] Jesus, you
[1:38:54] see you here, Lord.
[1:38:57] And that old devil would like to take
[1:39:00] away the joy of Lord her golden years
[1:39:05] and make her sickly. And
[1:39:10] Lord, but God, she's already lived her
[1:39:14] life, Lord, through her young life
[1:39:17] working and providing for her children.
[1:39:19] And
[1:39:20] Lord, we want to see her enjoy her life
[1:39:24] until you come.
[1:39:26] And I'm asking God that you
[1:39:31] would you would
[1:39:33] hear Jesus the conqueror. He's already
[1:39:37] there representing us. It's his blood
[1:39:40] that has been
[1:39:42] shed for our sickness and our healing.
[1:39:46] And I'm asking God that you would bring
[1:39:48] that healing to her body and manifest it
[1:39:50] in the name of Jesus. Ask him that you
[1:39:53] would touch that stomach, that you would
[1:39:55] heal those hernas, that your blessings
[1:39:58] would come down upon her. Lord, Satan,
[1:40:01] you're a liar. We're not walking by
[1:40:03] symptoms. We're walking by the
[1:40:05] supernatural. We're looking to you,
[1:40:08] Father. We thank you. We come through
[1:40:11] our representative, the one that you
[1:40:14] have exalted in your
[1:40:15] throne, the one that you have made heir
[1:40:18] of all things. We ask it in his name for
[1:40:22] he's paid for it in the name of
[1:40:25] Jesus. I thank you for it Lord in Jesus
[1:40:30] name.

[1:40:38] the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. It's who
[1:40:41] we are. It's what we are. Fellowship has

[1:40:52] Hallelujah. We believe it. How many
[1:40:55] believes it here tonight? Hallelujah.
[1:40:58] He didn't ask if you if you feel it. He
[1:41:01] didn't ask if you see it. He said, "Do
[1:41:02] you believe it?"
[1:41:05] And we believe it. We believe
[1:41:08] it. We've been invited into this. This
[1:41:10] is what God
[1:41:12] came to earth as a man
[1:41:15] for to bring us back to this privilege.
[1:41:19] Can you say
[1:41:20] amen?
[1:41:23] Amen. Anyone else want to be prayed for
[1:41:26] while we've got us all gathered here
[1:41:28] tonight?
