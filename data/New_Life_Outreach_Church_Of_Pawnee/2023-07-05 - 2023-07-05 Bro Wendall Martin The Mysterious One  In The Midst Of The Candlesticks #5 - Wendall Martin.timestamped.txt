[41:02] fifth age sixth age didn't didn't have
[41:06] the Rapture it was not according to the
[41:08] predestinated will of God Amen now they
[41:11] were looking for the Rapture because the
[41:13] mysteries of God had not been unveiled
[41:15] unto them yet so they all went down into
[41:17] the grave expecting that it was going to
[41:19] happen in their generation but it's in
[41:23] this age that God has come unveiled it
[41:26] all and said you're the people
[41:28] you're the ones and so we look to him

[45:50] Revelations one and
[45:53] um
[45:55] praise the lord
[45:57] we will
[45:59] look in here
[46:03] where we want to
[46:07] the eighth verse I am Alpha
[46:10] and Omega the beginning and the end
[46:13] saith the Lord
[46:15] which is which was which is to come the
[46:20] almighty God
[46:22] amen now that's now this is Jesus he's
[46:24] the personification of God now hi John
[46:28] who also am your brother and companion
[46:30] and tribulation in the kingdom and
[46:33] patience of Jesus Christ was in the
[46:35] aisle that is called Patmos for the word
[46:37] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[46:40] Christ
[46:41] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[46:43] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[46:46] a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Omega the
[46:49] first and the last what thou seeest
[46:52] write in a book and send it into the
[46:54] seven churches which are in Asia unto
[46:57] Ephesus Myrna pergamus the Tyra Sardis
[47:00] Philadelphia and laodicea and I turned
[47:03] to see the voice that spake unto speak
[47:06] with me and being turned I saw the seven
[47:09] golden candlesticks in the midst of the
[47:12] seven candlesticks was one likened the
[47:14] son of man clothed with a garment down
[47:17] to the foot gird about the paps with a
[47:19] golden girdle his head and his hair were
[47:23] white like wool as white as snow his
[47:26] eyes were as flame of fire his feet like
[47:29] undefined brass as they burn in a
[47:31] furnace
[47:32] his voice is the sound of many Waters
[47:35] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[47:38] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[47:40] two-edged sword in his countenance was
[47:44] as the sun that shineth in his strength
[47:47] amen let's go to the Lord in prayer
[47:50] father we want to thank you today for
[47:53] your blessings and and we appreciate
[47:56] your these songs and
[47:59] Lord the uh the special that was sung
[48:02] tonight
[48:03] and we're just asking the Lord that your
[48:05] Holy Spirit would be here with us in a
[48:07] real special way
[48:08] I pray Lord that that you would speak to
[48:12] us and just help all of our hearts and
[48:14] our minds to be sharp and and Lord let
[48:19] me be what you want say what you want me
[48:21] to say Lord and let us hear from you
[48:24] tonight
[48:25] and father you see brother Colby the
[48:28] Lord just not feeling well he's had a
[48:30] headache for a couple of days and
[48:33] and father I'm asking that you would
[48:35] touch him tonight that you would make
[48:37] him whole father I pray Lord that you
[48:40] would see brother Mitch that Lord fell
[48:42] and and the Lord he's already been
[48:45] having such problems with his legs and
[48:47] and father I I just pray that you would
[48:50] help him tonight and let him know that
[48:53] we all love him father
[48:55] strengthen him as our prayer just ask
[48:58] the Lord that you would always be with
[49:00] our elders Lord be with the Applegates
[49:03] there in Henrietta and and just be with
[49:06] all of our elders father we love you we
[49:09] give ourselves to you tonight in Jesus
[49:12] name we pray can the Church Say Amen
[49:15] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[49:19] here this evening
[49:20] praise the Lord
[49:22] so we want to continue on with this
[49:25] mysterious one that is walking in the
[49:29] midst of the of the Furnace
[49:31] and
[49:32] amen or in in the midst of the
[49:35] candlesticks should I say and
[49:38] um now this the last the last Wednesday
[49:41] that we dealt with this we took a break
[49:43] this of course this last Wednesday night
[49:45] and so now here we are dealing with this
[49:51] with this um the 16th verse
[49:56] last week we dealt with uh you know his
[49:58] his
[49:59] um he had the the Seven Stars and
[50:02] tonight we want to deal with his mouth
[50:04] out of his mouth when a sharp two had
[50:07] sword and so as we went through the last
[50:10] uh the the last time we talked about the
[50:14] redeeming Lamb with the seven horns and
[50:17] seven eyes
[50:19] and so we dealt with
[50:22] some of the sevens of the Bible and how
[50:25] that seven is a is the number of
[50:29] completion and and so we we had dealt
[50:33] also a man of of two words that that
[50:38] um amen
[50:39] came from the same root word and that is
[50:43] the promise and seven so the swearing of
[50:48] an oath or the promise comes from the
[50:51] word Shabba
[50:53] and the Hebrew word for seven comes from
[50:57] Sheba and so they both derive from the
[51:01] same Hebrew word Saba amen and so this
[51:06] and it literally means
[51:08] satisfaction or fullness and so this is
[51:13] something when we look at the sevens of
[51:16] the Bible amen at the end of seven
[51:21] sabbaths seven sabbaths would would come
[51:24] the Year of Jubilee they would also take
[51:28] the priest would take the blood of the
[51:30] lamb and he would dip his finger into
[51:33] that blood and he would sprinkle it
[51:36] seven times on The Mercy Seat amen this
[51:41] would be this is speaking of completion
[51:44] amen so and it was it was dealing with
[51:47] the seven Church ages and how that there
[51:50] would be atoning blood for the entire
[51:53] church church period amen that would go
[51:57] from the time that Christ is caught up
[51:59] to the time that we are caught up amen
[52:03] so when from the time that Christ is
[52:06] caught up into the heavens and he says
[52:09] I'm going to come back and receive you
[52:11] up to me amen so the time that time to
[52:16] this time when we're caught up in
[52:18] Rapture then there are seven distinct
[52:21] periods of time now God divided them up
[52:24] into seven periods of time it's still
[52:27] the same church still the same bride
[52:30] still the same uh there's there's
[52:33] there's nothing different as far as
[52:35] specialness other than we are the ones
[52:38] that are going to uh uh be alive and
[52:42] remain amen but we're not but the you
[52:45] know the dead in Christ are going to
[52:47] rise amen and and we which are alive
[52:51] shall be caught up to meet them so so
[52:55] we've we've all been given the same
[52:57] promise the only thing is is in the last
[53:01] stage is when God is unveiling it all
[53:05] amen he's bringing it all out and he's
[53:08] saying okay this is what I've been doing
[53:12] this is what we should prepare for and
[53:15] look to and it's that word that is going
[53:18] to really spark rapturing Faith within
[53:22] our lives amen so so the so God put
[53:26] these in in in in distinct periods and
[53:30] and he and he separated him up into
[53:32] these seven periods so that you could
[53:35] look and see what God was doing right
[53:38] here in the in the first period in the
[53:41] second period in the third period all
[53:44] the way down so it's easy for a human
[53:46] mind to be able to comprehend ha I can
[53:50] see what God and what the Antichrist has
[53:53] been doing I can see what God's been
[53:55] doing to bring us back I mean he's
[53:57] understanding that so we're we're
[53:59] thankful for that and and and you see
[54:01] it's this is the unveiling of God's plan
[54:05] amen God has taken the cover off and
[54:09] letting us see things that they the the
[54:12] previous periods of time have not been
[54:15] able to see
[54:17] and so I I think it's a glorious thing
[54:20] and I believe as brother Branham says as
[54:22] the church wants the church finds out
[54:25] who she is the rapture will take place
[54:28] and that's why it's important for us to
[54:31] really do our homework and and not
[54:34] necessarily you know going to college or
[54:37] and to learn uh uh you know a Bible
[54:40] Seminary but to take the words of this
[54:43] prophet and really plant them deep into
[54:46] our hearts and say I believe what that
[54:51] Prophet taught us now if you're still
[54:53] wrestling with a prophet you know I you
[54:55] know I understand I was I was there at a
[54:58] at a certain point where I was trying to
[55:00] figure out and I amen but after a while
[55:04] and I and I kept searching out his words
[55:07] and I had to do that now I and you have
[55:09] to too especially if if you're coming
[55:11] from a denominational background amen
[55:14] all right man and I I would go back and
[55:16] I'd take what he said and I just gonna
[55:19] look through scripture then you know
[55:20] what I have found amen God's Prophet
[55:23] brought light to the scripture and I'm
[55:27] so thankful for the light that God has
[55:30] brought amen I'm very thankful Sue we're
[55:33] we're thankful for these amen for the
[55:36] blood of the Covenant we're thankful for
[55:39] the for the mercy we're thankful that
[55:41] God in in so many of these old place Old
[55:44] Testament places
[55:45] showed the sevens and and exactly how
[55:49] this would all take place and I'm glad
[55:52] tonight that there is an intercessor
[55:55] with the blood that is that is ready
[55:58] amen interceding for your Perfection
[56:00] there will come a time where the lamb
[56:03] amen will no longer uh uh uh intercede
[56:07] for you that he'll take up the role of
[56:10] the lion is that right now another thing
[56:14] I want us to always keep in mind and
[56:15] I've been bringing it out every time is
[56:17] we've got to always keep in mind that
[56:20] that uh uh Jesus is declaring his deity
[56:26] here in this book He's declaring now
[56:30] amen now you read the you you read
[56:33] Matthew Mark Luke and John amen and they
[56:37] talk a lot about his Humanity especially
[56:39] those first three Matthew Mark and Luke
[56:41] talks about the humanity of Christ
[56:43] whereas John begins to really bring in
[56:47] the deity how that the father is living
[56:52] within that body amen now cry taste is
[56:56] coming and of course the Apostle Paul in
[56:59] the book of Colossians in the book of
[57:00] Philippians in the book of Hebrews the
[57:04] the Apostle Paul takes especially those
[57:06] three books to really declare that this
[57:10] body the body of Jesus Christ has has
[57:15] been so exalted in the heavens amen it
[57:20] that that God has has given that body a
[57:25] name and in fact he becomes the very uh
[57:28] Jesus is the very fulfillment or the
[57:32] very manifestation the very uh image of
[57:36] the invisible God so God living in
[57:39] Christ so now when you look at Christ
[57:42] amen you are seeing the Redemptive work
[57:46] of God God needed a body to redeem
[57:51] he was always a savior he was always a
[57:54] redeemer but according to his own words
[57:57] and his own laws he had to become a
[58:01] Kinsman to you
[58:03] and you were a Kinsman in the in in the
[58:05] spirit you were made in the image of God
[58:08] so the word of God was here on the earth
[58:11] in a fallen body amen so God the great
[58:16] Eternal Word in order to redeem the
[58:20] Fallen words here had to come create a
[58:24] body move inside that body and do his
[58:27] redeeming work
[58:29] aren't you glad for that now there's too
[58:32] many people try to make uh you know
[58:35] they'll they'll take certain things and
[58:37] and as we said last week amen when it
[58:39] says there's seven spirits Before the
[58:41] Throne amen well you know you can you
[58:44] can't make seven you can't make seven
[58:46] gods it is God working in seven distinct
[58:50] periods with seven seers except can you
[58:54] say man amen the horns the seven horns
[58:58] were the uh uh were the lamb strength to
[59:01] stand there before that word and for
[59:04] that people and so we're thankful for
[59:06] that here tonight now uh uh another
[59:10] thing that we wanted to go back on just
[59:12] real quickly remember he had the Seven
[59:13] Stars in his right hand Amen in his
[59:16] right hand what does right mean the
[59:19] right hand is the is is a position of
[59:23] authority amen so when it's being he's
[59:27] my right hand man that means that man is
[59:31] is is is everything to that fella can
[59:34] you say Amen so amen when you say well
[59:37] she's my right hand man or he's my right
[59:39] hand that is talking of authority
[59:41] position one that is right there and so
[59:45] Christ is saying now he's got seven
[59:48] Messengers throughout these throughout
[59:51] these this period between the Rapture of
[59:54] Christ and the Rapture of the church
[59:56] that there's going to be seven distinct
[59:59] men with the eyes of God the lamps of
[1:00:05] God remember seven eyes seven lamps
[1:00:08] seven horns
[1:00:12] amen these were all declaring seven men
[1:00:16] with divine revelation to that church
[1:00:20] age y'all got that amen and so
[1:00:23] Hallelujah you swear I just don't know
[1:00:25] if I can trust brother Branham well I
[1:00:27] want to tell you I don't know if I can
[1:00:29] trust your opinion of brother Branham
[1:00:32] I trust God's opinion of brother branna
[1:00:34] because he said he's got the Seven Stars
[1:00:38] in his right hand
[1:00:41] amen so when those seven Messengers come
[1:00:44] you don't have to second-guess them you
[1:00:47] know when God vindicates them and God
[1:00:49] says they are mine Hallelujah all we
[1:00:53] have to do is say I believe it
[1:00:57] I believe it can you say amen and so so
[1:01:00] we're thankful for that amen so we've
[1:01:03] got the Seven Stars the seven eyes the
[1:01:07] seven lamps the seven horns talking
[1:01:09] about the anointing amen the Revelation
[1:01:12] given to in the Seven Stars were Earthly
[1:01:16] uh uh Messengers according to
[1:01:18] Revelations the first chapter Earthly
[1:01:21] Messengers and so it's these Spirits the
[1:01:23] seven spirits of God coming in and
[1:01:26] exhibiting himself in Earth a man upon
[1:01:31] the the Earth how many understands that
[1:01:32] now any questions on that
[1:01:35] any questions you kids y'all y'all got
[1:01:37] that amen so so when we look at these
[1:01:41] things they're symbols amen declaring
[1:01:44] just making it easy for us to be able to
[1:01:47] see what God's going to be doing so what
[1:01:50] church age are we in
[1:01:54] number seven we're in number seven amen
[1:01:58] how do I know
[1:02:00] because the Bible says in Revelation put
[1:02:02] that up Revelations uh 10 and 7 but in
[1:02:06] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:02:09] messenger when he shall begin to sound
[1:02:13] all of the mystery should be finished
[1:02:17] mystery of what mystery of redemption so
[1:02:21] our Prophet came to go back and to show
[1:02:26] where we have been all of these ages and
[1:02:30] I just want to say thank you Jesus
[1:02:33] amen so tonight we're going to deal with
[1:02:37] um out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:02:40] two-edged sword and and so
[1:02:43] um and you know this may be uh uh
[1:02:47] repetitious of what we may know but I I
[1:02:50] just want I I want to go back through
[1:02:52] here and and this is not exhaustive but
[1:02:56] I'm I'm wanting to uh you know just take
[1:02:58] the next uh 30 40 minutes and into uh
[1:03:02] and and to deal with this so what
[1:03:04] connection does a sword and the mouth
[1:03:07] have now now this is sort of interesting
[1:03:10] why would there be a sharp sword come
[1:03:14] out of the mouth question
[1:03:17] amen why would a sword come out of the
[1:03:20] mouth
[1:03:21] anyone anyone got any any ideas to why
[1:03:25] praise the Lord
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:28] huh
[1:03:30] I seen you amen
[1:03:34] huh
[1:03:36] the word the word that the God's word is
[1:03:41] a
[1:03:42] sword
[1:03:43] now so let's let's look because that
[1:03:46] that just makes a you think how in the
[1:03:49] world and where does this come from and
[1:03:52] so now let's just let's just stop for a
[1:03:54] moment let's just look at the word of
[1:03:56] God now is and once again I'm going to
[1:04:00] ask you all some more questions
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:03] is this the word of God
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:10] so was this Bible
[1:04:12] eternal
[1:04:14] so this is not the word of God
[1:04:19] this declares the word of God
[1:04:23] Hallelujah
[1:04:26] the Bible had a time that it was written
[1:04:28] the Bible has a time and we you know
[1:04:31] that little this this little thing right
[1:04:34] here will end
[1:04:35] the word is living the Living Word is
[1:04:40] not words on a page now this declares
[1:04:45] the word we believe that this is amen
[1:04:48] the infallible word of God true but
[1:04:52] God's desire has not been to write a
[1:04:56] Bible and say that's my masterpiece the
[1:05:00] the the Jesus was the word made flesh
[1:05:05] God's desire is for his bride to be word
[1:05:11] made flesh now although I agree you you
[1:05:14] answered correctly when you said is is
[1:05:16] this the word of God yes it is the word
[1:05:19] of God but the Bible itself the words on
[1:05:22] this page you can use all of every one
[1:05:25] of these words to write many books you
[1:05:28] there's been many books written using
[1:05:30] the same words that are on this page on
[1:05:34] these Pages can you say am I making
[1:05:36] sense so but the word the logos is the
[1:05:41] Living Word it's the Living Word of God
[1:05:45] now the Living Word of God is
[1:05:47] all-knowing because God is omniscient
[1:05:51] God is all-knowing God is all wise amen
[1:05:56] God's thoughts have existed with him
[1:06:02] throughout all eternity
[1:06:05] so God's thoughts you go back and think
[1:06:08] about God Amen
[1:06:11] Luke when did God come into existence
[1:06:20] huh
[1:06:21] Aaron when did God come into existence
[1:06:26] Hallelujah
[1:06:29] he has no beginning
[1:06:32] God has no beginning
[1:06:34] so he's he's been here for eons and eons
[1:06:38] and eons and eons and eons of time
[1:06:41] and his thoughts are just as eternal
[1:06:45] so God knew the the the start
[1:06:50] to the ending he knew it all
[1:06:54] eternally it was now it'll blow your
[1:06:56] mind because it's hard to really grasp
[1:06:59] this God has always known everything
[1:07:05] for eternity
[1:07:08] he's a living word hallelujah now we're
[1:07:11] just learning this and the prophets had
[1:07:14] a time that they spoke this but they
[1:07:16] were anointed by the logos or the living
[1:07:21] word amen are y'all catching that now so
[1:07:25] his thoughts have existed with him
[1:07:29] eternally amen he has known the end from
[1:07:32] the beginning nothing ever catches God
[1:07:36] by surprise sister uh Carol lupus has
[1:07:40] not caught God by surprise he's seen it
[1:07:43] for eons and eons and eons of time
[1:07:47] before that's why he provided amen
[1:07:50] that's the reason why he provided a lamb
[1:07:53] blood for each one of those ages
[1:07:57] he's provided that for us while he is
[1:08:00] bringing us through this Earthly Journey
[1:08:02] unto himself praise the Lord amen so so
[1:08:06] now God is Not Like the Wind God is not
[1:08:09] God's he's invisible that is true but
[1:08:12] he's not like the wind amen he's he's
[1:08:15] he's omnipresent but but he's it's not
[1:08:19] that God is present uh uh everywhere at
[1:08:24] all times God is a being God lives in a
[1:08:30] body and that body is in heaven
[1:08:35] everyone say God is a being
[1:08:39] he lives in a body
[1:08:42] and that body is in heaven Hallelujah so
[1:08:46] God is Not omnipresent everywhere at the
[1:08:50] same time except in his knowledge God is
[1:08:55] omnip omniscience in or God is
[1:08:59] omnipresent him that he is omniscient
[1:09:01] amen he is here because he is
[1:09:05] all-knowing
[1:09:07] praise the Lord can you say Amen now and
[1:09:11] so he is a bill a being that dwells in a
[1:09:15] house amen he's not at the the figment
[1:09:17] of your imagination he's not just the
[1:09:20] figment of someone else's imagination
[1:09:21] there is a real God living in a real
[1:09:26] body living in a real heaven
[1:09:31] brother Branham says there can't be a
[1:09:33] flea that uh that is I but what he noted
[1:09:37] he noted before there was a world how
[1:09:40] many times it bad its eye how much towel
[1:09:43] it had in it before there ever was a
[1:09:46] world that is infinite we can comprehend
[1:09:49] it in our minds
[1:09:51] but that's God God is infinite can you
[1:09:54] say Amen now
[1:09:57] uh so so now how many how many
[1:09:59] understands
[1:10:01] um and understands where I'm at so far
[1:10:05] amen so you kids understand that the
[1:10:07] invisible God is a being
[1:10:10] amen all right now brother brother
[1:10:13] Branham would tell us
[1:10:15] um uh he's got he's got several places
[1:10:18] here you know he he says he says it's
[1:10:22] just like he says now God in the
[1:10:24] beginning God dwelt all alone with his
[1:10:26] attributes as I spoke of this morning
[1:10:28] that's his thoughts uh that there was
[1:10:31] nothing just God alone but he had
[1:10:33] thoughts and just like a great architect
[1:10:35] can sit down in his mind and draw out
[1:10:37] what he thinks he's he's going to build
[1:10:39] to create he cannot now he cannot create
[1:10:42] he can take something that's been
[1:10:45] created and make it a different form
[1:10:47] because God is the only one that can
[1:10:49] create but he gets in his mind what he's
[1:10:52] going to do and that's his thoughts
[1:10:54] that's his desires and he says now it's
[1:10:58] a thought then he speaks it then it's a
[1:11:00] word a thought when it's expressed is a
[1:11:04] word a thought expressed is a word but
[1:11:07] it has to be a thought so it's it's God
[1:11:10] God's attributes then as it becomes a
[1:11:14] thought then it becomes a a word amen
[1:11:19] now he says now
[1:11:22] he says if he's if he isn't infinite he
[1:11:26] isn't God God has to be infinite we are
[1:11:29] finite he is infinite we he was
[1:11:32] omnipresent omniscient omnipotent if he
[1:11:35] isn't then he can't be God he knows all
[1:11:38] things all places because of his
[1:11:40] omnipresence omniscience makes him
[1:11:42] omnipresent he is a being he's not like
[1:11:45] the wind he's a being dwells in a house
[1:11:48] but being omniscient knowing all things
[1:11:50] makes him omnipresent because he knows
[1:11:54] everything that is going on now so now
[1:11:57] we find Christ we find this one this
[1:12:00] mysterious one in the in that is coming
[1:12:04] out and he's got he's got sward coming
[1:12:07] out of his mouth and so in other in in
[1:12:11] order to understand what this is we can
[1:12:14] understand that it's his word amen and
[1:12:17] that the word is all-knowing nothing
[1:12:20] happens but what he knows about what did
[1:12:23] Jesus say there in Matthew 10 and 29
[1:12:28] and I tell you what I'm going to hold
[1:12:30] you you can you can just write that down
[1:12:32] but I'm just going to refer to it for
[1:12:33] now it says are not Two Sparrows so for
[1:12:37] a farting and one of them shall uh one
[1:12:40] of them shall not fall on the ground
[1:12:43] without your father amen annoying but
[1:12:47] but the very hairs of your head are all
[1:12:51] numbered he says fear not therefore ye
[1:12:55] are more valuable than the than the
[1:12:57] sparrow so he's saying God even knows
[1:13:00] all every one of your hair he knows
[1:13:04] everyone that falls out he knows every
[1:13:06] sparrow that falls from the sky he knows
[1:13:09] it all amen
[1:13:11] amen now Psalms uh 139 and 2 and we'll
[1:13:16] go ahead and turn there I think it's a
[1:13:18] good one for you kids to uh to Mark
[1:13:21] in your Bible
[1:13:24] praise the Lord
[1:13:27] any any comments anyone wants to make
[1:13:29] right now
[1:13:39] all right that's talking about the word
[1:13:41] the word is all-knowing so I want us to
[1:13:45] we got to get this thing settled down
[1:13:46] right now in our hearts the word is all
[1:13:49] knowing you're saying well I sure hope
[1:13:51] you get to the sword well we've got to
[1:13:53] find out what the word is first
[1:13:55] amen what's this nature of this word
[1:13:58] thou knowest if you've got a pen Mark
[1:14:02] that knowest thou knowest
[1:14:07] it's Psalms 139 and 2 my down sittings
[1:14:10] and uprising
[1:14:12] thou understandest right then Mark that
[1:14:16] understand us my thoughts
[1:14:20] are far off
[1:14:22] amen before I even get my thoughts
[1:14:25] together you already know
[1:14:28] thou compassest
[1:14:31] you can mark that word compasses my path
[1:14:36] and my lying down
[1:14:38] and art acquainted with all my ways
[1:14:43] there is not a word in my tongue
[1:14:47] but Lo O Lord thou knowest
[1:14:51] it all together that's a good one to
[1:14:53] underline thou Hast beset me behind and
[1:14:57] before and laid thine hand upon me
[1:15:01] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[1:15:04] it is high and I cannot attain to it
[1:15:08] wither shall I go from thy Spirit
[1:15:11] whether shall I flee from thy presence
[1:15:14] we're still talking about the
[1:15:16] all-knowing God
[1:15:19] if I Ascend up into heaven
[1:15:21] you are there if I make my bed in hell
[1:15:25] Thou Art there if I take the wings of
[1:15:28] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[1:15:31] parts of the sea
[1:15:33] even there
[1:15:35] shalt thy hand lead me and thy right
[1:15:39] hand shall uphold me can you say Amen if
[1:15:44] I say surely Darkness shall cover me
[1:15:46] even the night shall be light unto me
[1:15:49] yea the darkness hideth not from thee
[1:15:52] but the knights shineth as the day and
[1:15:56] the Darkness and Light are both alike in
[1:15:58] other words
[1:15:59] God knows everything
[1:16:05] everything
[1:16:07] you might hide things from Mom and Dad
[1:16:09] but God knows
[1:16:11] everything
[1:16:13] you might hide things from your husband
[1:16:15] or wife
[1:16:16] God knows
[1:16:18] everything
[1:16:20] and we need to understand
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:24] that that knowledge that God has that
[1:16:28] word we're fixing to see at the end
[1:16:30] those that that that Living Word is
[1:16:35] going to judge us someday it will become
[1:16:39] a sword of judgment to all of those
[1:16:43] who have lived hypocritical calling him
[1:16:46] God calling him Lord saying that and our
[1:16:49] hearts he knows everything
[1:16:53] can you say Amen
[1:16:55] so we we need to understand who we're
[1:16:58] dealing with this is not a religion this
[1:17:02] is a living God
[1:17:04] all right amen so this 12th verse he
[1:17:08] says
[1:17:09] or the 13th verse
[1:17:12] for thou has possessed my Reigns thou
[1:17:15] has covered me in my mother's womb let's
[1:17:17] just go ahead and finish him
[1:17:19] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[1:17:21] and wonderfully made marvelous are thy
[1:17:24] works and thy and my soul knoweth right
[1:17:26] well my substance was not hid from thee
[1:17:29] When I Was Made In Secret
[1:17:32] and curiously rot in the lowest parts of
[1:17:35] the Earth
[1:17:36] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[1:17:40] being unperfect why did you say that
[1:17:42] that word meant Mary do you remember
[1:17:44] that unperfect as uh as as of yet
[1:17:48] unformed
[1:17:51] was it something like that
[1:17:53] um she sent me a little something here a
[1:17:55] while back and I love that Thine Eyes
[1:17:57] did see my substance
[1:17:59] not being made or being yet unperfect
[1:18:03] and in thy book all my members are
[1:18:06] written which in continuance were
[1:18:08] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:18:11] them
[1:18:12] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[1:18:15] me o God how great is the sum of them if
[1:18:18] I should count them they're more than
[1:18:20] the number than sand when I awake I am
[1:18:23] still with thee so he is saying his
[1:18:26] knowledge is so incredible that he don't
[1:18:29] see he don't just see what you look like
[1:18:31] now he saw you in your mama's womb
[1:18:34] before you were ever even formed
[1:18:39] Hallelujah now uh we we've got sister
[1:18:43] Loretta's PR uh pregnant she's got a
[1:18:46] baby and and but the god already seen
[1:18:50] everything when it was just a little
[1:18:52] bitty seed he's already seeing the color
[1:18:55] of the hair he knows what that baby is
[1:18:57] going to look like what it's going to be
[1:18:58] like can you say Amen so so that that's
[1:19:02] the reason why if you look there in
[1:19:04] Isaiah let's look in Isaiah 46 and 9.
[1:19:09] and then we'll get we'll get on into my
[1:19:11] point
[1:19:12] amen Isaiah 46
[1:19:16] and and nine and and it says
[1:19:20] I'll I'll wait for you there
[1:19:25] praise the Lord
[1:19:28] when you get there you can say Amen
[1:19:31] that Psalms Proverbs ecclesiastics Song
[1:19:34] of Solomon
[1:19:36] and then Isaiah
[1:19:38] praise the Lord it says remember the
[1:19:41] former things
[1:19:43] Abode for I am God and there is none
[1:19:45] else I am God and there is none like me
[1:19:48] declaring the beginning
[1:19:51] from the beginning and from ancient
[1:19:53] times the things that are not yet done
[1:19:57] saying my counsel shall stand and I will
[1:20:00] do all my pleasure so here we got it
[1:20:02] this word this Living Word it's
[1:20:07] all-knowing
[1:20:08] it it's it's it pulsating with the life
[1:20:12] of God in it it's the logos it's the
[1:20:15] pillar of fire that is that Living Word
[1:20:19] and as we dealt with a couple of
[1:20:21] services ago did you know it's that
[1:20:24] logos that comes and moves on the inside
[1:20:26] of you through the Holy Ghost
[1:20:28] it's that same Pillar of Fire brother
[1:20:30] Brandon says that great light splits up
[1:20:33] and that cloven tongues of fire comes
[1:20:36] upon you to live his word through you
[1:20:39] well that should make you want to shout
[1:20:42] number two the word is a discerner amen
[1:20:46] Hebrews 12 or 4 and 12.
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:51] and we have we have already been there
[1:20:53] so you should already have this marked
[1:20:55] in your Bibles but we'll still look at
[1:20:56] it again Hebrews 4 and 12.
[1:21:01] um
[1:21:08] mm-hmm
[1:21:20] are you there
[1:21:22] all right Hebrews 4 and 12 for the word
[1:21:26] of God is quick that means living
[1:21:29] and Powerful
[1:21:31] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:21:35] so now here we got the sword again
[1:21:37] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:21:41] Soul and Spirit and the joints and moral
[1:21:44] and as a discerner
[1:21:46] of the thought and intent of the heart
[1:21:49] neither is there any creature that is
[1:21:53] not manifest in his sight
[1:21:55] for all things are naked and open unto
[1:22:00] the eyes of him
[1:22:02] with whom we have to do now you've seen
[1:22:06] what they're saying the word
[1:22:09] and he whom we have to do it's the
[1:22:11] self-same thing God lives in his word
[1:22:15] now we say God lives in his word right
[1:22:17] here but again it's not that God is
[1:22:19] sitting on the shelf I am saying this
[1:22:22] simply tells us about the Living Word
[1:22:26] that he already is are y'all hearing me
[1:22:30] the prophets came to declare what God
[1:22:34] already is that's the reason why we hold
[1:22:37] this as God's infallible word and we
[1:22:40] refuse to argue with it amen because
[1:22:42] what has been spoke here is declaring
[1:22:45] who God really is is that right that's
[1:22:48] why we honor this amen but I promise I
[1:22:52] promise you when the Rapture takes place
[1:22:53] this is going to be left on the Shelf
[1:22:59] you will be the one that is caught up
[1:23:02] we're wanting this to become this right
[1:23:06] here are y'all understanding so so we're
[1:23:09] not I'm not don't don't misunderstand me
[1:23:11] this is because I don't want to say huh
[1:23:14] brother Wendell saying that this Bible
[1:23:16] isn't isn't isn't the infallible word of
[1:23:18] God it is it's declaring who he is but
[1:23:22] there's there's no life pulsating from
[1:23:24] this book well thank goodness every
[1:23:27] denomination uses the same Bible
[1:23:29] but this mysterious one is not Pages
[1:23:32] this mysterious one is living
[1:23:35] amen praise the Lord so he's a discerner
[1:23:39] he's a discerner God is a discerner he
[1:23:42] knows what you're thinking he knows he
[1:23:44] knows where your problems are is that
[1:23:46] right how many remembers of the story
[1:23:48] there and you can write this down in
[1:23:50] your devotions
[1:23:52] everyone would enjoy it but they're in
[1:23:55] in Second Kings the sixth chapter around
[1:23:57] the eighth verse the king of Syria is uh
[1:24:02] you know he's coming to war against
[1:24:04] Israel and um and so he takes his
[1:24:07] counsel with his with his soldiers and
[1:24:09] his men and he says hey this is what
[1:24:11] we're going to do I want you all to go
[1:24:13] down there we're going to do this and
[1:24:14] this and this it's such and such a place
[1:24:16] and and uh amen and then God that great
[1:24:20] that great logos would would that was
[1:24:22] upon the prophet would would go he would
[1:24:25] go the prophet would go to the king and
[1:24:27] the king would and it would tell him uh
[1:24:29] he he says in he says
[1:24:32] the man of God sent unto the king of
[1:24:35] Israel saying beware that thou pass not
[1:24:37] in such and such place for thither the
[1:24:39] syrians are coming down and the king of
[1:24:41] Israel sent to the place which was which
[1:24:43] the man of God told him and warned him
[1:24:45] of and saved himself there not once or
[1:24:48] twice every time every time the Syrian
[1:24:51] Army would get there
[1:24:53] every time the Syrian Army would get
[1:24:54] there the guy the other guys were
[1:24:57] already ready and Israel was winning the
[1:24:59] battles and finally the Bible says that
[1:25:02] that the king of Syria called all of his
[1:25:04] guys together and says we've got a
[1:25:07] traitor Among Us that is telling my
[1:25:09] secrets to Israel
[1:25:12] and finally one of the guys lifts his
[1:25:15] hand and says King it's it's not it's
[1:25:17] not us there's a prophet over there that
[1:25:21] knows yours the secrets in your bet
[1:25:24] chamber
[1:25:26] this guy knows everything that you're
[1:25:28] doing can you say Amen it was the Living
[1:25:32] Word that Pillar of Fire that was with
[1:25:36] Israel was declaring the secrets
[1:25:41] Hallelujah listen if you if if you've
[1:25:44] got the pillar of fire on your side amen
[1:25:47] you're a blessed man
[1:25:49] right and I say we've got the pillar of
[1:25:51] fire on our side the god of Secrets is
[1:25:55] giving secrets to his people Discerning
[1:25:59] well praise the Lord and so we're we're
[1:26:02] thankful for that now I want us to look
[1:26:05] again amen so number three is that that
[1:26:09] word god anointed His prophets with amen
[1:26:13] now we understand that the scripture
[1:26:15] told us uh uh they're in Deuteronomy it
[1:26:19] and and it says that uh uh matter of
[1:26:23] fact let's just look there Deuteronomy
[1:26:24] the 18th chapter
[1:26:27] and um
[1:26:30] 18 and 15.
[1:26:34] and that's the fifth book in the Bible
[1:26:36] for you younggins
[1:26:46] praise the Lord
[1:26:48] when you get there you can say Amen
[1:26:52] all right
[1:26:54] it says the Lord
[1:26:56] thy God will raise up unto thee a
[1:27:00] prophet from the midst of Thee and of
[1:27:02] thy Brethren liken to me unto him ye
[1:27:05] shall hearken
[1:27:07] according to all that thou desirest of
[1:27:09] the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of
[1:27:11] the assembly saying let me not hear
[1:27:14] again the voice of God
[1:27:16] neither let me see this great fire
[1:27:19] anymore that I die not and the Lord said
[1:27:21] unto me they have well spoken that which
[1:27:24] they have spoken I will raise them up a
[1:27:28] prophet from among their Brethren like
[1:27:31] unto thee and will put my words in his
[1:27:34] mouth and he shall speak unto them all
[1:27:37] that I command him and it shall come to
[1:27:40] pass that whosoever will not hearken
[1:27:43] unto my words now now listen here he's
[1:27:46] saying now I'm going to raise up a
[1:27:48] prophet and when he talks and you ain't
[1:27:51] listening to my words that I've given
[1:27:55] him look what he says
[1:27:58] um he says I that he shall speak in my
[1:28:01] name I will require it
[1:28:04] of him amen it says but the prophet
[1:28:08] which shall presume to speak a word in
[1:28:10] my name which I have not commanded him
[1:28:12] to speak or that shall speak in the name
[1:28:14] of other gods even that Prophet shall
[1:28:16] die so now this is important so here
[1:28:18] comes a prophet saying God told me thus
[1:28:20] and thus and thus and thus then if it
[1:28:22] doesn't line up with what the other
[1:28:23] prophets have already said and if it and
[1:28:26] and what he says doesn't come to pass
[1:28:28] that Prophet shall what
[1:28:32] and it wasn't that God was going to
[1:28:34] strike him dead they were to all gather
[1:28:35] they would all find that man and stone
[1:28:37] him that's that Prophet had to die
[1:28:39] that's that was that was listen you
[1:28:42] didn't mess around with God's word oh I
[1:28:45] wonder what God would think about this
[1:28:46] generation today with all these
[1:28:48] preachers going around and they're all
[1:28:49] claiming the same Bible and they're
[1:28:51] saying you can be homosexual they say
[1:28:53] you can be transgender they say that you
[1:28:55] can and it don't matter that God you
[1:28:56] don't you know you can dress however you
[1:28:58] want to dress you can do whatever you
[1:28:59] want to do and the Bible's already said
[1:29:02] that homosexual is wrong
[1:29:05] wearing man's girls wearing man's
[1:29:07] apparels wrong
[1:29:09] and a preacher if he comes in and
[1:29:11] preaches anything contrary than what the
[1:29:14] prophets before us has already said
[1:29:17] in the Bible days what would be
[1:29:19] happening
[1:29:21] they would be pronounced to death oh
[1:29:26] there'd be a lot of preachers dying
[1:29:28] today amen there'd be a lot of preachers
[1:29:30] so so we we want to do that now so then
[1:29:34] the Bible says the 21st verse if thou
[1:29:37] say in your heart how shall we know
[1:29:41] what is the word which the Lord hath not
[1:29:43] spoken
[1:29:45] and here he tells so he's asking now if
[1:29:47] you're wanting to know well how do I
[1:29:49] know what's right and what's wrong how
[1:29:51] do I know which prophet to listen to
[1:29:52] what what am I supposed to do he's just
[1:29:55] told us that since you asked you said
[1:29:59] let not God speak to us less lest we die
[1:30:01] because we're scared the the great
[1:30:03] Pillar of Fire and the thunderings we
[1:30:05] don't want you speaking anymore
[1:30:07] send us a prophet he says all right I'll
[1:30:10] raise up a prophet
[1:30:11] but if you don't listen to that prophet
[1:30:17] then you will have to answer because
[1:30:21] that Prophet has the Living Word the
[1:30:23] discerner of the heart he's the one that
[1:30:26] has it all and one day his words will
[1:30:29] become a sword to you
[1:30:31] amen now I want you to listen he's going
[1:30:34] to say now how do I know what's right
[1:30:36] and what's wrong 22nd verse when a
[1:30:38] prophet speaks in the name of the Lord
[1:30:41] and if the thing follow not nor come to
[1:30:45] pass that is the thing which the Lord
[1:30:47] hath not spoken but the prophet had
[1:30:49] spoken presumptuously Thou shalt not be
[1:30:53] afraid of him so if a prophet prophesies
[1:30:58] and it comes to pass that is God
[1:31:01] speaking through that Prophet it's that
[1:31:04] Living Word listen folks if that great
[1:31:07] Pillar of Fire
[1:31:09] comes down to a prophet the all-knowing
[1:31:13] God can give details addresses can tell
[1:31:17] what you ate this morning can tell what
[1:31:20] you're going to do tomorrow morning that
[1:31:23] logos that knows all things endlessly
[1:31:27] is the one that talks to the prophets
[1:31:31] so you got to profit that there and God
[1:31:33] and he can't he's just guessing around
[1:31:35] all the time you can know that the
[1:31:37] pillar of fire has not appeared to him
[1:31:40] amen
[1:31:42] all right so so that this is because
[1:31:45] this is something that we want to know
[1:31:47] now
[1:31:48] so it's good it's good to know that's
[1:31:50] the reason why we're not just listening
[1:31:52] and uh how why do we believe brother
[1:31:54] Brandon to be a prophet because the
[1:31:56] pillar of fire or God's promised in the
[1:31:59] Bible that he would come the pillar of
[1:32:01] fire came down in this day and prophecy
[1:32:04] after prophecy after prophecy showed
[1:32:08] that God was with brother Branham and
[1:32:12] yet god brother Branham did not use that
[1:32:16] for a following
[1:32:18] amen he says if you love me
[1:32:23] love the Bible
[1:32:25] amen so brother Branham taught us to go
[1:32:29] back to the Bible and to believe it the
[1:32:32] way God wrote it
[1:32:35] amen so so that's what we're doing now
[1:32:38] all right so and and now a prophet is a
[1:32:41] special man no you you can't call
[1:32:43] yourself a prophetess I can't call
[1:32:45] myself a prophet it's not anyone who
[1:32:48] claims to be a prophet the Bible says
[1:32:50] they're in to Jeremiah uh and and you
[1:32:53] can write this down because we don't
[1:32:54] have time to keep looking at scripture
[1:32:55] here but Jeremiah 1 and 4 amen and
[1:32:59] through 10 it says Jeremiah before I
[1:33:03] fall v i ordained thee to be a prophet
[1:33:07] amen the specially built men as first
[1:33:12] Samuel 3 and 19 write it down it says
[1:33:15] and Samuel grew and the Lord was with
[1:33:17] him and did not let none did let none of
[1:33:21] his words fall to the ground amen so a
[1:33:26] prophet is a specially built man now so
[1:33:29] we we find that Jesus was the prophet
[1:33:33] of prophets
[1:33:36] he was the god prophet in the beginning
[1:33:38] was the word the word was with God the
[1:33:41] Word was God he was the light the light
[1:33:44] of men and it was made flesh and dwelt
[1:33:48] Among Us
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:51] so the word of words
[1:33:54] the prophet God the logos was now living
[1:33:58] bodily fully completely amen all the
[1:34:03] godhead of God was living in that body
[1:34:07] of Jesus Christ
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:10] Hallelujah and he is the image of the
[1:34:13] invisible God
[1:34:14] now
[1:34:15] so this now how many how many is
[1:34:18] following me so far
[1:34:20] now the beautiful part
[1:34:23] is the son of man is to be revealed
[1:34:27] there's been special prophecy
[1:34:29] that that logos Prophet God would be
[1:34:34] revealed to us in this seventh Church
[1:34:37] age
[1:34:38] right before Jesus comes now now this is
[1:34:43] this is especially important and
[1:34:46] especially as we're dealing with out of
[1:34:48] his mouth comes as sharp two-edged sword
[1:34:51] because uh remember the prophet God is a
[1:34:57] discerner he's all-knowing and he can he
[1:35:01] can foretell when he says as it was in
[1:35:04] the days of Sodom so shall it be in our
[1:35:08] day amen what was it Prophet God coming
[1:35:12] in a body
[1:35:14] and Discerning he was telling Abram that
[1:35:17] Sodom is fixing to burn
[1:35:19] he was also telling Abram that Sarah is
[1:35:24] has been waiting on a child so he knows
[1:35:27] her past
[1:35:28] he also tells Abram or Abraham that she
[1:35:33] is going to have that child according to
[1:35:37] the time of life
[1:35:38] so it is a prophet standing there in
[1:35:42] front of Abraham reading their past
[1:35:46] telling them their future and then also
[1:35:50] saying that Sodom is fixing to be
[1:35:53] destroyed
[1:35:54] and the Bible says he would send us the
[1:35:59] son of man the he says in the revealing
[1:36:02] this would be the logos
[1:36:05] coming
[1:36:06] so personal in this day to declare
[1:36:11] the end time signs
[1:36:14] show us what we have been waiting on
[1:36:17] where the church Ages come and also
[1:36:19] declare what our future is
[1:36:23] hallelujah amen now now this is this is
[1:36:27] good because
[1:36:29] when brother Branham in the opening of
[1:36:31] the seals brother random was torn up and
[1:36:33] so he was saying man am I going to die
[1:36:36] with the vision and I I just don't see
[1:36:38] how I can miss it and what did God do
[1:36:41] when he went up to the when he went up
[1:36:43] to the canyon and he was he was Sabina
[1:36:45] Canyon then he was praying and it had
[1:36:47] his hands up in the air and he and he's
[1:36:50] saying Lord my heart is so troubled this
[1:36:53] Vision it showed it showed seven dots
[1:36:56] from the sky coming down and as they
[1:36:58] come in to me they were the Angels they
[1:37:01] picked me up there was an explosion all
[1:37:04] of this stuff was going on and he's and
[1:37:07] and he says
[1:37:08] I don't understand this and he went and
[1:37:11] told the church three or four months
[1:37:13] before it actually happened he goes up
[1:37:15] to the church and he tells him is this
[1:37:16] the time end times sir is this the sign
[1:37:19] of the end and and and you kids you kids
[1:37:22] would enjoy it I think every one of us
[1:37:23] would would enjoy going back and
[1:37:25] listening and he's asking what does this
[1:37:27] mean am I going to die does this mean
[1:37:30] that that that there's that there's
[1:37:33] another messenger coming this is he's
[1:37:34] asking the questions and and so he he
[1:37:38] he's saying I believe it has something
[1:37:40] to do with those seven or no Thunders
[1:37:42] and so he says is this the time for this
[1:37:46] to happen well he's there in Sabina
[1:37:48] Canyon or he's over in Arizona and he
[1:37:51] and he's and he's hunting and and um and
[1:37:54] and and just like the vision it said he
[1:37:57] had already forgot about the vision but
[1:37:59] they were out there looking for for for
[1:38:00] Hogs and hunting with some other
[1:38:02] brothers and um and so as he was as he
[1:38:07] saw some Hogs uh going around this
[1:38:09] Canyon here he he had stopped to take a
[1:38:12] break and he had pulled a little a
[1:38:14] little a burr Little Bull header off of
[1:38:16] his trousers her his pants and as he
[1:38:20] threw it down and as he as he threw it
[1:38:23] down there was this great explosion just
[1:38:26] exactly like the vision said what
[1:38:30] happened
[1:38:31] it would Justice and brother Branham had
[1:38:33] already told us three months earlier
[1:38:37] that this was going to happen
[1:38:39] but he thought that he might die
[1:38:42] and so so here it came and and and uh
[1:38:46] ma'am the it he says he says it rocks
[1:38:49] the canyon I mean a big old explosion
[1:38:52] these angels swept down picked him up
[1:38:55] and says go back to Jeffersonville for
[1:38:58] the opening of those Seven Seals
[1:39:01] okay well so brother Brandon was asking
[1:39:02] now what what is all of this what is all
[1:39:04] of this about so he's up there at the
[1:39:06] canyon up to Sabina he's got his hands
[1:39:08] up in there and he's saying Lord what is
[1:39:10] what does all of this mean what's going
[1:39:11] on and all of a sudden a sword
[1:39:15] appears in his hand
[1:39:18] the sword he's he's looking at this
[1:39:20] sword and he says he's sort of scared of
[1:39:21] a sword and um and maybe I've and maybe
[1:39:25] I've got it here
[1:39:27] um
[1:39:27] praise the Lord
[1:39:32] he says
[1:39:35] um
[1:39:41] he says that someone went West wondering
[1:39:43] what was going to happen one day I got a
[1:39:46] call from the Lord and I told my wife I
[1:39:48] said honey I'm probably my work is over
[1:39:50] I don't I he says I didn't know
[1:39:53] God has probably finished with me now
[1:39:55] I'll be going home you you go get with
[1:39:58] Billy and take the children God will
[1:40:00] make make a way for for you somehow and
[1:40:04] go on and just live true to God see that
[1:40:07] the children get their school through
[1:40:09] school and raise them in the admonition
[1:40:10] of God she said bill you don't know that
[1:40:12] that's true he said no or I said no but
[1:40:16] but a man couldn't survive that one
[1:40:18] morning the Lord woke me up and said get
[1:40:21] up there Sabina Canyon and I took a
[1:40:23] piece of paper in my Bible and the wife
[1:40:25] said where are you going I said I don't
[1:40:27] know I I'll tell you when I come back I
[1:40:30] went up in the canyon climbed plumb up
[1:40:32] where the Eagles was flying around and I
[1:40:34] was watching some deer standing there
[1:40:36] and I knelt down to pray raised up my
[1:40:38] hands and a sword struck my hand and I
[1:40:41] looked around and I thought what's that
[1:40:43] I'm not beside myself I here here is
[1:40:47] that sword in my hand bright shiny
[1:40:49] glistening in the sun I said there's not
[1:40:52] people in in miles of me yeah way up
[1:40:56] here in this Canyon where could that
[1:40:58] come from and a voice said that's the
[1:41:01] king sword and I said a king nights a
[1:41:05] man with a sword and he The Voice came
[1:41:09] back and said not eat not a king sword
[1:41:13] but the king's sword the word of the
[1:41:18] Lord
[1:41:19] he said fear not it's only the third
[1:41:22] pool it's the Vindication of your
[1:41:26] ministry amen
[1:41:28] now amen so he's now he's saying he's
[1:41:32] showing us now now we're getting to to
[1:41:34] to out of his mouth comes a sharp
[1:41:40] to Ed's sword
[1:41:42] now the word of God has always been
[1:41:46] spoke All Through The Seven Ages we are
[1:41:48] all built upon the word of the Lord
[1:41:50] Seven seers
[1:41:52] giving the Revelation for each of those
[1:41:56] seven periods
[1:41:57] but it's the seventh one that was
[1:42:00] declared that the mystery would be
[1:42:04] finished
[1:42:07] they didn't know the story they didn't
[1:42:10] know what what it was all about they
[1:42:12] were just simply following the the the
[1:42:15] the the spirit of the Lord for their age
[1:42:17] but we are the consummation of it all
[1:42:21] y'all understand
[1:42:23] so God raised up brother Branham he
[1:42:28] raised up brother Branham to bring the
[1:42:31] word to its completion in our hearts
[1:42:35] so that we can understand
[1:42:39] what he's been doing
[1:42:42] why
[1:42:44] why would God do that to us any of you
[1:42:46] young people why would God do that to us
[1:42:50] and not the others
[1:42:55] any guesses
[1:42:57] amen
[1:42:59] old people
[1:43:03] huh
[1:43:04] well for the elect but so were The Seven
[1:43:07] Ages they were the elect
[1:43:12] huh
[1:43:15] it is the final age
[1:43:17] yeah we're that final age so he's kept
[1:43:21] the cover
[1:43:22] over the Masterpiece you're not the only
[1:43:25] one part of the Masterpiece Seven Ages
[1:43:27] his Masterpiece is the church
[1:43:31] the Redemption we are part of the church
[1:43:35] we're no better than the others that
[1:43:38] than the Apostle Paul or the fifth age
[1:43:40] or any other where but we are the
[1:43:43] privileged ones that God unveils himself
[1:43:48] to to show what his plan has been the
[1:43:51] whole time
[1:43:54] huh
[1:43:57] that's right we are that fullness of
[1:44:00] time that was to come so he put it he
[1:44:04] put it in Mysteries and symbols
[1:44:08] if God didn't put those in Mysteries and
[1:44:10] symbols
[1:44:12] and if everyone knew if God had showed
[1:44:14] at the beginning okay there's going to
[1:44:16] be 2 000 years there's going to be seven
[1:44:18] Church ages there's going to be 2 000
[1:44:21] years there's going to be a lot of
[1:44:22] trouble a lot of Heartache that's going
[1:44:24] but the Rapture is not going to take
[1:44:25] place until the very last
[1:44:28] brother Branham says all of these others
[1:44:31] would have died
[1:44:32] just thinking well it's not for our day
[1:44:35] but the way it was everyone was
[1:44:38] expecting the coming of the Lord for
[1:44:40] their day
[1:44:41] their day they died in anticipation and
[1:44:45] they had to die in anticipation because
[1:44:47] it was that anticipation or that faith
[1:44:49] that would raise them up with us at the
[1:44:52] last
[1:44:53] is that right so here we stand today
[1:44:57] amen with this Word of Promise now you
[1:45:01] say now what does this what what does
[1:45:03] this really do for me well brother
[1:45:07] Branham after the opening of the seals
[1:45:09] he began to say things like this he says
[1:45:13] I want I want to say one more thing
[1:45:16] closely now don't miss this how striking
[1:45:18] the seventh angel which is the messenger
[1:45:21] of the seventh seal his message and he
[1:45:25] says and the revelations 10 was the
[1:45:28] seventh seal he says on another place he
[1:45:32] says now the hidden Mystery of
[1:45:35] Revelations 10 1-7 is the last message
[1:45:39] to the last Church age which fulfills
[1:45:43] exactly Revelation 17 30 the day when
[1:45:47] the son of man shall be revealed now
[1:45:49] that might not mean a lot to it might
[1:45:52] not you know for a lot of might think
[1:45:54] well I don't understand that what he's
[1:45:55] doing is he's going back and pointing it
[1:45:58] to scripture that this is a prophecy
[1:46:00] this is a prophecy this is a prophecy
[1:46:02] and he's wanting you to catch what this
[1:46:05] sword means he's want you to see it amen
[1:46:08] now
[1:46:10] he says the seventh seal brings him back
[1:46:12] to Earth the lamb come took the book out
[1:46:16] of the right hand of him sat down and
[1:46:18] claimed what he owed uh what he owned
[1:46:21] what he had redeemed it's always been
[1:46:23] that third pool now three is perfection
[1:46:26] the ministry came to its Perfection when
[1:46:28] it reproduced Christ again in natural
[1:46:31] among human beings as was predicted in
[1:46:34] the days of Sodom in the days of lot he
[1:46:38] says I've Got My Mind Set On this
[1:46:41] message that's that third pool and what
[1:46:45] was that third pool that was that great
[1:46:47] sword he says that's the one I must be
[1:46:51] loyal and reverent to
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] now what what is God doing
[1:46:59] Hallelujah the son of man
[1:47:01] the king's sword
[1:47:04] so we're finding the word the discerner
[1:47:07] we've got these here that are standing
[1:47:08] now we're we're linking the the message
[1:47:12] of our day to a sword he's standing in
[1:47:16] there this mysterious one when he opens
[1:47:19] his mouth amen out of his mouth comes a
[1:47:24] sharp two-edged sword y'all remember
[1:47:26] what we've done the last time out of his
[1:47:29] mouth was The Voice
[1:47:31] of many Waters what did we find the many
[1:47:34] Waters was
[1:47:36] what was the mini Waters
[1:47:39] it was the word of God being preached
[1:47:43] throughout the entire Seven Ages those
[1:47:46] were the seven seers those were the
[1:47:48] preachers and that was the bride that
[1:47:51] was living out the word of God in their
[1:47:54] day
[1:47:55] are you understanding so now let's put
[1:47:57] it all together let's put it together
[1:47:58] here is The Living Voices of all of the
[1:48:03] ages
[1:48:05] here is the seventh Church
[1:48:08] with a with a sword in their mouth
[1:48:13] declaring the mystery of God
[1:48:17] declaring through faith
[1:48:20] I believe that promise
[1:48:24] now
[1:48:26] all right now uh now y'all's been
[1:48:28] awfully quiet here tonight
[1:48:30] amen uh are you understanding what I'm
[1:48:34] saying or no
[1:48:35] any questions now make sure on these
[1:48:37] Wednesday nights follow the hand up or
[1:48:40] say something you're welcome to do so
[1:48:42] praise the Lord
[1:48:43] Ephesians 6 and 17.
[1:48:47] part of the armor of God
[1:48:49] he says
[1:48:53] let me get to it here
[1:48:57] it says
[1:49:00] and take the helmet of salvation
[1:49:04] and the sword of the spirit which is
[1:49:09] what
[1:49:12] right
[1:49:13] now here we go
[1:49:14] and I'm closing this this is my last
[1:49:17] point
[1:49:19] what good was this what is this message
[1:49:21] it's the sword
[1:49:25] what is the word it's the sword of the
[1:49:29] spirit
[1:49:30] what does this why is it important for
[1:49:34] us to have this understanding today
[1:49:37] because perfect word brings perfect
[1:49:40] faith
[1:49:42] hallelujah amen
[1:49:47] we've got we're going to defeat Devils
[1:49:51] that the other ages never did could
[1:49:53] defeat
[1:49:55] what is the last one that the Apostle
[1:49:57] Paul says that is still haunting
[1:49:58] everybody
[1:50:00] death
[1:50:01] death
[1:50:03] but this word
[1:50:05] is greater than death
[1:50:08] this is God saying listen I've saved
[1:50:12] this last not to puffy up to say well
[1:50:14] I'm a message believer I follow brother
[1:50:16] Branham
[1:50:17] but we're to take that message
[1:50:20] that is God's that is God Hallelujah in
[1:50:24] other words
[1:50:25] it's God unlocking the gun cabinet
[1:50:29] amen and inside the gun cabinet is the
[1:50:33] rifle
[1:50:34] and the bullets
[1:50:36] and you can go out there amen and and
[1:50:40] and and get your game or get what can
[1:50:43] you say man and and this is this is what
[1:50:47] what God is saying I'm giving you what
[1:50:49] it takes to defeat the enemy of your
[1:50:53] soul
[1:50:55] amen amen
[1:50:57] defeat the enemy of your soul so now now
[1:51:02] catch that Hallelujah he's going you you
[1:51:06] are you you're taking that sword of the
[1:51:09] spirit so why why was it now remember a
[1:51:12] lot of people put that in that seventh
[1:51:14] seal that sword that that that third
[1:51:17] pool all on brother Branham but remember
[1:51:19] when he unveiled when he unveiled the
[1:51:23] book then it was a command that you go
[1:51:26] pick up that sword
[1:51:28] you go take the book you eat the book
[1:51:31] because you must speak
[1:51:34] you are now speaking amen the sword of
[1:51:39] the spirit the word of God is in you is
[1:51:42] that right
[1:51:44] now those who have who have rejected
[1:51:46] that of course the Bible says that they
[1:51:48] might he says you you they'll be God
[1:51:52] will judge the secrets of men by Jesus
[1:51:55] Christ
[1:51:56] according to my uh according to my
[1:52:01] gospel amen brother uh the god there to
[1:52:06] the those that were holding the
[1:52:08] nicolaitanism in the Third Church age
[1:52:10] there in Revelations 2 and 16. it says
[1:52:12] repent or I will come unto thee quickly
[1:52:14] and fight against them with the sword of
[1:52:16] my mouth
[1:52:18] amen so you're either for him
[1:52:21] or you're against him is that right and
[1:52:24] so when he stands as judge he's going to
[1:52:27] he's he's going to judge the World
[1:52:31] by this message that has been brought to
[1:52:35] us
[1:52:36] he's going to judge the secrets of man
[1:52:39] according to this gospel is that right
[1:52:43] amen
[1:52:45] so the great Living Word will be there
[1:52:47] on that day
[1:52:49] amen I'm just a voice I'm an Earthly
[1:52:52] voice I'm a pastor I can only speak as I
[1:52:55] hear from him as I read it in his book
[1:52:57] as I listen to the seventh angel
[1:53:00] but the logos that has put the plan
[1:53:03] together he's ever living and he's here
[1:53:06] in our church he's here in our services
[1:53:08] he's here in our homes he's everywhere
[1:53:11] amen and he anoints us as we take this
[1:53:15] message he anoints that word he anoints
[1:53:19] it to our heart
[1:53:20] and we defeat the Devil we defeat cancer
[1:53:22] we defeat lupus we we defeat sin in our
[1:53:26] lives it's the Living Word
[1:53:29] are y'all hearing me it's that word that
[1:53:32] comes living through us that's why God
[1:53:34] sent us a prophet pointing to these and
[1:53:37] saying believe this put these on your
[1:53:39] lips amen
[1:53:42] Hallelujah well glory to God
[1:53:48] so the scripture says and musicians
[1:53:50] could come the scripture says they're in
[1:53:52] Revelations 19 that when he comes Amen
[1:53:55] on that on riding on the riding on the
[1:53:58] White Horse he's going to come with the
[1:54:01] word of whether with a sword out of his
[1:54:03] mouth and he's coming for judgment then
[1:54:06] but if you look there's also the armies
[1:54:09] going wide horses too that's you and me
[1:54:11] and we got swords too we've taken the
[1:54:14] word of the Lord and we defeat the enemy
[1:54:16] I'm so thankful for that today amen oh I
[1:54:21] love him do you do you love him with all
[1:54:23] of your heart
[1:54:25] amen
[1:54:29] all right so so any questions on what
[1:54:31] I've said here tonight amen
[1:54:34] any anything at all that
[1:54:37] that maybe I've I've left out for in
[1:54:39] that someone might think that I've left
[1:54:43] a little bit of confusion in or anything
[1:54:44] you want to add to this remember
[1:54:46] Wednesday nights amen is is just
[1:54:54] just easy nights for whoever to say
[1:54:56] whatever amen Bible study type deal
[1:55:00] praise the Lord
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:46] behind Christ
[1:55:50] why would be
[1:55:55] they're already just
[1:55:58] he laid his body down
[1:56:00] his body
[1:56:03] yeah well but but we are that the
[1:56:07] Judgment has come
[1:56:09] this this this truly what is taking
[1:56:12] place right now is the fulfilling what I
[1:56:15] preached tonight is the fulfilling of
[1:56:17] Revelations 12.
[1:56:19] they he says and they when Satan was
[1:56:22] cast down he had a short time on Earth
[1:56:24] and he's a key the accuser of their
[1:56:26] Brethren is here he says but they over
[1:56:29] they love not their life unto death and
[1:56:32] they overcome by the blood of the lamb
[1:56:34] and the word of their testimony so we
[1:56:36] are literally judging him now
[1:56:41] and what we understand when after this
[1:56:43] battle is over and we're caught up there
[1:56:47] is there is no more there there is there
[1:56:50] is no more of us having to answer uh
[1:56:53] uh because our sins have all been dealt
[1:56:56] with we will be judging the
[1:57:00] the serpent
[1:57:03] we when we when we come back now there
[1:57:06] will be a time now
[1:57:08] according to the teachings of Paul and
[1:57:11] the Book of Revelations that I I believe
[1:57:13] that there will be the rewards given
[1:57:15] it'll be the bank the banquet hall
[1:57:19] but that that is not
[1:57:21] um the Judgment seat
[1:57:23] I I believe the rewards are going to be
[1:57:27] there in that in that Thousand-Year
[1:57:28] honeymoon
[1:57:33] yeah no no no no no no no there's no
[1:57:35] judgment
[1:57:39] no
[1:57:41] no and the scripture is pretty uh it's
[1:57:44] pretty clear on it that the Apostle Paul
[1:57:47] says it's it's there's you're we're
[1:57:50] judged here by the gospel
[1:57:54] now and and when we get to it and then
[1:57:58] the rest of the Dead live not again for
[1:58:01] a thousand years after after the
[1:58:04] honeymoon then is when great and small
[1:58:08] and that's when we're not even in that
[1:58:11] part of it at all where but brother
[1:58:13] Bradham says they're in Revelation or in
[1:58:15] Matthew
[1:58:16] um 25 where he's talking about giving
[1:58:19] the um
[1:58:21] uh
[1:58:22] uh
[1:58:23] separating as a Shepherd the sheep and
[1:58:26] the goats he says now remember he says
[1:58:29] as a Shepherd this is not the shepherd
[1:58:31] this has nothing to do with the elect we
[1:58:34] have already
[1:58:36] we we are there with him this is at the
[1:58:40] second Reser or this is at the second
[1:58:41] judgment the second Resurrection should
[1:58:44] I say and so this is when he's he's he's
[1:58:48] talking to the foolish virgins he's
[1:58:51] talking to the uh those that have been
[1:58:54] good to the bride that is what Matthew
[1:58:57] 25 is dealing with
[1:58:59] some if you don't if you don't listen uh
[1:59:02] you know if you don't take that in
[1:59:03] account according to what brother
[1:59:04] Branham and again it took it took a
[1:59:06] prophet to bring that out to us
[1:59:09] and so a lot of people look at that and
[1:59:11] say well well here we are at the second
[1:59:13] Resurrection you know the Sheep are
[1:59:15] being no no it has nothing to do
[1:59:18] that has nothing to do with the bride
[1:59:21] that that judgment
[1:59:22] does that make sense for everybody
[1:59:27] yes that's right that's right that word
[1:59:31] is taking us we are we are submitting
[1:59:34] ourselves to that word right now and
[1:59:37] defeating the devil in our lives that's
[1:59:41] why we must fight fight
[1:59:45] that devil amen
[1:59:47] amen any other questions
