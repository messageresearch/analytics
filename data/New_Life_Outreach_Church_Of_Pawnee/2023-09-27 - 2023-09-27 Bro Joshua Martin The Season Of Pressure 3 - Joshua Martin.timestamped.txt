[38:17] all this lonely rose that I've traveled
[38:23] there was Jesus
[38:26] thank you Lord
[38:30] with the life I built
[38:32] in the life I feel kid crash into the
[38:36] ground
[38:39] and the friends I have were nowhere to
[38:43] be found
[38:46] could see a thing but I can't see it
[38:50] tonight I can see it
[38:53] there was Jesus
[38:55] [Music]
[38:57] there I was Jesus
[39:00] in The Waiting
[39:02] [Music]
[39:11] pieces
[39:14] [Music]
[39:28] there was Jesus
[39:32] [Music]
[39:35] there was Jesus
[39:37] [Music]
[39:40] hey man you're thankful for that this
[39:42] evening
[39:45] every step of the way he's been with us
[39:48] amen reminds me of that little poem that
[39:51] brother Branham quoted the footsteps on
[39:54] the sands of time he said Lord you left
[39:56] me there's only one set of footprints
[39:58] there said no I didn't leave you that's
[40:01] when I picked you up and carried you
[40:03] through the hard time and I'm so
[40:04] grateful that he's been with us every
[40:06] step of the way when we didn't feel him
[40:08] he was there when we couldn't see him he
[40:11] was there are you thankful for that amen
[40:14] if you have your Bibles
[40:15] let's turn to Psalms 3 and 1.
[40:18] then Galatians 6 and 8.
[40:22] you're gonna have to bear with me
[40:23] tonight I've been struggling with my
[40:25] voice so I I won't keep you alone
[40:27] tonight
[40:28] um I'll just say a few things here
[40:31] try to and try to encourage I'll
[40:34] discontinue you on my thought on
[40:35] pressure
[40:36] and
[40:38] I believe you're living in a great hour
[40:40] of pressure amen the devil's coming
[40:42] every different direction but you look
[40:44] at Psalms three and one a Psalm of David
[40:47] when he fled from Absalom his son Lord
[40:49] how are they increased that troubled me
[40:52] many are they that rise up against me
[40:54] many there be which say of my soul there
[40:57] was no help for him in God but thou O
[41:01] Lord are the shield for me my glory and
[41:03] the lifter of my head I Cried unto the
[41:06] Lord with my voice and he heard me out
[41:09] of his holy heel I laid me down and
[41:12] slept I awaken for the Lord sustained me
[41:15] I would not be afraid of ten thousands
[41:17] of people that have set themselves
[41:20] against me round about arise O Lord Save
[41:23] Me O God for thou was smitten all my
[41:26] enemies upon the cheekbone thou has
[41:28] broken the teeth of the ungodly
[41:30] salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy
[41:33] blessing is upon thy people Salah
[41:36] the Galatians 6 and 8 and I like how
[41:39] David is putting it he's in a hard time
[41:42] he's surrounded but I Cried unto the
[41:44] Lord with my voice he wasn't ashamed
[41:47] about it but he knew he was in a
[41:49] desperate spot where the pressure was
[41:51] all around him he needed a delivery work
[41:53] and he looked at Galatians 6 and 8 for
[41:56] he that soweth to his flesh shall of the
[41:59] flesh reap corruption but he thus soweth
[42:01] to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
[42:03] Everlasting and let us not be weary in
[42:06] well-doing for a due season we shall
[42:09] reap if we faint not amen can be about
[42:12] our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly
[42:14] Father
[42:15] Lord I'm going to thank you for your
[42:17] grace and your mercy that you've given
[42:19] us Lord God as we fill your presence
[42:21] here tonight Lord we've sang songs of
[42:23] worship Lord Lord have dedicated the
[42:25] service unto your hands God I ask that
[42:28] you and be in this part of the service
[42:29] Lord You see I've been struggling with
[42:31] my voice I ask that you would help me
[42:33] Lord help my voice to clear up father I
[42:36] ask that you would speak tonight Lord
[42:37] you know the needs of the people father
[42:39] Lord be laid into your hands if you ask
[42:41] these things in your precious name amen
[42:44] you may be seated
[42:46] and the Bible says don't get weary in
[42:48] well-doing and I believe all of us can
[42:50] say we've been weary before there's been
[42:52] times where we've taken blow after blow
[42:54] after blow and it just feels like we
[42:56] can't take it anymore where it feels
[42:58] like we're just going to give up but the
[43:00] Apostle Paul would say the messenger of
[43:03] Satan buffets me and the word Buffett is
[43:05] blow after blow after blow and the Bible
[43:08] says the Apostle Paul asked the Lord
[43:11] three times take this away from him
[43:13] deliver me from this and the Lord spoke
[43:16] back to the Apostle Paul and says but my
[43:19] grace is sufficient for thee my weakness
[43:22] your weakness my in your weakness my
[43:24] strength can be displayed and even
[43:27] though he has taken blow after blow
[43:29] after blow God has given him a security
[43:33] that I have not left you there by
[43:35] yourself but I'm going to carry you
[43:37] through this opposition I'm going to
[43:39] carry you through and you see the
[43:41] pressure is out to make you wearing it's
[43:43] out to make you tired it's out to beat
[43:46] you down film and you remember what the
[43:47] Apostle Paul says the fire is going to
[43:50] try every man's work to see what sort it
[43:53] is so even though you're built on the
[43:56] right foundation there's still going to
[43:58] be pressure that is going to come after
[44:00] your building going to come after your
[44:02] life and that is the time that we need
[44:05] somebody to carry us through the Bible
[44:08] says in Proverbs 24 and 10 it felt faint
[44:11] in the day of adversary thy strength is
[44:14] small so he's saying if you get weary in
[44:17] the time of adversity you're not going
[44:20] to have strength to press on and I think
[44:22] mine Lord help us not to get weary and
[44:25] if we are weary there is somebody here
[44:28] that can pick us up oh my so we see what
[44:31] the Bible says that our adversary is the
[44:34] devil and he is roaming two and four
[44:36] seeking whom he may devire and so we're
[44:39] not on this Earth powerless and by
[44:42] yourself but God has given us a strength
[44:44] but we see what the devil is out after
[44:46] you look at Luke 22 and 31 and the Lord
[44:49] said Simon Simon behold Satan hath
[44:53] desired to have you that he might sift
[44:55] you as wheat but I have prayed for thee
[44:58] that thy faith shall not and when thou
[45:00] are converted strengthen thy Brethren so
[45:03] the the Jesus tells us what the devil is
[45:07] after he's willing to sift us and that
[45:09] word sift is to shake and that's what
[45:11] they would do with the wheat is they
[45:13] would beat it down and begin to shake it
[45:15] and then all of the shaft and the husk
[45:17] will begin to fall off and so the Bible
[45:20] is saying that the devil is coming and
[45:22] trying to shake you and he's trying to
[45:25] take the faith out of your life but I
[45:27] like how the Bible puts that but I have
[45:29] prayed for thee that you lose not your
[45:32] faith and now that is an encouraging
[45:34] thought that in the midst of the shaking
[45:36] in the midst of the this discouragement
[45:39] God is for Jesus has already prayed a
[45:42] prayer for us though we keep our faith
[45:44] in the midst of the pressure and I don't
[45:47] believe that he just prayed for Peter
[45:49] but every one of his sons every one of
[45:52] his daughters he has prayed for him that
[45:54] she will that you will press through the
[45:57] opposition and not come out wearing but
[45:59] come out stronger than ever before Oh my
[46:03] Jesus is telling Peter Satan is after
[46:05] you but I prayed that you will keep your
[46:08] faith who am I that you will be
[46:10] separated from your faith because we
[46:12] know if you lose your faith you cannot
[46:15] operate the supernatural God can heal
[46:17] God can deliver God can fill with the
[46:19] Holy Ghost but with thou faith we can
[46:22] never operate the supernatural we can
[46:24] see others be healed we can see others
[46:27] touched but without faith personally for
[46:30] me we can never see the Supernatural and
[46:33] so that's what the devil is after is to
[46:35] take your faith away but Christ has
[46:38] already prayed for us but you notice
[46:40] where the Branham was saying all hell
[46:42] has turned loose and all the guns of
[46:45] hell is pointed out us and that is a
[46:48] dark picture but he says at the same
[46:50] time that all of hell is turned loose
[46:53] all of Heaven is turned loose and so
[46:55] there is a power that in the midst of
[46:58] uncertainty there is something that is
[47:01] keeping us and pushing us forward but
[47:03] the prayer must say in the Lord kindly
[47:05] checked me oh and that's a purpose in my
[47:07] heart then if he would help me that I
[47:09] was going to do different and as just as
[47:12] you start to do something for God then
[47:14] expect all of the guns of Hell to turn
[47:17] right on you see he says just as you
[47:20] start to do something for God then all
[47:22] of hell is going to turn loose on him
[47:25] and so that is a good sign when you're
[47:27] under pressure because that means you're
[47:30] doing something right you can look at
[47:32] the scarecrows I know it's a it's
[47:33] something that we've heard before but a
[47:36] scarecrow ain't in the middle of the
[47:37] desert it ain't in the middle of a
[47:39] pastor but a scarecrow is in the middle
[47:42] of a farm in the middle of something
[47:45] that has a life in it and so if you see
[47:47] a scarecrow you know there is a life
[47:49] somewhere you know there was a
[47:51] sustaining power somewhere so all the
[47:54] pressure is letting you know there's a
[47:56] life on the inside your faith ain't
[47:59] being shaken you ever lost your
[48:01] confidence but you've got life on the
[48:04] inside you might be shaken the devil
[48:07] might be trying to sift you but you've
[48:09] got a security there's an acre a million
[48:12] signs you see the Bible would say in
[48:14] Isaiah 40 and 30. even the youth shall
[48:17] faint and be weary and the young men
[48:19] shall utterly fall and so trying to
[48:22] trying to go through the pressure in
[48:25] human strength we are never going to
[48:28] make it because the Bible says even the
[48:30] youth is going to be weary that's a
[48:33] natural strength this is a day of
[48:35] weariness everybody's tired you wake up
[48:37] in the morning and you're tired you're
[48:39] eating lunch during the middle of the
[48:41] day you're tired they don't seem like
[48:44] you can get rest because we're
[48:45] constantly tired it's a spirit that is
[48:48] attacking the body of Christ trying to
[48:51] make you weary but that's not just
[48:53] happening in the natural but in the
[48:55] Supernatural the devil's coming with
[48:57] blower after blow after blow trying to
[49:00] make you weary where you can't have
[49:03] faith to believe when you can't have
[49:05] faith to persevere but I say this
[49:07] morning that Christ has already prayed
[49:10] for us that we lose not our faith don't
[49:12] give up don't get weary in well-doing
[49:15] but withstand the pressure there's a
[49:18] victory on the other side of the
[49:20] pressure there's a there's an overcoming
[49:22] power on the other side of the pressure
[49:25] if you can just withstand the pressure
[49:28] the supernatural because we know any
[49:31] time that the Supernatural is close by
[49:33] the devil's going to come and try to
[49:36] pressure you out of it we can look at uh
[49:38] as a Zacchaeus the short man that climb
[49:41] the wall or climb that the climb a tree
[49:42] the Bible says that he desired to see
[49:46] Jesus and so there was a desire there to
[49:48] see the supernatural but the Bible says
[49:51] he could not see him because the Press
[49:53] was too great and so the pressure was
[49:56] trying to keep him away from saying the
[49:59] supernatural the pressure was trying to
[50:01] keep him from seeing a living God but if
[50:04] since there was a desire there he was
[50:07] willing to press and the Bible says that
[50:09] he found a tree he knew that Christ was
[50:12] going to walk by that way so he found he
[50:15] found a position where he knew that
[50:18] Christ was going to combine oh man I
[50:21] think a good position to see Christ is
[50:24] the praise and the worship even when you
[50:26] don't feel like it praise God even when
[50:29] you're tired praise God even when you're
[50:31] weary praise God cause that puts you in
[50:34] a position to see the supernatural
[50:36] Hallelujah and the Bible says that
[50:39] Christ walked by and stop and says
[50:42] Zacchaeus come down for today I will
[50:45] abide I was a will in your house but you
[50:48] notice I know we've talked about this
[50:49] before he the Bible says he was going to
[50:52] abide in Zacchaeus house but he left
[50:54] that day the body of Christ left the
[50:58] house of Zacchaeus but the supernatural
[51:00] was there to remain we might not got the
[51:03] physical body of Jesus Christ dwelling
[51:06] in the church to willing in our homes to
[51:09] well again our lives but the
[51:10] supernatural that we've pressed through
[51:12] to obtain is dwelling in every pressure
[51:16] that it is dwelling in everything that
[51:19] we go through oh my see what happens
[51:22] when you get weary and start to faint
[51:25] it's hard to press on you know if you're
[51:28] if you're out running a marathon or
[51:29] playing sports or hiking in the
[51:31] mountains your legs get tired and your
[51:34] your mind is telling you to press on
[51:36] your mind is saying come on put it in
[51:39] the Foot In Front it take another step
[51:40] but since your legs are so wearing it's
[51:44] hard to put another foot in front or the
[51:46] other but if we can just get a
[51:48] refreshing drink of water or you know I
[51:51] was hiking up in the mountains one time
[51:53] in Arizona and I was wore out and tired
[51:55] but the guy that we was hiking with he
[51:57] packed a bunch of code apples
[51:59] and you know I love Apple Juice I love
[52:01] apples but once I ate that Apple there
[52:04] was a nourishment that come across my
[52:06] body it was something that my body was
[52:09] lacking my mind was telling me to move
[52:12] on but my body could not keep up because
[52:15] I was weary but there was a nourishment
[52:17] that could line my body oh Hallelujah
[52:20] lined my body up with my mind and I'm
[52:23] not talking about uh about a living by
[52:26] the mind but we've got faith inside of a
[52:29] heart that is telling us to move on the
[52:32] pressure I'm not talking about
[52:33] psychology but I'm talking about a
[52:36] supernatural whenever you're lower and
[52:38] you can't move you can't you don't feel
[52:40] like you can take another step there's
[52:42] an ingredient here the shame them the
[52:45] supernatural holy ghost that can come
[52:47] across your life one more time and that
[52:50] your body can obey your confession the
[52:53] sure body can obey the faith that is
[52:55] telling you to keep on hey the same time
[52:58] they give up they say take time to to
[53:00] give in and play dead this is time to
[53:03] March this is the time to go on we're at
[53:06] the end time this is the time for a
[53:08] rapturing generation this is the time to
[53:11] see your loved ones to see your body
[53:13] change the same time they give up but we
[53:15] need something to push us in that
[53:18] direction when we are wearing hey it's
[53:20] okay to get weary it's natural to get
[53:23] weary but but we can't stay in that
[53:25] state we gotta look for a solution hey
[53:28] you see too many people try to find
[53:31] something in natural resources when
[53:34] they're weary spiritually you know the
[53:36] Bible says now David says I looked you
[53:39] where my help comes from I look to the
[53:41] mountains where my help comes from he
[53:43] knew the one that anointed him the one
[53:46] that called him to be a king was the one
[53:49] he needed to fight when he was weary
[53:51] come on somebody you didn't Place
[53:54] yourself here you didn't call yourself
[53:56] to be here you're not here by accident
[53:58] but it was God that chose you to be here
[54:01] it was God that elected you to be here
[54:04] so whenever you are wearing sports ain't
[54:07] gonna lift you up when you are wearing
[54:09] love relationships ain't going to lift
[54:12] you up but you need the one that called
[54:15] you to come by your way up and lift you
[54:17] out of their weary shape
[54:20] hallelujah holy God can lift you up oh
[54:25] my David is saying I'm looking to the
[54:27] one that called me and placed me here
[54:30] that's where we need to put her eyes not
[54:32] on the things of the world not on
[54:34] emotions but I'm looking to the one that
[54:36] placed me here in the first place oh my
[54:40] you're seeing he's wanting you to get
[54:42] weary you can be a good boxer you can be
[54:44] strong and you can be fast but if you
[54:46] don't got endurance the other boxer is
[54:49] just going to wear you out if he's got
[54:51] more endurance than him he's just going
[54:53] to come at you and come at you and come
[54:55] at you and he may get hit once or twice
[54:58] but his endurance is pushing past your
[55:02] endurance your endurance and one dime
[55:04] there's gonna come a time where your
[55:06] strength is going to fail your speed is
[55:09] going to fail if he's got more endurance
[55:11] than you and I thought mine here we are
[55:14] we can we can be on fire with the things
[55:16] of God we can get the Holy Ghost and
[55:18] we're doing great but the devil's been
[55:20] on earth a lot longer than we have he's
[55:23] been studying your human nature for a
[55:26] long time and if we don't get if we
[55:28] don't get the endurance of the Holy
[55:30] Ghost day by day week by week month by
[55:33] month he's going to outlast us come on
[55:36] somebody we don't need just one feeling
[55:38] of the Holy Ghost but we need filling
[55:40] after filling after filling that we can
[55:43] last all the way till we step into her
[55:46] body change you see God has placed us
[55:49] here for a purpose and he said brother
[55:51] Branham says this
[55:53] he's looking for a time-tested memorials
[55:55] as he can say there's my servant I've
[55:58] tested him I've tried him I put him
[56:00] through like job he still proves a
[56:03] hundred percent God be merciful to us
[56:06] that we can take God at his word and be
[56:09] time tested memorials oh my God this
[56:12] place is here to reflect the other
[56:14] Kingdom you know I was listening to
[56:16] brother Branham and brother Branham was
[56:18] preaching on time tested memorials and
[56:20] he's talking about how the children of
[56:22] Israel they went across the Jordan River
[56:24] and as there was going across them their
[56:26] place stones and that was to be a
[56:28] memorial of the grace of God that was to
[56:31] be a memorial of the power of God and I
[56:34] thought I looked at the scripture and
[56:36] the scripture says you are lit Lively
[56:38] songs and so God ain't looking for a
[56:41] natural Memorial where he can point to
[56:43] and say there yeah the Jordan River
[56:45] that's where I delivered my people
[56:47] that's where I split the river that's
[56:50] where I set them free but he's wanting
[56:52] some human Stones human memorials where
[56:55] he can point to and say they was bound
[56:57] by drugs and I set them free they was
[57:00] bound by addictions and I set them free
[57:02] they've been in the midst of pressure
[57:05] and I've set them free I brought them
[57:08] through God is wanting some Lively
[57:10] stones that is a living a life above
[57:13] reproach living a life above the
[57:16] pressure you see we can say amen I
[57:18] believe we are the the memorials that
[57:21] God is looking for them but that don't
[57:23] make it easier to stand we still get
[57:25] weary we still get tired
[57:27] and I would think that David would know
[57:30] this feeling you know as my opening
[57:32] scripture says Lord how are they
[57:34] increased that tripled me many are they
[57:37] that rise up against me many that be
[57:40] would say on my soul there is no help
[57:43] for him in God and so he is saying him
[57:46] that there is many that is rising up
[57:48] against me many of them which are saying
[57:51] I've got no help from the Supernatural
[57:54] and David is speaking of the natural
[57:57] that there's human enemies coming
[57:59] against me but I'm speaking of the
[58:01] supernatural that the Supernatural is
[58:04] coming against the bride trying to wear
[58:07] you down but I think David has seen uh
[58:10] David is saying here that I'm amazed
[58:12] that everywhere I look that I'm troubled
[58:15] everywhere I look the enemy is after my
[58:19] soul and I thought Myers that's the way
[58:21] it is with the bride everywhere we look
[58:23] the devil is coming around every corner
[58:26] coming over every coming through every
[58:29] door trying to get us to get wearing and
[58:32] it seems like it'll hear that saying
[58:34] when it rains it pours and it seems like
[58:37] it's an endless amount of rain that is
[58:39] coming on your mind you know you get up
[58:41] your car breaks down and you go to work
[58:43] and something messes up how work or or
[58:46] you burn the supper you're getting ready
[58:48] for church and you're your children give
[58:50] food all over their dress clothes it's
[58:52] pressure trying to wear you down the
[58:55] devil's trying all he can do to wear
[58:58] down your street wear down your
[59:00] confidence wear you down but what I love
[59:03] about David is that if we can save all
[59:06] of his UPS we can see all of his downs
[59:09] we can see how God he was on the
[59:11] mountaintops and we could see him in The
[59:14] Valleys but through it all he was OB
[59:16] he's always saying Thou Art my shield
[59:19] you are my strong tower in the midst of
[59:23] every your position he was pointing back
[59:25] to the supernatural we concealed and he
[59:29] was selected by God himself when he was
[59:32] refused by his father his father was
[59:35] saying his to ready but then God would
[59:37] say I don't look up the outward
[59:40] appearance I look at the heart and so we
[59:43] can see that he is going through ups and
[59:46] downs we read about the people loving
[59:49] him so much that they would sing songs
[59:51] Saul has slayed his thousands but David
[59:54] has slayed us ten thousands but now it's
[59:57] the same people that is saying there is
[1:00:00] no help for him and God so he is saying
[1:00:03] where can I turn to because the same
[1:00:06] people that says I'm great is the same
[1:00:08] people that are saying I don't have help
[1:00:10] in God it was God that he slayed the
[1:00:13] Goliath it was through God that he
[1:00:15] slayed the giant but now the people is
[1:00:18] turning against him and says now you're
[1:00:20] being chased like a dog there's no help
[1:00:22] for him we're surrounding you but in the
[1:00:25] midst of it all he never lost his
[1:00:27] confidence every time he was going
[1:00:30] through a hard time he wasn't looking at
[1:00:33] what he achieved but he was looking up
[1:00:36] the one that anointed him
[1:00:38] I can only imagine that every time
[1:00:40] somebody else was trying to kill him he
[1:00:43] would think back whenever the messenger
[1:00:46] come to him whenever he was in the
[1:00:48] pasture and says the prophet wants to
[1:00:50] talk to you I'm sure he would just think
[1:00:52] and think my what an amazing time what
[1:00:55] it was like to come before the prophet
[1:00:58] and the prophet would pour the anointing
[1:01:00] girl upon his life he would think my
[1:01:03] that was a wonderful time but then he
[1:01:05] could stop and think mine is that
[1:01:07] anointing still with me or am I by
[1:01:10] myself my kingdom is against me the very
[1:01:13] Kingdom that I'm anointed to Reign is
[1:01:16] against me and then he could say yes my
[1:01:19] Help Cometh From The Lord the one that
[1:01:21] fitter the one that started this is
[1:01:24] going to finish it the one that anointed
[1:01:26] me to be king is going to help me remain
[1:01:30] as king and the same God that anointed
[1:01:32] you to be an overcomer is going to be
[1:01:35] here to make sure you fulfill your
[1:01:38] purpose yes you might be tired you might
[1:01:40] be weary you might be lower but just
[1:01:42] remember the Lord the one that called
[1:01:44] you the one that sharted this good work
[1:01:47] is going to be faithful to complete it
[1:01:50] he hasn't left you here by yourself but
[1:01:52] he's working on your life so that you
[1:01:55] can be a memorial
[1:01:57] oh my regard wants us to be a memorial
[1:02:02] David David would say this oh Lord Thou
[1:02:05] Art and show for me there's a reason why
[1:02:08] David would say it I lay down and slept
[1:02:11] how could he sleep whenever he was
[1:02:13] compassionate about With the Enemy how
[1:02:16] could you sleep Whenever there was
[1:02:18] somebody trying to take your soul
[1:02:19] somebody he says they're trying to eat
[1:02:22] my flesh they're coming trying to eat
[1:02:24] his flesh trying to destroy his alive
[1:02:26] but in the midst of this he lays down to
[1:02:29] sleep
[1:02:31] and I thought what guy in his right mind
[1:02:34] would do this you think that he would
[1:02:36] want to watch the approaching enemy he
[1:02:39] would want to watch but David is shaking
[1:02:41] if I if I'm awake I'm going to try to
[1:02:43] fight but he is my shield he's my
[1:02:46] buckler he's my strong tower if God is
[1:02:50] fighting for me I need to lay down and
[1:02:52] rest because I'm weary uh Hallelujah you
[1:02:56] might be trying to fight the battles in
[1:02:58] your own ability just rest in the
[1:03:01] strength of the Lord this battle is not
[1:03:03] yours it is the Lord's come on somebody
[1:03:06] this battle ain't yours but it is the
[1:03:09] Lord if you can just look to where your
[1:03:12] strength comes from when God can fight
[1:03:14] your battle
[1:03:16] you remember Jehoshaphat hope this is
[1:03:17] okay this evening remember Jehoshaphat
[1:03:20] when Jehoshaphat was going out to battle
[1:03:22] and I believe there was three kingdoms I
[1:03:25] believe that was coming against the
[1:03:26] nation and he was going to go out and
[1:03:28] fight but the Lord stopped him and says
[1:03:30] this is not your battle the battle is
[1:03:33] the Lord's but you notice what he told
[1:03:35] Jehoshaphat to do he didn't tell
[1:03:38] Jehoshaphat go get Spears he didn't tell
[1:03:40] him go get armor go get shields go get
[1:03:43] swords go get bows and heires but what
[1:03:46] he did say was go get some singers
[1:03:48] go get some worshipers this ain't my
[1:03:51] battle but I want you to create an
[1:03:54] atmosphere where I feel welcome to come
[1:03:56] and work come on somebody this ain't
[1:03:59] your battle but if you can just praise
[1:04:01] the Lord you might not be able to sing
[1:04:03] but still make a Joyful Noise unto the
[1:04:06] Lord create an atmosphere well God
[1:04:08] himself can come down and fight
[1:04:11] oh you know Harper the Wayne Lawson say
[1:04:13] one time he says what are the Angels
[1:04:15] created for he says they worship day and
[1:04:18] night day and night and he says you look
[1:04:21] at when the three Hebrew boys was there
[1:04:23] when the fiery furnace he says those
[1:04:25] angels they wanted to come down and show
[1:04:28] God's Wrath they went in the show how
[1:04:30] great they were who God but God would
[1:04:32] tell him no this is a man-sized job so
[1:04:35] hey brother Wayne would say that these
[1:04:37] angels they like battle and so whenever
[1:04:40] God allowed those angels to come down
[1:04:43] and fight for Jehoshaphat that was a
[1:04:46] wonderful thing it wasn't a man's battle
[1:04:48] but God allowed the angels to come down
[1:04:51] and patch a horse
[1:04:53] jehoshaphat's battles see the people
[1:04:56] were so confused that they wasn't seeing
[1:04:59] a natural enemy they wasn't seeing a
[1:05:02] natural a natural man but there was a
[1:05:04] there was a supernatural presence around
[1:05:07] them that the Bible says they turned on
[1:05:09] each other and started to kill each
[1:05:12] other oh come on now you see God hasn't
[1:05:16] let you hear by yourself you might not
[1:05:18] see it into the supernatural but the
[1:05:21] angels are with you every step of the
[1:05:23] way God himself is with you every step
[1:05:26] of the way if you can just see him in
[1:05:30] the Supernatural oh man I slept and then
[1:05:34] he awakened me this is a man that had
[1:05:36] been in contact with God not only did he
[1:05:39] have faith in God but God had faith in
[1:05:42] him
[1:05:43] and you see you remember the story of
[1:05:45] the lady in World War II I believe the
[1:05:47] bombs were starting to fall and the
[1:05:49] sirens were going off and there was a
[1:05:52] grandma inside of this house and the
[1:05:54] grandchildren were waiting to go to the
[1:05:56] bomb shelter that they were worried they
[1:05:58] were afraid and they said Grandma what
[1:06:00] are you doing she says I'm going to go
[1:06:02] sleep
[1:06:03] they says Grandma why are you going to
[1:06:05] sleep for we're in the middle of a raid
[1:06:08] where where the bombs are dropping
[1:06:10] around us and she says the Bible says
[1:06:12] that the Lord does not Slumber him and
[1:06:14] he does not sink why should both of us
[1:06:17] be awake I'm going to go rest oh come on
[1:06:20] now even in their Darkest Hour God does
[1:06:23] not sleep he does not Slumber so you
[1:06:26] might be weary this morning get some
[1:06:28] rest under the almighty God Under The
[1:06:31] Presence of Jehovah
[1:06:33] oh get some rest this evening and let
[1:06:37] God lift you up in the midst of the
[1:06:40] pressure oh my you see everything is
[1:06:43] designed to destroy you every spirit is
[1:06:45] designed to destroy him you look at
[1:06:47] Isaiah 54 and 17 the no weapon that is
[1:06:52] formed against him shall prosper so the
[1:06:55] devil don't just have any weapon but
[1:06:57] he's got formed weapons especially for
[1:07:00] you
[1:07:01] he's been watching he he notices what
[1:07:04] what your weaknesses are he knows where
[1:07:06] you were where your problems are he
[1:07:08] knows what you love the most you see you
[1:07:11] notice where did job get attacked by the
[1:07:13] devil you see why did the devil say when
[1:07:16] God asked him if he can consider job you
[1:07:19] look at job one and nine then Satan
[1:07:22] answered the Lord and said thus job fear
[1:07:24] God for not has not done made a hedge
[1:07:27] about him and about his house and about
[1:07:30] all that that he hath on every side and
[1:07:33] hath blessed the work of his hands and
[1:07:35] the substance is increased in the land
[1:07:37] and so before job every car before the
[1:07:41] devil ever come before God job already
[1:07:44] done his homework or the devil already
[1:07:46] done his homework
[1:07:48] he already knew what job loved he
[1:07:51] already knew what was precious in job's
[1:07:54] life and so whenever God gave the okay
[1:07:56] the devil didn't just say okay how am I
[1:07:59] going to attack job I think I'm going to
[1:08:01] come this way I think I'm I'm gonna
[1:08:03] cause him to that the records donking or
[1:08:05] I'm gonna cause him to do this I'm gonna
[1:08:07] cause him and his wife to have respect
[1:08:10] but no before the God ever gave the
[1:08:13] permission to attack job he had already
[1:08:16] scouted out job
[1:08:17] come on now so before the devil has ever
[1:08:21] attacked you he already has weapons that
[1:08:24] are specifically formed just for you but
[1:08:27] the Bible says that the the Bible says
[1:08:29] that when the Devil Comes against job he
[1:08:31] attacked his children you know what the
[1:08:33] Bible says before Judah his children was
[1:08:36] attacked he was doing the birth
[1:08:38] sacrifice for his children and so the
[1:08:41] devil knew this was the important this
[1:08:43] was important in job's life and so we
[1:08:46] know that whatever we stand for the
[1:08:49] Devil is going to attack whatever you
[1:08:51] think is right the devil is going to
[1:08:54] attack but you notice what the Bible
[1:08:56] says about job in Job 1 and 22 in all of
[1:09:00] this job sinned and not knew nor charge
[1:09:03] God foolishly so in the midst of all of
[1:09:06] the pressure he did not charge God and
[1:09:09] says what are you doing to me but he
[1:09:12] still sins and not where the Branham
[1:09:13] says the word sin is unbelief so in the
[1:09:16] midst of the prayer worship his faith
[1:09:19] still remained oh man this is a memorial
[1:09:23] that we can look at and say even in the
[1:09:26] midst of the pressure I'm can still
[1:09:29] remain
[1:09:31] he was looking to a promise you know
[1:09:33] brother Branham talks about Jonah it was
[1:09:36] Jonah that was in the belly of the whale
[1:09:37] he says we think though we've got some
[1:09:40] some infirmities we've got some bad
[1:09:42] things but he says Nothing Compares so
[1:09:45] Jonah as he was in that belly but he
[1:09:47] says he turned he says supernaturally he
[1:09:51] was led to turn towards the temple and
[1:09:53] he reminded God of his promise that he
[1:09:56] made towards Solomon whenever Solomon
[1:09:58] built the temple he he prophesied and
[1:10:01] says when Aaron When anybody is in need
[1:10:04] may they turn towards this Temple and
[1:10:07] you deliver them out of their need and
[1:10:09] brother Branham says he didn't have an
[1:10:12] oxygen tank inside of the will he didn't
[1:10:14] he we don't know how he survived but
[1:10:17] supernaturally he turned towards the
[1:10:19] temple oh supernaturally he turned
[1:10:23] towards the temple and began to pray the
[1:10:26] prayer the Solomon prophesied oh man
[1:10:28] we're being led by the spirit of God if
[1:10:31] you can just turn your eyes to where
[1:10:34] your help comes from
[1:10:36] if you can turn your eyes in the midst
[1:10:39] of the infirmities and see the God has
[1:10:42] promised he'll never leave you he'll
[1:10:44] never forsake you but he will be with
[1:10:46] you all the way to the end of the world
[1:10:48] but you see David knew before anybody
[1:10:51] could get to him they had to get through
[1:10:54] his shield he knew his shield was the
[1:10:57] Lord the anointing of his life could
[1:10:59] never be destroyed he didn't want the
[1:11:01] shield of Saul he wanted the anointing
[1:11:04] he
[1:11:07] wanted the anointing
[1:11:09] and I thought mine that should be our
[1:11:12] attitude we don't want good ideas we
[1:11:14] don't want good opinions but give me the
[1:11:16] anointing we don't want what man thinks
[1:11:19] is right give me the anointing and the
[1:11:21] anointing only comes by the word but you
[1:11:24] see a shield we're standing between
[1:11:26] David and his enemy and it was the net
[1:11:28] and there was a spiritual shield and
[1:11:30] here we are standing in legal to see him
[1:11:33] and there is a shield that is standing
[1:11:35] between us and the enemy you know
[1:11:37] brother Branham would pray in the prayer
[1:11:38] line he was says oh Lord send your
[1:11:41] anointing and stand between me and the
[1:11:43] enemy
[1:11:45] change your anointing to stand between
[1:11:47] me and the enemy it was the shield in
[1:11:51] the time of trouble and I thought my the
[1:11:53] shame anointing they were standing
[1:11:55] between him and cancer is the same
[1:11:58] anointing that is standing between us
[1:12:00] and every pressure that we go through
[1:12:03] we're living in a crazy time but the
[1:12:06] anointing remains our minds are being
[1:12:08] attacked but the anointing remains our
[1:12:10] body is being attacked but the anointing
[1:12:13] Remains the Bible says touch not my
[1:12:16] anoint him and so the devil can come and
[1:12:19] try to touch her but if the anointing is
[1:12:22] on your life there's nothing the devil
[1:12:24] can do to destroy you the Bible says
[1:12:27] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:12:29] all the fiery darts and so the shield
[1:12:32] that God has given us ain't just taking
[1:12:35] some of the fiery darts but in the midst
[1:12:38] of the pressure every darts that is
[1:12:40] coming against you the anointing is
[1:12:43] covering up every trial that you go
[1:12:45] through the anointing is right there
[1:12:48] hallelujah we're not going through it by
[1:12:51] yourself but the anointing is we're
[1:12:53] first oh not some of them but all of
[1:12:57] them shall be quenched up
[1:13:00] this is why we can rest when we feel
[1:13:03] like our world is falling apart you see
[1:13:05] because it's not us keeping our sanity
[1:13:07] it's the anointing the Bible would say
[1:13:10] if it had not been for the Lord who was
[1:13:13] on our side when the enemy rose up
[1:13:15] against us now I'm sure we all can say
[1:13:17] Amen to that if it had not been for the
[1:13:19] Lord it was the Lord that raised up a
[1:13:22] standard when the enemy was coming in
[1:13:24] like a flood the Bible would say in
[1:13:26] Psalms 34 and 19 many are the
[1:13:29] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:13:32] Lord delivereth them out of them all but
[1:13:34] the Brandon would say it's the baptism
[1:13:36] of the Holy Ghost that has brought me
[1:13:38] this form it's the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:41] Ghost that is going to take me on that's
[1:13:44] it yes sir it was good for me back there
[1:13:46] and it's good for me right now it will
[1:13:49] be in the hour of my very death just the
[1:13:52] same way
[1:13:54] the shame anointing that has brought me
[1:13:56] this form is going to be the same
[1:13:58] anointing that is going to take me
[1:14:00] through that we may get weary but the
[1:14:03] anointing is there
[1:14:05] I hope this is okay this evening
[1:14:08] but like I quoted earlier the Bible says
[1:14:10] that David I will lift up my eyes unto
[1:14:13] the hills from where my Help Cometh From
[1:14:16] my help coming from the Lord which made
[1:14:18] Heaven and Earth so he's looking to the
[1:14:21] one that gave the anointing and Psalms
[1:14:24] 27 and 1 the Lord is my light and my
[1:14:27] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:14:30] my strength of My Life whom shall I be
[1:14:32] afraid when the wicked even my enemies
[1:14:34] my foes come upon me to eat my flesh
[1:14:37] they stumbled and found though a host
[1:14:40] shouldn't cap against me my heart shall
[1:14:43] not fear the wars rise up against me and
[1:14:46] this will I be confident
[1:14:48] so he's saying my heart is not going to
[1:14:51] fear because in this I am confident oh
[1:14:55] my but you see in Psalms 27-5 from the
[1:14:58] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:15:00] Pavilion and the secret of his
[1:15:02] Tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set
[1:15:05] me upon a rock and so the security that
[1:15:09] he is finding in the midst of trouble is
[1:15:11] coming from The Rock and I thought mine
[1:15:14] that is what we're getting our security
[1:15:16] from it's the rock of Revelation he has
[1:15:19] set us upon the rock in the midst of
[1:15:22] depression in the midst of Oppression in
[1:15:25] the midst of Mind battles he has placed
[1:15:27] us upon a solid foundation that no
[1:15:30] matter what comes against us the fire is
[1:15:33] trying us but because of the right
[1:15:35] foundation we're standing in the midst
[1:15:38] of it all
[1:15:39] we're standing in the midst of it all
[1:15:41] and we can realize it's just a season
[1:15:44] it's just a season The Season's going to
[1:15:47] change
[1:15:48] come on now it's hot right now but the
[1:15:51] seasons is starting to change we're
[1:15:53] getting nice weather we're getting
[1:15:55] cooler weather if you like the winter
[1:15:56] just wait the season's going to change
[1:15:58] and right now we might be in a season of
[1:16:01] pressure but the season changer is in
[1:16:04] the building to change the season where
[1:16:07] you can step out of the trial and step
[1:16:09] into a rest
[1:16:12] oh that trial ain't going to destroy you
[1:16:15] but God is going to bring you through
[1:16:17] with the strong and mighty hand you see
[1:16:21] we can look at the man that was at the
[1:16:23] pool of bethesla the Bible says it was a
[1:16:25] certain season and it was a certain
[1:16:27] season Jesus walked by that pool and the
[1:16:31] Bible says in John 5 and 7 the impotent
[1:16:34] man answered sir I have no man when the
[1:16:37] water is troubled to put me into the
[1:16:39] pool but while I am coming another step
[1:16:42] of town before me and Jesus said unto
[1:16:45] him rise and take up thy bed and walk
[1:16:48] and immediately the man was made whole
[1:16:52] but the Branham says this man could get
[1:16:54] around he could talk he could walk but
[1:16:57] he was just feeble
[1:16:59] did you catch that he was just feeble he
[1:17:02] could walk he could talk he could get
[1:17:05] around but he was just tired and since
[1:17:07] he was tired he could not operate what
[1:17:10] he was born with he was born with legs
[1:17:12] he was born able to walk but since he
[1:17:15] got weary he could not operate what he
[1:17:18] was born with and I started to think
[1:17:20] about it when we're born again we've got
[1:17:22] joy we've got peace we've got love we've
[1:17:25] got long suffering we've got faith that
[1:17:27] is standing against the time but once we
[1:17:30] get weary we can operate what we're born
[1:17:33] with come on somebody if we get weary
[1:17:36] and worn out we can't operate the faith
[1:17:39] like we used to we used to have faith to
[1:17:42] move mountains now Faith is still there
[1:17:44] you've just gotten tired you just need
[1:17:47] to you need to get a Rest In The
[1:17:49] Presence of Jehovah you see the
[1:17:51] definition of feeble is a lacking
[1:17:53] strength so we lack the strength to put
[1:17:56] in the and put into action what he was
[1:17:59] born with but the Bible says he was in
[1:18:01] this condition for 38 years
[1:18:05] 38 years he was able to walk but did not
[1:18:09] have the strength to do it come on
[1:18:11] somebody in time and we said in this in
[1:18:14] this position of weariness for year
[1:18:16] after year after year not being able to
[1:18:19] overcome not being able to have joy and
[1:18:22] peace it's because you got tired this
[1:18:26] morning the season changer is in the
[1:18:28] building he was in a season of weariness
[1:18:32] but then it was a certain season not a
[1:18:35] season of weariness but the season
[1:18:36] changer stepped on the scene you notice
[1:18:39] what the Bible calls him the Bible costs
[1:18:42] him the the impotent man but notice
[1:18:45] after Jesus said rise up and carry your
[1:18:48] bed he doesn't call him the impotent man
[1:18:51] but he says the man was made whole the
[1:18:55] identity changed when the season changed
[1:18:58] come on somebody his identity changed
[1:19:01] when the season changer come on the
[1:19:03] scene and changed the circumstances you
[1:19:06] might be weary you might be tired you
[1:19:08] might be wore out that might be your
[1:19:10] identity this evening but the season
[1:19:12] changer has come on the scene to change
[1:19:15] the season that you're in you're in the
[1:19:18] season of tiredness you're in the season
[1:19:20] of weariness but God has come down to
[1:19:22] save that to lift you up and to give you
[1:19:25] a rest give you a strength that you can
[1:19:28] press on you're not meant to be begging
[1:19:31] you're meant to be walking you're not
[1:19:33] meant to be be crawling around and
[1:19:35] seeing you're meant to be marching
[1:19:37] forward you see this man he could not
[1:19:40] fulfill his actual Authority that he had
[1:19:43] because he was wearing
[1:19:45] but then there come the season changer
[1:19:48] that come on the scene and says you're
[1:19:50] no longer an impotent man but you're the
[1:19:54] man
[1:19:55] she's like that you're the man you're
[1:19:57] you're the man that is going to show
[1:19:59] forth my glory you're the man that is
[1:20:02] going to show forth my power and you're
[1:20:04] not meant to be weary you're meant to be
[1:20:06] the man the woman the bride show me for
[1:20:10] the power of Jesus Christ you see as she
[1:20:14] is season changed when the weariness
[1:20:16] lives and you look at Isaiah 40 and 31
[1:20:19] but they thou wait upon the Lord shall
[1:20:22] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[1:20:24] with wings as eagles they shall run and
[1:20:27] not be weary
[1:20:29] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:20:33] shall walk and not faint in other words
[1:20:36] you're trying to run but you're wearing
[1:20:38] you're trying to walk but you're
[1:20:40] fainting but the spirit of the Lord is
[1:20:43] in the building to change the season
[1:20:45] where you can run and not be weary oh
[1:20:50] Hallelujah you want to be on fire again
[1:20:52] on the things of God get in the season
[1:20:55] Changers presence then he can say he can
[1:20:58] change the season but the Brandon would
[1:20:59] say God took a baby a baby born never
[1:21:02] did see in his life at 16 years old his
[1:21:05] Iowa his side back to him God can make
[1:21:09] God can take a miserable Rich of a
[1:21:11] cancer eaten person he says then because
[1:21:13] the message is right because God sent
[1:21:16] the message because God sent the
[1:21:18] messenger no doubt every gun of Hell
[1:21:20] will be firing at him that's right he'll
[1:21:23] stumble and fall and get back up and
[1:21:26] shake his head and go on
[1:21:28] now I thought mine we might stumble we
[1:21:31] my fault we might get tripped up but we
[1:21:34] are going forward getting back up
[1:21:35] shaking our head
[1:21:38] but the brand I must say he in the same
[1:21:40] quote he says Get Up shake his hand and
[1:21:42] go on we got a message nothing is going
[1:21:45] to stop and Hallelujah Upon This Rock
[1:21:48] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:21:51] Hell will never Prevail against it they
[1:21:53] can say what they want to do what they
[1:21:56] want to the devil can rage and how but
[1:21:58] Jesus raised from the dead he lives
[1:22:01] today in us he says we must stumble we
[1:22:04] might fall but get back up we've got a
[1:22:07] message to carry come on now get up out
[1:22:10] of the Gloom get up out of the weariness
[1:22:12] get up out of the condemnation we've got
[1:22:15] a message to go forth with Upon This
[1:22:18] Rock
[1:22:19] excuse me upon the shrock I will build
[1:22:22] my church and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:22:25] shaken
[1:22:27] you see you look at Matthew
[1:22:30] Matthew 10 or 22 and you shall be hated
[1:22:33] of all men for my name's sake but he
[1:22:35] that endureth to the end shall be saved
[1:22:38] he that endureth not he that followeth
[1:22:41] but the he that gets back up and endures
[1:22:46] amen as the musicians come this evening
[1:22:48] you know I was thinking of the story
[1:22:51] earlier remember when David was at a low
[1:22:53] spot he and his men had come back to
[1:22:56] ziglag I believe that's how you say it
[1:22:58] I'm bad at pronouncing words but I think
[1:23:00] it was ziglag and say come back and the
[1:23:04] not the Philistines but the amorites the
[1:23:07] amalekites had come into the town and
[1:23:10] taken away the families taking away the
[1:23:12] children taking away the women taking
[1:23:14] away all the spoils and the Bible says
[1:23:17] that his men turned against David and
[1:23:20] was ready to Stone him
[1:23:22] ready to Stone him because because the
[1:23:25] the enemy are coming in and taken away
[1:23:28] their families but the Bible says that
[1:23:31] David encouraged himself from the Lord
[1:23:34] he found his encouragement when his
[1:23:36] family turned against him he found his
[1:23:39] encouragement in the one
[1:23:41] that anointed him hope hope this has
[1:23:44] come together this evening the only way
[1:23:46] you're going to find your encouragement
[1:23:48] is to look to the one that anointed you
[1:23:52] you know I know there's a thing called
[1:23:54] stress eating whenever you get stressed
[1:23:56] out you want to eat some people are
[1:23:58] different some eat some do this some do
[1:24:00] that they're stressed out so they're
[1:24:01] trying to find comfort in something and
[1:24:04] here David was a finding comfort in
[1:24:07] natural things he was Finding comfort
[1:24:10] and the one that anoints at him Natural
[1:24:12] Things ain't going to bring Comfort a
[1:24:15] new car ain't going to bring Comfort a
[1:24:16] nice house ain't going to bring Comfort
[1:24:18] a boyfriend or a girlfriend ain't gonna
[1:24:20] bring Comfort but the one that gave the
[1:24:22] anointing can bring comfort and his God
[1:24:26] not the other ones God but my God and
[1:24:30] David said to to the priest
[1:24:32] son I pray they bring me hither the yes
[1:24:36] and an epiphar brother thither but
[1:24:40] thither the Epitaph the David and David
[1:24:43] inquired of the Lord saying shall I
[1:24:45] pursue after this troop shall I overtake
[1:24:48] them and he answered him pursue for Thou
[1:24:51] shalt overtake them and without fail
[1:24:54] recover all what was his encouragement
[1:24:57] pursue
[1:25:00] recover it all
[1:25:02] pursue pursue and cover it and recover
[1:25:06] it all watch the encouragement of the
[1:25:08] Lord saying you might have lost your joy
[1:25:10] you might have lost your peace the
[1:25:12] pressure might have taken your love away
[1:25:14] but pursue it
[1:25:16] pursue it and take back your joy take
[1:25:20] back your peace Take Back Your Love take
[1:25:23] back everything the Devils go from you

[1:25:56] You're Still chosen you just need to get
[1:25:59] out of that weariness get out of that
[1:26:01] weary state but random tells the dream
[1:26:04] of the brother had he says the devil is
[1:26:06] coming and scaring him I would say boo
[1:26:09] and brother Branham says the man would
[1:26:11] get smaller when he got scared and the
[1:26:13] devil got bigger
[1:26:14] and he says the man the devil said boo
[1:26:16] the man got smaller the devil got bigger
[1:26:19] but then the man turned in and grabbed
[1:26:21] the Bible and he said boo back and the
[1:26:24] man says in the dream the devil got
[1:26:26] smaller and he got bigger he said it
[1:26:28] again boo he says the man the devil got
[1:26:31] smaller and the man got bigger and so he
[1:26:34] was Tiny and brother Brandon says this
[1:26:36] when I said boo every time I said boo he
[1:26:39] got smaller I got bigger that's it
