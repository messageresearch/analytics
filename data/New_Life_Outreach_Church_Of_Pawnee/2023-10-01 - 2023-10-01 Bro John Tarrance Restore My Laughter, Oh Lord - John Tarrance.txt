[Music] pres PR amen hallelujah GL to God you know there's not a single time in my life that I ever step foot in the presence of God that I didn't walk away a new man all right every single time it lifts you up a little higher and a little higher and a little higher and a little higher and then all in the sudden one of these days in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we're going to be so high oh I said it so high the world perverted it but we're going to be high we're going to get high and we're going to meet him on the cloud amen you know that Satan always perverts the truth as kids we go out and we do dumb stuff to to achieve the heights that we're supposed to be as Sons and Daughters of God achieve the heights that are hours and so Satan pushes stuff at us and we make bad choices and do bad things trying to achieve it but there really is a high in the presence of God that is [Music] unreal it is otherworldly and it will make you stagger it'll make you stumble it'll make you speak in a whole another language and that's what I look for tonight amen that's what I look for in my walk with God a changed man no longer Earthly but Heavenly amen well it's a pleasure to be in the house of God with yall boy I almost changed my whole sermon right there praise the Lord that's uh there's definitely anointing here tonight amen it's an honor to be here it's an honor to stand behind the sacred desk thank you brother wendle uh it really truly is an honor to be with the bride of Jesus Christ and I'm a you all forgive me I'm a little nervous tonight I had been thinking of this thought for a while back bouncing it around in my head trying to come to a conclusion or a or a walk with it and uh it just didn't never seemed to fit until brother Wendell told that testimony this morning uh so I'm going to ad lib his testimony a little bit and I hope he forgives me amen and then it didn't got home and my wife said well you know about this right and I was like wait a second it was the missing piece that just went right with the whole thing amen so honestly tonight you can blame brother Wendell and you can blame blame my wife for this one okay oh praise the Lord if you can turn in your Bibles to Isaiah 43 we're going to start at verse one and believe it or not this is the song that April was singing part of it praise the Lord amen but uh Isaiah 43 And1 but now thus sayeth the Lord that createth thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine when thou passest through the waters I'll be with thee and through the rivers D not overflow thee when thou wst through the fire Thou shalt not be burnt neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel the Savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and Saba for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou H has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people people for thy life fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and bring my daughters from the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have Rec created him for my glory and I have formed him yay I have made amen him oh glory to God you were created specifically for God Amen let's let's go to the Lord in prayer dear heavenly father Lord we approach your throne tonight so thankful for the word of God lord so thankful for the all of the things that you've given us and the message that came to bring bring this Bible to life and to tell us your thoughts about us Lord because that's what this Bible is it's it's all about you and in you we find out who we are God oh Lord I ask you to move me out of the way father and and take over and speak Words of Life to your people because Lord if it's just me it it means nothing but Lord if you'll speak your words bring life we ask you to come now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ amen yall can have your seats amen I like that I have created him for my glory my glory so that means when everything goes wrong and the one thing that goes right wasn't you I mean he pretty much sums it up no no it's my glory I did it I created you for me I formed you for me I brought you for me your entire life is for him yes sir amen and you know that's amazing because as brother wend was preaching this morning about the husband and wife it it actually really does make sense because without my wife sometimes I feel like I can't do anything yeah you know I get up I go to work I forget to do this I forget to do that and I'm constantly on the phone um I need you to run here and do this I Didn't Do It um I need to go over here and do this cuz I didn't do it or I'm at work and I get that phone call did you uh no I'll do it oh thank you you know what I mean it really is one she is for me and I am for her okay so every step that I take should be for him right every thought that I have every emotion that I have every should be for him amen oh I love it now we're going to go a little bit crazy here forgive me brother soise Lord when brother wend was telling his testimony and he was talking about them all laughing at him because the title of my message believe it or not is restore my laughter Oh Lord now that not restore laughter not restore fun making okay not to restore scoffing not to restore being mean not to restore no restore my laughter but you got to remember everything that he created in me was for him and his glory so my laughter is his laughter my my joy is his Joy when I get the happiness of something good happening in my life he's getting Joy from doing something good in my life so when he was telling his testimony and he was talking about how they were all laughing at him and and saying no no no no whatever but he didn't he gets all the stuff and he gets in there and he gets to bend in the pipe you said and really just reading and practicing and doing because you were going to do it you see you was going to have the last say come on right you wanted to be the champion well us as Christians ought to want to have the last say come on we want to have the last bit of joy that out there is theirs plain and simple none of that joy that entertainment that nonsense is ours none of it yeah but through all the scoffing and through all the laughing and through all of the picking fun because we stand and say I believe do you know how much the smirks and the laughs and the Grins and the people almost choking and stuff when I tell them I have two perfectly good eyes okay come on they're looking at me like this guy's lost it this guy is gone yeah yeah and I'm like no I do I haven't lost that eye got it I may not see it in this world but I'll see it that one they're like he's crazy he's nuts you know that's all in scripture that's all back on paper none of that stuff happens anymore so what do I do I go and I read and I been and I study and like the willow tree I form myself to the word of God because when this is all said and done I'm going to be laughing all right but I promise you I'm not going to be laughing laughing at them like they're laughing at me I'm going to be laughing because standing before them is the full interpretation and the full manifestation of the word of God that they said couldn't happen and for the glory of God I will be laughing because I'll be like I told you God was real I told you God would do it and I am looking for that day so yes restore to me restore my laughter my what the the exuberance is that the right word the I don't even know I'm so excited I don't even know how to profess it in the English language but to be able to just say this is God he done it his word he said it it's right here look he done it you remember me yesterday now look at me today oh and you can't help but laugh that's right when the spirit of the Lord Lord falls upon this place I will dance like David danced I'm not going to get a loin cloth praise the Lord but he danced and he danced and he danced and he was so excited to see the words of his time coming back to its rightful place coming back to where it was supposed to be he was so excited he was dancing they were shouting they were screaming they were laughing oh oh they were so excited everything's going so good all excited and then there's his wife now before I'm going to get into what she thought about the whole thing do you realize that she had been there with David from the beginning yeah she had been around when Goliath was slain she had been right there the king's daughter yeah I mean she had been right there married to David watched him slay his tens David Saul his thousands and David his 10,000s she had been right there she heard it she seen it with her own eyes she knew everything of the what he was anointed and she knew it and if you go to the first chapter of Samuel I believe it is it even said on there that they had reported to Saul that she loved David now do you know that she was the second choice well he was supposed to marry the other daughter but Saul married her off and said well since she loves you we'll just give you her and she loved David so she was all excited about it so David ended up with the other daughter kind of bring up like another story supposed to marry Rachel but ended up with Leah right but anyways so this wasn't even but she loved David yeah but after so many years years yeah of being the best so many years of being the cream of the crop so many years of everything just being oh she's so perfect she loves David David loves her David's the greatest David's this David and she's David's wife and she's all up here now she was the daughter of the king went all the way to the Bride of the queen or the king depends on what part of the world I guess all that stuff going and through it all when she looked out there and saw him rejoicing in the word of God the Bible says she despised him yeah she's like what in the world do you think you're doing we have to stand up to all of these people they're going to remember this your legacy is going to be that and in reality his legacy was going to be that but not his nakedness his dancing all right she was right but she wasn't right all right how many years do we sit here listen to it rejoice in it feel the presence of God do it keep coming flows over you you're so excited like you're the bride yep yep yep you go out and tell everybody yep yep yep I'm the bride this is it year after year after year and then somebody new comes in and they get just a wee bit out of line you're like what in the world forget that some oldtime all the sudden get to hold that Holy Spirit and or not jumps up and starts running across the floor then what you thought they're too old for that are you kidding me come on well that's what she was doing yeah in her mind she was criticizing the move of the spirit all right she had been around it so long she had heard it so long that she was actually weighted down by the truth he was the king he was anointed he was he was going to be king right I mean she had it all I mean she had the truth she had everything but she couldn't take one little thing okay not little thing probably a big thing there's a lot of people out there you know and I'm sure if April saw me out there dancing like that too she'd probably be like wait a second you better make sure you're in the spirit buddy right but I don't think she would have despised me you know I don't think she would have looked at it as something that was really really bad something that was just going to ruin them because you know what happened to her she became Barren she wasn't fruitful she was still the daughter of the king she was still the Bride of David he didn't put her away like bashy that ain't what the Bible said the Bible just said all right he said all right then I'll go somewhere else and she was Barren till the day she died sometimes oh Lord help me sometimes in Our Truth our truth because a belief is not always true okay A belief is not always fact so you can believe it's somebody in the flesh all you want to it doesn't make it a fact that they're not in the spirit or you can believe they're in the spirit all day long and and the only person that knows is them and God that's the honest goodness truth the only people to know so instead of joining in and thinking to myself well I don't know about that you know well you know hope hope hopefully it's God they're up dancing and I'm unsure about it you know what I'm going to do cuz I am sure about me that is one thing I can say is I am sure about me and if you ever catch me dancing it's going to be in the spirit cuz I don't dance plain and simple that's just the truth I sing very quietly I clap my hands I you know I I love to worship God but I do it in my own little bubble I I honestly I do sometimes I get in my bubble so much that I don't even know what goes on on the house for hours it's my bubble it's my time I'm in his presence it's mine and I want it that's my time yeah so if we would spend our time in that then maybe just maybe we wouldn't have to say what we said about that and stun our own growth CU we're not supposed to judge nobody right and I don't want to stunt my growth in God because I just told you that I want to get high as a kite literally High yeah right I mean that's just the truth I want to dance in the spirit I I don't want to stomp myself so if we flip this around there was another wife and her name was Sarah all right so her husband comes to her and says guess what she's like what you're going to have a baby what come on man all right if you say so you know no seriously God told me oh I'm sure he did I believe you you know she just goes on with her life how in the world am I going to have a baby how am I going to have a baby yeah right she never denied it she never oh no no I don't know how that's going to happen but you know okay 10 years go by you're going to have a baby yeah that's what she said well you know we're around so much so that she said well maybe just maybe you got the steps of it wrong take my servant she'll have the baby everybody will quit laughing at us this will be done and we'll go I can almost see Abraham said no that ain't what God Said and you know being a good wife yeah but this is probably you misunderstood you know you don't hear very good you're getting old you know so this is probably the way it's OB he said all right let's do it they had the baby and it wasn't God's baby because once that baby was born jealousy ripped through that house she the one was like well I'm Queen now she's like no you're not well it's my kid no it ain't it's mine I'm taking it away from you oh no no no no anyway jealousy running so far that he guy had to go but you understand it wasn't Sarah that had to go nobody said Sarah you made a mistake nobody come in and said Sarah I despise you for doing this yeah hegar she was a servant it's not like she had a choice it was give him a baby or get kicked out and you know what ended up happening she got kicked out it's not like she had a choice so why would you kick her out instead of kicking Sarah out right because Sarah believed they were going to have a baby she didn't per se understand and believe how the baby was going to come but she still believed in the moving of the spirit she still believed Abraham talked to God she still believed that the spirit was there she believed all of that and remember Abraham's belief was accounted to him for righteousness well if Sarah is part of Abraham otherwise she would have died in the tent I mean she pretty much said laughed right in his face and said me and then no I didn't think that um but she believed beli D God's word right she didn't per se believe that it was going to come through her but she believed there would be a son and through the belief through her own little bubble through all of that there was a renewing now mind you it was Abraham's belief that was accounted to him for righteousness he staggered not at the promise all right her respect for him was never going to call him a liar okay but it became a renewing until they were made young again which brings us back to the eagle that he was preaching on a while back brother brandom told this tells the story and about how an eagle renews itself because in the Scriptures it says you know to renew Like an Eagle right so he was saying how an eagle as it gets about a generation or 30 40 years old all right its eyes gets crusted up and its beak because you know their beak and Talons and everything grows all the time never stops so and that is the you know scientifically proven fact so if it builds all up and crust all over they brother brandom said that that eagle would fly up into a cliff of The Rock and beat his head or her head against this rock to bust all that stuff off and as it was doing this over a period of time it would lose all of its feathers pull out the bad ones get all new feathers and basically fly off the mountain like a brand new Young Eagle yeah well let's take that back then sitting in church five years 10 years 15 years 20 years 30 years eyes are getting a little cloudy even the prophet John said it well go ask him his eyes got cloudy well let me tell you something brothers and sisters bent knees breaks chains it does bent knees brings about all of the impossibilities you could ever imagine a bent knee not crossed arms well I don't know I wonder what the day is coming and wonder what's going to happen today I wonder what this is going to bring no oh Lord I don't know I don't know if they're right I don't know if they're wrong but Lord help them help me to understand benty is what breaks the chains amen oh I I jumped way ahead praise the Lord I love I love doing that so that's just okay I jumped way ahead let me back up so through all of that yeah they were made young again so much so that a young king wanted to marry her and you all know the story it was a poor Abraham was a coward said well I'm just going to tell them you're my sister I ain't lying technically technically there's no such thing as a technically not lying if you're Happ to say I'm technically not lying lying you're probably lying that one's free um so but anyways and then God comes down because why God said I created everything for me you're for me Sarah the promise Abraham was all was for his glory it wasn't for that little young King's Glory it wasn't for Abraham's Glory it wasn't even for Sarah's Glory it was for his glory and so they brought them back together and boom within that year in the time of life they had a son and she named him Isaac ISAC and this is where April came in and said you know Isaac means laughter right oh yeah I never knew that well anyways if she could have heard the screaming down there she probably realized I never knew that but I do now and I like this because in Genesis 21-6 it named it Isaac and said goth God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me all right oh what a difference not laughing at her anymore oh no more are they scoffing at her no more are they going oh yeah right you're you're you're out there you're crazy you need to go get medicine no more of all of that no now when she sat in there laughing I told you look at my baby look at my son his name is Isaac every single time somebody said the name Isaac they were laughing with her yeah because Isaac May laughed her yeah so even if it came another generation down the road that they didn't remember the story and she was telling them and they're like really Isaac as soon as they say Isaac they were laughing with her because Isaac me laughed her and she was laughing she had the Little P patter feet of her own child her own going she had it there I mean brothers and sisters her laughter was there she had her laughter and then one day Abraham comes in there and says Isaac grab up the stuff we're out of here and Sarah's like excuse me he's like oh don't worry he's going with me uh this don't look right well woman just all right and he goes up and he goes up the mountain to do what God told him to do because he truly believed God and out of his belief for God he looked at him and said don't worry me and no l will come back because his laughter was already there yeah yeah he he he could laugh all day long God told him you're going to take your son up there and you're going to kill him well Hallelujah anyhow don't let the devil get me down come on Isaac well it's the same way with you bent knees breaks chains breaking of a chain brings a revelation you can't be healed if you ain't sick yes you can't be delivered if you ain't bound so every time that you have to bend your knee to be tried in the fire to come out is gold which is what you have to be to get up there every single time you do and that chain breaks it's a revelation line upon line precept upon precept everything everything one after another for his glory until you can honestly get up on a Monday morning with no money in the bank seven 50 bills do druck won't start can't get to work knowing if you miss work today you're going to get fired and you can look out at the Sunrise and go Hallelujah anyhow I ain't going to let the devil get me down no when these big old hard Trials come my way just going to lift my hands and say hallelujah anyhow that's the laughter I want restored that's the first love that I want restored that's where I was at the beginning that I have let years upon years of this and that wear me down to where I can say Lord you said it and I believe it but in the back of my mind I'm going he's not going to do it this time don't see how it's possible this time I don't see it I don't no no no no no he already saw it he created you for him he done everything to you for his glory everything that you're going through is for him and his glory he's already saw the end of it so when you come up and you see that mountain standing there I want you to jump up when the spirit of the Lord is in this place I will sing like David sang When the Spirit of the Lord is in this place I will dance like David danced why because it's the joy and the laughter that's contagious and it goes from you to your wife or your wife to your husband from the them to the kids from the kids to the neighbors from the neighbors to their neighbors until all in a sudden you have an entire town going why are we dancing and you can turn around and look at them and say because the glory of God is in this [Laughter] place oh let's just do it hey it I can't help it don't you see what he showed me I can have the laughter I can have the peace I can have the no matter what I am his no matter what heaven is mine no matter what and you say well now brother you know Satan he really going to throw some things at you love let him let him yeah because believe it or not he can throw whatever he wants to throw it's my decision yeah that bases the outcome of what he throws oh yeah I can either accept it or not accept it I can either take it or not take it so when he's laughing at me I'm going to turn it right back around and I'm going to laugh right back at him and say don't you realize every single time Satan you throw this at me at the end of this whole thing it's coming right back on your head how dumb can you be Satan I mean you're getting so much stuff piled on your head you really ain't going to have to worry about the Lake of Fire you're going to have to worry about being crushed first imagine the weight of all that and then have to go to the lake of fire with all the broken bones and everything cuz he can't heal so he's got to Oh Praise the Lord Satan can't touch you he can't do anything to you God lets him through the Hedge God lets him run rampid God says you can do anything but touch his life what does that mean well you say I don't understand but you done it and your boy he died anyways you prayed I know but that ain't the life it's the eternal life that he cannot touch it's your destination he cannot take away he cannot under any circumstance take away your Eternal destination so laugh laugh he the scoffers all oh you guys are nuts you guys are I know it and I love it and I ain't going to change it why because nobody else can give me this there ain't a pill in the world that can make me feel like this there ain't a needle in in the world that can make me as drunk as this there is not a pill in the world that can heal me like this true well brother John you're still blind no I'm not if I was still blind then I couldn't see the word of God that's the only blindness that I'm caring about I don't care if I have one eyes two eyes 10 eyes you know they used to call me five eyes one two I had to safety glass mom dad anyways it was weird you know cuz I didn't have the one but they counted the side pieces of eyes anyways is a weird thing I got in a lot of fights but there's only one eye that I'm worried about and that's the eye of Faith that's right Revelation brings faith faith comes by what hearing the word so how do you get Revelation by hearing the word it's a cycle That Never Ends if you don't let it if you don't let it but you got to stand on it and you must believe it yes yes we are our biggest scoffers all the world's laugh people laugh at us but we're the ones hidden away in our closet saying well I guess he's not going to do it today well I guess I'll I'll wait till the next or you're we are our biggest critics we are our biggest everything not only are we our biggest trouble we can be our biggest cheerleader woo turned that one around didn't we well you can get up in the morning look yourself right in the mirror and go I got this all [Laughter] right amen look in the mirror and go well good morning Jesus well you are he changed your name do you ever wonder why in a marriage the woman's supposed to change your name I never understood how they got a round from that and the women don't change the names and still have two separate names well obviously they're not married because when you become married it's a name change so if you are the bride the wife of Jesus Christ you had a name change brothers and sisters you are Mrs Jesus Christ and when my wife and I got married and we went down to the bank I didn't just put her name on my bank account I didn't have a bank account I opened up a bank account in her name and mine and deposited my income into that bank account I'm going somewhere with that yes it's my bank account yes it's her bank account yes it's a joint account but when you get an email on that account it says John's woman that's her email address anyway you just got a deposit made into your account it doesn't say Mr John Mr torren you got money deposited that ain't what it says we overdraw that account and it says John's woman you wrote too many checks okay now this is hey she picked that email address believe it or not it's John's woman 2000 because we got married in 2000 I love that she'll never change that email address I promise you anyways but every interaction with that bank account yeah is in her name okay my name's on the bank account if it wasn't they would do her no good she don't have no money was true you don't I'm going to sit down here for just a second she doesn't have any money right plain and simple plain and simple she doesn't work even if she did work she still wouldn't have any money it be my money it I had to sit down for that one brother the reason I'm saying saying that is is everything that I own everything that I have is hers everything and yet everything is mine if my name wasn't on the bank account she couldn't do anything with it because nothing would get deposited into it nothing would get they would look at it and say but you don't work and she's like yeah well I'm but since my name's on there and we go down to get a loan if we need to get a loan or we want to buy car and we go down there and she writes her name down she can't buy that car until I write my name down because I have the income I put it in the bank yeah all right going somewhere with this we have a bank account right here this yeah is our bank account everything in there has our name on it everything healing has your name on it Deliverance has your name on it finances has your name on it every single thing in there has your name on it now on that account is another name and that is Mr Jesus Christ right and he's the one that funds that account all right okay all right so now in the worldly sense when I know and I understand that some ladies have to work and I'm not I'm not saying that just for me in April I know her band payments due I make sure there's money in that account to cover that band payment the insurance is coming up due I make sure there's money in there to pay that insurance right and then if I'm looking at the accounts going oh no I I ain't got no money to put in there guess what I do I work more hours to get more money to put in the account God has everything this account will never ever you you talk about like you know all these big billionaires in the world that have all the money they have so much money that they throw money at each other trying to make each other fail I mean that's how much money they have they never want for anything typical Le oia rich and yet they're broke right but they have all that money to do anything and everything they want to do and yet they absolutely have nothing and the reason I say that is watch their marriage life watch the things that they go through watch through that no you all that money does them no good none so it ain't the money in this account even though it's in there for me to pay my bills talking about the Bible my finances are in that the Bible said if I pay my ties and I pay my offerings okay as long as I don't go crazy and try to spend a billion dollars and make a thousand I can cover my bills okay but what's in this bank account that I want more than anything in the world all right is Jesus Christ you're like you just said it was a bank account yep I did and he makes deposits into it yep he does so everything that he puts into that he puts in of himself if I'm going to put money in my bank account I have to take myself to go make the money to put the money inside the bank account so when I put money in that bank account to pay the bills I'm putting into that account of myself this Bible is written to explain to you who Jesus Jesus Christ is okay this is the revelation of Jesus Christ and in the revelation of Jesus Christ is the revelation of Mrs Jesus Christ bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh okay so in this bank account he has put everything of him he said I go to prepare a place for you okay he put in a deposit of himself he said I'm the Lord that Health all of your diseases all he put in a deposit to cover all all he's like by my stripes you're already healed he put in a deposit to make sure no matter whatever comes your way your healing is already done sitting there waiting for you to pick it up all you got to do is write that check pick it up off the counter and head on it's that simple you just got to believe he's putting the deposit in oo see now that one hurts because what did he tell Thomas he said oh you better is he that believes that doesn't see that him that believes that does you know because he wanted to see the nail scars in his hands and brothers and sisters I never got to see William Brandon preach I never got to see his big meetings where he discerned the thoughts of the hearts I never got to see it I never got to feel the presence of God that strong I never got to hear him speak out across to say well there's a light right there there's this I never physically ever got to be in that yeah but what I have praise the Lord is a deposit into my account about 1,200 of them to where I can at least hear what happened I can at least hear the testimony I can think to myself oo o that look look there he just spoke to that lady he said that garter was rolling across oh my goodness look at that that blind eyes was open yeah and my mind's going and my eyes are about this big and everybody's like what in the world's wrong with that guy pull out the piece oh I'm listening to a story yeah it's great put it back in you know eyes big and white I never personally got to see it but I promise you I believe it I believe [Applause] you may have never physically seen an armed girl back but you can believe it'll happen you may have never physically seen eyes open but you can believe it's going to happen you may have never physically seen somebody saved out of the depths of Despair so bad that when they finally stand before a mirror they're completely new people but you can believe it can happen cuz he said it because he said it so if the time that's gone on has clouded our vision and the time that's got on has covered our eyes to where we can't see as clearly closed our beaks to where we can't eat as well there's still a rock to beat your head against there's still an altar to Fall on Your Knees at there's still a place to go to say God forgive meu clear out my eyes and restore my laughter the laughter that said anything that's possible the laughter that looked Satan in the eye and said not today the laughter that said I don't care if it's been 20 years the laughter that says today's the day today is the day for what I don't know but it's going to happen I don't know but it's going to happen what do you mean you don't know what it's going to happen there's a lot of message believing people there's a lot of good stuff that can happen today it may not be mine my Ain my time may not have come but there's something good going to happen today because God said it and I believe it and if it don't happen for me it'll happen for him and my day will be tomorrow but it's going to happen so I can laugh and I can dance and when the testimonies come across and you're hearing those testimonies you can dance and you can say praise the Lord that's my God that's my husband that's he's [Music] mine hey you can and he didn't even do it for you but it doesn't matter because if he did it for them he will do it for you amen and that is a bank account you can count on it you can stand on it you can believe on it you can rest your Eternal Soul on that word of God and laugh all the way to the bank cuz you know good and well whatsoever you ask for in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is yours amen amen yes brother we're Overcomers we've read the back of the book we can laugh in the face of adversity not laugh at your brothers and sisters no don't get all cranky when the spirit moves join it you know all that's telling myself a little bit I really am always have been that quiet guy in the corner never said much kept my mouth shut April we we'd go on a 10-hour trip and I'd probably say three words and she never shut up hey and I loved it I still do yeah she's because if she's talking my ear off she's happy yeah she's talking talking and she's happy and I can let my mind go here and that oh yeah yeah babe I yep yep yep yep you got to listen to her otherwise you can't answer the questions when she ask them so obviously I'm listening all right but as you're as I'm going through life and she's just going and going and going and talking and talking and talking honey can the kids have a hamster honey can I put the gas in the van honey can I do this oh can you believe they're having a scun thing can we can we go to that and and it's going yeah yeah sure yeah yeah sure sometimes I feel like that's the way God is he's sitting there listening driving and you're just a chattering he's like oh oh my baby's happy yeah yeah yeah and then all of a sudden silence whoa what did I do I mean okay what's up all right if there's silence something's wrong okay it's the truth if there's silence something's wrong and sometimes I think he does the same thing he's like whoa there's silence and he steps over there closer to you he's listening to you is he they going to ask me he knows I'll give it to them I'll give them anything they want they're going to just ask me ask me and finally he's going to say all right and he's going to move on he's going to do or whatever he said he'd never leave you ref like you he's still around he's your husband he's there good whatever then all in a sudden you finally have enough of it and you're like Lord I wanted that van why didn't you ask I can't buy you a van I don't know you want well you know everything yeah but you got to ask me you have not because you ask not I'm sorry people you have not because you ask not you ask not because you don't believe you know there's that saying he say you know there's three types of Believers in every church and in my own humble honest opinion sometimes I feel we can be any of those three at any given time I believe that a Holy Ghost Field son and daughter of God can have hiccups in their life that makes them question who they are they they're like man really do I have it or do I don't I can't believe I did that you know does does that make him a make no you know they're they're not even believing who they are the Bible says who you are so if you're not believing who you are then you're unbelieving because you're a son and daughter of God you're the Bride of Jesus Christ there's no saved today and not tomorrow okay I mean it's plain and simple so sometimes you go around and that other times you're like yep I know he'll Heal Me yep he'll heal me he said he would and and honestly you're a make believer because in the M back of your head you're saying well he just don't want to heal me I'm stuck with this this is my Paul's whatever they called Paul's thing in his side this is this is my thing this is this is that no no that's not what he said he said by my stripes you're healed plain and simple we don't have to stay with it we don't have to keep it I don't have to stay blind in my eye everybody told me you're blind in that eye just so you wouldn't wouldn't join the Marines everybody knew if I had two good eyes I'd would join the Marines plain simple dad says I'd be a truck driver everybody else swears I'd join the Marine so probably i' have been a truck driver in the Marines so they say you lost your eye so you wouldn't join the Marines yeah that's what they say okay I I'll take that right because everything's ordered of the Lord everything's going the way it's supposed to go every evil thing is for your good that's what he said I mean all right so well I'm too old to join Marines now I mean you minimum of age is what 45 that's even to join the reserves right so I'm 45 now so that's out well that truck driver uhuh she'd kill me so that's out all right so if it was to keep me from being a marine it was to keep me from being a truck driver both of those are out right so if both of those are out then I can get my eyesight right well see that's a way way way roundabout way of looking at something that God gave me over 2,000 years ago all right God isn't going to heal me just because I can't do this no more or I can't do that no more or I'm too old for this now he he can heal me now because I won't run over here and do this he can take this away now because well I won't go over here no no he does it because he loves you he done it on the cross don't don't he deposited the money in your bank account the time leading up to and on the cross he took the beatings for your healing he even took it for your iniquities that is doing something wrong when you know better that's an iniquity and you say well brother you know comes a time you send away that day of Grace I I get that I I understand that and you know at one time I thought that's what I'd done but I'm living proof as long as there's breath in your body you can come to Jesus Christ I'm living proof of it yeah and I can laugh knowing where I came from knowing what I did knowing what I did to people knowing what I've had to make right knowing all of the things in my life that would make me one of the worst possible human beings on the planet but my God loved me and he put the money in the bank account and said' it's all right CU one day his wife's going to finally prove to him that Jesus Christ is real one of these days his wife's life is going to prove to him that God is real because you you can take it whatever laugh at me whatever you want to do if my wife hadn't been the Christian she was all those years I wouldn't be standing here that's the way I see it we got married told her and to be honest with you we decided to go to church and I told her I said well there's only one church I'll go to okay there's only one church that's got the truth but the honest the goodness truth is that I chose that church because I was pretty sure she wouldn't go that's the truth I said that because I was almost 100% sure she wouldn't give up our lifestyle to go back to that church and boy was I wrong she wasn't back to church two times no more shorts no more pants no more trimming the hair no more none of that stuff and I'm going what did I do but I couldn't say nothing because now I'd already said I'll only go to one you see the hand of God moving yet he used my own words against me you see because I knew there was a truth see I was like Sarah I knew there was a truth and I knew this message was the truth now mind you I thought just about everybody I ever met in it was a hypocrite but that's my own fault all right that well ain't the people's fault that ain't God's fault that's my fault okay so I I believed all that but I knew the message was the truth but I honestly believed there was no way God would take me after I went and did the stuff that I did when I was raised on the Pew of that church so I was like well all right so I went to church with her had my first experience with God I'll never forget it because I don't cry never have not really just don't you know I've got scars on my legs and stuff and I'm sitting there looking at it and I wrap it up and I'm like GP my teeth and I go on because you know I just you cried when I tell you don't know my friends or my old friends let a tear escape and they punch it off your cheek you know you just didn't didn't do it you just did not do it we weren't sissies that's what they called us if we cried but here I am in the church in front of all of my family because that's what the church was my whole family and everything David Syer just a preaching and I don't know what happened I ended up at the front of the church on my knees balling like you wouldn't believe that was my first experience it took 14 years something like that for the full change to come but now let me tell you what my wife has done I'm over here I can't believe this every but what do you mean you want me to go to church I don't want to go to church this Wednesday night I don't want to go to church I worked hard today I want to go to bed call at my boss hey call me in he's like what call me in okay okay hold on hold on yep right on it boss out that's the truth she going to get me when we get home but it's true you know I get I don't know how we got here brother W but what she was doing is she was sitting over here in the sidelines Hallelujah any hell they ain't GNA let the devil get me down oh when John boy messes up today I'm just going to look at that devil and say hallelujah anyhow and yes she was looking me all right and she smil that beautiful smile laugh that laugh talk talk talk talk talk you ain't gonna believe what happened to church you should have been there finally I was like oh really really you know say that's awesome I wish I could have seen that really really him yeah oh I wish I could have been there for that one you see the change you know I believe brother brandom said sometimes that the husband can be Sanctified by the wife he said sure stay with him I don't know where we're going here brother but praise the Lord she had the laughter even the people in the church called her a liar because they swore up and down had to be the meanest person you ever met she's like oh no he's good I get down he cleans the house which is the honest goodness truth if she's sick I clean the house somebody's got to clean the house I'm gonna do it if Kaye ain't there because now I just make Kaye do but back then Kaye was too little so I did it so she was bedridden Conor and uh the girls from the church all show up in the house to clean the house right they come in and play Spot they're like what in the world not even a dishing the thing and in my my defense I had just got done didn't know they were coming and I had just got if they had got there 10 minutes sooner that place would have been a mess but they didn't they got there 10 minutes later and the place was fished blew their mind the guys at the church was actually mad they were like what have you done like clean the house now we have to but anyways they would tell her they would call her a liar they would call her all their St because there ain't no way that I would do that stuff for her there ain't no way that I could be good to her and living the life that I was living now this was a message believing people right good people absolutely wonderful people I ain't saying nothing bad about them because the truth of the matter is I was horrible and they were just stating fact okay plain and simple it's the truth but she didn't listen to it she said you don't know my husband all right you don't know my John boy you don't know him because she wasn't looking to me as a drunk she wasn't looking at me all right she was looking at me as her husband she was looking at me as a Christian she was looking at me as the guy she wanted me to be and no I haven't got there yet she's got expectation of you but I'm working on it God's working on it and that's the way God looks at you yeah he doesn't see he doesn't see the pit when Joseph was throw in the pit God didn't see the pit God saw him at the right hand of pharaoh right when he was in Piper's house God didn't see the woman trying to do all that kind of stuff he knew it was going to happen and he even knew the choices that we were going to make but that ain't the way he looks at you he looks at you as the finished product of his work it's all done so you can dance and you can laugh H because no matter what Satan throws at you and we're closing right now let's it doesn't matter what happens tomorrow it doesn't matter what happens tonight it doesn't matter what happens five minutes from now God has a deposit in the bank just for you so I want you guys to sing that song and I want you to mean it because it's the honest truth you can sing Hallelujah any how all right because no matter what
