[48:40] Jesus amen
[48:42] we uh you look at the evening time the
[48:46] evening Shadows can be a little bit
[48:49] spooky actually when the sun is going
[48:54] down and and you think you know what is
[48:57] out there you're at a familiar place but
[49:00] as the sun begins to go down the place
[49:03] that you think is that you pretty well
[49:06] know amen the Shadows begin to come in
[49:10] and begins to
[49:12] magnify everything around you and every
[49:16] every little uh noise you hear you amen
[49:20] it looks like a dark object that is that
[49:23] is there in front of you you don't know
[49:25] know what it is and your uh panoramic
[49:30] view becomes skewed because everything
[49:33] is looking different now amen and I I
[49:37] think that sometimes life can be full of
[49:41] Shadows amen I don't think I know that
[49:44] life can be full of Shadows it can cause
[49:47] you to question amen these shadows will
[49:50] cause you to question your health it'll
[49:53] cause you to question your financial
[49:55] Securities it'll cause you to question
[49:58] your marriage Shadows can come amen and
[50:02] when those Shadows come amen it makes
[50:06] you wonder because everything becomes so
[50:10] uncertain to you amen as you are there
[50:15] in in walking through this life now you
[50:19] you aren't the only ones who've ever
[50:21] been affected by the shadows of life man
[50:26] uh clouds try to hide the validity of
[50:29] taking God's word and and and taking God
[50:33] and and and believing his word amen
[50:36] these clouds of
[50:39] circumstances try to uh circumvent the
[50:43] realities of God's promises now we are a
[50:47] people who walk by faith we we are
[50:50] ordained to walk by faith our soul has
[50:53] been predestinated to walk by faith
[50:56] but these clouds will come in amen and
[50:59] they will create question marks in our
[51:03] lives these clouds will come in
[51:06] sometimes they'll make us amen a a a
[51:09] question whether God still loves us
[51:12] they'll make us question whether or not
[51:15] uh uh amen we have the Holy Ghost it'll
[51:17] make us question whether we have sended
[51:20] away our day of Grace or amen there's
[51:23] that and and and what happens is is is
[51:26] these clouds come in and and create a a
[51:31] a a a mirage if you will or create
[51:34] something that causes you to question
[51:38] the validity of your walk with God Amen
[51:43] but I I I want to tell you that's where
[51:45] you've got to keep faith in the promises
[51:48] of God's word stand upon God's word
[51:51] without shaking can you say amen amen
[51:55] you look there at Israel Israel was
[51:57] delivered supernaturally by the hand of
[51:59] God they had they had put the blood over
[52:02] the door and and upon the post and the
[52:05] death angel supernaturally had had had
[52:09] uh uh uh you know went over passed over
[52:11] their homes and God saved them and and
[52:14] God delivered Israel to million strong
[52:17] but when they got to the Red Sea the
[52:20] clouds of Doubt was trying to hinder
[52:24] them from going into the promise that
[52:27] God had already predestinated for them
[52:30] amen and before you know it though they
[52:32] came out supernaturally now they're
[52:35] sitting there wondering is God uh going
[52:38] to forsake us has God forgotten about us
[52:41] has God Amen uh or has he brought us out
[52:44] of here to die and begin to question
[52:47] amen but you see the same God that gives
[52:49] you the promise the same God who
[52:51] delivered you in the first place is the
[52:54] same one that is going to take you to
[52:56] the promised
[52:58] land and it doesn't matter if the Red
[53:00] Sea's in the way it doesn't matter if
[53:02] the army's coming it doesn't matter if
[53:04] you're hemmed in what matters is you are
[53:07] standing upon the Revelation which is
[53:11] the sunlight of God's word and the
[53:14] sunlight of God's word will lead you
[53:17] guide you oh Hallelujah he says I will
[53:20] send my angel to keep you in the way
[53:25] will be an enemy to your enemies I will
[53:27] be an adversary to your adversaries I've
[53:30] started this and I will bring it to
[53:33] pass well praise the Lord you see Moses
[53:38] god looked to Moses and said why you
[53:40] crying to me I've done giv you the
[53:42] promise you're alling you're allowing
[53:46] clouds you're allowing doubt you are
[53:49] allowing the facts of unbelief to bring
[53:54] the Shadows over your soul can you say
[53:57] amen hallelujah God says stretch forth
[53:59] that Rod amen stretch forth the rod and
[54:02] go across on dry land stretch forth the
[54:04] cross what was it it was God keeping his
[54:07] word unto Moses amen because it was
[54:11] already given unto Abraham 400 years
[54:16] earlier saying you this is your land
[54:19] you're going to go into bondage but I'm
[54:21] going to bring you back
[54:23] out well glory to God Amen if that don't
[54:26] make you want to shout amen when you're
[54:28] in your troubles you're in your trials
[54:31] you're in the situations of your life
[54:33] and the clouds are coming over you just
[54:36] remember the sunshine is still
[54:40] shining amen Elijah was had been
[54:44] faithful to the to the word of God and
[54:47] amen he was he was faithful a prophet to
[54:52] stand against Jezebel and said that it's
[54:55] not going to rain but by my word amen
[54:59] and and and and we understand if you
[55:02] remember the story and how they tried to
[55:04] kill him and they they done everything
[55:07] they could to try to bring
[55:12] elij and and to get him out of the way
[55:15] but you see he had an eternal purpose
[55:18] and the Eternal purpose had to be
[55:20] fulfilled and God was not going to allow
[55:23] his servant to die ahead of
[55:25] time can you say Amen finally God tells
[55:29] him amen it's time for rain he's seen
[55:32] the vision he gets he he he begins to
[55:35] pray and he sends his his servant amen
[55:38] now the servant's the it's a type of our
[55:41] of our carnal nature amen his servant
[55:43] the servant of of Elijah is a type of
[55:46] you and me our sinful nature our caral
[55:49] nature the nature that we were born with
[55:52] and he sends his servant and he says
[55:54] amen go out and look and see what you
[55:56] see amen and and the and the servant
[55:59] comes back and says I don't see any kind
[56:01] of rain I don't see God keeping his word
[56:03] at all Elijah says go back and look
[56:06] again amen he goes back out to look
[56:08] again and comes back in and says I don't
[56:11] see any kind of rain amen he done this
[56:14] time after time after time but Elijah
[56:18] had to stand upon the word of God
[56:21] because God had already given him the
[56:24] same the
[56:26] Lord and sometimes when you're looking
[56:28] there and your old nature amen your
[56:30] human reasoning your natural mind it's
[56:33] saying I don't see how it's possible I
[56:35] don't see God moving I don't see the
[56:37] supernatural God you have forgotten
[56:39] about I've been praying for healing I've
[56:41] been praying for deliverance I've been
[56:43] praying for my children but you've got
[56:45] to stand upon the word of God knowing
[56:50] that he's going to keep every word that
[56:53] he has spoken amen
[56:55] well praise the Lord now
[56:58] Elijah man he kept sending that servant
[57:02] that servant's go back and look and look
[57:05] and look and finally the servant came
[57:08] back and says man all I see is a little
[57:11] spot in the sky amen it's a cloud all

[58:15] word and say Lord open this Poor Boy's
[58:19] eyes so that he can see the angels that

[1:00:37] him he just simply sent a servant out
[1:00:40] and he told him he says now I want you
[1:00:42] to go and and dip in the muddy Jordan
[1:00:45] seven times and and and all of a sudden
[1:00:49] clouds of doubt now remember he went
[1:00:51] with a faith expecting to be healed okay
[1:00:56] but when he got there and the Elijah did

[1:01:11] to come out and and before you know it
[1:01:14] am man now he's he's already a little
[1:01:17] skeptical and then when the enemy or or
[1:01:20] or or or when the the Elisha's servant
[1:01:23] Gesa begin to tell him I want you to go
[1:01:26] and dip in the River Jordan all of a
[1:01:28] sudden he turn around and he says I'm

[1:02:39] talking about this this amen uh beyond
[1:02:43] the Shadows I am saying Satan can bring
[1:02:48] these situations around us to get us off
[1:02:52] of the promise of God
[1:02:56] now man when the words of religious men
[1:03:00] clouded the
[1:03:02] minds of
[1:03:04] Israel they in the wilderness and
[1:03:06] causing them man to Rebel in their
[1:03:10] hearts and they believe they Mis
[1:03:12] disbelieve the servant of
[1:03:14] God and and serpents were coming out to
[1:03:18] bite them and Destroy them and to kill
[1:03:21] them amen Moses was told by God make a
[1:03:25] Brazen Serpent and I I want you to put

[1:03:29] up there on that pole and if they will
[1:03:33] look at my
[1:03:35] remedy they can
[1:03:37] live now now now they had a choice
[1:03:41] because remember the reason the serpents
[1:03:43] are biting them is because they had a
[1:03:46] disrespect for the prophet of God and
[1:03:49] now the prophet's voice is saying God's
[1:03:52] provided a remedy
[1:03:54] if you can look and live now it took
[1:03:58] somebody going past the clouds of Doubt

[1:04:24] could live I say tonight amen or this
[1:04:27] morning the promises of God are just as
[1:04:29] real today as they've ever been but you
[1:04:31] see we are living in an age where there
[1:04:33] are rivers of unbelief amen there there
[1:04:36] there is so much skepticism there's so
[1:04:39] much unbelief there's so many things
[1:04:41] that we that that that we that we are
[1:04:44] demanding God to prove prove prove prove
[1:04:47] prove when he's already proved his word
[1:04:50] in this generation all he's looking for
[1:04:53] is a humble people amen that'll look
[1:04:55] past this nature look P well praise the
[1:04:58] Lord I I just want to say you can look
[1:05:01] and live here today amen you say now now

[1:05:08] flaws in our lives amen you can look
[1:05:11] there at your flaws you can look there
[1:05:13] at your scars you can look there at your
[1:05:15] mistakes and as you look at these flaws

[1:05:20] can Cloud up and you can say I don't see
[1:05:22] how God can use me I don't see how God
[1:05:24] can anoint me I don't see how God can
[1:05:27] move for me or or how I can be
[1:05:30] predestinated by God but I want you to
[1:05:32] also know that the
[1:05:34] flaw sometimes makes the
[1:05:38] Masterpiece Oh Glory to God sometimes
[1:05:41] it's the flaw sometimes sometimes it's
[1:05:43] the thing that you're struggling with
[1:05:44] right now that is going to make you who
[1:05:46] you are sometimes what you're going
[1:05:48] through right now God has allowed you to
[1:05:51] fall God has allowed you to Amen to you
[1:05:55] know to flounder out there he's allowed
[1:05:57] these things to take place many of times
[1:06:00] because he's going to bring amen a a
[1:06:03] testimony out of you now you're going to
[1:06:04] pay for your amen your your sins you're
[1:06:07] going to pay for your your nonsense when
[1:06:09] you walk away from God and you amen but
[1:06:11] if God allows those things sometimes
[1:06:14] amen you you you you you you can sit
[1:06:17] there in condemnation and that's a trick
[1:06:19] of the devil to condemn you and to make
[1:06:21] you feel that you're unworthy and to
[1:06:23] make you feel that you can't rise above
[1:06:25] it and to make you feel that it's all
[1:06:27] over for you amen or you can take the
[1:06:30] promises of God apply the blood of God
[1:06:33] to your mind and your heart and rise
[1:06:36] above it and become a testimony of God's
[1:06:41] divine
[1:06:42] grace well glory to God Amen I I I I say
[1:06:46] sometimes too many too many times amen
[1:06:49] we we we are too legalistic and God is
[1:06:52] looking to show himself free in
[1:06:56] you
[1:06:58] amen now many of times we can look at
[1:07:01] our scars many of times we we sin we we
[1:07:06] tend to man uh think God can't redeem
[1:07:12] Meen many times we think that God cannot
[1:07:16] you know do his work in me amen but God
[1:07:20] has at the beginning shown what he was
[1:07:22] doing through a uh uh through through
[1:07:24] Adam and Eve we found that that that no
[1:07:27] matter how great the sin was God is in
[1:07:32] the redeeming
[1:07:35] business I'm not advocating sin the
[1:07:38] Bible says Amen to to sin not but if any
[1:07:42] man does sin he has an advocate with
[1:07:45] Christ Jesus amen can you say man we we
[1:07:49] we we we have those things but many at
[1:07:52] times God is trying to show himself in a
[1:07:56] stronger light and the reason we fall
[1:08:00] too many times is we are careless we're
[1:08:03] walking in our own paths we're doing
[1:08:06] things in our own way and we fail to
[1:08:09] miss what God is
[1:08:11] doing well praise the
[1:08:13] Lord now brother brandom taught us that
[1:08:18] God inflicted the scar upon
[1:08:22] Adam in order to
[1:08:24] bring a testimony in order to bring out
[1:08:28] the
[1:08:29] bride God
[1:08:32] inflicted a
[1:08:35] scar Adam in a perfect Edom had a scar
[1:08:40] did you know that Jesus when we get to
[1:08:42] heaven Jesus will have his
[1:08:44] scars the scars will be
[1:08:47] trophies that's what the prophet said
[1:08:49] the prophet said when we get there he
[1:08:51] will have scars the those will be scars
[1:08:54] of redemption Adam was scarred but out
[1:08:58] of the scar well bless the name of the
[1:09:01] Lord out of the scar came the most
[1:09:05] beautiful woman that was ever on earth
[1:09:08] amen out of the scar came amen a
[1:09:12] masterpiece God created
[1:09:15] himself well praise the
[1:09:18] lord well praise the Lord I say there's
[1:09:22] something about Redemption when God
[1:09:24] wants to do something beautiful I just
[1:09:26] want to let the devil know you can cloud
[1:09:28] my mind all you want to you can cloud my
[1:09:30] heart all you want to but I am living
[1:09:33] with a promise I'm living under a
[1:09:37] predestination I am going to rise above
[1:09:40] it all God's word cannot
[1:09:44] fail can you say
[1:09:47] amen amen there's a song Amen that was
[1:09:52] sung when I was a kid
[1:09:54] the the CHT says when all have Forsaken
[1:09:57] and everything is taken the whole
[1:10:00] world's been shaken and you've got to
[1:10:03] make it
[1:10:04] without but where there's a flicker of
[1:10:06] sunlight on the far side of midnight
[1:10:09] stands
[1:10:10] Jesus beyond the shadow of a doubt can
[1:10:15] you say Amen brother Brandon would talk
[1:10:17] about superstitious mountain and brother
[1:10:20] brandham heard of this great Mountain
[1:10:23] called superstitious mountain he had
[1:10:26] heard it for so long he had read about
[1:10:27] it anden the hell the the the mountain
[1:10:31] held so much of a mystery many did not
[1:10:34] want to go into the mountain it was
[1:10:36] because of so many legends that were
[1:10:38] told about it that the the Native
[1:10:40] Americans the Indians would wouldn't
[1:10:42] even go near it amen because of of of of
[1:10:46] what the uh the Spanish had done to them
[1:10:49] and treated them and they claimed there
[1:10:51] were evil spirits that that lived in
[1:10:54] that suspicious Mountain many had come
[1:10:56] into that mountain and died and never
[1:10:59] could find their way out and and and
[1:11:01] brother brandham says he was hunting one
[1:11:03] time and he man and he got up close to
[1:11:06] superstitious mountain as he was over
[1:11:09] there and he had his flashlight and he
[1:11:11] was looking at suspicious mountain with
[1:11:13] that with that flashlight and with all
[1:11:15] the memories and all of the stories that
[1:11:17] he had heard and he goes oh that is
[1:11:20] spooky that's a spooky Mountain that's
[1:11:22] amen I
[1:11:24] and and he was amen uh uh uh you know he
[1:11:28] he says it as he got up so close he says
[1:11:31] amen the great ghostly Shadow hung uh at
[1:11:35] the east of him and and he and as he had
[1:11:37] looked with his own flashlight amen he
[1:11:39] says oh this is awfully spooky he says I
[1:11:42] couldn't wait to see superstitious
[1:11:43] mountain I had to go up there but my
[1:11:46] flashlight was nothing and I couldn't
[1:11:47] see nothing the great spooky shadows and
[1:11:50] the men that's been killed on that
[1:11:51] mountain and they searching for gold and
[1:11:53] and held many superstitions and and and
[1:11:57] truly as I tried with my flashlight I
[1:12:00] looked around and I couldn't see nothing
[1:12:01] everything was scary you you you know
[1:12:04] what I did he said I just sat still I
[1:12:07] sat still until the sun come up and when
[1:12:10] the sun which is the king of all light
[1:12:12] when it raised up my little flashlight
[1:12:14] didn't play anything all the Spooks had
[1:12:17] left he said I seen the supicious
[1:12:21] mountain it wasn't spooky I was ready to
[1:12:24] walk into it to discover it for myself
[1:12:28] because the great light the sun which is
[1:12:30] which is spoken word of God God said let
[1:12:34] there be light and that's the words of
[1:12:36] God made manifest and when it shed it
[1:12:40] all the Spooks left well glory to God he
[1:12:45] says after a while the Majesty of the
[1:12:46] son began to move upon the darkness and
[1:12:48] when it did it separated the darkness
[1:12:50] from the light and pressed the darkness
[1:12:52] back finally she raised to her highness
[1:12:55] up over the top of the mountain and it
[1:12:57] showed Superstition just what it was it
[1:13:00] lit up it showed what it was all the
[1:13:03] Spooks and all the fears that I had of
[1:13:05] the Superstition when the Sun was
[1:13:08] shining in its power upon it it all well
[1:13:12] praise the Lord it all fled away if I
[1:13:16] could talk to you here this morning amen
[1:13:18] you let the sunlight of divine
[1:13:21] revelation come upon you brother amen
[1:13:23] all of the Superstition all of the fear
[1:13:27] all of the Spooks everything will walk
[1:13:30] away from your life amen and you'll
[1:13:32] begin to see God in his Divine Purpose
[1:13:35] over your life amen the reason why you
[1:13:37] can't fulfill your purpose today is
[1:13:39] because you are looking at something
[1:13:41] spooky you're looking at your carnal
[1:13:43] nature you're looking at things and says
[1:13:46] I just don't know many have died many
[1:13:47] have failed many have fa amen but I want
[1:13:50] to tell you let the sunlight of God's
[1:13:52] Divine Purpose come upon your life and
[1:13:55] you'll see that that old nature ain't
[1:13:57] nothing to you you can conquer that
[1:13:59] nature you can conquer that sick
[1:14:03] well Hallelujah let the sunlight reflect
[1:14:07] upon who you
[1:14:10] are
[1:14:12] Hallelujah he says the son is the king
[1:14:14] of all light on this Earth in the
[1:14:17] natural light and no matter how much
[1:14:19] artificial light we can have how many
[1:14:21] great electric Rays we can produce
[1:14:23] when the Sun rises all the rest of them
[1:14:25] dim out and that's the same thing it is
[1:14:28] with the word of God when the word of
[1:14:29] God Rises all the superstitions all the
[1:14:32] denominational fanaticism all the things
[1:14:35] spread away and it shows just exactly
[1:14:38] what it is God in the beginning said let
[1:14:41] there be light and light only comes the
[1:14:44] True Light the king light comes by the
[1:14:47] word of God when God separated the light
[1:14:50] from the darkness in the beginning and
[1:14:52] God and the the word of God was made
[1:14:54] manifest it always separates the light
[1:14:58] from the darkness people can rise up
[1:15:00] with this that or the other isms can
[1:15:02] rise communism and fascism and all these
[1:15:05] other isms can rise superstitious and
[1:15:07] Cults and whatever it might be they
[1:15:10] might rise up but when the king light of
[1:15:12] the Bible raises up all superstitions
[1:15:16] all are y'all hearing me tonight amen it
[1:15:19] says but you see we know it's there but
[1:15:22] until it's Vindicated proves its light
[1:15:25] there is no right to argue against it
[1:15:28] because it shuts all other light out can
[1:15:32] I hear an
[1:15:34] amen hallelujah amen now it brings light
[1:15:40] light brings
[1:15:41] faith brother Brandon would say it this
[1:15:44] way he says faith is what you do not
[1:15:47] see it's what you believe that you do
[1:15:51] not see but there's some something
[1:15:53] inside of you that sees it and God
[1:15:57] that's inside sees his own word being
[1:16:00] made manifest but you couldn't reason it
[1:16:04] there's no way to do it you never can be
[1:16:07] God can never be reasoned because he's
[1:16:09] Beyond reasoning he's God and we just
[1:16:12] have to take what he says about it and
[1:16:16] call it the
[1:16:17] truth can you say Amen because it's the
[1:16:21] light now
[1:16:24] Superstition many times we look am man
[1:16:27] and we look at this gloom and the things
[1:16:30] that maybe in your trial or as I say I I
[1:16:34] and again I'm not a I I I am not
[1:16:36] condoning saying that you know God
[1:16:39] causes you to go out in sin or God
[1:16:41] causes you to walk away or God you know
[1:16:43] you you do that because amen you're not
[1:16:46] following the way that you should follow
[1:16:48] but God allows these things so that he
[1:16:52] can bring a purpose about in our
[1:16:55] lives well praise the Lord can you say
[1:16:58] Amen it was Moses and his and his
[1:17:01] apparent Rebellion amen when when when
[1:17:03] when he went out there and tried to do
[1:17:05] it in his own self and and there he
[1:17:07] killed the Egyptian takes off from the
[1:17:09] backside of the desert for 40 years but
[1:17:11] when God Appears to him again now Moses
[1:17:14] he's got an experience with God he's
[1:17:16] able to look back at his failures and
[1:17:19] says I'm going to trust God regardless
[1:17:22] amen hallelujah oh do we have anybody
[1:17:24] that's going to trust
[1:17:26] God do we have anybody that says I am
[1:17:30] willing to look past the clouds of Doubt
[1:17:34] to believe God hallelujah amen
[1:17:38] hallelujah brother brenman says if you
[1:17:39] could just break that crust of the
[1:17:42] Shadow of Doubt he said that's the only
[1:17:46] thing that's keeping you from receiving
[1:17:50] if you could break past
[1:17:53] the
[1:17:54] Shadows amen
[1:17:57] now as we go along the Gloom that held
[1:18:01] over the Earth at the beginning is this
[1:18:03] okay here this
[1:18:05] morning the Gloom the shadows of death
[1:18:08] and fear and
[1:18:09] uncertainty the clouds of doubt and
[1:18:12] Gloom hung over the Earth amen
[1:18:17] now this was when at this is the time
[1:18:21] that God says let there be light
[1:18:23] now the prophet taught
[1:18:25] us that when God said let there be light
[1:18:29] he said there were already
[1:18:31] seeds under the water there were already
[1:18:35] seeds from another
[1:18:37] civilization so when God said let there
[1:18:40] be light all he had to do was to remove
[1:18:43] the
[1:18:44] darkness let the light shine and the
[1:18:49] seeds that were already in the ground
[1:18:55] Hallelujah I I can tell I I I I I I must
[1:18:59] be going a little bit too slow for y'all
[1:19:00] here this morning I'm saying the seeds
[1:19:04] were already under the that water on now
[1:19:10] God just had to bring light on the
[1:19:12] subject remove it and the seeds that
[1:19:15] were already there begin to
[1:19:21] grow
[1:19:23] Hallelujah you know you you were that
[1:19:25] way
[1:19:26] too you were in sin you were in the mck
[1:19:30] and the M well praise the
[1:19:33] Lord many of times we we we look at
[1:19:36] ourselves and we amen uh uh we were
[1:19:41] scarred we we were hurt maybe we were
[1:19:44] abused when we were a child maybe maybe
[1:19:48] we were molested or maybe we amen had
[1:19:51] had things that that were brought
[1:19:54] against us and and it scarred us
[1:19:57] emotionally scarred us physically it it
[1:20:01] scarice but you see you look at the
[1:20:04] scars and there's too many times when we
[1:20:07] just look at the scars and don't allow
[1:20:09] the sunlight come and let the Holy
[1:20:11] Spirit come in and bring the seeds of
[1:20:13] life to up can you say Amen but you see
[1:20:16] that's what God designed in the earth
[1:20:19] when he said let there be and then let
[1:20:20] the seeds bring forth after its kind
[1:20:23] amen it was to bring it was to bring the
[1:20:27] bring life it was to bring the fruit it
[1:20:29] was to bring what God intended it to be
[1:20:32] regardless of what the circumstances
[1:20:34] around it were at the light was giving
[1:20:37] it the permission to rise above
[1:20:41] it
[1:20:42] now
[1:20:44] man I as I think of this Amen in spite
[1:20:49] of the shadowy clouds there were the
[1:20:51] seeds brother brandham would put it this
[1:20:53] way he says the first light that was
[1:20:55] ever given in the Earth was God's spoken
[1:20:57] word the first light that was ever that
[1:20:59] ever struck the Earth was God's word he
[1:21:02] said let there be light and there was
[1:21:03] light it turned Darkness into light and
[1:21:07] in order to bring forth the creation of
[1:21:08] joy and life upon the Earth then the
[1:21:11] spirit of God is moving with love and
[1:21:13] compassion and that great day the first
[1:21:15] day of the dawn of creation upon the
[1:21:17] Earth the Sun Rose and swept across its
[1:21:19] rays and dried up the waters with the
[1:21:21] Earth from the Earth and made it an
[1:21:24] atmosphere above for uh for its first
[1:21:27] time it was going to bring joy and life
[1:21:31] to the Earth by a
[1:21:34] seed that was a
[1:21:37] great
[1:21:40] hour he
[1:21:42] took
[1:21:45] Brokenness now the prophet would say
[1:21:47] that he' done this with
[1:21:49] compassion and love he could take
[1:21:54] Brokenness and because he knew there was
[1:21:57] the seed on the inside he could bring
[1:22:01] that to life and bring the
[1:22:04] beauty you Easter that's what that's
[1:22:07] what Easter was at God come in when the
[1:22:09] Earth was gloomy when the Earth was full
[1:22:12] of sin when man was so far away from the
[1:22:17] sunlight of God it looked like it was so
[1:22:20] so far away
[1:22:23] and yet God allowed the sunrise to come
[1:22:26] on that Easter
[1:22:27] morning that Easter morning it brought a
[1:22:30] hope into human heart like no other time
[1:22:34] it would be the hope now they would
[1:22:36] still live in a scarred body they would
[1:22:39] still live and die in the natural but
[1:22:42] the soul had something to live
[1:22:45] for the soul there was a communication
[1:22:49] open back between he and God oh can you
[1:22:53] say amen amen I look there at I look
[1:22:56] there at Jesus and there he was he was
[1:22:59] beat and and and and he was amen bruised
[1:23:03] and anden he was mashed and he was cut
[1:23:08] and handfuls of beard were pulled from
[1:23:11] his face he was spat upon he was made
[1:23:14] fun of he was he was scarred beyond
[1:23:20] recognition but God took the scars God
[1:23:23] took the the pain and God brought about
[1:23:28] a resurrection for you and
[1:23:33] me and it was a
[1:23:35] declaration it was a declaration to all
[1:23:38] of us human beings it was a declaration
[1:23:41] God gave a declaration that day it gave
[1:23:44] a hope that as God raised this human
[1:23:48] being when God raised this human being
[1:23:51] from the grave when he raised him from
[1:23:53] all of the scars and the pain when God
[1:23:56] raised him despite those that hated him
[1:24:00] when God raised him despite amen all of
[1:24:03] those who had rejected him and God
[1:24:06] raised him out of that grave Hallelujah
[1:24:10] it was a blessed hope to you and to me
[1:24:13] saying no matter what the clouds say no
[1:24:17] matter what Humanity says no matter the
[1:24:21] scars or the pain
[1:24:23] amen I have a hope God raised him up so
[1:24:27] that he could Raise Me
[1:24:33] Up
[1:24:35] Hallelujah because we know that those
[1:24:37] scars that came were not for
[1:24:41] himself he took your
[1:24:44] scars he took your
[1:24:47] pain he took your
[1:24:50] questions he took your
[1:24:53] fears he took your doubts he took
[1:24:57] everything concerning you was placed
[1:25:01] upon him and when God raised him from
[1:25:04] the dead that was a
[1:25:06] declaration that you shall raise
[1:25:10] too he was wounded for my
[1:25:13] transgressions can you say amen he was
[1:25:16] bruis for
[1:25:18] [Applause]
[1:25:21] me

[1:25:27] away that takes that old condemnation
[1:25:31] spirit that wants to come in and condemn
[1:25:34] and condemn and condemn and condemn it
[1:25:37] moves it out of the way because he took
[1:25:40] the penalty and the pain for
[1:25:47] me I've still got the scars yes I've got
[1:25:51] the scars of of my transgressions memory

[1:26:06] for the blood of Jesus Christ he's not
[1:26:09] looking at my failure he's not looking
[1:26:12] at my shame he's not looking at my
[1:26:14] questions he is bringing about the
[1:26:20] Masterpiece who had the
[1:26:23] scar Adam took the
[1:26:25] scar so that I could come

[1:31:53] wouldn't accept
[1:31:55] it they said why wouldn't you accept
[1:31:59] it she said I might not have sung hymns
[1:32:01] to praise the the name of
[1:32:05] God if it weren't for the Affliction
[1:32:07] that I have maybe maybe I wouldn't have
[1:32:11] come back to God or I wouldn't or I
[1:32:14] would have left my God Amen she says if
[1:32:19] I had been distracted by the beautiful
[1:32:21] things that interesting things about me
[1:32:24] amen but then she turns around and they
[1:32:27] said well what if you get on the other

[1:32:33] what what if you get on the other side
[1:32:36] and all of this you're still
[1:32:39] blind that's when she stood up or she

[1:32:47] him I shall know him and redeem by his
[1:32:51] side I shall stand I shall know him I

[1:33:53] didn't have my flaws if I didn't have my
[1:33:57] then then I could and before you know
[1:34:00] it a cloud comes back
[1:34:04] over amen the Apostle Paul comes to
[1:34:08] Christ he says he says he prayed over
[1:34:11] and over he says I'm asking that this
[1:34:13] that this Thorn In the Flesh pass from
[1:34:15] me take it from me Jesus appeared to him

[1:34:34] there in 2 Corinthians 11 and 24 it says
[1:34:37] of the Jews five times received I 40
[1:34:40] Stripes save one Thrice I was beaten
[1:34:42] with rods and once I was stoned Thrice I
[1:34:45] was I suffered shipwreck a night and a
[1:34:47] day I have been in the deep in

[1:35:31] concerns mine

[1:35:35] pressure of failure clouded the Apostle
[1:35:38] Paul's
[1:35:41] mind do you not feel that the rejection
[1:35:45] and despised by his friends of all Asia
[1:35:48] as he said has forsaken him Deus
[1:35:52] feels like he's more spiritual than me
[1:35:55] can you say
[1:35:56] Amen but the Apostle Paul turns in
[1:35:59] Philippians 1 and 12 he says I would ye
[1:36:03] should not you should understand
[1:36:04] Brethren that the things which have
[1:36:07] happen unto me have fallen out rather
[1:36:08] under the furtherance of the Gospel so
[1:36:10] that my Bonds in Christ are manifest in
[1:36:12] all of the palace and all of the other
[1:36:15] places and many of the brethren in the

[1:38:12] wounds now I I keep coming right back to
[1:38:15] that but these Shadows sometimes that

[1:38:21] M
[1:38:23] Hallelujah is that
[1:38:26] right

[1:38:30] prophecies wrote about him and spoke
[1:38:32] over him and amen Christ shall sit upon
[1:38:36] the throne of David and Jesus himself
[1:38:38] said he's the root and The Offspring of
[1:38:40] David and David loved God with all of
[1:38:43] his heart he was a man after God's Own
[1:38:45] Heart and Oh my he wrote so many
[1:38:48] wonderful songs to God most of the
[1:38:50] Psalms are written WR by
[1:38:54] David but David had a
[1:38:57] flaw amen he killed Uriah the
[1:39:05] hittite kill
[1:39:07] him
[1:39:10] Hallelujah it was a
[1:39:13] self-inflicted
[1:39:17] wound it would be a
[1:39:20] scar
[1:39:23] and David
[1:39:25] would look there and as the prophet
[1:39:28] would come to David and say thou art the
[1:39:32] man thus saith the Lord of God of Israel
[1:39:36] I anointed thee King over Israel I
[1:39:38] delivered thee out of the hand of
[1:39:41] Saul I gave thee thy Master's house and
[1:39:44] thy Master's wives into thy
[1:39:47] bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel
[1:39:50] and and
[1:39:52] Judah and if that had been too little I
[1:39:54] would have I would moreover have given

[1:46:59] Jesus man taking sides with Jesus
[1:47:02] brother Brandon would say but Jesus they
[1:47:04] tried to find every little Shadow they
[1:47:07] could find to try to belittle him in the
[1:47:09] sight of the
[1:47:10] people and that's what the devil wants

[1:47:32] men of God act like men of God live like
[1:47:35] men of God because the devil your
[1:47:37] adversary is going around like a roaring
[1:47:39] lion trying to devour what he can why
[1:47:43] did they do this they were jealous of
[1:47:44] him that's the reason they tried to
[1:47:47] belittle him they was jealous of his
[1:47:49] ministry the reason and they were trying
[1:47:50] to belittle he had the ministry of God
[1:47:53] they knew that but it was contrary to
[1:47:55] their Creeds so they were trying to
[1:47:57] belittle him and make make everything he
[1:47:59] every little flaw that they could find
[1:48:02] and give him out of the way they wanted
[1:48:06] him to quit they wanted the people to
[1:48:08] denounce him they wanted to say now this
[1:48:10] guy's nothing look at here now there he
[1:48:13] is he did
[1:48:14] this and you know that's not right
[1:48:17] you've been taught all your all of our
[1:48:19] life that we should believe the elders
[1:48:22] and here he is stood right there and
[1:48:24] bald the Elder out he disagreed with the
[1:48:27] traditions of the
[1:48:30] fathers that we've been taught to
[1:48:32] believe the tradition of the fathers and
[1:48:34] we've been taught that by each Rabbi all
[1:48:36] these years through and here this man's
[1:48:38] coming around and disagreeing with him W
[1:48:41] the man like that ain't fit to be a
[1:48:43] preacher see they were trying to
[1:48:45] belittle him but in all that the ones
[1:48:49] that believed him loved him
[1:48:51] and seen all his scriptural Miracle
[1:48:53] signs would not be hindered by them no
[1:48:56] sir them who believed him believed him
[1:49:00] those who loved him stood by him and
[1:49:03] they would not see what others pointed
[1:49:06] out to them can you say
[1:49:09] Amen Jesus that long waited
[1:49:13] Messiah there he
[1:49:15] comes there he comes he's Healing The
[1:49:18] Sick he's ra in the
[1:49:21] dead Spirit of the Lord God is upon Him
[1:49:25] scriptures coming to
[1:49:28] pass it looks so beautiful
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:32] oh but then when he
[1:49:35] died the 12
[1:49:39] disciples or the 11 disciples were
[1:49:42] thinking we thought that he was the one
[1:49:44] clouds try to come over their eyes we
[1:49:49] thought
[1:49:51] we had hoped we were with him for three
[1:49:54] and a half
[1:49:56] years
[1:50:03] man there were a couple disciples
[1:50:05] walking on the road to
[1:50:07] EMAs Jesus caught up with him why you
[1:50:11] guys so sad HH have you not heard Jesus
[1:50:14] we thought he was the Messiah and they
[1:50:16] killed
[1:50:17] him we had thought Jesus said well you
[1:50:20] don't
[1:50:23] say he says oh you slow of heart you act
[1:50:27] like
[1:50:30] fools they looked over to him saying
[1:50:32] what are you talking
[1:50:34] about we were with him we ate with him
[1:50:37] we know this guy's a good guy he was our
[1:50:39] Messiah we
[1:50:41] thought Jesus says I agree with you I do
[1:50:44] I
[1:50:45] do but what you're missing here is he
[1:50:49] had to go go into the
[1:50:52] ground and then he started all the way
[1:50:55] back with
[1:50:56] Moses and started giving the light of
[1:50:59] the scripture and before you know it all
[1:51:03] the clouds of
[1:51:05] Doubt were being pushed
[1:51:10] away and they begin to start thinking
[1:51:14] something there's there there's
[1:51:16] something going
[1:51:18] on and when he went into that house and
[1:51:21] he broke that bread clouds
[1:51:26] left they said you're the
[1:51:34] one oh if we could just see that we're

[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:22] you're the
[2:04:24] only one true
[2:04:32] lover as they just play
[2:04:36] softly the reason you love him so much
[2:04:44] today is because he's proven himself
[2:04:47] faithful
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:53] the reason you have
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:04:58] such theeman expressions of
[2:05:02] Love is because when you should be in
[2:05:05] the scrap
[2:05:06] peeps in the
[2:05:10] dumb you're not
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:17] there
[2:05:19] [Music]
[2:05:21] and when you look at yourself
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:26] now there's always going to be a cloud
[2:05:28] if you're just constantly looking at
[2:05:33] you it's the reason
[2:05:35] why we should never look at another
[2:05:37] man's Doctrine we should never look at
[2:05:40] another man's it's it's a
[2:05:44] cloud we look at one Doctrine and that's
[2:05:47] the doctrine of redemption
[2:05:50] that's the love of Christ so shed and
[2:05:53] that's what the prophet brought us was a
[2:05:56] living reality of Jesus and that's why
[2:06:00] we
[2:06:02] want the power of the Holy Spirit does
[2:06:05] so come upon us I believe old things are
[2:06:08] changed are passed away all things have
[2:06:11] become new
[2:06:14] why because he's able to remove all
[2:06:17] clouds all
[2:06:20] offense all wrongs all
[2:06:24] sins and just as quickly just as
[2:06:29] quickly as you say I'm wrong God
[2:06:33] says and I also
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:37] say that your sin is no
[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:43] more it's no wonder the prophet of God
[2:06:46] says it it doesn't necessarily take
[2:06:49] it it doesn't
[2:06:52] necessarily come and beating an altar no
[2:06:55] no it don't it don't take
[2:06:58] that when your heart's true before
[2:07:02] God and you're repen of of it it's that
[2:07:07] quick hitting yourself there takes dying
[2:07:13] out to where Sin is Sin and you're no
[2:07:15] longer trying to justify it you're
[2:07:17] you're right there before him saying I
[2:07:20] you wrestle wrestle that thing out and
[2:07:22] sometimes you have to stay at that altar
[2:07:24] until you have wrestled the thing
