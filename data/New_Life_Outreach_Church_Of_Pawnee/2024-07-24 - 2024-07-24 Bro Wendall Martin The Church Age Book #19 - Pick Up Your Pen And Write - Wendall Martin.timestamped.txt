[29:41] way down to the very the very last line
[29:45] and um um now this this here um the
[29:50] angel of the Lord had told Brother
[29:52] brandham to pick up his pen and so um he
[29:56] is going to uh uh write his pen as the
[30:01] as the Lord instructs him um and so the
[30:05] Lord had given this to him at in back in
[30:09] um uh I it was back in
[30:13] 1962 it's where the he he be is the
[30:16] first time that he had he had read it
[30:19] and then he also and that was in the U
[30:21] original the spoken word is the Original
[30:23] Seed and um and then he puts it in the
[30:26] church age book and there's there's
[30:29] going to be and I'm not going to dissect
[30:31] uh uh too much of it we have already
[30:33] went through some of this uh you're
[30:35] going to see some that we have read some
[30:37] of this the first two pages but I just
[30:39] want to read the whole the whole message
[30:42] that the angel of the lord gave him
[30:45] because he was this was at a at a very
[30:47] uh specific uh the turning point this
[30:50] was the third pool coming in and the
[30:53] prophet and the angel of the Lord Was
[30:55] preparing that Prophet for that and so
[30:58] uh the original the spoken words The
[31:00] Original Seed um you know it was um uh
[31:06] let's see it was I know it was in ' 62 I
[31:08] believe it was at the end of 62 it is is
[31:12] where I believe that was um and then of
[31:15] course the opening of the seals uh
[31:18] happened there I believe in March U 63
[31:22] so um this was this was very pivotable
[31:26] uh pivotal and and so I just want us to
[31:29] to read this tonight um any questions
[31:32] just make sure you uh you know we're
[31:34] we're we're free and then and if you you
[31:38] know if you want you're free to speak
[31:39] and if you want to write it down do so
[31:41] and give it to me and uh we'll address
[31:45] that at another time uh or at the end of
[31:47] the service tonight all right it says so
[31:50] one night as I was seeking the Lord the
[31:52] Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen
[31:55] and write as I grasp the pen to write
[31:59] his Spirit gave me a message for the
[32:01] church I want to bring it to you it has
[32:05] to do with the word and the bride here
[32:08] is what I am trying to say to you the
[32:11] law of
[32:13] reproduction is that each
[32:16] species brings forth after its kind
[32:20] according to Genesis 111 and God said
[32:24] let the Earth bring forth grass and the
[32:27] herb you'll Ying seed and the fruit uh
[32:30] tree yielding fruit after its kind whose
[32:33] seed is in itself upon the Earth and it
[32:36] was so whatever life was in the seed
[32:40] came forth into a plant and then into
[32:44] Fruit the very same law applies to the
[32:48] church today whatever seed started the
[32:51] church will come forth and be like the
[32:55] Original Seed because it is the same
[32:57] seed
[32:58] in these last days the true bride Church
[33:01] Christ seed will come to The
[33:04] Headstone and she will be a super Church
[33:07] a super race as she nears him now y'all
[33:11] remember what we've as we have been uh
[33:13] as I've taken a couple of services
[33:15] lately amen upon the upon the Capstone
[33:18] he's talking about that headstone coming
[33:20] down this is the adoption time this is
[33:23] the this is the time of of sunship that
[33:27] that the that that God has been waited
[33:30] that all of the church ages have been
[33:33] waiting on is when that Christ The
[33:36] Living Word would come down and cap the
[33:38] church not in a baptism of the Holy
[33:42] Ghost but where the Holy Ghost himself
[33:45] the logos the very life of that word
[33:50] coming down upon us this is the age
[33:53] where the pillar of fire which is the
[33:56] logos amen has returned to Earth to
[34:00] reveal the word no other age had that
[34:04] like this age amen this is the age of
[34:08] the opening of the book this is the age
[34:10] where God has literally opened the
[34:13] entire scheme of things and shown what
[34:16] is going on and so so this is not just
[34:20] another filling this is not just another
[34:23] amen tongues or interpretation this is
[34:26] the Holy Ghost
[34:28] himself this is the what brother Brandon
[34:31] would call the word coming of Christ so
[34:34] so keep that in your mind amen as we
[34:37] read it again and in these last days the
[34:39] true bride Church Christ seed will come
[34:43] to The Headstone and she will be a super
[34:47] Church a super race as she nears him and
[34:51] they in the bride will be so much like
[34:54] him that they will even be in his very
[34:57] image
[34:58] this is in order to be United with him
[35:01] they will be one they will be the very
[35:04] manifestation of the word of the Living
[35:08] God oh bless the Lord denominations
[35:11] can't produce this it's the wrong seed
[35:14] they will produce their Creeds their
[35:16] dogmas and and mixed with the word and
[35:19] this mizing will bring forth a hybrid
[35:22] product the first son Adam was the
[35:25] spoken seed word of God he was given a
[35:28] bride to reproduce himself that is why
[35:32] the bride was given to him to reproduce
[35:34] himself to produce another Son of God
[35:37] but she fell she fell by H hybridization
[35:41] and she caused him to Die the second son
[35:45] Jesus also a spoken words uh seed word
[35:48] of God was given a bride like as was
[35:52] Adam but before he could marry her she
[35:56] also had fallen she like Adam's wife was
[35:59] put to the test whether she would
[36:01] believe the word of God and live or
[36:04] doubt the word and die she doubted and
[36:07] she left the word she died from a little
[36:10] group of the true uh seed of the word
[36:15] God will present Christ with a beloved
[36:18] bride she is a virgin of his word she
[36:22] she is a virgin because she knows no uh
[36:26] man-made Creeds or dogmas
[36:29] by and through the members of the Bride
[36:31] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[36:33] of God to be manifest in the Virgin The
[36:37] Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary
[36:40] but that word uh of Promise was he
[36:44] himself to be made manifest God made
[36:48] manifest now just I want you to watch
[36:50] the language the language and I and and
[36:53] and and sometimes I wonder um I just
[36:56] can't quite get it the way I I I I would
[36:59] I you know in in preaching the the this
[37:03] paragraph right here is what every
[37:05] preacher in the message is trying to get
[37:06] to the people to get them to understand
[37:09] what God is doing because we're not the
[37:11] Virgin Mary but we are the very bride of
[37:15] Jesus Christ and in this in this
[37:19] physical vessel here Christ is wanting
[37:22] to live his very life the supernatural
[37:27] brother bradam said we talked about
[37:29] angels here uh uh uh the you know last
[37:32] service the brother bradam says that the
[37:35] angels will be so common among the bride
[37:39] he says it'll be just like television he
[37:42] said just as television is amen and and
[37:45] and and how that that television I mean
[37:47] you can
[37:48] just you can talk to people all over the
[37:51] world Wireless He said angels will be
[37:54] that Glory that that kind of Glory will
[37:56] be upon the church in these last days
[37:59] amen it says the Word of Promise came to
[38:02] Virgin Mary a amen but that Word of
[38:06] Promise was he himself to be made
[38:09] manifest God was made manifest he
[38:12] himself acted at that time and fulfilled
[38:17] his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it
[38:20] was an angel that brought her the
[38:23] message but the Angel's message was the
[38:26] word of God Isaiah 9:6 for and he
[38:30] fulfilled at that time all that was
[38:32] written of him because she accepted his
[38:35] word to her the members of the Virgin
[38:38] bride will love him they will have his
[38:40] potentials for he is their head and all
[38:44] power belongs to him they are subject to
[38:46] him as members of our bodies are subject
[38:49] to our heads notice the harmony of the
[38:52] father and the son Jesus never done
[38:54] anything until he was first uh showed
[38:58] him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony
[39:03] is now to exist between the groom and
[39:05] his bride he shows her his Word of Life
[39:08] she receives it she never doubts it
[39:11] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[39:14] death for if the seed be planted the
[39:17] word will raise it up again here is the
[39:20] secret of this the word is in the bride
[39:24] as it was in Mary the bride has the mind
[39:27] of Christ for she knows what he wants
[39:30] done with the word she performs the
[39:34] command of the word in his name for she
[39:38] has thus sayeth the Lord then the word
[39:41] is quickened by the spirit and it comes
[39:44] to pass like a seed that is planted and
[39:48] watered it comes to full Harvest serving
[39:50] its purpose isn't that just beautiful
[39:53] those last few paragraphs are
[39:55] incredible amen because we are taking
[39:58] his words into our lives we're taking
[40:01] his words into the womb of our heart and
[40:03] there is nothing impossible when that
[40:05] Supernatural God comes and makes that
[40:08] word to live it says those in the bride
[40:10] do only his will no one else can make
[40:13] them do otherwise they have thus saith
[40:16] the Lord or they keep still they know
[40:18] that it has to be God in them doing the
[40:20] works fulfilling his own
[40:22] word he did not complete all his work
[40:25] while his while in his Earth Earthly
[40:27] Ministry so now he works in and through
[40:31] the bride she knows that for it was not
[40:35] yet time for him to do certain things
[40:38] that he must now do but he will now
[40:41] fulfill through the bride that work
[40:43] which he left for this specific time now
[40:46] let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our
[40:49] promised land is coming in sight even as
[40:51] theirs did now Joshua means savior a
[40:55] Jehovah Savior and he represents the end
[40:58] time leader that will come to the church
[41:00] even as Paul Come A came as the original
[41:04] leader Caleb represents those that
[41:06] stayed true with
[41:08] Joshua remember God had started Israel
[41:11] as a virgin with his word but they
[41:14] wanted something different so the last
[41:16] day so did the last day Church notice
[41:19] how God did not move Israel uh or let
[41:23] her go into the promised land until it
[41:25] was his own appointed time
[41:27] now the people might have put pressure
[41:30] on Joshua the leader and said the land
[41:33] is ours let's go and take it Joshua
[41:36] you're all through we must have you must
[41:38] have lost your commission you don't have
[41:41] the power you used to have you used to
[41:43] hear from God and and and know the will
[41:46] of God and act quickly something is
[41:49] wrong with you but Joshua was a god-sent
[41:53] prophet and he knew the promises of God
[41:56] so he he waited for them he waited for a
[41:59] clearcut decision from God when the time
[42:02] come to move God placed the leadership
[42:05] in Joshua's hands because he had stayed
[42:08] with the word God could trust Joshua but
[42:12] not the others so it will repeat in this
[42:16] last day the same problem the same
[42:18] pressures now once again I want us to go
[42:21] back when did the when did the Lord come
[42:24] and tell brother brandom to pick up the
[42:25] pen this was right before the third
[42:29] pool now you got to understand the full
[42:31] scope of things because all of these
[42:33] other ministers had already come up
[42:36] using the sign old Roberts was using he
[42:38] had a sign in his hand we had we had uh
[42:41] Allan and and oh my goodness we had
[42:45] dozens amen dozens of uh Faith healers
[42:49] that were out there and they and they
[42:51] were now starting to they were just a
[42:54] dime a dozen everywhere amen and they
[42:57] they had they had done so much gimmicky
[42:59] and pulling for money until they had
[43:02] brought a bad name to the to the healing
[43:05] movement altogether it had gotten to a
[43:07] point to where it was a money-making
[43:09] scheme and these guys were well amen and
[43:13] brother brandham was sort of caught
[43:14] right in it and here he's the prophet
[43:17] not not not that he was caught in in the
[43:19] uh you know in in the money schemes and
[43:21] all that it was just he was just thrown
[43:23] right in there uh uh with that amen but
[43:28] his purpose was not he was not sent to
[43:31] Earth for the healing of the sick he was
[43:34] not sent to the Earth for discernment he
[43:37] was sent to the Earth to pull out a
[43:41] bride and so so brother so the Angel's
[43:44] telling them now amen all of these guys
[43:47] are ready come on let's go let's let
[43:49] let's let's do something but brother
[43:51] bradam could do no more than what God
[43:54] had given him but yet he kept telling
[43:57] him the third pull now back in 56 is
[44:00] when God gave him the vision that
[44:01] there's going to be the first pull uh
[44:03] which would be you know the the the the
[44:05] sign in the hand and then there would be
[44:06] the uh the first pull the sign in the
[44:08] hand and then the second pull which is
[44:10] Discerning of the hearts but then the
[44:11] third pull would be a complete secret no
[44:15] one would know what what he was doing he
[44:18] would not be able to to tell and so the
[44:21] angel of the Lord is preparing brother
[44:24] brandham for for what is coming ahead
[44:27] amen so keep that in mind as as you're
[44:29] going amen it says so take the example
[44:32] we see in Moses this Mighty uh uh anoint
[44:36] and and and then let me just say this
[44:38] real quick they had started the
[44:40] attitudes of these guys had already
[44:43] started looking at brother brandham
[44:44] saying you know uh we can do what you do
[44:48] and it and it had already just gotten to
[44:50] where it was it was just a quagmire and
[44:53] and the people were were well if you
[44:57] read the history books they said brother
[44:59] brandham had the greatest gift of them
[45:01] all but brother Branham was not
[45:03] intelligent he wasn't smart enough to to
[45:06] do the big meetings or Roberts had had
[45:09] already built this great big Network and
[45:13] he had followers and big buildings and
[45:15] and brother Brandon was still in a he
[45:17] still had a little trailer with with a
[45:20] typerwriter in it and and and he just
[45:23] looked like he was gone he just looked
[45:25] like he was finished up uh we had all of
[45:28] these guys had had these big old
[45:30] kingdoms old Roberts was was was uh
[45:33] already building his his his kingdom
[45:36] over here in in Tulsa you understand so
[45:39] so everyone's looking at brother brandom
[45:41] as if man you're washed up and you had
[45:43] the greatest gift of them all all right
[45:45] so he says take the example that we see
[45:47] in Moses this Mighty anointed Prophet
[45:50] Had A peculiar birth being born at the
[45:53] right time for the Deliverance of of
[45:55] Abraham's seed for me Egypt he never
[45:58] stayed in Egypt to argue scripture with
[46:00] them nor fuss at priest he went to the
[46:02] Wilderness until the people were ready
[46:04] to receive him God Called Moses to the
[46:07] Wilderness and the waiting was not on
[46:10] Moses part but because the people who
[46:13] were not ready to receive him Moses
[46:16] thought the people would understand that
[46:19] they but they did not then there is
[46:21] Elijah to whom the word of the Lord came
[46:24] and when he got through preaching the
[46:26] truth that group back there that was uh
[46:29] that is the Forerunner of the American
[46:31] Jezebel group would not receive the word
[46:35] god called him off the field plagued
[46:37] that generation for rejecting the
[46:38] prophet and the message that God had
[46:40] given him God called him to the
[46:42] Wilderness and he would he would not
[46:44] come out even for the king those who
[46:47] tried to persuade him to do so died but
[46:49] God spoke to his faithful Prophet by
[46:52] Vision out of hiding he came and brought
[46:55] back the word uh
[46:57] the word to Israel then come John the
[46:59] Baptist Christ faithful
[47:01] Forerunner the mighty Prophet for his
[47:04] day he did not go to his father's School
[47:06] nor the school of the Pharisees he went
[47:08] to no denomination but out of the
[47:11] Wilderness called there by God and there
[47:14] he stayed until God sent him with the
[47:16] message crying the Messiah is at hand
[47:19] Now take us let us take a scriptural
[47:21] warning here was it not in the days of
[47:24] Moses whom God had Vindicated
[47:27] that Kora rose up and withstood that
[47:30] Mighty prophet he disputed with Moses
[47:32] and claimed that he had as much from God
[47:35] to lead the people and that others
[47:38] shared in the divine revelation as well
[47:40] as did Moses he denied the authority of
[47:42] Moses now the people back there after
[47:45] they heard the truth the true word and
[47:48] were well acquainted with the fact that
[47:50] a true Prophet was Vindicated of God I
[47:53] say those people fell for Cor and his
[47:57] gang says Kora was not a scriptural
[48:00] Prophet but the people in great
[48:04] numbers um see great numbers with their
[48:08] leaders went for him and like the
[48:11] Evangelist today with their golden calf
[48:13] schemes like Kora they they look good to
[48:16] the people as Kora looked good then they
[48:19] have blood on their foreheads oil in
[48:21] their hands balls of fire on the
[48:23] platform they allow women preachers that
[48:26] women cut their hair wear slacks and
[48:28] shorts and bypass the word of God for
[48:31] their Creeds and dogmas that shows what
[48:34] kind of seed is in them but not all the
[48:37] people turned on Moses and left the word
[48:39] of God no the elect stayed with him the
[48:44] same is happening again today many are
[48:47] leaving the word but some are staying
[48:49] with it but remember the parable of the
[48:52] wheat and tears tears have to be bundled
[48:54] for burning and the these apostate
[48:57] churches are getting bound closer and
[48:59] closer together ready for the fire of
[49:02] God's judgment but the wheat is going to
[49:05] be garnered gathered to the master now I
[49:08] I want to say to you uh or I want you to
[49:11] be very careful here and see this God
[49:14] has promised that in the last at the end
[49:17] time Malachi 4 is going to be
[49:20] fulfilled it has to be for it is the
[49:23] spirit quickened word of God spoken by
[49:26] the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it
[49:29] it is just before Christ comes the
[49:31] second time by the time Jesus comes all
[49:35] scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile
[49:38] dispensation will be in its last Church
[49:40] age when that messenger of Malachi comes
[49:44] he will be right with the word he will
[49:46] take the whole Bible from Genesis to
[49:48] Revelation he will start at the serpen
[49:50] seed and carry on to the um on to the
[49:53] messenger in the latter day but he will
[49:57] be rejected by the
[49:58] denominations he has to be for that is
[50:02] history repeating itself from the time
[50:04] of Ahab Israel's history under Ahab is
[50:07] happening right here in America where
[50:09] the prophet of Malachi appears as Israel
[50:13] left Egypt to Worship in Freedom and
[50:16] pushed out the natives and raised up a
[50:18] nation with great leaders like David Etc
[50:21] then put on Ahab uh put an Ahab on the
[50:24] throne with a jezebel behind him to
[50:27] direct so have we done the same thing in
[50:30] America our forefathers left for this
[50:34] land to worship and live in Freedom they
[50:36] pushed back the natives and they took
[50:38] over the land the mighty men like
[50:41] Washington and Lincoln were raised up
[50:43] but after A While others other men of
[50:47] such poor caliber
[50:49] succeeded these worthy men that soon and
[50:53] Ahab was set in the presidential chair
[50:55] with a jezebel uh behind him to direct
[50:57] him it is a as such a time as this that
[51:01] the messenger of Malachi must come then
[51:05] the latter reign will come uh with then
[51:09] in the latter reign will come a mount
[51:10] Showdown a Mount Carmel Showdown watch
[51:13] this carefully and now to see it in the
[51:17] word John was the Forerunner of Malachi
[51:21] 4 he planted the former Reign and was
[51:24] rejected by the organizations of his Day
[51:27] Jesus came and had a mount
[51:30] Transfiguration Showdown the second
[51:32] Forerunner of Christ will seow for the
[51:36] latter Reign Jesus will be the the uh
[51:40] the will be the showdown between the
[51:42] denominations and the Creeds for he will
[51:45] come back uh he will come to back up his
[51:48] word and take his bride in the Rapture
[51:51] the first Showdown was Mount Carmel
[51:53] second Showdown uh was Mount
[51:56] Transfiguration and the third will be
[51:58] Mount Zion the strange behavior of Moses
[52:02] Elijah and John withdrawing from the
[52:05] people into seclusion left many confused
[52:09] they did not realize that it was because
[52:11] their messages had been rejected but the
[52:14] seed had been sown the planting is over
[52:18] judgment was next they had served their
[52:21] purpose as a sign to the people so
[52:24] judgment was next I believe Accord
[52:26] according to Revelations 13-6 that the
[52:29] bride will have to stop preaching for
[52:31] the best for the Beast is demanding the
[52:34] mark in the hand and the forehead if
[52:37] permission uh if permission to preach be
[52:40] granted denominations will take the mark
[52:43] and be forced to quit preaching then the
[52:46] lamb will come for his bride and the
[52:50] judge and judge the great
[52:52] Harlot now remember that Moses was born
[52:55] for a certain work he could not do that
[52:58] work until he had received the gifts
[53:01] which would enable him to do the work he
[53:03] had to go into the desert and wait there
[53:06] God had appointed had an appointed time
[53:09] there was uh to be a certain Pharaoh on
[53:12] the throne and the people had to be
[53:14] crying for the bread of life before God
[53:17] could send him back and this is true for
[53:20] our day but what do we have in this our
[53:22] day multitudes of working signs until we
[53:25] have a generation of sign Seekers that
[53:28] know little or nothing about the word or
[53:31] a true move of the spirit of God if they
[53:34] see blood oil and fire they are happy it
[53:38] matters not what is in the word they
[53:41] will support any sign even unscriptural
[53:43] ones but God has warned us about that he
[53:46] said in Matthew 24 that in the last days
[53:50] the two Spirits would be so close
[53:52] together that only the very elect could
[53:54] tell them apart for they alone would not
[53:57] be deceived how can you tell the spirits
[54:00] apart just give them the word test if
[54:03] they don't speak that word they are of
[54:06] that evil one and the as the evil one
[54:09] was the evil one deceived the first two
[54:12] Brides he will try to deceive the Bride
[54:15] of these last day by trying to get her
[54:17] to hybridize herself through Creeds or
[54:20] just plainly turning from the word to
[54:22] any signs that sooths her but God has
[54:24] never placed signs head of the word
[54:28] signs follow the word as when Elijah
[54:31] told the woman to bake a cake for him
[54:33] first according to the word of the Lord
[54:36] and when she did as the word said the
[54:39] proper sign came come to the word first
[54:43] then watch the miracle the seed word is
[54:46] energized
[54:48] by is is energized by the spirit How can
[54:52] any messenger sent from God believe only
[54:55] a part of the word and then deny some of
[54:58] it the true prophet of God in this last
[55:01] day will proclaim the whole word
[55:03] denominations will hate him his words
[55:06] may be as harsh as John the Baptist who
[55:08] called them vipers but the predestinated
[55:11] will hear it and be ready for the
[55:13] Rapture the Royal Seed of Abraham which
[55:17] like uh with like Faith as Abraham will
[55:20] hold to the to the word with him for
[55:23] they are predestinated together the last
[55:26] day Messenger will appear in God's
[55:28] appointed time it is the end time now as
[55:32] we all know for Israel is in her
[55:35] Homeland and any time now he will come
[55:39] according to Malachi when we see him he
[55:42] will be dedicated to the word he will be
[55:45] indicated pointed out in the word
[55:47] Revelations 10:7 and God will vindicate
[55:51] his ministry he will preach the truth as
[55:54] Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion
[55:57] Showdown many will misunderstand him
[56:01] because they have been taught scripture
[56:03] in a certain way which they consider
[56:06] truth and when he comes against that
[56:09] they will not believe even some true
[56:11] ministers will misunderstand the
[56:14] messenger because so much has been
[56:16] called God's truth by
[56:19] deceivers but this Prophet will come and
[56:22] as the Forerunner to the first uh coming
[56:25] cried behold beh the Lamb of God that
[56:27] taketh away the sin of the world even so
[56:30] will he no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb
[56:33] of God coming in glory he will do this
[56:36] for as John was the messenger of Truth
[56:39] to the elect so is this last Messenger
[56:43] to the elect and the word born
[56:47] Bride Can you say Amen so now this was
[56:51] this was given to to to brother brandham
[56:53] to
[56:54] speak um
[56:57] or to to write down and so there there
[56:59] was a lot uh in this in this so we had
[57:03] the Mount Carmel then we had the mount
[57:06] Transfiguration and then we had the
[57:07] Mount Zion amen the Rapture of the
[57:11] church now how does that rapture start
[57:14] the Rapture was in a three-phase in in
[57:17] in three three stages amen the Rapture
[57:20] is it comes with a shout with a voice
[57:25] and then the Trump of God
[57:26] and so the final thing will be the Trump
[57:29] of God that's when we are caught away
[57:32] amen and and we'll we'll meet the Lord
[57:34] in the air but right now amen he is
[57:38] sending that Prophet Messenger to come
[57:42] and pull us together gather us in Christ
[57:46] the word amen we're to meet in Christ
[57:49] the word and and so you you say well
[57:53] where where is that Mount Zion is that
[57:55] is that something that is is coming well
[57:57] the Apostle Paul there in the book of
[57:59] Hebrews and we can just turn there real
[58:02] quickly
[58:05] amen there's going to be a Mount Zion
[58:09] Showdown and and that is in U let's see
[58:12] Hebrews the 12th
[58:17] chapter
[58:22] amen and um uh
[58:26] we will we will look there at
[58:31] um uh let's just let's just start let's
[58:34] just start there at the 18th verse now
[58:38] um and he says for we are not come unto
[58:40] the mount that might be touched that
[58:43] burned with fire um nor unto Blackness
[58:46] and darkness and Tempest and he's now
[58:48] this here he's talking about amen when
[58:51] God appeared unto Moses and he says now
[58:54] the sound of a trumpet and the word and
[58:56] the voice of Words which voice they that
[59:00] heard intreated that word should not be
[59:02] spoken to them anymore other words they
[59:04] said hey this is this let not God talk
[59:07] to us anymore it it it it makes us
[59:10] scared so then God came and said I will
[59:13] not talk to you lip to ear like I once
[59:17] done but I will send you a prophet to
[59:20] prepare you when I'm going to speak I
[59:23] will send you a prophet now that's what
[59:25] he told him
[59:26] and that's that's been God's voice ever
[59:28] since even even with us having the
[59:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost God still
[59:32] sends a prophet to us that give us the
[59:36] word of the day amen and he always sends
[59:39] a prophet at the junction of time this
[59:42] is an incredible Junction of time
[59:44] because this is the going home of the
[59:46] Bride so so now he's telling me now this
[59:49] is not as coming to that mountain
[59:51] anymore Amen in 20th verse for they
[59:54] could not endure that that which was
[59:56] commanded and if so much of a beast
[59:58] touched that mountain it was stoned or
[1:00:01] thrust through with a dart so terrible
[1:00:03] was the sight that Moses said I
[1:00:05] exceedingly Quake fear and Quake but ye
[1:00:08] are come unto Mount Zion unto the city
[1:00:13] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[1:00:16] and to an innumerable company of angels
[1:00:19] to the general assembly and the Church
[1:00:22] of the firstborn which are written in
[1:00:24] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[1:00:26] to the spirits of just man made perfect
[1:00:30] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[1:00:31] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:00:34] that speaketh better things uh than that
[1:00:37] of Abel see that you refuse him not for
[1:00:40] if they escaped not who refused him that
[1:00:43] spoke on Earth how much
[1:00:46] more much more shall not we escape if we
[1:00:50] turn away from him that speaketh from
[1:00:52] Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth
[1:00:56] Earth and now he hath promised saying
[1:00:58] yet once more I uh Shake not the Earth
[1:01:02] only but also heaven and this word yet
[1:01:05] once more signifieth the removing of
[1:01:08] things that are shaking as of things
[1:01:10] that are made that things which cannot
[1:01:12] be shaken May remain wherefore we
[1:01:15] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:01:17] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[1:01:20] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:01:23] godly fear for our God is it consuming
[1:01:26] fire so so when so we are we understand
[1:01:31] that that the mount uh Zion Showdown is
[1:01:35] is Right Upon Us The Showdown has come
[1:01:38] in the spirit world and that and the
[1:01:39] fact that God came amen the the Rapture
[1:01:43] was in threefold it's three-fold so the
[1:01:46] word had to come back to earth headship
[1:01:50] had to come back to earth to prepare a
[1:01:54] bride this this woman amen is going to
[1:01:58] be bone of his bone word of his word
[1:02:00] faith of his faith she's going to
[1:02:02] believe that word and the power of the
[1:02:05] almighty God is going to be with her
[1:02:07] fulfilling his word in her amen and that
[1:02:11] when that when that Capstone comes upon
[1:02:14] this bride amen and making it that and
[1:02:18] making it a body there is nothing amen
[1:02:22] that is going to take that that could
[1:02:24] ever take the place of of what God is
[1:02:26] doing so so the the mount sun or or the
[1:02:29] the the Mount Zion Showdown is truly
[1:02:31] coming the headship has returned amen
[1:02:36] and he's going to call us home when he
[1:02:38] shall speak we shall answer now anybody
[1:02:42] anybody have any
[1:02:44] questions praise the Lord amen there was
[1:02:47] a lot of good reading there really a
[1:02:50] whole lot of good reading amen everyone
[1:02:54] understand
[1:02:57] amen hallelujah all right so um let's
[1:03:01] see what time is it it is
[1:03:04] 8:00 amen how many wants to read a
[1:03:07] little bit
[1:03:08] more let's let's go ahead and um let
[1:03:11] let's read another um let let's get to
[1:03:18] um let's read four more pages
[1:03:24] here all right um Christ eulogizes the
[1:03:29] church Revelations 2 and13 I Know Thy
[1:03:33] Works where thou dwellest even where
[1:03:36] Satan's seed is thou holdest fast my
[1:03:39] name and has not denied my faith even in
[1:03:43] those days wherein Antipas was my
[1:03:46] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[1:03:48] where Satan's where Satan dwelleth I
[1:03:51] Know Thy works these are identical words
[1:03:54] uttered to each of the seven Messengers
[1:03:58] relative to the people of God in each
[1:04:00] age as they are spoken of the two Vines
[1:04:04] true and false they will bring joy and
[1:04:07] gladness to the hearts of one group but
[1:04:10] they of to strike Terror in the hearts
[1:04:12] of the other for though we are saved by
[1:04:15] grace apart from Works uh true salvation
[1:04:19] brings forth works or deeds that will
[1:04:23] please God 1 John 3:7 little children
[1:04:27] let no man deceive you he that doeth or
[1:04:31] worketh righteousness is righteous even
[1:04:34] as he is
[1:04:36] righteous in this verse uh if this verse
[1:04:40] means anything at all it means that what
[1:04:43] a man does he is amen and I think that's
[1:04:47] good for us all to remember and you
[1:04:48] young people remember that you should
[1:04:51] underline that it means what a man does
[1:04:55] he is so so if
[1:04:58] you you you you can identify you can
[1:05:02] identify what is in Your Heart by what
[1:05:06] you do amen if you're sneaking around
[1:05:09] doing things that are wrong well then
[1:05:11] don't don't claim to have the baptism of
[1:05:13] the Holy Ghost because the life of God
[1:05:16] that is on the inside and and as brother
[1:05:19] bradam says all right it's going to
[1:05:21] bring joy to one but it should bring
[1:05:25] Terror to the other and fear to the
[1:05:28] other that is amen that is not right
[1:05:31] with God so so if we've got the word of
[1:05:34] God we're hearing the word of God don't
[1:05:36] amand the word of God and then have
[1:05:39] works that are contrary to the word of
[1:05:42] God Amen your your Works declares what's
[1:05:46] on the inside of you amen what you allow
[1:05:50] what you think what is there amen now I
[1:05:53] I'm not I'm not saying that temp
[1:05:55] temption isn't isn't isn't always
[1:05:58] present Temptation and persecution is
[1:06:00] always going to be there but but but the
[1:06:03] life of God or the works of God on the
[1:06:06] inside of you will declare listen I am
[1:06:09] not going to to to feed that devil I am
[1:06:13] not going to allow Leo to see a devil to
[1:06:15] take me down I am being cut off this
[1:06:19] Rapture is cutting everything Earthly
[1:06:22] and sinful off of me so that I can be
[1:06:25] prepared for a Rapture yes amen because
[1:06:29] we are truly going to make a Rapture now
[1:06:33] and so the uh what what a man does is
[1:06:36] what a man is amen what we allow what we
[1:06:40] allow want you to understand that what
[1:06:42] we allow says a lot about our
[1:06:46] character amen so you you young men uh
[1:06:50] you you all keep that in in your heart
[1:06:53] as as you're walking I think that's a
[1:06:55] good that I think that's a good um
[1:06:58] thermometer to be able to see you can't
[1:07:00] see your soul and everyone everyone in
[1:07:03] in they love that God sees the heart
[1:07:06] that's what everyone says God sees the
[1:07:09] heart God knows my heart yeah amen and
[1:07:12] so do I you know you're a jezebel you're
[1:07:15] you're you're you're you're condoning
[1:07:17] sin you're allowing things amen your
[1:07:20] phone shows what what you what what you
[1:07:22] are at your heart your uh your friend
[1:07:25] show what you are in your heart right so
[1:07:28] so what we want to do is not be
[1:07:30] hypocritical about this it's just
[1:07:32] downright stupid God knows my heart amen
[1:07:35] that's what the whole world is saying
[1:07:36] God knows my heart yes he does and
[1:07:38] you're going to burn with the wicked if
[1:07:40] you don't line that heart up with the
[1:07:42] word of
[1:07:43] God
[1:07:45] hallelujah so so we want to line this
[1:07:49] life our hearts up and say God don't let
[1:07:53] me just sit in church and and live here
[1:07:56] hypocritically your holy spirit is in
[1:07:58] here in our church your Holy Spirit
[1:08:00] you've promised this age is full of life
[1:08:02] you have you have sent Angels you've
[1:08:05] sent those angels to be my head you've
[1:08:09] sent there's an anointing on the earth
[1:08:12] to cause your word to live live in me
[1:08:17] can you say Amen y'all understand amen
[1:08:22] so so it's as a man does he is James
[1:08:26] 3:11 does does the fountain send forth
[1:08:29] at the same place Sweet Water and bitter
[1:08:32] Romans 6:2 how shall we that are dead to
[1:08:35] sin live any longer therein Matthew
[1:08:38] 12:33 to35 either make the tree good and
[1:08:42] his fruit good or else make the tree
[1:08:45] corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the
[1:08:48] tree is known by his fruit oh Generation
[1:08:52] of Vipers how can ye being evil speak
[1:08:55] good things for out of the abundance of
[1:08:57] the heart the mouth speaks and a good
[1:09:00] man out of the good Treasure of the
[1:09:02] heart bringeth forth good things and an
[1:09:05] evil man out of the evil treasure
[1:09:07] bringeth forth evil things now if a man
[1:09:10] is born of the word being born again not
[1:09:13] of the corruptible seed but of
[1:09:14] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:09:17] liveth and abideth forever 1 Peter 1 and
[1:09:19] 23 he will produce the word the fruit or
[1:09:24] works of his life will be a product of
[1:09:28] the kind of seed or life that is in him
[1:09:31] his Works therefore will be scriptural
[1:09:35] oh what an indictment this truth is
[1:09:37] going to be against the pergam Manan age
[1:09:40] there stands the matchless one in his
[1:09:43] hand the sharp sword with two edges the
[1:09:46] word of God that word will judge us in
[1:09:49] in the last day in fact the word is
[1:09:52] judging even now for it is the discerner
[1:09:56] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:09:58] heart it cuts aund the carnal from the
[1:10:02] spiritual it makes us living Epistles
[1:10:06] read and known of all men to the glory
[1:10:08] of God I Know Thy works if a man fears
[1:10:12] that he might not please the Lord then
[1:10:14] let him fulfill the word let's read that
[1:10:17] again if a man fears that he might not
[1:10:20] please God let him fulfill the word if a
[1:10:25] man wonders if if he will hear those
[1:10:28] words well done good and faithful
[1:10:30] servant let him fulfill the word of God
[1:10:33] in his life and assuredly he will hear
[1:10:36] those words of praise the word of Truth
[1:10:39] was the Christ here and then and it is
[1:10:41] the Criterion now there isn't another
[1:10:44] standard there isn't another Plum line
[1:10:47] as the world is going to be judged by
[1:10:50] one Christ Jesus even so it is going to
[1:10:54] be judged by the word word if a man
[1:10:56] wants to know how he is making out let
[1:10:59] him do as James suggests look into the
[1:11:02] mirror of God's word I Know Thy works as
[1:11:06] he stood there with the word examining
[1:11:08] their lives in the light of the
[1:11:11] blueprint he had laid out for them he
[1:11:14] must have been pleased in in a goodly
[1:11:16] measure for they like the others who had
[1:11:19] gone on before were enduring the
[1:11:21] persecution of the unjust and still
[1:11:24] joyfully clinging unto the Lord cleaving
[1:11:26] to the Lord difficult though it was at
[1:11:29] time to serve the Lord yet they served
[1:11:32] him and worshiped him in spirit and in
[1:11:35] truth with the false Vine it was not so
[1:11:39] at last they had repudiated the life
[1:11:43] that is built upon the word and were now
[1:11:45] going further and further away from the
[1:11:47] truth their actions bore witness to the
[1:11:50] depth to which they had sunk it says thy
[1:11:54] thou holds fast my my name to whom can
[1:11:57] we go thou alone Hast the words of
[1:12:00] eternal life they held fast then they
[1:12:03] were holding fast now but now but not
[1:12:07] with the Fantastic dread as men who
[1:12:09] lived out Barren lives they were holding
[1:12:12] fast in his strength in the Assurance of
[1:12:15] the spirit that they were one in him
[1:12:18] theirs was the sure knowledge of of the
[1:12:21] sins forgiven and they bore the name of
[1:12:24] Christian in testimony to it they knew
[1:12:27] and loved that name that was above every
[1:12:29] name their knees had bowed to that name
[1:12:32] their tongues had confessed to it
[1:12:34] whatever they said they did it all in
[1:12:36] the name of the Lord Jesus they had
[1:12:39] named that name and departed from Evil
[1:12:42] having taken their stand they were now
[1:12:45] prepared to die for that name and being
[1:12:48] assured of a better
[1:12:50] resurrection and then he goes to the
[1:12:52] song Take the name of Jesus with you
[1:12:54] child of sorrow and woe it will joy and
[1:12:57] comfort give you take it then wherever
[1:13:00] you go precious name oh how sweet hope
[1:13:04] of Earth and Joy Of Heaven already in
[1:13:06] the 2 century were those words Father
[1:13:09] Son and Holy
[1:13:11] Ghost um had spelled out Trinity to many
[1:13:15] and the uh poly
[1:13:19] eclesiastica
[1:13:21] polythetic idea of three Gods had become
[1:13:24] a Doctrine in the false Church it would
[1:13:28] not be long until that until the name
[1:13:30] was taken away and indeed it was in the
[1:13:33] age and then in it stad the titles of
[1:13:36] the one great God was would be
[1:13:39] substituted for the name Lord Jesus
[1:13:43] Christ uh while while the
[1:13:46] many apostasis and embraced a trinity
[1:13:50] and baptized using the titles of the
[1:13:52] godhead the little flock still B
[1:13:55] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:13:57] so held to the
[1:13:59] truth with so many dishonoring God and
[1:14:02] turning him into three gods and changing
[1:14:04] his gracious name into titles one would
[1:14:07] wonder if the signs and wonders that
[1:14:09] attend that such a great name would
[1:14:12] still be visited among the people indeed
[1:14:15] those signs were mightily and
[1:14:17] wonderfully manifested though certainly
[1:14:19] not in the first Vine or the false Vine
[1:14:22] men like Martin were greatly used in God
[1:14:25] bore them witness both by signs and
[1:14:28] wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that
[1:14:31] name was still effectual as it will
[1:14:34] always or as it always has been and ever
[1:14:37] will be where the Saints honor him
[1:14:40] through the word and through faith amen
[1:14:44] let's go let's let's read down let's
[1:14:46] let's go down um um to the next page and
[1:14:50] then we'll we'll end now it says thou
[1:14:53] has not denied my faith now I love this
[1:14:56] this portion here um this is I I I just
[1:15:01] I love
[1:15:02] this in Acts 3:16 when Peter had showed
[1:15:06] how the mighty Miracle had taken place
[1:15:09] upon the crippled one at the gate
[1:15:11] beautiful he explained it on this wise
[1:15:14] and his Jesus name through faith in his
[1:15:18] Jesus name hath made this man the former
[1:15:21] crippled strong yay the faith which is
[1:15:25] by or from him Jesus hath given him the
[1:15:29] man this perfect soundness in the
[1:15:32] presence of you all see there it is
[1:15:35] Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought about
[1:15:38] the
[1:15:39] miracle Peter did not claim it was his
[1:15:42] own human Faith anymore than he claimed
[1:15:45] that it was his own name he said the
[1:15:48] name of
[1:15:50] Jesus used in the faith which which is
[1:15:53] from Jesus performed that great work
[1:15:58] this faith is what the Lord was speaking
[1:16:01] about in Revelations 2 and 13 it was his
[1:16:05] faith it was not faith in him but it was
[1:16:10] his own faith that he had given to the
[1:16:13] Believers is that beautiful he don't
[1:16:15] want now Christianity is not me having
[1:16:19] enough faith and getting enough Faith to
[1:16:22] believe in the Lord no the new birth
[1:16:25] brother Randon would say in in in other
[1:16:27] places he uh in there in um um I believe
[1:16:31] it was um that that day at Calvary he
[1:16:34] says the new the the the new birth is
[1:16:37] the act of faith that God done in you so
[1:16:41] you have been given the faith of God he
[1:16:45] places his faith in you by the new birth
[1:16:48] amen so God's not telling you to to
[1:16:52] believe with your human Faith believe in
[1:16:55] him he's doing the work through you he
[1:16:58] gives you his faith the same faith that
[1:17:02] raised up Lazarus the same faith that
[1:17:06] that healed blind bmus the same Faith
[1:17:09] the only thing is he says I do nothing
[1:17:12] except the father for show me he was
[1:17:16] sensitive and there is where where's
[1:17:19] where this hard generation is is lacking
[1:17:23] is the sensitivity because we got too
[1:17:25] many other things that can catch our
[1:17:27] attention but if we could get our eyes
[1:17:30] and we must get our eyes on Calvary in
[1:17:32] such a way that we sharpen our
[1:17:34] sensitivity because the bride will do
[1:17:36] nothing except they have thus saith the
[1:17:39] Lord
[1:17:41] amen oh to think that the works of God's
[1:17:44] going to be do it must be done through
[1:17:46] you and he doesn't require you to do it
[1:17:48] by your own faith he says I'm going to
[1:17:50] give you my faith amen amen it says so
[1:17:54] so uh he says this faith is what the
[1:17:57] Lord was speaking of in Revelations 2:13
[1:17:59] it was his faith it was not faith in him
[1:18:03] but it was his own faith that he had
[1:18:05] given to the Believers Romans 12:3
[1:18:07] according as God ha dealt to every man
[1:18:11] according to verse one the men are
[1:18:13] Brethren the measures of Faith e
[1:18:15] Ephesians 2 and8 by grace are ye saved
[1:18:19] through faith and that faith not of
[1:18:22] yourselves it is the gift of God it is
[1:18:26] all it also says James 2:1 my brethren
[1:18:29] notice he too is talking to Brethren
[1:18:32] have not the faith of not in have not
[1:18:37] the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:18:41] respect of persons in this pergam manian
[1:18:43] age where men were
[1:18:46] humanizing uh the Salvation having
[1:18:49] turned from truth that salvation is from
[1:18:51] the Lord having cast aside the doctrine
[1:18:54] of election and and open wide the the
[1:18:57] church door their Fellowship to any and
[1:19:00] all who subscribe to their tenants never
[1:19:03] mind the word uh uh in in this age of
[1:19:06] Rapid degradation they were still the
[1:19:10] few who had the measure of that Faith of
[1:19:13] Our Lord Jesus Christ and not only used
[1:19:16] that faith and acts of power but
[1:19:19] withstood those who dared to say that
[1:19:22] they were Sav simply on the grounds of
[1:19:24] joining a church Church they knew that
[1:19:26] no man could truly believe unto eternal
[1:19:29] life and the righteousness of God apart
[1:19:32] from The Measure of Faith of the Lord
[1:19:34] Jesus himself and today's church is
[1:19:38] filled with mental believers who endorse
[1:19:41] the Virgin birth the shed blood going to
[1:19:44] church taking communion and are not
[1:19:47] reborn at all even so in that third age
[1:19:51] was the same problem human Faith wasn't
[1:19:54] enough then and it is not enough now it
[1:19:58] takes the very faith of the Son of God
[1:20:01] to drop into a man's heart so that he
[1:20:04] can receive the Lord Of Glory into the
[1:20:07] temple not made with hands this was a
[1:20:11] living faith I live by the faith of the
[1:20:14] Son of God Paul did not say that he
[1:20:16] lived by faith in the Son of God it was
[1:20:19] the faith of the Son of God that had
[1:20:22] given him life and kept him living in
[1:20:25] Christian Victory no they had not denied
[1:20:28] that salvation was Supernatural from the
[1:20:30] start to finish they kept alive the
[1:20:33] truth of his name of his faith and they
[1:20:37] were blessed by the Lord and counted
[1:20:39] worthy of him isn't that
[1:20:42] beautiful I love that amen I love that
[1:20:46] so so we we want to uh thank the Lord so
[1:20:49] it's not it's not a mental Faith amen
[1:20:52] it's not a believing unto
[1:20:55] amen and it's not believing but it there
[1:20:58] is truly a faith you're believing with
[1:21:02] the very faith that Jesus Christ had in
[1:21:06] himself what what what was the very
[1:21:08] first law of God God spoke and he
[1:21:12] believed his own word hallelujah
[1:21:15] hallelujah and the bride amen should
[1:21:18] believe this word in such a way that
[1:21:21] when we speak what he has spoke for this
[1:21:24] generation we can have all faith knowing
[1:21:27] that it shall come to pass amen now now
[1:21:33] there's always going to be the
[1:21:35] enemy that tries to uh persuade you live
[1:21:39] in a you you live in a in a human body
[1:21:42] but I'm here to tell you the Rapture is
[1:21:44] only going to come to those who have who
[1:21:47] who have totally amen ignored every
[1:21:51] devil everything that your mind tells
[1:21:53] you every every situation you you're
[1:21:56] going to have to walk in the
[1:21:58] Supernatural realm of God and believe
[1:22:01] the supernatural word of God and it's
[1:22:03] producing a body change within you can
[1:22:06] you say Amen now are you battling amen

[1:22:37] because the enemy is here to stop this
[1:22:39] Rapture the enemy is here just like come
[1:22:42] on brother Brandon was just talking
[1:22:44] about he said that that the false Vine
[1:22:47] had so persecuted those that small
[1:22:49] minority of Believers that small
[1:22:51] minority they were being beat Every
[1:22:53] Which Dr ction it looked but the faith
[1:22:57] of Jesus Christ was in them and they
[1:23:01] would not allow that false Vine and what
[1:23:04] Satan was doing to them to get them to
[1:23:06] shut up and to quit believing the word
[1:23:07] of the Lord so if there if they had a
[1:23:10] physical persecution and they and the
[1:23:12] enemy was trying to shut them up then
[1:23:14] how much more is the enemy going to shut
[1:23:16] up this rapturing generation amen and
[1:23:20] and he'll come up with every way he can
