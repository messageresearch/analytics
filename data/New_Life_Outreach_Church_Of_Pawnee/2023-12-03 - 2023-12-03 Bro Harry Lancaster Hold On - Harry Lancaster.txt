Lord and we just commit the remainder of the service service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may all have your seats as is so often with my sermons it may take a little while for everyone to see the connection from the first verse as we start with but we're going to kind of build up and we'll see where where it goes but you know when we look back at at Israel in in the Old Testament Israel during the time of King Saul and and and King David was a land of almost constant turmoil it was surrounded by enemies and they were under constant threat um even after they would defeat the opposing Army it wouldn't be long until that same enemy was coming back to fight them again there was there was no lasting peace there was no lasting rest for them whether they were beating the amorites or the ammonites or the Philistines or take your pick of which one even if they won they were just waiting until the next time the enemy came back in 1st Samuel chapter 22 and verse two it says and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men now this was speaking about David while he was on the run from King Saul and it was during this time that his forces began to grow individuals that had been cast out of society for some reason gathered themselves to him um whether these were debtors or criminals or foreigners they sought him out to become part of his band and during this time his men began to become accomplished Warriors they weren't necessarily Warriors when they came some of them may have been some of them could have been mercenaries scriptures don't go into enough details for us to know that for sure one way or another but obviously if a lot of these men were debtors or different things these were not trained Warriors all of them they were simply seeing something in David that they wanted to to go after seeing something in David that they wanted to follow 1st Samuel chapter 17 in verse 1 now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shoka which belongs to Judah and pitched between shoka and azaka in ephes Damon and then Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of ela and set the battle in Array against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on a mountain one on the one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span dropping down to verse 45 then said David to the Philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the army of Israel whom thou Hast defied this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hands and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands David inspired the men that came to him because of what he had done and even with what he had done even in his speech to Goliath as he's talking he's not saying oh because of me and my power we're going to overcome on he says it's not by sword it's not by Shield it's not by my strength of arms because the battle is the Lord's and so even though I'm facing this giant that is so much larger me than I can't take on I don't have to fear because the battle's the Lords I'm trusting in Him to be the one that does the fighting I'm trusting in Him to be the one that will take on the enemy yeah and then David has gone off and here all these men are coming to him that are I'm sure many of them were inspired because of what had happened with Goliath there were many that were inspired because of the other battles that David had gone into during his time fighting for King Saul but all these different things they were inspired in and there was something about David that they wanted to follow him and in following him they began to they began to manifest some of the same things that David had done because David was not the only one to kill a giant if we go into 2 Samuel chapter 21 ends verse 15 moreover the Philistines had yet War again with Israel and David went down and his servants with him and fought against the Philistines and David waxed faint and ish benob which was of the sons of the Giants the weight of whose spear weighed 300 shekels of brass and weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slain David but abashi the son of Zariah suckered him and smokee the Philistine and killed him then the men of David swear un him saying Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of Israel and it came pass after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob then cachi The Hite slew saf which was of the sons of the giant there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines where elhanan the son of JY orim a bethle slew the brother of Goliath the gitite the staff of whose spear was like a Weaver's beam and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes 4 and 20 in number he also was born to the Giant and when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of shimya the brother of David slew him these four were born to the Giant in Gaff and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants and so four more Men followed the model that they had seen in David they didn't overcome Giants because going into it going I'm this strong I'm this powerful but they followed the model that David had said going the battle is the Lord's now they were willing to go in and fight they didn't stand on the S sideline and go all right Lord hit him with the lightning bolt throw a giant meteor down and crush them do whatever they put themselves into the battlefield but they weren't going in thinking I'm such a mighty warrior I can take on this giant they weren't going in thinking that because I'm so powerful because I am such an amazing member of this fighting unit that I can take on the giant but they had had modeled before them the man who went the battle is the Lord's the battle is his to take on and so they went in so then these four other individuals could all stand up and say that like David they had slain one of the Giants that's right they had taken them down the same way that David had been able to take down Goliath these four men could now stand and go we've killed Giants as well we've slain this enemy that came in David's men had a reputation that was known throughout Israel during the time that that Absalon attempted to seize the throne the adviser hushai spoke to him about the Warriors in 2 Samuel chter 17 starting at verse 8 for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be Mighty Men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her welps in the field I don't go around bears and even I know you don't get between the mother bear and her young that's right this is is as common a knowledge as you can get and this is how he's describing David's men they are now at such a point that it's like you've taken away the Cubs from a mother bear these are not going to be easy men to be around these are not going to be easy men to face in this moment and thy father is a man of war and will not Lodge with the people behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a Slaughter among the people that follow Absalom and he also that is Valiant whose heart is as the Heart of a Lion shall utterly melt for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and that they which be with him are Valiant men he was making it clear that all of these Mighty Men had a reputation at this point they had been with David they had fought through things they had faced the enemy they had gone through all these different tests and they had come up from being men that weren't Warriors to now being respected as these are Valiant men these are warriors that can face the enemy these are warriors that you're not not sure that you want to face these are warriors that are being compared to some of the fiercest animals that are around and you're going do you really want to go up against these guys is this really the time to face them is this really the time to be up against them these Warriors had had come from being like I said basically the lowest in society the ones that have been Outcast the ones that had been set aside the ones that had been cast out for some reason and now they were some of the most respected men these were the men that stood by David through everything these were the men that stood by David while he was in the wilderness stood by David after he became king stood with him and killed Giants stood with him and faced battle after battle after battle how much more should we be striving to be in that type of place how much more should it be that when Satan tells one of his demons to come after you that they want to pause for a moment and go yeah yeah that that's Miguel do you know what happened to the last group that went after him do you know what he did in the last battle you remember the last time we sent somebody to brother Merl's house we never saw them again they never came back and now you're wanting me to go you know we've heard the people make the comment or in some ways almost make it as a joke comment that when we wake up hell should tremble because now we're back up we're back on the battlefield And yet when we look at the Old Testament that is exactly the model that was being set forth when you look at David's Mighty Warriors these were men that were feared that had come from being the lowest come from being the basest come from being the least respected to now being the men that people were in awe of that people would look at and wonder that people would look at and if you were the enemy would fear yeah these were not just common foot soldiers that were pawns being pushed around these were the elite that had proved themselves time and time again and had come from being someone that was inexperienced wielding a weapon to now being an expert with what they used this was now their tool of trade yeah this was the thing they were used to handling whether it was a sword whether it was a spear whether it was a club whether it was whatever weapon they may have been using they knew how to use it well yeah it was not a question about well what do I want to try to use today they knew which weapon they were going to grab when they went into battle they had the weapon that they were secure with they had the weapon that they understood that they had experience with I've got a little bit of a a lengthy quote here so just bear with me in why little Bethlehem in 1958 those Warriors that was with David stayed right by his side if a Philistine come up he had to fight whoever it was they were picked on every side poor David in his mind all confused he thought how can it be Lord you know leaders sometimes go through things that the congregation doesn't know they're going through when they think of promises God has made then why don't it come to pass they don't tell their congregation they don't tell the people they associate wish but there's many frustrations in the heart of a real leader David sitting there his his throat burning him it was in the middle of summer the Philistines was taking advantage of that split between David and Saul and Saul looking for David everywhere and the Philistines also and then the Philistines looking for the Israelites talk about a time of confusion just about like it is now David taking the Refuge in this little place in this little shelter everywhere he could get to the little strongholds that he could hold on to then he got up on the mountain on that hot middle of the summer when the heat was tremendous his throat parching frustrations and fears in his heart wondering oh God how could it be you poured that oil upon me not because I chose myself but you chose me why did you call me from hurting the Sheep out yonder and told me you give me this to serve your people and here you've got me between the fires everywhere that was going through his heart he sat on the hill and he looked down and there the Philistines has come in and garrisoned right in Bethlehem his little home then his little city was under government control of the enemy not only that but his own Father's House Jesse's house was under bondage to the Philistines there was his own Nation his own church against him here was the enemy he was fighting here is the church people he was fighting not because he wanted to but because he was forced to do it but David in his own mind was was flustrated I can imagine let's watch him a minute goes back out there and scks down looks down there and thinks my own beloved City Bethlehem look at it there there the great things of God has taken place where my father's father's father's father was born where my great great great great great grandmother Yonder uttered in her in the time of birth of Judah from whose tribe I'm from that the Yonder laid something Supernatural she uttered their place and there Joshua placed that son right in there and through there has come all these things in here it got to be I was a sheep here H her and you poured oil on my head you said I would be king I believe you then he goes and looks down there and thinks well Way Down Yonder in my little city where I was born that little group where I was with them good old days it would be better if the methodists looked back to their good old days when they're few and far between and little school houses out here in America falling under the power of God and throwing water in their face it would be better for you Baptists look back where you come from too and the rest of them you Pentecostals look back to where you come from that's right let me interject for just a minute might be better for us message people to look back where we come from occasionally sir In the Heat of the battle here David began to think oh I can remember them nights I laid out yonder on that Hillside I remember when I watched them Stars how they moved up yonder and how God talked to my little boy heart I can remember when I got sew in the spirit one day looking at the clouds and the Shady Green Pastures till I screamed out in the spirit and saying the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I remember one time little old lion come up one morning and got one of my sheep and the spirit of God Came Upon me and I went out and grabbed him and cut him to pieces I remember remember that Deliverance oh I can remember that evening just before the sun went down a bear came in and got him and I killed him them great Deliverance I remember when I sang his Praises in my childhood when I hted my sheep oh God take me back to that place take me back to my first love and sometimes we think that but we're in the heat of the battle something has got to be done we were boys once we're grown up men now the fight is on I remember when the sawdust boiled up on the floor and the people screamed and shouted and you couldn't get around the place nowhere here for people but it's not that way today the battle is on oh it's not William brandom the little boy preacher anymore you got to produce something yes sir there's got to be something different the time is on the battle is on the heat is on the time to be delivered the people Everyone is found written in the book now the time has come yes David and all his frustrations walking back and forth and thinking oh this hot day oh it's so hot oh I wish I had a drink then his mind goes back to way down there by the gates of Bethlehem there was a well there was no water like that water you know Palestine has some bad water they have evil Waters they even to Blackwater fever and stuff in them and a lot of its alkaline water which would kill you but Bethlehem is the water seep of the province there's no water like Bethlehem had David used to think when I take my sheep and start out the morning I'd go by that old well and drink oh oh how cool and how sweet and how it quenched The Thirst and now his throat is going yet anointed oh if I only had a drink of water now his Warriors and he screamed out in his despair oh if someone would bring me a drink again from that Old Well Yonder in Bethlehem oh after dreaming of his childhood days and the victories and see him in the place where he's sitting here between the fire as you scream oh somebody could bring me water from Bethlehem now his Warriors could not interpret his thinking but brother they loved him with all that was in them the least of his desire was a command to them three of his Mighty Warriors pulled their swords slipped off from camp and cut their way 25 miles David in there going no doubt wondered where are they at what have they done where did they go did they know they're jeopardizing their life they're right in the jaws of death through a 25 mile line laying in Ambush everywhere the swords of flickering and the shields of blasting but their man their brother that they believed that would be king desire to drink oh brother I wonder if the Warriors today are willing to cut their way through formalisms doubts and unbelief to refresh in the presence of the Lord his desires the least of your desires if it's Africa India if it's through the street whatever it is the least of your desires Lord is my command death doesn't mean a thing to me popularity my what am I what will I be means nothing Lord is to fulfill your desires that's the Warriors that's standing by the side of him if they call me Holy Roller if my name is scandalized if they kick me in the streets that doesn't matter your desire is my command amen that's the real Soldier yes sir the Mighty Man of David his desire was their command when they heard their leader longing for a drink from the well I don't think that they went and called the committee and Drew straws to see who would be the one to go I think these three men looked at each other grabbed their weapons and a couple buckets maybe one bucket I don't know how many they took at least one and then those soldiers set out because their one thought their one purpose was to fill David's desire that's right if he wanted to drink from Bethlehem then they were going to get him a drink from Bethlehem or they were going to die trying right we can look through the pages in the scriptures and we can see this list of these Mighty Warriors of David is there a list in heaven that has your name listed this the same way to go these were the Mighty Warriors in leoa these were the Mighty Warriors that were willing to fight through every bit of Darkness through every Temptation every battle that came along because it was their Lord's desire that this be accomplished it was their Lord's desire that this happened it was their Lord's desire that this person be testified to it was their Lord's desire that this person be reached that this person be prayed for that this this this and we can just see the list like you can read through the entire thing in Samuel or in Chronicles and there's brother James Torrance one of the I don't know what the numbers are in the Old Testament was 30 I think we're probably a little more than 30 but one of the however many brother Mike King one of the how many sister Tina Martin one of the how many and maybe there are some that we're just listed as part it doesn't really go into exploits and then maybe there are a few that just like in the Scriptures it goes they were part of the three they were part of the this many because they stood up in this situation they faced this enemy they battled this this giant what did they do they fought their way through until they got to that well they dipped the bucket of water out and here they come back fighting cutting their way from right to left until they come into the presence of David said here you are my Lord oh my what a man that was disgraced a man that was hated by the church a man that was hated by the king the man that that was hated by the Philistines a man that was hated everywhere nearly but a little group that followed him they knew he was the coming King today I know you we sing great songs we build great churches we have great anthems and everything we praise to him like that but Jesus said in your hearts you are far from me for you teach for Doctrine the Commandments of Men Let the Holy Spirit come in and do something in the church showing the presence of Jesus Christ they'll kick you out the door in vain do you worship me they worship but in vain do you do it teaching for Doctrine the traditions of men but there's Warriors who believe him there's Warriors who stand by it with the spiritual understanding like in Little Bethlehem Yonder see sure it was David picks up this bucket of water he looked at it and the Bible said he poured it upon the ground said Lord be it far from me that I would drink that the Warriors jeopardize their life to go Yonder to bring this water to me it's the blood of men I cannot do it and this this Sweet Water they jeopardized their lives for and broke through the enemy line to go Yonder and get David poured it upon the ground as a free will offering to the Lord 1 Chronicles chap 11 and verse 12 and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the aite who was one of the three mighties he was with David at pdim and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the Philistines and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and delivered it and slew the Philistines and the Lord saved them by great Deliverance I don't know if any of you noticed back in 1 Samuel chap CH 17 and verse 1 that we read it says the Philistines were pitched between Shoku and azaka in ephes damim now ephes damim means the edge of blood when we go back to 1 Chronicles 11 and verse 13 it says he was with David at pdim that is translated as the boundary of blood and it's understood by Scholars that even though two slightly different names are used there that it's the same place so this was a portion of land that the Philistines had come against before this was where David had fought against Goliath and now the Philistines had come back how many of you in your lives have a Battleground that the enemy seems to keep coming against and keep coming against because this is your border ground this is the weak spot in the defenses and they keep sending battle after battle after battle against that spot and your Battleground is not necessarily the same as your neighbor's Battleground right each one of us have the own battles in our lives but you'll quickly find that the enemy targets the same spots over and over because they can tell this is this is the weak area maybe we didn't win last time but we might break through this time maybe we didn't win last time or maybe we did win last time and then finally got driven away and so we're going to keep coming back to see if we can get back in there because we used to own it that used to be our territory that used to be our land and we keep fighting in the same territory the same place over and over but here you have Eleazar the son of Dodo the ahite and he was one of the three mighties he was the one that was num listed number two he was one of the most what was considered the most powerful of the Warriors and here he's gathered with David and it says that the people fled from before the Philistines and so it ends up being Eleazar and David that's it it's the two of them against the Philistine Army and they set themselves in the midst of the parcel and they delivered it and slew the Philistines and the Lord saved them by a great Deliverance let's go to 2 Samuel chap 23 and verse 9 and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the ahite one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away meaning they ran they didn't stick around the men of Israel fled he arose and smokee the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto The Sword and the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil now there's no way to be sure whether whether these two scriptures are talking about two separate events or whether it's giving just slightly different descriptions of the same event don't know for sure Scholars will argue that until we're gone we can ask the Lord on the other side which one it was doesn't particularly matter a whole lot whether it was one event or whether it was two different events it's impressive either way in the description that we see in 2 Samuel here when they defied the Phil defied the Philistines that were gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away so elaz Eleazar was not a man that was timid even when the rest of Israel fled he was still bold enough to defy the Philistines he wasn't standing there quietly waiting for them to come he was taunting he was yelling he was asking them to come closer all the kind of things that you picture in your head of he is defying them then when they come here Rises and he begins to Smite the Philistines now there a couple things that that I find interesting about this first off it see see very quickly that his weapon of choice is the sword now being a part of David's Army there is no doubt that Eleazar was experienced with the sword this was not his first time ever grabbing it he had been with David for a while he was part of this Elite group this was not his first time ever picking up a sword it was something that he understood it was something that he had handled before more than likely it was a weapon that he had personally cared for normally in military units it's common that you care for your own weapon this is what you're assigned it's given to you and whether this was a weapon that had been issued to him or whether was one that he had brought himself he was the one who spent the time cleaning it he was the one who spent the time sharpening it he was the one who spent the time honing it he was the one who spent the time caring for it to make sure that it was ready for battle making sure that it wasn't sitting up on the wall rusting that it wasn't pitted or chipped or any of these kind of things it was cared for to be used and to be ready in battle yeah it was a weapon that he had experience with before he ever went out to battle he had practiced with it probably countless hours whether it was the idea of Shadow Boxing against imaginary opponents whether it was training with his fellow soldiers or whether it was in previous smaller skirmishes and battles he had used this weapon time and time again so he knew the weight of it he knew the heft of it he knew the balance he knew how much force he needed to use to swing it he knew what it could cut through and what he should avoid hitting because it probably couldn't cut through that he had used this weapon over and over and over to the point where you could all some people would say that it was like the extension of his arm type thing because he knew it so well for you electricians I'm sure there are certain tools that you've used so many times you don't even have to think about when you grab it brother William doing carpentry and different work I'm sure there are certain tools that he grabs that he just immediately there's no like testing the heft or anything when he grabs it he grabs it and goes to work because he's used it so many times there's certain tools that that he's used that many times there's certain tools that have been used in the bet trade and that's what this sword was to Eleazar this was a weapon that he knew there was no question there was no well let me let me test it for a minute before the enemy gets here he had gone through all that he knew how to use the weapon now generally when a person is in battle and begins to get weary normally the chances are they're grip begins to slacken when they begin to get tired they begin to to loosen up just a little bit and they're more likely to have the weapon slip out of the hand or twist unexpectedly or do different things to where they're not going to be as effective but yet what we find is in this battle that's not what happened it says he got weary but his hand clayed unto the sword now you could go into trying to give some sort of natural explanation he gripped it so hard his hand cramped around it to where he couldn't let it go you can go into a supernatural explanation going God put it there and it wasn't moving there's not enough in the scripture for me to go which way it was all I know is it didn't move it was in his hand it didn't come out whether you want to say it was natural or Supernatural I don't care it stayed right so you may as well call it Supernatural no matter whether it was natural or not cuz it did the opposite of what would normally happened it held on to him because it was there he couldn't he couldn't let go of it if he wanted to it was there but as much as he knew his weapon and cared for his weapon as much as he had experience with his weapon the scriptures are also still very clear about who brought the Victory and the Lord brought a great victory that day the victory came from the Lord the Lord chose to use Eleazar in that situation but elazar didn't walk away going I am such an amazing Warrior he walked away going God used me God used me in this battle God used me to to take on this enemy God used me to overcome here in the moments when I was weary in the moments where I was so tired that I should have dropped The Sword and the moments where my grip should have weakened and it should have Twisted on me to where I was just hitting the flat of the blade against people or it should have been knocked from my hand when somebody else swung against it in all those moments it was still there and it kept swinging and I kept taking the enemy on I think we all can think of brothers and sisters that we either know currently or that have gone on that you would go they held the sword till the end they never let it go they never Let It Drop they held it on you know brother D and sister Jalene are two that I would hold up as they've held the sword they haven't dropped it they haven't let it go they've held it right up till the end of the battle I watched other brothers and sisters that y'all have never met that I knew from from Florida or that I knew from Alabama that were Elders that they held the sword until the very end their testimony was never shaken they were never down whether they were fighting some sort of physical ailment whether they were fighting whatever they had the sword the whole way through and they would have the testimony that at the end it became to the point where they were not even really holding the sword the sword was holding them the sword was clear leaving to them we know that in Hebrews it talks about that the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword when we talk about Eleazar he had the sword that he used all the time he had the sword that he was experienced with it wasn't anything that he had a doubt about it wasn't anything that he had questions about it wasn't something that when he grabed it he struggled to know how should I hold it or what stance should I use or how many of us can go hey I have no struggle to find the scripture I'm looking for I have no struggle to find this quote or this scripture when I need it when we have a situation that comes up in our lives how many of us can go yes I've used this weapon so well well I know how to find what I need to face this I know it because I've used it so long I've been in it so long like what brother William was preaching about this morning that we have to be in the word for ourselves Beyond just hearing what The Minister's preaching but can we sit there and when he says a scripture without referencing it completely when he says a quote without necessar telling us exactly where it's from can we just sit there and not and go yeah that's right I I remember reading that before I've been there or are we sitting there going is that really what it says was that was that was that is that really in there I don't remember seeing that before that's that's new I've never heard that are we simply taking it all completely on face value going there is no way this Minister would ever say anything wrong so I don't need to look in that myself they've got it all we're good now I am going to be the first one to tell you I don't know everything in here I am not at the point I've heard so many people and I've watched it when brother Duran would have the strength to be up here ministering and he just starts rattling off scriptures and quotes and you can tell when he's saying it that he's not going close he's going exactly what it is there's no well brother brandom said something like it's brother brandom said DT D D D D DT do there's no saying well the Bible says something like it's the scripture says D DT DT D DT DT DT I'm not in that place I am not at the place where I can be like brother Duran and just rattle It Off I am not at the point where I am the expert with my weapon which means I need to can spend more time with it I need to spend more time in training I need to spend more time practicing I need to be spend more time wielding it to the point where it is second nature to the point where it is when the enem is coming in I don't have to struggle and go quick grab my computer and do a search is there a quote somewhere about this is is there a scripture that deals with this in some way it's no I know it's there because I've read it before I don't have to scramble and wonder is this weapon going to work when we spend the time in the word and become impregnated like brother William was talking about we have the experience where with our weapon we know how to use it we know how to handle it we know how to wield it we have faith in it because it's something we're experienced in we're not standing there with our sword wondering will this cut through the enemy's armor will this hold up till the enemy's blows against it when the enem is throwing things at us and saying you know that's just from a missile blowing up right that's just that's just smoke from there when those kind of things get thrown against us we're not standing there wondering is it going to hold up we're able to stand there with the confidence to go no that's seven angels yes sir there's no ifs ANS or butts even if you were were to show me supposed video evidence that it's a missile it doesn't change what I believe because I'm not standing on what you supposedly can prove or the fact that there are no articles about this many people falling off a bridge and drowning that brother brandom saw when he was a kid who cares do I need evidence for every single piece or can I trust in the weapon that I've been given come on can I trust in the word that I've been given when I can read through the message and everything brother brandom taught can tie back into the scripture yes sir why do I care if there's evidence about whether guys fell off a bridge or not it doesn't matter it'd be it'd be completely different if we could take what brother brandom taught and go well this doesn't quite line up something doesn't match now we're in a whole different conversation that's right but that's not what they ever bring anytime they come to get you to question your weapon it's trying to question well there's no evidence that this Vision was actually true there's no evidence that this happened there's no evidence of this yeah but every one of his sermons lines up yeah everything he taught lines up everything he taught matches with the scriptures which that's the evidence we're supposed to be looking at that's what we're supposed to be examining yeah was the word true or not do I have faith in my weapon or not have I handled my weapon enough to where I have no doubt on what it can take I have no doubt how it can go go against the enemy I have no doubt how it can be wielded in battle when we begin to come towards the end of our Earthly Journeys if the Lord terries and all of us continue to go along are we going to be ones that other people can look at and go you know they're like Eleazar the sword clung to them the sword clung to their hand there was never a chance they dropped it there was never a chance it slipped they held on to it the whole way through and ultimately it held on to them are we one of the mighty men that the enemy doesn't want to face are we one of the mighty men that hey we can go out and we can slay Giants when necessary we can face armies when necessary we can face the worst battle that comes along we can face bad medical diagnosis we can face oppression depression mental battles physical trauma emotional trauma take your pick of what it was the enemy would throw at you but yet you're able to stand there and go my weapon is strong strong enough and I've used my weapon enough to know I can trust it this wasn't something that I just got out of boot camp it was handed to me yesterday and I've never swung at at anything before it looks pretty that's all I know or is this a weapon that you have sharpened you have honed you have oiled you have worked with over and over and over the Mighty Men weren't men that just came straight out of boot camp that had joined a little while ago these weren't men that had a lack of experience these were men that knew their weapon the men that would fight for David to go all the way to get that water were not men that had joined the army that morning and we're like yes great we can prove ourselves in this these were seasoned Warriors that knew David loved David and as soon as David said he wanted it that was now their job that's the point where all of us are supposed to be moving towards if we're not there already we're supposed to be at the point where if this is what our Lord wants done then we're doing it if this is what's supposed to happen then it's going to happen or I'm going to die trying yes this is the weapon I'm going to use to fight for it because I have faith in my weapon I have faith in the word I have trust in the word because it's been put to the test multiple times this isn't a brand new blade that's never seen combat this is something that has been through the trials and I've discovered that it holds up brother Merl you've been through a few trials has the word held up the whole way through brother Joey you faced a few things you've come out of a few things has the word held up the whole way through sister jene I know the word's held up for you every step of the way and each one of us is supposed to have that testimony brother Ken I know I've heard from you multiple times how the word is held up for you as you fa different situations as you fa different tests in life and God was still there to provide God was still there to protect God was still there to watch out for you each step of the way each of us are at different stages in our journey I still consider I still feel like I'm on the younger side of my journey I haven't gone that far yet I've still got a lot of testing to do with my weapon it feels like then I realize I'm a little farther along than I feel like but still not that far we've got some of these young men on the front young women on the front that their weapons are still pretty new they're still learning how to wield them they're still learning how to use them they're learning how much they can actually trust it but ultimately we're supposed to be at that point where we have complete faith in the word that God gave us am where there is no question there is no doubt we know that this is God's word and that's enough brother brandom says in the sermon how can I overcome he says Jesus told us how to do it he overcome overcome means to stand the test that's right like all the old Saints did like Jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the word said you destroy this temp Temple and I'll raise it up in 3 days the word said so see and in the presence of death he defeated it he overcame death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the Grave he overcame the grave why all by the word and humility oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example see he defeated everything overcome it Eleazar was a man who was fighting for his King he was a man who was fighting the enemy to defend his Nation he was a man that was willing to face whatever the enemy threw at him he was willing to stand up basically alone and defy the enemy he was willing to fight on by himself he was willing to fight on through the weariness through the tiredness through his body wanting to give out and in the end he was willing to confess as much as everyone and the Lord brought a great Victory the Mighty Men of David were not some modern day superhero that's trying to get a big name for themselves in a world now where everyone is fascinated by superheroes it's such a big thing but then when you actually go through history you find out it's not really that different they used to have all the stories in mythology that talked about they're part Gods part humans you had all these different things where they would go hey we can be more we can be something amazing and ultimately they were all simply aspiring to try to be what God Said that we are Christ said ye are Gods the word said you are Gods we're made in the likeness of God as the world stries and desires for that Superhero that's able to do all this we can look back in the scriptures and go those were the superheroes those were some of them and they weren't going hey look at me it's because of me they were going that's our King we fight for him that's our God he gives us the victory we're not trying trying to make a name for ourselves and when we look at it we're not trying to make a name for ourselves we're not going and trying to be this is all about Harry Lancaster to build my own platform so that I can be a traveling minister or get my own church somewhere or do this or do that who cares there's a reason that brother brandham would look at us and say I call you bride I call you Mrs Jesus Christ because everything we do is pointing back to Christ everything is pointing back to him we're not trying to build our own platforms or our own names we're going this is Christ did someone get healed it was Christ did someone get freed from a devil it was Christ this may have been the person that was used in this situation Eleazar was used he was the body that was chosen to be there at that moment there have been times when brother William was the body that was chosen to be there at that moment to pray for somebody or to talk to somebody or to be there through a situation and it wasn't so that brother William could get a big name or big platform he was simply the vessel that was chosen to be there at that moment and it doesn't have to be a minister there are times when brother Mitch was the vessel that was chosen or brother Ken or brother Mike or brother Michael brother Donald Sister Mary sister Brianna they were the vessel chosen at that moment there were vessel chosen for that situation but they weren't chosen so that their name could be anything special that's right and the Lord wrought a great Victory on that day that's what all of it goes back to that's what it all goes to is maybe I was the vessel that was there great but it was the Lord that wrought the victory it was the Lord that broke the change it was the Lord that healed the sick it was the Lord that set the captive free it wasn't brother Harry it wasn't brother Wendell brother Josh brother William Brother Daryl brother pick whatever minister's name you want to put in there it was Christ that wrought the victory amen Hebrews 12 and verse 1 wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us elzar had to hold on to his weapon he had to hold it tightly there are times when we have to keep running with patience we have to keep holding on there are times when we have to keep pushing through and keep holding on whether it's figuratively we're holding on as we keep going whether it's literally you're holding on to the object like he was with the sword First Timothy chapter 6 verse 11 but thou oh man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life hold on where unto Thou Art also called and has has professed a good profession before many witnesses Matthew 24 verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure into the end hold on the same shall be saved let's have the musicians go ahead and come 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 7 I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but to them also that love his appearing I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith I held on I didn't let go of my weapon and ultimately as much as we might say that we're holding on to it in the end it turns out that it's holding on to us that's why I say I don't care in the story of Eleazar whether you want to say that it's a natural thing his hand cramped so hard that it was like a vice holding on to it couldn't let go or whether you want to say it was Supernatural that God made that sword hold on to him where he couldn't let it go if he wanted to but ultimately that's where we are in life we hold on to the best of our ability but then ultimately it comes down to him holding on to us we hold on to our weapon we fight the best we can but there's time after time through our lives when it turns around and it's Christ holding us because we couldn't have the strength to hold on to it anymore the weariness is too much we can't physically hold on to it we go past the point of human endurance of human strength of human capability and then the supernatural kicks in and you find out that it's his hand holding you that the weapon is cleaving to your hand and though you may be exhausted you can't drop it cuz you've gone past the point where you can't turn away anymore there's never a question in your mind to go you're like the disciples that said Lord where would we go what would we do there's nothing else I can go to there's nothing else I would take it comes down yes we're supposed to hold on yes we're supposed to to be able to trust our weapon and hold on to it but then part of that trust is we also trust to know that he holds on to us when we're going through the trials in life when we're going through the struggles when we're going through the hard times when we're going through our own mistakes and shortcomings and failures and the times when we would have let go because we messed up and then we find out that he's holding on to us through it all and he's only going to let us go so far before he starts pulling us back he's only going to let us fall so far before he grabs us goes no that's far enough let's get you back where you're supposed to be let's get you back in the fighting line let's get you back on the list of Mighty Warriors because that's what you are you know when we go through that list of Mighty Warriors we don't see it talk about all of their failures and shortcomings it doesn't talk about all the times that they messed up in training it doesn't talk about all the times they didn't care for their sword quite right and maybe it got chipped or maybe something happened or this that or the other or the times maybe they missed an order or did something like that what we see is at the end of the story where they're going now these were the Mighty Warriors and this is what they [Music] did this guy killed 800 people by himself this guy stood in a field and fought off the whole enemy this guy was in this field this guy killed two lions in a time of snow this guy did this these four all killed Giants and there's going to be this whole list that says overcame Le [Music] oysa and when we're on the other side there will people that will go up to you and go how did you overcome Leo DEA and we're not going to be standing there going because I had the faith of I had perfect faith I had this that I had that I had that we're going to look at him and go because the grace of God held on to me the grace of God got me through through every trial through every struggle the grace of God got me through yes what can we sing brother every day I see he's helping me Faithfully to overcome my
