[32:54] to his word you can be seated here
[32:56] tonight
[32:58] and um I figured I would speak a little
[33:01] bit I uh to to the children we we preach
[33:05] a lot to the um uh teenagers and and um
[33:11] the adults but we um I thought tonight I
[33:15] would um uh preach to you to to some of
[33:19] you younger ones of course there's going
[33:21] to be um the teenagers involved in it
[33:24] too Mam and dads where the word of the
[33:26] Lord is for us all
[33:28] but um I I want to to uh title my
[33:33] thoughts tonight the first commandment
[33:35] with
[33:36] promise and um when I heard brother Jude
[33:39] was here I thought oh what a what a
[33:41] sermon for these guys amen y'all to come
[33:44] at this uh for a for a a simple teaching
[33:47] like this but uh but we're glad you're
[33:50] we're glad you're here
[33:52] amen and um you know uh there in
[33:57] Proverbs 6 and
[33:58] 20 it says my son keep thy father's
[34:03] commandment forsake not the law of thy
[34:07] mother bind them continually upon thine
[34:11] heart and tie them about thy neck when
[34:16] thou goest it shall lead thee when thou
[34:21] sleepest it shall keep thee when thou
[34:25] awak it shall talk with the thee for the
[34:29] Commandment is a lamp and the law is
[34:33] light and reproofs of
[34:35] instruction are the way of
[34:39] life I think this is an incredible
[34:43] thing as we read the scripture honor
[34:46] your father for this is the first
[34:48] commandment with promise that it may be
[34:50] well with thee and that you would live
[34:54] long upon the
[34:55] Earth you see though God has so blessed
[35:00] you children and especially you children
[35:03] here that have Christian uh mom and dad
[35:08] that loves
[35:10] yall and um that teaches you in the ways
[35:13] of the
[35:15] Lord and and to uh teach a certain uh uh
[35:21] train simply is is to teach a certain
[35:24] type of behavior through practice and
[35:27] instru instruction over a period of time
[35:29] and the scripture does say in Proverbs
[35:30] 22 and6 train up a child in the way that
[35:34] he should go and when he is old he will
[35:37] not depart from it and so in teaching
[35:43] there's there's three things that us
[35:44] parents know is it's a plan there's
[35:48] instruction and then there's
[35:50] practice and so God gives us Mam and
[35:56] daddies uh to to to train Us in the ways
[36:00] of the
[36:01] Lord and uh to teach us how to be
[36:04] productive uh uh citizens how to behave
[36:10] ourselves how to uh be appreciated by
[36:13] other people uh when you when you go to
[36:16] school um when you've got when you've
[36:20] got uh uh children that know how to
[36:23] respect
[36:25] authority and um uh when when you uh are
[36:30] out in the public and you see uh
[36:33] children that uh behave themselves and
[36:37] answer yes ma'am and yes sir and and
[36:41] open doors for elders and and um you
[36:45] know these kinds of things a a lots this
[36:49] comes
[36:50] from well-behaved children means that
[36:53] there is moms there are moms and dads
[36:57] that that love them that are teaching
[37:00] them uh uh the ways of the
[37:04] Lord and not just the ways of the Lord
[37:07] but every one of us have um we talk
[37:10] about that predestinated seed all the
[37:13] time
[37:15] and we've all been born with a
[37:19] purpose and the purpose that God has has
[37:22] given uh can never come to its
[37:26] completion unless unless God sets
[37:29] boundaries in our lives and when we talk
[37:32] about boundaries we're talking about
[37:36] amen most generally to all of us here
[37:38] 99% they we're talking about moms and
[37:41] dads now I understand that um there's
[37:44] some of you here that that uh have
[37:47] foster parents and but they would be in
[37:50] the same category because man this is
[37:54] this is God's blessings to you it's
[37:59] God's blessings to you now you you take
[38:02] the swamps of
[38:04] Louisiana and um I you kids might not
[38:07] know uh what a swamp is but a swamp is
[38:10] just a bunch of
[38:13] water
[38:16] and excuse me there's a bunch of water
[38:19] and and there's no boundaries there's no
[38:21] there's no edges to it it's just little
[38:24] bit of water and it's swampy and
[38:26] alligator
[38:27] live there and and swampy creatures live
[38:31] there nothing against Louisiana by the
[38:33] way amen and
[38:36] uh
[38:37] and but God don't want our lives to be
[38:41] swampy swamps usually has a lot of
[38:44] skeers and and just a lot of low lion
[38:47] areas that are just don't have anything
[38:50] really really good about them but you
[38:53] see if you take that same water and you
[38:57] put edges you put boundaries on each
[39:00] side of that water and you then you
[39:03] would turn you would turn the old
[39:08] swampy uh alligator infested areas into
[39:12] a river and the more that
[39:15] boundary the the the the closer the
[39:18] boundary gets the the the more
[39:23] powerful the river becomes
[39:27] now I want us to think about that for a
[39:29] few moments I've I preached hard this
[39:31] morning and
[39:32] so I I just want to talk to you kids
[39:35] tonight amen because if we're not
[39:39] appreciative of the gift that God has
[39:42] given you in your mama and daddy then
[39:47] you will you you will not understand the
[39:50] tools that God has given you so you boys
[39:54] and girls how many of you boys and girls
[39:57] have have a little bit of a hard time
[39:59] with liping
[40:01] Mama amen well you're a bunch of liars
[40:05] amen
[40:07] hallelujah hey this guy did now this guy
[40:09] raised his hand it was just a little bit
[40:11] but he raised his hand a little bit amen
[40:13] God bless you Daniel and and so uh uh
[40:18] but but sometimes we
[40:22] do and and if we're not careful you can
[40:26] discourage mama
[40:28] you can cause Mama to cry you can make
[40:31] Mama feel like she's not loved and here
[40:35] God has given you the greatest gift
[40:40] because he's given you someone that
[40:44] stays at home to take care of you and to
[40:48] train you amen and to get you out of the
[40:52] swampy condition now brother bradam
[40:54] would say here I've got a quote here
[40:56] somewhere
[40:58] amen praise the
[41:00] Lord do you love
[41:03] him uh uh uh praise the Lord oh my
[41:07] goodness um
[41:10] amen all right I'll get to it I I'll get
[41:12] to it in a minute but if you're left
[41:15] alone then you then then you miss the
[41:19] the blessing that God has given you to
[41:21] raise you up I think one thing that this
[41:24] generation is missing is we have got and
[41:28] you kids might not understand this but
[41:31] we are a generation where mama is
[41:33] working and daddy is working and we have
[41:37] got we have got a generation that has
[41:40] raised up amen that is neurotic they
[41:44] they they they don't have that closeness
[41:47] they don't have that Bond of a human
[41:50] being that loves them they're all in
[41:53] daycares amen they're they're in a big
[41:55] unit a big group unit and and they are
[41:57] not they're missing the Personal Touch
[42:01] the personal feel from their mother I
[42:04] hope this going to be okay here tonight
[42:06] a personal feel from the woman that
[42:10] loves them and and I I I want to I I I
[42:13] want you to look at that they are out
[42:16] there now you might think that it's fun
[42:19] for those kids not to have M at home and
[42:23] for them to be out playing being away
[42:26] from home all the time but God's blessed
[42:28] you in giving you someone at home that
[42:32] loves you that cares for you that's
[42:36] that's that's looking after you and
[42:38] training you in the ways of the
[42:43] Lord now when I was a kid they didn't
[42:48] have the daycare thing like what we have
[42:51] today all right amen how many of you
[42:54] Elders can say Amen to that the day I
[42:56] mean the daycare was there you could
[42:58] have daycare but but but for the most
[43:00] part you were raised at
[43:02] home we were taught by the by by the I I
[43:06] was I was trained amen how to treat a
[43:11] woman because my dad always came home my
[43:13] mother always I I learned amen uh how a
[43:16] woman is to treat a man I I seen those
[43:19] things but another thing too is I
[43:21] learned the productivity and what it was
[43:25] to become a man amen it was just part of
[43:28] the action I I I was raised in a in in a
[43:33] family that that was uh conscientious
[43:37] that God put us here on the Earth today
[43:40] for a purpose now here we are these many
[43:43] years later I'm
[43:45] 54 now these many years later the
[43:48] majority are of the kids are are at are
[43:52] at daycare they're they're not with
[43:54] their mother and uh amen and and they
[43:58] are just uh so what do they do a mother
[44:01] that don't really care or a woman that
[44:03] don't really care for them she looks
[44:05] after him and makes sure that that the
[44:07] nose is clean and and and and feeds them
[44:09] at 11 or 12:00 amen but she is not a
[44:13] mother to them the Apostle Paul says you
[44:16] have many instructors but not very many
[44:18] fathers and and so amen they they they
[44:23] they they instead of investing love into
[44:26] their lives they have given them uh a
[44:30] tablet they give them a television they
[44:33] give them so they're put just just go
[44:35] sit down be good amen watch the movie do
[44:38] those things there and they and they
[44:41] have lost kids have lost the ability to
[44:46] interact with with the
[44:48] others amen they they they don't know
[44:51] how to
[44:52] work I'm talking about I'm talking about
[44:55] 25 year olds amen still living at home
[44:57] with Mama and there's nothing wrong and
[44:59] I say I say to you teenagers there's
[45:01] nothing wrong with living with home with
[45:02] with Mom and Dad hey if you can save the
[45:04] money and you you keep your money in
[45:06] your you know I mean pay them rent by
[45:08] all means amen but but if you're not
[45:10] having to if you're not having to to to
[45:13] to to pay for the electric and the gas
[45:15] and this and that amen and and stay home
[45:19] hey keep putting the the money in the
[45:21] bank that's that's the way I see about
[45:22] it but you pay your way you you don't
[45:27] you don't you you you're not there uh uh
[45:30] mooching off of your mom and daddy and
[45:33] and and living home free and and
[45:36] watching them struggle to pay the bills
[45:38] and you're not helping to pay the
[45:41] bills amen but you see you see you are
[45:45] you you're not there just uh uh playing
[45:47] your games and and uh uh doing your own
[45:51] thing no God has put us here with a
[45:57] purpose and a boy and a girl that is
[46:01] left to themselves at a daycare
[46:04] somewhere is not learning their purpose
[46:08] so when you got a mother who stays at
[46:11] home and sometimes we look at mom as if
[46:13] who is she anyways I mean I mean you
[46:15] know you're with her all the time and
[46:17] you begin to think well you know and you
[46:19] treat her anyway let me tell you
[46:20] something with that mother that mother
[46:24] is the backbone to your family
[46:29] the reason we've got so much nonsense
[46:32] and so many kids today on drugs and on
[46:36] and and and and and not uh uh uh with so
[46:39] many complexes is because there's not a
[46:42] mother there to keep the home
[46:48] together
[46:50] Hallelujah because Mama's wanting a
[46:53] career Mama's wanting to go to work
[46:55] Mama's wan to do this do that well
[46:57] praise the Lord so to have a mom at home
[47:01] that is there loving you training you
[47:05] teaching you and you might think that
[47:08] well you know listen she's there and
[47:12] with her being there that is the
[47:16] backbone to your
[47:21] family my mother was not a um my mother
[47:24] doesn't spell very well
[47:28] and um uh uh you know my my my mother uh
[47:33] but yet she invested in our lives and
[47:36] you would never known that that she
[47:39] couldn't spell when we were growing up
[47:41] because she was a stickler on us and our
[47:44] and our vocabulary
[47:46] words and learn and she would go back
[47:49] and forth I didn't know I didn't know
[47:50] that Mama wasn't a good speller until I
[47:52] was an adult amen and uh uh but but the
[47:56] thing is is amen but she invested in my
[48:02] life
[48:04] invest there are some people that take
[48:06] care of you and then there's other
[48:07] people that invest there'll be others
[48:10] there'll be plenty that that take care
[48:12] of you that that nurture you along that
[48:14] make you that and and and you would
[48:16] probably survive so is the whole world
[48:18] but there's very few that will
[48:22] invest in you that no matter no matter
[48:27] what you do no matter what you come what
[48:29] no matter what she's going to be there
[48:31] your mom and dad both are going to be
[48:33] there thick and thin from now
[48:37] on Amen going to be there now I think I
[48:43] told you it's going to be simple I think
[48:46] because I'm I'm I'm I want you I want
[48:48] you kids to understand I want youall to
[48:50] understand the
[48:52] importance of respecting and loving your
[48:56] mama and your
[48:57] daddy now mom and dad's got a plan they
[49:01] they they're already looking at the
[49:02] future they're wanting you to be a
[49:03] productive citizen they're wanting you
[49:06] to um uh uh know how to handle
[49:11] yourself Hey listen you see this this
[49:15] this age today this this generation 30
[49:19] years old and don't know how to do
[49:21] anything uh that this is
[49:24] new this is new this is not this this is
[49:27] not the way it's listen the the there
[49:29] was a there was a young boy at the age
[49:31] of 7 years old by the name of Josiah
[49:34] that was king of
[49:37] Israel Jesus amen knew how to handle
[49:41] himself his mom and dad had left for for
[49:44] for three days journey and left him at
[49:47] the a at the temple amen and and at 12
[49:51] years old he knew how to handle himself
[49:54] feed himself he knew how and the the
[49:56] Bible says that even this child this
[50:00] child was so brilliant in his mind that
[50:03] the elders and and the and the preachers
[50:06] were all standing around thinking wow
[50:09] this young man's got it put
[50:13] together 12 years
[50:15] old we could go through it was it was
[50:18] seven years old or or or or or eight
[50:22] years somewhere in there where that that
[50:24] God came down and appeared unto
[50:27] Samuel so what I'm saying is
[50:31] training is
[50:38] important
[50:40] amen
[50:42] mouthiness from a child to an
[50:46] adult is
[50:50] wrong can I get an amen from you young
[50:53] people
[50:57] you say it's not in my heart Yet brother
[50:59] amen I ain't Amen in that amen
[51:02] mouthiness from a child to an
[51:06] adult now detached
[51:09] parenting leaves a child to
[51:13] himself amen and too many times we we'll
[51:18] do that and M and daddies I want to say
[51:20] detach parenting if you've got if you're
[51:22] that kind of a parent don't do that be
[51:26] be a parent that is not passive be an
[51:29] active parent be a part of their lives
[51:32] be a part from the beginning to the end
[51:35] and when they get to that teenage years
[51:37] amen that's not the time and and and
[51:40] especially boys boys want to but boys
[51:43] want to to to to be a man and that's
[51:45] that's the way God has built them to be
[51:47] a man God's built them to be strong and
[51:49] to be and they're and they're and
[51:51] they're pulling and they're pulling away
[51:53] but remember that young man or that
[51:56] young young girl the young lady needs
[52:00] you as a parent you are part of who they
[52:05] are
[52:07] now you see we when we and and and
[52:11] that's something for you young men and
[52:13] young women you teenagers to always keep
[52:15] that in mind listen God's given you a
[52:19] bond you you boys God's given you a bond
[52:23] and that Bond must never break that Bond
[52:27] will be there amen that's your
[52:29] foundation that God gave you today I am
[52:33] 54 years old and I still have the
[52:37] greatest honor and respect for my mother
[52:40] and father I I am I am
[52:45] 54 and I if the Lord should ever take
[52:48] them
[52:49] home oh it'll hurt it'll hurt brother
[52:52] Merl you you you lost your dad here a
[52:55] couple years ago it hurts
[52:59] you see because there's been an
[53:01] investment in your lives
[53:06] now the scripture says there in Proverbs
[53:10] uh 29 and
[53:12] 15 the rod and reproof give
[53:17] wisdom amen the rod the
[53:21] belt and
[53:24] repr reproof gives wisdom
[53:28] and a child hey you you kids I want
[53:30] youall to either read it in your Bible
[53:32] or look up there and a Child Left to
[53:35] himself or herself bringeth his or her
[53:40] mother to
[53:47] shame so here's the deal if Mama lets
[53:51] you go I'm G to pick come going pick on
[53:54] you if your mama lets you you go and and
[53:58] you and you're lying to Mama and you're

[54:08] be one that's got all these bad habits
[54:10] about you and you know what your mom
[54:13] will have to go like this

[54:20] um you see what I'm
[54:22] saying so

[54:27] ashamed saying oh I don't know whose
[54:29] girl that is that is her daddy's
[54:32] girl see God wants us to bring those who
[54:38] are investing in our lives honor I think
[54:42] that's the greatest thing we could ever
[54:46] give a a a a a parent is someone who is
[54:51] investing love in your life investing
[54:55] their time in your life life you being
[54:58] and bringing honor to them when someone
[55:02] when when when when uh uh Nathaniel is
[55:06] is is investing his love and sister
[55:09] Katrina is investing her love into your
[55:12] life the greatest thing that you could
[55:15] ever do is give honor and respect to
[55:21] them that's that's the way you would do
[55:23] that you see because
[55:26] it it it it tells them I'm proud of who
[55:32] you're making
[55:35] me I'm proud that you are helping me to
[55:40] overcome some of these things in my life

[59:36] preaching uh to to to uh apparent
[59:41] correcting he says listen hard preaching
[59:43] sometimes it'll keep your church leveled
[59:45] up it'll keep it'll keep it what God
[59:48] Said like sometimes if I hate to do is
[59:52] correct my children or give them a
[59:54] weapon I just hate hate to do
[1:00:00] that the worst thing one of the last
[1:00:03] things I wanted to ever do to my boys
[1:00:06] they might not believe that was to equip
[1:00:10] them or correct them I felt yucky I
[1:00:14] didn't like I just don't I want people
[1:00:17] to like me especially my
[1:00:21] kids right come on how many of you
[1:00:23] parents how many of you parents just do

[1:00:40] being corrected well your dad don't like
[1:00:41] correcting
[1:00:42] you but it's a
[1:00:45] requirement it's got to be it's part of
[1:00:50] what it is now brother Bram would say it
[1:00:53] say I you know anything I hate to do is
[1:00:55] a my children or give them a whon I just
[1:00:58] hate to do that but yet the Bible says
[1:01:00] to do it and you watch these little
[1:01:02] people today that don't whip their
[1:01:04] children and correct them find out what
[1:01:06] they got they got a smart elet that'll
[1:01:09] stomp their foot and slam an orange
[1:01:11] against the wall and ball you out the
[1:01:13] parents see that's it the Bible is right
[1:01:17] in everything isn't that right the Bible
[1:01:20] is right in
[1:01:22] everything so so God is is wanting
[1:01:25] something
[1:01:26] and I and I and I want to talk to you
[1:01:28] parents uh uh just just for a moment
[1:01:30] amen don't ever get
[1:01:33] discouraged don't ever get don't ever
[1:01:35] get weary in well
[1:01:38] doing don't ever get downhearted and say
[1:01:41] I just don't know
[1:01:43] mamas you're having an effect upon your
[1:01:46] children and mamas we need you we love
[1:01:51] you daddies do you love your mama or
[1:01:53] your your wife amen the children's Mama
[1:01:58] amen you you love them so so
[1:02:02] everything that is that is that is uh uh
[1:02:07] uh worth having comes with a price and
[1:02:10] you Mama's got to understand that amen
[1:02:13] the natural progression of the universe
[1:02:16] amen is movement from order to chaos
[1:02:20] it's not the other way around amen it's
[1:02:24] it's it's it's just the oppos opposite
[1:02:26] there is there is a force to bring
[1:02:30] destruction and it and it requires you
[1:02:32] to have a vision and say no I've got to
[1:02:35] keep this
[1:02:38] together I i' I've got to have a vision
[1:02:42] here because if you don't amen it's the
[1:02:47] natural thing of the universe to pull
[1:02:50] apart to to to to to to to
[1:02:54] fragment and and and to destruct and a
[1:02:58] family left to itself is
[1:03:01] self-destructive a Child Left to himself
[1:03:04] herself is
[1:03:08] self-destructive Mama you're the nucleus
[1:03:11] you're
[1:03:13] the you're the one that God's ordained
[1:03:17] to keep the
[1:03:19] home that is out working in the in the
[1:03:22] in in working on the on the job he's out
[1:03:26] taking care of this and that and you're
[1:03:29] the
[1:03:30] one you're the one that God is has for
[1:03:35] ordained and
[1:03:37] predestinated to be there for your
[1:03:42] children
[1:03:45] now I I want us to to to think of that
[1:03:48] because amen the only way that we're
[1:03:51] going to beat the
[1:03:53] curse amen is to invest energy into the
[1:03:57] project or into the the the the object
[1:04:01] the only way to beat the curse a Child
[1:04:03] Left to himself will
[1:04:05] self-destruct Satan will take him and
[1:04:08] destroy him that's just the way it is so
[1:04:12] if we are going to help this boy or this
[1:04:15] boy or this boy or this boy or this boy
[1:04:19] or this boy it is going to require
[1:04:22] someone with a vision and someone with
[1:04:25] the energy
[1:04:26] to put it and keep it all together even
[1:04:29] though it seems sometimes it's trying to
[1:04:31] come apart every which
[1:04:34] direction but God's blessed you
[1:04:37] mamas God's blessed you children with
[1:04:42] Ms can you say
[1:04:45] Amen so to set those boundaries without
[1:04:49] rules you young
[1:04:51] people don't learn the appropriate way
[1:04:53] to behave without structure
[1:04:56] you
[1:04:58] children don't develop
[1:05:01] security without structure your children
[1:05:04] don't you you you children don't develop
[1:05:07] the ability to
[1:05:09] master
[1:05:13] self-discipline amen are y'all is this
[1:05:16] okay here
[1:05:18] tonight without
[1:05:21] structure give me an example brother
[1:05:24] Wendell sure I didn't think you'd
[1:05:27] ask mom says it's time to go to bed at
[1:05:29] 8:00 you say but Mom and and she don't
[1:05:34] want to tell you to get ready for bed at
[1:05:36] 8:00 cuz every night you are on her all
[1:05:40] the way till 10:00 until she just wants
[1:05:42] to go and
[1:05:45] cry but because she knows structure is
[1:05:50] important she puts her neck out on the
[1:05:53] line knowing that you're just going to
[1:05:55] throw yourself a little hissy
[1:05:59] fit because she's wanting to teach
[1:06:04] you
[1:06:06] discipline am I doing all right over
[1:06:08] here teenage guys amen
[1:06:12] hallelujah
[1:06:15] discipline so so if we if we want and
[1:06:18] the greatest thing I think the greatest
[1:06:20] thing that we could ever
[1:06:23] have sometimes you kids especially you
[1:06:26] know you these girls get all pretty and
[1:06:28] woof we've got some pretty girls in here
[1:06:31] and and we got some handsome fellas in

[1:06:38] or mustache and uh we're we and and man
[1:06:42] we're we're going around we think we
[1:06:43] can't wait till the day we get married

[1:07:15] mouth shut whenever mom and dad's trying
[1:07:17] to talk to you you ain't got no

[1:07:26] God sets the
[1:07:29] boundaries hallelujah amen God puts the
[1:07:35] boundaries and he says stay in the
[1:07:39] confinement of these
[1:07:41] boundaries he is training you to bring

[1:08:33] boundaries you get to choose to do the
[1:08:35] right thing when the boundaries are
[1:08:43] set and when you learn that you are
[1:08:47] safe when you're in the boundaries mama

[1:09:31] boundaries there is nothing worse than a
[1:09:33] young person that knows everything about
[1:09:39] everything and it's
[1:09:45] constantly I was going to say no I'm not
[1:09:47] going to look this way and I'm not going
[1:09:49] to I'm just I'm just going to just keep
[1:09:50] my eyes open while I'm a
[1:09:52] preaching that's constantly wanting to C

[1:10:27] around them it's a bully nature that
[1:10:35] says you're a
[1:10:38] bully you're not a
[1:10:41] leader a leader is confident in who they
[1:10:45] are a leader has a purpose a Leader's
[1:10:49] got a go a leader is a
[1:10:53] leader because he has the best interest

[1:11:34] want is go a Christian is always looking
[1:11:39] for the best
[1:11:41] interest of somebody
[1:11:43] else so if I say oh don't touch that I'm
[1:11:47] not doing that because well I want to
[1:11:50] touch it so don't you
[1:11:53] take no I know that if you touch that
[1:11:56] and it's real hot and you don't know
[1:11:58] it's hot you're going to hurt yourself
[1:12:01] so I am stand if there is a command as a
[1:12:03] child one one young person to the other
[1:12:06] and there's and and and you're reaching
[1:12:07] out to try it's because you know that
[1:12:11] that they're going to hurt themselves or
[1:12:12] there's going to be you're not trying to
[1:12:16] to to to keep them under your thumb
[1:12:19] you're trying to help them
[1:12:25] praise the Lord so when we look at one
[1:12:29] another amen our our and I will say that
[1:12:33] we are
[1:12:35] all born very selfish we're all born
[1:12:39] bullies we all want things our way done
[1:12:42] our way and parenting those who are
[1:12:46] subjecting themselves to their parents
[1:12:48] at
[1:12:49] home will portray that when they're away
[1:12:52] from home they will show
[1:12:56] amen out of the good character of their
[1:12:58] heart what they're learning because Mom
[1:13:01] is not kicking you all over the place
[1:13:04] because because you're being uh uh uh uh
[1:13:07] because you're you're I say kicking all
[1:13:09] over I better watch what I say with the
[1:13:11] internet she's she she's not demanding
[1:13:14] things for her own she is trying to
[1:13:18] teach you how to be a productive citizen
[1:13:23] and to be a help uh uh to to to to be a
[1:13:27] a a human being with
[1:13:30] purpose
[1:13:32] amen all
[1:13:34] right praise the Lord do you love
[1:13:39] him the Bible says there in Proverbs 23
[1:13:42] and 13 this is the way they used to do
[1:13:44] it back in back when I was a kid this
[1:13:46] scripture was used a
[1:13:48] lot Proverbs 23 and 13 withhold not
[1:13:51] correction from the
[1:13:53] child for if thou beat him or chastise
[1:13:56] him with a rod he shall not
[1:13:59] die and I'm a living proof I didn't die
[1:14:02] there was times I thought I
[1:14:09] was that's right that's God's
[1:14:13] way now if you've got
[1:14:16] parents that are giving that to you I'm
[1:14:20] asking all of you young people to really
[1:14:23] stop and think about that
[1:14:27] Lord and especially if you're Lippy with
[1:14:30] your
[1:14:31] Mam and your
[1:14:33] daddies and you and you've always got to
[1:14:35] have some to say back I want you tonight
[1:14:38] to
[1:14:39] repent because this is bad character
[1:14:42] from a boy and a girl very bad
[1:14:44] especially if you're fixing to be
[1:14:46] teenagers or if you are teenagers it's
[1:14:48] not good it's not good quality for a
[1:14:52] young man and a young woman to have
[1:14:56] that's not discounting you you you you
[1:14:58] younger ones neither amen but we what we
[1:15:02] do is we want to repent and we want to
[1:15:04] ask Lord help me give me the grace to
[1:15:08] stay Within These boundaries that you
[1:15:11] have given me can you say Amen now what
[1:15:16] should our attitude be Proverbs
[1:15:19] 12:1 who so loveth
[1:15:22] instruction loves knowledge
[1:15:26] but he that hateth Repro reproof is
[1:15:30] brutish that word brutish is
[1:15:35] stupid that's the good old that's that's
[1:15:38] that's that's that's that's one of the
[1:15:39] definitions it's one that that that's
[1:15:41] not thinking so one who doesn't like uh
[1:15:46] in
[1:15:47] instruction and and reproof is is is is
[1:15:51] is is is not thinking
[1:15:53] correctly the ible says there in
[1:15:55] Proverbs 27 and5 open rebuke rebuke is
[1:15:59] better than secret
[1:16:02] love amen
[1:16:05] amen Proverbs 9 and 7 I want you to turn
[1:16:08] to that let's all turn
[1:16:10] there won't be holding you too much
[1:16:12] longer now
[1:16:29] Proverbs 9 and7 he that reproveth a
[1:16:34] scorer GTH to himself
[1:16:38] shame he that rebuke a wicked man GTH
[1:16:43] himself a
[1:16:46] blot reprove not a scorner lest he hate
[1:16:50] thee re rebuke a wise man and he will
[1:16:56] love
[1:16:58] thee give instruction to a wise man and
[1:17:03] he will yet be
[1:17:05] wiser teach a just man and he will
[1:17:10] increase in
[1:17:12] learning so if there is a scorner one
[1:17:16] that is
[1:17:17] scorning and you're when you're when
[1:17:20] you're and especially and and you know
[1:17:23] sometimes kids you know I guess they do
[1:17:25] it to their to their dad
[1:17:27] too
[1:17:31] um but lots you know Dad's ain't going
[1:17:33] to just you know Dad's dad's not in
[1:17:35] their nature to put up with it
[1:17:39] and
[1:17:40] uh but but but you you work your mama
[1:17:43] over and and
[1:17:48] um and and and correction reproof is
[1:17:52] given to to to a a boy or girl and and
[1:17:57] that that's a
[1:17:59] scorner and and then he'll turn that
[1:18:01] thing right back
[1:18:03] around turn that thing right back around
[1:18:05] on his mama and make her look like the
[1:18:11] fool and and and
[1:18:13] sometimes you kids can win you win the
[1:18:17] argument because Mama's not trying to
[1:18:21] argue mom's got the facts
[1:18:25] and you can spin this thing all around
[1:18:27] but the fact is if you're a
[1:18:31] scorner the Bible says to just not even
[1:18:34] worry about you that you're going to go
[1:18:36] and do your own thing but I
[1:18:39] say if there's a heart to
[1:18:43] repent and to quit being a scorner when
[1:18:46] someone is trying to instruct you and
[1:18:48] reprove you then you've still got a
[1:18:52] hope but those that the scripture says
[1:18:54] leave him alone don't even rebuke
[1:18:59] him I don't want God to ever do that to
[1:19:03] me I don't want to be one when God's
[1:19:06] correcting
[1:19:07] me but see I learned that when I was a
[1:19:10] kid I want to do that which is right
[1:19:14] with the authority that God's put me
[1:19:17] under can you say man see but on the
[1:19:22] other hand rebuke a wise man and he'll
[1:19:24] love you
[1:19:26] re you you give instruction to a wise
[1:19:28] man and he'll be
[1:19:31] wiser someone comes up and says hey you
[1:19:36] know as a young man you I I've noticed
[1:19:39] this and he'll say thank you I I
[1:19:43] appreciate that I haven't noticed that I
[1:19:46] appreciate
[1:19:48] that then that shows that heart shows
[1:19:52] that you're wise in your heart to accept
[1:19:56] correction it also shows that you're
[1:19:59] willing to add to your wisdom and you
[1:20:02] will continue to grow and become wiser
[1:20:04] and wiser as you
[1:20:06] go but any man that
[1:20:09] despises correction and despises
[1:20:12] Authority at their youth when they get
[1:20:14] older it'll it'll it'll just constantly
[1:20:17] be something that they have to battle
[1:20:19] against then you'll never be able to
[1:20:21] respect your pastor you'll never be able
[1:20:22] to respect this respect that you'll
[1:20:24] never
[1:20:25] and God is trying to train you and you
[1:20:27] ladies would never be able to respect
[1:20:29] your
[1:20:30] husband the way that you should so God
[1:20:34] I'm going back am I am I doing okay here
[1:20:36] for for you kids so so God has given you
[1:20:40] these things to bring it out for you to
[1:20:45] grow and prosper somebody say Prosper he
[1:20:49] wants us to
[1:20:51] prosper all right Proverbs 19 and2

[1:26:12] worthy of double honor especially they
[1:26:17] who labor in the word and Doctrine
[1:26:19] double honor that means if Mama and

[1:26:58] word and Doctrine for the scripture
[1:26:59] saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
[1:27:02] tread out the corn the labor is worthy
[1:27:03] of its reward receive not an uh against
[1:27:07] an elder receive not an accusation but
[1:27:09] before two or three Witnesses in other
[1:27:12] words you you trust and you respect your
[1:27:17] your mother your father you love them
[1:27:20] you give them there in Proverbs 1 and7
[1:27:23] Fe fear the fear of the Lord is the
[1:27:27] beginning of
[1:27:29] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[1:27:35] understanding the fear of the Lord is
[1:27:39] what now the fear of the Lord does not
[1:27:41] mean I'm scared of the lord it's the
[1:27:43] respect the
[1:27:45] reverence and when I reverence God and I
[1:27:49] love
[1:27:50] God then who are the ones who are the
[1:27:53] ones that are your instruction who are
[1:27:57] the ones that's given you
[1:27:58] knowledge it's these two right here so
[1:28:01] the the the the fear of the Lord the
[1:28:05] respect of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:28:07] knowledge that you are receiving from
[1:28:09] him and her you've got a respect
[1:28:13] therefore the Lord is teaching you
[1:28:15] everyone understand that amen all right

[1:30:01] be
[1:30:02] teachable amen I like this and I want to
[1:30:05] read this quote to you before we it's a
[1:30:08] little lengthy but then I'll close
[1:30:11] brother bradam preached a message how
[1:30:13] can I overcome then
[1:30:16] 63 he
[1:30:18] says the same now in each age the same
[1:30:21] overcome when they each son of each each
[1:30:25] son out of each Church age overcome the
[1:30:27] temptation of that age I've got the
[1:30:30] scriptures here I don't think we really
[1:30:31] have time to make it through it he says
[1:30:33] as I said in the beginning you are born
[1:30:36] defeated that birth can never bring you
[1:30:39] to life because you were born
[1:30:41] defeated you're in a defeated World
[1:30:44] among defeated people amongst defeated
[1:30:47] Creeds defeated
[1:30:50] denominations and you've got to come to
[1:30:52] Victory some way
[1:30:54] so every one of us you say well I
[1:30:56] struggle I I I'm I'm struggling with
[1:30:59] Lipp that's okay that's
[1:31:03] okay you say that's okay
[1:31:08] yes as long as you're willing to be
[1:31:13] taught
[1:31:15] amen he says at the birth you you come
[1:31:17] you you uh
[1:31:19] at and that birth you can never come to
[1:31:21] life because you're born defeated you're
[1:31:23] in a defeated world it's just like a
[1:31:25] lily a lily I think is one of the most
[1:31:27] prettiest flowers there is I'm very fond
[1:31:31] of those little kala lies and pond lies
[1:31:34] I I think there's hardly there's nothing
[1:31:37] hardly as pretty as a good as a great
[1:31:40] big Pond Lily call it a water lily how
[1:31:43] it's Radiance now where does it come
[1:31:46] from it's a little seed down in the
[1:31:49] bottom of a muddy Mucky Pond and the
[1:31:51] little seed yet all the radiance that'll
[1:31:53] ever shine in
[1:31:54] is in it right then when it's in that
[1:31:58] mud now I just want you youngans to
[1:32:00] think about that now maybe I brought in
[1:32:03] some things here tonight and maybe
[1:32:04] you're as mouthy as can be and maybe
[1:32:06] you're a little defiant and maybe
[1:32:08] whatever you're going through I'm W you
[1:32:10] kids to know that right now on the
[1:32:13] inside of you is the seat of
[1:32:18] God Mama daddies do y'all believe that
[1:32:21] it's the seed of God on the inside out
[1:32:24] of you to bring you into into your
[1:32:28] completion now watch this he says I
[1:32:30] think there's hardly ever he says what
[1:32:31] does it come from it's a little seed
[1:32:33] down the bottom of the muddy Mony Pond
[1:32:34] that little seed he says he says uh uh
[1:32:38] uh but it's but it has to strive
[1:32:41] daily knowing that there is there is
[1:32:43] something it's it's it's black it's
[1:32:45] dirty it's Mucky it's slimy in that
[1:32:47] slime that that it's living in yet it
[1:32:50] presses its way through the mud and the
[1:32:52] muck and the waters and the stagnant
[1:32:54] places until it sticks its head above in
[1:32:56] the light and expresses what's been hid
[1:32:58] in it all the time I think that's an
[1:33:01] overcomer that once in sin once did
[1:33:03] things that was wrong don't worry about
[1:33:05] it now see once once did things that was
[1:33:08] wrong then now why look back into the
[1:33:12] pond again he says God by predestination
[1:33:15] see has brought this seed to life and
[1:33:18] it's pressing itself it's coming to
[1:33:20] light now on top of all of that it has
[1:33:22] overcome doesn't Express itself down
[1:33:25] there it's getting up to express itself
[1:33:28] and I you you kids understand that see
[1:33:30] God God's bringing that thing right out
[1:33:32] of
[1:33:33] us glory to God and though your Mam and
[1:33:37] daddies were once right there in y'all
[1:33:39] situations and sometimes it was rough in
[1:33:40] their lives but God brought them out and
[1:33:44] he's going to continue to do that with
[1:33:45] you now watch he
[1:33:48] says he says it's he says neither did
[1:33:50] you in your sin adultery and the things
[1:33:52] you lived in you didn't Express nothing
[1:33:54] there was a seed in there it and and but
[1:33:57] yet there was a seed in there and it got
[1:33:58] a chance to press into that light now
[1:34:00] you're in the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:34:01] with the sunlight it brought you it
[1:34:04] brought out what you was in the
[1:34:06] beginning see what I mean you you saw
[1:34:08] light you bloomed out you laid your
[1:34:10] heart open and now you're a lily you
[1:34:13] remember my sermon on the Lily Reverend
[1:34:15] Lily he he
[1:34:16] toils yet he does not spin yet Solomon
[1:34:19] and all of his glory is not AR raid with
[1:34:21] one of these look at him he takes
[1:34:24] nothing for himself the Lily don't care
[1:34:27] about himself what does he do he throws
[1:34:29] his Beauty out his life that others
[1:34:32] might see his life is expressed out that
[1:34:35] others might see the glory what's in him
[1:34:37] that's that was in him in the mud and
[1:34:40] now he's on top that's the Overcomer he
[1:34:43] overcome the mud he overcome the things
[1:34:46] of the world now he freely gives himself
[1:34:48] out everybody can look at him his life
[1:34:51] you can't put a finger on it he's a real
[1:34:53] Overcomer
[1:34:54] you can't say nothing about him now he
[1:34:56] came out of the mud who you say well he
[1:34:58] came out of the mud but he's not in the
[1:35:00] mud now he's on top of it you can't
[1:35:03] point back what he was what is he now
[1:35:06] he's on top then the bee comes by and
[1:35:09] and say Ah that's wonderful per perfume
[1:35:12] I believe I'll go and get my part he
[1:35:14] just opens up his heart come on now all
[1:35:17] right everything takes from him he's a
[1:35:19] real Pastor he expresses the glory of
[1:35:22] God he looks where he where he come from
[1:35:24] he had he had to overcome to do that and
[1:35:27] one time he or she was young and fair
[1:35:30] and beautiful they had a lot of
[1:35:32] Temptations to go through but they
[1:35:34] overcome that they overcome now they're
[1:35:37] expressing the real beauty of Christ in
[1:35:39] their life expressing it through the mud
[1:35:42] Jesus gave us the example how to do it
[1:35:44] now we want to know how to overcome
[1:35:47] Jesus told us how to overcome
[1:35:51] humility somebody say humility
[1:35:55] humility is the ability to
[1:35:58] say I don't have the answer humility is
[1:36:03] the ability to say sorry when I'm wrong
[1:36:07] humility is the ability to
[1:36:09] say I want to trust Mom and Dad humility
[1:36:14] is the ability to say not my will but
[1:36:18] God's will be done in me amen he says
[1:36:22] now he he says he he says humility GED
[1:36:25] himself with a towel washed the
[1:36:26] disciples feet and wiped them the very
[1:36:27] God Of Heaven humiliated himself we
[1:36:29] don't want to be humiliated that's the
[1:36:31] reason women don't want their hair to
[1:36:33] grow out and the reason they don't want
[1:36:35] to dress like ladies should dress and
[1:36:37] men don't want to it's it's the same
[1:36:39] thing they don't they they they they get
[1:36:42] humiliated but God but Jesus constantly
[1:36:45] look who he was greatness I'm going to
[1:36:47] say something greatness humiliates
[1:36:51] itself great humbles itself greatness
[1:36:56] I've had the privilege of getting and I
[1:36:58] want you kids to listen to this I've had
[1:37:00] the privilege of getting to meet some
[1:37:02] great men it's these guys that's got a
[1:37:04] change of clothes and 50 cents in their
[1:37:06] pocket to Rattle that that's the guy
[1:37:08] that thinks he's something when he's
[1:37:10] nothing but I've stood by Great Men I
[1:37:12] mean great men with ragged sleeves and
[1:37:15] cuffs they they make you think you're
[1:37:17] the great person greatness is humility
[1:37:21] don't forget that church
[1:37:24] greatness is expressed in humility not
[1:37:28] how fine you can be I I don't mean dirty
[1:37:32] I I mean humble in spirit I don't mean
[1:37:35] just get out and go go to wash and clean
[1:37:37] up well you should do that you know that
[1:37:39] you see but I'm talking about humility
[1:37:42] genuine humility not something that is
[1:37:44] put on something that is that's real
[1:37:47] humility Jesus told us how to do it
[1:37:50] overcome means to stand the test
[1:37:54] stand the test overcome means God's
[1:37:58] going to send test our way and it's
[1:38:00] important that we pass
[1:38:02] it you see what I'm saying and that goes
[1:38:05] for you all you teenagers as well all of
[1:38:08] y'all amen stand the
[1:38:10] test mamas and daddies all of us we all

[1:38:17] Saints did like Jesus did like amongst
[1:38:19] uh uh amongst all of his enemies he
[1:38:21] stood the test everything he was tested
[1:38:22] against he stood he stood it in the very
[1:38:25] face of sickness and him being Messiah
[1:38:26] and he healed them in the face of death
[1:38:28] he brought it back to life in the face
[1:38:30] of Calvary his own death he defeated it
[1:38:32] by surrendering himself why by the word
[1:38:35] destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up
[1:38:37] in three days the word said so in the
[1:38:38] presence of death he defeated it he

[1:40:45] fellow but you all know what I what what
[1:40:48] I
[1:40:49] found as a
[1:40:51] kid is when I found my
[1:40:55] nature was so
[1:40:59] contrary when I when I was just
[1:41:01] constantly having to bite my tongue and
[1:41:03] when I was just
[1:41:07] constantly making my mama cry I was
[1:41:12] just you know what that done for
[1:41:15] me it drove me to
[1:41:19] prayer as a
[1:41:22] boy that that's when I learned to really
[1:41:26] pray because I knew it wasn't pleasing
[1:41:28] to the
[1:41:30] Lord and I knew that I deeply loved my
[1:41:34] mother I didn't want to see her
[1:41:38] cry I didn't want to hurt her
[1:41:41] feelings and I sure didn't want to hear
[1:41:43] my dad get known to me for making my
[1:41:45] mama
[1:41:48] cry you know what I
[1:41:51] done that's when me in
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:56] Jesus started a
[1:42:02] relationship that's when I really got
[1:42:04] serious with God said Lord help
[1:42:10] me and mama can tell you as a kid I did
[1:42:13] I spent hours in prayer as a
[1:42:16] boy a lot of people thought that I was
[1:42:18] just trying to be spiritual oh no oh no
[1:42:27] there was a lot of rebellion in
[1:42:29] me there was a lot of junk in me as a
[1:42:33] kid and there was something in me that
[1:42:36] wanted to please the Lord and I would I
[1:42:39] would go to the church on a daily basis
[1:42:42] I would go by myself all the time and I
[1:42:45] would just say
[1:42:47] God help me
[1:42:54] I would walk up and down i' I'd want to
[1:42:57] pour my hair out at times said God help
[1:43:05] me because I knew God give me the
[1:43:08] boundaries I respected that I knew my
[1:43:11] parents loved me I knew what they were
[1:43:14] trying to do for
[1:43:20] me and my will
[1:43:24] was screaming
[1:43:28] out but did you know what God done for
[1:43:31] me God helped me as a little
[1:43:35] boy and it began to mold character in
[1:43:38] me and begin to teach
[1:43:42] me and what I learned
[1:43:45] there as a
[1:43:47] kid is something that I
[1:43:50] have built upon in my adult
[1:43:56] life learned how to humble
[1:43:59] myself I learned how to say I'm
[1:44:03] wrong I learned how to say
[1:44:06] sorry I learned how to rise above
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:13] it I've
[1:44:16] learned that if I'm
[1:44:20] anything it will be because he's
[1:44:22] pleasing with
[1:44:25] me I've made a lot of
[1:44:27] money I've lost a lot of
[1:44:31] money I've had nice
[1:44:34] things just to see him go to
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:43] rest for me
[1:44:47] things are not
[1:44:50] important there's one thing
[1:44:54] that I want to
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:57] hear I want to hear my daddy my heavenly
[1:45:03] daddy say I'm well
[1:45:09] pleased I want to hear him welcome me
[1:45:13] home I want to hear him
[1:45:16] say job well done
[1:45:19] son that's what I want to hear
[1:45:24] that's what I'm striving to
[1:45:30] hear and I think if we keep that kind of
[1:45:32] thing in
