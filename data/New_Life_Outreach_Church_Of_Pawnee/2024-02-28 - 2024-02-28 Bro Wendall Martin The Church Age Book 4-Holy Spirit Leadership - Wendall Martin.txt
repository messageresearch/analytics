his wife and then driving driving this way and so uh brother brother Josh took him to Claremore this morning or this evening uh he's preaching for brother Bryce so we want to be praying for them as well let's look here in uh Revelations 2 and6 but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for your your goodness to us your love to us Lord thank you for healing our bodies and encouraging us when we're discouraged thank you for the power of the Holy ho spirit so good to see our friends Lord from Texas and just ask Lord that you will bless them bless their meetings this weekend and just pray Lord that you would be with us here tonight as we lord look look a little bit more into the church ages and just ask your Holy Spirit would be pleased Lord minister to us you be the speaker here tonight and that would bless our all of our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen so we um we're going to going to minister this evening on um um we're just going to deal a little bit on the Holy Holy Spirit leadership and brother uh Harry um done a wonderful job um a couple Wednesday nights ago dealing with ncol platonism yall enjoy that brother Harry ministered in church ages and so he had he and and you know were the the the man taking the place of the Holy Ghost in the body and and making it a political Affair instead of individuals being led and governed by the Holy Ghost now I want I want us to say want us to keep in mind this whole the whole essence of the church age book is to show us where the life where Satan uh has has propagated to take the life of God out of the church now that's his desire now we're we're going to be learning doctrines there's going to be plenty of things as you as you have already been going through the church ages but the the doctrines but but you're going to see almost in every page the holy spirit amen Satan trying to anoint men to take the anointing and take the leadership of the Holy Spirit out of out of the church so we want we must if you don't have the Holy Spirit you don't have life you you you're not born again you're you're you're you're not even on first base can you say Amen now we're thankful for for justification we're thankful for sanctification but the ultimate goal is for the Holy Spirit to to f these Tabernacles he's not filling a tabernacle he's filling these Tabernacles and so amen um so I I I thought before we got into reading Amen brother just just a few real short um excerpts here from different messages brother Bram would say the the Holy Spirit was sent to lead men to be the wife Watchman of our soul returning Jubilee He says God wants to lead men men just can't lead themselves amen looking at the Unseen he says when God made man he made him thus for he made him uh a a certain compartment in the man for his throne his control tower God wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself therefore uh there is a War constantly so so we know that the Warfare is going on it's your it's your two Natures it's the white dog and the and the black dog it's the it's it's the Apostle Paul says within me I find two laws amen there's the law of life and then there is there is the the the the fleshly it's your spirit man your fleshly nature and and so he says one man wants to go after what he sees uh and and there's where he's deceived that's where Satan deceived Eve goes on down it says God wants to lead men so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man would be led of the by the Holy by the spirit of God getting off on his own leading is what separated him from his Fellowship so so we we can see man that that this nician Spirit remember it would before it became a Doctrine the it was deeds and so this is the age of Deeds Deeds that that means it wasn't men teaching it was men following their own opinions following what they thought was right following what they uh felt was the best thing for them and God and so and in doing so they are usurping their Authority which is simply there there is no Authority but they're usurping their opinions as uh author authority over God's word and so Amen in other words he wants to serve God on his own terms uh uh and these are the Deeds of the nicians it is the Conquering of the Ley this was a spirit that was at work can you say amen and so brother Brandon would teach us remember they left their first love so this was no longer their absolute their opinions of what the word said mattered more to them than what God's word said and so I I I think it's I think it's very important because amen we've got to watch that spirit of nianis in every one of our hearts because you can minister to that as as um as a uh uh I got a beetle here crawling on me well anyways so if uh I'm glad it wasn't a tick but we if you you don't want to you don't want to minister unbelief to your children to your wife to your in other words there there should be an absolute in your heart for this word this message must be thus sayeth the Lord in every area of your life amen so if you're not careful you if you leave one word out it will go down to your children and and and and and your uh uh lackness will affect those under you amen and so we we we've got to teach we've got to believe every word of God we've got to teach our children through our example through our opinions through our through through our attitudes amen that God's word is the absolute can you say amen amen now now you know something is is just as simple as as as as as let's just use uh a church attendance cuz it's going to be in our next it's going to be in our next uh uh quote here that I'm going to going to read before we get in the church age book and and um Church you know it it's easy it's easy for us to just sort of push that off when when in all reality you are you are putting your opinion above that which God says and his word and in presuming brother Brandon would say now you that claim you have the Holy Ghost and and you that's got long hair wear your dresses neat everything like that and you stay home on Wednesday night to watch a program a television program instead of going to church for prayer meeting you're presuming you've got the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost is in there the love of God Is So constrained in you you just can't stay away from those people you that has to be for first to prayer amen so so brother brother brandom would tell us now the love if you if having your first love then it's the opposite of law but when you lose your love then it becomes the law and he says as as I've often said I don't run around with other women because I'm afraid my wife will divorce me I don't run around with other women because I love my wife he says I don't believe that you should run around but a law isn't what keeps it my marriage vows it's my love it's the reason I love God not because I'm afraid he'll send me to hell I don't believe he'd do that I I I but because I love him so much I don't want to do it there is nothing in me to make me do it I love him too much I wouldn't hurt him for nothing certainly I love him and when men and women get to a place well I really ought to you I I want to stay home to see you know a play tonight or uh but if if if I if I tell you they'll they'll think that I'm backslid if I don't go on down to the church and and he says and you sat there and sleep anyhow you might as well have stayed home and look at something that you enjoy more when your joy becomes the Lord and the Lord is your joy you can't stay away from church then you're getting somewhere so he's bringing it right back to the first love the love that you love nothing else matters but Christ nothing else matters it well I'm old enough I don't need it don't matter every word of God Eve just forsook one word can you say Amen so amen so when we when we look at this everyone is to participate in worship that was what God birthed this church it was every one of us and when one is missing out of that link it it affects it affects the whole body it affects everything so to understand that the life of God is dependent upon this conduit just like it's dependent on your conduit your your wire your you are youen you are the reciprocal for the presence of God Amen are y'all are y'all following me so far so what was the nickan spirit to do amen now everyone again was to participate in worship not just the pastor not just the Deacon not just the choir not just the song leader amen that would be cand worship that's that's where the church has become today it's cand worship you come in and there's a few that do the entertaining that was what the nickan Spirit was trying to do I don't matter it lets me off the hook whether I'm at the prayer meeting or not whether I'm at church or not whether I this or not I yet God knows my heart I amen that the church is going to go on without me no no no no we are all a body in this worship amen amen so the nician says we'll do it for you amen you guys you guys are too messy with with your worship uh you you you can't we can't have all that shouting and and speaking in tongues and and and you don't have a deep enough understanding of the scripture and so we need a more theological approach uh which will be more appealing to the lost and we're trying to reach the lost we're trying to bring them in so that they can hear the gospel of Salvation and the way you guys are doing it you guys are just looking like a bunch of lunatics and so we're wanting to we're going to get some gu up here that are more polished we'll have our little program and then the lost or the people outside can hear the gospel now that sounds really good but that's not the way God planned it that's right can you say Amen so so brother Bram says they were trying to reach the educated and the oldfashioned gospel was too much for them my so on the uh before we get into the church H book I've got the uh there on the in the church a on the Samaran Church age on tape brother brandom says he had Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors now that's the elected offices of God to his church then in each Church there's nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that is knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing uh workers of Miracles speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues all these things go in each local body and every person in the church has an individual Ministry and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christ can you say Amen so so now nickan ISM as brother as as brother uh Harry mentioned the other night as he as he brought out beautifully now it is men honoring men now it is men uh uh exalting men and and now it's now everyone's jockeying for positions and power and everything else because they want to be h h h uh a part of it and so now we have Bishops and we have uh presor and we have all of these things as we're fixing to read tonight amen now brother the Ephesian age there on tape he says uh he says now what they were trying to do here was trying to take the church where God had the pastors the spirit of God moving by gifts in the Church of the Living God God and they were having a Doctrine start that they was going to have some priests and Bishops and popes and so forth and God says he hated it he hates it yet today niiko overcome overthrow the leoty the leoty is the church how many knows that the leot the church he says overthrow or conqueror take the place of the leoty in other words take all the sacredness all of the power from the church put it over on the priest let the congregation live the way it wants to but the priest is the Holy One take the a holy ghost away from the people sign with signs and wonders following them take a take that away give them a holy priesthood take away the Holy Ghost and swap it for a priesthood can you say Amen now I want you to really open your heart up let's let's look here I'm going to go back um uh we're going to go back a page from from where it's in page 95 uh from where brother Harry stopped the other night now I want you to open your heart up because now I want you to now now now don't don't be looking at this through message filters I want you to take this message and I want you to listen to what brother brandham is saying now when I'm saying message filters I I'm saying brother brandham is telling you and me that we could very well denominate this message we want to hear it Through The Eyes Of God Amen he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear okay now let's let's read here Ephesians or or the U 95 and we're going to start at the second uh paragraph he says Paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would Implement a Implement a way of worship that excluded people from any part of the Holy Spirit Ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the leoty and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from Paul who said that when all come together somebody say all and all had the leading of the spirit somebody say all all and all participated in spiritual worship somebody say all all participated and the church corporate never learned this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time God gives a visitation of the Holy Spirit the people get free and after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of when Luther come out of Catholicism the people stayed free for a while but when he died the people Simply Organized what they thought he believed and set up their own Creeds and ideas and repudiated anyone who said opposite to what they said they went right back to Catholicism with a little different form now now hear me you if you are if you if you followed the the the the true message of Luther they would have never organized if you followed the true message of Wesley brother brandom says if they would have continued with the spirit they would have the message of today sure but they organized and God says amen that's that's that that part of the plant's going to die I'm going to keep going on and Brethren God is coming after a bride that is full of the life of God the Holy Spirit must be in our lives can I hear an amen now watch he says uh he he says uh he says they went right back to the Catholicism with a little different form and right today many Luthers are ready uh to go all the way back and today they have went back amen they've went back joined themselves back to the har uh to the wh Church they have accepted everything about her uh they've done that years ago now and the Pentecostal church has just recently done that now he says oh yes in Revelation 17 the old horde had many daughters these daughters are just like mother they set the word aside deny the work of the spirit of God subjugate the leoty and make it impossible for the leoty to worship God unless uh uh unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from Satan himself so so now he is saying okay so then the messenger's dead he's going on now they are denominating they are organizing around what they think he believed and then they make it impossible for anybody to worship unless they come through the pattern that they set in order can't make a Rapture unless you come through this message what message the message of William brandom was come back to the life that's the message of William brandom not another denomination not another Creed not another you got to do it my way in order to make you've got to know Jesus Christ now what he says um let's see where did I go okay unless you come through my pattern he says oh where oh where are we spiritually we're in a Wilderness of Darkness how far we have wandered from the first church Pentecost is nowhere in View and the word cannot be found now Brothers someone say hallelujah saying we don't believe in the ministry anymore and you need to shut down your churches and put brother brandom in the pull pit subjugating innocent people thousands and thousands and thousands and telling them they can't worship unless they do it the Jeffersonville pattern what did Brother brandom say come on we go back to what the M I don't care I don't care how many foul preachers have taken off denominational wise this way or that way you're in a denomination if you're following Joseph brandham instead of following the word of God you're in a denomination if you're following wendle Martin because if you were following truly following the prophet of the hour it would be causing repentance in our heart and a coming back to every word amen everywhere everyone say everywhere every word what they done is they took they left the most of it but then they were just taking little pieces out until now we can't eat there there ain't there ain't hardly anything that even looks anything even today like like what brother brandham uh what what the angel of the Lord done through brother brandham 50 60 years ago the life of God the Holy Spirit didn't die with brother brandham he's still Among Us can you say Amen now he says he says the Pentecost is nowhere in view the word cannot be found Apostolic secession which today abounds what is Apostolic secession that means that means it's just passed down it's a hierarchy Amen brother brandham is is now now it'll go to his son and they'll go to his son or it would be it would be the same as as as as uh I'm I'm pastor and now now my my son will have to be pastor and and then his son will have to be that's not the way the Holy Spirit works it God chooses who he will that's right and what we've got to do we've got to respect I've got to respect you you got to respect me but we obey the scripture now if God chooses to use one of my sons uh you know that's wonderful but but that's not the way it works God calls God ordains God puts into office that's why we get into so much trouble we we got a we got a powerful leader and then and then it's just got to and and we find come on we see we're seeing that in the UPC that I mean the it's an Apostolic uh uh succession whether the guy's anointed to be Pastor or not or whether the guy can preach a lick you know his dad built the thing up until you know they got a th pie people and so so now it's it's his you know and charismatic guys are all doing the same thing it's a business this is not a business this is God running his church amen all right well can you say Amen now Apostolic secession which today abounds is not found in the word it's a man-made device it supersedes illegally the truth that God not man has set his leaders in the church Peter was not even in Rome yet they lie and say he was history proves he was not they are people who read history they shrug their shoulders and go back to believing a lie where can you find the viker of Christ in the word no one no one takes his place yet it has been done and people accept it and where can you find add that added Revelation is accepted by God especially Revelation contrary to the one already given yet they accept it and rest on it where where do do you find Purgatory where do you find aass where do you find paying money to get out of hell it is not in the word people put it in their own book and by it look over the people ruling them by fear where do you find that man or where do you find that man has the power to forgive us as though he were God Grievious wolves is hardly strong enough to describe them nicod leonism organization man over man get back to God repent before it's too late see the handwriting on the wall it is it is writing judgment as sacred vessels were desecrated and thus brought the wrath of God now the sacred word has been desecrated and the spirit grieved judgment is here even at the door repent repent go back to Pentecost go back to the leadership of the Holy Ghost back to the word of God for why will ye die can you say Amen now now brother Brandon would go on and and um in he in he the Revelations 2 and 7 he that hath in hear Let Him hear what the spirit sath to the churches he says now he says uh it may be that Millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear someone say hallelujah and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of God enlightening him if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you now that is a work of the spirit I can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it you won't get the Revelation now notice it says the spirit is speaking to the churches this is plur that is plural not singular the spirit did not have John write this down to a local Ephesian Church nor for the first church age only it it is for all Church ages but this is the Church of Beginnings thus is like the book of be of Genesis what started in Genesis holds true now K keep this in your mind holds true throughout the entire word finally closes out in Revelation thus this church beginning in Acts is God's blueprint for all ages until she closes out in the lay Odyssey and age watch it carefully let every age take heed for what is going on here is only the start the little tree that was planted is going to grow it's going to grow Through the Ages this then is a message for every Christian through every age until Jesus comes yes it is for it is the spirit speaking amen can you say Amen to that now amen so so we can we can see that amen he wants to make himself real it must take the Holy Spirit amen now now in in the in the sard sardian church age in um um I I don't have the page number there it's in it's in paragraph 77 though it says make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way not part of the way amen all the way somebody say all the way the there's a song we used to sing all the way amen and that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost now amen so so we so we can understand that and that that just sort of goes uh just goes back to uh just wanted to go back a little ways from what brother Harry was mentioning the other night now let's go to page 93 uh for a moment and uh I want to also look here this is going going to be in this first paragraph halfway through it amen it says I believe in leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I also um I I believe see come hold through the word I I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge and by but by uh but that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and the spirit are one Hebrews 13:7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering uh their conversation but see what is happening back there the false find was getting a hold and it was teaching that Ruth ership by men was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it God's way they simply took authority vested all the spiritual power in their own hands came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went right back to the old ironic system and the Antichrist meteor Antichrist his mediatorship imposed their own he says God hated that the Ephesians hated that and any True Believer will hate that too we would have to be Stone blind not to see the same thing at work throughout all Through the Ages and right now it is worse of all what it was was organization they separated the people God's people uh are supposed to be one by one Spirit are they all baptized into one body everyone is to be moved by the spirit Holy Ghost everyone is to participate in worship of God but men wanted the preeminence so they took over control Bishops became archbishops with imposing titles and bypassed the word of God and taught their own doctrines they got the people obey them until the time that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days of Pentecost all right now okay having said that now I want us to look at this because um I I want us to deal now W with this with with this next uh for the next few minutes so what do we do with okay so if men is not supposed to um lead the church then then what are there is a leadership in the church amen God God has placed those that leadership in the church and because remember and this is this is something that that we need that we've got to remember now God always and I'll just read it to you uh this is in perseverant there in in 64 uh he said he was he he looked on the Harvest he was the lord of the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe labors are few pray ye the lord of the Harvest that he may send labors into the Harvest making himself with man so bound together that he works only through the agency of men he could have chose or he chose man to work for him he could have chose the sun to preach the gospel he could have chose the winds or the trees the stars but he chose man veils himself inside he hides himself can you say Amen so another place he says we are only transmitters that transmits the voice of God through our agency of man to the hearer he would also say I believe one of the hardest things that God has ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another mortal we won't believe one another and we are God's agency we know that he he says in another place the hardest thing God has ever had to do is to get one more to believe he says it would be easy if the angel that spoke to me was standing up here on the pull pit tonight and telling you this he said it would be much easier for the angel but he has to come uh he says he said why you would run up and worship him you would want to fall down to his feet but he uses the agency of man that's right can you say Amen now here we're getting back to what the spirit is trying to say it's not a few gifted men or men a hierarchy and and the church is entertained no he uses man every one of us have a Ministry can you say Amen now I want us to go to page uh 197 and and brother brandom's going to um he's he's going to deal here and and I understand that this here is is um this is just the uh the beginning so we're going to be dealing with the nicians all through these Church ages um but but here he explains it pretty good and I I thought we would we would bring this in 197 uh any any questions all right Hallelujah let's see [Music] uh okay so we will we will start there uh we it's got the scripture there in 215 Revelations but we're just going to go on down says you will recall that I brought out in the inisan church age that the word nicotin comes from two Greek words it says noika noiko which means to conquer Leo means the Ley letin means to conquer the leoty that now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindness he has placed his church in the care of God ordained spirit filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word so how does God's H how do any of leadership whether it's in our families whether it's in the church wherever we're at it's all the man by feeding the people can you say you man feeding them the word he has not separated the people into classes so that masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must the whole congregation further there is no place in the word where priest or ministers are such mediate between God and the people am I reading too fast are we okay uh uh through through the people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord God wants all to love and serve him together nickan ISM destroys those precepts instead separates the ministers from the people and makes them leaders overlords instead of servants now this Doctrine usually actually started as a deed in the first church age or the first age it appears that the problem lay in the two words Elders presor overseers Bishops though scripture shows that there are several Elders in each Church some began Ignatius among them to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of uh preeminence or authority and control over the elders so now brother random is is fixing to show us how this started so so here we had the bishop over one Bishop over many elders and there's a lot of that nonsense goes on in some of the ranks in in our message too where there's one over many and and even it even send their tithes into that one and then he distributes the money wherever that is that is that is denomination if there is ever been a denomination that's the truth now watch he says he says now the truth of the matter is the word Elder signifies who the person is while the word Bishop signifies the office of the same man the Elder is the man the bishop is the office of the man Elder always has and always will refer simply to a man's Chron chronological age in the Lord he's an elder not because he's elected or ordained Etc but because he's older he is more seasoned trained not a novice reliable because of experience and long-standing proof of his Christian experience but no the Bishops did not stick to the Epistles of of Paul but rather went to uh went to Paul's account of the time he called the elders from Ephesus uh to um from alphus to ma malius meletus whatever in acts in Acts 20 and and he says and in verse 17 the record States Elders were called men then in verse 28 they were called o overseers Bishops these Bishops no doubt politically minded and anxious for power insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than local Elder with the official capacity only in his own church to make to them a bishop was now one that with extended authority over many local leaders such a a concept was neither scriptural nor historical yet even a man of the stature of polycarp leaned toward such organization thus that which started as a deed in the first age was made a literal Doctrine and so it is today Bishops still claim power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them um where they so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work there unto I've called them this is anti- word and Antichrist Matthew 20:25 but Jesus called unto them and he said ye know the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them that uh they they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but who whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many Matthew 23 and8 but be ye not called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ all ye are Brethren call no man uh call no man your father upon Earth for one is your father which is is in heaven can you say Amen so so now how many's how many's understanding so now what they were trying to do it was in they're taking that that they're in the book of Acts where he called the elders together and so they're they're looking at the Bishops but it was God has many Elders in one congregation there's many Elders now there's one Bishop he's an elder too but he is he is is the pastor of that local congregation he has no author I have no Authority uh uh over o o over amarilla no authority over Bartlesville uh Claremore or anything God places a a a a pastor over the people o over that local church in that church are are Elders amen and and so and and and there could be uh yeah and and they're deacons they they're ministers there's and there's and there's some that might not even have have a an official position but men that are that that are great in our church that have weathered the storms my they don't they don't have the title of Pastor but that don't make them any less than what the pastor is or they might not have the title of evangelist but that don't make them any less we are all one and equal in the call of God or in the in the family of God each of us have different calls can you say Amen now so so you can see that it was that it's politics plain and simple so now well brother Wendell if if if brother brandom is saying that we don't have we don't we don't have leadership anymore and that now and and and and there's a lot of there's a lot of you know again I I I don't I don't like picking on our own on our on our own um in the message but listen you got to do it the way brother Brenham the the the life the the the angel of the lord gave brother Brenham to give it to us he's not going to take away from the scripture he's not going to do that so to say we don't need a minister we don't need a we don't need a pastor we don't need a church we don't need where where where can you even remotely find that in the in the message see and then makes then then it makes the others look at us and call us occult well we're not the occult because we can take everything back to the Bible the prophet brought us back to the Bible now what other men make of it well whatever they make of it but it's not way the prophet brought it now in the bylaws let's just look let's just look here in the bylaws uh there in in um uh well this this just the uh the bylaws on on the pastor it says the office of the pastor is to conduct and act upon any program that he believes is to be according to the plan of God according to the word of God for the brandham Tabernacle he shall assume supreme authority to meet the initial responsibility of solely as to the keeping and promoting of the spiritual welfare of the church he shall be the head of the associate pastor the Deacon board the trustee board and the church body itself acting in wisdom to lead God's Saints manifesting love toward All Saints and their burdens conducting himself in perfect servitude of which God has called and placed him to act upon now you say oh no two totally opposites no no it's the way God put it and ordained it it's not meant I can't promote man you can't promote man God gives those calls right amen now questions and answers he says we believe in church government the government is ordered of the holy spirit in the Bible the pastor is always the head of the church pastor is always that's God's Elder in organizations they come through the bishop and now and there's no higher order in the Bible than the Elder uh in the church just just tell me where it's at there's no higher order in the Bible for the church than that Elder which is the pastor he's the highest order another place he says the pastor must be a man that's got a h a very humble Spirit way about him not too humble but what he he could be like the Lord Jesus when he saw wrong going on in the church and he plated ropes and ran them out of the church now the Church of God is the highest of judgment the pastor is the highest order in the church the Elder is the highest thing in the apostolic church outside the Holy Spirit the spirit brings his message straight to that Elder and the Elder gives it to the people so it's not taking away from Le leadership it is men usurping men tagging men men tagging men and making them and and and it's and it's a hierarchy but God has given God has given uh Shepherds God has given servants to feed his people not lead according to his every whim no that if he's a true pastor and we're fixing to get into to to to the other ministers as well but if he is a true Pastor he will never lead the people to himself he will always lead the people back to this and that's what we want so so but people Buck they what it is and and this is this is this is tough but people display the seed of the serpent they want to Buck Authority when God is working through that leadership and we've got to be careful that we're not dis we got to be care we got to make sure we've got the Holy Ghost yes sir because the Holy Ghost brother bradam says the Holy Ghost will subject to the Holy Ghost amen can you say Amen now now he says here he says now he says there's coming a church into that Perfection the ministry of perfection where the offices Apostles prophets teachers p pastors evangelist for the perfecting of the Saints then pastors and teachers so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord amen so uh so you know so he he he he he he begins to talk on this amen so he's not doing a away with leadership leadership is here but the leaders that God places must be so Walking with God and communicating with God that they can hear his message not not their own message but hear his message and that's for the five-fold ministry that's for that's for every that's for those five Divine gifts just as the nine spiritual gifts those guys have got to hear from God and not just say you know thus sayith the Lord the lord loves you and all well the Bible says that so brother brand says that's vain repetition it's got to be from the Lord and that's the reason why man it's such a it's such a an incredible thing be the Lord God the Holy Spirit wants to move among his people he wants us all in one order y y'all understand any questions real quick amen any anything at all or anyone wants to add anything you're welcome to do so too amen brother Brenham even says that the that the Evangelist is subject to the pastor they go to so we hear we we hear um evangelist coming in boy I straighten that Pastor out the prophet said you're not you can't do that that's right because you're coming you well he don't have enough truth well go talk to him go talk to him by himself if you've got something you want to share with him but you don't go in and so confusion you you have to honor the way God set it up and the Evangel is not the leader of the church so we we so we we we keep the confusion away if God gives you something well then by all means you have to go and and and tell and and and tell that elder or whoever and say hey the lord gave me this you know I remember when I was selling shoes and and I well I was at the time I was doing Sonics and um so we were running all over Oklahoma you know doing those Sonics and I got a phone call and uh and the brother says I am grieved he said my heart is so grieved I I I'm I'm shaken right now as I call you and I said well he said the spirit of the Lord says he is grieved that you would put money and prosperity before your ministry well first thing happens to me is I'm who are you to be telling me but then the spirit of the Holy Ghost within me had to look at that because actually there was already conviction already taking place in my heart and I was I was out there after the well praise the Lord and it's hard it's been hard that's one one of the hardest things for me as a working Pastor you know trying to find that balance and I said what it's easy for you to say you've got money in the bank I don't I I I don't have a church you're and it was a pastor I said you you I have to work he says all I can tell you is what the spirit of the Lord told me click I had to subject myself to that word I had to repent amen now so God's got leadership God knows how to work now I don't know I can't tell you why you know why some some pastors are you know poor as all get out and some amen uh uh got they they've got enough money to build every everything and to satisfy all of their wants of of everything in their Church I I'm not a bit jealous they've got the money God bless them do it if I had the money I'd probably do it too amen I I I want our congregation to be blessed I want I want those things but ultimately I'm responsible to God not for my wants not to build a kingdom I'm not to build a kingdom I am to feed the sheep that God places under my tutelage that's right that's what I'm for I can't do anything else and I will be held accountable before God that's right amen now so let's move on I want to uh and I want us to just look for a moment at the deacons at the deacons because these are deacons trustees pastors uh the the fivefold ministry the the these are all areas and some people look at these things and says well I don't have to listen to the Deacon or I don't have to listen what the prophet said you did that is Holy Ghost leadership and we get we get angry with God or we get angry with this one or we tell this one off and we tell what what are you doing what what are you doing do we not fear God do we not understand that God's Got God's got a church this is his church and he's wanting your heart to be in line with his Spirit just as much as he's wanting the preacher's heart to be in line with the spirit that's right we must have the life of God within us so what we what we would say well that's nickel adism that's not nickel adism if it's to God that I just read you the guidelines on what brother randam had said on the on the pastor and and uh and I've also got it here for the Deacon and you'll understand that brother Brandon was saying these are men trying to usurp their opinion and trying to build Their Kingdoms and let the people die without without the power of God in their lives but it's not just the preachers that do it daddies do it you've got your own little kingdom and it don't care what the Bible says it don't care you don't care what the message says you're the boss of your little kingdom and you are under the authority of nickan ism you're Conquering the spirit of God the life of God that would be in your family of what you could what what could possess them and fill them and make Servants of them that's we got to be careful can you say Amen now now I want to start I thought this was an interesting quote he says brother bram's question answer 64 he says there's five offices elected of God he says for God has said in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists God did that he says man has deacons and so forth I thought that was I I thought that was in incredibly now God sets the God sets the five-fold ministry and then he says and man has deacons and so forth and and um um he says uh well praise the Lord I'm I'm missing I I'm missing that uh but brother brandom says and God honored it and I I I I I I don't I don't see it here but where he talks about he said now and he and he takes back to the first deacons how that you know he said we've got to remain there in Acts the sixth chapter we've got to remain in the word and there was there was there was uh um the widows that weren't being taken care of the Greeks weren't being taken this that and the other and and so brother Brandon says so now God uh so they the they looked and said look out seven seven men of reputation and and he says and then God honored that and then put put by bylaws for the deacons and then he and then he says in in in several in in several places um he he says a Deacon's got more responsibility than the pastor has he says he's to be blameless a deacon is and and so uh another place it says GI and callings gets and callings let it let's let's get back uh what they what they are God sets them aside God places them in the church as he will God gives severally as he will is that right not as I will but as he will now if God wanted me to be a lay member of the church I'd be better off a lay member than I would to be a preacher because I will only bring reproach anywhere along the line it'll be something that'll bring uh that that'll bring reproach if he called me to be a be Deacon it's better for me to be a deacon than it would be a de Minister but if he's called me to be a minister I'd be better off a minister than I would be a lan member it's whatever God has called us to set us and set us in the church for his servants then we fit better so now he's he's coming back saying wherever he places you it is God that is doing the placing it's the Holy Spirit now are you understanding that it is not just a slack here it is to be working in that church there in 1 Corinthians 7:7 it says but for I would that all men were even as myself but every man has his proper gift of God one after this manner one after that can you say Amen so because of the needs they they were they were to bring it in now um uh and I'm going to he says it it's it it isn't the pastor's duty to look out for the food and so forth that's supposed to be by the deacons it isn't the trustees it's the Deacon's office to do that remember in the Bible they was was contributing to their own the Greeks and the Jewish and where where the argument came up and that one that one was getting a little more than the other but it was the people who had sold all their goods and had give it to the church for its support and then divided among them equally and there was that little dispute there's where we got our first deacons and that was one of their uh duties was to do that um in church order 63 he says now the Deacon is a policeman a Deacon's office is actually more strict than any office in the church I don't know of any office any more strict than the Deacon's office that's right he's got a real job and he's God's man he's he's God's man just as much as the pastor is God's man certainly he is God's uh he's God's servant there in hiding himself in Simplicity when brother bradam is dedicating the Tabernacle before the seals he says please let every Deacon stand to his post of Duty and remember that you're under a commission from God to hold that post sacred and every trustee the same now he he goes on he says now the deacons they are the policemen of the church this is this is still this in the seals he says that is if young couples come on the outside and blowing horns and you know you know how they usually do and something like that in the meetings or you know get out there and their mother is sending her her girl down here and she takes out with a renegade kid and runs out there in the car and her mother think she's in church the Deacon ought to see to that you either come in here and sit down or I'm going to take you in my car and take you to your mother he says You must do that remember love is corrective always love is corrective genuine love so you must be able to stand correction and mothers know now that there's a place there for your babies and your kids now that they don't run around all over the building he goes on but but what he's what he's saying is okay in church out Church God's God's got God's got deacons that that are there we don't want no one ran over we don't want no one speeding in our parking lot we don't want gravel being spun out everywhere we don't we don't want them running up and down the the God's given us deacons to say that that's right so if if I have a problem with a deacon getting on to one of my children or getting on uh uh uh my grandchildren I have I now I'm not saying disciplining them I'm not saying that's the parents job but the thing is if there is somebody outside there don't you I mean and a and and a and going out there in the back of the you know going behind a car well a deacon a you you a deacon needs to hey hey and that that family and those children needs to know that Deacon has Authority that that's God's leadership that's God's leadership you know and then we just what no one better get on to my children you're a doofus come on let the spirit of the Lord come on you and see what the prophet is telling us he says the children should know discipline they should get it at home but even if it's mine my kids get in here at any time and they get disorderly I don't want to just draw One String Sarah Rebecca Joseph Billy whoever it might be can you say Amen he's not going to he's not going to hold anything back he says you tell me I'll see to it and if they can't behave they'll stay away from church until they learn to behave that is not an arena this is the house of God this is a not a place to play skate write notes laugh cut up in in the house of God to be carried on you come here to worship not even a place to visit or not not even to visit this is a not a picnic ground uh this is not a visitation place this is the visitation place of the Holy Spirit listen to what he has to say not to one another we don't come here to fellowship with one another we come here to fellowship with Christ this is the house and if these parents of the children want not listen to that then the deacons then that's this parrot should be corrected themselves can you say Amen so so again it's not you know we but what what I'm what I'm trying what what I'm trying to say here in this in this in in this area is we got to understand that God places leadership God places this leadership to keep us all safe now again Deacon's got the same he's got the same got to have the same same qualifications that the pastor does any kind of a leadership's got to have those same qualifications you know uh uh uh uh you got to be got to be humble and and things of that nature there can you say amen he says now God's not sent brother Neville and I to be bosses not at all we're your brothers you see instructions instructors in the gospel so let us all work together sometimes if something operates operating has to be called or said something about called down something in that order the person that's got the gift rejects it in other words the other person they're talking to just remember and if he refuses it remember your gift isn't right it wasn't God in the first place the spirit of God is ready for correction sweet and humble willing see if it stands up and says well I'll do it anyway you know how sometime you know how sometimes just remember arrogant Spirits are not of God deacons were asking brother Brandon one in respect to to the to the order of the church we have tried to go according to the way we understood it given in the dedication of the new church he said that's correct you're doing right now this is supposed to be the deacons he says and by doing so people has often gotten mad at us he says they do me too they'll do that at any man see a person that does that there's something wrong with that person they're not right with God for the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ's teaching Christ's house Christ order see any man any woman any person children that would get angry with a Godly Deacon that would tell them or any parent would get angry with a deacon really we want everyone in this church that we can get but if that would only cause trouble somewhere else there's a thorn or a rabbit in the wood pile as we used to say that person isn't right can you say Amen so so when we when we look leadership is part of it but a lot of people bring that as a hierarchy saying huh well that's just no no this is what the prophet taught on Holy Ghost leadership should be that's right so when we're looking when we're going and and we're you know as we as we go further and we're fixing to get into that uh as we go on brother Brandon's going to really start dealing how that it's sucks the life out of the church sucks that life out of the church and so we don't want that life sucked out of the church can you say amen and and and brother bradam would bring these the these deals in you know he would even separate and now the trustee is over the finances and things of the building they have nothing to do with the deacons the deacons are the policemen of the church the the assistance to the pastor the the trustees is the holding of the property the the trustees has nothing to do with the spiritual end of it the Deacon has nothing to do with the financial end of it and and and he says now the trustees the only thing they're under the duty by God somebody say Duty by God Duty by God to watch the finances and take care of that the thing that goes on like that I told you about them tapes and and about the other things here about the building and repairs and taking up and the finances and things that that's that's what they truste of the property and things he says uh the deacons has nothing to do in that neither does the trustee have anything to do with the Deacon's office and so so it is so here so what I what what reason I thought I would bring this in tonight and and we've not read just a whole bunch out of the church age book but before we go into this next section uh the next the next time's going to be the the two trees in the garden and that's that's going to be a wonderful I can't wait to get on that amen and U but to to say that well we don't we don't have we don't have to have Authority or we don't we don't have to have no no no no no God's got God ordained leadership in the church amen he does he's got that now I and I want to even say that on on on on on work days for the trustee if he's trying to organize put teams together and things like that we should rally brother random says he is commissioned by God so we should rally around you say well that's just all natural that's just bu no you you you you you you're missing the point it takes us all God's not all of you can preach not all of you can play music you're not gifted that but you do have some hands and a foot and a and a and a strong back you can do something for the Lord he said the trustees are not over the spiritual aspect at all and yet they're commissioned by God God so the Holy Spirit has ordained that the natural well we got the we got the Youth Camp coming up well everything you do you are you are you are you are rallying around what God is doing can you say amen amen now uh one more quote here and he says um he says uh he says now the group of officers of our church and deacons trustees Sunday School uh superintendent Pastor our church set in order you people elected the officers I I um uh I'm and Pastor I I'm let's see I'm just overseer to see that it goes on right to give advice and so forth you are the one who elects now I want you to understand that you are the one and he and he goes and he goes on down he says it's your duty to stand by those men they'll make mistake they're Mortals they're just men they'll make mistakes but if the president of the United States makes a mistake we do we throw him out as a president we forget about it and move on or he said no we forget about it and move on that's the way we want to do our church remember it's the and on down he says remember it's the devil's business to see that it's broke up that's uh it's always been that way it always will be but stand by your officers can you say Amen so so as we as as we as as we get ready to close here now the when we see what God has has um has called us to there is one thing that brother brandom is is is really stressing amen he is stressing keeping the life in the church now you say well brother wend that's a lot of carnal things yes it is and that's the reason why we must always there's a balance we've got to take because we're not turning this thing into a money machine we're not turning this thing into a but we are simply taking care of what we've got we are taking care deacons got their job to take that care of the Holy Spirit preachers are to hear from God to to to to feed the people moing the lawn we're doing we're taking care of what we've got and in doing so you mothers are the officer of God to your children you husbands are the officer of God to your to your families you're you're you and and and but the husband ain't ain't ain't free to just do everything he wants he's got to line it up right here Mama's got to line it up right here you children's got to line it up right here pastors got to line it up right here we've all got to line it up with thus sayith the lord well praise the Lord all right amen we're going to open the floor again if you've got if you've got anything you want to you want to say any questions anything you want to add praise the Lord yeah care yeah well you know that's tough I you know mama mama bears and her Cubs you know Hallelujah you know but Mama bears need the Holy Ghost too if they've got the Holy Ghost they they've got that's why that's that's that's that's why the deacons got it rough Hallelujah they they do and and so we uh uh but but the thing is is that's that's that's what we've got to have in order to keep the life of God and and I think I think most most mamas if deacons are fair and they're not you know taking up for their own children or they're not you know this that and the other I mean you know it's being a being a being a minister period a minister um and and a deacon you know you you you've got to judge you got to judge fairly you can't you can't you can't and and I think if the congregation knows then that that gives that gives them a um a little more credibility you know amen anyone else well I know this wasn't the way that you planned on this going here tonight and um but brother brother Harry had given the the other on on on how that you know I I like the way he well we're all going to play a tape at a certain time time you know we're going to everyone has to everyone has to get on the the internet and do it this way that is usurping Authority Beyond now I have no problem I I have no problem listening to the tape of the day the quote of the day I have no problem with that but but but someone saying you've got to come under this order and this is the way it's got to be I think that's what brother Harry used the other night on it and that becomes our spirituality as long as as long as we're f following you know what what Jeffersonville is telling us to do then you know I think we should listen to tapes every day not just not just one day out of the week myself I think we need to and I don't think we just need to be reading just the quote of the day I think we need to get into the message and listen to the message that's right and I think if there were more of us listening to the message we wouldn't be following blindly with a lot of this other stuff and saying well uh they don't listen to the message too much A lot of these in order to follow it don't take too much to know you know when when the Thunder group was was whining and dining me and trying to get me to go I mean it hey it was attractive the Thunder group was attractive I mean they had actionpack Services I mean people were I mean I'm thinking Whoa man all right I can do this Hallelujah and and you hearing the message oh yes and wow and so but then after I begin to hear what they've gotten I thought well that I don't remember brother brandom putting it quite that way and nah brother brandom didn't say that and so then I'd go I say okay all right give me your quotes give me your quotes they gave me 50 pages of quotes and so I'm reading all these quotes and then I seen some were spliced in this and the other and I'm going no thank you no thank you that's not what I want huh take it like he said take it like he said that's right amen all right anyone else praise the Lord these young people are always so good in church I just I appreciate you you young people amen that's sure we do love my kiddos amen praise the Lord all right uh uh nothing nothing else to be added praise the name name of Jesus I want this worship I want God don't ever take that worship away from me don't let the Antichrist let me fill my place F if you if you think that you just all you do is go to church and just a few a few Services a day and
