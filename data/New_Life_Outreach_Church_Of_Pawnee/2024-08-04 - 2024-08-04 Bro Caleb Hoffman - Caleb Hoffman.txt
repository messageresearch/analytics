[Applause] amen you believe that this morning amen I'm so glad I serve a God that he's still there when you need him amen God bless yall this morning if you would stand your feet and we can't open up our Bibles we're going to begin in the Book of Genesis the fourth chapter in the 8th verse and then from there we're going to go to the book of Hebrews the 12th chapter beginning in the 23rd verse Lord Genesis the 4th chapter and verse 8 it says and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass that when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said un Cain where is able thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cth unto me from the ground now notice Abel didn't speak but it was the blood that spoke in in Hebrews the 12th chapter beginning in the 23rd verse it would read to the general assembly and to the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirit of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling and that word sprinkling there in the Hebrew would mean purification and to the blood of purification that speaketh better things than that of Abel brother Brandon would tell us many times that the blood of Christ speaks better things than that of Abel if I can I like take for a title this morning when the blood speaks okay before we go to the Lord in prayer I'd like to read this quote real quick where the prophet he said see Abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation that he had had he spoke and it cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out but it redeemed amen it speaketh better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide can but the blood of Jesus can amen let's bow our heads this morning dear father Lord we come before you we lord we humbly and graciously come before you we thank you for giving us this opportunity to be here father together with Saints of like Precious faith and father Lord to be able to praise and be able to worship Lord in the name of Jesus Christ father Lord we thank you Father Lord and as we begin to Lord change the order of the service and go into the word I ask that you would just move this broken vessel aside and that you would just use me and that your word would come forth father Lord your unadulterated word would just speak through me and that you would Lord come and just meet the needs of the people father you know every need you know every heart you know every soul you know what they have need of and we're putting this service into thy hands you know all the needs father Lord that were put before the desk I ask you would just come and meet those father through is moving a mighty way today we put the service to your hands in the name of Jesus we pray amen be seated praise the Lord So In this passage of scripture here we're reading here in Genesis in 4:10 it says the voice of thy brother's blood cth unto me from the ground we know we understand that this scripture is the first time in history that the blood of man was ever shed it's the first time that the blood of Adam was ever spilled upon the ground and the prophet of God would tell us that blood has a voice blood always speaks when you begin to study probably the most universal fact that we know about blood something that Humanity has known about blood long before we ever knew anything else is that blood is essential for life and not only that but blood is one of the most complex and enriched substances that exist upon the face of the earth when you uh when you go to study it from a medical standpoint doctors they can examine an individual's blood and I'm sure just about everybody in here at some point in their life has been to the doctor and they've had they've had blood drawn and a doctor can examine an individual's blood and they can determine based on the type and the makeup of that blood they can determine the condition of the body that that blood was coursing through because all the power and all the nutrients and all the vitamins and all the strength and all the life that is contained in that body is contained inside of that blood and is distributed throughout the body through that blood in the courtroom anyone who knows are familiar with this setting knows that the blood speaks volumes the blood speaks louder than any witness the blood speaks louder than any other piece of evidence the witness could be Witnesses could be stacked up against somebody the evidence could be stacked up against somebody but when the blood test comes back when the blood results come back whatever the blood says it settles the case because the blood doesn't lie but the blood always speaks the truth and since 1989 DNA blood testing became available for the first time and since then 575 cases in the us alone have been overturned we're talking about convicted felons people who have spent over 20 years locked away in prison people have spent more than half their life some of them they've been locked away in bondage but we entered into an age change where the Revelation was revealed that that blood contained an identification property and that blood could identify who you were and it could speak for you when nobody else would and I just want to tell y'all this morning that there is an identifying bud that's going to speak for you when nobody else would amen we see in reading this verse it says the voice of thy brother's blood and you'll notice if you dive into the scripture that word voice there in the Hebrew doesn't mean a whisper it doesn't mean a quiet or a gentle sound but that word there in the strong concordance actually means a thundering Proclamation a loud cry a scream or a yell a thunder a sound and lastly that word voice here means an absolute the voice of to the blood is absolute it's an absolute voice it's an absolute sound and we know what an absolute means if something's absolute it means it's positive it's unquestionable it's undeniable it's irrevocable truth it's Undisputed so the blood can speak boldly it can speak clearly it can speak sharply because it is that has the voice of an absolute you ain't got to worry about whether the blood's going to lie you ain't got to worry about whether it's true or whether it's false you ain't got to worry about whether it's going to go to the left or whether it's going to go to the right but when the blood speaks is the voice of an absolute is the sound of an absolute and brother Bron would tell us in the Old Testament the blood represented sin and death all throughout the Old Testament the blood spoke of sin and it spoke of Sorrow it spoke of death it spoke of shame it spoke of the fall of mankind and today we see that the blood still speaks the blood never the blood never got quiet the blood never lost his voice what has changed is the message that the blood is speaking the prophet of God will say the blood now it speaks better things the blood of the second Adam speaks better things than the blood of the first Adam and for the first e that blood represented her fall that blood represented her shame that blood represent her mistake the blood represented the fall of mankind oh but there is another re that has rose up today that she will not turn down what the God has given her she will not but she will accept what the first Eve turned down because the blood no longer speaks against her but the blood now it speaks for her and I just want to say this morning the blood speaks for you amen the prophet said there goes the second Adam one brought death and here goes one bringing life here's the one who took life out of the world and here's the one who's bringing life back into the world the second Adam with his own blood hitting against his legs like that the Son of God going into Calvary to bear away our sins y that through the shedding of blood to perfect a man or a woman unconditionally I thought it was so powerful the contrast here of what the blood is speaking the blood now speaks better things and no longer speaks death and no longer speaks Justice and no longer speaks Vengeance but it now speaks power and now speaks restoration and now speaks Grace it speaks Mercy it speaks adoption it speaks Perfection it speaks for a bride that couldn't speak for herself is it spoke for a people that could not speak for themselves it doesn't only speak all these things but it speaks these things for you church maybe all the evidence is stacked up against you this morning maybe all the evidence is piled up against you maybe there's charge after charge piled up against you maybe he has penalty after penalty piled up against you maybe all the witnesses are piled up against you maybe all the evidence is piled up against you oh but no matter how many witnesses he has that say you're guilty no matter how much evidence he says that says you're guilty when the blood speaks when the blood is called to the stand the blood says you're free the blood says you're innocent the blood says I have paid the price the blood says I have paid the sacrifice the blood said I have bought you the blood said I bought Caleb the blood says I bought you and the blood says your bride the blood says your M oh I don't care how much evidence there is I don't care how many witnesses there is I don't care how strong the case of the prosecution is when the blood sea speaks it settles the case because the voice of the blood overcomes the voice of the prosecution the voice of the blood overcomes the voice of the enemy the voice of the blood overcomes the voice that says you're guilty it overcame the voice that said you've gone too far it overcame the voice that said there's no going back it overcame the voice that said you can never overcome it overcame that voice but there was another voice that rose up and it said I bought Caleb it said I bought brother Duren it said I bought Zion it said I bought brother wendle it says I have bought them with a price and I don't care what you say and I don't care what you say another voice from another the world I spoke up for them and that voice says they're free that voice is a sound of Freedom it's a sound of Deliverance it's a sound of Victory and that voice says I have paid their price oh when the blood speaks every other voice gets quiet when the blood speaks no other voice can can speak over it cuz when the blood speaks oh it's such an absolute it's a voice of an absolute the evidence speaks guilty the case say prison or the penalty speak death the prosecution speaks bondage but the blood speaks ictory the blood speaks Freedom the blood says you ain't got to live in that condition no more the blood says you ain't got to live under condemnation the blood says you can have forgiveness the blood says you can have your healing the blood says you can have your Redemption the blood says there's still enough for you Caleb there's still a drop of blood that can be dropped on you there's still enough there for you oh and if you're ever confused about what voice to listen to the evidence can lie the witnesses can lie oh the fast can lie the evidence can be forged the witnesses can be F paid off the facts can be Ted with but there was a blood flowing from emanuel's veins Hallelujah it can't be forced it can't be faked it can't be tampered with it can't be oh Hallelujah it can't be imitated it can't be replicated it can't be faked it can't be counterfeited he tried to imitate it he tried to replicate it he tried to fake it oh but there is nothing that compares to the voice of the blood there's nothing that compares to the voice of a word that called out for a bride there's nothing that compares oh hallelujah it's a voice of an absolute the prophet of God would say everything that bothered you back there somebody say everything everything that bothered you back there and hindered your Christian experience died in the blood Hallelujah everything that bothered you back there and hindered your Christian experience it died in the blood he said everything it died in the blood it's gone it's over with your sickness your problems your complexes your past your weakness everything negative about you everything wrong about you

live inside you it came to live through you it came to flow through your veins it came there oh and if I ever forget about it if I ever forget about what he did to me there was a blood that was there to remind me Caleb remember where I brought you from Caleb remember where you were until just one drop of blood fell on you remember your past remember your complex just remember your scars oh until there was a blood that one day came and touched your heart there was a message that came and it touched your heart and there was a sea down on the inside of it and the Deep called into the deep and it said I'm here send me I'm here oh Hallelujah just get in the blood this morning oh it's a voice that'll hold you it's a voice that'll carry you you ain't got to worry about it you ain't got to worry about it's whether it's right you ain't got to worry about whether it's wrong it's been Vindicated time and time and time again it's been Vindicated time and time and time again you ain't got to worry about it church this blood is true this blood is absolute you can get in this message you can get in this blood and it'll carry you all the way oh it's such a sure voice oh I remember a time I will go after this voice and I'll go after that voice I will go voice I the voice I have the voice that voice sounding good so I follow after that voice that voice sounding good so I follow after that voice time and time again over one of these mornings the years of this baby eagle came in contact with a voice it was a voice from another world it was a voice I never heard before oh it was a sounding of Mama Eagle it was a sound of the Jubilee trumpet it was a sounding of a word that called out to a word bride oh church we ain't bunch of chickens in the chicken yard we ain't meant for the chicken yard but we were made to soar among the Eagles we were made to fly with M Eagle we were made to Screech with Mama Eagle we were made to scream with Mama Eagle oh man I heard that voice come and I looked around me where the voices normally come from I looked to my left there wasn't the voice wasn't coming from there I looked to my right the voice wasn't coming to there I walked back to the chicken house The Voice one coming from there over One Direction I had never looked there was another voice it was coming from another world it was coming from another dimension and that voice called out to me and it said Caleb you ain't meant to live in the chicken yard you ain't a chicken you ain't a Pentecostal chicken that just flutters your wings when you get excited but you are an eagle they can spread your wings you can live in Liberty you can fly in Liberty you can fly in Freedom amen oh the Lord it says the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking than the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood and the voice of the blood is the Holy Ghost and that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it he said the voice of the blood is the word and the word is identified by the voice of the blood so here we see again the identification property that is laying down on the inside of this blood and another place here in the token the prophet would say the believer is identified by the blood so the voice of the blood is the word the word for our day is the message of the hour so the voice of the blood is the message of the hour the voice of the blood is the message the voice of the blood is Malachi 4 that is what the voice of the blood is it's the voice of a bride oh church I don't follow after this message oh just because it happened upon it one day and I thought it sounded good oh I don't follow this message because I just heard it one day I heard a preacher say it one day but no that's not why I follow this message when I heard I didn't hear the voice of William brandom I didn't hear the voice of a Kentucky Hill Billy oh I didn't hear the voice of just some good preacher but I heard the voice of the blood I heard the voice of the word I Heard a Voice that was calling out to me the Deep called into the deep the word called and it said Caleb your mind you can run as long as you want to you can just sit there as long as you want to you can live there as long as you want to but one of these days you're going to be done running because I have called you you are mine I have said you're mine I predestin you to be mine so no matter how much you run the bud is going to catch up to you and the Bud's going to get inside of you and the blood is going to move through you oh Hallelujah the voice of the Blood church you can speak the voice of the blood you can let it move through you oh y'all y'all forgive me my voice it gets it gets horse sometimes oh man he would say the blood speaks it speaks a better thing in the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt in the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it speaks of death and of sorrow but in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and of life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of Heaven and the same blood that was shed upon the ground that called out after his dead brother or called out after his brother that killed him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of your sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and just in case he missed anything he said and all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for you all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed forth it speaks for you church you've got healing it's standing there to speak for you you've got freedom it's standing there to speak for you you've got Deliverance it's standing there to speak for you every Redemptive blessing of Calvary the blood will apply it the blood will speak for you oh Hallelujah how do you apply that blood he said and God required a token and this token was an innocent lamb that he had substituted for death in the Garden of Eden and now when the lamb was killed the blood was to be placed upon the doorpost and on the lentil and it was to show that the requirement had been carried out so the prophet he's teaching on this message in the beginning of the sermon you know he he goes through the death was was the price that was required of all Humanity death was required not just of the people in Egypt but that same death was required of the people that were there in Goan oh but he said you ain't got to pay that price the prophet at the beginning of the message would Define a token as a sign that the price has been paid oh and the token was not just the blood but it was the blood applied death would come knocking and the blood will say pass on by the price has been paid death will come knocking for your children and the blood will say pass on by the price has been paid it will come knocking for your family and the blood will say pass on by the price has been paid I'm here to tell you this morning you don't know the devil nothing you don't know death nothing you don't know that sickness nothing you don't know that complex nothing so just tell them devil pass on by the price has been paid pass on by the price has been paid I pay the sacrifice for Caleb I pay the sacrifice for Josh I pay the sacrifice for Kobe pass on my the price has been paid oh he would say the blood tonight is applied by simple Faith just not anything Supernatural but it's right around you everywhere just simply like a child reach out and grab a hold of it and apply the blood he said and this hiss up is just a simple childlike faith for the believer it isn't something out of your reach you don't have to reach very far to get it so the blood was applied through simple faith not some man-made theology not some complicated process not some intellectual system not some denominational organization not some s group of people who came up with a plan of how to get saved oh but no he said it's just applied through symbol faith and the privet would say it's not even Supernatural it's so simple it's not even Supernatural but it'll produce it Supernatural if you apply it but he said that blood was like the hiup and in the sermon he would explain that the hisb it was just it was a weed that would go everywhere throughout Goan it would just go everywhere and he was a perfect type because he said wherever the children of Israel were at whether they were at the mall whether they're at the store whether they're out at work wherever they were at they could just reach down and they could get on their knees and they could just take a hold of the hiss up right there where they were at it wasn't something they had to go to a priest for it wasn't something they had to go to a pope for it wasn't something they had to go to Jeffersonville for they could kneel down where they were at and they could just take up that faith and they could dip it in the blood and they could begin to apply the promises they could wave and begin to apply the promises they can apply the blood and just say get on back devil the blood has been applied get on back devil simple faith has applied the token oh speak for your family don't be afraid to speak for your family don't be afraid to speak for your children don't be afraid to speak for your spouse you can apply it over your household you can just apply the blood and just watch the blood speak for you oh when the death angel came when the death angel came by they didn't have to go out with clubs and stand there and say I'm going to kill you no they didn't have to do that why the Earth angel came and there was the blood and you know what they did they turned around and they walked the other way I tell you if you apply the blood Satan will walk up to you and he'll turn around he'll go the other way cuz he knows who you are he knows that there's been a blood token that's been applied over your life he can't touch you he can't give to you he can't hurt you oh you can accept your healing this morning accept your deliverance oh just step out on the blood just step out in simple faith and say I'm apply on the blood I'm applying the blood oh it's easy church it's not something hard if it was something hard I promise you I can do it but something easy and I was able to do it as a 17y old boy I was able to sit there oh in all my past the things I done the thoughts I'd had the things i' said the way I lived at 16 years old I was an atheist I went to church cuz mama and daddy made me not cuz I wanted to not cuz I felt there was a call in my life no I went cuz Mom and Daddy made me oh at 17 years old oh there was a change that happened inside my heart cuz one day I was running as hard as I could but no matter how hard I was running a drop of blood somehow managed to hit me in the back of the head no matter how much I tried to get away from it no matter how far I Tred to run the drop of blood still hit me oh and when that drop hit me I begin to shout I begin to dance I begin to praise oh I didn't know why at the time but now I know why because I had the word I had the blood of Jesus Christ Mo coursing through my veins oh it's coursing through me so now by this time it's already moved through my body the blood takes 45 seconds to go from your heart all the way around your body to refill itself two million times per second and go back to your heart the whole process the whole refilling process the whole regeneration process takes 45 seconds you know what that means let me paint a little picture for you that means if Satan comes and spends 3 minutes telling you that you're not bride you can say Satan while you were sitting here wasting your time I just got four ref feelings while you were sitting there was in your time that blood is already regenerated oh that blood's already been moving I've already got refilling that's a refilling that's a refilling that's a refilling oh and that blood's refilling me again oh Hallelujah what's that what's that devil I'm not bride give me a second let me dance a little bit I'll get back to you cuz I just got another refilling what's that devil I can't overcome okay give me a second let me just shout a little bit oh cuz I just got another refilling oh church if you just let that blood course through you move through you let the message move through you oh it'll take away all the hurt it'll take away all the problems and it'll refill you and refill you it won't just last you a day it won't just last you a month oh but it'll last you an eternity oh hallelujah amen oh you can speak the blood the prophet of God said you the Bride of Jesus Christ now has thus sayth the Lord you have thus sayth the Lord okay I don't mean to sound sacrilegious but you ain't got to wait for a prophet to do it you ain't got to wait for a preacher to do it you ain't got to wait for your pastor to pray for you you ain't got to wait you can do it he said you can speak it brother Brandon was making analogy and he was kind of mocking the people and he was sitting there and he said oh well I'll just wait till the big name preacher gets to town he'll say you sister have the same Authority the same power the same strength as that big name preacher has he said you can claim healing just as much as he can you can claim Authority just as much as he can you can claim Deliverance just as much as he can I'm here to tell you this morning you can claim it you can claim the blood you can speak the blood you can speak the message if you're sick this morning is the morning to claim your healing if you've been in a battle this morning is the morning to claim your Victory oh if you've been in a fight if you've been under bondage this morning is the morning to claim your freedom amen many of you know Zan's uh story in her battle with eczema some of y'all do but I just want to go through this testimony it's so powerful and ties into this thought so well but Zion for anybody that doesn't know about Eczema it's a skin condition it's a skin disease Z has she's battled with this and I guess she she was just a little girl and skin disease all your joints will split open you'll have bulls and you'll have sores all across your body it's one of the most painful diseases there is it extremely painful she would say you know that she would that she got so bad and I just asked her about it one day CU I wasn't here for most of it but uh she told me she said kale there were some days I couldn't get out even get out to bed I would cry just to walk the blood will flow down my arms oh I would split open everywhere it was just sores everywhere so painful hurting and she told me when she told me the story she said Caleb I remember living my life and every day thinking I can't wait until I get my healing I can't wait until the Lord heals me I can't wait till one of these days I get enough faith and the Lord's going to heal me I can't wait till one of these days I'm going to be at a youth camp or I can't wait till one of these days I'm going to be at a big meeting I can't wait to one of these days oh but church I think that's what we do so many times is we get a problem we've got a storm we've got a battle and we think I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait till God gets big enough to deliver me I can't wait till my God gets big enough that he can heal me I can't wait I can't wait I'm here to tell you this morning today is your day don't wait no more there's no need to wait for it there's no need to put it aside but today is a day oh but she lived her life like this and she told me she said I even got that's where I was thinking I wonder what I'm going to do when I get healed oh I bet I'm going to dance I bet I'm going to shout I bet I'm going to run in circles I bet I'm going to do this I bet I'm going to do that and she began to fantasize about her healing now I'm telling you this morning you ain't never got a fantasize about your healing because it is right there for you to accept it but she began to fantasize and think in her mind oh I wonder when I wonder when I wonder when oh and oh for years she went out like this and she was sitting in Virginia one day and Uncle Wayne was preaching and the spirit of the Lord began to move through the building and you know now notice no preacher had to go lay her hands on her nobody had to go and I pray for her but she said just sitting in her seat while the word was coming forth oh there was something that just came down she said a revelation just hit my heart I'm not going to get healed tomorrow I'm not going to get healed next month I'm not going to get healed next year I'm not going to get healed next meeting but I had my healing before I ever had the sickness I had the Cure before I ever had the problem I had the answer before I ever had the condition oh I had the answer before I ever had the problem oh and she reached out and she just took a hold of it oh it was there all the time all she had to do was apply the blood all she had to do was speak the word all she had to do was apply the authority that was laying down on the inside of her the entire time now if you put up the first picture this is what she look like before that's what she looked like before she got her healing that's what she looked like before she spoke the blood that's what she looked like before she spoke Deliverance that's what she looked like before she spoke the blood over her life now go to the second picture and this is what she looked like after she spoke the blood that's what she looked like after she spoke Freedom that's what she look like after she spoke healing that's what she looked like after she spoke Deliverance that's what she looked like oh ex ain't got no power over Z Hoffman because there was a blood laying on the inside of her and that blood said you're healed that blood said no sickness raised the blood said no demons race the blood said no eema said I've got Zion but the blood said no oh depression said I've got Caleb but the blood said no oh demon said there's no way there'll be a group of young people in Le outa they can be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the blood said no oh he said there's no way there'll be 13 to 14 year old boys they can be Anointed with a pillar of fire but the blood said no he said there's no way there will be a church that'll be able to overcome oh and let got to see you well let me tell you

story next year rolls along and she hard started having some of the same symptoms come back she started have Bulls again she started have swords that would come up on her legs and on her arms and started to come up and she was talking with me about it we were dating another time and she was going through with me tell me about how much it was hurting again we went to Virginia meetings again

man was refused from Heaven the highways was closed but there were where there was no high alwayss he came to make one and the first line of demons were of doubt the next was Prejudice the next with selfishness the Earth was covered over with lines of demon power then sickness then diseases oh but when he began to ascend up to heaven last night we had him coming out of hell with the keys of hell and Death on his side oh but this morning we're taking him up Hallelujah and when he arose he was Triumph he wasn't triumphant he was Triumph he said he was Triumph and as he went up he broke every devil power that holds over man on down he said there was only one line cut down from glory and he left the bloody Footprints as he walked through the corridors of the demon powers and made a highway for us all the way through oh he said his bloody Footprints made a highway so that we could walk all the way through he walked through those demon corridors he began to open up sail after sail he began to get those keys and open up my cell oh he opened up Kobe's cell oh he opened up your cell he opened up your cell and he said it's okay he said I've opened up your cell and my bloody Footprints have made a highway that'll Lead You Back To The Cross it's made a highway for you to go straight back to Calvary oh I'm here to tell you this morning there is a blood that's made a Highway it'll lead you back to Calvary it'll lead you straight to Christ it'll leave you back to the word if you've strayed there's a high that will carry you back to the message of the hour if you've gone too far there is a highway that will take you back to the word there is a Highway oh hallelujah oh he's the blood made a way when there was no way the blood made a road when there was no Road the blood made a path

demon powers the blood begin to move out this one the blood begin to wipe away this one the blood begin to wipe away this one all I had to do was just follow the blood all I had to do was just walk in the blood all I had to do was just follow the blood and wherever the blood went demons weren't there wherever the blood went Devils were cast out wherever the blood went oh healing was there wherever the blood was Deliverance was there wherever the blood was Freedom was there wherever the blood blood was there was Victory oh just follow the blood this morning it's speaking for you oh oh when that blood begins to move through you oh there's nothing you can do to stop it oh you can't help but move they ask us why we move they ask us while we dance they ask us why we shout the answer is simple we can't help it the answer is simple oh there's too much blood pumping for us not to move there's too much blood moving for us not to dance there's too much blood circulating for us not to shout there's too much blood going oh when you get in this message and the Be Blood begins to flow I'm here to tell you this morning oh you'll move with the spirit you will move with the word you will move with the message oh when that Blood starts to flow oh they think we're crazy oh they say you can't dance they say you can't shout they say it's unscriptural they say it's unorthodox they say it's crazy oh let me tell you something oh I don't do it because I was told to I don't do it cuz I was taught to I do it cuz I'm alive I dance cuz I'm alive I shout cuz I'm alive I move because I am alive oh Cale ain't my personality oh okay it's just a emotional work of you know I did a study one time the world clap is used six times in the Bible the word jump is used 11 times in the Bible the word run is used 65 times in the Bible the word dance is used us 15 times the word shout used 34 times the word praise is used 188 times the word worship is used 234 times the word personality is used zero times the word emotion is used zero times the word work up is used zero times the word build up is used zero times oh the word Goosebumps is used zero times oh church if you stand with the word you ain't got to wait for an emotional workout to do it you'll praise him on the good days you'll praise him on the bad days you'll praise him on the mountain you'll Praise Him in the Al you're praise him when you're sick you praise him when you're healed you praise him when you feel like it you praise him when you don't feel like it because there is a blood that is moving and the blood is pumping on the good days it's still pumping on the bad days it's still pumping when I feel like it it's still P when I don't feel like it just there is a blood oh Hallelujah I can move because I've got it right and I've got oh I've got it right the blood says I can oh one of my favorite stories when the Titanic sank in 1912 one of my favorite stories that came out of it is there was a man by the name of Charles Joff and he was the head Baker on the ship you know as the ship began to sink the lifebts were filling up with children with women and everything and everybody was starting to panic the whole ship had just broke it was beginning to sink it was beginning to go under and everybody was oh everybody was screaming everybody was crying everybody around Charles was just running and jumping in the water and they jump in the water and they die within a matter of a minutes the water was so cold the water was so freezing the water was so deadly they died within a matter of minutes oh but Charles joffin began to move and he began to go to the liquor cabinet and he began to go open up those things and he grabbed all the liquor he could he grabbed all the wine he could and he wouldn't he jumped in that water just chugging away a liquor just chugging away a wine and he just drank all he could and The Story Goes that while everybody around him was dying everybody around him was screaming because of the they were in he said I not only survived but I was quite comfortable oh and I began to think about that story and I think of a natural wine of a natural alcohol could make a man completely forget his condition completely forget everything he was going through oh how much more can a new wine that's been given to her bride of Jesus Christ can it make us Run and Jump and overcome every obstacle the daily Waters won't hurt us the daily temperatures won't hurt us oh everybody around us is dying oh but we have had an alcohol inside of us oh and what alcohol does is it begins to thicken up the blood and
