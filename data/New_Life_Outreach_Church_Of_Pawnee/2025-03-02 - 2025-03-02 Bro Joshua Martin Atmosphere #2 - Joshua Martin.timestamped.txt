[36:36] incredible incredible blessing and so if
[36:39] you're if you're ready for it if it
[36:41] hopefully it'll all all work and so
[36:43] anyways this here is brother
[36:46] Allan here on the left that is the
[36:48] pastor's son brother Allan Lopez um he
[36:51] was the the one that's over the camp and
[36:54] everything the one in the middle is
[36:57] brother Joseph that was my translator uh
[37:00] for most of the week he he went
[37:02] everywhere with me U so that was that
[37:05] was a incredible blessing on the on the
[37:08] white as brother jonen um that was my
[37:10] chauffeur my driver most of everybody up
[37:13] there drives dirt bikes uh insurance and
[37:16] gas and things is is pretty expensive up
[37:19] there and actually uh I seen a family of
[37:22] five show up on a dirt bike at church
[37:24] you know and so so anyways but Joon and
[37:27] had a car um so this is my hotel room
[37:30] for the first couple of nights just
[37:32] something simple but hey there is AC and
[37:35] so I was happy for it and so and if you
[37:39] inside the bathroom there you see the
[37:40] little toilet paper hope it's still just
[37:42] the little little trash can hope this
[37:44] don't disgust yall out but you're not
[37:46] allowed to flush the toilet paper and so
[37:48] you got to put it inside the little
[37:50] trash can and I'm telling you what it
[37:52] took me a little bit to remember that I
[37:54] think I about call calls the Nationwide
[37:56] sew problem but uh we we finally got
[37:59] through it this is the outside of my
[38:00] hotel room it's a little eaten area you
[38:03] would walk out go to the window and
[38:05] order some food um this is on the
[38:08] outside I know it's on the sideways so
[38:11] that's what it look like on the outside
[38:12] of my hotel room a little a little rough
[38:15] but the hotel was a little a little
[38:17] gated thing there so you was perfectly
[38:20] safe this is a little traffic jam um
[38:23] through the the the streets of Manawa
[38:25] you can see that the GU put pushing a
[38:27] cart on the right and the guy in the
[38:29] middle I don't know what he's pushing
[38:30] there's a guy on the left on a donkey
[38:33] and so we're in a car trying to get
[38:35] through all of that so it was definitely
[38:37] definitely an experience um this here is
[38:40] the highest peak in Manawa the little
[38:43] girl is uh was brother Jonah's little
[38:45] daughter and so it's a beautiful scene
[38:48] right now the picture don't do it
[38:49] justice but it's all the lights and
[38:51] everything this is called a a a capernum
[38:54] if I can say that right that's a public
[38:56] transportation there in manwa a lot of
[38:59] the people can't afford cars and things
[39:00] so that's what they drive back and forth
[39:02] to work so we got to ride on one uh
[39:05] quite interesting really bumpy I think I
[39:07] got a video of us on it uh that's
[39:10] brother uh Joseph my
[39:12] interpreter then yeah there's the This
[39:14] Is Us going through downtown area there
[39:18] um there was nice parts of Manawa this
[39:21] is the capital city of Nicaragua um do
[39:23] you have that next one of us on
[39:26] it okay it's fine let's go to the next
[39:28] one but we got the right of this here is
[39:31] like their Central Park they would say
[39:33] and and it's normally more busier than
[39:35] this um this was late that night but you
[39:39] see all the trees lit up and things they
[39:41] said it's it's supposed to represent the
[39:42] tree of life and so that all downtown
[39:45] Manawa is nothing but those trees and
[39:47] there's toys I actually got a couple
[39:50] toys for the kids there but it's pretty
[39:52] neat just to experience some of their
[39:55] culture there you can go to the next
[39:58] one there we go that's on the the
[40:03] Caper yeah I think thing was pretty neat
[40:06] uh hot you can fill the engine a dirt
[40:08] bike behind you and it's a little basket
[40:10] in
[40:11] front and really bumpy I'm telling you
[40:14] what it's pretty neat getting to getting
[40:17] to see I think I turn the camera around
[40:19] here here here in a minute so you can s
[40:21] of see see the
[40:24] set yeah that's just the dirt bike
[40:26] behind it shifting gears as we're going
[40:29] go go to next this is Brother Allan so
[40:33] this is on Sunday um he is he's picking
[40:36] me up well he him and brother Jonah's
[40:38] picking me up we we were going to a
[40:40] service I didn't preach at his church
[40:42] but I preached at one of the local
[40:44] churches there um brother Sylvia if you
[40:46] can go to the next one that's brother
[40:48] Sylvia and it's it's it's always nice
[40:51] whenever you see the the picture of
[40:52] brother Brandon in a church you know so
[40:55] that's brother Sylvia and man this is uh
[40:57] his congregation as you can see there's
[41:00] there's windows but no glass so
[41:02] everything is open air and man we had a
[41:05] a wonderful time there I I really didn't
[41:08] know how they took it they were really
[41:10] reserved and and just just watching you
[41:13] know and it was at the camp brother
[41:15] Sylvia was there and he he was saying
[41:18] that you know CU he didn't say much at
[41:20] the at the meeting at that at the
[41:21] service at all he just thank you for
[41:23] coming you know so I was really
[41:26] wondering what was going on if if they
[41:28] were agreeing what I was preaching
[41:30] because I was preaching message pretty
[41:32] heavy and at the camp he would come up
[41:34] and would said you our elders have been
[41:36] talking about what your message the
[41:39] things you've been saying this is
[41:40] exactly what we've been needing what
[41:42] we've been praying for we want you to
[41:44] come back so that was encouraging that
[41:46] we wasn't just a waste of trip you know
[41:49] just sweating our our high end off you
[41:51] know just it was encouraging to hear
[41:53] that this is what we've been wanting I
[41:55] did my first baby dedication that was
[41:57] was interesting I'm sitting there in the
[41:59] office and the couple comes up and you
[42:01] know they're speaking to the translator
[42:02] and Brother Joseph goes well they want
[42:04] you to be dedicate their baby I said
[42:06] well if if you feel comfortable doing I
[42:08] well I've never done it before the
[42:10] little boy's name was Ethan so that was
[42:12] easy to remember and so yeah that that
[42:15] definitely was an interesting experience
[42:17] for me this is uh brother Manuel this is
[42:20] Brother Allen's father so he's the host
[42:22] pastor of the camp so we after our
[42:25] service that Sunday we would go over to
[42:27] his Fellowship Hall which is just this
[42:29] is their kitchen um that's just mud and
[42:32] and Clay packed together that's their
[42:35] stove there all their water is all on on
[42:38] the outside that's their Fellowship Hall
[42:40] just some tin you know some curtains
[42:42] dividing and things you know and I was
[42:44] telling telling Dad we we sort of get
[42:46] spoiled here our fellowship all we got
[42:48] electricity water inside you know so
[42:51] that that is what they gather in and in
[42:53] fellowship with and things this here is
[42:56] brother Allen's house
[42:57] now this really struck me you know as
[42:59] you at the very top there's a gap all
[43:02] the way around you know Cedar blocks all
[43:04] the way up there's 10 on the top but
[43:06] there's a gap like this all the way
[43:07] around that house and that's what they
[43:09] live in you know that's his freezer his
[43:11] water as you can see the the concrete is
[43:13] wet his sink is to the left of of the
[43:15] picture there which is on the on the
[43:17] porch and brother Zachary actually goes
[43:20] up here a lot this is where he
[43:22] missionaries a lot and they said Zachary
[43:24] put a hammock on their porch and slept
[43:26] there for like three or four days you
[43:28] know so I had a good time but I was in a
[43:30] hotel room Zachary is the the real deal
[43:33] he goes in the jungles this is Brother
[43:35] Paco so this is the brother that brother
[43:38] Zachary goes with um whenever he goes
[43:41] missionary and goes in all the all over
[43:44] uh South America that's that's who he
[43:46] goes with so this is the start of the
[43:48] camp this is on Monday night and so we
[43:51] had a total of well we I preached every
[43:53] day Sunday to Friday so this is Monday
[43:56] night the start of the camp and it
[43:58] started out really slow I we was hitting
[44:02] hitting a wall I preached Monday night
[44:04] and Tuesday morning then brother Solomon
[44:06] Huffman was there as well he preached
[44:08] Tuesday night Wednesday morning so that
[44:10] that's how the order of the services
[44:11] went so this is Monday night and man I
[44:14] I'm preaching and laboring there about
[44:16] 45 minutes into it it's starting to to
[44:19] break a little bit I'm halfway down the
[44:21] aisle and my microphone dies or brother
[44:23] Paco's microphone dies so I give him my
[44:26] microphone and my voice just completely
[44:29] rips and goes out so we ended up having
[44:31] to just close the service and speaking
[44:34] of my voice I forgot to add this part um
[44:36] the Sunday before I left to Nicaragua I
[44:40] preached a couple services and my voice
[44:43] was completely gone I woke up the next
[44:44] morning with the Cod my voice was gone
[44:47] all through that week and I knew I had
[44:49] seven services to preach that that that
[44:52] coming week and man and the family
[44:55] started to pray and I woke up that
[44:57] morning feeling great so the Lord was
[44:59] gracious to us so I lost my voice again
[45:02] but the Lord was gracious to give it
[45:03] back this is in the all little office
[45:05] area it's the cafeteria brother Paco
[45:08] there uh looking over some notes and
[45:10] things brother Solomon and brother
[45:12] brother Joseph I believe that was on
[45:14] Tuesday Tuesday night this is the the
[45:18] the building I guess the awning we was
[45:21] having Church in it's just a little
[45:22] gymnasium open open sides and things it
[45:25] it was in January but it was still hot
[45:28] you know' 70s 80s and humidity like
[45:32] crazy so this is Brother Solomon he
[45:34] plays piano I'm on the base this is one
[45:36] of the the young ladies that are singing
[45:38] We actually would sing a song together
[45:40] um she tried teaching me to sing in
[45:43] Spanish but I tried and I could not
[45:46] figure it out for the life of me um this
[45:48] is their musicians and every service
[45:51] they would alternate a different song
[45:52] leader different and each one of them is
[45:55] on different instruments every night and
[45:57] they're phenomenal I was blown away on
[46:00] how how talented their their musicians
[46:02] are so this is them so going to go to
[46:05] the next one this is the the boys are
[46:07] singing a singing a special um that's
[46:10] the girls singing a special you know
[46:12] seen their the long dresses and things
[46:14] and a lot of these girls here actually
[46:17] came from man the Atlantic coast I think
[46:21] is where they're from and actually and
[46:23] they would tell me that they would have
[46:25] to they would have to write ride a boat
[46:27] for 10 hours and on a bus for 16 hours
[46:31] to get to that camp you know and I and
[46:33] here we are we got a camp what an hour
[46:35] from us we got a camp in Louisiana
[46:37] that's 7 hours uh Ohio is 13 hours South
[46:41] Carolina is 16 hours you know and here
[46:44] they had to ride a boat 10 hours and a
[46:46] bus for 16 hours and that really done
[46:49] something for my heart knowing they did
[46:51] everything it took to get there so this
[46:53] is Wednesday night and so we we we plow
[46:56] for four Services Monday Tuesday brother
[46:59] Solomon and I and we were hit in the
[47:01] stone wall and and I shut myself in my
[47:04] room and was saying Lord we need a
[47:05] breakthrough you know I I I don't know
[47:07] what to do I'm doing what I what I know
[47:09] to do I'm preaching the message strong I
[47:12] trying to break the atmosphere you know
[47:15] and then the Lord would start to deal me
[47:17] on the atmosphere what I was what I've
[47:19] been preaching and uh and I was talking
[47:21] to brother Paco and I said brother Paco
[47:24] we need a breakthrough I I I don't know
[47:26] what we're going to to do these kids are
[47:28] here I'm trying everything I know to do
[47:31] and I'm reading on atmosphere on my iPad
[47:33] while while we're there in the office
[47:35] and I come across this quote brother
[47:37] brandham said and there's no no one
[47:39] person can do it by themselves it takes
[47:42] us all together to pull together to pray
[47:45] together to stand together in unity in
[47:47] the spirit and pray for this Brethren
[47:50] have been telling me that the churches
[47:51] has been PR and had prayer meetings
[47:54] prior to this meeting and I'm so
[47:55] thankful for that when you gather
[47:57] together and pray like that it changes
[48:00] the whole atmosphere and so I I
[48:02] mentioned brother Paco I said well they
[48:04] feel comfortable with just laying hands
[48:05] on each other at the beginning of before
[48:08] I preach and just and I read this quote
[48:10] and we pray but apocal says yeah let
[48:13] let's try it and I'm telling you I read
[48:15] this quote and there was an atmosphere
[48:17] that just came in a special way we laid
[48:20] hands on one another and as we prayed
[48:22] that atmosphere broke and this is at the
[48:24] end of the service there was no move
[48:26] like it it it was a stone wall but after
[48:29] that service and preaching on atmosphere
[48:30] the altars was full the brother there in
[48:33] the white right next to the girl in the
[48:35] dress as I'm praying I'm going down the
[48:36] line he just grabs me and just balling
[48:39] his eyes out wouldn't let me go and I
[48:42] said I was sitting there crying with him
[48:44] knowing that if the atmosphere can just
[48:46] change you all it takes is the
[48:48] atmosphere to change and breakthroughs
[48:50] can to happen you know so that that was
[48:52] the highlight for me of the meeting
[48:54] right after that we were soaring it was
[48:56] it was WI open after that service go to
[48:59] the next one so this is that next
[49:01] morning actually I'm telling the
[49:03] testimony of brother Joe and sister
[49:04] Stephanie right here the power of the
[49:06] message I told him that the testimony of
[49:08] Caleb and again the anointing of God
[49:11] would just come through there and the
[49:13] kids were glued some crying and and and
[49:16] some of them was coming up to brother
[49:17] Paco and says I I didn't want to come to
[49:20] the camp I had no desire but I came here
[49:23] to see the authority of this message you
[49:25] know and here I am telling the testimony
[49:28] of what this message can do for drug
[49:30] addicts I was telling how Joe was a
[49:33] thief now he's a trustee you know
[49:35] Stephanie was an atheist now she's
[49:37] teaching our children about God you know
[49:39] and an anointing just would come through
[49:41] that building and kids realizing
[49:43] connecting the dots that he Jesus Christ
[49:46] is still alive today you know and so you
[49:49] can go to the next one we baptized to um
[49:51] this is a young lady we baptized
[49:54] baptized to the water was was cold uh
[49:56] you can go to the next one this is all
[49:59] of them gathering on the outside of the
[50:01] pool um there and the sun was bright
[50:04] we're on the wrong side of the pool I
[50:06] guess and I'm I can barely see you can
[50:08] my my hands over my eyes they're they're
[50:10] singing and things like that uh there's
[50:12] a few more of the kids around the pool
[50:15] there that's another one this one here I
[50:17] guess don't like water and man I I it it
[50:21] I never experienced anything like this
[50:22] before so I baptized the first one you
[50:24] know and I I go to baptize this the
[50:27] second one and she's fighting and she's
[50:29] fight I'm pushing and I and I just pull
[50:31] her back up and brother apocal says no
[50:33] she didn't go all the way under she says
[50:35] her forehead's still up I looked at him
[50:37] he says no he says do it again I'm like
[50:40] so I grab her and I and I and she's
[50:42] fighting again and I'm pushing and we
[50:44] finally got her under barely we barely
[50:47] got her under but that I I never
[50:48] experienced that before in my life you
[50:50] know so this is in the kitchen this is
[50:52] Sister Jessica brother Allan's wife on
[50:54] the right here and man they worked hard
[50:57] the food was amazing uh you can go to
[50:59] the next one um some more of the ladies
[51:02] there the kitchen was hot no AC this is
[51:04] on them on the outside late at night
[51:06] washing dishes and things it sort of
[51:09] reminded me of our camp and how much
[51:11] work we had to do at camp Crossway so
[51:13] this is their food so the on the very
[51:16] top is called a plene and it's like our
[51:19] potato they cook it every different
[51:21] direction telling you that that that
[51:23] there was really mushy if you you can go
[51:25] to the next one
[51:27] uh uh this here is the this here is a
[51:30] common breakfast meal which is this rice
[51:32] beans eggs and
[51:34] toast um that's a planteen as well so
[51:36] you can fry it and it's it's shaped like
[51:38] a banana so that's another another way
[51:41] you can eat a plene that's fish I never
[51:44] eat anything like that before where the
[51:46] eyeballs were staring at me so I was
[51:49] watching them do it and telling you what
[51:51] I I I just sucked it up ate it and it
[51:54] was delicious they were eating the heads
[51:56] the brains and I I didn't do that but
[51:58] that's more plene that's another plantin
[52:00] that's like a spud they got meat in the
[52:02] middle so it's it's pretty neat seeing
[52:05] oh what what they can do this here is
[52:07] the the fellowship hall there of the
[52:11] cafeteria and so the theme of the camp
[52:14] was fear no more and so I thought that
[52:17] pretty neat that's what that means up
[52:19] there fear no
[52:20] more so this is uh brother Paco on the
[52:24] left myself brother Allan brother
[52:25] Solomon this is at the end of the camp
[52:28] we we had our last service on Friday
[52:30] night so this is Brother uh y'all may
[52:34] know him uh brother uh this is Brother
[52:36] David Nash from Washington I had never
[52:38] met him before never heard of him before
[52:41] but everybody up there were asking do
[52:43] you know a David Nash a David Nash and
[52:45] no I never have everybody was asking
[52:47] about brother James Miller you know it
[52:49] it's pretty neat I got to talk to him on
[52:51] Thursday you know letting him know that
[52:53] everybody's still asking about brother
[52:54] Miller and things you know but this is a
[52:56] missionary he's from Washington that he
[52:58] goes in the jungles and he he stays up
[53:00] there for months and so it was nice
[53:03] being able being able to Mee him so the
[53:05] girls on the right is uh uh some they
[53:08] got a her father has passed away but he
[53:12] was a pastor in Manawa and has a well
[53:15] established business in in the city
[53:18] there so they took us out to eat and

[53:24] they there it is they treated that's
[53:26] very very well uh uh very giving people
[53:30] you know so you can go to the next one
[53:33] that's outside the restaurant like the
[53:35] rest the the the waiters have bow ties
[53:37] on and vests you know they they they
[53:39] really treated us very well when to this
[53:42] restaurant this is on the in the airport
[53:44] in Manawa we're about to fly out on
[53:46] Saturday
[53:47] morning um I don't know if y'all
[53:49] recognize this guy or not this is
[53:51] Brother Jimmy from Camp Crossway what
[53:54] are the odds we're on the same plane
[53:56] plane flying into Manawa and on the same

[54:23] know but it it was pretty funny we was
[54:25] laughing teasing each other I I blend in

[54:31] sound for
[54:33] that and their worship is just just
[54:36] wonderful

[57:39] seated um I'm just going to continue on
[57:42] on atmosphere just for a few more few
[57:45] more minutes tonight um but brother
[57:47] Brandon would say blessing us with what
[57:49] Divine Healing for knowledge Revelation
[57:52] Visions Powers tongues interpretations
[57:55] wisdom knowledge all heav all the
[57:58] Heavenly blessings joy unspeakable full
[58:00] of Glory every heart filled with the
[58:03] spirit walking together sitting together
[58:07] in Heavenly places not one evil thought
[58:09] Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one
[58:12] short dress not one this that or the
[58:15] other not one evil thought nobody got
[58:17] anything against one another everybody
[58:19] speaking in love Harmony everybody in
[58:22] One Accord in one place then suddenly
[58:26] there came from Heaven a sound like a
[58:28] rushing Mighty Wind there you are he has
[58:31] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[58:34] and so uh on Wednesday was talking about
[58:36] how we're we've been seated into
[58:38] Heavenly places and brother Brandon is
[58:40] telling us this is what is in Heavenly
[58:43] places this these are the blessings that
[58:46] the God is giving us when we can get
[58:48] into this other atmosphere and I don't
[58:50] believe that that they're empty promises
[58:53] or or or or something that the message
[58:55] has said we can have but we can never
[58:57] obtain but I believe whatever this
[58:59] message has told us we can have and what
[59:02] the word told us we can have I believe
[59:04] we can achieve it we're we're not uh the
[59:06] blind leading the blind but we got a
[59:08] direction that we are following and
[59:10] brother Brandon would say now we know
[59:13] that it's nice to have churches that's
[59:15] wonderful we know it's nice to have
[59:16] denominations they're wonderful it's
[59:18] nice to have seminaries it's wonderful
[59:21] but Christ never told us to build any
[59:23] seminaries or anything like that he said
[59:26] preach the gospel and the gospel isn't
[59:28] word only but through the power and
[59:30] manifestation of the Holy Spirit which
[59:33] would produce the signs of Mark 16 when
[59:36] he said go into all the world and preach
[59:38] the gospel to Every Creature these signs
[59:40] shall follow them the word itself is
[59:42] dead until it becomes into an action and
[59:46] produces the life so the gospel is not
[59:49] word only but it's the demonstration of
[59:51] the power of the Holy Ghost and so all
[59:54] of these these these these promises that
[59:56] are in Heavenly places would stay there
[59:59] until we get into the right atmosphere
[1:00:01] until we're we're conditioned for the
[1:00:04] word to come in fulfillment and brother
[1:00:06] Brandon would say except the corn of
[1:00:07] wheat Fallen to the ground it abides
[1:00:10] alone then when the word is brought into
[1:00:12] a heart of faith that makes every
[1:00:15] promise in the Bible live again see it's
[1:00:18] got to live it must live if it's
[1:00:21] received in the right place under the
[1:00:23] right condition every seed will live
[1:00:26] again if it's put under the right
[1:00:28] condition so that's why we have to get
[1:00:31] into the right atmosphere that's the
[1:00:32] reason we have to condition ourself or
[1:00:35] our ground brother brandom is putting it
[1:00:37] that you're the field you know the word
[1:00:39] is the seed that's going to fall into
[1:00:41] your field but unless your condition the
[1:00:44] word is never going to be brought to
[1:00:46] life it's it's going to lay dormant
[1:00:48] there and the Bible would would tell us
[1:00:50] the parable of the sewer and even though
[1:00:52] that the that the the the the the the
[1:00:54] the man sewing the seed was a good man
[1:00:56] the the seed was good seed it wasn't
[1:00:59] something that was rotten but the reason
[1:01:01] why it would not bring forth was the
[1:01:03] condition of the ground you know and the
[1:01:05] Bible would tell us that some seed fell
[1:01:07] by the wayside some fell by on Stony
[1:01:10] ground and and and I like one part of it
[1:01:12] it says that that the seed fell into
[1:01:14] into some soil and as it would start to
[1:01:17] come up there was no moisture to water
[1:01:20] the seed and brother Brandon would tell
[1:01:22] us that is representation of the Holy
[1:01:23] Ghost you know the the the the the word
[1:01:25] can fall but unless there's the moisture
[1:01:28] of the Holy Ghost it's going to dry up
[1:01:30] and die and one of them brother Jesus
[1:01:32] would say that as the as the the fruit
[1:01:35] started to come up they be they became
[1:01:37] offended at the gospel he says they
[1:01:40] started to go through some things and
[1:01:42] then they got offended at the gospel
[1:01:44] then their fruit dried up and died and
[1:01:47] sometimes we can get to that place that
[1:01:48] we get offended at God get offended you
[1:01:51] know we feel like he's forsaken us that
[1:01:52] he's left us we go through hard times go
[1:01:55] through some Circ cumstances and as we
[1:01:57] become offended our ground is not
[1:02:00] conditioned the way it's supposed to be
[1:02:02] that's when we lose our joy lose our
[1:02:04] peace lose our happiness but if we can
[1:02:06] just get back to the right condition
[1:02:08] that same word can fall into it and the
[1:02:11] seed must live if it's received in the
[1:02:14] right Condition it's got to live and
[1:02:16] brother Brandon would talk about the law
[1:02:18] of electricity he would say that
[1:02:20] Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity
[1:02:23] with a a kite and a key right in in a
[1:02:25] bottle I think and brother brandom says
[1:02:27] whenever lightning hit that he was
[1:02:29] running around saying I got it I got it
[1:02:32] I got it brother brandom says he didn't
[1:02:33] know what he had but he knew that he got
[1:02:36] it then Thomas Edison would come along
[1:02:38] and would not just know that something
[1:02:41] is here but he would realize the law of
[1:02:44] it and as Thomas Edison would would
[1:02:46] discover the light bulb he wasn't just
[1:02:48] saying I've got some power but I can
[1:02:50] grab that power and put it into action
[1:02:53] and I don't believe we're just running
[1:02:55] around and saying we got a message we
[1:02:56] got a message we got a message but we
[1:02:58] know the life of the message there
[1:03:01] there's a life that is on the inside of
[1:03:03] the bride and you see Thomas Edison
[1:03:06] could just find the law of it to produce
[1:03:08] it and there's the law of the word and
[1:03:11] brother Brandon is telling us your your
[1:03:13] your your your heart has to be
[1:03:15] conditioned the right way and brother
[1:03:18] Brandon talking about electricity he
[1:03:20] says when if you go into the dark
[1:03:22] mountains and and you're stumbling
[1:03:23] around in darkness and maybe you you
[1:03:25] step on a snake or fall into a hole he
[1:03:28] says it would do you no good to say
[1:03:31] electricity where are you electricity
[1:03:33] light it up you know he says it does no
[1:03:36] good until you follow the laws of
[1:03:39] electricity you see so whenever you when
[1:03:41] you're in the darkness you got to find
[1:03:43] the law of it first and sometimes before
[1:03:45] we cry out to God we got to go through
[1:03:47] hard times but we got to go back to the
[1:03:50] law of it getting into the right
[1:03:52] atmosphere even when we're struggling
[1:03:55] and and having mind battles if we can
[1:03:56] just get into the right atmosphere that
[1:03:59] same word that spoke in the beginning
[1:04:01] can fall over our lives and brother
[1:04:04] Brandon would tell this here and I said
[1:04:06] to a friend it's the atmosphere that's
[1:04:08] what it is if you want to have a great
[1:04:11] healing service here tonight let's have
[1:04:13] a great atmosphere of belief believing
[1:04:16] you're going to be healed see no matter
[1:04:18] how real Jesus would be here at the
[1:04:21] platform or out or out there he could
[1:04:24] not heal you unless unless the
[1:04:26] atmosphere is right for your healing
[1:04:28] ain't that powerful he says if you're
[1:04:30] wanting healing and even if the Corporal
[1:04:33] body of Jesus was upon this platform he
[1:04:36] could not heal you until you came into
[1:04:39] the right atmosphere and oh myel brother
[1:04:41] Brandon would tell us we Christ is here
[1:04:44] in every aspect but the Corporal body
[1:04:47] because many times we we I I know I've
[1:04:49] thought of it if I could just stand
[1:04:50] before Jesus or or stand before the
[1:04:52] prophet he he he can look over my heart
[1:04:55] and and give me a a vision or or bring a
[1:04:58] healing or or a peace of mind and here
[1:05:00] brother brandom is saying even if Jesus
[1:05:02] was here he couldn't do nothing for you
[1:05:05] until you get into the right atmosphere
[1:05:07] so we don't need the Corporal Body of
[1:05:10] Christ here all we need is an atmosphere
[1:05:13] of the Holy Ghost that his word can fall
[1:05:16] into and produce the results oh
[1:05:20] Hallelujah brother Brandon he would say
[1:05:21] in one place that that the 120 they were
[1:05:25] in one cord one place gathered together
[1:05:28] under the atmosphere of expecting God to
[1:05:31] move and do signs and wonders and he
[1:05:33] says let's move ourselves up into that
[1:05:36] bracket step up into faith and move out
[1:05:39] of these three dimensions into the next
[1:05:42] one so brother Bram is's putting it that
[1:05:45] the 120 when they were in the upper room
[1:05:48] that atmosphere was created by their
[1:05:50] expectation and then they would step out
[1:05:53] of this Earthly Dimension into a
[1:05:55] heavenly atmosphere and he says so can
[1:05:58] we he says let us move oursel out of
[1:06:00] this bracket by faith and step out of
[1:06:04] this Dimension into that other dimension
[1:06:06] brother Brandon would talk about the 120
[1:06:08] in the upper room and would say that
[1:06:10] that that that they were praising God
[1:06:12] and blessing God for the Holy Ghost even
[1:06:15] when the Holy Ghost wasn't there yet
[1:06:17] they were blessing God for the promise
[1:06:20] of the Holy Ghost and he says while they
[1:06:22] were there blessing God for it he says
[1:06:24] that atmosphere was created then the
[1:06:27] promise of the Holy Ghost fell upon them
[1:06:30] so even when they did not see a change
[1:06:32] yet see a difference yet or or feel any
[1:06:35] emotion yet or or a sensation yet they
[1:06:38] were still praising God knowing that my
[1:06:40] praise can create an atmosphere that the
[1:06:43] promised word can be fulfilled in that's
[1:06:46] why we praise God even when we're low
[1:06:48] even when we're tired even when we don't
[1:06:50] see anything different in our
[1:06:52] circumstances Our Praise can create an
[1:06:55] act atmosphere that changes
[1:06:57] circumstances oh come on now your praise
[1:07:00] in the middle of your hard time just
[1:07:02] like Paul and Silas as they were chained
[1:07:03] up in the prison cell their praise
[1:07:06] changed that atmosphere that would bring
[1:07:08] the walls crumbling down and your praise
[1:07:11] even in the hard time can change the
[1:07:14] atmosphere around you and the conditions
[1:07:16] that the promised word can be fulfilled
[1:07:19] that's what we need today is some more
[1:07:21] worshippers that knows what it's like
[1:07:24] that lay their troubles aside to lay
[1:07:26] their heart fillings aside and the
[1:07:27] bitterness aside and say God I'm coming
[1:07:30] under an expectation to see God move and
[1:07:33] as we lift up holy hands God inhabits
[1:07:37] the Praises of the people oh Hallelujah
[1:07:40] you see and and and I know I mentioned
[1:07:43] this on Wednesday but brother brandom
[1:07:44] talks about the acorn and and I heard
[1:07:47] this today and man I I just loved that
[1:07:49] he says if I give you an acorn or or if
[1:07:52] I said I'm going to give you an acorn
[1:07:54] tree and the just just give you an acorn
[1:07:57] he says everything that is in that tree
[1:07:59] is in the acorn and I left brother
[1:08:01] Brandon would put it he would say all
[1:08:03] right brother Brandon I'm going to try
[1:08:05] and see if this will work and grow down
[1:08:07] here in my backyard and and you would
[1:08:09] say I'm going to put it in the right
[1:08:11] kind of soil just like you got up North
[1:08:15] I'm going to see if it'll grow here and
[1:08:17] I love that because we got churches all
[1:08:19] all over America all over the world and
[1:08:22] many times we look at other churches and
[1:08:24] think my goodness why can't we be in
[1:08:26] Revival like them why can't we see the
[1:08:28] supernatural like that church or or see
[1:08:31] the see healings and miracles and
[1:08:33] deliverances like that church for the
[1:08:35] brandom says that Acorn seed can be put
[1:08:37] in the north just like the South and
[1:08:40] it'll produce the same results so it
[1:08:42] ain't the church that has a magic power
[1:08:45] it's the soil it's you that can create
[1:08:48] the atmosphere that brings forth
[1:08:50] healings and deliverances and revivals
[1:08:53] and refilling of the Holy goost you see
[1:08:56] I I I don't believe that the power of
[1:08:58] God is just for the book of Acts or or
[1:09:00] just for a special people or or a few
[1:09:03] ministers but I believe that everybody
[1:09:05] that can condition them themselves in
[1:09:07] the right channel can see a Revival like
[1:09:10] never before in every one of our lives
[1:09:13] and you see brother Brandon would talk
[1:09:15] about would talk about the the the the
[1:09:17] grain of wheat that was in Egypt and I
[1:09:19] think this was back in the ' 50s they
[1:09:20] found a grain of wheat that was in the
[1:09:23] Gardeners of Joseph right whenever
[1:09:25] whenever the famine and he created all
[1:09:27] those buildings and things and he put
[1:09:29] wheat inside of it but the brandom says
[1:09:31] they they got that little grain of wheat
[1:09:33] and put it here in America I believe in
[1:09:36] the right kind of soil then it would
[1:09:38] produce the same results as it did back
[1:09:41] then even though it was what 2500 years
[1:09:44] later 3,000 years later it was the life
[1:09:47] of that seed in the right soil and oh my
[1:09:51] we're not living in the day of the book
[1:09:53] of Acts of John and and the Apostle Paul
[1:09:56] but we got the same seed we're not in
[1:09:58] Jerusalem we're not in Bethlehem but
[1:10:01] right here in Pony oleah home and the
[1:10:03] same power that fell in that Upper Room
[1:10:06] can still fall at New Life Outreach like
[1:10:09] never before we can still see the power
[1:10:12] of God like never before and and right
[1:10:15] after this brother Brandon will talk
[1:10:17] about a painted fire and he says
[1:10:18] wouldn't it be crazy if you was freezing
[1:10:21] and I brought you inside and and put you
[1:10:23] by a painted fire and says here let this
[1:10:26] warm you up a little bit brother brandom
[1:10:28] says that pain and fire is talking of
[1:10:31] something of yesterday and he says that
[1:10:33] pain and fire cannot warm you today oh
[1:10:36] my it's speaking of something in the day
[1:10:38] gone by and oh my I don't believe we're
[1:10:41] preaching a gospel of a day gone by a
[1:10:43] gospel of yesterday cannot heal you
[1:10:46] today a gospel of yesterday cannot save
[1:10:48] your children today but a god of today a
[1:10:52] Bible of today a message of today can
[1:10:55] warm every one of our Lives oh
[1:10:57] Hallelujah brother brandom says could
[1:10:59] you imagine people freezing to death and
[1:11:01] and I would paint them a a picture of a
[1:11:03] fire and say look at the fire burning
[1:11:05] isn't it warm look up the people
[1:11:07] standing around warming but that's only
[1:11:10] a picture of something that has been
[1:11:12] you'll just freeze the same looking at
[1:11:15] the picture what it takes is that fire
[1:11:18] to be reproduced again for your warmth
[1:11:22] oh my for that fire to be reproduced
[1:11:25] again in for your warmth and I believe
[1:11:27] that's what we need our new life
[1:11:29] Outreach I believe all of us can can can
[1:11:31] say that together with me is I want to
[1:11:33] see the fire of God like it did at the
[1:11:36] old building I want to see the fire of
[1:11:37] God like it did for the book of Acts I
[1:11:40] want to see the fire of God like it did
[1:11:42] for brother Brandon but what we need is
[1:11:44] to rekindle the Flames of today you see
[1:11:47] brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:11:49] there's a difference between glowing and
[1:11:51] shining right he says Hollywood shines
[1:11:53] but the gospel glows he says the shine
[1:11:56] shine is something on the outside but he
[1:11:58] says glowing is from the inside that
[1:12:01] comes to the outside and that's what we
[1:12:03] need is not paintting fires that can
[1:12:06] shine uh good religion shine nice
[1:12:08] dresses and and shine nice suits but
[1:12:10] what we need is the fire of the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost to burn on the inside and that'll
[1:12:15] start to glow on the outside that this
[1:12:18] ain't just some religion of yesterday
[1:12:20] but it is a reality of
[1:12:22] today hallelujah we're not to shine the
[1:12:25] gospel we're to Glow the gospel we have
[1:12:28] become the Revival oh Hallelujah you see
[1:12:32] I believe a gospel can still put a
[1:12:34] praise on people's lips even when we
[1:12:36] don't feel like it we can get in that
[1:12:38] right condition get into that right
[1:12:40] atmosphere what it is is we've come into
[1:12:43] a place where the word of God can come
[1:12:46] and and bring forth the life and brother
[1:12:48] Brandon or the Bible Will Tell Us in the
[1:12:50] Old Testament that only the high priests
[1:12:53] could go into the holiest of holies
[1:12:55] right and before they could go into the
[1:12:57] holiest of holies they first had to be
[1:12:59] conditioned right they had to may have
[1:13:01] the right garments on they they had to
[1:13:04] to do a certain way and they had to have
[1:13:05] a bail upon the bottom of their the
[1:13:07] bottom of their uh their dress there and
[1:13:09] they were to dance holy holy you know
[1:13:12] you so before they could go into the
[1:13:15] holiest of holies they first had to be
[1:13:17] conditioned oh my many times we we want
[1:13:20] to get into the presence of God but
[1:13:22] we're not willing to condition oursel
[1:13:24] we're not willing to throw things out
[1:13:26] we're not willing to lay things aside
[1:13:29] and you see brother brandom said the
[1:13:31] high priest had to be holy dedicated and
[1:13:34] anointed and I don't believe God has
[1:13:36] changed his mind if he required the high
[1:13:39] priest to be holy and dedicated and
[1:13:41] anointed to get into that presence God
[1:13:44] still requires that today right he still
[1:13:47] requires a way of Holiness the Bible
[1:13:49] would say a highway shall be there and a
[1:13:51] way and it shall be called the way of
[1:13:54] Holiness and brother brandom he would
[1:13:55] take this the scripture many times and
[1:13:58] would say it's not a Highway of Holiness
[1:14:01] it's a way of Holiness and he says that
[1:14:03] way is in the middle of the highway he
[1:14:06] says not on the sides cuz that's where
[1:14:08] all the trash is Oh my he says the way
[1:14:11] is in the middle of that highway so the
[1:14:13] water can push all the trash off and
[1:14:16] there's no puddles in the middle of that
[1:14:18] and many times we get to the left or to
[1:14:21] the right and we start to accumulate
[1:14:23] things but all you have to do is get
[1:14:25] back on the way of Holiness and let the
[1:14:28] refilling of the Holy Ghost push those
[1:14:30] things that you started to accumulate oh
[1:14:33] Hallelujah you see if it's built right
[1:14:35] brother brandom says you don't have
[1:14:37] puddles standing in your road all the
[1:14:39] time if it's built right so if you're
[1:14:41] built right in the middle of the road
[1:14:44] there's no trash there's no puddles that
[1:14:46] are starting to accumulate in our lives
[1:14:49] and you see but the brownon would talk
[1:14:50] about the Baptist and would say the
[1:14:52] Baptists are fundamentally right but
[1:14:54] they know nothing about the Supernatural
[1:14:57] and and I thought my goodness we can be
[1:14:59] right fundamentally you know we can have
[1:15:01] all the dos and don'ts down and brother
[1:15:03] brandom says if they don't know and I'll
[1:15:05] just read it to you and he says but they
[1:15:07] know nothing about the supernatural my
[1:15:09] brethren that's where you're losing the
[1:15:12] blessing oh my is whenever you get away
[1:15:15] from the supernatural you start to lose
[1:15:17] our spiritual blessings we can still be
[1:15:20] blessed you know maybe have a a nice car
[1:15:22] or a nice house and lots of money in the
[1:15:25] bank account you know but that's not the
[1:15:27] blessings that God promised us he
[1:15:29] promised us spiritual blessings that's
[1:15:32] what I want in my life that's what I
[1:15:34] want in this church it's not just
[1:15:36] blessings I want spiritual blessings I
[1:15:39] want a joy that can come on the inside
[1:15:41] even when I'm sad I want blessings in in
[1:15:44] my children's lives when they go through
[1:15:46] peer pressure the spiritual blessings
[1:15:48] are still there because I've conditioned
[1:15:51] them by my
[1:15:53] atmosphere Hallelujah that the
[1:15:55] supernatural can bring forth the
[1:15:58] blessings oh Hallelujah brother Brandon
[1:16:00] would say and so I believe tonight that
[1:16:03] the holy spirit is here it's here for
[1:16:05] those who were destined to receive it
[1:16:08] who believe that believes it who is who
[1:16:10] is waiting on it I'm here it's here to
[1:16:13] straighten out every one of their
[1:16:15] spiritual problems it's here to heal
[1:16:17] every sick person that is present it's
[1:16:20] here but you've got to come and get in
[1:16:23] the atmosphere of it and the attitude to
[1:16:26] receive it ain't that powerful he says
[1:16:29] the Holy Ghost is here to straighten out
[1:16:32] all of your spiritual problems you see
[1:16:34] we don't need some psychologist right we
[1:16:36] don't need some some some 10-step
[1:16:38] program to get our life right and and
[1:16:40] teach us how to live all we need to do
[1:16:43] is get into the atmosphere of it and let
[1:16:46] the Holy Ghost fix all of our spiritual
[1:16:48] problems I believe he can still fix
[1:16:50] marital problems he can still save and
[1:16:52] and deliver rebellious teenagers that
[1:16:55] are bound by addictions I believe that
[1:16:57] it can take a a man that is on the on
[1:16:59] the verge of a mental breakdown and
[1:17:01] bring him back and bringing
[1:17:03] encouragement I believe God can still do
[1:17:05] it but it's getting into the atmosphere
[1:17:08] of it I still believe that our children
[1:17:10] can be on fire with the things of God
[1:17:12] they they can dance in the spirit and
[1:17:14] and speak in tongues if God permits them
[1:17:16] to do it I believe those things ain't
[1:17:18] behind us but the bride's Revival is
[1:17:21] still in action today if we as a
[1:17:25] congregation is willing to persevere for
[1:17:28] it if we're willing to fight for it and
[1:17:30] say God I'm tired of a dead religion I
[1:17:33] want to live in God up today I'm tired
[1:17:36] of just hearing testimonies of what God
[1:17:38] used to do I want to see God heal today
[1:17:41] I want to see God fill today I want to
[1:17:43] see a Revival today not a painted fire
[1:17:48] but a Revival of today oh and if you
[1:17:50] wanted tonight little church the
[1:17:52] blessings of God is waiting for for you
[1:17:55] to be conditioned the right way oh
[1:17:58] Hallelujah to get on the way of Holiness
[1:18:02] oh Hallelujah that's what we need
[1:18:04] Ephesians 4:23 which saying be renewed
[1:18:07] in the spirit of your mind that you put
[1:18:10] on the new man which is after God in
[1:18:13] righteousness and true Holiness so true
[1:18:17] Holiness is more than on the outside
[1:18:19] true Holiness is on the inside and then
[1:18:22] the Apostle Paul would tell us what true
[1:18:24] Holiness is in the next verse wherefore
[1:18:27] putting away lying speak every man truth
[1:18:30] with his neighbor for we are members of
[1:18:32] one another be you angry and sin not let
[1:18:35] the sun go down uh let let not the sun
[1:18:38] go down upon your wrath neither give
[1:18:40] place to the devil let him that steal
[1:18:44] steal no more but rather let him labor
[1:18:46] working with his hands the thing which
[1:18:49] is good that he might have he may have G
[1:18:51] to give to them that needeth and griev
[1:18:54] not the holy spirit of God whereby ye
[1:18:57] are sealed unto the day of your
[1:18:59] Redemption let all bitterness wrath
[1:19:02] anger claim or evil speaking but be
[1:19:04] pulled away from you with all malice
[1:19:07] that's what true Holiness is true
[1:19:10] Holiness Ain ain't a guy with a you know
[1:19:12] short hair and tattoos that don't have
[1:19:14] tattoos all over him or or a young lady
[1:19:16] with the long hair and a nice dress that
[1:19:19] ain't true Holiness that's Holiness but
[1:19:21] true Holiness is deeper on the inside
[1:19:25] the glowing of the Holy Ghost where
[1:19:27] there's no more bitterness there's no
[1:19:29] more anger there's no more wrath even
[1:19:31] when we fight these things we're not
[1:19:34] giving the devil any room oh come on now
[1:19:37] too many times we back up the spirits we
[1:19:39] back up the to mood swings we back up to
[1:19:42] these things instead of giving no place
[1:19:44] for the devil brother the Brandon would
[1:19:46] tell us the way of God is Holiness let
[1:19:49] this be known to every member here of
[1:19:51] the body of Christ until you live a
[1:19:54] whole life God refuses your sacrifice
[1:19:57] the sacrifice must be offered by holy
[1:20:01] hands so the way of God is Holiness and
[1:20:04] it is a holy life which is something on
[1:20:07] the inside you know brother the brown
[1:20:09] and would talk about about the children
[1:20:10] of Israel and would say they could not
[1:20:13] go into the promised land because they
[1:20:15] was not conditioned for it ain't that
[1:20:17] crazy he says they were not conditioned
[1:20:20] for it and so God would no longer deal
[1:20:22] with them God would no longer would no
[1:20:25] longer come to them he would not take
[1:20:27] them to the promised land until they
[1:20:29] realized they they were dead in their
[1:20:32] theories then God took them over so they
[1:20:35] had to realize what they had their
[1:20:38] painted fire was not conditioning them
[1:20:41] to go on the other side and then once
[1:20:43] they realize that brother Bram says then
[1:20:46] God can take them over you see I don't
[1:20:49] believe God has promised us spiritual
[1:20:51] blessings and will not take us over but
[1:20:54] we got to realize that the painted fire
[1:20:57] is no longer good enough I need
[1:20:59] something of today then God will take us
[1:21:03] over into all spiritual blessings and
[1:21:06] the glory of God can fall like never
[1:21:08] before you see there was not they were
[1:21:10] no longer there wasn't conditioned and
[1:21:13] he see they had to go over Jordan and
[1:21:15] brother brand he would tell us that he
[1:21:17] says before he says Jordan means death
[1:21:20] you got to die out to yourself before
[1:21:23] you can cross over that's right go over
[1:21:25] there people live in a lukewarm
[1:21:28] condition the Bible said so and so
[1:21:30] before you can go over you got to Cross
[1:21:33] Jordan which means dying to yourself and
[1:21:35] how do you die to yourself the Bible
[1:21:37] will talk about Elisha and Elijah and I
[1:21:41] won't hold you much much longer tonight
[1:21:43] but the Bible would talk about Elisha
[1:21:44] and Elijah and brother Brandon would
[1:21:46] tell us there's three stages to Elisha
[1:21:49] following Elijah right he says he
[1:21:51] followed him the gilgal then the school
[1:21:53] of the prophets then the Jordan and what
[1:21:55] I love about the story of it is the
[1:21:58] Bible would tell us that that the Lord
[1:22:00] spoke to Elijah and would say go to
[1:22:02] Elisha and anoints him to be a prophet
[1:22:04] you know and the Bible says that Elijah
[1:22:07] just walked by Elisha and threw his
[1:22:09] mantle upon him and Elisha turned around
[1:22:12] and says you wait for me let me go kiss
[1:22:15] my mother and father by and then I will
[1:22:17] follow you and the Bible says that he
[1:22:19] was he was plowing with oxen y y'all
[1:22:22] remember the story he was plowing with
[1:22:24] oxen and the Bible says when he greeted
[1:22:26] his mother and father by he went to The
[1:22:29] Oxen slew the auction and he gave it to
[1:22:32] all the people to eat brother brandom
[1:22:34] says that meant that all of the world
[1:22:36] was dead behind him so now he got one
[1:22:39] thing nothing behind him he had one one
[1:22:42] way to go that was in front of him and
[1:22:45] then the B brother Brandon would say
[1:22:47] that that was a type of Christ and the
[1:22:49] church were forsaken all that follow
[1:22:52] after him and so then the Bible I and I
[1:22:54] think it I think it's pretty neat that
[1:22:56] the Bible would tell us that Elijah
[1:22:58] would test Elisha he would say just stay
[1:23:01] here and Eli Elisha would say no as long
[1:23:04] as the Lord liveth I'm going to follow
[1:23:06] you so he would go with him to gilgal
[1:23:08] and then that he would say Elijah would
[1:23:10] say the Lord is calling me to the school
[1:23:12] of the prophets but you just stay here
[1:23:15] no as long as the Lord liveth I will
[1:23:18] follow you you see as long as there is a
[1:23:21] God alive still we should put every part
[1:23:24] of our being behind this word I've come
[1:23:27] too far to turn around I've come too far
[1:23:31] to be P to try to get warmed by a
[1:23:33] painted fire I've come too far let me
[1:23:36] see the realities of this gospel oh
[1:23:40] Hallelujah then the Bible says they went
[1:23:41] to the school of the prophets right and
[1:23:44] what is so incredible so now it's no
[1:23:46] longer the prophet testing them now
[1:23:48] there was the 50 I believe it was 50 uh
[1:23:51] 50 prophets at this school that would
[1:23:53] tell Elisha Elijah's about to leave and
[1:23:56] he's going to Jordan but he's going to
[1:23:58] die he's old and he and they were saying
[1:24:00] won't you just stay here just stay here
[1:24:02] with us and then he would say the same
[1:24:04] thing no as long as as as my soul liveth
[1:24:08] as long as there is a God I'm going to
[1:24:10] follow Elijah and the Bible says that
[1:24:14] the 50 of them were watching Elijah and
[1:24:17] Elisha at the Jordan River and that
[1:24:19] really spoke to my heart that we can do
[1:24:21] that many times too we can stop at
[1:24:24] sanctification and we're looking over
[1:24:26] there and we can see a brother following
[1:24:28] the prophet crossing the Jordan stepping
[1:24:31] into his inheritance and we're sitting
[1:24:33] over here saying come on back come on
[1:24:35] back but as long as the Lord liveth
[1:24:38] you've got a right to go over Jordan
[1:24:41] cross over and everything behind you is
[1:24:44] dead Elijah Elisha says no wayy I'll
[1:24:48] just read it to the Bible says in 2
[1:24:50] Kings 2:6 Elijah said unto him now this
[1:24:53] was right after the the the the prophets
[1:24:55] were talking to him Terry I pray thee
[1:24:58] here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan
[1:25:00] and he said as the Lord liveth and as my
[1:25:03] soul liveth I would not leave thee and
[1:25:05] the two went on and 50 men of the sons
[1:25:08] of the prophets went and stood to view a
[1:25:11] far off and they then the two stood by
[1:25:14] Jordan so here is Elisha following the
[1:25:17] prophet and all of the other ones are
[1:25:20] watching from afar oh my word not to
[1:25:22] just watch the brid's Revival we're to
[1:25:24] get into the bride's Revival we're not
[1:25:27] just to watch from afar the God is still
[1:25:30] a god of Miracles but we're to get into
[1:25:32] the Miracles and see I believe that
[1:25:35] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:25:38] and forever I'm not just watching from
[1:25:41] afar but let me be a part of it let me
[1:25:45] be a part of it and what I love about it
[1:25:47] is what would happen next after the
[1:25:50] third stage then Elijah is about to be
[1:25:53] taken away and Elijah looks at him and
[1:25:55] Elisha says what do you want you've been
[1:25:57] following me what do you want and Elisha
[1:26:00] says I want a double portion I want a
[1:26:02] double portion of what you got and what
[1:26:04] would Elijah say you've asked a hard
[1:26:06] thing oh my you've asked a hard thing
[1:26:08] but when I leave if you keep your eyes
[1:26:11] on me if you watch me when I leave you
[1:26:14] shall have it and brother brandham says
[1:26:16] Elisha never took his eyes off of Elijah
[1:26:20] he knew it was a hard thing but if he
[1:26:22] kept his eyes upon the upon the word and
[1:26:25] brother brandom says that was a type of
[1:26:27] the word he says we are to keep our eyes
[1:26:30] upon the word brother brandom would
[1:26:31] saying one place the problem of it is is
[1:26:34] we got too many too many Christians that
[1:26:37] are spiritual crosseyed he says one ey
[1:26:39] is on the world one eye is upon the word
[1:26:42] he says you can never do it that way you
[1:26:44] got to keep your eyes upon the word so
[1:26:47] as long as the Lord liveth I'm keeping
[1:26:50] my focus upon this message I don't care
[1:26:53] the family troubles I don't I'm not
[1:26:55] looking at the troubles in the church
[1:26:56] I'm not looking at at what this one's
[1:26:58] doing what that one's doing I want my
[1:27:00] double portion and as long as I can keep
[1:27:03] my eyes upon Jehovah Gyra I can receive
[1:27:07] my reward I can receive my blessing oh
[1:27:10] and what I love about the story is
[1:27:12] brother Brandon he would say that the
[1:27:14] reason we don't see things today is
[1:27:17] because we're not looking for him we're
[1:27:19] looking at our churches our
[1:27:21] denominations or our great structures
[1:27:23] how are how are we growing get your eyes
[1:27:26] off of that and look at the Messiah so
[1:27:29] quit looking at the church quit looking
[1:27:31] at this and that look at the
[1:27:34] Messiah and here the Bible would tell us
[1:27:37] that that that whenever Elijah was being
[1:27:39] called away his mantle would fall back
[1:27:42] on Elisha right I don't know it's a
[1:27:44] simple story but what I love about it
[1:27:46] was what is so significant about this
[1:27:49] mantle because we know what would happen
[1:27:52] Elijah he would grab that mantle and
[1:27:54] would hit the Jordan and the Jordan
[1:27:55] River would would would would would roll
[1:27:57] back and they would walk upon dry ground
[1:28:00] it was that very same mantel that that
[1:28:02] Elijah would throw upon Elisha and he
[1:28:04] didn't even say a word and Elisha would
[1:28:07] say I'm following you so what was so
[1:28:09] important about this mantle that that
[1:28:11] mantle would be the double portion for
[1:28:14] Elisha and and I started to look into it
[1:28:17] the very first place that that the Bible
[1:28:19] records Elijah's mantel is whenever he
[1:28:23] is in the cave he's running from je uh
[1:28:25] from Jezebel he's running for his life
[1:28:28] and he's in that cave and the Lord would
[1:28:30] come and speak right he heard the
[1:28:32] Thunder and God wasn't in the Thunder he
[1:28:34] heard the he heard the Earth or seen the
[1:28:36] earthquake and God wasn't in the
[1:28:37] earthquake he seen the he seen the fire
[1:28:40] and God wasn't in the fire but he heard
[1:28:42] a still Small Voice and God was in that
[1:28:45] voice and right after that the Bible
[1:28:47] would say in First Kings 19 and13 and it
[1:28:51] was so when Elijah heard it then he
[1:28:54] wrapped his face in his mantle and so
[1:28:57] what what got this power in this mantle
[1:29:00] was that still Small Voice and I love it
[1:29:02] cuz you look you look up the definition
[1:29:04] in the Hebrew the definition of Elijah's
[1:29:07] Mantle means Glory Splendor and
[1:29:11] magnificance you look at everybody
[1:29:13] else's everybody else's uh mantle it
[1:29:16] means cloak so what what made his mantle
[1:29:19] so different he was in the presence of
[1:29:22] that still small voice and it was that
[1:29:24] Glory that was upon Elijah that he would
[1:29:28] pass down to Elisha and he would pick up
[1:29:31] that same Glory that was upon the
[1:29:33] prophet and would say where is the god
[1:29:36] of Elijah and the god of the old was in
[1:29:39] the god of the new the God for Elijah
[1:29:41] was now the God for Elisha oh my and
[1:29:45] we're not serving a God that only worked
[1:29:47] through William brandom we're serving a
[1:29:49] god that is inside the living bride upon
[1:29:52] the Earth today we've got our double
[1:29:55] portion the glory of the Lord is rising
[1:29:57] upon us and is sheding upon the
[1:30:01] people what is this Glory it's the
[1:30:03] authority of the Holy Ghost coming
[1:30:06] inside of a people on the Earth and
[1:30:09] they're seeing the fruits of the word in
[1:30:11] their life not a pain and fire but a god
[1:30:15] of today where is the god of Elijah he
[1:30:18] wasn't afraid to put it into action
[1:30:21] where is the god of Elijah I've got his
[1:30:23] glory have got his mantle and if I got
[1:30:26] that mantle God has to do the same
[1:30:28] things for me today we need to get some
[1:30:31] ambition about ourselves where is the
[1:30:33] god of Elijah where is the god of
[1:30:35] brother Brandon where is the god of the
[1:30:37] book of Acts where is the God for all of
[1:30:40] these Elders if he is your God we can
[1:30:42] see that same Supernatural and New Life
[1:30:45] Outreach come on now if he's your God
[1:30:48] our expectation is I'm going to see a
[1:30:52] Revival like never before for and I'm
[1:30:55] going to get into that
[1:30:57] atmosphere oh come on cuz if you really
[1:31:00] if you don't believe that he's your God
[1:31:02] you're not going to ask anything for it
[1:31:05] right the Bible would say you have not
[1:31:07] because you ask not come on now the
[1:31:09] Bible would say uh uh ask abundantly
[1:31:12] that your joy may be full you see you're
[1:31:15] not going to ask if you don't think he's
[1:31:18] your God but if you know he's your God
[1:31:21] ask for big things brother brand going
[1:31:23] say that ask ask for big things maybe it
[1:31:25] seems like it's a hard thing to see your
[1:31:28] children on fire with the Holy Ghost but
[1:31:30] ask for it keep your eyes upon the word
[1:31:34] you see the brother Brandon he he would
[1:31:36] talk about Elisha and would say the
[1:31:38] reason that God called Elisha was
[1:31:40] because he would plow with oxen and he
[1:31:43] knew that that he knew how to appreciate
[1:31:46] straight roads and he knew if he looked
[1:31:48] back he says he would wiggle off of the
[1:31:51] road Oh my he knew that he how to keep
[1:31:54] his eyes not on what Elijah can do but
[1:31:57] what can I do you see we're not looking
[1:32:00] for a prophet to come upon the Earth and
[1:32:02] ride the trail again you know we are
[1:32:04] riding that trail we are the
[1:32:07] manifestation of the word in this hour
[1:32:10] the Bible would say forgetting those
[1:32:12] things which are behind you and we press
[1:32:14] towards the Mark we're not turning
[1:32:17] around and saying man I wish I was with
[1:32:19] brother brandom but the same Angel of
[1:32:21] the Lord that was with brother brandom
[1:32:23] is here today oh Elijah or Elisha he was
[1:32:28] used to plowing he knew if he looked
[1:32:30] behind he was going to end up over here
[1:32:33] or over there but he had to keep his
[1:32:35] eyes straight on the prize we're not
[1:32:38] looking behind us at a pain and fire
[1:32:40] we're looking today at the realities of
[1:32:43] the spirit of God oh come on now I'm not
[1:32:46] looking at a youth camp of 10 years ago
[1:32:48] or or when I got the Holy Ghost whenever
[1:32:50] I was 14 there there in Gaya Virginia
[1:32:53] I'm thankful for that but what can God
[1:32:55] do for me today come on now brother
[1:32:58] Brandon would say that whenever the the
[1:33:00] the prophets try to get Elisha to stay
[1:33:03] there but the brandom says he had
[1:33:05] experienced that power and he knew there
[1:33:08] was more for him so if he knew there was
[1:33:10] more for him he was not going to settle
[1:33:13] for anything less and if you know there
[1:33:16] was more for you don't settle for
[1:33:18] anything less but keep on
[1:33:21] persevering oh Hallelujah I'm not
[1:33:24] settling for anything less I am
[1:33:27] persevering we've tasted of the good
[1:33:29] things of God and we know what we've
[1:33:31] tasted up we can continue to eat on oh
[1:33:35] Hallelujah that's why we know that this
[1:33:37] message is the truth we've experienced
[1:33:39] that power we've experienced it and and
[1:33:43] I know I've read this this scripture
[1:33:44] before but but I just love it Isaiah 52
[1:33:47] and one awake awake and put on thy
[1:33:50] strength o Zion put on thy beautiful
[1:33:52] garments oh Jerusalem oh holy city for
[1:33:55] henceforth there shall no more come into
[1:33:57] Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean
[1:34:00] Shake thyself from the dust and arise
[1:34:04] Shake thyself from the dust Shake
[1:34:06] thyself from your humanity and put on
[1:34:09] his glory put on his strength the Bible
[1:34:13] would say let us therefore cast off the
[1:34:15] works of darkness and let us put on the
[1:34:18] armor of the light but the Brandon would
[1:34:20] say we've been invited to share his
[1:34:23] glory we've been invited you as I was
[1:34:25] saying on Wednesday that Jesus lived in
[1:34:28] a world that the disciples knew nothing
[1:34:30] about the disciples had had they were
[1:34:32] confused whenever Jesus would talk but
[1:34:35] you've been invited into this place that
[1:34:38] the disciples knew nothing about you've
[1:34:40] been invited to step into his glory and
[1:34:43] see the manifestation of the word of God
[1:34:46] brother Brandon would say we've been
[1:34:48] claimed by his glory in one place he
[1:34:51] would say we've been brought out of the
[1:34:52] devil's pwn sh and claimed by the glory
[1:34:56] of Jesus Christ he would say in one
[1:34:57] place that the that the weakest hands
[1:35:00] the feeblest of hands have to testify of
[1:35:03] the glory of God you see that's what
[1:35:05] happens when we are claimed when we're
[1:35:08] conditioned for the in the right
[1:35:10] atmosphere even the weak have to say I
[1:35:12] am strong even the poor have to say I am
[1:35:15] rich even the ones that is discouraged
[1:35:17] have to say I am encouraged we've been
[1:35:20] claimed by the glory of God you see the
[1:35:23] devil want had a claim on every one of
[1:35:25] our lives but Christ would break that
[1:35:27] claim and then seal us to the day of our
[1:35:30] Redemption that the devil had no more
[1:35:32] claims Upon Our Lives Hallelujah the
[1:35:36] voice of the groom is now in the bride
[1:35:39] what is it whatever Elisha and brother
[1:35:41] Brandon would say it was a double
[1:35:42] portion he said Elijah done eight
[1:35:44] Miracles Elisha done 16 Miracles it was
[1:35:47] a double portion and and brother Brandon
[1:35:49] then would say that we're a continuation
[1:35:51] of the ministry of Christ he said says
[1:35:53] the church will be honed in such a
[1:35:56] condition you see we got to be
[1:35:58] conditioned for this we will be honed in
[1:36:00] such a condition till the church's
[1:36:02] ministry will be so close and be just
[1:36:06] exactly the kind of ministry that Jesus
[1:36:09] had you speak under this mountain and
[1:36:12] doubt not and it will happen as you say
[1:36:14] it oh hallelujah we're doing the Greater
[1:36:17] Works brother Brandon would say because
[1:36:19] it has to be because a woman and her
[1:36:21] husband has become one they become one
[1:36:24] and so does the bride and Christ become
[1:36:26] one the ministry of the bride and the
[1:36:29] ministry of Christ is the same you shall
[1:36:33] prophesy again remember John you're a
[1:36:35] type of John the angel would tell John
[1:36:37] go to that Mighty angel with an open
[1:36:39] book in hand and say give me that book
[1:36:42] you eat the book it shall be sweet in
[1:36:44] your mouth bitter in your tummy but then
[1:36:46] you're going to prophesy again what was
[1:36:48] it the voice of the groom was now in the
[1:36:51] bride what the groom said the bride is
[1:36:54] saying oh my that's what brother Brandon
[1:36:56] would say let no negative confession
[1:36:58] come out of your mouth cuz now that that
[1:37:00] ain't lining up with scripture whatever
[1:37:02] is lining up with scripture you say it
[1:37:05] negativity ain't lining up with
[1:37:07] scripture but you are you you got the
[1:37:09] voice of the groom inside of your mouth
[1:37:12] you speak the word you speak and create
[1:37:16] change the atmosphere you speak the
[1:37:19] Bible would say Peter and John would say
[1:37:21] Silver and Gold Have I None but what are
[1:37:23] I do have rise up and walk the Bible
[1:37:26] would say they that people looked at
[1:37:27] them and says they're ignorant and
[1:37:29] unlearned but had to take notice that
[1:37:32] they had been with Jesus what was it the
[1:37:34] glory of Christ was now upon Peter and
[1:37:37] John oh my and the glory of Christ is
[1:37:40] resting upon us let our musicians come
[1:37:43] tonight he would say see the token was
[1:37:45] there display such as I have seeing a
[1:37:48] poor fell laying there crippled and
[1:37:50] disfigured and everything and the same
[1:37:53] line that was in Christ was in them such
[1:37:56] as I have in the name in my name you
[1:38:00] shall cast out devils not I will you
[1:38:03] will if you say to this mountain not if
[1:38:05] I say if you say to this mountain I
[1:38:09] believe all spiritual blessings have
[1:38:12] been given to us if we can get
[1:38:14] conditioned right oh come on church if
[1:38:17] we can just get conditioned right and
[1:38:20] and I hope this has been okay these last
[1:38:21] couple services
[1:38:23] you know it's like like I was saying on
[1:38:26] Wednesday brother Brandon and
[1:38:28] perseverance says before you can
[1:38:30] persevere you got to know what you're
[1:38:33] after you can get you see too many times
[1:38:36] we don't think we can actually get it so
[1:38:38] we don't persevere for it but let me say
