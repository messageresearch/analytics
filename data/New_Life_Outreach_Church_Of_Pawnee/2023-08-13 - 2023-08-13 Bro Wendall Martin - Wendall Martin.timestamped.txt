[1:09:50] inherit the promises
[1:09:52] for when God made promise to Abraham
[1:09:55] because he could swear by no greater
[1:09:58] he swear by himself
[1:10:01] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:10:03] multiplying I will multiply thee
[1:10:06] and so after he had patiently endured he
[1:10:10] obtained the promise
[1:10:11] for men verily swear by the greater and
[1:10:16] an oath for confirmation is to them and
[1:10:18] end of all strife
[1:10:20] wherein God more a willing more
[1:10:23] abundantly to show Into The Heirs of the
[1:10:25] promise the immutability of his counsel

[1:10:31] things in which it was impossible for
[1:10:33] God to lie we might have a strong
[1:10:36] consolation who have fled for Refuge to
[1:10:39] lay hold upon the Hope set before us
[1:10:42] which hope will you have as an anchor of
[1:10:45] the Soul both sure instead fast which in
[1:10:48] Earth into that within the Veil
[1:10:50] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[1:10:53] even Jesus made in high priest Forever
[1:10:56] After the order of Melchizedek let's go
[1:11:00] to the Lord in prayer father we want to
[1:11:02] thank you today for your love
[1:11:04] thank you for your grace Upon Our Lives
[1:11:06] Lord
[1:11:07] thank you for this service and Lord the
[1:11:10] songs of Zion that have been sung
[1:11:12] the prayers that have been prayed
[1:11:15] Lord we have lifted our voices and our
[1:11:18] hearts unto you
[1:11:19] but Lord we're asking that you would
[1:11:21] speak to us this morning
[1:11:24] that your presence would be here with us
[1:11:26] in a real special way
[1:11:28] and I'm asking Lord that the Holy Spirit
[1:11:32] would just meet every need
[1:11:35] Lord you see Robin
[1:11:37] the father wanted to come and be prayed
[1:11:39] for Lord and
[1:11:41] father you see how he's had to leave and
[1:11:44] I'm asking the Lord that you would
[1:11:46] go with him
[1:11:48] Lord that you would touch him
[1:11:50] Lord and Body Spirit and soul
[1:11:54] Lord that you would curse those things
[1:11:56] that are trying to destroy him Lord
[1:11:59] and that you would bring healing to Him
[1:12:01] Father
[1:12:02] let him know you today in a in a greater
[1:12:05] way than ever before
[1:12:07] we give you glory and honor in the name
[1:12:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:11] can the Church Say Amen
[1:12:14] and a man praise the Lord hallelujah so
[1:12:19] we're we're thankful tonight for this
[1:12:21] morning for his love and if you give me
[1:12:23] a little more monitors up here on the on
[1:12:25] the um
[1:12:26] on these monitors platform
[1:12:28] I want to speak this morning the anchor
[1:12:31] holds
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:33] I want to say there's going to be a
[1:12:35] rapture
[1:12:36] in spite of laodicea
[1:12:39] there's going to be God's word will be
[1:12:42] fulfilled amen regardless of what takes
[1:12:47] place we have an anchor amen we have an
[1:12:52] anchor so there's there's two immutable
[1:12:54] things that God was going to give us as
[1:12:58] an anchor amen the first immutable thing
[1:13:01] is every word of God is true won't you
[1:13:04] turn to your neighbor and say every word
[1:13:07] of God is true amen that's the first
[1:13:12] immutable thing God gave the promise
[1:13:16] amen and it was just as good as
[1:13:20] fulfilled right then and there because
[1:13:23] God simply cannot change his mind he he
[1:13:28] and he is sure cannot lie can you say
[1:13:30] Amen the second immutable thing is God
[1:13:33] confirmed it with an oath now amen so he
[1:13:38] his words are true so when he gives a
[1:13:42] promise it cannot change and then God
[1:13:47] confirmed it with an oath now the Bible
[1:13:50] says that he could not swear by anyone
[1:13:54] or anything greater because he was God
[1:13:57] there is no greater so he swore by
[1:14:01] himself now today amen
[1:14:04] isn't it you know we we would consider
[1:14:07] it a contract amen we signed
[1:14:11] contracts
[1:14:13] that have the weight of the law behind
[1:14:15] them amen if you renege on your on your
[1:14:19] contract you will face legal action
[1:14:21] because the amen it is it is a it is a
[1:14:26] signed contract it has been notarized it
[1:14:28] has been amen uh it has been declared as
[1:14:32] official and so the contract you you
[1:14:37] will amen uh you you keep the contract
[1:14:40] you're into the contract or you'll man
[1:14:43] go before a judge amen now today you
[1:14:47] know words aren't aren't as important as
[1:14:51] as what they were uh in the Bible days
[1:14:53] now but in the Bible days amen men swore
[1:14:57] they would swear in the name of God
[1:14:59] they're Gods they would swear in the
[1:15:01] name of of a a Caesar or the a great man
[1:15:06] they would amen and so they would they
[1:15:09] would swear in the name of someone
[1:15:11] greater that would require it of him if
[1:15:16] he were to break that promise amen so
[1:15:19] the Oaths take it in the name of the
[1:15:22] greater person they were not broken amen
[1:15:25] because of the fear of the retribution
[1:15:28] that would come amen from that one uh
[1:15:32] who did not uh fulfill the promise is
[1:15:35] that right
[1:15:36] you understand what I'm saying so they
[1:15:38] would so when the Apostle Paul was
[1:15:40] saying amen he could swear by no greater
[1:15:43] so he swore by himself
[1:15:48] amen now I I I liked it when God says I
[1:15:52] swore by myself what an allegiance I I
[1:15:55] will swear by my Majestic name I will I
[1:16:00] will swear I am the author of all truth
[1:16:04] I am the author of all honesty I am the
[1:16:08] Fountain of all integrity and I give of
[1:16:12] my own character my word hallelujah I
[1:16:17] give you my promise and I swear by my
[1:16:19] own righteousness I'm now now God's not
[1:16:22] doing this to hold himself responsible
[1:16:26] now now men do it amen they write the
[1:16:29] contract to hold each other responsible
[1:16:33] but God's not drawing this up to hold
[1:16:36] himself responsible he's not afraid that
[1:16:39] he might renege on the promise he is
[1:16:42] drawing it up so that you know that he
[1:16:46] will keep his word
[1:16:50] Hallelujah this morning oh we don't we
[1:16:53] don't have to say I I I I hope God keeps
[1:16:55] his end of the deal God says I'm going
[1:16:57] to keep my end of the deal and I am
[1:17:00] going to give you my word and I'm going
[1:17:04] to give I have proved it by Jesus Christ

[1:17:12] tempted to break his word this morning

[1:17:16] God God doesn't have temptations amen
[1:17:18] God's not tempted to amen Almighty I
[1:17:21] didn't see this happening God I it's not
[1:17:23] saying I just don't understand or I
[1:17:25] don't know or I didn't understand her I
[1:17:26] didn't know amen but God's got his word
[1:17:29] and his word is still anchored and his
[1:17:30] word is still true his word is still
[1:17:33] alive his word amen is is just as good
[1:17:36] today as it ever was can I hear a great
[1:17:39] big amen God cannot lie amen there's one
[1:17:44] there's two things that will never

[1:18:41] weapon amen it is something that God has
[1:18:44] given to you so that you can rise or can

[1:18:54] fear no evil for thou art with me amen
[1:18:59] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me

[1:30:50] praise the Lord
[1:30:52] to get the anchor enlarged after it's
[1:30:54] gone down hundreds of feet and hooked
[1:30:56] into a rock or the
[1:30:58] they say what you've got to do is you've
[1:30:59] got to do a sweeping turn
[1:31:02] and go the opposite direction
[1:31:06] Hallelujah
[1:31:09] so if you're turning and you're going
[1:31:11] the opposite direction your anchor can't
[1:31:14] hold you
[1:31:16] you've got praise the Lord
[1:31:19] many are the afflictions of the
[1:31:20] righteous but the Lord delivers them out
[1:31:22] of them all
[1:31:24] well come on
[1:31:25] but for those guys that'll turn around
[1:31:27] and walk away from this message and say
[1:31:29] they don't need it anymore it's no
[1:31:31] wonder amen there is a big percentage of
[1:31:34] them I I I have heard that there is like
[1:31:37] a 20 30 percentage a percentile of of of
[1:31:42] of of of message believers who have left
[1:31:45] the message who have become
[1:31:47] homosexuality uh homosexuals and
[1:31:49] lesbians
[1:31:50] because the anchor no longer holds
[1:31:55] they've walked away they have loosened
[1:31:59] well praise the Lord why is it that the
[1:32:01] preacher is preaching constantly every
[1:32:03] service stick with the word it don't
[1:32:05] matter what you think it don't matter
[1:32:07] amen you're at what your attitudes are
[1:32:09] it don't matter uh you know how you see
[1:32:12] things it's what the Bible says because
[1:32:14] the Bible cannot change you might have
[1:32:17] your own views you might have your own
[1:32:19] attitudes you might say and the whole
[1:32:21] world may see it that way but brother I
[1:32:24] want to tell you what they don't see is
[1:32:27] you've got an anchor that is securing
[1:32:30] you oh when you should be a statistic
[1:32:33] here you sit here this morning and
[1:32:35] you're blast when you should be in
[1:32:38] misery you're sitting here this morning
[1:32:39] in your blast oh come on church amen
[1:32:43] lastly Odyssey or they're out there amen
[1:32:45] and they let you do whatever you want to
[1:32:47] do and amen they've got their you know
[1:32:49] their suppers and they've got all their
[1:32:52] games and their programs and they've got
[1:32:54] all of that but brother where's their
[1:32:56] anchor where's their anchor but I have
[1:33:00] an anchor of my soul it's Jesus Christ
[1:33:05] the word
[1:33:07] can you say Amen
[1:33:10] yes sir now amen
[1:33:14] therein when you look
[1:33:16] Hallelujah name man when you look there
[1:33:19] at Abraham the Bible said
[1:33:20] but in due time
[1:33:22] Abraham obtained the promise
[1:33:25] Abraham obtained the promise now I I
[1:33:28] want you to I want you to look at that
[1:33:30] the oath was given
[1:33:33] the anchor held
[1:33:36] until the promise came that was 25 long
[1:33:41] years
[1:33:43] and I want to tell you amen hallelujah
[1:33:46] there there's there's no changing
[1:33:48] there's no many times there's there's
[1:33:50] intervals
[1:33:52] amen there's intervals between the
[1:33:55] promise and the performance
[1:33:57] many times there's a delay between the
[1:34:01] promise and the Fulfillment amen so so
[1:34:04] just because God gives a promise and it
[1:34:08] doesn't happen immediately does not mean
[1:34:11] a man that that that God's word is not
[1:34:15] true that is why you've got the anchor
[1:34:19] because your faith is going to be tested
[1:34:26] Hallelujah the Bible says it's not him
[1:34:28] that starts in the race
[1:34:30] it's not him that runs the fastest but
[1:34:33] it's him that endures
[1:34:35] to the end
[1:34:37] and if you don't want your ship falling
[1:34:39] apart you don't want to be wrecked you
[1:34:41] don't want to be destroyed you've got to
[1:34:44] have an anchor
[1:34:46] praise the Lord amen God gave the
[1:34:49] promise to Abraham he gave that promise
[1:34:51] he gave his word Abraham had to stand by
[1:34:57] faith upon that word no one could see a
[1:35:00] physical rope tied to him no one could
[1:35:03] see a physical anchor but he anchored
[1:35:06] his soul upon that word
[1:35:10] it didn't matter what it looked like it
[1:35:12] didn't matter that Sarah was Barren it
[1:35:14] didn't always bear it it didn't matter
[1:35:16] that he was dead it did not matter What
[1:35:20] mattered God gave the promise and he was
[1:35:24] hooked to it
[1:35:26] well praise the Lord
[1:35:28] you know why God does that because in
[1:35:30] the delay is where you find where you're
[1:35:33] anger is in the delay is where you find
[1:35:36] where your faith is hallelujah amen yes
[1:35:39] there's always an interval there's
[1:35:42] always a time between the promise and
[1:35:46] the performance sometimes the interval
[1:35:48] can be quite lengthy because God's time

[1:40:28] gods in your life there's been so many
[1:40:31] times but God stood in there's been so
[1:40:33] many situations but God stepped up
[1:40:37] there's been so many of those times
[1:40:40] where God stepped in
[1:40:44] Hallelujah
[1:40:45] can you say man
[1:40:47] amen when when when when Abraham
[1:40:51] Hallelujah
[1:40:52] when he had sort of when he was was
[1:40:56] throwing his wife at the king
[1:40:58] he meant for his own skin amen he says
[1:41:01] now listen you're pretty that guy's
[1:41:03] gonna that guy's going that guy's gonna

[1:41:12] he can have you but I want to live
[1:41:14] praise the Lord and so
[1:41:18] and he and he takes it and he's going to
[1:41:20] marry her hey man is going to make her
[1:41:22] one of well you know want one of his
[1:41:24] Harem there and and and and but what did
[1:41:27] God what what did scripture say but God
[1:41:31] God's step God gave the dream and God
[1:41:34] says that man's wife
[1:41:37] uh you've got another man's wife
[1:41:42] you know why
[1:41:45] because God gave the promise
[1:41:47] and God was anchored to that promise
[1:41:50] you're anchored to that promise God had
[1:41:53] already said that Abraham and Sarah was
[1:41:55] going to have a baby oh come on Church
[1:41:57] the circumstances were trying to pull
[1:42:01] her away and listen it looked like it
[1:42:05] was all but done and God stepped in and
[1:42:09] said no I've done given my word as the
[1:42:13] anchor
[1:42:15] or if we could rely on predestination I
[1:42:17] think we could go through we could go
[1:42:19] through life a little bit easier if we
[1:42:21] could realize that the purpose of God in
[1:42:23] our lives is going to be fulfilled amen
[1:42:25] if you could rely upon God and say I've
[1:42:28] been placed here upon Earth for a
[1:42:31] purpose and there is nothing that is
[1:42:33] going to take that purpose from me I
[1:42:36] can't die until that purpose is done I
[1:42:38] can't be defeated until that purpose is
[1:42:40] done I cannot lie because there is a
[1:42:43] predestinated word concerning me I might
[1:42:46] not have life like others I might not
[1:42:49] see things like colors but I
[1:42:54] the whole Church of the Living God
[1:42:56] you've got a purpose amen if you're
[1:42:58] still sitting in this church here this
[1:42:59] morning you got a purpose if you're
[1:43:01] still alive you have a purpose
[1:43:06] praise the Lord
[1:43:08] now
[1:43:09] man the delay
[1:43:11] the delay sometimes can
[1:43:14] an interval is a pause or break in
[1:43:18] activity
[1:43:19] man interval is is an intermission
[1:43:22] separating parts of a theatrical or
[1:43:24] musical performance
[1:43:26] man interval is a delay or a lingering
[1:43:29] it's a an interval or a gap between one
[1:43:33] vent to another
[1:43:34] it's the space between two things can
[1:43:37] you say man in the interval it doesn't
[1:43:40] seem to be too much happening
[1:43:43] in fact it just seems like
[1:43:46] amen it just seems like maybe God's
[1:43:49] forgot about his word and the devil's
[1:43:51] just having a Heyday is that right
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:55] Hallelujah Malachi he was the last of
[1:43:57] the of the prophets of the Old Testament
[1:44:00] and Malachi had stood up and said behold
[1:44:04] I send my messenger before my face
[1:44:05] Malachi 3 amen and he shall prepare the
[1:44:08] way before me
[1:44:09] and then the Lord whom you seek shall
[1:44:11] suddenly appear in his Temple or is that
[1:44:15] word suddenly again amen even the
[1:44:17] messenger of the Covenant who shall
[1:44:19] abide and then he asks who shall abide
[1:44:22] in the day of his coming
[1:44:23] who shall stand when he appears he shall
[1:44:26] be like a Refiner's Fire in a fuller
[1:44:29] soap oh my everyone's all saying all the
[1:44:32] Messiah is fixing to come we're here
[1:44:35] and then it was 400 years

[1:44:42] you're not hearing God speak there's no
[1:44:45] prophets in the Land There is nothing
[1:44:49] Malachi has just said he's coming he's
[1:44:53] coming he's coming he's coming
[1:44:57] and everyone's looking
[1:44:58] 400 years later

[1:45:04] 400 year Delay from Malachi to Jesus
[1:45:08] there was silence
[1:45:10] are y'all understand Hallelujah
[1:45:13] sometimes you think that God forgot
[1:45:17] about you and that God's forgot about
[1:45:19] his promise and you're praying and
[1:45:22] you're not getting your answer and
[1:45:23] you're studying and you ain't feeling no
[1:45:25] tingles up and down your spine that's
[1:45:28] when you've got to know that you're
[1:45:32] anchored
[1:45:36] well praise the Lord
[1:45:38] oh in Pentecost we was just always
[1:45:40] looking for somebody to lay hands on us
[1:45:42] and prophesy

[1:45:51] didn't care if it's good or bad I just
[1:45:53] wanted to know that God would knew about
[1:45:55] me and then hallelujah but now that I've
[1:45:57] grown up a little bit my Anchor's not in
[1:45:59] Prophecy prophecies will fail my anchor

[1:46:07] and I'm thankful I'm thankful for joy
[1:46:09] and I'm thankful for but I want to tell
[1:46:11] you there's only one thing that's going
[1:46:12] to keep me there's only one thing that's
[1:46:14] going to secure me that's the word of
[1:46:16] God can you say amen and when everything
[1:46:19] was up and down in every which direction
[1:46:20] and and and and so it had been there
[1:46:23] wasn't a peep from God there wasn't
[1:46:24] there wasn't a hint there wasn't a sound
[1:46:26] there wasn't anything and then suddenly
[1:46:30] suddenly appears Zach an angel appears
[1:46:34] unto Zechariah and then on then and then
[1:46:37] boom Here Comes an angel appearing to
[1:46:38] Mary Zechariah was told you're going to
[1:46:41] have a son he's going to be a prophet

[1:46:48] of God among women amen here it comes
[1:46:52] Angelic visitation to Joseph an angel
[1:46:55] visits Joseph and tells Joseph amen this
[1:46:58] this this this this a child that that is
[1:47:01] within Mary fear not amen it's from the
[1:47:04] Holy Ghost she didn't she wasn't lying
[1:47:06] around with somebody else amen and then
[1:47:08] there was visitations to Simeon and
[1:47:11] there was a visitation to Anna and God
[1:47:13] was telling them you're not going to die
[1:47:15] until you see the Lord's Messiah you're
[1:47:18] not going to die Hallelujah and then all
[1:47:20] of a sudden now the inner War went for
[1:47:22] 400 years and now there's Angels showing
[1:47:25] up everywhere there's Angels showing up
[1:47:27] here there's Angels showing up there
[1:47:28] amen what was it it was time for the
[1:47:31] word to be fulfilled well y'all ain't

[1:47:35] appeared unto the shepherds in the field
[1:47:38] the pillar of fire appears unto the
[1:47:41] magias as they are out there looking
[1:47:47] can you say Amen oh and this baby's born
[1:47:51] everyone's excited I mean the Shepherds
[1:47:53] have already declared it Mary is excited
[1:47:57] everyone's excited angels have been
[1:48:00] appearing everywhere
[1:48:06] and then they disappear
[1:48:10] and there is silence
[1:48:13] for 12 years
[1:48:16] you don't read nothing more of Jesus
[1:48:19] there ain't no Angels appearing to him
[1:48:21] anymore
[1:48:22] praise the Lord
[1:48:26] and about that time they're looking back
[1:48:27] think was this real
[1:48:29] was this was was
[1:48:33] did that really happen
[1:48:35] maybe the Shepherds were saying
[1:48:37] were those really angels that appeared
[1:48:39] or was that in our imagination
[1:48:41] maybe Simeon would say
[1:48:44] was I sure come on
[1:48:47] you say huh no they didn't think that
[1:48:49] the the Bible said John
[1:48:52] John the prophet when he was in jail
[1:48:55] John the prayer Prophet sent his sent
[1:48:58] his followers and said hey go ask him
[1:49:00] are you the Messiah or are we still
[1:49:02] looking for this was the one who saw the
[1:49:05] pillar of Fire coming down on Jesus
[1:49:08] and John in his trial is now asking
[1:49:16] well praise the Lord can you say Amen so
[1:49:19] it went for 12 years 12 years amen

[1:49:37] his understanding of scriptures wow this
[1:49:39] kid this kid's amazing and then all of a
[1:49:41] sudden nothing else in Scripture

[1:49:47] she shows up to the River Jordan amen at
[1:49:50] the age of 30.
[1:49:52] 18 years later

[1:49:56] catching my drift he was the living
[1:49:59] promise the promise was there but there
[1:50:01] was a delay there was an interval there
[1:50:04] was there was a
[1:50:07] could this be something else God does
[1:50:09] things in a way to where you have to
[1:50:13] trust him

[1:50:18] here he is we don't hear nothing nothing
[1:50:21] nothing nothing eight
[1:50:23] eight in years
[1:50:27] and then John the Baptist comes out of
[1:50:29] the wilderness
[1:50:32] John the Baptist his mom and dad dies
[1:50:34] when he's about eight or nine years old
[1:50:36] and he goes out in the wilderness amen
[1:50:39] he didn't he didn't have no parents take
[1:50:40] him in or nothing he just went out in
[1:50:41] the wilderness
[1:50:42] no one knew anything about John he's
[1:50:44] just a poor kid that that died somewhere
[1:50:46] out he just reported he did he he had a
[1:50:49] heart heartbreak with his mom and dad
[1:50:50] when they died and then and then all of
[1:50:52] a sudden Here Comes this guy
[1:50:55] hair hanging down hat and shaved or
[1:50:57] taking a bath every six months amen he
[1:51:00] he was he was he was eating wild locusts
[1:51:03] and honey he was hairy all over he was
[1:51:06] draped in sheepskin and he comes walking
[1:51:09] out Hallelujah and he
[1:51:13] and he goes out there and begins to to
[1:51:15] say I am
[1:51:17] The Voice crying in the wilderness out
[1:51:19] of the Wilderness I'm the voice prepare
[1:51:22] ye the way of the Lord and everyone's
[1:51:24] looking at John the Baptist thinking
[1:51:27] are you nuts
[1:51:29] if this is the Messiah man this is
[1:51:32] really messed up man this this this this
[1:51:34] this whole thing has been cooped up from
[1:51:35] the very beginning this is insane hey
[1:51:38] man he's out there baptizing hey man
[1:51:41] he's out there and and now I mean John
[1:51:43] John's preaching a message to him
[1:51:45] Hallelujah and and he's and he's going
[1:51:48] he says repent
[1:51:49] ye for the king of Heaven is at hand the
[1:51:52] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:51:54] John the Baptist we have to hollering
[1:51:55] Orient generations of vipers who have
[1:51:58] warned you to flee the Wrath to come
[1:52:00] bring forth meat fruit for repentance
[1:52:04] amen and then all of a sudden Here Comes
[1:52:08] Jesus as he's now he's baptizing and
[1:52:10] then all of a sudden when he looked
[1:52:11] there at Jesus his heart began to throb
[1:52:15] amen
[1:52:17] and then the light comes down upon him
[1:52:19] he says behind
[1:52:21] the Lamb of God which taketh away the
[1:52:24] sin of the world
[1:52:26] God fulfilling his word God the promise
[1:52:31] of all of the Old Testament was right
[1:52:33] there
[1:52:34] for a 30-year period
[1:52:37] you would think it would be 30 years of
[1:52:40] great celebration but it wasn't
[1:52:45] only the elect who was tied to the
[1:52:48] promise
[1:52:49] was going to stay with it
[1:52:52] come on now
[1:52:53] now only that elect that was tied to the
[1:52:55] promise
[1:52:57] the rest of the world didn't sit
[1:53:01] only a sixteenth of a sixteenth percent
[1:53:04] that even knew Jesus was on the Earth
[1:53:08] let alone believe him
[1:53:10] but that elect that had a predestinated
[1:53:12] anchor in their heart that was
[1:53:13] predestined it didn't matter what the
[1:53:15] world said it didn't matter what they
[1:53:17] said
[1:53:17] they knew the word had gave the promise
[1:53:22] and God was going to fulfill that
[1:53:26] promise
[1:53:28] well glory to God
[1:53:32] you see what I mean you anchor you
[1:53:35] anchor yourself to that promise oh
[1:53:38] praise the Lord amen anchor don't you
[1:53:41] don't you turn to the left or the right
[1:53:42] don't you look around
[1:53:44] amen and expect something else but you
[1:53:47] stand there upon the promises of God
[1:53:49] Amen are you hearing me stand upon the
[1:53:52] promises of God and then all of a sudden
[1:53:55] 30 years at three years of his ministry
[1:53:57] amen three years of his ministry he's
[1:53:59] Healing The Sick and he's casting out
[1:54:01] devils and and he's and he's doing these
[1:54:03] things let me let me let me just say
[1:54:06] this right here Amen in your situation
[1:54:09] sometimes God gets more Glory taking you
[1:54:13] through the trial than taking you out of
[1:54:16] the trial
[1:54:17] sometimes God receives more honor amen
[1:54:22] by being your anchor in the storm
[1:54:29] then he does when he speaks to the storm
[1:54:34] hallelujah amen hallelujah now the Volvo
[1:54:37] Pentecost now if if those three Hebrew
[1:54:40] boys were Pentecostals hallelujah amen
[1:54:43] that have been right there and they'd
[1:54:45] say Amen we we speak to that with that
[1:54:48] fire in the name of Jesus fire be put
[1:54:50] out and we curse the king in the name of
[1:54:53] Jesus and we'd be doing all of our
[1:54:54] prophesying and all of those kinds of
[1:54:56] things but you see Hallelujah there was
[1:54:59] an anchor that was going to hold them
[1:55:04] Hallelujah he gets more Glory can you
[1:55:07] say man
[1:55:08] hallelujah oh yes look at Joseph
[1:55:11] given the promise Joseph having that
[1:55:14] little something on the other on the
[1:55:15] other side Joseph was so predestinated
[1:55:18] he had no other choice but to go through
[1:55:22] Joseph had a soul that was so ordained
[1:55:25] of God his Destiny was so wrapped up in
[1:55:28] the word of God can you say Amen the
[1:55:31] footsteps of a good man are ordered of
[1:55:34] the Lord
[1:55:36] God foreseen God declared and God
[1:55:41] equipped Joseph
[1:55:42] for his birth before his birth can you
[1:55:45] say Amen
[1:55:46] amen he foreseen his jealous Brothers
[1:55:49] amen he foreseen the LIE
[1:55:53] from Potiphar's wife he he foreseen
[1:55:56] named man I went from the live part of
[1:55:59] his wife to being thrown in prison to
[1:56:01] being Forgot by the man who he had
[1:56:04] helped while in the prison hallelujah
[1:56:06] amen but God had already given the
[1:56:08] promise Joseph you're going to rain I
[1:56:11] want to tell you right now Satan may be
[1:56:12] beating you pulling you you know
[1:56:15] bringing you trying to bring you into
[1:56:16] lukewarm layout of see you this that and
[1:56:18] the other God has already got your name
[1:56:20] Amen in in Destiny it's already an
[1:56:24] infamy it's already declared it's
[1:56:26] already there Christ is there your name
[1:56:29] is in him

[1:56:33] there's no way that you're going to move
[1:56:36] there's no way you're going to lose you
[1:56:38] are as predestinated as Joseph was
[1:56:40] predestinated
[1:56:43] then you say man
[1:56:44] yes that's right you're going to rain
[1:56:46] Joseph but there's going to be an
[1:56:48] interval there's going to be a delay and
[1:56:50] then that delay is going to be the
[1:56:51] testing of your faith but I want you to
[1:56:53] know no weapon formed against you is
[1:56:55] going to prosper because I have ordained
[1:56:57] it I have brought you out you are tied
[1:57:00] to me not because you tied yourself to
[1:57:03] me the ship is not a man the safe place
[1:57:07] the anchor is doing the job without the
[1:57:11] anchor the ship has no ability God gave
[1:57:14] you an anchor for your ship
[1:57:21] isn't cresting the waves the anchors
[1:57:23] causing you to stand solid today
[1:57:27] amen
[1:57:29] Moses life was ordained to be a
[1:57:31] deliverer
[1:57:33] now now now again going back to Joseph
[1:57:35] went for years and years and years and
[1:57:38] years
[1:57:40] and here comes Moses Moses life it was
[1:57:43] ordained to be a deliverer he was born a
[1:57:46] deliverer
[1:57:48] yet he lived as Pharaoh's son in the
[1:57:51] palace
[1:57:52] he was not a Slave at all Joseph was or
[1:57:54] Moses was not a Slave
[1:57:57] Hallelujah in fact he was in next in
[1:57:59] line to the throne
[1:58:01] now if you
[1:58:04] it just don't make much sense
[1:58:07] it don't make but yet the call to be the
[1:58:11] deliverer was in him and it drove him
[1:58:16] from the palace
[1:58:21] most of us are trying to get to the
[1:58:24] riches we're trying to get to the good
[1:58:27] job we're trying to get to the the easy
[1:58:30] way of life
[1:58:32] Joseph or Mars that's because of the
[1:58:35] call within him
[1:58:38] born with a silver spoon in his mouth
[1:58:42] had everything going for him next in
[1:58:45] line
[1:58:49] Moses forsook his riches
[1:58:54] to be a Slave
[1:58:59] Moses forsook his riches they're in
[1:59:03] they're in Hebrews 11 and 24 by faith
[1:59:07] Moses when you come to years
[1:59:08] when he come when he come to years
[1:59:10] somewhere around you know uh
[1:59:13] 12 13 years old I would I would say
[1:59:16] refused to be called the son of
[1:59:18] Pharaoh's daughter
[1:59:19] choosing rather
[1:59:21] to suffer Affliction with the people of
[1:59:24] God
[1:59:26] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:59:30] season
[1:59:31] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:59:36] riches than the treasures
[1:59:39] in Egypt
[1:59:41] Moses forsook it
[1:59:44] offers such
[1:59:47] because he found
[1:59:50] the anchor
[1:59:52] greater riches
[1:59:55] what good is it to have riches
[1:59:58] and no anchor
[2:00:00] what good is if God has predestinated
[2:00:03] you to be here on this Earth well praise
[2:00:06] the Lord not gonna hold you too much
[2:00:07] longer if God's predestinated you to be
[2:00:10] here on this Earth
[2:00:11] if these ordained you for a certain
[2:00:14] purpose
[2:00:17] and God's got that purpose for you
[2:00:21] then how are you going to be fulfilled
[2:00:24] except you fulfill
[2:00:27] the purpose
[2:00:29] blind Fanny Crosby
[2:00:31] when they were sort of making fun of her
[2:00:35] and saying you've
[2:00:36] you've written 8 000 songs
[2:00:39] all of these hymns
[2:00:41] and you act like you love God
[2:00:44] and he's been so bad to you
[2:00:50] you've got a gift and yet you you've got
[2:00:53] a gift there's no doubt about it you
[2:00:55] have got a gift if any Crosby we still
[2:00:57] sing some of her songs
[2:00:59] Fanny's Fanny Crosby will will forever
[2:01:03] be known as as as one of the top
[2:01:06] songwriters
[2:01:10] for him you've said you've wrote you and
[2:01:14] she didn't just listen she was a little
[2:01:16] blind lady who would be out there uh
[2:01:18] helping the poor the needy she would go
[2:01:21] to the orphanages this this little lady
[2:01:23] worked for for she was like a little
[2:01:25] evangelist this little lady just worked
[2:01:28] for God
[2:01:29] and she says and and these people would
[2:01:31] poke and see and yet God
[2:01:35] the one that you say is so great good
[2:01:38] good just like that
[2:01:39] and heal your eyes
[2:01:43] out of everything you've done for him he
[2:01:48] was just little Pinky and he could heal
[2:01:50] your eyes
[2:01:54] you you still will love him
[2:01:58] she says oh
[2:02:01] I will love him
[2:02:03] he's been good
[2:02:05] they said well what are you going to do
[2:02:06] how are you going to how are you going
[2:02:07] to know him when you get to heaven how
[2:02:09] are you going to know whether it's
[2:02:10] whether it's him what if you're still
[2:02:12] blind when you get on the other side
[2:02:13] he's had every opportunity to heal you
[2:02:15] here and he's not done it so how do you
[2:02:16] know you're even gonna have eyesight
[2:02:17] when you get to the other side
[2:02:19] Hallelujah
[2:02:21] and that's when she started singing the
[2:02:23] song I shall know him
[2:02:26] I shall know him
[2:02:29] I shall know him by the
[2:02:33] by Redeemed by his side I shall stand I
[2:02:36] shall know him I shall know him I will
[2:02:38] know him by the nail Prince
[2:02:41] in his hand
[2:02:46] she had a purpose
[2:02:49] she said she said
[2:02:52] if the Lord if you and and you kids that
[2:02:54] that have any of you kids read her
[2:02:56] biography read on Fanny Crosby I'd
[2:02:58] encourage y'all to read her read the
[2:03:00] book about her because it's really
[2:03:01] incredible but she said
[2:03:04] or in Providence
[2:03:07] that if he were to heal my eyes
[2:03:10] I would wander off from his will
[2:03:14] but the Lord has kept me blind
[2:03:17] so that I can fulfill his will
[2:03:19] she was in love with her purpose she was
[2:03:24] satisfied in her own skin
[2:03:27] she had a purpose that no one else could
[2:03:30] fulfill but her not my brother not my
[2:03:33] sister not my mama not my daddy I'm the
[2:03:36] only one that can fulfill that purpose
[2:03:38] it's
[2:03:40] Eternal representation and Glory
[2:03:44] it's predestination it's what God has
[2:03:48] called me to
[2:03:50] therefore I will glory in mine
[2:03:54] infirmities is what the Apostle Paul
[2:03:57] says I will glory why he had a purpose
[2:04:07] why why would the Apostle Paul they
[2:04:10] could come up to the Apostle Paul and
[2:04:11] say
[2:04:13] why would you still serve him two-thirds
[2:04:15] of your your your your Christian life
[2:04:17] has been in jail
[2:04:19] Paul says
[2:04:24] talk to them I I I I I don't know
[2:04:27] but maybe he would say something like
[2:04:29] this
[2:04:30] if I didn't have the time in jail I
[2:04:32] wouldn't have the time to write the
[2:04:33] letters which
[2:04:35] Wendell Martin down in 2023 will end up
[2:04:38] needing
[2:04:39] New Life Outreach down there in 220 2023
[2:04:43] is going to if I am out they're not
[2:04:45] going to write down what I'm saying they
[2:04:47] didn't write down what he was saying but
[2:04:49] I guarantee you we still have what he
[2:04:51] wrote
[2:04:54] you know why
[2:04:56] because while all of the other apostles
[2:04:59] were out running all over the place
[2:05:01] preaching the gospel the Apostle Paul
[2:05:04] was chained
[2:05:07] in shackles
[2:05:13] the prophet of the first church age
[2:05:21] hahaha
[2:05:23] did not get to live free like everybody
[2:05:25] else
[2:05:27] would have been to his choice sure sure
[2:05:29] I mean yeah yeah he could have yeah I'm
[2:05:32] sure he could have done something
[2:05:33] differently I'm sure others could do
[2:05:35] things differently I but if God's called
[2:05:38] me for
[2:05:41] SF
[2:05:42] Moses
[2:05:44] be thankful for the purpose that God has
[2:05:49] given you
[2:05:51] and those intervals sometimes can get
[2:05:53] lonely and dark those intervals
[2:05:56] sometimes those delays sometimes can get
[2:05:59] can get can you say man
[2:06:01] now when I talk about the when I talk
[2:06:04] about darkness and and and and and and
[2:06:06] and gloomy I'm not talking about your
[2:06:08] heart being gloomy I'm not talking about
[2:06:09] that at all I believe I I believe that
[2:06:12] you can have your hands up in the air
[2:06:13] shouting and rejoicing and dancing right
[2:06:15] there in the middle of the fiery furnace
[2:06:16] I believe you can lay down amen and rest
[2:06:19] right there while the lions are all
[2:06:20] roaring all around you I I believe that
[2:06:24] if you're in your the will of God if you
[2:06:27] are there with a purpose why not be
[2:06:30] content
[2:06:34] why not be content
[2:06:37] instead of fighting against the anchor
[2:06:42] remember if you want that anchor
[2:06:43] enlarged you can go around
[2:06:45] just go the opposite direction of the
[2:06:47] purpose and before you know it your
[2:06:49] anchors loose
[2:06:52] I'm gonna I'm gonna just allow that
[2:06:54] anchor to hang on to me buddy I want
[2:06:56] that anchor at all oh praise the Lord
[2:06:58] can you say amen amen he see but but the
[2:07:02] Bible says but the Bible says they're in
[2:07:04] Hebrews 11 and 25 choosing rather
[2:07:09] to suffer reflection with the people of
[2:07:11] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[2:07:12] for a season estimating the reproach of
[2:07:15] Christ greater riches
[2:07:16] then all the treasures in Egypt for he
[2:07:19] had respect unto the recompense of the
[2:07:21] reward
[2:07:22] Hallelujah he knew he was here for a
[2:07:25] purpose
[2:07:26] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[2:07:28] the Wrath of the king for he endured as
[2:07:30] seeing him who is invisible there was a
[2:07:33] delay he he forsook it all and then the
[2:07:36] next thing we find on Moses he forsook
[2:07:39] Egypt he forsook the king I mean he he
[2:07:42] stood up
[2:07:44] and then it didn't work
[2:07:46] he come to deliver the people and it
[2:07:48] didn't work the next thing we know was
[2:07:49] Moses he's 40 years out in the desert
[2:07:52] all by himself as a fugitive
[2:07:56] Don't You Know The Enemy was just right
[2:07:58] there
[2:08:00] hey dim wit
[2:08:04] Palace and now you're out here
[2:08:07] with a woman that's mad at you all the
[2:08:09] time Hallelujah
[2:08:12] you're out here in this hot burning
[2:08:14] desert oh my goodness right
[2:08:21] 40 Years of delay
[2:08:26] and then all of a sudden
[2:08:29] a promise comes well praise the Lord
[2:08:32] are you following me
[2:08:35] so we're thankful for the delay
[2:08:37] be thankful
[2:08:39] when you're not feeling is pregnant
[2:08:40] you're not feeling like you're on top
[2:08:43] if you're called you have a purpose
[2:08:46] turn to your neighbor and say you have a
[2:08:48] purpose
[2:08:50] now if you're not resting
[2:08:53] in that anchor
[2:08:56] laughs
[2:08:58] I wish you would
[2:09:01] I don't want God don't want Christians
[2:09:03] so I just are flailing all over the
[2:09:04] place and there's ship going every which
[2:09:06] direction and being tossed way over
[2:09:07] there no no no no I'm sure you're gonna
[2:09:09] be going up and you're going to but but
[2:09:10] when you're anchored
[2:09:13] you're anchored
[2:09:14] can you say mine
[2:09:16] I'm anchored I'm here with purpose
[2:09:19] I've got his purpose
[2:09:21] so Joshua and Caleb the great generals
[2:09:23] of the faith of the Old Testament
[2:09:25] now they left Egypt
[2:09:27] thinking there's going to be three days
[2:09:29] journey from Egypt to the promised land
[2:09:31] what a glorious thing
[2:09:34] they were thinking we're going to be
[2:09:35] eating milk and honey in three days
[2:09:37] God's brought us out delivered us he's
[2:09:40] sold his mighty hand over here it's
[2:09:42] going to be wonderful three days journey
[2:09:45] we're going to be there we can fast that
[2:09:48] long and we'll get there we won't matter
[2:09:51] of fact we're going to hold our appetite
[2:09:52] we're not even going to eat nothing
[2:09:54] until we get on the others we believe
[2:09:55] God we believe it 100 there's milk
[2:09:58] there's honey there's a land of promise
[2:10:01] I'm looking forward to it 40 years later
[2:10:05] in the wilderness
[2:10:11] see God doesn't talk about the delays
[2:10:14] God doesn't talk about the
[2:10:16] intervals
[2:10:18] it's not going to be rational
[2:10:20] in fact
[2:10:22] most will not see it
[2:10:24] the way that God sees it and the
[2:10:26] believer sees it most will say
[2:10:29] serious
[2:10:31] most will say
[2:10:33] you're still believing God
[2:10:35] most will say huh
[2:10:40] and all of the to me
[2:10:44] on them
[2:10:47] because in the test and the delays where
[2:10:50] the test is
[2:10:52] but there were two that were still
[2:10:53] standing
[2:10:54] I'm sure they weren't fasting for 40
[2:10:56] years
[2:10:57] they've probably gave in and decided to
[2:10:59] start eating a little bit
[2:11:01] but when they got to the other side they
[2:11:03] found the milk and the honey and they
[2:11:04] found the grapes and they found the
[2:11:05] pomegranates and they
[2:11:07] can you say man
[2:11:11] amen God was so honored that he said
[2:11:13] Joshua I'm going to put the spirit that
[2:11:15] I have on Moses I want to put it on you
[2:11:16] Caleb because you have a spirit that is
[2:11:19] different from everybody else I'm going
[2:11:22] to give my I'm going to give that land
[2:11:24] to you they're they're in in numbers 14
[2:11:26] and 24 but my servant Kayla because he
[2:11:29] had another spirit with him and and have
[2:11:32] followed me fully him will I bring unto
[2:11:34] the land where unto he went and his seed
[2:11:37] shall possess it someone shot Hallelujah
[2:11:41] [Applause]
[2:11:45] praise the Lord
[2:11:49] the Bible says that the seals and and
[2:11:51] and and if uh well I was going to say if
[2:11:54] the musicians want to come but I am the
[2:11:55] musician unless brother Merle wants to
[2:11:57] play the guitar amen
[2:11:59] you can't play the piano amen
[2:12:03] or may or may or or sister Sharon or
[2:12:06] Karen says Karen might might have a uh
[2:12:09] since this Karen's a piano player too
[2:12:12] amen Rhodes brother Bo told me all about
[2:12:15] it amen
[2:12:19] but in this in this last day
[2:12:24] the the scripture says now get now catch
[2:12:27] this the scripture says that they're
[2:12:31] back in in the prophet John when he gave
[2:12:34] the Thunders and John was a the
[2:12:37] revelation of the Thunders and John was
[2:12:38] about to write it down John seen the
[2:12:40] Revelation John heard the Revelation
[2:12:42] John was fixing her write down what the
[2:12:44] Thunders uttered and then the Bible says
[2:12:46] the angel says seal it up
[2:12:50] seal it up you gotta wait till the time
[2:12:52] of the end
[2:12:53] but then the scripture says amen they're
[2:12:56] in in Revelations 10 and 5 an angel
[2:12:59] which I saw stand upon the scene upon
[2:13:02] the Earth lifted up his hand in heaven
[2:13:03] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[2:13:05] ever who created heaven and the things
[2:13:07] that therein are and the Earth the
[2:13:09] things therein are and the Sea and
[2:13:11] things there are in that there should be
[2:13:14] time no longer I looked up 15 different
[2:13:17] translations on this and and it and it
[2:13:21] and the the time is is not in any of
[2:13:23] them this is what they everyone say
[2:13:25] there will be no more delay
[2:13:30] so he is saying
[2:13:32] a man seal up the book but then there
[2:13:35] Comes A Time in these last days
[2:13:37] that the delay the opening of the book
[2:13:41] will will no longer be delayed but it
[2:13:44] will be known and then the very next
[2:13:46] verse in the days of the voice of the
[2:13:49] seventh angel the mystery
[2:13:55] of God should be finished as he has
[2:13:57] declared to his servants the prophets
[2:14:00] so there Comes A Time there's been a
[2:14:02] delay seal up the book it's not time for
[2:14:04] the first stage second age third age
[2:14:05] fourth age fifth age six age seventh age
[2:14:08] it's not it's not time it's not time
[2:14:11] but then the Bible says but when that
[2:14:12] seventh angel comes when that seventh
[2:14:14] messenger comes that church age Prophet
[2:14:16] comes then the time of delay
[2:14:19] will be no longer
[2:14:22] then the book is open the book is
[2:14:26] unsealed then the Bible says the next
[2:14:29] verse you put yourself in it and he says
[2:14:32] go take the book that is open in the
[2:14:36] hand of the Angel and eat that book
[2:14:40] the time of delay is no more
[2:14:45] now you're saying
[2:14:47] well what do you mean of delay it seems
[2:14:50] like he's been delaying his coming he's
[2:14:52] delaying his promise
[2:14:53] the whole church don't listen to me
[2:14:55] listen to me look at that look at the
[2:14:58] Grand scope of things we've went through
[2:14:59] 2 000 years of delay of showing those
[2:15:02] Thunders but here we have in this
[2:15:05] generation the promises of God Made Real
[2:15:08] to you why why is this important because
[2:15:12] it's in the evening time when Jew when
[2:15:14] when Israel was to leave Egypt that they
[2:15:18] were to take that lamb in the evening
[2:15:20] time and they were to eat that lamb and
[2:15:24] they were to have their shoes
[2:15:26] on they had the staff in their hand they
[2:15:29] had to take that blood apply it eat the
[2:15:33] lamb in order to go on that to go on the
[2:15:36] journey folks God has given us this open
[2:15:40] word apply that blood in this evening
[2:15:43] time eat that word in this evening time
[2:15:47] your faith is fixing to become sight
[2:15:56] something keeps pulling me what is it
[2:15:59] it's the anchor it's the one myth in the
[2:16:02] veil that is Pauling me we're that close
[2:16:05] to this rapture

[2:16:28] on that word is pulling you up higher
[2:16:36] I know he does all things three things
[2:16:39] as he descends but I want to say Christ
[2:16:41] never puts his foot on the earth so it's
[2:16:43] not him descending it's us
[2:16:46] ascending
[2:16:50] it's not it's not you're not going to
[2:16:52] see Christ you're not going to see Jesus
[2:16:53] here on the earth in the Rapture but

[2:36:43] and that Anchor Holds you
[2:36:45] [Music]
[2:36:47] it doesn't matter
[2:36:52] because that anchor will hold you 100
[2:36:54] percent
[2:36:55] so you don't want the pastors
[2:37:01] charisma
[2:37:03] you want God's anointing upon his word
[2:37:08] is that right
[2:37:09] Hallelujah none of us are guaranteed
[2:37:12] tomorrow
[2:37:13] so you don't want Mom and Dad's

[2:37:21] but you want to stand upon the promises
[2:37:23] of God
[2:37:25] knowing
[2:37:28] that that anchor will hold and if every
[2:37:31] one of us should be wiped out by morning
[2:37:33] and you're the only one left standing in

[2:37:41] no you were Anchored In Christ
[2:37:43] you were anchored in this message and
[2:37:45] your purpose means more to you than

[2:37:52] daddy you lose your brother you lose
