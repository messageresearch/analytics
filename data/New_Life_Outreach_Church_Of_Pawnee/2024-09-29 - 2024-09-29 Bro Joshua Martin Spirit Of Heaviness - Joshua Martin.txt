brought you this far he's going to continue to take you all the way on brother Brandon would say the same holy ghost that saved you is going to keep you and I believe that's a promise that we can grab a hold of in the time of uncertainty and turmoil there's one that's walking with us and holding our hand amen if you have your Bibles this morning I got two portions of scripture Isaiah 61 And1 and Luke 4 and18 like to say it is good to be back home we definitely we miss everybody when we're when we're are away yall are always in our thoughts and in our prayers uh we got back home yesterday we was there in Missouri at brother Ben Beard's meetings and man that they've been having some tremendous meetings and so we thank the Lord for that I think brother Andrew is preaching this morning morning and so then they have a fish fry after the service so I know that's sounds like a good time and let's just remember all those that'll be traveling back home today and tomorrow that the Lord will keep them safe but Isaiah 61 And1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek and ha sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the the year of the Lord and the day of the Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and to point unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he may might be glorified you thankful for that then Luke 4 and 18 these are just some things I've been studying on for the last couple months and I know Uncle Jonathan touch touched on some of these things that are meetings so just bear with me if I repeat a little bit of those things um but this is what's been on my heart and Luke 4:18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor Heath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of the of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it to the the minister again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasten fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears amen can we bow our heads this this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and we're thankful for your mercy God thank you for giving us this opportunity to come into your house Lord and and to sing songs of worship father Lord thank you for Liberty father that we feel here this morning Lord as we come into this portion of the service Lord I ask that you would anoint me Father Lord as I've studied Lord and I ask that you would just Lord if you need to move me from my notes God I ask that you would just have complete Liberty and control in in this vessel father Lord I Surrender myself to you Lord I ask that you would anoint the congregation as well Lord may they also get in the same channel Lord of inspiration and and receive the blessing that you have formed this morning Father Lord we ask that you would be in the meetings there in Galina Lord I ask that you would anoint brother Andrew as he would Minister this morning Father Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen and you may be seated if I had a a subject it would be the spirit of heaviness and brother brandham he would preach this day the scripture is fulfilled and he would say this how accurate is the scripture if you'll notice that that this in Isaiah 61:2 is where our Lord was reading from Isaiah 61:2 but in the middle of the second verse of Isa Isaiah 61 he stopped where it said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year then he stopped why the other part to bring judgment it didn't apply to his first coming but his second coming but it didn't apply there how the scriptures never make a mistake they are always perfect Jesus stopped just where the scripture stopped because that was exactly what was to be Vindicated in his day now when the first coming the second coming he will bring judgment upon the Earth but not then he was to preach the acceptable year of the Lord so brother Brandon would tell us he was picking up that scripture and would go to the second verse half of the second verse and would stop and would say this day the scripture is fulfilled and I believing I believe we're leaving in the day where all scripture is being fulfilled we're not living in the hour where scripture is being made or written or or prophecies are coming forth concerning this age but we're living in a time where prophecies are being fulfilled the very hour that we are living in and I believe judgment is coming upon the Earth something that is taking place right now not the Great Tribulation but judgments are upon the Earth and brother Brandon would say this we realize that judgment is striking great Faults Are Falling in and the nation is shaking earthquakes in diverse places great hysterical historical things that we've heard of these past days of judgment Through the Bible and we see it repeating again and he would say the prophecy saying as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and we see it happening now men's hearts are failing perplexity of time distress between nations God we know we are at the end time in another place last year standing in the same place where Mr woods and I were going up the hill in the kind of of mourning about his wife being sick the holy spirit said pick up the rock laying there throw it up in the air when it comes down say thus sayith the Lord there will be judgment strike the Earth tell him that he'll see the hand of God in the next few hours and I like how brother brandom is saying that judgment was going to strike the Earth but he also gave a promise to Mr Woods that he was going to see the hand of God and I believe we're living in the day of judgment but at the same time we have seen the hand of God come to the Earth and we see the manifestations of it he will continue to say I told Mr Woods he's present now or present tonight and I guess eight or 10 of the men or 15 that was there at the time when it took place the next morning where the Lord came down in a whirlwind ripped the mountain out around us and cut the top of the trees loose and made three blasts and said judgment is heading towards the West Coast two days after that Alaska almost sank beneath the Earth and since then up and down the coast the belches of God's judgment is against the spiritual scream so judgment is striking the earth now we see nation is against Nation uh men's hearts are failing them for fear we see all of that happening now and it's so easy to get so focused upon the judgments that we miss the beauty of the hour we we we we get so focused on maybe the homosexuals or or the white house or politics you know it's it's been prophesied that America is going to go down but it's so easy to get so focused on the negative that we fail to see that the mighty Angel has come down with an open book letting you know that Jesus Christ is here on the Earth today you know brother Brandon would tell us if he would have a choice to pick any day to live in it would be today you know not in the first day with the Apostle Paul but it would be right here because this is the fullness of time and brother brandom he would say this here he read the scripture handed the books back to the priest and said all the eyes of the people were fastened upon him and he looked upon them and said this day the scripture is fulfilled I read the scripture with dozen or more evidences that we're living in the last day the generation that will see Jesus Christ return to the Earth and I say to you again this day the scripture is fulfilled in your sight you in Tucson you in California you in New York on on the telephone hookups this day the scripture is fulfilled in your sight brother brandom says that we're living in the day where the generation is going to see The Return of Jesus Christ upon the Earth and he would say this day the scripture is fulfilled brother Brandon would tell us he's here in every aspect but the Corporal body his word is here his presence is here letting you know that you can make it through the judgments that are upon the earth now you can make it through it and I say here in PA e this day the scripture is fulfilled we're not waiting for something to come to reveal Christ we're not waiting for another message to come and open up the seals but we had a message come and reveal to you what was under those seals you see the seals ain't something so complicated that we can't understand but brother Brandon would tell us that he's the one that opened the seals not brother brandom but he's the one that opened the seals and he says what was those seals it was Christ so when the book came open in this generation we can see the Christ a't Million Miles Away but Christ is here revealing to you that he's the same yesterday today and forever in the time of mourning there's an anchor that can bring you through it brother the Brandon would say look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to open the Seven Seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God see the quickening power of God foretold that this would take place see the quickening power of God made the world to testify of it it's the truth the angel of the Lord I told you was around the pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was we knew just look this way and it was our Lord up there he was talking about Mount Sunset and in that a lot of this is coming from the rising of the Sun and brother brandom at the beginning of that would talk about Mount Sunset and would say they couldn't see what it was because they wasn't predestinated to it but here brother Brandon would say he's the one that opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ and so what was Mount Sunset it wasn't a man up there it was our Lord the mighty angel coming down with an open book in hand letting you know that this is the time the judgment's upon the Earth but at the same time I'm coming to the Earth fulfilling my word not in Jesus body but in your body not just in a prophet not just in a preacher but in leoty in a young man in a mama and or in a Daddy it's the it's the mighty Angel giving you a book and says here is your Authority it's the quickening power making the word live and brother Brandon would tell us this here and he would say now we see his association with the word he is the word that is who he is the word is the word in his name in John 1:1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from where we get or translation the word is logos and which means the with the thought or concept it has a double meaning of thought and and speech now a thought expressed is the word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful so John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus so the very concept who God was was expressed in the body of Jesus Christ but the Brandon was say in another place the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt among us and so the body of Jesus was the Fulfillment of word and of the word and what did we get in this generation not the body of Jesus but the body word of the son of man letting you know that the same power that was in the New Testament was the same power in the Old Testament is here today for fulfilling his word one more time not in one body but a multi-member body oh that should give us something to Rejoice about knowing that God has not left us here by yourself but he is with us every step of the way oh my the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt among us and so if the quickening power has come in this generation to open the seals and those seals was Jesus Christ that means all of who God is is has been given to this generation the very substance of who God is not the Corporal body but the very being the supernatural The Presence of Jehovah has come back to the earth once again but the brand would say this may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing Revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested we would do the greater work works and glorify God our Father in heaven so he would say if the Holy Spirit would give us continuous Life Giving Revelation what is the holy spirit it was Mount Sunset the quickening power coming and revealing to you there's a revelation here that would give you a prevailing power and I like how he would say it uh get a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested so once you get this quickening power you would be the Living Word manifest and you will do the Greater Works oh you see John 14:12 ain't something for brother Brandon but it's for you to do the Greater Works you believe that this morning and I like that brother Brandon is putting that if you can get a fresh Revelation and become by it you will be the Living Word manifested I don't believe we're serving a dead God or or a dead letter but we are the Living Word manifested and my opening scripture would say that we can be the Trees of Righteousness and you see a tree is per is bringing forth blossoms bringing forth fruits and I believe that's what we are to have not the spirit of heaviness not not ashes but in the midst of that we are a tree of righteousness that has swapped or ashes for beauty that has swapped our mourning for joy that has swapped the spirit of heaviness for the Garment of Praise because wherever you are planted in is what you are going to Bear if you are planted in heaviness you're going to produce heaviness you're going to produce uh mourning you're going to produce depression but if you are planted in this word the lifegiving substance of Revelation you are the tree of righteousness producing the the Greater Works producing the Revelation in flesh brother Brandon would say in Psalms 1 and3 and he shall be uh he shall be like a plant like like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper oh man if the tree is planted by the rivers of water it bringeth forth fruits in his season and so the season that the fruit is to be manifested if he's planted in the right things he's going to bring it forth but you got to make sure you're planted in the right things and brother Brandon or Jeremiah 17:7 the Bible would say blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters that spreadeth out her Roots by the river and shall not see when the heat cometh but her Leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit and I think that's an incredible thing it's saying that when the heat comes if it's planted by the rivers of water and when the heat comes it's Ro is still going to remain oh we're living in the most wicked age that there is the greatest battle ever fought is right in the mind we feel the pressure we feel the heat we feel anxieties and depression but in the midst of that we are planted in the right thing and the fruit is not withering up by depression but it is still producing the Greater Works even in the midst of anxiety and Insanity there's somebody that is still producing the fruits of righteousness oh we are a tree that is planted in the midst of judgment there is still fruit oh my brother Brandon would tell us that the last plague in Egypt was death not spiritual death but natural death and he would say the last plague here today is not a natural death but a spiritual death and so Rel living in that time where the the church members are coming to church but they're dead why they liveth but in the midst of that there was a lifegiving source called prevailing Revelation the Bible would say now the Lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so where the where the quickening power is there's a fruit that can be manifested inside of your life it's the Living Word pushing back the darkness so that there can be a tree of righteousness oh it's pushing back the heaviness the Bible would say in 2 Corinthians for God who commanded the L the shine out of Darkness has also shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ for the God who commanded he didn't ask and said please Darkness move back or or I beg you but he commanded and that Living Word the loost would begin to brood over the darkness and would push it back and the Apostle Paul is saying has also shine in our hearts in other words the the same God that commanded uh chaos to bring forth order is the same God that has commanded order inside of our life in this generation oh it's the same light that has come and pushed back the darkness pushed back the heaviness so that there can be fruit oh it was God commanding let there be light it's the same Living Word restoring order in order to bring forth the Trees of Righteousness and this here is where I I would get this thought from it's in the rising of the Sun but the Brandon would say now the Sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form it was void it was covered with water and was laying in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light and God had a reason to do that for down beneath the water were seeds that he had planted and had to have that sunlight to make it live and so the sun didn't put the seeds there but the sun came because there were seeds there I think that's a beautiful thing because the message didn't make you a son the message came because you were a son it was the sunlight coming and go pushing back the heaviness pushing back the darkness so that there can be a tree of righteousness bloom in the midst of the judgments upon the earth oh Hallelujah brother Brandon will continue on to say and the first light that was ever given given on the Earth was God's spoken word the first life that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy in life upon the Earth and so when the sunlight would push back the darkness it would bring forth the creation of joy you see I don't believe that this message is a message of condemnation you believe that this morning it's not a message of condemnation but it's a message of hope it's a message of Grace it's a message of promises that you're not going down defeated but you're going to oh but you're going to overcome but we needed a light to come in the midst of our darkness and bring forth a joy oh you see we're not meant to be depressed all the time we're not meant to be be bogged down by anxiety all the time but the light has brought some joy and the Bible would say Psalms 89 and5 blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk oh Lord in the light of thy countenance so blessed is the people that know the joyful sound and I believe he got that joyful sound in this generation what is this message it's the gospel trumpet proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord and it's a joyful sound that is comforting all that mourn cuz the Bible would say my opening scripture Isaiah 6 1 and 2 to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn Matthew 5 and four blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted brother Brandon would call up a Year of Jubilee and he would say if you was a slave back back in the Bible days if you was a slave or you was in prison and had to give a son to pay a debt or a daughter to pay a debt he would say there would come the Year of Jubilee and he would say they would they would they would bring forth the trumpet and when the trumpet sounded it didn't matter if you was a slave if you was a prisoner once you heard the trumpet sounded you can go free but if you desired to remain a slave he would say you would be marked yall remember that he would say they would take you to the temple and would put a would put a hole inside of your ear and you would be marked as you're a slave for the rest of your life but you see even though the joyful sound would bring forth Liberty if if you remain or desired to remain a slave the joyful sound would not do anything for you and I believe this message is a joyful sound that's the Year of Jubilee that you don't got to stay in that heaviness but we still have a choice in order to remain in the heaviness or to be a tree of righteousness you see because because influences is going to persuade us it's going to push us either towards the things of God or away from the things of God and brother Brandon is saying there in the rising of the Sun that when the sun rose over the Earth there was a gloomy atmosphere but once it Rose over that Earth it would bring forth the creation of joy and I believe this message can bring forth a creation of Joy if you're tired of heaviness there's a creation of joy for you if you're tired of the Blues there's a creation of joy for you if you're tired of depression if you're if you're mourning you can be com it there's a creation of joy you can walk in the lights of his countenance David would say in my presence is the fullness of joy oh not in the presence of the critic but in thy presence is the fullness of joy and what did we get in this generation The Presence of Jehovah has come down the the the has come down and let you know that I am walking upon the Earth today what brother brandom say my Ministry is to declare that he is here he says we've had many find preaching many find pastors many find evangelists but I'm trying to bring to you the reality of his presence in other words he's not a million miles away but he is here and in his presence is the fullness of joy oh Hallelujah not the fullness of depression but the fullness of joy where you don't got to mourn anymore you don't got to be in depression anymore but there is a creation of joy that has come by this light oh we don't got to be in the Blues we go through hard times we go through situations we go through through circumstances but that don't got to weigh us down there's a message a joyful sound that can bring us through every situation that we go through oh Hallelujah but the Brandon would say notice now as the Gloom covered the earth and the seeds could not live without the Su into rise and the Gloom covered the earth now when the S wind was risen all the Gloom was vanished by the light as it spread across the Nations and the people oh so not just countries but the people you see this ain't a group message it's a personal message so it didn't just go to Nations it went around the world what seven times I believe brother the brandom says but it didn't just go to the world it went to the people oh this message didn't just come the p e but it come to people individuals that is in human flesh that has a weaknesses that has Sorrows that has scars that has pains hurts that has been hurt by words been hurt by actions the message come to people and the Gloom can be vanished by the light oh hallelujah how many's ever been hurt before man You' never been hurt before man I've been hurt by words I've been hurt by actions but this message is a light to come and push back the Gloom oh man how many's ever been hurt by a parent before you know it's it's sometimes bitterness can rise up but it's a light coming to push it back and say you're not meant to be a representative of Gloom you're to be a representative of the tree of life you know brother brand would say Jesus was that tree of life oh man so we are producing the very fruits that Jesus was producing upon the earth oh my when Christ Rose it pushed back the Gloom but if the people have a choice to remain in the Gloom it would do no good for him you see the Bible would tell us in Luke 24 and three and they entered in and found not the body of Jesus and it came to pass as they were perp as they were much perplexed there about behold two men stand stood by them in shining garments the word perplexed in the Greek means at a loss of way Webster's definition means filled with uncertainty or puzzled and so we would see that they were they were perplexed there were them brother bandam would use that word a Gloom or fog as a loss of their ction or confusion and here we would see that when these when these two ladies would come by the BR the Bible would tell us that it was at the rising of the Sun and brother brandom he would use that scripture for the rising of the Sun that they would come to the supplier of where Jesus was buried but yet they were perplexed even though the sun was up could you imagine that even though brother Brandon would talk about if the sun is shining outside and he says how how crazy would a man be to go in the basement and close the close the blinds and says there's no sun and he would stay in the darkness and say there's no such thing as a sun he says how crazy would that man be because there is a son but he has shut himself up from it and here comes these two ladies to the supplier of Jesus but yet they were confused even though the sun was up but you see brother Brandon would say this here and and she said whence cometh the mother of my lord for as soon as the salutation come in my ears my baby leaped in my womb for Joy Hallelujah yes sir oh brother we are not in a fog we know where we are at another place he just thought we was a bunch of Holy Rollers or fanatics but he found out we were not lost in the fog we knew where we were going another place those Spirits are just like a shadow like a like a big Dark Cloud standing there just like a fall cold and indifferent and so heaviness that comes over you is Spirit Spirits oh it's Spirits coming to cause confusion and here were these young ladies they were confused but then there would come a message oh Hallelujah here would come a message and would say why seek ye the living among the dead yeah ain't that incredible why seek the living among the dead in other words you're you're looking through gloomy eyes you're looking through fog you're looking through confusion and you're never going to find him that way but the son is up to banish all of the confusion and the Bible would say in Luke 24:5 and the and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but he is risen remember how we spoke I spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words oh so here they were they were confused they was in a fogginess they was in a confused state but then there would come a message and would say why seek the living among the dead and that would bring the bring up a remembrance a prophecy concerning that day oh the Angels didn't bring something new it just brought back to remembrance what was already spoken concerning that day but they were so focused upon the persecution that they fail to see that the Sun is up and I say this message has brought back to remembrance what was prophesied for this generation don't get so focused upon the anxieties around us that we fail to remember his words that he says I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I will be with you to the end of the age I will be with you not just an angel not just a dead letter but I will be with you until till the end of it don't be confused don't live in a fog but my son has come H the son has risen to push back the fog oh Hallelujah and don't seek the living among the dead and I believe that whatever you wave in front of your family whatever you wave whatever you lift up in front of yourself is what is going to influence you because here was Jesus risen up but they were perplexed because they were so focused upon the negativity and the Bible would tell us if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me I will draw all men unto me so whatever you lift up is what is going to draw you you remember the story where the Brandon would tell about the five sons that were in the Navy y y'all remember that story and he would say there was nobody in their family history that was ever in the military and the and the parents were confused because as soon as the oldest grew up he went into the Navy the second oest went into the Navy all five of them would raise up or grow up and would go into the Navy and but the brandom says they were confused because they didn't know how this was happening cuz what made them do this and they started to investigate it and brother brandom says that inside of their bedroom was a picture of a ship that was upon the ocean y y'all remember the story and brother brandom says every night before they would go to bed they would look at that picture every morning they got up they would look at that picture so what was lifted up before them drew them out of their family history and changed the course of their family Direction and put them on another course and if a a picture of a natural sea a natural ship can do that what about Jesus what about this message if you lift it up it can change the course of family history oh you see generational curses were passed down from generation to generation but if I be lifted up I will draw on men unto me where not to lift up family gener family curses things that have been passed down from generation to generation that is gloominess it's heaviness that is trying to keep you from your potential but if I be lifted up if the Sun is up if you point the children to the sun Point your family to the sun it will draw all men unto me oh you see the word draw means to lead with an inward power in other words if I be lifted up I will eat generally draw them oh they might not hear my voice naturally but there's predestination on the inside that I am drawing them to my side the Bible would say where the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered will be draw would inwardly be drawn unto me oh not lead buzzards but lead Eagles and so if I be lifted up I will draw the Eagles unto me because you see the devil had claims upon families here y'all know that generational curses are claims upon marriages it's claims upon your mind it's claims upon your children pornography can be acclaimed and it's passed from generation to generation tempers is a claim that can be passed from generation to generation it's the devil it's it's heaviness that would have a claim upon family Generations but when the sun rose the sun claimed you oh brother brand I going say another thing that is still signif his ownership the seal has a mark on it it shows ownership and when you are bought by the blood of Jesus and sealed by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by God you're no longer are owned by the world you are owned by God the Apostle Paul would say I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ I'm no longer a prisoner to sin or the things of the world but I am owned by something else you know but the Brandon would talk about the abstract and the title deed he would say you can have the title deed but if there if there ain't an abstract on it it don't belong to you because there can be leans against it you remember him talking about that and he would say there was leans upon us and he would say brother when you get courage enough uh enough to step out and go toe to- Toe with the devil and Scat him off if I went in my house and I had a legal deed for my house if I went in there and someone was laying there drinking and carrying on carrying on and I say you have to get out friend well this is a house for human beings I've got a right to be here I'd say no you don't I possess this house it is mine well he would say I got a right just like sickness into the body or sin whatever it is say well the other ones drink the others do this others do this way but he has no legal rights I could take my abstract deed down to the courts and say look here someone is in here that does not belong to me it's because I have an abstract deed to the property so not just a title but an abstract that clears off every lean that is against him and so a family a generational curses or leans that comes up against you brother Brandon would talk about uh the the girl that had the had epilepsy and brother Brandon would say that this this curse or this illness would come from the grandparents it would come from Grand parents to her parents now she is struggling with this illness but brother brandom he would say this here but when the abstract came and struck it off everything was omitted and so when the abstract come to that little girl that had a family a generational curse that claim that the devil had upon her was broken and now she was claimed by something else and I say Lord let me be desperate for my children let me make sure they are claimed by the message not claim the message but the message claim them let the quickening power come on the inside and open the seals to the end you know the seals can be open but if you if you don't got a revelation of it it's not going to be open to you but if the same quickening power that open the seals can come on the inside it will reveal the seals to you not only to you but to your children oh hallelujah we're living in the day man where where I I get nervous with my children being teenagers there's lesbians homosexual Spirits how do I know that my children are going to make it I don't know that but by the claiming power of the quickening power that's the only way we can have hope for our children is knowing if they can ever get the quickening power on the inside of their life it claims them you know brother Brandon would say when when you get the Holy Ghost God is sealed in and the devil is sealed out and brother the Brandon must say then you are wrapped in the life of the blood sell of Jesus Christ that means if you're wrapped in something before the devil can get to you he's got to get through what you are wrapped in right but brother brand would say many people say that the devil made me do it he says no the devil didn't make you do it you just wasn't sealed yet because he says once you are sealed the only way the devil can get to you is to be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost then he's your brother so if you're wrapped inside of the life of the blood shell which is the quickening power there's no way the devil can get to you there's no way he can get to your children if they are ever wrapped oh Hallelujah with the quickening power and every H and every claim is struck off then they are wrapped in the blood cell of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah you see Rahab should have been another statistic right she her house was upon the walls the Bible would tell us that that she her house was upon the walls and could you imagine whenever the children whenever these spies would talk to reab and letting her know that the judgment's coming here she was living in the city where judgment was coming to she should have been another statistic right Austin you should be another statistic brother the mar should be another statistic your marriage should be another statistic and here is Rahab that was sitting upon the walls looking out the window maybe and saying the children of Israel marching around the wall marching around the wall marching around the wall she hears the trumpet shout she hears that they start to shout and she hears a crumble maybe she her house maybe starts to shake a little bit and she looks out the window and she sees Susie's house go down maybe John's house goes down over here and she's thinking am I going to be another statistic just just imagine for a second she is sitting there in the midst of judgment and she's looking out am I going is my marriage going to be another statistic is my young is my teenager going to be another statistic come on now is my mental health going to be another statistic is my health in my body going to be another statistic and there's one thing she can look to the true token she can look to the true token and know that that token speaks for me in the midst of generational curses something speaks better than the evidence that is against me oh when there's a blood that speaks better things oh remember the Bible would tell us that the blood of Jesus speaks better things than that of Abel the blood of Abel would speak of condemnation and cry out against Cain but the blood of Jesus does not cry out if against you but it speaks for you that it don't matter the generational curses that has claimed you that has claimed your children that has claimed your marriage that has claimed your mind that has claimed your body there's something else that speaks for youu Hallelujah and has claimed you and is forcing it give it back you remember the brandom he would tell the story about when brother Evans had his truck stolen y'all remember that story and his truck was stolen and they got together to pray about it and as they started to pray brother the Brandon would have a vision and he would say there's a there's a man I think in a yellow shirt that was driving to Bowling Green and he would say the Holy Ghost would convict him and would condemn him for driving that truck and then he would turn that truck around and would bring it back and brother Brandon say what was it in forcing give it back see that's it that's what it's talking about restore bring it back to its original owner and if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of God we have arrived this morning by the Holy Ghost to enforce the claim of God bring it back if he's Afflicted you made you sick you have a right before God to enforce the laws of God by your stripes we are healed and amen bring it back turn him loose you're taking him out there under death but we claim him bring him back the enforcement restore it back to the Natural condition a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is sick SE they're are out of their natural condition they have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because God has given it to us oh so generational curses are out of your natural condition when God looked before the foundation of the world you know brother Bram would talk about the woman at the whale brother Brandon would say that there whenever she would notice that I recognize Jesus it would bring her to the image that God had of her before the foundation of the world and so when go God would look at the woman at the well before the foundation of the world he didn't see a prostitute he seen someone blameless and whenever she would recognize that The Presence of Jehovah is in my midst it would bring her back to that perfected image oh Hallelujah it would restore her back to her original condition the devil would have to give her back to the claim that God would have upon her life oh when God looked at you from before the foundation of the world he didn't see a struggling marriage he didn't see rebellious teenager he seen a bride without spot and without wrinkle and he sent the spirit he sent a message and would say give it back Satan you got every claim on their life you have to let go but the Brandon would say who are you Satan who do you claim to be he would say every claim that you had was broke at Calvary so he would have a claim but when Calvary but when whenever Christ was crucified it broke the back of every claim every generational curse every marital problem that would be on your life it would break it and would say give it back it's not us claiming it's us believing in the claim the God gave us oh Hallelujah give it back but if you lift up this message above the heaviness heaviness loses its claim hope this is making sense this morning it's heaviness it's gloominess it's darkness that brings forth generational curses it's darkness that brings forth these things but if I be lifted up I would draw all men if I be lifted up wherever the carcass is there the Eagles would be gathered together Luke 24 and10 and it was Mary Magdalene and Johanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with him which told these things unto the apostles and their words seemed that seemed to them as Idol tales and they believe them not ain't that incredible that it was because they were so focused on the negativity that the words seem as Idol Tales oh many times that's where we get how many's ever been there before you get Battle you get warn you have problems at work you have problems at home and you come to church and the pastor gets up or an evangelist gets up and starts preaching the promises of God but they seem as Idol tales and the Bible says they believe them not and behold the 13th verse and behold two of them went the same day to a village called EMAs which was from Jerusalem about three score forong Longs and they talked about they talked together all the things which had happened they talked together about all the things which had happened and then here they come here came Jesus but they were talking about all the troubles the things all the troubles that they looked at the promises as Idol tals but what happens whenever we get troubled even though the sun has risen we start to talk about this problem I'm this preaching this morning hope it's okay we talk about this problem we talk about how this one done me wrong how that that done me wrong how this here's this way there's this way and the promises of God seemed as Idol tells if we're always dwelling on the negative we're never going to see the positive cuz brother Brandon would tell us if you want Christ to come near talk about him right talk about him so here here would come here would come Jesus and would come in the in their presence but they were so troubled that they did not recognize he remember King Bazar the Bible would say that he was troubled in Daniel 509 then was the king bazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him so the troubless of Bazar begin to change how he looked at things begin to change how he believed things and the Bible would tell brother brandom would tell us when the disciples were on the boat and the storm would come by their way brother brandom says they were having a testimony service you remember that they were having a testimony service they believed that this was God they believe that the the Miracles are taking place then there would come troubles and now they went from saying how great God is to looking at Jesus and would say do you care that we perish what would made their change what made them change the troubles and so now the troubles has causing thoughts to arise in their heart of negativity and instead of looking to the answer they look to the troubles here's the Jesus in the boat to bring a peace to bring a light to their Darkness to bring a creation of Joy but there were so focused on the troubles they failed to see who is in the boat oh in little church we get so focused upon the troubles we get so focused on the negativity we get so focused about this what what this one's saying what that one is saying here stands the answer oh Hallelujah here stands a creation of joy and and Jesus is sitting there saying just come wake me up wake me up I will bring I will bring the answer to the solution you know brother brandom says we have the answer to the to the devil's question this message is the answer but we get so focused on the problem we look to Dr doson we look to this one we look at preachers in the message what do they say about it we've got the answer we've got the creation of Joy but you notice what the what the queen belshazzar's wife would say there's a man with an excellent Spirit but has that has a that can dissolve the doubts and brother Brandon would say that what is the pro he would talk about the scripture and would say what is the prophet he says that was a proph the prophet aniel that had an excellent spirit and he says what's the prophet today the Holy Ghost right and he's here to dissolve the doubts and you see troubles changes the way we look at God the Bible would say in Luke 24:38 and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts so them being troubled would cause them to look and think at the negative the Bible would say in Psalms 119 and 28 my soul melteth for heaviness but strengthen thou me according to Thy word Proverbs 12:25 he heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop but a good word maketh it glad and so I love how how it's given the contrast that heaviness melts the soul but strengthen me according to Thy word heaviness maketh the heart stoop but a good word maketh it glad it's letting you know that in the midst of the heaviness there is still Jesus in the ship there is still a positive word in the troubles in the he in the spirit of heaviness there is a word a Garment of Praise that you can put upon you and will bring you to into and plant you by the rivers of life and make you a tree of righteousness Hallelujah you see it's troubles heaviness brother Brandon was saying you're in the need of prayer too cuz you got a heavy heart but God knows the secret of the heart do you believe he can tell me what your heaviness is about it's because you want a baby and I see two dark sh Shadows you have two miscarriages in your time is that correct so this lady will have heaviness not because she chose to but because of hurts oh man I've been hurt before I've been bitter before it's Heaven things you can't control but you can control how the heaviness affects you so here stands this lady in the in front of the prophet and brother brandham starts to discern her life and and we look past the heaviness we look past it and when when go to the root of the problem and would say you were hurt you had two miscarriages now there's two Shadows hanging over you oh and I believe we had a word that can look to is still Discerning the hearts that can go to the root of the problem and say you don't got to be bitter you don't got to be broken you may have had natural circumstances that bring this upon you but I'm looking through it and see that there's Shadows that can be taken away by the light you can look at Martha and Mary the Bible would say in Luke 10 41 and Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha thou W careful and troubled about many things and this is really stood out to me because here is Martha that is troubled right and you would think the one that can help her troubles is standing right in front of her here is Jesus in her very house and here if anybody could help her troubles it was Jesus but what did she do with her opportunity now this really spoke to my heart what did she do with her opportunity instead of looking to Jesus and saying hey help my troubles she says have you seen Mary so here she stood in the in the presence of the solution oh man we do that many times sit in church oh hope so and so's listening I hope so and so oh that one needs to hear it and IR understanding the solution to the troubles if you would just talk to me if you would just listen to what I got to send Jesus will look to Martha and would say but Mary has chosen the good thing that would not depart from her right oh she chose the good thing she did not waste her opportunity to complain about her troubles oh Hallelujah there's a difference in asking for help in the troubles and complaining about the troubles because if you're complaining about the troubles you're never going to listen right hope this is okay you know many many men always say that whenever the wife comes and starts to complaining she don't want you to answer she wants you to listen right how many's ever heard that before and that's the way we come to God complaining God's trying to help you but you're not listening oh I'm preaching now if you're complaining about the troubles complaining about this one complaining here is the solution but all we can think about is that one all we can think about is this one but Mary chose the right thing she wasn't complaining she was sitting at the feet of Jesus not wasting her opportunity and I see little church don't waste her opportunity if it's a Wednesday night a Sunday morning a Sunday night it's the solution it's the light to bring forth a creation of joy in the midst of all of the troubles but one thing is needful the 42nd verse one thing is needful and Mary chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her oh man I said Lord don't let me cause troubles to miss out on your visitation so here are the two on the way to Emmas and instead of talking about the beauty of the hour they were talking about the Troubles of the hour and I love this and Luke 24:15 and it came to pass that when they communed together and reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with him Jesus himself and but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad so their Communications was bringing a heaviness on oh Hallelujah their Communications them talking about the troubles now were making their heart sad and they were so sad and so caught up in the troubles that Jesus himself the Lord himself shall descend the mighty Angels come down with an open book but they were so troubled that here came Jesus and the Bible would tell us that they when Jesus asked what are you talking about they say are you a stranger in these parts the troubles had got them so wrapped up in heaviness that Jesus himself was a stranger oh don't let Jesus Jus be a stranger whenever I'm in the boat in the stormy weather let him not be a stranger but let me recognize him the conversations they were having LED them in a in a condition of heaviness but Jesus didn't leave him there but he started the Bible will tell us that he he he he started there with Moses's teaching and went through all of through the scriptures and the Scrolls preaching concerning himself and the Bible would say as he broke the bread their eyes was open in Luke 24 and3 and it came to pass as he set a meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them and their eyes were open and they knew him so while they were in the heaviness they did not know him but once the bread was broke oh what was the bread what is the bread that Jesus would say I am the bread of life I am the living bread the Bible would say in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout for the brand must say what the shout it's a message what is the message it's the living bread the open book it was Jesus himself coming with a broken bread letting you know you can know me even in the troubles even in the heaviness here is your eyes can be open that you can know me the Bible would say in John 6:35 and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto to you that ye have also seen me and believe not brother brand will say and a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth a bride oh it's the living bread coming and says hey you can know me and what is this message doing saying you can know me brother Brandon would tell us that a prophet was to come and reveal the Mysteries which is the living bread and you see I'm so glad that that here Jesus would not leave these two in their fog just give me a few more minutes and I'll bring this down to a close but you see here was Jesus walking with him but he was not willing to leave them in this fog leave them in this confusion leave them in the state of not knowing who he was but he was willing to break the bread he was willing to let them know that the sun is up you know and I'm so glad that God wasn't willing to leave us there leave us in our confusion leave us in our heaviness leave us in our state where we could not recognize him you know brother the BR would talk about whenever he was fishing there on the east coast and he would say that him and brother Ed Bisal would hire a guide and would take them out fishing but there was a young man that was with them that was young and didn't know the didn't know the ropes and things and brother brandham says they started the drift off and it was dark and foggy he says if you've ever been there you would know it's foggy it's dark and he says and this young man started to panic and would say oh we're drifting away from the shore we're drifting out the sea and brother brandham says the old man would stop and say calm down just wait till the sun comes up then you will know where you are at and brother Brandon would say just wait till the sun comes up and we will see where we are at he is the word so here was this young boy sitting in the fog of confusion but there was an old veteran that would say just wait quit panicking you might not understand how you're going to get back to the shore you might not understand how you're going to make her through this trouble but the sun is coming up once you can see the sun he will let you know where you are at oh don't give up in the hard times the Sun is up the Sun is up shining through the clouds shining through the fog you know brother Brandon would would talk about a jocked whenever she put Moses in the Nile River but the brandom says she would look up and look through the clouds to a god that was caring for him so even though the sun could not be seen because of the clouds she knew that he was there and maybe you can't see this promised word because of the clouds but it is still there the sun is still shining to bring forth the creation of joy you know brother Brandon would talk about we talk about the the rainbow and would say God gave that promise thousands of years ago but God still Honors that promise and when does the rainbow appear whenever it's dark whenever there's clouds whenever it's been raining and thundering and lightning it's after the storm is when the rainbow appears and says I have not forgotten my promise oh when it's whenever you're at the darkest time that God let you know I have not forgot my promise you remember the story by the Brandon Matel about the sand the footprints on the sands of time y'all remember that and the man was complaining saying why did you leave me there and God would say I didn't leave you there what do you mean he would say look there's two sets of footprints but right over here there's only one set and God would say that's when I picked you up and carried you it was at the darkest time at the weakest hour is when God would come and pick him up oh when it's a true weakest moment then the then the judgments you feel upon the Earth where you feel like you're losing your mind you feel like everything's going to fall apart that you can look through the fog and say I know my redeemer liveth and at that day I will see my God in this flesh I'm going to see it even though this flesh is battered it's beaten it's worn I've got a promise oh Hallelujah weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning weeping may heaviness may end door but once the sun rises up it's going to bring something it's going to bring a joy you see but
