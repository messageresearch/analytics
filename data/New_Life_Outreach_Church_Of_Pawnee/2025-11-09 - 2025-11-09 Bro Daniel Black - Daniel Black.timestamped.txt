[5:52] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[5:54] Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[5:57] we're so [music] thankful,
[5:59] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[6:00] &gt;&gt; that you brought us back to you, Lord.
[6:02] We know none of us could have come to
[6:04] you if you hadn't called us and chose
[6:06] us, [music] Father. And Lord, we're so
[6:08] thankful that we can come to you knowing
[6:10] that you're our healer. You're our
[6:11] comforter. You're everything there
[6:13] [music] is to us, Lord. And Lord, as we
[6:16] stand here remembering all the good
[6:17] things that you've done for us and all
[6:19] the healings that you've given us and
[6:22] all of the finances [music] that you've
[6:24] given us, Lord. Lord, you are
[6:26] supernatural. Everything that you say
[6:28] and do is supernatural, Lord. And Lord,
[6:31] we love you and we're so thankful for
[6:33] it, Lord. But in remembering what you've
[6:35] done for us, we know that we can stand
[6:36] and remain on your word, Lord. Because
[6:39] if you've done it once, you'll do it
[6:40] again. So Lord, as we stand here
[6:43] thankful for what you've done, Lord, now
[6:44] we're asking you. [music]
[6:46] We have two requests that came, one
[6:48] that's in the hospital. Lord, Lord,
[6:51] hospitals, they can put it back. They
[6:53] can give you medicine that [music] can
[6:55] help. But but God, we know that all you
[6:57] have to do is look their way, Father,
[6:58] and it's all well.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we ask you to look down on him
[7:02] in the hospital, Father, and take that
[7:04] infection, Lord, and just push it out.
[7:06] Satan can't have him. Not today, Lord.
[7:08] So just take that away, Father. We
[7:11] you've done it before. We know you'll do
[7:12] it again. And we're standing here
[7:14] expecting, Father. And Lord, the one
[7:16] that had a loved one pass away, Lord.
[7:18] Lord, we all everybody in this building
[7:20] knows what it's like to have a loved one
[7:22] pass away, [music] Lord. Lord, it hurts
[7:24] cuz we're selfish and we want them to be
[7:26] here with us, but you promised us the
[7:28] comforter. [music] So Lord, I ask you to
[7:30] send a comforter into that home and with
[7:31] that family, Lord, and [music] give them
[7:33] something to look forward to every
[7:35] minute of every day, Father. And help
[7:37] them. We ask it, Lord. [music] And Lord,
[7:39] the unspoken requests, Father, there's
[7:41] many. I know there is. And not just for
[7:43] us, but for your bride all over the
[7:45] world, Lord. [music]
[7:46] Lord, we ask you to take those unspoken
[7:48] requests and answer them. Father, thy
[7:50] will be done.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we ask you to take the [music]
[7:53] rest of this service, Lord. Bless it.
[7:55] Bless the songs. Bless the preaching.
[7:57] Lord, we ask it in the name [music] of
[7:58] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

[20:30] move on sister.
[20:33] This is [singing] the moving day
[20:38] for us to move a little closer
[20:40] [music and singing]
[20:42] where the streams are flowing.
[20:45] Move on, brother. [singing] Move on.
[20:49] [music]
[20:58] Thank you, Jesus.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; You know, you're getting up there when
[21:07] it's in your mind when the preacher says
[21:08] that the young people stand, you start
[21:10] to move a little bit. And if you get to
[21:12] where I'm at, you don't move much more
[21:13] because your kids are no longer the
[21:16] young people.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; And I remember when I first got saved, I
[21:20] was 19 years old.
[21:22] You know, most of you know brother David
[21:24] Gadman. [music] You really He's known
[21:25] all over the place. He's one that was
[21:28] befriended me for three or four years.
[21:30] Kept telling me, "You had to come to
[21:31] church. When you come to church," I
[21:32] said, "Oh, someday, David." I used to
[21:34] tell [music] him, "David, we were both
[21:35] the same age, hung out together." I used
[21:37] to tell him, "David, you going to tell
[21:38] you something? If I were getting saved,
[21:40] you I always love my rock and roll. You
[21:42] ain't taking [music] it from me." But
[21:44] you know what? God has a different plan.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; All right?
[21:48] &gt;&gt; And he takes when I You try to do it on
[21:50] your own and throw the rock and roll
[21:51] out. I tried that too. I'm going to
[21:52] listen to Christian music. That don't
[21:55] work either.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; When he does it,
[21:57] &gt;&gt; he does it right.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Now, now we have I was as a young
[22:01] [music] man 19 years old when I gave my
[22:04] life to the Lord. And
[22:07] [music] now I've been married for almost
[22:08] 43 years,
[22:10] have four children, grown. The youngest,
[22:12] today's Matthew's, my son [music]
[22:14] Matthew's birthday. He's 32. So when
[22:17] your youngest is 32, you're like, "No,
[22:19] I'm not young people anymore, but I'm
[22:21] heading to it." I like what brother
[22:22] Clark used to say years ago. Said, "If
[22:24] the Lord carries, I'm closer." Look at
[22:26] young people say, [music] "Lord Terry,

[42:16] privilege to be among you today. [music]
[42:18] Um I just love the Lord. I I really do.
[42:21] And uh going to let our musicians be
[42:23] seated if you'd like to. And really
[42:25] appreciate the songs that we heard
[42:27] today. And uh I sure didn't expect to
[42:29] see the Wheeler family today. God bless
[42:31] you guys. It's good to see you. I said I
[42:32] wasn't going to do it and I did it,
[42:33] didn't I? [laughter]
[42:36] I just uh well, human frailty, I guess,
[42:39] you know. But I just want to say that I
[42:41] love every one of you. I just I I truly
[42:43] love the Lord. And I believe that if
[42:45] you'll come expecting today, the Lord
[42:46] will go meet you right on your eyeball
[42:49] level and meet you with what you have
[42:51] need of today. Uh I want to speak to you
[42:53] on a thought this morning. called to
[42:55] cross over. Called to cross over. And uh
[42:59] St. John chapter 5:es 30 through32.
[43:04] And uh
[43:06] just want to read this in the name of
[43:07] the Lord and pray that he'll help me to
[43:09] get myself out of the way because my
[43:10] kneecaps are about buckling together uh
[43:13] from nervousness, you know. But uh I
[43:15] pray that that'll never go away, you
[43:17] know, that we'll always be nervous in
[43:19] his presence because it's a holy it's a
[43:21] holy place.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; St. John 5:es 30-32 he says
[43:28] I can of mine my own self
[43:31] do nothing
[43:33] &gt;&gt; as I hear I judge and my judgment is
[43:37] just because I seek not my own will but
[43:41] the will of the father which had sent
[43:43] me. If I bear witness of myself, my
[43:46] witness is not true. There is another
[43:49] that beareth witness of me. And I know
[43:52] that the witness which he witnessth of
[43:55] me is true. Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[43:58] we love you. I thank you for your word,
[44:01] Lord. And Lord Jesus, this it is the
[44:03] only thing in this world that will
[44:04] stand, Father. Everything else will pass
[44:06] away, but Lord, your word will always be
[44:08] there, Father. Lord, that's what we want
[44:10] to stand on today. Father, I ask you,
[44:13] Lord, to anchor us to it, Lord. We love
[44:15] you. Be with us now in Jesus name. Amen.
[44:18] God bless you. You can be seated.
[44:22] You know, Jesus did not come out and
[44:24] just go around telling everybody, "I am
[44:26] the Messiah. I can do works. I can do
[44:28] these things." Uh God confirmed who
[44:31] Jesus was. God was the one that bore
[44:34] witness of who he was. And you know,
[44:36] it's one thing for man to say that God
[44:38] is with him. It's another thing for God
[44:41] to bear witness that he is with the man.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't want to just have a
[44:46] church that has God's name on it. I want
[44:48] God to put his name on me,
[44:50] &gt;&gt; you know. And we on his seal, brother
[44:51] Brennham talked about the seal of
[44:53] approval. When they put a seal on a
[44:54] cart, he said they wouldn't put it on
[44:56] the rail the seal on the cart until
[44:58] everything was right. Sometimes there
[44:59] would be jars moving around and
[45:01] different things and reasons why he
[45:02] couldn't put the cart the seal on. But
[45:04] once he put the seal on, it was sealed
[45:06] to the day of redemption, sealed to its
[45:09] destination. And you know, the people
[45:11] put seals on just about anything today.
[45:13] They'll put, you know, their name on
[45:15] anything because they don't care about
[45:16] the product that they have. They don't
[45:18] value what they're doing. And, you know,
[45:20] that's a representation of whatever that
[45:22] name is. But, you know, God is is so
[45:24] much greater than that. God's not going
[45:26] to just put his name on anything. God
[45:28] takes value in his name. And I believe
[45:30] God takes value in his word. God takes
[45:33] value in his people. And, you know, I
[45:35] believe that God's word is holy. How
[45:36] many you believe that today? You know, I
[45:38] believe that if we would reverence God
[45:40] the way the much as we could reverence
[45:41] God, the more God would come into our
[45:43] midst. You know, people will honor a
[45:45] judge and different things because, you
[45:46] know, when they step into that
[45:48] courtroom, that judge has the authority
[45:50] to cast them into prison. That judge has
[45:52] the authority to do great harm or great
[45:54] things for them. You know, but there's a
[45:56] heavenly judge. There's a great judge
[45:58] that's holier than all. You know, I
[46:00] would that we can walk in the fear of
[46:02] the Lord of acknowledging I am in the
[46:04] presence of a holy God. You know, he's
[46:06] so holy that he told a man one time,
[46:08] "You got to take your shoes off because
[46:10] you're on holy ground." I believe that
[46:13] same God from back then is the same God
[46:15] that's here today. If we will reverence
[46:17] him and reverence his holiness, you
[46:19] know, the most religious people in the
[46:21] world thought God was with them because
[46:24] they held the words of a prophet. How
[46:26] many knows that's true? In St. John 5:es
[46:29] 37-47
[46:32] it reads and the father himself which
[46:34] hath sent me hath borne witness of me.
[46:37] You have neither heard his voice at any
[46:39] time nor seen his shape and you have not
[46:42] his words abiding in you. For whom he
[46:44] hath sent him you believe not. Search
[46:47] the scriptures for in them you think you
[46:50] have eternal life and they are they
[46:52] which testify of me. and you will not
[46:55] come to me that you may have life. I
[46:58] receive not honor from men, but I know
[47:01] you that you have not the love of God in
[47:03] you. I come in my father's name and you
[47:06] receive me not. If another shall come in
[47:09] his own name, him you will receive. How
[47:11] can you believe that which receive honor
[47:14] one of another and seek not the honor
[47:16] cometh from God only?
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Do not think that I will accuse you to
[47:21] the father. There is one that accuseth
[47:24] you, even Moses in whom you trust.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; For had you believed Moses, you would
[47:29] have believed me, for he wrote of me.
[47:32] But if you believed not his writings,
[47:34] how shall you believe my words? These
[47:37] were a religious people of the day. This
[47:39] is not just some people that were living
[47:41] a dirty life or something like that.
[47:43] These were a people of a reputation in
[47:46] the town, in the city. If they said,
[47:48] "HEY, WHAT ABOUT SO AND SO?" THEY'D SAY,
[47:49] "THAT'S A GOOD MAN. That's a GOOD
[47:51] BROTHER. BUT THIS was a man that was AT
[47:53] FUNERALS. THIS WAS A man that went to
[47:55] weddings. This was a man that kissed the
[47:57] babies. THIS WAS NOT A TERRIBLE PERSON.
[47:59] These were MEN THAT WERE UPRIGHT
[48:01] standing men. And these are men that had
[48:03] a testimony IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THESE
[48:06] ARE MEN IF YOU WERE TO ASK FOR FOR
[48:07] ADVICE. WHO WOULD YOU GO TO TALK TO? I'M
[48:09] GOING TO GO TALK TO THIS GUY BECAUSE
[48:11] THIS IS A GUY THAT'S GOT SOMETHING ABOUT
[48:13] HIM. BUT YET THESE MEN HAD JESUS CHRIST
[48:16] STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY
[48:18] DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM. BROTHER AND
[48:20] SISTER, THEY WERE HOLDING THE WORDS OF A
[48:22] PROPHET OF MOSES AND SAYING, "I'VE GOT
[48:25] THE TRUTH." BUT THE TRUTH WAS STANDING
[48:27] RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. BROTHER, I DON'T
[48:29] WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ME WHERE I'M
[48:31] SAYING, "I'VE GOT THE MESSAGE OF THE
[48:32] HOUR IN THE VERY ONE, JESUS CHRIST,
[48:36] STANDING RIGHT IN MY MIDST." AND I DON'T
[48:38] EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; I WANT HIM TO PUT HIS SEAL ON MY LIFE.
[48:43] NOT ME SAY I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER, BUT
[48:45] GOD SAY THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF THE
[48:48] BELIEVER. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. THIS IS
[48:51] WHAT YOU'RE CALLED TO.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; YOUR GREATEST [screaming] CALLING YOU
[48:54] HAVE IN YOUR LIFE IS TO BE A SON AND
[48:56] DAUGHTER OF GOD. IT'S NOT TO BE A
[48:58] PREACHER. IT'S NOT TO BE A SINGER. IT'S
[49:01] TO BE A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[49:02] [screaming]
[49:03] BECAUSE WHEN YOU HEED TO THAT, YOU JUST
[49:05] SAY, "THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD."
[49:07] [laughter]
[49:08] YOU'RE CLINGING ON TO HIM BECAUSE YOU'RE
[49:10] WALKING WITH HIM. YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM.
[49:12] AND THEN IF GOD WANTS YOU TO DO THOSE
[49:14] THINGS, HE'LL LEAD YOU TO DO IT. BUT
[49:16] DON'T SEEK AFTER THOSE THINGS. SEEK TO
[49:19] FOLLOW THE SHEPHERDS AS SON AND DAUGHTER
[49:21] OF GOD. THERE ARE SO MANY PREACHERS THAT
[49:23] ARE LOST WHEN THAT DAY THE PHARISEES
[49:26] SADDUCEES STANDING RIGHT there lost
[49:30] &gt;&gt; and didn't recognize him.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you when you are
[49:33] anchored with God,
[49:35] &gt;&gt; anchored with your shepherd. I know and
[49:38] who I'm following.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; I want that. I want it so much.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; I want it so much. I don't want to be
[49:44] something that's fake. I want him to be
[49:45] in my midst. You know, I heard a story
[49:47] one time. You were doing a book club.
[49:49] You'd read books about so everybody read
[49:52] the same book and you'd sit in the room
[49:53] and you would talk about your theory of
[49:55] what you think the book means. And
[49:56] everyone had their theories what they
[49:58] thought it mean. And this one man back
[50:00] here says, "Well, I think it means
[50:01] this." And they said, "Well, who are you
[50:04] to say that? I wrote the book."
[50:08] The author standing right in their midst
[50:10] and they got their own opinions and the
[50:12] very one that wrote the book was in
[50:13] their midst and they were trying to
[50:14] criticize him. You don't even know what
[50:16] you're talking about. So, I wrote the
[50:18] book. [applause and cheering]
[50:20] A
[50:20] &gt;&gt; lot of people sitting around the
[50:21] message. I THINK IT MEANS THIS. I THINK
[50:22] IT MEANS THAT. AND the whole time the
[50:24] one that wrote it
[50:26] &gt;&gt; is right in our midst.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, I want that.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; I want it so bad in my home where he is
[50:33] with me where I can say, "The Lord is my
[50:36] shepherd."
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; These men, these religious men were
[50:40] claiming to hold the words of Moses. And
[50:42] Jesus said, "I won't be the one that
[50:45] accuses you. The very prophet you claim
[50:48] to follow will accuse you."
[50:50] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Many people say the they would have
[50:55] followed Moses, Elijah, or Jesus back
[50:57] then, but what they do now is what you
[51:00] would do then. Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's good.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; So, it behooves us to dig into the
[51:04] scripture and to see who we are and what
[51:07] that we're standing for. And I want to
[51:10] ask you this question and I want you to
[51:11] think about it throughout this service.
[51:14] What are you seeking
[51:16] &gt;&gt; from the honesty of your heart? I want
[51:18] you to think about that. What am I
[51:19] seeking really? Am I seeking healing? Am
[51:22] I seeking a this? Am I seeking that?
[51:24] What really am I seeking? I left my
[51:26] water back there. Is this my water in
[51:28] this cup here?
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. I get
[51:31] thirsty.
[51:33] You want some?
[51:35] I shouldn't do that.
[51:39] St. John chapter 6:es 26-40. This is a
[51:42] little bit of scripture reading, but
[51:43] please just follow with me and let's see
[51:44] what the I heard a brother say one time,
[51:46] brother Jess Tramble, he said in your
[51:48] when you're in a service, he's you
[51:50] realize there's enemies coming at him
[51:52] while he's preaching the whole time. He
[51:53] said, so try to look through that and
[51:55] see what is this man trying to say to
[51:57] me. What is the message? And so do that
[51:59] this morning. Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 6 26-4.
[52:04] Jesus answered him and said, "Verily,
[52:06] verily, I say unto you, you seek me, not
[52:08] because you saw the miracles, but
[52:10] because you did eat of the loaves and
[52:12] were filled. Labor not for the meat with
[52:15] perish, but for that meat which endureth
[52:17] unto everlasting life, which the Son of
[52:19] Man shall give unto you, for him hath
[52:22] God the Father sealed." Then said they
[52:25] unto him, "What shall we do that we
[52:27] might work the works of God?"
[52:30] Jesus answered and said unto them, "This
[52:33] is the work of God, that you believe on
[52:36] him whom he hath sent."
[52:38] &gt;&gt; They said, "Therefore unto him," What
[52:40] sign shall thou then that we may see and
[52:42] believe thee? What dost thou work? Our
[52:46] fathers did eat mana in the wilderness,
[52:48] as it is written, he gave them bread
[52:50] from heaven to eat. Then Jesus said unto
[52:53] them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[52:56] Moses gave you not that bread from
[52:58] heaven, but my father giveth you the
[53:01] true bread from heaven."
[53:03] &gt;&gt; For the bread of heaven is he which
[53:05] cometh down from heaven, and giveth life
[53:07] into the world. Then said they unto him,
[53:09] Lord, evermore, give us this bread.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread
[53:15] of life. He that cometh to me shall
[53:17] hunger, shall never hunger. He that
[53:19] believeth on me shall never thirst.
[53:23] But I said unto you that you also seen
[53:26] me and believe not. All that the Father
[53:28] giveth me shall come to me, and him that
[53:30] cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
[53:33] out. For I come down from heaven not to
[53:36] do mine own will, but the will of him
[53:39] that sent me.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; brother and sister, the meat of the
[53:43] father is to do the will of the father.
[53:46] not to try to do different things, but I
[53:48] want to do your will, Father. What is
[53:51] your will for my life? And if I was to
[53:53] ask that across this building of you to
[53:55] write on a piece of paper, how many of
[53:57] you know what the will of your life is?
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, it's the most
[54:00] important thing in your life is to walk
[54:02] in the will of the Lord. We don't want
[54:04] to just walk in the will of the
[54:05] permissive will, but the perfect will of
[54:07] God. And Jesus said, "This is the meat."
[54:09] How do we do the works of God? He said,
[54:11] "Seek to do the will of the father." How
[54:14] many of you want to see God working in
[54:16] your life? You know how you're going to
[54:18] do it? Seek to be in the will of the
[54:21] father of following his leadership
[54:23] because God wants to lead you. You know,
[54:25] a guide whenever you we need a guide AND
[54:27] A GUIDE, HE don't want to make it to
[54:29] where you can't follow him. THE GUIDE
[54:31] WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HIM AND SO MUCH
[54:33] MORE. THE HOLY SPIRIT WANTS YOU TO
[54:35] FOLLOW. HE WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HIM. HE
[54:37] WANT HE DON'T WANT TO TRIP YOU UP. HE
[54:39] WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HIM. BUT YOU SEE, WE
[54:40] HAVE TO SEEK AFTER HIM. BUT THE ENEMY
[54:43] WILL PUT ADVERSARIES AND AND TRIALS AND
[54:45] ALL THESE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE TO COMPLEX
[54:47] YOU TO TO FEEL YOU BEAT DOWN WHERE YOU
[54:49] DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IN THE MIDST OF
[54:51] ALL THAT, BROTHER AND SISTER, SEEK TO BE
[54:54] IN THE WILL OF THE FATHER. I DON'T KNOW
[54:56] HOW I'M GOING TO PAY THIS BILL.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; I NEED THIS HEALING in my family. I NEED
[55:00] THIS TOUCH IN THE LORD. DON'T SEEK FOR
[55:02] THAT. DON'T SEEK FOR THE HEALING. DON'T
[55:04] SEEK FOR THE NEED. SEEK TO BE IN THE
[55:07] WILL OF THE FATHER.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU do that, he'll do that
[55:10] automatically. Yeah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "Seek you first the
[55:13] kingdom of God and his righteousness."
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; He said, he says, "And this is the I'm
[55:20] sorry." Scripture says, "And this is the
[55:21] will of the father which hath sent me,
[55:23] that all which hath given me, I will
[55:26] lose nothing, but should raise it up
[55:30] again at the last day. And this is the
[55:33] will of him that sent me, that everyone
[55:35] that seeth the son and believeth on him
[55:38] may have everlasting life, and I will
[55:40] raise him up at the last day.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And I want to say it again, brother and
[55:44] sister, seek the will of the father.
[55:47] Whether you are a young person in this
[55:49] room or you are an old person in this
[55:51] room, it don't matter what it is that
[55:54] you are facing.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Listen to these words. Seek the will of
[55:58] the father. what in in this circumstance
[56:01] that I am in God, what is your will in
[56:04] this
[56:05] &gt;&gt; because sometimes his will is not what
[56:07] we want it to be.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's absolutely the opposite
[56:10] of what we want it to be.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; But you know, you want to work in the
[56:14] will, the perfect will of God because
[56:16] God, you know, no prophet, no minister,
[56:18] and no person can do the works of God.
[56:20] You cannot. If I was to walk to brother
[56:22] Window and I said, "Brother Windle, I
[56:23] want you to do this miracle for me." As
[56:25] much as he loves me, he can't do it.
[56:27] Yeah,
[56:28] &gt;&gt; he can't.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; The only one that can do it is God.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Only thing he can do it. SO IT DON'T
[56:34] MATTER WHAT IT IS. We can try, we can
[56:35] preach, we could shout, WE CAN JUMP UP
[56:37] AND DOWN, WE CAN DO ALL THOSE THING. It
[56:39] won't work. Brother Bam talked about how
[56:40] that you have electricity in this room.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; We have enough electricity in this room
[56:44] that we can light the world up. But just
[56:46] screaming and shouting at the
[56:48] electricity, electricity, light up,
[56:50] electricity light up. RIGHT? IF IT'S
[56:52] DARK IN HERE, ELECTRICITY, SPEAK IN
[56:54] TONGUES, ELECTRICITY LIGHT UP. CAUSE
[56:56] THIS ROOM TO LIGHT UP, IT'LL NEVER WORK.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; In the SAME SENSE, IF I NEED TO GET
[57:00] WATER FROM THE DESERT OVER TO THIS OTHER
[57:02] from the water from this oasis, SO TO
[57:04] SPEAK, TO TO THE DESERT, I COULD SCREAM
[57:06] AT IT. I COULD SHOUT AT IT. I COULD
[57:08] SPEAK AT IT. GET THE WATER OVER THERE.
[57:10] GET THE WATER OVER THERE. SPEAK IT.
[57:12] IT'LL NEVER WORK. NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.
[57:14] BUT IF I WILL WORK ACCORDING [screaming]
[57:16] TO THE LAWS OF ELECTRICITY, BROTHER,
[57:19] SISTER, WHEN YOU FLIP THE SWITCH, THE
[57:21] LIGHT COMES ON.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; IT DON'T MATTER. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
[57:23] ABOUT THE SHOUTING. IS NOT ABOUT THIS.
[57:26] IT'S IT'S ABOUT WORKING ACCORDING TO THE
[57:28] LAWS. AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
[57:30] WITH GRAVITATION. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
[57:32] WITH ELECTRICITY. AND THAT'S THE WAY IT
[57:34] IS WITH THE POWER OF GOD.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WANT THE POWER OF GOD IN YOUR
[57:38] MIDST, YOU HAVE TO WORK ACCORDING TO THE
[57:41] LAWS OF THE [screaming] WORD OF GOD. SO
[57:43] GOD'S NOT GOING TO MOVE ON IF YOU GOT
[57:45] SOMETHING THERE THAT'S OFFENDING HIM.
[57:47] SOMETIMES GOD WILL ALLOW SOMETHING TO
[57:49] COME OVER YOUR LIFE THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY
[57:52] HUMBLE YOU TO NO PEACE BECAUSE HE'S
[57:54] TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR THIS MINISTER TO GO
[57:58] PULL THAT OFF OF YOU WHENEVER THAT VERY
[58:00] THING THAT'S ON YOU IS TO GIVE YOU A
[58:02] WEAPON TO GET YOU BACK TO THE PLACE OF
[58:04] GOD?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; SATAN CANNOT DO ANYTHING UNLESS GOD
[58:08] ALLOWS IT.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; NOTHING. SATAN IS ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS
[58:12] UNLESS GOD ALLOWS IT.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; HE HAS TO HAVE HIS APPROVAL. SO NO
[58:17] MATTER WHAT'S [screaming] COMING AT ME,
[58:18] THAT DEVIL CAN LAUGH ALL HE WANTS TO.
[58:21] I'M GOING TO TELL YOU DEVIL, THE ONLY
[58:23] REASON YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS
[58:24] MY GOD ALLOWED IT AND IT'S FOR A
[58:26] PURPOSE.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BEFORE
[58:29] THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD IS THE
[58:31] SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT YOU WILL BEAR FRUIT
[58:34] AND YOUR FRUIT SHALL REMAIN.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; A SHEEP DOESN'T HAVE TO MANUFACTURE WOOL
[58:39] OR PUMP UP WOOL. THAT THAT SHEEP don't
[58:42] have to say, "BOY, I HOPE I CAN BEAR
[58:43] WOOL TODAY." HE DON'T have to do that.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; You know what he's got to do? Eat the
[58:47] grass
[58:48] &gt;&gt; and drink the water
[58:50] &gt;&gt; and live with the shepherd
[58:53] &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? You can take a sheep.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; He has all the potential to bear the
[58:58] wool.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; But you know what? If he's not in the
[59:00] right prov right environment all the
[59:02] time and if he ain't eating the word of
[59:03] God, if you're not keeping yourself in
[59:05] the right environment, that sheep will
[59:07] look sickly.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what's happened to a
[59:10] lot of the church of God. They look
[59:12] sickly
[59:13] &gt;&gt; when it comes to the manifestation of
[59:14] the word of God. It's not because they
[59:16] don't have the potential. That sheep's
[59:19] whole system inside of him is a sheep.
[59:21] Everything inside of him is already
[59:23] there. Every all the things that he
[59:25] needs to do to bear wool is already
[59:27] there. And I'm here to tell you, every
[59:28] single person I'm talking to you right
[59:30] now, every divine promise of the word of
[59:32] God is already inside you.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; All you got to do IS BELIEVE. THAT'S THE
[59:38] ONE THING, BROTHER, LISTEN TO ME. THAT'S
[59:39] WHAT SATAN IS TRYING TO ATTACK SO HARD
[59:42] AGAINST THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR OF
[59:43] PEOPLE AROUND THE CHURCH IS TO KEEP YOU
[59:45] FROM BELIEVING.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST WEAPON YOU HAVE IN THIS
[59:51] LIFE IS TO BELIEVE.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOW WHY YOU KNOW WHY DAVID WAS
[59:55] ABLE TO KILL THE LION AND THE BEAR? HE
[59:57] BELIEVED HE COULD DO IT.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY HE WAS ABLE TO SLIDE
[1:00:00] GOLIATH? HE BELIEVED HE COULD DO IT.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; AND YES, THAT'S WHY GOD'S TRYING TO GET
[1:00:06] HIS CHILDREN TO SAY, "YOU CAN DO IT.
[1:00:08] [screaming] YOU CAN DO THE GREATER
[1:00:10] WORKS.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST ME. YOU CAN DO IT BECAUSE
[1:00:13] YOU'VE GOT HIS LIFE INSIDE YOU.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; If you have it inside of you.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. Yes, sir.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Some of the greatest miracles I've seen
[1:00:22] God do is when I didn't feel like I had
[1:00:24] an ounce of faith.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; When I felt like I had nothing.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; And then God would do something and I
[1:00:29] was like, "How in the world did that
[1:00:30] just happen?"
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows what I'm talking
[1:00:33] about?
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:38] We must seek to be in the will of the
[1:00:40] spirit. You know a military is if a
[1:00:43] military is going to to take a mountain,
[1:00:46] every soldier has got to get in the same
[1:00:48] will.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; What do you mean, brother Daniel?
[1:00:55] That soldier cannot just take it up in
[1:00:57] himself and say, "You know what? I know
[1:00:59] they're want to take this mountain right
[1:01:00] here, but I said, let's go take this
[1:01:02] one. Let's go get it."
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; He's got a gun.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's got the the hat, got the
[1:01:08] combat boots.
[1:01:11] Let's go do it. I'm I'm going to go to
[1:01:12] you. I see this other mountain over
[1:01:14] here. I said, "Let's go take it." And he
[1:01:16] can go fight that. Even though he's got
[1:01:18] all the He's got the message book. He's
[1:01:19] got the Bible. He's got everything. I'm
[1:01:21] going to go take this mountain.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; He's got one thing wrong.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; God didn't tell him to do it.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; He did it. He's trying to do it himself.
[1:01:30] And when you try to do it in yourself,
[1:01:33] you will be alone
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; and you'll face the consequences.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; But listen me, when God tells him, you
[1:01:39] go take that mountain,
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; you go do that, you got the entire army,
[1:01:44] navy, air force,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; everything that is in the database is
[1:01:50] behind you.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; What do you mean, brother Daniel? You
[1:01:52] can't just go out there and say, I'm
[1:01:54] going to start laying hands on everybody
[1:01:55] I taught in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:56] The name of Jesus Christ. Name of Jesus
[1:01:58] Christ. You can do it all you want to.
[1:01:59] And hey, praise God, maybe something
[1:02:00] will happen. But I'm going to tell you
[1:02:02] something. When God tells you to do it,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; when God tells you, you go pray for that
[1:02:06] person.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; You go lay your hands on that person and
[1:02:09] you pray for that person. When you are
[1:02:11] doing that, what is that? It is all of
[1:02:13] heaven backing you up and saying, "I am
[1:02:15] backing you up. God, I will answer the
[1:02:17] prayer." It's not just you, brother.
[1:02:19] Listen to me. You, every one of you, I'm
[1:02:21] talking to you tonight. You are a
[1:02:22] soldier for the Lord.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord has not called you just to sit
[1:02:25] on a bench and fill space and blow air.
[1:02:28] God has called you for a purpose that
[1:02:30] God can use you. God can lead your life.
[1:02:34] God that you can testify the Lord is my
[1:02:36] shepherd. You'll be there sometimes,
[1:02:38] brother and sister, God will tell you,
[1:02:39] you pray for that baby. And you'll think
[1:02:41] to yourself, who am I to pray for that
[1:02:43] baby? Don't matter who you think you
[1:02:44] are. Pray for the baby.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm here to tell you when you do
[1:02:47] that, brother and sister, you can move a
[1:02:49] mountain that no great preacher, not
[1:02:50] even brother Windle may move that
[1:02:51] mountain because he didn't tell brother
[1:02:53] Windle to do it. He told you to do it
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; because it's obedience. WHENEVER YOU ARE
[1:02:57] WALKING, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? You are
[1:02:59] seeking the will of the father.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO ME. YOU AND YOU SOMETIMES YOU
[1:03:03] CAN HAVE ALL THE GIANTS ON TOP OF YOU.
[1:03:05] YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
[1:03:06] I GOT TO PAY THESE BILLS. I HAVE NO IDEA
[1:03:09] HOW I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THESE BILLS.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Give me a testimony.
[1:03:13] Okay.
[1:03:15] Well, back my wife and I, we were so
[1:03:17] strapped. We didn't know how in the
[1:03:18] world we're going to pay our bills
[1:03:19] ourself. And in yourself, you're like,
[1:03:21] God, how are we going to do this? Lord,
[1:03:22] we help you help do it. And then talking
[1:03:24] to somebody at work and they were
[1:03:25] saying, "I've got such as financial
[1:03:26] burden." Talking to a man and uh he
[1:03:28] said, "I just don't I hate my job. I
[1:03:30] don't want to do my job anymore." And I
[1:03:31] said, "I'm going to tell you what my God
[1:03:32] answers prayer. I believe we can pray
[1:03:34] and God will show you exactly where you
[1:03:35] need to go. My God is awesome." Few
[1:03:39] months ago, here I'm tell, Lord, how am
[1:03:40] I going to help my prayer? But here we
[1:03:41] over here speaking faith. You know, you
[1:03:42] ever felt that way? [laughter]
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; I told him, I'm telling you what, my God
[1:03:46] answers prayer. God will beat everything
[1:03:48] that you have need of. I'm telling you,
[1:03:49] he's he's just awesome. didn't sell him
[1:03:51] a car, but I got to talk to him about
[1:03:52] the Lord.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; He comes called me back about three
[1:03:56] weeks later. He said, "Hey, you going to
[1:03:57] be available? I'd like to talk to you."
[1:03:58] I said, "Yeah, absolutely. I think I'm
[1:03:59] going to buy a car from you. Come see
[1:04:01] me." He said, "Well, I got to give you a
[1:04:02] testimony, Brother Daniel." He said, "I
[1:04:04] didn't know what we were going to do
[1:04:05] when you told us that." And he said, "I
[1:04:07] took what you said. I told my wife said,
[1:04:09] "Let's just pray about it. We believe
[1:04:10] God's going to answer our prayer. God
[1:04:11] will meet our needs. I'm telling you,
[1:04:12] baby." He said, "This man was just
[1:04:14] telling it like it is." I think mind
[1:04:17] you, a few months ago, I was like, "I
[1:04:18] don't know how we're going to do this."
[1:04:19] Yeah.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And he said, I I told him, I said, I
[1:04:21] don't know. I said, I need to we need to
[1:04:23] take what he said and we need to run
[1:04:24] with that. I believe that a guy he don't
[1:04:26] even ever talk to at his church, a big
[1:04:27] goes to a big church apparently. A guy
[1:04:29] he never even talks to had been calling
[1:04:30] him and said that uh he said uh for
[1:04:33] about two weeks he called me over and
[1:04:34] over and over and he said I finally
[1:04:35] picked up the phone and called him back.
[1:04:37] I'm so sorry. I've been busy. He said,
[1:04:38] "Hey, I'm going to open up a new
[1:04:40] company." He said, "And I want you to
[1:04:43] lead the company." He said, "I'm giving
[1:04:45] you a new car. I'm giving you this
[1:04:46] finance. I'm giving you this. I'm giving
[1:04:48] it." He said, "Daniel," he said, "I
[1:04:49] NEVER THOUGHT I DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR IT."
[1:04:51] HE SAID, AND I SAID, "THAT'S MY GOD.
[1:04:54] THAT'S MY GOD." HE GOES, I GO, "OH MY
[1:04:56] LORD."
[1:04:58] [laughter]
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IN YOURSELF, YOU FEEL SO BEAT
[1:05:03] DOWN LIKE I DON'T GOT AN OUNCE OF FAITH
[1:05:04] AT ALL THAT I CAN DO IT. BUT BECAUSE
[1:05:06] YOU'RE YOUR IT'S NOT FOR YOU, IT'S FOR
[1:05:09] SOMEBODY ELSE. [screaming]
[1:05:10] WELL, A BODY DOESN'T LIVE FOR ITSELF. IT
[1:05:12] LIVES FOR THE REST OF THE BODY. AND
[1:05:14] LISTEN TO ME, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. YOU
[1:05:15] WANT TO HAVE VICTORY IN YOUR LIFE? START
[1:05:18] LIVING FOR THE BODY.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO THE CALLING THAT GOD PUT ON
[1:05:22] YOUR HEART BECAUSE GOD WILL WORK IN A
[1:05:24] DEEP CALL TO THE DEEP. GOD WILL INSPIRE
[1:05:25] YOUR HEART TO SAY A CERTAIN WORD AND
[1:05:28] SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE HUNGRY FOR THE
[1:05:30] VERY WORD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; It's a deep call to the deep.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And praise the Lord, the man got a new
[1:05:36] car and got him a new job.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:40] Sometimes whenever you feel like you
[1:05:42] ain't got an ounce of faith in the words
[1:05:44] that you're speaking, you don't even
[1:05:46] know what lives you're changing.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I'm fixing to get back on my text. I'm
[1:05:51] going to share something with you.
[1:05:54] The greatest witness that we give in
[1:05:56] this life is when we don't know people
[1:05:58] are watching us.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; It's easy to walk up right whenever
[1:06:02] someone's seeing us and let me put my
[1:06:05] head up and only believe.
[1:06:10] All things are possible because
[1:06:12] everyone's looking at you.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; But brother and sister, your greatest
[1:06:16] witness is when you don't know anyone's
[1:06:18] looking at you. That's
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; And you are going through the grind
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; and you're being a believer.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; You're living the life of a believer.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, every person
[1:06:28] I'm talking to right now in this life,
[1:06:30] you will go through trials. Well, you
[1:06:31] feel like God answering my prayers. I
[1:06:33] can't feel like I can't get no ground.
[1:06:34] I'm here to tell you God is trying you
[1:06:37] in front of the people. That's right.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; God is trying you to show the world what
[1:06:41] it means to be a believer.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's easy to be a believer and
[1:06:47] everything's going to good.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Window, if I give you a million
[1:06:50] dollars, come here, buddy.
[1:06:53] Give you a million dollars.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Look at the smile on this man's face.
[1:06:59] [laughter]
[1:07:00] I ain't got it, buddy.
[1:07:03] It It's easy. It would be easy to praise
[1:07:06] God. IT'D BE EASY TO SMILE. GAVE ME A
[1:07:08] MILLION DOLLARS. Praise God. THERE AIN'T
[1:07:11] NOBODY in here wouldn't BE SMILING IF I
[1:07:13] DIDN'T. THIS GUY RIGHT HERE, HE DON'T
[1:07:14] EVEN KNOW WHAT A MILLION DOLLARS IS.
[1:07:16] IT'S STILL smile
[1:07:20] cuz I GAVE A MILLION DOLLARS.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Brother and sister. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:07:25] GOD GAVE US SOMETHING WAY BETTER THAN A
[1:07:27] MILLION DOLLARS.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US HIS FELLOWSHIP.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US HIS FRIENDSHIP. GOD GAVE US
[1:07:33] SOMETHING THAT'S SO VALUABLE, SO MORE
[1:07:36] VALUABLE THAN ANYTHING. AND YOU KNOW
[1:07:38] WHAT? HE COULDN'T GIVE IT TO ANYBODY
[1:07:39] ELSE.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; BUT HE GAVE IT TO US.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; I THINK ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES ABOUT THE
[1:07:44] ARK. GOD DOES STRANGE. HE ASKED YOU TO
[1:07:46] do strange stuff sometimes.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; You think about when HE TOLD NOAH,
[1:07:49] "NOAH, I WANT YOU TO go build an ark.
[1:07:51] I'm going to cause rain to come from the
[1:07:52] sky. I want you to use this ark and I
[1:07:54] want you to use gopher wood." I want you
[1:07:56] to think about how ridiculous that must
[1:07:58] have looked to the people around him.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to go use water that so
[1:08:01] I'm going to use wood that soaks up
[1:08:02] water and I'm going to build up an ark,
[1:08:04] build all these animals on. It looks
[1:08:05] absolutely ridiculous.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; But what was God showing him? In order
[1:08:09] to prepare that ark for the flood, the
[1:08:11] judgment that was going to take place,
[1:08:13] you'd have to take another tree and beat
[1:08:15] the life out of that tree and then get
[1:08:18] that raisin and you would heat that
[1:08:19] raisin up. And because that gopher wood
[1:08:22] is so [snorts] thirsty, you could take
[1:08:24] that life and you can pour that life
[1:08:26] right into that gopher wood. And that
[1:08:29] gopher WOULD HAVE JUST SUCK IT RIGHT UP
[1:08:31] on the inside of it because it's so
[1:08:33] thirsty. You know, HE TOLD HIM, "YOU
[1:08:35] PITCH THAT THAT THAT ARC FROM THE INSIDE
[1:08:38] OUT." AND YOU KNOW, IT WAS THE IT WAS
[1:08:40] THE PITCH THAT IT SUCKED INSIDE OF IT IS
[1:08:43] ACTUALLY WHAT MADE IT STRONG.
[1:08:44] [screaming] WELL, WAS IT A TYPE OF JESUS
[1:08:46] CHRIST? THEY BEAT THE LIFE OUT OF JESUS
[1:08:49] CHRIST. BUT YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE LIKE YOU
[1:08:51] AND I [screaming] THAT ARE SO SO THIRSTY
[1:08:53] FOR THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. WHAT DID
[1:08:55] GOD DO? HE TOOK HIS LIFE AND POURED THAT
[1:08:58] LIFE INSIDE OF US. IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE
[1:09:00] OF US THAT SAYS, "I WANT THAT."
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. You find yourself, you
[1:09:04] know why a person smokes and drinks and
[1:09:07] does marijuana and does the things they
[1:09:08] do? You know why you do that? It's
[1:09:10] because you are thirsty for something.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; There's something inside of you that
[1:09:14] wants something. You're thirsting for
[1:09:16] something and you're trying to fill that
[1:09:17] call.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Don't give that to things
[1:09:20] to the world. Give that to God when you
[1:09:21] have that. Don't turn on another
[1:09:23] television show. Don't turn on another
[1:09:24] music. Listen to me. When you feel that
[1:09:26] THIRST ON THE INSIDE of you, IT'S
[1:09:28] BECAUSE GOD HAS GOT A DEEP CALL INSIDE
[1:09:30] YOUR HEART. He wants to put his life
[1:09:33] inside you.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And listen to me, it's the voided parts
[1:09:37] that he feels that's what made it
[1:09:38] strong.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; The pitch
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; and God wants us, God does it by a
[1:09:45] calling. Go listen to me. It never
[1:09:47] changes. God always leads his people by
[1:09:50] calling.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; He'll put a hunger and a thirst in you.
[1:09:53] hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:09:55] because whenever you're hunger and
[1:09:57] you're thirsting for something, you're
[1:09:58] going to eventually get up and do
[1:09:59] something about it. Listen to me. God is
[1:10:01] g he he will put a hunger and a thirst
[1:10:04] for you. If you have this hunger and
[1:10:06] thirst that I want more,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; I want more than what I'm settling for.
[1:10:12] Whenever Moses was calling the people
[1:10:14] out and they were going into the
[1:10:16] promised land, listen to me. Those
[1:10:17] people at at first they were crying,
[1:10:19] Lord, let us go worship God. Let us go
[1:10:21] worship God. I want to get out of here.
[1:10:23] God help me. And their calls reached a
[1:10:25] profit where God began to call the
[1:10:27] people out. But along the journey,
[1:10:29] somewhere along the way, friends, they
[1:10:31] got comfortable and they said, "You know
[1:10:33] what? Let's just build houses. Let's
[1:10:34] just do the things we're doing. We're
[1:10:35] just praising God. We got the words of a
[1:10:37] prophet." They were content. They didn't
[1:10:40] want to move forward. And listen to me
[1:10:42] in the same thing in the spiritual of
[1:10:44] the message of the hour. Many people
[1:10:46] been called out of the denominational
[1:10:47] system. You come out of those things and
[1:10:49] you going good. We're praising God.
[1:10:50] We're in the message of the hour. But
[1:10:52] they've got comfortable.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; We are not meant to stop here. God has
[1:10:57] called us all the way into the land to
[1:10:59] where you can positionally know who you
[1:11:01] are calling you from that to that other
[1:11:03] land. Brother and sister,
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; am I preaching to myself today? Y'all
[1:11:06] know what I'm talking about.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; It's a hunger and a thirst for a move of
[1:11:10] God. I pray that I don't ever get to a
[1:11:12] point to where I'm just can't intently
[1:11:13] just going to church. Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, we got a calling in
[1:11:18] our life, a calling in our midst to
[1:11:20] where we can reach that other side. But
[1:11:22] in order for you to get to the other
[1:11:23] side, you have got to be tried.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy. That's
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; There can be times whenever you see
[1:11:32] other people falling to the side,
[1:11:34] falling to the side, falling to the
[1:11:35] side. They used to worship God, praise
[1:11:37] God with you, and where they at? They
[1:11:39] begin to fall to the side, but you
[1:11:41] haven't fallen to the side.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to praise God whenever
[1:11:50] you're in the mountain tops.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; So easy when you got the million
[1:11:52] dollars, brother Window, the smile, but
[1:11:54] it's whenever you I don't even know how
[1:11:56] I'm going to pay my bills.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going to do this.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; What is it? Cuz you'll see somebody else
[1:12:02] that don't even try to serve God and God
[1:12:04] meets their needs.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; You see, they don't even try. I talked
[1:12:07] to a man yesterday. Don't even try. You
[1:12:08] know, he'll go out and do everything and
[1:12:10] uh and smoke and drink and do everything
[1:12:12] else and just say, "I just love it. I
[1:12:14] know I shouldn't be doing I do it
[1:12:15] anyway. Went to the gambling joint and
[1:12:17] come back with $6,000. So look at here.
[1:12:19] $6,000. What I want two two. The devil
[1:12:22] will try to use that to dangle that in
[1:12:23] front of you and say, "You know what?
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother."
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want the $6,000.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; I want the fellowship of my Lord.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Because that is more
[1:12:36] valuable than any money.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? That $6,000 ain't
[1:12:39] going to be worth very much anymore
[1:12:40] pretty soon. It's our fellowship with
[1:12:43] the Lord. Listen to me, brother. That de
[1:12:45] Listen to me, brothers. That that devil,
[1:12:47] the way he'll try to get you to do or
[1:12:48] sister, he'll try to put that you had
[1:12:50] that fence around your house.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And it's a privacy fence, right? And so
[1:12:55] they don't see what's going on inside
[1:12:56] your house. But you know what that devil
[1:12:58] will get you to do? Wonder what's on the
[1:13:00] other side of that fence.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; What's it, you know, you got your
[1:13:03] beautiful WIFE OR YOU GOT your beautiful
[1:13:06] HUSBAND RIGHT HERE. YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE
[1:13:07] GOT WHAT GOD GAVE YOU, BUT THAT DEVIL
[1:13:09] will dangle that across that fence. What
[1:13:11] if what's on the other side OF THAT
[1:13:14] FENCE?
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT IF I begin to peek through the
[1:13:17] THROUGH THE THROUGH THE WOOD AND BE ABLE
[1:13:18] TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THERE?
[1:13:20] THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST TOOLS OF THE
[1:13:22] DEVIL IS TO TRY TO HIT YOU a person.
[1:13:25] What are you missing?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; What else is over there?
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; that devil will dangle dangle dangle
[1:13:31] dangle WITH THE WORLD. THE SISTERS OF
[1:13:33] THIS WORLD. YOU HAVE GOT A A COMBAT
[1:13:35] WHERE THEY FIGHT EVERY DAY WITH THE SOUL
[1:13:37] OF THE WORLD WITH GLAMOUR AND HOLLYWOOD
[1:13:39] AND ALL THESE THINGS OF WOMEN THAT DON'T
[1:13:42] HAVE CHILDREN. WOMEN DON'T DO THAT. THEY
[1:13:43] KEEP THESE PERFECTLY PHYSIQUE BODIES IN
[1:13:46] FRONT OF AND [laughter] THAT TRY TO
[1:13:47] TORMENT THE WOMEN THAT'S THE SISTERS
[1:13:49] THAT ARE TRYING TO CARRY THE HOLINESS IN
[1:13:51] THIS HOUR. WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO?
[1:13:53] DEGRADE THEM, MAKE THEM THINK THEY'RE
[1:13:54] NOT PRETTY, YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
[1:13:56] YOU'RE NOT THAT. AND WHAT ARE THEY
[1:13:57] DOING? TRYING TO DANGLE IN FRONT OF THE
[1:13:58] SONS of God.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. where sons of God will get their
[1:14:01] eyes off of something that's so
[1:14:03] beautiful, so pure, SOMETHING SO HOLY
[1:14:05] THAT GOD GAVE YOU AS A GIFT. AND YOU
[1:14:08] HE'S GOING TO YOU'RE HE'S GOING TO TRY
[1:14:09] TO TURN YOUR EYES OVER. LOOK AT THIS
[1:14:11] WORLDLY THING.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; It's vice versa for the man and the
[1:14:14] woman and the man.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Satan does not change his tactics.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Eve had everything that she needed in
[1:14:22] Adam.
[1:14:24] fellowship, a man of God, a man that
[1:14:28] loves the Lord, a man that was upright,
[1:14:32] a man that treated her right.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And what did he do? Dangle this other
[1:14:38] guy out there, the serpent.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Dangled this guy out there to get
[1:14:42] something else. Listen to me. That's how
[1:14:45] he did it back then. The devil's trying
[1:14:47] to do the same thing now. And listen,
[1:14:48] listen what brother Daniel's trying to
[1:14:49] tell you. God has given us a pure,
[1:14:52] absolute, holy message. Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; God has shown us what's true. And rather
[1:14:56] than staying with what's true, that
[1:14:58] devil is trying to get you to turn your
[1:15:00] eyes off of that pure thing over to
[1:15:02] something else that's more pretty,
[1:15:04] something that's more beautiful, just a
[1:15:05] beautiful worship. We don't have to
[1:15:07] preach against the way you dress
[1:15:08] anymore. We don't have to preach about
[1:15:10] those things. We don't have to preach
[1:15:11] against hair anymore. We don't have to
[1:15:12] do that anymore. That stinking devil

[1:15:28] [screaming] SO HARD TO TEMPT FROM WHAT'S
[1:15:30] PURE AND HOLY THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO YOU
[1:15:32] TO SUBSTITUTE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE. WE

[1:16:24] HATCH ANYTHING
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT HEN HAS GOT TO BE WITH THE
[1:16:28] ROOSTER BECAUSE THE MALE IS WHAT CAUSES
[1:16:32] THAT [screaming] THAT THAT HEN TO BE
[1:16:34] ABLE TO NOT JUST LAY AN EGG, BUT LAY AN
[1:16:36] EGG THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BEAR
[1:16:38] BIRTHS. [screaming]
[1:16:39] AND LISTEN TO ME, BROTHER AND SISTER. WE
[1:16:41] DON'T WANT JUST CHURCH MEMBERSHIP. WE
[1:16:43] DON'T WANT JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE COMING

[1:16:49] ROOSTER JESUS CHRIST THAT WILL DRAMATIZE
[1:16:52] YOU ON THE INSIDE OF YOU WHERE YOU CAN
[1:16:54] HAVE A GENUINE NEW BIRTH.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE
[1:16:59] MESSAGE AROUND THE MESSAGE. [screaming]
[1:17:00] PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING BORN AGAIN. YOU
[1:17:02] TAKE THE FORM OF A CHURCH, THEY'LL SERVE
[1:17:04] GOD FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY QUIT.
[1:17:06] [screaming] WHY? THEY NEVER GOT BORN
[1:17:08] AGAIN. COME ON.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU GET BORN
[1:17:10] AGAIN, YOU CAN'T GO BACK. [laughter]
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING YOU NEED TO GO BACK.
[1:17:14] YOU'VE BEEN TRANSFORMED.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? IN GARDENING, YOU CAN
[1:17:21] TAKE, YOU KNOW WHAT A A PICKLE IS? It's
[1:17:23] a cucumber.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TAKE THAT CUCUMBER,
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; PUT IT IN THE SOLUTION.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And you pull it out. It'll smell like a
[1:17:33] a pickle. You can taste like a pickle on
[1:17:37] the outside.
[1:17:39] But bite into it.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; It's still a cucumber.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You got to put it in the sauce a little
[1:17:45] longer.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Pull it out. Smells more like a pickle.
[1:17:52] Still tastes like a pickle.
[1:17:55] Still a cucumber.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, you let it
[1:18:00] stay in the solution.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; You let it terry inside that beautiful
[1:18:06] juice. And that juice that it is
[1:18:09] carrying in will be the very juice that
[1:18:11] transform it from a cucumber into a
[1:18:14] pickle. And then once that thing is
[1:18:16] transformed into a pickle, it can never
[1:18:17] go back to being a cucumber. Even though
[1:18:19] it even if it wanted to, but why would
[1:18:21] it want to?
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you that's the way it
[1:18:23] is with the son and daughter of God. If
[1:18:25] we will carry IN THE JUICE OF THE HOLY
[1:18:27] GHOST, BROTHER AND SISTER, NOT JUST FOR
[1:18:29] ONE DAY, NOT FOR JUST TWO WEEKS, NOT FOR
[1:18:32] JUST ONE YEAR. STAY IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:18:35] SEEK HIS WILL. OH, GOD, [screaming]
[1:18:37] TRANSFORM ME FROM THE INSIDE OUT. I WANT
[1:18:40] IT TO BE. WHENEVER SEE ANYTHING BITES
[1:18:42] INTO ME, IT SAYS THAT'S A SON OF GOD.
[1:18:45] THAT'S THE real deal. CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:18:48] JUST HAVING THAT PICKLE WITHOUT
[1:18:49] PRESSURE, YOU YOU CAN FOOL PEOPLE.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; You can FOOL PEOPLE. YOU TAKE THAT
[1:18:54] CUCUMBER and stick IT IN THAT JUICE, YOU
[1:18:56] CAN fool people and think that's a
[1:18:57] cucumber. It's been transformed. But you
[1:18:59] take you cause things to break that
[1:19:01] thing open and you'll find out what's on
[1:19:04] the inside. And listen to me. Whenever
[1:19:06] we are tried, brother and sister,
[1:19:08] whenever you're going through the fire,
[1:19:10] you're going to be crushed sometimes so
[1:19:12] squeezed so hard you can't. You feel
[1:19:15] like all the life is being squeezed out
[1:19:16] of you, but all that's coming out is the
[1:19:19] rose of Sharon.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Sweet savor of the Lord. Something
[1:19:23] inside you said, "I don't know why I'm
[1:19:25] going through what I'm going through,
[1:19:26] but I know one thing. I love the Lord. I
[1:19:30] love him. I just want to SERVE HIM. HE'S
[1:19:33] BEEN SO GOOD TO ME. Everything I've
[1:19:35] got's gone. I I don't know what I'm
[1:19:37] going to do about him. But one thing I
[1:19:38] know, I love him. If he cast me into
[1:19:41] hell, I love him. If he takes me up
[1:19:44] there, I'll love him. LISTEN TO ME.
[1:19:46] THAT'S ALL GOD WANTS. HE WANTS A GOD, A
[1:19:48] PEOPLE THAT LOVE HIM. NO MATTER WHAT,
[1:19:50] GOD, I LOVE YOU. I WANT TO SERVE YOU,
[1:19:53] LORD. LISTEN. WE DON'T WANT TO TRY TO BE
[1:19:54] SOMETHING BIG. BE SOMETHING SMALL. YOU
[1:19:56] KNOW, A BE A LITTLE SPLINTER THAT GOD
[1:19:59] CAN USE TO START A FIRE. DON'T TRY TO BE
[1:20:01] THIS BIG DESK. BE SOMETHING SMALL. BE A
[1:20:04] LITTLE SPLINTER. SAY, "GOD, LET MY
[1:20:07] LITTLE SPLINTER OF MY LIFE BE A FIRE FOR
[1:20:10] SOMEBODY ELSE." LORD, LET THEM BE THE
[1:20:12] BIG FIRE. I DON'T NEED TO BE THE BIG
[1:20:14] FIRE. I JUST WANT YOU TO BE LIFTED UP.
[1:20:16] LORD, IF I IF THAT THAT'S MY MISSION IN
[1:20:19] THIS LIFE IS JUST TO BE A SPLINTER. I
[1:20:21] WANT TO BE A HAPPY SPLINTER. I WANT TO
[1:20:23] DO IT [screaming] WITH PRIDE. I WANT TO
[1:20:25] DO IT WITH JOY. NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE
[1:20:27] DOING, WHAT IF YOUR CALLING IS TO HOLD
[1:20:30] THAT DOOR OPEN FOR THE CHURCH,
[1:20:31] [screaming] DO IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO IT WITH
[1:20:36] THE LOVE OF GOD. EVERY DAY WHEN YOU WAKE
[1:20:38] UP, PRAY, "LORD, LET ME BE USED BY YOU
[1:20:41] TODAY. HELP ME TO REACH SOMEBODY AT THE
[1:20:43] STORE TODAY. LET ME BE THE LIGHT TODAY."
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; LISTEN to me. THAT'S OUR CALLING.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; THAT IS YOUR CALLING as a son and
[1:20:51] daughter of God to express the mercy
[1:20:54] that God put in your life. Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; I was talking to a man the other day,
[1:20:59] yesterday.
[1:21:00] Lost everything.
[1:21:03] He was real bitter at verses. I was
[1:21:05] selling his brother
[1:21:07] a truck.
[1:21:09] Had his brother with him
[1:21:12] and uh
[1:21:14] forgive me.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; He was a free will Baptist pastor
[1:21:20] selling him a truck. He said, "That's my
[1:21:23] brother over there." I said, "Oh, okay.
[1:21:26] Awesome." And I know he kept staying
[1:21:27] kept standing away from me. He didn't
[1:21:28] want to talk to me very much. And uh
[1:21:30] after a little bit, I just tried to be
[1:21:32] kind to him best I could. And it come
[1:21:34] time to finance part where he went to
[1:21:35] the finance office and I just kept
[1:21:37] trying to spread my kindness over to
[1:21:38] him. I got him to sit down at my desk,
[1:21:42] thus
[1:21:44] to talk to him a little bit. And I could
[1:21:46] see this stone cold
[1:21:48] around him.
[1:21:50] And I don't know how to explain it, but
[1:21:53] God's presence began to come down right
[1:21:55] there where we're at. And I I told him,
[1:21:56] I said, "I'm going to tell you
[1:21:57] something." I leaned my chair back. I
[1:21:59] said, "I don't know what you're going
[1:22:01] through, but my God loves you. And this
[1:22:05] man's turned his eyes just into tears."
[1:22:07] And he said, "I know he does. My brother
[1:22:10] tells me that all the time. I know he
[1:22:12] does." He said, "But so many things have
[1:22:14] gone wrong, and I don't understand why.
[1:22:16] All these different things." I said,
[1:22:17] "Buddy, I don't know why bad things
[1:22:18] happen. I'll be honest with you. I
[1:22:20] honestly don't know. There's some things
[1:22:23] that we won't know till we get to that
[1:22:24] other side.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I said, "But one thing I know
[1:22:28] I love him."
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And the man turned his chair. He liked
[1:22:32] that. Just tears in his eyes. He said,
[1:22:33] "I know it sounds crazy, but I want to
[1:22:35] be angry with God so bad." He said, "But
[1:22:37] something inside me makes me love him."
[1:22:40] I said, "That's because you're a son of
[1:22:41] God."
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, brother. We need to be
[1:22:44] reminded sometimes you are a son of God.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. You are a daughter of God.
[1:22:49] I know you've been going through a
[1:22:51] trial. I know you've been going through
[1:22:52] these things, but listen to me. My God
[1:22:54] loves you.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; My God has not forgotten about you. He
[1:22:57] knows right where you are. He will get
[1:22:59] right eyeball level with you. He will
[1:23:01] meet with you. I want to challenge you
[1:23:04] today that when you leave this place
[1:23:06] that you will not just leave like
[1:23:07] another church service, but may you be
[1:23:09] inspired by the love of God inside your
[1:23:11] heart that you will give that love to
[1:23:14] somebody else. Spread the blanket of
[1:23:16] love around somebody. Spread the blanket
[1:23:19] of grace around somebody. It's not we're
[1:23:21] right AND YOU'RE WRONG. WE'RE ALL wrong
[1:23:22] without him.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; We need him. HE'S THE ONE THAT DID IT.
[1:23:26] HE'S THE SAVIOR. HE'S THE SHEPHERD. ALL
[1:23:28] WE [screaming] GOT TO DO IS FOCUS ON
[1:23:29] HIM.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENNHAM TALKED ABOUT THE MAN
[1:23:32] TRYING TO SELL A HAMMER. HE SAID, "YOU
[1:23:34] DON'T GO TO THAT GUY AND SAY, "GET THAT
[1:23:35] JUNKY HAMMER OUT OF HERE. USE A man's
[1:23:37] hammer." He didn't really use say that's
[1:23:38] that's basically what he was saying.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; It's all about presentation. When you do
[1:23:41] that, be that's a nice hammer. Oh,
[1:23:43] that's nice. Can I see it? Oh, that's a
[1:23:45] good hammer. Why don't you try this one?
[1:23:47] It's all about presentation and listen
[1:23:50] to me and selling, brother and sister.
[1:23:51] You know why a lot of people don't sell
[1:23:53] the product? They're not selling it
[1:23:54] right. They're not demonstrating it
[1:23:56] right. Let me show you something. When I
[1:23:58] was little, I used to love using a spit
[1:23:59] stone. I thought I'd use my knife and I
[1:24:02] [sighs] Anybody ever do that? There one
[1:24:05] of you. This whole congregation.
[1:24:07] Two. What a shame. Three. That's one of
[1:24:11] the greatest joys of my life.
[1:24:14] little spit stone. I'd take that knife
[1:24:17] and I'd put that thing on that stone,
[1:24:18] brother and sister, and I'd just glide
[1:24:19] that thing just ever so gently, and you
[1:24:25] There's something else that works even
[1:24:26] better than spit, and that's oil.
[1:24:29] When you put that oil on top of that
[1:24:31] stone,
[1:24:32] you can slowly glide that knife across
[1:24:34] that thing. Just slow, ever so gently,
[1:24:37] and you do at the right angle because
[1:24:38] you can use the the right stone, the
[1:24:41] right knife, but when you do it wrong,
[1:24:44] you'll run that blade.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And the message of the hour is a stone.
[1:24:49] It's a revelation.
[1:24:51] Got the word of God.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And you can take that word with the
[1:24:54] message of the hour. And if you go at
[1:24:56] that thing with the wrong angle, you
[1:24:57] will run the effect of that knife. And
[1:25:00] brother and sister, we do not want to do
[1:25:01] that in ourselves of taking this message
[1:25:04] because we're using the wrong approach
[1:25:05] to other people and you're hurting them
[1:25:07] more than helping them.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; But when you do it the right way,
[1:25:11] brother, you can take the word and the
[1:25:12] message of y, it'll make that thing cut
[1:25:14] deeper than you ever thought. You'll see
[1:25:16] scriptures and it's like, "Oh my gosh, I
[1:25:17] have seen that my whole life. I've never
[1:25:19] seen that before." What it is, it's the
[1:25:21] approach. You got to have the right
[1:25:24] approach to the word. And listen to me,
[1:25:26] brother and sister. You you want the
[1:25:27] right approach to the word of this
[1:25:29] message in your life in holiness. When
[1:25:31] we will approach it in the right way,
[1:25:33] we'll get the right effect.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I want to say this very clearly. Listen
[1:25:36] to what I'm saying. You can use a
[1:25:38] perfectly good knife, a perfectly good
[1:25:41] stone, but when you approach it the
[1:25:43] wrong way, you will run that blade. And
[1:25:46] that's a lot of people have done that.
[1:25:48] They've hurt people rather than helping
[1:25:50] them
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; because of the wrong approach. Listen to
[1:25:53] me. Jesus was kind. But there come time
[1:25:56] he pulled out the whips.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; But who did he call out the whips to?
[1:26:01] The people that were defying him.
[1:26:05] You listen at different times where
[1:26:06] brother Brener preached on certain
[1:26:07] things. He would hammer those women just
[1:26:09] as hard as can be. Boy, you look at
[1:26:11] another he's just as kind as can be.
[1:26:13] What is it? Because he is the situation
[1:26:15] that he is in. And sometime there'd be a
[1:26:18] woman playing the piano that maybe her
[1:26:19] blouse wasn't exactly right, but he said
[1:26:21] she's got the right spirit.
[1:26:25] He didn't bash that woman. She had the
[1:26:27] right spirit. Listen, listen to what
[1:26:29] brother Daniel's trying to say to you.
[1:26:30] Let's strive to have the right spirit.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? If you get the
[1:26:36] right spirit, everything else will work
[1:26:37] out.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Seek to be in the right spirit. Lord,
[1:26:40] help me to have the right demeanor to
[1:26:42] where someone's around me, they say,
[1:26:44] "You know what? I may not agree with
[1:26:45] what you have to say, but you got the
[1:26:46] right spirit." Do y'all know if somebody
[1:26:48] else that someone said that to?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham, I may not agree with
[1:26:53] you, but you sure got the spirit of
[1:26:55] Christ.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; You know, if we're following that same
[1:26:58] message, we should be the same fruit.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham talked about on that
[1:27:05] other side, he said it was a love beyond
[1:27:09] sublime.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; that happens on this side.
[1:27:14] We don't just all of a sudden get
[1:27:16] transformed from this old bitter thing
[1:27:17] that we are to the sweet loving thing
[1:27:19] over there. It happens on this side.
[1:27:22] It's a love that comes. A love that
[1:27:24] bulls out for the starchiness that all
[1:27:26] this stuff comes. You know what brother
[1:27:28] Ram said will bull all that out. Love,
[1:27:32] a divine love. A love that will just
[1:27:35] come inside you and burn out and bull
[1:27:38] out. Because I'm tell you what, when
[1:27:39] you're in his presence, you can't look
[1:27:40] down on anybody. Am I telling the truth?
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talked about when in order
[1:27:45] for him to pray for somebody, he said,
[1:27:46] "I got to be able to get in their shoes.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I got to feel what they're feeling."
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Because when you can really get their
[1:27:52] feeling, you can meet the meet the meet
[1:27:54] it on their level. And listen, I'm
[1:27:56] challenge you as your brother today.
[1:27:58] Strive to have that love for your
[1:28:01] brother and your sister.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Because the devil will anoint people to
[1:28:06] irritate you.
[1:28:10] There's some people you just love to be
[1:28:11] around. Just love it. Like be around s
[1:28:14] brother Robert, sister Banna. Just just
[1:28:16] just love them. Cut from the same cloth.
[1:28:20] You get some other people like man.
[1:28:22] Praise God. A little that goes a long
[1:28:24] way. I don't mean that in a bad way.
[1:28:26] Point that to oursel. We don't want that
[1:28:28] to be us to where we got to be careful
[1:28:30] because we put off an atmosphere.
[1:28:32] We put off an atmosphere and that
[1:28:34] atmosphere is what you think about, what
[1:28:36] you talk about. There's some people
[1:28:37] you're around them and you say, "Hey,
[1:28:39] how you doing?" And you just ask the
[1:28:40] wrong words cuz you're there for 15
[1:28:42] minutes of telling you everything that's
[1:28:43] wrong in the county.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; I had a brother one time. He's still
[1:28:49] alive. Bless his heart.
[1:28:53] [laughter]
[1:28:54] I didn't mean it like that.
[1:28:57] He's a good brother.
[1:29:01] But I had I worked at a tire shop. And
[1:29:03] he'd come to say, "Brother Daniel, I
[1:29:05] want to talk to you." Said, "I we need
[1:29:07] to we need to pray about a prayer
[1:29:08] request." I said, "Okay, yeah,
[1:29:10] absolutely. We'll pray about it." And he
[1:29:11] began to tell me everything that was
[1:29:12] wrong about the person. And it it wasn't
[1:29:15] he wanted prayer. He wanted to talk
[1:29:17] about somebody.
[1:29:19] You know, these words, when you speak
[1:29:21] bad about somebody behind their back,
[1:29:22] it's not killing them.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You're killing their influence.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And listen to me. We should never sit in
[1:29:27] a room and let our brother's name hit
[1:29:29] the ground.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz when we do that, it's just like
[1:29:32] murder.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me about the love of Jesus
[1:29:34] Christ and then the same mount start
[1:29:36] running your brother down in the dirt.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; And I love this brother. I I don't mean
[1:29:40] this as a bashing. I'm the only way I
[1:29:41] know how to get the point across. Okay?
[1:29:43] Every day come back to, "Hey, brother
[1:29:44] Dan, want to talk about this?" Didn't
[1:29:46] have a thing about prayer request. I
[1:29:47] want to talk about somebody. So, I let
[1:29:49] him get through his spill about what it
[1:29:51] was. I said, "Hey, brother, we're going
[1:29:52] to pray for this need and then we're
[1:29:54] going to pray for you. We're going to
[1:29:55] pray that God will help you seeing all
[1:29:57] from seeing all the bad stuff in
[1:29:59] everybody. And we began to pray and we
[1:30:01] prayed for him and I prayed God to live
[1:30:03] him. But you know what? He never come
[1:30:04] back and do that again.
[1:30:07] Sometimes in an awkward situation, it's
[1:30:10] very awkward whenever someone wants to
[1:30:11] run somebody down. When you have to stop
[1:30:13] and say, "I don't want to talk like
[1:30:14] this."
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; It's very uncomfortable. But let me
[1:30:18] challenge you. Do it.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, turn the conversation. Hey, say
[1:30:24] something nice about them. In time
[1:30:26] someone starts talking bad about that
[1:30:28] brother, you find something nice about
[1:30:29] them. You speak something good about
[1:30:30] them because that is your brother. That
[1:30:33] is your sister. And we are running this
[1:30:35] same race trying to get to that other
[1:30:36] side.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. That right there will fix
[1:30:39] a lot of problem in churches
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; is stopping that gossip
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; because bad gossip, there's good gossip
[1:30:45] and there's bad gossip. That's probably
[1:30:46] not the word. It's probably testifying,
[1:30:48] right?
[1:30:49] Talking good about somebody.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; But listen to me. when you're using the
[1:30:53] bad words and bashing somebody. That's
[1:30:55] why I love you guys. I know that if
[1:30:56] someone tried to speak bad about brother
[1:30:58] Daniel, my brother say, "Hey,
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; he can't sing worth a lick, but I like
[1:31:04] it." [laughter]
[1:31:06] You got to find something to say like,
[1:31:08] "Well, I got that." [laughter]
[1:31:12] This is one of those icky situations.
[1:31:13] I'm trying to get out of it.
[1:31:16] Amen. I believe the bride does not
[1:31:17] persecute bride.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. doves. You will not see them. I
[1:31:22] remember we lived in Elma, Arkansas. I
[1:31:24] be I was watching I was going to the
[1:31:26] there were time just sitting there
[1:31:27] talking to the Lord and I think I was
[1:31:28] whittling a stick at the time sitting
[1:31:30] there just cutting sitting on the front
[1:31:31] porch. I was looking up over there and I
[1:31:33] saw this uh dove sitting out there and
[1:31:35] just being what it was just being a dove
[1:31:37] and you know the what however the noise
[1:31:39] they do just being as them and just so
[1:31:42] beautiful. Have you ever noticed that
[1:31:43] doves are so elegant, so beautiful, and
[1:31:46] all of a sudden these other birds come
[1:31:48] over there and tried to attack that
[1:31:50] dove?
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; And that little dove finally just flew
[1:31:54] straight away and just got away from
[1:31:56] him.
[1:31:58] And the Lord spoke to me and said,
[1:31:59] "That's exactly the way it is with us.
[1:32:02] You're trying to serve the Lord the best
[1:32:04] you can and people come over there and
[1:32:06] try to pick at you and pick at you and
[1:32:08] pick at you. It's not them. It's a
[1:32:09] stinking spirit
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; that comes on that person.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; When that person's tearing you down,
[1:32:14] it's because there's a spirit on them.
[1:32:16] They don't mean to do it. It's a spirit
[1:32:17] on them.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; So, don't look bad at that person when
[1:32:20] they're doing it. Pray that God will
[1:32:21] help them with that spirit that's trying
[1:32:23] to come on you. But listen to me. If you
[1:32:25] entertain that spirit long enough, that
[1:32:27] spirit will come on you.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Spirits travel. Spirits don't die.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; They just change dwelling places.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. We don't want those
[1:32:37] things. We we want the Holy Spirit
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; where that Holy Spirit will come and you
[1:32:41] bring a refreshment to somebody.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; We don't be a bitter cactus.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; You know a cactus, you know what's wrong
[1:32:47] with a cactus? You get close to them,
[1:32:49] they pick at you. They stick at you. I
[1:32:51] remember when I was when I was a boy, I
[1:32:52] was riding a horse. We used to
[1:32:55] I got to tell the whole story.
[1:33:00] I was country. We lived in the country.
[1:33:04] I was riding in nothing but my boxers on
[1:33:06] top of this horse. No rains, no nothing.
[1:33:09] I'm just free. I'm riding this horse way
[1:33:11] in the back and I go real sharp around
[1:33:14] the curve and it was a racing horse and
[1:33:16] it had literal horsepower. When he would
[1:33:18] take off, you would literally hit the
[1:33:19] ground. So, you have to hang on to it. I
[1:33:22] was riding this horse out in the wild
[1:33:23] doing my own business and it did a sharp
[1:33:25] turn and threw me inside this cactus
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; from head to toe cactus and my mom had
[1:33:32] to hold me down.
[1:33:36] Every single one of those and it was a
[1:33:39] tough lesson for me.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you I didn't do
[1:33:42] that again.
[1:33:45] Sometimes God will allow you to get
[1:33:47] thrown off the horse and throw you into
[1:33:49] a cactus
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; and you got to endure the picking of the
[1:33:53] cactus.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I can say, "Oh, God, forgive me. I
[1:33:56] didn't mean to do it." No, God forgives
[1:33:58] you. But he don't take the cactus out.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; You got to endure it. You will reap what
[1:34:04] you sow.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. If you want you want good
[1:34:07] things to happen in your life, sew good
[1:34:09] things.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; You can't sew bad seed in your life and
[1:34:12] expect a harvest of good things. It's
[1:34:14] not going to work.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; You know what? You'll reap what you sow.
[1:34:17] You can say, "God, forgive me." You You
[1:34:18] know what? Whenever you get into a lot
[1:34:20] of debt, you can say, "God, forgive me.
[1:34:21] I love you, Lord, and the Lord forgive
[1:34:23] you." You can call that credit card,
[1:34:24] say, "Hey, I'm going to tell you
[1:34:26] something. I gave my heart to the Lord,
[1:34:28] and he forgave me of it all."
[1:34:31] That that credit card guy ain't going to
[1:34:33] say, "We do, too. Bless God. I wish they
[1:34:37] did."
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; How many knows what I'm talking about?
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; I'm eyeball level with you. Yeah,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Lord. PRAISE JESUS. HE SET ME FREE.
[1:34:48] [laughter]
[1:34:49] Credit card says, "Yeah, your payment's
[1:34:51] due on the 15th."
[1:34:54] You still got to reap what you sow.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll sow bad seed and you
[1:34:58] still got to reap it.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; But the difference is you're back in
[1:35:02] fellowship with your maker.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, listen to me. That's
[1:35:06] the most important thing you have in
[1:35:07] this life is his fellowship.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And he can wipe it away anytime he wants
[1:35:11] to. Yeah,
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; the Lord can do it. He can wipe away any
[1:35:14] he wants to. But don't focus on God
[1:35:16] wiping your debt about focus on Lord, I
[1:35:19] want your fellowship.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I just want to read one more scripture
[1:35:33] and we're we're going to try to close.
[1:35:34] Okay. In Isaiah 55:es 8-11, he says,
[1:35:38] "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[1:35:40] neither are your ways my ways, sayeth
[1:35:41] the Lord. For as the heavens are higher
[1:35:43] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[1:35:45] than your ways, and my thoughts than
[1:35:47] your thoughts. For as the rain cometh
[1:35:49] down, and the snow from heaven runth not
[1:35:51] thither, but waterth the earth, and make
[1:35:53] it to bring forth in bud, that it may
[1:35:55] give seed to the sewer, and bread to the
[1:35:57] eater, so shall my word be that goeth
[1:36:00] forth out of my mouth. It shall not
[1:36:02] return unto me void, but it shall
[1:36:04] accomplish that which I please, and it
[1:36:07] shall prosper in the thing there, I sent
[1:36:10] it. And I want to say this to you,
[1:36:12] brother and sister. God has sent you for
[1:36:15] a purpose. And you will fulfill your
[1:36:19] purpose. His word's not going to return
[1:36:21] to him void. Your mission in this life,
[1:36:23] you are right where God wants you to be.
[1:36:25] God knew exactly where you are right
[1:36:27] now. You're right on time with the Lord.
[1:36:29] So right here, right now, no matter what
[1:36:32] your circumstance, say, "Lord, right
[1:36:33] here, I want to be in your will." And
[1:36:36] you let God reach the target. Amen.
[1:36:38] Let's all stand.
[1:36:44] I want to read another scripture in St.
[1:36:45] John 15 16. He says, "You have not
[1:36:49] chosen me, but I have chosen you and
[1:36:51] ordained you that you should go forth
[1:36:54] and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:36:56] fruit should remain that whatsoever ye
[1:37:00] shall ask of my father in my name, he
[1:37:03] will give it to you."
[1:37:06] And one last quote, he says, "Now you
[1:37:08] got truth, but you've got to come to it
[1:37:11] in a different than just a big hilarity.
[1:37:13] You know what I mean? Just something to
[1:37:15] be hollering about. and I believe in
[1:37:17] hollering about it has got something to
[1:37:19] holler about.
[1:37:21] But be sure you approach that with the
[1:37:24] very depths of sincerity. If you live a
[1:37:27] different life than what you should
[1:37:29] live, keep still until you get that
[1:37:31] life. Get it get that life gets to
[1:37:35] living you then automatically. You know
[1:37:37] a sheep isn't asked to manufacture wool.
[1:37:40] No, he can't manufacture it. These gifts
[1:37:43] cannot be manufactured by emotion. This
[1:37:46] church cannot be manufactured by
[1:37:48] organization. A sheep bears wool because
[1:37:51] he is a sheep. He can't help bearing
[1:37:54] wool for his whole system is made to
[1:37:57] bear wool. But we but must be what we
[1:38:00] are on the inside out.
[1:38:04] You take any apple seed and any whenever
[1:38:09] you put that seed into the ground, it's
[1:38:11] going to bear apples. And every apple
[1:38:14] that will ever be produced is already
[1:38:18] inside [music] that seed. And listen to
[1:38:20] me, that's exactly the way it is with
[1:38:22] us, brother and sister. Every divine
[1:38:24] promise of God is already inside you. I
[1:38:28] believe this with all my heart,
[1:38:29] including our body change.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going to do it.
[1:38:34] that little apple seed. He can look at
[1:38:36] that whenever that seed, you can you can
[1:38:39] talk to that little seed if you were and
[1:38:40] say, "You're going to bear just the
[1:38:42] prettiest big apple tree you've ever
[1:38:43] seen. You're going to bear fruit. You're
[1:38:45] going to bear apples. You're that you
[1:38:47] could talk to that seed and if that seed
[1:38:49] was to be able to speak to you without a
[1:38:51] doubt, he'd say, "I don't think I can do
[1:38:53] it. I don't think I can do it. I I don't
[1:38:56] feel any faith. I don't feel anything."
[1:38:58] But you know what? the person that's
[1:39:00] speaking to the seed, he already knows
[1:39:02] what it is capable of. He'll say, "Yes,
[1:39:05] you can. You can do it because I'm going
[1:39:08] I'm the one doing it." That person can
[1:39:10] put that seed inside the ground and put
[1:39:12] it in the right environment. And that
[1:39:14] seed may feel like I don't have the
[1:39:16] faith to do it. I don't know what I
[1:39:18] don't know how I'm ever going to bear an
[1:39:19] apple because I don't feel like an apple
[1:39:21] tree. But you know what? When you put
[1:39:23] the seed in the right environment,
[1:39:25] brother, sister, THERE IS A POWER THAT
[1:39:26] HAPPENS on the inside of that seed. AND
[1:39:29] IT CAUSES A TRANSFORMATION
[1:39:31] AUTOMATICALLY. And listen to me, that's
[1:39:33] the way it is with a son or daughter of
[1:39:34] God. WHEN YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE RIGHT
[1:39:37] ENVIRONMENT, THE WOOL WILL COME
[1:39:39] AUTOMATICALLY. THE FRUITS WILL COME
[1:39:41] AUTOMATICALLY. THE MANIFESTATIONS WILL
[1:39:43] COME AUTOMATICALLY. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A
[1:39:45] POWER ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. EVERY PERSON
[1:39:47] I'M TALKING TO, YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL.
[1:39:50] WE SING A SONG. WE'VE GOT the power.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's him. It's the YOU HAVE
[1:39:57] IT INSIDE OF YOU THAT CAN CAUSE HEALING,
[1:39:59] THAT CAN CAUSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT
[1:40:01] HAPPEN. BUT THE GREATEST THING, BROTHER
[1:40:02] and sister, is your transformation of a
[1:40:04] body change.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; If I was to ask you, so tell you right
[1:40:08] now, you're going to have a body change.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; You're going to take a rapture.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; It's so easy in yourself, I don't feel
[1:40:17] like I can do it.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I can do it. I don't
[1:40:20] have any faith. I don't have this. I
[1:40:22] don't have that. I don't have it. It
[1:40:23] don't have a thing with what you have.
[1:40:26] It's God. Listen to me. That shepherd's
[1:40:29] the one that saves the sheep. We forget
[1:40:32] that somewhere along the line, we think
[1:40:34] that we're the one that's saving oursel.
[1:40:36] No, it's him.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; He's our shepherd. And we will listen to
[1:40:40] him. He will lead us to the still
[1:40:44] waters.
[1:40:45] He will lead you to where? To the grass
[1:40:48] where you can eat the word. And whenever
[1:40:51] you eat that word, brother and sister,
[1:40:54] the fruits will come automatically. And
[1:40:58] I'm telling you, I believe this with all
[1:40:59] my heart. I believe it's so simple.
[1:41:02] People are overlooking it. The
[1:41:03] simplicity of the rapture is going to be
[1:41:05] so simple.
[1:41:08] It's not because we're trying to pump
[1:41:09] something up. You're walking in his
[1:41:11] presence.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Just like that cucumber sloshing around
[1:41:15] in that juice day after day after day
[1:41:18] after day. and thinking, you know what?
[1:41:20] I don't know if I'm ever going to make
[1:41:22] it. And the whole time you're staying in
[1:41:24] his presence, his presence is changing
[1:41:26] you. You're taking a body change
[1:41:29] already. You don't look like it. You
[1:41:32] don't feel like it. Every time you're in
[1:41:34] his presence, every time you're in his
[1:41:36] presence, he's transforming. [music]
[1:41:38] He's transforming. He's transforming.
[1:41:41] You know, I want I want the real Holy
[1:41:43] Ghost. You know, people say, "I want the
[1:41:44] Holy Ghost." And they'll think because I
[1:41:46] shout or I ran or I spoke in tongues. I
[1:41:48] did all that. Oh, praise God. I got it.
[1:41:50] I really want it. I really want it. And
[1:41:52] they feel like maybe a lot of times they
[1:41:54] feel like they didn't get it.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Don't look for emotions
[1:41:57] like that. Don't look for sensations
[1:41:59] like that. If you get them, praise God.
[1:42:00] I get them, too. Don't ever if God tells
[1:42:03] you to run, run.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Tells you to shout, shout.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; But listen to me, brother and sister.
[1:42:09] The key is stay in [music] his presence.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Because what we need is Pentecost.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And what I mean Pentec Pentecost is not
[1:42:18] organization. Pentecost is an
[1:42:19] experience.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; And brother the prophet said this. We we
[1:42:22] read the Pentecost where the Holy Spirit
[1:42:24] will come back down on top of the
[1:42:25] church.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit will lead [music]
[1:42:29] the individual.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Where he is leading you.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; And you a person can grieve the Holy
[1:42:35] Spirit and the Holy Spirit don't go far.
[1:42:37] He's just right on the branch. He's not
[1:42:39] far. He wants to come back. He wants to
[1:42:42] be in your midst.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Something happened
[1:42:45] and spooked him. You can have a little
[1:42:46] dove there and I can walk. I could do
[1:42:48] that and that's that that devil will fly
[1:42:49] away cuz I spooked it. And there's a lot
[1:42:51] of time people have griefed the Holy
[1:42:53] Spirit away from theirel, away from
[1:42:54] their home, away from their family.
[1:42:58] I'm going here to tell you something. He
[1:42:59] wants to come back.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; That dove of the Holy Spirit wants to
[1:43:03] come right into your home. He wants to
[1:43:05] drop down and he wants to fellowship
[1:43:07] with you lip to ear. Listen to me. He
[1:43:10] wants you. He wants to come back more
[1:43:11] than you want him to come back. But you
[1:43:14] know what? You got to come his way.
[1:43:16] God cannot God well he cannot live in a
[1:43:19] a life of sin. He cannot live in a life
[1:43:21] of filth. He cannot live around a bunch
[1:43:22] of bickering and arguing. God can't live
[1:43:24] around those things. Brothers and
[1:43:25] sister, we shouldn't have those things
[1:43:26] around our home. The devil will try to
[1:43:28] do that to cause havoc around the home.
[1:43:30] What's he doing? Trying to grieve the
[1:43:31] Holy Spirit away. Listen to me. We
[1:43:33] should have that that dynamics of the
[1:43:35] love of God. I'm We need that love more
[1:43:37] than you more than I can ever express in
[1:43:39] my mouth. We need that love in our homes
[1:43:41] and where to where that presence is
[1:43:43] there because you know what that dove
[1:43:45] for many homes he's taking its flight.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; But he wants to come back.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask every head to bow your
[1:43:57] head if you don't mind. Just right where
[1:43:58] you're at, just humble yourself before
[1:44:00] the Lord.
[1:44:03] And I want you to be honest with the
[1:44:04] Lord this morning.
[1:44:07] Don't think about anybody around you.
[1:44:09] No, nothing else matters. All the stuff
[1:44:11] outside, it doesn't matter. Nothing
[1:44:13] matters. The only thing matters right
[1:44:15] here, right now.
[1:44:17] Are you in fellowship with your maker?
[1:44:21] Do you have that dynamics that brother
[1:44:24] Daniel's been talking about this morning
[1:44:25] of that love of God
[1:44:28] or something happened and it's caused it
[1:44:30] to take its flight?
[1:44:32] Humble, but right where you're at. Do
[1:44:34] not look around. Humble yourself before
[1:44:36] the Lord. And I wonder if anybody say,
[1:44:37] "Brother Daniel,
[1:44:39] I don't know what's happened, but that
[1:44:41] love, I feel like it's just moved away,
[1:44:43] but I want it back.
[1:44:45] The Lord sees your hand."
[1:44:48] I believe God honors your honesty.
[1:44:53] I'm here to tell you, God sees the
[1:44:55] hands. God sees your honesty. And I'm
[1:44:57] telling you, he wants to come more than
[1:44:59] you want him to come.
[1:45:03] I'm going to pray with you and if you
[1:45:05] would just pray and if you want to touch
[1:45:07] the person right beside you and let's
[1:45:10] just pray together. Father,
[1:45:14] I humble myself before you this morning.
[1:45:16] Lord,
[1:45:18] Lord, I love you so much, Lord. Lord, I
[1:45:22] thank you for calling me to your word,
[1:45:24] Lord. I thank you for your mercy, Lord.
[1:45:27] Lord, you've seen hands that went up
[1:45:28] across this building, Lord, that said,
[1:45:31] "Father, I didn't mean to do it, Lord."
[1:45:33] But something happened along the way,
[1:45:35] Father. And Lord, I feel like I've just
[1:45:37] I don't have you like I used to have
[1:45:38] you, Lord, but I want you, Lord. I want
[1:45:41] you in my marriage. I want you in my
[1:45:43] home, Lord. Oh, God. I want you in my
[1:45:45] workplace, Lord. Oh, God, I ask you,
[1:45:47] would you walk the aisle, Lord? Every
[1:45:50] hand that's up across the building,
[1:45:51] Lord, would you touch those hands, Lord?
[1:45:54] Oh God, that you would bring such a
[1:45:55] divine love into their hearts, Lord.
[1:45:58] Lord, that you'd go through every door,
[1:46:00] every chamber, Lord. Father, we don't
[1:46:02] want you just for a savior. We want you
[1:46:03] to be the Lord of our life, Lord. Lord,
[1:46:06] Lord of my family, Lord of my Lord, be
[1:46:08] my guide, Lord. Lord, with so many
[1:46:10] people falling to the left and to the
[1:46:12] right, oh God. But Lord, let that not
[1:46:14] happen to me, but ask for me in my
[1:46:16] house, Lord. We want to serve you, Lord.
[1:46:18] Oh God, walk the aisle, Lord. Touch
[1:46:20] hearts, Lord Jesus. Lord, come in in
[1:46:22] your gentle way that you want to come,
[1:46:24] Lord.
[1:46:26] And Lord Jesus, bring a restoration,
[1:46:28] Father. Oh God, we love you today.
[1:46:35] Ask brother Window to come forth. If
[1:46:38] anyone has,
[1:46:40] you do not have to come to the front
[1:46:42] right there where we prayed.
[1:46:45] But if you see, Brother Daniel, I really
[1:46:46] would like the ministry to pray for me.
[1:46:49] We want to open that up to you. If
[1:46:50] anybody would like to come,
[1:46:53] ask brother to come forth.
[1:47:28] to worship
[1:47:38] and for
[1:47:40] the [singing and music] so my soul
[1:47:44] longest is after
[1:47:47] [singing] thee.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; You [singing] alone
[1:47:55] are my heart
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; to worship
[1:48:04] you.
[1:48:08] You [singing]
[1:48:10] alone
[1:48:12] are my strength, [music]
[1:48:14] my shield.
[1:48:17] To you alone, [singing and music]
[1:48:21] my spirit
[1:48:23] heal. [singing]
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; You alone [music]
[1:48:31] are my heart.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. [singing and music]
[1:48:38] to worship
[1:48:40] thee. [music and singing]
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; You're my friend [music]
[1:48:48] and you are
[1:48:50] my brother.
[1:48:53] [music]
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; You [singing] are my king.
[1:49:01] I want [singing]
[1:49:03] you, oh Jesus.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[1:49:12] [singing]
[1:49:13] [music]
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; you [music and singing]
[1:49:19] alone
[1:49:21] are my strength, [music]
[1:49:23] [singing] my shield.
[1:49:26] To you
[1:49:28] alone
[1:49:29] does my [singing] spirit
[1:49:32] yield. [music]
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; You [singing] alone
[1:49:40] are my
[1:49:42] [music]
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; I long to worship
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; as the presence of the Lord is [music]
[1:49:53] here this morning.
[1:50:00] Brother Daniel had made a statement.
[1:50:04] He leads by calling.
[1:50:09] He leads by hunger.
[1:50:13] He gives [music] desire.
[1:50:16] He points it out
[1:50:19] because my sheep know my voice.
[1:50:24] And if the Holy Spirit is [music]
[1:50:26] calling you today,
[1:50:28] he's given you his word and there's
[1:50:30] something there that's saying, "I I long
[1:50:33] for that."
[1:50:35] Right now, let's The festivities can
[1:50:38] wait. We've got all day,
[1:50:41] but right now,
[1:50:44] the master [music] is calling.
[1:50:51] And if he's calling your voice or
[1:50:53] calling your name, you sure don't want
[1:50:55] [music] to push that off.
[1:50:58] And if you want Brother Black to be to
[1:51:00] pray with you,
[1:51:03] I I would say [music] that would be a
[1:51:06] wonderful time. That would be that would
[1:51:08] just be what God is looking in this
[1:51:11] service today
[1:51:14] because a surrendered heart to the Lord,
[1:51:16] a surrender to his will
[1:51:22] is everything.
[1:51:27] And I know for you young people, there's
[1:51:30] [music]
[1:51:30] there's always a lot of things to pull
[1:51:32] you one way or the other. Many many
[1:51:34] times we don't understand the
[1:51:38] we don't understand
[1:51:41] as a young person
[1:51:44] a lot of the anguish and things on the
[1:51:47] inside of us. We [music] we we
[1:51:53] but when you follow when you find Jesus
[1:51:56] and you really [music] really put him
[1:52:00] [clears throat]
[1:52:00] as the shepherd of your life, it's it's
[1:52:03] the greatest thing. Turmoil will still
[1:52:05] be there in all of our lives, but there
[1:52:08] is a peace [music] that comes with a
[1:52:10] surrendered heart to the Lord.
[1:52:13] Elders,
[1:52:15] we need him, too.
[1:52:17] We need him in [music] every stage of
[1:52:18] our lives.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And so, a new commitment to the Lord as
[1:52:22] we sing [music] again.
[1:52:26] Make that commitment to the Lord.
[1:52:28] Whether you come to the front or as I
[1:52:30] see the spirit of the Lord is dealing
[1:52:32] with young and old here today.
[1:52:36] Just make it make this [music] the
[1:52:38] service. Lord, I'm just going to make a
[1:52:40] fresh commitment to you. I I know I've
[1:52:44] got purpose right here. Maybe you're in
[1:52:46] the [music] trial, but I can see that my
[1:52:48] life has purpose. No matter where you
[1:52:51] are, God is with you. He's leading you.
[1:52:55] Father, we want to look to you here this
[1:52:57] morning.
[1:52:59] Oh God, we give ourselves to you today,
[1:53:04] Lord Jesus. We want you to be pleased.
[1:53:09] And as the man of God was ministering
[1:53:11] this [music] morning,
[1:53:13] Lord, we could hear your voice. We could
[1:53:15] hear we could hear purpose.
[1:53:19] Father, we don't want to just be here
[1:53:22] just to be here. But Lord, knowing that
[1:53:26] you've got a divine call and
[1:53:30] we must surrender or surround ourselves
[1:53:32] with your presence
[1:53:35] or we become stickery and prickly and
[1:53:39] but oh God, we want to be ooze and Lord
[1:53:43] Lord we want that pickle solution to be
[1:53:48] through and through Lord
[1:53:51] Father to where we become exactly what
[1:53:54] your purpose is for us.
[1:53:56] Take every sin, take all lukewarmness,
[1:53:59] take everything out of our hearts that's
[1:54:00] not pleasing to you. Father,
[1:54:04] we need you today and we love you, Lord,
[1:54:06] with all of our heart.
[1:54:09] We're giving ourselves, we're opening
[1:54:11] ourselves to you, Lord, because we want
[1:54:13] to be pregnant with you by your spirit,
[1:54:17] by your word.
[1:54:19] We thank you [music] for it, Father.
[1:54:22] Oh God, we love you.
[1:54:26] Oh Jesus, we love you. Father,
[1:54:32] we thank you for it. Lord,
[1:54:36] you
[1:54:37] alone are my heart's
[1:54:42] desire and [singing] I long
[1:54:45] to worship
[1:54:48] you.
[1:54:51] To be [singing] like Jesus.
[1:54:56] [music]
[1:54:59] to be like Jesus. [music]
[1:55:08] On earth I long
[1:55:15] to be
[1:55:17] like him [singing]
[1:55:22] all through
[1:55:25] life's journey. [singing]
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. From
[1:55:31] earth
[1:55:32] to glory,
[1:55:38] I only
[1:55:40] ask
[1:55:45] to be. [music and singing]
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Could we take it up a couple of keys?
[1:55:52] To be [singing and music]
[1:55:54] like Jesus.
[1:56:00] to [singing] be
[1:56:02] like [music]
[1:56:03] Jesus.

[1:56:24] life's journey [singing]
[1:56:29] from earth to glory.

[1:56:36] I only
[1:56:39] ask
[1:56:43] to [singing]
[1:56:44] be
[1:56:46] like one more time.
[1:56:48] Oh, make the commitment to be like
[1:56:53] [singing] Jesus.
[1:56:56] Hallelujah.
[1:56:58] To be like,

[1:59:49] you
[1:59:50] praise.
[1:59:55] All I [singing]
[1:59:56] [music]
[1:59:57] adore
[2:00:00] is in you [singing]
[2:00:03] [music]
[2:00:06] all together now.
[2:00:10] Lord, I give you
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; give you my [singing] heart.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Give you my soul.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Give you my soul.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; I [music] live [singing] for you.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Every breath [singing] that I take,
[2:00:29] every moment I'm away,
[2:00:35] Lord, have [singing] your [music] way
[2:00:39] in me.
[2:00:42] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:44] Praise the Lord. [music] I love him here
[2:00:46] this morning.
[2:00:49] I appreciate the word of the Lord.
[2:00:52] God's always right on time. [music]
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; His words are just they he just never
[2:00:58] ceases to amaze me how the Lord knows
[2:01:01] exactly where we are and what we have
[2:01:04] need of.
[2:01:06] And I was thinking the other day or as
[2:01:08] he was talking about sometimes the Lord
[2:01:10] uses you when you're feeling like you're
[2:01:12] the most unspiritual. [music]
[2:01:16] And um
[2:01:18] I I gave the testimony here the other
[2:01:20] day how that Katrina [music]
[2:01:22] had had text me with a scripture and
[2:01:24] said that she had had me on her heart
[2:01:27] during the night and prayed [music] and
[2:01:30] sent me that little scripture. And she
[2:01:32] says, "Now it makes you you're making
[2:01:34] that sound like I was really spiritual."
[2:01:36] [music]
[2:01:37] And uh she said I was having nightmares
[2:01:41] [music] and I was it was it was not a
[2:01:43] good night for me
[2:01:45] and I just started praying for people
[2:01:47] and you come across my heart while I was
[2:01:49] praying [music] and
[2:01:53] she said but I was nowhere spiritual. I
[2:01:55] didn't feel a [music] thing.
[2:01:59] And uh and I told her, I said, "But the
[2:02:02] thing is,
[2:02:04] the Lord gave me my healing."
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; I I was I was laying in bed hurting.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I had been hurting for weeks,
[2:02:16] hurting,
[2:02:19] and the Lord healed my tailbone. [music]
[2:02:23] And there she was the most unspiritual.
[2:02:27] She says, [laughter]
[2:02:30] "Amen." [music] And she was praying for
[2:02:32] me to get her mind off of the nightmare
[2:02:35] she was having. And here the Lord and
[2:02:37] the and and and the Lord used it to
[2:02:42] minister to me. Isn't that amazing?
[2:02:46] Because God sometimes when we're in our
[2:02:49] situations, maybe if she would have
[2:02:51] sleeping good, I wouldn't have came
[2:02:52] across her mind. Hallelujah. But I came
[2:02:55] across her mind and she prayed [music]
[2:02:57] and God used her as the agent for me.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it works, but all I
[2:03:02] know is it works.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; All I know is I was the guy in all of
[2:03:07] the pain [music] and then why he didn't
[2:03:10] touch the rest of my back. I don't know
[2:03:11] that neither. But I do know that when he
[2:03:14] does things, he he he's God.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. [music]
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:20] And I just say thank God to know how the
[2:03:22] reality of his promises and [music] the
[2:03:26] blessings of his promises.
[2:03:29] Amen. So we appreciated the word of the
[2:03:31] Lord here today. [music]
[2:03:33] Amen. Yes. Give the Lord a hand clap.
