protected there no place I'd rather be praise the Lord praise the Lord [Music] praise the lord well it's always interesting with these kind of services I was talking with brother Wendell just for a minute about it earlier I always love to see how the Lord works it out to connect things um so we'll see how the Lord works it out this time as well uh um I'm going to pick on my Sunday school class for just a moment boys do you remember what we taught on this morning well good then this will be fresh um so we're just going to be continuing off of what I worked on what I did with Sunday school um brother Wendell to talked to me this morning saying we were going to be doing this and I was thinking a few different directions but I kept kind of going back to what I had talked about in Sunday school and so that's where we're going to kind of build off of so um we can go to 1st Samuel chapter [Music] 7 1 Samuel chapter 7 and we're just going to read verses 1 and two and the men of kirath jiram came and fetched up the Ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and Sanctified elazar his son to keep the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass while the ark Abode in kirath jiram that the time was long for it was 20 years and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord if you all have your seats this takes place after the Philistines had captured the Ark of the Covenant uh Israel had gone out to war um and the sons of Eli had taken the Ark of the Covenant out with them and they perished the Ark of the Covenant was captured and the Philistines took it and God Afflicted them for having his Arc of the Covenant and so they placed it on a cart pulled by two oxen um two mothers who the babies had been separated from them and The Oxen went straight back to Israel and they came to this place and so the Arc of the Covenant had returned to Israel but it was still in kind of this far off area it wasn't back to the center of the kingdom it wasn't back to uh where it should be where it was easy access for all it wasn't back in uh even the tent where it was supposed to be it wasn't in the tent that they had traveled with they didn't have a Temple for it to go to yet and so instead it was placed of in the home of abinadab and it was in this home for 20 years and so abinadab and the people there they Sanctified one of his sons to to keep the Ark of the Lord but this was not a family of Levites this was not a family of uh those that were supposed to be taking care of the ark or those that were supposed to be watching over it it was somebody that was willing to take it into their home um and we know the story that goes on from there but I just want to think about this for a few moments that here the Arc of the Covenant is in this person's in this person's home and like I said this isn't a levite this isn't somebody who has spent all his life studying the laws of Moses this isn't a person who has spent year after year making sure that they know the way they're supposed to handle everything and so there was no way for his sons to be taught the exact way that they should be handling this they weren't they didn't have that in front of them and so when it comes time for you know 20 20 years passed this with the Ark of the Covenant there and it's something that they uh respect it's something obviously that they care for and that they were willing to bring it into their home but yet at the same time 20 years of this sitting there and it began to be the normal thing you would wake every day and here's the ark there's you know if we think about the way that God had set aside the ark to be handled it was only to be handled by the priests it was obviously getting ahead of the story but it was only to be transported by the priests and when it wasn't being transported it was within the holy of holies it wasn't something that just anyone could come and lay eyes on it wasn't just something that anyone could approach it there was a reverence about it that only certain ones could come only certain ones could come into the presence of the Lord only certain ones were able to come in you know only the high priest could come in and have a little bit of the Mana that was still saved within it and and all these different things but in this home it was just there there's nothing in here saying that they built a special room or special place for it there's nothing saying that they they they covered it or they did this or that or the other they were trying to take take care of it they were doing what they could but yet at the same time it was something that over the course of 20 years became very common to them it became something that it's just there you know it's just it's just sitting up on the shelf and we walk by it every day and we take it up and dust it off a little bit on Sunday when we go to church and then it goes back on the shelf and you know I think probably most of us would say that we have multiple copies of the Bible in our house especially any of us that are married or have children probably every single person has their own copy and I don't know about most of you but I probably have all of my old bibles are stored on a shelf I have we have so many copies that there when it comes to message books we have shelves of of message books I have new copies I have old ones that were from my dad that the old compilations and these big brown hardback editions I've got these on my shelf I've got all these different things where we walk by them every day and they can start to be common to us they can start to be be something that while we still respect it you know in no way am I taking my Bible and throwing it on the ground or or rolling it in the dirt or dropping in the mud or doing anything like that we're treating it with some level of respect but the commonness begins to break down the reverence that should be there what's become so common begins to push aside the reverence that's what God that what God demands of us as we go into to 2 Samuel we find that that David has the desire to bring the Ark of the Covenant back into the center of Israel he wants to bring it to the capital so that it you know in his mind going the entire country will be blessed it's going to be more centrally located it's going to be better for the people to come worship it's going to be more of a blessing to all it needs to be here and we all know we've read this so many times that you know he comes in with the the best intentions he his desire is good wanting to bring the Ark in and so they come in and they come in with the new cart and they load it and two of abinadab sons are the ones that are driving the cart two of these Sons that for the past 20 years have walked by this every day this is where I'm going back to if you think about it this was supposed to be something so holy so special that for most people in Israel if they sought it a couple of times in their life it was going to be a lot especially once they were no longer traveling in the wilderness and so it was just staying in the tent all the time it was supposed to stay in the holy of holies it was only supposed to be seen when they took it out to carry it as they traveled other than that it was a place for the priest for the high priest to go and yet these two that had been around it so much that had walked by it day by day that hadn't been schooled on all the laws and all the guidelines and everything that they were supposed to be following once again they weren't disrespecting The Ark in any way they weren't there's nothing in the scripture that says they were out worshiping false gods or false Idols or doing anything they believed God but yet the Ark of the Covenant was something that though they respected though they cared for some of the reverence had been lost and we go through and all of us have have read this they're going along and the cart jostles and Aza reaches out to keep the ark from falling once again the best of intentions he wasn't in his mind going I want to desecrate the ark I want to do this I want to do that he's going he's thinking I don't want this to fall in the dirt but yet even that led to the fact that the reverence wasn't there that went this is something I can't touch this is too holy Lord I don't want it to fall in the mud but I cannot touch this this is only for the priest this is only for those that have been set apart and Aza reaches out to St to stabilize the ark to keep it from falling and God slays him and in a lot of ways we'll look at this story and even as Christians we'll look at it and go Lord weren't you being just a little too harsh he wasn't he just was trying to keep your from falling in the dirt that's all he was doing was he was trying to keep it from falling in the dirt but yet all too often we can allow the things around us and our relationship with God to become common and once again it's not because we are wanting to walk away from what we believe we're not walking away from Christianity we're not walking away from the message we're not turning our back on any of them but it's become especially here in the United States it's become so easy I as I talked about before I have multiple Bibles on the shelves at home for either myself or my wife or my children I have message books in multiple places on multiple shelves in multiple boxes my phone has the Bible app it has the table so I can have the message I have it on my computer I we have it on our iPads we have it on it's everywhere I can get it any time that I want I can be sitting anywhere I could be sitting in the dentist office waiting room I could be sitting at the DMV waiting to get in I could be here there anywhere and I have access because in all those places I have my phone but yet if I want to actually think about the percentage of time that as I'm sitting somewhere I pull out my phone and I pull up the Bible or the table I am probably going to be embarrassed in fact I can guarantee if I take the time to truly map it out I'm going to be embarrassed I don't even have to think about it that long to go I don't do it that much in my home those message books that are on the shelves how often are they actually getting pulled off to be read how often are they actually getting handled those Bibles that are on the shelves even the one that's my personal I use this is the one that I use how often am I grabbing this when I want to take time to read for a moment or when I want to take a moment of quietness how often is that what I'm reaching for versus whatever interesting novel happens to be holding my attention or whatever self-help book or whatever topic I might be interested in learning about I remember I've heard the different brothers and sisters and I remember my own dad talking about when the message was first coming out and they would get a tape and they would be passed around the church they would gather together to listen to it because a new tape just came out we just got a little more of the prophet's word and they would listen to it over and over and over alone in groups everything because there was a preciousness to it it was something that they it wasn't just that they respected the message it wasn't just that they thought good of it but there was a preciousness there was a desire that I have to have more they held it up to a it'd be like they received that in the mail and they're getting all excited great I've got the next tape my oldest son got signed up this last year he's had this program where he's been getting boxes mailed to him that are different robots he can build and he's learning about different things with with engineering and circuitry and stuff and he gets so excited I just got the notification my box shipped it's about to be here and then it arrived lives and the first thing he wants to do is put everything together and it's great I love watching it but when was the last time one of us looked at a message that way when was the last time one of us looked at our Bible that way that it was almost as good as you know people would use the term opening up a it's almost as good as opening up a Christmas gift or opening up a birthday gift I'm coming in and there's something special here we go through all these times when we're going and we're reading our daily devotions and we're doing it on and we have this built into our routine we're like yes we're supposed to be into the word every single day we're supposed to be at church on Sundays and Wednesdays we're supposed to be at youth bible study on Tuesday nights we're supposed to be this that the other and yet it can start to become so common once again not that we're disrespecting it not that we're thinking badly but that we begin to lose a little bit of the reverence that we're supposed to have it begins to be something that we take for granted a little bit too much all of us that are married couples we maybe I'm only talking to myself husbands we can fall into that same trap with our wives where we start to to look at them and it's my wife I love her I'm always glad to go home to her but I don't write her quite as many notes as I used to or I don't write her as many letters as I used to or I don't run by the store and pick up her favorite chocolate bar quite as often as I used to or I don't do this or I don't do that whatever it was that was in your relationship is these were the things that where you were setting apart going she is that important I'm going to make sure to do these and wives I'm sure that you have some of those same things you can think of towards your husband the maybe there was a favorite dessert of his that you used to make sure okay I'm going to I've got to make sure to make this for him and get it for him and now it's just look there's food on the table that's enough particularly all the particularly all the wives that have children it's like the children are alive and there's food on the table so there any more you want it's here we can get so busy we can get so focused on doing the different things going to work providing rubbing shoulders with the world dealing with this dealing with that and it's not that I am going man I wish I had a different wife I wish I had someone else it's nothing going into that but it begins to hit this commonness of I know she's going to be there when I go home I know she's going to be there when I wake up to leave great and we run into the same thing with our relationship with God it begins to be common it begins to be something easy you see the same thing as in Samuel as when he becomes old and the Elders of Israel come to him and say we want a king your sons aren't serving God the way that they should so give us a king now they spoke the truth Samuel's children were not serving the lord they were not doing what they were supposed to do Samuel had appointed them judges and they were being dishonest they were doing different things they shouldn't so when the elders spoke and said that there was truth there but the next step they took to go we want a king we want to be like the other nations around us was the the point that you see that God had become common to them and they Samuel spoke back and he was angry he like why why would you be doing this and the elders spoke to him and said we're not rejecting God we're not turning away from him we're not we're not going to serve Idols we just want to have someone we can look to that will lead us into battle and will do all these things it logic ically sounded good logically it made sense but yet it demonstrated that their relationship with God and even their relationship to the prophet had become common it was no longer something that they had the reverence for it was no longer something that they held to a high esteem because they were now looking going no that's better this is not as value as much Samson didn't hold the anointing and his Nazarite vow with much esteem he did his different things and the Philistines were punished as he was going through but he was more focused on on his own enjoyment and his own pleasure he wasn't worried about following all the Old Testament laws that he was supposed to he wasn't worried about doing all the right things he wasn't turning his back on God per se but he also wasn't holding it up as this Nazarite vow is something special this Nazarite vow is something that I should hold on to it became common to him he knew that when he woke up he would be strong he knew that when danger came the spirit would come on him and he would be able to overcome he knew that no matter what challenge he faced the spirit would be there and he would be fine and it became something that was so normal and so common to him that it no longer held a value until he was willing to tell Delilah and sell out his secret it had become common to him in the door inside the door brother brandom says you say Lord I've watched it but tonight maybe it's been too common for me maybe tonight Lord if you'll just open my eyes of understanding and anoint my eyes with spiritual sight let me Lord see your presence tonight and know and understand that I'm living just before the world meets its end Psalms chapter 1 starting at verse one says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now the scripture doesn't say [Music] that his knowledge in the law of the Lord is so great it doesn't even say that his understanding of the law of the Lord is so great but it says his Delight his desire his his wants his his goals his focus is on the law of the Lord his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night it's something he spends time thinking about it's something he spends time looking at it's something that he puts a lot of time and attention into because it's of value it's of importance to him it's not something that he holds to be common but he holds it to be something that is precious in Numbers chapter 25 you find one of the children of Israel bringing a midianite midan itish woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation into their tent this Israelite doesn't care that what Moses has said what God has said he's found this woman that's what he wants and the scriptures tell us that Phineas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it and he rose up from among the congregation and he took a javelin in his hand and he went in and slew them and God speaks to Moses after this and he says Phineas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold I give unto him my Covenant of peace and he shall have it and his seed after him even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israel Phineas looked at it and this was not something that was common this was not something that wasn't important it was something that he was going to to be zealous for if God had said this then this was what had to be done you know we look at the three Hebrew children with Nebuchadnezzar they came up and they wouldn't bow down to the image and Nebuchadnezzar brings them up before him and he says bow or you're going into the fiery furnace and these three are not prophets Daniel is not standing beside them they're friends with Daniel they are friends with the prophet but they are not prophets scriptures say nothing about them having the gift of being a prophet they're standing there and they're having this threat and they say King we know our God can we know he is able we know he can save us but whether he does or whether he doesn't we are not bowing down their relationship with God was important enough was precious enough that they were willing to die for it they were willing to die a very gruesome death for it this was not if God hadn't stepped in this was not an easy death they were about to go into this was going to be painful until the end but yet they were willing to stand there and go this is more important than my life this is more important than my wants or my desires this is that precious there's nothing common about this this is that important to me in Isaiah I'm sorry in 2 Chronicles we find King Uzziah and King Uzziah as he's is a Godly King and he's doing all the right things but he begins to get lifted up thinking himself to be something more important than just a king that God's blessing and he comes up and he feels like he should be able to go in and offer incense and he should be able to take a priest's place and he goes to the point where he is wroth with the the Levites and the priests that are trying to correct him and so God strikes him with Leprosy and he's a leper until the day he dies it had become common to him because he began to think of himself as more important than what God had placed him but then we step into the book of Isaiah Isaiah chapter 6 and verse one it says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of host the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me brother brandham talks about this verse and he talks about the seraphim and one thing that he makes sure to point out is they had wings over their faces they had to be in reverence at all times this is what they were called to do this is the place they were called to be but yet they weren't allowed to just look upon it just to look upon the glory of God they had to have wings over their faces covering because they had to be reverent through it all Isaiah has come to the temple and he's torn up and he's upset because he cared for Uzziah and now Uzziah has died and the first thing that God shows him is these beings that are made to be in his presence and they're made to have this reverence from the very beginning and for the whole time they're there they have to maintain this reverence because this isn't a position that they can begin to think of as oh yeah this is just normal I go to work every day yeah I work in the presence of God that's what I do it's all yep yeah just clocking in and going before God that's that's normal but they had to maintain that reverence and Isaiah is sitting there and he's going I'm not worthy of this it wasn't common to him he wasn't sitting there going that's right God you need to come down and talk to me and explain to me what happened to Uzziah he wasn't sitting there thinking that he was anything more than what he was he was sitting there and he was going God I am a man of unclean lips I do not deserve this and yet with that humility God was willing to come down and touch him with the coal of the Altar and then Isaiah could stand and go send me I'll go it's so easy for us to fall into this mindset of things being common because we get busy with life we get busy with work we get busy with the kids we get busy with this that and the other thing and like I said earlier we live in probably the country in the world where we have the easiest time to get this not only because of the freedoms we have but because brother Brandon was here in this country he spoke our language there's no translation needed other than you got to understand Kentucky English but you know we don't have to do a whole lot of translating we don't have to put it into a different language it's in our language it's here for us and yet because of how easy it is it becomes something that we don't hold quite as precious we need to be asking for God to take us back to the mindset that some of these Elders here had had when that tape would show up in the mail or that new book would come in and it was something so important so precious when we hear Brother Wendell talk about when he got the adoption series and listen to it and is weeping as he's listening to it because it's something that showing the value and he's realizing how important and how precious it is it wasn't something common it wasn't something he listened to it once tossed it aside and went on about his day I have a feeling he wore that tape out that is where we're supposed to be at even though it's now easy access even though we can now find the message on our phones we can have the Bible on our phones we can have all these copies and everything when we go to open up the word when we go to open up a message book this shouldn't be something that we take lightly this shouldn't be something that we enter into as common this isn't something we should enter into as the normal everyday type thing but this be something we should be going into and I'm preaching it myself here I'm not trying to say I'm above yall and I've achieved this but every time I'm opening up this Bible I should be going in going this is from God he spoke this through man and wrote it down and then left it here for me this is in all intents and purposes this may have as well have been God picking up the pen himself and writing every single word and that's the value I should be taking every time I open this every time I open up my Bible and I go in to read a verse let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you you this is God speaking this to us this is our husband writing to us going I prepared a place for you I have a home for you I have a place that you're going to that I'm calling you to this isn't just a book sitting on the shelf this isn't just the latest novel that's come out or the latest magazine or the latest whatever this is the word of God given to his children to his bride saying I love you and I want you to talk to me I want to have a relationship with you this is a God that wants to come down and every time we Kneel To Pray we're getting to speak directly to him these there things that become so common to us become so common to me and yet there are things that we should be holding and having so much reverence towards because it's a God that was willing to come down to man in order to bring man up to him Lord bless you [Music] amen you love him here this evening how many enjoyed that from Brother Harry always uh listen to brother Harry preach and I'm just like wow wish I could be put together like that you know and yeah but um if we could here just for a few moments I'd like to look into a few passages of scripture uh just familiar passages uh just listening to brother wendle when he was preaching this morning and he ended on the story of Gideon and in the Book of Judges and it's always been a real favorite book of mine always enjoyed learning and hearing about the judges that of Israel but um you know here in the in the uh 13th chapter starting in the third verse I'm read a few verses here and then we could be seated but if you're there just say Amen but in the Scriptures it says here third verse3 chapter in The Book of Judges it says and the angel of the Lord appeared unto a woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and bearest not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo thou Hast conceived and and bear a son and no razor shall come upon his head for the child to be a Nazarite unto God from from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of God came unto me and his countenance was like a countenance of an angel of God very terrible but I asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name but he said unto me behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb until the day of his death amen let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we just love you here this evening Lord and we thank you for the word from Brother Harry Lord we just ask that we just apply those Lord these things to our life Lord my lot Lord I would just ask that you would just be able to get some of these words out Lord some of the things Lord I've been just listening father and just some of the things you've just been speaking to my heart and I just pray Lord that we could be a blessing to the congregation here Lord we thank you for just being with us here this evening in Jesus name amen you could be seated here this evening and um you know when you're sitting down there and you're looking up here you're thinking man it's you know it it's easy to get up in front of some people but my Palms are sweating you know and got this weird Palm YY feeling in my in my hands and I promise you I've been washing my hands you know and um you know and I just wanted to say I appreciate all the brothers that come out and help save my house and my neighbor's house and and uh you know it uh you know you know besides you know getting to eat afterwards you know uh you know I I feel like we were just an incredible witness to Mike uh my neighbor brother uh you know he he was just all struck you know that we he was like all these people come to your church and I was like yeah he's like what are they doing here and I'm just like well they're here to put out the fire you know and he's like well I don't even know you guys and I'm just like well just how it is you know and just you know we're all just kind of you know band together kind of thing and he was just he was just flored you know uh you know the compassion and you know and um and he just expressed to me you know lot several times afterwards about how that he was just just floored by everybody in the pray and the things that you know for uh for Mike you know and we just pray that the Lord would use that moment and plant a seed in his life and and U you know and bring him on in and and um so again we just appreciate that and you know I I've always loved the story of Samson and it it's been just kind of a staple in in my life and you know you know before I'd ever heard about you know the Avengers or Power Rangers and things like that the the men the the people in in judges those were my heroes you know you you know I'd always thought of you know Samson and jeffa and you know some of the different ones and the where the spirit of the Lord had come upon these men and and God God was using these men during this course of time I believe it was in the in between time where there was no prophets and and he would be he would use these men to deliver Israel because Israel as you know as anybody that reads the Bible knows they just had a way of going in a cycle of things and and you know getting into sin and God with delivering and getting into sin and God would deliver him and kind of like what brother wendle was talking about going stop going around the mountain you know it's time to go northward you know and and I was just beginning to uh think about this and I had been listening there and um oh Lord once more uh there brother Brandon preaches there in 63 and and uh you know and I was thinking about this and and you know there in uh some of the Bible here and you can read on down through some of Samson's life and and how that you know if I could maybe just kind of parallel some of the things that Samson's life is with the believer you know and and we can all can kind of come to these sort of situations that Samson go through maybe we can relate to some of these things and you know and and I began to look at some of the things that Samson did you know the the scripture that we had just read you know the angel did come to did come to Samson's mom and was like you know you know don't put a razor to his head and he had also given her instructions to not you know drink wine or to have you know me different things you know meat that was unclean and and things and the reason was was because Samson was going to be set apart Samson was chosen Samson was was before his before he was even born he was just conceived into the womb but yet God had already thought of Samson God had already thought that you know what this is the individual that I'm going to raise up and and I'm going to destroy the Philistines through Samson's life and and we know that through these things you know that through Samson's life that you know that he was a strong man you know and and we through our lives you know we we were selected of God whether we like to believe it or not but the very reason you're here is not just because your mom brought you or not because your dad brought you or not just because you know it's just you drove by one day and you seen this building and you real like oh I should go there to church you know because because that that's just not the case but there's a deep that's calling to the Deep there's something that there's something that God was speaking out to us and that but there's something in you to respond and there's a lot of times where people will hear this message but there's not nothing to reciprocate there's not something where where they listen to it and and and they're like wow you know that you know uh you know wow that really spoke to my heart they're like well who's this Kentucky man or who's this or who's that but they never really grasps the Revelation that that this is the word for the hour and you know and I begin to think about this about how that Samson he was selected of God and he and and and his mother and his father did everything you know you read on down in the story he did everything or they did everything you know that the angel told him to do everything that there was in their instructions you know and and Samson begin to grow up and he was just a young he was just a young man and and he was actually he was he was going for a walk and he was going to you know he was he was going for a walk and and a lion come into his way and and he and the spirit or the scripture says that the spirit of the Lord come upon Samson and and he and he and he had got this strength and he slew this lion and and that on his way back from his journey that he had noticed that the lion that he had slew that it had it had honey growing in it or honey had come and bees had come you know and they had they had and they had made you know uh uh honey inside of him and and he took the honey to his father and his mother and they ate and he didn't tell them the story really about what happened and and I began to think about you know the second time where uh uh you know that that Samson had had been used of the Lord to where you know he he took foxes and and and you know him and the Philistines right about that period of time they had really started kind of going at it after each other you know before the foxes he he tied them together the scripture says that he used the the the that everybody knows the story about how that he was going to get married and and he was the Philistine woman and the the different changes of clothes and the different things but yet the the uh the scripture says that the Lord used that occasion to bring op between them uh for Samson and the Philistines and and we could see where Samson you know he got angry because of the Riddle That his wife had sold him out basically it's just what it was she sold him out you know sold him out and told them the answer to the riddle and and and and again he he was able to catch 300 foxes now I I I'm lucky to shoot one deer you know or you know just one deer a day but this man caught 300 foxes all at one time you know and not only just caught these foxes but he tied their tails together and set them on fire you know and they they're running and then you know they're running all across the they're running all across the you know all all over the Plains and they're setting oil olive fields on fire wheat fields on fire you know and and then they then they sought occasion against Samson and Samson you know he he goes up on a hill and and all the Philistines they begin to surround Samson you know and and they're going to you know and but I believe it was Judah you know they they come up the Philistines come up to Judah and they were like hey you know we need you to go up there and get Samson off the mountain we need you to go up there so Judah walks up there and they're like hey you can't be doing this don't you know that the don't you know that the Philistines are Lord over us and that's something that caught my eye that You' got God's chosen people sitting there recognizing that that they are Lord over their enemies and I begin to think about that but that was Samson's entire purpose was to be there to deliver Israel from from the Philistines and you know and Judah walks up or uh yeah was Judah Judah walks up there and they're like hey you're going to have to come down over here so you know we can we're going to have to deliver you up and Samson's like well I'll go ahead and do it but but you got a promise that you're not going to put your sword against me either you know and and they're like okay we'll promise you know and so they they said now when we can do this we're going to bind you hand and foot when you go and he's like all right that's fine but you know I know the I know the rest of the story Samson was setting up the Philistines you know and then and then all of a sudden Samson you know he gets bound hand and foot and he arrives over there with the Philistines and the scripture says that the spirit of the Lord comes upon Samson and Samson gets out there and he just breaks he breaks the bands off of his hands and he breaks his bands off of his feet and the only thing that he had around him was just an old jaw bone well actually the you know the scripture said a new Jawbone if I got it right some you know something like that and he said that there was just a Jawbone that was standing there and or not standing you know it was just laying there and and the and the Jawbone was there and and he grabs this Jawbone and he just begins to just start smiting Philistines he just jumps right in the middle of them the scripture says the spirit of the Lord comes upon Samson and he just starts smiting Philistines and and he whips them all the way around and and and the Philistines end up leaving and and I begin to think about how that when Samson you know when he begin to get tired after that you know and he you know he sits down and he just thinking you know Lord I I've done this work and I I've done this you know I've smed all these Philistines but yeah I'm going to die of thirst I'm and I don't blame the man you know the man was working you know I mean he had a jaw bone and you're whipping a thousand Philistines you're going to be a little tired you know and and and the scripture says that God reached down and enclaved a hollow a hollow spot in the Jawbone of that donkey and and Prov divided water out out of the Jawbone so that so that Samson could drink you know and I begin to think about I begin to think about some of these things and about how that you know a lot of times in our Christian walk you know God gives us you know experiences in our lives he gives us you know uh just miraculous things you know and and how that how that you know those times are precious and and we should really keep those things and I love how brother Harry brought out you know we take things common and and we take things to where we for graned you know and just you know we can look in our lives and I begin to look out across the church you know and think about some of the things that we go through and y'all just you just bear with me for a minute but I'm just going to just going to talk you know and and I begin to think about how that there's a lot of things in in in our lives and I've seen a lot of miracles in our church and I've seen a lot of things where God has raised up and he's and he's destroyed devils and he's and he's mastered circumstances you know and for some reason I was listening to the message oh Lord once more and I begin to think about the time when when um you know Sister Katrina you know I'm sorry for putting you on the spot you know but I begin to think about the time when she had a problem with her rotator cup and in in her shoulder and and nobody knew about it because really Katrina doesn't say anything or she don't say much about you know her problems you know she just leaves it and she just prays to the Lord and and I had heard through the Great Vine you know okay we're just a small Church you know so you know I just heard through the grap Vine about how that you know uh uh how that her she had her shoulders it was hurt and I began to watch because we was at the old church you know and I was sitting in the back there and you know you could see everybody you know you could see everybody and what they're doing and all that kind of thing and and and I noticed that Katrina was Raising both arms and and she was praying to the Lord and she was just worship worshiping and and I was I begin to think I was like you know I thought her shoulder was hurt you know and I I begin to think about and I begin to I begin to you know just just think about these things in my mind and she got up and she had told the Lord she had gave a testimony about how that she told the Lord that if you would just if you would just give me the ability to to lift my hands and and and to praise God that Lord I raise them for you and and I begin to see there where where Satan Was Defeated you know and I begin to look back in in in you know some of our church history or where brother mural you know he had have that uh hyper thyroid problem you know and he just began to dwindle away and you know he thought it was a great thing there for a little while he called it his diet plan you know and he just he just eat everything that he wanted you know but yet he just begin to dwindle away and and you know I was there in PKA City when we were selling selling shoes you know the the sports there they were the hit you know the sports Air shoes you and we were there in Ponka City and and we you know sister Leah had called and she said you know she said you're going to have to come and help Merl he just come into the floor and he collapsed and and I remember us all backing up and I remember it's all heading towards towards Iola and it was a pretty good distance and when we got there you know brother murl he was just laying on the floor and we' prayed and and he had had his medicine you know sister Leah you know you better take your medicine and this that and the other and and he just stood on faith and he just believed that the Lord would heal would heal him because you know that's just what scripture says and and and and he took those things and you know and and God healed him of that hyperthyroidism and I began to think about the time where you know sister fres I remember that when she would had her high blood pressure and and you know her her she would just get you know kind of uh I called it loopy but it's not loopy but you know she would you know her like she would you know the pressure was just there in her head you know and she would and she would just get so bothered by it and and I remember there in New Mexico where where that you know she was there and she was prayed for and you know sister fres when when she believes something the next thing you know brother window's chasing her down and she throws all her medicine in the toilet you know and and she flushes it there in the toilet and and and you know the the Lord and the Lord healed her of that you know and the Lord Lord healed her of those things and there's some other stories you know that I'm sure crossed my mind but I remember you know just me and my personal life I remember you know I was telling somebody uh at at a table one time about how the Lord had had uh you know uh brought me out of my situation you know just as a young man and and the Lord had moved upon moved upon the church to to uh have prayer meetings and to have uh you know go and pray at the church and I really don't I was just real young you know I was just real little you know maybe I was probably you know Michaela's age and maybe a little younger or something like that but all the church was getting together and we had prayed that that the Lord would um you know uh come through for my mom's situation and that we would be able to you know that we could have she could have all of her kids and she can and and as at a young age I remember you know I was supposed to be praying but I wasn't you know and I just running around and and I would just be listening to people praying you know and getting next to them and hearing them and and ask and hearing them calling out to God and asking you know Lord that you would that you would intervene that you know with the judge and how that Lord that you would put in his heart to see that that God's doing something here and and I would just remember and and you know as a young kid you listen to these things but when but but when bosow showed up that day and and he dropped all of the he dropped all the luggage off at the door and he said here you can have them I I realized that that God was real and I realized at a young age that God was doing something and and that God wouldn't just put me in the situations in my life to where I could see these things happening and and I begin to feel God moving upon my heart but and and you know and I begin to think about how Samson he had gone through a lot of these situations in his life and he had gone he had seen the he he had real high Highs but he also had real low lows you know and I began to think about how that you know that that Samson you know he he he began to get a little cocky you know and and Samson began to get a little bit you know built up in himself and one day he met his match when he came to a Delila you know and he and then when he came to this Delilah you know that she was a trap for Samson and and Satan knows exactly where to come and he knows exactly where to penetrate whether it's through whether it's it might be video games it might be you know porn it might be music it might be drugs and alcohol or you know what whatever ever it is take your Vice you know it might be something in your life where God or where Satan's going to put his Delilah because we know that Satan's got one shot he's got one punch coming towards every one of our lives and I begin to think about how that Delila the scripture says that she pressed him daily and that how that every day in our life that Satan presses us daily in the things that we struggle in that he presses Us in music and he he presses Us in movies and he presses Us in games and entertainment and he presses because what he's searching for is your strength and he's what he's searching for is is what is it that makes you tick what is it that that gives you the ability to keep going further with God when when when you're stumbling here and you're fighting here and and and and and and you're just seems like you get you're going to give up but yet you still have the strength to move on and and you listen to what Delilah says and she says you know Samson what is it that's the secret of your strength and and the problem was was like our brother said that that God became common to Samson God became God became uh just just another person just someone that you you just shake your hand and you walk on but yet he didn't realize that the spirit that was on him was gifted to him by God and God Alone he begin to get cocky and he begin to lay in the lap the lap of Delilah and he begin to say oh if you just get new cords and you bind me that'll be the secret to my strength and he bust out of them when when when Delilah come out was like oh Samson the Philistines are on you you know that Samson would bust out of the new cords and he would get away you know but then the second time it was like he was like oh if you just take my hair and you braid it you know and and you put it in this certain way you know it it'll take my strength and so she would wait until he falls asleep because he's just hanging out with sin he's just hanging out with the world he's just hanging out with the things that he's not supposed to be doing and then sometimes I wonder if he was conscious of even what was going on he was just going through his everyday desires and whatever he W whatever he wanted but yet Delilah would say Samson the Philistines are on you the Philistines are are coming and and he would jump out the window or he would fight the Philistines you know and and after reading it a couple of times I was like man Samson You Know This Woman's plotting on you you know I mean she's you know she's fixing that she's fixing to take you out and you just keep doing it over and over and over and you know that's how it is that's how the Devil Comes upon you he makes you feel like he's your friend he makes you feel like that it's okay doing what you're doing because you can bust out of it you might go listen to some some music you're not supposed to and all of a sudden you can come in church and feel the spirit of the Lord or you can you can drink something or you can watch something or you can do something and all of a sudden you can come in and you can sing or you can preach or you can play music or or you can do these things and the spirit of the Lord still be upon you but the thing was was that she pressed him daily and the spirit of the Lord knew that that what was fixing to come and then one day the scripture says you know that Delilah was like you're making a mockery of me you know you're you're you're making fun of me you know and she was trying to play the victim when when really Samson was the victim you know and and she began to say you know you know what is the secret of your strength you know and if you're not careful you begin to give up the secret of your strength you begin to give a you know that it's whether it's prayer and reading your Bible and listening to the message and and you know and and the the the spirit of the Lord that comes upon you but yet Samson begin to begin to compromise with the world and he begin to compromise with the w with Delila and he begin to tell her that I'm a basically I'm a chosen Son of God and and and and I and and I have a promise and I have I have there's a there's a there's I have a vow I'm a Nazarite and there's never been a razor struck to you know put to my head there's never been a time where where I have you see these locks right here this it's my genealogy it's who I am it's it's something that the Lord has put on my life and at that moment right there he sold himself out and the scripture says that he was laying in laying laying in the on the lap in the knees of Delilah and and she called another man to come and sure his hair and and sure enough she said Samson the Philistines are on you and he thought that he could get up and he thought that he would be able to get away from it and he thought that he would be able to bust out of it because the scripture says he thought that he would do it just like all the other times before but at that point at that point Satan had staked him to the ground and the scripture says now this was pretty interesting I begin to think about this that you know they could have did a lot of things to Samson they could have took his life they could have cut his hands off they could have cut his feet off they could have cut his arms his tongue his ears he could have did any of those things but yet they plucked out his eyes and if you go and you look you look at where brother brand where brother brandom's talking talking there and oh Lord once more it's the spiritual application that the eyes placed and you know what is you play long enough Satan will go after the spiritual application you won't be able to see that that it's Satan that's fighting that's fighting you in between you and your brother he won't you won't be able to see that it's Satan trying to keep you away from from listening to the ministry or being able to read your Bible that it's just the tiredness all you'll see is tiredness or all you'll see is just this brother or all you'll see is just this sister or all you'll see is oh that this person's in a bad mood or this that or the other but what he does is that Satan wants to get you in the flesh realm and he wants to get you into a place to where you're not seeing what God sees like oh you don't attack the person but you're attacking the spirit that's driving the wedge in between you and your brother or you know you're attacking the spirit that's driving the wedge in between you and your prayer life and your and your and your time with God because Satan will throw many things he'll throw your responsibilities if you you know you us men you know we got responsibilities to make and we got you know deadlines to do we got bills to pay and you know we got you know we got cars to fix we got Lawns too we got you got a lot of stuff you know it's just a lot of things that we got that we got to do or you sisters about how that you know that you got children to take care of you got supper to make you know you've got you've got the house to tidy up you got laundry you know you've got you got things that you're doing around and if you're not careful you just become obsessed with all the things of life and you know what we don't realize what the enemy is trying to do because our purpose is not just to clean the house is not just to go to work but your purpose is to defeat the enemy here on this Earth and it's not your brother it's not your sister it's not it's not things that's going on out there in the world but it's the the it is Satan and his army that has been designed to be able to come after the believer and that was the issue was was was Samson forgot who his enemy was he forgot who who in fact he was laying in their lap but but yet now we see the scene where Samson his eyes were put out you know a a man of God if that's the way that you want to put it he was there and and he was sitting there and and and he was there and and and and the scripture says in the next verse that he was grinding at the meal of the enemy you know you know and and he had a lot of time to think then he had a lot of time to think about what he was and and all the Mountaintop experience where he was slayed a thousand Philistines and and you know he he captured the foxes and you know he killed the lion and all the different things that he had done but yet he was grinding at the meal of the enemy and you know if we're not careful we'll grind at the meal of our enemy we'll sit there and help produce you know that's what it is you know you go to a meal whether it's a great meal or whether it's a wheat meal or what whatever it is that's there they're grinding they're grinding that up for purpose and we want to we don't want to we want to be careful that we're not grinding at the Mill for the enemy for their purpose where where we're not sitting there and we're helping build his kingdom we're like you you see what I'm saying we we're we're not we're not there establishing his kingdom by thoughts and by words and by and by things that we say and things that we think but yet Samson was standing there and he was at the he was at grinding at the meal and and he was and he was just sitting there thinking Lord you know and we get to that place you know sometimes in our life where where we may not feel the presence of God in our in our or we may not feel the presence or we might we might not feel his presence in our Bible study or or in the song service or you might not you might not feeling when you're listening to a message or just the spark isn't there you know and and we might be sitting there thinking Lord where you at you know but God hasn't left you the thing is is when God gives the promise amen it's from the beginning all the way to the end I mean I mean there's a lot of us that are sitting in this church here this evening that was started by God but God hasn't left you and God is more than willing to finish his purpose in our lives and and he began to sit there and but the thing was is is the Philistines now this is the part that kind of gets to me was was the Philistines were proud of what they did the Philistines you know man it was a big deal to capture Samson you know because this man has slaughtered thousands you know you go back and you listen to the message where brother Brandon's preaching you know oh Lord once more there in 63 you know and he begins to say that you know that wasn't this the man he began to say that how that the soldiers were there and their AR he had they them them them Warriors had their big old arms around there uh you know you know to cut it short he just says the Jezebel you know them Jezebel women you know and he put their arm around their Jezebel women and he begin to they begin to talk to him and say well this was Samson this was the this was the man that just that his name would breed fear throughout the camp of the Philistines you know just his name you know when they said that oh we're going to have to go to Samson you know the the men got scared but now here he is his eyes are put out and he's being let LED around with the child you know the you know brother brandham says that that it was it was and the scripture says that it was actually A Feast for the god of deeon the fishon and that about how that they were going to take Samson for sport that they were going to take Samson for sport in front of the enemy and and he said that he you could Samson would sit there and just remember about what he would just sit there and think about all the times that he had think about all the times that he had defeated the enemy but now he was defeated by the same ones that he was meant to defeat and if we're not careful amen Satan would take our lives if we choose to give up if we choose not to if we choose just to stand there in self-pity and just stand there amen and let our prayer lives go to pot and left and let our services go to pot and let our let our times with the Lord go to pot and we just stand there amen Satan was waiting for the moment to to put Samson out in front of the Philistines you know the scripture says that all the Nobles had got together all the Lords had got together all the the men of prestige you know they' all come there he said it was 3,000 men just upon the roof that was there and they they were all sitting waiting for the main event now and that's the thing that that Satan so wants you Satan so desires to take your prayer life Satan so desires to take you singers to your song away that that you sing here you preachers he so desires to be able to take your gift and to be able to put it up on sport for all the world to see brother brandham says that it was it was it was like a trophy for the enemy that he could they could just sit there and say oh isn't this the mighty Samson isn't this the one that that we once feared and the one that we we were worried about and but yet the Deon Our God has given us the great Deliverance but but Jehovah was not going to stand by and watch his children just be used for sport he wasn't just going to stand by and watch and see the promise that he had given in Samson's life just to be able to go down into the gutter and I tell you here this evening God is not going to let one of his children amen fall and fall down and be used as Satan's amen trophy case somewhere but but yet when Samson was mealing there the you know the there's a little scripture right here and scripture says that in the middle of his mealing that he was he wasn't paying attention but his locks begin to grow back and the promise that was given to him begin to grow back and in the middle of your trial there's a seed that's laying down in the inside of your hearts that that wants God that needs God but yet there's something that's hindering you say you know the thing that Samson had to do was he had to come to full surrender in his life he had to come to a place where it was like lord it's not my strength it's not my ability but it's you that comes over me that I can that I can come and I could do these things and the scripture says when something else that I thought was unique that they didn't bring him out with with chains and they didn't bring him out with with an armored an armored parade but he had to be led by a lad he had to be led by a child and I begin to think about that about how that it's still just a childlike faith that has to be has to resonate in our heart that we have to be led amen by a by this gospel and he said you know you know Samson was like don't take me to a don't don't give me a sword don't do this don't do that but just take me to the place to the pillars where where this place is standing you know and he begin to stand and he begin to be led there his eyes are put out and you might be here this evening thinking Lord amen my my prayer life is gone my my song is gone my this is gone my that is gone but you know what you begin to empty out you know you begin to reach back and you begin to feel those locks those locks and the promises that God's given you amen because once God God gives a promise in your life he's obligated to it and he would he would much rather or he will he will make sure that his word will go through a mean in your life you know Samson you know he begin to go out there and he begin to come and he begin to say Lord once more and here this evening I my my prayer is is is that Lord once more I pray as we're closing at the end of this at the end of this uh H H Church age or the end of time that we're coming to and we are that Samson amen we are those people we are the individuals that God's called all that you know it doesn't matter what Walk of Life you've been in you may have been in church all your life or you might have just started yesterday but there's a reason that you sit in this building there's a reason that you sit here is not because as I said that you were just raised in church but yet there's a deep that's calling to the Deep there's something that that's drawing you to be here because it's the word that that that that that's so pulsating in your body that the desire for you to be here and I begin to think here about how that Samson he walks himself up to the pillars and he says Lord once more and and he and he begin to push on the pillars and the strength of God came back on him and you know we begin to think in our lives Lord what would it take to me to be able to get back into this position what would it take for me to get back in prayer what would it take amen for me to be get back to the place where where I first once was and where Lord your your power was radiant you know you have to be willing to die with your enemy you have to be willing to be able to say you know what Heen it doesn't matter what I what people think of me it doesn't matter what what the world's going to say it doesn't matter if they think I'm crazy it doesn't matter if they think you know that person is falling off their rocker but Lord once more in my life that I can destroy the enemy of my life for my children that I could destroy the enemy of my life amen amen for my community that I can live a prosperous life you know and Samson begin to get out there and he begin to push against the pillars and and and it said that in Samson's death that he killed more Philistines at his death than he did when he was alive and let that be said in a spiritual sense here here this evening amen if God's leading you to a rededication of your life if God is leading you to you know what I can do more for the kingdom I know I can do more I'm just hindered by this thing or I'm just hindered by that thing amen I say go to the pillars of your issue amen I say go to the pillars amen that's holding you back amen and begin to push against these things and you might say Lord amen my eyes my eyes of spiritual understanding have been put out for so long but Lord once more in my life let me face face to face with my enemy that I can come against it and I could I could utterly destroy him utterly destroy it utterly destroy it and that's what God's Desiring here this evening is that we could utterly destroy the enemy amen that we could come against it and we can put it down in the grave forever because we don't have much more time left here on Earth amen we're the last push where the last goal we're the last group of members amen and if there's something that's inside of your heart this evening amen that's screaming out Lord once more in my life let me not sing this song the same way that I have before but Lord hook me up to the jumper cables of your word and then let me come alive let me come alive CU a lot of times we sit on the bench a lot of times you know in our Christian walk we sit on the bench because we're worried about what this person thinks we're worried about what that person thinks we're worried about oh what if I do then I'm going to have to I'm G to have to you know give this up or I'm GNA have to give that up you know I'm G to have to put I'm going to have to lay my pride on the line Samson would have never been able to to to knock down the pillars of that building building had he had not ever been able to put everything on the line brother brandom says there in in in that same message oh Lord once more there in 63 you know he says you know that's the problem with the church today he they're not willing to put it all on the line is that our problem here this evening speaking for myself I ain't speak speaking at anybody I'm just just putting it all as Josh's fault Josh should have been preaching here this evening but is that is that where we're at you know the thing is is brother Brandon pointed out something pretty beautiful when he said that the framework of Samson was there the same Samson that killed all those Philistines the framework was there he said but the spirit of God wasn't there that was the problem and if we're careful we might have the framework together we might have the framework together where we sit on the front pews Boys on this side girls on this side we got our ushers and deacons in the back we got our certain musicians that come here in the church and you know we got the people that run the sound booth up there at the Crow's Nest you know everything's everything's all formed everything's put together you know all the things are put together on the screens and you know the music is just right but if we're not careful we'll have a framework we'll have a framework right here in the message church I'm not even talking good A lot of that message he's he's talking about the Pentecostals a lot of that message you know he's going on and he's talking about you know we have a frame but if we're not careful here in the message we'll have a framework we'll have a framework of you know what you know I showed up and I'm wearing I'm wearing my long hair and I got my skirts and you know and and this that and the other but we're missing the presence we're missing the spirit we're missing we're missing something that's the we're missing the life we we'll have the body here we God's got hands but yet there's no life behind it to where God can use it and that was the problem with Samson he got to the point where he was unusable and Lord let us not be unusable to God's spirit Lord let me not be unusable let let me not get to a place Lord don't let the enemy put my eyes out don't let me come to a place where I can't spiritually see what's going on because Samson had got to a place where he was he was he was he was he was with the Enemy he was with the devil in fact he was trying to marry Delilah I mean he was trying to get with Delilah and and Satan found his weakness and if we're laying in the lap of Delilah here this evening I I I let me persuade you that she will sell you out he will sell you young men out Amen to to to the things of this world he'll sell you out to to to entertainment he'll sell you out to amen trying to you know trying to take on your responsibilities and trying to move on with God but don't move further than God is don't move further you you know you ladies you know you're raising your children and you know and some of you are grandmas and taking you know and taking care of grand grandbabies and and you know all of us in our respective places and you be careful amen because Delila the enemy is seeking the source of your strength and if you come into church and there's and there's something that's that's in between you and his Spirit don't be too prideful to be able to be like Lord once more in my life I want you to reach back and be able to feel the promises of God because the god that saved you in the church service wherever you was wherever you'd been in your life the same God that met you there is in this building here this evening God had never giving up on Samson he was just waiting for Samson to get to a place God had not giving up on him he was waiting for him to get to a place and sometimes it takes trial sometimes it takes situation where old Samson he he had had to be grinding for the enemy to realize oh my goodness where am I at where have I been what have I been doing and he had realize that I took God for granted and that's where it is and God will sit there in your corner with dirty feet God will be willing to be taken for granted in your life I love how it was brother w a while back where he was he was giving the analogy about how that when you know you first come to God and God's God's your first and all of a sudden you come into your things come into your life and all of a sudden you have children or or or you know I'm just using things for example I'll let you place things wherever they are because you know I don't know I can't read into your life and things like that you know but all of a sudden God's first and then your children might come in and all of a sudden God takes second and then all of a sudden you get a job and you you're trying to move on with your career and and then all of a sudden God takes third you know and then and then you get a car or you get this or you know whatever it is and all of a sudden God takes fourth and then God's Fifth and God's Sixth and God seventh and the next thing you know he's looking over and he's just standing over there and he's like here I am but yet we're so busy going around doing things for the world and going around doing things that that profited us but yet we left the flower in the mountain all of a sudden all the things that we've been blessed with be be careful cuz it could be a curse cuz the more you have the more you got to take care of I learned that with with animals you know we we got 20-some chickens you know and I got some ducks dogs cats and I'm like man now I got to take care of all these things well Haven does you know but when when she's gone I'm like now I got to take care of all these things you know and the thing is is we think that all these things are great and we need things in our life you need a car to drive you better get a job you know you you know you you know you need you know you you you girls got to do your things you know the what you know whatever girls do you know they do the they do their things you know I mean I was just looking in my little notebook that I had here and every single page of my 70 page little notebook has got some flower with a name written on it flower with a name written I'm like you just had all this time to flip through all these pages and just write their name and flowers around it you know and if we're not careful we begin to doodle in life we have no purpose we as our brother was saying you know you take you take you know your quiet time and the time that you could be using with the Lord and how many times have we pushed on our pushed on turned on our our message app and how many times have we listened to a message or you know get on get on and and and you know read our Bible or do these other things but yet we lay in the lap of Delilah as if nothing's fixing to happen she's sapping you of your strength she's sapping you of your of your ability to be able to see what's going on because there's a lot of things that are going on in this world that the message has spiritual eyes on we know where this we know what's going to happen with the money in the United States we know that a Superman's coming you know we know you know we know where the gold really is you know I just thought it was pretty interesting you know the president's like I'm going to go see the gold and Mr musk he's like yeah me too and I'm like man I wonder if it's really there I wonder I wonder if it really is there I wonder if if if the Vatican doesn't already have it these are things that we have but if we just go through with our eyes blinded we won't catch it when it comes by we won't catch the where we're sitting at in the end times we won't catch where we're at you know where we've been placed here at this time to see where it's at once more Lauren and if I could wind it down you know if I could wind it down to this once more Lord in my life there's been things that's been hindering us from the spirit of the Lord when it comes in the services or there's something that's been hindering us in our life to get closer to the God you know Lord you know if we've been grinding at the Mill at the Mill of the enemy you know it takes those moments to realize how good we actually had it you know W without suffering you know we don't we're not able to see you know we don't really see where God God you know took us from where we're at what we're doing until all of a sudden God's begins to shake the boat shake the boat a little bit and then we realize that Lord you know what I had it better with you we're like the prodal in our Spirits we we can do that I know we all have our wings and our little Halos on and stuff like that and I you know what you guys are angels you know you guys are angels but yet all of a sudden it takes these moments where things start happening in our lives where we realize you know what I had it better in the presence of the Lord I had it better in the presence of the Lord than football and basketball and I had it in the presence of the Lord because you know I learned a long time ago that those athletes can care less who we are they can care less who we are as long as we just keep buying tickets you know as long as we keep getting on their little things and getting on there you know what there's a lot of things that we do they can care less who we are amen they just want to sap your time and they just want to sap your energy and they just want to I mean sap your funds and be able to be able to say Hey you know you know uh you know we've got this person or we've got that person but you know what the Lord is looking for that point for your return the Lord is looking for you to be able to say you know what you know Lord I'm tired of grinding at the I'm tired of working for the enemy I'm tired of I'm tired of just standing here and and being a mockery for the devil because you know a lot of us who can look back in our lives and we could say where where where we was at the peak of our experience and where we are now you know hey you might be at the peak of your experience I don't know you know I don't know these things but you could be sitting here and looking at it and Satan sitting there reminding you of all the uh all the times and prayer that you had now look at you all the all the times you know that when you were reading the word and all of a sudden the word would just come fresh to you and he begins to point these things out and say you know look at and see where you're at now and all but there's still something in you that's crying out that's like Lord amen I don't belong in this state spiritually in my life I don't belong in this place where where I'm at but Lord Lord just take me to the pillars I mean because you got to get fed up that's the thing is you got to get you got to get fed up where you're at in your life you got to get fed up where you at in your experience because you know you you know what God's called you to you know I mean there's prayer warriors that's here you know there's preachers there's there's music positions there's you know wherever you fit at in the body of God you know you know where you're supposed to be but yet you know where you're supposed to be you know but but but you feel dragged down in your experience but yet God's telling you I'm still here God's telling you you know I could still visit you in your prayer life I could still visit you in you know when you're when you're at the music and I could still visit you ministers when when you when you're studying I and God is still here but we got to be willing to to die with the Enemy you know and that's one of my favorite parts of Samson you know is is right there at the end Lord once more once more let that be that way in every every service that we come to Lord once more maybe maybe maybe you're sitting here here this evening and you're you're thinking Lord I I goofed up you you might be here but you're not here you know what I mean you're here but you're not you know like like brother Harry so beautifully put out just a few minutes ago I mean how many of you heard this heard my sermon this morning they were there but they were not there you know and in church we could be here but we're not here but God is always here and you just like Lord restore my sight restore my eyes Lord give me eyes to have that I can see Lord what you're doing let me put out let me put off all these things in my life for just a few moments Lord that once more that I can soar in your presence that I can soar in your spirit without being hindrance of any and God will do that God will god'll God will take away all the barriers for a moment and and give you that refreshing and that renewing in your spirit but you got to want it you got to be willing to be led by like a by by a child you got to be willing to be led am me to the pillars of your enemy to where you could be like Lord if you don't do nothing for me in my experience Lord I'm going to die with this enemy you got to get so to the point you got to get so to the point that you're willing to make that sacrifice as the musicians come amen turn it over to brother Wendell we just take we've enjoyed what brother Harry said here this evening and and hopefully we've said something just kind of just laid it all out there i' just been putting listening to that message and you know it's something that's been resonating in my life something that Lord once more Lord let me let me not be laying in the lap of the Delila let me not be laying in the lap of entertainment or laying in the lap of you know of things that I shouldn't be and selling selling out where I'm at for the enemy because if you're not careful he's going to catch you off guard if you're not careful he's going to catch you off guard and he's going to be like oh the Philistines are on you and you can't break out and if you're to that place here this evening I'm going to tell you run going to beg you to run run away from it [Music] and you're like well I I'm just going to die here where I'm at no God's not going to let you die God's not going to let you go CU God's put a promise in you God's put a promise

service tonight I thought both the messages went right along with one another brother Harry amen you brother Mike you the Lord knows what he wants to say and and I believe mediocrity is is the greatest is the greatest destroyer and sapper of power than anything else mediocrity and um I I heard I I heard uh musk say something the other day that that is stuck with me talking about the federal government he says when you when you lack two things competence and [Music] caring then uh the government's bound to fall he said you got to have confidence and you've got I have people that care about what they're doing and he used he used the illustration of whoever had signed the the deal for the $5 billion Air Force One they you signed the contract and nego and and but when Trump come in he says listen we ain't paying no $5 billion for that if you want to build it for us we're going to give you a 1.7 billion for that and of course Boeing they agreed to it and he said now that's someone who cares what they're doing with your money and I thought there is a competent bride who cares about the Master's [Music] business we care about making sure that his word is fulfilled on Earth as it is in heaven we care can you say Amen did you know that brother brandham said that compassion is doing the will of the father brother brandham is saying the same thing that that I heard musk say the other day not not trying to justify musk I'm I I'm I'm not a I'm not into politics one way or the other I but if but I tell you what they've exposed a lot of lot of waste in the government haven't they been a lot of waste in the church been a lot of waste in there's been just a lot of waste but brother brandham said and and and I looked it up compassion and he said it many times compassion is doing the will of the father caring what he thinks caring about what his will on Earth is I thought that was good I want that kind of caring to know what he wants done and let me carry it out to the letter is there any competent folks in the bride is there any caring folks in the bride I'd say yes we are here and we care about the father's business about our Lord's business
