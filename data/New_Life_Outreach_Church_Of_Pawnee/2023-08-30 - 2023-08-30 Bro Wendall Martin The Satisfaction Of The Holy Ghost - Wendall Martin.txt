Lord amen we are wanting to just speak on satisfaction tonight satisfaction that the Holy Ghost brings and um amen I'm thankful for this wonderful satisfaction amen and what it means to to be satisfied I I believe that we should be satisfied with our Salvation we should be content and thankful satisfaction is is a fulfillment of one's wishes or expectations or needs amen it is it is contentment it is you're fulfilled amen A Satisfied person is Happy delighted joyful amen they're satisfied brother Branham would would mention in a Iman in a in a quote that I sent out yesterday he says wait till that satisfaction comes that satisfaction portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in then these Joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit will come you won't have to do it by the music you'll do it when you're down in the or down the road in your car you'll do it when you're sweeping the floor you'll do it when you're driving nails in a wall with your carpenter work wherever you are that joy unspeakable and full of Glory amen and I I I I think a Christian should be uh delighted in her in in in his Lord in their Lord amen Jesus says I'll not leave you comfortless he said I'll come to you that should bring satisfaction amen when you're in this world but you're not of this world it's good to have something to bring comfort and strength in in in the time of need amen when when you're there amen and and and the uh your body is is being uh tormented by the devil or your mind is being tormented by the devil maybe you're going through a trial of your life it's good to know amen that there is still an anchor within the veil that you can be satisfied with amen hallelujah how many knows that the demands of the law were satisfied by the atoning blood of Jesus Christ so there's no there's there's there's no sin that is held against you because God is satisfied God is satisfied with the atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ so God's not amen discontent with you and you're not discontent with him it brings just the joy bells of of freedom and joy in our hearts and in our souls can you say man amen that's right uh brother Branham would say now he say now here here it is after it's going away he said I will not leave you comfortless I will give you another in sign I will be lifted up from the earth and I'll draw all men unto me and the things that I do shall you do even greater than this for I go unto my father for he commissioned human beings to go to all the world and preach the gospel demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost until he returned turns as a sign it's a provided sacrifice tonight the the person of the Lord Jesus Christ in the person of the Holy Spirit here tonight proving himself to be Jehovah Jireh the Lord's provided sacrifice for your healing for your salvation for your Victory well can you say Amen so the satisfaction of of your healing the satisfaction of your deliverance was all through that atoning blood of Jesus Christ he says now you're healing tonight the person of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ returning in spirit form he said I come from the father I go to the father and a little while the world will see me no more yet you shall see me for I will be with you someone shout hallelujah but he didn't stop there he said even in you to the end of the world Amen as as Moses brother Branham would tell us as Moses was setting the the church in order as as each of the tribes we're told to pick up a stone as they were as they were going across the Jordan River that God had so supernaturally opened up and he told him he said now I want you to take a stone per tribe and I want you to bring over here and set it on Amen and and build a memorial a memorial of what uh God has done for you this day a memorial of God's delivering power a memorial he says that when you get discouraged you come right back and you tell your children amen this is what God done amen when when you're he says I want you to teach your children and your children's children bring them right back to that Memorial and let them know this is where God brought Deliverance Amen brother Branham would say now amen he says that was the setting of things in order he was doing it God's provided way and he went and got a stone for each tribe of Israel and you know hey what's the matter today we try to roll up a Pentecostal Stone and say this is it and the methodists roll up a stone and say this is it but God wants us to roll them everyone together and have an old-fashioned Holy Ghost pouring out on the whole church everywhere oh brother did you ever did that go home I felt that yes sir that's what we need today brother is bring every believer together and preach the gospel don't hold anything back but preach the full gospel of Christ until the baptism of the Holy Ghost is poured out all over the church and that's the way to have a revival can you say Amen I'm talking about sadness satisfaction amen there's a lot of things to try to do to entertain you and many things try to uh uh lure you one way or way or at night that the church should not be satisfied with anything then the Lord Jesus Christ I I'm talking about a satisfaction that amen when you're satisfied you you you don't have a craving for anything else when you're satisfied amen there's there's other things around that doesn't tough amen you know doesn't that doesn't affect you as if when you're hungry amen they say never go shopping at Walmart you know for groceries or anything when you're hungry Hallelujah you'll come back with a lot of stuff that you don't need is that right but when you're satisfied you know I I think as brother Colby was singing that song Satisfied With Jesus amen sadness fried with old Prussian prayer satisfied amen with the experience of God God talking to you and letting you know that you're his satisfied amen with with him you know uh uh coming upon you and and giving you and feeding you and encourage you can you say amen Amen brother Benham talks about satisfaction you know he he always goes to a nursing baby amen and he says that may be that is laying close to Mama nursing amen he said now that baby is fat that that baby is secure that baby is settled that baby is being nourished that baby is satisfied it can be crying one minute amen but you give him his mama and let him go to eating in the bed amen the little legs are just a kicking in the and the arms just a swinging amen what is it he found his satisfaction I I say tonight amen that John the great God Almighty the El Shaddai is still with us in this hour that we're living in God says I want to be your breasted one I want to be El Shaddai I want to be almighty God unto you amen I'm your satisfier amen if you have any need I'm the one that gives it to you if you have any problems of Amen I will nourish you if you're discouraged I want to be that in your life that's what the holy spirit is sent to us for amen I I will Hallelujah you know I think we need an old-fashioned refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen an old-fashioned refilling amen that that old-fashioned refilling to the bells of joy and shouting it amen and dancing returns back to our hearts again well hallelujah amen that Joy where you're singing in the daytime The Joy when you're waking up Amen in the morning with a song on your heart you know I think God gets Glory when we have joy in our hearts for him amen Amen brother Branham would say he says now that the Holy Ghost has come to give you power now we think about that word power that word power is dunamis amen it comes that's where we get our word Dynamite it's it's explosive it's something that amen there is that there is power to amen if you got if you've got rocks in your way and you're trying to build a road they use Dynamite amen when things are when it just comes up to to something and it just that just won't budge and a hammer ain't gonna do it and a jackhammer ain't gonna do it amen to pull out the dynamite and I I want to say Jesus was saying here amen the Holy Ghost will give you power in in my name you'll cast out devils in my name you'll you'll speak in new tongues in my name you'll lay hands on the sick I'm giving you something that the devil cannot resist amen he would say he said it twice he says the Holy Ghost has come to give you power the Holy Ghost come to give you power amen he says you you you you give you power power and prayer amen you take a person that's lived a good life that's that's always defeated oh I tell you a good person oh I I sure love the Lord Brother Brad I must always defeat him they've never get a prayer answer you feel that woman with a holy ghost one time and watch what takes place when she goes before the Lord she's not defeated she's coming boldly before the throne of grace believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God by a birth take that little man so cowardly the Boss Kick him all over the place amen and I'll say wait a minute here now amen something has changed he's got the Holy Ghost it gives you power your life is full of power amen when you've got authority over the devil you start smiling when you've got authority over the devil you start acting like you've got Authority it don't matter what the symptoms say it don't matter what this what what what the situations around us are saying amen Authority faith is reaching out Faith steps in human may be in this you may be in this realm of of circumstance and defeat but Faith reaches out and clings to that promise of God you have already got the power of the Holy Ghost in you to make that word to live all you've got to do is connect the holy spirit with this word and it will bring that word to pass can you say Amen yes sir Amen brother brother Brandon would tell us he says amen the Holy Ghost is a sign to the world that you're a new creature well praise the Lord what what does that mean for me that means you're not defeated anymore that means sin don't have you anymore imagine that means the the you know the Mali grubs don't have you anymore you are a new creature amen he said so the Holy Ghost becomes a sign to the world he also says that it is a seal amen it'll seal you in he talks about the Box Cuts how let the holy spirit amen will seal you up to where there is no devil can get into you and the Holy Ghost can't escape from you you can be sealed into the kingdom of God well praise the Lord amen hallelujah he would also tell us that a seal you know you you take that seal a notary public they'll uh that they'll come and stamp that a notary will stamp that paper and it is and it is it's got a seal on the front side it's got a seal on the backside Amen brother random says that you are sealed coming and going amen the devil sees the seal and you see the seal the world sees the seal and you see the seal on the inside of you amen it's not just a one-sided deal to where you're a man of eye everyone else sees a seal but on the inside you're lacking faith and you're lacking confidence and you're lacking power he says you're going to see it inside and outside amen matters in fact the scripture that old song says it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh I want to change in my life can you say amen amen what is it there is something that has taken place in here that is given a satisfaction I say tonight I'm satisfied with my Jesus I'm satisfied even let Joy be in my heart let praise be upon my lips whether I'm in the Lion's Den or fiery furnace or whether I'm Amen in the whale's belly I've got a confidence that he that has begun me will complete that word can you say amen Amen brother Branham says he's our comforter now I'm talking about her satisfaction now he's our comforter in whom they're they're in they're in in John 16 and 7. nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for I go not away for if I go not away the comforter will not come to you but if I depart I will send him unto you and then he turns right around in another verse down and he says I will come unto you Amen brother Bradham says he's our advocate amen he's our attorney he's one that is pleading amen the case for somebody else on somebody's a behalf amen he's a pleader in the court of law he is right there that no matter amen you might get in trouble but but you've got an advocate that is standing right you've got an attorney well praise the Lord amen sometimes you got to have an attorney amen and every one of you when you've got the Holy Ghost you've got an attorney you've got an advocate when Satan's there a man pointing his finger at you you have got an attorney amen are you hearing me he's also an upholder he is also a supporter amen he's our teacher well praise the Lord Brother Branham says he is our guide amen Isaiah 28 says he is our rest amen the scripture says he is our promise amen it causes the word to go into action in your life half the Holy Spirit brings satisfaction amen the unction of the Holy One now they're they're in in first John 2 and 19. and a man is breaking a distinction between those who didn't have the Holy Spirit and those that did he says they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not of us but ye have an unction you have an unction from the Holy One and you know all things can you say Amen what is that unction it is the authority to use the word it's the authority to believe the word amen you know I I say you know we don't speak too much on the Holy Ghost as far as the importance of of receiving it but Jesus said amen that we should he told the uh the disciples he says go to Jerusalem and stay there in Jerusalem until you be endued with that power from on high amen Jesus told him and you will become Witnesses unto me amen now now he's saying nah amen I want you to stay there stay there stay there until you get that unction because it's the stay in power it's the grit power amen it's the anointing that that breaks the Yokes amen it's the power of God unto salvation brother random says now you you you we've been taught a lot amen we've got a lot of the mechanics together but he says what we need now is the Dynamics we're missing we're we're missing the Dynamics we don't put enough stress on the Dynamics and I say there's where we lose our joy is because the Dynamics the Holy Spirit isn't there and it's not our satisfying portion as it should when you're satisfied you're satisfied when you're satisfied and we'll praise the Lord amen prayer when you're satisfied with him prayer is easy when you're satisfied with him it's a jaw had to read his word when you're satisfied with him it's a joy to come to church when you're satisfied with him amen that kind of a satisfaction amen there is something there that's running way down deep you're satisfied there is joy unspeakable and full of glory amen to half has never been told there is something that's way bubbling up out of your out of your inner belly rivers of Living Water you can't put the joy out you can't put well praise the Lord but if you Dam it up amen if the if if there is something over the spring that is bubbling up out of the ground then what good will it do you I say tonight let us amen take out all of the stops I say take out everything Lord take out carnality take out sin take out unbelief and let me be satisfied again let me be satisfied Let There Be joy in my heart Joy on my lips joy in my home joy in the car joy joy joy Wherever I Go man brother Bradham says now the word is God in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and then Jesus said if you abide in me and my word in you you ask what you will and it'll be done for you that's staying with Christ in his word don't go right or left stay right with it see and then it's actually not your word then it's his word and his word has the power and the authority behind it now if the Holy Spirit which is God's word amen or the power of God's word comes in with God's word it'll make God's word display itself go you into all the world and demonstrate the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe what a beautiful setting this is if we could just go deep now and listen that was the credentials that was to hang on every man that went forth preaching the gospel no man has a right to preach the gospel without the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter or Jesus would not let Peter James and John or any of the rest of them preach the gospel until they waited in the city of Jerusalem until of the Holy Ghost had filled them because it's the holy ghost that makes the word of God go into action somebody somebody look at your neighbor and say it's the Holy Ghost that makes the word of God all right let's start over and let's all do it now the Holy Ghost makes the word of God go into action hallelujah amen oh yes you see we've got the word we've got the word but you see what we need is a refilling of the Holy Ghost you know what would be good is for a good old refilling of the Holy Ghost before Wednesday night got here it would be a really good thing to have a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen where the glory of the Lord would just amen Hallelujah you say oh brother Wendell now it's just hard you just don't understand I understand we're living in laodicea I understand that there's a lot of wet blankets Amen on out there on our Holy Ghost I understand that it is a lacks amen of people's rights amen it's a it's a it's a relaxed uh uh lukewarm environment that we're living in but I say tonight it's worth letting the power of the Holy Ghost to come back and bring that satisfaction again oh glory to God you say it's hard to pray brother well it's hard for prayer meetings I just want to say you you just dig down deep enough there's a spring there's a well it's just got a bunch of junk in it amen let that thing back loose let the Holy Ghost come forth let the power of God rise in our lives can you say man remember the random says Noah as persistent as he was he heard God one day this runaway Prophet on the backside of the desert amen he he really come on them sacred sounds Sands to where every Minister ought to come amen no matter how many doctors degrees he's got a professor of college or whatever he may be he has no business behind the pulpit until first he's caught on that sacred sand between him and God Alone amen that he's that he's got an experience with god with no scientist in the world could ever hammer away from him they can take that word and cut it any way they want to and the devil uses the word and he proved it he uses the word cut out his own program but when amen hallelujah and one has ever been back there on them sacred Sands where nothing but you and God Alone can stand all the scientists in the world couldn't take it away from you because you were there and you met God and you know what happened can you say man Emmanuel's old the the the the old church the first church was such a powerful force amen they were they were so powerful until a man their speech was changed their attitudes was changed their amen they had something that the world needed and they weren't ashamed of the Gospel anymore I think sometimes he mind we we we we allow a man a a a real a real damning Rock they Mountain to be put over that gusher we we allow Hallelujah amount that Spirit of being ashamed that that Spirit of a man of well I I'm ashamed I I don't I I don't know what they'll think of me I don't know what they'll amen but Peter and John and the rest of them that that were in the upper room they were ashamed too amen they were ashamed they they they didn't want to tell anybody that Jesus raised from the dead amen because they they there was a lot of critics out there I want to say tonight I want so full of the Holy Ghost that I can tell the world what has taken place in this day I I want to be so full well praise the Lord I've heard people say well I don't say much to anybody because I I just don't want it to come back on them because once they know amen that oh my and I I I I'm looking at that and I'm thinking I don't really understand that the Bible says go into all the world and share this gospel share what you've got I don't think we should be ashamed of this message I don't think we should be ashamed of our Prophet I don't think we should be ashamed amen but what we need is a good old-fashioned a baptism of the Holy Ghost and power to make this thing live in me again hallelujah amen it's hard to really say much about it when you're not on fire about it it's hard when you've lost your passion you don't want to talk about it but if you can ever get refilled with the Holy Ghost you say we need to be revealed I think it's filling up on top of feeling and refilling upon top of refilling can you say Amen they were filled with the Holy Ghost in Acts 2 and they were already seeking for the Holy Ghost in Acts 4. what I'm saying is is God I want that satisfaction again I want to sit there in the middle of your spirit feel the joy amen feel your power I want to know that I know I want there to be a passion about this in my heart once again can you say ma'am Peter James and John and like the rest of them were fearful what will the people think Hallelujah amen what if they don't agree with what I'm telling them amen did Jesus really indeed raise from the dead and they remind him what is he what are they going to say when we say that he appeared to us as disciples amen hallelujah brother says that's a as they sat there as they sit there and and maybe Peter was looking out the window and he and he started looking out there and the man and he saw Dr Jones out there in your mind and and uh he man and and and he was he was uh brother Branham says that Iman he was scared and he was cowardly and and he says now what if Dr so and so don't understand any man and he and and and and these disciples were all out there in in that upper room I mean man they weren't there just necessarily uh as stalwart uh uh uh men and women full of Faith they were up there hiding is what they were doing but they were there under a promise they were there under a promise you just wait until the power comes and so they're waiting for the power of God to come but they're still nervous about the deal and amen but oh brother amen and I think that's the way it can be sometimes today amen we we we can we can look around and amen and we're cowardly with our testimony we're cowardly to say that God healed us amen what what if God what if what if what if the sickness comes back or even then they'll think that you know that that I didn't have faith or uh and we're we're cowardly to share what God has done but I I just want to say it don't matter whether you start out on the water amen and start sinking or not you're still a Believer and you have a right to to testify of the goodness of God in your life and the grace of God in your life the love of God what he's done for you amen oh come on church amen where where you were when you were when you first came to the Lord and how you loved him and oh Church of the Living God I say the satisfaction is still Among Us it's still Among Us oh just let up amen let that whole let the Old River flow back out let the power of God so come upon us again can you say amen amen what if my boss doesn't understand it don't matter I am satisfied what if my friends don't understand it don't matter I am satisfied it does not matter I have found my satisfaction in the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh I'd better be careful I better be careful amen what if the devil just comes and gives me my sickness back you just stand right there toe to the toe with the devil and say that is mine and you're not taking my testimony you're not take what can you say man amen hallelujah you know I well I I I I I I just don't want someone saying anything bad about the message so I'm just not going to say anything at all how are they going to hear if there's not somebody that is satisfied with this message I tell you what if you're convinced then you'll be concerned if you're convinced that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if you're convinced a mind that Malachi 4 amen is the key to the Rapture if you are convinced I say tonight let the world know about it amen yes sir amen so there's Peter Iman he sees uh Rabbi so and so with with all of his doctors degrees and he's walking down the street Peter's there saying you know I remember selling fish to him amen one day and and I I didn't know a thing he was talking about he said oh man I could never stand up against him amen oh but when the tenth day came around Hallelujah you win the whole when the anointing of the Holy Spirit Come Around something Supernatural was fixing to take place it wasn't going to be another learning it wasn't just going to be another man it wasn't going to be Jesus in person but when they were in one place in one mind in one Accord when the day of Pentecost had fully come the Bible says that that great fiery cloud of God the one that was with Moses the one that appeared to Moses the one that took Elijah home that great great big amen fire came down and it split up and it filled them it was not just with them but it feel told them well praise the Lord amen you get so full of that it will satisfy you won't it amen that's exactly right amen now he walked with them in flesh Jesus walked with him but now he's fixing to fill their very being the satisfaction the satisfaction was going to so resonate that they would never be the same again this satisfaction was going to so fill that Soul it was going to so feel that heart there was something that was taken that was coming in and abiding with them you know what it was it was the soul that was created for the Divine one to live in in the first place why why are you satisfied with the holy spirit because your soul was created for that divine presence of God to live in Hallelujah well can you say man amen hallelujah finally uh it when the day of Pentecost had fully come when they were in one place in one Accord God had been above them in that fiery Cloud God had walked with them on the earth God now something else was going to take place something's fixing to happen they were all in one place and one Accord and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the room where they were sinning cloven tongues set upon them what is clothing it's parted like stammering did you ever hear somebody stammer they they go up brother Branham imitates someone stammering he's you see they can't say nothing just clothing parted like a cloven hoof amen means something that is split parted up that's they wasn't they wasn't talking they wasn't jabbering they wasn't doing nothing but making some noise and clothing tongue set upon them as it was a fire and all they couldn't hold themselves they were all filled with the Holy Ghost who and when then what happened out on the streets they went now amen where is that Rabbi Jones where is that fellow at where is that intellectual giant God was over them with Moses in the burning bush he fed them with Manna on high he walked with us for three years and six months here on the Earth but now he's in me it's not me that speaks it's him I know who he is I know who I am I ain't no more he is bring him up here can you say amen amen oh yes that'll take somebody and make them give them get give them a a an old-fashioned dose of good Holy Ghost boldness boldness to tell your neighbor that God still heals boldness to tell your friends that this message is real boldness amen when you come before God and believe God for miracles when the doctor says there's absolutely no hope boldness to stand up and say I believe God can create I believe God can heal I believe God can save I believe God can deliver a boldness to stand up why because you have that spirit of God on the inside of you any man Hallelujah you remember the Brennan would go on he says now men of Israel you that dwell in Judea let this be known unto you and hearken unto my voice all you preachers and rabbis who my power of speech oh they are not drunk taken up with that little minority 120 now uh uh 120 against 10 000 or more they are not drunk as you suppose saying it's but the third hour of the day I'm a Full Gospel preacher but this is that this was that that was spoken by the prophet Joel amen it shall come to pass him the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit who upon All Flesh and you see Mary out there dancing in the spirit speaking in tongues and carrying on upon All Flesh upon my handmaidens will I pour out my spirit I'll show signs in the heavens above and in the earth below pillars of fire and Vapors of smoke God was in his people right then well now what do did you have what school did you come from it don't make any difference right now oh he begin to pouring in the scripture he found his satisfying portion can you say amen amen how many can stand uh up Toe to Toe to the night with the devil and say I am satisfied amen yes amen they're in Luke 10 and 19 behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions over all the power of the enemy somebody say all the power of the enemy oh if you've got the Holy Ghost on the inside of you you've got the power over all the enemy it never has been to you it's never been because you're Greek or Gentile or Jew it's never been because you're circumcised or uncircumcised it's because you're a new creature can you see man whole we stand right there Hallelujah when Jesus told disciples he said I give I get over over every devil all Devils to cure the diseases can you say Amen oh yes amen I'm so thankful for that amen I say tonight I don't want to be a man ashamed I don't believe a Christian should be ashamed of anything I don't think you should be ashamed of saying I believe God's going to heal me but it looks so bad when it looks so so a man indifferent when it looks like it's just totally impossible to stand up and say I'm believing God I I I believe it's okay to stand up any man in the midst of it all why because he's been so good to you and he's never lied why will he lie now why should he laugh oh yes I can trust amen can you see man yes I I like the way Peter brought in there in First Peter 1 and 6. you mind I I I I I love these these verses here it says wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaven it's the manifold and temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believe ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory oh come on Hallelujah did you know that the prophet said that it will be the Holy Ghost filled Believers that will judge your city he says as long as God's got a People God's got a church God's got the Holy Ghost marching with it that's what God gave the Holy Ghost for intellectuals will arise always have but God's got a minority somewhere God's got a little church that'll move right on with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to claim in the light and they'll be the ones that through their testimony will judge the world don't the Bible say Jesus said blessed are the pure and heartful they shall see God Amen the others says the just or the the Saints shall judge the world sure your testimony today will bring judgment against this city our testimony of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of God and a holy life will bring judgment against this city think about that the power now now here we've got laodice you and we have got all of these things as pulling and nagging and pulling this way and pulling that way amen got got them you've got your phones you've got your internet and all the social media you got all of these things that that are trying to to compete trying to compete for for your attention amen and if you're not satisfied with your portion amen you'll get you you you'll get wandering off here and there praise the Lord Hey listen if I'm satisfied with my girl she ain't got no problem with me amen uh uh being being swayed one way or the other from another girl I'm satisfied it's the reason why amen you should never let fights keep going on in your home you should never allow things to don't don't let wedges come and keep pulling them pulling and pulling because there's a plenty of devils out there that'll pull amen and try to just you know pull your attention away but if you stay if you stay satisfied you stay bound together well amen what God put together let no man no demon no no no no no internet no nothings put a sun or can you say amen amen and that's the way it is with God when you're in love with God and you love God and he is your satisfying person and you amen you're satisfied with prayer you love praying you love reading you love the church you love the things of God you love those things amen and it doesn't matter anything that tries to pull you this way or or that it just does not matter laodicea begins to lose its Hold On Me where glory to God glory to God hallelujah can I walk and lay out a seal with a satisfaction with God yes I can amen oh when the world is pulling amen every which direction I am walking with the King I'm walking with the King can you say amen amen oh yes you know there there you are amen you are judging the world right now amen they're they're falling for this and that they're amen they're going and they're they're going though the church world has totally taken after amen all of these spirits but I'm saying tonight God still has a witness a Holy Ghost Church that he's got his hand on a holy ghost people that the word of God can live in and live through and manifest his glory can you say man amen oh yes I'm satisfied I'm satisfied is that right amen I'm satisfied they mine now now as we as I uh look here they're they're in what shall we do with with Jesus called Christ brother Branham says the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies he says the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah is I like to liken it because it in in Pentecost it brought back not a green leaf but a tussle amen he says but the corn cannot say to the tassel uh uh or not not a green leaf not a tassel but the corn cannot say to the tassel I have no need of you or that also can't say to the leaf I have no use for you because of the same life that was in the leaf made the tussle the same life was in the tall so it made the ear it was a Lutheran Church that made the Wesley it was the Wesley church that made the Pentecost but Pentecost is what it's a restoration of the same kind of grain that went into the ground in the beginning bringing back all the fullness of the power of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the last days oh it's a great thing to believe to look at it now in this age that we're living in this age is beyond Pentecost Pentecost has settle down into organizations and started faking a whole lot about organizations we are this we are that he says that's just nature that's you can't help it it's nature they'll do that amen it's the plan for them to do that but the church has moved on it's going into greater more powerful the restoration of the gifts many many Pentecostal uh people does not even believe in Divine Healing Ministry of angels powers of God many Pentecostals cause these Visions I see the devil many organizations won't even have nothing to do with it now in Pentecost see we've moved beyond that we're just as methodists called for Pentecostal crazy for speaking in tongues just as Luther called Methodist crazy for shouting but it'll all come forth of the Holy Spirit to the great church is being filled up and chugged up Hallelujah he says of the great power of the almighty God until it's got to a place until the very works that Jesus done is manifesting itself right in the church can you say Amen so what is that telling us that means all the way to Glory there is a satisfying portion Hallelujah it doesn't matter whether he comes tonight or whether he comes tomorrow or whether he comes and he a year from now I've got my satisfying portion in the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not just sitting here waiting I am thriving in his presence thriving under the anointing of the Holy Ghost can you say man the satisfication satisfying comes Amen to that believer's heart don't don't you love him so much tonight amen yes I'm satisfied with Jesus he said he would be my comfort he said he would be my God Amen and I'm thankful for that here this evening now as we look forward to this meeting that is coming up amen I I want us to remind us I I don't know what you have need of I've got needs I don't know where you're at but I I I I'm needing a touch from the Lord hallelujah and you know what I'm going in believing because it's the children's bread ah I'm excited I know those ministers that are coming amen they've been they've they've already let me know that they're really Earnest in prayer they're Earnest in in seeking the the will of the Lord for the meeting and I'm I just I'm excited amen I I've got something on the inside that is saying oh it's just amen it's going to be joy unspeakable that's right amen hallelujah all Church of God we know we know I I you know you say well you know we've invited people to come before and it just doesn't seem like you know anyone it just doesn't seem like anyone's really interested in what we have don't ever get that way don't ever get listen don't let nothing put out the fire don't let no wet blankets put out the fire amen that's all right amen they tell you that in sales I don't I I forget the statistics you know but I mean Hallelujah I mean you've got to talk to like 50 people in in order to get a sale and um and and so I say tonight amen just keep on talking keep on witnessing keep on sharing what God's done for you amen get him here for the meeting amen be excited about it and get get some folks over here for the meeting well I don't know let it quit quit worrying about what they'll think about it get them here and you might have what they're looking for amen but but I but I'm saying amen lots of this is we just need a good old-fashioned amen baptism of joy a good old baptism of Joy come on now amen what did what did the Apostle or what did uh brother Branham used it a lot amen he talked about David he says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation amen he says now I never lost to Salvation he just lost his joy in other words he needed a renewing restore unto me the joy Hallelujah that's that's that's what I'm I I've been you know serving the lord for a long time now amen hallelujah been pastoring here for 34 years amen and and sometimes the Trials come this and sometimes you start reading things ahead of time well we know I've seen that before well I've seen that before well I amen and as Christians We Begin and before you know it you're you you you Elders us Elders begin to act like those old Hallelujah those old dead trees that brother random talks about amen the wind blowing and they start howling and amen ain't got no life in them ain't got no joy and he says they lost their leaves and they lost their Joy when they lost their leaves God done something for you you remember what God done for you you and God saved your soul when God filled you with the Holy Ghost you remember when God brought Deliverance to you nobody could shut you up you're a witnessing on the job you are witnessing that you places to go witness and talk about come on but then we get content amen and we've got he says what happened he says the life left those trees he says and those wind blow and he says it's the eeriest thing man and he had his hot horse tied up and there he was listening amen you could see the moon and hearing all of those the wind blowing through those uh uh old trees and amen there was many of them laying down there was many of them to just a standing and he says it was so eerie and spooky Hallelujah but then the holy spirit says he was that he had the Moonlight there shining and then the Holy Ghost began to show him down low he says but now look down low and his brother randomly looked down low and he says to all the little saplings that were coming up and all those little trees he says they were just frolicking in the wind he said they were blowing this way and that way he says they were having themselves a Revival amen I say God I I'm not dead amen I'm not going to be making that howling noise when the Holy Ghost comes around I want to renew it I want to renew renewing of the Holy Ghost renewing of his presence renewing I want a renewing of that Joy come on now joy and prayer oh yes how many has ever exp how many has ever loved prayer where you just you got into prayer and his presence was just so great and you said I never want to leave this place right amen he's still that same Holy Ghost today but yes he's still that same Holy Ghost how many how many just just just God was so rich to you and amen you you were you you you were fighting such a battle maybe you were fighting bitterness or maybe he was fighting uh you know uh feelings against another brother and then and then the Holy Ghost you just come and talk to him you you wanted his desires more than the feelings of uh that you can nurture that demons can nurture to you you know what I mean and you know what I'm talking about and and you come unto the Lord and you say Lord you created my heart to love and I just need your presence and then and then God just so Supernatural it comes down and you willingly go shake your neighbor's hand and you become a you become a friend to him why because something took place in that little secret place between you and God amen oh let him be our satisfying portion I
