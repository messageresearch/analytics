[28:50] were on Israel's side just a few months
[28:53] ago and because your base is is uh
[28:56] you're wanting to get reelected now
[28:58] you're you're turning Israel's fighting
[29:00] for her life amen we we they they have
[29:03] Nations all around them that are vowing
[29:06] to kill Israel and to annihilate the
[29:10] Jews there there are people in America
[29:13] that are walking around amen with signs
[29:16] that says kill the Jews we we have got
[29:20] this all over the world Amen where where
[29:23] the the world is turning against Israel
[29:28] but yet as we read here in this
[29:31] scripture amen when the day of the Lord
[29:34] comes and that there was this was going
[29:37] to to take place and amen but we also
[29:41] know that when the world when the world
[29:44] all turns on Israel amen that Christ was
[29:48] going to come and with him will be the
[29:52] Saints to fight for Israel do you see
[29:57] how close close we are can can you can
[30:00] you see amen when you see these kinds of
[30:04] things taking place because remember
[30:07] what Jesus said when you see the budding
[30:09] of that fig tree then you lift up your
[30:13] head because Redemption is coming nigh
[30:16] you you look at that and so Israel in
[30:18] 1948 amen become a nation and as as as
[30:23] as she all come back and that fig tree
[30:26] uh uh miraculously begin to bloom there
[30:30] in the midst of her enemies amen now as
[30:34] we a as we think about this I I've
[30:37] thought about World War I and and how
[30:41] amen uh Stalin and and Hitler and
[30:44] musolini and and and these guys had
[30:48] vowed to destroy Israel amen and and
[30:52] they killed 6 million Jews and and the
[30:56] war was going and and listen there
[30:58] wasn't very many Jews left amen and and
[31:02] if there was there were Evil Hearted men
[31:05] and and they were the ring leaders but
[31:07] there were amen there were there were
[31:10] thousands and thousands and thousands
[31:12] that were anointed of the devil to
[31:14] fulfill their evil desires amen and yet
[31:18] when we we we found that all of a sudden
[31:22] amen why did that world war stop amen
[31:26] why didn't they annihilate the Jews is
[31:29] because prophecy said there in
[31:32] Revelation 7 that that it says and after
[31:35] these things I saw the Four Angels
[31:37] standing on the four corners of the
[31:39] earth uh holding the Four Winds of the
[31:42] earth that that the wind should not blow
[31:44] on the earth nor on the sea nor on any
[31:46] tree and I saw another Angel ascending
[31:50] from the East having the Seal of the
[31:51] Living God and he cried with a loud
[31:54] voice Amen to the four angels to whom it
[31:57] was given given to hurt the earth and
[31:59] the Sea saying hurt not the Earth
[32:01] neither the sea nor the trees till we
[32:04] have sealed the servants amen now this
[32:07] is the Jews this is not the bride amen
[32:10] of our God in their foreheads and I
[32:12] heard the number of them which were
[32:14] sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of
[32:17] all the tribes of the children of Israel
[32:20] amen and the prophet would teach us he
[32:22] would say now amen the the what calls
[32:26] this the anointing upon the Earth was
[32:28] already here to kill the Jews but God
[32:33] stepped forward and say whoa hold back
[32:36] I've got to
[32:38] seal
[32:40] 144,000 amen 12,000 of of of of each
[32:44] tribe amen and I I I I I've got to make
[32:48] sure that they are sealed before uh this
[32:52] great uh battle begins to take place
[32:55] they were ready to go but he said you
[32:58] wait until amen now if the 144,000
[33:02] weren't on the earth amen there there
[33:05] there had to amen there had to be some
[33:07] Jews and and and God knows those elected
[33:10] Jews and so I you know amen I I'm here
[33:14] to tell you there the elect is there now
[33:17] there's the Servants of God can you say
[33:19] amen amen that God is going to seal with
[33:24] the Holy Ghost and amen and and of
[33:27] course the bride is going to be gone
[33:29] during this time when whenever uh the
[33:32] the the spirit of the Lord lifts from
[33:34] the earth and takes away the bride amen
[33:37] there will be the two prophets that come
[33:39] and preaches to them amen preach the
[33:42] same gospel that you've got they'll
[33:43] receive the same holy ghost that you
[33:45] receive amen and and then we it's it's a
[33:49] it's a great it's a great plan amen it's
[33:51] a great thing and and I'm here to tell
[33:53] you what is taking place right now
[33:56] Israel who is a very wealthy Nation
[33:59] Israel who leads in in the world in a in
[34:02] in a lot of areas amen is in uh in in in
[34:06] agriculture or not not agriculture but
[34:09] amen they they've got great business out
[34:11] of Israel amen and and but we're finding
[34:14] that there Israel is beginning to really
[34:18] call upon the name of the lord they're
[34:21] they're beginning to really begin to say
[34:23] listen amen we've got to get serious
[34:26] they are getting hit from from every
[34:28] direction amen I if you if you looked at
[34:31] you know what has taken place yesterday
[34:33] and the day before I mean uh that their
[34:36] fields are burning their houses are
[34:37] burning where they're where they're
[34:39] throwing these rockets in from the other
[34:41] side now and amen and and they're trying
[34:44] to keep the fires up they're getting hit
[34:46] from all around but Israel is beginning
[34:49] to cry unto God and beginning to ask the
[34:53] Lord amen we need your help and I'm here
[34:56] to tell you that what God's always loved
[35:00] Israel God has always loved Israel amen
[35:03] and I and at the same time we know if
[35:07] God is beginning to turn to Israel amen
[35:10] then the days of the Gentiles are now
[35:13] over the days of the Gentiles is getting
[35:16] close amen and you can tell it you can
[35:19] see because the seeds that Lucifer
[35:21] planted amen uh uh you know years ago
[35:26] amen 2,000 years ago 1500 years ago Amen
[35:30] in the church that early church and amen
[35:32] have now become great trees and the anti
[35:35] christ is totally rooted Amen in
[35:38] Christendom and and the great has
[35:40] influenced the whole earth we are
[35:42] setting Amen in Prophecy the stage is
[35:46] set for the coming of the Lord amen the
[35:49] stage is set for the Great Tribulation
[35:52] the T the stage is set amen for God to
[35:55] reveal himself to the Jews I'm here to
[35:57] tell you you we're living in an
[35:59] incredible time now all of this is
[36:01] taking place amen and while this is
[36:04] taking place the church has totally
[36:07] dismissed the word of God they have
[36:09] walked away from the word of God because
[36:12] they have been taught by that woman
[36:14] Jezebel aen who has offered things and
[36:17] idols and the a the Antichrist spirit is
[36:20] now the head of the the nominal church
[36:23] and brother brandom would say there amen
[36:26] uh in the in in the first or in the uh
[36:29] 125 of your books and and the very last
[36:32] uh uh paragraph he says when the church
[36:35] gets away from the word it will believe
[36:37] anything it is like Eve when Cain was
[36:40] born she said I gotten a man from the
[36:43] Lord amen now do you realize that she
[36:45] really meant that she thought that she
[36:47] had a man from the Lord you see once she
[36:50] had been deceived by taking the word of
[36:53] Satan instead of the word of God she
[36:55] then thought that what ever she said was
[36:59] right if she said she had a man from God
[37:02] then she had a man from God but God has
[37:05] set laws in his Universe a good seed can
[37:08] only bring forth good fruit an evil seed
[37:11] can only bring forth evil fruit can you
[37:14] say Amen so we can understand that Satan
[37:17] amen by his desire has sown his seeds
[37:22] into the womb of the church amen and
[37:25] literally millions and millions millions
[37:28] and millions of of the inhabitants of
[37:30] this Earth amen has is is has taken amen
[37:34] and swallowed his amen and taken the
[37:38] mark of that beast and and and you can
[37:40] see that when they have taken that Mark
[37:43] of that Beast amen the scripture says
[37:46] that they are sealed unto death amen
[37:49] there's no way now when let let me just
[37:51] say it this way when the angel of death
[37:55] strikes amen you may still will be
[37:57] living in your natural body but you have
[38:00] no way to discern good and evil you have
[38:03] no way your your conscience is seared it
[38:08] is numbed you can no longer amen see
[38:12] things as truth amen as good and evil
[38:17] you are you your your soul has been
[38:20] killed brother I want to tell you what
[38:22] you're seeing around here in the
[38:24] transgender movement and all of these
[38:26] things and you're looking at these
[38:27] people and you're thinking what kind of
[38:30] politics and what kind of plan I look at
[38:33] them and I know the word looks at them
[38:34] and said that the death angel has struck
[38:38] their amen their hearts and their minds
[38:40] the Apostle Paul says she that liveth in
[38:43] pleasure is dead while she lives amen
[38:47] they have taken the mark of the beast
[38:50] amen they have been sealed the death
[38:53] angel is striking well can you say Amen
[38:56] you remember back in Egypt
[38:57] amen it says apply the blood if you
[39:00] don't have the blood applied the death
[39:03] angel is going to strike that home amen
[39:07] and I that's the reason why Amen in this
[39:09] church amen right here in Pony oh God
[39:13] never let the death angel strike any
[39:15] home amen of our congregation never let
[39:19] the powers amen of of of of Satan amen
[39:23] begin to come in now remember how are
[39:25] you going to know amen that you've got
[39:28] that blood applied you were to take that
[39:30] Bloody lamb amen you were to kill that
[39:33] lamb you were to apply the blood and you
[39:35] were to eat the lamb and I'm here to
[39:38] tell you it was the word that was made
[39:40] flesh that hung on Calvary that we have
[39:43] applied to our heart and it's the word
[39:46] of God that we are eating and we're
[39:49] feasting on every word of God when
[39:52] you're feasting on the word of God Satan
[39:54] has no hold when you're feasting on the
[39:57] word of of God Amen your conscience
[39:59] cannot be touched by the enemy oh can
[40:02] you say amen I say tonight God if
[40:05] there's ever been a time for the church
[40:08] amen to get serious and understand that
[40:11] I'm in a predestinated time and that I'm
[40:14] part amen of the rapturing generation I
[40:17] believe we are here right
[40:21] now can you say amen amen that's right
[40:25] yes sir amen Jesus with saying in
[40:28] Matthew 10 and 28 amen it says fear not
[40:31] them which can kill the body but are not
[40:33] able to kill the soul but rather fear
[40:36] him which is able to both uh to to
[40:39] destroy both the soul and Body in hell
[40:43] and I and I want to say Amen when the
[40:45] death angel strikes you brother you're
[40:48] gone amen you have no way to discern
[40:50] good and evil anymore you have no way
[40:53] amen perhaps many have been given the
[40:55] chance perhaps many many heard the
[40:57] preachers perhaps many have have heard
[41:00] the message of the hour but because they
[41:03] rejected that now they stand Amen in
[41:06] death well can you say amen and what is
[41:09] it they are marked or they are sealed
[41:12] unto the second death amen and it is a
[41:15] very fearful thing amen there is no hope
[41:20] when you spurn the mercy of God can you
[41:23] say Amen now are you hearing me you see
[41:25] the mark of the beast is the mark of
[41:29] apostasy and it's there to try to amen
[41:32] it's the Antichrist Spirit to putting
[41:35] his seal upon his own
[41:39] people now brother Brandon would simply
[41:42] say the Ardon sin is to disbelieve or
[41:46] reject the Vindicated word of God Amen
[41:51] there there in Matthew 12 and and 31
[41:55] amen it would say Amen Jesus would say
[41:58] wherefore I say unto you all manner of
[42:00] sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
[42:03] men but the blasphemy against the Holy
[42:05] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and
[42:08] whosoever speaketh a word against the
[42:10] son of man it shall be forgiven him but
[42:11] whosoever speaketh against the Holy
[42:13] Ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[42:15] neither in this world or in the world to
[42:18] come can you say amen Amen brother
[42:20] Brandon would say Amen the first thing
[42:22] you know he says you may act ever so
[42:25] religious but your ears are sealed to
[42:26] the truth truth you remember when they
[42:29] when they you they would be so close
[42:31] till it would deceive the very elect to
[42:33] reject the gospel is to be sealed with
[42:36] the mark of the beast God marks you now
[42:39] what does it mean amen uh it was in in
[42:42] your head your ears in your head too
[42:45] what is it your head is the knowledge
[42:48] faith comes by hearing hearing um not
[42:50] some church rule but the word of God
[42:54] Amen First Timothy 4:1 it says now the
[42:57] Spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[42:59] latter times some shall depart from the
[43:01] faith giving heed to seducing spirits
[43:03] and doctrines of devils and and speaking
[43:05] lies and hypocrisy having their
[43:08] conscience seared with a hot iron now
[43:12] what is that seared mean it means to
[43:14] mark it is to Brand amen what do you do

[43:28] Amen in the fire and then you brand that
[43:31] cow and then everyone knows what brand

[43:45] amen it's it's anti- it's my own
[43:48] thinking it's my own opinion it's my
[43:51] well can you say Amen but if that if the
[43:54] devil's got a mark so does God have a
[43:56] mark he has a seal he says he knows his
[44:01] own and let everyone that names the name
[44:04] of the Lord let them depart from
[44:06] iniquity amen so God's got his seal amen
[44:10] what is that seal it's the baptism of
[44:13] the Holy Ghost amen and I want to tell
[44:15] you brother if you don't have the Holy
[44:17] Ghost you must get the Holy Ghost the

[49:27] the
[49:28] fence the token must be

[1:08:32] wanting
[1:08:34] Hallelujah but he's not going to throw
[1:08:36] the rest of it away because Israel was
[1:08:39] part of that
[1:08:40] too now they're not the bride they are
[1:08:44] the
[1:08:45] remnant they they are are are does God
[1:08:48] not love Israel now God loves his bride
[1:08:51] but God loves Israel
[1:08:56] the message the gospel came through
[1:08:58] Israel to get to
[1:09:01] you it was the Seed of Abraham and all
[1:09:04] the lineages and all the way going down
[1:09:05] through Jesus Christ but the Apostle
[1:09:08] Paul says the Seed of Abraham was Jesus
[1:09:10] Christ and if you want to be the Seed of
[1:09:12] Abraham you've got to come through the
[1:09:14] spirit of Jesus Christ and you are the
[1:09:17] Seed of Abraham are are you understand
[1:09:19] in other words God took the natural
[1:09:22] lineage to bring forth you and
[1:09:26] me the
[1:09:27] bride he's not going to throw away the
[1:09:31] natural seed he's not going to throw
[1:09:33] away Israel he's going to fight for
[1:09:36] Israel Israel has got a very special
[1:09:39] place in his mind can you say
[1:09:46] amen I believe that in this end
[1:09:51] time as we prepare
[1:09:56] for the coming of the
[1:09:58] Lord and we see Israel in the natural
[1:10:01] that these demons are
[1:10:05] fighting wicked
[1:10:07] men that are trying to kill
[1:10:11] Israel the prophet of God would tell us
[1:10:14] those 200,000,000
[1:10:17] Horsemen were
[1:10:19] demons and
[1:10:22] yes while they're trying to afflict
[1:10:24] Israel he says I want to tell tell you
[1:10:25] the real purpose is to get to the
[1:10:28] woman's
[1:10:29] seed is to get to the Bride of Jesus
[1:10:35] Christ why has Satan hated Israel so bad
[1:10:39] is because she produced the anointed
[1:10:42] one she was God's
[1:10:46] people Satan what you're seeing over
[1:10:48] there in the natural I want you to
[1:10:51] understand God is allowing what what
[1:10:53] you're seeing there in those natural
[1:10:55] guns natural missiles natural beheadings
[1:10:59] natural evil men is happening in the
[1:11:02] spiritual
[1:11:04] realm and they want to kill you I'm
[1:11:06] going back and I'm reverting back all
[1:11:08] the way to my beginning of the
[1:11:10] message that death
[1:11:12] angels are there with their guns pointed
[1:11:15] to you and the only way you will ever be
[1:11:19] secure is standing behind amen The
[1:11:23] Fortress of the word and being filled
[1:11:26] with the life of the Holy
[1:11:28] Ghost you'll never withstand that evil
[1:11:31] you cannot do it and just as Israel I
[1:11:35] believe what wasn't it nyaho that that
[1:11:37] that gave that that that that that gave
[1:11:40] the land for peace all of these many
[1:11:42] years ago
[1:11:44] well amen gave the land for peace and

[1:11:55] wouldn't allow wouldn't even allow them
[1:11:58] to even get get get come into that Gaza
[1:12:00] area that way they wouldn't be able to
[1:12:02] come in and and and and and and Lodge
[1:12:04] Rockets over at them but they said land
[1:12:07] for
[1:12:09] peace amen so they let the enemy just
[1:12:11] move right next door and there's just
[1:12:14] one little fence in between
[1:12:17] them well they broke through the
[1:12:22] fence and they've been doing this
[1:12:24] they've been doing this for years years
[1:12:25] and years and years and years these guys
[1:12:27] have been doing this to Israel for bukus
[1:12:30] of
[1:12:32] years huh digging tunnels digging
[1:12:35] tunnels under Israel dig yeah doing all
[1:12:38] of this kind but finally
[1:12:42] finally somebody said enough is enough

[1:12:46] push you back out but we're going to
[1:12:49] destroy you well I don't
[1:12:52] know I I
[1:12:56] I don't know if they're going to destroy

[1:13:03] even the
[1:13:07] score settle the
[1:13:11] score but those Devils that come in and

[1:13:34] lips the devil and every other
[1:13:36] denomination and every other church
[1:13:38] member or whatever else I am going to
[1:13:41] defeat you
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:45] devil come on I'm going to defeat you
[1:13:49] you might be you you might have got me
[1:13:51] yesterday you might be fighting my
[1:13:53] family you might be amen battling
[1:13:55] uh Dylan's knee and doing this these are
[1:13:58] demons that are out to to sideline you
[1:14:02] from your
[1:14:06] purpose but don't you ever forget that
[1:14:08] message that God's given you can you say
[1:14:11] Amen well glory to
[1:14:15] God so when we look to these things amen
[1:14:20] as I and and and and and I've got a lot
[1:14:23] more I could say but but why did God
[1:14:25] give us that word is because the word is
[1:14:28] the only thing it's our defense but it's
[1:14:31] also our
[1:14:33] weapon the word is not just our defense
[1:14:37] but you take the sword of the
[1:14:40] spirit
[1:14:41] Hallelujah the Bible says that when
[1:14:44] Jesus does come he's riding on a white
[1:14:46] horse and when you and I come Amen on
[1:14:50] the white horses that there will be a
[1:14:52] sword coming out of his mouth it will be
[1:14:55] his word to destroy the
[1:15:01] wicked it will be the same message that
[1:15:03] you are receiving it'll be the words of
[1:15:07] Prophecy it'll be Vindicated
[1:15:12] words if that's going to work in the
[1:15:15] Millennium if that's going to work when
[1:15:18] if that's going to work
[1:15:21] then why not use those words now
[1:15:25] why not take that
[1:15:27] devil and whoop
[1:15:31] him when brother prandom was given the
[1:15:34] the the Revelation to the seals and and
[1:15:38] the the the lamb opened the book and
[1:15:40] gave it to the seventh
[1:15:44] angel and when it was given to the
[1:15:46] seventh angel that open book and they
[1:15:48] made a big deal about it the Bible says
[1:15:50] it was a closed book now it's an open
[1:15:53] book and then the Declaration was for
[1:15:56] the people to come
[1:15:58] and eat
[1:16:01] it you were going to take the words of
[1:16:03] the Living God which is a two-edged
[1:16:05] sword the scripture says his words is a
[1:16:08] sharper than a two-edged sword you were
[1:16:10] going to place it upon your
[1:16:12] mouth you were going to eat it you were
[1:16:15] going to speak
[1:16:17] it when brother brandom was questioning
[1:16:20] the
[1:16:22] vision and he's up there on the mountain
[1:16:24] and his has his hands up in the air says
[1:16:27] I don't know what that meant those seven
[1:16:29] angels coming down I don't I don't
[1:16:35] understand when he had his hands up in
[1:16:37] the air asking the Lord would you please
[1:16:39] show
[1:16:39] me a sword appears in his
[1:16:43] hand and he's scared of a sword and he's
[1:16:46] looking at it and he's
[1:16:48] wondering what's this
[1:16:52] mean he's well maybe the a K sword they
[1:16:55] night they knite people with it maybe
[1:16:58] maybe the Lord means my Ministry is
[1:16:59] fixing to uh uh uh uh ordain ministers
[1:17:03] or something and then all of a sudden
[1:17:06] across the Canyons the king
[1:17:12] sword but then down deep in his heart
[1:17:14] deep he says now now no one said this
[1:17:17] audibly but down in my heart it just
[1:17:20] came out that said fear
[1:17:23] not this is only the third
[1:17:28] pool then he turns around and
[1:17:31] says so I'm loyal I must be loyal to
[1:17:36] this
[1:17:37] message for this
[1:17:39] message is the third
[1:17:44] pool putting the pieces together now
[1:17:47] brother's putting all the pieces
[1:17:48] together sword third pool I must be
[1:17:52] loyal to this message this message is
[1:17:55] the third pull at the end of the opening
[1:17:58] of the seals he says I hope you've
[1:18:00] understood
[1:18:01] it this is the third
[1:18:04] pool this what
[1:18:06] I Pentecostals all going around got a
[1:18:09] bunch of Pentecostals in the message
[1:18:10] trying to make make it
[1:18:12] a Wheelchairs and and and blind eyes and
[1:18:16] in in in the in the little you know in
[1:18:18] the little building and we want to see
[1:18:20] great manifestations well the only way
[1:18:22] you're going to see great manifestations
[1:18:24] is to take the sword of the spirit and
[1:18:26] kill your
[1:18:29] Devils sure there's going to be great
[1:18:31] gratifications of the spirit it's going
[1:18:32] to take somebody taking the sword of God
[1:18:35] and saying I'm not letting you come any
[1:18:36] further I am tired of it I am sick of it
[1:18:40] you are
[1:18:45] defeated but it ain't a bunch of people

[1:18:50] prophesy and trying to run all over the
[1:18:51] building and trying to manufacture
[1:18:53] something no it's going to take a people
[1:18:56] who know their position and they believe
[1:18:59] that word with everything they've
[1:19:04] got then sickness sickness is not going
[1:19:08] to hold on them on anymore the Mind

[1:36:17] cry's our our
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:33] you know
[1:36:35] I my message sort
[1:36:37] of took a turn from what I
[1:36:44] was the way that I thought that it would
[1:36:46] go
[1:36:48] but let me just give you the essence of
[1:36:50] what I was wanting to get to
[1:36:53] the word that you're
[1:36:55] believing the brandom says the water
[1:36:57] falls upon the
[1:36:59] non-elect like water on a Ducks back as
[1:37:02] the anointing comes upon them but it it
[1:37:05] it doesn't do much to it but it says but
[1:37:07] let it once strike that seed and Watch
[1:37:10] What Happens quickly something is there
[1:37:12] right now why it's a predestinated seed
[1:37:15] that's coming forth It's got to come
[1:37:17] when that light the gospel strikes it
[1:37:20] they get it the rest of them will just
[1:37:22] walk away get up and walk away it's not
[1:37:24] for
[1:37:26] them and and so he he he talks about
[1:37:31] that but then but then he
[1:37:35] says he says now
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:47] um he says so potentially it's in there
[1:37:49] what is it it's the promised word before
[1:37:51] the foundation of the world
[1:37:54] and around there this only reflects the
[1:37:57] negative talking about the flesh that's
[1:37:59] that's what that will reflect the
[1:38:01] positive the word the translation of the
[1:38:03] Bride will be the same thing the word
[1:38:05] that's in you the body will materialize
[1:38:09] around that word the same thing did by
[1:38:15] Sarah when that old body that she had
[1:38:18] that first body had to be changed in
[1:38:20] order to produce a son and that body
[1:38:23] could could not do it this body cannot
[1:38:24] do it so it'll have to be changed the
[1:38:26] same way to receive the sun now he's
[1:38:29] saying that that word that you're
[1:38:30] receiving in your heart that that word
[1:38:32] that you're allowing the Holy Ghost to
[1:38:33] fall upon he says that new body is being
[1:38:37] formed around that word and when this
[1:38:40] body drops off that body will all will
[1:38:44] be all that is
[1:38:47] seen
[1:38:50] this this thing here
[1:38:53] will be laid aside but that word that
[1:38:57] new body will just be right around that
[1:38:59] nucleus that predestinated
[1:39:02] seed I thought that was
[1:39:05] beautiful
[1:39:07] confirming what you were at the very
[1:39:10] beginning the
[1:39:12] Rapture the Rapture then would truly
[1:39:15] confirm what you have been saying by
[1:39:18] faith all along you have been saying by
[1:39:21] faith I'm a Believer you have been been
[1:39:23] saying by faith and the devil has been
[1:39:25] right there the whole time battling you
[1:39:27] with sickness battling you with
[1:39:29] depression battling you there with but
[1:39:32] the Rapture will be the final
[1:39:36] confirmation it'll be the finally final
[1:39:38] declaration to Satan and all of his imps
[1:39:42] the seed was there all along you love
[1:39:45] that it was there all along God bless
[1:39:49] you now it's it's the Rapture ain't just
[1:39:53] you I mean you don't don't be waiting
[1:39:54] for the Rapture to have a confirmation
[1:39:56] but it'll be you it'll be a confirmation
[1:39:59] to the world to the devil to everyone
[1:40:01] else what you have been what you have
[1:40:04] been standing in faith on all along
[1:40:07] amen hallelujah I love it this whole
[1:40:11] body will give way and that new one will
[1:40:13] come God bless you amen love every one
