[25:49] We'll try this. Just help me sing it. I
[25:51] left a barren land
[25:55] searching [music] for rest.
[25:58] Stumbling round in [singing] amnesia.
[26:03] Bitterness and distress. But then I felt
[26:08] my redeemer
[26:10] who's called mighty one. He took this
[26:15] old [music]
[26:15] moabitete from the field and brought me
[26:19] to his house.
[26:22] [music]
[26:23] He said, "Fear not, my child, [singing]
[26:28] for you are part [music] of me, and I'll
[26:32] not rest.
[26:34] You are at my side.
[26:39] I will do [singing and music] all that
[26:41] you
[26:44] ask [music] of me. You're a jewel
[26:47] [singing] in her eyes,
[26:50] virtuous woman. And you are my bride
[26:55] [singing]
[26:57] and I responded to your call
[27:02] and you [singing] have covered me.
[27:05] Lord, with eyes of faith [music] I've
[27:08] seen.
[27:09] All the mysteries being revealed and now
[27:13] I see who I am.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; And I lay claim to all that's mine.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[27:20] &gt;&gt; I'm the lamb's wife.
[27:24] I was bought with the price.
[27:29] He [singing and music]
[27:29] said, "Fear not my child, for [singing]
[27:34] you [music] are part of me and I'll not
[27:38] rest
[27:40] till you are at my [music] side.
[27:44] I will do all that you
[27:49] ask of me [music]
[27:51] through a jewel [singing] in our eyes.
[27:55] Virtuous
[27:56] woman, [music]
[27:58] you are my bride. [singing]
[28:01] When I look back and see. And when I
[28:04] look back [music]
[28:05] and see, oh my, all the things,
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, it brings me to [music] my knees
[28:13] [singing]
[28:14] that you would even think about me when
[28:18] I'm in need. You're still Jehovah Gyra.
[28:22] You're [music] still [singing] the great
[28:23] healer.
[28:25] With faith I'll stand on your word cuz
[28:29] you're more than able.
[28:33] Ye [music and singing] said, "Fear not,
[28:36] my child for you are [music and singing]
[28:40] part of me and thou not rest
[28:44] [music] till you are at my side.
[28:49] I will do all that you [singing]
[28:54] ask of [music] me. You're a jewel in my
[28:58] eyes.
[28:59] Virtuous woman.
[29:02] You are my [singing and music] bride.
[29:05] Help me sing it now. And so I'm casting
[29:09] all my cares [music] on you.

[29:51] no longer dead. He's risen
[29:56] and he's coming back [music] for you and
[29:59] me. One more time. And so I'm casting

[39:48] [applause and music]
[39:49] What does this mean to you?
[39:52] Should be mean more than life. It is
[39:55] life. He came to give us life cuz we
[39:59] were dead in our sins.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad
[40:05] as Revelation 10:1 says, "I saw another
[40:08] mighty angel come down from heaven
[40:10] clothed in a cloud and a rainbow upon
[40:12] his head. His face was worth the sun and
[40:16] his feet as pillars of fire. And he had
[40:18] in his hand a little book
[40:21] &gt;&gt; open,
[40:22] &gt;&gt; not closed.
[40:26] And he put his right foot upon the land
[40:28] and his left foot on the sea earth on
[40:31] right on the sea and the left on the
[40:32] earth cried with a loud voice as when a
[40:35] lion roar. And when he cried, seven
[40:37] thunders uttered their voices.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders uttered
[40:43] their voices, I was about to write and I
[40:45] heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal
[40:46] up those things which the seven thunders
[40:48] uttered and write THEM NOT. DON'T WRITE
[40:50] them
[40:52] at that time." And the angel which I
[40:55] said saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[40:57] earth lifted up his hand to heaven.
[40:58] Swear by him that liveth forever and
[41:00] ever. Created heavens and the things are
[41:01] there in the earth and things are
[41:03] therein are and the sea and all the
[41:04] things were therein. There should be
[41:06] time no longer.
[41:08] But in the days of the voice of the
[41:11] seventh angel,
[41:13] &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound, all the
[41:16] mysteries
[41:18] should be of God should be finished as
[41:21] he hath DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS THE
[41:24] PROPHETS. [laughter]
[41:25] OH, I'M SO GLAD I SAW HIM. I SAW THAT
[41:28] REVEALED in my day. I can't deny it.
[41:33] It's more than life to me, friends. As a
[41:36] 17-year-old boy, God opened up started
[41:39] open up these mysteries to me.
[41:42] I couldn't stay [music] where I was at.
[41:46] Amen. I had to come up higher. Amen. If
[41:49] if my friends and my girlfriend didn't
[41:51] want to go and her parents didn't want
[41:53] to [music] go, I had to go. I got to go.
[41:56] I got to make that rapture. Friends,
[41:58] what does it [music] mean to you this
[42:00] morning? Is it more than life to you? If
[42:03] it's not, you don't have that
[42:05] revelation, you can have it this
[42:06] morning. Just ask to God and he'll give
[42:09] it to you. Amen. God bless you as you're
[42:12] standing to your feet. Amen. Let's sing
[42:14] the song. It's on my heart. I want you
[42:17] to sing it with all your heart. How

[42:38] on until the coming of the Lord. Amen.

[43:29] thunder.

[44:47] And when I think

[45:01] sent him to die.
[45:06] Oh my heart scarce can take it in it in.

[51:59] an anointed bride here on the earth. And
[52:03] I I I want if the Lord would help me to
[52:07] um
[52:08] uh to just speak a little bit on the
[52:11] mystery of the church.
[52:15] And um but here in Revelations 1 and10,
[52:19] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[52:23] and heard behind me a great voice of a
[52:25] trumpet saying, "I am Alpha and Omega,
[52:30] the first and the last.
[52:33] what thou seeest write in a book and
[52:35] send it unto the seven churches which
[52:38] are in Asia, unto Ephesus, Smyrna,
[52:41] Pergamus, Thitara,
[52:44] Sardis, Philadelphia,
[52:46] and unto Leodysia.
[52:49] And then I turned to see the voice that
[52:51] spake unto me, and being turned, I saw
[52:54] seven golden candlesticks.
[52:57] And in the midst of the seven
[52:59] candlesticks, one like unto the Son of
[53:01] Man, clothed with a garment down to the
[53:04] foot, gird about the paps with a golden
[53:08] girdle. We understand this is this is
[53:11] Christ.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Alpha, the Omega. His head and
[53:16] his hair were white like wool, as white
[53:18] as snow. His eyes were as the flame of
[53:21] fire. his feet like unto fine brass as
[53:25] they did as they burned in a furnace,
[53:27] and his voice as the sound of many
[53:29] waters. And he had in his right hand
[53:33] seven stars, and out of his mouth went a
[53:37] sharp two-edged sword, and his
[53:39] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[53:42] his strength. And when I saw him, I fell
[53:45] at his feet as dead. and he laid his
[53:48] right hand upon me, saying unto me,
[53:50] "Fear not, for I am the first and the
[53:54] last. I am he that liveth, was dead, and
[53:58] behold, I'm alive forever more." Amen.
[54:02] And have the keys of hell and of death.
[54:05] Write the things which thou hast seen,
[54:09] and the things which are, and the things
[54:12] which shall be hereafter, the mystery of
[54:15] the seven stars, which thou sawest in my
[54:17] right hand, and the seven golden
[54:20] candlesticks, the seven stars are the
[54:23] seven angels of the seven churches, and
[54:26] the seven candlesticks
[54:28] which thou sawest are the seven
[54:31] churches. Now, why don't we just go to
[54:33] the Lord in prayer? Father, we want to
[54:36] thank you. Thank you for your presence
[54:38] that we feel here today. Your your love
[54:42] to us and your blessings, the anointing,
[54:45] Lord, that that is present upon your
[54:48] word and upon your people.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Father, we never want to do anything to
[54:54] spurn that love and your kindness to us.
[54:59] We ask that you would forgive us of our
[55:01] sins, Lord. Lord, purify our hearts and
[55:05] our minds. And may we always, Lord, walk
[55:10] worthily, Lord, of your love to us. And
[55:14] Father, we just ask that you would be
[55:16] here with us this morning, that you
[55:18] would speak the words of life to us. And
[55:22] Father, we'll give you glory and honor
[55:25] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:28] Can the church say amen?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[55:33] seated here this morning.
[55:37] We want to
[55:40] uh look here this this morning and I I
[55:44] think I want us to uh I want to really
[55:48] um
[55:50] if the the
[55:53] thoughts of my heart is to really shine
[55:56] uh a light upon upon God's uh God's body
[56:02] here on the earth. And um we've sort of
[56:05] gone through Christmas and and and and
[56:07] in my way um of of talking how that man
[56:12] it was God in Christ then it was God in
[56:15] his bride. And it's important that we
[56:19] understand that because we're not a
[56:20] defeated people. Um we are a people with
[56:24] uh extreme purpose
[56:27] and and this this purpose we don't
[56:30] command God to do anything. I cannot
[56:33] command God to um to to heal. I cannot
[56:37] command God to u do anything. He he is
[56:41] not he he is not a servant of mine. I am
[56:45] his servant.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I can't I can't make uh uh
[56:51] God do anything. But what I but what I
[56:54] can do is believe what's in his word.
[56:57] Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And when his word says that I can have
[57:00] it, then I come with faith expecting to
[57:04] receive it. So we're not demanding God
[57:07] or commanding things of God. We are
[57:10] Amen. We are understanding
[57:13] that we are his his vessels. Just as
[57:17] Jesus said, "My meat is to do the will
[57:20] of him that sent me. My desire is to
[57:24] please him."
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so um uh as as as the
[57:29] father gives me that I do. And so this
[57:34] is uh so I I want us to to to look as we
[57:39] look at some of these look at these
[57:40] symbols here this morning. And and just
[57:44] uh uh you know, first of all, when you
[57:47] look there at John the Revelator, Amen.
[57:49] he was a word prophet. And so, uh, a a
[57:53] word prophet is one that God comes to
[57:57] and and he reveals himself to. Amen. So,
[58:02] a a word prophet is not the same as a
[58:05] five-fold ministry prophet. Now, a a
[58:08] five-fold ministry prophet or a or
[58:11] [clears throat] even a gift of prophecy.
[58:13] You can you've got the the the word of
[58:16] knowledge. You've got the word of faith.
[58:17] You've got uh uh you you've got these
[58:20] gifts that are given to us. And we're
[58:22] and we're thankful for those gifts.
[58:24] Amen. And and we're thankful for the
[58:26] five-fold ministry.
[58:28] In the five-fold ministry, there's going
[58:30] to be the the the uh the prophet, uh the
[58:34] the pastor, the evangelist, the apostle,
[58:37] and the teacher. And and these are these
[58:40] are gifts to the church. But when God is
[58:43] going to speak and reveal uh his his
[58:48] hidden mysteries
[58:50] that God will raise up a prophet. He's a
[58:54] word prophet that will come. The Bible
[58:57] was written by prophets. So as a as the
[59:01] five-fold ministry, Amen. I have to take
[59:04] the words of the book. Amen. And and
[59:07] line everything that I believe up to
[59:10] that. But if I don't have the
[59:12] revelation, if the revelation for the
[59:15] age has not been given, then I can only
[59:19] see as I can see. And so I have to line
[59:22] it up with what what the revelation is
[59:25] that God has given me. And I think
[59:26] that's required of all of us.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but God sends the prophets to
[59:32] look be above and beyond and and begin
[59:36] to Amen. Uh that's how Jesus was
[59:39] foretold. His coming was foretold 800
[59:42] years before. That's how that's that's
[59:45] how a lot of these prophecies were given
[59:48] and then later on were fulfilled. Well,
[59:51] the book of Revelation is is prophetic
[59:55] of the church. Amen. So there it's
[59:59] prophetic of what God was going to do in
[1:00:02] the church.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; now, first of all, John the Revelator,
[1:00:06] Amen. the Lord would raise him up. Now
[1:00:08] it, you know, John must have u must have
[1:00:12] felt really lonely as as he was as he
[1:00:16] was exiled to the aisle of Patmas, a
[1:00:19] small uh island on the Asian Sea. And
[1:00:23] you know, which is 30 miles off the
[1:00:24] coast of Asia Minor. And and this this
[1:00:27] island was a lot like Alcatraz.
[1:00:30] uh you know where where the uh this this
[1:00:34] is the place that the that um uh the the
[1:00:37] Roman emperor put the hardened criminals
[1:00:41] and and so this was an island out there
[1:00:43] was very rocky. It was full of deadly
[1:00:45] snakes, scorpions, lizards. Uh this is
[1:00:49] where this vision this is where the book
[1:00:52] of Revelations was was uh written from
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; and and it was IT WAS A PROPHET AMEN.
[1:01:01] THAT THAT WAS TREATED LIKE A CRIMINAL.
[1:01:03] NOW, he was not A CRIMINAL. HE WAS A
[1:01:06] SPIRITUAL MAN. He he he was a prophet
[1:01:09] and and SO HE WAS A godly man. He wasn't
[1:01:11] a troublemaker. He wasn't uh you know,
[1:01:14] one that was that was going around
[1:01:16] vandalizing. He had very good character.
[1:01:19] Amen. He had a GOOD REPUTATION. THE THE
[1:01:22] PROBLEM was they they called him a
[1:01:24] witch. Yeah. They they thought that he
[1:01:27] was a witch and they were trying to kill
[1:01:29] him.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And so, FIRST OF ALL, THEY THEY BOILED
[1:01:34] HIM. They Amen. They had him in a vat of
[1:01:37] grease for 24 hours trying to uh boil
[1:01:42] the the Apostle John, the prophet John.
[1:01:46] And uh Amen. BUT HE SURVIVED IT. HE he
[1:01:50] actually survived with absolutely no
[1:01:53] harm. and and and they and then they
[1:01:56] were really upset because they said he
[1:01:58] bewitched the Greece and Amen. Well,
[1:02:01] praise the Lord. God knows how to take
[1:02:02] care of his own. Is that right?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; But here's the real reason for his
[1:02:06] misfortune. The real reason is God WAS
[1:02:10] GOING GOD WAS GOING TO HAVE HIM EXILED
[1:02:14] SO THAT GOD WOULD HAVE HIM ALONE AND so
[1:02:17] that he could hear from God and get the
[1:02:20] revelation. Well, bless the name of the
[1:02:22] Lord. And and so uh we when you and and
[1:02:25] actually when you read there in in
[1:02:27] Revelations 1:9, it says, "I John, who
[1:02:30] also am your brother and companion in
[1:02:33] tribulation and in the kingdom and
[1:02:35] patience of Jesus Christ, was on the
[1:02:38] aisle that is called Patmas for the word
[1:02:41] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[1:02:45] Christ." And I was in the spirit on the
[1:02:50] Lord's day. So, it wasn't a a a a
[1:02:53] certain day of the week. IT WAS GOD
[1:02:57] SHOWING HIM THE FUTURE. GOD working in
[1:03:01] his church. Well, glory to God.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT TO TELL you the reason for
[1:03:07] Jesus coming was so that he would have a
[1:03:11] redeemed on the earth that he would work
[1:03:14] through.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we're Aren't you Aren't you
[1:03:18] thankful that God's got a divine purpose
[1:03:20] for your life? Amen. That's right. And
[1:03:23] so John wrote the book of Revelations in
[1:03:27] in symbols. Everything about the book
[1:03:29] was symbolic. Amen. you everything John
[1:03:33] John and and but I I I like this you
[1:03:35] know as as you as you look through the
[1:03:37] book of revelations you will find that
[1:03:40] the symbols that are used are all found
[1:03:43] rich literally in the old testament so a
[1:03:47] lot of these symbols that we read in the
[1:03:49] book of revelation is also found uh a
[1:03:53] lot of them uh is found there in the
[1:03:55] book of Daniel AND SO AS AS WE GO
[1:03:58] THROUGH THIS THIS MORNING I I want you
[1:04:00] to really see the picture that God is is
[1:04:04] wanting to put. Amen. In there, have you
[1:04:07] have you ever thought about uh um Amen.
[1:04:10] why the there had to be a lamb used in
[1:04:13] the Old Testament? Have you ever thought
[1:04:15] about why uh uh there was a tabernacle
[1:04:18] in the Old Testament? Have you ever
[1:04:20] thought about why there were the seven
[1:04:22] candlesticks in the Old Testament? Uh
[1:04:24] the ark of the covenant in the Old
[1:04:26] Testament? These were types of that
[1:04:29] which was coming today. That you were
[1:04:32] going to be the tabernacle of the Lord.
[1:04:35] Amen. THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS WAS going
[1:04:37] to redeem you to himself. And so once
[1:04:41] again, I I I I think it's I think it's
[1:04:44] very uh imperative that we that we take
[1:04:47] this and brother Merl uh quoted that
[1:04:49] quote this morning at the at the
[1:04:51] sounding of the seventh angel, the
[1:04:55] mystery. Now, brother brother uh uh he
[1:04:58] he didn't mean to do it. I'm I'm sure he
[1:05:00] said the mysteries of God. That's not
[1:05:03] the way the Bible said the mystery
[1:05:06] singular shall or should be finished. So
[1:05:11] So it's not it's not mysteries.
[1:05:14] It's one mystery. THEY'RE THEY'RE
[1:05:17] THEY'RE ALL THE PUZZLES, ALL THE PIECES
[1:05:20] OF THE PUZZLE OF ALL THE PROPHETS ARE
[1:05:23] ALL COMING TOGETHER IN ONE MYSTERY. And
[1:05:26] that is
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; that is you. That's the church. God in
[1:05:34] his church. [cheering]
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:05:39] SO, THE mystery of God should be
[1:05:42] finished. You are that mystery. Well, I
[1:05:46] want you to look to your neighbor and
[1:05:47] say, "Amen. Uh, I glad to know your
[1:05:51] mystery." Amen. So, so as we look in
[1:05:54] this it in in this again, it has been
[1:05:58] kept uh silent till the last age. Amen.
[1:06:02] These two years of 2,000 years of
[1:06:05] mystery, it is the mysterious work of
[1:06:08] redemption. Amen. And and it would be uh
[1:06:13] the total of all the symbols. When I
[1:06:15] talk about the symbols in in the book of
[1:06:17] revelations there even the ages were in
[1:06:20] symbols. The seven candlesticks, the
[1:06:22] seven stars in the right hand and the
[1:06:25] the great the four horse riders,
[1:06:28] the four living creatures before the
[1:06:30] throne, the great dragon, the beast
[1:06:32] coming out of the waters, the beast
[1:06:34] coming OUT OF THE LAND. ALL OF THESE
[1:06:36] things here, amen, were the SYMBOLS THAT
[1:06:40] WERE PUT and the and and and you and you
[1:06:42] ask why were they put in symbols? WELL,
[1:06:45] ACCORDING TO THE THE THE 10TH CHAPTER IS
[1:06:48] THE SYMBOLS WERE TO BE KEPT SECRET UNTIL
[1:06:52] THE SEVENTH church age. AMEN. SO THAT
[1:06:56] WHAT WHOEVER THAT SEVENTH uh angel is,
[1:07:00] then he will sound the mysteries. Amen.
[1:07:04] and he will will begin to reveal uh uh
[1:07:08] God would reveal God's great mystery.
[1:07:11] But until then, they were all in simple
[1:07:13] form. Praise the Lord. And I I'll tell
[1:07:16] you, I just put it out here just real
[1:07:18] real plainly. God, these guys, Apostle
[1:07:21] Paul, died believing that that Jesus was
[1:07:25] coming real soon.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Every one of those 12 apostles died
[1:07:29] believing that Jesus was coming real
[1:07:31] soon. Amen. ALL THROUGH THE AGES,
[1:07:34] EVERYONE HAS DIED believing he's coming
[1:07:36] soon. He's coming soon. If they WOULD
[1:07:39] HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A
[1:07:41] 2,000-year period, WELL, THEY THEY THEY
[1:07:44] WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES. Maybe
[1:07:46] maybe they wouldn't have been as uh uh
[1:07:49] you know, as diligent. They they they
[1:07:51] would have left IT FOR WHATEVER. BUT GOD
[1:07:53] WAS GOING TO HAVE A witness throughout
[1:07:57] Amen. THIS THESE LAST 2,000 UH YEARS of
[1:08:00] church history. But the scripture says
[1:08:04] in this day the mystery shall be
[1:08:09] finished.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Well, somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. SO, so it is
[1:08:18] the mystery of the bride of Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ. Amen. She's lived her mystery
[1:08:25] out through these Amen. Uh through those
[1:08:28] seven churches. Amen. And so as we as we
[1:08:33] go through here this morning, I I I WANT
[1:08:35] US TO JUST ju just just just go through
[1:08:38] um some of the basics here and and let's
[1:08:40] just talk about these seven
[1:08:42] candlesticks.
[1:08:44] CHRIST WALKING in the midst of THE
[1:08:48] CANDLESTICKS
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID THE CANDLESTICKS is the
[1:08:52] mystery of THE CHURCH. SO THESE SEVEN
[1:08:55] CANDLESTICKS WOULD END UP BEING seven
[1:08:59] periods of time throughout church
[1:09:01] history. You would start with the first
[1:09:04] church age. They're in Ephesus and then
[1:09:06] IT WOULD GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. THESE ARE
[1:09:09] periods throughout the church history.
[1:09:12] And each one of these periods THERE IS A
[1:09:16] PROPHECY given to to to that church. And
[1:09:20] you would be able to look at that
[1:09:22] church. If you take for instance uh uh
[1:09:24] when in the dark age when when the uh
[1:09:27] Catholic church took over. Amen. The
[1:09:30] scripture says it right there uh right
[1:09:32] there in that third church age when when
[1:09:34] it would start coming in and and then
[1:09:36] they would start uh uh you know selling
[1:09:39] selling uh uh uh um you know uh um what
[1:09:43] do you call those novenas or uh you know
[1:09:46] selling things for for money and and
[1:09:49] selling blessings and well it's in the
[1:09:51] scripture.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; It's in THE SCRIPTURE AND THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:09:55] THAT THEY WOULD THEY would weigh out for
[1:09:57] a balance and they would do this. IT
[1:09:59] SAYS THAT THAT WOMAN JEZEBEL, WHICH WAS
[1:10:02] NONE other than THAT GREAT THE
[1:10:04] CATHOLIC CHURCH, AMEN, started to COMMIT
[1:10:07] AND TEACHING GOD'S SERVANTS TO EAT
[1:10:10] THINGS SACRIFICED TO IDOLS.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S ALL IN THE SCRIPTURE. SO,
[1:10:16] SO AS WE GO THROUGH HERE, AMEN. EVEN
[1:10:19] THROUGHOUT THE CHURCH HISTORY, THUH
[1:10:23] THOUGH PAGAN UH THOUGH THE CHURCH WENT
[1:10:27] OFF IN in way off, God always had a
[1:10:32] bride in each one of those ages. HE'S
[1:10:35] ALWAYS HAD A people that he's got his
[1:10:38] hands upon.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. SO, SO HE SAYS,
[1:10:43] "I SAW SEVEN CANDLES, GOLDEN
[1:10:45] CANDLESTICKS, and and and I've seen the
[1:10:48] the the the mighty one, the great one. I
[1:10:51] seen the son of man walking throughout
[1:10:53] those candlesticks." BUT THEN HE SAYS,
[1:10:56] "THOSE SEVEN UH THE THE SEVEN STARS
[1:10:59] WHICH YOU SAW SAW ARE the seven angels
[1:11:02] to the seven churches." And then there
[1:11:04] are the seven candlesticks which are the
[1:11:08] churches themselves.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we we want to we we want to
[1:11:13] SEE THIS BECAUSE THE WHOLE of the entire
[1:11:16] age is given in these seven distinct
[1:11:20] periods of time. Amen. There was
[1:11:23] Ephesus. There was Samrna. There was
[1:11:26] Pergamus, Thyron, Sardis, Philadelphia,
[1:11:30] and Leoa. And we're living in that last
[1:11:33] age. We're living in that last period of
[1:11:36] time, the Leoysian CHURCH. YOU SAY,
[1:11:38] "NOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE LIVING
[1:11:40] in the in the last age?" Well, the Bible
[1:11:43] said, "Amen." Well, he didn't have too
[1:11:45] much good to say about the this church
[1:11:47] age at all, did he? Amen. He says, He
[1:11:49] says, "You're rich increase with goods
[1:11:53] and say you have need of nothing." Amen.
[1:11:56] He says, "I I say to you, Amen. Uh uh
[1:12:00] you're you're blind, you're wretched,
[1:12:02] you're miserable, and you don't know it.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; You're deceived." Is that right? AND
[1:12:07] THAT CHRIST, IT WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST
[1:12:09] TIME that Christ would be on the outside
[1:12:12] of his church.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I say we're living in that day today.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh so we we look at those at
[1:12:23] at this at [snorts] these periods. Each
[1:12:26] age carried a certain characteristic.
[1:12:29] Amen. And this would be a direct
[1:12:32] prophecy to each age. Amen. each period
[1:12:35] of time and it foretells the spirit that
[1:12:40] would be behind the age. There was going
[1:12:42] to be THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST AND THERE WAS
[1:12:45] GOING TO be the spirit of the
[1:12:46] antichrist. There was going TO BE THE
[1:12:49] BRIDE OF Jesus and there was also going
[1:12:52] to be the great and her daughters
[1:12:55] the harlots.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible says this woman was going to
[1:12:59] be the mother of harlots. SO THERE'S AND
[1:13:02] EVERY ONE of them are going. These are
[1:13:05] churches.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:13:09] WORLD. We're talking about churches. So
[1:13:11] there is going to be a spiritual church
[1:13:14] who IS IN LOVE WITH HER GOD AND IS NOT
[1:13:16] GOING TO COMMIT ADULTERY ON HIM. IS
[1:13:19] GOING TO TRADE TRUE TO HIS WORD. AND
[1:13:21] THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE ANOTHER WOMAN,
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; A CHURCH,
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; USING THE same name.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but they're going to be
[1:13:32] committing adultery against the one that
[1:13:36] they claim
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; is her husband.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; So Jesus even put it out there. Amen. In
[1:13:44] that and he and he and he talked about
[1:13:46] he talked about the parable of of the
[1:13:49] good the good man coming in and sewing
[1:13:51] the sewing the good seed. And then at
[1:13:54] night here comes the the evil man with
[1:13:56] the dark uh uh coat. He's coming in and
[1:13:59] he's sewing seeds. And then and then
[1:14:02] when the when the when the uh when they
[1:14:04] found out what happened, they come to
[1:14:06] the goodman of the house and said, "Hey,
[1:14:08] the uh there there was a bad guy come in
[1:14:11] and sewed seeds in the same field that
[1:14:14] you're in." And what did he say? He
[1:14:16] said, "Let him alone, lest while
[1:14:19] plucking up the bad seed, you also pluck
[1:14:23] up the good seed." He says, "LET THEM
[1:14:25] GROW IN THE SAME FIELD, AND AT HARVEST
[1:14:28] time we will know what is uh what is
[1:14:32] good and what is evil."
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; THEY SAID, "WELL, WHAT WHAT DOES THIS
[1:14:36] PARABLE MEAN?" He says, "THE FIELD IS
[1:14:40] THE WORLD."
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; The good swer is the son of man
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; sowing good seed.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; The evil one, the the other one is the
[1:14:49] evil seowing evil seed. There's going to
[1:14:52] be tears. There's going to be wheat. But
[1:14:56] at the end, when it's harvest season,
[1:14:59] AMEN. THEN THEY WILL HARVEST THE TEARS,
[1:15:02] BIND THEM UP FOR BURNING, and they'll
[1:15:04] take the wheat into the garden.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, that's where we're at.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; We are at the reaping season. WE ARE AT.
[1:15:14] SO THE SEEDS THAT WE SAW IN THE BOOK OF
[1:15:17] REVELATION AND WE SAW THE SEEDS OF OF
[1:15:21] down through these ages when you re when
[1:15:22] you go home just begin to read through
[1:15:24] those through those uh uh revelations 2
[1:15:27] THE SECOND CHAPTER and revelations the
[1:15:29] third chapter and and you will see those
[1:15:31] periods and you'll see THE SEEDS THAT
[1:15:35] SATAN WAS SEWING EVER SO EVER SO
[1:15:39] SLIGHTLY. THEY WERE LITTLE SEEDS
[1:15:42] contrary to the word of God. THEY WERE
[1:15:44] SEEDS OF DOUBT and unbelief. And
[1:15:47] brother, if there's anything we need to
[1:15:49] be CAREFUL FOR IS WATCH THOSE LITTLE
[1:15:51] THOUGHTS, WATCH the seeds THAT COMES
[1:15:53] FROM ANYBODY AROUND YOU THAT'LL POINT UH
[1:15:56] THAT THAT'LL THAT'LL THAT'LL CAUSE YOU
[1:15:58] TO DOUBT GOD'S WORD IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; GOD'S WORD must be our absolute.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE AMEN. WHETHER I UNDERSTAND
[1:16:09] IT, whether I don't UNDERSTAND IT, IF
[1:16:11] GOD'S WORD SAYS IT, I believe it.
[1:16:14] [applause and cheering]
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO, THE FALSE VINE IS
[1:16:20] GOING TO BE GROWING AT THE SAME time as
[1:16:23] the good vine.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; So, there's going to be two anointings.
[1:16:27] There's going to be the anointing of the
[1:16:28] antichrist, antirist, anti- word, and
[1:16:32] there's going to be the anoint of the
[1:16:35] genuine Christ.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But Christ is going to
[1:16:40] be in that church in those seven
[1:16:43] candlesticks. I before I again I want to
[1:16:45] go back through it.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Christ never left the candlesticks.
[1:16:49] He was walking through the seven
[1:16:51] churches the whole time.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; And Christ will never leave you.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; As long as you're staying true to that
[1:17:02] word, I promise you he'll never leave
[1:17:04] you. Amen. [snorts] So,
[1:17:07] so he's the alpha and he's the omega.
[1:17:09] He's the God of the first church. He's
[1:17:11] the God of the last church. He's the one
[1:17:13] who started. He's the one that'll
[1:17:15] finish. He is before all times. He'll be
[1:17:18] after all times. Can you say amen? So,
[1:17:21] so we He started the church and God is
[1:17:24] very able to keep the church to complete
[1:17:29] his church. And this is the THIS IS THE
[1:17:32] GLORIOUS mystery because you as humans
[1:17:36] are GOING TO BE FULL OF FAULTS
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF
[1:17:40] FAILURES AND FAULTS THROUGHOUT THE
[1:17:41] CHURCH HISTORY. But the thing is you are
[1:17:45] redeemed by the Lord.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD LOOKS AT YOU, HE'S LOOKING
[1:17:52] AT YOU THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:17:54] CHRIST.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; He's looking at you through the blood of
[1:17:57] Jesus Christ. AMEN. AND AND AND IF YOU
[1:18:00] WERE TO LOOK THERE AT AT HEBREWS 10 and
[1:18:02] and um uh uh let's see um uh 10 and and
[1:18:08] and 12. Amen. It says, "But this man,
[1:18:12] after he HAD OFFERED ONE SAC sacrifice
[1:18:15] for sins, forever sat down on the right
[1:18:19] hand of God, from henceforth expect
[1:18:22] until his enemies be made his foottool.
[1:18:24] FOR BY ONE OFFERING, SOMEBODY SAY BY ONE
[1:18:26] OFFERING.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; BY ONE OFFERING,
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; he hath perfected.
[1:18:31] SOMEONE SAY, HE HATH perfected
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Forever
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; them that are sanctified.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; So, let's just get that straight right
[1:18:42] now. You are God's creation. YOU ARE
[1:18:45] GOD'S PEOPLE. YOU ARE HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:18:50] That's why when he said golden
[1:18:52] candlesticks, gold, goldat always
[1:18:54] represented gold always represented
[1:18:57] deity.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD IS GOING TO TO GIVE AN EX
[1:19:02] AN a
[1:19:04] um A VISUAL OF HIS CHURCH, HE DIDN'T GO
[1:19:08] GO PICK UP WOOD OR SOME NASTY STUFF.
[1:19:12] AMEN. TO REPRESENT YOU. HE CHOSE
[1:19:15] [screaming] GOLD.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Praise [snorts] the Lord. Deity.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; DEITY. THERE'S GOING TO BE A CHURCH
[1:19:24] expressing [screaming]
[1:19:25] deity.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] I I feel good about right now. THAT'S
[1:19:33] WHAT HE'S WANTING TO DO. SO, THIS ONE
[1:19:35] THAT IS IN THE MIDST OF THE
[1:19:37] CANDLESTICKS, HE'S THE COVENANT GIVER.
[1:19:40] HE'S THE COVENANT KEEPER. HE IS THE
[1:19:43] GREAT I AM. [screaming]
[1:19:44] HE'S THE ONE THAT STARTED YOU. HE'S THE
[1:19:47] AUTHOR AND THE FINISHER OF YOUR FAITH.
[1:19:50] Shout
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is. He is that one. In fact,
[1:19:59] their revelations would say he is. Amen.
[1:20:01] He that sat on the throne was to look
[1:20:03] upon as jasper and sardine stone. And
[1:20:06] there was a rainbow round about the
[1:20:09] throne. Hallelujah. What What was God?
[1:20:11] He was saying, "I am the covenant giver.
[1:20:15] I am the covenant keeper.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now,
[1:20:22] so these candlesticks are actually
[1:20:24] lampstands. And I I would like for you
[1:20:26] if you if you wouldn't mind, let's let's
[1:20:28] go to uh Zechariah the 4th chapter. And
[1:20:32] um this is this here is also a prophetic
[1:20:37] of the same thing. Amen. And um but
[1:20:41] candles will eventually go out, but a
[1:20:44] but a lampstand has a lasting quality
[1:20:46] about it. And so in a you you put a
[1:20:50] candle out and and you you you you put
[1:20:54] uh you know, you light it and that
[1:20:55] candle's, you know, when it's done, it's
[1:20:57] done. Hallelujah. But but and a
[1:21:00] lampstand,
[1:21:01] it it's got oil going through it. So
[1:21:03] it's got a bowl and we're fixing to read
[1:21:05] it here. It's got a bowl and then you
[1:21:08] put the oil in it and then there's a
[1:21:10] wick. Wicks are coming through these
[1:21:12] seven these seven uh candlesticks. Amen.
[1:21:16] But what it is and they're all fed
[1:21:19] they're they're all fed by the same oil.
[1:21:22] So the light that is being lit is coming
[1:21:26] from that from that bowl. So let's read
[1:21:29] it. And the angel talked with me again
[1:21:32] uh that talked with me came again
[1:21:35] and wake me as a man that wakenth out of
[1:21:38] his sleep and said unto me, "What seeest
[1:21:41] thou?" And I said, I have looked and
[1:21:43] behold a candlestick all of gold with
[1:21:47] with a bowl up on the top of it
[1:21:50] [clears throat] and lamp and and his uh
[1:21:53] seven lamps there on and seven pipes to
[1:21:57] the the seven lamps which are on the top
[1:22:00] of it. So So if you understand he's got
[1:22:02] there's a stand, then there's the bowl
[1:22:05] and then out of the bowl comes Amen.
[1:22:08] Let's see here. Hallelujah. comes the
[1:22:11] seven uh uh lamps. I almost gave you
[1:22:14] eight. Amen. So anyways, so and he and
[1:22:17] he says uh the seven pipes to the seven
[1:22:19] lamps which on the top thereof and two
[1:22:22] olive trees by it. One come upon the
[1:22:25] right side of the bowl and the other
[1:22:27] upon the left side thereof. So I
[1:22:30] answered and spake to the angel that
[1:22:33] talked with me, What are these, my lord?
[1:22:35] And the angel that talked with me
[1:22:37] answered and said unto me, "Knowest not
[1:22:40] uh knowest thou not what these be?" And
[1:22:43] I said, "No, my lord." And he answered
[1:22:45] and said unto me, saying, "This is the
[1:22:47] word of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying,
[1:22:50] not by might, nor by power, but by my
[1:22:55] spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." Now,
[1:22:59] this is this is a prophecy that was
[1:23:00] given. And then of course then he's
[1:23:03] going to move on and talking about the
[1:23:05] the the the tabernacle uh that was
[1:23:08] fixing to be reerected. It would it
[1:23:11] would come back and and and and he would
[1:23:13] begin to talk about the natural uh the
[1:23:16] natural temple
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; and but yet there is a there is a uh uh
[1:23:23] there's a dual meaning TO THAT BECAUSE
[1:23:26] GOD WAS SHOWING SOMETHING HERE. AMEN.
[1:23:29] those olive trees on each side, th those
[1:23:31] that that olive is the olive oil. Amen.
[1:23:34] The anointing was going to be coming
[1:23:36] from the New Testament and the Old
[1:23:39] Testament together that was going to
[1:23:42] feed this lampstand. WELL, JOHN IS NOW
[1:23:46] IN THIS IN THIS VISION AND HE'S LOOKING
[1:23:49] BACK AND HE IS SEEING HE'S SEEING THIS
[1:23:54] CANDLESTICK,
[1:23:55] these lampstands
[1:23:57] JUST EXACTLY LIKE GOD had given to to th
[1:24:01] this OTHER PROPHET. AND SO GOD WAS
[1:24:04] SHOWING THIS THAT WAS GIVEN UH H BACK
[1:24:08] THERE IN ZECHARIAH IS IS NOW GOING TO BE
[1:24:13] FULFILLED in the New Testament church.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; It's going to be fulfilled in the New
[1:24:20] Testament church. Now, uh well, I I
[1:24:23] thought that I think that's just
[1:24:24] wonderful.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, THESE LAMPS ARE ALL GETTING
[1:24:28] their oil from one boat.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:32] One bow. Somebody say
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; one bow.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Seven lamps.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; So wherever the first church got his
[1:24:42] light
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; is where the last church better get his
[1:24:47] light.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. We know. We know
[1:24:51] that those olive trees WERE THE NEW
[1:24:53] TESTAMENT and the Old Testament. YOU HAD
[1:24:56] BETTER GET YOUR REVELATION FROM THAT
[1:24:59] WORD.
[1:25:01] YOU HAD BETTER GET EVERY BIT OF YOUR
[1:25:03] LIGHT FROM THUS SAITH [screaming] THE
[1:25:05] LORD. THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENT is
[1:25:08] the oil, the the anointing upon this
[1:25:12] church.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Is that right?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; So, you got seven arms coming out of
[1:25:20] this bowl, which was the reservoir that
[1:25:22] holds the oil, and then the wicks run
[1:25:25] down into this.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same oil. You say, "Why
[1:25:31] do you keep saying that?" It's the same
[1:25:34] HOLY GHOST THAT THEY GOT ON THE BOOK ON
[1:25:37] THE DAY OF PENTECOST IS THE SAME HOLY
[1:25:40] GHOST THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING
[1:25:42] TODAY.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; IT BETTER BE. WELL, PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:25:45] WELL, GOD, DON'T DO THAT KIND OF STUFF
[1:25:46] ANYMORE. THEN THEN THEN you've got your
[1:25:49] own bowl somewhere else. And you better
[1:25:51] be careful because you might be one of
[1:25:53] those harlots
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; THAT IS COMMITTING ADULTERY AGAINST THE
[1:25:59] WORD OF GOD.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE A HARLOT WITH THE
[1:26:02] WORD OF GOD. IF GOD IS MY HUSBAND, AMEN.
[1:26:05] IF I'M HIS BRIDE, THEN LET ME STAY TRUE
[1:26:09] TO THAT VOW TO HIS WORD.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Bless the name OF THE LORD. THE SAME
[1:26:17] OIL, THE SAME HOLY [screaming] GHOST. IF
[1:26:21] THEY TALKED IN tonesues in the first
[1:26:22] church age, they're talking in tonesues
[1:26:24] in the last church age. If they if they
[1:26:26] had miracles in the first CHURCH AGE,
[1:26:28] THEN THEY'VE GOT MIRACLES IN THE LAST
[1:26:30] CHURCH AGE. IF THEY BELIEVE THE WORD AND
[1:26:33] WENT TO THE GROUND, THEY GAVE THEIR
[1:26:36] LIVES FOR THIS WORD, then I believe that
[1:26:39] same anointing should be UPON EVERY ONE
[1:26:41] OF US to believe the exact same thing.
[1:26:44] Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, church. There's nothing
[1:26:47] different.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; It's the same oil. Well, praise the
[1:26:50] Lord.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; it's the original fire. Did you know?
[1:26:55] Let's Let's just Can we Can we just stop
[1:26:57] for a moment? Hallelujah. Did you h how
[1:27:00] you know THEY HAD THE SEVEN candlesticks
[1:27:03] that were also in the in the tabernacle
[1:27:06] in Moses tabernacle? Amen. They had the
[1:27:09] candlesticks.
[1:27:11] did. Praise the Lord. When God when God
[1:27:14] told them to put that to to to build the
[1:27:17] tabernacle and then tell him to put all
[1:27:19] of the all of the uh the the the vessels
[1:27:23] inside it. Amen. And and do you do you
[1:27:26] realize how they lit that first candle?
[1:27:31] Hallelujah. This is this is crazy.
[1:27:36] Because when they done it, Amen. The
[1:27:38] pillar of fire came down and consumed
[1:27:41] that first uh offering that that first
[1:27:44] sacrifice had came down and they were to
[1:27:47] take the fire that God lit himself
[1:27:53] to light the candle and they would take
[1:27:56] that first candle that was lit OFF OFF
[1:28:00] OF THE ALTAR. The
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; to me that JUST THAT JUST BLOWS MY MIND.
[1:28:06] THEY DID NOT THEY DID not come in with a
[1:28:09] big uh a lighter and and was LIGHTING
[1:28:12] THE CANDLES. IT WAS COMMANDED THAT THEY
[1:28:15] TOOK THAT FIRST CANDLE, GO TO THE TO THE
[1:28:19] GREAT FIRE THAT [screaming] GOD STARTED.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And then they would go take that one and
[1:28:25] it would light the second one. Then they
[1:28:27] would put it in its place. Take the
[1:28:28] second one, light the third one, put it
[1:28:31] in its place. Take the third one, light
[1:28:33] the fourth one, put it in its place.
[1:28:35] Take the fourth one, light. And that's
[1:28:36] and that's how they they were to go
[1:28:38] through their lid. And then it required
[1:28:41] the oil from all of them. Well, praise
[1:28:44] the Lord.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Does that does that really
[1:28:48] matter?" Yeah, it did
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; because Aaron's son just a few years
[1:28:56] later,
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Aaron's son came in with strange fire.
[1:29:01] They brought their bicks
[1:29:04] and they came in there to light the
[1:29:06] candle.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Well, we all know
[1:29:12] what happened to them. They died.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; God killed them right there.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they were offering
[1:29:18] strange fire. God don't want strange
[1:29:21] fire.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; God wants what he gave on the day of
[1:29:26] Pentecost OR HE'LL HAVE NOTHING.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:29:30] GOD WANTS WHAT THE FIRST CHURCH HAD IN
[1:29:32] THE BOOK OF ACTS. OR HE'LL HAVE NOTHING.
[1:29:35] GOD WANTS WHAT HE'S GOT IN THAT ORIGINAL
[1:29:38] CHURCH. AMEN. In the New Testament that
[1:29:40] we read or he WILL HAVE NOTHING. SOMEONE
[1:29:44] SAY YES.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; I want the anointing. THE SAME
[1:29:49] ANOINTING. NOT THE STRANGE FIRE. And
[1:29:51] boys, I want this. I don't want you.
[1:29:53] It's you. You You can't You can't be a
[1:29:55] Christian and and do things the way you
[1:29:57] want to do it.
[1:29:59] ELDERS, YOU CAN'T BE A CHRISTIAN AND DO
[1:30:01] THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK YOU need to do
[1:30:02] it. YOU'VE GOT TO use the original fire
[1:30:06] or God will not accept it.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. DO
[1:30:11] YOU LOVE HIM?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; SO, THE PRIEST WOULD TAKE THAT SACRED
[1:30:15] FIRE FROM OFF THE THAT SACRED ALTAR.
[1:30:20] AMEN. AND THAT WAS ORIGINALLY LIGHTED BY
[1:30:23] GOD. AND he would take that and that's
[1:30:26] how he would lie or or that he would
[1:30:29] Amen. Uh uh that that that's how the
[1:30:31] candlesticks were were uh done. Now
[1:30:36] I want us to look for a moment uh at at
[1:30:40] these candlesticks of of beaten gold and
[1:30:43] and because and and and we're going to
[1:30:45] be dealing with this a little bit later
[1:30:46] on too, but I I just want us to come
[1:30:48] back to the to the gold, the deity, the
[1:30:51] rarity. The gold is the rarest of all
[1:30:53] and it's and and it was created in in
[1:30:56] that. Amen. And and you say, "HOW can
[1:31:00] me, how can you as the church, how can I
[1:31:05] ever be likened unto deity?"
[1:31:09] Because Jesus plainly said, "The
[1:31:12] candlesticks
[1:31:14] represent the church." Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; And I wish we could get that in our
[1:31:19] minds
[1:31:21] THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST and his
[1:31:24] righteousness upon you,
[1:31:28] GOD can't see your sins.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; God can't see your wrongs.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; HE SHED HIS BLOOD [screaming] NOT FOR
[1:31:39] THAT ONE AND THAT ONE AND THAT. NOW,
[1:31:41] PRAISE THE LORD. He didn't shed his
[1:31:43] blood for the harlots.
[1:31:45] He shed his blood for his elect
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; because he knows that you COULDN'T DO IT
[1:31:51] WITHOUT HIM.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; He had to provide it. That's why he
[1:31:54] came. That's why deity came in a body in
[1:31:58] the first place. Can you say amen?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand that the church
[1:32:03] is made of humanity. Now I am not saying
[1:32:07] that the church DOESN'T REPENT. THE
[1:32:09] BLOOD DOES YOU NO GOOD IF YOU DON'T
[1:32:11] REPENT.
[1:32:13] That's right.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU YOU GO AROUND AND AND ACTING
[1:32:17] LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT WRONG AND
[1:32:19] YOU'RE YOU'RE AS DEAD WRONG AS DEAD
[1:32:21] WRONG CAN BE. YOUR SINS ARE NOT ATONED
[1:32:23] FOR.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; You've got to accept it.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You remember the pardon the
[1:32:32] the pardon that that Abraham Lincoln had
[1:32:34] given.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, the boy went awall and
[1:32:37] got scared and and and and and so he ran
[1:32:40] away and and uh Amen. And they, you
[1:32:43] know, they found him and they was going
[1:32:44] to hang him or no, they was going to I
[1:32:46] think it was in is in President
[1:32:48] Lincoln's day, so that's probably going
[1:32:50] to uh go go before a firing squad. And
[1:32:53] and so uh the mother had been been just
[1:32:57] trying everything. She couldn't finally,
[1:32:59] you know, she had been looking for uh
[1:33:00] Lincoln and he knew that she knew that
[1:33:02] he was going to be at a certain
[1:33:03] function. And so she finally got up to
[1:33:05] him and she said, "Please, sir, please.
[1:33:07] My son is going to be killed tomorrow.
[1:33:10] He's a good boy. He's a good boy. He He
[1:33:14] didn't He loves his country, but he got
[1:33:16] scared and he ran off and and Lincoln
[1:33:19] listened to this mother and and he took
[1:33:21] his pen, took took an old envelope and
[1:33:24] AND HE WROTE PARDON ON IT AND SIGNED HIS
[1:33:27] NAME."
[1:33:28] SHE RUNS [screaming] BACK, GOES TO THE
[1:33:30] JAIL AND AND GIVES IT TO THE OFFICER
[1:33:33] SAYS, "THIS IS BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN."
[1:33:35] THEY HAND IT TO THE BOY. AND THE BOY
[1:33:37] LOOKS AT IT WAS A BROKEN. It was just a
[1:33:39] It was just an old torn off piece of an
[1:33:41] envelope. And and and the and and and
[1:33:44] the boy looked at it and he said,
[1:33:49] "If this come from the president, it
[1:33:51] would have seal.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; You guys are making fun of me.
[1:33:57] YOU'RE MOCKING ME.
[1:34:00] THEY WERE SAYING YOUR MOTHER GOT THIS
[1:34:02] FROM HIM YESTERDAY.
[1:34:06] IT'S A FULL PARDON.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; WELL, he refused. They hung him.
[1:34:14] So then they now was a court case and
[1:34:17] they went to court. They went through it
[1:34:19] through all the deal and the verdict was
[1:34:20] this. A pardon is only a pardon if it's
[1:34:26] accepted
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; as a pardon.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; I I I I know it wasn't an angel coming
[1:34:36] down from heaven that it it was a it was
[1:34:38] a human being with beard ripped out of
[1:34:41] his of and he was and he was bloody and
[1:34:43] he was unrecognizable and he was hung up
[1:34:46] there with with all of the other with
[1:34:48] with the OTHER TWO CRIMINALS. BUT I WANT
[1:34:50] TO TELL YOU THAT WAS GOD'S ENVELOPE TO
[1:34:53] YOU. THAT THAT WAS JUST A COMMON MAN. IT
[1:34:56] WAS A COMMON MAN. THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT
[1:34:58] WAS WRITING, [screaming] "I FORGIVE YOU.
[1:35:01] YOU ARE PARDONED. YOU ARE FREE." AND LET
[1:35:04] ME JUST SAY THIS TO THE CHURCH. AMEN. IN
[1:35:07] THESE CHURCH AGES, AMEN. GOD'S GOT A
[1:35:10] BRIDE AGAIN. WHY WOULD GOD HAVE THE
[1:35:13] HARLOT AND THEN GOD WOULD HAVE HIS
[1:35:15] LITTLE BRIDE? WHY WOULD GOD MAKE THE
[1:35:17] DISTINCTION? THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE
[1:35:19] THAT IS GOING TO BELIEVE HIS WORD.
[1:35:21] THEY'RE GOING TO STAND UPON HIS WORD AND
[1:35:23] THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE God's
[1:35:24] righteousness in their lives.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE GOD'S
[1:35:28] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; MAN, [snorts] that just makes me that
[1:35:33] JUST MAKES ME SHUDDER TO THINK
[1:35:35] [screaming] OF GOD'S GOODNESS TO YOU.
[1:35:38] HIS GOODNESS TO ME.
[1:35:41] [applause]
[1:35:41] DON'T SPURN GOD'S LOVE. DON'T SPURN
[1:35:45] GOD'S GRACE. CAN YOU SAY
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, it was a beaten goat. When
[1:35:52] you go back and you look at it, it was a
[1:35:54] beaten goat. It was It was Amen. The
[1:35:58] dross was going to come out of it. Amen.
[1:36:00] God was going to put you through THE
[1:36:02] TEST AND GOD WAS GOING TO PUT THINGS AND
[1:36:05] APPLY PRESSURE IN YOUR LIFE. AMEN. But
[1:36:08] remember, every test, EVERY [screaming]
[1:36:11] TRIAL IS TO BRING purity out of you.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] This is what second Peter 1 and3 says,
[1:36:22] "But according as his divine power,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; hath given unto us all things." Somebody
[1:36:30] say, "All things."
[1:36:32] that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:36:36] through the knowledge of him who hath
[1:36:37] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[1:36:40] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:36:44] precious promises. And I love this part
[1:36:47] right here. Why don't we just all say it
[1:36:49] together? That by these YE MIGHT BE
[1:36:53] partakers of the divine nature.
[1:36:59] Well, I figured y'all would be up
[1:37:00] dancing the aisles on that one. That we
[1:37:03] might be partakers of his divine nature.
[1:37:07] I don't care what your past is. I don't
[1:37:09] care what what situation what you're
[1:37:11] going through right now. Amen. Remember,
[1:37:13] God's got a divine purpose that by these
[1:37:15] you might be partakers of the divine
[1:37:17] nature, having escaped the corruption
[1:37:20] that is in this world through lust. I I
[1:37:23] And so I'm saying that God's church,
[1:37:27] WHEN GOD LOOKED AT YOU, when he's
[1:37:30] looking at you, Kaye, when he's looking
[1:37:32] at at at at at at at you, I want to call
[1:37:35] you Connor. Amen. Whatever your name is.
[1:37:38] Amen. And and and APRIL AND JOHN AND
[1:37:42] FRESCA and what whatever your girl's
[1:37:45] name is. Amen. He's got he WHEN HE LOOKS
[1:37:47] AT YOU ALL, HE IS NOT LOOKING
[1:37:50] [screaming]
[1:37:51] AT YOUR HUMANITY. HE'S LOOKING AT HIS
[1:37:55] DIVINE
[1:37:57] GLORY UPON YOU.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; All right, let's look. Let's take
[1:38:04] another type.
[1:38:06] The mercy seat. The mercy seat
[1:38:10] was made of shitwood. Now, how many
[1:38:12] knows what the mercy seat? The mercy
[1:38:14] seat was where Amen. That that was in
[1:38:17] between the the two cherubams and and
[1:38:20] and the glory of God would rest settle
[1:38:22] down upon that seat. That's that was
[1:38:24] that was God's throne. THAT WAS GOD'S
[1:38:27] EARTHLY THRONE. He would come right
[1:38:30] there.
[1:38:31] That's why David says, "Hey man, how is
[1:38:33] it that I live in sealed houses and you
[1:38:35] live in a tent?" See, that was where God
[1:38:40] Well, now, but this this this mercy seat
[1:38:45] was made of wood.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was it was it was not really
[1:38:53] the best of woods.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not Well, Glory to God. Oh,
[1:38:59] that just makes me want to shout. So, so
[1:39:01] we we we when when when we look then
[1:39:04] they would take then they would take the
[1:39:07] the gold and they WOULD MELT THAT GOLD
[1:39:11] and it would be over the top. It would
[1:39:14] all be on the outside. It would be on
[1:39:16] the inside. So every bit of the wood
[1:39:23] humanity
[1:39:25] would now have [screaming] gold deity
[1:39:29] all around it. Now it was A TYPE OF
[1:39:30] CHRIST who is our mercy seat.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; CHRIST IS OUR MERCY SEAT.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He be he was a human. He was human
[1:39:42] made of ma made of of of the SHITTAMWOOD
[1:39:46] O OVERLAID INSIDE AND OUT WITH THAT
[1:39:48] GOLD. HALLELUJAH. Now that shiddamwood
[1:39:51] was was one of the most porest
[1:39:54] of of of woods. It it would soak up
[1:39:56] anything. Hallelujah. Well, glory to
[1:39:58] God.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Your flesh will soak up evil. It'll soak
[1:40:04] up good.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; And that's WHY YOU NEED THE BAPTISM OF
[1:40:07] THE HOLY GHOST OR YOU can't even be
[1:40:09] considered a part of the CHURCH YET.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS WHEN DEITY
[1:40:14] COMES UPON YOU.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? THAT'S WHY WE SAY
[1:40:20] YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE BAPTISM OF THE
[1:40:22] HOLY GHOST. BUT THAT SHAM WOULD IT IT
[1:40:24] WAS SO POROUS. AND SO THEY WOULD TAKE
[1:40:25] THAT GOLD, MELT IT, AND POUR IT OVER AND
[1:40:28] THE GO THE WOOD would suck it in until
[1:40:33] the wood and the gold become one.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord. Where
[1:40:41] was it positioned? It was positioned in
[1:40:45] the most holy place. THAT WAS WHERE GOD
[1:40:48] WOULD COME DOWN UPON THAT UPON THAT
[1:40:51] WOOD. WELL, PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:40:53] ARE ARE YOU HEARING ME? THE MERCY SEAT
[1:40:56] SET ON THE TOP OF THAT. AND THAT IS
[1:40:58] WHERE GOD FORGAVE SINS. THAT'S WHERE GOD
[1:41:01] WOULD VISIT THE PRIEST. THAT'S WHERE GOD
[1:41:03] WOULD WOULD MOVE and and the presence of
[1:41:05] the Lord would be known.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus Christ become our
[1:41:12] he become our ark of the covenant. He
[1:41:14] become our mercy seat.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; But but praise the Lord. Wouldn't the
[1:41:19] second person of the Godhead? Wasn't the
[1:41:20] third person of the Godhead? Wasn't the
[1:41:21] FIFTH PERSON OF THE IT WAS ALMIGHTY
[1:41:23] [screaming] God
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; coming down in that body
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and become so at one with him. Now the
[1:41:30] flesh still looked to God and said,
[1:41:33] "Father,
[1:41:34] Amen. Are you hearing me?"
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I knew nothing except the father.
[1:41:39] Someone said, "Well, why did Jesus
[1:41:41] pray?" He was a man. Hallelujah.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; But within him was the fullness of the
[1:41:47] godhead bodily. There you go.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Today they're so synonymous. The wood
[1:41:52] and the gold is so well. Praise the name
[1:41:54] of the Lord. He was your kinsman
[1:41:56] redeemer. He become one of us in order
[1:41:58] to redeem you. Come on now. Look at Boaz
[1:42:02] and Ruth. Amen. There had to be a
[1:42:04] kinsman redeemer. There had to be. NO
[1:42:07] ONE ELSE COULD DO IT. AMEN. WHEN NAOMI
[1:42:09] COME BACK THERE, THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
[1:42:11] THAT COULD REDEEM. THAT WAS THE KINSMAN
[1:42:13] REDEEMER. AND WHEN IT COME TO YOU, YOU
[1:42:16] ARE FLESH. YES, BUT YOU ARE ALSO THE
[1:42:20] CHILDREN OF THE MOST HIGH GOD.
[1:42:21] [screaming]
[1:42:22] WITHIN YOU IS A SOUL. THAT SOUL CAME
[1:42:24] FROM GOD. YES, THAT SOUL WAS LOST.
[1:42:27] [screaming] BUT GOD HAD TO COME DOWN TO
[1:42:30] REDEEM you in your fallen condition.
[1:42:34] IT HAD [screaming] TO BE. NO OTHER HUMAN
[1:42:37] BEING COULD COULD REDEEM YOU.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; You can't die for me. I CAN'T DIE FOR
[1:42:43] YOU. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE we're rejects.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] Why was God worried about that then?
[1:42:55] What do you mean? Because we were kin to
[1:42:58] God. We were made in the image of God.
[1:43:00] Yeah. Our soul came from God. [laughter]
[1:43:03] Are y'all hearing me? So now here we ARE
[1:43:05] IN A SPLIT NATURE. WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT
[1:43:08] SOULS AND WE GOT A FLESH AND WE'RE NEVER
[1:43:11] GOING TO GO BACK UNTIL there's
[1:43:12] redemption so God become a human being.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; God could become a human being so that
[1:43:19] he could die pay the price
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; to take us back to where we belong.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you when God looks at
[1:43:25] you, Dylan, he's not looking at you as a
[1:43:28] as as a reject anymore. You're a reject
[1:43:30] for the world. Amen. We're we're we're
[1:43:33] all rejects. But but I want to but but
[1:43:35] that's not who you are. YOU'RE A SON OF
[1:43:38] GOD. YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. WELL, PRAISE
[1:43:40] THE NAME OF THE LORD. HOW WE NEED TO
[1:43:42] TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. LORD, I ACCEPT YOUR
[1:43:45] BLOOD. I APPLY [screaming] YOUR BLOOD. I
[1:43:47] I'M GOING TO COME BEFORE YOUR THRONE. I
[1:43:50] WANT YOU TO MOVE WITHIN ME. I want to
[1:43:53] become your mercy seat.
[1:43:59] You say
[1:44:02] you become the mercy seat.
[1:44:05] You do.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; For when Christ comes in you, Jesus
[1:44:10] looked at the apostles and says,
[1:44:11] "Whatsoever you bind on earth, I'll bind
[1:44:15] in heaven. Whatever you bind uh h loose
[1:44:19] on earth, I'll loose in heaven."
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] That's the elect of God.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. How do we do the greater works?
[1:44:31] The greater works is when we extend
[1:44:33] mercy.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Greater works than these shall you do.
[1:44:37] What is these greater works? Preaching
[1:44:39] the gospel of Jesus Christ. Declaring
[1:44:42] who who your children are. Preach that
[1:44:44] gospel. That's the greater works. That's
[1:44:47] the power of the Holy Spirit. How am I
[1:44:50] we don't we don't loosen sin. We don't
[1:44:51] we we we don't loosen sins and bind
[1:44:54] people's sins uh uh like the Catholic
[1:44:56] Church does. No. How how DO WE LOOSE
[1:44:58] SINS? WE PREACH THE WORD. REPENT. BE
[1:45:00] BAPTIZED [screaming] EVERY ONE OF YOU IN
[1:45:02] THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE
[1:45:03] REMISSION OF SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE
[1:45:05] THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. FOR THE
[1:45:06] PROMISE IS UNTO YOU, UNTO YOUR CHILDREN
[1:45:08] AS MANY AS THE LORD THY GOD SHOULD
[1:45:09] [screaming] CALL. AND ON THAT DAY 3,000
[1:45:13] SOULS WERE ADDED to the church. Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Someone done some binding and loosening
[1:45:21] that day. The gospel preached bind.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Let's see. That's that's it was now in
[1:45:27] the church. IT WAS JESUS WAS GOD. NOW
[1:45:31] [screaming] THE CHURCH THE CHURCH
[1:45:34] [clears throat]
[1:45:35] WAS NOW LIVING AND EXPRESSING THE GRACE
[1:45:37] OF GOD. AND 3,000 SOULS [screaming] WERE
[1:45:40] SAVED BY THE PREACHING OF THE CHURCH.
[1:45:44] RIGHT.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; They become you become you become the
[1:45:50] mercy seat.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; That makes me
[1:46:01] that that makes me want to shout
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; without controversy. Great is the
[1:46:06] mystery of godliness. God manifest in
[1:46:09] the flesh. Can you say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:46:14] Amen. He's redeemed. Revelations 5 and9.
[1:46:17] And they sung and I'm going I know I'm
[1:46:18] I' I've left off my main point, but I'm
[1:46:20] getting back to it. I promise. Amen. But
[1:46:22] they Revelations 5:9, they sung a a NEW
[1:46:25] SONG, SAYING, "THOU art worthy to take
[1:46:28] the book and to open the SEALS THEREOF.
[1:46:30] FOR THOU WAS SLAIN, AND HAST REDEEMED US
[1:46:34] TO GOD [screaming]
[1:46:36] BY THY BLOOD OUT OF EVERY KINDRED,
[1:46:39] TONGUE, PEOPLE, AND NATION." IF YOU'RE
[1:46:42] REDEEMED, IF YOU'RE REDEEMED,
[1:46:44] [screaming] THEN HOW CAN YOU BE A
[1:46:46] SINNER? IF YOU'RE REDEEMED, HOW CAN YOU
[1:46:49] BE JUDGED FOR YOUR SIN? IF YOU
[1:46:51] [screaming] ARE REDEEMED, HOW MANY
[1:46:54] REDEEMED IS IN THE BUILDING TODAY? WE'RE
[1:46:57] REDEEMED BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:47:08] we're going to stop there for a moment.
[1:47:12] It's an earthly. Now I want because I
[1:47:14] want us to get at the stars real
[1:47:15] quickly. Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; This now there were the seven churches
[1:47:23] humans that were
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; anointed of the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:31] Oh, glory to God. It I I don't know what
[1:47:33] you guys are feeling up there, but it's
[1:47:34] it's pretty good right here.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:38] Hallelujah. And when I begin to feel
[1:47:40] this good, I'm I'm I'm about ready to go
[1:47:42] find a devil to kick on. Hallelujah.
[1:47:45] Amen. Why? We're anointed for this.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; It's the word that HAS ANOINTED US.
[1:47:49] WE'RE GETTING it from the revelation of
[1:47:52] who we are.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; That does that. We don't need somebody
[1:47:56] WITH GREAT SOME KIND OF A GREAT
[1:47:58] SPIRITUAL GIFT. WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS
[1:48:00] FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE,
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; MAN.
[1:48:07] So there were seven church ages or seven
[1:48:10] seven church uh seven candlesticks were
[1:48:13] the seven periods of time. God used the
[1:48:18] characteristics of those seven churches
[1:48:21] in the seven uh uh to to point out the
[1:48:25] characteristics throughout the seven
[1:48:27] periods of church history. So these last
[1:48:30] 2,000 years is now is is is there's
[1:48:33] seven periods of time that God has
[1:48:36] allotted and he has fortold what was
[1:48:40] going to happen in each one of those
[1:48:42] periods of history down through church
[1:48:44] uh through the church history and that's
[1:48:46] the reason why he even foretold that
[1:48:49] that that that the uh the Protestant
[1:48:51] movement would would come up out of the
[1:48:53] Catholic church after a thousand years
[1:48:55] amen almost a millennium of of the of
[1:48:58] the Catholic Church reign. pain in the
[1:48:59] dark in in the dark ages.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then here come Martin Luther
[1:49:04] coming up resisting says you have just a
[1:49:07] little bit of strength but if you Amen.
[1:49:09] But but but but you're you're you're
[1:49:10] you're staying true to my name. Amen.
[1:49:13] Here comes Luther and then here comes on
[1:49:16] out and and and another THE PHILADELPHIA
[1:49:19] WITH WESLEY. Each each one of these new
[1:49:22] periods OF TIME. AMEN. GOD IS IS
[1:49:24] DECLARING THROUGH THOSE times what was
[1:49:27] going to be taking place. NOW BUT I I
[1:49:30] WANT US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEVEN
[1:49:32] angels of the seven churches now I want
[1:49:35] us to just look at this those word that
[1:49:37] word angels comes uh from the Greek word
[1:49:41] angelos that is that is a n g o s and
[1:49:46] the strongs g32
[1:49:50] and and it's angelos is a very is a very
[1:49:54] broad term
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; and so it means messenger. So, so when
[1:50:00] in in the Greek the when they're using
[1:50:02] messenger then they expect you to take
[1:50:06] the context of what is being said and
[1:50:09] then you can understand. So when that
[1:50:11] angel that messenger came to Mary amen
[1:50:16] and the brightness and then you
[1:50:18] understood that that was a supernatural
[1:50:22] uh being. But when looking here, amen,
[1:50:26] this here was talking to the angel of
[1:50:29] the churches. [snorts]
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. These were messengers of the
[1:50:34] churches or uh uh UH ACTUALLY THE
[1:50:37] PASTORS OF THE CHURCHES. That that's who
[1:50:40] they were talking about there in those
[1:50:43] seven uh physical uh uh uh churches in
[1:50:46] Asia. So, so they were sent they were
[1:50:50] sent there were seven copies made of
[1:50:52] this and sent to all seven of ages,
[1:50:54] seven of uh uh seven churches. But it
[1:50:57] was representative
[1:51:00] OF WHAT GOD WAS GOING TO DO in the
[1:51:04] church ages. How many's understanding
[1:51:06] it? It was a type of what the church was
[1:51:09] going to be.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Now, so amen. So it in it envelopes the
[1:51:16] envelopes the the divine and the earthly
[1:51:21] messengers. So but but the the classical
[1:51:24] biblical Greek meaning to that term,
[1:51:27] Amen, is someone sent with a message, an
[1:51:31] envoy, a representative. Amen. So it
[1:51:34] it's an earthly it's an earthly
[1:51:36] messenger. BUT IT CAN ALSO be be used uh
[1:51:40] uh be be referred to heavenly divine
[1:51:43] beings such as angels. But but when that
[1:51:46] scripture was I I send my messenger
[1:51:48] BEFORE MY FACE. WELL, THAT WAS talking
[1:51:50] of prophet John. That was an angel. I
[1:51:52] send my angel before my face to prepare
[1:51:55] the way of the Lord. Well, amen. Jesus
[1:51:58] says, "Well, that that that messenger
[1:52:00] was John and YOU MISSED HIM. YOU WERE
[1:52:03] LOOKING FOR A heavenly angel and here I
[1:52:06] CAME TO JOHN COME PREACH IT TO YOU.
[1:52:09] WELL, the prophet is a messenger.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD IS DEALING WITH THE SEVEN
[1:52:15] church ages and he's dealing to the
[1:52:18] messengers of the age, he is NOT
[1:52:21] NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT the heavenly
[1:52:24] angels. These were going to be seven men
[1:52:29] in these seven PERIODS OF TIME THAT God
[1:52:32] was going to anoint.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Now, it was not going to be these men on
[1:52:37] their own because we're we're fixing to
[1:52:39] find out here in a minute. Amen. That
[1:52:41] that there are seven spirits around the
[1:52:44] throne of God,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; AND THOSE SEVEN SPIRITS HAD TO COME DOWN
[1:52:49] AND anoint the seven messengers.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so keep keep that in your
[1:52:55] mind. Amen. So, the context is is is is
[1:52:58] very very important. So, we've got we
[1:53:00] we've got to the angel of Ephesus, the
[1:53:03] angel of Samrna. Amen. But again, you go
[1:53:06] back all you know 90% of all the
[1:53:09] scholars says it was talking to earthly
[1:53:13] messengers.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were angels. THEY WERE
[1:53:16] DECLARING THE MESSAGE to that church.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:53:23] Now, so um so as we read or as as we go
[1:53:29] on, so the earthly and the heavenly were
[1:53:33] we're we're both of God. Amen. They
[1:53:36] because it required the heavenly angel
[1:53:39] to give the inspiration to the earthly
[1:53:41] angel. And that's how Amen. it becomes
[1:53:44] so supernatural. That's how Martin
[1:53:47] Luther stood against the entire world
[1:53:50] and was able to resist the Catholic
[1:53:52] Church.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Tell me, tell you say, "No, it was just
[1:53:55] that just happened." Why didn't Husk and
[1:53:57] why didn't Wikliff and why or not
[1:53:59] Wikliff but uh uh uh some of these
[1:54:02] others uh down through the history there
[1:54:04] that was trying to resist the CATHOLIC
[1:54:05] CHURCH, THEY COULDN'T DO IT. It wasn't
[1:54:07] the time yet.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; So without going through any of that
[1:54:14] depth, I I I my my my my purpose is to
[1:54:18] understand that where we are
[1:54:23] and that the anointing that's upon this
[1:54:25] wood,
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; This anointing that
[1:54:29] [laughter and gasps]
[1:54:30] Hallelujah. If if if you would just
[1:54:33] start looking at that brother and and
[1:54:35] quit looking at him as the shittam would
[1:54:37] and start looking at him as the ark. All
[1:54:41] right.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Now, you say, "No, no, no. God's the one
[1:54:45] that made you the gold.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; It's God that has done that." And any of
[1:54:49] our power comes from God. There'll never
[1:54:51] come anything. So, I'm not saying that
[1:54:53] you're God. I am saying,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; "Come on,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; you're made out of the Just as you're
[1:54:58] made out of the same dust I'm made out
[1:55:00] of, I'm made out of the same gold he's
[1:55:02] made of."
[1:55:05] [laughter]
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I MADE IT THE SAME GOAL.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now I want you to look.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; So that heavenly angel gave the
[1:55:18] inspiration to the earthly. Both shared
[1:55:21] the task giving the the message uh to to
[1:55:25] the people. Amen. They were both sent
[1:55:28] with God's word. In other words, you
[1:55:30] could have a messenger, earthly
[1:55:31] messenger, but if he is not vindicated
[1:55:33] by God,
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[1:55:38] But let's look at it. Let's look at a
[1:55:40] few things here in the scripture. Just
[1:55:41] just real quickly. Do we still have
[1:55:42] time?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the sevens. Let's look at
[1:55:45] a few sevens just real quick. I want I
[1:55:47] want to look at a seven. There are seven
[1:55:49] heavenly messengers. There are sevenly
[1:55:52] earthly messengers. And there are seven
[1:55:55] churches. Now, I I want us to just look
[1:55:58] in the Bible here for a few moments that
[1:56:00] Revelations 1 and 4. Turn to it if you
[1:56:03] wouldn't mind, Sister Keys. I want you
[1:56:05] to put that up, too. But uh let let's
[1:56:07] turn to it so you'll know it's in the
[1:56:08] Bible. Amen. I I I sometimes I go to
[1:56:12] this when people are trying to tell me
[1:56:13] that there's more than one God
[1:56:16] and then I give them this revelation. I
[1:56:18] tell them I think there's seven.
[1:56:22] JOHN TO THE SEVEN churches which are in
[1:56:24] Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from
[1:56:27] him which is which was which is to come
[1:56:30] and from the seven spirits
[1:56:33] which are before
[1:56:36] his throne. Let's go to Revelations 4
[1:56:38] and5.
[1:56:41] It's going to progressively give us it's
[1:56:43] going to give us a deeper meaning as we
[1:56:45] as we progress in
[1:56:48] Revelations 4 and 5. And out of the
[1:56:49] throne proceeded lightnings and
[1:56:51] thunderings and voices. And there were
[1:56:52] seven lamps. Remember the seven church
[1:56:55] ages. There were seven lamps of fire
[1:56:59] burning before the throne, which are the
[1:57:04] seven spirits of God. So we've got out.
[1:57:07] Now I want us to look. We've got the
[1:57:08] seven the seven churches, the seven
[1:57:12] candlesticks, and they're relying on the
[1:57:15] presence OF THE LORD. IT'S GOT to be the
[1:57:18] same anointing of the of the DAY OF
[1:57:21] PENTECOST, THE PILLAR of fire, the
[1:57:23] almighty God, the logos. It's got TO BE
[1:57:26] THAT SAME ANOINTING. And there are seven
[1:57:29] spirits. You say, "Are there really
[1:57:31] seven spirits?" No. God's giving us
[1:57:34] visuals.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; SEVEN ANOINTINGS THAT WERE GOING TO
[1:57:39] ANOINT THAT CHURCH, THAT THOSE EARTHLY
[1:57:42] church throughout that church ages.
[1:57:46] Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Those church ages. Can you say amen?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; okay. So, now he's saying those seven
[1:57:52] lamps. Now, now he was saying seven
[1:57:56] spirits before the throne. Now, he's
[1:57:58] saying there's seven lamps of fire
[1:58:00] burning before the throne, which are the
[1:58:01] seven spirits of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:58:05] Now, now remember, if you go to
[1:58:07] Zechariah, if you read that whole there,
[1:58:08] they're there in Zechariah 4 and2, you
[1:58:10] know, when he when he asked him, "What
[1:58:12] what are you looking at?" And he talks
[1:58:13] about the candlesticks and he and he's
[1:58:15] talking about the bowls and you know and
[1:58:18] and the lamp and it shall not be by
[1:58:20] might nor by power but by my spirit. If
[1:58:22] you were to go down to the 10th verse
[1:58:23] there uh uh Zechariah 4:10 for who
[1:58:26] despised the day of small things for
[1:58:28] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[1:58:32] plummet in the hand of Zerubel with
[1:58:34] those seven. They are the eyes of the
[1:58:37] Lord which run to and fro throughout the
[1:58:42] earth. Now we're looking. Amen. When
[1:58:44] he's when he's look when he's talking
[1:58:45] about those seven candlesticks. Now he's
[1:58:48] saying those lamps are the eyes of the
[1:58:51] Lord roaming to and fro. He's
[1:58:53] prophesying of that church that is to
[1:58:55] come. Let's stay with me. How many still
[1:58:57] with me? Amen. Revelations 5 and six.
[1:59:00] Amen. Revelations 5 and six.
[1:59:04] And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of
[1:59:06] the throne, and of the four beasts, in
[1:59:08] the midst of the elders, stood a lamb as
[1:59:11] it had been slain. Now, here's the lamb
[1:59:14] having SEVEN HORNS,
[1:59:18] SEVEN EYES,
[1:59:20] WHICH ARE THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD SENT
[1:59:24] FORTH INTO THE EARTH. SO NOW WE'RE FIND
[1:59:27] NOW WE'RE NOW YOU I WANT YOU TO JUST
[1:59:28] CATCH the seven seven7 eye spirits. Now
[1:59:31] the Lord is showing his here. Amen. It
[1:59:34] is the lamb in the church. It is deity
[1:59:40] in humanity. [screaming]
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; AND THE LIGHT OF THE [screaming] SEVEN
[1:59:49] CANDLESTICKS ARE THE SPIRITS OF GOD, THE
[1:59:54] EYES OF God throughout all of the earth.
[1:59:59] But now he's bringing in the horns.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Horns have always represented strength.
[2:00:05] Look it up in the Bible. The horns of my
[2:00:08] salvation.
[2:00:09] The seven horns.
[2:00:11] The lamb had seven horns.
[2:00:15] There's going to be the power of God.
[2:00:17] There's going to be the life of God. Are
[2:00:20] you hearing me? Amen. Now I'm I'm still
[2:00:23] talking about the stars, the light.
[2:00:26] These messengers, amen, THE ARE EARTHLY
[2:00:30] MESSENGERS. BUT there is a there THERE
[2:00:33] IS THE ALL OF HEAVEN.
[2:00:40] Old New Testament is all one story.
[2:00:44] REDEMPTION.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL ONE STORY. NOW, I WE'RE NOT
[2:00:49] GOING TO GO THROUGH THE elders and the
[2:00:50] and throughout, you know, WE'RE NOT
[2:00:52] DOING THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT
[2:00:54] HERE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STARS AND
[2:00:56] THE CANDLESTICKS.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; The seven stars
[2:01:03] are giving light to the church. So, when
[2:01:05] you when you go and you read there, um,
[2:01:08] [snorts]
[2:01:09] let's just now hang on to my thought.
[2:01:11] Don't don't don't leave what I'm saying.
[2:01:13] Don't don't leave. Hang on to it. Amen.
[2:01:16] But but I I I want to just show you.
[2:01:18] Okay. Revelations 2 2 and 1. Unto the
[2:01:23] angel of the church of Ephesus. Right.
[2:01:26] That was the first church age. Amen. Go
[2:01:28] on down to the eth verse. UNTO THE ANGEL
[2:01:31] OF THE CHURCH IN SAMRA. RIGHT. OKAY.
[2:01:34] AMEN. Going down to the 12th verse. Unto
[2:01:37] the angel of the church of Pergamus.
[2:01:39] Right. YOU YOU GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. SEE,
[2:01:41] THIS WAS MYSTERIOUS
[2:01:44] UNTIL THE LAST DAY. AND IN THE DAYS OF
[2:01:47] THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH MESSENGER, the
[2:01:50] mystery will be finished.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; God promised that he would do that. Now,
[2:01:59] am I making sense to you all?
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; It is as CHRIST IS STANDING THERE. IT IS
[2:02:07] IT IS IT'S NOT SEVEN SPIRITS. It is it
[2:02:11] in in the fact that because God done
[2:02:13] said here, oh Israel, there's one Lord
[2:02:16] and he says there is no God beside me.
[2:02:19] So he's not going to turn around in the
[2:02:20] Old Testament, no God beside me and now
[2:02:22] I've got seven of them beside me.
[2:02:25] No, no. It's God showing
[2:02:29] that the church age is going to have
[2:02:32] seven particular
[2:02:34] periods.
[2:02:36] And throughout these periods,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's it, brother.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you.
[2:02:47] seven different periods of time. But my
[2:02:50] anointing is with where my anointing is,
[2:02:53] my strength is.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; My eyes are roaming to and fro.
[2:03:00] [laughter]
[2:03:01] I'm in my church. I'm living my life. My
[2:03:06] anointing is upon you. Can you say amen?
[2:03:10] So then we find that when we go down
[2:03:12] through these ages that God would raise
[2:03:14] up men. These were be these would be
[2:03:18] seven distinct men throughout the
[2:03:20] periods of time that God would raise up
[2:03:23] to bring light to that generation. These
[2:03:26] would be human beings. They were they
[2:03:29] were sinners that had to BE SAVED BY GOD
[2:03:32] JUST LIKE YOU. THEY WERE GOING TO DIE
[2:03:35] JUST LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO die unless you
[2:03:37] make the rapture. this we're at the
[2:03:39] season of rapture. The these these are
[2:03:41] these are these KINDS OF MEN. BUT THESE
[2:03:43] WERE MEN THAT GOD SEPARATED TO HIMSELF.
[2:03:47] YOU SAY, IF WE'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST,
[2:03:50] THEN THEN THEN WHY DO WE WHY DO WE NEED
[2:03:52] I DON'T KNOW WHY GOD HAD THE LAMPSTANDS
[2:03:54] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN STARS.
[2:04:01] The lamp had the oil UNDER HERE.
[2:04:04] BUT WHEN GOD WANTED TO REVEAL ANYTHING
[2:04:06] TO THESE LAMPSTANDS,
[2:04:09] unto the angel, right?
[2:04:11] Unto the angel, right?
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Unto the angel, right?
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Unto the angel, right?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; You see WHAT I'M SAYING? SO WHAT WHAT
[2:04:22] I'M TRYING TO GET TO YOU IS see God
[2:04:27] GOD DOES THINGS THAT HIDES HIS MYSTERIES
[2:04:30] IN SUCH incredible ways that the church
[2:04:32] world won't even know anything about.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; And then Satan will come in and he knows
[2:04:38] that there's going to be an earthly
[2:04:40] church or an earthly strength. There's
[2:04:41] going you're going to be his earthly
[2:04:43] body. And so that's the reason why Satan
[2:04:45] has got all of these other junk going
[2:04:47] out there where people don't even want
[2:04:48] to trust the church anymore. They don't
[2:04:51] even want to come into a church because
[2:04:53] all that just filth of all the
[2:04:55] prostitutes out there that have
[2:04:56] prostituted the word of God
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; till they look at you and think you're
[2:05:01] just weird.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:05:06] Right.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; And and and and you can look you can
[2:05:09] take them right back TO SCRIPTURE. I WAS
[2:05:11] BAPTIZED THE WAY PAUL OR PETER SAID TO
[2:05:13] BE BAPTIZED. I BELIEVE IT THE WAY AND
[2:05:15] they'll still look at you. No, no, no.
[2:05:16] That's not the way my harlot church
[2:05:18] teaches. That's not the way that we
[2:05:20] understand it. Well, praise the Lord.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; But God's got his God's got his. Amen.
[2:05:29] God's standing there. The the the Bible
[2:05:32] the Bible says in this last church age,
[2:05:34] Amen. He says unto the angel of the of
[2:05:36] of of the church of Leodysy. Matter of
[2:05:38] fact, let's just let's just read it. Um
[2:05:40] uh we'll just read this is our church
[2:05:42] age. This is what this is the
[2:05:44] pronouncement to our age.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. that there in in in Revelations 3
[2:05:49] and4 unto the angel or the messenger of
[2:05:53] the church of the leodysans write these
[2:05:56] things sayaeth the a man the faithful
[2:05:58] and true witness the beginning of the
[2:06:00] creation of God I know thy works now if
[2:06:03] this don't depict us dear God I know THY
[2:06:07] WORKS THAT THOU ART NEITHER COLD NOR hot
[2:06:11] wood thou were cold or hot so then
[2:06:12] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[2:06:14] cold nor hot I will spew thee out OF MY
[2:06:17] MOUTH
[2:06:17] BECAUSE THOU SAYEST, I'M a rich church.
[2:06:23] Increase with goods. He's talking to the
[2:06:25] church now.
[2:06:26] Increase with goods and have need of
[2:06:28] nothing. And he says, you're deceived.
[2:06:31] And knowest not knowest thou uh uh
[2:06:35] knowest not that thou art wretched,
[2:06:39] miserable, poor, blind, and naked. I
[2:06:43] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[2:06:45] the fire that thou mayest be rich white
[2:06:48] raignment that thou mayest be clothed
[2:06:50] that thy shame of thy nakedness do not
[2:06:52] appear. Anoint thine eyes with eye sad
[2:06:54] that thou mayest see as many as I love I
[2:06:57] rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore
[2:06:59] and repent. Do you realize that we were
[2:07:02] all born into this setting?
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:09] But the Holy Spirit has come and pulled
[2:07:12] you out
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm not going to have you.
[2:07:17] I'm not going to have my bride into this
[2:07:21] nonsense. You ain't on fire." What? What
[2:07:23] you talking about?
[2:07:27] You don't love my word. You'd rather
[2:07:29] debate it.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; You won't follow my word.
[2:07:34] You You You're just You're just wanting
[2:07:36] TO BE RELIGIOUS. I DON'T WANT YOU BEING
[2:07:39] RELIGIOUS. YOU ARE ME ON EARTH,
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; living in sin and GOING OUT AND DOING
[2:07:48] THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. [screaming]
[2:07:49] NO, GOD DOESN'T WANT A CHURCH MEMBER. HE
[2:07:53] WANTS A [screaming] BRIDE THAT HE CAN
[2:07:55] IMPREGNATE WITH HIS WORD.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:08:06] But there's lots of times that you
[2:08:08] ladies
[2:08:10] and there's for some reason, well, it's
[2:08:12] good reason that God typed his church as
[2:08:16] the bride.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I hope I'm doing all right here
[2:08:23] this morning. But I know my girl, when I
[2:08:26] talk to her, when she talks to me,
[2:08:27] sometimes she feels like she's not I'm
[2:08:30] just not good enough wife and I'm not a
[2:08:32] good enough mother. [sighs]
[2:08:39] You could have got somebody better.
[2:08:41] I'm just ugly.
[2:08:45] And I've counel counseledled enough of
[2:08:47] ladies that Amen. where that that that I
[2:08:50] know that that Satan fights you of your
[2:08:54] worthiness.
[2:08:58] And
[2:09:00] And it's not it's not bad. It's It's not
[2:09:03] bad in the slightest bit
[2:09:06] because God built the woman
[2:09:11] to be support
[2:09:14] to her man.
[2:09:16] God built the woman as a companion
[2:09:20] suitable for her man. That's what a help
[2:09:23] me is.
[2:09:26] So her desire is to please her husband.
[2:09:30] And if she doesn't feel like she's
[2:09:32] pleasing her husband or feels like she's
[2:09:34] not as good of enough mother, it it it
[2:09:37] brings an inferiority complex. And
[2:09:39] that's why us men have got to make sure
[2:09:42] that we're putting our our our our our
[2:09:45] arms around our wives and letting them
[2:09:47] know, I love you with all of my heart.
[2:09:50] And I when I say I love you, I mean it.
[2:09:56] And that's what God is saying to the
[2:09:58] church.
[2:10:00] You you you are you are you all through
[2:10:02] these ages all through these ages. You
[2:10:04] you're you're you're there.
[2:10:08] But I'm there with you. I'm walking in
[2:10:10] and out my spirit.
[2:10:13] There is a when a seven spirits let let
[2:10:15] me just deal with that for just a
[2:10:17] moment. I promise I'm shutting up.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Seven spirits. I'm going to shine a
[2:10:21] light on this specific part. Okay. Let's
[2:10:24] let's let's just just real quickly when
[2:10:26] when Luther coming out of the church
[2:10:28] ages or coming out of that Catholic
[2:10:30] church, God shown a light. He was a he
[2:10:34] was a priest. He was trying to find
[2:10:35] peace for him. So he couldn't he
[2:10:37] couldn't find it. They sent him to Rome.
[2:10:39] And so he's he's he's he's he's going up
[2:10:41] kissing and crawling these steps and
[2:10:43] kissing these crosses when it struck to
[2:10:45] him. A light struck him and said, "The
[2:10:47] just shall live by faith." Then he gets
[2:10:50] up, dust his clothes off, and says, "You
[2:10:54] I'll never be able to earn peace." Now,
[2:10:56] he had done everything. He he had he had
[2:10:59] beat his back until it was just bloody
[2:11:02] pulp trying to find peace. They told
[2:11:03] him, "If you do this, you do this, you
[2:11:05] do this." So, now he's trying. He's he's
[2:11:07] he's his knees are bleeding as he is as
[2:11:09] he is crawling up and kissing so many
[2:11:13] crosses and keeps on crawling and keep
[2:11:15] and when the Lord appeared to him the
[2:11:17] just shall live by faith that anointing
[2:11:20] that was upon the earth so changed him.
[2:11:23] But it didn't just change him also was
[2:11:25] it was also moving on other men too. And
[2:11:27] the gospel was being uh was being
[2:11:30] printed and and then the presence of the
[2:11:32] Lord was was was being it was it was God
[2:11:36] moving. Are y'all understanding WHAT I'M
[2:11:38] SAYING? SO it is in this last day. God
[2:11:41] is calling the church. Amen. God is
[2:11:44] calling this elect. He's he's he now
[2:11:46] he's pronouncing judgment upon the the
[2:11:48] HE'S PRONOUNCING JUDGMENT UPON
[2:11:51] AND AND I'M NOT MAKING THAT AND
[2:11:52] HARLOTS UP. That's in the Bible. Y'all
[2:11:54] know that, right? That's that's that's
[2:11:55] all throughout the book of Revelation.
[2:11:57] HE'S JUDGING THEM, BUT HE'S ALSO SAYING
[2:12:00] THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY [screaming]
[2:12:02] THAT'S GOING TO WASH THEIR EYES with
[2:12:04] Isa,
[2:12:06] listen to the voice of that messenger as
[2:12:10] he begins TO DECREE AND CRY out
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; there. Um, if you wouldn't mind putting
[2:12:22] up um
[2:12:26] Malachi 4
[2:12:29] and the first verse, [snorts] this is
[2:12:32] talk this is right at the end. And this
[2:12:34] is this is God talking about the about
[2:12:36] about me and you. And and I'm closing.
[2:12:38] This is going to be my last scripture
[2:12:40] here. For behold, the day cometh that
[2:12:42] shall burn as an oven. This is this is
[2:12:44] talking about when the earth shall burn
[2:12:46] as a fervent heat, and all the proud,
[2:12:48] yay, all that do wicked shall be
[2:12:50] stubble, and the day that cometh shall
[2:12:53] burn them up, sayaeth the Lord, that it
[2:12:55] shall leave neither them neither root
[2:12:58] nor branch.
[2:13:00] Amen. We're just going to keep on going.
[2:13:03] But unto you that fear my name, the son
[2:13:05] of righteousness shall arise. The son
[2:13:08] shall the son of righteousness arise
[2:13:09] with healing in his wings and ye shall
[2:13:12] go forth and grow up as cals in the
[2:13:13] stall.
[2:13:15] Ye shall tread down the wicked for they
[2:13:18] shall be ashes. This is talking about
[2:13:19] the millennium. For they shall be ashes
[2:13:22] unto the souls of your feet in that day
[2:13:23] that I shall do this sayaith the Lord of
[2:13:25] hosts.
[2:13:27] Remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[2:13:29] which I commanded unto him in Horeb for
[2:13:31] all Israel with the statutes and
[2:13:33] judgments.
[2:13:35] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[2:13:39] prophet before the coming of the great
[2:13:41] and dreadful day of the Lord.
[2:13:44] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[2:13:47] fathers to the children, and the heart
[2:13:49] of the children to the uh fathers, lest
[2:13:53] I come and smite the earth with a curse.
[2:13:56] So we we can look here that there are
[2:14:00] specific promises that have been given.
[2:14:03] And I am out of time. But what I'm
[2:14:06] saying, the purpose was to turn our
[2:14:10] hearts
[2:14:12] back to the original.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Come back to the original.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; And today you find any hardly a church
[2:14:27] member, they ain't none of them want to
[2:14:29] go back to the original.
[2:14:31] [laughter]
[2:14:33] But the hearts
[2:14:35] of the children,
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; the ones who came from God, the ones
[2:14:40] that's going back to God, they're
[2:14:42] needing to hear something. They're
[2:14:44] needing to hear a voice saying, "John,
[2:14:47] John,
[2:14:49] YOU'RE BLIND. JOHN, YOU'RE IN LEOSA.
[2:14:51] [screaming] COME OUT AND I WILL ACCEPT
[2:14:54] YOU TO MYSELF.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH IS GOING TO HELL [laughter]
[2:14:57] IN A HAND BASKET, BUT COME ON OUT."
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; YEAH, BROTHER. COME back to the
[2:15:01] original.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; You love it.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come. Thanks for
[2:15:06] your patience this morning.
[2:15:08] [applause]
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY to God.
[2:15:15] I'm glad I heard it, buddy. I was I was
[2:15:17] a Pentecostal.
[2:15:21] I I I Well, I'm still Pentecostal in
[2:15:24] experience, but I was I was I
[2:15:27] Hallelujah.
[2:15:28] We we seen all kinds of stuff. I I saw
[2:15:31] miracles, healings, but there was
[2:15:33] [music] but there was so much junk
[2:15:35] involved. My faith could not ever rise
[2:15:37] to the occasion. It was it was under the
[2:15:40] [snorts] dictates of men here and there.
[2:15:42] Then I'd find out that my goodness, you
[2:15:45] know, the group that we fellowshipped
[2:15:47] with, I mean, you know,
[2:15:52] I don't guess they felt like there was
[2:15:54] enough laws in the Bible, so they they
[2:15:56] just made up laws, you know.
[2:15:58] and uh
[2:16:05] came came to church one time with a with
[2:16:08] with my hair parted in the middle and
[2:16:11] hallelujah. [music]
[2:16:13] Didn't think I was ever going to get out
[2:16:14] of purgatory for that one.
[2:16:18] But when you come,
[2:16:20] you find out when the book begins to
[2:16:21] open and as you begin to look at these
[2:16:24] symbols that begin to open and you begin
[2:16:26] to see everything that's in here,
[2:16:29] you begin to see all the mystery come
[2:16:31] together.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:38] Thank you for pulling me out." Well,
[2:16:40] where are you taking me to? What
[2:16:41] denomination? There is no denomination.
[2:16:46] Well, who where are we going? [music] To
[2:16:49] Jesus Christ, the word.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; That's who our messenger has pointed us
[2:16:57] to. Back to Christ.
[2:17:02] You're in his arms today. You're not in
[2:17:05] mine.
[2:17:07] In fact, God ain't going to have no
[2:17:09] manhandling of his word anymore. [music]
[2:17:12] And he ain't going to have his bride
[2:17:13] being manhandled by any by any by any
[2:17:16] theologian or any man. When God wants to
[2:17:19] speak, he will send a prophet and that
[2:17:23] prophet will come and back it up with
[2:17:25] thus sayeth the Lord and it'll be a
[2:17:26] vindicated word.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Because he wants you he wants your
[2:17:31] [music] faith to be solid in that
[2:17:34] almighty God.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. When John the Baptist come, he
[2:17:38] said, "Behold,
[2:17:40] behold
[2:17:41] the lamb of God."
[2:17:46] Only
[2:17:49] that was a that [music] was a that was a
[2:17:51] good amen.
[2:17:54] So the the [music] the the holy
[2:17:59] John was the was the messenger. John was
[2:18:02] the one that there in Malachi or Malachi
[2:18:05] 2. Malachi 3 talked of [music] of John
[2:18:10] coming to forrun Jesus. Isaiah spoke of
[2:18:14] him coming. A voice crying in the
[2:18:15] wilderness.
[2:18:19] Here come John.
[2:18:22] And the Bible says that John
[2:18:26] came out of the wilderness
[2:18:29] eating [clears throat]
[2:18:30] locust
[2:18:32] and honey. [music]
[2:18:35] And he was wrapped in sheep skin.
[2:18:39] His mother and father were old.
[2:18:40] Zachchariah and Elizabeth. They died
[2:18:44] when he was around 9 years old.
[2:18:47] And he went out in the wilderness is
[2:18:48] what is what the
[2:18:51] Josephus and the historians [music] say.
[2:18:58] And then he comes out
[2:19:01] maybe not having a bath in days, maybe
[2:19:03] not having a bath in months.
[2:19:07] He came out had hair all over him
[2:19:13] [laughter]
[2:19:15] and he's and he's out he's out there in
[2:19:17] the river Jordan and he says repent
[2:19:23] for he's coming. Repent. They all
[2:19:27] laughed laughed at him.
[2:19:34] But the Lord had already told him, "The
[2:19:35] one that you see the spirit descending
[2:19:37] upon, he's the one."
[2:19:40] And one day here Jesus came and he saw
[2:19:43] that [music] light following him.
[2:19:46] And he said, "Behold
[2:19:48] the lamb of God." [laughter]
[2:19:51] They're all looking at him. That that
[2:19:53] illegitimate
[2:19:56] child, that supposed son of Joseph.
[2:20:03] And who are you?
[2:20:06] Hair all over him.
[2:20:10] Hairy man.
[2:20:14] He stunk.
[2:20:17] But Jesus came to his prophet. met his
[2:20:19] prophet right there in the water. John
[2:20:21] says, "Hey, listen. I'm not worthy to
[2:20:24] baptize you. I'm not even worthy to
[2:20:26] unloose your your your sho strings."
[2:20:29] Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so."
[2:20:30] [music]
[2:20:31] Why? Because the lamb always had to be
[2:20:33] washed before it could be go into
[2:20:35] service. [music]
[2:20:37] He had to Well, praise the Lord.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So here come HERE
[2:20:44] COME THE MESSIAH TO the prophet.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:20:52] the Bible says [music]
[2:20:55] that that John
[2:20:58] that they got all they all got they all
[2:21:01] got a little bit disoriented got a
[2:21:03] little bit got a little bit uptight
[2:21:05] about it because all of John's disciples
[2:21:08] were leaving and following Jesus.
[2:21:11] Jesus and and John says I must [music]
[2:21:14] decrease
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; that he may increase. Now what I am
[2:21:18] saying here today [music]
[2:21:20] is this is a special day of all days.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; This is an introduction
[2:21:26] not to another church age but our
[2:21:28] prophet has introduced [music] us to the
[2:21:30] groom. This is rapturing time.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; This is a time of preparation. [music]
[2:21:40] I say, "God, I'm anointed for the
[2:21:42] season."
[2:21:46] I thank God. I thank God for his
[2:21:49] messenger. [music] And I I wish I would
[2:21:50] have had more time, but I don't. So, we
[2:21:52] won't we just stand to our feet and
[2:21:54] appreciate your patience here this
[2:21:56] morning.
[2:21:58] Praise the Lord. God is so good.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; God is so good to us.
[2:22:07] Huh?
[2:22:08] But in the days of the voice of the
[2:22:11] seventh messenger, when he shall begin
[2:22:13] to sound,
[2:22:18] when John the Baptist started declaring,
[2:22:21] "This is him.
[2:22:24] [music] It was over. Jesus was no longer
[2:22:26] a mystery. The prophet identified him."
[2:22:29] Now, whether everyone else was going to
[2:22:31] accept it, that's another story.
[2:22:34] But he was identified.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; There came a message in our day to
[2:22:41] identify Christ [music] and his mystery.
[2:22:46] Where is Christ? Who is he identifying?
[2:22:48] The bride.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Identifying the bride.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? Maybe I didn't
[2:22:56] bring that that last part in the way it
[2:22:58] was. [music] It was the identification
[2:23:00] of the groom. And then today is the
[2:23:02] identification of the bride. Christ
[2:23:04] [music] in his bride. That's what God is
[2:23:07] trying to show. Amen.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, we're dependent upon
[2:23:12] him. Yes, we've got to have him. Yes, we
[2:23:14] want to hear him. [music] Amen. He means
[2:23:16] everything to us. God richly bless you.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; What are you playing there, Brother
[2:23:20] Kobe?
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Calling [singing] out [music] Babylon.
[2:23:35] to a higher grave. [music] There is a
[2:23:40] mountain I [singing]
[2:23:41] can live upon.
[2:23:48] I have made [music and singing] my
[2:23:50] choice.
[2:23:52] Jesus is my joy. [music]
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Jesus. [music and singing]
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:24:13] I have heard a voice,
[2:24:17] calling me [music and singing] out of
[2:24:19] Babylon.
[2:24:21] Go low.
[2:24:23] He come down to the lowest.
[2:24:26] [music]
[2:24:27] He said, "I'll go down low. I'll go
[2:24:29] down. I'll I'll I'll I'll go down below
