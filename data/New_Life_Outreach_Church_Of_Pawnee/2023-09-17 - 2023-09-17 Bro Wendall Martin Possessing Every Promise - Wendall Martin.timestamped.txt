[42:36] the hearer today is my prayer in Jesus
[42:40] name we pray amen and amen God bless you
[42:45] you can be seated here today amen I want
[42:48] to speak for just a just a a few moments
[42:52] this morning on Amen a maybe a a a
[42:55] simple Le subject but amen the title
[42:58] possessing every promise I I'm I'm
[43:02] believing that we are looking here this
[43:04] morning at possessors amen we're we're
[43:08] not Spectators but we're possessors
[43:10] we're not amen um looking for something
[43:13] to come but we are living in the
[43:16] promises of God and I think if we're
[43:19] going to possess it matters what we're
[43:21] looking at and how we're looking at it
[43:23] brother Brandon preached the sermon on
[43:25] look and he says you can be looking at
[43:27] the same thing and yet not seeing the
[43:30] same thing amen you're not perceiving
[43:32] the same thing and so when God says to
[43:35] look unto me all ye ends of the world he
[43:39] is he is calling out to the elect amen
[43:43] and he's and he's and he's telling us
[43:45] amen there there is a there is a
[43:48] Redemption that is going to be coming up
[43:51] amen look to the Redeemer all of the
[43:53] redeemed look to the Redeemer because I
[43:57] am coming to redeem you to restore you
[44:01] to to bring you back can you say amen
[44:04] amen what you see will determine if
[44:08] you're seeing just Christianity as
[44:10] religion that's as far as you will go if
[44:13] you're seeing uh Christianity as just a
[44:16] a a sermon that's as far as you will go
[44:19] but if you see Christianity as
[44:22] Redemption and taking us back where we
[44:25] fell from
[44:26] amen then we will go there can you say
[44:29] Amen so Abraham amen now just to give a
[44:33] little bit of a background Abraham was
[44:36] given the Divine promise that he would
[44:39] possess the land that his seed would
[44:42] possess that land now lot followed
[44:46] Abraham and lot could not see what
[44:49] Abraham saw because uh even though it's
[44:53] the same land even though they were
[44:55] living living on the same property lot
[44:58] had a different eyesight than Abraham
[45:02] had why because Abraham was given
[45:05] Revelation by God lot had not had a
[45:09] revelation by God now I I want us to
[45:11] look at that because if if we're going
[45:14] to possess God's got to reveal to us
[45:17] what we are to possess amen you you
[45:21] there's there's no way you can get there
[45:23] without God revealing himself unto you
[45:28] amen and so we a as as we look there lot
[45:32] followed Abraham but his eyesight was
[45:35] not the same so there come a time when
[45:38] when lot lifted up his eyes amen there
[45:41] there in in Genesis 13 and 10 and and it
[45:45] talks about lot lifted up his eyes and
[45:48] he beheld Sodom and Gomorrah he beheld
[45:52] the well-watered plains he beheld the
[45:55] things of of of of ease and comfort well
[45:59] praise the Lord but you see Abraham's
[46:02] sights never left the word of God God
[46:06] gave him that promise and he would never
[46:10] ever leave that promise amen that's
[46:13] right so so when when and matters of
[46:15] fact when Abraham uh lot departed from
[46:18] Abraham then God appeared unto Abraham
[46:21] and said now you lift up your eyes amen
[46:25] you lift there in the 14th verse and the
[46:27] Lord said unto Abram a after that lot
[46:30] had separated from him lift up thine
[46:33] eyes and look from the place where thou
[46:36] art all the land you see I'm giving it
[46:40] unto you amen oh aren't you glad for
[46:43] that now lot wanted to see it but lot
[46:46] couldn't see it lot have he come from a
[46:48] different stock he come from a different
[46:50] amen he he was he was looking after the
[46:53] natural Abraham was looking after the
[46:55] promise of God God and I say today
[46:57] that's what separates Church natural
[46:59] from church spiritual amen one is
[47:01] looking at the natural but God has
[47:04] called you and enlightened your eyes to
[47:06] see the supernatural amen yes Abraham
[47:10] was living under a promise he was
[47:14] looking at the
[47:16] Unseen amen and and and you know he
[47:19] wasn't concerned about lot because he
[47:21] knew he was going to possess it all
[47:23] anyways he wasn't concerned about all
[47:26] the all the prestige that lot was going
[47:28] in amen lot's you know so lot's motives
[47:31] was I will take Abraham's motiv was I
[47:34] will give hallelujah amen you see lot
[47:37] going after the ease Abraham chose to
[47:40] stand with the word of God in in the
[47:43] hardships but God came through once lot
[47:47] is finished lot is finished but
[47:49] Abraham's promise was sure secure to his
[47:54] seed well bless the Lord amen Sodom
[47:59] could not take away the faith of Abraham
[48:02] Sodom could not take the faith out of
[48:05] Abraham's seed and I want to say today
[48:08] that the promises of God that get that
[48:12] that fell on the day of Pentecost is
[48:14] still the same promise that God has for
[48:18] you today amen it's the same promise it
[48:22] whatever whatever Pentecost had at the
[48:24] beginning is the promise that you have
[48:26] today now now now we've gone through a
[48:29] Wilderness experience we amen Israel
[48:32] went through 470 years of of uh amen you
[48:36] know you know as they when they come up
[48:37] to kades Baria when God is talking to
[48:40] Joshua there it had been 470 years since
[48:44] the time that God had revealed himself
[48:46] unto Abraham it was it was 470 years
[48:50] amen and since that time now God had
[48:52] already give the land in between that
[48:55] time now they've went into slavery they
[48:58] they amen they dwelt in another land
[49:01] they they they they were not possessors
[49:03] but the time come that God says I'm
[49:07] going to take you back to that original
[49:11] can you say amen and it's been 2,000
[49:14] years since that original Pentecost
[49:17] since the since the power of the Holy
[49:19] Spirit fell back there in the book of
[49:21] Acts but the promise has been that you
[49:25] are coming back to that original that's
[49:29] what restoration is all
[49:31] about hallelujah amen now if I drop that
[49:36] if I drop that Bible on the floor in
[49:38] order to restore it amen I've got to
[49:41] pick it back up I cannot pick up another
[49:44] book and say this is restoration amen
[49:47] this is replacement this in order to
[49:51] restore I have to pick up the original
[49:55] and and go back well bless the name of
[49:57] the Lord and God didn't say I'm going to
[49:59] give you a replacement he says I'm going
[50:02] to give you the original I'm taking you
[50:06] back to that original experience that
[50:08] original Pentecost that original promise
[50:12] that I gave at the very
[50:15] beginning amen well praise the Lord amen
[50:18] and so if Abraham was told every place
[50:21] the SES of your feet shall trod you
[50:23] shall you you shall have amen then when
[50:26] God appeared unto unto uh uh uh Joshua
[50:30] there as we just read he told him the
[50:32] same thing every place you go the
[50:36] promise is still yours no man shall
[50:38] stand before you nothing shall stand
[50:41] against you you shall possess because
[50:45] the promise is still
[50:48] true Hallelujah the promise is still
[50:51] true it was time to go back somebody say
[50:54] it's time to go back
[50:56] amen Moses had brought them out of Egypt
[50:59] and they had gone through the Wilderness
[51:00] and and God had delivered them you know
[51:02] a mighty hand and and despite Egypt
[51:05] being you know the greatest nation on
[51:07] the earth and though the king had the
[51:10] best of the militaries and though amen
[51:12] it seemed like it was utterly impossible
[51:16] yet the kingdoms of this world could not
[51:20] call back the promise that God had given
[51:24] unto Abraham amen at the very beginning
[51:27] can you say Amen so it's to Abraham and
[51:30] to Abraham's seed that the promise was
[51:34] given to amen now I want you to look at
[51:37] that Hallelujah now now now there the
[51:40] the Bible even talks about you
[51:43] know Paul talked about Pharaoh amen and
[51:47] and he says Amen in the ninth chapter
[51:49] 20th verse and we're just going to break
[51:51] in here amen when he's talking about the
[51:53] king he says NE but oh man who art thou
[51:56] that repliest against God shall the
[51:58] thing form say to him that formed it why
[52:01] hast Thou made me thus can you say Amen
[52:04] so so so Pharaoh no matter how how much
[52:07] he had no matter how great an army no
[52:10] matter how great a nation if God gives a
[52:14] promise God Is Bigger Than Pharaoh God
[52:18] Is Bigger Than deception God Is Bigger
[52:21] Than sin God Is Bigger Than sickness God
[52:24] Is Bigger
[52:25] Leia God Is Bigger when God is ready to
[52:30] take you back to where you
[52:35] belong I want to say in this day of
[52:37] restoration there is no devil that can
[52:39] keep you out of it there is no power
[52:41] that can keep you away from it you are
[52:43] the chosen of God you're the ordained of
[52:46] God there is no sin there is no sickness
[52:49] there is no power there's no
[52:51] principalities that can separate you
[52:54] from the power of that Divine
[52:57] promise now Israel had been in the
[53:00] wilderness for 40 years now now they had
[53:03] been going around in circles amen
[53:06] despite God's manifold Miracles a and
[53:09] blessings just as the church has been
[53:11] going around now amen we've we we've
[53:14] gone around the mountain of
[53:15] justification and sanctification and
[53:18] amen we've gone around we've been in and
[53:20] out amen you know struggling to believe
[53:23] and amen and and and and despite
[53:25] everything that God has done through the
[53:27] history of the church it it seems like
[53:30] amen that that that the chanity has has
[53:33] just got to the point where they they
[53:35] just can't believe they amen they want
[53:37] to believe they they want to overcome
[53:39] they they want to conquer the mountain
[53:41] they amen but there's just something in
[53:44] them that's not going to allow them to
[53:46] come all the way back to God's word but
[53:48] but that's not you that's not the elect
[53:51] God has called you to possess
[53:55] now God wouldn't call you to possess if
[53:57] he didn't give you a faith to overcome
[53:59] God wouldn't call you Amen to rise up
[54:02] above it God wouldn't call you and tell
[54:04] you to go across that Jordan and tell
[54:06] you to go kill those Giants and tell you
[54:08] to go do those things if he was not
[54:10] going to anoint you with his holy spirit
[54:13] to do it you're no match for the devil
[54:16] you're no match for this end time but I
[54:18] want to tell you the devil is no match
[54:21] for the power of God that is anointing
[54:24] this Bri
[54:26] the devil is no match for the power of
[54:30] God that rests on the inside of your
[54:33] bosom can you say amen amen I want you
[54:36] to understand unbelief is actually
[54:38] Rebellion against the word of God when
[54:41] God's word says go and unbelief says I
[54:44] can't for you to sit there in that
[54:46] unbelief and say the Giants are too
[54:48] great amen we're not able to take the
[54:51] land is to rebel against the word of God
[54:54] I say tonight there's got or this
[54:56] morning there's got to be a Joshua
[54:58] there's got to be a Caleb that'll stand
[55:01] up and say give me my
[55:04] Mountain well glory to God I feel like
[55:08] possessing mountains this morning I I
[55:11] feel like taking over all of the all of
[55:13] the stuff that the enemy is squatting on

[1:22:05] right the Bible says Caleb was of a
[1:22:08] different Spirit yes sir Caleb was of a

[1:23:04] amen and sometimes I don't feel like

[1:23:11] upon the word of God and believe that
[1:23:14] promise regardless and stand upon that

[1:28:44] ears for they hear for verily I say unto

[1:28:49] have desired to see those things which

[1:29:29] hold you too much longer this morning
[1:29:32] this is this just just sort of preaching
[1:29:33] my my my heart for a few moments
[1:29:36] and but you
[1:29:38] look look in the old look look look past
[1:29:41] this day let's go beyond brother
[1:29:43] brandham and let's let's let's look
[1:29:47] Beyond look in the
[1:29:50] history there was Smith Wigglesworth a
[1:29:54] man that people look to there were there
[1:29:58] there were great men the Billy Sundays
[1:30:01] there were uh uh uh Knox and and and
[1:30:05] these these these great great men of
[1:30:08] Faith but it was sporadic because the
[1:30:12] Holy Spirit could not
[1:30:15] rest on the church as a
[1:30:18] whole God would raise up certain men
[1:30:21] with that were
[1:30:24] gifted but in the last day God didn't
[1:30:27] just Raise Up A Gifted Man he sent
[1:30:31] us a
[1:30:34] Joshua to position Us in that
[1:30:39] land so that well praise the Lord in the
[1:30:44] wilderness there was only a few gifted
[1:30:47] men that would come in amen there was
[1:30:50] there were 70 that were anointed to
[1:30:52] prophesy there and they helped with
[1:30:54] Moses right yes sir and there was all
[1:30:57] the bickering and all the fusting and
[1:30:59] all the fighting all through that that
[1:31:01] the Wilderness all in that church amen
[1:31:05] hallelujah but Joshua came to put the
[1:31:09] people on their land so that they could
[1:31:13] possess their promise so that they could
[1:31:16] take their
[1:31:17] Mountain so they could build their house
[1:31:22] oh come on church amen and so it has
[1:31:26] been All Through the Ages we've had
[1:31:28] great men rise up and they were
[1:31:30] wonderful but our Prophet did not come
[1:31:32] to pull to himself the gift of God came
[1:31:35] in his life to get the people's
[1:31:37] attention so that they would believe him
[1:31:40] that's right the angel says if you can
[1:31:42] get the people to believe you nothing
[1:31:44] will stand before your prayer not even
[1:31:46] cancer he said there's going to be the
[1:31:48] first pool it's going to be healing
[1:31:50] there's going to be the second pool pull
[1:31:52] it's going to be discernment all right
[1:31:54] but then there's going to be a third
[1:31:55] pull and it's going to be the bride's
[1:31:57] inheritance the first pull was William
[1:31:59] bram's gift second poll was William
[1:32:02] bram's gift amen that's never been
[1:32:04] promised to you but in that third poll

[1:32:23] first pull and a second pull that ain't
[1:32:25] my yet that you you can gimmick that
[1:32:27] that's what they tried to do outside
[1:32:29] there they tried to gimick
[1:32:31] it man trying to hold the hand old
[1:32:34] Roberts had power in his right hand and
[1:32:36] then there was everybody had all these
[1:32:37] Powers everyone was looking to men that
[1:32:40] wasn't the purpose the purpose was not
[1:32:43] to look at William brandham yes God was
[1:32:46] with him and gave him those two pulls so
[1:32:49] that the world would know that God was
[1:32:51] with him

[1:37:15] saying but you see but you see I I don't
