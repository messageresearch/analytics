[38:05] and but Ezekiel 22 and
[38:09] 28 it says her prophets have dobbed them
[38:12] with untempered mortar seeing vanity
[38:17] divining lies unto them and saying thus
[38:20] saith the Lord God when the Lord hath
[38:23] not spoken the people of the land have
[38:26] used oppress
[38:28] exercised
[38:30] robbery vexed the poor and needy they
[38:34] have oppressed The Stranger
[38:36] wrongfully I sought a
[38:38] man sought for a man among them that
[38:41] should make up the Hedge and stand in
[38:43] the gap before me for the land that I
[38:46] should not destroy it but I found
[38:50] none and then I'd also like to read um
[38:53] here in in Romans the 12th chapter I
[38:56] quoted it this
[38:58] morning and um but Romans 12:1 very
[39:01] familiar passage of
[39:03] scripture and
[39:12] um it says I beseech you therefore

[39:19] present your bodies a Living
[39:21] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[39:25] is your reasonable service and be not
[39:28] conformed to this world but be ye

[40:49] seated
[40:52] so for this communion service here
[40:54] tonight I
[40:55] thought I'd i' like to uh speak on the
[41:00] intercessor and
[41:03] um
[41:04] um there in the Book of Matthew the the
[41:08] 25th
[41:11] chapter um brother or or Jesus is is
[41:14] talking about um the kingdom of heaven
[41:18] and and how that there will be
[41:22] um uh there Matthew 25 and
[41:25] 31 and he and he and he talks about how
[41:28] it says when the son of man shall come
[41:31] in his glory and all the Holy Angels
[41:35] with him then he shall set upon the
[41:37] throne of his glory and before him shall
[41:40] be gathered all nations and he shall
[41:43] separate them one from another as a
[41:46] Shepherd divideth his sheep's sheep from
[41:48] the goats and he shall set the sheep on
[41:51] his right hand and the goats on the
[41:54] left then shall the king say unto them
[41:57] on his right Come Ye blessed of my
[42:00] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[42:03] you from the foundation of the world for
[42:06] I was hungered and you gave me meat I
[42:10] was thirsty you gave me drink I was a
[42:15] stranger you took me in naked and you
[42:19] clothed me I was sick and you visited me
[42:24] I was in prison and you came unto me
[42:28] then shall the righteous answer him
[42:30] saying Lord when saw we thee hungered
[42:35] and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee
[42:40] drink when when saw we thee a stranger
[42:43] and took thee
[42:45] in or naked and clothed thee or when saw
[42:50] we thee sick or in prison and came unto
[42:54] thee and the King shall answer and say
[42:56] unto to them verily I say unto you in as
[43:00] much as you have done it unto the least
[43:03] of these my brethren ye have done it
[43:06] unto me then shall he say also unto them
[43:10] on his left hand depart from me you
[43:13] cursed into Everlasting fire and
[43:17] prepared for the devil and his angels
[43:20] for I was hunger and you gave me no meat
[43:23] I was thirsty and you gave me no drink
[43:27] I was a stranger and you took me not in
[43:31] naked and you clothed me not sick and in
[43:36] prison and you visited me not then they
[43:40] shall they also answer saying Lord when
[43:44] saw we thee hungered or a thirst or a
[43:48] stranger or naked or sick or in prison
[43:54] and did not Minister unto thee then
[43:57] shall he answer unto them verily I say
[43:59] unto you in as much as ye did it not to
[44:04] one of the least of these you did it not
[44:07] unto me and these shall go away into
[44:10] Everlasting punishment but the righteous
[44:13] unto life
[44:15] eternal
[44:18] now that is quite a sober
[44:21] reading we know
[44:24] that
[44:25] in the Church ages of course brother
[44:28] brandham would um apply this scripture
[44:33] to uh uses this scripture to apply to to
[44:37] those who are good to the
[44:39] bride and um and so he he he
[44:44] shares um how that when you that the
[44:48] bride of Christ that carries the
[44:50] genetics of God within them they're so
[44:53] valuable to God that in when some
[44:57] someone loves his people and and and and
[45:03] takes care of his people it is the same
[45:06] thing as doing it as as to
[45:09] himself amen and and then those that do
[45:14] not value God's people the elect of God
[45:18] they then they um would would go into
[45:23] they they would go on to hell
[45:27] but brother Brandon would also he would
[45:29] also
[45:30] bring um this in to the bride and says
[45:36] that this is a natural
[45:39] quality for the elect of God because the
[45:43] New
[45:44] Birth the new birth gives you the heart
[45:49] of an intercessor okay and so as we as
[45:53] we think about the man that or the
[45:56] scripture that we read I sought for a
[45:58] man among them that would make up the
[46:00] Hedge and stand in the gap before me for
[46:04] the Lord for the land that I should not
[46:07] destroy it and and he says I didn't find
[46:10] any I I didn't find any now in in the
[46:14] Old Testament times of course amen there
[46:16] was no one with that new birth and so as
[46:20] we as we go into communion tonight I I
[46:23] want us to look at this because the
[46:25] awesome the the
[46:28] awesome call to be a priest we were the
[46:32] the there was there was no one allowed
[46:35] to be a priest unless you were part of
[46:37] the children of Aaron amen you couldn't
[46:40] be a priest of the Old Testament not
[46:42] anybody could just come in and and act
[46:45] as an intercessor before the Lord it was
[46:48] only it was only the the Aaron's sons
[46:53] that could go in the Levites that could
[46:57] take the blood offer the blood amen and
[47:01] and and and and go through the the
[47:04] Brazen altar the Brazen labor come
[47:07] before the the altar of incense and then
[47:11] finally into the presence of God it was
[47:15] it was it was only a chosen certain uh
[47:20] uh sack that was able to go there and
[47:22] only the high priest could go into the
[47:25] presence of the Lord amen behind that
[47:28] inner veil in that in that third Veil
[47:31] and so but when Jesus died amen he paid
[47:35] the way he paved the way as the great
[47:39] intercessor to go Beyond the Veil and
[47:42] when he went beyond the veil he also
[47:45] tore down that Veil he didn't just go
[47:48] Beyond the Veil and let it fall behind
[47:50] him but he tore the Veil Down and he has
[47:53] invited all of the sons of God to come
[47:57] into the presence of God hallelu now the
[48:00] the Old Testament was a type of the
[48:03] priests of the New Testament amen you
[48:06] you had to go amen through the through
[48:09] the offering of the blood and then you
[48:11] had to go through the sanctification of
[48:13] of the amen the the the the Brazen uh
[48:17] labor there where where you're washed
[48:19] with the cleansing of the word and then
[48:22] you then you were to go on in to that
[48:25] that most holy place
[48:27] and there is is right there at that most
[48:29] holy place is where you would alter
[48:32] where you would offer the the prayer of
[48:35] incense you would you would come as
[48:38] you're walking in to that most holy
[48:41] place that third part that place where
[48:43] God was at the place where the where
[48:44] where the Ark of the Covenant was at the
[48:46] place where the mercy seat was at amen
[48:48] where the where the pillar of fire dwelt
[48:51] among it a or Over The Mercy Seat there
[48:55] is where amen you would offer as a
[48:59] priest you would offer prayers unto the
[49:02] Lord and and they were required to burn
[49:05] incense and it was it was called they
[49:08] they God gave them the exact of of what
[49:11] they were to to burn and it was to be a
[49:14] a sweet odor unto the Lord and as they
[49:18] come into the presence of the Lord they
[49:21] he had to go in with prayer and and and
[49:25] walking through that Veil
[49:27] amen with this incense and amen it was a
[49:31] it was a type of of you and me being
[49:35] able to come through our Sanctified
[49:38] lives our lives that have that have that
[49:42] have been laid upon the altar amen our
[49:45] Humanity as you will amen has has has
[49:49] has been put aside the Apostle Paul says
[49:52] I I I amen he says I I I I I've died but
[49:56] yet live and and to walk in there and
[50:00] and now we are we there is something
[50:04] about you you've been through the blood
[50:07] you've been Sanctified by the word and
[50:10] now you're just now beginning to fulfill
[50:14] the purpose for doing it all and that's
[50:18] to come in the presence of God Amen to
[50:22] walk in there to intercede for the
[50:25] people
[50:26] you've went through the process you've
[50:29] done the whole thing because God wanted
[50:32] you to come into His
[50:33] presence now I I want you to really
[50:36] think about that
[50:38] because amen there there is a a a reason
[50:43] that God has has called you you know he
[50:46] says that you're going to be Kings and
[50:48] Priests they're they're in in in
[50:50] Revelations one amen that he has he has
[50:54] made us Kings and Priests and and and
[50:57] and and brother brandham would tell us
[50:59] he says now he says now there a lot of
[51:01] people want to make this for the future
[51:03] amen and and he says he hath made us
[51:07] there there are certain truths we got to
[51:09] emphasize this is one of them he he hath
[51:12] made us salvation is his doing salvation
[51:14] is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed
[51:17] us for a purpose he bought us for a
[51:20] purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh
[51:23] we are going to be Kings on the earth
[51:25] with him when he sets on throne but now
[51:28] are we spiritual Kings and we Reign Over
[51:31] a spiritual Kingdom amen and how do we
[51:35] do this the uh the uh the Apostle Paul
[51:38] there in in Romans 5 and 17 for by one
[51:41] man's offense death reigned by one much
[51:45] more they which have received the
[51:47] abundance of grace and the gift of
[51:48] righteousness shall reign in life uh
[51:52] shall we reign in life by one Jesus
[51:55] Christ we've been translated from the
[51:57] kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
[51:59] his light we have we we have taken on we
[52:03] have taken on his name we have taken on
[52:06] his his
[52:08] characteristics so right now we reign
[52:10] with Christ having dominion over sin
[52:14] over the world over the Flesh and over
[52:17] the devil now he says that he says just
[52:20] the way I just I just quoted it having
[52:22] dominion over sin the World the Flesh
[52:26] and the devil now why would he give you
[52:30] authority over that because through the
[52:33] blood of Jesus Christ at the Brazen
[52:36] Altar and the and and and the the word
[52:40] that Bloody bleeding word at the labor
[52:43] amen it has prepared you it has brought
[52:47] you you have sin is under your control
[52:52] sin is under your feet you have taken in
[52:56] the blood of Jesus and you have put
[52:59] those things and and you have you have
[53:01] you have put yourself you have you have
[53:05] died to yourself and you're living aresh
[53:08] to the Lord Jesus Christ I want to say
[53:11] that's the only way that you're ever
[53:12] going Amen to be a a real intercessor
[53:15] because you can't really feel amen now
[53:19] God God's allowed us to be humans and
[53:22] and and in our Humanity we do feel amen
[53:27] and and and that's what Humanity do I I
[53:29] I think Humanity should feel for
[53:32] Humanity there there should be a love
[53:35] there should be a compassion for
[53:37] Humanity to humanity and as I said this
[53:40] morning brother Bram talked about how
[53:42] that the the the love of many shall wax
[53:45] long a cold uh uh because of the
[53:48] abounding of iniquity and and these
[53:51] things would take us totally away uh uh
[53:54] from our genuine purpose but you you see
[53:56] he's made us didn't just make us a king
[54:00] and he didn't just make us a priest he
[54:03] made us a king to bring this flesh under
[54:06] the control and he's also made us
[54:09] priests to be able to walk into the
[54:12] presence of God and intercede for his
[54:15] people I I want to say tonight there is
[54:18] nothing any greater there is nothing any
[54:23] greater than an
[54:25] intercessor right right you you you
[54:29] can you can you've got the
[54:33] accusers you you you've got to amen and
[54:37] someone had asked me here here here some
[54:39] time back and and uh uh they they said
[54:43] we we we want you to you know something
[54:45] was going on and and and we and we you
[54:49] know drunk ladies trying to run over her
[54:51] boyfriend and and uh you know and and um
[54:55] I I you know the the the the police was
[54:58] wanting me to sign something and I I I I
[55:00] I said listen I I don't want to be the
[55:03] accuser I'm I'm wanting to stand he goes
[55:06] Mr Martin amen and and I understand
[55:11] sometimes we got to do those things but
[55:13] but my but my point is this God has not
[55:17] called us to bring judgment God has
[55:20] called us to give
[55:23] Mercy God's not now I know God's a god
[55:25] of judgment but he's not made me the
[55:27] judge that's right he's made me a king
[55:31] over this
[55:33] flesh and he's made me a priest for his
[55:37] people he's the judge he's the only
[55:41] judge he's the one we're going to stand
[55:44] before you're not going to stand before
[55:46] me I'm not going to stand before you we
[55:48] will stand before him somay but right
[55:51] now we're reigning over a spiritual
[55:53] Kingdom he has anointed us Amen to bring
[55:57] in under again what was it to to to
[56:01] bring to bring dominion over sin and
[56:05] this flesh a a and the devil Amen to
[56:08] bring that in and that is what God has
[56:11] called us to do amen over sin the World
[56:15] the Flesh and the devil amen so tonight
[56:19] you'll never be a successful
[56:22] priest until you become a successful
[56:25] King
[56:27] you'll never be a good
[56:30] intercessor until you bring sin under
[56:33] your control the world in your life your
[56:36] flesh and the devil under control can
[56:39] you say amen amen how are we to do that
[56:44] through the opening of the word the
[56:45] judge has handed you the book that you
[56:49] must live by and as kings you don't have
[56:52] your own you don't have your own laws
[56:56] amen the great one Among Us has given us
[56:59] the laws and we've got to carry that out
[57:02] can you say Amen aren't you glad that
[57:04] you've been translated into his glorious
[57:08] Kingdom
[57:10] amen amen priest he hath made us Kings
[57:13] and Priests unto God and his father Amen
[57:18] brother brother bradam would say as
[57:20] we've read in the church age book he
[57:22] says made us priest yes priests unto him
[57:26] offering spiritual Praise of Sanctified
[57:29] lips spending our lives as a sweet
[57:32] offering unto him worshiping him in
[57:35] spirit and in truth
[57:38] interceding and petitioning priests and
[57:41] Kings unto our God another place he says
[57:45] has made us priest did you ever know
[57:46] what a priest uh what a priest is what
[57:49] is his office a priest is to make
[57:52] sacrifice to make intercession amen amen
[57:57] so as we as we look tonight amen I I I I
[58:02] want us to really stop to think about
[58:04] what this Blood Covenant means to us
[58:07] brother bradam on that day at Calvary he
[58:10] says I hope this helps you get in a
[58:12] place that's what the Tabernacle that's
[58:15] what all people has got to do is to find
[58:17] out what you are and what's the purpose
[58:21] Church isn't going to church just to
[58:23] play music sing songs church is a place
[58:26] where correction judgment begins at the
[58:28] house of God we must reckon ourselves
[58:31] dead and alive to
[58:33] Christ then he made the way that we
[58:37] could sacrifice ourselves to his service
[58:41] yes to follow him and if we follow him
[58:46] we lead the life that he lived and then
[58:50] he says that's wonderful he said Jesus
[58:53] said spoke of it
[58:56] he said let let let me give you a few
[58:58] quotations on it he said listen close
[59:00] don't miss it Jesus said at that day he
[59:04] would separate the people like the sheep
[59:06] and the goats and he would say to the
[59:08] goats stand on the left side and to the
[59:10] Sheep stand on the right side he said to
[59:13] the goats depart from me because I was
[59:15] hungry and you didn't feed me and I was
[59:17] in prison and you did not uh uh visit me
[59:20] I was naked and you clothed me not I was
[59:23] thirsty you gave me no drink I was sick
[59:26] and you didn't visit me so depart from
[59:28] me but on the sheep he said I was hungry
[59:32] and you fed me and I was naked and you
[59:33] clothed me I was sick and you ministered
[59:36] to me now notice don't fail to get this
[59:39] church keep this in your heart
[59:43] forever it was so unconsciously done
[59:48] people don't do it for the line of duty
[59:51] a man that gives you something
[59:54] another he because he ought to do it a
[59:57] man that feeds you because he ought to
[59:59] do it well he's got a selfish idea it
[1:00:02] should be your very life your very
[1:00:07] action it was so surprising to these
[1:00:10] sheep that they said Lord when when were
[1:00:13] you hungry and we fed you when were you
[1:00:15] naked and you and and and we clothed you
[1:00:18] when were you thirsty and we gave you
[1:00:21] drink when were you sick and we
[1:00:22] ministered to you it was so automatic
[1:00:26] out of love just your life lived in them
[1:00:30] God let the people see what calary has
[1:00:35] did for
[1:00:36] us so
[1:00:38] automatically when were you Lord we
[1:00:41] never knew Look what Jesus turned and
[1:00:44] said in so much as youve done it unto
[1:00:48] these you did it unto
[1:00:51] me you see I I I believe God keeps
[1:00:55] record
[1:00:56] I believe God
[1:00:58] appreciates every priest that cares
[1:01:02] enough to leave their to leave their
[1:01:05] life and to walk into his presence and
[1:01:08] to do and to consecrate themselves and
[1:01:10] to go amen through that process to go
[1:01:13] into the to intercede for another man or
[1:01:16] woman you want the blessings of the
[1:01:19] Lord you want God to smile on
[1:01:24] you than love his
[1:01:29] people you want you want then humble
[1:01:33] yourself and abase yourself in such a
[1:01:36] way where all you want to see is the
[1:01:38] kingdom of God go
[1:01:40] forward and that kind of a
[1:01:43] life is the very thing that ushered the
[1:01:48] the the high priest into the presence of
[1:01:51] the
[1:01:53] Lord they had they had laid themselves
[1:01:55] was on that altar that lamb had took
[1:01:58] their place and they amen all of their
[1:02:01] sins were down they had taken that
[1:02:04] Brazen labor and they they had washed
[1:02:06] themselves with the washing of the water
[1:02:09] of the word and now they're coming in
[1:02:12] with this incense of
[1:02:14] prayer what a beautiful thing see God's
[1:02:18] not called us to just come and said in a

[1:02:39] priests because a priest has got to walk
[1:02:43] humbly a priest
[1:02:47] isn't a a priest is is one that is had
[1:02:52] to walk the priest had to be dressed
[1:02:54] right the priest had to amen he had to
[1:02:59] go through the consecration he had to go
[1:03:01] through all of these things before he
[1:03:03] could even amen even come in and and and
[1:03:07] and begin to
[1:03:09] intercede and it's quite a challenge
[1:03:11] it's quite you you've got to it's it's a
[1:03:14] it's a Sanctified life that you have to
[1:03:16] live can you say Amen now brother

[1:03:30] the things of the world and so alive in
[1:03:33] Christ so walking on the highway that
[1:03:36] these things are just automatic thing
[1:03:38] you just do it not saying well now the
[1:03:41] Lord would uh uh uh now the the Lord
[1:03:44] would Lord want me to do that that's not
[1:03:47] it you're just part of him his spirit is
[1:03:52] in you and you act the way that he acts
[1:03:55] act it and then he goes ah do you get it
[1:04:00] there's a way that seeth right unto a
[1:04:01] man but the end thereof is death but not
[1:04:04] all that saith Lord Lord shall enter in
[1:04:06] but they that do the will of the father
[1:04:09] just from their hearts just freely now

[1:12:48] right is doing just so automatically
[1:12:51] dead in Christ till you do it anyhow
[1:12:53] it's your nature it's your makeup you do
[1:12:55] it anyhow it's just the life that has
[1:12:58] lived in you you you're completely
[1:13:01] yielded to that spirit and it just lives
[1:13:04] its life in
[1:13:05] you or you feel the Blessed spirit that
[1:13:09] life not me that liveth but but said
[1:13:12] Paul but Christ lives in me it's just so
[1:13:15] automatic well I tell you brother
[1:13:17] brandom we we are Christians here we we
[1:13:19] help these people we help them people we
[1:13:22] he says oh my shame on you that's not
[1:13:24] Christianity
[1:13:26] Christianity just automatically got to
[1:13:30] it's to be done you just forgot about it
[1:13:33] all about it I I ain't I ain't got
[1:13:35] nothing just go do it Christ just
[1:13:37] completely surrendered himself his life
[1:13:40] to God he made he gave himself a public
[1:13:44] servant to the people he gave his life
[1:13:46] freely he didn't have to do it he didn't
[1:13:50] begrudging do it he didn't say now
[1:13:53] Brethren you all ought to think a whole
[1:13:55] lot of me because I come to die for you
[1:13:59] he never said a word about it and he
[1:14:02] died anyhow because it was God in him
[1:14:06] it's God in you it's god in me that
[1:14:10] makes us look at others sheep on one
[1:14:13] side can you say Amen one of them will
[1:14:16] say well Lord I did this and Lord I did
[1:14:18] that he said depart from me you workers
[1:14:21] of iniquity I never even knew you if the
[1:14:24] church can never come to these
[1:14:25] fundamental facts that it's not
[1:14:28] something you try to do you work
[1:14:30] yourself up to do it's something that's
[1:14:32] born in
[1:14:34] you well praise the Lord do you love
[1:14:38] him
[1:14:40] amen another place is but you have left
[1:14:43] the great things undone it's that
[1:14:46] self-sacrificed life that God lives in
[1:14:48] you automatically doing that which is
[1:14:51] right because it's right just going on
[1:14:54] don't even think nothing about about it
[1:14:55] just living it then once you see what's
[1:14:58] going on see you just you don't you're
[1:15:01] you're on the highway that's that's what
[1:15:03] Calvary meant to you you're on the
[1:15:05] highway opened up that day for you now
[1:15:08] remember you can't be half goat and half
[1:15:10] sheep they won't mix now there's a lot
[1:15:13] of people say yes you know what we we
[1:15:16] got an organization our group we got a
[1:15:18] we we we help the pure we do this we
[1:15:20] that's all right but you're tooting your
[1:15:22] own horn about it you you don't do that
[1:15:26] oh you you you do your arms in in secret
[1:15:29] Jesus said just automatically something
[1:15:31] no more than going getting a drink of
[1:15:33] water you're thirsty if the next man is
[1:15:35] thirsty you think about him too the next
[1:15:38] man's need you think about about him the
[1:15:40] same as you think about you for your own
[1:15:43] need don't pay no attention to it you
[1:15:46] just live on you can't be half sheep and
[1:15:49] half goat so if you say well our church
[1:15:52] is a has got an organization we give to
[1:15:54] the poor we do this and we do that and
[1:15:56] we do the other if you have that without
[1:15:58] the other The Life of Christ in you
[1:16:01] you're just going and doing you're just
[1:16:04] absolutely doing it in
[1:16:07] vain can you say
[1:16:10] Amen so what he's trying to say there's
[1:16:13] going to be somebody of another
[1:16:16] priesthood that would
[1:16:18] try to do things and their approach to
[1:16:21] God and and try their own way
[1:16:25] of of of working for the
[1:16:29] Lord but brother brandom is saying only
[1:16:32] the elect the elect and that's what
[1:16:33] that's what all of the churches that
[1:16:35] they want a big they they want the big
[1:16:36] name they want the big titles they want
[1:16:38] the big they they they they they want
[1:16:40] the big churches they want these things
[1:16:41] they want that but not the Bride of
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:46] wants to come to that Altar and have
[1:16:49] their nature changed have that blood
[1:16:52] offering applied to them and what their
[1:16:55] sins and take the word amen and bring
[1:16:58] that word over them and wash them and
[1:17:00] cleanse them so that they can come into
[1:17:03] the presence of God that's the only one
[1:17:07] coming into his
[1:17:09] presence it's not in great
[1:17:13] minds it's not how smart how
[1:17:18] rich not how good looking how many
[1:17:21] girlfriends you
[1:17:23] have it's not how many amen trophies
[1:17:27] dear trophies you have on your
[1:17:31] wall it's you coming and taking
[1:17:34] Calvary and letting Calvary make a
[1:17:37] difference in your
[1:17:38] life it's letting Calvary make a
[1:17:42] difference and making you like
[1:17:51] him I'm not going to be that judge on
[1:17:54] that
[1:17:56] day I'm not going to be the one that's
[1:17:59] going to be the goats and the Sheep
[1:18:00] that's not my
[1:18:03] job my
[1:18:05] job is to be a
[1:18:09] priest your
[1:18:11] job is to be a priest a priest unto him
[1:18:16] yes and I say there's a lot of needy
[1:18:18] that needs
[1:18:20] priest Josh is not in the it's not in
[1:18:23] it's not in how good you preach you're a
[1:18:26] priest you're an
[1:18:31] intercessor it's not how good you sing
[1:18:34] it's not how good you

[1:18:40] belong on the Deacon board or belong on
[1:18:41] the trustee board whether you you belong
[1:18:44] on the you know you're you're a you're a
[1:18:46] part of the five-fold ministry or the
[1:18:47] helps of the governments or whether
[1:18:48] you're a it don't matter
[1:18:55] one thing that
[1:18:57] matters is let
[1:19:00] me be an
[1:19:03] intercessor can you say
[1:19:06] Amen now as we come into this part of
[1:19:12] the service as we take the
[1:19:16] bread and and we look at it here in in
[1:19:21] the book of
[1:19:25] 1 Corinthians the 11th
[1:19:28] chapter and
[1:19:30] we we we we look at this and
[1:19:34] and and the Apostle
[1:19:39] Paul is not taking the sheep and the
[1:19:42] goats but he's but he's but he's taking
[1:19:45] the same lines that brother bradam said
[1:19:48] listen you're coming
[1:19:50] together and it's for the worst and not
[1:19:53] the good
[1:19:55] you're vying for positions you're vying
[1:19:58] for this and that and you have failed to
[1:20:03] realize that you're
[1:20:06] part of a body of
[1:20:08] Christ now let's look at
[1:20:11] this for I the uh uh 1 Corinthians 11
[1:20:15] and
[1:20:17] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[1:20:19] which also I delivered unto
[1:20:22] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:20:24] in which he was betrayed took
[1:20:27] bread when he had given thanks he broke
[1:20:30] it and said
[1:20:33] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:20:38] for you do this in remembrance of
[1:20:41] me after the same manner also he took
[1:20:43] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:20:47] in my new testament is the is the New
[1:20:50] Testament in my
[1:20:51] blood this
[1:20:53] do as often often as you drink it in
[1:20:55] remembrance of me for as for as often as
[1:20:59] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:21:03] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:21:05] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:21:08] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:21:12] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:21:14] and blood of the Lord let a man examine
[1:21:18] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:21:20] and drink of that cup he that eateth and
[1:21:23] drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh
[1:21:25] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:21:29] Lord's body for this calls many are weak
[1:21:32] and sickly among you and many sleep but
[1:21:35] if you would
[1:21:36] judge our if we would judge
[1:21:39] ourselves we should not be
[1:21:42] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:21:44] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:21:47] be condemned with the
[1:21:48] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:21:51] come together to eat carry for one
[1:21:55] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:21:58] meat at home that ye come not unto
[1:22:02] condemnation the rest I will set in
[1:22:04] order when I
[1:22:07] come as we look at this portion of the
[1:22:13] service the blood and
[1:22:17] I I'm thankful for that
[1:22:21] blood I'm thankful for the the Great
[1:22:24] great
[1:22:26] intercessor the great
[1:22:28] intercessor gave his
[1:22:31] life he shed his blood he laid down his
[1:22:35] bread Jesus said this this bread amen is
[1:22:40] my
[1:22:41] body it's a type of that word that has
[1:22:45] become
[1:22:46] flesh this wine is my blood that was
[1:22:51] spilled so he ultimately
[1:22:54] laid down his
[1:22:56] life so that you and I IM man could come
[1:23:02] before the Lord
[1:23:07] that's it it it it gets me every time I
[1:23:11] think about
[1:23:12] it
[1:23:13] he put his world on
[1:23:17] hold to come down live with
[1:23:21] me find me in my
[1:23:26] stench and he was the intercessor
[1:23:29] between me and
[1:23:31] God and brought me into this
[1:23:33] relationship with the
[1:23:36] Lord that's what his blood has done but
[1:23:39] it didn't just do that to where you're
[1:23:41] coming but now he's saying now I'm going
[1:23:45] to make you an
[1:23:47] intercessor I'm I'm going to make you
[1:23:49] you you you're you're you you are now
[1:23:52] going to live for a greater purpose than
[1:23:55] than the purpose of a man just uh uh
[1:24:01] uh going to work every day as I was
[1:24:05] saying this morning you you Brothers can
[1:24:06] feel
[1:24:07] so can feel
[1:24:10] unappreciated and and you sisters can
[1:24:14] can feel that way yourselves and and it
[1:24:17] just seems like it's
[1:24:19] a it's a miracle
[1:24:22] round but God's design is not for you to
[1:24:25] live this way
[1:24:29] forever it's God's design to bring the
[1:24:32] higher purpose out in
[1:24:35] you now I am not in the slightest
[1:24:38] bit hope this ain't a condeming message
[1:24:40] to
[1:24:42] y'all I'm here
[1:24:44] today to finish up my thought from this
[1:24:47] morning be strong and very courageous
[1:24:56] lots of humanity out there but very few
[1:24:58] Sons living in his
[1:25:01] position lots of lots of wonderful
[1:25:04] things out in the world but there's only
[1:25:08] a few that know
[1:25:09] how to come into His
[1:25:13] presence only a few know
[1:25:16] how and I say
[1:25:19] today he's made a
[1:25:22] way he's not looking at at any of our
[1:25:26] sins once they're confessed
[1:25:29] of once they're put under the blood
[1:25:33] that's the reason on
[1:25:34] communion man if if you've got a against
[1:25:38] a
[1:25:38] brother then you should take care of
[1:25:40] that
[1:25:41] odd you should make sure that anything
[1:25:44] that is that that is in between because
[1:25:47] you you you you understand amen that you
[1:25:51] are uh uh uh you you are a uh a a spirit
[1:25:58] being and and and the spirits of this uh
[1:26:03] the sins of this spirit amen it's the
[1:26:05] sins of the spirit man that bring on the
[1:26:08] sins of of of the body it's the desires
[1:26:11] of the spirit that the body enacts it's
[1:26:14] the desires if you've got malice and and
[1:26:17] and and and envying then then it comes
[1:26:20] out through your gossiping if you've got
[1:26:23] hatred in your spirit in your heart then
[1:26:28] then you're going to hate those that are
[1:26:32] outside so whatever is on the outside is
[1:26:37] a reflection of what's on the inside and
[1:26:40] what we are doing is saying we want to
[1:26:43] have our spir not just our flesh clean
[1:26:46] but we want our Spirits clean and pure
[1:26:50] before
[1:26:51] God we want the presence of
[1:26:56] God nothing to hinder us from his
[1:27:00] presence can you say Amen so if that be
[1:27:04] the case if there's if there's odds then
[1:27:07] we go take care of the odds if you've
[1:27:10] got OD against your mom and dad you just
[1:27:12] go take care of
[1:27:15] it if you've been wrong you repent of
[1:27:19] it the blood of
[1:27:22] Jesus takes care of of it all now now
[1:27:25] now there is nothing about this that is
[1:27:26] going to save you this is just a
[1:27:29] memorial but this causes self inspection
[1:27:33] to every one of us it brings us in line
[1:27:36] to say Lord where am I at where am I
[1:27:41] standing right
[1:27:43] here in October of
[1:27:47] 2024 where where where am I at with

[1:29:54] to make us
[1:29:57] pure but Lord this is
