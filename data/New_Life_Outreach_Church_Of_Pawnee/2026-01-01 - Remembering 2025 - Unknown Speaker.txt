[music] Sitting here in your right mind, look back. Who's fed you? Who's [music] clothed YOU WHEN THOSE BRAKES WERE SQUEAKING AND THE CAR ALMOST RAMMED YOU? [music] WHO protected you then? Who was that that hour of sickness when the doctor shook his head and said, "I don't know no more to do, but you're here tonight. [music] Look back a little piece and see what happened.
