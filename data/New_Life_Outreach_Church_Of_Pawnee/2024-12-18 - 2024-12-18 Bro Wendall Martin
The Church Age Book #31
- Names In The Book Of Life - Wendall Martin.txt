deer but U we got a lot of of experience and so I told him I said you know you got something to brag about and the girls are thinking you're tough amen they amen praise the Lord so we appreciate brother Simeon um and then another thing is uh um Naomi is is in delivery and so Mitch and Tabitha are fixing to be grandparents and uh so we're really excited for Aaron and and Naomi and you guys are fixing to be great grandparents again and so uh this is is again is this the first this is going to be the first so we've got they're going to be brand new great grandparents brother Merl hadn't even got that far amen coming up soon though amen and uh so uh we're we're just really really thankful for that uh brother Kobe's already mentioned it but we're so glad to have uh brother Luke back with us you're talking about a you're talking about a tough guy uh he he he shot his his deer you know his first deer this year and um but on top of that all in the same year uh he went out dune buggy riding with a Wallace and um they rode that thing three times and he was in it and he lived to tell the story story and uh so we're how many's glad to have brother Luke back with us tonight had a wonderful time over there and so that's just wonderful all right we won't hold you we won't keep you standing let's let's look here in the Book of Revelations the third chapter and uh and we're going to read the fifth verse how many's been enjoying the um Sardis Church age hasn't that just been wonderful and I I I think you're going to enjoy these next um um few uh lessons because uh you know I I've been telling you all all along that I I love this portion of the church age book and so we're going to get into a portion of that here tonight he says that uh he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you for your amazing love and your great uh Grace Upon Us Lord and we just ask father that you would you would be with us here tonight Lord we've we're there there's a a sense of uh excitement father as sister Naomi is is in delivery and we just pray that you will be with her on her first baby and be with her and the baby and and and brother Aaron Lord just ask father that that it would be an easy delivery Lord and that your blessings and your angels would be all around them we pray Lord that you would be with us here tonight as we as we read the church age book just ask father that you will anoint it let your blessings and your presence be with us Lord you see Dad Lord who's in the hospital ask Lord that you let him know how much we love him and let him let him feel the love there in the room and ask that you would be with him be with all of our elders tonight Lord be with sister Angie just ask Lord that you would be with with all of your people in Jesus name we pray amen and amen you can be seated here today we um we're going to read out of uh 264 and um we're going to start down here on the third paragraph and um so we're going to uh be dealing with the book of life so some people um it gets have you know can be confused um how can your name be on the book of life and and never have it taken off and yet the Bible just said that that there will be names that will come off of The Book of Life and um and so uh for some that that can be a little bit confusing and um but brother brother brandom um he in in the um fa his Works expressed there in 11: 2665 he says you're going to see maybe a little confusion uh there of what I said of the two books of life he says it's the same book but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other one just like a stalk of wheat well now you talk of you talk of me you talk of me as a living person but there's a part of me here is that person that that must perish but that that's the book that the name comes off of but the Eternal one the predestinated one the elected one the name can never uh never can come from there because it was always on it it can never be taken off and so as we as we go into this lesson here tonight we we we should you know really be thankful for God's for election there's no man that would ever be saved no boy girl man or woman that could ever be saved and and even hope to be a part of the pride except the Lord Jesus loved you eternally and he put your name in that Lamb's Book of Life and how there should be a great humility a a a deep humility within every one of us before the Lord in our in our prayer life it should never just be nonchalant you know just coming before God and and and how how we should have a desire greater than we've ever had before as we as as as we're seeing the church ages and seeing God's great plan and how that God is doing everything amen everything that he can throughout all of the ages and vindicating it he puts it in Prophecy and then we can see it and and to to show us in this day this was my plan this is the finality you're my reason and I love you little bride and I'm going to take you home with me I I think I think every church service should be a real Earnest Every Time We Come and sing songs it should be Earnest every time time the preacher is preaching it should be he should preach with earnestness and we should listen with earnestness if every prayer meeting I think I think we should have that burning Zeal with within our hearts and U and so um as we get ready uh page 264 and um uh want to say that it's good to have sister April back with us and uh and that and that young fell right there beside her amen good to good to have y'all um uh back home and uh you know every time that that that you recognize somebody you always miss somebody else out so I'm going to learn to just never say that but it wasn't because I don't like you amen and so but it's good to have you back home amen all right let's start here the promise to the Overcomer Revelations 3:5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in White rment I Will Not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and his holy angels He that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raymen this is actually a repetition of verse four wherein is made reference to the few who have not defiled their garments we used to have a saying years ago that no doubt was taken from from this verse it was keep your skirts clean it meant don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by staying uh by steering a course away from it now I think that's good advice for young and old I think I think we we in in this day if that that is that isn't incredible invi advice in in this digital Age and and um there's there's so many things you know for even you young you you you kids but then also for you teenagers there's so many things that's open to you steer away from it I and I want to just say this you know I think I think uh uh keeping ourselves away from Temptations we we got to ask ourselves if you're tempted about things you know with your phones especially you kids you you you young people uh well all of us you know W with with there's so much junk and sometimes when you're when you're all by yourself and you're you're um uh you know in in in your bedrooms and the devil is always trying to tempt you you know what I have found the good way to do away with that kind of thing is is if those of you that have the phones put it on the kitchen on the kitchen cabinet on on the counter leave it leave it there go to bed do what you need to do amen but don't give room for the Devils uh don't don't enter into Satan's playground amen and and you you know there's there's there's a lot of these things that that'll keep you guys you kids from ever getting into an addiction or ever keep you from getting into a bondage I if if you will do things as Christians right now and say you know what I I am tempted in this area so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put that up so that Satan can't lure me in and I think that's good advice what brother brandham just said he says keep your skirts clean he says it meant don't get involved in question questionable things others will be involved you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering a course away from it now God is going to reward those who follow this advice he's going to reward you he says now uh it says they are going to be clothed in white even as he is clothed in white praise the Lord Peter James and John saw him on Mount Transfiguration his clothes were as white as as light that is how the Saints are going to be clothed their garments will be shining exceedingly white you know we are living in the end time it is in this age that the churches are going to come together as they are even now controlling the world politics they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the world Oran organization of churches you won't be able to buy or to sell you will lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of of of church orders will be physically beaed there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in Preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist be system they will give in to the flatteries and the blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false Shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment um they will all be found naked my my my I think about that all of these all of these false preachers out there that are leading Millions astray they will not be given those white robes neither can they walk with him you can't walk in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it is not it is time to wake up and to hear the voice of God crying come out of her organized religion my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues amen God is speaking shun the religions of this world like you shun the plague leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance and the blood of the Lamb do it now for tomorrow may be too late let's read that verse together but do it now for tomorrow may be too late he that overcometh I will not blot his name out of The Book of Life once again we come to a most difficult portion of the word this verse superficially regarded will be used by both the Armenians and the calvinist to suit their purposes the Armenians will declare that this verse assuredly annuls John 6 um 6th chapter 37-39 and 41- 44 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last days the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which comes down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I I Come From Heaven down from heaven Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last days Armenian ISM makes the Father the will of the father not a sovereign purpose but merely a complacent desire as he stands back to see what all men do with this good and gracious gifts even e life eternal the calvinist do not see that they see in this verse strong consolation given to the suffering burdened saints that no matter how evil are the times how terrible the persecution because the Overcomer is one who believeth that Jesus is the Christ he will not have his name removed from that book some also say that this book of life is not the book the Lamb's Book of Life but as usual when one regards a verse superficially he comes up with a superficial understanding the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God deserves more than a casual study for up until now most students have merily drawn a conclusion that God places the names of those Born Again within the Lamb's Book Book of Life at the time of their rebirth if for any and if for any reason that name must be removed the space on the record will simply be a blank as it was before a name had been placed there there is one this is 100% opposite to what the word actually teaches as the very at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world as we will point out shortly also it is not a question of Simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had the opportunity to receive eternal life wherein one group received it had their names placed on the record while the others who refused it did not have their name so placed we will actually show by by scripture that multitudes were not even born again will go into eternal life as strange as this may sound it's certain it is certainly true we will also show that there is a group of people whose names have been placed on that record before the foundation of the world that cannot under any circumstances have those names removed but we'll also show that another group whose names were on that record before the foundation of the world will have their names removed to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book of Life or even thy book and the Book of the living only names are written in it Revelations 138 all that dwell on the Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Revelation 178 the Beast that thou sawest was and is not shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition they that dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was is not and yet is Revelations 20 and 12 to 15 I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead that were which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their Works death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire you can see that though there are two books mentioned there is there is always the reference to one book containing names in the Revelation it is called the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of life amen everyone understanding so far you you kids understanding so so in this in this book there's there's going to be uh and and we're going to go through it uh we're not going to get into the whole thing but brother Brandon's going to teach us now um there there's there is the The Book of Life that holds the that holds the natural life of of of the people and some some of these people are not even um it's they can have their names removed but God uses those people anoints those people even to for a specific purpose God raises these up and this is going to really as we read this we're going to be able to really see um where we are today because we got a lot of churches now I'm not saying that we we're going to say we're saved and no one else is saved that's up to God but what we do is we follow scripture and we never we never deviate from scripture our heart is always let us follow the word amen because if your name is written in that Lamb's Book of Life you're going to love his word right but there's going to be others who love to sing and preach and love to to worship but they don't love his word and and and God uses those people for a specific purpose amen but but eternal life can only be given to those whom God has shown favor to and and it's all God's favor amen now um okay so he says now where is this book located Luke 10:1 17-24 and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name he said unto them I will I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven and behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has HIIT these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him he turned uh and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are your eyes which see the things that ye see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them The Book of Life is definitely located in heaven and will appear at the great white Throne judgment in these verses Jesus said that their name names were written in heaven they were written in the Book of Life for that is where names are placed Jesus was speaking to the 70 verse 17 but he was also speaking to the 12 verse 23 these had all been rejoicing that Devils were subject to them in Jesus name Christ's rejoiner was Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but rather that your names are written in heaven book of life you will note here that Judas was one of those who were casting out devils in jesus' name but we know that he was a devil the son of predition according to John 670 and 71 Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of judas's scarat the son of Simon for he it was that that should betray him being one of the 12 John 17 and12 while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled John 13 10- 11 and also 18 Jesus said to him he that wasth needeth not Sav to wash his feet but is every wit clean and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean I speak not of you all I know who am I've chosen but that the scripture might be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his hell his heel against me now if this language means anything we must admit that Jesus was chosen by Jesus John 13:18 yet he was not clean John 1310 through1 Judas was also given to Jesus by the Father John 17:12 Let It Be noted here that the choosing and giving is exact parallel in the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were both forn they were predestinated to wrath while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification 1 Peter 2 and 8-9 says show both repeate or shows both repeate and elect even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also Al they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation Judas was numbered with the 12 and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost acts 1:16 And1 17 men and Brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake concerning Judas which was guide to them that took Jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry the part of that Judas obtaining among the 12 and then lost was neither inferior to the Ministers of the other 11 ministries of the other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign Ministry interjected among the ministries of the others acts 1:25 he that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place Judas a devil lost a out think about that that's incredible anointed chosen to to to uh work miracles the blessings of the Lord was was seemed to be on him he was the treasurer of the church he was he no one would have ever suspected but Jesus I said the father knows them that are his now I want us to really think about that now some of us look at the at the at the um those who have left the message and we wonder about these things and we sometimes we ask why we don't understand God fornew it and God has to have a Judas in this day to try to kill what God has given us but it will be the elect of God that'll have no other grounds no other recourse but to follow thus sayeth the Lord there is revelation that has already birthed in that predestined ated seed of God when when the 70 came that now now now they were all anointed the 70 were with the 12 they were all anointed to lay hands on the sick cast out Devils brother bom says they were right there but what happened when Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood now they automatically just started saying you're a vampire you you're you're wanting us to be a vampire you want what what's going on here and and and and the Bible says who who can follow this saying this is too hard we and the scripture says they followed him no more and then Jesus turns around to to the elect Jesus turns around to the 12 and the 12 he says will you go also and then Peter says where could we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life you you see that but even now the 120's G or the or the the 70s gone now it's down to 12 and even the 12 in that little bitty Church of Jesus's that was left after the church split and now there is still even one there was one left there and it was Judas and he would betray him but you see it required that it required that according to the scripture and according to the prophecy and this is so important today don't get disillusioned when you when you hear all of these guys listen I I I the the they're Liars those guys are liars that get out there and tearing down this message they're they're they're uh and and they're getting rich off of this kind of stuff they're and and and and they and they love that kind of a deal stick with what God gave you as the elect and don't follow anything else in fact don't even click on that internet with all of that junk I promise you they are lies right now now brother we we had a precious family that came here for a while that were a black family and uh and and so they they came here and and then uh they came to me and said says you know uh boy the message is is really um uh um racist and so boy they man you know uh there's all this internet stuff you know Donnie Reagan the the most racist racist pastor of in America and then and then they came and they said but brother brandom he taught this he was he was a part of the KKK he was and and and and he uh degraded the blacks and he done all of these things here and I'm going whoa whoa whoa whoa where where where where are you getting that oh there quotes and of course I already knew what they were talking about I said well I tell you what let's look at your quotes and then we will go and look at the look at the uh read the quote themselves so I took my computer and I read so where he was where brother Brandon would talk about he was an in uh um se segregationist he was talking and talking about God was a segregationist he was talking about the world and the church that you got to be separate so they would take these quotes and they were splicing these things together and I go read the thing and I said now does that sound like anything that you just read and they're going um no and then on the blacks so here we'd go and we'd read it see they they are deceivers that are making brother brandham look like he was a racist I don't believe a word those yellow bellies have to say they hide behind their computers and they put that stuff on the internet and and and people follow that kind of junk but it must happen it's got to take place are you understanding God allowed them to to be anointed allowed them to sit Among Us allowed them to even be preachers and anointed them in doing that you see what I'm saying but they end you know there there was four crosses we talk about the three crosses but there were four crosses man a cross is made of made of tree and and and there was there was Jesus then there was the that there was the thief that was making fun of him and telling him hey if you be if you be the Messiah get us off of here and then there's the third one that says hey this man has done nothing this is a good man and he's saying hey I know who you are I'm asking that you remember me when you come into your kingdom and then there was the fourth one that was Judas that went and hung himself on a sycamore tree from the guilt but his name was taken off of that book of life it was never on the Lamb's Book of Life so I just wanted to parallel that as we look at at our I want you to see how important this this part of the church age book is so that we don't ever get confused about what where everything is all Christian see we look at those things as we go all right now um now let's let's look on down here it says um let's see where was where were we at all right so we're we're on page 269 and the first uh the the the first paragraph now before we pursue this thought on Judas let us go to the Old Testament and see where God did the same thing in Genesis 35 23 to 26 the sons of Jacob were 12 in number and their names were as follows Reuben Simeon Levi Judah issachar Ze Joseph and Benjamin Dan and nefeli Gad and Asher these 12 sons uh Sons descendants become the 12 tribes of of Israel which with the exception that Joseph did not have a tribe named after him for in the Providence of God Providence of God there were to be 13 tribes and Joseph's two sons were given the honor of bringing the 12 to 13 you know of course this was necessary as Levi was separated unto God for the priesthood thus we when Israel left Egypt and God gave them the Tabernacle in the wilderness we find the tribe of Levi ministering to the 12 tribes named Reuben Simeon isachar Judah zebulun Benjamin Dan nefeli Gad Asher Ephraim and man the order of the host uh of the host names uh them thus in new uh numbers 10 11-28 there is no mention of Joseph or Levi but when we look at Revelation 7 4-8 where it says there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel it names them thus Judah Reuben Gad Asher navelli manessa Simeon Levi ishar zebulun Joseph and Benjamin we are back to the 12 tribes with Levi and Joseph named among them but Dan and Ephron are missing the question now arises why are these two tribes deleted the answer lies in Deuteronomy 12:16 to20 for ye know how uh we have dealt in dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the Nations which by which which ye passed by ye have seen their Abominations their Idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them lest there be uh should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord Our God and go to serve the Gods in of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth Gul and wormwood and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying I shall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to thirst the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven herein is pronounced the curse against idolatry or spiritual fornication the tribe that turned to idolatry was to have his name blotted out the history of the two tribes whose names were blotted out because of idolatry as found in First Kings 1225 to30 then jeroboam built sheam in Mount Ephraim and and dwelt therein and went out from then and built panu and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the House of David if this people go up and do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of the people turn again to their lord even unto rabor the king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to reaborn King of Judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which which brought thee out of the land of Egypt and he set the one in bethl and the other he put in Dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before one even unto Dan Hosea 46 47 Ephraim is joined to Idols let him alone isn't that something now particularly that the punishment for idolatry was the name of that tribe was to be blotted out from under the heaven Deuteronomy 29 and 20 it does not say that it would be blotted out in heaven but from under Heaven that is exactly how it is for now Israel is back in Palestine and soon the Lord will seal 144,000 of them but from that number an and Ephraim are missing man am I reading too fast is this just this this is interesting how the prophet brings this out Revelation 7 4-8 I heard the number of them that which were sealed and there were sealed uh 44,000 of all the tribes of Israel the children of Israel of the tribe of Judah were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Reuben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Asser was were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Napalm were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of manessa were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of iscar was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of zabulon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 of The Tribe of Benjamin were still 12,000 note Dan and Ephraim are missing now thi with this see Daniel 12 And1 which refers to these 144,000 being sealed during The Sixth Seal and the time of the Great Tribulation or Jacob's trouble and at that time shall Michael stand up and the the great Prince which standeth for the people of thy children uh or the children of thy people and there shall be a a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the time the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book however after the period of tribulation during the Millennium as seen by Ezekiel in in 48 1-8 and 229 29 we see the tribes back once more in divine order but from the time that ephra and Dan joined themselves to the idols they died and those tribes were no more have no more recognition now I realize that since the destruction of Judah all records of all tribes have been lost so that no one can say for sure what what the what tribe he is from but God knows that great God who was bringing Israel back to Palestine knows exactly which tribe every true Israelite is from and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing here are the tribes of Israel Ezekiel 48 1-8 and 22- 29 now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of hethin as one goeth to hameth haenan the border of Damascus northward to the coast of hammoth for these are his uh his sides East E and West a portion for Dan and the border of Dan from the East side and to the West Side a portion for Asher by the border of Asher from the East side unto the West Side a portion for naali uh and by the border of napali that from the East side to the west side a portion for Manasseh and the border of Manasseh from the East side to the west side a portion for Ephraim and by the border of Ephraim from the East side even unto the West Side a portion for Reuben by the border of Reuben from the East side unto the West Side a portion for Judah by the border of Judah from the East side and the West Side Etc moreover from the PO possession of the Levites and from the possession of the city being in the midst uh of that which is the princess between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be the prince before the prince as for the rest of the tribes from the East side into the West Side Benjamin shall have a portion by the Benjamin of by the border of Benjamin from the East side into the West Side Simeon shall have a portion and by the border of Simeon from the East side into the West Side isachar a portion by the border of is isar from the East side unto the West Side zebulun a portion by the border of zebulun from the East side unto the West Side Gat a portion by the border of GAD unto at the South Side uh Southward Etc another illustration that we might take in the story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan land God's purpose in this age was to bring Israel out and to take them in to the end that they might serve him thus when they left Egypt they all came out uh under the blood of the sacrificial lamb they all went through the waters of baptism in the Red Sea they all joined the mighty Miracles all ate of the Mana all drank of The Rock and and in so far as obvious external blessings and manifestations were concerned they all partook in like and equal manner but when they come to Moab those who joined in the Feast of bpor all died their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was there they refused the word of God and turned from it now this is what Hebrews 6 1-9 speaks of which was brought out so carefully in the pergam manian age you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word there are people who seems involved in the things Almost 100% they're like Judas no one but Jesus knew exactly what kind of a person Judas was so the day came that Judas did exactly what Israel did at bore he decided he wanted to join with the false Vine forces enter into financial and political organization of anti- word Antichrist religion and he did so he was foed the other 11 were not they could not be for they were of the very elect and when Judas left and betrayed the Lord his name was removed from the book of of Life Revelations 229 amen isn't that quite a reading now how how powerful it is how the Lord says he would blot his name from under the heavens but when they come back in the Millennium they'll be back so so he's he's showing us how that God how God works in those things amen how how many wants to read another couple more pages all right we'll let's read a couple more pages here um it says now I'm sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in The Book of Life were part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and worship of him and though though they did not worship according to truth word like Judas they didn't go all the way see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the Mysteries he had the a Ministry of power granted unto him he healed the sick cast out devils in jesus' name but when The Showdown came he sold out for Golden political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of that Spirit of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way can I hear an amen that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judah failed Judas failed multitudes fail right there when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life in order to further clarify this removal of a name from the book of life we ought to extend our thoughts to Israel in the days of Moses uh Exodus 3230 through 34 it came to pass on the tomorrow that Moses said unto the people you have sinned and a great a great sin now I will go up unto the Lord per avention he will make an atonement for your sin Moses returned unto the Lord and said oh this people have sin great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou wil forgive their sins and if not blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou Hast written and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will I blot out of my book therefore now go lead the people unto the place which I have spoken unto thee behold my angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them it is more than evident that the names have been and will be removed from the book of life air time shall be no more in this particular place it was because of idolatry even as when Dan and Ephraim lost their rights as tribes for worshiping the golden calves all who worshiped the idols had their names removed from The Book of Life when Israel rejected the leadership of God in the pillar of fire and turned to worship the golden calves their names were removed from The Book of Life Exodus 32:33 whosoever has sinned against me him will I blot out of my book if such turning to Idols demands the penalty of the removing of names from the book of life then most assuredly Israel's reject of Jesus Christ as Messiah would demand as severe a penalty that is this is exactly so in Psalm 69 which sets the forth the humiliation of Jesus it says in verse 21 to 28 they gave me a Gul for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their tables be come a snare before them that which should be uh should have been for their welfare let it be a become a trap let their eyes be darkened uh and that they see not and their loins continually to shake pour out thine indignation upon them let thy wrathful anger take hold of them let their habitation be desolate let none dwell in their tents for they persecute him whom thou Hast smitten they talk uh to the grief of those whom thou Hast smitten add iniquity under their iniquity let them not come into thy righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous when the Jews rejected Jesus there was a literal turning away from God from them to the Gentiles acts 13:46 to 48 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary for the word word of God uh that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye have put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath God commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles and that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the the Lord and this and and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed this is not to suggest there will be no more names from the tribes of Israel remaining in the book of life for many of those but not multitudes have the principles of election uh through the principles of election will be in the Gentile Church age and come into the body of Jesus Christ showing that their names did indeed remain in the Book of Life and also as we will show according to the fifth seal multitudes of martyred Jews will be given white robes and eternal life by the Lord and also the 144,000 will be sealed at his coming proving that their names were not deleted neither uh either but it is even uh as most accurately set forth in Psalm 69 that it is the wicked or unrighteous reject of Christ that destroys uh and the Destroyers of his people whose names are removed as Israel chosen people of God in majority forfeited their rights in the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so the majority of the Gentile church will also come into condemnation with the resultant removal of their names from The Book of Life by rejecting the word and thereor thereby entering into the word the world ecumenical movement which is the image erected to the Beast now we're going to stop right there tonight now there is a lot to chew on there and I know I know that's a that's a big reading but I wanted to get there tonight and and brother brandham is going to continue to deal with this and he's going to show he's he's going to show um how that the Book of Life is the record of the wheat plant okay so he's he's fixing to go go into it he's going to say so the Book of Life had these names in each of the ages there had to come justification there had to come sanctification there had so he says those those names that were written in that book of life was for a specific purpose amen and there yes there was elect in each one of those ages so but those denominations were carrying the seed to the next age to the next to the next state so that there would be a bride who would take the full word amen and be raptured in this age that is incredible he had a purpose Judas had a purpose the Bible says that God raised up pharaoh to show himself strong on Israel's behalf and God brings these up to show himself strong amen there's fixing to be a bride and a Rapture and I say here tonight Lord help me help me to to to keep my garments pure and spotless let me walk let me walk with God Amen as as as he wants his uh wants me to walk with him can you say amen amen and so uh I so I'm thankful for that here tonight I I'm thankful for the power of God's uh Eternal Word here here in this age all right any any questions now I know there was a lot of reading but but as everyone pretty well understand brother Bram showing showing that that uh uh using the Old Testament scriptures and uh to show what what this book is even today any anyone have anything they want to say or have any questions here tonight only one question praise the Lord hallelujah well I'm glad that that God's got my name written in the Lamb's Book of Life how do I know I have the Holy Ghost I want to be in the word all the way want to be in the word he says the the only the Holy Ghost filled will want to be in the word all the way Lord help me to be in the word all the way amen don't let nothing nothing hinder me don't oh God let me let me be pleasing to you let me serve the purpose for which you have called me for amen all right tonight no no comments no questions tonight amen I told you he was going to get in some good stuff there I I love that part of it it it really this here really opens up the and we're going to see it because brother Bram goes just beautifully in this uh and and and talking about how that uh the end the end product is for the seed to come through the seed the seed's the only thing that goes in the WAP the rest of it just dies off amen yes they had their names in that book but then it was it when when they refused to go any further they were died off then the next group would come in and when they refused to go any further the names were taken out they go on up next name you know then then then they were blotted out of the out of the book but it's for a purpose because there is a seed that's written in the Lamb's Book of Life That's predestinated to a Rapture and we're going to make that rapture oh don't look don't look at these don't don't look at the religious characters out there just love Christ love his word amen stay with his word well yall quiet on that amen we want that you know I I I know there's just so many things out there to try to pull our attention away and trying to say well you know uh you know they they've got this and they've got that and they've got this we've only got a little youth group and we've only got a little church and we've only got listen I'm just glad to be a part I'm just glad to be a part of God's elect amen amen well if there's nothing else that um y'all no comments or no questions um the musicians can come and um amen praise the name of Jesus oh how I

elect going all the way down through there was Luther age that was elected all the way through they were all sealed away under their message [Music] but what is so great for us is we're at the end and this book that was once all sealed it was all just done in symbols God has come in this day open the book up and revealing the symbols to us so that we can see that we're not just going down in the
