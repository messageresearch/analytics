[24:32] Just as long
[24:35] as I have Jesus,
[24:40] there's no way for me to lose.
[24:46] Even though
[24:49] this life grows weary
[24:54] along the way.
[25:00] And just as long as I can feel him
[25:08] and I know he's by my side.
[25:14] It's so good to know he's with me
[25:22] every day.
[25:27] And just as long as I have Jesus, I
[25:35] never worry.
[25:41] even

[25:58] near me when I call and he meets my
[26:05] every need.
[26:11] It's so good to know he's with me
[26:18] every day.
[26:21] Oh, listen. Well, there's been times
[26:26] I know I've felt him
[26:31] and I know I've caused him pain.
[26:36] Yet by rights
[26:40] there is nothing
[26:43] that I can say.
[26:49] Yet through mercy
[26:52] he forgives me
[26:56] gives me strength to try again.
[27:02] It's so good to know he's with me
[27:09] every day.

[28:05] Would you help me? And just as long as I
[28:11] have Jesus,
[28:13] I don't have to worry.
[28:19] In his arms of love he keeps me
[28:26] when I stray.
[28:31] He is always

[29:48] both great and small.
[29:53] Yes, Lord.
[29:55] He gave his life
[29:59] for me.
[30:02] Made everything
[30:05] new.
[30:09] He is my everything.
[30:16] None other will do.
[30:21] Sing that again now. He is my
[30:25] everything.
[30:32] My heart
[30:45] is small.
[30:47] He gave his life. He gave his life for
[30:53] me.
[30:55] made everything
[30:58] new.
[31:02] He is my everything

[31:10] will do.
[31:15] Amen. Is that how you feel tonight?
[31:18] What a friend we have in Jesus
[31:26] and all
[31:29] our sins and grief to bear.

[31:39] a privilege
[31:42] to carry.

[31:54] peace.

[32:34] Amen. God bless you.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wasn't quite ready for
[32:44] that, but for the glory of the Lord.
[32:46] Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Last time I tried this song, I forgot
[32:49] the word. So, Lord willing, it'll be
[32:51] better this time.
[32:54] every once in a while.
[33:00] An old friend of mine
[33:07] will stop by and ask me
[33:14] where you been, what's on your mind.
[33:19] They wonder why I'm not drinking
[33:25] and painting the old town red.
[33:33] Tell them I'm serving Jesus now and the
[33:38] old man is dead.
[33:45] I used to live such a wicked life.
[33:51] I had no hope inside.
[33:57] I was lost in darkness,
[34:03] searching for the light.
[34:08] And then one day in the little church
[34:14] after hearing what the preacher said
[34:22] started serving
[34:24] Jesus and the old man is dead.
[34:35] And this man you see before you
[34:42] may look a lot the same.
[34:49] I may wear the same old clothes,
[34:55] have the same old name,
[35:00] but you're looking on the outside.
[35:06] Please look inside instead.
[35:13] You'd find a brand new man. Because the
[35:18] old
[35:20] man is dead.
[35:26] Cuz the man you see before you
[35:33] may look a lot the same.
[35:40] I may wear the same old clothes.
[35:46] wear the same old name,
[35:50] but you're looking on the outside.
[35:57] Look inside instead
[36:04] and you'd find a brand new man. Cuz the
[36:09] old man is dead.
[36:15] Amen.
[36:20] Amen.
[36:21] You see that?
[36:23] Thinking of that song the cathedrals
[36:26] used to sing. And no one can sing it
[36:28] better than George John's. Thanks to
[36:30] Calvary. I'm not the man I used to be.
[36:33] And tell you what, I I can't go back and
[36:36] and listen to that ever without crying
[36:38] and thinking of what the Lord has done
[36:40] for me. And all I can say is thanks to
[36:42] Calvary. I'm not the man I used to be.
[36:46] Thanks to Calvary, I don't go there
[36:48] anymore. I mean, I mean, what a what a
[36:51] love we ought to have for Christ
[36:52] tonight.
[36:54] Amen. The out outward man may look the
[36:57] same, but it's that inward man, Brother
[36:58] John, that that's been changed and
[37:00] renewed. Amen. Can't we sing this as the
[37:03] man of God gets ready to come? Let's try
[37:06] F. He touched me. Oh, he touched me. Oh
[37:10] shackled
[37:12] by your hand
[37:15] the burden.
[37:20] I was beneath
[37:22] a load of guilt
[37:26] and shame.
[37:32] Then the hand of Jesus
[37:36] touched me. Yes, he did.
[37:41] And now
[37:43] I am no longer
[37:46] the same.
[37:49] How many can say this tonight? He
[37:52] touched me. Yes, he did. Oh,
[37:57] he touched me.
[38:01] And oh
[38:04] the joy that floods my soul.
[38:11] You see something
[38:14] has happened.
[38:16] And now
[38:18] I know
[38:21] he touched me and made
[38:25] me whole.
[38:28] The second verse. Oh, and since
[38:33] I met this blessed
[38:36] savior,
[38:41] ever since he cleansed and made
[38:46] me whole
[38:51] and I shall never cease
[38:56] to praise him. How about it tonight?
[38:59] Thank you, Lord. And I will shout it.
[39:03] I'll eternal
[39:05] he rose
[39:08] with all your heart. He touched me
[39:21] and all
[39:23] the joy
[39:25] that flood to my soul.
[39:31] Something
[39:33] has happened.
[39:36] And now
[39:38] I know
[39:41] he touched me
[39:43] and made
[39:46] me whole.
[39:52] Amen. Has he touched you here this
[39:54] evening?
[39:55] Amen. The Lord has certainly got a way
[39:58] of touching his people, making things
[40:02] that are wrong, right? He seems to
[40:05] always have the words to say, the
[40:08] ability to mend all the things that have
[40:11] been broken. Amen. How many just want to
[40:15] be touched by the Lord here this
[40:16] evening? Amen. Do you enjoy the service
[40:19] this morning? Amen.
[40:26] Certainly certainly enjoyed the service
[40:28] this morning. Appreciate uh brother
[40:31] Windle just speaking what the Lord leads
[40:34] on his heart and and uh just always
[40:37] appreciate that about him and amen just
[40:40] telling us what we need to hear and what
[40:43] the Lord's just placed on his heart and
[40:44] we just want to thank him for that. Um
[40:47] but if we could I'd like to go ahead and
[40:50] go into our scriptures here. Uh I'd like
[40:52] to start Exodus and
[40:56] Exodus 3 and believe it's the seventh
[41:01] the seventh verse.
[41:12] We have Exodus 3 and7
[41:15] and the um
[41:18] scripture reads thus.
[41:23] And the Lord said, I have surely seen
[41:25] the affliction of my people which are in
[41:28] Egypt, and have heard their cry by
[41:31] reasons of their taskmasters.
[41:33] For I know their sorrows, and I have
[41:36] come down to deliver them out of the
[41:38] hand of the Egyptians,
[41:40] and to bring them up out of the land,
[41:42] unto a good land, and a large, and a
[41:45] land flowing with milk and honey, unto
[41:48] the place of the Canaanites, and the
[41:50] Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
[41:52] Parizzites,
[41:54] and the Hivites, and the Jeb Jebusites.
[41:58] Now therefore, behold, the cry of the
[41:59] children of Israel has come up unto me.
[42:02] I have also seen the oppression where
[42:04] the Egyptians oppressed them.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can just bow our heads to
[42:10] the Lord here this evening. Heavenly
[42:12] Father, we just appreciate you, Lord.
[42:14] And
[42:15] &gt;&gt; and God, we just want to thank you for
[42:17] your love and your grace and your mercy,
[42:19] Lord. And we just want to thank you for
[42:20] just being with all of us.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; We just pray, Lord, that your word would
[42:24] just go forth, Father, and it would
[42:25] just, Lord, touch where it needs to be,
[42:28] Lord. Just keep us from saying anything,
[42:30] Lord. Help us to say something, Father,
[42:32] to help your people in Jesus name. Amen.
[42:35] You could be seated here this evening.
[42:38] And um
[42:40] as again I sure enjoyed the service this
[42:42] morning and and um
[42:46] you know and if I could just for a few
[42:47] moments um I've been kind of th uh kind
[42:51] of dwelling on this thought and just
[42:54] kind of going back and forth just
[42:55] touching on things here and there and I
[42:57] was kind of drawing some of my
[42:59] inspiration from some of the messages uh
[43:01] brother Wendell and brother Harry had
[43:03] spoken uh spoken on uh here this this
[43:06] last little bit there. Brother Window
[43:08] was talking about the taking the land
[43:11] there there in Ewima, you know, and then
[43:13] you had uh brother Harry where he was uh
[43:15] took the Thanksgiving sermon and he was
[43:18] talking about uh uh a new land and and
[43:21] that's what kind of triggered my thought
[43:23] here this evening. So I was just kind of
[43:25] thinking about that about how that uh
[43:28] you know thinking about this new land uh
[43:31] when he was up there and he was speaking
[43:32] about it and it kind of triggered my
[43:34] thought and some of my my thinking and I
[43:36] was thinking about how that sometimes
[43:38] when you talk about a new land it um
[43:41] it's surrounded by you know the unknown
[43:44] or it's surrounded by could be
[43:46] surrounded by opportunity you know or a
[43:49] new beginning and so I was kind of
[43:51] thinking about that as as kind of my
[43:53] theme or Like again like I said my my
[43:55] thought process and and I began to look
[43:57] up just kind of a few times a few places
[44:00] and where humanity has kind of uh
[44:02] pioneered or kind of just uh kind of
[44:04] moved on moved in the unknown in life
[44:06] and was just kind of just seeking places
[44:09] that where where uh there was
[44:10] opportunity you know or there's a place
[44:12] of new beginning and and uh and you know
[44:16] each one of us you know each one of
[44:18] these things that I had I was thinking
[44:20] about or that I had looked into you know
[44:22] every one of every one one of them, you
[44:24] know, uh they they had obstacles and
[44:26] they had things in their way in order uh
[44:29] you know that stood in their way for in
[44:31] for them to kind of achieve what they
[44:33] were after. And I was kind of looking at
[44:35] some of the things and a lot of us know
[44:37] about the Oregon Trail. You know, a lot
[44:39] of us know about the history uh from
[44:42] between uh you know uh you know uh uh
[44:45] the there was really going west there
[44:47] wasn't a whole lot of trails that was
[44:48] made. There was a lot of explorations
[44:50] that had been done. And there was there
[44:52] was people that had made it over there
[44:54] to come back and to tell everybody
[44:56] about, you know, the the greatness of
[44:58] what was over there, about the lush
[45:00] farmlands that were west of the Colorado
[45:02] Rockies, you know, that was there to
[45:04] tell people, you know, of of all the
[45:06] timber and all of the unclaimed all of
[45:09] the unclaimed land and all of the all of
[45:11] those kinds of things that, you know,
[45:13] that were uh that were out there, you
[45:15] know, and and it was in 1839. It was the
[45:18] first uh uh train wagon, you know, or of
[45:20] immigrants anyways, of people from the
[45:23] eastern part of the United States that
[45:24] had worked their way west. And it was a
[45:26] it was a 2,170
[45:29] mile trail that that was cut from uh all
[45:32] uh all the way from the east to the west
[45:34] to the Rockies. And and it wasn't an
[45:36] easy thing. There was a lot of a lot of
[45:38] things that they encountered. you know,
[45:40] there was a lack of water or there was a
[45:41] lack of food, you know, there or there
[45:43] was a lot of obstacles, rocky pathways
[45:46] and different things and but yet they
[45:48] still pressed on. And you know, I begin
[45:50] to think about uh you know, we even here
[45:52] in Oklahoma, we have the land run there
[45:54] in 1889 where you know, there was uh I
[45:57] guess an estimated amount of like 50,000
[45:59] people that had showed up to come to do
[46:01] the to do the land run and and a lot of
[46:04] them were uh a lot of them were after,
[46:06] you know, new opportunities. a lot of a
[46:09] lot of land that um hadn't been claimed.
[46:11] A lot of uh just a lot of things that
[46:14] were that that they could people could
[46:16] go out and and try to start a new
[46:18] beginning or or to do better for
[46:20] themselves. And it was approximately 2
[46:22] million square miles that 50,000 people
[46:25] were just going out and going out and
[46:27] staking claims and and and you know this
[46:29] section was this and this section was
[46:31] that and and I can't remember how many
[46:33] days or hours it said that it took for
[46:35] all the land to just get gobbled up and
[46:38] but yet uh you know all of this was just
[46:40] a journey. All of it was a uh is a story
[46:43] that we tell about. And you know, I was
[46:44] thinking about, of course, where brother
[46:46] Harry was talking about the pilgrims and
[46:48] and about how that when the the
[46:50] pilgrims, they they were being
[46:51] persecuted religiously for their beliefs
[46:54] because they were Puritans and about how
[46:56] that uh you know, uh they they had
[46:58] gotten they had they had gotten about
[47:00] the the Mayflower and the Speed Well,
[47:02] and you know, and they had desired
[47:05] because they had heard about a new land
[47:07] and they had heard about the opportunity
[47:09] and and the and the place where they can
[47:11] go and and they can worship freely and
[47:13] they can come to a place where uh uh
[47:15] they didn't have the taxes of Britain.
[47:17] They weren't under the rule of Britain.
[47:19] They weren't under the rule and and
[47:20] being persecuted religiously for what
[47:23] they believed and and they could go to
[47:24] this new place. So this was something
[47:26] that that intrigued this group of people
[47:29] in order in order to go to to this place
[47:32] and and you know again there was still a
[47:34] lot of hardships that took place as our
[47:36] brother had talked about. You know,
[47:37] there was, you know, there was, you
[47:39] know, there was food again. There was
[47:40] water. You know, there was there was
[47:42] disease, there was sickness, there was a
[47:44] lot of different things that that that
[47:46] had uh uh come on their way. They had to
[47:49] they had a problem. I believe he said
[47:51] that it was supposed to take 33 days,
[47:53] but yet it took 66 days in order to get
[47:55] there, you know. So, in in order in
[47:57] order for this journey to go on, there
[47:59] was a there was some perseverance that
[48:01] kind of really had to take place. It was
[48:02] more than just the person that was
[48:04] driving the boat that had to see the
[48:06] vision that was really going on, but it
[48:08] was everybody that was aboard that had
[48:09] to be able to see the vision in a
[48:12] broader spectrum. And and I begin to
[48:14] think about this and I and you know and
[48:16] I begin to think about how that you know
[48:18] uh I can't I can't uh help but to you
[48:21] know to but to try to to put a lot of my
[48:23] thought process through a filter you
[48:25] know and and you know and I try to take
[48:27] that filter and I I I take that and I
[48:29] just begin to kind of move some of this
[48:31] through through God's word and and I
[48:33] can't help but to to bring up you know
[48:35] the story of Israel and a lot of us we
[48:37] we all know who Israel is and we all
[48:39] know that that Israel had the had their
[48:42] have had you A lot of things that they
[48:44] did was just all put on paper, you know?
[48:46] I mean, how would you like it in your
[48:47] life? Everything that you did, brother
[48:49] Donald, was put on paper and it was just
[48:51] put in front of the people for everybody
[48:52] to see, you know? I mean, a lot of us
[48:54] would wouldn't appreciate that. But yet,
[48:56] God did these things for a reason. And I
[48:59] can't help for the fact that, you know,
[49:00] that that God would would save would
[49:03] save a prophet from being from being
[49:06] killed from, you know, from the children
[49:08] from two years and under, you know, that
[49:10] that Pharaoh would come and he would put
[49:12] a decree out and and he would and he
[49:14] would he would come and he would say
[49:16] that we need to kill all the children
[49:17] that are two years and two years and
[49:20] younger and and and and and you know,
[49:22] then and so the mother puts this this
[49:24] baby inside of a inside of a river
[49:26] somewhere, you know, and she just goes
[49:27] goes out there and we know the story
[49:29] about how that she prayed and how she
[49:31] pitched it and she done these different
[49:32] things and and you know and Moses just
[49:34] floats along just goes inside of uh goes
[49:36] inside of Pharaoh's courts there and
[49:38] just gets picked up and and by by the
[49:40] child or by by the by the by the the
[49:42] mother or the daughter there, you know,
[49:44] and and she and she makes him part of
[49:46] the kingdom. And I just don't see how
[49:47] how God would save his life and then put
[49:50] him in a situation to lead to lead a
[49:52] people without there being some type of
[49:55] purpose. And and the thing that really
[49:56] strikes my mind is when the scripture
[49:58] goes about and it talks about the the uh
[50:01] it goes and it talks about there and in
[50:03] in Psalms 37 and 23 and and this is the
[50:07] first scripture that kind of come to my
[50:08] mind and thinking about this about how
[50:10] that the scripture says that the steps
[50:12] of a good man are ordered by the Lord
[50:14] and he delightth in his way. So, I don't
[50:17] feel like I don't feel like Moses just
[50:19] was stumbling upon these things, but God
[50:21] was using Moses's footsteps to to be
[50:25] able to document something in a bigger
[50:27] spectrum, in a in a bigger light. They
[50:29] were going through something that they
[50:31] were going through something. They were
[50:32] typing out or they were they were doing
[50:34] something that we could see. And and now
[50:36] we a lot of us know the story and if you
[50:38] don't, I'm not going to just go into the
[50:41] story and, you know, for detail. We're
[50:42] just going to kind of, you know, do like
[50:44] what you do on a jet ski on water. We're
[50:46] just going to, you know, we're just
[50:48] going to kind of, you know, just bounce
[50:49] across a little bit of the story here.
[50:51] And and you know, but Israel, Israel was
[50:54] was uh in a situation, you know, they
[50:56] were in goan. You we know the story
[50:58] about how that they were brought into
[50:59] Israel due to the or brought into Egypt
[51:01] to due to the famine. They were put in
[51:03] goan, but yet Israel began to Israel
[51:06] began to adapt to their surroundings.
[51:08] Israel begin to not be not just be
[51:11] separated Israel, but yet they begin to
[51:14] adapt to the surroundings and they begin
[51:16] to become a part of a part of Egypt and
[51:19] they begin to no doubt take on Egyptian
[51:21] things and take on Egyptian customs and
[51:23] do do these other do do these things and
[51:26] and you know what and and we know the
[51:28] story about how that how that God the
[51:32] thing about Israel is that God had
[51:34] already promised Israel to not be in
[51:38] Egypt. But he would they were promised
[51:40] another land and it was the scripture
[51:41] that we read that that he had that they
[51:44] were going to souljourn into a land for
[51:46] 400 years and that and that and but yet
[51:48] that he had a land that he was going to
[51:50] take them to that this land that it
[51:52] flowed with milk and honey. Now I want
[51:54] you to notice something that he was
[51:56] giving them somebody else's land.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; What a bust, right? You know you got
[52:01] some land and God's just going to give
[52:02] it away, right? you know, he said this
[52:04] is the land of the Hittites and the
[52:06] Parizzites and the the Jebusites and all
[52:09] these different itites that were out
[52:10] there, you know, and he but he said that
[52:12] that that he was going to give them a
[52:14] land that was flowing with milk and
[52:16] honey and Israel began to adapt to the
[52:18] place that that that they were at. But
[52:20] Moses meanwhile was called out and he we
[52:23] know the story. He was in Egypt. And God
[52:25] began to deal with Moses because Israel
[52:27] wasn't meant to stay in Egypt all of
[52:30] their life. But because Israel was a
[52:32] called people, Israel Israel had a
[52:35] promise that was written over their
[52:37] life. And so God through in his in his
[52:40] the the prophetic wheels of God's timing
[52:42] begin to click. And God had his man in
[52:45] the right place. He put him out. He took
[52:47] him from sleeping in the king's chambers
[52:49] to sleeping with goats and sheep and and
[52:52] and he had a and he and he had a woman
[52:54] that just, you know, that that that that
[52:56] they had his number, you know, and and
[52:58] you know what, he couldn't really just
[52:59] order her around so to, you know, too
[53:01] very much, you know, but but he put him
[53:03] into this position to where now God's
[53:06] wheels are beginning to move and and now
[53:08] God was beginning to go and he was going
[53:10] to go after the promised seed that that
[53:14] he had already put in inside of his
[53:16] word. And so he be to move onto Moses
[53:19] and he be to send him down into Egypt
[53:22] and and he be to come down and he be to
[53:25] God heard the cries of the task masters
[53:27] that was being placed upon Egypt and God
[53:30] was coming to pull them out of Egypt.
[53:33] And so he come down there and we know
[53:35] the story and he'd come down to Pharaoh
[53:37] and he was like Pharaoh and you know I
[53:39] want you to you let my people go. And
[53:41] Pharaoh was like, "Nope, ain't
[53:42] happening. Ain't not a not a not a fat
[53:45] chance." You know, because Israel had
[53:46] come to the point where they were they
[53:48] were building their pyramids. They were
[53:50] they they were putting money in their
[53:51] treasury. I mean, they were they were
[53:53] they were their they they were they were
[53:55] craftsmen. They were just they were just
[53:57] expendable pieces of property, but yet
[53:59] at the same time, they needed them in
[54:01] order to build their empire. And they
[54:03] was like, "Nope, ain't having it." But
[54:05] he didn't realize, Pharaoh didn't
[54:07] realize that they were a called out
[54:08] people. And it didn't matter. Amen. They
[54:11] didn't matter the strength that Pharaoh
[54:13] had. It didn't matter the ability that
[54:15] Pharaoh had to be able to keep Israel in
[54:18] his grips. They were going to leave
[54:20] Egypt. And we know the story about how
[54:22] God come down miraculously with with 10
[54:26] different plagues. And he come down and
[54:27] he he turned, you know, the water into
[54:30] blood. He brought fl he brought frogs
[54:32] and he brought flies and he brought he
[54:34] brought all these different things that
[54:36] had come and then simply or or or when
[54:39] he come and then he had brought death
[54:41] and it was the final straw and Israel or
[54:44] are or or um Egypt let Israel go you
[54:48] know and so and I as again I'm trying to
[54:50] just breeze through this because I'm
[54:52] trying to get to a point but but you
[54:54] know Israel or Egypt when it finally got
[54:57] to the point where it had let Egypt go
[54:59] you know and and and and and 10 10
[55:02] plagues had come, you know, and God gave
[55:04] God sent death to destroy all of the
[55:06] firstborn, but but yet he sent the blood
[55:09] to Israel to be able to put on the
[55:11] doorpost for protection. And finally,
[55:14] Pharaoh was like, you know, let them all
[55:15] go. Just just get out of my hair, get
[55:17] out of my way. You know, you would think
[55:19] that you would think that at that moment
[55:21] that it would just be peaches that it
[55:23] would just be like, you know what, God
[55:24] did this, but you know, God brought, you
[55:27] know, down frogs and flies and and fire
[55:29] and and turned water into blood, you
[55:32] know, and you would just think that from
[55:34] that point on that God would begin to
[55:36] pave the way and God would just be
[55:38] coming like, you know, with with
[55:39] trumpets, like these are my people and
[55:41] and I'm just going to march them into
[55:43] here and we're going to roll out the red
[55:45] carpet and we're just going to do these
[55:46] things. But yet they didn't realize that
[55:48] the journey with God had just begun.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; So they get out into the middle of a
[55:54] desert somewhere and they get pinned up.
[55:56] We know the story. They get pinned up at
[55:58] the Red Sea.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; GOD SAVES them at the Red Sea. We we we
[56:04] can look here into the scriptures. We
[56:07] can look here and we can see here in in
[56:09] in some of the scriptures where where it
[56:11] goes on and and we see where now
[56:14] Israel's on the journey and and and God
[56:17] comes in and delivers a wind for them
[56:19] and and and they're on their way and
[56:20] there's all kinds of murmuring that
[56:22] takes place and and you know what it's
[56:24] hot that's it's hot on the journey.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; It stinks. Think of all the cattle
[56:30] that's there and and you're walking
[56:31] behind a whole bunch of sheep. You're
[56:33] walking behind a whole bunch of cattle
[56:35] and you're walking behind a whole bunch
[56:36] of horses and you're walking by, you
[56:38] know what? This ain't this just this
[56:40] ain't the grand journey that it's
[56:41] supposed to be. I mean, these are the
[56:43] children of Israel. These are the ones
[56:44] that have just been up have just
[56:46] uprooted the greatest nation of the
[56:48] world and we're walking in dung.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're we're we're out here in
[56:53] the middle of the desert. We ain't got
[56:54] no water. We ain't got no food. I mean,
[56:57] we I mean I mean I mean it stinks out
[57:00] here. I mean, we get backed up to a Red
[57:02] Sea. We almost lose our life. And God
[57:05] comes out, miraculously, opens up the
[57:07] Red Sea, and now look at us. I mean,
[57:09] we're stuck out here and we ain't got
[57:10] none of these things. You know what? But
[57:12] but what he was trying to do was he was
[57:15] trying to show them to depend solely
[57:18] upon them. Because you think about this
[57:20] that the whole time that they're
[57:22] murdering, they're like, "Oh, you
[57:23] brought us out here that all of us that
[57:25] are going to die of thirst. Oh, you
[57:27] brought us all the way out here that all
[57:29] of us that we're going to die with
[57:30] hunger. It would it would have been
[57:32] better for been better for us to be back
[57:34] in Egypt.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know what? You you brought us
[57:37] out. Think about this. I mean, they're
[57:39] they're crying about bread and now they
[57:41] want meat.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; And they're like, Moses, IF IF WE DON'T
[57:46] GOT MEAT, it would have been better FOR
[57:47] US TO JUST DIE BACK WITH TO THE
[57:49] EGYPTIANS. AND GOD'S LIKE, I'LL GIVE YOU
[57:51] ONE BETTER. I'm going to give you mana.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; He gives us mana. And he's like, "Oh,
[57:55] GOD, WE'RE GOING TO DIE OF THIRST." AND
[57:57] GOD'S LIKE, and then he goes and splits
[57:59] a rock and brings water out of brings
[58:01] water out water OUT OF THE ROCK. HE
[58:04] EVERY SITUATION that they go through,
[58:06] God provides for them every time
[58:07] throughout the journey. Hey, man. They
[58:09] need water. GOD GOD BRINGS WATER OUT OF
[58:11] A ROCK. HOW MANY of you have you ever
[58:13] DRUNK OUT OF A rock here lately? They're
[58:16] just like, "Oh, I'm thirsty." And you
[58:18] just pick up a rock out of the dirt, out
[58:20] of the dirt, and you're just like, "Oh,
[58:21] thank you so much." Careful. Open your
[58:23] mouth. You're going to get a big dirt
[58:25] cloth.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, they walk out and
[58:29] they're walking out in the forest and
[58:30] the scripture says that they notice
[58:32] these little white things down on the
[58:33] ground.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And they interpreted it as mana.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; You walk out and How many of you have
[58:39] ever SAT DOWN AND ATE GOD'S FOOD BEFORE?
[58:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Sat down and ate angel food. What Israel
[58:46] did?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Israel had come to this point
[58:48] that and every time that they had need
[58:50] of something in their life and they were
[58:52] going through THIS JOURNEY. AMEN. GOD
[58:54] MET FOR THEM TIME and time. He was like
[58:57] SO THAT YOU KNOW.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; SO that they know so that every
[59:00] everybody THAT CAN COMES AND TELLS this
[59:03] story will be ABLE TO SAY THAT I WAS THE
[59:05] GREAT ONE THAT I PROVIDED FOR YOUR NEED
[59:07] IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDERNESS.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; YEAH. RIGHT.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; SO, they're trottting along through life
[59:13] and they start getting bit by serpents.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; For the things that they done
[59:20] &gt;&gt; and God graciously comes OUT AND BRINGS
[59:22] OUT THE brazen serpent.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; He comes out and God's providing for
[59:26] them as they come through the through
[59:28] this desert land. But then they come TO
[59:30] A POINT, A place
[59:33] &gt;&gt; called Kanesh Barnea. They come to this
[59:36] place and now now they they've come to
[59:38] they've come to there and they're just
[59:40] right there to the point where they're
[59:41] about to cross over into this promised
[59:44] land.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; They're about to cross over into this
[59:47] place to where WHERE WHERE EVERYTHING
[59:48] THAT GOD'S TALKED ABOUT IN THEIR
[59:50] PROMISES, everything that he said that
[59:52] it would be, everything that they were
[59:53] holding out for, everything that
[59:55] everything that they were going to uh
[59:57] put inside of their minds was over in
[1:00:00] this other place. AND THEY SIT 10 men.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. 10 men goes over there and they
[1:00:04] come back and they're like,
[1:00:07] "It flows with milk and honey."
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Look at these grapes.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; You know, look at these grapes. It's
[1:00:15] everything God says that it would be.
[1:00:17] It's everything that he said. Everything
[1:00:19] in in the scripture is true. Everything
[1:00:22] that he had told Abraham, everything
[1:00:24] that he told the fathers, they said
[1:00:25] they're true. But
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; we've seen the children of Anchen or
[1:00:32] Anan in there. I think it's Anan.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Anoch or you know who I'm saying.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Those guys, the real the giant ones
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; because the scripture says we look like
[1:00:43] grasshoppers in their sight.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, they begin to
[1:00:47] preach lies.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; It said the walls are are are great.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; The men are strong. He says, "I I don't
[1:00:56] know if there were that if we're able to
[1:00:58] take the city or not. We can go back. We
[1:01:00] can go on down into the scriptures." You
[1:01:03] know, we go on down in the scriptures
[1:01:08] and you could see where where he goes
[1:01:10] down and he and they talk about how that
[1:01:13] we're grasshoppers in their sight. The
[1:01:15] scripture goes on and and God says,
[1:01:19] "I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS IN the
[1:01:22] wilderness."
[1:01:24] YEAH.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS IN THE
[1:01:27] DESERT.
[1:01:28] I provided for them when they when when
[1:01:31] they had need to eat.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; I PROVIDED FOR THEM. You know, I I I
[1:01:37] BROUGHT ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU'VE DONE
[1:01:38] THESE ALL THESE THINGS TO TEMPT ME NOW.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; OKAY. He says at this point, he's like,
[1:01:46] "THERE'LL BE NOT NONE OF YOU GO go into
[1:01:48] this go into this new land except for my
[1:01:51] servants Joshua and Caleb."
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to stop right there.
[1:01:57] Just pause the story for a minute
[1:01:59] because you know what?
[1:02:01] God used Israel's life as a timeline. He
[1:02:06] used Israel as a as a reflection for us
[1:02:10] to be able to reflect in our own life,
[1:02:12] you know. And the thing is is it's not
[1:02:15] something that I could just look back
[1:02:16] and say my with my own wisdom and be
[1:02:19] able to come back and be like, "Oh, this
[1:02:21] is what this is what this really means.
[1:02:23] Israel's life is is you know what?" But
[1:02:26] all scripture now we can go back and we
[1:02:28] can find here in the scripture there in
[1:02:30] 2 Peter 1:20
[1:02:33] it says knowing this first that no
[1:02:36] prophecy of the scripture of his is of
[1:02:40] any private interpretation.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing about Israel that's
[1:02:45] that's that's that's or the stories or
[1:02:48] what or what Israel to type out is any
[1:02:51] of my private interpretation. First, the
[1:02:54] scripture says there in Amos 3:7,
[1:02:55] "Surely the Lord God will do nothing,
[1:02:58] but he revealth his secret unto his
[1:03:01] servants, the prophets."
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; So, there's nothing there's nothing
[1:03:06] there's nothing about Israel that's to
[1:03:08] be revealed that the prophet hasn't
[1:03:10] already revealed. So, now I begin to
[1:03:13] look at this at the process of Israel.
[1:03:15] Now, Israel was in Egypt.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Which is a good which would be a good
[1:03:21] type of the world.
[1:03:23] Israel.
[1:03:25] It was at the height of modern fashion.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Israel's armies were were the greatest
[1:03:31] of the of the world. It conquered the
[1:03:33] known world.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; It had knowledge. It had it had science.
[1:03:38] It had it had a a lot of things that the
[1:03:41] world looked at, you know, for to to be
[1:03:44] able to to to enhance their ability to
[1:03:47] survive.
[1:03:49] The prophet goes on and be able and says
[1:03:51] these and says this. It says, "Now they
[1:03:54] journeyied." Now they journeyed.
[1:03:56] Beautiful picture coming up out of the
[1:03:58] chaos of Egypt and out of the garlics of
[1:04:00] the pots of the world. Crossing the Red
[1:04:02] Sea, leaving the things behind, cutting
[1:04:05] loose the sh the at the shoreline as we
[1:04:08] call it today. Coming up to walk in a
[1:04:10] strange land among the strange people,
[1:04:12] serving the Lord. What a type of the
[1:04:15] conversion. leaving Egypt, sandy, barren
[1:04:19] lands to sojurnn in a wilderness among a
[1:04:22] strange people. But a promise that God
[1:04:25] would take you through. God's promise
[1:04:28] tonight when you come up out of the
[1:04:30] world and you separate yourself from all
[1:04:32] of your earthly associates and all the
[1:04:34] parties you used to go through and the
[1:04:36] worldly amusements and the drinking and
[1:04:38] the smoking and the gambling and all
[1:04:40] these things that are separated. And
[1:04:42] you're walking among strange people that
[1:04:44] you haven't known before. They say amen.
[1:04:47] And the spiritfilled believing in all
[1:04:49] things, hoping all things, waiting for
[1:04:51] the coming of the Lord, professing to be
[1:04:53] a pilgrim and a stranger, nothing of
[1:04:55] this world, don't desire it. FA are
[1:04:58] falling away from the things of this
[1:05:00] world. See what I mean? See what I'm
[1:05:02] saying? Israel being a type of the
[1:05:04] world, the world that we come out of,
[1:05:06] the world that we were stuck in and we
[1:05:08] were fashioned in and we were fashioned
[1:05:10] after. Amen. We desire the things of the
[1:05:13] world. Amen. We desire to be people of
[1:05:15] the world. We desire to have their
[1:05:17] things and and we and but yet God
[1:05:20] through the word and a promised people,
[1:05:22] God sent a prophet to the world to be
[1:05:26] able to call OUT A PEOPLE BECAUSE THOSE
[1:05:29] people that were in the world that were
[1:05:31] in that land had been promised to go to
[1:05:34] another land that was flowing with milk
[1:05:36] and honey. Amen. And today, GOD IS STILL
[1:05:40] CALLING AND HAS CALLED PEOPLE OUT OF
[1:05:43] THIS world that we live in, this Egypt,
[1:05:45] this world. HE'S CALLING THEM OUT
[1:05:47] BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROMISE TO go into.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Egypt. Amen. Those the
[1:05:53] children of Israel, they begin to move
[1:05:55] out of Egypt and they begin to go onto
[1:05:57] this journey. And again, the prophet
[1:05:59] makes mention makes mention of this
[1:06:01] again. And he says, "Oh, I've got to
[1:06:04] stop here and say something just a
[1:06:05] moment.
[1:06:07] Now again, they're journeying to the
[1:06:09] promised land.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I got to stop here on
[1:06:14] something. Just a moment. Won't take me
[1:06:16] but a minute. Many people have to uh
[1:06:19] refer to the promised land to the
[1:06:20] millennium." It's not. The promised land
[1:06:23] had wars and killings. The millennium
[1:06:25] won't have wars or killings. It's
[1:06:27] referred to the Holy Spirit, the
[1:06:30] battlegrounds, justification. They left
[1:06:33] Egypt. There's three stages to their
[1:06:36] journey. They left Egypt under
[1:06:39] justification
[1:06:41] believing the word. They separated
[1:06:43] themselves from the Egyptians and yet
[1:06:45] they came out. They crossed the Red Sea
[1:06:48] and they kill the things behind them
[1:06:50] which were sanctification through the
[1:06:52] blood that kills all human desire of
[1:06:56] eagle evil. Second stage of the journey.
[1:06:58] But the third stage was uh was when they
[1:07:02] crossed Jordan into the promised land
[1:07:04] where their inheritance land their
[1:07:07] inheritance never laid in Egypt though
[1:07:10] God blessed them in Egypt. So in other
[1:07:13] words, they're coming you come out of
[1:07:15] this world and now you're moving through
[1:07:17] justification. Amen. You've been called
[1:07:19] out by a prophet and you're on this
[1:07:21] journey and and through just
[1:07:23] injustification and through
[1:07:24] sanctification. ALONG THIS JOURNEY. GOD
[1:07:27] BLESSED you while you were on your
[1:07:29] journey.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; God blesses you while you're on your
[1:07:34] journey.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; While you're going through your drama,
[1:07:39] saying things you ain't supposed to be
[1:07:41] saying, doing things that you ain't
[1:07:43] supposed to be doing.
[1:07:45] Amen. GOD GOD CALLED YOU OUT. YOU KNOW
[1:07:48] YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO be here because
[1:07:51] THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU
[1:07:53] THAT GOD'S CHOSE YOU FOR SERVICE. WE CAN
[1:07:55] GO BACK TO THE story about the cup of
[1:07:58] the cup that was laying in the ground
[1:07:59] and how that it was selected first
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; then it was cleansed and it was put into
[1:08:04] service.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. God had selected you out of the
[1:08:08] world before the foundation of the
[1:08:11] world. GOD HAD SELECTED YOU. That's why
[1:08:14] when church came across your being, when
[1:08:16] God began to shine and hover the light
[1:08:18] over your soul, it contacted you. It be
[1:08:21] it magnetized to your heart something
[1:08:24] different than your neighbor did cuz
[1:08:26] they could care less
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; because they weren't chosen. They
[1:08:29] weren't predestinated. God didn't call
[1:08:32] them. And so you're on your journey
[1:08:34] knowing that you're supposed to be here
[1:08:36] for some reason. And now you're in a
[1:08:38] place in a situation, a state of just a
[1:08:40] sanctification where God is cleansing
[1:08:43] you up.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; GOD'S SCRAPING ALL THESE THINGS AWAY.
[1:08:48] You might have a little bit of hatred
[1:08:50] that you have to deal with. So he sends
[1:08:52] brother Donald your way.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; There might be something that you have
[1:09:00] to deal with
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; and that individual.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; HAS GOT THE RIGHT FINGER TO BE ABLE TO
[1:09:08] PUSH your buttons.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; All right. And you don't know how, but
[1:09:12] God puts YOU TWO IN THE same church.
[1:09:16] OUT OF ALL THE CHURCHES IN THE UNITED
[1:09:17] STATES TO GO TO, God puts you two in the
[1:09:20] same church because you guys have the
[1:09:22] selected fingers to touch each other's
[1:09:24] buttons
[1:09:26] to be able to pull these things up in
[1:09:29] your life THAT YOU NEED SOME SANCTIFYING
[1:09:31] IN,
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; some some shoring UP IN. AND GOD AND AND
[1:09:35] GOD he
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; that's why God gives you a pastor.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Comes to give you up and shore you up.
[1:09:46] Make sure you're sanctified.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many you love your
[1:09:51] pastor? Amen.
[1:09:57] But they come through this stage and
[1:09:58] they'd come through sanctification.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and they come to a place where God
[1:10:02] was honing them.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; And he was letting them go through every
[1:10:06] situation in their life and the stage of
[1:10:08] their journey so they can see that they
[1:10:10] didn't need the world cuz they kept
[1:10:13] going back to the world. Kept going back
[1:10:15] to the world. Kept going back to their
[1:10:16] old way of life. Kept going back to the
[1:10:18] way they used to do things. Kept going
[1:10:20] back to the old way that they made
[1:10:21] money. Kept going back to this. Kept
[1:10:23] going back to that. But yet God was
[1:10:24] like, "No, I'm going to cut them off. In
[1:10:26] fact, I'M GOING TO DROWN EVERY one of
[1:10:29] them."
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:31] I'm going to kill every last one of
[1:10:33] them. You talk about burning the bridge,
[1:10:34] God's like, I will wipe out a continent.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I will wipe out a civilization. I will
[1:10:41] make it as if the only things that that
[1:10:43] will be left in their civilization is
[1:10:45] hieroglyphics.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; I will completely obliterate them.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; From history in order for you to lean
[1:10:55] upon me.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; All right. So he said that they that
[1:10:59] they might know he provided water. They
[1:11:01] that's how you how you think that you
[1:11:03] got your rent paid.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because your drinking buddy
[1:11:08] paid your bills.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because your smoking buddy was
[1:11:13] paying your bills. It wasn't because
[1:11:15] your running buddies was running around
[1:11:16] was paying your bills. IT'S BECAUSE GOD
[1:11:18] has selected you for a purpose and he
[1:11:22] has a designed He has a designed plan
[1:11:25] for your life.
[1:11:27] Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; So he begins to cut these things off.
[1:11:33] He begins and he provided for Israel
[1:11:36] because he blessed them ALONG THE
[1:11:38] JOURNEY BUT that wasn't the place that
[1:11:40] they were meant to be.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Though they come to certain places in
[1:11:46] their experience
[1:11:47] like when water came up out of the rock.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Sure. or when God would bless a certain
[1:11:52] area, you would hear in the scriptures
[1:11:54] and it would talk about how that some
[1:11:55] stayed, how that some encamped and stuff
[1:11:58] play. You can't just stay around God's
[1:12:00] blessings. You got to become part of
[1:12:03] them.
[1:12:04] Okay.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; So they come and they come to this place
[1:12:06] where they come through sanctification
[1:12:08] but yet they come to this place called
[1:12:10] Kanesh Barnea where God had come to this
[1:12:13] place where now they had now they had
[1:12:15] sent the spies over and the and the
[1:12:17] spies had come back and God HAS BEEN HAD
[1:12:19] SAT there and he was just like he was
[1:12:21] just like YOU KNOW I'M I AM WROTH THAT I
[1:12:24] HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU STILL
[1:12:27] DON'T TRUST ME.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE THAT I CAN PAY
[1:12:32] YOUR BILLS. YEAH.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; YOU STILL DON'T believe that I can that
[1:12:36] I can heal you of your body. It doesn't
[1:12:38] matter. Amen. That if it's in your toe,
[1:12:40] it doesn't matter if it's in your knee.
[1:12:41] Doesn't matter if it's in your legs,
[1:12:43] eyes, earlobes. Amen. You might have a
[1:12:46] you might be losing your hair. Doesn't
[1:12:47] matter what IT IS. THEY STILL DON'T
[1:12:50] BELIEVE.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I DON'T EVEN WANT THEM COMING INTO THE
[1:12:53] PROMISED LAND.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; LET THEM JUST STAY HERE AND EVERY LAST
[1:12:57] ONE OF THEM DIE.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; UHOH.
[1:13:00] EVERY LAST one of them.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; You could sit here and you could talk
[1:13:03] about every blessing that you've been
[1:13:04] through. You could sit here and you
[1:13:06] could talk about how you could talk
[1:13:07] about how you know that I I was in this
[1:13:10] movement or I was part of this back in
[1:13:12] 19 whatever or this and that. BUT WHEN
[1:13:14] YOU COME TO THAT PLACE, when you come to
[1:13:17] that KANES BARNEY WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:13:18] MAKE AN ABSOLUTE BASED DECISION OFF OF
[1:13:21] WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU INTO THE PAST
[1:13:23] OR THE FEELINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING
[1:13:25] THROUGH RIGHT NOW, AMEN. YOU BETTER BE
[1:13:27] CAREFUL BECAUSE GOD WILL MAKE HIS
[1:13:29] DECISIONS TOO.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And he SAYS THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM THAT
[1:13:36] HAVE DENIED ME after what I've did, I
[1:13:39] want you to go back to the forest by the
[1:13:41] Red Sea. Uh-huh.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to possess the land.
[1:13:45] You're not going to possess the land.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You're not going to possess the land
[1:13:50] with a church mentality
[1:13:53] that you're just along for the ride.
[1:13:56] That you're just going to be here
[1:13:57] because you know what, brother so and so
[1:13:59] and sister so and so's here and and I'm
[1:14:02] just going to I'm just going to float it
[1:14:03] along these things and oh, I was a part
[1:14:05] of this when this happened and oh, I was
[1:14:07] a part of this when that happened. But
[1:14:09] when the moment come that they had to
[1:14:11] make a conscientious decision
[1:14:13] themselves, Amen. They busted,
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; okay?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Fell apart.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Fell apart after God done all these
[1:14:22] things. You listen to it. Read it. Read
[1:14:24] read ex read Exodus.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Read Leviticus.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Just crying. Just a whole bunch of
[1:14:30] crying around that's going on in the
[1:14:31] church. There a whole bunch of it. Just
[1:14:34] just blah blah blah going on.
[1:14:37] all that that that that's going on. But
[1:14:40] I don't want to leave you there.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Because if there's a part of you that's
[1:14:45] like, you know, that's not me, you're
[1:14:49] right.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; That's not you. Because you know what?
[1:14:52] The scriptures the scripture goes on
[1:14:56] right at the end of that after after God
[1:14:59] goes on and he says, "You know what? Not
[1:15:00] a one of you is going to make it." I
[1:15:02] mean, every one of you, I want you to go
[1:15:04] back and I want you to just go basically
[1:15:07] just want you to go die.
[1:15:14] What he said, just go die.
[1:15:18] Numbers 14:24,
[1:15:23] he says, "But my servant Caleb." Oh,
[1:15:27] this is your way out. This is your way
[1:15:29] out. He says, "But my servant Caleb,"
[1:15:32] because he had another spirit
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; within him, and he followed me fully.
[1:15:41] Him will I bring unto the land, wherein
[1:15:44] he went, and his seed s shall possess
[1:15:48] us. Now, if you look and you go read the
[1:15:50] verses that was before it, the other
[1:15:52] eight of those men had went out and they
[1:15:55] gave an evil report. But Caleb had come
[1:15:58] out and he Caleb and Joshua, they were
[1:16:00] like, "Wait a minute." But don't you
[1:16:01] think that if God had done this and if
[1:16:03] God had done that and if God had done
[1:16:05] these things and God had done all these
[1:16:07] other things that he would that he would
[1:16:09] that he would uh that he would come and
[1:16:11] he would deliver us, amen, from these
[1:16:14] giants and he would come and he would
[1:16:15] deliver US FROM THESE. NOW, THAT IS WHAT
[1:16:18] YOUR TYPE is here this evening. It's the
[1:16:20] believer, amen, that solely stands upon
[1:16:24] the WORD OF GOD REGARDLESS OF THE
[1:16:27] CIRCUMSTANCES. AMEN. And you come to
[1:16:29] that place where you can fully rest.
[1:16:32] Now, I'd like to bring this I'd like to
[1:16:34] bring this here. This this little quote,
[1:16:36] this little quote here. It says
[1:16:39] it says,
[1:16:41] "They are like the children of Israel
[1:16:43] who came up out of Egypt and stopped
[1:16:46] short of the promised land."
[1:16:48] Now those children of Israel left Egypt
[1:16:51] about 2 million strong and THEY
[1:16:53] JOURNEYED TOGETHER. ALL SAW the mira the
[1:16:55] same miracles of God. All part par part
[1:16:57] par part par part par part par part par
[1:16:57] part par part par part par part par
[1:16:57] parttook of the same mana from the water
[1:16:59] from the smitten rock and followed the
[1:17:01] same cloud by day and the pillar of
[1:17:03] power of uh the pillar of fire by night.
[1:17:06] But only two reached the promised land.
[1:17:09] Only two were the real believers. That
[1:17:11] is correct because the word tells us
[1:17:14] that the rest died because of their
[1:17:16] unbelief and because of unbelief they
[1:17:18] could not enter in. Hebrews 13 3 and 19
[1:17:21] this uh then since that is is so the
[1:17:25] only two entered then the rest were not
[1:17:28] true believers. What made the
[1:17:31] difference? Two stayed with the word.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Two stayed with the word. When the
[1:17:37] hearts of the 10 spies failed for the
[1:17:40] kanes barneas, two stayed with the word.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; You staying with the word against the
[1:17:46] doctor's report regardless of how many
[1:17:49] MILLIONS OF DOCTORS MEDICAL science
[1:17:52] reports have come back. You stand with
[1:17:54] the word of God.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Okay? Two stayed with the word. And when
[1:17:59] the hearts of the 10 spies failed at
[1:18:01] Kanis Barnea, Joshua and Caleb did not
[1:18:03] stagger. For they believed the word and
[1:18:06] said, "We are more than able to take the
[1:18:09] land." They knew they could because God
[1:18:11] had said, "I have given you the land."
[1:18:14] After all the Israelites saw the power
[1:18:16] and the goodness and he and he and
[1:18:19] delivered and deliverance of God, they
[1:18:22] did not enter into rest.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:18:27] After what WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE
[1:18:30] DELIVERANCES?
[1:18:32] What was the purpose of God manifesting
[1:18:36] himself singly one on-one?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; One on-one with Israel.
[1:18:43] No if ends or buts ABOUT IT. IT WAS THEM
[1:18:46] GOD. IT WAS SO that he could put he
[1:18:49] could put their minds solely TO REST
[1:18:54] THAT GOD WOULD PROVIDE. YEAH.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; After all those saw the power and the
[1:19:00] goodness and the deliverance of God,
[1:19:01] they did not enter into rest, which is a
[1:19:05] type of the Holy Ghost. What was the
[1:19:08] type of the Holy Ghost? And it wasn't it
[1:19:10] wasn't or what was the type of what was
[1:19:13] a type of the promised land? The Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; They entered into rest. They did not
[1:19:19] enter into the rest of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:22] The full surrender. Amen. that God would
[1:19:25] be able to provide for their needs.
[1:19:27] Therefore, God turned them around. AMEN.
[1:19:29] AND BASICALLY TRY AGAIN.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Stood up to the border. Are we at the
[1:19:36] border of Arcanes Barney here this
[1:19:38] evening? Amen. Where we come to the
[1:19:40] point where we have to be able to look
[1:19:42] at the true facts of what God has done
[1:19:45] in the day that we live in. Not only in
[1:19:47] the past in the prophets's age, but but
[1:19:50] every miracle that we could go down go
[1:19:53] down every row in this service. We could
[1:19:55] GO WHERE JOE SANDERS where his boy was
[1:19:58] healed as a young as a young boy. Amen.
[1:20:00] We prayed for in the church and got
[1:20:02] healed. Amen. That young boy and he's
[1:20:04] alive here today. Amen. We got our we
[1:20:07] got our sister Katrina. She had problems
[1:20:09] with her arms. Amen. And God healed her
[1:20:11] arm. Amen. In the middle of the service.
[1:20:14] Amen. We got our other uh where it was
[1:20:16] with Annne Martin where God put a socket
[1:20:19] back in the hip. Amen. Of that young
[1:20:22] girl. We've got Sister Carol where she
[1:20:24] was healed of cancer IN HER BODY. WE'VE
[1:20:26] GOT JOE AND STEPHANIE where the liver
[1:20:29] was brought back and God delivered.
[1:20:31] Amen. His his life. AMEN. AND HE'S
[1:20:34] SERVING GOD HERE TODAY. ARE WE GOING TO
[1:20:36] WALK UP TO THE KANES BARNEA OF OUR LIFE?
[1:20:39] AND ARE WE GOING TO DENY THE WORKS OF
[1:20:42] GOD? AMEN. ARE WE GOING TO ENTER INTO
[1:20:45] THE PROMISED LAND OF the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:48] THE ASSURANCE AND THE REST, AMEN, that
[1:20:50] God has for us? The land is yours. IT'S
[1:20:53] BEEN PROMISED BY GOD. AMEN. YOU'VE BEEN
[1:20:55] PREDESTINATED AND YOU HAVE A PLACE AND
[1:20:58] YOU HAVE A PURPOSE. AMEN. You just got
[1:21:00] to walk into it.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, it was a different it
[1:21:06] was a different ballgame. You know what?
[1:21:07] There there comes a time, amen, where
[1:21:10] all those old unbelievers, they died
[1:21:12] off. You know, there comes a time where
[1:21:14] all those old warriors, they died off.
[1:21:16] And there was a new crop, but there was
[1:21:18] a new generation of warriors that what
[1:21:20] that had that had rose up and you know
[1:21:22] what? But the old warriors, oh Joshua
[1:21:24] and Caleb, though they were old in their
[1:21:26] life and though they had gone through
[1:21:28] certain things in their life, Amen. They
[1:21:31] were still just as able, they said, in
[1:21:33] the time they were 80 years old to be
[1:21:35] able to take the mountain as they was
[1:21:37] when the promise was first given. Amen.
[1:21:39] And you might be marching in the land.
[1:21:41] You might be sitting here. Amen. You you
[1:21:44] might stepped over from Kanes Barney and
[1:21:46] you're into your promised land. Now
[1:21:48] remember,
[1:21:50] I ain't preaching flowers.
[1:21:54] I ain't preaching free cell phone and a
[1:21:57] and a and a 32 ounce from Quick Trip.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; God's God's GOD'S GOING TO STILL MAKE
[1:22:05] YOU GO THROUGH THINGS BECAUSE THERE WAS
[1:22:07] FIGHTING THAT was going on in the
[1:22:08] promised land.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; There was fighting that was going on.
[1:22:14] They didn't cross over into the promised
[1:22:16] land. You didn't get filled with the
[1:22:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost AND YOU'RE
[1:22:19] LIKE, "OH, I've arrived
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; again."
[1:22:23] Yeah.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; You just now found out who you are.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; You've just now found out THAT
[1:22:29] EVERYTHING THAT GOD'S BEEN TRAINING me
[1:22:31] in the desert to believe on him and to
[1:22:33] lean on him. Amen. Now that I've entered
[1:22:36] into a full rest, but but you don't
[1:22:39] desire the things of the world.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Because the things that are the things
[1:22:47] that were in the desert on the journey,
[1:22:50] those things are to stay there. all the
[1:22:52] fashion
[1:22:53] and all your all your lust for money and
[1:22:56] all your desire to be like the next
[1:22:58] person and and all your desires, your
[1:23:01] ambitions and those things that that if
[1:23:03] it's contrary to the word of God. Amen.
[1:23:05] That's not in God's plan. Amen. You just

[1:23:10] Amen. And you get by with just the
[1:23:12] things that you just the things that you
[1:23:14] need in this world. Of course, you need
[1:23:16] some shoes and you need a jacket and
[1:23:18] please get a haircut.
[1:23:21] You're going to need those things. But
[1:23:23] this is just a wilderness that we're
[1:23:25] passing through. God's given you a
[1:23:26] promised land. Amen. And if you're
[1:23:28] abiding in the word,
[1:23:31] if you're FILLED WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE
[1:23:34] Holy Ghost, Amen. And you abide in the
[1:23:36] word and CHRIST THE WORD ABIDES IN YOU.
[1:23:38] AMEN. Then you're entitled TO EVERYTHING
[1:23:41] THAT'S IN THE PROMISED LAND. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:23:44] There might be disease that you're
[1:23:46] standing against. That might be a
[1:23:47] Hittite.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Okay? You might be looking at financial
[1:23:51] situations in your life that might be a
[1:23:53] Jebusite.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might be looking at family
[1:23:57] troubles in your sight and in your life
[1:23:59] that MIGHT BE A PARASITE. BUT THE THING
[1:24:01] WAS IS GOD HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP THEIR
[1:24:04] LAND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:24:08] AMEN. And that HEALTH IS YOURS AND
[1:24:10] FINANCES YOURS IS YOURS. AMEN. AND

[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; I like this right here. And he says, "My
[1:24:27] now,
[1:24:28] it's your job to figure it out how I
[1:24:32] look at it in my life. I'm 36 years old,
[1:24:35] you know, and tell him how much more
[1:24:36] longer I got. I'm going to acquire
[1:24:37] things as I go. And I'm gonna acquire
[1:24:40] these things, you know, and Lord
[1:24:41] willing, it's going to be left to my
[1:24:42] children. and I ain't going to have time
[1:24:44] to just sit there and just be able to
[1:24:46] point out every little thing that I
[1:24:47] have. They're going to have to find it
[1:24:48] out themselves,
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; They're just going to have to go into
[1:24:51] the think tank there at 550 Illinois and
[1:24:54] just try to figure out what I was doing
[1:24:56] here and what I was doing here, what
[1:24:58] this tool's used for and what that
[1:25:00] tool's used for and is that even a tool,
[1:25:03] you know, or or you know, he's going to
[1:25:05] figure out all these things. It's their
[1:25:06] job to be able to go through and to
[1:25:08] discover and to be able to find these
[1:25:09] things. what I've been doing these past
[1:25:11] several years and or lot you know past
[1:25:13] long time been doing these things and
[1:25:15] and you know it's your job to get into
[1:25:17] the scripture and it's your job to get
[1:25:18] into the Bible and it's your job to be
[1:25:20] able to get into the messages of the
[1:25:22] hour and to be able to find out what's
[1:25:23] in your promised land it's your job to
[1:25:26] be able to go out the prophet says this
[1:25:28] it says my could you buy a house without
[1:25:30] looking through it
[1:25:33] not going to happen in my house
[1:25:36] ain't a ain't going to happen could you
[1:25:39] buy a house and and you go look and not
[1:25:41] do anything or and not go go without
[1:25:44] looking through it. It says if I own
[1:25:46] anything, I want to look around. You
[1:25:48] know, the Holy Ghost is like a big
[1:25:50] arcade.
[1:25:54] You know that what an arcade is? It's
[1:25:57] you know what an arcade is and you're
[1:25:59] baptized into it. Now, if I own an
[1:26:01] arcade, I want to go and to the shelf
[1:26:04] and to see what I own. Look around. Look
[1:26:07] at this. I if something seems to be a
[1:26:09] little high, get me a ladder and climb
[1:26:12] up to it and look around to see what
[1:26:13] belongs to me. And that's the way you
[1:26:15] ought to do as a Christian. Look through
[1:26:17] the Bible and see what the promise is.
[1:26:19] Every one of them is to the believer.
[1:26:21] Amen. Remember when we used to sing the
[1:26:24] song way before or way before we
[1:26:27] backslide. Every promise in the book is
[1:26:29] mine. Every chapter and every verse and
[1:26:31] every line is trusting in his love
[1:26:33] divine. Every promise in the book is
[1:26:35] mine. And that's exactly where we are
[1:26:37] here today in the word that we have
[1:26:40] here. Here here is we've been given the
[1:26:42] word by God. He's called us out and he's
[1:26:44] marching us into the promised land of
[1:26:46] the Holy Ghost. Amen. And that land is
[1:26:49] yours as much as you want to believe it.
[1:26:52] Amen. If you want to stand up and you
[1:26:54] want to look over every last inch of it
[1:26:56] of it. Amen. You can. You can take the
[1:26:59] word of God. Amen. It's your
[1:27:01] inheritance. It's your inheritance to be
[1:27:03] able to look, amen, at God's word and be
[1:27:05] able to say, you know what, Father, I'm
[1:27:07] going to take what's mine, Amen. Doesn't
[1:27:09] matter how old I am. It doesn't matter
[1:27:11] how inexperienced it seems that that it
[1:27:14] seems that I am, but God, I'm taking
[1:27:16] your word because I abide in your word
[1:27:18] and your word abides in me. Lord, lead
[1:27:21] me to the promise and let me take my
[1:27:24] land. Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; As our musicians come,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:27:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:32] And you know, I
[1:27:35] I think here that
[1:27:38] Israel's life has always been a great
[1:27:40] blessing to me because
[1:27:44] it God uses these things and not only
[1:27:47] just having the words on page of
[1:27:50] Israel's life, but having
[1:27:53] the light of the message that we have to
[1:27:55] be able to come and be able to see why
[1:27:57] God put these things through, put Israel
[1:28:00] through through these things so we could
[1:28:03] see in our life why God puts us through
[1:28:05] things
[1:28:07] to be able to see the plan of God.
[1:28:10] And here this evening, you might be
[1:28:12] staring at a giant.
[1:28:16] You might be looking at a walled city.
[1:28:20] You might be lacking some things in your
[1:28:23] experience.
[1:28:25] But don't fear. God's already promised
[1:28:29] you your land. And you could take God's
[1:28:32] promise and you can live below your
[1:28:35] means. But brother,
[1:28:38] I'd rather take God's word and be able
[1:28:39] to say, "You know what, Lord? Let that
[1:28:42] be your will for my life."
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Every word that's preached by the
[1:28:47] ministers, every song that's sung, Lord,
[1:28:50] let that be my life. Let me not stand at
[1:28:53] that place.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; And because of what I think, I deny your
[1:28:59] word.
[1:29:02] Maybe God might be moving upon you
[1:29:05] to use you in a greater light in
[1:29:07] ministry or be able to use you in a
[1:29:09] greater light of your family.
[1:29:13] That's your promise.
[1:29:17] Israel went into a lot of different
[1:29:19] places in the promised land and there
[1:29:21] was a lot of walled cities, giants, and
[1:29:24] just it seemed to be just unbelievable
[1:29:28] odds against them. But yet God came down
[1:29:30] time and time again and proved himself
[1:29:34] real. And every one of us can go to
[1:29:36] situations that's been that we've been
[1:29:39] surrounded by miracles and things that's
[1:29:41] been done in people's life and we could
[1:29:43] sit back and we could say, "God was real
[1:29:46] here. God was real there. Now it's time
[1:29:49] to take that thing and be able to look
[1:29:51] at it. Maybe God's trying to show me
[1:29:52] something. Maybe I've gone through this
[1:29:55] entire life and I've seen all these
[1:29:56] things to be able to see these things
[1:29:58] because you know what? I'm to take them
[1:30:01] and apply them to my life.
[1:30:04] My healing is not only just for me, but
[1:30:06] it's to show you that he's real.
[1:30:10] God, your testimony in your life is not
[1:30:13] just for you, but for your neighbors to
[1:30:14] show them that they're real or that he's
[1:30:17] real.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] Through it all,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; And I learned to trust in God
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; through it all.
[1:30:49] Through it all,
[1:30:54] I learned to depend upon his word.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; I have many tears of sorrows.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I've had questions for tomorrow.
[1:31:16] Many times I didn't know right from
[1:31:20] wrong.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:26] But in every situation,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; God gave blessing
[1:31:34] consolation
[1:31:36] that my trials come to make sure.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, through it all.
[1:31:51] Through it all,
[1:31:56] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:32:01] I've learned to trust in God.
[1:32:07] Through it all,
[1:32:12] through it all,
[1:32:17] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[1:32:28] I've been a lot of places
[1:32:33] and I've seen a lot of faces.
[1:32:38] There were times I felt so all alone.
[1:32:49] But in my lonely hours,
[1:32:54] yes, those precious lonely hours,
[1:32:59] Jesus let me know I'm still his own.
[1:33:07] Oh, through it all.
[1:33:13] Through it all,
[1:33:18] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:33:23] I've learned to trust in God.
[1:33:28] Through it all,
[1:33:33] through it all,
[1:33:38] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[1:33:47] So I thank God for the mountains
[1:33:52] and I thank him for the valleyies
[1:33:57] and I thank him for the storms he's
[1:34:02] brought me through.
[1:34:07] Or if I've never had a problem,
[1:34:13] I wouldn't know that he could solve it.
[1:34:18] I wouldn't know what faith in God will
[1:34:22] do.
[1:34:26] Oh, through it all.
[1:34:32] Through it all,
[1:34:36] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:34:41] I've learned to trust in God.
[1:34:46] Through it all,
[1:34:51] through it all,
[1:34:55] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[1:35:04] Amen.
[1:35:06] I'd like to just finish up maybe with
[1:35:08] this one quote here
[1:35:10] and we were talking about how Joshua and
[1:35:12] Caleb had went over into the promised
[1:35:13] land and now how that they went over and
[1:35:15] they'd come back with the evidence.
[1:35:18] Brother Brandham says this. He says just
[1:35:20] like Joshua and Caleb brought back the
[1:35:23] evidence of the unseen land that had
[1:35:26] been given to the people by a promise.
[1:35:28] Joshua and Caleb brought back an
[1:35:30] evidence that there was such a land. Now
[1:35:33] down there they had the promise of it.
[1:35:35] God gave them the promise and they came
[1:35:37] right back up to the land, but they had
[1:35:39] never seen it. And Joshua and Caleb had
[1:35:41] went over into the promised land and
[1:35:42] brought back the evidence that the land
[1:35:44] was there and it was a good place
[1:35:46] flowing with milk and honey. Amen.
[1:35:49] There,
[1:35:51] what was it? They were going to possess
[1:35:53] the land. They had the promise that was
[1:35:56] on their road over there and they were
[1:35:58] almost to Jordan and Joshua crossed over
[1:36:00] and brought back the evidence that it
[1:36:02] was a good land just what Joshua did for
[1:36:05] the children of Israel. Joshua means
[1:36:09] savior. The word Joshua and that's the
[1:36:12] same thing Jesus done for the church
[1:36:14] when they killed him. He conquered
[1:36:17] death. He conquered hell. He conquered
[1:36:20] the grave. And he rose up again with the
[1:36:23] evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:26] That was the evidence, the baptism of
[1:36:28] the Holy Ghost, that there is a land
[1:36:31] beyond the river that they call the
[1:36:33] sweet forever. Amen. He come back and
[1:36:36] brought us the evidence. What does it
[1:36:38] do, brother Brandham? Makes you stop
[1:36:40] your lying, stealing, drinking, cussing,
[1:36:44] immoral, everything, and makes you a new
[1:36:45] creation out of you. I who were once
[1:36:48] dead in trespasses, nevertheless I live.
[1:36:50] Not me, but Christ lives in me. I'm a
[1:36:53] new creature creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:36:57] Amen. Heir to his promise. Hallelujah.
[1:36:59] That land belongs to us. How do you know
[1:37:02] it? Joshua rose from Joshua rose from
[1:37:05] the dead, brought back the or Joshua
[1:37:08] rose up, brought back the evidence, the
[1:37:10] Holy Ghost. I got it. Amen. Glory. I'm
[1:37:13] an heir. The child of the king. a child
[1:37:15] of the king to all things. The Bible
[1:37:18] says so. Amen. God bless you here this
[1:37:21] evening. So, we turn it over to our
[1:37:23] pastor. Amen.
[1:37:35] Through it all.
[1:37:40] Through it all.
[1:37:44] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:37:49] I learned to trust in God.
[1:37:54] Through it all,
[1:37:58] for through it all,
[1:38:03] I've learned
[1:38:05] to depend
[1:38:08] upon his word.
[1:38:12] Amen.
[1:38:14] I like that song.
[1:38:18] That was a song mom, dad sung for so
[1:38:21] many, many years.
[1:38:25] And I've I've seen that witness in their
[1:38:27] lives. And and u
[1:38:32] I uh I've seen it in my life as well.
[1:38:36] The older the older
[1:38:39] a guy gets, the more he looks back at
[1:38:42] the faithfulness of the Lord.
[1:38:45] And
[1:38:48] as brother Michael was saying, you've
[1:38:50] got your
[1:38:54] stages in your life. You've got
[1:38:55] justification,
[1:38:57] and that's that's a wonderful stage.
[1:38:59] That's that's
[1:39:01] and you never you never outgrow
[1:39:04] justification.
[1:39:06] But you've got to move on to
[1:39:07] sanctification and you've got to be a
[1:39:09] live a he's got to work through your
[1:39:12] life. And that
[1:39:15] and and that's that's one of the reasons
[1:39:16] I
[1:39:19] you know
[1:39:21] I've uh I've always loved
[1:39:26] uh
[1:39:28] new converts loved young people.
[1:39:31] And you go through those stages
[1:39:35] and and God will put you in in in areas
[1:39:38] of your life to where it's not
[1:39:41] comfortable.
[1:39:43] And and as a young person, lots of times
[1:39:46] you think that
[1:39:49] maybe you're not a Christian or maybe
[1:39:51] it's not you're not cut out for the job.
[1:39:55] We we talk about God choosing so much
[1:39:57] and you think I must have been the guy
[1:39:59] that he hasn't chosen. Well, his call is
[1:40:03] for whosoever will.
[1:40:06] And the fact is, if there's something in
[1:40:08] your heart that that is saying, I love
[1:40:13] the Lord
[1:40:15] and I I'm I'm really in a grind right
[1:40:17] now. I'm in a
[1:40:21] my my spirit's messed up. My
[1:40:25] I'm struggling with with Maybe it might
[1:40:28] be a lie lying. Maybe you you're you're
[1:40:30] fighting a lying devil. Maybe you're
[1:40:32] fighting a I I you know what whatever
[1:40:35] devil I you know and uh
[1:40:40] you know and you'll hear these kind of
[1:40:43] messages
[1:40:45] of overcoming and fighting your fight.
[1:40:48] And and that's what you're supposed to
[1:40:50] do. That's what these messages are for
[1:40:53] is to put a put a little bit of grit in
[1:40:56] your in your belly. a little little
[1:40:58] something to make you stand up and say,
[1:41:01] you know, this is worth fighting for.
[1:41:04] This is who I am. You know, you might
[1:41:07] have messed up this morning, but I'm up
[1:41:09] right now and I'm going to fight. And
[1:41:12] five minutes later, you might be back
[1:41:13] down on the ground again. Get back up.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Keep that sword up.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Keep blood on your sword.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Keep on fighting. Yeah, you might be
[1:41:24] gushing blood, too. Amen. But that's all
[1:41:27] right. Get up.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; I I love the fact that, you know,
[1:41:32] there's no reports. There's there's no
[1:41:34] reports that there was even a Red Cross
[1:41:38] followed the those guys when they
[1:41:40] entered into the promised land. And yet,
[1:41:42] they were doing all of that fighting. In
[1:41:44] fact, when they did lose a couple of
[1:41:46] guys, I think they lost 17 guys if if
[1:41:49] I'm remembering right. and and JOSHUA
[1:41:53] STOPS THE WHOLE BATTLE, STOPS the whole
[1:41:55] campaign, retreats, and says, "All
[1:41:57] right, something's going on. We've got
[1:42:00] sin in the camp somewhere. We've got
[1:42:02] some rebellion going on against the word
[1:42:04] of the Lord." And then when they drew
[1:42:06] the lot, that's when they found Achen
[1:42:08] who was hiding a golden wedge and a and
[1:42:10] a garment and and uh and and and they
[1:42:15] they had to eradicate the sin.
[1:42:18] So, so I guess what I'm saying is the
[1:42:21] battle is very real. You can have the
[1:42:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost and be
[1:42:26] fighting battles,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; but there ain't no winning and there
[1:42:30] ain't no coming out. Amen. Until you've
[1:42:33] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:42:35] you've got to have the Holy Ghost. It
[1:42:38] it's Pentecost today has made the Holy
[1:42:41] Ghost. You know, anointing is is
[1:42:43] something that you feel and and it and
[1:42:46] and and I love emotion. And when you get
[1:42:48] into the presence of God, you do feel
[1:42:50] it.
[1:42:51] But I'm telling you what, amen. I know
[1:42:54] the presence of God has been near me
[1:42:55] many of times. And and and I've not felt
[1:42:58] like running and dancing and speaking in
[1:43:00] tongues.
[1:43:02] That's right. The Holy Ghost is given to
[1:43:04] us as an assurance. As brother Michael
[1:43:06] was saying, arrest. There is a rest. I
[1:43:09] belong in this land. This word is mine.
[1:43:13] I will take my mountain. I will. I
[1:43:16] refuse to back down. And I don't care if
[1:43:19] you've been fighting that same old
[1:43:21] cottonpicking giant for the last three
[1:43:24] months. Keep on fighting that giant
[1:43:27] because he's on your land.
[1:43:30] That is your ground. That is your
[1:43:32] promise. You can have it. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:36] And I say that here today. And uh so I I
[1:43:41] give I you know I I've always given
[1:43:43] grace, a lot of grace to to to young
[1:43:47] people. Amen. And uh uh I want you young
[1:43:52] men and young women to know that that uh
[1:43:56] we're behind you 100%.
[1:43:59] We're we're we're behind you, man. I I I
[1:44:02] I
[1:44:03] Hallelujah. You ever need someone to
[1:44:05] listen to or or or or some someone to
[1:44:08] talk to, you do end up listening when
[1:44:10] you come to me. Amen. But uh uh but but
[1:44:14] but but you know, find a way to get a
[1:44:17] hold of me and and and you know, if we
[1:44:19] need to go get a malt or go get a shake
[1:44:21] or something. Amen. Or or or and and I
[1:44:24] believe that's the way it is for all
[1:44:26] these elders. I believe all of these men
[1:44:28] and women would listen to any of you.
[1:44:30] You you need you need someone to talk
[1:44:32] to. Uh don't fight your battle alone and
[1:44:35] don't feel like you're you're all alone.
[1:44:37] Amen. Because I'm telling you right now,
[1:44:40] there are some folks that's been in this
[1:44:42] been in this promised land for a while
[1:44:44] and they know some in-n-outs on fighting
[1:44:46] giants. Amen. And and uh uh you know you
[1:44:51] you you you got in trouble here, you get
[1:44:53] in trouble there. Listen to me. Listen
[1:44:55] to me. Amen. You're going to win. You're
[1:44:59] going to win. God's with us.
[1:45:04] Hallelujah.
[1:45:06] You know, growing up is tough. Growing
[1:45:08] up is tough. It's it's it's hard. It's
[1:45:11] hard being a teenager. Amen.
[1:45:13] Transitioning into a man or a woman and
[1:45:16] and a lot of emotions that goes in, a
[1:45:18] lot of things you don't quite see. And
[1:45:20] it takes a little while. Hey, listen.
[1:45:22] you know, you're you're trying to find
[1:45:25] who you are as a young person, as a man
[1:45:28] or a young woman, and you're also, amen,
[1:45:31] trying to find your position in Christ.
[1:45:33] And uh uh it it can be tough. It can be
[1:45:37] tough. But but uh I'm here to tell you
[1:45:39] right now, we're all winners. I made it
[1:45:43] well. And I guess the rest of us did,
[1:45:44] too. And so, Amen. Every one of you
[1:45:47] young men, every one of you young
[1:45:49] ladies, you just know that this preacher
[1:45:52] is not pointing any fingers cuz I can
[1:45:55] remember it's I can like yesterday the
[1:45:58] struggles I went through as a young man
[1:46:00] and the struggles I've gone through.
[1:46:02] Amen. Coming all the way up to where I'm
[1:46:04] at right now. The greatest thing, the
[1:46:07] greatest asset to anything in God is
[1:46:11] have a willing heart to admit when
[1:46:13] you're wrong and admit when when you
[1:46:15] need to be raw, be raw, man. Be raw.
[1:46:18] What I mean by raw is is just
[1:46:23] if you're confused, tell God about it.
[1:46:26] I I if if you're needing I mean talk to
[1:46:29] God. Let let go let let let let let let

[1:46:32] think he's real and then let God come
[1:46:35] back and talk to you.
[1:46:39] Amen. Well, there's a lot there's a lot
[1:46:42] of young men even, you know, there's a
[1:46:45] lot of young people that that that that
[1:46:48] struggle so hard in their mind trying to
[1:46:51] figure out. Amen. And it's it's it's
[1:46:55] good to have some elders that that says,
[1:46:57] "Hey, buddy been there. You're going to
[1:47:00] make it. You're going to make it." Is
[1:47:03] that right?
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. For what's that worth? Amen. So, I
[1:47:08] I got to thinking about that when
[1:47:10] Brother Michael was was preaching along
[1:47:11] at lines because Amen.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; sanctification is a is a process.
[1:47:17] Baptism of the Holy Ghost is Amen. And

[1:47:28] just been equipped to fight.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So get the Holy Ghost. Amen. Get
[1:47:38] the Holy Ghost. And uh uh I think I

[1:47:48] put us in a spot to we realize that we
[1:47:52] need God. Well, glory to God. You enjoy

[1:48:08] converts and love young people. And uh I
[1:48:12] just want you to know I as as as pastor
[1:48:15] I I'm praying for you, believing for
[1:48:18] you, pulling for you. Amen.

[1:48:29] And see, in Pentecost, we we uh we as
[1:48:32] preachers, we're always taught you never
[1:48:34] be around the people. And then always, I
[1:48:37] mean, you just got to you just got to
[1:48:39] look perfect. You can't you can't look
[1:48:40] like you're human because if you look
[1:48:42] human, people's going to lose the
[1:48:45] respect in you. And uh well,
[1:48:49] I lost the respect in them. Amen. with
[1:48:52] them guys trying to look superhuman and
[1:48:55] super spiritual and then uh couldn't
[1:48:58] admit that they were
[1:49:01] hallelujah but they had problems and and
[1:49:05] so we don't we don't want anyone around
[1:49:07] here looking like we ain't got problems
[1:49:10] we've all got problems
[1:49:13] and God's led us the way that he's led
[1:49:16] us because
[1:49:18] he wants us as Michael said he put it
[1:49:20] good rely on him. He wants us to rely on
[1:49:26] him. Is that right? Praise the Lord.
[1:49:30] Well, glory to God. So, I guess until we
[1:49:33] get on the other side, we're going to be
[1:49:35] humans. Amen. And and but we're going to
[1:49:38] have the we're going to have the
