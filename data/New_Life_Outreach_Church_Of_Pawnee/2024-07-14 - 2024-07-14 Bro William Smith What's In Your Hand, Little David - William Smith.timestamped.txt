[35:57] and he'll go out fighting for
[36:00] you praise the Lord you may be seated
[36:02] for a
[36:06] moment I uh wanted to give a
[36:10] testimony of the six weeks I've been
[36:15] gone and
[36:17] uh some here knew
[36:20] that the work here just kind of like
[36:23] stopped for a little while and still has
[36:26] stopped
[36:28] and so I went out to minister with
[36:32] brother Dale and
[36:35] um he wanted me to go by a little town
[36:38] called shello to minister to them
[36:42] because they don't have a
[36:43] pastor and so the little brother Craig
[36:47] he called me and uh we went and
[36:51] ministered for
[36:52] them and by the time I got back here I
[36:56] had a real
[36:58] strong burden for
[37:01] them I couldn't
[37:04] sleep um so I came to brother wendle and
[37:09] we
[37:10] talked and uh and so I was supposed to
[37:15] go out there and just preach one
[37:18] service but the lord gave me the
[37:20] opportunity to
[37:22] preach almost every weekend while I was
[37:25] gone except the meeting at brother
[37:27] brother manuels we went
[37:30] there um and um one service I went and
[37:34] they already had somebody there and he
[37:36] was going to councel it and I said no no
[37:39] let him preach I just want to be here
[37:42] with
[37:44] you and
[37:46] so they have asked a lot of
[37:49] questions the Lord did a lot of
[37:52] wonderful things
[37:55] there and
[37:58] January uh July the
[38:01] 7th they asked
[38:04] me if I would be their
[38:08] pastor and
[38:11] so
[38:13] I told them that I'll be back in a
[38:18] couple of weeks to finish some work at
[38:21] my wife's aunt's
[38:23] house and I would come and be with them
[38:26] for a couple of weeks and
[38:28] let them ask questions I can ask some
[38:31] questions each and every one of them had
[38:34] come up to me in the time I was there
[38:36] and asked me if I was going to move
[38:39] here be their pastor and I stayed very
[38:42] neutral as brother Wendell asked me
[38:44] to let God lead this if it's God
[38:49] something will happen if not I could be
[38:52] like in the Bible where the
[38:57] I think it was John and or it was Peter
[39:01] and them sent some of the men that were
[39:03] ministers to a country and they
[39:05] ministered until they got a
[39:08] pastor at that time I didn't
[39:11] know this pool that I had for them but
[39:15] since then my heart has been very heavy
[39:18] for that
[39:20] group and
[39:23] so we're going to go and and uh be with
[39:27] them for for the whole next month until
[39:31] I finish that
[39:33] job and I just wanted you guys to be
[39:35] updated to to know what's going on CU I
[39:40] know there was some here that was
[39:41] wondering why have you been gone so long
[39:44] and uh some of you knew that I wasn't
[39:48] called to be
[39:50] evangelist this 6 weeks of going back
[39:52] and forth from Albuquerque there was 4
[39:56] hours there and four hours back and I
[39:58] want to tell you my hat comes off of
[40:00] every man that feels that he's a uh a
[40:04] missionary
[40:06] or a guy that goes out and ministers and
[40:09] loves to minister on the road I I
[40:13] couldn't do that very long and so I just

[45:29] before the foundations of the
[45:32] world gave us a Bible so that we can
[45:35] read your
[45:37] words and the Holy Spirit can come and
[45:40] reveal it to
[45:43] us
[45:45] Lord the five-fold ministry could preach
[45:49] it but Lord it takes you to
[45:52] come and reveal it to your babes
[45:58] and Lord I just ask you this evening
[46:00] Lord as we heard a masterpiece this
[46:03] morning to take these little words
[46:06] father God
[46:07] and speak to your children
[46:11] Lord L we just love you we thank
[46:15] you in jesus' name we
[46:18] pray
[46:20] amen praise the Lord if we can open our
[46:23] Bibles to Exodus 4 then we're going to
[46:27] go to Ephesians
[46:31] 6 the little church there did want me to
[46:35] say God bless brother Wendell and
[46:40] brother durren and the
[46:42] church and uh they uh was so excited
[46:47] that when they all found out that I come
[46:50] from Brother windle's church and and uh
[46:54] there's one man in this church that's
[46:56] not here this morning or this evening
[46:59] that they really love and that's brother
[47:02] Duren they think a whole lot about
[47:05] brother Duren and his wife and and uh if
[47:08] they could have had their way they
[47:10] wouldn't have never let them get out of
[47:13] Arizona and so but here in Exodus 4 and
[47:18] one it says and Moses answered and said
[47:21] but behold they will not believe me nor
[47:25] hearken unto my voice
[47:27] for they will say
[47:29] Lord the Lord has not appeared unto thee
[47:33] and the Lord said unto him
[47:36] now God speaking to Moses and
[47:41] now we all know that he's up there by
[47:44] the burning bush and now he's telling
[47:49] God that they're not going to believe
[47:52] him but God didn't answer his question
[47:56] listen to this very
[47:57] closely he goes and the Lord said unto
[48:00] him what what is that in thy hand and he
[48:05] said a rod and he said cast it on the
[48:08] ground and he cast it on the ground and
[48:11] it became a
[48:13] serpent and Moses fled from before
[48:18] it and the Lord said to
[48:21] Moses put forth thy hand and take it by
[48:25] the
[48:25] tail and he put forth his hand and
[48:29] caught it and it became a rod in his
[48:32] hand let's go to Ephesians
[48:36] six we all know these these scriptures
[48:39] here many times we've
[48:41] heard including myself many times read
[48:45] this Ephesians
[48:47] 6 I believe this is very important to a
[48:51] believer of God and here in Ephesians
[48:54] 6:10 it says finally my brother
[48:57] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[49:00] of His might put on the whole armor of
[49:02] God that he may be able to stand against
[49:05] the Ws of the devil for when for we
[49:08] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[49:11] against principalities against Powers
[49:13] against all the rulers of the darkness
[49:15] of this world against spiritual
[49:17] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[49:20] unto you the whole armor of God that he
[49:23] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[49:27] and having done all stand to stand stand
[49:30] therefore having your loin girded about
[49:35] with truth having on the breastplate of
[49:39] righteousness and your feet Shaw with
[49:41] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[49:44] above all take taking the shield of
[49:47] Faith wherewith he shall be able to
[49:50] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[49:55] and take the helmet of
[49:57] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[50:00] which is the word of God Amen you may be
[50:07] seated I would like to take a little
[50:09] thought this evening just kind
[50:12] of what is what is in your hand little
[50:16] David all right what's in your hand
[50:19] little David what's in your
[50:21] hand brothers and
[50:24] sisters he preached this morning morning
[50:27] on the authorities of
[50:29] sons and if you believe that you're a
[50:32] son or a daughter of God and believe
[50:33] that God has given you
[50:36] Authority then there should be something
[50:38] on the inside of you that should know
[50:42] who you are right now all right because
[50:46] today we have complete word of God
[50:49] through a prophet of this age had come
[50:51] to you and I and gave you everything
[50:55] that you need
[50:57] to kill the devil right all right okay
[51:01] now we go back here and we see
[51:05] Moses and he
[51:08] still kept talking to God saying he
[51:11] couldn't do these things okay but then
[51:15] God come back one more time and if you
[51:18] drop down to the 12th 12 verse he said
[51:22] now therefore go and I will be with thy
[51:25] mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say
[51:30] okay all right so if you and I will just
[51:34] believe what the prophet of God said and
[51:38] read your Bible that is your staff this
[51:41] is your Rod this should be in your hand
[51:45] at all
[51:48] times physically I know you have to work
[51:52] but in the spiritual realm that's where
[51:54] the devil is going to come and attack
[51:56] back your mind to get you off
[52:00] track and so you have to be able to be
[52:03] able to withstand him by the word of God
[52:07] when Jesus was up there on that high
[52:09] mountain he only used the word he never
[52:13] use his power he used the word because
[52:16] the word was
[52:18] proven and if you and I can believe that
[52:21] the word is proven in your mind and drop
[52:24] that down into your heart brothers and
[52:27] sisters Every Chain will have to
[52:30] break so what's in your hand little
[52:34] David it can't be Mama's or Daddy's
[52:39] experience because you go back in the
[52:42] scriptures Moses when he was a little
[52:45] boy his mother knew that he was special
[52:48] yeah all right but that day that he was
[52:50] born the King was killing
[52:54] babies because they was supp to be a
[52:57] deliverer yeah this mother by the
[53:01] inspiration of the Lord inspired her to
[53:04] put this little baby in a basket and let
[53:07] it go down the river now God could have
[53:11] let that baby go down the river to a
[53:13] tribe somewhere and he was been able to
[53:16] be with a tribe they could have taught
[53:18] him how to fight and they could have
[53:20] went back there and F the Egyptians and
[53:22] and and being Victorious but that wasn't
[53:26] the deliver that God was going to use
[53:29] for Israel okay so he let this little
[53:32] baby go down the Nile to go into a place
[53:36] right underneath the enemy and the enemy
[53:39] fell in love with
[53:40] him because the daughter of pharaoh now
[53:44] has a son and the Pharaoh looked at him
[53:46] as a grandson says he will be the heir
[53:49] of my kingdom and so but the mama there
[53:53] gave him back to the real mama yeah he
[53:56] was had an experience with his real
[53:59] mother right he was able to feed off of
[54:02] her she loved him he even got taught
[54:05] about what the Hebrew was and she was
[54:09] telling him who he
[54:12] was but he had an experience of
[54:15] something his mother had all right she
[54:18] had an experience in a living God but he
[54:22] had an experience in what mama said and
[54:25] that ain't going to get you know where
[54:27] you have to have an experience with God
[54:29] Almighty yourself and when you have that
[54:32] experience with God he comes down inside
[54:35] of you and you're a miniature Gods right
[54:39] Hallelujah so 40 years he knew that he
[54:42] was a child of the Hebrews yeah yeah but
[54:46] here was a king a pharaoh that had
[54:50] brought him in and brewed over him and
[54:52] put him into the school and taught him
[54:54] how to be able to speak and do things
[54:57] and how to fight and everything else
[55:00] yeah for 40 years he knew how to go with
[55:03] a with a men and go fight and win
[55:08] battles he knew how to dress nice he
[55:11] knew how to eat right he knew how to
[55:13] speak right he knew everything about the
[55:17] Egyptians but there was something laid
[55:20] down inside of him that one day it might
[55:23] have been a cousin or might have been a
[55:25] friend that that Egyptian was beating on
[55:27] and something on the side of him rose up
[55:30] and he killed that e that
[55:33] Egyptian everything he learned right
[55:37] then was
[55:39] void because now he was a fugitive and
[55:42] Pharaoh was going to come and kill him
[55:44] and the Bible says that he fled to the
[55:49] Wilderness all the power he had was
[55:52] backed up with him if he would have
[55:53] stayed long enough to be
[55:56] payroll he could have been able to let
[55:59] them
[56:00] go and walk
[56:03] free sometimes we go through trials
[56:06] because we do not sit back long enough
[56:09] and let God deal with the situations we
[56:12] do it ourselves and we get ourselves in
[56:15] in hot water and before long we're
[56:17] running to the
[56:19] Wilderness yeah and when we do those
[56:21] things it takes us a lot longer to get
[56:23] around the mountain because we have to
[56:25] get to a place that we're dead Amen to
[56:28] Christ so that Christ can come and live
[56:31] inside of you and that life will motify
[56:35] you it will get you to a place as Jesus
[56:38] was not my will but thy will be done and
[56:42] that's where he's trying to get you and
[56:44] I to place where you and I can believe
[56:46] what brother random says without just
[56:48] saying lips but it comes in life when
[56:51] you walk out that door you will be
[56:54] exactly what you've been
[56:56] preach to all right because now the
[56:59] preaching comes in the manifestation
[57:01] through you all right hallelujah amen
[57:05] and so here he
[57:08] was now it's going to take God another
[57:12] 40 years to get all that trash out of
[57:15] him sometimes we're all sitting here but
[57:18] I've been in the message for 10 years
[57:19] and he's still working on me because of
[57:22] the things I used to do what is it those
[57:25] things have been rooted into you have
[57:27] been born into you of sin and it has to
[57:30] take a God to come in and root all them
[57:32] things
[57:33] out right you take some of these these
[57:38] uh bushes out here that we
[57:40] have yuckers and stuff oh they're easy
[57:43] to pop out of the ground they're
[57:45] dead but when you get a these trees that
[57:48] we got to have Elm trees you can cut
[57:51] them things right out the ground two
[57:54] weeks later new stuff starts growing up
[57:57] you can go in there and chop it off take
[58:01] the big old stump out but you let that
[58:04] roote going down there and one down the
[58:06] road this little stump starts bringing
[58:08] out all right all right it's going to
[58:10] take God Almighty by the prayers of the
[58:13] Saints getting down into their knees and
[58:15] asking God to root out all evil root out
[58:18] everything of unbelief everything out of
[58:21] us so that we will know what's in our
[58:24] hand right
[58:26] sometimes we wonder what can I do yeah
[58:31] what can I do
[58:35] brother Moses was probably standing
[58:37] there but I can't I can't talk like them
[58:39] any I I stutter I'm just a sheep
[58:45] her but there's a time and a place that
[58:48] God's getting us to and when he gets us
[58:52] there you're more than conquerors amen
[58:56] it says you're more than conquerors in
[58:58] Christ Jesus so what are
[59:02] you Sons and Daughters of God brother
[59:06] brand brother wend was saying this
[59:09] morning that sometimes we look in the
[59:11] mirror and we see these things that
[59:13] we're doing and we just feel so bad in
[59:15] things but the prophet of God is taking
[59:17] scripture and he comes back and he says
[59:21] if you repent and the blood is shed upon
[59:24] you red over red is white and when God
[59:28] looks at you you're
[59:30] perfect and so if you want God to look
[59:32] at you perfect get under the
[59:36] blood and if we're under the blood you
[59:39] have the authority and if you have
[59:41] authority absolutely the devil don't
[59:44] have nothing about you now you could do
[59:46] whatever you want in the name of the
[59:48] Lord Jesus and he'll have to do it
[59:50] because he's bound to that name all
[59:53] right because that's a name above all
[59:54] names
[59:56] and he was trying to get
[59:59] Moses to
[1:00:02] believe and so what did he do after he
[1:00:05] picked up that Rod it was in his hands
[1:00:07] but then he looks right at him and says
[1:00:09] now
[1:00:10] Moses put your
[1:00:13] hand in your coat and he puts it in
[1:00:15] there and he brings it out and it's
[1:00:17] leprosy and he sticks it back in he goes
[1:00:19] put it back in he puts it back and it
[1:00:21] came back to
[1:00:23] flesh God showed him signs and he says
[1:00:26] the first sign that they don't believe
[1:00:28] I'll give them the next sign
[1:00:31] yeah all
[1:00:33] right God knows how to wear people out
[1:00:37] he knows how to defeat the Devil if he
[1:00:41] can just get our minds completely out of
[1:00:43] the way and let him have the
[1:00:47] heart goes back you're more than a
[1:00:50] conqueror all right but what's in your
[1:00:53] hand little David
[1:00:56] what's in your
[1:00:57] hand Moses had to have an experience
[1:01:01] with
[1:01:02] God so that he can have the faith to be
[1:01:05] an overcomer okay and God was giving him
[1:01:09] a
[1:01:11] backside
[1:01:13] experience in a burning bush because
[1:01:16] when he looked up at there one day and
[1:01:18] he saw that burning bush there was
[1:01:20] something about that that was pulling
[1:01:22] upon him he had to know and if you
[1:01:24] stepped on those grounds you would die
[1:01:27] he had to be something
[1:01:29] special am if there's a call in you to
[1:01:33] come up a little higher it's because
[1:01:36] God's calling you not Satan Satan only
[1:01:39] wants you to get onto the word so you
[1:01:41] can be judged but a child of God has
[1:01:44] been judged on Calvary you just have to
[1:01:47] believe and when you believe it takes
[1:01:49] you underneath that blood that you have
[1:01:52] been atoned by by the presence of God
[1:01:55] coming into your life then you become
[1:01:58] Sons and Daughters before the
[1:02:00] foundations of the world not when you
[1:02:03] recognize that you was a sinner here you
[1:02:05] recognize that you are already a son and
[1:02:07] daughter of
[1:02:09] God but he gives you the ear of the Holy
[1:02:13] Ghost to come and live in you just like
[1:02:17] he lived in that flesh called Jesus
[1:02:20] Christ amen you'll be able to stand
[1:02:23] there with your foot on the bow and say
[1:02:25] peace be
[1:02:26] still you can change the circumstances
[1:02:29] when you when you are filled with the
[1:02:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:02:33] reading your Bible every day and you're
[1:02:35] not letting the devil come in there and
[1:02:36] mess you up but you're saying get behind
[1:02:40] me we need to quit playing childish
[1:02:43] games with the devil yeah we are so far
[1:02:46] away from this thing when parents and
[1:02:50] children are arguing all the time
[1:02:52] there's a lack of the holy spirit in
[1:02:54] their lives when me and my wife get too
[1:02:57] much fussy fussy it's because we're not
[1:02:59] reading that Bible like we should be
[1:03:01] we're not getting into that message and
[1:03:02] getting tenderized and getting the love
[1:03:05] of God living inside of us we forget who
[1:03:07] we are sometimes we forget who your wife
[1:03:10] is you forget about who your children
[1:03:11] are you forget about what Mom and Daddy
[1:03:13] is that is a god living inside of that
[1:03:16] flesh and we need to have respect for
[1:03:19] one another that's why all through the
[1:03:21] Bible it says love your brother love
[1:03:24] your sister love these things why
[1:03:27] because you got something in your hand
[1:03:29] that's most powerful thing in the world
[1:03:31] and that's the word of
[1:03:33] God that's what's going to conquer this
[1:03:35] world this is what's going to conquer
[1:03:37] every devil that's in your way and when
[1:03:41] Moses
[1:03:42] realized that he was a oneman
[1:03:45] army Hallelujah he come down off of that
[1:03:48] mountain and when he came down off of
[1:03:49] that mountain he got his donkey he put
[1:03:53] his little wife upon there and he put
[1:03:55] his two B on our hips and said we're
[1:03:57] going to go down and tell Egyptians to
[1:03:59] let my people go all
[1:04:02] right he went to his father-in-law and
[1:04:04] he said Daddy I'm sorry but you got to
[1:04:06] take care of your own
[1:04:07] sheep God gave me two-legged sheep and
[1:04:12] I've got to go deliver
[1:04:14] them okay all right good God has placed
[1:04:18] it into your life to be a little Moses a
[1:04:22] little David and it's time for you to go
[1:04:24] down to Egypt
[1:04:26] and
[1:04:27] let all right these Devils know that
[1:04:31] they can't keep you bound no more right
[1:04:34] okay all right and so here he is how
[1:04:38] little how
[1:04:40] significant what is in your hand
[1:04:43] today you may not have even a stick in
[1:04:47] your
[1:04:48] hand you can testify you can
[1:04:51] sing or you can pass out tracks
[1:04:56] you can tell somebody about it
[1:04:59] whatsoever is in your hand yeah get out
[1:05:03] and do something about it
[1:05:06] move let's get going let's get the
[1:05:10] Revival moving let's fill these seats up
[1:05:16] get people saved filled with the Holy
[1:05:19] Ghost get the church built upon up
[1:05:24] around here
[1:05:26] on fire all right
[1:05:31] okay for the last three years I have
[1:05:34] known God has been speaking about being
[1:05:39] on fire for God being on on the the
[1:05:42] power side of God's word and will just
[1:05:45] sit there sometimes I'm guilty and just
[1:05:47] sit there like a mule at a gate knowing
[1:05:50] that that's what prophet of God said
[1:05:52] knowing that the gifts are there knowing
[1:05:55] that I'm a Child of God knowing these
[1:05:57] things but I'll sit there and look at
[1:05:59] the preacher like a mule at a
[1:06:02] gate you need to get on fire for God or
[1:06:05] you're going to be left
[1:06:07] here we can't be church members we can't
[1:06:10] be these things we've got to be Sons and
[1:06:13] Daughters of God we're further than a
[1:06:16] church building church we are God of a
[1:06:19] miniature gods that lives inside of you
[1:06:22] and I we've got to start acting like it
[1:06:25] well I can't do this cuz God told me not
[1:06:27] to do those things if that Spirit told
[1:06:30] you anything contrary to the word of God
[1:06:33] that's not
[1:06:34] God he's not going to let you do
[1:06:37] something and turn right around and say
[1:06:38] don't do that
[1:06:39] again all right cuz then he's changing
[1:06:41] his mind and he's not a changing
[1:06:44] God we've got to come back to the word
[1:06:47] of God where's your staff in your hand
[1:06:49] little little
[1:06:54] David all right Moses had to be cleaned
[1:06:56] out for 80 years and then he was in his
[1:06:59] time so that he can go do what he had to
[1:07:05] do he had a Crooked
[1:07:08] Stick how can an 80y old man go down
[1:07:11] there with an army that has been
[1:07:14] practicing for years how to use sword
[1:07:17] and to kill with Spears and horses and
[1:07:21] chariots and everything else and one
[1:07:24] word that come out of the mouth of
[1:07:26] pharaoh he would have been struck dead
[1:07:29] immediately okay because he knew he who
[1:07:32] he was because he got the sign the
[1:07:37] experience that he needed to be a
[1:07:40] deliverer praise the
[1:07:42] Lord Lord I'm sorry
[1:07:45] Church you're not going to be well until
[1:07:48] you learn to be a deliver over your own
[1:07:50] self
[1:07:56] right you got
[1:07:58] complexes you've got to stand up on
[1:08:01] God's word I like that quote that you
[1:08:03] put out this
[1:08:04] morning You've Got to Believe
[1:08:08] It When God says you're healed you walk
[1:08:11] out of there and you say I'm Healed and
[1:08:13] you keep saying it until you believe
[1:08:17] it it might take two weeks it might take
[1:08:20] a year but you keep telling everybody
[1:08:24] I'm Healed
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:27] don't worry about the circumstances but
[1:08:29] you stand on the word of
[1:08:32] God Jesus had to stand on the word of
[1:08:36] God the day before he got crucified he
[1:08:39] wanted to not go to
[1:08:43] Calvary his heart was
[1:08:46] heavy but he looks down in his hands and
[1:08:49] he sees your name written in his palms
[1:08:51] of his
[1:08:52] hands yeah not my will but thine will be
[1:08:57] done yes if you believe that God saved
[1:09:03] your soul yeah and you're obligated to
[1:09:07] come underneath that word that head chip
[1:09:10] and let God take control yes of you and
[1:09:15] if he's got control of
[1:09:17] you you ain't going to hunker down on
[1:09:21] the preacher you're not going to hunker
[1:09:23] down on anything
[1:09:26] because you already know who you
[1:09:31] are why would I want to be in the
[1:09:33] way of God doing something for the
[1:09:38] church get me out of the way Lord
[1:09:41] whatever it
[1:09:42] takes it just takes dying we don't like
[1:09:45] to
[1:09:47] die older we get we don't like to die we
[1:09:50] like to be set in our old ways
[1:09:55] we can quote unquote brother brand but
[1:09:59] sometimes our life ain't quoting up with
[1:10:00] the BR sometimes it's a two-sided mouth
[1:10:04] talking I believe this but I don't
[1:10:06] believe
[1:10:07] this I would be better off if I don't go
[1:10:10] this way I would rather say brother
[1:10:13] wendle help me to pray I got it on the
[1:10:16] Shelf I just don't understand then say
[1:10:20] well I don't believe it that
[1:10:24] way cuz there's things in that book I
[1:10:26] don't understand but I believe it all
[1:10:29] right because one day he said he'll
[1:10:31] reveal it to me he said he'll reveal it
[1:10:34] to me it's not time but what I do know
[1:10:37] I'm going to do my very
[1:10:39] best to conquer every devil cuz we are
[1:10:44] devil Slayers
[1:10:49] okay hallelujah praise the
[1:10:52] Lord don't make any difference God told
[1:10:56] me to take this stick and go down and
[1:10:59] take over God said so I'm going to do it
[1:11:03] why it seems like
[1:11:06] retical but he did it Hallelujah why God
[1:11:11] takes the radical to prove his power
[1:11:15] hallelujah amen what is he going to
[1:11:18] prove that you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:20] God they're going to call you crazy but
[1:11:23] that craziness is going to prove to them
[1:11:25] that you're Son of
[1:11:26] God who cares what they say about you
[1:11:30] well I don't know if I raise my hand in
[1:11:32] church man they're going to call me
[1:11:35] crazy you're crazy if you
[1:11:38] don't cuz the devil's got you he's got
[1:11:41] circumstances on you
[1:11:44] yeah you still got chains on you you
[1:11:47] don't want to stand up and shout a
[1:11:48] little bit cuz your knees might buckle
[1:11:50] down have faith stand up
[1:11:55] yes Peter and David I mean Peter and uh
[1:11:58] John when he went to go to pray in the
[1:12:00] synagogue there's a a beggar there
[1:12:02] begging for for money he walked up and
[1:12:04] said silver and gold I have none but
[1:12:06] what such I have I give to you and he
[1:12:08] Bible picks him up and holds him until
[1:12:10] he gets strengthen his legs and then he
[1:12:12] started praising God leaping and
[1:12:14] shouting and jumping going into the
[1:12:16] synagogue praising
[1:12:18] God I think some of us need to get that
[1:12:20] experience in our lives again get the
[1:12:22] fire built back up in our Liv that we
[1:12:24] can worship God in freeness instead of
[1:12:27] being under
[1:12:30] circumstances well my first church don't
[1:12:32] believe that well that church might be
[1:12:35] wrong let's go according to the
[1:12:41] scriptures David didn't even have the
[1:12:43] Holy Ghost but when the when the
[1:12:46] Covenant was coming in he took his
[1:12:48] clothes off and started worshiping God
[1:12:50] he didn't care what people say he was
[1:12:53] glad that it was coming back and into
[1:12:55] the
[1:12:58] kingdom yes who cares what his wife said
[1:13:02] he wasn't doing it to show his nakedness
[1:13:05] he showed that his reverence of God was
[1:13:08] coming back into the fold so he would
[1:13:12] have the supreme authority in the
[1:13:15] Kingdom not David's Kingdom but God's
[1:13:22] kingdom David was tired of seeing his
[1:13:24] people getting k killed he wanted peace
[1:13:27] if you want peace in your
[1:13:29] mind what's in your hand little David if
[1:13:33] it's empty you need to find this and get
[1:13:36] to busy start reading
[1:13:40] it yes Samson was just a a an ordinary
[1:13:45] man he wasn't all biffed up like the
[1:13:47] movies bring him
[1:13:49] up he's not he's not the Rock
[1:13:57] rock is a guy that buildt his muscles up
[1:14:00] and made him million millions of dollars
[1:14:03] because he's all big and goodlooking
[1:14:05] seeing Elvis
[1:14:07] Presley he's going to re be right beside
[1:14:09] Elvis Presley if he doesn't get his life
[1:14:11] right yeah but Samson was a little man
[1:14:16] God don't need big things he just needs
[1:14:18] a heart that he can do something
[1:14:23] with and the Phil Ines were coming and
[1:14:26] they he couldn't he wasn't a fighter but
[1:14:28] he looked down and he saw a bone of a
[1:14:33] donkey and he picked it up and the
[1:14:37] spirit of the Lord fell upon him and he
[1:14:39] slain a thousand
[1:14:43] Philistines it's impossible to do that
[1:14:46] by
[1:14:48] yourself but he did it because he
[1:14:51] believed in a God that could do it
[1:14:54] Hallelujah
[1:14:56] glory to
[1:14:57] God praise be to God what is
[1:15:01] it Hebrews 11
[1:15:04] and6 but without faith it's impossible
[1:15:06] to please him for he that cometh to God
[1:15:10] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:15:14] rewarder of them that go to the grocery
[1:15:16] store and buy
[1:15:20] groceries he will reward them because
[1:15:22] they're going to go do something good
[1:15:25] for the
[1:15:26] community
[1:15:29] no he says and that he is reward of them
[1:15:34] that diligent seek Him and when you seek
[1:15:38] him he's going to give you
[1:15:43] power what's in your hand little David
[1:15:46] what's in your
[1:15:48] hand well I don't know can you
[1:15:51] sing can you testify come on
[1:15:56] is there anybody in here that has never
[1:15:57] been saved
[1:16:01] yet if not let's get it done so you have
[1:16:04] a testimony you can tell somebody
[1:16:07] about so every one of you are sitting
[1:16:09] here that you have a testimony are you
[1:16:12] giving your testimony out every day are
[1:16:14] you seeing these little women you're
[1:16:15] seeing these men with faces drawing down
[1:16:17] to hair are you look at I'm and say hey
[1:16:20] I know how to make you
[1:16:22] happy that bottle that you're getting
[1:16:23] ready to go into ain't going going to
[1:16:25] make you happy it's going to give you a
[1:16:26] headache
[1:16:27] tomorrow but I know a Jesus that's lit
[1:16:31] me on fire took that same desire that
[1:16:34] you had out and placed himself in me and
[1:16:37] today I got joy unspeakable and full of
[1:16:40] Glory I don't have to live under a box
[1:16:43] no more I live in the Kingdom of
[1:16:46] Heaven because I have created a mountain
[1:16:49] I created an atmosphere that I am living
[1:16:52] in Hallelujah why because there's
[1:16:54] something down deep inside of me that's
[1:16:58] pulling because it's getting me on
[1:17:03] fire I was at brother Dale's on a
[1:17:07] Wednesday
[1:17:08] night and he does he has about aund and
[1:17:10] some people that come to his church on
[1:17:13] Sundays a lot of them live far away this
[1:17:16] one
[1:17:17] family only lives four or five blocks
[1:17:21] away never comes on Wednesdays but they
[1:17:24] showed up on Wednesday that night and
[1:17:26] I'm
[1:17:29] preaching and I have these same glasses
[1:17:31] on I can't see you guys with these
[1:17:33] glasses these are all fuzzy like how it
[1:17:35] is right now got to have this for my my
[1:17:38] regular glasses are falling apart on
[1:17:42] me so I'm just preaching and all of a
[1:17:44] sudden these glasses just opened
[1:17:47] up and I can see those two and he's just
[1:17:51] standing there sitting there and she's
[1:17:53] just tears running down on her face I
[1:17:56] didn't know their problems D didn't tell
[1:17:58] me
[1:17:59] nothing I said the reason why you have a
[1:18:03] face that you have is because you don't
[1:18:05] enjoy coming to church I said when you
[1:18:08] feel that there's something wrong in
[1:18:10] your experience with God you need to
[1:18:13] come to God and be in church and let God
[1:18:16] give his love to you he perked up and
[1:18:20] from that point on he just kept his eyes
[1:18:21] right on me and I kept preaching kept
[1:18:23] preaching kept preaching
[1:18:26] brother
[1:18:27] Dale said that he text him that evening
[1:18:31] while we were sitting in the gr at the
[1:18:33] place to eat and he said brother William
[1:18:35] that brother told me that he said you
[1:18:38] lit a fire underneath him all right 3
[1:18:42] days later my sister text me and Sharon
[1:18:45] together and says there was a couple in
[1:18:47] our church that never comes on Wednesday
[1:18:50] nights they came Wednesday night when
[1:18:52] you came they said that they're never
[1:18:54] going to miss a church service
[1:18:58] again because that guy had to have an
[1:19:02] experience and when he got that
[1:19:04] experience something
[1:19:05] changed and when I went back and
[1:19:07] preached on a Wednesday night when there
[1:19:09] hardly anybody
[1:19:11] there he was standing back there with
[1:19:13] the biggest smile upon his face you
[1:19:15] could see the chain taken off of it and
[1:19:18] he was sitting there worshiping God
[1:19:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:19:22] and forever
[1:19:25] signs will follow them that believe I
[1:19:28] saw lots of signs following that man
[1:19:31] because he gave up and let God take over
[1:19:34] his life amen hallelujah don't be bound
[1:19:37] to the circumstances
[1:19:38] Church Moses was bound to circumstances
[1:19:42] until God showed him who he
[1:19:45] was Saul was bound to circumstances
[1:19:48] because he let
[1:19:51] L do something to him and he lost his
[1:19:54] hair his his power but one day when he
[1:19:58] got his power back he wanted to get out
[1:20:00] of that circumstances he said One More
[1:20:03] Time Lord one once more once more Lord
[1:20:08] and that day he killed more Philistines
[1:20:10] than he did in his whole life he gave
[1:20:12] his
[1:20:13] life to do what he was born and that was
[1:20:17] to kill
[1:20:19] Philistines
[1:20:22] Hallelujah diligently means
[1:20:25] doing something thoroughly and well with
[1:20:29] great
[1:20:30] care that's what diligent
[1:20:33] means we got to take these scriptures
[1:20:36] and really find a meaning of what it
[1:20:43] means
[1:20:44] David it was a little boy sitting out
[1:20:47] there in the taking care of his daddy's
[1:20:52] sheep every day he's taking care of his
[1:20:54] sheep and one day a a bear comes and he
[1:20:58] he what a great shepherd He
[1:21:01] was grabs one of his sheep and he leaves
[1:21:05] the 99 he goes get that one little sheep
[1:21:09] and he kills that bear with a
[1:21:13] slingshot and then another day here
[1:21:15] comes a
[1:21:16] lion he takes off with a a sheep he
[1:21:20] leaves a 99 and he goes and gets that
[1:21:22] sheep back and kills that lion
[1:21:25] all right now in this country where the
[1:21:30] where his brothers were fighting for the
[1:21:33] King
[1:21:34] Saul Jesse tells him say son take this
[1:21:37] bread take this this this this cheese

[1:25:51] champion this world needed Jesus
[1:25:55] we were Bound in the circumstances of
[1:25:58] sin and God had to come down through his

[1:26:30] come on little
[1:26:33] Boer and David starts swinging that that
[1:26:36] sling and about about the time that man
[1:26:39] starts getting up he lets it go
[1:26:43] yeah one spot that he did not put
[1:26:47] something there oh
[1:26:49] yeah Rock of Ages slammed him right
[1:26:51] there in the
[1:26:53] head Glory he falls down and David
[1:26:58] didn't have a
[1:26:59] knife but he went over to the
[1:27:02] enemy and he used the enemy's knife to
[1:27:06] cut himself cut the devil's head off not
[1:27:10] himself cut the devil's head right
[1:27:14] off Israel started screaming that
[1:27:18] something in the congregation the fire
[1:27:20] started building up and they came
[1:27:23] running out with their Spears in their
[1:27:25] hand and they
[1:27:27] said let's go and they went out and they
[1:27:30] killed those Philistines that
[1:27:32] day and he come back with proof that he
[1:27:36] was the anointed
[1:27:39] one and he brought that head and he
[1:27:42] threw it in front of
[1:27:44] Saul he said this
[1:27:46] day God won the battle
[1:27:56] so now
[1:27:58] David Little David what you got in your
[1:28:03] hand well I'm not a preacher but William
[1:28:06] but you are a singer sing with all thy
[1:28:12] Hearts I can't preach brother William
[1:28:15] that's all right brother Mike tell your
[1:28:19] testimony
[1:28:22] buddy every time you tell your t
[1:28:24] testimony the devil
[1:28:26] goes why because it is experience
[1:28:30] between you and God and he can't take
[1:28:33] that
[1:28:37] away so what's in your hand little David
[1:28:41] I pray to God that it's this and if it's
[1:28:43] in your hand then you're going to
[1:28:46] believe and you'll get that fire built
[1:28:49] up in you don't matter how old you are
[1:28:56] because when they crossed that Red Sea
[1:28:59] it was an 80 something year old woman or
[1:29:01] 90 year old woman that was running down
[1:29:03] with a tambourine in her hand she had
[1:29:06] Victory all right the chains were broken
[1:29:10] and the devil was in the
[1:29:13] sea you're Slayers
[1:29:16] tonight you're a Mighty Men of
[1:29:20] valer don't let nobody in this message
[1:29:23] say that you're not a soldier of God you
[1:29:25] are a soldier of
[1:29:27] God you're going to have Battle Scars
[1:29:30] but those Battle Scars are going to
[1:29:32] bring a fire underneath you knowing that
[1:29:34] he was with you in every battle amen
[1:29:39] amen that's why David could stand there
[1:29:41] and say I can kill that Philistine
[1:29:43] because he had an experience with that
[1:29:45] slingshot and he know he was good at
[1:29:48] it cuz he trusted in that God would make
[1:29:51] sure that that rock would hit him right
[1:29:53] where it need needed to be so he can cut
[1:29:55] his head
[1:29:58] off praise be to God goath made his
[1:30:04] boast when that fell in David's ear it
[1:30:09] killed
[1:30:11] him because it took the right man for
[1:30:14] the right job and those there at the
[1:30:17] Baptist Church ain't the right people
[1:30:19] it's those that have came to Malachi 4
[1:30:24] that turned the hearts of the people
[1:30:27] back to the original Faith at
[1:30:33] Pentecost and you're going to have the
[1:30:35] same signs that they had you don't have
[1:30:38] to boast you can walk up to somebody say
[1:30:41] silver and gold I have none and grab
[1:30:44] them by the hand and say get up and walk
[1:30:46] in the name of Jesus and if you have
[1:30:49] thus sayith the Lord in your life it
[1:30:52] didn't say that this person has to have
[1:30:54] faith brother Brown says they you can
[1:30:56] sit down he didn't ask them if he had
[1:30:59] faith in Jesus or
[1:31:01] God he didn't ask him if he was a
[1:31:04] Believer right he just said I don't have
[1:31:07] silver and gold but what I have I give
[1:31:10] unto thee and he grabbed a h of him and
[1:31:14] brought him up in the name of Jesus and
[1:31:16] he got his strength in his
[1:31:21] legs Peter isn't no no better than you
[1:31:24] are he's just a Son of God but he knew
[1:31:28] who his maker was do you all
[1:31:36] right we've got to come to the complete
[1:31:39] word that word has to be completed in
[1:31:43] you I know we're all on different steps
[1:31:46] but we should be striving to get at the
[1:31:48] top we should be striving to step down
[1:31:51] one and grab somebody else and help them
[1:31:53] up yeah amen you can't leave all the
[1:31:57] load on him you can't leave all the load
[1:32:00] on these other
[1:32:01] preachers you've got to eat the book
[1:32:04] yourself and I think sometimes I wonder
[1:32:07] if we're eating the book like we're
[1:32:09] saying we got brother brandham quotes
[1:32:13] just for ourselves but we got to take
[1:32:15] all the
[1:32:17] quotes that's why we got marriage and
[1:32:19] divorce all fouled up because they only
[1:32:21] take the marriage and divorce tape
[1:32:22] that's it
[1:32:24] but you got to go all the way back when
[1:32:26] he first started talking he never
[1:32:28] changed his
[1:32:30] mind she can't he can only under
[1:32:34] fornication bottom line but we got
[1:32:37] people in this message who preaching
[1:32:39] that's been married two or three
[1:32:41] times they're messed up in this
[1:32:48] church don't be deceived Church stick
[1:32:52] with the word
[1:32:54] brother Adam never came off of this
[1:32:57] right
[1:32:57] here Jesus said it wasn't so at the
[1:33:00] beginning so if it wasn't so at the
[1:33:02] beginning it's not so now cuz he's an
[1:33:05] unchanging
[1:33:06] God and so when he said I died for you
[1:33:11] you can take that to the bank and sign
[1:33:13] it and cash it in you're sick this
[1:33:16] morning cash it in you'll be healed in
[1:33:19] the name of Jesus Hallelujah why what's
[1:33:23] in in your hand little
[1:33:27] David not
[1:33:30] circumstances but it has to be
[1:33:34] Faith thy
[1:33:36] sword in thy hand this is the
[1:33:41] rod this rod in you can conquer every
[1:33:44] devil praise the Lord in your life
[1:33:49] this can
[1:33:51] conquer sickness
[1:33:57] cancer

[1:34:16] him this will let you love your brother
[1:34:19] if because he's an oddball you still
[1:34:20] love
[1:34:22] him we've got so many things in our
[1:34:28] life that we want to condemn everybody
[1:34:31] except
[1:34:34] ourselves and we got sin in our own life
[1:34:37] what's in your hand little David David
[1:34:40] didn't have sin in his life that's why
[1:34:42] he was Victorious but when he did have
[1:34:44] sin in his life God corrected him and he
[1:34:47] repented that shows he had character of
[1:34:50] God in him
[1:34:55] Moses fouled up he didn't get to Cross
[1:34:58] Jordan he got to see
[1:35:00] it but God had take
[1:35:03] him
[1:35:05] right we got to come to a place in our
[1:35:07] life that Jesus Christ is everything to
[1:35:09] us prise the
[1:35:12] Lord because I'm can tell you something
[1:35:14] you go get a extension cord and stick

[1:37:23] eternal eternal life where unto thou are
[1:37:26] also called and hath professed a good
[1:37:31] profession
[1:37:32] before many
[1:37:36] witnesses samgar I'm almost done here's
[1:37:40] little B in the Bible little
[1:37:43] Shamar a little farmer just a a man that
[1:37:46] just every year would get this crop and
[1:37:49] he'd get his crop in and about that time
[1:37:51] 600 Philistines would come big old fat
[1:37:54] things and take off with his
[1:37:57] food year after year brother B call him
[1:38:01] fat go look it
[1:38:03] up all
[1:38:06] right so one
[1:38:08] year he gets it all stored up and he
[1:38:11] gets it all ready and he's in the house
[1:38:14] yeah and he's hearing these Footprints
[1:38:19] foots and his little girl looks out the
[1:38:21] window says Oh Daddy we're not going to
[1:38:23] have food this year this
[1:38:26] winter he looks over and his wife is in
[1:38:28] tears
[1:38:29] crying in agony knowing that they're
[1:38:32] going to be starving all winter long the
[1:38:35] hard work my husband did now they're
[1:38:38] coming but something Rose in him
[1:38:42] something at that moment he caught a
[1:38:46] glimpse of what God did for him he
[1:38:50] realized that he was
[1:38:52] circumcised he knew knew that he was a
[1:38:56] Israelite he says I'm not a fighter I
[1:38:58] don't have time to go fight and and
[1:39:01] learn how to
[1:39:04] fight so he did the very best thing he
[1:39:07] could is believing God will take the
[1:39:11] devil and he goes and he gets the ox I
[1:39:14] can't even say the word b b a r b o b a
[1:39:19] o
[1:39:20] d yes and that's a a stick that they
[1:39:23] used to pry cows through and beat off
[1:39:26] the stuff off all the equipment and
[1:39:29] stuff very heavy big old nut on the back
[1:39:32] of it he grabs a hold of it and brother
[1:39:36] Brown says he gets
[1:39:39] angry he ain't angry of God he ain't
[1:39:42] angry of his people but he's angry of
[1:39:45] the devil coming in and stealing his his
[1:39:47] his treasure his stuff that would feed
[1:39:50] his children and feed his wife and make
[1:39:52] a little living
[1:39:54] yeah and the Bible says he went out and
[1:39:57] he killed 600 Philistines that
[1:40:02] day because
[1:40:05] God come on the scene and anointed
[1:40:08] him to kill his
[1:40:12] enemy if God could do that in the Old
[1:40:15] Testament he'll do it today in the
[1:40:18] spiritual realm you are down with
[1:40:21] circumstances chained down it's time to
[1:40:24] grab the ox and start
[1:40:29] fighting you don't have to come up here
[1:40:32] and let brother wend fight for you he's
[1:40:35] preached and he's preached what you need
[1:40:38] grab a hold of it and believe put it in
[1:40:40] your hands and
[1:40:42] fight
[1:40:43] fight with all that's in you and believe
[1:40:47] that the enemy will be smoting
[1:40:54] amen
[1:40:56] hallelujah don't let the devil come over
[1:40:59] and take the glory of God out of the
[1:41:02] church he's already did it to the church
[1:41:05] ages but today he's restored that Joy
[1:41:09] let's get it back into our hearts don't
[1:41:12] let it just be preached and let words
[1:41:14] just fly out grab a hold of them put
[1:41:18] them into your
[1:41:20] bosom and let it go to the heart and let
[1:41:23] God come down and take over and watch
[1:41:27] the power of God come through and you
[1:41:31] will be another acts in the
[1:41:36] Bible because I believe the prophet of
[1:41:40] God said that we are more than
[1:41:43] conquerors because he saw it in the
[1:41:46] scriptures and he wanted to make sure
[1:41:47] that you and I knew that that means you
[1:41:53] that's why he kept repeating
[1:41:55] it that's why he kept repeating these
[1:41:58] things because he wanted to make sure
[1:42:00] that you knew who you
[1:42:04] are praise be to God what's in your
[1:42:08] hand he just had an
[1:42:10] ox and what
[1:42:12] happened 600 Philistines laid on the
[1:42:15] ground dead and he was able to eat that
[1:42:18] winter and his little girl got fat and
[1:42:21] sassy and those
[1:42:25] Philistines rotted up and went to
[1:42:27] nothing all right it's time to put the
[1:42:30] devil in his place it's time to take
[1:42:34] your joy back it's time to take your
[1:42:37] salvation your presence of the Lord in
[1:42:40] your life take
[1:42:42] it and make him suffer for it by cutting
[1:42:46] his head off and let him bleed
[1:42:48] out kill that
[1:42:50] devil you've got mind battles you need
[1:42:53] to kill that devil so he can't come back
[1:42:56] you kill that devil and that other devil
[1:42:58] over there he's crying back he won't
[1:43:00] even want to come to he'll go into some
[1:43:02] swine
[1:43:03] somewhere why is those pigs smarter than
[1:43:09] us when Jesus went to that man and he
[1:43:13] cursed them
[1:43:14] Devils they went into those swines and
[1:43:17] them swines had more more intelligence
[1:43:20] than we do and ran off the cliff and
[1:43:22] died cuz they didn't want those
[1:43:25] Devils but we'll sit there and take them
[1:43:28] all day long Oh Me Oh Me yeah oh Oh
[1:43:34] Me Oh I got heart problems
[1:43:38] no I'm Healed in the name of Jesus cut
[1:43:42] that devil's head
[1:43:44] off Mark 16 I couldn't stop without
[1:43:49] reading
[1:43:50] this Mark 16 And1 17 and these signs
[1:43:54] shall follow them that believe in my

[1:58:05] in the camp when the word is being
[1:58:08] preached our homes we we we operate
[1:58:13] that through our relationship with the
[1:58:16] Lord so relationship is not coming to
[1:58:20] church that has nothing to do with
[1:58:22] relationship that's right amen that's we
[1:58:25] learn we we worship him we give that
[1:58:29] honor to him we learn from him but
