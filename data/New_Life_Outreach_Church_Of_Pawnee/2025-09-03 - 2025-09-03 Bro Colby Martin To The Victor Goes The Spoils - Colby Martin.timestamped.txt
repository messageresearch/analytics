[35:31] [Music]

[36:52] needed.
[36:56] You're all I want.

[38:14] Lord, help me find a way
[38:18] to bring me back to you.
[38:25] You're all I want.
[38:33] You're all I've ever
[38:38] needed.
[38:39] [Music]
[38:41] You're all I want.
[38:48] Help me know you are near.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Sing that again.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; You're
[39:00] good job.
[39:02] [Music]
[39:10] [Applause]
[39:11] [Music]
[39:23] Sing that again. You're all I want.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; You're all I want.
[39:30] [Music]
[39:35] You're all I
[39:38] ever needed.
[39:40] [Music]
[39:42] &gt;&gt; You're all I want.
[39:46] [Music]
[39:47] [Applause]
[39:50] Help me know you are near.
[39:56] [Music]
[39:59] Greater is he that is in me.
[40:04] Greater is he that is in me.
[40:09] Greater is he that is in me
[40:13] than he that is in the world.
[40:17] Oh Sat's life a roaring line
[40:23] rolling to and fro
[40:27] seeking who he may.
[40:32] The Bible tells us so.
[40:36] And many souls have been its prey to
[40:41] fall at some weak hour.
[40:45] But God has promised us today. His
[40:50] overcoming
[40:52] power. Oh now greater is he.
[40:58] God is greater.
[41:01] My God is greater
[41:04] that is in me than he that is in me. On
[41:09] the day of Pentecost and on the day of
[41:14] Pentecost,
[41:16] a rushing mighty wind.
[41:20] It blew into the upper room and baptized
[41:26] all of them. Oh, now with the power
[41:31] gater than
[41:34] any earthly foe.
[41:37] And I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm
[41:42] going to let the whole world know. Oh,
[41:45] God is greater.
[41:50] So much greater.
[41:53] Oh, he's gater.
[41:57] that is in me than he that is in without
[42:01] music now sing it. Oh now gater is he
[42:05] that is in me.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Greater is he. Do you believe it
[42:10] tonight? Oh gater is he that is in me
[42:16] than he that once again now. Oh
[42:21] gater.
[42:22] [Music]
[42:24] Oh gater.
[42:27] He's greater. Oh greater is he that is
[42:32] in me
[42:34] than he that is in the world.
[42:40] Oh my. Do you believe that tonight?
[42:43] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Greater
[42:45] is he. Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, if you have your
[42:48] Bibles, like to turn to Revelations 1
[42:52] and 18.
[42:54] It is good to see Brother Robert and
[42:56] Sister Brianna back with us here
[42:58] tonight.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Definitely had y'all in our
[43:01] thoughts and prayers and um enjoyed
[43:04] Annalina's song as well. And
[43:06] &gt;&gt; honestly, I am surprised to see Grandma
[43:08] here tonight, but it's good to see you.
[43:10] We definitely had you in our prayers. Um
[43:13] so, I'm glad everything went well. Amen.
[43:15] Do you love him here tonight?
[43:18] Amen.
[43:20] Now, I don't know how Brother Josh got
[43:21] out of preaching tonight. You know,
[43:23] usually when he's here, he needs to be
[43:25] preaching, but you guys got to hear me
[43:27] tonight. So, I pray we can say something
[43:29] that would be a help. But Revelations 1
[43:31] and and 18 says, "I am he that liveth
[43:34] and was dead, and behold, I am alive
[43:37] forever more." Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; And have the keys of hell and of death.
[43:43] Gracious heavenly father, how we love
[43:45] you here tonight. And it's it's it's an
[43:48] honor to be here, Lord, and appreciate
[43:50] the your presence that we felt and the
[43:53] the songs of praise and worship that has
[43:55] come out from your people tonight. I
[43:57] pray, Lord, that you'll bless each one
[43:59] of them. Bless the word here tonight.
[44:01] Father, may there be something that will
[44:04] be said that will be a help and a
[44:07] benefit to each one of them here
[44:08] tonight. We love you, Lord. In your
[44:11] precious name, we pray. Amen. You may be
[44:14] seated here tonight. And if I had a
[44:17] a a simple title, I you know, I'm used
[44:21] to speaking to the youth on Tuesday
[44:23] night. So tonight, it's going to be
[44:24] simple. So you can just turn to your
[44:26] neighbor and say, "I don't care how old
[44:28] you are. You're youth tonight. You're
[44:30] all youth." So we're going to keep it
[44:32] simple. Amen. Yeah. Brother Torrance is
[44:34] is youth tonight. Amen. But if I had a
[44:37] simple title, it would be to the victor
[44:41] goes the spoils. And we see I seen this
[44:45] here. It says to the victory goes the
[44:46] spoils is a proverb. Meaning the winner
[44:49] of a conflict, a competition or a
[44:53] struggle is entitled to the rewards and
[44:57] prizes or benefits that come with that
[45:00] victory. And we see here in our
[45:02] scripture reading, he says that I am he
[45:04] that liveth and was dead and behold, I
[45:06] am alive forever more and have the keys
[45:10] of death and hell. And and I want to
[45:13] declare here tonight that Jesus is our
[45:16] victorious king.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; We're not serving a a dead God, but we
[45:21] have a God that has risen from the dead
[45:24] &gt;&gt; and has power and dominion over every
[45:27] enemy that we have here tonight. But
[45:29] when he rose from the grave, he didn't
[45:30] come out empty-handed. He came out with
[45:33] something that declared his power over
[45:36] darkness. He took the keys of death and
[45:39] hell and the grave to show that he has
[45:42] the power. And Satan no longer has
[45:45] dominion over humanity. But God has
[45:48] dominion. God has power. Satan has no
[45:52] control over you anymore.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he did it for you and I
[45:56] that we may walk in a newness of life
[46:00] and that we may share his victory.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; That we can stand up and boldly declare
[46:05] that death where is thy sting and grave
[46:09] where is thy victory?
[46:12] &gt;&gt; We can say that here tonight because the
[46:14] same power that raised Christ from the
[46:16] dead
[46:17] &gt;&gt; if it dwelled in you it will quicken
[46:19] &gt;&gt; your mortal bodies.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; And do you believe that you're part of
[46:23] Christ tonight?
[46:25] Do you believe that you're part of
[46:26] Christ tonight? Then you have the same
[46:28] authority that Christ has.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; So we can say this death where is thy
[46:34] sting and grave where is thy victory
[46:36] because we stand in confidence that we
[46:39] can overcome it as well.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Now when I say to the victor goes the
[46:44] spoils I I want you to imagine
[46:47] a a boxer fighting in the championship
[46:50] round. dead.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; They say that a championship round goes
[46:55] for 12 rounds. And and how you win is
[46:58] either achieve a a knockout, which is a
[47:01] KO, or a technical knockout, which is a
[47:04] TKO, or by points scored by the judges.
[47:09] And we see at the end of it all, whether
[47:11] it was a KO or or a TKO or he made it
[47:14] all the way to to the 12 rounds and the
[47:17] judges by score declare that he's the
[47:19] champion, the champion is now standing
[47:21] in the middle of the ring hoisting a
[47:24] belt,
[47:25] &gt;&gt; showing that he just defeated his
[47:28] opponent
[47:29] &gt;&gt; and the announcer hands hands him the
[47:31] the championship belt. It is proof of
[47:34] his victory. Now he gets the spoils of
[47:37] that victory. He gets the belt. He gets
[47:39] the money. He gets the prestige. He gets
[47:41] the recognition that he is a champion
[47:44] boxer.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; No one can ever take that from him. He
[47:48] is a champion. And let me say this here
[47:51] tonight that Jesus didn't defeat his
[47:54] opponent in in a stadium with
[47:55] spotlights. But he defeated the greatest
[47:58] foe that was ever out through sin and
[48:00] death on the cross of Calvary in a tomb
[48:04] that could not hold him. Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Then he stepped into the throne of
[48:08] heaven, belted hand, saying, "All power
[48:11] is given unto me in heaven and in
[48:13] earth."
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Brother Brenham says
[48:17] here, "He went through the valley of the
[48:19] shadow of death and caught every dart of
[48:21] the devil
[48:22] &gt;&gt; and pulled it into his bosom and called
[48:25] for the church to take what you've got
[48:28] and do the best that you can." Praise
[48:30] God. He says, "On the day of Pentecost,
[48:33] a rushing mighty wind fell out of the
[48:35] heavens above and armed every man."
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; And every woman, every boy, I'm adding
[48:41] that there. And every girl with a
[48:43] weapon. And he says, "I'll say today, my
[48:46] brethren, that every man, whatever you
[48:48] got, let's do the best we can with it.
[48:52] Fight to the last man because we've got
[48:55] the enemy's lines broke." He says Christ
[48:58] defeated Satan, stripped him of
[49:00] everything he ever had. He is nothing
[49:03] but a bluff. When he tells you we cannot
[49:06] have another old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[49:09] outpouring of the spirit, we can have it
[49:12] today because the lines of the enemy has
[49:15] been broken and God rules and reigns
[49:19] today.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; We are fighting a defeated foe.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Say that with me. We are defing a
[49:27] defeated foe.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Then how in the world are we cowarding
[49:32] down to a defeated foe here tonight? I
[49:35] don't care what you're facing.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; It may look like the obstacle is the
[49:39] biggest thing you've ever seen in your
[49:41] life. Remember this. You are fighting a
[49:44] defeated foe here tonight. And if God
[49:47] had the power to overcome the enemy, you
[49:49] have the same power.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; You have the same authority.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see the the spoils the
[49:56] the reward of Jesus's victory was not
[50:00] just for himself. Now in ancient times a
[50:03] king would conquer another kingdom and
[50:06] receive their land's treasure and their
[50:08] prisoners and of war all their wealth.
[50:11] So we see when Jesus conquered the
[50:13] dominion of darkness, he ransomed the
[50:16] lost souls.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; He took everybody that was in the grip
[50:20] of Satan and he ransomed them unto
[50:22] himself.
[50:24] and he took the keys.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; What jail cell are you in here tonight?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus has the keys.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Satan no longer can keep you there
[50:35] because Christ has the keys.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; That's why you and I can walk in victory
[50:44] because the King of Kings has the keys
[50:47] here tonight.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; There's no jail cell. There's no prison
[50:50] bars that can keep you. You're free here
[50:53] tonight. Satan wants to keep you bound
[50:56] with the fake bars.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. And if we don't realize
[51:00] what Christ has done for us, we will
[51:03] stay behind those fake bars.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; We'll be like Johnny Crow having our
[51:08] bonds cut. But we've been so used to
[51:10] being in that condition year after year,
[51:13] month after month, day after day that
[51:16] we're staying there of our own accord.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; The bonds have been cut. Come on.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; The rope has been cut. You're free to
[51:23] walk out. The door to your jail cell is
[51:26] open. It's no longer shut. You're no
[51:29] longer bound. You're free.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; The only way you can stay in captivity
[51:33] is by your own accord.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; If Satan can blind your eyes here
[51:38] tonight to make you think this is who
[51:41] you are, to make you think that you can
[51:43] never be to get over this addiction and
[51:45] make you think this is all you're ever
[51:47] going to be. You're going to stay in
[51:49] that condition. But if you can listen to
[51:51] Christ's voice that says, "He who the
[51:53] son sets free is free indeed." You can
[51:56] walk out of that jail cell.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay there.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Kobe, that's simple."
[52:03] &gt;&gt; But it's true.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; We need to realize that Jesus' victory
[52:11] has now become our victory. Yes.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; When we fail to see the victory that
[52:17] Christ had for us,
[52:20] &gt;&gt; we begin to live beneath our privileges,
[52:24] &gt;&gt; okay?
[52:25] &gt;&gt; We'll struggle when we should be walking
[52:27] in peace and we'll mop when we should be
[52:30] shouting the praises of God.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Bear with me as I build a foundation
[52:37] here tonight. like to go back to the
[52:40] Garden of Eden for just a minute in the
[52:41] fall. And we see that humanity, they
[52:45] needed to be rescued
[52:48] &gt;&gt; when Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of
[52:51] Eden. But we understand that the
[52:53] conflict did not just start in the
[52:56] Garden of Eden,
[52:57] &gt;&gt; but it started in heaven.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; And because of this war that raised
[53:01] between the devil and God, Satan was
[53:04] kicked out with a third of the angels.
[53:06] And then he brought this war to earth.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And when the serpent deceived Adam and
[53:13] Eve, sin entered into the world. It it
[53:17] bringing spiritual death and and
[53:19] separation from God.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; All right?
[53:22] &gt;&gt; I know we've heard all this before, so
[53:23] just bear with me here tonight. and and
[53:25] men fell from from eternal innocence
[53:29] into a state of sinfulness and which
[53:31] opened the door to the devil and his
[53:34] lies and his ability to bind the
[53:36] children of God. And in that moment of
[53:39] disobedience, it was then that Adam
[53:42] handed over the keys of dominion that
[53:44] God entrusted to him. And remember, God
[53:47] did say in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make
[53:50] man in our image and and and let them
[53:53] have dominion." And that dominion was
[53:56] ours.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; All right?
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? But when we sinned,
[54:00] we forfeited it and handed the devil a
[54:04] legal right to rule over followers
[54:05] humanity. I hope this is okay tonight.
[54:08] So the devil bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo
[54:09] bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo
[54:09] bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo
[54:09] bo bo bo bo boasted about having
[54:10] authority over the earth.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; But he overlooked one major factor. God
[54:16] had a redemption plan.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Satan thought when he caused the fall of
[54:22] man that the fall out out of a garden of
[54:25] perfection.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; He thought when he caused God's children
[54:29] to fall that he had pulled one over God.
[54:33] and he thought there's no way that God
[54:35] can ever get them out of this condition.
[54:38] But remember, God knows all things.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; And God knows the end from the
[54:42] beginning. And God seeing the fall of
[54:45] man. And God already had a lamb slain
[54:48] before the foundation of the world. God
[54:50] had a redemptive plan.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; God wasn't going to let you stay in that
[54:54] state that you were in. God wasn't going
[54:57] to let you stay in the torments and the
[54:58] binds of the devil. He had a plan. Yeah.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; And God wasn't caught off guard.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank God for that.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; God wasn't caught off guard when Adam
[55:08] and Eve fell.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; He wasn't pacing heaven thinking, "Oh
[55:12] my, how did this happen?" You see, in
[55:15] the same chapter when when man fell,
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:18] God promised in Genesis 3:15 that the
[55:22] seed of a woman
[55:25] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[55:26] &gt;&gt; would bruise the head of the serpent.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; That God had a plan. Oh my. And from the
[55:34] moment humanity's eyes was open to sin,
[55:36] God set in motion a a plan that would
[55:40] bring forth a deliverer.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for that. Oh my. looking
[55:46] at my life and what I've been through
[55:48] and what I've done. I think I'm thankful
[55:50] to God every day that he had a plan.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That he wasn't going to leave you
[55:56] in that condition.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; So, we see the plan of God was put into
[56:00] motion.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And we look at Noah's arc, a picture of
[56:03] salvation from judgment.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Hope that's okay. And
[56:07] &gt;&gt; the Passover lamb, it's deliverance by
[56:09] the blood of a spotless lamb. man, the
[56:12] tabernacle, a foreshadowing of
[56:14] atonement, and God's dwelling among his
[56:16] people.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus finally came on the
[56:19] scene, the angels announced in Luke
[56:21] 21:14, "Glory to God in the highest
[56:23] stand, and on earth peace, goodwill to
[56:25] towards men,
[56:27] &gt;&gt; and all of heaven recognized that the
[56:30] victor had arrived to wage war against
[56:32] sin and the devil and reclaim authority
[56:36] that Adam had lost."
[56:38] The angels knew.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; The angels knew when they came down they
[56:42] were they were so excited that they
[56:45] would see this that the power of sin
[56:47] destroyed.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; So we see when Jesus was nailed to the
[56:51] cross. I'm trying to hurry through this.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just a victim of Roman cruelty
[56:56] or or Jewish leaders uh uh jealousy. He
[56:59] was the lamb of God laying down his life
[57:03] &gt;&gt; as a final sacrifice. Colossians 2:14
[57:06] would describe it this way. Blotting out
[57:09] the handwriting of ordinances that was
[57:10] against us
[57:12] &gt;&gt; and took it out of the way, nailing it
[57:15] to the cross and having spoiled
[57:18] principalities
[57:20] &gt;&gt; and powers. He made a show of them
[57:22] openly triumphing over them.
[57:28] Praise the Lord.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; When God set this plan into motion, he
[57:31] knew
[57:32] &gt;&gt; that he would not fail.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; You know,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; there's a lot of things that I I I I uh
[57:38] can't do with my life. And there's a lot
[57:41] of times I go into situations knowing
[57:43] I'm probably going to fail.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; God didn't go into this situation
[57:48] thinking he was going to fail. Come on.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; When God put this plan into motion,
[57:54] Brother Patrick, God went in as someone
[57:57] that was confident that he was going to
[57:59] overcome.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; So, I love this phrase, make a show of
[58:04] them openly.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; It means not on the cross that that
[58:12] Jesus did more than just quietly win.
[58:15] Yeah.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; He took the devil's entire demonic host
[58:19] and lined them up and paraded them as
[58:22] defeated
[58:23] &gt;&gt; before heaven and earth,
[58:28] &gt;&gt; showing the people.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; That this thing that has held you bound
[58:35] for year after year after year has no
[58:38] power over you any longer. You say this
[58:40] is simple. Hear me out.
[58:43] Satan tonight has no authority over your
[58:46] life.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; You see, I can't give up this addiction.
[58:51] Well, I know a conqueror that has never
[58:53] been defeated.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is call on the
[58:56] name of Jesus, and he will help you
[58:59] overcome it.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; But picture a victorious king leading
[59:03] captives down Main Street for everyone
[59:05] to see. Yeah,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; that's what Jesus did with all the
[59:09] spiritual forces arrayed against you and
[59:11] I. He showed them up, took their
[59:14] authority, took the keys to the prison
[59:17] and said, "Now your hold over mankind is
[59:21] broken."
[59:22] &gt;&gt; The rule that Satan had over humanity
[59:25] for thousands and thousands of years was
[59:28] broken.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Now think about it. Of course, if Jesus
[59:32] had died and not risen, then every all
[59:34] of this plan would have been in vain.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; We would still be in trouble.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Death from the days of Adam had an
[59:43] unbreakable grip on humanity and
[59:46] everybody died. The Old Testament
[59:49] fathers passed away. The the prophets
[59:51] died. The the kings died. Righteous men
[59:53] and unrighteous alike passed. All ended
[59:56] up in the grave.
[59:58] But when Jesus came up on the scene, he
[1:00:00] wasn't just a man.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; He was God in a human body.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; So Jesus changed the script.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; He wasn't going to stay in the grave
[1:00:13] like every other man had before.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; What would be the purpose of Jesus
[1:00:17] coming to die if he would stay in the
[1:00:19] ground like every other man?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:00:24] But Jesus had to show that he had power
[1:00:27] over death, hell, and the grave. The
[1:00:30] Bible says in Matthew 28:2, it tells us
[1:00:33] there was a great earthquake.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; And the angel rolled the stone away,
[1:00:37] revealing that Jesus was no longer in
[1:00:40] the tomb. Let me say this. Jesus didn't
[1:00:43] just crawl out.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; He wasn't battered and nearly dead. He
[1:00:47] walked out fully alive and victorious.
[1:00:51] Our captain is not someone that has
[1:00:54] barely won. At the end of the match,
[1:00:56] people are are are wondering who won
[1:00:57] this match. No, I when it was all said
[1:01:01] and done, not one demon in hell had to
[1:01:03] wonder. They knew.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; They knew that this is not just a man,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; but this is God in flesh. When he rose
[1:01:12] from the grave, they knew.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. Our captain is the
[1:01:19] champion of champions.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; He's never lost the battle. He is the
[1:01:23] Lord mighty. I said mighty in battle.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; I know this is simple, but what I've
[1:01:30] come to do here today is to build your
[1:01:32] faith a little bit. Knowing that on your
[1:01:35] worst days, you got a captain that has
[1:01:38] never failed. Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; When you feel overwhelmed and you feel
[1:01:42] surrounded, remember the presence of God
[1:01:46] is always there,
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; you're never alone. I love that song.
[1:01:50] When it when it looks like I'm
[1:01:52] surrounded, I'm surrounded by him
[1:01:54] because it is so true. On the days you
[1:01:57] feel alone
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; and you feel discouraged and the
[1:02:01] sickness is in your body and you don't
[1:02:04] feel like you can make it through,
[1:02:05] remember
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:08] The presence of God is always there.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; He never leaves. He never forsakes.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; They say in the Bible days when
[1:02:21] a king would defeat another king in his
[1:02:24] kingdom that they would go in and cut
[1:02:27] the robe off of the defeated king.
[1:02:31] And the the king that won would take
[1:02:33] that robe and it would tie it to his
[1:02:36] own,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; showing that he defeated this king and
[1:02:40] how mighty in battle this king is. And
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; so when a king would come into his his
[1:02:45] his throne room, they would look at the
[1:02:49] robe that this king had. And however
[1:02:52] long the train of this king was shows
[1:02:55] how powerful this king is. Isaiah 6:1
[1:02:59] says, "In the year that King Uzziah
[1:03:01] died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:03:04] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; his robe
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; filled the temple.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; He was so powerful,
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; so strong, so mighty in battle that is
[1:03:19] trained
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; that is trained." showing that he has
[1:03:23] never been defeated
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; and he never will. Here tonight,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; his train filled the temple. Oh my, what
[1:03:31] a sight that would have been.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; To see a king walk out with maybe 10, 12
[1:03:37] robes saying, "My, what a powerful
[1:03:40] king." But oh to be Uzziah and to say
[1:03:43] that his train filled the temple.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Go ahead.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; When he rose from the grave, he made an
[1:03:52] open statement
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; that I have the keys of hell
[1:03:57] and of death here tonight.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; as I continue on, the last fear that has
[1:04:04] paralyzed humanity is the fear of death.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But when Christ rose from the grave,
[1:04:10] death lost his grip on humanity.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He robbed the grave of its victory. And
[1:04:17] the sting of death was neutralized by
[1:04:19] the power of the resurrection.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear death.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be afraid of death.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Do you love him here tonight?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; But we see that Jesus has the keys to
[1:04:36] death, hell.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And the grave. And if I can say this
[1:04:41] here tonight that one of the greatest
[1:04:43] problems that the church has today, it
[1:04:45] is so worried about the enemy that is
[1:04:48] present with them that they forget who's
[1:04:51] fighting for them.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; We get so worried about the obstacle
[1:04:57] that we're facing right in our present
[1:04:59] time at the moment in life right there
[1:05:02] that we forget who is fighting for us.
[1:05:07] We can look at the children of Israel
[1:05:08] and see them get to the Red Sea. What
[1:05:10] happened? They begin to complain.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; They they said, "Did you bring us out
[1:05:16] here to die?" They forgot the miracles
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; that God just brought them out of Egypt
[1:05:22] with.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; We get so worried about the finances
[1:05:27] that we're dealing with and the the
[1:05:29] sickness and depression, oppression,
[1:05:30] whatever it may be. Everyone's different
[1:05:32] here tonight. Whatever you face, we get
[1:05:34] so bombarded and overwhelmed with the
[1:05:37] circumstance that we forget the God that
[1:05:40] fights for us.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Kobe, this giant is
[1:05:46] too big and these walls are too thick
[1:05:48] and the spirit is too powerful." Brother
[1:05:50] Brenham says here, "You got to get
[1:05:52] determined."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. Get ready. Take
[1:05:56] over." God said, "Let's take over."
[1:05:59] Excuse
[1:06:02] me.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's what God wanted us to do. That's
[1:06:08] what God wants us to do tonight. God's
[1:06:10] always willing to give us if you're
[1:06:12] ready to receive it. That's right. God's
[1:06:15] made the promise, so it's ours.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; God made the promise, so it's ours. The
[1:06:22] promise is unto you and to your
[1:06:23] children, and to them that's a far off,
[1:06:26] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:06:28] call. So the promise is here. This is a
[1:06:31] a lengthy quote, so just bear with me.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus or Joshua and Caleb when they went
[1:06:35] over, I like the thought there.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; When they came over, the 10 came back
[1:06:39] and said, "Oh, we look like grasshoppers
[1:06:42] up the side of them."
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And Joshua and Caleb says, "We can do
[1:06:46] it." That's right. Why? Because God
[1:06:49] promised that we can do it. God says we
[1:06:52] can do it. God promised our fathers that
[1:06:55] we was going. there was a land that
[1:06:57] belonged to us. No matter if they got
[1:07:00] walt cities, they look like giants and
[1:07:02] everything else. He quit looking at the
[1:07:05] giants. I think that's something we need
[1:07:06] to do. Quit looking at the giants, he
[1:07:08] says, and start looking at God's word.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; And when men and women quit looking at
[1:07:13] their sickness and their diseases and
[1:07:15] start looking to what God said about it,
[1:07:18] you will take over. He says, "Amen." All
[1:07:21] things are subject to Jesus Christ. All
[1:07:24] things are subject to you in prayer, he
[1:07:27] says, when you ask in his name and
[1:07:29] believe it. Amen. Ask what you will in
[1:07:33] my name and it shall be done. He said,
[1:07:35] that's right. Whatsoever things you
[1:07:37] desire when you pray, believe it and you
[1:07:41] shall receive it and you shall have it.
[1:07:43] God said so. So let nothing stand in
[1:07:47] your way. Stop looking at the things
[1:07:49] you're looking at here. Look to the
[1:07:51] unseen. God said we can do it.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful for that here tonight?
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; God said it and I believe it.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; That should settle the questions in your
[1:08:03] mind.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; But looking at these keys for just a
[1:08:08] minute as
[1:08:10] we try to wrap this up. I'm not going to
[1:08:12] keep you long here tonight. But keys
[1:08:13] mean authority.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Now look this up. says in the ancient
[1:08:19] world possessing the keys meant you have
[1:08:22] the right to lock or unlock to bind or
[1:08:28] to release. So when scripture says that
[1:08:30] Jesus holds the keys to hell and death
[1:08:33] it means Satan no longer calls the
[1:08:36] shots.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Satan no longer calls the shots. We
[1:08:42] don't have to remain locked in sin. We
[1:08:45] don't have to remain attained to
[1:08:48] addiction. And we certainly don't have
[1:08:50] to fear the grave.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; It means the one who lives forever has
[1:08:55] the power to set the captives free here
[1:08:58] tonight. Oh, thank God for that. I was
[1:09:01] bound,
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; but thank God he set me free.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Jesus didn't just conquer the
[1:09:08] devil. He ransomed us.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; He paid the price for us. All right.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Think of a person kidnapped by by
[1:09:16] bandits and and no matter how strong
[1:09:19] that person is, they they can't easily
[1:09:22] free themselves and they needed a
[1:09:24] rescuer, someone who was willing to come
[1:09:27] and pay the price
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; to take them out of the chains that they
[1:09:31] were in. And you look at what God did
[1:09:33] for us. He ransomed us with his precious
[1:09:37] blood.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; All right? Satan thought humanity was
[1:09:41] forever bound to him after the fall. But
[1:09:43] Jesus through his blood purchased us
[1:09:46] back, closing the chasm that was between
[1:09:49] God and man.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's why I love to sing songs
[1:09:54] like He set me free. Because it's not
[1:09:56] just a pretty tune, but it's a reality
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; that he set me free.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; That we've been redeemed by the blood of
[1:10:04] the lamb. And devil, you can't have me
[1:10:06] anymore. You have no clay because you
[1:10:09] have no keys.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for that.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the same spirit that
[1:10:22] raised up Jesus from the dead, if it
[1:10:25] dwells in you, what is that? Romans
[1:10:27] 8:11.
[1:10:29] That it will quicken your mortal bodies.
[1:10:33] that Holy Ghost power.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; That resurrection power that's inside of
[1:10:38] you.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute. God
[1:10:43] didn't give us a a a a a mild
[1:10:46] improvement of what he had.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; God gave us something that has stood the
[1:10:50] test of time.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And what God used to defeat the devil,
[1:10:54] he gave the same thing to us.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; We look at warfare. Imagine,
[1:11:01] brother Merl using World War I
[1:11:05] uh uh uh weapons to fight today's war.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't work. It's like I think
[1:11:11] brother Michael showed us a video of
[1:11:14] Afghanistan or some guys over there
[1:11:16] shooting tanks with machine guns.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; What is that going to do?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; It does nothing. And that's like us
[1:11:24] trying in our own ability against
[1:11:26] Satan's tactics. us coming up with our
[1:11:29] machine guns when he has a take.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; But remember, when you align your life
[1:11:34] up with God
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; and you take the power of God, you no
[1:11:38] longer just have a take, but you got an
[1:11:40] atomic bomb.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that he gave us
[1:11:44] the greatest weapon that we could ever
[1:11:46] ask for. That was his word. It doesn't
[1:11:49] need improve me. Improving.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need to be modified. If it
[1:11:54] was good for Christ 2,000 years ago,
[1:11:57] it's good for me.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Think about it. If we can just realize
[1:12:10] who we are here tonight
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; and the power that lays inside of you.
[1:12:16] Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; If we could just get to a place as
[1:12:20] individuals, as a church
[1:12:23] to see what God can do with a unified
[1:12:25] body, think about what God can do for a
[1:12:28] unified church.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; That gets under the headship of God and
[1:12:32] aligns themsself with his word.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Think about the power. Oh my goodness.
[1:12:38] Healings can happen and deliverances can
[1:12:41] happen. Addictions can be broken. Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Your children could be set free.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Your children could be filled with the
[1:12:49] Holy Ghost.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Sinners can walk off the street and be
[1:12:52] set free by the power of God.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; That's what Satan's afraid of is a
[1:12:56] unified body.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; That's why he tries to put division and
[1:13:00] keep us pulled apart.
[1:13:03] He knows if the bride can just unify
[1:13:07] themselves under the word and the
[1:13:09] message that was brought,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; you can shake the gates of hell with
[1:13:14] your prayers.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; You step out of bed, Satan ought to
[1:13:18] tremble.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Satan ought to be scared
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; of the power that you possess.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; That's why he don't want you recognizing
[1:13:27] who you are. If he keep you blind to the
[1:13:30] world and its pleasures and the
[1:13:32] addiction and keep you blind to being
[1:13:35] satisfied to just go to church and keep
[1:13:37] you blind with reading your Bible once a
[1:13:40] month, he's okay with that.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; He's okay with that. He don't mind you
[1:13:46] going to church and he don't mind you
[1:13:48] listening to the prophet maybe once a
[1:13:50] month and he don't mind you reading your
[1:13:52] Bible every now and then.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; He don't mind you living in a state of
[1:13:56] lukewarmness. He doesn't care. He don't
[1:13:58] mind. But when you begin to look into
[1:14:02] the scriptures and and listen to the
[1:14:03] message for yourself and when you really
[1:14:06] begin to recognize who you are,
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Satan begins to take notice them.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't care before. You were like
[1:14:14] everybody else.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay tonight.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:14:27] We all want victory and I'm almost done.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; But every victory comes costs.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; There are obstacles that we have to
[1:14:38] overcome.
[1:14:44] We got to overcome fear and doubt.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; We got to overcome
[1:14:50] the struggles of life. We got to
[1:14:53] overcome any any sin that can easily
[1:14:56] beset us.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; We We've got to overcome the not
[1:15:01] understanding who we are. And we got to
[1:15:04] overcome lukewarmness.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; We got to overcome being content in the
[1:15:10] condition that we're in.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; There's obstacles to victory.
[1:15:17] As I've said before, I I'll probably
[1:15:19] wear this out, but anything worth having
[1:15:22] is worth fighting for.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; You want the Holy Ghost? You really
[1:15:26] think it's going to be that easy?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; You really think Satan is going to make
[1:15:31] it easy on you?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's easy. Christ already paid
[1:15:35] the price. You accept it. But getting
[1:15:37] our mind in that condition and trying to
[1:15:39] push everything out.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Do you realize? Have you seen when you
[1:15:44] try to get down to pray and read your
[1:15:45] Bible and listen to a message, how your
[1:15:47] mind just becomes all cluttered?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; You begin to think of things that you
[1:15:52] have to do tomorrow and have to do right
[1:15:54] now and oh man, I need to get up. Did I
[1:15:56] forget to take the pot off the the oven
[1:15:57] or did I turn the water off or did I do
[1:15:59] this? Did I do that? Did I did I do this
[1:16:01] at the job? our mind becomes so
[1:16:03] cluttered
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; because Satan knows if you can get into
[1:16:07] true prayer
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; into true prayer
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; where it's more than just words
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; but you've stepped from this dimension
[1:16:20] into another where you're in the
[1:16:22] presence of God if he knows
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; that's why he he makes it so difficult
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; because he knows Satan's smart. Satan
[1:16:33] knows.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; But in all of the aspects of life, we
[1:16:40] got someone that's already overcame for
[1:16:42] you.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Fear and doubt. Too many believers live
[1:16:47] in fear. Fear of failure and fear of the
[1:16:49] unknown and fear that God won't come
[1:16:51] through. Yet the Bible says, "God hath
[1:16:54] not given us
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; a spirit of fear,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:17:04] mind." Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; In a world where people are losing their
[1:17:08] mind, as Dan was talking about the other
[1:17:10] day, the rise of of of mental illness,
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; God promised that in the midst of this,
[1:17:18] I will give you a sound mind.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; we don't have to fear losing our
[1:17:26] children to the world.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear losing our our
[1:17:31] families to the grips of the devil. We
[1:17:34] don't have to fear
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; in this world where Satan has it his
[1:17:38] way. We can live in a state of peace.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; With a sound mind.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important. I remember
[1:17:49] growing up and with with with addictions
[1:17:52] and things that I was faced and dad
[1:17:53] always
[1:17:58] took us back to scripture because
[1:18:00] anything that you deal with in life
[1:18:02] there is a scripture pertaining to that.
[1:18:05] There's nothing new under the sun.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; So any obstacle that you have in your
[1:18:13] life there is a word to help you
[1:18:17] overcome it.
[1:18:19] growing up and dealing with addictions
[1:18:20] in life, dad would always have us go
[1:18:22] back and look up. If it was lying, look,
[1:18:26] look up all the scriptures on lying.
[1:18:27] Man, if it was stealing, look up all the
[1:18:30] scriptures on stealing. If it was lust,
[1:18:32] whatever it was, get into the word. I
[1:18:35] was talking to the young people last
[1:18:36] night. I was telling them, align
[1:18:39] yourself up with the word.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; How are you going to align yourself up
[1:18:43] with something that you have no clue
[1:18:45] what is it about?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; That's true. If you have no idea what
[1:18:48] this word is, how are you going to
[1:18:50] overcome?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; How are you going to align yourself with
[1:18:54] the scriptures that's pertaining to you?
[1:18:56] If you have no idea what this book says,
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; but we must align our thoughts,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; our our our priorities, everything up
[1:19:06] with the word of God.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; And in the time of your need, in the
[1:19:11] time of your crisis, God will bring back
[1:19:14] to the remembrance the words of power.
[1:19:18] Yes, sir.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. I
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; been up here for
[1:19:28] 45 minutes.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to keep you long tonight.
[1:19:33] But another thing that we must overcome
[1:19:35] is lukewarmness.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Believers getting complacent.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Hope that's okay.
[1:19:47] We stop praying as as much as we need to
[1:19:49] and we get in a state to where we're
[1:19:53] okay where we're at.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; God does not want you being content
[1:19:59] where you're at.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; If you're in a walk with the Lord,
[1:20:03] you're always moving higher
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; and higher and higher. When you feel
[1:20:07] yourself stall, that's not God.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; That's the devil trying to make you
[1:20:13] happy where you're at. All right.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; But remember, with God, we're always
[1:20:18] moving up
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; until one day we're going to leave this
[1:20:21] earth. Oh my.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; my goodness. I better stop here.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Do you love him here tonight?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Skip through some of this here.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. you love him.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; So the to the victor goes the spoils.
[1:20:50] Give me a few more minutes.
[1:20:53] We see with David and Goliath. After
[1:20:55] David slew the Goliath,
[1:20:57] Israel gained the spoils of the
[1:20:59] Philistines and David's boldness in God
[1:21:02] brought victory.
[1:21:04] See Jehoshaphat. When Judah faced an
[1:21:08] impossible
[1:21:10] circumstance, they began to worship the
[1:21:13] Lord and God set traps and the enemy
[1:21:17] armies destroyed each other. And Judah
[1:21:19] found so much spoil it took them three
[1:21:22] days
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; to collect it all. We see Paul and Silas
[1:21:25] in Acts 16 that they were beaten and
[1:21:27] imprisoned and and put in stalks. But at
[1:21:30] midnight they prayed
[1:21:32] and sang praises and an earthquake
[1:21:34] loosened every prisoner's chains and the
[1:21:37] jailer got saved.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; The spoils of that victory included
[1:21:42] souls added to the kingdom of God.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Every victory that you face, there
[1:21:52] spoils with that. All right.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Every victory that you overcome or every
[1:21:57] obstacle you overcome, there's spoils
[1:21:59] that go with that victory.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; You know, people say that, you know,
[1:22:06] Bible times, they're different. And and
[1:22:09] we're in a modern time. We're in a
[1:22:10] modern society. And people aren't
[1:22:12] interested in the gospel anymore. And
[1:22:15] the days of miracles have passed.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Do we serve a dead God or a live God
[1:22:22] here tonight?
[1:22:25] Do we serve a God that has failed or has
[1:22:27] never failed?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Do we serve a God that says, "I am God
[1:22:31] and I change not."
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; The same power
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; that was there in
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; in the book of Acts is the same power
[1:22:40] today. Let the devil say the days of
[1:22:42] miracles have passed. I really don't
[1:22:44] care. The same power
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; that Christ had then the bride has
[1:22:49] today.
[1:22:51] He has restored that authority to you
[1:22:53] again.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And with victory, our spoils come in the
[1:23:03] form of lives, families restored, and
[1:23:06] miracles taking place and and seeing
[1:23:09] people set free and having your joy
[1:23:11] restored again.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[1:23:16] one day
[1:23:19] we'll be We be before the throne of
[1:23:21] Christ and laying our crowns down.
[1:23:25] One day all the fighting
[1:23:28] that we have faced in our life
[1:23:32] will finally be home.
[1:23:37] The final victory
[1:23:40] over the devil
[1:23:44] as the musicians come now.
[1:23:51] Don't give up.
[1:23:53] Don't give up.
[1:23:56] Don't get discouraged. You say, "Brother
[1:23:58] Colobby, I feel like I've I'm losing
[1:24:00] more battles than winning right now."
[1:24:03] Maybe you're thinking, "Preacher, I've
[1:24:04] heard you talk about the victories and
[1:24:06] but my life is a mess and my family's
[1:24:09] maybe in disarray or my my bills have
[1:24:14] this how I feel most of the time. I got
[1:24:15] more bills than money.
[1:24:19] The bills are piling up. I'm dealing
[1:24:21] with sickness and and anger and
[1:24:23] depression." Remember, the devil wants
[1:24:25] to isolate you,
[1:24:29] make you feel that you're alone and that
[1:24:31] no one cares. We was talking at brother
[1:24:33] Robert's house a few weeks back and
[1:24:35] talking about isolation and what pride
[1:24:38] will do to a person.
[1:24:41] Humanity can get so proud that they
[1:24:44] would rather deal with the situation
[1:24:45] alone than ask for help.
[1:24:49] And Satan, if he can get you isolated,
[1:24:51] thinking that no one cares and that no
[1:24:54] one can relate to you and and that that
[1:24:56] that that you're alone,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Satan will whoop you if he can get you
[1:25:03] isolated.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in Hebrews 13 and5
[1:25:08] that I will never leave thee. Oh, thank
[1:25:11] God for that.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Nor will I forsake you. Remind the devil
[1:25:16] tonight if he's trying to isolate you.
[1:25:19] Remind him and say you don't have the
[1:25:22] keys anymore.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; That you don't have the keys anymore.
[1:25:27] That Jesus Christ does. So that means
[1:25:30] the jail cell of discouragement can't
[1:25:32] keep you locked in forever.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; The jail cell of isolation cannot keep
[1:25:37] you locked forever. Satan has opened
[1:25:40] every door. I mean, Jesus has opened
[1:25:43] every door here tonight.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is walk out.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Walk out in freedom.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; See, Lord, I I don't know what we're
[1:25:56] facing tonight. I know what I face,
[1:26:00] what I deal with,
[1:26:03] how the struggles of life can be real.
[1:26:09] Just so glad
[1:26:11] that through it all, thinking of that
[1:26:14] song that grandpa and grandma sing for
[1:26:15] years. Through it all, we got someone
[1:26:18] that we can depend upon.
[1:26:21] Through it all, I've learned to trust in
[1:26:23] Jesus. And when the battle's over,
[1:26:27] when the battle's over, we should wear a
[1:26:30] crown here tonight. Gracious heavenly
[1:26:33] father, I know this was simple.
[1:26:38] But Lord, this is what you placed on my
[1:26:40] heart here tonight
[1:26:44] that we're in a war and a battle for our
[1:26:46] life and a battle for our families,
[1:26:51] the battle for our spouses and children,
[1:26:54] Lord, and and the battle, Lord, for the
[1:26:57] young people.
[1:27:00] a battle, Lord, where
[1:27:02] Satan's trying to divide and isolate us,
[1:27:05] Lord. Making the young people just
[1:27:08] feel all alone, making the elders and
[1:27:10] the adults, myself included. Lord,
[1:27:12] there's been times he's whispered,
[1:27:13] "You're just all alone and to isolate
[1:27:16] us. But Lord,
[1:27:19] we're in a battle. Father, you've
[1:27:21] overcame everything that we go through
[1:27:23] in life.
[1:27:25] And you opened up the jail cells for
[1:27:27] everyone here. Whatever we're facing,
[1:27:30] depression, lust, pornography,
[1:27:32] isolation,
[1:27:34] sickness in the body, or maybe in the
[1:27:36] mind, Lord, or whatever it is, a
[1:27:40] homosexual spirit, Lord, I don't know
[1:27:41] what we're facing, but Lord, you do. I
[1:27:45] pray that your spirit comes down tonight
[1:27:47] and opens
[1:27:49] every cell, Lord, and let them know that
[1:27:51] they don't have to stay in that prison,
[1:27:54] but you've broke every chain and you got
[1:27:58] the keys tonight
[1:28:00] to whatever they're facing. Lord, uplift
[1:28:03] the feeble tonight, Lord. the ones that
[1:28:06] have been fighting sickness. Father, I
[1:28:09] can only imagine, Lord, how the devil's
[1:28:12] plaguing grandpa and and
[1:28:15] Lord, Uncle Donald, Aunt Angie, Lord,
[1:28:17] Angie Bendabout, the ones McDougall,
[1:28:20] Lord, the ones that have been fighting
[1:28:21] these these battles for so long. I pray
[1:28:24] you lift them up, Lord.
[1:28:27] Don't let the devil plague their mind,
[1:28:30] but Father, lift up their hands and let
[1:28:33] them know that you've overcome every
[1:28:36] enemy tonight. We love you, Lord. Thank
[1:28:39] you for your mercy and goodness.
[1:28:42] Thank you, Father, for never leaving us
[1:28:44] alone.
[1:28:46] We love you, Lord. In your precious and
[1:28:48] lovely name,
[1:28:51] we pray.
[1:28:53] We've been made more than coner
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:02] overs
[1:29:03] in this life.
[1:29:09] Oh, we've been made
[1:29:12] victorious.
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:18] The blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:24] We've made Oh, we've been made more than
[1:29:29] coner.
[1:29:32] Yes, we have.
[1:29:34] Overcomers in this day.
[1:29:39] We've been made and we've been made
[1:29:43] victorious
[1:29:48] through the blood of Jesus. Can we go up
[1:29:51] another key? We've been made
[1:29:54] We've been made more than coner.
[1:29:59] Is that your confession tonight?
[1:30:02] Overcomers
[1:30:04] in this life.
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:09] Oh, we've been made
[1:30:12] victorious
[1:30:17] through the blood of Jes. Verse one. Now
[1:30:21] just as Christ
[1:30:23] and trouble
[1:30:27] may come knocking at your door. Don't be
[1:30:31] afraid tonight. Don't be afraid.
[1:30:35] You know it's not like before.
[1:30:40] And don't you give in. Don't let it
[1:30:44] bring you down.
[1:30:48] You don't have to worry anymore.
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:55] For we've been made
[1:30:58] more than coner,
[1:31:04] overcomeers
[1:31:05] in this life.
[1:31:09] We've been made. We've been made
[1:31:14] victorious
[1:31:19] through the blood of Jesus
[1:31:22] Christ.
[1:31:24] Hold on. and hold on.
[1:31:28] We're getting stronger every day. Yes,
[1:31:32] we are. There's no reason. There's no
[1:31:35] reason
[1:31:36] for you to go astray.
[1:31:41] Don't you lean to your own
[1:31:45] understanding.
[1:31:48] Just lean on him and we'll all save.
[1:31:56] Oh, we've been made more than coner.
[1:32:02] Thank you, Lord. Overcomers
[1:32:06] in this life.
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:11] Oh, we've been made
[1:32:14] victorious
[1:32:19] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:25] Give me your hand.
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:29] Let's agree together
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:34] that all of our eneies
[1:32:39] will crumble at our feet.
[1:32:44] Whatever we bind on earth
[1:32:48] shall be bound in heaven
[1:32:53] at the name of Jesus.
[1:32:57] Oh my. Satan has to flee.
[1:33:02] Oh, we've got the power
[1:33:07] in the name of Jesus.
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:22] Oh, Satan raes.
[1:33:26] We cannot be defeated.
[1:33:31] We've got the power
[1:33:36] in the name of the Lord
[1:33:40] for many years now.
[1:33:45] Satan's tried to stop that.
[1:33:49] But the bride of Jesus,
[1:33:54] she's still alive.
[1:33:57] Oh yes. Like a mighty army.
[1:34:03] We've been marching onward. Oh yes.
[1:34:08] winning every battle
[1:34:13] with the Lord. All together now. Sing it
[1:34:17] with all of your heart. The power
[1:34:22] in the name of Jesus.
[1:34:27] We've got the power
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:31] in the name of the Lord.
[1:34:36] Though Satan raes,
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:40] we cannot be defeated.
[1:34:45] We've got the power
[1:34:50] in the name of the Lord.
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:55] Glory to God. Glory to God.
[1:35:01] Well, isn't God just wonderful to us
[1:35:04] tonight? Aren't you glad that Amen. that
[1:35:08] you get the spoils of the victory?
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need the spoils of the
[1:35:13] victory. We ought to we every time the
[1:35:16] devil comes, we He should He should lose
[1:35:19] land. Amen.
[1:35:22] Every time he comes in, I'm gaining more
[1:35:26] land, more victory, taking more spoil.
[1:35:29] Can you say amen? Well, glory to God.
[1:35:32] And aren't you glad for the Lord here
[1:35:34] tonight? Amen.
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:40] Hallelujah. Amen. Uh, Brother Kobe
[1:35:44] quoted that scripture, made a show of
[1:35:46] him openly. Amen. He didn't he didn't
[1:35:50] privately win, but he made a show of it.
[1:35:53] Amen. Satan is defeated.
[1:35:57] Praise the Lord. And that's one thing
[1:36:00] that that, you know, Satan really tries
[1:36:03] to do is to isolate us and to make us
[1:36:06] think that we're the only ones that
[1:36:08] battle. We're the only ones that
[1:36:10] struggle in our minds. We're the only
[1:36:12] ones that struggle with certain parts of
[1:36:14] our of this this old nature, different
[1:36:17] different things. And and but but that's
[1:36:21] just one of his tactics. That's one of
[1:36:23] his tactics. Listen, we are all in a
[1:36:26] war. were in a war and and the Amen. So
[1:36:32] So here in this little brigade brigade
[1:36:35] here in in Pawn, Oklahoma, Amen. We're
[1:36:38] just a small portion. Uh but God's
[1:36:40] ordained us to win in this part of the
[1:36:43] country.
[1:36:45] He's ordained us to fight the devils
[1:36:47] here. And I guarantee you the devils
[1:36:50] that we're fighting here's the same kind
[1:36:52] of devils that they're fighting in Ohio
[1:36:54] or fighting in in uh I in Virginia,
[1:36:58] Arizona, wherever else. Amen. But we've
[1:37:01] got to fight in our territory. And I say
[1:37:04] we are going to fight and we are going
[1:37:06] to win. We are winning. We have won. We
[1:37:09] will win.
[1:37:11] Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] Amen. and and so uh I I think praise is
[1:37:17] so important. Amen. And and thanking God
[1:37:21] for all of his his grace upon our lives.
[1:37:24] So we enjoyed the word of the Lord here
[1:37:26] tonight. We appreciate that.
[1:37:30] I tell you what, the last the the the
[1:37:33] those last three services brother uh
[1:37:36] Josh ministered last Wednesday night, it
[1:37:38] was such an incredible blessing. And um
[1:37:43] and those that weren't here, you need to
[1:37:44] go back and listen to that. I'd
[1:37:46] encourage you to listen to all the last
[1:37:47] three. Uh uh uh well, not Sunday
[1:37:50] morning. I'm talking about Wednesday
[1:37:51] night, Sunday night, and this and this
[1:37:55] Wednesday night. I tell you what,
[1:37:56] Brother Kobe, Brother Michael, and
[1:37:59] Brother Josh,
[1:38:01] those guys have preached these last
[1:38:05] three services.
[1:38:06] They're always good preachers, but
[1:38:09] they've been really good. And I believe
[1:38:11] the Lord is preparing us for the for
[1:38:13] these meetings that are coming up. We
[1:38:15] get our get our faith get our faith up
[1:38:17] where it belongs. Listen, if you don't
[1:38:19] line up and I you know when I I was
[1:38:22] mentioning on the logos if I if now
[1:38:25] remember
[1:38:27] if you're fighting with this and and u I
[1:38:30] think it's cute watching people fight
[1:38:31] this. Well, I'm not well that's okay.
[1:38:34] Just stay defeated. But remember this
[1:38:37] must come logos. God's got it here. So
[1:38:42] if you can line this and this that that
[1:38:44] that that living word. Amen. As I've as
[1:38:49] I I had tried attempted to do the
[1:38:51] invisible God spoke. It came into that
[1:38:54] pillar of fire. It settles down into
[1:38:57] that believer.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you as long as you are lined
[1:39:02] up with that word, there is authority.
[1:39:05] That's the only way you have authority.
[1:39:07] That's the only way you overcome. It's
[1:39:09] not that you have authority on your own.
[1:39:11] It's that you are lined up with the
[1:39:15] present will of God and you have to win.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; You must win. And when we understand it
[1:39:23] is the will of God for the dead to be
[1:39:25] raised in this day. It is the will of
[1:39:27] God for rapture. It is the will of God
[1:39:30] to be healed in our minds. Amen. It is
[1:39:33] the will. just line up. Then this word
[1:39:36] becomes logos living
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, do you love him?
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, God bless
[1:39:47] you. Amen. I um it's good to have it's
[1:39:51] good to have brother Robert and sister
[1:39:53] Brianna back home. And um I know they
[1:39:56] must be wore out
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:40:00] uh week over there. I know of such a
[1:40:03] tragic week. Um but I'm sure they were a
[1:40:06] great comfort to um Esther and the boys
[1:40:10] and and grandpa and grandma and those
[1:40:12] those over there. And so we pray God's
[1:40:15] blessings upon them. Uh brother William
[1:40:18] text me last night and said he had made
[1:40:19] it in uh uh yesterday evening. I don't
[1:40:23] know 8 or 9:00 somewhere in there. They
[1:40:26] had made it home. And so, uh, man, uh,
[1:40:29] they they had a long drive. And so, uh,
[1:40:34] so we we, um, we got a revival starting
[1:40:39] this next Thursday, or not tomorrow, a
[1:40:41] week from tomorrow. So, um, let's be in
[1:40:44] real earnest prayer. And let's do that.
[1:40:46] Let's, you know, um, really spend some
[1:40:49] take some extra time in the evening. You
[1:40:52] and your families get together. Even
[1:40:54] come down here if you wish. But but
[1:40:56] let's let's get together and and um uh
[1:40:59] however in your homes here and um just
[1:41:03] ask the Lord just start pouring our
[1:41:04] hearts out, emptying ourselves out and
[1:41:06] say, "Lord, fill me." We've got some
[1:41:09] wonderful men that are are are very
[1:41:12] gifted. These these men are have
[1:41:14] wonderful gifts in their lives. And I'm
[1:41:17] just believing the Lord is going to
[1:41:19] minister to every need that is present.
[1:41:22] How many has needs? You know, we've got
[1:41:25] to admit that we have needs and we can't
[1:41:27] talk from both sides of our mouth. We
[1:41:29] can't say, "I need help." And then
[1:41:30] refuse help when help is is is come.
[1:41:33] Amen. You you you've got to you've got
[1:41:35] to look at yourself and say, "I cannot
[1:41:38] win without God's help."
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way he's going to
[1:41:43] help you is through his word. And so as
[1:41:46] the word is coming this week, that that
[1:41:49] word is coming as Lord, Father, I I just
[1:41:52] want you to remove everything from my
[1:41:54] mind. Remove everything from my heart.
[1:41:57] Take everything. And Lord, let your word
[1:42:01] let your word anchor in. You know, the
[1:42:03] areas you're needing. I I I just I I
[1:42:06] just believe God's going to come and
[1:42:08] walk down these aisles this week. He's
[1:42:11] going to minister to needs.
[1:42:13] He's going to meet you right at your
[1:42:16] pew.
[1:42:18] Amen. I'm expecting him to meet me at
[1:42:20] mine.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I sure am. And so uh I'm I'm
[1:42:26] looking forward to that. Um, so I guess

[1:43:24] house, um there are people that have
