[42:21] um praise the Lord we're just so glad to
[42:25] to be uh uh a Christian here today so
[42:30] glad to be called a Son of
[42:33] God here in Luke 7 and 36 and one of the
[42:38] Pharisees desired him
[42:41] Jesus that he would eat with
[42:46] him and he went you
[42:49] know brother brandham says Jesus will
[42:53] always go where he is
[42:55] invited and he went into to the
[42:57] Pharisees house and sat down to
[43:00] meet and behold a woman in the city
[43:02] which was a sinner when she knew that
[43:05] Jesus set at meat in the Pharisees house
[43:07] brought an alabaster box of
[43:10] ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[43:12] him
[43:13] weeping and began to wash his feet with
[43:16] tears and did wipe them with the hairs
[43:20] of her head and kissed his feet and
[43:22] anointed them with
[43:24] ointment and when the Pharisee with
[43:27] which had bidden him saw it he spake
[43:30] within himself saying this man if he
[43:33] were a
[43:34] prophet would have known who and what
[43:37] manner of woman this is that toucheth
[43:39] him for she is a
[43:41] sinner and Jesus answering said unto him
[43:44] Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee
[43:47] and he said Master say on there was a
[43:50] certain creditor which had two debtors
[43:54] the one owed 500 P the other
[43:57] 50 and when they had nothing to pay he
[44:00] frankly forgave them both tell me
[44:02] therefore which of them will love him
[44:05] most Simon answered and said I suppose
[44:09] that he to whom he forgave most and he
[44:13] said unto him thou has rightly
[44:15] judged and he turned to the woman and
[44:17] said unto Simon seest thou this woman I
[44:21] entered into thine house and thou gavest
[44:24] me no water for my feet but shees washed
[44:27] my feet with tears and wiped them with
[44:30] the hairs of her head thou gavest me no
[44:33] kiss but this woman since the time that
[44:36] I came in hath not ceased to kiss my
[44:40] feet my head with oil thou D not anoint
[44:46] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[44:48] with
[44:49] ointment wherefore I say unto thee her
[44:52] sins which are many yes are
[44:55] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[44:58] little Is Forgiven the same loveth
[45:02] little and he said unto her thy sins are
[45:06] forgiven and they that said it meet with
[45:09] him begin to say within themselves who
[45:12] is this that forgiveth sins also and he
[45:16] said to the woman thy faith hath saved
[45:20] thee go in
[45:23] peace let's bow our heads father

[45:32] sober

[47:03] Christ can the church say
[47:05] amen and amen God bless
[47:08] you you may be
[47:13] seated
[47:15] we want to maybe title this this morning
[47:18] the cost of my
[47:21] praise
[47:23] the the cost there many people doesn't
[47:27] know what's behind when you see someone
[47:30] who is a
[47:32] worshipper when you see someone I was
[47:35] in last year um as we were at brother
[47:39] Ben prutz and while I was
[47:43] preaching there was a uh a lady there
[47:48] that
[47:48] was um worshipping and up on her feet
[47:52] and coming up the aisle and and um
[47:58] uh she just tears in her eyes as we
[48:01] preached
[48:02] and and finally I stopped and I said you
[48:05] know for those who don't know and maybe
[48:08] you're wondering what this what's wrong
[48:11] with this
[48:13] woman I said if You' have known this
[48:16] woman
[48:17] before this woman at one time had her
[48:20] hair cut like oh like a Butch and uh
[48:24] tattoos all over and the last time I was
[48:27] in service with her she was a woman that
[48:30] was bound in sin and bound in shame and
[48:34] she looked as she looked around and seen
[48:36] all of the beautiful women and the she
[48:39] felt out of place but it's been one year
[48:42] since I've seen this lady and now this
[48:44] lady is a beautiful Christian
[48:48] and she is throwing everything she can
[48:51] at me right now because she wants God to
[48:55] know that she a
[48:57] appreciates yes sir what he done for
[49:00] her I think we should never we should
[49:03] never
[49:04] forget what God has done for
[49:08] us as we look here at this story and
[49:12] it's the story of our
[49:14] master and of a
[49:17] Pharisee and a sinner brother brandham
[49:20] would preach a sermon an entire sermon
[49:23] on this and called washing jesus' feet
[49:25] and
[49:27] and we look at this self-styled Pharisee
[49:30] as as the Pharisees were an elite group
[49:34] of men they
[49:35] were they were schooled in the law they
[49:39] prided themselves in their
[49:41] knowledge they prided themselves in
[49:44] their lineage being able to take their
[49:47] lineage all the way back to
[49:50] Abraham they prided themselves in Moses
[49:54] the prophet they
[49:57] they they live their life in such a way
[50:01] to try to bring uh uh uh lift themselves
[50:07] in in such a a a way to where people
[50:11] would look at them and and see them as
[50:15] as as men of
[50:17] God these men were wealthy man who lived
[50:22] off of the tithing of the people and
[50:25] amen the the the the the sacrifices that
[50:29] were brought in they and their families
[50:31] would live uh very well they were and
[50:36] because of this and man it it the Israel
[50:40] had no uh middle class it was either a
[50:44] very rich people or a very poor people
[50:48] there was no in between and and so they
[50:52] felt that they were of a higher order
[50:54] and and um more higher than the Common
[50:59] Man and it was a common knowledge that
[51:03] each tried to outperform the other each
[51:06] of these Pharisees the scripture says
[51:08] that they would fast often out on the
[51:12] street corners and many many day uh uh
[51:15] two and uh uh three uh times a week
[51:19] would would go out with their very long
[51:21] prayers they'd have their fies and they
[51:24] would read prayers and and they would be
[51:27] on the street busy street corners so as
[51:29] to draw attention of their
[51:32] spirituality and man uh Jesus even
[51:35] mentioned that uh made mention that
[51:39] these Pharisees that fast and they have
[51:42] their long faces and they they they look
[51:46] mournful they want the people to see am
[51:50] man that they are giving honor to God
[51:54] and so as we look here of course if you
[51:57] were to look at the word Pharisee the
[51:59] very word
[52:01] Pharisee means actor amen they they were
[52:05] actors they were self-styled they were
[52:08] self-righteous in short they were
[52:11] Hypocrites man they longed for the
[52:14] Praises of men they wanted the Praises
[52:17] of men more than they wanted the Praises
[52:19] of God therefore they were out trying to
[52:24] to look holy and these men and uh went
[52:28] to Great uh uh steps in order to do this
[52:32] and so as we look at them and and how
[52:36] that they would give to the poor as long
[52:39] as there were cameras around if there
[52:40] were cameras and they would they would
[52:44] uh anything that they done they would do
[52:47] it amen in order to be seen by the
[52:51] people because their position mattered
[52:54] and and and so
[52:57] we look here that this Simon asking
[53:01] Jesus to come and a prophet would tell
[53:04] us he would say he would ask why would
[53:08] Simon the Pharisee invite Jesus to his
[53:12] place in the first
[53:14] place they had nothing in common Jesus
[53:18] was a poor man the Pharisee was a very
[53:22] rich man Jesus had no Seminary training
[53:27] amen he had he he was he he was
[53:32] criticized and mocked as illegitimate
[53:35] which was not allowed to be even a part
[53:38] of any kind of priest or Prophet these
[53:42] these men were trained from birth Amen
[53:46] to be priest they were they were brought
[53:48] up and they were tutored to be great
[53:52] men Jesus had the life and the words
[53:55] amen and the had the power of Heaven
[53:58] behind them but the Pharisees were
[54:02] nothing more than just actors and they
[54:05] amen uh they had nothing knew nothing
[54:08] about the Living God why would they ask
[54:13] Jesus to come why would he want Jesus to
[54:19] come and to be a part of of of his home
[54:24] amen birds of a feather flock together
[54:26] right
[54:27] amen the old people have things in
[54:29] common that's the that's the reason why
[54:31] we've got the old the golden eagle group
[54:33] you know we get together and amen and
[54:36] and um or for you old folks I just come
[54:38] to help Carrie canes and in uh Dentures
[54:42] amen but uh
[54:45] the uh the the you you the young people
[54:49] have have uh uh they they have things in
[54:53] common Hunters have things in common
[54:56] golfers have things in common fishermen
[54:59] have things in common amen single women
[55:02] have things in common married women have
[55:04] things in common we all have things in
[55:06] common Jesus and this Pharisee had
[55:10] absolutely nothing in
[55:12] common but yet Jesus was invited it's an
[55:17] incredible
[55:18] thing why would
[55:21] Jesus why would Jesus leave his campaign
[55:25] why would Jes Jesus stopped as as the
[55:28] prophet would say as The Courier was
[55:30] sent to find Jesus and and he searched
[55:34] through out Galilee and he wasn't here
[55:36] anymore he was here last week and he's
[55:38] but he's not there and he's went and he
[55:39] finally found him and and as they're
[55:41] trying to come up and get and as he's
[55:44] trying to get an audience with Jesus and
[55:46] and and and Andrew's standing there
[55:48] saying listen you can't get through this
[55:50] line the Master's just got from the
[55:51] pulpit he has just been praying he is
[55:54] tired we've got to let him go but The
[55:56] Courier says I've just got to say one
[55:59] thing to him he is I we want to invite
[56:02] him to Simon the Pharisees house Simon
[56:07] was a very he was a he was a very uh uh
[56:11] well-known man a great
[56:14] reputation and when Jesus heard it Jesus
[56:17] says tell your master that I will come I
[56:21] will visit with
[56:23] him Peter standing there saying listen
[56:25] master you know that there is a rabbit
[56:27] in the wood pile
[56:29] somewhere there is a reason why the
[56:32] Pharisee is asking you to come you know
[56:35] those guys and their
[56:37] tricks but Jesus says where I'm
[56:40] invited I will
[56:42] come Jesus will always come where he's
[56:45] invited can you say
[56:48] Amen even if he's going to be made fun
[56:50] of Jesus will come where he's
[56:52] invited you see what did this Pharisee
[56:56] he have up his sleeve amen seeing that
[56:59] he greatly despised
[57:02] Jesus brother bradam would tell us that
[57:04] the Pharisee was looking for some kind
[57:08] of a special attention to make him look
[57:12] like he
[57:13] was to to to to sort of put him on the
[57:17] map among all of the other the other
[57:19] phes and no one had ever invited Jesus
[57:23] to come into his home and to be a part
[57:25] of such a
[57:27] amen uh a a meal and a party as as the
[57:31] Pharisee was wanting to put on and he
[57:33] thought if I could just throw a big
[57:35] party amen I might be able to fit a
[57:38] little better in the ministerial uh H
[57:42] alliances and bring a little bit of
[57:45] attention to capernium and Galilee and
[57:49] and this he done and he and he and he
[57:51] looked he he he invited all of his high
[57:54] raking friends and he
[57:56] he brought in amen all of the Pharisees
[58:00] from around the country and all of the
[58:02] wealthy men of the city amen and and and
[58:06] he he worked very hard to get him there
[58:09] and and as the prophet would tell us he
[58:12] he killed the fatted Lambs and the
[58:14] calves and they put everything together
[58:18] and this was going to be quite an
[58:20] occasion for capernium it was going to
[58:23] bring people in from all over the
[58:25] country to be a part of
[58:27] this Jesus was going to be there and
[58:30] they were going to belittle Jesus they
[58:34] were going to make fun of him they were
[58:36] going to let him know that he isn't
[58:40] quite what the people thinks he is he
[58:43] might have the crowds and he might have
[58:47] people following him but he knows
[58:49] nothing about the law and he knows
[58:51] nothing about amen we're the wealthy
[58:53] people you see the lower class we would
[58:56] never be able to fit into such kind of
[58:58] events they were never invited into
[58:59] these kind of events the Pharisees were
[59:03] were they they did not believe in
[59:05] mingling with the people they would hurt
[59:07] their reputation the poor and the
[59:09] uneducated were simply left without they
[59:13] were the priest to pray for the people
[59:16] and the people the poor people could not
[59:19] attend in any way this these kinds of
[59:22] functions am man they didn't understand
[59:24] the law anyways the uneducated they knew
[59:27] nothing about the law the uneducated
[59:30] they knew nothing about anything that
[59:32] Jesus would or that the Pharisees would
[59:34] know about so it's best for them to just
[59:36] stay out uh of the way but they invited
[59:41] Jesus for the one
[59:44] purpose and that is to make fun of
[59:48] him they invited Jesus for pure
[59:52] entertainment that's right friends I I
[59:55] don't want to just
[59:57] come I I I I I look at it I I look at
[1:00:00] the at at at our situation today here in
[1:00:04] America and Jesus has been invited to a
[1:00:07] lot of places and there's a lot of
[1:00:08] Pharisees and there's a lot of mega
[1:00:10] churches Mega this Mega that first
[1:00:13] church of so and so this way First
[1:00:14] Church of so and so that way everyone's
[1:00:17] trying to outdo one another everyone is
[1:00:19] trying to put on the biggest dog they're
[1:00:22] trying to do amen and they invite Jesus
[1:00:25] along and they they they they do it for
[1:00:28] one purpose to get the people there and
[1:00:31] and they they they do their best to try
[1:00:36] amen to outdo one another can you say

[1:06:13] Pharisee Amen
[1:06:16] on there the
[1:06:19] master the very creator of heavens and
[1:06:21] earth was sitting right there in their
[1:06:23] midst with dirty feet
[1:06:26] they're the very God Of Heaven who had
[1:06:29] promised amen where God said unto us a a
[1:06:32] virgin a child is born and you shall
[1:06:35] call his name Prince of Peace Mighty God
[1:06:38] Everlasting father he he was sitting
[1:06:42] right there in their midst and those
[1:06:45] Pharisees left
[1:06:47] him with dirty
[1:06:50] feet what were they
[1:06:54] doing well
[1:06:56] they were toasting and man drinking out
[1:06:59] of their goblets and
[1:07:02] eating eating the the finest of the
[1:07:08] meals the the the neighbors could smell
[1:07:11] it oh my when Pharisee would put on one
[1:07:14] of his shin digs all of the poor it
[1:07:16] would draw the poor and and the poor
[1:07:18] would come looking over the fence and
[1:07:21] they weren't allowed to come in and
[1:07:23] touch it would taint them they were
[1:07:25] never allowed to to to mingle but they
[1:07:29] would sit there and just amen see what
[1:07:31] all was going on and looking through the
[1:07:33] windows and seeing the amen the the the
[1:07:38] food and and and just dreaming and and
[1:07:41] daydreaming and and and and and longing
[1:07:44] many of them Longing To to be a part of
[1:07:49] it
[1:07:52] now everything was there everything was
[1:07:54] going everything thing and but there
[1:07:56] with this woman she was one of those
[1:07:59] that were looking in the fence and and
[1:08:02] as she's looking over the fence and
[1:08:05] she's seeing all of these
[1:08:08] things it wasn't the first
[1:08:13] time she had come and seen the occasion
[1:08:17] many of
[1:08:19] times but as she was gazing across that
[1:08:22] fence and she looked in a window
[1:08:25] and she saw Jesus that's right sitting
[1:08:29] there with dirty
[1:08:31] feet when she seen
[1:08:34] him there was something about this man
[1:08:37] and she had been hearing about that
[1:08:39] Galilean prophet and she could hardly
[1:08:42] take her eyes off of him and she
[1:08:44] wondered could this man that's in the
[1:08:46] corner could he be that Prophet could he
[1:08:50] be that Messiah could could could this
[1:08:53] be isn't this Jesus of
[1:08:57] Nazareth isn't this the one that has
[1:09:00] been Healing The Sick isn't this the
[1:09:03] galileon that's been preaching all over
[1:09:06] the
[1:09:08] country and they look there and she's
[1:09:10] seeing Jesus sitting there by
[1:09:13] himself and she could see the dust on
[1:09:16] his clothes and the dirt and Grime on
[1:09:18] his feet and she could see the amen the
[1:09:21] dust in his hair and and she she began
[1:09:25] she begin to wonder why is he sitting
[1:09:29] alone in the
[1:09:31] corner why surely these great
[1:09:36] dignitaries would know who this man is
[1:09:40] how has he been
[1:09:43] overlooked and the Bible says that this
[1:09:46] woman as she begin to look this woman's
[1:09:50] heart begin to
[1:09:51] break and she begin to cry un
[1:09:54] uncontrollably
[1:09:57] she sobbed as she gazed into the window
[1:10:00] and she thought if I could only get to
[1:10:05] him if I could only get to him I would
[1:10:08] wash his
[1:10:09] feet if I could only get to Jesus I I
[1:10:13] would anoint him with
[1:10:16] oil if I could only get to
[1:10:19] Jesus amen and just then she had a
[1:10:22] thought amen and then in shame she
[1:10:24] dismissed missed that thought as
[1:10:26] impossible and not not even a
[1:10:29] possibility but the thought kept gnawing
[1:10:31] at her as she's looking there and
[1:10:33] beholding in
[1:10:34] tears and then suddenly she leaves the
[1:10:38] fits in a hurry and she's going down the
[1:10:40] back road down this road and down this
[1:10:43] alley and through this back road and
[1:10:45] goes down through this other alley and
[1:10:47] up the stairs into the upper room where
[1:10:49] she
[1:10:51] lived and she picked up some money some
[1:10:54] coins gathered them up put them in her
[1:10:57] little Shaw as everything that she had
[1:11:00] and she put it in there and she scurried
[1:11:03] across town to the perfume shop and she
[1:11:05] entered into the shop with her head
[1:11:11] tucked now she wasn't welcome even in
[1:11:13] the perfume shop she she this this woman
[1:11:16] was not a very good woman this woman was
[1:11:19] a she was a
[1:11:21] harlot this woman was not
[1:11:25] even supposed to be in
[1:11:28] society and she bowed her head and
[1:11:31] walked up to the
[1:11:33] counter amen the merchant sneered as she
[1:11:36] walked
[1:11:37] in said what do you
[1:11:40] want your kind is not welcomed here
[1:11:44] and and she said if you just give me the
[1:11:46] very best ointment you
[1:11:50] have the man laughed at her and said you
[1:11:53] don't have the money for the best
[1:11:57] ointment the woman said please
[1:12:01] sir I've got
[1:12:03] enough just let me buy this
[1:12:09] ointment the other customers were
[1:12:11] looking around and she said please
[1:12:17] sir I want the best you have
[1:12:26] I I I don't know as I begin to think
[1:12:28] about this this week and
[1:12:30] I didn't really know how what which way
[1:12:35] to go and I thought I'm just going to
[1:12:38] I'm just going to get up and just tell
[1:12:40] the
[1:12:42] story you see in that Alabaster
[1:12:47] Box was the ointment or it was it was
[1:12:50] the spike nard or they call it in short
[1:12:53] nard and it it it was an uncommon
[1:12:56] perfume that was brought in from India
[1:12:58] and the process of making this fume this
[1:13:01] perfume was lengthy it was a long
[1:13:03] process it was a costly process and they
[1:13:07] kept it in the little Alabaster Box now
[1:13:09] the alabaster box it was a stone that
[1:13:12] was uh uh uh that that they would use
[1:13:15] matters of fact the uh uh uh a lot of
[1:13:18] Solomon's Temple there was a lot of
[1:13:19] alabaster that was in that Temple and
[1:13:22] they would make this Stone and it would
[1:13:24] it it it wouldn't allow the the ointment
[1:13:27] to leak out and it was quite a costly uh
[1:13:31] the alabaster was quite a costly deal as
[1:13:34] well and and and so she she's begging
[1:13:37] please to her I have the money and she
[1:13:41] unwrapped her little apron and she laid
[1:13:43] it out there and he counted the money
[1:13:45] and he's looking at her and and and
[1:13:49] asking what H how in the world would a
[1:13:53] woman of your profession be able to have
[1:13:55] this money
[1:13:57] and she's looking at
[1:14:00] it she's saying I've been saving this
[1:14:03] money up because
[1:14:05] I I don't want this kind of profession
[1:14:08] anymore I want to live in a different
[1:14:10] place I want to be able to I would love
[1:14:13] to have a different P profession I this
[1:14:18] money I've been saving for as long as I
[1:14:21] can
[1:14:23] remember but I want to buy that
[1:14:27] perfume she laid the money down he took
[1:14:31] it he gave her the alabaster box with
[1:14:35] the
[1:14:37] oil Oh Glory to
[1:14:40] gun I wonder
[1:14:43] sometimes I wonder sometimes if we're in
[1:14:46] our self-righteousness whether we want
[1:14:48] to call it self-righteousness or not if
[1:14:51] we want to just look and if we can't
[1:14:54] just look and see
[1:14:57] maybe maybe we've not Fallen hard enough
[1:15:00] maybe we've not had it rough enough
[1:15:02] maybe we've not maybe we've not been
[1:15:05] sinner big enough maybe we've not had
[1:15:09] things enough to
[1:15:12] maybe we don't recognize the beauty of
[1:15:15] the Savior when we do see
[1:15:18] him maybe we don't understand the
[1:15:21] awesomeness of his presence when we come
[1:15:23] into His presence
[1:15:26] maybe we don't
[1:15:27] quite can you say
[1:15:30] Amen but you see this woman as she
[1:15:34] carefully tucked the alabaster box and
[1:15:37] of the precious oil and into her side
[1:15:41] and scurried back across
[1:15:43] town and all the thoughts all the
[1:15:46] thoughts that were in her mind was and
[1:15:48] what if she re what if he rejects me
[1:15:51] what if I get
[1:15:52] CAU what what if one of those priests
[1:15:55] take me and do what the law said to do
[1:15:59] they're all together they're all trying
[1:16:01] to outperform one
[1:16:03] another what what if I die what if they
[1:16:07] Stone
[1:16:11] me but she kept it going and she made it
[1:16:14] past the she made it past the the guards
[1:16:18] and she came behind Jesus and the Bible
[1:16:22] says that she begin to weep
[1:16:25] I I I just want to tell you I don't I I
[1:16:27] don't think God's Jesus is going to
[1:16:29] reject anybody that's got a pen in
[1:16:32] heart when she arrived at Pharisees
[1:16:35] house and there there he sat all alone
[1:16:39] and as Simon was entertaining all of his
[1:16:43] buddies and trying to look big in front
[1:16:46] of
[1:16:47] everyone the intensity of this love of
[1:16:50] this woman to Jesus she come up behind
[1:16:53] him and she didn't have to get a pale of
[1:16:56] water she just knelt down
[1:16:59] and she started weeping and
[1:17:03] crying and she took her own tears and
[1:17:06] she's weeping and she's washing his feet
[1:17:10] getting all of the grime and all of the
[1:17:12] junk off and she would stop and she
[1:17:14] would kiss the
[1:17:17] feet getting the dirt all over her face
[1:17:21] and and she took her hair and she begin
[1:17:25] to wipe the feet and getting the grime
[1:17:28] off and she cried and wept and kissed
[1:17:34] and she she would wipe him with her hair
[1:17:38] and she was washing Jesus
[1:17:41] feet with her very own tears and his
[1:17:46] very own
[1:17:48] hair and her
[1:17:51] sobbing her sobbing must have tracked
[1:17:55] the tension of the
[1:17:58] Pharisees and as they begin to look
[1:18:01] around there she
[1:18:04] is she's break she's broke open the the
[1:18:08] alabaster seal and she's tapping it and
[1:18:12] she pours it all over his
[1:18:15] feet and she continues to kiss and
[1:18:18] continues to wipe and continues to cry
[1:18:21] and continues to to wash his feet
[1:18:26] by this time there was no more toasting
[1:18:28] going on there was no more there was
[1:18:31] there there was there was no more eating
[1:18:33] there was now everyone's attention is
[1:18:36] looking here at this at this at this
[1:18:39] woman and looking at this supposed
[1:18:44] prophet and the Pharisee was thinking in
[1:18:46] himself he said if this man was a
[1:18:48] prophet he would know that this woman is
[1:18:51] a
[1:18:52] sinner he would never let that woman
[1:18:54] tell touch
[1:18:55] him what what is he doing letting a
[1:18:59] harlot touch his
[1:19:01] feet what is he
[1:19:04] doing allowing her to kiss
[1:19:08] him and to
[1:19:10] WIP but as everything gotten cold and
[1:19:14] stone
[1:19:15] silent she
[1:19:22] stopped she looked around
[1:19:28] she said I've been had
[1:19:34] now what is Jesus going to
[1:19:37] say is he going to rebuke me in front of
[1:19:40] everyone is he going to cast me
[1:19:43] aside will he do me like all the other
[1:19:45] men have
[1:19:48] done what about these guys that are
[1:19:50] staring at me in disgust
[1:19:56] I don't belong
[1:19:57] here what if they Stone
[1:20:02] me if you were a harlot in those days
[1:20:05] you've committed adultery you were to be
[1:20:07] taken out in the Public Square and to be
[1:20:09] stoned and
[1:20:11] killed there she stood or she
[1:20:16] knelt that all of the guests were
[1:20:19] looking at
[1:20:22] her Jesus was looking looking at
[1:20:27] her there this woman all the time Stood
[1:20:34] Still she's
[1:20:44] wondering oh glory to
[1:20:51] God as the eyes were looking upon the
[1:20:53] prostitute and and the scorn and the
[1:20:56] disbelief on the face of these men
[1:21:00] and as Simon looked and at this woman
[1:21:04] that was hair all messed up at oil and
[1:21:09] tears and all of the grime of Jesus feet
[1:21:12] all in her hair and oil all over her
[1:21:16] face and the mud and the stench all over
[1:21:20] her she's looking up tears still coming
[1:21:23] down her face
[1:21:27] then Jesus said those
[1:21:31] words
[1:21:35] Simon I want to say something to you
[1:21:43] Simon Simon Says SE on if you want to
[1:21:47] follow me there in Luke 7 and
[1:21:52] 40 Simon I have somewhat to say unto
[1:21:55] thee and he said Master say
[1:21:59] on there was a certain debtor that had
[1:22:02] two debts or there were certain creditor
[1:22:04] who had two debtors one owed 500 Pence
[1:22:06] and the other
[1:22:09] 50 when they had nothing to pay he
[1:22:12] frankly forgave them both
[1:22:14] and tell
[1:22:17] me tell me
[1:22:22] Simon which one loves him the most
[1:22:33] most Simon would say well the one that
[1:22:36] that that owes the
[1:22:39] most he would be the one that would love
[1:22:41] the
[1:22:42] most Jesus says you've said right you've
[1:22:45] said
[1:22:49] well is that Simon
[1:22:55] I've came like you invited me to
[1:23:01] come you didn't wash my
[1:23:05] feet yet this woman ever since she's
[1:23:08] been here has done
[1:23:10] nothing but wash my
[1:23:12] feet with her
[1:23:15] tears he says you've gave me no water
[1:23:17] for my feet but she has washed my feet
[1:23:21] with tears and wiped them with the hairs
[1:23:23] of her head
[1:23:25] thou gavest me no kiss but this woman
[1:23:27] since the time that I came in hath not
[1:23:30] ceased to kiss my
[1:23:33] feet my head with oil thou D not anoint
[1:23:37] but this
[1:23:38] woman hath
[1:23:40] anointed my feet with
[1:23:49] ointment there's a
[1:23:53] reason there's a reason this woman is so
[1:23:57] passionately doing what she's
[1:23:59] doing in giving me love and
[1:24:02] honor I I I I I want to tell you there's
[1:24:06] a
[1:24:07] reason there's a reason why you devote
[1:24:09] yourself so much to Christ you devote
[1:24:12] your so yourself so much to his cause
[1:24:15] and you devote yourself so much to his
[1:24:18] his
[1:24:20] his entertaining him and loving him is
[1:24:23] because you do love him there's
[1:24:25] something within your heart that loves
[1:24:28] him can I get a witness here this
[1:24:33] morning you don't come to the church for
[1:24:35] the
[1:24:36] entertainment thankful for the
[1:24:39] music we're thankful for the songs we're
[1:24:42] thankful for the pre good
[1:24:45] preachers that that's not why we come to
[1:24:47] church we're not coming for
[1:24:51] entertainment we're coming to entertain
[1:24:59] we're not coming because we've got big
[1:25:01] youth
[1:25:05] groups we're not coming because we have
[1:25:07] big
[1:25:10] buildings you're not coming because
[1:25:14] there's so many things that the church
[1:25:17] has to
[1:25:19] offer we're coming because we want to
[1:25:21] see Jesus
[1:25:25] and we want to give
[1:25:27] honor to that one that we
[1:25:31] know has come to this
[1:25:36] generation are you hearing me I I don't
[1:25:39] want to come to church to to receive I
[1:25:42] come to church to give of
[1:25:46] myself to my
[1:25:49] master oh can you say
[1:25:52] Amen it's that one that knows the need
[1:25:55] that knows what God has done and they're
[1:25:57] so thankful for what God has done that
[1:26:00] they're going to give of themselves over
[1:26:02] they're going to throw themselves at his
[1:26:04] feet and don't matter what other people
[1:26:06] think or what other people say or what
[1:26:07] other people do there's one thing they
[1:26:10] have in their mind they want to get to
[1:26:13] Jesus and they want to give him what he
[1:26:16] deserves because he is worthy of it not
[1:26:20] worried about this Pharisees Simon not
[1:26:23] worrying about his buddies not worried
[1:26:25] about anything else there's only one
[1:26:27] thing that we have in our mind and our
[1:26:29] heart and that is to give him the honor
[1:26:33] and the glory that he
[1:26:37] deserves because Jesus is not just
[1:26:39] setting in a corner with dirty feet
[1:26:41] Jesus has been kicked out of the
[1:26:45] house until Jesus is no longer
[1:26:48] even a part of it they want him they
[1:26:51] sing to him they do all of this
[1:26:56] but they're ashamed of who he
[1:27:00] is they've got their own Prestige
[1:27:02] they've got their own way they got and
[1:27:05] they have no
[1:27:06] room for
[1:27:10] Jesus he's talking to
[1:27:15] Simon I love
[1:27:17] this and then when
[1:27:20] he continues to talk to
[1:27:23] Simon he said
[1:27:25] Simon and the Bible
[1:27:30] says he turned to the
[1:27:33] woman I say unto
[1:27:36] thee her
[1:27:41] sins her sins which are
[1:27:47] many are
[1:27:52] forgiven could you imagine
[1:27:56] if you were that
[1:27:59] prostitute was sitting
[1:28:02] there at the feet of
[1:28:08] Jesus thy sins her sins talking to the
[1:28:12] Pharisee
[1:28:14] Simon her
[1:28:18] sins which are
[1:28:20] many are forgiven her
[1:28:28] Simon if you could recognize who I am
[1:28:31] you could have had it Simon if you only
[1:28:34] knew what I'm here to
[1:28:37] do you could be forgiven of your
[1:28:43] self-righteousness but you've got your
[1:28:44] own little thing going on between you
[1:28:47] and
[1:28:49] God and you can't see what I have
[1:28:55] well praise the
[1:28:58] Lord times hasn't changed much there's
[1:29:00] still a lot of Pharisees around the
[1:29:05] country but this little woman what did
[1:29:07] Jesus
[1:29:09] say for she has loved
[1:29:14] much if you were to read that she said
[1:29:17] it says wherefore I say unto thee her
[1:29:19] sins which are many are
[1:29:22] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[1:29:26] little Is Forgiven the same loveth
[1:29:29] little and then he turned to
[1:29:33] her and he looked at this little
[1:29:36] lady she wasn't even a lady this little
[1:29:39] woman and
[1:29:40] said thy
[1:29:43] sins are
[1:29:48] forgiven as
[1:29:50] we think along these lines here this
[1:29:53] morning
[1:29:59] that song that Sister Amy Sung you don't
[1:30:01] know the cost of the
[1:30:04] oil in my Alabaster
[1:30:09] Box you don't know the cost of the
[1:30:13] praise if you were there when Jesus
[1:30:15] found
[1:30:17] me you did not feel what I felt when he
[1:30:20] put his loving arms around me
[1:30:24] you don't you don't know what it
[1:30:27] feels but I do know what it
[1:30:32] feels I love
[1:30:34] him I love him so
[1:30:39] much this
[1:30:44] morning as we sit
[1:30:47] here we're not a rich church we
[1:30:50] have don't have much to
[1:30:55] I brag about probably don't have a lot
[1:30:57] of money in our accounts
[1:30:59] and but that's okay because that's not
[1:31:02] what God is looking
[1:31:04] for he's looking for someone that can
[1:31:06] recognize him for who he
[1:31:09] is for what he
[1:31:13] is I I I want I I
[1:31:18] want I want this
[1:31:22] church I I I I I want this church to be
[1:31:26] a church full
[1:31:28] of those little prostitutes and Mary
[1:31:31] magdalin and the poor and I I I I don't
[1:31:37] I don't mind that's where Jesus felt at
[1:31:40] home I don't want to be the high
[1:31:43] class if the Lord wants to fill our
[1:31:46] church that that's fine I don't ask for
[1:31:49] rich people all I ask for is people who
[1:31:52] can recognize his presence and to love
[1:31:56] him all I want is is to be a part of
[1:32:00] somebody
[1:32:03] that that can feel that touch that Jesus
[1:32:07] feels and that can be his arms and it
[1:32:12] can be his feet and but can you say
[1:32:16] Amen it can be that can be that that God
[1:32:19] has called us to
[1:32:22] be that can re
[1:32:28] out but praise the
[1:32:32] Lord because that's what Christ has come
[1:32:35] he's he's not come for the he's not come
[1:32:39] for those who have the life put
[1:32:42] together he's come for those who can
[1:32:45] recognize who he
[1:32:48] is as we prepare to close this morning
[1:32:54] have you recognized
[1:32:58] him is church or do you walk with him or
[1:33:02] is Christianity just a church deal for
[1:33:07] you how long has it been since you've
[1:33:09] entertained him in your
[1:33:11] home how long has it been since you've
[1:33:13] entertained him in your
[1:33:21] heart they couldn't recognize him
[1:33:25] because he was an
[1:33:28] illegitimate born self-proclaimed
[1:33:32] Prophet didn't come the way of the
[1:33:34] priest didn't come the
[1:33:38] lineage of
[1:33:40] Aaron they could go all the way back
[1:33:43] they couldn't accept
[1:33:45] him but I wonder in this generation and
[1:33:48] this bride coming of Jesus
[1:33:51] Christ if we can re recognize that the
[1:33:54] only God that this people will ever see
[1:33:56] this generation will ever see is in
[1:34:01] you I
[1:34:03] wonder I wonder if it can really if it's
[1:34:06] really hitting our
[1:34:08] hearts that God is still in a body here
[1:34:13] on the
[1:34:16] earth he's in human beings he's in men
[1:34:19] and women boys and girls
[1:34:24] he's touching through your hands he's
[1:34:28] reaching through your body he's giving
[1:34:31] through
[1:34:34] you not a virgin born
[1:34:40] son but a
[1:34:42] harlot who has found Grace with
[1:34:46] God and has changed her around until the
[1:34:51] Harlot becomes a lady
[1:34:56] and now
[1:34:58] God is touching
[1:35:06] people the one who knows what it is to
[1:35:10] feel pain who knows what it is to hurt
[1:35:15] who knows what it is to cry who knows
[1:35:19] what it is not to have a daddy not to
[1:35:23] have a mom who knows what it is not to
[1:35:26] have a husband or not to have a wife or
[1:35:28] not to have a daddy or not to have a son
[1:35:31] someone who can feel the pain for
[1:35:33] somebody else somebody that can reach
[1:35:36] out into that Supernatural realm and
[1:35:39] bring God down
[1:35:46] physically through
[1:35:49] you it can only come
[1:35:54] through a
[1:35:56] Mary her she didn't call her name
[1:36:01] Mary there's two or three different
[1:36:04] accounts given
[1:36:06] and of women washing jesus' feet this is
[1:36:08] a separate account it seems in scripture
[1:36:14] from from the other Mary but this
[1:36:22] woman because she loved
[1:36:26] him it wasn't
[1:36:30] just her giving of herself to
[1:36:33] him she' done all she could do that's
[1:36:36] all she could
[1:36:38] do they they
[1:36:41] said history says that the money would
[1:36:45] have been a year
[1:36:50] salary for the average person
[1:36:55] and she had saved
[1:36:57] this saved this for year after year
[1:37:01] after
