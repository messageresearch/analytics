Well, we sure believe that here this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. We're relying on the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; We're not relying on any man's works, but we're relying on the grace of God. &gt;&gt; We're just so thankful for the opportunity to be here for the church and brother Wendle for inviting us to be up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to forgive me. I do get nervous up here when I'm preaching to a bunch of preachers. And you know, we'll just have to do the best we can and you guys can go ahead and preach part two. All right. &gt;&gt; But we're excited to be here. We're closing an old year and we're starting a new year. And &gt;&gt; but you know what? &gt;&gt; We don't have to start over with the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, we've come through battles, &gt;&gt; but we can keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; We don't have to start over our relationship in 2026 with the Lord, &gt;&gt; but we can continue on the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just so thankful for that. If you would, let's just dive into the scriptures here. And we'd like to take a a little thought here from Acts chapter 3. We'll take a little scripture here and and maybe a little story from the from David. But if I could, this may be an odd text for this scripture in this time. But this is really what the Lord had put on my heart for this service. &gt;&gt; And if I could title it is, where is the Lord's anointing? &gt;&gt; Okay. Where is the Lord's anointing? &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 3, we'll start with verse one. It says, "Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour, and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple, who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an alms." And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said, "Look on us." And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. That's something key there. He was he was expecting to receive something of them. &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. And immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God. And all the people that saw him walking and praising God. Let's just bow our heads. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just come before you yet once more. Father, Lord, we're thankful for this time in this little assembly and believers that have gathered themselves together. Lord, there's many things that we could do tonight, but Father, we just want to set ourselves aside for your service tonight. Father, we just ask that you would just be with each and every one. Lord, we're just asking that you would just take complete control of this service. That you would just work in a supernatural way. Each one of us have needs. Father, you know what they are. We just ask that you would be with them. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. So again, if I could uh take a a small thought, it's a simple thought here on where is the Lord's anointing. And one thing I love about this message, I I believe this message. I believe that brother Brandham was the uh prophet to our age. And you know, I'm just glad I don't have to come up with any of my own new doctrines. I don't have to come up something to preach on on my own. But I can just reinforce the message of this hour. I can reinforce what God has already sent to the church for this day. And if I repeat what he's saying, and I just bring to you uh uh by remembrance what the Lord has already said, then we ought to be doing all right. But if I could just bring to you what God has already preached to us for our age, then we know that we're going to be on the right track. &gt;&gt; But what we're looking for is we're not looking for an anointing of another day, but what we're looking for is where is God's anointing right now. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's really easy for us to look back in time and to see other maybe uh Bible characters or people from the past and we can see that the Lord had anointed their lives or we could see that God had anointed a certain situation to happen in the past. But sometimes we fail to understand where is God's anointing right now. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we can see how the anointing was on David &gt;&gt; and Goliath &gt;&gt; in that situation and how God anointed David to overcome that situation in that age. &gt;&gt; We can see how the Lord anointed uh uh Moses. We can see how the Lord anointed Christ. We can see how he anointed John the Baptist. We can see how he had anointed uh uh brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But can we see the anointing in our lives? Come on, preacher. &gt;&gt; So, that's what I'd like to preach on is where is the Lord's anointing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; To anoint means to apply an oil as part of a religious ceremony if you're praying for the sick or whatnot. But it also means to anoint means to choose by divine election. &gt;&gt; Now, this is just not a choosing of numbers or a lottery, but this is a choosing &gt;&gt; by divine election. Right. &gt;&gt; Well, I think if we could really just focus on that for a minute, that ought to make a Methodist shout. Because before the beginning, God had created you to be one of his. &gt;&gt; You're not one of the devils, but you are one of his. And he has elected you by a divine election, not a happen sense or or something that you just happen to walk into, but this is a divine election that you have been hand selected by the King of Kings, by the Lord of Lords. Amen. &gt;&gt; He already knew your past before the beginning. &gt;&gt; And your future is greater than your past. &gt;&gt; And God has elected you for something. &gt;&gt; Everyone is under &gt;&gt; an anointing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We can look back and see what happened even this past year that prophecies had been fulfilled that there would be a pope from the United States. We knew it was coming &gt;&gt; by prophecy. Nobody expected it to happen in 2025, but it happened. &gt;&gt; There is an anointing on the religious realm. &gt;&gt; There's an anointing on the world. Satan has a great anointing on the world in this age to snatch the hearts of young people and old people alike. &gt;&gt; It's not just the young people that struggle, &gt;&gt; but I'm sure the pastors here can can tell you that the old people struggle, too. Right? &gt;&gt; And what usually is a young person's battle has now become old people's battles as well. &gt;&gt; Suicidal thoughts and whatever you may, you know, have to battle as a young person, the old people are also battling &gt;&gt; like never before because there's an anointing &gt;&gt; from Satan on this age. &gt;&gt; But if there's an anointing on this age from Satan, then there must be a true anointing. &gt;&gt; That's good. Yes. &gt;&gt; Luke says in chapter 21 28, he says, "And when you see these things begin to come to pass, then look up. Lift up your heads for your redemption drawth nigh." &gt;&gt; I think we could take some safety in that this evening &gt;&gt; that when we begin to see all of these things, we begin to see what was preached about in the 40s, in the 50s, in the 60s become come to pass in our age, &gt;&gt; then we ought to be able to walk in &gt;&gt; shity. &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to stand firm. We ought to be able to recognize who we are and where the Lord's anointing is resting in this age. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question. Did the ANOINTING OF THE HOLY Spirit die with brother Brandon? &gt;&gt; Is it buried somewhere in Indiana, Kentucky, or somewhere over in Arizona? No. The Lord's anointing has continued on. The Lord's anointing is the Holy Spirit, and it's not buried somewhere in the ground 6 feet deep. But this Lord's anointing is on his people tonight. And it has anointed us to overcome. &gt;&gt; The Lord's anointing has never anointed one believer to defeat. &gt;&gt; But the Lord's anointing is an anointing to overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a story of the young eaglet. They get snatched out of the eagle's nest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was an egg. They put it in the in the chicken's nest. You remember the story, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It gets hatched in the wrong location. The environment was right. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; And so it hatched. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But as it began to grow, it just kept looking around and &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; kept going, something has an uncertain sound. &gt;&gt; I hear this cluck cluck cluck. This a days of miracles has passed. &gt;&gt; Well, the anointing was just for brother Brando. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Something just didn't sit right with that little &gt;&gt; leaf. &gt;&gt; You know, all the all the chickens were fine. &gt;&gt; They liked that kind of food. &gt;&gt; They like scratching around in the dirt and pecking here and pecking there and eating a little worm here and a little worm there. But there was something more for an eagle. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; There was something inside of that eagle that was calling for a little bit more. &gt;&gt; It wasn't an earthbound bird. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But it was a heavenly bird. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you've got something in your heart, a deep that's calling out to the deep, then that means that there must be a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; So if you want to have more of God in your life, Brother Brandham said, then there must be more of God to have in your life. &gt;&gt; If there's a desire in you to overcome tonight, then there must be an overcoming for you to have. &gt;&gt; And that overcoming is found in the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is for you. Oh, I know how the devil likes to come and he likes to say, "Oh, the Holy Spirit may be for the pastor. The Holy Spirit may be for the preacher. The Holy Spirit may be for the song leader. It may be FOR THE MUSICIANS, BUT IT AIN'T FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I'm too young or I'm too old or I've got a pastor. I've done this or I've done that or I've got time. &gt;&gt; This anointing is for you tonight. We don't have to wait for the new year. We don't have to wait for it to hit 1200. But we can take our position right now. Submit to the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Reach out and grab your promise tonight. &gt;&gt; It's not an emotional workup. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to preach to you some motivational uh uh uh speech. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to preach to you a message that is motivational. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you the scriptures THAT ARE BEING FULFILLED BEFORE OUR VERY EYES to where we can see where we're standing. THAT PROPHECY IS BEING FULFILLED. WE'RE FOLLOWING something that's true. And the truth shall set you free. &gt;&gt; Shall set you free. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've all gone through struggles this year. Can we all say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But the truth shall set you free. You know, so many times I see in in message churches how sometimes we bind ourselves up in our mind &gt;&gt; and we allow Satan to have his way in our lives because we've bound ourselves in our mind. &gt;&gt; Where we don't feel free. We still show up. We still sit in a pew, &gt;&gt; but we're not free like we should be. &gt;&gt; But this truth shall set you free. &gt;&gt; Preach it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says says, "I tell you, just like that little eagle recognize that voice, &gt;&gt; so does a real born again Christian recognize the voice of God speaking through the word. &gt;&gt; When they see it anointed &gt;&gt; and vindicated &gt;&gt; when they see it anointed and vindicated, &gt;&gt; that's it." &gt;&gt; He looked up there. He didn't see this old hand cluck. Cluck around here. join us and go over there, do this, do that, go uh to do this and that. He saw being like he wanted to be sailing in the air, screaming free up in the heights, &gt;&gt; above all the vultures and things of the earth. Hallelujah. He wanted to be like that because that's what he was. &gt;&gt; You see the difference between an eagle and a vultures? They're very two different birds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sure. &gt;&gt; The vultures will come down, they'll eat some dead &gt;&gt; deer on the side of the road. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know, when they want to have a heavenly experience, they got to flap their wings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they got to flap. And they got to flap. And they got to flap and flap and flap and flap. And they got to get up into the air by some some emotional workup. &gt;&gt; They got to get themselves a heavenly experience by something that they can work up. &gt;&gt; But the difference between a vulture and an eagle is the eagle sitting over in that pine tree, Brother Brandham said. He kept listening to that little squirrel go chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter. And one day he got sick of it. &gt;&gt; One of these days we got to get sick of listening to the devil in our lives saying that you're not good enough &gt;&gt; or your complex is going to keep you down. &gt;&gt; There are way too many message believers living in complex. &gt;&gt; We have been called to something larger than that. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO SOMETHING BIGGER than that. WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO overcome your complex in your life. &gt;&gt; But I'm not good enough. No, you are not. &gt;&gt; But I know one that is. &gt;&gt; And we're not relying on our experience. We're relying on Jesus Christ and his word. And so he has overcome. &gt;&gt; That's good preaching. &gt;&gt; Trying not to get ahead of myself. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. He says, "And a man that is born of God, a son of God, has to have the nature of God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Boy, we could preach a sermon on that. &gt;&gt; He has to be like God. &gt;&gt; He honors God. He's a part of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Well, that's heavy. &gt;&gt; That's good. And in this last days of this bride taking form, just exactly the same power that he was in the beginning has come up through these organizations and so forth and come out for a bride. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So the same thing that Christ did back then, &gt;&gt; the bride is going to do now. &gt;&gt; So now we're looking at Acts three. &gt;&gt; Here comes the disciples to church &gt;&gt; and they see a man that is lame from birth &gt;&gt; and he comes expecting to receive something from them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many times we come to church and you know it just becomes a tradition to us. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in in in in the unveiling of Christ he said we have been veiled by traditions. Okay. &gt;&gt; So many of these churches, Methodists or Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, whatever it may be, they've been veiled by traditions and it has blinded them to seeing the freedom in the word. &gt;&gt; So, we have to be careful now &gt;&gt; as message believers not to get caught up into tradition that we just come to church on Sunday because that's what we do. We just show up and we sit at the same place every day. We put a dollar in the plate when it comes around. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we listen to the preacher for about an hour. If he preaches a little bit more, then we get upset. You know, we got to get in the church. WE'RE GETTING BOUND UP BY TRADITION. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we need to break up a little tradition. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we need to do a little bit different. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES I THINK IT WOULDN'T hurt if we raised our hand. Sometimes I don't think it WOULD HURT IF WE RAISED OUR OTHER HAND. Sometimes I don't think that it would hurt if we marched around the church a little bit. I'm not talking about uh on something run out of the uh &gt;&gt; church order. &gt;&gt; We have church order. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to get a little Pentecostal experience &gt;&gt; so you can experience some of that freedom. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be bound down by traditions. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's not what you've been called to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. in the anointed ones of the end time. Brother Brandham says, "Now you called them vultures." You say, "Brother Brandon, that's right. But remember, a vulture is just a bird. He's anointed to fly also. &gt;&gt; These two spirits will be so close it'll deceive the elected. A vulture is a big as an eagle. He can fly like that eagle. &gt;&gt; He's anointed to fly or to preach or to prophesy." Notice the same as an eagle. &gt;&gt; It might be hard to tell the difference of them sitting in a church building. &gt;&gt; But he can't follow the eagle in the heights. &gt;&gt; No. No. If he tries to follow that eagle, his follyies will be made manifest. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the personal revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. How many times have we seen message preachers? &gt;&gt; Vultures. &gt;&gt; If brother Brandham called them vultures, I'm going to call them vultures. &gt;&gt; If they don't have the PERSONAL REVELATION OF JESUS Christ and how he has been manifested in this age, &gt;&gt; the word of God living in this age, then they are vultures. They can't follow us to the heights. So the scripture says, don't be surprised when they go out of from us because they were never of us. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But here they are. PASTORS AND PREACHERS IN MESSAGE CHURCHES, VULTURES. &gt;&gt; I know that's hard. This is brother Windle's church, but you can clean up the mess later. WE DON'T WANT TO BE VULTURES. &gt;&gt; WE want to be eagles. &gt;&gt; We want to follow Christ into the heights. &gt;&gt; And you know what that little eagle did? It was sitting up there in that tree. And it didn't have to get a Pentecostal workup to soar into the heights. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But it knew that the power &gt;&gt; that made him rise &gt;&gt; is already &gt;&gt; in the skies. &gt;&gt; It's nothing that you can do. &gt;&gt; It's not how good I can live. If it was up to me on how good I could live, if I would go into rapture or not, brother, I'm sorry to admit I wouldn't make it. &gt;&gt; And neither would you. And neither would anybody else. But we're relying &gt;&gt; on the anointing of the Holy Spirit in our age. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So sometimes we just need to set our wings &gt;&gt; to the winds of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And just reach higher and higher &gt;&gt; and higher &gt;&gt; and higher. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Because if if there's more of God desiring in your heart, then there's got to be more of God to to respond. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're in your heart, you need healing &gt;&gt; and you want healing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said if there's a deep calling, there's got to be a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord for our age. &gt;&gt; That settles it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm just hillbilly enough to believe it. &gt;&gt; That if God said it, he vindicated it through a prophet, then I'll believe it. It'll happen. &gt;&gt; It's not my words. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's God's words. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The creator of heavens and earth is so interested in you. He sent a prophet down. &gt;&gt; Well, why did he have to uh come down and tell me through a prophet? Why couldn't he tell him me himself? I've thought the same thing. &gt;&gt; Well, without the message, we might not understand it. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said he he tried to speak to the people one time &gt;&gt; and the people got scared and said, "No, no, speak through Moses." So God told him, "From now on, I'm going to speak through the prophets." &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's why we needed brother &gt;&gt; brain. &gt;&gt; Because that is God explaining through a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I know this is simple tonight. I'm not I'm not looking to preach any new doctrines tonight, but what I'm trying to get you to realize is God's anointing is in his word. &gt;&gt; God's anointing. We need to eat the book. And if you are what you eat and you eat the word and you are the word, then your anointing &gt;&gt; is the Holy Ghost living inside of you, then when you say let it be so, then it's just like Jesus Christ saying, "Let it be so." Because we are praying in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know how an ambassador works. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They go to a foreign country and they have the entire power of the United States or whatever country it is that they're representing behind them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when they say in the name of the United States, it doesn't matter their past. &gt;&gt; But all the power OF THE UNITED STATES IS BEHIND THEM &gt;&gt; to back up what they say, brother. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter my past. LOOK, KOBE, IT DOESN'T MATTER YOUR PAST. BUT WHATEVER YOU SAY IN the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; there's no other name, &gt;&gt; but in the name of Jesus Christ, let it be so. &gt;&gt; It's done. It's finished. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK IT UP. You don't have to pray it up. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, let it be so and it shall be done. &gt;&gt; That's thus sayeth the Lord for our age. &gt;&gt; Came through a vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; just like the Bible said it would be [Music] &gt;&gt; but people can't follow us up there. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I've got lots of friends that I grew up with in a message church out in the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; They couldn't catch it. &gt;&gt; They couldn't catch it. &gt;&gt; But what's interesting is Brother Brandham's preaching this and after church, one brother says, "Oh, I can't believe he called us vultures." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But the other brother said, "What? You, brother, didn't call us vultures." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He called us eagles. &gt;&gt; There was an anointing on each of those brothers. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A GOOD anointing on one brother and there was a bad anointing on the other. There was a vulture anointing on one and there was an eagle anointing on the other one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's harvest time. &gt;&gt; It is. Come on. &gt;&gt; Who you are will be made manifest. We're getting too close to the end. That's why we're seeing people fall away left and right. &gt;&gt; You're either going to be a wheat or you're going to be a weed, &gt;&gt; but you will be exposed. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; You know, I was listening to and I guess I'll just uh I'll just preach on this. I was listening to the mighty God unveiled. &gt;&gt; And he's talking about how God in this last age has been unveiled to the believer. &gt;&gt; What a powerful message. I mean, I think I think we would we could go listen to that message every day and get something new. &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled to his believers. &gt;&gt; He's not unveiled to everybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he's unveiled to the believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the curtain had to be rent at Calvary. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; That's why Moses had to wear a veil. &gt;&gt; Right. Come on. &gt;&gt; There's so many types, brother, that we could take from here. But what the what what the point is is God has unveiled himself for the believer. If you see this message, consider yourself blessed. CONSIDER YOURSELF A BLESSED PEOPLE THAT THIS PROMISE IS FOR YOU. SO THAT ALONE should give you the faith enough to reach out and grab your promise tonight &gt;&gt; because you can see this &gt;&gt; promise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it's for you. &gt;&gt; It's not for the person sitting next to you. &gt;&gt; Everybody say me. &gt;&gt; This is for me. &gt;&gt; It's for me, too. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. If I could tell you a little story about little Bible character I'm sure you've heard of is David. &gt;&gt; We look back and see how he was anointed, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was an anointed young man. And boy, he uh he could play the harp. I'm sure he was like brother Kobe. He could play the piano, play the organ, play the &gt;&gt; what you name it, he could play it. &gt;&gt; He had an anointing on him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He had an anointing on him that was so great it could disperse the anointing of fear. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Because Saul was anointed king. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He was an anointed man for the job. &gt;&gt; But then he got away from the word thinking he could do better. And so the prophet came to him and he said, "God's repented of making you king &gt;&gt; because you didn't stay with the word." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We got to stick with the word. We got to stick with the message. &gt;&gt; We got to stick with the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he thought he knew better. So he kept uh what was it? The Amalachites. He kept the king and some of the best cattle and the sheep and he was going to have a sacrifice. The prophet came to him and he said, "Obedience is better than sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need to hear that as a churches. Obedience is better than sacrifice. Brother Wendle, if they're listening to your your uh your uh uh consultations, sometimes they need to know obedience is better than sacrifice. You know, &gt;&gt; but I tithe to the church and I do this and I do that. Obedience is better than sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Now, that one was free. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So then the Lord says, "I'm going to find one that's made after my own heart." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he anoints David. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to not notice that when David was anointed king, &gt;&gt; he all of his trials didn't just go away. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But David is now anointed king and then a a lion comes up against his herd. &gt;&gt; Okay? He's anointed king and then a bear comes up against his herd. He goes through struggles. He goes through dangerous situations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we read through scriptures and we go, David, you know, overcame a lion and a bear through, you know, the power of the Holy Spirit and we just keep moving on. &gt;&gt; No, literally a lion and a bear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And a slingshot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And a little ruddy. I'm five. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever. I am 10. He was 53. I think brother Bram said 56. Somewhere in there about this high. &gt;&gt; Going up against a bear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And a lion &gt;&gt; with a little slingshot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Real battles. I'm talking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Dangerous situations. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What situation do you have? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But David had to go through these things for a very specific reason. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. It was to give him experience &gt;&gt; that he could trust the Lord in all situations &gt;&gt; because those battles were preparing him for something. &gt;&gt; The things he was going through back then was preparing him for a battle when he faced Goliath. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; maybe you're facing a Goliath now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe you've been through financial troubles or what whatever the case may be in your life. Maybe you're facing a Goliath, but you can look back at all the struggles that you've had to go through and you can say, "The Lord was preparing me for tonight. &gt;&gt; The Lord was preparing me throughout all the years of my life to be able to stand here in church tonight on a watch night service and say, "Devil, I've had enough. &gt;&gt; You've came out and you've boasted one too many times. You've come out day after day after day and said, "I am not good enough." But that boast finally fell, brother Bram said, on the wrong ears &gt;&gt; because he was preaching it to Saul that had been anointed at one time. &gt;&gt; But when that boast fell on true &gt;&gt; anointed ears, &gt;&gt; where the Holy Spirit was working. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a real anointing. I'm talking about a real experience. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about an emotional Pentecostal workup. I'm not talking about just screaming and shouting, but I'm talking about the stimulation of revelation. When it strikes your heart, it makes you dance a little bit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It makes you firm. &gt;&gt; It makes you know where you stand. &gt;&gt; That it doesn't matter if mama and daddy go astray. It doesn't matter if the pastor goes astray. It doesn't matter if the deacons go astray. You know where you stand because you've had an experience. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You've got an anointing on your life that is a higher calling. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the Israelites were not a, how would I want to say this? They weren't cowardice. &gt;&gt; They were where they were supposed to be, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; There was a battle called and the children of Israel dressed themselves up. &gt;&gt; They had their armor on. They were at the field of battle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were camped there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and the the the enemy is right across the valley. &gt;&gt; They were where they were supposed to be scripturally. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But then the devil would come out and say, "I'm bigger than you." &gt;&gt; One of you come out and face me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have church struggles like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where the church is where it's supposed to be. All right. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here in your suit and tie or the women's got their long dresses on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're sitting there and the the devil's coming up and saying, &gt;&gt; "I'm bigger than you." &gt;&gt; And day after day after day, we listen to the boast of the enemy when he says, "I'm bigger than you. You'll never overcome pornography. You'll never overcome lustful. You'll never overcome this or that or whatever the case may be." and you listen to him day after day after day. But when those those false boasts come on anointed ears, &gt;&gt; then there is something that is different. &gt;&gt; There's got to be somebody that rises up and say, "What?" &gt;&gt; What is this uncircumcised Philistine saying to the army of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you see the thing that was happening with the Israelites is they were sitting there waiting for a champion. &gt;&gt; They sat there waiting and waiting and waiting, waiting for the champion to arise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe it's the pastor's job. Well, maybe it's the deacon's job. Well, maybe it's the song leader's job. A champion must arise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But one that was anointed for the job. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling a little religious. &gt;&gt; One that was anointed for the job &gt;&gt; TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JOB. &gt;&gt; Cuz you see, with anointing comes responsibility. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So many times we want the anointing of Jesus Christ and none of the responsibility that comes with it. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; We want to be prayer warriors, but we don't want anything to to happen in our life where we need to pray. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We want to be the one that everybody comes to and consults with us, but we don't want the life experience. &gt;&gt; If I could put it this way, we want to go into the promised land, but we're afraid of the beast stinging us and and the cow kicking us. &gt;&gt; We want to be in the land of flowing with milk and honey, but we don't want to go through the trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. I don't think that David thought that he was anointed to be king when he came up against the bear. When he came up against the line, we he came up against Goliath. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He probably wasn't feeling a Pentecostal, woo, I'm anointed for this job, &gt;&gt; but it was a trial that he had to go through and he was anointed for the job. &gt;&gt; I don't think that our Lord and and Savior Jesus Christ was feeling anointed, but he was carrying the cross up Calvary. &gt;&gt; He probably wasn't feeling it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but he was anointed for the job &gt;&gt; because someone had to take responsibility. &gt;&gt; He had an anointing on his life and he had to take responsibility. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's an anointing on your life to be a father, a good, godly father. &gt;&gt; There's a responsibility to be taken. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the oldest in the family. There's a responsibility that comes with that. There's an anointing on your life by the Holy Spirit and you have to take responsibility for what that anointing is. &gt;&gt; I know this is odd for a year end service, but this is just what the Lord put on my heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the sword of the Lord will prevail. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. 1st Samuel 17 and 47 David yells out and says, "And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword or spear, for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into my hands." &gt;&gt; That was the key of the battle right there. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. David didn't say, "I've got all this experience, so I can overcome you." &gt;&gt; What did he say? &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He said, "The battle is the Lord's." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I will take you into my hands. &gt;&gt; He said, "And he will give you into our hands." &gt;&gt; So if this is not any longer David's battle &gt;&gt; and now this is the Lord's battle, Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then boy, you can be a whole lot more confident &gt;&gt; because now this is no longer David versus Goliath, but now this is the LORD VERSUS SOME UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE. &gt;&gt; I think we need to change our perception sometimes of how we look at the devil. &gt;&gt; And we need to quit looking at him like this big great Goliath of a guy &gt;&gt; that can just have his way in any way he wants to treat us. We just have to cower down and say, "Oh, the devil's been hard to me this week. Oh, the devil told me this and the devil told me that and this is happening to my family and I can't control nothing and &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; but we need to view this as this is our God versus some insignificant. You know how big Goliath is when you look at a globe? &gt;&gt; I can't even see Goliath when I look at a globe. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; that's how big your problem is in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; They're insignificant. &gt;&gt; So, this isn't your battle, &gt;&gt; but this is the Lord's battle. And guess what? He doesn't want to work his own hands. He wants to work through your hands. &gt;&gt; He wants to work through your voice because you have been anointed for the job. &gt;&gt; He has selected you through a divine selection for that particular job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Parker, I couldn't face your battles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have to face your battle. He has anointed you to do your job. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's anointed me to do my job. &gt;&gt; We can't be jealous of each other's gifts. We can't be jealous of people's offices. WE HAVE TO DO OUR JOB. &gt;&gt; We're working as a team. &gt;&gt; So, David had a revelation. The battle is the Lord's and he is just using our vessel to work through. That's how David could be fearless. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then we skip down to verse 50. And you know what? The same uh vessel that the devil thought he would use to overcome you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was the same vessel &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that David overcame by. &gt;&gt; The very sword that Goliath came out day after day after day saying, "I will slay you with this sword. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; I will slay you with this sword and you'll all be my slaves. That same sword is the sword that cut off Goliath's head. &gt;&gt; David put revelation into action and overcame him and then chopped off his head with the very thing &gt;&gt; that he said he was going to overcome him with. &gt;&gt; Your testimony &gt;&gt; can cut the devil's head off. You could be the skin on the bottom of the feet of the Lord Jesus body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know, the hand is not ordained to stomp on the devil. &gt;&gt; Right, brother? &gt;&gt; The job of the skin on the bottom of the feet. &gt;&gt; Is to stomp &gt;&gt; on the head &gt;&gt; of the devil. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I feel like that where I'm just the lowest Christian. I don't deserve anything. And sometimes I wonder if I'm even Christian or not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what? If I'm the skin on the bottom of my feet, &gt;&gt; then my job is to rise up and quit, as brother Forny would say, of the wowsy wowsy woos. &gt;&gt; To shake all that off, &gt;&gt; to shake it off and stomp on the head of the devil. &gt;&gt; Because somebody has to start taking responsibility and stand up and say, "I'll do it." &gt;&gt; If somebody needs prayer, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; If something needs to happen in the church, I'll do it. Come on. &gt;&gt; If somebody needs to study a little bit more, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to start taking responsibility. &gt;&gt; Because as soon as David overcame, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; All those Israelites were ready. &gt;&gt; They were ready to follow their champion. &gt;&gt; What did brother Brandham say? He said in in why little Bethlehem, he says, "We didn't conquer." He said, "It's already conquered." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We never conquered death. Amen. &gt;&gt; He conquered death for us. &gt;&gt; He is our David in this day. &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't have to go fight Goliath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ already fought Goliath. We've got to vindicate the prophet's word for this. &gt;&gt; He already fought Goliath for our day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have at it cancer. &gt;&gt; Have at it sickness. &gt;&gt; Have at it financial problems. My God is greater. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My God is greater than any problem that you could face. &gt;&gt; And I've got confidence in him. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; First John 2:20 says, "But you have an anointing from the Holy One." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:27 says, "But the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's scripture. So what I'm preaching to you tonight is not my own idea. &gt;&gt; This is God's word for us in this age. &gt;&gt; John 9:6 says, "When he had spoken this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay." So when the anointing reached his eyes, he could see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the type of anointing that we're looking for in this age. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for some other anointing, but we're looking for the Holy Ghost anointing, &gt;&gt; to anoint our eyes that we might be able to see. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Do we understand everything brother Brandon preached? &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't. But if you keep resting in that anointing, &gt;&gt; he'll show you. &gt;&gt; He'll show you. &gt;&gt; Mark 16:15 says, &gt;&gt; "And he said unto them, go you into all the world and preach the gospel unto every creature." &gt;&gt; That's the anointing that we have. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; You know, I think message churches ought to be a whole lot bigger. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We know there's going to be three kinds of believers in every congregation. Brother Brandham told us that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you know, as I'm going to preach it myself, I don't do enough outreach. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I think as message believers, we get an elitist mentality sometimes &gt;&gt; and we look down on everybody else and we're not sharing the gospel like we should. &gt;&gt; We're not sharing the message like WE SHOULD. &gt;&gt; THE SEVEN seals are open. Hello. &gt;&gt; Do we know what that means? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we could share this with the rest of the CHURCH WORLD &gt;&gt; AND A BUNCH OF THEM ALL REJECTED. THAT'S OKAY. WE'LL KEEP sharing it anyway because I have been ANOINTED BY MARK 16 TO GO into all the world and preach the gospel. What is the gospel? The message OF THIS AGE, NOT SOME message gone by, but in message for this age. &gt;&gt; Seven seals have been revealed. &gt;&gt; The seventh CHURCH'S MESSENGER HAS ALREADY BEEN HERE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. We're just waiting for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Boy, we're close. &gt;&gt; Boy, we're close. &gt;&gt; Or are we not &gt;&gt; Let's continue on just a little bit here. I won't hold you too too long. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Brother Ram says in why Christ speak he says you know the bishop maybe told him now look here son that man's a theologian see he's a fighter &gt;&gt; he was born a fighter he's been a fighter from his youth and you're no match for him &gt;&gt; and his brother said oh you naughty little thing come out here to do such a thing as go on get back home &gt;&gt; brother Brham said that didn't bother him &gt;&gt; why he knew he was anointed The God that delivered me from the lion. The God that delivered me from the paws of that bear. &gt;&gt; He'll more than do that. &gt;&gt; He'll deliver me from this Philistine. Here I come. I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't pray through. He was already prayed through. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We'll leave that for another sermon. God prayed him through before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job. &gt;&gt; He had to speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He had to speak and go forward. You know, Samson was anointed for a job. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; He had to do his job. &gt;&gt; Yes. So now we see Peter and John here in Acts three and they're just walking on an everyday uh walk going to church just like they did every day &gt;&gt; and there was a man sitting there asking for money going I have a need of something and you they stopped by &gt;&gt; and so he expected to get some money but what he got was something greater. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice what the what the uh apostles said. They said silver and gold have I none but that which I have. Amen. &gt;&gt; What did they have? &gt;&gt; They had an anointing on their life. &gt;&gt; Mark 16 said, "Go into all the world preaching the gospel." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; These are Bible's principles that were taught to the disciples and they just went about every day believing it. &gt;&gt; And it went about every day coming to pass just like they believed it because &gt;&gt; it's scripture. &gt;&gt; It's what God has told us. And he vindicated it through a prophet so we can believe that it is true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wish I was a good preacher right now. &gt;&gt; If we could grab on to the promises that God has set before us through this message. It's been vindicated over and over and over and over and over and over. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And over and over and over and over. If we could grab on to those. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Put yourself in the in the in the position of David right now. Come on. &gt;&gt; You've got past experiences. God has brought you through a whole lot of stuff. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We've all got stuff &gt;&gt; and he has brought you through it. How do I know? Cuz you're sitting here. &gt;&gt; And now we're looking at a battle with the devil and we're saying, "Who's anointed to take this devil down? I can't take down your Goliath. You have to take down your Goliath. And you are not alone. You have Jesus Christ on your side. &gt;&gt; He's promised it to be so. It's written in the scriptures. It's been vindicated by the prophet. And so now your only job is to believe it and send that revelation into action. &gt;&gt; I believe there's believers here tonight that have sickness or whatever your your need is. You can raise your hand tonight and you can accept it tonight. &gt;&gt; This isn't an emotional workup. This is the promise of God. And I am willing to accept it tonight. Not some other preacher when he comes. Not some special meetings, not some not next YEAR, BUT RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW, &gt;&gt; I'm saying right now. &gt;&gt; We can accept what the Lord has given to us. And we can accept it right now. &gt;&gt; We don't have to wait for a prayer line. We don't have to wait for communion. But right now, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; because we are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the story of Muhammad Ali. He was the the fighter of all fighters. &gt;&gt; But he would take that check home &gt;&gt; and place it on the kitchen table to more than a conqueror. He would go out there and he would win every battle and he would gain the victory. He would get that c that that that check and he would give it to his wife. &gt;&gt; That's where we're at tonight, church. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has gone to the boxing ring. He's gone through seven rounds with the devil and he has come out with a knockout punch. &gt;&gt; This message is the knockout punch to the devil. Did you hear me? I said this message is the knockout punch to the devil. That's why he fights you so bad. &gt;&gt; Because if there's any church that you would like to get rid of, it's you. &gt;&gt; If there's anybody that you would like to trip up, it's you. &gt;&gt; Because you are this close to reaching out and accepting your promise and putting it into action and saying, "You know what? I've listened to that Goliath long enough. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to write this check out for my deliverance. I'm ready to write this check out for my heal. I'm ready to write this check out for &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not just screaming and shouting. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I'm gonna have to bring this down somehow. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; A reality of Christ's anointing on his bride. This is not a phantom madeup idea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a reality here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You may not feel like it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You may not realize it. &gt;&gt; But you are anointed to take the devil's head off. &gt;&gt; Everybody point to themselves and say, "Me." I am made &gt;&gt; to take the devil's head off &gt;&gt; I don't think everybody got it &gt;&gt; me. I &gt;&gt; am anointed &gt;&gt; to take the devil's head off &gt;&gt; tonight. &gt;&gt; You know the devil's already declared war against you. And sometimes we just think we're in code white not realizing that we're even in a battle. &gt;&gt; But the devil's got one over on you because we are in a battle. We've got battles to fight. And it is our job to take the devil's head off. &gt;&gt; We're going in rapture sometime soon. &gt;&gt; And there's going to be some of us there. &gt;&gt; I just believe that &gt;&gt; God is coming back for us. He ain't coming back for the devil. He ain't coming back to the the bum on the street. NO, HE'S COMING BACK FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a personal relationship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This anointing is not to serve your own desires. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham, after vindication after vindication after vindication and vindication of healing, all these sick people got sick. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The anointing was not for him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Your anointing may be so you never get sick. No, &gt;&gt; the anointing is to defeat Satan. &gt;&gt; How that happens? I do want to tell you, Satan will track where that anointing goes. &gt;&gt; Brother Random would say during prayer lines, he would say he would pray for these women. Then he goes, "Now the anointing that was on her is now over here and he would call it out." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, the devil likes to track that anointing, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He likes to attack you. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham came in and he he he just exposed it like this. He said the devil is a great big bluff. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; He's a squatter. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. Right, &gt;&gt; brother Miguel. If somebody came and squatted your building and they just took it over and said, "This is my building now." I don't think that'd go over too well. &gt;&gt; No, this is my building. &gt;&gt; It has been paid for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's nothing I owe on this thing. &gt;&gt; This is my building. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my family. This is my Bible. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is my church. &gt;&gt; This is my message. THIS IS MY BIBLE. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY. &gt;&gt; Such as I have. &gt;&gt; Now verse six, Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, I give to thee." &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. Now to rise up means to cause to rise, to arise from sleep or to awake. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say he would talk about the greatest anointing that's ever hit the face of the planet. That was when Christ went into the synagogue and he picked up the scroll and he started to read through Isaiah and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to hear what brother Brandham is saying about that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "And now we would think &gt;&gt; if such an anointing was on him, &gt;&gt; he had been prophesying 800 years before that it would come and here it was with that type of anointing. For 800 years, this has been prophesied and has been building and building and building coming to a point for a certain point in time to where all of this would be fulfilled." &gt;&gt; The full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him. We would want to run all over the building, scream and holler, but the Bible said he laid down the scroll &gt;&gt; and he sat down &gt;&gt; and precious words proceeded from his mouth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what he done under the anointing. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be screaming and shouting and dancing all over the the church to be anointed. But the greatest anointing that has ever hit the face of the planet was when Jesus Christ took the scroll, laid it down, and sat down and said, &gt;&gt; "This day, this scripture is fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Oh, but that's not a Pentecostal idea we want to have. &gt;&gt; We want to have screaming and shouting and hollering and I love those things. Those things are great, &gt;&gt; but we're talking about an anointing here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, brother Brandham says, "The anointing is supreme power in control." &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Knowing exactly what and how. &gt;&gt; That is loaded. &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. &gt;&gt; That's what he done under the anointing. The anointing is not emotion. The anointing is supreme power in control. Knowing exactly what and how. See? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then these next words he says &gt;&gt; and that is what's here. &gt;&gt; The greatest anointing &gt;&gt; that has ever hit the face of the planet when Jesus Christ saying came and said this day this scripture is fulfilled was the greatest point in in history where the anointing would have been so thick and it happened and nobody knew it was there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And brother Brandham is saying that that is what is here. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. That is what is right here. Right now is Jesus Christ's anointing. The greatest anointing that has ever hit the face of the planet. The greater anointing than what was on David. A greater anointing than what was on Moses. A greater anointing than what was on Adam in the garden. The greatest anointing that has ever hit the face of the planet. Is here tonight. And it's here for you. And it's here to give you your wants and your desires because it has been promised in the scriptures and vindicated by a prophet to give you an anointing call &gt;&gt; to be anointed for this hour &gt;&gt; to anoint you to face your enemy. &gt;&gt; I can't face it. You must face it. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This battle is not ours. This battle is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; Can I just say, Lord, use me. Lord, I want to take the devil's head off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be anointed to be a devil slayer. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be remembered in history as somebody the devil beat up. &gt;&gt; Who wants to be remembered like that? &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; But I want to be remembered as a man of faith. &gt;&gt; A guy that's willing to take God's word and stand firm. &gt;&gt; And I'll stand here and I'll I'll preach it to kings. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'll preach it to anybody who will listen that this message is the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth shall set you free. &gt;&gt; So where is Christ's anointing? Brother Brandham said his anointing is on his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the letter killth. The spirit giveth life. &gt;&gt; So the anointing is the Holy Spirit on your life. So if you don't have the Holy Spirit, you better get the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; because without God, you won't be overcoming. &gt;&gt; The devil's real. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He likes to make those boasts. &gt;&gt; And without standing firm on the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who knows where you'll end up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But tonight's another opportunity. for that anointing &gt;&gt; to come down on your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not only to be anointed. &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brandham draws this out. He says, "You can have the Holy Spirit every day of your life die and go to hell." &gt;&gt; Boy, that was a shocker. We're looking for not only just the anointing, not only just the the the filling, but we're looking for the sealing finished work on our lives. God bless you. &gt;&gt; But let's rejoice that this anointing is for us. &gt;&gt; This anointing is for just right now, &gt;&gt; not some other age. For us right now, &gt;&gt; it's for you. It's not for your partner. &gt;&gt; It's not for the person sitting next to you. It's for you. &gt;&gt; This message is for you. Is for me. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We love you. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. [Music] Oh Jesus, that's the way. &gt;&gt; I need more of you. Thank you, Jesus. Till there's no room left in me. [Music] All those wasted hours, they're yours now. From the start to the finish. I need more of you through it all. Oh, through it all. [Music] Through it all, [Music] I've learned to trust in Jesus. Yes, I've learned to trust in God. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. through it all. Oh, through it all. [Music] I've learned to depend on. &gt;&gt; Oh my, aren't you glad for the anointing of the Holy Spirit? Oh, I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. There have been times I didn't know right from wrong. Oh, buddy. In every situation, God gave me blessing, consolation that my trials. Hallelujah. All together, can we sing it with conviction now? Oh yes. You've been faithful to me, Lord. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, I've learned. &gt;&gt; Through it all, through it all. Through it all, [Music] I've to [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit has been here tonight. The word of God has come. There should be no second guessing in who you are. The very fact that the Holy Spirit is moving in you to a higher call to believe his word is a fact that it's for you. God has ordained you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God's called you. You you and the word are synonymous. That's what the anointing does. It It makes you that word. It makes it makes you invincible. And the devil wants you to point you, many different directions, but that's that's not what we're called to do. The anointing is upon us to defeat the devil in every area of our lives. Aren't &gt;&gt; you thankful for it? He's coming hard. He's coming hard. And if he can't destroy the anointing, he'll destroy the vessel that the anointing resides in. &gt;&gt; He'll try to destroy you. Stay with that word. You can't fail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that? Let's sing this second verse now. Hallelujah. I have been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces. There were times I felt so all alone. Oh, but in my lonely hours, yes, those precious lonely hours, Jesus let me know I am his own. Hallelujah. Through it all. Oh, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, I've learned &gt;&gt; trust in God. &gt;&gt; Through it all, &gt;&gt; through it all. Through it all, I've learned to depend upon.

We so thankful to be in fellowship with you, to serve the same Lord Jesus, to believe this message together. We consider it such an honor and a privilege. I pray this song will be a blessing to you tonight. I can't get my book to work right, so I have to hold it. But brother Kobe had asked us to sing back in the back. And I had another song in my mind thinking about coming down here and the Lord has put this on my heart. And I hadn't sang in a long time and had to remember the words from memory. So if I mess up, forgive me. It's my fault, not hers. But I pray it's a blessing to you. I think that I'm very thankful that God, you can see the fruit of the Lord in your life. Has God changed you? I pray each one of you see it tonight that I'm not what I was. That's that's something that makes my heart so happy because I remember what I was and I'm not that anymore. I'm not that person anymore. And that's the grace of God to my life. If I were to tell you what he brought for me from, it would shock you. But that's his mercy. And I love him for that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tonight I have spent all the money I've ever owned. And I have squandered all my talent. Oh, there's nothing shown. But now I gladly come just as I am to Jesus. And I pray he could make his good in me. [Music] Oh, maybe he can make his good indeed. Oh, I know I'm not a star like someone else. I don't pretend to be. But this one thing I know for sure is my old wretched soul has found its cure. For he has made his good in me. This old flesh I wear gets so hard to bear. And it's sometimes sweet. My forgetful mind just won't let me find the words to speak. And every day, oh, Satan has to say that there's no need to believe that he could ever make something of me. [Music] God. Oh, he has made his good in me. Oh, I know I'm not a small like someone else. I don't pretend to be. [Music] But this one thing I know for sure is my old wretched soul has found its cure. Oh, for he has made his good in me. And this one thing I know for sure is my old wretched soul has found its cure for he has made his good in me. [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad it's all him. &gt;&gt; Not by our own merits. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, can we stand to our feet and ask the ushers if they didn't mind coming and and taking up an offering here tonight? Amen. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless them now. Lord Jesus, we just come into your presence once again, Lord. And Lord, we thank you for the service and the chance that you've allowed us to have to gather together, Lord, to to be with our brothers and sisters, to to worship you, Lord, and to just be in your presence as we close out this year and begin another one, Lord. Lord, we just Lord, we know that tithes and offerings are are part of our worship, Lord. And Lord, we pray that you would just bless those that are able to give tonight, Lord, and and bless those that aren't. Lord, may it just be used for your kingdom. And Lord, may you just be in the remainder of the service, Lord. We just commit into your hands. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, I am strong. Let the poor say, I am rich. Let the blind say, "I can see." It's what the Lord has done in me. Sing that again. Let the weak, let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say, "I am rich." Let the blind say, "I can see." It's what the Lord has done for me. Hosana. Hosana. Hosana to the lamb that was slain. Hosana. Hosana. Jesus died. Sing it now as brother Josh comes. Hosana. Oh, hosana to the lamb that was slain. [Music] Hosana. [Music] Can we sing that one more time now? Hosana. Hosanana to the lamb was slain. Ohana [Music] died and rose again. Amen. I trust the Lord has been good to you. Praise upon our lips. Amen. Did you enjoy the word of the Lord here this evening? Wonderful. I was blessed by it tremendously and I know you were as well. But if you would have your scriptures, let's go to Hebrews 11:17. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just love that the slideshow Sister Clelet put together. &gt;&gt; Man, just it's incredible to see that we ain't serving a God of yesterday or of the history books, but he's still doing miracles today. Yes. &gt;&gt; And many times we think it's little things he's doing in our lives, but yet those are big things &gt;&gt; that God has given us testimonies of. But Hebrews 11:17, by faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son. Amen. You may be seated this this evening. Here in the church age book, Brother Brandham would quote that scripture and would say, "There it is. A Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise. Most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus' name over the good promises of God that there could not be a trial. But here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise. And and I think that is a powerful thing that talking on the lines of faith. Many people think that faith is just moving mountains and mountain moving faith and that is true. But many times faith is a patient faith where even when it's when trials are coming and temptations are coming, it's patience believing that God has the answer, that God has everything under control. And brother Brandham would talk about the young couple that prayed for would ask them to pray for their dead baby. And it was in Germany, I would believe. And they would call brother Brandham and ask him to come over and pray. And and as he was getting things ready, he would begin to pray. And the Lord would tell him, "Don't go over there, but I'm taking the baby home, and it's my will to take it home." So, Brother Brandon would call him up and would tell him what the Lord had said. And the mother or the wife would ask this question. Is it because of the weakness of my faith? And brother Brandham says, "Oh, no. Your faith is great." He says, "Anybody can have faith when mountains are moving?" But he says, "Let it go back a little bit and that proves whether you have faith or not." So here was a mountain moving faith where God was going to raise that baby up. But it was a patient faith knowing I might not understand what is going on. I might not understand why God has taken my baby home. But yet faith was still believing that God had everything under control. And we've been through some hard times through 25. Been through some wrecks hitting deer right here to deer there in Michigan. But yet God had everything under control. I don't believe that we go through anything by accident. I don't believe that we go through a trial by accident. I don't believe we go through a headache by accident. But God has everything under control. He knew it from before the foundation of the world. Man, it's real faith knowing that God has everything under control. But we don't like the questioning of our faith sometimes, don't we? Brother Brandham would talk about how when Jesus was walking by the woman with the blood issue and she would reach out and would touch the hymn of this garment and the Bible says she felt within herself that the blood had stopped. But brother Brandham says Jesus stopped and said who touched me to prove to her that it had stopped. So she had faith knowing that the miracle had taken place but to prove to her she would question her faith and would say who touched me. So, WE LIKE MOUNTAIN MOVING FAITH, but sometimes it's patient faith in the trenches. It's it's patient faith waiting for the fulfillment of the promises. IT WAS PATIENT FAITH BELIEVING FOR PATRICK to come home and to give us hearts of Christ. IT WAS FAITH JUST THE SAME in the middle of the waiting than it WAS BELIEVING THAT GOD COULD save him. And there's a song that is called I'm going to praise you in the waiting. While we're waiting for the answer, I'm going to praise you just the same. You might be waiting for prodals to come home. You might be waiting for prayers to be answered. It's faith just the same. You might not see it happening today, but it's patient faith saying he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I believe he's got everything under control. And the Bible would tell us that the trying of your faith workketh patience. And patience is an incredible thing because brother Brandon would tell us in the church age book that that God has many promises and the precious promises that he has given us. But he says from the time we pray until we get the answer, we must receive patience in our soul. Because many times we got faith when we're asking for things. We have faith whenever we put our petition to God. But when it seems like God is not answering, many times our faith is wavering. You remember Daniel, he would pray for 21 days. But he would not give up after the first day. He wouldn't give up after the second day. But it was a perseverance knowing if I keep my petition before God. The answer MIGHT NOT BE HERE, BUT IT IS ON THE WAY. AND I BELIEVE MANY answers are on the way. You might not have it right now. It might not have come yesterday, BUT THE ANSWER is upon the way. And the Bible would say when the angel would come to Daniel and would give him a message, the Bible says that DANIEL WAS STRENGTHENED BY THE VOICE of that angel. SO ONCE HE WOULD PERSEVERE WITH A PATIENT FAITH WHEN THAT ANSWER CAME, HE WOULD STRENGTHEN HIM FOR THE JOURNEY. AND WE'RE ALL UPON JOURNEYS TODAY. WE'RE WALKING IN the midst of Leo. We get tired sometimes. WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE WALKING by yourself. WE FEEL LIKE THE WORLD IS AGAINST US. BUT KEEP ON PERSEVERING BECAUSE WHEN THE ANSWER COMES, IT'S GOING TO COME TO STRENGTHEN. IT'S GOING TO COME TO ENCOURAGE. IT'S GOING TO COME TO UPLIFT. WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES IN 2026. BUT THE SAME GOD THAT HAS BROUGHT YOU THROUGH 2025 IS GOING TO BE FAITHFUL TO BE WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, EVERY TRIAL. AND WE THOUGH WE WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I FEAR NO EVIL BECAUSE OF THE PATIENT FAITH, KNOWING THAT HE IS WITH ME. EVEN WHEN I DON'T FEEL HIM, HE IS STILL WALKING WITH ME. EVEN WHEN I DON'T SEE HIM, HE IS STILL THE FRIEND THAT STICKKETH CLOSER THAN A BROTHER. HALLELUJAH. And it's incredible. I I was reading about Joseph the other day and you can look at Psalms 105:19 talking about Joseph until the time his word came. The word of the Lord tried him. Brother Brandon would tell us to be tested or tempted is to be tried is to be tested. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE JOSEPH WOULD HAVE A VISION OF his life on how that the stars would be bowing down to him and the wheat would be bowing down to him. So there was a vision over his life before he ever went through any of the trials, before he was ever sold as a slave, before he was ever lied upon, before he was ever in a prison cell. There was already a vision over his life. And what I THINK IS INCREDIBLE IS THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HIS BROTHERS WOULD SELL HIM as a slave, which is the opposite direction of the kingdom. It would seem like that he was going to SIT IN A POSITION OF POWER WHERE PEOPLE WAS GOING TO BOW down to him. But now HE IS BEING SOLD AS A SLAVE WHICH IS OPPOSITE THAN a king. And could you imagine UH THE MIND BATTLES Joseph might have been having that the Lord had told him he was going to be in A POSITION OF POWER AND NOW BE SOLD as a slave. BUT LITTLE DID HE KNOW WHAT THE DEVIL MEANT FOR EVIL. GOD WAS TURNING AROUND for good. CUZ EVEN THOUGH HE MAY HAVE FELT LIKE IT WAS THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE KINGDOM, IT WAS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WAS USHERING USHERING HIM TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE. AND MANY TIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF OUR VICTORY, GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF OUR ANSWER PRAYER, THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF A BREAKTHROUGH. BUT LITTLE DID YOU KNOW IT IS ORCHESTRATED BY ALMIGHTY GOD AND HE'S GUIDING YOU AND LEADING YOU TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE THAT GOD HAD GIVEN YOU. OH HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT THE LORD WOULD THAT THE LORD WOULD REMEMBER Joseph and would make him prosperous. And what I think is INCREDIBLE IS THAT POTTERER WOULD NOTICE that the Lord had given Joseph FAVOR AND THEN THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT GOD WOULD BLESS THE EGYPTIANS HOUSE FOR JOSEPH'S SAKE. HOW COME? BECAUSE THERE WAS A VISION ON JOSEPH'S LIFE BEFORE HE WAS EVER IN THAT SITUATION. SO THE BLESSINGS OF GOD FALLS ON THE JUST AND THE UNJUST. MANY TIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT THE BLESSINGS OF GOD CAN FALL UPON A COWORKER JUST TO PUSH YOU IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. MAYBE YOUR BUSINESS MIGHT GET BLESSED OR OR THE LORD GIVE YOU SOMETHING FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. IT IS THE BLESSINGS OF GOD FALLING ON SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A VISION OVER YOUR LIFE. AND I SAY, DON'T GIVE UP IN THE HARD TIME. KEEP THE VISION EVER BEFORE YOUR MIND. WE'RE NOT A PEOPLE WITHOUT A VISION. WE'RE NOT A PEOPLE WITHOUT A DIRECTION. BUT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ABSOLUTE IN THIS DIRECTION. KEEP THE VISION. KEEP THE FOCUS. CUZ ONE DAY, THE FULFILLMENT OF EVERY PROMISE IS GOING TO BE BROUGHT INTO MANIFESTATION. BECAUSE LITTLE DID JOSEPH KNOW HE COULD NOT FORGIVE HIS BROTHERS UNLESS HE GOT SOME CHARACTER. HE HAD TO GO THROUGH CHARACTER BUILDING BEFORE HE COULD EVER REIGN. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US, YOU CAN'T REIGN WITH POWER UNLESS YOU GOT CHARACTER. AND IT TAKES THE TESTING. IT TAKES THE HARD TIMES. IT TAKES THE TRIALS THAT IS PREPARING YOU AND EQUIPPING YOU TO FULFILL THE PROMISES THAT GOD HAS FOR YOUR LIFE. Are you thankful for that this evening? Brother Brand, I'm going to say this here. God, I believe today before he puts his church in power, HE TRIES HIS CHURCH TO SEE WHAT it will do. AND I'M SO THANKFUL THAT GOD IS TESTING US, BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS we're going to fulfill THE TEST. HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PASS THE TEST. AND I'M SO THANKFUL THAT GOD NEVER GETS SHOOK UP. He never gets worried when we go through the hard times. He never gets worried whenever things don't work out according to our plans. But yet, he knows the end from the beginning. Are you thankful for that this evening? God bless you. Woo. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; As brother Jonathan gets ready to come, can we sing this? Oh, I will praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will praise the Lord. Oh, no matter what tomorrow brings, what it has in store, I will praise the Lord. I will praise the Lord. Oh, will you praise him? I will praise the Lord &gt;&gt; no matter what tomorrow or what it has in store. I will praise the Lord. Amen. Will you praise him in 2026? &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT STOPPING NOW. AMEN. God bless you. I love you. So so glad to be here. Amen. So Amen. I preach after all them, man. What What are y'all doing to me? Amen. Brother, that was wonderful. Truly enjoyed it. Amen. So, but you know, I just thought this week today, actually, I was thinking I preached a message back home a few weeks ago on on looking beyond yourself and looking at your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; All right. And I believe as we close out this year and we start this year, IT'S JUST BEEN A A terrible just a great burden upon my heart. If we can get the people of God to see that anointing, &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, &gt;&gt; TO SEE THAT ANOINTING IS TODAY UPON THE BRIDE TO SEE IT TODAY THAT WE HAVE THE POWER OF GOD, THAT WE HAVE THE FAITH TO DO THAT. AND AND IF WE LOOK IN THE SCRIPTURE, AND I BELIEVE BROTHER BREN WOULD TELL US WE NEED MORE CALEBS AND JOSHUA'S IN OUR DAY. AND I BELIEVE IF WE LOOK AT THAT SCRIPTURE, WELL, THEY COME TO THEIR PROMISED LAND. AND AND I BELIEVE WE CAN TYPE THIS AND WE CAN SEE IN 2025, YOU KNOW, I I'VE TOLD PEOPLE FOR YEARS, READ THE OLD TESTAMENT, READ THE NEW TESTAMENT, LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE, AND BRING IT TO WHO YOU ARE TODAY. BECAUSE THE OLD TESTAMENT MEANS NOTHING IF IT'S JUST A STORY. BUT IF IT'S LIFE INSIDE OF US, THEN IT HAS A MEANING INSIDE OF US. AND AND WE CAN SEE THEM COMING TO THEIR PROMISED LAND. THEY'RE COMING TO THAT LAND OF MILK AND HONEY, BUT THERE HAD TO BE SOMEBODY TO GO CLAIM IT. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AND THERE'S A BRIDE TODAY THAT IS COMING TO A RAPTURE. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY TO GO CLAIM THAT RAPTURE AND SAY, "THAT IS MY ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; THAT IS MY WORD. THAT IS WHAT I NEED TO DO." NOT SIT ON A CHURCH BENCH. NOT SIT THERE, BUT SAY, "THAT IS ME. &gt;&gt; I'M THE RAPTURING BRIDE OF 20." WHATEVER IT MAY BE. WE'RE LEARING THAT TONGUE. &gt;&gt; THAT ANOINTING HAS BEEN POURED OUT. IT IS FOR THE BRIDE TO STEP UP AND SAY, "THAT IS WHO I AM." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. YOU SAY, "OH, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HUMBLE." YOU CAN BE HUMBLE BUT STILL KNOW WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS A HUMBLE MAN, BUT WHEN JESUS WALKED, THEY KNEW WHO HE WAS. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; OH MY. BUT THEY'RE STANDING AT THEIR PROMISED LAND IN NUMBERS CHAPTER 13 AND VERSE UH 30 WE'LL READ DOWN AND IT SAID AND CALEB STEALED THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES AND HE SAID LET US GO AT ONCE. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THAT ANOINTING &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH. WE HEARD ABOUT THAT ANOINTING. IT HAD FELL UPON TWO MEN OF GOD. AND THEY SAID WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE ENEMY. WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE DEVIL HAS. THE ANOINTING IS UPON US TO CLAIM OUR POSSESSION. AMEN. HE SAID, "LET US GO UP AT ONCE AND POSSESS IT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FOR WE ARE WELL ABLE TO OVERCOME IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SAYS, "BUT THE MEN THAT WENT UP WITH HIM AND HE SAYS WE ARE NOT." HE SAID, "WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GO UP." REMEMBER, THEY THEY CREATED A LIE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; HE TELLS YOU YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. &gt;&gt; HE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T FIGHT THIS BATTLE. HE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T LIVE ANOTHER DAY. HE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T BE HEALED FROM THIS SICKNESS. HE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T OVERCOME THIS. THAT'S THE LIE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE TRUTH IS &gt;&gt; GOD IS ON THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS THE ANOINTING IS ON THE BRIDE. THE TRUTH IS YOU ARE ABLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, HE GOES AND HE SAYS, AND I WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS IN VERSE 33. AND HE SAYS, THERE WE SAW THE GIANTS. HAVE YOU SAW THE GIANTS? &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IT AIN'T GOLIATH NO MORE. I'VE SAID IT SO MANY TIMES. I WISH IT WAS GOLIATH. I'M A PURELY BURNING SCRAPPY FELLER. I THINK I CAN TAKE MY CHANCE. BUT IT AIN'T GOLIATH. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ENEMIES THAT FACE YOU AND I. IT'S OUR GOLIATHS IN OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, WE ARE. &gt;&gt; And they saw the giants, THE SONS OF ACHI, and we were in our own sight. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; AS GRASSHOPPERS, &gt;&gt; AND SO WAS we in their sight. I want you TO SEE THAT &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T SEE THEM THAT WAY, &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF GOD. THE DEVIL DON'T SEE YOU THAT WAY. THE DEVIL KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU'RE THE BRIDE. THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU'RE GOING IN A RAPTURE. THE DEVIL KNOWS THE POWER THAT YOU HAVE AND HE'S SHAKING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; BUT YOU think in your own eyes, &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS. AND YOU TAKE THAT WORD GRASSHOPPER. GRASSHOPPER MENTALITY. IT MEANS SEEING PROBLEMS AS HUGE IN YOURSELF AS SMALL. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BUT WAIT A SECOND. I THOUGHT GOD LIVED IN US. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; IF GOD LIVES IN ME, THEN I'M NO LONGER SMALL. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER JONATHAN, YOU'RE NOT BEING HUMBLE ENOUGH. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I KNOW WHO LIVES IN ME. I KNOW THE BATTLES I'VE BEEN THROUGH. I KNOW THE VICTORIES THAT I'VE COME THROUGH. I KNOW MY GOD IS ABLE. &gt;&gt; GREATER IS HE THAT LIVES IN ME THAN ALL THAT'S IN THE WORLD. HE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AS HUGE. YOUR SELF IS SMALL AND INCAPABLE. HE SAID, "OH, IS IT OFTEN STREAMING FROM FEAR?" &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS DAY IS MADE OF. EVERYBODY WANTS YOU TO BE SCARED. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED OF SICK. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED OF CO. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED OF THE BILLS. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED OF THIS. AND YOU LIVE ALL HUNKLED DOWN IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND YOU WON'T JUST WALK OUT AND DO WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO DO. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; Comes from fear, &gt;&gt; LOW SELF-ESTEEM, UNBELIEF PREVENTING YOU FROM SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES OR FULFILLING YOUR POTENTIAL. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS AIN'T JUST NUMBERS. THIS IS THE DAY WE LIVE IN. &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE NOT CLOSER TO GOD THAN WE ARE? BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR OWN MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR OWN FAILURES. WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR OWN ABILITIES. AND WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THAT THE ANOINTING OF GOD HAS BEEN POURED OUT UPON OUR BRAIN. AND WHAT YOU SAY, HE WILL DO. &gt;&gt; He'll do it every time. &gt;&gt; AND I WE LOOK AT THAT AND I BEGIN TO THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE WE QUOTE IT ALL THE TIME. I DO MYSELF AND THE SCRIPTURE DOES AND BROTHER BRENNHAM WOOD. THAT HE CAME TO STEAL, TO KILL, AND DESTROY. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE DID. &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT? &gt;&gt; He can't. &gt;&gt; He can't. &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE CAN'T. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO STEAL A PENNY FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. LOOK AT THE TESTIMONIES YOU JUST SAW BEFORE YOU. IF IT AIN'T YOUR TIME, HE CAN SEND A FIRE AND IT AIN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU. COME ON. HE CAN SEND CANCER. IT AIN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU. HE CAN SEND HEART DISEASE. IT AIN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU. WHY? CUZ HE CAN'T KILL YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. WE GO TO A LIFE THAT WE LIVE NOW. AND IF YOU COULD GET THE MENTALITY THAT THE ANOINTING OF GOD WAS POURED OUT UPON YOU, YOU WOULD FACE EVERY BATTLE LIKE, "OH, WHAT AM I GOING TO WIN TODAY?" &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT ARROGANCE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S KNOWING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT GOD IS ON MY SIDE. I CANNOT FAIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, but brother Jonathan, THIS BODY. OH, YEAH. THIS BODY, TOO. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I GOT UPSET THE OTHER DAY AND FUSS AT MY BOSS. THAT'S REAL SMART. COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; CUZ THEN I ALWAYS HAVE TO GO BACK AND APOLOGIZE BECAUSE GOD STARTS WHOOPING ME. &gt;&gt; AND THEN I HAD TO GO TO MY PASTOR AND TELL MY PASTOR, I WAS NOT A GOOD BOY. &gt;&gt; I MADE MISTAKES. I FAILED. GOD SENT THAT TEMPTATION AND I FELL. BUT I KNOW HE'S GREATER AND HE LIVES INSIDE OF ME AND HE CAN TRY TO STEAL. HE CAN TRY TO STEAL MY JOY, BUT HE CAN'T STEAL MY JOY. &gt;&gt; HE CAN'T STEAL YOUR PEACE. &gt;&gt; CHILDREN OF GOD, WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ANXIETY. IT'S ALL ABOUT DEPRESSION. IT'S ALL ABOUT MENTAL WARFARE THAT WE'RE IN. AND THE ENEMY IS TRYING TO DESTROY YOU WITH EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IF HE CAN'T GET YOU, HE'LL GET YOUR LOVED ONE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IF HE CAN'T GET YOU TO FELL, HE'LL GET SOMEBODY THAT YOU LOVE. HE'LL TAKE SOMEBODY AND SLIDE THEM OUT THE CHURCH DOOR THAT YOU LOVE AND YOU WOULD LIVE AND YOU WOULD DIE FOR. &gt;&gt; HE'S AFTER YOU. &gt;&gt; But he can't. &gt;&gt; He can't. He came &gt;&gt; to kill. He came to steal. He came TO DESTROY. &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAN'T. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE CAN'T DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT anointing &gt;&gt; is now poured OUT UPON A BRIDE. And brother Brennham said, "You speak it. &gt;&gt; I'll perform it." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS GOD SPEAKING TO HIS BRIDE. YOU SAW THAT WAS BROTHER BRENNHAM. THAT WAS GOD TALKING TO BROTHER BRENNHAM. NO. ALL THAT HE GAVE THE PROPHET, THE PROPHET THEN LAID IT IN A MESSAGE AND HE PRESENTED IT TO THE PRIDE AND HE SAID, "THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE POWER TO BIND. YOU HAVE THE POWER TO LOOSE. YOU HAVE THE POWER TO TELL THE DEVIL TO GET BEHIND YOU. YOU HAVE THE power &gt;&gt; to look the devil IN THE EYE AND SAY, "YOU'RE nothing &gt;&gt; but a bluff." &gt;&gt; 2026 IS HERE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; I CAN LOOK 2026 IN THE FACE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; AND GO, DEVIL, I KNOW YOU'RE COMING. &gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU'RE COMING. &gt;&gt; I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU'RE COMING. &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT, DEVIL? HE'S ON MY SIDE. AND IF HE'S ON MY SIDE, HE'S DONE DEFEATED YOU. HE'S DONE TOOK THE POWER FROM YOU. HE'S DONE TOOK ALL THAT YOU HAD AND HE'S PLACED HIS ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON. LET'S JUST BE REAL HONEST ABOUT IT. I WONDER IF WE COULD JUST BE REAL WITH OURSELVES AND WE COULD FORGET ABOUT OUR FAILURES. WE COULD FORGET ABOUT OUR THOUGHTS. COME ON, CHURCH. WE'RE HUMAN HERE. &gt;&gt; THERE AIN'T NO ANGELS IN THE BUILDING. &gt;&gt; WE GO THROUGH THINGS. &gt;&gt; AND BUT WE COULD GO BACK AND WE COULD FEEL WHAT WAS PREACHED TO US TONIGHT, THAT ANOINTING IN HIM, AND WE CAN LOOK THE DEVIL IN THE FACE. COME ON. &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "HEY, DEVIL, you know THAT ANOINTING THAT WAS ON JESUS CHRIST? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD HIM KILLED, &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD HIM IN THE GRAVE, &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD DESTROYED GOD, &gt;&gt; REMEMBER ON THAT THIRD DAY, WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; Guess what? &gt;&gt; That same anointing &gt;&gt; is in me. &gt;&gt; And you can't &gt;&gt; still. &gt;&gt; You can't. OH, BUT BROTHER JONATHAN, HE'S GOTTEN ME DOWN BEFORE. THAT'S CUZ YOU LET HIM. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; GOD AIN'T WANTING HIS BRIDE TO BE SAD. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. GOD AIN'T WANTING HIS BRIDE TO GO AROUND LIKE A BUNCH OF A BUNCH OF POOR PEOPLE THAT AIN'T GOT NO JOY, THAT AIN'T GOT NO PEACE. NO, HE WANTS YOU TO WORSHIP HIM EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S LOOKING AT YOU, &gt;&gt; if you'll just see, &gt;&gt; get your eyes off of you, &gt;&gt; brother. get it upon that sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan would say, HE SAYS, "OH, I CAN'T DO it neither." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "You say you can't live right." He says, "I can't do it either." &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "But he can." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I love you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't we sing this song? Stand to our feet. Try this. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. Taking back my soul, my dance, my joy, and my peace. Taking back everything that the devil stole from me. Verse two. Oh, we all know that the devil comes still to kill and destroy. And I must admit that from time to time, he's taken away my joy. But I'm serving notice on the devil today. His kingdom is under attack. Cuz I'm born my way down to his gate. And I'm taking my property back. I'm taking it back. How many can say that tonight? Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back. The devil stole from me. Taking back my soul, my dance, my peace. Taking it back. Everything without the devil. Sing that one more time. Now I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back.

So, if you know it, um, just sing it with us. Just seems really fitting for this time of year. So, may it just be a blessing. [Music] Are you weary from the battle you're fighting? Do you feel like the storm just won't break? Is there a mountain in front of you? The doubt says we'll never move. And you wonder, will God make a way? Tell me a time he's not been faithful. Tell me a morning his mercies were new. Tell me a moment he was enable to car you through. Tell me a day he was less than almighty. &gt;&gt; When he could, he roll back the time. Child, when you look back, you're going to find there was never a time. [Applause] [Music] So be strong in the Lord and remember to hold fast to faith and stand firm. [Music] Oh, you can be confident the Lord keeps his promises. If you doubt it, just read through his word. [Music] Tell me a time he's not been faithful. Tell me, oh Lord, his mercies were new. Tell me a moment, he was unable to carry you through. Tell me a day he was less than all when he could roll back the town. child, bring you back, you're going to find there was never a time. [Music] He can work miracles, do the impossible. If you don't believe it, go on and try. Oh, to tell me a time he's not been faithful. Tell me a morning his mercies were new. Tell me a moment he was in a car through. Tell me a day he was less than almighty when he could hold back the time. Tell me when you look back. You're going to find There was never a day he was less than almighty when he couldn't roll back the time. Child, when you look back, you're going to find there was never a time. Oh child, when you look back, you're going to find there was never a time [Applause] Has there ever been a time where he wasn't faithful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; As we ask brother John to come, can we sing this here? Um &gt;&gt; I trust in God. Just just the chorus. Hey, &gt;&gt; I trust in God, my savior, the one who will never fail. You will never fail. Oh, I trust in God. [Music] fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Boy, what a night we've had tonight. I I tell you what, this this eating so good. I think we ought to have these services every night, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's uh good for a believer's heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then speaking of David, I I like David and you know because David was anointed. He was the anointed king. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But in Acts 2 and 25 it says, "For David speaketh concerning him. I foraw the Lord always before my fa face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved." &gt;&gt; Therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad. Moreover, also my flesh shall rest in hope. &gt;&gt; I like that because we can rest. We can be at peace in hope. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And David was anointed and he was the the great king and and he never lost that anointing. That anointing didn't go away. He He was king. He was anointed king from the time that he was young to the time that he was old. David was the anointed king. Right. &gt;&gt; And also in all this time, God would say that David was a man after his own heart, &gt;&gt; right? David was God just loved David so much to say, "That's my heart." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But do you realize how many mistakes that David made? &gt;&gt; How many times David fell? &gt;&gt; David was actually a murderer. &gt;&gt; But but let let but let me say this because there was a time when David turned around and said, "Blessed is the man." &gt;&gt; Yeah. that God doesn't impute the sin too. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because there is a waiting time. There is a period in your time of your faith that you have to wait and the temptations come and all of these trials come and you're waiting and you're waiting and there's going to come times that we do fall. &gt;&gt; There's going to be times that we make mistakes. There's going to be times that we allow the doubt to stop us. &gt;&gt; But let us not stay there. &gt;&gt; David was quick to repent. David was quick to fall on the ash heap and say, "Lord, forgive me. Lord, Lord, don't let this fall upon my children," which was Israel. &gt;&gt; David was like, "Don't let this fall on them. You bring this is me. Lord, I'm sorry. Forgive me." &gt;&gt; And then he would stand up and he would continue being the king. He would continue believing in God. He would continue in the walk in the faith. And too many times in our life, we let the guilt fester. We let the pain in our hearts hold us back. We can't worship God. We can't have joy in God. It's not because God ain't there. God said he would never leave you. He would never forsake you. God ain't left you. God ain't gone nowhere. God is still here. So stop staying in the past. Fall on your spiritual ash heap and say, "Lord, forgive my unbelief and help me move forward. We are coming into a new year. We are coming upon the time this whole thing's wrapping up and we ain't got time for guilt. We ain't got time. We can come before the throne of God completely blameless. &gt;&gt; We can come to him as though we have never ever done it. &gt;&gt; So don't let the things of this world and the things of this life hold you back. Turn your face back to Jesus Christ and let's move this church forward and go out of here because I want to go home. You want to go home. The time is here and we can do it. And we can do it with a smile on our face. &gt;&gt; And I can smile even though it doesn't make me look good. I know. But I'll smile anyways &gt;&gt; because the Bible never said I had to be goodlook. &gt;&gt; All right. It never said that. It said I had to believe. And brothers and sisters, I believe because blessed is the man and I love my God and I have faith in my God that he will carry me through. Will I make mistakes? Absolutely. But I know when I turn back to him and I say, "God, I'm sorry. It's as though I never did it in the first place." And you say, "Brother, how do you know?" Because the Bible also says that your transgressions go so far as the east to the west. Well, what is the east to the west, brothers and sisters? It's from one nail scarred hand to the other nail scarred hand holding your entire life in control. He's got it. Fall down on your knees and turn back to the heavenly father. God bless you all, brother Kobe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I enjoyed that. I've been enjoying all the preaching so far. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. As brother Sam gets ready to come, can we go to F? &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. Oh, hopeless gates and empty place. if not for grace. Once again, amazing grace. Lord, &gt;&gt; I once was lost. Oh, but thank God I'm found. &gt;&gt; Was a hopeless king. Oh, an empty space. If God, you sing that to him again. Oh, where would I be? Lord, you only know. I'm so glad you see through eyes of love was a hopeless &gt;&gt; just an empty space if not for praise. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you each one this evening. It's such a privilege and honor to be here with you. We love you very much. &gt;&gt; Anybody know that about me? &gt;&gt; Enough of you know me that I love you. &gt;&gt; That I pray for you that we thank a lot of you. It's such a blessing to be in fellowship with you. I pray you know that about me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't think I'm up there plotting against you or anything like that, but we love you very much. We consider it an honor to be a believer in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I was thinking the other day had some discouraging things. Was thinking about some folks that have fallen away and that breaks my heart so terribly. And and I thought, you know, if this goes on much longer, seem like hardly going to be very many people left. And and it might be that way. But it's been the grace of God that's kept you and I. &gt;&gt; It ain't been nothing good about Sam Parker. Ain't one good bit about it. You young people don't think you're looking at someone perfect. Ain't a perfect person in the room &gt;&gt; except the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, one of my favorite quotes from that day on Calvary, brother Ram said, "Of course you're not worthy. You never could be worthy, but a worthy one took your place." &gt;&gt; Now, there's a beautiful thing about that in this day, this dispensation that God's done through this open revealed word is what's happened is you've taken his place. &gt;&gt; See, he already took your place back then. That was my nails. Those were my scars. THOSE WERE MY THORNS. HE TOOK THAT FROM ME. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And now we're here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And still here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And 2025 has been the longest year of my life. I keep thinking about things that happened years ago. No, that was just early this year. &gt;&gt; But I I I could spend hours and hours sharing testimonies what the Lord has done this year proving this. He's been faithful. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we've had prayers answered this year that just we me and Bethany, we've we've had really burdened things. We we get up against a mountain and and like the prophet say, sometimes you you know you can't go through it. You can't get under it. Can't get over it. All you can do is let God do his thing. &gt;&gt; And there's times we've watched him completely move it out of the way in a moment. And other things you just sit still. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets worse. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON. SEE, I'm not here tonight to sell you some flowery bed of ease. I was witnessing to some gentleman a couple years ago and they said, "Boy, you you sure ain't you ain't talking this up very good." I said, "I want you to know that if you set your foot on this road, if you step into this way, you better be prepared for battle. &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T FOUGHT A FIGHT UNTIL YOU TRY TO SERVE THE LORD. YOU AIN'T DONE NOTHING THAT ever come against A OPPOSITION UNTIL YOU BEGIN TO SERVE THE LORD." AND NOW YOU KNOW WHAT A FIGHT'S LIKE. &gt;&gt; And you can't be flighty. You've got to BE DECIDING. YOU'VE GOT TO BE SOLD OUT, LORD. I know. &gt;&gt; I don't care what happens to anyone else. I don't care if every PERSON IN THIS ROOM WALKS OUT. I WANT TO SERVE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I DONE DECIDED. AND IT WASN'T SAM PARKER THAT DECIDED. IT'S THE GREATER ONE THAT'S LIVING IN ME. HE HELPED ME. HE'S THE ONE THAT BROUGHT THAT TO PASS. HE'S THE ONE THAT'S PRODUCING FRUIT ACCORDINGLY. &gt;&gt; BY THE GRACE OF GOD. I'm so thankful for this message. &gt;&gt; Young brothers, young sisters, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GRACE OF GOD. THINGS GET COMMON WHEN IT'S your mom and your dad and your grandparents. It might GET COMMON TO YOU, BUT YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE MOST POWERFUL THING THAT HAS EVER ENTERED THIS DIMENSION. &gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT MERCY AND HE LETS YOU BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; AND I WAS RAISED IN THIS MESSAGE. I KNOW WHAT IT LIKE WAS I believed the message ever since a young boy, but there's times that I just want to do things out there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't want to walk this way like I ought to. I don't want to do this like I ought to. BUT I THANK GOD he brought me back. &gt;&gt; That's another thing you need to thank God for. THERE'S A SEED OF GOD IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T PUT IT THERE. YOUR MOM AND DAD DIDN'T PUT IT THERE. HE PUT IT THERE. AND HE PROMISED HE WON'T LOSE ONE. &gt;&gt; All of you that are praying for your loved ones, you want to talk about an intercessor. BROTHER RAM PREACHED A SERMON called standing in the gap. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT GREATER WORKS? THE PROPHET SAID THAT YOU CAN GRANT ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT. THIS ISN'T JUST RAISING THE DEAD OR HEALING THE SICK, GIVING THE BLIND SIDE, GIVING THE DEATH OR OH, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He made that commentary. This is supreme power in control. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You want to see character on display? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you why. Let me read to you out of Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 6. He says, "For thou are an holy people unto the Lord thy God. You listen to me everybody tonight? Everybody still awake? &gt;&gt; Have I bored you? Have I got you distracted? A word about something? Let Let me Let me keep going on. He said, "You're a holy people unto the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee &gt;&gt; to be kicked down and run out and defeated and anxiety and depressed and broke and scared AND AM I NOT QUOTING? &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Come on. to be a special people. &gt;&gt; And just like him, the the Bible would prophesied about him. There'd be no beauty that you're desiring. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as far as natural sight and natural affection, there might not be something your flesh don't want there, but oh, I thank God there's something deeper. &gt;&gt; I think there's God there's something deeper that was placed on the inside before there was a world. And it's that seed OF GOD THAT RESOUNDS BACK. IT'S THAT MAGNETIC PULL TO THE WORD. WHEN THAT WORD CROSSES YOUR PATH, THAT LIGHT COMES ACROSS YOUR PATH AND IT SPARKS IT AND BRINGS IT forth &gt;&gt; because you're a chosen peopleless &gt;&gt; and he said you're special. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Was quoting the other day out of Psalms and he said the the heavens declare the glory of God and the earth shows his handiwork. All the firmament, everything there is. You know, there are galaxies, you listen to me, young people, there are galaxies that have not been allowed to even name yet. They're so far and so expansive and such just it's it's immersive to even imagine WHAT IT IS, WHAT GOD HAS DESIGNED. THOSE ARE HIS HANDIWORK. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; You see, AND HE PUT EVERY SPECK OF DUST THERE. HE PUT EVERY SPECK OF PARTICLE AND ATOM. HE PUT EVERY BELT AROUND EVERY PLANET. HE GREW EVERY GAS GIANT, EVERY MOON. HE DID THAT THING TO SHOW YOU HOW BIG HE IS. ARE YOU IMPRESSED TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; AND NOW IN THIS DAY, THIS WORD'S COME FORTH. &gt;&gt; THIS WORD IS THIS WORD HAS COME FORTH AND YOUR PRO YOUR PROPHET TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD SENT SAM PARKER, ELIJAH THE PROPHET, AND YOU CAN ACCEPT HIM IF YOU WANT. HE SENT HIM TO ME AND HE TOLD ME WHAT THIS GOD HAS DONE AND THIS SEAL THAT'S BEEN OPENED AND THIS WORD THAT'S BEEN EXPOSED AND THIS CHARACTER THAT'S BEEN RELEASED AND THIS PERSON THAT STEPPED FORWARD. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I'm impressed. I am impressed tonight. &gt;&gt; AND THAT ONE CAUSED ME SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; THAT ONE CAUSED me chosen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you thank God for that. HE SAID, "ABOVE ALL THE people that are upon the face of the earth, THE LORD DID NOT SET his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any other people. For you were the fewest of all people, the least of these, &gt;&gt; but because Oh, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; You love your love story. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm I'm a hopeless romantic. I love a good love story. And and let me let me read that to you. A LOVE STORY. BUT BECAUSE the Lord loved me, [Music] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOOD. &gt;&gt; You put yourself right under that moniker that that he loves me. &gt;&gt; Didn't just love me before there was a world. Didn't just love me before there was a galaxy. He loves me now. &gt;&gt; He know the mistake I made yesterday and the day before and the ones I make next week. He knew every time I fall, EVERY MISTAKE, EVERY SLIP, EVERY EVERY HUMAN WEAKNESS, HE KNEW IT. HE STILL CHOSE TO LOVE ME. &gt;&gt; OH, praise his name. &gt;&gt; He said he loves you. And because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, redeemed you out of the house of bondage, you've been set free tonight, redeemed you out OF THE YOU REALIZE THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE. THAT WAS THAT KNOCK ON THE DOOR OF that age, of that latest AGE, TELLING YOU TO COME OUT OF THAT BONDAGE. COME INTO THE LIGHT. COME INTO THE WORD. LET ME HAVE FREEDOM IN YOUR LIFE. LET ME LIBERATE YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; To be loved by him. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Really enjoyed that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm enjoy I've enjoyed it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we got some some fine ministers here tonight. Amen.

Let the redeemer of the Lord say so tonight. What a love. Hallelujah, man. God bless you. You may be seated. I know he puts you on the spot, but can we hear from you later? &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, then you'll have to hear her next time she's here. Amen. God bless you. Praise the Lord. I was lost when you found me here. You pulled me close and held me near. And I'm a fool, but still you love. I'll be a fool for the king of love. You gave me wings so I could fly. and gave me a song to color the sky. And all I have is all from you. And all I want is all of you. It's grace. It's your grace. I'm nothing without you is grace. Your grace shines on me. There have been days when I've walked away. Too much to carry. Nothing left to say. Forgive me, Lord, when I'm weak and lost. You traded heaven for a wooden cross. And all these years you've carried me. You've been my eyes when I could not see. And beauty grows in the driving rain. Your oil of gladness in the time of pain. It's grace. Your grace. I'm nothing without you. It's grace. Your grace shines on me. It's grace. Your grace.

[Music] Your grace and glory [Music] be all my fault and soul my [Music] Amen. Are you glad that he did that for you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Looked beyond your fault and saw your need. Amen. &gt;&gt; I certainly like to say that I've enjoyed the words that have been spoke here this evening. And u you know, I I I kind of felt like a semi failure. You know, I would think that between four ministers, I would have uh been able to amen 25 minutes out of each one of them, but I and be able to get a full hour so I don't end up here. But that's not my that's not my lot. And so um but uh I certainly have enjoyed the words that have been spoken here this here this evening, you know, and u you know I have um don't really have anything much here to say. I other than I love the Lord and I was just kind of thinking about uh the slideshow that was that was uh Sister Kala had made and I believe that she just done a great job with that slideshow and um and I really like those little slideshows like that because throughout the year you forget really what the Lord has done and even the small uh miracles that the Lord had done with the healing of the body and and different ones that had situations in their lives with breaks and uh and the Lord had really uh moved on our uh on our behalf here this year. And if I could just for a few moments maybe just give a small testimony, but uh there in there in uh second Timothy uh the first chapter starting at the sixth verse. is a familiar passage of scripture, one that I really like to kind of lean on when we talking about remembrance and but it reads like this. It says, "Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in me in thee by the putting on of my hands." And I was thinking about this as we were uh going through the the slideshow and I was thinking about remembrance about how God that uses remembrance as a as something that we can do to relate back to what God has done. and going through that and in my life just throughout this this this past year. Uh you know, I've had a lot of uh ups and I had a lot of good days as well as I've had some bad days to go along with that. And and you know, thinking about some of the good times that I might have had this year. here. I've got to been able to spend time with my family and we able uh be able I was able to go uh do some vacationing and and be able to be uh with with my children and my wife and the Lord had blessed me be able to be into with in several meetings, be able to be there uh brothers and be able to, you know, be down there in Arkansas and just be into several places and just uh and the Lord has, you know, blessed me just uh just h had just many things throughout the year and and been thinking about those kinds of things. I just want to I just want to thank the Lord for all of those. But yet at the same time, uh I got to be able to be able to take everything as it comes. And sometimes that in life that we we don't just ride throughout the year on all the good things, but but there's a lot of bad things that have happened. There's a lot of things that in our life that if we're not careful, we begin to look over those things of of why God would put certain things in our life for us to be able to to remember back upon. and and thinking about some of these things. You can go back and you can look about uh I at the moment when I was looking back at the slideshow and we had that fire that was going on and and I had come home one day and they were talking about 60 m an hour winds and I was just kind of thinking like yeah whatever. You know, this is just the weatherman and this guy's about 50/50. And I begin to go out there and I look and the wind is going sideways. And I begin to look I look out the window and a bulldozer passes by my house and I'm thinking, "This can't be good. I've never seen a diesel with a bulldozer down the back of my deadend road." And then I begin I begin to go down there and there's just I go over the hill and there's fire just all over the hillside and I'm thinking this can't be good. And and the wind is be it was coming my way. And at that moment, I begin to think I was like, "Is this possibly going to reach my house?" And about 5 to 10 minutes later, it's past my neighbor's house and it's jumping over the it's jumping over the uh uh jumping over the woods and it's heading towards my place. And you know, you begin to think and all the brothers that had been there and uh doing everything that we could to try to make preparation for what was going on. And at the moment, you know, it just didn't really seem like God was there. But yet, you know, his people was there. And I knew that I had a promise that it didn't really matter of anything that anything, you know, these are just materialistic things. But, you know, the main thing is that my family's safe, you know, and it didn't come on me all of a sudden. And, you know, my my uh my family's down the road. And and I begin to look at these things and thank God for those blessings that were on my life. And I begin to look again down the road and I begin to see just a lot of little things in my life where you have uh spiritual battles that you go through. just things where the Lord has brought you through and and and there's and you could think of maybe financial troubles or you can maybe think of just uh fam family issues that would that you go through in your life and you can just relate to some of these things that are that are going on throughout the throughout the year and you can go back and you can thank God not only for the good times but Lord thank you for your bad times to be able to show me your plan and to be able to show me that you're there and to be able to show me that that you're real. And I begin to think about another passage of scripture. If y'all just forgive me, but but looking at another passage of scripture is uh there in in in the book of Psalms starting there in the 23rd uh chapter there in the 10th verse. It says, "Remove not the old landmarks and enter not into the fields of the fatherless." And I begin to think about how that why would God begin why would God throughout the year begin to have us experience a lot of these things that we go through. We have the good times and then we have the bad times. Now, there's a lot of times in my Christian walk when I go back and I look begin I begin to look at key situations and I begin to look at key areas in my life of where God has brought me out. And yes, on the mountain tops, those are some of the most greatest experience. But it's down in the valley and it's down in the stormy days and it's down in the times where it just seems like it there was just a dark cloud that you couldn't be able to press through. That's the moment that I realized God was the provider. That was the moment that I had realized that God had put me through those valleys. God had put me through those situations because he was developing landmark places in my life that I could look back in the fire and I could realize amen that he's the wind and that he's the water and that he has the ability that but I could look back when it was time that that that my bills couldn't be paid or I just look but I begin to look and be say God amen he can look down and he begin to meet my needs. Now the most great thing I love about Israel is Israel. Everything that they did, God wanted them to mark them. He whether it was stones, whether it was whether it was a sticks, whether it was, you know, whatever it might have been, he he done things that they would mark them. And and we live in a generation where they tear down the landmarks. They tear down of the things that we've done in the past. They they do it in the name of change. They do it in the name of of starting new civilization. And what they do is they do they they they they they take away the next generation's ability to see, Amen. what what has happened in the past. And what if we're not careful, we forget WHAT GOD DID IN 200 2025, moving into 2026. AMEN. WE DEPRIVE OURSELVES OF THE OF THE REMEMBRANCE. WE DEPRIVE OURSELVES OF THE LANDMARK. WE DEPRIVE OURSELVES, AMEN, OF THE ABILITY TO LOOK BACK AND SEE GOD AS THE PROVIDER. AMEN. HE WILL MEET MY NEEDS JUST AS HE DID IN 2000 OR 2025 THAT HE'LL MEET MY NEEDS IN 2026. AMEN. And my may not have food on my table in my life in 25, BUT IN 26 GOD WILL BE THERE TO MEET MY NEEDS. REMOVE NOT THE OLD LANDMARKS THAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU IN 2025. AMEN. Doesn't matter if they're good or doesn't matter IF THEY'RE BAD. GOD DONE THESE THINGS TO SHOW YOU THAT HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY and today and forever. &gt;&gt; Now, sir, &gt;&gt; I have to be careful because brother Jonathan was was kind of dabbling in my in some of my thoughts that that I've been going into. Now, our brother, he was talking about that new land. Now, now we we think about this new land and God had brought us in had brought us out of the world and he brought us into a new land. everything that's been done, every miracle that's been performed, every healing on your body, every mind battle that God helped you go through, amen, on this earth is the evidence that there is a new land, AMEN, BEYOND THE JORDAN. AMEN. WHAT WE what we experience here IS JUST A TOUCH OF WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU IN THE YOUR PROMISED LAND. AMEN. YOU COULD JUST GO INTO IT IN 2026 AND KNOW THAT HE is there to meet your needs. God bless you. Amen, brother Kobe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I enjoyed that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we go to Jean? &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Harry gets ready to come, I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. Oh my. I see the promises. I see the promises in fulfillment. All over my life. All over. Sing that once again. I see the evidence. Oh, I see the evidence of you all my life. All over my life [Music] I see your promises in fulfillment all over my life. All over my life. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Let's turn to 1st Samuel chapter 13 and starting at verse 13. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done foolishly. Thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. For now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever. But now thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee. &gt;&gt; And let's turn to Acts chapter 13. Acts chapter 13 and verse 22. And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will. You know, I think that we could probably go for a solid year, if not longer, preaching on just David. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's so easy for most of us to look at David's life and identify ourselves somewhere in there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I think it's one of those where David is one of those uh characters in the Bible that we know the most about. &gt;&gt; You know, you can know I know a little bit about Daniel. I know a little bit about Jonah. I know a little bit about the disciples, &gt;&gt; but David, we know almost everything about him, it seems like. And we go through this and we can pull out nugget after nugget about his life and we can look at it and we can recognize ourselves in different parts going man I struggle with those same areas or I've faced those same kind of trials or I've been through those same things. &gt;&gt; You know David was a man of passion which was both good and bad in his life. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, it was good when he came to his brothers and ended up facing Goliath. He didn't come looking for a fight. He didn't come looking to join the army. He didn't react until he heard the challenge. &gt;&gt; Until he heard Goliath speaking out against the army of the living God. Suddenly, David had to respond. &gt;&gt; He was just coming to deliver food. &gt;&gt; He didn't go looking for the fight. He didn't go looking to join the army. He was going to go greet his brothers, find out how they were doing, and go home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the giant spoke out, and he heard the challenge, and it was a challenge against his God. &gt;&gt; And his passion rose up that this cannot stand. I have to go against that. &gt;&gt; His passion was good. And that it brought out his worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. that he was always there to to to worship. He was passionate for his God. &gt;&gt; But those same passions would come out to the negative as we saw him with a temper as we saw him, you know, most historians look at it and say that he was one that would battle depression. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that those that are great artists and great composers and great songwriters often battle depression. David falls into that category. He was one that he battled lust. &gt;&gt; This was one of his biggest failings. We all know this. This is common knowledge from reading the Bible and it's been preached on time and time again. His passions that could run so hot and that could make him be so passionate FOR HIS GOD COULD ALSO GET him into so much trouble. &gt;&gt; They could take him down the wrong road and they could lead him in to the wrong place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. He was passionate in a good way for his God and that he wouldn't strike the Lord's anointed. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Even though he knew that he had been anointed king, Saul was still alive and Saul was anointed. &gt;&gt; He would not strike the Lord's anointed. Even though his men told him that he should do it, &gt;&gt; and even though he had the opportunity two different times, &gt;&gt; he still wouldn't &gt;&gt; make that choice &gt;&gt; because he was still going, God anointed him. It's not by my hand that he'll be taken down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We know as brother John mentioned earlier that he was a man after God's own heart. And so often we'll hear our our Christian brothers and sisters that will say, "I want to be like that. I want to be recognized as a man or a woman after God's own heart." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; But yet there's something that we have to remember and that's David was in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; David was under the blood of bulls and goats. He was a shadow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and he was able to be a man after God's own heart. But at the same time, he was never freed of what he was struggling with. &gt;&gt; Those passions that were so much of a problem, he was never set free from those. That was something he had to continually battle and fight throughout his entire life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; he had to go through those struggles because he hadn't come to the perfect sacrifice yet. who was still just the shadow, just the type. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And now we can stand here. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And we're no longer under the blood of bulls and goats. We now have the perfect sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; As our brother mentioned, he took what we were supposed to have. &gt;&gt; He took my stripes. He took &gt;&gt; my nails. He took my thorns. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he gave me what he deserves. &gt;&gt; He came in and as brother Brandham would talk about in in adoption, he has brought us in and now he's given us that authority to where our name on the check is just as good as his name &gt;&gt; where when we come in and we can make the same business deals and stamp with the ring and we have just as much authority as God does. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have that authority. Brother &gt;&gt; in Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5, it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the sermon the spoken word is the original seed. He said they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head. Headship of Christ was his. Notice what harmony. Jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him first. Harmony between God and Christ. See John 5:19. So will the bride and he shows her his word of life. He shows her and she receives it. She never doubts it. Nothing can harm her, not even death. &gt;&gt; For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Amen. Then I got a great big hallelujah. Here's the secret. The word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name. She has thus sayeth the Lord. Then it is germmitized. So the Holy Spirit waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose. They do only his will. Amen. I'll believe that no one can persuade them different. They have thus sayaeth the Lord. Or they keep still. Then they will do the works of God, for it is himself in them, continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David was a man after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; He was working towards the goal. He was trying to get there. He could see the target up ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he kept running towards it. He kept trying to get there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he was under the blood of bulls and goats. &gt;&gt; He could only go so far. There was still a barrier that he couldn't cross. There was still a place he couldn't get to. It was always just out of his reach. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And God respected it that he wanted to get there, that he was trying, that he was quick to repent, as our brother talked about, that he was that he wanted &gt;&gt; Yeah. to be serving God to the best of his ability. He wanted to worship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But yet, we as the bride can stand here and we're not just men and women after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we now have that anointing on us. We now have the inddwelling. We now have &gt;&gt; we have now been sealed to where &gt;&gt; it is God living within us. It is now the very heart of Christ inside us. We're not trying to get there. It's in us and we're living it out. We're manifesting. We speak what he speaks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We use the same word that he does. We know his wants. We know his likes. WE KNOW WHAT HE DESIRES. And that is our very desire to live out what he wants. To live out how he instructs us. &gt;&gt; Amen. to manifest the same word that he spoke from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Godl &gt;&gt; in the church age book it says notice the harmony of the father and the son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father. John 5:19 the harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride. He shows her his word of life. She receives it. &gt;&gt; She never doubts it. Therefore nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; The bride has the mind of Christ, for she knows what he wants done with the word. She performs the command of the word in his name, for she has thus sayeth the Lord. Then the word is quickened by the spirit, and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest serving its purpose. &gt;&gt; We love to minister on David. We love to read about David. We love to identify ourselves because he's just so human. He's just so much like us. But God isn't calling us to be like David. &gt;&gt; God isn't calling us and going up here. Here's David. He is the ultimate goal of what you want to be. &gt;&gt; No, David was running. He was trying to get there. He was going after that heart of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But yet, God has come and opened up those seven seals and revealed his word to us and come to live inside the heart of his bride to identify himself with us to go, you are no longer brother Josh Martin. You are now Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You are no longer Luke Lancaster. &gt;&gt; You are Mrs. Jesus Christ. You are identified by a different name. You are given a different authority to where we no longer have to continue to battle the same things over and over like David did. &gt;&gt; David had to keep battling those passions over and over and over. &gt;&gt; But yet God gives us the overcoming power. God gives us the authority to say we don't have to continue to fight the same thing over and over again. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to stumble and fall. We're going to make mistakes. We're still human beings. We're still in this sinful flesh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But our desire at the very center &gt;&gt; is Christ's desire. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We want to live the way he tells us to. We want to manifest the word that he's spoken. We want to take his word and be living it on this earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; David was a man after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; God has called the bride to be so much more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are called &gt;&gt; I believe that &gt;&gt; to be the very heart of God. to be living the very word of God in this age &gt;&gt; and being Christ on earth at this time. &gt;&gt; Lord bless y'all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Can we stand to our feet now as brother Caleb comes and gets the um the mic set for the choir? Can we go to G?

[Music] Aren't you glad that Aren't you glad that you know the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; It's such a a wonderful thing. It's a treasure to know the Lord and to have this relationship with him. Listening to these messages that have been preached tonight, I tell you what a what a wonderful thing it is to have such a wonderful rich word. You can be seated here for a few moments. We're fixing to have communion. Have you enjoyed yourself this evening? &gt;&gt; We've got 27 28 minutes before the turn of the new year and um we truly have been blessed. I thinking of our our brother Sam and sister Bethany as they just had their house catch on fire and and and how gracious God was to you all and how it could have been such a tragic thing and God got you all out and &gt;&gt; you know how how you know no one even knows this. I just not even all my family uh I was driving that old dump truck the other day and and um you know it's always had been a little rough on brakes and but I've always I've been able to stop it. you know, I've got my using using the the the brakes and then my my pedal or my my emergency brake and and um so I putt putt down to get gravel and bring it back and then I had some of Caleb and Tina's kids with me and and um as we're coming into we we come into town, I've got a load of gravel and um my brakes gave out. We're at the train tracks and um tracks are the the the deals are down and I'm I'm I'm grinding my gears. I'm doing everything I can. I can't there's there's no stopping. There's no stopping. I had a car in front of me. And if I hit the car, I' I'd push it out. I could hear the train blaring. All this is all going on. And I um I I I'm grinding my gears trying to I you know, I'm trying to get it down into granny and I can't get it. And so I just made the decision, you know. I I just I just drop it down into second and push it with everything I've got. And u busted through the barriers and u that train train came right just just right behind me. I stopped once I was able to get it stopped. I thought I was just shaking like, you know, you go up the hill as you're as you go across those tracks and I I just let her rope to a stop and I just I mean I I looked at her it it was it was bad. [Music] I just had Fresa come come pick us up. And uh as I looked there and I thought, God, if it hadn't been for your grace, if it hadn't been for your grace, [Music] &gt;&gt; things don't always we sometimes we don't we we just don't give God the credit that he deserves. [Music] And I I just I I just want us to stop and think. I mean, that was close. That I mean, that that Duck on it. It Listen, guys. I mean, we we're we're talking about seconds. We're It was close. And I was so shaken for days. I just nightmares, you know, but ultimately God, God has been good to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we go into this new year, I think we should go in with confidence. I I I like I like the way Brother Harry brought that out. Under the old law of bulls and goats there there was no Holy Ghost. There was no overcoming power. There was over the sin nature. But through the blood of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost can come upon us and he can give us victory over those things in our lives. &gt;&gt; I want to live pure before him and honest before him. &gt;&gt; That's right. as we get ready for communion. And as we read it here, what we're going to do is is um fixing to have you to just come up through the through the center aisle here and then we'll um each each of your families, you can come and take communion. But 1 Corinthians 11 and23, I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body that is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. [Music] This do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause are many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. But if we would judge ourselves, we should be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we be not condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together in condemnation. The rest I will set in order when I come. So, as we look here and we are are coming into take communion. I think these brothers have brought it out. These these were every one of these were just absolute masterpieces tonight. Brother Brother Ben, what a blessing. What a blessing. you other brothers, the gifts of God that you have expressed tonight, it you're a blessing to the body of Christ. We need you, men. We need these gifts because if there's ever anything that we need, the bride's got to be free from condemnation. And if this message ever needed to be preached loud and declared strong, &gt;&gt; it needs to be declared today that he lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so as we as we get ready, I I want my heart I I I want us to judge our hearts here tonight as and we can start lining up because we don't have much time. We got 20 minutes. So we can start lining up here in the middle by your families. I if if you've not if you've not been born again then we would rather you not take the communion. This is only for the for the born again those who have following Christ full of the Holy Ghost. And uh I I wonder um brother brother Sam, why don't you and your wife come? Would you would you come and serve communion to me and then I'll my wife and then I'll serve. Sister Bethany, you come with him. We're we're so thankful for brother Sam and and brother Jonathan coming and and being a part. wives coming with them. The bread is right here. And so we will uh we're going to pray over it right now. Let's let's pray. Lord Jesus, we just ask Lord that you would take this bread. [Music] We ask Lord that as there is nothing this wine or bread that could ever save us. This is simply symbolic of your grace to us. I pray Lord Jesus that you would bless it. Lord, may may this representation may there be as fresh anointing fall as your blood was shed on Calvary for us as you your flesh was torn for us. We take Lord, we take your blood, we take your word and we apply it to our lives. forgive us of our sins and our wrongs and let us live for you this coming year in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. And what we want to do, mama, if you would just step back and I'm just going to serve you and your wife. Oh God, [Music] I know my heart. &gt;&gt; Bless my sister &gt;&gt; today. [Music] Try me.
