[35:42] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[35:45] uncertainty so fight I not as one that
[35:48] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[35:51] and bring it into subjection lest that
[35:54] by any means when I have preached to
[35:55] others I myself should be a cast pass
[35:59] away let's go ahead and go before the
[36:03] Lord Lord Jesus we come into your
[36:05] presence this evening Lord and Lord I
[36:08] pray that you would just be the one to
[36:10] to take control of this service Lord
[36:12] Jesus we lord we've we've worshiped you
[36:16] and praised you Lord and Lord though as
[36:20] far less than what you would deserve
[36:23] Lord I pray that you would accept those
[36:25] those those songs and the worship Lord
[36:27] Jesus and Lord may you just come down
[36:30] and and minister to your people Lord
[36:32] they Lord they've come with expectation
[36:35] Lord that that you would have something
[36:37] to to say to each one of them and Lord
[36:39] they didn't come to to hear me or hear
[36:41] any particular man that would be
[36:43] standing behind this Pulpit Lord but
[36:45] they came to hear you Lord and Lord I
[36:47] pray that you would just be the one to
[36:49] to take control Lord that you would Lord
[36:51] put together these these jumbled notes
[36:53] and jumbled thoughts Lord and Lord may
[36:55] you be the one to to speak and minister
[36:58] to every one of us Lord myself included
[37:01] Lord we
[37:02] just commit the remainder of the service
[37:04] into your hands in the name of Lord
[37:06] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may all
[37:09] have your
[37:15] seats so we have all probably heard
[37:18] multiple sermons preached over the years
[37:23] about the Christian life being erase
[37:28] and I'm sure there are going to be
[37:30] plenty of things that I would say that
[37:32] you've heard
[37:34] before at this point so many of you know
[37:37] at this point we've read through these
[37:39] scriptures so many times that I
[37:41] shouldn't be telling you a whole lot
[37:43] that's new U maybe it's just trying to
[37:45] bring back to our memory some of the the
[37:48] things that we've read or that we've
[37:50] heard over the
[37:52] years but you know I started thinking
[37:56] about this and um it just so happened
[37:59] that it coincided with the fact that you
[38:02] know we just had the Olympics complete
[38:05] and you had all of these athletes that
[38:07] were gathering together to uh comp
[38:11] compete for their country to try to win
[38:14] these these races and you know I've
[38:16] always found it interesting that there
[38:18] there're really two different types of
[38:20] Runners you know when you look in um
[38:23] they look majorly different you know you
[38:27] have the one group of runter that
[38:29] they're the sprinters yeah they do the
[38:31] short distance they do it so quickly and
[38:33] if you look at any one of them they all
[38:35] look like they have been hitting the
[38:36] weight bench a lot they're all really
[38:39] big beefy guys they have lots of muscles
[38:43] and you can even go down from to the the
[38:47] the physical side the medical side they
[38:49] have more fast twitch muscles they are
[38:52] designed for Speed this is this is what
[38:54] they're able to do and this is what they
[38:55] have maximized where if you watch the
[38:58] runners that are distance Runners those
[38:59] that are running 5,000 m 10,000 M
[39:02] marathoners all this they are lean they
[39:06] are skinny they look like they have no
[39:09] extra fat no extra muscle anywhere on
[39:11] their body they're as close to Skin and
[39:13] Bones as you can get and still be
[39:16] healthy and they are just so lean but
[39:19] they can go and go and go and those
[39:24] sprinters might be able to get out fast
[39:27] but if you have to go a distance the
[39:29] sprinters aren't going to get there yeah
[39:32] they're going to fall off pretty quick
[39:36] they can cover their their short
[39:37] distance but they're not going to keep
[39:39] going but these these lean guys that
[39:42] have worked off everything else just
[39:45] keep going and they have these slow
[39:47] twitch muscles that allow them to to go
[39:50] through the the distance that they're
[39:53] not always the fastest Off the Mark
[39:55] they're not always going to have the the
[39:57] best start but they're going to keep
[40:00] going and they're going to finish well
[40:01] at the end yeah where with the sprinters
[40:04] yes they it's all about in winning a
[40:06] Sprint a lot so much it's about that
[40:09] good start did you take off really well
[40:12] were you able to get a good push off the
[40:14] block or did you have this good starting
[40:17] position because that start is what
[40:19] often will make or break the race where
[40:22] with the distant
[40:24] Runners if you fall down in the first
[40:26] 100 feet it really doesn't matter you
[40:28] can get right back up you're going to
[40:30] keep going you're going miles yeah so
[40:34] falling in a couple hundred feet is not
[40:36] going to affect you a whole lot tripping
[40:39] stumbling these different things they're
[40:41] not going to greatly affect the marathon
[40:44] or they're not going to greatly affect
[40:45] the one that is Going the Distance yeah
[40:49] because they have time to recover they
[40:51] have time to keep going they have time
[40:53] to keep pushing through it
[40:57] let's go to Philippians chapter
[41:01] 3 Philippians chapter 3 and verse
[41:14] 13 Brethren I count not myself to have
[41:17] apprehended but this one thing I do
[41:20] forgetting those things which are behind
[41:22] and reaching forth unto those things
[41:24] which are before I press toward the mark
[41:27] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[41:30] in Christ
[41:33] Jesus for these distance Runners if they
[41:36] fall if they stumble if they trip if
[41:38] they whatever they're not going to get
[41:40] up and spend the entire rest of the race
[41:43] beating themselves up and going how in
[41:45] the world could I have stumbled there
[41:48] okay okay cuz there's time to recover
[41:51] there's time for them to keep coming if
[41:52] they spend all their time thinking about
[41:55] I can't believe I stumbled in the first
[41:56] 50 fet or in the first 100
[42:00] ft it's not going to help them as
[42:02] they're going towards the end they have
[42:04] to lay aside any thoughts of well maybe
[42:07] I didn't start quite as fast as I wanted
[42:10] or maybe I did this wrong or did that
[42:12] wrong they're focused on where they're
[42:14] going they're focused on what the uh
[42:17] what the finish line is they're focused
[42:19] on the end
[42:20] result now that doesn't mean that they
[42:22] don't kick themselves because they did
[42:25] trip or stumble or whatever
[42:28] but they have to quickly lay it
[42:30] aside and be focused on this is where
[42:33] I'm
[42:34] going and when they're out there running
[42:36] these are not once again these are not
[42:38] you have this huge difference in races
[42:39] on the ones that are doing the sprinting
[42:41] these are races that are done in seconds
[42:44] or
[42:45] minutes where this other one these are
[42:47] races that are done in
[42:51] hours we're talking you know when you
[42:53] look at the times for
[42:56] marathons 3 hours 4
[43:00] hours is a more normal time you can get
[43:03] the really competitive guys that go
[43:05] faster than that but 3 to four hours and
[43:08] they normally have cut offs at somewhere
[43:09] around 6 to seven hours if you go beyond
[43:11] that you're not finishing they're
[43:13] cutting you off because they have to get
[43:15] the roads back open
[43:16] on but they do this is for hours and so
[43:21] a momentary mess up of a few
[43:23] seconds is not going to throw everything
[43:25] out of proportion okay if you ever watch
[43:29] video of people finishing
[43:32] marathons it's normally not whoever's
[43:35] finishing out in front there's normally
[43:37] not a group of them together there is
[43:39] normally large gaps between people that
[43:42] are finishing you may have a small group
[43:44] of okay here was two that came together
[43:46] or three that came together but
[43:48] generally these are huge large distances
[43:52] between
[43:53] people and so these momentary changes
[43:55] these momentary
[43:57] mistakes or mess ups they may have had
[44:00] didn't have a huge effect for the
[44:03] end What mattered was whether they kept
[44:05] going whether they kept running whether
[44:06] they kept their focus on the goal that
[44:10] they were going
[44:12] to let's go to Hebrews chapter
[44:19] 12 Hebrews chap 12 and verse 1
[44:30] wherefore seeing we are also compassed
[44:32] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[44:35] let us lay aside every weight and the
[44:37] sin which doth so easily beset us and
[44:40] let us one run with patience the race
[44:42] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[44:45] the author and finisher of our faith who
[44:48] for the joy that was set before him
[44:50] endured the cross despising the shame
[44:52] and is set down at the right hand of the
[44:55] Throne of God
[44:58] brother brandom as he's praying in the
[44:59] sermon perfect strength by Perfect
[45:01] weakness he says our gracious loving
[45:03] father we humbly approach thy Throne
[45:06] this morning in the name of Jesus thy
[45:08] son to offer prayer for ourselves and
[45:10] for
[45:11] others thou would first Lord forgive us
[45:13] of all of our trespasses and our
[45:15] iniquity and then we would pray for
[45:17] others Lord that they also would be
[45:20] forgiven and thy Church would be drawn
[45:22] closer to thee for truly Lord in our
[45:24] heart we believe that you are ready to
[45:26] work a work with with your church ready
[45:28] to take it out of the world and be
[45:29] translated into the kingdom of God but
[45:32] Lord help us make ourselves ready for
[45:34] that hour may this morning be the time
[45:36] Lord that from one up to all of us will
[45:39] lay aside every weight and the sin that
[45:41] so easily beset us that we might run
[45:44] with patience the race that's set before
[45:49] us Lord Romans
[45:53] 12 starting at verse one it says I
[45:55] beseech you therefore bre
[45:57] by the mercies of God that you present
[45:59] your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[46:02] acceptable unto God which is your
[46:04] reasonable service and be not conformed
[46:07] to this world but be ye transformed by
[46:09] the renewing of your mind that you may
[46:12] prove what is that good and acceptable
[46:14] and perfect will of
[46:21] God so Paul as he's writing to the
[46:23] Hebrews is
[46:25] saying lay aside every weight lay aside
[46:29] all the sin and everything that would
[46:32] hold you up that would slow you down
[46:34] that would weigh you down that would
[46:36] keep you from covering the distance that
[46:38] you're going
[46:41] through and then he says as he's writing
[46:43] to the Romans be not conformed to this
[46:47] world okay you know we have a world
[46:52] where normally the mindset is to gather
[46:55] as much stuff as you can
[46:58] to have as many things as many it's now
[47:02] I mean it's hit to the point now
[47:05] where people that are trying to do
[47:07] different and do what's called
[47:10] minimalist living is like this is a
[47:13] thing people follow this people have to
[47:14] learn how to do this how can I live like
[47:18] a
[47:20] minimalist it's a short answer get rid
[47:23] of
[47:24] stuff I mean there shouldn't be
[47:26] something that they have to do lessons
[47:29] for minimal means
[47:31] less go in your closet throw out some
[47:34] clothes we're moving in the right
[47:35] direction you know get rid of some of
[47:38] the toys that you haven't touched for
[47:40] however long or the tools that have been
[47:42] in your garage for who knows how long
[47:45] that you bought for a single project and
[47:48] is now there Gathering dust or get rid
[47:51] of this or get rid of that but you can
[47:53] go on and you can find articles all over
[47:56] the internet you can find books written
[47:58] about how to live a minimalist life yeah
[48:03] this is what you have to do
[48:06] yeah this should be pretty basic this
[48:09] should be pretty easy but we live in a
[48:12] world where everything is about how do I
[48:14] get
[48:15] more how do I get more things more stuff
[48:19] more popularity more wealth more this
[48:22] more
[48:24] that okay we live in the world
[48:28] where buffets were the biggest thing in
[48:30] the world until Co but until then it was
[48:33] all about how do I get more I want to go
[48:36] to the restaurant that gives me the
[48:37] biggest portions I want to go to the
[48:38] restaurant that gives me the most food I
[48:40] want to go to the place that gives me
[48:42] the most of whatever I'm
[48:46] getting I don't and so often it's I
[48:49] really don't care if it's a little bit
[48:50] less quality as long as there's more of
[48:51] it we're okay this is good it's just
[48:54] more yeah that's the mindset that's the
[48:58] world that we live in it's all about
[49:03] more and all too often we can allow that
[49:05] to creep into our spiritual lives as
[49:08] well to go okay more is always
[49:14] better and so what if I learn from this
[49:17] resource and this resource and this
[49:20] resource why is it that we have to have
[49:23] message ministers that are up here
[49:24] telling us we don't need to pay atten
[49:26] pay attention to what Dr Dobson says or
[49:28] we don't have to pay attention to this
[49:30] or pay attention to
[49:32] that because we're in this more
[49:35] mentality okay so if there's somebody
[49:38] that is Christian that is talking about
[49:42] a subject then I should probably listen
[49:45] to what they have to say I should read
[49:46] their book I should listen to their
[49:47] podcast I should do this I should do
[49:49] that I should have
[49:52] more I'm not going to say that you can't
[49:55] get something good
[49:57] out of what they have to
[50:00] say there are probably lessons that we
[50:02] could take from Dr Dobson that are fine
[50:06] I'm not saying he's telling you evil
[50:08] things I'm not saying any of these
[50:10] people out there are telling you things
[50:11] that are absolutely
[50:13] wrong but so often we have that more
[50:16] mentality of well yes I listen to my
[50:20] pastor and maybe I listen to a message
[50:23] this month but I'm going to make sure I
[50:25] listen to this podcast every day I'm
[50:26] listen to this person every day or
[50:28] listen to that or listen to that or read
[50:30] this book or do this and I'm going to
[50:32] fill everything
[50:33] up right and it's
[50:38] more and it's this more
[50:41] mentality but yet Paul is telling us we
[50:43] have to lay aside the
[50:47] weights okay yes and yes he goes he then
[50:51] specifically says and the sin that so
[50:52] easily besets but he doesn't start off
[50:55] by just saying lay aside the sin he's
[50:56] like lay aside the
[50:58] weight there are things that start to
[51:00] cling to you that are just start to be
[51:03] noise that just start to be things that
[51:06] true they might not be bad but they're
[51:10] distractions we all know our human
[51:13] brains Can Only Hold so
[51:16] much we start to forget things we start
[51:20] to not be able to remember this because
[51:24] we're trying so so focused on trying to
[51:26] remember remember this and as we go
[51:29] through we fill our minds with all these
[51:32] kinds of
[51:33] things you know whether
[51:36] it's for me I've done a lot of I've
[51:40] listened to read a lot of books and
[51:42] listen a lot of things about leadership
[51:44] within the Chick-fil-A world because
[51:46] Chick-fil-A is really big on leadership
[51:48] and being able to work with your teams
[51:49] and different things and so I've read
[51:51] books by different people I've listened
[51:54] to podcasts I do this I do that
[51:57] and I can learn a lot of Leadership
[52:00] Lessons and they're good there's nothing
[52:03] bad about
[52:05] them but it's easy to start getting the
[52:07] point where I'm remembering more of
[52:10] that and less of the scriptures or less
[52:13] of what the prophet
[52:15] said yes and the Leadership
[52:18] Lessons From these great speakers are
[52:21] not going to be the things that get me
[52:23] into heaven they're not going to be the
[52:25] things that help me overcome the
[52:27] struggles I have in my life they're not
[52:29] going to be the things that help
[52:32] me get through life it may help me be
[52:36] successful in my job it may help me be
[52:38] successful working with the people that
[52:40] I have
[52:43] there but is it going to help me in the
[52:45] more important
[52:46] things is it going to help me actually
[52:49] do the other stuff
[52:57] to conform is to be similar in form or
[53:00] type to
[53:05] agree and we're Paul tells us that we
[53:08] are not to be conformed to the world we
[53:11] are supposed to be standing out we're
[53:14] supposed to be
[53:15] different same thing as when you're
[53:18] looking at these two different types of
[53:21] Runners to use this as the type I would
[53:23] say that most of the world are
[53:27] sprinters in this that they're all about
[53:29] they're going to get bulked up they're
[53:31] going to be able to do things fast in a
[53:34] short
[53:35] distance but yet God is calling us to be
[53:38] the marathoners God is calling us to be
[53:40] the distance Runners God is calling us
[53:41] to be able to keep going and keep
[53:47] pushing and there are two different
[53:48] mindsets there two different ways of
[53:50] training there are two different ways of
[53:52] eating there are two different ways of
[53:54] living
[53:56] you're not going to find the sprinters
[53:58] and the marathoners in the gym together
[54:01] you're not going to find them out on the
[54:03] track training
[54:05] together you're not normally not even
[54:07] going to find them like at the same
[54:09] restaurants they're going for different
[54:12] they have different needs because of
[54:14] what they're trying to accomplish okay
[54:17] right the world is out to get everything
[54:21] they can right now to get all the
[54:22] enjoyment they can right
[54:25] now where we have the goal to get
[54:29] somewhere
[54:30] else our goal isn't to gain everything
[54:33] we can right now and be able to enjoy
[54:36] every moment we have here on this Earth
[54:38] our goal is to get to heaven our goal is
[54:43] to get to our Savior our goal is to get
[54:45] out of this world and so we're not
[54:48] trying to gather everything we can here
[54:50] we're not trying to bulk up with the
[54:54] world's vitamins and the world's
[54:56] minerals
[54:58] we're trying to do a different diet
[54:59] we're trying to go for a different
[55:02] Target they're looking at a Finish Line
[55:04] that to them is the end of a
[55:08] lifetime we're looking at a finish line
[55:10] that goes beyond our life
[55:15] time when you look at what the world
[55:18] focuses on and pays attention
[55:22] to there was a Gallup poll in 2022
[55:26] that showed a record low 20% of
[55:29] Americans now say the Bible is the
[55:31] literal word of
[55:33] God which is down from 24% when the
[55:36] question was last asked in
[55:40] 2017 when the poll breaks down you have
[55:42] basically three answers you have 20% of
[55:46] those polled say that the Bible is the
[55:49] literal word of
[55:50] God you have
[55:54] 29% that say the Bible is just a
[55:56] collection of fables Legends history and
[55:58] moral precepts recorded by
[56:01] man and then you have the largest group
[56:05] 49% that say the Bible is inspired by
[56:10] God but not to be taken
[56:18] literally in Time
[56:21] magazine in February of this year
[56:29] in an article written by Emily
[56:32] bisos says people are tired like really
[56:37] tired as evidenced by recent Trends such
[56:40] as quiet quitting coffee badging bare
[56:43] minimum Mondays and most of all the
[56:45] great resignation when over 47 million
[56:48] Americans voluntary voluntarily resigned
[56:51] from their positions people are feeling
[56:53] a strain on more than just their work
[56:54] calendars they're feeling it on their
[56:57] Spirits we're now in the area of we're
[57:00] now in the era of the great exhaustion
[57:02] what writer and computer science
[57:04] Professor Cal Newton has called a time
[57:06] when people are looking to reestablish
[57:08] their relationship with work in order to
[57:10] reduce their pervasive sense of
[57:13] drain in the article she goes on to list
[57:16] three main reasons why people are
[57:18] tired the first one is unsustainable
[57:22] Lifestyles the second reason is stress
[57:24] that is out of their control and the
[57:26] third is financial
[57:34] insecurity I work with some of these
[57:36] people that I guarantee would have given
[57:39] the exact same answers because there are
[57:41] a few people that I go to
[57:42] work and every single day when I ask him
[57:45] hey how you
[57:46] doing their immediate answer is
[57:50] tired the day just started I mean I'm
[57:54] getting there at 7 in the morning yeah
[57:57] and I understand some days 7 in the
[57:58] morning is rough other days it's fine
[58:01] but there's some days where I can go
[58:03] okay I understand being tired but this
[58:05] is the same shift you work every day
[58:07] surely there's a point where your body
[58:08] starts to go okay this is normal but
[58:11] their answer never changes I've been
[58:13] working with them for a year or more now
[58:17] and it's still the same yeah every
[58:19] single day how you doing today
[58:23] tired there have been a few days where I
[58:25] went in and I went
[58:27] brother Coe how you doing today and
[58:28] before he could even answer
[58:30] tired I just answer for him CU I know
[58:33] what's coming I know what they're going
[58:34] to
[58:42] say we live in a
[58:45] world where people
[58:48] are
[58:49] tired they are worn out they are
[58:53] stressed they are
[58:57] unsure of what's going to happen
[59:00] next and to me this is one of the places
[59:02] where the Christian Life should be
[59:05] standing out as a witness sure there are
[59:08] going to be days where we are tired we
[59:11] didn't sleep
[59:12] well hey I've got a baby and a toddler
[59:16] that have decided to get their sleep
[59:18] schedules all messed up in the past
[59:21] month or so there are days I am tired I
[59:24] know there are lots of days my wife is
[59:25] tired
[59:27] she has to deal with them more than I
[59:28] do but there there's it's we're going
[59:31] through a season and there is a reason
[59:33] to be tired there's a physical reason
[59:36] we're not getting as much sleep as we're
[59:38] used to yeah so we're
[59:40] tired
[59:42] okay they will grow out of this the
[59:44] season will
[59:46] end yeah we will get out of and even now
[59:50] there's a good day or a good night where
[59:53] they slept well and the next morning
[59:55] we're not as tired we're okay we're good
[59:58] but it's still it's a season it's not
[1:00:00] something where for the rest of my life
[1:00:02] I don't continually always say I'm
[1:00:09] tired but yet people all around us are
[1:00:16] tired they are continually stressed they
[1:00:19] were continually
[1:00:21] upset and as
[1:00:23] Christians we're not in that place
[1:00:27] yes we may go through a
[1:00:29] season we have different ones as we
[1:00:33] were as we were praying over them this
[1:00:36] morning the different ones that have
[1:00:37] been battling sickness or dealing with
[1:00:40] these different things they're going
[1:00:42] through Seasons
[1:00:43] where even spiritually I guarantee they
[1:00:47] are feeling
[1:00:48] tired sister Denise has been battling
[1:00:51] this high blood pressure for some time
[1:00:54] this has been going on and where
[1:00:56] physically she's
[1:00:59] tired but I'm sure that there's some
[1:01:01] emotional and spiritual draining to
[1:01:03] where she feels tired because of this
[1:01:07] she's been going through
[1:01:09] things we can look at brother Duran as
[1:01:12] he goes through and he has the days
[1:01:14] where he's more weary more tired his
[1:01:17] body isn't wanting to work the way that
[1:01:19] he wants it to he's struggling with
[1:01:22] these different
[1:01:24] things brother Mitch has been struggling
[1:01:26] with his own things there are days where
[1:01:27] he's
[1:01:29] tired and not just physically I'm sure
[1:01:33] there are days where he feels it
[1:01:34] emotionally and feels it spiritually
[1:01:37] where it comes on more and he has this
[1:01:39] going on and we live in a world
[1:01:43] where their answer for almost all of
[1:01:46] this is to find some way to numb the
[1:01:53] tiredness it's one of the reasons
[1:01:56] that people will turn to
[1:01:59] alcohol or people will turn
[1:02:02] to different
[1:02:04] drugs even the ones that they now want
[1:02:07] to call is okay this is medically okay
[1:02:09] you can do the the medical marijuana
[1:02:11] it's not too
[1:02:12] bad and you know and they'll go into all
[1:02:14] the debates about it doesn't lead into
[1:02:16] anything else doesn't do whatever I'm
[1:02:18] not even going to try to argue that
[1:02:20] that's
[1:02:21] fine but what it does do is it gets you
[1:02:24] used to being numbed
[1:02:26] it gets you used to not having to feel
[1:02:29] the pain or not have to feel the stress
[1:02:31] or not have to feel the
[1:02:35] problems and that's where the danger
[1:02:37] comes in because Satan is all about
[1:02:39] trying to get you to be numb and not
[1:02:43] feel
[1:02:44] it you know when you have Runners that
[1:02:48] are that are
[1:02:49] training it's actually dangerous for
[1:02:53] them often to take pain
[1:02:57] medication because if they are
[1:02:59] continuing to train while using the pain
[1:03:01] medication they can often hurt
[1:03:04] themselves worse because they're not
[1:03:07] feeling
[1:03:08] it for particularly those that are doing
[1:03:11] distance running or these more extreme
[1:03:13] type of
[1:03:15] sports if they take anything they want
[1:03:17] to take the lightest possible just to
[1:03:19] take the edge off because they need to
[1:03:21] still feel how their body is responding
[1:03:24] they need to know as they're running if
[1:03:26] that knee is starting to give out so
[1:03:29] that they can stop before they do
[1:03:31] further damage or if that tendon or that
[1:03:33] muscle or that
[1:03:35] whatever they can't just be popping I'm
[1:03:38] going to take all the pain pills in the
[1:03:39] world just so I can keep
[1:03:40] going they have to keep feeling it or
[1:03:44] they're going to do more damage to
[1:03:46] themselves they're going to hurt
[1:03:47] themselves
[1:03:49] more but the world doesn't like hearing
[1:03:51] that they don't like hearing that hey we
[1:03:53] have to sometimes feel some struggles
[1:03:56] we have to feel some
[1:03:58] pain and so we live in a world that they
[1:04:01] want to automatically numb everything
[1:04:03] they want to take the
[1:04:06] route even if it's the mind-numbing
[1:04:08] route of I'm going to watch TV or scroll
[1:04:13] Facebook or Instagram or whatever and
[1:04:15] spend hours and hours doing it yeah yeah
[1:04:21] I saw the term a month or two back for
[1:04:24] the first time that I'd ever heard it
[1:04:26] and it applies to these different social
[1:04:28] media channels and it's called Doom
[1:04:31] scrolling and especially applies to the
[1:04:34] different social medias that have very
[1:04:36] short video
[1:04:37] clips it came out with Tik Tok to begin
[1:04:40] with but now you have Instagram and
[1:04:42] Facebook that all have the same kind of
[1:04:44] thing and doom scrolling is where you
[1:04:46] start off watching this one 30 second
[1:04:49] video or minute long or whatever it is
[1:04:53] and you scroll to the next one and then
[1:04:55] scroll to the next one and scroll to the
[1:04:57] next one and
[1:04:59] where a person wouldn't have given the
[1:05:02] wouldn't have taken the time to watch a
[1:05:04] 30 minute or hourong video they find
[1:05:08] themselves spending even more time stuck
[1:05:11] in the Doom
[1:05:13] scrolling right where they wouldn't have
[1:05:16] gone oh yeah I don't I'm not going to
[1:05:18] spend an hour on my phone I wouldn't sit
[1:05:20] here and watch this whole hourong video
[1:05:22] but they'll sit there and doom scroll
[1:05:25] short video clips over and over and over
[1:05:29] which will then become hours and hours
[1:05:33] okay and there'll be videos of all kinds
[1:05:35] of stuff so you can't even say I was
[1:05:37] focused on one subject and I learned
[1:05:38] something or did whatever it's you know
[1:05:42] however the algorithm randomizes it
[1:05:44] that's what they just watched for an
[1:05:47] hour or whatever yeah and just the name
[1:05:51] behind it should immediately put
[1:05:53] everyone on guard it's called Doom
[1:05:54] scrolling
[1:05:56] you are stuck in a circle of Doom That
[1:05:59] Never Ends it's not like okay I watched
[1:06:02] a 30- minute video there is a beginning
[1:06:03] and an ending I'm
[1:06:05] done with this Doom scrolling the
[1:06:08] algorithm keeps feeding you
[1:06:10] more it's not going to go at 30 minutes
[1:06:12] ah you're done I'm cutting you off
[1:06:13] you're finished it's like oh you want to
[1:06:15] flip to another one great here's the
[1:06:17] next one for you here's the next one for
[1:06:19] you here's the next one and just keep
[1:06:23] filling up the time keep
[1:06:25] in you to what's going on around because
[1:06:28] you're distracted and focused on these
[1:06:30] other
[1:06:33] things Galatians 5 and: 7 ye did run
[1:06:37] well who did hinder you that you should
[1:06:40] not obey the
[1:06:45] truth you did run well you started
[1:06:50] well you got off the block quickly you
[1:06:52] were moving down but then something
[1:06:56] stopped you something hindered you
[1:06:58] something kept you from continuing down
[1:07:00] the
[1:07:02] road and there's some sort of weight
[1:07:06] that you picked up along the way or
[1:07:10] maybe that you had from the beginning
[1:07:12] that you just forgot to drop or whatever
[1:07:14] but something came along and kept you
[1:07:17] from going down the road the way that
[1:07:18] you
[1:07:20] should and maybe that was just we
[1:07:23] started going through a tough season
[1:07:26] dealing with whatever issue may be
[1:07:29] coming on whatever battle the devil
[1:07:31] threw at us to go through right
[1:07:34] now some struggle
[1:07:37] some test or trial that came along
[1:07:40] that's making us stumble a little bit or
[1:07:44] making us feel like we have a little
[1:07:45] more weight to carry
[1:07:48] where and it's pushing us towards that
[1:07:50] tired
[1:07:54] part we're not always you know what what
[1:07:57] hinders us is not automatically that
[1:07:58] there's
[1:07:59] sin yes there could be and yes you need
[1:08:03] to check up to see is there something I
[1:08:04] need to get rid of but it could also be
[1:08:07] you're just going through a rough time
[1:08:09] in your life you're going through a test
[1:08:13] you're going through a trial and that is
[1:08:15] hindering you it's like running through
[1:08:17] mud you can keep moving or running on
[1:08:20] the sand on the
[1:08:23] beach used to live in Florida
[1:08:26] I've done that a few times it's not
[1:08:31] fun not enjoyable at all not unless you
[1:08:35] get down right by the water where it's
[1:08:36] packed in nice then you can do something
[1:08:38] but in the just nice grainy
[1:08:42] sand I have zero desire to run in
[1:08:45] that but something is going on that is
[1:08:49] that is hindering you that is slowing
[1:08:50] you down that is slowing down the
[1:08:53] progress okay
[1:08:56] Galatians chapter 6 and verse 9 let us
[1:08:59] not be weary and well-doing for in due
[1:09:01] season we shall reap if we faint not as
[1:09:04] we have therefore opportunity let us do
[1:09:06] good unto all men especially unto them
[1:09:09] who are of the household of
[1:09:20] faith and 2 Thessalonians 3 and: 13 says
[1:09:25] the the same thing but ye Brethren be
[1:09:26] not weary in well-doing
[1:09:31] in the sermon what does thou hear
[1:09:36] brother brandom says you know people
[1:09:38] under the juniper tree is like Elijah
[1:09:40] they like to sleep I preach to more
[1:09:43] tired people than anybody in the world
[1:09:45] people are so tired they they're so
[1:09:47] mentally strained until they're filling
[1:09:50] the insane institutions in the hospitals
[1:09:52] everywhere they went in such a nervous
[1:09:55] condition until they don't know what
[1:09:56] they do believe and what they want
[1:09:59] they're just laying there they don't
[1:10:00] know what to do oh it's such a sad sight
[1:10:04] listen here my brother you can't drink
[1:10:05] it off you can't shout it off neither
[1:10:07] can you play cards till it's dull you
[1:10:10] could take a thousand csas and try to
[1:10:11] sleep it off and you can't do
[1:10:13] it all of our little remedies only thing
[1:10:17] it does is help the symptoms we've got
[1:10:19] to have a cure for the disease we got to
[1:10:22] have all the psychiatrists in the world
[1:10:24] cannot cure it it only helps the
[1:10:26] symptoms okay the Cure is in the blood
[1:10:28] of Jesus Christ not take a rest at the
[1:10:30] seashore not go get an Anthem acquire to
[1:10:33] sing anthems that's what we're trying to
[1:10:35] do today sing it
[1:10:38] off and in the sermon the testimony of a
[1:10:41] true
[1:10:42] witness brother brandom says heal the
[1:10:45] sick that's in our midst this morning
[1:10:47] for we realize Lord that a tired weary
[1:10:49] sick body dragging around cannot enjoy
[1:10:52] the blessings of God as they could if
[1:10:54] they were well
[1:10:56] and we realize as Christians that we
[1:10:57] live so far under our privileges that
[1:11:00] you do not desire us to be like that
[1:11:02] tired and weary and run down and
[1:11:03] weakening you desire us to be filled
[1:11:05] with the spirit of God grant that to us
[1:11:08] Lord as we wait further for your message
[1:11:11] in Jesus name we ask it
[1:11:16] amen you know they can write their
[1:11:18] articles today talking about how there
[1:11:20] people are more tired than ever before
[1:11:22] in
[1:11:23] America but yet our Prophet already said
[1:11:25] it said I preach to more tired
[1:11:28] people than ever
[1:11:31] before this isn't something new even
[1:11:35] though the world is now diagnosing it as
[1:11:37] this is new this is different this is
[1:11:40] just part of going through
[1:11:44] life you know when you look at distance
[1:11:47] Runners they don't get to the end of the
[1:11:51] marathon and then stand there breathing
[1:11:54] easy like they've done done
[1:11:56] nothing even the best in the world when
[1:11:58] they get to the end of a distance
[1:12:02] Marathon a lot of them almost fall over
[1:12:05] when they get past the
[1:12:07] end this is not you know what people
[1:12:10] would say is light work or something
[1:12:12] this is an effort this is a strain it
[1:12:15] takes a
[1:12:16] lot to accomplish this kind of goal
[1:12:20] right so many people in the world will
[1:12:22] put this on their bucket list type thing
[1:12:25] of I'm going to complete a
[1:12:27] marathon one day this is what I'm going
[1:12:29] to do because this is a major
[1:12:32] achievement if I was able to run that
[1:12:35] far and complete it under the time
[1:12:38] prescribed I have done something I have
[1:12:41] accomplished
[1:12:43] something and in any type of
[1:12:46] Sport AS athletes are training as they
[1:12:49] are working as they're going through
[1:12:52] this they will be getting more and more
[1:12:55] tired their body will be their muscles
[1:12:57] will be burning their body will be
[1:12:59] screaming at them it's time to
[1:13:02] stop their lungs will start burning they
[1:13:04] won't be able to get they'll feel like
[1:13:06] they can't get enough air in their sweat
[1:13:09] pouring
[1:13:11] out and there's just their body is going
[1:13:14] what are you doing to me why are we
[1:13:17] doing
[1:13:18] this and it's screaming at them to stop
[1:13:26] but there's this F
[1:13:28] phenomenon that's known of in Endurance
[1:13:32] Sports It's called The Second
[1:13:36] Wind and this is a phenomenon whereby an
[1:13:39] athlete who is out of breath and too
[1:13:41] tired to
[1:13:43] continue sometimes known as hitting the
[1:13:46] wall somehow finds the strength to press
[1:13:49] on at top performance with less
[1:13:53] exertion documented experiences of the
[1:13:55] second wind go back at least a 100 years
[1:13:58] when it was taken to be a commonly held
[1:13:59] fact of
[1:14:00] exercise the phenomenon has even come to
[1:14:03] be used as a metaphor for continuing on
[1:14:06] with Renewed Energy past the point
[1:14:07] thought to be one's Prime whether in
[1:14:11] Sports careers or life in
[1:14:14] general I'm sure we've all heard the
[1:14:17] term before the second wind and we've
[1:14:21] heard it used in
[1:14:22] conversation some of the guys that like
[1:14:24] to exercise maybe they've even
[1:14:26] experienced it pushing past that wall to
[1:14:28] be able to keep
[1:14:33] going and it's interesting when you
[1:14:34] start to look up about the second wind
[1:14:40] that doctors don't even know what it
[1:14:43] is there are theories as to what the
[1:14:47] second wind
[1:14:49] is but even an article I read by the
[1:14:53] Mayo Clinic
[1:14:55] gave three or four different
[1:14:57] possibilities of what it could be that
[1:15:00] allowed the second win to H happen but
[1:15:02] they didn't know for
[1:15:04] sure now they even one of the things
[1:15:07] they put in multiple medical things I
[1:15:09] didn't write them down I'm not even
[1:15:11] going to try to do something about the
[1:15:13] way your body Burns energy when it
[1:15:15] switches to a different energy source
[1:15:17] all this kind of stuff they have these
[1:15:19] thoughts on this is what's going on your
[1:15:22] body is making the switch from one
[1:15:24] source to another that's when you're
[1:15:26] hitting the wall and once the other
[1:15:28] energy source kicks in you get your
[1:15:30] second
[1:15:31] wind they have some other ideas and
[1:15:34] these different things and they even
[1:15:36] have one where it's all a mental thing
[1:15:39] you get the second win because you
[1:15:40] realize you're like over halfway towards
[1:15:43] the goal you were going for they'll find
[1:15:45] it a lot they said they find it a lot of
[1:15:47] times with Runners once they pass that
[1:15:49] halfway mark to where they go there is
[1:15:51] less in front of me than what's behind
[1:15:54] they can get get that second wind to
[1:15:55] keep
[1:15:57] going now whether
[1:16:00] it's purely mental whether it's physical
[1:16:03] in the way that God created our bodies I
[1:16:06] don't
[1:16:09] know there are even some doctors that
[1:16:11] say oh it's all Placebo it's not real
[1:16:14] people that's why it's it's all in the
[1:16:15] mind people think this is happening but
[1:16:16] it's actually not happening yeah um
[1:16:20] don't know I'm not a scientist I don't
[1:16:24] want to read enough health articles to
[1:16:25] figure this out this is not everything I
[1:16:28] found the doctors didn't know so I'm not
[1:16:30] going to try to figure it out myself but
[1:16:33] yeah we all know the term second win and
[1:16:35] we all know the mindset of pushing
[1:16:39] yourself to the point where you're so
[1:16:41] tired but yet somehow finding the energy
[1:16:44] to keep going on somehow finding the
[1:16:47] energy to make it
[1:16:51] past what you're trying to overcome
[1:16:57] Isaiah chter 40 and verse
[1:17:00] 30 even the youth shall faint and be
[1:17:02] weary and the young men shall utterly
[1:17:04] fall but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:17:06] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:17:09] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[1:17:10] run and not be weary they shall walk and
[1:17:13] not
[1:17:19] faint God promises us a second wind
[1:17:25] if we wait on the Lord if we are
[1:17:28] continuing
[1:17:32] to push forward in the way that we're
[1:17:35] supposed
[1:17:38] to if we're willing to keep going go all
[1:17:41] right Lord I don't know how I'm going to
[1:17:43] get through this I don't know how I'm
[1:17:46] going to even put my foot down to take
[1:17:48] the next
[1:17:49] step but I'm trusting
[1:17:52] you I don't know how we're going to get
[1:17:54] past this I don't know how we're going
[1:17:55] to get past this barrier I don't know
[1:17:57] how we're going to get past the wall I
[1:17:59] have hit the wall I don't know how it's
[1:18:01] coming
[1:18:02] down I don't know what we're
[1:18:05] doing but Lord I'm going to keep
[1:18:08] pressing I'm going to keep going
[1:18:14] forward it says even you shall faint and
[1:18:19] be
[1:18:22] weary even the athletes even the the
[1:18:25] ones who have all the energy that can
[1:18:27] run around all over the place even
[1:18:28] they're going to get tired they're going
[1:18:30] to get
[1:18:33] weary the young men shall utterly fall
[1:18:36] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:18:39] renew their
[1:18:41] strength you're going to keep pressing
[1:18:43] you're going to
[1:18:45] keep pushing forward because we're
[1:18:47] keeping our eye on the Finish Line
[1:18:50] that's up ahead we're not trying to
[1:18:52] finish the short race that the world's
[1:18:53] going for we're trying
[1:18:55] we're here for the long
[1:18:57] game we have the long goal out in front
[1:18:59] of us and that's what we're going to
[1:19:00] keep going for whether that's means
[1:19:02] we're slogging through some mud whether
[1:19:04] that means we're going across the Sandy
[1:19:06] terrain that you hate running
[1:19:08] on we're going to keep pressing forward
[1:19:10] because the Lord has given us a Finish
[1:19:12] Line that's way out in the
[1:19:14] distance or at least it was way out in
[1:19:16] the distance when we
[1:19:18] started we know that that Finish Line
[1:19:21] keeps getting closer and closer bless
[1:19:23] the Lord hallelujah
[1:19:25] and the Lord has said I'm going to renew
[1:19:27] your
[1:19:28] strength you'll go through those Seasons
[1:19:31] where you are tired you're going to go
[1:19:34] through the time where you're facing
[1:19:37] these trials you're facing the troubles
[1:19:39] and you're not sure how you're going to
[1:19:41] make
[1:19:43] it whether that's because of your
[1:19:46] own physical health issues whether
[1:19:49] that's because of trials that are going
[1:19:51] on around you whether that's because of
[1:19:54] some kind of loss that's been
[1:19:55] experienced yeah we're going through
[1:19:57] this tough time and the Lord has said if
[1:20:01] you'll wait on
[1:20:03] me another way of saying if you'll trust
[1:20:06] in
[1:20:07] me yes then I will renew your
[1:20:12] strength I will restore you I will lift
[1:20:16] you back up I will keep you
[1:20:20] going maybe you stumbled
[1:20:25] maybe you
[1:20:28] fell but it's not a Sprint you fall on a
[1:20:33] Sprint it's over you've lost it's done
[1:20:36] by the time you stand back up they've
[1:20:38] already finished it's
[1:20:41] over but this is a distance race we're
[1:20:45] going for a
[1:20:47] while and you're going to hit that point
[1:20:50] hey I'm hitting the wall my muscles are
[1:20:51] getting tired and I stumbled
[1:20:55] I
[1:20:56] tripped I lost my gate for a
[1:21:00] minute but that doesn't mean I stop
[1:21:03] running it doesn't mean that I sit to
[1:21:05] the side and go throw up my hands I'm
[1:21:07] done I
[1:21:11] tripped okay you
[1:21:14] tripped if you're trying to finish the
[1:21:17] marathon if you're trying to finish the
[1:21:19] distance
[1:21:21] running you can still keep going
[1:21:25] there's room to
[1:21:31] recover and there's a Lord that promised
[1:21:34] to renew your strength prise the Lord
[1:21:38] praise the Lord Brother brandom said in
[1:21:40] the sermon as the eagle stirreth up her
[1:21:42] nest the eagle is supposed to be a bird
[1:21:44] that renews his youth every so often no
[1:21:46] matter how old he is turns back to a
[1:21:49] young bird again not in years but in
[1:21:51] physical makeup he renews his youth the
[1:21:54] Bible say said he did thou will renew
[1:21:56] his youth like the eagle what a
[1:21:58] beautiful type it is of the church when
[1:21:59] we're weary worn torn about to go in and
[1:22:02] renew our strength and mount up like the
[1:22:04] eagle above all of our cares and
[1:22:07] Fashions and things of this
[1:22:12] world acts 4 and:
[1:22:15] 31 and when they had prayed the place
[1:22:18] was shaken where they were assembled
[1:22:19] together and they were all filled with
[1:22:20] the Holy Ghost and they spake the word
[1:22:22] of God with boldness
[1:22:26] Acts 2 they had already been
[1:22:28] filled Acts 2 they received the Holy
[1:22:31] Ghost and they went out speaking in
[1:22:35] tongues acts
[1:22:39] 4 the place was shaken where they were
[1:22:41] assembled together and they were all
[1:22:43] filled with the Holy Ghost this was not
[1:22:46] a new group this was not a different set
[1:22:51] of
[1:22:52] people these were the same individuals
[1:22:55] that had been in the upper room two
[1:22:57] chapters
[1:22:58] before yeah yeah and they came down and
[1:23:02] they had already been through some
[1:23:04] trials Peter had just come out of being
[1:23:06] in front of the San hedrin and being
[1:23:09] lectured and told never to speak again
[1:23:11] all these kinds of
[1:23:15] things and so the Lord was like all
[1:23:17] right it's time for a fresh anointing
[1:23:21] it's time to renew some strength to keep
[1:23:22] them going
[1:23:25] they weren't in the depths of Despair or
[1:23:27] anything they were just
[1:23:30] praying if you read through the chapter
[1:23:32] Peter wasn't even wasn't upset that he
[1:23:34] had been hauled in he was he was
[1:23:35] celebrating he was good with
[1:23:37] this and the Lord still was like great
[1:23:40] we'll give you a refilling let's keep
[1:23:42] this going let's make sure that you have
[1:23:44] strength for the next step let's make
[1:23:46] sure you have strength for what's coming
[1:23:51] now and when we live in a world that's
[1:23:53] so focused on
[1:23:55] let me gather as much stuff as I
[1:23:59] can and then the results are that there
[1:24:02] are more people tired than
[1:24:06] ever you can't tell me these aren't
[1:24:10] related that people have more
[1:24:13] stuff more things to think about more
[1:24:16] things to be worried about and they're
[1:24:19] now more
[1:24:21] tired and Paul tells us lay aside
[1:24:25] the weight and the sin that do so easily
[1:24:29] beset
[1:24:31] us you've got a ways to go we've got a
[1:24:37] distance only take what's necessary
[1:24:40] praise the Lord only take what's
[1:24:45] important you know if
[1:24:48] you're being in Florida I've been in
[1:24:50] some areas where they had to have an
[1:24:53] evacuation Zone because of hurricane was
[1:24:56] coming when you're evacuating you're
[1:24:59] only supposed to be taking what's
[1:25:03] necessary you're supposed to take what
[1:25:06] is most
[1:25:08] important and if you lose the rest it's
[1:25:11] okay but it's when you're in an
[1:25:14] evacuation situation it's just
[1:25:17] take the important things if you if
[1:25:20] there are any documents that you have to
[1:25:22] have make sure you've got those maybe
[1:25:24] grab picture albums that you don't want
[1:25:26] to lose that kind of thing but don't oh
[1:25:29] man I've got to make sure that I took my
[1:25:30] newest computer that I just bought or
[1:25:32] I've got this or I've got that no don't
[1:25:34] weigh yourself down with a whole bunch
[1:25:36] of this stuff just take make sure you've
[1:25:40] got some clothes make sure you've got
[1:25:43] some food and
[1:25:45] resources but you just take what's
[1:25:50] important when you're running a
[1:25:52] race you don't want to be hauling
[1:25:55] everything in the world with
[1:25:57] you when you look at how any of these
[1:26:00] guys dress when they're going to a race
[1:26:01] none of them are carrying
[1:26:04] backpacks not a
[1:26:07] one if there's someone carrying a
[1:26:10] backpack he probably shouldn't be in the
[1:26:13] race pretty simple they are not carrying
[1:26:18] anything
[1:26:20] extra yeah they
[1:26:23] just have have the clothes they're
[1:26:27] wearing normally with these kind of
[1:26:29] Races they don't even have to worry
[1:26:30] about carrying water cuz there's water
[1:26:32] spots set all along the race so I don't
[1:26:34] even have to carry a bottle with me I
[1:26:36] just run and I grab water as I go past
[1:26:38] drink and throw the cup on the
[1:26:42] ground that's it I don't need to carry
[1:26:45] snacks I don't need to carry this or
[1:26:48] that I'm just here to
[1:26:52] run and God put us in this
[1:26:55] life and you have to take only what's
[1:27:00] necessary okay yes God has called us to
[1:27:02] live here we have a life that is erased
[1:27:06] so we have to have a way to provide we
[1:27:09] have to be able to have food we have to
[1:27:11] be able to have certain things there are
[1:27:13] certain things that are Necessities I'm
[1:27:15] not saying sell everything you have and
[1:27:17] go live up on a hill we're not doing
[1:27:20] that but at the same time we're not in
[1:27:23] the mindset of I'm trying to accumulate
[1:27:25] as much as I can that's the world's
[1:27:28] mindset that's what their goal is their
[1:27:32] goal is to get out and be able to show I
[1:27:34] am so important because I have so much
[1:27:36] stuff and I have the fanciest car I have
[1:27:40] the best uh Nintendo system or
[1:27:46] whatever that's the world
[1:27:48] mindset we're not out to
[1:27:52] show that we're something special
[1:27:54] because we own this or we have
[1:27:57] that we are living a life that's
[1:28:00] different we're not supposed to be we're
[1:28:01] not caught up in the same things as the
[1:28:04] world we live with a different purpose
[1:28:07] we live with a different mindset we live
[1:28:10] with a different Target a different
[1:28:12] Finish
[1:28:14] Line the world is living with one target
[1:28:18] they're
[1:28:19] sprinting they're out to get there as
[1:28:22] fast as they can with as much as they
[1:28:27] can God is calling us to run a different
[1:28:30] kind of race God is calling us to live a
[1:28:34] different kind of way
[1:28:37] yes and everyone we rub shoulders
[1:28:41] with is living with a different mindset
[1:28:44] with living with a different race than
[1:28:47] we are all
[1:28:49] right it's the best way that I can
[1:28:51] explain it they're running A different
[1:28:53] race they're playing a different game
[1:28:55] they're
[1:28:55] doing a completely different
[1:28:59] task it looks like we're all living the
[1:29:01] same life because we're all here in this
[1:29:04] world they're wearing clothes like we
[1:29:06] are they're going to a job like we are
[1:29:07] they're doing this they're doing that
[1:29:10] but they have a completely different
[1:29:12] purpose they have a completely different
[1:29:14] goal they have a completely different
[1:29:18] Target and we're going to go through
[1:29:20] things in life that gets us tired we're
[1:29:22] going to go through things in life
[1:29:24] in a world that is built around
[1:29:27] weariness anymore it seems like where
[1:29:29] everyone is tired everyone is struggling
[1:29:32] everyone is stressed or upset about
[1:29:35] different
[1:29:36] things we're going to go through seasons
[1:29:39] and we're going to go thingss either
[1:29:41] because of our own choices because we
[1:29:44] chose to go the sinful route and now we
[1:29:47] have to suffer the
[1:29:49] consequences or because of the trials
[1:29:51] and tests that are coming at us we're
[1:29:53] going to go through times when we get
[1:29:56] tired and we get
[1:29:59] weary but the difference
[1:30:02] is God has promised to renew our
[1:30:06] strength if we will call on him if we
[1:30:09] will trust on him if we will wait on him
[1:30:11] he will renew our strength to keep
[1:30:14] fighting to keep pushing to make it
[1:30:17] through the times when everyone around
[1:30:20] us thought oh they're going down they're
[1:30:22] never getting up from that again this is
[1:30:24] it this is what finishes
[1:30:27] them cuz you've seen those kinds of
[1:30:30] things in those distance races where
[1:30:32] someone will
[1:30:35] fall and if you ever listen to any
[1:30:37] commentators about it they'll be like oh
[1:30:40] are they going to be able to get up are
[1:30:41] they done is this the
[1:30:45] end right and if we were talking about
[1:30:48] the Sprint yes it is the end they may
[1:30:51] get up and finish but there's
[1:30:54] they're nowhere close to any type of
[1:30:57] wind but when you're talking about the
[1:31:02] distance they get back up and they keep
[1:31:06] going and they keep
[1:31:09] running and when they hit the wall they
[1:31:11] keep running and they keep pushing
[1:31:15] themselves because the goal is the
[1:31:19] Finish Paul
[1:31:21] wrote We Run
[1:31:25] to finish you have the Finish Line
[1:31:29] ahead right as musicians
[1:31:33] come I already read this in Hebrews 12
[1:31:37] but it says wherefore seeing we are also
[1:31:40] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:31:42] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:31:44] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[1:31:46] us and let us one run with patience the
[1:31:48] race that is set before us in another
[1:31:52] translation it reads very similarly
[1:31:56] except it says and let us run with
[1:32:00] endurance the race that is set before
[1:32:06] us God has called us to keep running God
[1:32:10] has called
[1:32:11] us to keep running because the finish
[1:32:14] line is there and he's promised to renew
[1:32:16] our strength he's promised that he's
[1:32:19] going to help you overcome he's going to
[1:32:21] help you get through each one of those
[1:32:23] struggles each one of those
[1:32:25] trials we're not doing this because
[1:32:27] we're such amazing athletes we can do it
[1:32:29] on our
[1:32:30] own but we're doing it because we have a
[1:32:33] God that will renew us we have a God
[1:32:36] that will strengthen us we have a God
[1:32:38] that will pick us up when we fall down
[1:32:41] and will get us back on the
[1:32:44] path and it's not just running with
[1:32:47] patience but God calls us to run with
[1:32:50] endurance he calls us to keep enduring
[1:32:54] to keep pushing through each thing that
[1:32:56] comes
[1:33:00] along the endurance is what sets the
[1:33:04] distance Runners apart from the
[1:33:06] sprinters the sprinters are great at
[1:33:09] quick they're great at races that take
[1:33:12] seconds or
[1:33:15] minutes but they're not going to last
[1:33:17] for hours they're not going to last to
[1:33:19] keep going and keep
[1:33:22] going but the racers
[1:33:25] that are willing to live differently
[1:33:28] they're willing to eat differently
[1:33:30] they're willing to train differently
[1:33:32] they're willing
[1:33:34] to slim down and lay aside some of that
[1:33:39] weight and then with the endurance
[1:33:42] they'll keep running the race and
[1:33:44] they'll keep
[1:33:47] going they'll be able to go past the
[1:33:50] struggles they'll be able to to go past
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:57] you know it's common in in distance
[1:34:00] racing particularly as people are
[1:34:02] beginning to learn
[1:34:05] it that it is super common for when
[1:34:09] people finish that they are vomiting as
[1:34:12] they get past the Finish Line because
[1:34:14] they have pushed their body to such a
[1:34:18] point that it doesn't know how to handle
[1:34:21] anything it doesn't know how to handle
[1:34:23] any water they've taken it it doesn't
[1:34:24] know how to handle it's just get rid of
[1:34:26] it all CU it doesn't know what to do
[1:34:29] because they have pushed
[1:34:33] themsel farther
[1:34:35] than most of us will even think about
[1:34:41] going and God is calling us to a race to
[1:34:44] go
[1:34:46] further and to run it differently than
[1:34:49] anyone we see around us
[1:34:53] God's calling us to be willing to live
[1:34:57] differently to be willing to train
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:01] differently we're not having to go out
[1:35:04] and find who's the the latest
[1:35:08] great Theologian that can open up the
[1:35:11] scriptures to us and the greatest
[1:35:14] psychologist to help us with our
[1:35:16] families or help us with this struggle
[1:35:18] or that
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:21] struggle God gave us his word and he
[1:35:24] gave us a prophet to open up the word to
[1:35:27] us and he says here this is your
[1:35:31] diet you don't need all the
[1:35:34] rest you need
[1:35:37] this and this is going to help you slim
[1:35:39] down it's going to help you to shed some
[1:35:42] of that extra weight that's been trying
[1:35:44] to hang
[1:35:46] on some of those habits that you used to
[1:35:49] have some of those things that used to
[1:35:51] try to to weigh you down
[1:35:56] and I'm going to be
[1:35:59] here and when you hit the
[1:36:02] wall when you hit that point where you
[1:36:04] go I don't have the strength to go any
[1:36:06] further I can't do
[1:36:11] anymore I've run
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:16] out that's when God looks down and
[1:36:19] goes I can give you a refilling
[1:36:23] right I can renew your strength I can
[1:36:26] lift you back up I can give you what you
[1:36:29] need in this
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:35] moment whether
[1:36:37] the second wind
[1:36:40] is something physical something mental
[1:36:43] in the
[1:36:44] natural it really doesn't
[1:36:49] matter God
[1:36:51] promised in his way of saying it I will
[1:36:55] renew your
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:36:59] strength we can call it the second wind
[1:37:01] so that we have some type of fancy title
[1:37:03] to put on the
[1:37:05] sermon but really it comes down to God
[1:37:11] said wait on the
[1:37:13] Lord and I will renew your
[1:37:18] strength I will come in and I will help
[1:37:20] you get through it I will help you
[1:37:23] overcome I will help you break that
[1:37:25] barrier I will break those chains I will
[1:37:29] tear down the wall I will do the things
[1:37:31] that are
