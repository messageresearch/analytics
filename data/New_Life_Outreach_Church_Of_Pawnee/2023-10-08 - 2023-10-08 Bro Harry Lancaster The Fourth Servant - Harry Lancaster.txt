[Music] lord it's good to be back back in the house of the Lord again praise the Lord just one second while I'm getting this computer set up where it's supposed to [Music] be all right let's go ahead and turn to James chapter 4 James chapter 4 we'll read verses seven and 8 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleans your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded now let's turn back to Malachi chapter 3 Malachi chapter 3 and we're going to read verse 10 bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and one more scripture before we pray let's turn to Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6 and we'll start at verse 19 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also let's go ahead and go before the Lord Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord we've we've worshiped you Lord we've praised your name the the congregation and musicians and everyone has done their best to to set an atmosphere for you to be able to move Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you would just help me to step out of the way Lord that you would take control of of my lips Lord take control of my words Lord Jesus and Lord may you just speak to the hearts of the people Lord Lord you know what I've been thinking about and the direction you seem to have steered me Lord and Lord I pray that it would just be a blessing Lord we just commit the remainer the service into your hands name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may all have your seats I will so this before I uh left for the afternoon I was talking with uh brother William and um I was talking about that I had two different thoughts that I was uh thinking about and um neither one of them were finished thoughts um and I wasn't sure which direction we were going to be going and so uh went home with my family and spent a little bit of time looking in at one thought and I was putting some more quotes and verses and things with it but it was never quite coming together and um I spent the most of my time at home trying to work on that and it just wasn't connecting like it was supposed to and about five minutes or so before we were supposed to leave to head back I started looking at the other thing and um things started stacking up and I just kept thinking about it on the way here and so any ended up going that thought Direction and so we'll see how the Lord works with it and it's going to seem very confusing as we start because after having read those verses uh the title for tonight's sermon is going to be the fourth servant and every one of you is sitting there going how in the world do any of these things tie together and Lord willing we'll find out um and we'll see see how it goes so um brother random talks in the sermon the Queen of Sheba and he says but that little Queen wanted it but the first thing she wanted to know was it scriptural or not she studied all the scriptures then she said I'm going to do another thing I'm I'm a queen and if that message is right I'm going to support it and she ladened camels with gold and M frankincense and all kind of costly apparel and such she said if it's right if that God is re a real God then I'm through with this thing I've been serving and and I'm going to support it with everything I've got that's the attitude listen God's not concerned so much about your money but he wants you to support him with all that you are he doesn't want 10% of your money so much as he wants your time your talent your testimony and all that you are to be given into his hand so he can control you he wants to be your lord not only your savior but your lord lordship to govern and she said I'll support it if it's right if it's not I can bring my money back home that's a good sensible thing for a lot of Americans to listen to and he talks about it as well in the sermon a greater than Solomon is here brother brandom speaking said she said if that's not right I'll bring my money back if it is right I owe something to it that's the way we should feel if this be God not only our money our money is little but we owe him our hearts our time our talents and everything that we have we owe it to God if it's right let's go into it with everything we got if it isn't right go find what is right and then get into it that's right so we're going to start out a little bit different this evening um and I am going to of the the four boys that are sitting here on the the front I need three volunteers okay Aaron it's one Simmy it's two Paul all right we've got three all right boys come on up and then I'm going to draft brother Robert to come up here and so that's right be J walk up here come up to the front come on so we're going to have these boys acting out a little bit of something for us and they have no clue what they're doing there they have no script and so everything is well but as soon as I begin to tell the story they're all going to know exactly what their parts are and what they're supposed to do so there once was a rich landowner and this Rich landowner was going to go onto a trip he was going to go away and so he called his three most trusted servants and he was going to give them money to take care of his business and to run his business while he was gone and so he went to each one of his servants you get to pick them out so the first servant that came up he went and he gave him five talents for him to use to gather his to to to used while he was gone to the second one he gave two talents and then to the third he gave one Talent now after he had given his talents he went on his journey you can go just sit on the platform for a minute he went on his journey and he left his three servants to do the work and now the first servant that had the five talents which one of you is that Simmy all right so Simmy you were thinking about how you could increase that and you decided you know I bet you if I go spend some time with Brother Steve we're going to be able to do some business together and we'll be able to have an increase so go ahe and go go over to Brother Steve then who had the two talents all right so Paul had the two talents and he was thinking about it and you know he really for some reason his mind kept going to to music and worship and so he decided deed that he was going to go spend some time with brother Colby and he was going to find a way to get increase there and so he went to to see brother Colby and Aaron Aaron had been given the the one talent and Aaron wasn't quite sure exactly what to do he wasn't exactly quite exactly sure about how to handle it but he decided to go home and just kind of tuck it under his pillow for the moment you can just go back to your seat on the front row for a moment and so he went and he just kind of stuck it under his pillow stuck it under his bed wherever while he tried to figure out what he was going to do how he could do anything to actually receive an increase and time passed and as it went the rich landowner brother Robert returned from his trip and when he got back he immediately called his his three Faithful Servants to return to them so that way he could find out how they had done all you guys come on up come on back and the the Lord called up and the first servant brother Simi comes forward and go on over and he presented back all that he had gained and through his time with another brother through his time he had been able to invest those wisely and so he had grown his five talents into 10 talents and then we had brother Paul that went up and he had spent time with brother Colby and they had been able to invest in different things and he had grown his his two talents into four talents he had doubled what he had and then we had Aaron come up and Aaron had had his coin hidden he hadn't never been quite sure what to do or how to invest it and unfortunately Aaron drew the Short Straw of this story and he was the servant that ended up being cast out because he had been faithless he hadn't actually used the talent that God had given him and so brother Robert gave that extra talent to Simi because he had been proven so trustworthy he got in excess he went even Beyond to go here's another talent because I know you already did well with these you can keep working with more I'll take all those back right now thank you brother Robert and thanks to these three gentlemen they are going to get I didn't have dollar with me but they're each going to still get payment for services rendered s you can go back thank you appreciate you guys yes you get some too all right and so we all know this this Parable that that that that Jesus put forth we've all heard it multiple times we've all gone through this about what we're supposed to do with our talents and God has given each one of us talents and and skills and abilities and some are even get blessed to have gifts and callings that are placed on their lives to go this is what you're supposed to do but even if it's not one of the uh what you would call the the the spiritual gifts or things each one has been given talents and skills that are just for them to go this is what you're able to do this is what you are created to do different than anyone else you're given away where you look at the world a little bit different than anyone now maybe maybe the way you look at the world is very similar to certain other brothers or sisters around you but you still look at it through a little bit different lens through a little bit different way because that's how you're created that's what God made you to be and so God has given you these talents that are to be invested that are to be used wisely for his kingdom and we can go through it and I know the the boys probably felt silly as they were up here going through the the motions and Aaron I'm sorry that you got the Short Straw we know that you're not one that'll hide under the bed um and so they each had their talents and they each you know they each had a talent that they were willing to help act out the story for us that they were willing to to step into this I have I have a a daughter that loves to draw she loves to be artistic now I don't know exactly how that is going to develop as she continues to grow I don't know where it's going to go but it's a talent that is in her whether that'll become a talent that becomes really impressive or whether it just stays something where she likes to Doodle or she likes to draw in the borders of her book or likes to do these different things that's between her and God to figure out but she has a talent she has a desire to do certain things brother Colby has a talent when it comes to being a musician he has a talent when it comes to worship he has a talent in what he's able to offer in these things and he then is going to be responsible for that talent and each one of it has these talents that are in our lives even when we feel like well I don't have any talents I'm not a singer I'm not a worship leader I'm not a musician I'm not a minister I'm not a run right down and you go I have no talents I don't know what to do I'm not the person that is ever going to be up in front and being lauded for everything that I'm able to do or my ability you know I saw sister Carol raise her hand as I started talking about that and I'll be the first one I think most of us have talked about this before that sister Carol has the talent to just get in and work especially in today's society that is a talent to have somebody that will just get in and get done and just try to do things and try to serve those around her that is a talent that is a talent that she has developed over time and grown and worked with I work with lots of teenagers I've seen plenty that don't have that Talent it's a talent that she has worked with and each one of us has a talent there are certain people in here I'm sure that are true prayer warriors that can go in and they can spend hours in prayer before the Lord I don't have that talent I can pray but I am not a person that easily slips into that kind of thing I am not a person that easily presses into that type that is not the gift that was placed in me that is not the gift or the talent that was given to me but there are those that have that kind of talent there are those that that have a talent to reach out to their brothers and sisters around them and maybe they're like hey I'm good at sending a text to people I'm good at just sending a quick message to be like hey I missed you at church hey I haven't T I'm sorry I was busy I didn't get a chance to talk to you on Sunday but I just want you to know that I'm thinking about you that I'm praying for you there are different ones that have things that you might not even classify as a talent but to God he's given them this ability he's given them this talent that this is what you're supposed to do this is what I'm call calling you to do with it brother brandom said in the sermon Watchman what of the night he says yours ago there was a writer Fanny Crosby she was blind she didn't sell her Birthright like many fine singers today in the television of movie World sold out their Birthright for just a few Boogie wogie songs or rock and roll but miss Crosby was a different woman they come to her one day and said why don't you write modern poetry why don't you write songs for the entertainment world she said I give all my talents to God so well you believe there'll be a heaven then saides said you think you'll be there she yes said now what when you get there if you remain blind how will you know him she said I'll feel the nail scar in his hands she turned went walking back walking back in the room and when she did she raised her hands and began to praise God when they walked Outdoors the song strucked her she said I shall know him I shall know him and Redeemed by his side I shall stand I shall know him I shall know him by the the prince of the nails in his hands and today brother and sister she's walking on the streets of Glory with a far better sight than anybody on this Earth ever had she sees him knows him and standing Redeemed by his side oh if ID asked her tonight Fanny Crosby what does Christ mean to you she'd sing this song for me she something like this see one of her famous old songs I was thinking of a while ago she said nothing in this world I have all is in him what was that song now I was thinking a few minutes ago that she sing that was such a beautiful song however I remember singing I'll think of it in a few minutes that she said he means more than this world to me whom have I on Earth beside thee whom in heaven but thee pass me not oh gentle Savi hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by what would it mean to you and I who can work and labor and serve the Lord Jesus in the way that we do God bless you I remember my mom talking we used to when I was younger we would get these uh books that would be um the biographies of famous Christians and my mom and and I read the one about Fanny crossby and I remember talking with my mom about it and she was like it was super in interesting for the first half and the last half was ju just kept saying basically over and over and Fanny Crosby got with this publishing company and she wrote this song and this song and this song and this song and this song and this song and this song and this song and then she left that publishing company and she went to this publishing company and she wrote this song and this song and this she wrote a lot of songs but there wasn't anything like amazing and dramatic at the end of her life that would be exciting to read about because she had surrendered her all to Christ it was just I'm going to keep writing songs I'm going to keep surrendering my gift and so if you looked at it from the worldly standards it wasn't an exciting end to her life it was just she wrote song after song after song after song they kept going and she kept writing because she kept surrendering her Talent she kept giving her gift to the Lord and the Lord kept using it and it didn't bring her in millions of dollars it didn't make her wealthy it didn't do any of those things but she had this talent that she didn't stop even at the end towards the end of her life she continued writing she continued writing and when a publishing company didn't want to use her anymore she would go to somebody else because she had more to write she was still being inspired she had more that was going she wasn't going to these different publishing companies because I can get a better contract there I can make more money there she was just going someplace that would let her publish what she had that would let her publish what was coming from her heart because that was the talent that God had put there that was what God had inspired her to do that's what God had called her to do and no it didn't make for an exciting biography but it's going to be considered valuable on the other side it's going to be held up as this is somebody who used her gift correctly this is somebody who used her Talent correctly and maybe she didn't receive a ton of accolades on this side but on that side she has on that side she did because she surrendered it all brother brandham was talking the sermon earnestly contending for the faith and he said now hearing this our brother on those birds like that that is a spiritual gift try to impersonate it once see how you get along God has given that to the brother I heard this young man singing that song yielded Lord to thee and how that brother Cobble sitting there told me he just converted out of a nightclub he and his wife and how that's singing try to impersonate that it's a gift it comes from God now the gift was in him when he was born the gift was in the other man when he was born but what they use it for what goes every man will have to answer for his talent God gives men talent and they have to use it some can preach like a house on fire and the other different things but God requires these talents and I'm so thankful to know that these two Brethren sitting back here have yielded their talents which they could be out here in a nightclub and everything else using those talents but they surrendered them to the Lord Jesus Christ to win souls and I'm happy for this this morning and my brethren may the Lord ever continue the little brother here the song leader brother cell many others here God has given you Talent maybe you say well brother brandom he hasn't given me nothing you don't know maybe see you just go to try something maybe you've never went and testified to somebody try that everybody can't do that maybe you can't something else that you could do there's something you can do that you can put it to God but now the thing you have to do do what the brother singing his song yield the man who could whistle and impersonate little birds that I ever heard well then that man yielded himself to it give into it the man who could sing he yielded himself he give into it now for these things here of the gospel and the manifestation of Visions I just yield myself and give into it and that's what does it see it's not me it's him and it's something that you can't help the man can't help because he was born to whistle like birds why he's just bornn that way the man that sang was the same way and to see Visions is just common to me as it is to them to do that you see what I mean it's all together it's for one edification of the glory of Jesus Christ the son of God each one of us has talents and often these talents are not what we would consider to be talents when you if you tried to ask the world okay what talent does this person have or what talent does that person have a a lot of people they'd look at and go oh they don't have talents they can't they can't do anything really worthwhile it's like they're just a whatever they just have this they just have that but yet God has created each one of us especially to have a talent each one of us to have what I truly believe is every one of us has multiple talents we're not just gifted in one single area we all have multiple things that God has created us to be able to do now I may not be able to sing so well that I can go out and get a record deal and I can be somebody that can do this or do that but God has still called me to use the voice that he did give me I may not be able to as I've started learning to play a guitar I may not be able to play a guitar close to anything anyone else in the congregation can do I may not be able to play a guitar that would ever get get me on any type of record or anything like that but God's called me to use what he's given me however small or large it may be whether it's I was given the one Talent or whether it's I was given the five talents we're called to use it we're called to use however God has brought it to us whatever is within us however strong or powerful it may be when I was talking about my daughter enjoying to draw and be artistic she may never be able to make a drawing that would sell and make money she may not have that level of talent but she's called to use the talent that she has if the best she can do is make a nice picture that she gives to a friend on a bad day that makes that person feel a little bit better then that's what she's responsible to do God calls us to use the talents at the level that we're given if one of the sisters is good at baking and you enjoy it and something that you go into you're not good enough that you want to sell it or anything like that but you like to give it to someone else in the church occasionally you like to provide a little encouragement do this do that it's a talent that you're using and so each one of us has I truly believe multiple talents God didn't create you with you're a one andone this is the only thing you were created for this is the only reason you have to live is this one thing God doesn't make us that singular God has made us with so many facets and so many differences within our lives and God is calling us to use each one of those to the best of our ability to use those talents to be like the man with the five talents and I'm not even sure that five is a good number most of us probably go above five if you start to cover everything you you know everyone that's a parent God has given you a talent to raise your children on to raise your children specifically and for every mom here God has equipped you to raise your children even if you feel like you don't know what you're doing even when you feel like you have no clue how to handle the situation for every dad God has equipped us to raise our children now I'm not equipped to raise brother col's kids those are not my kids I am not equipped to raise them I'm called to raise my kids yes sir even when I don't know what I'm doing and I have no clue God is there to equip us and has given us that skill that talent to raise our children God has given us what we need for the situations that are coming through and we're then responsible to use that talent and that ability true you know when brother Wendell talks about getting his sons to be business owners and brother Colby running the electric business and these different things like he has been given skills and abilities and talents to go into that now he may never be called to be a multi-millionaire business owner God may not have equipped him to hit that level but God has given him a talent up to a certain point and he is responsible to use his talents up to that level for the told me I'm sorry I'm picking on you tonight but he is he's called to use what he's been given and what he's equipped with I've worked at Chick-fil-A for years I've been in the the business at different restaurants for years and I have certain talents and certain abilities that have come out over time which I then use within the restaurant and the role that I'm in I'm not responsible to go out and own my own restaurant at this time that's not what God has impressed on me to do that's what not God has pushed me so at the moment I don't know that he's equipped me to be in that place which is fine if that's not what I'm called to do I'm called to work where I'm at with the talents and abilities that he's given me we can look at the same thing when we're looking at you know the ministers I'm not called to preach in the same way that brother William does I'm not called to preach in the same way that brother Wendell does I don't have have that type of ability that type of talent it's not put in me I'm called to be who I am I'm called to minister the way that I do I'm called to speak the way that I do and it's different and that's okay I may not be called to travel all over the place and you know be like brother Josh being gone from home for a month traveling because he's ministering everywhere or like my father-in-law Brother David that travels every other every weekend or every other weekend and is all over the place and that's fine I don't want that calling I like being home they're welcome to travel but God has placed different callings and different talents on each one brother brandom said in the sermon conferences and he said that's why we have so much tomat today on the radio and television of men like men who has got talents singers like Ernie Ford and Elvis Presley those boys who is selling out their birth rights for a mess of pottage they get out there and all you have to do is be a jok stir or turn some crack or something like that to make the American public laugh when you know you're only trying to quieten them and you know behind it all we know that judgment is at hand that's right might as well face it we're at the end of the road Brethren and all the Ernie Ford jokes and the Elvis Presley rock and rolls and all this stuff it's another Nebuchadnezzar's Feast it won't do a bit of good judgment is going to strike brother random says in the sermon three kinds of believers he says' but they sell out like Judas that's the make believer some of them are highly talented people and this make believer watch that guy that's the shrewd guy this little guy that fills up quick and jumps up and runs out every little phrase that he don't like you don't pay no attention to him he's just an unbeliever to begin with but when you see this guy a make believer hangs on see that's the Judas that's him like great talents I'm going to call names here which I really shouldn't do it but I'm going to call them anyhow so that you'll know like Elvis Presley Red Foley Ernie Ford Pat boom Elvis Presley a Pentecostal Pat Boon a Church of Christ Red Foley a deacon in the Church of Christ and I think erus Ford is Methodist and all those people with those talents smart out on television people saying well aren't they religious they sing songs that don't mean one thing yes sir deceiving the world what do they get out of it Judas got 30 pieces of silver Elvis a fleet of Cadillacs and 100 or two 100 50 million or a million dollar on records and things like that Pat Boon and the rest of them I don't care what church they belong to and everything it's hypocrisy it's a makeb believe it's a front that their life proves it that isn't right then there are those with the talents that is a great organizer worldly Vision they preach the gospel claim to Smart men intellectuals listen a man that's trained in that field he is not a preacher he's a lecturer that's what the trouble today we have lectures Jesus never said go and train to do this he said go preach the gospel and these signs shall follow the preaching see that's not to learn to make a lecturer who can stand and just mind put them flowery things in make you feel like you're sitting right in the presence of an archangel that isn't it having forms of godliness you see that's a lecturer not the Holy Spirit In Action some little fellow that wouldn't know as ABCs might come down with the power of Faith with the word and make the Holy Spirit do things that that man knows nothing about and deny it see there you are great people yes sir then they are organizers they are prosperous successful Smart in worldly wisdom that's right let's turn to Revelations chap 3 Revelations chapter 3 very s familiar scripture we'll start at verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leodan write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy Work thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white rment thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will suck with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I Grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches there's a story that I remember hearing over the years it's not anything that brother brandham told this is just a a story that different ministers have said over time or different ones have have spoken about but there was an incredibly large group of people assembled on one side of the group stood a man Jesus on the other side of the group stood another Satan separating them running through the group was off fence both Jesus and Satan began calling the people in the group and one by one each having made up his or her mind each went to either Jesus or Satan this kept going on and eventually Jesus had gathered around him a group of people from the larger crowds as had Satan but one man joined neither group he climbed the fence that was there and just sat on it then Jesus and his people left and disappeared and so too did Satan and his people and the man was left sitting there on the fence all alone and then Satan came back walking back into the scene looking around like he had lost something the man on the fence said are you looking for something or did you lose something and Satan looked at and was like nope you're right there come on the man on the fence said I didn't choose either side I stayed right here and Satan looked at was like yeah but I own the fence come with me so when we look at this to me it fits with the idea of the lukewarm that's talked about in Revelations of thinking that you can be in the middle of the line thinking that you can go neither side I don't have to be cold or hot I'm not fully sold out to Satan I'm not fully sold out to God so I'm safe right in the middle on the fence not realizing that the lukewarm is what God spews out to him it's worse than the cold it's worse than the hot but yet that's where so many people think they're safe kylin I'm going to borrow you for a moment so I titled this sermon the fourth servant come on up kylin titled this the fourth servant because in the story that we all know so well Jesus talks about three servants you have the two servants that go and use all of their talents and you have the one servant that doesn't use his talent and I'm not trying to add to scripture so pardon me hopefully you can all excuse where we go with this but imagine for a moment if we had a fourth servant that was called the kylin you are our fourth servant and he was called in and the master went and gave him his talents and he was given four talents and so kylin was thinking about okay what do I do to develop these talents what what can I do to bring in an increase but I don't want to lose everything and so what if I save two behind or one behind and I only use some and so he decided that he was going to go spend some time with brother Joe Green so go ahead and go over and hang out with brother Joe and so he went but he wasn't G to give quite everything and so he spent some time with with brother Joe and he worked with the ideas that the two came up with and then the the land owner came back and the fourth servant returned come on back back kin to show what he had done and so he gives back what he was given and His Four talents have turned into six because he was willing to give up two to try to make them better to try to use them but there was two that he decided to hide away because he wasn't sure how to use them he wasn't sure if they were really talents or not maybe he was embarrassed because they weren't really good talents you know these these were kind of bent they had notches cut out of them they had different things they weren't they weren't pretty talents and so I don't really want to surrender those or use those thanks for the help buddy and so I think all too often we as Christians fall somewhere into that mix where we're more like a fourth servant we're not going and hiding away all our talents we're not refusing to try to serve the Lord we're not refusing to give him what we have we're just not quite sure about giving everything come ond let's turn to Acts chapter 5 and this is kind of where I got the idea of a fourth servant it's a story we all know well it's the story of annias and saf so Acts chapter 5 starting at verse one it says but a certain man named ananas with saf his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet so the chapter before we're not going to read it but just pause for a moment people were selling off their land and possessions and then were giving the money to the apostles to help take care of the the church that was growing to be able to they would then have funds to live off of they would have funds to help take care of the widows and the orphans and different ones they were selling their extra possessions they weren't necessarily selling the house that they were trying to live in CU they still had to live somewhere but if a person had extra property or had some type of extra possession they would sell it and then give that to the church give that to the apostles and ananas and saf heard about this they knew that this was going on and they decided that they would look bad if they sold their property and didn't give money to the church but they didn't want to give it all I mean they had worked this they had earned this this was their their money they wanted to keep some of it they didn't want to surrender everything or give everything away and sometimes this is one of those where you go into what's not said or what's in between the lines as brother Brandon would talk about in scripture I think if ananas had come to Peter up front and said hey I'm going to give you half the money because I'm keeping the other half for me there would have been no problems Peter would have been like thank you we appreciate you giving to the church Peter wouldn't have yelled at him for not giving the whole amount if he admitted it right up front but ananas wanted to look as holy as everybody else he wanted to look as good as everyone else and so he comes in and puts it down and I don't know whether it's just no explanation let me put it down and just let everyone think what they will or whether it's he actually spoke and said here's the money from my sale of the property scripture doesn't say specifically how he did that part you can imagine it in your own mind but that was what the message came across as the message came across that this is everything and starting at verse three it says but Peter said ananas why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whilst it remained was it not thine own and after it sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou Hast not lied unto men but unto God and ananas hearing these words fell down and gave up The Ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things and the young man arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him now we often talk about ananas ananas and Safara to show that God knows the secrets of our hearts God knows exactly what we're doing even when we think we're doing things in secret but I want to look at this from that other angle for a moment because I think sometimes we can begin to fall into that idea of being like ananas to where we go these are my talents I'm going to give these two up I'll give this Talent OR these talents or I'll give these to God to use but I I'm not ready to give up these talents like I said whether that could be because we're embarrassed because maybe it's something we don't really think is a talent we don't think it's worth anything so why would we give it to God if it's worthless maybe it's something that we just feel like we don't have time to do I don't know we can go through all kinds of reasons of why we wouldn't give the talent to God and not necessarily all the reasons are that man I want to use this for my own gain and my own Improvement I want it to be all about me not about God but we can get up caught up into so many silly reasons to go why God would never use this this isn't worth anything it's not valuable like I said when I described I keep I feel like I keep going back to my daughter again but when I talk about her wanting to be artistic she may never have a talent to sell a thing she may never have a talent that almost anyone else would look at and go yes that's a talent of being artistic and so maybe because that she decides well I'm going to I'm going to be that one that is the light hidden under a bushel I'm going to be that one that I I hide it away because it's not valuable it's not important but yet God's calling her to use that for him to use it for his kingdom to use it in some way for him when brother Brandon was talking about those that have talents and he said have you tried testifying to someone because not everybody can I had never caught that till I was going through those quotes and I was like wait brother brandham said not everybody can testify I thought that was like the most base thing everyone of us could do and in a way all of us can but some people have a talent to testify and connect to people far better than some of the others that you know to use the phrase there's some that go in that it's almost like the bull in the China shot thing you know you're going to hit people over the head with a 2x4 to try to get them to accept Christ and then you've got some that come in and and you know when brother brandom I love the story where he talks about he was going hunting and he was with another brother and they went to ask this Old Gentleman if they could hunt on his property yeah and he just starts talking to him about his apple tree and starts talking to him about uh you know can I have an apple well yeah Hornets are eating them you may as well have one um and then talking to about how old the apple tree and well you know the leaves are starting to fall off well yeah it's about Autumn this is this is normal and going through all these different things and just talking to him talking to him talking to him and he never beat him over the head with you need to accept Christ come on but the way brother brandom said is you give them you give that cow enough rope and it'll hang itself and so he just kept kept feeding it out kept feeding it out until finally the man had to admit well there's some intelligence that is telling that te that tree that the sap should go down to the roots and it's not as brother brandom said you can't just put a bucket of water on a wooden post and the water run down and it'll come back up so it's not just nature telling it to do this now when I read that I'll be the first one to say that I look at that and I go wow I don't know if I could testify to somebody that way yeah come on now I know brother Brandon was a prophet I accept that but he also had a talent for connecting to people yes had the gift of the prophetic gift but he also had the way God designed him he could connect to someone and he knew the right approach to take he didn't come in talking to this guy about cars he was an old farmer so here let's talk about the apple tree let's talk about what's growing here let's talk about what's natural there are some of those that some of us that have that talent that we can testify and we can connect to people and lead them to Christ in a way that others can't because others are the ones wielding the 2x4 to hit people over the head now there are people out in the world that need a 2x4 over the head we understand that and so all of us can testify but the 2x4 doesn't work for most people there like one in a million out there that needs the 2x4 you need to have that other people have that Talent where they can connect to a person and they can begin to tell them how the gospel relates to their life and those are talents and those are talents that we might not think of as talents until brother Branham mentioned it and said have you tried testifying if you don't think you have a talent before I read the quote how many in here thought testifying is a talent okay I I got a couple hands but not many that wasn't something that most of us immediately categorized yes that's a special talent that God gave somebody is to be able to testify now if I asked who many thought how many think singing is a talent I'm gonna get a lot more hands because everybody immedately goes oh yeah that's that's a talent that is a true Talent so God gives each one of us talents and a lot of times they can be that talent that is not recognized that is not identified and all too often it's too easy for us to become the fourth servant that we're willing to surrender some but I don't want him to come back and find me with nothing so let's Hide Away these talents so part of me is like the servant with only one talent because in your mind you're still thinking well you know he's the master that he reaps where he did not seow and he does all these different things and I got I can't come in empty-handed I have to have something to offer so I'll risk these two if I get increased great but if I lose them I've still got two to give back at least I'm not giving him nothing it's all too easy for us to slip into that kind of mindset to slip into the mindset of being the fourth servant where I'm not only hiding the only talent I have I'm not refusing to give God anything but I am refusing to give him everything for whatever reason it may be whether it be completely selfish I want this to be all about me or whether it be something more silly where it's like I'm embarrassed by this I'm afraid people may laugh at me if I tell them I have a talent in modeling with Play-Doh think about whatever it might be but you can become embarrassed to go well that's not I mean that's not singing That's not playing the piano or playing guitar or being up in front where everybody looks at you it's not even the one that every Christian will acknowledge is so amazing to be a prayer Warrior I mean we know that was in the background but every person knows prayer Warrior that is a high calling that is something special and my talent isn't that so would God even want it is it not that important is it something that doesn't matter sometimes we begin to fall into the mindset of that fourth servant because we're getting tired because we've been doing something for so long that we're just getting worn out Galatians chapter 6 verse 9 says and let us not be weary in welld doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 and verse 13 it says but ye Brethren be not weary in well-doing if you've been doing something for a while you've had a talent that you've surrendered to God for quite some time you can begin to get tired you can begin to get worn out and begin to want to move into the mindset of that fourth servant to go God I just want this back I can't use it now I'm just I've poured out everything I don't have anything else to give brother Merl's been leading songs for years he's been leading worship for years and I'm sure there have been times I don't know if he's in this place right now but I'm sure at some point there have been times where he went I'm tired I don't want to do this anymore brother Colby and Sister Mary have been leading the teenage youth group for quite some time and I'm sure there are weeks where they're kind of tired of giving up their Tuesday night to go be with our teenagers I have one in the class so I understand I give mine over too but I'm sure there are times where they're like we'd like our Tuesday night to ourselves we'd like our Tuesday night either with our kids or just the two of us getting to get away they have both been playing instruments and being part of worship here at the church for years and I'm sure there are times when they begin to go I have to get up and play the piano again I have to lead worship again can I just get a week off can I just get a month off can I just step away and not to say that there is anything wrong with taking a vacation or taking a break but there's a difference between going I need a short break to regain energy regain strength whatever and there's difference between going I will never do this again I want my talent back I don't want to surrender this to God anymore because I'm tired we go through seasons of weariness we go through Seasons where we're tired and we have to recuperate and we have to focus on all right God I need you to refill me so that I can keep pouring out right and that's fine for a season but to go into the mindset that it's so easy to get into to go you know I never see anybody else joining the team to help mow the lawn out here so I'm just tired I'm done I never see anybody else coming in to clean the church it's always these four sisters or these Six Sisters these eight sisters or whatever it is I'm done I'm tired of always being the one to do it always tired of being the person to do this role or this piece taking a vacation taking a break because I need to recover because I need to focus on I need God to refill me right now you know brother kby leads worship there are times he needs to step back to get his refilling so that he can then pour back out because he has to spend time and going okay Lord what song should I lead brother Merl the same way what songs will help set the atmosphere what songs will help bring the people up and allow the Holy Spirit to come down so that the minister is able to preach and there's freedom and people are willing to receive this is not an easy role that they have this isn't an easy job when you may go well this is one of the Glamorous ones they get up in front they're in the camera they get to be in the Limelight they're up in the center but there is a lot of responsibility there's a lot of work behind the scenes is there in their own prayer is there in their own study is there in their own time trying to find the leading of the Lord for how the worship should go sometimes we begin sometimes it's easy to forget that that is a Ministry in it of itself that they may not be up here delivering the sermon but they're helping to get everything set it's the same thing for the musicians that surrender that are here every service that get here an hour early before pretty much anybody else so that they can have some time to pray so that they can have some time to read their Bible before they get up to be playing before service to help set the atmosphere before the worship even begins they can get tired yes they can get worn out the people that are cleaning the church can get tired and worn out the sisters that are cooking every Sunday so that we can all gather together can get tired and worn out the brothers that are cleaning and working on the out on the yard and making sure everything's mowed and making sure it's everything trimmed and doing all these things can get tired and worn out the brothers that are doing maintenance inside the building can get tired of always having to come in and deal with this or do touch-ups here or do a repair here or do this or do that and you begin to get that desire to be like the fourth servant and go I want to hide that Talent away I don't want it to be used anymore because I've used it so much I've used it so long and either you're beginning to feel unappreciated or you're beginning to feel just empty because you've poured out time and time again it's easy to fall into that fourth servant mindset of well I'll still give this to God I will still come in and I will still sing and worship as part of the congregation I will be happy sitting there I will still do this but I won't won't do that anymore I will do this but I won't do that whatever it might be and each one of us has different place in our lives where we can go and it doesn't even have to be about in the church are there talents that are we're using outside as we're rubbing shoulders with the world these are talents that we're using that are allowing us to minister to those around us but we're going okay I want to pull that back because I'm tired of it I'm tired of being known as the guy that is always singing worship songs at the jobsite the guys keep making fun of me so I'm just GNA be quiet I'm not going to do anything anymore then they'll leave me alone and I can just work that's what I'm here for I'm just I'm here to work each one of us can have our own thoughts because each one of us has our own talents and the talent that I might think about pulling back is not the same talent that sister fresa might be going well I want to pull that back it might not be the same talent that brother Joe or brother Ken or brother Colby because God has created each one of us different and has created each one of us with our own blending of talents to make us who we are brother William and sister Sharon have their special talents that God has created them with and designed them with with and God has called them to use those talents and yes like I said there are seasons where you step away because you need to recharge you need to refill and that's okay we all know about how Elijah went and was underneath the Juniper Bush and was sleeping because he just needed to rest and God allowed him to sleep fed him allowed him to sleep some more fed him again and and then had him travel again that's right there are times we need to be under that juner bush and that we need to be resting and we need to be recovering but Elijah didn't stay hidden away and never come out and use his callings and talents again he went he stepped away and he rested he stepped away and did got the recovery that he needed and then he went back out onto the field because that's where he was called to go we don't want to be the fourth servant because the fourth servant is so tempting because we're still involved we're straddling that fence where we're still using certain talents we're still giving certain things to God we're still going see Lord I'm still serving you and I'm not trying to say that if you're in that place that that means that you're lost right let's be very clear on that I'm not saying that you're now like ananas and you're going to be thrown out and dropped dead right there because you only gave half but yet God is calling us to surrender everything God is calling us to give him our all and it's tempting to fall into that fourth servant slot for whatever the reason whether it's because we're tired because we're embarrassed because were upset or because of any other reasons that you can think of where you go I don't want to give this to be used I'll serve God I'm using these gifts for you Lord I'm doing what you're calling me to do but I'm not giving up those last two talents I'm not giving up that last one Talent I'm not giving up those last three talents or whatever it might be when Jesus tells the story he makes it very black and white for us you either have a person that's given their all or you have somebody that's given none but yet too often especially in this leoan age we go that lukewarm route and go I'll give some I'll give this much but I'm not going to give it all because of these reasons because of those reasons because of this hurt somebody teased me for that talent and so I don't want to get teased again somebody made fun of me for that and so I don't want to put it back out there and get made fun of again and yet God's still looking at you he's going sister Lona I made you special I created you just to be you and this is what I put in you and this is what what you're supposed to be using looked at brother Caleb sitting in the back and went brother Caleb these are the talents I gave you and I'm calling you to use all of them not just those two or those three but I'm calling you to surrender them all and these might be talents that never get any type of recognition because they're not at that skill level or whatever it's like I've given you this much artistic ability not this much artistic ability I've given you this much musical ability not this much whatever it may be you're just responsible to use the talents that you have been given and the ability that you have been given the three servants are easy to understand they were easy to lay out the one with five talents you used all five five received back the one with two talents used all two got back the one with one used none and so he lost it all but yet it's far too easy and I'm preaching it myself as much as anyone to use some talents and to want to hide others away either because we fail to surrender or because we're hurt or because we just don't see the value in it because we don't think it's important enough that God would want to use it brother brandom said in the sermon Investments as the musicians will go ahead and come he says I'm showing you a real investment to make put your life your time your money your talent put everything you got in Christ God guaranteed this to us by raising him again we'll rise in the last day he promised what more could you look forward to tell me any investment you could make would pay off like that tell me what you can invest in this morning and make $10 million and tomorrow be a corpse what good would it do you what profit a man if he gained the whole world and lose his soul 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and: 10 it says according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another buth thereon but let every man take heed how he builth thereupon for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood haste double every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so is by fire when we surrender our talents to the Lord we're building with gold and silver and precious gems and everything that will hold up to the Flames when we choose to withhold our talent or when we choose to use the talent for our own desires we're building with the wood and hay and [Music] stubble scripture doesn't say that we're lost because we chose to do that doesn't say that we've lost our Salvation because we couldn't fully give over that Talent we were building with the wrong thing says it'll be burned but we'll still have our salvation but how much better is it when we can build and use our talents and build in the right way so there's actually a structure that we can offer and it's not for our Glory we go Lord this is yours I gave the talent to you and you provided the increase this wasn't because of my own wisdom my own smarts my own thoughts that I was able to become better with this talent and become successful with it it's because I surrendered it to you and you were responsible for giving the increase you were responsible for bringing it back twofold fourfold tenfold because I gave it to you and I surrendered it to you it's easy to get tired it's easy to get poured out and empty in this world as we're continually giving we're continually reaching out to those around us but yet God wants to refill us so that we can keep using the talents for him he wants to refill us so that we can keep giving it not leave the battle not go I'll never do this for him again but to go okay let me rest you under the juniper tree let me allow you to rest let me feed you let me restore you so that you can then bring that Talent back in you can then begin using it again the way that you're supposed [Music] to each one of us has those talents and each one of us is at a different place in our journey maybe maybe you are at the point right now where you're like no all my talents are being used for the Lord the way that I should wonderful praise the Lord for it but I think most of us could probably say that there's something in our life there's some talent that okay maybe the Lord could use this a little more than I'm allowing him maybe we're thinking okay I've tried to draw that back and maybe I need to rethink about why I'm doing it is it just that I need to rest so that I can go back or is it that I'm trying to take it away so it can't be used anymore each one of us are at different stages in our journey each one of us are different places and how we're being used but God is calling us to be like the first two servants in the story to give your talents completely and fully over to him to use them completely for his glory for the furtherance of his [Music] kingdom don't be the fourth servant it's easy to fall into that trap because it's not the servant that does nothing it's the servant that doesn't give it all to him brother kobby what are we singing oh [Music] I to thee my blessed savior I surrender all All to Jesus I surrender all to him I freely again I
