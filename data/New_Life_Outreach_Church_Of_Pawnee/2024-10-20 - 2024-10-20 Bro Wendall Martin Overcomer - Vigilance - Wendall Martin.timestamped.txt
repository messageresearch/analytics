[40:00] heat nevertheless we according to his
[40:03] promise look for new heavens and a new
[40:06] Earth wherein dwelleth

[40:56] down as also and his other Epistles
[40:58] speaking in in them of some of these
[41:01] things in which are some things hard to

[41:06] unlearned and unstable
[41:09] wrestle as they do also the other
[41:11] scriptures under their own destruction
[41:14] ye therefore

[42:30] name we pray amen and amen God bless you
[42:35] you may be seated here this
[42:40] morning we want
[42:45] to beware lest you also being led way
[42:49] with the wicked fall from your own
[42:53] steadfastness and we want to be found
[42:55] diligent
[42:57] be diligent that we may be found in him
[42:59] in peace without spot and
[43:01] blameless we know that we're in the
[43:05] coming of the Lord there is there is no
[43:07] doubt in our mind we can see we can see
[43:10] where we are at today amen we we can see
[43:15] uh the world is in the chaotic condition
[43:20] Israel is our time piece as we as we can
[43:24] see uh things that are are taking place
[43:28] there and there there's a power of of of
[43:33] uh Darkness there's a power of of hatred
[43:38] against the Jews we understand that the
[43:42] scripture has has declared in these last
[43:45] days that there would be uh 200,000,000
[43:49] demons that uh would be released from
[43:53] the Euphrates river and there would be
[43:57] great Havoc that be upon the Earth amen
[44:01] first of all it will be upon the Jews as
[44:04] we have a scene that it's not just a
[44:07] natural hatred it's not just amen but
[44:11] there has been a a hatred from Satan
[44:16] against the the the Jews for many years
[44:21] since they have crucified the Lord Jesus
[44:24] there has been uh there that that demon
[44:28] those those Devils have have have been
[44:31] after the Jew and but because they and
[44:36] we understand according to Revelations
[44:38] the 12th chapter amen that it was the
[44:42] Jews that that carried the bloodline of
[44:46] the natural lineage of Jesus and it
[44:48] would be it was the Jews that God first
[44:52] dealt with and amen they were God's
[44:56] people and of course God has has a has
[45:02] um uh provoked them to jealousy by a
[45:05] people who were no people and that is
[45:08] the Gentile bride and because of the the
[45:14] the connection between God and those
[45:17] people the Jews Satan has tried to
[45:20] destroy them and because of the
[45:23] connection of the Bride Satan is out to
[45:26] kill you you and to destroy you and so
[45:30] as I uh Minister here this morning on
[45:33] vigilance amen the word Vigilant means
[45:36] to keep careful watch for possible
[45:40] danger or
[45:42] difficulties it means Wide
[45:44] Awake alert eagley observant attentive
[45:50] on one's guard so to to be uh uh uh
[45:54] Vigilant amen is to is to know your
[45:57] surroundings and know that there is an
[46:00] enemy that that that wants to kill you
[46:04] and uh amen so the opposite of vigilance
[46:08] of course would be negligent inattentive
[46:12] amen
[46:13] unresponsive um uh careless amen and so
[46:16] we we want to in order to resist the
[46:20] devil you've got to know where you are
[46:23] you've got to know who you are You' got
[46:25] to know what he is and I think Amen in
[46:28] order to do that you've got to find your
[46:30] place in scripture and that's why God
[46:32] sent a prophet in this day to point to
[46:35] you the scriptures that is related to
[46:38] you so that you can know how to fight
[46:41] and destroy the enemy amen I I I I do
[46:46] love the um as we listen to
[46:49] Netanyahu uh give his speeches amen he
[46:52] knows who he is and Israel knows who
[46:55] they are and they always point back amen
[46:57] Abraham was our father this nation is
[47:02] founded because God gave it to us this
[47:05] is our land he has he has a root that he
[47:09] can go back to amen it is founded upon
[47:13] the principle of God's word that nation
[47:16] of Israel amen belongs uh uh that that
[47:20] ground belongs to the Jew can you say
[47:23] amen and brother bradam would say for
[47:25] you he would say it's the most glorious
[47:28] time of all ages because we are facing
[47:31] the great Millennium again we're facing
[47:34] the Eden again but right at this age all
[47:38] the deceit all every tactic that he has
[47:42] ever used and has been able to deceive
[47:45] with he's gathered it all together and
[47:48] reinforced himself now this is amen this
[47:52] was there in Satan's Eden there in 65
[47:55] and and so he is saying we are while we
[47:58] are at amen the the brink of the
[48:02] Millennium and while we are we are
[48:04] nearing what we have longed for looked
[48:08] for all of the ages have been looking
[48:11] for this time amen he is saying at this
[48:15] age you've got to remember all of the
[48:18] deceit amen every tactic that God or
[48:21] that Satan has ever used amen that he's
[48:24] able to deceive with all of the horse
[48:27] riders all of the deception is is is
[48:30] being brought in and focused on this one
[48:34] age and that is to prevent the Bride of
[48:37] Jesus Christ and so I think it's I think
[48:40] it's uh important that we that that we
[48:43] not get into a quagmire in our walk with
[48:46] God Amen a quagmire is a you know is a
[48:49] soft boggy area of ground that gives way
[48:52] under your foot and amen you know where
[48:55] you can't you you you you can't stand
[48:58] solidly and it's Amen you you just
[49:01] you're sinking in the ground but God's
[49:03] given us a solid ground it's divine
[49:06] revelation Satan comes out and he has
[49:09] presented a religion without a
[49:11] foundation there is no Foundation it's
[49:13] not there's nothing to really put your
[49:15] faith upon but the Gospel of Jesus
[49:18] Christ is solid it does have a
[49:20] foundation that Foundation is Jesus
[49:23] Christ and we are built upon Jesus
[49:25] Christ and the adop doctrines of the
[49:27] Apostles and I I I say today we we we we
[49:31] should we should be thankful for the
[49:33] doctrines that these amen that God has
[49:35] given us through the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:38] and those Apostles can you say amen amen
[49:41] God has pulled us the scripture says
[49:44] he's pulled us out of the Miry clay and
[49:47] he has set our feet upon a rock that is
[49:50] secure that Solid Rock Amen and so uh uh
[49:55] uh those swampy spirits have no hold you
[49:57] know those swamp you know swamp is a low
[50:01] lying uncultivated amen ground where
[50:04] water collects and amen it's just
[50:06] Wasteland there's there there you can't
[50:08] build anything on it it's just swampy
[50:11] but God's called you out of that now
[50:14] amen sometimes we get swampy in our in
[50:16] our thinking we get swampy in our walk
[50:19] with God we get swampy in our prayer
[50:21] life we get swampy in our Amen in our
[50:25] relationship with the Lord amen and and
[50:28] and again amen it's it's just
[50:30] uncultivated ground but God doesn't want
[50:33] swamping God wants solid Christians
[50:37] built upon the solid revelation of who
[50:40] he is well praise the Lord amen I'm
[50:44] going to tell you it's not God's will
[50:45] for you to have a muddled up spirit amen
[50:48] a mind of confusion a mind that is that
[50:50] that that has no peace and has no joy I
[50:54] I I I'm here to tell you we are in the
[50:57] last of the last there should be Joy
[51:00] there should be peace there should be
[51:02] love there should be perseverance there
[51:05] should be vigilance because we are on
[51:08] the last leg of the journey how many
[51:11] believes that the Rapture is is Right
[51:13] Upon Us amen I uh we were talking the
[51:16] other night amen I was talking uh we we
[51:18] were sitting there talking with Brother
[51:20] John and sister April and I said you
[51:22] know it it it could be just just just
[51:24] like this where we're just sitting amen
[51:27] and and and and then amen right right
[51:30] before our right here with us and the
[51:33] Rapture take place I believe it's coming
[51:35] I believe it's here I I listen Friends
[51:38] The Rapture is upon us I do not believe
[51:43] the Rapture is in another generation I
[51:46] believe the Rapture amen is so close to
[51:50] us it could be this very moment it could
[51:54] be this morning and we must be Vigilant
[51:57] against that enemy well can you say amen
[52:00] amen a muddled up spirit is to busy
[52:02] yourself Amen in a confusing or
[52:05] ineffective way a muddle up spirit is
[52:07] just running around without purpose a
[52:10] muddle up spirit amen is doing things
[52:13] that that that that really doesn't have
[52:15] a purpose brethren we need to keep one
[52:17] thing in mind and that is the coming of
[52:20] the Lord Jesus Christ amen while we're
[52:22] working amen while we're raising our
[52:24] family while we're playing Amen on the
[52:27] playground amen there should be one
[52:29] desire and that is to make this
[52:33] Rapture amen I believe that amen now now
[52:37] why is the world in a in a in an
[52:40] identity crisis why do we have boys and
[52:44] girls trying to figure out who they are
[52:46] and why amen do we have so many the the
[52:49] world is in a huge identity crisis and
[52:53] and the reason they're in this huge
[52:55] identity crisis amen is because they
[52:58] have forsaken the way of life amen and
[53:03] and it and it gets into a amen the
[53:05] church has got into that state of
[53:07] identity crisis until amen we don't know
[53:10] what part of the word we're going to
[53:11] believe and what part of the word we're
[53:13] not going to believe I amen well brother
[53:15] teaches it this way and this brother
[53:17] teaches it that way well you know I I
[53:20] just believe that we need to just read
[53:22] the Bible and believe it for what it
[53:24] says believe it for what it says believe
[53:27] the scriptures come back to scripture
[53:30] amen because this is the only thing that
[53:33] is going to keep us in this time now
[53:36] remember Satan wants to bind you to
[53:40] himself amen and that's what sin is has
[53:44] has has come in and the and the immoral
[53:46] things that have that have come and amen
[53:49] and Satan wants to bind you I I I think
[53:53] there is there is nothing any any any
[53:56] great greater uh binding power than
[53:58] Darkness Darkness amen secrecy I I it it
[54:03] keeps it it it it keeps you from amen
[54:06] knowing what what is out there amen you
[54:09] don't know what is out there you don't
[54:10] know where you're at you don't know amen
[54:13] because of the of the of the darkness
[54:16] around and secrecy even of sin you
[54:20] allowing sin secret sins allowing
[54:23] secrets between you know uh uh uh you
[54:26] and your wife allowing secrets between
[54:29] you know the secret sins and hiding them
[54:32] in your life it it keeps the spirit of
[54:36] God away from you it muddles it muddles
[54:39] up your mind amen because you know that
[54:42] sin is is is not is not right you also
[54:45] know that God knows that sin is there
[54:47] amen so so instead of Satan binding us
[54:51] to to these secret sins I believe it's
[54:55] time for us to be diligent and to bring
[54:58] these sins before God Amen confess them
[55:01] openly and say God I don't want these
[55:04] sins in my
[55:06] life well praise the Lord God has came
[55:10] with an open book God has revealed
[55:14] himself Amen in such Clarity today so
[55:17] that you can have a way of overcoming
[55:22] the evil one in this dark and gross uh
[55:26] this gross dark generation can you say
[55:28] amen amen that's right and so you just
[55:32] remember this when Satan has an
[55:34] impediment against you when Satan has
[55:37] something on you he can hold that
[55:39] against you and every time you try to
[55:41] rise above it every time you try to rise
[55:44] above it amen H H Satan will say but you
[55:48] know but you know and and before you
[55:51] know it amen you're you're you're you're
[55:53] back down in the chicken pin again amen
[55:56] why because Satan's got a little string
[55:58] on your finger or on on your on your leg
[56:01] amen when you should be up fly flying
[56:04] and saring in the heavens Satan's got
[56:06] you
[56:08] Earthbound I say it's time to get rid of
[56:10] sin in our lives amen well praise the
[56:13] Lord amen Satan there condemning you
[56:15] there's one thing that Satan condemns
[56:16] you on Amen and and he and he doesn't
[56:18] have no strongholds amen he's lying
[56:20] against you he can can listen you can
[56:23] accuse me well I forgive you brother
[56:25] wend for for going out and getting drunk
[56:27] and amen well I guess you could if I if
[56:30] I had got out and got drunk but if I
[56:32] never got drunk if I've not been drunk
[56:35] then you then there's nothing you can
[56:37] hold against me can you say amen and so
[56:40] we want to make sure that the sins that
[56:44] the sins of our of our spirit and our
[56:47] body and and our soul amen are covered
[56:51] beneath the blood of Jesus Amen and I
[56:54] don't believe in that dirty Grace I I I
[56:57] I just simply believe that the blood of
[56:59] Jesus is able to forgive you of your
[57:01] sins and it's also able to deliver you
[57:05] from the power of sin where you no
[57:07] longer have to go back out and do the
[57:10] things of the world you are free from
[57:13] sin well bless the name of the Lord amen
[57:17] but but the church has taken on that
[57:19] amen that hypocrisy spirit amen it's a
[57:22] religious spirit that'll let us set in a
[57:25] church let let us pray let us go through
[57:28] the forms and while there are sins in
[57:31] our lives amen and it's holding us from
[57:33] Victory it's holding us from from praise
[57:36] it's holding us from amen overcoming the
[57:39] devil therefore we're defeated therefore
[57:42] we're discouraged therefore we are
[57:44] powerless but I want to tell you today
[57:46] the blood of Jesus is still powerful
[57:48] today if there is a man in a woman that
[57:50] is willing to rise in the power and say
[57:53] God I I want to bring every sin I want
[57:56] to lay it at Calvary and I want to leave
[57:59] it there well is there anyone else that
[58:01] wants to be free from the power of sin
[58:04] God I believe it was the psalmist it
[58:06] says Lord take forgive me and take away
[58:11] even my hidden secret sins Amen Let Me
[58:15] Hide Your word if there's going to be
[58:17] any hiding going on let me hide your
[58:19] word in my heart amen if there's going
[58:21] to be any if there's going to be any
[58:23] secrecy going on let it be a secret
[58:26] prayer in the prayer chamber let me get
[58:29] a hold of you I want your power in my
[58:33] life amen that's right Hallelujah
[58:37] Delilah Satan was able to find what was
[58:40] going on with Eve found where the power
[58:43] was at amen and and and it sold us all
[58:46] into into sickness and death amen that
[58:49] we're in today Delilah found the secret
[58:52] to uh to Samson's strength amen and he
[58:55] laid it her lap too long he thought that
[58:58] he could overcome he thought that he
[59:00] could and he did amen many of times he
[59:02] was laying in her lap and amen and and
[59:06] and and she says the Philistines are on
[59:07] you and he jumped up and strong as he
[59:10] ever was but there came a time where she
[59:13] found his secret amen and when he jumped
[59:16] up he had no power there he was
[59:19] powerless well praise the Lord and I say
[59:22] we're in that D today where the church
[59:25] has has lost its power because the enemy
[59:30] has found where her strength is you get
[59:33] bogged down you get away from God's word
[59:36] and you get muddled up in your mind you
[59:38] get bogged down in your spirit and you
[59:41] have no Authority with God but come back
[59:43] to the Bible come back to the absolute
[59:46] come back to a faith that'll believe
[59:48] God's word and I'm going to believe it I
[59:51] don't care what brother says sister says
[59:53] what the Pope says what what the
[59:55] preacher says what anything would say
[59:57] that would take me away from the word of
[59:59] God I want to stand up on
[1:00:02] that Hallelujah well can you say Amen
[1:00:05] why would you allow the devil to hold
[1:00:09] things over your head when you have the
[1:00:11] ability to bring him to God and put them
[1:00:14] under the blood of Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ why would you amen set there in
[1:00:20] your pride and allow the devil to keep
[1:00:24] you from being powerful I say today it's
[1:00:26] time for us to do some house cleaning
[1:00:29] some soul searching and get those Devils
[1:00:32] off of our back because we are
[1:00:37] victorious you young people are
[1:00:39] victorious you m and daddies are
[1:00:41] victorious you preachers are victorious
[1:00:43] God's called us to Divine
[1:00:45] Victory can you say
[1:00:47] Amen you weren't created to shine the
[1:00:50] devil's
[1:00:51] shoes you weren't created to amen pack
[1:00:55] his bag
[1:00:56] amen you're created to to to to follow
[1:01:00] the lord Jesus Christ just once more the
[1:01:03] prophet would say if that isn't just
[1:01:05] about the way the enemy likes to do when
[1:01:08] he's when he can get you down but he
[1:01:10] doesn't dare try as long as the power of
[1:01:13] God is operating through the church amen
[1:01:15] he he would be afraid to do that when
[1:01:17] the Nazarite blessings upon you but if
[1:01:19] he can see you whipped that's when he
[1:01:21] makes fun of you and that's when he can
[1:01:24] see can say there's no difference
[1:01:26] between them and us they're just the
[1:01:29] same uh man like we are amen but there's
[1:01:32] something different something
[1:01:34] outstanding with Jehovah's blessings
[1:01:35] upon it amen then they're scared to say
[1:01:38] anything can you say amen I want to be
[1:01:42] that kind of an
[1:01:44] individual hallelujah amen I I I I I I
[1:01:49] I've you know I told some a young person
[1:01:52] the other day I said well amen if if if
[1:01:55] you don't want to hear Mama's uh uh uh
[1:01:57] uh and Daddy's complaining to you and
[1:02:00] and and getting on to you so much then
[1:02:02] maybe you ought to stop and and think a
[1:02:05] little bit about what they're saying
[1:02:06] that's getting you in trouble
[1:02:09] hallelujah amen I would rather have the
[1:02:12] blessings of mom and dad than to have
[1:02:14] the Wrath amen give me a heart that is
[1:02:17] willing to follow the lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:21] amen amen well is that all right here
[1:02:24] this morning Hallelujah I said is that
[1:02:26] all right here this morning amen I say
[1:02:30] expose the devil that wants to shame you
[1:02:35] expose that devil that is wanting to
[1:02:37] keep you under his under his thumb can
[1:02:40] you say amen and I believe that the
[1:02:42] greatest thing that we could do is to be
[1:02:45] identified with God if you're going to
[1:02:47] identify yourself with God you're going
[1:02:48] to have to identify yourself with
[1:02:51] humility because you cannot serve God in
[1:02:54] the world at the same time
[1:02:56] you've got to humble yourself amen and
[1:02:59] walk with God Amen in identifi the
[1:03:01] identified Christ of all ages 64 it says
[1:03:04] that's the way we find God when we take
[1:03:07] off our pride lay it down walk up into
[1:03:11] his presence and listen to that voice
[1:03:14] identify I am that I am I am the god of
[1:03:19] Abraham Isaac and of Jacob I remember my
[1:03:23] promise I see the condition can you say
[1:03:26] amen amen another one he would say
[1:03:28] that's the way he does it amen what did
[1:03:31] he do it he says he said by identifying
[1:03:34] himself in his characteristics in the
[1:03:37] Supernatural and the supernatural
[1:03:39] sometimes is so phenomenal that it gets
[1:03:41] away from the people and the people get
[1:03:44] you know get to be good people nice
[1:03:46] people amen but sometimes they just
[1:03:49] understand it amen and misunderstanding
[1:03:51] and I I say God I want the supernatural
[1:03:54] in every day of my life
[1:03:57] I I want to get so part of the
[1:03:58] supernatural amen that that I have a
[1:04:01] hard time amen uh uh uh uh finding
[1:04:05] walking in the natural can you say Amen
[1:04:08] now we understand that we're living in
[1:04:10] the precursor of The Sixth Seal the
[1:04:13] fifth and The Sixth Seal is is we we we
[1:04:16] we understand that the Judgment of of

[1:04:41] and Magog is is amen the the the the the
[1:04:46] steps are being uh uh put in
[1:04:49] position where all of the world is going
[1:04:51] to turn against Israel amen the devil's
[1:04:55] are going to try to to destroy Israel
[1:04:59] and they're going to fight they're going
[1:05:00] to have they they've going to have some
[1:05:02] they're going to have some Bloodshed can
[1:05:04] you say amen amen but we also know that
[1:05:07] it's going to be the
[1:05:09] supernatural presence of God that comes
[1:05:12] down and fights for
[1:05:14] Israel it's going to be God coming down
[1:05:17] with earthquakes and amen and Bible says
[1:05:19] wind and and tornadoes and there's going
[1:05:22] to be come there's going to be things
[1:05:24] that come against these that are trying
[1:05:27] to destroy Israel because Israel we
[1:05:32] understand that God's dealing with
[1:05:34] Israel bringing Israel back to that
[1:05:37] Homeland not just Jerusalem amen but
[1:05:41] back to himself they were the blood of
[1:05:44] Jesus Christ has has redeemed them can
[1:05:47] you say Amen now I I want us to just

[1:06:11] see that there is some
[1:06:14] real uh evil Powers working against
[1:06:17] Israel right
[1:06:18] now these nations are what what has
[1:06:22] Israel ever done to the Palestinians
[1:06:25] what has Israel ever done Amen to to to
[1:06:29] Lebanon and those except for bringing
[1:06:32] blessings to them they don't come in
[1:06:34] there and trying to to kill their
[1:06:36] children or try matters of fact amen
[1:06:38] Israel's got all kinds of of of uh uh uh
[1:06:42] you know Arabs that live there in the
[1:06:43] nation of
[1:06:45] Israel they sure do amen they sure do so
[1:06:49] they're not trying to go out and kill
[1:06:51] and and Destroy but there is an evil
[1:06:54] spirit
[1:06:56] that is
[1:06:57] orchestrating amen uh the these nations
[1:07:01] to fight against
[1:07:03] Israel did you know that the Bible says
[1:07:06] that it was going to happen the Bible
[1:07:08] says it was going to happen amen and
[1:07:11] there is a reason for it happening
[1:07:15] Israel must get her eyes off of herself
[1:07:19] off of the prosperity of her land and
[1:07:22] she's got to turn her heart to the true
[1:07:26] atonement which is Jesus Christ she has
[1:07:29] got to accept the atonement now right
[1:07:32] now she's still amen under the blood of
[1:07:34] bulls and goats and they still doing
[1:07:36] those kinds of things but Israel well
[1:07:39] listen folks amen the Gentile church is
[1:07:42] fixing to be caught up God is is is
[1:07:46] moving his attention from the Gentiles
[1:07:49] back to the Jews and he's preparing the
[1:07:53] Jews Hallelujah you know what I really
[1:07:56] believe I believe that there is Moses
[1:07:58] and Elijah I believe the spirit of Moses
[1:08:01] and the spirit of Elijah is there in
[1:08:04] Israel right now I believe that there
[1:08:07] are the two prophets over there right
[1:08:09] now I believe amen that things are
[1:08:12] transpiring and getting ready well you
[1:08:15] might not believe it you don't have to
[1:08:17] amen but I'm here to tell you I believe
[1:08:19] we're that
[1:08:21] close sir Hallelujah when you see all
[1:08:25] these nations turning against when you
[1:08:27] see amen the hatred the ha come on
[1:08:30] church amen look at the hatred in the
[1:08:32] United States for look look at the
[1:08:34] hatred all around the world for the Jews
[1:08:36] that's taking place right now these are
[1:08:38] devils but what are those Devils to do
[1:08:42] drive them back to their Homeland and
[1:08:45] that Homeland is not just is not just
[1:08:48] Israel but to know the Lord Jesus
[1:08:51] Christ amen now amen Revelation 6 and9
[1:08:56] it says when he had opened the fifth
[1:08:57] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[1:09:00] them that were slain for the word of God
[1:09:03] Amen let's see
[1:09:07] um praise the
[1:09:11] Lord
[1:09:13] um where am I at see nine oh the fifth
[1:09:16] seal okay when under the fifth seal I
[1:09:18] saw of the altar of the souls them that
[1:09:21] were slain for the word of God and for
[1:09:23] the testimony which they laid now I I
[1:09:25] want to I want to just say here the Jews
[1:09:26] so since the time of that Israel has uh
[1:09:30] was since they rejected Christ and Titus
[1:09:33] came in amen and they have been and they
[1:09:36] have and and they were scattered across
[1:09:38] every nation in the earth amen this they
[1:09:41] those Souls that are they they all under
[1:09:44] that fifth seal all under that altar
[1:09:46] amen it says for the testimony which
[1:09:48] they had and they cried how long amen uh
[1:09:52] saying uh uh how long oh Lord holy
[1:09:55] intrude does thou not judge and avenge
[1:09:57] our blood on them that dwell on the
[1:10:00] earth and white robes were given unto
[1:10:03] every one of them and it was said unto
[1:10:05] them that they should rest yet for a
[1:10:08] little season until their fellow
[1:10:11] servants also and their Brethren should
[1:10:14] be killed as they were should be
[1:10:16] fulfilled and so we're understanding
[1:10:19] that that is the Jewish seal that is the
[1:10:22] fifth seal it doesn't come into its
[1:10:24] fullness until after the church so I
[1:10:26] want you to understand amen the the the
[1:10:28] seal is going to be amen but we're in
[1:10:31] the precursor of the opening of this
[1:10:34] what we are seeing in the in the hatred
[1:10:37] for the Jew today amen what is it going
[1:10:40] to be when the church has taken out when
[1:10:44] the Rapture has taken place can you say
[1:10:47] Amen now we know that the fifth seal and
[1:10:49] The Sixth Seal amen is the Great
[1:10:51] Tribulation it's going they they happen
[1:10:53] amen consecutively they're in the 12th
[1:10:55] verse 612 of Revelations I beheld and
[1:10:58] when he' opened the six seal and oh
[1:11:00] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[1:11:02] become black a sackcloth of hair and and
[1:11:05] the moon become as blood and the stars
[1:11:08] of Heaven fell unto the Earth as a fig
[1:11:10] tree casteth her untimely figs when she
[1:11:13] is uh shaken of A Mighty Wind and the
[1:11:16] and the heavens uh Heaven departed as a
[1:11:18] scroll when it rolled together and every
[1:11:21] mountain and Island were moved out of
[1:11:22] its place and the kings of the earth and
[1:11:24] the great men and the rich men and the
[1:11:25] captains and the Mighty Men And every
[1:11:27] bondman and every
[1:11:29] Freeman hid themselves in dens and rocks
[1:11:32] of mountains and said to the rocks and
[1:11:34] mountains fall on us and hide us from
[1:11:37] the face of him that sth upon the throne
[1:11:39] from the Wrath of the lamb for that
[1:11:41] great day of his wrath has come who is
[1:11:43] able to stand and so we we we understand
[1:11:47] that this is this is the precursor this
[1:11:49] is this is the the the setting up the
[1:11:51] foundation has being has been laid for
[1:11:54] for this that is taking place amen it's
[1:11:57] a it's a place where the world is is
[1:11:59] full of chaos amen it's a it's a place
[1:12:02] where the word of God is is totally amen
[1:12:05] been mutilated and amen and and
[1:12:08] dissected and and set aside it's a place
[1:12:11] where Jesus Christ is no longer revered
[1:12:14] and loved amen it's a place that Sinners
[1:12:16] no longer come to an altar to to to get
[1:12:19] changed in their heart and get changed
[1:12:22] in their lives amen they just come up
[1:12:23] and shake a preacher's hand and still go
[1:12:26] out there and live in sin and smoke
[1:12:28] their dope and drink their booze and
[1:12:31] amen and do those kinds of things there
[1:12:33] is nothing there amen there is no
[1:12:35] conviction in the heart because of the
[1:12:38] evil spirits that are all around and
[1:12:40] church I want to tell you that that that
[1:12:43] that devil is here to interpret the word
[1:12:45] of God to you too amen oh yeah you might
[1:12:47] say well I don't drink and I don't cut
[1:12:51] cuss and I don't do this but but the
[1:12:53] devil is right there to turn turn your
[1:12:55] attention away from the word of God and
[1:12:57] giving your everything and being
[1:12:59] vigilant amen and being and being on
[1:13:01] fire for the word of God he can you say
[1:13:04] Amen what was God's desire amen what did
[1:13:07] God pronounce there in this church age
[1:13:09] he says Thou sayest that you are amen uh
[1:13:12] rich and increase with good but I say

[1:13:28] longer mean you you don't claim to be a
[1:13:30] sinner you don't claim to be someone on
[1:13:32] fire amen you know those are just
[1:13:34] Fanatics amen those are just brandom
[1:13:37] eyeses that's just window Martin over
[1:13:38] there at that church but you're lukewarm
[1:13:41] you'll go to church occasionally amen
[1:13:43] you'll say Amen occasionally amen but I
[1:13:46] want to tell you I'll spew you out of my
[1:13:49] mouth the day of judgment is coming
[1:13:52] someone say it with me the day of of
[1:13:55] judgment is coming amen the wrath of God
[1:13:59] is fixing to be poured out but there is
[1:14:02] a church who has accepted the blood of
[1:14:06] Jesus Christ and has taken the atonement
[1:14:10] and said I want to be
[1:14:14] washed can you say Amen
[1:14:18] Now We're

[1:14:48] bottomless pit and he opened the
[1:14:51] bottomless pit and there arose a smoke
[1:14:54] out of the pit as the smoke of a great
[1:14:56] furnace and the Sun and the air were

[1:18:40] shall men seek death and it shall not
[1:18:42] find it and it shall desire to die and
[1:18:46] Death Shall flee them amen and the
[1:18:48] shapes of the Locust were as under like
[1:18:51] under horses prepared under battle on
[1:18:53] their heads were as that were crowns
[1:18:55] like gold and their faces were as faces
[1:18:58] of men and they had hair as the hair of
[1:19:01] women and they had teeth as the teeth of
[1:19:04] lions and they had breastplates and as
[1:19:06] it were breastplates of iron the sound
[1:19:09] of their wings was as the sound of
[1:19:10] Chariots and many horses running to
[1:19:13] battle and they had tails like under
[1:19:16] scorpions and there were stings in their
[1:19:18] tails and and their power was to hurt
[1:19:21] men for five months and they had a king
[1:19:24] over them which is the Angel of the
[1:19:26] bottomless pit which name whose name in
[1:19:28] the Hebrew tongue is abidan but in the
[1:19:31] Greek tongue hath his name aoleon amen
[1:19:35] and so so we we we find that that that
[1:19:39] these are now these are not literal the
[1:19:41] prophet told us these are not literal
[1:19:43] scorpions and literal Locust but these
[1:19:46] are demons amen that have that have come
[1:19:50] to Earth and people are going now
[1:19:53] brother brandom says before the coming
[1:19:54] of the Lord the Earth would just go
[1:19:57] insane amen that they would see things
[1:20:00] amen mental illness would rise amen why
[1:20:04] because of of the sin that is prevailing
[1:20:07] upon the church amen upon the Earth can
[1:20:11] you say amen amen so so we understand
[1:20:15] that we're living in the in in the days
[1:20:19] where the wrath of God is fixing to be
[1:20:23] poured out amen this requires
[1:20:27] vigilance somebody say help me to be
[1:20:30] vigilant me be vigilant this requires
[1:20:33] men and women who know how to pray and
[1:20:37] spend time in prayer and calling out to
[1:20:40] God Amen and oh I want to tell you even
[1:20:43] in the time of all the darkness even in
[1:20:45] the time of all of the sin and the
[1:20:47] perversions and and the smoke out of
[1:20:49] that bottomless pit there is a blood
[1:20:52] that will sanctify the elect there is a
[1:20:55] blood be vigilant walk with God live
[1:20:58] with God stay with God Amen be vigilant
[1:21:02] about
[1:21:03] it amen now so we can see the fifth
[1:21:07] seal has to do with the Jews we have the
[1:21:10] Sixth Seal which is the Great
[1:21:11] Tribulation amen we understand that the
[1:21:14] ninth chapter amen is is when the minds
[1:21:18] are going to be so darkened amen and the
[1:21:21] evil spirits are going to take over
[1:21:24] praise the Lord amen now hallelujah it's
[1:21:28] in that day that the two
[1:21:33] 100,000,000 devils are going to be
[1:21:35] released out of the
[1:21:37] Euphrates amen now amen if you were to
[1:21:43] read the ninth chapter the sixth or the
[1:21:45] 13th verse and the sixth Angel sounded
[1:21:48] and I Heard a Voice from the four horns
[1:21:51] of the golden altar which is before God
[1:21:53] saying the sixth Angel which the trumpet
[1:21:55] loose the Four Angels which are bound in
[1:21:58] the great river Euphrates and the Four
[1:22:01] Angels were loose which were prepared
[1:22:03] for an hour and a day and a month and a
[1:22:05] year to slay the third part of mountain
[1:22:07] and the number of the army of the
[1:22:08] horsemen that were 200,000,000 that's 2
[1:22:11] million and and I heard the number of
[1:22:14] them amen and thus I saw the horses in
[1:22:17] the vision and and them that sat on them
[1:22:20] having breastplates of fire and of zinc
[1:22:23] and and brimstone and the heads of the
[1:22:25] horses were as the heads of lions and
[1:22:27] out of their mouths issue fire and smoke
[1:22:29] and brimstone and by these three was the
[1:22:32] third part of man killed and by the fire
[1:22:35] by the smoke and by the brimstone which
[1:22:37] issued out of their mouths for their
[1:22:40] power is in their mouth and in their
[1:22:42] tails for their tails were as serpents
[1:22:45] and and had heads and with them they do
[1:22:48] hurt and the rest of the men which were
[1:22:51] not killed by these plagues yet repented
[1:22:53] not of the works of their hands that
[1:22:55] they should not worship devils and Idols
[1:22:58] of gold and silver and brass and stone
[1:23:01] and of wood which neither can see nor
[1:23:03] hear nor walk neither repented they of
[1:23:06] the murders uh nor of their sorceries
[1:23:08] nor of their fornication nor of their
[1:23:10] thefts now now this is this is this is
[1:23:13] the this is the demon powers that are
[1:23:16] coming upon the Earth and hopefully I'm
[1:23:18] I'm going to bring this all together to
[1:23:20] make sense you know when you're reading
[1:23:22] the book of Revelations these things are
[1:23:24] done in symbol form amen and this is the
[1:23:27] same thing here this is not literal uh

[1:23:36] powers what is the Beast a beast is a
[1:23:39] power amen the 200,000 Horsemen these
[1:23:44] are demons that are going to be released
[1:23:47] that have been released in this final
[1:23:50] day amen now now you say well I I just
[1:23:55] don't know about that amen well that's
[1:23:57] why we need to be listening to the
[1:23:58] message of the hour because the prophet
[1:24:00] of God told us these things and when you
[1:24:03] when you hear these things and you look
[1:24:05] at these things then you understand why
[1:24:08] the preacher preaches that there should
[1:24:09] be some fervency and and and I preach
[1:24:12] that there should be uh uh don't don't
[1:24:15] don't allow anything anything somebody
[1:24:17] say nothing allow nothing in your lives
[1:24:21] don't let the devil interpret the word
[1:24:25] to you in any way don't let him miscue
[1:24:29] anything to you he done it in one area
[1:24:33] of of of Eve's life and here we are
[1:24:35] today I say in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:24:44] day amen it feels can you say Amen what
[1:24:49] are we fighting today amen though you've
[1:24:51] got the blood of Jesus Christ you're
[1:24:53] you're you're you're you're fighting
[1:24:55] those Devils amen those 200,000,000
[1:24:58] Devils that are after Jews they're also
[1:25:01] after us brother Bram would say when
[1:25:03] Hitler and them persecuted the
[1:25:05] Jews and did the things that they' done
[1:25:07] Stalin and Hitler and those dictators
[1:25:10] had raised up if we had the time which
[1:25:12] to rehearse it to to some newcomers but
[1:25:15] but we but we've went through it and
[1:25:17] under the same age where uh that there
[1:25:20] had been in Germany and and the other
[1:25:23] nations and the Jews it's scattered
[1:25:24] throughout all the land H H but there
[1:25:27] has raised in the in the last 20 years a
[1:25:30] bitter persecution against the Jews I
[1:25:33] I've I've been out there in the the old
[1:25:34] places where they burnt their bodies and
[1:25:36] cremated and their Ashes to fertilize
[1:25:38] the ground Jewish children women and
[1:25:41] everything and and they tried to deny it
[1:25:43] and try to and take them right out and
[1:25:46] show them where it was done amen it's
[1:25:48] been a bitter persecution against Israel
[1:25:50] because it's been the time calling him
[1:25:53] back to the atonement he is still under
[1:25:55] the atonement of a natural lamb when the
[1:25:57] real Lamb of God is the atonement and
[1:26:00] he's rejected it and the blood has been
[1:26:02] upon him ever since notice making ready

[1:27:36] Roman it's the same Spirit they done the
[1:27:40] same thing that they did to the
[1:27:41] Christians in the old Pagan Roman days
[1:27:43] now watch the natural Israel and the
[1:27:47] spiritual church now as we separated

[1:31:54] scriptures talking about in the last
[1:31:55] days and uh amen now now those we
[1:31:59] understand that there's been Devils that
[1:32:01] have been called out with all those
[1:32:02] Nations have all been called out Gog and
[1:32:05] Magog we we understand that that's the
[1:32:07] prince of Russia is going to come down
[1:32:10] and there's amen and and and if you were
[1:32:12] to see the the map of of all of those
[1:32:14] that have that have been prophesied to
[1:32:16] come against Israel that I mean they're
[1:32:18] all going to come down that's already
[1:32:19] been prophesied it's in Ezekiel amen it

[1:32:25] come on now and and God's going to fight
[1:32:28] for her and and and all of that but
[1:32:30] before that can take place we've got to
[1:32:33] be out of here we're not going to be
[1:32:35] here for that
[1:32:37] persecution we're we're now listen amen
[1:32:40] the great the six seal is the Judgment
[1:32:43] of the wrath of God that's the great
[1:32:45] persecution upon the great and her
[1:32:48] daughters that's when the persecution is
[1:32:51] amen that's when the wrath of God is
[1:32:52] going to be poured out out the Great
[1:32:54] Tribulation no man will be able to buy
[1:32:56] or sell unless the pope gives him that
[1:32:58] permission unless you belong to the to
[1:33:01] that uh World Council of churches it's
[1:33:03] all being set up but what what I'm
[1:33:05] saying it's in the invisible Rim you
[1:33:07] don't see those things that are taking
[1:33:10] place but you can see what is taking
[1:33:12] place to Natural Israel when it's taking
[1:33:15] place in natural Israel I want you to
[1:33:17] know there must be a bride before God
[1:33:21] goes to Israel there must be a bride
[1:33:24] that is caught

[1:37:11] to fall in line because that's what
[1:37:13] God's spirit
[1:37:16] does Amen so I think I think these
[1:37:18] things are very very prudent and and
[1:37:21] very pertinent for our day but second
[1:37:23] Timothy Timothy 4:1 I charge thee
[1:37:25] therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
[1:37:27] Christ who shall judge the living and
[1:37:29] the dead at is appearing in his kingdom

[1:37:33] out of season reprove rebuke exhort with
[1:37:36] all longsuffering and Doctrine for the
[1:37:38] time will come when they will not endure
[1:37:40] sound Doctrine but after their own lust
[1:37:43] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[1:37:45] having itching ears and they shall turn
[1:37:47] away their ears from the truth and shall
[1:37:50] be turned into fables but watch thou in
[1:37:52] all things endure afflictions do the
[1:37:54] work of evangelist make full proof of
[1:37:56] the ministry now the Apostle Paul is
[1:37:57] saying there's coming a time where
[1:37:59] they're going to Heap to themselves
[1:38:02] teachers are we not living in a day
[1:38:04] where you can we got all of these we got
[1:38:06] all of these mega churches with the mega
[1:38:08] preachers with uh everything else
[1:38:10] heaping to themselves Mega preachers
[1:38:13] teachers and they're teaching them what
[1:38:15] they want them to know they're turned to
[1:38:17] fables you can't you can no more get the
[1:38:20] gospel out of what you're
[1:38:22] hearing right but there is a bride who
[1:38:24] is preparing there's a bride who is
[1:38:27] preparing and she's reading her Bible

[1:38:33] his only begotten son that's wonderful
[1:38:35] he saved you now what what does he want
[1:38:37] you to do that now that you're saved

[1:38:41] more of the Bible can you say Amen 1
[1:38:44] Peter 2 and one amen it says and there
[1:38:46] were false prophets among the people
[1:38:49] even as there shall be false teachers
[1:38:50] among you who privately shall bring in
[1:38:54] damnable heresies even denying the Lord
[1:38:57] that bought them and bring upon
[1:38:59] themselves Swift
[1:39:00] destruction and many shall follow their
[1:39:02] pernicious ways this is to the church
[1:39:04] now pernicious Ways by reason of whom
[1:39:07] the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
[1:39:09] now preachers anointed to preach against
[1:39:12] the truth imagine that it says through
[1:39:15] covetousness they with Fain words make
[1:39:18] merchandise of you whose judgment now of
[1:39:21] a long time lingere Earth not in their
[1:39:22] damnation suth not for if God spared not
[1:39:25] the angels that sinned but cast them
[1:39:27] down to Hell and delivering them into
[1:39:29] the chains of Darkness to be reserved
[1:39:31] into judgment and spared not the old
[1:39:33] world but saved Noah the eighth person a
[1:39:36] preacher of righteousness bringing in
[1:39:38] the flood upon the world of the ungodly
[1:39:40] and turning the cities of Sodom and
[1:39:42] Gomorrah into ashes and condemn them
[1:39:44] with an overthrow making an example unto
[1:39:47] those that should after or after should

[1:40:07] out of Temptations and to reserve the
[1:40:09] unjust until the day of judgment to be
[1:40:11] punished but chiefly them that Walk In
[1:40:14] the Flesh in the lust of uncleanliness
[1:40:15] and despise government presumptuous are
[1:40:18] they self-willed they are not afraid to
[1:40:21] speak evil of dignities a whereas Angels
[1:40:25] which are greater in power and might
[1:40:27] bring not railing accusation against
[1:40:29] them before the Lord but these As
[1:40:32] Natural brute beasts made to be taken
[1:40:34] and destroyed speak evil of things that
[1:40:36] they understand not and shall utterly
[1:40:39] perish in their own corruption and shall

[1:48:08] system aren't you glad that God sent us
[1:48:10] a
[1:48:12] prophet find anyone today any of your
[1:48:15] any of your charismatic preachers any
[1:48:17] anybody today that'll tell you that it
[1:48:21] will be Rome that it is Rome the mother
[1:48:24] church and all of the denominations that

[1:48:37] hour it's going to be Rome that makes a
[1:48:40] covenant with the Jews it's going to be

[1:49:15] understand that that that power set on
[1:49:18] the on the city on uh uh uh
[1:49:23] Seven Hills we understand what the Lord
[1:49:27] prophesied and she was the one that Rome
[1:49:30] Church according to Revelations the 17th
[1:49:33] chapter she's the one that has the that
[1:49:36] that that's that's polluted the whole
[1:49:37] world with her religious
[1:49:39] systems she's the one that taught the
[1:49:42] whole world to to uh uh uh uh commit
[1:49:48] adultery against the word of God in
[1:49:51] other words that God's word is not the
[1:49:56] absolute and and and but we're living in
[1:49:59] the day to where we're not just
[1:50:02] following the word but we're living in
[1:50:04] the day to where the Bride of Jesus
[1:50:07] Christ has been pregnated with that
[1:50:10] word and we don't want any other words
[1:50:15] in the womb of our
[1:50:17] heart we we don't want to take another
[1:50:21] man's words into our
[1:50:24] mind we don't want to take Daddy's
[1:50:26] Mama's brothers sisters
[1:50:30] whoever we we want to make sure that
[1:50:32] we're Vigilant amen and we're guarding
[1:50:35] that heart just as a a woman's got to
[1:50:38] make sure that she's she's true to her
[1:50:40] husband and a man's got to make sure
[1:50:42] he's true to his wife so does his bride
[1:50:45] has to make sure you say well I don't
[1:50:47] believe in legalism you better be
[1:50:49] legalistic about
[1:50:51] it what what if a man were to say well I
[1:50:53] believe it's okay to look at other women
[1:50:55] I don't believe in legalism huh your
[1:50:57] wife don't believe
[1:51:00] that there needs to be something that is
[1:51:03] burning in your heart to stay true to
[1:51:06] Jesus
[1:51:08] Christ do we fail yes we fail and that
[1:51:12] we repent we ask God to give us
[1:51:15] Grace amen but our love is to Jesus
[1:51:19] Christ am I making sense here this
[1:51:21] morning
[1:51:23] our love is to Jesus now now
[1:51:28] amen in there there's you know we there
[1:51:32] there used to be the uh uh you know you
[1:51:35] you we used to just have the little
[1:51:37] X-rays and then we had the um uh what's
[1:51:41] what's the next thing up from the
[1:51:43] x-rays there's the cat scan it gives you
[1:51:46] a little bit more clarity then they
[1:51:48] invented
[1:51:49] the the MRI
[1:51:52] and and then I hear there's something
[1:51:54] even even greater than the
[1:51:56] MRI huh there's also the ultrasound and
[1:52:00] and and and so we had we we we had the
[1:52:04] X-ray back in Luther's day and then we
[1:52:07] we we had the the the the the C scan or
[1:52:10] whatever that is and and Cat Scan and
[1:52:13] then then then then you had the Mr God
[1:52:16] has brought it so clearly today for us
[1:52:20] to be able to see and the scripture says
[1:52:22] that what does what does uh Hebrews 4 uh
[1:52:26] what does uh uh s Keys um Hebrews 4 12
[1:52:30] maybe the word of God is
[1:52:33] sharper and uh uh is quick and powerful
[1:52:36] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:52:39] piercing to the dividing aunder of the
[1:52:40] Soul and Spirit and the joints of the
[1:52:42] maral is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:52:45] the intents of the heart and the
[1:52:47] scripture says we are naked before him
[1:52:50] is that on the next scripture or is that
[1:52:52] up above it amen there is neither is
[1:52:54] there any NE uh any creature that is not
[1:52:57] manifest in his sight for all things are
[1:52:58] naked and open into the eyes of him with
[1:53:01] whom we have to
[1:53:02] do but the word of God gives us the
[1:53:05] clarity so that we can can can walk with
[1:53:10] him amen now there's a lot of there's a
[1:53:13] lot of nonsense in the
[1:53:15] world and in
[1:53:18] and I I don't feel like I don't feel
[1:53:21] like I'm a good enough preacher to to to
[1:53:23] to to to be up here half the time but I
[1:53:26] do want you to understand the F the the
[1:53:28] urgency of what I'm talking about right
[1:53:30] now if there is an Israel that is facing
[1:53:34] a natural Israel that is facing for her
[1:53:38] life battling for her life you had
[1:53:41] better open up your spiritual eyes cuz
[1:53:44] if they're trying to kill the natural
[1:53:46] Israel what are those demons trying to
[1:53:48] do to you spiritual Israel
[1:53:53] and they'll come and I I'm telling you
[1:53:56] I'm telling you he'll hit sickness like
[1:53:58] even in our little congregation just bam
[1:54:00] just just just hit us all just every
[1:54:03] which direction with sickness what is he
[1:54:05] trying to do get us away from
[1:54:09] Faith get us away from it we think well
[1:54:12] we've prayed we've anointed I don't amen
[1:54:15] but we forget the scriptures where we're
[1:54:18] in a
[1:54:20] Warfare and you've got to fight f for
[1:54:22] every one of those
[1:54:24] promises and that takes Gap that takes
[1:54:27] someone with determination that takes
[1:54:29] someone that says hey I know what's
[1:54:31] going
[1:54:32] on I'm going to fight this devil this
[1:54:35] ain't just something that's just
[1:54:37] happening to my gut or happening to my
[1:54:39] head or happening to my you know my
[1:54:41] shoulder or happening to my kid or
[1:54:43] happening to my wife no this is a
[1:54:50] Dev and he's after your faith and he's
[1:54:54] just and he wants to he wants to try to
[1:54:57] just seow some kind of seeds of unbelief
[1:54:59] but we are not a part of the bottomless
[1:55:02] pit there might be smoke coming out of
[1:55:05] that religion without foundation and we
[1:55:08] are affected by it we are affected by it
[1:55:11] amen the reason listen the reason why
[1:55:14] our kids are are are having to be raised
[1:55:17] in a generation to where other kids
[1:55:20] don't know if they're boys and or a girl
[1:55:22] and they don't know which way they're
[1:55:24] right as the reason is is we're living
[1:55:26] in this world but we're not of this
[1:55:28] world this world is under
[1:55:33] judgment you say that's what what do you
[1:55:36] mean judgment the Bible says he turn he
[1:55:39] will turn them over to a repeate mind in
[1:55:43] other words he will sear their
[1:55:45] conscience Amen to where reprobate mind
[1:55:49] they will think they're doing God a
[1:55:52] service they will think that they are
[1:55:55] literally right those guys feel they are
[1:56:00] right that's part of the plague that's
[1:56:03] part of what God has done because they
[1:56:05] receive not the love for the truth God
[1:56:08] gave them over to believe a lie and be
[1:56:11] damned by
[1:56:13] it that's the world we're living in but
[1:56:16] that's not
[1:56:20] you it's not who you are
[1:56:24] keep your garments
[1:56:26] clean can you say
[1:56:28] amen
[1:56:30] amen and that's going to take
[1:56:33] humility that's going to take a
[1:56:34] willingness to say
[1:56:36] hey messed
[1:56:38] up forgive me honey and then go to God
[1:56:42] and say God forgive me a well can you
[1:56:45] say
[1:56:45] Amen children have to go to Mama and
[1:56:48] daddies and say hey I'm
[1:56:49] sorry I'm sorry and then go to God and
[1:56:53] say hey I'm sorry you say what you have
[1:56:55] to do it just like that I'll just go to
[1:56:56] God I don't have to go to Mom and Dad no
[1:56:58] no no the Bible says leave your gift at
[1:57:00] the altar go make go make it right with
[1:57:03] the person that you have wronged and
[1:57:05] then come back and bring your lamb back
[1:57:07] to the altar so so what is he saying
[1:57:10] amen you've got to go get right what
[1:57:13] whoever you've done wrong you've got to
[1:57:15] make that right then come to the altar
[1:57:17] of God and say forgive me we're not
[1:57:20] going to hide anything humil
[1:57:22] says hey it's all right to go to Mom and
[1:57:25] say you know what I've been a doofus
[1:57:27] sorry and it's okay for momas to look at
[1:57:30] their sons and their daughters and say
[1:57:32] hey I got it wrong
[1:57:37] sorry but ultimately we want the blood
[1:57:39] of Jesus Christ we want and we want to
[1:57:43] stay beneath that stay behind that

[1:58:43] God's and and and and and those that
[1:58:45] have come from a such a rugged life amen
[1:58:48] had you to stand up and give a testimony
[1:58:49] it would probably take us two hours of
[1:58:51] what God has done for your life but you
[1:58:53] come to Jesus Christ you've accepted the
[1:58:55] blood of Jesus and God has changed you

[1:59:23] the Bible says there's no sin in heaven
[1:59:25] then let me be free the blood of that
[1:59:28] brother that comes from a solid
[1:59:29] foundation that is found in the Bible
[1:59:32] that is something that is real and
[1:59:34] genuine and you can Bank on it you can't

[2:00:52] written 2,000 years ago and do they
[2:00:55] apply today do you see how accurate and
[2:00:58] how real these scriptures
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:05] are here here's the thing the Bible
[2:01:08] says when you think about it now the
[2:01:10] Beast we understand that the Beast was
[2:01:12] that I mean you
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:18] it's it's that denominational church I
[2:01:21] mean we've gone through that over and
[2:01:22] over the Bible just puts it very
[2:01:26] plainly but if but if you look
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:33] there at the at the 13th
[2:01:36] chapter and and and how that that he's
[2:01:40] going to make war against the the Saints
[2:01:43] and we I mean the Bible just tells us
[2:01:45] that one of the heads were wounded it
[2:01:47] was the Roman Empire we understand
[2:01:48] that's the fourth Empire that's where
[2:01:50] we're at and then amen out of that comes
[2:01:53] uh one of the deadly heads were were
[2:01:56] were revived and come back Rome came
[2:01:59] back as spiritual Rome Papa
[2:02:02] Rome and he is just and and and and it
[2:02:06] says I uh there in 13 and three
[2:02:08] Revelations I saw one of his heads as it
[2:02:10] were wounded to death deadly womb was
[2:02:13] healed and all the world wandered after
[2:02:15] the Beast they worshiped the dragon that
[2:02:17] gave the power unto the Beast they
[2:02:20] worshiped the Beast saying who is like
[2:02:21] an the Beast who is able to make war
[2:02:23] with him and there was given unto him a
[2:02:25] mouth speaking great things and
[2:02:26] blasphemies and power was given un him
[2:02:29] and and he opened his mouth and
[2:02:31] blasphemy against God blaspheme his name
[2:02:33] his Tabernacle and them that dwell upon
[2:02:35] the Earth to make war with the
[2:02:38] Saints to overcome them and the power
[2:02:41] was given to him and and it says all
[2:02:44] that dwell the eth verse all that dwell
[2:02:45] upon the Earth shall worship Him whose
[2:02:47] names are not
[2:02:49] written in the Book of Life the lamb
[2:02:52] slain from the foundation of the
[2:02:57] world lots of scriptures to point to and
[2:03:04] to we've gone through that many a time
[2:03:06] so I've used use a lot of just skimming
[2:03:08] over a lot of things

[2:03:13] today but make
[2:03:18] war how Satan would do that how Satan
[2:03:21] would

[2:03:26] Muslims so the Muslims are
[2:03:29] man they're making
[2:03:33] war and
[2:03:35] yes I
[2:03:37] understand but those same those same
[2:03:39] Devils that were released out of the
[2:03:42] Euphrates
[2:03:45] River it come under that Roman Empire
[2:03:48] that has come in to try to destroy the
[2:03:50] Jews and it's power Rome today that
