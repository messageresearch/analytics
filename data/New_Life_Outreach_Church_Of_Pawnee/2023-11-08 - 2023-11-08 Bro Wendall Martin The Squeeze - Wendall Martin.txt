Book of Revelations the 19th Chapter and the sixth verse we really wanted to hear from Brother Joel tonight and um you know he sort of snuck in on us and uh I I tried twisting his arm to minister this evening and um uh he he's on his way to uh Arizona uh for a meeting over there and so we want to be praying for brother Joel and and sister Virginia as they are uh going as they'll be on the road and and uh uh going to be visiting some friends and attending a meeting there and so we appreciate brother Joel and his whole family what a wonderful preacher he is and and um we we sure love their family amen let's look here in in Revelations the 19th Chapter and the sixth verse and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters as The Voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in the fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb now we're also going to look here in Revelations the 6th chapter and the 9th verse amen so the righteousness of the Saints is the fine linen and the bride has made herself ready now we're going to look at another at a at another woman amen this is in uh Revelations the 6th chapter CH and the nth verse and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet a little while or for a season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your for your blessings thank you Lord for all that you have done for us Lord thank you for this hour and Lord this hour of rapture that is upon us Lord the cogs of God's prophetic will has ground to this moment oh Father we're resting in that I'm asking Lord that you would help us tonight that you would give us strength Lord that you would cause our minds and our our Spirits Lord to be upon you and I'm asking that you would speak Lord I yield myself to you Lord and give my voice my thought thoughts everything I am to you tonight Bless the people Lift us all up into your presence Lord and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight amen like to say that we're just um amen so uh blessed to see brother Josh and sister Laur beta uh back home as they have uh been out ministering and um and uh preaching I think my goodness I think they've been gone for six six weeks I I believe it was and um so uh the the the kids have have grown up so much since we have seen them and and uh uh so we're glad to have them back with us here tonight back home you know I want to minister here tonight on on title it the squeeze and um uh we have just read of the bride and we have just read an account of the Jews and both of them uh will be where one was given the equipment to be made ready and um and then one will be given uh robes amen later on as we have as we look at where we are and I we we've talked a little bit we uh we all know what has been going on there in in Israel and and the persecution and uh that uh just just the the nonsense um the satanic thing that has taken place to them back on the 7th of last month and we uh and then we can see hear all of the rhetoric around the world of of the um amen the anosmatic uh uh stuff that is going the hatred that is going against the Jew and and it and it brought brought some things back to my mind and I I want to deal tonight on The Squeeze I I I um maybe this is a will be a sort of a weird message but this is Wednesday night you don't expect too much on Wednesday nights anyways and uh uh but you are I I want us to look at this because there has been those who have said that the bride will go through a squeeze which will be a persecution and and I want to just go through some things here and maybe amen uh uh show you that there is a squeeze for the bride and there is a squeeze for the Jew but it is not the same squeeze there's a persecution that is going to take place a a natural persecution that'll take place for Israel amen and this is something that they have endured for the last 2,000 years but it took a prophetic Ministry U a Joshua Ministry if you will who who was able to take the word and to divide each their portion and and and there is a portion to the bride and there is a portion to the Jew and then there's a portion or the 144,000 and there's also a portion to the church and so while some are looking for a physical persecution of the Bride I I don't feel that that as a student of the message amen that that is accurate I I I understand that there were statements that were made but I want us to really look tonight at this persecution because I I believe there's an error in in believing that we're waiting for the persecution before the bride comes into a a powerful Ministry I think there is a there is a great error in that I believe that is this is something that will amen that you you you are you are putting something off for the future that is to be taking place right now we're not waiting for the ministry of the Bride the bride is in her ministry right now and we should be expecting a powerful Church even now as we amen as as we are living in this age can you say amen amen and so amen uh if if you will uh just follow brother brandom amen uh a little bit after the after the Feast of the trumpets amen I think that's when a big Corner was turned uh uh for brother brandham because up to this point brother brandom was looking to take the uh uh uh uh eight nights and he was going to preach the Seven Seals or the seven Trumpets like he was uh preaching the Seven Seals and then he found that he he couldn't get the building and everything that they done he says he and Billy and and a few others were working hard trying to get it all put together and and it just never would work and when brother brandham amen uh uh just just went to the Lord and asking the Lord the Lord appeared under brother brandham and says you've already preached this it's under that fifth and sixth seal amen it's already been preached it has nothing to do with the church this has to do with the Jews and so then in the as as brother Bram begin to minister amen uh he he he begin to really bring some of these these nuggets out and to make it a little more clearer or not a little more clearer but a whole lot more clearer amen now brother bradam had made statements such as amen um uh there he says uh he says we had him coming last night with a great sword to kill and we found out that he gets killed with a sword too and the sword of the word he says God's word sharp two-edge sword slays him puts him right down wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice and cut and they'll close the heavens they can shut this and and do that what whatever they want to he'll be slayed by the word that proceeds uh proceeds through his mouth it's sharper than a two-edged sword they could call for a 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to amen it's whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God amen amen and so there there have been many and and and I was one of them amen in my early years that took that that word of God and or took that word from the prophet and misquoted that that quote right there saying we are looking for the bride's Revival it's going to come it's going to come at the at the time I was ignorant amen I didn't I thought the Thunders I had been taught by uh some of those Brothers in the Thunder Group that the Thunders had not been open yet and that we were looking for the seven Thunders to be to be revealed but then we find out amen that that that brother bradam specifically said when they were asked are we still waiting for the Thunders to be revealed he says no that's what the seven seals were all about they were the Hidden Mysteries contained in the seals amen so we find out amen now it's not a future event but it's a right now event as far as the Thunders are concerned but then later on brother brandham in 64 was asked amen he he was asking he says will the bride uh before Jesus comes will she have the power of the Holy Ghost to perform Miracles and raise dead and so on as in the latter rain or is this latter Reign for the 40 144,000 Jews will all ministers have this or are we just waiting for the coming and he said yes he said now I'm not a theologian I I I'm therefore I have to teach all that I know about the Bible from types and shadows he says you can kind of call me a a typologist but if I can look at the wall and I've and I've never seen myself and I look and I can see uh that I got ahead ears and hands I know something about what I'm going to look like after I see myself if I can see the reflection in a mirror I know what I would look like if if I could stand off and look at myself he says and that's the way I think it is of the Bible all of these things Romans 26 said happens for our examples and we can look back and see what it was like the moon reflecting the sun we know what the sun will be uh if if we ever see the sun then we can see the moon and see that it's going to be greater than that well he says he says when you see what happened in the Old Testament it's a reflection of what happens in the new he says now notice Abraham now as he dealt with Abraham so has he dealt with his seed now he's still talking about the power he's still he's still answering their question he says let's go back in the Old Testament let's see what they have to say about it he says now he says uh uh one of these days when I come back sometime I want to take a little uh uh um take that a little closer and show you exactly the Stations of Abraham's life he says it's exactly with Luther and Wesley and on down to here just exactly as he dealt with the churches like he did with Abraham and how he appeared and and how that when he confirmed the Covenant to him under the the the shed blood it was Philadelphian age yes sir that was that was the blood age and he says Luther and the wesleyian age and then we watched the Pentecostal age he says he says he he come up here and made the promise of el Shai nurse for me the question is can you nurse he says what was brought before the Pentecostal sea can you nurse but they didn't do it they grabbed a breast of the denomination where they came out of but then the seed the real seed came on to of that breast of God and and what was the last sign they had before the promised son they waited on all these years he come back what was uh it says it was God standing in the form of a man could discern the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart he says and Sarah being the church representing the church discern the thoughts that is in the church that was even left behind him I know this is a lot of reading right now but I just want to read this read this to you before we get started he says and immediately after that she was changed back to a young woman and him a young man and Isaac was brought on the scene the promised son he says I believe you're seeing the last thing that'll happen to the church before the Rapture the Reign is over you just just read the the first three chapters of Revelations and you'll see what's happened to the church that's that's what's promised the church right there the church ages you know noticed the other day when we started them trumpets and the Holy Spirit says that don't belong here he says uh the latter Reign 144 Jews thousand Jews says it says U Elijah and Moses there's where the Miracles take place the things that the people's been looking for the Pentecostals for miracles and that's where that'll take place see the Elijah and Moses they Smite the Earth with the curses as they uh as often as they will and they close the heavens that it don't rain in the days of their prophecy and they stand and fight for them like he did he'll bring them out under a mighty hand just as he did in Egypt he says our portion we're just waiting on the coming of the Lord so we're not looking for a future Revival somebody says no future Revival we are the Revival we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we're his body we're not looking for hallelujah we're not looking for another man to bring Revival we're not looking for somebody to interpret the Thunders we're not looking for another we're not looking for an Elisha we are we are the Elisha we are the ones that the prophet came to to equip us and set us in order with authority and power of His word well can you say amen amen now and and and they they asking again and uh you know and and uh about the Jews being saved and the brides being saved and and brother brandham says that's a good question he says the first thing the first place the confusion is is what I said about the Gentile days be done when the tri in the tribulation he says now the Gentile bride not the Gentile church now the Gentile church will go through the tribulation period but see the bride is the elected they go through nothing but the Rapture they're just changed and taken out of the world he says now he says uh the Jews that's left is the ones who will be preached to by the two prophets Moses and Elijah amen another place on on uh the uh physical persecution uh they asked in 64 brother Brandon will the bride go through persecution as the early Apostolic Church did he says no I just explained it a few few minutes ago the next thing is the rapture now remember we are at the promised Landen he says you understand the march of Israel amen so uh there here was another and he says he says now if I'm standing in line to get into the church is if standing in line that's another question uh is will only be a memory what is it going to be uh if we are not going through the tribulation are we to be is there some suffering he says the the the question is probably this I'm trying to hurry and I ought not to do this I ought to be laying these things back uh uh because there's there's a there's a place you could stay on it for an hour and just tear it down he says but he says look the people are wanting to to say thinking that the church is going to hit tribulation it won't it can't because because it's redeemed the church the nominal Believers like lot he's going to go through tribulation period and be saved as if it were by fire Noah went through the tribulation carried above it come out with ham and polluted the Earth again lot came out with his own daughters and slept with him but Abraham brought forth the Royal seed brought forth the seed of the promise Enoch went to glory in the Rapture and just took a walk and went home he never went through the tribulation period now there you are he says it does not the Bible cannot buy a type the types can't fail it does not predict the bride now the church will now the people say well what about the early Saints what was that that was the changing of dispensations that was under a persecution which if you were here to hear the church ages and to see how they went out into the darkness and and had to do that then that that shows that they had to take that persecution because each one of the church ages everything begin to show that they went darker and darker until finally it went completely uh denied his name and picked up another name that they live but he says but then come to the time of the calling out of the Bride which was to escape all damnation it is counted worthy to excape this damn nation and wrath that's to come upon the Earth that you might be counted worthy to escape it not go through it but Escape it Hallelujah he says now do you understand that he says the church the lukewarm anything outside the elect will go through that tribulation period they will not raise in the first resurrection so where should our attention be tonight are we looking for a persecution yes there is is a persecution yes there is a squeeze but it's not a physical persecution we're looking for it is the econom e e ecumenical uh Church devil that will try to take the life of God out of your life amen he'll try to come in and take that life where what has he done to the bride tree in the past amen he come in and he took the leaves and then he then then he got to the bark and God on what was he doing he was trying to get to the life of the tree Restoration in this evening time has restored the life back to us and we've got to be stand guard and fight that spiritual warfare Hallelujah sometimes we want to phys it be easier for us Amen to just give our lives I I you know sometimes I think that amen it would just be easier sometimes for for you know but but but you see somebody's got to stand up and fight for the life of God in the church somebody's got to stand up and fight for the life of God in the individual amen somebody's got to stand and keep malice out and keep bitterness out but and keep joy in let the life of the Holy Spirit live in the church can you say Amen amen there is that spirit that formal spirit that has tried his best to take the life of God out of our churches I'm not talking about I'm not talking about the nominal L the C I'm talking about the bride's church I'm talking about this bride amen Satan wants to take the life of God out of your life out of your church out of your praise out of your Bible study he wants to take the life of God Amen so where should our attention be when the bridegroom came the foolish did not have life they did not have oil can you say amen amen now we know how Satan invaded the church amen the insect poison the tree making it dead and formal with Creeds and dogmas until the Holy Spirit can't move and amen the preacher injecting his own ideas of the word into the people amen giving his own opinions and and and trying to explain away what brother brandham said and taking things out and before you know it brother you are taking the life of God from the people amen the Holy Ghost can't move in a church if there ain't a pure word the Holy Ghost can't move in your life unless there's a pure word the Holy Ghost can't move in your family unless there's a pure word but the pure word had to come back because that's the only thing that the Holy Spirit can dwell in is the word can you say amen amen the life of God cannot stay when man as tempered with that word amen now thinking of the you know Hamas and you know and how that you know the the the leaders are billionaires and and and here amen they've been leading the the you know uh uh Palestine what's what's the country huh Hallelujah Gaza Gaza thanks amen Hal Hallelujah and and so Gaza you know I I don't know how they've elected them over and over and over is probably a rigged election but here they built their they've built all of their stuff right in the middle of their schools and their playgrounds and and their hospitals and I mean they're shooting bombs right outside of hospital they they are plugging their stuff inside the hospital inside the the mosques inside of all of these things I mean it's it's proven they've got pictures of it they're showing it it's amen this is this is really happening Israel's not making this up now Gaza amen as some of the poorest people and they're blaming all Israel for that amen and and here their leaders are leave are living in lavish life uh Lifestyles they're they're living in wealth and amen and and and and and I'm just why what I'm trying to say is why would anybody allow the enemy to have that kind of power over their lives amen amen hallelujah now it's easy for us to say but there's a lot of church people that's allowing the Devil Amen to build his Tunnel right underneath the church he's he's operating his junk right there in your in your presence and we allow it they have shown that inside these houses are tunnels amen they they they shown the entire an an entire residential areas where there are tunnel amen we where H A shafts where it's coming up inside these homes these are these are terrorists that are allowed to operate amen yeah they're going to get killed if they stand up against him yeah amen they this and that and the other and so they decide that they're just going to live peace y amen but and let these terrorists run their lives but I want to tell you tonight ien God's children are not going to knuckle down to any kind of a terrorist we're not going to knuckle down to any kind of an enemy amen if you say that you're a preacher then you show that you've got my best interest if you say that you love me amen then you point me to Calvary and the word and the message of the Prophet sir don't be living on my amen my ties as I'm paying you to Amen to live in luxury and you're leading my soul astray and you're taking the power from me I want to tell you it's time for us to stand up and say I want to live free amen amen enough for joining this camp and that camp and this and what this one will say and what that one will say why don't we stand up and say I believe God because if you get numb to it and you embrace it and you allow the Creeds to be set up in your mind you'll sacrifice the very life and power of God and if the power ever leaves your soul there's nothing left but religious forms of godliness there's nothing left but Church attendance with no life there's nothing left but Bible studies with no power there's nothing left with prayer meetings with no passion amen there's nothing left but a a a mediocre lifestyle The Squeeze is not a persecution to come the squeeze is the demon that is tripping the life of God from from us amen well praise the Lord now it's the power of Christ that places the church can you say Amen at the opening of the seals when the seals were released it released you it showed you who you were it exposed Satan's kingdom can you say amen amen and what did it do the supernatural spirit of God the Holy Ghost was released at the preaching or the opening of the word amen it that was once Shut Out by dogmas that was once Shut Out by by Creeds that was once Shut Out by opinions but now the word has came back you think I'm ever going to go back and allow that Old Devil to sit there in his dungeon underneath my house anymore no sir God's given me his power his word and I'm not going to let it Goen when the Holy Spirit is free to move and to live God's body his church is lives in Liberty can you say Amen so God's bride is not looking for a National Force to put her into the power of God brother brandom says like Israel back in the promis plan she don't know how she got back there but she was just automatically put back there why the National Force put her in her place now I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world faces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she will recognize her position in the word and then she's in Christ and will put her in her place no National Force will do that no na but National Force will drive Israel to the Homeland National forces of the Council of church will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it he says all people recognize your day as Jesus warned you the sign of Sodom the church sets conditionally in this day he says look what he said in this day would take place listen to it real close now the sign of Sodom would take place in the day the sign like Abraham that day before Sodom or uh uh uh before Sodom was called out all these things was prophesied will be taking place now can I hear an amen now it's the power of God that'll raise her up recognize we're not looking for something in the future recognize the authority you have now recognize brother if there's a time for the Holy Ghost to be in the church it is now not later now [Applause] if for prayer meetings are are a little amen lack a daisy then we need to ask God to bring back the power amen if the word isn't as is isn't as Rich to us as it once was it's not because you've heard the sermons amen time after time it's because you have gotten numb to what God is doing you've got to recognize what God has done it's your path power not lifting up a prophet not exalting a man it's your power to a Rapture can you say Amen now brother B says the power of God Rises her up Hallelujah the fourth seal am man when the church goes up Satan comes down someone says when the church goes up Satan comes down so the church has got to go up now we know that that's a compound meeting amen there're in Revelations the 4th chapter and it says and there was a door that was opened up to me in the heavens and there was a call that said amen uh uh uh uh come up hither and I will show you things which must come to pass Hereafter amen that scripture is a compound meaning there has to first of all be a spiritual rising up that's what the that's what the rapt rapure is it's a catching up and the Rapture is a catching up of our soul it's a rising up to the conditions that God's called you to into the Heavenly places it's those heavenly places that'll take you hallelujah it's the position of the Bride that gives you that Authority can you say amen amen now I I want you to catch that he says now amen you say uh brother Wendell if that's the case then why do we have all of these other persecutions brother Wendell if what you're saying is right then why is the Chinese some of our Chinese Brothers in prison and they're tortured why do we have a lot of people dying for their faith around the world Amen the persecution of the church has been here for the last 2,000 years amen there's a difference in the persecution of the Jew and the persecution of the Bride Hallelujah now there's always been and there always will be persecutions for the bride and this is not just in the Physical Realm this is also in the spiritual amen we've been beat and killed and imprisoned for the word's sake amen my brother Bram says a casual study into the history of the church will show us amen from the even from the days of Pentecost all the way down to where we are that Satan has always been there to fight the church can you say Amen people have given their lives people are giving their lives in prisons and the elect have been killed for the for the gospel sake in in as I say in China in the Muslim countries and amen around the world but there's no prophecy of a worldwide person persecution against the Bride of Jesus Christ before the Rapture there's no prophecy there is there are y'all hearing me there there is no wholesale persecution that is coming to the church except for the spirits of dogmas and brother Brandon went through all of this in the in in the Feast of the trumpets amen the church and the 144,000 they get the persecution the bride is dealing with those Church Devils that wants to take the life of God from you hallelujah hallelujah can you say Amen now the Feast of the trumpets were strictly for the Jews not the bride and it will be the persecution of the Jews that will that that actually brought the Jews back to their their Homeland it was the persecution of Hitler and Stalin and and these other men that brought the Jews back to their Homeland it made them desperate they didn't want to go back to that old that old Hallelujah that old nasty country of Israel that little Barren desert they they they were happy where they were but God gave them a promise can you say amen amen so Hitler Rose and amen and and and and and you know and there were millions of Jews that were killed Hallelujah and and what did it do it created a desperation to go back home amen it created a des well praise the Lord amen now we know that there's got to be a Moses and Elijah that is going to preach the same message the same gospel the same Jesus the same blood Covenant that you have to the Jews and they will receive the same holy ghost that you received well praise the Lord but it can only happen as a nation in Israel praise the Lord amen and so the persecution of the Jews is not even similar to the bride's trials amen the Jews are under judgment well praise the lord they're they're still under they're under judgment what what did they say when the Jews rejected and crucified their Messiah and they scream crucify him there in Matthew 27 and 24 and pilate saw that he couldn't Prevail nothing but rather a tumult was made and he he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I'm innocent of the blood of this just man uh just person see ye to it and then answered all the people all the people and said his blood be on us and our children that was the worst thing they could ever say they rejected their Messiah they rejected amen and it wasn't a few years later when Titus came in and and and and blood literally ran out the temple amen literally ran out into the road there was such a Slaughter of Jews back in Titus because they rejected God's Messiah they rejected are y'all hearing me they were under and they they were under judgment and were dispersed to every nation under the under the heavens Israel went for 2,000 years not a nation the Jews went with no Nation for 2,000 years oh praise the Lord praise the Lord but God says I've given a promise unto Abraham I've given a promise that thy seed shall possess and shall inherit well praise the Lord can you say amen amen but you see we we understand through through the Apostle Paul's writings amen he there there in Romans 11 and 8 it shows that God was the one that blinded their eyes to his presence if you look there in Romans 11:8 it says according as the written God ha given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear un this day and David had said uh uh let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they might not see and bow down their back hallways can you say Amen now the Catholic Church says see the they're the enemy of God but then you go to the 11th verse and it says I say then have they stumbled that they should fall God forbid but rather through their fall salvation is coming to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them The Riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness so now the Apostle Paul is letting us know they were blinded because you and I his bride had to accept that atonement well praise the Lord God blinded their eyes so that you and I could receive pardon and mercy as the Gentiles well praise the Lord amen hallelujah the stuff they're going through over there in Israel right now this is all part of Prophecy you know what God you know right Hallelujah I I someone told me I I I have not I have not confirmed this but someone told me that Jerusalem or Tel Aviv or Jerusalem is the homosexual capital of the world Israel is that that nation of Israel is so perverse and so ungodly it's so filthy now they they are they they have got amen they they they they've got money and and and and they they uh uh uh they're you know uh uh and some of their some of their goods that they sell amen they they're the number one in the world uh uh to to export these things but you see God is turning back to the Jew and just because they're in their uh Israelites and just because they're Jews don't mean they're really Jews he says it's not a Jew outwardly it's the Jew inwardly can you say Amen God's got 144,000 that has got to hear the gospel can you say Amen when you see this stuff going on over there in Israel and it's Not Just Another War folks This Is Not Just Another War this is not just Hamas and Israel this has been going on for years look at these demons all over the world hating the Jew it's that same devil well praise the Lord Brother brandom says now amen if if you I believe it's there in in Romans the 8th or or Revelations the 8th chapter about the four about the about the angels from the four corners of the earth and they and they were holding back the Four Winds until the 14 4,000 were sealed away they would have it would have been over a long time ago if it hadn't been for that they would have been wiped off but it was God that held those demons back it's God hallelujah those same demons that was in that that was in those men that killed the millions of Jews back then is the same demons that want to destroy Israel today Hallelujah and God's going to use those Devils Amen to bring them home and you know what it's going to do it's going to create a hunger it's going to cause a desire it's going to cause something on the inside calling out to their God for deliverance Romans 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you be wise in your own conceits blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in now this is where I want you to look Hallelujah when you see what is taking place remember remember there's going to be an atonement now what what I'm getting ahead of myself let me let me just let me just go on here that blindness and part has come until the fullness of the Gentiles come in so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant un them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake can you say amen amen today Israel is a nation because amen is a nation because God had a promise for them they were driven out of the land they were ceased to be a nation they were scattered among every nation under the heaven dozen of scriptures has promised that she would be gathered back again in her Homeland just one of them here Isaiah 11 and 12 and he shall set up an ins sign for the Nations and shall assembled the outcast of Israel and gathered together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth 1948 the nation Israel become a na again God kept his promise can you say amen God has to deal with Israel by force why she's unregenerate she's not following the leadership of God she's she's not born again well praise the Lord God don't have have to deal with the bride in the same way that he has to deal with Israel the bride knows his voice follows his voice trials are out there tribulations are out there but we got doesn't have to use force on you my sheep hear my voice and they follow can you say Amen Israel must somebody say Israel must and Israel will accept God's provided way but until then amen she's under judgment in the penalty of sin and she'll have to be washed in the blood of God's provided lamb can you say amen amen from 1933 into 1945 the Holocaust brought about a forcing millions of Jews were tortured and slaughtered and gas Chambers and and and and all of that filth it it it was it was such it makes your stomach to turn amen but God had already given him a promise I can only bless you when you're in your land I can only bless you when you're in your land I I'm not going to bless you when you're in America I can't bless you whenever you're my Covenant is still with you but I can only BL I am going to read there's there's scriptures concerning you Israel there's scriptures concerning you amen the Messiah is going to reveal himself to you and you're going to ask him where did you get the scars you're going to ask him and he's going to say in the house of my friends but it's got to be there at Mount oliv it so the pressure moved her back into her Homeland well praise the Lord can you say Amen so where is Jesus going to reveal himself to the 144,000 in their Homeland he can't reveal him himself Hallelujah I love him I love him now now remember amen under the fifth seal the fifth seal is the Jew seal amen though it's not in full swing yet but we understand amen that all of those Jews even from Pentecost all the way back are under that there in there in Revelation 6 and9 and when he had opened that fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now this is not this has nothing to do this is not for the blood of Jesus Christ but they were standing for what they for the word of God that they that they thought that they were that they that they knew and they cried with a loud voice how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth this can't be the bride this ain't the bride because this one's crying out for vengeance brother him says see the bride says father forgive them but this group of people amen is crying out for vengeance are you hearing me now watch he says and then and then the white robes were given unto every one of them and it was told them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren should that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled in other words there's there there's some others that's going to have to give their life amen Amen in this great persecution is that right amen now the seven trumpets sound at that seal of persecution of the Jews now I want us to look just for a minute can I have more a little more time so the Feast of the trumpets now remember we' we've gone through the other the other Feast but the Feast of the trumpets come right after the Pentecostal Feast the the the Feast of Pentecost or the the Feast of Weeks it went for seven sabbaths brother Bram says that we have been in the Feast of Pentecost for the last seven Church ages and when we are caught up then the the trumpets will begin to sound to the Jews and will be pulling her back now what was it if you if you were to go look at the Old Testament Feast of the trumpets amen number one it was a call to to repentance number two it was a call unto God to remember his Covenant with Israel number three it was to th Satan's accusations of Israel before God it was a call of preparation Amen brother Brandon would tell us that those trumpets was to call to prepare telling them to come because the next Feast was going to be the day of atonement so the so the the the the trumpets were to sound and prepare the Jews the persecution was to bring the Jews to a place in their heart to where they can receive the atonement well praise the Lord now we're seeing right what we're seeing right now amen now now in the Old Testament they were to sacrifice the perfect wooly lamb amen and they were to do it with sincerity amen it was a call and when they do it now now now they would have to go through this ritual and they there had to be a time of mourning it was a time of weeping it was a time of repentance before God and then the day of atonement they would walk over to take that lamb that would be killed for them are y'all understanding what I'm saying it's the it's this persecution of the brother bradam says the the the the Feast of the trumpets it's the persecution it's a pulling the the the Jews it's calling them it's getting them alarmed it's waking them up because Christ has got to reveal they've got to receive the Messiah that they crucified they've got to receive the same holy ghost that you and I received God is fixing to reveal himself under her can you say amen amen the precursor now what we're seeing is that precursor of that Sixth Seal amen those Fifth and six seal and those trumpets amen calling those Jews back to their Homeland but more than back to their just a Homeland but to their God Amen preparing their heart for the Lamb of God the atonement that is to come it is a wakeup call Joel amen the second chapter deals with it but I'm just going to read uh the first two verses of Joel 2 and and one it says blow ye the trumpet in Zion sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the Lamb tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is nigh at hand a day of darkness and of gloominess a and a day of clouds and a thick Darkness has the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not been able uh uh been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even the years of many generations and it goes on down it is calling of Israel this is the day of the Lord that's when Moses and Elijah will come and preach the gospel and do the signs the prophetic signs they'll shut up the Heavens amen they'll turn the water into blood they'll they they they'll do those things well can you say Amen Church where are we at when I see all of these these idiots idiot politicians idiot professors these these demon-possessed educated folks that are stirring up the trouble and causing all of this stir against the Jews makes you mad but it also knows that prophecy when we go when we go up Satan comes down and woe to the inhabitants of the Earth come on church I say we're close at hand I say we're close at hand brother Bram says now last Sunday preaching the Feast of of the feast days he says there was the Feast of Pentecost and between the Feast of Pentecost and the Feast of the trumpets was a long period of time exactly 50 days between Pentecost and the Feast of the trumpets and and and the 50 Hallelujah my computer praise the lord it's uh um and the 50 which which Pentecost means 50 is the it was the Sha the sheath waving or the end Gathering the first fruits of the Harvest was brought in and we see that it was back in Tye there with the natural first fruits representing the first fruits of the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon the people and we find out then that them 50 days was received by the Gentiles which God called from the Gentiles the people for his name the Feast of the Pentecost we have been going through that long Feast of Pentecost from 50 days would be actually seven uh exactly seven sabbaths seven sabbaths represent seven Church ages to be called in the time of the Pentecost uh the the Feast of Pentecost to call the people from the Gentiles for his name now at the end of these seven sabbaths which has been there was to be a day of an atonement which was the seven Trump trumpets amen the seven trumpets was to call for a day of mour to call back for the sacrifice or the atonement and we find out then that the seven trumpets pertained only to Israel then why he wouldn't let me preach them seven trumpets I was even ready to announce it had the Halls ready everything uh to go into preach those seven trumpets I said there's something bothering me so bad we kept on working Billy and all of us trying to get everything ready for the air conditioning building for the next week for the seven trumpets having eight days had the had the school auditorium but the Holy Spirit wouldn't let me do it for some reason and I wondered why and when I went into pray I told my wife I'm going in and I sincerely knelt before God and he revealed to me that the seven trumpets sounded under that six seal I've done preached it supernaturally it's the hand of God the whole thing it pertains to Israel we picked it up under that six seal you all who have that how the persecution of the Jews the time of the Gentiles has been in this Pentecostal Feast the trumpets all of them sounded under that sick seal and we and and we picked it up last Sunday under the Feast of the trumpets if you all want to get it to rush the Jews from all parts of the world back to their Homeland it must be the opening of the seals under the Sixth Seal and the Seven trumps sounded in The Sixth Seal and the seventh angel is to open the mystery of the seal was calling the 11th Hour Gentile workers to receive the same pay that that the first hour workers got you know I I I don't know I I I when I I you know coming up to preach I thought first of all this is a Sunday morning message instead of it's more of a teaching amen and and then I and then I got to thought well I probably won't be ready then neither so I'm just going to get up and spit and sputter and and and and just try to tell you what I've got I'm here to tell you what we are seeing today I believe amen is is a is the Fulfillment amen we are we are seeing the Winds of the tribulation we're seeing demons hey we're still here on this Earth and those demons are still acting up what's going to happen when you and I are out of here what's going to happen when God's body here on Earth is gone then Satan will have a you talk about a hatred for the Jews you talk about a can you say amen that's when the Superman's going to come in that's when the Pope's going to come in Hallelujah those those poor old Muslims they think they're going to rule the world and it ain't even them it's going to be the pope you'll only get to do it for an hour but at least he'll say he has the whole world Hallelujah before he's bombed praise the Lord amen but you see the church is not under that kind of a persecution I'm afraid if we waiting for a persecution you might be here in the tribulation I don't want to be waiting for a persecution I want to be looking at those devils and dealing with those Devils right now that are persecuting me trying to hinder my faith and take away the life of God and take away the faith of God try to keep me to disbelieve God's word try to get me to hate my brother try to get me Amen to get LAX and naive come on church amen the seals have been open the seals the spirits have been unveiled we know what we are dealing with they didn't know what they were dealing with back in the early ages you and I know the spirit of the Antichrist and what he has done to try to take the life of God out of the church where are you standing brother Wendell we got to go through persecution there's one thing for certain the bride's already been judged the bride's already been judged through the Messiah that they have accepted and the Jews are going to receive robes white Robes of righteousness when they accept their Messiah oh what a story what a story Hallelujah if you were to finish reading on down there about the Jews the 144,000 as going and these are the servants that serve Minister unto him they are servants they Jud the Israel is the servant

fighting is the Prince of Persia or the Prince of Le oosa who is trying to keep you from receiving what God has done in this day can you say amen amen hallelujah I'll tell you what brother Bram said about you she's ready to strict the final climax to bring forth a faith that'll Rapture the church into Glory she's laying in the persecution that is to come no that's not what he said she's laying in those messages we're really at the end time we've talked about it and everything but the thing has moved upon us now yeah yes sir here is one can you say Amen man what did he say he said now if he was the Messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to the to be the Redeemer and the anointed one and God raised up up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one I wish I could tell it the way I see it I wish I had the education I could I could do with it I hope you see it I hope God the Holy Ghost comes down and puts it into your heart to see what I mean the resurrection we are now in the resurrection we are setting with him in this Resurrection but only those who have life can you say amen amen what do you love him now now the prophet would tell us he would say he said what has it done the cunningness he come in like flatteries and amen he's bringing the Protestant e communic Council of the world churches the spirit of the Antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter like they did the other in the hour to call the bride he says now how he's loosed in the ecclesiastical Church Spirit loosed upon wi not upon the denominations upon the bride now this here is this here is in the Feast of the trumpets he's he's loosed upon what not the denominations but the pride but here you get it the bride will not go through that time the Bible says not the church will but not the bride Can't You See It ministers can't you see that Brethren you say the church

Mrs Jesus Christ oh can you say Amen you always were a son yes you always were a daughter the blood has come to redeem you to empower you not for you to sit around in quote quotes not for us preachers to have a job amen not for us not not no no he wants you to let you know you don't have to knuckle down to those Devils you don't have to knuckle down to any kind of those demons that'll try to keep you down you have authority over all powers you have author we are still living in the Feast of Pentecost it's the power of the Holy Ghost that they had what now now remember brother bradam says now it will be the he says he says the 11th Hour workers in the days just coming up to the Feast of the trumpets God is calling the 11th Hour workers what he's referring to Jesus talks about those who came the first hour was given a penny those who came the fourth hour was given a penny some came in the 11th Hour only had one hour left and they gave him a penny and those that had the first hour that was there all day long said hey I've worked all day long and you're giving them a penny you're giving he says what is it to you you agreed for the penny the same thing they had at Pentecost this last bride this last church will have I'd say there's not a better day to be a laborer in the kingdom of God I there's not a better day preachers I've been preaching at you for the last three or four Services there's not a better day amen to heed to the call of God in our lives amen if God's calling preachers then I say in the name of Jesus Amen power of the Holy Spirit come upon me and let me deliver God's people and preach it with everything that I've got can you say amen amen if the musicians would come praise the Lord amen now God when he made man in the beginning he made him a superior to any thing on the earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on the earth to control everything controlled animal life he controlled the foul life the fishes of the sea he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything man was made as a secondary God on the earth and he was given the power to control all things all the elements of the earth that was Adam Adam was given these great Powers but then the power that he had to make himself is where he fell and but Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they obeyed he could speak to the wildlife it would obey he could speak to the waters every what it was everything obeyed Adam that's the beginning of man that's what God gave him power over everything on the Earth now though he fall he's lost through the fall he's lost the power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after he's losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with a father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through what Adam was in God I want you to listen to me now this is not just another quote now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that Our Redeemer a redeemer anything is to bring it back can you say man he says if we were to just going down for the sake of times one man fell he lost this but what he lost in the fall Christ came as the Redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to the Eternal fellow ship and relationship to God to be sons and daughters again to restore us back to all that Adam lost in the fall the thing of it is since he has restored man back man in in the fall lost his consciousness of what God put him here on the earth to do in other words all of us Plumbing as it were and his brain Outlets his faith has been clogged up with the business Affairs home life domestic things it's all become so clogged up until God can't operate through the channels that he made man for that when God made the human body every little part had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make man to live and if God so patterned the man the body of man how much more has he pattered and set in order the body of Christ the church I'm saying that there is not a weakling church that he's coming for it's going to be a glorious Church devils are fighting but we're not under judgment we're he's very well pleased he's pleased that he's got a woman that trust him loves him believes him on that side he was a Son of God on this side he he was a he was a fallen creature on that side he's an offspring of God he has the inheritance of the earth he can control nature he can speak it into existence he's the Creator himself he's The Offspring of God but when he crossed he separated his sunship he's a sinner by Nature now he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan God took a sacrifice the chemical of the blood but the blood of bulls and goats cannot divorce sin it only covered sin if I've got a red spot on my hand and cover it with white the red spot still there see it's still there but God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his own son that when our confessed sin drops into God's bleach try to find it again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators down through the time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him till the day of judgment what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father father again standing on that side of the chasm with no remembrance sin against him there's no more stain a a bleach can be seen anymore he's free Hallelujah just as the clor rocks or just as that ink can never be ink no more because it's broke up and sent back when confessed sin is confessed and been dipped a man or woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and laid on him till the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into the cast into the Lake of Fire and the chasm is bridged never to come into the remembrance no more a man stands Justified as a Son of God that's what the Messiah done for you Sister Mary that's what the atonement means the Feast of Pentecost came after the Passover you remember there was the blood that was put on the door and the death angel that was killing everybody else had to pass over because the blood was applied no more [Music] s Hallelujah We Stand today under the authority of that atoning blood it was shed for [Music] you the blood because God knew that you were going to be full of mistakes God knew that you were going to
