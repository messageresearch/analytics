closer home now than I've ever been I heard a preacher one time said there was uh maybe a certain uh Cruise liner shipping company or the captain of the ship and the crew he told the story about that they crossed the Atlantic Ocean many times and they had a tradition that when they knew they were at the halfway point that when they started getting closer to their destination that they took out whatever glasses and they gave a toast to each other to say that we're closer to our destination than where we came came from where we started how many's closer this morning [Music] amen you want to take a drink of water or toast whatever it is signifying that I'm closer now home then when I then when I started amen well let's stand to our feet this morning amen how many want to hear about home this morning amen kind of homesit amen for a country amen praise the Lord as the man of God gets ready to come amen wonder if we could just sing this little course amen amen God wants to hear you sing amen an F [Music] amen their chains were fasten tight down at the jail that night still Paul and silus not be dismayed they said it's time to lift our voice sing praises to the Lord let's prove that we will trust him come what may God wants to hear you sing I heard a woman sing this she's already there I believe she's singing this morning and there oh you see God wants to hear your voice when the wisest man has spoken says your circumstance is as hopeless as can be oh that's when God wants to hear you sing he loves to hear your praise on our cheerful days when the pleasant times outweigh the bad by far but when suffering comes Al Al and we still sing Our Song oh that is when we bless the oh want you lift your hands to him and say oh God wants to hear you sing when the waves are crashing around you when the fiery dark around you when despair is all you see God wants to hear your voice when the wisest man has spoken says your circumstance is as hopeless as can [Music] be oh that's when God wants to hear oh let's sing that second verse again he loves to hear our praise on our cheerful days when the pleasant times out way the by far but when suffering comes along and we still sing Our Song that is when we bless the father oh let's bless his name this morning oh God on want to hear you sing when the waves are crashing around you when the fire [Music] you see that's when God [Music]

and um we're just so thankful for his Spirit good to see everyone here today in the house of the Lord and um amen we uh always look forward to to coming uh to worship you know I I just expect God to do something something every time we come God's got something in store for his Believers and um and I believe that here this morning and so uh if there's there's no telling what God can do will do amen when Believers come together praise the Lord if you have your uh Bibles we'll turn to Psalms the 20th chapter or the 19th Chapter and um we will look here at the um 13th verse and um maybe maybe we'll start here at the 12th verse praise the Lord um we um have got to um or I I should say Mom and Dad are are um on the way back they started yesterday day and I ended up having to stop and and rest up for the night but uh so they're they're on their way back home and and so we're we're thankful uh we'll be glad to have them back and um you know we we don't have too very uh very long I think we've got here in a couple of weeks got our um our our fall fellowship and um so we're we're sure looking for that I know the kids enjoy that and hey I think all of all of the kids come out of us in that in that time and so uh we want to uh that's something to look forward to uh want to keep brother Mitch and and his father in prayer and through this time and I know uh it's it's a hard time uh when your when your dad is is feeble and and um so I I just want us to to pray for brother Mitch's dad but also for brother Mitch that the Lord will strengthen him let's look here uh again in uh Psalms 19 and 20 who can understand his errors uh cleanse thou me from Secret faults keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you thank you for your love and and all of your mercies and your blessings upon Our Lives thank you Lord for your spirit that we feel here this morning and we're just asking Lord that that you would come and minister to us as we have ministered to you Lord in our songs and prayers we're asking Lord that you would uh just help us to open our hearts and our minds and and we're asking that your presence Lord would be would be just Among Us and and cause your word to be burned into our heart Lord thank you for your love and your blessings Lord thank you for all that you are to us in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning amen we uh want to minister uh again along the lines of the Overcomer um that we have been uh taking the last um several services and um I would I would like to minister this morning on on serving God with fervency and um amen um having a fervent heart and I think having a a a fervent heart first of all amen uh if you're going to serve the Lord you you want to you want to know that you're serving the right God you want to know that you're serving a living God a god that is that is very much alive that God that keeps his word amen because uh if you you you can't really put your everything into something that you're not too sure of but God keeps his word God has proven over and over that he keeps his word and so we we look here today amen just looking back through the scripture amen and God keeps his word he he he keeps his word in the in the good he keeps his word in the bad amen he keeps he he he'll he'll keep he'll bless you and then he'll keep his word in a in cursing amen if you walk with him he'll bless you if you disobey him he'll whoop you and and and because God keeps his word amen Now Eve found out that amen that God kept his word amen when God told Adam and Eve don't don't partake of the tree and when the of the fruit of that tree and and and when Satan comes in and said well but surely God knows and then amen and and before you know it he got in he he started reasoning with her but it didn't take long for Eve to to to find out that God will keep his word he's going to keep his word amen uh he'll keep his curses he'll keep his blessings he will keep his word amen Noah found out you know as as the only righteous man amen uh on upon the Earth the Bible said it was was Noah one his family and God proved to Noah that obedience and preparation Amen to the word of God pays off God kept his word even though it was science was saying that there's no rain and and and and the history had proven that there was no rain and and and the scoffers were saying there was no rain but yet God gave his word and said there will be rain and I want you to prepare that Ark amen and when he took God's provided way and preparing that Ark when the rain did come then we find that that Noah was safe and Noah was Secure can you say amen amen God proved his way even to to to Enoch we before the flood came before Noah came God of course we understand that that Noah was was a uh was a type of the of the nominal church it was a type of those that are going to go through the tribulation amen and how that uh H uh God will still have a a a um amen a remedy God will still have those that will come through the tribulation amen but God had provided through Enoch amen provided a rap Rapture for him and proved that there would be a Rapture for the Believers today Amen in the days of Sodom amen Abraham found God to be true I say today that God will prove himself to be true if we are willing to walk with god with a fervent heart can you say amen amen there was there was uh when God came down to Abraham and and he told him he said now Sodom is going to burn amen I I I can't tolerate the sin anymore and and so I'm going to come down amen and and and and and I I'm going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah amen now now Abraham had been separated from lot and he had been waiting for a promise amen for for a long time uh close to Amen to 25 years at that time and and a and he was waiting and looking but when God came and told him that Sodom was fixing to burn and God kept his word what did it do to Abraham it began to cause an intensity of faith in his heart that if God will keep his word amen concerning the fire fallen in Sodom then he will keep his word concerning the promise of Isaac to me can you say Amen Lot's wife found God's word to be true amen there she she just couldn't put her whole Trust in God as as as as Lot's wife she her heart wasn't in leaving Sodom amen she she loved her position and she loved her the community there and and and the Bible says that she had to turn around and and to look at what she was leaving behind one more time and and the Bible says that she was turned to a pillar of salt amen so God proves his word word to be truth I I I say today that there should be a fervency between you and God if God has proven his word to be true over and over and over then there should be a fervency in the heart of the Believers that Lord I'm going to H H uh uh cling to your word and believe your word because I know you are faithful I think there's too much laxness today amen too much sugarcoated preaching there's too much lukewarm members that that doesn't have the stir of God and the reason for this is they're not thinking upon what God has done what God is doing amen and and the Fulfillment of Prophecy that is taking place right now but I want to tell you there's a lot of Prophecy taking place right now there there's a lot going on in the world today they are getting ready this Earth is getting ready to be burned and as and as Abraham could set there and see the prophecy coming to pass then he can have a hope in his heart to say that I know that my promise is coming to pass too amen that's right Joseph found that God will always prove his word to be true though he went through hell and high water though amen he he he had jealous brothers and amen that that you know and they they stripped him of his coat of many colors but he found out that though they stripped the coat of many colors that the could not strip away the promise amen though he was sold and in prison God kept his word to Joseph and exalted him to Pharaoh's right hand just exactly the way God said he would do it his brothers came and and and and and bowed before him God kept his word can I hear an amen amen God keep his word god kept his a his word to Abraham when he says that you're land you that that you're seed is going to go down amen into into Egypt and amen and and and they're going to be sojourners for 400 years and amen and when the time had come the wicked Pharaoh uh H was killing all of the the children that were two years and under he was anointed of the devil to kill all of those babies two years old and younger amen they would throw him out into the Nile River and and and and the crocodiles would eat them and amen but you see while this was going on God had given a promise of a deliverer and there the the the the deliverer Moses was born now Moses amen was God's predestinated seed he was God's predestinated deliverer and Moses mother looked at that child and said I know that this is the one that God has ordained for this season amen and though everyone is dying amen and then baby's dying and that baby's being killed I believe God has got my child and he's going to you know what I think that we can have that same kind of assurance this morning that our children if God gives us children these are special children amen and they're not they're not going to be destroyed Amen in the in the sins of Leota so what did Moses mother do amen she built a little a little Ark out of bull rushes and then she amen she pitched it with slime a a and she pushed her little baby put it down in it amen and then and then pushed it out into uh the Nile River where the crocodiles were and amen where they had been feeding upon the babies and you know what the Bible said happened amen when that B that that little Ark floated down the river amen God sent that boy right to Pharaoh the cruel-hearted pharaoh's daughter amen and she rescued the child and Pharaoh raised Moses right there in his own Palace God sent Moses the great deliverer amen right to the Palace of of pharaoh was raised him up and then here come amen God's deliverer and and and took uh Israel back to their Homeland God kept his word can I hear a great big amen God kept his word Passover amen when Moses cried out the night before they were to be delivered in Exodus amen and he and he cried out and said the the the death angel is going to is is going to come by tonight amen and I want you to go and and and and and kill a lamb and I I want you to take the blood of that lamb and I want you to put it upon the on the doorpost and upon the l i i i want you to be prepared and I want you to be ready I want your your your your staff to be in hand I want you to have your feet uh shot I I I I want you to be ready to leave because at midnight amen there is coming uh the the death angel and we are fixing to leave amen now as and I want you to be diligent I want you to be ready because you're going to hear the screams of horror and Agony death is going to hit The Young and the old but I'm giving you my word that when the death angel comes that God is going to that Death Angel is going to pass over you and you are going to leave in Mighty power amen oh what it must have been amen when the death angel appeared and the death and the horror and the screams and and and and all of the agony that was coming through the city and through the nation amen what it must have been in their heart the same God that said amen that that the death angel was going to come is also the same God that s to put that blood upon the little and it'll pass over your house amen the same God that gave the promise of judgment is the same God who gave the promise of Victory amen and eternal life I I I say today as we see the the land and the shape that the world is in I say there should be a cry in a heart that God will keep his word oh God's going to keep his word amen God's promised amen that there would be the we was talking to the boys last night that amen that there would be the tidal waves and and the floods amen what what have we just seen even right there in in in North Carolina and and and and and Tennessee and some of these areas that you would never even expected the Bible said in the last days that these floods would come and and and that there would be earthquakes and diverse places when we see these things lift up your head because there's another promise it's a promise of redemption it's a promise of Salvation it's a promise of rapture it's a promise of eternal life can you say Amen now amen so there should be a vigilan in our hearts in this Exodus that we're living in there should be a fervency amen and and the fervency is looking back to what God has done knowing that God's going to fulfill his word even right now where we are at because God has always proved his words to be right amen now as Israel was to roast the Lamb with fire did you realize that fire has always been a part of worship amen fire has always been a part I if you God's a consuming fire is what the scripture says amen that that that he is a a a consuming fire and I amen I've got it u i I've got the scripture here somewhere praise the Lord do you love him here this morning amen that's right so he he is a he is a consuming fire a and and God when he would come to visit the people it was through the pillar of fire and when he come and visited Moses amen it was the great Pillar of Fire that was in a Burning Bush when amen when God appeared to any of the prophets it would be the great Pillar of Fire coming down God is always uh fire is always connected with worship you were to roast the lamb amen it it was uh there's something about the heat of fire there's there's something about God's children who has fervency because fervency is is is is it actually means amen it means hot it means burning it means glowing intense and passionate feeling having or displaying a passionate intensity intensely uh uh enthusiastic or passionate especially uh to an excessive degree so there's something about when the fire of God has touched you and and ignited his Word of Promise within your life it it actually causes something to rise up on the inside of the belie to believe him there is an intensity that comes with that fire when God touches you the Bible says that you are baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire brother bradam says what would happen was amen the fire would come down and burn the old nature out with the old desires amen it would burn amen all of the old sin and the world and amen the cravings and the desires of sin away way but it would also set your heart of Blaze with the Holy Ghost amen and that Holy Ghost would cause you to do things like you have never done before believe things like you've never believed before do things like you have never done before because it's the supernatural presence of the pillar of fire that is that has come in contact with you there has never been a man who has ever come in contact with that great Pillar of Fire that that has never been the same amen I I want to say today when you come in contact with that great fire of God Amen it does something to a man's heart it does something to a man's mind can you say amen Amen on fire with with with desire Amen brother Brandon would say he would say you know amen that a red hot Christian and a lukewarm Christian can't dwell together amen that's what's the matter today that's what makes the church the way it is we're just getting into that layout of SE in church age amen that's just lukewarm and God said it makes him sick to his stomach he will spew you out of his mouth just enough religion to go out to church and sit there like a wilted flower that's right brother we ought to have an oldfashioned RedHot prayer meeting and a testimony meeting men and women out praying and hous to house work and on the street amen doing something for God we've lost our Zeal we've lost our love we've lost what the things that God has gave us and we've let them slip out of our hands a bunch of so-called we went out after a lot of noise instead of the real oldfashioned gospel Amen in other words there's a lot of formalism amen and formalism whether you're jumping and shouting or or whether you're sitting and amen and and barely can keep your eyes open during the sermon amen for formalism is formalism you see desire comes from the heart burning intense desire Oh Glory to God you can not put your hand next to a fire amen and not know that it's that it's there can you say amen amen you take a child and you let them amen you let them get close enough and let them get their hands burnt you don't have to tell them anymore they have experienced it and I say today that the fire of God the Great pillar you want to know what happened to brother brandham and what caused brother brandham to go and go and give and go and give and go is he come in contact with fire he come in contact amen with the presence of God and he would never anymore be the same can you say Amen you see it's the sense of need that creates Earnest desire now that LE ought to see and say amen I I have need of nothing amen I I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I don't have a need amen and so there is no prevailing need amen for the supernatural intervention they they're they're satisfied with coming to church they're satisfied with just a few songs they're satisfied with doing their their Norm amen because fire is not what they're needing amen they they they're satisfied with what they have but not a son of God a Son of God must have God more than he has life a Son of God must have God more than he needs a job a Son of God needs him amen more than he needs anything else oh can you say amen Amen brother bradam would say get away from this old lukewarm halfway say a little prayer of a morning and a little prayer at night and go to bed and get up the next morning he says no wonder we're getting worldly no wonder the world creeps into the church is because we don't stay in prayer there's no more agonizing there's no more staying before God there's no more digging out and cleaning up uh why because we are satisfied amen that lukewarmness is satisfied lukewarmness is neither cold and it's neither hot amen it's just a laxness but brother I want to tell you God let the pillar of Fire come out today let the pillar of fire so touch my soul that I'll never be the same again let the great Pillar of Fire well can you say amen amen fire fire fire fire fall on me just like the day of Pentecost fire fall on me amen amen fire was always a part of worship as I was saying earlier you had to take your lamb you had to slay it but it had to be burnt with fire amen it had to be burnt with fire and praying with desire is not simply presenting our need am man but a a a desire is is a heart yearning for what we need now prayer we can bring our needs brother so and so needs sister so and so needs groceries amen we need uh a new car we need this we need that and and and those things are all wonderful prayers those are needs they man but praying with with Without fire is is uh is praying without desire but it's the desire that is yearning for what is needed amen the the praying with the desire is is is is yearning for that which we feel impaled to pray for Amen in other words desire is your will in action amen it's a strong conscious burning longing you're you there is an excitement there is something on the inner nature amen that God has something for me amen God says I can have it and I know he will keep his word amen he's proved it over and over in scripture he's proven it over over in my life he's proven it over over in the church I know that God Amen has what I need and I am needing from him can you say amen amen it's something that the that the job can't give the daddy can't give the mama can't give it's something that only God can give amen are you hearing me so it creates a desire your will goes into action you know you are God's predestinated seat you know you have the assurance and whatsoever things you desire you can have it can you say Amen now praying that that takes you into another level because now there's something that's on the inside that is longing well praise the Lord now how many's ever had a longing amen whether you want to buy a a vehicle or a amen you want a new bike or
