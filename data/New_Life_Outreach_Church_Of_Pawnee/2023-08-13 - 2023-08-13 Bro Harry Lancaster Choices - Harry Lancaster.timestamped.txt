[43:15] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[43:17] him in sincerity and in truth and put
[43:20] away the gods which your father served
[43:22] on the other side of the flood and in
[43:24] Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[43:27] and if it seem evil unto you to serve
[43:29] the Lord choose you this day whom you
[43:30] will serve whether the gods which your
[43:33] father serve that were on the other side
[43:35] of the flood or the gods of the amorites
[43:37] and whose lands ye dwell but as for me
[43:40] and my house we will serve the Lord
[43:43] let's go ahead and pray
[43:45] Lord Jesus we come into your presence
[43:47] Lord
[43:49] we thank you for
[43:51] being here Lord Jesus we thank you for
[43:53] your presence Lord
[43:56] I pray that you would just take control
[43:58] of this remaining part of the service
[44:00] Lord that
[44:01] Lord you would allow me to to say what
[44:04] you've put on My Heart Lord that it
[44:06] would just say that I would just say
[44:08] what's pleasing to you Lord that you
[44:10] would stop me from saying anything that
[44:12] that you wouldn't want said Lord and
[44:13] Lord may it just minister to the to the
[44:16] hearts of the people Lord may it meet
[44:17] the needs Lord right
[44:19] Lord we pray that you would just be be
[44:22] the one that's honored in the remainder
[44:23] of the service Lord
[44:25] we just surrender to you Lord and commit
[44:27] the service into your hands in the name
[44:30] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[44:32] you may all be seated
[44:37] in the sermon leadership brother Branham
[44:38] said
[44:40] what do you look like what are you
[44:42] following what have we done you must
[44:45] choose your leader choose today you
[44:47] choose life or death your choice will
[44:50] determine your Eternal destination what
[44:52] you choose remember Jesus said follow me
[44:55] and you're invited tonight to do so and
[44:57] to follow him to eternal life you must
[44:59] come on his term that's right the word
[45:01] not upon the Creed not upon the public
[45:04] opinion not upon what anybody else
[45:06] thinks about it but on what God said
[45:09] about it
[45:11] I'm going to talk tonight a little bit
[45:13] about choices
[45:15] now a choice is an act of selecting or
[45:19] making a decision when faced with two or
[45:21] more possibilities
[45:23] and we all know that we make choices
[45:25] throughout our day we make lots of
[45:28] choices throughout our day in fact I
[45:30] went online and just decided okay
[45:33] let's Google let's find out how many
[45:35] choices does the average person make in
[45:38] a single day and this is fully at least
[45:41] they call them semi-conscious choices so
[45:43] these are where you're making some sort
[45:45] of decision this isn't an unconscious
[45:47] choice but this is Summit conscious you
[45:49] at least have to put the slightest hint
[45:52] of thought into it and we're going to go
[45:54] ahead and start with the kids actually
[45:55] so
[45:59] Haven
[46:00] how many choices do you think you
[46:02] probably make per day
[46:09] guess a number
[46:16] you're gonna say 200.
[46:18] okay
[46:19] that's perfectly good guess
[46:22] lynnae how many do you think
[46:30] 20 okay Eliana how many choices do you
[46:33] think you make a day
[46:37] over a hundred okay charity how about
[46:39] you how many choices do you think you
[46:41] make a day
[46:43] two thousand okay she's a busy girl
[46:47] send me how many choices do you think
[46:48] you make a day
[46:49] 10
[46:51] he lives a very simple life this is this
[46:54] is a good life here Aaron how many
[46:56] choices do you think you make a day
[46:59] 600 okay Paul how about you
[47:07] come on everybody else is at a number
[47:09] you got to give me a number here
[47:11] what do you think
[47:15] 30 Okay so we've got numbers ranging
[47:19] from 10 to 2000 I think you said charity
[47:22] as the number of choices that that a
[47:25] child will make in a day
[47:27] um according to studies uh they figure
[47:31] that most children make approximately
[47:33] three thousand choices in a day
[47:36] um
[47:37] now
[47:38] for adults
[47:41] how many choices
[47:43] do we think we
[47:45] then the average adult you know I'll
[47:47] give business owners higher than this
[47:50] probably but you know average adult how
[47:52] many choices are we making in a day
[47:55] um brother Joe will let you throw a
[47:56] number out
[47:58] 8 000 okay brother Merle how many do you
[48:01] think
[48:06] [Laughter]
[48:10] he said eight thousand
[48:15] five thousand okay sister Amy how many
[48:18] do you think
[48:21] six thousand okay sister Keys how many
[48:25] do you think
[48:26] yes full participation here
[48:32] nine thousand all right brother Ken how
[48:34] about you
[48:35] ten thousand okay where everybody keeps
[48:37] going no I make more than that I make
[48:39] more than that all right let's go a
[48:41] little bit higher Robert how many do you
[48:43] think
[48:45] 6 500. all right so the I'm I'm gonna
[48:50] put this one out there first because I
[48:52] just think it's interesting
[48:53] most adults we make approximately
[48:57] just decisions about food alone
[49:04] 227 decisions per day about food alone
[49:07] the average adult
[49:09] just food no other topic
[49:12] over 200 times we are making decisions
[49:15] about food
[49:17] now we'll extrapolate this out the
[49:19] average adult
[49:20] according to studies that are put
[49:22] together by
[49:24] Cornell University and different ones
[49:26] say that the average adult makes 35 000
[49:29] decisions in a day
[49:32] now
[49:34] obviously as your level of
[49:35] responsibility increases
[49:37] so does the as they say Smorgasbord of
[49:41] choices that you're faced with you know
[49:43] business owners and those that are
[49:45] managing or those kind of things are
[49:47] probably making even more choices
[49:48] because they have to to deal with all
[49:50] these other things that are going on and
[49:52] these are all things that are you know
[49:54] just remotely conscious decisions you
[49:58] may not have had to put a ton of thought
[49:59] into it but you had to think about it
[50:02] for at least the briefest moment to make
[50:03] am I choosing Choice a or Choice B
[50:06] or C or D or
[50:08] extrapolate it out but
[50:10] um you know obviously each decision
[50:13] carries
[50:15] consequences
[50:16] that can be both good and bad and a lot
[50:19] of times your decision has both good and
[50:21] bad from it when you start to to go
[50:24] through it there's there's going to be
[50:26] good and bad there's going to be
[50:27] ramifications that come from from every
[50:29] choice every decision that we make on it
[50:31] let's turn to Proverbs chapter 4.
[50:37] Proverbs chapter 4
[50:40] and verse 23.
[50:47] keep thy heart with all diligence
[50:50] for out of it are the issues of life
[50:54] you know for a lot of these things we'll
[50:56] talk about that we make choices and like
[50:59] I said we're talking about conscious
[51:00] choices so we're putting some sort of
[51:02] thought into it so everyone will go well
[51:04] this is affected by by your brain this
[51:06] is affected by your decision making but
[51:08] even all of your decision making is
[51:10] affected by where your heart's at for
[51:13] out of it are the issues of life so keep
[51:16] thy heart with all diligence your your
[51:18] heart where you are at your core is
[51:20] actually affecting every one of these
[51:22] decisions in some way because it's
[51:25] changing the motives that you have it's
[51:27] changing what's actually important you
[51:30] know you can take the most basic choice
[51:34] but different motives will make a
[51:36] different Choice even if it's the
[51:37] simplest thing that you come down to
[51:41] brother Brandon said in the sermon
[51:43] Redeemer Redemption he said that's where
[51:45] every man has to come to in life
[51:47] sometime is make a decision you have to
[51:49] make a choice
[51:50] you got to make a choice whether he was
[51:52] going to have an education or not you
[51:54] had to make a choice who was going to be
[51:56] your wife you had to there had to be
[51:58] decisions and choices made in life and
[52:00] this may be the night that you'll have
[52:01] your final call to make your choice whom
[52:03] you're going to serve
[52:05] in a sermon leadership in 1965 he says
[52:08] but you have a choice you can do it or
[52:10] not do it you can say I don't want to so
[52:12] you have a choice after a while you have
[52:14] a choice of what girl you're going to
[52:15] marry what boy you're going to marry you
[52:17] have a choice everywhere in life then
[52:20] you've got a choice again to whether you
[52:21] want to live after this life or just be
[52:23] a good popular person a movie star or a
[52:26] dancer or something each one of us has
[52:28] to make a choice and it's confronted to
[52:30] us but we're all confronted with this
[52:31] one thing what are we going to do about
[52:34] eternal life we're going to live
[52:35] Hereafter or not then we have to come to
[52:38] Jesus to get that that opportunity of
[52:40] choosing that's the one thing God gave
[52:41] us he don't force nothing on us he just
[52:43] lets us make our own choice so you have
[52:45] to not be forced but just make your own
[52:48] choice
[52:49] and again in the Kinsmen Redeemer in
[52:51] 1960 brother Branham says but oh how I
[52:54] like that little Ruth she had to make a
[52:56] decision I had to make a decision you've
[52:59] got to make a decision You'll Never Walk
[53:01] out of these doors this morning without
[53:02] some kind of a decision you'll not leave
[53:04] this room today either being a better
[53:06] man or woman or a worse man or woman to
[53:09] reject it you'll be worse it'll be
[53:11] harder the next time for you to get to
[53:12] it or you'll go out better it comes to a
[53:15] showdown in her life it comes to a
[53:18] showdown in everybody's life and Ruth
[53:20] had to make a decision so the Bible said
[53:22] that her mother-in-law told her go back
[53:24] to your Gods like your sister did go
[53:25] back like the lukewarm did why don't you
[53:28] go on back the gospel preacher if you
[53:30] want to go go on the real truthful
[53:32] preacher that'll put it before a class
[53:33] of people you make your decision you
[53:35] stand on your feet lukewarm wishy-washy
[53:38] in and out won't say that but a real
[53:40] servant of God will lay it on your lap
[53:42] make your decision Ruth said I'll go
[53:44] where you go your people will be my
[53:46] people your God will be my God where you
[53:48] live I live where you die I'll die and
[53:51] where you're buried I'll be buried
[53:52] that's the real decision
[53:55] so we all know that the most important
[53:57] choice that we can make is whether or
[53:58] not we'll accept Christ as our Lord and
[54:00] savior all of us have made that choice
[54:03] which is why we're here in this building
[54:05] right now
[54:10] Choice after Choice after choice in our
[54:12] walk with Christ it isn't I made that
[54:14] one choice and I never have to think
[54:16] about it again I never have to make
[54:17] another Choice it was
[54:19] do you keep having more things coming up
[54:21] the devil decides okay now I can really
[54:23] throw the questions at you now I can
[54:25] really throw everything at you
[54:29] you know every time that we make choices
[54:32] as I mentioned earlier you have both the
[54:35] good and the bad that come from it often
[54:36] at the same time you know looking at it
[54:38] from the natural for a moment
[54:41] if
[54:42] we're making what most people would
[54:44] classify as a good choice I'm going to
[54:46] choose to maintain a healthy diet and
[54:48] exercise
[54:49] there are still consequences that come
[54:51] from that choice
[54:52] you know I have obviously the positives
[54:54] I'm gonna it's gonna be good for me and
[54:57] helping me to stay fit and healthy and
[54:59] I'm probably going to be able to to live
[55:02] longer and all these kind of different
[55:03] things
[55:04] but it also does have the negative
[55:05] consequence of it's going to restrict
[55:07] how much I can enjoy some of my favorite
[55:09] junk Foods
[55:10] it's going to restrict how much I can
[55:12] enjoy doing certain activities or doing
[55:15] these kind of things because I have to
[55:16] focus time and energy on making sure
[55:18] that I'm staying healthy that's not bad
[55:21] necessarily but they're still both a
[55:23] positive and a negative from this Choice
[55:25] most people would look at and say that's
[55:27] a good choice you've made they're still
[55:29] negative that comes from it you still
[55:31] have to look at both sides when you make
[55:32] the choice
[55:33] you know
[55:35] this is one where
[55:37] um you know choosing to partake in
[55:39] illegal drugs
[55:42] there's the positive it gives you
[55:44] enjoyment for a short time
[55:46] brother Joe am I correct in saying that
[55:48] for a short time you have enjoyment of
[55:52] some sort there is some sort of pleasure
[55:54] that comes from it
[55:56] but then there's also negatives that
[55:58] come from it
[55:59] brother Joe what would be some of the
[56:01] negatives
[56:02] yes I'm picking on you tonight sorry
[56:04] what are what just
[56:07] everything okay just everything that
[56:09] goes out there so uh you know you have
[56:11] negatives come from how it affects your
[56:13] body
[56:14] you have negatives that come from uh
[56:16] that you can get on the wrong side of
[56:17] the law there's negatives that come from
[56:19] uh the cost that it is from from a
[56:22] financial standpoint and all these
[56:24] different things so yes there's what
[56:26] could be classified as a positive I get
[56:28] momentary enjoyment from it but there's
[56:30] also all these negatives that go with it
[56:32] you know telling a lie can sometimes get
[56:36] you out of a situation and possibly even
[56:38] prevent you from getting in trouble
[56:40] I'm sure all you kids know about this we
[56:42] go hey if I tell mom or dad this lie I
[56:44] can keep from being in trouble
[56:46] this is a positive this is a good thing
[56:49] I do not have to be in trouble for
[56:51] breaking mom's vase
[56:54] I can lie it wasn't me it was the doc it
[56:56] was the cat it was the whatever but it
[56:59] wasn't me
[57:01] but then you have the negatives from it
[57:03] where
[57:05] you can when it's finally found out
[57:07] because the truth always eventually
[57:09] comes out it can damage the person's
[57:13] faith and trust that they've begun to
[57:14] put in you you know if you lie to your
[57:17] parents they've begun to feel like okay
[57:18] I can Eliana I can trust you I can trust
[57:20] you to handle this trust you to handle
[57:22] that and then you get caught in a lie
[57:24] and now mom's going maybe I can't trust
[57:26] Iliana quite as much
[57:28] as I did maybe I can't trust charity
[57:31] quite as much as I thought that I could
[57:35] yeah so there's what we feel like is a
[57:37] positive I'm protecting myself from
[57:39] being in trouble there's also this
[57:41] negative that comes with it
[57:44] you know for uh
[57:46] for our electricians in the group there
[57:48] are when you choose to study and pass
[57:51] the test to become a journeyman
[57:52] electrician
[57:54] there are positives this allows you to
[57:56] be able to to make more money this
[57:58] allows you to be able to probably have
[57:59] more seniority this allows you to be
[58:01] able to uh do more do different types of
[58:04] work and have a better career path
[58:09] but at the same time by making the
[58:11] decision to put your time and effort
[58:13] into this you're at the same time
[58:15] deciding not to go this career route not
[58:19] to go that route
[58:21] now that's not anything necessarily bad
[58:23] for that but that is some of the
[58:25] consequence you've taken the time to
[58:27] dedicate to this is what I want to do I
[58:29] want to do this to be a journeyman
[58:31] an electrician
[58:33] well that means you're probably not
[58:35] studying to be
[58:37] a fast food manager you're probably not
[58:39] studying to run a restaurant you're not
[58:41] probably not studying to do this
[58:44] every single one of the choices that we
[58:45] make throughout life in the natural you
[58:48] can look at and go okay here's positive
[58:50] and here's negative that comes from it
[58:53] and each one of us are continually
[58:55] making the decisions and weighing it out
[58:57] on okay does the positive outweigh the
[58:59] negative is this what I where I want to
[59:02] go is this the better or worse you know
[59:04] we talked about the illegal drug side
[59:06] here's the small positive here's the big
[59:08] negatives so it's probably a bad
[59:10] decision I probably don't want to do
[59:12] this
[59:12] you know the eating healthy and do and
[59:15] and exercising doing all this okay
[59:17] here's the positives here's the negative
[59:20] right the positives probably outweigh
[59:22] the negative so it's probably a good
[59:23] decision obviously it's not what I'm
[59:25] making but it would be a good decision
[59:27] if I did make it
[59:29] every choice that we make
[59:32] will affect us
[59:34] now like we said we know that the most
[59:37] important decision that we make is to
[59:39] follow Christ
[59:40] we make that first step we make that
[59:42] first decision that okay he's going to
[59:44] be my Lord and Savior
[59:46] but then we keep making decisions we
[59:49] keep making decisions to go can't am I
[59:52] truly going to fully trust him am I
[59:54] truly going to accept every word that
[59:56] he's laid out am I truly going to give
[59:58] my all into this
[1:00:01] and it's something we weigh out back and
[1:00:03] forth through our life because you're
[1:00:05] going can I fully trust him
[1:00:07] or do I need to keep some of this on my
[1:00:09] plate
[1:00:10] do I need to try to handle some of this
[1:00:18] brother Branham said in the sermon
[1:00:20] blind Bartimaeus he says bless you my
[1:00:22] brother that's fine right now you've got
[1:00:24] to make a decision you can't go out that
[1:00:26] door the same person you're in the
[1:00:28] presence of God you'll either go out
[1:00:30] that door a better man or woman or worse
[1:00:32] by rejecting this might be the last time
[1:00:35] you'll ever reject it it might be I hope
[1:00:37] not but it may be but now while he's
[1:00:39] knocking and giving one more if you feel
[1:00:41] something at your heart saying yes you
[1:00:43] ought to raise your hand and accept me
[1:00:45] you know why
[1:00:47] in the sermon God of this evil age
[1:00:50] brother Branham said the outside man is
[1:00:52] a physical being which is controlled by
[1:00:54] six senses or five senses rather the
[1:00:56] Inside Man is a spirit man which is
[1:00:58] controlled by five senses conscience and
[1:01:00] love and so forth the outside man see
[1:01:02] feel taste smell here but the inside of
[1:01:05] that spirit is a soul and is controlled
[1:01:07] by one thing your free will
[1:01:10] you can accept what the devil says or
[1:01:12] accept What God Says and that'll
[1:01:14] determine what spirit is in there if
[1:01:16] it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the
[1:01:18] things of God and it won't feed on
[1:01:20] anything of the world
[1:01:21] Jesus said if you love the world or the
[1:01:23] things of the world it's because the
[1:01:25] love of God has not even entered the
[1:01:26] inner part Satan has deceived you and
[1:01:29] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:01:31] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:01:33] mouth of God
[1:01:35] brother Brandon told the story where he
[1:01:37] was talking to the the Indian Chief and
[1:01:39] the Indian chief was describing to him
[1:01:40] how
[1:01:41] well inside there's a white dog and a
[1:01:43] black dog that are fighting
[1:01:45] and brother Brandon said okay so which
[1:01:47] one wins well whichever one I feed the
[1:01:49] most
[1:01:50] so
[1:01:51] he was saying as a Christian because he
[1:01:54] had already accepted Christ
[1:01:56] this was one of brother branham's
[1:01:58] converts and he was but he was still
[1:02:00] saying that nature is still there and
[1:02:02] brother random talked about that that
[1:02:03] flesh nature is still there trying to
[1:02:06] raise back up it's trying to grab
[1:02:08] control it's trying to to take over and
[1:02:11] so we constantly have that that choice
[1:02:13] that that wrestling back and forth
[1:02:15] between which way are we going to go
[1:02:17] now this isn't changing our Salvation
[1:02:20] this isn't saying if you make the bad
[1:02:22] choice today you're lost I heard uh
[1:02:25] brother Merle talk about the uh you know
[1:02:27] once saved always saved
[1:02:29] um and I'm gonna go on those yes if if
[1:02:32] saved then always saved that's that's
[1:02:35] the way I like the phrase it is if you
[1:02:37] were once saved then you're always saved
[1:02:39] that's the If part that's between you
[1:02:41] and God to figure out but you have that
[1:02:43] white dog and black dog that are
[1:02:44] fighting within you
[1:02:46] and so you're constantly making the
[1:02:48] choice of what am I feeding on what am I
[1:02:51] taking in what am I consuming which one
[1:02:53] am I giving it to
[1:02:55] am I allowing myself to go into a state
[1:02:57] of mind where I'm focusing more on
[1:02:59] things of the world I'm focusing more on
[1:03:01] the worldly entertainments and oh man
[1:03:04] the newest Marvel movie came out I need
[1:03:05] to binge all of them so I can keep up on
[1:03:07] the storyline
[1:03:08] and I'm going to dedicate this many
[1:03:10] hours to the next thing so that way I
[1:03:12] know what's going on
[1:03:14] and now the black dog's getting stronger
[1:03:17] and stronger and stronger
[1:03:19] or am I going okay you know what I'm
[1:03:21] gonna actually take all the time today
[1:03:23] and I'm going to listen to an entire
[1:03:25] brother Branham sermon today not just
[1:03:27] the 20 minutes in the car as I drive to
[1:03:29] job but I'm actually going to sit down
[1:03:30] and listen to the entire sermon
[1:03:33] I'm not saying you have to listen to one
[1:03:34] of the six hour sermons but you know
[1:03:36] when I'm gonna listen to one of the
[1:03:38] two-hour sermons I'm gonna put it I'm
[1:03:39] gonna give that much time to make sure
[1:03:42] that I'm feeding the right dog
[1:03:47] and I have to keep making those
[1:03:49] decisions this isn't a one-time thing of
[1:03:52] great I'm done this is what I'm doing
[1:03:54] but it's a constant decision over and
[1:03:57] over and over now we can build that into
[1:03:59] a habit a habit comes from constantly
[1:04:02] making the same Choice over and over and
[1:04:05] over to where it now becomes easy to
[1:04:07] make the choice because it's built into
[1:04:09] your routine
[1:04:10] I always tell my wife that I admire her
[1:04:13] for the fact that she is so good about
[1:04:16] making sure that every morning she gets
[1:04:18] up and she has her devotion time with
[1:04:20] the Lord and she has time to exercise
[1:04:23] every morning
[1:04:25] this is what and most mornings she gets
[1:04:28] all this done before the kids get up
[1:04:30] and it throws her day into a tizzy if
[1:04:34] the kids get up before she's done
[1:04:37] because she wants this is her quiet time
[1:04:39] in the morning she gets to do her
[1:04:41] devotion with no one pulling on her no
[1:04:43] one yelling Mama it's just her and the
[1:04:46] Lord and then she does her exercise time
[1:04:48] so she's gotten everything set and then
[1:04:50] she's ready to face the day and this is
[1:04:52] part of her normal routine it's
[1:04:55] something she does on a daily basis she
[1:04:58] doesn't even have to think about it
[1:04:59] anymore she gets up and the first thing
[1:05:02] she does is roll into this
[1:05:04] unless it's a weird day where she
[1:05:06] overslept and it's a struggle but in
[1:05:08] general this is the normal every day we
[1:05:10] get up and we do these things
[1:05:12] and then after that's her cup of coffee
[1:05:15] get these two done and then we move on
[1:05:16] to the coffee
[1:05:18] has the energy to keep going but she has
[1:05:21] this discipline down because she's made
[1:05:23] the choice over and over and over and
[1:05:27] over to where now it's just normal
[1:05:30] she doesn't have to wake up and go what
[1:05:33] am I going to do this morning
[1:05:35] she wakes up and she starts her routine
[1:05:37] because this is what she does
[1:05:39] how many of us working guys that we wake
[1:05:41] up and immediately start our routine to
[1:05:44] get ready for the day
[1:05:46] whether that's devotion time whether
[1:05:48] that's just getting your clothes ready
[1:05:50] and getting ready to go to work
[1:05:52] you have your routine and particularly
[1:05:55] when you're going to work and you've got
[1:05:57] a job probably starts at this time I've
[1:05:59] got to do this through this you've got
[1:06:00] this routine that's built in and you
[1:06:02] don't have to think about it
[1:06:04] you get up
[1:06:06] and you do this because these are the
[1:06:08] choices that you've made over and over
[1:06:10] and over
[1:06:11] now anytime you start a new job you have
[1:06:14] to rebuild this
[1:06:15] unless it happens to be a job where it's
[1:06:17] starting the exact same time and all
[1:06:18] these kind of things but in general you
[1:06:20] start a new career I know brother Robert
[1:06:22] started working at a bank not that long
[1:06:24] ago
[1:06:25] and so he had to build a new routine
[1:06:27] okay this is how my morning goes I get
[1:06:30] up at this time I do these things I
[1:06:32] leave to go to work
[1:06:34] whatever that routine looks like
[1:06:37] and then he has to make that choice
[1:06:38] every day
[1:06:40] over and over and over until it becomes
[1:06:43] something that he's almost not thinking
[1:06:45] about anymore because it is
[1:06:47] the normal it is what he does every
[1:06:50] single day
[1:06:51] there are people that look at the fact
[1:06:53] that
[1:06:54] we go to church twice on Sundays
[1:06:57] and we go to church on Wednesdays
[1:06:59] and they go how do you have time yeah
[1:07:02] how do you do this how do you do that
[1:07:04] and we're like
[1:07:05] when we don't have church on Sunday
[1:07:07] night we don't know what to do with
[1:07:08] ourselves it's like what do we do now
[1:07:11] there's
[1:07:12] service is dismissed in the afternoon
[1:07:14] what's happening what are we going what
[1:07:17] where are we going what's doing it you
[1:07:19] know we don't know what restaurants are
[1:07:20] really open we don't know what stores
[1:07:22] are open because we don't do anything on
[1:07:24] Sundays we go to church because this is
[1:07:26] our normal we've made the decision over
[1:07:30] and over and over to go I'm gonna be at
[1:07:34] church
[1:07:36] the whole day
[1:07:37] I'm gonna be at church Wednesday night
[1:07:41] I may be rushing I may be rolling in
[1:07:44] right as the pastor's coming up to
[1:07:45] preach but I'm going to be there
[1:07:48] because that's the decision that we've
[1:07:50] made to where now this is fully a habit
[1:07:53] this is a choice that we've made over
[1:07:55] and over and over
[1:07:59] so that it begins to become habit but
[1:08:02] until you have habits established those
[1:08:04] choices can be a struggle
[1:08:06] those choices can be so hard to make
[1:08:09] sometimes
[1:08:10] and those are the ones that Satan will
[1:08:12] attack the most are those decisions when
[1:08:15] you're trying to make the choice and
[1:08:17] you're trying to start this good thing
[1:08:19] going in your life you're trying to go
[1:08:21] you know
[1:08:22] I had conviction while I was at church
[1:08:24] and I know
[1:08:28] I'm just going to go ahead and be open
[1:08:30] and vulnerable here for a moment I have
[1:08:32] always struggled
[1:08:34] with being fully consistent on having a
[1:08:38] nighttime devotion time with my family
[1:08:41] it's
[1:08:42] it's like we get through dinner and then
[1:08:45] we're rushing around getting everything
[1:08:46] cleaned up getting kids ready for bed
[1:08:49] I've always had an early morning job so
[1:08:51] I want to get a bed at a decent hour so
[1:08:53] I can get enough sleep so I can do this
[1:08:54] so I can do that
[1:08:57] and it's
[1:08:58] it's so easy for that to begin to slip
[1:09:01] off
[1:09:02] and I'll have a sermon we'll go through
[1:09:05] some services or things where I'll
[1:09:06] really get it on me okay I've got to get
[1:09:09] better at this I've got to make sure
[1:09:10] that we're doing this
[1:09:12] and in some ways it's almost become a
[1:09:14] laughing in my family because I'll go
[1:09:16] all right we're getting to devotion
[1:09:17] night
[1:09:19] and my daughter will be like
[1:09:21] how long is it going to last
[1:09:24] you know in three in two three days
[1:09:26] she's going so Daddy are we still doing
[1:09:28] devotion tonight or can I go to my room
[1:09:29] are we still doing this or that and
[1:09:32] she's not the only one all my kids will
[1:09:34] do the same thing and they'll kind of be
[1:09:36] picking at me
[1:09:37] are you gonna be able to do it are we
[1:09:39] gonna stick with it
[1:09:40] are we gonna make sure you know how does
[1:09:43] devotion work on Wednesday night we're
[1:09:46] already going to church
[1:09:48] what does devotion look like
[1:09:54] parrot Church all day on Sunday what
[1:09:57] does devotion look like on Sunday
[1:09:59] I don't know I've never figured out
[1:10:01] Sunday and Wednesday it
[1:10:03] doesn't quite clicken me and this is one
[1:10:05] of the areas that I know I struggle as a
[1:10:08] father and I struggle as a husband going
[1:10:10] how do I lead this well with my family
[1:10:14] how do I do this well to ensure that my
[1:10:17] kids know
[1:10:18] hey this is important
[1:10:21] and I know part of my struggle comes
[1:10:22] from the fact my family growing up
[1:10:25] wasn't great at this now I will be the
[1:10:27] first to say my mom was great at the
[1:10:30] devotion
[1:10:31] she built it into our school every
[1:10:33] morning I had devotion
[1:10:36] my mom led us in devotion we had morning
[1:10:38] where we'd read scriptures we would
[1:10:40] listen to however long of a message
[1:10:43] um
[1:10:44] it was either 15 or 20 minutes something
[1:10:45] like that and we'd normally do a message
[1:10:48] in a week maybe two weeks but we'd
[1:10:51] constantly this was part of our school
[1:10:52] work 8 A.M in the school room
[1:10:55] starting devotion first thing you did
[1:10:58] for school every morning
[1:11:00] there was consistency we knew it was
[1:11:02] going to happen
[1:11:04] that didn't happen with a family
[1:11:06] devotion
[1:11:08] and so when I became a dad became an
[1:11:11] adult that's
[1:11:13] just been an area that I've always
[1:11:14] struggled with
[1:11:16] now I can sit down I can talk with my
[1:11:18] family about stuff
[1:11:19] I can answer questions
[1:11:21] but to sit down and actually do a full
[1:11:23] devotion
[1:11:25] it's just one of my areas
[1:11:28] that I figure out I don't know how many
[1:11:31] other dads struggle with that but that's
[1:11:32] mine
[1:11:34] I'll be glad to commiserate a little bit
[1:11:36] maybe you can share ideas on how to do
[1:11:37] better
[1:11:39] but I've had that's a choice that I
[1:11:42] struggle to begin to set the habit
[1:11:44] when after those really good services or
[1:11:47] after I've had that time with the Lord
[1:11:48] going I've got to get better at this and
[1:11:51] you begin to make that choice okay we're
[1:11:52] doing it tonight okay we're doing it
[1:11:54] tonight
[1:11:55] and then you have the night come up
[1:11:57] where everything was weird
[1:11:58] and I worked extra late because of
[1:12:01] meetings and when I got home my wife had
[1:12:04] had an awful day and so we were behind
[1:12:06] on everything and so I'm trying to help
[1:12:09] her get the house back in order get the
[1:12:11] kids cleaned up get whatever done
[1:12:16] and then the day's gone
[1:12:19] and it didn't happen
[1:12:21] and somewhere in there I missed making
[1:12:24] the right choice
[1:12:28] and sometimes it's even hard to look
[1:12:29] back to go I don't even know where I
[1:12:31] would have made the choice
[1:12:32] but somewhere I missed it
[1:12:34] somewhere I missed making the right
[1:12:37] right choice it doesn't mean that I made
[1:12:40] bad choices
[1:12:42] I wasn't leaving my family to go out and
[1:12:46] drink or go to do this or go to do that
[1:12:50] none of the things that I did were bad
[1:12:56] but I still allowed myself to be
[1:12:58] distracted and so I didn't make the
[1:13:00] better choice I made choices throughout
[1:13:03] the evening
[1:13:04] I made choices to go
[1:13:07] my wife's stressed I need to step in and
[1:13:09] help with
[1:13:10] dishes help with
[1:13:12] wrangling Silas for a while so she can
[1:13:15] have a little bit of time or doing
[1:13:17] whatever I made choices
[1:13:21] but then at the end of the night I'm
[1:13:22] looking back going did I make the best
[1:13:24] choice
[1:13:25] or should there have been a different
[1:13:26] choice where I went even if it was just
[1:13:28] to go hey 10 minutes y'all sit down
[1:13:32] there are things to be done it's not
[1:13:34] gonna be more than that but 10 minutes
[1:13:36] read a scripture pray we're done maybe
[1:13:39] it's gonna be less than ten but at least
[1:13:41] we've still kept it going
[1:13:46] but I look back and go I didn't make
[1:13:48] that choice
[1:13:49] I allowed myself to be distracted and
[1:13:51] focused on other choices that needed to
[1:13:53] be made other decisions that needed to
[1:13:55] be made
[1:13:56] and so throughout our life
[1:14:00] we keep having these choices come up
[1:14:03] and that one was easy for me to harp on
[1:14:05] because it's all about me
[1:14:07] I don't know what the choices are in
[1:14:09] your life that you're continually going
[1:14:10] back and forth with but each one of us
[1:14:12] has these places where Satan goes hey
[1:14:14] this is the place the armor is not quite
[1:14:16] as tight
[1:14:18] the armors
[1:14:19] need still needs to be buckled a little
[1:14:21] bit more let me keep throwing in
[1:14:22] something to mess with this choice that
[1:14:25] they're making to mess with this
[1:14:26] decision
[1:14:28] and it doesn't mean that you're making a
[1:14:31] bad
[1:14:32] decision it doesn't mean that you're
[1:14:34] going off and sinning now maybe you are
[1:14:37] maybe that's the choice you're making
[1:14:39] maybe you're going into something that's
[1:14:41] wrong
[1:14:42] but that's not always the way Satan
[1:14:44] attacks us a lot of times he'll have you
[1:14:46] keep making the choice that just keeps
[1:14:49] you busy
[1:14:50] that just keeps you focused on other
[1:14:52] things that just keeps you distracted
[1:14:55] we're still making choices but he's
[1:14:58] preventing you from making the choices
[1:15:00] often enough to build the Habit to where
[1:15:03] you don't even have to think about it
[1:15:04] anymore
[1:15:05] like I said my wife can do that with her
[1:15:07] devotions every morning she almost
[1:15:09] doesn't have to think about it it's just
[1:15:10] part of her day
[1:15:13] I wish the night devotions for us that I
[1:15:16] had made the decisions where it was that
[1:15:17] easy
[1:15:18] that we didn't even have to think about
[1:15:19] it that we just rolled in it happened
[1:15:22] and we kept going
[1:15:24] and each one of us has those types of
[1:15:26] things in our life where we have some
[1:15:28] things that we've built into habits
[1:15:30] because we've made the choice over and
[1:15:32] over and over
[1:15:33] and we have other things that are
[1:15:35] constant struggle because we haven't
[1:15:37] made the choice over and over
[1:15:42] in Joshua chapter 2 we have the story of
[1:15:45] Rahab
[1:15:47] and brother Branham talks about about
[1:15:50] rahabi
[1:15:51] talks about a little bit in the sermon
[1:15:53] God's wrapped gift in 1960 he says Rahab
[1:15:57] the Harlot that we're all familiar with
[1:15:59] she being a young girl was turned on the
[1:16:01] street by a heathen father and mother
[1:16:02] that put her on the street because she
[1:16:04] was beautiful and was to bring in income
[1:16:06] to them on prostitution and
[1:16:08] get down in this immoral girl that was
[1:16:11] turned on the street she had heard there
[1:16:13] was a God who answered prayer
[1:16:15] and the first opportunity that she got
[1:16:17] to accept that God or do something for
[1:16:19] him she did it and God spared her life
[1:16:22] and saved her father and mother and her
[1:16:24] family
[1:16:25] she fell in love with a general in the
[1:16:27] army of Israel we find in history and
[1:16:28] married this General and their courtship
[1:16:30] was wonderful and finally they settled
[1:16:32] down and lived in Bethlehem
[1:16:42] now some of the ways that the way
[1:16:44] brother Brandon presents it some of this
[1:16:45] was outside her realm of choices someone
[1:16:48] else made a choice that affected her
[1:16:52] she was turned out by her parents to
[1:16:54] have this way as
[1:16:56] her way of making a living
[1:16:58] that was a choice she didn't make
[1:17:00] now at some point it became her choice
[1:17:03] at some point she continued the path she
[1:17:06] continued making that decision
[1:17:09] so it may not have started out as her
[1:17:11] choice but eventually it became her
[1:17:12] choice
[1:17:13] but at the same time she's going through
[1:17:15] this
[1:17:16] she's she's making these choices she
[1:17:19] begins to hear about the God of Israel
[1:17:22] The God Who answers prayer the God who
[1:17:24] destroyed Egypt The God Who split the
[1:17:27] Red Sea
[1:17:29] The God Who split the Jordan River
[1:17:32] she begins to hear these stories and she
[1:17:35] begins to
[1:17:36] to know that there's something different
[1:17:38] here this isn't the same kind of tales
[1:17:40] that she's heard about the false gods
[1:17:41] that are around there these are about
[1:17:43] there's something more real about this
[1:17:46] and something that I found interesting
[1:17:48] about this story when I actually took
[1:17:49] the time to think about and study about
[1:17:51] it here you have a woman that is you
[1:17:55] know living the life of a harlot this is
[1:17:58] her job her income so no one would think
[1:18:02] the slightest bit about two strange men
[1:18:05] coming into her house
[1:18:07] that would not raise a red flag anywhere
[1:18:11] great two more guys showed up
[1:18:13] the neighbors are complaining because of
[1:18:15] the type of business she has but they're
[1:18:17] not getting wondering who are these two
[1:18:19] men where did they come from
[1:18:22] why are they here
[1:18:23] they think they know all those answers
[1:18:25] already
[1:18:27] and so here you have what was actually
[1:18:30] the perfect cover for them
[1:18:32] to come into this house
[1:18:35] because it wouldn't immediately raise
[1:18:37] red flags it wouldn't immediately cause
[1:18:39] alarm to have two strange men come into
[1:18:42] rahab's house
[1:18:43] but then you have Rahab who now she has
[1:18:47] her first real major choice
[1:18:51] she can choose
[1:18:53] to turn them over
[1:18:55] she can turn choose to to give them over
[1:18:58] to uh the officials of the city and let
[1:19:01] them know that these are spies come in
[1:19:04] or she can make the choice
[1:19:06] to side with the god of Israel
[1:19:09] and so Rahab makes her choice
[1:19:12] she goes and she hides them when people
[1:19:14] come to question her about the two men
[1:19:16] she says I didn't know where they went
[1:19:17] but I do know that they left they were
[1:19:19] going out and you know I didn't know
[1:19:20] that they were spies that were here you
[1:19:22] know all this kind of stuff
[1:19:24] and she gives them cover she hides them
[1:19:26] under the Flax on the roof
[1:19:27] and then she talks to them and she goes
[1:19:29] I saved your life
[1:19:32] you owe me mine
[1:19:34] you owe me mine and my families we've
[1:19:37] heard about everything with the god of
[1:19:39] Israel we've heard of everything he can
[1:19:40] do
[1:19:41] and I just want to live
[1:19:43] this is all I'm going for I want me and
[1:19:46] my family to live
[1:19:48] and she makes her decision she makes her
[1:19:50] choice and this would have been such a
[1:19:53] hard choice because this was brand new
[1:19:56] this was not a habit she was used to
[1:19:57] making this was not a choice that had
[1:20:00] been developed over and over and over
[1:20:01] this was going against everything she
[1:20:04] had ever learned ever been taught
[1:20:06] everything she'd ever experienced
[1:20:09] she was used to men that wouldn't keep
[1:20:11] their word to her
[1:20:13] she was used to men that would come in
[1:20:15] give her money and leave
[1:20:18] there were no promises there was no hope
[1:20:20] for a better life there was nothing
[1:20:23] and yet now she was going to take these
[1:20:25] two men
[1:20:27] complete strangers and she was going to
[1:20:29] take them at their word
[1:20:32] she was going to accept that they would
[1:20:34] be actually thinking about what was best
[1:20:36] for her
[1:20:38] that they would actually be willing to
[1:20:41] stand up for her and protect her when
[1:20:44] she had had a life of men
[1:20:47] shoving her to the side shoving her down
[1:20:49] not receiving any of the protection that
[1:20:52] she should have had
[1:20:53] she had had a father that sent her out
[1:20:56] to be a working girl like this
[1:20:57] the man that should have protected her
[1:20:59] that should have kept her safe was the
[1:21:01] same one that sent her into this life
[1:21:03] and yet now she has these two men
[1:21:07] and she accepts their word
[1:21:10] I'll let you out the window
[1:21:12] and I'm gonna believe
[1:21:14] your word that my family and I will be
[1:21:16] safe
[1:21:20] this wasn't an easy choice
[1:21:23] this wasn't something that you know hey
[1:21:26] it's nice we read through the story wow
[1:21:27] Rahab was so great she made this choice
[1:21:29] to protect them this was not an easy
[1:21:31] Choice when you start to break it down
[1:21:33] and boil it down this was not simple
[1:21:38] as she watched those two men flee slide
[1:21:41] down the Rope disappear into the night
[1:21:44] I guarantee she was thinking they'll
[1:21:46] never be back
[1:21:49] because she had had man after man that
[1:21:51] had did that throughout her life
[1:21:56] that had told her something that had
[1:21:58] made her a promise and then never kept
[1:22:00] it
[1:22:02] but yet she was willing to make the
[1:22:04] choice
[1:22:05] and go no this is what I'm gonna do
[1:22:08] I've heard about this God
[1:22:11] and if these two men are representing
[1:22:13] that God
[1:22:15] I can make this choice I can make this
[1:22:17] decision this can be different
[1:22:24] it wasn't an easy choice but she made it
[1:22:26] and then
[1:22:29] her life did change
[1:22:30] because she became one of
[1:22:34] the Blessed women she was within the
[1:22:37] lineage
[1:22:39] of Jesus Christ
[1:22:42] she got to come from this place of
[1:22:45] being basically the lowest of the low
[1:22:49] to where she now Becomes of one of those
[1:22:51] you talk about is she was in this line
[1:22:54] she was in the line of David in the line
[1:22:57] of Jesus
[1:22:59] this is what she became elevated to this
[1:23:02] is what because she made a choice
[1:23:05] and it wasn't an easy choice
[1:23:12] in Genesis chapter 25
[1:23:16] we have Jacob and Esau
[1:23:19] and we're going to jump in on verse 29
[1:23:21] in chapter Genesis chapter 25 verse 29.
[1:23:26] and Jacob sod pottage
[1:23:29] and Esau came from the field and he was
[1:23:31] faint
[1:23:32] and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray
[1:23:34] thee with that same red podage fry my
[1:23:37] faint therefore was his name called Edom
[1:23:40] and Jacob said sell me this day thy
[1:23:42] Birthright
[1:23:43] and Esau said behold I'm at the point to
[1:23:46] die and what prophet shall this
[1:23:48] Birthright do to me
[1:23:50] and Jacob said swear to me this day and
[1:23:52] he swear unto him and he sold his
[1:23:53] Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave
[1:23:56] Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he
[1:23:58] did eat and drink and Rose up and went
[1:23:59] his way thus Esau despised his
[1:24:02] Birthright
[1:24:09] both of these men had their choices
[1:24:12] and this was one of those pivotal
[1:24:15] moments in them where their choice came
[1:24:18] down
[1:24:20] Jacob wanted the birthright
[1:24:23] Esau being the oldest had the birthright
[1:24:27] but Jacob wanted it
[1:24:29] he wanted to be the one who the family
[1:24:31] name went down through he wanted to be
[1:24:33] the one who uh
[1:24:35] everything funneled through he wanted to
[1:24:37] be the one that represented the family
[1:24:43] he won he had heard about Father Abraham
[1:24:46] her grandfather Abraham and everything
[1:24:48] that it that had happened and how God
[1:24:50] had called him and how he had walked
[1:24:52] through the land and all these kind of
[1:24:53] things
[1:24:54] and he wanted to be the one
[1:24:57] but Esau had the title Esau had the
[1:25:00] claim because Esau was the firstborn
[1:25:03] and it came down and
[1:25:05] Jacob says sell me your Birthright
[1:25:08] now Esau
[1:25:11] could have gotten up and walked to the
[1:25:12] next tent over
[1:25:14] and said hey Mom I'm hungry
[1:25:17] or hey Dad I'm hungry or hey servants
[1:25:19] I'm hungry and then waited for them to
[1:25:22] cook some food
[1:25:25] he could have
[1:25:27] but Esau made the choice that what's
[1:25:30] this Birthright worth
[1:25:32] great it's a great title
[1:25:34] I have the birthright yay
[1:25:38] he didn't care
[1:25:40] and so he made the choice that it wasn't
[1:25:42] worth anything
[1:25:44] so great the food that I'm going to
[1:25:46] enjoy right now that's what I need
[1:25:49] I need the strength right this moment
[1:25:51] why should I have to wait the birthright
[1:25:54] all it does is get me blessings after
[1:25:56] Dad dies who knows how long that's gonna
[1:25:59] be
[1:26:00] or I can eat the food right now
[1:26:04] he made the choice of this is what's
[1:26:06] valuable now
[1:26:09] and Jacob made the choice of this is
[1:26:11] what I want I'm willing to work fight
[1:26:14] deceive lie steal whatever as long as I
[1:26:19] get that
[1:26:21] this is everything
[1:26:25] and so God would look down and go
[1:26:27] Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated
[1:26:32] not because he made them make their
[1:26:35] decisions
[1:26:38] as we know it's
[1:26:39] not a
[1:26:41] predestination comes from for knowledge
[1:26:44] brother Brandon talked about that that
[1:26:46] it isn't that
[1:26:48] God predestinate predestined you and
[1:26:51] made you make the choices
[1:26:53] but God foreknew he knew what your
[1:26:55] choices would be so he could
[1:26:57] predestinate where you would end up
[1:26:59] because he knew what your choices would
[1:27:01] be
[1:27:02] for knowledge brought about
[1:27:04] predestination because God could
[1:27:06] foreknow it all so God could look down
[1:27:08] at these two that hadn't even been born
[1:27:10] yet
[1:27:11] and know their decisions
[1:27:13] not because he forced them to make
[1:27:15] decisions not because he was sitting
[1:27:17] there like puppets on a string making
[1:27:19] them do everything but because he knew
[1:27:22] what their decisions would be
[1:27:24] he knew what their choices would be
[1:27:26] he could give the foreknowledge to go
[1:27:28] Jacob if I loved Esau have I hated
[1:27:33] brother Brandon said in the sermon
[1:27:35] by faith Moses he says by faith raise
[1:27:38] your eyes and look to him who said
[1:27:40] defile this body and I will destroy it
[1:27:42] by faith we believe those things it's
[1:27:45] nothing that you've seen it's something
[1:27:47] you believe by faith Moses did and in
[1:27:51] this Faith walk there Comes A Time there
[1:27:54] has to be a choice
[1:27:55] lot made that sad mistake when he that
[1:27:57] we make a lot of times we choose for our
[1:28:00] own good
[1:28:01] we choose things that would be better
[1:28:04] sometime if there's a little squabble
[1:28:06] comes in the church and someone would
[1:28:07] say well the Deacon or the pastor is on
[1:28:10] this side don't look at that look at
[1:28:12] what's righteous
[1:28:14] get that thing out and bring them both
[1:28:16] together that's Godly there's a choosing
[1:28:18] and if we choose for ourself we choose
[1:28:20] something that's for our own good but
[1:28:22] Moses chose the afflictions and the
[1:28:24] disgrace that he might walk with the
[1:28:26] people of God think of it now listen to
[1:28:27] it chose the afflictions of the people
[1:28:29] of God and counted it a great treasure
[1:28:31] for he endured seeing him who was
[1:28:34] invisibly
[1:28:37] but the window read this scripture
[1:28:39] earlier this morning Hebrews chapter 11
[1:28:41] starting at verse 24.
[1:28:44] by faith Moses when he had come to years
[1:28:46] refused to be called the son of
[1:28:48] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:28:50] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[1:28:51] than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a
[1:28:53] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:28:56] greater riches than the treasures in
[1:28:58] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[1:29:00] recompense of the reward by faith he
[1:29:02] forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of
[1:29:04] the king for he endured as seeing him
[1:29:07] who is invisible
[1:29:17] Esau had made the same kind of choice
[1:29:19] that brother Brandon describes in that
[1:29:20] quote he says a lot of times we choose
[1:29:23] for our own good
[1:29:24] we choose what we think is best we
[1:29:26] choose what will feel best we choose
[1:29:29] what we think is going to be best for us
[1:29:31] in the moment
[1:29:32] brother random described a lot as making
[1:29:34] that same Choice Abraham tells him pick
[1:29:37] the land where you go I'll go the other
[1:29:39] direction if you go right I'll go left
[1:29:40] if you go forward I'll go backward
[1:29:44] South North whatever you pick and so lot
[1:29:47] picked the fertile region to go there's
[1:29:51] everything here this is where I'll be
[1:29:53] able to be wealthy be comfortable that's
[1:29:56] where I'm going
[1:29:58] he focused on what would physically make
[1:30:02] him the happiest would make him be able
[1:30:05] to enjoy it the most
[1:30:08] and yet here we have Moses
[1:30:11] that makes the opposite choice
[1:30:13] Moses had everything his brother Wendell
[1:30:16] described this morning he had it all he
[1:30:19] had the silver spoon in his mouth he was
[1:30:21] next in line to Pharaoh all he had to do
[1:30:23] was be patient Pharaoh dies he takes
[1:30:26] over
[1:30:27] and I can free the slaves and still have
[1:30:29] everything
[1:30:32] that seems like the Easy Choice
[1:30:35] because now I get to free the slaves and
[1:30:37] I get to enjoy the wealth
[1:30:39] there's no downside here
[1:30:42] sept that it wouldn't be serving God
[1:30:46] it wouldn't be doing it the way God
[1:30:48] wanted it done
[1:30:50] and so
[1:30:52] Moses was willing to
[1:30:55] forsake it all
[1:30:58] he was rather to suffer Affliction with
[1:31:01] the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:31:03] pleasures of sin for a season
[1:31:06] he made the choice
[1:31:09] that it was better
[1:31:11] to be with the people of God
[1:31:13] like I said from an outside if I was
[1:31:15] just to present this as okay what would
[1:31:19] be the logical game plan of how you
[1:31:21] would handle this
[1:31:23] waiting 15 20 years
[1:31:26] for pharaoh to die
[1:31:28] and then I have it all and I can free
[1:31:30] the slaves because they're mine to free
[1:31:35] seems like the better choice
[1:31:37] if we were putting this out just as here
[1:31:39] this is the business you're going to
[1:31:41] develop you're second in line to the the
[1:31:43] owner
[1:31:45] now he doesn't treat his employees well
[1:31:47] he yells and cusses a lot
[1:31:50] he treats everybody like dirt but if you
[1:31:52] just hold on
[1:31:54] it'll be yours and then you can treat
[1:31:56] the employees well
[1:31:58] you can do this you can do that
[1:32:03] to put it in modern day terms we're
[1:32:05] throwing this out here it's like you
[1:32:06] just have to hold on you know don't
[1:32:08] don't Buck the the boss too much you
[1:32:10] know probably shouldn't correct him when
[1:32:12] he's cursing
[1:32:13] you know if he's really laying into
[1:32:14] somebody probably shouldn't get in
[1:32:15] between them
[1:32:17] but if you just lay low
[1:32:19] until he retires or dies the business is
[1:32:21] yours
[1:32:26] but yet Moses was willing to make the
[1:32:28] choice to go hey I'm willing to be fired
[1:32:31] in the modern terms
[1:32:33] to go no we can't do this we can't treat
[1:32:37] our employees this way we can't do this
[1:32:39] we can't do that I'm willing to stand up
[1:32:42] to the boss
[1:32:43] and be fired
[1:32:45] Moses was willing
[1:32:47] to throw in with God's people and be
[1:32:51] banished from the land and lose
[1:32:53] everything
[1:32:55] because he esteemed it Greater
[1:32:58] he esteemed it better
[1:33:02] to be with the people of God
[1:33:04] that was the choice he made
[1:33:07] and ultimately if we go back that was
[1:33:09] the choice that Jacob was making
[1:33:12] Jay was going the reason I want the
[1:33:13] birthright is because God chose this
[1:33:16] line
[1:33:16] if I'm at the Forefront of that he made
[1:33:19] Abraham This Promise
[1:33:21] so if I have the birthright I become
[1:33:23] part of that promise
[1:33:24] because I'm now part of that seed going
[1:33:27] down I'm part of that direct seed line
[1:33:31] as long as Esau has the birthright he's
[1:33:33] part of that
[1:33:35] I'm off to the side but I want to be
[1:33:37] right there at the Forefront I want to
[1:33:39] be the one
[1:33:40] who's getting this promise
[1:33:43] because I'm sure they had heard passed
[1:33:45] down from Dad about what grandpa had
[1:33:48] received as a promise from God
[1:33:50] they had heard this story
[1:33:52] but Esau didn't put the value on it he
[1:33:55] made the choice of
[1:33:57] I want to build up my own I want to have
[1:33:59] my own enjoyment and just
[1:34:01] become rich on my own and show what a
[1:34:03] powerful man I am and all Jacob wanted
[1:34:06] was I want to be part of that
[1:34:08] what Abraham was looking towards I want
[1:34:10] to be part of that line I want to be
[1:34:13] part of that promise
[1:34:14] and so that Birthright is everything
[1:34:18] that's what I'm looking for that's what
[1:34:20] I want to be part of
[1:34:25] John chapter 8.
[1:34:42] John chapter 8.
[1:34:46] and we're starting at the beginning of
[1:34:47] the chapter here it's
[1:34:50] Jesus went into the Mount of Olives went
[1:34:52] unto the Mount of Olives and early in
[1:34:53] the morning he came again into the
[1:34:54] temple and all the people came unto him
[1:34:57] and he sat down and taught them
[1:34:59] and the scribes and Pharisees brought on
[1:35:01] him a woman taken in adultery and when
[1:35:03] they had set her in the midst they say
[1:35:04] unto him Master this woman has taken an
[1:35:06] adultery in the very act now Moses and
[1:35:09] the law commanded us that such should be
[1:35:11] stoned but what sayest thou
[1:35:16] I'm going to pause a second
[1:35:18] Leviticus chapter 20.
[1:35:21] and verse 10.
[1:35:22] you don't need to turn there if Sister
[1:35:24] Keys just wants to put it up for
[1:35:25] everybody because we're going right back
[1:35:26] to John but Leviticus chapter 20 and
[1:35:28] verse 10.
[1:35:29] and the man that committeth adultery
[1:35:31] with another man's wife even he that
[1:35:33] committeth adultery with his neighbor's
[1:35:34] wife the adulterer and the adulteress
[1:35:36] shall surely be put to death
[1:35:39] now back to John chapter 8
[1:35:44] verse five again
[1:35:46] now Moses and the law commanded us that
[1:35:47] such should be stoned but what sayest
[1:35:50] thou
[1:35:51] this they said tempting him that they
[1:35:53] might have to accuse him
[1:35:55] but Jesus stooped down and with his
[1:35:57] finger wrote on the ground as though he
[1:35:58] heard them not
[1:36:00] all right
[1:36:02] the scribes and the Pharisees brought
[1:36:04] this woman
[1:36:06] first problem we have these are men that
[1:36:07] are students of the scripture
[1:36:09] these are men that
[1:36:11] I don't know which sect it was but at
[1:36:14] least one of them they were supposed to
[1:36:15] be able to have a scroll rolled up close
[1:36:18] put a pin through it and then name every
[1:36:20] word that the pin struck
[1:36:23] they should know the word that well
[1:36:26] you can't tell me they didn't know the
[1:36:29] entire commandment of Moses
[1:36:32] that it was the man and the woman should
[1:36:35] be stoned
[1:36:37] but yet somehow only the woman here ends
[1:36:41] up here in front of Jesus
[1:36:43] where's the guy they said they caught
[1:36:45] her in the very Act
[1:36:48] so there were two people involved they
[1:36:50] caught him
[1:36:51] they only brought her
[1:36:55] now
[1:36:57] I don't know
[1:36:58] what This Woman's story is
[1:37:01] brother Branham gave us more history
[1:37:03] about Rahab than what the scriptures say
[1:37:06] as a prophet he could tell us that
[1:37:08] I can't find anywhere where he gave us
[1:37:10] more history about this woman
[1:37:12] so I don't know if her story is anything
[1:37:14] like rahabs
[1:37:16] but I know that her life was a series of
[1:37:18] choices
[1:37:20] there were choices that kept being made
[1:37:22] throughout her life that brought her
[1:37:23] into this situation
[1:37:26] I'm sure there was mixture I'm sure she
[1:37:28] made good some good choices in life
[1:37:31] there was there wasn't I can't I'm not
[1:37:33] going to say that every single Choice
[1:37:35] she ever made was bad but obviously
[1:37:36] there were a lot of bad choices
[1:37:38] because she's now in this spot
[1:37:41] and somehow she made a choice
[1:37:44] that put her with a man
[1:37:46] that describes and the Pharisees didn't
[1:37:48] want to tangle with
[1:37:52] now we can try to Imagine This
[1:37:55] you know to me when I imagine it and I'm
[1:37:58] this is not in scripture so you all can
[1:38:00] throw this out if you want but my
[1:38:02] immediate thought is it was one of the
[1:38:04] scribes and Pharisees that was involved
[1:38:07] it's one of the guys and then
[1:38:10] this girl wanted him divorce his wife
[1:38:12] and be with her
[1:38:15] and he said that's not happening
[1:38:18] so I just need you killed and out of the
[1:38:19] way
[1:38:20] so this is how we're going to do it and
[1:38:22] while we're at it I'm going to take out
[1:38:24] Jesus as well
[1:38:26] I'm going to take we're gonna do two
[1:38:27] birds with one stone it's going to be
[1:38:29] great
[1:38:30] and so they bring the woman to Jesus
[1:38:33] to get a reaction
[1:38:35] they want something that they can work
[1:38:37] with
[1:38:39] throw the woman down in front of him
[1:38:42] and he
[1:38:43] promptly ignores them
[1:38:46] and it's just scribbling in the sand
[1:38:51] and they keep asking they keep pushing
[1:38:54] him and so finally
[1:38:57] he stands up
[1:38:59] he looks up at him and says
[1:39:02] whoever is without sin
[1:39:04] you throw the first stone
[1:39:06] and then he goes right back to drawing
[1:39:08] in the dirt
[1:39:12] he goes back to ignoring them
[1:39:14] you're not worth
[1:39:17] me paying attention to it's not going to
[1:39:19] help for me to listen to you yell
[1:39:21] it's not going to help for me to respond
[1:39:23] so all I'm going to do is tell you
[1:39:25] whoever's without sin throw the first
[1:39:27] stone
[1:39:29] and he goes down and he's drawing in the
[1:39:30] dirt
[1:39:32] and there are plenty of people that like
[1:39:34] to say well we think he was riding their
[1:39:36] sins out in the dirt maybe he was
[1:39:39] I can't tell you that because it's not
[1:39:41] in the Bible
[1:39:42] but he was God so he very easily could
[1:39:46] have been
[1:39:47] writing out every one of their sins in
[1:39:49] front of them
[1:39:50] oh yeah you've
[1:39:52] you've got a temper oh you're an
[1:39:54] adulterer oh you're a liar
[1:39:56] oh you're this you're that
[1:39:59] whether it was him riding it into the
[1:40:02] dirt
[1:40:03] or whether it was just conviction
[1:40:06] falling on them
[1:40:08] each one of them drops their Stone
[1:40:11] and walks away
[1:40:15] now I don't know what choices
[1:40:17] had brought this woman to this point
[1:40:20] but now she was at the same place where
[1:40:23] she now got to make a choice
[1:40:26] and so Jesus goes to her
[1:40:30] and he asks her
[1:40:32] where are your accusers
[1:40:35] who's condemned you
[1:40:37] and she says
[1:40:40] no man
[1:40:42] and Jesus looks at her
[1:40:45] and he says then neither do I condemn
[1:40:47] thee
[1:40:49] and this is where her choice comes in he
[1:40:51] says go and sin no more
[1:40:57] the same kind of way that we I talked
[1:40:58] about Rahab how she had never really had
[1:41:02] the man that she could trust and yet
[1:41:04] somehow she made the choice to trust
[1:41:07] these two men
[1:41:09] this woman is probably in a very similar
[1:41:11] place
[1:41:14] she's in the adultery position she's not
[1:41:17] the wonderful wife that a man was
[1:41:19] willing to fully commit to and do all
[1:41:21] these things she's the outcast she's the
[1:41:23] one everybody wants to kill
[1:41:25] and yet now here's this man
[1:41:30] who somehow has convinced everyone to
[1:41:32] leave
[1:41:35] whether she caught everything that he
[1:41:37] said in the midst of the yelling back
[1:41:39] and forth
[1:41:41] I don't know
[1:41:43] she may have been crying she may have
[1:41:45] been solving she may not have caught
[1:41:46] what he said she may not know what's
[1:41:48] going on
[1:41:50] except now they're gone
[1:41:54] and this man is looking at her and
[1:41:56] saying
[1:41:57] neither do I condemn you
[1:42:00] I don't look down upon you I don't think
[1:42:03] that you're anything less
[1:42:05] and I'm just going to tell you
[1:42:07] go and sin no more
[1:42:10] make the choice from this point to be
[1:42:13] different make the choice now to go
[1:42:16] forward in a different way
[1:42:18] make the choice to make a fresh start
[1:42:22] this was her moment to make her choice
[1:42:26] and the scripture doesn't tell us what
[1:42:28] she does
[1:42:30] we don't get to know
[1:42:34] but what we do know is she had an
[1:42:36] encounter with Jesus continuing to go
[1:42:37] through this process of sanctification
[1:42:39] we keep having these encounters with
[1:42:42] Christ
[1:42:44] and when we do we get to make that
[1:42:47] choice
[1:42:48] as brother Branham said in a quote that
[1:42:50] I read earlier you don't get to leave
[1:42:52] the same
[1:42:55] you either make the choice to leave
[1:42:58] better
[1:43:00] or you make the choice to reject and
[1:43:02] leave worse
[1:43:05] but it's still your choice
[1:43:08] if you reject it's harder the next time
[1:43:11] and I don't think that only applies to
[1:43:13] your salvation decision
[1:43:15] I think that applies to every single the
[1:43:18] ones you're struggling with if God's
[1:43:20] putting conviction on you for something
[1:43:22] and you pull away and walk out the doors
[1:43:25] rejecting it's going to be harder the
[1:43:27] next time
[1:43:29] it doesn't mean you can't overcome it
[1:43:31] doesn't mean that you'll still if you
[1:43:32] won't have a breakthrough down the road
[1:43:33] but it's going to be harder
[1:43:36] because you didn't respond and so you
[1:43:38] hardened that heart just a little bit
[1:43:42] now God can still get through
[1:43:44] and that's where I still apply this
[1:43:46] isn't just for that first decision of
[1:43:49] yes I accept Christ as my savior that's
[1:43:51] for every time that Christ comes down to
[1:43:53] meet you and go
[1:43:55] brother Wendell I want you to walk a
[1:43:57] little further with me
[1:43:58] I want you to take that next step I want
[1:44:00] you to go just a little bit deeper
[1:44:02] a little little more than we've had
[1:44:04] before
[1:44:09] the woman's Choice had brought her to
[1:44:10] this moment and she was surrounded by
[1:44:13] people that wanted to crucify her for
[1:44:15] her choices up to this point
[1:44:23] but Jesus was able to look past
[1:44:26] her old choices
[1:44:29] and give her a new choice
[1:44:33] that was what she was going to be
[1:44:35] evaluated on
[1:44:37] that's what he was putting out there as
[1:44:40] great you made lots of bad choices
[1:44:42] but here's your new option
[1:44:45] this is the choice
[1:44:47] that I'm going to care about
[1:44:50] this is the choice that matters
[1:44:53] and so when God brings us
[1:44:55] into those moments whether it's here in
[1:44:58] these Church walls whether it's at our
[1:45:00] own house whether it's off in the car
[1:45:04] and he brings us down to that moment and
[1:45:06] he's starting to minister to you and he
[1:45:08] gives you this choice
[1:45:10] he's telling us the same thing of those
[1:45:13] were your old choices
[1:45:16] but this is the choice that matters
[1:45:19] are you going to go a little bit further
[1:45:21] with me are you going to take those next
[1:45:23] steps
[1:45:25] or is it going to be harder or is it
[1:45:27] going to be more difficult are you going
[1:45:28] to make that choice
[1:45:31] but this is the decision that I'm
[1:45:33] focused on not your old stuff
[1:45:37] this one
[1:45:40] Matthew chapter 27
[1:45:43] and verse 38.
[1:45:49] then were there two thieves crucified
[1:45:51] with him
[1:45:52] one on the right hand and another on the
[1:45:55] left
[1:45:58] both of these thieves had made decisions
[1:46:00] and choices that led to this point
[1:46:04] they you know if you actually look
[1:46:06] through the history it's
[1:46:09] generally considered that these were not
[1:46:13] um
[1:46:14] gentle thieves
[1:46:16] these were not like the Robin Hood
[1:46:19] thieves that still from the rich give to
[1:46:21] the poor we're going to be nice about it
[1:46:23] we're going to do this these were
[1:46:25] violent criminals if you look at what
[1:46:28] historians say about it they're like
[1:46:29] these were
[1:46:32] thieves High women
[1:46:35] killers
[1:46:37] yes they were killing you to take your
[1:46:39] stuff they weren't just killing you to
[1:46:41] kill you but
[1:46:43] they weren't afraid of the violent side
[1:46:44] these were not let me make sure there's
[1:46:47] no one at home and then burgle the house
[1:46:49] because there's nobody here and it's
[1:46:50] safe this was
[1:46:52] I'm gonna get you on the road I'm gonna
[1:46:53] knock you over the head and if you die
[1:46:55] oh well at least I still got the money I
[1:46:58] came for
[1:46:59] these were these were these were Violent
[1:47:00] Men and both of them
[1:47:02] had made these decisions to bring them
[1:47:04] to this exact same point
[1:47:07] they had made very similar decisions
[1:47:09] along the way very similar choices
[1:47:13] to follow along this violent route and
[1:47:16] now they were both in the same position
[1:47:18] on either side of Jesus Christ on the
[1:47:21] crosses
[1:47:27] we don't know their exact stories
[1:47:30] and
[1:47:32] while I've heard it dramatized a few
[1:47:34] different ways where they try to give
[1:47:36] you full background of these thieves and
[1:47:38] how they ended up on the cross
[1:47:40] there's one thing
[1:47:42] that we can definitively say about these
[1:47:45] two
[1:47:46] one of these men
[1:47:48] had a heart that wasn't completely hard
[1:47:50] yet
[1:47:53] Luke chapter 23
[1:47:55] starting at verse 39
[1:47:57] and one of the male factors which were
[1:47:59] hanged railed on him saying if thou be
[1:48:01] Christ save thyself and us
[1:48:04] but the other answering rebuked him
[1:48:06] saying Dost not thou fear God seeking
[1:48:09] Thou Art in the same condemnation
[1:48:11] and we indeed justly for we receive the
[1:48:15] due reward of our Deeds but this man
[1:48:18] hath done nothing amiss
[1:48:21] and he said unto Jesus Lord
[1:48:24] remember me when thou comest into thy
[1:48:26] kingdom
[1:48:27] and Jesus said unto him verily I say
[1:48:29] unto thee today Thou shalt be with me in
[1:48:32] Paradise
[1:48:35] two men their previous decisions having
[1:48:38] brought them to the exact same point
[1:48:42] we're faced with one final choice
[1:48:45] what to do with the Man Called Jesus
[1:48:48] this is what it came down to this is
[1:48:50] what their entire lives as awful it has
[1:48:53] been as many crimes as they had
[1:48:54] committed as many
[1:48:56] lives as they had damaged
[1:48:59] it came down to this one final choice
[1:49:04] that outweighed everything else they had
[1:49:05] done
[1:49:07] what are you going to do with the man
[1:49:10] named Christ Jesus
[1:49:12] one man
[1:49:14] his heart fully hardened
[1:49:16] didn't care
[1:49:19] even in that moment
[1:49:21] all he could think about was let me
[1:49:24] spit at this person let me yell at them
[1:49:26] let me
[1:49:27] do anything to try to make it worse for
[1:49:30] this guy
[1:49:32] let me treat him
[1:49:35] as bad as I can
[1:49:38] one
[1:49:40] whose heart wasn't completely hardened
[1:49:44] and who obviously had heard about Jesus
[1:49:46] before
[1:49:47] because otherwise how could he sit there
[1:49:49] and go this man is innocent
[1:49:53] he had to have heard something about
[1:49:54] Jesus
[1:49:56] I don't know if he had ever been able to
[1:49:59] listen to Jesus teach I don't know if
[1:50:01] he'd ever been in that but at the very
[1:50:03] least had heard about him
[1:50:06] and he could in that moment
[1:50:09] sit there and go
[1:50:11] leave him alone you and I deserve this
[1:50:15] he doesn't
[1:50:17] he is innocent
[1:50:19] he shouldn't be here
[1:50:23] there was enough left in his heart
[1:50:27] as hard as it may have gotten there was
[1:50:29] still enough give in it for him to stand
[1:50:32] up and go this man doesn't deserve this
[1:50:34] he shouldn't be here
[1:50:37] you and I should be every choice we've
[1:50:39] made every decision has brought us both
[1:50:41] right here where we should be
[1:50:47] and then he could look at Jesus Christ
[1:50:49] and go Lord remember me he didn't ask to
[1:50:52] be saved
[1:50:53] he didn't say
[1:50:56] take us down off the cross prove
[1:50:58] anything he didn't ask for anything all
[1:51:02] he said was Lord remember me
[1:51:07] and when he said Lord remember me that
[1:51:10] was enough
[1:51:11] and that one choice of what do you do
[1:51:14] with Jesus
[1:51:15] this man was able to now suddenly Jesus
[1:51:18] looks at him and goes
[1:51:20] this day
[1:51:23] this day
[1:51:25] you'll be with me in Paradise
[1:51:29] all the evil you've done all that you've
[1:51:32] done wrong all your life all the
[1:51:34] violence that you've done
[1:51:36] you finally made the right choice
[1:51:39] and that choice outweighs all the rest
[1:51:43] that choice is the important one because
[1:51:45] now you made the right decision about
[1:51:48] what to do with Christ
[1:51:51] as Christians we've made that decision
[1:51:53] as Christians we sit here and we've made
[1:51:55] the decision about what we're going to
[1:51:57] do with Christ
[1:51:59] we've accepted him Lord wash us in your
[1:52:02] blood I want to follow you I want to
[1:52:04] serve you we surrender Our Lives to him
[1:52:08] but then we keep
[1:52:10] having to make choices over and over
[1:52:13] do we choose to actually
[1:52:16] follow his word completely
[1:52:18] or do we choose to go our own way in
[1:52:20] some ways
[1:52:22] do we continue to accept the blood of
[1:52:25] Christ for our sins or do we choose to
[1:52:28] think that the blood isn't strong enough
[1:52:30] because we should have known better
[1:52:34] I think this is one of the ones that
[1:52:36] Christians struggle with the most to go
[1:52:38] I should have known better I shouldn't
[1:52:40] have allowed that to happen
[1:52:41] I should have known better than to give
[1:52:43] into that Temptation or to be take part
[1:52:46] in this sin or to do this and then we
[1:52:48] want to sit there and go
[1:52:50] I knew better which means the blood
[1:52:52] can't do this
[1:52:56] that's the thought Satan wants to put in
[1:52:58] your mind you knew better
[1:53:00] you accepted Christ and then you still
[1:53:02] did this uh-uh blood's not good enough
[1:53:04] for that
[1:53:06] and then we have to sit there and make
[1:53:08] the choice of
[1:53:09] do we believe that
[1:53:11] or do we accept
[1:53:13] that his blood is strong enough for
[1:53:15] anything
[1:53:17] even when I make a mistake even when I
[1:53:19] come up short the blood is still there
[1:53:21] and it's still strong enough
[1:53:24] even for when I knew
[1:53:26] I shouldn't do that
[1:53:29] we have to choose which one we're going
[1:53:31] to accept
[1:53:33] do we choose to fully surrender to
[1:53:36] Christ
[1:53:37] or do we choose to keep a secret room in
[1:53:40] our heart that's hidden and off limits
[1:53:42] I'm not quite ready to surrender this
[1:53:44] yet
[1:53:45] I'm not quite ready to clean out that
[1:53:47] room this is where I like to to hide
[1:53:49] this part of my life or hide this
[1:53:52] addiction or hide this habit
[1:54:02] brother random tells a story in the
[1:54:03] sermon look
[1:54:06] he says
[1:54:08] one day A Mother's boy had killed a man
[1:54:11] he was laying there ready to die and so
[1:54:13] the little mother stood by the
[1:54:14] governor's door
[1:54:17] and finally with one of the guards
[1:54:18] Governor said
[1:54:20] Governor that the mother of that boy is
[1:54:21] out here wants wants you she wants to
[1:54:23] see you when they opened the door and
[1:54:25] said Madam he'll receive you the poor
[1:54:28] little thing crawled in on her hands and
[1:54:29] knees up to his feet
[1:54:31] laid her hands upon his feet and said
[1:54:33] governor
[1:54:34] honorable sir
[1:54:36] said you're the only man that's left
[1:54:37] that can spare my son
[1:54:40] please kind sir I know he's guilty
[1:54:42] he's just as guilty your courts of
[1:54:44] justice found him guilty
[1:54:47] and how many of us are not guilty in the
[1:54:49] courts of God
[1:54:51] your course of justice found him guilty
[1:54:53] he actually killed and he's subject to
[1:54:55] death I know that
[1:54:56] but sir as a man you have no right to
[1:54:59] take the life of my boy God only can
[1:55:01] give life and only God can take life
[1:55:03] don't do it sir please don't I beg of
[1:55:05] you a heart of a mother as a heart of a
[1:55:08] mother could bear and so he sent her
[1:55:10] away
[1:55:11] it broke his heart so much the pleading
[1:55:13] of that mother till he goes down to the
[1:55:15] jail to the prison where the boy was
[1:55:17] sitting back in the prison
[1:55:19] the man had built up a complex
[1:55:21] just about like the churches does today
[1:55:24] we'll either preach it the way I like it
[1:55:26] or I won't hear it at all
[1:55:28] I won't pay no attention
[1:55:31] wasn't set there man after man and come
[1:55:33] to him trying to talk to him
[1:55:34] he had built himself till he wasn't
[1:55:36] going to hear no more
[1:55:38] so the governor walked in he said Son
[1:55:40] I'd like to talk to you
[1:55:42] he said shut up and get out of here in
[1:55:44] his cell he said
[1:55:45] son I've come to help you said I told
[1:55:47] you to get out of here
[1:55:49] that's the way people does the Holy
[1:55:50] Spirit today yeah get out I don't want
[1:55:52] nothing to do with it knocks at the door
[1:55:54] if I do that I'll have to give up my
[1:55:56] card party I'll have to give this up
[1:55:58] I'll have to give that up I'll have to
[1:56:00] give up my church Creed I'll have to
[1:56:01] give
[1:56:02] see you better listen
[1:56:04] he's the only one who's got pardon
[1:56:06] that's right what are you looking at see
[1:56:07] he had looked so many things he was
[1:56:09] afraid to look at this man
[1:56:12] he kept his head turned
[1:56:16] that's the way people do today at the
[1:56:17] altar call
[1:56:18] they keep their head turned they don't
[1:56:20] want to hear it they turn their head
[1:56:22] from God who was telling them that's the
[1:56:23] truth
[1:56:24] a little weave voice like a touch
[1:56:27] you know Elijah he heard the rushing
[1:56:28] wind Blood Fire smoke and it didn't
[1:56:30] bother him but when he heard that little
[1:56:32] voice he come out
[1:56:34] oh that little voice the church has
[1:56:35] failed to hear
[1:56:37] so the man tried his best the governor
[1:56:39] tried to talk to the boy the boy said
[1:56:40] are you gonna get out of here or am I
[1:56:42] going to throw you out
[1:56:43] turned around and said all right son
[1:56:44] I've done the best I could do
[1:56:48] when the he walked out the boy looked
[1:56:50] around kind of arrogant as he walked
[1:56:51] down through the hall when he did one of
[1:56:53] the guards stepped up and said Governor
[1:56:55] did you do any good he said no he
[1:56:57] wouldn't listen
[1:56:59] that boy jumped he grabbed the bar said
[1:57:01] who was that
[1:57:03] that was the governor come for your
[1:57:04] pardon
[1:57:05] too late then he screamed he cried he
[1:57:08] said think of it the governor here in my
[1:57:10] own cell to pardon me and I turned him
[1:57:12] down
[1:57:13] and when they put the Rope around his
[1:57:15] neck before they put the black mask on
[1:57:17] after he'd walked the 13 steps last
[1:57:19] words he said think of it
[1:57:21] the governor stood in my cell for
[1:57:23] pardoning
[1:57:24] and I turned him down
[1:57:27] and they hung him
[1:57:29] oh there's more than a governor here
[1:57:31] this morning
[1:57:32] Jesus Christ is here and that little
[1:57:34] cell called man or woman he is here to
[1:57:37] give pardon
[1:57:38] don't turn him away don't do it
[1:57:40] find your purpose that God brought you
[1:57:42] here in life
[1:57:53] the random tells a similar story in the
[1:57:55] sermon hear ye him he says
[1:57:58] I feel like this is the one that we
[1:57:59] probably all know a little bit better
[1:58:01] the sermon hearing him he says I believe
[1:58:03] it was in the days of Abraham Lincoln
[1:58:05] when a soldier had committed a crime and
[1:58:07] he was up for execution
[1:58:09] he was going to be shot before a firing
[1:58:11] squad
[1:58:12] and some good friend went to the great
[1:58:14] Mr Lincoln which was an outstanding
[1:58:16] Christian he fell on his knees and he
[1:58:17] said Mr Lincoln they're going to take
[1:58:19] the life of a man
[1:58:21] just one word from you will pardon the
[1:58:23] man he he may be guilty of doing
[1:58:25] something the ought not have done in
[1:58:27] military service but I know him he
[1:58:29] didn't mean to do it won't you pardon
[1:58:30] him Mr Lincoln
[1:58:32] and being in a rush he just picked up a
[1:58:34] piece of paper and said pardon so and so
[1:58:37] Abraham Lincoln
[1:58:38] the man bowed politely to him rushed
[1:58:41] back to the cell and said my friend you
[1:58:43] are free I've got your part in here from
[1:58:45] Abraham Lincoln the president of this
[1:58:47] great United States here is a signature
[1:58:49] and the man that was in prison said why
[1:58:52] do you haunt me why do you make fun of
[1:58:54] me knowing I'm to die in the morning by
[1:58:56] firing Scott and bring such a piece of
[1:58:58] paper as that to me and try to make me
[1:59:00] believe that that's Mr Lincoln's name
[1:59:02] that he signed it said I I ought to be
[1:59:05] decorated up it ought to have a seal on
[1:59:06] it
[1:59:07] but he was in such a hurry any man knows
[1:59:10] Mr Lincoln will recognize the signature
[1:59:13] but he rejected it
[1:59:15] and the next morning he died by a firing
[1:59:17] squad he had the news of he was free but
[1:59:20] he wouldn't accept it
[1:59:22] then that was tried in a federal court
[1:59:24] and here was the verdict of the federal
[1:59:26] court here was Abraham Lincoln's name
[1:59:28] the president of the United States
[1:59:30] signed that this man was free and should
[1:59:31] not die by firing Scott and yet he died
[1:59:34] by a firing squad now what here was
[1:59:36] their verdict a pardon is not a pardon
[1:59:39] unless it be received as a pardon
[1:59:41] hear ye him it's a challenge it's a
[1:59:44] command it's a pardon it's all that you
[1:59:46] have need of if you'll just accept it
[1:59:48] that way but if you do not accept it
[1:59:50] that way
[1:59:51] it's just another piece of paper
[1:59:59] over and over again we face
[2:00:02] our choices
[2:00:03] and yes I know these stories are meant
[2:00:06] to be more focused on are you going to
[2:00:09] accept Christ as your savior
[2:00:11] these were the stories that you put out
[2:00:13] there to go this is your this is your
[2:00:14] opportunity to accept that pardon
[2:00:17] and those of us here we
[2:00:19] and those of us that are streaming
[2:00:22] have accepted that pardon we've accepted
[2:00:25] Christ as our savior but yet time and
[2:00:27] time again we have more choices to make
[2:00:29] and it's the same kind of place where it
[2:00:31] comes down to of you make the choice and
[2:00:34] here
[2:00:36] is the governor or here is Abraham
[2:00:39] Lincoln
[2:00:40] or here is God
[2:00:42] going I can help you overcome with this
[2:00:44] I can over help you I can help you deal
[2:00:47] with this I can help you handle this
[2:00:49] situation I'm trying to clean up your
[2:00:52] life
[2:00:53] I'm trying to help you take that next
[2:00:55] step
[2:00:56] and we have the choice
[2:00:59] to either accept
[2:01:01] or reject
[2:01:03] on each time
[2:01:05] Choice after choice
[2:01:08] after choice
[2:01:11] we get to make that decision time and
[2:01:13] time again
[2:01:19] but there's one other story
[2:01:22] the brother random told
[2:01:24] and as far as I could find
[2:01:27] when I was going through I could only
[2:01:28] find one sermon
[2:01:30] that he ever told the story in
[2:01:35] in the story of the message of Grace
[2:01:39] brother Branham said
[2:01:41] God's grace is like this let me tell you
[2:01:43] a story and ending
[2:01:45] God's grace is like this one time there
[2:01:47] was a mighty king
[2:01:49] and this mighty king had a son and it
[2:01:50] was his only son
[2:01:52] and one day a murderer killed that boy
[2:01:55] and through that Kingdom with the
[2:01:57] delegates hunting for that murderer and
[2:01:59] they finally found that murder and when
[2:02:00] they found them they brought him back
[2:02:02] and imprisoned him and when they did a
[2:02:04] trial was sent and a sentence was made
[2:02:06] oh it was a terrible thing he had
[2:02:08] murdered the King's son and he known
[2:02:10] what was coming to him
[2:02:12] they put them into the inner cells they
[2:02:13] locked the doors they put pads on it so
[2:02:16] no one the guards around it because we
[2:02:18] know what kind of horrible punishment
[2:02:19] this boy was going to receive because he
[2:02:21] killed the King's son the Royal King's
[2:02:23] son
[2:02:24] guards was placed all around the doors
[2:02:25] he was put in Inner Cell stripped with
[2:02:27] nothing on but a loincloth there he was
[2:02:29] set there in that condition
[2:02:32] starving wouldn't give him nothing to
[2:02:34] eat he was sitting in that condition
[2:02:37] they brought him out to a trial he was
[2:02:39] found guilty and proven guilty a
[2:02:41] sentence was made that he was to be
[2:02:42] executed under horrible capital
[2:02:44] punishment he would be killed by inches
[2:02:46] until his mortal life was gone sentenced
[2:02:49] by the judge he was to die and he begged
[2:02:51] and he cried he said though I'm guilty
[2:02:53] though I'm guilty I'm sorry that I did
[2:02:54] it I wish I'd never done it I'm sorry I
[2:02:57] did it in that moment in a rage of
[2:02:58] temper I did it and I didn't mean to do
[2:03:00] it that way
[2:03:02] one day the king went down to the place
[2:03:04] to visit the boy
[2:03:06] to tell him to talk to him to tell him
[2:03:07] about killing his own son the only son
[2:03:10] he had
[2:03:11] he had killed that boy said I'm going
[2:03:12] down to talk to him
[2:03:14] and when he went down there he looked
[2:03:15] back in that cage like a caged in animal
[2:03:18] he saw this little skinny body laying
[2:03:20] there in a corner crying his face all
[2:03:22] sunk in his joists saying Jaws sank back
[2:03:25] his eyes way back matter was all in his
[2:03:27] eyes his mouth was all Whited over no
[2:03:29] water thirsty laying back there on his
[2:03:31] face crying the king said stand up
[2:03:35] he come up to him and he looked at him
[2:03:36] he said why did you kill my son
[2:03:39] what did my son do to you what did he do
[2:03:41] to Merit such a death as you killed him
[2:03:43] stabbing him to death with a spear
[2:03:46] he said nothing my Lord
[2:03:48] not one thing just my own impudence just
[2:03:51] my own ways I killed him because I was
[2:03:53] jealous of him and I got in a temper fit
[2:03:56] and I killed him
[2:03:57] said now I'm to die unto your Justice
[2:03:59] sir I realized that and I deserve to do
[2:04:02] it
[2:04:02] only thing I'm crying for that I'm just
[2:04:04] sorry that I killed that Royal man like
[2:04:06] that Without a Cause
[2:04:09] the king turned on his heels and walked
[2:04:11] out went out to the deck
[2:04:12] and said destroy all the records
[2:04:16] you know put them in the sea of
[2:04:18] forgetfulness
[2:04:19] destroy all the records wash them up
[2:04:21] clean them up I'll send down a rope for
[2:04:23] him
[2:04:24] after a while great big limousine drove
[2:04:26] up to the door when it did a carpet was
[2:04:27] spread out to the prison cell the king
[2:04:29] stood at the end of the limousine said
[2:04:31] come my son and ride home with me to the
[2:04:33] Palace put the king's robe around his
[2:04:35] shoulder he said from henceforce you are
[2:04:37] my son
[2:04:39] because he had pity that's Grace that
[2:04:41] was me that was you we killed the Son of
[2:04:43] God with our sins we were aliens dirty
[2:04:45] filthy laying in the cells of the world
[2:04:47] God washed Us by the blood of his own
[2:04:49] son and cleansed us put on the robe of
[2:04:51] the Holy Spirit and now the great
[2:04:52] Chariot of God will back up to the door
[2:04:54] someday and we'll go home to live with
[2:04:56] him all records are destroyed we can't
[2:04:59] be judged no more
[2:05:01] the musicians will come
[2:05:06] but random told these stories of these
[2:05:08] men that couldn't accept their pardon
[2:05:11] they couldn't accept it because
[2:05:14] of how it was delivered they couldn't
[2:05:15] accept it because of how it was said
[2:05:17] they couldn't accept it because of how
[2:05:19] it looked they couldn't accept it
[2:05:20] because of
[2:05:21] reason after reason after reason
[2:05:25] but then this story
[2:05:29] it wasn't rejected
[2:05:34] he was given the pardon
[2:05:37] and he accepted it
[2:05:40] the same as the two thieves on the cross
[2:05:42] that were brought to the same point and
[2:05:44] had the same choice to make
[2:05:46] is demonstrated by these same stories
[2:05:48] these are in prison
[2:05:51] sentenced to die
[2:05:54] and they have their choice
[2:05:57] do they accept the way of Escape
[2:06:01] or do they refuse it
[2:06:06] and every one of our in our lives we
[2:06:08] have that choice to make with our
[2:06:10] salvation
[2:06:12] and then we have that choice to make
[2:06:14] over and over again as Satan tries to
[2:06:17] put us behind bars of Oppression or
[2:06:21] depression or
[2:06:24] lust or
[2:06:27] temper or
[2:06:30] this or that
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:34] over and over again we're given that
[2:06:36] same choice of can we accept the pardon
[2:06:40] can we accept that as dirty and filthy
[2:06:46] and wretched as we may look in that cell
[2:06:49] that God is still willing to take us and
[2:06:52] clean us up
[2:06:54] and have Us beside him as his son
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:07:00] or as his bride
[2:07:02] that he's willing to take that choice
[2:07:07] three prison cells
[2:07:09] three choices
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:13] two of them still ended up going to
[2:07:15] death
[2:07:16] one of them
[2:07:18] was elevated to the place of sun
[2:07:23] in who is this in 1959 brother random
[2:07:26] says when the Holy Ghost come today
[2:07:28] it brings the same decision
[2:07:30] each one of us are responsible for our
[2:07:32] decision we must make it it's here by us
[2:07:35] it's here with us
[2:07:36] there's no way around it anymore there's
[2:07:38] nothing we can do about it we have to
[2:07:40] reject it or receive it
[2:07:42] the same life that was in Christ Jesus
[2:07:44] is in the church today is performing the
[2:07:46] same works it's doing the same Miracles
[2:07:48] it's doing everything he did it's
[2:07:50] Healing The Sick raising the dead
[2:07:52] cleansing the lepers casting out Devils
[2:07:54] preaching the gospel the poor is
[2:07:57] receiving it
[2:07:58] blessed is he who is not offended go
[2:08:01] show John he said these things that are
[2:08:03] done John and the prison as eagle eyes
[2:08:05] had filmed over
[2:08:07] his prophetic eye couldn't see like it
[2:08:09] once seen
[2:08:10] but then he could see it when he said
[2:08:11] the lame walk the blind sea the deaf
[2:08:13] here and blessed is he is not offended
[2:08:15] in what I do
[2:08:16] if I do not the works of my father then
[2:08:18] believe me Dot
[2:08:20] if I do the works of my father if you
[2:08:22] can't believe me
[2:08:23] believe the works
[2:08:25] now that was his message
[2:08:27] that's what he said that it must be done
[2:08:30] that's what we've got to do is to make a
[2:08:32] decision
[2:08:34] what will we do with it it's here
[2:08:36] who is it what is it it's a promise of
[2:08:39] God by his word that he would do it
[2:08:43] God promised he would do it
[2:08:45] and we see it being done now it's up to
[2:08:47] us to make a decision will we serve
[2:08:49] will we understand
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:57] brother Wendell talked about the anchor
[2:08:59] this morning
[2:09:04] and when that storm
[2:09:06] is really going
[2:09:09] if you're not a trained sailor
[2:09:12] it can get tempting to cut the anchor
[2:09:16] because it feels like those waves keep
[2:09:18] going up and the anchor only lets you go
[2:09:20] up so far
[2:09:22] and it feels like well wouldn't we be
[2:09:24] better
[2:09:26] to go ahead and cut anchor and go with
[2:09:28] the flow a little bit more
[2:09:29] wouldn't that keep us safer
[2:09:32] but the trained Sailors will look at you
[2:09:33] go that's not a choice
[2:09:37] that anchor stays because as long as the
[2:09:39] anchor is locked in
[2:09:41] no matter how hard the storm goes no how
[2:09:44] matter how bad it may be
[2:09:47] we're still safe
[2:09:51] because the anchor is still holding us
[2:09:52] it's still holding us where we're
[2:09:54] supposed to be at
[2:09:56] [Music]
[2:09:58] the waves crashing all around the waves
[2:10:01] crashing over the sides of the boat
[2:10:03] doing all these things and an untrained
[2:10:06] eyes going
[2:10:07] let's cut the anchor let's we want to be
[2:10:10] on top of the Waves I don't want the
[2:10:11] waves going over top of us this isn't
[2:10:13] this isn't good
[2:10:15] and the sailors are going no
[2:10:19] that's that's what we want to stay right
[2:10:21] here
[2:10:22] we don't want to go anywhere
[2:10:27] throughout our lives we have choices
[2:10:30] some of them the most simple
[2:10:32] some of them the hardest we'll ever face
[2:10:37] we've made that first choice
[2:10:39] Lord I accept you as my savior
[2:10:42] Lord I want to serve you Lord I pray
[2:10:44] that you would wash me in my sins I pray
[2:10:46] that you would cleanse me
[2:10:48] I pray that you would give me the Fresh
[2:10:49] Start
[2:10:51] but throughout our walk
[2:10:53] the choices come
[2:10:55] and you have to keep
[2:10:58] making those decisions
[2:11:00] you have to keep deciding
[2:11:03] what am I going to do
[2:11:05] [Music]
[2:11:06] with the man named Christ
[2:11:09] that's what it comes down to
[2:11:13] can I trust him
[2:11:14] can I trust his word
[2:11:18] can I trust
[2:11:19] the present word for this day
[2:11:23] people keep cutting anchor all around us
[2:11:26] and going no brother Brandon wasn't a
[2:11:28] prophet I can't accept what he said
[2:11:31] and you watch the storms of life below
[2:11:33] them away
[2:11:35] because they cut their anchor
[2:11:37] they cut the line
[2:11:40] they made the choice
[2:11:45] and Satan wants to get you to that point
[2:11:49] but we have to keep making the choice go
[2:11:51] no I trust
[2:11:52] in where I've anchored
[2:11:55] I trust that if God anchored me here
[2:11:57] this is where I'm supposed to stay
[2:11:59] I trust that if this is what God has
[2:12:01] called me to do

[2:13:59] God
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:10] let's go ahead and pray
[2:14:13] [Music]
[2:14:14] Lord Jesus
[2:14:15] [Music]
[2:14:19] Lord I know this was just a simple
[2:14:21] thought Lord
[2:14:25] it wasn't anything
[2:14:27] new or earth-shattering lawn but
[2:14:30] Lord maybe just a a reminder of it
[2:14:36] that we have to keep choosing Lord have
[2:14:39] to keep choosing to surrender to you
[2:14:41] Lord we have to keep choosing to
[2:14:44] crucify this flesh we have to keep
[2:14:46] choosing to
[2:14:49] to feed the white dog and not the black
[2:14:51] dog
[2:14:53] Lord I pray that you would help us to
[2:14:58] turn those choices into habits Lord
[2:15:03] to make it where it's so normal for us
[2:15:06] to surrender to your leading lord it's
[2:15:08] so normal for us to
[2:15:11] surrender to your will
[2:15:13] that we do it without thinking Lord
[2:15:15] because
[2:15:16] it's no longer us doing the thinking but
[2:15:19] it's the very mind of Christ within us
[2:15:26] we're present this evening
[2:15:29] we just thank you for everything you do
[2:15:34] we love you
[2:15:35] [Music]
[2:15:42] please
[2:15:47] [Music]
[2:15:51] be it is willingness
[2:15:58] to be lost in his presence
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:11] or could we all sing it again
[2:16:15] oh I just wanna please
[2:16:20] foreign
[2:16:22] [Music]
[2:16:54] found in his likeness
[2:16:59] [Music]
[2:17:00] someday
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:09] praise the Lord
[2:17:14] so we've got
[2:17:19] we've got those choices and it's life
[2:17:22] and death it's good and evil it's
[2:17:26] it's not really a it's not the uh
[2:17:31] well it's a good idea or a bad idea
[2:17:36] Christ in his word is the only idea
[2:17:39] it's the only choice and if we don't
[2:17:42] choose that word
[2:17:44] there is nothing but death
[2:17:47] and so
[2:17:50] I think
[2:17:51] um brother Bradham made this statement
[2:17:53] he said
[2:17:55] full obedience to God's word entitles
[2:17:59] you to the Token entitles you to the
[2:18:03] Holy Ghost so
[2:18:06] we want to make sure when we talk about
[2:18:08] you know you know can't lose your
[2:18:11] salvation you got to make sure you have
[2:18:13] your salvation
[2:18:15] and if you get the baptism of the Holy
[2:18:17] Ghost it's his Spirit within you that's
[2:18:19] leading you and guiding you you were
[2:18:22] sealed and it's your desire to do the
[2:18:26] will of the lord it's your absolute
[2:18:29] desire sometimes we fail
[2:18:32] and we have to repent we have to as our
[2:18:36] brother was saying tonight we have to
[2:18:37] suffer the consequences
[2:18:40] but when the desire has been placed
[2:18:42] there by the Holy Spirit
[2:18:45] amen you can stand there
[2:18:47] and we can say it's our hearts desire
[2:18:49] our heart is ripped out
[2:18:54] because Rebellion can't be in the heart
[2:18:56] of a of a born-again believer
[2:19:00] there's no way Rebellion can be in the
[2:19:02] heart
[2:19:03] of a of a of a born-again believer
[2:19:06] because the Holy Spirit has come and
[2:19:08] arrested you he's taking you
[2:19:11] um
[2:19:12] he's taken your heart
[2:19:14] and he's living in it now he's guiding
[2:19:17] it
[2:19:18] do you make your mistakes yes but not
[2:19:21] willfully
[2:19:22] do you fail yes but not willfully the
[2:19:26] heart of rebellion is gone you see what
[2:19:28] I'm saying so our heart should always be
[2:19:33] Lord I want to please you
[2:19:36] and I want to tell you
[2:19:38] well I have a choice I have a choice
[2:19:41] where I can I maybe I don't want to obey
[2:19:44] the word of the Lord I'm saved
[2:19:46] and my salvation is secured once saved
[2:19:49] always saved so I can make any choice I
[2:19:51] want yeah yeah it might I want to tell
[2:19:54] you
[2:19:55] you walk away from the thing of God and
[2:19:59] contrary to the word of God you will
[2:20:02] suffer hell
[2:20:03] you will go through hell in your life if
[2:20:09] you walk away from the from the
[2:20:12] Commandment of the lord it's not it's
[2:20:15] it's not something for us to say it's an
[2:20:17] option
[2:20:18] there's no other option though we take
[2:20:22] the option
[2:20:23] oh God
[2:20:25] help us
[2:20:26] help us to walk with you I think I think
[2:20:29] there was a lot of good things said
[2:20:31] tonight
[2:20:32] amen and I I I I think about that
[2:20:38] about that about that boy
[2:20:41] [Music]
[2:20:43] you know the governor in the office
[2:20:45] there or in the cell
[2:20:47] amen
[2:20:49] and I you know
[2:20:52] I don't want his presence to be among us
[2:20:54] like this and and and have a have a
[2:20:57] wonderful wonderful services like this
[2:21:00] and then and then we turn him down and
[2:21:02] say well but I've got my own ideas about
[2:21:04] things I've got my own ideas about
[2:21:07] scriptures I've got my own ideas about
[2:21:09] well friends listen
[2:21:12] if our any idea is against what the
[2:21:16] prophet has brought to us of Malachi 4.
[2:21:20] Brothers let us choose you have to
[2:21:24] choose it now God's not going to make
[2:21:26] you do it but if you're a born-again
[2:21:28] Believer you're going to do it
[2:21:31] is that right
[2:21:32] it's going to be your desire to do it
[2:21:36] man
[2:21:37] now
[2:21:38] so how how can uh how can a woman keep
[2:21:43] wearing makeup and lipstick and
