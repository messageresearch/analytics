[10:30] gave his heart to the Lord cuz we've
[10:32] been watching him and everywhere he told
[10:35] my Aunt by marriage where I was I was
[10:38] doing the wrong thing so they were that
[10:41] close to getting me and and I would have
[10:45] had I would have went to PR I mean I
[10:46] wouldn't good God if there was anything
[10:48] good to me jaline it's because of him if
[10:51] I do anything good it's CA of him all
[10:53] the glory and uh thankful that I had a
[10:57] Christian parents that uh
[11:00] my dad prayed for me many
[11:02] years and his death is what woke me up
[11:05] all right God use that
[11:08] brother I mean I went to many I'm sorry
[11:11] I don't mean I wasn't going to but if I
[11:13] went to many funerals friends got
[11:15] killing car wrecks my grandpa's
[11:17] different ones and I'd walk go down the
[11:19] road quarter a mile I wanted to change I
[11:22] knew but I just didn't have the strength
[11:25] I couldn't I tried I think the longest I
[11:27] ever went was three days
[11:30] straight and uh young people's not worth
[11:33] it serve I wished I would have served
[11:35] God at a young age I wish I would have
[11:37] started and made many mistakes along the
[11:40] way but I was thinking you know I'm glad
[11:42] for God's keeping
[11:44] power there's times I fa God and I
[11:47] thought I shouldn't get back up what's
[11:50] people think about me now you know it
[11:52] didn't didn't the devil's pouncing on
[11:54] you
[11:55] too but uh by the grace of God I got
[11:58] back up
[12:00] grace of God I started serving the lord
[12:02] and kept going on and anyway I'll tell
[12:05] that to
[12:07] individuals got to go to a Jail recently
[12:10] and witness to some people any I'm glad
[12:13] whatever I can do for the Lord and
[12:17] anyway I'm sorry I was asked to say a
[12:19] prayer that's probably why they don't
[12:21] ask me up here brother Caleb I talk too
[12:23] much and the older I get I think I talk
[12:26] more brother Merl I used to be when I
[12:28] was quiet Indians I think it was brother
[12:31] Nathaniel's wife
[12:33] and is that what it is no too much maybe
[12:38] but they used to they said used to say
[12:40] the reason I didn't talk is because all
[12:42] I knew was churkey I wish that was true
[12:44] but I knew when they said come and
[12:47] eat there's about 100 grandkids running
[12:50] you better go eat amen I'm

[40:07] forsake us but thaty same Lord will be
[40:10] with us to the end of the world and I

[40:13] hold of and anchor it in our lives in
[40:15] our soul that he's the unchangeable God
[40:18] Amen you happen to be in the house of
[40:20] the Lord this
[40:24] morning amen if you have your Bibles
[40:27] let's open our scriptures to 2
[40:29] Corinthians
[40:30] [Music]
[40:36] 4:15 amen I believe we can come with an
[40:40] expectation to receive something from
[40:41] the Lord you know hearing brother Merl
[40:42] talk um I was listening to I think it
[40:45] was looking to the Unseen I believe and
[40:48] brother brandom he talks about how when
[40:49] MAA got that ulcer and how they he
[40:52] grabbed her hand and the rations Came
[40:53] Upon her hand his hand and he says you
[40:56] know I've seen it on other people but it
[40:58] was different when it was my own family
[41:00] and that really struck me that it's
[41:03] different whenever you need something
[41:04] from God you know whenever he needed God
[41:07] to come and heal her it was a little
[41:08] different then it was different from
[41:10] praying for somebody you didn't know you
[41:12] beli God could do it but when it comes
[41:13] to your own family and I can say Lord
[41:15] I'm making my expectation personal this
[41:17] morning I need something from God Amen I
[41:20] trust that's your attitude this morning
[41:22] 2 Corinthians 4:15 for all things are
[41:26] for your sakes that the abundant grace
[41:29] might through the Thanksgiving of many
[41:31] re re redown to the glory of the Lord
[41:34] for which cause we faint not but though
[41:37] our outward man perish yet the inward
[41:39] man is renewed day by day for our light
[41:42] Affliction which is for but for a moment
[41:45] worketh for us as a a far more exceeding
[41:48] and eternal weight of Glory why we look
[41:51] not at the things which are seen But at
[41:53] the things which are not seen for the
[41:55] things which are seen are temp Al but
[41:58] the things which are not seen are
[41:59] Eternal amen are you grateful for that
[42:02] this morning can we bow our heads dear
[42:04] gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we
[42:06] love you Lord and we're we're thankful
[42:08] for your your mercy God and your your
[42:11] grace that you've given us in this in
[42:12] this day Lord we ask that you would be
[42:14] in this part of the service father we've
[42:16] sang songs Lord and we've did our best
[42:19] to create an atmosphere for you to feel
[42:21] welcome Lord God I feel I I pray that
[42:24] you would feel welcome today in this
[42:26] portion of the service God As I Lay
[42:28] myself into your hands I ask that you
[42:30] would speak to the needs speak to the
[42:31] hearts father Lord you can still change
[42:34] circumstances you can still heal the
[42:36] sick father we ask that you would move
[42:38] among us today we commit the service
[42:40] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name
[42:42] amen you may be seated this morning and
[42:45] just a simple subject I I would have and
[42:48] it would be stabilized by the Unseen and
[42:51] brother brandom and and I've been going
[42:53] through a lot of the messages brother
[42:54] Brandon preached and look way to Jesus
[42:56] looking to the Unseen look uh Look Away
[42:59] to Jesus so a lot of what I'm going to
[43:00] be ministering gone will be out of those
[43:02] tapes but look away to Jesus brother
[43:04] Brandon would say cuz we got a prayer
[43:06] line coming up and many are standing
[43:08] their rooms and around the walls and so
[43:10] forth and I know I know you it's very
[43:13] hard on you and and I stood many a time
[43:15] myself and I passed by a while ago
[43:18] bringing the wife down and I noticed the
[43:20] people around the doors and I thought
[43:22] who says the gospel still isn't the most
[43:24] attractive thing there is in the world
[43:27] World sure it is it attracts those who
[43:29] are interested in it those who are not
[43:32] interested of course they don't they it
[43:34] won't be but Jesus said if I be lifted
[43:36] up I would draw I'll be lifted up from
[43:39] the earth I would draw on men unto me
[43:42] how true this is and and I like how
[43:45] brother brandham says that who says the
[43:47] gospel still ain't the most attractive
[43:49] thing in the world and I believe that as
[43:51] a minister we have an incredible
[43:53] opportunity to point the people to the
[43:56] greatest attraction
[43:57] I believe when the minister gets up to
[43:59] preach we're not pointing to a gift or a
[44:01] personality or or or a vision so to
[44:04] speak but we're pointing them to the
[44:05] greatest attraction and that is Jesus
[44:08] Christ and I believe the reason you're
[44:10] attracted to the message is because
[44:12] you've recognize that this is something
[44:14] different you've recognized that this is
[44:16] more than just a word this is more than
[44:19] just a message but there's the
[44:20] superatural that backs it up you know
[44:23] brother Brandon would talk about the
[44:24] Rich Young Ruler and would say why
[44:27] didn't he go to the priests and ask for
[44:29] eternal life was because he knew they
[44:31] didn't have anything so he came to the
[44:34] one who did have something to give and I
[44:36] believe the reason this gospel is the
[44:39] most attractive thing there is is
[44:41] because it's different even the world
[44:43] can testify we might not be able to live
[44:46] it but still there's something different
[44:48] about the pony Church you know there's
[44:50] something different about and they have
[44:52] something that I don't have and I
[44:54] believe this message has brought the
[44:57] enen world into or the Unseen World to a
[45:00] visible where we can see it in reality
[45:02] where the supernatural has been brought
[45:04] into manifestation and God has chose
[45:07] preachers to spread this message and
[45:09] brother Brandon would say now God could
[45:12] have chose to preach the gospel by the
[45:14] Sun by the Moon by the Stars by the wind
[45:17] or by nature but he chose men to preach
[45:19] the gospel and that's where the voice of
[45:21] God will come from and you can judge the
[45:24] voice according to the word it expresses
[45:27] then you can see what kind of voice that
[45:30] you're listening to if it's contrary to
[45:32] the word don't listen to it but if it is
[45:35] the word of God then God is Duty bound
[45:38] to back the word up and vindicate it and
[45:40] make it the truth because he promised to
[45:43] do it so we're living in a great day
[45:45] these words of Christ expressed and I
[45:49] love that at the end of it these are the
[45:50] words of Christ expressed and how are
[45:53] they being expressed by a preacher so
[45:56] when a preacher gets up and preaches
[45:58] he's pointing you to the greatest
[46:00] attraction that the Unseen can be made
[46:03] visible in your life not just something
[46:06] we talk about but it's a reality
[46:08] pointing you to something that can
[46:10] change circumstances pointing you to
[46:12] something that can change marital
[46:14] problems pointing you to something that
[46:17] that that can change the the situation
[46:19] that you are in but it's been and God is
[46:22] Duty bound to back it up and I like how
[46:24] the Bible would put it in Mark 16 and 20
[46:27] and they went forth preaching everywhere
[46:30] the Lord working with them and
[46:31] confirming the word with signs following
[46:35] so all they had to do was preach the
[46:37] word and God would do the rest and that
[46:40] takes that that takes the pressure off
[46:42] of a Preacher to try to bring the
[46:44] results the Bible says they went and
[46:46] preached everywhere and the Lord went
[46:49] with them and confirmed the word with
[46:51] the signs and I believe if we can just
[46:53] preach the gospel preach the message
[46:56] then the Lord would back it up if
[46:58] somebody is attracted to it then God is
[47:01] Duty bound to bring forth the results
[47:04] you believe that this morning the
[47:06] disciples in the Bible Jesus would tell
[47:07] them take no note on what you will say
[47:10] but in the hour the Holy Spirit would
[47:12] give you inspiration and so when the
[47:14] word comes forth It's not the word of a
[47:17] man but I believe it's God coming and
[47:20] inspiring the word to bring forth
[47:22] results and I believe a true God
[47:24] preacher he digs into the message and he
[47:27] brings more than just sermons he brings
[47:29] more than just quotes and scriptures but
[47:32] I believe he's bringing the Unseen into
[47:34] a visible world uh just just bear with
[47:36] me a few minutes as I as I try to lay my
[47:39] Foundation like I said I I've been going
[47:41] through the messages look and and a lot
[47:43] of these things are from it and the
[47:45] Bible would say in in Acts 28:31
[47:48] preaching the kingdom of God and
[47:50] teaching those things which concern the
[47:52] Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence
[47:55] and so a man of God gets up with all
[47:58] confidence because it ain't him that
[48:00] he's preaching but he's preaching
[48:02] concerning Christ and I believe and this
[48:05] goes for anybody not just preachers
[48:07] before you can before you can testify of
[48:09] something you got to have confidence in
[48:12] what you're testifying of right brother
[48:15] Brandon would tell us whenever he was
[48:16] selling the lamps he he would go and he
[48:18] would have a different approach he would
[48:20] say here you take the lamp for a week or
[48:22] or whatever it was and if you like it
[48:25] you can buy it he was confident that the
[48:28] product would sell itself oh man I'm
[48:31] confident that this message will sell
[48:33] itself cuz it is the most attractive
[48:36] thing that is upon the Earth and it
[48:38] attracts those who are interested in it
[48:41] and I believe that whenever a preacher
[48:43] gets up and preaches he's preaching by a
[48:46] vision and this really and and brother
[48:48] Andrew Glover was preaching up at
[48:50] brother Jonathan here a couple weeks ago
[48:52] at their at their uh convention and this
[48:55] really stood out to me that when you
[48:57] don't see victory for yourself the
[48:59] preacher sees it for you and brings it
[49:02] in a way where you can see it and you
[49:04] see I've experienced that whenever I've
[49:06] been down I've been discouraged I've
[49:08] been low and can't feel like I can take
[49:10] another step and A God Called preacher
[49:13] gets up and he preaches the promises and
[49:16] all of a sudden what he's preaching you
[49:19] connect with and you start to realize
[49:21] well when I did not feel like I could go
[49:24] on the preacher brought in a attaction
[49:27] where I could see Victory and I believe
[49:30] when sometimes when you can't feel or
[49:32] see Victory the preacher gets up and he
[49:34] sees victory for you and he preaches
[49:37] over your circumstances he preaches over
[49:40] your trials he preaches over what you're
[49:43] going through and he lifts you up where
[49:45] you can see over the things that are
[49:48] bringing you down and can see victory
[49:51] for yourself oh when you don't feel like
[49:53] you're a Christian he brings the
[49:55] promises and something strikes that I
[49:57] can't help but make this Rapture even
[50:00] when I don't feel like it it's an
[50:02] attraction that is attracting you and
[50:05] bringing you to the promises of God oh
[50:09] my brother Brandon would say now Lord as
[50:11] I spoke tonight of David with the little
[50:13] slingshot he was interested in the
[50:16] father's sheep and no matter how little
[50:18] it was he was ready to display and to
[50:21] conquer with what little he had to
[50:24] conquer with and you was with him Lord I
[50:27] am coming after these sheep tonight
[50:29] they've been sick I've obeyed your
[50:31] Commandments you showed your presence
[50:33] your willingness you've healed them with
[50:36] cards without cards showing that you are
[50:39] here and you never fail you're the UN
[50:41] thepresent God and I'm coming to
[50:43] challenge the devil that would keep them
[50:46] behind the sound barrier of unbelief now
[50:49] that I prayed them through tonight I
[50:51] break the way with the word of God and
[50:54] set them free in the name of Jesus
[50:57] Christ I bring them back to Faith come
[50:59] out of Satan so how would he break away
[51:03] for the people to see Victory it was him
[51:06] preaching the gospel oh come on now and
[51:09] that's what a preacher does he gets up
[51:12] and when all you see is a stone wall
[51:14] when all you see is circumstances all
[51:17] you see is failures a gospel preacher
[51:20] gets up and he breaks away through the
[51:23] barrier so that you can step on the
[51:25] other side the trial and see victory for
[51:28] yourself oh Hallelujah and I'm going to
[51:31] stand as a little David and say I don't
[51:33] care what you're going through God is
[51:35] interested in you seeing Victory not
[51:37] just the preacher seeing Victory God
[51:39] wants you to see Victory he wants you to
[51:42] have joy he wants you to have peace and
[51:44] Little David said I don't care how
[51:46] little the Sheep is I am interested in
[51:49] them seeing Victory oh when the little
[51:52] sheep could not see Victory David seen
[51:54] victory for them oh you might not feel
[51:57] like you can overcome this morning but
[51:59] God sees victory for you you might not
[52:01] feel like you can take another step
[52:03] through depression but God sees victory
[52:05] for you and he sent the preacher this
[52:08] morning to let you know that I see
[52:10] victory for you as well and you can
[52:13] experience the attraction of Victory
[52:16] this morning oh Hallelujah I break the
[52:19] way with the word of God and set them
[52:21] free and what was he setting them free
[52:24] to come to back the faith and I think
[52:26] that is so incredible that brother
[52:28] Brandon would get up and he and he he he
[52:31] he would use Des arment he would use the
[52:33] the healing of the hand but the third
[52:35] pole was more than just a gift it was
[52:38] Christ right it was the word coming and
[52:40] letting the people know that I have come
[52:43] to the Earth to bring a deliverance and
[52:45] the Bible would tell us in Isaiah 61
[52:48] And1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[52:51] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[52:53] preach Good Tidings unto the me can he
[52:56] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[52:59] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[53:01] opening of the prison to them that are
[53:04] bound and it's incredible cuz brother
[53:06] Brandon would say if he Jesus was here
[53:09] in a Corporal body he could not heal you
[53:12] because he already healed you and he and
[53:14] I love how brother Brandon would say it
[53:15] he would say he didn't claim to be
[53:17] anything special he just preached the
[53:20] gospel oh ain't that incredible and the
[53:22] Bible says the Lord God hath anointed me
[53:25] to preach good Tidings so when the body
[53:28] of Jesus left the anointing didn't leave
[53:30] with him but the same anointing that
[53:33] anointed Jesus to see Victory and to
[53:36] preach Victory to the people is the same
[53:39] anointing that is here today proclaiming
[53:42] Liberty proclaiming Victory proclaiming
[53:45] joy and peace even when you don't see it
[53:49] yourself there's an anointing that says
[53:51] I break away by the word of God so that
[53:54] you can see victory for your yourself so
[53:57] you can see a Revival for yourself so
[53:59] you can see joy for yourself even when
[54:03] you don't see it for yourself there's an
[54:05] anointing that says it's for you
[54:08] Hallelujah there's anointing that says
[54:10] it's for you and it's a gospel preacher
[54:13] oh I love how brother Brandon puts it he
[54:15] could have anointed a rock to preach the
[54:17] gospel he could Anointed The Stars to
[54:19] preach the gospel but he anointed a
[54:21] preacher and it's the preaching of the
[54:23] word that breaks away for victory to
[54:26] come through oh my and I believe when
[54:28] God calls a message preacher and he gets
[54:31] behind the sacred desk he's seeing
[54:33] things for you and he's showing what you
[54:35] need to achieve victory for the Brandon
[54:38] would say you know evil things travel at
[54:40] night snakes and bugs all kinds of
[54:42] insects they fly at night because it's
[54:45] evil but let the sunrise and they take a
[54:48] dark place just as hard as they go why
[54:51] they are of the darkness they don't want
[54:54] the light that's the way the world is
[54:56] getting today it doesn't want the real
[54:59] the real true Gospel Light the real
[55:02] light of God shows a man's needs so
[55:05] whenever a gospel preacher gets up and
[55:07] he starts to preach the gospel he's
[55:09] letting you know what you need to
[55:11] achieve Victory and he starts to break
[55:13] away through the barriers of doubt he
[55:16] breaks the way through barriers of
[55:18] unbelief so that you can have faith to
[55:21] achieve your Victory you see and it's
[55:24] the true Gospel Light that has started
[55:26] starting to to break away and brother
[55:28] Brandon would tell us when Noah started
[55:30] to preach it was going to rain God had
[55:33] already showed him to build an ark so
[55:35] before he ever started to preach it is
[55:38] going to rain he had a way of Escape
[55:41] that he was seeing so whenever he would
[55:43] get up and preach he wasn't just
[55:45] pointing them to a canoe he wasn't
[55:48] pointing them to to to a little boat the
[55:51] denominational boat but he was pointing
[55:53] them to an unseen way of Escape you see
[55:57] the people couldn't see it at the time
[55:59] he wasn't built yet it would take a
[56:01] predestinated moment for them to get in
[56:04] that boat it took a 120 years and right
[56:07] now you might not see your rapture you
[56:09] might not see your body change but we're
[56:12] pointing you to Something in the Unseen
[56:14] realm that is going to be made visible
[56:18] oh so even though Noah's wife might not
[56:20] have seen the boats he didn't have the
[56:22] vision like Noah had but he was so
[56:25] convinced that this is the truth he
[56:27] would tell her and talk to her get us
[56:29] boys together and would say hey it's
[56:32] going to rain but God is given us a way
[56:35] of escape and I'm so and I just love
[56:38] when a preacher gets up and he gets so
[56:40] infused he gets so anointed and he
[56:43] starts to let you know that the promises
[56:46] of God are realities and whenever you
[56:49] can't see it you look at the anointing
[56:51] and say wow this is something that I can
[56:54] grasp even though I might not be able
[56:56] bble to see it there's an anointing that
[56:58] is pointing me to something of
[57:01] Deliverance oh hallelujah it's pointing
[57:04] me to something of Deliverance and
[57:06] brother Brandon would say this and when
[57:08] you hear the word it's usually somebody
[57:11] he was talking about look when you hear
[57:13] the word look it's usually somebody
[57:15] trying to get you to see what they are
[57:18] looking at and they say to you look
[57:21] going down the road you you someone
[57:23] might see a certain scene and they would
[57:25] say look and then Express what it is
[57:29] it's a mountain or a cactus whatever
[57:31] they're looking at but the first thing
[57:33] to get your attention is look and I love
[57:37] it he brother brandom says they say look
[57:39] they see a certain scene but you can't
[57:41] see it yet cuz you're looking in a
[57:43] different direction so what he would do
[57:46] is would say look and once he gets your
[57:48] attention then he starts to express what
[57:51] he sees oh Hallelujah and that's what a
[57:55] gospel preacher does he says look and
[57:58] then starts to express what inspiration
[58:01] has brought to him oh that's why we need
[58:03] inspirational preachers not just some
[58:05] theology that gets up in a dry sermon
[58:08] but we need inspiration to come and
[58:10] anoint preachers and point you to
[58:13] something that they see in the Unseen
[58:15] realm and say you can achieve it as well
[58:19] even though you don't see it there's
[58:20] Victory there's a cactus there's a
[58:22] mountain But first you got to look in
[58:24] the same direction that but I am looking
[58:27] then you can see it as well oh
[58:30] Hallelujah you got to get in the same
[58:31] thought pattern get in the same
[58:33] direction and when you get in that same
[58:35] channel then you can start to see what
[58:38] that person is seeing and I believe if
[58:40] we all get on the same channel that the
[58:42] prophet was in we can start seeing the
[58:45] supernatural not just the preacher not
[58:47] just the pastor not just the deacons but
[58:49] everybody can get in the same channel
[58:52] the same inspiration and look at the
[58:54] same promises and they're not just empty
[58:57] promises that that that we can achieve
[58:59] but we see them by understanding and
[59:02] realize that they are mine they are Y
[59:05] and
[59:06] amen oh Hallelujah you got to look at
[59:09] something and you're going to focus on
[59:11] something we're living in a day where
[59:13] you can look at anything right you can
[59:15] build your family around anything you
[59:17] can build your family around fear you
[59:20] can build your family around complexes
[59:22] you can build your family around an
[59:25] unstable or you can build your family
[59:28] upon the Unseen but the Brandon would
[59:30] say this where where if you look at with
[59:32] your eyes and you see now that a nation
[59:35] is shaking and trembling War clouds are
[59:38] flying everywhere every nation under is
[59:41] distressed and perplexion of time every
[59:43] sign that Jesus said would happen is
[59:46] happening there would be signs in the
[59:48] heavens above and in the earth below and
[59:50] great things that would be taking place
[59:53] like the flying saucers and Mystic
[59:55] things taking place but he commanded to
[59:58] to his church to lift up their heads in
[1:00:01] that day and to look up for the Unseen
[1:00:04] Christ will be appearing pretty soon so
[1:00:08] if we walked by only by sight we would
[1:00:10] be Children Of Darkness sure enough but
[1:00:13] I'm so glad to know there was a light
[1:00:15] that shines in every believer's Hearts
[1:00:18] so here brother brand he he's
[1:00:20] dramatizing it that we are seeing the
[1:00:22] things that Jesus spoke of but then he
[1:00:26] commanded the church not suggested but
[1:00:29] he commanded to look what are we looking
[1:00:32] at the Unseen his appearing oh
[1:00:36] Hallelujah brother the brand tell us
[1:00:37] there's a difference between the
[1:00:39] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[1:00:41] Christ right he says he's appeared now
[1:00:44] in the fullness of his power so Jesus
[1:00:47] would command the church to look for the
[1:00:50] Unseen is appearing oh Hallelujah so
[1:00:53] we're not just looking at a gift we're
[1:00:56] not just looking at prophecies we are
[1:00:58] looking at the Unseen that has made
[1:01:01] himself visible in this generation that
[1:01:04] you can build families upon you can
[1:01:07] build your marriage upon you can build
[1:01:09] and expect Revival for your teenagers
[1:01:12] expect Revival for your marriage we're
[1:01:15] looking at the Unseen that has been made
[1:01:17] visible in this generation oh Christ is
[1:01:21] now appearing in the fullness of his
[1:01:24] power we done it just your word we got
[1:01:26] the power with the word you see I don't
[1:01:28] want just a dead letter I want the power
[1:01:30] with it come on now I don't want just
[1:01:32] the theology I want something that can
[1:01:35] keep my mind when I'm going through
[1:01:37] depression I want something that can
[1:01:39] keep my marriage when we're having
[1:01:41] problems I want some power that would
[1:01:44] keep my teenager in the rebellious years
[1:01:47] don't just give me theology don't just
[1:01:49] give me quotes give me something that is
[1:01:51] stable that can stabilize me when I go
[1:01:54] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:01:56] death I feel something that is an anchor
[1:01:59] on the
[1:02:00] inside don't give me to some theology
[1:02:03] give me some Power give me some
[1:02:05] Authority with it oh Hallelujah brother
[1:02:08] the Brandon would preach a message
[1:02:09] called looking under Jesus and would say
[1:02:12] what do you see when you look oh so you
[1:02:15] look but what are you seeing but the
[1:02:17] Brandon would say the Bible says uh we
[1:02:19] don't we do not see all things but we do
[1:02:22] see Jesus that's who I want to see I
[1:02:25] want to see see him and how do I see him
[1:02:28] in the fulfilling of his promises oh we
[1:02:31] don't see all things but we do see Jesus
[1:02:35] Oh My let me be have that attitude I
[1:02:37] don't see all things but I do see one
[1:02:39] thing that is the Supreme one I see the
[1:02:42] authority that has come to the bride but
[1:02:45] you see what do you see when you look
[1:02:48] and I think it's so incredible that you
[1:02:50] got to catch what you're looking at cuz
[1:02:53] brother brandom says you look with your
[1:02:55] eyes but you see with your heart right
[1:02:58] and what does that mean to see with your
[1:03:00] heart it means to understand right cuz
[1:03:02] brother Brandon would tell us when
[1:03:04] Nicodemus come to Jesus and says what
[1:03:06] must I do right and he says You must be
[1:03:08] born again and he says unless you're
[1:03:11] born again you could not see the kingdom
[1:03:13] of God and brother Brandon would say the
[1:03:15] word see means to understand so you look
[1:03:18] with your eyes you look at the message
[1:03:21] but you got to go from just looking
[1:03:23] you've got to go to seeing which is to
[1:03:26] understand and that's how you get
[1:03:28] stabilized by the Unseen it's not
[1:03:30] looking at the word but getting an
[1:03:33] understanding that even though I go
[1:03:35] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:03:37] death by understanding I fear no evil ca
[1:03:41] the Unseen is walking with me oh you may
[1:03:44] feel like you're going through a drought
[1:03:46] this morning quit looking at the visible
[1:03:48] world and looking to the Unseen the
[1:03:51] promise if you seek me you will find me
[1:03:54] if you knock the door will be open you
[1:03:56] may say brother joshh I need a Revival
[1:03:58] look into the
[1:04:00] Unseen you may say I need healing for my
[1:04:02] body look into to the Unseen not empty
[1:04:06] promises but by understanding you
[1:04:08] realize that they are mine oh then you
[1:04:12] get on the same you get on the same
[1:04:13] channel with the preacher right that
[1:04:16] this ain't just no more sermons it's
[1:04:18] understanding that he's bringing to me
[1:04:21] oh if we ever get that Revelation that
[1:04:23] the preacher when he gets behind the
[1:04:25] desk it's it's more than just empty
[1:04:26] sermons but it's understanding bringing
[1:04:29] to you the Unseen oh that you can look
[1:04:32] and say wow that's what he's talking
[1:04:34] about that is understanding where I can
[1:04:37] see brother Brandon would say this here
[1:04:39] oh brother when you see the Gospel Light
[1:04:41] what difference does sickness death or
[1:04:44] anything else mean ain't that incredible
[1:04:47] when you see the Gospel Light not with
[1:04:50] eyes but understand so whenever you
[1:04:53] understand the Unseen what difference
[1:04:56] does the seen world mean I think that is
[1:04:59] so powerful that the reason many people
[1:05:01] is up and down up and down is because
[1:05:03] they're looking through natural eyes and
[1:05:05] natural circumstances natural problems
[1:05:08] natural chaos and they fail to see that
[1:05:11] in the Unseen there are some more
[1:05:13] promises that you can achieve oh
[1:05:16] Hallelujah cuz brother Brandon would
[1:05:18] tell us that people look at the word
[1:05:20] naturally but he says you're literally
[1:05:22] he says that's not the way you're
[1:05:23] supposed to look at it he says you look
[1:05:25] at it literally but then the word
[1:05:28] declares itself spiritually so we're not
[1:05:30] just supposed to look at letters
[1:05:32] naturally with eyes but we need to go
[1:05:35] beyond looking at it and understanding
[1:05:37] it cuz brother Brandon must say the word
[1:05:39] is a seed and he says it needs the Holy
[1:05:41] Ghost to water the seed so whenever you
[1:05:44] look at the word it plants the seed but
[1:05:47] you need an unseen Force to come and
[1:05:50] water the seed to make it live so it's
[1:05:53] more than just looking naturally we need
[1:05:55] the supernatural to come and make it
[1:06:00] live that's why we need more than just
[1:06:02] theology we need something to make the
[1:06:05] word live that's what the denominations
[1:06:08] have they've got theology right they've
[1:06:10] got word they got word word but where's
[1:06:12] the anointing to come and make it live
[1:06:15] right where's the supernatural that can
[1:06:17] take drug addicts and make them saints
[1:06:19] for God that can keep marriages together
[1:06:22] that's what this message has brought to
[1:06:24] you is not just word it's brought the
[1:06:27] mighty Angel it's brought the anointing
[1:06:30] to make the word
[1:06:32] live Hallelujah it is brought
[1:06:35] understanding where the Unseen is not
[1:06:37] just an imagination but it's a reality
[1:06:40] oh Hallelujah we don't see with their
[1:06:42] eyes we see with the heart and brother
[1:06:44] Brandon would tell us we are told that
[1:06:46] we have outward man and inward man and
[1:06:49] the outward man looks by his eyes the
[1:06:51] inward man walks by faith so we have to
[1:06:54] be led by one of these two persons
[1:06:57] outside outward man is inward man is God
[1:07:00] you see we do not see with her eyes
[1:07:03] though many times we thought we see with
[1:07:05] our eyes we only look with our eyes we
[1:07:08] see with our heart and he so he says
[1:07:11] we're going to be walking by one of
[1:07:13] these two people it's going to be the
[1:07:15] inward man or the outward man and he
[1:07:17] would say in another place that the God
[1:07:19] wants to lead man but he but there's a
[1:07:22] war that goes on between God and man
[1:07:25] because man is constantly looking at the
[1:07:28] things he can see and he says when you
[1:07:30] look at the things you can see your
[1:07:32] emotions or your control tower and I
[1:07:35] thought my that is so incredible we're
[1:07:37] living in a day where the emotions are
[1:07:39] up and down up and down up and down you
[1:07:42] wake up in the morning you don't feel
[1:07:43] like you're may you can make it
[1:07:45] depression is on the Rampage anxiety is
[1:07:48] on every teenager on every marriage
[1:07:50] we're living in a day where the emotions
[1:07:53] are controlling the people cuz they're
[1:07:55] walking by by the wrong SS they're
[1:07:58] walking by what they see and their
[1:08:00] emotions are controlling their salvation
[1:08:03] their emotions are controlling their
[1:08:06] Destiny but if you can change your sight
[1:08:08] from naturally to understanding your
[1:08:11] emotions may go up and down but you're
[1:08:15] stabilized by what you understand oh
[1:08:18] your emotions may tell you that you
[1:08:20] don't feel good and you you're going to
[1:08:22] go through depression you close the
[1:08:24] shades and go lay in bed and never see
[1:08:26] the sunlight again your emotions try to
[1:08:29] bring you down but the soul the inward
[1:08:32] man don't look and are controlled by the
[1:08:35] emotions they're controlled by the
[1:08:38] Unseen World oh that Soul it may go
[1:08:42] through hard times but it is stabilized
[1:08:45] by the Unseen oh man brother Brandon
[1:08:48] would tell us that God took man's heart
[1:08:50] which is led by faith and and the devil
[1:08:52] took man's head which is led by by
[1:08:55] emotions I'm not talking about no
[1:08:57] natural emotions by dancing or or
[1:08:59] speaking in tongues I'm talking about
[1:09:01] the inward emotions when you wake up in
[1:09:04] the morning and you don't feel like
[1:09:05] you're a Christian how many's ever been
[1:09:07] there you wake you go to bed feeling
[1:09:09] you're on cloud nine you feel like
[1:09:11] you're going to make a Rapture nothing
[1:09:13] can stop you but you wake up the next
[1:09:15] morning you don't even feel like you're
[1:09:16] saved it's emotions that is up and down
[1:09:20] up and down and if you're looking
[1:09:22] naturally those emotions will control
[1:09:24] you but if if you look at the right
[1:09:26] thing your emotions has no control over
[1:09:29] you you see but the it's easy sometimes
[1:09:32] to walk by emotions brother Brandon
[1:09:34] talks about Jonah and would say that
[1:09:37] that Jonah just won the city the size of
[1:09:40] St Louis you remember I'm talking about
[1:09:41] that he says Nineveh was the size of St
[1:09:44] Louis and he just W them to God right
[1:09:47] after that he walks up to a mountain and
[1:09:50] says God take my life what was it was
[1:09:53] emotions it was emotions and that that's
[1:09:55] what happens many times after a meeting
[1:09:58] after a good church service man you're
[1:10:00] in Revival but then you step out and all
[1:10:02] of a sudden here comes the emotions
[1:10:04] nobody loves you nobody likes you you're
[1:10:06] not going to make a Rapture but that's
[1:10:08] the time to be stabilized and see I
[1:10:11] don't care what the emotions say I got
[1:10:14] one one destination and that is what the
[1:10:17] Unseen has brought me oh brother Brandon
[1:10:20] would talk about Elijah and would say he
[1:10:22] would go through emotions youall
[1:10:24] remember that he says he he would go to
[1:10:26] Mount Carmel and he would call fire from
[1:10:28] heaven he would kill 450 priests to bail
[1:10:32] now he's running from a woman and he
[1:10:34] says Lord I'm the only one that is left
[1:10:36] of your profits just take my life his
[1:10:39] emotions were were were completely
[1:10:42] contrary to the reality of the Unseen
[1:10:45] cuz what would God say God would say
[1:10:47] I've got
[1:10:49] 7,000 oh I'm preaching now I've got
[1:10:51] 7,000 his emotions were pointing him
[1:10:55] away from the reality that Jehovah was
[1:10:58] seeing and God's got promises for you
[1:11:01] but your emotions will push you away
[1:11:04] from those promises where you're saying
[1:11:06] I can't make a Rapture I can't make a
[1:11:08] Rapture and here God is saying I've got
[1:11:10] a Rapture for you oh would you notice
[1:11:13] what would change Elijah's eyesight was
[1:11:16] an angel oh and I love here would come
[1:11:18] an angel and would starts to rub his
[1:11:20] shoulders and you know what that angel
[1:11:22] would do the Bible says he gave him
[1:11:24] strong me e to eat so even though his
[1:11:28] emotions was preaching contrary here
[1:11:31] come an angel with the message that can
[1:11:33] say I don't care what the emotions are
[1:11:35] telling you that is not the truth and
[1:11:38] we've had an angel with the message in
[1:11:40] this generation that has brought strong
[1:11:43] meat and has let you know it don't
[1:11:45] matter what your emotions say that is
[1:11:48] not the reality of the Unseen oh
[1:11:52] Hallelujah your emotions might be
[1:11:54] telling you that you're teenager is
[1:11:56] never going to be saved but that's a lie
[1:11:58] from the pits of hell and there are some
[1:12:00] strong meat letting you know this
[1:12:02] morning that look into the Unseen you
[1:12:05] will see the
[1:12:08] realities hallelujah oh the outward man
[1:12:11] is trying to lead you by your emotions
[1:12:14] which makes you unstable so he needed
[1:12:16] something to bring a stability and
[1:12:18] brother Brandon would say this and
[1:12:21] Christ revealed in his own word he says
[1:12:23] now in my text this morning is is Christ
[1:12:26] revealed in his own word now where I
[1:12:28] come to the conclusion to talk on this
[1:12:31] was because that knowing we mustn't say
[1:12:34] we mustn't say uh just say because we're
[1:12:37] gathered together just halfheartedly to
[1:12:39] speak on something but it's something
[1:12:42] that will stabilize the people for we
[1:12:45] are going to pass through dangerous and
[1:12:48] treacherous Waters we are already
[1:12:50] sailing through them and sometimes I
[1:12:52] guess it's with you like it is with me
[1:12:55] and so here's a prophet letting you know
[1:12:58] those same Troubled Waters that you
[1:13:00] going through he went through and that
[1:13:03] incredible he says I guess it is with
[1:13:05] you like it is with me that it seems
[1:13:08] like that so much of it it just gets
[1:13:10] scary so here stands a prophet letting
[1:13:13] you know that the visible world the
[1:13:16] treacherous Waters you're going through
[1:13:18] all a scary thing and it's because it
[1:13:22] was a scary thing he says I'm not just
[1:13:24] coming halfheartedly just to preach you
[1:13:27] something but I'm bringing something to
[1:13:30] stabilize you and what was he preaching
[1:13:32] Christ revealed in his own word and then
[1:13:34] whenever I read that man I that did my
[1:13:36] heart so good what was he doing he was
[1:13:38] revealing the unseen to bring
[1:13:42] stability even in the treacherous Waters
[1:13:45] that you go through Christ has been
[1:13:47] revealed the Unseen has been revealed
[1:13:50] that even though you go through scary
[1:13:52] times you can be stabilized oh even when
[1:13:55] you go through hard times you can BR you
[1:13:58] can be stabilized it was the unveiling
[1:14:00] of God bringing the Unseen to be visible
[1:14:04] brother Brandon would say this were the
[1:14:05] last days the last hours of the days do
[1:14:08] you seek him now in his word and all of
[1:14:11] his word made manifest right before us
[1:14:14] oh Church of the Living God get to your
[1:14:16] feet and believe him with all that is in
[1:14:19] you hold to that little wheel at the the
[1:14:22] the wheel in the middle of the wheel let
[1:14:24] it stabilize every move every motion
[1:14:28] that you will make every thought that
[1:14:30] you have may it be controlled by the
[1:14:33] tower that is inside of you because God
[1:14:35] is setting right in his word of this
[1:14:38] hour in the evening light showing forth
[1:14:41] is light he says stay get stabilized by
[1:14:44] what God is doing and what is he doing
[1:14:47] God is setting in his word letting you
[1:14:49] know that he's unveiling himself he's
[1:14:52] revealing the unseen and it's so
[1:14:54] incredible that if you can never get a
[1:14:56] glimpse of the Unseen it brings a St it
[1:14:59] stabilizes you right you
[1:15:01] know Austin if I told you that I got you
[1:15:04] a new drum set back from the office it's
[1:15:07] great in things but there's a door
[1:15:08] that's closed right you don't know what
[1:15:11] there I could be just speaking of
[1:15:12] something you
[1:15:14] know I'm going to I'm just going to hope
[1:15:16] this is okay brother Joe brother Joe was
[1:15:18] talking about how he's going to he's
[1:15:20] smoking some meat and how he's going to
[1:15:21] get a business going and Austin says are
[1:15:23] you just a dreamer or is this really
[1:15:25] going to happen you know right now it's
[1:15:27] dreams he thinks it's a dream but once
[1:15:30] he starts to bring it into motion and
[1:15:32] enails this plan it goes from more than
[1:15:35] a dream to realization and you see God
[1:15:38] has been unveiled or been veiled up in
[1:15:41] our imaginations oh yeah he's a million
[1:15:43] miles away he's this he's that but in
[1:15:45] this generation God has brought his
[1:15:48] plans into manifestation where it's more
[1:15:51] than just dreams it's more than just a
[1:15:53] Million Miles Away but it's been brought
[1:15:56] into reality and now that can stabilize
[1:15:59] every question oh it stabilizes every
[1:16:02] doubt it stabilizes every negative
[1:16:05] thought that comes against you you see
[1:16:08] you I remember I talked on a I talked on
[1:16:10] uh the the Chariots of Fire last time I
[1:16:13] preached but Al brother brand and put
[1:16:15] him he says because Elijah was used to
[1:16:18] walking by faith he was looking at the
[1:16:21] Unseen all the time and he knew that God
[1:16:24] had said in the Psalms the angels of God
[1:16:27] are encamped about those who fear Him
[1:16:31] that was enough for Elijah but brother
[1:16:33] Bram is putting it that Elijah didn't
[1:16:36] even see the Angels oh hope you're
[1:16:38] hearing me now he didn't even see them
[1:16:41] but understanding told him it was there
[1:16:45] oh so visibly in the seen world he could
[1:16:48] not see Victory but he knew victory was
[1:16:51] already there and you might not see it
[1:16:53] this morning but victory is already here
[1:16:56] if you can just understand it that the
[1:16:58] word promised that he would be with you
[1:17:02] no matter what you go through in the
[1:17:04] scen realm in The Invisible World God is
[1:17:08] there every step of the way the
[1:17:10] stabilizing something oh could you
[1:17:13] imagine the young boy walking into the
[1:17:15] tent saying Elijah were surrounded and
[1:17:18] he stops and he says more are with us
[1:17:20] than with them there was a question mark
[1:17:23] it was an empty promise it was something
[1:17:25] in the imagination but as soon as the
[1:17:28] prophet would say open this Poor Boy's
[1:17:30] eyes what happened his eyes would come
[1:17:32] open to the Unseen realm and it was
[1:17:35] still invisible to the
[1:17:37] syrians right the syrians couldn't see
[1:17:40] it but this boy by understanding could
[1:17:43] see that the promise that the word spoke
[1:17:46] of was it was in manifestation even
[1:17:49] though nobody else can see it oh the
[1:17:51] world might not see the Rapture the
[1:17:53] world might not even see but there's a
[1:17:55] sound of mind but you see it the devil's
[1:17:58] coming against you hounding your mind
[1:18:00] hounding your body but you can look into
[1:18:02] the Unseen and you can see that this is
[1:18:05] a reality and what I love about about
[1:18:08] that in Psalms 34:7 the angel of the
[1:18:10] Lord encampeth around about them that
[1:18:13] fear Him and
[1:18:17] deliverthat angels that was there but he
[1:18:20] knew they was going to deliver him oh
[1:18:23] you see we don't just got empty promises
[1:18:26] there's Authority behind the promises
[1:18:29] that brings it into action he knew if
[1:18:33] the Angels were there they they were
[1:18:35] going to deliver him from every snare
[1:18:38] that the syrians could put in front of
[1:18:40] him and oh my we didn't just get Christ
[1:18:43] as an onlooking angel we got somebody a
[1:18:46] person in this generation that has
[1:18:48] brought his authority he brought his
[1:18:51] power to let you know that no matter
[1:18:54] what you go through I will bring you
[1:18:56] through it you may go through mind
[1:18:58] battles but I'll bring you through it
[1:19:00] you may go through back pain but I'll
[1:19:02] bring you through it Hallelujah who
[1:19:06] Hallelujah brother Brandon would say
[1:19:08] this where two or three are gathered
[1:19:10] together in his name there he is in
[1:19:12] their midst not only in the midst as a
[1:19:15] complacent onlooker or as a recording
[1:19:18] Angel but there he stands expressing
[1:19:21] exactly what he is the life and
[1:19:23] sustainer and so he's saying here stands
[1:19:26] Christ he's he's talking about
[1:19:27] Revelations how he was standing in the
[1:19:29] midst of the golden candlesticks and
[1:19:32] brother brand says we don't need to look
[1:19:34] back and wish we was there because
[1:19:36] Christ is here and he says he's not here
[1:19:38] as a complacent onlooker or as a
[1:19:41] recording Angel but he is here
[1:19:43] expressing he's expressing himself he's
[1:19:46] expressing himself as the peace in the
[1:19:48] valley he's expressing himself as the
[1:19:51] sound of mind he's expressing himself as
[1:19:54] all of these attributes that was in the
[1:19:56] mind of God now he's expressing itself
[1:19:59] brother Brandon would say this when a
[1:20:00] man once catches the vision of the
[1:20:03] unvisible god and know that he's always
[1:20:06] present there's something that
[1:20:08] stabilizes the man's thinking it
[1:20:11] stabilizes his actions and in the times
[1:20:13] of distress and trouble it'll still make
[1:20:16] him look upward above the things oh man
[1:20:19] this is powerful friends above the
[1:20:21] things that are happening around him
[1:20:24] because he's looking at the Unseen how
[1:20:26] is he looking by the Unseen he says he's
[1:20:29] looking at the Unseen yet by promise oh
[1:20:32] he's looking out a promise instead of
[1:20:35] the troubles brother brandom says if a
[1:20:37] man ever catches a vision of the
[1:20:39] unvisible it stabilizes his actions it
[1:20:43] stabilizes his thinking now that's where
[1:20:45] the Battleground is right the greatest
[1:20:47] battle is ever fought is right in the
[1:20:49] mind that's where the devil's coming
[1:20:52] that's where emotions flare up and he
[1:20:53] says it's stay stabilizes the man's
[1:20:56] thinking so the Battle Ground that the
[1:20:58] Devil Comes against God stabilizes it
[1:21:02] and even though he's going through
[1:21:04] troubles he looks above the troubles to
[1:21:07] the Unseen by a promise oh when I read
[1:21:11] that friends man that did did me so good
[1:21:13] that here he is you know David would say
[1:21:16] that he would he would bring forth a
[1:21:17] table in the presence of his enemy was
[1:21:20] God bringing a table no he was letting
[1:21:22] him know that he is with me if in the
[1:21:24] time of trouble in the time of natural
[1:21:28] enemies oh Hallelujah in the time of
[1:21:31] natural enemies he was looking to the
[1:21:33] Unseen saying I have Fellowship even in
[1:21:36] the midst of natural circumstances I'm
[1:21:39] still having fellowship with the Unseen
[1:21:43] even though you go through natural hard
[1:21:45] times you're still having Fellowship in
[1:21:48] the
[1:21:49] Unseen oh Hallelujah you're still having
[1:21:53] Fellowship you're still get strength
[1:21:55] you're still marching gone every step of
[1:21:57] the way naturally you don't see it but
[1:22:01] understanding says it's here oh brother
[1:22:03] Brandon would say if the Unseen one will
[1:22:06] declare himself visible then it ought to
[1:22:08] make your soul past every barrier your
[1:22:11] soul he didn't say nothing about your
[1:22:13] mind he says your soul cuz remember your
[1:22:16] soul is your soul is saved but your mind
[1:22:19] is never saved right you still battle
[1:22:21] contrary thoughts concerning the word
[1:22:24] you still have lustful thoughts you got
[1:22:26] to battle but he so he didn't say your
[1:22:28] mind he says your soul he says if your
[1:22:31] soul could ever get a glimpse of the
[1:22:33] Unseen it makes it go past every barrier
[1:22:36] and if your soul could ever get
[1:22:38] stabilized then it stabilizes your
[1:22:41] thinking it stabilizes your actions come
[1:22:44] on now you know I've quoted them many
[1:22:45] times but but the brandom says many
[1:22:47] people say that the devil made me do it
[1:22:50] he says no the devil didn't make you do
[1:22:52] it you just never was born again right
[1:22:54] cuz says if you're born again the only
[1:22:56] way the devil can get to you is to
[1:22:58] repent be baptized and receive the Holy
[1:22:59] Ghost and then he's your brother right
[1:23:02] if you're soul is ever secured and
[1:23:04] stabilized it stabilizes your actions it
[1:23:08] stabilizes your thinking it stabilizes
[1:23:10] you're speaking even when negative
[1:23:12] thoughts arise you're stabilized and you
[1:23:15] say no that's contrary to the word of
[1:23:18] God oh Hallelujah don't allow your
[1:23:22] emotions to try to control your soul
[1:23:24] don't allow your emotions even when your
[1:23:26] soul is secured emotions are still going
[1:23:29] to pop up right emotions is still going
[1:23:32] to try to bring down in your soul but
[1:23:34] don't listen to the emotions hope this
[1:23:36] is okay this morning don't listen to
[1:23:38] those things but go past every barrier
[1:23:41] with the soul that's what this message
[1:23:44] is after is your soul right it's not
[1:23:47] after your mind your mind's never saved
[1:23:49] but if the message could ever go from
[1:23:50] the mind to the soul then you're
[1:23:53] stabilized so if the the message if your
[1:23:55] soul could ever get past every barrier
[1:23:58] and start to SAR in this message oh the
[1:24:00] heights is open for you come on now the
[1:24:03] heights is Open Heavens is open up for
[1:24:05] you the Supernatural is opened up to you
[1:24:08] brother Brandon would say this and I'm
[1:24:09] told that who who fly these here these
[1:24:11] real fast jet planes and they say that
[1:24:14] the plane getting up to a certain speed
[1:24:16] that it vibrates and it shakes and it
[1:24:19] seems like the boats are going to fly
[1:24:21] out of him that the wings are going to
[1:24:23] come off and they they tell they pass
[1:24:25] the sound barrier but once they pass the
[1:24:28] sound barrier they say the plane just
[1:24:30] sells out just in ease when it passes
[1:24:33] the sound barrier that the obstacle that
[1:24:35] is in the way of the plane when it
[1:24:37] passes its own sound then it runs at
[1:24:40] ease I love that when it passes its own
[1:24:44] sound but before it passes its own sound
[1:24:48] it feel like it feels like the the the
[1:24:50] wings are going to fall off right he
[1:24:52] says it feels like the boats are going
[1:24:54] to fall off how come it's own sound it's
[1:24:57] pushing against it oh come on now that's
[1:24:59] where many Christians are they can't get
[1:25:02] past their own emotions they can't get
[1:25:04] past their own thinking they can't get
[1:25:06] past their own ideas and it feels like
[1:25:08] they can't make it that's why when you
[1:25:10] get up you man I can't make a Rapture
[1:25:12] cuz you're still hitting the barrier of
[1:25:15] your emotions but if you can ever get
[1:25:17] past that brother brandom says the plane
[1:25:20] runs at ease oh you see Christianity
[1:25:24] it's pretty easy once you get past the
[1:25:26] barriers then you run at ease when the
[1:25:29] devil says you're not going to make it
[1:25:31] you say oh no I'm already passed that
[1:25:33] when the devil says you're not good
[1:25:34] enough I'm already pass that when the
[1:25:36] devil says you know your past mistakes
[1:25:39] I'm already passed that I'm past my own
[1:25:42] barriers and I'm soaring in the heights
[1:25:45] of the Unseen I say little church rise
[1:25:48] above every barrier rise above every
[1:25:50] circumstance rise above every emotion
[1:25:53] and Sor am Heights of the Unseen and you
[1:25:56] can see that he's still Jehovah Gyra
[1:25:59] he's still the Lord that heals he's
[1:26:01] still the god that delivers he's still
[1:26:03] God Mighty in battle hallelujah it's the
[1:26:06] Unseen that has stabilized me has
[1:26:10] stabilize me even though I'm going
[1:26:12] through treacherous Waters I'm
[1:26:15] stabilized hallelujah oh we don't look
[1:26:18] at the scene cuz those things are
[1:26:20] temporal we look at the Unseen for those
[1:26:23] things are eternal
[1:26:27] oh Hallelujah brother Brandon M sayah oh
[1:26:30] if the Church of this day could ever
[1:26:32] pray till it passes the sin barrier and
[1:26:35] the unbelief barrier they could shout
[1:26:37] the victory of a living God and when
[1:26:40] they once passed the barrier how and he
[1:26:43] tells us how to pass the barrier if they
[1:26:45] once passed the barrier by looking to
[1:26:48] the Unseen and letting the world vibrate
[1:26:51] and do what it wants to do in other
[1:26:53] words we have no dealings with the world
[1:26:56] if if America's going to go down the
[1:26:58] tubes let her do it let them vibrate Let
[1:27:01] Them Fall Apart let that marriage fall
[1:27:03] apart but it's for me in my house let
[1:27:06] that one go down in unbelief let that
[1:27:08] one criticize the Unseen let that one
[1:27:11] say this the message is false let them
[1:27:13] vibrate but as for me I'm pass that
[1:27:16] barrier how by looking at the
[1:27:22] Unseen oh Hallelujah then you can shout
[1:27:25] the victory yes then you can shout the
[1:27:28] victory remember the Garment of Praise
[1:27:30] for the spirit of heaviness once your
[1:27:32] past your own sounds then you put on
[1:27:35] that garment what is that garment it's
[1:27:37] the Unseen then you realize that you're
[1:27:40] wrapped in the Unseen and there's no way
[1:27:42] the devil can get to your soul he can
[1:27:44] try to plag your emotions but he can't
[1:27:47] get to the soul you see brother brand
[1:27:49] would say this here if you if you if you
[1:27:51] look to the Blessed word that says Jesus
[1:27:54] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:27:56] forever and turn your heads towards that
[1:27:59] and press on until you pass the
[1:28:01] vibration past the unbelief barriers the
[1:28:04] sin barriers all the barriers that seem
[1:28:07] to hinder you then you'll fly free in
[1:28:10] the faith of God knowing that all things
[1:28:12] are possible and there's then they say
[1:28:14] there's no limits hardly to the speed
[1:28:17] that the plane will go if there's no
[1:28:19] limits to the speed that the plane will
[1:28:21] go there's no limits to the blessings
[1:28:23] that the God will pour upon the believer
[1:28:27] that will believe so if there's no
[1:28:29] limits to the to the speed and to the
[1:28:31] heights of a plane that gets past the
[1:28:34] barrier what about
[1:28:36] you come on brother Brandon will tell us
[1:28:38] there's untapped resources right there's
[1:28:40] no limits to the victories you can
[1:28:43] achieve you know brother Harry was
[1:28:44] telling me something about a Sunday
[1:28:46] school lesson about striking the ground
[1:28:48] you know here he only struck the ground
[1:28:50] three times and he he had unlimited
[1:28:52] victories unlim mited he had unlimited
[1:28:55] resources but he would only strike the
[1:28:57] ground three times and little church
[1:28:59] you've got unlimited resources you've
[1:29:02] got unlimited victories you got you got
[1:29:04] you got Heights for joy and for peace
[1:29:07] but if you can ever get past the
[1:29:09] barriers oh there there's no limits of
[1:29:11] the blessings of God that that that uh
[1:29:14] that will pour upon you no wonder the
[1:29:16] Apostle Paul could say oh death where is
[1:29:19] your sting oh grave where is your
[1:29:21] Victory and he then he points to
[1:29:23] something and just love it and he says
[1:29:25] but thanks be to God who give us the
[1:29:27] victory so he's pointing to the Unseen
[1:29:30] right thanks be to God the Unseen which
[1:29:33] give us the victory through Jesus Christ
[1:29:36] so what was Jesus it bridged the gap
[1:29:38] between the seen and the Unseen it was
[1:29:42] natural man but Supernatural God so here
[1:29:45] stood something that would bridge the
[1:29:48] gap between the the Unseen and the
[1:29:51] visible and even though Paul was going
[1:29:53] through Vis visible circumstances he
[1:29:56] would point to something tangible and
[1:29:59] would say this here has brought me the
[1:30:01] Victory and I believe this message has
[1:30:03] bridged the gap between the Unseen and
[1:30:06] the visible world that we can point to
[1:30:09] it and say this message is thus saith oh

[1:32:21] visible hallelujah oh oh Hallelujah it
[1:32:25] was job you know if anybody had a right
[1:32:29] to walk by emotions it was job right
[1:32:32] here job he was just living his everyday
[1:32:34] life man great life he had he had
[1:32:37] children he had a wife he had friends
[1:32:40] and brother Brandon would say everybody
[1:32:41] would come to him for Visions everybody
[1:32:44] he was a prophet so everybody would come
[1:32:46] to him everybody was his friend right if
[1:32:49] you have something that somebody wants
[1:32:51] man everybody's your friend and here on
[1:32:53] the time of trouble all of those friends
[1:32:55] he thought he had turned away his family
[1:32:58] his kids were taken away his Lively
[1:33:01] stalk was taken away his wife turned
[1:33:03] against him and yet here he stood
[1:33:06] stabilized he could he had every right
[1:33:08] to point and let the emotions rise up
[1:33:11] here come friends pointing to his
[1:33:13] emotions and he says no I'm not a secret
[1:33:16] Sinner and what is so incredible is what
[1:33:19] were these friends trying to do the
[1:33:21] friends were coming and saying he was a
[1:33:23] secret sinner right what what what would
[1:33:27] cover his sins the bloody sacrifice
[1:33:30] right so the very thing that stabilized
[1:33:34] job his friends were trying to get him
[1:33:37] to doubt have you ever thought of that
[1:33:39] before he he could sit there blameless
[1:33:42] because of the bloody sacrifice and here
[1:33:44] comes his friends saying you're a secret
[1:33:46] sinner but he knew he wasn't because of
[1:33:49] the sacrifice oh if the devil could ever
[1:33:51] get your emotions to get your so wacky
[1:33:55] and out of balance where you start to
[1:33:57] doubt the message and doubt the promises
[1:33:59] you're know you're going to sit there
[1:34:00] and you're going to fall into despair
[1:34:02] right you've got no hope outside of this
[1:34:04] message job had no hope outside of his
[1:34:08] sacrifice it was a sacrifice that gave
[1:34:10] him hope for his children right the
[1:34:13] Bible would tell us that he slay a
[1:34:15] sacrifice he slay a lamb for his
[1:34:17] children because they were at the party
[1:34:19] remember and he said pre-venture that
[1:34:21] they may sin he slay a land so this
[1:34:24] sacrifice was the only thing that was
[1:34:27] keeping hope for his children keeping
[1:34:30] hope for himself and this message is the
[1:34:33] only hope you got for your children it's
[1:34:35] the only hope that you got to see loved
[1:34:37] ones that went on the other side don't
[1:34:40] let the devil come and get you unstable
[1:34:43] on this message oh here job stood his
[1:34:47] emotions could have FL flared up but he
[1:34:50] says now he kept him in check and what's
[1:34:52] so incredible he was walking by faith
[1:34:55] and all of a sudden he heard Thunders
[1:34:58] right the Bible tell us the Thunders
[1:34:59] will begin to blare all the all
[1:35:02] everybody else just heard Thunders but
[1:35:04] job heard more than Thunders he heard a
[1:35:06] voice and man we got people associated
[1:35:09] with the message all they hear was
[1:35:10] Thunders they're trying to figure out
[1:35:12] what the Thunders are we heard a voice
[1:35:15] right we're not waiting for somebody to
[1:35:17] come and interpret the Thunders we
[1:35:19] already got the interpretations it was
[1:35:21] the voice it was the message and here
[1:35:23] the Thunder would begin to blare he
[1:35:25] didn't just hear thunder he heard a
[1:35:27] voice and what would that voice do it
[1:35:30] would pick him up and lift him into the
[1:35:33] Unseen World and what is so incredible
[1:35:36] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:35:38] blessed be the Holy Name he's walking by
[1:35:40] faith but all of a sudden his faith
[1:35:44] lifted him up and he looked and he says
[1:35:46] I know my redeemer liveth and at that
[1:35:49] day oh Hallelujah at that day in my
[1:35:52] flesh I'll see God
[1:35:54] so even though he was going through
[1:35:56] present conditions the invisible World
[1:35:59] lifted him above present conditions and
[1:36:02] showed him that in that flesh he's going
[1:36:04] to see God oh Hallelujah your present
[1:36:08] conditions have no strongholds strong
[1:36:11] enough to keep you from going in fact to
[1:36:14] the mind of God oh then what would job
[1:36:17] say I've heard but now I see I've been
[1:36:20] walking by faith but now I've got a
[1:36:23] glimpse of the unvisible God we're
[1:36:26] walking by Faith by little church catch
[1:36:28] a vision of the Unseen World and let
[1:36:31] that Soul pass by every barrier oh
[1:36:35] Hallelujah I feel good this morning that
[1:36:37] you're not just hoping there's a Rapture
[1:36:40] but you see it oh you see it and say
[1:36:43] devil you don't got enough to keep me
[1:36:46] out of it I see
[1:36:49] it Hallelujah but what's what what I
[1:36:53] love about is job didn't wait until he
[1:36:56] seen the Fulfillment to Rejoice no he
[1:36:59] wasn't there yet but the glimpse of the
[1:37:01] Unseen was enough for him to rejoice it
[1:37:05] was enough to say oh man I'm going to be
[1:37:08] there you see too many times we try
[1:37:10] waiting for the Fulfillment of promises
[1:37:14] before we can thank God for it come on
[1:37:17] now even when you can't see it yet you
[1:37:19] can still thank God for it when you're
[1:37:22] still sick you you thank God for healing
[1:37:25] you don't wait for the Fulfillment you
[1:37:27] wait for the promise and when the
[1:37:29] promise is made clear to you by your
[1:37:31] understanding then you thank God for it
[1:37:34] then you rejoice now even more before
[1:37:37] blessed are they that have not seen
[1:37:39] right you have not seen it yet but you
[1:37:42] understand that it's yours and here he
[1:37:45] was he didn't wait for the Fulfillment
[1:37:47] all he had was a promise and you know
[1:37:49] brother brand would talk about Jonah and
[1:37:51] said Jonah refused to see any anything
[1:37:53] contrary he was down in the belly of the
[1:37:56] whale in the bottom of the sea but he
[1:37:58] said that won't hide me he said once
[1:38:01] more will I look toward your Holy Temple
[1:38:03] what was he looking at catch this now
[1:38:06] what was he looking at he actually
[1:38:08] couldn't see the temple but he seen the
[1:38:11] promise made by the temple oh he didn't
[1:38:15] see it naturally but he was looking to a
[1:38:17] promise and the promise even though he
[1:38:20] was not in the Fulfillment yet cuz the
[1:38:22] Bible was saying that he would he would
[1:38:24] he would stop and praise God with
[1:38:26] Thanksgiving right he would praise God
[1:38:29] with Thanksgiving once he got a glimpse
[1:38:31] of a promise even though he was not in
[1:38:34] the Fulfillment yet he got a glimpse of
[1:38:37] the
[1:38:38] promise oh Hallelujah and he continues
[1:38:41] on oh God if we can only see the promise
[1:38:44] of the word the go go Christ has
[1:38:46] promised wherever two or three are
[1:38:48] assembled in my name I am in their midst
[1:38:51] and whatever they ask they shall receive
[1:38:54] if we could see it and the first move
[1:38:57] move right into it don't wait any longer
[1:39:00] what are you looking for he says what
[1:39:03] are you looking for and he says that
[1:39:05] whenever he seen the first move and he
[1:39:07] and he gives multiple examples he used
[1:39:09] them many times the first move and he he
[1:39:11] he tyes that first move to the promises
[1:39:14] of God he says once he seen the first
[1:39:16] move then he moved right into it he
[1:39:19] didn't see the Fulfillment he seen the
[1:39:21] first move of the pr PR oh we've got
[1:39:25] promises in this generation you have not
[1:39:27] seen the Fulfillment yet but you're
[1:39:29] enjoying the first move which is the
[1:39:31] promise that's coming to you and saying
[1:39:34] here's the Unseen oh Hallelujah brother
[1:39:36] brandom talks about whenever Jesus would
[1:39:39] Rite into the City and it's so
[1:39:41] incredible that here comes Jesus writing
[1:39:44] he's fulfilling scripture right he's
[1:39:46] he's upon the donkey riding to the
[1:39:48] riding into the City and here come the
[1:39:50] people that were coming and worshiping
[1:39:52] Jesus and here the Brandon would say the
[1:39:55] here here he comes riding into the city
[1:39:57] just exactly what the word said he would
[1:39:59] do riding on the little donkey coming
[1:40:01] into the city those who were not looking
[1:40:03] at the Creed not looking at the temple
[1:40:06] not looking at these other things not
[1:40:09] looking up the priest what they had to
[1:40:11] say those that believed him that were
[1:40:14] standing there with palm in their hand
[1:40:16] just waiting for the first move you
[1:40:19] never heard them say who's coming oh no
[1:40:21] they knew who was coming they knew knew
[1:40:23] what the word said they were waiting
[1:40:25] there with the first move the promise
[1:40:27] and whenever the Fulfillment came they
[1:40:30] recognized it oh Hallelujah brother
[1:40:33] brandom says who they came from the
[1:40:35] temple and it's so incredible he says
[1:40:37] they came from the temple not the
[1:40:40] unbeliever saying who is this man he
[1:40:42] says they said that because they weren't
[1:40:45] waiting for him but those who were
[1:40:47] waiting for him didn't say who is this
[1:40:50] they knew who it was oh we're not
[1:40:53] setting here saying what is the
[1:40:54] supernatural where's the supernatural we
[1:40:57] know the supernatural we're expecting
[1:40:59] the supernatural we don't come to church
[1:41:01] and say oh man I hope he's here we know
[1:41:04] he's here we got a promise we got the
[1:41:06] first move where two or three are
[1:41:08] gathered in my name I will be in their
[1:41:10] midst even when we're not in the
[1:41:12] Fulfillment yet we expect it and we wait
[1:41:15] for the Fulfillment here they stood
[1:41:17] Jesus said they already have the stuff
[1:41:18] in their brother brandom says they
[1:41:20] already have the stuff in their hand
[1:41:21] they were waiting to put it down on the
[1:41:23] ground because they knew prophecy was
[1:41:26] coming down the road they didn't wait
[1:41:28] could you imagine if they're sitting
[1:41:30] around and they waited for Jesus to
[1:41:32] enter into the city to grab the Palm
[1:41:34] right they would have missed him no they
[1:41:36] were waiting with anticipation they knew
[1:41:39] he was coming down they already was
[1:41:41] ready they grabbed the Palm they was
[1:41:42] ready they s there ready ready for their
[1:41:46] visitation and I say little church let's
[1:41:48] get ready for our visitation come on now
[1:41:50] we're not coming here out of Duty and
[1:41:52] what some incredible I know I'm running
[1:41:54] out of time but the brown say it brother
[1:41:57] the Brown says the the priest ran out to
[1:41:59] see the religious commotion was about
[1:42:02] and the people said who is this what
[1:42:04] were they there for friends a religious
[1:42:07] feast the very God that had them to
[1:42:11] ordain the feast told them that he would
[1:42:14] be there just like that and they cried
[1:42:17] who is it so here the reason that
[1:42:19] they're in the city in the first place
[1:42:22] was because God told him to do a feast
[1:42:25] and the Very one that told him to do the
[1:42:27] feast was coming into the city and they
[1:42:29] said who was it oh they took the words
[1:42:33] of God and made a tradition and since
[1:42:35] they made it a tradition they missed
[1:42:37] their visitation oh little church don't
[1:42:39] let us come to church out of a tradition
[1:42:42] come on and Jen God comes with his
[1:42:44] anointing with his word trying to bring
[1:42:47] a Revival trying to bring bring some
[1:42:49] stimulation trying to bring a
[1:42:51] fulfillment of promises but we're here
[1:42:53] out of
[1:42:54] tradition oh I'm preaching now but we're
[1:42:57] here and we say who is this oh it's
[1:42:59] another message by our pastor who is
[1:43:01] this another message by the by the
[1:43:03] Evangelist who is this but let us catch
[1:43:05] who it is it's more than a sermon it's
[1:43:08] the greatest
[1:43:09] attraction come on now it's more than
[1:43:12] just the sermon of Dos and dos it's the
[1:43:14] greatest attraction bringing you the
[1:43:17] invisible God and say here he is he's
[1:43:19] fulfilling the scripture here's the
[1:43:22] deity made visible riding upon a donkey
[1:43:26] just like the word said and it wasn't
[1:43:28] just any donkey it was a predestinated
[1:43:31] donkey it wasn't just any donkey we
[1:43:34] haven't just got any word we've got the
[1:43:36] predestinated word we haven't just got
[1:43:38] any pastor we got the predestinated
[1:43:41] pastor for this church you're not just
[1:43:43] sitting here by accident God
[1:43:45] predestinated you to be here today to be
[1:43:48] in py to be in church this morning how
[1:43:51] come he's fulf F in his word don't miss
[1:43:55] him don't miss him don't miss your
[1:43:58] Revival don't miss the Fulfillment oh
[1:44:02] give me a few more minutes brother
[1:44:03] Brandon would talk about would talk
[1:44:05] about how that uh uh let me find that
[1:44:08] let me find it here brother Brown would
[1:44:11] say this here uh he the first move at
[1:44:14] the pool of Bethesda they rushed and got
[1:44:16] into it amen oh the people here if you
[1:44:19] haven't received the Holy Ghost this
[1:44:20] morning if the first little tinkle would
[1:44:23] say that's the truth this man is telling
[1:44:26] the truth then hurry as quick as you can
[1:44:29] don't wait what what are you looking at
[1:44:31] what are you waiting for the hour is
[1:44:34] later than you think go get moving
[1:44:36] towards it as fast as you can why when
[1:44:39] Elijah saw the move he was talking about
[1:44:42] the the The Cloud of of a man's hand
[1:44:44] remember he says when Elijah saw the
[1:44:46] move it was the evidence of an answered
[1:44:50] prayer it did not seem like anything
[1:44:53] special he he he did not see he would
[1:44:55] tell tell Gaza go out there look he
[1:44:58] would go nothing there he says go look
[1:45:00] again nothing's there go look again it
[1:45:03] did not matter how small that cloud was
[1:45:07] he realized this was the answer to his
[1:45:09] prayer oh it don't matter how little the
[1:45:12] sermons are it could be the answer to
[1:45:14] your prayer come on now you may say
[1:45:17] brother Josh you're dragging us this
[1:45:18] morning it could be the answer it could
[1:45:21] be the answer to come and stabilize your
[1:45:23] emotions to stabilize your mind to
[1:45:26] stabilize your thinking you see I I
[1:45:29] don't believe that Wednesday night
[1:45:30] service is even when our pastor teaching
[1:45:32] on the church ages that could be an
[1:45:34] answered prayer right it could be some
[1:45:37] stability to come and bring
[1:45:39] understanding you see nothing happens by
[1:45:42] accident it could be an answered prayer
[1:45:44] for the brand say oh God I wish that
[1:45:46] every sick person here this morning that
[1:45:48] fills the holy spirit in our presence
[1:45:50] now could realize that's the evidence
[1:45:53] of a prayer you prayed has been answered
[1:45:56] in the presence of God every man that
[1:45:58] wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:46:00] you feel that little Grand feeling
[1:46:02] saying I believe that's the truth if you
[1:46:05] take that that's the evidence of my
[1:46:08] answered prayer and he says raise up
[1:46:10] your hands and say God I receive it now
[1:46:13] something would take place and in all of
[1:46:15] this he's talking about the first
[1:46:17] move and he says it's the word coming
[1:46:19] forth and he says when the word comes
[1:46:21] forth and something Rises up and he says
[1:46:24] that's the truth he says that's your
[1:46:26] answered prayer not waiting for the
[1:46:28] Fulfillment but something recognizes
[1:46:31] this is what I'm praying for this is the
[1:46:34] peace I've been wanting this is the joy
[1:46:37] I've been wanting this is the Holy Ghost
[1:46:39] for my children I've been wanting if you
[1:46:41] can just recognize this is the greatest
[1:46:44] attraction little musicians come this is
[1:46:47] the greatest attraction coming to answer
[1:46:50] the
[1:46:51] prayer to answer the prayer I don't
[1:46:54] believe this message is a message of
[1:46:56] condemnation of dos and don'ts it's your
[1:46:59] answered
[1:47:00] prayer it's your it's your Revival it's
[1:47:03] your it's it's your deliverance it's
[1:47:05] your
[1:47:06] joy oh my you see he when the angel of
[1:47:11] the Lord would trouble The Waters at the
[1:47:12] pool of Bethesda that was an answered
[1:47:14] prayer for somebody but only that one
[1:47:17] person that could step into the water
[1:47:20] that was their answered prayer but what
[1:47:23] about the guy with the infirmity that
[1:47:25] sat there for what 38 years he was
[1:47:28] praying he was praying but yet he
[1:47:30] couldn't get there he just couldn't do
[1:47:33] it whenever he tried everything he could
[1:47:35] do and what's so incredible is the Angel
[1:47:39] didn't make himself visible the water
[1:47:41] would his trouble right so everybody
[1:47:44] else just got something invisible you
[1:47:47] know a wind could have went by and stir
[1:47:49] it I don't know but not this man this
[1:47:52] man had no doubts this wasn't an angel
[1:47:55] this wasn't a feeling this wasn't an
[1:47:57] emotion this was deity in flesh walking
[1:48:01] up bypassing everybody else and coming
