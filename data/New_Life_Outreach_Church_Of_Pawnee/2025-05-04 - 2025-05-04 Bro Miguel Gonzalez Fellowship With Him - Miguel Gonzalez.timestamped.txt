[19:57] the tiredness or the different vanities
[20:00] and lies of the flesh that are there,
[20:02] Lord. that we would just be able to to

[20:37] [Music]
[20:47] tears and
[20:49] sorrows. I have
[20:51] questions for
[20:55] tomorrow. Many times I
[21:03] [Music]
[21:06] need
[21:08] every situation.
[21:12] [Music]
[21:20] Christ
[21:28] only through it
[21:31] [Music]
[21:33] all. Through it
[21:38] all, I learn to trust in
[21:43] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[21:49] God. Through it
[21:54] all, oh through it all,
[21:59] [Music]
[22:13] to a lot of
[22:17] places and seen a lot of
[22:22] faces. There were times I felt so all
[22:27] alone.
[22:30] [Music]
[22:35] lonely
[22:37] hours. Yes, those precious lonely
[22:42] hours. Jesus, let me know that I'm
[22:49] [Music]
[22:52] still through it
[22:57] all. Through it
[23:02] all, I learn to trust in
[23:07] Jesus. I learn to trust in
[23:13] God. Do it
[23:18] all. Do it all.
[23:28] within his
[23:33] word. So I thank God for the
[23:38] mountains and I thank him for the
[23:43] valley and I thank him for the storm he
[23:49] brought me through.
[23:55] or if I
[23:57] then had a
[24:00] problem, I would know that he could
[24:04] solve them. I would know faith in God
[24:10] could
[24:15] do through it all.
[24:21] through
[24:22] [Music]
[24:25] y'all. I learn to trust in
[24:30] Jesus. I learn to trust in God.
[24:36] Through it
[24:40] all, through it
[24:43] [Music]
[24:47] all depend upon his word.
[24:57] [Music]
[25:04] comes up. It's a new day
[25:09] dawning. It's time to sing your song
[25:16] again. Whatever may pass and whatever
[25:21] lies before
[25:24] me, let me be singing when the
[25:29] evening
[25:31] comes. Bless the Lord, oh my
[25:36] soul. Oh my
[25:39] soul. Worship his
[25:42] holy
[25:45] name. Sing like never
[25:50] before. Oh my soul, I will worship his
[25:56] holy name.
[26:01] You're
[26:02] reaching love and you're slow to
[26:08] anger. Your name is great and your heart
[26:13] is
[26:14] kind for all your goodness I will keep
[26:20] on singing.
[26:25] and prisons for my heart to
[26:31] find. Bless the Lord, oh my
[26:35] soul, oh my
[26:39] soul. Worship his
[26:41] holy
[26:44] name. Sing like never before.
[26:50] Oh my soul, I will worship his
[26:55] holy
[26:59] name. And on that day when my strength
[27:04] is
[27:07] very draws near and my time has come.
[27:13] Still my soul will sing your love
[27:21] unique. 10,000 years in
[27:25] forever,
[27:28] Lord. Bless the Lord, oh my
[27:32] soul. Oh, my
[27:36] soul. Worship his
[27:38] holy name.
[27:43] like never
[27:46] before. Oh my soul, I will worship.
[27:53] Can we sing that one more time as we
[27:55] come for the offering?
[27:57] [Music]
[27:59] Bless the Lord, oh my
[28:02] soul. Oh my
[28:05] soul, worship his holy name.
[28:12] Sing like never
[28:15] before. Oh my soul, I will worship his
[28:21] holy name.
[28:24] [Music]
[28:29] Lord Jesus, we thank you for many
[28:31] blessings. Lord, I just pray bless these
[28:33] tithes and these offerings in Jesus
[28:35] name. Amen.
[28:44] wash
[28:46] away my
[28:49] sin. Nothing but the blood of
[28:56] Jesus. What can make me whole again?
[29:03] Nothing but the blood of
[29:11] Jesus.
[29:12] Preious is the
[29:15] flow
[29:17] that may be white as
[29:22] snow.
[29:24] No
[29:25] other plow I know.
[29:30] Nothing but the blood of
[29:33] [Music]
[29:35] Jesus. Oh my
[29:38] part. This I
[29:41] see nothing but the blood of
[29:48] Jesus. For my
[29:51] pins, this I
[29:54] plead. Nothing but the blood of me.
[30:01] Jesus.
[30:02] Oh,
[30:04] precious is the
[30:07] flow
[30:09] that makes me white as
[30:13] snow.
[30:15] No
[30:16] other ground. I
[30:20] know nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[30:26] [Music]
[30:32] Can we sing that song as Sister Rosanna
[30:33] comes with her
[30:34] [Music]
[30:39] special? Let the worshippers
[30:42] [Music]
[30:49] arise in the sand.
[30:53] be standing by your
[30:56] side, holding your hand. Let your kingom
[31:02] come. Let it live in me. This is my
[31:07] [Music]
[31:09] prayer. This is
[31:12] my worship.
[31:16] [Music]
[31:19] Let the sons and the daughters
[31:22] [Music]
[31:24] sing. I'm
[31:26] surrendering my
[31:30] [Music]
[31:31] all. I surrender to the
[31:36] king. Father, I hear you growing
[31:40] louder. The song of your
[31:43] redee as the saints from every
[31:46] nation. Our awakening will sing from our
[31:51] heart to come to
[31:54] name. Hear the heaven dream. This is our
[31:59] song. You are king but the worippers
[32:04] cry.
[32:09] Let the sons and daughters
[32:14] see. I'm
[32:16] surrendering my
[32:21] all. I surrender to the king.
[32:29] [Music]
[32:40] [Music]
[32:45] [Music]
[32:50] I was lost when you found me
[32:55] here. You pulled me close and held me.
[33:00] [Music]
[33:02] I'm a fool, but still you
[33:07] love I'll be a fool for the king of
[33:12] love. You gave me wings so I could
[33:21] [Music]
[33:24] fly. And all I have is all from you.
[33:30] And all I want is all of
[33:34] you. It's
[33:37] grace. Your
[33:39] grace. I'm nothing without
[33:45] you. Is
[33:48] grace. Your grace shines on me.
[33:54] [Music]
[33:58] There have been days when I've walked
[34:03] away. Too much to carry, nothing left to
[34:08] say. Forgive me, Lord, when I'm weak and
[34:13] lost. You traded heaven for a wooden
[34:19] cross. And all these years you've
[34:22] carried me.
[34:25] You've been my eyes when I could not
[34:30] see. And beauty grows in the driving
[34:35] rain. Your oil of gladness in the times
[34:39] of
[34:40] pain is
[34:42] grace. Your
[34:45] grace. I'm nothing without
[34:51] you. It's grace.
[34:54] Your grace shines on
[35:02] me. It's
[35:04] grace. Your
[35:07] grace. I'm nothing without
[35:12] you. It's
[35:15] grace. Your grace shines on me.
[35:23] shines on
[35:25] me. Shines on
[35:27] me. Your grace that shines on
[35:32] me. Shines on
[35:35] me. Shines on me. It's your
[35:43] grace. It's
[35:45] grace. Your
[35:48] grace. I'm nothing without you.
[35:53] you. It's
[35:55] grace. Your grace shines on
[36:03] me. It's
[36:05] grace, your
[36:08] grace. I'm nothing without
[36:13] you. It's

[40:08] generation for this day that we live in.
[40:12] It's just wonderful to be here in the
[40:14] house of the Lord. And good to see
[40:16] everybody after our barbecue
[40:19] extravaganza that we had. And I didn't
[40:22] know if that was just a new scent that
[40:25] was going on or if everybody just smelt
[40:27] like barbecue like me. You
[40:29] know, my wife kept telling me all or all
[40:32] day yesterday, she's like, "You smell
[40:33] like barbecue." you don't do that. Well,
[40:36] you know, it's where I am. It's what I'm
[40:37] doing at the moment. And uh just
[40:40] wonderful to be here at the house of the
[40:43] Lord and just to see everybody here. And
[40:46] um just want to thank everybody for uh
[40:49] helping out with the uh rib dinner.
[40:53] They're the just a wonderful job.
[40:55] Everybody did such a great job of uh
[41:00] keeping everything together. you know,
[41:02] something at that level requires a lot
[41:04] of moving parts. You know, there's a lot
[41:06] of a lot of people taking care of the
[41:09] well, mainly Joe taking care of the the
[41:12] ribs and the smoking and doing those
[41:15] kinds of things and uh out there just
[41:18] I'm just, you know, not savvy when it
[41:20] comes to that kind of stuff. I'm just
[41:22] manual labor, you know, and um want to
[41:26] appre appreciate Sister Stephanie uh
[41:29] manning the fort there inside of the the
[41:32] little trailer thing there
[41:34] and keeping everybody together and the
[41:36] team that was involved with her there
[41:38] just keeping it together and uh the
[41:42] parking crew keeping everybody
[41:43] organized, you know, in in there. And
[41:47] um you know, it looks easy. It's like,
[41:50] you know, you could just take a car, put
[41:51] it in that empty spot, you know, but
[41:54] sometimes when you got people going in
[41:56] and out and, you know, jams that happen
[41:59] here and there, you got to kind of be
[42:00] quick on the draw and they took care of
[42:03] things real nicely. And, uh, just
[42:05] everybody that I even seen, Brother Ken
[42:07] came down and tested the ribs out there,
[42:09] you know, and and um, you know, just
[42:13] such a, you know, everybody just kind of
[42:15] coming together and putting their
[42:16] shoulder to the wheel. And we kind of do
[42:18] that once a year, you know, so we can,
[42:21] you know, do things around here at the
[42:23] church and uh, you know, keep things
[42:25] going and whatnot. And, uh, it was just
[42:28] a just a good time. And also, you know,
[42:31] it's just a great time to for the
[42:33] community to see our church and and uh
[42:35] you know, it's I think it's kind of
[42:38] ironic, but I think the Lord put us just
[42:40] right here in the main thoroughfare
[42:41] where everybody in Ponyie and all the
[42:44] visitors see us as we go by and you guys
[42:47] just shining your light and everybody's
[42:50] like, "What is this for?" And I'm like,
[42:51] "Oh, this is for our church." And
[42:53] they're like, "Oh, wow. you guys and and
[42:55] they kind of get to see and notice us
[42:57] and it's just wonderful to be in front
[42:59] of the community and um but uh we'll go
[43:03] ahead and move on into our sermon here
[43:06] this morning and like to thank our
[43:08] musicians, the last of our
[43:11] musicians that
[43:13] are as everybody knows most of the
[43:16] congregation, the church is up there
[43:18] with uh in Virginia for the Virginia
[43:20] meetings up there and I hear they're
[43:23] just having a great time. And I mean,
[43:26] with the lineup that they have, they
[43:27] should be, you know, I mean, they should
[43:30] be. I mean, they got some wonderful
[43:32] ministers there and and uh the Lord's
[43:34] just really blessing those services and
[43:37] they have been the Lord has been
[43:39] blessing those services for the past
[43:41] several years and just um just a real
[43:44] outpouring over there. And that's that's
[43:46] just good. And our church is a part of
[43:48] that that's over there. And uh you know
[43:51] we brother Sean was from here and and
[43:54] now he's over there and so he gets to
[43:56] take a little bit of Oklahoma over there
[43:58] with him. And uh if we could we can just
[44:00] go ahead and move into our scriptures as
[44:03] and I'd like to start there. First uh
[44:06] first John uh one and I'd like to start
[44:10] there in one uh 1 John 1 and
[44:19] one and uh just say amen when you get
[44:24] there and I'll
[44:26] uh proceed. But it says here John 1 and1
[44:33] it says that which was from the
[44:36] beginning which we have heard which we
[44:38] have seen with our eyes which we have
[44:40] looked upon looked
[44:42] upon our hands have handled with the
[44:45] word of life.
[44:47] For the life was ministered or
[44:49] manifested, and we have seen it, and we
[44:52] bear witness and show it unto you, that
[44:55] eternal life which was with the Father
[44:58] and was manifested unto
[45:01] us. And that which we have seen and have
[45:06] declared we unto you, that ye also may
[45:09] have fellowship with us. And truly our
[45:12] fellowship is with the Father and with
[45:14] the Son, Jesus Christ.
[45:17] These things write we unto you, that
[45:20] your joy may be full. This then is the
[45:23] message which we have heard of him, and
[45:26] declared unto you, that God is light,
[45:28] and in him is no darkness at all. If we
[45:32] say that we have fellowship with him,
[45:34] and walk in darkness, we lie and do not
[45:37] the truth. But if we walk in the light
[45:39] as he is the light, we have fellowship
[45:42] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[45:44] Christ, his son, cleanses us from all
[45:48] sin. Let's just bow our hearts here this
[45:50] morning. Heavenly Father, we just love
[45:52] you, Lord, and we thank you for your
[45:55] word, Lord. We thank you for just being
[45:58] able to come to your house, Lord, and
[46:00] just being able to relax and be in
[46:02] peace, Lord. Father, I would just ask
[46:04] that you would just bless the service
[46:06] this morning, Lord. Lord, we thank you
[46:08] for the song service and Lord, for the
[46:11] brothers there on the music. We'd ask a
[46:13] blessing on them. And I would just pray,
[46:15] Lord, that you'd just be with us,
[46:17] strengthen, encourage all of our friends
[46:19] and family, Lord, that are away from us
[46:21] at the moment. Give them safe travel and
[46:23] mercies, Lord. We thank you. We ask
[46:25] these things in Jesus name.
[46:28] Amen. Well, I guess I better turn this
[46:31] off.
[46:34] Weston trying to call
[46:36] me. But but uh you know if I had a if I
[46:40] had a title for this morning, it would
[46:41] be fellowship. Fellowship in him. And
[46:46] you know uh I think it we all we all
[46:49] pretty well know that fellowship is
[46:51] pretty vital both spiritually, you know,
[46:53] and physically. You know that you know
[46:56] fellowship one with another. Uh you know
[46:58] we have there's a lot of things that we
[47:00] could fellowship over and and uh you
[47:02] know a lot of us have friends and a lot
[47:05] of us have close family and you know
[47:07] with uh you know the guys you know the
[47:10] guys have fellowship one with another
[47:12] there's a lot of things a lot of
[47:14] discussions that goes on you know it
[47:15] could be tools or it could be sports you
[47:18] know or it could be you know uh job
[47:21] related things you know or um you know
[47:24] different things and you girls are kind
[47:25] of the same way of course with the
[47:27] girls, the the the conversation topics
[47:30] could be a lot broader, you know, there
[47:32] there's a lot there's a lot that goes on
[47:34] when that happens, you know, and I just
[47:35] kind of stay away from those kinds of
[47:37] conversations. And uh but you know
[47:39] there's a lot of different things that
[47:41] the women talk about and you know and
[47:43] I'm not going to begin to going on into
[47:45] that you know but you know the clothes
[47:47] and you know uh uh uh candles you know
[47:51] and colors and pillows and you know just
[47:54] all kinds of different things you know
[47:56] that goes on with the with the women
[47:58] folk you know and but the thing is is
[48:00] you know uh you know you have to have
[48:02] something in common one with another you
[48:04] know there's a lot of there's a lot of
[48:06] things that you know that uh you do you
[48:09] don't really find a whole lot of people
[48:11] with different interests um necessarily
[48:14] hanging around with each other. you
[48:16] know, there's they're acquaintances, you
[48:17] know, and we had different, but then you
[48:19] have somebody that you can actually have
[48:21] fellowship with, you know, that there's
[48:23] somebody that, you know, that that you
[48:25] can kind of connect with, you know, or
[48:27] or there's you just happen to find likes
[48:29] or dislikes, you know, and you guys
[48:31] happen to like the same songs or like
[48:34] the same foods or different things like
[48:36] that, you know, and it kind of draws you
[48:38] together. And uh you know and you know
[48:40] guys you know they have a uh you know a
[48:42] lot of guys you'll see different groups
[48:44] of different men you know uh you know
[48:46] the different ones that like to hunt and
[48:47] you you go to the fellowship hall and
[48:49] and sometimes you'll find all the
[48:51] hunters together over here you know you
[48:53] know then you find all the guys that
[48:55] work on you know work on cars and
[48:58] different things you know those guys are
[48:59] all over here you know or you know just
[49:01] different ones you know and then the
[49:03] same way with the ladies there's just a
[49:05] lot of different personalities and
[49:06] things that that causes you to to click,
[49:08] you know, and and through these things,
[49:10] we develop friends and we develop, you
[49:13] know, you know, some of us even get
[49:15] married, you know, I mean, you look at
[49:17] Austin. I mean, it actually happened to
[49:19] him, you know, and and and and but you
[49:22] know, and fellowship is is a is a vital
[49:24] is a vital thing for for for uh a church
[49:28] and it's a vital thing for, you know, uh
[49:30] uh brothers and sisters to be able to
[49:33] find that godly fellowship with with one
[49:35] another, you know, and and you know,
[49:38] thinking about these things, you know,
[49:39] the fellowship that we have, you know,
[49:42] with one another is something that's
[49:43] important. It's something that I think
[49:45] that it's good for a brother and a
[49:47] sister, you know, to be able to have
[49:49] godly acquaintances and godly
[49:51] fellowship, godly friends, you know, and
[49:53] thinking about some of these uh just
[49:56] thinking about some of these scriptures.
[49:58] I was thinking about uh you know, in 1
[50:00] Corinthians 10 and 20, you know, if our
[50:02] sister Clea would pull that up. And you
[50:05] know, and I was thinking about some of
[50:06] these things about how that you know,
[50:08] fellowship is important, but then
[50:09] there's also fellowship that, you know,
[50:11] that we'd like to stay with or stay away
[50:13] from, you know, and and thinking about
[50:15] these things there in the 20th verse, it
[50:17] says, "But I say that I say that the
[50:19] things which the Gentiles sacrifice,
[50:22] they sacrifice to devils and not to God.
[50:25] And I would not that ye have fellowship
[50:27] with devils." And we can go to the next
[50:30] verse. It says you cannot drink the cup
[50:32] of the Lord and the cup of the devils.
[50:34] You cannot part be partakers of the
[50:36] Lord's table and of the table of devils.
[50:38] You know, and thinking about this, the
[50:40] scriptures basically say keep asking us
[50:42] to stay away from fellowship, you know,
[50:45] for non-believers. You know, you can
[50:47] also go into another portion of
[50:48] scripture there in 2 Corinthians 6 and
[50:52] 13. And this these are some things, you
[50:54] know, just kind of brush upon and think
[50:56] about it. It says, "Now for a recompense
[50:59] in the same, I speak as unto you, my
[51:02] children, be ye also enlarged, but be
[51:05] not unequally yolked together with
[51:08] unbelievers. For what fellowship hath
[51:10] righteousness with unrighteousness, and
[51:13] what communion hath light with
[51:15] darkness?" And thinking about these
[51:18] kinds of things, you know, we don't have
[51:20] fellowship with something that we're
[51:21] don't have anything in common with. you
[51:24] know, there's not a lot, you know, you
[51:25] don't see red birds hanging out with
[51:27] bluebirds. You don't see bluebirds
[51:28] hanging out with sparrows. You know, a
[51:30] lot of those things, you know, birds
[51:32] together, you know, the flock together
[51:33] or something like that, you know, I
[51:34] probably butchered that, but that's all
[51:36] right, you know. But but you know you
[51:38] have a lot of you have a lot of the
[51:40] species and wildlife you know you have
[51:42] deer that run with deer you know horses
[51:44] they go with horses you know birds are
[51:45] with birds you know and that's the same
[51:47] way with the way that it is with the
[51:49] Christian walk and about how that you
[51:51] know it's important to have fellowship
[51:53] with one another because it strengthens
[51:55] us in the Lord and you know sometimes
[51:58] you know fellowship is not all
[52:00] necessarily based upon materialistic
[52:02] things but it's also based upon divine
[52:05] things there's a lot of things that
[52:07] having fellowship with one another is
[52:09] not necessarily having things in common,
[52:12] but you know, the one thing that
[52:14] attracts you is your spirits with one
[52:16] another. You know, there's just
[52:17] something about me and Mike, you know. I
[52:19] I don't know what it is. You know, he's
[52:20] he's Mike King, you know, and it's just
[52:22] there's something about, you know, me
[52:24] and Mike. We we think we think on the
[52:26] same level, you know. we we know when
[52:28] it's time to drink coffee because I'm
[52:30] looking at Mike and Mike's like, you
[52:31] know, he's got that look like it's time
[52:33] to drink coffee, you know, and I can I
[52:35] can see what's going on there, you know,
[52:37] and and you know, about how that, you
[52:39] know, having the fellowship with your
[52:41] brother or your sister, you know, is is
[52:44] super is super important, you know, and
[52:46] and we need these things in order to,
[52:48] you know, to move on and having friends
[52:50] with God and and and and having this
[52:53] relationship, but yet it's not all
[52:55] necessarily based upon, you
[52:57] materialistic things, but it's also has
[52:59] a spiritual meaning as well because you
[53:01] know it's not we can have these things
[53:04] and and and you know brother Joe Sanders
[53:06] you know he might he we might like we
[53:09] might like both like electrical but
[53:11] electrical is not going to get me to
[53:12] heaven you know and and and you know
[53:14] there's a lot of things you know that we
[53:16] could have a we can have a a fellowship
[53:19] or we can have something in common you
[53:21] know with one another but you know if if
[53:24] all the guys is if all we talk about is
[53:26] sports and all we talk about is hunting
[53:28] and all we talk about is fishing. Those
[53:30] things aren't going to get us to heaven.
[53:32] And and you know, these things aren't
[53:33] going to be something that's going to
[53:34] be, well, Lord, you know, I know I know
[53:36] all you know, I know all about the deer
[53:38] calls. you know, I know I got the best
[53:40] camo, you know, and I've got the nicest
[53:42] guns and and you sisters might be able
[53:44] to sit here and be able to like, you
[53:45] know, Lord, you know, uh, we decorated
[53:47] the house just right and we did this and
[53:49] we did that and we did that, you know,
[53:51] but the thing that um, the thing that
[53:54] gets that gets me is a scripture where
[53:56] it goes and it talks about how that, you
[53:59] know, depart from me you workers of
[54:00] iniquity that I never knew you. And it's
[54:03] not the fact that Jesus didn't know who
[54:05] they are. And it's not the fact that
[54:06] Jesus doesn't know who we are, but it's
[54:09] the same fact that he had never had a
[54:11] relationship with that individual. And
[54:14] that's the kind of thing that God is
[54:15] requiring today is is that is God
[54:18] doesn't just want to know what you're
[54:21] doing, you know, on your off time. God
[54:23] doesn't want to know the things that you
[54:24] like, but he's asking for something more
[54:26] intimate with with him. and and you know
[54:29] and that kind seem that kind of seems
[54:32] you know a little interesting because of
[54:34] the fact that there's not a physical
[54:35] form you know of Jesus that is walking
[54:38] around here today that we can actually
[54:40] just sit down and we can have a talk but
[54:42] yet in the same in the same perspective
[54:45] there is because you know the thing was
[54:48] is that you know in order to have we can
[54:50] have fellowship with our brother and we
[54:52] can have fellowship with our sisters and
[54:54] in the bodies that we see here you know
[54:56] we could visit with each other after
[54:58] church, we go to the Mexican restaurant,
[55:00] we go to clicks, you know, we drive
[55:02] around, we hunt, we fish, we do all
[55:04] these other things, but yet at the same
[55:06] time that se the uh the the fellowship
[55:09] that we have with one another isn't
[55:11] necessarily separated isn't necessarily
[55:14] separated or we're not separated from
[55:17] each other by things unless we get mad
[55:20] with each other. And if that's the case,
[55:21] then you need to repent and go to the
[55:23] altar. You know what I'm saying? you're
[55:24] getting mad with each other, then then
[55:26] that's just that's just cut and dry.
[55:28] That's just how it is. But yet, the
[55:30] thing that separated the thing that
[55:32] separates us from the Lord was sin. And
[55:34] we know that that that sin came into
[55:37] came into the whole realm, came into the
[55:40] whole deal with, you know, uh at the
[55:42] beginning, but yet sin has been able to
[55:44] divide man and God for such a long time.
[55:47] him and God has been going throughout
[55:49] this space of time being able to try to
[55:52] uh to bring his sons and daughters back
[55:55] to him. And and that's the thing that we
[55:57] have here today is is being able to or
[56:00] trying to do is to be able to develop a
[56:02] fellowship not with your man. Church
[56:03] isn't a place that we can come to to
[56:06] just to be able to shake hands with your
[56:07] brothers and sisters and and be able to
[56:10] say, "Well, I know this person or I know
[56:12] that person." And and unfortunately,
[56:14] there's a lot of believers that are here
[56:15] today that are just like, well, you
[56:17] know, I'm good friends with this
[56:18] minister or I'm good friends with this
[56:20] singer or I'm good friends with this
[56:22] person. And they think that that's going
[56:23] to be their pathway to heaven. And I'm
[56:26] going to tell tell you right now that
[56:28] when they get there that day that
[56:29] there's going to be a huge
[56:30] disappointment because the God's not
[56:33] desiring you to be in fellowship with a
[56:35] boyfriend or God's not developed or
[56:37] wanting you uh to develop a relationship
[56:40] with a girlfriend or or even your wife
[56:42] or your husband. Now now don't get me
[56:44] wrong, you want to develop a
[56:46] relationship there, but it's not that
[56:48] style of relationship. the relationship
[56:50] that I'm talking about is a divine
[56:53] relationship, a divine fellowship that
[56:55] you're going to have with God, you know,
[56:57] and some way and and and one uh one
[57:00] passage of scripture where I believe it
[57:02] was uh Jesus talking to Peter, I believe
[57:05] it was when he was talking about he's
[57:07] like uh uh you know, he do you love me?
[57:10] And he and he divides up God's love and
[57:12] he divides it up with an ailio love and
[57:14] he divides it with an agape love and he
[57:17] and therefore you have a human side of
[57:19] love and then you have this godly love
[57:21] the godly love that can only come from
[57:23] the scriptures that can only come from
[57:25] God and I begin to think that and I
[57:27] begin to apply that mindset to where he
[57:30] was talking about a fellowship and you
[57:31] know we have an earthly fellowship. We
[57:33] have a fellowship that we have one
[57:35] another with one another. But yet the
[57:37] fellowship that we have with one
[57:39] another. You know the the world has a
[57:41] fellowship and they can fellowship
[57:43] around sports. They fellowship around
[57:45] you know it could be alcohol. It could
[57:47] be drugs. It could they fellowship at
[57:49] the bar. They fellowship you know at at
[57:51] sports bars. They fellowship you know in
[57:53] a lot of different places. But yet
[57:55] there's something that's inside of them
[57:57] that's searching. There's something
[57:59] that's inside of them that's not
[58:01] fulfilled. and and and if we're not
[58:03] careful as believers and as Christians,
[58:05] we can come to the we can come to the
[58:08] house of God and we can say that we're
[58:10] fellowshipping, but yet we're not
[58:11] fellowshipping divinely. And I think
[58:14] that that's where that's where we can
[58:15] lose our fulfillment. We have fellowship
[58:17] with, you know, I love Sister Carol to
[58:19] death and and I think she's a great
[58:21] woman and she stood for this gospel and
[58:23] she's been in this church for a long
[58:24] time, but my fellowship with Sister
[58:26] Carol is as righteous as she is and as
[58:29] and as you know, we all esteem Sister
[58:31] Carol real high in, you know, in our
[58:33] church, but yet she's can't fulfill the
[58:36] fellowship that I need that only God can
[58:39] provide. And and if we come to a church
[58:41] and we just think that, oh, you know,
[58:43] I'm going to visit Brother Joe or I'm
[58:44] going to visit Brother Michael or I'm
[58:46] going to visit Brother Wendle or I'm
[58:47] going to visit Brother Austin or Jonah.
[58:49] How many enjoyed his song leading this
[58:50] morning? Amen.
[58:53] Yeah. And if we think that And if we
[58:55] think that we're just going to come to
[58:56] church and we're just going to be able
[58:58] to come and just have a fellowship with
[59:00] a brother and sister and that's what
[59:02] church is about and then we come and
[59:04] then we go, we're missing the essence of
[59:06] what God's doing. And the thing is is
[59:08] God's word isn't here just as a a law or
[59:10] it's not here as some type of a ritual.
[59:13] But what it is is here is to effect the
[59:16] heart and soul of the believer. And what
[59:18] it's to do is it's supposed to be able
[59:20] to stamp his word inside your heart and
[59:24] and to where your thought process is
[59:26] like him to where to where you sit and
[59:28] you you change your mentality. And
[59:31] that's what it is is what the the
[59:32] message has come to do is it's been able
[59:34] it need it needs to be able to come and
[59:37] release your thinking to where you don't
[59:39] have a slave slave style mentality
[59:42] coming towards the word of God. You
[59:44] know, fellowship is okay with with with
[59:46] your brother and fellowship's okay with
[59:48] your sister, but yet at the same time we
[59:50] got to look beyond that. You know, I I
[59:53] loved how a minister said one time when
[59:54] he was preaching behind the pullpit and
[59:56] he talked about being able to look
[59:58] through binoculars and how that that
[1:00:00] looking through these binoculars, he was
[1:00:02] able, you know, you can you can get four
[1:00:04] powers, you know, you can get four power
[1:00:06] binoculars, you know, six powers and
[1:00:08] they goes all the way up to like 50 60.
[1:00:10] They got they got binoculars. You can
[1:00:11] see to space, you know, and you can you
[1:00:14] you can go out there and you could see,
[1:00:16] you know, stars and things like that,
[1:00:18] you know, and and you could see these
[1:00:20] different things. But yet at the same
[1:00:21] time in saying that is we got to have
[1:00:24] our vision beyond just what we see here
[1:00:26] in this room. We got to have our vision
[1:00:28] when we come to this this place, when we
[1:00:31] come to church and we our fellowship
[1:00:33] isn't just necessarily with our brothers
[1:00:35] or sisters or anything or or just to
[1:00:37] come and listen to hear a preacher, but
[1:00:39] we want to hear the essence of what's
[1:00:41] being or what's trying to be said. And
[1:00:43] and the thing is is is looking past that
[1:00:46] I can go back and you can find different
[1:00:48] figures in the scripture. Now, our
[1:00:50] opening scripture right here was was
[1:00:53] talking about men that was in fellowship
[1:00:55] personally with God. And you could see
[1:00:58] there and I think you uh you could see
[1:00:59] there going down in here into the verses
[1:01:03] where it said in the second verse it
[1:01:04] says, "For the life was manifested and
[1:01:07] we have seen it and bear witness and
[1:01:09] show it unto uh show unto you that
[1:01:13] eternal life which was with the father
[1:01:15] and was manifested unto us." Now, now
[1:01:18] these disciples can say this with
[1:01:20] assurityity because they walked with
[1:01:21] Jesus. They spoke with Jesus. They seen
[1:01:24] Jesus in his good time. They seen Jesus
[1:01:26] in his hard time. They seen Jesus when
[1:01:28] he was confronted. So yet the fellowship
[1:01:31] that they had had with Jesus is fresh
[1:01:34] fresh off the fresh off the oven sheet
[1:01:36] if that's how how you want to look at
[1:01:38] it. They they seen they fellowshipped
[1:01:40] with him and they wanted and going on in
[1:01:42] here is that they were expressing the
[1:01:44] same type of life that Jesus had was
[1:01:47] being expressed through them to us. That
[1:01:50] way we can see that we lack for nothing.
[1:01:53] And the thing is is is is we don't want
[1:01:55] to take on the divine nature. We don't
[1:01:58] want to take on the fellowship with just
[1:02:00] of our brother. I mean we have one Mike
[1:02:03] King. You don't need two. And and it's
[1:02:05] not my job to be Mike King. And it's not
[1:02:07] job Mike's king job to be like me. But
[1:02:10] the thing is is when we when we
[1:02:12] fellowship with him, we want to be able
[1:02:15] to ex, you know, take back what God is
[1:02:18] saying from the scripture and be able to
[1:02:20] uh impart it to your brother. And you
[1:02:22] know, and that's the divine fellowship
[1:02:24] that we're talking about is because
[1:02:26] we've all been born into this world
[1:02:28] speaking lies. We were all born as we
[1:02:30] were all saved by God's blood. And that
[1:02:32] was the thing that separated us was the
[1:02:35] fact that we couldn't have a divine
[1:02:37] fellowship. Now, you can read his word.
[1:02:39] You can go through the scriptures and
[1:02:41] you can read God's word and you can sit
[1:02:43] here and say, "Well, the Bible says
[1:02:45] don't do this and the Bible says don't
[1:02:46] do that." And you can memorize every
[1:02:48] chapter and you can memorize every story
[1:02:50] and you can memorize uh, you know, all
[1:02:53] the highlights of the scriptures and
[1:02:55] everything. But that's not what God's
[1:02:57] asking for. He's not asking for another
[1:02:59] scribe. He's not asking for somebody to
[1:03:01] be able to just document everything that
[1:03:03] he's doing, but he's asking for a
[1:03:05] friend. And the thing is is as I look
[1:03:07] back in the scripture and we often we
[1:03:09] can we can often ask oursel is is is
[1:03:12] what is it? Is it possible to be a
[1:03:14] friend of God? And I say absolutely. You
[1:03:16] know that we can look at the scriptures
[1:03:18] right where Enoch was and and and and I
[1:03:20] don't have the scripture fresh on my
[1:03:22] mind at the moment but it was talking
[1:03:24] about how that Enoch uh walked with God
[1:03:27] until he was not you know and that he
[1:03:30] but the thing is is is you think about
[1:03:32] this you've got God in eternity having
[1:03:35] fellowship with man to the point to
[1:03:37] where he was so pleased with how Enoch
[1:03:40] acted and how Enoch talked with him and
[1:03:43] and it was nothing for Enoch to be able
[1:03:45] to sit there and to be able to have
[1:03:47] one-on-one fellowship and and be able to
[1:03:50] speak and to think about about what he
[1:03:52] was thinking to where God actually, you
[1:03:55] know, opened up the heavens and accepted
[1:03:57] Enoch in into where he was and and you
[1:03:59] can also go into another passage of
[1:04:02] scripture where, you know, it talks
[1:04:04] about David there, Acts
[1:04:07] 13:21-22. And this passage of scripture
[1:04:10] is, you know, quoted many of times
[1:04:12] there, Acts 13. But thinking about this
[1:04:16] where David was talking about uh a man
[1:04:19] after God's own heart there in Acts
[1:04:22] 13:21 and it says and afterward they
[1:04:25] desired a king and God gave unto them
[1:04:28] Saul the son of Cy and a man of the
[1:04:30] tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40
[1:04:33] years and and when he had removed him he
[1:04:36] raised up unto them David to be their
[1:04:38] king in whom also he had gave testimony
[1:04:40] and said I have found David the son of
[1:04:43] Jesse a man after my own heart, which
[1:04:47] shall fulfill all my will. Now, could
[1:04:50] you think about this being written in
[1:04:51] the scriptures that you were so close to
[1:04:53] God that God referred to you as somebody
[1:04:56] that knows my will, that knows my heart,
[1:04:59] that knows my desires. And we think
[1:05:01] about this, how did David ever get to
[1:05:03] that place? David wasn't necess David in
[1:05:05] his childhood as we read through a lot
[1:05:07] of his childhood, we knew that, you
[1:05:09] know, David was the was kind of like the
[1:05:11] the the black sheep or he was the
[1:05:13] smallest or he was the one, you know,
[1:05:15] the that was left kind of out there in
[1:05:17] the back 40 to be tending to the to the
[1:05:20] uh to the sheep and he was the one that
[1:05:22] was making sure, you know, he count them
[1:05:24] all and he'd report back at the end of
[1:05:25] the day everything's okay. But this but
[1:05:28] this job was given to like the the the
[1:05:30] person that that they that that you had
[1:05:32] least expectation for. It's like well
[1:05:35] you know they have all these other
[1:05:36] brothers and we know throughout the
[1:05:38] scriptures the brothers are the ones
[1:05:39] fighting the wars. They're the ones out
[1:05:41] doing these things. But yet David was
[1:05:43] left out in the back 40 tending to the
[1:05:46] tending to God's sheep. And now the
[1:05:48] thing with David was is he didn't look
[1:05:50] at his situation as if, well, all I am
[1:05:52] is just, you know, nobody and I'm just
[1:05:54] being thrown out here on the back 40 and
[1:05:57] I'm just, you know, I'm just being put
[1:05:58] out here to, you know, to to tend some
[1:06:00] sheep and and to do these other little
[1:06:02] meaningless jobs and anything. But he
[1:06:05] took an opportunity to be able to write
[1:06:07] songs, you know. He he took the
[1:06:09] opportunity to be able to to be able to
[1:06:12] sit there on his harp and be able to
[1:06:13] create music and and to be able to, you
[1:06:16] know, to speak with the Lord one- on-one
[1:06:18] and be able to find that place alone
[1:06:21] with God. And and that was the thing
[1:06:23] that was the secret to David's success.
[1:06:25] And you could see, we all know that
[1:06:27] David wasn't, you know, some some buff
[1:06:29] guy that had been lifting weights and
[1:06:31] all of a sudden a bear comes out one day
[1:06:32] and and and David takes on a bear and
[1:06:35] just sl just slays the bear. But we know
[1:06:37] that it was the anointing behind David's
[1:06:39] or behind David that was a that gave him
[1:06:42] the ability to slay a bear. We know that
[1:06:44] a lion came at another point in his life
[1:06:47] and then he he didn't even fa it didn't
[1:06:49] even phase him a bit to where he was
[1:06:51] able to go out and he was able to
[1:06:53] destroy the lion. And but the thing was
[1:06:55] is it's not it wasn't David none of
[1:06:58] milit no military training that was on
[1:07:00] David. There was no there was no, you
[1:07:02] know, muscles that he had had or any
[1:07:04] type of education, but it was a
[1:07:06] fellowship with God, one-on-one
[1:07:08] relationship that he had had with with
[1:07:10] David to be able to give him the
[1:07:12] ability. And the thing was is having
[1:07:14] that fellowship, God knowing and and
[1:07:16] seeing and having that fellowship, it
[1:07:19] gave God confidence to be able to put
[1:07:21] his spirit into David to be able to
[1:07:24] manifest God's God's abilities through
[1:07:27] David. And another person that comes to
[1:07:29] my mind was was oh Abraham, you know,
[1:07:31] and thinking there in Abraham, Genesis
[1:07:33] 18 and and 17 and and a lot of us know
[1:07:36] the story of Abraham and how that God
[1:07:39] God used him in in a lot of in a lot of
[1:07:42] ways. And it says here in the scriptures
[1:07:44] and and the Lord said, "Shall I hide
[1:07:48] anything or shall I hide from Abraham
[1:07:51] that thing which I do?" Now think about
[1:07:54] this. God, the the the the the master of
[1:07:57] the uni. He ain't he ain't got to answer
[1:07:59] to nobody. He ain't got to talk to
[1:08:01] nobody about anything that he says or
[1:08:03] anything that he does. But yet God had
[1:08:06] such a relationship with Abraham that
[1:08:08] he's that he just openly says, "Can I
[1:08:11] hide can I hide anything or can can I
[1:08:13] hide anything from Abraham?" You know,
[1:08:15] that's just for some reason that's the
[1:08:16] way it's coming out. But can I can I
[1:08:18] hide this from Abraham? you know, can I
[1:08:21] hide the things that I'm doing from
[1:08:22] Abraham? That you God had such a
[1:08:24] confidence in Abraham. It wasn't just
[1:08:26] Abraham all of a sudden walking up to
[1:08:28] him one day and just being like, "Oh,
[1:08:30] hey, here I am, Lord. you know, I'm the
[1:08:32] man or you know, can I hide the things
[1:08:34] that I'm doing
[1:08:35] from had such a
[1:08:39] confidence and walking up to him one day
[1:08:42] and just
[1:08:43] being, you know, I'm the man or
[1:08:48] or
[1:08:50] confidence
[1:08:52] and
[1:08:53] had able to put that confidence that was
[1:08:56] that that that that God needed inside of
[1:08:59] Abraham. Another portion of scripture I
[1:09:01] like there concerning Abraham was James
[1:09:04] 2 and 22. And you know we know that
[1:09:07] Abraham, you know that there was a lot
[1:09:09] of there was a lot of that in between
[1:09:11] time that that that we don't know about
[1:09:14] that God had fellowship with Abraham's
[1:09:17] here in the 22nd verse. Seeing or seeest
[1:09:21] thou how faith wrought with his works
[1:09:24] and by works was faith made perfect. And
[1:09:27] the scriptures was fulfilled which saith
[1:09:30] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:09:32] unto him for righteousness and he was
[1:09:35] called the friend of God. Now think
[1:09:38] about this folks. You got a mortal
[1:09:39] being. You got a mortal being you know
[1:09:42] that that you know slept in slept in you
[1:09:44] know sleeps like you sleeps eat like you
[1:09:46] you eat no doubt had problems in in in
[1:09:49] in in shapes of life that you do but yet
[1:09:53] God calls him a friend. And to be able
[1:09:55] to have that pinned on your shirt would
[1:09:57] be a big deal. You know, that that that
[1:10:00] Abraham is a friend of God. And and
[1:10:02] there's nothing that we could do to be a
[1:10:04] besides acknowledge the fact that he had
[1:10:07] had fellowship with God. And I think
[1:10:09] that that's what we're trying to say
[1:10:11] here this morning is that God's not not
[1:10:14] wanting to live just up above us and
[1:10:16] look down on us and and and just merely
[1:10:19] merely uh talk to us through his
[1:10:21] attributes and and talk to us through
[1:10:24] through just oh I'm just going to send
[1:10:25] you a blessing and we can just sit here
[1:10:27] and be like oh that you know that you
[1:10:29] know I got a new car or you know I
[1:10:30] finally got you know I got a I got paid
[1:10:33] or I got this you know or or or you know
[1:10:36] whatever I got a new dress and God's
[1:10:38] blessings were upon me. You know,
[1:10:40] sometimes God's, you know, the things
[1:10:41] that we go through in life is just as
[1:10:44] much fellowship as it is the good things
[1:10:46] that we go through in life. We don't
[1:10:47] like we don't like going through bad
[1:10:49] things in our life, but yet, you know,
[1:10:51] it's just part of it. You know, that
[1:10:53] there's death. There's, you know,
[1:10:54] there's there's times where you have you
[1:10:56] have spats back and forth with friends
[1:10:58] or you have these different things, but
[1:11:00] but God has these things these these
[1:11:02] parts in in in life where when you seek
[1:11:05] or when you have fellowship with God
[1:11:07] that that you re you realize that he's
[1:11:10] there just as much in the good times or
[1:11:12] just as much in the bad times as he's
[1:11:14] there in the good times. And we got to
[1:11:16] recognize God is just as much as he's a
[1:11:18] provider. He's a comforter. and and that
[1:11:21] we got to be able to see that that God's
[1:11:23] not just living above us, looking down
[1:11:25] on us, but he wants to he wants to
[1:11:27] fellowship through us. And that and
[1:11:29] that's the thing that we we must be able
[1:11:31] to to look at when we talk about divine
[1:11:34] fellowship is the fact that that we were
[1:11:37] separated from God. And that was the
[1:11:39] thing was was whether we whether we like
[1:11:41] it or not. You know, every one of us,
[1:11:43] you know, you some of you might be able
[1:11:45] to point at your sins are greater than
[1:11:47] this person's sins or those person's
[1:11:49] sins are greater than that person's
[1:11:51] sins, but it doesn't matter because it's
[1:11:53] it's the little foxes that spoil the
[1:11:55] vine. It's the little things in our in
[1:11:57] our lives that that the little sins, the
[1:12:00] little little things that that we deny,
[1:12:03] you know, that that God is able that,
[1:12:05] you know, he's able to help us in the
[1:12:07] time of our need and where he's able to
[1:12:08] to be able to look look at look at our
[1:12:11] situation and be compassionate, you
[1:12:13] know, but but it's those kinds of
[1:12:15] things. It's the sin that separated us.
[1:12:18] And we know that we know that the
[1:12:19] fellowship with mortal man, you know, is
[1:12:22] a great thing to have, but it's not the
[1:12:24] fulfillment in our lives. You know, it's
[1:12:27] not something because you know what? You
[1:12:29] know what? You could be looking at your
[1:12:30] beautiful wife one day and the next day
[1:12:32] the Lord take her home. You know, or or
[1:12:34] or you could be looking at your husband
[1:12:36] one day and the next and the next day he
[1:12:38] take you home. You could have friends
[1:12:40] you a lot of us can probably raise raise
[1:12:42] our hands about all of the of all of the
[1:12:46] of all the friends that we have had you
[1:12:48] know in our lives and the and good
[1:12:49] friends close friends and and during
[1:12:52] that relationship that you had with with
[1:12:54] your friends you could sit here and say
[1:12:55] oh you know I I you know this is the
[1:12:57] best thing that has ever happened this
[1:12:59] is the best thing that you know the best
[1:13:01] thing that's ever happened to me and you
[1:13:02] could just be living in an aura of good
[1:13:04] times but yet this world that we live in
[1:13:07] is just toppsy and tury And you know
[1:13:09] it's up and down and you got friends
[1:13:11] today and you got you got and no friends
[1:13:13] tomorrow but yet Jesus it is sticks
[1:13:16] closer than a brother and and that
[1:13:18] that's the thing is is is that you have
[1:13:20] God being you have God that wants to be
[1:13:23] able to try to fill in the gaps in your
[1:13:25] life where your friends can't where your
[1:13:27] friends can't necessarily there's
[1:13:29] something still missing in your life and
[1:13:31] there's something still calling you to
[1:13:33] something else. That's where God comes
[1:13:35] in. And that's where God is like, "Hey,"
[1:13:37] he was like, "Hey, you need to come a
[1:13:39] little higher than more than just some
[1:13:41] type of than some type of just earthly
[1:13:45] fellowship that you have here with your
[1:13:47] friends. But yet, but yet I'm desiring
[1:13:50] to draw you up a little bit further and
[1:13:52] I'm desiring you to just come and and
[1:13:54] come a little bit closer into a
[1:13:56] fellowship where it it it produces a
[1:13:59] peace that passes all understanding."
[1:14:01] And and that's where we that's where we
[1:14:03] want to be today. And that's where I,
[1:14:05] you know, looking looking at the message
[1:14:07] of the hour that that you know that we
[1:14:09] believe is the fact that God has been
[1:14:12] throughout this entire time trying to
[1:14:15] restore fellowship. It's not you running
[1:14:17] after God. You It's not you coming out,
[1:14:20] but it's God searching you out. And
[1:14:22] that's why a lot of us are here here
[1:14:23] this morning. The thing is is we all
[1:14:25] come from different walks of life. And
[1:14:27] we all come from different different uh
[1:14:29] different states and different born in
[1:14:31] different places, but yet we're here in
[1:14:33] a church building here this evening. And
[1:14:36] you know, it's not me making Brother
[1:14:37] John come. It's not me making Brother
[1:14:39] Joe come, but yet there's something
[1:14:41] that's drawing these brothers and these
[1:14:43] sisters to fellowship with him. And
[1:14:46] that's the thing that we're after here
[1:14:47] this evening is is is the world bases
[1:14:50] everything upon this materialistic life
[1:14:52] that we live in. But yet they have 10
[1:14:54] years down the road they have nothing to
[1:14:56] go back to because because all of it has
[1:14:59] fallen apart. You know, all of it has
[1:15:00] has crumbled. But yet God's called us
[1:15:03] up. And the thing is is is we didn't
[1:15:06] know which way to turn because we
[1:15:07] thought fellowship was when it maybe in
[1:15:09] denomination or we thought fellowship
[1:15:11] might be, you know, with a certain
[1:15:13] preacher. We thought we thought
[1:15:14] fellowship was with would be through a
[1:15:17] certain group. And let me tell you
[1:15:18] something, you're not going to be able
[1:15:19] to you're not going to be able to join a
[1:15:21] church. You're not going to be able to
[1:15:23] follow follow a minister. You're not
[1:15:24] going to be able to follow a group of
[1:15:26] people and have that fulfillment in your
[1:15:29] life outside of Jesus Christ. And the
[1:15:32] only way that you're going to be able to
[1:15:34] find Jesus Christ is being able to f to
[1:15:37] be able to follow the message for your
[1:15:40] day. And that's the thing is is we were
[1:15:42] the thing is is God God so seen fit that
[1:15:46] it was your time to have divine
[1:15:48] fellowship with him that he sent a
[1:15:50] message. And that was the thing is he
[1:15:52] sent a message and he sent a prophet out
[1:15:55] to for us to be able to look and to
[1:15:58] study and to observe. And the thing was
[1:16:00] is the the thing was is the message is
[1:16:02] not here to uplift a man. The message is
[1:16:05] not up here uh to uplift the attributes
[1:16:07] or to tell the story of a man, but it's
[1:16:10] here to lift up God inside of a vessel.
[1:16:13] And that's where God's trying to get is
[1:16:15] God's God doesn't desire to be, you
[1:16:18] know, just locked up locked up in the
[1:16:21] sky somewhere and out of fellowship with
[1:16:23] his people. But he's tried for years and
[1:16:26] he and he sent you blessings and he sent
[1:16:28] messages and he sent his word to be
[1:16:30] able, but now he's busting. He's busting
[1:16:33] at the seams to be able to be inside of
[1:16:37] a vessel, inside of a inside of a living
[1:16:40] vessel. And and and you think about this
[1:16:43] and and and I got a quote here that that
[1:16:45] I love is we got to be able to see
[1:16:48] ourselves outside or uh we got to be
[1:16:51] able to see ourselves not from not
[1:16:54] outside the box because we look at
[1:16:56] ourselves and we look at our hands and
[1:16:58] we look at our feet and we know the
[1:17:00] things that we think and we know the
[1:17:02] things that we've said and the and might
[1:17:04] have been might have hurt somebody or we
[1:17:06] might have we might have uh done
[1:17:08] something you know uh and it bring shame
[1:17:11] unto your spirit. But yet God says that
[1:17:14] the only way through fellowship is
[1:17:16] through the blood of Jesus Christ. And
[1:17:19] we and the only after that we have
[1:17:21] accepted his blood that we come into
[1:17:23] divine fellowship. There's no other way.
[1:17:25] You're not going to be able to walk in
[1:17:27] and say, "Oh, well, I'm the best
[1:17:28] preacher." Oh, I'm the best singer. Oh,
[1:17:30] I'm, you know, I'm the I'm the best
[1:17:32] musician that's out here. God doesn't
[1:17:34] God doesn't look at those kinds of
[1:17:35] things. He took a sheep boy, you know, a
[1:17:37] shepherd boy and went and played music
[1:17:39] in front of a king and was able to to,
[1:17:42] you know, uh, disperse spirits out of
[1:17:43] it. But God is wanting to live and
[1:17:46] breathe through through hands and feet
[1:17:48] here today. And I was looking at this
[1:17:50] quote uh I was looking at this quote and
[1:17:52] I liked it. It seemed to it seemed to
[1:17:54] kind of really speak out to me. But it
[1:17:56] says here now not upon the basis of the
[1:17:59] Baptist or Pentecostal church or any
[1:18:01] other church upon the basis uh the basis
[1:18:04] of the water baptism although those are
[1:18:06] good it's all right but not upon the
[1:18:08] basis of water baptism not upon the
[1:18:11] basis of a church or joining a church
[1:18:13] that's all good but it's upon the basis
[1:18:15] of the shed blood you might have
[1:18:18] fellowship with a church and or a
[1:18:20] congregation but you'll never have
[1:18:23] fellowship with God till you come come
[1:18:25] on his basis, his
[1:18:27] terms or his terms is through the blood.
[1:18:31] But a man has a soul and therefore that
[1:18:33] soul is part of God and even it's even
[1:18:36] in its fallen state. Now, this is where
[1:18:38] I like it and it's where it starts to
[1:18:40] get good. I'm going to repeat this. But
[1:18:42] as but a man has a soul and therefore
[1:18:44] that soul is a part of God and even in
[1:18:47] its fallen state yet it it is the most
[1:18:50] greatest species of all species on
[1:18:53] earth. It is the man. And then him
[1:18:56] connecting with his maker. Now that's
[1:18:59] where it's at. Now that that's the part
[1:19:01] where we don't feel like we can make
[1:19:03] happen, but him connecting with his
[1:19:06] maker.
[1:19:08] He becomes a superman almost because
[1:19:11] he's a son of God. Now that's the
[1:19:13] mentality that we have to look at
[1:19:15] ourselves in is is that that that is
[1:19:17] that that we're not just just normal
[1:19:19] here on earth. Now there are
[1:19:21] some people that are just normal
[1:19:23] I'm going to put that on
[1:19:24] there. You know, there are some people
[1:19:26] that are just people that are out here
[1:19:28] on earth, but you're not that people.
[1:19:30] Amen. You're not the people that's to be
[1:19:32] out here that's just that's to live
[1:19:34] nonchalantly inside of inside of the
[1:19:36] church and just go and just just expect,
[1:19:38] you know, a preacher to be preaching a
[1:19:40] song to be sung. But you're the group of
[1:19:42] people that comes and can divinely have
[1:19:44] fellowship with God. That when you sing
[1:19:46] these songs, it's a sweet smelling
[1:19:48] savior. When you give your life to the
[1:19:50] Lord, it's God jumping up and down and
[1:19:52] saying, "That's right. Another one has
[1:19:54] come home."
[1:19:58] It says, "But man has a soul and
[1:20:00] therefore or uh yeah, so there but a man
[1:20:03] has a soul and therefore that soul is a
[1:20:06] part of God. And even in its fallen
[1:20:09] state, it is the most greatest species
[1:20:11] of all of all species on earth. It is a
[1:20:13] man and get him in con in connection
[1:20:16] with his maker. He becomes a superman
[1:20:18] almost he because he is a son of God. He
[1:20:21] becomes acquainted with his maker with
[1:20:24] the creator of all things. And then when
[1:20:28] and then when that man there is
[1:20:30] acquainted with his maker he becomes a
[1:20:32] part of his maker. He becomes back into
[1:20:35] fellowship with his maker. Every divine
[1:20:38] word becomes a living reality and and he
[1:20:42] believes it. And that's where God's
[1:20:44] desire is to be here this evening is
[1:20:46] that every divine word that's been
[1:20:48] spoken becomes a living reality to us in
[1:20:51] our lives. God desires fellowship. Not
[1:20:54] not not not the kind of fellowship
[1:20:56] that's just like, "Oh Lord, lay me down
[1:20:57] to sleep, you know, and I just say a
[1:20:59] good prayer." That's not fellowship, you
[1:21:01] know. I mean, when when we come to a
[1:21:03] place, yes, we come in here and we sing
[1:21:05] songs and and and we do and you know,
[1:21:07] and we listen to the minister or we
[1:21:09] might play a tape or but we're talking
[1:21:11] about that kind of fellowship that David
[1:21:14] had with God, that Abraham had with God.
[1:21:16] It wasn't just no, lay me down to sleep.
[1:21:18] But I could just imagine, you know, as
[1:21:20] Abraham or or as David, you know, and I
[1:21:23] like using David because, you know, he's
[1:21:25] one of my favorite characters of the
[1:21:27] Bible. But I I could just figure him,
[1:21:29] you know, sitting down upon a rock
[1:21:31] somewhere, the sheep, he's already he's
[1:21:33] already counted all the sheep and he
[1:21:35] knows that all them all of them are
[1:21:37] there. But I could just imagine as David
[1:21:39] is sitting upon a rock somewhere and and
[1:21:41] he's listening, he's listening for the
[1:21:43] voice of the Lord, playing his
[1:21:45] instruments. And there's where, you
[1:21:46] know, sometimes I envy you. you you guys
[1:21:48] that play instruments, I couldn't, you
[1:21:50] know, Brother Windows tried. I I can't
[1:21:51] play no instrument, you know, and and
[1:21:54] you know, I can't I can't even sing, let
[1:21:56] alone play an instrument, you know, and
[1:21:58] and and and and I could just imagine,
[1:22:00] you know, David being out there and and
[1:22:02] and being out there and singing before
[1:22:05] the Lord. And and the thing is is is you
[1:22:07] you think you think that you have to
[1:22:09] have all your ducks in a row in order to
[1:22:11] have fellowship with God, but God just
[1:22:13] wants you.
[1:22:14] God just wants the raw you. God just
[1:22:16] wants the you that's sitting in your car
[1:22:19] and a and all you don't know what to
[1:22:21] say. You don't know what to you don't
[1:22:22] know what to do. But yet there a
[1:22:24] presence that comes over you in his car,
[1:22:26] you know, and it's kind of like when a
[1:22:28] friend calls you, you know, you you get
[1:22:30] a you get a text or you get a call from
[1:22:32] a friend and and if you're not
[1:22:34] careful, don't say you don't do it
[1:22:36] because you're people just like
[1:22:39] me. But you you're like, "Oh, so and
[1:22:41] so's calling. I'll call them back."
[1:22:45] you know, and you're just like click,
[1:22:46] you know, and and you know what? I I
[1:22:48] think sometimes if we're not careful,
[1:22:50] that's the way we are with the Lord.
[1:22:52] That when the Lord's spirit comes upon
[1:22:54] you in the car or the Lord's spirit
[1:22:57] comes upon you ladies when you're
[1:22:58] washing dishes or you're doing laundry,
[1:23:00] when the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:23:01] you, you know, you men when you're
[1:23:03] working or or or or or you're doing
[1:23:06] things in your life that you feel that
[1:23:08] uncction and it's an uncction that you
[1:23:10] know the neighbor next to you doesn't
[1:23:12] feel is because the reason is is because
[1:23:14] God wants fellowship with you. He
[1:23:17] doesn't want fellowship with your
[1:23:18] neighbor. He doesn't want fellowship
[1:23:20] with just your because your pastor's not
[1:23:22] there at that moment. He doesn't want
[1:23:23] fellowship with me. But he wants he
[1:23:25] wants fellowship with you. And I think
[1:23:27] what it happens is if we're not careful,
[1:23:29] we begin to push that uncction off.
[1:23:31] Well, I'll do that when I get into
[1:23:32] church the next time or I'll do that
[1:23:34] when I get into, you know, I'm going to
[1:23:36] read my Bible and that's what I want to
[1:23:37] know. God wants to know how you're doing
[1:23:39] in church and he wants to know how
[1:23:40] you're doing out of church. He wants to
[1:23:42] know that you're Sometimes we just sit
[1:23:44] here and we're like, "Oh, God can read
[1:23:46] my thoughts and God can do this and God
[1:23:48] and and sometimes we're that way with
[1:23:49] friends. Sometimes we're that way with
[1:23:51] our spouse. Sometimes we're we're that
[1:23:53] way, you know, just like, "Oh, my wife
[1:23:55] should know exactly what I'm going
[1:23:56] through because I'm showing up with a
[1:23:57] mad face.
[1:24:01] My wife should be able to read my mind."
[1:24:03] Or or sometimes, you know, the wives,
[1:24:05] you know, I I I know you guys are all
[1:24:07] angels, but I'm just going to put it out
[1:24:08] there. You know, and you know, sometimes
[1:24:10] you wives have got your things going on
[1:24:11] and they're like, "Well, my husband
[1:24:13] should know because of this." No,
[1:24:15] sometimes you just got to tell your wife
[1:24:16] and sometimes you just got to tell your
[1:24:18] husband. And sometimes God just wants
[1:24:20] you to walk up to him and say, "Lord,
[1:24:22] I'm having this issue. Lord, I I'm going
[1:24:26] through this. I'm struggling with this
[1:24:27] in my life. I'm Lord. I I I've been I've
[1:24:30] been trying to get caugh I just can't
[1:24:32] seem to be able to get into a quiet
[1:24:33] place or where I can sit and I and I can
[1:24:36] have fellowship with you and and I can
[1:24:38] and I can talk to you like David talked
[1:24:40] and and and sometimes you know what it's
[1:24:42] like to really have fellowship because
[1:24:44] after you have fellowship, you've
[1:24:46] emptied out and you're you're free.
[1:24:48] You're free in your spirit. You're free
[1:24:50] and and and you know all these things
[1:24:52] that you the thoughts that you might
[1:24:53] have had towards your brother, the
[1:24:55] thoughts that you might have had. Oh,
[1:24:57] that things should be ran this way.
[1:24:58] Things should be ran that way. But but
[1:25:00] yeah, all that stuff just absolutely
[1:25:02] means a hill of beans at the end of the
[1:25:04] at the end of your meeting with God
[1:25:06] because the only thing that it's because
[1:25:08] you're fulfilled through this divine
[1:25:10] fellowship and God's willing and he's
[1:25:13] wanting and he and he's waiting through
[1:25:15] the word. And that's what it is is is
[1:25:17] the message of the hour is calling out
[1:25:19] sons and daughters of God. He's calling
[1:25:21] out people that are bone of his bone and
[1:25:23] flesh of his flesh. That's why God put
[1:25:26] these people like Enoch and David and
[1:25:28] Abraham inside of there is to is to make
[1:25:30] you realize that you can have this same
[1:25:33] type of fellowship with him. A place
[1:25:35] where you can get alone with God and you
[1:25:37] can talk to him. That's not just left
[1:25:38] for the prophet. That's just not left
[1:25:40] for people that were left back in the,
[1:25:42] you know, the 30s and the 40s and and
[1:25:44] you know, different different places
[1:25:45] like that. But he's desiring a walk with
[1:25:48] you. And you know, sometimes it takes us
[1:25:50] being able to just break off, you know,
[1:25:52] break off the the the the daily duties.
[1:25:55] And sometimes it it's something that we
[1:25:57] have to be able to do. You don't don't
[1:25:58] be scared to be able to lock yourself
[1:26:00] away in a place and be like, "God, you
[1:26:02] know what? I've heard from all my other
[1:26:04] earthly friends and I I appreciate all
[1:26:06] these things that you've given me and I
[1:26:08] appreciate the roof over my head and I
[1:26:10] appreciate the food that you've put on
[1:26:13] my table and I appreciate the car that I
[1:26:15] drive but but Lord without you I would
[1:26:18] have nothing Lord without you I I you
[1:26:21] know I can't breathe. I can't think. I
[1:26:23] can't I can't speak, you know. And you
[1:26:25] go back and you listen to the Psalms of
[1:26:27] David, you know, and you could see him
[1:26:29] bleeding through the words that that he
[1:26:32] speaks, you know. And that's the thing
[1:26:34] about God is he's looking for for
[1:26:36] compassion. He's looking for he's
[1:26:38] looking for you to speak to you to speak
[1:26:41] to him through your heart and and be
[1:26:44] able to lay these things out before him.
[1:26:46] He's he's got you know, God is sick and
[1:26:48] tired. That's why he was like, that's
[1:26:49] like all your offerings and all your
[1:26:51] traditions, these things are just
[1:26:53] stinking stink to my nose. These things
[1:26:56] are is because we can if we're not
[1:26:57] careful, we we come and we offer God
[1:27:00] what we have left.
[1:27:03] you know, you know, goes back and, you
[1:27:05] know, the story where where Jesus was
[1:27:07] where Jesus had come and and he had and
[1:27:09] he had uh he was pulling I believe it
[1:27:11] was like an offering or it and and all
[1:27:14] these and he was sitting there with the
[1:27:16] people and his disciples were there and
[1:27:18] and you could see where all of the all
[1:27:20] of the rich men had come in and and and
[1:27:23] all all the men had come in and they
[1:27:25] were donating to the church, you know,
[1:27:26] they were they were putting money there
[1:27:28] in the in the box, you know, and he was
[1:27:31] speaking to his disciples And he was
[1:27:33] like, "All these people, they they gave
[1:27:34] out of their
[1:27:36] ability. They gave out of they gave out
[1:27:38] of their free time. They gave out of
[1:27:40] their, you know, that, you know, they
[1:27:41] had $100,000, you know, and they were
[1:27:44] able to give 20,000 because they just
[1:27:45] had it to spare, you know." But there
[1:27:47] was one lady that came with a
[1:27:49] might, you know, and that one lady, she
[1:27:52] came with she came with the
[1:27:54] might. And God was like, God was like,
[1:27:57] "That lady is going to be a
[1:28:00] memorial because she gave out of her
[1:28:03] necessity." And that's the thing is is
[1:28:07] God wants to know that you love him. God
[1:28:10] wants to know that you want a real
[1:28:12] divine fellowship. See, and that's the
[1:28:13] way it is sometimes here in the natural.
[1:28:16] You know, you know, when somebody could
[1:28:17] give when they when they give and you
[1:28:19] know, if they got money, you know, it's
[1:28:21] like, "Oh, they gave, you know, because
[1:28:22] they had it to give." But it's
[1:28:24] different. It's different when you know
[1:28:27] that somebody has
[1:28:29] sacrificed to give to you so that you're
[1:28:32] able to go. And I think God sits there
[1:28:34] and he looks at your sacrifice. That's
[1:28:37] why they call it a sacrifice of praise.
[1:28:39] We just don't like to sacrifice. And
[1:28:42] it's just what it is. you know, we're
[1:28:43] American and it's our right to have this
[1:28:45] and it's our right to have that and we
[1:28:47] should have a a new house and we should
[1:28:49] have air conditioning and we should have
[1:28:50] cars and we should have, you know, all
[1:28:52] these different things and, you know,
[1:28:54] and that's the way that we get with God
[1:28:55] is, you know, that we should have your
[1:28:57] presence down here. We should have your
[1:28:59] this, we should have your that, but yet
[1:29:01] God's looking for a sacrifice to be that
[1:29:04] comes from us, you know, to him, you
[1:29:07] know, and and sometimes that's what it
[1:29:08] is when you have to get down on your
[1:29:10] knees and say, "Lord, I I, you know, I I
[1:29:12] I don't have what it takes to be able to
[1:29:15] come into your presence, Lord. I need
[1:29:16] you to wash me. I need you to cleanse
[1:29:19] me. I need you to Lord, just to be able
[1:29:21] to take me, Lord, to a place. And the
[1:29:23] thing is is he desires fellowship
[1:29:25] because he's wanting to express himself
[1:29:28] through you. He's wanting to express
[1:29:29] himself through his sons and his
[1:29:31] daughters. And and when you come into
[1:29:33] that place with in God's presence,
[1:29:36] there's nothing that can interfere with
[1:29:38] you. You might be having job troubles.
[1:29:40] You might be having, you know, troubles
[1:29:41] with with with your brother or your
[1:29:43] sister or you might be having troubles
[1:29:44] in your family. But all these things
[1:29:46] begin to dissipate because you at that
[1:29:49] moment become the master of your
[1:29:51] circumstance. And it's God. It's the
[1:29:54] creator and the creation coming
[1:29:56] together. And you begin to believe when
[1:29:58] God tells you that he's able to provide.
[1:30:01] You begin to believe when God tells you,
[1:30:03] you know, that he's going to cause peace
[1:30:05] in the middle of your storm. And that's
[1:30:07] where it's at is when you when when the
[1:30:09] creation and the creator meet, the
[1:30:11] divine fellowship takes place. And what
[1:30:14] we see today is is that we we lose we're
[1:30:17] losing the ability of this divine
[1:30:19] fellowship because because we want form
[1:30:22] and we want to be able to just come to
[1:30:23] church and just be able to sit under,
[1:30:25] you know, a good ministry and we want to
[1:30:27] be able to come and sit underneath a
[1:30:29] good song leader, musicians, and we want
[1:30:31] to be here be like, "God, here I am."
[1:30:33] That's not fellowship. When you come and
[1:30:34] you fellowship with your friends, it's
[1:30:36] not how you act. But yet, when we come
[1:30:38] to God, it's it's God's wanting to
[1:30:40] fulfill and to re reunite you of who you
[1:30:43] really are. I begin to think about just
[1:30:46] a few a few scriptures or a few uh
[1:30:49] quotes here this
[1:30:51] evening or this morning
[1:30:54] actually. It says, "That's the reason we
[1:30:56] was commissioned to baptize you in the
[1:30:58] name of the father, son, and the holy
[1:30:59] ghost." showing showing that God was
[1:31:02] unfolded unfolded himself condescending
[1:31:05] coming down working his way through. He
[1:31:08] couldn't enter into sin but he cleared
[1:31:11] his way as he went for God so loved man
[1:31:14] that he wants to come down and
[1:31:16] fellowship with him. God tonight the
[1:31:19] same Jehovah God that spoke to Adam and
[1:31:22] Eve in the garden of of Eden lives in
[1:31:24] every born again man or woman trying
[1:31:26] trying his best to make you believe him.
[1:31:29] Have faith in him. Step out. Don't you
[1:31:31] don't you doubt it one bit. But the same
[1:31:33] God that was with Abraham is is the same
[1:31:36] God here tonight desiring fellowship.
[1:31:38] Now, the thing is is I was thinking
[1:31:40] about how that you had the slave man
[1:31:42] that had the slave uh the young slave
[1:31:46] boy that was in back in the day. this
[1:31:48] there was a man that had come out and he
[1:31:50] was looking for a slave to buy and he he
[1:31:53] had come to this field here and and he
[1:31:55] was looking and he picked a slave and he
[1:31:57] noticed that this slave man was you know
[1:31:59] he was just a real happy guy and we all
[1:32:01] know the story but he was just a real
[1:32:03] happy guy and he had and he had noticed
[1:32:05] that you know that he was more jolly in
[1:32:07] his step that you didn't have to whip
[1:32:09] him you didn't have to do different
[1:32:10] things so the man went to the owner and
[1:32:12] was like hey you know I'd like to buy
[1:32:14] this or this man right here and and he
[1:32:16] said well that slave's not for And he
[1:32:18] was like, "Well, I've noticed that
[1:32:19] there's something different about him.
[1:32:21] You know, I noticed that there's
[1:32:22] something is it do you feed him
[1:32:24] different or do you not whip him or does
[1:32:26] he get special privileges?" And and the
[1:32:28] man was like, "No, that's not the case.
[1:32:30] We're not uh uh it's not uh that's not
[1:32:32] the case at all. You know, he he eats
[1:32:35] down there in the GS. I treat him just
[1:32:37] the same as as any other any of the
[1:32:40] other slaves." He's like, "But I I had
[1:32:41] asked the question myself and so I did a
[1:32:44] little bit of researching and and he
[1:32:45] said, "But what I had found out was that
[1:32:47] in that in another country that he was
[1:32:49] the son of the king and even though that
[1:32:52] he's in way away in a different land
[1:32:54] across the ocean that he still conducts
[1:32:57] himself as a son of the king and and I
[1:32:59] really love that story because, you
[1:33:00] know, we're from a far away country, you
[1:33:03] know, and and and that's the kind of
[1:33:05] mentality we have to we we need to, you
[1:33:08] know, put ourselves in when we approach
[1:33:10] God that you're not just the normal
[1:33:12] average Joe, but but you're the
[1:33:14] purchased. You're the redeemed of God
[1:33:16] and God has invested heavily into our
[1:33:19] lives and and looking at this that yes,
[1:33:21] you have the ability to talk oneon-one
[1:33:24] with God. That's your father and you're
[1:33:26] his son and he's your his daughter and
[1:33:29] and be able to come to a place where
[1:33:31] where every situation that we go through
[1:33:33] in our life isn't just a isn't a
[1:33:35] downhill slide, but you know that you're
[1:33:37] in the arms of the creator. and hear
[1:33:39] this evening that every person in here
[1:33:41] that's under the sound of this message
[1:33:44] is is coming to their fruition through
[1:33:46] the fellowship of God. But first of all,
[1:33:48] you have to act out all the sin. You
[1:33:51] have to take out you have to take out
[1:33:53] all these little things that are in your
[1:33:54] life to be able to to put to be able to
[1:33:57] open a space with God to be able to
[1:33:59] sacrifice your life to be able to
[1:34:01] sacrifice your time that you can come
[1:34:04] and you can have fellowship with him.
[1:34:06] And and that's the thing here this
[1:34:07] evening or this morning is is being able
[1:34:10] to put ourselves into a place that we
[1:34:12] could fellowship with the almighty God.
[1:34:14] But we have to have a change in mindset
[1:34:17] in order to come to in order to come
[1:34:19] before the Lord and and for him to have
[1:34:21] fellowship one-on-one with with us as as
[1:34:24] the creator because God's just not
[1:34:26] sitting, you know, up where up
[1:34:28] somewhere, but he's sitting beside you
[1:34:30] and he's talking with you and all of us
[1:34:33] know, you know, any son and daughter of
[1:34:35] God can realize that that hey, that
[1:34:37] there's something different about me
[1:34:38] that there's that there's a a calling as
[1:34:41] I love how the the scripture says it's a
[1:34:43] deep calling to the deep and there's
[1:34:45] something within us that is desiring to
[1:34:48] respond with uh to God and be able to
[1:34:51] desire that fellowship. But there's when
[1:34:53] there's something in us to do it, I
[1:34:55] advise you just take advantage of that
[1:34:57] moment because God's not desiring just a
[1:35:00] just a a you know a church that's just
[1:35:02] formal. God's not desiring a church that
[1:35:05] that you can you can just come to and
[1:35:07] then you just all you sing your songs.
[1:35:09] But but he desires unity and he desires
[1:35:12] fellowship with his creator. Now another
[1:35:15] thing is we can break this word up into
[1:35:18] a lot of different things. Fellowship
[1:35:19] has a lot of things. It's harmony, unity
[1:35:22] and agreement and we have these things
[1:35:24] and that's where we need to have our
[1:35:26] place with the Lord is having unity with
[1:35:28] him. Being able to take him at his word
[1:35:30] and not not just single ourselves away.
[1:35:34] And if we're not careful, we begin to
[1:35:35] look at scripture and we're just like,
[1:35:37] "Oh, well, that just must be for the
[1:35:38] preacher." Or, "Oh, that just must be
[1:35:40] for the brother or sister that's out
[1:35:42] there." But, but being able to come to a
[1:35:44] place to uh to where we accept the word
[1:35:46] for ourselves, being able to because,
[1:35:48] you know, really the word is is is a is
[1:35:51] our code of conduct. It's a place that
[1:35:53] it's something that we can use to be
[1:35:55] able to strengthen our daily lives. When
[1:35:57] he says that when he says that you are
[1:35:59] an overcomer, you must believe that.
[1:36:02] being able to be in fellowship with him
[1:36:04] and believe that you are an overcomer
[1:36:06] that you can overcome. You know, whether
[1:36:08] it's physical illness in your life or
[1:36:10] whether it's spiritual, something that
[1:36:12] you might be just going through, but you
[1:36:14] can able you can look into the word and
[1:36:15] say, you know what, this is for me. You
[1:36:17] know, the the the the scriptures that
[1:36:19] God has written down has written for us,
[1:36:22] the message has come to shine light on
[1:36:25] there that you're not just an observer,
[1:36:27] but you're the one that's actually
[1:36:28] playing in the game. You're the one
[1:36:30] that's here. You're the one that's God's
[1:36:32] in God's great arena. And he's you're
[1:36:35] the one that he's using to shine his
[1:36:37] light into Pawnie, Oklahoma or where
[1:36:40] Fairfax, Oklahoma or wherever parts of
[1:36:43] parts of the world that you might be in
[1:36:45] that you're not just a spectator in
[1:36:47] God's game, but yet you're the one that
[1:36:49] he needs. You're the tools that God's
[1:36:51] using to express himself, his attributes
[1:36:55] to the world that we live in. The only
[1:36:57] way that we can express these attributes
[1:37:00] is through God's word and to have
[1:37:02] fellowship in God's word. Any success
[1:37:04] that you're going to have in your
[1:37:06] Christian walk is not going to be just
[1:37:08] by just memorizing some quotes and just
[1:37:10] memorizing some scriptures, but you must
[1:37:12] be become one with that life with you
[1:37:16] must become one with with the Lord. You
[1:37:19] must become one. I I can't be one with
[1:37:21] my neighbor. I can't be one, you know,
[1:37:23] with somebody that, you know, with just
[1:37:25] a human here on earth. They didn't die
[1:37:26] for me. They didn't save me, you know,
[1:37:28] and they're not going to be the one that
[1:37:30] I go to see when I get to heaven, but
[1:37:31] they're going to be but it must be that
[1:37:33] fellowship with the Lord one-on-one to
[1:37:35] where we can see where God can trust us,
[1:37:38] you know. And that was the thing with
[1:37:39] Job is when is when God was speaking of
[1:37:42] Job, you know, God had faith. God had
[1:37:44] trust in what Job was going to do.
[1:37:46] Therefore, he could allow the devil to
[1:37:48] tempt him. You know, we all know the
[1:37:50] story about how the scriptures go and
[1:37:51] and how that Job was was, you know, Job
[1:37:54] was just minding his own business and
[1:37:55] then all of a sudden God and Satan were
[1:37:58] beginning to have a conference about Job
[1:38:00] and about how that, you know, uh uh you
[1:38:02] know, Job is prospering and Job is this
[1:38:05] and you know, he's got cattle and he's
[1:38:07] got children and he sacrifices for his
[1:38:10] children daily and he has all these
[1:38:12] things, you know, but yet at the same
[1:38:14] time, Satan kept proddding at at the
[1:38:17] Lord at Job and being like, "Well, He's
[1:38:19] only this way because of this. He's only
[1:38:21] this way because of that. And he's only
[1:38:23] this way because you have a hedge over
[1:38:25] him. Or he's only this way because, you
[1:38:27] know, but you let me take his life. You
[1:38:30] know, you you let me take it. You let me
[1:38:32] come and you let me come upon him with,
[1:38:34] you know, with sickness and I'll make
[1:38:35] you curse him to his face. And God had
[1:38:37] so much confidence in Job. It wasn't
[1:38:40] because of all the knowledge that Job
[1:38:41] had, but that Job had a one-on-one
[1:38:43] relationship with the Lord that that
[1:38:45] that was able to give God confidence in
[1:38:48] knowing where he would react because he
[1:38:50] would react the same way God would react
[1:38:52] because he abided by his word. And the
[1:38:54] only way to know who God is, to be able
[1:38:57] to put God into a physical form would be
[1:39:00] by his scripture. And that's the thing
[1:39:01] is is we can't put God in an invisible
[1:39:04] body somewhere off in the distance
[1:39:06] somewhere. But we got to be able to
[1:39:08] place him to where we could have
[1:39:10] fellowship with him by his word. And the
[1:39:12] only way you'll find that is not through
[1:39:14] a good seminar. It's not through
[1:39:16] necessarily just a good message, but
[1:39:18] reading the word and figuring out who
[1:39:20] God really is. God is his word. And his
[1:39:24] word is what is going to remain. And if
[1:39:26] his word remains, then God will remain.
[1:39:28] And that's where we must see God here
[1:39:30] this evening is is that he's not just
[1:39:32] far off. And he's not just not
[1:39:34] untangible to where we can't shake hands
[1:39:37] or we can't hug, where we can't, you
[1:39:39] know, we can't see. We see God. And I
[1:39:41] say God is living here today. I say God
[1:39:43] that is living right inside of this
[1:39:46] building here this evening or this
[1:39:47] morning, whether we see it or we believe
[1:39:49] it or not, but God's not just wanting to
[1:39:51] stand on the outside of the believer and
[1:39:54] just instruct us all the days of his
[1:39:56] life, but he's desiring to get inside of
[1:39:59] a body. And he's desiring that you can
[1:40:02] be your Jesus that you can express your
[1:40:05] fellowship of God through for him to
[1:40:08] this world that we live in because we
[1:40:10] know that we know where the uh that that
[1:40:12] a lot of times this world the only Bible
[1:40:14] the only message that they're going to
[1:40:16] see is you women and the way that you
[1:40:18] dress and it's preached you know the way
[1:40:20] that it's preached through your lives
[1:40:22] and you men the way that you conduct
[1:40:23] yourselves out in the world. Amen. Uh I
[1:40:27] it's the way that you live your life and
[1:40:29] it's how it's preached. Your fellowship
[1:40:31] that you have with God. You could tell,
[1:40:33] you know, it's not something that you
[1:40:35] have to, you know, you you you know, any
[1:40:37] of us believers that are here this this
[1:40:39] morning, you could tell by an
[1:40:40] individual's life how far they are with
[1:40:42] the Lord by the way and the way they
[1:40:44] dress and and the way they speak about
[1:40:46] certain situations and the and the way
[1:40:48] they do things. you could see where
[1:40:50] their fellowship is at. And and you
[1:40:52] could see in in in believers, you know,
[1:40:54] that's the one thing I I'd always
[1:40:55] appreciated about, you know, uh some of
[1:40:58] the ministers that that I've gotten to
[1:41:01] hang out with, you know, and and you
[1:41:02] could sit there and you could sit and
[1:41:04] you can listen to them as they as they
[1:41:06] as they're studying and and and they're
[1:41:08] sitting there and you would all of a
[1:41:09] sudden they would just begin to speak
[1:41:10] out, Lord, I love you, Jesus. Lord, I I
[1:41:13] appreciate you watching me throughout
[1:41:15] the day and I appreciate you, you know,
[1:41:17] keeping my family safe and and you know,
[1:41:19] and I'd just be sitting in the van with
[1:41:21] him and I'd be like, who is he talking
[1:41:22] to, you know, and I'm I'm like, who is
[1:41:25] this guy talking to? But yet he treats
[1:41:27] but he treats the Lord as he as if he's
[1:41:29] an actual person because he is, you
[1:41:32] know, God is real, you know. I mean, I I
[1:41:34] I know we don't see him physically here,
[1:41:36] but yet God is really real. That's why
[1:41:38] when you pray and things happen is
[1:41:40] because somebody is listening. You know,
[1:41:42] you got there's there's a reciprocation
[1:41:44] that's going on here. And and that's the
[1:41:46] thing is is is we have to we have to be
[1:41:48] able to see God as more than just some
[1:41:50] figment of our imagination. But we got
[1:41:52] to be able to look at the word and say,
[1:41:54] you know what, by his by my by his
[1:41:57] stripes, I'm healed. And that's where
[1:41:58] you take the scripture and said, Lord,
[1:42:00] you're the master of the wind. You're
[1:42:01] the only one that can be be able to come
[1:42:03] and meet me in the middle of my
[1:42:05] circumstance. said, "Lord, I would just
[1:42:06] ask God that you would you would make
[1:42:08] yourself real." And the thing is is we
[1:42:10] have just as much as faith and I, you
[1:42:12] know, and I ain't got no problems with
[1:42:13] it or, you know, and I know things get
[1:42:15] weird talking about this subject when it
[1:42:17] comes to doctors, but you know, we have
[1:42:18] enough faith to be able to go to a
[1:42:20] doctor, you know, and and be able to
[1:42:22] look at him and be able to prescribe
[1:42:24] these things and do these things and all
[1:42:26] the but yet we leave God to the very
[1:42:28] end, you know, right? I'm talking like
[1:42:30] right before we get to our last
[1:42:31] heartbeat. It's like, Lord, okay, now I
[1:42:33] need you. And it should God's like,
[1:42:34] "Well, I've been here this whole time.
[1:42:36] I've just been waiting." You know,
[1:42:37] because God's not going to just encroach
[1:42:39] himself upon you because he's a
[1:42:41] gentleman. God's not going to go
[1:42:42] somewhere where where he's not wanted.
[1:42:44] You know, when you're sitting in your
[1:42:45] car and you're listening to your music
[1:42:46] and God's sitting there and he's he's
[1:42:49] pricking at your heart and he's wanting
[1:42:50] you maybe to turn the music down and and
[1:42:53] a message on or maybe to turn the music
[1:42:55] down and listen to your Bible or read
[1:42:57] your Bible and but yet you're in your
[1:42:59] heart. You're just you're not desiring
[1:43:01] fellowship with the Lord. So you just
[1:43:02] turn the music on and you just push
[1:43:04] that, you just forward God's, you know,
[1:43:06] spiritual message to your heart, you
[1:43:08] know, and you're just like, "Well, Lord,
[1:43:10] you know, I'll get to you in church or
[1:43:11] I'll get you." That's not God's desire.
[1:43:13] But here this evening, what God's desire
[1:43:15] is is when he's beckoning you is his
[1:43:17] desire is for a divine fellowship. Not
[1:43:20] just songs, not just hymns, but just
[1:43:22] something that he can be able somewhere
[1:43:24] you can relate and say, "You know what,
[1:43:26] Lord? I remember when I got back into
[1:43:28] fellowship with you and and and and and
[1:43:31] and I come to your presence and I
[1:43:33] realized Lord where where I had coming
[1:43:35] off or where I had fallen off and we all
[1:43:37] come to that place where we're just not
[1:43:39] we're just not in tune with his spirit.
[1:43:41] We all get to that place. We all get a
[1:43:43] little stickery. We all get a little get
[1:43:45] to a place with the Lord and that should
[1:43:46] be our little barometer when we go off
[1:43:49] you know when we go off and so it's why
[1:43:51] am I just so why am I just so you know
[1:43:53] when it comes to this person or I'm just
[1:43:55] so you know some of you look at I know
[1:43:58] I'm probably the only one that's you
[1:44:00] know but it just happens that way but
[1:44:02] but you know we come to a place with the
[1:44:05] Lord where we're like we we get we get
[1:44:07] just upset or we we get to a place where
[1:44:10] we're waiting for the Lord to do
[1:44:11] something or we're waiting for and and
[1:44:13] all of a sudden it just seems like that
[1:44:15] dove has flown
[1:44:17] off and we come to a place where we're
[1:44:19] like, "Lord, now we need you, but we're
[1:44:21] just so stickery and we're just so
[1:44:22] prickly and we're just so, you know,
[1:44:24] because, you know, we're not been
[1:44:25] reading the word of God. We've not been
[1:44:27] listening to the message and we've not
[1:44:29] been having divine fellowship with him."
[1:44:31] It happens. And if you don't think it
[1:44:33] happens that way, it can happen just as
[1:44:35] easily with an earthly friend. Amen. You
[1:44:38] have a friend that you don't talk with.
[1:44:39] You have a friend that you don't you
[1:44:40] don't you know you haven't spoke with
[1:44:42] for three or four years and all of a
[1:44:43] sudden they call and you're like
[1:44:45] yeah how you doing? Oh, doing good.
[1:44:48] Well, that sounds good. Well, see you
[1:44:49] later. It used to be the same person
[1:44:50] that you talk to for three or four
[1:44:52] hours. And you got, you know, and you
[1:44:55] know, girls, you can listen to girls do
[1:44:56] it all the time. All they do is giggle
[1:44:58] for like three or four hours, you know,
[1:45:00] they just sit and they giggle when they
[1:45:01] talk to each other about, you know,
[1:45:02] things that are going on and stuff. And
[1:45:04] there's really not I don't even know
[1:45:05] what they're fellowshipping over,
[1:45:06] honestly. you know, but they sit but you
[1:45:09] know, they don't have to they don't have
[1:45:10] to sit there and necessarily talk about
[1:45:12] a topic, but yet they're just enjoying
[1:45:14] each other's one another's company, you
[1:45:16] know, and that and if we're not careful,
[1:45:18] that's the way we be we become with God
[1:45:20] is we don't enjoy his fellowship when
[1:45:22] his presence comes down in the services
[1:45:24] is because our hearts have become
[1:45:26] prickly and we're more informed. We're
[1:45:27] more interested about, oh, we got this
[1:45:29] job to complete down here, or oh, you
[1:45:32] know, we got we got food to cook, or oh,
[1:45:33] we got I got to contact this person, or,
[1:45:35] oh, I got to do this. And we leave Jesus
[1:45:37] with dirty feet back at the
[1:45:40] church. And that might, you know, that
[1:45:42] might be pretty interesting to think
[1:45:43] about because you're sitting here and
[1:45:44] you're thinking, well, Lord, what do you
[1:45:46] mean? I've uh, you know, I'm a, you
[1:45:47] know, I'm a song leader or a musician.
[1:45:50] I'm a minister. And you're saying that I
[1:45:51] left you with dirty feet, but yet you've
[1:45:53] not had that communion with God. Yet yet
[1:45:56] you've not had that place where you sat
[1:45:57] at your pew and you just laid it all out
[1:45:59] on the line and you're just like, "Lord,
[1:46:01] I I'm a failure here and I'm a failure
[1:46:03] there and Lord, I you know, I I I I
[1:46:06] don't know exactly what to do here in
[1:46:08] this situation." And and Lord, I I just
[1:46:10] need your presence to be able to come
[1:46:12] upon my heart. And and all of a sudden,
[1:46:14] you begin to feel the hair sticking up
[1:46:16] on your shoulders. And you begin to feel
[1:46:18] the hair starting to kind of stick up on
[1:46:19] your arms. And you realize this presence
[1:46:21] is coming near. And you know what? And
[1:46:23] you take that opportunity to be able to
[1:46:25] tell that Lord how beautiful he is. And
[1:46:27] you begin to come and you begin to tell
[1:46:29] the Lord how much you appreciate him
[1:46:31] keeping your family and and keeping your
[1:46:33] daughters and your sons and providing a
[1:46:36] roof over your head. And it's that kind
[1:46:38] of fellowship that God just stops what
[1:46:39] he's doing in heaven. He begins to walk
[1:46:42] out and he begins to come through pass
[1:46:44] through the portals of time and he
[1:46:45] begins to come and sit in your pew next
[1:46:47] to you and he begins to explain to you
[1:46:50] about through his spirit and he begins
[1:46:53] to explain to you about how that
[1:46:54] everything is going to be okay and
[1:46:56] everything in your life is going to work
[1:46:58] or work okay. You just read his
[1:47:00] scriptures, listen to the message and
[1:47:02] you stay steadfast into the word. That's
[1:47:05] the type type of divine fellowship. He's
[1:47:07] looking to be able to work his word
[1:47:09] through an individual. Not not to just
[1:47:12] not so that it just falls on deaf ear
[1:47:14] deaf ears. The word of God isn't just
[1:47:16] something a rule or codes that it's been
[1:47:18] written, but he's looking for a believer
[1:47:20] to be able to stand out and say, you
[1:47:22] know what, the the word of God has
[1:47:24] empowered me to be able to have divine
[1:47:27] fellowship with him. Not just a dryeyed
[1:47:29] confession, but something that we amen
[1:47:32] can stake something in the ground and
[1:47:34] say, "You know what? I talked to God
[1:47:36] here." You know, I could imagine maybe
[1:47:38] just through David's life, you know,
[1:47:40] David spent a good portion of his life
[1:47:43] running from Saul.
[1:47:45] you know, he literally goes from tending
[1:47:48] sheep, having a revival with God, you
[1:47:51] know, for many of years and fellowship,
[1:47:53] divine fellowship, and then all of a
[1:47:55] sudden he goes from tending sheep to
[1:47:58] running for his life. And I begin to
[1:48:01] think about how that, you know, he
[1:48:02] begins to but he would probably look
[1:48:04] back as he's down in a cave somewhere
[1:48:06] and be like, God, you know, we know that
[1:48:08] we know that in Ziglag, you know, at the
[1:48:10] battle of Ziglag that he went back and
[1:48:12] he was just like, Lord, they're going to
[1:48:13] stone me. I mean, he's sitting there
[1:48:15] literally talking with God. And I could
[1:48:17] just see his conversation as he's
[1:48:18] running from Saul. It's like, Lord, what
[1:48:20] have you done? You know, why why why
[1:48:22] have I come to why have I come to this
[1:48:24] place? Why why why have you went from a
[1:48:26] place where you anointed me king and now
[1:48:28] I'm running for my life when I should be
[1:48:30] when I should be you know king of where
[1:48:32] where the place that you anointed me at
[1:48:35] but it was the even in that portion of
[1:48:37] his life God was having fellowship with
[1:48:39] him and he was creating he was creating
[1:48:42] character down inside of David and a lot
[1:48:44] of times that we're going through our
[1:48:46] struggles is not just something that not
[1:48:48] just something it's oh this is just part
[1:48:50] of God's program no it's it's a place
[1:48:52] where you know what Lord maybe I need to
[1:48:53] stop and have a have have a word with
[1:48:55] you, have a moment with you to where I
[1:48:58] can have this fellowship with you to
[1:48:59] where I know that you're God of the good
[1:49:01] times just as you're God of the bad
[1:49:05] times. like to just read this little
[1:49:09] passage, little portion here. And it
[1:49:12] says, "And when and when he the
[1:49:14] sinner and fell or when he had sinned
[1:49:17] and fell and that little black cloud in
[1:49:20] there had become and had marred and had
[1:49:22] blacked and and had it was black and he
[1:49:25] came in by the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:27] Spirit and chased sin out out of the
[1:49:29] human and brings man back again into
[1:49:33] fellowship with God." You believe that?
[1:49:35] Back. Now notice then that's where you
[1:49:38] are. That's the matter with the
[1:49:40] Pentecost. Now I'm not after this or out
[1:49:42] to preach this afternoon, but I have the
[1:49:45] right to the platform and don't never
[1:49:46] want to know any person of the flesh.
[1:49:48] That's why I'm standing here. That's
[1:49:50] what the matter with the Pentecostal
[1:49:51] people is is they don't recognize who
[1:49:54] they
[1:49:55] are. They don't recognize who they are.
[1:50:00] And that's where I feel like maybe if
[1:50:02] we're not careful, we could sit right
[1:50:03] here in this church and not recognize
[1:50:06] who we are.
[1:50:09] That was that was the thing
[1:50:11] is he wants to bring us into the
[1:50:14] fellowship of this
[1:50:17] mystery. The mystery that God's in you.
[1:50:20] Okay, let me finish my
[1:50:22] quote. bring back and notice or and he
[1:50:26] says we might have he says I don't never
[1:50:29] want to know any person after the flesh
[1:50:30] when I'm standing here and that's the
[1:50:32] matter with the Pentecostal people they
[1:50:34] don't recognize who they are they're
[1:50:36] sons and daughters of God you have it in
[1:50:38] your hand look then Jesus it was one
[1:50:42] time quoted in the scriptures ye are
[1:50:45] gods look deity I'm a part of Charles
[1:50:49] Brham because I was born from Charlie
[1:50:51] Brandham my daddy I'm a part of him.
[1:50:53] I've got a forehead like him. My hair
[1:50:55] was like him. I'm a small man like him.
[1:50:57] And I'm in the nature like him because
[1:50:59] he's my dad. And if we become in spirit
[1:51:02] sons of God, deity dwells in man.
[1:51:06] Hallelujah. He says, then you talk about
[1:51:08] the blind eyes being open. They said
[1:51:10] nothing is impossible to God. God said
[1:51:14] nothing is impossible with you. If you
[1:51:17] believe, not with God, but you deity is
[1:51:20] in man. The very God that stood back
[1:51:23] back back there in the mythical platform
[1:51:25] of the eternities or yeah mythical
[1:51:27] platform of the inter eternities and
[1:51:30] rolled the world off of his hand and
[1:51:32] created these things giving you the
[1:51:34] privilege to be his son and you're part
[1:51:36] of him and God dwells in mankind and man
[1:51:39] himself is deity. Hallelujah. There you
[1:51:42] are. It might choke you a little bit but
[1:51:44] study over it for a little while. See,
[1:51:47] he he is God dwells in man and man
[1:51:50] becomes a son, not in himself, but the
[1:51:52] Holy Spirit that's in him. The creator
[1:51:56] lives in his creation. Aren't you glad
[1:51:58] for that here this evening? It says the
[1:52:01] creator lives in his creation. Oh my,
[1:52:04] how I think of that. Then then stand
[1:52:07] with an unwavering faith and ask what
[1:52:10] you will. It'll be done unto you. That's
[1:52:12] what it is. There's where he is. And
[1:52:14] that's the fellowship that we're
[1:52:15] speaking of here. this morning is that
[1:52:18] you, the sons of God, the daughters of
[1:52:20] God, have come come back into divine
[1:52:24] fellowship with his creator. Not your
[1:52:27] way of thinking, not through your uh
[1:52:30] denomination, not through your uh your
[1:52:32] abilities, but through the word of God.
[1:52:34] And what it does is it links you back
[1:52:37] with the creator. And that and that's
[1:52:39] the been the mystery this entire time is
[1:52:41] God in you. That's the hope. That's the
[1:52:44] hope is that of God being able to pour
[1:52:46] himself into man and to be able to
[1:52:49] express himself through this through his
[1:52:51] word. Amen. As the musicians come here
[1:52:54] this and I'll close with these few
[1:52:56] little things here. I wasn't wanting to
[1:52:59] keep you very long here this morning.
[1:53:01] And I know uh we had we had a lot of
[1:53:03] things going, but I just wanted to be
[1:53:04] able to express a few things of few of
[1:53:06] these things on my heart, but it's not
[1:53:09] just regular fellowship, but it's a
[1:53:12] fellowship that God has with his
[1:53:14] creation. And the thing is is if we
[1:53:17] don't get past the mentality that I'm
[1:53:19] just a human or I'm just I'm just I'm
[1:53:22] nobody, that God would would want to
[1:53:25] fellowship, the thing is is God sits at
[1:53:27] your house. God sits in your chair. God
[1:53:31] sits in your couch. God sits right here
[1:53:33] on the pew here with you here this
[1:53:34] evening.
[1:53:36] And it's not a bad thing to be able to
[1:53:39] bring your problems to God because you
[1:53:41] know there's a lot of times that there's
[1:53:42] problems that we can't solve
[1:53:44] ourselves. But I am going to say that
[1:53:46] it's a good thing to be able to have
[1:53:48] real divine fellowship with him.
[1:53:51] Not just not just something that not
[1:53:53] just something like a lay me down to
[1:53:55] sleep, but yet you have the most ability
[1:53:58] out of anybody else any other time
[1:54:01] period, any other age that we've ever
[1:54:02] lived in. This group of people that
[1:54:04] that's sitting right here this morning
[1:54:06] has more ability to be able to touch the
[1:54:09] heart of God than any other times and
[1:54:11] times past because God's desiring to
[1:54:14] fellowship with you. God's desire is to
[1:54:17] be able to come in with you and share
[1:54:19] the likes and dislikes. And that was the
[1:54:21] thing is is when the the when the
[1:54:23] apostles were talking about having a
[1:54:25] fellowship with him that they were the
[1:54:26] first to see so they know what
[1:54:28] fellowship with him is. And sometimes
[1:54:31] fellowship is is being able to push what
[1:54:34] we want aside to be able to take on what
[1:54:37] God's ideas
[1:54:38] are because our ideas a little 50/50
[1:54:42] sometimes. Sometimes our ideas on this
[1:54:45] brother or or on this idea when it comes
[1:54:47] to the word. But when you come to him,
[1:54:49] God seems to be able to straighten
[1:54:50] everything
[1:54:51] out. God's words be able God's word be
[1:54:54] able to come and as a son of God, you
[1:54:56] know, you know, going back in going back
[1:54:58] into
[1:55:00] adoption, brother Ben says this, and
[1:55:03] I'll read this quote
[1:55:05] here. It says when the adoption time has
[1:55:07] come, if the tutor that raised the child
[1:55:10] is found the child not
[1:55:13] worthy, they absolutely still remain a
[1:55:16] son, but they missed their adoption. But
[1:55:19] if they was adopted into the family,
[1:55:21] then they was in full fellowship with
[1:55:23] any check that they wrote was just as
[1:55:26] good as what they as what their daddy
[1:55:28] were owed. As many has as received him,
[1:55:32] to them gave he the power to become the
[1:55:34] sons of God. Many has called upon his
[1:55:37] name, and by the spirit were baptized
[1:55:39] into his body by the
[1:55:42] renewing. And there's where that comes
[1:55:44] in again, the renewing of their
[1:55:47] thoughts, not the slave mentality. Oh,
[1:55:49] I've done this and oh, I've done that
[1:55:51] and oh, I I've come. God's done washed
[1:55:53] all that away by the blood. And that's
[1:55:55] why he says that in order to come with
[1:55:56] this fellow, come by this fellowship,
[1:55:58] you got to be able to come through the
[1:55:59] blood.
[1:56:01] Okay. So, God has forgiven
[1:56:03] it, then why are you still bringing it
[1:56:05] back
[1:56:06] up? If God has forgiven you of your
[1:56:09] unworthiness, if God has forgiven you of
[1:56:11] of of your past sins and the things that
[1:56:13] you've done, now I'm not going to sit
[1:56:14] here and say you don't need to make it
[1:56:16] right. If there's something you need to
[1:56:17] make right, then you go do that. That
[1:56:19] that's what appear a sure sign that you
[1:56:22] are a
[1:56:23] son. But it's by the renewing of your
[1:56:25] mind. That way, your approach is
[1:56:28] different.
[1:56:29] The scripture talks about coming boldly
[1:56:31] to the throne of grace. You're not going
[1:56:34] to come boldly if you have all this
[1:56:35] baggage that you're weighing on you.
[1:56:37] You're not going to be able to come up
[1:56:38] and talk with God, you know, or you're
[1:56:39] not going to be able to, you know, we
[1:56:41] use children as an example, but you
[1:56:43] know, when Noah's in
[1:56:45] trouble, maybe 50/50. But when he comes
[1:56:49] to me, sometimes he he comes to me and
[1:56:50] he knows he's in trouble. He's just got
[1:56:52] that look on his face and you could tell
[1:56:53] by his facial expressions he's in
[1:56:55] trouble.
[1:56:57] But then there's times that he comes to
[1:56:58] me and it's it's not I'm in trouble.
[1:57:00] It's what are you doing? What are we
[1:57:03] doing? And that's where God's fellowship
[1:57:05] wants to be. He wants to have fellowship
[1:57:07] with his sons. He's tired of dealing
[1:57:10] with with humanity as he's tired of
[1:57:12] dealing with humanity as if like they're
[1:57:14] just some decrepit species that's been
[1:57:16] left on the earth somewhere. You know,
[1:57:18] it would it would anger me. It would
[1:57:20] anger me if my children come up to me as
[1:57:22] if they're they're just some servant or
[1:57:24] they're just some they're just some
[1:57:26] third party that's out there somewhere
[1:57:28] and I'm like and I come home and I'm
[1:57:29] always and I'm like where's my kids at?
[1:57:31] Like oh they're staying in the chicken
[1:57:33] coop because they don't want to they
[1:57:34] they don't think they're worthy enough
[1:57:36] to sleep in my in the
[1:57:38] beds now. They have their
[1:57:43] moments. And God doesn't want you just
[1:57:45] staying on the outsides in
[1:57:48] religion because
[1:57:52] you because you don't feel you're
[1:57:56] worthy or you don't feel that you're a
[1:57:59] son or you don't feel that you're a
[1:58:01] daughter or you don't feel that you know
[1:58:04] that oh he you know because we could get
[1:58:06] up here and preach these messages but
[1:58:07] Satan wants to sit there and say oh
[1:58:08] that's for your brother or that's for
[1:58:10] your sister that doesn't apply to you. I
[1:58:12] say it does apply to you. I say that you
[1:58:15] are a son of God. I say that you are a
[1:58:17] daughter of God. And you have just as
[1:58:18] much as as Enoch and Abraham and David
[1:58:21] if they had the ability to walk
[1:58:24] up and have fellowship with
[1:58:27] [Music]
[1:58:29] God. Let me tell you, when God was
[1:58:32] planning all this
[1:58:34] out, he had Miguel Gonzalez on his
[1:58:37] mind. When God was planning all this
[1:58:41] out, you know, he had haven on his mind.
[1:58:44] He was looking through the banisters of
[1:58:46] time. And it hurts
[1:58:49] God. I'm not speaking for God. I'm just
[1:58:52] speaking out in general.
[1:58:54] But it hurts God when you stand on the
[1:58:56] outsides of religion, on the outsides of
[1:58:58] his
[1:58:59] word and you sit there and you're like
[1:59:01] you're going through something, but you
[1:59:04] don't you don't get in fellowship with
[1:59:06] him and you don't get down on your knees
[1:59:07] and you're saying, "Lord, I I don't know
[1:59:09] this or I don't know that." And you and
[1:59:11] you go out and you look for what this
[1:59:13] doctor divinity says or what this says
[1:59:15] and he says, "My word says I say because
[1:59:18] you can't take you got to take a man at
[1:59:20] his word, right? And God is only as good
[1:59:22] as the what you allow his word to be.
[1:59:25] And if his word is your all and all and
[1:59:27] you've got that fellowship with him, you
[1:59:29] can be able to take this word and say,
[1:59:30] "Lord, look, I I'm tired of acting as if
[1:59:33] I belong in the chicken coop, but I'm an
[1:59:37] eagle." And Lord, I might be the
[1:59:39] sorryest eagle you got, which that's
[1:59:41] might be how you
[1:59:43] feel. But you know what he says? He
[1:59:46] gives more He gives more grace to the
[1:59:51] humble. And here this evening, don't
[1:59:54] stand on the outside of God's word as if
[1:59:56] you're just a a
[1:59:59] stepchild. Don't stand on the outside of
[2:00:01] God's word and say, "You know what? I I
[2:00:03] don't know if I can actually really have
[2:00:05] real fellowship with him like like
[2:00:07] brother Brandham or like my pastor or
[2:00:09] like these different ones." And every
[2:00:11] one of us have got a people that we look
[2:00:12] up to and we see. You can sit here and
[2:00:15] say, "No, I'm meant to have divine
[2:00:17] fellowship with
[2:00:19] him." God's sitting on the God's
[2:00:21] sitting, you know, and you dads know,
[2:00:24] you moms know of what it's like when you
[2:00:27] get home and you get there, you get home
[2:00:30] and you're sitting there and you're
[2:00:31] you're waiting for your children to come
[2:00:33] running for you, come running to you.
[2:00:36] You're waiting for you're waiting for
[2:00:38] your wife to be able to come. and you're
[2:00:40] waiting and but yet you come and there's
[2:00:42] no there's no reciprocation that takes
[2:00:44] place. You feel
[2:00:47] alone. Don't leave God
[2:00:50] alone. Don't leave God alone
[2:00:53] in in your prayer time. Don't leave God
[2:00:57] alone when you when when he beckons to
[2:00:59] you at your he beckons to you in your
[2:01:01] car, he beckons to you during the
[2:01:03] service or he beckons to you where
[2:01:05] wherever it might be. You know where
[2:01:07] that is? Where that still small voice
[2:01:08] comes and it just taps your
[2:01:11] shoulder and all of a sudden you begin
[2:01:13] to feel this this warmth feeling of
[2:01:16] peace come over to your body. Don't
[2:01:17] don't don't push that off. But I like
[2:01:20] how Samuel says, you know, he's
[2:01:23] Lord. Here I
[2:01:25] [Music]
[2:01:26] am. Lord, here I am. When God calls you,
[2:01:30] Lord, here I am. I'm your son. I'm your
[2:01:33] daughter.
[2:01:34] pushing back what the what the enemy
[2:01:36] says because sure thing he's going to
[2:01:38] try to keep you from fellowship with
[2:01:39] him. That's was his whole goal at the
[2:01:41] beginning that if I could divide
[2:01:44] them, if I could if I could divide the
[2:01:47] creator from his
[2:01:50] [Music]
[2:01:52] creation and it hurt
[2:01:55] God. It hurt
[2:01:57] him. That's why he slew a
[2:02:01] lamb. And when your kind was walking out
[2:02:04] of that garden that day, he
[2:02:07] promised he swore that he was going to
[2:02:10] restore
[2:02:13] fellowship. And I say that he has
[2:02:15] restored
[2:02:17] fellowship. He has restored that that
[2:02:20] place where you could walk out your door
[2:02:22] in the morning and said, "Lord, I see
[2:02:25] you everywhere." I like how you know the
[2:02:28] brother tells the story about the kid
[2:02:30] and he was talking about how he was
[2:02:31] asking his Sunday school teacher about
[2:02:33] where God is and where where and he kept
[2:02:36] find trying to find answers and he kept
[2:02:37] and he couldn't and he went fishing. I
[2:02:39] believe he was with one day on a with a
[2:02:41] man on a boat and he'd asked the man and
[2:02:43] he the man says well I see God
[2:02:46] everywhere. I see him in the trees and I
[2:02:48] see him in the I see him in the waves.
[2:02:50] to see him in all these different
[2:02:53] places until we get to that place where
[2:02:55] we see God everywhere we
[2:02:58] go because we're in fellowship with him.
[2:03:02] We have that divine fellowship. That's
[2:03:04] where I was just wanting to bring to our
[2:03:08] remembrance here this
[2:03:10] morning of where we are with fellowship.
[2:03:13] It's not just brother to brother and
[2:03:15] sister to sister. Those things are those
[2:03:18] things are fine.
[2:03:19] But but actual fellowship between a son
[2:03:22] and a father, an actual fellowship
[2:03:25] between a you know a a a daughter and
[2:03:29] their father because that's who you
[2:03:31] are. Don't come second rate to
[2:03:34] God. What are we singing mostly?
[2:03:41] And he
[2:03:43] walks with me. And he
[2:03:49] talks with
[2:03:52] me. And he
[2:03:55] tells me I am his
[2:04:03] own. And the
[2:04:06] joy we
[2:04:09] share as we
[2:04:12] tear be
[2:04:15] there none
[2:04:18] another has
[2:04:21] ever
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:29] known to the
[2:04:32] garden alone.
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:38] Oh, while the
[2:04:41] D is still on the
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:49] road. And the
[2:04:52] voice I
[2:04:54] hear falling
[2:04:57] on my ear.
[2:05:01] The
[2:05:03] son of
[2:05:06] God
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:12] discloses and he
[2:05:16] walks with me and he
[2:05:22] talks with
[2:05:25] me and he
[2:05:27] tells me I in his
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:35] own. And a
[2:05:38] joy we
[2:05:41] share as we
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] tear
[2:05:46] there. None
[2:05:49] other has
[2:05:52] ever known.
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:58] He
[2:06:00] speaks and the sound of his
[2:06:07] voice is so sweet.
[2:06:12] The birds hush their
[2:06:19] singing and the
[2:06:24] melody that he
[2:06:26] gave to
[2:06:29] me
[2:06:32] within my
[2:06:35] heart is reading.
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:43] and walk. Is that your desire here this
[2:06:47] [Music]
[2:06:48] morning is just to walk with the
[2:06:52] Lord? Maybe just to take a moment and
[2:06:55] say,
[2:06:57] "Lord, I desire to have
[2:07:00] fellowship. Lord,
[2:07:02] I'm I just don't want religion.
[2:07:07] I just don't want to a name lay me down
[2:07:09] to sleep. I just don't want to play a
[2:07:11] message and it just be something passing
[2:07:13] through my ears. But Lord, I desire a
[2:07:15] real divine
[2:07:18] fellowship. And if it's been a little
[2:07:20] while this morning, if it's been a it's
[2:07:23] if it's been a moment, you
[2:07:26] know, then why not take the time right
[2:07:30] now? Why not take this moment
[2:07:33] where where the spirit of the Lord is
[2:07:36] here and you have music playing
[2:07:40] and you've been like, "Lord, let me let
[2:07:42] me come to this place. Lord, forgive me
[2:07:44] for not fellowshipping with
[2:07:46] you, but Lord, I I should be
[2:07:49] fellowshipping with you. Let his divine
[2:07:52] presence come and meet your need
[2:07:55] here. Don't leave this place maybe too
[2:07:58] hasty. You know, you know where you're
[2:08:00] at. You know, you know where you are
[2:08:02] with God. And I promise you, God's
[2:08:05] knocking on the
[2:08:06] door. God's willing to come in. God's
[2:08:10] willing to be there. He's willing to
[2:08:12] have a real talk with you wherever
[2:08:13] you're at in your situations of your
[2:08:15] life. But he's willing to be there. Just
[2:08:19] give him a chance. Give God a chance.
[2:08:21] Give him more than
[2:08:23] just what you have time to give
[2:08:26] him, but give him out of your
[2:08:29] necessity. Give him give him something
[2:08:31] that that's Lord. I'm going to come to
[2:08:34] you with the sacrifice of praise. I'm
[2:08:37] going to come to you, Lord. I'm going to
[2:08:40] set aside
[2:08:42] time.
[2:08:44] [Music]
[2:08:49] Amen. Amen. Let's sing this. Let's sing
[2:08:52] that little that little song as the deer
[2:08:55] panth after the water

[2:09:05] panth the water so my

[2:12:42] your spirit.
[2:12:44] Lord, thank you for coming and

[2:12:56] that might be seeking you here this
[2:12:58] morning, Lord, looking for that closer
[2:13:01] walk. Lord, I would pray that you would
[2:13:04] come and you would just beckon to them
[2:13:06] throughout the week, Lord. That they
[2:13:08] might draw themselves closer to you,
[2:13:11] Father. Lord, that they might be able to
[2:13:13] come
[2:13:14] Lord, put theirelves in a place with
[2:13:16] you, learn more about you, fellowship
[2:13:20] more with you, Lord
[2:13:22] Jesus. God, I would ask that you would
[2:13:24] just be with our friends that are going
[2:13:27] to be traveling this
[2:13:29] evening, some that are traveling
[2:13:31] tomorrow. God, I would just pray, Lord,
[2:13:33] that you would just meet their needs on
[2:13:36] the road. Lord, keep them safe. God, be
[2:13:39] with those that aren't here this
[2:13:40] morning, Lord. Give them rest, Lord.
