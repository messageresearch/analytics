[17:19] know really what to say because the
[17:22] course of the redeem amen of the Lord
[17:25] and the love that you have for him
[17:29] and the grace that you have for one
[17:32] another and the love I think I think the

[17:39] mesmerized by this great Plan of
[17:41] Redemption that is working through you
[17:44] and me and I I'm I'm glad to be a part

[21:48] and uh here in the book
[21:50] of in the see the church age book at
[21:54] 298 and can everyone hear me okay here
[21:57] tonight
[21:59] um page
[22:01] 298 in the blue book and
[22:05] um uh I don't let's
[22:09] see it's we're going to be beginning
[22:11] here at the age of the open door in the
[22:14] Philadelphia and age I don't know what
[22:15] that would be in the
[22:17] red
[22:21] um and if someone has it in the red and
[22:23] you want
[22:25] to uh give the page number to that
[22:27] that'd be awesome
[22:29] to praise the
[22:32] Lord okay
[22:36] um let's let's see here so um we have
[22:41] just read that um Revelations 38 so
[22:44] we're going to skip on down to the
[22:46] second
[22:47] paragraph it says uh the first phrase of
[22:50] this verse I Know Thy works is analyzed
[22:55] in the rest of the verse for The Works
[22:57] had to do with the Open Door little
[23:00] strength the word and the
[23:03] name in order to understand the wealth
[23:06] of meaning involved in behold I have set
[23:08] before you an open door and no man can
[23:11] shut it we must now recall what has been
[23:15] said about each age running over into
[23:18] another age there is an overlapping a
[23:22] melting or fading in two rather than an
[23:25] Abrupt end or a clear cut start this age
[23:30] particularly flows in to the next age
[23:33] now if y'all remember in the church age
[23:35] as we've been going through every age
[23:38] they did not have a it did not just
[23:41] start and stop so amen uh so we went
[23:45] from Ephesians age and then there was an
[23:47] overlapping from Ephesians into the uh
[23:51] into the smea so as it's ending the
[23:53] other one there there's an overlapping
[23:55] as one's coming out or ending the other
[23:58] one is beginning and so um so that's
[24:02] what he's that's what he's saying even
[24:03] though we have the the dates here 53 to
[24:07] 170 170 to 312 each one of these ages uh
[24:12] they they overlap and so um and so he is
[24:17] talking about this this age here amen uh
[24:21] with the Philadelphian age and the leoan
[24:24] age it's going to be very very much so
[24:27] that way because the spirit of the Lord
[24:29] is already
[24:30] dealing uh in in sanctification and the
[24:33] power of God was was was beginning to
[24:36] move and he actually said that even even
[24:39] uh
[24:40] 1906 was a was a continuation of that
[24:44] sixth age as it's as it's entering in so
[24:47] always keep that in mind and so he's
[24:49] going back he's going back to that um it
[24:53] says not only does this age overflow
[24:55] into the last age the last age is in
[24:58] many respects simply carrying on of the
[25:01] sixth age the seventh age a very short
[25:04] age gathers up into itself for one quick
[25:08] work all the evil of every age and yet
[25:11] all the reality of
[25:13] Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has
[25:16] about run its course the leoan age
[25:19] quickly comes in bringing both the terrs
[25:23] and the Wheats and the wheat to harvest
[25:26] first bind the terrs to burn them them
[25:29] but gather the wheat into my barn
[25:31] Matthew
[25:32] 13:30 remember please this that the
[25:36] sardian age started the Reformation that
[25:39] must still go on until the grain that
[25:42] was planted at Pentecost goes through
[25:44] the full cycle of planting watering
[25:47] nourishing Etc until it comes right back
[25:50] to the original seed while this is going
[25:53] on the tears that were swn will have to
[25:57] go through their cycle and be harvested
[25:59] also that is exactly what we see
[26:03] happening if you can just think of the
[26:06] seasons you can get a very good picture
[26:09] of this the plant you see growing in
[26:12] full strength in the summer suddenly
[26:15] appears to be going to seed you can't
[26:17] tell exactly when summer became Autumn
[26:21] it just faded into it that is how the
[26:24] ages are especially these last two
[26:28] it is the age that Jesus says I come
[26:32] quickly that makes the last age a very
[26:35] short one Le oosa is the age of the
[26:39] quick work it is cut
[26:41] short now we will specifically dwell on
[26:44] the open door that no man can shut first
[26:48] of all I want to dwell on the open door
[26:51] as signifying the tremendous missionary
[26:54] effort of that age Paul called a new
[26:57] missionary endeavor
[26:59] um for the Lord an Open Door 2
[27:03] Corinthians 2:12 furthermore when I come
[27:06] to tro to preach the Christ's gospel a
[27:09] door was open unto me of the Lord so we
[27:13] can see by the comparison of the
[27:15] scriptures that this Open Door signified
[27:19] the greatest spreading of the Gospel
[27:21] that the world has yet has ever
[27:24] seen I want you to see something here
[27:27] God Works in threes doesn't he he was in
[27:30] the third or the pergamin age that um
[27:34] that the church was married to the
[27:37] state let me say it again it was in the
[27:40] third or pamenan age that the church was
[27:42] married to the state the Deeds of the
[27:45] nicians had become the doctrine of the
[27:48] nicians that age was the open door for
[27:51] the false Vine and once it was backed up
[27:55] by the power of the state it become
[27:57] actually a world system even though it
[28:01] bore the name Christian thus it spread
[28:04] like wildfire but now Three Ages later
[28:07] after a long and hard struggle of Faith
[28:10] here comes the open door to the truth
[28:13] the word of the Lord now has its day of
[28:16] course the fifth age had uh set the
[28:19] stage for this Mighty move as that age
[28:22] gave us exploration colonization the
[28:24] printing of books Etc it would have been
[28:27] one wonderful if this Open Door had
[28:30] followed the Divine pattern of Pentecost
[28:32] which was set forth in Hebrews
[28:35] 121:4 therefore we ought to give the
[28:37] most Earnest heed to the things which we
[28:39] have heard lest at any time we should
[28:42] let them slip for if the word spoken by
[28:45] Angels was steadfast every transgression
[28:48] and Disobedience received a just
[28:50] recompense of reward how shall we escape
[28:54] if we neglect so great a
[28:55] Salvation which at the first began to be
[28:59] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[29:01] unto us by them that heard him God also
[29:05] bearing them witness both with signs and
[29:07] wonders and with diverse Miracles and
[29:10] Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[29:13] own will now you know that this is the
[29:17] pattern for Jesus himself said so Mark
[29:20] 16:1
[29:21] 15-20 he said unto them go ye unto all
[29:25] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[29:29] Creature he that believeth and is
[29:31] baptized shall be saved but he that
[29:33] believeth not shall be damned these
[29:35] signs shall follow them that believe in
[29:38] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[29:41] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[29:43] take up serpents and if they drink any
[29:46] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[29:49] shall lay their hands on the sick and
[29:51] they shall recover so then after the
[29:54] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[29:57] received up in into heaven and sat on
[29:59] the right hand of God and they went
[30:02] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[30:04] working with them confirming the word
[30:06] with signs following amen he never told
[30:10] them to go into all the world and
[30:12] establish Bible colleges nor did he tell
[30:14] them to pass out literature now those
[30:17] things are fine but what Jesus told them
[30:20] to do was to preach the gospel stick
[30:24] with the word and then the signs would
[30:27] follow
[30:28] the very first introduction we have in
[30:30] the way of the kingdom of God was to be
[30:33] preached uh was to be preached was when
[30:36] he went out to the 12 sent out the 12 in
[30:40] Matthew 12 1-8 he commissioned and
[30:42] instructed them on this
[30:44] wise and when he had called unto him his
[30:47] 12 disciples he told them uh he gave
[30:50] them power against unclean spirits to
[30:54] cast them out to heal all manner of
[30:56] sickness and all manner of of disease
[30:59] now the names of the twel Apostles are
[31:01] these first Simon who was called Peter
[31:03] Andrew his brother James the son of
[31:06] Zebedee John his brother philli and uh
[31:10] bartha
[31:11] Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the
[31:14] Publican James the son of alfus and
[31:19] lebes uh whose surname was
[31:22] thadius uh Simon the Canaanite Judas es
[31:25] scariot who also betrayed him these 12
[31:29] Jesus sent forth commanded them saying
[31:32] go not into the way of the Gentiles and
[31:35] into any city of the Samaritans enter ye
[31:37] not but go rather to the lost sheep of
[31:40] the House of Israel as you go preach
[31:44] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[31:47] heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise
[31:50] the Dead cast out Devils freely you have
[31:54] received freely give the ministry that
[31:57] he gave gave them was actually the
[31:59] sharing of his own Ministry with them
[32:03] for it says in Matthew 9:35 to 38 Jesus
[32:06] went about all the cities and Villages
[32:09] teaching in their synagogues and
[32:10] preaching the gospel of the Kingdom
[32:12] healing every sickness and every disease
[32:15] among the people but when he saw the
[32:17] multitudes he was moved with compassion
[32:19] on them and because they had fainted and
[32:23] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[32:26] having no Shepherd then saith he unto
[32:29] his disciples the Harvest truly is
[32:31] plenteous but the laborers are few pray
[32:34] ye therefore the lord of the Harvest
[32:36] that he will send forth labors into his
[32:39] Harvest now many people have the idea
[32:42] that just the apostles had this ministry
[32:45] given them by the Lord Jesus and so when
[32:48] they died the ministry was over that is
[32:51] not so here in Luke 10 1-9 we find that
[32:55] in the days of his Earthly Journey he
[32:57] had already already started to give
[32:58] Ministers of power or ministries of
[33:01] power to his own after these things the
[33:05] Lord appointed other 70 also and sent
[33:08] them two by two because his face uh
[33:11] before his face into every city and
[33:14] place whether he himself would come
[33:16] therefore said he unto them the Harvest
[33:19] truly is great but the labors are few
[33:22] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[33:24] Harvest that he would send forth labors
[33:27] into his heart Harvest go your ways and
[33:31] behold uh I send you forth as Lambs
[33:33] Among Wolves carry neither purse nor
[33:36] script nor shoes and salute no man by
[33:39] the way and into whatsoever house ye
[33:42] enter safe first say peace be into this
[33:46] house if the son of peace be there your
[33:49] peace shall rest upon it if not it shall
[33:52] turn you again in the same house remain
[33:56] eating and drinking such things as they
[33:58] give for the labor is worthy of his hire
[34:02] go not from house to house and into what
[34:05] who whatever City ye enter and they
[34:08] receive you eat such things as are set
[34:10] before you heal the sick that are
[34:11] therein and say unto them the kingdom of
[34:14] God is come nigh unto you who would dare
[34:18] deny the mighty works or the mighty
[34:21] Ministry of Phillip who would dare to
[34:23] deny the mighty ministries of irus Paul
[34:27] a Martin
[34:28] Columbus uh Patrick and countless scores
[34:31] of others who had God's anointing upon
[34:33] them yes the Bible Way is the real way
[34:39] of the open door I want to add to my
[34:42] Ministry add my Ministry to that the
[34:45] reason I have to do that is because I
[34:47] can only speak with Assurance concerning
[34:50] what God has done in my own life so if
[34:54] you'll excuse a personal note here I
[34:56] will tell you how I know for assurity
[34:59] that Jesus is the same yesterday today
[35:02] and forever and that the power of God is
[35:05] still available to those who will
[35:07] believe and
[35:08] receive during my missionary trip to
[35:11] South Africa God so blessed that
[35:15] I that when I came to Durban the only
[35:18] place that could begin to accommodate
[35:20] the people was the huge racetrack which
[35:25] is the second largest in the world the
[35:28] crowd was well over a
[35:30] 100,000 in order to keep Law and Order
[35:33] they had to put up fences to separate
[35:35] the various tribes they posted hundreds
[35:39] of policemen to keep the throngs quieted
[35:41] down those hungry SS had come for many
[35:45] miles a queen from rishia had come with
[35:49] a train of 27 coaches loaded with
[35:52] African natives they struggled across
[35:54] the fields and mountains bearing on
[35:56] their backs for many and many miles some
[35:59] loved one that needed help the whole
[36:02] country was stirred by the mighty works
[36:05] that had been manifested by the Holy
[36:07] Spirit one afternoon as I be to minister
[36:10] one of the thousands of muhammadans come
[36:13] up on the platform and she stood before
[36:16] me as she stood before me a missionary
[36:19] to the muhammadans began to softly
[36:21] implore the Lord oh for that precious
[36:23] Soul oh for that precious Soul he had
[36:27] been over there for years and years and
[36:30] according to his own testimony he had
[36:32] seen only one muhammadan come to receive
[36:35] Jesus Christ as Savior they were
[36:37] originally the metal
[36:39] Persians whose laws change not they are
[36:43] so hard to win it seems that once a
[36:46] Muhammad and always a muhammadan is a
[36:48] law among them well as she stood before
[36:52] me I begin to speak to her and to all
[36:54] those thousands through the interpreters
[36:57] I said 'it is not so uh is it not so the
[37:01] missionaries have told you of a Jesus
[37:03] who come to save you you should have
[37:06] been you should have seen the people
[37:08] look at each other when I said that when
[37:11] they had answered that it was correct I
[37:14] went on and said but did the
[37:16] missionaries read to you out of this
[37:18] book I held my Bible a loft for them to
[37:22] see that this same Jesus was a mighty
[37:25] healer and that he would live than his
[37:27] people down Through the Ages until he
[37:30] come again to receive them unto himself
[37:33] did they tell you that because of that
[37:35] same spirit in them that was in Jesus
[37:39] that they would be able to do the mighty
[37:40] works even as Jesus did did they tell
[37:44] you that you can be healed even as you
[37:46] can be saved how many of you would like
[37:49] to see this same Jesus come down amongst
[37:52] us and do the same things that he did
[37:55] when he was here on Earth long ago they
[37:58] all wanted that that is one thing they
[38:02] surely agreed on I then went on if Jesus
[38:06] by his spirit will do what he did when
[38:09] on Earth will you believe his word then
[38:13] and here was the muhammadan woman in
[38:15] front of me and the spirit began to move
[38:17] through me I said to her now you know I
[38:21] don't know you I can't even speak your
[38:23] language she admitted that I said as for
[38:27] healing you know I cannot but you heard
[38:31] the message this afternoon and
[38:33] understood me her Indian interpreter
[38:36] answered back for her that she
[38:38] understood for that she had read the New
[38:42] Testament now the muhammadans are
[38:45] descendants of Abraham they believe in
[38:47] one God but they reject Jesus as the Son
[38:50] of God instead they take Muhammad as his
[38:54] Prophet they say that Jesus never died
[38:57] and rose again they are taught that by
[38:59] their priest and they believe it I said
[39:01] but Jesus did die and rise again he sent
[39:05] his Spirit back upon the church that
[39:08] Spirit was in that was in him is the
[39:11] very same spirit in the church now it
[39:15] can and will produce what Jesus
[39:18] produced he said in John 5:19 the son
[39:22] can do nothing of himself but what he
[39:24] seeth the father do for what things
[39:28] soever he doeth these also doeth the son
[39:31] likewise now then if Jesus will come and
[39:34] reveal to me what your trouble is or
[39:36] what you're here for if he can tell me
[39:39] what your past is surely you can believe
[39:42] for the future she said Through The
[39:44] Interpreter yes I can I said all right
[39:47] may he do it those muhammadans were
[39:49] watching intently they were all leaning
[39:52] forward to see what would happen then
[39:55] the Holy Spirit spoke your husband is a
[39:58] short heavys set man with a black
[40:00] mustache you have two children you were
[40:03] at the doctors about three days ago and
[40:05] he gave you an examination you have a
[40:07] cyst on the womb she bowed her head and
[40:10] said that is true I asked her how is it
[40:14] you come to me a Christian why didn't
[40:17] you go to your Muhammad prophet she said
[40:20] I think you can help me I said I can't
[40:23] help you but if you receive Jesus as
[40:26] your savior he who is here now and knows
[40:29] all about you he'll help you and she
[40:32] said I accept Jesus as my savior that
[40:35] did it she was healed and about 10,000
[40:39] mohammadans came to Christ that day
[40:40] because the gospel was preached in both
[40:44] word and power God never told a man to
[40:47] labor 30 years and harvest nothing he
[40:50] gave the open door of the word and power
[40:53] and that is what we are supposed to use
[40:56] that is what gave Paul his great
[40:59] effective Ministry First Corinthians 2
[41:01] and 4 and my speech and my preaching was
[41:05] not with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[41:07] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[41:09] of power listen to me now it was while
[41:13] on this same
[41:15] trip that I was boarding a plane at New
[41:18] Salisbury Ro
[41:20] rhasia and that I saw a party of four
[41:23] with American passports I went over to
[41:25] them and said hello there I see you have
[41:28] American passports are you traveling
[41:30] somewhere the young man answered and no
[41:34] we are all missionaries here how nice I
[41:37] replied are you on your own or do you
[41:40] work with some organization we are
[41:42] Methodist we come from Wilmore Kentucky
[41:45] he said well that is almost in my
[41:47] backyard I replied you wouldn't be that
[41:50] brother brandham that comes up from that
[41:52] way would you I said yes that's right
[41:56] and that cured him
[41:57] he wouldn't say another thing and the
[42:00] way he and those three girls just look
[42:02] back and forth at each other so I said
[42:05] just a minute son I'd like to speak to
[42:07] you all about some principles seeing
[42:10] we're all Christians and here for a
[42:12] great purpose now you say that you all
[42:16] have uh uh you have all four been here
[42:20] two
[42:21] years can you say in the name of Jesus
[42:24] that you can put a finger on one so that
[42:26] you know you have one to the Lord they
[42:29] could not do it I don't want to hurt
[42:31] your feelings girls I said but you ought
[42:34] to be home helping your mothers with the
[42:36] dishes you haven't any business out on
[42:40] the on the field unless you are filled
[42:41] with the Holy Ghost preaching the true
[42:43] gospel in the demonstration of the power
[42:46] of the Holy Ghost if you're not seeing
[42:49] the results that Jesus said you would
[42:51] see it's because you're not preaching
[42:53] the true gospel Let Me Go a step further
[42:57] and show you just how things can be on
[43:00] the mission field I don't say it is all
[43:03] this way but I'm afraid too much of it
[43:06] is it was while I was on the same trip
[43:09] and turing around Durban with the mayor
[43:11] that I saw a native with a tag around
[43:14] his neck and he was packing an idol I
[43:17] asked him I asked my
[43:19] friend what that tag was for and he says
[43:24] uh he said when a native Embraces
[43:26] Christianity they put a tag on him that
[43:29] sure surprised me for here was a man
[43:31] calling himself a Christian carrying
[43:33] that Idol so I asked how that could be
[43:37] he said I can speak the language let's
[43:39] go over there and talk to him so we went
[43:43] over and the mayor acted as my
[43:45] interpreter I asked the native if he was
[43:48] a Christian he affirmed he surely was a
[43:51] Christian I then asked why he carried
[43:54] the idol if he was a Christian he
[43:57] answered that it was an idol his father
[43:59] had carried and he left it to him when I
[44:02] told him that no Christians ought to
[44:04] carry Idols he replied that the idol had
[44:06] been of great use to his father and he
[44:09] was I was curious to know how and he
[44:12] said that one day his father was being
[44:15] stalked by a lion so he built a fire and
[44:18] spoke and and spoke to the idol the way
[44:21] he had been taught by the witch doctor
[44:23] the lion left I informed him that it is
[44:26] not the fire that sent the lion off as
[44:30] fire scares all wild animals I will
[44:33] never forget his reply he said well it
[44:36] is this way if amoya the spirit fails
[44:39] then this Idol won't a detailed account
[44:42] of the African campaign may be found in
[44:45] the book William brandom a prophet visit
[44:48] South Africa that is just about all the
[44:51] strength the Christian multitudes have
[44:53] because the word was not brought to them
[44:56] by the the original Open Door of
[44:59] Pentecost you know and and just to say
[45:01] here do you understand why we must have
[45:06] the life of God in our personal lives
[45:10] and in our church every one of us must
[45:15] maintain that life form is not what God
[45:18] is looking at as I as I was mentioned in
[45:20] Sunday morning form is not it he's
[45:23] wanting his life manifested through US
[45:28] amen for we are the body of Jesus Christ
[45:33] now he says um now getting back to the
[45:37] open Mission door of the Philadelphian
[45:40] age it does it did not have the open
[45:43] door of power it ought to have had
[45:46] notice in the same verse he mentions
[45:48] this open door he he says Thou Hast
[45:52] little strength that is right the power
[45:55] of the spirit was missing in that age
[45:58] the word was well preached it was well
[46:00] able to make Souls wise into salvation
[46:03] the great power of God that showed forth
[46:06] his mighty works that made bear his arm
[46:09] in behalf of his own was missing except
[46:11] amongst the scattered groups yet praise
[46:14] God it was growing and it increased uh
[46:18] over what they had in the
[46:20] Reformation it was in this age that the
[46:23] man we often call the father of missions
[46:26] went out
[46:27] William Cary a village Shoemaker who
[46:30] pastored the particular Baptist Church
[46:32] at Molton England Mily aroused the
[46:35] People by preaching on whether the
[46:37] command given to the apostles to teach
[46:40] All Nations was uh obligatory on all uh
[46:44] succeeding ministers uh to the end of
[46:46] the world seeing that the accompanying
[46:48] power was of it of equal extent and he
[46:53] was he was fought by The calvinist Who
[46:55] had gone to the extreme of the doctrine
[46:57] of election believing that all who will
[47:00] be saved will be saved and Mission
[47:03] missionary work would be against the
[47:05] work of the spirit but the Andrew but
[47:07] Andrew Fuller helped Mr Cary by his
[47:10] preaching and
[47:12] fundraising such was their effect that a
[47:15] society was formed to spread the gospel
[47:17] to all nations in
[47:19] 1792 this Society sent out Carrie who
[47:23] was signally blessed of God in winning
[47:26] SS in India in 1795 an aroused
[47:30] Christianity formed the London
[47:32] missionary society which we well know
[47:36] raised millions of pounds and sent
[47:38] thousands of missionaries over the years
[47:41] to accomplish the desires of the Lord
[47:44] the spirit of God was moving and other
[47:46] sheep might well have been the Cry of
[47:50] the heart of those Earnest Believers I
[47:53] have set before thee an open door I want
[47:57] I want to look at these words again this
[48:00] time I'm not going to disassociate them
[48:04] from missions I'm going to bring you a
[48:06] thought that carries deep into the last
[48:09] age as I have already stated this age
[48:12] melts into the last age it was in this
[48:16] age that Jesus says I come quickly verse
[48:19] 11 and of the last age he was going to
[48:22] finish the work and cut it short in
[48:24] righteousness because a short work will
[48:27] the Lord make upon the Earth Romans
[48:30] 9:28 notice how this verse of
[48:33] Revelations 3:8 goes Open Door little
[48:37] strength word name that open door has to
[48:42] do with all three now what does the door
[48:46] signify in John 10 and 7 it says uh then
[48:52] said Jesus unto them again verily verily
[48:55] I say unto you I am the door of the
[48:58] sheep that is right I am is the door of
[49:02] the sheep now this is not just a quain
[49:06] expression this is actually so notice in
[49:10] John 10 when Jesus is giving this
[49:12] Parable he calls himself to the
[49:15] shepherd then he calls himself to uh he
[49:18] calls himself the shepherd then he calls
[49:20] himself the door and that is what the
[49:22] shepherd is to the Sheep he is actually
[49:25] their door when I was over in in the
[49:29] East I saw that at night time the
[49:31] shepherd would gather all his sheep
[49:33] together he would put them into the foe
[49:36] then he would count them and when he was
[49:39] sure that they were all in he would lie
[49:41] down in the open door of the fold and
[49:44] literally become the door of the fold no
[49:47] one could get in and out except by him
[49:52] he was the door the next day as I went
[49:55] riding with a friend in a jeep
[49:57] I noticed that a Shepherd began to lead
[49:59] his flock into the city right away all
[50:02] the traffic came to a stop so that the
[50:04] Sheep could go through now the cities
[50:06] over in the East aren't like they are
[50:08] here we keep all our merchandise inside
[50:11] but there it's like a big farmers market
[50:14] with all the produce on the pavement for
[50:17] the pass buyer to see and buy I thought
[50:20] oh my here is where the riot begins wait
[50:23] till those sheep see all that food out
[50:25] there but as the shepherd went ahead
[50:29] those sheep followed right along exactly
[50:32] in each step they would look at those
[50:34] goodies but not a sheep touched a thing
[50:38] oh if I could only have known their
[50:40] language I would have stopped traffic
[50:43] myself and preach them a sermon on what
[50:45] I had just seen when you are a sheep
[50:48] that belongs to the great Shepherd you
[50:50] follow right along in each of his
[50:53] steps just as those sheep did you you
[50:56] won't be tempted to turn aside by some
[50:59] big flower of a church or listen to the
[51:02] voice of some DD PhD or lld D but you
[51:06] will stay with the shepherd the Bible
[51:08] says that the Sheep know his voice and
[51:12] they follow him but a she but a
[51:15] stranger's voice will only cause them to
[51:18] flee and run after the true Shepherd
[51:20] praise God but that was not all I saw
[51:25] and learned over there
[51:27] one day I got to thinking about having
[51:29] seen men out in the field hurting
[51:31] different kinds of animals one fellow
[51:34] would be tending some pigs and another
[51:36] some goats and another some camels
[51:38] another mules Etc so I asked a friend
[51:43] who lived there what they called those
[51:45] men oh he replied they are Shepherds I
[51:49] couldn't take that I said you don't mean
[51:52] to say they are all Shepherds Shepherds
[51:55] only heard sheep don't they no he said a
[51:59] Shepherd is a herder or Grazer so anyone
[52:03] who grazes animals is a Shepherd well
[52:06] that did surprise me but I noticed a
[52:09] difference between those herders and one
[52:12] and the ones who took care of the sheep
[52:15] come nighttime all the others but the
[52:17] she Shepherd of the sheep left his
[52:19] animals in the field and went on home
[52:22] the shepherd took his sheep with him and
[52:25] put them into the foe
[52:27] and then laid down and became the door
[52:29] of the sheep oh praise God Our Shepherd
[52:33] never leaves us or forsakes us one night
[52:37] come when Night comes I want to be in
[52:40] his fold I want to be in his care can I
[52:46] hear a great big
[52:48] amen amen so his word is is Everything
[52:54] Jesus is the door door to the Sheep
[53:00] now the as as the door to the Sheep I
[53:03] want us to I I want us to to to consider
[53:07] that I think it's important for for us
[53:10] all especially as uh as parents uh as we
[53:13] were talking to the kids the other night
[53:16] uh and the importance of of you uh
[53:18] children respecting your your
[53:21] M and uh and your daddies but uh but the
[53:26] import import that we have as
[53:30] as um as as Shepherds because we're
[53:35] Shepherds and it's so important that
[53:39] that we when when when we tell when we
[53:42] tell you kids things and we're and we're
[53:45] we're teaching yall and and but it's but
[53:48] we're not just teaching you
[53:50] all um it's not like a um it's not like
[53:57] your your daddy is is this this big old
[54:01] egotistic guy and and saying hey you
[54:04] better listen to me because I cuz I do
[54:06] what I you you do what I say they are
[54:09] teaching you the ways of the Lord and
[54:14] when you're following and that's and
[54:15] that's the thing and that's and I and I
[54:18] I I I believe I can say that 100% for
[54:20] every parent in here we're not
[54:22] interested so much in you following us
[54:25] as much as we're interested in you
[54:27] following Jesus and we're teaching you
[54:30] to follow the ways of the Lord and so as
[54:36] as M and daddies amen what we
[54:40] say how we how we minister to to one
[54:45] another and to the children amen is is
[54:49] so important I as brother Brandon was
[54:51] talking about that open door and and
[54:54] things I I I just went I just I just
[54:56] started looking here at at some other
[54:59] places in the scripture that would go
[55:01] along with with with the open door and
[55:04] and Colossians 4 and 2 and sister keys
[55:07] if you would if you would put that up
[55:09] because we won't we don't have to turn
[55:10] there
[55:11] necessarily uh unless you want to but
[55:14] Colossians 4 and
[55:17] 2 the Apostle Paul is saying continue in
[55:20] prayer and watching the same with
[55:23] Thanksgiving with praying also for us uh
[55:27] the Apostle Paul that God would open
[55:30] unto us a door of entrance utterance to
[55:35] speak the mystery of
[55:38] Christ for which I am also in bonds that
[55:42] it might that I might make it manifest
[55:45] as I ought to speak walk in wisdom
[55:48] toward them that are without Redeeming
[55:49] the time let your speech be always with
[55:52] Grace seasoned with salt that ye may
[55:55] know
[55:56] how ye ought to answer every man so the
[55:59] Apostle Paul is is talking the these
[56:03] this door of utterance is so
[56:08] important because you might not be a
[56:11] missionary you might not be a
[56:14] preacher but you do have a door of
[56:19] utterance to your family and what you
[56:23] what you speak what you do
[56:27] and not just her family but to one
[56:28] another I mean do we we we we are uh
[56:33] that this door of utterance we don't
[56:36] want it to just be the form but the
[56:38] power of Christ flowing out of us to
[56:42] others uh Ephesians 6: 19 uh here it's
[56:47] another place amen Ephesians 6:19 and
[56:50] for me that utterance may be given unto
[56:53] me that I may open my mouth mouth boldly
[56:57] to make the mystery known The Mystery of
[57:01] the Gospel amen um uh there in in
[57:05] Colossians 3
[57:08] and16 amen it says let the word of God
[57:12] or the word of Christ dwell richly or
[57:16] dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[57:19] teaching and admonishing that word
[57:21] admonishing is encouraging one another
[57:24] in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[57:28] singing with Grace in your heart to the
[57:32] Lord and whatsoever you do and word and
[57:35] do do it all in the name of the Lord
[57:37] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[57:42] father by him so as we as we look at
[57:45] this we can see that the Apostle Paul is
[57:48] saying that we all not just not just a
[57:51] church age
[57:52] messenger amen and not just an apostle
[57:56] just a a a pastor or a preacher but we
[57:59] all and in this case not just Mom and
[58:02] Daddy neither we all our communication
[58:06] with one another amen we are ministering
[58:10] Grace one to
[58:13] another let the word of God let this
[58:16] what what what word let this word of
[58:19] this generation this age so dwell in our
[58:22] hearts let us so um let let the let us
[58:26] abide in him and he abide in us let it
[58:29] let it be so rich so real so powerful in
[58:35] our lives amen that we even in our our
[58:39] conversations uh uh you know uh uh uh on
[58:43] on the playground or or or uh you know
[58:47] husbands and wives you know I I I even
[58:50] think about me and my wife how important
[58:52] it is for me to say the right words and
[58:55] keep keep Christ in the in the center of
[58:59] of our conversations and when she is
[59:02] doing it to me her words encourage me
[59:06] you see we take these words this message
[59:09] of the hour and and and we want to be
[59:12] rooted in this thing to where it's not
[59:15] just here but but to where it's it's
[59:18] part of our conversations it's not a
[59:21] coat we put on for church it's it's who
[59:24] we are and this conversation is is is is
[59:29] we we're careful what we say because the
[59:32] word of God is dwelling richly and we
[59:34] are encouraging and uplifting and and
[59:38] and and and and if someone's discouraged
[59:41] well we don't fall in the same trap with
[59:43] them we we encourage them because my day
[59:46] is coming where I'm going to be
[59:47] discouraged and I'm going to need
[59:49] someone to encourage me because that's
[59:52] what that's what we are as a body yes
[59:55] sir right well praise the Lord amen and
[59:59] so so uh uh uh so we you know you you
[1:00:04] can see you can see those things and
[1:00:06] actually if if you were to if you were
[1:00:08] to read all of that third chapter of of
[1:00:11] f of of Colossians uh it starts out amen
[1:00:15] uh uh uh set your affections on things
[1:00:17] which are above if you be risen set your
[1:00:20] affection on thing and then it
[1:00:21] automatically starts talking about love
[1:00:23] and it's talking about how we should
[1:00:25] operate with one another and then when
[1:00:26] it gets on down I mean there you know if
[1:00:29] you look there at the 12th verse says
[1:00:30] put on therefore as the elect holy and
[1:00:32] beloved vows in Mercy and kindness and
[1:00:34] humbleness of Mind meekness and
[1:00:36] longsuffering forbearing one another
[1:00:38] forgiving one another If any man have a
[1:00:40] quarrel against any even as Christ
[1:00:42] forgive you so also you do do ye above
[1:00:45] all these things put on charity which is
[1:00:47] the bond of perfectness let the peace of
[1:00:49] God rule in your hearts to the which
[1:00:52] also ye are called in one body and be
[1:00:54] thankful let let the word of God dwell
[1:00:58] in you richly with all wisdom teaching
[1:01:01] and admonishing encouraging one another
[1:01:03] in Psalms hymns and spiritual songs
[1:01:05] singing with Grace in your heart and
[1:01:07] whatsoever you do in word and deed do
[1:01:09] all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[1:01:11] thanks to God the Father by him can you
[1:01:14] say Amen look look there in in in
[1:01:16] Ephesians 5 and and
[1:01:18] 19 amen talking about speaking again
[1:01:21] that that door of utterance um there in
[1:01:24] in Ephesians 5 5 and 19 speaking to and
[1:01:28] that word to is amongst amen uh uh
[1:01:31] speaking amongst yourselves in Psalms
[1:01:34] hymns spiritual songs and singing and
[1:01:37] making melody in your heart to the lord
[1:01:40] always giving uh giving thanks always
[1:01:42] for all things unto God and the father
[1:01:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus can you
[1:01:47] say Amen so so and even here Ephesians
[1:01:52] 4:29 amen and I think I I think we
[1:01:55] should turn here on this one cuz this
[1:01:57] one is good it it's it's a good one to
[1:01:59] have marked in your Bible uh Ephesians 4
[1:02:02] and
[1:02:03] 29 praise the
[1:02:07] Lord oh my that you know sort of tying
[1:02:10] in with our uh Sunday words oh words are
[1:02:14] powerful and we need to train ourselves
[1:02:17] to speak the right
[1:02:19] words by your tongue you're condemned or
[1:02:22] by your tongue you're Justified so we
[1:02:24] got to train ourselves to say the right
[1:02:26] words amen amen keep it in it so so
[1:02:30] there in Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt
[1:02:34] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:02:36] but that which is good to the use of
[1:02:38] edifying now now here's here's the
[1:02:41] Beautiful the word you Minister this
[1:02:42] open door that it may Minister Grace
[1:02:47] unto the
[1:02:49] hearers help me Lord that means I don't
[1:02:53] have to be behind a Pulpit that I need
[1:02:54] to be careful at what I'm saying even
[1:02:56] outside the pull pit that means I need
[1:02:59] to be careful of what I'm saying uh uh
[1:03:01] to to my wife I've got to be careful I
[1:03:04] had Hur I had heard a young man the
[1:03:05] other day not meaning to my my
[1:03:08] intentions were totally were totally
[1:03:10] pure amen but I but IID hurt this young
[1:03:13] man and and and it was and when I had
[1:03:17] when I had seen that then I had to look
[1:03:20] at that and think go back and and and
[1:03:22] think okay I then I need to I I need to
[1:03:25] read I I to readjust or or rethink the
[1:03:28] way that I I would do something like
[1:03:30] that so it's important for me I it
[1:03:32] everything that is done should be done
[1:03:36] with the edification in mind
[1:03:42] edification amen and so when we're all
[1:03:45] when when we are all doing that with one
[1:03:47] another our goal our goal is Lord I am a
[1:03:53] minister you're a minister
[1:03:56] amen you're a minister and what you say
[1:04:00] to someone else matters and what you say
[1:04:02] to someone else matters what you say
[1:04:05] about your brother matters amen what you
[1:04:07] say about your brother matters it all
[1:04:10] matters one to another so we we want the
[1:04:14] word of God not to just hear it but let
[1:04:16] it dwell richly let me dwell upon these
[1:04:20] words let this word become so rich and
[1:04:23] fertile that it just comes out of me
[1:04:25] where I am not portraying wend Martin
[1:04:28] but to where I am portraying Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ and making sure that we are all
[1:04:34] amen that that whoever's around me is
[1:04:37] growing in the admonition of the Lord
[1:04:40] Jesus Christ can you say Amen so so we
[1:04:45] we want to do that because if not if we
[1:04:49] if we if we get into the if we get into
[1:04:51] this this um frame of mind you know uh
[1:04:57] uh if if if if if the word isn't
[1:05:00] dwelling richly in US something's going
[1:05:02] to if the word isn't dwelling there then
[1:05:05] there's going to be then then whatever's
[1:05:07] then it'll vacate with pride and and and
[1:05:11] and and Malice and and bicker and and
[1:05:14] and feuding and and those kinds of
[1:05:16] things that dwell in us or that it
[1:05:19] something's going to take its place amen
[1:05:22] and the scripture says there in James um
[1:05:25] James I I believe the the the first
[1:05:29] chapter toward the end of it amen he
[1:05:31] says he says you you got to look into
[1:05:33] that perfect law of Liberty and and
[1:05:36] you've got to you you've got to realize
[1:05:39] that I'm not just a hearer but I want
[1:05:41] the word to become a doer I don't want
[1:05:44] this just to come here but it's
[1:05:47] important that it that it is manifested
[1:05:49] through me and he says now if that does
[1:05:52] not happen if you're just a hearer and
[1:05:53] you're not a doer he says then that that
[1:05:55] man is one who has come looked into the
[1:05:58] mirror and then forgot what he has done
[1:06:01] matter of fact let's just turn there
[1:06:02] real quickly now before we dismiss let's
[1:06:05] let's look at James 1 I think
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:18] um I I loved I I love that this church
[1:06:22] book here this the church age book that
[1:06:25] that we have
[1:06:26] and um so many good things in it you
[1:06:31] know let's see and and it's a good one
[1:06:34] for for you guys to uh mark down there
[1:06:36] let's
[1:06:37] see James
[1:06:41] 1 yeah
[1:06:47] um okay so let's let's look here at the
[1:06:50] I don't know uh J let's just break in
[1:06:51] here at James 1: 19 wherefore my beloved
[1:06:54] brethren let every man be swift to hear
[1:06:58] slow to speak slow to wrath for the
[1:07:00] wrath of man worketh not the
[1:07:02] righteousness of God wherefore lay apart
[1:07:05] all filthiness and superfluity of
[1:07:07] naughtiness and receive with meekness
[1:07:11] the engrafted word which is able to save
[1:07:14] there your souls but be ye doers of the
[1:07:17] word and not hearers only deceiving your
[1:07:19] own s for if any be a hearer of the word
[1:07:23] and not a doer he is like un to a man
[1:07:26] beholding his natural face in a glass a
[1:07:28] mirror for he beholdeth himself goeth
[1:07:31] his way and straightway forgiveth what
[1:07:33] manner of man he was but who so lookth
[1:07:37] into the perfect law of Liberty and
[1:07:39] continueth therein him being not a
[1:07:42] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[1:07:45] this man shall be blessed in his deeds
[1:07:49] If any man among you seem to be
[1:07:50] religious religious and bridleth not his
[1:07:53] tongue but deceiveth his own heart this
[1:07:57] man's religion is in vain so so here he
[1:08:02] is he is saying your
[1:08:04] ministry the ministry is not okay I've
[1:08:07] got a good deed I've got to do you know
[1:08:09] I need to do something to I need to go
[1:08:11] um I need to go visit so and so I need
[1:08:14] to go uh talk to somebody about Jesus it
[1:08:17] it's it's it's it's not having its
[1:08:20] perfect effect yet because the life of
[1:08:21] God is what we're interested in not not
[1:08:24] not not not how many Deeds we're doing
[1:08:27] remember the Deeds aren't the form is
[1:08:28] not what God's looking for what God's
[1:08:30] looking for is the heart what God's
[1:08:32] looking for is that word having its
[1:08:34] effect in us so Lord let me be a hearer
[1:08:37] but Lord live it through me manifest it
[1:08:41] through me does that make sense amen and
[1:08:44] when it does Amen that will that that
[1:08:48] will be a Ministry to everyone you come
[1:08:53] in contact with
[1:08:56] Hallelujah so I say today that there
[1:09:00] there is an Open
[1:09:03] Door for
[1:09:05] Madison there is an Open Door amen not
[1:09:08] just for brother Joshua amen but but

[1:10:19] they want to add to that any uh anything
[1:10:22] you want
[1:10:23] to uh to add had or any questions y'all
[1:10:26] might have praise the Lord
[1:10:32] amen Oh I thought you had a question
[1:10:36] praise the
[1:10:38] lord well glory to
[1:10:41] God all right
[1:10:45] amen did y'all enjoy that tonight wasn't
[1:10:47] that isn't that just
[1:10:49] awesome I I love
[1:10:53] it so
[1:10:56] we want now and and and and as we as we
[1:11:00] get ready to dismiss and you can uh the
[1:11:02] musicians can
[1:11:05] come but
[1:11:09] um go going back if you don't if you
[1:11:12] don't keep the word of God dwelling
[1:11:14] richly amen and you then then you'll
[1:11:18] you'll grieve the holy spirit in your
[1:11:20] life and the worst thing we could ever
[1:11:22] do there's nothing more miserable than a
[1:11:24] Christian
[1:11:26] that is that that is a Son of God and
[1:11:29] he's just got Plum full of
[1:11:31] bitterness he just so so Plum full of
[1:11:35] bitterness and and I've seen you know
[1:11:37] and in
[1:11:39] my
[1:11:40] um and and and this ain't putting him
[1:11:43] down CU my grandfather was a very good
[1:11:45] man uh loved the Lord my my grandfather
[1:11:48] wrote some of the most incredible
[1:11:51] songs songs with great meaning
[1:11:56] he was the one of the most giving guys
[1:11:58] around loved the Lord he was just
[1:12:00] incredible but he died in
[1:12:05] bitterness and and the good that he
[1:12:09] had the good that he had was sort of
[1:12:12] overshadowed by the
[1:12:14] bitterness
[1:12:16] and and I've I've thought of that
[1:12:20] often I think we need to guard our
[1:12:23] heart especially in this day where the
[1:12:26] book where where the veil has been taken
[1:12:27] off of Satan's Playbook because we know
[1:12:31] we know how Satan's going to operate we
[1:12:34] know his
[1:12:37] tactics so really bitterness is not an
[1:12:40] option for us as long as we choose to
[1:12:44] let the word of God dwell richly in US
[1:12:47] bitterness is not an option The Playbook
[1:12:50] is open we know what Satan's going to do
[1:12:53] he's going to do it he does it every
[1:12:55] church he does it in every family he
[1:12:56] does it in every individual he does it
[1:12:58] in every nation it's going to happen and
[1:13:01] every one of us are going to be given
[1:13:04] the opportunity to become
[1:13:07] bitter but the scripture says at one
[1:13:11] time ignorance God winked at but when
[1:13:15] the Revelation comes now it becomes
[1:13:21] sin it now becomes sin
[1:13:25] so now here here we we look and we say
[1:13:29] God then I'm going I'm going to do what
[1:13:32] I have to
[1:13:35] do we know you know if it's between you
[1:13:39] and your wife you and your
[1:13:41] husband you you you you you you you've
[1:13:43] got to just look you just got to look in
[1:13:45] the mirror and say you know through the
[1:13:48] opening of the
[1:13:51] word and through the Vindicated voice of
[1:13:53] God in this generation you know fella
[1:13:56] that I am pointing to in the mirror you
[1:14:00] know that that devil that is fighting me
[1:14:02] and my wife or me and my husband
[1:14:05] or me and my
[1:14:08] child is the same
[1:14:10] devil that is trying to take out that
[1:14:13] family and other families around trying
[1:14:16] to destroy
[1:14:19] us you look in that mirror and you say
[1:14:21] I'm going to bring every thought I'm
[1:14:23] going to bring every imagination
[1:14:25] I'm going to bring everything under the
[1:14:28] control of God's
[1:14:31] word don't let
[1:14:34] anything don't let anything come in
[1:14:40] between that don't let anything close

[1:14:50] Christ the open door is the
[1:14:53] manifestation of love
[1:14:56] don't let anything come in between
[1:15:00] that and usually when you think of it
[1:15:02] and that way you're going to go to the
[1:15:04] person who's done you wrong you're going
[1:15:06] to go to the person that you
[1:15:09] think should should be better or
[1:15:12] whatever it
[1:15:14] is usually the reason why there is a
[1:15:17] conflict is because it takes two to have
[1:15:19] a conflict
[1:15:25] and you
[1:15:27] forgive you just simply
[1:15:33] forgive what she does or he does it's
