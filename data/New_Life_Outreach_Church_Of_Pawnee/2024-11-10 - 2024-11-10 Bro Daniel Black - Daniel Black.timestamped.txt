[8:13] could pull on the gift that you put into
[8:14] my life Lord and Lord Jesus that they
[8:17] can increase their faith tonight in this
[8:19] service through the preaching of your
[8:20] word in Jesus name amen God bless you
[8:23] you can be
[8:24] seated you know this scripture is one of
[8:27] the saddest places in scripture uh
[8:30] this this is is one of the hardest times
[8:31] is because Christ was outside the church
[8:33] and and you know man has constantly
[8:36] missed the Lord and it's because he
[8:39] comes so simple that they miss him and
[8:41] you know a lot of times the Lord thinks
[8:43] if God's going to come he's going to
[8:45] come this certain way and because he
[8:47] comes so simple they miss him you know
[8:50] they think it's got to be more
[8:51] complicated to that it's got to be more
[8:52] to it than that but you know I'm going
[8:54] to tell you something the Gospel of
[8:55] Jesus Christ is simple it's a God that
[8:58] loves you you know we were all Fallen
[9:00] toward sin every single one of us we
[9:02] were born in sin we were shaped in
[9:03] iniquity Lord you didn't ask to be born
[9:06] you were chosen and you were chosen for
[9:08] a purpose and you know the God has
[9:10] chosen us because you know in the Garden
[9:12] of Eden God was able to fellowship with
[9:14] man lip to ear there was no hindrance
[9:16] think of it how wonderful it was in the
[9:18] Garden of Eden where God could come down
[9:20] in the cool of the evening and speak to
[9:22] Adam lip to ear absolutely no hindrances
[9:25] but you know God allowed the things that
[9:26] happened with through the through the
[9:28] serpent because God had all these
[9:30] attributes inside him that he desired to
[9:32] unveil himself God had the attribute of
[9:35] being a savior of being a comforter of
[9:37] being a Healer of being all these
[9:39] wonderful things of being a father but
[9:41] you know God being that great spirit he
[9:43] couldn't do that unless it happened you
[9:45] know I had the potential of being a
[9:47] grandfather and praise God in March I'm
[9:49] going to be a grandfather haha praise
[9:52] the Lord I can praise the Lord for that
[9:55] I had the attribute all the time but you
[9:57] know what in order for me to have a
[9:58] grandchild I've got to have a son then
[10:00] that son's got to have another son you
[10:02] know God's the same way God had the
[10:04] attribute inside him to be a Healer a
[10:06] savior a comforter and God allowed the
[10:08] things that took place in life so those
[10:10] things could come out of him and you
[10:12] know there was a a great time of
[10:14] Fellowship that God had with man and we
[10:15] know that the through through the fall
[10:17] of what took place that Fellowship was
[10:19] broken between men where there there no
[10:21] longer man could just come to talk to
[10:23] God freely with lip to ear because of
[10:26] sin had come between man and God but God
[10:29] praise God made a way for man to come
[10:32] back to him back into fellowship with
[10:33] him you know it's not through emotions
[10:35] it's not through Sensations it's through
[10:37] the blood of Jesus Christ you know God
[10:40] that is where God will meet the
[10:41] worshipper is under the blood brother
[10:43] and sister let me let me say this again
[10:45] the gospel is simple God wants to live
[10:48] inside your heart God wants to save you
[10:50] from your sins but not just that God
[10:52] wants to use you you were born for a
[10:55] purpose you are ordained for a purpose
[10:57] every person here you are born for a
[10:59] purpose you can take a seed of an apple
[11:02] and every Apple that will ever be
[11:04] produced from that tree is in that seed
[11:06] already and inside every one of you
[11:08] there's a seed inside that seed is a
[11:10] potential for you to manifest the
[11:13] attributes of God can you say amen I
[11:15] think I just lost myself I just speak
[11:17] louder every seed has the ability inside
[11:20] of it to Bear the fruit that it was
[11:22] ordained to do and every person under
[11:24] the sound of my voice you are born for a
[11:27] purpose God chose you God ordained you
[11:30] for a purpose but you must come God's
[11:32] provided way
[11:34] amen I'm reminded of in the Civil War
[11:38] can y'all hear me at all here we go
[11:40] maybe praise the Lord I'm reminded in
[11:42] the Civil War of his story how a man
[11:44] that was on the on the firing squad and
[11:47] of the of the war and this man was going
[11:50] to to hold his post of Duty but in the
[11:53] midst of his post of Duty he got afraid
[11:55] under Warfare and under this Warfare
[11:58] this man run from his post of Duty and
[12:00] went somewhere else and they caught him
[12:02] and this man was going to die of a
[12:04] firing squad this man was going to die
[12:07] because he when you leave your posted
[12:10] Duty listen to me when you leave your
[12:12] posted Duty you're go you're you're
[12:14] going to have to face consequences and
[12:16] so this man was going to die by a firing
[12:18] squad and he had a good friend that
[12:20] loved him he said you know what my
[12:22] friend is going to die unless I can get
[12:25] to the president so this man run as hard
[12:28] as he could all long to get to President
[12:31] Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln was
[12:34] going down the road and had his Bible in
[12:36] his hand reading his Bible and the
[12:38] soldiers stopped him he said stop right
[12:40] there he said it's so important that I
[12:43] talk to the president tonight he said
[12:45] because if I don't talk to him an
[12:47] innocent man is going to die and Abraham
[12:50] Lincoln waved the man on and he said sir
[12:53] Abraham Lincoln sir I've got a friend
[12:56] who I went hunting with I went squirrel
[12:58] hunting with him he's a good man he's
[13:01] got a family we were on war and he was
[13:04] in the midst of war in the midst of War
[13:06] he got afraid and he run away and he's
[13:09] going to die by a firing squad Abraham
[13:11] Lincoln sir could you please help this
[13:14] man please Abraham Lincoln looked down
[13:16] to his Bible and found a piece of paper
[13:18] and just ripped a small piece of the
[13:20] paper off he says I Abraham Lincoln
[13:25] pardon this man he says thank you sir
[13:28] thank thank you he takes this piece of
[13:31] paper and he runs as fast as he can all
[13:33] the way back to the man standing behind
[13:35] bars the man standing behind there
[13:38] waiting to die there is a firing squad
[13:41] outside the wall he says you're free
[13:43] you're free you're free the man says
[13:46] what do you mean I'm free he said I've
[13:48] been in the presence of the of the
[13:50] president of the United States he has
[13:53] set you free he's given me a pardon to
[13:56] give to you he said get out of here
[13:59] you're making fun of me he said no it's
[14:02] a pardon by the president you're free
[14:04] you're free and the guy said get out of
[14:06] here that was the president of the
[14:08] United States it would be bigger than
[14:09] this there would be a band going through
[14:11] there'd be a big piece of paper there'd
[14:13] be music there'd be this he said get out
[14:15] of here you're making fun of me he says
[14:18] no you're free I'm telling you you're
[14:20] free he said guards get this man out of
[14:23] here they come got the man and he died
[14:26] by firing squad that morning they tried
[14:29] it in the federal courts and come to
[14:31] find out a pardon is only a pardon if it
[14:34] is received as a pardon listen me
[14:37] brother and sisters the Gospel of Jesus
[14:39] Christ is simple it's the blood of Jesus
[14:41] Christ that Jesus died for your sins and
[14:44] you must receive that blood because you
[14:46] know what I'm going to tell you
[14:47] something in the Old Testament when they
[14:48] had the the sacrifice of the Lamb they
[14:51] would bring a lamb that's without
[14:52] blemish and when they brought that lamb
[14:54] before the priest they didn't even look
[14:56] at the worshipper you know what they
[14:57] looked at the lamb
[14:59] that would inspect the lamb to make sure
[15:01] that lamb was perfect because if that
[15:04] lamb was accepted they were accepted I'm
[15:06] here to tell you God don't even look at
[15:09] you God looks at the blood brother and
[15:11] sister and he says because the blood is
[15:13] worthy you are worthy but you got to
[15:16] accept that blood that is your pardon
[15:19] and you say God I believe it I believe
[15:21] your word I accept what you've done for
[15:23] me and God it opens the way of
[15:25] Fellowship for
[15:26] you there's a picture of Jesus that many
[15:29] I'm sure we are probably all familiar
[15:31] with is where Jesus is standing at a
[15:33] door and Jesus is knocking on the door
[15:36] and the holoc critics looked at that and
[15:38] said you know what there's something
[15:39] missing in the picture there's no door
[15:41] knob on this door Jesus is standing at a
[15:45] door and he's knocking on there's no
[15:46] door knob and come to find out he says
[15:48] because the door knob is on the inside
[15:51] and you must accept him from the inside
[15:53] out and that's exactly how it is when
[15:56] Jesus Christ is knocking on your heart
[16:00] you got to receive him from the inside
[16:02] of you you know we can give you the
[16:04] pardon but you got to be the one to
[16:07] receive it and say Lord I accept it you
[16:10] don't have to beg him for it you don't
[16:12] have to bleed on it you don't have to
[16:13] beat on the altar just receive it if you
[16:16] will receive it brother and sister God
[16:19] wants God wants you to have it you know
[16:21] if my son was hungry I'm not going to
[16:22] give him a stone I'm going to give him
[16:24] bread why because he's my son I love him
[16:27] how much more would God give you the
[16:29] eternal life that you desire God died
[16:32] for you that you can have it it's yours
[16:35] accept it amen God wants to work in our
[16:38] life how many of you want God to work in
[16:39] your life I desire I desire God to work
[16:43] in my life he wants to work in your life
[16:46] it comes so simple it's not Dynamic it's
[16:49] not great it's little you know fire is
[16:52] hard to you ever start with big list of
[16:54] blades that hits the ground and catches
[16:56] on fire it usually starts with a little
[16:58] splinter
[17:00] and that little bitty Splinter brother
[17:01] and sister will start a wildfire and all
[17:05] God needs to do is get one soul in his
[17:07] hand that'll get on fire for him and you
[17:09] can set the whole church on fire you can
[17:11] set your whole family on fire you can
[17:13] set your whole community on fire what
[17:15] does it take one Soul one Splinter don't
[17:18] try to be a big log be a splinter cuz
[17:22] listen to me if if God wants you to be a
[17:24] big log he'll make you a big blog but

[18:15] a doorman of the church listen to me you
[18:17] be the best doorman of the church that

[18:40] fingers that the anointing of God would
[18:43] flow through my voice that I can break
[18:46] barriers that I can be David that I can
[18:49] slay Goliath that I can do the victory
[18:52] CU listen to me you can do it through
[18:54] Christ that's right brother and sister
[18:57] you can do it you've got a
[18:59] you are ordained for a purpose and

[20:21] respect no Moses had to take his shoes
[20:24] off of because he was on Holy Ground it
[20:26] wasn't because the mountain was holy it

[21:26] was due but here come a little woman
[21:27] praise God she was walking down the
[21:29] street and there was something on the

[22:01] way and she humbled herself and washed
[22:03] his feet this woman left with her sins
[22:05] forgiven but brother and sister it's
[22:07] because she recognized the presence of
[22:09] the Lord and she gave him the praise
