everyone here praying with him and uh of course we want to continue to pray for brother uh uh brother Mitch as he's recovering with with his hand I notice he's not here this morning and so uh we want to continue to pray for him and uh always pray for Dad amen he wants to be here and and um but we' we've got a we've got a promise amen there might be some dark clouds right here amen but there's some but there's sunshine on the other land can you say amen and so we're looking forward to going home let's look here in Mark 16 and um let's see um let's start let's just start at the 14th verse afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and up braided them with with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth somebody say believeth believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not somebody say believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe everyone say believe believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your presence that we feel here this morning the wonderful songs that have been sung Lord the the specials that have been sung today Lord we thank you we thank you for your grace and your your goodness because it's not by it's not by power and it's not by might but it's by that Supernatural presence of the spirit of God upon the heart and we love you Lord father I I ask that you would see those that aren't here today and that you would touch Lord and be with brother Mitch Lord as he's recovering with his hand and and Lord give him a speedy recovery be with brother Lord uh Martin as he is as he is weak and and Lord I visited him last night and Lord just not just just weak in his body father oh God we still are looking to that blood Covenant that you have made Lord Lord uh we we just ask that you would see our our our brother uh Watkins Lord and our brother Barry and I I'm asking Lord that you would heal them Lord and Let Your Presence be with them and let the anointing of God be upon them oh God you're our healer and we look to you father just ask that you would speak to us this morning help our hearts Lord to just be in tune with you and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning I uh want to just take a title from the heart and this is going to just just be uh pretty simple here this morning as we as we deal with faith and believing from the heart and we we could see he that believeth shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned that's pretty simple amen and and so if you have forsaken the way of life if you have forsaken What God gives you amen uh then there that you you have no blessings of God upon you brother brandom says it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they he would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word amen see in verse three it says uh blessing is pronounced on those that give special attention to this book I think it refers to the Old Testament custom of the priest reading the book to the congregation in the morning and you see uh many could not read so the priest had to read it to them as long as it was the word the blessings was theirs it didn't matter if it was read or if it was heard the blessing is to those that believe amen can you say Amen now brother Bram would say the first thing before we can have faith we've got to have some foundation for Faith there has got to be something behind it so so in order to have Faith there's got to be a reality for Faith to rest upon amen now now Santa Claus you can put Faith in Santa Claus but there but that's a myth amen uh uh the scripture says that the all all of these religions amen uh arrive or derrive out of the bottomless pit Amen in other words there's no foundation for their faith to rest upon amen amen so the believer has something to rest our faith upon it's it's not we're just not putting it in nowhere amen faith has a foundation and that is God's word amen there is the foundation of Faith amen matters of fact brother brother Brandon would titled that sermon the fundamental foundation for Faith so faith has got to have something to rest upon amen now you can believe in Santa and that's you know I I Satan has a way of of of just uh coming in and and and trying to so intermingle his junk so that our faith just doesn't have anything amen you you you you look at Santa Claus and oh my Santa Claus associated with Christmas and then before you know it you are you you you you find out that Santa Claus is not real you they've got the Easter bunnies and and the and the egg hunts and all of this on Easter amen and before you know what you find out man that's not even real you you you you you have the tooth fairy and then you find out that it's not even real and and so we associate that kind of nonsense with with Christianity amen and Christianity is not a myth right Christianity has nothing to do with Santa Claus Christianity has nothing to do with with with with Easter Bunnies Christianity is faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ can you say Amen so this is not an imaginary faith and our heart must have something that we can believe in now now you can do it with your mind you there's too many times that that we try to accept the word of God with our mind and you cannot accept god with his with your mind you cannot believe God with your mind it always reasons with the thing and will always talk you out of the supernatural right amen that's true so so Faith's Foundation is upon God's infallible word if you were to look there in Hebrews if you put that up Hebrews 11 And1 amen faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of not of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and we know through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God God so that the things which are seen were made of things which do not appear in other words they had to be a foundation Hallelujah you know the world it it it doesn't you amen it's just it's just rolling in air it's just hanging in space all by itself amen but it's upheld by the word of God and God believing his own word and so the believer amen God doesn't want you believing with your mind God wants you believing with your heart God God doesn't want you believing with your emotion God wants you believing with your heart God doesn't want you Amen to accept things amen as they come God wants you to be forever settled in your heart upon thus saith the Lord and then you can Prevail in your darkest of hours then you can Prevail in the bottom of the sea then you can Prevail Amen in the Lion's dead then you can Prevail in in in the fiery furnace it does not matter then because faith has found its resting place upon the infallible unchangeable word of God and you're resting there amen now amen we understand only from the heart can you can you believe there in Romans 10 and 6 it says but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this why saying or say not in your heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above who shall descend into the deep that is to bring Christ up from the dead what saith it the word is n thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart that is the word of faith which we preach now want you to understand notice this that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God ha raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believes under righteousness and with the mouth confession is made under salvation for the scripture sayith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed Hallelujah shall never be ashamed so it's got to be amen too many times we know that it faith our our our our our belief system is built upon the spirit man which is the mind and the reasoning and things because that's the way our mouth talks amen but with the heart man believeth and from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh Hallelujah so you get this you see this is where the heart amen I believe it was there in the book of of proverbs 4 and 20 he says my son attend to my words inclin thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh so so he's so he's telling him now this word is health and it's life I want you to keep these words in your heart but now watch it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life so the the the the emphasis is turning from hear my words attend to my sayings amen keep my Commandments and now it's telling you guard that heart because only through your faith in my words will it bring Health to you amen now I think this is in important because we don't believe here we believe right here amen now the world's going to fall the world is going to shake listen folks if we need a foundation we need that Foundation today we wake up in Good Moods wake up in bad moods some of us wake up in good moods and end up in bad moods amen it it it it just it this this old flesh amen is so tipsy tosy can you say amen amen and if you allow your faith and and and your your belief system to go up and down with that well you're never going to conquer anything you're never going to overcome anything last week we talking about overcoming amen the Holy Ghost is in you to overcome through you amen this is not a myth this is not something that amen that that a preacher just gets up makes you pumps you up and makes you feel good this is the realities of the word of God when placed in your heart with faith it'll produce everything that God said can you say amen amen now Hebrews 11 and6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he's not a myth that he's not a totem pole amen that he's not a an idol somewhere you you've got to believe that he truly is he's a living being there is a heaven and there is a Jesus setting In Heaven There is a reality to the things of God come on church amen we've got we we've got folks you know that has totally taken Jesus off the throne in the message amen saying you know you know saying that uh you know he's not on the throne and The Mercy Seat and all the that's just a bunch of baloney folks amen we've got to come to the reality we've got to accept God's word believe God's word in order to have the results how many wants results in your walk with God I I believe you do I know I want to I I want to see but he says you've got to believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him why do we come to church day in and day out sick or not sick or up or down whether we feel good hallelujah how many how many feels like coming to church every time you come to church we're not coming to church because we feel like coming to church we don't come early amen just because we feel like it we come early because the prophet said we should come early and that we should spend time in prayer why he says you need to prepare your heart for the service that is to come but if it's just a duty to you you're going to show up a 5 minutes after every time Hallelujah and you're going to say preacher love it or lump it Hallelujah see it's but it does not mean anything to the preacher the pre it don't matter to the preach you can live an overcoming life if you want and you can choose not to live an overcoming life you've got to take the things of God from the depths of the heart and if you know that he is and you know that he sent his Prophet then then you are willing to follow the guideline that God said would work and those who diligently seek Him will find him well glory to God don't you love him now so that heart that heart why why would the scripture say that you've got to keep that Heart Guard that heart is that not what we just read amen there there back back up to uh uh uh proverbs 4 amen was that the third chapter or was the 23rd chapter what was that where it says guard your heart guard your heart be diligent upon that heart why why why should you guard that heart amen keep the heart with all diligence because out of the heart not the mind out of the heart is where the issues of Life are going to come now the scripture says that the what that the heart amen can either be it can be the most deceitful thing Hallelujah so only only through guarding that heart placing the blood around that heart keeping that heart pure before God well praise the Lorden there was another warning there in Hebrews 3 and12 says take heed Brethren lest there be any of you okay an evil heart of unbelief and depart from what l i v i n g the Living God now you can have it here and not have a living God hallelujah you can have all the dos and the don'ts and the ins and the outs and the ups and you can have it all down in your little suitcase and and in your little belief system all put away right here in the in the mind but only from the heart can you bring out the realities of the supernatural this mind is enmity against God it will never know God it will never believe God it will only reason God we are not here to reason with God we are here to walk with God and that can only come from the heart can you say Amen so so you your heart can be full of life and your heart can be full of death all the while sitting in this church can you say Amen listening to the same preacher Amen in the same quotes amen and and we don't want to do it from here we want to do it from here God does go God doesn't work through psychology God works amen through through a faith a heart of faith I told you it's going to be simple this morning but it's from the heart from the heart somebody says from the heart out of the abundance of the heart there's where God is looking at God came in and touched not the mind not the body but God redeemed the soul to himself and it's with that Soul or with that heart that he is going to communicate with you and move in the Supernatural Rim through you it's only through that which has been redeemed right that's right your body's not been fully redeemed yet no your spirit man's not been fully redeemed yet but that's okay as long as you've got God in that heart in that soul and you can believe there is nothing impossible to him him that believes I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what mama says I don't care what anyone else says as long as thy heart can see God's word and believe it it is yours man now we got to get that in our heart brother brandom says I'd like to draw your attention to the word of the Lord this morning for just a while I want you to pay the utmost attention to it listen closely the value of this word after 25 years of Ministry for the Lord in his work and in his word after being coming into my 12th year of international evangelism by the grace of God to meeting tens of thousands of people and seeing our Lord in all in our own campaigns now I have seen him or I've seen to him right in towards two million or million 500,000 somewhere along in there in the meeting uh sing them to the Lord I've come to this conclusion of all of our efforts and so forth it is impossible for God to do anything for the people until the people first get settled on whether it's truth or not oh ah that's coming from a prophet he says now now with all of Supernatural with all the Visions with all of the things that I've done I I I I i' I've been I've been doing this for 25 years this is 12th year in in in in the international evangelism and out of everything that has been done I have found that it is impossible for God to do anything until the people get it settled whether it's truth or not you're never going to get it settled here so don't ever try that don't don't even try that but that's something that God gave you at that new birth buddy you can put that in the bank and you'll work he'll work miracles with that he'll work miracles with that he will do the impossible in and through you if you will open that heart up to him well glory to God I said glory to God it don't matter whether you're a teenager whether you're old whether it does not matter if you can believe it there is no telling what God can do M Jesus said that in Mark 11:22 he said Jesus answering sayth unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say it to this mountain be removed and be thou cast into the sea and and now now here he's now he's given the two opposites and not doubt in his heart but shall be he says now there's going to be the opportunity for doubt and there's going to be the opportunity for Faith right but if you doubt not in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray what when you pray what believe believe that you receive them and you shall have them oh that heart is precious that heart is the most important thing you can have can you amen amen I I I believe in healing I believe in miracles I believe I believe that when God when God saved my soul that I have a right to believe God for healing in my body well the prophet said healing is the children's breath the doctors might say that it's incurable the doctors might say Amen that you don't that that you that that that that you've got to go down amen but that's not what What We believe We Believe What God Says amen hallelujah now if we could ever get it settled that the same God that saved my soul is the same God that can heal my body if we could ever get it in our heart that the only reason sickness came and death has come is because sin came into the soul right that's right so when you deal with the soul the spirit you have the authority to bring that Spirit man and that body under your control through faith in God's word hallelujah now you got to get it settled well brother when I I believe God can heal but I I just don't know if he if he really wants to do it I'm going to tell you right now God is wanting to heal you you more than you want to be healed God's wanting to bring this about can you say Amen brother Brandon would say of course any Christian believes that that's heard there' be a resurrection but if there's no attributes of the Resurrection if there's no Earnest of the Resurrection then there is no Resurrection now now God says he's given Supernatural proof If there's no Divine Healing then there's no Resurrection now you couldn't disprove that I I if uh if you could by Bible see I'm arguing the points of Christ see because we have the earnest of our Salvation which is the baptism of the holy spirit is that right that's the down payment that's the earnest which holds it secure in heaven for us and then if there is no Divine Healing to make a cancer written body come to normal and well again then there is no resurrection of the dead that's right we have no Earnest of it at all there's no plan made for it so that just settles it can you say amen hallelujah what did God say let's just let's just start let me let me deal with healing for a for a little for a little while here this morning we've got some folks in our church that need some healing how many needs healing in this building amen I know some people I know some of you in this in in in this in this place are are are are are are in dire need for God to do something doctors cannot help you that's right but I'm here to tell you your faith can touch the throne room of God and bring God's word to pass in your life can you say amen amen but there must be Faith to appropriate your healing now now just because healing is yours and healing is the children's bread doesn't mean that you're going to get healed just because the Bible says you have got to come through the means that God do you've got to come through the means of the blood brother in order to be saved you can't come through any other way you've got to do it the way God's word says to do it amen and that's the same way with healing can you say amen I want to tell you the promises of God are life to them that find them and the scripture says what we just read it there in proverbs 4 amen and and it is Health to all their flesh Exodus 23 and 5 or 25 23:25 we shall and ye shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee now now now we cannot presume we cannot just come and say that's a good thought yes yes yes yes God can do that it's got but but if your heart down here is is is is questioning well well I I you know I but I don't know but I I don't know if God can do it I'm too old I'm too young I'm too far gone I'm too this I'm too that God's never done it in the past I don't know if he can do it now there's got to come somebody that gets past the presuming that maybe God will do it and we've got to step up to the plate and say I believe God amen amen now I told you last week too many times people say I don't have the Holy Ghost amen because I'm still fighting temptation I don't have the Holy Ghost because I'm still fighting amen things in my walk with God I'm still bringing but you see amen Jesus was tempted Jesus had to overcome and so are you tempted and you're tried and we're not going to preach l last last week's sermon amen but you see the Holy Ghost within you will overcome the enemy because only then can you have true Faith to overcome amen are you hearing me now brother Brandon would say Moses never went down into Egypt presuming that God was with him he went down to Egypt knowing somebody say hallelujah hallelujah he went down into Egypt knowing that God was with him you don't accept your healing thinking God will do it you accept your healing because God has already done it he promised it and your faith says that it's so and nothing else can wipe it out someone say hallelujah hallelujah amen now is my Faith going to bring the healing about no no my faith is resting on the finished work of Calvary the debt of sin has already been paid and by his stripes I am already healed Hallelujah so when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is a faith not to the to the intellect but it's a faith that has been placed in your in in in your life Hallelujah it is the get out of jail card that you permanently carry around and when sickness comes in it's already been paid for it's already done you're not begging God to heal you you're not begging God to deliver you you're not begging God for some kind of Supernatural something to take place and I hope I can get right no you are stepping into the room where fa where where where healing and deliverance and salvation already is and you are exchanging your faith Han take that for her healing Hallelujah is that beautiful amen now if the pin the pin's already in her hand and and and she's already got now I want that pen everyone in this room wants that pen but then she says listen this pen is yours brother wend and then when and and she sent it to me in the mail now I put it right there and I'm holding it right there man and and and I I don't everyone's all the rest of you said oh man I'd like to have that pen right right but see I've got the buying power the pin is already mine you bunch of Beggars can beg all you want Hallelujah I've got what it is and I'm going to give her the card and I'm going to receive the pen faith is that easy it's already purchased healing is is already yours Deliverance is already yours it's already been paid for Jesus can do no more for you today than what he done 2,000 years ago Faith steps up to the plate Hallelujah faith comes by brother brandom says your faith is what happened to you at the new birth you now have the ability to see things God the way God sees you now have the ability to believe it to accept it and to take it as your very own well I think that's beautiful can you say Amen so the work is already down amen now so we're not thinking he's going to do it we accept our healing because it's already hours we have to go pick it UPL James 1:6 says let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways now what did we what what did we look at at Hebrews 11:6 amen what was what was what was the criteria without faith it is impossible to please him and he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who will diligently seek after himen oh brother I'm just telling you you don't have I know it's bigger than you I know your problems bigger than you I know your circumstances bigger than you I understand all of that it's big big big big and it's going to take you down but nothing is bigger than him he has already conquered it amen he has already done it now lift up your head amen and rejoice because the promise is yoursl can you say Amen now the return of God's righteous seed wi now I you know and I I I I I hope this isn't too slow for y'all this morning but this is the day of restoration we want to say oh but man back in the 1800s oh my all those fine men oh the power of God Smith Wigglesworth in the late eight late 1800s and early 1900s oh Smith Wigglesworth and oh H wow man powerful amen they weren't even living in the full restoration right we talk about 1906 Pentecost and we're going oh wow n the power of God that was just that that was that that was not full restoration yeah but we're living in the hour where the whole thing has come together we are living in the hour of restoration the very seed that went into the ground is now here in Bride form the very seed Jesus Christ The Royal son of Abraham is now got a bride here on this Earth that if you can believe the word of God and you can understand and accept that you are that word you are the manifestation you are the promise then you'll rise up in faith and possess your land praise the Lord in this age it says come up hither amen and I'll show you things that must be Hereafter now there's two works of the lamb and I'm not going to hold you long on this point there was the redeeming work of the lamb and then there's the claiming work of the Lamb how many knows the difference the redeeming work or the initiation of redemption was the lamb sacrifice on Calvary and he has come to pay the penalty he has come to cure you of your sickness he come to pay the penalty for your sin and it took care of everything underneath that penalty you die because Adam sinned you get sick because Adam sinned you have marriage problems because Adam sinned amen you fight Devils because Adam sinned so when Christ came when the lamb came and he gave his life he paid the penalty for all the condemnation that was held against you therefore there is nothing nothing the devil can condemn you with well he would heal you but God would touch your marriage but you could overcome but the butts are gone amen well I'm telling you right now this is your chance to get up and do a jit Hallelujah every every all of the condemnation all of the penalty was put on Jesus christall he whom the son sets free is what free inde Hallelujah now therefore there is no condemnation let's look here look look there he Romans 8 And1 hallelujah oh I love him therefore there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus how do you get in Christ Jesus you are baptized into Christ by the power of the holy spirit amen you are baptized into this body oh come on church he says I found no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit where does the spirit dwell what controls the flesh where does God's spirit dwell hallelujah what controls your flesh well praise the Lord faith is the substance faith is the evidence faith can move mountains faith if you believe these signs Will Follow You faith in my name you will cast out Devils through faith you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover none of that none of that could happen after Adam fell none of it no mortal man could ever stand up and claim them those scriptures until after the lamb initiated Redemption and when the lamb initiated Redemption all of the penalty of Adam's sin that you have on you is now put to the tree cursed is every man that hangeth on the tree he died for well I just want to shout right now because the devil just trying to make me think I can't do it when I can do it now the initiation of redemption was the lamb giving his life he initiated Redemption we've went through all this time we've went through all of this this ages through the power of the Holy Spirit but not in full restoration there was no restoration there coming out of the dark and now we've seen what had happened in the in the book of Acts the book of Acts was full of the power of the Holy Spirit Jesus it was showing that what Calvary done in the body of Jesus Christ now all of these other bodies plural was carrying the same life of God they were healing the sick they were raising the dead they were turning the world upside down even the very shadow of Peter was healing people but then the Dark Ages come along man and the tree and his brother bandam as as we shared the showed the other night brother brandom says it just it just took out the nub all the tree the big old the big old beautiful tree and it just took it all the way down to the nub all there was was the root and a little stub Hallelujah but God says I'm going to restore sayith the Lord the cankerworm has done it the korm has come the caterpillar has come the Locust has come for the r came in and told us that it's all the same insect just different stages All The Same Spirit of the Antichrist different stages but he says I will restore sayith the Lord and you will eat in plenty and you will come to fruits and and you will be everything that I've ordained you to be Hallelujah so here come Lu sanctification here com San justification then Here Comes sanctification and then Here Comes speaking in tongues and everyone's all go who man were Justified were Sanctified we're speaking in tongues and they didn't know what they had therefore they aborted the word and when the word came but the bride on the bride you and I are the reason for the plant everything that that first church was we are no weapon formed against you in my name you will cast out devils in My Name by his stripes you were healed now you've got to you've got to appropriate that somebody's got to stand up in this day this is not the initiation of redemption every church around is all talking about the initiation oh Jesus died for me Jesus died for me Jesus died and I'm so thankful but brother if you just stay back there 2,000 years ago we're just going to live forever in this in this in this cycle of death and Revival and death and Revival and death and Revival there's got to be the claiming work of the Lamb that steps up gives you the book and says go defeat the enemy I've anointed you to do [Applause] so can you say Amen so the completion of redemption when we seen the lamb yes the lamb was still bloody yes the lamb was still bleeding yes the lamb but the lamb is no longer back there dying now the bloody bleeding lamb has taken the book has opened the book sent it down to his seventh angel messenger and the seventh angel messenger Hallelujah now how many believes that you've got to believe believe that on don't put it here put it here because if you get it here you're going to be shaking Giants can you say amen hallelujah oh glory to God all right I need your help hallelujah amen Paul I'll use you too come on over here you're going going to be behind the pull pit Hallelujah come here Paul amen stand up there on but no no you're not going to stand you're going to you just sit sit Hallelujah now brother brandham uses the intercession Booth he says he says the lamb was in the intercessory Booth we never seen the lamb he man he's behind the veil he's he's there interceding for you and for me he's already paid the price amen but the promise was that the lamb amen that the mighty Angel the presence of God now he's still going to be seated right there doing that work of redemption but his Spirit was going to come to Earth hallelujah amen I want you to rise up as the spirit the mighty Angel is going to come and give the book Hallelujah he's been interceding interceding sit back down sit back down and and and and they're asking who can open the book John's weeping John's crying no one's worthy to open this book They're saying who can open that book hallelujah praise the Lord who can open that book and everyone's crying John brother bandam says the reason he's crying is because he knows that though the lamb paid for Redemption it would go on and on and on and on and on until the lamb claimed but then there was a voice that says there's one worthy he says I looked under the Earth no one was worthy I looked in the earth no one was worthy no one was worthy but then a lamb steps forward step up and the lamb takes the book and the lamb opens it open it up but what good is a book that is open in the hands of of the Lamb right he didn't die for himself right so he sent the book Revelations 10:7 and he gives it to the seventh angel Hallelujah you go sit there and keep on interceding Hallelujah the seventh angel is preaching an open book to the people [Applause] the mighty Angel is instructing the Earthly Angel the Earthly Angel is giving the message to the people last chapter of the Book of Revelations or or no no no no no last verse of the 10th chapter of Revelations praise the Lord here it is amen go go go up Revelations tell you what go ahead and go up to Revelations go to the eth e8th verse now now here's the voice here's the mighty Angel go go to seventh verse praise the Lord sorry guys I'm just I'm just preaching as it comes but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets now Redemption is fixed to be finished amen the mighty Angel has taken the lamb has already opened the book The Mighty Angel has come down to give the book amen and for those of you that that have a hard time with Revelations 10 brother bradam says the mighty angel will be on the Earth or the Earthly angel will be on the earth the same time that the mighty Angel comes it's the anointing that is coming down to reveal God's word to his people all right seventh verse again the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished you're no longer wondering whether you're saved you're no longer wandering if you can overcome you're no longer wandering now watch but just because the seventh angel is preaching and you're listening to the tapes and you're listening to brother Wendell don't mean that you're catching it it could be all right here it doesn't mean that okay it's already said but now watch and I Heard a Voice from Heaven spake unto me saying go take the little book which is already open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth the Earthly Angel is doing the preaching right the Heavenly Angel has got the Revelation you can hear the he the Earthly Angel and get it here but the problem is is we keep it right here and we get it right here but God's wanting you to know that hey I don't want this to be an intellectual thing the mighty Angel is right here why don't you come to God and ask for that divine revelation to go from here to right here so all things can become possible to you come on it's not here it's here oh if I could just listen I don't how is it that Stephanie who was a rank Sinner and didn't deserve anything from God she was just as rank as rank can be how is it that God could heal her when she was still battling habits when she was still battling things she didn't even she she was still learning God she was still well maybe you was already delivered from your habits by then you you were I mean God came down and touched her so God did God did deliver that so I'm not going to take away from that but she wasn't serving the lord for 120 years in order to get a brand new liver right she was an she was an Infidel she was she she loved claiming that she was atheist she loved she was proud of the fact and yet when she beli God God gave her a brand spanking new [Applause] liver how could that be she didn't know it here all right come on you see now if she was in Luther's day she would have believed that justification like no other because the anointing of justification was here if she was in Wesley's day and she got saved it would be like the anointing of sanctification boom it's already there she don't know nothing about it yet it's already there and then when the preacher as John Wesley begins to preach on the methods of Salvation and sanctification her heart's in yes yes yes yes yes she's under the sanctification anointing if you were to get receive it on at 1906 and and and that and that in in the in the in the in the early 19th century you will the 20th century you would find that the power of the Holy Spirit would come upon you to speak in tongues people said amen they say that they would just walk within two blocks people walking to work two block box of the isusa street and they would fall out under the power of God speaking in tongues they weren't schooling it it wasn't here God was coming down to touch his seed we're living in this open book we're living in the realities of restoration you don't have to have it here you've just got to believe from your heart and God will take care of the rapture God will take care of the body change God will take come on church it's in our faith believing his word the anointing for this hour will fall upon you hallu amen so the preacher preaches it more thankful and brother brandham brought it and listen it was brother brandham that brought this message of the open book to us and it's not brother brandham and then brother brandham gets off the center he has to scoot over and then I'm going to share the book with him and say I think you're a little bit wrong right there I you don't know I do you're a dumb Kian and I can tell you know I I believe the see the Greek says it don't matter what the Greek says it doesn't matter what anybody else says the ano the pillar of Fire amen whever that picture is with a pillar of fire is over his head not mine the mighty Angel is with him not me if I want the mighty angel with me then I've got you start preaching I've got to sit and listen to what God speaks through the seven thank you amen hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the Lord faith God wants to make sure amen someone go out there and get that get that Pillar of Fire real quick amen God wants to make sure that we've got something to Anchor well that's good hey never mind brother Harry we got it up here amen God wants to make sure that that faith is anchored in the realities of God all right y'all can be seated get give those guys a hand clap so the redeeming work of the lamb but this is the claiming work of the Lamb this is when the lamb is claiming what he died for he's called he'll always speak through a man so he comes and he speaks he always does he does nothing but through a man so he anoints a man to come and bring the Oracles of God now he can't just use a clergyman he can't use he can't just use anyone in the five-fold ministry amen those those have their they have their purpose but there's only one messenger per age that God chooses to reflect the anointing of the age to that people he builds that man that Prophet cannot fail his words will my words can fail fail your words can fail but God equips his man to speak and he expects you not to judge it you're required to judge me you're required to judge something when someone says something you'd better say h is that what the Bible says you're required prophecy has to be judged Visions have to be judged dreams have to be judged preachers have to be judged right but you never a prophet never stands before a tribunal he never stands before amen a group of men and say am I right if that were the case there were 400 of them told MAA you're wrong but God was with M there was a big group of them that stood against Jeremiah saying thus sayith the Lord and Jeremiah says maybe the Lord Lord spoke to you but I'll tell you what the Lord just told me brother bradam Hallelujah why you love him brother bradam told brother brother Bram come to uh brother shakarian sister and said you're going to die get your house in order you're going to die I seen you I I I I seen you you you'll die at at a certain time didn't give the date he M but said get ready huh I thought it was his sister but it could have been his wife yeah Florence I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty is is anyone is it his wife or his sister anyone know that's something we can look up amen I know one thing he did not marry his sister so he it's either his wife or his sister but but anyways well so um oh man it was it the the the message that brother bradam preaches I believe it is birth pains when brother brandham when brother brandham steps up to the platform now you don't know this is going on but you you can hear you can hear oh brother Brandon say oh the spirit of the Lord is moving strong tonight he said wow wonderful oh just a wonderful presence and you can hear everyone just all and and what had just happened is there was prophecies going on saying that Florence was going to live and brother brandham sitting there he goes he goes oh well oh that's just wonderful presence and then he says and the Lord showed me just nonchalantly now the Lord showed me the poor girl that that she will die and just goes on and then preaches birth pains after he gets out after he gets out you know they're they're all saying Oh Billy saying Billy saying those gu that anointing was there presence of God was strong oh my goodness dad and then you say are you sure and he turns around to Billy and he says Florence shall die God always gives you something to base your faith upon you've got to believe that from the heart don't believe this message here believe this message here amen well some of you are y'all still questioning are you still asking well did she live or did she die she died she did exactly the way the word of the Lord came so you can have your emotions and your ups and you're day listen you can have your emotions and you're shouting and your prophecies and all those things and I believe every bit of it but there is one anchor one anchor someone say uno uno one anchor for your faith and it's the word of God Amen and it's this age that God came to give us that word so that our Faith could be restored oh come on now amen so at this end time there's been 2,000 years of inter of of of intercession amen the Lambs paid the price but in this day the lamb has come taken the book opened it up amen ripped off the seals handed to the seventh angel are you following me declares it to the seventh Church age she goes to the Angel takes the book eats it up and then she begins to prophesy she begins to say the same thing that the seventh angel said sir and she begins to see the same victory that the same angel that the seventh angel had can you say Amen well glory to God do you love him amen so consider brother brenon would put this he says now he says he says uh on Sunday night we give we give over to pray for the sick l in 65 he says and have a prayer line as as as we can get one here we are dedicating this service tonight for the prayer for the sick and I want you to get built up now in the hor holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour somebody say the faith of this hour it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be the rapturing faith to be taken up so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it be of God or not now there's a reason he's doing this we're fixing to have a healing service and if you can accept that there is something Supernatural in this building and this message is Supernatural am i' the Lord has put this out there he's plastered around if you can accept it and if you can get it in your heart that it is the truth you can have your healing tonight this is the age of not guessing it's the age of restoring it's the age of full faith in the word of God hallelujah well can you say amen amen now we've got brother Brandon would say we've got to have Divine Healing for the earnest of our complete deliverance if there's no Divine Healing there is no resurrection of the Dead how about that teacher if there's no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection if the holy spirit is here that is the earnest of our eternal life do you believe that the reason that God included Divine Healing how could you take it out of the Gospel when he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we were healed the same blood from the same man on the same day I love it the same blood from the same man on the same day he said one for salvation one for healing to deny one is to deny the other now I believe that there is a reality there's a reality now when Adam died and I'm going to I'm I'm closing I'm I'm I'm I'm nowhere near my end so I'm just going to I'm going to pause here in just a minute the result of the curse it says in the day that you eat you shall surely die that was a compound meaning it was instantaneous the Soul's eye was closed it was spiritual death Adam lived on how how long did Adam live another 900 years I how eight and we know a thousand years is one day with God so we understand that it was twofold but Adam's Soul the spiritual death happened immediately the physical death happened amen 900 and something years later can you say Amen now the spiritual death is the lack of the ability to believe Heaven's channel was closed up Adam could no longer have the faith he had no longer had the faith to say to this tree to move he was no longer had the faith to stand there to to Leo the line now he's running from Leo now he he's no longer speaking to the storm now he's running from the storm he no longer has the faith the spiritual sense of Adam died closed he could no longer fellowship with God his super Rim his Supernatural ability to go into those that other rim of the unknown and to believe God listen friends what we' seen in the prophet and the supernatural of that that's way every one of us were built we were all built to communicate with God no longer aware of the new Angels no longer aware of the supernatural no longer aware of any of those things the physical death came disease amen is the penalty of death is that right sickness is part of the curse blindness cancer diabetes high blood pressure deafness blind eyes all of these things are all the results the attributes of death you are born to die don't care how good-looking you boys are you're going to start hurting you're going you're going to you're going to go downhill quick think you miss squirrels now Hallelujah wait till you get as blind as me amen So when you say I believe God for my salvation can I have confidence to believe God for my healing I say yes we can amen now I am looking for a place to pull over right now hallelujah amen you love him praise the Lord amen let's just have the musicians to come how many understands my point what I was preaching on here this morning healing is part of it you can now I I and I and I I I'm wanting to touch on healing here and and maybe if the Lord be willing he'll allow me to to continue my thoughts and to finish this for this evening because I think it's I think it's I think it's beautiful but I'm wanting to hit it's it's it's it's in you it's not outside of you it's on the inside of you that's the reason why I I I sung the song this morning Jesus on the inside working on the outside it's from the heart it's from the heart of man that brings the healing to man it's from the heart of man salvation comes it's from the heart of man you you you you'll never convince God enough to bring healing to you he's already done it huah now what we want to do is Lord let window Martin get past this little PE brain let me get past this hindrance this enmity the mind is enmity with God let me get past this mind let me get to that heart and let that heart really be energized therefore I'm not fighting for healing I'm fighting all of the resistance of the enemy so that I can get to my healing we're not begging God to heal us what we're need to do is fight all of those Devils between you and your healing the enemy there telling you that you can't the enemy telling you well the doctor said the enemy sitting there telling you all of that you have got to get past pass those things and you're only going to be able to do that by taking the sword of the spirit from the heart and defeat the enemy and get to that point healing is yours victory is yours salvation is yours salvation was yours when you were out the bar salvation's always been yours but you had to get to the point where you could get to Calvary and I I I want to say this morning you don't you don't have to do a amen a a seven-point prayer you don't have to do a
