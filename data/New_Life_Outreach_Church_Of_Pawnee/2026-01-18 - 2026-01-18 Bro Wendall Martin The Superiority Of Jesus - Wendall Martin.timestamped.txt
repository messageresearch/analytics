[50:35] Lord, we don't know the storms and the
[50:39] trials that she will face. We we have no
[50:44] way of looking into the future.
[50:48] But Lord, you've already been in her
[50:51] future.
[50:53] And we're asking, Father, that your
[50:56] divine Holy Spirit
[51:00] would be upon this baby
[51:03] and that you would keep her all the days
[51:05] of her life.
[51:08] Lord, that your presence would would be

[51:26] Lord as a mighty woman of God.
[51:31] Oh Lord,

[52:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't she just a This baby is such a
[53:03] beautiful Look at that little Indian
[53:05] head right there. Get a picture of that
[53:07] right there. Amen.
[53:12] She's beautiful.
[53:16] Amen.
[53:17] God bless y'all. Praise the Lord.
[53:21] Amen.
[53:25] Well, we uh I I think it's wonderful as
[53:30] we have seen so many babies that have
[53:33] been dedicated to the Lord and um uh
[53:37] over the years and and uh mamas and
[53:41] daddies, there is quite um a
[53:43] responsibility that comes with raising
[53:46] our children. Can you say amen?
[53:49] You know, the Apostle
[53:51] John says, "Now,
[53:54] amen. Faith is wonderful, but we've got
[53:57] to have works with our faith." And so,
[53:59] what we're saying, the Abraham believed
[54:03] God. Amen. But his his following God in
[54:09] obedience to his word, Amen, is what
[54:12] sealed the deal for for Isaac and the
[54:14] blessings upon them. And so we are we
[54:19] are thankful, amen, to have God's
[54:22] blessings up upon our uh
[54:27] upon his upon his word.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we are believing in. Well,
[54:32] let's look here in the scriptures and um
[54:36] we're going to look here in Hebrews the
[54:38] first chapter. Like to um say it's it is
[54:42] good to be back home. this this um my my
[54:45] in-ear dealer just keeps static and it's
[54:48] just fuzzing in and out. I don't know um
[54:51] if I'm on the if I've gone on the wrong
[54:53] channel or or what it is, but it just
[54:56] goes
[54:58] well. No, I'm getting something, but it
[55:00] just act it just keeps fading out and
[55:01] then coming back. I don't I I don't know
[55:04] what that is. Like right now I have
[55:07] nothing. Oops. There I got something
[55:09] there. You know, it's just Hallelujah.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:14] Um, so we'll look here in Hebrews 1 and8
[55:20] and uh or 1 and 1, I'm sorry. And we're
[55:23] going to read down to the eth verse. It
[55:25] says, "God, who at sunundry times and
[55:28] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[55:31] the fathers
[55:32] by the prophets,
[55:35] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[55:37] by his son, whom he hath appointed heir
[55:42] of all things,
[55:44] by whom also he made the worlds, who
[55:49] being the brightness of his glory and
[55:52] the express image of his person,
[55:55] and upholding all things by the word of
[55:58] his power. When he had by himself purged
[56:01] our sins, sat down on the right hand of
[56:06] the majesty on high,
[56:08] and being made much better than the
[56:12] angels, he hath by inheritance
[56:15] obtained a more excellent name than
[56:18] they. For unto which of the angels said
[56:22] he, at any time, thou art my son, this
[56:27] day have I begotten thee? And again, I
[56:30] will be to him a father, and he shall be
[56:32] to me a son. And again, when he bringeth
[56:36] in the first begotten into the world, he
[56:38] saith, and let all the angels of God
[56:41] worship him. And of the angels he saith,
[56:45] he maketh his angel spirits, and his
[56:48] ministers a flame of fire. But unto the
[56:52] Son he saith, Thy throne, oh God, is
[56:57] forever and ever. A scepter of
[57:00] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[57:03] kingdom. I I would like to speak this
[57:07] morning on the uh superiority of Jesus
[57:11] Christ. He's higher than the angels.
[57:14] He's higher than the prophets. He's
[57:16] higher than anything. He is God. Let's
[57:20] go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we
[57:22] want to thank you this morning for for
[57:24] your great love to us and your mercies
[57:28] that that renew every morning. And
[57:32] Father, we're asking that your Holy
[57:35] Spirit would come, Lord, in a among us.
[57:39] Just settle among us, Lord, in a in a
[57:42] solid way. Father, Lord, teach us your
[57:45] word and may your grace be with us. We
[57:48] thank you Lord for your healing power
[57:50] upon all Lord that we have been praying
[57:53] for Father
[57:55] asking Lord that you would Lord good to
[57:57] see brother Donald and we're just still
[57:59] believing for that for that foot Lord
[58:02] and that healing Father just believing
[58:04] for a miracle actually and Lord we just
[58:07] look to you now in the name of the Lord
[58:10] Jesus. Can the church say amen?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be
[58:18] seated.
[58:19] So I I uh as I as I um
[58:26] have have contemplated on ministering
[58:29] here and it just uh don't really know
[58:32] which way it'll go this this morning as
[58:34] far as the book of Hebrews is a is an
[58:37] incredible um is an incredible book. And
[58:42] um I I was as we look through this first
[58:45] chapter going into
[58:48] uh uh the the book the apostle Paul.
[58:52] Amen. Who we believe was the the writer
[58:56] to the church. There is uh or to the
[58:58] writer of this book. Uh there's many
[59:01] that that that question it and um but
[59:05] but most of the um most of the scholars
[59:10] uh do believe that that the the Apostle
[59:13] Paul and the prophet uh said he believed
[59:16] that it was the the Apostle Paul who
[59:19] wrote the book of Hebrews um because of
[59:23] the characteristics.
[59:24] um it was the it was the same uh
[59:27] throughout the others and uh the other
[59:30] books. And so um so the the apostle Paul
[59:34] here is is separating
[59:37] uh a law from grace. And he's he is he
[59:41] is trying to to show that that we that
[59:45] we have something greater than that of
[59:48] the Old Testament.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. that and he's and he's his desire
[59:54] in the book of Hebrews is to show that
[59:56] Christ is superior. He is superior to
[1:00:00] all of the the types and the shadows of
[1:00:04] of the Old Testament. And so and and the
[1:00:07] Apostle Paul, he he he he it wasn't that
[1:00:10] just a man could do it, but the Bible
[1:00:12] says that Paul was separated from his
[1:00:16] mother's womb. Amen. to to uh to be a
[1:00:20] minister, to be an apostle, an a scent
[1:00:24] one. And of course, we understand that
[1:00:27] that he was more than just an apostle,
[1:00:30] but he was a word prophet. Amen. For he
[1:00:33] divided the word. He he brought clarity
[1:00:37] to Amen. the the the the word and
[1:00:40] divided law and grace. And so as as this
[1:00:45] man, the apostle Paul was raised under
[1:00:48] the great Gale and and um uh who was a
[1:00:52] very highly respected Pharisee. Amen. Uh
[1:00:56] Gale was a member of the the Jewish high
[1:00:59] council, the Sanhadrin. And and so
[1:01:02] Apostle Paul says that he was raised up
[1:01:05] under him. He was, Amen. from from uh
[1:01:08] from from a a very bo young boy raised
[1:01:12] up under his teaching. And so he was he
[1:01:16] Paul had a a good understanding of the
[1:01:18] law and and the traditions of the of of
[1:01:22] the Jewish people. Amen. And so uh you
[1:01:27] know in and there in the book of acts
[1:01:30] when he's talking to a grippa you know
[1:01:32] he says I was taught according to the
[1:01:34] perfect manner of the law. But you see,
[1:01:38] when when Paul had that experience on
[1:01:41] the road to Damascus while traveling to
[1:01:44] persecute the followers of Jesus, there
[1:01:47] the the the bright light appeared unto
[1:01:50] Paul and and and it was so great that he
[1:01:54] fell off of his horse and and the great
[1:01:56] light would would speak to him and he
[1:01:58] would say, "Uh, Saul, SAUL, WHY
[1:02:02] PERSECUTEST thou me?" Yeah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Now, the Apostle Paul knew that that
[1:02:07] great light had to have been Jehovah. He
[1:02:10] had been studied in it. So, he when he
[1:02:13] responded to this light, man, he is he's
[1:02:17] he's confused because he is doing what
[1:02:20] he feels is the work of Jehovah. Yet
[1:02:24] Jehovah knocks him off his horse and
[1:02:26] he's looking into this light and Jehovah
[1:02:29] is saying, "Why are you persecuting me?"
[1:02:32] YEAH.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; AND SO PAUL IS CONFUSED. HE He is a
[1:02:36] devout Jew. He is carrying out the
[1:02:39] perfect manner of the law as he had been
[1:02:42] taught.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; AND NOW THIS GREAT LIGHT, this great
[1:02:46] Jehovah that he is defending is saying,
[1:02:49] "You're persecuting me."
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the the SO WHAT HIS
[1:02:54] RESPONSE IS, JEHOVAH, AMEN. Who who art
[1:02:59] thou? What? Amen. And he he he he's
[1:03:02] asking who art thou? He calls him Lord
[1:03:05] Jehovah. And and the response was I am
[1:03:10] Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And the apostle Paul would forever more
[1:03:16] be he was taken back.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this great light whom he
[1:03:23] knows is the great Jehovah is now saying
[1:03:27] that he is Jesus. WELL, THIS EXPERIENCE
[1:03:31] so changed him. It's so it's so that the
[1:03:35] Bible says that he did not even go to
[1:03:38] Jerusalem. Amen. He went immediately. He
[1:03:41] went away for 3 years into the deserts
[1:03:44] of Arabia. And he stood he sat there in
[1:03:47] these in these desert AND WAS GOING BACK
[1:03:50] THROUGH ALL OF THESE OLD SCROLLS, going
[1:03:53] back through everything that he had
[1:03:55] learned as the Holy Spirit be to show
[1:03:58] him that these were types and shadows of
[1:04:03] the reality that was to come.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, brother John. It's good
[1:04:07] to see you home. Hallelujah. And um so
[1:04:11] amen he he and and and and now he did
[1:04:14] know this one thing. Amen. The the
[1:04:18] apostle uh Paul knew that that any
[1:04:22] teaching or anything that that the that
[1:04:25] there was once called uh the the urum
[1:04:28] and thumbum.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; And and this would be to where it would
[1:04:32] it was also called the breastplate of
[1:04:35] judgment. And so anything that one would
[1:04:38] consider to be of God, they would bring
[1:04:41] it before the urum thumbum which the
[1:04:43] high priest wore. And and and and if it
[1:04:47] was correct, it would light up. If it
[1:04:49] wasn't cracked, it would not light up.
[1:04:51] Amen. And so uh and it had been many
[1:04:54] years since the urum thumbum had had
[1:04:57] been uh a had been uh uh uh used. Amen.
[1:05:03] And but but he was taught enough that
[1:05:07] anything needed to go back to the
[1:05:10] scripture. And so he began to take this
[1:05:13] he took the Old Testament AND BEGIN TO
[1:05:16] RUN it back. Amen. the things that he
[1:05:20] had heard, the things about this Christ,
[1:05:22] the and the Holy Spirit would take him
[1:05:25] back to SCRIPTURE AND WOULD SHOW HIM THE
[1:05:29] SHADOWS were being fulfilled in the
[1:05:33] positive through Jesus Christ. Well,
[1:05:36] praise the name of the Lord. And I just
[1:05:37] want to say today that the urum thumbum
[1:05:40] of today, the breastplate of judgment is
[1:05:44] still God's word.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; And any belief
[1:05:48] There you go.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Any belief that we have or anything that
[1:05:53] we base our faith upon, we need to come
[1:05:56] back, amen, to the judgment, which is
[1:05:58] God's word. And there is how WE JUDGE.
[1:06:02] AND SO WHEN IT WHEN IT CAME, THERE WAS
[1:06:05] SOMETHING THAT SO STRUCK the this this
[1:06:08] this great man of Saul. This great man
[1:06:13] who was head and shoulders above his
[1:06:15] peers. SUCH AN INCREDIBLE man in that
[1:06:18] denomination. Amen. And it was so great
[1:06:21] that when giving a g giving an a an
[1:06:24] account there in Philippians 3 and 7, he
[1:06:27] says, "What things were gained to me?
[1:06:29] Those things I counted loss for Christ.
[1:06:33] Yay, doubtless. And I count all things
[1:06:36] but loss for the excellency of the
[1:06:40] knowledge of Christ my Lord. For whom I
[1:06:43] have suffered the loss of all things and
[1:06:46] do count them but dung that I may win
[1:06:51] Christ. Oh, can you say amen? So the
[1:06:54] whatever it was that the Apostle Paul
[1:06:56] seen, Amen. that it it changed him.
[1:07:00] Amen. There in Galatians 1 and 11, it
[1:07:03] says, "But I certify you, brethren, that
[1:07:05] the gospel which was preached of me is
[1:07:08] not after man. For I neither received it
[1:07:12] of man, NEITHER WAS I TAUGHT IT, but by
[1:07:16] the revelation of Jesus Christ. For ye
[1:07:19] have heard of my conver uh my con uh
[1:07:21] conversation
[1:07:23] in the past in the Jews religion, and
[1:07:26] how that beyond measure I persecuted the
[1:07:28] church of God and wasted it and profited
[1:07:31] in the Jews religion above my equals in
[1:07:34] my own nation, being more exceedingly je
[1:07:37] uh zealous of the traditions of my
[1:07:39] fathers. But when it pleased God, who
[1:07:42] separated me from my mother's womb, and
[1:07:45] called me by his grace, to reveal his
[1:07:48] son in me, that I may preach him among
[1:07:52] the heathen. Immediately I conferred not
[1:07:55] with flesh and blood, neither went I up
[1:07:58] to Jerusalem to them to uh uh to them
[1:08:01] which were apostles before me. But I
[1:08:03] went into Arabia, returned again into
[1:08:05] Damascus. Then after three years I went
[1:08:07] up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode
[1:08:09] with him 15 days. But the other apostles
[1:08:12] saw I none save James the Lord's
[1:08:14] brother. AND SO SO THE APOSTLE PAUL is
[1:08:18] is is declaring amen that that that this
[1:08:22] there was there was an a a a deep
[1:08:25] revelation. Of course we understand amen
[1:08:27] that the Apostle Paul uh is is the
[1:08:29] writer of the New Testament. Amen. Now
[1:08:32] there's some scribes and there's Mark,
[1:08:34] Luke, John. There's Amen. Matthew, you
[1:08:36] know, there there there's the book of
[1:08:38] Acts. We've got we've got a few of these
[1:08:40] other accounts. But the doctrines was
[1:08:43] established by the Apostle Paul. God
[1:08:47] raised this man up. Amen. To declare.
[1:08:50] And so, SO HERE THIS PROPHET is is is
[1:08:55] calling to the to to to the Hebrews.
[1:08:58] Amen. And he's and he's and he and he's
[1:09:01] telling them now THIS CHRIST IS NOT JUST
[1:09:06] AN ANGEL OF THE PAST. He's not JUST
[1:09:09] AMEN. THE PROPHETS. DON'T GET THEM MIXED
[1:09:11] UP. HE'S NOT JUST A PROPHET.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; He's not just an angel. Amen. But this
[1:09:18] was the very God manifested in the
[1:09:22] flesh.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; And so when he when he starts Amen. He
[1:09:28] he he he you know the the the first
[1:09:31] verse God who at sunundry times and
[1:09:34] diverse manners spake in times past to
[1:09:38] the fathers by the prophets and and and
[1:09:42] he he he would in in other words he
[1:09:45] would say God in the different times and
[1:09:48] periods. Amen. He he declared that uh uh
[1:09:53] you know there you know you would have
[1:09:55] the the uh the patriarchal uh Abraham,
[1:09:59] Isaac, Jacob, uh uh uh you know, Joseph.
[1:10:04] Amen. God would come and reveal himself
[1:10:08] through them. There would be the spirit
[1:10:10] of Christ that that would come down. You
[1:10:13] look at their a mosaic period and the
[1:10:15] the giving of the law. Amen. It was it
[1:10:19] was the spirit of Christ coming in and
[1:10:22] and and and living himself out.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. God raising up men and declaring
[1:10:29] his plan and HIS PURPOSE. BUT IT WAS
[1:10:31] ALWAYS MURKY. IT WAS ALWAYS IT WAS
[1:10:33] ALWAYS it was a type and shadow. In
[1:10:36] fact, uh there in in uh uh Revelations
[1:10:41] 12, you know, if if you were to read
[1:10:43] there in Revelations 12, and you could
[1:10:45] put it up there, say this uh 12 and 1.
[1:10:49] Amen. It says, "And there appeared a
[1:10:51] great wander uh in heaven and a woman
[1:10:54] with clothed with a sun and the moon
[1:10:57] under her feet and upon her head a crown
[1:11:01] of 12 stars." Well, that's Amen. That's
[1:11:03] the Orthodox church. That's the this
[1:11:05] this great Orthodox church coming up.
[1:11:08] Amen. The sun over her head. This was
[1:11:11] THE SUNLIGHT OF THE GOSPEL that was
[1:11:13] coming. The moon under her feet. That
[1:11:16] was the types and shadows of of the law.
[1:11:20] Amen. The 12 uh uh stars crowned. THAT
[1:11:23] WAS THE 12 APOSTLES. AMEN. And their
[1:11:27] doctrines.
[1:11:28] And and and THEN THE SECOND VERSE WOULD
[1:11:30] SAY THAT SHE was to give birth to a a a
[1:11:34] child travailing in birth and pain to be
[1:11:37] delivered. And and and and then we KNOW
[1:11:40] THE GREAT DRAGON WAS TO COME and and and
[1:11:43] would uh uh uh UH TRY TO DEVOUR THIS
[1:11:47] THIS this uh uh woman and THIS CHILD.
[1:11:50] AND SO THESE THIS WAS A TYPE. GOD
[1:11:53] LETTING THIS KNOW that the church, amen,
[1:11:57] WAS WAS STANDING UPON THE LAW. AMEN.
[1:12:02] Didn't do it away. But the moon is
[1:12:04] always the lesser light. You can't see
[1:12:06] as good with the moon. BUT WHEN THE
[1:12:08] SUNLIGHT COMES, AMEN. the moon sort of
[1:12:11] fades away. SO THE LAW WAS A WONDERFUL
[1:12:16] PRECURSOR. IT WAS A WONDERFUL LIGHT in
[1:12:19] its time. BUT WHEN THE GOSPEL LIGHT COME
[1:12:23] then you could see what the what the
[1:12:26] moon had been reflecting. AND SO THE THE
[1:12:30] OLD TESTAMENT IS NOT SOMETHING FOREIGN
[1:12:32] to us. THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS SIMPLY THE
[1:12:36] DARK SHADOWS OF OF WHAT THIS MESSIAH
[1:12:40] WOULD LOOK LIKE in the sunlight. AND
[1:12:43] WHEN THE SUN CAME, AMEN, THE GOSPEL
[1:12:46] LIGHT COME. AND THIS IS WHAT THE APOSTLE
[1:12:47] Paul is doing. He is saying, "AMEN.
[1:12:50] WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE OLD DARK
[1:12:52] SHADOWY PLACES ANYMORE. CHRIST IS NOW
[1:12:56] STANDING ILLUMINATED. IT'S NOT THE OLD
[1:12:59] AMEN. AN ANGEL APPEARING to a prophet
[1:13:02] and these KINDS OF THINGS, BUT we're
[1:13:04] seeing the very expression of God in the
[1:13:08] body of Jesus Christ."
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you all understand that? So,
[1:13:11] the Old Testament FIGURES THAT WHAT WE
[1:13:14] SEEN, YOU UNDERSTAND what I'm saying? I
[1:13:17] I I I know we we we we say it uh often,
[1:13:20] but you know, you you look to Adam. In
[1:13:23] other words, he would come to Adam and
[1:13:26] he would tell him the Messiah is going
[1:13:28] to come born of the woman's seed. Amen.
[1:13:33] And then then you'd see that and then
[1:13:35] Amen. And so that's why that that that's
[1:13:38] that's why Satan tried to kill Abel or
[1:13:40] that's why Satan killed Abel. Amen. He
[1:13:43] was trying to destroy the Messiah,
[1:13:47] trying to destroy the seed, but he
[1:13:50] couldn't destroy the seed. IT WAS A
[1:13:52] SUPERNATURAL SEED. Can you say amen to
[1:13:55] Abraham, he was told, Amen that the
[1:13:59] Messiah would come through his uh seed.
[1:14:03] Amen. to Jacob, he he said he he told
[1:14:05] HIM THAT THE MESSIAH WAS GOING TO come
[1:14:08] uh uh through the THROUGH THROUGH THE
[1:14:10] TRIBE OF JUDAH. TO DAVID, he said that
[1:14:14] he would come of his house. To Micah, he
[1:14:18] said that he would be born in Bethlehem.
[1:14:22] To to Isaiah, that he would be born of a
[1:14:26] virgin. And that his name would be
[1:14:28] called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
[1:14:31] Everlasting Father. Amen. the Prince of
[1:14:33] Peace. You see, the these WERE ALL THESE
[1:14:36] WERE ALL JUST LITTLE SHADOWY prophecies
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; that would be fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, they were looking they were
[1:14:48] looking to
[1:14:50] looking forward to a Messiah.
[1:14:54] We are looking through the Messiah.
[1:14:59] They were LOOKING IN THE DARK SHADOWS OF
[1:15:03] WHAT THIS Messiah would be. We are
[1:15:06] looking through the eyes of the Messiah.
[1:15:09] For we know exactly what the Old
[1:15:11] Testament was talking about.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for that? Could
[1:15:16] you imagine the kind of faith that was
[1:15:19] required in those Old Testament times
[1:15:21] and those Amen. But today we know who
[1:15:23] Christ is a and so this is what Amen. in
[1:15:27] times past he's revealed himself. Amen.
[1:15:30] He's in in in many parts and many ways
[1:15:33] that that's what that first verse is
[1:15:34] saying. Amen. SUNUNDRY TIMES AND AMEN
[1:15:38] DIVERSE MANNERS. WHAT HE'S SAYING IS
[1:15:40] amen parts, many ways. AMEN. THROUGH
[1:15:44] DREAMS, VISIONS, AUDIBLE VOICES, THIS
[1:15:47] THAT AND THE OTHER. IT WAS MYSTERIOUS
[1:15:50] TYPES AND SHADOWS.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:15:56] And each generation would die looking
[1:15:58] forward to that Messiah to come. Would
[1:16:01] look forward to that Messiah to come.
[1:16:03] Hallelujah. Oh my. And how it was. I
[1:16:06] mean you you know we we talk about it
[1:16:08] often but I we you know I uh uh uh
[1:16:11] Christ expressed in Moses.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The lawgiver, right?
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ expressed as as the priest.
[1:16:18] Moses standing before uh uh between
[1:16:21] judgment and life.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, look at look at the spirit
[1:16:25] of Christ expressed through Joseph. And
[1:16:28] I know we've went through some of these
[1:16:29] areas, but I just want to go back
[1:16:30] through it again because this is this is
[1:16:32] what the Apostle Paul is trying to say.
[1:16:36] Yes, he has spoke to us through THE
[1:16:39] PROPHETS. IT doesn't mean that he does
[1:16:42] not use prophets today. It is simply
[1:16:46] AMEN THAT IT WAS ALL THE TYPES. THAT'S
[1:16:49] ALL WE HAD WAS THE PROPHETS AND THE
[1:16:52] TYPES. ALL WE HAD WAS WAS TO, you know,
[1:16:55] even even look there at Joseph. Amen. As
[1:16:58] as as as Joseph, Amen. was the favored
[1:17:01] of his father. Amen. Then then then look
[1:17:03] at Christ. Amen. And he was given a coat
[1:17:06] of many colors. Well, Jesus is the
[1:17:08] favored of his father. And he wears the
[1:17:11] rainbow uh COVENANT OF GOD. JOSEPH WAS
[1:17:15] HATED BY HIS JEALOUS BROTHERS. AMEN.
[1:17:18] Just as Jesus was. and and and and and
[1:17:22] they tried to undermine him at every
[1:17:24] junction. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH WAS SOLD for 30 pieces of silver.
[1:17:29] SO WAS JESUS. JOSEPH WAS LIED AGAINST
[1:17:33] AND THROWN INTO PRISON. JESUS WAS LIED
[1:17:36] AGAINST and went to hell. AMEN. THERE
[1:17:39] THERE. BUT YOU YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
[1:17:41] BUT THERE WAS MORE TO IT THAN JUST THAT.
[1:17:44] HALLELUJAH. JOSEPH WHILE IN PRISON THERE
[1:17:46] WAS THE BUTLER AND THE baker that that
[1:17:49] that were thrown in prison as well.
[1:17:51] Amen. And Joseph told him that one of
[1:17:53] them would be exalted and the other one
[1:17:55] would die. Hallelujah. Jesus while
[1:17:57] hanging upon the cross there were two
[1:17:59] thieves IN THE SAME STORY. ONE ONE WENT
[1:18:02] TO HELL AND ONE WAS EXALTED with Jesus
[1:18:05] when he went to the throne.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, GLORY TO GOD. EVERYWHERE JOSEPH
[1:18:09] WENT, AMEN. WHEN WHEN HE COME OUT OF THE
[1:18:12] PRISON, HE WAS EXALTED TO THE RIGHT HAND
[1:18:15] OF PHARAOH. AND EVERY TIME FA UH JOSEPH
[1:18:19] WOULD WALK THROUGH EGYPT, AMEN, THERE
[1:18:21] WAS A CRY, BOW THE KNEE TO JOSEPH. WHY?
[1:18:24] JOSEPH WAS REPRESENTED. HE WAS THE
[1:18:27] SECOND. WELL, GLORY TO GOD. HE WAS NEXT
[1:18:30] TO PHARAOH.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT JESUS. JESUS WAS EXALTED. AMEN.
[1:18:35] HE WENT FROM THE DUNGEONS OF HELL AND
[1:18:37] WAS EXALTED TO THE VERY HIGHEST OF THE
[1:18:39] HIGHEST in heaven.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says at the name of Jesus,
[1:18:43] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[1:18:46] shall confess.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; WELL, PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT BUT ALSO WATCH THIS. JOSEPH,
[1:18:53] AMEN. WHILE HE WAS THERE, THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:18:56] THAT JOSEPH MARRIED A GENTILE WOMAN. SHE
[1:19:00] MARRIED A GENTILE WOMAN. AMEN.
[1:19:02] HALLELUJAH. IT WAS A TYPE OF ME AND YOU.

[1:19:14] TO SHOUT. AMEN. WATCH THIS. AMEN. WHERE
[1:19:16] WHERE WAS JOSEPH'S WIFE WHEN HE revealed
[1:19:20] himself to HIS BROTHERS?
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH'S WIFE WAS IN THE palace when
[1:19:25] when Joseph revealed himself to his
[1:19:29] rebellious brothers who had killed him.
[1:19:31] and and and and WHERE IS THE BRIDE GOING
[1:19:33] TO BE? THE BRIDE, JESUS CHRIST'S BRIDE,
[1:19:36] IS GOING TO BE RAPTURED AND IN THE
[1:19:38] PALACE WHEN JESUS COMES BACK TO EARTH
[1:19:41] AND REVEALS HIMSELF to his brothers. And
[1:19:45] they're going to AND THEY'RE GOING TO
[1:19:46] SAY, "WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE SCARS?
[1:19:49] WHERE DID YOU GET WHERE WHERE DID THIS
[1:19:52] HAPPEN?" AND JESUS IS GOING TO SAY, "In
[1:19:54] the house OF MY BRETHREN." MY IN OTHER
[1:19:57] WORDS, MY BROTHER SOLD ME. OH,
[1:20:01] HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT DID BUT ANOTHER
[1:20:03] THING I WANT YOU TO TAKE ON ABOUT
[1:20:05] JOSEPH. AMEN. THAT THE BIBLE SAYS JOSEPH
[1:20:08] LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID, "YOU MEANT IT
[1:20:10] FOR MY HARM, BUT GOD MEANT IT for
[1:20:13] posterity.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; YOU DONE IT IN YOUR JEALOUSY, BUT GOD
[1:20:18] DONE IT TO SAVE LIVES."
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; OH,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ARE ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME?
[1:20:25] AND THROUGH JESUS DEATH, THE Jews will
[1:20:29] be saved.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; There you are.

[1:20:34] Egyptians SPARED, THE GENTILE BRIDE
[1:20:37] SPARED, AMEN. WHO HAD BEEN CALLED OUT,
[1:20:40] BUT ALSO the Jewish brethren. And Jesus,
[1:20:43] WELL, I I JUST I SEE THESE ARE TYPES.
[1:20:46] AND AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL THING. AMEN.
[1:20:49] And it would take you could you COULD
[1:20:51] LOOK BUT YEAH UNTIL YOU SEE THE POSITIVE
[1:20:54] you don't know what the shadowy means.
[1:20:57] BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE POSITIVE YOU AND I
[1:21:00] CAN SHOUT AND REJOICE THIS MORNING
[1:21:03] because we can see it clearly through
[1:21:04] the life OF JOSEPH.
[1:21:07] THE APOSTLE PAUL SAYS, "UP TO THIS TIME
[1:21:11] IT WAS TYPES, SHADOWS, ANGELS, PROPHETS,
[1:21:15] BUT NOW WE SEE CHRIST. NOW WE SEE GOD
[1:21:21] MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH. IT TAKES away
[1:21:24] all the shadows."
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you here this
[1:21:29] morning. Amen. God's been talking about
[1:21:31] a bride, too. and this bride. All
[1:21:34] through the ages, we've known that it
[1:21:36] was going to come. We've known THAT
[1:21:38] SOMEHOW. OH, BUT WE'RE living in the day
[1:21:41] where we can see the fulfillment. WE CAN
[1:21:44] SEE THE REALITY OF THE WORD living in
[1:21:48] humans, men and women, boys and girls.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so when the famine went out,
[1:21:58] when there was a famine in Egypt, it was
[1:22:01] Joseph. Yeah.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Who had the corn?
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; And when there's a famine in Leosa,
[1:22:07] it is Joseph Jesus who has the corn
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; for the bride here today. Can you say
[1:22:13] amen? Hallelujah. Amen. And and to look
[1:22:16] at that, look look at the look look at
[1:22:18] our what our Joseph is going to do to
[1:22:20] his brothers. Amen. While while I've got
[1:22:22] I put these scriptures down just in case
[1:22:23] the Lord allowed us to go this way. But
[1:22:25] Amen. And and watch, he's going to give
[1:22:29] them the same atonement that his bride
[1:22:32] has. Now, think about that. THE SAME
[1:22:34] ATONEMENT THAT THE GENTILE bride who is
[1:22:37] in the palace is going to have has also
[1:22:40] going to be given, amen, to his
[1:22:43] brethren.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; They're going to be cleansed by the same
[1:22:46] blood. They're going to receive the same
[1:22:48] Holy Ghost. Amen. The Bible says there
[1:22:50] they're in Zechariah,
[1:22:53] excuse me. Amen. Uh 13 and1. In that day
[1:22:56] there shall be a fountain open uh to the
[1:22:58] house of David and to the inhabitants of
[1:23:00] Jerusalem for the sin and uncleanness.
[1:23:02] Hallelujah. It's going to be the same
[1:23:04] fountain that you've had, THE SAME
[1:23:06] FOUNTAIN THAT I'VE I'VE EXPERIENCED. And
[1:23:09] it shall come to pass in that day,
[1:23:11] sayaeth the Lord, I will cut off all the
[1:23:14] names of the idols out of the land, and
[1:23:16] they shall be no more remembered. And
[1:23:18] also, I will cause the prophets and the
[1:23:20] unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
[1:23:23] And it shall come to pass that when any
[1:23:26] shall yet prophesy, then his father and
[1:23:29] mother that begget him shall say unto
[1:23:31] him, "Thou shalt not live." For thou
[1:23:33] speakest lies in the name of the Lord,
[1:23:35] and his father and mother that begat him
[1:23:37] shall thrust him through when he
[1:23:39] prophes. It shall come to pass in that
[1:23:41] day that the prophet shall be ashamed,
[1:23:42] every one of of his vision when when he
[1:23:46] hath prophesied. Neither shall they wear
[1:23:48] a rough garment to deceive. BUT HE SHALL
[1:23:51] SAY, "I AM NO PROPHET. I am an
[1:23:53] husbandman." But for for man taught me
[1:23:56] to keep cattle from my youth. And one
[1:23:58] shall say unto them, "These are the UH
[1:24:01] UH WHAT ARE THE WOUNDS IN THINE HANDS?"
[1:24:05] And he shall answer those which with uh
[1:24:08] with which I was wounded in the house of
[1:24:11] MY FRIENDS. SO SO WHAT HE'S TRYING TO
[1:24:13] SAY, SEE VISIONS CAN CAN GO ONE WAY OR
[1:24:16] THE OTHER. PROPHECIES CAN GO ONE WAY OR
[1:24:18] THE ANGELS CAN GO ONE WAY OR the other.
[1:24:21] BUT YOU SEE, AMEN. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU
[1:24:23] HAVE THE WORD MADE FLESH, WHEN YOU HAVE
[1:24:27] THE GOD OF ALL GODS COME IN, AMEN. THE
[1:24:30] VERY FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECY. AMEN. THE
[1:24:33] VERY MANIFESTATION OF GOD. AMEN. ARE ARE
[1:24:36] YOU UNDERSTANDING ME? AMEN. WHEN YOU
[1:24:38] HAVE HIM STANDING RIGHT THERE BEFORE
[1:24:40] YOU, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. The old false
[1:24:43] prophets has to leave.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; The prophecies have to leave. Why?
[1:24:46] Because the word is living in in full
[1:24:50] color right there. I I I just thought
[1:24:52] that WAS WONDERFUL. THEIR EYES WILL BE
[1:24:55] OPEN. AMEN. And he will reveal who he
[1:24:59] is. And the Bible says that the that
[1:25:01] that the all of the inhabitants there,
[1:25:04] Amen. in Jerusalem will weep and cry as
[1:25:08] one who has lost a loved one. Praise the
[1:25:11] Lord. BUT IN THESE LAST DAYS, IN THESE
[1:25:15] LAST DAYS, HE HAS SPOKEN TO US BY HIS
[1:25:17] SON. HOW DID HE SPEAK? BY THE
[1:25:19] FULFILLMENT.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; God speaks by fulfillment.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. He speaks by fulfillment. In other
[1:25:26] words, you're no longer having to guess.
[1:25:27] It's no longer a type. IT'S NO LONGER A
[1:25:29] SHADOW. IT'S NO longer But when the real
[1:25:31] comes, Hallelujah. The real is there.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You you you you can have the
[1:25:38] shadows of my hand. Amen. And all you
[1:25:40] can see is a blur. You don't really
[1:25:41] can't really make it out. But the closer
[1:25:43] and the closer and the closer and the
[1:25:44] closer then I can tell. Hey, those are
[1:25:48] five fingers. Hey, that's why it's
[1:25:50] getting closer to the reality.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is not a type or a
[1:25:59] prefigure. Amen. If you there in Hebrews
[1:26:04] 14 and 4, it says, "But he is made so
[1:26:09] much better. He is made superior, amen,
[1:26:12] that to the angels a as by he hath by an
[1:26:16] inheritance obtained a far more
[1:26:20] excellent name than they. Hallelujah.
[1:26:23] It's it's incredible that today angels
[1:26:27] in the Pentecostal realm, everyone's
[1:26:29] seeing an angel. There's angels
[1:26:31] everywhere.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And while we thank God for angels, we
[1:26:33] thank God for angels. But the word has
[1:26:36] now come superior. The word was made
[1:26:40] flesh. Amen. Philippians 2:9. Amen.
[1:26:44] Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[1:26:48] him and given him a name above every
[1:26:52] name that at the name OF JESUS every
[1:26:56] knee should bow of things in heaven and
[1:26:58] things in the earth. Oh, can you say
[1:27:00] amen? Amen. and that every tongue every
[1:27:05] tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ
[1:27:08] is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; So, so this is what the Apostle Paul as
[1:27:16] we as we get in start getting into
[1:27:18] Hebrews, we're going to find that the
[1:27:20] entire book of Hebrews is the Apostle
[1:27:24] Paul separating the old from the new.
[1:27:28] His desire is his whole intent in this
[1:27:32] book is for you to understand that it's
[1:27:36] not doing away with the old.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is just simply separating the
[1:27:42] old so that you can understand the new.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; We're not doing We don't do away with
[1:27:46] the Old Testament.
[1:27:48] We are saying Christ FULFILLS
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; the Old Testament.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. AREN'T YOU GLAD
[1:27:57] FOR THAT? Now watch now watch as he goes
[1:28:00] on down. Let's let's just start let's
[1:28:01] just let's just start reading again
[1:28:03] Hebrews 1 and5. For unto which of the
[1:28:06] angels said he at any time, thou art my
[1:28:08] son. This day have I begotten thee? And
[1:28:12] again, I will be to him a father, and he
[1:28:16] shall be to me a son. And again, when he
[1:28:20] bringeth the first begotten into the
[1:28:22] world, he saith, let all the angels of
[1:28:25] God worship him. Of the angels, he
[1:28:28] saith, who maketh his his angels
[1:28:31] spirits, and his ministers a flame of
[1:28:34] fire? But unto the son, he says, thy
[1:28:39] throne, oh God, is forever and ever. A
[1:28:43] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[1:28:45] of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved
[1:28:48] righteousness and hated iniquity.
[1:28:50] Therefore God, even thy God, hath
[1:28:52] anointed thee with the oil of gladness
[1:28:55] above thy fellows. And thou, Lord, in in
[1:28:59] the beginning hast laid the foundations
[1:29:02] of the earth, and the heavens are the
[1:29:04] works of thine hands. And they shall
[1:29:08] perish, but thou remainest. AND THEY ALL
[1:29:11] WAX OLD as doth a garment, and as a
[1:29:14] vesture shalt thou fold them up, and
[1:29:17] they shall be changed, but thou art the
[1:29:20] same, and thy years shall not fail. NOW,
[1:29:24] THIS IS WHAT HE'S SAYING TO THE SON.
[1:29:25] THIS IS WHAT HE'S saying to the son. And
[1:29:28] as a uh but to which of the angels saith
[1:29:31] he at any time, sit on my right hand
[1:29:35] until I make thine enemies thy foottool?
[1:29:38] Are they not all ministering spirits
[1:29:41] sent forth to minister for them who
[1:29:43] shall be heirs of of salvation? So, so,
[1:29:46] so he's he's he's separated. Now, angels
[1:29:48] are are wonderful, but angels are
[1:29:51] ministers from God.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the very creator. AMEN. HE WAS
[1:29:58] THE VERY CREATOR. It was God in in
[1:30:02] Jesus.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was now
[1:30:05] uh uh on on on there they're in Mark 1
[1:30:08] and 12 or 1 and 13 when Jesus was in the
[1:30:12] wilderness. Mark 1:13 and he was there
[1:30:14] in the wilderness 40 days and tempted of
[1:30:17] Satan and was with the wild beasts and
[1:30:19] the angels ministered to the sun.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. John 1 and 51. Amen. He tells he
[1:30:27] tells uh Nathaniel, you will see angels
[1:30:30] ascending and descending upon upon the
[1:30:33] son of man. Amen. You look there at Luke
[1:30:36] 22 and42 Jesus in the in the garden.
[1:30:39] Amen. Uh in agony on on Mount of Olives
[1:30:43] and and and is saying, "Father, if thou
[1:30:46] be willing, remove this cup from me and
[1:30:48] nevertheless not my will but thy thine
[1:30:51] be done." And there appeared an angel
[1:30:55] unto him from heaven strengthening him.
[1:30:58] So the angels are ministering spirits.
[1:31:01] They are Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; But Jesus was God.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus was God. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:31:09] Brother Brandham would say, he'd say,
[1:31:10] God sends forth the angels. Glory. What
[1:31:13] are they? Ministering spirits. Glory.
[1:31:15] Ministering spirits sent where? From the
[1:31:17] presence of God. What to do? Minister
[1:31:20] His word.
[1:31:22] Is that's right?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; So, so but but he's asked TO WHICH OF
[1:31:26] THE ANGELS DID HE SAY TO SIT ON MY right
[1:31:29] hand until Amen. And and he says, but
[1:31:35] they're they're just angels. Did you
[1:31:36] know let me just say it like this? Let
[1:31:38] me did you know that there in First
[1:31:40] Corinthians, the Bible said, the Apostle
[1:31:42] Paul says that the sons of God will
[1:31:45] judge the angels.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's what he said there in 1
[1:31:49] Corinthians 6 and3. Sister Keith. Amen.
[1:31:52] Know ye not that ye shall judge angels?
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; So which is higher?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS HIGHER? A SON OF GOD OR an
[1:32:02] angel?
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:32:06] he's trying to bring this out
[1:32:09] because this man is the God of the
[1:32:13] angels. Th this one here is Amen. He's
[1:32:17] talked to us, God, who at sunundry times
[1:32:20] and diverse manners spake in the times
[1:32:22] past to the fathers by the prophets, but
[1:32:25] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:32:28] by his son, whom he hath appointed heir
[1:32:30] of all things, by whom also he made the
[1:32:34] worlds, who being the brightness of his
[1:32:37] glory, the express image of his person.
[1:32:42] Now, won't keep you too long here this
[1:32:45] morning. But my but my my thoughts I
[1:32:48] want to really establish this. So so
[1:32:51] he's he's looking here and as and as and
[1:32:53] as the apostle Paul is is is saying that
[1:32:56] what God is talking when he's looking at
[1:32:58] the sun and and and the preeminence that
[1:33:02] this son has had even before the angels.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; And um I don't have my I don't have I
[1:33:08] should have checked to see if I had my
[1:33:09] chalkboard here. I was just taking for
[1:33:11] granted I did.
[1:33:13] But the um
[1:33:17] brother brother Brandham and maybe
[1:33:20] you've I've we've seen the visuals a
[1:33:22] lot. Amen. But but brother Brandham
[1:33:25] would talk about that great fountain
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; that great that great invisible fountain
[1:33:32] of God within this wi within you you you
[1:33:35] look at a as a as an artisian well
[1:33:38] something that's coming up. It's it it
[1:33:41] it it it
[1:33:43] it's it's self-producing.
[1:33:46] So this great fountain of God, out of
[1:33:49] him is eternal righteousness. Out of him
[1:33:52] is eternal holiness and and and uh uh uh
[1:33:56] mercies and compassions and and and and
[1:34:00] it's and it's and it's AND IT'S ALL IN
[1:34:02] HIM. ALL OF THE ATTRIBUTES are have
[1:34:04] always been with God. They've been with
[1:34:06] God from all times. Amen. They they you
[1:34:11] Amen. He was God.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Those were the attributes. THOSE WERE
[1:34:16] THE ATTRIBUTES. GOD'S THOUGHTS. SO,
[1:34:18] BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD CALL IT AMEN. H a
[1:34:21] number one would be attri and fact keys
[1:34:24] if you can just make that up there like
[1:34:26] you do when you're when we're doing
[1:34:27] those girls and boys games. Just just
[1:34:29] put number one attributes and put it up
[1:34:31] there on the board. Hallelujah. Amen. If
[1:34:34] you can do that, you can't go. Okay.
[1:34:38] Amen. So the you you you you they they
[1:34:41] are the attributes of God. Amen. This is
[1:34:44] this is this is this is all God. But
[1:34:47] when God speaks
[1:34:49] out of God comes as as we've talked in
[1:34:52] the past the logos.
[1:34:55] This is this is amen that that that
[1:34:59] great fire. And this is where this is
[1:35:02] the very first light that God created.
[1:35:05] God didn't God God didn't create the son
[1:35:07] first. God created himself first. So
[1:35:10] when God this attributes all in him when
[1:35:13] God spoke out comes this logos. So
[1:35:16] number two amen is is is the word. It's
[1:35:21] the logos of God. So amen. It is with
[1:35:25] this theophony. This logos this
[1:35:27] theophony this is where he would appear
[1:35:30] in the pillar of fire. But he also
[1:35:33] appeared as a man. He appeared as a man
[1:35:35] to Moses and Moses seen the the the
[1:35:38] hinderer part of God and then he
[1:35:41] disappeared. Moses uh he appeared to he
[1:35:45] he he appeared in the fiery furnace.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was that was the word. That
[1:35:52] was the theophony of God.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could have he appeared in the
[1:35:57] uh uh he he the the Bible says that he
[1:36:00] appeared to Jacob and he wrestled all
[1:36:02] night long. Now, we say it's an angel,
[1:36:04] but he the Bible says that he called him
[1:36:07] God.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; He wrestled with God. God in a body.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; We we we see that when when he when when
[1:36:15] when Ezekiel saw him, he saw a man.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; When he appeared to Abraham, Amen. after
[1:36:24] a a after uh uh on on you know after the
[1:36:27] slaughter of the kings, it was a man who
[1:36:30] come and gave him uh uh uh fed him
[1:36:34] communion and and AND ABRAHAM PAID
[1:36:37] TITHES to him.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a man the later on uh in
[1:36:42] the 18TH CHAPTER THAT THAT A MAN come to
[1:36:46] to to Abraham and and and and he could
[1:36:50] recognize that that was God.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "You've come, you know, and he
[1:36:54] there God come and created his body."
[1:36:58] And then he had two angels come. But
[1:37:00] Abraham knew which one was God. Abraham
[1:37:03] knew which one was God.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and and he comes and he
[1:37:08] says, "Oh, you you've come from a" God
[1:37:10] says, "We've come from a far country."
[1:37:12] Yeah. Really far country. Amen. And uh
[1:37:15] uh and and so Abraham says, "I know who
[1:37:17] you are. Sit down, my Lord." Amen. I
[1:37:20] want to feed you. I want to give you to
[1:37:22] drink. He on. So So that was the
[1:37:25] theophony. And then when he was through
[1:37:27] talking to Abraham, he disappeared. That
[1:37:30] that's that's who he was. Amen. Now, and
[1:37:34] then so so that's the you know, some
[1:37:38] some people say, you know, they say
[1:37:39] there's two gods. There's two gods
[1:37:41] because there's there's there's there's
[1:37:43] the father and the son.
[1:37:46] And uh no, but it's all one God. And
[1:37:49] they say, 'Well, it has to be two gods
[1:37:51] because it says right right there in the
[1:37:53] Bible, "Let us create man in our own
[1:37:55] image." Well, first of all, by the time
[1:37:57] you got there, God was already living in
[1:38:00] a theophony.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; The invisible God was already living.
[1:38:06] He had a He was living in that pillar of
[1:38:09] fire.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every time that he appeared,
[1:38:12] he would appear him as a man. And we
[1:38:15] were created in the image Wow.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One God, one God, but
[1:38:22] it was God living. Can you say amen?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Now, brother, and and and so and then he
[1:38:29] was made flesh. So, we have number one,
[1:38:32] the attributes.
[1:38:34] Number two, the theophony, the word.
[1:38:38] Number three, God Christ was manifested
[1:38:42] in the flesh.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now we and and and and um and
[1:38:51] we we could we can look there even if
[1:38:53] you want to look there again in in
[1:38:54] Hebrews 7. Let's just look there at
[1:38:56] Hebrews 7 real quick. I I want I want to
[1:38:58] I want to I want to because I'm I'm
[1:39:00] trying I want to I want to see I want
[1:39:02] you to see yourself in this one. Don't
[1:39:05] you can't see yourself in an angel. You
[1:39:07] weren't an angel and you'll never be an
[1:39:09] angel.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And I don't guess any of us will ever be
[1:39:14] a word prophet. That's just not who we
[1:39:16] that's not who we're called to be. But
[1:39:19] we can identify oursel with this word,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; But we see Jesus. Now, I want y'all to
[1:39:25] see that as we go through through
[1:39:27] Hebrews because God's not wanting you to
[1:39:29] look at yourself as an angel. You'll
[1:39:31] never be one. Hallelujah. But let's see
[1:39:33] what Jesus is. Let's let's look there.
[1:39:36] He's uh there there in Hebrews 7 and1.
[1:39:40] Let's let's look at Jes at at Jesus. For
[1:39:43] this Melzdc, king of Salem, priest of
[1:39:46] the most high God, who met Abraham,
[1:39:49] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:39:51] kings, and blessed him. Now, now, now,
[1:39:53] now catch that. King of peace, priest of
[1:39:56] the most high God. Amen. To whom also
[1:40:00] Abraham gave a tenth part of all.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; First being interpretation, king of
[1:40:07] righteousness. After that also the king
[1:40:10] of Salem, which is the king of peace,
[1:40:13] without father, without mother, without
[1:40:17] descent, having neither beginning of
[1:40:20] days nor end of life, but made unto like
[1:40:26] unto the son of God abideth a priest
[1:40:30] continually. Well, who could this be? It
[1:40:33] was could not been Jesus the body. No,
[1:40:36] Jesus had a beginning. Jesus had an
[1:40:38] ending. IT WAS THE GREAT GOD,
[1:40:41] THE THEOPHONY OF GOD, IT STEPPING INTO A
[1:40:46] FLESH, REVEALING HIMSELF, COMING BACK,
[1:40:49] and then he became Jesus Christ.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus had the beginning, but Christ
[1:40:57] has been there, the logos, the theophony
[1:41:00] of God. I want you to catch that. GLORY
[1:41:02] TO GOD.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; NOW, WHAT DOES THIS DO for us? What does
[1:41:04] this do for us? Hallelujah. All right.
[1:41:08] SO, SO WE WE'VE GOT WE WE'VE GOT THE
[1:41:11] THEOPHONY of God. Hallelujah. I'm going
[1:41:14] to mark this here right now. Amen. We've
[1:41:17] got one. And it is that what what did I
[1:41:20] tell you? The first one is
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; attributes.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Attributes. That's right. Praise the
[1:41:25] Lord.
[1:41:29] Number two, word
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; the theophony.
[1:41:36] Amen.
[1:41:39] Hallelujah. Three.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Flesh
[1:41:46] attributes.
[1:41:48] Word.
[1:41:49] Flesh. Is that right?
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham tells us that we
[1:41:55] have three comingings too.
[1:41:57] Y'all know what it is? Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] Attributes.
[1:42:04] He said, "We came as flesh
[1:42:08] and then we're going to word." So here
[1:42:11] you've got the attributes, the thoughts
[1:42:13] of God. God spoke and then out of that,
[1:42:17] Amen. comes the image of God, the word
[1:42:22] image. Amen. That those that word image
[1:42:25] is what would appear to the prophets.
[1:42:28] Amen. It was that word image. It was the
[1:42:30] It was that it was that that that
[1:42:32] theophony
[1:42:34] and then it come Amen. Jesus that word
[1:42:39] entered into that body Jesus. And when
[1:42:42] we get to heaven, listen, that's there's
[1:42:44] only one there's only one you're going
[1:42:46] to ever see and that is the body of God,
[1:42:49] Jesus Christ.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; But now I want you to I want you to
[1:42:54] catch this. It's important that you
[1:42:56] identify not with not with tongues, not
[1:43:00] with prophecies, not with gifts, not
[1:43:03] with angels. It's important you identify
[1:43:07] with Christ the word.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Christ the word. It's so important. And
[1:43:12] and and I'm fixing to show you why here
[1:43:14] in a minute. Now,
[1:43:16] we were also attributes of God. We were
[1:43:19] in his thoughts, eternally in his
[1:43:21] thoughts. But we came, we skipped the
[1:43:24] word and we come in flesh. We were
[1:43:27] sinful.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus was word first. That's the reason
[1:43:32] why he could not sin. He could be
[1:43:35] tempted. HE COULD GO THROUGH THAT. BUT
[1:43:37] HE WAS word before flesh. You and I are
[1:43:40] flesh before word. So we were in sin.
[1:43:44] AND WE'VE GOT TO IDENTIFY WITH the
[1:43:48] bloody bleeding word that come to take
[1:43:53] our PLACE WHEN WE CAN IDENTIFY WITH THIS
[1:43:58] WITH THIS CHRIST WHO WAS THE WORD MADE
[1:44:01] FLESH WHO BLED FOR ALL OF GOD'S ELECTED.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN you be lost?
[1:44:08] H how can YOU BE LOST? BECAUSE YOU WERE
[1:44:12] YEAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:14] YOU WERE ATTRIBUTES AS HE WAS
[1:44:17] ATTRIBUTES. YOU WERE CHOSEN IN HIM
[1:44:21] BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; GOD KNEW YOU WERE COMING flesh before
[1:44:29] you were BECOMING WORD. GOD KNEW IT WAS
[1:44:31] GOING TO HAPPEN. GOD KNEW IT. SO GOD,
[1:44:35] YOU are represented in this one. So the
[1:44:38] apostle Paul is saying, "Listen, this
[1:44:40] ain't just angels and prophets and this
[1:44:42] is Christ. This is this is major. THIS
[1:44:47] IS GOD BECOMING FLESH." AND THEN HE
[1:44:50] WOULD begin to go through there and give
[1:44:51] all these attributes of God in this man.
[1:44:55] Reo as we just read it right now.
[1:44:59] So here we are attributes flesh born
[1:45:02] sin. But then God comes and sends the
[1:45:07] word. Now you've always were an
[1:45:09] attribute.
[1:45:11] But God would send his word and we would
[1:45:14] begin to eat on that word. Eat on that
[1:45:17] word. And as we're eating on that word,
[1:45:19] we're maturing. We're growing. We're
[1:45:22] we're coming into to uh uh the the image
[1:45:26] of what God wants. Now, do you do you
[1:45:29] realize when we talk about becoming the
[1:45:31] word, do do you understand what what the
[1:45:34] book of um uh uh 1 Corinthians first
[1:45:38] your 2 Corinthians 5 uh uh means when it
[1:45:41] says, "For we know if our earthly house,
[1:45:44] this flesh of this tabernacle were
[1:45:46] dissolved, we have one." Present tense,
[1:45:51] we have one waiting. Amen. We have a
[1:45:56] building, a house not made with hands,
[1:45:59] eternal in the heavens. Are are you
[1:46:02] hearing me? You see, he went attribute
[1:46:06] word theophony and then become flesh.
[1:46:09] You are attributes.
[1:46:12] You are flesh, but you're coming into
[1:46:17] the word.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE COME THERE'S THERE'S NOT A
[1:46:21] QUESTION ABOUT IT. YOUR THEOPHONY, YOUR
[1:46:24] WORD BODY IS already there.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Already.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHETS SAY YOUR
[1:46:33] THEOPHONY. WE hear from our theophony.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; When you're hearing from the word,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; right? He says when the preacher is
[1:46:42] preaching, you are hearing from your
[1:46:46] word. Theophony.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:46:52] now I I I was thinking about this last
[1:46:55] night and and and so I, you know, I just
[1:46:58] started looking up. Okay. So, animal
[1:47:01] life. So, it's all in the it's all in
[1:47:03] the DNA. It's all in the DNA. You eat.
[1:47:07] Amen. And as you eat according to your
[1:47:10] body type, then you just simply grow.
[1:47:13] You you it just your food your your food
[1:47:16] gets all Amen. you it goes in one mouth
[1:47:19] and it and goes through the esophagus
[1:47:22] and and then before you know it there's
[1:47:24] certain parts of that food goes for your
[1:47:26] brain, certain parts of that food goes
[1:47:27] for uh uh nutrition to this and that and
[1:47:30] the other and it just your your body
[1:47:31] just does it. Hallelujah. You don't eat
[1:47:33] this and say, "All right, I want this go
[1:47:35] to the brain and yes, I want this to go
[1:47:36] to my kidneys and I want this." You just
[1:47:38] eat, right? SO I I WAS I I WAS LOOKING
[1:47:42] AT THE I I WAS THINKING ABOUT the
[1:47:43] transition the the the going from the
[1:47:45] flesh to the word and I thought about
[1:47:47] the tadpole and the tadpole that the the
[1:47:50] tadpole is a uh um it it's it's it's one
[1:47:55] of what do you call those creatures that
[1:47:56] eat the leaves the plant the plant life
[1:47:59] or or
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; herbivore. Yes. So, so it it just eats
[1:48:03] the algae and and the things there on
[1:48:06] the but but after a while
[1:48:10] as the transition is fixing to get ready
[1:48:15] desire begins to change it cannot go
[1:48:18] through the transition without changing
[1:48:21] of diet.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; So what it does is it start it has to
[1:48:25] start eating protein. SO, IT GOES FROM
[1:48:27] EATING THE ALGAE to start eating protein
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; and finding the protein. And as it's
[1:48:35] EATING THE PROTEIN, THE TRANSITION IS
[1:48:38] BEGINNING to change. And it goes from a
[1:48:41] tedo to a frog.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; And and AND WE WENT THROUGH ALL OF THESE
[1:48:46] AGES, ALL OF THESE AGES, SEVEN AGES,
[1:48:51] and we've been eating a certain portion.
[1:48:53] But in the last days, God says, "I I've
[1:48:56] GOT TO CHANGE THE DIET IN ORDER TO MAKE
[1:48:58] THE TRANSITION."
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD CALLING THE WORD OUT OF
[1:49:02] YOU. SO WHAT DID GOD DO? GOD SENT US A
[1:49:07] MORE POSITIVE WORD. HE DIDN'T SEND US
[1:49:10] THE DARK SHADOWS OF DENOMINATIONALISM.
[1:49:13] WELL, THIS PREACHER SAID, THAT PREACHER
[1:49:14] SAID, "NO, IT WAS THE LOGOS HIMSELF. IT
[1:49:19] WAS THE PILLAR OF FIRE RETURNING BACK TO
[1:49:22] THIS DAY calling you calling that soul
[1:49:28] right back to him.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You're going to end up word.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, see this is and
[1:49:37] and and what are we doing? How do we do
[1:49:39] it, brother Wendle? I I I want to be
[1:49:41] there. Just eat and obey the word.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Eat and obey the word. Eat and obey the
[1:49:47] word. You've got to obey the word. Amen.
[1:49:49] That that's exactly right. And and so
[1:49:52] that that's the reason why Amen. Some of
[1:49:54] you I'm pressuring really hard to obey
[1:49:56] the word. If you're going to be a
[1:49:58] Christian, you better obey the word.
[1:50:00] Amen. Don't wait till tomorrow. Don't
[1:50:02] wait till next day. Get that word in
[1:50:04] your life now. Amen. We don't know when
[1:50:07] that rapture is coming.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; You got to get ready.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And I I I'm telling you, you you you YOU
[1:50:13] GOT TO GET RIGHT WITH THE WORD ONE WAY
[1:50:15] OR THE OTHER. be right with the word.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Or stay here and continue being a tadpo.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; But we don't want to be tadpoles.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just be
[1:50:30] a beast. That's all we are, folks. This
[1:50:32] flesh is nothing else but a beast. We
[1:50:35] are animal life. We're a mammal.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only thing that makes us
[1:50:41] different is there's that soul on the
[1:50:43] inside of us
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; that is calling us.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so we bypass that. But
[1:50:51] there's but there's a reason that God is
[1:50:54] is doing this. Amen. Brother Brandon
[1:50:57] would put it like this. He he would put
[1:50:59] it he he would put the like like the the
[1:51:02] diamond. He would say, "Now that diamond
[1:51:06] that diamond holds all the fire. It
[1:51:09] holds all the glory, but yet when you
[1:51:12] look into the diamond, it's murky. When
[1:51:15] you get a big diamond, it's murky. It's
[1:51:17] it's um Amen. It's uh uh uh it's got the
[1:51:21] characteristics. It's it's got the
[1:51:23] inherit inherent part. Amen. But but
[1:51:26] it's it's it's u you know uh um where
[1:51:31] dull, hazy, rough, uneven,
[1:51:35] jagged textures. And and so and that's
[1:51:38] the way God was. He's that he was that
[1:51:40] great diamond. Amen. He we knew God was
[1:51:43] merciful and just, but yet it was hazy
[1:51:45] in the Old Testament. But when Jesus
[1:51:47] came,
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He had all of those all of
[1:51:51] those things with were there. But it
[1:51:53] took that diamond being cut
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; and chipped and cut and then before you
[1:51:59] know it as it is cut, beat, mashed,
[1:52:02] Christ beat, mashed, just all of a
[1:52:05] sudden all of those eternal qualities of
[1:52:07] God begin to reflect. We've seen the
[1:52:10] mercy of God like never before. We saw
[1:52:12] election like never before. We saw uh
[1:52:15] predestination. We saw mercies and
[1:52:17] compassions like never before. We seen
[1:52:20] all of this like never before. When we
[1:52:23] seen
[1:52:24] GOD REFLECTED THROUGH a cut and bruised,
[1:52:29] he was bruised for our iniquity. The
[1:52:31] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:52:34] and with his stripes we are healed. Oh,
[1:52:37] can you say amen?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And only only Amen.
[1:52:42] the the the the cutter or the the the
[1:52:45] the the laper artist or whatever you
[1:52:47] call that guy's name. He can look at
[1:52:49] that that that that raw, hazy, jagged
[1:52:53] diamond. Amen. And he can see the
[1:52:56] intense quality before he ever cuts it.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; You came out of God just like Jesus did.
[1:53:02] You were the thoughts of God. You were
[1:53:04] eternal with God. And God sees all those
[1:53:09] qualities in you. Yes.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; And today he's cutting and chipping.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; So just as the great diamond Jesus
[1:53:19] Christ, we saw the reflection through
[1:53:21] him. There's also we're a diamond, too.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; And he's reflecting us. You're we're far
[1:53:28] superior than the angels. We're far
[1:53:30] superior than that than those kinds of
[1:53:33] things. The Bible says the least in the
[1:53:35] kingdom of God was greater than John the
[1:53:37] Baptist.
[1:53:39] Yes.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, SO WHAT IS THAT? WE'RE NOT
[1:53:45] TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH THE PROPHET. NO,
[1:53:47] NO, NO, NO. WE'RE not trying to do away
[1:53:48] with angels. No, no, no. THEY WERE. BUT
[1:53:51] WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS SEE yourself in
[1:53:54] the word.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so, so you you understand
[1:54:01] what I'm saying? Now I I want us before
[1:54:03] we be before we close here, let's go
[1:54:06] let's read just a a minute over here in
[1:54:08] the second chapter of Hebrews.
[1:54:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:16] Now, now if you go to the first verse,
[1:54:20] therefore we ought to give the more
[1:54:21] earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:54:24] heard, lest at any time we should let
[1:54:27] them slip. For if the word spoken by
[1:54:29] angels was steadfast, and every
[1:54:31] transgression and disobedience received
[1:54:34] a just recompense reward, how shall we
[1:54:37] escape if we neglect so great a
[1:54:39] salvation? So what would if the types
[1:54:41] and shadows was incredible? What are we
[1:54:45] going to do with this reality of Jesus
[1:54:49] Christ? Amen. And it says, "How shall
[1:54:51] come accept the great salvation which at
[1:54:52] the first began to be spoken by the Lord
[1:54:54] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[1:54:56] heard them?" And and God also bearing
[1:54:59] witness them witness with signs and
[1:55:02] wonders and with diverse miracles and
[1:55:04] gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[1:55:07] own will. Can you say amen?
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; For unto the angels hath he not put in
[1:55:12] subjection the world to come, whereof we
[1:55:16] speak. But one in a certain place
[1:55:19] testified saying, "What is mankind? Not
[1:55:24] necessarily man, but mankind, humanity.
[1:55:27] What is man that thou art mindful of
[1:55:31] him? Or the son of man that thou
[1:55:34] visitest him? Thou mst him a little
[1:55:38] lower than the angels." and and and the
[1:55:41] real and and the real uh uh words there.
[1:55:46] If I can if I can find that. Praise the
[1:55:48] Lord. I I had uh the the the other
[1:55:52] meaning to that here. Amen. Do you love
[1:55:55] him?
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um
[1:56:01] Oh, I hate that. I didn't I've got it
[1:56:03] here somewhere, but I can't find it.
[1:56:04] Anyways, Amen. In in in the original it
[1:56:07] says, "Thou mst him for a little while
[1:56:11] lower than the angels. Thou did crown
[1:56:15] him with glory and honor and did set him
[1:56:17] over the works of thine hands, and thou
[1:56:20] has put all things in subjection under
[1:56:22] him. For in that he put all things under
[1:56:25] him, he left nothing that is not put
[1:56:27] under him. But now for a while we see
[1:56:31] not yet all things put under him. But we
[1:56:35] see Jesus. Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Who was made for a little while lower
[1:56:43] than the angels for the suffering of
[1:56:45] death. Crowned with glory and honor that
[1:56:49] he by the grace of God should taste
[1:56:54] death for every man. So here we are for
[1:56:59] a little while.
[1:57:02] We're in this
[1:57:05] and YET AND THEN CHRIST for a little
[1:57:08] while took on sinful flesh. He didn't
[1:57:12] sin. He was left with and yet he paid
[1:57:15] the price for me and you and he went
[1:57:17] back. What what am I trying to say for
[1:57:20] this little while that we here? It's not
[1:57:23] going to last too much longer.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; We're going back. We're going. We see
[1:57:27] Jesus. Angels couldn't do it. Prophets
[1:57:29] couldn't do this, but Jesus could.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:57:37] that great logos came after us.
[1:57:40] Hallelujah. Well, isn't that just
[1:57:42] wonderful,
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; man? That's wonderful. Amen. AND AND THE
[1:57:46] ANGELS, GOD STILL HAS ANGELS TODAY.
[1:57:49] AMEN. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ATTAIN ANGELS.
[1:57:52] NO, WE HAVE BEEN RESTORED ALREADY. Not
[1:57:55] maybe not in our PHYSICAL CONDITION, BUT
[1:57:57] OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS ALREADY been
[1:57:59] restored back to God. Brother Brandon
[1:58:01] would say, "Which one's higher? A son of
[1:58:03] God or an angel?"
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; He says, "A son of God." SON OF GOD.
[1:58:08] WHY? YOU WERE IN THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD.
[1:58:10] YOU WERE IN THE THOUGHTS OF GOD. YOU ARE
[1:58:13] YOU WERE WITH HIM. YES. You skipped the
[1:58:16] word.
[1:58:17] Amen. And you were born in this sinful
[1:58:19] body.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; But it didn't change the attributes
[1:58:23] inside you. And we are going back.
[1:58:26] Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord. If
[1:58:28] the musicians will come
[1:58:33] amen
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; in the form of God.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:43] Amen. Yes. Yes. The great redeemer.
[1:58:48] Amen. Become my savior.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He for a little while.
[1:58:56] Hallelujah. Took on sinful flesh.
[1:59:01] But it wasn't. But you put it, you look
[1:59:03] at both. You look at that translation
[1:59:04] and it's in both of them. It's for both.
[1:59:06] Amen. You for a little whileed
[1:59:11] 70 years.
[1:59:13] Amen. You're allotted. But oh, the
[1:59:15] promise is the word.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; You're the promise is the word. So what
[1:59:20] are we doing? We're eating that word.
[1:59:21] Don't tell me you're eating the word if
[1:59:22] you're not living that word.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you're eating the word if
[1:59:25] if if it's if it it becomes your desire.
[1:59:28] You you just you're not making yourself
[1:59:30] do anything. You're just eating the
[1:59:32] word. That's what you that's your
[1:59:34] genetics. That's what you're craving.
[1:59:36] That's what you want. Amen. And that's
[1:59:38] the reason why we just Satan wants to
[1:59:41] pull us this way and that way and and
[1:59:43] and and and get our appetite away from
[1:59:47] those things. And that's why there's
[1:59:48] where we have to fight. There's where we
[1:59:51] have to fight is to watch those
[1:59:52] appetites that Satan's trying to pull us
[1:59:54] this way or that way. Amen. What is that
[1:59:56] soul craving? What's that soul craving?
[1:59:59] Well, praise the Lord. When a when a
[2:00:02] mama's given birth, all of a sudden
[2:00:04] there's just man, she just gets these
[2:00:06] wild cravings. There's something in
[2:00:09] there's a life on the inside of her that
[2:00:11] is that is craving for something. Amen.
[2:00:14] I you know, as I as I told you, uh my my
[2:00:17] grandmother, my mom's mother, you know,
[2:00:19] she get got pregnant and and she wanted
[2:00:22] she wanted them to go out and dig up
[2:00:24] some clean dirt. Amen. Clean dirt. I
[2:00:29] thought dirt was dirty, but they she she
[2:00:31] wanted clean dirt. So, they'd have to
[2:00:32] get it way down to get some clean dirt
[2:00:34] and she would eat. Now that
[2:00:38] but there was something in that dirt
[2:00:42] that that baby was calling for.
[2:00:45] That baby was calling for it. Praise the
[2:00:49] Lord. The boy eating the eating eating
[2:00:53] the pedals off the bicycles.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; His system WAS CALLING for sulfur.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what it was. They would
[2:01:03] just come outside. They thought they
[2:01:05] thought they were raising a weirdo.
[2:01:06] They'd come around and there's the boy.
[2:01:08] Instead of riding the bike, he was
[2:01:09] eating the pedals.
[2:01:13] Hallelujah. Finally took him in to see
[2:01:15] what was going on. And the doctor says
[2:01:18] he's lacking sulfur. His system is
[2:01:22] craving sulfur.
[2:01:24] And when he's when they started giving
[2:01:26] him that,
[2:01:28] he quit eating the pedals off the bikes.
[2:01:31] AND AS SONS OF GOD, WE WE GOT A CRAVING
[2:01:34] AND AND WE'RE TRYING TO SATISFY IT WITH
[2:01:36] THIS. We're trying to satisfy it with
[2:01:39] that.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] You see,
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I I I don't know. Why?
[2:01:46] Why? Why give room for the devil? We
[2:01:49] know it doesn't satisfy.
[2:01:51] It doesn't. So get rid of those things
[2:01:54] that would so easily beset us. Say,
[2:01:56] "Lord, you're the creator of this. Your
[2:01:59] I was in your thoughts. You You're
[2:02:01] eternal. You're you're big. I You know
[2:02:04] what I'm needing?
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And he sends us his word. And he knows
[2:02:09] how to feed. And what we do is we just
[2:02:12] eat it. We just eat it. We can't eat
[2:02:15] Luther's. That was that was on the
[2:02:18] herbivore. That was under that
[2:02:21] deal. But here we are. We're Amen. We're
[2:02:25] a carnivore.
[2:02:27] We're eating the meat. Amen.
[2:02:30] Amen. It's God that's taking us up
[2:02:35] higher. We don't understand it. We're
[2:02:38] not being religious about it. It's just
[2:02:41] our craving.
[2:02:43] So, if you can live in sin and stay in
[2:02:44] sin, then that means that maybe there
[2:02:46] ain't a there ain't there there ain't
[2:02:48] maybe maybe maybe you don't maybe maybe
[2:02:50] maybe maybe they don't have a
[2:02:53] maybe they don't have a word body that's
[2:02:55] that that's calling.
[2:02:59] But a Christian
[2:03:02] who was in his thoughts before, God
[2:03:03] sends his word and says we'll live by
[2:03:05] his word. Man shall live by every word
[2:03:08] of God.
[2:03:12] All that is is Lord, just keep me in
[2:03:13] your will.
[2:03:15] Keep me in your will.
[2:03:17] Keep me in your will.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; If I'm wrong, I want to get it right
[2:03:20] now. Not tomorrow. Not I yesterday. I
[2:03:23] got to get it wrong. I got to get it
[2:03:24] right. I'm not going to live in sin.
[2:03:27] not going to do it.
[2:03:30] Well, but but she done this to me and he
[2:03:32] done that. I don't care. Get it fixed.
[2:03:36] Well, I you know,
[2:03:39] I I just I I just No, no, no. Just it's
[2:03:43] there's a craving in our heart. We know
[2:03:47] we don't fit in. WE KNOW SOMETHING'S WE
[2:03:49] WE KNOW. WE JUST know it's it's we would
[2:03:52] listen. It don't take rocket scientists
[2:03:54] to tell us that there's SOMETHING
[2:03:56] MISSING in us.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; YES,
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT THIS is
[2:04:02] I don't want to live in this body the
[2:04:04] rest of my LIFE. I CAN'T. THERE'S
[2:04:06] something missing in me.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; But there's a craving.
[2:04:12] So what we do is we know where that
[2:04:14] craving's coming from. It's why the
[2:04:16] world can't satisfy it. Sex can't
[2:04:17] satisfy it. Education can't satisfy it.
[2:04:21] uh a jobs can't satisfy it. Nothing can
[2:04:23] satisfy it. It's God. And God has come
[2:04:27] to us in this day with a message. And
[2:04:31] that message hits the spot.
[2:04:34] Let's live by it.
[2:04:37] Is that right?
[2:04:39] Am I Am I making sense? It's not a
[2:04:41] religious cycle.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; It's just fellowship with the word.
[2:04:46] It's just simply he gives me his word
[2:04:48] and I say, "Okay,
[2:04:51] I'm going to live by that."
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; He gives, "Okay,
[2:04:56] yes, my Lord, that's your desire. Your
[2:04:58] desire is my command." That settles it.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; See? Hallelujah. Do you love him?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you going to fail? You
[2:05:08] going to fall? Okay. Well, there's
[2:05:09] plenty of blood for when you do fall.
[2:05:11] We're going to fall. We're still living
[2:05:12] in this herbivore body.
[2:05:19] But there is that there is a reality
[2:05:22] that is saying, "Amen. Come on. Come on
[2:05:25] up higher."
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; I can hear my theophony calling me.
[2:05:39] Some Some say, you know, I was thinking
[2:05:41] about Halen and her birthday today, you
[2:05:43] know.
[2:05:45] and and Heavy
[2:05:47] Haven
[2:05:49] is she's just as cute as as cute can be,
[2:05:53] you know, and I love my Haven.
[2:05:59] And some some say, well,
[2:06:04] you know, won't be much difference
[2:06:06] between heaven and and here. I mean,
[2:06:08] I'm, you know, well, I guess I'll be 18
[2:06:11] there. And uh
[2:06:15] we'll be young, you guys. You know, like
[2:06:17] you know, all of you good-looking punks,
[2:06:21] but can you imagine being there with
[2:06:24] with no turmoil? No turmoil, no
[2:06:29] none of that.
[2:06:35] There'll be no turmoil as as a young as
[2:06:37] as young people. And that that's what
[2:06:39] the crazy thing is a lot what I found in
[2:06:41] a lot in in among the young people today
[2:06:44] is there is there seems to be more
[2:06:46] turmoil in our generation in in in our
[2:06:48] youth. I mean I had turmoil when I was a
[2:06:50] kid but but I know there's there there's
[2:06:53] a lot of that turmoil. Can you imagine?
[2:06:55] You've got a body on the other side
[2:06:58] with with all beauty and no turmoil,
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; no fear,
[2:07:06] no mistakes,
[2:07:09] no wondering if we're cute or not cute,
[2:07:12] no wondering if this one likes us or
[2:07:14] that one doesn't. No wandering.
[2:07:19] If there's any hope,
[2:07:27] that's the one we're going to, folks.
[2:07:31] We see Jesus.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; We see Jesus.
[2:07:38] And that Jesus is among us great, great,
[2:07:41] great, great with his word today. Did I
[2:07:44] make sense today? Did Did my thoughts
[2:07:45] here I I
[2:07:52] the Apostle Paul,
[2:07:54] he found this Jehovah to be Jesus and he
[2:07:58] and he's looking and he's and it made
[2:08:00] the difference in his life.
[2:08:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:11] Well, praise the Lord.
[2:08:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; What are you What are you playing there,
[2:08:18] brother Kobe?
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Game
[2:08:29] for Jesus.
[2:08:34] I have
[2:08:37] longing
[2:08:39] in my heart.
[2:08:47] Amen. Amen.
[2:08:55] Just to be near him,
[2:08:58] to feel
[2:09:00] his
[2:09:02] presence.
[2:09:06] I had
[2:09:08] a longing
[2:09:11] in my heart
[2:09:14] for
[2:09:17] him.
[2:09:21] I have a longing
[2:09:29] longing
[2:09:32] for Jesus.
[2:09:49] Every one of us have it.
[2:09:52] The preacher didn't give it to you.
[2:09:55] Connor, your mom and dad didn't give it
[2:09:57] to you.
[2:10:00] And it's not based on them. And it's not
[2:10:02] based on the preacher. It's based on
[2:10:03] that election way before the foundation
[2:10:06] of the world.
[2:10:12] You were born, Jesse, in a sinful home.
[2:10:16] But it wasn't it wasn't that. It was
[2:10:19] predestination.
[2:10:22] It don't matter. It don't it don't
[2:10:24] matter whether we come from a Christian
[2:10:25] home or not. There's a longing in us.
[2:10:29] And we fight. We fight with ourselves.
[2:10:31] We fight in our minds. We
[2:10:40] But we have that word body waiting on
[2:10:44] us.
[2:10:46] That's what we're striving for.
[2:10:50] We're striving for that.
[2:10:53] And God brings us in those areas.
[2:10:56] He took you out of out of a a sinner's
[2:11:00] home and brought you Why?
[2:11:04] because he knew that it was going to be
[2:11:06] dependent on
[2:11:09] that body was going to be dependent on
[2:11:11] what you're eating on here.
[2:11:15] That's why
[2:11:19] it grieves me to see believers homes
[2:11:21] with TVs in their houses.
[2:11:24] It does. It It just grieves me. Grieves
[2:11:28] me to see preachers doing it. I I just
[2:11:36] but ultimately
[2:11:40] the seed is going to reflect it's going
[2:11:42] to reflect this message.
[2:11:49] I
[2:11:52] I think the longing in our heart
[2:11:57] should be
[2:11:59] if I'm a seed of Abraham,
[2:12:02] then I'm going to bring as many people
[2:12:04] and feed with me on that right those
[2:12:07] righteous things.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:13] I I I'm not I I don't want I don't want
[2:12:15] to take the younger generation or even
[2:12:18] my friends and
[2:12:20] get them all muddled up here.
[2:12:24] I I I want to cut loose of these things
[2:12:27] here
[2:12:30] because there's got to be something.
[2:12:33] There's got to be something.
[2:12:38] And I know,
[2:12:40] you know,
[2:12:42] I'm known around here as as as as the
[2:12:45] fuddy duddy on all the electronics and
[2:12:47] the I am absolutely against the gaming
[2:12:50] uh over the internet. I'm just against
[2:12:52] it.
[2:12:56] You elders that do it with our young
[2:12:57] people, I just feel like you're teaching
[2:13:00] them to put more time on their phone.
[2:13:02] you're I just I just
[2:13:09] I'm just against it.
[2:13:11] But it don't matter how much I preach
[2:13:12] it. It's you're going to do it anyway.
[2:13:19] And here's the deal.
[2:13:25] Why can't we use our influence in a in
[2:13:27] in a positive way
[2:13:30] for these kids?
[2:13:33] Why why why why why can't we if we if we
[2:13:35] want to be together and do things let's
[2:13:37] let's um do message quizzes with one
[2:13:41] another or do what you know I don't know
[2:13:48] I'm saying that Satan knows
[2:13:54] Satan knows that we can only eat a
[2:13:56] certain kind of stuff
[2:14:00] and that We're living in a in a twofold
[2:14:04] body,
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; And while we do have to have games, and
[2:14:08] while we do have to, we do I understand
[2:14:10] that.
[2:14:12] I think it's good to have board games,
[2:14:14] family time. I I I do.
[2:14:22] But I do believe the internet's taken
[2:14:24] away from the family time. And I I do I
[2:14:26] do believe that one person being in a
[2:14:28] bedroom with a phone, another person's
[2:14:30] bedroom with a phone taken away from
[2:14:33] families. It's taken away from prayer.
[2:14:36] Was taken away from these kinds of
[2:14:37] things. Listen, I don't game on my
[2:14:41] stupid phone.
[2:14:43] And I have a problem putting my phone
[2:14:46] down. Okay?
[2:14:54] I just say there's
[2:14:57] you got a you got a theophony body
[2:14:59] that's calling you
[2:15:03] and that theophony body ain't a game.
[2:15:08] Brother Brandham says it's the word
[2:15:09] calling the word. It's the word calling
[2:15:11] that out of our souls.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand where where I'm at on
[2:15:18] it? I'm not dogmatic.
[2:15:21] I don't know. I I you know
[2:15:25] hey
[2:15:27] I sat down and and watched it's a
[2:15:29] wonderful life
[2:15:32] might blow you away but I do I have
[2:15:37] I'm not I'm not dogmatic
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; I'm saying
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; there there there there's
[2:15:51] There's a cry
[2:15:54] in all of us. And that the cries,
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; we got to feed that. Got to feed it.
[2:15:59] Just keep on eating.
[2:16:02] Someone had asked me, "Well, brother,
[2:16:03] what can I do? I I I know I want I want
[2:16:05] to go to heaven. What can I do?" I said,
[2:16:06] "Just eat. Just eat.
[2:16:10] That's all you have to do. Just eat the
[2:16:12] word. Just eat." It does the changing
[2:16:16] itself. We are being transformed, but
[2:16:19] we've got to eat it.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; I want the supernatural. Just keep on
[2:16:25] eating.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Keep on feeding. Just feed. Feed that
[2:16:29] inner man. Feed that inner man. I
[2:16:32] promise you this. We'll see
[2:16:33] supernatural.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; We'll see devils cast out. We'll see
[2:16:37] miracles and healings. We'll see all of
[2:16:39] that.
[2:16:41] But I think I think our part is just
[2:16:44] just taking his word, loving it, eating
[2:16:47] it. That's all. Don't be anything else.
[2:16:50] Brother Brand says, "Don't try to be
[2:16:51] anything. Don't be don't try to be
[2:16:52] different." Opening of the seals, he
[2:16:54] said, "Don't try to make yourself any
[2:16:55] different. Just just be a Christian and
[2:16:59] just eat."
[2:17:04] As you can tell, I don't have a problem
[2:17:06] eating
[2:17:08] sometimes.
[2:17:10] God's not wanting us to feed this. He
[2:17:12] wants us to feed that soul.
[2:17:16] Oh God,
[2:17:19] I don't think I'm an old fogy. I just
[2:17:21] don't think I don't think because I've
[2:17:23] got my convictions from this message.
[2:17:26] What I say about TVs, Brother Brandham
[2:17:28] says the exact same thing except even
[2:17:30] worse.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; What I've said about those spirits,
[2:17:34] Brother Brandham has said it and even
[2:17:35] worse. I cannot say it as hard as
[2:17:37] brother Bradamus said it.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; It's there.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; But are we eating?
[2:17:47] Religion is going to be here when we're
[2:17:50] gone.
[2:17:52] But the word eating bride is going to be
[2:17:55] transformed.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Into that image.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; And buddy, I'm believing we're fixing to
[2:18:02] step into it.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:18:07] But brother Windle, I just I can't
[2:18:08] everybody make the rapture because I've
[2:18:09] got all my faults and I've got Eat. Just
[2:18:12] eat.
[2:18:14] You're going to make it.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; But we can tell when we're not eating
[2:18:19] the way we should be eating because then
[2:18:21] there's Hallelujah. We got the cupcakes
[2:18:24] and the then when you sit down at the
[2:18:26] meal, mama knows you've been eating
[2:18:28] something else besides
[2:18:30] Amen. waiting for for the dinner. Amen.
[2:18:34] So we want to there's a table spread
[2:18:37] where the saints of God are fed. He
[2:18:40] invites his chosen people
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; to come and dine.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. All right.
[2:18:51] So I told you I was going to quit at 12
[2:18:54] and it's probably 1. Amen. Let's stand
[2:18:56] to our feet. God bless you.
[2:19:00] There's a calling.
[2:19:03] Calling
[2:19:06] for Jesus.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Put that song back up there, y'all. I
[2:19:12] have a longing
[2:19:16] in my heart
[2:19:19] for
[2:19:21] him.
[2:19:26] Just to
[2:19:29] be near him.
[2:19:33] to feel
[2:19:36] his presence.
[2:19:39] That's all I want.
