Praise the name of the Lord. He's so wonderful, isn't he? Just his presence is just so sweet right now. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. If you have your Bibles, we'll look here in Luke the first chapter and the 31st verse. We are thankful to God. Brother Torrance, it's good to see you tonight. bless you. Been missing brother Torrance and um uh we sure do appreciate him. We want to look here at Luke 1 and 31 and it says, "Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus." 34th verse. Then Mary said unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing that I know no not a man?" The 37th verse, for with God nothing is impossible. And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word." And the angel departed. Amen. We ask God's blessings upon his word. You can be seated here this evening. sort of going to finish up my thoughts as we have been thinking about last Sunday. The word was made flesh. The word was made flesh. It was great God Almighty. It was nothing none other than God himself. This morning we talked about that there was a portion of God that was left behind when Jesus raised from the dead. We understand the fullness of God's spirit was in him and it was male and female. When he left Amen he left that feminist part of him here on the earth. Amen. That's his spirit. And he's embodied a bride. And there in the book of Acts, we could see the many blessings that have come from that. And tonight, I'd like to just sort of finish up my thoughts if if I may. Amen. Being fruitful. We can God's God's design is to is for us to be fruitful &gt;&gt; and amen. So we can look at this child. We can ask we can answer the question, who is this mysterious child? He is the word made flesh. He it was God in a body that had so taken over this body. But yet Jesus would say, "My meat is to do the will of him. My father lives in me. He does the works." And then when we look here, as I say this morning, who is this mysterious woman? Amen. She is bone of his bone. She is flesh of his flesh. And the works of her husband is made manifest through her. and God and and and in the in the Bible days, Amen. the the woman always looked to the to the Lord to bless the fruit of her womb. And when a lady couldn't have children, amen, she felt that she had that God had closed up her womb, that she was not able to produce. And and it was considered a curse. It was a curse when a woman couldn't couldn't um have children &gt;&gt; because children were man it it it um it was it was the connection between two people becoming one &gt;&gt; and amen and so it would be the the legacy of the man going forward. So the fruit of the womb was very important to the woman and we understand we could see that in in Rachel and Leah. Rachel uh of course you know Jacob had had worked seven years uh for for for um Rachel and and then um um then he was deceived and had to work he got he got Leah. And so then he worked for another seven years for Laban and and and then and and then he was then he married he was given uh uh Rachel &gt;&gt; and um Leah could produce. Leah Leah was able to have children but Rachel was not able to have children. &gt;&gt; And and so it was it was a it was a continual struggle. There's a continual battle. Amen. between the two because one wanted to and then but then uh one could have it and one could not, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And through the agony and prayer, then God opened the womb of of Rachel. &gt;&gt; And and and Rachel uh gave Joseph or or gave Jacob a Joseph, &gt;&gt; gave Jacob a Benjamin. And and it was it was a sacred thing for God. It was a sacred thing for for them all. And it was a but it was so it being fruitful, being being able to produce is is is what God is want. So we could go we're not going to go through uh anything just real deep tonight. I've just got a few quotes I want to give you. But amen when we when we when brother Brandham would talk about Amen. the fruit and he would or he talk about the the the uh uh the bedding grounds and &gt;&gt; Amen. And it it it was an important it was an important thing. Amen. It the fruitfulness of a woman was very important to the Jewish people and still is. And um so when Jesus would would tell his he would look at his disciples and he says as he's fixing to leave and he says you've not chosen me but I have chosen you and I've ordained you to go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit would remain. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he would he would say we're entering into a a different level. I'm not looking at you and talking to you as as as uh uh uh as servants, he said, but I'm talking to you on a higher level. Amen. And so it is today. God is talking to us on a higher level. He's talking to us as his bride. And and so as we as we uh uh look through some of these things here tonight, I I think that we should our thinking should be on a higher level. &gt;&gt; Not not a not a girl, a schoolgirl level, but a but a matured bride level &gt;&gt; because God wants fruit. &gt;&gt; God wants Amen. a a a continuation of himself. Amen. And so and and as I say, when God would pronounce blessings o upon upon the different ones, he he would pronounce he would always go to the fruit of the womb. And I I want God to do that. I want God to look upon every one of you here tonight and say, "I will bless your womb." Not not not that we're thankful for our natural children, but I'm asking God to bless your spiritual children. &gt;&gt; I I I I want to bring forth spiritual fruit unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Psalms 128 and3, thy wife shall be fruit, a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house, and thy children like olive plants round about thy table. So when we when we look here at this mysterious woman, she's not necessarily she doesn't necessarily have a lot of flash to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. This woman that we talked about this morning, there's not just a whole lot of Amen. uh uh in our daytoday you you might not it's not going to be the big churches not going to have a lot of a lot of shows and a lot of things that that would go on. But this is a woman that understands that she is part of him in every way. She understands that she as she's just as much a mystery as he is a mystery. He is God in a body and she understands that she is God in a body. &gt;&gt; She's just the feminine part of God. Amen. And God's got a work here on the earth. And and so she she understands that she is the only one that can give birth to the word because God is not going to place his word in a harlot. HE'S NOT GOING TO PLACE HIS WORD OUT there on these floozies, these denominational &gt;&gt; flooies. &gt;&gt; He's only going to place his word in his bride. &gt;&gt; And she knows that. &gt;&gt; She understands that. Amen. She was eating before the foundation of the world. And and and and it will be through her and her alone that his word can be birthed through. So, SO THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE THING TO her because she understands not only that he is God, BUT SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT she is his bride. And it and it makes it gives a it it GIVES A A A responsibility really begins to settle down upon her &gt;&gt; that I am the one that will that will bring forth children. &gt;&gt; I am the one that is going to do this and it'll all be supernatural. So, brother Brandham, in this e in the god of this evil age, if you haven't listened to the god of this evil age in a while, that's a that that's a powerful message because while there's a lot of uh condemnation uh of the system and the harlot, he is also really really ministering to the bride. And in any of these messages that you listen to, but you you you've got to understand they're they're he's condemning the harlot, the denominational systems. Amen. For what they have done and the blessings that God's given them. And they've turned it out. They've spurned it. Amen. And taken on other seed, denominational seed, man-made ideas, dogmas. Mama said, daddy said, the pope said, the preacher said, AMEN. BUT THEN HE ALSO COMES TO THE BRIDE, HIS BRIDE, and he says, "Listen, there's something precious about you, and I want you to always pick that up in any of those messages that you that you're listening to. Always pick that up." Amen. Some people say, "Well, he's he's condemning me. It's just nothing but condemnation." And I listen to the same message and say, "I hear I hear nothing but but affirmation. I hear nothing but Amen. celebration. something telling me, "Listen, Amen. you you mean a lot to me." And and so in in the uh God of this evil age, he would say, "But in obedience," Amen. Now, he's just he just left him. He was pretty upset. God's God's God's uh uh uh pronounced judgment on the flooies. But now he's saying in obedience, this little faith woman lives by faith. the bride, the p this the person here and there and here and off somewhere else, some other church. Amen. Whatever it is, some see believes the word of God and is obedient and she's waiting in love FOR THE PROMISE OF THE age to be confirmed. Now, SHE'S HE'S GOT THIS HE'S GOT THIS BRIDE, THIS LITTLE FAITH WOMAN THAT IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW JUST anything into the womb of her heart. Amen. He says she believes the word and obedient, waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed. She's watching for it. She's part of that word. She's watching for her life to manifest that word. Brethren, can't you see it? I hope that don't go over you. AMEN. THE BODY IS WAITING. THE BODY IS WAITING FOR which is the word. WAITING FOR THE LIFE WHICH is the spirit to confirm and make it alive. Now I I want you TO I WANT TO STOP THERE REAL QUICK BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. YOU ARE PART bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, word of his word. AMEN. THAT WORD YOU'RE A PART OF HIM. So that new creation in you, amen, IS IS THE WORD. YOU ARE A WORD BEING. &gt;&gt; So he's saying she is THE WORD. THIS BODY IS waiting for the spirit, the Holy Spirit, the life, THE GERM TO COME down to confirm and make IT ALIVE. THAT'S WHAT SHE'S WAITING FOR. No other life will work in her. She can't come to life any other way. YET SHE FEELS IT OUT THERE. SHE KNOWS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AMEN. And there it happens when then she wakes up and she says let and when God says let there be and then she came forth uh like the first one that would come forth. And what is WHAT WHAT WHAT HE'S saying is the word that IS SPOKEN BRINGS ABOUT ANOTHER CREATION. And that's what we are are wanting. But God is speaking that creation through us. &gt;&gt; We're giving birth to his word. We're giving birth to the supernatural. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE BEDDING GROUNDS. THE WOMB MUST BE pure and undefiled because we want to be fruitful. in the invisible union. HE SAID HER BODY IS GIVEN TO HER A SACRED TRUST from God. No female dog, no bird, no other animal, no other creature like that. NO, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE TALKING ABOUT the woman. AND THAT'S WHY THAT'S THE REASON it's so sacred. She is to bring forth life into the earth. HER BODY IS THE BEDDING grounds of life. Therefore, that's the reason she is given this sacred trust. &gt;&gt; The woman is given that. Amen. Now, he was saying it's not like any other kind of animal life. They don't have souls. So, they can't commit adultery. &gt;&gt; Amen. A dog can't commit adultery. Uh the animal LIFE CAN'T COMMIT ADULTERY. BUT A WOMAN IS GIVEN THAT THAT SACREDNESS because she is producing. Amen. uh she's bringing INTO THE WORLD THAT THAT which God had created in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The these men, these boys, girls have a SOUL AND THAT SOUL IS IMPORTANT. AND SHE MUST NOT DEFILE her womb. SHE MUST NOT THAT'S THE SACRED BEDDING GROUND between her and her husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the reason I say Amen. there that you you you you men fight that spirit that that would have you looking at other women. God's given you a woman and there's only one woman for you. And that woman should know that you that that she is your everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. Should know. Boys, you should always do that. THIS IS A SACRED SACRED THING. AND I PROMISE YOU, the commitment that God is asking of you, he's also keeping that for himself. GOD'S NOT FOLLOWING the flooies out there and commit adultery against his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He's going to bring it through his bride or it won't happen. &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it through his bride or it won't happen. Can you say amen? And so, Amen. He He So, it's a sacred thing. and and and in the power of transformation. And he's preaching this a lot of these he's he's preaching uh I'm quoting out a lot of these just before brother Brandham passes away and he's and he's and he's really driving these things home and and the power of transformation and this is 103165. Amen. HE SAYS WE ALSO FIND OUT THAT when he come in uh he deformed that seed. He corrupted that seed by getting into the bedding grounds which was Eve. So, so Satan come in, Amen. and polluted the bedding grounds. And now Eve produced a wild man. Now through adultery, she produced something that she wasn't created to produce. &gt;&gt; She was CREATED TO PRODUCE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; ADAM WAS TO SPEAK that word. She was to connect seed. Amen. H was to to to receive seed and to PRODUCE THE SEED. THAT'S WHAT THE WOMAN WAS FOR. To to reproduce the man. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE BRIDE IS FOR. To reproduce her lover, HER CHRIST, THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's the reason why. Amen. That's the reason why when God TALKED TO THE OTHER WOMAN uh uh uh there in the in the church, there's three women uh in there in the book of Revelation. There is the the wise virgin, there's the foolish virgin, and then there is the adulterous woman. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE THE WISE virgin is is is going to receive seed. THE FOOLISH VIRGIN IS NOT GOING TO RECEIVE SEED. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IT THE LIFE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO HER. Are you HEARING ME? THE WISE VIRGIN IS SAY, "I WANT TO receive your seed into my womb because I want to produce," Amen. your your desires here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. So he says he corrupted that seed uh by getting into the bedding grounds which was Eve and corrupted it and and corrupted the seed with a corruptible seed before it gets there. uh be before it it could get there Adam seed to corrupt the beautiful garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But then on on down in in the the power of transformation, he says, "But that seed will take a hold somewhere." Glory to God. The only thing he's looking for today is a bedding ground somewhere that it can bed. How how many wants to just say, "Lord, be it unto me. Be it unto me according to thy word." I I I I don't want that. I I I DON'T WANT TO I I DON'T WANT THAT TO THE THE the the spirit of the Lord to move over Mary and go to somebody else because Mary is is is doesn't have enough faith to believe that God can USE HER. BUT GOD, SHE SAYS, "HOW CAN IT BE?" AND GOD LOOKS AT HER AND SAYS, "ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITH GOD." &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT'S GOING TO OVERSHADOW YOU. THE LIFE, IT'S NOT IN YOU, MARY. YOU DON'T PRODUCE IT. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THE bed ground. &gt;&gt; You got to give the bedding ground. Amen. If there's no bedding ground, then you can't produce fruit. &gt;&gt; You can't produce the fruit. Can I Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; God wants the fruit OF YOUR WOMB. GOD WANTS A SACRED BEDDING ground for his word. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. I I I I love that. Yeah. I I love that a lot to be honest. Amen. Amen. You You You don't understand how this how is this body CHANGE GOING TO TAKE PLACE? You're just eating the word. &gt;&gt; You're just eating and eating and feasting on the word. Amen. And you don't really even realize it, but you're changing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HOW DID YOU grow when YOU WAS A WHEN YOU WAS A BOY OR A GIRL? You just kept on feeding. Amen. Mama kept feeding and you kept on eating. Hallelujah. And and and and and there was something in you that that was making you stronger and stronger. Well, that's what Abraham done. How did Abraham go from an OLD MAN TO A YOUNG MAN? He just kept eating the promises of God. &gt;&gt; He couldn't do anything else. HE JUST SIMPLY ACCEPTED THE WORD OF GOD. BE IT UNTO BE. AND HE JUST ate and he ate and he ate and he ate until one day he wakes up and Sarah's over there just a young lady. He's a young man again. Amen. What What is it there? There he he was eating and his his food was becoming strength. &gt;&gt; HIS FOOD WAS BECOMING WELL. PRAISE the name of the Lord. Do do you just love him here tonight? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU GOT TO KEEP ON EATING. AMEN. And and BROTHER BRANDMA SAYS WE CANNOT receive uh um let's see here. He uh uh he hallelujah. He says the the the seed you so potentially IT'S IN THERE. WHAT IS IT? THE WORD PROMISED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. And around there this only reflects the negative. This talking about the body. Amen. BUT THAT WILL REFLECT THE POSITIVE. THE WORD THE SAME THING THE TRANSL UH THE TRANSLATION OF THE PRIDE WILL BE THE SAME THING THE WORD THAT'S IN YOU THE BODY WILL materialize around that word the same as it did by Sarah &gt;&gt; JUST BELIEVING THE WORD AND THE BODY THE baby will begin to grow around that word &gt;&gt; it took a prophet IN THIS DAY TO TELL US THESE THINGS THAT IT'S NOT RELIGION. THIS IS NOT RELIGION. IT TOOK A PROPHET TO COME BRING THE WORD. WHY THE WORD? Because the word that you're feasting on is the word THAT IS BRINGING ABOUT THE CHANGE, BRINGING ABOUT THE MANIFESTATION OF THE PROMISES OF GOD. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT YOUR that your uh uh uh bedding ground is pure. Can you say amen? Amen. And so he says that seed it will take hold somewhere. Glory to God. The only thing he's looking for today is a bedding GROUND SOMEWHERE THAT it can bed. &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of transformation. He says that gives us faith. AND WHAT HE SAID HERE HE IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT WHAT HE SAYS THE PROMISES THAT HE SPOKE FOR THIS DAY IS going to be &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; it's going to be somebody say it's going to be &gt;&gt; because there is a if you want to brother Brandham would say now you are not like Eve That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, she fell. And he says, "And then the seed come, God had him a bride coming out of Pentecost." &gt;&gt; Amen. And then she committed adultery and she went off. She fell. But you know what the prophet said concerning you? &gt;&gt; He said, "But this last day bride cannot fail." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She cannot fail. AND HERE WE'VE GOT MORE WE'VE GOT MORE AGAINST THE BRIDE TODAY THAN ANY OTHER DAY. &gt;&gt; If there's anything to to to Amen. to to come into the womb of the heart today, it's it's here with with all of the junk. BUT YET GOD SAYS THERE'S GOING TO BE A WOMAN. She's going to be my woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's going to have my love. She's going to be a woman that maybe has a lot of mistakes like Sarah. Going to have a lot of hardships. Amen. A lot of things going around you. Amen. But you know what? She is mine. I am hers. We She is going to provide or she is going to come forth. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; She's going to manifest. Amen. Manifest the words of of eternal life. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brandham would talk about there in in in in the 18th chapter of uh uh he's he's talking about Abraham and Genesis. He says now Nean he said the 17th chapter now he gave him strength for the miracle give him the Holy Ghost. In other words, let him draw his own God's own life into his own. He says now what what do we do when we receive the Holy Ghost? We take God's life into ours. Is that right? He says, "What?" We blend God's life in ours. We're sons of God because we draw from God. The Holy Spirit that makes us sons of God. What does that do? Amen. It gets us ready then for the change. &gt;&gt; SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE 17TH CHAPTER, they received, it was a type OF THEM RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST. And then the 18th CHAPTER IS WHEN THE WORD CAME TO THEM &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD THAT'S WHEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED. PROPHET GOD APPEARED AND SAID SARAH IS GOING TO HAVE THAT BABY. And Sarah was laughing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Sarah saying I don't see how this can be. Now watch what brother Brandham would say. Amen. About that. He says notice immediately after that Sarah become pregnant. She knew she was going to have this baby. Now, now she's she's young now. She's beautiful. Even a king fell in love with her and and she and and she would have to be outstanding or that king would have never fallen in love with her. You know, she was a beautiful woman. She and and he wanted to marry her and God protected her. One more thing I want to get to the church. Now, some of you sitting here, last night when the anointing struck me, I feel them little flares in there. I I've been trying to think of it and I jotted it down here so I won't wouldn't forget it. I caught that last night that you said, "Well, I did so and so. I did so and so." Many times I FIND PEOPLE WON'T EVEN COME INTO THE PRAYER line because and they won't even come into THE PRAYER LINE. THEY WON'T EVEN TAKE THEIR NUMBER WHEN they're called. They're afraid that things will be called up certain things. Now, I used to BLAST THAT RIGHT OUT. You all know that. And and not unless I'm I'm actually uh uh led to do it. I don't do it no more. Amen. You Now, you will make mistakes. YOU SAY, "BROTHER BRANDHAM, NO MATTER WHAT I EVER DO, I'LL NEVER BE WORTHY." That's right. But look, you say, "Brother Brandham, at one time I didn't believe the message." I I guess many of you didn't. I I wouldn't I wouldn't have done it, I guess, myself. I I couldn't have done it unless God revealed it to me. See, it's a revelation. The whole church is built on the revelation. Without the revelation, you'll never see it. You're blind. He said the the Bible says in Matthew 12, I believe it was uh where he said, "Though Jesus had done so many miracles before them, yet they could not believe because Isaiah said they got eyes they can't see and ears they can't hear." Uh so very really holy people, THE CREAM OF THE CROP. SO HOLINESS IS NOT ALL. HOLY LIVING IS NOT ALL. Faith is the main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm going to repeat it to you again. HOLINESS IS NOT ALL. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; Holy living is not all. &gt;&gt; Faith is the main thing. Now he's not excusing anything but he's saying if you don't have the bedding ground if it's not an open womb before be it unto me ACCORDING TO THY WORD &gt;&gt; all things are not possible then &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; so we got to keep that heart of faith &gt;&gt; then all things are possible &gt;&gt; is that right &gt;&gt; now now watch he says the holiness was not all holy living is not all faith is the main thing now Listen, church, I want to drop this in here cuz I believe the Holy Spirit told me to do it. You may be sitting there, which some of you are. I know you are. You're disagreeing with me right now. Now, I could call your name if you want me to. So, know that. But I can also see further than that &gt;&gt; that you're going to believe it one of these days. You come from him. You come out of him. You're part of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it takes divine revelation to ignite it as to who you are. And that's why we preach service after service. We lay it in line upon line. We do. The Bible said it would be that way. line upon line. Amen. Uh uh what's the next word? Uh &gt;&gt; precept upon precept. Here a little, there a little. Will I come before you? Is that right? It's his word and it's coming. But but but then but what's doing it? It's the word. The word that you're eating &gt;&gt; is changing you. The word you're eating is creating faith in you. &gt;&gt; That's it. Oh, glory to God. Now, now he says, "Now, I'm just going to put this in so you'll understand. So, I can give you a little spot of grace here when ain't going to be too long till you're going to change your mind. Some of you will. Now, some of you won't. But remember, when Sarah first heard that man, uh, which she's a type of the church, when she heard that and seen the sign take place to Abraham, she actually laughed about it in her heart. She disbelieved and doubt and doubted it ever being. So, IS THAT RIGHT? NOW, AT THAT TIME, God would have rubbed her name off. Is that right? He But he couldn't. SHE'S PART OF ABRAHAM. They are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This ain't a church membership. The feminine part OF GOD IS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Right here. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I it it says uh uh and and if and if and if you've been if you've really not been excited or not worked up in an emotion, not got some church creed, but really received the Holy Ghost, really received the Holy Ghost, and you're really part of Christ and still a little skeptic in your mind, GOD WILL NOT SHOVE you off from that because he can't. You're part of Christ and he'll bring you to the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody can say right there with that quote, "Be it unto me." &gt;&gt; If I've been guilty of of being skeptical, &gt;&gt; well, can God heal me? Well, can God do this? Well, will God, Lord, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Give me grace. Open my Come on, church. This I'm telling you, there's a faith that God's wanting to operate in you like nobody's business. There is a glory. Amen. You were in him. This is your day. Arise, shine, for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. THIS IS OUR DAY, little bride. THIS IS OUR DAY. THIS IS OUR DAY TO BE PREGNANT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR DAY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY WHEN brother Brandham in the early years was saying, "Amen, we're going to we're going to get married when we get on the other side." But back here, Amen. these last few months of his of his being here, he's saying, "No, YOU ARE MARRIED. YOU HAVE YOU HAVE GOT AN INVISIBLE UNION RIGHT NOW." &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; The bedding grounds. Keep the bedding grounds pure. Now that's that's one thing that you can do. Satan Satan fights you one way or the other. But you just remember what I'm saying. Amen. Hallelujah. Undefiled. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. He says now it's it's he says it now that gives us faith then that what he said here it's going to be. So let that seed fall into our hearts that we might be the bedding grounds of that. See, it's our hearts. Let us act out this place that he has placed us in in these last days. See, LET THE SEED FALL IN OUR HEARTS, LORD. LET THY WORD FALL IN MY HEART. Let there not be any unbelief. No unbelief in me, Lord. Amen. Look at ME, FATHER. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. Sometimes I I I I I'M SKEPTICAL. SOMETIMES I'M I'M ASKING QUESTIONS SOMETIMES. BUT OH GOD, I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART, YOU'RE MINE, AND I'M YOURS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. There's a womb. There's a womb. Remember, Amen. Proving his word. Brother Brandon would say, "Don't you see IN THE SHADOWS?" STOP HERE A MINUTE. IN THE LAST DAYS, THERE'S GOT TO BE A PLACE PREPARED FOR the word to be made manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 11:26-65. Amen. Brother Brandon prays. He stops while he's preaching and he says, "Oh God, I'm hoping I hope I'm speaking to ground prepared tonight. If the seed can fall in the right place, it's going to be something. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. That's a promise. &gt;&gt; Do you understand why Satan wants to try to get us out of unbelief? But even when he's got us out of unbelief or or got us out of faith and he's and he's and he's pointing all the unbelief and the questions of our minds and the different things like that, we need to take them right back to these quotes that God sent to us to stabilize us. &gt;&gt; EVE WAS PART OF ADAM. THAT'S WHY ADAM FOLLOWED HER OUT OF THE GARDEN. Come on. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PART OF CHRIST. THAT'S WHY GOD CAME OUT OF THE PARADISES OF HEAVEN DOWN TO THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO PAY THE PRICE OF REDEMPTION TO BRING YOU BACK. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT GOING TO PAY THAT PRICE IN VAIN. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO DIE IN VAIN. Every one of God's predestinated seed will be there. &gt;&gt; And what he put you on earth to do, you can you can bet your bottom dollar &gt;&gt; that you're going to be there. You're going to do it. Now, what it does do to us is even though I'm I'm I I I I can be a little shaky, there's one thing that I've got to do is guard that womb. I refuse to let another seed into the womb of my heart. &gt;&gt; I may be shaky. I'm question. But Sarah ain't going to go out man and let another man put seed in her womb. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And the bride of Jesus Christ is married. He's she's married to him. &gt;&gt; And our LIFE CAN ONLY COME FROM HIM. AND SHE'S WAITING ON HIM PATIENTLY IN LOVE. WAITING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I WONDER. I QUESTION SOMETIMES. BUT THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT IT. I'M MARRIED TO YOU. AND YOUR WORD IS MY EVERYTHING. IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT live in me, nothing else will. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. God. &gt;&gt; Oh God. OH GOD. FOR THE POWER OF GOD'S creation comes by his spirit germinating the seed, the life, the word within your heart. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now now brother Brandham in the choosing of the bride he would say now we find today the modern church a modern world church there's the modern world church and also the spiritual church and both are pregnantated to give birth to sons one of them is a denominational birth and it's going to give one of these days at the world council of churches which will produce the world to the world the antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth I may not live to see I believe I will. But you young people remember that you heard a minister say that it'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast and she forms the world council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the antichrist. But he says, "But the other is pregnantated by the word &gt;&gt; and will bring forth the body, the finished body of Jesus Christ, which is the word uh which is the bride." &gt;&gt; So there is another woman that is coming up and the word is coming in her and maturing her. AND THIS BRIDE IS GOING TO BE THE FINISHED body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; She's going to be the matured body of JESUS CHRIST. AND SHE IS GOING to be pregnantated too. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, the body of Christ isn't finished yet." How many knows that? Amen. And and and and you know, that was way BACK THAT WAS WAY BACK IN ' 65. HERE WE ARE IN 2025. SO, SO, BROTHER BRADMAN, 63, he was saying that the the the virgin bride is in her infant stage. That's right. &gt;&gt; The the emp was that in ' 61 where where where the where where the five stars come together and and uh brother Brandamus he said now that was a sign in the heavens. God brought the five stars together. Grace to the elect. He said a a an infant bride is now on earth. Now that was back there in the 60s. But now today there is a there there is a a more clearer picture. We've been able to go IN AND LOOK BACK. We can archive. We've got them. We we we we can hear the tapes. WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ALL before us. AND AND THIS WORD that we're eating, don't you DON'T YOU THINK IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR YOU, JESSE? AMY, don't you think it's not doing ANYTHING FOR YOU. THE WORDS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE EATING and you're REGURGITATING ON IS DOING SOMETHING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, we can't teach it. We can't teach it. And neither do you teach your body your food. Hallelujah. All right. I want this food. You want I want this food to to to to do this and this food to do that. Just just just eat and your body will take care of the rest of it. Right. And God has built you. You're the bride. Just eat the word. Eat the word. Eat the word. Keep eating the word. Eat the word. Eat the word. We We want to get away from well, you know, man's ideas and man's opin and our feelings. WE GOT TO GET AWAY from these stinking feelings, &gt;&gt; you know, WE LET OURSELVES GET SO HARDENED BECAUSE WE, YOU KNOW, AND PRIDE DOES IT. WE JUST GET SO STINKING PRIDEFUL AND THEN WE GET SET IN our ways and and we know WE'RE WRONG. YOU KNOW YOU'RE WRONG WHEN YOU'RE WRONG. JUST JUST get rid of those feelings and say, "Lord, I'M GOING TO LAY THEM AT THE ALTAR HERE. YEAH, IT IS. I I if I do not if I do not give birth to the word, then I'm missing my purpose for being here. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; And we're fixing to go home, folks. This is our time to give birth to that word. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Take it serious. Keep the womb. I don't care. I don't care. Keep the womb. Amen. Pure and holy. Keep eating that word. Live that word. Amen. Breathe that word. Just And brother Brandham says, "Don't make yourself some spiritual giant." &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon when he was preaching the the the the future home of the heavenly bride, the heavenly groom and the earthly bride. He asked when he when he's coming out, he's asked Billy Paul, "Billy, did or Billy said, "That was a good sermon." And and brother Brandham says, "Did you understand what I SAID, BILLY?" "OH, YEAH." He looked back over at him with those dark eyes, deep set eyes. "Billy, did you understand what daddy was preaching? No sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's okay, Billy." &gt;&gt; I could count on one hand, how many people understood what I was preaching this morning, but that's not important. &gt;&gt; The important thing, son, is that you believe it. &gt;&gt; So, it's not in how you can regurgitate it up here. It's how you can say this was God's word sent to me. &gt;&gt; That word is what pregnant you. &gt;&gt; That word is what brings forth babies. &gt;&gt; Spiritual babies. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Don't shut the seed out. Let it come. Don't understand how it works. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I just want to be pregnant with his word. and his words coming out of the mouth of a prophet. They're divine words. They're divine words. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. I told you it's going to be I I I was going to be real quick here tonight. I Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, now remember, he says, "Now the other one is pregnant by the word will bring forth the body, the finished body of Christ, the bride." Amen. The bride, the body of Christ isn't finished yet. How many knows that? Man and woman are one. Christ is the body, the word. The bride will have to be the rest of that body. And we talked about that this morning. And the two together makes the one body again. Now, how do they do that? When they come together in union and they have their baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. The marriage come together in union. the the the THE BABY CONSUMMATES A MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; It's when the two become one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So Christ, he he says now uh the it says uh the the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together make one body like Adam was at the beginning. Man and his wife are one. She the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own. It his mind of course it's his will. His will is his word. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Spoken word. He says, "AND WE WERE SOLD WITH the word. SOMEDAY I'LL BRING THE LIFE INTO the earth and replenish the earth." WHAT EVE FAILED TO DO, Mary did. She took the word. EVE TOOK SATAN'S LIE. MARY TOOK GOD'S word and through Mary's seed replenishes the earth through his bride, me and you, through his word and will bring up the millennium through that goes forth the word and the word is planted into every predestinated heart. &gt;&gt; So, amen. This one here, this Christ child that was born, this mysterious one, he has a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now together, Amen. Through the bride, through his word, the the Mary's seed, which is you and I, replenishes the earth again through his ride and through the word and will bring up the millennium. You talking about giving birth? Are y'all understanding &gt;&gt; what we're doing? What we're doing? We're taking the word of God, the fruit must come &gt;&gt; and the millennium. I love that quote. Amen. And it will bring up the millennium. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you you ladies sometimes have those big old babies and you think, "Woo, how did she do that?" Amen. And and uh Amen. But I'm here to tell you, this bride is so pregnant. Amen. And she's got such divine promise that she is going to produce the millennium. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The eternal gene seed of God. Amen. Those words that are coming into your what you are believing is going to bring will bring it about. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Impregnated. Somebody say amen. Sew your seed in me, Lord. Sew your seed in me. Brother Brandham would say from that that little group of the true seed of the word, God will present Christ a beloved bride, a virgin of his word, and through them and by them will be fulfilled ALL THAT has been promised. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I think sometimes the Lord the Lord lets us go through the dry spells, lets us go through different times in our I think he he you know Abraham and Sarah had to wait for 25 years and sometimes the Lord does those things but usually usually if he's if if there's someone in here tonight that's in a dry spell it it it it doesn't mean that you're not pregnant, it doesn't mean that God's word's not in you. In fact, the prophet of God says once that womb has sealed that word, it will not accept another seed into the womb. &gt;&gt; I know I'm speaking pretty pretty strong here tonight. Amen. He says, "But once the bride accepts the seed of God into her womb and shuts that womb, Amen, it will not receive seed from anything else." &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM. YOU KNOW HIM. YOU KNOW HIM. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT THE SECOND GOD OF THE GODHEAD. HE IS GOD. &gt;&gt; And you're his bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Well, do you love him here tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT WAS IN MARY. Now remember he says through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the virgin who knows no man-made creeds or dogmas the word of promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill all that is written of him as he did when when he came from the virgin womb type of the spirit womb now amen so will the virgin now accepting his word. Be it unto me as thou has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I wanted to I wanted to share some of those with you here today. &gt;&gt; If you if you accept the seed of God, if if if you accept it, man, you young people, I want to just talk to you for a minute. You young people well all of us but especially young people if you accept the message of the hour and and you are you are saying here I am then then you will want it exactly you'll want you you want to give birth to that a and now now today there's not too many people that wants to give have babies &gt;&gt; amen there's just not a whole lot of people that want to have babies anymore they've got a lot of things going on. And brother Brandon talked about it and I'll read it here in a minute, but he talked about it way back in ' 65. &gt;&gt; But but it's but it's really the case a lot here today. They've got careers. They got a lot of things going on. The man and the woman, they're they don't want babies. &gt;&gt; And and and and so they're not fulfilling their They're not they're not replenishing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of course, as many idiots as there are in the world today, it's best they don't have babies. Amen. and u but some of them anyways maybe we should retract that but brother Brandham says if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's got to mother something it's her nature but to bear a child for her husband and raise it into the service of God that's entirely out of her line oh she'd be disgraced if she did by her sinloving society of 1965 five type of women. A true picture of the modern church today. Neither does the modern church want any of these here screaming, shouting, &gt;&gt; tongue speaking Acts 238 youngans around her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. See, yeah. She don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen and hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination. And they they had one like that in one of the churches. Why? They had throw her out right quick. Why are you letting such things go on? So you can see she's pregnantated with something cuz she's BRINGING FORTH MEMBERS ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; BUT SHE DON'T WANT none of them screaming, hollering, blabbering, Acts 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are. &gt;&gt; It would certainly embarrass her. It would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society of church where she belongs. They would throw her out at the next council. She can't have it. So she don't want to be pregnantated with the word because that's the only kind the word can produce. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So we don't want to be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, the other day in the in the play, you you you all uh were shouting. You kids were shouting, "Amen." and and uh uh you know you were I I know was a part of the skit, but I I the thing is is now when we were when we were doing the practice before you guys were really a shouting and uh then when the skit came along he was a little bit more quiet and then when today comes along hallelujah. Now, that was impersonating. That was an act. That was Now, I'm hoping y'all was some of y'all were saying amen to what I was what what I was trying to say at the end. But we can have an act. We can have an act right here in the church &gt;&gt; in our church services. But remember, the only kind of birth that God that the Bible produces, as the prophet would say, Amen. The only kind the word can bring forth is those miserable, screaming, hollering, blabbering. Acts 2:38, miserable youngans. And that acts, Amen. That's those who have repented, been baptized in Jesus' name, and filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't always all act the same, but the but what happens, Amen. The kind of pregnantation that God DOES TO BRING ABOUT the new birth in you will be a scriptural one, it's one that brings desire. &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost, you're that new creation that I preached about this morning. That new creation Amen. God Jesus created his own bride. &gt;&gt; And that new creation, you know, when the new creation because all of a sudden your senses, your desires, your everything is I I want to give him a child. I I I I want his word to live through me. My desire your desire is no longer anything else. The flirting days are over. The sin days are over. the the looking at junk is that you have one desire. I want to please him. You then know that you have you're the new creation. You then know that's what the Bible produces. Your desires have changed. Your desires. SO SO SO THEREFORE you aren't and and and and I say there should not be anything inhibit you. If you want to stand up, if there if if if there is something screaming out in you saying amen to the preacher, you ought to do it. Not not hold that back at all. There's no difference between an adult and a and a cat, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Oh, yes, there is. Amen. My mama knows everything about me and I have to answer to her." Well, you know what? Us adults know a lot about each other, too. But you know, when we come to the house of God, we're not worried about I'm not worried about Brother Merl, what he thinks about me, and he's not worried about Brother Steve, what he thinks about him. And brother Steve is not worried about Brother Simeon, what he thinks. We come for a purpose. &gt;&gt; We're created FROM HIM. WE'RE BONE OF HIS BONE. WE'RE FLESH OF HIS FLESH. WHEN THE WORD IS BEING PREACHED, THERE'S SOMETHING IN OUR HEART THAT IS SCREAMING OUT, "SAY, BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO THY WORD." IT'S NOT AN ACT. IT'S NOT A PUT ON. IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT WITHIN US THAT HAS PRODUCED A YOUNG THAT LOVES HIS WORD, LOVES HIS PURPOSE, DESIRES FOR HIS WORD TO BE MADE REAL AND LIVING in him. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't settle for anything less. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The brother Bam says, "Oh, you're born of the spirit of God. It has the spirit of God in it." No intellectual churchgoing, joining, creed going, bobbed hair, painted face. There's no such a thing as that in it at all. You don't find that in the word of God. You find an oldfashioned sanctified, Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit of God, screaming, hollering, shouting, AND PRAISING GOD. HOW MANY WANTS TO BE THAT KIND OF A OF a have that kind of a baby? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we just want to keep on eating. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Amen. He says, "Now, we cannot receive the promised son." Amen. That's that's promised us today in these bodies that we live in. These bodies are sin. This first conscious controls this body with see, taste, feel, smell, hear, and it's just got us all scrupled up. So he says, "Now you're not," and and I'm closing. I am closing, but he's saying you're not going to be able to receive the promised son, Jesus Christ, the millennium, the new the the the the new bodies. You're not going to be able to receive that if you're walking in the five senses. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being fruitful. And I want you to really catch me to pinch yourself for a minute because I don't I I I don't want the devil lulling uh you you to sleep yet. Amen. I promise. I'm fixing to close. He said, "We cannot receive the promised son that's promised us today in these bodies that we live in. These bodies are sin. You and you cannot re you cannot accept the word in this these bodies here too. The first conscience controls this body. See, taste, feel, smell here." And it's just got us all scrupled up. It's freezing everything else. But that new body that comes from this born again, not the first conscience, it'll pass away. It's that inside something that lives. So you're going to have the new birth. The new birth that that new birth is is when is when Eve is taken out of the body and the and the and the life is put within her and she wakes up and she sees who she IS AND ADAM'S LOOKING AT HER AND SAYING BONE OF MY BONE FLESH OF MY FLESH SHE COME FROM MAN SHE'S PART of me right it becomes a LOVE AFFAIR THERE. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS SO, SO HE'S SAYING YOU CAN'T RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE STILL DEAD. CONSCIENCE, TASTE, MEMORY, and all of these things here. But, but he says now, Amen. So, he says IT'S IT'S BUT THAT COMES but there's a new uh but the new body that comes from this born again. It's that inside something that lives. Everybody understand it? Say amen. HE SAYS IT'S NOT THIS OUTSIDE SEE, TASTE, SMELL, uh uh feel here. It isn't. It's subject to death and will die. But the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die. And that's the person that the new life starts from. And from this new birth and and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life. So potentially it's in here. What is it? The word promised before the foundation of the world. Yes. &gt;&gt; So that's the real you chosen in him. You're part of him. That's who you are. And around there, this only around here, this thing here reflects the negative. He says, "But that will reflect the positive, the word." And the translation of the bride will be the same thing. The word that's in you, the body will materialize around that word. &gt;&gt; SOMEONE SHOUT HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This body cannot do it. So it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the son. Well, I just love him. &gt;&gt; I just love him. Hallelujah. Amen. So So I wanted to finish my thoughts on this. Amen. OH, CHRISTMAS IS far more than than than all of the elves and Santaas and socks and stockings and and all of that. Amen. It's far more than that. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? M Amen. That's what the devil wants you to look at. You know, hallelujah. But that's not what God That's what the true Christmas was about. That's what it was about. Amen. God becoming a flesh. God creating himself. God taking the Amen. the bride out of that Christ living his life through her and her having children. her producing. Well, praise the Lord &gt;&gt; right now. It can it can be anything. Amen. Whatever he says, whatever God will lead your soul to believe, &gt;&gt; whatever God would lead your soul to believe. What is that? &gt;&gt; Whatever he will pregnant you with &gt;&gt; can happen. Well, there's no telling what God can do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Hallelujah. Whatever heal I Oh my. How did we How did any of these miracles that we've that we've known over the years? How many How how could the any of these kinds of things do in of the supernatural? It's God just coming down and leading someone. It wasn't because they prayed and fasted and and wanted to be. Yes, they were a virgin to his word and not allowing other things in their hearts and minds, &gt;&gt; not allowing other things to plant seeds. But now, Amen. and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit would just drop something down in their heart &gt;&gt; and something great would take place &gt;&gt; if the musicians would come. God bless you. I wanted to finish my my my thoughts on that. Amen. Uh uh be I I I want I want to be pregnant. Amen. I want I want as God's bride. I'm a member of his bride. I don't want I don't want to be pregnant in the natural. Amen. But I'm a member of his bride. Amen. And and and you girls that are that are waiting uh you know waiting for for uh looking you're you know that you haven't you haven't been married yet and you're you're looking for you're looking for God to send you that husband. Amen. That desire is there. Well, it'll happen. Just as there was an Eve, there had to be an Adam. And and and God's got those things here for us. But what you want, you want that to where it'll be a beautiful union. That's why we keep ourselves pure before men, pure on the internet, pure around. We don't want to tarnish we don't want to tarnish our um uh our image because we don't want we don't want our we always say Romeo but we don't want our Adam to pass us up and think man I I I I you want you want your Adam to look at you and say oh man she makes my heart Peter patter And uh so so so you want you want a purity. Keep keep yourself present yourself pure. I think that's okay. Don't y'all? &gt;&gt; Amen. I there's there's there's a there listen there's you don't want to attract anything but your Adam. You don't want to attract anything else. And I don't want to attract anything but God in my life. &gt;&gt; I don't want to attract anything else. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Some things draw flies. Amen. Huh? I want to draw Jesus. I want to draw Jesus. Well, I love him from everything that I've read. And I and I just I just put some of these quotes here. I was planning on just reading them, but there's just such a sweet spirit here. I thought I'd talk a little bit here, too. There's a lot in the message on the womb and pregnant of God's word. I I just I I I I I say it's God's desire for us to be fruitful. God's not called you to be his wife and then and then you be a unic. Can a woman be a unic? No, I don't guess so. Celibus or what? Whatever. I don't know the term. Nonpregant, unfruitful, where the word has no effect in the womb. God God don't call us for that. God calls us to be fruitful. It's his desire. That's what he wants. &gt;&gt; That's why he married you. He wants his word to have an effect in us. &gt;&gt; Well, come on. I mean, I I I was I I was looking back there in the office uh uh uh or they're they're at the house and uh you know um you know where they're in in in Isaiah says uh in his death he will see his seed and and talking about the Adam the Eve coming out and then and then the next verse It it's coming out and his days shall be prolonged. What what what does that mean? In other words, there is fruitfulness that is going to be taking place. In other words, there's going to be a God in bodies on the earth throughout the generations. It's just this generation is coming to its completion. &gt;&gt; Well, glory, glory, glory, glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do your I can stand secure right upon my heart. Truth that sets me free &gt;&gt; according to your word. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; be it unto me. &gt;&gt; Oh, be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to your word.
