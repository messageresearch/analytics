[35:49] places where brother Brandon was praying
[35:51] that that I want to read in in the
[35:53] comforter as he's praying he says oh

[35:58] all good gifts sanctify our unclean
[36:01] hearts Lord May the angel come from the
[36:04] altar with the tongs and with a coal of
[36:06] fire and touch our lips and our hearts

[36:15] remembrance of Our Lord for it is
[36:17] written he that eats and drinks

[38:27] eight it says but thou Israel art my
[38:30] servant Jacob whom I have chosen the
[38:33] Seed of Abraham my
[38:35] friend thou whom I have taken from the
[38:37] ends of the Earth and called from the
[38:40] chief men thereof and said unto the Thou
[38:43] Art my servant I have chosen thee and
[38:46] not cast thee
[38:47] away and Isaiah chapter
[38:50] 44 starting at verse
[38:52] one yet now here oh Jacob my servant and
[38:56] Israel whom I have chosen thus sayeth
[38:59] the Lord that made thee and formed the
[39:01] from the room from the womb which will
[39:03] help thee fear not oh Jacob my servant
[39:06] and now just run whom I have chosen for
[39:08] I will pour water upon him that is
[39:10] thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I
[39:13] will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my
[39:15] blessing upon thine Offspring and they
[39:18] shall spring up as among the grass as
[39:20] willows by the water courses one shall
[39:23] say I am the Lords and another shall
[39:25] call himself by the name of Jacob and
[39:27] another shall subscribe with his hand
[39:29] unto the Lord and surname himself by the
[39:31] name of Israel
[39:41] okay now when we break
[39:44] into the story of Abraham as we were
[39:46] beginning to read
[39:48] here there's really nothing that is
[39:51] written about what kind of man Abram was
[39:54] before God called him it doesn't lay out
[39:57] that he was a good man it doesn't lay
[40:00] out that he was an evil man it doesn't
[40:02] lay out that he was this or that he was
[40:06] just there we go through his lineage we
[40:09] go through the line that he came from
[40:12] but God doesn't give us anything that
[40:15] would try to set him apart as wow this
[40:18] is what was special about him this is
[40:20] why I chose him he doesn't lay out
[40:23] anything like that he simply goes Abra
[40:27] right I want you to separate yourself
[40:29] and I want you to go
[40:31] off he doesn't say it's well you know
[40:34] Abram had rejected the gods of his of
[40:38] his people he had turned away from this
[40:40] and so it was the right time to call him
[40:42] he doesn't go in about how well Abram
[40:45] clung to the beliefs of his grandfather
[40:47] or
[40:48] great-grandfather or anything it doesn't
[40:52] tell us that it's not setting Abram as
[40:55] being something special or being
[40:57] something that is different than what
[40:59] was
[41:00] there what was different was that he was
[41:04] chosen what was different was that God
[41:07] looked down and saw something on the
[41:09] inside and said that's the one I
[41:13] want what was different was that God
[41:15] could look at him and go I know what
[41:18] he's going to do in the future I know
[41:20] how he'll respond I know how he'll
[41:23] handle the different
[41:24] things he's the one I
[41:27] want it wasn't because of anything he
[41:29] had done in the past it wasn't because
[41:30] of anything he had done to make himself
[41:33] worthy it was because of what God could
[41:36] see in him and God could
[41:39] know Abram Abraham is my
[41:44] friend that he would be able to look at
[41:47] him before he got to that point and go
[41:51] this man is going to be my friend this
[41:54] man is going to be someone that I can
[41:55] talk to this this is going to be someone
[41:57] that will listen to what I have to say
[41:59] that will follow my Commandments that
[42:01] will do what I tell him to
[42:03] do was he a perfect man
[42:07] no but the character was there that God
[42:10] was looking for the character was there
[42:12] that God could look at him and say
[42:15] that's mine that's the one that I want
[42:17] that's
[42:18] right in the sermon
[42:21] Abraham says now Abraham came down to
[42:23] the land of CH caldia in the city of er
[42:25] to well there and they probably lived a
[42:28] pretty fair life in those days he
[42:30] probably picked berries for his
[42:31] breakfast and go in the bush and kill an
[42:33] animal for his no day and then eat some
[42:35] more berries at night and so forth and
[42:37] he fared pretty good but one day while
[42:39] he was walking around at 75 years old
[42:42] and he had married his Half Sister Sarah
[42:44] when they was just a girl and she was 65
[42:46] years old she was 10 years younger than
[42:49] Abraham and Abraham walking around God
[42:51] called Abraham by Grace by election he
[42:54] called Abraham and chose him among all
[42:56] the men in the world God called Abraham
[42:58] because he wanted to give Abraham his
[43:00] Covenant yeah in faith it says now
[43:03] Abraham was called by election Abraham
[43:06] is election Isaac is justification Jacob
[43:08] is Grace and Joseph is perfection now in
[43:11] the beginning when God called Abraham he
[43:13] called him not because he was a good man
[43:15] but because God fornew Abraham God knew
[43:19] what Abraham would do he knowed Abraham
[43:21] he said I know that Abraham will raise
[43:24] his children to fear the lord
[43:26] God knowed him God knows
[43:30] you in Hebrews chap 11 and starting at
[43:33] verse 8 it says by faith Abraham when he
[43:36] was called to go out into a place which
[43:38] he should after receive for an
[43:40] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[43:43] knowing whether he went by faith he
[43:45] sojourned in the land of promise as in a
[43:47] strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[43:50] with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him
[43:53] of the same promise for he looked for a
[43:55] city which had foundations and whose
[43:58] Builder and maker is
[44:03] God once again in the serum
[44:06] Abraham he says he told Abraham said now
[44:08] separate yourself from among your people
[44:11] that's the best thing to do come out
[44:13] from among it get away from it someone
[44:15] said well I still go to the pool room I
[44:18] think I think maybe I could win some of
[44:19] the boys stay out of the pool room stay
[44:22] off the Devil's Ground that's right
[44:23] you'll never do it that way set separate
[44:26] yourself and show your color be a
[44:28] Christian and act like it live like it
[44:31] talk like it people will believe it
[44:33] notice Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll
[44:36] draw all men to me lift him up in your
[44:38] life in your living and in what you
[44:44] do the first thing that when God comes
[44:49] to to Abram and lets him know that I'm
[44:52] choosing you the first thing he said
[44:56] says is separate
[45:00] yourself there it's not recorded in
[45:02] Scripture that the Lord had come and
[45:04] talk to Abram before this could he have
[45:08] sure but I think it probably would have
[45:10] been in the
[45:13] scriptures but God came and talked to
[45:15] Abram and his first command is separate
[45:20] leave your family behind leave your
[45:22] friends behind leave everything that you
[45:24] know behind
[45:26] and go to a place that I'm going to show
[45:28] you I'm choosing you and now it's time
[45:32] for you to be
[45:33] different I'm choosing you and it's time
[45:36] for you to step away from everything he
[45:39] didn't say okay Abram I choose you and
[45:41] now I want you to go witness to your
[45:42] neighbors I want you to go witness to
[45:44] your friends I want you to go witness to
[45:46] your
[45:48] co-workers he didn't say any of that it
[45:51] was I choose you now
[45:54] leave because say we need to get away
[45:58] together the two of us we need to be
[46:00] separated so that everyone can see
[46:02] there's a difference here everybody can
[46:06] see that there's something different in
[46:08] the way that you're living and you can
[46:09] see that there's something different in
[46:11] the way that you're acting and the way
[46:13] that you're carrying yourself and the
[46:15] way that you're handling
[46:18] situations you've been
[46:20] chosen and now you need to leave and you
[46:23] need to be
[46:24] separated isn't interesting how that's
[46:26] the pairing that we immediately find out
[46:28] is when God chooses his First Act is you
[46:32] need to
[46:33] separate you need to separate from the
[46:36] world that you've known you need to
[46:38] separate from the world that you've
[46:40] previously been a part of and instead
[46:43] you need to come into what I'm calling
[46:45] you to you need to come into what I've
[46:47] set aside for you where the place that
[46:50] I've called you to
[46:54] be
[46:56] 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 starting at
[46:59] verse 14 it
[47:01] says now we exhort you
[47:04] Brethren warn them that are
[47:06] unruly Comfort the
[47:08] feeble-minded support the weak be
[47:11] patient toward all men see that none
[47:14] render evil for evil unto any man but
[47:17] ever follow that which is good both
[47:20] among yourselves and to all men Rejoice
[47:23] Evermore pray without ceasing
[47:26] in everything give thanks for this is
[47:28] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[47:30] concerning you quench not the spirit
[47:34] despise not prophesying prove all things
[47:38] hold fast that which is good abstain
[47:41] from all appearance of evil and the Very
[47:44] God of Peace sanctify you holy and I
[47:47] pray God your whole spirit and soul and
[47:50] body be preserved blameless unto the
[47:53] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:58] if you run through this section of
[48:00] scripture verse by
[48:03] verse everything about it is going to be
[48:06] going hey I want you to be different
[48:09] than the
[48:12] world I want you
[48:14] to not render evil for
[48:18] evil hey first off we're going to break
[48:20] the Old Testament notion of eye for an
[48:22] eye we're already moving away from that
[48:24] so don't render evil for evil don't try
[48:27] to get
[48:28] even hey they hurt me okay ignore it
[48:33] forgive continue on don't render evil
[48:35] for
[48:38] evil ever follow that which is good both
[48:41] among yourselves and to all
[48:43] men Rejoice everm
[48:46] more okay Evermore is
[48:49] always ever more is
[48:52] continually Evermore isn't Rejoice now
[48:55] and then tomorrow when you're upset at
[48:56] work stop
[48:58] rejoicing or it's not rejoice now and
[49:01] then tomorrow when the kids are acting
[49:02] up stop
[49:04] rejoicing it's Rejoice ever more keep
[49:08] rejoicing keep being thankful keep
[49:12] praising pray without
[49:15] ceasing in everything give
[49:21] thanks it's kind of hard to be
[49:23] complaining if we're continually being
[49:24] thankful
[49:26] if we're focusing on well Lord I'm
[49:29] thankful for this it's kind of hard to
[49:31] be complaining about whatever situation
[49:35] or whatever
[49:37] problem and so we run through these
[49:39] verses and God is laying out through
[49:41] Paul you're separated you're supposed to
[49:44] be different you're supposed to be
[49:47] carrying yourself in a different way
[49:48] you're supposed to be acting a different
[49:53] way that verse 22 in in 1 Thessalonians
[49:56] chapter 5 it's abstained from all
[49:59] appearance of
[50:04] evil he's not saying abstain from
[50:08] Evil he's saying abstain from the very
[50:13] appearance it might not be evil but if
[50:16] it looks or seems like someone could
[50:19] think that you were doing evil don't do
[50:22] it that's right even if it's fine
[50:26] even if you don't have the slightest
[50:28] guilt you don't have the slightest
[50:31] condemnation in doing
[50:34] it if you think there's a possibility
[50:37] that it could be taken as evil that
[50:39] someone looking at it could go he's
[50:42] doing the wrong thing or she's acting
[50:44] the wrong way abstain from the very
[50:47] appearance of
[50:50] evil I think this is one of those where
[50:53] as Christians it's all too easy for us
[50:54] to get wrapped up up in hey these are
[50:57] the rules as long as I follow these
[50:58] rules and don't do these things I'm
[51:04] fine we start to forget abstain from the
[51:07] appearance of evil we're going oh I'm
[51:11] fine to do
[51:12] this it's not
[51:15] wrong but how does it
[51:21] look you know we may be really good at
[51:24] holding ourselves to what God has told
[51:27] us to do and we all know that we
[51:29] struggle with that
[51:32] even but on the things that we do we go
[51:34] like hey I don't drink check I can check
[51:38] that one off the list I don't struggle
[51:40] with alcohol at all I'm
[51:45] good but have you ever ordered something
[51:48] in a restaurant that was served in a
[51:50] wine glass or was served in some sort of
[51:55] vessel that's not the normal
[51:58] cup could that
[52:01] appear like you're drinking something
[52:03] you're not supposed
[52:05] to I'm just throwing out a simple
[52:08] thought I'm not trying to condemn anyone
[52:10] on this I'll let you take your own mind
[52:13] wherever you want on this but we're
[52:15] supposed to abstain from the very
[52:18] appearance what are things that are in
[52:20] our lives that they're not
[52:23] wrong but how do they look
[52:26] how do they appearer how could people
[52:28] look at us and judge us thinking that
[52:31] maybe we're doing
[52:33] wrong could we be spoiling some of our
[52:37] testimony with something that's not
[52:39] wrong because of how it
[52:44] appears we're called to be a separated
[52:48] people in 1 Corinthians chapter 8
[52:51] starting at verse
[52:53] 9 it says but take heed lest by any
[52:56] means this Liberty of yours become a
[52:58] stumbling Bo to them that are weak for
[53:01] If any man see thee which Hast knowledge
[53:03] sit at meat in the idols Temple shall
[53:06] not the conscience of him which is weak
[53:07] be emboldened to eat those things which
[53:09] are offered to idols and through thy
[53:12] know knowledge shall the weak brother
[53:14] perish for whom Christ died but when ye
[53:18] sin so against the Brethren and wound
[53:20] their weak conscience ye sin against
[53:22] Christ wherefore if meat make my brother
[53:26] offend I will eat no flesh while the
[53:28] world standeth lest I make my brother to
[53:33] offend abstain from the very appearance
[53:36] of evil Paul was writing very clear he
[53:38] like look it's not a sin to eat this
[53:40] meat he's saying it straight up this is
[53:42] not a sin you're not going to go to hell
[53:45] because you ate this
[53:48] meat but if by doing that I hurt someone
[53:53] with weaker Faith or weaker Revelation
[53:55] or a weaker place in the body if I hurt
[53:58] them because I ate this
[54:00] meat then I am
[54:03] sinning and I there is a
[54:05] problem and so I'm going to choose to
[54:08] abstain from something that is not a
[54:12] sin to protect my brother to protect my
[54:21] sister sometimes we think that if I hold
[54:24] myself to these
[54:26] guidelines if the sisters are making
[54:28] sure that they're wearing skirts and
[54:30] loose flowing dresses and that they're
[54:33] dressing modestly and they're doing all
[54:35] these different things then I'm good
[54:38] they've checked off all the boxes
[54:40] they're doing everything that they're
[54:41] supposed
[54:43] to but is there something else going on
[54:45] in their lives and brothers we don't
[54:47] even get that as our testimony we can't
[54:49] even go out and I mean I go out like
[54:51] this and I can run into lots of guys
[54:53] that are dressed the same way as Me
[54:54] Maybe maybe not a tie right now but if I
[54:56] lose the tie I can pretty much blend in
[54:58] with most anyone up there so I don't
[55:02] even have my clothing to go here's part
[55:03] of my
[55:05] testimony but how easy it for me to go
[55:08] out and I'm doing
[55:11] something that's not a
[55:16] sin but yet it has the appearance of
[55:20] evil or it could make them question my
[55:23] testimony just a little bit
[55:29] or is it something that I'm comfortable
[55:32] with I have a revelation about that I
[55:34] know is
[55:35] safe but maybe my brother doesn't or my
[55:38] sister
[55:40] doesn't is it okay for me to do it in
[55:44] front of
[55:49] them when we really start to go into it
[55:51] the standards we're supposed to be
[55:53] living by is so much higher
[55:56] than what we will talk about even we'll
[55:59] talk about our dress we'll talk
[56:02] about not drinking not doing drugs not
[56:05] doing this not doing that we'll talk
[56:06] about all those
[56:09] things but Paul is here writing going
[56:12] abstain from the
[56:14] appearance and if you think that this
[56:16] could possibly damage the faith or make
[56:20] one of your brothers question their
[56:22] belief then don't do it
[56:28] you know we were talking about when I
[56:31] was just talking about we don't drink
[56:33] let's go into that for just a moment
[56:35] Ephesians 5 and verse 18 says and be not
[56:39] drunk with wine wear in in excess but be
[56:43] filled with the
[56:46] spirit 1 Timothy Chapter 5 and verse
[56:51] 22 lay hands suddenly on no man neither
[56:54] be part Akers of other men's sins keep
[56:57] thyself pure drink no longer water but
[57:00] use a little wine for thy stomach Sate
[57:02] and th often
[57:06] infirmities well hang on if I'm reading
[57:10] that
[57:11] verse wouldn't that mean it's okay to
[57:14] have a glass of wine now and then I mean
[57:16] Paul's instructing Timothy drink some
[57:19] wine can anyone argue that that's what
[57:22] he's saying that's he told him drink
[57:25] some
[57:26] wine okay so so so hang on this means
[57:31] that we have a Biblical reason of I
[57:33] could have a glass of wine and it would
[57:35] be okay I could do
[57:39] this and if that was the Revelation that
[57:42] I had I could go hey I can drink this
[57:45] and have no guilt and have no
[57:47] condemnation because the scripture says
[57:49] it says do not be drunken but it says
[57:51] you can have a little wine so as long as
[57:54] I'm not taking it too far it's
[57:58] okay Leviticus 10 and verse
[58:02] 8 and the Lord spake unto Aaron saying
[58:05] do not drink wine nor strong drink thou
[58:07] nor thy Sons with thee when you go into
[58:10] the Tabernacle of the congregation lest
[58:12] ye die it shall be a statute forever
[58:14] throughout your generation and that you
[58:17] may put difference between holy and
[58:19] Unholy and between unclean and clean and
[58:22] you may teach the children of Israel all
[58:24] the statutes which the Lord hath spoken
[58:26] unto them by the hand of
[58:29] Moses Judges 13 and
[58:33] verse3 and the angel of the Lord
[58:36] appeared unto the woman and said unto
[58:37] her behold now Thou Art Barren and beest
[58:40] not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a
[58:42] son now therefore beware I pray thee and
[58:45] drink not wine nor strong drink and eat
[58:48] not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt
[58:50] conceive and bear a son and no razor
[58:53] shall come on his head for the child
[58:55] shall be a Nazarite unto God from the
[58:57] womb and he shall begin to deliver
[58:59] Israel out of the hand of the
[59:02] Philistines Luke 1 and verse
[59:05] 13 but the angel said unto him fear not
[59:08] Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and
[59:11] thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[59:14] and thou shalt call his name John and
[59:16] thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[59:19] many shall rejoice at his birth for he
[59:21] shall be great in the sight of the Lord
[59:23] and shall drink neither wine wine nor
[59:25] strong drink and he shall be filled with
[59:27] the Holy Ghost even from his mother's
[59:29] womb and many of the children of Israel
[59:31] shall he turn to the Lord their God and
[59:34] he shall go before him in the spirit and
[59:36] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[59:38] father to the children and the
[59:40] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[59:42] make ready a people prepared for the
[59:47] Lord it was part of the Nazarite vow it
[59:49] was part of those that were set apart
[59:53] that were separated that they wouldn't
[59:55] drink wine or strong
[59:57] drink that they
[59:59] wouldn't partake of anything that could
[1:00:03] affect their mind that could affect
[1:00:06] their actions that could affect the way
[1:00:08] they would respond to the world around
[1:00:12] them they weren't supposed to be under
[1:00:15] any other Spirits is another way to
[1:00:17] describe it they were separated
[1:00:22] yeah now we could go back and forth and
[1:00:26] you could have all kinds of
[1:00:28] debates about well maybe it's okay to
[1:00:31] have a little wine because Paul told
[1:00:34] Timothy
[1:00:35] this and if that's your honest belief
[1:00:39] fine I don't need to convince you
[1:00:44] different abstained from the very
[1:00:46] appearance of
[1:00:49] evil I will refuse to eat meat if it
[1:00:52] could harm my brother
[1:01:00] I don't need to go any further on that
[1:01:03] we could debate alcohol all you
[1:01:07] want but if we're supposed to abstain
[1:01:09] from the
[1:01:10] appearance and if Paul was willing to
[1:01:13] stop eating just
[1:01:15] meat all of us eat meat probably
[1:01:18] multiple times a
[1:01:20] day he was willing to I will not eat
[1:01:23] meat if it could offend my
[1:01:27] brother how much more is Paul going to
[1:01:29] say I will not drink wine if it could
[1:01:33] offend my
[1:01:36] brother God called Abraham to be
[1:01:38] separated to leave what he knew and the
[1:01:41] world that was around him to be
[1:01:44] different so when God calls us and
[1:01:47] chooses us he is calling us to a
[1:01:50] separation he is calling us to
[1:01:52] separation to be set apart to be
[1:01:55] different than everything that's around
[1:01:59] us you know as I'm going into this I
[1:02:02] will apologize up front this is going to
[1:02:05] be the most meddlesome service I have
[1:02:06] ever
[1:02:08] preached so as we're continuing
[1:02:13] forward I came across this quote and it
[1:02:17] was
[1:02:19] so I got really excited when I read it
[1:02:22] because I could immediately see
[1:02:25] how people would want to pick this up
[1:02:27] and cut it off in the
[1:02:29] middle in the sermon forsaking
[1:02:35] all brother brandom says or here in
[1:02:38] Arizona rather not too many of them are
[1:02:41] wearing makeup that was fought against
[1:02:43] too well there's nothing in the Bible to
[1:02:46] say for you not to wear
[1:02:50] makeup cut walk away brother brandom
[1:02:54] said there is nothing in the Bible to
[1:02:55] say you shouldn't wear
[1:02:56] makeup there's going to be people that
[1:02:59] take this quote and they hang it up on
[1:03:01] the wall they put it on their mirror so
[1:03:03] every day when they do they do their
[1:03:04] makeup they can say I'm
[1:03:06] good brother brandom said there is
[1:03:09] nothing in the Bible to say I shouldn't
[1:03:11] wear
[1:03:12] makeup and it's it's right here he
[1:03:14] preached it in 1962 January 23rd it's
[1:03:18] paragraph 246 if there's somebody
[1:03:20] wanting this quote paragraph 246 the
[1:03:23] sermon is called for aking all it's
[1:03:25] right there it's in black and
[1:03:29] white but there's a little bit more to
[1:03:31] the
[1:03:33] quote or here in Arizona rather not too
[1:03:36] many of them are wearing makeup that was
[1:03:38] fought against too well there's nothing
[1:03:40] in the Bible to say for you not to wear
[1:03:43] makeup we just know it's wrong because
[1:03:46] it's of the
[1:03:47] world but there is a commandment in the
[1:03:50] Bible that a woman cuts her hair as a
[1:03:51] dishonorable person and it looks that
[1:03:54] way way to God and you say you got the
[1:03:56] Holy Ghost and doing so something wrong
[1:03:58] to wear a garment that pertains to a man
[1:04:00] oh sister dear don't pattern after the
[1:04:02] world forsake the world hold to Christ
[1:04:06] you say what difference does it make
[1:04:08] blessed is he that does all of his
[1:04:10] Commandments that me he might have the
[1:04:12] right to enter into the Tree of Life
[1:04:15] guilty of the least is guilty of the
[1:04:20] whole and I'm sure you all know the next
[1:04:22] quote that I'm going to go to but first
[1:04:24] 2 Kings chapter 9 and verse
[1:04:30] 30 and when J was come to jezel Jezebel
[1:04:34] heard of it and she painted her face and
[1:04:36] tired her head and looked out at a
[1:04:41] window now in the rejected King in 1960
[1:04:44] brother brand is preaching in he says
[1:04:47] one lady said to me said why do you
[1:04:49] think it's wrong for a woman to wear
[1:04:50] some of this makeup I said yes sir I do
[1:04:53] said God never if he'd have maybe wanted
[1:04:55] you to look like you was a barn he'd
[1:04:57] have made you a barn I said paint it up
[1:04:58] all like that if he' wanted you to smoke
[1:05:01] he'd put a smoke stack on top of you
[1:05:03] some flu so that you could have breathed
[1:05:05] it out but he gave you lungs to breathe
[1:05:07] good fresh air that's what he did for
[1:05:10] but they oh no they don't nobody don't
[1:05:12] want the Holy Spirit to judge them now
[1:05:14] if you get the Holy Ghost and can still
[1:05:16] live that way you come to me and tell me
[1:05:18] you got the Holy Ghost and living like
[1:05:19] that I can't be your judge but according
[1:05:22] to the word you've missed the line
[1:05:24] somewhere brother that's right that's
[1:05:25] exactly what the spirit says that's
[1:05:28] right we need back Holiness again come
[1:05:30] back to God yes they reject it certainly
[1:05:32] do they do they don't want to do it
[1:05:35] don't want to come under the
[1:05:36] jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit they
[1:05:37] don't want the spirit to guide them let
[1:05:39] me tell you something ladies I'm not
[1:05:41] making fun of you this is no place for
[1:05:42] that this is the place for judgment Goes
[1:05:45] Forth and judgment has to go right and
[1:05:48] judgments by the word of God looking
[1:05:50] there was only one woman in the entire
[1:05:52] Bible that ever painted her face that's
[1:05:53] right right one woman and she never
[1:05:56] painted her face to meet God she painted
[1:05:58] her face to meet a man to try to Vamp
[1:06:00] him J Jezebel you know what God did for
[1:06:04] her he fed her to the dogs that's right
[1:06:07] so you see a woman wearing makeup you
[1:06:08] say that's Miss dog meat that's exactly
[1:06:11] what it is for God he fed her to the
[1:06:13] dogs so that's all she stood for were
[1:06:15] dogs he fed her the dogs how many knows
[1:06:18] that's the truth say amen that's exactly
[1:06:23] right there's nothing in the Bible to
[1:06:25] say for you not to wear
[1:06:29] makeup it's wrong because it's of the
[1:06:34] world now we can pick on makeup with
[1:06:37] that quote but how many other things in
[1:06:39] our lives that we say it's
[1:06:44] okay but yet if we really step back and
[1:06:46] look at it we go you know what it's
[1:06:49] wrong because it's of the
[1:06:53] world
[1:06:55] I'm already meddling so we're going to
[1:06:56] go a little bit
[1:06:59] further and this is one it'll come as no
[1:07:01] surprise you've all heard this preached
[1:07:03] before but it stood out to me as I was
[1:07:06] going through these different
[1:07:08] thoughts we know it's wrong because it's
[1:07:10] of the
[1:07:12] world abstain from the very appearance
[1:07:15] of evil I'm going to keep saying these
[1:07:17] over and over because these are the
[1:07:18] statements I want you to have running
[1:07:20] through your head over and over and over
[1:07:22] as we go
[1:07:29] on this Christmas Eve Lord we're
[1:07:30] grateful for the gift of God for God
[1:07:32] giving to us though this be some as we
[1:07:35] believe in our hearts some Pagan
[1:07:37] Superstition of a day that they've tried
[1:07:39] to mold it and make it like a mass
[1:07:41] Christ Mass but we are not coming in
[1:07:43] that way of Santa Claus and Christmas
[1:07:45] trees and decorations but we are coming
[1:07:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus to worship
[1:07:50] the god of Heaven that was made
[1:07:51] incarnate flesh like us and dwelt among
[1:07:54] us to redeem us and suffered the
[1:07:57] reproach of the name suffered the
[1:07:58] reproach of the Cross to let a worldly
[1:08:01] institution put Emanuel to death in
[1:08:03] order he could bring us to eternal
[1:08:06] life the cruelty of sin and the penalty
[1:08:09] that it cost to rid Sin from our lives
[1:08:10] he
[1:08:11] says how I can't understand where a
[1:08:14] rabbit has anything to do with the
[1:08:15] resurrection see no sir how a Christmas
[1:08:18] tree has anything to do with the chis
[1:08:20] with the birth of Christ it's Pagan
[1:08:22] friends we've got off the path somewhere
[1:08:24] that's right but now real born again man
[1:08:27] or woman realizes because there's life
[1:08:30] within you tells you that that's wrong
[1:08:32] is that
[1:08:35] right and in why I had to be a Shepherd
[1:08:39] brother brandom says and give us the
[1:08:40] spirit the true Spirit of CH Christmas
[1:08:43] when today when Pagan ceremonies
[1:08:45] Christmas trees worshiped fiction
[1:08:47] stories of a man named Santa Claus and
[1:08:49] of our Easter rabbits and the different
[1:08:50] fashions that the commercial world is
[1:08:52] capitalized on may be laid as as side
[1:08:54] God let us enter into Christ the word
[1:08:57] for we asked it in his name and for his
[1:08:59] glory
[1:09:03] amen now I think that you could put the
[1:09:07] word Christmas tree into that quote in
[1:09:10] place of the word
[1:09:12] makeup there is nothing in the scripture
[1:09:15] to say you can't have a Christmas
[1:09:18] tree there is not just a straight
[1:09:21] scripture that goes you shouldn't have a
[1:09:23] Christmas tree you shouldn't have this
[1:09:27] great but we know we shouldn't do it
[1:09:29] because it's of the
[1:09:32] world abstain from the very appearance
[1:09:36] of
[1:09:37] evil we can get
[1:09:39] into arguments and debates with people
[1:09:42] around the message well brother brandham
[1:09:44] had a Christmas tree
[1:09:48] great this brother or sister or this
[1:09:50] pastor or this Whoever has a Christmas
[1:09:52] tree wonderful
[1:09:56] if that is their conviction I'm not
[1:09:59] going to be the one to try to convince
[1:10:00] them one way or
[1:10:01] another that's not my job or my
[1:10:07] calling that's not my
[1:10:10] role it's not my role to get onto some
[1:10:13] chat and have a great big debate over
[1:10:15] why a Christmas tree is wrong or why
[1:10:17] makeup is wrong or why insert topic is
[1:10:22] wrong
[1:10:28] but if brother brandham could look at
[1:10:30] something like makeup and he could say
[1:10:32] straight up there's nothing in the
[1:10:34] scripture to say you shouldn't wear it
[1:10:37] but we know it's wrong because it's of
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:41] world we know the scripture tells us
[1:10:43] abstain from the appearance of
[1:10:47] evil how much more should we be able to
[1:10:50] apply that to the other places of Our
[1:10:52] Lives
[1:10:54] if you're comfortable with a Christmas
[1:10:55] tree in your
[1:10:56] home
[1:10:58] wonderful good for you that's fine
[1:11:02] that's between you and God and if that's
[1:11:04] where you don't have if you don't have
[1:11:05] conviction there great enjoy
[1:11:09] it I'll be the one first first one to
[1:11:11] tell you around Christmas time my wife
[1:11:13] and I like to go out and look at all the
[1:11:15] decorations that are up around their
[1:11:17] towns can look really pretty with all
[1:11:18] the lights and everything if they
[1:11:21] decorated the same way in the middle of
[1:11:22] summer we'd go look at had it
[1:11:24] then I go when the lights are
[1:11:28] up it happens to be around Christmas but
[1:11:31] that's when we go if they put up a
[1:11:33] Christmas tree with lights and lit up
[1:11:35] the Town Square for July 4th I'd go look
[1:11:37] at it July
[1:11:43] 4th but we can get so wrapped up in
[1:11:45] these debates over well this is right or
[1:11:50] this is wrong or you know there's no
[1:11:51] scripture saying we should do this or no
[1:11:53] scripture saying we shouldn't do
[1:11:58] that but yet we start to
[1:12:02] forget that the scripture says abstain
[1:12:04] from the appearance of evil and the
[1:12:06] scripture says that Paul would avoid
[1:12:09] eating
[1:12:11] meat if he thought it could possibly
[1:12:13] offend his
[1:12:17] brother so if I think that having a
[1:12:20] Christmas tree in my home could possibly
[1:12:21] offend my brother
[1:12:25] why would I have a Christmas tree in my
[1:12:27] home even if I personally think there's
[1:12:30] nothing wrong with
[1:12:33] it we've heard brother Wendell preach on
[1:12:35] it we know where he stands it's very
[1:12:37] clear and I'm honestly leaving all those
[1:12:40] arguments off to the
[1:12:42] side because at this moment it's
[1:12:45] about what the scripture says so
[1:12:50] clearly I can stand here and I could say
[1:12:54] well I don't have a conviction about
[1:12:56] having a Christmas tree in my home
[1:13:00] wonderful but what about your brother
[1:13:02] that you're going to tempt by doing it
[1:13:05] or your sister that you're going to
[1:13:06] tempt by doing
[1:13:08] it if Paul was willing to not eat
[1:13:12] meat I'm going to skip meals because it
[1:13:16] could offend my
[1:13:19] brother then how much more should we be
[1:13:23] willing to give up some of these other
[1:13:25] things if brother brandom could look at
[1:13:28] something like makeup and say there's
[1:13:30] nowhere in the
[1:13:31] scripture that says it's wrong but we
[1:13:34] know it's wrong because it's of the
[1:13:37] world then how much more should we be
[1:13:39] looking at our own lives to go you know
[1:13:42] there's nothing in the scripture that
[1:13:43] says this is
[1:13:49] wrong but maybe I should
[1:13:52] abstain
[1:13:54] because I could be offending my brother
[1:13:56] or
[1:14:06] sister we talk all the time and I think
[1:14:09] we all understand the bar is set so
[1:14:12] high that we'll without God's grace
[1:14:15] we'll never touch it much less reach it
[1:14:18] they won't even brush our fingers upon
[1:14:21] it but yet sometimes I think even
[1:14:23] knowing it's that high sometimes in our
[1:14:25] mind we think maybe it's a little bit
[1:14:26] lower than it actually is because we go
[1:14:29] hey this is okay the Bible doesn't say
[1:14:31] this is wrong or the Bible doesn't say
[1:14:32] this is wrong or I'm not convicted I'm
[1:14:35] good to do
[1:14:36] this but yet God this is one of those
[1:14:39] where we go hey does the scripture say
[1:14:41] anything about the internet no it
[1:14:45] doesn't say the Internet by
[1:14:47] name I mentioned that on Wednesday night
[1:14:50] it doesn't talk about the internet by
[1:14:52] name
[1:14:55] great but abstain from the appearance of
[1:14:58] evil and I will abstain from things that
[1:15:02] could cause my brother to be tempted
[1:15:05] that could offend my
[1:15:07] brother if you look at life through that
[1:15:10] filter if you look through at a lot of
[1:15:11] these things through that
[1:15:13] filter and if we actually use
[1:15:18] that I think a lot of our decisions
[1:15:20] would be
[1:15:21] different and I'm preaching to myself as
[1:15:24] much as anyone I could start going
[1:15:26] through my life and cataloging going you
[1:15:27] know if I had actually been thinking
[1:15:29] through this filter I probably wouldn't
[1:15:31] have done
[1:15:33] that even though today I might still be
[1:15:37] sitting here going that's not wrong I
[1:15:38] was fine to do it but then you look at
[1:15:41] through this
[1:15:42] filter changes a little
[1:15:49] bit we get so wrapped up in trying to
[1:15:52] argue the ins and outs of the message or
[1:15:55] the ins and outs of scripture over yes
[1:15:57] but this is right or this is why I allow
[1:15:59] this or this but great shove all the
[1:16:07] debates I know I'm not
[1:16:10] interested and it's really hard for me
[1:16:12] to say that because I actually like
[1:16:14] debating it's my personality I go for
[1:16:17] that but shove all the
[1:16:22] debates through those
[1:16:24] lenses is there even still a
[1:16:32] debate in the rejected
[1:16:36] King brother brandom said God's people
[1:16:38] is never to act like the world or look
[1:16:41] like the world or be anything to do with
[1:16:44] the world you are a separated people the
[1:16:48] church a called out people A peculiar
[1:16:51] people a royal pries Ood a holy nation
[1:16:54] allog together different and set aside
[1:16:57] and all your actions and habits and ways
[1:17:01] from the things of the
[1:17:07] world when you're
[1:17:10] chosen God's first call is
[1:17:14] separation God's first call is you know
[1:17:16] the things that you used to do walk away
[1:17:20] the places you used to go walk away
[1:17:24] often the people you used to hang out
[1:17:27] out with walk away now it's not
[1:17:30] necessarily 100% of them maybe some of
[1:17:32] them were good people maybe some of them
[1:17:33] were the ones that were witnessing to
[1:17:35] you but probably 99.9% of them you walk
[1:17:39] away am you can keep the
[1:17:43] 0.1% God calls us to have separation
[1:17:47] when he chooses
[1:17:48] us because he's calling us to be in a
[1:17:51] different place he's calling us has to
[1:17:53] be a different kind of
[1:18:01] people in the era of God's
[1:18:03] Deliverance he says brother if you've
[1:18:05] ever going going to make a stand for God
[1:18:07] make it now this is the time now's the
[1:18:11] time when we need it Now's the Time when
[1:18:13] the church is weighed in the balance and
[1:18:15] found wanting after all these great
[1:18:17] Miracles and signs and wonders that God
[1:18:19] has sent men across the country doing
[1:18:21] and yet the church is the poor EST black
[1:18:24] backslid State I have ever run in years
[1:18:27] that's right I'm preaching to
[1:18:28] Pentecostals amen when I first come
[1:18:31] among your group 10 years ago it looked
[1:18:32] like a church but today it looks like
[1:18:34] the world it's the truth something
[1:18:36] happened somewhere you got to wearing
[1:18:38] better clothes got to making a little
[1:18:40] more money and it just made a sap out of
[1:18:42] you that's all that's the truth that's
[1:18:44] right you're trying to act like the rest
[1:18:46] of the world you'll see today is a
[1:18:49] compromising time that's true you paint
[1:18:51] your steps red and watch and see if your
[1:18:53] neighbor don't paint his steps red you
[1:18:55] wear a little round hat to church with a
[1:18:57] feather up on it watch all the little
[1:19:00] all the women come to church with a
[1:19:01] little round hat and a feather up it
[1:19:03] that's right all of them want to look
[1:19:04] like one another it's a matching time
[1:19:07] you know that's true it's a matching
[1:19:08] time that must have went home that's
[1:19:11] right listen this is true now I'm going
[1:19:12] to tell you brother I don't care whether
[1:19:14] my shoes match my trousers or my
[1:19:16] trousers matches my coat I want my
[1:19:19] experience to match God's Bible That's
[1:19:21] the matching time if you want to match
[1:19:23] something match your experience against
[1:19:25] Paul's amen that's what we need today is
[1:19:27] a matching time with Paul's faith in the
[1:19:29] Bible that's our example real matching
[1:19:32] time don't try to match your neighbor
[1:19:34] match some of the Saints of the Bible if
[1:19:36] you're a saint act like a saint walk
[1:19:38] like a saint dress like a saint talk
[1:19:40] like a saint pray like a saint believe
[1:19:42] like a saint shout like a saint be like
[1:19:45] a saint live like a saint die like a
[1:19:47] saint and go to heaven like a saint
[1:19:51] amen in the sermon
[1:19:55] Oneness but God's chosen ones are
[1:19:57] commanded to come out from among them be
[1:19:59] ye separated sayith God and I will
[1:20:01] receive you touch not their worldly
[1:20:03] things and I'll be the father to you or
[1:20:05] God and you'll be my sons and daughters
[1:20:07] yoke yourself not up with unbelievers
[1:20:09] but come out of it God wants separation
[1:20:12] from the world he wants to be unionized
[1:20:14] with you himself and no man-made scheme
[1:20:17] of organization denomination or any
[1:20:18] man-made theories will ever stand it'll
[1:20:21] take God the holy ghost in you to unite
[1:20:24] you to
[1:20:29] God and in a thinking man's
[1:20:33] filter it's a separated congregation
[1:20:37] it's for no one else it's only for those
[1:20:39] your chosen as the red heer's water of
[1:20:41] Separation was for the congregation of
[1:20:43] Israel only so father we know that the
[1:20:46] bread is for the Sheep
[1:20:51] only
[1:21:02] Jeremiah chap 10 veres
[1:21:07] 2-4 thus sayith the Lord learn not the
[1:21:10] way of the Heathen and be not dismayed
[1:21:13] at the signs of Heaven for the heathens
[1:21:16] are dismayed at them for the customs of
[1:21:18] the people are vain for one cutteth a
[1:21:20] tree out of the forest and the work of
[1:21:21] the hands of the work with the axe they
[1:21:24] deck it with silver and with gold they
[1:21:25] fasten it with nails and hammers that it
[1:21:27] move
[1:21:29] not now I'll admit I have used this
[1:21:31] scripture as my reason for not having a
[1:21:33] Christmas tree before because it sounds
[1:21:35] a lot like a Christmas
[1:21:37] tree
[1:21:39] but you can also take it as they were
[1:21:41] making Idols they were taking wood
[1:21:44] shaping it putting gold and silver on
[1:21:47] it whichever one it's actually that
[1:21:51] verse two right there very clear it's
[1:21:53] thus sayeth the
[1:21:55] Lord learn not the way of the
[1:22:00] Heathen you're called to be a separated
[1:22:02] people while you're here on this Earth
[1:22:05] you're called to be
[1:22:07] different don't learn the way of the
[1:22:09] Heathen while you're
[1:22:13] there abstain from the very appearance
[1:22:15] of
[1:22:19] evil and how do we know some of the
[1:22:21] things are evil
[1:22:23] because they're of the
[1:22:27] world learn not the way of the
[1:22:32] Heathen it's so easy for us to get
[1:22:35] wrapped up in the different things that
[1:22:37] are going on around
[1:22:41] usan it's like what brother Wendell's
[1:22:43] been talking about with the phones
[1:22:46] recently hey I work in a job where I
[1:22:50] need to have my email I need to have
[1:22:51] multiple different messaging apps and
[1:22:53] different things that are required for
[1:22:55] the job that I do I could not go back to
[1:22:58] a dumb phone if I wanted
[1:23:00] to because if I went back to it I
[1:23:03] couldn't do my
[1:23:05] job this is what's required I'm required
[1:23:07] to have access to the internet I'm
[1:23:09] required to be able to do different
[1:23:11] things and access different things and
[1:23:12] get different information and all these
[1:23:14] kind of things because that is my
[1:23:17] job and I will freely admit I happen to
[1:23:21] love my job
[1:23:23] I happen to love what I
[1:23:25] do but there are these restrictions that
[1:23:28] now hey I couldn't get away from the
[1:23:30] internet completely if I wanted
[1:23:33] to and unfortunately I'm not saying that
[1:23:35] I do want
[1:23:37] to but this is the point I'm living in a
[1:23:41] world that requires me to have
[1:23:44] this if I'm going to provide for my
[1:23:46] family and take for them this is what I
[1:23:48] have to
[1:23:50] have you know some of the brothers that
[1:23:52] are are business owners I'm sure there
[1:23:54] are certain things that they kind of
[1:23:56] need these phones that they can be able
[1:23:58] to access certain
[1:23:59] information they would probably have a
[1:24:01] little bit of difficulty running their
[1:24:03] businesses if they just went back to an
[1:24:06] old dumb phone that didn't have access
[1:24:07] to anything other than a phone
[1:24:10] call it would make things a little more
[1:24:13] difficult to operate a business in this
[1:24:15] day and
[1:24:17] age it would make it a little more
[1:24:19] difficult for them to even find the job
[1:24:20] they're supposed to go to
[1:24:23] I'd be willing to bet most of them use
[1:24:24] Google Maps or Apple Maps to find where
[1:24:26] they're
[1:24:29] going if they had to pull a paper map
[1:24:31] out to find it they might never make it
[1:24:33] to their
[1:24:34] job it'd be a
[1:24:38] struggle we live in a world that
[1:24:40] requires us to do certain things and so
[1:24:42] we can't look at every single thing
[1:24:43] that's out there and go this is of the
[1:24:45] world I can't touch
[1:24:47] it we are still living in the world we
[1:24:51] are still having to to conduct business
[1:24:53] we are still having to take care of
[1:24:56] different
[1:24:58] things I mean look we're looking at
[1:25:01] bringing on an app for our
[1:25:07] tithes if we're supposed to get away
[1:25:09] from the internet this kind of makes it
[1:25:11] hard
[1:25:14] now
[1:25:15] but I'll be the first one to say I pay a
[1:25:18] lot of bills
[1:25:20] online I don't I don't mail that many
[1:25:22] envelopes and checks anymore most of my
[1:25:25] bill pay is online which means I save
[1:25:27] the stamp which is great of course then
[1:25:30] I'm paying for my internet I don't know
[1:25:32] which one's the winner
[1:25:36] but but whether
[1:25:38] it's paying our bills whether
[1:25:42] it's performing our jobs whether it's
[1:25:45] doing our tithes are
[1:25:47] offering we are in a world that is
[1:25:49] requiring us to do certain certain
[1:25:54] things and so we can't simply offhand
[1:25:57] completely reject because well that's of
[1:25:59] the world I'm
[1:26:01] done I'm not suggesting that I'm not
[1:26:04] trying to say because if we reject it
[1:26:05] because it's of the world every one of
[1:26:06] us is walking home
[1:26:09] tonight CU I can't be in that
[1:26:12] car Hey Brother brandom talked multiple
[1:26:15] quotes about how many people the car
[1:26:17] kills and it's from the Tree of the
[1:26:19] knowledge of Good and Evil so if I'm
[1:26:22] rejecting the world off hand every one
[1:26:25] of us is walking
[1:26:26] home and the Cochrans and the lancasters
[1:26:29] have really long
[1:26:36] walks this is still the filter that we
[1:26:40] apply yes you're applying it with some
[1:26:42] common sense we have to drive cars to
[1:26:45] work in this Society to be able to get
[1:26:48] to the grocery store to be able to get
[1:26:50] anywhere and do anything to be able to
[1:26:52] get get to church we have to drive cars
[1:26:55] we have to have these types of phones
[1:26:57] and able to get certain things done we
[1:27:00] have to have email or we have to have
[1:27:04] whatever because this is what we have to
[1:27:07] do to Simply live
[1:27:10] here but yet I can look at it through
[1:27:13] that filter to go hey do I need every
[1:27:16] single one of these social media
[1:27:18] accounts that I could possibly
[1:27:20] get or should May maybe I filter out a
[1:27:24] few of
[1:27:26] these hey if I've got a business sure
[1:27:29] maybe I want to have a business listing
[1:27:31] on one of these because I'm trying to
[1:27:33] grow my
[1:27:34] business wonderful I don't have the
[1:27:37] slightest problem with
[1:27:38] it maybe you're using it to connect to
[1:27:41] this or connect to that or
[1:27:43] whatever there are valid reasons for
[1:27:46] some things but if I'm using this filter
[1:27:49] then maybe there are a few of these
[1:27:50] things that should be filtered out
[1:27:55] because maybe it's a little too
[1:27:56] easy to look up that girl that you used
[1:27:59] to know years and years
[1:28:01] ago or that guy You Used To Know years
[1:28:03] and years ago or look up how this old
[1:28:06] buddy is doing and maybe we can
[1:28:09] reconnect and suddenly things that God
[1:28:12] called you to separate from are starting
[1:28:15] to creep back
[1:28:16] in
[1:28:18] because we're allowing something else to
[1:28:22] regrow the
[1:28:25] connection boy I am meddling tonight I
[1:28:27] am all over the
[1:28:30] place if we take this
[1:28:33] filter abstain the very appearance of
[1:28:37] evil and I won't do anything that could
[1:28:40] offend my brother that could tempt my
[1:28:43] brother that could make them think when
[1:28:47] they have the conviction it's wrong that
[1:28:49] I could make them think it's okay and
[1:28:52] could possibly make them sin or Make
[1:28:54] Them
[1:29:01] Fall there are lots of areas in our
[1:29:03] lives we can run through this and it
[1:29:05] would take me far too long to talk about
[1:29:08] all of
[1:29:09] them but taking that time to apply it to
[1:29:12] your own life is okay what are the
[1:29:15] areas that maybe I should apply this
[1:29:17] filter to that should be
[1:29:20] gone yeah there are the things that I
[1:29:23] have to have to live and work and
[1:29:26] operate and be in this world in this
[1:29:30] Society I'm not trying to turn a
[1:29:38] Amish the sermon
[1:29:41] perseverant a Nazarite means separated
[1:29:43] to the word what a nice thing you would
[1:29:46] be tonight if all Christians would be
[1:29:47] nazarites to the Lord separated not to
[1:29:50] Creeds but to the
[1:29:52] word Christ is that word separated to
[1:29:55] the
[1:29:59] word I think it's way too
[1:30:02] easy for all of
[1:30:05] us even in the message to start to go
[1:30:09] hey this is my Creed whether it's
[1:30:11] written out or whether it's just in your
[1:30:14] heart or your mind this is my Creed so
[1:30:17] this is what I believe is okay this is
[1:30:20] the things I believe are wrong this is
[1:30:22] this this or
[1:30:25] that that's why I keep pointing back to
[1:30:28] this
[1:30:29] filter and yes I'm stomping all over my
[1:30:32] own toes tonight as
[1:30:34] well but I keep pointing back going if
[1:30:36] we're supposed to abstain from the
[1:30:38] appearance of
[1:30:39] evil how many of these things that are
[1:30:42] in our own personal
[1:30:44] Creeds may not be Church Creeds our own
[1:30:47] personal Creeds that we go this is okay
[1:30:49] for my family this is okay for me in my
[1:30:52] personal life this is okay for me
[1:30:54] whatever that that
[1:30:56] filter is going to make you cast to the
[1:31:03] side 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[1:31:06] 20 now then we are ambassadors for
[1:31:09] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[1:31:12] us we pray you in Christ dead be ye
[1:31:14] reconciled to
[1:31:17] God now the official term for the
[1:31:19] official definition for an ambassador is
[1:31:21] an credited Diplomat sent by a country
[1:31:25] as its official
[1:31:26] representative to a foreign
[1:31:35] country God chose
[1:31:37] us he chose
[1:31:40] us and basically invited us to be his
[1:31:44] Ambassador he said hey I want you
[1:31:48] brother Colby I want you and and I want
[1:31:51] you to be my
[1:31:53] Ambassador in this age of
[1:31:56] leoda I'm going to send you from my
[1:31:58] kingdom into that
[1:31:59] Kingdom and you're going to be the
[1:32:01] ambassador for
[1:32:04] me and he invited he called he asked you
[1:32:10] if you would become his
[1:32:12] Ambassador
[1:32:15] and for each one of us maybe the story
[1:32:17] is a little bit different maybe he had
[1:32:20] to ask you multiple times
[1:32:23] maybe in your life it was he asked you
[1:32:25] the first time and you immediately
[1:32:29] accepted but eventually however long or
[1:32:32] short it may have been brother kby was
[1:32:34] like yes Lord I'll be your
[1:32:37] Ambassador and then there was a ceremony
[1:32:40] to to publicly
[1:32:41] declare this is now one of my
[1:32:45] ambassadors there was a public
[1:32:47] declaration as brother Colby was
[1:32:50] baptized
[1:32:52] in front of
[1:32:53] witnesses that he was now
[1:32:57] different he was now in a different
[1:32:59] place and this ceremony was in front of
[1:33:02] however many it may have
[1:33:03] been I'm picking on him
[1:33:06] tonight but so there was a public
[1:33:08] ceremony that declared to all those that
[1:33:10] were present that this is now one of my
[1:33:13] ambassadors in the leot
[1:33:16] AG brother kby is mine I chose him I
[1:33:19] called him I invited him he accepted Ed
[1:33:22] and now this ceremony
[1:33:25] declaring and in response to his
[1:33:29] declaration to the
[1:33:32] Lord the Lord sealed him back with his
[1:33:36] own declaration I'm going to fill you
[1:33:38] with the holy
[1:33:40] spirit so Colby makes a public
[1:33:42] declaration yes I accept you Lord I will
[1:33:44] serve you I will be your
[1:33:46] Ambassador and the Lord goes yes I will
[1:33:49] now make a public Declaration of my own
[1:33:52] I will fill you I will seal you and
[1:33:55] there will now be something inside you
[1:33:57] to maintain you being set
[1:34:00] apart to teach you to instruct
[1:34:07] you if you think about it in some ways
[1:34:10] when they someone is when this ceremony
[1:34:13] if we go into the political world and
[1:34:17] someone is selected as an
[1:34:19] ambassador in some ways it's the same
[1:34:21] way as what brother brandham described
[1:34:23] when you had the ceremony of
[1:34:26] adoption and that now there's an
[1:34:28] authority that goes along with
[1:34:31] it because now I'm publicly declaring
[1:34:34] this is the ambassador to China or this
[1:34:37] is the ambassador to
[1:34:40] wherever and in that there is now an
[1:34:42] authority there they have the right to
[1:34:45] write out certain checks to sign them to
[1:34:48] do these different things they have an
[1:34:49] authority because they have have been
[1:34:51] publicly
[1:34:53] Chosen and announced this
[1:34:56] is my
[1:34:58] Ambassador oras in the ceremony of
[1:35:02] adoption this is my son his signature is
[1:35:06] just as good on the check as
[1:35:10] mine questions and answers on
[1:35:13] Hebrews an ambassador of Christ has the
[1:35:16] authority and everything that Christ
[1:35:17] owns belongs to that
[1:35:19] Ambassador and he said go ye to the all
[1:35:22] the world you are my Witnesses after the
[1:35:24] Holy Ghost has come on you and what is a
[1:35:26] witness is an ambassador is to come and
[1:35:29] witness something the whole power of
[1:35:31] Heaven is right in your
[1:35:34] hands in adoption he said and then if
[1:35:38] God has sent us to be his ambassadors
[1:35:40] all the power that's in heaven all that
[1:35:42] God is all his angels and all of his
[1:35:44] power stands behind our words if we are
[1:35:46] correctly and ordained sent Messengers
[1:35:48] to the people God has to honor the word
[1:35:51] word for he has solemnly written that
[1:35:53] whatever you bind on Earth that will I
[1:35:54] bind in heaven whatever you loose on
[1:35:56] Earth that will I loose in heaven and I
[1:35:58] give unto the the Kings to the the keys
[1:36:00] to the kingdom oh such great promise
[1:36:04] he's given the
[1:36:08] church now we know
[1:36:11] from the political world as an
[1:36:14] ambassador there's certain expectations
[1:36:17] about the way that they carry themselves
[1:36:19] about the way that they act
[1:36:22] about the way that they conduct
[1:36:26] business the Ambassador can't go and
[1:36:29] simply do whatever they think is best in
[1:36:33] that
[1:36:35] moment they have to be
[1:36:38] doing what the person that sent them
[1:36:40] thinks is
[1:36:42] best that's their job their job is to
[1:36:45] represent where they were sent from
[1:36:47] they're not there to represent their own
[1:36:49] interests they're not out out there to
[1:36:52] better themselves and get themselves to
[1:36:54] be in a better financial position or
[1:36:56] build their own
[1:36:57] wealth they are there to represent and
[1:37:00] watch out for the one that sent
[1:37:06] them when we are sent as
[1:37:10] ambassadors God is calling us to carry
[1:37:14] out his
[1:37:16] will in this
[1:37:19] age he is calling us to live in a way
[1:37:22] that represents his
[1:37:25] kingdom he is calling us to live a life
[1:37:28] that represents the kingdom of
[1:37:36] God abstain from the very appearance of
[1:37:40] evil don't damage the office you've been
[1:37:45] given don't let anyone even look at it
[1:37:47] and think that they could put a mark on
[1:37:49] your reputation
[1:37:52] because of something that you said or
[1:37:55] did that maybe it wasn't wrong but it
[1:37:58] looked a little
[1:38:01] off God's calling us to so much more
[1:38:04] than simply here's the rule book follow
[1:38:06] the rule
[1:38:08] book he's calling us to represent him in
[1:38:12] everything we
[1:38:15] do every moment that we're at work or on
[1:38:18] the job
[1:38:19] site every moment that we're in front of
[1:38:22] our children teaching them and taking
[1:38:24] care of them whether it's the moms at
[1:38:27] home whether it's the dads after we come
[1:38:31] home we have to represent talking to us
[1:38:35] men when we come home from work and
[1:38:36] we're tired and we're wore out and maybe
[1:38:39] we're a little
[1:38:41] frustrated God is still calling us to
[1:38:44] maintain a witness in front of our
[1:38:49] children just because I walked through
[1:38:51] the door at home doesn't mean I now get
[1:38:53] to vent everything out that I've been
[1:38:55] holding
[1:38:59] in because there are still some little
[1:39:01] eyes that are watching
[1:39:03] me that are going hey so how does Dad
[1:39:06] handle it
[1:39:08] when he had a bad day at
[1:39:12] work how does Mom handle
[1:39:15] it when the kids were awful all
[1:39:19] day when they got into everything when
[1:39:22] they spread the dirt throughout the
[1:39:27] house they went and they dumped soap in
[1:39:30] my cake
[1:39:36] batter how is Dad gonna act when he
[1:39:39] walks in after he's already frustrated
[1:39:42] from work and he finds a frustrated wife
[1:39:45] and kids at
[1:39:47] home is he going to be the one to come
[1:39:49] in and calm down the situ
[1:39:51] situation or is he going to toss
[1:39:54] gasoline on the fire and see just how
[1:39:55] much can
[1:40:00] burn oh I've had days where I've done
[1:40:03] both I've had plenty of days where I
[1:40:05] came home and I I dumped gasoline on the
[1:40:08] fire I made it worse I was not coming in
[1:40:12] and applying the Holy Ghost on my
[1:40:14] home but then there have been the days
[1:40:18] where I've come
[1:40:19] home
[1:40:21] and I've been able to do it
[1:40:27] right I'm not going to say which one I
[1:40:29] did more
[1:40:33] of but God is calling us to carry
[1:40:36] ourselves in a certain way to represent
[1:40:39] him in everything that we
[1:40:42] do sometimes it's easier for us to
[1:40:44] remember it when we're out on the job
[1:40:46] site because we know we're around the
[1:40:50] world
[1:40:51] we're around the people that don't
[1:40:52] believe I have to make sure that I
[1:40:54] carrying myself correctly I have to make
[1:40:56] sure that I am representing everything
[1:40:57] the way that I
[1:41:00] should and then how easy is it for us to
[1:41:02] Let It Drop at
[1:41:04] home and not continue to think wait I've
[1:41:09] got four sets of eyes soon to be five
[1:41:13] they're going to be watching me to see
[1:41:15] how dad handles it to see what my
[1:41:18] response
[1:41:19] is
[1:41:32] Galatians chapter 4 verse one it says
[1:41:35] now I say that the air as long as he is
[1:41:37] a child differeth nothing from a servant
[1:41:39] though he be Lord of all but is under
[1:41:41] tutors and governors until the time
[1:41:43] appointed of the father even so we when
[1:41:46] we were children were in the bondage
[1:41:47] under the elements of the world but when
[1:41:50] the fullness of of the time was come God
[1:41:52] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[1:41:54] under the law to redeem them that were
[1:41:56] under the law that we might receive the
[1:41:58] adoption of sons and because ye are Sons
[1:42:01] God hath sent forth the spirit of his
[1:42:03] son into your hearts crying ABA father
[1:42:07] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[1:42:09] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:42:12] through
[1:42:15] Christ and hear ye him he said and with
[1:42:19] this adoption taking place
[1:42:21] that boy's name was just as good on the
[1:42:23] check as his daddy's was everything the
[1:42:25] father had was his read the Old
[1:42:27] Testament adoption laws and find out
[1:42:29] that's right if not certainly is that
[1:42:31] son could walk down the street and this
[1:42:32] fellow wasn't doing right he could say
[1:42:34] here straighten up that meant so if he
[1:42:36] fired the man he was fired if he wrote a
[1:42:39] check and paid this off the bank will
[1:42:40] recognize the check just his name was
[1:42:43] just as good as his father's after he'd
[1:42:44] been adopted not because he was born
[1:42:47] because he was adopted or placed
[1:42:54] God has placed us into this position of
[1:42:58] authority
[1:43:00] and brother brandom talked about it when
[1:43:04] this boy was under the
[1:43:07] tutors the father was listening to the
[1:43:10] reports because he was waiting to hear
[1:43:12] enough good reports and hear that the
[1:43:15] boy had the kind of character that
[1:43:16] needed to be before he would adopt him
[1:43:20] it was wasn't he was just waiting yeah
[1:43:21] when he turns 16 we're going to adopt
[1:43:23] him it's all
[1:43:24] good he was looking for a certain
[1:43:27] character he was looking for something
[1:43:29] that he could say yes I can trust this
[1:43:32] to my
[1:43:33] son I can trust my son to represent me
[1:43:37] when he goes
[1:43:39] out and it's the same way when you look
[1:43:41] at it from the standpoint of someone
[1:43:44] being the
[1:43:45] uh Ambassador and going
[1:43:49] out they're going to do interviews
[1:43:52] they're going to go through a selection
[1:43:53] process because they're trying to find
[1:43:55] somebody that will represent them to the
[1:43:58] best of their
[1:44:00] ability now nowadays it's probably more
[1:44:02] about political did this guy give enough
[1:44:04] funds to my campaign did he do this did
[1:44:06] he do that great you're going to
[1:44:08] represent me but the way it's meant to
[1:44:11] be is could I trust this person to
[1:44:16] represent the interests that I
[1:44:18] have to get done what I want to have
[1:44:21] done to represent what I feel is the
[1:44:23] best
[1:44:25] decision while
[1:44:27] he's thousands of miles
[1:44:34] away and God
[1:44:37] looked down through
[1:44:40] time and he looked at the age of leoa
[1:44:43] and he looked at everything that was
[1:44:45] going to be going around all the
[1:44:46] Temptations all the struggles all the
[1:44:48] problems that would be faced
[1:44:53] and he went you know
[1:44:55] what brother Ken that's that's who I
[1:44:59] want in that
[1:45:00] age brother Joe that's going to be one
[1:45:02] of my
[1:45:04] ambassadors brother Caleb
[1:45:07] Martin I want him
[1:45:10] there put your name in God looked down
[1:45:13] through
[1:45:14] time looked at the age the worst age
[1:45:19] that could be
[1:45:22] and he said this is the
[1:45:25] one that I trust to represent my
[1:45:31] interests in that
[1:45:33] Kingdom this is the one I trust to live
[1:45:36] out my desires and my commands in that
[1:45:44] Kingdom God looked
[1:45:47] down and he was not
[1:45:51] slovenly about choosing who would be the
[1:45:55] best he didn't just throw the names in a
[1:45:58] hat draw and go oh yeah this guy will be
[1:45:59] there and this guy will be
[1:46:01] there but he looked down and he went
[1:46:04] there's a
[1:46:07] character in this brother and in this
[1:46:13] sister and he went and he said sister
[1:46:17] Carol I'm choosing you to be born in
[1:46:21] that native tribe and to be my
[1:46:25] Ambassador in that
[1:46:28] world to a people that they might not
[1:46:30] want to
[1:46:33] hear what I would
[1:46:40] say look I'll be the first one to tell
[1:46:42] you I'm as white as they get I do not
[1:46:44] even really tan
[1:46:46] well I go to burn and back to pale it's
[1:46:49] what I do
[1:46:53] God didn't choose me to put me in that
[1:46:57] spot but God looked and said sister
[1:47:01] Carol brother
[1:47:04] Donald those are going to be my
[1:47:07] ambassadors brother Mike
[1:47:09] King that's one of my
[1:47:12] ambassadors and they can go and they
[1:47:15] will be able to stand and they will be
[1:47:17] able to witness and they will be able to
[1:47:18] carry themselves in a manner that others
[1:47:21] will look at them and go there's
[1:47:23] something
[1:47:24] different in how they carry themselves
[1:47:27] in the things that they say and the
[1:47:29] things that they
[1:47:30] do and I can trust them to act in my
[1:47:35] best
[1:47:36] interests in
[1:47:39] leoda I can trust them to act in that
[1:47:43] area of
[1:47:45] leoda I can trust brother William to act
[1:47:48] in this area I can trust brother Ken to
[1:47:50] be here and brother kby to be here and
[1:47:53] brother uh Jonah and pick put your
[1:47:57] name and the same thing with every
[1:48:00] sister I will trust
[1:48:04] you with the most
[1:48:07] precious I'm going to trust you to raise
[1:48:10] those little
[1:48:14] ones not just I'm going to trust you to
[1:48:16] work in the world and be around them and
[1:48:19] maybe be a w is I'm going to trust you
[1:48:21] to teach them from
[1:48:23] birth about
[1:48:26] me I'm going to trust you to teach them
[1:48:29] about the Lord from the moment that you
[1:48:31] start singing Sunday school songs to
[1:48:34] them to help them go to
[1:48:40] sleep because that's the position I've
[1:48:43] given
[1:48:44] you not only are you an ambassador to
[1:48:47] the world you are also the teacher
[1:48:51] of the most precious things coming
[1:48:55] up God doesn't give any of us like Duty
[1:48:58] as
[1:48:59] ambassadors he doesn't send any of us to
[1:49:03] the
[1:49:05] uh to put it in a political world none
[1:49:08] of us are getting sent to England none
[1:49:11] of us get to go sit in an allies nation
[1:49:13] that we speak the same language that we
[1:49:15] do this that we do
[1:49:17] that we are all getting sent to the
[1:49:20] country that is on the front
[1:49:22] lines we're all getting sent to the
[1:49:24] country where we are surrounded by
[1:49:25] pretty
[1:49:26] much enemies all
[1:49:29] around not the people but the
[1:49:35] spirits we are ambassadors in a time of
[1:49:38] War we don't get the easy assignments we
[1:49:42] don't get placed in an easy place but
[1:49:45] yet at the same
[1:49:47] time we have a king that looked on us
[1:49:49] and went I can trust you because of the
[1:49:53] character that's on the inside to
[1:49:55] represent my
[1:49:57] interests in Le
[1:50:00] oia and because I can trust you to do
[1:50:02] that I can also trust you with this
[1:50:05] Authority that when you sign the check
[1:50:08] it's just as
[1:50:17] good in the sermon choosing of a
[1:50:23] bride it was
[1:50:30] interesting when I first started getting
[1:50:32] interested in looking into the idea of
[1:50:35] being
[1:50:36] chosen that was where it started I was
[1:50:38] just focusing on being
[1:50:39] Chosen and I was going through that and
[1:50:41] so obviously choosing of a bride this is
[1:50:44] a great sermon to go through I ended up
[1:50:46] getting very few quotes from it but
[1:50:49] there was one quote that stood out as I
[1:50:51] was going
[1:50:55] through brother Ram's talking in the
[1:50:57] choosing of a bride he says phone PA
[1:51:00] phone call just come in a little while
[1:51:02] ago this morning a member of my church
[1:51:05] which is really a Baptist woman out of
[1:51:07] Louisville she died early this morning
[1:51:10] and my church at home a real group of
[1:51:13] consecrated men assembled themselves
[1:51:16] together and went down before the
[1:51:18] Undertaker and balmed her stood over her
[1:51:21] prayed until life came back in her and
[1:51:23] she is living tonight the Elders of my
[1:51:26] church why they've been taught to
[1:51:28] believe that all things are possible
[1:51:30] come to God
[1:51:35] sincerely brother brandom didn't testify
[1:51:37] of hey I went and prayed for this woman
[1:51:39] and she came back to
[1:51:41] life sure he had plenty of those
[1:51:44] testimonies but he went and said hey I'm
[1:51:47] not even
[1:51:48] there I'm out out of state preaching a
[1:51:51] sermon over
[1:51:53] here I forget where this sermon was
[1:51:55] preached but he's off wherever
[1:51:57] ministering and he says so this sister
[1:52:01] dies and so a group of consecrated men
[1:52:05] from my church that know the word of
[1:52:08] God that know they have the
[1:52:12] authority they went and they
[1:52:16] prayed and God answered and she's living
[1:52:19] tonight
[1:52:20] amen it didn't take a prophet to go to
[1:52:23] it it didn't take
[1:52:26] some amazing Minister that travels the
[1:52:29] world or this that or the other it took
[1:52:31] a group of consecrated Believers that
[1:52:34] went hey we have the authority because
[1:52:36] we have the word amen and so our prayer
[1:52:40] is just as
[1:52:42] effective because it's the same word
[1:52:44] whether we're praying it or whether the
[1:52:46] prophet's praying
[1:52:48] it we're we're sent as ambassadors we
[1:52:51] have that same Authority now I know I'm
[1:52:56] not going to do the number of Miracles
[1:52:58] that happened in brother brandom's
[1:52:59] Ministries because I don't have that
[1:53:02] call but that doesn't mean that there
[1:53:05] can't be a miracle that happens when I
[1:53:07] pray come on that doesn't mean there
[1:53:10] can't be a miracle that happens when my
[1:53:12] wife
[1:53:14] prays it doesn't mean there can't be a
[1:53:16] miracle when one of my children pray
[1:53:20] that's
[1:53:22] right God didn't put an age cut off
[1:53:25] saying you have to be at Le least this
[1:53:27] old before I
[1:53:28] respond God didn't put a gender cut off
[1:53:32] God didn't put H this that or the
[1:53:35] other God looked and said Do You
[1:53:39] Believe do you have
[1:53:41] faith do you have faith in my word and
[1:53:45] can you apply the
[1:53:48] word that's that's
[1:53:53] it we're called to be ambassadors we're
[1:53:56] called to be set
[1:53:58] apart we were chosen and then the next
[1:54:01] step God called
[1:54:05] separation and separated is more than
[1:54:07] just following a rule
[1:54:09] book separated is in the very way that
[1:54:12] we look at the world it's the very way
[1:54:14] that we respond to the
[1:54:16] world it's not just following a
[1:54:19] checklist of okay I got to make sure I
[1:54:20] check these off every day that I didn't
[1:54:22] do any of them as long as I didn't do
[1:54:24] these I'm good as long as I did these
[1:54:27] I'm
[1:54:29] good it's the way that we look at things
[1:54:32] it's the way that we respond to
[1:54:34] things it's us looking and going hey I'm
[1:54:37] not out for my own desires or my own
[1:54:41] Comfort my own development my own wealth
[1:54:44] my own
[1:54:45] whatever I'm here on the father's
[1:54:48] business
[1:54:50] my job in leoda is to represent
[1:54:56] him and yes part of my role is to go to
[1:54:59] work and provide for my family that's
[1:55:01] part of the things he called me to
[1:55:06] do but he called me in all those moments
[1:55:10] to be representing him to be living for
[1:55:12] him and so this isn't about us trying to
[1:55:15] argue for why this is okay or that is
[1:55:20] okay arguing about hey this is why it's
[1:55:23] okay to have a Christmas tree or hey
[1:55:25] this is why it's okay to have a French
[1:55:28] manicure or this is why it's okay to do
[1:55:31] this or do that or I don't care put in
[1:55:34] what you
[1:55:36] want that's not my purpose for being on
[1:55:39] Earth my purpose is not to debate why
[1:55:42] I'm right and you're wrong or why this
[1:55:44] person's wrong and we're both right or
[1:55:46] whatever my purpose is to represent
[1:55:50] Christ and represent his interests here
[1:55:53] on
[1:55:55] Earth that's what each one of us is
[1:55:58] called to do we're not called to get
[1:55:59] drawn into some big debate or some big
[1:56:03] whatever at least I'm not maybe God gave
[1:56:06] you that
[1:56:08] office I'll let you figure that out
[1:56:10] yourself but I'm not called to go into
[1:56:12] that now I'll be the first one to say
[1:56:15] brother Wendell as a pastor is called to
[1:56:16] get into it at least a little
[1:56:18] bit that's his role I'm not a pastor so
[1:56:22] I'm not called to get into the debates
[1:56:24] like that that's not my
[1:56:29] role but each one of us and that's
[1:56:32] brother Wendell included are called to
[1:56:34] represent Christ in everything that we
[1:56:36] do we are called to act out in the
[1:56:39] interests of Christ in everything that
[1:56:42] we do
[1:56:44] that's we are called to live for him we
[1:56:47] are called to live a life
[1:56:50] that anyone that looks at us would
[1:56:53] go that's a
[1:56:56] Christian we are called to live a life
[1:56:59] that is above
[1:57:01] reproach we are called to abstain from
[1:57:04] the very appearance of
[1:57:08] evil I don't know how you can make the
[1:57:10] calling any
[1:57:12] higher it's not abstained from Evil it's
[1:57:14] the very appearance this is what we're
[1:57:17] called
[1:57:18] to so that means I can take my checklist
[1:57:21] and throw it out the
[1:57:23] window because it's not just abstained
[1:57:26] from
[1:57:30] Evil it's the appearance we are supposed
[1:57:34] to live a life so high so close to God
[1:57:39] so directly on every word that was
[1:57:45] spoken God went and chose a bride that
[1:57:48] would think his thoughts
[1:57:50] thoughts that wouldn't be acting in her
[1:57:52] own interest but her every
[1:57:55] response would be the heart of Christ
[1:57:59] because the holy spirit is indwelling
[1:58:01] her the holy spirit is guiding her and
[1:58:04] the Holy Spirit is
[1:58:11] Christ I don't know how to try to make
[1:58:14] this more
[1:58:15] plain hopefully I'm making it clear
[1:58:17] enough that even the kids can get this
[1:58:19] part that this is what we're called
[1:58:23] for yes I will love talking to people
[1:58:26] about okay what did God call you to do
[1:58:28] in a career because God placed callings
[1:58:31] on every one of our lives he made
[1:58:34] brother merel to work for the post
[1:58:37] office that was his calling that's the
[1:58:39] only way he lasted there as many years
[1:58:41] as he
[1:58:43] did he did not call me to be in the post
[1:58:47] office brother Merl has shared a few of
[1:58:49] his stories and I was like I would have
[1:58:51] been fired or I would have quit it
[1:58:53] wouldn't have
[1:58:55] happened I also know that not everyone
[1:58:58] is called to work at
[1:59:00] Chick-fil-A not everyone is called to be
[1:59:03] an
[1:59:03] electrician not everyone is called to
[1:59:06] work in Social
[1:59:08] Services or Plumbing or remodeling or
[1:59:13] whatever your career is put it
[1:59:16] in but yet and so
[1:59:19] I work with a lot of young people and I
[1:59:22] enjoy having those conversations with
[1:59:23] them to go
[1:59:24] okay so what are the things in your life
[1:59:27] that you would go this is what God is
[1:59:29] calling me to and designing me
[1:59:36] for it's not just about finding a career
[1:59:38] where I make a lot of money it's going
[1:59:40] this is where God wants me to
[1:59:43] be and I enjoy that
[1:59:48] conversation but but at the same
[1:59:51] time for every one of
[1:59:53] us that claims to be a Christian we have
[1:59:56] a purpose so much higher than our
[2:00:00] career we have something so much more
[2:00:04] than running our own business or doing
[2:00:06] this or doing
[2:00:07] that yes God called you to do this to
[2:00:10] provide for your family and pay the
[2:00:12] bills and meet the needs
[2:00:15] wonderful but he called you to be his
[2:00:18] representative he called you to
[2:00:20] represent his
[2:00:22] Desires in the most evil
[2:00:26] age when the whole world is going
[2:00:29] crazy he called you to be
[2:00:32] there as a beacon of
[2:00:37] sanity and pointing people to the way to
[2:00:40] have
[2:00:47] sanity it's so much more than than just
[2:00:50] our career it's so much more than even
[2:00:53] just being and I hate you calling it
[2:00:55] just being but than just being a father
[2:00:58] or a
[2:00:59] mother he's calling us so much more than
[2:01:04] that you could be a father or mother and
[2:01:07] make sure the kids' needs are met
[2:01:08] they're fed they're watered they have a
[2:01:10] bed to sleep
[2:01:12] in I'm going to educate them and then
[2:01:15] I'm going to send them off to the world
[2:01:16] which will devour them like a pack of
[2:01:18] lions
[2:01:19] or a pack of
[2:01:22] wolves I would still be a father or my
[2:01:26] wife would be a mother if that's what we
[2:01:29] did but God's calling us to so much more
[2:01:32] than that God's calling us to go to a
[2:01:35] have a bar set that is so much
[2:01:38] higher because we are his ambassadors
[2:01:42] representing his desires on
[2:01:46] earth in every single thing that we
[2:01:59] do and the possession that the promise
[2:02:02] that was given to the church is not a
[2:02:03] natural land but a spiritual land for we
[2:02:06] are a royal
[2:02:07] priesthood a holy nation then in this
[2:02:10] royal priesthood holy nation peculiar
[2:02:12] people called out elected chosen set
[2:02:14] aside then all the world is dead on the
[2:02:16] outside and we are led by the Spirit
[2:02:20] Sons and Daughters of God are led by the
[2:02:22] spirit of God not by man but by the
[2:02:26] spirit Revelations 17 and verse1
[2:02:31] 14 these shall make war with the lamb
[2:02:34] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[2:02:36] is the Lord of lords and the king of
[2:02:38] kings and they that are with him are
[2:02:41] called they that are with him are
[2:02:44] called and
[2:02:46] chosen and faithful
[2:02:52] that's
[2:02:54] you they are called they are chosen they
[2:02:58] are
[2:02:59] faithful and God looked at each one of
[2:03:01] you said they're called they're chosen
[2:03:04] they're faithful they're going in
[2:03:08] leoda because they can handle that
[2:03:11] that's the character that I'm looking
[2:03:14] for Ephesians chapter 1 and
[2:03:17] verse4 according as he hath chosen Us in
[2:03:20] him before the foundation of the world
[2:03:23] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[2:03:25] before him in
[2:03:28] love as the musicians
[2:03:47] come
[2:03:51] in the church age
[2:03:53] book in the suban church age he says and
[2:03:57] this is a little bit of a lengthy quote
[2:03:58] as we're wrapping
[2:04:01] up now it says that he hath chosen Us in
[2:04:04] him Jesus before the foundation of the
[2:04:08] world that means that we were right
[2:04:10] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[2:04:13] of God before the foundation of the
[2:04:15] world that gives an eternal quality to
[2:04:18] the elect
[2:04:19] you can't get away from that let me
[2:04:22] inject a thought in here even our
[2:04:25] natural birth is based upon
[2:04:26] election the female ovaries produce many
[2:04:29] many eggs but why is it that a certain
[2:04:32] time at a certain egg comes down and not
[2:04:34] another one and then amongst the male
[2:04:36] sperm for no reason a certain germ
[2:04:38] attaches itself to the egg While others
[2:04:41] that could have just as easily attached
[2:04:42] themselves or had better opportunity to
[2:04:44] do so did not do so and
[2:04:47] perished there is an intelligence behind
[2:04:50] in all this otherwise what determines
[2:04:53] whether the baby is a boy or girl blonde
[2:04:55] or brunette light or dark type of eyes
[2:04:58] Etc with these thoughts in mind think
[2:05:00] about Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say
[2:05:04] in John 649 your fathers did eat Mana in
[2:05:07] the wilderness and are
[2:05:08] dead those parents that died were
[2:05:10] necessary as the forefathers of the
[2:05:12] people to whom Jesus was speaking they
[2:05:15] perished yet they were in the election
[2:05:16] of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb
[2:05:19] were
[2:05:20] spiritually but to go on those elect
[2:05:23] were not only the Eternal thoughts of
[2:05:24] God which were to be expressed in flesh
[2:05:27] in their due season but these same elect
[2:05:29] are called by another
[2:05:31] name Romans 4:16 therefore it is of
[2:05:34] faith that it might be by grace to the
[2:05:37] end the promise might be sure to all the
[2:05:39] seed not to that only which is of the
[2:05:42] law but to that also which is of the
[2:05:44] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[2:05:47] all r Romans 9:
[2:05:50] 7-13 neither because they are the Seed
[2:05:53] of Abraham are they all children but in
[2:05:55] Isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[2:05:58] they which are the children of Flesh
[2:06:00] these are not the children of God but
[2:06:02] the children of the promise are counted
[2:06:04] for the seed for This Is The Word of
[2:06:06] Promise at this time will I come and
[2:06:08] Sarah shall have a son and not only this
[2:06:11] but when Rebecca had also conceived by
[2:06:14] one even by Our Father Isaac for the
[2:06:16] children being not yet born neither
[2:06:18] having done any good or evil that the
[2:06:20] purpose of God according to election
[2:06:22] might stand not of works but of him that
[2:06:25] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[2:06:28] Shall Serve the
[2:06:29] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[2:06:32] loved but Esau have I
[2:06:34] hated Galatians 3:16 now to Abraham and
[2:06:37] his Seed where the promises
[2:06:39] made he saith not and to seeds as of
[2:06:43] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[2:06:46] is
[2:06:47] christor Galatians 3:29 if you be Christ
[2:06:50] then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs
[2:06:52] according to the promise according to
[2:06:54] Romans 4:16 we find that God had given a
[2:06:57] sure promise to all of Abraham's seed
[2:07:00] and Paul puts himself and all believers
[2:07:02] under that designation because he says
[2:07:04] Abraham who is the father of us
[2:07:07] all then he goes on not to only narrow
[2:07:09] down his definition but rather to
[2:07:11] finalize it for in Galatians 3 he
[2:07:14] identified the seed singular with Jesus
[2:07:17] and counted the seed children as
[2:07:19] children of promise and promise is
[2:07:21] having to do with election or the
[2:07:23] choosing of
[2:07:24] God and that is exactly what we have
[2:07:26] been
[2:07:27] saying those who are of the royal seed
[2:07:30] are the elect of God are the
[2:07:32] predestinated forn of God and were in
[2:07:35] the mind of God and His Thoughts in very
[2:07:38] plain language the true bride of Christ
[2:07:40] was in the mind of God eternally though
[2:07:43] not expressed until each came forth in
[2:07:45] the designated decreed season as each
[2:07:48] member came forth it became expressed
[2:07:51] and took its place in the body thus this
[2:07:54] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[2:07:59] bride and though she is feminine in
[2:08:01] designation she is also called the body
[2:08:03] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[2:08:06] ought to be called that for she was
[2:08:08] predestinated in him came from the same
[2:08:11] Source was eternal with him and is now
[2:08:14] manifesting God in a many membered body
[2:08:17] whereas once God was manifested in one
[2:08:19] member even our Lord Jesus
[2:08:22] Christ now then here we are coming to a
[2:08:25] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[2:08:27] made manifest in the Sun and in Jesus
[2:08:30] dwelt all the fullness of the godhead
[2:08:32] bodily and that Eternal one was the
[2:08:34] father manifest in flesh and thereby
[2:08:36] gained the title of son even so we
[2:08:40] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[2:08:42] became the many membered spoken word
[2:08:44] seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal
[2:08:47] thoughts now man manifest in flesh are
[2:08:49] the sons of
[2:08:51] God even as we are
[2:08:54] soall we did not become seed by the
[2:08:57] rebirth we were seed and therefore were
[2:09:01] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[2:09:04] because we were seed is the reason we
[2:09:06] could be quickened in nonseed there is
[2:09:09] nothing to
[2:09:13] Quicken God didn't choose
[2:09:16] lightly he looked down
[2:09:19] and he
[2:09:21] chose because it was his seed already in
[2:09:24] us he chose because we had been with him
[2:09:29] from the
[2:09:30] beginning we he chose because we were in
[2:09:33] the mind of God from the beginning he
[2:09:35] chose because we were there with
[2:09:41] him he wasn't randomly looking down at
[2:09:43] Leo de and going yeah I think that one
[2:09:45] will work and I think that one will work
[2:09:46] and I think that one will work
[2:09:50] it was before there was
[2:09:52] anything before he had spoken a word of
[2:09:56] creation God already in his mind was
[2:09:59] going there's going to be a brother
[2:10:02] James Torrance in Le
