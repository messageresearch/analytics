[35:37] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[35:40] eye shall see him and they also which
[35:43] pierced him and all kindreds of the
[35:45] Earth shall well because of him even so
[35:48] amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[35:52] and the end saith the Lord which is
[35:55] which was which is to come the Almighty
[35:58] I John who also am your brother and
[36:02] companion and tribulation and in the
[36:04] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[36:07] in The Isle that is called Patmos for
[36:10] the word of God for the testimony of
[36:12] Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the
[36:15] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[36:17] voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha
[36:21] and Omega the first and the last uh and
[36:26] and what thou seest write in a book and
[36:28] send it into the seven churches which
[36:30] are in Asia and Ephesus Smyrna pergamus
[36:34] thotara Sardis Philadelphia and laodicea
[36:39] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[36:41] with me and being interned I saw seven
[36:44] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[36:46] the candlesticks one like unto the son
[36:48] of man clothed with a garment down to
[36:50] the foot and gird about the paps with
[36:52] the golden girdle his head and his hairs
[36:55] were white like wool as white as snow
[36:58] his eyes were as flames of fire his feet
[37:02] like undefined brass and they burned in
[37:05] a in a furnace as if they burned in a
[37:07] furnace and his voice is the sound of
[37:08] many Waters he had in his right hand
[37:11] Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a
[37:14] sharp two-edged sword and his
[37:16] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[37:19] his strength and when I saw him I fell
[37:21] dead at his feet and he laid his right
[37:24] hand upon me saying unto me fear not I
[37:28] am the first and the last I am he that
[37:32] liveth and was dead and behold I Am
[37:35] Alive forevermore amen and have the keys
[37:38] of hell

[38:58] we were sure glad to see them back home
[39:01] here this evening praise the lord well
[39:03] so
[39:04] um we're we're still on this mysterious
[39:06] one in the candlesticks and um
[39:10] um it's important I I wanted to just
[39:13] take take the time as we have
[39:17] um as we've been going through
[39:20] um
[39:21] this this seven-fold uh personage of
[39:25] Christ brother Branham says amen that
[39:28] this these first couple chapters are
[39:31] really
[39:33] um it's it is it is God
[39:36] expressing the deity of Jesus Christ
[39:38] Jesus is showing that that he is not the
[39:43] second person of the godhead that he is
[39:46] not the third person but he is the God
[39:49] God has glorified the body of Jesus
[39:54] Christ amen and amen they're they're in
[39:58] Acts 2 and 36 and and I'll wait for for
[40:02] you to find it in your Bibles
[40:04] um Acts 2 and 36
[40:08] we we find that
[40:11] um that that God has made Jesus
[40:16] both Lord and Christ
[40:20] amen they're in Acts 2 and 36 and when
[40:25] you get there you can say Amen
[40:27] amen
[40:29] um
[40:30] we um
[40:33] and we'll read there now it says
[40:35] therefore let all the house of Israel
[40:37] know assuredly that God hath made that
[40:42] same Jesus whom you have crucified both
[40:46] Lord and Christ
[40:49] amen so both Lord and Christ I want us
[40:54] just to look real quickly let's go to
[40:55] Matthew 28.
[40:57] and 18 uh while we while we're here
[41:02] in man
[41:03] um this is Jesus talking as he is fixing
[41:06] to leave
[41:07] and Matthew 28 and and 18
[41:12] he he tells them
[41:15] amen and Jesus came and spake unto them
[41:17] saying all power is given unto me now he
[41:23] has resurrected so now he is he is
[41:25] declaring to to his disciples all power
[41:31] in Heaven and Earth has been given unto
[41:34] me
[41:35] so so what does that mean what what does
[41:37] that mean to you kids what what would
[41:39] that mean when all power another place
[41:41] he said in Heaven and Earth is giving
[41:43] none to me amen that that that that
[41:46] means all of God is living in that
[41:51] glorified body
[41:53] amen now they're in the book of
[41:54] Philippians the Bible says he was
[41:56] exalted and said at the right hand of
[41:59] God and was given far above all
[42:01] principalities Powers dominions and and
[42:04] and and uh he was given a name that is
[42:07] above every name so all of God is now in
[42:13] Jesus Christ
[42:14] y'all understand that
[42:16] in the 19th verse
[42:18] it says go ye therefore teach All
[42:21] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[42:24] the father of the son and of the Holy
[42:28] Ghost teaching them to observe all
[42:30] things where whatsoever I have commanded
[42:32] you lo I am with your way even unto the
[42:36] end of the world now so now we've got
[42:38] the trinitarians that are trying to uh
[42:42] say there are three Gods now now Jesus
[42:45] has just declared all power in Heaven
[42:48] and Earth has been given unto me
[42:52] now then he turns right around to the
[42:55] next scripture and says go baptize in
[42:58] the name of the father Son and Holy
[43:01] Ghost now if all power is put in Jesus
[43:06] would Jesus turn around and say Amen but
[43:10] there's three equal ones in heaven that
[43:13] have power there's no three equal people
[43:15] in Heaven Nor God's in heaven that has
[43:18] power Jesus is the only one
[43:22] that has power
[43:24] now now this is this is important
[43:27] because when you go to
[43:30] um after he tells them to baptize in the
[43:32] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost if
[43:34] you go to Acts 2 and and a 38
[43:39] amen and we can turn there too
[43:43] praise the Lord
[43:46] it's good to see brother John tonight
[43:48] amen we don't always get to see him on
[43:51] Wednesday nights
[43:52] praise the Lord
[43:54] it says then Peter said unto them repent
[44:00] and be baptized every one of you in the
[44:03] name of the father
[44:05] Son and Holy Ghost
[44:08] is that what he said
[44:10] no
[44:11] repent be baptized every one of you in
[44:15] the name of what
[44:17] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[44:21] man so so you've got amen so you've got
[44:25] the invisible God
[44:35] amen there you've got the invisible God
[44:37] that that fills all spaces all times all
[44:41] places then you say Amen he's invisible
[44:44] right
[44:45] amen just just to prove a point let's go
[44:48] to First Timothy uh one let's let's look
[44:51] here at First Timothy one
[44:54] because I think I think this is a
[44:57] we've got to have scripture for what we
[44:59] believe Hallelujah
[45:01] so if we go to First Timothy 1 and I
[45:04] believe it is it is the 17th chapter
[45:09] I just dropped my lid on that
[45:13] praise the Lord
[45:17] yeah yeah uh First Timothy 1 and 17.
[45:22] now
[45:24] are y'all there
[45:26] man hey give these kids a hand clap
[45:29] these kids are just awesome
[45:33] now unto the king
[45:35] eternal
[45:37] immortal
[45:39] invisible
[45:41] the only wise God Amen so if there's
[45:46] three of them we've only got one wise
[45:47] one all right but there's only one wise
[45:51] God and he is eternal
[45:54] he is Immortal he is invisible
[45:59] the honor and Glory forever and ever can
[46:02] you say Amen so we've got the invisible
[46:05] God
[46:07] that is going to be manifested in three
[46:12] amen he's going to be manifested so I'm
[46:16] going to put I'm going to put this right
[46:18] here father
[46:22] man
[46:24] then we'll have Sun
[46:27] and then we'll have Holy Ghost
[46:34] amen now it is this is the invisible God
[46:39] being manifested or being declared a man
[46:44] being
[46:45] um uh uh the the great God over us
[46:51] which was
[46:52] Lord
[46:54] in the Old Testament he was called
[46:56] Jehovah
[47:02] he was called lord
[47:05] he was called Almighty
[47:10] amen this is this is this is this is
[47:13] that God that led Israel it was God
[47:16] above above us amen but now that God is
[47:22] looking for he's he's building a body so
[47:27] that he can become material
[47:30] Among Us amen he is he is now now the
[47:34] remember the scripture says here a
[47:36] Deuteronomy you can just write this down
[47:39] for those that are taking notes
[47:40] Deuteronomy 6 and 4 hear o Israel the
[47:42] Lord our God is one Lord Jesus said
[47:46] there in Mark 12 and 29 the first of all
[47:49] the Commandments is hear o Israel the
[47:51] Lord our God is one Lord can you say
[47:55] Amen now now the scripture says that now
[47:59] they're now then there's God revealed in
[48:02] the Sun and and if you would look there
[48:05] in first Timothy
[48:07] um I believe it's first Timothy 2 and 5.
[48:11] yes First Timothy 2 and 5.
[48:14] there is one mediator or one God
[48:18] one mediator between God and Men the man
[48:23] Christ Jesus so now God has is moving
[48:28] and living in a flesh he's living in a
[48:31] fleshly body
[48:34] praise the Lord amen I'm getting
[48:36] somewhere
[48:37] so now it is God it was God expressing
[48:41] himself Amen in in three offices it is
[48:46] God the invisible God over Israel
[48:50] now it's God living in the people can
[48:54] you say Amen now
[48:57] when God wanted to express himself in
[49:00] the Old Testament amen he actually
[49:02] revealed himself through the logos which
[49:05] was that great Pillar of Fire now so
[49:09] when you look at God at the beginning
[49:11] if I could if I could put it uh in in
[49:15] that way if you if you were to look at
[49:18] in in the beginning the invisible God
[49:21] and then brother Branham says when God
[49:23] spoke then out of God came amen the
[49:27] invisible God came a physical form or or
[49:30] a a tangible form which was the logos
[49:33] God would forevermore live in that
[49:37] Pillar of Fire that's the reason why you
[49:39] seen the pillar of fire we don't have
[49:41] one in here uh the pillar of fire over
[49:43] brother branham's head that's the reason
[49:45] why when he would appear to Moses and
[49:47] the burning bush I mean man it was it
[49:49] was God in the fire amen sitting in the
[49:53] bush that was talking to Moses it was
[49:55] God Mountain on fire and God spoke out
[49:57] of the the Fire on the Mountain to the
[50:00] people amen it's it it was it was it was
[50:03] a tangible form of God and that's
[50:06] actually what he revealed himself to
[50:09] over the people as the fatherhood amen
[50:12] he would come in that Pillar of Fire on
[50:16] in in the uh to that Old Testament
[50:19] Church he appeared in the pillar of fire
[50:21] uh to in in uh in in
[50:26] um Elijah amen it was the great Pillar
[50:29] of Fire and it was God in a tangible
[50:33] form can you say Amen now no beginning
[50:37] of days no ending of days it is the
[50:39] great God now when Jesus comes it is now
[50:43] God made flesh let's look here let's
[50:46] look here in uh there in Saint John the
[50:50] first chapter
[50:52] we all know it
[50:54] amen Saint John 1 and 1.
[51:00] praise the Lord
[51:06] Matthew Mark Luke John
[51:09] and John 1 whoa
[51:13] amen
[51:15] praise the Lord
[51:17] Saint John 1. it's in the New Testament
[51:24] some of you old ones are I was thinking
[51:26] man I'm glad you said that because I
[51:28] couldn't find John amen
[51:34] Hallelujah now
[51:36] so Saint John 1 1 in the beginning
[51:40] was the word amen was the logos
[51:46] the word or the logos was with God and
[51:51] the Word was God so the pillar of fire
[51:54] was God's form that God lived in amen so
[52:00] now you have the invisible God the
[52:02] invisible then when he spoke then he
[52:06] become a Halo God is now living inside
[52:10] that light this is it right here God is
[52:14] living that Halo that is over brother
[52:16] branham's head that is God
[52:19] that that is God living in that Halo
[52:24] amen now now do I I I put some
[52:27] scriptures down here amen because
[52:30] um they're they're in Hebrews 12 and 29
[52:33] and you can just write it down Amen in
[52:36] your notes for our God is a consuming
[52:39] fire amen and we just went through some
[52:42] of these others when when uh when God
[52:45] made Covenant with Abraham remember that
[52:47] he put him to sleep there in in Genesis
[52:50] the 15th chapter 8 through 17 and when
[52:54] he put him to sleep and and and and and
[52:56] uh after Abraham had had sacrificed all
[53:01] of the animals then God puts him to
[53:03] sleep and then the Bible says a burning
[53:05] lamp went in between all of the
[53:08] sacrifices as God made a covenant with
[53:12] him when Ezekiel seen God he saw that
[53:15] whirling Pillar of Fire but when Ezekiel
[53:19] saw him he saw he saw uh uh uh it amen
[53:24] uh God in a man amen he saw he saw the
[53:28] pillar of fire that was that was coming
[53:31] within a man being molded within a man
[53:34] so there was a man he said there was a
[53:36] fire going up there was a fire going
[53:38] down amen so it was God showing that he
[53:43] wanted to become human amen are you
[53:46] hearing me now I want us I want you to
[53:49] catch this as we as we are going because
[53:52] amen the great uh and and a few let's go
[53:56] back to Saint John for a moment you know
[53:57] we we read that there in the beginning
[53:59] was the word the word was with God the
[54:01] Word was God and then you go down to the
[54:03] 14th verse and the Word was made Flash
[54:09] so the great logos of God Amen come and
[54:14] lived within the body of Jesus Christ
[54:19] amen now now I this is this is because
[54:23] he's a redeemer God wanted to redeem he
[54:28] wanted to bring all of you children he
[54:31] wanted to bring all the mamas and
[54:33] daddies he wanted to bring everyone back
[54:36] to himself and the only way he could do
[54:39] this was to become a human
[54:42] can you say Amen so now does that make
[54:45] us two Gods no it's the invisible God
[54:48] within the pillar of Fire
[54:51] it's the pillar of fire that is now in
[54:54] the sun in the beginning was the word
[54:56] the word was with God the Word was God
[54:58] the word was made flesh is that right
[55:02] now that body but now this this body of
[55:06] Jesus it was sick
[55:09] it could it could uh it Jesus had
[55:12] headaches Jesus had everything just like
[55:15] you and I had
[55:16] Jesus could not
[55:19] he says could not do anything unless God
[55:23] told him to do it amen he couldn't he
[55:25] couldn't he couldn't heal the sick
[55:27] unless God told him to do it he could
[55:30] not pray for the sick unless God told
[55:32] him to do it Jesus was subject to that
[55:36] Pillar of Fire that lived on the inside
[55:39] of him
[55:40] Jesus prayed and said if it when he
[55:43] didn't even want to go to the cross
[55:44] Jesus was saying listen I know you're
[55:48] wanting me to go to the Cross but I'm
[55:51] asking if there is any way possible
[55:54] let this pass from me
[55:57] I don't want to die Jesus didn't want to
[56:00] die as a human
[56:04] but he was subject unto God
[56:08] man why because this perfect son was
[56:13] going to pay the price for every one of
[56:15] you
[56:16] and it was that perfect son and the
[56:19] cross that was going to enable the great
[56:22] Pillar of Fire to move on the inside of
[56:25] you
[56:26] and live through you
[56:28] can you say Amen
[56:29] do you all understand that so that's the
[56:31] reason why amen there is one God
[56:36] one mediator
[56:38] the man Christ Jesus amen there in
[56:42] second Corinthians 5 and 19.
[56:45] let's look here at that real quick
[56:46] before we move on into their our lesson
[56:49] for tonight
[56:51] second Corinthians
[56:55] now any and if you got questions and I I
[56:57] just want I um I wanted to go over this
[57:01] just take her time and make sure you
[57:04] kids are getting it anyone else want to
[57:06] add anything remember on these Wednesday
[57:07] nights you're welcome to talk amen
[57:11] second Corinthians 5 and 19.
[57:16] to wit that Christ
[57:19] or that God was in Christ
[57:25] reconciling the world to himself
[57:30] by uh uh let's see to himself
[57:35] not imputing their trespasses and hath
[57:37] given unto us the ministry of
[57:38] reconciliation can you say Amen now if
[57:41] the 18th verse says all things are of
[57:44] God who hath reconciled us to himself by
[57:48] Jesus Christ so God looking for a remedy
[57:51] there was only one way as we've already
[57:53] been going through it there's always
[57:55] there's only one remedy and that is to
[57:59] satisfy the the uh the the the
[58:02] dissatisfied the righteousness of God
[58:04] and the Judgment of God somebody had to
[58:08] die for our sins and whoever died had to
[58:12] had to be perfect because if he was a
[58:15] sinner then he would have to die for his
[58:17] own sins and the only way that we could
[58:21] be saved was for a perfect man
[58:25] to step forward and say I will die in
[58:29] the place of Luke
[58:31] Luke is guilty but I am not so I can go
[58:35] and righteously I can die for him take
[58:39] his sins upon me and then Luke can be
[58:41] free
[58:43] Hallelujah that's the way it was with
[58:46] all of us that was God in Jesus
[58:50] reconciling the world to himself
[58:53] amen now
[58:56] so we we we're thankful for that now the
[59:00] Holy Ghost amen well the Holy Ghost is
[59:03] the same thing as as as the the Holy
[59:06] Ghost is is the Messiah amen
[59:10] the Holy Ghost is is the anointing
[59:16] amen
[59:18] the Holy Ghost is it would be the pillar
[59:21] of Fire
[59:28] so we find out the Holy Ghost is the
[59:32] same thing as the father as we have did
[59:33] as we have shown to you over and over
[59:36] again amen Mary shall conceive of the
[59:40] Holy Ghost Mary shall conceive of the
[59:43] Holy Ghost which was the father of Jesus
[59:46] Christ can you say Amen now now that
[59:51] light now remember
[59:52] that same light came on the day of
[59:55] Pentecost that great Pillar of Fire amen
[59:59] this great Pillar of Fire that was here
[1:00:02] the tangible part of God now here we
[1:00:05] have the invisible God God created the
[1:00:08] pillar of fire lived inside that Pillar
[1:00:11] of Fire revealed himself throughout the
[1:00:14] entire Old Testament through that light
[1:00:17] that's the way he died but in the light
[1:00:20] he could not redeem he could not die he
[1:00:23] could not save so God then builds a body
[1:00:26] Jesus moves on the inside of Jesus to
[1:00:30] come and pay your penalty so now there's
[1:00:34] no sin held against any of us
[1:00:39] he took it
[1:00:41] no one can go to hell because Jesus died
[1:00:46] and went to hell for you
[1:00:49] know there's a lot of people that's died
[1:00:51] and there's a lot of people that went to
[1:00:53] hell but God then raised Jesus up from
[1:00:57] the grave to declare that your sacrifice
[1:01:01] has been accepted
[1:01:03] all right any questions
[1:01:06] any questions right right now
[1:01:09] Hallelujah
[1:01:11] all right so now what's the Holy Ghost
[1:01:13] Got to Do with It now that you are now
[1:01:16] that you are clean
[1:01:18] now that there's no sin held against you
[1:01:23] praise the Lord
[1:01:26] isn't it wonderful to know that now okay
[1:01:29] but just because you've been forgiven
[1:01:31] you've still got you have still got the
[1:01:34] desire to sin
[1:01:38] you can say Jesus forgive me for lying
[1:01:40] for telling a lie amen
[1:01:43] and you're forgiven
[1:01:44] but then the next day if you're a liar
[1:01:48] you're going to lie again
[1:01:50] I could die for Luke
[1:01:54] but that don't mean that tomorrow he
[1:01:56] ain't going to do the same thing again
[1:02:01] praise the Lord
[1:02:02] so what God does he comes and washed us
[1:02:06] with his blood now he has Groove all the
[1:02:10] Devils out of us he has cleansed us up
[1:02:12] Hallelujah he's taken the cup amen he
[1:02:16] has washed it with his detergent and now
[1:02:19] the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire that
[1:02:23] lived in the body of Jesus can now come
[1:02:26] in and live in you
[1:02:30] now it's God's holy life
[1:02:33] living through you it takes away it
[1:02:36] takes away all the powers of sin in your
[1:02:39] life yes you're still walking in a muddy
[1:02:41] world you still get mud on your feet you
[1:02:44] still get mud on your clothes amen but
[1:02:47] you see you're you're not a pig a pig
[1:02:50] wants to live inside the mud in the pig
[1:02:53] pen
[1:02:54] the Pig loves mud and and no matter what
[1:02:59] you do how much you clean it up it still
[1:03:01] loves mud and there's too many people
[1:03:03] amen while we're here there's too many
[1:03:05] people that get all cleaned up with the
[1:03:08] blood of Jesus and then they go right
[1:03:09] back out there again and they're getting
[1:03:12] all and they love it they just they just
[1:03:14] go dive like a pig right back in the mud
[1:03:17] they go back out and they keep smoking
[1:03:19] they keep drinking they keep doing those
[1:03:21] things because by Nature they are
[1:03:24] sinners Jesus does not want to just shed
[1:03:28] his blood to forgive Jesus wants to
[1:03:32] change the nature so that we can come
[1:03:35] back into fellowship with God again
[1:03:40] man it's not good enough just to be
[1:03:43] forgiven we want God's spirit God's life
[1:03:45] living through us
[1:03:48] amen any questions
[1:03:51] amen anything you want to add brother
[1:03:53] brother William
[1:04:28] sure yeah that was that was Jehovah
[1:04:30] living in that body
[1:04:33] yes it was a sinless body
[1:04:36] that's right that's that's exactly right
[1:04:39] but in but but Jesus fulfilled all of
[1:04:44] the Old Testament types and as a high
[1:04:47] priest then he was he was not going to
[1:04:50] be able to come into service until he
[1:04:52] was at the age of 30 years old and he
[1:04:54] would have to have as a lamb he would
[1:04:57] have to be washed
[1:04:58] and then he would have to be anointed
[1:05:01] for service
[1:05:03] amen so he didn't enter in his ministry
[1:05:05] until 30 years old
[1:05:07] but he was that brother Branham says
[1:05:09] that was Jehovah God laying in that
[1:05:12] Manger
[1:05:15] it was God that ate and slept it was God
[1:05:18] that that that done those things amen so
[1:05:21] so you're you're exactly right and but
[1:05:23] but the but but the anointing that the
[1:05:26] dove that came in and God saying this is
[1:05:28] my beloved Son hear ye him the man he
[1:05:31] was fulfilling the law uh all he was

[1:09:31] longer
[1:09:32] a lamb he is no longer a high priest he
[1:09:37] has moved his his role now not as the
[1:09:41] intercessor but now he is stepping into
[1:09:45] the role of Judge
[1:09:49] same God
[1:09:51] amen now remember we already went
[1:09:54] through all the scriptures there is only
[1:09:55] there is no other savior that beside me
[1:09:58] I am the only savior is that right then
[1:10:02] he comes in the body of Jesus Christ as
[1:10:04] your savior now he's going to step
[1:10:07] forward as a judge
[1:10:10] and you'll notice now the the mercy is
[1:10:14] over but God is still living in a body
[1:10:17] hello

[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:43] you remember
[1:10:44] any of you adults
[1:10:48] yeah and represented wisdom yeah
[1:10:52] it represented the judge now now
[1:10:55] remember judges dating back way back to
[1:10:58] the 16th century amen uh they they would
[1:11:01] uh back into the 1600s they they wore
[1:11:05] white wigs
[1:11:07] and uh and and many nations still wear
[1:11:11] white wigs today amen the judge would
[1:11:14] come in in a white whip this this
[1:11:17] represented impartiality amen he you
[1:11:21] know he he
[1:11:22] represented the law and it distinguished
[1:11:26] him from anyone else in in in the in the
[1:11:30] audience he was there as a judge he he
[1:11:34] respected no person amen he was sworn to
[1:11:37] be uh non-biased he was or or prejudiced
[1:11:41] his decisions are to be based solely
[1:11:45] upon the law amen though he'd be a
[1:11:48] common man the judge is a common man
[1:11:50] just like you he might be your best
[1:11:52] friend you might play golf with him you
[1:11:55] might deer hunt with him you you you
[1:11:57] might he might be your father he might
[1:12:00] be your brother but when he steps in as
[1:12:03] judge and puts the wig on he is not
[1:12:06] going to he is he is not going to
[1:12:09] respect your person because you're his
[1:12:11] friend he's not going to respect your
[1:12:14] person because uh you're a brother he is
[1:12:17] now judged and he is one thing to do to
[1:12:21] respect the law
[1:12:24] when he puts the judge your hat on
[1:12:28] if you're guilty
[1:12:31] you'll be condemned
[1:12:34] amen now now it's incredible because the
[1:12:38] scripture shows they're they're in in
[1:12:40] Revelations the first chapter it says he
[1:12:43] comes with he comes with uh with clouds
[1:12:46] of glory and all I shall see him brother
[1:12:49] random says that's not when he when when
[1:12:51] we go up to meet him that's when he
[1:12:53] comes as the world leader and all eyes
[1:12:56] will see him all eyes will stand there
[1:12:58] amen there on the Judgment Day he comes
[1:13:01] in the clouds and all of the earth will
[1:13:05] see him amen
[1:13:07] and he'll have this white judge this
[1:13:10] white hat on Amen remember we just read
[1:13:12] that back in in uh uh in Daniel where
[1:13:17] the scripture says and I'll just read it
[1:13:19] to you uh we I we we all read it the
[1:13:22] other night
[1:13:23] but it but it says um
[1:13:26] let's see uh seven and nine I be held
[1:13:31] till the Thrones were cast down and the
[1:13:33] Ancient of Days did set whose garment
[1:13:37] was white as snow and the hair of his
[1:13:41] head was like pure wool now he's talking
[1:13:44] about the Ancient of Days
[1:13:47] amen this is this is the lordship this
[1:13:50] is the Father the Jehovah the Lord the
[1:13:53] Almighty this is amen this this is that
[1:13:56] God is he's letting him see a figure of
[1:13:58] him his throne was like a fiery flame
[1:14:02] his wheels as a burning fire that will
[1:14:05] that the pillar of fire and a fiery
[1:14:07] stream issued forth from before him and
[1:14:09] thousands thousands ministered unto him
[1:14:12] brother Branham says that's you and I
[1:14:14] we've already been caught up in the
[1:14:16] rapture
[1:14:17] now we've come back he is going to be
[1:14:19] the real the the the world judge the
[1:14:23] white Throne judgment is set amen and
[1:14:26] and and ten thousand uh times uh ten
[1:14:29] thousand stood before him the Judgment
[1:14:31] was set and the books were open and I
[1:14:34] beheld them because the voice of the
[1:14:35] great words which the horns spake and I
[1:14:37] beheld till the Beast was slain and his
[1:14:39] body destroyed and came and given to the
[1:14:42] Burning Flame and concerning the rest of
[1:14:44] the Beast they had their Dominion taken
[1:14:46] away yet their lives were put on for a
[1:14:48] season in time and I saw in the night
[1:14:51] visions behold one like the son of man
[1:14:54] coming with the clouds of heaven and
[1:14:57] came to the Ancient of Days and they
[1:14:59] brought him and uh brought him near
[1:15:02] before him and there was given him
[1:15:04] Dominion Glory Kingdom that all the
[1:15:07] people Nations languages should serve
[1:15:10] him his Dominion is an everlasting
[1:15:12] Dominion which shall not pass away his
[1:15:15] kingdom which shall not not be destroyed
[1:15:18] now here we are again we're talking
[1:15:20] here's the Ancient of Days here's the
[1:15:22] son of man
[1:15:25] all right
[1:15:26] but now are there two gods
[1:15:29] or is there one
[1:15:31] so if we've already declared and the
[1:15:33] Apostle Paul and the Apostle Peter and
[1:15:34] all of the Old Testament all declared as
[1:15:36] only one God
[1:15:37] then we've got to understand this is God
[1:15:40] showing wait a minute this is God
[1:15:43] showing what he's doing through the body
[1:15:46] of Jesus Christ
[1:15:50] praise the Lord
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:54] okay
[1:15:55] now
[1:15:57] so we have this old board here we've
[1:16:00] I've had this long time actually I used
[1:16:02] that magic eraser on this the other day
[1:16:05] and so it took all of that pretty film
[1:16:07] off of it amen
[1:16:10] it had I couldn't get the words off the
[1:16:12] other
[1:16:13] so now here here he is standing now
[1:16:16] y'all don't be laughing at me Hallelujah
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:26] amen so so here is this
[1:16:29] here's this wigged one here
[1:16:33] here's here's this wig one
[1:16:39] all right
[1:16:43] praise the Lord
[1:16:45] now he when we see him well he looks he
[1:16:48] he looks he looks pathetic
[1:16:53] okay
[1:16:55] now he's got the white wig one the son
[1:16:58] of man Jesus Christ has the white wig on
[1:17:05] now in the Book of Daniel it shows that
[1:17:09] the invisible one
[1:17:12] had the wig on
[1:17:14] but when we look there in the book of of
[1:17:17] of uh
[1:17:19] uh the Revelation it says that the son
[1:17:22] of man Jesus had the wig on
[1:17:25] it is God in the body of Jesus Christ he
[1:17:32] is now the judge
[1:17:35] now the girdle was once is is around the
[1:17:39] waist
[1:17:40] amen it holds the the the ephod on Amen
[1:17:43] so the ephod would come and hang down
[1:17:45] below His Garment or as down low and
[1:17:49] then this this girdle was put here to
[1:17:52] hold on the Priestly robes because and
[1:17:56] it also it was it was thick enough to to
[1:17:59] where they could pick up the lambs and
[1:18:01] it was it would protect it would protect
[1:18:03] their back as and that's the priest
[1:18:06] always wore that that girdle but now in
[1:18:09] this one the girdle is missing
[1:18:13] and now it is wrapped around his
[1:18:16] shoulders now it is wrapped around amen
[1:18:20] his his chest area he is now a judge
[1:18:26] he's now got uh I mean that's that's a
[1:18:30] pathetic looking amen
[1:18:32] Hallelujah he now has
[1:18:36] a wig
[1:18:38] on is that better that's even worse amen
[1:18:42] amen so he's wearing the wig just like
[1:18:46] the old judges did amen and he's
[1:18:49] standing there
[1:18:51] it is the great Eternal one
[1:18:54] coming as the judge to punish those who
[1:18:58] have rejected
[1:18:59] can you say Amen so now listen we want
[1:19:02] him while he's still got Mercy we want
[1:19:07] him while he is still amen God uh while
[1:19:11] his blood is still there now what was
[1:19:13] the next thing we seen the other night
[1:19:14] Flames his eyes were his flames of fire
[1:19:17] now think of it his eyes were once
[1:19:20] dimmed with tears he cried as they beat
[1:19:24] him he cried as he looked over Jerusalem
[1:19:27] and said Jerusalem Jerusalem he cried at
[1:19:30] Lazarus grave Jesus wept amen as as they
[1:19:36] as they whipped him and humiliated him
[1:19:38] he looked at him through eyes of
[1:19:40] compassion and said father
[1:19:42] forgive them
[1:19:45] but on that day there will not be a tear
[1:19:48] on that day it'll be flaming fire
[1:19:53] amen he's going to be judged can you say
[1:19:57] Amen now
[1:19:59] so tonight let's look uh for for a few
[1:20:01] moments
[1:20:03] at his feet like under brass
[1:20:06] amen now why would his feet be like
[1:20:08] brass
[1:20:10] anyone anyone have a guess
[1:20:12] amen why would his feet be like brass
[1:20:16] judgment
[1:20:18] brass represents judgment so write that
[1:20:21] down in your books or in on your papers
[1:20:24] brass represents judgment
[1:20:27] amen now now when we think about brass
[1:20:31] uh the Bible says his feet was like
[1:20:35] undefined brass as if they burned in a
[1:20:39] furnace
[1:20:40] amen so now brass is well known for its
[1:20:43] hardness
[1:20:44] and and and brother Branham would say
[1:20:46] now this brass has stood the test of the
[1:20:49] fire
[1:20:50] a test that no other has gone through
[1:20:54] the brass
[1:20:56] signifies Divine judgment
[1:20:59] now does does anybody any anybody in the
[1:21:03] Old Testament can can anyone name where
[1:21:05] brass was used in the Old Testament and
[1:21:07] I'm just only I'm only just going to go
[1:21:09] through this uh through breast tonight
[1:21:12] huh
[1:21:14] yes Brazen Starbucks so we'll use that
[1:21:16] for a moment so the Brazen serpent how
[1:21:19] many remembers why the Brazen serpent
[1:21:22] was was was built
[1:21:24] any of you kids know why have y'all
[1:21:25] learned that
[1:21:27] why was there a Brazen why did God tell
[1:21:29] Moses
[1:21:31] to make a Brazen serpent
[1:21:47] ER
[1:21:48] that's exactly right so that that's
[1:21:51] right they had rebelled against God they
[1:21:54] were sinful they they rebelled against
[1:21:56] Moses and so fiery serpents had came out
[1:21:59] and was killing thousands of them
[1:22:01] thousands of them were dying Moses come
[1:22:04] to God to that Pillar of Fire that's
[1:22:08] that's that's the word of God he always
[1:22:10] when Moses would come and and visit that
[1:22:13] Pillar of Fire and he would tell them
[1:22:15] amen now now there was no Bloodshed
[1:22:18] Jesus wasn't born yet so there was no
[1:22:21] forgiveness of sins so what God done is
[1:22:25] God gave a a fig pre-figure of what
[1:22:29] Christ would do he said he said make a
[1:22:33] snake of brass now why would he say
[1:22:36] snake
[1:22:38] anyone anyone why would he make a snake
[1:22:42] with brass
[1:22:44] Hallelujah
[1:22:48] let me send judged but but why wouldn't
[1:22:50] it why why would why would it why a
[1:22:52] snake
[1:22:57] well now on the surface you would think
[1:23:00] that it would just uh uh because it's
[1:23:02] getting bit by snakes but no that's not
[1:23:04] the reason
[1:23:09] because sin came through the serpent
[1:23:14] sin came through the serpent so God said
[1:23:17] I want you to build a serpent made of
[1:23:21] brass
[1:23:22] which would mean sin
[1:23:25] judged
[1:23:27] praise the Lord
[1:23:29] and they would take this Serpent and he
[1:23:31] says I want you to lift it up really
[1:23:33] high
[1:23:34] so that everyone that's looks they will
[1:23:38] live anyone that looked at this Brazen
[1:23:41] serpent The Serpent of brass they would
[1:23:44] they would they might be dying just
[1:23:46] fixing to die and as soon as they looked
[1:23:48] at that snake they were totally healed
[1:23:52] praise the Lord
[1:23:54] sin was judged
[1:23:56] what's another place what's another
[1:23:57] thing in in the Old Testament that God
[1:23:59] used brass on
[1:24:02] man
[1:24:03] the Brazen altar so when God was going
[1:24:06] to put a a uh when in in the Tabernacle
[1:24:10] Amen to come and see God God showed
[1:24:14] three compartments and so
[1:24:17] that was a beautiful Masterpiece I hate
[1:24:19] to erase it amen
[1:24:22] so we had
[1:24:29] so these were the outer courts this is
[1:24:31] when this is where they would bring in
[1:24:33] and in order to come to God you had you
[1:24:37] had a Brazen you you had a a Brazen
[1:24:40] altar
[1:24:42] that you would have to come
[1:24:44] and you would slay the lamb now first of
[1:24:47] all you would you'd have to wash the
[1:24:48] Lamb with the brazenol uh labor then you
[1:24:52] would have to come in after the lamb has
[1:24:53] been washed and purified then the lamb
[1:24:56] would be slain now I want to I want us
[1:24:59] to think because there's there's there's
[1:25:01] three compartments this here is this
[1:25:03] here would be the blood of Jesus this is
[1:25:06] justification
[1:25:09] praise the Lord ah Wendell
[1:25:20] then sanctification
[1:25:26] and this here was the holy of holies
[1:25:28] which represented the Holy Ghost
[1:25:33] so you would have to come in with the
[1:25:36] blood of the Lamb right here
[1:25:40] you'd have to go in through the with the
[1:25:41] blood of the Lamb they would slay it
[1:25:43] right here in here you would have as
[1:25:46] you're coming into here you would have
[1:25:47] the Brazen the Brazen labor this is
[1:25:50] where you looked in the washing of the
[1:25:51] Water by the word as you come into here
[1:25:55] amen this in here is where the Holy
[1:25:57] Ghost is at this is where God dwelt this
[1:25:59] is where this Pillar of Fire lived okay
[1:26:01] now now I I without without getting too
[1:26:05] too much into that before you could come
[1:26:07] to God God always used brass
[1:26:13] and he always slayed a lamb
[1:26:16] to judge sin
[1:26:19] you kids understand that it represented
[1:26:22] so that Brazen serpent that was lifted
[1:26:25] up that was a type of Jesus
[1:26:28] now Jesus wasn't sin
[1:26:31] Jesus became sin
[1:26:35] Jesus became your sin your sin yours
[1:26:40] yours yours yours yours yours he became
[1:26:44] all of our sin
[1:26:46] and they put him on the cross
[1:26:51] so that his men in the Bible said Jesus
[1:26:53] says if I be lifted up I will draw all
[1:26:57] men unto me
[1:26:59] those that will look to Jesus can be
[1:27:02] saved
[1:27:04] what does it take to be saved
[1:27:06] a real repentant heart and believing
[1:27:08] that Jesus died for you the righteous
[1:27:13] God took on a body and died for you
[1:27:19] he become your sin Luke he become your
[1:27:23] sin he took all of your sin on him so
[1:27:27] that all of his righteousness can come
[1:27:30] back on you
[1:27:32] so how many is repented of their sins
[1:27:34] Hallelujah then you are just as
[1:27:37] righteous as God is did you know the
[1:27:40] Bible says that
[1:27:42] somebody says well if I could just be
[1:27:43] like God you are you're just as
[1:27:46] righteous as God is when your sins have
[1:27:50] come into judgment Jesus Paid the price
[1:27:54] for you
[1:27:57] now what all did those guys have to do
[1:27:58] with that Brazen serpent all they had to
[1:28:01] do is to now there was a lot of them
[1:28:04] that weren't going to look because they
[1:28:05] were rebellious
[1:28:06] they were rebellious and they weren't
[1:28:08] the reason the snakes come is because
[1:28:10] they're rebelling against God's Prophet
[1:28:12] rebelling against God's word so when the
[1:28:15] prophet comes in and says here's the
[1:28:17] serpent look and live thousands of them
[1:28:20] said we ain't doing it
[1:28:22] but as many as would look
[1:28:26] they were healed that's all they had to
[1:28:28] do was to look and live
[1:28:32] Jesus if when we want to come into
[1:28:35] before God all we have to do is come
[1:28:39] with our sacrifice Jesus has already
[1:28:42] died Jesus has already paid the price
[1:28:45] for that everyone
[1:28:48] amen
[1:28:49] you say okay now what else do I have to
[1:28:51] do brother Wendell do I have to have do
[1:28:54] I have to
[1:28:55] believe in Jesus Plus
[1:28:58] do good works
[1:29:01] no no
[1:29:03] do I okay so so in order to be saved
[1:29:05] brother Wendell I have I have to believe
[1:29:07] in Jesus I have to believe in the
[1:29:10] sacrifice plus girls wear long hair then
[1:29:14] I can be saved right
[1:29:16] no no no
[1:29:18] you have to look to Jesus alone
[1:29:22] there's no good works that you can do to
[1:29:27] Merit salvation you must look to Jesus
[1:29:31] alone it's not what Jesus done plus what
[1:29:34] you've done no no it's believing what
[1:29:39] Christ has already paid for you
[1:29:45] Hallelujah you say that's too simple
[1:29:48] go ahead
[1:30:05] well it was judgment yes yes his sins
[1:30:10] had had came in and there was a
[1:30:12] significance to that he was under the
[1:30:15] Judgment of God and the Philistines had
[1:30:18] now come in and and had had bound him up
[1:30:21] and and that's exactly right
[1:30:25] but he was the elect
[1:30:27] so the elect is calling out to God even
[1:30:30] in their in their in their in their sins
[1:30:33] brother Brandon preached that message a
[1:30:34] couple times just once more
[1:30:37] and God heard his request God heard his
[1:30:40] cry can you say Amen now now do you all
[1:30:43] understand that you're saved not by
[1:30:45] works but you're saved by the blood of
[1:30:47] Jesus Christ
[1:30:49] amen now some of you you kids have any
[1:30:51] questions
[1:30:54] the adults have any questions
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:58] so you're saved by the blood of Jesus
[1:31:01] Christ
[1:31:02] now you say it now if then we're saved
[1:31:04] by the blood of Jesus Christ then why do
[1:31:06] we come to church every Wednesday and
[1:31:07] every Sunday and why do we
[1:31:10] why do we wear our dresses and our long
[1:31:13] hair and why do we do those kinds of
[1:31:17] things then if we I mean
[1:31:19] then the rest of the church world must
[1:31:21] be right the must the rest of the church
[1:31:23] world they're right they're saying all I
[1:31:26] have to do is believe in Jesus and then
[1:31:28] it don't matter I can be a homosexual I
[1:31:31] can be I can be uh a lesbian I can be uh
[1:31:36] transgender
[1:31:40] no no why did the blood come
[1:31:44] because God had his children that wanted
[1:31:48] to do right but they couldn't because
[1:31:51] they were Bound by sin
[1:31:54] they were Bound by sin we wanted to do
[1:31:57] right God's children wants to do right
[1:32:02] God didn't save us say I'm going to shed
[1:32:05] my blood now you had better do this and
[1:32:06] this and this and this and this no no
[1:32:08] it's our it's it's something about that
[1:32:11] seed of God on the inside of you but you
[1:32:13] were never free to do it it's like a
[1:32:16] seed in the ground amen you got the
[1:32:18] seeds in the ground it's under the
[1:32:19] ground as long as there's no daylight
[1:32:22] that seed will never grow but when
[1:32:25] sunlight comes Hallelujah then the seed
[1:32:29] germinates and begins to rise toward the
[1:32:31] Sun and then before you know it you've
[1:32:33] got a flower here
[1:32:34] it's because there is always in the seed
[1:32:38] but it never could grow because of the
[1:32:40] darkness
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:43] now here come God God come and washed us
[1:32:47] scrubbed us
[1:32:49] right
[1:32:51] so that his holy spirit can come and
[1:32:53] live on the inside of us now it's the
[1:32:56] holy God living in US
[1:32:59] aren't y'all thankful for that
[1:33:01] that's why we've got to have the Holy
[1:33:03] Ghost is that the Holy Spirit can live
[1:33:06] his life
[1:33:07] in me you couldn't do it as long as
[1:33:10] you're a sinner you couldn't do it but
[1:33:12] when Jesus came paid the price
[1:33:16] God couldn't even look at you y'all know
[1:33:17] that God would not even look at you
[1:33:21] until Jesus come to bridge the gap God's
[1:33:24] holy your sinner God's up here you're
[1:33:27] down here there was no it's sort of like
[1:33:29] it's sort of like the Republicans and
[1:33:31] Democrats there ain't no meeting in the
[1:33:33] middle amen but then Jesus came and took
[1:33:36] you a sinner and took the hand of a holy
[1:33:38] God
[1:33:39] and through his body he brought you and
[1:33:42] God right back together

[1:34:45] sometimes you kids don't want to go to
[1:34:47] the shower amen especially the girls
[1:34:49] boys you know we're always clean but
[1:34:53] so
[1:34:55] there was a joke amen
[1:34:57] so Jesus was made flesh Jesus took our
[1:35:01] Jesus Took the Judgment of God all of
[1:35:06] God's Wrath was poured out on Jesus are
[1:35:09] y'all hearing me
[1:35:11] amen you kids understand him
[1:35:13] all of God's Wrath was poured out on
[1:35:16] Jesus
[1:35:17] all this all the sin was paid for
[1:35:21] through him
[1:35:23] amen now here was the deal
[1:35:26] here's here's here's the deal
[1:35:29] Satan knew God's law
[1:35:32] and Satan had you in a prison cell he
[1:35:35] had he had you there to where there was
[1:35:37] no way that you were going to get out
[1:35:40] you were God's Sons you were God's
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:45] Adam and Eve here's here's the first man
[1:35:50] the first woman
[1:35:54] amen they sin
[1:35:56] now when you sin the wages of sin is
[1:35:59] death
[1:36:00] now every one of God's children were in
[1:36:04] bars you're in jail
[1:36:06] every one of you they went to jail and
[1:36:08] you were born in jail all of God's
[1:36:10] people were born in jail
[1:36:12] born you're you were prisoners to sin
[1:36:15] there was no hope for you
[1:36:17] Satan is the Jailer amen so here here is
[1:36:21] Satan with his with his pitches his
[1:36:24] horns and well I don't even look like

[1:36:31] right there he's got you he's got you
[1:36:33] all all in jail
[1:36:35] and he knows
[1:36:38] that a Kinsmen redeemer is the only one
[1:36:40] that is going to be able to get you free
[1:36:43] God looks over here God the great invis
[1:36:47] or the great Pillar of Fire he can't do
[1:36:49] nothing
[1:36:51] because a righteous man's got to die and
[1:36:54] every man that is born is that is born
[1:36:55] of a woman is born speaking lies shaping
[1:36:57] an iniquity and there's no hope
[1:37:00] so God comes down
[1:37:02] God builds him a body in in a in in a
[1:37:06] little baby right here in a in a Manger
[1:37:09] it is born he grows up he pays the
[1:37:12] ransom and then God comes in opens the
[1:37:16] prison doors for you so that you can
[1:37:19] come out and be free
[1:37:22] amen
[1:37:25] Jesus became your sin
[1:37:30] so that you can come out of the
[1:37:32] jailhouse
[1:37:35] you're still looking at me puzzled amen
[1:37:37] you'll understand
[1:37:39] now what's going to happen for those who
[1:37:43] refuse to come out
[1:37:46] for those who refuse
[1:37:49] there's nothing left but judgment
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:56] if they choose to still be Sinners if
[1:37:59] they choose to steal a man to not accept
[1:38:02] the blood of Jesus Christ what we have
[1:38:05] just seen now is he is now the judge
[1:38:09] he's got the wig on he is standing there
[1:38:12] with a book
[1:38:14] amen he is he is standing there saying
[1:38:17] listen I was once your mercy I was once
[1:38:21] there trying to help you I sent you
[1:38:23] preachers I sent you mamas and daddies I
[1:38:26] sit and you refused
[1:38:29] now Jesus Is Standing There Eyes Of Fire
[1:38:34] got the wig on as a judge his feet is
[1:38:37] brass
[1:38:39] and he is now going to bring judgment to
[1:38:43] all of those
[1:38:44] who have who have refused to accept him
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:49] amen the Bible says those feet of brass
[1:38:51] will crush his enemies
[1:38:54] and there will be no hiding of that
[1:38:56] judgment there will be no longer the
[1:38:59] mediator his interceding days are over
[1:39:02] can you say amen hallelujah now he'll be
[1:39:06] the judge of the Earth
[1:39:08] right now he's still the mediator
[1:39:11] and you think why does God allow those
[1:39:14] transgenders why does God allow all
[1:39:17] those filthy things to go on is because
[1:39:19] God is still standing there interceding
[1:39:22] he's still standing there waiting for
[1:39:24] the very last of his sons to come in
[1:39:26] he's still sending preachers out amen
[1:39:29] that's why we come to church that's the
[1:39:31] reason why it's so important for us make
[1:39:33] sure you tell your friends about Jesus
[1:39:35] tell your friends about what God is
[1:39:37] doing get him in this church now if they
[1:39:39] stay that's up to God
[1:39:41] if they want to accept it that's up to
[1:39:43] God but our job is to get him in here
[1:39:46] and try to preach that gospel is the
[1:39:48] best we can and to try to tell them
[1:39:51] about the about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:53] the best we can is that right because
[1:39:55] the day will come
[1:39:59] where he's not just going to sit there
[1:40:01] in Mercy
[1:40:03] right now
[1:40:04] there's trampling all over God they're
[1:40:07] trampling all over his word
[1:40:09] right now they're saying if he was God
[1:40:12] come on they think he's a myth but one
[1:40:16] day Arnold Schwarzenegger who just got
[1:40:18] up and said heaven and hell are just
[1:40:20] myths
[1:40:23] one day
[1:40:25] Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to find
[1:40:27] out
[1:40:28] that there is a real God
[1:40:30] and Mercy's over
[1:40:33] and now he's going to stand before God
[1:40:36] as the judge and you can't ask
[1:40:38] forgiveness then
[1:40:42] these transgenders and all of this kind
[1:40:44] of stuff that's going on around here all
[1:40:46] this filthiness in the world
[1:40:48] it might look like God's just where is
[1:40:51] God
[1:40:53] God is looking he's looking for his own
[1:40:57] he's sending you a mom and a daddy and

[1:52:32] to just wash us
[1:52:34] he wants to take the heart of the pig
[1:52:37] out
