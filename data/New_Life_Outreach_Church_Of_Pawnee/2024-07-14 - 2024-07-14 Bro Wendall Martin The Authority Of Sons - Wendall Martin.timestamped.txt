[1:36] technology it's advancing faster and
[1:39] taking less time to be widely adopted
[1:41] than ever
[1:43] before launch ai ai is basically an
[1:47] emulation of us they're one very special
[1:49] person to me autonomous driving started
[1:52] AI can give us that answer that we've
[1:54] been seeking all along are we alone each
[1:56] time we create a more powerful
[1:58] technology we create a bigger ever for
[2:00] changing the world artificial
[2:02] intelligence can help us to feed the
[2:05] world population AI is teaching the
[2:07] machine and the Machine becoming smart
[2:10] all out of the realm of sci-fi and magic
[2:12] and now just science
[2:15] [Music]
[2:19] ready we're at the dawn of a new
[2:21] age the age of AI
[2:27] [Music]
[2:33] also science will
[2:37] progress especially in the mechanical
[2:42] world automobiles will continue to get
[2:45] like egg
[2:49] shape finally they will build one that
[2:52] won't need a steering
[2:53] wheel they've got it
[2:55] [Music]
[2:57] now it will be controlled by some some
[3:00] other power now if you'll watch as sure
[3:03] as that achievement was by science if
[3:07] the person will have a spiritual mind
[3:09] and understand it
[3:12] represented a achievement of God's
[3:16] economy with his church
[3:19] amen so they was able to achieve it by
[3:22] scientific research and when it happened
[3:25] on Earth God represented with a
[3:28] achievement by his
[3:30] church for things which are do appear
[3:33] was made of things that does not appear
[3:35] seeall a reflection of it now the har
[3:38] and buggy days was who that was the
[3:41] ending of the Lutheran age see har and
[3:45] buggy days they believed in
[3:47] justification God bringing the church
[3:50] from
[3:52] romanism Catholicism he brought it into
[3:55] its first spiritual achievement that the
[3:58] just shall live by
[4:01] faith that was a horse and buggy days as
[4:04] it come from the to the horse and buggy
[4:07] days the next achievement man had in the
[4:10] way of
[4:11] transportation was uh the
[4:15] automobile and you notice that
[4:18] automobile increases all the time in its
[4:21] uh
[4:23] Power now at the end of the Wesley age
[4:28] brought in by spiritual achievement
[4:33] sanctification which means the church
[4:35] raised from a Justified state to a
[4:38] Sanctified State now I want you to
[4:41] remember this as we go along that the
[4:44] church called church is not the church
[4:47] amen the church is church spiritual amen
[4:51] and then Alone Come
[4:53] Pentecost and as science of the world
[4:57] was able to achieve
[5:00] A A Automobile motor the right brothers
[5:05] that created or made manufactured rather
[5:09] the airplane the Flying Machine was far
[5:14] above the car on the earth because he
[5:18] tuck to the air now the right Brothers
[5:22] through their achievement was able to
[5:25] take signs and pattern something here on
[5:29] Earth to show that there was a great
[5:32] spiritual thing fixing to happen amen I
[5:34] when the right Brothers was able to
[5:36] achieve to get a man's feet off the
[5:39] ground Pentecost fell and Tuck to the
[5:42] air with the spiritual
[5:45] giah with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:48] it tued to the
[5:50] air oh hallah got is s off the ground so
[5:54] he could he can swim around Hallelujah
[5:58] got up in the air oh how far he was
[6:01] above the horse and buy how far he was
[6:04] above the automobile he was up in the
[6:06] air he was knocking and puffing and
[6:08] banging but he was
[6:10] flying see what man achieves on Earth
[6:15] for their made of things which do not
[6:17] appear God was able to achieve something
[6:20] by a spirit filled people who were
[6:23] hungering and thirsting and those that
[6:26] would stay with the word
[6:29] but now something else is happening we
[6:33] got an astronaut
[6:38] now John Glenn was our first astronaut
[6:42] and we find out that that's so far be an
[6:45] airplane airplane can only go as far as
[6:48] his pressure and so forth but this is by
[6:51] an atomic power a greater power that
[6:53] presses him so much higher than an
[6:54] airplane airplane even isn't in it right
[6:58] he's been able to do that
[7:00] all right now we got an astronaut
[7:03] natural age and remember the messenger
[7:06] comes at the end of the former method
[7:09] always we prove that there now we're on
[7:12] the astronaut line
[7:19] hey God has science has been able to
[7:22] prove that there's an astronaut that can
[7:25] go so far till you couldn't see it with
[7:26] your natural eyes and it can go where
[7:28] there's any pressure there or not he can
[7:31] just go on out because in a pressurized
[7:32] tank and he can go up there and sail
[7:35] around and see the world around an
[7:37] astronaut oh my what an age that that is
[7:42] coming yes sir go beyond any natural
[7:45] things at all Sweep come on
[7:47] out what does it
[7:49] represent a spiritual age a spiritual
[7:53] time the word God's going to have
[7:56] spiritual astrona
[8:00] amen they're here right now Hallelujah
[8:04] the Eagles of the air that can go beyond
[8:07] any
[8:08] other sail above
[8:11] everything spiritual
[8:13] astronauts Glory that could take the
[8:15] word of God and prove that he's the same
[8:20] yes a spiritual
[8:23] astronaut oh my glory that makes me feel
[8:27] good May in this age
[8:30] now what a wonderful thing for a
[8:32] spiritual astronaut
[8:34] see what is it what did the natural
[8:38] scientist do has been able to achieve
[8:41] that and God through man who would stay
[8:44] with the Bible and say that he's the
[8:46] same yesterday today and forever and not
[8:49] afraid of the promise regardless what
[8:50] anybody said stay with it amen what is
[8:54] it you're becoming an
[8:56] astronaut that can go so far as Beyond
[8:59] denominational things beyond anything
[9:02] else it's beyond the things of the
[9:06] church and him alone
[9:11] you we're at the dawn of a new
[9:13] age the age of
[9:15] AI we're at the dawn of a new
[9:18] age the age of AI
[9:23] [Music]
[9:24] [Applause]
[9:25] [Music]
[9:29] now if you'll watch as sure as that
[9:33] achievement was by science if the person
[9:36] will have a spiritual mind and
[9:39] understand it
[9:40] represented a achievement of God's
[9:44] economy with his
[9:48] church so they was able to achieve it by
[9:51] scientific research and when it happened
[9:54] on Earth God represented with a
[9:57] achievement by his church
[10:00] or things which are do appear was made
[10:02] of things that does not appear see a
[10:05] reflection of it okay hi my name is Bob
[10:08] um in view of its potential to to be
[10:11] possibly the biggest game changer ever
[10:14] do you have any plans to enter the field
[10:17] of artificial intelligence and in
[10:19] general what are your thoughts on it do
[10:20] you think it's even close to being ready
[10:23] for prime
[10:24] time I think we should be very careful
[10:27] about artificial intelligence um if I
[10:29] were
[10:30] guess at what our biggest existential
[10:32] threat
[10:33] is it's probably
[10:36] that um so we need to be very careful
[10:39] with artificial intelligence I'm
[10:41] increasingly inclined to think that
[10:42] there should be some uh regulatory
[10:46] oversight um at the maybe at the
[10:49] national and international level uh just
[10:52] to make sure that we don't do something
[10:54] very foolish um I mean with artificial
[10:58] intelligence we are summoning the demon
[11:00] you know you know those stories where
[11:02] there's the guy with the pentagram and
[11:04] the holy water and he's like yeah he's
[11:05] sure he can control a demon doesn't work
[11:08] out people's science has broke into
[11:12] God's Great laboratory until they're
[11:13] going to destroy themselves God lets
[11:16] always lets wisdom destroy
[11:19] himself God doesn't destroy anything man
[11:21] destroys himself by wisdom as he did at
[11:24] the beginning taking Satan's wisdom and
[11:27] instead of God's word
[11:29] in the Garden of Eden there were two
[11:31] trees one was knowledge and one was life
[11:34] and as long as man eat off the tree of
[11:35] life he had everlasting life the first
[11:37] bite he took from the Tree of knowledge
[11:39] he separated his Fellowship from God and
[11:42] every time he takes a bite yet he
[11:43] destroys himself he bit off gunpowder
[11:46] look what that does he bit off
[11:48] automobile off the tree of knowledge
[11:50] kills more of his comrades than all the
[11:51] wars does there won't be one of them in
[11:54] that City there won't be one car one
[11:57] airplane no it'll be an Al together a
[11:59] different civilization it'll be again a
[12:02] civilization not of knowledge not of
[12:04] science but of innocence and faith and
[12:07] the Living God let us strive to enter
[12:10] into that down then it started right
[12:13] back coming back to the church come back
[12:14] from the feet coming up now it's in a
[12:16] head time head time now notice the light
[12:21] you can't see with your hands yet it's
[12:23] part of the body you can't see with the
[12:25] ears yet it can hear you can't see with
[12:28] the nose that it smells you can't you
[12:31] can't see with the lips though it
[12:34] speaks see that was a Pentecostal age
[12:38] but now it's in the eye
[12:40] time the
[12:43] scene now there isn't one moving faculty
[12:46] beyond the
[12:48] eye is that right the next is the
[12:51] intelligence which is Christ itself who
[12:53] controls the whole body no moving motion
[12:58] beyond that
[13:00] everything else is moved see move your
[13:02] feet move your muscles and your legs
[13:04] move everything move your your ears can
[13:06] move your nose your lips and so forth
[13:08] but after your eyes there's nothing
[13:10] moves surely was what was it it was a it
[13:13] a body growing from the feet coming up
[13:16] comes up more important parts of the
[13:18] body from the feet on into the lungs and
[13:21] the Heart on into the
[13:23] head who is the
[13:25] head who is the head Christ that's
[13:29] elligence how the body move by the head
[13:33] amen amen and the government shall be
[13:36] upon what his what is his shoulders his
[13:39] body amen that's where the real true
[13:42] church speaks in his power that's where
[13:44] the apostolic power returns to the
[13:46] church when the government shall be upon
[13:48] his shoulders
[13:50] judgment there's coming a real
[13:53] church I believe trying to do my part to
[13:57] present it have it ready to best I know
[13:59] how to present my part in my age to
[14:02] Christ when he comes notice what Harmony
[14:06] Jesus never did anything until seen of
[14:10] the father or the father showed him
[14:12] first Harmony between God and
[14:15] Christ John
[14:18] 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her
[14:22] his word of life he shows her and she
[14:27] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[14:31] can harm her not even death for if the
[14:34] seed be planted the water will raise it
[14:37] up again amen now I got a great big
[14:41] Hallelujah here is the secret the word
[14:44] is in the
[14:47] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[14:51] what he wants done with the word and she
[14:54] does it in his
[14:56] name she has
[14:59] thus sayith the Lord
[15:04] amen then it is gerti so the Holy Spirit
[15:07] Waters it until it is grown and serves
[15:11] its purpose they do only his
[15:16] will heyen I believe that no one can
[15:20] persuade them
[15:23] different they have thus sayeth the Lord
[15:26] or they keep still
[15:29] amen then they will do the works of God
[15:32] for it is himself in them continuing his
[15:35] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[15:39] his days all things when he was here he
[15:43] did not complete all when he was here
[15:46] for it was not time yet now if you'll
[15:49] watch as sure as that achievement was by
[15:53] science if the person will have a
[15:56] spiritual mind and understand if
[15:59] represented a achievement of God's
[16:03] economy with his church
[16:06] am so they was able to achieve it by
[16:10] scientific research and when it happened
[16:13] on Earth God represented with a
[16:16] achievement by his
[16:18] church for things which are do appear
[16:20] was made of things which does not appear
[16:23] hallu the reflection of it

[23:25] Elijah and recognizing
[23:28] that he was the seventh Church age

[23:36] had come back
[23:39] amen the son of man to reveal himself to
