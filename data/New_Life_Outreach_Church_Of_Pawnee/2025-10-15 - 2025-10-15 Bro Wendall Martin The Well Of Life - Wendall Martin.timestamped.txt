[8:19] to tell you of our love.

[8:28] as they continue to play that softly.
[8:30] Now, I'd like to go to prayer if we can
[8:33] here tonight.
[8:35] We do have one need from brother Caleb
[8:37] Farweather. It says, "Ask in prayer for
[8:40] my grandpa Rob. His health is declining
[8:43] rapidly and he needs God's hand and
[8:46] whatever God decides, we will praise him
[8:48] because he could do anything." I believe
[8:50] that here tonight. Amen. And I'm going
[8:52] to ask Brother Caleb if you would mind
[8:54] coming and and leading us in prayer. I
[8:56] want to say I'm very thankful that the
[8:58] Lord brought uh baby uh Lucas Oliver
[9:02] into the world safely.
[9:04] Amen. I know

[9:09] are very appreciative of your prayers. I

[9:15] coming home tomorrow. So let's just
[9:17] They're home. Okay. Well, let's just

[9:22] that the Lord gives them much needed
[9:24] rest and and that sister Loretta just
[9:27] recovers
[9:29] uh just recovers extremely well. Amen.
[9:32] If you have a need upon your heart
[9:34] tonight, just make it known by the
[9:35] lifting of your hand. God bless you.

[9:40] I also like to ask uh Traveling Mercy's
[9:43] for my parents. They're going to be

[9:47] grandpa.
[9:49] But just keep them in prayer. Let's bow
[9:52] our heads.

[20:35] Aren't you glad
[20:39] for God's great love to you, his
[20:43] blessings to his people. Amen. I'm so
[20:46] glad that we can come to the well, the
[20:49] well of living waters, Jesus Christ.
[20:52] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Good
[20:54] to be in the house of the Lord today.
[20:57] Amen. And uh how many's glad you're a
[20:59] Christian tonight.
[21:03] Amen. Glad to be a son of God. And uh so
[21:09] thankful for his grace upon our lives.
[21:12] Amen. Well, let's look here in the
[21:14] scriptures tonight. And uh you guys are
[21:17] probably wondering what in the world do
[21:19] we have going on here. Hallelujah.
[21:22] And um Amen. Well, you're fixing to find
[21:27] out.
[21:29] Uh praise the Lord.
[21:32] We um we want to look here in the book
[21:36] of St. John, the fourth chapter and the
[21:39] 14th verse.
[21:43] And uh
[21:45] I might have to turn that if that if
[21:47] that water gets too distracting,
[21:50] turn it off until I'm ready for it. But
[21:52] u
[21:53] amen
[21:58] praise the Lord. Um John 4 and14 but
[22:02] whosoever drinkketh of the water that I
[22:06] shall give him shall never thirst
[22:11] but the water that I shall give him
[22:13] shall be in him a well of water
[22:17] springing up into everlasting life.
[22:21] I'd also like to look here in
[22:23] Revelations 22
[22:26] and um the uh
[22:31] 10th verse
[22:35] and it says, "And he saith unto me, seal
[22:39] not the sayings of the prophecy of this
[22:41] book, for the time is at hand. He that
[22:45] is unjust, let him be unjust, steal. He
[22:49] that is filthy, let him be filthy still.
[22:53] He that is righteous, let him be
[22:55] righteous still. And he that is holy,
[22:58] let him be holy still. Behold, I come
[23:01] quickly. My reward is with me to give
[23:04] every man according as his work shall
[23:07] be. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
[23:10] and the end, the first and the last.
[23:12] Blessed are they that do his
[23:14] commandments, that they may have the
[23:17] right to eat of the tree of life, and
[23:20] may enter in through the gates into the
[23:22] city. For without are dogs, and
[23:25] sorcerers, and whoreongers, and
[23:27] murderers,
[23:29] idoltors,
[23:31] and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie, I
[23:35] Jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[23:38] unto you these things in the churches. I
[23:41] am the rooe and offspring of David and
[23:43] the bright and morning star.
[23:45] And the spirit and the bride say come.
[23:50] Let him that heareth say come. Let him
[23:54] that is a thirst come. Whosoever will
[23:58] let him take of the water of life
[24:01] freely. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[24:05] Father, we want to thank you for your
[24:06] grace tonight. We thank you for your
[24:09] blessings and the anointing that you
[24:12] have
[24:14] placed upon us in this generation.
[24:17] For Lord, we are not just called to
[24:19] drink of the water of life, but we are
[24:21] to give of this life. And Father, we're
[24:24] just asking now tonight that you would
[24:26] take my thoughts, Lord, and just bring
[24:29] everything together and that you would
[24:32] minister to our hearts tonight, young
[24:34] and old to understand. and we'll give
[24:36] you glory and honor in Jesus name. Can
[24:39] the church say amen?
[24:42] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be
[24:44] seated.
[24:46] Amen. Taking the water of life.
[24:49] We
[24:51] there is a the fountain of life
[24:55] and and we want to talk about that here
[25:00] tonight. Amen. Um, it's it's a great
[25:04] it's a great thing for us to to know the
[25:08] ways of God, to love God.
[25:12] But our as we begin to think here this
[25:16] evening,
[25:17] I've got two pools of water that are
[25:20] that are seated there and or that are
[25:22] that are here before you. And um and so
[25:27] uh we're going to we're going to talk
[25:29] about our heart and the importance of of
[25:32] us um uh
[25:36] our our hearts being right with God. And
[25:40] um we are all born we're all born in the
[25:44] muck and the mire of sin. Like to say
[25:46] it's good to see mom. She had eye
[25:47] surgery today and so but it's good to
[25:49] see her tonight. Amen.
[25:54] So, we we were all born in in the muck
[25:57] and mire of sin. And I don't know uh if
[26:00] you can see this over here. This here is
[26:03] is
[26:04] stagnant. Uh uh I got I got some moss
[26:09] out of the out of the pond. And so this
[26:11] here is going to represent I don't know
[26:12] for those of you that could see, we got
[26:14] moss and seaweed and and uh lots of lots
[26:19] of junk here. And and so tonight I want
[26:22] us to this is this is humanity. This is
[26:26] about the best we can come up with. And
[26:29] um and and then we over on this side
[26:32] here. This is to represent an artisian
[26:35] well. This is a well that is springing
[26:37] up. Amen. This is what God does in our
[26:41] lives. We're born in the muck and the
[26:44] mire of sin, but yet God does something
[26:47] great within us. And and the and this is
[26:52] this is the beauty of what God has has
[26:55] done when we become a Christian. He
[26:58] takes all of the junk out of our hearts.
[27:02] He takes all of the muck out of us and
[27:04] he he washes us new. And now the Bible
[27:08] says as as we read there their first
[27:13] scripture, Amen. that that you can drink
[27:16] of this living water, living water.
[27:20] We're going to we're going to talk about

[28:02] Griggsby's.
[28:04] And um right up under the water, it was
[28:07] so cold. But under this big old cliff,
[28:11] there was water that was bubbling up out
[28:14] of this cliff and it was just as pure
[28:17] and cold and and clean as as any. And
[28:21] you could you you get you put your hand

[28:54] Hole and different ones have swam around
[28:56] through there. But but the water Amen.
[29:00] some of the the major source. Uh uh
[29:03] there was others on upstream as well,
[29:05] but this was one of the major sources
[29:08] that that where it had come out and it
[29:10] would just bubble and there was never no
[29:13] time of the year, no time of their year,
[29:16] how many knows what dog days are? Amen.
[29:19] Now, around this part of the country,
[29:21] you might not know anything about dog
[29:23] days, but uh back in our times when the
[29:26] when the when the the the the the
[29:29] streams aren't flowing as much anymore
[29:31] and the rains hasn't hasn't come in a
[29:33] while, then the water will become
[29:35] stagnant and and the streams will
[29:39] actually begin to start looking like
[29:41] that because there's no water flowing
[29:44] anymore even though it's a creek and
[29:46] there's no water flowing. And so, uh, it
[29:49] it moss and and and and trash gets
[29:52] caught up in there. But Griggsbees
[29:56] never did have any any kind of moss ever
[30:01] ever coming into that. Why is because it
[30:04] was just constantly bubbling. It was
[30:07] just constantly giving water. Well,
[30:10] Jesus is telling now, we we talked about
[30:13] the woman at the well last week. Amen.
[30:16] that this woman that had a really bad
[30:19] life. She her her mama and daddy turned
[30:22] her out. They weren't good parents at
[30:24] the beginning and and she ended up uh a
[30:28] promiscuous girl at an early age. She
[30:31] had her life was scarred uh abused by
[30:34] men, married five times. The one she was
[30:37] with wasn't her husband. It was a it was
[30:41] a rough life that this woman was was
[30:44] living. And when Jesus was telling
[30:47] asking her, he says, "Give me to drink."
[30:50] And she says, "Listen, you know, it's
[30:52] not even appropriate for you to be
[30:54] talking to me." And Jesus says, "If if
[30:57] you knew who was talking to you, you
[31:00] would ask me for a drink." And she says,
[31:04] "How can you give me a drink? The well
[31:06] is deep. You don't have anything to let
[31:09] down water." And Jesus says, "Amen." And
[31:12] and then as he begins to talk, then she
[31:15] begins to to to think. Amen. As he says,
[31:19] "If you ask me to drink, I'll give you
[31:23] water.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; I will fill your thirst. It will quench
[31:29] your thirst, and out of your belly shall
[31:33] flow rivers of living water."
[31:38] &gt;&gt; And she and this woman looked at Jesus.
[31:41] Now, she had been abused. She had been
[31:44] through man after man. But this was not
[31:46] the average guy. This was God in a body
[31:51] and offering her something, amen, that
[31:55] would cleanse her and make her totally
[31:58] clean on the inside, clean her mind,
[32:00] clean her heart, and make her the lady
[32:02] that she always wanted to be.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; And so what what we what we seen of that
[32:08] story and she was changed. We found
[32:10] Amen. that she was one of the women that
[32:12] that came to worship Jesus as he was as
[32:16] as as he was going to Calvary,
[32:18] ministering unto Jesus because Jesus had
[32:22] changed her life.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; And I want to say tonight, amen, for you
[32:26] boys and girls, we are all born looking
[32:31] like that over there. Now, we all look
[32:34] pretty and we got curlers in our hair or
[32:36] curls in our hair and and and and we're
[32:39] all dressed up nice and we all look
[32:41] Amen. Uh hopefully you boys ain't got
[32:43] curlers in your hairs. Hallelujah. And
[32:45] and uh but this is what we are. But when
[32:48] Jesus comes, Jesus comes to give us the
[32:52] abundance of life. He does not want a
[32:55] stagnant uh uh relationship with us. Now
[32:59] remember, when you go and the and the
[33:01] water becomes stagnant, you go uh this
[33:04] time of the year and you start going out
[33:06] there to the ponds and it everything's
[33:08] all scummy, everything is and and
[33:10] there's only there's there's not much
[33:12] that that that even want that kind of a
[33:14] life. And and h us humans sure don't
[33:17] want to be over there uh uh drinking out
[33:19] of that water. But we want the water of
[33:22] eternal life. We want that water of
[33:25] eternal life. That's and I believe
[33:27] that's what God has has come to give us.
[33:31] And I think the greatest illustration it
[33:33] was was there in in the book of of
[33:36] Galatians the fifth chapter.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; And I'll just read this to you.
[33:42] Amen. If I can get to Galatians here.
[33:47] And so um
[33:49] Galatians 5
[33:55] and this will give us so here's here's
[33:58] Galatians Galatians 5 and 19. Now the
[34:02] works of the flesh are manifest. Which
[34:04] are these? Adultery, fornication,
[34:07] uncleanness, less ciousness, idolatry,
[34:11] witchcraft, hatred, variance, imulation,
[34:13] wrath, strife, sedition, stage,
[34:16] heresies, envings, murders, drunkenness,
[34:19] revelings, and such like, of which I
[34:22] tell you before, as I have told you in
[34:24] times past, that they which do these
[34:26] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[34:30] God. Amen. This is why we've got to be
[34:33] born again. This is why This is why we
[34:35] come to church. This is why we pray.
[34:38] This is why we ask God, "Lord, help me."
[34:41] Amen. And And that's why That's why you
[34:44] children, how many How many of you
[34:45] children and you girls listen to me up
[34:47] here, too, because I'm talking to you
[34:49] youngans tonight as well. How many of
[34:51] you How many of you children have have
[34:53] ever told a lie?
[34:58] Hallelujah. Well, there's some of you
[34:59] that's being honest. Hallelujah. All
[35:01] right. There. How How many of you have
[35:04] have have done things that were wrong?
[35:06] You we we've done things that were
[35:08] wrong. You know why? Amen. How many of
[35:11] you teenagers have done things that were
[35:13] wrong?
[35:15] Sure. Hallelujah. And uh uh uh because
[35:20] this is this is the way our heart this
[35:22] is the way our heart was is uh we were
[35:26] born in sin. We were born shapen in
[35:28] iniquity. That's That's who we are. How
[35:31] many would ever want to get a drink of
[35:32] water? Y'all y'all We got a cup
[35:34] somewhere. Y'all want a drink of that
[35:36] water over there? Hallelujah. See, we we
[35:39] can't we can't offer that to God. But
[35:41] what God has given to us, he has taken
[35:45] that dirty, filthy woman that no one
[35:49] wanted to be with and made her one of
[35:52] the greatest uh uh testimonies of the
[35:56] New Testament. that lady become a truly
[36:00] wonderful model of a Christian in the
[36:03] New Testament church. The woman at the
[36:05] well, the woman that no one wanted to be
[36:08] with, the woman that had her life so
[36:10] messed up, that woman become a pillar in
[36:14] the church of God because of what God
[36:18] done in her life.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; You know what happens when you get the
[36:23] well of life? that stuff cannot hang
[36:27] around anymore.
[36:29] It's not It's not that there is no moss
[36:33] that ever comes into the into the living
[36:36] water. It's not that there's no trash.
[36:39] It's that the bubble that the the the
[36:42] pressure of the water coming up does not
[36:45] allow the trash to stay there.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; The trash pushes it out. And when you
[36:51] ever get the power of God's eternal Holy
[36:56] Spirit and it begins to bubble up, it be
[37:00] oh, it begins to push that I can't lie.
[37:04] I shouldn't tell. No sir, I can't. You
[37:07] repent. And what is it doing? It's
[37:09] constantly just bubbling and pushing all
[37:11] of that junk out of your life.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; But if you don't have that force behind
[37:17] it, that is what you are.
[37:21] Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; So, I wanted to give y'all a visual here
[37:25] tonight because our our lives have got
[37:28] to be first of all, we've got to have
[37:32] that experience with God. And second of
[37:34] all, we have got to be a testimony to
[37:37] others about his grace in our lives.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it it is his grace in our
[37:43] lives. And I think I think that's what
[37:46] is so important as we talked last week
[37:48] about about the gatekeeper. It's so
[37:52] important that we have mamas and daddies
[37:54] as gatekeepers. Amen. That are standing
[37:57] there watching over the evil. Amen. And
[38:00] and making sure that we are identifying
[38:04] the spirits that that that are coming
[38:07] in. Amen. and and trying to pull because
[38:10] if we don't discern the way it is even
[38:12] brother Brandham talked about his in
[38:14] question and answers he talked about his
[38:15] messages and and he says you know he
[38:17] says I can say one thing he says and I'm
[38:20] so misunderstood he says it's and and
[38:22] then it's this way or that way one gets
[38:25] it on this side and the way it is and
[38:27] you say something right straight towards
[38:29] a point and one hears it this way so he
[38:32] tells another one and it leans a little
[38:33] bit further and then the next one leans
[38:35] a little bit further and and the next a
[38:37] a little further and then it's got plum
[38:39] out of cater one hears it the other way
[38:42] and he goes this way this way that way
[38:44] that way he says and and you and you get
[38:47] away and that's the that's the way it it
[38:50] is out there in the meetings and so
[38:51] forth when you're really driving it
[38:53] right to a spot he says but the elect
[38:57] will hear that spot they get that spot
[39:02] they know because I said just exactly
[39:05] what was meant like that just the
[39:08] message just exactly. So how many wants
[39:11] how many wants to know God get my ears
[39:14] what you want to hear cuz I what what
[39:18] you want me to hear because it's
[39:20] important to keep that trash out of my
[39:22] life
[39:24] &gt;&gt; cuz it's important. Now what we just
[39:26] read here in the book of Revelations,
[39:27] Amen. This is the very last of the
[39:29] Bible. This is the rapture is has taken
[39:33] place. Amen. the rap we it's talking
[39:35] about our season where the time where
[39:38] let him that is filthy be filthy still
[39:41] let him that is unholy let him be unholy
[39:44] still let him that is righteous let him
[39:47] be righteous still this is where we're
[39:49] at we are so close to the coming of the
[39:52] Lord that that that there is no way amen
[39:57] that here it is it's going to be coming
[39:59] here soon if we do not accept God's gift
[40:03] into our alive and bubble that junk out
[40:06] of our lives, we're going to be stuck
[40:08] unrighteous.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; We're going to be stuck. Well, praise
[40:11] the Lord. If you boys and girls, Amen,
[40:14] don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[40:17] And that's what this living water is all
[40:19] about. Living water is the baptism of
[40:23] the Holy Ghost.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; And that living water is the only thing
[40:28] that is going, Amen. to to to bubble
[40:31] pornography out of your mind. Amen. That
[40:34] living water is the only thing that is
[40:36] going to Amen. push that lying devil out
[40:39] of your mind, out of your out of your
[40:42] life. Amen. Push all of that. It's the
[40:45] only thing that'll work.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Now, preachers today, preachers today
[40:53] are saying, "Well, it's okay to to look
[40:55] at a little Amen. It's it's okay to look
[40:57] as long as you don't touch." That is a
[40:59] lie. Jesus said, "He that looks upon a
[41:02] woman to commit adultery or or or to
[41:05] lust after her has committed adultery
[41:07] with her already."
[41:09] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? But but but the
[41:12] but Satan will be there to push you and
[41:15] push you, but you've got to make up your
[41:18] mind. Are you going to grow up
[41:21] looking good, looking buff? Amen.
[41:25] walking down the street looking like and
[41:27] yet on the inside.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Yet on the inside looking like this.
[41:38] See, God knows what's on the inside
[41:41] and so will your future wife.
[41:44] [Laughter]
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? But on the on
[41:49] the other hand, Christ has come to make
[41:53] all things new.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Christ has come to bubble out all of
[41:59] those works of the flesh so that his
[42:02] grace can live and reign. Hallelujah.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Amen. And boys,
[42:10] y'all want to marry that or y'all want
[42:13] to marry this?
[42:15] Hallelujah. They said, "We don't want we
[42:17] don't want neither one of those. We want
[42:18] a girl." Hallelujah. Amen. But every
[42:22] every one of us are going, every girl is
[42:24] going to look like this or is going to
[42:26] look like that. Every boy has got this
[42:29] or has got this. But girls, which one do
[42:31] y'all want? This one or this one?
[42:35] Hallelujah. There's a song. I was in a I
[42:37] was in a I I I was in a a grocery store
[42:40] and I heard this song and and u and it
[42:44] stuck to me and and I hate to even say
[42:46] these things anymore because these kids
[42:48] can go and look it on the internet, but
[42:50] uh uh but there there was this deal that
[42:52] came up that says, "I like my women
[42:53] trashy."
[42:55] And I I thought,
[42:58] "Really?" And and and I I guess that's a
[43:00] that's a country song. I like my women
[43:02] trashy. You mean you like your women
[43:04] like this? You you want that kind of a
[43:07] thing right there that's not going to
[43:08] love God. That's not going to and and
[43:10] and she's not willing to surrender her
[43:12] life to God. You you you like you like
[43:15] somebody Amen. that that that's that's
[43:17] that that's that's that's not going to
[43:19] have the grace of God upon their lives.
[43:22] Well, come on, somebody. Amen. A son of
[43:25] God is not going to want his woman
[43:28] trashy. He's going to honor that girl
[43:32] that has got a pure heart, that's got a
[43:36] desire, that ain't going to go around
[43:38] flirting all the time, that ain't going
[43:41] around there batting her eyes at people
[43:43] and trying to get attention and trying
[43:45] to uh uh he he's not going to look he
[43:48] he's not going to look at that woman
[43:50] that's that's that's that's that that's
[43:52] got those tight clothing and and trying
[43:54] to get his attention. He's going to look
[43:57] for a woman that has got purity of
[44:00] heart.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Because it's not what's on the outside,
[44:08] it's what's on the inside.
[44:11] Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Now, that one that's got a pure heart,
[44:16] she might listen, she might she might
[44:19] not be as pretty as that one over there
[44:20] that's got that that's that's carrying
[44:22] that stuff around. But I'd rather have
[44:24] an ugly girl that's got this kind on the
[44:28] inside than to have a pretty girl. Well,
[44:31] praise the Lord. And you girls better
[44:35] get you a guy. It would be better if he
[44:37] had three noses. Amen. and six eyes and
[44:42] have this in his heart than to than to
[44:45] have all buff and strong and goodlooking
[44:48] and have that in his heart.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; I think if you if we if we've got boys
[44:59] growing up in the church, it should be
[45:01] an absolute
[45:03] abomination for y'all to look at stuff
[45:06] on that phone that is wrong.
[45:11] And if you do, you should be up at this
[45:13] altar every night until God gets you
[45:15] delivered.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to you boys.
[45:22] I'm talking to you boys.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; That devil is is right there to try to
[45:28] destroy you. and you and and and the
[45:30] thing is if you boys don't take control
[45:33] of your lives and ask God's grace upon
[45:37] your life and you don't get the baptism
[45:39] of the Holy Ghost, I don't care whether
[45:41] you whether you look or whether you
[45:43] don't look, your heart is that right
[45:45] there.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; You've got to have the living water of
[45:51] God on the inside of your life or you're
[45:54] going to be hell for your woman.
[46:00] Praise the Lord.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; So, and it's the same way with you
[46:03] girls. We have got these things. So, so
[46:06] you you have got to honor you, you boys
[46:10] have got to honor
[46:13] honor the Lord God with all of your
[46:15] heart.
[46:17] And you know, you know, you know what is
[46:20] there. But I I I I I so I you know
[46:23] before we got this wasn't a part of my
[46:25] message but I I this is the way we're
[46:27] starting out. I I think I I think we
[46:29] should strive and this that well of
[46:32] living water is the baptism of the Holy
[46:36] Ghost.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[46:43] mamas and daddies that's why it's so
[46:45] important. I sort of got on the leggings
[46:46] the other night. Or not the leggings. I
[46:48] guess they're the tights or whatever
[46:50] whatever those things are. Amen. If
[46:51] you're not careful, it it'll keep
[46:53] pulling you and pulling you and pulling
[46:54] you and pulling you. Amen. Those girls
[46:57] looking in the mirror and and that's
[46:58] those those are the same things that
[46:59] those girls walk wear. I mean, they're
[47:01] wearing those expandex out outside their
[47:04] at Walmart all the time. And you girls
[47:06] looking at yourself and and how cute you
[47:08] can look with your form like that.
[47:09] Satan, what what's the next church going
[47:11] to be? What's the next generation going
[47:13] to be? And this is why where brother
[47:15] Brandham says it'll go over and over and
[47:17] over and over and go this way. I and and
[47:19] I and and then till the preacher becomes
[47:21] the crank. But it's I'm here to tell you
[47:24] we've got to come back to the basics. If
[47:27] you want to if you want to wear
[47:28] something under your skirt, that's fine.
[47:31] Wear whatever you got to wear. Amen. But
[47:33] I'm here to tell you that the the the
[47:35] the way Satan is putting these things
[47:38] out there to you girls. Amen. And and
[47:41] let me just
[47:44] Hallelujah.
[47:45] You see what has taken place? Let me let
[47:48] me just talk to you girls for a minute.
[47:51] You're taking away
[47:53] the reason. You're taking away the the
[47:58] opportunity
[48:00] to present yourself as a lady.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; You no longer have to worry about your
[48:06] dress anymore. You no longer have to
[48:08] worry because you've got these other
[48:10] things here. And so you're taking away
[48:13] the training that is required for a
[48:16] woman until a woman can jump into a
[48:19] man's place and feel right at home.
[48:21] Whereas a woman could not do that before
[48:24] because she was had a dress on.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; But now a girl can climb a tree and she
[48:31] can do all these other things here. I'm
[48:32] not I'm not saying what's right or
[48:34] what's wrong. I am saying a woman has
[48:38] her place. Amen.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; And you girls, if you've got the purity
[48:44] of heart, it's going to bubble the
[48:47] things that the very appearance of evil
[48:51] we shun.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; The woman that's got this is saying, "I
[48:57] don't care what the preacher says. I
[48:59] don't care what I don't care what the
[49:01] Bible says. I don't care." And before
[49:03] you know it, it's it's, "Well, I don't
[49:05] care." Amen. Well, these ain't red
[49:08] lipstick. It is still lipstick. You're
[49:11] the lip gloss is you're you're bringing
[49:12] attention to your lips.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It used to be that it
[49:18] was wrong to wear to to to to to wear uh
[49:21] uh uh fingernail polish, but now we can
[49:24] we can we can add the add the clear
[49:26] stuff and and and we say it's all okay.
[49:28] And you say, "Well, it's for my nails."
[49:30] I don't wear the stuff and my nails look
[49:34] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Dirty. Amen.
[49:37] But what I am saying you if where what
[49:40] where are we going to stop? Because the
[49:42] women that are cutting their hair are
[49:44] saying we've got to cut our hair in
[49:47] order for the split ends
[49:50] in order to take care of the split ends
[49:52] because we want it to grow. That's just
[49:54] a lie.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Our girls do not cut their hair and
[49:58] their hair is nice and long. Yeah,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; but it's it but but but we it's spirits
[50:04] that are coming in and they're just
[50:06] moving moving the goalpost moving the
[50:10] goalpost. And you've got to ask
[50:11] yourself, what spirit is influencing me?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; What spirit is influencing me? Because I
[50:21] am not just got to have it pure in my
[50:22] heart, but the rest of the world, I am
[50:25] to be a witness to them.
[50:28] They have got to see something different
[50:30] in me. They've got to see, wait a
[50:33] minute, that girl is somebody that is
[50:37] that is very special. That guy is
[50:40] something that is very very special.
[50:43] They have a relationship with God that I
[50:47] want
[50:48] &gt;&gt; for myself.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Am I making sense? So
[50:53] we we want to watch every spirit because
[50:56] those spirits even though the prophet
[50:59] preached it very strong, very clear. How
[51:01] many can say amen?
[51:03] &gt;&gt; And yet he says and they go this way
[51:07] that way and they go d that way and they
[51:09] go and he says but the elect
[51:13] &gt;&gt; will understand what the spirit is
[51:16] telling the churches.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? So, so we want
[51:24] Am I doing all right here tonight? We
[51:26] want to be that kind of a of of a
[51:31] Christian, not to preach with this,
[51:35] &gt;&gt; but preach with this.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, now you can have this
[51:41] all all done here. As I say, you can
[51:43] have this all looking good and still
[51:44] look like that. But I want to say this
[51:47] that the artisian well will just bubble
[51:50] all that junk out.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. You say, "Brother
[51:54] Wendle, are you perfect?" No. But
[51:57] there's a pressure underneath me that
[51:58] keeps pushing that sin out of my life.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; It's not letting me Oh, can you say
[52:03] amen?
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Wendle, you mean you you
[52:06] don't you don't ever get tempted? Ha ha.
[52:08] I'm a human being. I am a redblooded
[52:12] male. Satan knows how to to to tempt me
[52:16] just like he tempts every other
[52:18] red-blooded man. But I've got the
[52:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm not going
[52:23] to let my life become a swamp. I want
[52:26] that living water on the inside of me
[52:29] bubbling that junk out of me.
[52:34] And I think we should all work and pray
[52:37] about those things in our lives. Can you
[52:39] say amen?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so those things, brother
[52:43] Brandham, say it's the it's the word of
[52:46] the living God. Somebody say it's the
[52:47] word
[52:48] &gt;&gt; of the living God. It's so essential
[52:51] till all heavens and earth will pass
[52:52] away. It shall never pass away. God
[52:55] notices every little word that we read.
[52:58] God knows every little thought that goes
[53:00] through our mind, every little act that
[53:02] we do. And I'm kind of thinking this
[53:04] that many times the church in its
[53:07] looseness gets to doing things and
[53:10] thinking things and taking things just
[53:13] as they are when they ought to weigh
[53:16] what we do and say we ought to think.
[53:23] Think we ought to think.
[53:27] And the bottom line is this. What is
[53:30] pushing?
[53:32] What is causing my thoughts? What is
[53:35] causing my actions? What is making me do
[53:39] what I'm doing?
[53:42] &gt;&gt; We've got an entire
[53:45] world system, church system that is
[53:48] saying, "I'm in love with Jesus.
[53:52] He loves me and I love him." And the
[53:55] Bible says he's not even in the church.
[54:00] I'm increased with goods. I have need. I
[54:02] don't need.
[54:04] They're in this lukewarm,
[54:08] stale, stagnant condition claiming to be
[54:12] the bride of Jesus Christ. Are y'all
[54:15] hearing me?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want that kind of a spirit.
[54:19] We can always go back to the Bible, line
[54:21] ours up, and say, "All right, which
[54:23] spirit is influencing me?" Can I hear a
[54:25] great big amen?
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A great big A great big
[54:29] amen. I want life in me. Can you say
[54:33] amen?
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says we ought to think what
[54:37] before we even speak. My old mammy uh
[54:39] used to tell me, think twice, speak
[54:41] once. It's the little things sometimes
[54:43] that we leave undone. That means so much
[54:46] to us. We get in such a hurry to race
[54:48] over things in this new erotic age we
[54:51] live in. It would behoove us as the
[54:54] church of God tonight to stop and wait a
[54:57] minute and see where we're at.
[55:03] How many believes that's okay
[55:06] &gt;&gt; now? Amen. So, this message has teeth in
[55:09] it. Amen. It it's it's it's it's what we
[55:12] have. Now there there in in Matthew 15
[55:16] and7 it says you hypocrites well did
[55:19] Isaiah prophesy of you saying this
[55:22] people draws nigh unto me with their
[55:25] mouth and honorth me with their lips but
[55:30] their heart is far from me. He is
[55:33] putting he is putting the church of his
[55:36] day in that swimming pool over there.
[55:39] And I want to say uh uh thank you,
[55:42] Sister Katrina, for getting me these
[55:43] swimming pools. Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, it takes it it takes it
[55:47] takes an army around here to do all this
[55:49] stuff. Amen. And so, Amen. He says, "But
[55:53] in vain
[55:55] in vain they do worship me."
[56:00] In vain they do worship me. Where am I
[56:04] at? Teaching for doctrines the
[56:06] commandments of men. He called the
[56:08] multitude and said unto them, "Hear and
[56:09] understand, not that which goeth into
[56:12] the mouth defileth a man, but that which
[56:15] cometh out of the mouth, this defileleth
[56:18] a man." Down to the 16th verse. And
[56:20] Jesus said, "Uh, are are you yet?" Let's
[56:23] just let's go back up there to the uh
[56:25] 12th verse, Sister Keys.
[56:28] Then there came the disciples and said,
[56:29] "Thou knowest the Pharisees were
[56:31] offended after they heard this saying."
[56:34] We'll just keep on reading. But he but
[56:35] he answered and said, "Every plant which
[56:37] my father hath not planted shall be
[56:39] rooted up. Let them alone. They be blind
[56:43] leaders of the blind. If the blind lead
[56:45] the blind, both shall fall in the
[56:47] ditch." Then answered Peter and said
[56:50] unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
[56:53] And Jesus said, "Are ye yet without
[56:55] understanding?
[56:57] Do you not understand that whatsoever
[56:59] enterth into the mouth goeth into the
[57:01] belly is is cast out into the drought?"
[57:04] But those things which proceed out of
[57:07] the mouth come forth from the heart and
[57:09] they defile the man. For out of the
[57:14] heart proceeds
[57:17] evil thoughts. So out of the inside that
[57:20] no one knows, no one can see. out of the
[57:23] heart, the invisible realm has evil
[57:26] thoughts, murders, adulteries,
[57:29] fornication, theft, false witness,
[57:32] blasphemies.
[57:34] These are the things which defile a man.
[57:38] But to eat with unwashing hands defiles
[57:41] not uh defiles not the man. So, so when
[57:45] we when we look here and and we see you
[57:49] you you you we are y'all understanding
[57:52] where where my point is here tonight.
[57:54] So, I want it's so important that our
[57:58] hearts are always pure and not just pure
[58:03] the way we think. Oh, I love God. I Oh,
[58:07] I serve God. So does the whole world.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; We want to do it. Amen. We want to do
[58:15] it. There's there's only one kind of
[58:16] Christianity. There's not the Baptist
[58:19] Christianity and the Methodist
[58:20] Christianity and the message Christian.
[58:22] There's only one Christianity.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's the Holy Spirit
[58:31] coming and living his life.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that just wonderful?
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Now, now I I I think I think those
[58:39] things are are are wonderful. Now the
[58:41] the Proverbs 22:11 says he that loves
[58:44] puress of heart
[58:48] uh for his for the grace of his lips the
[58:50] king shall be his friend. That's not the
[58:52] one I was looking for. Proverbs 4 and23
[58:54] is the one I was looking for. Keep thy
[58:56] heart with all diligence for out of it
[58:59] are the issues of life. Put away the
[59:00] forward mouth and perverse lips put far
[59:03] from thee. Matthew 5:8 blessed are the
[59:07] pure in heart for they shall see God.
[59:09] Uh, Titus 1:15, "Unto the pure all
[59:12] things are pure, but unto them that are
[59:14] defiled, and unbelieving is nothing
[59:17] pure, but even their mind and conscience
[59:20] is defiled."
[59:22] Amen.
[59:24] Now,
[59:26] Brother Brandham would he would preach a
[59:29] couple of services, amen, on the broken
[59:32] sistns.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he would take this scripture
[59:36] here in Jeremiah 2:12. And this is what
[59:39] I want us to deal with for just a few
[59:41] moments here. He says, "Be astonished,
[59:44] oh ye heavens." Uh Jeremiah 2:12
[59:48] a at this and be horribly afraid. Be ye
[59:52] very desolate, sayeth the Lord. For my
[59:55] people have committed two evils.
[59:58] They have forsaken the fountain of
[1:00:00] living waters and hewed them out sistns,
[1:00:04] broken sistns that can hold no water.
[1:00:07] Now, how many knows what a sistern is?
[1:00:10] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, you old-timers
[1:00:13] probably remember the sistns uh and they
[1:00:16] and and um so you girls that that that
[1:00:19] that go over there to u uh uh uh that
[1:00:24] have that have stayed over there at
[1:00:26] Suzan's, have y'all noticed her little
[1:00:28] tanks that that she's got u where it
[1:00:31] comes she she's got this as you're going
[1:00:32] in her back porch and she's and she's
[1:00:34] got her she's got gutters and everything
[1:00:37] and it goes into these little tanks and
[1:00:39] then now these are closed tanks and then
[1:00:42] she uses uses them for for irrigation
[1:00:44] and things of that nature. Well, in the
[1:00:46] old days, Amen. What they would do is
[1:00:48] they they had these kind of they had
[1:00:50] these uh uh they would take them from
[1:00:53] off the barn. Uh they they would run
[1:00:55] these pipes from the barn, from the
[1:00:57] houses, from uh from the different
[1:00:58] places. And when it rained, they would
[1:01:01] they would have these big open tanks.
[1:01:03] These tanks would just be all over. And
[1:01:05] so the water would all come in in there.
[1:01:07] That's a sistern. and and after and it
[1:01:10] was you know they they could use the
[1:01:12] water for for certain things just tried
[1:01:14] to conserve but the thing is the water
[1:01:16] wasn't living. So the water would sit
[1:01:19] there and become stagnant
[1:01:22] and and then before you know it, little
[1:01:25] wiggle tails, what uh tadpoles, little
[1:01:28] little before you know it, you getting
[1:01:30] you're getting that you're getting all
[1:01:31] of that that that uh that scum there
[1:01:34] along the bottom of that what what do
[1:01:35] you uh um uh that moss that moss growing
[1:01:39] on the bottom and before you know it,
[1:01:40] you're getting all of this trash in in
[1:01:43] the deal. Amen. Now,
[1:01:47] so brother brother Brandham is is
[1:01:50] talking about the sistern compared to
[1:01:53] the living water. And and there in
[1:01:55] Jeremiah, he's saying, "You've got a
[1:01:58] living well. You've got Jesus. You've
[1:02:01] got God right there, but yet you're
[1:02:04] drinking you're drinking the old scummy
[1:02:07] stuff."
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay, I can tell you guys
[1:02:11] don't understand. All right. You've got
[1:02:14] the message and you've got the tapes and
[1:02:18] you've got the church services and
[1:02:21] you're drinking from those apps on your
[1:02:24] phone
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; and you're drinking Amen. from this
[1:02:29] stuff. Amen. That that's that's
[1:02:31] polluting the world and taking people to
[1:02:35] hell. And you're drinking from that
[1:02:38] stuff. You've got the living
[1:02:42] and you are looking at the 17 magazine
[1:02:46] and you're looking at the fashions of
[1:02:49] the world and you're
[1:02:52] are you still not understanding? You've
[1:02:54] got a church with living waters
[1:02:59] and you're refusing that and you're
[1:03:02] satisfying
[1:03:04] your thirst.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Am I doing good or are you guys just
[1:03:15] really listening to me tonight?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:21] You drink that too long.
[1:03:25] Hallelujah.
[1:03:28] But we've got this.
[1:03:31] God come in this generation. There is an
[1:03:33] anointing upon this generation to
[1:03:36] overcome every power of hell.
[1:03:39] This message has everything we need for
[1:03:42] every boy, every girl.
[1:03:46] And you're never going to overcome
[1:03:48] pornography. But with mind over matter,
[1:03:52] you're never going to overcome
[1:03:53] attitudes. Amen. Mind over matter. I I I
[1:03:57] I know. I I know. I always hit, you
[1:03:59] know, a certain things. I I I I I I I
[1:04:02] use church services, skipping church
[1:04:03] services, and I use pornography. I But
[1:04:05] but but but I I'm wanting and and
[1:04:07] they're both sins. They're both sins.
[1:04:09] You've got to put God number one in your
[1:04:10] life. That's what the prophet said. If
[1:04:12] you've got the living water, you're
[1:04:14] going to be at church every service. The
[1:04:15] door is open. It's what he says. Amen.
[1:04:18] now and you and there ain't no oxes and
[1:04:20] ditches. You just do what the Bible says
[1:04:23] and and we don't and we don't play with
[1:04:25] pornography. We don't play with that
[1:04:28] stuff. Now, I you know, so those those
[1:04:31] are two things that are just very
[1:04:32] common. But but you you if you've got
[1:04:36] the Holy Spirit, if if if if you've if
[1:04:39] you've got the Holy Spirit within you,
[1:04:41] you know that gossiping is wrong.
[1:04:44] You know that tattling and talking about
[1:04:46] your brother and your neighbor is wrong.
[1:04:49] You know, amen. Treating your wife wrong
[1:04:53] uh uh uh you know uh anything less
[1:04:56] treating your wife anything less than
[1:04:59] your best friend is absolutely wrong.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Treating your husband anything less than
[1:05:06] being your lord,
[1:05:09] being your head.
[1:05:11] Oh, we can't use that anymore because
[1:05:13] no, women's rights.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; You going to be that or you gonna be
[1:05:18] this?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Stagnant waters is not going to produce
[1:05:22] a rapture. It's living waters.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, we got we got to
[1:05:29] take these things and and we know what
[1:05:32] the Bible says because we listen to
[1:05:34] messages and we do those things and and
[1:05:36] that's the reason why. Amen. But but so
[1:05:38] when I when I when I might hit and I and
[1:05:41] I I that there are these spirits that
[1:05:43] are behind certain things. And the
[1:05:47] bottom line is this. The bottom line,
[1:05:50] number one, the rapture is only for
[1:05:54] people.
[1:05:59] This will not be raptured.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; This will not be raptured.
[1:06:06] all of my quotes.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; The only one that's going to be raptured
[1:06:12] will be you
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; and you
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; and Gam. The only ones that's going to
[1:06:20] be raptured are people.
[1:06:22] And God's given us the safeguards of
[1:06:26] family. So, when you've got a mama and a
[1:06:29] daddy that is raising you in the ways of
[1:06:32] the Lord, where is Satan going to fight?
[1:06:36] He wants to stop the next generation. He
[1:06:39] wants Mary and Kobe to be the last in
[1:06:42] their in their family. Want y'all to be
[1:06:44] the last of that generation.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; He don't want you
[1:06:49] uh Aaron uh getting married and and
[1:06:52] serving the Lord and raising your
[1:06:54] children with fire and vi and v. Now, he
[1:06:57] don't mind you being religious. He won't
[1:06:58] even mind you being in the message as
[1:07:01] long as you don't listen to what the
[1:07:02] prophet says. Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] Amen. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Satan won't don't mind y'all being here
[1:07:10] sitting on these pews as long as you
[1:07:12] don't believe what the prophet is
[1:07:13] saying.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; But the prophet, if he ever said
[1:07:17] anything, he did say just one word.
[1:07:22] Misplaced.
[1:07:28] It comes down to Lord, I want to keep
[1:07:31] that life in my heart.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; It must be.
[1:07:37] Hallelujah. And it's really it's really
[1:07:40] an easy thing to do and that's just to
[1:07:42] surrender to the Lord and saying, "Lord,
[1:07:45] I'm going to surrender everything I've
[1:07:47] got. I want you to just
[1:07:50] I mind over matter ain't going to fix
[1:07:52] me. Mind over matter is not going to fix
[1:07:54] me. I need you to to to open the wells
[1:07:58] of eternal life from the inside of me
[1:08:01] and just bubble out. And that's that
[1:08:03] that's where true there there's where
[1:08:05] true sanctification comes from. It just
[1:08:07] bubbles things out. Hallelujah. It keeps
[1:08:09] things Can you say amen?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So So the purity of
[1:08:14] heart, Amen. can only come can only come
[1:08:18] through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:08:20] So, so the old system, it's that old
[1:08:23] man-made tank. It's it can be above
[1:08:25] ground or under the ground, and it
[1:08:27] depends solely upon the rain, and it
[1:08:29] runs from the roof of the barn and the
[1:08:31] house and down into a trough and then
[1:08:34] down into then into the tank and washes
[1:08:37] the filth from the roof into it. And and
[1:08:40] in the old days, the barn was twice as
[1:08:42] big as the house. And it and they
[1:08:43] navigated the rain that fell off the
[1:08:45] roof to the sistern and all of the
[1:08:47] manure dust and the chicken poop dust
[1:08:51] and and and everything else all washed
[1:08:54] into that sistern and the water would
[1:08:56] sit there and stagnate and scum up and
[1:08:58] wiggle and which mosquito larva and
[1:09:01] tadpoles that's where they thrive. But
[1:09:04] the artisian well is an underground
[1:09:07] spring which is under pressure and many
[1:09:10] produce uh hundreds of gallons of water
[1:09:13] per minute. The pressure must have have
[1:09:16] a releasing point. The water will be
[1:09:19] bubbling up out of that rock. Many times
[1:09:22] it'll shoot way up in the air. Why?
[1:09:25] Because the water has pressure behind
[1:09:28] it. And I just want to tell you God is
[1:09:30] eternal. Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:09:34] You see, isn't that just beautiful?
[1:09:36] Amen. So, the prophet would say,
[1:09:37] "Denominations make stagnant pools where
[1:09:40] men can live with women and women can
[1:09:43] carry on and cut their hair and wear
[1:09:45] shorts and anything else and call
[1:09:47] themselves Christian." But a genuine
[1:09:49] fountain, hallelujah, of the power of
[1:09:51] God, it can't stay there because it
[1:09:55] pushes it out. I am the fountain of
[1:09:58] living water. They left me. They left me
[1:10:01] to dig themselves some sistns. Now, a
[1:10:03] fountain of living water, we find out.
[1:10:05] What is the fountain of living water? We
[1:10:07] find out what the sistern is. Now, what
[1:10:09] is the fountain of living water? It's an
[1:10:11] artisian well. And what is an artisian
[1:10:13] well? Amen. It it's a well that that's
[1:10:16] always comes from beneath and pushes its
[1:10:18] way out. It's flowing all the time. It's
[1:10:21] self-supporting, always fresh, always
[1:10:24] clean. An artisian well, a fountain of
[1:10:26] living water. not it's not dead and
[1:10:30] stagnant. It's living. It's constantly
[1:10:32] changing, bringing up something new all
[1:10:35] the time. It's moving on, coming from
[1:10:37] its resources, and it draws its uh its
[1:10:40] resources from its bed. And still a
[1:10:42] fountain of living waters spraying up,
[1:10:45] self-cleansing. It cleans. It's pure.
[1:10:48] It's cleaning cleansing water. It's
[1:10:51] self-supporting. You don't have to wait
[1:10:53] for the rains till uh to to fill its
[1:10:55] tanks. It's always bubbling up and it
[1:10:59] gives its water free. Someone shout
[1:11:01] hallelujah. You don't have to pump it.
[1:11:04] You don't have to wind it. You don't
[1:11:05] have to twist it. You don't have to join
[1:11:08] it. It just a fountain of living waters.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:16] Praise the Lord. We were over in Still
[1:11:18] Water and and um uh and and some of the
[1:11:22] some of the kids were there and and and
[1:11:24] they were they were trying to get the
[1:11:25] old the old pump to work. You know, they
[1:11:27] had one of those pumps out there out
[1:11:29] there by the OSU the gardens there and
[1:11:31] and you had to and you had to pump.
[1:11:33] Well, they had a tank. They had the old
[1:11:35] tank and and you have and so when
[1:11:37] Brother Brand was talking about you
[1:11:38] don't have to pump it, that's the way
[1:11:39] you used to get your water. You'd have
[1:11:41] to you pump pump and a little bit of
[1:11:44] water come out. Sort of like we do with
[1:11:46] those water jugs
[1:11:48] and to get water to come. But this here
[1:11:50] you pumped and you pumped and you pumped
[1:11:51] and you pumped and a little bit of water
[1:11:53] would come out. What's it doing? It's
[1:11:55] bringing it out from a tank. The tank is
[1:11:57] is is somewhere else. It's it's got it's
[1:11:59] got all that bad water, all that
[1:12:01] stagnant water. And that's the reason I
[1:12:03] told you kids, don't be drinking from
[1:12:06] that because that ain't that ain't good
[1:12:08] stuff that's coming out, right? So, so
[1:12:11] what we've got God, we don't come to
[1:12:13] church to get pumped up. Well, amen,
[1:12:16] man. I hope the song leader gets us
[1:12:19] going tonight. Amen. Or I hope I hope
[1:12:21] Oh, I hope this ain't a dry service. How
[1:12:24] can it be a dry service when you've got
[1:12:26] a well of living water?
[1:12:30] Now, if you if you ain't got no water
[1:12:33] bubbling up until you come to church,
[1:12:36] we've got problems.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But God's want this to
[1:12:40] be bubbling up. It's something that's
[1:12:42] just bubbling on the inside of us. And
[1:12:44] there's where prayer life comes in. Let
[1:12:45] me deal with this for just a moment.
[1:12:47] Prayer life is just so important. Prayer
[1:12:50] life is is almost a thing of the past to
[1:12:52] be honest. Amen. To to where Amen. and
[1:12:56] and and uh to to to where it's it's not
[1:12:59] preached about, it's not talked about,
[1:13:01] it's not it's it's not uh uh you you
[1:13:05] can't you can't get people here to
[1:13:07] church. I I I remember I I I remember
[1:13:10] this church right here. We used to all
[1:13:12] come and uh uh uh early for church and
[1:13:15] our prayer before service sometimes
[1:13:17] would just rock the rafters.
[1:13:20] But see, then we get more in tune with
[1:13:22] the message. Oh, we're not supposed to
[1:13:24] talk. We're not supposed to pray. We're
[1:13:26] not supposed to. We just think our
[1:13:27] prayers. I You know what happened to to
[1:13:30] just praying? Just just a real prayer.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Now, now we're not talking about some
[1:13:38] some some guy that's trying to make all
[1:13:40] kinds of noise and acting spiritual, but
[1:13:43] we're talking about an earnest
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; talk with God.
[1:13:48] Amen. That that kind that kind of prayer
[1:13:49] will never hurt any service.
[1:13:53] That kind of prayer will never hurt
[1:13:54] anything because there is something
[1:13:56] there and it didn't hurt anything for
[1:13:58] brother Brandham where the glory of the
[1:14:00] Lord would come and move and and but but
[1:14:02] the thing is amen sometimes us as elders
[1:14:05] I'm preaching to us elders now sometimes
[1:14:07] we we think well now we're more
[1:14:09] dignified or we've learned more and now
[1:14:11] we've got until the Holy Spirit is no
[1:14:14] longer bubbling up and our prayer we're
[1:14:16] no longer looking forward to that prayer
[1:14:18] the way we used to look forward to that
[1:14:20] prayer but I just want to tell you
[1:14:21] Things haven't really changed.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Well, no, things have not changed with
[1:14:25] God. God is still the artisian well.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; God is still the artisian well. And and
[1:14:32] I'm telling you that relationship with
[1:14:34] the Lord and that prayer, that prayer
[1:14:35] life can be wonderful. And I want to
[1:14:37] tell you what God done for me when I was
[1:14:39] a kid. I I I I look forward to coming
[1:14:42] down and praying. I I I I I look forward
[1:14:45] to those times. Amen.
[1:14:48] you know, I whether coming down to the
[1:14:50] church or or just going off uh there in
[1:14:53] Kinwood, we were sort of uh you know,
[1:14:55] being a small I would I would just take
[1:14:57] off down the road just just a little
[1:15:00] ways from the house and I I would just
[1:15:02] go talk to the Lord, set out there on a
[1:15:04] tree stump somewhere and just talking to
[1:15:06] God and let his presence come down and
[1:15:08] and and and move upon me and and and
[1:15:11] bring me to tears and I I'm weeping in
[1:15:14] his presence. I I'm telling you, if you
[1:15:17] want that kind of relationship with God,
[1:15:20] you can have that kind of relationship.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; But it's going to require coming into
[1:15:26] his presence and that and that and that
[1:15:29] and that inner something saying, "Lord,
[1:15:34] I want the freshness of your Holy
[1:15:36] Spirit."
[1:15:38] Oh, how many wants that?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; I I I want that. How many of you elders
[1:15:45] How many of you elders know that you
[1:15:46] have to be renewed from time to time?
[1:15:48] And it's not the artisian well, but just
[1:15:50] sometimes we get something that we got
[1:15:53] something that's just blocking the path.
[1:15:55] Hallelujah. But the Holy Spirit, Amen.
[1:15:58] If you just give him charge that it it's
[1:16:00] going to blow that trash, whatever it
[1:16:01] is, it's going to blow it right out of
[1:16:03] your life. He'll do it.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He'll do it. He'll do it. Amen. But we
[1:16:08] allow things sometimes. But I'm here to
[1:16:10] tell you, I say tonight, let's just
[1:16:12] let's just let's just let's just unstopp
[1:16:14] the well. Let's unstopp the well. Let's
[1:16:18] let the grace of God Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[1:16:21] come on now. Amen. Where the glory of
[1:16:24] the Lord Amen. And and when you and when
[1:16:26] you when you talk about it, Amen. Uh uh
[1:16:29] uh uh he he says it it needs no strainer
[1:16:32] on it. It takes it takes all the
[1:16:34] parasites out for it's coming so deep
[1:16:37] down there in the rock until there's no
[1:16:40] parasites there. I it don't know of any
[1:16:42] educational rag hanging on it. That's
[1:16:45] right. The old worldly man worldly made
[1:16:48] system of man-made denominational wisdom
[1:16:50] to tell you before a psychiatrist
[1:16:52] whether you'd be able to preach or not.
[1:16:54] And and and I it don't have one of those
[1:16:56] filthy rags hanging on it. Amen. What
[1:16:58] he's talking about the rags is they used
[1:17:00] to have to take they they would take a
[1:17:02] rag and they would use it as a filter.
[1:17:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:17:09] Filter. This is what this this is
[1:17:11] basically what that what it would do.
[1:17:13] Hallelujah. So you take the filter.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:20] And then the the water in the filter
[1:17:22] then you you put that in your in your in
[1:17:24] your bottle water to drink. Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] And so there so you ain't got the
[1:17:29] seaweed in there.
[1:17:33] You want to drink that.
[1:17:36] See, and that's what that's what
[1:17:38] churches do. They do the filter. Well,
[1:17:40] you're okay. God still loves you. You
[1:17:42] know, it's okay. You're going to be what
[1:17:43] you got to be, but hallelujah. At least
[1:17:46] you're coming to church and paying your
[1:17:48] tithes and and God God will accept that.
[1:17:51] Will God accept that? Does God want that
[1:17:53] kind of a drink?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; God don't want that kind of a drink. So,
[1:17:56] we don't want no rags filtering nothing.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; It's filthy. It's filthy. It's filthy.
[1:18:04] We don't want that. But, Brother
[1:18:06] Brandham says God wants some fresh
[1:18:10] Pentecostal water.
[1:18:13] Now, now this is going to be my last
[1:18:14] this this this is where I'm coming into
[1:18:16] prayer. This is where I'm coming in our
[1:18:17] relationship with the Lord. Just give me
[1:18:18] another five minutes. This is this is
[1:18:20] where we're at. Brother Brandham says
[1:18:24] we are we are giving God
[1:18:28] this stuff to drink.
[1:18:33] He says God wants this stuff to drink.
[1:18:38] Your praise is either going to be this
[1:18:40] stuff or this stuff. It's going to be
[1:18:45] so full of the world, so full of this,
[1:18:46] so full of that, so full of this. You
[1:18:48] come to church and just
[1:18:53] There ain't no artisian well behind it.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; There's no life behind it. God's wanting
[1:18:59] drink
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; out of the purity that he placed inside
[1:19:05] of us.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Are y'all hearing me tonight?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; See, let's let's let's let's look let's
[1:19:11] let's listen to brother Brandham here
[1:19:13] and I and and then we'll then we'll
[1:19:15] we'll see what we got.
[1:19:18] Hallelujah. He said, "How could how
[1:19:20] could you get a fresh drink out of a
[1:19:22] stagnated sister?" Uh when a person goes
[1:19:24] to a stagnated sister to get a drink, an
[1:19:26] artisian well, when there's an artisian
[1:19:28] well, there's something wrong with that
[1:19:29] man's mind. And and if a woman or man
[1:19:31] goes to church or goes to such a place
[1:19:34] for to find comfort and there is
[1:19:36] something spiritually wrong with that
[1:19:37] person. They don't want the word, it
[1:19:39] shows that their nature is still a frog
[1:19:41] or a tadpole or something. That's right.
[1:19:43] something of that nature that likes that
[1:19:46] stagnant pool because because them kind
[1:19:50] of things won't live in a fresh in a
[1:19:54] fresh water pool. Amen. You can't do it.
[1:19:58] And so he he he goes on and and he and
[1:20:02] he says u
[1:20:05] he said, "I'm going to close in in the
[1:20:06] Lord in five minutes and and um uh uh uh
[1:20:10] uh uh let me let me set this up. Let me
[1:20:12] set this up." So, so this is in um the
[1:20:17] uh uh why why little Bethlehem? So,
[1:20:19] Brother Brandham was saying they're
[1:20:21] coming when when David was was was
[1:20:25] um was garrisoned when Saul was after
[1:20:28] him and then the Philistines had him had
[1:20:30] him blocked away from the old well, the
[1:20:33] well that he used to go to the artisian
[1:20:36] well that would come and he would come
[1:20:38] and drink from it. Well, he had been
[1:20:39] running away and he had been captive for
[1:20:41] so long and and and and and
[1:20:44] the enemy or not captive, but the enemy
[1:20:46] had had been running after him and it it
[1:20:48] was just it was just he was in a battle
[1:20:50] and he and the Bible says that David
[1:20:53] looked was on the hill and he looked
[1:20:55] down into Bethlehem and he said, "Oh,
[1:20:59] for a drink, just a drink
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; out of the well in Bethlehem.
[1:21:07] Oh, for a drink. There were three mighty
[1:21:10] men of David. There were three men that
[1:21:13] heard him saying this in his heart. Oh,
[1:21:16] for a drink. And the prophet said his
[1:21:19] desire was their command.
[1:21:23] They grabbed up a pale. One grabbed a
[1:21:26] pale and the other took their swords.
[1:21:28] And the B and and and brother Brandham
[1:21:30] says that from that hill they had to go
[1:21:32] down in one place he said 15 miles.
[1:21:36] 15 miles over down there. They fought
[1:21:40] all of those Philistines that were
[1:21:42] garrisoned around the well. They were
[1:21:44] blocking the well so that Israel could
[1:21:47] not have it. And here these three men,
[1:21:51] one's got the pale and and the other two
[1:21:54] has got the swords. They are fighting
[1:21:57] all of those Philistines 15 miles and
[1:22:01] they come up. Hallelujah. I want that is
[1:22:04] splashing a little bit. Amen.
[1:22:07] Hallelujah. They come up.
[1:22:17] So they they they get them they get them
[1:22:19] some water. Hallelujah.
[1:22:22] And then they fight their way all the
[1:22:24] way back. Now, anybody knows that when
[1:22:26] you get a pale of water and you're just
[1:22:28] going just Amen. from here to there,
[1:22:30] you're going to lose most of your water.
[1:22:32] How about 15 miles? Okay. So maybe when
[1:22:35] they got there, all they brought to
[1:22:38] David was a drink.
[1:22:41] Okay. They get over there and David is
[1:22:46] so moved that these men would go to that
[1:22:50] artisian well to bring him water.
[1:22:54] You know what he done?
[1:22:57] You You boys know what he done? Go
[1:22:59] ahead. Huh? He poured it out. Why did he
[1:23:02] pour it out?
[1:23:12] He poured it out as a drink offering to
[1:23:16] the Lord. He saw those men were willing
[1:23:20] to put their life in jeopardy for him.
[1:23:25] He was so thankful that that water
[1:23:27] becomes sacred.
[1:23:29] It wasn't that he that would be a slap
[1:23:32] to their face, him pouring out those
[1:23:33] three guys says, "So help me."
[1:23:39] He poured it on the ground as a drink
[1:23:42] offering.
[1:23:44] A drink offering to God. You're the only
[1:23:46] one worthy of this this sacrifice.
[1:23:49] You're the only one worthy. And he
[1:23:52] offered it. He offered his drink to the
[1:23:55] Lord.
[1:23:58] Now watch brother now brother Brandham
[1:24:00] is now we're breaking in. He says he
[1:24:03] says notice a warrior sons you men here
[1:24:07] that claim to be to to to be sons. Did
[1:24:10] you know that David what David
[1:24:12] represented? David represented Christ.
[1:24:15] He was Christ the son of David. Now,
[1:24:18] now, now listen, those warrior, gentile
[1:24:22] warriors, many of them, notice, they
[1:24:25] they come from everywhere.
[1:24:28] But they know that fugitive was
[1:24:30] anointed. They knew David was rejected
[1:24:33] by his own people.
[1:24:36] They know the anointing was upon him.
[1:24:39] They could see it. They stood right by
[1:24:42] his side. Die or live. They were gallant
[1:24:44] men. No matter how much the outside
[1:24:47] world didn't believe it, his own people
[1:24:50] kicked him out. Amen. They didn't they
[1:24:52] didn't want nothing to do with him. Saul
[1:24:55] run him out. The head of the
[1:24:56] denomination kicked him out. They had
[1:24:58] nothing to do with it. The council
[1:25:00] kicked him out and he become a fugitive
[1:25:03] and he and he had to go uh uh to to
[1:25:05] wherever he could. There he was in the
[1:25:08] mountains and there was a little group
[1:25:10] of men of Gentiles so forth made up. And
[1:25:12] they looked at that man and they knowed
[1:25:15] he was coming. He was the coming king.
[1:25:18] So it is today that the real gallant
[1:25:19] soldiers of the faith of that word who
[1:25:22] knows the prom. The word promises. Amen.
[1:25:25] The word promises that Jesus Christ will
[1:25:27] return. We ain't interested in millions
[1:25:29] of dollars of this and millions of
[1:25:31] dollars of that. I'm interested in the
[1:25:33] return of Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus. I
[1:25:36] warriors warrior sons of God. What's the
[1:25:39] matter with you? How how do you stand
[1:25:41] today when we see the Bible predicts
[1:25:44] he's a fugitive today? He's been turned
[1:25:46] out by his church, turned out of the
[1:25:48] organizations. You know it. You no need
[1:25:51] of hiding around about it. It's the
[1:25:53] truth. The Bible says it would be that
[1:25:55] way. Come out from them marks of the
[1:25:58] beast. Look at these men. They pulled
[1:26:00] their swords. What was it? His desire
[1:26:04] was a drink of cold water. David, what a
[1:26:07] type of today. our David Christ. Can
[1:26:10] someone shout hallelujah?
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; We know he's we we know he's called a
[1:26:16] holy ruler. He's cast off to one side, a
[1:26:18] fanatic of everything, rejected by the
[1:26:20] churches. And we know who Jesus is. It's
[1:26:22] the word, right? They've called they've
[1:26:25] got their creeds and things drawn up in
[1:26:27] this Christmas like they did the first
[1:26:29] one. We know that. But we know that this
[1:26:32] word ever remains true. It's got to be
[1:26:34] fulfilled. And the desire of Christ is
[1:26:36] for men, warriors, to stand. Amen. Oh,
[1:26:39] come stand with me. Stand by my side.
[1:26:42] I'm standing in a terrible place. I
[1:26:44] challenge today. These tapes go all over
[1:26:47] the world. I challenge some man, some
[1:26:50] warrior who loves Jesus Christ that
[1:26:52] knows that these things has got to be
[1:26:54] fulfilled today. Brethren, come stand by
[1:26:57] my side. Pull the word of God. Forget
[1:27:01] those dried sistns, stagnated
[1:27:04] denominations you're living in, and pull
[1:27:06] the fresh word of God. Let's give Jesus
[1:27:10] a good drink of fresh Pentecostal water.
[1:27:13] That's his desire today. Back to the
[1:27:16] original Pentecost, back to the word.
[1:27:19] It's prophesied we'd do so in Malachi
[1:27:21] the 4th chapter. Return the faith of the
[1:27:23] children back to the fathers again. Who
[1:27:25] would stand this morning like David? We
[1:27:28] know David is coming into power. Jesus
[1:27:31] Christ is going to take the world. Amen.
[1:27:34] He inherits the earth. He's going to be
[1:27:36] the king over the earth. He's rejected
[1:27:38] today. He's a fugitive among his people.
[1:27:41] Of course, he's a fugitive to the world.
[1:27:43] Always was. But today, he's a fugitive
[1:27:46] in his own church. They've rejected him.
[1:27:48] They love their creeds and big
[1:27:51] dignitaries over there in that pool over
[1:27:53] there instead of the word. They won't
[1:27:56] let it be manifested. They won't let it
[1:27:58] be preached in its power. They've cut
[1:28:00] away from it just like the Bible said
[1:28:03] they had do in Revelation 17. What are
[1:28:05] they doing? Going up here today all
[1:28:08] going into the council of churches.
[1:28:10] Catholicism and Protestantism uniting
[1:28:12] together. Mark making the mark and the
[1:28:15] image of the beast. Protestants falling
[1:28:17] right for it. Pentecostals everywhere.
[1:28:19] Dignitaries going into Rome from Rome or
[1:28:22] from Pentecost coming back. Amen. in the
[1:28:24] most spiritual place in in a in Texas
[1:28:27] and everywhere. They're opening up and
[1:28:28] giving understanding of the of the
[1:28:30] stations and so forth, knowing that
[1:28:32] that's creed that's been rejected uh
[1:28:35] that's rejected this word. But oh, you
[1:28:38] Bethlehem dwellers. Hallelujah. I call
[1:28:41] for men, warriors who's not afraid. I
[1:28:44] don't care if there's 800 standing on
[1:28:46] one side and 10,000 on another. I want
[1:28:50] warriors who will come with me and cut a
[1:28:53] hole through that line of unbelieving
[1:28:55] Philistines, the world council as God
[1:28:58] garrisoned around the word of God trying
[1:29:01] to make it creeds and feed the people.
[1:29:03] There's a well, there's a fountain open
[1:29:07] in the house of David, Bethlehem for the
[1:29:10] sin and uncleanliness. Brother, sin is
[1:29:13] unbelief in his word. Who warrior that
[1:29:16] can see the millennium coming? What
[1:29:19] warrior can see the great Holy Spirit
[1:29:21] come in the form of Jesus Christ, the
[1:29:23] literal body of Christ, to take over
[1:29:25] again? Stand with me. Stand by me. Let's
[1:29:29] Let's cut a hole through the
[1:29:30] denominational creed. Let's get in
[1:29:32] there. He's crying for a fresh drink of
[1:29:35] Pentecostal water. The original
[1:29:37] Pentecost, not a bunch of caring on and
[1:29:39] screaming and hollering. I mean, a
[1:29:41] genuine Holy Ghost baptism that produces
[1:29:44] the life of Jesus back into the person.
[1:29:46] Forgive me if I hurt you. No, you don't
[1:29:49] do it. I I I'm doing this in the name of
[1:29:51] the Lord Jesus. Come back. Stand. You
[1:29:54] gallant man who can see Jesus standing
[1:29:57] yonder. Jesus Christ is fugitive from
[1:30:00] his church, barred by out by his creeds.
[1:30:03] By their creeds, there's a fresh
[1:30:05] fountain hanging yonder. Amen. There's a
[1:30:08] power to make this word live again. Can
[1:30:10] I hear an amen? It's prophesied in this
[1:30:13] day to come to pass. God said it would
[1:30:17] come to pass. It's got to come to pass.
[1:30:19] You'll never do it in the army you're in
[1:30:21] right now. You've garrisoned yourself
[1:30:24] Pentecost right around the rest of the
[1:30:26] organization cutting into a creed. But
[1:30:29] oh man of God, where is that sword? Oh,
[1:30:32] our Lord desires a fresh drink. I don't
[1:30:36] care if it's life or death. Let's cut
[1:30:38] through this thing. It's so hard
[1:30:40] standing by yourself, but I'm calling
[1:30:42] for men to stand by me. Stand with the
[1:30:45] word with what that word says. Do it
[1:30:47] just the way the word said it. I don't
[1:30:50] care what anything else says. Stay it
[1:30:53] that way. For that's the only thing that
[1:30:56] will cut. Let's go to Bethlehem. The
[1:30:59] true water of God.
[1:31:03] Can I hear it? Amen.
[1:31:06] The real water of God. I want that well.
[1:31:09] I want the well back in. I I I I I want
[1:31:13] that well so bubbling up. I want the
[1:31:16] glory of the Lord so upon you youth.
[1:31:19] Amen. Kobe, when you're in your youth
[1:31:21] meetings, the glory of the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:24] That used to fall upon the youth when
[1:31:26] you guys were youth and and and and and
[1:31:28] you would get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:30] right there in your youth meetings. I I
[1:31:33] want the glory of the Lord with the
[1:31:35] power of God so moving that you can get
[1:31:38] filled with the Holy Ghost right there
[1:31:40] in your in your bedroom while you're
[1:31:42] praying. I believe God is not a
[1:31:45] respector of persons.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; It's what God's promised for this day.
[1:31:50] It's what he's promised. And then it
[1:31:52] won't be no no God God's not a God's
[1:31:56] God's not a he's not a cowboy. He's not
[1:32:00] one with a whip. Amen. And I last so
[1:32:03] God's a shepherd and my sheep know my
[1:32:06] voice. And that's what God is doing
[1:32:08] today. He's calling us. Do y'all hear
[1:32:10] the voice of God? Say, I I I want some
[1:32:13] good Pentecostal water. I want some
[1:32:15] water. What you see what I'm saying? The
[1:32:19] two it changes you. But then you become
[1:32:23] you become you become God's very own
[1:32:27] water. You become you're the word made
[1:32:30] flesh. So then you become the witness.
[1:32:32] And that's why I'm saying you guys don't
[1:32:34] forget. Don't forget you've got it's not
[1:32:37] just it's not just God cleaning your
[1:32:40] heart, but then you become that living
[1:32:43] witness to the generation. You become
[1:32:47] God's drink
[1:32:49] by living that life, by dressing the way
[1:32:52] you dress, by loving the way you the the
[1:32:55] acting the way you act. You become a
[1:32:59] waterer.
[1:33:02] You become a refreshment
[1:33:05] to God in this evil world.
[1:33:09] You become not just to the world. Mary,
[1:33:12] you're a refreshment to a lot of people.
[1:33:14] I've been I mean listen I the the the
[1:33:18] top the top dogs of Pony
[1:33:22] have told me there's just something
[1:33:24] about they don't they they talk about us
[1:33:27] guys too but they always go back to the
[1:33:29] women
[1:33:30] and you and and and and you wonder why
[1:33:33] they come back to you women they they're
[1:33:35] just their natures and their love and
[1:33:38] the way they dressed and the way they
[1:33:41] they it's just when they walk into the
[1:33:43] store or any business. It's not that you
[1:33:46] have the dress on. The dress is it's the
[1:33:49] water of life that is flowing out of
[1:33:52] you. You're dressing that way is because
[1:33:55] there's something that has happened in
[1:33:57] here.
[1:34:00] Can you say amen?
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; They see that. They see that. And I
[1:34:05] think it's so important because you
[1:34:07] girls do represent
[1:34:09] that kingdom.
[1:34:11] when God wanted to show the prophet,
[1:34:13] show show uh uh John, the prophet John
[1:34:17] the the new Jerusalem or or he says,
[1:34:20] "I'm gonna show you the bride." He said,
[1:34:22] "I'm going to show you the lamb's wife,
[1:34:24] the bride," he connected it with the new
[1:34:26] Jerusalem. Anytime that God wanted to
[1:34:28] show what heaven was going to look like,
[1:34:30] he showed him a woman.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. When God wanted
[1:34:36] to Are you hearing me? When God wanted
[1:34:39] to talk about his church there in in in
[1:34:42] Ephesians 5, Amen. What did he do? He
[1:34:45] talks about a man and his wife and how a
[1:34:48] wife loves her husband and how a man
[1:34:51] gives himself for his wife. He says,
[1:34:54] "Oh, I'm talking about you two, but I'm
[1:34:56] not really I'm using you two as an
[1:34:58] example, but I'm really talking about
[1:35:00] the church." He's using the woman to
[1:35:03] describe the church. when you dress,
[1:35:06] act, when you live your life the way
[1:35:10] God's called you to be, especially you
[1:35:12] women. Amen. Because as I say, you there
[1:35:14] there's something about those qualities
[1:35:16] that you have. It it it it is a it is a
[1:35:20] sign that Christ is on the earth, but
[1:35:24] it's also a refreshment to the Lord.
[1:35:27] Brothers, you're the same way now. Amen.
[1:35:29] Now you you you you you know it's not
[1:35:31] not quite as noticeable in your life as
[1:35:33] it is for the ladies because the ladies
[1:35:35] the womanhood is just totally lost these
[1:35:37] days. Amen. But but a a true genuine
[1:35:40] lady when when when they're standing I
[1:35:42] mean they you you ladies just stand out
[1:35:44] right now. Us guys we still wear Amen.
[1:35:47] But we can wear our britches up where
[1:35:49] they belong
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and we don't have to go through the
[1:35:52] fads. Amen. Now the molliks are coming
[1:35:55] out. So now everyone's wanting to go
[1:35:56] back to the mollik. Amen. And you're not
[1:35:58] going to be wearing the mollik. Amen.
[1:36:00] You're you're going to you're going to
[1:36:01] be you're going to be living that life.
[1:36:03] It's a treasure. God wants fresh
[1:36:07] Pentecostal water. But again, I don't we
[1:36:10] don't we don't harp on this all the time
[1:36:12] because all we have to do is get this.
[1:36:15] And once this is in you, it begins to
[1:36:19] bubble out. And occasionally God says,
[1:36:20] "Hey, hey, hey."
[1:36:23] And we're quick to line up, right? Is
[1:36:24] that not what brother Brandham said in
[1:36:26] the vision? Amen. Right. At the very
[1:36:28] end, the the the the bride was getting
[1:36:31] was going off this way and going and
[1:36:33] getting out of step and he says, "Get
[1:36:35] back in line." Is that right? Well, who
[1:36:38] is it at the end?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Me and you.
[1:36:44] And so God's word brings us right back.
[1:36:46] What is it? It's the fountain of life.
[1:36:50] Well, can you say amen? Amen.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you here this evening. Amen.
[1:36:56] So I I I'm thankful that there is if any
[1:36:59] man if my words abide in you, you abide
[1:37:02] in me and my words abide in you, you can
[1:37:05] ask what you will and it shall be done.
[1:37:10] I am here to tell you that living water,
[1:37:14] that living water, hallelujah, that's
[1:37:16] come from an extension cord and uh and
[1:37:19] uh and and and whatever that pump is.
[1:37:22] Amen. But there's one that's bubbling
[1:37:24] out of us, and that's the Lord's eternal
[1:37:27] life bubbling out of us. Aren't you glad
[1:37:29] for that?
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:32] Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] Hallelujah. If the musicians would come,
[1:37:37] praise the name of the Lord. Praise the
[1:37:40] name of the Lord. God is so good to us.
[1:37:44] Hallelujah.
[1:37:46] Amen. Now, now did how' y'all like the
[1:37:49] visuals here?
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:37:56] now these this is just two pulls. But
[1:37:58] don't let this leave you. What are we
[1:38:00] going to be tonight,
[1:38:03] Devin? What are you going to be?
[1:38:07] You going to be this or you going to be
[1:38:10] this?
[1:38:11] Hallelujah.
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:18] What are you going to be,
[1:38:20] Aaron? What are you going to be?
[1:38:24] Where where where are you at?
[1:38:27] What do you want,
[1:38:29] Kylin?
[1:38:31] We're all born this way. We're all born
[1:38:33] this way. This You're born that way.
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:38] as good of a boy as you are, Simmy. As
[1:38:41] good of a boy as you are.
[1:38:43] Don't go on it, you guys are the best
[1:38:45] boys. I We got the best kids in all the
[1:38:48] world. I We do.
[1:38:53] But this is what we are in our old
[1:38:56] nature.
[1:38:59] This is what we are, Uriah. That's it.
[1:39:03] It's what's on the inside of you until
[1:39:07] the Lord comes in, begins to move.
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:15] You girls, as pretty as you are,
[1:39:18] until we get this, we've got this.
[1:39:22] Adults, if you don't have the baptism of
[1:39:24] the Holy Spirit,
[1:39:29] Brother Brandham used visuals, too,
[1:39:31] right?
[1:39:32] He used the visual. He used the visual
[1:39:34] of the heart with a snake in it.
[1:39:37] And then he used this with a heart with
[1:39:40] a with a dove in it.
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:49] Can't have it both ways.
[1:39:52] We want God's life in us.
[1:39:55] If there's someone here that don't want
[1:39:58] to be this way, but wants to be this. I
[1:40:01] don't know how it happens. I can't tell
[1:40:02] you how it happens, Mary. I can't.
[1:40:08] We know what God's done for us.
[1:40:13] But you can't explain it.
[1:40:16] I can't explain it.
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:24] It's supernatural. It's something that
[1:40:25] God does.
[1:40:27] One minute you're loving you're loving
[1:40:30] the world and sin and all your pot and
[1:40:34] drugs and
[1:40:37] and you come and you ask God,
[1:40:41] to clean you, to help you, and you want
[1:40:44] to live for him.
[1:40:48] And in a simple prayer,
[1:40:52] a simple prayer,
[1:40:55] you go from this
[1:40:58] to this.
[1:41:03] You say it happens just like that.
[1:41:06] It does.
[1:41:09] But many times and most the time it
[1:41:13] takes many trips,
[1:41:15] many hours at the altar dying out to
[1:41:18] ourel to get to the point of surrender
[1:41:22] so that he can make it.
[1:41:26] It's a free gift.
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] But we get this in our mind. Well, I got
[1:41:33] to do this. I got to I
[1:41:36] You've got to forget it all.
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:40] Well, what do I have? Do I Well, maybe
[1:41:42] I'll have to do this or maybe I'll have
[1:41:43] to quit. Do you want that? Do you want
[1:41:47] this
[1:41:48] this
[1:41:50] sess
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:55] or do you want eternal life?
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:02] I want eternal life.
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:19] My my
[1:42:23] my wife wasn't raised
[1:42:26] [Music]
[1:42:27] in the easiest of home.
[1:42:31] Her brother was a drug dealer.
[1:42:37] Ed was an alcoholic.
[1:42:42] Many men in and out of the house.
[1:42:47] But at 14 years old,
[1:42:50] when the gospel came
[1:42:53] to my wife's reservation, God changed
[1:42:56] her.
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:12] He took this took her old life,
[1:43:16] took the condition that she was raised
[1:43:18] in
[1:43:21] and he gave her a new one.
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:29] God took all the brokenness.
[1:43:33] And if he can do it for that 14year-old
[1:43:35] girl, well, my goodness, he can do it.
[1:43:37] He can do it for anybody.
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:41] Brokenness
[1:43:44] and he made something special.
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:48] It's a gift that is being offered
[1:43:49] tonight. He's saying, "Why?
[1:43:52] Why? Why? Why stick to this old nasty
[1:43:56] filthy system
[1:43:59] when I'm offering life?
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:06] It don't take too very often. It don't
[1:44:09] take too very long.
[1:44:13] For my wife,
[1:44:15] she said it was a no-brainer for me.
[1:44:19] I'd done seen all of the stuff. I'd done
[1:44:22] seen everything that sin had done in my
[1:44:24] family, but it had done.
[1:44:27] I was looking for something
[1:44:30] that was fresh,
[1:44:32] something that can touch me.
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:42] I
[1:44:46] I want to say that we can all look back.
[1:44:48] Tina, you can look back in your life.
[1:44:51] There was nothing back. There was
[1:44:53] nothing back there.
[1:44:55] All the brokenness. But God
[1:45:00] God's brought a living water
[1:45:04] bubbling out.
[1:45:08] It's not that you're perfect. It's not
[1:45:10] that you've already attained, but
[1:45:12] there's something within you that is
[1:45:15] that is screaming out to live like him
[1:45:17] and love him.
[1:45:20] If there's someone here tonight, as I
[1:45:23] unplugged it while ago and was just
[1:45:25] going to end the service, but the Lord
[1:45:27] don't want that.
[1:45:30] If there's someone here tonight
[1:45:34] that needs his presence,
[1:45:37] that needs his that I'm going to lean up
[1:45:39] against this this pullpit for a moment.

[1:45:45] His presence is here.
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:54] When we look and we we say, "Well, we've
[1:45:58] seen what sin done to mama,
[1:46:02] grandmama,
[1:46:04] maybe even great grandmama if you've
[1:46:05] lived long enough.
[1:46:08] But when God comes and says, "I want to
[1:46:10] give you life.
[1:46:13] I want to give you life where you'll
[1:46:15] have it abundantly and more abundantly.
[1:46:18] what your presence his his presence.
[1:46:20] Won't we just bow our heads here
[1:46:21] tonight?
[1:46:23] If the Lord is dealing with your heart,
[1:46:24] we're just going to we're not going to
[1:46:26] tear long, but if the Lord is dealing
[1:46:28] with somebody,
[1:46:30] if there's someone here that has not
[1:46:32] accepted Jesus and your you you you've
[1:46:34] come through the motion, but but you
[1:46:36] don't have that well of living water in
[1:46:39] your heart, why don't you let him do it
[1:46:41] tonight?
[1:46:44] Won't you let him do it?
[1:46:47] You don't have to worry about trying to
[1:46:49] be a Christian. All you have to do is
[1:46:50] just let the let the artisian well in
[1:46:52] there. It'll bubble everything that's
[1:46:54] not of him out there
[1:46:57] right now. Let his holy spirit.
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:02] If there's some of you young people that
[1:47:04] you can see yourself,
[1:47:07] you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:08] he he'll give it to you tonight.
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:13] Some of you's already got it, but maybe
[1:47:16] you've allowed things to come in that
[1:47:18] maybe it's hindering the well. Won't you
[1:47:21] just let God just unstopp it all
[1:47:22] tonight?
[1:47:24] Say, Lord, take it all from me.
[1:47:27] Father,
[1:47:31] as I feel your presence here lingering,
[1:47:33] and I I appreciate this audience here
[1:47:36] tonight, let me minister.
[1:47:40] I ask Lord Jesus
[1:47:44] that you would come to the point of need
[1:47:46] as
[1:47:48] your spirit is moving across this
[1:47:50] audience.
[1:47:53] you're touching lives
[1:47:57] and I'm asking Lord Jesus
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:02] that you would
[1:48:04] take every one of your children
[1:48:07] if there's a sinner here tonight
[1:48:10] that's
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:14] living in that stagnant life
[1:48:18] that cesspool of sin
[1:48:22] Lord Lord, take their heart as they
[1:48:24] surrender to you tonight.
[1:48:27] But I'm asking, Lord, that you would
[1:48:29] give them drink of that living water.
[1:48:33] It'll quench the thirst of their heart,
[1:48:35] their lives
[1:48:38] that'll make them
[1:48:43] such great
[1:48:47] children of yours. Give them a life of
[1:48:50] peace.
[1:48:52] Make them soul winners.
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:59] You take every one of these young men
[1:49:00] and women, Lord.
[1:49:03] May they walk with you.
[1:49:06] Won't be too many years and they'll be
[1:49:07] looking for spouses. And
[1:49:12] Lord, we want to make sure that
[1:49:15] even in these teenage years when the
[1:49:17] devil's fighting,
[1:49:19] Lord,
[1:49:21] I know there may be some that maybe the
[1:49:23] devil may be fighting even tonight that
[1:49:25] have the Holy Ghost. And Satan would
[1:49:28] tell them they don't.
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:34] But I also know that there are some
[1:49:35] that's the devil saying, "You've got the
[1:49:37] Holy Ghost." And they might not
[1:49:42] if that's something that's not that's
[1:49:44] something in their belly that's not if
[1:49:46] it's not bubbling up to do your will and
[1:49:48] your desires to to do your will.
[1:49:53] I'm asking that you would give it to
[1:49:54] them tonight, Lord.
[1:49:59] For they'll never be able to justify
[1:50:00] sin. They'll never be able to justify
[1:50:04] anything that is wrong.
[1:50:07] Help them, Lord.
[1:50:11] Bring every son and daughter to you.
[1:50:16] I ask, Lord, those that are watching on
[1:50:19] the internet that you would touch their
[1:50:20] hearts right now, Lord. Give them that
[1:50:23] well of living water as they repent,
[1:50:26] surrender their lives to you.
[1:50:30] I thank you for it.
[1:50:35] As an elder, Lord, I'm surrendering my
[1:50:38] life even more. I want to surrender
[1:50:41] everything I am in a greater manner. I
[1:50:43] want your love.
[1:50:46] I want that word to live through me,
[1:50:48] pulsate through my being.
[1:50:51] Forgive every one of us elders, Lord,
[1:50:53] for allowing lukewarmness and laxness.
[1:50:57] Let our homes be full of your grace.
[1:51:01] Let our church be full of your grace.
[1:51:05] [Music]
[1:51:07] In the name of Jesus, we give ourselves
[1:51:09] to you, Lord.
[1:51:14] Flow through us. Take all the stagnant
[1:51:17] waters away from us. Lord,
[1:51:21] we thank you now
