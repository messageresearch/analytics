[17:58] dearly. But have you ever really thought
[18:00] how wonderful it's going to be the day

[18:08] mind, be able to love him like you
[18:11] really want to love him. express your
[18:14] love to him like you really want to
[18:16] express. I think it's a wonderful
[18:19] thing. And um that's what we're
[18:22] preparing for, you know, preparing to
[18:24] meet the
[18:25] Lord. And so we want to say good
[18:28] evening. Good to see everyone here in
[18:31] the house of the Lord tonight. And um
[18:35] Amen. We sure uh are glad to see
[18:39] everyone.
[18:40] I'd like to look here this evening in
[18:42] the book of
[18:44] um Revelations and um we
[18:49] will we'll see here uh Revelations
[18:54] the 17th
[18:57] chapter and
[19:04] um just read a few uh verses
[19:08] here.
[19:11] Um, so we're we're glad to hear that
[19:14] Sister Angie's
[19:16] um
[19:17] that the tumor on on Sister Angie's u
[19:22] gallbladder was not cancerous. So we
[19:24] thank the Lord for that. And then I just
[19:26] I think I read that um on that biopsy
[19:28] for brother Jimmy that that wasn't
[19:30] cancerous. And so man, that's just we're
[19:33] so thankful to the Lord for that. And um
[19:37] if it was cancerous, then we just
[19:39] believe the Lord to to heal. But uh
[19:42] we're just we're just glad to hear that
[19:43] it's not cancerous at all. So this is
[19:46] this is really good good to see dad with
[19:48] us here today. And uh Amen. missed you
[19:53] on
[19:54] Sunday. So good good to have him here
[19:57] tonight. Let's look here at um uh there
[20:01] at Revelation
[20:03] 17. And uh we'll just start at the first
[20:06] verse. And there came one of the seven
[20:08] angels with which had the seven vials
[20:11] and talked with
[20:13] me, saying unto me, come hither. I will
[20:17] show unto thee the judgment of the great
[20:19] that sitth upon many
[20:22] waters, and with whom the kings of the
[20:25] earth have committed
[20:27] fornication, and inh the inhabitants of
[20:29] the earth have been made drunk with the
[20:31] wine of her fornication.
[20:33] So he carried me away in the spirit unto
[20:37] the
[20:38] wilderness. And you know, all of these
[20:40] little symbols mean a lot. The great
[20:42] We we're going to find out that
[20:44] it's a it's a a great
[20:46] city. It's the church, many waters. It's
[20:50] nations,
[20:51] multitudes, wilderness, confusion,
[20:55] bottom, uh no no foundation to her
[20:58] religion. And I saw a woman sit upon a
[21:02] scarlet colored beast full of names of
[21:05] blasphemy, having seven heads and tin
[21:09] horns. And the woman was arrayed in
[21:11] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[21:14] gold and precious stones and pearls,
[21:17] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[21:19] abominations and filthiness of her
[21:21] fornication.
[21:23] And upon her forehead was a name
[21:25] written, Mystery Babylon the Great, the
[21:28] mother of harlots, an abomination of the
[21:31] earth. I saw the woman drunken with the
[21:35] blood of the saints, and with the blood
[21:38] of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her,
[21:41] I wondered with great
[21:43] admiration. And the angel said unto me,
[21:46] "Wherefore did thou marvel?"
[21:49] And I will tell thee the mystery of the
[21:51] woman, and of the beast that carth her,
[21:55] which hath seven heads, and 10 horns.
[21:58] The beast that thou sawest was, and is
[22:01] not, shall ascend out of the bottomless
[22:04] pit, and go into predition. They that
[22:06] dwell on the earth shall worship whose
[22:08] names were not written in the book of
[22:11] life from the foundation of the world.
[22:13] When they behold the beast that was and
[22:15] is and yet is is not and yet is. Here is
[22:20] the mind which hath wisdom. The seven
[22:22] heads are seven mountains on which the
[22:25] woman sits. And there are seven kings,
[22:29] five are fallen. One is, the other is
[22:31] not yet come. And when he cometh, he
[22:36] must continue a short space. And just
[22:39] just that little portion right there, if
[22:40] you if you think about Rome, uh the five
[22:43] five kings had fallen. Neero was there
[22:47] uh when when he was um g given the
[22:50] prophecy. And then the one that came
[22:52] right after Nero, uh he he only he was
[22:56] only emperor for like uh nine months.
[22:59] Isn't Isn't that just amazing? And then
[23:02] it but then it goes on to the it says
[23:04] and the beast that was is not even he is
[23:08] the eighth and is of the seven and goeth
[23:11] into predition. And the 10 horns which
[23:14] thou sawest are 10 kings which have
[23:17] received no kingdom as yet but receive
[23:20] power as kings one hour with the beast.
[23:24] These have one mind and shall give their
[23:26] power and strength unto the beast. And
[23:29] these shall make war with the Lamb, and
[23:31] the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is
[23:33] the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and
[23:36] they that are with him are called chosen
[23:38] and faithful. Can I hear an amen? Amen.
[23:41] And he said unto me, the waters which
[23:43] thou sawest, where the sits, are
[23:47] people, multitudes, nations, and
[23:48] tongues. and the t horns that thou
[23:51] sawest upon the beast. These shall hate
[23:54] the and shall make her desolate
[23:58] and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and
[24:00] burn her with fire. For God hath put in
[24:03] their hearts to fulfill his will, to
[24:05] agree to give their kingdom unto the
[24:07] beast, until the words of God be
[24:10] fulfilled. And the woman which thou
[24:12] sawest, is that great city, which
[24:14] reignth over the kings of the earth.
[24:17] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[24:19] we want to thank you for all of your
[24:22] goodness. How good you are to us, Lord.
[24:26] We thank you for always loving us and
[24:29] always causing your grace, Lord, to
[24:34] Lord, to uh be extended to your bride.
[24:38] And Father, we never want to do
[24:40] anything, Lord, that would hurt you. We
[24:43] ask Lord that you would take away all of
[24:45] our sins and our wrongs and forgive us
[24:48] of that and that you would Lord wash us
[24:51] with your blood and prepare us for your
[24:54] soon return. Now, Father, we thank you
[24:57] for keeping your hands upon Sister Angie
[25:00] and Brother Jimmy, Lord, and thankful to
[25:02] hear that there's no cancer. And we're
[25:05] just believing that you're going to
[25:07] touch and and that you're going to move
[25:10] in every other situation in both of
[25:13] their lives. Lord, we thank you for it.
[25:16] Now, help us tonight is our prayer in
[25:18] Jesus name. Can the church say amen? And
[25:22] amen. God bless you here
[25:24] tonight.
[25:27] Amen.
[25:29] So, we
[25:31] um are are going to uh be reading some
[25:35] from the church age book, a few places
[25:38] in the church age book. Um and um the um
[25:44] but we're going to minister here this
[25:46] evening uh for a few moments on the God
[25:49] of
[25:50] force. And um we we can see clearly that
[25:56] um we are we are in the closing minutes
[25:59] of history. We are really close to the
[26:03] coming of the Lord. And um and and we
[26:07] understand amen that the words for these
[26:10] for today right before the coming of the
[26:13] Lord there was two words that were going
[26:15] to be used a lot before the Lord come
[26:19] right right at the coming of the Lord.
[26:22] Peace and safety. Amen. That's the
[26:26] apostle Paul said there in in um 1
[26:29] Thessalonians the 5th chapter and the
[26:32] first verse he says of the times and
[26:34] seasons I have no need to write unto you
[26:37] for you you have uh the second verse now
[26:41] um amen for yourselves know perfectly
[26:44] that the day of the Lord cometh as a
[26:46] thief in the night. And let's go to the
[26:48] we'll read a couple more. And when they
[26:50] shall say, "Peace and safety, sudden
[26:55] destruction shall come as travail upon a
[26:58] woman with child." So when we when we
[27:01] start hearing when we hear peace and
[27:04] safety and and of course we understand
[27:09] that President Trump is working to to he
[27:12] campaigned on law and order, man. And um
[27:17] he um you know uh President Trump is cut
[27:22] from a different mold and and I I
[27:26] believe that he is that God has put him
[27:29] here for this portion of time. He has
[27:32] anointed him uh for for this portion of
[27:36] history. He President Trump is tireless,
[27:40] relentless. Amen. He's focused and
[27:43] determined and um he's probably one of
[27:47] the most different president of any
[27:48] other president around. And the odds
[27:51] have been against President Trump from
[27:54] um from from the start as far as uh him
[27:58] coming in and and um uh as president the
[28:02] first time and then coming back. you
[28:03] know, he's known as the the comeback kid
[28:05] of presidents in politics and u but he
[28:09] he perseveres and always comes on top. I
[28:13] I personally feel like this is that he
[28:17] very much plays a part of history. I'm
[28:20] not one that that pretends to be a po a
[28:22] prophet and know knows exactly how
[28:25] things are going to go, but I I I can
[28:29] see Amen. Um I can see Revelations 13
[28:35] really coming into play here. And and
[28:38] brother Brandham, I'm we're fixing to
[28:40] read here in in the church age book. um
[28:44] what brother Brandham thinks will uh or
[28:47] as he is sharing you know the prophetic
[28:51] view but uh President Trump is is very
[28:54] eager to show the world that that the
[28:58] the US is is is is back and we're back
[29:02] greater than ever before. We've got
[29:05] strength. We're a superpower. Amen. And
[29:08] we're going to let the world know that
[29:10] listen, you can't put one on us anymore.
[29:13] We are a superpower and all we have to
[29:15] do Amen. Even in the tariffs, we're
[29:18] going to raise these tariffs and we're
[29:19] going to we're going to show that you're
[29:20] going to come bowing to us. You you're
[29:23] going to you're you we are still the
[29:27] superpower. And um if you all if your
[29:31] countries want to uh uh succeed, then
[29:35] you're going to have to do what we're
[29:36] asking you to do. Amen. we want you're
[29:40] going to start paying your fair share.
[29:42] And um and so we we can we can see how
[29:47] that the beast of Revelations 13, Amen.
[29:52] And the the he gave the power that beast
[29:56] of Revelations 13 USA gave the power to
[30:02] the to to Rome. And so we can we can see
[30:07] how this is how this is beginning to
[30:09] play out. And remember, Amen. There his
[30:13] uh the philosophy today is peace and
[30:16] safety comes through strength uh here at
[30:19] home and abroad. We're securing our
[30:21] borders. We're we're taking out the
[30:23] violent criminals. We're amen uh uh
[30:27] trying to win peace in with the and make
[30:29] friends uh win friends and make peace in
[30:32] the middle Middle East and foster peace
[30:34] between the Arab nations and Israel. I
[30:36] mean all of this stuff is is going on at
[30:40] the same time and even trying to broker
[30:43] a deal uh between Russia and and Ukraine
[30:46] and bring peace in the region. And so we
[30:49] we understand that the United States
[30:52] will seal the deal. Now, that's
[30:54] prophecy. And I and I think it's I think
[30:57] it's important for us to really
[30:59] understand where we're at. Amen. Who has
[31:02] the sway in the world? It's the United
[31:04] States. Amen. Who puts up the most funds
[31:07] in the United Nations? The
[31:10] USA. Who is the largest shareholder in
[31:14] the World Bank?
[31:16] The USA. Amen. And the USA has
[31:20] significant influence in that world
[31:23] bank. Who is the largest contributor to
[31:27] the international monetary funds? The
[31:30] United States. Amen. So, and the United
[31:34] States has the has the largest voting
[31:37] block uh in that organization, the
[31:40] International Monetary Funds. So we can
[31:43] see how that the mark of the beast is is
[31:47] is setting up and we have got us a
[31:51] president that that is ready. Amen. To
[31:56] to help usher in the peace for for the
[31:59] world. And so to me, this is something
[32:03] for you, you and and and and me to just
[32:07] raise, lift up our head and start
[32:10] rejoicing because I don't think we've
[32:13] ever been this close in history to the
[32:16] coming of the Lord Jesus. Amen. And so
[32:20] we can see, and then on the spiritual
[32:23] side, who who singlehandedly
[32:25] missionaries the world? It's the United
[32:27] States. So whatever whatever uh we come
[32:31] up with around here is going to go and
[32:34] and be broadcast uh around the the
[32:38] country. Now I think it's also something
[32:41] and you know again uh I I I' I've just
[32:44] been thinking along these lines and I
[32:46] thought you know I'm just going to come
[32:48] and just sort of share my thoughts since
[32:49] it's a Wednesday night and I won't keep
[32:51] you too long but I think these are
[32:53] interesting. um the the zealousness of
[32:57] President Trump. Amen. To fight for the
[33:00] Christians and um Amen. He he's he has
[33:04] been quoted. He has he has said we must
[33:07] bring religion back to the United
[33:11] States. We've got to bring it back. And
[33:14] so he has established he has established
[33:16] the religious liberty commission. He has
[33:19] established the uh white house uh faith
[33:22] office. He has established the task
[33:25] force to eradicate anti-Christian bias.
[33:28] And so we can we can see how that Amen.
[33:33] when you look at these things here, if
[33:36] you remember
[33:37] Constantine, you remember that
[33:39] Constantine
[33:41] uh came to he was actually a pro-ch
[33:45] Christian. He was actually a
[33:48] pro-Christian emperor that the
[33:50] Christians were being slaughtered by the
[33:53] pagans. It wasn't the Christians
[33:55] slaughtering or the Catholic Church
[33:57] slaughtering the Christians. It was the
[33:58] pagans slaughtering the Christians. And
[34:01] so it was that emperor that stood up and
[34:04] said, "Hey, amen. Uh we need to give the
[34:08] Christians their freedom." And so then
[34:12] Constantine began to he didn't he he
[34:15] didn't see the difference between church
[34:17] and state. And so he was he was saying
[34:20] that hey the state is the greatest
[34:23] friend to the church. And so then he
[34:27] began to enact the laws and give them
[34:29] churches and give them uh things of that
[34:32] nature which actually ended up bringing
[34:35] everyone together or every everyone for
[34:38] a while. But the elect began to
[34:40] understand that the uh that that Rome
[34:42] was trying to rule the church. And so
[34:45] they pulled back out. Amen. They they
[34:48] pulled back out, the elect. And when
[34:50] they pulled back out, then the
[34:54] church, the Catholic Church begin to
[34:57] call these the elect heretics. And when
[35:01] they called them heretics and would not
[35:03] go along with Constantine and and the
[35:07] great move, Christian move that they
[35:09] had. Amen. Then they they begin to
[35:12] slaughter them. And we understand
[35:14] history. Uh 68 million Christians were
[35:18] killed from the pagan church against the
[35:22] elect of God. So you can see how it was
[35:25] it was a good thought. Amen. Constantine
[35:29] was had a had a good thought. He was
[35:32] trying to help the Christians from the
[35:35] pagans killing them. But it ended up
[35:38] amen with as of course he he wasn't a
[35:40] Christian. Well, he don't know anything
[35:43] about the Bible. He don't Amen. but he
[35:45] just thought it was good to have a good
[35:47] Christian organization, you know, and
[35:49] bring it together. And so when we see
[35:52] these things here, then it makes us it
[35:55] makes us rejoice because we see uh what
[35:59] is taking place. Brother Brandham would
[36:01] say before we get into the church age
[36:03] book, he would say, I believe one of
[36:05] these glorious days when this United
[36:07] Confederation of Churches uh or
[36:09] Confederation of Church goes together
[36:11] and the new pope is brought out of the
[36:13] United States and put over there
[36:15] according to prophecy. Then they'll form
[36:18] an image unto the beast. And I tell you,
[36:20] the true church of God will be drove
[36:23] together. Now, that I understand that
[36:25] this is going around everywhere because
[36:28] we do have Amen. This was back in 1959,
[36:32] I believe it was, or 54 when brother
[36:34] Brandham had said that. And and and now
[36:37] here we are in in
[36:40] 2025. And um man, we have got we have
[36:43] got us a pope uh that or that came out
[36:47] of the United States. And so um so we we
[36:51] look at this and and we we can see
[36:55] scriptures coming to pass. We see that
[36:58] we have got a leader in the the the
[37:03] United States that there has been
[37:06] nothing be able that has been able to
[37:08] stop him. He's very persuasive.
[37:11] I can see Rome wanting to make peace and
[37:16] and really wanting to do something. I
[37:19] can see both of these men working
[37:21] together and and trying to come up with
[37:24] a solution for the world. Doesn't that
[37:26] just make you feel really good that God
[37:30] has got something that he is doing?
[37:33] Amen. Now, now remember, Amen. when this
[37:37] when this time comes, when this union
[37:41] comes,
[37:42] um, what shall we do with this Christ?
[37:44] 63. Brother Brandham says, notice when
[37:46] the world council comes together, what
[37:50] what will we do with this Jesus called
[37:52] Christ? They certainly don't want
[37:54] nothing to do with him with it. So,
[37:57] there is only one thing to do. Exactly
[38:00] what they did then. They'll crucify it.
[38:03] Certainly, they'll shut it up. Now, I
[38:06] want us to I want us to look here
[38:09] because the church today, and you can be
[38:12] turning in your church age books to page
[38:14] 236, but but the church today, the
[38:18] people today are so naive because the
[38:20] church just looks so
[38:24] uh the Catholic church just looks so
[38:29] uh they're just like a doty grandpa.
[38:32] Amen. And just these guys just look so
[38:35] cute and so innocent and so loving. And
[38:38] when you see all of these things, they
[38:40] just look like an archaic church. But
[38:42] these guys have power and influence with
[38:46] the whole world. With the whole world.
[38:49] If you guys looked or if you guys went
[38:52] and and and and and just looked at all
[38:54] of the dignitaries that that showed up
[38:57] uh to to to the inauguration of this new
[39:00] pope, the world leaders, there was
[39:04] representatives uh uh uh Vice President
[39:07] Vance was there. Uh Rubio was there. We
[39:10] there was there was a delegation from
[39:12] the United States. We're talking about
[39:14] for a church. We're talking about this
[39:17] is this is religious. This is just but
[39:20] but he come and and Macron came from
[39:25] uh whatever country he's from. I can't
[39:27] think of it right now. Uh yeah, France.
[39:29] And then we've got we had all of these
[39:31] world leaders all coming in and paying
[39:35] their respect to the to to to this new
[39:40] pope. You Hallelujah. I guarantee you I
[39:44] I don't know of I don't even know of one
[39:46] of the Pentecostal or charismatic
[39:49] megaurches you know when one's installed
[39:51] there if anyone from around the world
[39:53] would show up for that. I am saying that
[39:57] Rome still has well they are the largest
[40:00] denomination and they still have a big
[40:04] influence upon this earth
[40:08] right and the rest of the world is just
[40:10] looking at them as a religion gone by
[40:12] archaic they're but I'm telling you amen
[40:16] they are going to come there's going to
[40:18] be the mark of the beast we're fixing to
[40:20] read it here in a minute amen where
[40:22] you're not going to be able to buy or
[40:24] sell. You're not going to be able to do
[40:27] anything unless you take the mark of
[40:29] that beast. And friends, we are here
[40:33] today. And they're going to be doing it.
[40:36] Amen. Under the opus of safety and
[40:41] peace. They want peace and safety.
[40:45] They're wanting to bring they're wanting
[40:47] to make the world religious. Religious
[40:50] people are typically good. Amen. They
[40:54] don't go around killing. They don't go
[40:56] around stealing. Religious people are
[40:59] good people. I don't care what you are.
[41:01] Amen. Whether whether you're unless
[41:04] you're a Muslim, but uh you know whether
[41:06] you're a Buddhist or whether you're
[41:08] whatever you are, but even the Muslims,
[41:11] the good Muslims want to do what's good
[41:15] according to, you know, what they what
[41:17] they have learned. So the the the the
[41:20] deal is they're wanting to bring
[41:23] everybody under that religion. Let's
[41:26] make the world good. Amen. And and and
[41:29] and you okay, you can believe yours. You
[41:32] can believe what you want to believe.
[41:34] You can believe we can all believe and
[41:36] come under. Amen. And we'll just Hey,
[41:39] who's got who who's got the most uh uh
[41:42] credibility to them here? here. The
[41:45] Catholic Church has been around all of
[41:47] this time. Amen. And and we're going to
[41:50] build an image unto this Catholic Church
[41:53] and say that you're got you've got to
[41:55] belong to this world council of churches
[41:58] or you won't be able to buy, sell,
[42:02] import, export. And so here, listen
[42:05] friends, I I can I if if we are truly
[42:10] this close, brother. Oh, how we should
[42:14] love the Lord with all of our heart. We
[42:16] have got the president that just went
[42:18] over uh uh among those Middle Eastern
[42:21] countries and making deals like they've
[42:23] been making. I say, "Oh, God." Amen.
[42:26] Let's let us let us go. Can you say
[42:28] amen? Let let's look here at at at uh
[42:31] page
[42:34] 236 and um and we'll read a couple of uh
[42:38] pages
[42:39] here. Now, he just read, if you were to
[42:43] he just read there in Revelations the
[42:45] entire 13th chapter. We're not going to
[42:48] read that entire 13th chapter uh because
[42:51] he's going to deal with it
[42:53] as on these next couple pages. So we're
[42:57] So he just got through reading the
[42:59] entire 13th chapter. Again, re the
[43:01] United States, 13 colonies, 13 stripes,
[43:04] 13 and here, Revelations 13, the United
[43:07] States is involved. There's there's two
[43:10] beasts that came up. One was Rome, one
[43:13] was the USA. Amen. He said, now this
[43:16] chapter shows the power of the Roman
[43:19] Catholic Church and what she will do
[43:22] through organization. Remember this is
[43:25] the false d vine. Let it name the name
[43:28] of the Lord, but it does only in a
[43:31] lie. Its headship is not of the Lord,
[43:35] but of Satan. It finally ends up
[43:38] identified with the beast. The horror
[43:41] writing on the scarlet beast distinctly
[43:44] shows her power is the god of force,
[43:48] Satan, and not our god, the Lord Jesus
[43:52] Christ. So when you look there at that
[43:54] Rome church, when you look there at
[43:56] those that nice that nice old man that
[43:58] they call Pope, I want you to remember
[44:02] Satan is fixing to incarnate a man on
[44:06] this earth. It ain't going to be it
[44:08] ain't going to be Donald Trump. Donald
[44:10] Trump is not the antichrist, but Donald
[44:12] Trump could very well that that that
[44:15] that power of force is going to be it's
[44:19] an anointing. It's going to be on the
[44:21] earth at that time. The USA is going to
[44:26] convince the world to join with that wi
[44:29] with the Hallelujah. Amen. And it
[44:34] will be a god of force. Now in verse 17,
[44:38] it it emphatically shows that she will
[44:40] gain absolute control of the commerce of
[44:44] the earth. For no man can buy or sell
[44:47] apart from her. Isn't that a I I'm just
[44:49] I'm just saying here the USA is making
[44:52] all kinds of deals right now. Amen. They
[44:56] for no man can buy or sell apart from
[44:58] her. This is borne out in Revelations 18
[45:02] 9 through uh 9-17 which shows her
[45:06] involvement with kings, princes,
[45:08] merchants, all of whom have to do with
[45:10] Rome and commerce. Amen. And again, we
[45:13] just seen a bunch of that didn't just in
[45:17] this last month. Revelations 13:14, we
[45:21] learned that the beast spreads his
[45:23] influence through the image that was
[45:26] built for him. Who's building the image?
[45:29] It's the USA. Amen. That's that other
[45:31] beast. The image that is made is a
[45:35] worldwide ecumenical council wherein all
[45:39] the organized churches will get together
[45:41] with Roman Catholics. They're doing it
[45:44] even now. It is quite possible this
[45:46] union will come in order to stop the
[45:49] power of communism. But since communism
[45:51] like
[45:52] Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to
[45:54] burn the flesh of the harlot, the Rome
[45:57] will be overcome and destroyed. Take
[45:59] note that everywhere the Roman church
[46:01] went, communism followed. It has to be
[46:04] that way. And let me warn you now, don't
[46:07] get thinking communism is your only
[46:10] enemy. No sir, it is the Catholic Church
[46:13] also and even more so. Now, let us read
[46:17] Revelations
[46:19] 1-4 and compare this with uh Revelations
[46:24] 12 1-5. Revelations 13 1-4 I saw upon
[46:29] the sand of the sea uh I stood upon the
[46:33] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[46:34] out of the sea having seven heads and 10
[46:38] horns upon his horns 10 crowns upon his
[46:41] uh upon his heads the name of
[46:44] blasphemy. The beast which I saw was
[46:46] like unto a leopard and he had feet as
[46:49] the feet of a bear. mouth as the mouth
[46:52] of a lion, and the dragon gave him his
[46:55] power, his seat, and great authority. I
[46:58] saw one of his heads as it were wounded
[47:00] to death, and his deadly wound was
[47:03] healed, and all the world wandered after
[47:05] the beast. And they worshiped the
[47:08] dragon, which gave power unto the beast.
[47:11] And they worshiped the beast, saying,
[47:13] Who is like unto the beast? Who is able
[47:17] to make war with him? Now, this this is
[47:20] this is the beast. We're not going to go
[47:21] through the symbols. We've we've already
[47:22] gone through that many times. But now,
[47:25] Brother Brandham is going to show. Okay.
[47:27] Now, watch the beast. The symbols there
[47:29] with the beast. And now he's want us to
[47:31] look at Revelations 12:1. And he'll see
[47:35] that it's the same characteristics of
[47:37] the dragon, the devil. And there
[47:39] appeared a great wonder in heaven, a
[47:42] woman clothed with a sun, and the moon
[47:44] under her feet, and upon her head a
[47:48] crown of 12 stars. And she, being with
[47:51] child, cried, travailing in birth, and
[47:54] pain together. And there appeared
[47:57] another wonder in heaven. Behold, a
[48:00] great red dragon, having seven heads, 10
[48:03] horns, seven crowns upon his head. that
[48:06] and that that same spirit that's the
[48:09] spirit that is anointing Rome now and is
[48:12] tell the third part of the stars of
[48:14] heaven and did cast them to the earth.
[48:16] The dragon stood before the woman which
[48:19] was ready to be delivered for to deliver
[48:21] her child as soon as it was born. And
[48:24] she brought forth a manchild who was to
[48:27] rule all nations with a rod of iron. Her
[48:30] child was caught up into the Lord or or
[48:32] unto God and to his throne. Satan and
[48:36] his satanic religion are in both of
[48:39] these beasts. In Revelations 14, the
[48:43] beast was wounded unto death, but lived
[48:45] again. Is the imperial Rome, a pagan
[48:48] Rome, that fell to the onslaught of the
[48:50] barbarians and thereby lost her temporal
[48:54] power. But she regained it at in papal
[48:58] Rome. Do you see it? The nation that
[49:00] ruled by crushing all which became the
[49:04] strongest empire ever known was finally
[49:07] wounded to death. Her power was gone
[49:10] physically as to control by armies etc.
[49:13] But under Constantine she came back to
[49:16] life for papal Rome has infiltrated the
[49:20] whole earth world. Her power is
[49:23] absolute. She uses kings and merchants
[49:26] and in her deadly religious and
[49:29] financial strength. She is governing as
[49:32] the goddess at this of this present age.
[49:36] She is also the dragon that stood
[49:40] waiting to devour the manchild. Herod
[49:43] tried to kill the Lord Jesus and failed.
[49:46] Later Jesus was crucified by Roman
[49:48] soldiers but now was caught up to the
[49:50] throne. Now along with what I have just
[49:53] said, recall the vision of Daniel. The
[49:55] last part of the image, the last world
[49:58] power was in the feet. It was iron and
[50:01] clay. And see the iron is mixed or see
[50:05] the iron is the Roman
[50:08] Empire. But now it is no longer solid
[50:10] iron. Clay is mixed in it. Yet it is it
[50:14] is there and running world affairs in
[50:17] both democratic the democratic nation
[50:20] and the more despotic ones. The Roman
[50:22] church is in every nation. It is mixed
[50:25] up in it all. Let me give you a little
[50:27] something on the iron and clay. Remember
[50:29] when Kruef beat his shoe on the desk at
[50:32] the UN? Well, there were five Eastern
[50:34] nations there and five Western. Cruchef
[50:38] spoke for the east, President Eisenhower
[50:41] for the West. In Russia, Cruchef is
[50:44] clay, Eisenhower is iron. The two main
[50:48] leaders of the world, the two big toes
[50:51] of the feet of iron and clay were side
[50:54] by side were in the end of it all. So,
[50:58] we're not looking for something to start
[51:01] that all that was that was a sign that
[51:04] showed it way back then what age we were
[51:07] living in. You understand that? It took
[51:09] a prophet to say, "Okay, that has
[51:12] already taken place." Now, don't get
[51:14] laxed. Don't get laxed. Get ready. Amen.
[51:18] And understand where you're at. So, I'm
[51:20] glad for a prophet. It says in in verse
[51:23] four, it asks, "Who is able to make war
[51:25] with the beast?" Now, there are at
[51:29] present some great names in the world.
[51:31] There are some mighty nations. But right
[51:33] now, Rome is calling the shots, calling
[51:37] the tune. The pope is in the driver's
[51:39] seat. His power is going to increase. No
[51:41] one can war against
[51:43] him. Verse six, he opens his mouth in
[51:47] blasphemy, teaching for the doctrine the
[51:50] commandments of men, heady, high-minded,
[51:52] levers of pleasure, having a form of
[51:54] godliness, denying the power thereof. He
[51:57] blasphemed the name of the Lord,
[51:59] changing the name to titles, and
[52:01] refusing to do otherwise. Verse seven.
[52:04] And it was given to him to make war with
[52:06] the saints.
[52:08] Persecution, death to the true believer,
[52:11] all in the name of the Lord Jesus or in
[52:13] the name of the Lord in order uh that
[52:15] the name of God be blasphemed even as as
[52:18] it is in Russia because of of the
[52:20] Catholic religion what the Catholic
[52:22] religion did there. Verse eight, all
[52:24] that dwell upon the earth whose names
[52:27] are not written in the book of
[52:30] life uh of the lamb slain from the
[52:32] foundation of the world shall worship
[52:34] him. Thank God the sheep will not
[52:38] worship him. Everyone but the very elect
[52:41] will be deceived. They will but they
[52:44] will not be deceived for they hear the
[52:46] shepherd's voice and they follow him.
[52:49] Now then we see this what we have been
[52:52] what we have been trying to show you.
[52:55] The seed of death that started in the
[52:57] first age, the seed of organization has
[52:59] finally grown into the tree in which
[53:01] every foul bird is lodged. In spite of
[53:04] her claim that she is giver of life, she
[53:06] is the giver of death. Her fruit is
[53:08] death. That they that partake of her are
[53:11] dead. the mighty world church system
[53:13] that fools uh the world that in her
[53:17] physical and spiritual salvation
[53:19] deceives and destroys the multitudes.
[53:22] Now only but not only is she uh death
[53:27] personified but this is the death
[53:29] carrying creature but this death
[53:32] carrying creature will be itself put to
[53:34] death and uh with the death of which is
[53:38] in the lake of fire. Oh, that men would
[53:41] perceive what their end will be by
[53:43] remaining in her. Come out of her for
[53:47] for why will ye die? Can you say amen?
[53:51] And so we so we can see here that it is
[53:56] a god of force. Amen. It's it's it's a
[53:59] God of force. Now, there's a lot of
[54:00] folks that are that are talking about
[54:02] Russia and China right now. And it's and
[54:05] it's incredible how Russia and China are
[54:07] are are are coming together and um um
[54:13] there's a lot of but but brother
[54:14] Brandham Brother Brandham would say amen
[54:18] uh in conference he says listen thus
[54:21] saith the Lord repent I predict three
[54:25] curtains in the name of the Lord there's
[54:28] one called the iron curtain which will
[54:29] be Russia watch red China that'll be the
[54:34] bamboo curtain.
[54:35] They're horrible. But watch that purple
[54:38] curtain that's rising in the United
[54:40] States and over the world, the Roman
[54:41] Empire, the crulest of them all.
[54:44] Remember, in the name of the Lord, get
[54:47] away from it. Come away from anything
[54:50] that is attached to it. Flee to the
[54:53] rock, for the coming of the Lord is at
[54:57] hand. He would also say, Amen. And he
[55:00] says the confederation of churches which
[55:02] will form the image of the beast. We all
[55:05] know that. He says and there it is all
[55:07] working right around to bring all the
[55:09] churches together, unite ourselves
[55:11] together to fight communism. Don't you
[55:14] worry about communism. It ain't going to
[55:17] be the thing to fight. There's the three
[55:20] curtains. I say this in the name of the
[55:22] Lord. Don't you forget there is the iron
[55:25] curtain, Russia. Bamboo curtain, China.
[55:30] A purple curtain, Rome. Watch the purple
[55:34] curtain. Keep your eye on that. He says,
[55:39] uh, he says, he says, "What's the matter
[55:42] with the preachers today? Communism.
[55:46] Every preacher is out here trying to
[55:48] fight communism." Communism, nothing.
[55:51] The thing, the devil is weaving it right
[55:54] under your nose and you don't know it.
[55:57] It's Romanism,
[56:00] denominationalism. Rome is the mother of
[56:03] denominations. The Bible said she was a
[56:05] and her daughters are harlots
[56:08] against God and his word. So, we can see
[56:13] that these things are here. Now, now
[56:16] it's it's important to note that these
[56:19] that these communist nations have got to
[56:22] come. They they have got to come because
[56:24] they're going to play a big role. um in
[56:27] in the in in the
[56:30] uh in taking out the Amen. These
[56:34] these nations, these these um these
[56:37] kings are going to uh they're going to
[56:40] burn Rome. Amen. Now, now, Brother
[56:45] Brandham would tell us that we're not
[56:47] just to ignore Russia because Russia is
[56:51] is uh will will play that big part. He
[56:54] says, remember the third vision? He said
[56:55] the third vision in the seven visions.
[56:58] He says the third vision was in the
[57:00] realm of of the world of politics. For
[57:03] it showed me that there would be three
[57:05] isms. Nazi uh uh fascism, Nazism and
[57:10] communism, but that the first two would
[57:13] be swallowed up into the third. The the
[57:16] voice said, "Mishe, watch Russia. Watch
[57:19] Russia. Keep your eyes on the king of
[57:22] the north." Amen. So, so why are are we
[57:26] to watch Russia? Because Russia is going
[57:30] to be the one that destroys the
[57:32] Vatican where where they are now. I now
[57:35] again here we are. We've got these
[57:37] communistic countries all coming
[57:39] together. Amen. They're they're they're
[57:41] they're come they're even Russia and
[57:43] China is is even is is even uh making
[57:47] deals with the other uh Arab nations.
[57:50] So, we've got the US make, you know, he
[57:52] they Trump went through three of them
[57:55] and uh but Russia is also making deals
[57:58] too with with these other countries. So,
[58:02] here we are. We're we're we're at
[58:05] play. We're back at the world. Russia
[58:08] has just now risen back up in the
[58:11] forefront again.
[58:13] and and we when we look at where we are,
[58:17] we can we can see the the prophecy all
[58:22] coming together and we've even got a
[58:25] pope here in the United States.
[58:28] So, we can see these pieces here and and
[58:32] and if you if you remember Russia is
[58:36] going to drop a bomb on the Vatican
[58:39] city.
[58:41] Amen. going to drop a bomb and she will
[58:43] and and and according to scripture
[58:45] Revelations 18 and8 he says there shall
[58:49] her plagues come in one day death and
[58:53] mourning and famine and she shall be
[58:56] utterly burned with fire for strong is
[58:59] the Lord God who judgeth her 10th verse
[59:03] standing afar for the fear of her
[59:05] torment saying the these are these are
[59:07] all the guys that have that have uh uh
[59:10] uhh uh you know, the kings and the
[59:13] princes and and and and all of the
[59:16] merchants, they're they're all seeing
[59:18] this and they're standing afar. And I
[59:20] don't want to read the whole thing, but
[59:21] you can you you can read it when you get
[59:22] home. But Revelations 18:10, standing
[59:25] afar for the fear of her torment,
[59:27] saying, "Alas, alas, the great city
[59:31] Babylon, the mighty city, for in one
[59:34] hour is thy judgment come." If you go
[59:37] down to Revelations 18:17, for in one
[59:41] hour so great riches is come to not
[59:45] every shipmaster and all the companies
[59:47] and ships and sailors and as many as
[59:49] trade stood a far off. So, so here here
[59:54] we go. Brother Brandon would say,
[59:56] remember I say this is God's prophet.
[1:00:00] The Russian Empire will drop an atomic
[1:00:03] bomb of some sort on the Vatican City
[1:00:06] and destroy her in one hour. Thus saith
[1:00:10] the Lord.
[1:00:13] Here we are, friends.
[1:00:15] Amen. Here we are. I say that this is an
[1:00:20] incredible season that we're living in.
[1:00:25] Now, what is going to happen? These
[1:00:28] kings, these nations are all going to
[1:00:31] agree. Amen. They're going to agree with
[1:00:34] her. They're going to give the kingdoms
[1:00:36] to her for one hour. They're all going
[1:00:38] to come together. Amen. But then and and
[1:00:42] and it's going to catch her off guard.
[1:00:44] It's going to catch that. So, if the
[1:00:47] deal making is going on, could it be
[1:00:49] that we actually have some deals going
[1:00:52] on really soon? Could it be that this is
[1:00:56] remember when this stuff comes, we won't
[1:00:59] be here. The rapture is going to be
[1:01:02] taking place. Can you say amen? Amen. So
[1:01:07] when we see these things that are taking
[1:01:09] place, then we lift up our head and and
[1:01:12] we rejoice be w because God has promised
[1:01:17] that this would happen. Amen. And he and
[1:01:20] and it it is coming. God is keeping his
[1:01:23] word. Amen. All of those guys that says,
[1:01:26] "Oh, fooy on brother Brandham."
[1:01:28] Hallelujah. Saying fooy. Yeah. He was
[1:01:32] I'm telling you, he knew a little bit
[1:01:33] more. Knows a little bit more than they
[1:01:35] will ever know.
[1:01:37] And you know a little bit more than what
[1:01:39] they'll ever know. That's right. Rome.
[1:01:44] Ro Rome looked even in brother
[1:01:46] Brandham's day now. They looked they
[1:01:48] just looked so peaceful and so nice and
[1:01:50] so naive. They just look like they're so
[1:01:52] innocent. But when Brother Brandham
[1:01:54] wrote the church age book, Amen. there
[1:01:57] in page
[1:02:00] 220 and
[1:02:07] um and I'm I'm just I'm just going to
[1:02:09] read two pages here to you. Amen. He
[1:02:14] says uh 2
[1:02:16] 228 and and we'll start at the second
[1:02:19] paragraph. It was Constantine's idea to
[1:02:23] get everyone together, the pagans,
[1:02:26] nominal Christians, and true Christians.
[1:02:29] For a while, it looked like he would
[1:02:31] succeed for the real believers come
[1:02:33] along to see if they could bring back
[1:02:36] the ones that had drifted away from the
[1:02:38] word. But when they saw that they
[1:02:40] couldn't bring them back into the truth,
[1:02:43] they were forced to break away from the
[1:02:45] body political.
[1:02:48] And then when they did, they were called
[1:02:51] heretics and persecuted. Let me say
[1:02:53] right here that we have the very same
[1:02:55] thing going on right now. People are all
[1:02:57] coming together. They're writing a Bible
[1:03:00] that will suit everyone whether it be a
[1:03:02] Jew, Catholic, or
[1:03:04] Protestant. They have their own nyan
[1:03:06] council, but they call it the ecumenical
[1:03:09] council. And do you know whom all these
[1:03:12] organizations fight? They fight the true
[1:03:15] Pentecostals. I don't mean the
[1:03:17] organization called Pentecostal. I mean
[1:03:19] the ones who are Pentecostal because
[1:03:22] they are filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:23] have the signs and gifts in their midst
[1:03:26] because they walk in truth. When Ahab
[1:03:28] married Jezebel for political reasons,
[1:03:30] he sold his birthight. You join up with
[1:03:33] a with an organization and you sell your
[1:03:36] birthright, brother, whether you want to
[1:03:38] believe it or not, every Protestant
[1:03:40] group that ever came out and then went
[1:03:42] back sold their birthright. And when you
[1:03:45] sell your birthright, you're just like
[1:03:47] Esau. You can cry and repent all you
[1:03:50] want, but it won't do you any good. My
[1:03:53] my. There is only one thing you can do,
[1:03:56] and that is come out of her, my people.
[1:03:58] Stop partaking of her sins. Now, if you
[1:04:01] don't think I'm right, just answer this
[1:04:03] one question. Can any man living tell me
[1:04:07] what church or what move of God has ever
[1:04:09] had revival and come back after she went
[1:04:12] into organization and and become a
[1:04:15] denomination? Read your histories. You
[1:04:17] can't find one. Not even one. It was the
[1:04:20] midnight hour for Israel when she joined
[1:04:23] the world and left the spiritual for
[1:04:26] political. It was the midnight hour in
[1:04:28] Nya when the church did the same. It is
[1:04:31] the midnight hour now that the churches
[1:04:33] are coming together. Now when Ahab
[1:04:35] married Jezebel, he allowed her to take
[1:04:38] the state money and erect two houses of
[1:04:41] worship of of Eardarti and Baal. And the
[1:04:44] one was erected for Baal was big enough
[1:04:46] for all Israel to come and and to uh
[1:04:49] worship. When Constantine and the church
[1:04:52] married, he gave the church buildings,
[1:04:54] set up altars and images, and organized
[1:04:57] the hierarchy that had already been
[1:04:59] shaping up. When Jezebel got the power
[1:05:02] of the state behind her, she forced her
[1:05:05] religion on the people and killed the
[1:05:07] prophets and priests of God. It got so
[1:05:10] bad that Elijah, the messenger to his
[1:05:13] day, thought that he was the only one
[1:05:14] left. But God had 7,000 more that hadn't
[1:05:17] bowed the knee to Baal. And right now
[1:05:20] out there among those denominations of
[1:05:22] Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterians, etc.
[1:05:25] There are some that will come out and
[1:05:27] come back to God. I want you to know uh
[1:05:31] to know I am not now and never have been
[1:05:34] against the people. It's the
[1:05:35] organization, the system of organization
[1:05:39] that I'm against. I have to be against
[1:05:42] it for God hates it. Now, just let us
[1:05:45] stop a minute here and rehearse what we
[1:05:47] brought out about the the worship of
[1:05:50] Thyra.
[1:05:52] Uh, let's see here. Amen. I tell you
[1:05:56] what, we're going to go ahead and skip
[1:05:57] that on down. And
[1:06:01] um and um I wanted I want to look at
[1:06:04] let's let's go to 231 and
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:14] 2 and and um so 231 and the second the
[1:06:20] second paragraph it says let us now go
[1:06:22] over to Revelation 17 and see this woman
[1:06:25] the church who was living on false
[1:06:28] prophecies and not the word of God. In
[1:06:30] verse one, God calls her the great
[1:06:32] Why is she a Because she's
[1:06:35] in idolatry. She's in idolatry. She has
[1:06:38] caught the people up into the same
[1:06:40] thing. What's the cure for idolatry? The
[1:06:42] word of God. So this woman is a
[1:06:46] because she has left the word. There she
[1:06:49] is sitting upon many waters, which means
[1:06:51] multitudes of people. This surely has to
[1:06:54] be the false church because the church
[1:06:56] of God is small. Few there be that find
[1:06:59] it. Notice what she is like in the eyes
[1:07:03] of God. No matter how wonderful she
[1:07:05] looks to people, how philosophical she
[1:07:07] sounds, she is filthy drunk on her
[1:07:12] fornications. Now she was drunk with the
[1:07:14] blood of martyrs. Just like Jezebel who
[1:07:17] killed the prophets and priests and
[1:07:19] destroyed the people of God who would
[1:07:20] not bow and worship Baal. And that is
[1:07:24] exactly what the church, Catholic church
[1:07:26] did. They killed those who would not bow
[1:07:28] down to the popish rule. Those who
[1:07:30] wanted the word of God instead of the
[1:07:33] words of men were put to death usually
[1:07:35] by cruel methods by th but this church
[1:07:38] that dealt in death was dead herself and
[1:07:41] didn't know it. There was no life in
[1:07:43] her. No signs ever followed her.
[1:07:46] Revelations
[1:07:47] 2021, I gave her a space to repent of
[1:07:50] her fornication and she repented not. Do
[1:07:53] you know that this church actually was
[1:07:55] more wicked than Jacob, than Ahab? Do
[1:07:58] you know that he repented for a while
[1:08:00] and walked softly before God? You can't
[1:08:03] say that of the Roman Catholic Church.
[1:08:05] No, sir. She has never repented, but
[1:08:08] stubbornly destroyed any and all who
[1:08:12] tried to help her repent. That is
[1:08:14] history. God is God kept raising up not
[1:08:18] only the messengers through the age, but
[1:08:20] he raised up wonderful helpers for those
[1:08:22] messengers. He gave every aid some
[1:08:24] wonderful men of God and they did
[1:08:26] everything they could to bring the
[1:08:28] church back to God. God certainly gave
[1:08:30] her opportunity and helped to repent.
[1:08:34] Did she ever repent and show that she
[1:08:37] did by her fruit? No sir, she never has
[1:08:40] and she never will. She is drunk. She
[1:08:43] has lost her senses to spiritual things.
[1:08:47] Now, don't be confused and start
[1:08:48] thinking the church of Rome has repented
[1:08:51] of her slaughter of the saints because
[1:08:53] she is attempting to unite the
[1:08:55] Protestants by making her creeds line up
[1:08:57] with the Protestant creeds. Not once has
[1:09:01] she ever apologized and said she was
[1:09:04] wrong for her mass murders. She won't
[1:09:07] either. And no matter how mellow and
[1:09:10] sweet she appears at this particular
[1:09:13] time, she will yet rise to kill. For
[1:09:16] murder lies in her evil and unrepentant
[1:09:21] heart. Hallelujah.
[1:09:25] So when we when when we see here, I just
[1:09:29] wanted to come I just wanted to show
[1:09:32] just a just a few things that I have
[1:09:34] seen as in in the scripture and um uh
[1:09:39] some things that I thought was I I I
[1:09:42] thought was was interesting and and if
[1:09:46] if you remember remember uh sister Kala
[1:09:49] u Revelations 13 and um I believe it
[1:09:54] would be nine where it starts talking
[1:09:56] about the uh about USA. Let's just read
[1:10:00] that as we get ready to
[1:10:02] close. But this is
[1:10:06] um uh okay. So the uh the 10th
[1:10:15] verse 11th verse and I beheld another
[1:10:19] beast coming up out of the
[1:10:22] earth and he had two horns like a lamb
[1:10:26] and he spake as a dragon. Now like a
[1:10:29] lamb he was not a lamb. the American
[1:10:32] buffalo. Amen. Also had the civil and
[1:10:36] the ecclesiastical
[1:10:37] horns. It came out of nothingness where
[1:10:41] there was no previous uh uh uh world
[1:10:45] power and he exercised all the power of
[1:10:49] the first beast before him. Now what is
[1:10:52] that first beast? That is Rome who was
[1:10:54] anointed by the dragon. And now he he
[1:10:58] exercises all the power that was before
[1:11:00] him. And and he causes who's who's going
[1:11:04] to do the causing? The USA. And causes
[1:11:08] the earth and them which dwell therein
[1:11:11] to worship the first beast whose deadly
[1:11:14] wound was
[1:11:16] healed. And he doeth great wonders, so
[1:11:19] that he maketh fire come down from
[1:11:21] heaven on the earth in the sight of men.
[1:11:24] Now, brother Brandon would say, "Now,
[1:11:26] this is the superpower, the atomic bomb.
[1:11:29] This is this is he has he he is supreme
[1:11:33] in the world system uh with his with his
[1:11:37] firepower, his
[1:11:38] military." All
[1:11:41] right? And deceiveth them that dwell on
[1:11:45] the earth by the means of those miracles
[1:11:47] which he had the power to do in the
[1:11:49] sight of the beast. sang to them that
[1:11:52] dwell on the earth, that they should
[1:11:53] make an image to the beast, which had
[1:11:57] the wound by a sword, and did live. He
[1:12:01] had the power to give life unto the
[1:12:03] image of the beast, and that the image
[1:12:06] of the beast should both speak. Now,
[1:12:08] who's got the power? Who's doing the
[1:12:10] causing? Who's got the power to give
[1:12:12] life? Who's the USA?
[1:12:16] And the image of the beast should both
[1:12:17] speak, and cause that as many as would
[1:12:20] not worship the beast should be the
[1:12:22] image of the beast should be killed. And
[1:12:25] he causeth all both small and great,
[1:12:28] rich and poor, free and bond, to receive
[1:12:31] a mark in their hand and in their
[1:12:33] foreheads, that no man might buy or
[1:12:36] sell, save he that had the mark or the
[1:12:39] name of the beast, or the number of his
[1:12:41] name. Here is wisdom. He that hath
[1:12:44] understanding, count the number of the
[1:12:45] beast, for it is the number of a man,
[1:12:48] and his number is 600, three score, and
[1:12:51] six.
[1:12:53] So, do you see how that we've got we
[1:12:56] we've got a guy that's that's that's
[1:12:58] we've got a guy in the USA right now
[1:13:00] that's got a that's just wielding his
[1:13:03] sword pretty heavy.
[1:13:06] all all under the name, amen, of of
[1:13:10] of the golden age. And and uh Amen.
[1:13:15] They're trying to pass the big beautiful
[1:13:17] bill. And you know, we're we're going to
[1:13:19] have Oh, we're going to I tell you,
[1:13:22] could this be the time? Could this
[1:13:24] actually be the time that we're going
[1:13:27] home? Is this really the time? You say,
[1:13:30] "Brother Wendle, oh, people have thought
[1:13:32] it was before." But there will come a
[1:13:35] time. There was a time when Noah quit
[1:13:38] preaching it's going to rain. There was
[1:13:41] a time and he preached it and he
[1:13:43] preached it and he preached it. Friends,
[1:13:46] the coming of the Lord is upon
[1:13:49] us. He's going to come. There will be a
[1:13:53] rapture. There will be an elect who is
[1:13:56] ready to
[1:13:57] go. Let's make sure.
[1:14:01] Oh, let's make sure. Let's not not out
[1:14:05] of
[1:14:06] fear. I mean, there needs to be a godly
[1:14:09] fear. There there needs we there's
[1:14:11] there's no fear for for for authority of
[1:14:14] any kind anymore. And there should be
[1:14:17] fear for
[1:14:19] authority. Amen. And and the reason
[1:14:21] there's no a fear for authority out here
[1:14:24] is because there's no fear or authority
[1:14:26] here. the the the the the
[1:14:29] the source of all authority is God's
[1:14:32] word. And when you when you throw when
[1:14:34] the word doesn't mean anything to you
[1:14:36] and
[1:14:37] it's then then other things all come
[1:14:41] into that thing as well. And so we want
[1:14:44] the word to be our
[1:14:46] absolute. We won't we don't want to
[1:14:49] become one of those lawless
[1:14:51] layans that that is is just amen uh uh
[1:14:58] doing our own thing but we've got a
[1:15:00] headship under Jesus Christ and that
[1:15:02] word must be our everything.
[1:15:05] Can you say amen? Amen. Isn't God so
[1:15:09] wonderful?
[1:15:11] Oh, he's so lovely. So what uh so is
[1:15:15] there is there anything that anyone
[1:15:17] wants to add or a question to ask here
[1:15:19] tonight? Amen. I I just wanted to come
[1:15:23] and and and bring in some of those
[1:15:25] things here that we have read in the
[1:15:27] past and and um
[1:15:30] u I don't know. I don't know. Someone
[1:15:33] says, "Well, you know, Francis, he and
[1:15:37] Trump ain't went very close, and neither
[1:15:39] is uh and and and neither is Leo." Amen.
[1:15:45] And uh um did you know, did you know
[1:15:48] what Leo you know the meaning of Leo?
[1:15:51] King. King
[1:15:53] Leo. King. Hallelujah. And the man of
[1:15:57] sin according to Revelations would set
[1:15:59] as God when the King of Kings come or
[1:16:03] there in 1 Thessalonians.
[1:16:06] Amen. 1 Thessalonians 2. He would he
[1:16:09] would sat on the throne of God, the
[1:16:11] temple of God, worshiped his God. And um
[1:16:16] I don't know. I I I tell you what, it's
[1:16:20] an exciting time. It's an exciting time.
[1:16:24] It'd be an exciting time. No more gray
[1:16:26] hairs. You you that have lost your hair
[1:16:28] like me and getting gray. Amen. Those
[1:16:32] that are that are constant that have
[1:16:34] been fighting with all that's in your
[1:16:36] bodies and all of these things that are
[1:16:38] going on, there's coming a time. No more
[1:16:41] heartaches. No more, oh, let's be ready.
[1:16:45] Satan is trying his best to make sure
[1:16:48] you don't make it. He's a deceiver. He's
[1:16:52] got this whole leota as laxness. It's
[1:16:56] lukewarmness. It's it's it's neither
[1:16:59] light nor nor darkness. It's the
[1:17:01] twilight. And we live in this age and it
[1:17:04] becomes so twilight and we can say that
[1:17:07] we believe these things. But if our
[1:17:09] heart is saying something else, then we
[1:17:11] fulfill the exact that when Jesus came,
[1:17:14] you say it with your lips, but your
[1:17:17] heart is far from me. Oh God, I've been
[1:17:21] I've been asking the Lord. Oh God, renew
[1:17:24] my love for you. Amen. As I've been
[1:17:26] talking a little bit on loving the Lord.
[1:17:28] Oh, let that love come back. Oh, you
[1:17:32] say, "Brother Wendle, it's hard." Amen.
[1:17:35] Well, if it'll give you any any kind of
[1:17:39] any any kind of understanding. And this
[1:17:41] was very prophetic when brother Brandham
[1:17:43] said, "The only love that will even be
[1:17:47] found on the earth will be found in
[1:17:50] God's elect." The only love that can be
[1:17:53] found. Can you imagine? Everyone else is
[1:17:56] doing it. The the the love that they
[1:17:59] claim to have is is for their own
[1:18:00] political gain or their own the it's
[1:18:04] it's all coming back to me somehow. But
[1:18:07] the love for God, the love for his word,
[1:18:10] the love, Amen, to drop attitudes and
[1:18:14] drop sin and drop these things around
[1:18:17] us, get out of sin and say, "I want to
[1:18:20] serve God." Listen, if I have to serve
[1:18:22] God all by myself, I'm going to serve
[1:18:24] God. If I if I have to walk, Amen.
[1:18:28] without my wife, without my children,
[1:18:30] without my uh pastor, without anybody.
[1:18:32] If if if all else backslides, I I'm
[1:18:36] going to walk with God. I want to walk
[1:18:38] with God. Isn't that your heart's
[1:18:41] desire? We must make this rapture,
[1:18:44] friends. We must make this rapture.
[1:18:47] Amen. Remember the the the the all of
[1:18:51] the virgins were sleeping. Amen. All of
[1:18:54] the virgins were sleeping. But there was
[1:18:56] a but but there was a call coming out.
[1:18:59] There was a call coming out. Get ready.
[1:19:02] Prepare. And that's when the foolish and
[1:19:06] the wise woke up. They woke up. Amen.
[1:19:11] Saying, "The bridegroom cometh. Oh God."
[1:19:15] Amen. That voice has come. And that
[1:19:17] voice was the prophet of Malachi 4. It
[1:19:20] was Revelations 10:7. That was that
[1:19:23] voice saying, "Prepare. be ready. Amen.
[1:19:27] But we don't want to go back to sleep.
[1:19:29] We're in the very last leg. And what was
[1:19:31] in that in that vision where where
[1:19:32] brother in in the masterpiece where
[1:19:34] brother Brandon was talking about how
[1:19:36] that the he saw the vision of the of the
[1:19:38] first church that came around and he
[1:19:40] says, "I want to show you the church and
[1:19:42] the church was all just beautiful." He
[1:19:44] said it wasn't wasn't really a march,
[1:19:46] but it was two onward Christian
[1:19:48] soldiers. He says, "But it was it wasn't
[1:19:50] it was a they were all in unity, unified
[1:19:52] as they're walking, but it was a
[1:19:54] graceful woman a a walk." Amen. And they
[1:19:58] were beautiful and and and and then they
[1:20:00] went they they went around the corner.
[1:20:03] And he says, "All right, now I'm going
[1:20:04] to show you the the the church of the
[1:20:07] USA." and and and and then all of these
[1:20:10] naked uh uh uh females, cut hair,
[1:20:15] makeup on and they were dancing to rock
[1:20:18] and roll music and and all of that
[1:20:21] nonsense. And and Brother Brandham got
[1:20:24] so sick he turned said, "I out of
[1:20:26] everything that I've done, I I just
[1:20:28] don't know." And and he he says, "I he
[1:20:32] was just so discouraged." Amen. And as
[1:20:35] he watched them, uh, they they went they
[1:20:39] they they went down. They just went down
[1:20:41] into abyss. And then and then the angel
[1:20:44] of the Lord told brother Brandham says,
[1:20:45] "Hang on, Amen. The church will come in
[1:20:49] preview again." And when he looked, here
[1:20:53] come from every
[1:20:55] nation, every kindred. There were there
[1:20:59] were there was women coming so graceful,
[1:21:02] their hair so beautiful. And we know
[1:21:04] that we represent the bride. Their bride
[1:21:06] represents us. And and and and and the
[1:21:09] woman does. And so here they were just
[1:21:11] beautiful long. And they they were just
[1:21:13] marching along and they was coming by
[1:21:16] and they had looked at brother Brandham
[1:21:18] as as if they they understood who he
[1:21:20] was. And and as they were coming and
[1:21:23] then brother Brandham says, but as they
[1:21:25] were as they were going, Amen. He looked
[1:21:27] there toward the end and there was there
[1:21:30] at the end he said there was some that
[1:21:32] were getting out of step. They were
[1:21:34] looking down at at the cries. They were
[1:21:36] looking down at the others and and and
[1:21:39] they and brother Brandham in the vision,
[1:21:41] brother Brandham told those people that
[1:21:43] were at the very end, that's me and you
[1:21:45] now. He's screaming out, "Get back in
[1:21:49] line.
[1:21:51] Get back in line." And the first one
[1:21:54] went around, but the second one went up
[1:21:56] into the sky in rapture. Now, that's one
[1:21:58] of brother Brandham's last visions. Oh,
[1:22:01] God, help us to make sure that we're in
[1:22:04] that. Let's not let's not let anything
[1:22:07] Are you understanding me? Let's make
[1:22:09] sure. Am I lining up? Is my heart What's
[1:22:13] my Is my heart constantly on things that
[1:22:16] you you've got to you've got to you've
[1:22:18] got to make God your priority now? Amen.
[1:22:21] Listen, you got to make your wife your
[1:22:23] priority. You got to make your husband.
[1:22:24] It's not easy in this in this fast-paced
[1:22:28] world to to to keep that flame to
[1:22:31] burning. And where you understand mama
[1:22:33] and she understands you, how much more
[1:22:37] with our Lord Jesus Christ, we got to
[1:22:39] keep that flame to going. Amen. If we're
[1:22:43] getting lukewarm tonight, I just want to
[1:22:45] tell you that God's got plenty of blood.
[1:22:47] He's got plenty of blood to wash you and
[1:22:50] cleanse you. Amen. And make us who he
[1:22:53] wants us to be. Listen, friends, we are
[1:22:56] going in a rapture. It is thus sayaeth
[1:22:59] the Lord. We don't know when it is, but
[1:23:02] according to what we're seeing and
[1:23:04] everything that Brother Brandham's laid
[1:23:05] out and the scripture and his
[1:23:07] interpretation to scripture, this scene
[1:23:10] could be fitting the picture really good
[1:23:13] right now.
[1:23:15] Amen. It don't. We We're not one that
[1:23:17] has to have all the evidences. I'm not
[1:23:19] saying that. I am saying when you're
[1:23:20] seeing scriptures being fulfilled, then
[1:23:22] we need to start lifting up our head.
[1:23:25] The bridegroom comes, the bridegroom
[1:23:27] comes. Help me, Lord Jesus. Can you say
[1:23:30] amen? If you don't have the baptism of
[1:23:32] the Holy Ghost, amen. If your nature is
[1:23:35] not one with his, oh, then you need to
[1:23:38] start seeking the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:40] Ghost. Don't don't let this just be a
[1:23:42] normal church service. Don't let don't
[1:23:45] let none of our church services from
[1:23:47] here forward be just normal church
[1:23:49] services. Oh God, let the presence of
[1:23:52] the Lord be with us, shaping us up,
[1:23:55] preparing us for his coming, moving upon
[1:23:57] us. Amen. For we know that he his his
[1:24:01] coming is very, very near. If the
[1:24:05] musicians would come.
[1:24:08] Amen. We're thankful to the Lord. Oh,
[1:24:11] isn't God good? Oh my, God is so good.
[1:24:16] Help me, Lord. Looking in the mirror of
[1:24:19] your word. And when you women got
[1:24:23] married,
[1:24:25] Amen. Y'all stood in front of the mirror
[1:24:27] a lot looking at trying on
[1:24:30] dresses. Amen. Getting your colors
[1:24:34] together. Then the day come and you was
[1:24:37] fixing your hair, getting everything all
[1:24:40] together.
[1:24:42] There was a nervous There was a nervous
[1:24:46] but
[1:24:50] incredibly joyous
[1:24:53] emotions in your
[1:24:55] heart. Nervous, wanted everything to go
[1:24:58] right. Nervous. You wanted to make sure
[1:25:00] everything went
[1:25:02] good. But at the same time, you you were
[1:25:06] fixing to be married.
[1:25:12] Friends, we should take God at his word
[1:25:15] and say,
[1:25:16] "Lord, am I looking
[1:25:19] good? Help me,
[1:25:21] Lord. I don't want no spots on my
[1:25:25] garment." What is
[1:25:28] spots? It's spots of the
[1:25:32] world. It's things that we allow in our
[1:25:34] spirits
[1:25:36] that that that aren't right.
[1:25:39] We got to
[1:25:41] worship. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:25:43] We got to got to take those things and
[1:25:45] help me, Lord.
[1:25:50] And we're all in our own states, in our
[1:25:52] own stages, whether you're a kid,
[1:25:55] obeying mom and
[1:25:57] dad, taking care of
[1:25:59] responsibilities, asking the Lord to
[1:26:01] help you overcome, whether it be lying
[1:26:05] or stealing or any of those kinds of
[1:26:08] things. Wash my heart, Lord. Fill me
[1:26:11] with your spirit. put your nature in me
[1:26:15] so that I can think like you and desire
[1:26:17] like you. Because when you have the
[1:26:20] nature of God in you, you don't you're
[1:26:23] humble. It makes you it it it makes you
[1:26:27] want to serve. It makes you want to
[1:26:30] love. That's for kids. But then there's
[1:26:34] us adults and we're not kids anymore.
[1:26:37] But the scriptures for us for us
[1:26:40] husbands, us
[1:26:42] men, there things we have to really deal
[1:26:45] with. And as we're looking in the word
[1:26:47] and we're looking at ourselves through
[1:26:49] the mirror of his word, we say, "There's
[1:26:51] areas here that I I really need to shore
[1:26:54] up on. Lord, I need a little bit more of
[1:26:58] your blood and scrub me. I want I want
[1:27:01] to be scrubbed." You women the same way.
[1:27:04] You can't take the man scriptures.
[1:27:05] You've got your own. Amen. And you take
[1:27:08] those scriptures and you say, "Lord, am
[1:27:11] I looking like your word? Am I looking
[1:27:13] like you want me to look?" You see what
[1:27:16] I'm saying? Let's take all of
[1:27:22] this. He's
[1:27:24] coming. He's
[1:27:26] coming. I love him so
[1:27:29] much. I love him so much.
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:39] before.
[1:27:44] Let me
[1:27:47] hear your tender
[1:27:50] voice
[1:27:53] say to
[1:27:55] me, "Won't you
[1:27:59] willingly
[1:28:02] open the door?
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:09] Let me
[1:28:11] fall in love with
[1:28:15] you all
[1:28:18] over
[1:28:20] again. Let me know
[1:28:24] you as
[1:28:27] never before.
[1:28:33] Let me
[1:28:36] hear your tender
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] voice
[1:28:42] say to
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:53] me. Dog gone it. He loves you so much.
[1:29:00] He loves every one of you so
[1:29:04] much. He put this in
[1:29:07] scripture, then sent us a prophet in the
[1:29:10] last days to make sure we wouldn't miss
[1:29:13] it because of his love for
[1:29:16] you. I love him. I love
[1:29:22] him.
[1:29:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:28] In an age where it seems we wake up
[1:29:31] tired, go throughout the day
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:38] tired. Sometimes we feel
[1:29:41] like I just don't know if I'm the one
[1:29:44] that Jesus is coming back for. I don't
[1:29:46] know. Just can't dedicate like I want
[1:29:49] to. But I I I just want to let you
[1:29:51] know you're his elect. You're the one
[1:29:53] that's heard the voice of the
[1:29:55] bridegroom.
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:30:01] Just love
[1:30:04] him. Just love him. You might not have
[1:30:08] chills going up and down your spine, but
[1:30:11] just love the
[1:30:13] Lord. Spend that time with him. Lord, I
[1:30:18] want your supernatural presence with me.
[1:30:21] I want it with me. I want that
[1:30:24] presence. Amen. God bless you.
[1:30:27] Now
[1:30:30] open the
[1:30:34] Lord. Oh, let me
[1:30:39] fall in love with
[1:30:42] you all
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:48] over. Let me know.
[1:30:51] Take sin from me.
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] Oh, let me
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:04] hear your tender
[1:31:07] voice
[1:31:10] say to
[1:31:14] me. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:22] I think not bulldoging our way through
[1:31:24] life, but just being a wife to the
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:31] Lord. There's a reason that God kept the
[1:31:35] things separate. He made a covenant with
[1:31:36] the woman, made a covenant with a man.
[1:31:39] That's why he said he don't want a man
[1:31:41] wearing that which pertains to a woman.
[1:31:43] He don't want a woman wearing that which
[1:31:45] pertains to a man. It's an abomination
[1:31:47] to him. Why? Why would he do
[1:31:51] that? Because I think ultimately he
[1:31:54] wants us as the church to
[1:31:57] know that he's
[1:32:00] ours. We're under his
[1:32:02] authority. Amen. Under his
[1:32:06] authority. I want to be under that. I
[1:32:10] want every action of mind to be under
[1:32:12] that. I want everything that I am. Is
[1:32:16] that your desire here tonight? God bless
[1:32:19] you. God bless
[1:32:22] everyone. You can stand to your feet as
[1:32:25] we get ready to
[1:32:28] dismiss. I want to
[1:32:31] uh remind you they brother Sam has got
[1:32:35] his meeting this
[1:32:38] weekend. So it's going to be Saturday
[1:32:40] night or Friday night, Saturday morning
[1:32:44] and Sunday morning.
[1:32:46] And so we're not going to be dismissing
[1:32:49] here.
[1:32:50] Um, but I plan on making it for the
[1:32:53] Friday night and Saturday morning. And
[1:32:56] um, Brother Sam has always been so good
[1:32:59] to to make our meetings and and and
