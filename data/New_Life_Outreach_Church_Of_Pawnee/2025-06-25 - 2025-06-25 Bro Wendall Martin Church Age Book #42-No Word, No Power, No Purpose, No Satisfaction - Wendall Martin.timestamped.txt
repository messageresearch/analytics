[35:48] for him and and um had a little bit of
[35:51] problems with his insurance and
[35:53] communication between the doctor and the
[35:55] and the pharmacy. And so I offered to go
[35:58] to Tulsa to pick it up for him and and
[36:01] uh he just jumped in the car and and uh
[36:04] we uh my wife and and he and Angie we
[36:09] rode down there together and he it it
[36:11] will be u a week tomorrow that uh um
[36:17] that Huh. Yeah.
[36:21] Okay. Yeah. A week a week yesterday. And
[36:25] so, uh, up he he opened his door getting
[36:29] in and out of the car and everything.
[36:30] And that's a major surgery. And so,
[36:33] we're just thankful to the Lord. Um, he
[36:36] says he's he's but he's he's had a
[36:38] problem sleeping, the medications and
[36:40] things there. That's we're trying to get
[36:42] that all figured out, but he has not
[36:45] been able to sleep hardly at all. And
[36:47] so, I want us to pray that God will
[36:50] allow him to just give him a really good
[36:52] night's rest tonight. And I think that'd
[36:55] be wonderful. Let's let's look here in
[36:57] in 1 Corinthians 5 and 7. When read two
[37:00] verses, purge out therefore the old
[37:02] leaven that ye may be a new lump
[37:08] as ye are unleavened. For even Christ
[37:11] our Passover is sacrificed for us.
[37:15] Therefore, let us keep the feast, not
[37:18] with old leaven, neither with the
[37:20] leavenven of malice and wickedness, but
[37:23] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[37:28] and truth. Amen. Now um and then 2
[37:33] Corinthians 2 and17
[37:37] it says we are not as of as as many
[37:39] which corrupt the word of God but as of
[37:44] sincerity
[37:45] as of God in the sight of God we speak
[37:49] Christ. And so the the reading tonight
[37:53] in the church age book is going to be
[37:55] sincerity to the word of the Lord. And I
[37:58] I I gave it a long title. Amen. Are
[38:01] y'all ready? This is what we're This
[38:03] This is going to be the nut and nut and
[38:05] bolts of it. Amen. There's no if there's
[38:08] no word, there's no power, there's no
[38:11] purpose, no satisfaction.
[38:14] And so, we're going to read tonight in
[38:15] the church age book. Now, if y'all
[38:17] remember the last time we read, we
[38:19] brother Brandham gave a glorious uh
[38:21] review of the church and what what we
[38:24] are and what the where we stand today,
[38:26] the authority of the church. But then
[38:29] he's going to show us this week, amen,
[38:31] on the on on those who have dismissed
[38:34] the word become a powerless church.
[38:37] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[38:38] we want to thank you today for your
[38:41] loving kindness, your tender mercies. We
[38:44] thank you for your word of promise.
[38:46] Thank you for predestination for calling
[38:49] us and ordaining us before the
[38:50] foundation of the world. Now Lord, we
[38:53] just ask that you would speak to our
[38:56] hearts as we read the church age book
[38:58] tonight and just ask Lord that your
[39:01] blessings would be with us and upon us.
[39:03] Father, we'll give you glory and honor
[39:06] in Jesus name we pray. Can the church
[39:08] say amen? And amen. God bless you. You
[39:12] can be seated.
[39:13] Um, all right. So,
[39:16] uh, does anyone have an extra church age
[39:18] book for our friend here? So, you got a
[39:21] church age book? All right. Um,
[39:25] so,
[39:26] um, now I think I think the the
[39:29] leatherbound books are going to be who's
[39:31] who's got the leatherbound or the the
[39:34] red books? Um,
[39:38] do you know do you know that we're on
[39:40] we're on page
[39:43] Okay.
[39:45] Well, well, that's where we're going to
[39:47] start. So, my we're going to start at
[39:50] the messenger of to the Leoysan age.
[39:54] Huh? Okay. So, so in your book that'll
[39:57] be 387. In my book, it's going to be
[40:00] 338.
[40:01] So, those of you who have
[40:04] now um to sort of set to to sort of set
[40:08] your thoughts a little bit tonight uh
[40:11] for what I uh I want us to look at as
[40:14] far as as the um um sincerity,
[40:20] y'all remember the vision that that the
[40:24] prophet had um where he fell into the
[40:26] vision where he he he seen the a map of
[40:31] Palestine.
[40:32] and um he was looking into the promised
[40:35] land coming down to the Jordan River. It
[40:38] was coming into the word. This was just
[40:40] before the opening of the word, the the
[40:42] opening of the seals. And and so he says
[40:45] he was looking across and he says, "Oh,
[40:47] praise God. Uh there's where all the
[40:50] promises lay." And then in the vision,
[40:53] then it went from that and and he he was
[40:56] on a he was on a narrow highway with
[40:59] with with some brother and um and and
[41:03] and he said it it looked like everyone
[41:06] was all afraid and and and he was
[41:08] wondering what what was what was um
[41:12] what's everyone scared of? And there was
[41:14] a voice that said um there there's such
[41:16] danger in these days. There's a great
[41:20] hideous thing that's death when it
[41:22] strikes you. And he says, "I heard the
[41:24] weeds amashing down and I looked and
[41:27] there was a huge monster snake crawling
[41:29] through the weeds." Now, knowing this is
[41:32] a vision, he said, "I I I'll see what
[41:35] this animal or this beast is." And he
[41:38] says he crawled up on the highway and as
[41:40] soon as I got sight of him, I knew it
[41:42] was a mamba. And and so he he started
[41:45] talking about how the mamba was the
[41:46] deadliest of snakes. and and and and was
[41:49] going through that and and and he said
[41:52] that it was that the mamba will kill you
[41:54] like right now. You you be it it strikes
[41:57] you, you've just got a few seconds and
[41:59] and and you die. He says when the when
[42:02] when the natives see the snakes over
[42:03] there, they'll butt their heads together
[42:05] and just start screaming because they're
[42:07] so they just they get up on their tail
[42:09] and they and they chase you and and um
[42:12] when they strike you, they kill you. And
[42:15] so the vision was that he says as the
[42:17] snake was getting up closer to him this
[42:20] everyone was running but it turned on to
[42:22] him and and as it got closer to him it
[42:25] there was something that was protecting
[42:27] him and then it turned to his friend who
[42:30] and and and went after him and then
[42:31] brother Brandham screamed out oh God
[42:34] it's going to kill him you've got to you
[42:36] you've got to help him and and um as he
[42:40] he says I threw my hands up as it was
[42:43] just striking at And I said, "Oh God,
[42:45] have mercy on my brother. If that
[42:47] serpent ever strike him, it'll kill
[42:49] him." He says, "And just then the
[42:51] serpent turned to me when I said that
[42:53] and it looked at me again and a voice
[42:56] come from heaven, come from above me and
[42:58] said, you have been given power to bind
[43:01] him or the worst or any." I said, "Well,
[43:05] God, what must I do?" And he said,
[43:07] "There's one thing you must do. You must
[43:11] be more sincere.
[43:14] You must be more sincere. I said, "Well,
[43:17] God, forgive me of my insincerity. Let
[43:20] me have sincerity." When I raised my
[43:21] hands up to him again, there was a great
[43:24] something came over me and just lifted
[43:26] me up. And it seemed like my whole body
[43:28] was charged with something. And I looked
[43:31] at that serpent. And then when he
[43:32] started towards me, he couldn't do it
[43:34] yet. And I said, "Satan, in the name of
[43:37] the Lord Jesus, I bind you." And the
[43:40] serpent, the blue smoke flew out of him
[43:42] and he curled up and u and and then
[43:46] brother Brandham would go on down. He
[43:48] says, "And then when he when he did
[43:50] that, this is going on down after, you
[43:52] know, after he defeated this the
[43:54] serpent, that voice said, now you must
[43:56] be more sincere than what you are to do
[43:59] this." Now, this was this was in um this
[44:04] here was in well, let me get back up to
[44:07] it. It was in paradox uh there in in
[44:12] December of of 61. And if you'll go back
[44:15] to the chronological order, you will
[44:17] find that that brother that that God is
[44:19] really preparing brother Brandham for
[44:21] the opening of these seals. And so,
[44:23] there are visions that are coming in
[44:25] just one after another. And so uh he he
[44:29] is preparing for the for the opening of
[44:31] the word and that voice is letting him
[44:34] know that what is coming it this word
[44:37] that is coming in order for this word to
[44:40] be effective you have don't miss don't
[44:44] miss what is fixing to take place and so
[44:46] he's telling brother Brandham be more
[44:49] sincere and and so um he says it must be
[44:54] more sincere and then it left me and I
[44:56] was standing in the room a few moments.
[44:57] I heard a cloak go clock go off. My wife
[45:00] got up and um and the children, you know
[45:03] how it is. I guess it's your house. Um
[45:06] you know what am I going to wear today,
[45:07] mama? And this that and the other. And
[45:09] so he he goes on down and and um and he
[45:13] opens up a Bible and it comes open to 1
[45:15] Corinthians 5 and 8. And he says um he
[45:19] says, "I was planning on taking a fast
[45:21] to the Lord. I told him I'd go out and
[45:23] fast." And it said, "When you come to
[45:25] this fast, a fast and body is a feast
[45:28] with the Lord." It says, "So when you
[45:30] come to this feast, don't come with the
[45:32] old leavenven of malice and so forth,
[45:34] but come with the unleavened bread of
[45:37] sincerity and truth." And so I want us
[45:41] to look at this as as as we look at the
[45:45] at the pronouncement of judgment upon
[45:47] this generation. And I want you to
[45:49] understand that the what what God is
[45:51] doing because brother Brandon will tell
[45:53] us how that the mouthpiece has God has
[45:56] raised up throughout all seven ages.
[45:58] He's raised up uh uh uh churches. Amen.
[46:01] Raised up groups down all through the
[46:04] through the age. And in this last age,
[46:07] God was going to spew this last church
[46:10] out of his mouth as as we've read there
[46:12] in Revelations. But again, brother
[46:15] Brandham is saying there will be an
[46:17] elect that is going to be sincere with
[46:21] that word that the word will have an
[46:24] effect in. It will not be for the age.
[46:26] The age is going to be spewing out of
[46:28] his mouth. It will be to the overcomer.
[46:31] And I want us to really look at this as
[46:33] we look at it. Amen. So let's look here
[46:36] in in page 338 now.
[46:39] Um, and it's it's Revelations um um
[46:44] let's see, let's not read that whole
[46:46] thing there. Let's let's just go on down
[46:49] there. It'll be uh 1 2 3. Let's go down
[46:51] to the third paragraph.
[46:54] Well, for those that are Let's Let's
[46:55] just start right there. Message to the
[46:56] Leodysian age. Uh Revelations 3:15. I
[46:59] know thy works. Thou art neither cold
[47:02] nor hot. I would thou were cold or hot.
[47:05] So then, because thou art lukewarm,
[47:07] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[47:09] out of my mouth. Now again, this keep
[47:12] sincerity in mind, because thou sayest,
[47:15] I'm rich and increased with goods, have
[47:17] need of nothing. Knowest not that thou
[47:20] art wretched, miserable, poor, blind,
[47:24] naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[47:26] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[47:29] rich and white reignment that thou
[47:31] mayest be clothed that the shame of thy
[47:34] nakedness do not appear. Anoint thine
[47:37] eyes with eyes that thou mayest see. As
[47:40] many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be
[47:44] zealous, therefore, and repent.
[47:46] As we have read this together, I'm sure
[47:48] that you have noticed that the spirit
[47:50] has not said one kind thing about this
[47:53] age. He makes two indictments
[47:57] and pronounces his sentence upon them.
[47:59] One, Revelations 15-16.
[48:03] I know thy works that thou art neither
[48:05] cold nor hot. I would thou work cold or
[48:08] hot, but because thou art lukewarm,
[48:12] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[48:14] out of my mouth. We're going to look at
[48:16] this carefully. It says that this
[48:19] church, this Leoian church age group is
[48:21] lukewarm. This lukewarmness demands a
[48:24] penalty from God. The penalty is that
[48:29] they will be spewed out of his mouth.
[48:31] Here is where we don't want to go astray
[48:33] as a lot of folks do. They very unwisely
[48:37] say that God can spew you out of his
[48:39] mouth. And that proves if there is no
[48:41] such thing as any truth to the doctrine
[48:44] of perseverance of the saint or yeah uh
[48:48] perseverance of the saints.
[48:50] I want to correct your thinking right
[48:52] now. This verse is not given to an
[48:55] individual. It's given to the church. He
[48:59] is talking to the church. Furthermore,
[49:02] if you will just keep the word in in
[49:05] mind, you will recall that nowhere does
[49:08] it say that we are in the mouth of God.
[49:11] We are engraved in his palms. We are
[49:13] carried in his bosom. Way back in the
[49:16] unknown ages before time, we were in his
[49:18] mind. We are his or in his sheepfold in
[49:23] his pastures, but never in his mouth.
[49:27] What What is in the mouth of the Lord?
[49:31] The word is in his mouth. Matthew 4:4.
[49:34] But he answered and said, "It is
[49:36] written, man shall not live by bread
[49:37] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[49:40] out of the mouth of God, and the word is
[49:43] to be in our mouths, too."
[49:47] Now we know the church is his body and
[49:50] it is here taking his place. What will
[49:54] be in the mouth of the church? The word.
[49:57] Now to me this is powerful. 1 Peter
[50:00] 4:11. If any man speak let him speak as
[50:05] the oracles word of God. 2 Peter 1:21.
[50:09] For prophecy came not in the old time by
[50:12] the will of man, but holy men of God
[50:16] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[50:18] Ghost. Then what is wrong with these
[50:20] people of the last day? They have gotten
[50:23] away from the word. They are no longer
[50:27] fervent about it. They are lukewarm
[50:30] about it. And I'm going to prove that
[50:33] right now. So, so I the sincerity is no
[50:37] longer there. It's just it's it's just
[50:42] it's word, but it doesn't mean just a
[50:45] whole lot to them. Um, now I do you all
[50:48] do you all have church age books back
[50:50] there? I I was going to say there's
[50:52] there's a church age book right here. I
[50:54] don't know um if I don't if y'all if
[50:57] someone Well, there's two of them here.
[50:59] So, if anyone wants to read these, got
[51:01] to make sure we put them back. But, if
[51:03] uh y'all want these uh I am on Let's
[51:07] see. We're I'm on page 339 now and I'm
[51:10] going to be at the first paragraph. Uh
[51:12] in the red books, what what's
[51:16] Yes, that's the blue
[51:18] 388 uh for the for the other.
[51:23] So, so again,
[51:26] y'all seeing this here, it's not that
[51:28] the word is not here. It's that the word
[51:32] is taken lightly. And this is where
[51:35] there is nobody in this age including
[51:39] new life that is exempt.
[51:43] Amen. God is not calling churches. God
[51:47] is not calling groups. He's not calling
[51:50] message people. He's calling
[51:52] individuals.
[51:54] And we've got to make sure we've got
[51:56] fire in our hearts for the word of God.
[52:00] Amen. Now,
[52:03] so we're in page 339 of the blue books
[52:07] and 389 in the in the red book. He says,
[52:10] "The Baptists have their creeds and
[52:13] dogmas based on the word, and you can't
[52:15] shake them. They say the apostolic days
[52:18] of miracles are over. There's no baptism
[52:21] with the Holy Ghost subsequent to
[52:23] believing." The Methodists say based on
[52:25] the word, there is no water baptism.
[52:28] Sprinkling is not baptism. that
[52:31] sanctification is the baptism with the
[52:33] Holy Ghost.
[52:36] The Church of Christ majors in
[52:37] regenerational baptism and in all too
[52:40] many cases they go down dry centers and
[52:42] come up wet ones. Yet they claim their
[52:45] doctrine is word-based. Right? They go
[52:48] right down the line and come to the
[52:50] Pentecostals. Do they have the word?
[52:53] Well, give them the word test and see.
[52:55] They will sell out the word for a
[52:57] sensation just about every time. If you
[53:00] can produce a manifestation like oil and
[53:02] blood and tongues and other signs,
[53:04] whether in the word or not, or whether
[53:06] properly interpreted from the word, the
[53:08] majority will fall for it. But what
[53:10] happened to the word? The word has been
[53:13] put aside. So God says, "I'm going
[53:16] against you all. I will spew you out of
[53:19] my mouth. This is the end.
[53:23] For seven out of seven ages, I have seen
[53:25] nothing but men esteeming their word
[53:27] above mine." So at the end of this age,
[53:31] I'm spewing you out of my mouth. It is
[53:33] all over. I'm going to speak. All right.
[53:37] Yes, I'm here in the midst of the
[53:38] church. The amen of God, the faithful
[53:41] and true, will reveal himself, and it
[53:44] will be by my prophet. Oh yes, that is
[53:46] so. In Revelations 10:7, in the days of
[53:50] the voice of the seventh messenger, when
[53:52] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
[53:54] God shall be finished, as he hath
[53:56] declared to his servants the prophets.
[53:58] There it is. He is sending a vindicated
[54:01] prophet, sending a prophet after almost
[54:03] 2,000 years. He is sending someone who
[54:06] is so far from organization, education,
[54:09] and the world of religion that is John
[54:12] the Baptist and and Elijah of old. He
[54:16] will hear from God and he will have thus
[54:18] sayaeth the Lord and speak for God. He
[54:23] will be God's mouthpiece and he as it is
[54:26] declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the
[54:30] hearts of the children back to the
[54:32] fathers. He will bring back the elect of
[54:35] the last days. They will hear a
[54:38] vindicated prophet give the exact truth
[54:42] as it was with Paul. He will restore the
[54:45] truth as they had it. And those elect
[54:48] with him in that day will be the ones
[54:53] who truly manifest the Lord and be his
[54:57] body and be his voice and perform his
[55:01] works. Hallelujah. Do you see it? Now,
[55:05] he's and he's he's making this clear
[55:06] now. You got you got to be fervent about
[55:09] this. God's going to send his word and
[55:13] there will be an elect that that word is
[55:17] going to have its its effect in. He says
[55:21] a momentary
[55:23] consideration of the church history will
[55:25] prove how accurate this thought is. In
[55:28] the dark ages, the word was almost
[55:30] entirely lost to the people. But God
[55:33] sent Luther with the word. The Lutheran
[55:36] spoke for God at that time. But they
[55:38] organized and again the pure word was
[55:40] lost for organization tends toward dogma
[55:43] and creeds and not simple word. They
[55:45] could no longer speak for God. Then God
[55:48] sent Wesley and and he was the voice
[55:52] with the word in his day. The people who
[55:54] took his revelation from God become
[55:56] living epistles read and known of all
[55:58] men for that generation.
[56:00] When the Methodists failed, God raised
[56:02] up others. And so it has gone through
[56:04] the years until in this last day there
[56:07] is again another people. Someone say
[56:10] hallelujah
[56:12] in the land who under their messenger
[56:14] will be the final voice to the final
[56:17] age. Yes sir. The church is no longer
[56:21] the mouthpiece of God. It is its own
[56:24] mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He
[56:26] will confound her through the prophet
[56:29] and the bride. For the voice of God will
[56:32] be in her. Yes, it is. For it says in
[56:35] the last chapter of Revelations, verse
[56:37] 17, the spirit and the bride say, "Come
[56:42] once more. The world will hear from God
[56:45] as at Pentecost." But of course, the
[56:48] word bride will be repudiated as in the
[56:51] first age. Now, he has cried out in this
[56:54] last age. You have word. You have more
[56:56] Bibles than ever. But you are doing
[56:59] nothing about the word except dividing
[57:02] and hacking it into pieces. Taking what
[57:04] you want, leaving out what you don't
[57:07] want. You are not interested in living
[57:10] it, but debating it. I would sooner. You
[57:13] were hot or cold. If you're cold and
[57:16] rejected it, if you were if you were
[57:19] cold and rejected it, I could stand
[57:20] that. But if you uh get white hot to
[57:25] know its truth and live it, I would
[57:27] praise you for that. But when you simply
[57:29] take my word, don't honor it, I in
[57:33] return must refuse to honor you. I will
[57:36] spew you out uh for you nauseate me.
[57:40] Now, anybody knows that it is lukewarm
[57:42] water that makes you sick at the
[57:44] stomach. If you need uh if you need an
[57:48] enema emitic or whatever that I think
[57:50] it's eminent or no maybe that's not it.
[57:53] Whatever that word is lukewarm water is
[57:56] about the best thing to drink. A
[57:58] lukewarm church
[58:00] has made God sick and he has declared he
[58:03] will spew spew it out. Reminds us how he
[58:06] felt just before the flood, doesn't it?
[58:09] Oh would to God the church were cold or
[58:12] hot. Best of all, she should be fervent
[58:14] hot. But she is not. Sentence has been
[58:18] passed. She is no longer God's voice to
[58:21] the world. She will maintain that she
[58:22] is, but God says not. Oh God. Oh God
[58:27] still has a voice for the people of the
[58:29] world. Even as he has given a voice to
[58:32] the bride. That voice is in the bride as
[58:36] we have said and we will talk more about
[58:39] that later. two, Revelations 3:17 and
[58:43] 18. Because thou sayest, I'm rich,
[58:45] increased with goods, have need of
[58:47] nothing, knowest not that thou art
[58:49] wretched, miserable, poor, and blind,
[58:52] and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me
[58:55] gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest
[58:57] be rich, and white raignment, that thou
[58:59] mayest be clothed, that the shame of thy
[59:01] nakedness do not appear, and anoint
[59:04] thine eyes with thy eyes, that thou
[59:05] mayest see.
[59:07] Now look at the first phrase of this
[59:09] verse. because thou sayest. See, they
[59:12] were speaking. They were talking as the
[59:15] mouthpiece of God. This proves exactly
[59:18] what I said in six verses 16 and 17.
[59:21] Men,
[59:23] but they say it uh uh but though they
[59:26] say it, that does not make it right. The
[59:30] Catholic Church says she speaks for God,
[59:32] saying that she is the assured voice of
[59:34] the Lord. How many people can be so
[59:37] spiritually wicked? Uh how any people
[59:41] can be so spiritually wicked is more
[59:43] than I know. But they produce according
[59:46] to the seed which is in them. And we
[59:48] know where the seed came from, don't we?
[59:51] The leodysian church is saying, "I'm
[59:53] rich and increase with goods and have
[59:56] need of nothing." That was her
[59:58] self-estimate.
[1:00:00] She looked at herself and that is what
[1:00:03] she saw. She said, "I'm rich." which
[1:00:06] means that she is wealthy in the things
[1:00:07] of this world. She is boasting in the
[1:00:10] face of James 2:5-7.
[1:00:13] Hearken, my beloved brethren, hath not
[1:00:16] God chosen the poor of this world, rich
[1:00:19] in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which
[1:00:22] he hath promised to them that love him?
[1:00:24] But ye have despised the poor. Do not
[1:00:27] rich men oppress you, and draw you
[1:00:30] before the judgment seats? Do not they
[1:00:32] blasphe the worthy name by which ye are
[1:00:35] called? Now I do not suggest that a rich
[1:00:38] person cannot be spiritual. But we all
[1:00:40] know that the word says very few are. It
[1:00:44] is to the poor that predominate
[1:00:49] in the body of the true church. Now then
[1:00:52] if the church becomes full of wealth, we
[1:00:55] know only one thing. Incabad it has been
[1:00:58] written over her portals. You can't deny
[1:01:01] that. For that is the word. Talk about
[1:01:04] wealth in the church. Why there why
[1:01:07] there has never been uh such a show of
[1:01:10] wealth? Beautiful sanctuaries are
[1:01:13] multiplied in numbers as never before.
[1:01:15] The various groups vy with each other to
[1:01:18] see who can build the biggest and the
[1:01:20] loveliest. They build education centers
[1:01:23] worth unestimated millions. And those
[1:01:26] church those buildings are only used an
[1:01:29] hour or two a week. Now that would that
[1:01:32] would not be such a terrible thing but
[1:01:35] they expect uh this little time spent by
[1:01:38] the children in the education plan to
[1:01:41] take the place of hours of training
[1:01:43] supposed to be given in the home. Money
[1:01:46] has poured into the church until
[1:01:48] different denominations own stocks and
[1:01:50] bonds, factories, oil wells, insurance
[1:01:53] companies. They have poured money into
[1:01:56] welfare and retirement funds. Now, this
[1:01:59] sounds good, but it has become a snare
[1:02:01] to the ministers. For if they decide to
[1:02:04] leave that group for more light or the
[1:02:06] love of God, their pensions are lost to
[1:02:08] them. Most can't stand this and stay
[1:02:11] with their pressure groups. Now, don't
[1:02:14] forget that is this last that uh don't
[1:02:18] forget that this is the last age. We
[1:02:21] know that this is the last age because
[1:02:24] Israel has gone back to Palestine.
[1:02:27] If we believe that he is really coming,
[1:02:29] then there must be something wrong with
[1:02:31] those who are building so vastly. It
[1:02:34] makes one think that these people plan
[1:02:36] on staying here forever or that the
[1:02:38] coming of Jesus is hundreds of years
[1:02:40] off. Do you know that religion today is
[1:02:45] known as big business? It is an absolute
[1:02:48] fact that they are placing uh business
[1:02:51] managers in the churches to take care of
[1:02:53] finances. Is that what God desires? Did
[1:02:57] God not teach us in the book of Acts
[1:02:59] that seven men full of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:01] and faith serve the Lord in the business
[1:03:04] matters? You can surely see why God
[1:03:07] said, "You say you are wealthy." I never
[1:03:11] said so. There are radio programs and
[1:03:14] television programs and numerous church
[1:03:16] endeavors that are costing millions and
[1:03:19] millions of dollars. Wealth pours and
[1:03:22] pours into the church and membership
[1:03:23] increases along with the money. Yet the
[1:03:26] work is not being done as it was done
[1:03:28] when there was no money. For men rested
[1:03:32] solely on the ability given them by the
[1:03:36] Holy Ghost. And how many can say amen to
[1:03:38] that? If that was true back then,
[1:03:43] what about today?
[1:03:45] Those were little. See, back then it was
[1:03:47] Oral Roberts. Y'all remember Or Roberts?
[1:03:49] What was his what was his favorite line?
[1:03:51] His is uh uh God is a good God. God is a
[1:03:55] good God. And then Brother Oral Roberts
[1:03:58] is the one that started the the slogan
[1:04:00] um um
[1:04:05] has something to do with it was the seed
[1:04:07] seed money.
[1:04:09] Yeah. Sew the plant plant a seed and and
[1:04:13] and and reap a miracle. But it was but
[1:04:15] it he was using the s he was using the
[1:04:18] natural money. Give the natural money
[1:04:20] and then God will bless you. And so, uh,
[1:04:24] this modern-day evangel or a modern-day,
[1:04:26] um, uh, uh,
[1:04:31] TV evangelist or Robert started that and
[1:04:34] and it was you give, God's a good God,
[1:04:36] and you give and God will give back to
[1:04:38] you. I and and and for on another note,
[1:04:41] y'all remember um brother Michael and
[1:04:44] Kobe and Caleb might remember y'all when
[1:04:47] we all wanted m um we we wanted to get
[1:04:50] the uh put the tent up over in Tulsa.
[1:04:54] And so um and all the young preachers
[1:04:56] were going to preach Jonathan and um so
[1:04:59] we were trying we we were trying to find
[1:05:01] us a place. So, we found us a place over
[1:05:03] in the Hispanic part of the and I mean
[1:05:05] it was where the gangs were and we were
[1:05:07] we we were looking around and do you
[1:05:10] realize that those guys uh and and it
[1:05:13] was rough over there and and and so we
[1:05:16] would ask if we can if if we can you
[1:05:20] know use their property uh to set up a
[1:05:23] tent for the weekend or for the week. we
[1:05:25] want was going to have a tent revival
[1:05:28] and uh and these guys would want to
[1:05:30] charge us like three or $4,000
[1:05:33] uh uh for a couple of days and and I say
[1:05:36] listen we don't have that kind of money
[1:05:38] we are simply trying to come in and help
[1:05:41] the community and and this one guy said
[1:05:44] it all he says you guys he says I know
[1:05:47] the way you Christians are you wouldn't
[1:05:50] be doing it if you weren't making money
[1:05:54] that's exactly ly what he said. I said,
[1:05:56] "We're not we're we're not even going to
[1:05:58] take an offering. We're not even taking
[1:06:01] an offering. We're trying to help you
[1:06:03] with these gangs." And he says, "No, no,
[1:06:06] no. There is nobody preaching today
[1:06:09] unless they can make some money." And he
[1:06:12] said, "And I want in on it." And I
[1:06:14] thought, "Oh my goodness." Amen. So,
[1:06:17] we'll just we'll just let your community
[1:06:19] go to hell in a hand basket. Amen. But
[1:06:22] so, but they did. No one wanted to no
[1:06:26] one wanted to let us set up over there
[1:06:29] and that community really needed it. And
[1:06:31] maybe the Lord was saving us from
[1:06:33] getting shot or something. I don't know.
[1:06:36] But it was but but I thought it was
[1:06:38] something. That's the way people
[1:06:40] perceive the gospel. Isn't that sad? But
[1:06:43] again, while while this is all going
[1:06:45] through there, remember there's going to
[1:06:47] be somebody sincere with this word and
[1:06:49] that word is going to live through us.
[1:06:52] Amen. All right. So, let's continue on.
[1:06:55] Let's see. Um,
[1:06:58] where did I stop?
[1:07:04] Okay. So, uh, yes. So, I'm going to go
[1:07:08] back up again. There are radio programs,
[1:07:10] television programs, numerous church
[1:07:12] endeavors that are costing millions and
[1:07:14] millions of dollars. Wealth pours and
[1:07:16] pours into the church. The membership
[1:07:18] increases along with the money. Yet the
[1:07:20] work is not being done as it was done
[1:07:23] when there was no money. Men rested
[1:07:26] solely upon the ability given them by
[1:07:29] the Holy Ghost. There are paid
[1:07:31] preachers, paid assistants, paid
[1:07:33] ministers of music and education, paid
[1:07:35] choirs, paid custodians, programs and
[1:07:38] entertainment, all costing great sums.
[1:07:41] But for all of that, the power is
[1:07:43] decreasing. Yes, the church is rich, but
[1:07:46] the power is not there. God moves by his
[1:07:49] spirit, not by the amount of money or
[1:07:52] talent in the church. Can I hear an
[1:07:54] amen? Now, I want to show you how
[1:07:56] diabolical this urge for money has
[1:07:59] become. The churches have gone out to
[1:08:03] get a membership, especially of the
[1:08:04] wealthy. Everywhere there is a cry to
[1:08:07] make religion so attractive and
[1:08:10] appealing that the rich and cultured and
[1:08:13] all who have worldly prestige will come
[1:08:15] in and be active in the church. Can't
[1:08:18] they understand that if wealth is the
[1:08:20] criterion of spirituality, then the
[1:08:23] world already has God, has all of God,
[1:08:26] and the church has nothing. Thou sayest,
[1:08:29] I'm increased with goods. This literally
[1:08:31] means, I have spiritual riches. This
[1:08:34] sounds like the millennium with streets
[1:08:36] of gold and the presence of God. But I
[1:08:39] wonder if that is so. Is the church
[1:08:42] truly rich in the spiritual things of
[1:08:44] God? Let us examine this 20 20th century
[1:08:48] leoty and boast in the light of the
[1:08:49] word. If the church were truly
[1:08:52] spiritually rich, its influence would be
[1:08:55] felt upon community life. That that that
[1:08:58] hit me when I read that. If the church
[1:09:02] is truly spiritually rich, its influence
[1:09:04] would be felt upon the community life.
[1:09:06] Lord, let let me give Lord let your
[1:09:09] light let me live in such a walk with
[1:09:12] you that the community has to say that
[1:09:16] is a believer.
[1:09:18] Amen. A community has to say I remember
[1:09:22] I remember when they brought that that
[1:09:24] baby into us. Y'all y'all remember that
[1:09:26] uh when they brought that baby in the
[1:09:28] community and had snot all over its face
[1:09:31] and and it had a it had breathing uh uh
[1:09:35] uh oxygen stuff on it and you know and
[1:09:38] and um he was like two years old or may
[1:09:41] maybe between one and two and um and he
[1:09:45] had asthma and and and we all gathered
[1:09:48] together and prayed for that child and
[1:09:51] how the Lord come down and immediately
[1:09:54] touched that child. Now, they never
[1:09:56] brought the child. They never started
[1:09:58] coming to church here. Never did. They
[1:10:00] went back to their church. But did you
[1:10:02] know that that baby was healed from that
[1:10:04] time on that God touched them? Amen.
[1:10:07] Y'all y'all remember when we had our uh
[1:10:10] in in CO and and that one uh lady had
[1:10:13] had problem with her with her ears and
[1:10:16] how God healed her. Do you know that God
[1:10:19] genuinely touched her ears and healed?
[1:10:21] She didn't come back in. But the she
[1:10:24] didn't start joining our church. But
[1:10:26] here's the thing. There's a witness that
[1:10:29] this word is alive. And that witness
[1:10:33] must be in every home. It must be on our
[1:10:36] job, the community. Wherever we're at,
[1:10:39] they need to know that Christ is with
[1:10:42] us.
[1:10:43] Or not with us, with his word. Not with
[1:10:46] us, his word. And when you honor the
[1:10:49] word, the word will honor you. And
[1:10:52] that's the thing. There's where
[1:10:53] sincerity is. It's not about me and it's
[1:10:56] not about you. It's about honoring that
[1:10:59] word in our lives. Amen. All right. He
[1:11:03] says, "But exactly what kind of lives
[1:11:06] are these so-called spiritual
[1:11:08] influential men of the community living
[1:11:11] out in the suburbans, out in the better
[1:11:14] class dis uh the better class districts.
[1:11:17] There abounds wife swapping,
[1:11:19] prostitution, bands of children,
[1:11:21] crashing parties, exacting a a terrible
[1:11:24] toll on property damage. Immorality has
[1:11:28] reached an all-time high in the uh
[1:11:31] promiscuous
[1:11:33] sex acts and narcotic addiction,
[1:11:35] gambling, stealing, all kinds of evil.
[1:11:38] And the church goes on claiming how fine
[1:11:41] is this generation. How full are the
[1:11:44] churches and how responsive are even the
[1:11:46] natives on the mission fields? the the
[1:11:49] church has turned the people over to
[1:11:51] doctors, especially the psychiatrists,
[1:11:53] and how it can pray about being rich
[1:11:56] spiritually is more than I know. It
[1:11:59] isn't true. They are bankrupt and they
[1:12:02] know it. That is a mouthful. That thing
[1:12:06] we should ask the Lord when we're
[1:12:07] praying, Lord, don't let this happen. I
[1:12:11] sin is approaching. God, let me be
[1:12:14] reaching out. Let me be re reaching out
[1:12:16] to those who need the help. Can you say
[1:12:18] amen? Amen. It says, "Take a good look
[1:12:21] around you. Examine the people as they
[1:12:23] walk by. In the multitudes you see, you
[1:12:26] can pick out those that have the
[1:12:27] appearance of Christians. Or can you
[1:12:30] pick out those that have the appearance
[1:12:31] of Christians? How? Watch how they
[1:12:34] dress. Watch how they act. Hear what
[1:12:36] they say. See where they go. Surely
[1:12:39] there ought to be some real evidence of
[1:12:41] the new birth amongst all those that we
[1:12:43] see go by, but few there be. Yet today
[1:12:47] the fundamental churches are telling us
[1:12:49] they have millions saved and even
[1:12:51] spiritfilled. Spiritfilled. Can you call
[1:12:55] women spiritfilled that go around with
[1:12:57] frizzy bobbed hair and shorts and slacks
[1:12:59] and halters and briefs and all painted
[1:13:02] up like jezebounds? If they are adorned
[1:13:04] in the modest apparel as becometh the
[1:13:06] church Christian woman, I would hate to
[1:13:09] think that it would be what it would be
[1:13:11] like if I had to witness a display of
[1:13:13] immodesty. Now, I I know that women
[1:13:17] don't set the styles. Hollywood does.
[1:13:19] But listen, ladies, you still sell the
[1:13:22] yard goods. They they still sell the
[1:13:24] yard goods and sewing machines. You
[1:13:26] don't have to buy what's in the stores
[1:13:27] and then use them as an excuse. This is
[1:13:30] a deadly serious manner that I'm going
[1:13:32] into. You have, have you not read in the
[1:13:35] scripture that when a man looks upon a
[1:13:37] woman and lust after her in his heart,
[1:13:39] he has already committed adultery with
[1:13:41] her in his heart? And suppose you
[1:13:44] dressed in such a way as to cause that
[1:13:47] that makes you partner in sin. Even
[1:13:50] though you would be absolutely aware of
[1:13:52] it, unaware of it. Being a true virgin
[1:13:56] with no such desires, yet God holds you
[1:13:59] accountable and you will be judged. Now
[1:14:02] I know you ladies don't like this kind
[1:14:04] of preaching, but sister, you are dead
[1:14:06] wrong in what you are doing. The Bible
[1:14:09] forbids you to cut your hair. God gave
[1:14:11] it to you for a covering. He gave a
[1:14:14] command for you to wear it long. It is
[1:14:16] your glory. And when you cut your hair,
[1:14:19] you signified that you left the headship
[1:14:22] of your husband. Like Eve, you walked
[1:14:25] out and went your on your own. You you
[1:14:29] got the vote.
[1:14:31] You took the men's jobs. You left off
[1:14:33] being females. You ought to repent and
[1:14:36] come back to God. And if all this wasn't
[1:14:39] bad enough, the whole lot of you took
[1:14:41] the idea that you would invade could
[1:14:43] invade the pulpits and the church
[1:14:45] offices that God reserved for men and
[1:14:48] for men only. Oh, I touched a sore spot
[1:14:51] then, didn't I? Well, show me one place
[1:14:54] in the Bible that God ever ordained a
[1:14:56] woman to preach or take authority over
[1:14:58] the man, and I will apologize for what I
[1:15:01] have said. You can't find that I'm
[1:15:03] wrong. I'm right. For I stand with the
[1:15:06] word and in the word. If you're
[1:15:09] spiritually rich, you would know that is
[1:15:12] true. There is nothing true but the
[1:15:15] word. Paul said, "I suffer not a woman
[1:15:17] to teach, nor usurp authority over the
[1:15:19] man." You can't possibly take a place
[1:15:22] among the five-fold ministry of
[1:15:24] Ephesians 4 and not take authority over
[1:15:26] men. Sister, you had better listen to
[1:15:30] that word. It was not the spirit of God
[1:15:32] manifesting
[1:15:34] uh manifesting in spiritfilled life that
[1:15:37] told you to preach because the spirit
[1:15:39] and the word are one. They say the same
[1:15:42] thing. Somebody made a mistake. Somebody
[1:15:45] was fooled. Wake up before it's too
[1:15:47] late. Uh Satan fooled Eve, your mother.
[1:15:51] He's fooling the daughters now. May God
[1:15:54] help us. I have need of nothing. Now
[1:15:57] when somebody says I have need of
[1:15:59] nothing, he could very well be saying I
[1:16:02] have everything or he could be saying I
[1:16:05] don't want anymore
[1:16:07] uh as I am full now. You can express
[1:16:11] this in any way you want. It all adds up
[1:16:13] to the fact that the church is
[1:16:14] complacent. She is satisfied with what
[1:16:17] she has. She e she's either figures that
[1:16:21] she has it all or has enough. And that
[1:16:24] is exactly what we find today. What
[1:16:26] denom what denomination is not claiming
[1:16:29] that it has the revelation and the power
[1:16:32] and the truth? Listen to the Baptist
[1:16:36] and and and uh and they have it all. Uh
[1:16:41] listen to the Methodists and they have
[1:16:42] it all. Listen to the church of Christ.
[1:16:44] Everyone is wrong but them. Hear what
[1:16:47] the Pentecostals say. They have the
[1:16:49] fullness of the fullness. Now they know
[1:16:51] I am telling the truth about them. for
[1:16:54] not one of their manuals say any
[1:16:56] different. They wrote it all out uh just
[1:17:00] so nice and put their names to it and
[1:17:02] finished it all up. God just doesn't
[1:17:04] have uh God just doesn't have anymore.
[1:17:08] There are those who just don't want it
[1:17:11] anymore. They do not believe in healing
[1:17:14] and would not want it although the
[1:17:16] although it is in the word. There are
[1:17:18] those who would not take the Holy Spirit
[1:17:21] if God opened the heavens and showed
[1:17:23] them a sign. Now they are all saying and
[1:17:27] trying to prove that they have it all or
[1:17:30] they have enough. Yet is that the truth?
[1:17:34] Compare this with the 20th century
[1:17:35] church, this 20th century church to the
[1:17:37] first century church. Go ahead, do that.
[1:17:40] Where is the power? Where is the love?
[1:17:43] Where is the purified church that
[1:17:45] withstood sin and walked with faith
[1:17:47] toward Jesus? Where is the unity? You
[1:17:50] can't find it. If this church has it
[1:17:52] all, has all it needs, why were they
[1:17:55] crying out for more of God in the book
[1:17:57] of Acts? As though they didn't have it
[1:18:00] all, yet they had they had far more than
[1:18:04] they have today. God's diagnosis.
[1:18:08] Now, what God saw was
[1:18:11] um let's see. Yeah, we'll go and we'll
[1:18:14] read a couple more pages. Are y'all
[1:18:15] y'all ready for a couple more pages?
[1:18:17] Now, what God saw was entirely different
[1:18:20] from what they saw. They said they were
[1:18:23] rich in goods and spiritually wealthy.
[1:18:25] They had arrived. They had need of
[1:18:28] nothing. But God saw it otherwise. He
[1:18:31] said, "You don't know this, but you are
[1:18:33] wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and
[1:18:36] naked." Now, when a when a people are
[1:18:39] that way, especially naked, and don't
[1:18:41] know it, there has to be something
[1:18:43] awfully wrong. Surely, something must be
[1:18:47] happening. Is it not that God has
[1:18:49] blinded their eyes as he did the Jews?
[1:18:52] Is the gospel going back to the Jews? Is
[1:18:55] history repeating itself? I say it is.
[1:18:58] God says this church of the Leoysian age
[1:19:01] is wretched. That word comes from two
[1:19:03] Greek words which means endure and
[1:19:06] trial. It has nothing to do with the
[1:19:08] trials that come to a true Christian.
[1:19:11] For God describes a Christian in trial
[1:19:13] as blessed and as attitude one of joy.
[1:19:17] Whereas this description is phrased as
[1:19:20] wretched and miserable. How strange. In
[1:19:23] this age of plenty, in this age of
[1:19:26] progress, in this age of abundance, how
[1:19:29] can there be trials?
[1:19:32] Well, now it it is strange, but in this
[1:19:36] age of plenty and opportunity when
[1:19:39] everyone has so much and there is so
[1:19:42] much more to be had. I think this is
[1:19:44] good. This is powerful through here.
[1:19:47] What with all the inventions to do our
[1:19:50] work and so many things to give us
[1:19:53] pleasure, suddenly we find mental
[1:19:57] illness taking such a toll as to alarm
[1:19:59] the nation when everybody ought to be
[1:20:02] happy with really nothing to be unhappy
[1:20:05] about. Millions are taking s uh
[1:20:08] sedatives at night, pep pills in the
[1:20:11] morning, rushing to the doctors,
[1:20:13] entering institutions, and trying to
[1:20:16] drown out unknown fears by alcohol. Yet
[1:20:19] this age boasts of its tremendous stores
[1:20:22] of worldly goods. But the people are
[1:20:25] less happy than ever. This age boasts of
[1:20:28] spiritual attainments, but the people
[1:20:30] are less sure of themselves than ever.
[1:20:33] This age boasts of better moral values,
[1:20:37] and it is more corrupt than any age
[1:20:39] since the flood. It talks about its
[1:20:41] knowledge and science, but it is
[1:20:43] fighting a losing battle in all fields.
[1:20:46] For the human mind and soul and spirit
[1:20:48] cannot comprehend or keep a breast with
[1:20:51] all the changes that have been coming
[1:20:53] upon the earth. In one generation, we
[1:20:56] have gone all the way from horse and
[1:20:58] buggy uh age to the space age. And we
[1:21:02] are proud and boastful about it. But
[1:21:04] inside is a dark void cavern that is
[1:21:07] crying out in torment. And without a
[1:21:10] known reason, men's hearts are failing
[1:21:13] for fear. And the world is so darkened
[1:21:16] that this age could could well be called
[1:21:18] the age of neurotics. It boasts, but it
[1:21:22] cannot back it up. It cries peace and
[1:21:25] there is no peace. It cries that it has
[1:21:29] uh amplitude of all things, but it keeps
[1:21:33] burning with desire like an unsatisfied
[1:21:35] fire. There is no peace, saith my God,
[1:21:39] to the wicked. Isn't that isn't that
[1:21:41] just that's that's quite an insight.
[1:21:44] Why? Because the word has been totally
[1:21:48] taken away. And you were created to rule
[1:21:50] and reign not by your mind but through
[1:21:54] your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:21:58] That's that that this is a powerful
[1:21:59] reading here tonight. It's very
[1:22:01] powerful. And you young men and young
[1:22:03] women. Oh, we're thankful. You we're
[1:22:06] thankful for education and we and we got
[1:22:08] to have education to even fit in this
[1:22:10] world. But I'm telling you, there's one
[1:22:13] thing that's that'll there's only one
[1:22:16] thing that'll make you satisfied, and
[1:22:17] that's a relationship with the Lord.
[1:22:20] Amen. Amen. Now,
[1:22:24] let's see here. Um,
[1:22:26] let's I'm going we let's let's go on.
[1:22:29] Let's go on down. Um, we'll we'll we'll
[1:22:31] make it to the uh let's go another page.
[1:22:35] Where are we at here? See, we're 8:13.
[1:22:38] We'll start wrapping it up. It says they
[1:22:41] are miserable. That means they are
[1:22:43] objects to be pied. Pied. They scorn
[1:22:46] pity. They're full of pride. They vaunt
[1:22:49] what they have. But what they have will
[1:22:53] not stand the test of time. They have
[1:22:56] built upon quicksand rather than the
[1:22:58] rock of revelation of God's word. Soon
[1:23:01] comes the earthquake. Soon there will
[1:23:03] come the storms of the wrath of God and
[1:23:05] judgment. Then comes sudden destruction.
[1:23:09] In in spite of their carnal preparation,
[1:23:12] they will still be unprepared for what
[1:23:15] comes upon the earth. They are those who
[1:23:18] in spite of it all of all their worldly
[1:23:20] efforts are actually opposing themselves
[1:23:23] and don't know it. Boy, that's the
[1:23:24] truth. Objects of pity are they indeed.
[1:23:28] Pity the poor
[1:23:30] uh people who are in the last day
[1:23:33] ecumenical move. They call this the move
[1:23:36] of God when it is of Satan. Pity those
[1:23:39] who do not know the curse of
[1:23:40] organization. Pity those who have so
[1:23:43] many beautiful churches, such lovely
[1:23:45] person uh personages and such grandly
[1:23:49] trained choirs
[1:23:52] and such such a show of wealth and such
[1:23:56] a sedate and reverent form of worship.
[1:23:59] Pity them. Don't envy them. Back to the
[1:24:02] old store buildings. Back to the dimly
[1:24:05] lit rooms, back to the sellers, back to
[1:24:08] the less of the world and more of God.
[1:24:10] Pity those who make their great claims
[1:24:13] and talk about their gifts. Feel for
[1:24:16] them as objects of pity, for soon they
[1:24:18] will be objects of wrath. They are poor.
[1:24:21] Now, of course, that that means
[1:24:23] spiritually poor. the the the the signs
[1:24:26] of this age as it gets closer, as it
[1:24:29] closes is bigger and better churches
[1:24:31] with more and more people with more and
[1:24:33] more manifestation of what is supposed
[1:24:35] to be demonstrations of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:38] But but uh the filled altars, the gifts
[1:24:41] of the spirit in operation, the
[1:24:42] remarkable attendance is not the answer
[1:24:44] from God. For those who come to the
[1:24:47] altars very seldom stay to go on with
[1:24:50] God after the great campaigns are
[1:24:52] finished. Where are all those that who
[1:24:55] came down to the aisles? They heard a
[1:24:58] man. They listened to an appeal. They
[1:25:00] came into the net, but they were not
[1:25:03] fish. And turtlike, they crawled back
[1:25:07] into their own waters. Then there is all
[1:25:09] the talk about this u
[1:25:13] glossia.
[1:25:15] It's supposed to be the evidence of the
[1:25:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And people
[1:25:19] are thinking that we are in the midst of
[1:25:21] a great revival. The revival is over.
[1:25:24] America's had her chance. 1957.
[1:25:28] Now the the tongues are sign a God sign
[1:25:32] of impending disaster even as it were
[1:25:35] when they appeared upon the wall of
[1:25:36] Belchazzar's feast. Don't you know that
[1:25:39] many are going to come in the last days
[1:25:41] and say, "Lord, Lord, we uh have we not
[1:25:46] done many wonderful works in thy name,
[1:25:49] even to the casting out of devils." and
[1:25:51] he will say, "Depart from me, ye that
[1:25:54] work iniquity. I never knew you."
[1:25:56] Matthew 7:22-23.
[1:26:00] Jesus said, "They were workers of
[1:26:01] iniquity. Yet you get a man that come
[1:26:04] and pray for the sick and get oil and
[1:26:07] blood appearing in the congregation and
[1:26:09] prophecy going forth and all the manner
[1:26:10] of the supernatural and the people will
[1:26:13] gather around him and swear that he is
[1:26:15] of the Lord even though he is actually
[1:26:17] making a money racket of religion and
[1:26:20] living in sin. The only answer they have
[1:26:23] is the absolute unbiblical answer of
[1:26:25] well he gets results so he must be of
[1:26:28] God. how terrible h how actually poor
[1:26:33] this age is in the spirit of God and the
[1:26:36] poor povertystricken ones don't even
[1:26:40] know it
[1:26:42] isn't that a powerful reading
[1:26:45] now does that do away and we'll just
[1:26:47] stop right there and then we'll we'll go
[1:26:51] on
[1:26:53] now
[1:26:55] this is a this this is an incredibly um
[1:26:59] uh
[1:27:00] an incredible indictment
[1:27:03] by the prophet to to to this generation.
[1:27:08] And um and and again
[1:27:12] this is not this is not that the power
[1:27:14] is not there. It's not that the tongues
[1:27:15] is not there. There is no place in the
[1:27:17] scripture uh that where where the nine
[1:27:21] spiritual gifts have even been taken
[1:27:22] away. But when you've got a church that
[1:27:25] is building the Pentecostal church that
[1:27:28] is building their all of their religion
[1:27:30] around the gifts
[1:27:33] and have done away with the word
[1:27:36] brother Brandham is simply telling us
[1:27:39] look at the fruit look at the fruit okay
[1:27:42] if this is a genuine spirit of God then
[1:27:45] holiness and godliness will be flowing
[1:27:48] through that group
[1:27:50] and when it's not flowing through that
[1:27:52] group and any man That's that's for any
[1:27:54] of us. Amen. We can claim to be I can I
[1:27:57] can claim to be a gifted preacher. I can
[1:28:00] claim to be whatever songwriter or what
[1:28:03] whatever I want to put uh put
[1:28:07] my title on me. If it's not producing
[1:28:12] a greater love for God in my life, then
[1:28:15] I am not where I need in my walk with
[1:28:18] God. lukewarmness is satisfied with
[1:28:22] where we are. Lukewarmness is I've got
[1:28:25] enough. And guys, we don't want that's
[1:28:28] that is the spirit that is in this world
[1:28:31] today. And you live in this world and
[1:28:35] that and and that spirit. Amen. Uh you
[1:28:39] you get you know you you just because
[1:28:42] you get mud on your boots doesn't mean
[1:28:43] that you're a pig. Amen. But don't start
[1:28:47] living like a pig. You got to go and
[1:28:49] wash the mud off. And we've got the
[1:28:51] blood of Jesus to cleanse us of the sins
[1:28:54] that we get in our spirits. Cleanse
[1:28:57] ourselves. There should never be a
[1:28:59] satisfaction. Amen. For a human being
[1:29:01] enjoying themselves and living out in
[1:29:03] the pig pin. Never. Amen. And if you're
[1:29:07] a prince and you've got authority,
[1:29:10] you're not going to want to go live as a
[1:29:12] pulper and and and and be defeated in
[1:29:16] inside of a jail cell or a uh be a slave
[1:29:19] somewhere.
[1:29:20] the you are a son of God and God's word
[1:29:25] should be should should be u not that we
[1:29:30] just believe it but it should it should
[1:29:32] be a a a burning desire of ours. Lord
[1:29:37] let your word live in me. Let your word
[1:29:40] live in me. Can you say amen? Now they
[1:29:44] are all pushing the gifts
[1:29:47] and that's the reason I'm sort of not
[1:29:49] into this thing that's going through the
[1:29:51] message right now of this gifts and
[1:29:53] really pushing gifts.
[1:29:56] I'm not I'm not there. I came out of
[1:29:59] that where we promoted gifts. I believe
[1:30:03] in the gifts, right? And I believe that
[1:30:06] if you get yielded and you and you start
[1:30:08] seeking God enough, I I I and and and
[1:30:11] yield yourself to the Lord, well, the
[1:30:13] Lord can speak through any of you. If
[1:30:15] you've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:16] Ghost, God can do it. And I guarantee
[1:30:18] you, if God's doing it, it'll be
[1:30:19] accurate. And it ain't going to be a
[1:30:21] bunch of vague stuff. God, I I believe
[1:30:23] God can do it. Listen, I'm all for the
[1:30:26] gifts as long as it's God doing the
[1:30:28] talking. That's right. I'm all for
[1:30:31] visions as long as it's God-given the
[1:30:33] vision. I believe it's all. But you know
[1:30:35] what? You know what the prophet taught
[1:30:36] us? Amen. Every vision, the Bible taught
[1:30:39] us this. He didn't, Brother Brandham
[1:30:40] didn't come up that by himself. He said,
[1:30:42] "You take everything to the urum
[1:30:44] thumbum." If a man had a prophecy in the
[1:30:47] Bible or a vision or a word from the
[1:30:49] Lord, it had to come before the urum
[1:30:52] thumbum. And that urum thumbum had had
[1:30:55] if it did not light up then then the guy
[1:30:58] lied.
[1:31:01] Amen. And back in the day, back in the
[1:31:03] Old Testament, if there were lying
[1:31:05] prophets, they were to be stoned. Well,
[1:31:07] praise the Lord. Amen. It's about time
[1:31:10] for some stoning going on in the world
[1:31:11] because there's a lot of lying prophets
[1:31:13] out there, right? And the stones are
[1:31:16] coming. Judgment is coming. But for the
[1:31:19] bride of Jesus Christ, we you we we
[1:31:21] don't we you're not to follow. Amen.
[1:31:23] That's what brother Brandham is saying.
[1:31:25] He says he says a man can get up there
[1:31:27] and have a few gifts and and have a few
[1:31:29] signs and everyone will follow the man.
[1:31:32] We're not to follow the man. You're not
[1:31:34] to follow Wendell Martin. No one should
[1:31:36] follow Wendell Martin. We are following
[1:31:39] Jesus the word.
[1:31:42] Now, we've got to respect our leaders.
[1:31:45] You've got to have that respect. The
[1:31:46] scripture says you've got to have
[1:31:47] respect for the five-fold ministry. But
[1:31:49] that five-fold ministry is not above the
[1:31:52] word. None of us are above the word. I
[1:31:55] am subject just as you are subject to
[1:31:59] the same word. There's not a word for
[1:32:00] you and then a word for a gifted man.
[1:32:05] It's the same word. And we all must line
[1:32:09] up with that word. And that goes for
[1:32:11] every child, every mom, every dad, every
[1:32:14] preacher. Amen. I don't care who you
[1:32:16] are. So, so I I have a I I I I sort of I
[1:32:21] I'm not I'm not I'm not into this. Amen.
[1:32:24] Some of this that that's that that's
[1:32:26] really pushing the gifts in the church.
[1:32:28] I I think there's a danger in that. And
[1:32:30] again, I came out of that. And and I I
[1:32:34] want every one of y'all to know I do
[1:32:36] speak in tongues.
[1:32:41] I I was in a service this this last
[1:32:44] the Friday Saturday night and and there
[1:32:47] was a woman a girl had came up and she
[1:32:50] was in her 20s um and she showed me her
[1:32:53] arms. She's a cutter. And she and and
[1:32:57] deep scars all through her arms. And And
[1:33:00] she came up and says, "I I'm just not
[1:33:03] happy with myself. And I'm not and and
[1:33:06] and I I" and I I started praying for her
[1:33:10] and all of a sudden something just came
[1:33:11] over me and I started speaking in
[1:33:13] tongues. Now, I wasn't blabbering it out
[1:33:15] for everyone else to see, but I was
[1:33:16] right there and I was speaking in
[1:33:17] tonesues. and and and there something
[1:33:20] was trans w was was transferred from my
[1:33:23] being into hers and that and that woman
[1:33:26] it just there there came a power I
[1:33:29] through me through me through my hands
[1:33:32] and came through and it done something
[1:33:34] she just she just those that devil just
[1:33:37] started um uh got got all upset. Amen.
[1:33:42] And she prayed through to victory. Now I
[1:33:46] I am fully expecting the next time I see
[1:33:49] that girl to hear of deliverance.
[1:33:53] But I but that you but but to say that
[1:33:57] I'm a gifted man and that that God can't
[1:34:00] God can't work anymore unless you go to
[1:34:02] this one man or that one that that that
[1:34:05] is not what God's wanting. God's looking
[1:34:07] for a bride that is that is fervent
[1:34:11] about this.
[1:34:13] Knowing that God can heal you. Believe
[1:34:16] that. And if God chooses to use someone
[1:34:19] to help you or send somebody your way to
[1:34:20] help you, then we say, "So be it."
[1:34:23] However God wants to do it. And God's
[1:34:25] used men in my life many times. Men that
[1:34:28] don't know anything. And God just used
[1:34:30] them. And they don't even know that
[1:34:32] God's using them. But but they come in
[1:34:33] and speak right to me. They do it,
[1:34:35] right? Come on. It happens all the time
[1:34:37] in church, doesn't it? It does when the
[1:34:40] preacher's up preaching. What is it?
[1:34:42] It's the spirit of discernment
[1:34:43] discerning you. The preacher might not
[1:34:44] know about it, but God knows about it.
[1:34:46] And he is just walking right down your
[1:34:48] line. That is not that that is that
[1:34:51] that's real, folks. That's a real Holy
[1:34:53] Ghost that's talking.
[1:34:57] Amen. So, what I say is, Lord, we want
[1:35:00] this to be a it it but it's not just for
[1:35:03] the preacher. God's using us all. Amen.
[1:35:06] And God and God wants to use us all. And
[1:35:09] the power is in his word. Lord, let me
[1:35:12] come under the headship of that word.
[1:35:14] The word that they've rejected, let me
[1:35:17] come under that headship. Use me, Lord.
[1:35:19] Speak through me, Lord. Amen. Yeah.
[1:35:23] Y'all y'all remember the time the
[1:35:24] brother Brandham uh he he didn't and the
[1:35:27] musicians can come but uh he didn't know
[1:35:31] uh you know Billy Billy Paul had come to
[1:35:35] pick him up and and he
[1:35:37] and he uh and he and he told him he said
[1:35:40] just just go and tell brother Moore I
[1:35:42] believe it was tell him that or brother
[1:35:44] Baxter one of the two and and that I'm
[1:35:46] not coming. I just I just don't feel
[1:35:47] like I'm under the anointing. I just I I
[1:35:50] not going to you guys preach. I'm not
[1:35:52] coming to the service tonight. And then
[1:35:54] he says, he says, and then as he was
[1:35:56] shutting the door, he said he and he
[1:35:58] went back into prayer again and he says,
[1:36:00] and all of a sudden the spirit of the
[1:36:02] Lord come upon him. He said, he was
[1:36:04] speaking in tongues. He said, it sounded
[1:36:05] like German and he was just speaking in
[1:36:08] tongues and just he says, and then all
[1:36:10] then there was that release. And so then
[1:36:12] then then he he ran back and says, "Hey,
[1:36:14] I'm going to come anyways." And and when
[1:36:16] he got to the service that night, y'all
[1:36:19] remember the lady that was that that was
[1:36:21] in trouble and the presence and he was
[1:36:24] interceding for that lady while uh uh
[1:36:29] while she was on her way to church. I
[1:36:30] can't remember the full story, but it
[1:36:32] what it was is there was intercession
[1:36:34] going on from a believer. And if you
[1:36:36] start if if we can become just like
[1:36:39] this, like he was talking about the
[1:36:41] Baptist saying, "God, don't heal no
[1:36:42] more. God don't do this anymore. God,
[1:36:44] don't do that. We just believe the word.
[1:36:47] We just don't believe men's
[1:36:49] interpretation of the word. We believe
[1:36:51] it. Well, praise the Lord. If you take
[1:36:54] away prophecy, then you're going to kick
[1:36:55] out our prophet.
[1:36:58] Amen. But the gift, and I understand
[1:37:01] that his gift was far more than a gift
[1:37:03] of prophecy. He was a word prophet. But
[1:37:05] what I'm saying, the word is a discerner
[1:37:10] of the word. That's the word is
[1:37:13] incredible. And if we have the word
[1:37:14] within us, it'll cleanse and it'll it'll
[1:37:17] give light. Amen. Any anybody have
[1:37:20] anything else they want to say? Amen.
[1:37:22] Add add to what we read.
[1:37:27] Someone outside's wanting to talk. Amen.
[1:37:29] Hallelujah.
[1:37:32] Or is that you? That was you. Amen.
[1:37:38] Um
[1:37:41] all right. So, nothing else to be said.
[1:37:44] Any questions? Amen.
[1:37:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:53] I thought I seen a hand raised.
[1:37:56] Amen.
[1:38:01] All right.
[1:38:03] Well, we're glad to have you, too.
[1:38:11] Yeah.
[1:38:13] Well, God still delivers today. And you
[1:38:17] know, I believe God God loves men and
[1:38:20] women that are that may be bound by by
[1:38:24] alcohol or drugs or any of those things.
[1:38:27] God is still our deliverer. And and the
[1:38:31] thing is I I think the thing is in in in
[1:38:33] our society again as we've read here
[1:38:35] tonight, the deep desire to come to know
[1:38:40] a living God. And I whether it be the
[1:38:43] sinner out there or those that are I
[1:38:46] believe we can we can see the presence
[1:38:47] of God come in and bring that
[1:38:49] deliverance. And he'll do that for any
[1:38:51] man who will truly come and seek him and
[1:38:55] ask the Lord for his grace. God loves
[1:38:58] the God loves mankind.
[1:39:02] God loves every one of you that is in
[1:39:04] this building here tonight. There is no
[1:39:07] sin too great. There is no bondage or
[1:39:11] shackles too tight. But what God cannot
[1:39:14] deliver. Amen. Hallelujah. And we can
[1:39:18] all say amen to that because we have all
[1:39:20] come out of bondages and God has set us
[1:39:23] free. Amen. And do you love the Lord for
[1:39:26] that? I love him with all of my heart.
[1:39:31] Hallelujah.
[1:39:34] Amen.
[1:39:36] His his presence. So if you have no
[1:39:39] word, there's no satisfaction. There's
[1:39:41] no purpose. There's no power. Without
[1:39:44] the word, there is no God.
[1:39:47] Oh, but God's been good to us. Amen. Why
[1:39:51] don't we just sing? It's it's it's it
[1:39:53] it's an old song and I but you'll never
[1:39:55] outlive this. I need thee. Oh, I need
[1:39:57] thee.

[1:41:07] I want you more than I want anything
[1:41:09] else in the world.
[1:41:13] I don't want to just come to church.
[1:41:17] Don't let me just be a church member.
[1:41:22] I want to be your son, your daughter.

[1:41:30] resurrection.

[1:43:26] we want you to be the Lord of our lives.
[1:43:31] We want to open the door of our heart.
[1:43:36] We want you to take control.
[1:43:42] Lord, take sin away from us.
[1:43:47] Make sin extremely sinful in our hearts
[1:43:49] and our conscience.
[1:43:52] If you say certain things are sin, let
[1:43:55] us say, "God, take it out of me."
[1:44:00] If you say that we need to
[1:44:03] be more sincere and
[1:44:07] we need to take away the laxness in our
[1:44:09] lives,
[1:44:11] that father
[1:44:13] give us a real heart, a passion
[1:44:17] for sincerity, a passion
[1:44:21] to be right with your word.
[1:44:25] I ask Lord
[1:44:27] that you would make us like you and take
[1:44:31] everything that's not like you out of
[1:44:33] us. Lord, we repent tonight.
[1:44:36] Oh God, let your spirit move in us and
[1:44:40] burn sin from us.
[1:44:45] Lord, those that may be struggling with
[1:44:49] different things in their lives,
[1:44:52] you know where they are. You live with
[1:44:54] them.
[1:44:57] Whether it be lying or whether it
[1:45:02] Lord be a proud spirit or
[1:45:06] alcoholism or
[1:45:09] drugs or
[1:45:11] even a religious
[1:45:14] spirit.
[1:45:16] Lord, we don't want to be bound by
[1:45:18] anything.
[1:45:20] We don't want to be bound by pride.
[1:45:24] We don't want to be under the shackles
[1:45:26] of anything the devil has to offer.
[1:45:30] Free us, Lord.
[1:45:33] I ask that your presence, Lord, is this
[1:45:36] has not been an emotional service, but
[1:45:39] your word is here.
[1:45:41] And where your word is, the spirit is
[1:45:44] here to give it life.
[1:45:47] that I'm asking, Lord, every heart
[1:45:49] that's reaching out to you in sincerity
[1:45:52] tonight,
[1:45:54] Lord, let the word find its target.
[1:45:58] Cause that seed to live.
[1:46:02] Satan, you're a liar.
[1:46:04] That's what I declare to you tonight.
[1:46:07] You don't have the title deed to any of
[1:46:10] our souls, and you don't have the title
[1:46:11] deed to our bodies.
[1:46:16] We don't have to be bound by you. In
[1:46:20] fact, the word has given me as a servant
[1:46:23] of Christ the authority
[1:46:26] to cast you away from God's people.
[1:46:31] And I am standing with these brothers
[1:46:33] and sisters
[1:46:38] who have lifted their hearts and saying,
[1:46:40] "I want everything that you have, Lord.
[1:46:44] I ask God that you would drive every
[1:46:47] devil that's been guarding their lives.
[1:46:49] And I'm asking that you would give them
[1:46:50] victory.
[1:46:53] Satan, you cannot hold God's people
[1:46:55] anymore.
[1:46:57] For the word has come and we have made a
[1:47:00] conscientious choice, decision
[1:47:04] to walk with Jesus in sincerity and
[1:47:07] truth.
[1:47:10] In the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:47:13] I'm asking God that you would remove,
[1:47:16] drive back every spirit of laxness.
[1:47:20] Oh God,
[1:47:23] let there be a fire burn in every one of
[1:47:25] our hearts.
[1:47:27] Rekindle the flame. Stir up the gift
[1:47:31] that is within us, Lord, is our prayer.
[1:47:35] Lord, we want you to take us and use us
[1:47:38] for whatever purpose you have for us.
[1:47:44] Lord Jesus, let the community know that
[1:47:46] you are alive.
[1:47:49] Use us, Lord.
[1:47:52] We we we
[1:47:54] want to give you our all.

[1:48:23] Hallelujah.
[1:48:25] Hallelujah.

[1:48:43] me now
[1:48:47] my savior.
[1:48:50] [Music]

[1:49:46] the way.
[1:49:49] Hallelujah.
[1:49:52] I bless
[1:49:54] your name.
[1:49:57] Yes, I do.

[1:50:02] your name.
[1:50:06] One more time. I bless your name.
[1:50:16] I bless

[1:50:21] Hallelujah.
[1:50:23] I give you water. Hallelujah.
[1:50:31] I give
[1:50:34] you praise.
[1:50:39] You are the life.
[1:50:45] Yes, you are. You're the truth,
[1:50:49] the way.
[1:50:53] Oh Jesus, I bless
[1:50:57] your name.
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:02] I bless
[1:51:05] your name.
[1:51:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:12] Amen. I love him.
[1:51:17] I love him. I love him. I love him.
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:23] You know, back in Pentecost, if you
[1:51:25] weren't running the aisles or if the if
[1:51:28] there wasn't a certain high, then the
[1:51:30] anointing wasn't there.
[1:51:33] But I have found since I've come into to
[1:51:36] this glorious word,
[1:51:38] but it's not the emotion,
[1:51:41] it's the word and our response to that
[1:51:44] word.
[1:51:46] A faith that is reaching out.
[1:51:49] Because if that be the case, then the
[1:51:51] only time that you could ever feel the
[1:51:52] presence of God is in church.
[1:51:55] But I happen to believe that you can
[1:51:57] feel the presence of God in your prayer
[1:51:58] room. You can you can feel the presence
[1:52:01] of God.
[1:52:03] And many of times
[1:52:05] I'm an emotional guy. So,
[1:52:09] but I the presence that I feel in the
[1:52:12] when I'm when I'm
[1:52:15] wanting to shout,
[1:52:18] it's the same God that I'm entertaining.
[1:52:21] It just
[1:52:24] brings tears to my eyes and gives you
[1:52:27] that settleness.
[1:52:29] However God wants to show up, we just
[1:52:32] entertain him. We want to entertain him.
[1:52:35] Always entertain him.
[1:52:37] So, we try to put these things in a box.
[1:52:38] Oh, we don't believe in the shouting
[1:52:40] anymore. Well, then you've just knocked
[1:52:41] God clean out.
[1:52:43] Well, well, there's no altars. Well, we
[1:52:46] don't believe in altars anymore. When
[1:52:47] you do that, you just you just it it's
[1:52:50] it's it's childish. Just let God do what
[1:52:54] he wants to do.
[1:52:59] Is that right? So when the services are
[1:53:01] maybe not as not as jumping or shouting,
[1:53:04] we can still receive from God right
[1:53:07] here. But it's our attitude in it. It's
[1:53:10] our attitude. If we come and and and
[1:53:12] we're lax, there's the problem is a
[1:53:15] laxed
[1:53:18] a a
[1:53:19] lukewarm attitude towards God's word.
[1:53:22] However you come, Lord, I'm going to
[1:53:26] have a passion to receive from you and
[1:53:29] to love you. Aren't you glad for that? I
[1:53:32] love him so much. Amen. Love you. Love
[1:53:35] every one of you. And uh so we we want
[1:53:41] to continue to pray. I want us to
[1:53:44] they've diagnosed brother uh gave an
[1:53:47] official
[1:53:49] diagnosis on on brother Gadman. that
[1:53:52] he's got Crohn's disease. And and I I
[1:53:56] want us now that we know what the name
[1:53:57] of that devil is, we know we we know
[1:54:00] what we're going to cast out. And and so
[1:54:02] I want us to really be praying for
[1:54:04] brother brother Gadman. He's just been
[1:54:06] sick, guys. This brother David's been
[1:54:08] sick for for the last year. And man,

[1:54:43] wonderful. Keep our sister in our
[1:54:46] prayers. uh it's going to be be a minute
[1:54:48] or two until she's she's back up to full
[1:54:51] potential, but I believe she's going to

[1:55:00] glad the surgery was a success. So check
[1:55:03] on Sister Thelma. uh let her know how
