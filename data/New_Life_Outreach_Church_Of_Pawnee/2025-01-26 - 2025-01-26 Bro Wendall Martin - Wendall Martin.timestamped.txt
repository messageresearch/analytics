[44:55] in your purpose but I how many wants to
[44:58] Amen to to please the Lord in all that
[45:02] he has called you to do amen we want to
[45:05] please the Lord Jesus and uh so let's
[45:08] look here in in Hebrews the 12th chapter
[45:12] the first verse it says wherefore seeing
[45:16] we also are compassed about with so
[45:18] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[45:21] aside every weight and the sin which
[45:24] does so easily beset us and let us run
[45:28] with patience the race that is set
[45:31] before us now if you there's there's
[45:35] there's got to be a goal and there's
[45:37] going to be many distractions many
[45:39] things to keep you from that goal the
[45:42] second verse looking unto Jesus the
[45:46] author and the finisher of our faith who
[45:50] for the joy that was set before him
[45:54] endured the cross despising the shame
[45:58] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[46:00] Throne of god let's go to the Lord in
[46:03] prayer father we want to thank you for
[46:06] the presence that we feel here tonight
[46:09] and we come Lord that we lord can give
[46:12] you honor Lord to give you praise but we
[46:16] also come Lord to this service because
[46:18] we need something from you and Lord
[46:22] we're asking that you would Minister to
[46:25] to our needs Lord from the preacher to
[46:28] to whoever may feel that they would be
[46:29] the least in in the congregation tonight
[46:33] I pray Lord that the Holy Spirit would
[46:36] would just come through these aisles and
[46:40] Lord go from corner to corner Lord front
[46:44] to back minister to your people Lord we
[46:47] want to be washed with your word this
[46:49] evening we thank you for your blessings

[46:55] young men father that been hit hard with
[46:58] this Lord these uh the temperatures and
[47:01] the infections I just pray that you'd be
[47:04] with them Lord in their homes tonight
[47:06] ask that you would be with all of those
[47:09] who can't be here this evening Lord you
[47:11] know what they need and where they are
[47:14] and we'll just give you glory and honor
[47:16] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:19] can the church say amen and amen God
[47:22] bless you you can be
[47:25] seated we um we love the Lord Jesus here
[47:29] tonight amen and so we as we uh go along
[47:34] these lines created to minister H amen
[47:38] we want to be zeroed in on our purpose
[47:42] amen the Apostle Paul was just talking
[47:46] about the the race and running that race
[47:50] and how the how important it is that we
[47:55] stay focused upon on the goal because
[47:58] there's going to be many things in in in
[48:01] this last leg of the journey to get you
[48:06] sidetracked Amen to uh hide your purpose
[48:10] from you but you've got to remember as I
[48:14] as I mentioned this morning we have been
[48:18] predestinated we have been placed here
[48:20] in this generation for a purpose and
[48:24] it's very important that we win the
[48:26] trophy
[48:27] it's important that we run this race
[48:30] amen but not just run the race but that
[48:34] we win the race amen now this is not a
[48:37] marathon amen this is a race with
[48:40] winners and losers there this is a this
[48:43] is a race that amen the scripture says
[48:46] not all that starts out is going to is
[48:48] going to finish the race amen this is a
[48:51] this is a race that is going to be a a a
[48:54] hard ran race it's going to be a fight
[48:57] amen the scripture says there in in 1
[49:00] Corinthians 9:24 it says know ye not
[49:03] that they which run a race run all but
[49:07] one receives the prize so run that you
[49:12] may obtain and every man that striveth
[49:15] for the masteries is temperate in all
[49:17] things now they do it to obtain a
[49:21] corruptible Crown but we an
[49:23] Incorruptible I therefore Soul Run
[49:26] somebody say I so
[49:28] run not as
[49:31] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[49:34] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[49:38] amen and bring it in subjection lest
[49:42] that by any means when I have preached
[49:45] to others I myself should be a Cast Away
[49:49] amen I I I look there at at at
[49:51] Revelations 3 and 19 to our generation
[49:55] to this church age he says as many as I
[49:58] love I rebuke and I chasen therefore be
[50:03] zelous therefore and repent can you say
[50:07] amen amen so so brother bradam would
[50:10] would take this the scripture and he
[50:13] would say be zealous and repent now this
[50:16] false church has Zeal no make no mistake
[50:20] about it her Zeal is literally been uh
[50:24] uh that of the Jews John 2:7 the Zeal of
[50:27] thine house hath eaten me up but it is a
[50:30] wrong Zeal it is for the house of their
[50:33] own building it is for their own Creeds
[50:36] dogmas organizations their own
[50:39] righteousness they have put the word out
[50:42] uh for their own ideas and they have
[50:44] deposed the Holy Ghost and made men into
[50:47] leaders they have put aside uh uh
[50:49] eternal life as a person and make it
[50:52] good works or even the church conform uh
[50:55] Conformity rather than good works but
[50:58] God is calling for another Zeal someone
[51:01] say hallelujah it is the Zeal to cry I'm
[51:06] wrong now who is going to say that he is
[51:10] wrong can you say Amen so brother
[51:12] Brandon would tell us now there he is
[51:15] crying out remember amen there's a
[51:17] two-fold purpose for the messenger to
[51:19] our age that Messenger to our age is to
[51:23] Amen to condemn Egypt to condemn those
[51:27] uh uh uh Janis jambers is as it will but
[51:31] it is also to take you out of that land
[51:35] of bondage amen take you through the
[51:38] Wilderness and to bring you into a land
[51:42] amen of your own of God's choosing for
[51:45] you well glory to God Amen aren't you
[51:48] glad that God didn't just tell you amen
[51:50] I'm going to shed my blood and and and
[51:53] so that you can sing songs while you're
[51:55] in the jail cell of sin while you're in
[51:57] the while while you're in the muck and
[51:59] the M while you are all but God's Divine
[52:02] Grace has provided blood for you and I
[52:05] Amen to separate us from Egypt and say
[52:08] you are not part of them I'm taking you
[52:11] into a Promised Land it'll be your
[52:14] promise it'll be your call you can build
[52:18] houses there and the task Masters I'm
[52:20] going to kill every one of
[52:23] them well that should make you want to
[52:25] shout can you say
[52:28] Amen now amen now we we
[52:32] understand excuse me we understand that
[52:35] not everyone that came out of Egypt
[52:39] through the blood of the Lamb made it
[52:41] into the Promise Land amen there we
[52:44] found out that when they came out of
[52:46] Egypt amen the scripture says that uh uh
[52:49] that there was a 40-year Wilderness
[52:51] experience and amen that 40-year
[52:53] Wilderness experience it brought out a
[52:56] lot of things in their lives amen there
[52:58] was coming out of Egypt was one thing
[53:01] but God was wanting to get Egypt out of
[53:04] the people amen and there's where
[53:07] sanctification comes in amen many of
[53:09] times we're sitting on the pews and and
[53:11] we're thanking God for what he has amen
[53:14] for what he's done and amen and this is
[53:16] where Le osia is as a whole amen we got
[53:19] so many claiming to be Christians and
[53:21] claiming to be Sons and Daughters of God
[53:23] we've got mega churches everywhere it
[53:26] seemed like here in Oklahoma we've got
[53:28] amen I I I believe in Tulsa alone
[53:30] there's five mega churches Pentecostal
[53:32] mega churches that amen they you know
[53:34] they run anywhere from 15 to 25,000
[53:37] people amen so so these guys are
[53:39] claiming to be Christians amen but
[53:41] remember God's not wanting to just shed
[53:44] his blood so that you can come to church
[53:47] he's not wanting to just shed his blood
[53:49] just so that you can uh a sing and a
[53:51] choir or amen just so that you can but
[53:54] he has brought you the reality of who
[53:59] you are amen now remember amen Satan
[54:02] wants to say that you're not you're not
[54:04] anything Satan wants you to look at
[54:07] yourself Satan wants you to look amen
[54:09] and say this is the only thing that
[54:11] you'll ever become amen you know you're
[54:13] just got to be satisfied with just the
[54:16] status quo but let me remind you Samson
[54:19] that you don't belong Amen in the in the
[54:22] chains of the Philistines you don't
[54:24] belong there amen grinding at the meal
[54:28] the Son and Daughter of God has been
[54:31] created with a purpose and that is to
[54:33] destroy the works of the devil Satan
[54:36] wants to keep you bound he wants to keep
[54:38] you defeated he wants to keep you under
[54:41] his his control so that you don't
[54:45] control him so that you well praise the
[54:48] Lord somebody amen you've got a purpose
[54:52] and that is that God's grace could flow
[54:55] in and through
[54:57] you
[54:59] Hallelujah now but the children of
[55:01] Israel had a hard time with it they
[55:04] couldn't
[55:06] recognize now here they were coming out
[55:09] of
[55:12] Egypt and they couldn't realize that the
[55:14] land that they were going to was going
[55:16] to be a
[55:19] land that was their very own
[55:22] land that there would never be a amen
[55:25] anything that can kick them out of their
[55:27] land because God had predestinated them
[55:32] for that inheritance well praise the
[55:34] Lord but instead amen through their
[55:37] trials and their weaknesses amen what
[55:39] were they W to do they were wanting to
[55:41] go back into Egypt they were saying oh
[55:43] we're we're going to die out here oh
[55:45] amen we wish to God that we would estate
[55:47] wish to God we would have the garlics
[55:49] and and the leaks and and the things
[55:51] there but you see there was some people
[55:54] that had the desire to go all the way
[55:57] somebody say all the way you know
[55:59] there's a song we used to sing amen back
[56:01] in Pentecost all the way I'm going all
[56:06] the way don't even try to turn me around
[56:11] amen all the way well can you say Amen
[56:14] you say but brother when I I just don't
[56:17] know if I can make it you're
[56:18] predestinated to go all the way now what
[56:21] I said this morning and what I I I
[56:23] brought out amen that that that bride
[56:26] that that girl that amen looked like she
[56:29] was so uh uh you know all the other

[56:37] seemed to be so despondent amen she she

[56:47] the prince came and the prince
[56:50] identified something with her it changed
[56:54] who she was
[56:57] right can you say
[56:58] amen amen you see we can come out of
[57:01] Egypt but getting Egypt out of us is
[57:04] what God is looking for amen what can
[57:06] you say amen God sends the trials God
[57:11] sends the
[57:12] circumstances God sends the situations
[57:16] your way it ain't the devil that's
[57:18] bringing it your way it is God who
[57:21] created the devil it is God who has
[57:24] allowed those things to come your way to
[57:26] challenge your
[57:31] faith

[1:03:20] gun Hallelujah he always accused me of
[1:03:23] not keeping my gun clean so he would say
[1:03:25] clean your gun so he called me up and he
[1:03:28] says now we're fixing to go have you
[1:03:29] cleaned your gun I said oh man I've
[1:03:32] cleaned it up amen and and uh so we get
[1:03:35] out there you know and and everyone else
[1:03:37] they're out there shooting their their
[1:03:39] rifles and and getting everything ready
[1:03:41] someone asked me are you going to shoot
[1:03:42] your rifle I said man Matt McLaren built
[1:03:45] my gun a man and I tried it before I
[1:03:48] left Oklahoma and I'm going to tell you
[1:03:50] right now I'm going to kill me an elk
[1:03:52] praise the Lord but I didn't take in
[1:03:54] consideration that there was the out
[1:03:55] itude I didn't take into consideration
[1:03:58] that there was a lot of these other
[1:03:59] things so they're out there tuning their
[1:04:02] gun in amen and and and and who was the
[1:04:05] first one to see that big old stag amen
[1:04:09] and and here was it was me and Jason
[1:04:11] Green amen we get up on this thing was
[1:04:14] about a 600 yard shot and and I I get
[1:04:17] down on the ground and I'm I'm aiming
[1:04:19] and I shoot and I miss my elk amen I
[1:04:23] totally miss it you see I I I thought I
[1:04:27] had it together I thought that I I had
[1:04:31] the best weapon around it was made by
[1:04:34] the best gunsmith around but you see the
[1:04:37] checklist I did not make sure that I was
[1:04:41] sure that I was well praise the Lord
[1:04:45] Satan is like a roaring lion and youve
[1:04:49] got to be prepared to destroy that enemy
[1:04:55] can you say amen amen if it's too hot it
[1:04:59] it'll affect the accuracy amen you've
[1:05:02] got to shreet your surroundings your
[1:05:04] amen your gun will act differently in
[1:05:06] the mountains as I found out amen we
[1:05:09] find that these kinds of things and I
[1:05:11] want to say the scripture says not to
[1:05:14] just lay aside the sins but he says lay
[1:05:17] aside the weights and the sin which does
[1:05:20] so easily beset you how many things have
[1:05:23] we allowed in our lives amen that we
[1:05:26] allow in our in our in our everyday walk
[1:05:29] maybe maybe it's in the music or maybe
[1:05:31] it's in the friends or or maybe amen
[1:05:34] it's the way uh just just our average
[1:05:36] life without prayer without dedication
[1:05:39] amen and when the time comes that we
[1:05:41] need the glory of the Lord in our church
[1:05:44] in our family and our homes and and
[1:05:46] these kinds of things here we find
[1:05:48] ourselves not in that position where we
[1:05:51] we need to be well can you say Amen but
[1:05:53] I want to say tonight if God has called
[1:05:56] you to be serpent bruisers then we need
[1:05:59] to act like serpent bruisers we need to
[1:06:01] be prepared to defeat the Devil and
[1:06:03] that's in every situation amen of Our
[1:06:06] Lives we must remain ready now Song of
[1:06:10] Solomon 2 and5 it says it says take or
[1:06:13] catch us the
[1:06:15] foxes it's the little foxes that spoil
[1:06:18] the vine for our Vines have tender
[1:06:21] grapes amen so what is he saying it's
[1:06:24] the little things that we justify in our
[1:06:28] lives that are that are the things that
[1:06:31] sap us of our
[1:06:35] strength I've got a a dump
[1:06:38] truck that can't seem to stay
[1:06:44] charged and um amen I go and put the put
[1:06:48] a new battery in it and then something
[1:06:49] is
[1:06:51] sapping the the juice out of that thing
[1:06:55] and going around and around well I found
[1:06:57] out that it was the
[1:06:59] break amen the break does not totally
[1:07:03] decompressed so when I push it down and
[1:07:05] I let back out there was a little
[1:07:07] portion of that and it that that that
[1:07:09] stays on and it keeps the lights on in
[1:07:10] the back Hallelujah and every time that
[1:07:14] I jump into that wonderful thing amen
[1:07:18] it's always dead and I I I have changed
[1:07:22] the battery I've and I have I have
[1:07:24] charged that thing I for the last last
[1:07:27] time I don't want to charge that sorry
[1:07:30] truck again amen but you see I I could
[1:07:34] cuss it amen preacher cussing amen you
[1:07:37] sorry thing you and and you can you can
[1:07:40] kick the tires you can say all of those
[1:07:43] things but until I am ready to get into
[1:07:47] the nitty-gritty find out what is
[1:07:50] sapping the life out of that battery
[1:07:53] that that truck is not going to run
[1:07:56] right that truck is not going well can
[1:07:59] you say Amen that truck is ordained it
[1:08:02] was built to carry load it was built to
[1:08:05] haul Rock and dirt it was built for the
[1:08:09] construction site but that truck does me
[1:08:11] no good as long as that battery keeps
[1:08:14] dying every time I get out of it can you
[1:08:17] say Amen so what do I have to do I have
[1:08:20] to go in and find out amen what is
[1:08:22] killing my lifeline what what what is
[1:08:25] causing that to drain out and I want to
[1:08:27] tell you there's a lot in Leota to take
[1:08:30] away the strength and the power of life
[1:08:34] out of the Christian it's not God's
[1:08:36] fault God's designed you God's built you
[1:08:40] God's anointed you to defeat the enemy
[1:08:44] amen but there are things in our lives
[1:08:46] that Satan wants to bring in and to
[1:08:49] ground his power within you well someone
[1:08:53] shout hallelujah
[1:08:56] amen now those little things brother
[1:09:00] Brandon would
[1:09:01] say amen he would say it's the word of
[1:09:04] the Living God it's so
[1:09:06] essential amen until all the heavens and
[1:09:09] earth will pass away and yet but it
[1:09:11] shall never pass away God knows his
[1:09:13] every word that little word that we read
[1:09:16] God knows all every little thought that
[1:09:19] goes through our mind every little act
[1:09:21] that we do I'm kindly thinking of this
[1:09:24] many times the church in its looseness
[1:09:27] gets to doing things and and and and
[1:09:30] thinking things and taking things as
[1:09:32] they are when we ought to weigh what we
[1:09:35] do and say and we ought to think it over
[1:09:39] before we speak it my old southern Mama
[1:09:42] used to tell me think twice and speak
[1:09:44] once it's the little things sometimes
[1:09:47] that we leave undone that means so much
[1:09:49] to us we get in such a hurry to race
[1:09:53] over things in this neurotic age that
[1:09:54] we're living in and it would behoove us
[1:09:57] as the Church of God tonight to stop and
[1:10:00] wait a minute and see where we're at can
[1:10:03] you say amen amen the Apostle Paul would
[1:10:06] say in Philippians 3 and7 what things
[1:10:09] were gained to me those things I count
[1:10:12] loss for Christ what things were gained
[1:10:16] to me those things I count loss amen
[1:10:19] what was he doing he was sharing uh he
[1:10:21] was sharing his strategy because the
[1:10:24] enemy was is going to fight them now you
[1:10:27] might be a new Christian sitting here
[1:10:28] tonight maybe you're an old Christian
[1:10:31] that is sitting here tonight but the
[1:10:33] strategies that the word of God has
[1:10:35] given us amen is there for us to live
[1:10:39] not just an average Christian life but
[1:10:43] an
[1:10:44] overcoming Christian
[1:10:48] Life how many want your marriage to be
[1:10:51] successful how many want your children
[1:10:53] to be successful how many wants your
[1:10:56] walk with God to be successful we want
[1:11:00] success and the way we get success is by
[1:11:04] God's grace within us through his
[1:11:08] word
[1:11:10] now as I as I think along these lines
[1:11:13] and amen as I have laid this this out
[1:11:18] before you
[1:11:19] tonight amen I I think of this scripture
[1:11:22] there in Philippians 3 and12
[1:11:26] not as though I had already
[1:11:29] attained either were already
[1:11:33] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[1:11:38] apprehend that word apprehend means
[1:11:41] arrest if I may arrest or take for
[1:11:44] myself that for which I am apprehended
[1:11:49] or arrested of Christ Jesus Brethren I
[1:11:52] count not myself to have already already
[1:11:56] apprehended but this one thing I
[1:12:00] do someone shout
[1:12:03] hallelujah forgetting those things which
[1:12:06] are behind
[1:12:09] me and reaching forth under those things
[1:12:12] which are
[1:12:14] before I
[1:12:17] press I press that means you can't ever
[1:12:21] get you Hallelujah Christianity is not
[1:12:24] going to be amen just coasting
[1:12:26] Christianity is not a vacation in the
[1:12:29] Bahamas amen Christianity is going to be
[1:12:32] a press enemy is going to fight you hard
[1:12:37] amen he's
[1:12:39] Hallelujah if if you don't run out of
[1:12:42] gas he'll get the the dog to bite the
[1:12:44] mailman and he'll get this and he'll get
[1:12:46] that anything to keep you or distract
[1:12:50] you from your purpose but as I am am I
[1:12:54] as I am trying to build to you here
[1:12:57] today we got to keep the goal in front
[1:13:02] of us the goal is a bride without spot
[1:13:06] the goal is a Rapture the goal is
[1:13:10] leaving this whole world behind and pre
[1:13:14] we're preparing for that can you say
[1:13:17] Amen it says I press toward the mark for
[1:13:20] the prize of the high calling in Christ
[1:13:22] I like the Young's literal translation
[1:13:24] of that it says not that I had did
[1:13:27] already obtain or have already been
[1:13:29] perfected but I pursue if also I may lay
[1:13:33] hold on that for which also I uh I was
[1:13:38] laid a hold of by Christ Jesus Brethren
[1:13:41] I do not reckon myself to have laid hold
[1:13:43] and one thing the things which behind
[1:13:46] indeed forgetting and to the things
[1:13:48] which before uh stretching forth to the
[1:13:52] Mark I pursue or chase for the pr of the
[1:13:55] High Calling of God in Christ
[1:13:59] Jesus as I begin to
[1:14:03] think as Israel was sitting there before
[1:14:05] the
[1:14:06] promise after God had brought them out
[1:14:08] of the promised land and God had shown
[1:14:10] himself
[1:14:12] real and God was wanting to make himself
[1:14:15] known very personal to them because they
[1:14:18] were fixing they were fixing to enter
[1:14:21] into that promised land and God was
[1:14:24] going
[1:14:25] to show them that
[1:14:29] every place their feet touched was
[1:14:34] theirs God was fixing to show them that
[1:14:38] no matter what the obstacle was no
[1:14:43] matter what the situation was God was
[1:14:47] going to bring them
[1:14:49] through but they were sitting there at
[1:14:52] cadis Baria which represent amen the
[1:14:55] line between doubt and
[1:14:58] Faith it was there at this place it was
[1:15:01] the Judgment Center amen of that of that
[1:15:05] of that area that's where it was the
[1:15:07] great metropolitan
[1:15:10] area and they were going to have to make
[1:15:13] their decision there was the day the
[1:15:15] time of judgment they were either going
[1:15:16] to judge God Faithful his word faithful
[1:15:20] or they were going to stay in the
[1:15:22] wilderness
[1:15:26] they were going to they had to bring up
[1:15:28] all of everything yes in the wilderness
[1:15:30] they had seen a lot of they had seen a
[1:15:32] lot of
[1:15:33] stuff they had seen the chorus and the
[1:15:35] daans they had seen the serpents biting
[1:15:38] and killing they had seen a lot of
[1:15:40] things that's going through but God had
[1:15:41] been
[1:15:43] faithful and the pillar of fire had led
[1:15:45] them and they are fixing to cross over
[1:15:48] into their promised land where they
[1:15:50] could build their house they were no
[1:15:53] longer going to be slaves they were no
[1:15:56] longer going to have to answer to
[1:15:58] anybody else it was going to be
[1:16:02] theirs but the only way this was going
[1:16:04] to happen is for them to believe the
[1:16:08] words of the Lord are you hearing me now
[1:16:12] I I I I'm talking to you because the
[1:16:14] reason why the devil or God allows the
[1:16:17] devil to bring things our way is to test
[1:16:20] your
[1:16:21] faith well how many believes you've been
[1:16:23] tested a lot lately
[1:16:27] amen there's a we we've been tested here
[1:16:29] and there we just just been every which
[1:16:31] direction brother John is still
[1:16:32] struggling so hard with his head we've
[1:16:34] got so many that are that are just
[1:16:36] struggling they're struggling and you
[1:16:38] can either look at these things and say
[1:16:39] well God hasn't God's not hearing our
[1:16:41] prayer or you can look at these things
[1:16:43] and saying God has allowed these things
[1:16:45] to test us and to see where we are to
[1:16:49] see where are we going to believe him
[1:16:51] are we we are here at the Cades Barne
[1:16:54] Maybe in your
[1:16:57] situation glory to God that land is
[1:17:01] yours healing is yours victory is yours
[1:17:06] but God is looking for men and women
[1:17:09] that'll stand to his word and believe
[1:17:12] what he
[1:17:17] says can you say
[1:17:20] Amen
[1:17:22] now we found that when the preachers
[1:17:25] come back and there was 10 of them that
[1:17:27] came back said man we can't do it there
[1:17:28] are giants in that land there's all
[1:17:31] kinds of devils over there I don't want
[1:17:34] to go we we're going to get
[1:17:36] slaughtered Hallelujah but Jake but
[1:17:38] there was a Caleb and a Joshua who came
[1:17:40] back and
[1:17:42] said yeah there's Giants but look at all
[1:17:45] of the
[1:17:46] promises here's the grapes where where I
[1:17:49] mean where where that takes two of us to
[1:17:52] bring the grapes back over the milk and
[1:17:55] honey that God said was in that land is
[1:17:58] there they went back and started
[1:18:01] confirming what God had already said God
[1:18:05] had already promised them oh can you say
[1:18:09] amen amen they came back Hallelujah he
[1:18:13] said we're more than able we're more
[1:18:16] than
[1:18:17] able here when God was when God
[1:18:21] was talking about Caleb I I like this
[1:18:24] right here in numbers 14 and 23 it says
[1:18:27] but my servant
[1:18:28] Caleb because he had another spirit with
[1:18:31] him and hath followed me
[1:18:35] fully
[1:18:36] him will I bring into the land whether
[1:18:40] he
[1:18:41] went and his seed
[1:18:45] shall possess
[1:18:50] it desire
[1:18:55] I know I I know that LE oia is all
[1:18:59] around us there's there we we we we are
[1:19:02] there's there's so many things to
[1:19:05] distract but if this Rapture is upon us
[1:19:08] and how many believes the Rapture is
[1:19:10] upon
[1:19:11] us if the coming of the Lord is so
[1:19:14] soon there should be something within

[1:24:15] had this son and and and and and the
[1:24:19] Bible says that amen uh her husband
[1:24:23] brought the boy in about noon and the
[1:24:25] baby died and and and and and and here

[1:24:41] here he would come in and amen and sleep
[1:24:43] and she would take care of him and and

[1:25:21] wasn't she wasn't selfish in her way of
[1:25:25] thinking she she had a promise from God
[1:25:29] and she knew that God could not lie and
[1:25:33] when the test was on in her life and

[1:31:05] there's nothing you can do sitting in
[1:31:07] this church that can make if you
[1:31:09] couldn't mess it up when you were in sin
[1:31:10] then you can't mess it up
[1:31:15] here but God sends you through your
[1:31:18] Wilderness

[1:31:29] wearing the cloak of a Believer amen

[1:31:42] congregation that says I must I will
[1:31:46] come on church I don't care amen if it's
[1:31:49] in the Lion's Den or if it's in the

[1:31:56] they've went through the rigid training
[1:31:59] they've gone through the trial and God
[1:32:01] has brought them out they didn't always
[1:32:04] look like a Christian they didn't always
[1:32:06] act like a Christian but they believe
[1:32:09] that God would bring them out and they

[1:33:10] out and the woman of sha
[1:33:13] shuna she

[1:34:52] and and and my dad can play anything but
[1:34:54] he's got one he but he he he's centered
[1:34:58] on the
[1:34:59] guitar now dad can play anything he
[1:35:01] wants to amen me I didn't Center on
[1:35:05] anything and so now I just like I'm not
[1:35:08] good at anything I I can just fill in
[1:35:10] wherever and and you've got and if
[1:35:13] you're going to get good at something
[1:35:15] you set the goal and say this is where
[1:35:20] my love

[1:35:24] I feel like I'm just preaching a flop
[1:35:25] here tonight but I but I'm telling you
[1:35:27] right now where's the goal you can't
[1:35:31] have your cake and eat it
[1:35:34] too what do you
[1:35:38] want what do we want if we
[1:35:42] want more of God then we can't have more
[1:35:45] of friends and this and that and this
[1:35:47] and that and this and that and still
[1:35:49] maintain a walk with
[1:35:52] God if if we're wanting to overcome
[1:35:55] we've got to Center our zero wi and say
[1:36:00] I I want more of you more than I want
[1:36:03] breath I want more of you more than I
[1:36:05] want wealth I want more of you than I
[1:36:08] want anything well can you say amen amen
[1:36:11] what we want what is it because there is
[1:36:14] we want all of the distractions away so
[1:36:18] that we can rise in the power of His
[1:36:22] might brother Brenham would put it this
[1:36:24] way he would say be
[1:36:26] simple just ask don't figure it out
[1:36:31] don't try to study it just believe it
[1:36:35] don't mentally figure it out just
[1:36:37] believe it with your soul the first
[1:36:40] conflict that ever come into the world
[1:36:41] was because somebody was seeking worldly
[1:36:43] wisdom instead of a simple faith in God
[1:36:47] listen to this you you say Dr so and so
[1:36:50] doesn't believe it that that doesn't
[1:36:52] change God's word word a bit remember
[1:36:54] you're not saved by wisdom you are not
[1:36:56] saved by your education you are saved by
[1:37:00] faith in Jesus
[1:37:02] Christ forget about your education and
[1:37:05] be
[1:37:06] simple in your own
[1:37:09] Doctrine
[1:37:11] Amen in the church age book and I'm
[1:37:14] closing but brother Brenham would say in
[1:37:16] the church age book in the sardian uh
[1:37:19] age he says in short christiandom has
[1:37:21] become a labyrinth
[1:37:24] the faith has been split into a thousand
[1:37:26] little
[1:37:27] parts and and how many knows what a
[1:37:30] labyrinth is it's it's it's
[1:37:33] a it's a maze
[1:37:36] it's it's got the little um uh how
[1:37:40] many's ever been in a maze or a corn
[1:37:42] corn maze or in those kinds of things
[1:37:44] and you know you've got one way in and
[1:37:46] one way out but then once you get in
[1:37:49] there Hallelujah I don't like them
[1:37:54] it just gets me confused I'm going I'm
[1:37:56] trying to think it
[1:38:00] out and and the prophet would tell us
[1:38:03] that Christendom has become that until
[1:38:06] it's so many different
[1:38:08] ways and he saying you've got to come
[1:38:11] back because the Salvation is not
[1:38:16] multiple it's a faith in Jesus Christ
[1:38:20] and Jesus Christ Alone
[1:38:24] can you say Amen be simple there are not
[1:38:29] many approaches to
[1:38:30] Salvation there's only one approach to
[1:38:34] Salvation there's only one way and it's
[1:38:37] Jesus Christ
[1:38:43] alone it's the the finished work of
[1:38:48] Calvary and if you fail to
[1:38:52] believe that Christ paid the price for
[1:38:56] you you're
[1:39:01] lost there's only one formula for being
[1:39:03] baptized or or for being born
[1:39:06] again Hallelujah blood water and
[1:39:13] spirit there's only one way to be
[1:39:18] baptized
[1:39:20] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:39:23] and the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:39:24] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:39:27] the gift of the Holy
[1:39:29] Ghost there's only one way to be a
[1:39:32] disciple of Jesus
[1:39:34] Christ Jesus says if you're not
[1:39:38] willing to forsake your life and pick up
[1:39:43] your cross and follow me you're not
[1:39:45] worthy to be my
[1:39:49] disciple
[1:39:51] amen see it's it's it's a it's a it's
[1:39:56] not many it's not just anything it's
[1:39:59] pretty simple we simply follow the ways
[1:40:04] that God's laid out for you and
[1:40:06] me well praise the Lord for a simple guy
[1:40:09] like me that that makes me feel pretty
[1:40:12] good you see it's not it is simply
[1:40:16] taking God at his word and saying Lord
[1:40:20] I'm going to see my victory
[1:40:23] I'm going to see my victory I'm going to
[1:40:27] attend to my Lord without remember what
[1:40:29] was my title this morning amen my title
[1:40:32] this morning I was created to serve him
[1:40:37] I was created remember amen Adam and Eve
[1:40:40] and though Eve had fallen short though
[1:40:43] Eve had failed Adam wasn't going to stay
[1:40:46] in Paradise alone Adam came down Adam
[1:40:49] took on the sin of his wife amen Adam
[1:40:52] couldn't do anything about redeeming her
[1:40:55] but our Adam was able to redeem us and
[1:40:58] our Adam was saying listen I want you
[1:41:02] get that mentality that you're not an
[1:41:05] overcomer you've got to get the
[1:41:07] mentality that you came from me you are
[1:41:12] who I am you are the feminine portion of
[1:41:16] God can you say Amen there's only one
[1:41:19] way for the perfecting of the
[1:41:21] church amen that's through the preaching
[1:41:23] of the Gospel 1 Corinthians 1:18 for the
[1:41:27] preaching of the Cross is to them that
[1:41:28] perish foolishness but unto us which are
[1:41:30] saved it is the power of God 1
[1:41:32] Corinthians 1:21 for after that in the
[1:41:35] wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew
[1:41:37] not God it pleased God by the
[1:41:40] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:41:41] that are
[1:41:42] lost there's only one requirement for
[1:41:46] healing faith in the finished work of
[1:41:49] Calvary there's too many distractions
[1:41:52] too many voices of reason too many
[1:41:54] doctor's opinions too many things but
[1:41:56] what did the scripture say casting down
[1:41:59] every thought every imagination every
[1:42:02] High thing that exalts itself above the
[1:42:05] knowledge of
[1:42:07] God
[1:42:10] Amen I listen I just I heard brother
[1:42:13] brandom as he was the anointing was
[1:42:15] there and and and and then he stops and
[1:42:18] he says Mister you sitting in the
[1:42:20] wheelchair you on the cot you you here
[1:42:23] or back Yonder where wherever you are if
[1:42:25] you're born of the spirit of God you got
[1:42:28] just as much right to rise from that
[1:42:30] chair and wheel cart tonight as any
[1:42:33] other man has you're born again get a
[1:42:36] little grit about you stand up and Jesus
[1:42:39] Christ standing here in his word proving
[1:42:41] what he is showing signs wonders
[1:42:43] miracles of his resurrection what more
[1:42:46] do we
[1:42:51] want well if God just someday I you're
[1:42:54] missing the point God's not someday you
[1:42:57] are the one that God's given the land
[1:43:00] to his anointing is upon you zero in get
[1:43:07] that sword and say Satan I'm anointed
[1:43:10] for
[1:43:11] this I'm anointed for
[1:43:14] this I don't have to knuckle down I
[1:43:17] don't have to quit I don't have to turn
[1:43:19] around I don't have to cry I'm anoy for
[1:43:29] this they say that India has got some of
[1:43:32] the
[1:43:34] richest resources under their
[1:43:37] grounds but because of their
[1:43:40] religion and because they're afraid of
[1:43:43] killing a natat or a ant or killing
[1:43:47] because they believe in
[1:43:51] reincarnation americ is getting close to
[1:43:54] being that way and they
[1:43:58] Gods but they won't let them they don't
[1:44:01] they won't drill they they they they
[1:44:03] they just there's so much things that
[1:44:05] they they have so many resources in the
[1:44:09] land of
[1:44:11] India they're
[1:44:15] wealthy they're
[1:44:18] wealthy and yet the majority are
[1:44:21] poor they they've got the
[1:44:26] resources but they don't have the
[1:44:30] knowledge to put it to
[1:44:34] work well praise the
[1:44:37] Lord I I do do you all believe do do you
[1:44:41] do do we really believe that that this
[1:44:44] is the power of
[1:44:45] God we've got the
[1:44:48] resources and I'm just happening to
[1:44:51] believe that God sent us a amen a
[1:44:54] seventh angel messenger he sent us our
[1:44:57] own spiritual Einstein and says listen
[1:45:00] you can put this thing to
[1:45:02] work you can be everything that God has
[1:45:04] said in his word can you say amen amen
[1:45:08] if the musicians would
[1:45:12] come praise the
[1:45:15] Lord I think too many times y'all heard
[1:45:17] the
[1:45:19] story of the Old Crow how many remembers
[1:45:22] the story of the
[1:45:24] crow amen farmer got tired of the crows
[1:45:28] coming in and eating his
[1:45:30] corn and eating his his crops so he
[1:45:33] finally caught one of those old crows as
[1:45:35] they come in
[1:45:36] and and um tied a
[1:45:40] little tied a little string around his
[1:45:43] his foot and gave him about 30 40 feet
[1:45:47] to play with and put him right down
[1:45:49] there and every time the crows would try
[1:45:51] to come he would take off try to follow
[1:45:53] him and amen and and um all all the
[1:45:57] action it would it would it would um
[1:45:59] scare the others
[1:46:01] away and so he had his own real
[1:46:05] scarecrow and so finally I a fell came
[1:46:09] by and you know sing sing this poor Crow
[1:46:12] out there and he had he had wore a he
[1:46:14] had wore a circle clean around that that
[1:46:17] that little peg in the ground where he
[1:46:20] he'd get out as far as he could go and
[1:46:22] he just got got pretty well
[1:46:27] accustomed being stuck there and the
[1:46:30] nice fella came over there caught the
[1:46:34] crow got his pocket knife out and cut
[1:46:37] the
[1:46:38] rope and
[1:46:41] uh but the crow didn't fly off the crow
[1:46:45] didn't fly off at all the crow
[1:46:49] day and the guy just you know sort of so
[1:46:53] well do what you want to
[1:46:57] do so the next time the crows came by
[1:47:01] next season as they were all beginning
[1:47:03] to fly over did you know what happened
[1:47:05] they say that the crow flew up as far as
[1:47:09] he could get what he was used to and he
[1:47:12] stopped right there where he had
[1:47:15] stopped all of those other times
[1:47:20] before he did not have have a rope on
[1:47:25] his foot anymore he did not have a
[1:47:28] string there was no bondage there was
[1:47:30] nothing
[1:47:31] there but he was imprisoned in his
[1:47:36] mind imprisoned in his
[1:47:39] mind therefore he would just go around
[1:47:43] the same old rut that he's went around
[1:47:45] all of this other time
[1:47:54] Bo it sounds like a bunch of
[1:47:59] Christians just go through the same old
[1:48:02] cycle God's not called you to go through
[1:48:05] cycle God's called you to
[1:48:08] fly
[1:48:10] Hallelujah fly high fly
[1:48:14] strong let the power and the presence of
[1:48:16] God lift you up in the spirit of prayer

[1:50:35] Heavens
[1:50:42] amen praise the
[1:50:46] Lord I
[1:50:49] think the greatest thing that Satan can
[1:50:51] ever do is keep us us down in
[1:50:54] condemnation and when we've been
[1:50:56] pressing towards our goal can can you
[1:50:58] imagine the
[1:51:02] condemnation that Samson must have felt
[1:51:05] could you imagine the
[1:51:07] condemnation that the man of Corinth y'
[1:51:10] y'all remember the man of Corinth who's
[1:51:11] who who took his
[1:51:14] father's wife to be his wife and laid
[1:51:18] with her y'all remember that and and and
[1:51:20] the Apostle Paul says listen cast him
[1:51:24] out for the destruction of the flesh
[1:51:26] that his soul can be saved I mean you
[1:51:29] remember
[1:51:32] that you you you you you remember when
[1:51:34] Peter made a big flub of himself and the
[1:51:37] and the Apostle Paul told told the
[1:51:40] church he said I had to withstand him to
[1:51:42] his face because he was causing
[1:51:45] divisions
[1:51:54] recovery is a great thing for it but did
[1:51:57] you know that in any
[1:51:59] mission of the
[1:52:01] military or
[1:52:04] anything they plan for
[1:52:10] Recovery I like to fly but I I I and I
[1:52:14] when I'm on that jet airplane I don't
[1:52:15] like those stewardess is coming up there

[1:52:21] put your seat back belts on in the case
[1:52:24] of an
[1:52:25] emergency there'll be something popped
[1:52:27] down we if you lose oxygen you got to
[1:52:30] put this mask
[1:52:33] on you know and then for those of you
[1:52:37] that are on an exit roll I want you you
[1:52:39] look at this exit that exit then the in
[1:52:41] the if you have to jump out
[1:52:46] you and I'm sitting there thinking
[1:52:53] but
[1:52:55] recovery is part of
[1:53:01] it in war in those kinds of
[1:53:05] things you're going to get
[1:53:09] wounded you're going to get your mind uh
[1:53:12] uh in this in this gospel War you're

[1:53:38] mailbox everyone get out however you
[1:53:44] can
[1:53:48] recovery and we've got the greatest
[1:53:51] recovery POS policy than any of anybody
[1:53:53] else I say I I I I say they're in
[1:53:57] they're in first John where's that at
[1:54:00] first first John uh is it one and no uh
[1:54:03] one and one brother I say that you sin
[1:54:06] not but if you do sin we have an
[1:54:08] advocate with the father two 1 John 2
[1:54:12] and
[1:54:14] one
[1:54:20] amen my little children these things are
[1:54:22] write unto you that you sin not and if
[1:54:24] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[1:54:26] father Christ Jesus the
[1:54:28] righteous for he is the perpetuation for
[1:54:31] our sins and not our sins only but for
[1:54:32] the sins of the
[1:54:34] world hereby we know that we know him if
[1:54:39] we keep his
[1:54:41] commandments so we
[1:54:45] know oh blessed be the name of the
[1:54:50] Lord you know what that means
[1:54:54] that means tonight if there's one of you
[1:54:56] young people that are missing the
[1:54:59] mark there's plenty of
[1:55:02] blood if there's any mamas and daddies
[1:55:05] grandpas and grandmas preachers deacons
[1:55:09] trustees Sunday school
[1:55:11] teachers
[1:55:14] musicians
[1:55:18] Pastor we've got an advocate
[1:55:23] and we got to get back up and we got to
[1:55:24] keep pressing toward that goal can you
[1:55:27] say am man I believe it was brother
[1:55:30] Timothy one time when he was preaching
[1:55:31] here he was talking that he had read
[1:55:34] something about those that were as they
[1:55:37] were storming the uh uh coming in on the
[1:55:40] shores of Normandy and and and it got
[1:55:44] such such a bad deal and they were there
[1:55:47] were some of them that were
[1:55:49] wounded and it and it seemed like they
[1:55:51] weren't
[1:55:52] going to make it
[1:55:54] and but but those soldiers said that
[1:55:57] they would draw a line in the
[1:55:59] sand man and they were struggling get
[1:56:02] across and then they'd get up and they'
[1:56:03] draw another Line in the Sand and then
[1:56:05] they they'd struggle and then they'd get
[1:56:07] another line and they said they'd done
[1:56:08] that until they were able to reach where
[1:56:10] they were going but they had to keep
[1:56:12] they had to keep their heads about them
[1:56:14] to get to safety to get over where they
[1:56:16] belonged and I say tonight by the by the
[1:56:19] blood of Jesus Christ that we will not
[1:56:22] we will not bow to the powers of the
[1:56:25] devil in our lives can you say
[1:56:28] Amen aren't you in love with him here
[1:56:31] this

[1:57:27] goal to be everything that God wants me
[1:57:30] to

[2:09:29] are all of the announcements oh I want
[2:09:31] to
[2:09:32] say what a blessing everyone was to
[2:09:35] brother Austin and Sister Rose Friday
[2:09:38] and Saturday and I say a great big God
[2:09:41] bless
[2:09:45] you and um I'm want to tell you these
[2:09:50] boys and girls girls came and helped me
[2:09:53] on Friday and
[2:09:57] uh these the these guys
[2:10:01] worked they took all of that La plaster
[2:10:05] the guys the boys took all of the LA
[2:10:07] plaster totally off of that
[2:10:09] house and that was
[2:10:11] work and then uh the girls were doing
[2:10:16] sheetrock work on the inside of the
[2:10:19] house amen and uh uh and some of them
[2:10:24] was the first time that they had ever
[2:10:25] done anything like that and and they
[2:10:28] volunteered to come and
[2:10:30] help now we can't guarantee you what
[2:10:33] it's going to look like but that's
[2:10:34] Austin's fault for letting us go work
[2:10:36] over there amen but
[2:10:40] uh no no we know it's going to look good
[2:10:44] because we have got two
[2:10:47] professional uh mutton
[2:10:49] tapers Amy
[2:10:52] Gonzalez and Tina
[2:10:55] Martin
[2:11:02] and I just want you to know those girls
[2:11:04] walked in that house yesterday and they
[2:11:06] about died amen not because of the girls
[2:11:09] not because of the girls no that sounded
[2:11:12] bad
[2:11:15] that you just okay so when Austin bought
[2:11:18] this house they had already put they had
[2:11:20] already put some Sheetrock in and they
[2:11:23] done it
[2:11:26] Hallelujah well then um well then we had
[2:11:30] to cut out a little bit to get or uh the
[2:11:33] guys or whoever cut cut out to put all
[2:11:36] the electric in the walls so then we
[2:11:39] have we have this going all the way
[2:11:40] around the house and then
[2:11:44] then brother Austin wanted to take out
[2:11:46] all of those those wide all of that wide
[2:11:49] trim around the doors and the window and
[2:11:51] just take all of that out and I tried to
[2:11:54] get him to leave it up there but uh we
[2:11:57] had to change out the windows anyway so
[2:11:59] um so we took all of so behind that so
[2:12:02] when they put the sheet rock up they did
[2:12:05] they just butt it up against that sixin
[2:12:07] trim so now we got six Ines all the way
[2:12:10] around every window and door frame and
[2:12:14] everything and so it is pieced together
[2:12:18] it it sort of looks like a jigsaw p
[2:12:22] with without a
[2:12:25] picture but um but these girls are are
[2:12:28] going to do a a fine job these
[2:12:32] ladies we appreciate them volunteer to
[2:12:36] help I'm I'm going to help get the mud
