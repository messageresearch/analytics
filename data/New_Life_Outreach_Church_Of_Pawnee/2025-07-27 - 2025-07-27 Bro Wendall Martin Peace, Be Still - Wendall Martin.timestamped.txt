[36:31] [Music]
[36:34] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:39] Cover me. I'm so glad that we have a
[36:42] covering through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[36:45] Amen. And I'm I'm so glad to belong to
[36:49] the redeemed family of God. And And I'm
[36:52] glad to be here tonight with you. Amen.
[36:55] All of the believers together. And we
[36:59] say God richly bless you. Did you enjoy
[37:01] the message this morning? Amen.
[37:06] Let it be the word or nothing. That's
[37:08] what we want. Amen. Is the is the word
[37:11] of God. I I want us to look here in the
[37:14] book of First Corinthians the 15th
[37:17] chapter. And I do want to say it's just
[37:19] so nice to have brother Timothy and and
[37:22] Sister Ashley and the family uh to be
[37:24] here with us again tonight is a surprise
[37:27] surprise this morning and a surprise
[37:29] tonight. Amen. And uh uh we're very
[37:33] proud of what the Lord is doing there in
[37:36] in Noel, Missouri. And um I I know that
[37:40] they've got a wonderful man of God and
[37:43] and a and a great family of God. Praise
[37:45] the Lord. And uh so Amen. Um we're we're
[37:50] going to
[37:52] Um, look here at at uh
[37:56] 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and the
[37:59] 19th verse. And don't turn me down too
[38:01] very low. My voice is pretty weak
[38:03] tonight. But it says, "If this life if
[38:06] we in this life only
[38:09] we have hope in Christ,
[38:12] we of all men are most miserable." So we
[38:18] as a believer, even as a believer, if we
[38:21] have hope only in this life, then we
[38:26] we've we've got
[38:29] there's not too much to look forward to.
[38:31] But now is Christ risen from the dead
[38:34] and become the first fruits of them that
[38:36] slept. For since by man come death, by
[38:39] man also the resurrection of the dead.
[38:43] For as in Adam all die, even so in
[38:46] Christ shall all be made alive, and
[38:49] every man in his own order. Christ the
[38:53] first fruits. Afterward, they that are
[38:57] Christ at his coming. Now, we're going
[38:59] to read a little bit more, but I'm going
[39:01] to let's let's have a word of prayer and
[39:02] let you have your seats.
[39:05] Father, we want to thank you today.
[39:07] Thank you for this great peace that you
[39:10] have given us that we have found through
[39:12] your blood. And I I thank you, Lord, for
[39:17] your redeeming grace. How that you have
[39:20] sought us out,
[39:22] Lord. You've you've known exactly where
[39:25] we were born. You've known exactly
[39:28] everything about us. Lord, you know
[39:30] everything about me. You know all of you
[39:34] you you you know all of the misgivings
[39:36] in my mind and heart. You know all the
[39:40] you you know everything about me. And
[39:43] Lord, you know everything about every
[39:46] man and woman in this building here
[39:48] tonight. And you've brought us to your
[39:50] grace, Lord, because you have loved us.
[39:55] And you've you've brought us, Lord, to
[39:58] where you can mend us. and and and Lord,
[40:02] make us like you. And we thank you for
[40:04] that. Now, Lord, we're just asking that
[40:07] your words of life would minister to our
[40:10] hearts tonight. And we'll give you glory
[40:12] and honor in Jesus name we pray. Can the
[40:16] church say amen?
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated
[40:20] here today. I'd like to continue on
[40:23] down. Amen. in the start at the 42nd
[40:28] verse. Amen. Now, we're all a part of
[40:32] Adam's fall. We all die because of
[40:36] Adam's
[40:38] Adam's
[40:40] uh fall and and his sin. But Christ has
[40:44] come to bring us life.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; And that life is what is most important
[40:50] to us all. And I want us to look at eman
[40:54] this the promise that has been given to
[40:57] us in the 42nd verse of the 15th
[40:59] chapter. So also is the resurrection of
[41:02] dead of the dead. It is sown in
[41:04] corruption. It is raised in
[41:06] incorruption.
[41:08] It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in
[41:12] glory. It is sown in weakness. It is
[41:15] raised in power. It is sown in a natural
[41:19] body. It is raised in a spiritual body.
[41:23] There is a natural body and there is a
[41:25] spiritual body. So it is written the
[41:29] first man Adam was a living soul but the
[41:32] last man Adam was a quickening spirit.
[41:35] How be it that was not first which is
[41:38] spiritual but that which is natural and
[41:41] afterwards that which is spiritual. The
[41:44] first man is from earth. That is from
[41:46] your first birth. That is where we're
[41:47] born. We're born sinners. We're born
[41:51] We're born with We're really born with
[41:54] all of our wires messed up.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing's computing the way that
[41:59] it should be. We're all We're not We're
[42:01] not in an old uh mechanic uh uh
[42:05] terminology. We're not running on all
[42:07] eight cylinders. We're not here. We're
[42:09] not there yet. Amen. because of the sin.
[42:13] It says um it
[42:18] where was I at? Hallelujah. Amen. 47.
[42:23] The first man is of the earthy.
[42:26] The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[42:29] As is the earthly, such are they also
[42:31] that are earthly. As is the heavenly,
[42:34] such are they also that are heavenly. As
[42:37] we have borne the image of the earthly,
[42:40] we shall also bear the image of the
[42:42] heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that
[42:45] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[42:47] kingdom of God.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Neither does corruption inherit
[42:51] incorruption. But I show you a mystery
[42:54] that we shall not all sleep, but we
[42:55] shall all be changed in a moment, in the
[42:58] twinkling of an eye at the last trump.
[43:01] For the trump shall sound, and the dead
[43:04] shall be raised incorruptible, and we
[43:06] shall be changed. For this corruptible
[43:09] shall put on incorruption, and this
[43:11] mortal must put on immortality.
[43:14] So when this corruptible shall have put
[43:16] on incorruption, and this mortal shall
[43:18] be put shall have put on immortality,
[43:21] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[43:24] that is written, "Death is swallowed up
[43:26] in victory. Oh, death, where is thy
[43:29] steam? Oh grave, where is thy victory?
[43:32] The sting of death is sin. The strength
[43:35] of sin is the law. But thanks be to God
[43:39] which gives us the victory through our
[43:43] Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:46] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be
[43:48] steadfast,
[43:49] unmovable,
[43:51] always abounding in the work of the
[43:53] Lord. For as much as you know that your
[43:56] labor is not in vain
[43:58] &gt;&gt; in the Lord.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that just wonderful?
[44:02] &gt;&gt; That's the hope of what we that's that's
[44:05] our hope that the hope of a Christian.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why Jesus said,
[44:10] "You must be born again."
[44:12] &gt;&gt; And when Nicodemus says, "Well, we
[44:14] don't. How can I be born again? How can
[44:17] a man go back into his mother's womb?"
[44:20] And Jesus says, "Oh, the flesh is of the
[44:22] flesh." But what God is doing is he's
[44:25] restoring something back. Restoring us
[44:28] back to the original. Amen. There is a a
[44:31] relationship back with God.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Now, every one of us, I don't care how
[44:37] cute you are and how handsome you are.
[44:40] Amen. We are all from the fall. We are
[44:43] all in a fallen condition.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I used to have a full head of
[44:48] hair. I I I I I
[44:51] used to used to have a voice that wasn't
[44:54] crackly. I used to used to have uh uh
[44:59] you know, I I didn't have scars on my
[45:03] body and didn't have to deal with my bad
[45:05] back and my joints that that ache and
[45:08] burn and Amen. I I I but but as I live,
[45:13] the the more that I find that I am I am
[45:16] finite. I've got these wrinkles on my
[45:18] hands and in my face and Amen. It shows
[45:21] that I can't live here. I I I'm I'm in a
[45:24] I'm in a fallen body.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; And if your if your body is fallen, so
[45:30] is your mind.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Your mind is is is is your mind isn't
[45:35] the way God originally made it.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can't depend on our mind.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; We can't depend on our body.
[45:44] You put you put your confidence in your
[45:46] body and before you know it, Amen. One
[45:49] mishap, one wreck or one or or just
[45:52] getting old and and and and and and you
[45:54] start losing your hair, you start
[45:56] turning gray, you start getting fat
[45:58] after the babies are here. You've got
[45:59] your you you you've got the the the the
[46:02] the baby fat. You've got all of these
[46:04] things here that would ruin what you
[46:07] would think would be perfect. There is
[46:09] nothing perfect about you.
[46:11] We're all born with with our minds
[46:14] muddled
[46:15] &gt;&gt; and messed up.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; But there is a promise. And as I as I
[46:19] get older, I begin to think about that
[46:21] life and what that what that heavenly
[46:24] life means.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; As I'm getting older, I'm beginning to
[46:28] I'm beginning to think, amen, more about
[46:30] that life than what I can do with this
[46:32] life.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; I'm beginning to see what matters to me
[46:36] most. What matters to me most is not
[46:39] riches and houses and land and it's not
[46:42] what I can possess. Amen. But it's what
[46:45] I do possess in this new birth that God
[46:49] has given me.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. This one can't last. This is full
[46:55] of sorrow and misery. Amen. as as good
[46:59] of his life as as it's been. Even being
[47:01] a Christian, it it's full of sickness
[47:04] and sorrow and misery. Amen. And hurt
[47:08] there. It's this life, Amen. is is is
[47:11] full of death. Everywhere you look, it's
[47:14] death.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; The trees out there right now that look
[47:18] pretty. Amen. With this hate that's
[47:20] coming in, the grass is starting to
[47:22] burn. Leaves are starting to turn
[47:24] colors. is because there's nothing
[47:27] that's lasting here.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that's lasting here.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:34] It won't be long and everything will
[47:36] begin to die.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Well, so will a man. I don't care how
[47:40] young and beautiful or how young and
[47:42] good-looking you are.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Man, there's nothing of this earth
[47:45] that'll last.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; But what we have, we have a promise. We
[47:52] have a promise that we're going back to
[47:54] that that God amen ordained. Well,
[47:57] praise the Lord. The Bible says there in
[48:00] second Peter 3 and9 the Lord is not
[48:03] slack concerning his promise as some
[48:05] count slackness but is longsuffering to
[48:08] us for
[48:10] &gt;&gt; oh longsuffering. God knows us where we
[48:12] are and he's longsuffering.
[48:16] not willing that any of us should
[48:17] perish, but that all should come to
[48:19] repentance. But the day of the Lord will
[48:22] come as a thief in the night, in which
[48:23] the heavens shall pass away with a with
[48:26] a great noise, and the elements shall
[48:28] melt with fervent heat, and the earth
[48:30] also, and the works that are therein
[48:32] shall be burned up. Seeing then that all
[48:35] these things shall be dissolved, what
[48:37] manner of persons ought ye to be in holy
[48:40] conversation or lifestyle and godliness,
[48:43] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[48:46] of the day of God, wherein the heavens
[48:49] being on fire shall be dissolved, and
[48:51] the elements shall melt uh with fervent
[48:53] heat. Nevertheless, we according to the
[48:56] promise look for a new heaven and a new
[48:59] earth wherein dwells righteousness.
[49:03] This is something that God has given us.
[49:04] There's going to be a land where there's
[49:07] no turmoil in the mind.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a land. We are We
[49:12] are preparing for a land where there
[49:14] will be no more Amen. burying our mamas
[49:17] and grandmas, burying our children.
[49:19] We're going to a land where there is
[49:22] where where there is peace of mind,
[49:25] peace of heart,
[49:28] &gt;&gt; where there is no sorrow, where there is
[49:30] no no uh h regrets of yesterday.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Where we're not hurt and where others
[49:40] can't hurt us.
[49:42] We're preparing for that.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; The the resurrection is genuine. Brother
[49:48] Brandon was asked one time by his wife.
[49:51] He said, "Amen. Uh uh
[49:55] uh you know, Billy, you're you're losing
[49:58] your hair." Amen. And he says, "I want
[50:00] you to know I've not lost a one." And
[50:02] she says, "Well, well, pray tell me
[50:05] where where your hair's going." Amen. He
[50:08] says, "I'll I'll ask you a question. You
[50:10] tell me where they came from before I
[50:13] got them, and I'll tell you they're
[50:15] there waiting on me. Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; I came from the earth.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And you all, every one of us come from
[50:22] the 16 elements. For now, science says
[50:24] 21 elements of the earth. Amen. We've
[50:27] all come from that. Your hair came from
[50:30] that. Everything about you, you come
[50:31] from that element. And I just want to
[50:34] tell you the power of that resurrection
[50:36] is so great, Kobe, that no matter where
[50:39] we are, no matter if this if if there
[50:42] was a bomb and I exploded, hallelujah,
[50:44] and pieces of me went that way and that
[50:47] way and that way and that way and that
[50:49] way and every which way. When the
[50:51] resurrection come, there will not be one
[50:54] hair lost.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; There will not be one body part missing.
[51:01] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:05] Sister Denise, you're fixing to have
[51:07] some things taken out of you.
[51:08] Hallelujah. But when you get on the
[51:10] other side, you're not going to be a
[51:12] half of a woman. You're going to be
[51:15] you're going you're going to be
[51:16] everything. Amen. That God had in the
[51:19] beginning in his mind.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; The resurrection,
[51:24] there is a peace that comes.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a there this is Amen. on
[51:29] that resurrection morning. There is
[51:32] nothing that is going to be left behind.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to say we're making
[51:36] preparation for that right now.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. The new birth is not coming to
[51:41] church. It's not turning a new leaf. The
[51:43] new birth is where God comes in and does
[51:45] something really special for you.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; He comes in and changes you and he puts
[51:51] the pieces together. Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:54] Right now in your when you're when
[51:56] you're not born again. Amen. Your mind
[51:59] and your and and and your body and
[52:01] things just aren't quite there. Your
[52:03] soul, it's not that the the wires aren't
[52:06] all connected together yet. But when God
[52:08] comes into that soul, he connects the
[52:11] pieces and the wires come together to
[52:14] where you can communicate with God to
[52:16] where you feel whole.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Because of the fall, every man dies.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was asked of a doctor. Do you
[52:29] believe that we're made of the elements
[52:31] of the earth? And he says, "Well, of
[52:33] course, man." He says, "Uh, that's why
[52:37] we have to live off the food of the
[52:38] earth because we all came from the earth
[52:41] to replenish the vitamins and minerals
[52:43] in our bodies." And and then the prophet
[52:45] would ask, he said, "Then why is it that
[52:48] that I'm eating the same foods that I
[52:51] ate when I was a kid?
[52:54] When I was a kid, I ate those foods and
[52:57] I got strong and stronger and stronger
[53:01] and and taller. I grew. But there came a
[53:04] certain time to where I'm eating the
[53:06] same food and now I'm getting weaker and
[53:09] weaker and weaker.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; What what what caused it? He says, he
[53:15] says it would be like this this glass of
[53:17] water and you're pouring the water in
[53:19] and it comes up and it comes up and it
[53:21] comes up and then all of a sudden it
[53:24] reaches a peak and then it begins to go
[53:26] down further and it the more you pour in
[53:29] the lower it goes.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; You see that's where we are.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; We we there is nothing eternal here.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I will say here, amen,
[53:45] as just as God in the original was
[53:49] creating Adam
[53:52] and when he was thinking of Adam in his
[53:54] mind, I believe God had a real special
[53:56] thought for every one of you. Just like
[53:59] he had a special thought for Adam, he
[54:02] knew us all. And before God created
[54:05] Adam,
[54:06] &gt;&gt; he man, he had to create the earth.
[54:09] That's right.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Every carpenter has to lay out his
[54:11] materials.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He looks at his plans and and and
[54:16] and the design and and and then he then
[54:19] he goes and he and he and he brings his
[54:22] materials in. How many knows that, you
[54:23] know, with you us electricians or
[54:25] carpenters or whatever, you bring your
[54:27] materials in, get it all lined up
[54:29] together so that you can do your
[54:30] project.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Well, God couldn't just go pick up some
[54:34] things when making use. So God had to
[54:37] create a world for you.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; God created Amen. If you could if you
[54:43] could think of it like this, a great
[54:45] Amen. the great clinker. Amen. When the
[54:47] earth, it was just a a just a clinker
[54:51] off of the sun. May maybe a maybe a
[54:53] volcanic stone that that came off the
[54:56] sun and and the Bible says it was void
[54:59] and and it was it was shapeless and
[55:02] without form and there was chaos
[55:05] everywhere. Amen. And and God Amen. But
[55:09] what was God doing within that volcanic
[55:12] rock, if you will? Amen. Was everything
[55:16] that your body was going to be needing?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; God had developed it. God made the earth
[55:23] with a specific purpose
[55:25] &gt;&gt; to make man.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Within that rock, God knew what he
[55:32] was doing within the earth. This void
[55:35] form formless earth, this chaotic earth
[55:38] that was dark.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But yet in that earth was
[55:44] was potsh and calcium and phosphorus and
[55:48] there there was sulfur and sodium and
[55:52] zinc and and magnesium and copper and
[55:56] everything everything that was going to
[55:58] be needed to create you.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; God put it all together. Hallelujah.
[56:06] God would begin his project
[56:08] and he'd begin to turn the earth around
[56:10] the sun and Amen. begin to begin to move
[56:14] it around and shape it the way he wanted
[56:17] it. Amen. And molding it and shaping it
[56:20] because he had a he had a grand scheme.
[56:23] He was fixing to bring life
[56:26] out of something that was formless.
[56:29] Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; He was fixing to bring light into a
[56:34] world that was dark. He was fixing to
[56:37] take nothingness and to bring something
[56:40] out of it. Now, I want you to catch this
[56:42] because I I I want you to truly
[56:44] understand when God was making this, the
[56:47] earth already contained everything that
[56:51] was needed.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; But yet, it was dark without form. It
[56:56] was void. There was nothing in it.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; But yet God knew what was on the inside.
[57:05] And let me just say this here tonight,
[57:06] just sort of getting ahead of my
[57:08] thoughts. When God in you, in your walk,
[57:12] in your life right now, sometimes it can
[57:15] seem dark.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's like it's void.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes because of our past.
[57:27] Amen. Maybe sometimes we're born. We we
[57:30] we we were born while mom and dad were
[57:34] we're we're were we're we're in we're
[57:36] we're we're we're we're on drugs. And
[57:39] maybe maybe that has shaped some portion
[57:42] of our life.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; M maybe maybe we were uh molested as a
[57:48] child.
[57:49] M maybe we were hurt when we were when
[57:53] we were in in in some point and
[57:56] somewhere it just seems like our life
[57:59] has been with was shapeless. It seems
[58:02] like it's had no purpose. It seems like
[58:06] there's been nothing there. And and you
[58:08] might look in the mirror and you might
[58:10] say, "I don't like the man that I see."
[58:17] But on the inside,
[58:20] God's already got a design for you. On
[58:23] the inside is a soul.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; On the inside, God's all Are you hearing
[58:29] me? The earth
[58:32] &gt;&gt; was without form. It was void.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; It was empty.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; It was dark.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; It looked hopeless.
[58:42] But when God, according to his purpose,
[58:45] God knew what he was doing. And God
[58:48] would take the earth, begin to rotate it
[58:50] around the sun, and begin to mold it and
[58:53] make it because God was fixing to build
[58:57] a masterpiece.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; God's good at taking nothingness
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and making masterpieces.
[59:13] God's good at taking us when we don't
[59:16] even understand ourselves.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; When we don't even understand our
[59:21] purpose. When we look in the mirror, we
[59:24] don't we don't we don't know why we are
[59:26] like we are. And we don't know what is
[59:29] going to help us to change. And we just
[59:32] we want to hide. But here, where are we
[59:34] going to go? God sees that. And I want
[59:38] to say God knew it was going to be there
[59:41] before you was ever born.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; God's already placed something on the
[59:48] inside of you and he's going to bring
[59:51] out a masterpiece in you.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:03] God would begin to take this this
[1:00:06] volcanic rock, if you will,
[1:00:13] and the great pillar of fire would be
[1:00:14] like a little dove.
[1:00:17] It would come upon that earth and it
[1:00:20] would come down and begin to melt a
[1:00:23] little bit of this pot ash and a little
[1:00:25] bit of this and begin to begin to melt
[1:00:28] and begin to form and before you know
[1:00:30] it, up come a little Easter lily.
[1:00:33] And God would say, "That's good."
[1:00:37] God would take this rock and then he
[1:00:39] would as he would hover and make love to
[1:00:42] it and and and and begin to brood over
[1:00:45] the earth, that pillar of fire and
[1:00:48] before you know it, here come the botney
[1:00:50] light. Flowers begin to grow and trees
[1:00:53] begin to grow.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Before you know it, the great forest,
[1:00:59] Mount Everest, come. Amen. Before you
[1:01:01] know it, there were there were all of
[1:01:03] these things begin to come up because
[1:01:05] the Holy Spirit was bring the seeds were
[1:01:08] already there.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Go back and read the Bible. The Bible
[1:01:14] didn't say that God created those seeds.
[1:01:17] He says he gave permission for those
[1:01:19] seeds
[1:01:22] to live and to pre-produce.
[1:01:25] Can you say amen?
[1:01:28] We look at those, we understand that
[1:01:31] those seeds were created from another
[1:01:34] were there from another civilization.
[1:01:38] But God created and I just want to say
[1:01:43] those seeds that God originally had in
[1:01:45] his mind concerning you,
[1:01:48] in his mind before the sin, before the
[1:01:50] fall, before those kinds of things that
[1:01:51] ever come into play, those seeds were
[1:01:54] already there from another civilization.
[1:01:56] And it was a heavenly civilization.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; And all God does, God will bring he
[1:02:02] he'll come and brood over your soul and
[1:02:04] he'll come and move upon you. Oh, can
[1:02:06] you say amen? Amen. As he begin to make
[1:02:09] love to the earth and the elements begin
[1:02:11] to
[1:02:13] melt and soon came up a lily and the
[1:02:16] botney life begin to grow and and then
[1:02:18] one by one the animal life begin to come
[1:02:21] as as God was brooding over the earth.
[1:02:24] And how excited God must have been to
[1:02:26] see how his plan was coming together.
[1:02:30] He was bringing chaos.
[1:02:33] He was turning the chaos into order.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; When we come to the Lord, we don't have
[1:02:43] it all made up. When we come to God, our
[1:02:47] lives are full of wretchedness.
[1:02:51] And sometimes on the inside,
[1:02:54] I man,
[1:02:56] you look and you look at the great big
[1:02:58] oak tree and you say, "I'd love to be
[1:03:01] that."
[1:03:03] You look at this. You think, "If I could
[1:03:05] be that."
[1:03:07] You look around and here you are in your
[1:03:10] brokenness.
[1:03:12] But I just want to say, "Amen. God's got
[1:03:15] a seed down deep in the heart for that
[1:03:17] to come up."
[1:03:19] And it and God knows what he's making.
[1:03:22] Are y'all are y'all understanding what
[1:03:24] I'm saying? Amen. What What was God
[1:03:26] doing? He was bringing life. He was
[1:03:30] bring He was turning chaos into order.
[1:03:33] He was beginning life was beginning to
[1:03:36] come forth. Life and joy and peace and
[1:03:40] tranquility and harmony and love. And
[1:03:44] God was looking there with great pride
[1:03:47] and and and and and love and
[1:03:49] appreciation as he watched the birds
[1:03:52] chirp and the butterfly go from flower
[1:03:54] to flower. He was there watching Leo the
[1:03:58] lion and and and and Miss Cheetah
[1:04:01] walking down. It was a beautiful thing
[1:04:04] that God had made.
[1:04:14] But this was only setting the stage for
[1:04:17] the grand finale.
[1:04:21] This was beautiful. This was good.
[1:04:24] But this was only setting the stage. God
[1:04:26] was just building all of the props
[1:04:30] for his greatest intention was man.
[1:04:34] God was fixing to build a masterpiece of
[1:04:38] his own image.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; God was fixing and I I He was fixing to
[1:04:45] create himself.
[1:04:47] He was fixing to build
[1:04:55] one just like him.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And he would give dominion
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; and authority.
[1:05:04] This man would walk as God would walk.
[1:05:07] Are Are you hearing me? He designed the
[1:05:10] earth. He created all of the plains of
[1:05:15] Kansas, the the the hills of Arkansas,
[1:05:18] the the m the rugged mountains of Utah.
[1:05:22] He He's created the
[1:05:26] the rugged terrain of Oklahoma.
[1:05:28] Hallelujah.
[1:05:30] He created He created it all for his
[1:05:33] children. He created the variety of
[1:05:36] flowers. There was white flowers, blue
[1:05:38] flowers, red flowers, purple flowers.
[1:05:41] God created these for his children that
[1:05:43] he was fixing to create.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; God God was making it the the the great
[1:05:49] waterfalls coming down. He was doing it
[1:05:52] for the purpose
[1:05:54] of his children. Right?
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; The day come when God made Adam and this
[1:06:01] would be the highlight of all of his
[1:06:02] creation. This would be the highest of
[1:06:04] all species. God would make this man.
[1:06:07] God would make this. Let us make man in
[1:06:10] our own image. God was going to make his
[1:06:12] very own son.
[1:06:18] This created being would reflect the
[1:06:20] very image of God. For God is now
[1:06:23] creating his own species
[1:06:27] and man would be their sole ruler over
[1:06:29] the creation.
[1:06:31] But Adam was lonely.
[1:06:35] Adam was lonely.
[1:06:39] The Bible,
[1:06:41] brother Brandon would tell us that he
[1:06:43] had something within him that he needed
[1:06:45] to express because
[1:06:48] Adam was both male and female in the one
[1:06:51] person.
[1:06:54] And here he was living in this body, but
[1:06:58] yet here he was.
[1:07:01] He didn't have a way to express. He
[1:07:04] didn't he was lonely.
[1:07:06] So the Bible says that God put Adam to
[1:07:08] sleep and he pulled out of his rib and
[1:07:13] he created out of Adam, not the dirt,
[1:07:15] out of Adam, he created a woman.
[1:07:19] He created a help me.
[1:07:22] Are are you hearing me? Eve was not new.
[1:07:27] Eve would find her fulfillment in Adam
[1:07:31] because Eve was created in Adam.
[1:07:36] Amen.
[1:07:38] And here, Amen. as as as as when Adam
[1:07:43] grew up woke up and Amen. He he would he
[1:07:48] would see this beautiful bride and he
[1:07:52] would take her out and show her his
[1:07:55] world and and and begin to amen explain.
[1:07:58] I I I I've named all of these animals.
[1:08:01] Look at what father has given. and Adam
[1:08:04] and Eve was in was in perfect harmony.
[1:08:07] It was a beautiful thing.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Then we understand that the serpent
[1:08:14] crawled underneath the gates of the
[1:08:16] garden and
[1:08:20] he would lure Eve and bring death upon
[1:08:22] the earth and then the whole creation
[1:08:25] would mourn.
[1:08:30] Creation would mourn. I I I believe that
[1:08:34] the sun even darkened. The clouds came
[1:08:36] over. The sun just refused to shine.
[1:08:40] The stars,
[1:08:43] the botney life, the animal life, the
[1:08:45] planets, the solar system, everything
[1:08:47] was trembling because God's son had
[1:08:50] fallen.
[1:08:52] And Adam and Eve would now be driven
[1:08:54] from the garden. And there would be a
[1:08:57] great cherubam that were that were put
[1:08:59] there to guard with flaming swords of
[1:09:02] fire. And no man would ever be able to
[1:09:05] get to the tree of life or to come into
[1:09:08] that garden. And now it is chaos and
[1:09:10] brokenness.
[1:09:13] Chaos and brokenness would now become
[1:09:15] the norm of this new creation.
[1:09:19] Chaos and brokenness. Because man and
[1:09:22] woman without God is broken.
[1:09:26] And when a man or a woman is out of
[1:09:28] their place, creation has no ruler.
[1:09:30] There is no master. So creation in
[1:09:33] itself
[1:09:34] would be broken and without a ruler.
[1:09:38] Eve's very own son killed his twin
[1:09:41] brother.
[1:09:43] It was a spiral of of of
[1:09:49] regrets.
[1:09:52] I hope I'm okay here tonight. Not going
[1:09:54] to hold you too too long. So, y'all stay
[1:09:56] with me.
[1:09:59] You can see Adam and Eve
[1:10:04] going to the garden gate and remembering
[1:10:07] the things that used to be inside it.
[1:10:11] Adam and Eve remembered what it was like
[1:10:13] to walk with God. Adam and Eve, they
[1:10:15] remembered what it was like to
[1:10:17] fellowship with God in the evening.
[1:10:20] Adam and Eve knew these things.
[1:10:23] But now here they are in brokenness.
[1:10:27] There's their bodies are getting old.
[1:10:32] There's no fellowship between them and
[1:10:33] God.
[1:10:37] The eldest Eve's eldest son has now
[1:10:40] killed
[1:10:42] his brother.
[1:10:48] It's chaos.
[1:10:51] And the world has gone through chaos.
[1:10:53] There's been wars. There's been there's
[1:10:55] been
[1:10:57] rumors of wars. The the the earth has
[1:10:59] been full of just madness forever.
[1:11:06] God even said he was going to have to he
[1:11:08] repented making man because of all the
[1:11:10] sin and the great flood come and Monoah
[1:11:12] was the only one saved and
[1:11:16] but all along God's
[1:11:19] given a promise
[1:11:21] that there would be somebody that would
[1:11:23] be able to find peace. And now from the
[1:11:25] rest of this my thoughts here for the
[1:11:27] next 10 minutes, I want you to really
[1:11:28] listen to me
[1:11:31] because mankind was not just kicked out
[1:11:33] of the garden. And that story that I
[1:11:35] told you is a real story.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Man has great built great feats.
[1:11:42] It was after the Garden of Eden that man
[1:11:44] got together and they was going to build
[1:11:46] a tower that would reach God. They
[1:11:48] wanted to reach God.
[1:11:50] They wanted to commune because they they
[1:11:52] they lack peace. They missed peace.
[1:11:59] They were guilty. They come under the
[1:12:02] condemnation
[1:12:04] of of of God's law. They sinned. And
[1:12:09] everyone
[1:12:11] that is born is built or is born under
[1:12:16] the condemnation of of guilt.
[1:12:22] guilt come is it's a judicial thing.
[1:12:25] You're pronounced guilty. Amen. The
[1:12:28] gabble is dropped.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; You're pronounced guilty and the
[1:12:31] punishment must follow.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Peace
[1:12:37] is also a judicial thing.
[1:12:40] When you can have peace with God means
[1:12:43] somebody has satisfied the courts of the
[1:12:46] law. The the the courts of law
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; where the guilt is totally away.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; The guilt has been paid for.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like being guilty.
[1:13:04] We've seen we we've seen what the
[1:13:06] presidential pardon can do.
[1:13:12] where where where people are in prison
[1:13:15] because they've been guilty and
[1:13:17] President Trump they've spent years in
[1:13:20] in in in prison but with the signing of
[1:13:24] a stroke of his pen. He's been they've
[1:13:27] been pardoned pardoned with prejudice.
[1:13:31] That means it can never be brought up
[1:13:32] again. It means they can never be
[1:13:35] charged again. That means everything has
[1:13:39] been taken care of.
[1:13:41] Jesus Christ. This is the reason we
[1:13:45] needed Jesus in our Why did Jesus die?
[1:13:48] Because you had a guilty verdict.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I had a guilty verdict. And there is
[1:13:56] nothing there is nothing that religion
[1:13:59] can do to take away that guilt.
[1:14:07] They built a tower up to God trying to
[1:14:09] show God we want to come to you.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; But they were guilty.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Men has tried through their sacrifices.
[1:14:18] They've tried to to to earn God's
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; but they were guilty.
[1:14:24] A guilty man is guilty.
[1:14:27] Are you with me?
[1:14:34] you're guilty, somebody's got to take
[1:14:35] care of the payment.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; The reason that people are so messed up
[1:14:44] in their head today,
[1:14:47] the reason why people are still they go
[1:14:50] to church and yet they can't find peace
[1:14:52] is because God this coming to church
[1:14:55] don't give you peace.
[1:14:59] Playing music doesn't give you peace.
[1:15:01] Being a preacher doesn't give you peace.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Saying a prayer doesn't give you peace.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Because your soul is guilty. It's under
[1:15:11] the condemnation. It's been pronounced
[1:15:13] guilty. And there's only one that can
[1:15:15] remove that guilt from that soul. And
[1:15:19] that is one who would come to take your
[1:15:21] place.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody that's not guilty. Somebody
[1:15:26] that is able. a kinsman redeemer that is
[1:15:29] willing to take your place. Can I hear
[1:15:32] an amen?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus done. Jesus came.
[1:15:38] Jesus never sinned. Jesus never
[1:15:40] rebelled. Jesus was not born with the
[1:15:43] condemnation of the sexual birth. His
[1:15:46] father was God just like Adam was in the
[1:15:49] beginning.
[1:15:57] When Jesus died, he paid the penalty
[1:16:02] so that he could remove the guilt.
[1:16:05] He removes the guilt
[1:16:09] so that we can have peace.
[1:16:14] Peace,
[1:16:16] peace.
[1:16:18] Jesus was on the water.
[1:16:21] Jesus was on o on the waves and and and
[1:16:23] and there he was sleeping in the boat
[1:16:25] and they the disciples were trying. They
[1:16:27] were the the the the the
[1:16:31] uh the waves begin to to come and the
[1:16:34] winds begin to blow and the storm was on
[1:16:36] and Jesus was asleep and they've done
[1:16:39] everything they can. They're they're
[1:16:40] trying to get the water out of the boat.
[1:16:42] They're about to sink. They've done
[1:16:43] everything. Finally, they come and wake
[1:16:45] him up. Amen. in here. Peter, Peter was
[1:16:48] the he he was the head he he was a good
[1:16:51] fisherman. He was a great boatman. He
[1:16:54] told Jesus to go sleep. He told Jesus,
[1:16:56] "I've got this under control. Just rest
[1:16:58] up. I'll get you across to the other
[1:17:00] side." But now Peter is saying, "Wake
[1:17:03] the master lest we perish."
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus wakes up.
[1:17:11] Waves are blowing. The disciples saying,
[1:17:13] "We're fixing to die. We've done
[1:17:15] everything. We don't know what to do. We
[1:17:18] know nothing else to do. And Jesus, a
[1:17:20] man, stands up, puts his foot up on the
[1:17:23] the the bow of the ship, and he says,
[1:17:26] "Peace,
[1:17:29] be still."
[1:17:33] And that one word of that perfect son of
[1:17:36] God, all of a sudden,
[1:17:38] the winds quit blowing.
[1:17:43] The waves
[1:17:45] quit beating the boat.
[1:17:51] The disciples are all looking around and
[1:17:53] they're they're looking and they and
[1:17:56] they're fearful and they say, "What
[1:17:58] matter
[1:18:00] what manner of man
[1:18:02] is this?
[1:18:06] for even the winds
[1:18:10] and the waves obey him.
[1:18:14] They didn't realize that it was the same
[1:18:16] one
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; that took chaos and brought it into
[1:18:21] order at the beginning is the same one
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; that came in the body of Jesus
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; so that he could bring order and peace
[1:18:31] back into the human heart.
[1:18:35] That one that stood there and said,
[1:18:37] "Peace be still." Was the same God in
[1:18:42] the beginning that look at the
[1:18:44] brokenness of this world and the
[1:18:46] brokenness and the emptiness and the
[1:18:49] formlessness of it
[1:18:53] and he bought beauty.
[1:18:56] It was that God who came down
[1:19:00] to give his life to pay his own penalty
[1:19:06] so that he can bring order
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; into your chaos. Josh
[1:19:13] into your chaos. L
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; my wife said she must have went to the
[1:19:23] restroom, but it was chaos
[1:19:26] taking her from a broken family.
[1:19:31] Her mama was never married.
[1:19:34] Man after man after man,
[1:19:39] drugs and alcohol
[1:19:42] was was just an everyday thing there.
[1:19:46] Brokenness,
[1:19:47] parties,
[1:19:49] hurts,
[1:19:50] regrets.
[1:19:53] In fact, her whole family, she's a twin,
[1:19:58] been broken.
[1:20:01] But my wife at a at a young age,
[1:20:05] she came to the same tent that her whole
[1:20:07] family came. Her whole family came to
[1:20:09] that tent.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; The whole family come to the tent.
[1:20:21] But it was my wife that came up
[1:20:25] to Christ and said, "I want you to take
[1:20:27] my chaos.
[1:20:32] I don't want you to turn it. Bring
[1:20:35] order.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; I'm broken. I'm hurt. I've been I I I I
[1:20:43] come from brokenness.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; But there was something that was drawing
[1:20:49] that girl. It didn't draw anyone else at
[1:20:51] that time, but there was something about
[1:20:54] my wife. It was drawing her to Christ.
[1:20:58] Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And took that little
[1:21:04] girl, that little girl, and look at the
[1:21:07] beauty that God has made out of that
[1:21:10] life until here she is, a pastor's wife
[1:21:14] today.
[1:21:16] It's because somebody heard the words,
[1:21:20] "Peace."
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Peace in the midst of chaos. Peace in
[1:21:26] the midst of Amen. brokenness. Peace. We
[1:21:28] need to hear that from the Lord tonight.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; We need to hear that from him tonight.
[1:21:34] Peace.
[1:21:36] If you're in your brokenness and your
[1:21:37] mind is just gets roaring on the inside,
[1:21:40] I want to say the same one that stood on
[1:21:43] the boat that night is the same one that
[1:21:45] died on Calvary so that you can have
[1:21:49] peace.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:21:59] We were all guilty.
[1:22:02] Maybe
[1:22:05] you come from an alcoholic family or you
[1:22:08] came from maybe you were drug addicts.
[1:22:12] Maybe you were church members.
[1:22:18] You come from brokenness.
[1:22:21] And there's none of us that is there's
[1:22:23] not a human being on this earth
[1:22:28] that is not broken.
[1:22:30] I came from a a Christian family. Mom
[1:22:33] and dad were godly,
[1:22:36] but I was born broken.
[1:22:40] Maybe I wasn't molested when I was a
[1:22:42] child.
[1:22:43] Maybe may maybe you're the one that was
[1:22:45] molested. Maybe you were raped. Or maybe
[1:22:48] maybe you were done wrong. Maybe mom
[1:22:50] didn't love you or mom maybe there's a
[1:22:53] lot of things and those things shape our
[1:22:57] lives.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You take a little tree
[1:23:03] and it can be bent one way. You take
[1:23:05] that sapling and you you can train it
[1:23:08] and you can put a you can put a stick on
[1:23:10] it and it'll it'll but also and and and
[1:23:12] and when it grows up it'll grow up
[1:23:14] straight.
[1:23:16] But that same tree, if there was
[1:23:18] something else over it, man, and it
[1:23:21] won't let it grow up straight because
[1:23:22] something is over it. And it'll grow up
[1:23:25] crooked and it'll it'll it'll be hard on
[1:23:29] the root system. It'll be hard on a lot
[1:23:31] of things.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We were looking yesterday,
[1:23:35] brother Nathaniel, we we seen one of the
[1:23:37] trees that got that had got hit by, you
[1:23:40] know, winds and things and part of it
[1:23:42] was gone. And he says, "You know, if you
[1:23:43] want me to, we can just we can just cut
[1:23:45] cut it down a little ways and and and
[1:23:47] then and then, you know, put a ratchet
[1:23:49] strap on it and see if we can pull the
[1:23:51] tree back up." It had a fork and it was
[1:23:53] going like this. And he and and and I
[1:23:54] looked at and the thing is that big
[1:23:56] around. And I I said, you know, I just I
[1:23:58] just don't know. I I think it's
[1:24:00] impossible. And and so, you know, so he
[1:24:03] he just went ahead and cut the thing
[1:24:05] down. But God don't cut nothing down.
[1:24:11] God don't throw nothing away. He's not
[1:24:14] going to throw his elect away. He's not
[1:24:16] going to throw you away.
[1:24:19] He loves you. He loves you with an
[1:24:21] undying love. And when the world says it
[1:24:25] can't happen, maybe in your own mind you
[1:24:27] say it can't happen, but yet God's got a
[1:24:30] ratchet strap that's big. God can make
[1:24:33] something new. God can bring order into
[1:24:37] your chaos.
[1:24:39] God can do He's the God of miracles.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:24:50] Peace be still. I'm sorry.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Peace be still.
[1:25:01] You see, God
[1:25:03] is the one who created you.
[1:25:09] He knows how He knows how you're wired.
[1:25:15] And though the devil's got you all
[1:25:17] unwired,
[1:25:20] he knows how to put it all back
[1:25:21] together.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:25:28] You see what we've needed? We don't
[1:25:30] need, we don't need money.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Look at all the rich people out there.
[1:25:38] And they're on drugs and broken
[1:25:40] families.
[1:25:42] Money's just made them idiots.
[1:25:45] We don't need fame. Look at these famous
[1:25:47] guys. They can't They don't even have a
[1:25:49] lick of common sense anymore.
[1:25:52] We don't need fame.
[1:25:56] What we need is peace.
[1:26:00] And Jesus says the peace
[1:26:04] that I give,
[1:26:07] it's not the same kind of peace that the
[1:26:10] world would give through money or try to
[1:26:13] give through fame or try to give this.
[1:26:15] The peace that I give is the same peace
[1:26:20] that father god gave at the beginning.
[1:26:29] I've come to make everything right. I've
[1:26:32] come to make everything
[1:26:34] Well, can you say amen?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; To give you peace for the soul where you
[1:26:39] can actually stand up and you're no
[1:26:41] longer bent over, deformed.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; But this new birth could take that soul
[1:26:47] and lift you back up where you're not
[1:26:49] deformed anymore.
[1:26:52] where you can believe,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; where you can be productive,
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; where the grace of God is expressed
[1:26:59] through you to where you become the
[1:27:02] great masterpiece that God just like he
[1:27:06] had in the beginning when this world was
[1:27:08] formless without without hope. Can you
[1:27:12] say amen?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many wants that to be in your
[1:27:15] heart here tonight?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. here. Look what going back to the
[1:27:19] judicial term there in Romans 5 and1.
[1:27:22] Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[1:27:25] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:27:29] Jesus.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; It's been satisfied.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; The judge were saying, "You're guilty.
[1:27:41] All have sinned and come short of the
[1:27:42] glory of God." You are guilty. That's
[1:27:44] what God's word said.
[1:27:48] And God couldn't go back on his word.
[1:27:51] But God created
[1:27:55] himself a body
[1:27:59] because you weren't going to be able to
[1:28:00] help yourself cuz you're a sinner.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; My little this little young right here
[1:28:05] that I love so much, she's born in sin.
[1:28:11] Who could do it?
[1:28:13] man was in a shape.
[1:28:17] Hallelujah. That's an old southern word.
[1:28:20] He's in a shape. That that means things
[1:28:22] are really bad.
[1:28:32] Who was going to stand for us?
[1:28:37] Who was going to help us? We were born
[1:28:38] in defeat. Born in brokenness, born in
[1:28:42] families of brokenness.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Who's going to fight for us? Who's going
[1:28:48] to defend us?
[1:28:51] Mama don't care. Daddy don't care. This
[1:28:53] one don't care. The law don't care.
[1:28:56] God's looking down.
[1:28:59] He says, "I'll create a body
[1:29:01] and I'm going to live in that body and
[1:29:04] I'm going to go pay the penalty and I'm
[1:29:07] going to give that man, I'm going to
[1:29:09] give that boy, I'm going to give that
[1:29:10] girl peace." God almighty,
[1:29:19] I want to give him peace.
[1:29:22] Do you hear me?
[1:29:24] You see, that's what Christ is.
[1:29:28] justified by faith. Listen, 1
[1:29:31] Corinthians 14 and 33, it says, "For God
[1:29:35] is not the author of confusion,
[1:29:40] but of peace."
[1:29:44] Say it with me. God
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; is not the author
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; of confusion.
[1:29:53] He's the author
[1:29:56] of peace.
[1:29:58] If you could hear me tonight and you
[1:30:00] could you you could just take as I'm as
[1:30:02] I'm preaching from my from from my inner
[1:30:05] soul here right now.
[1:30:09] If you can take it,
[1:30:12] you'll connect all the wires together.
[1:30:20] He'll take He'll take everything about
[1:30:22] us. Are you understanding?
[1:30:26] You see, that's what God has done
[1:30:30] because God had it fixed to that
[1:30:31] virgin-b born son. Hallelujah.
[1:30:35] Amen. The blood of that virgin-born son
[1:30:37] would totally reverse. It would bring us
[1:30:39] back to the position of sons. It would
[1:30:41] be that living logos word living in a
[1:30:44] body to feel your pain and suffering. He
[1:30:47] was tempted in every point like you.
[1:30:50] Jesus Christ
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; was tempted in every point like you
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; yet without sin.
[1:31:03] If you ever think about the power of the
[1:31:05] blood,
[1:31:07] sometimes we need to go back and look at
[1:31:09] the power of the blood.
[1:31:12] Because if you really have an
[1:31:14] understanding of what that blood means
[1:31:16] when we say when we say
[1:31:20] you're washed with the blood, what we're
[1:31:22] trying to say is what that is a
[1:31:24] metaphor. That mean that doesn't mean to
[1:31:26] go and you're not trying to find some
[1:31:28] blood and wash yourself with it.
[1:31:31] It's the man, the righteous man, the God
[1:31:34] man, the holy man. Jesus Christ died and
[1:31:37] with his blood, it broke the powers of
[1:31:39] sin in your life.
[1:31:45] It breaks
[1:31:47] everything in your life so that the that
[1:31:49] the power of eternal life can flow
[1:31:52] through you and can live its way through
[1:31:55] you. I don't care how broken you are
[1:31:58] tonight.
[1:32:00] I don't care what your upbringing is. I
[1:32:03] don't care.
[1:32:06] I don't care about those things.
[1:32:09] I I don't care.
[1:32:12] You can take the vilest of sinners
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; and you can wash them with that blood.
[1:32:17] That blood is some detergent that is
[1:32:18] pretty powerful.
[1:32:24] They can take the power that has held
[1:32:27] you as a kid. Maybe maybe Uh uh you know
[1:32:30] there's there's there's been people in
[1:32:32] this building
[1:32:34] and and and and
[1:32:37] that that were molested
[1:32:40] when they were when they were kids and
[1:32:43] the power of that thing had affected
[1:32:46] them
[1:32:48] and it was a chain over them.
[1:32:51] But when the blood of Jesus comes in,
[1:32:54] you man, he has the power
[1:32:58] of that the the the power of that blood
[1:33:01] is greater than the power of that thing
[1:33:05] that has scarred your life.
[1:33:10] I've seen God take drag babies, amen,
[1:33:14] and had such a hard time. And I've seen
[1:33:18] God give them a new birth where they can
[1:33:21] think on their own and they can love God
[1:33:23] and they can praise families.
[1:33:28] I've seen God
[1:33:31] I've seen God take broken alcoholics and
[1:33:36] drug addicts and how God has made amen
[1:33:39] preachers out of them.
[1:33:45] They've seen them so bound by
[1:33:47] pornography,
[1:33:49] but the power of the blood
[1:33:52] is so great.
[1:33:57] Religion won't give you peace.
[1:34:02] It won't give you peace.
[1:34:04] You've got to come to the understanding
[1:34:07] that there was one. The reason why you
[1:34:09] don't have peace, the reason why you're
[1:34:11] in anguish in your heart, in your mind,
[1:34:14] is because you're under the condemnation
[1:34:17] of death, you're guilty.
[1:34:22] But if we can understand
[1:34:25] that this has already been paid for,
[1:34:29] your sins, your wrongs,
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; your iniquities have already been paid
[1:34:36] for.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; I've seen him so bound
[1:34:56] I remember sitting in a in a meeting and
[1:34:58] it was there was a there was a man
[1:35:02] sitting on the front row here and he was
[1:35:03] a good we through the whole meeting. The
[1:35:05] man had been there been coming and he
[1:35:07] was he was mentally
[1:35:13] he he he was a real nice fella. He was
[1:35:18] about 30 years old. He But he he was he
[1:35:23] he was just what you know I'm I'm I'm
[1:35:25] looking for a word mentally
[1:35:28] You're not allowed to say that these
[1:35:30] days but whatever the words is for that.
[1:35:32] Mentally challenged
[1:35:34] and and and there he was. Good boy. We
[1:35:38] we we had shaken his hand. He was a good
[1:35:40] guy. But he just just vig
[1:35:45] you say little words. He could say hi.
[1:35:48] He could say this.
[1:35:50] That night I was I was three I was two
[1:35:54] rows back from him.
[1:36:00] And while the preacher was preaching,
[1:36:03] that devil that had him bound
[1:36:06] started challenging the preacher.
[1:36:11] Now, I didn't notice it, but when you're
[1:36:12] when you're up there and you're up here
[1:36:14] preaching, you do see things. You do
[1:36:17] understand things. You do know where
[1:36:19] spirits are coming from. And
[1:36:22] and the man stood there. The preacher
[1:36:24] stopped
[1:36:26] and he pointed at the man that was just
[1:36:28] an overgrown boy. He pointed at him and
[1:36:31] he says, "You have challenged the living
[1:36:35] God."
[1:36:37] And we're all going
[1:36:39] poor kid, man. 30 something years old.
[1:36:46] And all of a sudden, that man,
[1:36:49] he got real nervous. And as he sit there
[1:36:52] just just mentally, not.
[1:36:56] And the preacher said, "Stand to your
[1:36:58] feet."
[1:37:00] And the man stood to his feet
[1:37:03] and he said, "Satan, you have poked your
[1:37:05] head up at the wrong time.
[1:37:08] You who have bound that this man and has
[1:37:12] kept him from living a normal life,
[1:37:15] I command you to come out of him in the
[1:37:18] name of Jesus."
[1:37:20] And that spirit threw that boy clean out
[1:37:23] over into here. And there he was just
[1:37:25] shaking and and then he was still
[1:37:31] talking about
[1:37:33] making the hair stand up on your head.
[1:37:39] There was just an holy all and we all
[1:37:42] begin to pray and just plead the blood
[1:37:45] and just calling unto God. And after a
[1:37:49] while, the boy, I call him a boy cuz he
[1:37:52] was just a little child in his mind.
[1:37:56] Oh, God.
[1:38:00] He put up his knees and he stood up for
[1:38:03] the first time.
[1:38:07] He looked around to his aged mama
[1:38:10] come and hugged her neck
[1:38:14] and talked like a regular man.
[1:38:19] I shook his hand.
[1:38:23] I shook his hand. God took his Are y'all
[1:38:28] understanding me? There's nothing too
[1:38:30] hard for God.
[1:38:37] There's nothing too hard for God. God
[1:38:40] can take your brokenness
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; and bring everything right into order.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Joe and Stephanie was here this morning
[1:38:51] as they're moving.
[1:38:55] Heroin addicts for 20 years.
[1:38:59] Brokenness.
[1:39:03] one touch from the Lord
[1:39:06] that it produced something in their
[1:39:08] lives.
[1:39:11] Oh, how we could go, couldn't we just go
[1:39:13] right here in this church and just talk
[1:39:14] about brokenness?
[1:39:16] Couldn't we just go through this church?
[1:39:19] Look at you, Tina. How God took your
[1:39:22] life out of all of your family. Took
[1:39:25] your life. Took you out of brokenness.
[1:39:30] that has made a masterpiece out of you.
[1:39:33] It's nothing but God's grace.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Look at you, Katrina.
[1:39:40] When I met you, you were broken.
[1:39:43] You were hurt.
[1:39:46] Your upbringing.
[1:39:50] You wouldn't be able to trust any human
[1:39:52] being.
[1:39:55] when you talked to me when you was just
[1:39:56] a girl, 14 years old, and the brokenness
[1:40:00] of your life.
[1:40:06] And look what God's done for you.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He come to give us peace
[1:40:15] so that we can believe his word. We have
[1:40:17] a right to believe those things. And
[1:40:19] then we look at here what God's done for
[1:40:21] Sister Katrina and how we we could never
[1:40:24] do without Sister Katrina here at the
[1:40:26] church. Don't even think about moving.
[1:40:30] brokenness,
[1:40:39] emptiness,
[1:40:42] formlessness,
[1:40:44] and yet love.
[1:40:49] Love brooding over your heart heart,
[1:40:51] your hard ground
[1:40:55] begin to melt. this minerals, this pot
[1:40:58] ash, and these things all coming
[1:41:00] together and up comes beauty out of your
[1:41:03] life.
[1:41:10] We could go on through there. Even you,
[1:41:11] Caleb, the beauty that God's brought out
[1:41:13] of your life and the things that he that
[1:41:16] he's done, all of the miracles and how
[1:41:18] that God
[1:41:20] brought you in.
[1:41:25] You, Denise,
[1:41:29] how many foster homes were you in?
[1:41:33] 23 foster homes. No one wanted her.
[1:41:38] There might have been a reason for some
[1:41:39] of them not wanting her.
[1:41:44] She come from brokenness.
[1:41:48] Her very own daddy was doing things to
[1:41:50] those kids and that that that that that
[1:41:53] kids should never even have to never
[1:41:55] have to worry about. The protecting
[1:41:58] wasn't there for her.
[1:42:01] She was broken.
[1:42:07] 20
[1:42:08] three
[1:42:10] foster homes.
[1:42:13] She was so rebellious as a teenager.
[1:42:18] Her rebellion she went out and got
[1:42:19] pregnant at a very early age.
[1:42:24] Broken brokenness continued even though
[1:42:26] she had a family. Brokenness continued.
[1:42:31] She lost her marriage.
[1:42:35] everything there
[1:42:38] so broken
[1:42:40] and he said I was not even able to shed
[1:42:42] a tear
[1:42:45] couldn't even cry
[1:42:50] but I believe you said it was one night
[1:42:52] in your in in in the hallway of your
[1:42:55] house
[1:43:02] couldn't go on any further she had to
[1:43:04] have peace.
[1:43:08] She had to have peace.
[1:43:11] And when she knelt down there in in that
[1:43:14] hall and said, "God, I need you." It was
[1:43:20] like rivers begin to flow out of her.
[1:43:23] And she wept and she wept and she wept
[1:43:26] as she accepted God's forgiveness and
[1:43:29] his peace. And it washed her and washed
[1:43:32] her and washed her.
[1:43:36] What would we do without Denise?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; She came in here to pony
[1:43:44] wanting the Holy Ghost,
[1:43:47] locked herself up
[1:43:50] and begin to pray and she said it just
[1:43:53] the Holy Ghost came upon her.
[1:43:58] What am I saying?
[1:44:03] God can still take
[1:44:05] chaos
[1:44:08] and make beauty.
[1:44:11] Should we talk about someone that we all
[1:44:14] know or most of us know and that's
[1:44:18] our sister
[1:44:20] Julie.
[1:44:24] Oh, Julie.
[1:44:26] She was rough on me owning that
[1:44:28] restaurant and she was rough on me. Oh,
[1:44:31] here's the preachers of the church of
[1:44:32] the skirt and here's this and here's
[1:44:34] that and she was just constantly
[1:44:40] she was open with about gays and she was
[1:44:44] open about oh my goodness and how God
[1:44:46] don't judge anything.
[1:44:49] One day
[1:44:52] I look out there and here comes Julie.
[1:44:58] Julie
[1:45:00] walking in and setting down.
[1:45:10] I I remember she she started coming
[1:45:12] occasionally to the services and then
[1:45:14] she be to come regularly and but Julie
[1:45:17] still needed God. She had been coming to
[1:45:20] church for a long time but she was still
[1:45:21] progay, pro- lesbian, pro pro whatever.
[1:45:24] She was pro sin, pro everything, man.
[1:45:28] And she was very vocal. One thing she
[1:45:30] wasn't pro and that wasn't that was men.
[1:45:32] She was not pro man. She hated men.
[1:45:43] Michael, you and I were in the were in
[1:45:45] the car that night. You and I were in
[1:45:47] the Carolas.
[1:45:50] We just came out of a meeting. Brother
[1:45:53] Hughes was with us.
[1:46:00] nearly calls me. She never would call me
[1:46:02] brother. It was always Wendle.
[1:46:07] She's on the phone and she said,
[1:46:08] "Wendle, where are you at? Why weren't
[1:46:10] you at church tonight?" Oh. And she is
[1:46:12] chewing me out.
[1:46:14] And I said, "Calm down. Calm down.
[1:46:16] What's going on, Wendle? Wendle, where
[1:46:18] wanted you to be here? Can Where are you
[1:46:20] at?" And I said, "It's okay, Julie.
[1:46:23] What's going on?" And I'm just trying to
[1:46:25] calm her down. And finally, once I get
[1:46:27] her settled down, she says, "I was in
[1:46:29] church tonight." And Jonathan was up
[1:46:31] there preaching. He was up there
[1:46:33] preaching about the blood of Jesus and
[1:46:36] how that he can take the vile sinner's
[1:46:39] heart. And while brother Jonathan was
[1:46:41] preaching, she says, "I don't
[1:46:43] understand. I don't know what happened.
[1:46:46] That's why I've got to call you." Amen.
[1:46:48] I don't know. But she says, "The ceiling
[1:46:51] opened up in that back row where I was
[1:46:53] at." And she said, "Water begin to come
[1:46:56] down over me and came up and washed over
[1:46:59] me and washed up and washed over me."
[1:47:02] And she's crying. And she says,
[1:47:04] "Wendall, I know that God has forgiven
[1:47:08] me."
[1:47:13] It was at that time
[1:47:16] he says, "You take every woman in that
[1:47:18] building,
[1:47:20] you take every person, you take everyone
[1:47:23] in that building
[1:47:26] and stack up all of their sins
[1:47:30] and it would not come near mine."
[1:47:34] He said, "I've had abortion after
[1:47:36] abortion.
[1:47:41] I've lived the vile unclean lives."
[1:47:47] And she began to tell me, "I've done
[1:47:50] this
[1:47:52] and I've done that."
[1:47:54] She said, "I'm not even worthy to be in
[1:47:56] that congregation with y'all.
[1:47:59] I'm a vile person.
[1:48:02] He said, "I've always stood out here and
[1:48:04] looked at y'all, and I've always looked,
[1:48:06] but I've thought, what can I do? Oh, I
[1:48:08] wish I could be like them, but I've
[1:48:10] messed my life up."
[1:48:14] She told me, she said, "But tonight,
[1:48:18] I know that I'm forgiven.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; All of my sins are forgiven."
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; When the
[1:48:29] I'm one of you now.
[1:48:32] I'm one of you now.
[1:48:35] And we all love Sister Julie until the
[1:48:37] time that she's died. Can you say amen?
[1:48:42] What is What am I saying? And I told you
[1:48:44] it's only going to be a few minutes.
[1:48:45] Sorry.
[1:48:48] What am I What am I ministering here
[1:48:50] tonight is there's one that can still
[1:48:52] say, "Peace be still."
[1:48:55] God took all of your sin. and he took
[1:48:57] all of your shame. He took all of your
[1:48:58] and he and he and he put it on the
[1:49:00] cross. Hebrews 2:14 says, "For as much
[1:49:04] then as the children are partakers of
[1:49:06] flesh and blood, he also himself took
[1:49:08] part of the same that through death he
[1:49:11] might destroy him that have the power of
[1:49:15] death, that is the devil, and deliver
[1:49:18] them who through fear of death were all
[1:49:22] their lifetime subject to bondage."
[1:49:24] Verily, he took not on the nature of
[1:49:26] angels, but he took on the seed of
[1:49:28] Abraham.
[1:49:30] Wherefore, in all things that behooved
[1:49:32] him to be made like unto his brethren,
[1:49:34] that he might be a merciful
[1:49:36] and faithful high priest, and things
[1:49:38] pertaining to God, to make
[1:49:40] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:49:42] people, Christ come to join us together.
[1:49:46] Revelations 1 and5. heaven from Jesus
[1:49:49] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[1:49:51] the first begotten of the dead, the
[1:49:52] prince of the kings of the earth.
[1:49:55] Unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:49:57] from our sins in his own blood
[1:50:01] and has made us kings and priests. Unto
[1:50:03] God and to his father to him be glory
[1:50:07] and dominion forever and ever.
[1:50:10] Acts 20 and 28
[1:50:13] he's given instruction to the apostles
[1:50:16] take heed or the elders of the church of
[1:50:19] Ephesus take heed therefore unto
[1:50:22] yourselves and to the over the flock
[1:50:23] over the which the holy the holy ghost
[1:50:26] has made you overseers to feed the
[1:50:28] church which he has purchased with his
[1:50:31] own blood
[1:50:36] peace
[1:50:38] Romans 5:9
[1:50:40] Much more than being now justified
[1:50:45] by his blood, we shall be saved from
[1:50:47] wrath
[1:50:49] through him.
[1:50:52] Ephesians 2:8. But now in Christ Jesus,
[1:50:55] ye who sometimes were a far off are made
[1:50:59] nigh by the blood
[1:51:01] of Christ.
[1:51:12] God's not brought you here
[1:51:16] just to be here. God's brought you here
[1:51:19] because God loves you.
[1:51:22] If you're hearing my preaching,
[1:51:31] I was talking to someone the other day,
[1:51:33] the other night
[1:51:35] as I was visiting, could feel the
[1:51:37] presence of God just coming down.
[1:51:43] And I made the statement. I said, "He's
[1:51:44] here.
[1:51:48] He's He's came three times.
[1:51:53] You feel his presence.
[1:51:57] That's the Holy Spirit letting you know
[1:52:00] that there is nothing impossible with
[1:52:02] God.
[1:52:09] And if we hear his presence, hear his
[1:52:11] voice here tonight through his servant.
[1:52:14] I'm his mouthpiece tonight.
[1:52:18] If we can hear his voice,
[1:52:21] not mine, but his
[1:52:26] peace,
[1:52:29] divine peace.
[1:52:33] Musicians would come
[1:53:05] Peace
[1:53:07] be
[1:53:10] wonderful
[1:53:15] coming down
[1:53:18] from the father
[1:53:21] above.

[1:53:28] my spirit
[1:53:32] forever.

[1:53:39] in fathom.
[1:53:52] Peace.

[1:54:40] this message for a

[1:54:50] I don't
[1:54:52] I know that
[1:55:00] we want to start here.
[1:55:05] You're not a Christian until you
[1:55:08] become part of the God grace.
[1:55:13] You're not a Christian until you have
[1:55:14] received that new birth
[1:55:21] and we won't.
[1:55:25] But many of times there are Christians
[1:55:29] and the devil has brought us into
[1:55:31] brokenness.
[1:55:37] And I want to say,
[1:55:42] you might be a Christian and
[1:55:45] and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:55:50] but you're needing peace in your heart.
[1:55:53] The one that gave it to you at the
[1:55:55] beginning can give you that peace again.
[1:56:03] He's the God of all peace.
[1:56:06] He's not the author of confusion.
[1:56:09] He's the author of
[1:56:14] While we sing this song tonight.
[1:56:19] If you've not given your heart to the
[1:56:20] Lord, don't wait one more night. I'm not
[1:56:22] talking about saying a prayer.
[1:56:25] I'm talking about coming and making sure
[1:56:28] that soul has found peace with God.
[1:56:32] You're never going to fix this up here.
[1:56:35] You're never going to fix anything
[1:56:40] until you fix this in here.
[1:56:45] That peace
[1:56:47] passes all understanding
[1:56:53] loss
[1:56:56] of love.

[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Then I remember
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; I'm standing on the rock.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; I'm standing on that rock Christ Jesus.
[2:28:15] So, if I were you,
[2:28:19] I'd turn around and give what to be

[2:28:25] You're bound to lose.
[2:28:30] Though, I just got to tell Satan

[2:29:38] [Music]
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; God sends preachers to preach the gospel
[2:29:42] of peace.
[2:29:45] This message is the message of peace.
[2:29:49] The prophet of God could preach the
[2:29:51] message shalom.
[2:29:54] It's nighttime, but shalom.
[2:29:59] The world is in chaos, but shalom.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; No matter where we are, what this life
[2:30:08] holds,
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; we're living under peace.
[2:30:14] Romans 10:15. How shall they preach
[2:30:16] except they be sent as it is written?
[2:30:18] How beautiful
[2:30:21] are the feet of them
[2:30:23] that preach the gospel of peace
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; and bring glad tidings of good things.
[2:30:31] Romans 15 and 13.
[2:30:34] Now the God of hope fill you with all
[2:30:38] joy and peace
[2:30:41] in believing that you may abound in hope
[2:30:45] through the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:30:49] 1 Thessalonians 5:23, the very God of
[2:30:52] peace sanctify you holy,
[2:30:56] and I pray God your whole spirit and
[2:30:59] soul and body be preserved blameless
[2:31:01] until the coming of our Lord Jesus
[2:31:03] Christ.
[2:31:06] 2 Thessalonians 3:16. And the Lord now
[2:31:10] the Lord of peace himself
[2:31:13] give you peace always
[2:31:17] by all means.
[2:31:21] The God, the Lord of peace himself
[2:31:26] give you peace always
[2:31:29] by all means.
[2:31:32] The Lord be with you.
[2:31:35] Peace.
[2:31:37] Aren't you glad for peace?
[2:31:40] Hallelujah.
[2:31:42] Praise the Lord.
[2:31:46] Hallelujah.
[2:31:48] Glory to God.
[2:31:50] Doesn't matter what where I'm at, what
[2:31:52] I'm facing. Doesn't matter where I'm at
[2:31:54] tomorrow.
[2:31:56] Satan, you're not going to take away
[2:31:57] from me what you have given me today.
[2:32:01] When you ever come before God and you
[2:32:04] find the realities of your soul, then
[2:32:06] you've got to drive a stake right there
[2:32:07] in the ground.
[2:32:09] Cuz Satan will come up to you tomorrow
[2:32:11] morning and say, "Oh, that was all a
[2:32:12] bunch of work up." Satan will come in
[2:32:15] and say, "Well, you didn't get
[2:32:16] anything." But you drive that stake
[2:32:18] today and say, "God has changed my life,
[2:32:20] and I'm not going to allow Satan to say
[2:32:22] anything different."
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; If you've received the baptism of the
[2:32:26] Holy Ghost, and you know you've received
[2:32:28] it, then don't let the devil talk you
[2:32:29] out of it.
[2:32:32] Hallelujah. If you come sincerely before
[2:32:35] God and you pour out your heart and you
[2:32:37] lay everything at the altar and you're
[2:32:40] believing God, then don't let the devil
[2:32:42] take anything away from you. Drive the
[2:32:45] stake in the ground right there where
[2:32:47] you are and say, "I am not going to give
[2:32:49] up an inch of ground that I have
[2:32:51] received tonight."
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:56] Amen.
[2:32:58] Amen.
[2:33:00] Hallelujah.
[2:33:03] Hallelujah. The God of all peace is
[2:33:05] right here.
[2:33:08] He's hovering over the building right
[2:33:09] now. He's hovering over you right now.
[2:33:12] Amen. Hallelujah. If you're still
[2:33:14] needing something from the Lord, then
[2:33:16] just reach out right now. He's still
[2:33:18] here. Amen.
[2:33:21] Hallelujah.
[2:33:23] Hallelujah.
[2:33:25] Praise the Lord.
[2:33:29] Hallelujah.
[2:33:31] Glory to God.

[2:37:29] Cover me when I am going
[2:37:32] through the stor.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; Cover me when I seeless.
[2:37:40] Cover me when my faith is gone.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Let the peace that passes all
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; understand.
[2:37:51] [Music]
[2:37:59] Amen.
[2:38:01] Amen.
[2:38:02] I'm thankful for that.
[2:38:06] In serving the Lord, we've got to always
[2:38:09] guard our heart.
[2:38:16] When you come to God of peace
[2:38:20] and the Lord comes and settles on our
[2:38:22] heart, then then there's a lots of times
[2:38:25] or most all of the time
[2:38:28] we've got to go home and we've got to
[2:38:30] choose
[2:38:32] those thoughts of peace
[2:38:35] because
[2:38:38] The battleground is right here in our
[2:38:40] mind. And Satan will fight and he'll try
[2:38:43] to do everything he can to take you,
[2:38:45] take that away. But I'm saying tonight
[2:38:48] when we go home,
[2:38:53] things that used to get under your crawl
[2:38:56] or, you know, the little the little burr
[2:38:59] under the saddle, say, "Lord,
[2:39:03] I'm going to walk with you.
[2:39:05] [Music]
[2:39:07] say try to maybe try to get something
[2:39:10] maybe your bills will come up and do
[2:39:12] anything to try no I'm going to walk
[2:39:15] with God because remember and every one
[2:39:18] of us I want us to remember this the
[2:39:21] Holy Spirit is very timid
[2:39:24] you know that the Bible says Jesus could
[2:39:26] do no great works
[2:39:28] in certain cities because of their
[2:39:30] unbelief
[2:39:32] one time because there was so much
[2:39:34] unbelief He had to take one man out of
[2:39:37] the town so that he could talk to him
[2:39:40] alone.
[2:39:42] God only walks, he can only fellowship
[2:39:46] with spirits
[2:39:47] that are soft and pliable before him.
[2:39:52] God's not going to bulldoze his way into
[2:39:54] our lives.
[2:39:56] And he don't want you bulldozing your
[2:39:58] way through life. He wants you to be
[2:40:01] soft. He wants you to be kind.
[2:40:05] He wants you to look and say, "God, lead
[2:40:08] me." He's You're the sheep.
[2:40:12] And he's that great. He's that great
[2:40:14] spirit. He's the dove that settles down
[2:40:17] upon this sheep. It's the anointing that
[2:40:20] we want. We want that dove resting on
[2:40:22] us. Amen.
[2:40:25] And so, as we leave tonight,
[2:40:31] I'm going to think on those things.
[2:40:33] whatsoever things are and you can uh uh
[2:40:37] you can just put that up there sister
[2:40:39] keys that Philippians 4:8
[2:40:43] 4:7 let's start with Philippians 4:7
[2:40:47] Hallelujah
[2:40:49] amen God gives us instruction and then
[2:40:51] we'll leave dismiss here and the peace
[2:40:55] of God that passes all understanding
[2:40:58] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[2:41:01] Christ Jesus
[2:41:03] Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things
[2:41:05] are true, whatsoever things are honest,
[2:41:09] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[2:41:11] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[2:41:13] lovely, whatsoever things are of a good
[2:41:17] report, if there be any virtue,
[2:41:20] if there be any praise,
[2:41:22] think on these things,
[2:41:26] these things which you have both learned
[2:41:28] and received and heard and seen in me
[2:41:33] do and the God of peace
[2:41:37] shall be with you.
[2:41:40] So I think that's good instruction for
[2:41:42] every one of us. I'm going to think on
[2:41:44] the promises of God. I'm going to
[2:41:47] believe that which is true. I'm going to
[2:41:49] believe that which is true about my
[2:41:51] spouse. I'm going to believe that which
[2:41:53] is true about the brothers and sisters
[2:41:55] in the church. I'm going to believe that
[2:41:57] which is true. I am going to think on
[2:41:59] these things here. This mind is not made
[2:42:02] to imagine other stuff. It was made to
[2:42:05] think on the things of God. Can I hear a
[2:42:08] great big amen?
[2:42:11] Hallelujah. God bless you.
[2:42:14] Amen.
[2:42:16] We again, we're so thankful for God's
[2:42:19] God's abundant
[2:42:21] mercy and grace here in our in our
[2:42:24] church. And uh we again we appreciate
[2:42:28] our brother uh Timothy and his family
[2:42:31] being here with us today. And we ask
[2:42:34] that God just blesses them.
[2:42:39] [Applause]
[2:42:41] We did not take up an offering for
[2:42:43] brother Timothy this morning and I I
[2:42:45] want to take up an offering tonight.
[2:42:48] those of you that would like to to to be
[2:42:51] a blessing to brother Timothy pastors a
[2:42:53] small church and and I know uh I know it
[2:42:57] would be a blessing to them this morning
[2:43:00] um
[2:43:02] I got distracted with uh sending off
[2:43:06] brother Joe and sister Stephanie and so
[2:43:10] but those who would like to give we want
[2:43:11] to give you that opportunity
[2:43:14] and while you're while you're preparing
[2:43:16] to give I also want to
[2:43:20] uh bring something to our attention and
[2:43:21] it's and it's this has happened
[2:43:23] frequently
[2:43:25] and that is children and cars
[2:43:29] and um
[2:43:32] we need these children to stay on the
[2:43:35] sidewalks.

[2:43:40] should not be behind these cars.
[2:43:43] And uh I'd encourage you mamas and

[2:44:02] And u I know we can get a little bit
[2:44:05] picky when you know and think you know
[2:44:08] people are picking on our kids. I guess
[2:44:10] it's normal. But listen,
[2:44:14] those kids need to be taught. And if
[2:44:17] they're going to go out and play on the
[2:44:18] grass, they can go right around. They
