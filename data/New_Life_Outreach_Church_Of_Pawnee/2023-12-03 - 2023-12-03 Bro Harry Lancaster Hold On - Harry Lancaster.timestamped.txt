[38:02] may all have your
[38:13] seats as is so often with my sermons it
[38:17] may take a little while for everyone to
[38:19] see the connection from the first verse
[38:20] as we start with but we're going to kind
[38:22] of build up and we'll see where where it
[38:25] goes but
[38:28] you
[38:29] know when we look back
[38:32] at at Israel in in the Old Testament
[38:35] Israel during the time of King Saul and
[38:38] and and King David was a land of almost
[38:41] constant
[38:43] turmoil it was surrounded by enemies and
[38:46] they were under constant threat um even
[38:49] after they would defeat the opposing
[38:52] Army it wouldn't be long until that same
[38:54] enemy was coming back to fight them
[38:57] again there was there was no lasting
[38:59] peace there was no lasting rest for them
[39:02] whether they were beating the amorites
[39:05] or the ammonites or the Philistines or
[39:07] take your pick of which one even if they
[39:11] won they were just waiting until the
[39:14] next time the enemy came
[39:17] back in 1st Samuel chapter
[39:20] 22 and verse
[39:23] two it says and everyone that was in
[39:25] distress and everyone that was in debt
[39:27] and everyone that was discontented
[39:29] gathered themselves unto him and he
[39:32] became a captain over them and there
[39:34] were with him about 400
[39:36] men now this was speaking about David
[39:38] while he was on the run from King Saul
[39:40] and it was during this time that his
[39:42] forces began to grow individuals that
[39:44] had been cast out of society for some
[39:47] reason gathered themselves to him um
[39:51] whether these
[39:52] were debtors or criminals or
[39:57] foreigners they sought him out to become
[39:59] part of his band and during this time
[40:03] his men began to become accomplished
[40:05] Warriors they weren't necessarily
[40:07] Warriors when they came some of them may
[40:10] have been some of them could have been
[40:11] mercenaries scriptures don't go into
[40:13] enough details for us to know that for
[40:15] sure one way or another but obviously if
[40:17] a lot of these men were debtors or
[40:19] different things these were not trained
[40:21] Warriors all of them they were simply
[40:24] seeing something in David that they
[40:26] wanted to to go after seeing something
[40:28] in David that they wanted to
[40:32] follow 1st
[40:34] Samuel chapter 17 in verse
[40:38] 1 now the Philistines gathered together
[40:40] their armies to battle and were gathered
[40:43] together at shoka which belongs to Judah
[40:46] and pitched between shoka and azaka in
[40:50] ephes Damon and then Saul and the men of
[40:52] Israel were gathered together and
[40:54] pitched by the valley of ela and set the
[40:56] battle in Array against the Philistines
[40:59] and the Philistines stood on a mountain
[41:01] one on the one side and Israel stood on
[41:02] a mountain on the other side and there
[41:04] was a valley between them and there went
[41:06] out a champion out of the camp of the
[41:08] Philistines named Goliath of gath whose
[41:11] height was six cubits and a
[41:13] span dropping down to verse
[41:16] 45 then said David to the Philistine
[41:18] thou comest to me with a sword and with
[41:20] a spear and with a shield but I come to
[41:23] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[41:25] the god of the army of Israel whom thou
[41:27] Hast defied this day will the Lord
[41:29] deliver thee into mine hands and I will
[41:31] smite thee and take thine head from thee
[41:34] and I will give the carcasses of the
[41:36] host of the Philistines this day unto
[41:38] the fowls of the air and to the wild
[41:40] beasts of the earth that all the Earth
[41:42] may know that there is a God in Israel
[41:44] and all this assembly shall know that
[41:46] the Lord saveth not with sword and spear
[41:48] for the battle is the Lord's and he will
[41:51] give you into our
[41:53] hands David inspired the men that came
[41:56] to him because of what he had
[41:59] done and even with what he had done even
[42:03] in his speech to Goliath as he's talking
[42:05] he's not saying oh because of me and my
[42:07] power we're going to overcome on he says
[42:11] it's not by sword it's not by Shield
[42:13] it's not by my strength of arms because
[42:16] the battle is the Lord's and so even
[42:20] though I'm facing this giant that is so
[42:22] much larger me than I can't take on I
[42:25] don't have to fear because the battle's
[42:28] the Lords I'm trusting in Him to be the
[42:29] one that does the fighting I'm trusting
[42:31] in Him to be the one that will take on
[42:33] the enemy yeah and then David has gone
[42:36] off and here all these men are coming to
[42:38] him that are I'm sure many of them were
[42:42] inspired because of what had happened
[42:43] with Goliath there were many that were
[42:45] inspired because of the other battles
[42:48] that David had gone into during his time
[42:50] fighting for King Saul but all these
[42:53] different things they were inspired in
[42:56] and there was something about David that
[42:57] they wanted to follow him and in
[43:01] following him they began
[43:04] to they began to manifest some of the
[43:08] same things that David had done because
[43:11] David was not the only one to kill a
[43:14] giant if we go into 2 Samuel chapter
[43:20] 21 ends verse
[43:25] 15
[43:26] moreover the Philistines had yet War
[43:29] again with Israel and David went down
[43:31] and his servants with him and fought
[43:34] against the Philistines and David waxed
[43:37] faint and ish benob which was of the
[43:40] sons of the Giants the weight of whose
[43:42] spear weighed 300 shekels of brass and
[43:44] weight he being girded with a new sword
[43:48] thought to have slain David but abashi
[43:51] the son of Zariah suckered him and
[43:52] smokee the Philistine and killed him
[43:55] then the men of David swear un him
[43:57] saying Thou shalt go no more out with us
[43:59] to battle that thou quench not the light
[44:01] of Israel and it came pass after this
[44:03] that there was again a battle with the
[44:04] Philistines at Gob then cachi The Hite
[44:09] slew saf which was of the sons of the
[44:11] giant there was again a battle in Gob
[44:14] with the Philistines where elhanan the
[44:16] son of JY orim a bethle slew the brother
[44:20] of Goliath the gitite the staff of whose
[44:23] spear was like a Weaver's beam and there
[44:26] was yet a battle in gath where was a man
[44:28] of great stature that had on every hand
[44:30] six fingers and on every foot six toes 4
[44:33] and 20 in number he also was born to the
[44:36] Giant and when he defied Israel Jonathan
[44:39] the son of shimya the brother of David
[44:41] slew him these four were born to the
[44:44] Giant in Gaff and fell by the hand of
[44:46] David and by the hand of his
[44:48] servants and so four more
[44:51] Men followed the model that they had
[44:54] seen in David they didn't overcome
[44:57] Giants because going into it going I'm
[45:00] this strong I'm this powerful but they
[45:02] followed the model that David had said
[45:04] going the battle is the
[45:06] Lord's now they were willing to go in
[45:09] and fight they didn't stand on the S
[45:11] sideline and go all right Lord hit him
[45:13] with the lightning bolt throw a giant
[45:15] meteor down and crush them do whatever
[45:17] they put themselves into the battlefield
[45:20] but they weren't going in thinking I'm
[45:22] such a mighty
[45:24] warrior I can take on this giant they
[45:27] weren't going in thinking that because
[45:29] I'm so powerful because I am such an
[45:34] amazing member of this fighting
[45:37] unit that I can take on the
[45:40] giant but they had had modeled before
[45:42] them the man who went the battle is the
[45:45] Lord's the battle is his to take
[45:48] on and so they went in so then these
[45:51] four other individuals could all stand
[45:53] up and say that like David they had
[45:56] slain one of the Giants that's right
[45:58] they had taken them down the same way
[46:00] that David had been able to take down
[46:02] Goliath these four men could now stand
[46:04] and go we've killed Giants as well we've
[46:07] slain this enemy that came
[46:12] in David's men had a reputation that was
[46:16] known throughout
[46:18] Israel during the time that that Absalon
[46:20] attempted to seize the throne the
[46:23] adviser hushai spoke to him about the
[46:27] Warriors in 2 Samuel chter
[46:30] 17 starting at verse
[46:32] 8 for said hushai thou knowest thy
[46:37] father and his men that they be Mighty
[46:40] Men and they be chafed in their minds as
[46:43] a bear robbed of her welps in the
[46:48] field I don't go around bears and even I
[46:51] know you don't get between the mother
[46:53] bear and her young that's right this is
[46:55] is as common a knowledge as you can
[46:58] get and this is how he's describing
[47:02] David's
[47:03] men they are now at such a point that
[47:06] it's like you've taken away the Cubs
[47:09] from a mother
[47:10] bear these are not going to be easy men
[47:14] to be around these are not going to be
[47:17] easy men to face in this
[47:20] moment and thy father is a man of war
[47:23] and will not Lodge with the people
[47:25] behold he is hid now in some pit or in
[47:27] some other place and it will come to
[47:29] pass when some of them be overthrown at
[47:31] the first that whosoever heareth it will
[47:33] say there is a Slaughter among the
[47:35] people that follow Absalom and he also
[47:38] that is Valiant whose heart is as the
[47:40] Heart of a Lion shall utterly melt for
[47:44] all Israel knoweth that thy father is a
[47:47] mighty man and that they which be with
[47:49] him are Valiant
[47:52] men he was making it clear that all of
[47:55] these Mighty Men had a reputation at
[47:58] this point they had been with David they
[48:00] had fought through things they had faced
[48:03] the enemy they had gone through all
[48:05] these different
[48:09] tests and they had come up from being
[48:12] men that weren't
[48:13] Warriors to now being respected as these
[48:16] are Valiant
[48:17] men these are warriors that can face the
[48:21] enemy these are warriors that you're not
[48:25] not sure that you want to face these are
[48:28] warriors that are being compared to some
[48:31] of the fiercest animals that are around
[48:33] and you're going do you really want to
[48:35] go up against these guys is this really
[48:38] the time to face them is this really the
[48:41] time to be up against
[48:48] them these Warriors had had come from
[48:54] being like I said basically the lowest
[48:57] in society the ones that have been
[48:59] Outcast the ones that had been set aside
[49:02] the ones that had been cast out for some
[49:06] reason and now they were some of the
[49:09] most respected men these were the men
[49:12] that stood by David through everything
[49:15] these were the men that stood by David
[49:17] while he was in the wilderness stood by
[49:19] David after he became king stood with
[49:22] him and killed Giants stood with him and
[49:25] faced battle after battle after
[49:33] battle how much
[49:35] more should
[49:37] we be striving to be in that type of
[49:41] place how much more should it be that
[49:45] when Satan tells one of his demons to
[49:48] come after
[49:50] you that they want to pause for a moment
[49:53] and
[49:54] go yeah yeah that that's Miguel do you
[49:57] know what happened to the last group
[49:58] that went after him do you know what he
[50:01] did in the last
[50:04] battle you remember the last time we
[50:06] sent somebody to brother Merl's
[50:09] house we never saw them again they never
[50:13] came back and now you're wanting me to
[50:18] go you know we've heard the people make
[50:22] the comment or in some ways almost make
[50:24] it as a joke
[50:26] comment
[50:27] that when we wake
[50:29] up hell should
[50:32] tremble because now we're back up we're
[50:35] back on the
[50:37] battlefield And yet when we look at the
[50:39] Old Testament that is exactly the model
[50:42] that was being set forth when you look
[50:44] at David's Mighty
[50:46] Warriors these were men that were feared
[50:49] that had come from being the lowest come
[50:52] from being the basest come from being
[50:55] the least
[50:57] respected to now being the men
[51:00] that people were in awe of that people
[51:04] would look at and
[51:07] wonder that people would look at and if
[51:10] you were the enemy would fear yeah these
[51:14] were not just common foot soldiers that
[51:17] were pawns being pushed around these
[51:19] were the elite that had proved
[51:22] themselves time and time again and had
[51:26] come from being someone that was
[51:28] inexperienced wielding a weapon to now
[51:32] being an expert with what they
[51:35] used this was now their tool of trade
[51:39] yeah this was the thing they were used
[51:41] to handling whether it was a sword
[51:43] whether it was a spear whether it was a
[51:44] club whether it was whatever weapon they
[51:46] may have been
[51:48] using they knew how to use it well yeah
[51:52] it was not a question about well what do
[51:56] I want to try to use today they knew
[51:58] which weapon they were going to grab
[52:00] when they went into
[52:01] battle they had the weapon that they
[52:04] were secure with they had the weapon
[52:06] that they understood that they had
[52:08] experience
[52:24] with I've got a little bit of a a
[52:27] lengthy quote here so just bear with
[52:31] me in why little Bethlehem in
[52:40] 1958 those Warriors that was with David
[52:42] stayed right by his
[52:46] side if a Philistine come up he had to
[52:49] fight whoever it was they were picked on
[52:51] every side poor David in his mind all
[52:54] confused he thought how can it be Lord
[52:57] you know leaders sometimes go through
[52:58] things that the congregation doesn't
[53:00] know they're going through when they
[53:02] think of promises God has made then why
[53:05] don't it come to pass they don't tell
[53:07] their congregation they don't tell the
[53:08] people they associate wish but there's
[53:10] many frustrations in the heart of a real
[53:13] leader David sitting there his his
[53:15] throat burning him it was in the middle
[53:17] of summer the Philistines was taking
[53:19] advantage of that split between David
[53:21] and Saul and Saul looking for David
[53:24] everywhere and the Philistines also and
[53:26] then the Philistines looking for the
[53:27] Israelites talk about a time of
[53:29] confusion just about like it is now
[53:32] David taking the Refuge in this little
[53:34] place in this little shelter everywhere
[53:36] he could get to the little strongholds
[53:38] that he could hold on to then he got up
[53:40] on the mountain on that hot middle of
[53:42] the summer when the heat was tremendous
[53:44] his throat parching frustrations and
[53:47] fears in his heart wondering oh God how
[53:49] could it be you poured that oil upon me
[53:52] not because I chose myself but you chose
[53:54] me why did you call me from hurting the
[53:56] Sheep out yonder and told me you give me
[54:00] this to serve your people and here
[54:02] you've got me between the fires
[54:04] everywhere that was going through his
[54:08] heart he sat on the hill and he looked
[54:10] down and there the Philistines has come
[54:12] in and garrisoned right in Bethlehem his
[54:15] little
[54:15] home then his little city was under
[54:18] government control of the enemy not only
[54:20] that but his own Father's House Jesse's
[54:22] house was under bondage to the
[54:24] Philistines there was his own Nation his
[54:26] own church against him here was the
[54:29] enemy he was fighting here is the church
[54:30] people he was fighting not because he
[54:32] wanted to but because he was forced to
[54:34] do
[54:35] it but David in his own mind was was
[54:38] flustrated I can imagine let's watch him
[54:40] a minute goes back out there and scks
[54:42] down looks down there and thinks my own
[54:44] beloved City Bethlehem look at it there
[54:47] there the great things of God has taken
[54:49] place where my father's father's
[54:51] father's father was born where my great
[54:53] great great great great grandmother
[54:55] Yonder uttered in her in the time of
[54:57] birth of Judah from whose tribe I'm from
[55:00] that the Yonder laid something
[55:02] Supernatural she uttered their place and
[55:04] there Joshua placed that son right in
[55:06] there and through there has come all
[55:08] these things in here it got to be I was
[55:10] a sheep here H her and you poured oil on
[55:12] my head you said I would be king I
[55:14] believe you then he goes and looks down
[55:17] there and thinks well Way Down Yonder in
[55:19] my little city where I was born that
[55:21] little group where I was with them good
[55:23] old days
[55:27] it would be better if the methodists
[55:28] looked back to their good old days when
[55:30] they're few and far between and little
[55:32] school houses out here in America
[55:33] falling under the power of God and
[55:35] throwing water in their face it would be
[55:37] better for you Baptists look back where
[55:38] you come from too and the rest of them
[55:40] you Pentecostals look back to where you
[55:41] come from that's
[55:44] right let me interject for just a minute
[55:47] might be better for us message people to
[55:49] look back where we come from
[55:52] occasionally sir In the Heat of the
[55:55] battle here David began to think oh I
[55:56] can remember them nights I laid out
[55:58] yonder on that Hillside I remember when
[56:00] I watched them Stars how they moved up
[56:02] yonder and how God talked to my little
[56:04] boy heart I can remember when I got sew
[56:06] in the spirit one day looking at the
[56:08] clouds and the Shady Green Pastures till
[56:09] I screamed out in the spirit and saying
[56:12] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[56:15] want I remember one time little old lion
[56:18] come up one morning and got one of my
[56:20] sheep and the spirit of God Came Upon me
[56:22] and I went out and grabbed him and cut
[56:23] him to pieces I remember remember that
[56:25] Deliverance oh I can remember that
[56:27] evening just before the sun went down a
[56:29] bear came in and got him and I killed
[56:30] him them great Deliverance I remember
[56:33] when I sang his Praises in my childhood
[56:35] when I hted my sheep oh God take me back
[56:38] to that place take me back to my first
[56:41] love and sometimes we think that but
[56:43] we're in the heat of the battle
[56:45] something has got to be done we were
[56:47] boys once we're grown up men now the
[56:49] fight is on I remember when the sawdust
[56:51] boiled up on the floor and the people
[56:53] screamed and shouted and you couldn't
[56:54] get around the place nowhere here for
[56:56] people but it's not that way today the
[56:58] battle is
[56:59] on oh it's not William brandom the
[57:01] little boy preacher anymore you got to
[57:03] produce something yes sir there's got to
[57:05] be something different the time is on
[57:07] the battle is on the heat is on the time
[57:09] to be delivered the people Everyone is
[57:11] found written in the book now the time
[57:12] has come
[57:14] yes David and all his frustrations
[57:17] walking back and forth and thinking oh
[57:19] this hot day oh it's so
[57:22] hot oh I wish I had a drink then his
[57:26] mind goes back to way down there by the
[57:28] gates of Bethlehem there was a well
[57:31] there was no water like that
[57:33] water you know Palestine has some bad
[57:35] water they have evil Waters they even to
[57:38] Blackwater fever and stuff in them and a
[57:40] lot of its alkaline water which would
[57:42] kill you but Bethlehem is the water seep
[57:45] of the province there's no water like
[57:48] Bethlehem had David used to think when I
[57:50] take my sheep and start out the morning
[57:52] I'd go by that old well and drink oh oh
[57:55] how cool and how sweet and how it
[57:56] quenched The Thirst and now his throat
[57:59] is going yet
[58:02] anointed oh if I only had a drink of
[58:05] water now his Warriors and he screamed
[58:08] out in his despair oh if someone would
[58:10] bring me a drink again from that Old
[58:12] Well Yonder in Bethlehem oh after
[58:15] dreaming of his childhood days and the
[58:17] victories and see him in the place where
[58:19] he's sitting here between the fire as
[58:20] you scream oh somebody could bring me
[58:22] water from
[58:23] Bethlehem
[58:25] now his Warriors could not interpret his
[58:27] thinking but brother they loved him with
[58:30] all that was in them the least of his
[58:32] desire was a command to them three of
[58:35] his Mighty Warriors pulled their swords
[58:37] slipped off from camp and cut their way
[58:39] 25 miles David in there going no doubt
[58:43] wondered where are they at what have
[58:45] they done where did they go did they
[58:47] know they're jeopardizing their life
[58:50] they're right in the jaws of death
[58:51] through a 25 mile line laying in Ambush
[58:54] everywhere
[58:55] the swords of flickering and the shields
[58:57] of blasting but their man their brother
[59:00] that they believed that would be king
[59:02] desire to
[59:04] drink oh brother I wonder if the
[59:06] Warriors today are willing to cut their
[59:08] way through formalisms doubts and
[59:10] unbelief to refresh in the presence of
[59:12] the Lord his desires the least of your
[59:15] desires if it's Africa India if it's
[59:18] through the street whatever it is the
[59:19] least of your desires Lord is my command
[59:22] death doesn't mean a thing to me
[59:24] popularity
[59:25] my what am I what will I be means
[59:27] nothing Lord is to fulfill your
[59:29] desires that's the Warriors that's
[59:31] standing by the side of him if they call
[59:33] me Holy Roller if my name is scandalized
[59:36] if they kick me in the streets that
[59:37] doesn't matter your desire is my command
[59:41] amen that's the real Soldier yes
[59:46] sir the Mighty Man of
[59:50] David his desire was their command when
[59:55] they heard their
[59:58] leader longing for a drink from the
[1:00:03] well I don't think that they went and
[1:00:05] called the committee and Drew straws to
[1:00:07] see who would be the one to
[1:00:11] go I think these three men looked at
[1:00:14] each
[1:00:15] other grabbed their
[1:00:18] weapons and a couple
[1:00:20] buckets maybe one bucket I don't know
[1:00:23] how many they took at least
[1:00:34] one and then those soldiers set
[1:00:39] out because their one thought their one
[1:00:45] purpose was to
[1:00:47] fill David's desire that's right if he
[1:00:51] wanted to drink from
[1:00:53] Bethlehem then they were going to get
[1:00:55] him a drink from Bethlehem or they were
[1:00:57] going to die
[1:01:01] trying
[1:01:04] right we can look
[1:01:07] through the pages in the scriptures and
[1:01:09] we can see this list of these Mighty
[1:01:11] Warriors of
[1:01:18] David is there a
[1:01:21] list in heaven that has your name listed
[1:01:24] this the same way to go
[1:01:27] these were the Mighty Warriors in
[1:01:31] leoa these were the Mighty Warriors that
[1:01:33] were willing to fight through every bit
[1:01:36] of Darkness through every Temptation
[1:01:39] every battle that came
[1:01:41] along because it was their Lord's
[1:01:44] desire that this be accomplished it was
[1:01:47] their Lord's desire that this happened
[1:01:49] it was their Lord's desire that this
[1:01:52] person be testified to it was their
[1:01:53] Lord's desire that this person be
[1:01:56] reached that this person be prayed for
[1:01:59] that this this
[1:02:05] this and we can
[1:02:08] just see the
[1:02:10] list like you can read through the
[1:02:12] entire thing in Samuel or in
[1:02:19] Chronicles and
[1:02:22] there's brother James Torrance
[1:02:26] one of
[1:02:29] the I don't know what the numbers are in
[1:02:32] the Old Testament was
[1:02:34] 30 I think we're probably a little more
[1:02:37] than
[1:02:38] 30 but one of the however
[1:02:42] many brother Mike King one of the how
[1:02:48] many sister Tina Martin one of the how
[1:02:53] many
[1:02:57] and maybe there are some that we're just
[1:02:59] listed as part it doesn't really go into
[1:03:03] exploits and then maybe there are a
[1:03:08] few that just like in the Scriptures it
[1:03:11] goes they were part of the three they
[1:03:14] were part of the this many because they
[1:03:18] stood up in this situation they faced
[1:03:21] this enemy they battled this this
[1:03:30] giant what did they do they fought their
[1:03:34] way through until they got to that well
[1:03:36] they dipped the bucket of water out and
[1:03:38] here they come back fighting cutting
[1:03:41] their way from right to left until they
[1:03:42] come into the presence of
[1:03:45] David said here you are my Lord oh my
[1:03:48] what a man that was disgraced a man that
[1:03:50] was hated by the church a man that was
[1:03:52] hated by the king the man that that was
[1:03:54] hated by the Philistines a man that was
[1:03:56] hated everywhere nearly but a little
[1:03:58] group that followed him they knew he was
[1:04:00] the coming
[1:04:01] King today I know you we sing great
[1:04:04] songs we build great churches we have
[1:04:06] great anthems and everything we praise
[1:04:08] to him like that but Jesus said in your
[1:04:11] hearts you are far from me for you teach
[1:04:13] for Doctrine the Commandments of Men Let
[1:04:16] the Holy Spirit come in and do something
[1:04:17] in the church showing the presence of
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ they'll kick you out the
[1:04:21] door in vain do you worship me they
[1:04:23] worship but in vain do you do it
[1:04:25] teaching for Doctrine the traditions of
[1:04:28] men but there's Warriors who believe him
[1:04:30] there's Warriors who stand by it with
[1:04:32] the spiritual understanding like in
[1:04:34] Little Bethlehem Yonder see sure it was
[1:04:38] David picks up this bucket of water he
[1:04:39] looked at it and the Bible said he
[1:04:42] poured it upon the ground said Lord be
[1:04:44] it far from me that I would drink
[1:04:46] that the Warriors jeopardize their life
[1:04:49] to go Yonder to bring this water to me
[1:04:51] it's the blood of men I cannot do it and
[1:04:54] this this Sweet Water they jeopardized
[1:04:55] their lives for and broke through the
[1:04:56] enemy line to go Yonder and get David
[1:04:59] poured it upon the ground as a free will
[1:05:01] offering to the
[1:05:07] Lord 1 Chronicles chap
[1:05:11] 11 and verse
[1:05:17] 12 and after him was Eleazar the son of
[1:05:20] Dodo the aite who was one of the three
[1:05:23] mighties
[1:05:25] he was with David at pdim and there the
[1:05:28] Philistines were gathered together to
[1:05:30] battle where was a parcel of ground full
[1:05:34] of barley and the people fled from
[1:05:36] before the Philistines and they set
[1:05:38] themselves in the midst of that parcel
[1:05:40] and delivered it and slew the
[1:05:41] Philistines and the Lord saved them by
[1:05:45] great
[1:05:47] Deliverance I don't know if any of you
[1:05:51] noticed back in 1 Samuel chap CH 17 and
[1:05:54] verse 1 that we
[1:05:56] read it says the Philistines were
[1:05:58] pitched between Shoku and azaka in ephes
[1:06:05] damim now ephes damim means the edge of
[1:06:10] blood when we go back to 1
[1:06:12] Chronicles 11 and verse 13 it says he
[1:06:16] was with David at
[1:06:21] pdim that is translated as the boundary
[1:06:25] of blood and it's understood by Scholars
[1:06:27] that even though two slightly different
[1:06:29] names are used there that it's the same
[1:06:33] place so this was a portion of land that
[1:06:37] the Philistines had come against before
[1:06:40] this was where David had fought against
[1:06:45] Goliath and now the Philistines had come
[1:06:50] back how many of you in your lives have
[1:06:52] a Battleground that the enemy seems to
[1:06:54] keep coming against and keep coming
[1:06:56] against because this
[1:06:58] is your border ground this is the weak
[1:07:03] spot in the defenses and they keep
[1:07:05] sending battle after battle after battle
[1:07:08] against that
[1:07:09] spot and your
[1:07:12] Battleground is not necessarily the same
[1:07:14] as your neighbor's Battleground right
[1:07:17] each one of us have the own battles in
[1:07:19] our lives but you'll quickly find that
[1:07:21] the enemy targets the same spots over
[1:07:23] and over
[1:07:25] because they can tell this is this is
[1:07:26] the weak area maybe we didn't win last
[1:07:28] time but we might break through this
[1:07:29] time maybe we didn't win last time or
[1:07:32] maybe we did win last time and then
[1:07:34] finally got driven away and so we're
[1:07:36] going to keep coming back to see if we
[1:07:37] can get back in there because we used to
[1:07:39] own it that used to be our territory
[1:07:42] that used to be our
[1:07:44] land and we keep fighting in the same
[1:07:47] territory the same place over and
[1:07:52] over
[1:07:54] but here you have
[1:07:56] Eleazar the son of Dodo the
[1:08:02] ahite and he was one of the three
[1:08:04] mighties he was the one that was num
[1:08:07] listed number
[1:08:09] two he was one of the most what was
[1:08:12] considered the most powerful of the
[1:08:16] Warriors and here he's gathered with
[1:08:21] David and it says that the people fled
[1:08:25] from before the
[1:08:27] Philistines and so it ends up being
[1:08:31] Eleazar and
[1:08:33] David that's
[1:08:35] it it's the two of them against the
[1:08:39] Philistine
[1:08:44] Army and they set themselves in the
[1:08:46] midst of the parcel and they delivered
[1:08:48] it and slew the
[1:08:50] Philistines and the Lord saved them by a
[1:08:53] great
[1:08:56] Deliverance let's go to 2 Samuel chap
[1:09:03] 23 and verse
[1:09:08] 9 and after him was Eleazar the son of
[1:09:11] Dodo the ahite one of the three mighty
[1:09:14] men with David when they defied the
[1:09:16] Philistines that were gathered together
[1:09:18] to battle and the men of Israel were
[1:09:21] gone
[1:09:22] away meaning
[1:09:24] they
[1:09:26] ran they didn't stick around the men of
[1:09:30] Israel
[1:09:32] fled he arose and smokee the Philistines
[1:09:36] until his hand was weary and his hand
[1:09:39] clave unto The Sword and the Lord
[1:09:41] wrought a great victory that day and the
[1:09:44] people returned after him only to
[1:09:50] spoil now there's no way to be sure
[1:09:53] whether whether these two scriptures are
[1:09:54] talking about two separate events or
[1:09:57] whether it's giving just slightly
[1:09:59] different descriptions of the same
[1:10:02] event don't know for sure Scholars will
[1:10:06] argue that until we're gone we can ask
[1:10:10] the Lord on the other side which one it
[1:10:12] was doesn't particularly matter a whole
[1:10:14] lot whether it was one event or whether
[1:10:18] it was two different events it's
[1:10:20] impressive either
[1:10:22] way
[1:10:26] in the description that we see in 2
[1:10:28] Samuel
[1:10:34] here when they defied the Phil defied
[1:10:37] the Philistines that were gathered
[1:10:38] together to battle and the men of Israel
[1:10:41] were gone
[1:10:42] away so elaz Eleazar was not a man that
[1:10:46] was
[1:10:48] timid even when the rest of Israel
[1:10:52] fled he was still bold enough to defy
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:56] Philistines he wasn't standing there
[1:10:59] quietly waiting for them to
[1:11:02] come he was taunting he was yelling he
[1:11:09] was asking them to come
[1:11:12] closer all the kind of things that you
[1:11:14] picture in your head of he is defying
[1:11:21] them then when they come here
[1:11:24] Rises and he begins to Smite the
[1:11:29] Philistines now there a couple things
[1:11:31] that that I find interesting about this
[1:11:33] first
[1:11:34] off it see see very quickly that his
[1:11:37] weapon of choice is the
[1:11:39] sword now being a part of David's Army
[1:11:43] there is no doubt that Eleazar was
[1:11:46] experienced with the sword this was not
[1:11:49] his first time ever grabbing
[1:11:52] it he had been with David for a while he
[1:11:55] was part of this Elite group this was
[1:11:58] not his first time ever picking up a
[1:12:00] sword it was something that he
[1:12:02] understood it was something that he had
[1:12:03] handled
[1:12:05] before more than likely it was a weapon
[1:12:07] that he had personally cared
[1:12:10] for normally in military units it's
[1:12:13] common that you care for your own weapon
[1:12:15] this is what you're assigned it's given
[1:12:18] to
[1:12:19] you and whether this was a weapon that
[1:12:21] had been issued to him or whether was
[1:12:23] one that he had brought
[1:12:25] himself he was the one who spent the
[1:12:28] time cleaning it he was the one who
[1:12:30] spent the time sharpening it he was the
[1:12:31] one who spent the time honing it he was
[1:12:33] the one who spent the time caring for it
[1:12:35] to make sure that it
[1:12:37] was ready for
[1:12:40] battle making sure that it wasn't
[1:12:42] sitting up on the wall rusting that it
[1:12:44] wasn't pitted or chipped or any of these
[1:12:47] kind of things it was cared
[1:12:49] for to be used and to be ready in battle
[1:12:54] yeah it was a weapon that he had
[1:12:56] experience with before he ever went out
[1:12:59] to battle he
[1:13:00] had practiced with it probably countless
[1:13:05] hours whether it
[1:13:08] was the idea of Shadow Boxing against
[1:13:11] imaginary opponents whether it was
[1:13:13] training with his fellow soldiers or
[1:13:15] whether it was in previous smaller
[1:13:17] skirmishes and battles he had used this
[1:13:20] weapon time and time again
[1:13:23] so he knew the weight of it he knew the
[1:13:27] heft of it he knew the balance he knew
[1:13:29] how much force he needed to use to swing
[1:13:32] it he knew what it could cut through and
[1:13:35] what he should avoid hitting because it
[1:13:37] probably couldn't cut through that he
[1:13:40] had used this weapon over and over and
[1:13:42] over to the point
[1:13:44] where you could all some people would
[1:13:47] say that it was like the extension of
[1:13:48] his arm type thing because he knew it so
[1:13:52] well
[1:13:54] for you electricians I'm sure there are
[1:13:56] certain tools that you've used so many
[1:13:58] times you don't even have to think about
[1:14:00] when you grab
[1:14:01] it brother William doing carpentry and
[1:14:04] different work I'm sure there are
[1:14:05] certain tools that he grabs that he just
[1:14:09] immediately there's no like testing the
[1:14:11] heft or anything when he grabs it he
[1:14:13] grabs it and goes to work because he's
[1:14:15] used it so many
[1:14:16] times there's certain tools that that
[1:14:19] he's used that many times there's
[1:14:21] certain tools that have been used in the
[1:14:23] bet trade and that's what this sword was
[1:14:26] to Eleazar this was a weapon that he
[1:14:27] knew there was no question there was no
[1:14:31] well let me let me test it for a minute
[1:14:32] before the enemy gets here he had gone
[1:14:35] through all that he knew how to use the
[1:14:41] weapon now
[1:14:43] generally when a person is in battle and
[1:14:47] begins to get
[1:14:50] weary normally the chances are they're
[1:14:53] grip begins to
[1:14:55] slacken when they begin to get tired
[1:14:57] they begin to to loosen up just a little
[1:14:59] bit and they're more likely to have the
[1:15:02] weapon slip out of the hand or twist
[1:15:04] unexpectedly or do different things to
[1:15:07] where they're not going to be as
[1:15:10] effective but yet what we find is in
[1:15:12] this battle that's not what
[1:15:16] happened it says he got
[1:15:21] weary but his hand clayed unto the
[1:15:24] sword now you could go
[1:15:27] into trying to give some sort of natural
[1:15:30] explanation he gripped it so hard his
[1:15:32] hand cramped around it to where he
[1:15:33] couldn't let it go you can go into a
[1:15:35] supernatural explanation going God put
[1:15:38] it there and it wasn't
[1:15:39] moving there's not enough in the
[1:15:41] scripture for me to go which way it was
[1:15:43] all I know is it didn't move it was in
[1:15:47] his hand it didn't come out whether you
[1:15:48] want to say it was natural or
[1:15:50] Supernatural I don't care it stayed
[1:15:53] right so you may as well call it
[1:15:55] Supernatural no matter whether it was
[1:15:57] natural or
[1:15:58] not cuz it did the opposite of what
[1:16:00] would normally
[1:16:02] happened it held on to him because it
[1:16:06] was there he couldn't he couldn't let go
[1:16:08] of it if he wanted to it was
[1:16:13] there but as much as he knew his weapon
[1:16:16] and cared for his weapon as much as he
[1:16:18] had experience with his
[1:16:21] weapon the scriptures are also still
[1:16:23] very
[1:16:24] clear about who brought the
[1:16:27] Victory and the Lord brought a great
[1:16:29] victory that day the victory came from
[1:16:32] the Lord the Lord chose to use Eleazar
[1:16:35] in that
[1:16:36] situation but elazar didn't walk away
[1:16:39] going I am such an amazing
[1:16:44] Warrior he walked away going God used
[1:16:48] me God used me in this battle God used
[1:16:52] me to to take on this enemy God used me
[1:16:55] to overcome
[1:17:00] here in the moments when I was weary in
[1:17:02] the moments where I was so tired that I
[1:17:05] should have dropped The
[1:17:07] Sword and the moments where my grip
[1:17:10] should have weakened and it should have
[1:17:13] Twisted on me to where I was just
[1:17:15] hitting the flat of the blade against
[1:17:17] people or it should have been knocked
[1:17:19] from my hand when somebody else swung
[1:17:21] against it in all those moments it was
[1:17:24] still
[1:17:25] there and it kept
[1:17:28] swinging and I kept taking the enemy
[1:17:37] on I think we all
[1:17:39] can think of brothers and sisters that
[1:17:42] we either know currently or that have
[1:17:46] gone on that you would go they held the
[1:17:48] sword till the
[1:17:49] end they never let it go they never Let
[1:17:53] It
[1:17:54] Drop they held it
[1:17:59] on you know brother D and sister Jalene
[1:18:02] are two that I would hold up as they've
[1:18:04] held the sword they haven't dropped it
[1:18:06] they haven't let it
[1:18:08] go they've held it right up till the end
[1:18:11] of the
[1:18:14] battle I
[1:18:16] watched other brothers and sisters that
[1:18:19] y'all have never met that I knew from
[1:18:21] from Florida
[1:18:23] or that I knew from
[1:18:25] Alabama that were Elders that they held
[1:18:29] the sword until the very end their
[1:18:32] testimony was never shaken they were
[1:18:33] never down whether they were fighting
[1:18:36] some sort of physical ailment whether
[1:18:38] they were fighting
[1:18:40] whatever they had the sword the whole
[1:18:42] way through and they would have the
[1:18:44] testimony that at the end it became to
[1:18:47] the point where they were not even
[1:18:48] really holding the sword the sword was
[1:18:50] holding them the sword was clear leaving
[1:18:53] to
[1:18:56] them we know that in Hebrews it talks
[1:18:59] about that the word of God is quick and
[1:19:02] powerful and sharper than a two-edged
[1:19:05] sword when we talk about
[1:19:09] Eleazar he had the sword that he used
[1:19:12] all the time he had the sword that he
[1:19:14] was experienced
[1:19:15] with it wasn't anything that he had a
[1:19:18] doubt about it wasn't anything that he
[1:19:19] had questions about it wasn't something
[1:19:22] that when he grabed it he struggled to
[1:19:24] know how should I hold it or what stance
[1:19:26] should I use
[1:19:32] or how many of us can go
[1:19:34] hey I have no struggle to find the
[1:19:37] scripture I'm looking for I have no
[1:19:38] struggle to
[1:19:39] find this quote or this scripture when I
[1:19:43] need
[1:19:47] it when we have a situation that comes
[1:19:49] up in our lives how many of us can go
[1:19:51] yes I've used this weapon so well well I
[1:19:53] know how to find what I need to face
[1:19:57] this I know it because I've used it so
[1:20:00] long I've been in it so
[1:20:03] long like what brother William was
[1:20:05] preaching about this morning that we
[1:20:07] have to be in the word for ourselves
[1:20:09] Beyond just hearing what The Minister's
[1:20:13] preaching but can we sit there and when
[1:20:15] he says a scripture without referencing
[1:20:18] it
[1:20:19] completely when he says a quote without
[1:20:22] necessar telling us exactly where it's
[1:20:25] from can we just sit there and not and
[1:20:27] go yeah that's right I I remember
[1:20:29] reading that before I've been
[1:20:32] there or are we sitting there going is
[1:20:35] that really what it
[1:20:36] says was that was that was that is that
[1:20:39] really in there I don't remember seeing
[1:20:41] that before that's that's new I've never
[1:20:43] heard
[1:20:45] that are we simply taking it all
[1:20:47] completely on face value going there is
[1:20:50] no way this Minister would ever say
[1:20:52] anything wrong
[1:20:53] so I don't need to look in that myself
[1:20:55] they've got it all we're
[1:21:00] good now I am going to be the first one
[1:21:02] to tell you I don't know everything in
[1:21:06] here I am not at the point I've heard so
[1:21:11] many people and I've watched it when
[1:21:13] brother Duran would have the strength to
[1:21:14] be up here ministering and he just
[1:21:16] starts rattling off scriptures and
[1:21:19] quotes and you can tell when he's saying
[1:21:22] it that he's not going
[1:21:24] close he's going exactly what it is
[1:21:28] there's no well brother brandom said
[1:21:30] something like it's brother brandom said
[1:21:32] DT D D D D DT
[1:21:34] do there's no saying well the Bible says
[1:21:37] something like it's the scripture says D
[1:21:40] DT DT D DT DT
[1:21:43] DT I'm not in that
[1:21:45] place I am not at the place where I can
[1:21:48] be like brother Duran and just rattle It
[1:21:51] Off I am not at the point where I am the
[1:21:55] expert with my
[1:21:57] weapon which means I need to can spend
[1:22:00] more time with it I need to spend more
[1:22:02] time in training I need to spend more
[1:22:05] time practicing I need to be spend more
[1:22:07] time wielding it to the point where it
[1:22:10] is second nature to the point where it
[1:22:13] is when the enem is coming in I don't
[1:22:15] have to struggle and go quick grab my
[1:22:17] computer and do a search is there a
[1:22:19] quote somewhere about this is is there a
[1:22:23] scripture that deals with this in some
[1:22:26] way it's no I know it's there because
[1:22:29] I've read it
[1:22:30] before I don't have to scramble and
[1:22:34] wonder is this weapon going to
[1:22:44] work when we spend the time in the word
[1:22:46] and become impregnated like brother
[1:22:48] William was talking
[1:22:50] about we have the experience where with
[1:22:52] our
[1:22:53] weapon we know how to use it we know how
[1:22:56] to handle it we know how to wield
[1:22:58] it we have faith in it because it's
[1:23:02] something we're experienced in we're not
[1:23:04] standing there with our sword wondering
[1:23:06] will this cut through the enemy's
[1:23:09] armor will this hold up till the enemy's
[1:23:12] blows against
[1:23:15] it when the enem is throwing things at
[1:23:17] us and
[1:23:20] saying you know that's just from a
[1:23:22] missile blowing up right that's just
[1:23:25] that's just smoke from
[1:23:28] there when those kind of things get
[1:23:30] thrown against
[1:23:32] us we're not standing there wondering is
[1:23:36] it going to hold
[1:23:38] up we're able to stand there with the
[1:23:40] confidence to go
[1:23:42] no that's seven angels yes
[1:23:47] sir there's no ifs ANS or butts even if
[1:23:52] you were were to show me supposed video
[1:23:55] evidence that it's a missile it doesn't
[1:23:58] change what I
[1:24:01] believe because I'm not standing on what
[1:24:04] you supposedly can prove or the fact
[1:24:06] that there are no articles about this
[1:24:08] many people falling off a bridge and
[1:24:12] drowning that brother brandom saw when
[1:24:14] he was a
[1:24:16] kid who
[1:24:21] cares do I
[1:24:23] need evidence for every single piece or
[1:24:27] can I trust in the weapon that I've been
[1:24:30] given come on can I trust in the word
[1:24:33] that I've been
[1:24:34] given when I can read through the
[1:24:37] message and everything brother brandom
[1:24:39] taught can tie back into the scripture
[1:24:42] yes sir why do I care if there's
[1:24:44] evidence about whether guys fell off a
[1:24:46] bridge or
[1:24:48] not it doesn't
[1:24:51] matter
[1:24:54] it'd be it'd be completely different if
[1:24:56] we could take what brother brandom
[1:24:57] taught and go well this doesn't quite
[1:24:59] line up something doesn't match now
[1:25:01] we're in a whole different conversation
[1:25:03] that's right but that's not what they
[1:25:04] ever bring anytime they come to get you
[1:25:07] to question your weapon it's trying to
[1:25:10] question well there's no evidence that
[1:25:12] this Vision was actually true there's no
[1:25:14] evidence that this happened there's no
[1:25:16] evidence of
[1:25:18] this yeah but every one of his sermons
[1:25:20] lines up yeah everything he taught lines
[1:25:24] up everything he taught
[1:25:27] matches with the
[1:25:31] scriptures which that's the evidence
[1:25:33] we're supposed to be looking at that's
[1:25:35] what we're supposed to be
[1:25:37] examining
[1:25:38] yeah was the word true or not do I have
[1:25:42] faith in my weapon or not have I handled
[1:25:45] my weapon
[1:25:46] enough to where I have no doubt on what
[1:25:49] it can take I have no doubt how it can
[1:25:52] go go against the enemy I have no doubt
[1:25:54] how it can be wielded in
[1:26:00] battle when we begin to come towards the
[1:26:04] end of our Earthly Journeys if the Lord
[1:26:07] terries and all of us continue to go
[1:26:09] along are we going to be ones that other
[1:26:12] people can look at and
[1:26:15] go you know they're like
[1:26:18] Eleazar the sword clung to them the
[1:26:22] sword clung to their hand there was
[1:26:23] never a chance they dropped it there was
[1:26:25] never a chance it
[1:26:26] slipped they held on to it the whole way
[1:26:29] through and ultimately it held on to
[1:26:34] them are we one of the mighty men
[1:26:38] that the
[1:26:40] enemy doesn't want to
[1:26:44] face are we one of the mighty men that
[1:26:47] hey we can go out and we can slay Giants
[1:26:49] when necessary we can face armies when
[1:26:52] necessary we can face the worst battle
[1:26:54] that comes
[1:26:57] along we can
[1:26:59] face bad medical
[1:27:03] diagnosis we can face oppression
[1:27:08] depression mental
[1:27:10] battles physical
[1:27:12] trauma emotional trauma take your pick
[1:27:15] of what it was the enemy would throw at
[1:27:18] you but yet you're able to stand there
[1:27:20] and go my weapon is strong strong
[1:27:26] enough and I've used my weapon enough to
[1:27:29] know I can trust it this wasn't
[1:27:31] something that I just got out of boot
[1:27:34] camp it was handed to me yesterday and
[1:27:37] I've never swung at at anything before
[1:27:40] it looks pretty that's all I
[1:27:43] know or is this a weapon that you have
[1:27:46] sharpened you have honed you have oiled
[1:27:49] you
[1:27:50] have worked with
[1:27:53] over and over and
[1:27:56] over the Mighty Men weren't men that
[1:27:59] just came straight out of boot camp that
[1:28:00] had joined a little while ago these
[1:28:02] weren't men that had a lack of
[1:28:05] experience these were men that knew
[1:28:07] their
[1:28:08] weapon the men that
[1:28:11] would fight for David to go all the way
[1:28:13] to get that
[1:28:15] water were not men that had joined the
[1:28:18] army that
[1:28:19] morning and we're like yes great we can
[1:28:22] prove ourselves in this these were
[1:28:24] seasoned Warriors that knew David loved
[1:28:28] David and as soon as David said he
[1:28:31] wanted it that was now their
[1:28:39] job that's the point where all of us are
[1:28:41] supposed to
[1:28:42] be moving towards if we're not there
[1:28:45] already we're supposed to be at the
[1:28:47] point where if this is what our Lord
[1:28:49] wants done then we're doing it
[1:28:54] if this is what's supposed to
[1:28:56] happen then it's going to happen or I'm
[1:28:58] going to die trying
[1:29:00] yes this is the weapon I'm going to use
[1:29:03] to fight for it because I have faith in
[1:29:06] my
[1:29:07] weapon I have faith in the word I have
[1:29:09] trust in the word because it's been put
[1:29:11] to the test multiple
[1:29:14] times this isn't a brand new blade
[1:29:17] that's never seen combat this is
[1:29:18] something that has been through the
[1:29:22] trials and I've discovered that it holds
[1:29:29] up brother Merl you've been through a
[1:29:31] few
[1:29:34] trials has the word held up the whole
[1:29:36] way
[1:29:40] through brother Joey you faced a few
[1:29:42] things you've come out of a few
[1:29:45] things has the word held up the whole
[1:29:47] way
[1:29:49] through sister jene
[1:29:52] I know the word's held up for you every
[1:29:55] step of the
[1:29:57] way and each one of us is supposed to
[1:30:00] have that
[1:30:01] testimony brother Ken I know I've heard
[1:30:04] from you multiple
[1:30:05] times how the word is held up for
[1:30:10] you as you fa different situations as
[1:30:12] you fa different tests in life and God
[1:30:14] was still there to provide God was still
[1:30:16] there to
[1:30:17] protect God was still there to watch out
[1:30:19] for you each step of the way
[1:30:23] each of us are at different stages in
[1:30:25] our
[1:30:28] journey I still consider I still feel
[1:30:31] like I'm on the younger side of my
[1:30:32] journey I haven't gone that far yet I've
[1:30:35] still got a lot of testing to do with my
[1:30:36] weapon it feels
[1:30:39] like then I realize I'm a little farther
[1:30:41] along than I feel like but still not
[1:30:43] that
[1:30:46] far we've got some of these young men on
[1:30:48] the front young women on the front that
[1:30:51] their weapons are still pretty new
[1:30:53] they're still learning how to wield them
[1:30:54] they're still learning how to use
[1:30:58] them they're learning how much they can
[1:31:00] actually trust
[1:31:05] it but ultimately we're supposed to be
[1:31:07] at that
[1:31:11] point where we have
[1:31:14] complete
[1:31:16] faith in the word that God gave us
[1:31:20] am where there is no
[1:31:22] question there
[1:31:24] is no
[1:31:27] doubt we know that this is God's
[1:31:32] word and that's
[1:31:47] enough brother brandom says in the
[1:31:49] sermon how can I
[1:31:50] overcome
[1:31:52] he says Jesus told us how to do it he
[1:31:56] overcome overcome means to stand the
[1:31:58] test that's right like all the old
[1:32:01] Saints did like Jesus did amidst all of
[1:32:04] his enemies he stood the test everything
[1:32:06] he was tested against he stood it in the
[1:32:08] very face of sickness and him being
[1:32:10] Messiah he healed them in the face of
[1:32:12] death he brought it back to life in the
[1:32:14] face of Calvary his own death he
[1:32:16] defeated it by surrendering himself why
[1:32:19] by the word said you destroy this temp
[1:32:21] Temple and I'll raise it up in 3 days
[1:32:23] the word said so see and in the presence
[1:32:25] of death he defeated it he overcame
[1:32:29] death in the presence of hell he
[1:32:31] defeated hell and overcome hell yes in
[1:32:33] the presence of the Grave he overcame
[1:32:35] the grave why all by the word and
[1:32:38] humility oh my there's the real man
[1:32:40] there's the one to make your example see
[1:32:42] he defeated everything overcome
[1:32:50] it
[1:32:55] Eleazar was a
[1:32:57] man who was fighting for his
[1:33:01] King he was a man who was fighting the
[1:33:03] enemy to defend his
[1:33:07] Nation he was a man that was willing to
[1:33:09] face whatever the enemy threw at him he
[1:33:12] was willing to stand up basically alone
[1:33:15] and defy the
[1:33:16] enemy he was willing to fight on by
[1:33:20] himself
[1:33:22] he was willing to fight on through the
[1:33:23] weariness through the tiredness through
[1:33:26] his body wanting to give
[1:33:32] out and in the
[1:33:36] end he was willing to confess as much as
[1:33:39] everyone and the Lord brought a great
[1:33:45] Victory the Mighty Men of
[1:33:50] David were
[1:33:52] not some modern day superhero that's
[1:33:55] trying to get a big name for
[1:33:58] themselves in a world now
[1:34:01] where everyone is fascinated by
[1:34:06] superheroes it's such a big thing but
[1:34:09] then when you actually go through
[1:34:10] history you find out it's not really
[1:34:12] that different they used to have all the
[1:34:14] stories in mythology that talked about
[1:34:17] they're part Gods part
[1:34:19] humans you had all these different
[1:34:21] things where they would go hey we can be
[1:34:23] more we can be something
[1:34:25] amazing and ultimately they were all
[1:34:27] simply aspiring to try to
[1:34:31] be what God Said that we
[1:34:35] are Christ said ye are
[1:34:38] Gods the word said you are
[1:34:41] Gods we're made in the likeness of
[1:34:49] God as the world stries
[1:34:52] and desires for that Superhero that's
[1:34:54] able to do all
[1:34:55] this we can look back in the scriptures
[1:34:58] and
[1:34:59] go those were the superheroes those were
[1:35:03] some of
[1:35:04] them and they weren't going hey look at
[1:35:07] me it's because of
[1:35:10] me they were
[1:35:12] going that's our King we fight for
[1:35:15] him that's our God he gives us the
[1:35:19] victory we're not trying trying to make
[1:35:21] a name for
[1:35:24] ourselves and when we look at it we're
[1:35:26] not trying to make a name for ourselves
[1:35:29] we're not going and trying to
[1:35:32] be this is all about Harry Lancaster to
[1:35:35] build my own platform so that I can be a
[1:35:38] traveling minister or get my own church
[1:35:41] somewhere or do this or do
[1:35:44] that who
[1:35:50] cares
[1:35:53] there's a reason that brother
[1:35:54] brandham would look at us and say I call
[1:35:57] you bride I call you Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:36:01] because everything we do is pointing
[1:36:03] back to Christ everything is pointing
[1:36:07] back to him we're not trying to build
[1:36:11] our own platforms or our own names we're
[1:36:13] going this is
[1:36:15] Christ did someone get healed it was
[1:36:20] Christ did someone get freed from a
[1:36:23] devil it was
[1:36:25] Christ this may have been the person
[1:36:28] that was
[1:36:29] used in this situation Eleazar was used
[1:36:33] he was the body that was chosen to be
[1:36:36] there at that
[1:36:39] moment there have been times when
[1:36:42] brother William was the body that was
[1:36:43] chosen to be there at that moment to
[1:36:46] pray for somebody or to talk to
[1:36:49] somebody or to be there through a
[1:36:52] situation and it wasn't so that brother
[1:36:55] William could get a big name or big
[1:37:00] platform he was simply the vessel that
[1:37:02] was chosen to be there at that
[1:37:05] moment and it doesn't have to be a
[1:37:08] minister there are times when brother
[1:37:10] Mitch was the vessel that was chosen or
[1:37:13] brother Ken or brother
[1:37:15] Mike or brother Michael brother
[1:37:20] Donald
[1:37:22] Sister Mary sister
[1:37:26] Brianna they were the vessel chosen at
[1:37:29] that moment there were vessel chosen for
[1:37:31] that
[1:37:33] situation but they weren't chosen so
[1:37:35] that their name could be anything
[1:37:36] special that's
[1:37:40] right and the Lord wrought a great
[1:37:43] Victory on that
[1:37:45] day that's what all of it goes back to
[1:37:49] that's what it all goes to is
[1:37:52] maybe I was the vessel that was
[1:37:54] there
[1:37:57] great but it was the Lord that wrought
[1:38:00] the victory it was the Lord that broke
[1:38:02] the change it was the Lord that healed
[1:38:04] the sick it was the Lord that set the
[1:38:06] captive
[1:38:09] free it wasn't brother Harry it wasn't
[1:38:13] brother Wendell brother Josh brother
[1:38:17] William Brother Daryl
[1:38:20] brother
[1:38:21] pick whatever minister's name you want
[1:38:23] to put in
[1:38:27] there it was Christ that wrought the
[1:38:30] victory
[1:38:36] amen Hebrews 12 and verse
[1:38:39] 1 wherefore seeing we are also compassed
[1:38:42] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:38:44] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:38:46] sin which does so easily beset us and
[1:38:49] let us run with patience the race that
[1:38:52] is set before
[1:38:54] us elzar had to hold on to his
[1:38:58] weapon he had to hold it
[1:39:03] tightly there are times when we have to
[1:39:05] keep running with patience we have to
[1:39:07] keep holding
[1:39:08] on there are times when we have to keep
[1:39:11] pushing through and keep holding on
[1:39:14] whether it's figuratively we're holding
[1:39:16] on as we keep going whether it's
[1:39:18] literally you're holding on to the
[1:39:20] object like he was with the
[1:39:35] sword First Timothy chapter 6 verse
[1:39:38] 11 but thou oh man of God flee these
[1:39:41] things and follow after righteousness
[1:39:44] godliness Faith love patience meekness
[1:39:47] fight the good fight of Faith lay hold
[1:39:51] on eternal
[1:39:53] life hold
[1:39:55] on where unto Thou Art also called and
[1:39:59] has has professed a good profession
[1:40:00] before many
[1:40:03] witnesses Matthew
[1:40:05] 24 verse
[1:40:08] 12 and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:40:11] love of many shall wax
[1:40:13] cold but he that shall endure into the
[1:40:16] end hold
[1:40:19] on the same shall be
[1:40:22] saved let's have the musicians go ahead
[1:40:24] and
[1:40:28] come 2 Timothy chapter
[1:40:30] 4 and verse
[1:40:34] 7 I have fought a good fight I have
[1:40:37] finished my course I have kept the faith
[1:40:42] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:40:43] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[1:40:45] the righteous judge shall give me at
[1:40:47] that day and not to me only but to them
[1:40:51] also that love his
[1:40:56] appearing I have fought a good
[1:40:58] fight I have finished my
[1:41:01] course I have kept the faith I held on I
[1:41:06] didn't let go of my
[1:41:08] weapon and ultimately as much as we
[1:41:12] might say that we're holding on to
[1:41:15] it in the end it turns out that it's
[1:41:18] holding on to
[1:41:19] us
[1:41:22] that's why I say I don't care in the
[1:41:24] story of Eleazar whether you want to say
[1:41:26] that it's a natural thing his hand
[1:41:29] cramped so hard that it was like a vice
[1:41:31] holding on to it couldn't let go or
[1:41:34] whether you want to say it was
[1:41:35] Supernatural that God made that sword
[1:41:38] hold on to
[1:41:39] him where he couldn't let it go if he
[1:41:42] wanted
[1:41:44] to but ultimately that's where we are in
[1:41:48] life we hold on to the best of our
[1:41:50] ability
[1:41:52] but then ultimately it comes down to him
[1:41:55] holding on to
[1:41:56] us we hold on to our weapon we fight the
[1:41:59] best we
[1:42:01] can but there's time after time through
[1:42:03] our lives when it turns around and it's
[1:42:06] Christ holding us because we couldn't
[1:42:09] have the strength to hold on to it
[1:42:11] anymore the weariness is too much we
[1:42:13] can't physically hold on to
[1:42:17] it we go past the point of human
[1:42:20] endurance of human strength of human
[1:42:24] capability and then the supernatural
[1:42:26] kicks
[1:42:28] in and you find out that it's his hand
[1:42:30] holding
[1:42:32] you that the weapon is cleaving to your
[1:42:37] hand and though you may be
[1:42:40] exhausted you can't drop
[1:42:42] it cuz you've gone past the
[1:42:45] point where you can't turn away
[1:42:48] anymore there's never a question in your
[1:42:51] mind to go you're like the disciples
[1:42:53] that said Lord where would we
[1:42:55] go what would we
[1:43:00] do there's nothing else I can go to
[1:43:04] there's nothing else I would
[1:43:13] take it comes
[1:43:16] down yes we're supposed to hold
[1:43:19] on yes we're supposed to to be able to
[1:43:21] trust our weapon and hold on to
[1:43:25] it but then part of that trust is we
[1:43:27] also trust to know that he holds on to
[1:43:29] us when we're going through the trials
[1:43:32] in life when we're going through the
[1:43:34] struggles when we're going through the
[1:43:35] hard times when we're going through our
[1:43:37] own mistakes and shortcomings and
[1:43:40] failures and the times when we would
[1:43:43] have let
[1:43:45] go because we messed
[1:43:49] up
[1:43:51] and then we find out that he's holding
[1:43:54] on to us through it
[1:43:55] all and he's only going to let us go so
[1:43:58] far before he starts pulling us
[1:44:02] back he's only going to let us fall so
[1:44:04] far before he grabs us goes no that's
[1:44:08] far
[1:44:10] enough let's get you back where you're
[1:44:12] supposed to
[1:44:13] be let's get you back in the fighting
[1:44:16] line let's get you back on the list of
[1:44:18] Mighty
[1:44:19] Warriors because that's what you
[1:44:22] are you know when we go through that
[1:44:24] list of Mighty Warriors we don't see it
[1:44:26] talk about all of their failures and
[1:44:29] shortcomings it doesn't talk about all
[1:44:31] the times that they messed up in
[1:44:33] training it doesn't talk about all the
[1:44:34] times
[1:44:36] they didn't care for their sword quite
[1:44:39] right and maybe it got chipped or maybe
[1:44:41] something happened or this that or the
[1:44:42] other or the times maybe they missed an
[1:44:46] order or did something like
[1:44:49] that what we see is at the end of the
[1:44:51] story where they're going now these were
[1:44:53] the Mighty Warriors and this is what
[1:44:54] they
[1:44:55] [Music]

[1:45:02] field and fought off the whole enemy
