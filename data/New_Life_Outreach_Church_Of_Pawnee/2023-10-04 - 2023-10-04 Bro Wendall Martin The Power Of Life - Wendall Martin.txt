while they were gone and they play such a big a part of the service important part and so we we sure missed them and but it's good to see everyone here in the house of the Lord here this evening on this Wednesday night we uh it's raining on the outside and and we just want it to rain on the inside amen uh no leaks in the roof we just we just want Holy Ghost Train uh here on the inside tonight and and wasn't it just a wonderful surprise celebration for our our sister Denise last night amen we uh we sure appreciate everyone that is so selfless and and to come and and to let our sister know that that you love her and and I tell you what we do love you sister Denise thank God for you and what a wonderful evening it was last night praise the Lord and uh I'm I'm glad to know I have friends and um man I you know when someone does something special for me I can just relive those relive those memories um they'll last a long time how many can attest to that amen and uh and so we're we we appreciate that let's look here um for a second Timothy the first chapter and um we've you know sort of been dealing a little bit with the Holy Ghost and um and so we're just going to continue a little bit on the in importance and the the life of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost is the very life of God coming and living within us and um we uh as we look here this evening want to sort of uh just just uh take a few moments and and um and and and show the very the power of this life now uh here in second uh Timothy 1 and 1 and and we're just going to read there and then we're going to skip down to the ninth verse it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus then we want to go on down to the ninth verse who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which he has given us in Christ Jesus before the world began now he's saying that he saved us and called us with a holy calling amen it says according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but has now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who has abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel now I also want to look here in and read one scripture here in Romans 8 and 11. laughs Romans 8 and the 11th verse is a very familiar passage of scripture here but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you amen I want to speak tonight on the power of life we thank you for your love today thank you for these wonderful songs of worship thank you for the anointing of your holy spirit that we feel tonight and we're just asking Lord that you would Minister to us and Lord as we come here this evening maybe we're a little tired maybe we're feeling sickly Lord I pray that the Holy Spirit would just come real special that the anointing of God would just settle down upon every one Lord that is present and those that that can't be here tonight I pray Lord that you would be with them and heal them and comfort them Lord but Lord as we're here tonight we're asking that the life of the Holy Spirit would be here in a real special way and that you would minister to our hearts Lord as we yield ourselves to you father we love you with all of our soul in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening amen the power of life is what I want to to speak on for a few moments this evening I begin to think a little as um man uh someone had had texted me earlier uh today and and had asked about you know what is what is the uh why do we worship on Sunday instead of on Saturday on the Sabbath and and as I begin to explain a little bit uh and and share that amount of the Old Testament Sabbath was a type of the New Testament rest in the Holy Ghost and and and going through those things I I begin to you know just sort of uh uh look back on the uh or on the law of Moses and actually the law of Moses is amen it can be divided up although Christ did not divide it uh or or Moses and when God gave it to Moses he did not divide it up into three sections but amen it can be divided up into the ceremonial law the judicial law and the moral law there man this is where God was was coming down and his whole purpose was was trying to reveal himself to the people and and to um and and at the same time to bring sin to the Forefront the sinful nature to the Forefront so that they could see that in trying to live the law of God they in themselves could not live the law and thereby they would see themselves as failures they would see themselves as Sinners they would see themselves without any kind of ability to be holy to be righteous to be that one with God and so amen the you had the amen the ceremonial laws there was the uh it had to do with the priesthood and the sacrifices that amen uh for for sin and uncleanness their ceremonies of holy days and feast days and and and and all of these things all represented these were all types of what God was going to do through Jesus Christ so as as I was as I was sharing with our sister today amen the the uh the Sabbath was simply a part of that ceremonial law amen and and but and though it gave you physical rest and that you were to rest on that seventh day amen there was no rest for this there was no rest for the soul there there there was nothing there because the soul was under the task master of sin and death it was under the as under the the the Taskmaster of Satan and though you could rest on that on that uh uh uh you know Saturday and it was to be a day of rest for you but it was also to be holy unto the Lord you were not allowed to work on that certain day you were not allowed to do certain things and it was to be a a day of worship but when the Holy Spirit comes Christ came to give us our rest Jesus says come unto me all you that are weary and that are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me and I will give you rest for your souls and so we we can see that now there were also if you we were to just look at the seven feasts amen uh I just real quickly there there was there in in Leviticus the 23rd chapter it goes through the Passover amen and the Passover was a feast that that was to uh remember the last plague that hit the Egyptians hit in Egypt and so when the death angel was to uh pass over those who had the blood over the the the the doorpost or over the little and also on the door post and and so Israel real was to slay a lamb they were to take hyssop amen a big bunch of hyssop which were weeds in their hands they were to reach down and and and dip dip it in the blood and they were to apply it over the doorpost and then they were to apply it on each side of the door amen so it was to be on the lentil and on each side of the post and you see it was a type of Christ Our lamb amen that was to come John the Baptist says Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world so we find that when today when the death angel is striking the blood of the Passover Lamb keeps a death Eternal death away from the believer can you say man amen there was also the second Feast it was the Feast of the unleavened bread amen this was a seven day Feast that's done started on the day following the Passover and this was a type of the seven Church ages and so that that this would be amen uh that they were you know to uh take this bread and haste and that they would not have uh a time to to for the yeast to rise and so uh uh uh uh they were to eat it and bake it and haste and they were to eat it in haste right along with their lamb and and so it was also a a type of Amen no sin the amen no no yeast in the bread no no sin in in your life to keep those things out so you've got to be pure and honest with yourself I believe there in first or First Corinthians five and seven it says Purge out those uh perch out there for the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and in truth Jesus says that he is that bread from Heaven Can you say Amen so so we find that the unleavened bread that was a type of Christ so I want you to catch the point here everyone everything of the Old Testament were types of Jesus coming in the New Testament amen he was that Passover so we don't have to keep the Passover anymore because Christ is our Passover Lamb we don't have to do uh keep the Feast of unleavened bread amen because now it's a heart of Purity and sincerity before God Amen now the third Feast was the the Feast of first fruits and this this year was one of uh uh three Jewish uh uh uh uh fall or harvest Feast that was intended to give honor to God and I want you to catch this because amen now I want you to now catch this because in the 14th day of not sin this was the this was the first day of the feast this was when they would kill the Passover Lamb amen then the second day would come amen it it would be the 15th day of Nisan and this was the Passover of which the death angel was to would pass over and then the 16th day which is the third day amen would be the celebration of the first fruits now I want you to really catch this here tonight because you look at Jesus now well first of all let me just tell you what the first fruits were amen it was the one the first fruits was the one to raise up the first it was the one that had matured and come into maturity and and it was plucked up and waved over the people and so amen so it was Jesus was was killed on on the exact same day did you know that Jesus was killed on that 14th day of Nisan he was in the grave he was in Hell carrying away the sins your sins Amen to back to Satan and on the day of firstfruits Amen this was the 17th day of nice or the 16th day of Nisan Jesus rose from the grave as the firstfruits of all of the Old Testament Saints amen now that's just beautiful Jesus fulfilled every one of those types of the Old Testament amen he was God's Feast he is God's Feast he is God Amen that come and fulfill took your place paid your punishment so that you could have eternal life now then of course we've got the uh the Feast of Pentecost and that's what I want to deal with for a few moments tonight we also have the Feast of the trumpets and you've got the the day of atonement and you've got the Feast of the Tabernacles and of course amen uh just just real quickly the day of atonement amen they were to take they were to take a bull and then they were to take a goat and they would slay the bull and the goat and then they would take they would take another gold and this goat was would would take it would call it was called the scapegoat and it would take the the sins of the people as they slayed the one goat they would allow and let the other goat and go free and they would uh they would actually drive them drive that goat from the congregation and they would drive it away long ways away it was and it was a type that cried Christ fulfilled Christ died but Christ also he was our scapegoat he carried our sins mine and yours not just out into the Wilderness to die a miserable death alone with no water and no food but he took our sins all the way to hell he took our sins he was our scapegoat oh Hallelujah aren't you glad for that see Christ carried our sins so that you and I could go free amen now the Feast of the Tabernacles if you look at the Feast of the Tabernacles it was it was a celebration that followed the day of atonement at where people would come out of their homes and they would live seven days in in a temporary structures amen they'd come out and live in tents for seven days and and this was this was a a commemoration of of of what God brought them out of in the in the Tabernacle or or in the in the wilderness for 40 years and and how that they just you know uh uh uh they were just vagabonds they didn't have homes they lived they lived in tents they didn't which was a type this was seven days talking about the church amen or the world actually Humanity going on for almost seven years of of uh uh of of of of no permanent place a man to where you uh uh you you you you you're born and you die you these Tabernacles right here we've been on the earth for six thousand years we we're going to go in the millennial Reign for another a thousand years which is seven days but it was a type that after the Feast of the Tabernacles we would go to our permanent dwelling place no longer living in these tents no longer living in these bodies that were going to Decay but we would be living eternally in a body that'll never die that'll never perish anymore where there is no sin where there is no amen pulling us one way or the other we will be eternally with God can you say Amen isn't that just incredible how that how that God is uh how the Lord was so accurate when he uh these These Old Testament uh types were so accurate with what God is doing in this this day until we can figure amen uh just with with a hundred percent accuracy what God has done now like all these other Jewish feasts that I've just mentioned the the Feast of the Tabernacle or the Feast of Pentecost is is an important one because it foreshadows the Messiah amen it for Shadows Christ's coming but it also Shadows the life of God coming to the church now and and I just want to to uh just just share a few moments not going to keep you long here tonight but you see each one of these are very important because they are foretelling of what Jesus Christ would do in the Plan of Redemption now once again Jesus is crucified as the Passover Lamb did he rose from the grave at the Feast of the uh first fruits now the exact same day that they had celebrated all of that time he raised from the dead on the Feast of the first fruits and then after he was on Earth for 40 days the scripture says he was on Earth on 40 days amen amen and then he told his disciples as he was ascending he says I want you to go to a Jerusalem so they went to Jerusalem and 10 days later the Holy Ghost came it was poured out now what is Pentecost Pentecost simply means 50. amen that's what Pentecost is is 50. so from the so from the date now this is this is this is the way they've done it in the Old Testament from the from the day that of the atonement from that day on 50 50 days later would be the day of Pentecost it would be the Feast of Pentecost and when we find out that when Christ had raised for up from the dead 50 days later here come the power of the Holy Ghost that isn't that just to me that's just wonderful to see how accurate God was doing and how that J Jesus fulfilled Those Old Testament prophecies can you say amen amen so so now I want you to look here for a moment as we as we think about the Feast of Pentecost now we know that the other Feast that they had they it was to be of unleavened bread and that sin uh the the the the leaven represented sin it also though Jesus says it was the doctrine of the Pharisees he says and you've got to get rid of the doctrine of the Pharisees amen if you're going to walk with me the Pharisees Doctrine is the leaven and it leavens the whole a little bit of Leaven and it affects the whole lump but yeah in the day on on the Feast of Pentecost they were required to take the to take the firstfruits to take that which had come first combine it together knead it together with leaven and they were to make two loaves of leavened bread now this was the this was what they had to do at Pentecost now there's a lot of theologians and I've I I've looked I I've I've done a lot of studying on it to find out what the why the leavened bread a lot of theologians want to say that well the leavened bread simply means that that that Christ Christ's body was going to be a sinful body Christ was going to live in a sinful body you and me you you and I are sinful and he's going to live in us but I just I I sort of have a hard time uh with with that I believe and I I and and and I as as we look into these things here amen I believe that it is the life of God within the church living his life and affecting the whole church now I think we can prove that here in scripture here this evening as we as as we look at this because I'm not too sure and I I you know asked I've I've actually when you when you look at these things here and and um uh I've you know checking with other ministers well what do you all thinking and uh uh I you know I I as I was talking to brother Tim prit and um uh he he had he he had really brought some light on on on this on this life that the Holy Spirit was the life of God coming in that there are good leaven and there is bad leaven there is 11 that will puff you up into in into uh a sin and Malice and hatred but the Holy Spirit can come in and and and give that life to you amen and bring life to the power of God within your life can you say amen and Sue we as as I'm as I begin to look amen I I want us to to look remember the Pharisees Doctrine was was called caused by a yeast that was a wild yeast it was it was amen that doctrine that uh uh that was you know brought sin but Christ's life into the church is creating a man raising us up into a Rapture raising us up into a higher Faith raising us up to believe God's word and not to doubt God's word but to believe God's word amen now now when the power of the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost What did the what did uh uh Peter say these are not drunk as you suppose but these are filled with that new wine now amen now when the Holy Ghost came it was called Nuance it was not called grape juice it was not called Hallelujah and we don't use grape juice when we come we use wine why because it is symbolic of the Holy Ghost the power of Life grape juice has no life in it there's no fermenting power to it but wine has the fermenting power can you say amen amen now now what makes wine have its keeping power what makes wine amen have the stimulation of Revelation what is it it is the effect of the yeast that is inside that wine that makes the difference and I want to tell you it is the life within the word that brings the stimulation to pass well glory to God in other words it's not a dead tradition Jesus says that the letter killeth but the spirit gives life he says my words are spirit and life well praise the Lord and when the yeast Life of Christ amen which is the holy spirit comes into that word it creates power it creates stimulation it creates an anointing yeah you can raise your head back up you're fine and I'm still in the Bible hallelujah amen it creates the anointing of God to come back and we can stand there and say ha I've got an anointing upon me Hallelujah now what did Jesus say they're in in now I'm not going to hold you along tonight so I'm going to really I've got a lot to say but I I just I'm going to try to just bring it in here real quickly Jesus made clear that the Holy Ghost was going to do what the Bible says that out of your bellies shall flow Hallelujah Rivers of Living Water Living Water hey what now I want you now I want you to look there there in John 7 and 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water and this fake key of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive John 4 and 14. whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a well of water Hallelujah bringing up bubbling up into everlasting life now I want you to catch this now everything all of these other feasts that I've just mentioned these other feasts were pointing to Christ Christ this one is pointing to the life of the Holy Spirit within the bread within you within me what does the two loaves represent amen are the prophet taught us at the two loaves represent the Gentile and the Jew what what has taken place the Holy Spirit within us giving life to us making us well he's no longer just the bread of life you become the bread of life because the words that you're receiving from him is not just a man falling on deaf ears it is now coming through the life of the Holy Spirit pulsating oh that's the reason why we don't ever want we should never just listen to the message or just read a a messenger just read the Bible we should always be praying God make sure the life is there to make it to live can you say Amen now amen this new wine these are not drunk and brother Brennan would say now the old intellectual the intellectual the old lady they gave her a facelift and she's still the same old woman the old man they gave him a facelift he's just the same old man I'll turn a new page on news years and I'll I'll start new life I'll throw away my pipe and then pick it up the next day that's just you it's it it it it isn't a facelift it's a birth that the church needs you can't preach this in the old church she won't stand it Jesus said in Luke about the fifth chapter about the uh wine in about the wine in in the bottles he said you can't put new wine in Old bottles or they'll perish and actually what he is brother Branham is referring to is Matthew 9 and 17. it says neither do men put new wine into Old bottles else the bottles break the wine runeth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and are preserved now brother Brandon would go on he would say that used to wander me that used to startle my boyish mind when I when I used to think and how the bottle would perish now what we call Glass amen what we call Glass being old it's it it makes no difference because it's glass but in Jesus time he was speaking of the bottle that they used then which was made out of animal hide and when it was new and young it just it had just been tanned it was flexible and when it got old it got dry now many of you people know how what hide uh what a hide is when it gets dry it gets old and dry and shrunk up and real hard now you put new wine into that it hasn't got any life in it it's going to burst it's just like trying to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the real genuine power of the resurrection and trying to place that before the people and when you do what happens in if you put it in the new one has got life the new one is still fermenting there's your yeast amen I never knew that they used it that you would call yes I guess sister Leo would know amen but they called the fermenting power of wine yeast it's the leaven of that wine now he says all the new wine is still fermenting I hope you see it the new life is fermenting the new wine is still fermenting and if it's in a new flexible bottle where the oil of the animal is still in the skin when the new wine goes to pushing out the skin will stretch otherwise when the Bible said Jesus is the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever the new skin will say amen and we'll stretch with it and when the new one said that the uh that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm the life of God that's working in you and the new skin will say amen and we'll stretch out to it when the new wine says the Holy Ghost is sufficient for our healing today the new wine will will say will stretch itself out the wine being the word and when it when it says that the new bottle will say amen and stretch out to it see but what will the old bottle do days of Miracles has passed and is gone uh what what what are we doing what are we accomplishing he said the old bottle will perish and the wine will perish with it it's almost like casting your Pearls Before Swine you try you turn and it under and you you do you see it Jesus doesn't anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it to return back to him void but he expects you to receive the word and in receiving the word be ready take that old cowhide that that's been living over there in the formal condition and swap it for a sheepskin that's flexible to the word of God and everything the Bible says you'll say Amen can I hear an amen but it must come from the Bible for the new wine only ferments wine it's only that it only verifies the elements that's in there the yeast only presses Force the bulb of the alcohol which makes it a bursting profession as the yeast bursts its little bubble to make it more perfect gives it a better taste to give it a better substantial holding it it it to make it more stronger to make it where it can't sour amen can you say Amen to that you see it is it is God taking you and me and putting his life within us on the day of Pentecost now it was on the day of Pentecost for all of those hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years that they would take the two loaves of bread and it had to be it had to be a leftened bread and wave it before the Lord on Pentecost it was on the day of Pentecost 50 days after Jesus is raised from the dead on the day of Pentecost is when the Jew and the Gentile begin to receive of the life of God it was then that the cloven tongues of fire come upon the Believers so Jesus wasn't talking about a sin being in the church at all he's talking about the life of God the atonement had been made Hallelujah Jesus had been raised from the dead and now God's very life has come to make you the bread of eternal life well that's glorious amen now now what is this what is this yeast amen it says the yeast munches on both the fructose and the sucrose then it expels the alcohol along with CO2 the same happens with the sourdough it is it is a yeast that munches on the fructose and the sucrose in the dough and makes the CO2 gas that makes the bread rise yeast is actually a life a living substance that is put into the grape juice or the dough that changes it can you say amen I I just I love that definition so what did God do to make new wine what did God do he put his very own life into his church making them oh praise the Lord now it was new bottles now we we understand that that brother Branham taught us that there has to be a new spirit to receive the new the new birth so there had to be God taking every one of us and and putting a new spirit within us to receive his Spirit within us that's actually there in the book of Jeremiah amen I'll give them a new spirit and then I will put my spirit within them so God has to take us and he hang up we can't even get along with ourselves half the time amen you and I can't get along with ourselves or each other lots of times praise the Lord amen but you see when the Holy Spirit comes and creates that something within a heart that is longing for God that is loving God that is one Hallelujah what he's doing he's taking the Stony heart out and he's given you a heart of Flesh so that you can receive the things of God that's the reason why you children when when you come and your heart is longing after God and and you wonder well well you know maybe some some of you might think well I'll never receive the holy ghost or maybe God don't want to give me the Holy Ghost the God wouldn't give you that little special something in your heart that's so tender that says I want you I want your life I want to oh I want your Holy Spirit God put that in your heart he created that there for you then you take that into that upper room so you see the 120 they didn't have to go into that upper room but when Jesus left as he's ascending he's saying I want you to go to Jerusalem and stay there until you be endued with power from on high you're gonna have some water coming out of the belly you're gonna have Rivers bubbling up it's not just going to be me I'm leaving but I'm sending the Holy Spirit back and the Very life that made me who I am is going to make you who you're going to be oh Hallelujah so what happens we find that the that the yeast the Holy Spirit coming down upon us and it makes it fermented and there's something that begins to Crave for more of God can you say man hallelujah amen it says it can only be put in the new Pentecostal bottles got out 120 of them gathered in the upper room after he had oiled him by his word and it softened up and had renewed and got the old Orthodoxy out of them and all of the old system and God had 120 bottles laying in the upper room with their necks up and a funnel on top and the Holy Spirit began to raise and these bottles got so alive until they begin to run outside preaching the gospel bouncing from place to place one jumped on a stump and said this is that right back with the word this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel then it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I'll pour out my spirit my new wine in my new body he says what a Revival that they were having that's God's order here comes a couple of bottles bursting by and they're laid an inflicted man and when this afflicted man touched the hand of one of these why his Affliction left him and he got he got some of it and began to leaping and praising God and running into the temple shouting and glorifying God that's God's order not a big school with a degree but a living acting experience of the Holy Spirit now not fanaticism but the real genuine Holy Ghost put into action you may see it may you see it is my prayer can you say Amen so this this leaven you can have the old leaven the the 11 of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Pharisee now again Jesus says the 11 was the doctrine well if it's the doctrine of the Pharisees and it was a wild yeast how much more is the doctrine of the Bible a living yeast where the Holy Spirit can come in anoint his word in you Oh Glory now 11 it'll it'll cause malice and friction and can you say Amen but the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost fell on the uh uh in cornelius's house amen and there they were this when it was coming to the Gentiles and and and and and and and and the Bible says that Peter had got up and began to declare amen the words of God and what had happened and exalt Jesus Christ all of a sudden the life of God came out of the eternals and entered into the Cornelius and all of those that dwelt among them and they become so full of the power of eternal life that they begin to speak in tongues now now there was not there was not Jews all around like before where they were hearing everyone in their own language amen this was just that personal private language that they had between them and God they were speaking in that what took place it was the very life of God that was energizing their mortal bodies I think here tonight amen this waving I believe there is a waving that has taken place in this last day it's a waving and I believe this waving is not just amen a little of ingredient of of of yesterday's grain but I believe God's got some loaves of bread here tonight I believe God's got some loaves of bread some people that have experienced the power of that yeast the power of that eternal life the it changes you it makes you like what it does if you you become a you've become a representative of that life that is within you well glory to God it's no wonder we can speak in new tongues it's no wonder amen that we can believe in miracles that's no wonder sometimes well the word of the Lord is being preached we just get so excited and stimulated within our souls what is it it's that life it's not a dead letter but it's a living letter that is within you Hallelujah now you couldn't just offer grain in this feast amen the leaven was to take the whole lump it would leaven the whole thing the doe and the leaven would be so intertwined Hallelujah Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life that song I'm falling head over heels in love with Jesus that you're so in and out it's all over you and God are all one can you say amen amen until you become you become bad you're baptized into this body with Christ it's no longer just a little piece of grain here and a piece of grain here and you know this one's sitting on the front row and this one's sitting on the second row and amen but now we're all in there we've been baptized into one body well praise the Lord First Corinthians 10 and 16 the cup of blessing which we bless is not is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are what one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that what one bread God calling us all together feeling is with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we become the first fruits with this message this message and this last day amen is once brother Brandon preach the message amen the rising of the sun he says once again there's going to be a wave offering what were they waving they were to wave those loaves of bread before the Lord saying that life has come back life is in the church life the power oh not a dead format but the life of God not just a dead letter but there's something in me that's quickening me to believe quickening me to accept quickening me to stand up and say I believe that it is all possible it can't do it when you're just one of those old you know cranky uh you know you know Believers that's had your experience way back 50 years ago and anything that you can see that that's nuts that's not up to what you think the prophet says then all of a sudden you're just all you're just all got your underwear in a wad amen no it is the power of the Holy Spirit living his life brother don't let me get so don't let me get so like this Amen to where the power of God through me come on church amen God's wanting somebody that is Holy Spirit can live through you know what that's why the Holy Spirit can follow on you young people amen sometimes more than this old guys that's been around a long time amen I've been serving the lord since I was 12 years old and I'm 53 so do the math and sometimes the Lord it takes a little bit for the Lord to touch me you know why amen because my old skin my old hide gets dry and I I sometimes God needs to move us whole hides and oil our hides of so that we can stretch again well come on now we can we can stretch amen but you hold you you young people are young let the Holy Spirit live in you that's the reason why I love the youth camps someone says well aren't you afraid that you know brother Wendell there's a little bit too much Wildfire at the Youth Camp you know amen and I'm I I you know what if they're in the flesh and what if they're this amen I say God let them have an experience with you that's not to say that some of it's carnal that's not to say that some of it is just you know uh uh you know just uh uh uh what am I looking for you know just following somebody else mimicking somebody else but I want to tell you what God done to me when I was a kid amen when the power of the Holy Ghost hit me it was not just somebody sitting on a Pew and and and and and and me not knowing when the Holy Spirit touched my life I want you young people I don't want y'all to hear me amen when the Holy Spirit touched my life it done something to me there was his word become alive I it was an anchor to my heart I look there uh when we uh here a couple years ago and and some of those who uh you know kids they were y'all remember when the Holy Ghost hit and there were people laying on the outside and the inside and and uh and and some of our kids were there and were just so touched by the Holy Ghost and and I and when I when it when I seen it hit I was thinking oh Lord I got to tell you my first my first thing I think that was the first time that was the that was the first time we met the fairweathers and uh I I was thinking oh Lord that's all we need is is is is is this gets a room around the country you know acting like a bunch of Pentecostals you know and and then I began to notice that night when I got back into the room I was in the dorms with the boys and and I noticed that there were some of those guys that were laying out that were still laying out in the in in that were still out underneath the presence of God and and and the other boys amen were throwing shoes on him and Adam and socks and everything else and those guys weren't budget they were still they they still they remember one of them was just Steve was just like he was totally out he was just laying there and uh the other one had a hands up in the air and he was speaking in tongues and I I you know and we're and I'm looking through here and I said well we'll we'll see I'm here to tell you these guys even after the the lights were out the presence of God was still on these people now now I am so fat so faithful that there's some yeah yards well-oiled hides that the Holy Spirit can fall on and just because I've received the Holy Ghost all those many years ago and maybe maybe I don't need to seek it now I should be seeking for a refilling I should be sick we should all be sick how many wants a refilling of the Holy Ghost but for you that need the Holy Ghost don't look at me or somebody else and say well I'm afraid of what no no no if you need the Holy Ghost and you've got a softness in your spirit that is longing more for God I say jump up there don't listen all of us old hides are behind all of you young hides all of us old hides we're we're right there with you we're believing we we want you to receive the same life that God has done for us Hallelujah I can't dance like I used to dance I can't shout like I used to shout I'm afraid I'll break a leg or something but I'm here to tell you I've still got something bubbling on the inside of me that's saying oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes and you're never going to hear me amen or I pray that I don't get so crusty amen that I that I I I can't even allow the preacher to preach amen without me getting critical at him my goodness let the god preach and let me understand what wow this holy spirit is trying to speak Hallelujah Holy Ghost Holy Ghost for the power the life this is not this is not a makeup what happened and I'm closing what happened on the day of Pentecost was what had been they had been doing in ritual form for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and then Here Comes Jesus They Crucified him on the very day that they killed the lamb Jesus rose on the very day that they were offering the first fruits 50 days later the Holy Ghost falls on the day of Pentecost this is not fake are you also y'all catching it and the genuine holy ghost that filled them that made them speak with tongues amen and prophesy and may the power of God so real on Earth until when they walked the next uh the third chapter of Max they walk into the temple and there's a there's a crippled man I'm just touching the crippled man makes the crippled man to get up and walk and then he starts screaming and shouting and jumping Hallelujah and got kicked out of the temple amen right that same living yeast coming in you it's living it's the thing that makes wine what it is it's the Living God on the inside of you it's real this is real and that's the whole thing for Redemption that's what God was wanting to do that's what his plan was he was the lamb then you become the first fruits of all of the Old Testament Saints and when he rose they rose with him as a type 50 days later God's presenting two loaves of bread Jew and Gentile was now going to be an expression it was no longer just Michael the son of Gonzalez now it was going to be Michael the Son of God it was no longer going to be William the son of Smith it was now going oh hey can you see man now in the rising of the Sun amen my brother Branham talked about and he's and he's talking about the wave offering but he stops to make it a little bit more understanding for us all he's talking about that wave off he says okay let's look at two Cadillacs he says if you've got two Cadillacs and he says they've got they've got leather seats no skin seats and they've got and and they've got the simonized job whatever that is uh you you might know brother Ken I don't know what a simonized job is amen you've got you and he says and you've got that hubcaps all polished you've got the gas and he says now the gas can be a thousand octane he said that can be the word that can be the word he says the guess is the word he said so you've got this one with the word and this one with the word he says but if there's no spark of life one will stay sitting and the other woman down the road what brand new both of them brand new both of them coming off the showroom floor both of them coming off the assembly like both of them there but one has no Spark and the spark is what is required to make the gasoline Hallelujah can you say man so when you got when you've got the word word word word word like we receive every week the word is good is blocking you cold dry formal dead and you can't believe God for the supernatural you might have another kind of yeast come on you might have another kind of yeast because the Bible's because Paul says it makes you puffed up that's right so what we want is not to be puffed up I know what the prophets had do you really where's the spark amen and that's what we want I want the spark I like that word make that word ha and Buddy wants that spark it's what is the spark it's like it's divine revelation when he goes ding ha that's who I am that's what I am Satan you can't have me Satan I rebuke you Satan I'm standing here upon the word of God I am a son and daughter of God can you say man Hallelujah oh yes so what was what was Pentecost Pentecost was the fullness of Christ that raised up that Old Testament Church Pentecost was the fullness of Christ that raised it up amen it quickened them brought them up together is that right amen hallelujah what is the Pentecost today it's the fullness of Christ that raised up the New Testament Church on the day of Pentecost the one that raised up Christ from the dead raised Those Old Testament Saints up and now there's a living Christ today that is Raising you up out of the old denominational making the life of God to live can you say Amen oh yes he says there's no devil no church or anything in a theology can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus Christ we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him amen the old things what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinions it changes our Notions it sets our affections on the things which are above and this drinking smoking gambling things that used to do is dead it's beneath you you are quickened this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already can I hear it amen yes brings this body into a raptured condition oh that's the power of life uh now now I'm giving life now this bread is wholesome now this bread has healing now this bread has forgiveness this bread has Joy this bread is manifesting the Life of Christ because I am no longer my own he has control of me well glory to God aren't you glad for that amen you young people understand what I'm saying so when we talk about the Holy Ghost what we're saying is there's something real special God is already forgiveness Jesus Jesus forgave us he's paid the price he raised from the dead to justify us and now when the Holy Spirit comes and I want to tell you I believe God can fill with the Holy Ghost right here in this Wednesday night service well what do I have to do just be yielded just be flexible just be willing to say Lord I don't understand what the preacher's saying or I don't understand a lot of things but Lord I just I want what you've got for me you say well they had to Terry brother Wendell they had to Terry for 10 days in the upper room they had to Tarry you know we don't have to tarry today well praise the Lord they had to Terry because the day of Pentacles had not fully came Jesus was here in his fort for 40 days ascended up says go wait and scripture had to be fulfilled scripture is fulfilled so this is not the same as it was at Pentecost at the big or as as far as that goes now it is for whosoever will if you can believe that you can receive the Holy Spirit right now [Music] Amen brother window do I have to do a lot of crying do I have to do no no you have to be desperate you have to be desperate amen i i i i find I find that too many as as the musicians come I find that too many dry-eyed confessions that have claimed the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when I say dry eyed I mean either one coming to the Altar and then getting up and saying I got the holy ghost or want to getting happy and shouting and and then getting and then going coming back and says I had the Holy Ghost I have found that there are there are very few dry-eyed uh fillings of the Holy Ghost that has that that has lasted in what I have seen in my 30 years here in Pawnee and ministering around but I have found somebody that gets desperate before God and says God I want your life in me now he's not giving it to you because you're crying that's not it what I'm saying is your tears are coming because there is a cry of desperate on the inside of you saying I must have this or else yeah brother Branham says he says that and that man will beat his beat the altar until his fists are raw he says but when that man gets up you'll receive the Holy Ghost does that mean you have to beat the altar steal your Feast of fist is raw no it's the desire it's the cry within me saying I want the exact same thing that they had amen and I think that's what we need or give me that kind amen then it'll Quicken us change his attitudes changes Hearts changes lives changes directions takes us from the old sinful me into a brand new life the Apostle Paul says old things have passed away and behold all things have become new well glory to God Lord let that yeast let let that let that power not the power not the leaven of the Pharisees not the doctrine of the Pharisees I want the doctrine of Christ The Life of Christ in me let's stand to our feet tonight praise the Lord hallelujah oh I love him Hallelujah did you know that the alpha church and the Omega Church is going to be the same church he says I am Alpha and Omega well glory to God I don't I'm not I'm not interested in what happened you know back in in this day or that day or this day I'm knowing that I'm in the rapturing church and the promise was that Jesus would be Alpha the first and he would be Omega the last well I happen to be in the last loaf I happen to be in the last church and I want the very life that he had moving within me it might make you shout it might make you cry it might make it but there's one thing about it it'll make us all Christians that'll make that word to live in US and when Hell Comes hits us hard there will be something there that just keeps on bubbling and bubbling and I just want to say here tonight as brother random said also dry hides can come back and get oiled up oil me up Hallelujah I used to be one of those youngins uh uh it used to be one of those youngins preaching out all the dry hides but now I become one of those old older Fellers amen
