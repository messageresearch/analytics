[38:26] and my will becomes enthralled in your
[38:31] love.
[38:34] When all things that surround
[38:37] become shadows
[38:40] in the light of you,
[38:45] of you.
[38:47] I worship you,
[38:51] [Music]
[38:55] Lord. I worship you.
[39:00] [Music]
[39:04] The reason I live
[39:09] is to worship
[39:12] you.
[39:17] Oh, I worship you
[39:20] [Music]
[39:24] Lord. I worship
[39:27] only you.
[39:29] Only you
[39:32] [Music]
[39:33] the reason I live
[39:37] [Music]
[39:39] is to one. Oh many desire to look up in
[39:42] on the things of him that we do tonight.
[39:47] Oh, when I look into your holiness
[39:55] and I get to gaze into your loveliness.
[40:02] And when all things that surround
[40:07] become shadows in the light of you.
[40:17] And when I find the joy of reaching your
[40:22] heart
[40:25] and my will becomes enthralled in your
[40:30] love.
[40:32] And when all things that surround
[40:36] become shadows in the light of you,
[40:44] [Music]
[40:46] Lord, I worship you.
[40:50] [Music]
[41:16] I worship you.
[41:23] I worship you.
[41:31] The reason I live
[41:35] [Music]
[41:36] is to worship
[41:39] you.
[41:42] [Music]
[41:44] Praise the Lord.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; All right. For those of you that have
[41:54] your Bibles, we'll go ahead and turn to
[41:56] our scriptures. We're going to start off
[41:59] at Genesis 1:1,
[42:13] quick and easy for everybody to find
[42:15] very front of the book.
[42:17] So, Genesis 1:1, in the beginning, God
[42:21] created the heaven and the earth. and
[42:23] the earth was without form and void, and
[42:26] darkness was upon the face of the deep,
[42:28] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[42:30] face of the waters. Now, let's turn to
[42:34] Job chapter 38,
[42:45] Job 38, and we're going to start at
[42:47] verse 4.
[42:59] Job chapter 38 starting at verse 4.
[43:03] Where was thou when I laid the
[43:05] foundations of the earth? Declare, if
[43:07] thou hast understanding, who hath laid
[43:10] the measures thereof, if thou knowest,
[43:12] or who hath stretched the line upon it?
[43:15] Whereupon are the foundations thereof
[43:17] fastened? or who laid the cornerstone
[43:19] thereof. When the morning stars sang
[43:22] together and all the sons of God shouted
[43:25] for joy.
[43:27] Let's go ahead and go before the Lord.
[43:32] Lord Jesus, we come into your presence
[43:33] this evening, Lord. And Lord, we just
[43:35] thank you for allowing us to to gather
[43:38] together once more. Lord, I pray that
[43:40] you would Lord, take these
[43:44] scriptures and quotes and the thoughts
[43:46] that I've put together, Lord. And Lord,
[43:49] I pray that you would take control of
[43:51] them completely, Lord. I Lord, you know
[43:53] the the direction that I've been
[43:55] thinking, but Lord, if that's not the
[43:56] direction that we should go, I pray that
[43:58] you would steer me to what needs to be
[44:00] said, Lord. Lord, you know the people
[44:02] here, Lord. You know what's on their
[44:04] hearts, Lord. You know their needs. you
[44:06] know what they're what they're dealing
[44:08] with and what they're facing. Lord, I
[44:10] pray that you would just help me to to
[44:12] say the right words. Lord, may you just
[44:14] be in everything that's said, Lord. May
[44:16] it speak encouragement to those that are
[44:18] downtrodden. Lord, may it help those to
[44:21] to overcome that are that are trying to
[44:23] break free. Lord, may it provide
[44:24] correction to those that are that are
[44:26] that are unsure, Lord. And Lord, may you
[44:29] just be able to take control of
[44:31] everything, Lord. We just commit the
[44:33] reign of the service into your hands. In
[44:35] the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[44:37] Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; You may all have your seats.
[44:45] You know, I was
[44:47] looking up online because I was curious
[44:50] about something as I was kind of
[44:52] studying along the lines for this
[44:54] sermon. And I found that according to
[44:58] Google, which we know can never be
[45:00] wrong, um, according to Google, there
[45:02] are over 4,000 religions in the world.
[45:07] Now, all 4,000 of those religions along
[45:11] with who knows how many philosophies
[45:15] are really trying to answer three
[45:17] questions. If you do some research and
[45:20] look up things, you find everything is
[45:21] really based around at the very
[45:24] beginning that there are three questions
[45:27] that everyone is trying to answer. At
[45:29] some point in their life, every every
[45:31] person, whether they even realize it or
[45:32] not, are trying to answer three
[45:34] questions in their life. They're trying
[45:37] to answer who am I?
[45:39] Where did I come from?
[45:42] And where am I going after I die?
[45:46] That is what everyone gets wrapped up in
[45:49] on. That's what every religion is trying
[45:52] to provide an answer for. That's what
[45:54] every philosophy that's out there is
[45:57] trying to provide an answer for. They're
[45:59] trying to answer these questions that
[46:03] are really ingrained into us.
[46:07] We've been built this way to where we're
[46:10] looking for our purpose. We're looking
[46:12] for who we are. We're looking for where
[46:15] we came from. We're looking for
[46:18] where are we going after we die? What's
[46:23] what's going to happen next? What's the
[46:25] next thing we're going to face?
[46:29] In fact, brother Brandham even mentioned
[46:31] these questions a couple of times
[46:33] through his sermons, which I didn't
[46:35] realize until I started studying this. I
[46:37] started looking up and here I found
[46:39] brother Brandham had talked about it. So
[46:41] in the sermon, the sign of this time in
[46:44] 1963, brother Brandham says, "There is
[46:46] not a person living, but what I like to
[46:49] look past the time, the curtain, and
[46:51] ask, where did I come from? Who am I?
[46:55] Where am I going?" Of all the fine books
[46:58] that's been read, the the great master
[47:00] selections that have been made, there's
[47:02] only one book that reveals who you are,
[47:04] where you come from, and where you're
[47:06] going. That's it. That's it. And it also
[47:08] lets us look past the curtain to see it.
[47:13] Now, when you start to look up, and
[47:15] we're not going to spend a ton of time
[47:18] on on all of these, but just kind of run
[47:20] through some things I was looking at,
[47:21] but if you look at to uh the religion of
[47:26] Islam,
[47:27] according to the religion of Islam, who
[47:30] am I? You're a servant and a vice regent
[47:33] of Allah, created to worship him and
[47:35] live by his guidance. Where did you come
[47:38] from? Well, Allah created Adam from clay
[47:40] and all humanity from him and his
[47:42] spouse. Where are you going? After
[47:45] death, resurrection, and judgment, the
[47:48] faithful enter paradise. Others face
[47:50] hell depending on Allah's mercy. And
[47:54] what's the This is a question that I
[47:56] added just extra. What is the ultimate
[47:58] reward for being a a good believer?
[48:01] Well, in Islam, you get eternal life and
[48:04] janna with peace, joy, and closeness to
[48:07] Allah.
[48:09] Buddhism,
[48:10] who am I? There is no permanent self.
[48:14] You're a temporary collection of
[48:15] changing physical and mental processes.
[48:18] Where did you come from? You're a result
[48:20] of countless causes and karma from
[48:22] previous lives. There is no first
[48:25] beginning.
[48:26] Where are you going? Rebirth in samsara
[48:30] until nirvana is attained. Liberation
[48:32] ends the cycle of suffering.
[48:36] I don't want to do that.
[48:39] Brother Merl, can you imagine? You have
[48:40] to keep living life over and over and
[48:44] over until finally you get it right.
[48:48] It's going to take a long time. I mean
[48:51] the ultimate reward if you are a good
[48:53] Buddhist attaining nirvana freedom for
[48:56] suffering and the cycle of rebirth
[48:58] experiencing ultimate peace
[49:01] in Hinduism.
[49:04] Who am I? You're an eternal soul part of
[49:06] the universal reality. Your true self is
[49:09] divine and eternal. Where did I come
[49:11] from? The universe is eternal is eternal
[49:14] and cyclical. Each soul is reborn
[49:16] through karma. Creation stories vary but
[49:18] often involve gods like Brahma creating
[49:21] the world. Where am I going? Rebirth
[49:24] continues according to karma until
[49:27] moksha which is liberation is achieved.
[49:29] Maksha unites the soul with Brahma and
[49:32] ends the cycle. The ultimate reward for
[49:34] being a good member attaining moaksha
[49:37] liberation from the cycle of rebirth and
[49:38] union of the soul with Brahma
[49:40] experiencing eternal bliss.
[49:45] Now looking it up I and this is just
[49:48] because of where we are. I looked up
[49:50] according to uh the old traditional
[49:53] Pawnee religion.
[49:55] Who am I? A being of earth and sky part
[49:58] of a cosmic family created by Tiwa. I'm
[50:01] probably not pronouncing that right, but
[50:03] with sacred duties to maintain harmony.
[50:06] Where did I come from? Descended from
[50:08] the first man and woman, sent by morning
[50:11] star and evening star who were created
[50:13] by Turoa. Earth is prepared by spiritual
[50:15] beings. Where am I going? After death,
[50:19] the soul travels west to join the star
[50:21] people in the spirit world. Continuation
[50:24] of the cosmic cycle.
[50:26] And what is the ultimate reward for
[50:28] being a good member? Peace and harmony
[50:31] in the afterlife among the star people.
[50:34] Continued place in the cosmic order.
[50:38] And then a very popular view
[50:42] which I would classify as a religion but
[50:45] most people wouldn't. It's going to be
[50:47] what
[50:49] most kids are taught in their textbooks.
[50:51] This is going to be the evolutionary
[50:53] view. According to that, who am I?
[50:56] You're a homo sapien, a product of
[50:58] millions of years of evolution shaped by
[51:00] biology and culture.
[51:02] Where did I come from?
[51:04] Well, life began 3.5 billion years ago.
[51:07] Humans evolve from primates, ancestors
[51:09] over millions of years. Where am I
[51:12] going? The body returns to Earth. No
[51:15] afterlife predicted by science. Legacy
[51:18] continues in impact and genetics.
[51:21] The ultimate reward for being a good
[51:22] member. There is no supernatural reward.
[51:25] Satisfaction of contributing to human
[51:27] progress, well-being, and the survival
[51:29] of one's genetic and cultural legacy.
[51:37] Whatever
[51:39] religion, whatever philosophy is the one
[51:42] that you go, this is what I'm going to
[51:44] ascribe to. This is what I'm going to
[51:46] believe. This is where I'm going to go.
[51:49] The answers to those questions
[51:52] affect your day-to-day life. They affect
[51:55] how you live. At least they should.
[52:00] Now, there are plenty of people that
[52:02] claim to be Christians.
[52:04] They claim that that's their religion.
[52:08] But when you look at their life, you
[52:10] realize
[52:12] they obviously don't believe the
[52:15] Christian answers to those questions
[52:18] because that's not how they live their
[52:21] life
[52:24] according to Christianity. And we'll go
[52:25] into this more in a few moments. Who am
[52:28] I? A child of God made in his image with
[52:31] inherent dignity and purpose to know and
[52:33] serve him. Where did I come from? God
[52:37] created Adam and Eve as the first
[52:38] humans. All people are descended from
[52:41] them. Where am I going? Eternal life
[52:44] with God in heaven for believers in
[52:46] Christ. Separation from God for those
[52:49] who reject him. The ultimate reward for
[52:52] being a good member is eternal life in
[52:54] heaven with God, experiencing perfect
[52:55] joy, love, and fellowship in his
[52:58] presence.
[53:01] Brother Random says in the sermon, the
[53:03] 10 virgins and the 144,000 Jews, he
[53:05] says,
[53:07] "I condemned in the chains of sin in the
[53:09] prison house of hell, condemned, guilty,
[53:12] going away to be destroyed forever, and
[53:14] somebody took my place."
[53:17] It was about 18, 20 years old. One day,
[53:19] the Holy Spirit, I said, "Well, who am
[53:21] I? Where did I come from? Where am I
[53:23] going?" He said, "He took your place.
[53:25] You were going there. He took your
[53:27] place. There he is. I said, "Oh lamb of
[53:30] God. Oh lamb of God. I come. I come.
[53:32] Nothing in my arms I bring. I have
[53:34] nothing to offer you, Lord. Just simply
[53:36] to thy cross I cling. That's all I got."
[53:39] And he took me in. He clothed me like
[53:40] the father with the prodigal son. Put a
[53:43] new garment upon me. The garment not of
[53:45] mine. His garment of his righteousness
[53:47] he put upon me and a wedding ring upon
[53:50] my finger that I'll be the bride that
[53:51] day. Now the fatted calf has been
[53:53] killed. And we're rejoicing because I
[53:55] was once dead and now I'm alive. I was
[53:57] once lost and now I'm found.
[54:02] The world goes through these questions
[54:04] and
[54:08] like I said, the answers
[54:10] affect the way that you live your life.
[54:13] You know, if we are going to believe the
[54:15] way that they want to teach in the
[54:16] textbooks and you want to follow the
[54:18] evolutionary rem model that well,
[54:22] I came out of primordial sludge
[54:25] somewhere
[54:26] over millions of years, millions of
[54:28] years, I'm now here in human form. I get
[54:32] to live my finite life and then I die
[54:35] and I'm gone.
[54:38] Which if that's true, then while I'm
[54:40] here on earth, I need to experience as
[54:43] much enjoyment and as much pleasure I
[54:45] can because this is all I got.
[54:49] If this is this is it, if there's
[54:51] nothing after I die, then I better make
[54:54] the most of this.
[55:00] And if you look at people living in the
[55:02] world around you, even those that are
[55:05] claiming Christianity,
[55:07] most people are living according to that
[55:09] credence,
[55:10] they are living according to the idea,
[55:13] this is what I got, so I need to enjoy
[55:15] it as much as possible.
[55:18] This is what I got and so I need to make
[55:20] sure that I'm having as much fun, I'm
[55:23] having as much pleasure
[55:26] because this is it.
[55:29] They're not living with the mindset that
[55:31] there's something that happens after
[55:33] death. Most people are living in the
[55:35] mindset that I die and it's over.
[55:41] It's one of the reasons that you'll find
[55:42] people getting involved in
[55:46] everything.
[55:50] Why would someone want to take the first
[55:52] drink? Why would somebody want to try
[55:54] the first batch of drugs? Why would
[55:57] somebody want to be promiscuous for the
[56:00] first time?
[56:02] Each one of those are being led from an
[56:05] answer and from a mindset that says
[56:09] there's nothing that happens after I
[56:10] die. There's nothing to look forward to.
[56:14] So, I need to live it now.
[56:17] And I need to enjoy what I can in this
[56:21] flesh because that's all I got.
[56:24] It's the only thing that's coming.
[56:28] But if we're living as Christians,
[56:30] obviously we have a completely different
[56:32] answer to all of these qu questions and
[56:35] we're supposed to be living a completely
[56:37] different life.
[56:44] Genesis 1 and verse 27.
[56:49] So God created man in his own image. In
[56:52] the image of God created he him. Male
[56:54] and female created he them.
[56:57] Psalms 139:14.
[57:02] I will praise thee, for I am fearfully
[57:04] and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy
[57:07] works, and that my soul knoweth right
[57:10] well.
[57:12] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10.
[57:18] For we are his workmanship, created in
[57:21] Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
[57:24] hath before ordained that we should walk
[57:26] in them.
[57:28] Who am I?
[57:30] I'm a child of God.
[57:32] Who am I? I'm his creation.
[57:36] Who am I? I'm the bride of Christ. Who
[57:39] am I? I'm his representative on earth.
[57:44] Galatians chapter 3
[57:47] and verse 26.
[57:52] For ye are the children of God by faith
[57:54] in Christ Jesus. For as many of you has
[57:57] been baptized into Christ have put on
[57:59] Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek.
[58:02] There is neither bond nor free. There is
[58:04] neither male nor female. For you are all
[58:07] one in Christ Jesus. And if you be
[58:09] Christ, then you are Abraham's seed and
[58:11] hes according to the promise.
[58:15] 1 Peter chapter 2
[58:19] and verse 9.
[58:23] But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
[58:26] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[58:29] people, that ye should sh show forth the
[58:32] praises of him who hath called you out
[58:34] of darkness into his marvelous light.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:39] Who am I?
[58:42] I'm created in God's image.
[58:44] Who am I? I'm fearfully and wonderfully
[58:46] made.
[58:48] Who am I? I'm his workmanship.
[58:52] Who am I? I'm a child of God.
[58:56] Who am I? I'm an heir of God.
[58:59] Who am I? I'm a chosen generation, a
[59:01] royal p priesthood, a holy nation, a
[59:04] peculiar people.
[59:09] Where did I come from?
[59:11] Genesis chapter 2 and verse 7.
[59:17] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[59:19] of the ground and breathed into his
[59:21] nostrils the breath of life and man
[59:24] became a living soul.
[59:27] Colossians
[59:29] 1 and verse 16.
[59:34] For by him were all things created that
[59:37] in heaven that are in earth, visible and
[59:40] invisible, whether they be thrones or
[59:42] dominions or principalities or powers.
[59:44] All things were created by him and for
[59:47] him.
[59:51] Where did I come from?
[59:54] God created.
[59:56] God formed.
[59:59] Let's go to Acts chapter 17
[1:00:03] and starting at verse 22.
[1:00:12] Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars
[1:00:14] Hill and said, "Ye men of Athens, I
[1:00:18] perceive that in all things ye are too
[1:00:20] stup super superstitious.
[1:00:22] For as I passed by and beheld your
[1:00:24] devotions, I found an altar with this
[1:00:26] inscription, to the unknown God, whom
[1:00:30] therefore ye ignorantly worship, him I
[1:00:33] declare unto you.
[1:00:36] God that made the world and all things
[1:00:38] therein.
[1:00:40] So here's Paul.
[1:00:42] He's in Athens
[1:00:45] on Mars Hill speaking to the Greeks.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; He speaks about the unknown god. The
[1:00:52] first things he tells them is,
[1:00:55] "Where did you come from? This is the
[1:00:57] God that made all the world
[1:01:00] and everything there is therein."
[1:01:03] He then continues on, seeing that he is
[1:01:05] the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth
[1:01:07] not in temples made with hands, neither
[1:01:10] is worshiped with men's hands, as though
[1:01:11] he needed anything, seeing he giveth all
[1:01:14] to life and breath in all things, and
[1:01:16] hath made of one blood all nations of
[1:01:18] men, for to dwell in all the face of the
[1:01:21] earth, and hath determined the times
[1:01:23] before appointed, and the bounds of
[1:01:25] their habitation, that they should seek
[1:01:27] the Lord, if happily they might feel
[1:01:29] after him, and find him, though he be
[1:01:32] not far off from every one of of us. For
[1:01:34] in him we live and move and have our
[1:01:37] being, as certain also of your poets
[1:01:39] have said, for we are also his
[1:01:42] offspring.
[1:01:43] Who am I? I'm the offspring of God. So
[1:01:48] Paul, as he's speaking to them, he's
[1:01:50] answering these questions.
[1:01:53] They I'm sure they didn't realize it.
[1:01:55] I'm sure they weren't sitting there with
[1:01:57] these three questions in their mind
[1:01:58] waiting to see if he checked all the
[1:01:59] boxes. But yet this is still how Paul as
[1:02:02] he's coming to them is presenting. He's
[1:02:05] going these are the three questions
[1:02:06] every one of you is looking for the
[1:02:08] answer for.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and in just a few
[1:02:14] verses I'll lay this out for you.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; For as much then as we are the offspring
[1:02:20] of God,
[1:02:22] we ought not to think that the Godhead
[1:02:24] is like unto gold or silver or stone
[1:02:26] graven by art and man's device. And the
[1:02:29] times of this ignorance God winked at,
[1:02:32] but now commandeth all men everywhere to
[1:02:34] repent, because he hath appointed a day
[1:02:38] in the which he will judge the world in
[1:02:40] righteousness, by that man whom he hath
[1:02:42] ordained, whereof he hath given
[1:02:44] assurance unto all men, in that he hath
[1:02:47] raised him from the dead.
[1:02:53] Are we ending in the grave?
[1:02:55] Or is Paul saying that there's something
[1:02:57] more?
[1:03:01] I've read this over multiple times. I
[1:03:03] think most of us have read Paul on Mars
[1:03:05] Hill and I had never really noticed that
[1:03:09] he takes the time basically in these
[1:03:14] nine verses.
[1:03:19] Nine verses of him speaking and he
[1:03:22] covers here. Let me answer the three
[1:03:24] questions that every religion tries to
[1:03:27] answer, that every philosophy is trying
[1:03:29] to answer. Let me go ahead and tell you,
[1:03:34] where did you come from? God created the
[1:03:36] world. He made it all. Everything that's
[1:03:39] in it, he made it. Who are you? We are
[1:03:43] his offspring.
[1:03:45] We're children of God.
[1:03:48] Where are we going?
[1:03:51] He's going to judge and he's going to
[1:03:53] raise us from the dead.
[1:03:57] This is it. This is
[1:04:02] everything laid out in a short sermon.
[1:04:08] John chapter 14
[1:04:11] verse two.
[1:04:16] Where am I going? In my father's house
[1:04:18] are many mansions. If it were not so, I
[1:04:21] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[1:04:23] place for you. And if I go and prepare a
[1:04:26] place for you, I will come again and
[1:04:28] receive you unto myself. And where I am,
[1:04:31] there you may be also.
[1:04:34] Philippians chapter 3
[1:04:37] and verse 20.
[1:04:42] For our conversation is in heaven. From
[1:04:45] whence also we look for the Savior, the
[1:04:47] Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our
[1:04:50] vile body, that it may be fashioned like
[1:04:52] unto his glorious body, according to the
[1:04:55] working whereby he is able, even to
[1:04:57] subdue all things unto himself.
[1:05:01] Revelation chapter 21
[1:05:04] and verse 4.
[1:05:10] And God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:05:12] their eyes. And there shall be no more
[1:05:14] death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
[1:05:17] neither shall there be any more pain,
[1:05:19] for the former things are passed away.
[1:05:27] Now, none of these are verses that
[1:05:30] are new. I'm sure every one of us have
[1:05:33] read these verses
[1:05:36] multiple times as we go through it.
[1:05:41] And really, it ends up coming back to us
[1:05:43] asking a few more questions. If we want
[1:05:46] to believe that these are the answers to
[1:05:48] the three great philosophical questions,
[1:05:50] if that's what you want to call them, if
[1:05:52] those are the answers,
[1:05:56] does it matter?
[1:05:59] Does it matter where we come from?
[1:06:03] Does it matter who created us?
[1:06:08] And more than that, do our lives reflect
[1:06:10] what we say that we believe?
[1:06:15] Like I said, we there are countless
[1:06:17] Christians that would say that's what
[1:06:20] they believe.
[1:06:22] They say that yes, God created.
[1:06:26] Yes, I'm a child of God. And yes, I
[1:06:29] believe that I'm going to be in heaven
[1:06:30] with him. They would go through and say
[1:06:33] yes to all those. Check all the boxes.
[1:06:36] Thumbs up. I'm there with you.
[1:06:40] But then it comes the question of is
[1:06:42] that how you're living your life.
[1:06:47] Now really I heard someone talking years
[1:06:49] ago
[1:06:52] they were talking about the evolution
[1:06:53] con concept but they pointed out they
[1:06:55] said you know if whatever you truly
[1:06:58] believe there
[1:07:00] if you
[1:07:02] believe the evolution idea great I can
[1:07:04] live however I want do whatever I want.
[1:07:09] There is no true good or evil.
[1:07:14] There may be laws that people agreed
[1:07:16] together to create, but you can't truly
[1:07:19] call it good or evil because we all just
[1:07:22] came from primordial slime.
[1:07:25] So my truth is what's important. And you
[1:07:29] hear that talked about if you listen to
[1:07:31] the news or you listen to different
[1:07:32] people saying it's all well each person
[1:07:34] can have their own truth. They can have
[1:07:36] their their own belief.
[1:07:40] But if we
[1:07:43] believe Christ, if we truly believe
[1:07:46] these are the answers to those
[1:07:48] questions,
[1:07:51] well, if I am created by God,
[1:07:55] if I am his workmanship,
[1:07:59] then I probably need to ask him what he
[1:08:02] wants me to do.
[1:08:04] I probably need to ask him
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; how I'm supposed to live because if he
[1:08:10] was powerful enough to make me,
[1:08:13] then he probably has a reason for it.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not just here to live however I feel
[1:08:21] is right or however I want or do the
[1:08:25] things that make me feel good.
[1:08:29] I'm here to live for a purpose.
[1:08:39] Romans chapter 9
[1:08:41] and verse 20.
[1:08:46] Nay, but oh man, who art thou that
[1:08:47] repliest against God? Shall the thing
[1:08:50] formed say to him that formed it, why
[1:08:52] hast thou made me thus? Hath not the
[1:08:55] powder power over the clay of the same
[1:08:57] lunt lump to make one vessel unto honor
[1:09:00] and another one unto dishonor?
[1:09:15] You know, we have
[1:09:19] an epidemic in the world of
[1:09:24] depression
[1:09:25] and people feeling cut off and alone.
[1:09:29] And
[1:09:30] I know brother Wendell can testify to it
[1:09:33] of the number of
[1:09:36] young people that he sees at the
[1:09:38] different meetings, the few meetings
[1:09:39] that he goes and preaches that will come
[1:09:41] up and they're struggling with
[1:09:43] depression or they're struggling with
[1:09:44] suicidal thoughts and they're they're
[1:09:46] struggling with these different things.
[1:09:50] And we know that just because you're a
[1:09:53] Christian doesn't mean that you're
[1:09:54] immune from fighting.
[1:09:57] It doesn't mean that we're immune from
[1:09:59] battling.
[1:10:04] But we also have a thing if we're taking
[1:10:06] into it and we're truly believing this
[1:10:08] like if God made me for a purpose.
[1:10:11] If God made me for a reason,
[1:10:16] God doesn't make junk.
[1:10:19] God doesn't make trash that gets thrown
[1:10:21] aside.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; God doesn't make someone that's
[1:10:25] worthless. He doesn't make someone
[1:10:28] that's not valuable. He doesn't make
[1:10:31] someone that's unimportant.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; And so when Satan wants to come in and
[1:10:37] tries
[1:10:39] to battle and oppress and tries to cut
[1:10:41] off and go, "You're all alone. You don't
[1:10:43] matter. You could die now and the world
[1:10:46] would go on and no one would even miss
[1:10:47] you."
[1:10:50] And yet God's here saying, "You're mine.
[1:10:54] I made you.
[1:10:56] And if the God of all heaven and earth
[1:11:00] chose
[1:11:02] to make me, chose to call me,
[1:11:08] then there is no way I can be worthless.
[1:11:11] There is no way that I can be
[1:11:14] unimportant. And yeah, maybe in the
[1:11:17] world's eyes I'm unimportant.
[1:11:21] That's fine.
[1:11:25] Maybe on social media I'm unimportant.
[1:11:28] Maybe in the main news media I'm
[1:11:31] unimportant. Maybe in the town of Pawne
[1:11:35] or the town of Stillwater I'm
[1:11:37] unimportant.
[1:11:39] That's fine.
[1:11:43] If God wants me to be important in one
[1:11:45] of those places, wonderful.
[1:11:48] But that's not mine to worry about.
[1:11:53] God created me for a purpose.
[1:11:57] And he doesn't have to necessarily tell
[1:11:59] me what my purpose is.
[1:12:04] He doesn't have to tell me, "All right,
[1:12:05] you're living your entire life because
[1:12:09] when you're this many years old, you're
[1:12:11] going to meet this person on the corner,
[1:12:13] and you're going to testify to them,
[1:12:18] and you're going to plant a seed, and
[1:12:20] they are then going to move off to
[1:12:23] Siberia, and you're never going to see
[1:12:25] them again. But they're going to end up
[1:12:27] accepting
[1:12:30] me because of what you said.
[1:12:36] He There is nowhere that God promises he
[1:12:39] will tell us what we were meant to do.
[1:12:43] He promises he will guide our steps. He
[1:12:46] will guide our paths. He will show us
[1:12:48] that next step.
[1:12:50] He's not going to show us what we're
[1:12:51] supposed to be in five years or 10 years
[1:12:52] or He's not going to tell us, "All
[1:12:55] right, you just accomplished the whole
[1:12:57] purpose I had for you on earth.
[1:13:01] You just did it. This was this was the
[1:13:04] the the big thing you were here for. We
[1:13:06] just did it.
[1:13:09] That's not
[1:13:11] that's not it's not there.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; You're not going to find that verse.
[1:13:18] And I'm also not one that would even
[1:13:21] hold on to the thing that God created me
[1:13:23] for just one giant purpose and that's
[1:13:26] it.
[1:13:29] There are lots of little moments. There
[1:13:31] are lots of little times.
[1:13:37] You know, I can think just about
[1:13:41] some of my late night conversations with
[1:13:43] my children.
[1:13:45] And they're not even always just about
[1:13:48] about the Lord. It could be about
[1:13:51] whatever. It could be going on anything.
[1:13:55] But those moments investing in them,
[1:13:58] small things here and there.
[1:14:05] Small moments where,
[1:14:08] you know, just the other night, Sister
[1:14:11] Angie watched our few of our kids for
[1:14:13] us.
[1:14:15] I don't know what kind of conversations
[1:14:17] they had. I don't know what was going
[1:14:19] on.
[1:14:21] Kids had fun. They were still alive when
[1:14:23] we picked them up.
[1:14:26] It's really about all we ask for.
[1:14:31] But I know that Sister Angie has kept
[1:14:33] lots of kids lots of times over the
[1:14:36] years
[1:14:38] and there have been all kinds of
[1:14:40] conversations.
[1:14:42] There have been all kinds of moments.
[1:14:46] We talk about all the time that Brother
[1:14:47] Donald is known for texting
[1:14:51] everybody
[1:14:54] out of the blue. How you doing, brother?
[1:14:56] Was just thinking about you. Was just
[1:14:58] praying for you.
[1:15:00] It's not long in-depth conversations. It
[1:15:03] might be two or three messages and it's
[1:15:05] over.
[1:15:09] But yet those little interactions, those
[1:15:12] those little moments
[1:15:15] And I'm not saying that brother Donald
[1:15:18] hasn't had some moments where he
[1:15:19] personally led someone to Christ. What
[1:15:21] I'm pointing out is like there are small
[1:15:24] things that we happen that we do
[1:15:26] throughout our life.
[1:15:32] How many times is either with your own
[1:15:36] children or helping to take care of
[1:15:38] somebody else's kids or doing different
[1:15:40] things and you have some sort of
[1:15:42] conversation or maybe they're just
[1:15:45] watching you and they're seeing the way
[1:15:46] that you're living your life, the way
[1:15:48] that you react to different things, the
[1:15:50] way that you handle different things.
[1:15:54] They're seeing a witness there
[1:15:56] that's not from their parents who they
[1:15:59] see every day, but it's somebody else
[1:16:02] going, "Wow, there are other people that
[1:16:04] believe the same thing. There are other
[1:16:07] people that hold up this is the same
[1:16:09] standard."
[1:16:14] those little moments when we're showing
[1:16:19] and particularly with these kids that
[1:16:21] we're helping to remind them and show
[1:16:23] them over and over you're important
[1:16:28] and God has a purpose for you and God
[1:16:31] has a reason for you being here.
[1:16:37] These young boys that are on the front
[1:16:39] row, they have plenty of years of
[1:16:40] growing up still to go. The older ones I
[1:16:43] would normally pick on aren't here right
[1:16:44] now.
[1:16:47] So these boys, they've got years to go.
[1:16:51] More than likely, none of them know for
[1:16:52] sure what their career is going to be
[1:16:54] yet.
[1:16:56] None of them know for sure this is what
[1:16:59] I'm going to do with my life. This is my
[1:17:03] purpose. Maybe they have ideas. Maybe
[1:17:06] like I want to be like dad. I want to be
[1:17:09] an electrician or I want to do this or I
[1:17:12] want to do that
[1:17:15] because my dad's big and strong and I
[1:17:17] want to be just like him.
[1:17:21] They might have some ideas. They might
[1:17:24] have
[1:17:25] some dreams, something they're
[1:17:27] imagining, but they don't know
[1:17:30] what God's going to lead them or what
[1:17:32] he's going to do to for them.
[1:17:35] They don't know for sure, hey, what am I
[1:17:37] called to do?
[1:17:40] Brother Wendell says it all the time,
[1:17:42] like,
[1:17:43] are any of them ministers? Are any of
[1:17:46] them deacons? Are any of them
[1:17:49] musicians coming up?
[1:17:53] Are any of them the prayer warriors that
[1:17:56] are going to be the behindthe-scenes
[1:17:57] support for everything?
[1:18:02] I don't know.
[1:18:04] I'm not I'm not a prophet that can look
[1:18:06] at them and go, I can see where your
[1:18:08] life's going to take you. I can see what
[1:18:11] is going to happen.
[1:18:16] But yet these kids will come up and
[1:18:19] particularly as they're going through
[1:18:21] the teenage years and
[1:18:24] Satan will do everything he can to make
[1:18:26] them feel
[1:18:29] worthless,
[1:18:31] to make them feel like they are cast
[1:18:34] aside, they're unimportant,
[1:18:37] nobody cares about you.
[1:18:42] And yet it's in all those moments
[1:18:46] that all these little investments that
[1:18:49] have come from parents and friends and
[1:18:52] family going into them.
[1:18:56] Maybe some of the things that are
[1:18:58] helping them hold on,
[1:19:00] the Lord can bring that back to their
[1:19:02] mind to go, you're not unimportant.
[1:19:05] You've been invested in. You've been
[1:19:07] cared for. You've been loved. then
[1:19:09] you've still got
[1:19:11] people around you
[1:19:15] that love you and that care for you.
[1:19:22] We don't have the right as the thing
[1:19:24] that's formed to ask him who formed us
[1:19:27] why he made us thus.
[1:19:32] I don't get to ask why God made me the
[1:19:36] way that I am.
[1:19:38] I can simply ask how he wants to use me
[1:19:43] because he's made me this way for a
[1:19:44] reason. He's made me to have this
[1:19:47] personality. He's made me to have
[1:19:51] this
[1:19:53] style in ministering. He's asked he's
[1:19:56] made me to have
[1:19:58] a certain type of skill set when I go to
[1:20:02] work and when I interact with people.
[1:20:05] He's created me this way for a reason
[1:20:06] and for a purpose.
[1:20:10] And so I don't get to sit here and go,
[1:20:12] "Well, God, why couldn't I be more like
[1:20:14] Brother Wendell? Why couldn't I do this?
[1:20:16] Or why couldn't I be more like Brother
[1:20:18] Mitch or Brother Robert? Why couldn't I
[1:20:22] be more like one of these other brothers
[1:20:24] or someone that's not even in this
[1:20:26] building? Why couldn't I be more like
[1:20:27] them?
[1:20:30] Why couldn't I
[1:20:33] have more resources? or why couldn't I
[1:20:36] be have have more talents or more skills
[1:20:39] or more whatever? Why couldn't I?
[1:20:49] But I can't ask. All right, Lord,
[1:20:53] how do you want to use me?
[1:20:56] You've created me for a purpose. You've
[1:21:00] had me go through life and different
[1:21:01] experiences and different challenges.
[1:21:07] How can I surrender myself a little bit
[1:21:09] more? How can you use me to accomplish
[1:21:12] the goals that you've created me for?
[1:21:20] You know, he when they're talking about
[1:21:22] the forming the clay, you know, they'll
[1:21:24] make some that are going to be pitchers.
[1:21:28] for water. Some are going to be vases
[1:21:30] for flowers to go in. Some going to be
[1:21:33] cups for someone to drink out of. Some
[1:21:36] are going to be platters or plates for
[1:21:38] food to be on.
[1:21:41] And yes, some are going to be chamber
[1:21:44] pots.
[1:21:46] And if you kids don't know what that is,
[1:21:47] you can ask your parents.
[1:21:51] Each one of these is for a purpose. Each
[1:21:54] one of these
[1:21:56] is being used in a certain manner.
[1:21:59] I'm not going to take my coffee mug and
[1:22:02] try to put a steak in it and then try to
[1:22:04] cut it up to eat out of.
[1:22:08] Could I do it?
[1:22:11] Eventually,
[1:22:12] there would be a lot of frustration, a
[1:22:15] lot of annoyance.
[1:22:17] Eventually, I could still eat the steak,
[1:22:21] but it'd be a whole lot easier if I just
[1:22:23] put it on the plate
[1:22:26] that's designed for the steak to sit on.
[1:22:30] It's nice and flat. I can easily cut it
[1:22:33] and eat.
[1:22:35] And I'm not going to take my sweet tea
[1:22:37] and pour it out on a plate and then try
[1:22:41] to drink from it.
[1:22:44] Once again, could I do it? Yes.
[1:22:48] Would it be messy? More than likely.
[1:22:51] Would I spill? Probably.
[1:22:54] Would I be able to drink something? Yes.
[1:22:58] So, if there was no other option,
[1:23:01] the only vessel that I have is a plate.
[1:23:03] I guess I'll use it because it's all I
[1:23:05] got.
[1:23:07] But it's going to work a whole lot
[1:23:08] better if I grab the glass or the mug
[1:23:10] out of the cabinet and fill it up with
[1:23:13] my sweet tea and hopefully some ice and
[1:23:16] then get to enjoy my nice cold beverage.
[1:23:20] For those of you that aren't sweet tea
[1:23:21] fans, you can put Dr. Pepper in instead.
[1:23:29] But the person who made these vessels,
[1:23:31] they didn't make the coffee mug for me
[1:23:34] to eat steak out of. They didn't make
[1:23:36] the plate for me to drink sweet tea off
[1:23:39] of.
[1:23:41] They were made for a purpose and a
[1:23:43] reason. And I don't think the plate is
[1:23:45] sitting in the cabinet looking at all
[1:23:47] the cups and mugs going, "Man, I really
[1:23:49] wish that someone could drink sweet tea
[1:23:51] or coffee out of me. I really wish that
[1:23:54] I could be used the same way that
[1:23:55] they're being used. I really wish that I
[1:23:59] had the same talents and abilities and
[1:24:01] skills as they did.
[1:24:07] And I know this is probably coming
[1:24:08] across very funny and childlike, but I'm
[1:24:10] trying to get it where the kids can
[1:24:12] understand here.
[1:24:16] God doesn't make each one of us to be
[1:24:17] the same.
[1:24:19] God doesn't design each one of us to do
[1:24:23] the same things or do the same work.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; God has
[1:24:30] created Sister Carol to be Sister Carol.
[1:24:34] And Sister Carol can
[1:24:38] reach out and connect to the native
[1:24:40] people around here way more than this
[1:24:42] white boy ever could.
[1:24:50] Deep South Boy, Florida.
[1:24:54] I am not there is sorry
[1:24:58] I can talk. I can visit, but I'm
[1:25:02] probably not going to relate quite the
[1:25:03] same way.
[1:25:07] God made me me.
[1:25:10] God made me to be raised in Florida to
[1:25:13] come from a Pennsylvania guy. My dad was
[1:25:16] from Pennsylvania, so he was as northern
[1:25:17] as they get.
[1:25:19] My mom was from Florida, so she was as
[1:25:21] southern as they get.
[1:25:23] So, I'm a mixture somewhere in there.
[1:25:30] And so I have my place where God has
[1:25:33] designed me and placed me to be able to
[1:25:37] reach certain people and communicate
[1:25:39] with certain people. And
[1:25:42] you know, I'm not I've never been a guy
[1:25:45] that's big into cars or big into sports.
[1:25:51] I know plenty of guys that are and they
[1:25:53] can talk stats of sports or talk about
[1:25:56] the types of engines that are in cars,
[1:25:59] the type of, you know, gear shift ratio
[1:26:01] and suspension and all this kind of
[1:26:03] stuff. And I'm sitting there going,
[1:26:05] "Uhhuh.
[1:26:08] Okay, great. I can look at a car, go,
[1:26:11] that looks nice.
[1:26:15] Does it drive? Can it get me from point
[1:26:17] A to point B? Does the AC work? Great.
[1:26:21] This is my kind of car. That's That's
[1:26:23] about as far as I get into it. All
[1:26:25] right.
[1:26:27] I've always been a reader, though. So,
[1:26:30] growing up, I had and even when I first
[1:26:33] started working, if there was somebody
[1:26:35] that wanted to talk about books or
[1:26:39] wanted to talk about creative type
[1:26:41] things like that, I was all into it. I
[1:26:45] knew different authors. I knew different
[1:26:46] the way different plots worked. I knew
[1:26:48] different things. And so I had my group
[1:26:51] that I was connecting with. They weren't
[1:26:53] the jocks. They weren't the gearheads.
[1:26:55] They weren't the any of these kind of
[1:26:57] things,
[1:26:59] but I had friends that they could relate
[1:27:02] to them
[1:27:04] and they could talk to them and they
[1:27:05] could speak their language and and
[1:27:08] connect and do all those things.
[1:27:14] I wasn't one that I
[1:27:17] knew a ton about music. I enjoyed
[1:27:19] singing,
[1:27:21] so I could talk a little bit in that
[1:27:22] realm,
[1:27:24] but I wasn't going to go into a whole
[1:27:26] lot with it.
[1:27:28] That wasn't how God designed me. That
[1:27:30] wasn't how God made me.
[1:27:34] And each one of us is made for a reason
[1:27:37] and made for a purpose.
[1:27:40] I asked the question, does it matter
[1:27:45] where we come from? Does it matter who
[1:27:47] created us? And
[1:27:49] ultimately, do our lives reflect what we
[1:27:53] say that we believe?
[1:27:56] Because if I really believe that
[1:27:59] God created everything, that God created
[1:28:02] me, that God called me,
[1:28:07] that God pulled me out and separated me
[1:28:13] for a reason and for a purpose.
[1:28:16] Then my life is about more than just
[1:28:19] what I want.
[1:28:22] My life is for more than
[1:28:26] even what I would say my goals and my
[1:28:28] dreams are. Now, God doesn't tell us
[1:28:31] that we shouldn't have goals and
[1:28:33] shouldn't be working towards things. I
[1:28:36] mean, anyone that was a farmer, they had
[1:28:39] to have goals of I want to get this kind
[1:28:41] of crop, so I'm going to work the field.
[1:28:43] I'm going to plant the seed. I'm going
[1:28:44] to do all these things. But ultimately,
[1:28:46] it's still up to God on whether I get a
[1:28:48] harvest or not.
[1:28:52] There was a goal there.
[1:28:55] They did not go, "I'm a farmer. Lord, I
[1:28:59] expect that field to have something for
[1:29:00] me to gather in in the autumn."
[1:29:06] He had to put in some work to try to
[1:29:08] accomplish what he wanted.
[1:29:12] God has placed me in certain roles. And
[1:29:14] so, I have read leadership books. I've
[1:29:18] done leadership classes. I've
[1:29:20] gone through human resource
[1:29:22] certifications. I've done different
[1:29:24] things because this is the direction
[1:29:25] that I was working. This is
[1:29:29] if you had asked me at 18,
[1:29:31] hey, are you going to have a career in
[1:29:33] human resources? I would have said, no,
[1:29:36] I'm going to be an accountant
[1:29:38] because that's what I was going to
[1:29:40] college for. And there's not a person
[1:29:42] that knows me today that goes, "Oh,
[1:29:44] yeah, you'd be a great accountant."
[1:29:47] But somehow at 18, I thought, "Hey, this
[1:29:49] is going to be a great career."
[1:29:52] 18-year-olds are stupid.
[1:29:55] Go ahead and put that out there.
[1:29:58] It's just the way it is.
[1:30:02] But God ordered my steps. God led me
[1:30:05] down paths for years to make me end up
[1:30:09] where I'm at now.
[1:30:13] It's not where I expected to be. It's
[1:30:15] not where I thought that I would be. But
[1:30:18] throughout that process, I still was
[1:30:21] work had to keep working towards some
[1:30:23] sort of goal
[1:30:25] because God didn't call us to sit around
[1:30:27] and do nothing.
[1:30:31] Hey, if I don't know exactly what career
[1:30:34] and I've been I've been on careers a lot
[1:30:36] lately because I've been talking to my
[1:30:37] oldest son about it because he's been
[1:30:39] thinking about it and talking about it.
[1:30:41] If you don't know what God wants you to
[1:30:42] do, pick something and try it. Like,
[1:30:46] you've got time. He's talked about,
[1:30:49] "Hey, maybe I want to do banking." Kind
[1:30:51] of like what Robert does. Like, great.
[1:30:54] If you can get a job at a bank, see what
[1:30:56] it's like. If you end up being
[1:30:58] miserable, switch to something else.
[1:31:01] It's not this. It's not This isn't the
[1:31:03] end of the world.
[1:31:05] I have seen way too many college kids
[1:31:09] through my years working at Chick-fil-A
[1:31:12] that when they realized the degree that
[1:31:13] they were working towards made them
[1:31:15] miserable.
[1:31:17] It wrecked their life
[1:31:20] because they didn't know this is what
[1:31:21] I've always wanted. This is what I've
[1:31:23] always been working towards. What am I
[1:31:26] going to do now? It's like you take six
[1:31:28] months to a year, figure out something
[1:31:30] else and try something else.
[1:31:34] is okay.
[1:31:36] God doesn't fully map it out for you,
[1:31:39] but he's made you to do something. He's
[1:31:43] made you for a purpose.
[1:31:45] God didn't make me to be an accountant,
[1:31:47] even if I thought that I was supposed to
[1:31:48] be an accountant when I was 18.
[1:31:54] I now can look back and go, "No, I'd be
[1:31:56] miserable trying to keep track of all
[1:31:58] those numbers and things. That's not the
[1:32:00] way my mind works.
[1:32:02] That's not how I fit.
[1:32:09] I am not
[1:32:13] brother Danny Stemon's father, brother
[1:32:14] John Stemon,
[1:32:16] who has
[1:32:18] passed away years ago now, but he was my
[1:32:21] pastor in Florida after my father had
[1:32:24] passed away.
[1:32:26] And brother John Stemon
[1:32:28] never met a stranger in his life.
[1:32:31] He
[1:32:34] and I I never personally saw him do
[1:32:35] this, but knowing his personality, I
[1:32:36] could completely see it. He would be one
[1:32:39] that years before when he was younger,
[1:32:41] he would be out on the street corner up
[1:32:43] on a box preaching to whoever would
[1:32:45] listen.
[1:32:47] He would talk to anyone and everyone.
[1:32:52] He ran everywhere.
[1:32:55] When we first moved there, my mom's
[1:32:56] house backed up against his house.
[1:33:01] And she thought there was an emergency
[1:33:03] over his house because she's in the
[1:33:05] kitchen washing dishes. She looks out
[1:33:07] the window. Here comes brother John
[1:33:09] running from the house across to the
[1:33:10] shed, runs back. She's like, "Did they
[1:33:14] bust a pipe?" And he's having to go get
[1:33:16] tools running back and forth because he
[1:33:18] did this multiple times, like full run
[1:33:20] each time.
[1:33:22] So she eventually called over there to
[1:33:23] ask his wife. She's like, "Is everything
[1:33:25] okay? Is there anything y'all need?"
[1:33:26] She's like, "I don't know. That's just
[1:33:29] how John gets everywhere.
[1:33:31] It's just what he does."
[1:33:36] He had a way of when he was testifying
[1:33:40] to people about the message, the first
[1:33:42] book he would give every single person
[1:33:46] was Serpent Seed. because he said if
[1:33:50] this chases them off they don't belong
[1:33:52] here.
[1:33:54] He didn't try to give it to him soft to
[1:33:56] get in. He was like can you take serpent
[1:33:58] seat or not? Let's go from there.
[1:34:04] That's not the way everybody testifies.
[1:34:08] That's not the way everyone should
[1:34:09] testify.
[1:34:11] But that's how God made him.
[1:34:16] He was
[1:34:21] the most loving, most welcoming man that
[1:34:24] I had known to that time.
[1:34:29] Steph would laugh cuz she would be over
[1:34:32] there with my cousin Jennifer driven
[1:34:34] over to their house to do something and
[1:34:36] brother John would come out to the car
[1:34:37] where my wife was just sitting in the
[1:34:39] car and be like, "Hey, can I get you a
[1:34:42] drink or something?" They weren't there
[1:34:44] to visit or stay. She was just sitting
[1:34:45] in the car while my cousin Jennifer ran
[1:34:48] in to pick up something or do whatever.
[1:34:51] Yeah. Brother John still came like, "Can
[1:34:53] I get you a drink? Hey, we're eating
[1:34:54] this in here. Would you like some or
[1:34:56] whatever?"
[1:34:58] That was him.
[1:35:01] That was Brother John Steman.
[1:35:06] You know, I'm sure we can share stories
[1:35:08] about all kinds of people in this church
[1:35:10] where you go, and I've heard people say
[1:35:12] it before. Oh, well, that's Sister
[1:35:14] Carol.
[1:35:15] That's just that's how Sister Carol does
[1:35:18] it. That's how she handles situations.
[1:35:21] That's how she does things because she's
[1:35:23] Sister Carol.
[1:35:26] Well, that's Brother Wendell. Well,
[1:35:28] that's Brother Merl. Well, that's
[1:35:30] whoever.
[1:35:32] because God has made them
[1:35:35] in a certain way. God has made them
[1:35:41] in a certain purpose.
[1:35:44] And God does that for each one of us.
[1:35:48] You know, brother Brandham,
[1:35:51] he would talk about
[1:35:55] Elvis Presley and he would talk about
[1:35:57] how he started off in the Pentecostal
[1:36:01] world and he learned some of those moves
[1:36:04] in the Pentecostal world
[1:36:08] and then he took it out to make millions
[1:36:10] with and do this that or the other.
[1:36:13] He had a gift. He had a talent.
[1:36:18] He had an ability that
[1:36:22] should have been used in one way.
[1:36:30] God gives each one of us gifts and
[1:36:32] talents that we can either surrender to
[1:36:34] him.
[1:36:36] And if we believe as Christians that
[1:36:40] he's created us,
[1:36:42] that we're his children,
[1:36:45] then we're supposed to be surrendering
[1:36:47] it all to him.
[1:36:52] But when we instead take the route of
[1:36:55] going,
[1:36:57] "Well, I want this to be
[1:37:01] about what I want to do. I want this to
[1:37:03] be about
[1:37:05] what's going to make me happy. I want
[1:37:08] this to be about what
[1:37:11] is going to bring me pleasure in some
[1:37:12] form.
[1:37:14] Then our very life is reflecting that we
[1:37:17] don't actually believe the answers to
[1:37:19] those three questions that we say we
[1:37:20] believe.
[1:37:23] Because if I'm living a life that's
[1:37:24] completely focused on me, if I'm living
[1:37:26] a life that's completely focused on my
[1:37:28] wants and my desires, then can I really
[1:37:31] say that I believe God created me
[1:37:36] and God made me
[1:37:39] and that there's a purpose for my life?
[1:37:57] In the sermon Jesus Christ the same
[1:37:58] yesterday, today and forever.
[1:38:02] Brother the Random says, "But now and
[1:38:04] then as we are sons and daughters of God
[1:38:06] and joint heirs with him in the kingdom,
[1:38:08] then we express him in our lives."
[1:38:11] Sometimes if if many of us would just
[1:38:13] live our sermons instead of preaching
[1:38:15] it, I think it would be better if we
[1:38:17] just go ahead and live the sermon. You
[1:38:19] know, it's it's a lot better to live me
[1:38:21] one than it is to preach me one. I
[1:38:22] believe because because I can see your
[1:38:24] life. God looks at our lives and the
[1:38:27] world looks at our lives because he
[1:38:29] wants to know what our lives are. And
[1:38:31] people know us. No matter our actions is
[1:38:34] so loud it drowns our testimony.
[1:38:37] Depends on what we say. If we are
[1:38:39] Christians and don't live it, then the
[1:38:41] people know better. But when we are
[1:38:43] Christians and say we're Christians and
[1:38:44] live like Christians, our lives will do
[1:38:46] it if we never said nothing else. Our
[1:38:50] lives were written epistles read of all
[1:38:52] men. So they watch how you walk.
[1:38:58] In 1959 in
[1:39:01] dedication of the building to the Lord,
[1:39:03] he says here coming from the courts now
[1:39:05] into the fellowship. Before you can ever
[1:39:08] come into the fellowship of believers,
[1:39:10] you must be cleansed by the blood of
[1:39:11] Christ. No matter how well you know the
[1:39:14] Bible, how well it's been explained to
[1:39:16] you, you must recognize the blood of the
[1:39:18] Lord Jesus and be cleansed and
[1:39:20] sanctified from your world habits.
[1:39:22] Smoking, drinking, gambling, you women
[1:39:24] wearing immoral clothes, you deacons and
[1:39:26] so forth, and church members, drinking,
[1:39:28] smoking cigarettes, playing cards,
[1:39:30] running pool rooms. That's the thing of
[1:39:32] the world. And you've got to be
[1:39:33] separated from that. And there's only
[1:39:35] one thing that can do it. That's change
[1:39:37] your nature. And the blood of Jesus
[1:39:39] Christ is the only thing that can do it.
[1:39:55] Galatians 4 and verse 7.
[1:40:00] Wherefore thou art no more a servant,
[1:40:02] but a son. And if a son, than an heir of
[1:40:05] God through Christ.
[1:40:08] Romans chapter 8. Verse 16.
[1:40:13] The spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:40:15] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:40:17] God. And if children then hes of God and
[1:40:21] joints with Christ, if so be that we
[1:40:24] suffer with him, and that we may also be
[1:40:27] glorified together.
[1:40:32] In the sermon birth pains, brother
[1:40:34] Brandham says, "A little dew drop." I
[1:40:37] don't know the formula of it. Maybe
[1:40:38] there'd be a science here of I'm just
[1:40:40] going to say the way I think it. It
[1:40:42] might be some kind of congested group of
[1:40:44] atmosphere come together in a dark night
[1:40:46] and it falls to the earth and when it
[1:40:48] does it's born in the night, but in the
[1:40:51] morning it's laying there cold and
[1:40:52] shivering on a little blade of grass or
[1:40:54] hanging on your clothesline. But just
[1:40:56] let the sun shine out once. Did you
[1:40:58] notice how happy it get happy it gets?
[1:41:01] It just glistens and quivers. Why? It
[1:41:03] knows that. It knows that it's that
[1:41:06] sunlight is going to draw it back to
[1:41:07] where it was at the beginning. And so,
[1:41:10] as every man or woman that's born of the
[1:41:12] spirit of God, there's something about
[1:41:14] it when light spreads over us that we're
[1:41:16] happy because we're knowing go we know
[1:41:19] we're going back to where we come from
[1:41:21] from the bosom of God.
[1:41:27] Where did we come from?
[1:41:30] Who am I?
[1:41:32] Where am I going after I die?
[1:41:37] In one way, these seem like the simplest
[1:41:40] questions
[1:41:42] because they are in a lot of ways,
[1:41:46] well, it's like I said earlier, they're
[1:41:47] the basis of every religion that's out
[1:41:50] there.
[1:41:52] Most every philosophy that's out there
[1:41:55] is trying to answer those three
[1:41:58] questions.
[1:42:01] And yet God in his scripture is telling
[1:42:03] us very clearly, hey,
[1:42:06] I made everything. I made all the world
[1:42:08] around you and I made you.
[1:42:13] And I created you for a purpose. I
[1:42:16] called you for a reason. I selected you
[1:42:20] because I have something for you to do.
[1:42:24] I have something for you to accomplish.
[1:42:26] I have a purpose.
[1:42:29] You're not just here to wander through
[1:42:31] life and
[1:42:33] who knows what.
[1:42:35] You're not just here to focus on your
[1:42:38] own enjoyment or your own pleasure.
[1:42:39] You're not just here for no reason.
[1:42:45] And you're not junk that I just throw
[1:42:47] away when you die. I paid a price for
[1:42:50] you so that you can raise from the dead
[1:42:53] so that I can wipe away every tear. I
[1:42:56] can take away every hurt. I can take
[1:42:57] away every pain and I can have you with
[1:43:00] me.
[1:43:03] Because ultimately before you were in
[1:43:07] human form, before you were in this
[1:43:09] physical world,
[1:43:12] you were in the mind of God.
[1:43:15] And we're going back to where we came
[1:43:17] from.
[1:43:22] Satan wants to tell us that we're
[1:43:24] unimportant. Satan wants to tell us that
[1:43:26] we don't matter.
[1:43:30] Satan wants to tell us that we're junk,
[1:43:31] that we're trash, failures.
[1:43:35] I'm sure every one of us can run through
[1:43:37] the list of what Satan has tried to tell
[1:43:39] us,
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; if not just today, than just this past
[1:43:43] week.
[1:43:47] But yet, through all of it, God keeps
[1:43:48] saying over and over, "You're mine.
[1:43:53] I made you.
[1:43:55] I called you. What the entire world is
[1:43:58] looking for, what the entire world is
[1:44:00] searching for as they're trying to
[1:44:04] answer these questions to give
[1:44:07] themselves a reason for being here.
[1:44:12] God is saying over and over, you're
[1:44:14] mine.
[1:44:21] We come from God.
[1:44:24] God places us here for a purpose. To be
[1:44:27] his representatives, to be his
[1:44:30] ambassadors, to be his children on this
[1:44:33] world, to be his hands and feet
[1:44:35] operating in this world. And then he
[1:44:38] calls us back to him,
[1:44:41] back to be at his side.
[1:44:47] That's the purpose of our lives. That's
[1:44:49] the purpose of why we're here. That's
[1:44:51] the purpose of why he brought us here.
[1:44:56] That's the purpose of our lives. That's
[1:44:58] the purpose of why we're here. That's
[1:45:00] the purpose of why he
[1:45:03] and that's
[1:45:09] about his purpose in our lives
[1:45:13] because it doesn't end
[1:45:16] in this physical realm. It doesn't end
[1:45:20] in this room or on this earth,
[1:45:23] but we go back to where we came from.
[1:45:27] As the musicians come,
[1:45:30] brother Brandham says in the fundamental
[1:45:33] foundation for faith.
[1:45:36] Now God when he made man in the
[1:45:38] beginning, he made him superior to
[1:45:40] anything on earth. He gave him the
[1:45:43] jurisdiction of everything on earth to
[1:45:44] control everything. He controlled the
[1:45:47] animal life. He controlled the foul
[1:45:48] life, the fishes of the sea. He
[1:45:50] controlled the winds. He controlled the
[1:45:52] plant life. He controlled everything.
[1:45:55] Man was made as a secondary god on
[1:45:57] earth. He was given the power to control
[1:45:59] it all things, all elements of the
[1:46:00] earth, that was Adam. Adam was given
[1:46:02] these great powers. But then the power
[1:46:04] that he was given to make his choices
[1:46:06] where he fell.
[1:46:08] Adam could speak to the winds and it
[1:46:10] would stop. He could speak to the trees
[1:46:11] and they would obey him. He could speak
[1:46:12] to the wildlife, it would obey him. He
[1:46:14] could speak to the waters, ever what it
[1:46:16] was. Everything obeyed Adam. Now that is
[1:46:19] the beginning of man. That's what God
[1:46:21] gave him. Power over everything on
[1:46:22] earth. Now through the fall he lost that
[1:46:25] power. Then he became unconscious of the
[1:46:28] fact after losing his relationship and
[1:46:30] friendship fellowship with the father.
[1:46:32] Then he lost that and all of his great
[1:46:35] channels became clogged up and he
[1:46:37] couldn't get through.
[1:46:39] Now what Adam was in God Christ has
[1:46:41] redeemed us back to that. Now a redeemer
[1:46:45] to redeem anything is to bring it back
[1:46:47] to its origin again. And Adam never had
[1:46:50] to be sick. He never had to die. He
[1:46:53] never had a worry. He never had a
[1:46:54] heartache. He never had fear. He just
[1:46:57] climbed up in the arms of the father.
[1:46:59] And just like a child, everything was
[1:47:01] his. And whatever he asked, well, he
[1:47:03] just got it. Everything obeyed him
[1:47:05] because he was God's child and the child
[1:47:07] is heir of all things.
[1:47:09] Now when man fell, he lost this. And now
[1:47:12] what he lost in the fall, Christ comes
[1:47:14] as a redeemer.
[1:47:16] Did you ever stop to think what Christ
[1:47:18] redeemed us for?
[1:47:20] He gave us everlasting life. He brought
[1:47:23] us back to the eternal fellowship and
[1:47:25] relationship to God to be his sons and
[1:47:28] daughters again to restore back all that
[1:47:31] Adam lost in the fall.
[1:47:37] It's all too easy for us to
[1:47:41] get wrapped up in our own lives. It's
[1:47:45] all too easy for us to get wrapped up in
[1:47:49] our own wants, our own desires, our own
[1:47:53] goals, our own dreams, our own
[1:47:58] take your pick.
[1:48:03] And God doesn't,
[1:48:05] like I said, God doesn't tell us that
[1:48:06] it's wrong for us to set a goal and try
[1:48:09] to work towards it.
[1:48:11] God doesn't tell us that it's wrong for
[1:48:12] us to say, "Man, I want to work towards
[1:48:15] this and accomplish this."
[1:48:18] But at the same time, God calls us for a
[1:48:21] purpose. And often he will deviate us
[1:48:24] away from what we thought was the goal
[1:48:28] to what we thought was the dream, what
[1:48:31] we thought this is where I'm going to
[1:48:34] end up. And God goes, "That was the
[1:48:38] start of the journey.
[1:48:40] I wanted you to start working along that
[1:48:42] route,
[1:48:43] but then I decided to steer you this
[1:48:45] direction.
[1:48:48] And then you thought, okay, if I'm going
[1:48:50] this direction, then that's got to be
[1:48:51] where I'm going. That's got to be what
[1:48:54] the goal is.
[1:48:56] And then God decided to steer me this
[1:48:58] direction.
[1:49:00] And that's and God decided to steer me
[1:49:02] this direction. And then God turned me
[1:49:05] this way.
[1:49:07] And in the end, we look back and we can
[1:49:11] see how God has guided us through life.
[1:49:14] We can see how God has brought us
[1:49:17] through each step of the way.
[1:49:22] I've had a few opportunities to speak
[1:49:24] with
[1:49:26] brother Ken about some of his life and
[1:49:29] some of his different jobs that he went
[1:49:32] through and how God guided him from,
[1:49:35] hey, you're going to get laid off here
[1:49:37] because I'm going to have you go work
[1:49:38] here and then I'm going to have you get
[1:49:40] laid off here because I'm going to have
[1:49:41] you go work there.
[1:49:45] Now, God never sent him a memo to say,
[1:49:47] "Hey, you're getting laid off because
[1:49:49] I'm moving you this place." God never
[1:49:55] gave him a map saying, "All right,
[1:49:58] you're going to be here this long, and
[1:50:00] then you're going to travel to there,
[1:50:02] and then you're going to travel to
[1:50:03] there."
[1:50:08] those years ago, I probably couldn't
[1:50:11] have asked
[1:50:13] brother Ken if he would end up in Pawne,
[1:50:15] Oklahoma, and he would have said, "Oh,
[1:50:17] yeah, absolutely. I know that's where
[1:50:20] I'm going to end up."
[1:50:24] Nobody could have asked me when I was
[1:50:26] growing up in Florida if I would be in
[1:50:28] Pawne, Oklahoma.
[1:50:31] Now, I'm not at the point where I'm
[1:50:34] going, "Hey, I know for sure this where
[1:50:36] I'm going to be till the end.
[1:50:38] God could steer me somewhere else.
[1:50:44] That's up to him.
[1:50:47] But if this is where he's put me right
[1:50:49] now, if this is where he's placed me,
[1:50:52] then there's a purpose.
[1:50:54] God's placed me here for a reason.
[1:51:01] I didn't start ministering until I was
[1:51:05] in Pawnie, Oklahoma.
[1:51:07] I didn't learn to play the guitar until
[1:51:10] I was in Pawnie, Oklahoma.
[1:51:13] My son didn't learn to play the guitar
[1:51:16] and get good enough that he could play
[1:51:18] in church until we were in Pawnie,
[1:51:21] Oklahoma.
[1:51:23] There was a purpose.
[1:51:28] Now, that doesn't mean that as I stand
[1:51:30] here, I can go, I know the purpose for
[1:51:32] the rest of my life of what God's going
[1:51:34] to do.
[1:51:36] We can go through, we could talk about
[1:51:38] life after life
[1:51:41] of people that man, I was brought to
[1:51:42] here and maybe I thought that's where I
[1:51:44] was going to end up staying
[1:51:47] and then get God decided to pull me over
[1:51:49] here. God decided to do this with me or
[1:51:52] do that with me.
[1:51:56] God took
[1:51:59] a boy from Pennsylvania,
[1:52:03] had him serve in World War II,
[1:52:06] moved down to Florida,
[1:52:10] meet a Florida girl that had never left
[1:52:13] the state and other than a brief trip,
[1:52:15] has still never left the state and plans
[1:52:17] to never leave the state
[1:52:22] and have them have children.
[1:52:25] And then have that boy that was born in
[1:52:28] Florida meet a girl that was born in
[1:52:31] Texas, but they met in Alabama.
[1:52:36] And then they end up moving to Oklahoma.
[1:52:42] God doesn't map things out the way that
[1:52:44] we would. We would look at these and go,
[1:52:46] "God, this would be a lot more simple if
[1:52:49] we just like, could I just meet a local
[1:52:51] girl?
[1:52:53] Hey, I'm in Florida. Can I just meet a
[1:52:54] Florida girl and we'll just not do all
[1:52:57] this moving around and all this back and
[1:52:59] forth? And
[1:53:01] I mean, yeah, I married a Texas girl.
[1:53:03] That Texas girl left Texas, moved to
[1:53:05] South Carolina, and then had to move
[1:53:07] from South Carolina to Alabama where I
[1:53:09] finally got to meet her.
[1:53:13] And then we end up in Oklahoma.
[1:53:18] And we end up in Oklahoma
[1:53:21] meeting up with friends that she's known
[1:53:24] from Texas and from South Carolina and
[1:53:27] from these different places.
[1:53:30] And somehow we gather in Oklahoma.
[1:53:36] That's just my life.
[1:53:39] That's not going through the stories of
[1:53:42] others that have moved from
[1:53:46] Seattle and Alaska and
[1:53:51] all across the country
[1:53:53] to meet this guy and this girl have to
[1:53:57] get together.
[1:54:01] Robert, where all have you lived?
[1:54:08] Idaho, Alaska, Seattle. Brianna, where
[1:54:11] all have you lived?
[1:54:16] Georgia, South Carolina, New Mexico,
[1:54:18] Oklahoma.
[1:54:21] God takes these two people
[1:54:24] that most people would look at and go,
[1:54:25] "There is zero chance that they will
[1:54:27] ever meet.
[1:54:30] There is zero chance that they will ever
[1:54:33] rub shoulders together.
[1:54:38] and brings them through and brings them
[1:54:41] both to Ponyie, Oklahoma
[1:54:46] to bring this couple together.
[1:54:51] God's ways are not our ways.
[1:54:55] God's purposes
[1:54:57] are not ours.
[1:55:01] But yet at the same time, God still
[1:55:03] created us for a purpose. He created
[1:55:07] Robert and Brianna for a purpose. And he
[1:55:09] had them go through different things in
[1:55:10] their lives. He had them go through
[1:55:12] different experiences
[1:55:14] to finally bring them to this place.
[1:55:19] God took my wife and I through different
[1:55:21] experiences,
[1:55:23] sitting under different pastors, living
[1:55:25] in different states
[1:55:27] to finally come to where we are here.
[1:55:31] And God's not done with us.
[1:55:35] Now, God could be planning on us staying
[1:55:37] in Pawne and he works with us here for
[1:55:40] the next, Lord willing, just until the
[1:55:43] rapture comes. I don't want to talk
[1:55:44] years. Let's just go till just till the
[1:55:45] rapture comes.
[1:55:48] But God could also go in a year or two
[1:55:51] and go, "Hey, it's time for you to go
[1:55:53] somewhere else.
[1:55:56] That's not for me to decide.
[1:56:00] What is for me to decide is to keep
[1:56:03] living for him and trusting him and
[1:56:06] doing my best to follow the path that he
[1:56:09] lays out before me.
[1:56:11] Whatever that might be.
[1:56:14] Doesn't mean it's going to be easy.
[1:56:17] But yet, God has created us with a
[1:56:20] purpose.
[1:56:23] God has created my wife with specific
[1:56:25] talents and specific
[1:56:27] skills, specific abilities,
[1:56:31] that she's able to take care of the kids
[1:56:34] in a way I never would. That she's able
[1:56:36] to take care of our home in a way that I
[1:56:39] never could.
[1:56:40] That she's able to correct me in ways
[1:56:44] that I need sometimes.
[1:56:50] God paired us together. to this Florida
[1:56:53] boy and Texas girl
[1:56:56] to bring us through the different
[1:56:57] challenges and the different things that
[1:56:59] we've dealt with so that we could come
[1:57:02] here and
[1:57:04] work
[1:57:07] and be a part and
[1:57:12] put our shoulder to the wheel in some
[1:57:13] way
[1:57:16] and speak a word of encouragement here
[1:57:19] or
[1:57:21] say something to somebody at work there.
[1:57:24] Do these different things
[1:57:28] because none of us are junk.
[1:57:35] Brother Patrick,
[1:57:38] he's brought you through a lot of things
[1:57:39] over the years.
[1:57:42] You've gone through a lot of
[1:57:45] a lot of things and I don't even know
[1:57:47] them all. And that's fine. I don't want
[1:57:49] to
[1:57:54] But yet, God has brought you to this
[1:57:56] point.
[1:57:59] And God has brought you to this point.
[1:58:00] And
[1:58:02] Satan would want to tell you, "Hey,
[1:58:04] you're sitting here and
[1:58:06] you're not really worth anything. You
[1:58:08] don't really have any prospects. You
[1:58:09] don't really have any future."
[1:58:13] And yet God is sitting here telling you,
[1:58:16] "I made you for a purpose."
[1:58:19] And hey,
[1:58:21] you might have made some bad choices.
[1:58:24] You might have gone down the wrong road
[1:58:25] a few times. You might have done the
[1:58:27] wrong thing a few times,
[1:58:31] maybe more than a few.
[1:58:34] But yet,
[1:58:37] God doesn't make junk.
[1:58:40] God doesn't make trash.
[1:58:43] Even as you're sitting here and
[1:58:46] maybe you don't know exactly what the
[1:58:48] next step is going to be. Maybe you
[1:58:50] don't know what the next thing that you
[1:58:53] can do is. Maybe you don't know
[1:58:57] what the right choice you're going to be
[1:58:59] to be able to provide for a family and
[1:59:02] take care of children or do these
[1:59:05] different things.
[1:59:08] But yet God still is sitting there
[1:59:10] going,
[1:59:12] "I made you. I called you. And I have a
[1:59:17] purpose for you."
[1:59:20] But you have to be willing to surrender
[1:59:22] yourself to what that purpose is.
[1:59:26] You can't be the plate that wants to be
[1:59:28] used like a coffee mug. You can't be the
[1:59:31] coffee mug that wants to have someone
[1:59:33] eat steak out of you. You can't be
[1:59:37] something that you're not created to be.
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:42] God has placed us here.
[1:59:46] God's placed us here in Panee at this
[1:59:49] moment for a reason.
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:54] There's a different reason for each one
[1:59:56] of us. There's a different purpose for
[1:59:58] each one of us.
[2:00:01] But we're not junk.
[2:00:03] We're not trash.
[2:00:07] And whatever our lives may have looked
[2:00:09] like, whatever we may have struggled
[2:00:11] through, whatever we may have dealt with
[2:00:13] in the past,
[2:00:17] God's just calling for us to surrender.
[2:00:21] And God's calling for us to be willing
[2:00:24] to be used the way he wants us to be
[2:00:26] used.
[2:00:29] Not to wish that we were some other
[2:00:33] dish, that we were some other vessel. To
[2:00:35] wish that we had some other talents or
[2:00:38] some other abilities or
[2:00:40] some other background,
[2:00:46] but to be willing to surrender and go,
[2:00:49] Lord, you made me.
[2:00:51] Lord, you made everything
[2:00:53] and you chose me. You selected me.
[2:00:57] You called me as your child
[2:01:01] and you've given me a promise of a
[2:01:03] future.
[2:01:06] So Lord, I'm just here for you to use.
[2:01:10] However that might be, whatever form
[2:01:12] that may take,
[2:01:16] I'm here for you to use me.
[2:01:21] Maybe small, maybe big. That's up to God
[2:01:25] to decide.
[2:01:29] But all we can do and all that God calls
[2:01:32] us to do is to surrender.
[2:01:41] What are you playing? Sister
[2:01:47] [Music]
[2:01:49] will hear. The coming of the Lord is
[2:01:53] near. living out the revelation,
[2:01:59] overcoming sin's temptation. The truth
[2:02:03] will go to every tongue and nation.
[2:02:12] We are the generation.
[2:02:16] [Music]
[2:02:20] We are the generation.
[2:02:25] We're the culmination. The final voice
[2:02:30] the world will hear. The coming of the
[2:02:34] Lord is near. Living out the revelation.
[2:02:41] Overcoming sins temptation. And the
[2:02:44] truth will go to every tongue and
[2:02:48] nation.
[2:02:53] We are the chosen generation.
[2:03:03] You know, I've
[2:03:06] had to do a lot of thinking and a lot of
[2:03:09] looking as I've gone into the new job
[2:03:12] I've had over the last
[2:03:16] month and a half, seven, eight weeks,
[2:03:19] whatever it is now.
[2:03:22] And I've had multiple conversations with
[2:03:24] my wife talking about
[2:03:27] the other people that I work with and
[2:03:29] the way that pretty much everybody
[2:03:32] there, they have two income households
[2:03:35] because they've got I work with almost
[2:03:37] all the pretty much everybody I work
[2:03:39] with is women. Their husbands work as
[2:03:41] well. They work
[2:03:44] and they'll talk about the houses they
[2:03:46] own and this that or the other. And none
[2:03:48] of them are wealthy. None of them are
[2:03:50] rich.
[2:03:52] But yet when they talk about the
[2:03:54] different things that that they have,
[2:03:56] the different things that they're able
[2:03:57] to do,
[2:03:59] and I sit there looking at my own
[2:04:01] finances going, there is no way I could
[2:04:03] ever afford to do that or afford to do
[2:04:06] this because
[2:04:09] this is the choice that we've made
[2:04:11] because this is what God has called us
[2:04:14] to do.
[2:04:15] God has called us to make the choice
[2:04:17] that
[2:04:19] my wife stays home and takes care of the
[2:04:20] kids and takes care of the home and we
[2:04:24] don't have the second income that the
[2:04:26] world seems to be built around anymore.
[2:04:31] And it can get easy to start to slip
[2:04:34] into a mindset of going, man, I wish
[2:04:37] that we could have a nicer house like
[2:04:41] that. I wish that we could do that. I
[2:04:44] wish that we could afford to go on a
[2:04:47] vacation. I wish that we could afford to
[2:04:49] do this or do that or take your pick of
[2:04:51] what it is.
[2:04:53] It's easy to fall into that trap.
[2:04:59] And I haven't been there that long. And
[2:05:00] it's easy for me to begin to fall into
[2:05:02] that trap to go, "Wow,
[2:05:05] they seem to have
[2:05:08] better than we do. They seem to have be
[2:05:11] in a better place.
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:17] But yet God's calling me and calling my
[2:05:20] family to be used in a certain way
[2:05:24] to work this certain job to live the way
[2:05:27] that we live. And
[2:05:30] if God wanted me to have the money to go
[2:05:33] do all these things, I would have it. If
[2:05:36] God wanted me to have the resources to
[2:05:39] go do this or do that, I would have
[2:05:41] them.
[2:05:44] But God hasn't called me for that.
[2:05:47] And I don't have a right to sit there
[2:05:50] and wish that I had what they do.
[2:05:55] As easy it is for me to do it because
[2:05:58] that's the mindset of the world. That's
[2:06:00] the mindset of Leodysia to look and go,
[2:06:03] "Man, I wish that I had a little more.
[2:06:08] I wish that I could live as good as they
[2:06:10] do. I wish that I had that new car or I
[2:06:12] wish I had that new phone or I had this
[2:06:15] this this to
[2:06:17] go through the list of it.
[2:06:24] But what I I was talking with my son the
[2:06:28] other night and he's voiced multiple
[2:06:30] times that he wishes that we could have
[2:06:32] a house big enough that he could have
[2:06:34] his own room and not have to be sharing
[2:06:38] with his brother and have bunk beds and
[2:06:39] this that wishing that he could have his
[2:06:42] own room.
[2:06:45] And I was talking with him the other
[2:06:46] night and we were talking about the fact
[2:06:49] that he had been struggling a little bit
[2:06:51] with feeling a little bit isolated.
[2:06:54] Typical the typical teenage thing.
[2:06:57] There's nothing odd about this, but
[2:07:00] feeling like I don't have as much time
[2:07:02] with my friends. My friends are too
[2:07:03] busy. I'm I'm the oddball in the group.
[2:07:06] I don't fit in. I don't this that or the
[2:07:08] other.
[2:07:10] And he's too much like me because I did
[2:07:12] the exact same thing at his age.
[2:07:16] But I sat there and I asked and I said,
[2:07:19] "Do you really think
[2:07:22] as much as you can get into your head
[2:07:24] and feel isolated
[2:07:27] when you're in a crowded house with all
[2:07:30] your brothers and sisters around you? Do
[2:07:32] you really think it would be a good
[2:07:34] thing if God gave us a house big enough
[2:07:36] that you could actually be isolated in
[2:07:38] your room all by yourself?"
[2:07:43] And he sat there for a minute and then
[2:07:46] finally was like
[2:07:48] maybe not.
[2:07:55] And that could be
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:07:58] at least part of the reason that God has
[2:08:00] me the way that I am and where I'm at.
[2:08:03] God hasn't given me more because he
[2:08:06] knows what my kids need.
[2:08:09] He hasn't given me more because he knows
[2:08:10] what I can handle. He hasn't given me
[2:08:12] more because he wants me to be in this
[2:08:15] place to maybe speak to this person.
[2:08:21] I can't be sitting there and
[2:08:24] going, "Man, Lord, why am I just a plain
[2:08:27] clay pot? Why can't I be a nice crystal
[2:08:29] vase?
[2:08:31] Why can't I be this this valuable piece?
[2:08:34] Why do I just have to be the plain
[2:08:37] beaten pewer mug or whatever?
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:42] But yet, God has made me this way. And
[2:08:45] God's made me that way for a reason.
[2:08:48] And I may struggle with the why now and
[2:08:50] then. I may struggle with, "Lord, I
[2:08:52] don't understand."
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:08:57] But God just called me to surrender.
[2:09:00] God called me to surrender and be
[2:09:02] willing to be used for what I'm made
[2:09:06] for.
[2:09:08] And he'll handle the rest. He's promised
[2:09:11] that he'll make sure there's food on the
[2:09:14] table. He'll make sure we have a roof
[2:09:18] over our heads.
[2:09:21] He'll make sure since I live so far away
[2:09:24] from church, I'm going to have a vehicle
[2:09:26] that I can get back and forth from.
[2:09:28] And God has showed himself faithful time
[2:09:30] and time again when my car broke down or
[2:09:33] when different things that he still
[2:09:36] provided to make sure that we could get
[2:09:39] to church
[2:09:41] or he's made sure that we could get
[2:09:43] food.
[2:09:46] You know, there when we first moved
[2:09:48] here, there were times we went down to
[2:09:50] the food bank.
[2:09:52] I didn't really like going there,
[2:09:55] but yet we qualified. They made sure we
[2:09:59] had food.
[2:10:02] I'll be the first one to say as soon as
[2:10:04] I was making enough, we didn't go
[2:10:06] anymore.
[2:10:09] But yet, at the same time, God's
[2:10:10] provided.
[2:10:13] Maybe he made me be a little more humble
[2:10:14] sometimes. Maybe he made me be willing
[2:10:18] to take a little bit of help now and
[2:10:20] then.
[2:10:23] But he still provided every step of the
[2:10:25] way. And he'll still provide for each
[2:10:27] one of us. He's just calling us to
[2:10:31] surrender, to be used for what he made
[2:10:34] us to be used for.
[2:10:42] The coming of the Lord is near. Giving
[2:10:47] out the revelation,
[2:10:51] overcoming sin, temptation. The truth
[2:10:55] will go to every tongue and nation.
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:03] We are the chosen generation.
[2:11:09] as our pastor comes. We are the
[2:11:13] generation
[2:11:16] with a combination
[2:11:19] of voice.
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:37] every congreation.
[2:11:41] [Music]
[2:11:43] We are the chosen generation.
[2:11:48] Aren't you glad that you're that chosen
[2:11:50] generation?
[2:11:51] Hallelujah.
[2:11:53] That chosen generation.
[2:11:56] Praise the Lord. And I want to be, Amen.
[2:11:59] a genuine worshipper
[2:12:02] of that great God, Jehovah. Amen.
[2:12:06] There's only one religion that has uh
[2:12:09] that has been proven to be true. Amen.
[2:12:13] You know, you you as he was going
[2:12:15] through Islam and Buddha and and uh the
[2:12:19] Darwin evolution, the different the
[2:12:22] different philosophies out there. Amen.
[2:12:26] But there is one that has been proven to
[2:12:28] be true. There's been one that has
[2:12:30] proven uh the founder that has died, has
[2:12:35] raised from the dead, and he is alive
[2:12:37] ever more to let you know. And and in
[2:12:40] this generation, God came back as he
[2:12:43] promised he would. And again, he said
[2:12:46] before he come that he would send a
[2:12:49] messenger, a prophet messenger that
[2:12:52] would that would bring that word and and
[2:12:55] God would discern the hearts and he
[2:12:58] would prophesy and predict. What was he
[2:13:01] doing? He was showing that that God is
[2:13:04] alive and well today. Can you say amen?
[2:13:08] The word the word of God is is uh Amen.
[2:13:13] It's it it's it's it's it's discerning.
[2:13:16] It knows. Amen. And we're so thankful
[2:13:19] for that. You you think of you you think
[2:13:21] of the Bible. Amen. There's 40 different
[2:13:24] authors authors in in the in the Holy
[2:13:26] Bible. New Testament, Old Testament.
[2:13:28] Most of these writers never even knew
[2:13:30] each other. And and yet you can't find a
[2:13:35] contradiction in the Bible. The the span
[2:13:37] of the Bible being written was over a
[2:13:40] span of 1500 years. And here God's word,
[2:13:45] amen, just all joins right in there
[2:13:48] together. Who else could say 800 years
[2:13:51] before it happened, a virgin shall
[2:13:53] conceive,
[2:13:54] 800 years later, the virgin conceived.
[2:13:57] And then a step further saying that the
[2:14:00] that the boy would be born in Bethlehem.
[2:14:04] And then even go further than that. I
[2:14:06] mean, you can you can go all the way
[2:14:08] through and how that just just uh uh
[2:14:12] every prophecy has come to pass even to
[2:14:15] this day what God said that this day
[2:14:17] would be like and here we are. So, you
[2:14:19] know, that that should give us that
[2:14:21] should give us a a great assurance to
[2:14:24] say, you know what, I'm going to I'm
[2:14:26] going to put my life behind this. I'm
[2:14:28] going to believe it with all of my
[2:14:30] heart. Amen. And uh and so I'm I'm so
[2:14:34] thankful for that here today. Amen. I I
[2:14:38] I I'm want to it it's worth giving my
[2:14:40] all to. Giving my giving everything I've
[2:14:43] got. Give it to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:14:46] And so uh we we enjoyed the word of the
[2:14:48] Lord. Did you enjoy that tonight?
[2:14:53] Let the worshippers arise.
[2:14:57] [Music]
[2:15:01] Let the sons and the daughters see
[2:15:08] I'm surrender in my hall.

[2:15:20] worshippers arise.
[2:15:24] Hallelu.
[2:15:27] Let the sons and the daughters see.
[2:15:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm surrendering
[2:15:38] my all.
[2:15:42] I surrender to
[2:15:45] the king.
[2:15:48] Father, I see it growing louder.
[2:15:52] The song of your redeemed
[2:15:55] as the saints from every nation
[2:16:00] awakening to sing from our heart the
[2:16:04] groans an anthem.
[2:16:07] Oh hear the heavens ring. This is my
[2:16:11] song
[2:16:13] my song to the king. Worshippers arise.
[2:16:23] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:16:31] I'm surrendering
[2:16:33] my all.
[2:16:38] I surrender to the king.
[2:16:43] Father, I see the bride rejoicing
[2:16:48] in a song of victory.
[2:16:51] Every chain of death is broken
[2:16:55] and they have been set free. Satan's
[2:16:59] kingdom is defeated.
[2:17:02] Oh, let
[2:17:04] bring praise to our Lord.
[2:17:08] Praise to our king. Worshippers arise.
[2:17:18] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:17:22] I love you. I love you.
[2:17:25] I'm surrendering
[2:17:27] my all.
[2:17:30] [Music]
[2:17:32] I surrender to the king.
[2:17:38] Amen. What What's that third verse? Is
[2:17:41] it see the bride rejoicing
[2:17:45] in a song of victory
[2:17:49] every chain of death
[2:17:53] and they
[2:17:55] Satan's
[2:17:57] kingdom is defeated.
[2:18:00] Oh, all heavens bring our our Lord.
[2:18:06] Praise to our King,
[2:18:10] worshipers arise.
[2:18:12] [Music]
[2:18:16] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:18:20] Halleluah. Halleluah.
[2:18:23] I'm surrendering
[2:18:25] my all.
[2:18:30] I'm surrender to the king.
[2:18:37] [Music]
[2:18:38] Hallelujah.
[2:18:40] Hallelujah.
[2:18:42] Glory to God. Glory to God. Things do
[2:18:46] not Amen. Materialistic things does not
[2:18:49] define a man. And it's never meant to
[2:18:51] define a man. The night, the car you
[2:18:54] drive, the house you live in, the
[2:18:56] clothes you wear is never to define you.
[2:19:00] Amen. It never never it should never
[2:19:03] define. You should never judge a man by
[2:19:06] what he's got on. Amen. By by what uh by
[2:19:10] what kind of a car he drives. You don't
[2:19:13] you don't judge people by what they own.
[2:19:16] You judge a man by his character. you
[2:19:19] judge a woman by their character. And uh
[2:19:23] uh if that was the case, Amen. John the
[2:19:27] Baptist, John the Baptist was a very
[2:19:29] poor man. He was a poor man. And and he
[2:19:33] lived in a wilderness. John the Baptist.
[2:19:36] He he came out eating honey and wild
[2:19:39] locust. Amen. He was dressed in in in uh
[2:19:43] in sheep skin and and uh uh Amen. He did
[2:19:49] not have good he did not have hygiene
[2:19:52] ethics. Amen. The pro the prophet says
[2:19:56] he didn't take baths often at all. And
[2:19:59] uh uh he and the people look and the
[2:20:03] people looked at that man and rejected
[2:20:06] him. Amen. and he was the prophet. He
[2:20:10] was the prophet to introduce Jesus
[2:20:14] Christ. So you you don't look at at at
[2:20:18] somebody's status in the community or
[2:20:21] you don't look at and say, "Well, you
[2:20:23] know that that's a poor man, so he don't
[2:20:25] have nothing to offer." Well, this one
[2:20:28] here, he's he's you know, he's a wealthy
[2:20:30] man. He's got something that has that we
[2:20:33] we seen the other night Jesus said,
[2:20:35] "Amen. It'd be easier for a camel to go
[2:20:38] through the eye of a needle uh uh than
[2:20:40] it would be for a rich man to make
[2:20:42] heaven.
[2:20:44] Hallelujah. So, so we we got to see
[2:20:48] things in the right order. And and uh u
[2:20:52] but the but the correct decision as as
[2:20:54] as brother Harry was saying, you you
[2:20:57] look at what decision that he and his
[2:20:59] wife has made and the impact it is
[2:21:02] having on their children. You've made
[2:21:04] the right decision. It's your children
[2:21:06] that are going to be serving the Lord.
[2:21:09] Amen. The two family thing or the two,
[2:21:12] you know, the the the two uh uh uh
[2:21:16] people working, it it hurts the family.
[2:21:20] And so, uh I I I think I think that's a
[2:21:24] wonderful thing that that he brought up.
[2:21:26] I would rather have nothing here on this
[2:21:30] earth and have eternal blessings and
[2:21:33] bliss on the other side. That's right.
[2:21:36] And that's what we are preparing for.
[2:21:40] Amen. And there's nothing wrong with
[2:21:42] having money. I'm not saying that it.
[2:21:43] And listen, there there, you know, I
[2:21:45] there there's a lot of men that have a
[2:21:48] lot of money and they they have sent uh
[2:21:50] spread the gospel, helped spread the
[2:21:52] gospel all over the world. And we
[2:21:53] appreciate those men. Amen. But I I I I
[2:21:57] I'm the Lord knows that I couldn't
[2:22:00] handle all of it. So, he just kept me
[2:22:02] pretty simple. And uh and and I'm I'm
[2:22:05] I'm happy being simple. Amen. Praise the
[2:22:07] Lord. And uh uh but I I I just want to
[2:22:11] let you all know and every one of you uh
[2:22:14] Brother Harry made it said it several
[2:22:16] times. God doesn't make junk.
[2:22:19] He doesn't make junk. Hallelujah. And I
[2:22:22] don't care who would look down on uh on
[2:22:26] on anyone in our congregation. You know,
[2:22:29] maybe someone in the community or
[2:22:30] someone listen, I it doesn't matter who
[2:22:33] looks down on who. What matters is is
[2:22:36] your name is represented in heaven and
[2:22:39] you've got of the lamb of God. Jesus
[2:22:43] Christ is representing you. and he so
[2:22:46] loved you and saw it fit to bring you to
[2:22:49] the to him and to the church and to find
[2:22:52] and and teaching you who you are. Amen.
[2:22:55] We be you come to church every week and
[2:22:57] the Holy Spirit is just service after
[2:22:59] service teaching you who you are to to
[2:23:02] to rise you up, give you a greater
[2:23:04] faith. That's why we come to church.
[2:23:05] Amen. We're coming up higher and higher
[2:23:07] and higher. Amen. Understanding who we
[2:23:10] are in Christ. Hallelujah. I might not
[2:23:13] have the biggest standing in the
[2:23:14] community, but I've got a great big
[2:23:16] standing in heaven. I guarantee you. And
[2:23:19] that's what I am pressing for. Amen.
[2:23:23] Hallelujah. Well, can I hear an amen?
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And and that's what we're
[2:23:29] pressing on. Amen. Praise the Lord.

[2:29:14] our sister Denise, Lord, and the
[2:29:17] blessings that she has been to us over
[2:29:21] the years, Lord. What an incredible
[2:29:24] blessing that she and Sister Brother
[2:29:27] Mike has been to us. Lord, Satan has
[2:29:31] just hit her every which direction,
[2:29:33] Lord. And I know sometimes it's
[2:29:37] Lord, that doesn't mean that she doesn't
[2:29:39] have a faith. That doesn't mean that
[2:29:41] you're not hearing her. It just simply
[2:29:44] means, Lord, that she that the devil may
[2:29:47] know that that she has something eternal
[2:29:50] on the inside that he's trying to wear
[2:29:52] down and get to.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have sealed us with your
[2:29:57] spirit and there's nothing that the
[2:29:58] enemy can do. And Satan, you have tried
[2:30:01] and you've tried, but you have lost and
[2:30:03] you will lose.
[2:30:06] We command you to leave her and loosen
[2:30:09] her, God. I'm asking that you would
[2:30:12] bring healing to her, Lord. Lord, that
[2:30:15] cancer that's that's Lord, in her in in
[2:30:18] her female organs, Lord, and then in her
[2:30:21] glands. Lord, I I'm just asking for
[2:30:24] these lymph nodes. I'm asking, Father,
[2:30:27] that you would that you would cause this
[2:30:30] cancer to be contained, that this cancer
[2:30:33] would be taken out,
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, and that you would just totally
[2:30:38] destroy those cancer cells.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, I'm thanking you for your
[2:30:46] grace and your mercy. And Lord, I'm
[2:30:48] asking that you would give the doctors
[2:30:50] wisdom.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, give them skill. Lord, be with the
[2:30:54] nurses. Lord, may there be a hand of of
[2:30:58] of the Lord that reaches down and upon
[2:31:02] each one of them. Lord, guide them,
[2:31:05] direct them, give them, Lord. May they
[2:31:10] take special uh uh uh notice, Lord, and
[2:31:14] and work very hard, Father. Now, Father,
[2:31:17] we want to thank you. Now, let your
[2:31:18] angels be all around that operating
[2:31:20] room. Lord, sterilize all of the
[2:31:23] equipment with your holy fire. I pray
[2:31:26] right now that you will just move
[2:31:27] through this. And we thank you right now
[2:31:30] for bringing her out
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; and bringing her through deliverance in
[2:31:34] Jesus name.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; I thank you for it, Father.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.

[2:31:50] Uh and she's not been feeling well and
[2:31:53] and so let's just let's just anoint him
[2:31:55] and pray. Father, Lord, as we lay our
[2:31:59] hands upon brother Donald, God, and we
[2:32:02] are we are he is standing in for his
[2:32:06] wife, Lord, I'm asking that your healing
[2:32:09] hand,
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, would go back to that house, that
[2:32:14] you would heal her, and that you would
[2:32:16] make her totally whole. Satan, you're
[2:32:19] defeated. And
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; God, I'm asking that you would bring her
[2:32:23] out.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; That you would show your wonderful hand.
[2:32:27] I'm asking that you would open the
[2:32:28] shades of her soul, Lord.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Let the sunlight, God's eternal light,
[2:32:33] shine upon her, Lord. Oh, let it bring
[2:32:37] strength to her mind, strength to her
[2:32:39] body. Lord, that you would bring healing
[2:32:42] to her, Father, in her spirit. God, we
[2:32:45] just thank you for it in the name of
[2:32:48] Jesus. Let her know your love that
[2:32:50] passes all understanding
[2:32:52] in Jesus name.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; I thank you for it, Lord.
