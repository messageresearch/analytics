say God bless you and may the Lord open the windows of heaven and pour a blessing out upon New Life Outreach that you all will not even have room enough to receive amen what you've done for the kingdom of God and amen again to all you men of God we we say God bless you and appreciate you I know there's some pastors here tonight that'll be amen slipping away to get back to their congregations

around here somewhere and so we we're sure glad to have them here tonight and do want to say it's good to have brother Mark here God bless you he's aming Minister from the church there and appreciate him for being here and supporting tonight and the Book of St John the 5th chapter we want to look here in the 24th verse of St John 5 verse 24 I love this verse brother brandom uses this many many times and in the 24th verse he says now verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word brother brah changes that to understandeth he that understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation so you're not going to come into condemnation but you have passed from Death unto life I love a prophet's words he said now rub that out if you can amen you're not coming into condemnation because you've already passed from condemnation into life now in the book of Hebrews Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chap 11 and verse number 29 in the great the great chapter of of faith in the book of Hebrews that Paul writes and leaves to the church in Hebrews chap 11 and verse 29 Paul here writing of the history of Israel and in the 29th verse he says Now by faith they passed through the Red Sea by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians assain to do were drowned amen I love that by faith let's say that together by faith they pass through the Red Sea amen we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seat here this afternoon I I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I would if I would take a title tonight or a subject with you I want to speak on this accept and step into what Grace has provided amen accept and step into what Grace has provided you know all these services that we have had I believe they have been here and they have been for the purpose amen of building up and quickening our faith Amen to bring us to a place where we can accept amen what we have come to receive now I want to uh read a quote here to lay a foundation 1963 brother Ram said this in accepting God's provided way at the end time he said you know there is many ways that people take he said but there's really only two ways that a man can go he said that's the right way and that's the wrong way he said and all of us here tonight we're on those roads the right or the wrong one see amen there's no middle ground for Jesus said amen that you cannot serve God and Mammon which he was meaning the world so we're either right amen or we're wrong now if we'll just get away from our own way amen is the only way we can get into God's way amen the only way that we can get into God's way amen is we have got to get out of Our Own Way amen God bless you brother Duran it's good to see you tonight amen the only way we can get out of our way is to get into God's way amen and God has made a provided way for everything he has provided the way and where we get in trouble is not following the way and injecting into it our own way see and that makes a perversion and anything that's perver verted amen is not Dependable anything amen that is perverted is not Dependable amen so God has a way can we establish that right now amen that God has a way I'll say this that man always injects amen his way into God's way I want to go on record and say tonight that God's ways amen they are perfect amen I love what Solomon said in Proverbs 14:12 when he said there is a way amen with which seeth right unto a man amen but the end thereof are the ways of death amen there is a way that seeth right unto man amen but the end thereof are the ways of death so that tells me young people that there is a connection between the way you're in and the destination that you're headed for listen there is a big difference in something that seeth right amen and knowing that something is Right amen I'll say this denominations are walking Amen in the way which seeth right unto a man amen they baptize in a way that seems right unto their Bishop amen they have communion in a way that seeth right amen unto their leaders or unto their unto their unto their presb or under their their their uh what shall I say their jurisdiction amen but I want to tell you young people amen as the Bride of Jesus Christ we are not like denominations amen that are walking without an absolute amen they have to so because they don't have an absolute amen they have to choose which way seems right amen so this way seems right to baptize and this way seems right to receive the Holy Ghost amen but let me go on record tonight and say we're not choosing amen which way is Right amen we are telling you which way is Right amen and the way that's right is the way of God he said see you've got to come amen not the way that seems right amen but the way that God says is Right amen and that is the way of the Cross amen I'll say this we're not not walking without an absolute we are walking with an absolute and anybody that studies what a prophet said he said if you got an absolute you're headed for a paradox amen and you know what a paradox is amen it is something that is incredible it is hard to explain amen it cannot be explained amen but yet it is the truth I want to put every devil and Hell on notice tonight amen that this is not a denominational young people amen that is walking in a way amen that seeth right under some leader hey but this is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she has heard the sermon an absolute and she is walking with an absolute amen and I'm just going to say it we're going to walk right into a miracle tonight we're going to walk right into a paradox tonight I believe there's some young people here tonight amen that's going to walk into a greater hour in their life than they've ever seen before they're going to walk into a victory that they thought would never happen listen I refuse to back up amen and start walking with a way that seems right I have heard amen the sounding of the seventh angel and he said if there's an absolute then it's Unlimited in power and there's nothing it cannot do I want to put every demon of condemnation every demon of guilt every demon of anxiety every demon of cancer every demon of complexes every demon of pornography every demon of perversion I want to put that devil on notice tonight hey we have an absolute and because we have an absolute solute we will not back up to your pressures we will not back up to your fear we know who we are we are the sons and daughters of God and God has positionally placed Us in the way that is right my the way that God says his right is the way of the word he said that's what the Christian needs today in this atomic age in this time of uncertainty you need something besides just experience of joining Church you need an anchor you need an absolute you know because churches will fail and people will fail hey but Christ cannot fail and he is the absolute Amen to the believer well since I got the microphone I might as well just preach amen there was a little idea went around amen that the message is not the absolute amen I'll go ahead and say it amen that is an intellectual idea that's trying to crucify amen the potential of a paradox Amen in this generation listen a prophet said that that woman's absolute was the prophet and he said his absolute was God if you take this prophet's message as your absolute it's the same as taking God as your absolute because this is not the word of a man it's not the Declaration of a bishop it is thus saith the Lord that has been revealed in the hour that we're living in yes sir if you can read in the scripture that's something Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because there some twisting around someone tell you oh that was for the disciples or that's for someone else amen then don't you hold on to that amen if you do amen Christ is not your absolute can I say this he said the person who led you out of the way amen is your absolute but if that word glory to God if that word which is Christ still holds then he is your absolute and we mustn't let anything stir us amen out of the way of the word listen we are not walking in our choice we are walking in God's choice prophet of God said those denominational ages of 900 and something different Protestant denomination each one claims that they are the truth and that they have the truth and that the people that belong to those churches amen they should believe that now listen because they have Stak their Eternal destination upon the teaching of that church and there's so much different one from the other till it makes 900 in something different questions amen every denomination amen creates a question on the word of God he said therefore being 900 and something different questions there's got to be one correct answer and I would like for us tonight being that we're trying to go to heaven and to meet our lord Jesus who we all love amen I would like to search in the scripture Amen to find that answer oh Church of the Living God hey there is a there there is an announcement to be made every person under the sound of my voice amen has a destination and I'll say this as a Believer my destination is not tribulation my destination amen is not hell I did not come from Hell therefore I cannot go back to hell I did not well I might as well preach I have come from God and I must go back to God so that's why I study this message is I want to figure out about the place I'm going I've often told the story I was I was in a meeting one night we got done I had the final service and the brother just got done preaching and the guy come up to me he said brother Andrew he said going to be hard for you to preach in the morning he said after all these preachers you got to find something to say I said well I got the message it's unlimited you know and he said well he said I'll tell you one thing ain't nobody preached on is hell he said you ought to just preach on hell I said well I would but I don't know much about it he said what do you mean you never took time to study it I said why would I waste my time amen trying to figure out about somewhere I ain't never going I didn't come from hell I ain't going back to hell but I do have a sermon called The Rapture and I do have a sermon called things that are to be and I do have a sermon called the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride if I'm going to study anything I'm going to study about the streets of gold that I'm going to walk on if I'm going to study about anything I'm going to study about the Merit supper of the Lamb I want to tell you there's a table and it's a th000 miles long I want to tell you there's a Crystal River I want to tell you the tree of life he is blooming in the land forever I want to tell you you got a seat at the marriage supper of the lamb and there ain't nobody can take your seat it's there and it's sealed and it's predestinated unto you if we're going to study about an answer let's study about where we're going we're going to heaven well we might as well shout that devil out of the building we're going to heaven we're going in the Rapture we're going in the Millennium we're going in the future home we're going where the devil's not going wo Glory we're going church we're going to Glory now the prophet said don't you be afraid no matter how many atomic bombs how many hydrogen bombs how much they speak of this and that's going to happen don't you be scared God's at the will he just knows how to steer amen listen so we don't have one thing to fear but be just a lovely little Carefree child who is looking up to the father every minute and is depending on him to lead us and to guide us now listen to this and to take us into our destination by his grace Oh Glory to God he's going to take us into our destination by our works by our abilities by how much we know or how how much we memorized or what church we go to or who our daddy is or who our pastor is no he's going to take us into our destination by his grace listen if there's a Bible question then there should be a Bible answer I want to tell you tonight we have the answer Amen to the devil's question what is the answer to the devil's question question it is that he Christ is risen and has already paid the price and is raising up the body he said the devil's howling his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered amen by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body brother B says it like this he says in there there would come a time forth when he would Express himself in the fullness of his godhead amen deity through his church having the preeminence in the church he said what the anointed man amen but now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom amen anointed by what by accepting what Eve and Adam turned down listen the coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word listen Church what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept what Eve turn turn down will come back and there will be a second Eve who will be married to the second Adam and she will accept oh God she will accept what the first eve took can I say it when she turned it down she went out but when you accept it you go back in woo Glory what she turned down caused her to have to walk outch but what you accept is going to have to cause you to put on your walking shoes and start walking back into to the paradise of God where the power of God is unlimited by the restrictions of unbelief hallelujah what what Adam and Eve turned down is going to come back and we're going to accept I look at this word provided it means to make available for use it means to supply it means to equip or to supply someone even with something that is useful or necessary I love this it means to make adequate preparation for a possible event when you provide something you're making adequate preparation amen for a possible event can I say what a prophet said he said God's provided way is the best way he said for a chicken to get out of a shell he said God provided an instrument he said so that chicken just pecks his way out brother types that pecking his way out Amen to the amening of the word y'all know that amen he types amen the pecking of the chicken coming out of the shell Amen to the amening of the word of God that's why the devil wants to silence the amens in the house of God he don't mind if you clap he don't mind if you nod he don't mind if you give a thumbs up amen sorry but just don't say amen amen because the minute you begin to say Amen is the minute you begin to claim what you're hearing as the personal property of your life listen I'll say this I claim this message I'm going to say I claim this meeting I claim this prayer line I claim this atmosphere I claim these men of God I claim the anointing of God I claim it for the power and the manifestation and the demonstration of God I don't give it over to the devil I claim this not for miracles I claim this not for deliverances I claim this not for Transformations I claim this night for another Upper Room experience where the Holy Ghost fell and they got so drunk on God that they forgot what their name was they forgot where they come from they forgot their problems and they remember their creator and they remember they can do all things through him that strengthens them I pray we get so drunk on God we forget everything God's provided way is the best way brother B said that's a lesson to us that God will provide that's a lesson church God will provide there's no need of us getting all upset about anything God will provide it well brother Zachary ain't no need to get nervous ain't no need to get worked up we have a God who will provide it he said God always recommends to his people his believing children Amen to always go in his provided way now let me say this God amen provided a way for Israel amen which was the best you you agree the way that God provides amen is the best way he said now that way was Moses a prophet that was going to lead them amen to the promised land but he was not going to lead them by his abilities he was not going to lead them amen by what he thought but he was going to lead them by a god-given promise can I show you something here when God sends a prophet he does not build amen his church upon that prophet he builds his church upon the word of the Lord that comes to that Prophet which becomes the leadership because listen if God would have built Israel on Moses when Moses died they would have never went any further but because he was building it upon thus sayith the word there was a Joshua who could arise when Moses went off the scene well I might as well say it tonight Heen don't you ever build anything on a preacher because he could be here today and he could be gone tomorrow he could be here this minute he could be gone the next but you build your future build your hopes upon the message of the hour because God will never allow this inside word to fall to the ground he will never allow prophecy Amen to fail in utter failure but God will raise up an Aly rat he'll raise up a young person glory to God well I might as well preach I'm feeling good we've had some guys that got so big in Preachers and they thought they could say anything do anything preach anything and one day they woke up and I'll just say it they were stupid to think they had a Ministry without a prophet sorry Timothy it just come out he amen amen somebody say why somebody leave the message well that's Timothy I'll tell you this am meant they were crazy because they thought they could do something without this anointed word can I tell you something God has set down well-known preachers amen that turned against this message and he's raised up young people that's got the guts Amen to say what a prophet said he sat down important people who thought they were so great that the church couldn't go on without him and he's raised up nobody's on the Backwoods of nowhere cuz all he needs is somebody that'll just say what a prophet said and let it become the leadership of the lives hey I'm talking about leading by the word brother said they were going to the promised land they were coming out of a chaos they were coming out of a chaos and they were going into a Promised Land what were they doing they were going from the ridiculous to the sublime they were going by a promise brother J they were not going by their feelings they were not going by Moses's feelings they were going to the promised land amen by a promise that God would lead them there you know we find that in the scripture that there was a god of the old test and the Bible actually says that his name was Jehovah I love what the prophet says he says what he appeared as God Amen to the human race in the beginning he has to continue on Amen under those names and under that provision if he didn't then he certainly told something that was wrong when he appeared to the human race and said that's what he was and look what you'd make God then you would make him just a man you would make him a liar now brother Bram tells this very beautiful in the message of Grace 1960 or 61 he says I was out there praying and he said this Revelation came to me he said here's what it was I could not figure out amen the Jehovah and Jesus he said but then the voice spoke and said look the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new heard brother say today he said the same breath that said let there be is the same breath that said he that believeth on me amen has passed from death un life and shall not come into condemnation listen Saints Jehovah don't have one breath and Jesus another it's the same breath the same breath in Jehovah is the same breath in Jesus is the same breath in the seventh angel well I might as well go ahead and say it it's the same breath in every man of God who will say what a prophet said and when you begin to hear the Breath of God in all to ignite something on the inside of your heart to begin to believe God and to begin to back the word of I think it's time hey I think it's time right now to look that devil square in the face and say I'm coming out of it I'm coming out of it youve tried to bind me youve tried to hold me youve tried to restrict me but in the name of the Lord I believe that God is here and I'm coming out of it I'm coming out of it I'm coming out of it I'm coming out of it amen the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new he's the Jehovah of our prise he appeared in he has to remain that because he introduced himself to the human race by the names of Jehovah brother said it very beautiful he said now God his attitude toward the people somebody say God's attitude from or towards the people I love this brother Wendell amen from Eden Back to Eden is wrapped in those seven Redemptive names so God's attitude towards you young people people is in the names of Jehovah I want to tell that devil tonight we're on our way back to Eden because the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new listen and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever somebody ought to shout and thank God that his attitude never changes don't that make you feel good amen to know that the attitude of God it never changes what God thought of you in the beginning is what he'll think of you in the come on this ain't to love me today hate me tomorrow thank I'm good today think I'm bad tomorrow listen God's attitude is wrapped in his characteristic which is the fact that he can never change the way he thinks about one of his own children now when we start talking about Jehovah amen you all know one of the most famous uh one of the most famous Redemptive names of Jehovah is what Jehovah Gyra when you think of Jehovah you automatically think of Jehovah Gyra because the Bible said that God told Abraham he said Abraham I want you to go up on the on the mountain and I want you to sacrifice amen Isaac your son now I just want to say this there was something inside of Abraham's heart because when he looked there I love said today he said he didn't even tell his wife he was taking her son to kill him it's like brother Daryl Ward said one time he said Mama leaves you in charge of babies and he said we was at a fair one time time and he said Ally got lost and he said Of All Times mama calls us when baby's lost and says how's things going and you say wonderful he didn't tell he he didn't tell Sarah I'm going to kill Isaac but said but what he done was he walked out there and he said when he looked at them he said I and the lad will go Yonder and worship now I love what he said he said and I and the lad will return he didn't say we might come back he didn't say there's a chance we're going to come back he said the place we're leaving we're going to return to it and it's not just going to be me it's going to be Isaac with me also now come on church that tells me something you know what it tells me brother Samuel it tells me that Abraham knew somewhere between here and there I'm going to meet something that's going to allow me to come back here he had confidence in the ability of God that he was able to provide something that would allow him to bring Isaac back and he said I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and I and the lad will return now brother said Abraham got up there on the mountain and he laid Isaac upon the Altar and he said there he lays him out and he takes that knife and he said he raises his hand up and he's getting ready to come down and slay Isaac and he said a voice Thunders out and says stay thy hand Abraham he said stay thy hand said what happened he said God looked at him and he said see and thou has not withheld thy son amen my only son I know you love me because you obey me he said see God wasn't looking for Abraham's son he was looking for Abraham's obedience because all God wanted was obedience can I tell you that tonight young people all God is looking for is obedience he's just looking for somebody who is big enough to Humble themselves and obey his word see obedience is what God wants can I say this obedience produces more than we realize the pro of God said what is it he said this little faith woman this bride of Christ she is an obedient woman he said because she knows what he wants done with his word he said Abraham lifted up his eyes and he looked over there and behind him was a ram that was caught in the thickets ream said look here in Genesis 22:14 I believe Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen I want to I want to I want to show you something Abraham is up here on top of the mountain there's no water there's no vegetation there's nothing there Amen to produce the I mean there's nothing there Amen to produce the healing I mean there there's nothing there to produce a miracle I mean sorry there's nothing there to produce a ram but Abraham looks over there and he said there's a ram I love what the prophet said he said how could a miracle I mean how could a ram ever get there he said the text expl claims it I'm having fun he's Jehovah Gyra what he done was he spoke the ram into existence he said see it was not a vision amen it was a materialization it was not just an idea up there on the mountain it was a reality of the faith of Abraham's heart I'm just going to go ahead and say what he said he said if God has made a promise then God can provide the thing for the promise if God made the promise then God can provide the thing for the promise heard him say today he said God don't write a check until he's first made a deposit and he said if there's a check WR to you it's cuz there's some money somewhere to back it up wo glory to God and you got a Bible and it's full of 600 promises and the only reason it's been open to you is because there's a bank account in heaven and there's enough funds in there to back up every promise there's enough funds to save your family there's enough funds to save your children there's enough funds to heal your body there's enough funds to get you out of time back into eternity there is enough funds young people to pay your way amen from one dimension into another dimension can I say it to you write the check write the check the money's already in the bank now brother said it very beautiful he said he looked around there and God fulfilled his promise now he said God is able this morning to send his power in his midst of the Holy Ghost in here he saidy true Messenger from God believes that and you know what he does he holds on to it any true Messenger of God believes that Jehovah Gyra is still Jehovah and he holds on to that and he preaches it to the people he tells them that the God who is speaking to them is able to fulfill his promise he said now you say how can it happen he said now look here brother Brandon the doctor said I had cancer and he told me I was going to die he said I got 30 days yet to live he said I was going to die now how in the world are you with me are you with me how in the world is something I cannot see I cannot touch I cannot feel smell taste or anything else how in the world is something like that going to take this cancer out of me he said what is going to come down here and literally move that cancer what is going to come down here and literally move that cancer now are you ready for this get your notebooks out okay get your phones out and get your get your pencils out I'm going to give you a really deep theological answer okay here it comes what's going to come down and literally move this out of your body are you ready for it it's from Brother Bram and it's real deep okay you ready I don't know I'm reading you what he said he said I don't know but God promised it and God can provide something to do it I don't know how he's going to do it but I know he promised it and if he gave Abraham a ram if he gave Sarah a baby if he gave Hannah a child if he gave B barus his son that same God is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he is right here in the power of his resurrection he is here he is here to fulfill the promise of his word listen there may not even be enough faith in your heart to believe to raise your hands but there is a God in heaven who can come down into your heart and he can create a faith in you to believe what your five inner senses and your five outer senses will never declare he is just as much Jehovah Gyra right now I read that right sister lilan he's just as much Jehovah Gyra right now as he was then he still Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide himself away to make his word come to pass glory to God the Lord will provide himself a way to make his word come to pass now let me say this to you here's the here's the beau beautiful thing about it is this Ram comes into existence okay and I've I've often said it like this there was the ram you know what Abraham never did he never walked around amen and said there's the ram he never walked around and said hey Isaac look at the ram there's a ram do you see that Ram it's a good Ram do you see that Ram it's a powerful Ram Isaac do you see that Ram that Ram wasn't there 30 minutes ago but it's here right now look Isaac it's a strong Ram amen as long as he would have walked around amen looking at that Ram it would have never benefited amen the reason he was up on the mountain in order for that Ram or that fulfilled promise to benefit his life he had to walk over there he had to step into it he had to walk into it and he had to go over there and he had to pick it up well can I say this the Seven Seals are open Saints the Third is here the word has been revealed and it's never going to benefit you amen walking around and saying look what God done for brother brandom look what he done for brother Tim look what he done for brother sea look what he done for brother Wendell look what he done for brother bisc look what he done for brother Ron look what he done for brother Timothy look what he done for brother Ronnie it's never going to benefit you but if it's going to benefit you you've got to accept the Revelation that it's not just for that generation it's for this generation I'll say it as plain as I know to this is not an adult's message this is not a senior citizen message this is not a baby's message this is a believer's message if you're 5 years old or 500 years old if you can believe it you can receive the benefits of it I'm telling you this message is the ram in the bushes amen it's the Deliverance for your needs when brother B comes along in 19 1900s and he begins to say there's a way of God he said now the way of God Amen was to lead them by cloud of Fire by prophetic utterance by miracles signs and god-given wonders how many knows that God has provided the way you know what the way is it's the way of Salvation it's the way of healing it's the way of Deliverance it's the way of transformation it's the way of Victory I say this folks it's not a way it's the way and the way is a person and the person is Jesus Christ and he said I am the way I am the truth and I am the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me so in other words Christ is the way but here's the question how do you get into Christ he said now there is his body but by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body the body of Christ now listen which has already been judged well if anybody got a right to use that term you can't judge me God Can Judge Me is the bride anybody got a right to walk around and say you ain't can't judge you're exactly right we've already been judged because we are in the body of Christ he said see so we are free from judgment do you realize this message amen has transported you amen from Death unto life and I can say to you tonight by the power of the blood and by the grace of almighty God we shall never come into judgment or condemnation because of the grace of God that has been released in this generation now you say brother Andrew how in the world do I as a young person have access to God well brother R said it beautiful he said go back to what Paul said he said through the priesthood of Christ amen I'm going to pick up in Hebrews 10:19 having therefore Brethren weakness and cowardice and ashamed and and humility and humil ation and am I reading that right having boldness having boldness to enter into the Hol of holies by the blood of Jesus listen young people you ought to have some boldness about you you ought to get some grit about you you ought to quit being a dis rag for the devil and get some boldness about you some boldness to enter in by the grace of God listen how are we're going to enter in we're going to enter in by a new and the living way brother said that's not the Old Law he said which he have consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh I love this he said by a New and Living Way that was a that was the dead way and it was an order of law not the old way but now we enter by grace are you hearing me now somebody say with me now we enter by grace through the Holy Spirit nothing you can do the law was works it was touch not handle not taste not eat no meat keep sabbaths amen new moons all this thing but it was done for us by Grace we just accept it see Christ takes away the sin we believe it we hear the gospel we believe it accept it and then if we truly accept it from the depths of our heart God gives us the Holy Ghost as a witness he said then when the devil seen that he had made him go off break through anyhow then let them open other channels he said they'll either be f FCS or there'll be a bunch of starches but let me let me just go ahead and get it out there and say this we're not Fanatics and neither are we starches we are the Bride of Jesus Christ listen we're not here amen underneath a bunch of laws listen this is not legalism can I say it to you it's not rapturing works it's rapturing faith and it's rapturing Grace you say why rapturing Faith why rapturing Grace because church it's going to take Faith to accept this measure of Grace in your life it's going to take Faith to accept the fact that you are the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ it's going to take more than your feelings it's going to take more than your human stamina it's going to take more than your your your your family strength and how strong your daddy was it's going to take the faith of God Amen to release you from the condemnation and to accept the fact I am what the word says I am when you receive that you receive the promise and when you receive the promise you got to begin to plead the promise somebody say plead the promise if he's the Lord who heals us by Grace rest on it brother said everything was finished at Calvary he said here it is rest in the faith in the finished work and any gift that says any can I preach now any gift that says anything different from that don't you believe it cuz it's not of God cuz there is where the price was paid cause there is where the price was paid there is where everything was finished right there didn't our brother Timothy do such a beautiful job this morning preaching on the blood of Calvary the faith of the blood of calvary but I want to I want to show you something here it was not works always gets tight there brother Sean it's not works it's Grace you enter in by Grace now y'all want me to prove it to you prove it to you Jesus is hanging on the cross he's hanging between two thieves they're already nailed to the cross they're already hanging there they not coming down until their life has left their body and there's one on the right who looks over at him and brother it it blows my mind to hear a prophet say that that one on the right had never even thought about God his entire life his entire life he had never thought about God but when he was in that moment oh God when he was in that moment he looked over and Jesus looked over and he said f God he said father remember me when you come into your kingdom remember me listen young people he's breathing his last breaths I'm not is this okay brother wend he's breathing his final breaths and in his final breaths he finally acknowledges that this is more than just an IL illegitimate child from Nazareth this is more than just a crazy religious fanatic this is God and he says would you remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus said he said tomorrow when you go do something for me I'll see you in Paradise he said next year when you get good enough I'll find you in purgatory and I'll put you in Paradise he said when you get everything right you get all your hairs right you get all your clothes right you get everything right positioned no and say what the Bible said this day you will be with me in Paradise what works did he do Church what works did he do but while he was hanging on the cross in his final moments Grace Grace Grace was provided and he accepted the grace come on church and his next step hey Hallelujah his next step was into Paradise well glory to God hallelujah his next step was into Paradise his next step brother Sean he saw Abraham and Sarah his next step he saw Ezekiel his next step he saw shamgar I could shout right now or dance or bow apart are you hearing me and he began to look at him M Emanuel and he began to say oh you're the one that killed the Goliath aren't you and you're the one that slay the Thousand Philistines Samson oh you're Abraham oh you're Ezekiel oh oh I'm sorry what am I I doing here what am I doing here oh Lord there's Jonah oh Lord Oh Lord there's Shar oh there's there's Moses oh Lord not Elisha hey there's all these people what am I doing here can I say it to you Grace made a place woo Glory Grace made a place come on young people and the same God that was able to transform that thief in his final moments of Life ask come down in this building tonight in the preaching of the reality of the grace of Jesus Christ he's here to Pardon you can I say it to you Grace is Grace regardless of what form it shows up in Grace is Grace regardless of what form it shows up in and when you're desperate you're going to be thankful for Grace Oh Glory brother Miguel can I use you for a minute can I use your testimony amen a few a few weeks ago amen a fire broke out amen the fire was headed for his home going to destroy everything that he had there amen amen I'll say this but Grace showed up come on folks I might as well preach it last night Grace showed up hey you know what it didn't first show up in a fir TR it showed up in some Holy Ghost filled brothers that desired to get a fork and get a water bucket and f that fire but it was still Grace and then it showed up in a fire truck but it was still the grace what do you saying I'm saying it showed up here this week in a nearly 50-year man it showed up in a 28- year old boy it showed up in a bunch of preachers it showed up in some dorm leaders I rebuke that devil of legalism tonight I'm talking about the grace of God that has appeared in this generation for the Deliverance of the children of God Grace is Grace regardless of how it shows [Music] up Grace is Grace if it shows up behind the pull pit or if it shows up in hunting clothes with squirrel guts on its clothes and a Gro out beard well I might as well preach it was Grace when he was standing there in a suit behind the pull pit to Congressman up Shaw but brother sha it what no less Grace when he went down there to the infidels house in a pair of hunting clothes and stood there and preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ oh if I can just get you to see tonight that Grace has descended into this building tonight it's not here in the form of theology it's not here in the form of psychology it is here in the form of the blood of Jesus Christ what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah he said I'm a stranger to you but I'm your brother but now I'm his servant too can I say this to you Grace has showed up tonight Hebrews 4:12 says the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and it can go between the joints and the marrow it can go between the right right there it is it can discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart now we tell you A lot of times you got this and you got that you got this and you got this promise and you got that but do you know we've had Grace in this age and do you know a prophet can not only tell you the solution oh God he said that man sitting out there I love this he says sitting out there with a fistula now I did some research on that and a fistula is a tear in the human body which is normally hidden even from the eyes of a doctor but Grace but Grace he said but here it is you've got a fistula now watch this he said you got a fistula but do you believe Jesus Christ will make you well if you can accept it all right sir raise up your hand you got that white shirt on now I love this brother brother Jonathan he said kind of surprised you listen you it kind of surprised you to have that much Faith didn't it so he didn't just tell him what was hidden and what was wrong with him but he showed him that there was enough Faith Lane there to fix what was wrong what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying we're here and we're preaching the message to build your faith up to a level amen not to accept our gift but to accept the word when you accept something that means you've been designed to take a hold of it you have been designed for what you're taking a hold of to be applied to your life it means to believe I love this to accept something means to make a favorable response when you really accept the word a favorable response is amen come on Hatty Rod that ain't nothing but the truth what are you saying I'm saying what the Bible said that we have been predestinated we have been chosen of God to the adoption of children now are you all ready for this Ephesians 1:6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us somebody shout accepted in the Beloved you know what that word accepted means it means to be highly favored it means to examine with Grace oh oh God when you are accepted you have been highly favored you have been examined with Grace now how many's in college raise your hand you it's not a trick question you're in college okay how many plans to go to college or wants to go to college okay amen let me say this as a young person you pick the best college you can find okay whatever that would be best report best reputation most passing grades High Society everything you can find but you know what you got to do before you get in there you got to apply and you fill out that application and they go now now let me say this they go through that application and they're looking for you to have spilled your milk in the line at school when you was in fourth grade to put you out of there because they don't want you bringing yourself into their school and messing it up with your reputation I'm having fun so when they look at your application they're not examining it with Grace they're scrutinizing it and they're looking for one little teeny tiny one little simple little teeny tiny ioda of one little mistake they're looking for one one bad grader or one low percentage listen they may go through all four pages of your application and get to the last page and find one mistake and you know what they do they take that stamp and they say rejected but when it comes to the bride woo Glory when it comes to going to heaven when it comes to going in the Rapture God looked at your life and he didn't even get past the first breath and he saw a mistake and he saw Humanity but he began to examine your life with Grace he began to examine your family with Grace and you know what he did he said I see all those mistakes but I'm going to go ahead and do it I'm going to put a seed in their soul which means they are accepted in the Beloved well if anybody got a right to shout is the Bride of Jesus Christ can I tell you this you've not been accepted to Harvard you might have not got accepted to Yale you might not have got accepted to Arkansas University or Tennessee or anywhere else but there is a university hey there is a place there is a place in God where you've already been accepted can I say this and the more mistakes you got the better you make him look woo Glory the more more failures you got and the more troubles and baggage and and this problem and that problem and this issue the more you got is the better you make him look cuz my God Specializes in taking nothings and making somethings out of them my God Specializes in picking up Ash heaps and transforming them he inherits the desolate heritages he transforms the waste places and calls them his beloved what are you saying I'm saying we have passed from Death un life Grace has provided can I say this brother Andrew I accepted this message well praise God but can I tell you something it accepted you first W Glory Brother Joseph it accepted you first listen Grace I got to hurry Grace Grace provided a preparation brother said Grace is love he said God made a covenant by Grace I love this he said Jesus come to fulfill the law and Grace provided a savior again Grace provided a savior again he said for God had sworn he was going to save Abraham and his seed how could he do it with rebellious stiff hearted stiff necked people that wouldn't listen to nothing they had all their theologies and everything else he said how's he going to do it this is going to take this it's going to take Grace now can I say this they had not lost their Covenant they had lost their freedom when they were in Egypt they were still the Covenant people but they had lost their freedom they were slaves but the Covenant still lasted brother Caleb they were slaves but the Covenant was still over their lives he said God's grace provided a savior he said then when his love Jesus was projected his feeling Christ stepped out Amen to take his place oh God When Love Was projected brother Sean CH stepped out can I say this to accept you because God God through Christ provided a way to restore you back to the Garden of Eden when Christ stepped out he was accepting you in the father oh God hallelujah what are you saying I'm saying this it's time for you to step out I know that Devil's pushing right now cuz I know what he knows I'm getting ready to come to we're tur to a prayer line Saints we're getting ready to turn to a prayer line can I say this in this prayer line I want to I want to show you something as we turn to the prayer line I want to show you something about Israel in Hebrews 1129 the Bible said this by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians asan to do were a drowned look at this word passed it means to pass through it means to cross over now I want you to notice something they passed through the Red Sea they did not stay in the pray line I mean they did not stay in the Red Sea they passed through the Red Sea they crossed over the Red Sea look at this word aane it means to attempt a thing it means to make a trial of a thing or of a person look at this word drowned it means to drink down it means to swallow down it means to devour it means to swallow up it means to destroy so the Egyptians thought they would put God on trial at the Red Sea oh y'all ain't hearing me they thought they were going to put God on trial at the Red Sea by oh God by afflicting his people but you know what happened it backfired on them brother Matt they had this huge trial kind of like a bunch of a bunch of educated idiots trying to put this message on TR I'm sorry I ain't got good pull pit manners I didn't come from Ahab I come from Elijah they sit down and say Here's the trial on the message here's the jury and here Hey listen buddy you're 40 years too late you're 50 years too late this message is not on trial tonight but I tell you what is on trial is your faith in this message listen the message has already been Vindicated to be the truth but God is looking for somebody to step out and say it's the truth it's the truth it's the truth the prophet of God said this Covenant people who had the promise of God they were standing firm on the promise he said there it is some of my greatest trials or or victories has been when I come to something and I couldn't get over it and I couldn't get around it he said I walked right through it can I tell you something you can't get around this message and get in the Rapture you can't get over this message and get in the Rapture you can't get under this message and getting a Rapture you got to walk right through it and don't you ever forget this message is not your destination it's your transportation to your destination your destination is heaven your destination is the rapture and the prophet of God said look at the Red Sea he said it was a type of Separation it was a typ of the blood he said it was a type of receiving the Holy Spirit after the believer had been redeemed from death into life the power of God had healed his body now he's a candidat for the baptism of the Holy Spirit but he's got a journey ahead of him he said he's got to have something to pack him through he said so as they crawled out the bank he said after a while every believer when you come in they saved you still try to hang on to this and you try to hang on to that and you can't give this up and you can't give that up I'm going to a prayer line now you're trying to hold on to all these things but you got to let it go I said you got to let it go he said after a while God made you do things for you but you can't give up your cigarettes and you got to take a sociable drink with the fellas now and then but what you need to do is pass through the Red Sea what you need to do is pass through the Red Sea you say I need to pass through the Red Sea yes sir because Grace provided a way of Escape amen through the Red Sea to Deliverance by the pillar of fire veram said Israel was comfortably without a doubt in their hearts taking a nap in the the angel of the Lord and Pharaoh's Army was moving up against one another he said but then the wind begin to blow woo Glory he said then the wind begin to blow you know what he said he said when that East Wind begin to blow he said it caused the Paradox he said the wind be be begin to blow and then he begin to drrive the land off y'all talk about a God in the details he be to drive the land off enough for them to walk but not enough for the Chariot wheel rooll glory to God he prepared a prayer line enough for them to walk through but their enemies couldn't follow him out of it he prepared a place that they could pass through and the fs and the situations and the troubles canot carry well Glory Glory Glory what are you saying I'm saying we're fixing to have another Red Sea I said we're fixing to have another Red Sea sea hear me and hear me well the Red Sea walled up I need four preachers I need four preachers quick amen the Red Sea walled up amen come on I need four preachers amen I want two of you on each side the Red Sea walled up what God did at the Red Sea is the same thing he did at the River Jordan my Bible says in Joshua 3 that the priests bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and they stood firm these men of God are not playing with this message they're standing firm in the authority of the absolute in the hour they're living in those stood firm listen and on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan I love this all the young people all the Israelites they passed over on dry ground until all the people were cleaned and they went over the Jordan you know what the Bible says the Bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you know what that word lay means it means to attack or to put an assault upon something when you walk through this prayer line tonight these men of God are going to lay their hands on you the walls are walled up you're going to walk through this prayer line they're going to lay their hands on you they're going to rebuke the spirit of depression they're going to rebuke the sickness they're going to rebuke the condemnation they're going to rebuke the guilt they're going to rebuke the complexes they're going to rebuke the perversion they're going to rebuke the past and you're going to walk out of this prayer life unclean by the blood of Jesus Christ by the power of the atonement that has been given in this generation by the preaching of the Cross of Calvary hey Hallelujah I'm not a crazy man I've already had a Red Sea [Applause] experience I've already had a Red Sea experience I was a 12-y old boy when I had mine I'm just I'm just going to punch that devil square in the face brother Timothy if the devil could have stopped me he would have when I was a little 12-y old boy my first Youth Camp bugging the fire out of you and falling you everywhere but I went there wanting the Holy Ghost amen I'd never been in a prayer line before and I walked up there and brother Tim through it God bless his heart amen standing there in the prayer line I always thought when you went up there you told the preacher what you wanted little and I know God already told him what I needed he already told him what I needed and as a 12y old boy didn't hardly have no education had a mama that believed this message had a grandmother to raised me in church and my mama that didn't have a daddy that cared didn't have a hardly anything but I had a father and his name is Jehovah and the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new and there's one thing I can say God bless my mama tonight there's one thing I can say about her is she taught me this amen all the struggles we went through she taught me this one thing God is able to do anything he's able and I tell you this she said this this message is the truth regardless of what any man says and as a 12-year-old boy I walked up in the parine and I looked up to tell brother Tim what I wanted and before Mark I could open my mouth he laid his hand on me and said in the name of Jesus fill him with a holy ghost listen I went in one way but when I woke up I come out another way you say preacher you don't believe in the Red Sea you better believe I believe in the Red Sea because all the demons that was trying to destroy my life was trying to destroy my future they died in the middle of the Red Sea and I experienced the liberty of the power of God you say why are you saying that because the same God that done it for me is the same God can do it for you he's here tonight Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I charge thee by the power of the Living God take your hands off of this generation they're fixing the pass thank you Brothers no no no I need you sorry one more time they're fixing to pass through the Red Sea what are you saying preacher I'm saying this the Red Sea become an in for the Egyptian taskmasters what they thought was their trial become their end but for Israel it become a new beginning woo Glory brother when will it become a new beginning thank you for having these youth camps cuz there's some young people here tonight that the taskmasters were trying to destroy him trying to kill him and lay out of sea but you had a vision for the message to be preached and right here tonight them devils are fixing to die because this is an hour as you walk for this line you're walking into a new beginning I got to quit but stay there sh no you sh I hear that devil sh sh sh don't say this don't say this well I'm going to say it so pull you up a chair and watch me I'm going to say it I'm just going to go ahead and say it okay Israel left Egypt Miriam was with them I can't tell this without thinking about brother brother Roy Shrewsberry says is Gracie here vest raise your hand there Gracie we heard dad Le singing there at brother Roy and I remember one night we was having a shout and Hallelujah meeting up there and the power of God falling Matt and I was dancing around the holy ghost moving and brother Roy got up and he said I got something to say I hear him now Hallelujah Saints I got something to say he said we're going to praise God we're going to praise God Saints 97 year old man we going to praise God he said I just caught some inspiration he said y'all remember when Miriam left Egypt he said you know They Carried stuff on their heads he said do you know inside those baskets only thing they could only thing they could take was maybe what they could fit in those baskets he said so they packed all those things up he said and they started walking he said and they was on their way to the Red Sea he said and they started hearing some kind of jingle they started hearing some kind of noise and they turned around and they said what is that noise and they just kept on walking and they heard it again anybody got one they heard it again and they stopped and they said what is that noise and finally they turned around and Miriam said I'm sorry it's me I'm the Holy Roller but I got a covenant it's me they said Miriam what if you got in your basket she said I know we were leaving things behind she said but there was one thing I could not leave behind and that was my praise she said there was one thing I could not leave shut all them young people down from shout I can't shut him down I can't Clen it down listen it's all I got is some praise for God and when she crossed through the Red Sea she pulled her tambourine out and she be to shout and she begin to dance you know why because the prophet said she looked back and she saw her enemies were dead she saw her past was dead she saw her task Masters were dead and she be to shout and she be to dance and she begin to run it was a new beginning in the middle of a prayer line it was a new beginning in the middle of the darkest tower that they had ever seen I say this to you tonight by the word of the Lord in the name of the Lord It's Your not to praise God like youve never praised him before thank you Brothers what are you saying I'm saying this he provides for those who will take a step now I'm just going to say it and get it out there I'm gonna say it okay the Red Sea the Army was behind them the sea was in front of him the past was following him the future was ahead of them brother B said this he said I know the around you you have a phobia it's something about winter time when it comes you resent it you get scared when winter time comes it makes you all upset it makes you constipated and you can't eat right that's true I curse that devil in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ you go home and it won't bother you no more it has left you now let's just say praise the Lord do you believe it then don't be disturbed them demons will scream at everything but we're in the presence of Christ now woo we're in the presence no wonder evil spirits cry out they know their time has come Soldier Boy Soldier Boy Soldier Boy it's time to let it go it's time to Let It Go the pastor's on you but a prayer line is in front of you Hallelujah your pastor is trailing you listen I know what that devil does that devil talks you into doing things and then says I'm going to Blackmail you I'm going to that devil says I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to expose you and you know what I've come to the place brother sister I've come to this place I say this devil go ahead and do it devil go see that devil didn't like that but I'm not a I'm a preacher devil go ahead and do it because it don't matter if you do it or not because the one that matters already knows about it he already knows about it come on Church it wasn't the devil that led that boy up there to that prayer line that night with a homosexual devil hid in his heart and a prophet stand there and say you're not going to commit suicide what are you saying I'm saying this amen the devil says don't expose it the devil puts shame the devil puts guilt the devil puts condemnation the devil says if you only knew what i' done if you only knew who I hurt if you only knew what I saw the devil says all that and he Pils all that up on you and then he says sh you don't want anybody to know but I want to tell you this and I want to tell it to you in the name of the Lord he already knows it and he knew it before you told him he knew it before you decided to confess it and he already accepted you so what difference does it make I'm already accepted blackmail me if you want to devil I'm already in the presence of God I'm already in the message of the hour my name is already in the Lamb's Book of Life and there is a blood and it's a powerful blood it's an authoritative blood and it's right here in this building tonight won't you stand on your feet it's right here in this building tonight what are you saying preacher I'm saying this the Red Sea was a showdown between their past and their future will you go any further or will will you stop here will you come this far and will you lay down and quit or will you take another step and I tell you tonight young people this prayer line listen I preach many of them and probably preach many more of them but I'm going to say this right here tonight this is not just a prayer line This is not just another little prayer line where some kids are going to walk through it this is a Red Sea experience it's a Red Sea experience it's a place where diseases are going to die it's a place where doctor's reports are going to have to be changed by the authority of almighty God and Devil says don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go hold back it's just an emotion hold back it's just a feeling hold back it's just a bunch of work up hold back hold back hold back no don't on back greater is he don't do it don't do it don't turn loose don't turn loose greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world if you can just get out of the prison if you can just get out of the shell there's liberty there's Authority there's power there's joy there's a transformation but you got to take a step he stepped out and accepted you that's step out tonight and accept him step out tonight what he saying I'm saying what a prophet said he said you come right down here tonight and you say these words we're going to you just we're going to call prayer line in just one moment he said you come right down here tonight and he says as you walk toward this prayer line he said you raise your hands to God and you say I'm going to walk in there he said and when I walk out it's over
