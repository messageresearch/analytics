[22:27] But she's she's changed her mind. What
[22:30] was that? Okay. It's all right. Yeah.
[22:35] Now, my wife reminded me as she's
[22:38] getting ready to come that uh 41 years
[22:41] ago when I uh
[22:44] uh asked my pastor, I think I ought to
[22:48] ask sister Leah to uh marry me. And uh
[22:52] he said, "I think that'd be all right."
[22:55] And uh so after she said yes, pastor got
[22:59] up and in the pulpit and made the
[23:01] announcement that uh brother uh Merl
[23:05] asked Sister Leah to marry him and and
[23:08] she said yes
[23:10] and the church applauded. So that's a
[23:14] fact. Amen. They thought it was a good
[23:16] idea. Amen. Even though I'm probably
[23:19] sure some didn't. But uh sure appreciate
[23:22] Sister Tracy. Amen. All she means to us.
[23:26] And so
[23:29] she's got a just a beautiful gift of of
[23:32] of song. And so God bless you, Sister
[23:35] Tracy.
[23:45] When I think of how he came
[23:51] so far from glory,
[23:57] came and dwelt among the lowly
[24:04] such as I
[24:09] to suffer shame and such disgrace.
[24:16] on Mount Calary.
[24:19] Take my place.
[24:23] Then I ask myself a question.
[24:29] Who am I?
[24:33] Who am I
[24:37] that a king would bleed and die for?
[24:47] Who am I that he would pray? Not my will
[24:55] thine.
[24:56] [Music]
[25:00] The answer I may never know
[25:06] why he ever
[25:09] loved me so
[25:12] that to an old rugged cross he'd go for
[25:18] who am I
[25:22] [Music]
[25:24] when I'm reminded
[25:27] of his words.
[25:31] I'll leave thee never.
[25:36] Just be true. I'll give to you
[25:43] life forever.
[25:47] [Music]

[25:56] to deserve God's only son
[26:01] to fight my battles
[26:05] till they're
[26:07] [Music]
[26:17] a King would bleed and die for.
[26:25] Who am I that he would pray? Not my will
[26:33] for
[26:38] the answer. I may never know
[26:44] why he ever loved me so
[26:50] that through an old rugged cross he'd go
[26:55] for who am I
[27:01] to an old rugged cross he'd go for who
[27:08] Am I?

[39:00] You know, it's always reassuring in life
[39:02] when you're going through a storm or
[39:04] you're just going through life in
[39:06] general and there's a lot of things that
[39:09] are wavering nowadays. A lot of things
[39:11] you look out across the world and we see
[39:15] a lot of teetering. But we have this one
[39:17] thing for sure that the word of God is
[39:20] the rock. And if we stand upon that,
[39:24] it's lasted through the ages and it's
[39:26] going to take us home. Amen. Amen. Well,
[39:29] it's just wonderful to be in the house
[39:31] of the Lord here this morning and uh
[39:34] good to see everybody and looks like
[39:36] we're almost all accounted for. You
[39:37] know,
[39:39] uh brother Donald
[39:41] hadn't really heard the update on
[39:43] brother Donald, but I'm sure that he's
[39:45] okay and
[39:47] getting out today. Okay. Okay. Well,
[39:50] that's wonderful. We we sure love
[39:52] brother Donald. How many loves Brother
[39:53] Donald?
[39:57] And uh my uh y'all wouldn't mind. My
[40:01] mom, she's there in the hospital and and
[40:04] she kind of had a situation with her
[40:07] gallbladder. I think they're full of
[40:09] stones. And so she was in a lot of pain.
[40:12] And I appreciate the prayers and
[40:14] appreciate the sisters, you know, uh
[40:17] that took up the burden to get her there
[40:21] and um you know, make sure that she was
[40:23] safe. I mean, they were there. I believe
[40:24] it was sister April and and Sister F and
[40:28] Sister Carol. They were there till like
[40:29] midnight and uh but that's what we're
[40:32] here for and I just want to say thank
[40:34] you. You know, that's my mom and
[40:37] just appreciate that. So, but um
[40:42] but if we could, we'd like to go ahead
[40:43] and just move into our scriptures here
[40:45] this even this morning and and um you
[40:49] know, I'm a I'm an evening preacher, you
[40:51] know, so you're going to get this
[40:53] evening. So, that's just what it is, you
[40:55] know. I'm just going to say this
[40:56] evening. this is what's going to happen,
[40:59] you know, and and um but sure just
[41:03] enjoyed all the songs and the things
[41:05] that are
[41:07] that have been sung and s sister Tracy
[41:09] song there and just putting it out
[41:12] there, you know. I sure love her. Sure
[41:14] love her specials.
[41:16] But uh if we could, I'd like to go ahead
[41:19] and move into the scriptures here in
[41:20] Genesis the first chapter starting at
[41:23] the ninth verse.
[41:25] Uh
[41:31] when you're there, just say, "Man,
[41:34] you know,
[41:36] uh when you study when you study on a
[41:39] thought, you know, you got everything
[41:41] all written down and all put in place
[41:43] and everything and
[41:46] you think that you know exactly what
[41:47] you're going to say and and then uh you
[41:50] know, when brother Merl or Kobe gets up,
[41:54] you know, then you know things are for
[41:55] real. You know, you're fixing to go out
[41:57] there and things are going to get real,
[41:59] you know. So, but uh this is what we
[42:02] got. Lord laid it on our heart. So,
[42:04] we're just going to kind of
[42:06] preach what preach what's here. But here
[42:08] in the ninth verse, first chapter of
[42:10] Genesis reads like this. And God said,
[42:13] "Let there be waters under the heaven be
[42:16] gathered together into one place, and
[42:19] let the dry land appear." And it was so.
[42:22] And God called the dry land earth, and
[42:24] the gathering together of the waters
[42:26] called the heas. And he saw that it was
[42:29] good. And God let said, "Let the earth
[42:32] bring forth grass, their herb yielding
[42:34] seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[42:37] after his kind, whose seed is upon
[42:40] itself, upon the earth." And it was so.
[42:44] And the earth brought forth grass and
[42:46] herb yielding seed, and after his kind,
[42:49] and the tree yielding the fruit, whose
[42:52] seed was in itself after his kind. And
[42:56] God saw that it was good. And I have one
[42:58] more scripture that I'd like to go to.
[43:00] Just read one verse going to the second
[43:03] chapter of Genesis, just one page over,
[43:05] seventh verse.
[43:07] And I didn't give none of my scriptures
[43:09] to sister to Khalila or the crow's nest
[43:12] up top there. So, um, we're just going
[43:15] to see how fast she is, you know. But,
[43:18] seventh verse, it reads like this,
[43:20] second chapter.
[43:22] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[43:25] of the ground and breathed into his
[43:29] nostrils the breath of life, and man
[43:32] became a living soul. Amen. Let's just
[43:35] go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly
[43:37] Father, we just love you, Lord. We just
[43:39] want to thank you for the opportunity to
[43:41] be in your house, Lord. and just Lord
[43:44] sing songs to you and just be able to
[43:45] pray to you and just puress of spirit.
[43:48] Lord, we just thank you for your
[43:50] presence. And Lord, I would just ask God
[43:52] that you would just see our brothers and
[43:54] sisters, brother Donald, my mother,
[43:57] Lord, that are there in the hospital.
[43:59] Lord, I just pray that you would just be
[44:01] with them and continue to heal them,
[44:03] strengthen their body, Lord, be with our
[44:05] pastor, Lord, as he's up north. Lord, I
[44:08] would just pray that you would just be
[44:09] with him in his sermon, Lord. Lord, we
[44:12] just be careful to give you the glory
[44:13] and the honor this morning in Jesus
[44:15] name. Amen. You could be seated here
[44:18] this this morning. You know, um
[44:23] I was thinking about this little these
[44:26] passages of scripture and uh we went out
[44:29] west and um I got to visit to the other
[44:32] half of the world, you know, over there.
[44:34] I've been main mainly east and got to
[44:37] see uh you know the pines and different
[44:39] things and you know but here recently we
[44:41] went out and we just seen the desert and
[44:43] and uh got to see God's creation over in
[44:46] that area you know and we just got to
[44:48] see the huge towering rocks you know and
[44:51] and just got to see all the the
[44:53] wonderful creation and and um you know
[44:56] but when I was up in one of the places
[44:59] one of the uh little sight areas you
[45:02] know you kind of pull off off to the
[45:03] road and and you look out over into the
[45:06] canyons and just just miles deep, you
[45:09] know, and but everywhere you look, you
[45:11] begin to see uh rocks and how the rocks
[45:14] were just split open and how that there
[45:16] would be trees just growing right in the
[45:18] middle of them and and uh you know and
[45:20] and I was just looking at this rock and
[45:23] looking at how that you know massive
[45:25] this rock is and how you know strong it
[45:27] is and everything but wherever there was
[45:29] a seed was there was something there
[45:31] that was calling life to it and it
[45:33] didn't matter matter if the seed was in
[45:35] the desert and what the climate was, but
[45:39] um you know it was it was right there in
[45:41] the middle of it and you could see where
[45:42] the seed was just splitting or the trees
[45:44] were just splitting the rocks and and
[45:46] they were growing out and I just thought
[45:48] that was kind of fascinating. So that's
[45:50] kind of where I just draw my thought
[45:52] from here this morning. And but I was
[45:54] thinking about this and you know you can
[45:56] go back and you can look a lot of
[45:58] brother Brandham's sermons you know
[46:00] spoken word the original seed the seed
[46:02] shall possess uh the gates of its enemy
[46:05] you know he also speaks another uh
[46:08] sermon it's called the seed of
[46:09] discrepancy and so there's a lot of
[46:11] things that are placed there and u
[46:14] predominantly you know it parallels with
[46:17] life in general but uh but you know
[46:19] there's a so I begin to think about this
[46:21] and how that the seed seed planting of
[46:24] seeds and different things. It's all a
[46:25] process. It's not something that's just
[46:27] done overnight. It's not microwavable,
[46:30] you know, not just like popcorn kind of
[46:32] a thing, but there's a process that
[46:34] takes place. And uh you know, I'm sure
[46:36] the I call it the garden club, you know,
[46:38] the little garden club over there, you
[46:40] know, they got their little they got
[46:41] their uh they got their little beds and
[46:44] the different things that they put out
[46:46] there, you know, and but before you go
[46:48] out there every year, you know, uh you
[46:51] got to go out there and you got to get
[46:52] the weed eater out, you know, and you
[46:54] got to go out there and weed eat in
[46:56] between the in between the beds and you
[46:58] got to do um you know, certain things to
[47:01] prepare to be able to plant the garden,
[47:03] you know, And you know, there's a lot of
[47:05] seeds, you know, that uh, you know, that
[47:07] are ready to be uh, planted. You know,
[47:10] there's squash seed that gets planted
[47:12] out there. There's tomato seeds.
[47:14] There's, uh, whatever else kind of
[47:17] seeds, you know. I mean, there's a lot
[47:19] of seeds that get planted out there.
[47:20] But, you know, you just don't go out
[47:21] there and just you just don't uh, dig
[47:24] back the dirt a little bit and just
[47:25] throw a seed down there and you just
[47:27] have at it, you know. I mean, uh, but
[47:29] there's a lot of preparation that takes
[47:31] place. Uh, you know, you have to prepare
[47:33] the dirt and and you know, you make sure
[47:35] that there's water out there and so that
[47:38] you know, they got they got themselves a
[47:40] little hydrant that's out there, you
[47:41] know, so they can water the seeds that
[47:43] are put out there. And then you got to
[47:45] make sure that it's not covered. You got
[47:47] to make sure that the light can get to
[47:49] it, you know, and and uh but there's
[47:51] also a part of the process that is
[47:53] death, you know, that takes place. The
[47:55] seed has to die in order for it to bring
[47:57] forth life. And and I begin to think
[47:59] about how that, you know, in the
[48:01] scriptures, you know, there's a there's
[48:03] a lot of parallel that takes place. And
[48:05] God God even uh in the scriptures, he
[48:08] refers he refers to the kingdom of
[48:10] heaven as a grain of mustard seed. and
[48:13] and thinking about this, you know, I
[48:15] begin to think that how interesting that
[48:18] God uses these things to be able to try
[48:21] and bring, you know, our life and the
[48:24] scripture and he uses and we all know
[48:25] that God uses nature to be able to kind
[48:28] of expose himself to man and to be able
[48:31] to try and, you know, to be able to try
[48:33] to get you thinking about how things is.
[48:36] and you know and doing that you know it
[48:39] kind of jogs your memory and it kind of
[48:41] be able to put you in the mind frame of
[48:43] God and and I'll begin to think about
[48:45] how that there's you know there just uh
[48:49] there's a lot of things that you know
[48:50] like I said that when you go to when you
[48:52] go to plant you know your garden that
[48:54] there's a lot of things you got to get
[48:55] out in order to put in and how that you
[48:59] know I I look in the scriptures here and
[49:01] I begin to find and in one passage of
[49:04] scripture that kind of stands out to me
[49:06] is uh there in Matthew 13 and three the
[49:11] uh yeah Matthew 13 and3 you know the
[49:13] scripture talks about it's a parable and
[49:15] he talks about the he talks about the
[49:17] seeds that are in the in the ground and
[49:19] the planting of the seeds and if we
[49:21] could go ahead and go to that scripture
[49:22] there Matthew 13:3 and he spake many
[49:25] things unto them in parables saying
[49:28] behold a sewer went forth to sew and
[49:30] when he sowed some seeds fell by the
[49:32] wayside and the fouls came and he
[49:34] devoured them up. Some fell upon stony
[49:37] places where they had not much earth,
[49:40] and for with they sprung up, because
[49:41] they had no detness of earth. And when
[49:45] the sun was up, they were scorched. And
[49:48] because they had no root, they withered
[49:50] away. And some fell among thorns, and
[49:52] the thorns sprung up, and he choked
[49:54] them. But others fell on good ground and
[49:57] brought forth fruit, some 100fold, and
[49:59] some 60fold, and some 30fold. Now
[50:02] looking at this I feel like sometimes in
[50:04] our life we all file we all fall into
[50:06] one of these categories somewhere where
[50:08] where the seed of God is uh begins to be
[50:11] cast out and we know that it it's a
[50:13] minister or preacher your pastor you
[50:15] know or or sometimes it's the reading of
[50:17] the scriptures that's u being beginning
[50:20] to cast out the seed and and even in
[50:22] this building here this evening seeds
[50:24] being or this morning I told you you're
[50:26] going to get some evenings but uh but
[50:29] you know but even even this morning the
[50:31] seeds being cast out that here with in
[50:34] your minds and in your hearts and the
[50:36] scriptures that are being read or are
[50:38] seeds that are are to be planted there
[50:40] and they're they're to take root. And if
[50:42] we're not careful, sometimes we fall in
[50:44] a lot of these categories. Uh uh you
[50:46] know, but we all want to fall there in
[50:47] the eighth verse and in the good ground
[50:49] where the seed can fall on the good
[50:51] ground and bring forth fruit, you know,
[50:53] and but technically it's not always the
[50:55] case. If we're not careful, God will
[50:57] begin to to cast the seed of the word
[50:59] out over our lives. And it begins to
[51:01] fall on stony ground. It begins to fall
[51:03] on a place where where it doesn't take
[51:05] root and and we go through our trials.
[51:07] We go through the things of our life and
[51:09] and you know uh things of the earth
[51:12] begins to uh uh you know pluck it up and
[51:14] and the winds of life begin to take it
[51:16] away and and sometimes if we're not
[51:18] careful the seed begins to be put on the
[51:20] wayside and it begins to be uh get be
[51:24] able to be put out there and the
[51:25] different things of of the world, you
[51:27] know, begins to just take away the seed.
[51:29] But the the goal is is to be able to
[51:31] have a place that the seed could be
[51:33] planted in our heart to where God can
[51:36] manifest what he has desired in our
[51:38] life. And and thinking about these
[51:40] things, you know, there's there are some
[51:41] things that if we're not careful, we're
[51:43] going to have stones and we're going to
[51:44] have we're going to have seeds. Now,
[51:46] talking about this seed, it's not always
[51:48] good seed that's always planted in in
[51:50] the ground that there that there's all
[51:52] there's in order to go to the garden,
[51:54] you got to pull the undesired seeds out.
[51:56] You got to be able to go and you got to
[51:58] pull the weeds and you got to go pull
[51:59] all the whatever whatever the things
[52:01] that are in there, you know, and you
[52:03] begin to go out there and and I don't I
[52:05] haven't met a met somebody that went out
[52:08] to plant a garden or a flower garden
[52:10] that went out there and say, "Oh, wow.
[52:11] These are some beautiful weeds. You
[52:13] know, I'm going to water these weeds and
[52:15] we're going to let them grow and I'm
[52:16] just going to plant my little flower
[52:17] here." Because what'll happen is is the
[52:20] wrong seed will take the nutrients of
[52:22] the good seed and it'll begin to grow
[52:24] stronger or to begin to grow, you know,
[52:26] just as the flowers or the vegetables or
[52:28] the different things that you're
[52:29] planting, you know, but God's desire is
[52:32] is in order to have this good ground is
[52:34] for you to be able to pull out the the
[52:36] to be able to pull out the bad seed and
[52:38] be able to pull out the the um you know,
[52:42] all all of the weeds that are in our
[52:43] life. And sometimes if we're not
[52:45] careful, we can allow things to grow in
[52:47] the garden, you know, of our lives and
[52:49] and things of bitterness will begin to
[52:51] grow and things of insecurities will
[52:54] might might begin to grow or or you
[52:56] might have complexes that might develop
[52:58] or or you might have uh like I said,
[53:00] bitter feelings about about different
[53:02] individuals and and God can't use those
[53:04] kinds of things in order for his garden
[53:06] to be planted because if you're not
[53:08] careful, they'll choke out the seed
[53:10] that's there and and it'll affect your
[53:12] prayer time and it'll affect your time
[53:14] where you're sitting in the service and
[53:15] you're listening to a minister or it
[53:17] will affect the time that you know a a
[53:20] time that you're driving in the car and
[53:22] God's trying to focus and talk and speak
[53:24] with you but you're filled up with
[53:25] bitterness or you're filled up with
[53:27] ideas of things you know that's and so
[53:29] those are the seeds that we're talking
[53:30] about and and you know uh and not to not
[53:34] to draw off from the thought there but
[53:36] you know again I I had said that the the
[53:38] scripture uses the seed and he uses the
[53:41] planting of the garden as a parallel
[53:43] well for our lives. So if you go down
[53:45] from Matthew 13 or Matthew 13 and 8, we
[53:48] can go down actually to the 19th verse
[53:50] verse, he explains very clearly about
[53:53] what he's talking about. He's not just
[53:55] talking about just throwing some seed.
[53:56] He's not teaching us how to how to how
[53:58] to do a garden. God's not God's not an a
[54:01] garden instructor, but he uses these
[54:03] things so it can kind of catch our eye
[54:05] to what we're to what he's desiring us
[54:08] to see. So we see here in the 19th verse
[54:10] he says when anyone hear he's he's
[54:12] explain explaining the parable uh to his
[54:16] disciples here in the 19th verse he says
[54:19] when anyone hear the word of the kingdom
[54:22] and understand it not then cometh the
[54:24] wicked one and carrith away carry away
[54:27] that which was sworn or or sown in his
[54:30] heart. This is he which receiveth the
[54:33] seed by the wayside. But he that
[54:36] receiveth the seed in the stony places,
[54:38] the same is is he that heareth the word
[54:42] and anon, I don't know what that is,
[54:45] which which joy receiveth it. He hath no
[54:49] root in himself, but in or endureth for
[54:52] a while. For when tribulation or
[54:53] persecution arises because of the word
[54:57] by and by, he is offended. He also he
[55:00] also that receiveth seed from among the
[55:03] thorns is he that heareth the word and
[55:05] carth or care and care of the world and
[55:09] the deceitfulness of riches choke the
[55:11] word and becometh unfruitful. But but he
[55:14] that receiveth seed into his good ground
[55:17] is he that heareth the word and
[55:19] understand it which is which also
[55:21] beareth fruit and bringeth forth fruit
[55:23] some 100 and some 60 and some 30. So now
[55:26] now we're going from the actual physical
[55:28] portion of what he's talking about in in
[55:30] the parable here where he's talking
[55:32] about a natural seed, but when he gives
[55:34] his explanation, he's not giving you an
[55:37] explanation of of you know dirt and
[55:39] rocks and this, but he's applying it to
[55:41] your life and he's applying it to about
[55:44] the word. And now the word as if we
[55:46] don't know yet, but the word is a seed.
[55:48] and the seed can be planted in your
[55:50] heart and and and it's up to us to let
[55:53] that word grow in order for it to
[55:55] manifest uh the word in our lives. And I
[55:58] begin to look at this about how that
[56:01] about how that the word is something
[56:03] that in order for it to grow, we must be
[56:06] able to pull the things of our lives
[56:08] out. There's a lot of things that that
[56:09] we might that we might not might have
[56:11] rooted whether whether uh you know it's
[56:13] something that has happened to us when
[56:15] we were a kid or it was something that
[56:17] was that had happened to us or some
[56:19] something had you know somebody had did
[56:21] something to us and it's just something
[56:22] that seated within our within our
[56:24] hearts. But God's desire is for that
[56:27] seed of the word to be able to come open
[56:30] and become real in your life. So in
[56:32] other words, it would take some it's
[56:34] going to take some plowing. you know,
[56:35] and it's going to take somebody to get
[56:37] out into your garden. And it's not the
[56:39] literal garden that's out there. But
[56:40] just like as if you're going out to a
[56:43] literal garden, you got to be able to go
[56:45] to the garden of god's garden in prayer
[56:48] and to be able to come out and to be
[56:49] able to root these things out by the
[56:51] word and to be able to take, you know,
[56:54] you just got to get dirty. You just got
[56:55] to be able to come to a place, you know,
[56:57] and I'd always like the the example of
[56:59] the altar about where somebody could
[57:01] come and be able to come and just lay
[57:03] their life out before God and just be
[57:05] able to come and, you know, pull out the
[57:07] stones of bitterness and pull out the
[57:09] weeds of uh uh, you know, of unbelief
[57:12] and and, you know, pull out the, you
[57:14] know, all of the different uh all of the
[57:16] different uh seeds of of of, you know,
[57:18] discrepancy is what brother Brandham
[57:20] types it out. And you know, I begin to
[57:22] look at this and I begin to go and when
[57:24] we were as we were talking about how
[57:26] that there's multiple seeds that that
[57:28] are being planted in the ground. Uh you
[57:30] can you can go for or you can go there
[57:33] in Matthew 13, you know, that's the
[57:35] whole seed chapter, you know, the whole
[57:36] the whole anything to do with the seeds
[57:38] you can go and you can find there in
[57:40] Matthew. But it says there in Matthew
[57:41] 13:24, it says, "In another parable, put
[57:44] he forth unto them, saying, the kingdom
[57:46] of heaven is likened unto a man which
[57:49] seth good seed in his field. But when a
[57:52] man slept, his enemy came and it sowed
[57:54] tears among among the wheat. And when
[57:57] and went and he went his way. But when
[58:00] the blades was spring up, he brought
[58:01] forth fruit, and he appeared to the
[58:03] tears also." So the servants of the
[58:05] householder came and said unto him,
[58:07] "Sir, dust not thou sow good seed in thy
[58:10] field from which hast or from which then
[58:14] hath it tears?" He said unto them, "An
[58:16] enemy hath done this?" And the servant
[58:18] said unto him, "Wilt thou that we go and
[58:20] gather them up?" But he said, "Nay, lest
[58:22] while you gather up the tears, ye root
[58:25] up also the wheat with them. Let's both
[58:28] let both grow together unto the harvest.
[58:31] And in the time of the harvest, I will
[58:32] say to the reapers, gather ye together
[58:35] first the tears and bind them in the
[58:37] bundles to burn them. But gather the
[58:39] wheat into my barn. So now we have two
[58:41] seeds that are being planted up. One is
[58:43] one is the one of wheat and one the one
[58:45] is the one of tears. Now there one of
[58:47] these seeds is a desired seed. And I
[58:49] believe that every one of us here, we
[58:51] desired the the seed of God to be
[58:53] planted in our lives. We don't ever we
[58:55] don't ever want to we don't ever want to
[58:57] sew the seed of of of of disbelief in
[59:01] our hearts of towards the word of God.
[59:03] But but the thing was is that both seeds
[59:05] were going to go uh both seeds were
[59:08] going to grow up and and the and the and
[59:11] the goodman was just like was like no
[59:13] let's let both of them grow up and let's
[59:15] both of them figure out which one they
[59:17] are at harvest time. and and in saying
[59:20] this, you know, that we have to let we
[59:22] let the seed of God begin to come into
[59:24] our hearts and and if we're not careful,
[59:26] you know, both of them grow up, you
[59:28] know, now the thing about this uh the
[59:29] thing about this uh the planting here
[59:32] and and the farmer going out and do this
[59:34] is that both of them receive the same
[59:36] rain, both of them receive the the the
[59:39] same, you know, both of them receive the
[59:41] same winds, both of them receive the
[59:43] same sun, both of them receive the the
[59:45] same, you know, the same nutrients, the
[59:47] se the the the ground was plowed and the
[59:49] ground was, you know, was was all ready
[59:51] for the seeds. But the enemy come in and
[59:54] he swed the seeds or of the tears that
[59:57] in the field and and if we're not and
[59:59] sometimes in our lives we can plow the
[1:00:01] field and and we can and we can plant
[1:00:03] the seeds of God in our lives but the
[1:00:05] enemy would like to come and he would
[1:00:07] like to plant seeds of of doubt in our
[1:00:09] hearts and and and sometimes we there's
[1:00:12] a lot of us you know the farmer every
[1:00:13] time a farmer begins to go out he has a
[1:00:16] desired crop that he would want planted
[1:00:18] in his field whether it be wheat whether
[1:00:21] it be soybean whether Whether it be
[1:00:23] tomatoes, whether it be this, and
[1:00:24] sometimes there's desired, there's
[1:00:27] desired seeds of God's word that we want
[1:00:29] to plant in our life. We might be a
[1:00:32] young family, you know, and and and and
[1:00:34] we might be healthy in our bodies and we
[1:00:36] have children. And so therefore we we
[1:00:38] sewed seeds of of you know the word in
[1:00:41] uh in our in our little in our in our uh
[1:00:44] field uh you know for the Lord to be
[1:00:46] able to save our children and be able to
[1:00:48] save you know uh um you know make us
[1:00:51] stronger believers in God's word or you
[1:00:53] might be an elder and you might have be
[1:00:55] sewing seeds of healing in your body or
[1:00:58] you might be sewing u you know a
[1:01:00] stronger walk with God or you might be
[1:01:02] sewing these these things but there's
[1:01:04] always there's always an enemy that's
[1:01:06] out there as the scripture was saying,
[1:01:07] "There's always an enemy out there
[1:01:09] watching the farmer as he's beginning to
[1:01:11] sew seed." And that's how the devil
[1:01:13] works is he wants to be able to sew
[1:01:15] seeds of doubt and disbelief in your
[1:01:17] life. and to be able to to be able to
[1:01:20] try to deter you away from what what God
[1:01:23] is doing. And and and we if we're not
[1:01:25] careful, we begin to listen to the seed,
[1:01:27] the seed of discrepancy, or we begin to
[1:01:30] listen to the tears and and and and and
[1:01:32] we begin to look and say, "Well, you
[1:01:34] know, you the seed or the tears begin to
[1:01:36] talk to us and they and they begin to
[1:01:38] say, "Hey, you know, you know, I receive
[1:01:40] the same rain that you are and I receive
[1:01:42] the same son that you are. What's
[1:01:44] different from me?" You know, and if
[1:01:45] we're not careful, we begin to lean to
[1:01:47] the ideas of the devil and say that and
[1:01:50] he when he speaks to us and he tells us
[1:01:52] that, you know, the situation's too
[1:01:54] bleak for your children or the
[1:01:56] situation's too bleak in your body to
[1:01:58] where you're not going to be able to
[1:01:59] overcome or you're not going to be able
[1:02:01] to receive healing. But you know,
[1:02:03] there's something in the process of
[1:02:06] planting the seed. First of all, when
[1:02:07] you plant the seed, obviously you
[1:02:09] prepare the ground, but yet there's
[1:02:11] there's a watering of the seed that
[1:02:13] takes place and then there's also as we
[1:02:15] said that there's a death, but there's a
[1:02:17] germmitation that that takes place in
[1:02:20] the seed in order to bring the seed to
[1:02:22] life. And looking at this, you know, I I
[1:02:25] I looking at this here going going down
[1:02:28] to what brother Brandham has talks about
[1:02:30] here here in the message broken sisters.
[1:02:32] It says I it's just like I was speaking
[1:02:35] the the other night about the little
[1:02:36] eagle walking in the barnyard with the
[1:02:39] chickens and he had never known nothing
[1:02:41] else but the chickens but he had known
[1:02:43] that there was something that was
[1:02:44] different about the chickens and then
[1:02:47] his mother coming hunting him she
[1:02:49] screamed from above and it was an
[1:02:51] eagle's call. See she had had she had to
[1:02:54] be an eagle to begin with or he would
[1:02:56] have never recognized the call. See,
[1:02:59] there has had to be something there to
[1:03:01] germatize it or it could never produce
[1:03:03] life. If the seed, the word of God that
[1:03:06] is in you, the Holy Spirit is here now
[1:03:09] to germatize that uh to germatize that
[1:03:12] and bring it to life, it is a reality to
[1:03:15] you. So now, first of all, in order for
[1:03:17] you to be able to even receive the word
[1:03:19] of life, there has to be something there
[1:03:21] to call out and to respond to the seed
[1:03:24] that that was that is to be planted.
[1:03:26] There has to be a desire for overcoming
[1:03:28] power, you know, and if there was never
[1:03:30] a desire for overcoming power and you
[1:03:32] just wanted to live the same old life
[1:03:34] that you live, whether you're drinking
[1:03:36] or smoking or listening to, you know,
[1:03:38] whatever worldly music or running around
[1:03:40] and carousing or something like there,
[1:03:42] there's there's nothing ever there to be
[1:03:43] able to respond to the word of God or
[1:03:45] crave the word of God, you know, to be
[1:03:47] able to come in your life. But but in
[1:03:50] order for there's something to be
[1:03:51] germatized, there has to be something
[1:03:53] there at the beginning. And it kind of
[1:03:55] reminds me of the old pond lily, you
[1:03:57] know, scenario about how that, you know,
[1:03:59] that that there in the muck and the mire
[1:04:01] of the pond, you know, there's a seed
[1:04:03] that's down in the bottom of there, down
[1:04:05] at the bottom of that pond, you know,
[1:04:07] and and and no matter whether it's been
[1:04:10] covered up with mud, whether it's been
[1:04:12] covered up by rocks or whatever whatever
[1:04:14] it might be covered up with, once that
[1:04:16] light begins to shine over that seed,
[1:04:18] the seed begins to call out. And it
[1:04:20] doesn't matter where it's at in its
[1:04:22] life. It doesn't know, it doesn't matter
[1:04:24] uh, you know, how much that it's been
[1:04:26] covered over. It begins to respond to
[1:04:28] the light and it begins to grow out of
[1:04:30] the muck and begins to come up to the
[1:04:32] top of the pond. It don't know why. You
[1:04:35] know, it the seed doesn't know why. Why?
[1:04:37] Why that it's responding to to the
[1:04:40] sunlight in the way that is, but it
[1:04:41] knows that there's something that's
[1:04:43] calling it that there's something that's
[1:04:45] that's there in the sunlight that's
[1:04:47] there that's calling it out. And that's
[1:04:49] why, you know, every one of us are here
[1:04:50] in service here this morning. It's
[1:04:52] because, you know, there's a lot of
[1:04:53] things that we could be doing. So, a lot
[1:04:55] of us have work that we could be doing.
[1:04:57] A lot of us have things around the house
[1:04:58] that we could be doing. A lot of us have
[1:05:00] children that we could be getting
[1:05:01] prepared for the next the next day at
[1:05:03] school. But yet, there's something that
[1:05:05] brought you to the house of God because
[1:05:07] God is calling you to do so. But in
[1:05:10] order for the you know and and you could
[1:05:12] no matter what state or what situation
[1:05:14] you are in your life but there's
[1:05:16] something when the word of God is
[1:05:18] preached that it's saying that yes I can
[1:05:20] overcome certain things in my life. Yes,
[1:05:22] my children can be saved because the
[1:05:24] word because the word said so and the
[1:05:27] word and and I believe the word. yet.
[1:05:29] And there's something that's within us
[1:05:31] that begins to scream out that says
[1:05:34] regardless of what the tears say,
[1:05:36] regardless of what the people at work
[1:05:38] say, regardless of what whether I'm I'm
[1:05:40] I'm in the valley of the shadow of death
[1:05:42] or regardless of the enemy coming
[1:05:45] against me and and saying that I can't
[1:05:48] overcome, but yet there's something that
[1:05:49] screams out that says I can do that. And
[1:05:52] what it is is it's God's word. It's the
[1:05:55] light that comes over the seed that's
[1:05:57] within you that germatizes the seed in
[1:06:00] order for it to bring forth. Amen. The
[1:06:03] God's glory. Now, it's not your glory.
[1:06:05] It's not something that you're just the
[1:06:07] ground. And that's where we had read
[1:06:09] there in the scripture where he talked
[1:06:10] about, you know, and I love how God
[1:06:12] parallels a lot of this stuff and how
[1:06:14] God doveetails a lot. He says he formed
[1:06:17] man out of the dust of the ground. You
[1:06:19] guys are just a bunch of dirt, right?
[1:06:21] Right. You You're just a bunch of dirt.
[1:06:24] You know, you might have a nice suit on,
[1:06:25] you might have a nice tie, you might
[1:06:27] have a $100, you know, $100 worth $100
[1:06:30] worth of shoes that that's there on your
[1:06:31] feet, but you're just dirt and and you
[1:06:34] know, but God was using this dirt and
[1:06:36] God made this dirt and he breathed life
[1:06:38] into it. But but but but it wasn't the
[1:06:42] full focus was just to bring life, but
[1:06:44] God had attributes that was trying to be
[1:06:46] displayed of himself, amen, through you.
[1:06:49] And and begin to think about this is
[1:06:51] what is it? What is it that is in what
[1:06:54] is it that's in me that responds back to
[1:06:57] the word when it's preached? What is it
[1:06:59] that's in me? Amen. That when the word
[1:07:01] of God preached is being preached, the
[1:07:03] neighbor that's right next to you can't
[1:07:05] see it. You know, the neighbor that's
[1:07:07] right next to you, they're like they're
[1:07:08] like, I I I just can't believe that. I
[1:07:10] don't I I just don't get the whole thing
[1:07:12] about, you know, an end time message. I
[1:07:15] just don't get the whole thing about a
[1:07:16] prophet. You know, you know, good luck
[1:07:18] to you. But yet there's there's
[1:07:20] something in you when you when you go to
[1:07:21] bed that you you're looking up into the
[1:07:23] ceiling and you're like, "God, you know,
[1:07:25] what is this? What is it that's calling
[1:07:27] out to me?" You know, I hear the word
[1:07:28] that's being preached and and there's
[1:07:30] something inside of me that says, you
[1:07:32] know, I believe that. And what it is is
[1:07:34] is God before the foundation of the
[1:07:37] world planted a seed with you in mind in
[1:07:41] your heart that it would be able to
[1:07:43] respond. and and and saying this that
[1:07:46] when when God had done this, when God
[1:07:48] had done this, it wasn't just by just by
[1:07:50] luck. It wasn't just by, you know, you
[1:07:52] just go out there and you're just going
[1:07:53] to throw some seed out there and God was
[1:07:55] just like, "Wherever it lands, it
[1:07:56] lands." But yet, God knew exactly where
[1:07:59] you would be at at this moment. God knew
[1:08:02] exactly about about what you would be
[1:08:04] struggling with. God knew exactly how
[1:08:06] that you were going to respond to it.
[1:08:08] Therefore, he planted the seed in you
[1:08:10] and he knew that you wouldn't give up in
[1:08:12] the hard times. He knew that it didn't
[1:08:14] matter how how how deep and how dark the
[1:08:17] situation got, but that seed would begin
[1:08:20] to manifest itself at the appointed
[1:08:23] time. Now, I began to think about this,
[1:08:25] you know, talking going back to the old
[1:08:27] garden club over here, you know, and I
[1:08:29] began to think about this, you know, the
[1:08:30] the old garden club. You don't see the
[1:08:32] garden club out there during the winter,
[1:08:35] you know.
[1:08:37] You don't see the garden club out there
[1:08:38] when there's snow in the ground and
[1:08:40] they're going out there and they're
[1:08:41] pulling up pulling up weeds and they're
[1:08:43] pulling up the different things that's
[1:08:44] that's in the garden. They're like, "Oh,
[1:08:46] I'm going to plant this garden out
[1:08:47] there." But there had to be a season.
[1:08:50] There has to be a time that when you
[1:08:52] plant the seed that you know that it's
[1:08:54] the right sunlight, that you know that
[1:08:56] the rain is just right, that you know
[1:08:58] all these things are all in play so the
[1:09:00] seed can grow. Now there's a lot of time
[1:09:03] there's a lot of times that we can look
[1:09:04] and you can be like well Lord I mean if
[1:09:06] you look through the message of the hour
[1:09:08] you know you can begin to think that you
[1:09:10] know uh you know how is it that I'm to
[1:09:12] manifest the word for my time. Now when
[1:09:16] we first think about seeds, when we
[1:09:18] first think about it, the first person
[1:09:20] that pops into my head is is Abraham.
[1:09:24] Looking at these, looking at this here,
[1:09:26] the seed is not heir with the shuck. It
[1:09:28] says here the seed one seeds not seed.
[1:09:33] Well, actually, first of all, let me go
[1:09:35] to a scripture. We're going to go to a
[1:09:37] scripture here.
[1:09:40] They're in Genesis 22:14.
[1:09:43] And Abraham called the name of the place
[1:09:45] Jehovah Gyra, as it is said unto this
[1:09:49] day, the mount of the Lord, it shall be
[1:09:50] seen. And the angel of the Lord called
[1:09:52] unto Abraham out of the heaven the
[1:09:54] second time, and said, By myself have I
[1:09:57] sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou
[1:10:00] hast done this thing, and has not
[1:10:01] withhold thy son, thy only son, that in
[1:10:03] the blessing I will bless thee, and
[1:10:05] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[1:10:08] the stars in heaven, and as the sand
[1:10:10] which is upon the seashore, and thy seed
[1:10:13] shall possess the gate of his enemy. and
[1:10:15] in thy seed shall all the nations of the
[1:10:18] earth be blessed because thou has obeyed
[1:10:21] my b has obeyed my voice. And that's
[1:10:24] great for Abraham.
[1:10:26] Yeah, that's great for Abraham for God
[1:10:28] to come down and say, Abraham, I'm going
[1:10:30] to bless your seed and everybody that's
[1:10:32] in your seed is going to be blessed and
[1:10:33] they're going to be blessed uh you know,
[1:10:35] like for all the sands of the sea and
[1:10:37] all these. But those things are great
[1:10:38] for Abraham, but what's that do for me?
[1:10:41] I'm not of Abraham's lineage naturally.
[1:10:44] You know, I I you know, you can't trace
[1:10:46] my my my roots, I think anyways, go back
[1:10:49] down to Mexico.
[1:10:51] You know, I mean, my roots have nothing
[1:10:52] to do with overseas. The root my roots
[1:10:54] have nothing to do with all that. So,
[1:10:56] what's that have to do with me? What's
[1:10:57] Abraham's physical seed have to do with
[1:10:59] me? Which would be able to cancel a lot
[1:11:02] of us out.
[1:11:04] But it be and you know, but thank God
[1:11:05] for a message because I begin to look I
[1:11:08] begin to look into the quotes here. It
[1:11:10] says here the seed one
[1:11:13] not or or one seed not seeds but one
[1:11:16] seed going back to the message the seed
[1:11:18] shall not be at the air with the sh but
[1:11:20] one seed. These others were not seed of
[1:11:23] Abraham because Abraham's seed was the
[1:11:26] faith seed. Yes, it's that God that God
[1:11:29] was speaking of not of his natural seed
[1:11:32] because after Sarah died Abraham married
[1:11:34] another woman and had seven sons besides
[1:11:36] daughters. So it wouldn't be Abraham's
[1:11:39] seed. It was Abraham's or Abraham's
[1:11:41] seeds plural. It would be Abraham's seed
[1:11:44] one. And that was Abraham's faith seed
[1:11:47] pointing to the royal seed that was to
[1:11:49] come through Abraham's faith. Not
[1:11:51] Abraham's natural seed, but Abraham's
[1:11:54] spiritual seed who took everything
[1:11:56] contrary to the to God's word and called
[1:11:59] it as it though it was not and believed
[1:12:02] God against hope, believing in hope.
[1:12:06] That was the real seed that he was
[1:12:08] speaking of. So, we're not talking about
[1:12:10] a natural Abra. We're not talking about
[1:12:12] a natural seed of Abraham, but we're
[1:12:14] talking about the spiritual seed of
[1:12:15] Abraham. Now, I'm getting somewhere with
[1:12:17] this. Now, we're talking about a
[1:12:19] spiritual seed of Abraham. We're not
[1:12:21] talking about, oh, the the natural
[1:12:23] lineage of of of Abraham, but yet God
[1:12:26] used Abraham's dirt.
[1:12:28] God used Abraham's dirt in order to
[1:12:31] bring forth the spiritual seed. Again,
[1:12:34] we we know that God's talking in par or
[1:12:37] in parables. And now he's bringing the
[1:12:39] truth of the matter. And the truth of
[1:12:41] the matter is is that the faith seed
[1:12:43] that was in Abraham was the seed that
[1:12:46] God was talking about that I'm going to
[1:12:48] I'm going to multiply this seed. I'm
[1:12:50] going to multiply this seed that would
[1:12:52] that in your life. Amen. And it's going
[1:12:55] to bring forth my seed. Now, think about
[1:12:57] this. So, so as we begin to go, we begin
[1:12:59] to talk about this faith seed. Who is
[1:13:01] this faith seed? But there there in old
[1:13:04] time, Abraham's time,
[1:13:06] the way that uh yeah, but in in the old
[1:13:09] times in Abraham's now, we're trying to
[1:13:11] bring it down to us. We're trying to see
[1:13:13] where God's bringing it down to us. Now,
[1:13:15] we're talking about the faith seed, but
[1:13:17] but how is this what is this this faith
[1:13:20] seed that's within us that that how is
[1:13:22] this how is Abraham's seed faith seed
[1:13:25] all of a sudden? How is this bringing
[1:13:27] beginning to come down to us? And so now
[1:13:29] we begin to go into this message. Going
[1:13:32] go into the next quote here. It says,
[1:13:34] "But in old times, in Abraham's time,
[1:13:36] the way that they made a covenant was to
[1:13:39] kill a sacrifice and to stand in between
[1:13:41] the sacrifice. And then what they did
[1:13:44] was they wrote out a covenant on a
[1:13:46] lambkin and they tore it." And brother
[1:13:48] Brandham takes and tears a piece of
[1:13:49] paper to illustrate. One took one piece
[1:13:52] and the other took the other. Now when
[1:13:54] the covenant was confirmed, they brought
[1:13:57] the they brought it together. There was
[1:13:59] no there was no one that could
[1:14:02] impersonate that. See, it was to
[1:14:04] dovetail letter by letter just exactly
[1:14:06] the way that it was that it was shown
[1:14:08] down to the rightful owner of this piece
[1:14:11] uh that uh of of this piece has a part.
[1:14:14] This is the same covenant that we have
[1:14:17] to come together and dubtail just
[1:14:19] exactly the same. And God was showing
[1:14:22] there to Abraham that through his seed
[1:14:25] that God's Abra or that through his seed
[1:14:28] that God himself would become flesh and
[1:14:31] then have to be separated at Calvary.
[1:14:36] When Christ being when when Christ being
[1:14:39] God on the earth was separated, God tore
[1:14:42] him apart, the royal seed of Abraham and
[1:14:45] he took the life out of him and he
[1:14:48] raised up a body to sit on the throne in
[1:14:51] heaven and sent back his spirit o of of
[1:14:54] him upon the church that the that the
[1:14:57] church has to have the same spirit was
[1:15:00] in Christ to make it come together.
[1:15:02] making Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:15:05] and forever. Confirming of the covenant.
[1:15:07] God confirming the covenant. God
[1:15:09] separating and tearing the life from
[1:15:12] Christ, his son, taking the spirit out
[1:15:14] of him. He cut these animals in two,
[1:15:17] standing between the animals, the light,
[1:15:19] the light God himself went between them,
[1:15:22] showing that he separated the body, the
[1:15:24] seed, the royalty, and he took the
[1:15:26] spirit and sent it back upon the church.
[1:15:29] So there's where God begins to bring the
[1:15:31] two together. God took the natural body
[1:15:35] and he sent it to heaven, but he came in
[1:15:37] and he sent the spirit back down on the
[1:15:39] earth. And that's why it is so important
[1:15:42] to receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:44] Ghost. It's because what you're doing is
[1:15:47] you're making a covenant. God is making
[1:15:49] a covenant with you that he promises
[1:15:52] you, amen, that that that through this
[1:15:55] covenant that one day you take the
[1:15:57] spirit that's within you and it takes
[1:15:59] God the body, one day they mix and it's
[1:16:01] not impersonatable. It's not something
[1:16:04] that that Satan can come and he can be
[1:16:06] able and try the and try and do the same
[1:16:09] thing God did because the one thing he
[1:16:11] can imperson Satan can impersonate the
[1:16:13] gifts Satan can Satan can impersonate.
[1:16:16] Amen. uh I mean a good natural body on
[1:16:19] the outside. He could dress right. He
[1:16:21] might be able to sing. He might be able
[1:16:22] to preach. He might but the one problem
[1:16:25] that he has is he's not able to live the
[1:16:28] life because the only way that the life
[1:16:30] can be lived is by the spirit of God.
[1:16:33] And what happens is when the spirit of
[1:16:35] the Holy Spirit begins to come in your
[1:16:38] life, it responds to the seed. Okay? It
[1:16:42] there's something that's within you that
[1:16:43] responds to the seed. Now, now in order
[1:16:46] for this to happen, now there has to be
[1:16:48] a germmitation of the seed that's within
[1:16:50] you. Now, how do you get this seed? Now,
[1:16:53] you begin to think as well now everybody
[1:16:55] wants to go out and buy seed. Now I'm
[1:16:57] going go buy you know everybody thinks
[1:16:59] that you can just buy you know the seed
[1:17:01] of God like you do a tomato seed or you
[1:17:03] go out and buy a seed of God like you do
[1:17:05] a cucumber seed or no but that seed has
[1:17:08] been laid within you through
[1:17:10] predestination in your heart before the
[1:17:13] foundation of the world. God planted
[1:17:15] that seed in there. You had nothing to
[1:17:17] do with it. There was yeah you was in
[1:17:19] your muck. You were in your mind. You
[1:17:21] might have been in drugs. You might have
[1:17:23] been running with women. You might have
[1:17:24] been doing a lot of these other things,
[1:17:26] but yet there was a seed that was inside
[1:17:28] of you that was calling out to me. Every
[1:17:31] time you smoked a cigarette, every time
[1:17:33] you drunk a beer, every time that amen,
[1:17:35] you were running around and doing things
[1:17:36] that you weren't supposed to, there was
[1:17:38] something that little conscience that
[1:17:40] was inside of you that was tapping you
[1:17:41] on the shoulder that was telling you
[1:17:43] this isn't you. I mean, this mean you
[1:17:45] shouldn't be doing this. I mean, God
[1:17:47] expects something better than you. And
[1:17:49] therefore, therefore, you begin to go
[1:17:51] and you begin to try to do things. Now
[1:17:54] remember, amen, there's the seed of
[1:17:56] discrepancy that's there as well. And it
[1:17:58] grows up just like the other seeds. It
[1:18:00] grows up, it gets watered like it. It
[1:18:02] gets sunshine just like it. And
[1:18:04] therefore, there's where the
[1:18:05] denominations come into play. They get
[1:18:08] they look so close to the original seed.
[1:18:10] They look so close to what to what God's
[1:18:13] focus and what his goals are. Is that is
[1:18:16] that you begin to think, well, maybe
[1:18:17] this is it. But yet when the
[1:18:20] manifestation time comes, when the time
[1:18:22] comes for the farmer to begin to come
[1:18:24] out and he begins to come, look what the
[1:18:26] farmer said. He said, "No, let them grow
[1:18:28] up. Let them both be the same. Let them
[1:18:30] let them both receive rain. But when
[1:18:32] harvest times comes, you'll be able to
[1:18:34] pick out the wheat and the tears." And
[1:18:36] the thing is is is denomination has
[1:18:39] tried to has tried to mimic the seed in
[1:18:42] to be able to mimic the life by music.
[1:18:46] They try to mimic the life by being able
[1:18:47] to come up and and put together a a
[1:18:50] fancy sermon or being able to come up
[1:18:52] and be able to try to through be able to
[1:18:54] try to mimic the sea by prosperity. And
[1:18:57] you know, those things are good. We like
[1:18:58] good sermons and we like everybody to
[1:19:00] prosper and we all we like good music,
[1:19:03] but that that's not the focus of the
[1:19:05] gospel. The gospel is being able to
[1:19:08] change a life from the inside out. And
[1:19:11] it doesn't matter whether whether you
[1:19:13] have this world. It doesn't matter
[1:19:14] whether you have Cadillacs. It doesn't
[1:19:16] matter if you got money in the bank. It
[1:19:18] doesn't matter if you've got, you know,
[1:19:20] all your life put together or a fancy
[1:19:22] building or these different things
[1:19:23] because you know what? The savior didn't
[1:19:26] even have a house to sleep in. You the
[1:19:28] savior didn't even have a place to go.
[1:19:30] He was he went from place to place and
[1:19:33] and and he was fed, you know, but it was
[1:19:35] the life that was that was being shown
[1:19:37] to the disciples so the disciples could
[1:19:40] be able to to verify the the spirit of
[1:19:43] God inside of the believer and you you
[1:19:46] were chosen before the foundation of the
[1:19:48] world. You were chosen to serve God not
[1:19:50] by your own accord, but God planted the
[1:19:52] seed down in your heart. Amen. For you
[1:19:55] to when the word was be able to come in
[1:19:57] the right season. Now, if you were born
[1:19:59] in the wrong season or you try your your
[1:20:02] seed was trying to grow in the wrong
[1:20:03] season, it's just going to die. It's
[1:20:05] just not going to come. But you were
[1:20:07] chosen to live in this time. You were
[1:20:09] chosen to live in during a bride age.
[1:20:11] You were you were chosen to live at this
[1:20:14] time to be able that the word when in
[1:20:16] its maturity when it was be able to come
[1:20:19] and it was beginning to shine over your
[1:20:21] way. I like how brother Brandham
[1:20:22] describes it. the eagle scream that when
[1:20:25] the papa eagle was beginning to come out
[1:20:27] and it was being able to scream your
[1:20:28] name that there was something that was
[1:20:30] in you to respond. You were never you
[1:20:32] were never intended to be able to lay
[1:20:34] inside denomination. You were never
[1:20:36] intended to even just plainly sit inside
[1:20:39] of a message church and just live your
[1:20:41] life and be able to say, "Oh, I believe
[1:20:42] in a prophet." But it was a it was a it
[1:20:45] was the light of God's word. Amen. Not
[1:20:48] just anywhere. Not a message of
[1:20:50] justification. Not just a message of
[1:20:52] sanctification, but it was the message
[1:20:54] of the full restoration of the word that
[1:20:56] begin to call out the seed that say, you
[1:20:59] know what, I can take God's word and
[1:21:01] claim my healing. I can take God's word
[1:21:04] and be able to go and being able, amen,
[1:21:06] to speak the word over my loved ones
[1:21:08] that that they would be able to come
[1:21:10] into this life because there was a deep
[1:21:12] calling to the deep.
[1:21:17] I like this little story right here.
[1:21:21] And he said, now this is the dealing
[1:21:24] with predestination. We're talking about
[1:21:25] the seed now. Now we've gone from a
[1:21:27] natural seed that the garden cub club
[1:21:30] plants.
[1:21:32] Then we gone from the seed, you know,
[1:21:35] the faith seed of Abra or Abraham's
[1:21:37] natural seed because this is where a lot
[1:21:39] of this begins to kick out. And now
[1:21:41] we're beginning to go to the faith seed.
[1:21:45] But you can't just go purchase faith
[1:21:46] seed.
[1:21:48] You can't just walk out and say, "Oh, I
[1:21:49] got faith. I got faith." Because you'll
[1:21:51] begin to find where your faith is
[1:21:52] depending on the ground that you've
[1:21:54] prepared
[1:21:56] because some fall upon the stony ground.
[1:21:58] Some some of the seed. Now, it's all
[1:22:00] word of God. But it's up to you. But yet
[1:22:04] now begs the question is what is it that
[1:22:07] makes me call that makes me believe in
[1:22:09] this seed?
[1:22:11] It's not your pastor. Oh, we all love
[1:22:14] our pastor and he comes out here and he
[1:22:15] preaches the word of God. How many
[1:22:17] believe that? Amen. He preaches the word
[1:22:20] of God. We know. We can we can tell by
[1:22:21] the message. You can study it for
[1:22:23] yourself. You can read in the Bible that
[1:22:25] yourself that he preaches the word of
[1:22:26] God. But what is it that when he
[1:22:28] preaches this that comes and it calls
[1:22:30] out to you to be here whether the
[1:22:32] pastor's here or not? Okay. What is it
[1:22:34] that's inside of you that says that you
[1:22:36] know what to you know what if if all the
[1:22:38] world is stands alone. If all the world
[1:22:41] is it comes against this message there's
[1:22:43] there's something that's in me. There's
[1:22:44] something that's that's in me that calls
[1:22:46] out to the word of God that says, "God,
[1:22:48] I have no choice but to believe this. I
[1:22:51] have no choice but to believe this
[1:22:52] because it's something. It's who I am."
[1:22:56] Amen. You know, I'm just going to put a
[1:22:57] little thumb tack right there, a little
[1:22:58] sticky note there for the moment. You
[1:23:00] know, you can't help a thoroughbred.
[1:23:04] They like to run. And if you don't run
[1:23:06] in thoroughbred, they be they begin to
[1:23:09] get all messed up. They begin to get the
[1:23:10] jitters. They begin to have problems.
[1:23:12] They begin because they're a
[1:23:13] thoroughbred horse. And that's what
[1:23:14] they're made to do. You know, you can't
[1:23:16] help it. I mean, you can't help a fish
[1:23:19] that he likes to swim in water, you
[1:23:21] know? I mean, that's what that's what
[1:23:22] you could take a fish and you can and
[1:23:24] you can put him up in the tree all you
[1:23:25] want to, but he's going to die. You
[1:23:27] know, you could take a cow and you could
[1:23:29] you could you could make him want to fly
[1:23:31] as much as you want, but the second you
[1:23:33] push him off the cliff, he's going
[1:23:34] straight to the bottom because that's
[1:23:36] not what cows do. Amen. But but with
[1:23:39] with the son of God, there's something
[1:23:41] that's within him that when the word is
[1:23:43] preached and though it might be hard and
[1:23:45] though it might be though it might be
[1:23:46] cutting, though it might be something
[1:23:48] that you're just like, whoa, that hurts,
[1:23:51] you know, and it's just like, wow, what
[1:23:52] is it? But yet you show up the next day
[1:23:54] with your Bible and you're ready to go,
[1:23:56] is because there's something that's
[1:23:57] within you. It's like, God, don't let me
[1:24:00] get there.
[1:24:02] Don't let me get to heaven and stand in
[1:24:04] front of your in front of your white
[1:24:05] throne door. Don't let me get to the
[1:24:07] place to where where one day I begin to
[1:24:09] come and I realize, oh, amen. I threw
[1:24:12] your word to the wayside, but yet
[1:24:13] there's something that's calling out to
[1:24:15] you.
[1:24:17] And he said, well, you have said because
[1:24:21] you have five. Now, he's dealing with
[1:24:23] the woman at the well. Jesus is.
[1:24:27] And he says, well, you you said because
[1:24:29] you have five. And the one you're living
[1:24:32] with now is not your husband. He says
[1:24:35] quickly watch. There was the
[1:24:37] predestinated seed to eternal life. All
[1:24:41] the father have given me will come.
[1:24:45] Will.
[1:24:47] If that seed's within within within you,
[1:24:50] it will come. I don't care what you're
[1:24:53] going through here this morning. It will
[1:24:55] come. I don't care what battles you
[1:24:57] might be fighting fighting with. You
[1:24:59] might be you might be you might be
[1:25:01] covered over with certain things in your
[1:25:02] life that you can look at scripture and
[1:25:04] you can see where you don't line up, but
[1:25:06] there's a desire to be there.
[1:25:10] It will come.
[1:25:14] I lost my spot.
[1:25:17] It says quickly watch. There was a
[1:25:19] predestinated seed to eternal life. All
[1:25:21] the father has given me will come. No
[1:25:25] man can come unless he calls. Amen.
[1:25:30] Who calls? The word calls.
[1:25:32] The word calls you.
[1:25:35] It wasn't necessarily William Brandon,
[1:25:37] though. It was the vessel that God used.
[1:25:41] But it was God through that prophet,
[1:25:43] just like it was God through Moses, just
[1:25:45] like it was God through Jeremiah, just
[1:25:48] like it was God God through the the the
[1:25:50] patriarchs that was there. The preaching
[1:25:52] was of God was through Peter.
[1:25:56] All that I call will come. Don't let
[1:25:59] that tear sit there and tell you that
[1:26:00] you're not going to make a rapture.
[1:26:04] Don't let that tear sit there and tell
[1:26:05] you that your children are going to go
[1:26:07] off into the world and you'll never be
[1:26:08] able to come back. You know what? God
[1:26:10] will reach down to the pits. Some of us
[1:26:13] know cuz we've been there. Amen. There's
[1:26:15] those of us that have come that have
[1:26:17] come from the pit and God had to reach
[1:26:19] way down and God had to reach way down
[1:26:21] in life to be able to come and be able
[1:26:23] to grab us. Why? Okay. Now, now notice,
[1:26:26] hold on. Now, notice that when when
[1:26:29] Jesus went to the pool of Bethesda,
[1:26:32] okay? All the lame in the halt that were
[1:26:35] there, all of the Now, and if we don't
[1:26:37] know what the pool of Bethesda is, is a
[1:26:39] is once a year the angel would come and
[1:26:42] he would trouble the pool and he would
[1:26:45] trouble the waters that was there. And
[1:26:47] the first one that would get inside of
[1:26:48] the waters would be healed. Okay. Now,
[1:26:53] that was just that was just maybe an
[1:26:56] order or that was just something that
[1:26:58] was that was decreed through the through
[1:27:01] the prophets that was to be that was to
[1:27:03] be done every year so the people would
[1:27:05] have something to look to and be able to
[1:27:07] look. But that wasn't the purpose. Now
[1:27:09] notice when Jesus came was the trouble
[1:27:13] water was the waters troubled or was the
[1:27:16] angel that they were speaking of
[1:27:19] presently there at the time and notice
[1:27:22] he crossed all the different people that
[1:27:24] was there all the different lame all the
[1:27:27] different halts all the different ones
[1:27:29] that that were that were sick and they
[1:27:30] were in body and he come and he touched
[1:27:32] one seed he touched one seed that was
[1:27:35] there
[1:27:37] anyways throw that in Yeah. And he said,
[1:27:40] "And when the light flashed across that
[1:27:42] predestinated seed," now again, forgive
[1:27:45] me. I'm just going to go back a little
[1:27:47] bit. And the predestinated seed to
[1:27:49] eternal life, all the father had given
[1:27:51] me will come. No man can come unless he
[1:27:53] calls. See, all the father hath past
[1:27:57] tense.
[1:27:58] All that the father, all that the father
[1:28:01] hath called, see all that the father he
[1:28:04] unless he calls, see all that the father
[1:28:07] has past tense. So in other words, this
[1:28:09] has already happened.
[1:28:11] Has given me will come. And when the
[1:28:14] light flashed across the predestinated
[1:28:17] sea quickly, not like them educated
[1:28:20] scholars standing over there
[1:28:21] criticizing, they thought they were that
[1:28:24] group.
[1:28:26] They're educated. See, now remember,
[1:28:28] because they could trace their lineage,
[1:28:31] the scribes and the Pharisees and the
[1:28:33] and the educated men of that time could
[1:28:35] trace their lineage back to physical
[1:28:37] Abraham. Well, we be of Abraham's seed.
[1:28:42] No, but that wasn't that wasn't what God
[1:28:45] was talking about. See, they stood back
[1:28:47] and look, he says here, he says, "But
[1:28:50] they wasn't. They called him Beelzebub.
[1:28:54] They called him Beelub. The the the gene
[1:28:57] seed, the actual physical seed called
[1:29:00] the very one they were looking for
[1:29:02] Belzeub. He says
[1:29:05] Belub. But as soon as it hit the
[1:29:08] predestinated seed, the light flashed
[1:29:11] across it. She said, "Sir,
[1:29:14] now listen, listen. The seed was there
[1:29:19] just like the seed was in your life and
[1:29:22] somewhere you had heard the gospel
[1:29:25] whether it was from your mother or
[1:29:27] whether it was from your father or
[1:29:29] whether it it was by some preacher you
[1:29:31] happen to go somewhere she said she now
[1:29:33] listen it's not that she wasn't educated
[1:29:37] it's she said sir and look he says it
[1:29:41] come to life see quickened I perceive
[1:29:44] that thou are a prophet we know when the
[1:29:48] Messiah when he comes he'll do these
[1:29:51] types of work and all of a sudden the
[1:29:54] seed was quickened which is quickened
[1:29:55] means brought to life it was germmitized
[1:29:58] the seed was geratized in her heart and
[1:30:01] all of a sudden but think about it she
[1:30:03] was a prostitute
[1:30:05] think about it I mean she she she had
[1:30:07] done all ill-famed things and Jesus had
[1:30:10] even called her out and says and even
[1:30:11] the one the man that you're with right
[1:30:12] now is not even the one not even your
[1:30:14] husband and she's like whoa Oh, all of a
[1:30:17] sudden, what was it? It was that light
[1:30:19] beginning to shine over that seed. And
[1:30:21] it says here,
[1:30:23] "And when the light flashed across that
[1:30:25] predestinated seed quickly, oh no,
[1:30:28] sorry." And he said, "I'm he that speaks
[1:30:30] with you." Oh my. That settles it. See
[1:30:33] what all the father has given me. All
[1:30:36] the father has given me will come. He's
[1:30:38] talking about the preachers when he
[1:30:39] says, "As we only sow the seed, God
[1:30:42] lodges them wherever he will. some by
[1:30:45] the wayside and some come up from the
[1:30:47] thorns in a few days and the thistles
[1:30:49] and they choke them out. You see what
[1:30:51] God's done is he's he put the
[1:30:53] predestinated seed in your life in your
[1:30:57] heart and that's what you're able to
[1:30:59] respond with. That's why you know you
[1:31:01] know brother Mike you was out there in
[1:31:03] Kinwood Oklahoma but yet there it didn't
[1:31:05] matter how far off in the backwoods you
[1:31:07] were. It didn't matter how far off in
[1:31:08] life that you you thought that you were
[1:31:10] that but yet when God's light be to come
[1:31:12] out, God didn't have to come out and and
[1:31:14] drag you out with the rope. But there
[1:31:16] was something that was in you that was
[1:31:18] calling you to be able to come to the
[1:31:20] word of the hour and you are just the
[1:31:23] same spoken word seed that God is. If
[1:31:27] God tore himself in half and his body
[1:31:29] goes to heaven and his spirit comes down
[1:31:31] back on the believer, that gives you the
[1:31:34] power to say unto this mountain, "Be
[1:31:35] thou removed and cast into the sea."
[1:31:38] Amen. And those things have to happen
[1:31:40] because it's just as when God speaks.
[1:31:42] Amen. The a perfect a perfect example is
[1:31:45] Adam. How many believe Adam was the son
[1:31:48] of God? Amen. Amen. God scripture
[1:31:50] plainly says that that was there. the
[1:31:51] same power that was manifested in Adam
[1:31:54] wasn't just a one-time show and all of a
[1:31:57] sudden, oh, these are just great things.
[1:31:58] I'm just going to leave it at that. But
[1:32:00] yet, when I like the scripture where it
[1:32:02] says, "Unless a corn of a a a grain of a
[1:32:07] grain of corn fall into the ground and
[1:32:09] die," Amen. You know what what had to
[1:32:11] happen was God had to take his word, put
[1:32:14] it back down into the ground so that
[1:32:16] there would be other seeds, amen, that
[1:32:18] would that would produce of his life.
[1:32:20] And that's what God's doing here this
[1:32:22] evening. You didn't have no choice. You
[1:32:24] didn't have no have no thing. But there
[1:32:26] was something that was inside of you
[1:32:28] that was calling out. That was the word
[1:32:30] that was given for this day. Amen. Now,
[1:32:40] we can't hybrid this seed.
[1:32:43] You want the seed to work. You want
[1:32:46] God's word in your life to work. You
[1:32:48] can't hybrid it with doubt.
[1:32:52] You can't sit there and you can't sit
[1:32:54] there and and and expect God to do a
[1:32:57] miracle in your life and doubt God at
[1:32:59] the same time.
[1:33:01] Once the seed is germatized,
[1:33:04] you got to leave it alone. I love this
[1:33:05] right here where where brother Bram
[1:33:07] talks about the farmer. You see, you
[1:33:11] could take a man that looks like a
[1:33:12] Christian, acts like a Christian, but if
[1:33:15] that man hasn't got the word of God in
[1:33:16] him, if there's a germ of life in there
[1:33:19] to germmitize that, he'll never raise in
[1:33:22] the resurrection. That's right. Because
[1:33:24] he can't rise. There's nothing in him
[1:33:26] there to rise up again, a seed. Now,
[1:33:29] when you bury a seed, you farmers, you
[1:33:31] take and go out there and you plant your
[1:33:34] corn and and don't go out every morning
[1:33:36] and scratch it up and say, "Oh, let's
[1:33:38] see if it's growing." And anything
[1:33:41] happens. No. Then you put it back in and
[1:33:44] you late the next day, you say, "I want
[1:33:45] to see if there's how it's getting
[1:33:47] along." You scratch it up. It'll never
[1:33:49] grow like that. Well, the thing that you
[1:33:51] do with the seed, you commit it to the
[1:33:55] ground.
[1:33:57] Okay, you commit the word of God for
[1:34:00] your life into the ground.
[1:34:02] Whether it's overcoming,
[1:34:04] whether it's salvation for loved ones,
[1:34:07] whether it's baptism of Holy Ghost,
[1:34:09] whatever, whatever it is, whatever you
[1:34:11] could take from this and you can plant
[1:34:13] it into the ground,
[1:34:16] you commit it to the ground and you
[1:34:18] cover it up. That's all you can do about
[1:34:20] it. It's up to God to do the rest of it.
[1:34:23] It says, well, that's the same way it is
[1:34:26] with the word of God. If you take any
[1:34:28] divine promise God God made in his
[1:34:30] Bible, you put it in your heart and you
[1:34:33] water it every day with praise. Here we
[1:34:36] are with the process again. Amen. It's
[1:34:38] put it in the ground, your ground. And
[1:34:40] how do you water? How do you water it
[1:34:42] with your praise? And you and you put it
[1:34:44] in the ground and you water it with
[1:34:46] praise. The praise of God that is going
[1:34:48] to come to pass. It'll grow if you don't
[1:34:51] quit fooling with it.
[1:34:54] Quit fooling with it. Quit fooling with
[1:34:57] the word of God and doubting it just
[1:34:58] because of the situations that you're
[1:35:00] going through. Amen. That seed ain't
[1:35:02] worried about how hot it is out there.
[1:35:04] All it knows is it's got to respond. All
[1:35:07] it knows is I've been put in good
[1:35:09] ground. I've been watered and there's
[1:35:10] something within me that responds out to
[1:35:13] the out to the ground. So, if there's if
[1:35:15] you if you believe in the word of God,
[1:35:17] which I know you do because, you know, I
[1:35:19] don't believe there's seeds of
[1:35:20] discrepancy here. I don't believe. Amen.
[1:35:22] But I don't believe that, you know, as
[1:35:24] our pastor puts it, you know, God don't
[1:35:26] give him serpent seed to preach to.
[1:35:28] Amen. You can't be you can't be sitting
[1:35:30] there and you can't be wondering whether
[1:35:32] God's going to do something for your
[1:35:33] body. You give him praise even no matter
[1:35:35] if it's going to happen or or or where
[1:35:38] you are in your life.
[1:35:40] Yes, sir.
[1:35:42] That's the same way as with the word of
[1:35:44] God. You take you'll take any divine
[1:35:47] promise God made in his Bible and you
[1:35:50] put it in your heart and you water it
[1:35:51] every day with the praise of God that
[1:35:53] it's going to come to pass. It'll grow.
[1:35:55] If you don't quit fooling with it if
[1:35:58] you'll just leave it alone. Don't say,
[1:36:00] "Let me see if I can move my finger any
[1:36:02] better today."
[1:36:04] Don't sit there and look at your
[1:36:05] circumstances. Don't sit there and say,
[1:36:07] "Well, well, is is is my heart doing
[1:36:10] better today after this prayer?" Or or
[1:36:12] you know, is my leg healed or am I is my
[1:36:15] sight or you know, oh, you know, I I you
[1:36:17] know, I is am I delivered of this or am
[1:36:20] I this or this? Stop doubting it and
[1:36:21] give God praise for what he's done.
[1:36:25] [Applause]
[1:36:27] Don't say, "Let me see. Can I move my
[1:36:28] finger any better? Do I feel any better?
[1:36:31] Is my headache a little bit better?" Or
[1:36:33] they're all It'll never be that. Just
[1:36:36] commit it to God and walk away and leave
[1:36:39] it alone. Let God's seed grow. Amen. As
[1:36:42] the musicians come,
[1:36:49] just let God's seed grow.
[1:36:52] Let the seed that's within your life
[1:36:54] begin to call out. It's not your seed.
[1:36:56] You didn't plant it there. And you
[1:36:57] didn't do anything. You didn't do
[1:36:59] anything for let that to happen. It was
[1:37:00] God's chosen through predestination.
[1:37:03] Amen. for God's life to be brought
[1:37:05] through you.
[1:37:07] A lot of us are mucky. Well, was mucky,
[1:37:09] I should say. A lot of us were mucky. A
[1:37:12] lot of us had dirt in our lives, but it
[1:37:14] God put his seed in you. Amen. And he
[1:37:17] let the word, he let the water of God's
[1:37:19] word begin to go over your life so it
[1:37:20] could bring forth his fruits.
[1:37:23] I mean there's nothing more than a
[1:37:25] somebody's life where you see that where
[1:37:28] they had gone through heartache
[1:37:30] where they gone through trials where
[1:37:32] they gone through gone through things
[1:37:33] where they were lost in this or lost in
[1:37:35] that or they were you know they had
[1:37:37] addictions or they had different things
[1:37:39] and all of a sudden to see God's word
[1:37:41] shining through their life
[1:37:45] that's where God's desired to plant his
[1:37:47] seed
[1:37:49] you know His
[1:37:52] whole purpose was to be manifested
[1:37:54] through man to show the world that he
[1:37:56] lives again
[1:37:59] in the physical form through the body of
[1:38:02] the through the body on earth here
[1:38:06] through the many membered body. Yes.
[1:38:08] Amen. God's living again through your
[1:38:11] life. That's why he put that seed. It
[1:38:14] didn't matter if it's in between the
[1:38:15] rocks. It didn't matter if it was at the
[1:38:18] bottom of a pond. It didn't matter if it
[1:38:19] was up on the mountaintop. It didn't
[1:38:21] matter where it was. Once the word shone
[1:38:23] through your light or once the word of
[1:38:25] of God's light shined over your seed,
[1:38:31] it had to give forth.
[1:38:35] Don't doubt the seed of God that's in
[1:38:37] your heart here this evening, this
[1:38:38] morning. Don't sit here and doubt and
[1:38:41] say, "Well, brother Michael, I you know,
[1:38:42] I haven't had a touch from God in who
[1:38:44] knows how long.
[1:38:46] Brother Michael, I you know, I I
[1:38:48] struggle with this and and I can't look
[1:38:51] at myself sometimes as a Christian. I
[1:38:53] can't Don't you listen to those tears.
[1:38:57] Don't you listen to the seed of the
[1:38:58] devil coming and trying to coming and
[1:39:00] trying to interpret the word of God to
[1:39:02] you. You let the message of the hour do
[1:39:05] the interpreting. That's why God sent
[1:39:06] you a prophet.
[1:39:09] And there ain't no shame in that game.
[1:39:12] There ain't no shame in sitting here and
[1:39:14] saying that, "Oh, I believe in a
[1:39:15] prophet." You know, the world is
[1:39:17] wandering in gross darkness, but you've
[1:39:20] been given light.
[1:39:26] You've been given light.
[1:39:29] Right here in this little church is a
[1:39:31] lighthouse.
[1:39:33] So all this world can see who is the
[1:39:35] lighthouse. Jesus through your flesh.
[1:39:39] How is it? Sometimes you might have to
[1:39:41] you might have to you might have to go
[1:39:43] and you look and you have to get some
[1:39:44] rocks out or sometimes you got to go and
[1:39:46] you got to dig out some dirt and
[1:39:47] sometimes you got to go and and get rid
[1:39:49] of some things in your life. Not for
[1:39:51] your glory.
[1:39:54] Not so you could sit here and say that,
[1:39:55] oh, God's doing something through me.
[1:39:57] But you know what happens
[1:40:00] to wheat during harvest time? During the
[1:40:03] ripest part of harvest time, when the
[1:40:06] seed is at its maturest,
[1:40:09] when it comes up and the sun is at its
[1:40:11] hot is is at its hottest.
[1:40:16] When the seed is is mature and the sun's
[1:40:18] hot,
[1:40:20] it bows.
[1:40:23] It lays over. And that's how you know
[1:40:25] it's ready for harvest.
[1:40:29] and how you know you're mature
[1:40:32] and how you know that that Lord, you're
[1:40:35] you're perfecting a work in me. And so
[1:40:37] all of a sudden that humility begins to
[1:40:39] come out. Oh, it's hard sometimes. Oh,
[1:40:43] it's hard because some of us got that
[1:40:44] flesh man that's there. And you're
[1:40:46] always going to deal with this sticky
[1:40:47] nature. You're always going to deal with
[1:40:50] this flesh. But you keep pushing
[1:40:54] and you keep pushing
[1:40:56] and you push through everything that the
[1:40:59] devil says when he says that you're not
[1:41:00] an overcomer. But you can't help but be
[1:41:03] an overcomer. You can't help but sit
[1:41:06] there and say, "God, I'm struggling with
[1:41:08] these things in my life, but Lord, by
[1:41:11] your strength,
[1:41:13] in my weakness, your strength is made
[1:41:16] perfect.
[1:41:17] In my weakness, Lord, I'm struggling
[1:41:20] with these. I'm struggling with the idea
[1:41:22] that you could call me to be a son of
[1:41:24] God. When when I look at this flesh and
[1:41:26] Lord, I try and I and I and I do
[1:41:28] everything that I can. I read your word,
[1:41:30] listen to your message. Amen. And
[1:41:32] there's something that's calling out
[1:41:34] within my heart.
[1:41:37] You just listen for the whisper of the
[1:41:39] master and be like, "That seed was never
[1:41:42] part of you. I planted that seed within
[1:41:44] you. I knew that you could overcome
[1:41:47] before I even created the ground for you
[1:41:50] to walk on. You were in my forthoughts.
[1:41:53] You were in my mind. You were in my
[1:41:55] knowledge.
[1:41:57] I loved you before the devil even hated
[1:42:00] you.
[1:42:03] I knew
[1:42:05] I knew that if I put you in this ground,
[1:42:08] in this rocky ground, in this in this in
[1:42:11] this in this barren ground, I knew that
[1:42:13] no matter what you was going to do, what
[1:42:15] you take, you would put yourself into a
[1:42:17] place that you could grow.
[1:42:20] Now, look at you.
[1:42:22] Stop looking at all the all the things
[1:42:25] that you're struggling with and look
[1:42:27] where look stop looking at where you
[1:42:29] stop looking at where you're at. Look
[1:42:30] where God's brought you from.
[1:42:34] God's brought you from broken homes.
[1:42:38] God's brought you out of out of out of
[1:42:39] sicknesses. God's brought you I mean,
[1:42:42] many of us have struggled with different
[1:42:43] things in our life. There's testimonies
[1:42:45] of every one of us that standing that
[1:42:47] are standing here or that are sitting
[1:42:49] here this morning.
[1:42:51] But it wasn't you.
[1:42:54] It wasn't you. It was Almighty
[1:42:57] God.
[1:42:59] the one that causes the sun to come up
[1:43:01] in the morning to set in the evening. It
[1:43:04] was the very one that causes the grass
[1:43:06] to grow and the seasons to come. He's
[1:43:09] the one that planted the seed within
[1:43:11] you. And you might be going through
[1:43:13] things in your life, but God's going to
[1:43:15] make sure that you're fed by the word.
[1:43:16] And it's up to you to be able to prepare
[1:43:18] that ground for him to come and for God
[1:43:21] to be able to put it out. You are an
[1:43:23] overcomer.
[1:43:26] Amen. What are we singing, Kobe?
