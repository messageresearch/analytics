Spirit [Music] I [Music] oh come in thy own spal way amen isn't that our desire for him to come how he wants to amen not what we think or how we envision him to come but we want him to come the way he wants to amen did you enjoy that this morning I sure did you know I it's funny because it doesn't matter how old you get you think you're young you feel young in your spirit and I just I like young people and especially those that are on fire for God and the Zeal that they have you know we was listening a few days ago to a young preacher and he was was telling us he was 21 years old and he was going on and the way he was going on I you're thinking okay now I've been 21 almost three times now and he's going on you're like okay you're 21 uh okay but that Zeal you know that's what God likes is a Zeal for his word in his people doesn't matter how old you get or or whatever we should have that Zeal for God and his word and for God and his people all the time we shouldn't lose that that's right because that's what God that's what he's expecting from us amen let's turn in our Bibles don't want to keep you that long and let's turn into Matthew Chapter 13 and we'll read this scripture and prise the Lord I was telling them here a while back and uh you know all the preachers get up and they're like do you love the Lord everybody's like and I'm like in my mind this is just me now but in my mind it's like uh yeah that's why we're here because we love the Lord and then the brother was telling me after church he was like yeah you know I kind of use that as a filler I'm like okay that's fine but that's why we're here because we love the Lord right I mean maybe unless you're 10 12 years old and was drug here but we're here because we love God and we want we want to hear from God and and God has a way that he speaks to his people right come on all right amen amen and that's what we want is you know brother Bram told us we come here CU we want to hear from God God what are you expecting from us how do you you know show me Lord what you are expecting amen okay Matthew Chapter 13 and I want to read one verse and it's verse 35 and it says that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world father as we come before you we sung the songs of worship Lord and father we just love you and we want to worship you however we can father and we've sung those songs now and we've done our part and we're expecting now father that you would do your part that you would come and break the Word of Life To Us Lord father help us give us an ear to hear you said blessed are those that have an ear to hear what the spirit is saying and help us Lord as a speaker to only say your word father take these lips of clay and not let nothing come out but what is your word father for we believe that it's ministering angels that come down if the man can get himself out of the way and that angel can come and speak to the people we just love you father we appreciate all that you've done for us and all that you do for us we just Commit This service into your hands in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated I kind of's see have two thoughts here that I want to maybe blend together in a uh you know it's a good thing that the Bible says the foolishness of preaching because as a preacher you get going and God starts laying something out for you and you're like wow that's really good and you're putting down your notes and you're going this way and that way and you get up to speak and you're like what in the world did I just say because as you're listening you're like man this is not what how God put it together what am I doing wrong but God knows how to direct the thoughts or what the speaker is saying to each individual and if you've ever get in someplace and you get outgoing and you'll get testimonies back from people and they're like man God spoke to me and he's this and you're like I never said that that was not what I was saying that was not my thought or my intent but but see it's not like we're saying it's not what we think or how it should be it's the way that God does it because that's why we're here because we want God to speak to each heart individually and he knows how to do it he knows how to to get that one thing that will catch and will help you right because that should be our desire here is something that God can help the people with not to lift ourselves up not to we're not here to make ourselves great we're here that God can work through us to get his plan out to the people amen because we know God has a certain way that he will talk to his people right and that's what I from the very beginning when I came into this message and I always wanted to know when you know they said well God sent a prophet great but what did the prophet say because I was listening to the prophet when the prophet Prophet said that God will send a prophet because he wants to speak to the people God doesn't send a prophet just to say look I sent a prophet right why because the people turned that down where he would talk to them individually lift the ear so what they when they rejected that then he said okay I'll rise up a prophet and when I want to speak to you the prophet will come and speak to you amen okay good so I want to kind of take a topic of the new book living in the glare okay so I know okay now they're like okay now how's this that's a weird title but let me read this to you brother brandom in the message the presence of God unrecognized it comes in and it goes out people does not recognize it until it's past and they because that it never fit their theology it never fits the time of the day see what it is they're always living in the glare of another age always right and we know how brother brandom said they're not only looking backwards or they're looking out here to the Future they miss what God is trying to do right now so brother Bram says they're always living in the glare of another age and for myself I kind of bring everything back to what we call the message because God's not dealing with them anymore he's dealing with the message what we call the message but you know Paul called it the gospel you see so sometimes we start LIF lifting up something and we make that a something and not realizing that what we're preaching is the gospel the good news Okay so living in the glare so what happened was people even today in what we would call the message are living at something that God's done back here and not bringing it Forward right what did Brother brandom say what the people will do was they'll stop at the signpost and they'll point to the signpost not uh not pointing to what the signpost is saying right why do you have a signpost the signpost is trying to tell you you're going somewhere right and we're going in the rapture we are going to have a change of this body what they never thought of like brother Brown said he he even thought that it was like oh we're going to live on the cloud somewhere and play the harp and you know oh there goes brother window Hey Brother W how you doing right because that's what they thought but we know that's not true we know we're going to a place where we have bodies where we are going to shake one another's hands we're going to hug one another we're going to be able to sit down in Fellowship right so I think what happened was people don't um don't realize that what we had was a dual purpose profit so you're like what a d a purpose Prophet yes I do a purpose Prophet so what did Brother brandom say that a messenger was was uh how would you say what a messenger was sent to do a messenger is sent to one draw all the Believers out of one age bring them out close that age and then he opens another age you see sometimes we need to look and and uh like brother Brown said read between the line because we think well we're in the leodan age but you know there's two ages in the leodan age there was the Pentecostal age and then there is a bride age right that's what he said so I think what is happened is when brother brandom came and the angel came what did he do he came and brother Bram said this he said he came as one out of season he came to the Pentecostal church but that's not what he was sent for but being the messenger he had to what he had to pull the Believers out of that age seal that age the plague struck all right right and what did Brother Ram say the plague of the Pentecostal church was whism come on so that worldism is what caught those guys right brother brand said and we got to watch it because influences keep going on so brother random said that what their uh what they what they did was because they want to keep the children they brought rock and roll music into the church worldliness into the church to keep the children and we find not that per se but we find things going on in the message sorry but what they are doing and what I see going out there is they are starting to bring games and things to keep the children I mean there's churches out there that are building uh what do we call them in our day arcades to draw the children but but you know what the children need the same thing that we needed that's right the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what will keep a person the baptism of the Holy Ghost will will keep that person serving God and wanting to be here that's what brings us together as the spirit of God we need that Spirit of our young people need that spirit of God spirit in their lives and that's what will draw them the same as draw you amen so what happened to me this is me now so when God called The Believers and that's what they were they were the Believers he called the bride out of that Pentecostal age he closed that age and now he was going to what open a bride age for for the people but what happened these that came out of this age the bride the the the uh elect of that age what did they come out under what was the influence of that age denominationalism so now these ones that come out of this age what happened they became the first pastors of the Bride age but they came out with an influence of denominationalism and they brought it's in the church age book actually if you want to go and read it and they brought that out it's not that they became that denomination but brother Bram said that influence is there the influence of denominationalism came into the start of the message so now the churches rise up and what happens they rise up under denominationalism you ever is this thing here we go so okay good it'll go back up easy so now listen I get this because a while back I was studying something and I was studying about the cloud and when it first when the F Cloud was first uh how would you say looked at all the time it wasn't until and I might not you know I mean you sometimes you you know what brother random said but but then you go back to try and find it you know how he said it to you but now you've got to uh um figure remember how he said it so that you could look it up okay good so it wasn't until what I could find was July of 1965 is when brother brandom said and started talking about how the angel came to him and said turn it right he said what turn what do you mean turn it right am I not looking turn it to the right but up until that time and it's still going on today what were people doing what was it always about the cloud oh look at the Angels here look at the wings here look it over here and you can see the wing of this one and that one and brother brandom's talking about he goes when I was there and the Seven Angels were there what was he always doing he was pointing to man right showing lifting up look at those angels oh they're great and they're this well we have that still today in the message we were talking about it in the back men wanting to build their own Kingdoms in the message trying to build themselves up to build their own ideals up and not what it was is all about and so now I'm starting to think and just cuz I get to go out and I go out all over and you see all kinds of things and we know just as the scripture says not all Israel is Israel not all that claimed to be the message is the message but brother brandom says what happens though is people out there all they see is the collectiveness of what we call the message so they look at that and they see what is going on there and and that's what forms their opinion so brother brandom finally turns and that's okay so brother Brandon finally said or the angel told brother brandom said turn it right turn it right what do you mean turn it right so finally what did he do he turned it right and what did he see Christ now the focus isn't on angels and on all that kind of stuff but the focus needs to be on Christ that's what our focus is supposed to be on Christ not upon all this angel or that great preacher or this church or that it needs to be upon Christ right after the the seals were open what did Brother Brandon preach Christ The Mystery of God revealed not the Angels not the churches Christ The Mystery of God revealed and so we need to because the Bible tells us if we lift him up he'll draw all men unto him now use that as uh because we know not all men are going to come but I was like to say well if we really lifting Christ up where are all men what are we lifting up to the people are we lifting our little thing up to the people or are we lifting Christ up to the people we want to be lifting Christ up to the people so my question then for the message and you just happen to be sitting here so I'm preaching to you guys but my question question for the message is what book are you reading out of okay so brother brandom says now it's hard to say this it's very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way I do the way I have been for many years but since the opening of those Seven Seals of the mels just behind the the mountain Yonder this has become a new book it's the thing that's been hid has been revealed as God prom promised in Revelations 10 he would do it and we are the privileged people that God has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of God made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science but by God that it's right God as I have said before in a message God doesn't need anyone to interpret his word he is his own interpreter he says it'll happen at happens that's it he confirms it and he interprets it oh well what book became a new book so at the beginning think about it for a moment at the beginning what did the when he was standing out there and the angel came down and told him what do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry and so what did he do he took the book didn't say do the work of a prophet even though he was a prophet but it said do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry so what was he doing he was going out there healing discernments he would say thus sayeth the Lord and every time it come to pass sir right not once did it ever fail yet many Rose up behind them like he said and they would have they would be almost 99.9% there but there was an element there that when they said thus sayith the Lord something didn't happen right it's like brother brandom said if you if you have a vision and you out there and you tell the vision and the vision says it's a white man or a man in a white shirt and this and that and the other and and this is going to happen and it comes down and you watch it but the man had an orange shirt on it wasn't from God everything else happened exactly but that one thing shows that it wasn't from God but like brother Brown said you you get something like that in the Pentecostal people they all run to and flock to it even though there's an element of uh untruth to it because that's how people are now brother brandom said so I like that the new book so what was he doing he was going out and believe it or not the book was still closed so he was like don't get mad at me so he was just like Luther the book was closed but Luther was able to get a little bit of it and go oh I see the just shall live by faith right so he is able to grab a hold of that out of the book and preach that in the book and God opened up the just shall live by faith and you know we still believe what Luther preached amen the just shall live by faith I believe that why it was God's word and what did God start doing he started building on the just shall live by faith he started restoring back this word but it was closed it was only only what they could see so now brother bram's going out so brother bram's going out doing what God told him to do but he was reading in the book just like the rest of them trying to find something he would see something and he would bring them that little oh there's a loose in there and he'd bring it back and the truth would come out to the people so brother brownon was talking about in the vision of in the evening messenger he said here I was with the Pentecostals he had a vision he said he was standing in between two trees one tree was the Oneness one tree was the Trinity and those trees were great big trees but he said his tree was bigger and God had given him fruit off from both trees that followed out in this message so now remember take that just for a moment and then when brother random talks about the uh the fishes the three PS of the fishes yeah right you remember that and so he starts off with the deal and in the in the vision and he's looking out there and he's looking down there and there's this Lake and there's a bunch of fishermen preachers out there fishing and what were they doing they were fishing and they were catching Fish Little Fish and brother brandham said he could see out there and in the vision there was larger fish out there and he goes I'm a fisherman I can catch those so he goes down there he said the vision now he's standing there he has the fishing pole in his hand and he's the Angel's talking to him and said now here's what you do he said you pull you throw out there your lure he says you give it a little pull and he says you'll watch you know you wonder where he gets those the terminology first pull second pull third pull so he W watches and them little fish what do they do they start following that lure right and and so the angel tells him he says now you do it you you'll pull one more time he says then what'll happen is those little fish will scatter and it'll attract the attention of the big fish out in the deep and so what did he do he gets all excited right he gets like good fisherman and you're and uh right he gets any works and what happens all the line and everything comes up and he's all tangled up and the and the um Angel tells him what don't get your lines tangled up in these times right come on because I I'm I'm trying to build to a question I want to ask you so why then brothers and sisters did the sword not come in his hand in 1947 you ever think about that why did the sword not come in his hand in 1947 yeah it wasn't time and also he needed to learn to be a prisoner to God because what was he doing he said he was and this is his own words he was always doing things that the angel told him not to do right because in that message it also says I told you not to do that I know I'm sorry and what was he do he'd go to Africa with all them Minister brothers and what was he doing he was listening to them instead of what God told him to do he hadn't become that prisoner that God needed a prophet to be he had to become that prisoner he had had to become uh like he said everything Christ had to be preeminent in his life amen you know just like I've always thought and I always said you know it's way easier to say no to the devil than it is to say yes to God you know it it's hard sometimes to believe what God tells you we you know we say we're Believers and we would believe anything that Jesus told us would we did the disciples come I mean there they were think about it Jesus could tell us something directly and we wouldn't believe him you're like what what do you mean we wouldn't believe him well think about it at the Passover supper when Jesus told them said there's one among you that's going to betray me and they're like what who me am m is it me Lord am I going to betray you and what did Jesus tell him says well the one that's going to betray me is the one I'm going to give this piece of bread to he's going to betray me and he turned and he gave it to Judas and said go do what you need to do and they all still wondered is it me right you know how brother Brown said there's John laying on jesus' breast and Peter's like hey John me am I the one I mean it's crazy because that's just the way men's Minds The Way men's minds work but God knows all things just like we go I love this morning and I was just thinking that message um God rich in Mercy and we still get this wherever you go out but the first thing brother brandham does when he comes out he goes let's get away from the fear and scare of it he goes you're not someday are you going to be Sons and Daughters right now are we Sons and Daughters of God if you never were a son or daughter you never will be so why are you trying to work to be a son or daughter you either are or you aren't all right you know I liked how the brother was getting into it and how he was talking about you know God writing our names down in the book and I think sometimes people think that you know God was sitting there oh I think yeah brother Robert right brother Robert down looking oh brother William that's not it that's not how he was doing it no sir you know how he was doing it he was looking there right now brother window Brother Ray why because your names are engraved in the palms of his hands come on you have to be here to be there what is Redemption all about it's not oh God's going to come down and pick us up and take us someplace we've never been the only way you can be there is you had to be there before right that's how that's how Redemption works so this thought of the new book what book are you reading from Brother Bram says here immediately after that the angels of the Lord appeared and told about the seven trumpets or the seven SE seals that I was return back here to Jefferson Bill and preached the Seven Seals and there if anything said that was inspired it was in that there where the angel of the Lord met us in the Bible become a new Bible there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ allog together new to us but perfectly exactly with the scriptures that's what the word which has always been wow so it wasn't something different but what was it remember why like his brother said it wasn't time there was a time that this was to be open and youve ever thought oh I just I just love it uh you know how brother brandom said that that angel Earthly Angel would be on Earth at the same time Revelations 10:1 yes you ever think of it like that and then Here Comes brother Brown he's talking about he's up there in Sabino Canyon and he's praying and he has his arms up and what happened the sword came into his hand and he said his fit his hand just exactly you ever think about it Revelations 101 now this word was open and you see it and the angel reached down and placed it in the hand of his Prophet because it was open now and the word fit his hand exactly amen what draw drew you the voice not the signs and wonders The Voice Drew you the word Drew you that's what drew me I don't know what Drew you it wasn't the signs and wonders in hearing about all that but when you heard the word and it was open and it come perfect serpent seed that explains everything yeah I mean when you heard it did you like that sounds crazy no why because something it was open and you have an ear to hear when it's opened you are blessed because you have that ear but you have to hear what it was yeah it's just opened it all up when you read the church age book in the four horse riders it's like perfectly clear it wasn't you know the Holy Spirit going out on a white horse and like cupid and shooting arrows into people's hearts what that makes no sense whatsoever but people believe that it's just crazy but we don't why because we're not we're the ones reading let me read this to you we're the ones reading out of a different book but yet altogether it's the same book that everybody else was reading out of yeah right but only we know that it's been open right you know we're not the only ones that uh opened the Seven Seals or our Prophet there was other prophets David cares had wrote a book on the Seven Seals being know you see why because Satan tries to put off what God is trying to do like the brother was saying Satan knows God's plan amen he knows God's plan and he's going to thwart that plan all the time all right amen every chance he gets and we should be ready we should we should know these things amen you know I always think it's funny because I think about it in how we get sometimes but you know we think hey come here yeah you so this is how we think about it so you look at it as this is you and I'm Satan oh man oh he's so big I don't know you think you that's that but it's it's the truth but did you know it's the other way around this is Satan and this is you brother brandom told us when we get to the other side and you're going to look and you're going to go that was him I was afraid of that he caused me all that problem well I I I don't understand Lord yeah that's the truth that's like the I love that it's it's time to put Satan under your feet just like the brother said not be bowing down to everything he says you know it's like brother Brown I don't know but that's all right you know it's like brother Brown said Satan is more afraid of you than you are of him all right right right when the weakness of Christians gets down on their knees to pray he didn't just say the Devils he said Satan trembles because if you get a revelation of who you really are that's the truth then he has no power over you how does he have power over he Bluffs us into getting to think that he's bigger than we are and it's not we almost you know how people in before the book was open would look at the story of the um prodical son you know that's a beautiful story because I like the whole thing about it prodal son he was a son he never was not a son he was always a son right and when he went out there doing whatever going along and I mean we know the story so I don't like to keep but he goes out there and he's you know finally in the pig pin but what did he do the Bible says he come to himself he come to himself he realized what he wasn't part of that pig farm right but his dad oh brothers and sisters it's like I brother there in Anchor he's a deacon and he told us a long time ago he said but when he first came into the message and he was all one day he was standing in the GR in the line in the grocery waiting to pay for his food and he was looking around the people behind him and the people in front of him he said I was thinking I wonder if they know who they're standing next to I'm a Son of God Amen who are you sons of God Daughters of God I liked how the brother was getting in there and you I like that story of Satan tempting Jesus and he like he was saying and he tempts him this way and he tempts him that way and he tempts him like this and finally Jesus got enough of it right remember the scripture tells us let this mind that was in Christ being in you in the form of man thought it what not robbery to be what equal with God you know if you look it up brother brand said the only difference between Jesus and us Jesus believed who he was all right I love that scripture and finally he got tired of it got tired of Satan tempting him and he turned to Satan he said Satan it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God why because he knew who he was do we know who we are amen our communion scripture I love that many are sick among us not just naturally but physically why because we don't discern the body of the Lord right and I always like to give the example you know who likes to touch go who wants to touch God tonight raise your hands and every raise their hands no keep your hand up keep your hand up if you really want to touch God tonight just reach over and touch God because we are his body that's right we are his body that's who we are right the things brother Brown told us that was left undone when he was here we are are to fulfill yes sir amen okay so I tell you friends just what that we are members of the church or something like that doesn't mean too much to us you better buckle up that armor you better take the whole word of God and hold on to it and quit this Hollywood acting around here it's got right into the church and it's a shame Hollywood glows just makes a bright light and the church today is trying to compare with Hollywood Christ is not in Hollywood Christ is in the individual Hollywood glares while the gospel glows with humility God ain't in these great fine fancy places and all this stuff that we see he comes in the form of humility the form of meekness and gentleness and pass right through and if you're acquainted with the word you'll see it are you acquainted with the word what word the open word the open book not the closed book yeah the open word you have to be acquainted with the message right think about it brother brandom told us that he knew all along that the healings and the discernments was not his message his message was what the opening of the seals the opening of the word that was the seventh Angel's message but Satan doesn't want people to know that can I read you something out of the church age book okay good it's on page 375 brother bram's talking about the uh Philadelphia Church age and he says that the true church couldn't bring the false church back neither could the false Church get into the F to overcome the true church he says but the false Vine entrenched itself waiting for the last part of the last age when it would win all back to ex except that small flock that were the elect True Vine of God look up that word entrenched always started to do that when brother Brown says not all our English words mean what you think it means because and we're that way we get thinking a word means something and you look up the word and you're like wow I was way off right you know we think entrenched I'm going to dig a hole and I'm going to put something in it but that word entrench means to place someone or something in a very strong position that cannot be easily changed yeah and that's what Satan did at the beginning when God came and he started pulling all of those believers out of the Pentecostal Church age Satan got in there and started putting men in there and they he raised them up in positions of power How could a br How could a preacher that believes this message tell you that God opened the book then he closed it again but why would God open something and then close it he ain't going to do that why he sent a prophet to tell you something so what do they do they try to hold the people back from believing brother Bram says here what was it it's the blind leading the blind they won't come in neither will they let them that's under them come in you think it's God that doesn't want you to know that the book is open that's the truth it it it's not God wants you to know that's why he opened the word for you to know and I know that because you guys believe the open word it's not like you're out somewhere trying to tell these guys hey come come up higher you know the spirit says come up higher come up higher not stay down here but you go to these churches I've been to these churches and they don't want the people why would you not want the people to know right they get trained you know how they train an elephant they take him when he's a baby and they tie him with a chain or a big rope to a post and this elephant he gets out there when he gets to he when he's a baby he gets the end and he can't get away but they say when that elephant's a full grown elephant that what he could pull that post out of the ground like that but he's been trained not that he can't go no farther than that amen as we were saying earlier there's so many that come over here and only point to the signpost yeah well if you believe God sent a prophet you're all right that's all you have to believe I've heard it in my own ears just come to church we'll feed you lunch well that's not what church is about coming to feed you lunch the the church is about what dressing his bride to be ready for the wedding supper amen that's why this word was opened to be to dress Us in what he wants not what we want or what we think that's why I like the story of Esther right all the virgins were called and he called them all together and then he put his Chamberlain over him which we know Esther's was Hagi and what did I have he had access to where he spoke lip to ear with the king and the King told hegi what he expects from his Queen amen what he expects from his king queen and all the other all the other virgins they were virgins they all had their own idea they had their own thoughts oh maybe you know I like red so I'm going to put the red hat on and I'm going to do this I'm going to make myself up this way oh I like it this way and I like the big you understand what I'm saying they put their own thoughts to what hey was trying to tell them so when it was their turn to come before the king what happened they were rejected but if you read it they weren't put out and just thrown onto the street but they were put in the second house but there was one who listened and did exactly what hegi told him to do right we've had our hegy today amen I go into places and I look out there and all I see is Christians I look out there and I think man you guys know more than I know I don't know anything and then I started putting together because the natural types the spiritual right so in the natural as we were saying brother brandham said God what we are Sons and Daughters now we always were we always will be right now I like to do this when some of my children are here but you think about it you take your children and you can do a blood test right they can prick the fingers and put your thing out there and they'll come back no matter how much they don't want to be your child anymore but it'll come back says no I'm sorry but yeah raise your father what oh man but just cuz I have kids tell me right there's no getting around it ra you know I'm I'm their father because the blood test tells it they'll never get away and that's how we are brothers and sisters take the blood test you're a child of God you are a son and daughter of God but now there's a difference my wife now my wife is closer to me than All My Children right I don't wouldn't let my kids run all over my wife she's my wife come on she's supposed to be part of me but as a wife if you go into invisible Union brother Brown talks about it but she has certain things that she has to do and can't do if she breaks brother Brown says breaks those virtues are something she ceases to be your wife but you can come and she could go oh but that's my husband I'm part of that well take a blood test you see Esther had certain things that she had to do to prove that she was the wife amen that's how we are as the bride we have certain things certain things that God has for us that we are supposed to do that we are supposed to manifest and if we break those things it's not that you don't go to heaven you're Sons and Daughters of God you you've you you were already there and I'm not even going to say you've already made it you're just going back to from what you came from amen but God is expecting certain things from those that call the wife okay amen because the naturals du type if he's a father we can look and see how he treats his children we should treat it that way way we can look and see how as a husband how he treats we can look in the Bible and see what he does to wives that are not faithful amen and I just want to be faithful and I'm glad that God gave me an ear to hear what the spirit has said that I know what God is expecting from me why because I heard what he gu said and I'm going to do what that guy says oh here's that is so what happened then brother brand says and according to the scriptures there has got to be another church age rais and when it did the Philadelphia Church age rais John Wesley and what had happened kept coming Westward all the time and when it happened there was the church agent John Wesley raised up but Luther could not receive it because they had already organized to justification he could not accept sanctification and what happened in our day the people accepted the prophets signs and wonders but not the prophet's message what happened they already had these coming out had already organized who God sent a prophet not what was the prophet's message so when they came they couldn't this just like I always wonder people are expecting the prophet to come back I don't think they want him to come back not the way they're thinking just listen to the message the way of a true Prophet I just think of that how brother Bram talks about Amos coming up over the hill and when he started to look out there and seeing what his message had become his eyes turned to fire yeah they don't want him oh let me read this to you he says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I've never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men amen and that should be the whole focus of the ministry it's not to build ourselves up not to build our church up not to build some organization up but what to build the people up to get them into that real spiritual relationship amen that's what if he did that then that's what I should be doing like brother Ram said about Paul he said every Minister should we might not get there but everyone should look back and try to be like Paul was and what was Paul he was a prisoner to this word and that's what we want to see you know your pastor would have a lot easier time if we could just get that relationship between between us and God that's right and we go to God before we go to the pastor and that's what God wants is he wants you to come to him you to believe his word you to do I feel sorry for the pastors I'm glad I'm not a pastor they have a hard job yeah I mean you think you you got a bunch of problems and then multiply that by the next guy and the next guy and the next guy and you lay that all upon him instead of going to God right I don't expect my wife to call her brother or friend to talk to me I expect my wife to come and talk to me God's the same way he's expecting us to go to come to him amen okay he says you're not blind people you're sensible people and as I stood there and said those things for prejudice I say it's because it's life because I'm responsible to God for saying it and I must say it and my message all the time knowing back there under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is and them Seven Seals opened those Mysteries and showing those things is what's happened amen so brother brandom knew all the time that he was coming up doing the work of an evangelist that wasn't his message his message was the opening of the seals his message was the word being open the sword in the hand that he could come and tell us but the king said amen that's what the whole message is about God trying to speak to each individual I like how brother brandom says God gives the orders and you pack them out God speaks to you we need to do what God tells us to do not be indecisive God gives us the orders we pack them out one of my favorite quotes he says Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruit of those that slept and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there'll be a sheath waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheath yes what was the sheath the first one to come to mature the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheath so we know that Christ when he was F when he came as brother Bram saying when he came and he rose again he was showing like the brother was talking about job I like that he was showing that death can't hold you yeah he was showing that death is nothing like but a vehicle to take us to where we want to go always like that and I you know we we grieve over somebody that left and died but you know what I bet you if you talk to her today she don't want to come back I mean we should be happy that they got to go over there before us we should be jealous that they got to go over there always in my mind in brother Brown's first wife died and he's sitting there talking she had little kids she had a baby and what Billy Paul was 18 months old and you know how mothers are with little kids and she did not want to come back say B why'd you call me back everything you talked about yeah okay oh man it's even more than we could think it's even more than we can think so we found in our day I like the wave sheath the the thing about the wave sheath that they would look out there the priests would look out there and there'd be a little corner of the the wheat field that would come to mature first to show what a mature wheat was supposed to be and what it was supposed to look like and they would do what they would take the wheat and wave it over the people to say when your crop looks like this it's ready for Harvest all right and that's what we as ministers are supposed to do we are supposed to take the message and say this is what a Christian looks like this is what a Christian does and wave it over the people to know that when we become that it's time for the Harvest it's time for the Harvest I'm I'm ready to get out of here I'm tired of being here you know it's like everybody says and you listen to them and you know when I first came in I didn't think my kids would have to go the Rapture was going to happen and man now it's 35 plus years later you know like brother Brown said about Israel aren't they tired of going around the mountain going around the mountain going around the mountain going around the mountain it's time to go home I'm just one that believes like brother Bram says you know well we're waiting on Jesus but Jesus is waiting on us many many times brother brandom said the Rapture should have already taken place all right what is hindering us what is hindering us you say that last one to come in but how do you know the last one isn't one of these right I I I love kids I have a a heart for kids cuz how do you know it's not this young guy here in the gray shirt what if he's the last one what if he's the last one you're smiling are you the last one okay hurry up we want to go home come on come on Amen I am ready to go home there should be nothing tying us to this world right but we get ourselves B bolted down too much you ever think about that story we sound as good you know oh yeah the magnet's going to come by and but there's some that are still bolted down that shouldn't be bolted down to this world that's right and like the scripture says that God's only longsuffering for a certain amount of time yeah and then him that's filthy will be filthy still him that's holy will be holy still we need to unbolt ourselves from this world there should be nothing in this world more important than going home you know as I always tell people for me I'm the worst person for things what do we need things for oh I needed a new boat because I like to go fishing why well I needed a motor home because I don't want to camp in a tent why right why do we need these things brother brand said you know well the Bible says in the beginning they did what they sold everything they have to follow I know you're like what I don't but we should have that attitude it's not wrong to have things but if things is the thing that you are going after that's what's wrong right whatever God wants to give us that's what we want but things is is to me is holding us back because we got to have this thing and that thing and if I can just oh wait till my next vacation's over before you come Lord I tell you what I'd rather vacation over there than vacation here that's where we want to be is on the other side amen let's stand what's that song when I take my vacation in heaven that's better than any Cruise you could go on even to tell people man take a cruise to Alaska it's better than that it aren't you tired of being here it sounds good but we we need to I think start moving that way hey Lord I'm tired because remember God sent Moses and I believe that it was when God does something it's time for something to happen God sent Moses to deliver Israel but what the unbelief of the people had to wait 40 more years to be delivered and then brother Brown said it wasn't until the people started crying out to God for deliverance I think it's time we need to start saying God I'm tired of this place you know let's oh God pay my bill forget that say god let's get us out of here and then you won't have to worry about your bills cuz you won't be here I want to go home you know maybe you just think oh you're just old and you're thinking that well no I wanted to go home a long time ago I was ready to go home I said well I got my whole life ahead no you don't you got all of eternity ahead of you that's your life this isn't your life come on you might think it's your life but it's not we're supposed to what give our life to him to live his life through us you see I think that's not here I'm just talking generally that's one of the things brother brandom said as Christians we are what supposed to reflect the the spirit of the world of our rebirth in other words when you're born again it's from somewhere else we're not born again from this world we're born again from heaven we should reflect the things in in heaven many of the things that are here probably 99.9% of them are not going to be in heaven not going to be in heaven father as we come before you we know sometimes father things just don't come the way we would think as preachers father but we have to believe that you will direct your word to each heart for what they need for the day that we live in and father we know you Senter Prophet for a reason and we know he told us it was to dress the bride with this word and we as your ministry Lord are to take this word give it to the people father that they could be dressed for your coming the duty of us as ministers father not to lift ourselves up not to make us of some great ministry father but it's to lift you up before the people that they would see you father and you did this Lord by opening your word to us so I always wonder what book are most people reading out of do we look at things through the open word or are we still looking at the signpost wondering where we're going how long we're going to be to get there and we know father that the Rapture cycle has already started Lord just want to be ready the things that you told hegi to tell us Lord that's what we want to be father we want to do those things we want to be found ready as he said to be presented before you as a Chase virgin and we have no Creeds or dogmas or anything attached father but it's just this word that you've revealed to us how thankful we are Lord that you have given us ears to hear and not only that father but you've given us an understanding you've given us a heart father to want to serve you and help us Lord as we go forward to Endeavor more as the brother said we need this morning to get back to our first love the way that we were when you first revealed yourself to us have that Zeal as the young ones do father being old we should never lose that Zeal just help us Lord we know time is short we want to be ready Lord all of us here father we don't come because we don't want to be ready I don't believe anybody here comes because they just want to be seen but they come to hear from you that we would be changed into that image just love you father just be with my brothers and sisters here Lord we just appreciate brother Wendell so much just pray you just continue father anoint his ministry to get the people Lord ready and prepared father for we know it's going to that change is in the moment and the twinkling of the eye Love You Lord appreciate you and we thank you that we had this time just help us now Lord to go through and go forth and let's remember these things we've heard today father let us dwell on them Lord draw closer to you we ask it in Jesus name amen oh how I just want to be like God and it's possible you know I always think if brother Brandon was our wave sheep to show and we know we're not talking about the gift that he had that comes once to an age but he's talking about the life that brother brandom lived we can live that life that same life because it's the same holy spirit amen Same Spirit that anointed him to live the life anoints us I know it sounds crazy but I always wonder when was the last time somebody mistakened you for Jesus Christ do you live that kind of a life before the people you say it's impossible it's not impossible because if his Spirit dwells in you and you've allowed him to have preeminence in your life then that spirit will live through you it's like brother Brown said if Dillinger was in you you would rob banks right if some great artist Michelangelo was in you you would paint paintings you would make sculptures well how about if Jesus Christ lives in you the works that I do you shall do also amen God bless [Applause] [Music] you [Music] is to [Music] the be at his will in every way in his presence [Music] found hear say what oh yes my Lord I just want to please the Lord be in his will in every way to be [Music] lost to hear him say Well [Music] done hallelujah I'm so glad that God come to open the book I like when brother uh brother Craig Bo had come to minister and someone had asked him something a visitor had asked about you know what what's his stand on the message and um and he's you know um do you believe that the Bible I he she says I believe the Bible will get me home and and um and then we just read we just read the the good things that the prophet said and and uh she says so isn't that right do you are you believe you have to believe the message or believe the Bible and and I'd like to say I liked his response his his response was he says well do you want an open book or do you want a closed book and uh he says if you want a closed book then just go ahead and read your Bible and don't worry about the prophet's message but if you want an open book if you want to understand what this book says well you might want to go ahead and listen to the prophet so those guys that's always trying to separate this message and the Bible and trying to make it two different Deals they they first of all they have no understanding of an open book they have no understanding of what the seals were all about they're all still back in the first and the second pools and and uh and the Miracles and things like that the Miracles and the healings and the discernments thankful for them but they have zero zal effect upon my belief system my belief system is that God sent us a prophet and those words of Life have so affected me and so changed me can you say amen amen so when you get a proper revelation of the message the message and the the Bible it's all combined you'll never separate it and when you get a proper revelation of that you'll never separate Jesus from his word it's all the same aren't you glad for that Hallelujah the prophet never tried to pull us to himself never did he pull us to himself amen and neither should any preacher in this message no man should ever pull any of God's bride to himself amen Hallelujah we are Unix at the Master's service amen we are simply here to feed God's bride and to give her the words of life we have nothing in ourselves this bride should not be manhandled by any preacher amen she is his and his alone and I'm just glad that God's allowed me Amen to clothe her in this word and and to give her of His abundant word and life I I'm thankful for that today amen do you enjoy brother Ray's messeng here tonight [Music] amen amen yes I I want I want that in my heart I want

and you'll never really get that until you truly see that it is your name in the book and you are the one that's unsealed and brother brandom actually said that in the revealing of this book you found that the believer is the pages of the book The Believer is the book you've been unsealed you've God has opened it all up for you to see who you are Hallelujah and then and then when Jesus is asking
