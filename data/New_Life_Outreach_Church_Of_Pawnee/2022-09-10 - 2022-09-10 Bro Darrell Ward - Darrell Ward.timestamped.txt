[1:12:05] god bless you you'll be seated
[1:12:10] he told me what to look for
[1:12:14] you know god who is rich in mercy
[1:12:18] has always gave instructions to his
[1:12:20] people so that they would not error in
[1:12:24] the way that they should go
[1:12:26] you know paul told us in thessalonians
[1:12:28] he said but i would not have you to be
[1:12:31] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[1:12:33] are asleep
[1:12:35] that you sorrow not even as others who
[1:12:37] have no hope
[1:12:39] paul said i don't want you to be dumb
[1:12:41] about this thing
[1:12:42] but i want you to understand who we
[1:12:45] serve
[1:12:46] i want you to understand that even
[1:12:48] though our loved ones may go by the way
[1:12:51] of the grave they are not dead
[1:12:55] and we do not weep as those who have no
[1:12:57] hope
[1:12:58] i do not want you to be ignorant
[1:13:02] now we find in luke chapter 2
[1:13:05] that he sent angels to the shepherds who
[1:13:07] was watching over their flocks by night
[1:13:10] and the angel of the lord came unto them
[1:13:13] and and the glory of the lord shone
[1:13:15] around about them and they were afraid
[1:13:18] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:13:21] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[1:13:24] great joy which shall be to all people
[1:13:27] for unto you born this day in the city
[1:13:30] of david a savior which is christ the
[1:13:34] lord
[1:13:35] and this shall be a sign unto you
[1:13:38] you shall find the babe wrapped in
[1:13:41] swaddling cloths lying in a manger
[1:13:45] and it came to pass as the angels were
[1:13:48] going away into the heavens that the
[1:13:50] shepherd said to one another let us now
[1:13:52] go even unto bethlehem and see this
[1:13:56] thing which has come to pass which the
[1:13:59] lord hath made known unto us
[1:14:03] now notice they didn't go to the king's
[1:14:05] palace
[1:14:07] they didn't go to a high dollar inn
[1:14:09] they didn't go to the ritz carlton
[1:14:12] they didn't go to some resort for the
[1:14:14] elite
[1:14:15] why why didn't they go there because
[1:14:17] they knew he wasn't there
[1:14:21] but the bible said with haste they found
[1:14:23] mary and joseph and the baby lying in a
[1:14:26] manger
[1:14:29] and i could just see mary
[1:14:32] said how did you find us
[1:14:34] how did you know we were here
[1:14:37] and the lady might have said to mary he
[1:14:42] the angel he told us what to look for
[1:14:48] you want to find jesus in your day look
[1:14:50] to where the angel messenger says that
[1:14:53] he's at
[1:14:55] we've had an angel messenger to tell us
[1:14:58] where he's at in the hour that we're
[1:14:59] living in
[1:15:01] that's where you will find him you'll
[1:15:03] not find him in a denomination you'll
[1:15:05] not find him in an organization you'll
[1:15:07] not find him in an educational program
[1:15:10] he's not there
[1:15:13] but you'll find him in the baptism of
[1:15:15] the holy ghost amen
[1:15:18] that's the only place you'll find him
[1:15:23] i was out in the
[1:15:24] back field the other day praying
[1:15:27] my burden for the young people
[1:15:29] seemed like so many of them were
[1:15:30] slipping out
[1:15:33] and i was praying to the lord and
[1:15:36] i felt like he spoke to me
[1:15:39] and so are we just getting them to shout
[1:15:42] out
[1:15:42] or are we getting them to christ
[1:15:48] and he said go ask
[1:15:50] them are you in the message
[1:15:54] or is the message in you
[1:15:57] because you see if you're just in this
[1:15:59] message
[1:16:01] somebody will talk you out of it
[1:16:04] but if the message is in you oh hell
[1:16:07] can't get it out of you
[1:16:11] that's what will keep our young people
[1:16:13] it's that life amen that's where he's at
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:17] don't look for him where he's not don't
[1:16:20] waste your time looking for him where
[1:16:22] he's not just look for him where he's at
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:29] he sent prophets
[1:16:31] with eagle vision
[1:16:33] who could raise up and they would be
[1:16:35] able to see
[1:16:37] the things that are to come
[1:16:40] and look and fall off they can begin to
[1:16:42] cry
[1:16:43] and he would give his people insight
[1:16:46] to things that are to be
[1:16:49] he would tell them what to look for
[1:16:52] i think of the mighty prophet isaiah
[1:16:55] who was caught up in the spirit
[1:16:57] and he began to cry out the voice of him
[1:17:00] that crieth in the wilderness
[1:17:02] prepare you the way of the lord make
[1:17:05] straight in the desert highway
[1:17:08] for our god
[1:17:10] 712
[1:17:13] years later
[1:17:20] the pharisees came from jerusalem into
[1:17:23] the desert
[1:17:25] asking john who are you
[1:17:30] they sent the priests and the levites
[1:17:32] from jerusalem said who are you
[1:17:34] and he confessed and he denied not but
[1:17:37] he said i am not the christ
[1:17:40] and they ask him who are you then
[1:17:43] art thou that elias she said no i am not
[1:17:46] i found that prophet he answered no
[1:17:49] they said unto him then who are you
[1:17:52] that we may give an answer to them that
[1:17:55] sent us what saith thou of thyself and
[1:17:58] he said ah
[1:18:01] and the voice of one crying in the
[1:18:03] wilderness makes straight the way of the
[1:18:06] lord
[1:18:08] as saith the prophet isaiah i am
[1:18:11] isaiah's prophecy fulfilled
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:16] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:18:19] your ears
[1:18:22] god told them what to look for he was
[1:18:24] the very vindication of isaiah's
[1:18:26] prophecy
[1:18:28] his teaching his nature his character
[1:18:32] they even came from jerusalem to the
[1:18:35] wilderness to see him
[1:18:38] the very words of the prophet
[1:18:41] was made flesh and was standing right
[1:18:44] before them
[1:18:48] he could stand there
[1:18:49] and say it's me
[1:18:52] isaiah was speaking of me
[1:18:56] how could they have missed it
[1:18:59] how could they have missed it when he
[1:19:01] told them what to look for
[1:19:05] but jesus said you hypocrites
[1:19:08] you blind leaders of the blind
[1:19:11] i sent you prophets i told you what to
[1:19:14] look for through those prophets and you
[1:19:16] stoned them
[1:19:18] oh jerusalem jerusalem thou that kill us
[1:19:21] the prophets and stone them with your
[1:19:23] sin unto thee how oft i would have
[1:19:25] gathered you under my wings
[1:19:29] but you would not
[1:19:32] i would have loved you i would have
[1:19:33] protected you i would have spread my
[1:19:36] skirt over you
[1:19:38] which you
[1:19:39] would
[1:19:40] god
[1:19:41] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:19:45] stephen told them there in books acts
[1:19:47] chapter seven
[1:19:49] stephen said he sent you prophets to
[1:19:51] tell you what to look for before the
[1:19:54] just one come but what did you do you
[1:19:56] persecuted and you stoned them and now
[1:19:59] you have betrayed
[1:20:01] and killed the very one they said would
[1:20:04] come
[1:20:08] they were blinded by the creeds their
[1:20:11] self-righteousness
[1:20:13] the religion
[1:20:15] the pride
[1:20:20] i could just see on that day in
[1:20:21] jerusalem
[1:20:23] when the prophecy of zechariah was being
[1:20:25] fulfilled
[1:20:27] they might have been sitting around the
[1:20:28] table finishing their lunch
[1:20:30] and him i said honey let's get a scroll
[1:20:33] let's read from the scroll
[1:20:35] let's read from zechariah today
[1:20:38] and he pulls it out
[1:20:39] rejoice
[1:20:41] oh greatly
[1:20:43] oh
[1:20:44] daughter of zion shallow daughter of
[1:20:47] jerusalem behold that king cometh unto
[1:20:50] thee he has just been having salvation
[1:20:52] lowly and riding upon an ass upon the
[1:20:55] coat the fold of an ass and as they were
[1:20:57] reading the scroll they hear a noise
[1:21:01] and they look up over the scroll and
[1:21:03] they see him come riding into the city
[1:21:11] and no doubt he said to his wife
[1:21:14] who is this
[1:21:18] the bible said in matthew 21 when he was
[1:21:20] coming to jerusalem oh the city was
[1:21:23] moved saying who is this
[1:21:26] the city they might have not known
[1:21:30] they didn't know who it was even though
[1:21:32] it was the very word for their hour
[1:21:35] being manifested
[1:21:36] they did not know but they were son
[1:21:39] there oh glory to god who got the
[1:21:42] revelation
[1:21:44] why
[1:21:45] because zechariah told them what to look
[1:21:48] for
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:51] and when they saw
[1:21:53] zechariah's words made flesh they said
[1:21:56] it's him
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:03] the city of pauline may not know the
[1:22:06] city of tulsa may not know claremore may
[1:22:08] not know but there are some here this
[1:22:11] morning
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:14] we know
[1:22:15] we know
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:21] the prophets prophecy has become flesh
[1:22:24] and by revelation what is revelation
[1:22:27] faith
[1:22:31] we can say
[1:22:34] this is jesus
[1:22:43] if you want to see jesus
[1:22:45] you've got to see him
[1:22:47] in the form
[1:22:48] he said he would appear in
[1:22:51] in the day
[1:22:52] you're living
[1:22:56] if someone come through that door
[1:22:58] dragging across bleeding
[1:23:01] people would scream
[1:23:03] men would faint
[1:23:05] and that wouldn't even be jesus
[1:23:09] i don't want to hurt your catholic
[1:23:10] feelings but that wouldn't be jesus
[1:23:12] he's already done that
[1:23:14] he'll never do it again they'll never
[1:23:17] nail him to a cross again he's already
[1:23:19] fulfilled that
[1:23:22] so if you're going to see christ in your
[1:23:23] day you've got to see the word for your
[1:23:26] hour made flesh when you find the word
[1:23:29] for your hour made flesh you have found
[1:23:32] jesus regardless of the skin color

[1:24:23] about it
[1:24:26] he said about a month before that vision
[1:24:28] brother branham called me
[1:24:30] and told me
[1:24:32] about the vision
[1:24:34] you know what he said
[1:24:35] it meant nothing
[1:24:37] to me
[1:24:38] it was just a vision

[1:24:41] because he didn't think he was a part of
[1:24:43] it
[1:24:45] [Music]

[1:24:49] defeated
[1:24:50] because you don't realize you're a part
[1:24:52] of it
[1:24:54] you're letting the devil lie to you
[1:24:56] you're letting the devil tell you
[1:24:57] something that you're not you need to
[1:24:59] look in the word and see what the word
[1:25:01] says you is
