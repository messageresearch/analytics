under expectation I seen this quote today and I hope you don't mind me reading it as we get ready for the man of God it says Satan fights harder everything goes wrong seemingly because Satan is trying to keep that people in tension and everything else so that he can keep them away from this great time of strain that we are now entering into for the great as we would say go in for the kill now but he says he's already beat up in the corner he's already been exposed all of his devices are exposed and men and women has accepted Jesus Christ as their savior people with cancer and tumors and everything else have been healed doctor's statements proving that it is true he said now here sets a group of people tonight Sitting Waiting under great anticipation he said and and Satan if he can interrupt your mind that's all he has to do he said but now let go in for the great kill to drive Satan and all of his powers Plum out of this building that God can have the right away and he'll every sick person for the glory of God I believe we can do that here tonight that this doesn't have to be an average Wednesday night where we come in tired we go out tired but if you have an expectation and anticipation in your life God can meet the needs how many has a need upon your life tonight God can meet the need no matter what it may be as the men of God gums can we sing this now Turn Your Eyes Upon [Music] J Jus look for in his wonderful [Music] face and the things of the earth will [Music] St de with the life of his glory can we go up the key to f oh now turn your eyes can we do that for a little bit tonight Jesus look [Music] for strange [Music] di his glory Grace can we sing that again [Music] now turn your eyes on J Jesus look for in his [Music] Hallelujah and the things of Earth will grow strange lead him in the light of his glory and grace amen there's only one direction to look and that's up amen what an assurance to know no matter what is happening around us no matter how evil the world is you know uh the Bible would tell us there was only one window in the ark and that was up wasn't looking at all the carcasses wasn't looking at how the how high the waters were wasn't looking about what was going on around they only have their eyes their intention on one thing that was the promise and my God has given us a promise we get tired we get weary we go through battles we go through circumstances but when we see these things coming to pass then look up for a Redemption draweth nigh amen what an assurance to have this evening if you have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Daniel 1 and8 and also Daniel 11:32 I'm just going to continue on my subject that I was preaching on last time the people that know their God um it's going to be simple tonight so I hope it hope it can be a blessing in in some way but Daniel 1 and8 and before we read come we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for bringing us together tonight Lord bringing us together safely father Lord you kept kept us safe throughout the week Lord throughout our our day at work today Father and Lord as we've sang songs of Zion Lord we've sang songs of worship father Lord brother kby has Lord created an atmosphere Lord through worship for your word to Falling father and Lord as we come into this part of the service I ask that you would anoint us Father Here anoint the speaker anoint the hearer father Lord may we come together in unity tonight Lord and hear what your spirit has for us Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen amen Daniel 1 and8 and I went over some of these things last time so just just bear with me but the the Bible would say but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of King's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the Unix and the prince of the Unix said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the King which hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces and worse liken than the children which are of your sword and then shall ye make me in danger of my head to the king then said Daniel to melzar whom the prince of the Unix had said over Daniel hananiah Mel and Azariah prove thy servants I beseech thee 10 days let them give us pulse to eat water to drink then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that ate of the portion of the king's meat as thou see us deal with thy servants so he can see Ed to them in this matter and prove them 10 days and at the end of the 10 days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh and all the children which did eat the portion of King's meat th melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill and all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding and all visions and dreams now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the unic brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the king communed with him among them all was found none like Daniel hananiah Mel Azariah therefore stood they before the king and all manners of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them he found them 10 times better than all the magicians the astrologers that were all in his realm my what a testimony amen Daniel 11:32 and said as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits amen you may be seated tonight like I said I'm just going to continue on my my thought on the people that know their God and we see that it was the favor of God that would separate these boys from the rest of the Kingdom they was the Covenant people they didn't choose themselves but God had chose them and since there was favor among them there was understanding that was was brought to them and that understanding would set them apart from the rest of the children and the Bible would say in Daniel 921 yay while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening ablation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment come forth and I have come down to show thee and and I love this part of the scripture for thou were greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision the angel says I am come forth to give thee skill and understanding for thou are greatly beloved and since your beloved therefore understand and that word beloved means greatly loved and dear to the heart and so since Daniel was dear to the heart of God there was understanding that was brought to him cuz not everybody was visited by an Angel not everybody had a visitation but since there was a favoris over Daniel there was an understanding that was brought to them and I think my in this generation since we are favored among all of the other people we are we are dear to the heart of God we have been separated by understanding not by a head knowledge not by an intellectual conception but we've got an understanding in this generation that has separated us from the rest of the world and brother Brandon would say this now when mckz was on Earth he was nothing in the world but the Jehovah God made manifest by creation he was here like in a theophany Abraham met him once in his tent and we said this morning Abraham recognized him and he told Abraham what he was going to do because he was not going to leave the air of the world blind to the things that he was going to do may I stop here for a minute to say God still has the same opin opinion about his church you're not children of Darkness you're children of light and and and we who blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth and with God who acted to Abraham who was to inherit the earth and he would say I will not keep these things back from the man that is going to inherit the earth how much more will he reveal a secrets to his church that is going to inherit the earth and I thought that is amazing God says I'm not going to hide anything from Abraham because he's going to inherit the earth and brother Brandon would say what about the now the spiritual seed that is going to inherit the earth not because of a of a blood lineage but because of a supernatural lineage how much more is God going to reveal a secret understanding to that generation to that group of people so that's what it's going to separate the two groups is knowing their God by a revelation knowing their God by understanding this group is beloved they're loved by God you see Genesis 12:1 would say now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing so Abraham's visitation wasn't to just call him out wasn't just to to bring standing but it was to call him out to produce exploits and I don't believe we're just here on Earth to to be called a message believer to say we believe Malachi for but I believe we're on Earth with a greater purpose than that we're not on Earth to fill up Pew but we're on on Earth to produce exploits the actions of Faith the actions of the Supernatural and that's what God was telling Abraham I am separating you I'm calling you out from your Kindred I'm calling you out from from your Homeland and I am going to make thee a great nation in other words this separation is going to bring a covenant and this Covenant is going to bring forth exploits and I think my God has given us a message in this generation that is separated a people that was called by his grace and it's producing the exploits of Faith it's producing the Supernatural and their everyday walk you see the people of the world is wanting a living God but right here in the midst of a chaotic time there was somebody that is beloved and is producing exploits oh Hallelujah so this visitation upon Abraham was God's favor upon Abraham brother Brandon would say now the first thing I want you to know that when God in Genesis 12 caught Abraham it was by elction it wasn't because Abraham was good it wasn't because Abraham deserved it and I think I'm so thankful it's not because we're good it's not because we deserve it but it's because we're close we're dear to the heart of God we come from his mind and brother Brandon will continue on to say it it was because God chose Abraham not Abraham choosing God it was God choosing Abraham and that's the way he calls the seed too now you not not what you want to be not him that willth or him that runneth but God that showeth Mercy is that scripture certainly it's not what you want to be it's what God chose you to be and I think my when we was running from the grace of God we didn't want nothing to do with with Christianity or the the life of a Christian you know he still called us he still chose us not because we wanted it to be but God chose us to be and it's not because we deserved it but it's because we are beloved it and once you realize you are beloved you realize you are called for a purpose and the Bible tell us I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people and be ye not partakers of her sins and you receive not of her plagues and so there there there's exploits that the world is producing they're producing sins and they're and they're receiving plagues but at the same time there's another group that is not partaking of their exploits but they're taking on the Supernatural and is producing the life of Jesus Christ there was an understanding that has called The Bride out of a church and plac them in the Supernatural you see like I said about Lazarus the last time because he was in a grave he lost all of his inheritance he lost everything that was rightfully his but the same voice the C his identity back to him restored him to all of his possessions it was because he was favored oh come on now not because of his name not because of his wealth not because of what he could achieve but because he was favored that brought the voice of Resurrection to his tomb and brought him back to his identity and his rightful inheritance and this the message has brought an understanding that I'm not meant for a tomb I'm not meant for a cemetery I'm meant to be brought to my true identity and with that identity becomes exploits with that identity comes the supernatural oh my but you see it's an understanding of who we are you know if you never understand who you are you're never going to understand what is yours you're never going to understand what belongs to you and you know I I remember growing up and just to tell a tell a quick story on Caleb I remember growing up and Caleb was always telling me I was adopted and you know and that really messed with my mind I thought I was adopted he said I they picked me up on the side of the road you know and I was growing up as a little kid and I thinking I belonged not thinking that that that I was loved and because of that second guessing in my mind I didn't realize I had a father that loved me you see what I'm talking about if you never understand that God has called you in this generation and loves you you you got a position inside of the Kingdom you're never going to rise to your full potential and if the devil can keep you from making this message God's favor on you you'll never see who you really are but this message is your true identity I'm not just the heir of one the Martin but I'm the care of Jesus Christ and everything that Christ had belongs to me and you see God seen me before I was ever in a fallen State God seen me in my true position you see why did Jesus say to Nathaniel and in John 1:47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and he and saith un saith of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no gal and Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest thou me and Jesus answered and said unto him before that philli called thee when thou was under the tree I saw thee and so before Nathaniel ever had a chance to come in contact with the supernatural God had already saw him before he was ever called by a minister before a preacher ever got up and and preached a sermon before you ever heard a message before you ever realized your position God already saw you and oh my that's a revelation that this message has brought to us that I wasn't I didn't become seed at the new birth I was already a son and since I was already a son there was a calling to me oh Hallelujah I don't believe that Philip went to Nathaniel by accident but he was led by the spirit to philli or to Nathaniel saying come on come see the Messiah it was because God already saw him that there was somebody else that was willing to spread the gospel and oh my every time the fivefold ministry get sits up and preaches a message preaches a word teaches a word and there's somebody receiving it it's because God already saw you before the foundation of the world before the addictions before the Fallen State before all the things you went through God already saw you and since he saw you he gave you an opportunity to receive an understanding oh my and that understanding is to produce exploits you see what did Jesus tell him he in John 1:50 Jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than these in other words I'm not just revealing to you that I always knew you but because of that understanding you're going to see exploits and oh this message didn't just bring us the Revelation it brought us the superatural it brought us the power of the resurrection and it's more than just it's more than just a head knowledge it's a reality in every one of our Lives you see brother Brandon would say this they say the days of Miracles has passed and all of these things let them prove it I'll give you an everlasting sign the super sign oh yes now he could have come an angel he could have come in whatever he wished to but he choose to come as Abraham's seed amen Abraham's super seed that's right that way he come that CH he chose to come to show in this last day God's Super Signs a super race oh yes not what you call a super race but what God calls a super race because they got what the supernatural power with Supernatural SS through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word he is saying what is bringing this Supernatural what is raising up a super race is a supernatural belief in a supernatural word this understanding that we got in this generation is the supernatural that is going to change our bodies one day that is going to change and it's changing our likes today or dislikes it's changing as the moing us into the image that he had before us oh remember that image he saw before the world began and he saw you this the message is shaping us into that image hallelujah it's the supernatural that has come with the supernatural word and he continues on to say from a through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural God he says you talk about super woo Supernatural God in a supernatural body in a natural people giving Supernatural signs Hallelujah a super race they that know their God shall do exploits great exploits show Supernatural signs of people Abraham's seed oh my and I love how brother Brandon puts it he says they say the days of Miracles as passed and he says let let them prove it he says if they say the Miracles was passed let them prove it and brother Brandon would say in another place the greatest Miracle is a life that has been transformed you see the world can the the greatest theologians the greatest atheists can debate scripture they can debate the message they can debate and say the cloud never happened that the pillar of fire didn't appear over brother brandom's head that it's idolatry to have a picture up and things like that they can try to disprove those things but the greatest Miracle the greatest Paradox the greatest exploits that Christ has on the Earth today is the supernatural inside of a vessel inside of a body let them debate pictures let them debate quotes let them debate scripture but they cannot debate a life that has been changed by a supernatural belief in a supernatural word that has come to a supernatural race let them say what they want to let them say this the this Prophet is false but it's changed our life it's changed New Life outreaches his life and and it's Authority oh come on now you knew where you was before this message came to you you knew where you was you was a drunk you was an alcoholic you was an addict you was a blasphemer whatever you was but the supernatural word had come to a people that was dear to the heart of God to bring forth exploits to bring forth a life that the devil don't know what to do with hallelujah oh it's the greatest Miracle they they they can't debate that oh how let him say what they want to but there's something that's happened inside of the life of the believer and brother Brandon would say the word the evening message must carry evening results oh that's plain and simple must carry evening results so the bride that God had in his mind that was spotless and blameless an invincible Army Marching In step and If This Were word has come to get his condition for that Vision there's nothing the devil can do to keep this evening message from producing the results that God had in his mind oh let him try let him say what they want to but something that's quickened on the inside of the believer it's the results of the word inside of a life it's the greatest miracle that is upon the Earth today hallelujah it's the evening message the the the supernatural word inside of a body producing the exploits oh it's not a gift it's not a personality it's the word hallelujah brother Brandon would say continue on that the evening message must sow evening seed not morning seed evening seed is that right midday scene the seeds back there was the nomination it died it perished but evening time message was show evening timeline and will show evening time results the evening message and he says Jesus time midday message showed midday results the beginning message uh uh showed beginning results made creation he he made his son in his own image the in the midday the evening time he makes a bride forward see by what his word how did he form the Earth he spoke it into existence by the word and so how is this coming to B how was it coming to pass by the word hallelujah brother Brandon would say in another place after 2,000 years the critics that try to put him to death down there is trying to do the same thing today but the same signs the same Supernatural sign still shows amongst Supernatural people it still shows amongst Supernatural people come on now if they can't see this message is because they're not called to it if they can't see this word inside of the Bride they're not called to it if they're putting the Greater Works upon the prophet they're not Supernatural enough to see it but I'm called by a supernatural Grace to have the Greater Works not in Malachi 4 but inside of the Bride she's producing the Greater Works a teenager is producing the Greater Works a young boy young girl is producing the supernatural side and he continues on to say which is the Seed of Abraham amen I feel good amen Supernatural you don't believe in Supernatural how can you believe in God Supernatural born by a supernatural birth by a supernatural power he says talk about super oh and in that message is super sign and it's a powerful message he talks about everything is super he says you don't you no longer have the little the little grocery stores but you got the supermarket he says we don't got the little highways but we got a super highway of five Lanes going each Direction he says the America built a super ship and says God itself can't even sink it and God put the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean he says Rel living in the time of super everything's super Russia thinks they're super but at the same time there's a supernatural people that don't think they're super they know they're super not what they can do but a supernatural belief in a supernatural word is performing the life of Jesus Christ oh man we can't help it we're just called to it you see brother Brandon would say and when Daniel saw a vision of that he said though they that and though they do wicked and shall do wicked in the last days but they that know their God shall do exploits in the last days speaking of this time know what know what exploits is exploits of faith will perform signs and wonders so they that do wickedly can't help but do wicked but the people that has called to this can't help but do it you see and I like how the Bible puts it in my opening scripture the Bible says Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled in other words he's seen some things that he can make changes on and then he purposed in his heart but then the Bible would say he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not be defiled and that distruct me when I read that he didn't just keep it in his heart but then he started to make changes he put it into action and says the word I'm putting in my heart I'm purposing my heart but I know the word is going to contradict some actions it's going to contradict some things I'm eating here and he requested he put it into action and says the way I'm living I'm not doing anymore and I think my that should be our desire I'm not just going to put the message in my heart it belongs there but I'm going to put it on the outside as well I'm going to request if I need to go to friends and say I'm not talking like that anymore I'm going to make things right if I need to delete music I'm going to delete music if I need to delete pictures off my phone I'm going to delete those pictures it's not just staying in my heart but I'm going to request I'm put it in putting it into action that is the exploits in other words I'm not just keeping it here but I'm putting it here hallelujah he took the convictions on the inside that understanding brought then brought it on the outside and what I love about that is he started a bargain he says okay let our countenance let our countenance determine what we're doing right if we're doing it right or if they're doing it right and I think man that's the confidence of the believer okay let let's have a showdown you do what you're doing we'll do what we're doing and let our countenance let our exploits let the actions of Faith determine if this message is right or if your Creed is right oh I think if there's ever a group on the earth that is has a countenance that is liken un to the word it is the message of the hour if there's a young people that has the countenance of Jesus Christ here is this message oh man the Bible would tell us in Proverbs 15-13 a marry heart maketh a cheerful countenance so it all starts with the heart but you got to let the heart Express itself on the outside you see I read this last time brother Brandon would say now he has cried out in this last agage you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing it hacking into into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you don't want you were not interested in living it he is saying we don't want to I don't want to argue and to our preachers have gotten a and got that in their mind that the only reason they study is to argue and that's not the case brother brandom is saying you have the word you have more Bibles you have more the yeah you have everything right here but you're not interested in the exploits you're not interested in the word you see convictions can have strong arguments but I don't want to have strong arguments I want to have strong exploits hope this is making sense tonight I want to have what's on the inside coming on the outside you see and the Bible would tell us in John 15 and 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruits and that your fruit should remain that's whatsoever you should ask of my father in my name he may give it to you and I just love that he did he didn't just choose us but he ordained us and the word ordained means to appoint the set so he didn't just he didn't just choose us to put us on a Pew but he chose us and ordained us appointed us unto exploits appointed us under good works that those Works should remain and and just bear with me a few seconds here he links the good fruit and the third P together and you see many people get in their mind that exploits is the supernatural exploits is the spoken word and that comes with it but he is saying here don't be worried about speaking the word be worried about living the word he says and orain you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask that's the third pole that's the spoken word but exploits ain't always the spoken word exploits is a young person living the word that's exploits exploits is the word coming inside of a m and prod producing the life of Jesus Christ to her children exploits is the Life coming in a daddy and going to work and producing fruit and the fruit is remaining not here today and gone tomorrow that's not what the Bible is saying but he called you and appointed you that your good works should remain oh man so the life of this word is bringing ain't just for today but it's for tomorrow and the same life that is there tomorrow is going going to be with us all the way to the coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah but you see many people think since they since they've never spoken tongues they've never seen a vision they've never prophesied that they're not producing exploits but exploits is the Life coming inside of the believer you see in the Bible would tell us in Ephesians 2 and8 by grace are you saved through faith not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man lest any man should both for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works for God hath before ordained or appointed that we should walk in them and so he's telling us here we're not saved by works but once we are saved we become his workmanship and we are we are appointed unto good works that he has for ordain for us to walk in and you know that just struck me that we're walking in them it it's flesh taking on the life of God and walking in it not professing it not confessing it but we're walking in them you see the Bible would tell us in First Peter uh 2 and9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you and the like how scoffield puts it he describes the word Praises as virtues or excellencies and as I read that you know that just and and I love definitions you know that just really stood out to me you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the virtues of him who hath called you oh man if you ever get that Revelation that we're not just predestinated to be predestinated but we're predestinated to have the attributes of God on manif on display the same attributes that was in the of God is the same virtues that is inside of the Bride hallelujah oh man so since we are called to show forth it we are showing forth the virtues you see brother Brandon going say the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is liken to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest oh man so that takes the pressure off of me and puts it upon the word that I'm not trying to manifest it I'm just reflecting what is what is inside of this word you remember brother brandom talks about the do and he says you wake up early in the morning and there's Dew on the ground and he says it's reflecting and sparkling and it's really pretty but it's not the Dee it's just reflecting the beauty of the sun it's reflecting another power and oh man we are his virtues we're his attributes we're his life and it's not because of us we're just reflecting the life of the word hallelujah and he continues on to say there was no fault in her she has she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord all of his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God oh man that's just powerful in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God the true church the the the true bride her righteousness is his righteousness oh man and you see remember what what is the second the second fold of the three-fold purpose it was God in Christ and then God inside of the believer and and having the preeminence and you see the Bible would tell us in second Peter 1:16 for we we have not followed cting the device fables but when we when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty and so he says we're not just following device fables we're not just following something in our imagination that ain't true but we're I Witnesses of his majesty and can anybody say that tonight we're not just following a prophet but we're eyewitnesses of the authority that lays inside of this word hallelujah and we're just we're just experiencing and reflecting the power of this message we're seeing evening time results and you see the Bible would tell us in Revelation 17- 14 hope this is okay tonight Revelation 17-4 and they shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called chosen and faithful oh man so he's saying the Lamb's going to overcome but he's not the only one that's overcoming but he has a called elect he has a Chosen Few that is faithful oh man that means I'm faithful in my calling if he seen me faithful then I'm going to remain faithful now if I overcome then I'm overcoming now Hallelujah I'm overcoming now it don't matter how hot the world is getting how you it amazes me there when Daniel whenever the three Hebrew boys is about to be thrown into to the fiery furnace number one and we've heard that as the children growing up number one the furnace was seven times harder but I never caught this I guess but the Bible would say in Daniel 3 and 20 and he commanded the most mighty man that was in his army he didn't just skip the weaklings but he got the most Mighty Man into the army the most Mighty Warriors and say hey bind them bind them and throw them into the furnace and I think man the devil didn't just send the scraps he didn't just send the worst but he said he got this most Mighty Man and says go and bind them but oh the devil didn't realize Nebuchadnezzar didn't realize you might bind them now but there's an understanding that has been poured out though if we don't bow God's going to save us anyways and with that understanding come the Fourth Man in the fire and loose their bounds and oh man the devil may try to crank up the heat he may send his Gra he may send pornography he may send gossip but there's an understanding inside of this bride that I'm not bowing my knee to any image I'm not bowing to any addiction but there's an authority that comes with understanding oh the lid of hell has been released in this age and brother Brandon would say all of hell has been loosed in this generation but at the same time all of Heaven has been poured out to the believer oh it ain't hopeless that there's still exploits in the midst of a chaotic time there were still exploits and you know and as you look around and sometimes it gets it gets discouraging because they're you you see a lot of Hypocrites you see a lot of naysayers you see a lot of lot of blasphemers turning away from the message and you wonder Lord is there really is there really somebody rising to the occasion and you know and and and I read this the other day in Romans 11:3 and the Bible would say Lord this is Elijah Lord they killed thy prophets Dig Down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life oh man have you ever felt that way that Lord Oh all the Mighty Men of the devil is after me I feel I got I got a mind battle after mind battle after mind battle Am I by myself I don't feel like I have anybody to talk to I don't feel like I have anybody to confide in and then the Lord would say but what sayith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Bell in other words Elijah you're not by yourself there is still some men there is still a generation there's still masam there's still daddies there's still young people that is not bowing their knee to pornography not bowing their knee to the pleasures of the world I have an elected people that is standing with exploits they know their God in the midst of criticism in the midst of Mind battles in the midst of it all they're still not bowing their knee oh man and the Bible would say in the next verse Romans 11:5 even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace oh so not then but at this present time and I'm glad he put that this present time because that that can be there back back on Paul's day that can be in Luther's day or that can be today anytime you read that and it says this present time time that lets you know that God still has a Remnant today he still has an elected that is not bowing their knee oh but and you notice you know hey God was sayy I still got a body I still got a people they might not be in the Limelight but they're still there Elijah you're not the only one that's fighting persecution they're fighting it but they're still standing and you see that's a paradox that's a paradox to me is somebody that is standing against the pressure you know cuz cuz any the world uh denominations can imitate gifts they can imitate speaking in tongues they can imitate prophesying but there's one thing that can't imitate that is standing against the pressure to me that is a paradox and brother Brandon would say that's a paradox to see the word come forth not gifts not prophesying but the word come forth and but the Brandon would say Paradox means something incredible but true that is a paradox something that's almost completely out of Reason couldn't it be so but yet it is that a paradox oh something completely out of Reason couldn't it be so but yet it is and you know whenever we talk of a paradox we we automatically think of Joshua and you know causing the sun to stand still or or we think of Daniel laying with the Lions we think we think of Elisha saying where where's where's the god of Elijah you know those were natural paradoxes but the natural Seed of Abraham the Bible would tell tell us in Genesis 22 and 17 that in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy and so the natural seed would possess many natural Gates and brother Brandon would tell us Moses came against his gate the Red Sea and he possessed it he says that the the three Hebrew children went up against the Gate of fire and they possessed it it was a natural seed coming up against Natural Gates and brother Brandon would say this Daniel possessed the gates of the enemy's Gates of lions the mtha could not eat them and Samson one time a bunch of people had fenced him in the city and when he did he pulled those great big Gates out of the Rocks put them upon the shoulders and walked out up top of the hill why was he he was still in the Covenant his locks were still hanging there that was a promise that was laying there he'll possess the gates of his enemy and we see that a natural people under a covenant was producing exploits against the natural people against the Philistines against the fire against the Lions but they never come against the supernatural there were never overcoming things and here brother the Brandon would say this we've had all of these things in the path of Abraham's Royal seed has come up that same path that Abraham come up but just before destroying of the world the super sign must appear again and an eternal Everlasting Resurrection sign that proves that the Royal seed could not be like could not be killed like Daniel and the rest of the prophets was the grave could not hold him the others conquered Gates of the enemy such as fire lion sword and so forth they conquered that but this Royal seed conquered death hell and the grave nothing could hold him you see he said the natural seed conquered fire they conquered they coner a natural enemy but the Bible would tell us in Ephesians we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness so he's letting us know that we're not going to come against the natural people so how are we going to overcome and brother Brandon was telling us here that while he's an everlasting super sign what is a super sign the resurrection of Jesus Christ after being dead for 2,000 years stands in the midst of us the same as he did then manifesting himself in the church in human flesh and so just like Jesus overcome the super in the Supernatural realm you know brother the brandom says they overcome fire they overcome lies they overcome the Red Sea but Jesus overcome death Hell In The Grave he wasn't just overcoming the natural things he was overcoming the supernatural things and then he says he's doing it today inside of the church human flesh oh so we're not fighting the Philistines we're not fighting for for our Mountain but we're fighting in a supernatural realm but just like the natural seed they perform natural exploits there's a supernatural seed performing Supernatural exploits oh you might not look like you're doing much but if you're overcoming you're performing the Supernatural and oh man that's what's something that's been on my heart lately is you may never speak in tongues you may never you may never prophesy you may never lay hands on the sick and they recover you may never have a vision but that doesn't mean you're left out that doesn't mean you're not performing exploits some of you may never do that I've never spoken tongues I've never I've never had a vision I've never had a a word of Prophecy that doesn't mean I'm left out but it's the supernatural inside of a super seed performing the exploits when you wake up in the morning with the sound of mind that is exploits oh Hallelujah as a mama when you're teaching your children about the things of God that is exploits you're not left out God has called you in this generation Hallelujah to perform the exploits and you see and when we look about how the Royal se but brother brand would say Jesus he come and he conquered the spiritual he conquered death hell and the grave and we look at Philippians 4:7 and the peace of God which path passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus and I think man you want to talk about a paradox it's somebody with a sound of Mind in this generation come on we're living in the day of insanity people are losing their minds people mental illness is peing but at the same time it's completely out of reason for somebody to have a sane mind but it was promised that I'm not only going to keep your hearts when I'm going to keep your minds and oh man I don't think we have to lose our minds come on come on now sometimes masam wake up and they feel like they're losing their mind you don't got to lose your mind sometimes daddy under the pressure FL through he's going to lose his mind but he promised to not just keep your heart not just keep your body but we're looking into the supernatural I know the Mind battles but when you're keeping your mind it's exploits hallelujah we're living in the day of insanity the Bible would tell us in Isaiah 32:18 and my people shall dwell in a Peaceable habitation and Ur dwellings and in quiet resting places my people shall dwell in a Peaceable habitation a Peaceable in the midst of chaos there's a habitation that I'm dwelling again and David would say be th my habitation where I continually Resort not occasionally not often but be my habitation where I continually Resort you see if you don't know what what what what what's going to be the outcome you can never rest you know I remember as a kid as a little as a little child I'm sure all little kids go through it you think there's a boogie man in your closet you know you think there's a monster under the bed you and you you think and and I always had vivid dreams and I remember waking up thinking there there's somebody in the room and I could never rest I was never in a Peaceable habitation because my my mind was never out of rest but the Bible is saying my people shall dwell in a Peaceable habitation your mind can be at rest you can go to sleep sleep knowing that you're going to wake up tomorrow and God's going to keep you you can wake up tomorrow knowing that God's going to keep your children it's a Peaceable habitation it might not look like natural exploits but it's supernatural exploits taking place hope this is making sense tonight oh my the Bible would say in Isaiah 26 and3 thou will keep him in perfect peace who's a mind to stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee his mind shall be in perfect that would keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon thee the Bible would say we have our anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which ENT entereth into that within the Veil The Bible would say in 1 Thessalonians 1 and5 for a gospel came not into you in word only but also in power in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance you know I'd never seen that much Assurance before I guess always heard in power and the Holy Ghost but he says in much Assurance that's why we can have a sound of mind we can be in a Peaceable habitation because understanding has brought us a a very much Assurance the Bible would tell us the AP in Acts 20 and 24 but none of these things move me none of these things no matter what I'm going through I'm in a Peaceable habitation somebody is standing strong not being tossed around back and forth not buckling under the pressure but they're dwelling in a Peaceable habitation you see brother Brandon would say then will it be Paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he is trying his best best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God a perfect Paradox is the supernatural in the Supernatural realm oh this making sense tonight and it's like I I don't know why this has been something I that's been dealing been dealing on my heart that we don't got to look for the natural exploits but there's Supernatural things that we don't realize when we wake up and our children have the right mind that's exploits you know and I always have that fear that that my children would you know that there would be something wrong with them but here I got two children that have their right mind that's exploits we Overlook the little things looking for the big things we Overlook what God's doing here looking for something major and we fail to see that in the Supernatural there's exploits taking place there's achievements of faith that is taking place you see uh Mama keeping her home a sanctuary for God to dwell so her children have a safe haven Haven that's an exploits and you know the and the Bible would say in judges 6:12 and the angel of the Lord appeared he talking about Gideon appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee the Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with this why then is all this befallen us where be all of his miracles which our fathers told of saying did not the Lord bring us out of Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the asset and I'm the least of my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee Thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man and sometimes we all feel like that I'm the least I'm not the greatest I've got nothing to offer I've got nothing to show and you know and and and what I thought was amazing is the and the angel of the Lord told Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor and then Gideon turns around and says but God I'm po I'm poor and you know one definition of Valor Is wealth and that just struck me that God was seeing him a certain way but Gideon was looking at himself in a completely different way come on now the way and because he was looking at himself different than the way God was looking at him he couldn't perform exploits but the angel of the Lord was saying you're a mighty man of Valor quit looking at yourself this way I see you in a completely different way oh man young people quit looking at yourself in a in a different way than what God looks at you he's looking natur just saying I've chosen you for a reason M I've chosen you for a reason daddies I've chosen you for a reason I know you feel tired I know you feel like you're you're you're the least in the Kingdom but I've chosen you you're you're wealthy God sees you in a completely different way all Gideon seen was failures all Gideon seen was insecurities all Gideon seen was inabilities but what God seen was exploits what God seen was the supernatural oh when little church all you may be looking at is insecurity ities all you may see his complexes all you may see his inabilities but God is saying I see something different I'm not looking at what you can do I'm looking what I can do I'm not looking at how great of a husband you are I'm looking how I am through you making you a great husband making you a great Mama making you raise up a children of exploits quit looking at the quit looking at your failures look at what I see where be the god of Miracles where's the exploits and God would say Gideon you're looking at it right there you're the exploits you're the miracle you're the one that's going to perform the Supernatural and you know and and and watching my wife not too embarrassed her but as as we travel it gets stressful and I and I feel for her you know I was talking to brother Harry it's pretty easy for us us husbands you know we pack the car unpack the car we we go to sleep you know she's up all night with the kids she's getting things packed back in the suitcase you know and you know brother brandom calls the mother the fth gospel and just watching her as she's with as she's with uh with Ethan and and training him up and with Briel and you know it's to be honest as I heard the girl sing that song back there that has really done something to my heart I want to live for Jesus that's the Fifth Gospel in action that's exploits you might not have anything that you can point to and say I'm doing the supernatural but you're looking to the supernatural realm and say Souls that are worth 10,000 worlds those are exploits you may get weary you may get tired you may feel like like you're not you're not wealthy in the kingdom of God but God has chose you for such a time as this there's exploits that are being risen up oh you may feel left out you may feel like like the husband has the calling but God has called you but the Brandon would say it's Matthew Mark Luke John mothers it's mothers why does the gospels do the gospels explain the Life of Christ and how come we put mothers there because it's mothers that explain the Life of Christ to the children hope this is okay tonight th this was really dealing with my heart and brother brand I'm going talk about John he says as John was up on the boat with the disciples and he says he would start to testify and say I I know this is the Messiah I know this is Jesus and he would REM he would go into go into his memory and say I remember as a child mama would put me on her knee and tell me about Elijah she would tell me about about Jos and the walls coming down and brother brandham says John would make the connection between Jehovah and Jesus how come the Fifth Gospel and I think oh Lord I want my children to make the connection between Jesus and the Bible and Jesus in this message they're one and the same but what's making the connection The Fifth Gospel it's mothers that are with them every day that is with them that that's helping their scrape knees or helping their runny noses but at the same time there's you might not see something taking place naturally but look in the Supernatural realm and you'll see that there's a connection taking place there's a connection every time you pray with them over their food there's a connection that has taken place and brother Brandon was saying Little John was convinced that the Bible stories that mother told him about Jehovah that same Jehovah was manifested in a man called the Lord Jesus cuz no one else could have done it he was the creator he was convinced because of a mother you think you think of uh uh it was blind bmus brother brandom talks about blind bmus so it was blind bmus the mother that his mother would put her on his on her lap and brother Brandon would say he would she would wipe the tears off his face and push back his hair and start to tell him about Jehovah start to tell him about uh about how Moses split the Red Sea and the brother brandom dramatizes it he he says he she tells the story about Joshua and Jericho's walls follow falling down and now here's blind barus he's sitting upon the the ruins of that wall he's sitting there brother the brandom says he starts to think about the stories that Mama would tell him and I I could just imagine as he's sitting there he can't see he's just thinking of how Mama talked about Jehovah Mama talked about Joshua causing knocking the walls down Moses split in the Red Sea but he couldn't see he wanted to see this Jehovah he wanted to see this God and all of a sudden he heard a commotion he heard commotion and and somebody would come and tell him hey hey there Jesus is walking by and a connection would connect something would connect what was it it was the reality of Jehovah and the and and Jehovah the mama would tell him about come together and coming by his way was his eyesight did you ever think about that coming by his way his eyesight his Paradox his exploit come about because of a mama did you ever think about that mama ain't Less in the kingdom of God hope this is okay tonight mama ain't a door M mama is making the connection blind barus got his eyesight because of mama was the Fifth Gospel talking about Jehovah and there he is sitting there then Here Comes his isai walking by and oh man I could just imagine oh that's the one that's the god that split the Red Sea that's the god that brought down Jericho's walls that's the god that defeated of Goliath that's the God right there that's the connection mama's been telling me about you see brother Brandon would would say this on this spot a certain beggar by the name of blind bmus sitting at the gate he was thinking of those things and he sat there first thing he begin to think when I was a little boy I had eyesight and I remember when I used to play on the Hills Yonder and pick pretty flowers in Juda I can remember my darling mother how she would take me in her arms and stroke his little black hair from from his blue eyes and say barus you're the sweetest little boy and how she used to Rock Me In Her Arms and tell me Bible stories and he says you know America needs more mothers like that not so much about David Crockett and Elvis Presley Arthur Godfrey what about Christ the Bible there's more kids in the city that could tell you about Elvis than there is that can tell you about Jesus Christ and then you wonder why we got juvenile delinquency stabbing people to death on the streets and we become a neur age because we left God out if that's happening in the world what about here today there's the opposite effect there's some young children that is raising up with exploits raising up and becoming a paradox let our musicians come tonight if the world has their example God has his example there's going to be a voice on both sides there's going to be exploits on both sides let us be a Godly example Amen brother Brandon preaches a message and you know and and and teaching on Moses and it's a kid message and man if parents have I I listen to it and to be honest it it it I don't know I remember before I had children I'm sure parents can can testify I I felt bad having kids just because we're living in a crazy world they they didn't choose to be here and that really really was was on my mind that man where there's h sexuals lesbians there's there's drugs there it's it's a crazy age and here these little innocent children are being born into a crazy a crazy time and brother Brandon preached the message teaching on Moses and it's a kid message but it encouraged me as a parent if y'all haven't listened to it before really encouraged me brother brandom he he talks about Moses and he says the angel of God come to amram which is Moses's dad and he says because you've been faithful in your house and you've been a praying man you're going to be a part of my program and he says out of your seed is going to come the deliver her because you've been faithful and as Amron would go to jocked and start to tell her what the angel told her and brother Brandon and he says this is back in 50 56 and he said and joab would say no we can't have a child now they're killing babies we can't have a child this this ain't the right time for it and that really just struck me this ain't the time but then he would say but the Lord told me he would keep the baby and that struck me as a parent God has given us a promise we got a crazy world out there but God promised to keep our children God promised to keep our babies no matter what they go through if we just apply the token if mothers be their Fifth Gospel if fathers be an amran and keep their house in prayer and again and create an environment for God to flow through and brother Brandon would say and he would call all the uh uh he he would call a council meeting Pharaoh would and he said there' be some some old witch ladies with long noses would come up and say I know what to do we kill the babies brother brandom says it's the same today they're trying to kill our children I think man it's it's the lesbians the spirits that women are putting out there that are killing our babies killing our killing teenagers brother Brandon would say but you know if God gave us this baby God will take care of the baby God promised and God would take care of it and brother Brandon would say as Pharaoh was destroying homes killing babies and this destruct me brother brandom says here comes one of those old witches knocking on the door so I know you got a baby in there and they said the parents would say no we don't got a baby to give and that distract me the world of Hollywood with the spirits are coming through each hope coming through lives knocking on the doors and as it comes to our house we can say we got one but we don't got one to give we don't got any to give and brother brandham says we ain't got no baby to give you and he says they didn't oh man then then he says okay we'll come back later and brother brandham says there was a little secret place that amrad had prepared for the baby then here they come back kicking the door in but he says he put the baby in the secret place and here they come searching through the hole when never could find it because the secret place I think oh my there's a Peaceable habitation that we can dwell in a secret place not just for us but for our children whenever the world comes about knocking on the door influences are trying to come in homosexual Spirits are trying to break down the door break break down the bars there's a Peaceable habitation there's a secret place that they can't find him oh brother BR says they search through the home saying we know you got a baby in here we know you got one in here but brother brandom says it was a secret place they looked everywhere and couldn't find it oh man brother Brandon would say this she goes upstairs and prays Jehova you got ears Jehovah you got eyes you can hear you can answer prayer you gave us this baby you gave us your promise and you will keep your promise you'll keep that baby I'm confident and oh man and and like I said this has been just speaking to my heart that sometimes we can't point to Natural exploits but in the Supernatural children are exploits our marriages are exploits a sound of mind is exploits the brother Brandon would say and daddy would go inside the workshop and he says he's singing a song I think he was singing Old Time religion and if you listen to it he's sitting on the pull pit he he's knocking he's singing and you can hear the children laughing in the background but then you also hear some parents and you can just tell it's it's really striking home you hear them it's Amen and you can you can hear a little cry ever so often and brother brandom says he's building a little ship it hasn't got no Rudder hasn't got no sail hasn't got no cannons on it yet it's going to pack the most precious cargo that was ever packed by a ship then brother B he's reading he's preaching off of the the this scripture in Luke 9:24 for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it but who who whoever shall lose his life for my sake shall save it and and brother brandom says AMR is speaking to jocked it says but we got to get rid of it we got to give it back we got to give it back if we keep it we're going to lose it and brother brandom's just typing that out to the children if you keep your soul you're going to lose it but if you give it back to the one who gave it to you you're going to keep it but that just struck me as a parent that we can give our children back to God we're not keeping them and saying okay we're going to do what our want but since we're in a Peaceable habitation since we've come in contact with our God we gave our children back to our back to the Lord and not not and do what what Daniel did not just say that in our heart and do what we want bring Spirits in bring influences in but Daniel says since I'm purposing in my heart I'm going to make changes I'm going to request to make changes and this is what jocked and amran was doing we're not just saying we're giving it back to back to God in the heart but we're giving it to God and I than Lord we're giving our children back hope this has been okay tonight in the midst of a chaotic time brother brandham would say and and parents I don't encourage you just go and listen to this it just it really it spoke to my heart and brother brandham would say that as he they put the boat inside of the river he says when something is happening on Earth something is also happening in heaven he says God gets Gabriel and says hey Gabriel come here he says look down there see that's the man you went down and visited and said he was going to have the baby he says look look they're standing they're standing and he says okay I want I can't remember what the number I want like 10,000 angels to go down there go down there and watch over that cargo and one of the angels look to God and says where are you going to go he says I'm at the receiving end of it so I'm going to be at the end to receive it and I thought oh my if we just give it back to God away from the influences away from the pressure of the world there's 10,000 angels brother Brandon would say here would come a crocodile and Angel would say no here would come a whirlpool and the angel says no and there the carg would go through the midst of Le oosa our children are being raised in the midst of Le oosa and yet there're still exploits oh M you might not comp point and say oh yeah I've done this I've done that I do this but look up the exploits on the front row look up the exploits brother the mar look up the exploits look up look at Sister Sister Mary Sister Amy Sister Laura brother Adam those are exploits brother Mitch you got your children those are exploits sister totha you might not be able to look and say I've done this but look at the exploits sister Stephanie look at your exploit you know but the Tor sister April we might not be able to point at things but we can point in the Supernatural and say since I'm a supernatural seed I'm performing Supernatural exploits let's bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord this is what's been on my heart lately father Lord as you're my witness you've been dealing on with me father I want to be a good par Lord as I told my wife the other day are we good enough parents for our children lord they're so innocent they don't know anything Lord the only thing they know is what we teach them and Lord as a parent I ask that you would help us to be an amram a joabe Lord that ain't going to keep it it's going to give their children back to you father Lord it was Hannah that says I'm giving her back to you Samson's mother gave him back to you Lord and father as parents help us to stand to the occasion and give it back to you father Lord if there's somebody here that's weary maybe they're tired if there's a Fifth Gospel here that's tired and weary Lord remind them tonight that there's exploits that they can look at father there's a paradox living in a day where children don't know if they're girls or boys It seems impossible but yet it's true for there's there's children that's in a Peaceable habitation as we leave this place father may we not just purpose in our heart but may we request father may we leave this place Lord and put it into action we ask these things in your precious name Amen brother Brandon would say this the father's walking in the water starts to push the little boat out I can hear him say Gabriel yes Lord call 10,000 angels to the scene give them marching orders right away call the host of Heaven sell them up down along the banisters of heaven and put them down in the Nile I command no crocodile will touch that cargo nothing will touch it not even a chunk of wood will come near it Hallelujah Gabriel said it shall be done sound the trumpet 10 Angels comeing arm father where you going to be Lord I'll be at the other end he's always on the receiving in all way down at the other end I got a
