Mercy built [singing] a bridge. You say we can cross, but we [singing and music] must cross a Calvary way that [music] leads from night into [singing] our brightest day.

Oh, mercy, [singing and music] rewrote my life. And [singing] I should have fallen. My [music] soul [singing] cast down but [music] mercy rewrote [singing] my life. Amen. God bless you now. There I [singing and music] go falling down again trying to run a race I [music] can't win sometimes I just [singing] want to bow out [music] to throw in the towel now my mistakes try twisting the truth [singing and music] but I I know somebody who loves to use all the [music and singing] little broken pieces. You're bringing strength to my weakness. Oh, [music] you're telling [singing] my soul. [music] It's not too late.

As we get ready for the man of God here tonight, I'd like to go to prayer. Pastor Brother Michael, it is his birthday today. So, happy birthday to brother Michael. Amen. [applause] I'd like to go to prayer. We got a request here. Says, "Please remember Sister Lona in prayer. She had to have a wisdom teeth removed today and [music] is resting at home." So, let's remember Sister Lona here tonight. And if anyone else has a need upon their heart, just make it known by the lifting of your hand. God bless you. down. Let's just bow our hearts here this evening. Heavenly Father, we sure do [music] appreciate you, Lord. Lord, we just never wanted to be too busy to let you know that we love you, God. We're just [music] thankful for your mercy, your grace, Lord, for your peace, for providing all our needs, Lord, meeting our needs [music] here this evening, Lord. A place that we'd be able to take all the unknowns and the impossibles. We can put them in your hands, Lord, and you can [music] come and you can make something out of nothing. Lord, we love you. Father, I would just [music] ask that you would just see these requests, Lord, or Sister Lona, who had her wisdom teeth pulled. [music] Lord, I would just pray that you would just give her a speedy recovery here this evening. God, be with all those that have unspoken requests [music] and needs, Lord. Father, I would just pray that you would be with the man of God as he's [music] making his way, putting his thoughts together. Lord, I would just ask that you would just give him the words to speak and that you would just answer the questions, [music] Lord, and be in our hearts and minds. We just thank you. Be careful to give you the praise. Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. As the man of God comes, can we sing this? When I [music] look into [singing] your holyness, when I gaze into your loveliness, when all things that surround become shadows in the light of you. Yes, Lord. When I find the joy of [singing] reaching your heart, when my [singing] will becomes enthralled in your love, when all things [singing] that surround become shadows in the light of you. I worship you. Oh, I worship [music] you. [music] I worship you. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; worship you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, yes. [music] I [singing] worship you. Oh, I [singing] [music] worship you. You Oh, for reason I live. [music] It's to &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing that chorus [music] again. I worship you. Oh, I worship you. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. Yes, I do. [music] I worship you. Oh [singing] no. Oh the [music] reason &gt;&gt; is to worship. Oh yes.

I love [singing] you Jesus. &gt;&gt; The [music] reason I live is to worship you. The reason. Oh, the reason [singing] I live is to worship you. Amen. Amen. Amen. I worship you. you know, every chance we get to come to church and to praise him, to love him, I think I think the we should take advantage of those things. Amen. The psalmist says the the trees, they they wave their branches to the Lord and praise to him. He says, "The [music] hills they skip and and they praise the Lord." Well, if nature does that, how much more should it be for you and me? &gt;&gt; As sons of God, redeemed of the Lord, when we come [music] to church, have our hands up in the air, tears running down our face. [music] Sometimes we're clapping and rejoicing, but it's because he has made us glad. He has redeemed us. And I so [music] love him here tonight. I'm so thankful for him. Good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. [music] Good to see everyone and and uh enjoying this beautiful weather and and uh good sunny [music] week and in the 70s and and uh but we enjoyed it on Sunday too. [music] Amen. We appreciated all the hard work. [applause] I thought I thought everything was wonderful. I um I got on that slingshot and didn't really get to [music] get around uh very much, but uh it looked like everyone was having a good time. I know I was having a good time aggravating the youngans and uh uh watching people shoot targets or shoot themselves. Amen. And uh we had a wonderful time. And so we say God [music] bless everyone that that that made it happen. And and I tell you uh Tuesday was amazing with with the amount [music] of folks coming out and helping. And I say God bless you and and thank you so much. Um, I think we got it done [music] in a for the most part of it record time of uh 4 hours. [music] Uh, got and uh the boys and I were still taking things back different people until later on in the afternoon, but uh the the main part was was totally [music] done and uh so I say God richly bless every one of you. Hey, listen. And [music] I just [clears throat] I'm just here to tell you those the ladies of our church totally took down that tent. &gt;&gt; THEY [applause] [applause] they took down that tent. They they uh they done it all. And uh uh Caleb and [music] I took the main poll out, but uh I mean they were they were awesome. And so uh uh I say God bless you. You you you guys have you you you men. It's no wonder your families are so [music] blessed. Uh those ladies just jumped in and helped wherever they could and and [music] they could. They done a [laughter] good job. And so we say God bless them. just appreciate everyone [music] uh all of the work, young and old, man and woman. And um I think [music] one of these days we'll see. I got one uh Ronnie uh Justice um pulled me aside and and u and he he said, "Come here. I got to talk to you." and and um so he pulled me around the corner [music] and he said, "Listen, you are making a difference and [music] you are making a difference in the world." And I said, "Well, thank you." And [music] he said, "I'm serious. I'm serious. The you guys are" And he said, "I just had somebody I don't know who it was." does. He said, "I had [music] a man tell me, he said, Wendell Martin, that group over [music] there changed my life." Now, I don't know who the man is, and we might not ever know until the coming of the Lord, but what if there are people that we have [music] changed that maybe sometimes we get weary or we, you know, like Sunday, we put all that work out and didn't get very many [music] from the community cuz it was so cold. But what if we made an impact on someone's lives that did come? What if and I say we never want to tire in in in welloing. We'll always work for the Lord. Work while we've got strength. There'll come a time where we'll have to pass the torch to to somebody else and we won't be able to be out there doing the work. But I'm here to tell you, Sister Carol is saying, "Amen. and it'll be a long time. Amen. And I kept telling her, "You're you're you're in your mid70s. [music] You're going to have to She was grabbing that she she was grabbing that tent [music] and and stakes." And [laughter] [applause] so we say, "God, God bless all of you. I'd like uh for us to turn to Genesis [music] 21 and 1 or and um and um I want to say it's it's really been good. Uh, I've enjoyed, we've all enjoyed having Brother Theo here in the church with us and [applause] and he he's worked his way from the back of the church to the front of the church and he's dressing like a brother Brandham says, "When you come to church, wear the best you got." and uh and he comes just dressed up and coming to church and and eager to learn the Lord, learn the ways of the Lord. And that kind of an attitude the Lord will bless Brother Theo. And um that's exactly the way I done it when I was a young man. Uh wasn't going to set in the back. I was going to set up front. I was going to learn. I was going to give my all to the Lord. and and um I believe that every one of us uh can can look back at those times in our lives when we made up our mind. I'm going 100%. And I'm glad to see brother brother Theo doing that. And and um Amen. I I I personally think there should never be any kind of room up in the front that the people should want up where the fire is at. Amen. And we know that the prophet of God says the angel of the Lord is at the pull pit. He's with the speaker of the word. And so to see that with you young men and young ladies makes my heart very proud. Now let's look here in Genesis 21. And we're going to look here at the sixth verse. Not the first, the sixth. Sarah said, "God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me." And she said, "Who would have said unto Abram, Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age." And I my my thought tonight is just from the shadows to the positive. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we just want to thank you today for your goodness. As we've heard the songs and we've sung the songs, as I sit there in my office here tonight, Lord, I I could feel the vibrancy of your spirit. The congregation was wanting to be here, Lord. And Father, I as I sat back there, I I asked you to minister to their hearts in a real special way today. Lord, I pray that your anointing would be here this evening. That you would, Lord, just use my lips, my thoughts, Lord. Lord, you just may it be you and you alone. Now, we look to you, Father, in Jesus' name. Can the church say amen? And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here tonight. Tonight, as we're living in the brink of the fulfillment of the Bible prophecy, things that we have that the church has looked for for 2,000 years. And we could even go all the way back to the fall and the promise that God gave back then that there would there would be a people, the woman's seed that would produce the word. Amen. and we would go back to Eden and um it were to where the sons of God would be at one with God, living with God, acting as God as as the children of promise. And as we are looking to the promise of giving birth to the word, sometimes it seems like it's a it's so far-fetched. It seems like it's so far beyond ourselves. And when we look at this, Amen. I I think it's a good consolation. We can gain great consolation by um talking or or looking at Abraham and Sarah. And I want to say here tonight, I forgot those specials were just wonderful tonight. Brother John [applause and cheering] special and and these girls. God [cheering] bless y'all. Good to see brother John tonight. I I u I he's it looks like he's going to be able to start making uh services a little more regular. And so we're sure glad for that. And um we sure love brother John and Sister April and their children. But as we as we uh look here, we we can see the struggles of Sarah and um and as as she was a type and a shadow. Amen. I I believe that God orchestrated the whole thing. And uh now you boys need to be paying attention up front here. But when we look here at the promises of God, we look at these things. We got to come with that heart of of humility and and we we can find ourselves in the scripture in the Old Testament and and as being the children of Abraham and knowing that the promise was given that thy seed shall possess. Amen. Now we understood that that Abraham went 25 years looking for the natural seed. But we Amen. We understand that the Apostle Paul says really he was just a type of the spiritual seed. And that spiritual seed was Christ. And Christ coming as the as the perfect son of God as the redeemer. Amen. to redeem us, to bring us back to that condition that Christ was in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ came to to redeem us back. And so we understand that the promises that we have today is the promise, amen, of that flesh being made word. And that's what we are all looking at today. We're this flesh being made word. Now as we look there at the condition that Sarah was in uh even when the son of man appeared and we understand that we're we have we have we have lived to the through the term this the church has served the term of the holy ghost but we are now living in the revealing of the son of man. It's the promise that God said would happen that Amen. right just before the coming of the Lord that there would be Amen as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah before the destruction that the son of man would visit Sarah give Sarah ability and she would produce the promised child. We are living in that time right now. So when we see the revealing of the son of man, amen, there is the the words of promise have been spoken to into the womb of our heart and we've been believing and but sometimes even right there where the son of man came, Sarah was in the one of the battles of her life &gt;&gt; when when the son of man was revealing her heart when he was beginning to change when he changed their name. When he when he began to tell him that you're going to have the child, Sarah was laughing. Amen. And when the angel of the Lord talked to her and said, "Why are you laughing?" She said, "Oh, I'm not laughing." Amen. But then he turned right around after she laughed and he said, "Sarah shall have that son. &gt;&gt; I will visit her according to the time of life." So, so we we can see Sarah in this at this day the promise had been had been long time coming. She had now been waiting for 24 years and and the pressure had been overwhelming at times. Now Sarah does not does not really have a great resume Sarah for first of all even as a as a child she was never able to produce a baby. Amen. it and and u Amen. And she she was one that that struggled to believe. She had struggled to believe that God would call her, that God would use her. Amen. And so when it when it but yet in the in the crucial times, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS HOLDING HER faith to the promise. Amen. And and I I I want to say that Amen. here tonight that Jesus we've got our our husband the Lord Jesus Christ has Amen. He is there amen uh uh consolidating or he is there uh uh uh uh making the promise sure to all of us as we as we look at ourselves here tonight because I'm going to tell you there's only one way that you're going to come amen into that promise and that's going to believe God and his word. There's absolutely no way that a rapture can come. There's absolutely no way of you overcoming this flesh. There's absolutely no way of going back to the sons of God unless you believe that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's beyond ourselves. There's nothing we can do to do it. And sometimes we sit in this pews and we listen to the preachers and we think there is nothing here that I I I don't know if I'LL EVER PRODUCE IT. But all we can do is say I believe THE WORD. THAT'S WHAT GOD'S LOOKING FOR. HE'S NOT WANTING ANY OF US TO try to make it happen. You can't make it happen. Can you say amen? She was she was JUST AS MUCH A PART OF THE promise as Abraham. AND YET SHE SAT THERE WITH NO ABILITY to conceive. AND AND SOMETIMES AS WE AS WE SIT HERE, it seems like, oh my, it's just so impossible to conceive. AND AND HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT SEEMS at times WHEN NOT ONE SHRED of evidence on her side AND THE EVIDENCE WAS TOTALLY ON the side of reason. Amen. But you see the with this anxiety with this with this uh uh uh wondering and questioning am I really the bride OR CAN I REALLY WILL I EVER BE ABLE? Yet we understand that she was IN GOD'S MIND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; I think that's just amazing because in ourselves, we all look and we think it's it's got to, you know, sister Jones over here, she's she's perfect. She's she's going to make the rapture. Or you can look at brother so and so. Amen. But looking in the mirror, sometimes we look at ourselves and we Amen. We look at our inability. &gt;&gt; And with THAT COMES THE ANXIETY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PROPHECY IS BEING FULFILLED. &gt;&gt; We can see Russia, we can see China, we can see the US, WE CAN SEE ROME, WE CAN SEE ALL OF THIS HAPPENING and many of times we sit there in a in our sour moods. &gt;&gt; Amen. And just like Sarah, sour moods. Well, amen. I don't know. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. BUT GOD HAS ALREADY SAID, "I do because I'm looking at my book and that's your name and I know who you are." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. And so, Amen. But that day must have been a a strange feeling as the prophet would have would would would put it. Amen. It was it was that that special. THERE WAS SOMETHING in the air. AMEN. BECAUSE THE PROMISE WAS FIXING to be made uh to become reality. History was in the making AND AND AND THE PROPHET SAID ABRAHAM SITTING in his chair just thinking about that son that was coming thinking about the promise. Amen. His body is old and dead and Sarah's just as dead as ever. Amen. But that strange feeling is in the air. Amen. AND AND AND AND THAT WAS THE TIME THAT God appeared to him and said, "I'm going to keep my promise." I I want to I just want to inject this here today. Amen. Satan is always looking to find a way in right when God is wanting to do something special in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think it's good to keep the right kind of attitudes even when the devil's fighting us with everything. I think it's the right it it's it's important that we have that right kind of attitude because we never know when he's going to appear. Can you say amen? SO, SO WE'VE GOT TO BE uh careful at which spirit uh he was entertaining. Now, now that morning uh Sarah was was was wondering how many fanatics is my husband going to entertain? Well, here she was ENTERTAINING A SPIRIT THAT WAS CONTRARY to the word and her husband was entertaining the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to entertain the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. That that's what I want to entertain. Amen. So remember, attitudes will open doors. Now again, SARAH, SO AS WE can see, she was not always that that that woman of great faith. Amen. and she looked at things rationally. In fact, IT HAD BEEN QUITE A JOURNEY. She had a hard time uh accepting that God would choose her. And she had always been barren. And her confession is the Lord had shut up my womb. And amen, IT'S GOT TO COME THROUGH SOMEBODY ELSE. IN FACT, SHE gave Abraham her maid. She gave Abraham Hagar. Amen. And says the promised son will come through her. And yet when ISHMAEL WAS BORN, SARAH GOT UPSET. &gt;&gt; SARAH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Abraham just wasn't GOING TO WIN EITHER WAY. AMEN. And so, uh, UH, UH, SHE'S UPSET. SHE SAID, "AMEN." WELL, you know, you love her more than me. And, and Abraham is saying, "Listen, I amen, you know, so her her bonds made was able to TO PRODUCE THE SON." And and the BIBLE SAYS THAT SARAH WAS WAS VERY HARSH TO THE WOMAN SO MUCH that that uh she fled from Sarah. And Abraham was was was was a little bit weary. I I don't KNOW WHAT TO DO. I LOVE ISHMAEL AND I AND I WANT ISHMAEL. I I LET LET THE PROMISE COME THROUGH ISHMAEL, LORD. And and God says, "Amen. Send the bondwoman and her son away." Amen. for the THE PROMISE WILL COME through Sarah and she shall have a son. &gt;&gt; And uh Amen. Oh my, WHAT A WHAT A TIME it was. BUT YOU SEE, I'M GLAD FOR THESE PROTOTYPES BECAUSE IT'S IN THESE PROTOTYPES here that that we and and Amen. You know, we now back then we'd say shadows or types, but these days here they they make the little prototypes or the 3D things to Amen. give you a a a view of what the real thing was going to LOOK LIKE. AND SO GOD WAS WAS WAS PUTTING IT OUT THERE RAW SO THAT EVERY ONE OF US IN THE BRIDE could understand and could see. Amen. JUST AS GOD WAS FAITHFUL WITH SARAH, he's going to be faithful with you. As he was faithful WITH HIM. I THAT JUST MAKES me feel so good. You don't know how often I I I I I'm sitting there in in my in my study of study and and the devil has said, you know, you're one of the most worthless preachers around. Amen. You think, well, now is that is does THAT REALLY HAPPEN? OH, HE'LL TELL ME ALL KINDS OF STUFF. YOU'RE not the ONLY ONE THAT THE DEVIL TELLS THAT TO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT EVEN EVEN THE DEVIL WOULD TELL HIM you don't have a friend in the world. No one loves you. Amen. The only reason they put up with you is because of your gift. Amen. AND AND AND THE DEVIL WOULD WILL HE'LL DO ANYTHING HE CAN. BUT I'm here to tell you there is nothing the devil can do to stop the promise. Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; Nothing Satan CAN DO TO STOP [screaming] THAT PROMISE. &gt;&gt; SO I SAY TODAY, it's time for us to get a RIGHT ATTITUDE. GET AN ATTITUDE THAT SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. DON'T care what it looks like. Don't care what I feel. I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING about me. THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN ME THAT SAYS THAT [screaming] I AM PART OF THAT PROMISE." &gt;&gt; CAN YOU say amen? Amen. It It's wonderful. You see, Sarah was just as much a part of that promise as anything. Now, now, Brother Brandham would would would say Abraham knew that the time of the promise was coming close. It had to be. He was a hundred years old. He was expecting it any time. He watched every minute. And when he run in, told Sarah, "This, I believe, is our day of visitation." And she kind of looked at him with those big eyes and thought, "Well, Abraham, you've said that a long time, but but you know, THERE WILL COME A TIME when it will be so if God has said so." &gt;&gt; And then when THE ANGEL TOOK HIS chair and he leaned back and he said,"Abraham, seeing you have got favor with God and you're an heir of the world, you're going to be the father of many nations and you've believed since you were 75 20 joint 75 years old. your 25 years and other otherwise you've waited for this promised child Basera and now I'm not going to keep this from you. What I'm going to do I'm going to visit you according to the time of life. I'm going to visit you according to the time of life. Now they didn't have the child immediately. Amen. It was going to be months later before the child was going to come. BUT THERE THE VISITATION CAME. the visitation. Amen. Was the words from Elohim saying, "Amen. You're going to produce." There was something about those words that began to change the the bodies of Sarah and Abraham. &gt;&gt; AND I I I SAY THAT THE AUTHOR OF OUR STORY, I believe he's fully aware of our inabilities. And again, I keep going back to it, but I just want to say it again. Amen. He [laughter] I THE AUTHOR OF YOUR story says I knew you before and I know you now. &gt;&gt; I CREATED the story. So I am intimately involved in every part of you because I am the author of the story. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know that God knows your uprisings and your downsittings? God knows all of that. God is not just the Bible says the footsteps of a good man are ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I I I looked there at in there at the uh uh I believe it was the believers there in Samra where where God had said there in Revelations 2:9, "I know thy works and tribulation and poverty, but thou art rich." IN OTHER WORDS, I KNOW I I I'm I'm very much aware of that you're going through the persecution you're going through. Brother Brandon would put it this way. He says, "NOW THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY SAYS, I KNOW THERE HE IS WALKING in the midst of his people. There he is, the chief shepherd of the flock, BUT DOES HE HOLD BACK THE PERSECUTION? DOES HE STEM the tribulation?" NO, HE DOES NOT. HE SIMPLY SAYS, "I KNOW YOUR TRIBULATION. I I am not AT ALL UNMINDFUL OF YOUR SUFFERINGS." WELL, someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT. GOD KNEW WHERE SARAH WAS AT. GOD KNEW THE WHOLE PLAN. GOD KNEW IT ALL AT THE BEGINNING. And we don't realize it until we come down to our age that there had to be a Hagar and there had to be a Sarah and there had to be a Mary. It had to be IN ORDER FOR US TO SEE WHERE WE ARE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WELL, praise the name of the Lord. He says, does he stem the tribulation? No, he does not. He simply says, I know your tribulation. I am not at all unmindful of your sufferings. What a stumbling block that is to so many people like Israel. They wonder if God really loves them. How can God be just and loving if if he stands by and watches his people suffer? That is what they asked in Malachi 1:1. the burden of the Lord uh to to Israel by Malachi. I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet you say, WHEREIN HAST THOU LOVED ME? WAS NOT ESAU JACOB'S BROTHER? SAYAETH THE LORD, YET I LOVE JACOB AND I HATED Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage ways FOR THE DRAGONS OF THE WILDERNESS. SO GOD IS TRYING, GOD WAS SIMPLY SAYING, LISTEN, I AM AWARE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But I've loved Jacob. That didn't stop a lot of the situations he went through, but I was with Jacob. If there's ever anything that can should give you a give you a an anchor is that God knows where you are and there is nothing in your trial. Well, praise the name of the Lord that that can that can take away that love. You know, he he he would also say he says he says they couldn't figure out God's love. They thought love meant no suffering. They thought love meant a baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his LOVE IS ELECTION. THAT NO MATTER what happened, his love WAS PROVEN TRULY BY THE fact that they were chosen under salvation. Because God has chosen you to salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and the belief of truth. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. That is his sovereign. He he that it IT'S BUT IT'S ALL WITH A PURPOSE. HE IF HE DID NOT HAVE A PURPOSE THEN HE WOULD BE THE AUTHOR of frustration and not of peace. His purpose is that after we have suffered a while he would make he uh we would be made perfect and be established strengthened and settled. &gt;&gt; Can I hear a great big amen? &gt;&gt; WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE TRIAL RIGHT NOW, BUT WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE STRONGER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE VALLEY. AMEN. MAYBE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A VALLEY FOR A WHOLE YEAR, TWO YEARS. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A VALLEY a long time. But I'm here to tell you, the great shepherd has been right there by your side. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've not been too strong. I I've fallen here and I've fallen there." I want to tell you, if it had not been for your name on that book and God and if you DIDN'T HAVE JESUS CHRIST INTERCEDING FOR YOU, THERE'D be none of us here. &gt;&gt; BUT THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STILL HERE, AMEN. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR TRIALS. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY FAILURES YOU'VE GOT, HOW MUCH YOU HAVE, YOU HAVE BLOWN IT HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE. AMEN. THE GRACE OF GOD HAS BEEN THERE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] ARE HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. It's not your strength. It's not YOUR STRENGTH. AMEN. JOB SAID THERE IN IN IN IN Job 23 and6 at the last of the verse there, if you'd put that up there, Sister Keys, I can't remember it, but he but but HE SAYS, "BUT HE WOULD PUT STRENGTH in me." He would Pete put strength in me. YOU SEE, GOD [screaming] IS IS IS THERE TO strengthen because he knows that you're the carrier of the promise. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; now and before we move on any further, Isaiah 30:18, it says, "And therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you. Therefore will he be exalted and that he may have mercy upon you. For the Lord is a God of judgment. Blessed are they or all they that wait for him." Okay. &gt;&gt; There's something about the journey that God wants. &gt;&gt; There's something about the journey. Now, I know this a Wednesday night and I don't want to keep you too long, but there's something about the journey that God wants. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID, AMEN. I to the church. Amen. When we look a little on the weak side, we go through the ages and we look that WE'VE SEEN THE HAGARS and her sons and we've seen the denominational systems. AMEN. AND HOW THEY'VE given birth and have no problems and you know they've BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ON CREEDS AND DOGMAS AND AMEN. BUT YET GOD SAID ISHMAEL WILL not be heir with Isaac. Right? &gt;&gt; So when it looks like as far as the two women Ishmael could produce or Hagar could produce, SARAH COULD NOT PRODUCE, THAT GIVES HER A COMPLEX BECAUSE SHE'S LOOKING AT AT AT THE BEAUTIFUL CHILD [screaming] AND HAGAR IS LAUGHING AT SARAH. AND SARAH IS THE ONE WHO'S BEEN GIVEN THE PROMISE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. Does that does that is that really coming close here? Does that really do do you see yourself in the prototype? Do you see yourself in the shadows? Can you say amen? So So a Abraham, even Abraham, the Bible says, started looking at Sarah. Abraham, she she she'll, you know, she'll never catch it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; She is as spiritless as they come. Amen. Sarah just oh all the time accusing me of entertaining strangers and all this kind of stuff when I'm talking to God and he and and and Abraham says oh that Ishmael there in Genesis 17 and 18 Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael might live in thy sight [laughter] you know oh we could get this thing over with if you just change your mind about Sarah and Isaac and let's just have Ishmael but you see that wasn't the promise &gt;&gt; that wasn't the promise GOD WAS VERY EMPHATIC. IF YOU WERE TO GO TO Genesis 17 and 15, they mean it's talking about Sarah uh um or or uh uh hallelujah. I don't know how I've got that, but uh 17- 16, I will bless her and give thee a son also of her. Yay, I will bless her. She shall be a mother of nations, and the kings of the people shall be of her. And the and and and then the next verse is Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is 100 years old and shall Sarah that is 90 that bear a child get bear. You see what I'm saying? You're going down to the n 19th verse and it says and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN WHEN THE APOSTLE PAUL'S TALKING ABOUT it there in the in in uh uh the book of Hebrews 6:13, it says, "FOR WHEN GOD MADE THE PROMISE TO ABRAHAM, BECAUSE HE COULD SWEAR BY NO GREATER, HE SWORE BY HIMSELF, SAYING, surely blessing I will bless thee, AND MULTIPLYING I WILL multiply thee." So after he patiently endured, he obtained THE PROMISE, AND SO WILL THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. You might be fighting your afflictions right now, but the promise is coming. Satan, you might as well en enjoy your time because Amen. The time as I've been given a promise, a promise HAS BEEN GIVEN ME THAT I'm going to give birth to that word. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT WE ARE. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. AND IF WE going to believe that WORD REGARDLESS, THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE. And I want to say here today, that's what we have believed. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We believe the son of man ministry in this day and we are producing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Less of us and more of him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. We preached here a couple weeks ago that despise not the the day of small things. Amen. You see this the days of preparation. Sarah, get your eyes off of you and and it's it's not your abilities. It's not your gifts. Well, glory to God. Amen. God also says there in the book of Genesis the 18th chapter if we went to that next chapter the 18th when when God is having this discourse with Sarah he he he says there in in the Amen uh uh the 13th verse there and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I sure of assurityity bear a child which I'm old AND THEN GOD SAYS IS anything too hard for the Lord &gt;&gt; at the time appointed, I WILL, somebody say, I will. &gt;&gt; I will, &gt;&gt; return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT THAT DOES, IT'S GRACE. IT TAKES IT ALL AWAY FROM YOU. And God's looking for a rest. &gt;&gt; Now, God's expecting that now. God's expecting a faith IN THIS HOUR TO TO BELIEVE. NOW, I KNOW THE MIND BATTLES ARE THERE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO BRING THOSE ATTITUDES IN LINE WITH THE SON OF MAN and believe that that's what's important. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the the the prophet would say, "Amen." That in the midst of it all, through every age, every prophet is being would be, there's going to BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE that's predestinated TO HEAR THAT MESSAGE, AND THEY will follow it. Well, glory to God. Hallelujah. Now you see if she had not been a part of Abraham, she would have totally uh failed. Now I'm want to get us to a certain point here for a moment. The the the prophet would say, "Amen." He said, "My my Lord being old and me old and me having pleasure with him again." And and and brother Brandham intimates or imitates Sarah's silent laugh. And the angel showed Abraham who he was and that he was the word. And he said, "Why did Sarah laugh?" So he called her for it. And she said, "I never." He said, "But you did." What? That's grace right there. God would have slew her right there. But he couldn't. Someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He couldn't see our stupidity. He'd kill every one of us. But he can't. TO KILL SARAH, he had to take Abraham. SARAH WAS PART OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; There was on there was one in union. They were one in union. And to take the church and destroy it, he can't do it because it's part of himself. Christ part of himself. The word being made flesh. &gt;&gt; Oh, amazing how sweet the sound. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. Couldn't do it. You get it? He couldn't kill her. He couldn't take her life because she was part of Abraham. SHE WAS FLESH OF HIS FLESH, BONE OF HIS BONE IN OUR MISTAKES. AMEN. DON'T SAY, "WELL, I MADE A FAILURE." THAT DON'T AMEN. DON'T MAKE THEM. Abraham made failures, TOO. BUT HE COULDN'T TAKE THE CHURCH. He can't KILL THE ELECT. HE CAN'T TAKE YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU are part of himself. YOU ARE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE WORD. YOU'RE THAT PREDESTINATED WORD FOR THE HOUR, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. You are the word for the hour. Then why why why we ask the questions why why does he allow why do I go through he's wanting a faith steadfast in his promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now God made that promise with Abraham. He had told Abraham, I want you to take a heer. I want you to take a a she goat. I want you to take a ram all of three years old. I want you to divide them. Amen. And he and he and he set them out there. Then the pillar of fire come in there and went between the pieces. The prophet of God says that was a type when Jesus God took Jesus. Amen. Separated him, took his body to heaven and left his spirit with us. And when he returns, we've got his spirit. So when he returns, IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME. It's going to be like the two PIECES OF PAPER. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? HALLELUJAH. SO, GOD'S LIKE THIS. AND THE WAY THEY USED TO AMEN. The the the the way the old Chinese uh uh laundry used to go is they would Amen. You would they didn't know how to write when they first come to the United States. And so, uh you would take your your laundry to them. And so what they would do is take a little piece of paper and and they would they would cut it a certain way like this and and maybe like this and and like this and then and and and and and however it it might be. And and um and so you were given a piece [snorts] and they kept a peace. And so when you CAME TO ASK FOR YOUR LAUNDRY, THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TALK to you. They they didn't know the language. But what they could do, they would take your piece and they would go find their piece. And then when it fit together, they knew that you that the product belonged to you. AND WHEN GOD COMES, [screaming] HE'S GOING TO COME, JESUS COMES, HE'S GOING TO LOOK FOR HIS SPIRIT in your body. And they're going to dovetail right together like that. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's the promise. IT'S THE PROMISE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. SO GOD TOOK JESUS AND HE SET BACK HIS SPIRIT. And when the two pieces come back together, well, glory to God, brother Benham, he he paints it beautifully. HE SAYS, "THEN WHAT DID GOD DO AT CALVARY? HE TOOK CHRIST JESUS, HIS SON, PUT HIM ON THE CROSS, TORE HIM INTO HE RENT THE SOUL FROM THAT BODY, TOOK THE BODY UP INTO HEAVEN, AND SENT BACK THE HOLY Spirit to the church." And on that day, the same spirit that WAS UPON JESUS CHRIST HAS TO BE IN THE CHURCH TO DOVETAIL THE TWO BACK TOGETHER. AMEN. IT'S GOT TO BE. HE SAYS, HE SAYS, UH, ON THAT DAY, GOD SWORE BY HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD RAISE THAT CHURCH UP, A GLORIOUS CHURCH. HOW CAN IT FALL? THAT'S GOD'S EVERLASTING, ETERNAL COVENANT. HE SWORE BY HIMSELF. HE'LL KEEP HIS PROMISE. AND then he says, "Oh, I hope you see it." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He puts his spirit. Then how COULD HE KILL YOU? HOW COULD YOU go to hell when you have the very spirit of CHRIST IN YOU? &gt;&gt; HOW COULD YOU MISS THE RAPTURE WHEN THE VERY presence of God is living on the inside of you? &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Winnow, that's the problem." Amen. No one, you know, uh uh uh uh you know, you're you're you're you lean too far to grace and you don't preach. I mean, we got to have more legalism. And Amen. Legalism is GOING TO BREED NOTHING BUT CONDEMNATION. GRACE LEADS TO CONVICTION. THE CONVICTING POWER OF GOD COMES TO US AND SAYS, "LISTEN, YOU ARE SARAH. START BELIEVING MY WORD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. will never rise above a browbeating. We'll never RISE ABOVE IT ALL. AMEN. BUT YOU WILL RISE ABOVE IT WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR name's in that book OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL RISE ABOVE IT WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST ON THE INSIDE OF YOU IS A HOLY SPIRIT. AND IT WILL NOT UH UH UH uh live in an unclean vessel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you love him. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So that day came when Sarah had Amen. When God would appear and change their names, God would appear and God would change the names. Abram, which means fatherless, I'm going to give you a part of my name. I'm going to call you Abraham. I'm going to call you. And brother Brandon would say, see, he took a part of his name and put it in Abraham's or Abram's name, Elohim. And now he gave a part of his name to Abraham, puts them together and says, "Now every time you speak that name, I want you to know that deity is associated with it. &gt;&gt; I've given you my words of promise." Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said he associated his name with God's name. God is Elohim. How how many knows that the great Jehovah Elohim, the allsufficient one, the self-existing one, Elohim, how what what did he do? He gave the HM off of his name, placed it on Abraham's name and made and he because he become Abraham. God is the father of all. Abraham is the father of nations. Glory Elohim the father of all. Abraham the father of nations placing positionally. Now then in this same chapter, he gives him a sign. gives the Pentecostal church a sign of the end. After that, Abraham had his name changed a few days. Amen. He was placed then as Elohim associated with God. Oh, you know it. You know, isn't it good to be a holy ruler? Placed him, associated him with God. Give him part of his name. What kind of a name does his church have? His name. THAT'S RIGHT. I COME IN MY FATHER'S name and you receive me not. Jesus said Jesus name I'm another if another will come in their name his name organization you'll receive it but he associated Abraham with his name and his church has his name &gt;&gt; can you say amen &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; what is this what is this to do as we begin to to to stop here and now we understand that the that the Bible says that there's going to be a church with the names of blasphemy going to have all kinds of blasphemous names, but that's not who you are. Names of blasphemy, Pentecost, Amen. Methodist, and you know, what have you. The these are names of blasphemy. Amen. But see, the bride has not been given the names of blasphemy. They've been given the name of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're looking to this promise because your name originated out of the book of life. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want us to look I want us to think as as I begin as I think about the three women. And I dare say to you that there really isn't a true type in these three women for the church. Brother Brandham would or for the bride, brother Brandham would talk about the three women. Amen. in in connection with with the seed of Abraham, there was there was uh Sarah who was given the promise and um now now Sarah was a free woman &gt;&gt; and through sex uh she bore a natural nation. Then there was Hagar the bondswoman he meant sex adultery. She produced a wild nation. Then the prophet said that there would come a marry with no sex at all. She was virgin and she birthed the word. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; she produced it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; BUT AS BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD GO ON, AMEN, I find that I can't find myself with any of those three women. You say, now how is this going to be? And and and you say, h how can you not see yourself in Mary's typology? She was a virgin and and and she produced Jesus, but Mary was not God's bride. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Mary was not God's bride. Amen. She was a carrier of life. And brother Brandham would would would would say, amen, that the church will come through justification through Luther, sanctification through Wesley, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the Pentecostals, and go right on into the perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the self-same persons. God will be so manifested into his bride, his church, till they be that they will both be the same. They are one. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he we would we would go down and and and brother brother Brandham would talk about how that Amen. You talk about the three women and and and he would say Mary not through sex but through faith something exactly like it. Mary was not the seed. Mary was a carrier of the seed. HE WAS THE GENUINE FAITH seed because the word of God is by faith that he gave to Abraham. Only faith can produce what God said he would do. Faith in his word. Notice how more uh how more like the real thing Mary was, but she was the uh but like THE SHUCK. THE SHUCK HOLDS HUGS the seed in itself and protects it and nurture nurtures it until it's standing alone and mature. So has this third church age of Pentecost matured holding this grain until it's time to open THE SHOCK. &gt;&gt; SO WE'RE NOT EVEN WE CAN'T EVEN FIND our type in Mary. OUR TYPE IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Now again he would go he would go back through it. Wesley was type of Sarah. The Philadelphiaian age of love brought forth the tassel in Wesley's age. There was more missionaries than ever uh uh than any other age we've had. The great missionary age of Wesley's time. But Pentecost represented Mary. Mary the the last the last stage of it. Now she was not the seed yet. The life of the seed was in her but it hadn't matured yet. I feel religious. It hadn't matured yet. It was there but it wasn't matured. So it is with our Pentecostal age that we're living in. THEY'VE GOT TO COME FORTH, THERE'S GOT TO come forth a word of God. AMEN. THE INTERDENOMINATIONAL OUTSIDE OF THE REALMS OF THE DENOMINATION. Uh Luther went to the hus with his word, just shall live by faith. Wesley had two words, sanctification. Second definite WORK OF GRACE. PENTECOST HAD THE third word, restoration of the gifts. BUT THE ENTIRE SEED HAS TO COME FORTH. NOW see how they denominate on the word and another and another. Amen. ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS THE SHOCK IS A CARRIER. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT OUR DENOMINATIONS has been a carrier. LUTHER WESLEY PENTECOSTALS. AND NOW IT'S time for the seed to come forth. She was not THE SEED. MARY WAS NOT. SHE WAS A SHOCK TASSEL STOP CARRIERS OF THAT PART OF the word but not all the word. Luther had justification. Wesley had sanctification. Pentecostals had restoration. But when the word come, they could produce what the justification will save a man. And and I believe that it's a carrier of the word. THE SAME AS THE STALK is part of the wheat. Sure it is. But it's a carrier. It ain't the life. And along come sanctification. How many believe in sanctification? You believe the Bible? You have to. Sure. So still it's a little more might be two words but then come the Pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tonesues they call it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tonesues there and there they call the initial evidence amen that's the shock they denominated but when you can say I and my father are ONE THESE OTHER THINGS THEN THE SHUCK PULLS BACK NOW HE'S TRYING TO say when you say somebody say me &gt;&gt; when you say I and my father ARE ONE THE SHUCK PULLS WAY THE REAL GENUINE BRIDE church will bring forth THE ENTIRE WORD OF GOD in its fullness in the in the midst for he's the same yesterday today and forever another quote we SEE HERE THE TRUE REVELATION OF THE TRUE TYPE THERE ARE THREE WOMEN CARRIERS of the natural seed until the matured into Jesus another one CANNOT DO IT NOW IT IS SEED TIME OR BRIDE TIME, THE SHUCKS ARE DEAD, THE DRIED UP, THE VIRGIN WORD TIME, not touched. Remember, virgin word time. Amen. In the third seal, he he says he says now, Amen. Uh uh and I and I'm putting a lot of these in here, but I just want y'all to catch this. Amen. Y'all can go back and look at these later. It says then the the third the three stages come come uh the the church out from sanctification or justification, SANCTIFICATION, BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE incarnate God made manifest among us. Here he come the as the antichrist, the false prophet and then the beast then the dark age. Amen. But then the church come OUT OF THE DARK AGE, JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, baptism of the Holy Ghost, incarnate word, the way now. So there's A THERE'S SOMETHING I'M TRYING TO I'M I'M TRYING TO GET TO YOU HERE IS HE'S NOT PUTTING you Amen. AS A HE'S NOT HE'S NOT HE'S NOT LOOKING AT HUMANITY AT ALL. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT LOOKING AT HUMANITY AT ALL. HE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING AT AT AT MARY. HE'S LOOKING AT A SPECIAL CONDITION that you are. YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN PRODUCING. You are the very WIFE OF GOD AND you are producing his word in your flesh. &gt;&gt; It means something. It means something. It makes you It makes YOU WANT TO STAY TRUE to that. He is your husband. He is your Lord. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he he goes on. He says, "Here comes the Antichrist, the false prophet, and and uh or I've done read that one." He says, "Notice here, the life that was in the stalk tessle ends up in the seed. The life comes out. The original seed comes up through the different processes, three different processes, and then turns back to its original condition." In the masterpiece, he says there, see the three stages, stock, tassel, or pollen, then the husk, and then out of the husk, the original seed. Not a seed. It was the life of the seed growing through this to come to the seed. What is it? A resurrection coming back to a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says Pentecost came out of Wesley because Wesley was an organization. Pentecost came out as no organization. Then it turned right back to one. Amen. It had to to make the husk. The true word of life on it was on its way then to the original grain through the three stages. Amen. The stock and the pollen, the pollen into the husk and the husk made it seed. No. Stock, tassel, husk living. &gt;&gt; Someone say stock &gt;&gt; tassel. &gt;&gt; Husk &gt;&gt; living. &gt;&gt; God's used those things. God used Hagar. God used Sarah. God use Mary. Amen. But here you are today. God couldn't even have another type that he could use. [laughter] You become the very word of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Oh, that's the anointing that's upon you today. AMEN. NOW, I COULD JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON. AMEN. There's there's there's a lot of quotes in there. Another place in the Master of Peace, he says, Amen. He he says, "Justification made way for sanctification. Sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself. How can this be? I don't know. But I just say I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can this be? I'm in a I'm struggling AS A YOUNG WOMAN. I'M STRUGGLING AS A YOUNG MAN. I I don't know. But all I know is God's got a bride on this earth that says I believe the word. Can you say amen? Amen. Oh my. AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT BE. AMEN. Brother Brandham in the restoration of the bride tree. He says now, he says, you can see the four messengers of death killed the tree. The four messengers of life restores the tree. Do you get it? Amen. God said, I will restore it. He's going to restore it now by the four messengers of death kill it. Four messengers of life to restore it. Amen. The first Martin Luther justification. What was the second? Wesley by sanctification. What was the third? Pentecost. Restoration of the gifts, Holy Ghost, baptism. WHAT IS THE FOURTH? THE WORD. WHAT? THE WORD. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY. HALLELUJAH. God has He's got so much confidence in you. He's got so much confidence. He's not looking at your flesh. He's not looking at your ability. He's looking at the faith that he has predestinated you. Amen. That anointing is upon the earth. You're going to make it. There is no way for you to miss this because you are ordained to hear it. You are ordained to believe it. THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT WILL NOT LET YOU. Come on now. Amen. Oh yeah, they can try to beat. Amen. It ain't it ain't the preacher beating you. It ain't mom and dad beating you. It's because the life of God that is uh from the throne of God here on this earth. It is a it's a RAPTURE ANOINTING. IT'S THE FLYING EAGLE TIME. It's It's coming to bring us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you are that very word. &gt;&gt; You look in the mirror and you're seeing all the grays and the wrinkles and you're seeing all the complexes. God's looking at you and he's just beaming with pride. His word is here and you're believing it and it's you're going to produce what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; When we sing that song, "Oh, I love him. Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave his life for me and you." But you see this today, we're not we're we're not in the in the Hagar stage and we're not in the Sarah stage and we're not even in the Mary stage. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Means a lot, folks. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Mary Mary was she was the incubator. Amen. But God is calling you the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought it was wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] Brother, brother brother, brother brother Brown, brother Brown would say, listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age. What he says FROM GOD, THE BRIDE will say, the bride and the prophet and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will BE SAYING THE SAME THING. &gt;&gt; And what they say will have already been said in the word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? THE WORD HAS BECOME WORD. WE'VE COME TO THAT. OH, HALLELUJAH. It's easy for us. It's easy for us to make all of those apostles and the saints in in the book of Acts angels. Hallelujah. But I'm here to tell you there was a lot of there was a lot of humanity there. Well, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Peter, the one that was given the keys to the kingdom, went and and and gave gave the life to uh preached the gospel to the Gentiles. He was the first one to take him. Amen. Then we find out a chapter or two older that that that he is causing dissension. Amen. He's playing he's he's two-faced when he's with the Jews. He's with the Jews and then and then when the and and then when the Jews come in where the Gentiles were at, well, he was uhoh. He was trying to be nice with one or nice to the other. And uh and and then he because he was afraid of the Jews, he comes over and joins in and and ignores the Gentiles. And the Apostle Paul says,"I withtood him to his face and said, "You're wrong." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're causing dissension and you shouldn't be doing that. And well, that was in the that was that was our two apostles. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that that what what I'm saying is there's there were hum there was humanity that was there when the word w was was &gt;&gt; Yeah. when the the church that we are to approximate, the church that we're trying to be like is they had a lot of humanity. &gt;&gt; Is that right? But the word was their absolute. Then we've gone through all of these other things and we've had all of these other ideas. Listen, we are not based on ideas anymore. We don't care what mama thinks, daddy thinks, grandma thinks. We don't care what the preacher thinks if it's not according to the word of God. We want what God's brought to us. AND THAT'S ALL THE BRIDE WILL hear &gt;&gt; because we have arrived &gt;&gt; once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not one word will be broken because she believes it all. Lots of mistakes, lots of failures, plenty of blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that faith is going to anchor to thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now I quoted a lot out of the uh uh the seed is not heir with the shuck I and and then uh uh uh in 65 also there in the masterpiece in ' 65 and then we also used uh amen uh transformation of his word. Amen. These were all these were all messages just right there toward the end. And and here but but here in 65 uh seed is not heir with the shuck. He would say but when you say I and my father are one and these other things then the shuck pulls away. But the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness &gt;&gt; in their midst. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said preparation sent the messenger with a message. The next thing he done, [music] he sent the messenger or he he says he sent the messenger with a message. Then he sent the pillar of fire for a vindication. Next thing was after that was a consolation. You knew that it was right. You was at peace. We have [music] peace through with God through the Lord Jesus Christ. And I say, "Oh, amen." Amen. Trying to do God a service without being his will. He said, "The evening message must carry evening results. The evening message must sew evening seeds. Not morning seeds. Evening seeds. it seeds. Back there was denomination. It died and perished. But the evening message will show evening time light and it will show evening time results. [music] The evening time message. And I say, Lord, I thank you for that. I I I [laughter] I think we're just we're we're we're right back. We're right back to the to [music] Mary, but in a more intimate way. God has taken you [music] as his bride. Mary, Virgin Mary, was not the bride of God. Amen. As the Catholic Church wants to put her, right? See, the Catholic Church [music] has taken mother, son, and father, and that's anyways. But tonight, this is legitimate. We are wearing the wedding band of predestinated grace. I love him. I [music] say that through through it all, and I know I ran through this real quick, but I just wanted to share it tonight. I I say that no matter what you're facing, [music] there's there's some of you here that's that's going through the change of life. You're doing that as a young man, young woman. [music] Those times can be a little bit rocky, but to know that you're secured in Jesus makes it so wonderful. And because of this of this change, there's going to be a lot of words said that you regret. There's going to be attitudes that you might have that and and [music] the devil will use those things with you young people to keep you [music] from prayer and but when there's condemnation and you're feeling [music] condemned, you're not going to pray with faith. You're not going to have a whole lot of confidence. You're not going to have that. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And so the reason I wanted to bring all these quotes in, I brought a bunch of them in here tonight as Sarah struggled sometimes with that word in her part. Yet there came a Mary that says, "Be it unto me according to thy [music] word." We have come through the Hagars, the denominational systems. We have come [music] through the Sarah. We have come through, as the prophets would say, the shuck which the Lord manifested [music] himself through in the Pentecostal realm. But he said there's going to come one that he's going to manifest [music] his word, not just gifts, but he's going to manifest he himself, the Holy Ghost himself [music] coming and living. And I would say for any of you young men, young women, and sometimes I am not condoning sin. I'm not condoning sin. But I am saying there is a blood sacrifice for our sins. And when we repent [music] and we come to God, he is faithful and just [music] to forgive. our sins. Sometimes then you elders come along where [music] maybe you're going through menopause for you ladies and I don't know if [music] they call it menopause for guys or not. I think they just call it the midlife crisis for us guys. I don't know. But it's a changing time. And in that changing time, things get really, really wobbly. Things get a little blurry. [music] Maybe you say things that you thought, man, I would never would have said that. Or think ways, well, what I want. Where's that coming from? It's a you're getting upset or things bother you. You get nervous. things. Listen, there's still the [music] blood of Christ. The blood of Calvary is still for you. And in all of these things, remember the God that you have held to all throughout your life is going to take you right through that change of life. And if it helps you any at all, Brother Brandham says when you come through it, you're going to be [music] better than new. So, we go through those things and sometimes we feel we're feeling the the the the the [music] anxieties and things are there because the hormones and the things are going go going a little bit wacky or maybe a whole lot wacky. But Satan comes in with condemnation. And that's what I'm dealing with. Satan comes in and a and he takes this physical [music] thing that you're facing or that you're fighting and then he wants to whack you over the head with it. God is not even he's not comparing you to Hagar. He's not comparing you to Sarah. He's not even comparing you to Mary. You're his very own. Are you hearing me? So what we do is we come to [music] the Lord. We spend that time in prayer because if you can get condemnation, what we need in all of these times of our lives, we need that relationship with the Lord. And condemnation comes in and starts criticizing you and making [music] you feel like you're not one of his. Well, you know what? He's He's a liar. And he tries to take advantage of you and your weaknesses. He's not stupid. He tries to take advantage of us all. But when I look back at the grace that God [music] gave Sarah and when it was all said and done, she says, "The Lord [music] hath made me to laugh. The Lord has turned my sorrow into joy." Isaac means laughter. God turned it all around. God was with her the entire time. And I say yes, God [music] is with his people. Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] And me. Oh, how he loves [music and singing] you and me. [singing] [music] He gave &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Jesus. Oh, how you love me. &gt;&gt; Oh, how you love me, Lord. Oh, how he loves you &gt;&gt; and me. Oh, how he loves you. &gt;&gt; Jesus, [music] I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. [singing] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, how [singing] he loves you, &gt;&gt; oh Jesus. Oh, how he loves you. &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] how [music] he loves you. And [singing] &gt;&gt; let's try a verse. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. To Jesus to Calary. [music] He did go. [singing] His love [music] for mankind. Show [singing and music] what he did. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, how he loves you. &gt;&gt; Oh, how he loves me. [music] Oh, he loves you and he's [music] the architect. He's the author. He's right. He wrote the story. You are the actor that he invented. You, Rihanna, [music] you you you like writing writing stories. You're the author. [music] You have the right to make the good, bad, and ugly. It's your prerogative. [music] You're the author. Well, God's the author of redemption. There's always got to be the villain. [music] There's got to be the damsel in distress and there's got to be the hero. If not, a guy don't want to read your stuff. [music] Amen. We want to see action. And make sure you make the hero God's writing [music] your story. The Apostle Paul says, "How can [music] the thing formed say to the one who formed it?" Why? Hey, in other words, for you that that he's shown mercy to what what right do you have to say, hey, why do you love me? I'm a failure. Hey, I quit. WHY? BECAUSE I'M JUST NOT THE I'M JUST NOT THE GUY. YEAH, YOU ARE. [music] I wrote the script. God's broke the script the script. Your name's [music] in the book. It's who you are. That's why you have desire. Desire to please him. Desire to love him. Desire. You're in the book. Relax. Fall in love with me. can't understand why, but I love you for it. Don't understand it all. You're infinite in your ways. But I'm here to tell you, I'm sure glad to be a part of the [music] story and the good side of the story at that. It's all the way God sees us. He loves every [music] one of you. Loves every one of us. Those those of us that are just coming up, those of us that should know better, God loves us. God [music] loves us when we're full of vigor. God loves us when we're at the end of our days. God loves us. He loves us. God bless you. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; I don't know what you all feel out there, but [music] I just feel a real sweetness here tonight. is God. I think God is pleased that he wants to come [music] to you and let you know that he loves you. And I say, I want to love him. I want to love him more. I want to [music] love him greater than I've ever loved you. Mikey, I love you, Lord. [music] I love you, Lord. love you with all of my heart, Father. Thank you for your call. Thank you for your grace. Thank you for this message. Oh Jesus, you're everything to us.
