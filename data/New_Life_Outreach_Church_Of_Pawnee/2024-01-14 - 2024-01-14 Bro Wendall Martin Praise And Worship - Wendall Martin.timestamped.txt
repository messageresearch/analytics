[1:12:17] I just feel maybe it will bless someone
[1:12:19] so we're going to give a short testimony
[1:12:21] and then I'll sing this song which um
[1:12:24] has been a blessing to me um when I was
[1:12:26] 16 I I grew up in the message and um we
[1:12:31] we had the P privilege of listening to
[1:12:33] tapes I'm from the Netherlands but I
[1:12:36] didn't meet the true Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:39] that yet I didn't have a born again
[1:12:41] experience and I was praying God I said
[1:12:44] God if I I wanted to do something with
[1:12:47] my whole heart I said I don't want to
[1:12:48] just be a churchgoer I don't want to be
[1:12:51] just serving the lord because my parents
[1:12:54] taught me that I want to have a true
[1:12:56] experience of you and there was um a a
[1:13:00] little camp meeting it was uh it was
[1:13:03] just a small little youth meeting and it
[1:13:05] was in kind of like a forest area with
[1:13:07] some uh some D sand dunes and so one
[1:13:10] morning I got up early in the morning
[1:13:12] and I I just felt so burdened I needed
[1:13:14] to know God I needed to know if this
[1:13:16] message was true and if there was still
[1:13:18] a living God that is still the same
[1:13:20] yesterday today and forever because I
[1:13:22] didn't want to a message from 50 years
[1:13:24] back I wanted a living God now and I
[1:13:27] knelt down in the sand dunes and I
[1:13:30] poured my heart out to God and I said
[1:13:32] God if you're true please show me and at
[1:13:37] that time the Whirlwind came and came
[1:13:40] circling down and it was like God came
[1:13:43] to me and and and said don't look at
[1:13:46] what others
[1:13:47] do there's a true message and there's a
[1:13:52] true Living God and I I'll show you the
[1:13:54] way as long as you stand for me and live
[1:13:57] for me so you know
[1:14:01] sometimes I feel like you walk in the
[1:14:04] Lord gets like in a habit you know you
[1:14:07] go to church and you you know but
[1:14:10] sometimes God just needs to give you
[1:14:11] another touch so the song that I'm going
[1:14:14] to sing it's been a long time so bear
[1:14:16] with me I'm not a perfect singer but
[1:14:18] it's has been a blessing for me and I
[1:14:21] hope it will be a blessing to you
[1:14:28] [Music]
