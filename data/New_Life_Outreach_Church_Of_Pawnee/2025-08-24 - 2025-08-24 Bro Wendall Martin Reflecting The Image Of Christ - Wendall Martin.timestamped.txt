[9:05] she's been dealing with these blood
[9:07] clots and is in the hospital. Lord,
[9:10] Lord, we pray that you would just, Lord,
[9:12] move on the scene in a special way,
[9:14] Lord. Lord, you Lord, we heard our
[9:16] pastor mention this morning that she had
[9:18] been kind of down as she continues to
[9:21] battle these different health things,
[9:22] Lord. And Lord, we pray that you would

[9:35] that even if she may be

[9:39] ailments, that there's still a God that
[9:43] loves her. There's still a God there to

[10:04] can't say that enough, Lord. It's what
[10:05] you promised in your scriptures that
[10:07] that by your stripes were healed, Lord.
[10:09] Lord, we right now just apply those
[10:12] stripes to to these sisters, Lord, and
[10:14] pray that you would heal them, that you
[10:16] would strengthen, that you would lift

[10:49] experienced this kind of tragedy, Lord.
[10:51] But but Lord, we know that you're the
[10:54] comforter, Lord.
[10:57] Lord, we know that as was sung this
[11:00] morning, Lord, that Lord, you promise in
[11:04] in Psalm 23, Lord, that though we walk
[11:06] through the shadow of death, Lord,
[11:07] though we go through the dark places,
[11:09] though we're in the valleys where it
[11:11] seems like we're all alone, Lord, that
[11:14] you're still there with us, Lord, and
[11:15] that you are the great shepherd, Lord.
[11:18] That you're the one that helps us get
[11:19] through every situation in in life that
[11:22] we face, Lord, every struggle, every
[11:24] problem, Lord. And Lord, I pray right
[11:27] now that you would be with the OldTake
[11:29] family in a special way. Lord, be with
[11:31] Brother William and Sister Sharon as
[11:33] they're on the road traveling. Lord, as
[11:35] they would be
[11:37] picking up Brother Robert and Sister
[11:38] Brianna, and then continuing to travel.
[11:40] I pray that you would watch over them on
[11:42] the road, Lord. That you would keep them
[11:44] awake and alert, Lord, that you would
[11:45] place your angels around them to bring
[11:47] them safely to to their destination,
[11:49] Lord. And Lord, I pray that you would
[11:50] give each one of them the the words to
[11:53] speak, Lord, to be a comfort to the
[11:54] family that's been left behind, Lord.
[11:57] Lord, this is
[12:00] Lord, it's a sad situation, Lord. It's a
[12:02] tragedy, Lord. But Lord, we know that
[12:04] you can take these kind of situations,
[12:06] Lord, and you can bring about good from
[12:08] it, Lord. You can you can bring about a
[12:10] testimony, Lord. And Lord, we pray that
[12:12] you would just, Lord, work on the lives
[12:15] of those that are left behind, Lord.
[12:16] that you would be able to receive the
[12:17] glory at the end of it. What Satan would
[12:20] have meant for evil, Lord, that you
[12:21] could have brought about for good,
[12:24] Lord. We lift before you the service
[12:25] this evening, Lord. And Lord, we pray
[12:27] that you would just help us to enter
[12:28] into your worship, Lord. Help us to
[12:30] enter in to your atmosphere, Lord. That
[12:32] you would be able to minister to our
[12:34] hearts, that you would be able to just
[12:35] speak to us, Lord. That we would leave
[12:37] tonight knowing that that we've been in
[12:39] your presence, Lord. Lord, we just thank
[12:42] you for all that you do for us. and we

[31:40] the God that is holy is with us. Wasn't
[31:44] that Moses was holy,

[35:23] Thankful, Lord,
[35:26] for the glorious image that we see in
[35:28] Christ.
[35:31] Thankful Lord
[35:34] that you didn't leave us to serve
[35:38] idols of stone and wood figment of our
[35:41] imagination.
[35:44] But God, you've given us a reality in
[35:47] you.
[35:49] And we love you, Lord.
[35:51] We love you with all of our heart.
[35:55] Now, Father, as we
[35:57] approach this sacred desk again tonight,
[36:02] we just ask, Lord, that you would
[36:05] circumcise our hearts and our thoughts.
[36:09] Let us walk with you,
[36:12] Lord, in the cool of the evening as you
[36:15] done with Adam. Speak to our hearts,
[36:18] Lord.
[36:20] We just ask, Father, that you would be
[36:22] with us in a real special way tonight.
[36:26] We just thank you for all of your grace
[36:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[36:33] Can the church say amen?
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; And amen. Well, good evening. Good to be
[36:39] in the house of the Lord today.
[36:42] And um I um totally forgot to uh uh wish
[36:50] brother Paul a happy birthday this
[36:52] morning.
[36:53] 14 years old. He turned yesterday
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:03] and um so we wish you a happy birthday.
[37:07] And um I wonder if we could just sing
[37:09] that sing a happy birthday song to
[37:11] brother brother Paul. Happy birthday
[37:15] to you.
[37:19] Happy birthday
[37:21] to you brother Paul. Happy birthday
[37:27] brother Paul and Casper.
[37:31] Happy birthday
[37:34] to you.
[37:36] May Jesus
[37:39] bless you.
[37:42] May Jesus
[37:45] bless you.
[37:48] May Jesus
[37:50] bless brother Paul Lancaster
[37:54] the whole
[37:57] year through.
[38:00] God bless you. I want to tell you,
[38:03] brother Paul is a very fine young man
[38:07] and uh we love him. And so my goodness,
[38:10] he just told him today just growing up
[38:12] too fast. And um so we love we love
[38:17] brother Paul. Let's look here while
[38:19] we're while we're standing. Let's just
[38:21] look at St. John the 3 chapter. Just
[38:24] going to read the 16th verse.
[38:28] And um um
[38:31] we uh sure appreciate the meal today.
[38:36] Thanks for for the hard work and and um
[38:40] and it's just it was just wonderful.
[38:42] Thanks to all you all you ladies. We
[38:45] love you. Now um St. John uh 3:16, for
[38:51] God so loved the world
[38:54] that he gave his only begotten son
[38:58] that whosoever believeth in him should
[39:02] not perish but have have everlasting
[39:05] life. For God sent not his son into the
[39:07] world to condemn the world, but that the
[39:10] world through him might be saved. He
[39:13] that believes on him is not condemned,
[39:15] but he that believes not is condemned
[39:17] already because he hath not believed in
[39:20] the name of the only begotten son of
[39:22] God. This is the condemnation. Now, he's
[39:25] going to tell us why the condemnation is
[39:27] there. That light is come into the world
[39:31] and men loves darkness more than light
[39:35] because their deeds were evil. For
[39:38] everyone that does evil hates the light,
[39:42] neither comes to the light, lest his
[39:44] deeds be reproved, but he that do the
[39:48] truth comes to the light, that his deeds
[39:52] may be manifest, that they are wrought
[39:55] in God. Let's go to the Lord in prayer
[39:57] once again. Father, we just want to
[39:59] thank you for your goodness and for your
[40:01] love. Now Lord, we just ask that you
[40:04] would help us these next few moments.
[40:06] Lord, as I give myself to you in the
[40:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the
[40:11] church say amen?
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be
[40:16] seated here this evening. So God gives
[40:20] Amen. God so loved. God so loved that he
[40:24] gave. Amen. Now we find as we as we look
[40:28] here this morning, Amen. the great the
[40:32] great
[40:34] uh
[40:35] redemption plan, the red redemptive plan
[40:39] of God and how that God had to create a
[40:43] body. Amen. For him to move in. And we
[40:48] we remember that, Amen. the DNA of God
[40:53] was all in that great pillar of fire.
[40:56] And that great pillar of fire
[40:58] overshadowed the womb of Mary. Amen. And
[41:04] and what was it? It was God continuing
[41:06] on. God becoming flesh. God coming on
[41:10] down.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was the invisible God. And
[41:14] then God, Amen. brought a form out of
[41:18] himself. Out of God comes this form. And
[41:20] God moves into that.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he's working through
[41:25] prophets and he's declaring that he's
[41:27] coming. A body is coming. He's declaring
[41:30] a virgin's going to conceive. He's he's
[41:32] showing all of these things. These are
[41:34] all prophetic. It's all the logos that's
[41:37] coming down until it comes to the to to
[41:41] Mary. And then the one who gave the
[41:45] promise. Now remember, 800 years ago, a
[41:48] virgin shall conceive. I'm going to give
[41:50] you a sign. 800 years ago. Amen. Uh that
[41:54] this is when Jesus time, not 800 years
[41:56] ago for us, but 800 years before Jesus.
[41:58] Amen. Uh um and and a son is going to be
[42:02] born and you're going to call him the
[42:04] everlasting father, the almighty God.
[42:08] You're going to call him the prince of
[42:09] peace. God's declaring, "Amen, as I have
[42:12] come out of the invisible, now I'm here
[42:14] in the pillar of fire. Israel can see
[42:17] me." Amen. They followed the pillar of
[42:19] fire by day. The prophets all seen that
[42:22] great pillar of fire. The power of God
[42:25] was with that pillar of fire. Elijah
[42:28] seen and was even caught up in that
[42:30] pillar of fire. Moses was caught up into
[42:32] the fire when he received the law. Amen.
[42:36] But now it's going to keep on coming
[42:38] down
[42:40] and down until it's in the body of Jesus
[42:44] Christ. And Jesus Christ is going to
[42:47] hold all of the DNA of God. Amen. The
[42:50] glory of God and God is going to be
[42:53] made. And that's what the scripture
[42:55] said. In the beginning was the word. Uh
[42:57] John 1 and 1. In the beginning was the
[43:00] word. The word was with God. The word
[43:04] was God. The same was in the beginning
[43:09] with God. And all things were created by
[43:13] him. And without him was not anything
[43:17] that was made. 14th verse. Now, amen.
[43:21] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[43:26] among us, and we beheld his glory.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God becoming human, God come
[43:37] coming on down and down and down and
[43:40] down until he walked on earth with us.
[43:44] until we could see in our own human
[43:48] eyes. Amen. Uh um uh there in in uh 1
[43:52] John 1 and1, Sister Kala. Amen. We could
[43:56] see the word. Amen. That which was from
[43:59] the beginning, which we have heard,
[44:02] which we have seen with our eyes, which
[44:05] we have looked upon and our hands have
[44:08] handled of the word of life. This was
[44:12] John saying we seen this word in a body.
[44:18] We see we held him. We we went we went
[44:22] fishing with him. We we were there when
[44:25] he multiplied the loaves. We were there
[44:28] when he fed the the the the 5,000. Amen.
[44:33] We literally seen the word made flesh.
[44:39] Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to the lamb of God. You see,
[44:44] that's what God had been wanting to do
[44:46] all along. But you see, then after
[44:49] religion comes, religion wants to just
[44:52] make us, Amen, just church people come
[44:55] and sit down in a church and just
[44:57] worship a God of way back there
[44:59] yesterday. But God wants to be not just
[45:02] in Jesus of 2,000 years ago, but the
[45:06] whole plan of redemption was that they
[45:09] would go, remember when Jesus raised
[45:11] from the dead. Amen. And he tells them
[45:14] and and as as we have dealt with lately,
[45:16] he tells them, "Go back to Jerusalem."
[45:19] And what does he do? The Bible says he
[45:23] &gt;&gt; blows on them and says, "Receive
[45:27] the Holy Spirit. Receive." Amen. Go back
[45:30] and look at it and it says the breath of
[45:33] God, the very thing that caused the
[45:36] logos,
[45:38] the very Christ, he says, "Go to
[45:41] Jerusalem into that upper room until you
[45:45] receive this very thing that made Jesus
[45:49] who he was."
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how much the Apostle Paul
[45:54] says. He says, "You have received the
[45:58] very spirit of Christ." Look at it in
[46:02] your Bible. Amen. He You have received
[46:06] the spirit of Christ. What is he saying?
[46:09] The very thing, the very logos in the
[46:12] beginning that created the whole world,
[46:15] the very thing that is sustaining the
[46:17] world, the very thing that is that is
[46:19] causing Amen. the prophets to speak over
[46:24] 1600 years and none of them in this
[46:28] Bible ever missed it. And I want to say
[46:31] even the prophecies of this day today.
[46:35] There are prophecies that are going on
[46:37] right now that was spoken thousands. How
[46:41] could these guys do it? It was that
[46:44] logos of God. It was what God said in
[46:48] the beginning. He's he listen there is
[46:51] no guessing because God has no
[46:54] tomorrows. God has no yesterdays.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; God is in the right now and he's making
[47:02] himself known to mortals like me and
[47:06] you.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. See, he didn't leave
[47:11] us. Now, every other religion, you are
[47:14] worshiping uh you're worshiping the sun.
[47:18] You're worshiping the moon or you're
[47:19] worshiping a a a a creature. You you are
[47:23] you you are worshiping a you know you
[47:26] can worship anything. But this God, the
[47:29] God of all gods, is not wanting us just
[47:33] to to come to church to worship. He
[47:36] wants to worship with his people.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say now now how no no no. God
[47:45] don't want to worship with his people.
[47:47] Well, let's just all turn there real
[47:48] quick. Let's look here in the book of
[47:49] Hebrews. Amen. And we'll look. Hebrews
[47:54] 2.
[47:56] Amen. Oh, how many loves him?
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, if we go to
[48:04] Hebrews
[48:05] and let's just start, man, two and five.
[48:09] But unto the angels,
[48:12] has he not put in subjection the world
[48:15] to come, whereof we speak? For but one
[48:18] in a certain place testified, saying,
[48:21] What is man,
[48:24] that thou art mindful of him?
[48:27] Were the Son of man that thou should
[48:29] visit him? Thou madeest him a little
[48:32] lower than the angels. Thou thou
[48:34] crownest him with glory and honor and
[48:37] did set him over the work of of thy
[48:39] hands. Talking about Adam, Adam had the
[48:42] authority. Adam walked with God. Adam
[48:46] was made in the image of God. Now watch.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; He says he says um uh thou hast put all
[48:53] things in subjection under him.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; For him that he he put all in subjection
[49:01] under him. He left nothing that is not
[49:04] under him. But now we see uh not yet all
[49:07] things put under him. In other words,
[49:09] since the fall, here we are. We've been
[49:11] in our uh uh we've been in limbo. We
[49:14] we've been in But watch. Amen. We we see
[49:17] not yet all things put under him. But we
[49:20] see Jesus. Now he's saying now man's not
[49:25] where he once was, but we see Jesus. Now
[49:30] watch this.
[49:32] Keep that in mind. Who was made a little
[49:35] lower than the angels for the suffering
[49:37] of death, crowned with glory and honor,
[49:42] that he by the grace of God should taste
[49:45] death for every man. For it become him
[49:49] for whom are all things and by whom are
[49:53] all things in bringing
[49:56] many sons unto glory. Now watch. Man was
[50:02] given that by God.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sin come in. Amen. He lost
[50:09] that position. God in his great mind
[50:12] coming down. Coming down to redeem that
[50:15] God in a body put Amen. died on the
[50:20] cross for you and for me so that he can
[50:23] bring you and me back into the glory
[50:27] that we fell from.
[50:29] Do you want to know why? You want to
[50:31] know why Satan has come in this last day
[50:34] the way he has? Amen. With drugs.
[50:38] Listen, there there it's the statistics
[50:41] say that there are uh uh
[50:45] uh one out of three uh Americans that
[50:48] are that are uh uh that are dependent on
[50:52] drug. Uh uh these are these are from
[50:54] from the doctors. And and so that's
[50:57] that's quite a that that that's quite an
[50:59] astounding thing because the majority
[51:02] Amen. We got drugs for everything.
[51:04] Everything's for Amen. And and and and I
[51:08] I I look at this here. We are right at
[51:10] the end of the day where it takes away
[51:13] our desperation the way that we really
[51:15] need it.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Because desperation
[51:19] desperation you don't you don't you
[51:21] don't hear of deathbed confessions
[51:22] anymore. Why? Because we have got we
[51:26] have got drugs in our system. Amen. And
[51:29] to where they'll just put you to sleep
[51:30] and you'll just go right on into the
[51:31] glory. I don't care. Or into eternity.
[51:33] And it doesn't matter whether you're a
[51:35] sinner or a saint. Where it used to be.
[51:37] Amen. As you were dying, the sinner
[51:40] would find out, listen, I need to make
[51:42] things right with God. I need to be
[51:44] right. But you see these kinds of things
[51:47] because Satan is trying to numb our
[51:50] expectations for what God is asking us
[51:54] to be.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; He's wanting to numb those things. But I
[51:57] just want to tell you, don't let the
[51:59] devil numb anything on you
[52:02] &gt;&gt; because we are in a day where we are
[52:05] fixing to take over the earth again.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Authority belongs to you.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He gets us. He He wants to get us
[52:14] sidetracked from our purpose. You are
[52:17] the rapturing people.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I truly believe that.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I truly believe there are people sitting
[52:26] in this building tonight that will not
[52:30] see death. The rapture is upon us. We
[52:34] are at this finality.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now I want you to catch this
[52:44] because G, they're going to This is
[52:46] We're fixing to see why Jesus came.
[52:48] Amen. Man fell from that. He was favored
[52:51] of God. Fell from that. Jesus came.
[52:54] Amen. Now, let's let's let's start
[52:56] reading again. It says um for it be the
[53:01] 10th verse. For it became him, for whom
[53:03] are all things, and by whom are all
[53:05] things, in bringing many sons unto
[53:08] glory, to make the captain of their
[53:10] salvation perfect through sufferings.
[53:13] For both he that sanctifies, that's him,
[53:17] and they who are sanctified, that's us,
[53:21] are all of one. For which cause he is
[53:25] not ashamed to call them brethren.
[53:27] Christ
[53:29] Jesus is not ashamed to call you
[53:32] brethren.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; He became one of us, saying, "I will
[53:38] declare thy name unto my brethren, and
[53:43] in the midst of the church, my brethren,
[53:47] will I sing praise unto thee." It's not
[53:51] just God coming, Christ coming and
[53:54] revealing himself to his brethren, but
[53:57] in the midst of the church will he sing
[54:00] praise to him.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; How is this happening? The great God of
[54:05] glory living in you
[54:08] &gt;&gt; until your praise becomes his praise.
[54:12] Until your hands become his hands. Until
[54:15] your Amen. until you becomes you become
[54:19] the very body of that logos. Amen. It is
[54:23] your will to do his will. It is your
[54:25] desire. Amen. He heals the sick through
[54:28] you. He forgives through you. He loves
[54:31] through you. He manifests himself to a
[54:34] dying world through you.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't ever let me get numb to that
[54:41] precious call. Can you say amen? Amen.
[54:44] Now, now he says, "I will declare," 12th
[54:47] verse, I will declare thy name unto my
[54:49] brethren, and in the midst of the church
[54:50] will I sing unto thee. And again, I will
[54:53] put my trust in him. And again, behold,
[54:56] I am the children which God hath given
[54:59] me. For as much then as the children are
[55:03] partakers of flesh and blood, me and
[55:05] you, he also likewise, he also himself
[55:10] likewise took part of the same, that
[55:14] through death he might destroy him that
[55:17] had the power of death, that is the
[55:19] devil, and deliver them who through the
[55:23] fear of death were all their lifetime
[55:25] subject to bondage. Verily he took not
[55:28] on him the nature of angels, but he took
[55:32] on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in
[55:36] all things, somebody say all things, it
[55:38] behooved him to be made like unto his
[55:41] brethren, that he might be a merciful
[55:43] and faithful high priest and things
[55:45] pertaining to God, to make
[55:46] reconciliation for the sins of the
[55:49] people. For in that he himself has
[55:53] suffered being tempted, he is able to
[55:55] secure them that are tempted.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; I say, put that in your pipe and smoke
[56:01] it, devil.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. That makes
[56:06] something really special out of you.
[56:08] We're just I know we're just a bunch of
[56:10] uh uh uh you know rejects maybe from the
[56:13] world and maybe we don't have nice homes
[56:15] or nice cars and maybe maybe we don't we
[56:18] don't fit in with the world in a in a
[56:20] lot of ways. But I tell you what, we fit
[56:22] in with heaven.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; We fit in with heaven.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And he's working his
[56:29] work through us.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want to say, Lord, I want to
[56:36] reflect that image of Christ. If I have
[56:39] been born again, and Sister Keys, could
[56:41] you put up number six? Amen. If I have
[56:44] been born again, and again, the DNA was
[56:47] put in your heart before the foundation
[56:50] of the world. The Bible says it was
[56:52] declared that. It was already put there.
[56:54] God knew you were coming. He knew Wendle
[56:58] Martin would be on this earth in a
[57:01] fallen condition. God seen me. God seen
[57:04] me right here talking to you. God knew I
[57:06] was going to stand just like this at
[57:07] this very moment.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; God knows it all.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; And God knew I was going to be here. God
[57:16] put his seed in me. The genetics of God.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now Jesus though he
[57:24] had the genetics of God, he done no
[57:26] miracles. He done nothing nothing until
[57:30] birth or or or until
[57:34] when he was baptized. So remember the
[57:37] genetics of God if you want to go to the
[57:39] seventh that that seventh slide. Amen.
[57:41] Now now we he couldn't put it there in
[57:43] the you know fallen on Mary because we
[57:45] didn't want to deify Mary. So we just
[57:47] put it in the baby there. But it was the
[57:49] seed of God. Amen. that came in and and
[57:53] brought the son of God that brought
[57:57] Jesus. Can you say amen?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The next slide is when Jesus was
[58:02] at the river, then then the Holy Spirit
[58:07] comes down and energizes that
[58:10] predestinated seed of God that was in
[58:14] him.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, you were the
[58:18] predestinated seed. You were ordained of
[58:22] God, but you had to receive the Holy
[58:25] Spirit. And when it energized that seed,
[58:28] then you become that. Are y'all
[58:30] understanding?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; See, we were born with the genetics of
[58:36] God in our soul.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; But it took the Holy Spirit to come in
[58:40] and make it. And then he comes out of
[58:43] the water tempted by the devil. Amen.
[58:45] But he had all power of heaven and earth
[58:48] within him. Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Now,
[58:52] so I say
[58:55] I want I I I I want us to just think for
[58:57] a moment. Not going to hold you long
[58:58] tonight. Just want to sort of end up on
[59:00] some things that I didn't finish this
[59:02] morning. And that is my purpose, my
[59:06] goal.
[59:10] If Christ had the DNA of God,
[59:14] if Christ had the DNA of God and the I
[59:19] was in that Christ chosen in him, then I
[59:24] just want to say my purpose here on
[59:25] earth is not just to be amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is a supernatural
[59:34] eternal effect that is that is within
[59:37] every one of you.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said as he was as he was about
[59:44] to uh go to Calvary. Amen. And and and
[59:49] we can read it for a moment there there
[59:51] in in St. John the 13th chapter and um
[59:55] uh see 13 and 1 it says now before the
[1:00:00] feast of the Passover when Jesus knew
[1:00:01] that his hour was about to come that he
[1:00:04] should depart out of this world unto the
[1:00:06] father having loved his own which were
[1:00:08] in the world he loved them to the end
[1:00:11] and supper being ended and the devil
[1:00:12] having put into the heart of Judas's
[1:00:15] scar Simon's son to betray him
[1:00:18] but Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:00:20] given all things into his hands and that
[1:00:22] he was come from God and went to God. He
[1:00:25] rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:00:28] garment and took a towel and girded
[1:00:30] himself. And after that he pours water
[1:00:33] into a basin and begins to wash the
[1:00:36] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[1:00:40] towel wherewith he was gird girded. And
[1:00:44] then Peter uh then he come to Simon
[1:00:48] Peter and Peter said unto him,"Lord,
[1:00:50] what does thou wash my feet?" And Jesus
[1:00:52] answered and said, "What I do, thou
[1:00:54] knowest not now, but thou shalt know
[1:00:56] hereafter." If you go down to the 12th
[1:00:58] verse, he said, "After he had washed
[1:01:00] their feet and had taken his garments
[1:01:02] and was sitting down again, he said,
[1:01:05] "Know ye what I have done to you. You
[1:01:08] call me master and Lord, and you say
[1:01:10] well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord
[1:01:14] and Master, have washed your feet, you
[1:01:17] also ought to wash one another's feet.
[1:01:19] For I have given you an example that you
[1:01:22] should do as I have done to you. Verily,
[1:01:25] verily, I say unto you, the servant is
[1:01:28] not greater than his Lord, neither he
[1:01:31] that is sent greater than him that sent
[1:01:35] him. If you know these things, happy are
[1:01:38] you if you do them.
[1:01:41] Now Jesus is here saying now he's he's
[1:01:44] showing us the part of God that he's
[1:01:48] come he was the servant. He was God's
[1:01:51] expression. He was reflecting the image.
[1:01:56] Many times we want to reflect you know
[1:01:58] Christians want to reflect an image. You
[1:02:00] know as I said this morning by wearing a
[1:02:02] certain cloth or clothing or wearing a
[1:02:04] cross or a crucifixion in your home or
[1:02:07] your car going to church. But but that's
[1:02:10] not the reflection. That's not the
[1:02:13] reflection that we're looking for is
[1:02:15] that word reflection. What God has been
[1:02:18] desiring to do all along. And that is
[1:02:22] the ministry of reconciliation.
[1:02:25] Amen. The image. Remember, he was the
[1:02:27] image of that invisible God. What did he
[1:02:30] reflect? He reflected God's God's heart.
[1:02:35] Look, look there at 2 Corinthians 5:18.
[1:02:38] He says, "All things are of God, who has
[1:02:42] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ, and hath given to us the
[1:02:46] ministry of reconciliation, to God was
[1:02:49] in Christ, reconciling the world to
[1:02:52] himself, not imputing their trespasses
[1:02:56] unto them, and hath committed unto us
[1:03:00] the word of reconciliation."
[1:03:04] This is pretty astounding
[1:03:07] because
[1:03:10] God was willing to come in a body
[1:03:14] to give his life unjustly.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; He was killed wrongfully.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; He'd done no sin.
[1:03:24] But the Bible says he did not hold their
[1:03:28] trespasses against them,
[1:03:31] but he forgave them in saying, "Father,
[1:03:34] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:03:36] do." And then he says he's giving you
[1:03:41] this ministry of reconciliation to where
[1:03:44] you can reflect that heartbeat of God
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; just as well. Philippians 2:5 says, "Let
[1:03:51] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:03:56] Christ Jesus, who being in the form of
[1:03:58] God, thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:04:00] with God, but made of himself no
[1:04:02] reputation,
[1:04:04] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:04:11] made in the likeness of men." Can you
[1:04:14] say amen?
[1:04:17] I look at Paul and he says, "Though I
[1:04:19] speak with tongues of men and angels
[1:04:23] and I don't have love,
[1:04:26] I become a sounding brass and tinkling
[1:04:29] symbol. For though I have the gift of
[1:04:32] prophecy
[1:04:33] and understand all mysteries and all
[1:04:36] knowledge, and though I have all faith
[1:04:38] so that I could remove mountains and
[1:04:41] have not love,
[1:04:44] I am nothing. Though I bestow all my
[1:04:47] goods to feed the poor, and though I
[1:04:49] give my body to be burned and have not
[1:04:52] love,
[1:04:53] it profits me nothing.
[1:04:56] When you think of Christ, what do you
[1:04:57] think?
[1:04:59] Love.
[1:05:01] Love.
[1:05:03] And so as I as I as we leave the
[1:05:05] building here tonight,
[1:05:08] I want us to think about the the nature
[1:05:12] of that of the genetics that are within
[1:05:15] your soul. I want you to think about
[1:05:17] that
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; and don't ever come to the reality
[1:05:24] we are or don't don't ever yeah numb to
[1:05:27] the reality of what you're called for
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; to forgive
[1:05:35] is God
[1:05:38] to
[1:05:40] reconcile
[1:05:42] is the nature
[1:05:44] of God.
[1:05:46] Can you say amen? Because remember,
[1:05:50] Amen.
[1:05:52] the the the scripture
[1:05:55] lets us know that Christ was that very
[1:05:58] image of God. He was the expression of
[1:06:02] God in flesh. He was the mercy of God.
[1:06:05] He was the compassion of God. He was the
[1:06:08] judgment of God. He was Amen. you you
[1:06:11] know as I said we used to think that God
[1:06:13] loves me and Jesus or God hates me he's
[1:06:16] mad at me and Jesus loves me and we
[1:06:18] found out that Jesus is simply the body
[1:06:20] that God used to come and redeem me
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; that didn't take away from his justice.
[1:06:27] Justice still had to be paid.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; But he was willing to pay the justice
[1:06:32] when we couldn't do it. Can you say
[1:06:35] amen? He was willing to do what it took
[1:06:39] to bridge the gap when you couldn't
[1:06:41] bridge the gap.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And I say sometimes we get a little bit
[1:06:45] we get a little bit arrogant, don't we?
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; We get a little bit arrogant. We stand
[1:06:49] on our side and we say, "Hey, you know
[1:06:52] what? You have got you you you have
[1:06:55] fallen short or you have hurt me or you
[1:06:57] have done this to me and and I I I'm
[1:07:00] requiring you to do this." But God did
[1:07:02] not do that.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; When God's law was broke, God gave man
[1:07:08] the authority. God was good to place him
[1:07:11] there. And when man blew it all, he blew
[1:07:13] the whole thing.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; And there was nothing that a man could
[1:07:17] do. God was willing
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; to bridge the gap, come himself, pay the
[1:07:23] price to bring reconciliation back to
[1:07:26] mankind.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:28] If God can do that, if the great eternal
[1:07:30] God can do that, Amen. then then how
[1:07:34] about God's great divine Amen. God uh uh
[1:07:38] for you and me?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; What what what what if God can do that
[1:07:42] for for a man? Amen. Then what what what
[1:07:45] about you and me doing that for one
[1:07:47] another should I see? The Bible says
[1:07:49] there in Isaiah 53 and and and three, he
[1:07:53] is despised and rejected of men, a man
[1:07:56] of sorrows, acquainted with grief, and
[1:07:58] we hid as it were our faces from him.
[1:08:00] This is talking about the Christ when he
[1:08:02] come. We He was despised and we esteemed
[1:08:05] him not. Surely he had borne our griefs
[1:08:07] and carried our sorrows. Yet we did
[1:08:10] esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and
[1:08:12] afflicted. But he was wounded for our
[1:08:14] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[1:08:16] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:08:18] peace was put upon him and with his
[1:08:20] stripes we are healed. All we have like
[1:08:23] sheep have gone astray. We have turned
[1:08:25] everyone to his own way. But the Lord
[1:08:28] laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. He was oppressed. He
[1:08:36] was afflicted. Yet he opened not his
[1:08:38] mouth. He has brought as a lamb to the
[1:08:40] slaughter. As a sheep before his sheers
[1:08:42] is dumb. So we openeth not his mouth.
[1:08:46] When Christ came, he expressed the
[1:08:50] heartbeat of God. It was a servant's
[1:08:52] life. He come not to be ministered to
[1:08:56] but to minister.
[1:08:59] Jesus told him, he says, "Now,
[1:09:02] amen." He says, "Don't be many masters."
[1:09:06] Don't be many masters.
[1:09:09] He says masters come and want to be
[1:09:11] served. But he says God's not called us
[1:09:14] to be many masters.
[1:09:18] You're not come to be lorded uh to lord
[1:09:21] over others.
[1:09:24] Amen. But he says you've come to serve.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; You've come to give. And then when
[1:09:31] giving, you're expressing something. Can
[1:09:34] I can I put it back as I was saying this
[1:09:36] morning? Logos is no longer logos. The
[1:09:39] word, this word is no longer logos in
[1:09:41] the church
[1:09:43] because they've got their own ideas and
[1:09:44] opinions that's with it. So the logos,
[1:09:46] but see the logos will still line up
[1:09:49] with this. It'll bring the thoughts of
[1:09:52] God into the pages of God. And as you're
[1:09:55] believing that, you line your thoughts
[1:09:57] up with that, it will produce
[1:10:00] the eternal living word.
[1:10:05] It'll heal. Come on now. God's not made
[1:10:09] us to hate. God's not made us to demand
[1:10:13] our own selves.
[1:10:15] Oh, come on. Only the sick need
[1:10:19] attention. It's the sick that demand
[1:10:22] attention.
[1:10:23] You you you get a man that's demanding
[1:10:25] attention, demanding his rights,
[1:10:28] demanding her rights.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; That that man is sick.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; He's He's looking at himself.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He's not looking at what God's called
[1:10:42] him to do. And as long as you're looking
[1:10:43] inwardly and not outwardly, then you can
[1:10:47] never fulfill your purpose.
[1:10:50] But God's come so that he can fulfill
[1:10:53] his purpose through us.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; God so loved the world that he came. And
[1:11:00] this is the condemnation
[1:11:03] that light has come.
[1:11:06] But man wants to walk in darkness
[1:11:09] because his deeds are evil and they
[1:11:12] don't want him to be made reproved or
[1:11:14] made right. Right. But there's someone
[1:11:17] with the DNA of God when the light comes
[1:11:19] that says, "Oh, get me out of this
[1:11:21] bondage. Get me out of this bondage. I
[1:11:24] want to be free with everything. Every
[1:11:27] God, free me." Oh, how many wants God to
[1:11:31] free you here this morning? Take every
[1:11:33] grudge away. Take every take take every
[1:11:36] Oh, take all my sicknesses away.
[1:11:39] Hallelujah. I I I like it this way here.
[1:11:42] Amen. When When you're anemic, what when
[1:11:44] when you're anemic, that means Amen.
[1:11:46] You're low on blood. And there's I think
[1:11:48] there's too many of too too many in the
[1:11:50] church that gets a little low on blood.
[1:11:52] The the Amen. low on the blood of Jesus.
[1:11:54] Low low on the forgiveness. Low on the
[1:11:57] And when you get low on blood, it's just
[1:11:59] hard to overlook your your your your
[1:12:01] fellow man. But if you're not careful,
[1:12:03] the bitterness will take you right out
[1:12:06] of what God is trying to do in your
[1:12:09] life. If God's trying to do something in
[1:12:11] you and you just remember and it don't
[1:12:13] matter whether you're a pastor, it don't
[1:12:15] matter whether you're you're a spiritual
[1:12:17] person that's been serving the Lord for
[1:12:19] 50 years, Satan will do whatever he can
[1:12:22] to make you bitter. And if he can make
[1:12:23] you bitter, it'll take the very life of
[1:12:26] God out of you. And when he takes the
[1:12:28] life of God of you, you're useless.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can sit there and point and
[1:12:32] condemn. But the law was doing that
[1:12:34] before grace ever got here. Yeah,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; the law was telling everybody where
[1:12:39] they're wrong. But it takes grace. It
[1:12:41] takes the reflection of that invisible
[1:12:44] God, that great God coming down, down,
[1:12:49] down, down, down, down, and living in
[1:12:51] me. Now I can live the life and reflect
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; See? Oh yes.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants.
[1:13:06] Amen. Prophet says, "Brethren, we have
[1:13:09] draws little circles and laws and
[1:13:11] different things and we've still never
[1:13:13] come to the real kernel. It's Jesus
[1:13:16] Christ, the love of God that God wants
[1:13:20] us to see." What a pity. Love is the
[1:13:22] greatest and the most powerful weapon
[1:13:25] that the world has ever seen or known
[1:13:28] of. It's dying for love. The church is
[1:13:32] perishing for love. the love of God's
[1:13:35] waters of grace to flow one to another
[1:13:38] when confidence is restored, when
[1:13:39] justice is restored between us. The love
[1:13:41] of God that shed abroad in our hearts.
[1:13:44] He says uh uh it
[1:13:48] says love of God shed abroad in our
[1:13:49] hearts by denomination. He goes
[1:13:51] something sounds sounded wrong there,
[1:13:52] didn't it? The love of God is shed
[1:13:54] abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:59] Another place he said he was just a man,
[1:14:00] the perfect man. He gave us life. He
[1:14:02] made an example for you. Now uh now what
[1:14:06] must we do? The first thing I want to
[1:14:07] say is he never lived for himself. His
[1:14:09] life was spent for others. That's
[1:14:12] perfectly eternal life. When you say you
[1:14:14] go to church and you and and you do good
[1:14:16] things, that's fine. But when you live
[1:14:19] your life to yourself, you don't have
[1:14:21] eternal life. Eternal life is living for
[1:14:24] others. It proved it when he come in the
[1:14:27] lamb of God. He lived and had eternal
[1:14:30] life because he did not live for
[1:14:32] himself. He lived for others. And when
[1:14:34] you receive eternal life by receiving
[1:14:37] that day, you don't live for yourself no
[1:14:40] more. You live
[1:14:43] for others.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:50] carriers of life,
[1:14:53] the blood cell of God
[1:14:57] in our hearts
[1:15:00] that's been broken by the DNA of God.
[1:15:03] The life of God has come in.
[1:15:06] Amen.
[1:15:07] And has ignited those dramatized those
[1:15:11] seeds.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Now mercy is for us. Can you say amen?
[1:15:17] Matthew 5:38,
[1:15:19] "You have heard it been said, an eye for
[1:15:22] an eye, a tooth for a tooth. But I say
[1:15:26] in you, I say unto you, that ye resist
[1:15:29] not evil.
[1:15:31] But whosoever smite thee on the right
[1:15:33] cheek, turn to him the other also. If
[1:15:36] any man sue thee at law, and take away
[1:15:39] thy coat, give him your cloak also.
[1:15:42] Whosoever compel thee to go a mile, go
[1:15:46] with him, too.
[1:15:48] Give to him that askketh thee, and from
[1:15:50] him that would borrow of thee, and turn
[1:15:53] not away.
[1:15:55] You have heard, and it's been said, thou
[1:15:58] shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine
[1:15:59] enemy. But I say unto you, love your
[1:16:03] enemy, bless them that curse you, do
[1:16:06] good to them that hate you, pray for
[1:16:09] them which despise, despitefully use you
[1:16:12] and persecute you. Can you say amen? The
[1:16:15] Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 4:7, he
[1:16:19] gives he gives the secret, but we have
[1:16:24] this treasure.
[1:16:27] Hallelujah. Put that number six back up
[1:16:29] there. We have this treasure in earthn
[1:16:33] vessels.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That the excellency slide number six
[1:16:37] that the excellency of the power
[1:16:41] may be
[1:16:43] of God and not of us. We are troubled on
[1:16:48] every side yet not distressed. We are
[1:16:50] perplexed but not in despair. Persecuted
[1:16:53] but not forsaken. Cast down but not
[1:16:56] destroyed. always bearing about in the
[1:16:59] body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
[1:17:03] the life
[1:17:05] also
[1:17:06] of Jesus might be made manifest in our
[1:17:12] body. That's that's scripture. Amen.
[1:17:16] That the life also
[1:17:19] of Jesus might be made manifest
[1:17:23] in our body.
[1:17:26] You love him.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; So, as we go to work this week or we go
[1:17:31] and raise our families,
[1:17:34] let's keep the gospel simple.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Let's keep it simple.
[1:17:40] God, I want your life living in me.
[1:17:43] and anything that would try to come
[1:17:47] as a wedge between my love for God and
[1:17:50] my wedge as a my love for my family, my
[1:17:53] wife, my husband, my children.
[1:17:57] If there's even my enemies, if I begin
[1:18:00] to hate my enemies, God forgive me and
[1:18:03] help me. Let me have grace to love. I
[1:18:09] want to express that image.
[1:18:13] How many believe that's a good idea?
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:19] Hallelujah.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the musicians would come,
[1:18:26] aren't you glad
[1:18:28] that the life,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; eternal life
[1:18:33] expressed in you,
[1:18:36] Amen.
[1:18:38] If you don't enter into the fellowship,
[1:18:41] if something in you doesn't cry out for
[1:18:43] each other, if something doesn't project
[1:18:46] love, you know, people aren't so foolish
[1:18:49] as they understand whether you're
[1:18:50] putting on or not. They understand it.
[1:18:54] Wildlife understands it. You have to
[1:18:57] enter
[1:18:58] into that fellowship.
[1:19:02] But I just want to tell you,
[1:19:06] I'm so glad
[1:19:08] that Jesus didn't just declare it to his
[1:19:10] brethren, but he come and lived in the
[1:19:13] midst of his brethren. He's declaring
[1:19:17] the praises through you.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; He's the anointing upon you where the
[1:19:26] glor Oh my goodness. Oh, if we could
[1:19:29] just see it.
[1:19:32] his glory, his love.
[1:19:37] Oh hallelujah.
[1:19:40] Flow through me, Holy Spirit. You know
[1:19:42] that song. Flow through me,
[1:19:48] Holy
[1:19:50] Spirit.
[1:19:52] Flow
[1:19:54] through me.
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:20:00] flow through.
[1:20:05] Holy
[1:20:07] Spirit
[1:20:10] flow through me
[1:20:17] as I
[1:20:22] hand
[1:20:24] to worship
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; and to magnify
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:32] the name.
[1:20:34] Lord through me.
[1:20:39] Holy
[1:20:40] Spirit.
[1:20:46] Does Christianity just become
[1:20:49] a duty to you?
[1:20:52] Do you come to church cuz it's a duty?
[1:20:56] Or do we come
[1:21:01] to come into his presence?
[1:21:05] We come to enter into his presence to
[1:21:07] seek to remove every obstacle out of our
[1:21:10] way to
[1:21:14] know his presence is touching me.
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:20] Is our prayer life out of duty? Or is it
[1:21:24] because we want to
[1:21:27] come in contact with that great glorious
[1:21:29] God?
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:35] It's not duty.
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:38] It becomes your duty because as you come
[1:21:40] before him, then you understand there's
[1:21:42] some things that must be put at first.
[1:21:45] Churches should be the utmost
[1:21:46] importance.
[1:21:48] And when we come,
[1:21:50] Eman, our our desire is is to fellowship
[1:21:54] with God. And we're just going to make
[1:21:55] sure that we're ready.
[1:22:00] We're a living body. It's our It's our
[1:22:03] desire. It's our It's our call.
[1:22:08] It's who we are.
[1:22:12] Do we tolerate one another as a duty or
[1:22:15] do we
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:20] Do we genuinely love one another?
[1:22:24] Because duty can only go so far. And
[1:22:26] after a while, you get burned out and
[1:22:27] you say, "Okay, this is it. I'm
[1:22:29] finished. This is done."
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:35] But when there's a genuiness of God
[1:22:38] that we come into that realization
[1:22:41] that I'm a part of a something eternal,
[1:22:44] you're a part of something eternal.
[1:22:49] And I need you and you need me.
[1:22:53] And I'm not going to let any devil
[1:22:56] separate us. I'm not going to let
[1:22:59] anything come in between me and you. And
[1:23:02] our God
[1:23:04] has
[1:23:07] placed us in baptized into us into his
[1:23:10] body by one spirit that great eternal
[1:23:13] logos
[1:23:15] that great eternal holy spirit upon us.
[1:23:19] I want then it be does become a duty. I
[1:23:23] then you become my duty. I I don't want
[1:23:25] no devil coming against you. I don't
[1:23:27] want no devil. No no no no no no. Then
[1:23:30] there's a living force. Oh God, I want
[1:23:34] that. God, let me so baptize me again.
[1:23:38] Let your Holy Spirit renew me. Renew me.
[1:23:42] Oh, there's one filling and many
[1:23:45] refillings. We we we we need that
[1:23:48] refilling of his Holy Spirit.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah.
[1:23:54] Can Can you say amen to where it's just
[1:23:57] God? I want to be that reflection.
[1:24:00] Let me be that reflection. Let me be
[1:24:03] that reflection.
[1:24:05] Oh, not to just have the duty of being a
[1:24:08] preacher, a pastor, a a a a husband, a
[1:24:12] father, but oh, let me be a reflection
[1:24:16] of your glory right here. You You've
[1:24:20] called me to res. You've restored me.
[1:24:23] You brought many sons under glory,
[1:24:25] bringing many sons back into that
[1:24:27] relationship.
[1:24:29] Let it be in me. Let it be. Satan, you
[1:24:33] tried to take one of my one of my
[1:24:37] brothers or sisters and you're going to
[1:24:38] have to deal with me.
[1:24:41] Amen. You're going to have to deal with
[1:24:43] me. I'm going to pray. I'm going to do
[1:24:45] what it takes.
[1:24:47] Satan, you try to take me away and numb
[1:24:50] my mind and my heart
[1:24:54] from the realities of Jesus.
[1:24:58] I'm going to say Satan, not anymore. Not
[1:25:01] anymore.
[1:25:03] He's come to redeem me. I'm not looking
[1:25:06] at myself anymore. I I'm going to look
[1:25:08] at the grace of God and say, "God, help
[1:25:11] me." Oh,
[1:25:15] I'm going to look for somebody. Somebody
[1:25:18] the grace of God live through me, flow
[1:25:21] through me, manifest through me.

[1:38:59] I love you.
[1:39:03] for you
[1:39:05] are mine.
[1:39:09] Yes, Jesus, I love you
[1:39:14] for you are
[1:39:17] divine.
[1:39:22] I love you
[1:39:25] forever.
[1:39:28] It's true.
[1:39:33] You are Jesus
[1:39:37] who died
[1:39:40] for me. Oh, we got to sing it again.
[1:39:44] Oh, I love you
[1:39:48] for you
[1:39:51] are mine.
[1:39:53] Yes, Jesus.
[1:39:56] I love you
[1:39:59] for you.
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:07] I love you
[1:40:11] forever.
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:19] You are Jesus.
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:40:28] Now, if you want to keep this presence,
[1:40:32] see, God doesn't want us to be renewed
[1:40:35] and then we're on top of the mountain
[1:40:37] for three weeks, four weeks, and then go
[1:40:39] back down in the valley and stay there
[1:40:42] again. We feel good. We're loving
[1:40:44] everybody, and then we go back down, and
[1:40:46] then we're all hating everybody. God
[1:40:48] wants his Holy Spirit to bring us out of
[1:40:50] this thing. And let's walk with him. Did
[1:40:54] you know that's part of being worthy of
[1:40:56] the call? If you would look that up
[1:40:58] there, Sister Clea, just real quick as
[1:41:00] we dismiss Ephesians 4 and one, and read
[1:41:04] re look at this here. He says, I beseech
[1:41:06] you, brethren, uh it says, "Therefore,
[1:41:09] the the prisoner of the Lord, I
[1:41:11] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:41:13] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:41:17] vocation." That word vocation, amen, is
[1:41:20] God's invitation to embrace. Amen. So he
[1:41:25] says, I beseech you to walk worthy of
[1:41:27] the invitation to embrace salvation
[1:41:30] wherewith you are called
[1:41:33] with all loneliness and meekness, with
[1:41:36] long suffering, forbearing one another
[1:41:39] in love,
[1:41:41] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:41:43] spirit in the bond of peace. Now, now
[1:41:46] this is this is this is he says now
[1:41:49] you've got to walk worthy. If God has
[1:41:51] called you and you love his presence and
[1:41:54] you love what he's doing for you,
[1:41:57] then you've got to walk worthy of that
[1:41:59] call.
[1:42:01] You can't continue this other route.
[1:42:05] He's inviting you into this
[1:42:07] reconciliation.
[1:42:09] So remember, it's an honor that God's
[1:42:12] called us and invited us into. It's a
[1:42:15] great honor. Amen. God bless you. I love
[1:42:19] every one of you.
[1:42:21] Amen.
[1:42:23] I love him with all of my heart. And I
[1:42:26] love you with all of my heart. We pray
[1:42:28] for you every day. Believing God for
[1:42:32] great things for every one of you. Amen.
[1:42:35] Remember Sister Denise and and and
[1:42:38] Sister Angie as as both of them are
[1:42:41] sick. Let's just keep on praying for
[1:42:43] them. those that aren't here tonight.
[1:42:46] Amen. Just just reach out to them and
[1:42:48] let them know that you missed them.
[1:42:51] Amen. Praise the Lord. God richly richly
[1:42:54] bless you today.
[1:42:57] I love this feeling. I love the presence
[1:43:00] of God.
[1:43:01] I want it to go home with me. I want it
[1:43:03] to be in my home. I want it to be on the
[1:43:06] job. I I want it to be with me wherever
[1:43:09] I go. You can take this presence with
[1:43:11] you now. It's not just for here.
[1:43:15] You carry the anointing. You're the son
[1:43:18] of God. It is Jesus
[1:43:22] who died. God bless you. As you're
[1:43:25] dismissed, you dismiss yourselves.
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:29] Oh, I love him
[1:43:34] for he
[1:43:36] is mine.
[1:43:42] I remember this the the sister Brianna
[1:43:46] and and uh brother
[1:43:50] Robert as they are leaving out tomorrow.
[1:43:53] Brother Williams on his way to come and
[1:43:55] pick them up. He and Sister Sharon and
[1:43:57] then they're going to be traveling to
[1:43:58] the Carolas to be with the family. So
[1:44:01] let's let's let's keep Briana, Sharon,
[1:44:05] and a word. Uh all all that whole
[1:44:08] family, Esther, the boys. Let's just
[1:44:11] pray for that whole family.
[1:44:14] Oh, I love him
[1:44:19] for he
[1:44:21] is mine.
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:27] I love him
[1:44:30] for he is
[1:44:33] divine.
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:38] I love him
[1:44:41] forever.
[1:44:45] It's true.
[1:44:49] He is Jesus
[1:44:53] who died.
