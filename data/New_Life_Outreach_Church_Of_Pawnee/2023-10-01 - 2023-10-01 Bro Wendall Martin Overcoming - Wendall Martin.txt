here on Earth and then we go home and we get to enjoy what we were truly created for Amen to love him without any restriction that's what he created you for to love you without any loving without any kind of restriction can you say man amen and that's what we are here today to do we're we're overcoming all of the obstacles of of this world and were rising to the occasion amen now I um if you have your Bibles we'll read here in the Book of Revelations the third chapter I gave my voice a a week's rest and and uh just singing those songs as already uh got it got it peaked again and so uh you just have to put up with me a little bit amen and um we did we joined sister khalila and the boys there and and um in Colorado for a few days and they're still they're still going this morning over there but the boys had a had some Monumental birthdays 18 and 16 years old and and so we we sure enjoyed the time of rest it was well needed rest we needed that and really enjoyed the uh our time there and gave my voice a little bit of time to uh to recoup for a minute amen so hopefully we can make it through this service here this morning but um let's look here at Glacier or Revelations 3 and uh the 14th verse and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou work cold or hot and so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth and because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white arraignment uh that thou mayest be be clothed in the thighs that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I sound that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten bezalius therefore and repent Amen brother Bradham says the Zeal of the age is what repentance behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcomes somebody say I'm an overcomer will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I am overcome and I'm set down with my father in his throne and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I'd also like to go back to the 12th verse amen he that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you today for the many blessings that you have given us thank you for your love that is unfaltering and shaking thank you for the amazing words of life that you have brought to us in this age Lord I'm asking that you would help us this morning as we think about a simple topic on Overcomers then I'm asking Lord that you would help me to speak I'm asking Lord that you would help the hearers Lift us all up into your anointing this morning now Lord I I need some strength in my voice and I know that Lord if you just help me to relax and enter into your anointing then all things will be okay we thank you for it Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen how many is glad you're a believer how many Believers are in the house here this morning Hallelujah Believers amen we're not Believers in some kind of a TV thing but we're Believers in the unadulterated word of God amen now when we think about Overcomers I want to speak for just a a few moments this morning on Overcomers there are are three groups in the Bible amen now there's and you've got to rightly divide the word of Truth so in the Bible there are three groups there is Israel there is the church and then there are the Gentiles or the Nations amen that's the in in the Bible when you're when you're dealing with uh when you're dealing with prophecy throughout the entire Bible it's dealing with three different groups of people amen there are there are Israel there is uh uh the church and there is and then there is the Gentiles are the Gentiles or the Nations now a woman a woman is is a type it's a a metaphoric or a symbol of the bride of Christ and so amen when God is wanting to deal with the church he always deals with her as a woman amen and so when he dealt with Israel God God uh was a was a husband Jehovah was a husband unto uh uh Israel amen the natural Israel and so we we he talked with her as if she was his bride in the New Testament Church amen we find that there are are three there are three women that are are described in in the New Testament there is the bride who is the wise virgins there is the church who are the foolish virgins amen and then there is the the and the harlots Satan bride or Satan Babylon Satan's kingdom and so there are three women in the New Testament amen this New Testament Church that all comprise they're all religious they they all go to church they all use the same Bibles but only the Overcomers only the bride will overcome the spirit of the age in the age of incredible uh adulteries and and the age of incredible uh fornications and and sex sins that are that that are in this world today amen it is also carried over into the church until God Jesus says they're in in the Book of Revelations Jesus said that this woman would be a there would be a prostitute woman she would be amen the Great and she would have daughters who would be harlots amen and so we we find this that there are the wise there are the foolish and the there are those that are a man just in in adultery now we understand that this is a spiritual it's a metaphor it's not like the the church is going to uh or or you know that that you know someone says well you know uh uh you're claiming to be the bride and you're a man amen it is it is a category or it is a metaphor that God is used for his people amen that we all comprise of the Bride of Jesus Christ in other words we are coming under his authority under his headship can you say man so so adultery brother Bradham taught us that adultery happens a long time before the physical act it was uh uh uh Eve had already fallen Eve had already sinned when she took the words of the serpent into the womb of her spirit and then did she give herself away unto that beast and committed adultery now brother Branham says this he says now she is a type talking about the woman a type of all things vulgar and foul and Lonesome on the on the one hand on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptacles of the spirit and blessings of God on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other hand she is called the bride of Christ on the one hand she is Mystery Babylon the Abomination before God on the other hand she is called New Jerusalem our mother on the other hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is summarily cast into the Lake of Fire as only fit as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as only as the only place befitting such a queen can you say Amen now so so we can see that that that these these women amen when I again once again the the terminology used for amen it's it's natural meaning is to commit fornication or adultery it is someone that is willing to set aside their morals amen it means to be sexually indiscriminate to break the vows with her husband amen so you say how can this apply to the church how can this dirty filthy woman this prostitute amen even be in the same category of as the church but we find out that it is very true it's a woman that is not living true to her husband and his word amen so this this is something that uh in other words there's going to be a spirit in this age that is going to be there to lure God's people out and away from God's word amen and so I I want us to look at that this morning for a few moments there are spirits out there to lure you away from the oath that you gave unto the Lord Jesus Christ amen now now once again brother Bradham would say amen that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the Mind take in uh take in a lie of the devil against the word of God that's exactly what Eva done now I want us to think about that when we take anything contrary to our husband God the Lord Jesus Christ we take anything contrary to his word into our spirit we are in effect committing adultery against God now I want you to really think about that here this morning amen because just because you're sitting in a in a message church but yet you're petting spirits that God does not condone you you you you allow things in your mind take uh attitudes or Spirits or anything into your mind and into your heart you are effectively Hallelujah now now you might be all Pious and looking at somebody else and saying oh oh I know there's something there amen but what about your very your soul and keeping that Soul true to the one that you say is your lord amen now I I think this is this is something that we should amen keep in our our hearts as we go this morning because the elect of the age only the elect is going to overcome the spirits of this age now I've got some news for you here this morning amen because brother Branham says the only way that he could even uh have a believer in this age is to predestinate it so the only way that there's going to be an overcomer in this age the only way we would ever have a chance in this age is God predestinated a group of people to overcome in this age well that should make you want to shout right now amen he says it's by his Believers that he proves his word by he says he can only prove his word not by the unbelievers it's only by the Believers that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh I believe brother see if you do God will prove it so oh cause we look and we see the others how can we say then see it's it's by the True Believers that God proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word so when we stand upon that word hallelujah I'm going to believe God I believe a Christian is going to line everything in their belief system up with this word do you know that's the reason why amen that God put a but put the man is the head of the house is because the scripture says that the woman is the weaker vessel and and that the woman can imagine she can run by her emotions and she can think that she knows exactly what is going on when she doesn't at all amen and she can she can she can be led astray and you are to have your husband there to be your leader and to your god what can I you're an amen sisters amen we've got our husbands there to be our I know where that's this this this this don't go over too well in this generation but we have a head in the home and it's not the woman's spirituality it's not the woman's amen into an issue it's not the woman's thoughts and and her attitudes and amen there's only one head in the home and that is your husband now as the Bride of Jesus Christ then we come under the headship of Jesus Christ that puts me right in the same category amen I'm a bride member brother Donald you're a bride member amen Lanae you're a bride we are all a part of that and our headship is Jesus Christ the word how spiritual you are it's not how well you think it should be it's the way God says it would be Hallelujah now amen now don't y'all don't don't quit smiling at me now amen some of you sisters have already lost the victory this morning hallelujah amen you might get Bob with telling your husband how to eat the cabbage at home but you ain't gonna get by with her from God and I'll just bring you another one if you're going to be over there you had better overcome in your position here so if you're what you do to your husband here is what God's looking as being done to him there he gave the headship of the word to you here so if you're under the headship of the word you're going to submit to your husband well praise the Lord and you're not going to go around causing trouble and lie amen you're gonna you're gonna line it up with the word of God husbands I think it's time to line our our houses up to the word of God I think we ought to be Overcomers in this generation man we've got to be spiritual we've got to take these things into effect and say all right my home is not a guess-up or a gossip session amen it's not a it's not a trash dump where all of the gossip goes on if I don't know what I'm talking about I'm going to shut up and honey you are too Standing Ovation please honey I need me a sign I need me a sign up there when to clap Hallelujah you see now God is expecting the same from his pride God's got a cause for you to be here on this Earth and that's to destroy the enemy now what brings in brings in the uh uh uh uh you know the the the the malice or the you know the the discontentment between husband and wife and what brings in what causes what causes a woman a man to belittle or to minimize her husband's words you see I I say that it is a spirit there are spirits on the earth to try to come in and dismantle a man at the nuclear family trying to dismantle the headship because if you can remove the headship then you will remove amen the power that is to flow through that family so there are demons at play these demons are there to try to get you ladies to look somewhere else instead of to your husband well glory to God I I I want to tell you right now amen your husband is the head over you not your pastor Pastor is not the head of the family your husband is the head of the family can you say Amen there's nowhere in there in there that says you're high or your pastor is to override your husband your husband is the he is the man the buck stops right there it is Hallelujah you say well what are you doing Amen brother Wendell I am here to Simply help punch you to the right direction teach you men how to lead teach you ladies how to follow and then lead your children we are here with a purpose and that is to defeat the enemy [Applause] well praise the lord we have glory to God Amen now now now Satan came in and tried to tell Eve she was wiser than Adam Hallelujah now when Satan came in Amen brother Branham says he got her away that means this didn't just happen this didn't just happen overnight but Satan was was was was was pulling on her getting her away from her husband and then he dropped amen the bomb and then all of a sudden we find ourselves six thousand years later in these Fallen decayed bodies all because a woman felt she knew better than her husband this ain't on my notes but Hallelujah here we are amen she thought she knew better than her husband can you say Amen and now here he's fine we find ourselves a man in this broken condition now here she was put there she was put in a city where she was put in the walls of God's word now yes the Garden of Eden was beautiful and it was perfect and it was Serene and it was everything but there was nothing there was no walls around that uh around that Garden there was there was nothing there amen that could that would keep the devil out God simply gave him gave them his word his word was stronger than any gate his word was stronger than any wall his word was Stronger Hallelujah he gave them his word and as long as they stayed behind the word they were Overcomers as long as they stayed behind the word the Devil Himself had no control over their lives Hallelujah that devil might have been in that Garden for several days he might have been scheming for several days but as long as she was behind that work as long as she was standing there with the well come on church and I want to tell you it doesn't matter what the devil says he can yak his Jaws all he wants to but as long as you're standing behind the word of God you are safe you are secure amen the presence of God is with you the word of God is flowing through you you are under his headship and Satan has to answer to him he'll praise the Lord amen now so we find that the word of God a man was overlooked so brother Branham taught us that the adultery took place a long time before the physical act took place because there was a man there was a a lowering of the word there was a lower there was a coming out from behind the protection and listening to the spirits that she had no business listening to oh I could preach right now amen what what what business do we have walking out the side outside of that word and listening to things that we don't have a business listening to entertaining thoughts that we don't have a business center to what can you say Amen you see we the reason why we're loose lips is because our Spirits are already there our Spirits are already outside the word and you can't train those lips to talk right when your spirit is already there and it's feeding on the junk of the devil feeding on the junk of the devil you can't help but amen live a life that that where that comes about but if you stand behind the word of God there is where the Overcomer is there is where you bring every thought in line with the word of God well praise the Lord here's where when the enemy is hitting you every which direction and pulling this way and pulling that way you're standing there upon thus saithful Lord you're not going to commit adultery against against the word against what Christ has given you you're going to keep your mind your thoughts your words your actions everything upon thus saith the Lord and you have been ordained of God to do so now he says it's only by True Believers that he proves his word of those who say they believe well you can play music in the church and be the biggest hypocrite there is you can be a preacher in the church and be the biggest devil there is but it's those who line their thoughts prayer Glory to God the Bible says gird up the loins of your mind why what what loins loins isn't that the reproductive part of a man what what is what is mind and loins there's where you have your babies right here there's where the Devil comes in and starts planting his seeds right here there's where the enemy comes in and before you know it you're looking at that sister saying uh yeah I've seen the way she she acted and before you know it Satan's got this big old thing Hallelujah it ain't a bit true but you believe it and you're getting everyone else to believe it because you are outside the protection of that word well glory to God before you know what you've got all you're all laid up you're all laid up you're ate up from the amen the top of your head to the bottom of your feet yet you're still coming to church amen with your hands lifted up as you know you ain't got Victory you know the enemy's coming against you but God is saying there's going to be somebody who's going to fight against those devils and overcome Hallelujah man there ain't nothing there ain't nothing like a like a cat I'm letting that cat out and before you know every time you don't you think you I you just you just think that and that cat has comes back and she's pregnant and she's got babies and amen you've still got that litter and before you know it she's pregnant again and you ain't got rid of those kittens yet and amen and you're starting to starting to love the cats and and and you know who cares that your house stinks and everything else stinks you know when they're they're they're they're they're peeing all over everything spraying everything and scratching your car all up amen before you know it they've got another one another litter coming and another litter coming and can you say Amen brother Wendell I just don't know how I got this way I just don't know how I just don't know where this came from I know you left the cap out of the house well praise the Lord I'd say we need to take the cat down and Spade them or whatever that thing's called amen get that thing get that thing all taken well Hallelujah I'm so it's something that is done on purpose it's not something that's going to happen by accident there is something on the genetics on the inside of a daughter and a son of God that is going to overcome the muck of this world Hallelujah well come on now amen now now some of you are still hung up on the cats amen I've had cats Hallelujah they're good for target practice no that's not that's not true amen I've had cats we've you know I've you love cats that's wonderful amen but cats are some of the most dumbest animals you can't ever train them to do anything and I want to tell you that's what the enemy wants to do to you he wants to get you out there let that mind go out there and just roam everywhere and you come back and impregnated with thoughts of the enemy amen that the enemy wants to come in he wants to try and then he brings those babies back home and all their cooking cute and cuddly hey man but I'm here to tell you God's got something more for you than just amen let your thoughts go wild and come to church occasionally God has ordained you to rise and to overcome your enemies Hallelujah amen somebody's going to have to do it now now brother Brandon was I'm fixing to tell to read the rest of this story on these Believers now he says the old crop had to die off because every time they turn around God done some things spectacular God God God heal him God God gave him water at the Red Sea God damn I mean God done all of these things and yep the enemy kept coming in and breeding junk in their hearts and their minds and brother Branham says now he has to have Believers the old crop has died off them believers who said we can't take it he let every one of them perish every one of them but to the Believers who was left Moses had been taken to Glory the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and now was their children there were only two that crossed over and that was the Believers Joshua and Caleb they was the Believers they was the ones who crossed over it's only the way it's the only way God can do it is by his believing children you believe that all right his Believers were the ones that done it he used them to cross over with now I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take Believers and then in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age do you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be here to meet the challenge of the age he says did you get it did you feel it did you see it do you understand it now he's really want you to understand this now that's what is happening today he's predestinated it to this by his poor knowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinated anything to happen in his word he has to prove it to me so and when he predestinates anything to happen and says it'll happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he's predestinated a bride someone say hallelujah she's going to be there going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestininated by his foreknowledge there's nothing going to stop it you say well then why are you breaking if we're predestinated if we're predestinated and nothing's going to stop it why are we here okay you see God's not going to do your overcoming for you you're still mortal you're still human and you've still got a mind that Satan loves to try to get to hell I'm preaching better than your amen and right now Hallelujah you are still a human being and Satan knows how to play the system but on the inside of you Hallelujah I used to tell the boys and I it was just something that I always thought that I told the boys when they were growing up I said you're either going to be in a factory the rest of your life you're you're either going you're going you're going to have to answer to somebody the rest of your life now this might not be good advice brother Merle would probably say bad bad bad advice amen because he now because now he's he's he's he's just retired he's got all those big bucks still coming in amen well brother brother brother I I I I I I said you but God and there's got to be there's got to be the givers and the takers there's got to be those that are punching the time clock there's got to be but God has ordained you to rule I told him there's nothing wrong with working at McDonald's there's nothing wrong with working over there but I'm here to tell you amen I'm looking at some contractors in the future I'm looking at some people that can that can feed other people I'm looking I I I say I say you can own your own business you can do your own well praise the Lord now my day was there was that amen my wife says yeah what how what good did that do you we're broke amen hallelujah but my mentality was this God has created you God has given you that ability within that Soul To Rule and to reign and if you can ever get that connected together amen God will give that wisdom God will rise above and I'm just wanting to you put that in this in in this terms here this morning there is going to be the church as a whole amen that's just going through the round of the meal amen but there's going to be some Overcomers that's going to stand out and say listen I am ordained I am equipped I have been placed here with a specific purpose in mind no it don't always work out in the natural but in the spiritual God's calling for men and women to rise to the occasion and defeat the enemy in this natural world you say well there can only be just a few contractors there can only be just a few you know doctors there can only be just a few and you might look at yourself and say man I'm on the low end of the totem po here but in the spiritual realm every one of us have been placed on this Earth To Rule and have dominion tired amen so I'm not satisfied coming in amen I'm putting my little time clock in in church and say I'm doing what I need to do for right now and amen and I'm just putting in my duty I got to thinking this morning on the way to church it was just it was just the silliest thought as I'm as I'm driving down the road and I'm fine why what what why do people come to church in the first place you know what do people come every Sunday morning and Sunday night and every Wednesday night I mean really why because I was looking what it was I drove down the road you're saying boy get back on your notes amen I was I was going down the road and I passed all of I passed Church alley and I'm seeing these these guys get out of the church you know and and and out of the cars and and you know and then when they're getting out I mean they're they're they're coming in their you know blue jean shorts and ball caps and they're all they're all walking in and I'm and I'm looking at this as I'm driving by and I'm thinking why why do why do people come to church and I and and and and and as I'm going down and I see this church and I see the other church and I and and I'm looking and I and and and and and and of course I know that I'm preaching on overcoming here today and I got to thinking God don't let me be the run of the meal don't let me well I don't know what's bringing those guys to the church in fact when I looked up the study uh here a couple months ago we found out that that they're trying to figure out how to get the people back in the church because they can't keep them in the church amen and it's and it's become a a a a a a a a big a big deal that the denominations are talking about right now amen with all the online church services and things and I got to think God why am I going to church why am I walking in the why I'm asking myself as I'm driving on the road why am I doing it because that's my job am I doing it because people are depending on me am I coming to church this morning because amen it's something that probably should be done you heard the the story a man of the of the woman that comes into her husband Sunday morning says you need to you need to get up it's about time to get ready I'm gonna I'm gonna feed you breakfast and go to church and she comes back in and he's not he he's he's not right you know rousing around and finally after the third or fourth time amen the man looks at that woman and says give me one good reason why I need to be going to church this morning she says I'll give you two your children are out there and you need to be a good example but number one is you're the pastor and you need to be at church this morning praise the Lord now God doesn't want just average people God is looking for Overcomers and the seed has already been placed right here the genetics are already in your heart and when you try to be just the average Sam amen you find out that that that you just can't be the average guy why because the seed of eternal life is on the inside of you those are doing their thing they're doing their part they're making their preachers happy or their wives happy or their children but you have something that has already been predestinated before the foundation of the world you are just like the eagle in the chicken pen chickens are content with collecting in a bin egos never are satisfied being EarthBound therefore something's on the inside of you saying I must get out of this prison house I must get out of this chicken yard I'm not there must be something more you have been predestinated to this age oh man that should make us all want to shout you're not a chicken Hallelujah you're an eagle Hallelujah amen amen and Eagles I know there might be some chicken lovers in here and I sure thank the Lord for the salvadones they keep us in stock with chicken eggs we sure love them but Eagles eat chickens Hallelujah now you you just you just you just take that up with God hallelujah amen eagles eat chickens that's that's what Eagles do so chickens they might they might they might have their nice pretty little red rooster uh you know uh whatever and and the beard and they're crawling around but you see he's just a chicken but there is an eagle that has been rise lifted up above it to overcome the society now this morning as I as as we look at the word of God I think we should all look into in our heart if you're not an overcomer by heart then you'll never be an overcomer but if there is something on the inside of you that is an overcomer at heart I want to tell you God's given you everything to overcome by and I don't care what the enemy is doing I don't care how much you feel like you're a loser right now if there's something in God's equipped you to overcome in this age can you save my if there's something in that heart Oh Glory to God I'm going to resist the Temptations of the enemy I'm going to resist all amen of the of everything that Satan tries to pull in against me now brother Branham he would say now now what are we to overcome he says that is the normal question to ask here but this is not the thought of this verse the man where he's talking about to overcome he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I am overcome and set my father's throne he says for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome well if I had something easier to overcome then I could overcome it doesn't matter what there is to overcome you've overcome don't be looking at the guy across the aisle and say ah he's got a lot to overcome and you can look at their wife next to you and say huh she's got a lot to overcome it's easy for us to say oh man I can see what your problem is all right will you but to look in the heart and say Lord I've got some overcoming that I need to do come on now I'm going to tell you I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll tell you no no that does not take a gift of discernment they know they need to overcome but do you know that you need to overcome well Glory it's bad when you got Eagles in the chicken pen claiming that they're chickens that they're just fine it's bad when you got Eagles in the chicken pen acting like chickens content to be chickens just because they're bigger than all the other chickens and they're less looking around and saying I am the king of this barnyard that is not your purpose buddy you're an eagle you're not to compare yourself with chickens you're gonna rise above it come on Church rise above it so today is the question is not going to hold you long but the question is not how or or or or or or what I have to overcome but how I am to overcome he says now that is the lot that now this is logical for it does matter much what we uh what what we overcome but now this is logical for it does matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look at the scriptures he says which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition Matthew 4 when Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcome the personal Temptations of Satan by the word by the word only in each of the major three major trials that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word eve fail to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail now notice again how Jesus overcame the World Systems of religion when he repeatedly when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God in his own personal life contending with himself he overcome by The Obedience of the word Hebrews 5 and 7 says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication and strong crying and tears talking about Jesus unto him that was able to save him from death and was hurting that he feared and though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect someone shout hallelujah he become the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of God now then there will not be one person who will set in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living in that living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne it will be granted only to the word bride we've just got our separations there's three women in the church there is the wise virgin foolish virgin and then the Great Horror and the harlots there's only one who is going to be sitting in that throne this is what separates the women from the girls the men from the boys this is what separates is God's word taken to your heart number one and you lining up your thoughts your Ambitions your desires everything about you with that word he's our husband he's our Lord it's not what I think he's the one that invites me to his throne that he overcome and is seated in now I am overcoming and I'm going to set with him in the throne that he overcome with can you say Amen ah y'all ain't listening to me it will only be granted to the word bride and as the Throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is United to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that through you know what that does for me that that tells me there I I I it it makes me want to it makes me wanna uh quote that scripture there in in Hebrews 12 and 1. amen we're just talking about the great cloud of witnesses the Overcomers of all of the other ages who are already there waiting amen he says I'm being compassionate about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that would so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us you know what makes a winner a champion is born a champion is born a winner he couldn't win anything he couldn't be a champion over anything he couldn't do anything until he was trained but what makes a champion a champion is not just the training the champion is that it's it's got you've heard you you've heard the saying he's got the heart a champion that little something there might be somebody else that might be a better boxer there may be somebody else that could be a better Runner but there comes somebody that's got something already in their soul and they're saying I'm going for the gold I'm going for the gold and you're not going to keep that man down you're not going to keep that woman down and she's going to do what it takes if I praise the Lord amen as I'm fixing to close I remember back when I was in school learning learning the electrical and I was I was the only homeschooler that was going uh uh there at the at the electrical you know class and um you know I was a little awkward at that age and uh you know 7 16 17 years old and I was believe it or not has a little shy and um you know so we're trying to learn this electrical

your stinking drill bit this is what I had to put up with all right oh it was so embarrassing for me to walk in that classroom oh I hated it but something down on the inside of me kept saying I'm going to prove to these yahoos that I can do it I am going up and and they Unleashed a beast in me I love Olivia hmm so my instructor Mr Lee announces that competition is coming up it's going to be regionals and I'm thinking this is my chance so he says I'm going to select four out of the class we're going to have a competition here in the class there'll be four that'll go there'll be two from there there'll be two from the second year class and two from the first year class and they said who wants to who who wants to to try this and boy people's hands go man everyone's all turn around looking at me and Lester Mr leak he said what's your hand up for did you not understand what I'm saying I'm saying I said I understood what you're saying I want to be in the competition he says Wendell I said just let me try so everyone gets their paper so we go now this competition comes okay so man I'm I'm out there working and I'm I'm working hard and you know and everyone else is all done but I'm I'm I'm still but I know but I've still got time so I am working finally get my stuff done I get in and and so the the you know they uh uh you know sent us home and where they came out and inspect it but they did what they weren't going to tell who won what until and so uh that somehow for some reason I had to go back into the class and I and I heard and I heard Mr leak telling one of the other officials they said you know Wendell is Wendell is never going to make it but he tries so hard he says should I put him in that fourth slot and they said give the boy a chance he said Wendell's just you don't even know the difference between a wood pit an amazing bit and they argued back and forth and went back and forth and when I heard I'm going to give Wendell a chance I went back onto my dad and I said I'm in and I said I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to make you proud I'm going to make Mama Proud I'm going to make Kenwood proud and I am going to do this so I came back to school the next day and he was acting I'd already heard you know and he's acting like it yeah yeah and he says oh Wendell I'm going to let you just tag along and everyone's laughing and some of them feeling sorry for me oh you get to I went and took I got me a vendor I went home took I took all kinds of conduit at home I got my uglies book and I begin to bend pot I had a few months to get ready and I started bending pipe I started I got my calculations together I started putting those things in buddy we went to we went to the state Hallelujah we went to the state I am I am out there in this state competition there were there were several hundred people there was like uh I don't know 250 300 people and we're all in there all out there practicing uh and it might even been more than that might have been like uh five or six hundred people there's four from each uh from from each votech anyways we're all out there and and uh amen and I'm the last again I'm the very last in my my instructor is over there looking and I could I look back and he's over talking to some guys and some other guys I seen a little gleam in one of their eyes and they were they was like Lord let me let me beat this let me do this that that that uh we didn't know anything until the the next day and when they asked us on the state now we had hunt with all the families and everything there were thousands of people there Hallelujah in fourth place in third place and second place and I wasn't it and I thought well my instructors they were they were proud you know why because the guys who took fourth third and second came from his school my school and I could see Mr Lake said well at least we got three but then number one Wendell Martin I'm going you would think that number four number three number two would be all happy for number one they were not they weren't happy when I was on the stage and they weren't happy when we we rode together and they were so mad all were they mad and I'd use that time as my Victory lap I knew I could do it I told you I could do it I come on I had to offer I had to fight harder than everyone else but I did it I came back the second year it was a little bit different story now everyone was saying we're going to beat him if we're going to beat him I went back for the for the state competition the second year and I smoked them all so state champion once again it was it was a little boy that was so weary or so so scared and so timid and that's the reason I like all you young people I like I like I like to encouraging it to be everything that you can be don't you quit for anything you're a champ in heart before you're a champion in reality and you got to train for it and you've got to be ready for it and that's the reason why we gotta grow up this morning don't let the devil have his way don't let Satan do play his tricks with you you're a winner you're a champion you're predestinated and overcomer Hallelujah Hallelujah you're an overcomer sister Betty I know you've been fighting but you're an overcomer amen yes Overcomers what we've got to do is lay aside all the weights you're going to have to train harder than all of those guys out there that think they've got it all in the bag they don't have it all in the bag like they think they've got it in the back but there's somebody that can have it in the bag if you'll train for it if you'll prepare for it lose them failing falling that does not define who you are that does not define who you are how many times did Mr Ford go bankrupt seven how many times did did it take for the light bulb to finally work come on how many times inventors they they worked and they worked they looked like they were losers because something was inside of them that was in their soul it was in their genetics it was part of their heart it was who they were everyone else says go get a job there they are eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that's they they didn't care they didn't care what they had anything they were just going to sit there and Tinker tinker and try to come up with something everyone else had life but our inventions that we have today come from Men that were willing to take it from here and put their Vin their own paper from paper somewhere else to reality aren't you women glad that there's somebody invented a dishwasher and a washing machine you men were concerned you say I got one when I got married but these women were glad when a dishwasher was invented amen Overcomers were Overcomers you love him the musicians would come [Applause] he that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God he that overcometh he should go no more out in other words he's not torn by this and invites every everything comes around and or you know what you caught up in this and you're caught up in that and you're you're making righteous decisions you're looking at things the way God sees these things you're not trying to look at the way to figure things out for your own self you're seeing things the way God sees them and you're just coming in line with What God Says you say Lord I'm going to be a part of your program [Music] and as long as you're part of his program you're going to overcome you can resist the program if you want but you'll be a loser [Music] why not come in line [Music] with God in his program [Music] and by the way my instructor Lester Leake we have become lifelong Buddies he calls me occasionally checking on the boys he's all proud to hear the electrical contractors electricians and he tells me now I knew you had it in you I said yeah right he said I was just trying to bring it out of you all right we went to Nationals I didn't finish my story but we went to Nationals together Mr Lee and I stayed in the same room and he said well no you don't beat all foreign he started sharing his heart with me some of the circumstances in his family and things that nature and here I am at that time I'm a 17 year old kid [Music] and I said all I can say Mr Lee [Music] and I know that I'm born for a purpose and I believe that the law the more I can surrender myself to him [Music] I said so maybe this is his purpose for me for right now is to win a championship as well are you going to win this one this is National we're talking about competing against a whole bunch more than you did stay [Music] I want to give it everything I've got [Music] But ultimately he's the one [Music] we become Buddies [Music] now whether or not he's he was telling the truth that he always knew or not I I I still have a hard time believing that but in this case [Music] he wouldn't have given you this message he wouldn't have sent you a prophet he wouldn't have put that little something down on the inside of you saying I've got to win [Music] I don't care where you are today you wouldn't have that little something that says I've cut well [Music] he loves you he gave you his spirit [Music] and he's not looking at you saying I hope you win you twerp God's already seen the end God knows you're going to win [Music] I want people to believe in me to trust me But ultimately you can think what you want to think [Music] he knows he knows what he's doing in me he knows where I'm going he knows the work that he's performing in me he knows me he's created me he's made me who I am [Music] and I just want him to be pleased with me at the end of the day I want him to say I knew it knew he's going to make it happy destinated you to make it I've called you for this purpose the pressure gets hard sometimes I say why why why [Music] but he knows what he's doing he's preparing me for the he's preparing me for the gold he's preparing me [Music] therefore instead of fighting and resisting I simply see if this is what you think [Music] I want to be a part of The Winning Side make me a champion [Music] Jesus was a champion and he learned it by The Obedience Let Me Be A Champion let me follow your word you say man how many champions do we have in the building you see oh if I could just be a champion you are a champion [Music] you see what my instructor did not know and what no one else knew is I would walk into his office Brother John [Music] and the wall into his office the whole his whole wall land with gold medals [Music] over here land silver medals his entire office we're talking about metals like it's gold medals silver medals bronze medals lined up all the way down to his desk all the way around and I would walk into that office [Music] I didn't feel like a champion I was being made fun of every day [Music] but I'd look at those gold medals sometimes he'd walk in and he'd say we done in my office just cleaning [Music] Joe I'd say I want to be that I want one of those [Music] and though he was pretty rough we all knew the state of Oklahoma knew that he produced The Champions and though he didn't see a champion in me there was something in me saying I want to be that is there somebody here tonight this morning any of you kids any of you adults who want to say I want to be a champion champion of love he was the champion of love I want to be that kind of a champion [Music] if this me and mine [Music] I want the glory of the Lord to be so satisfied with me Teach Me teach me how to redeem teach me how to live teach me how to walk above reproach teach me how to live the way you live teach me please [Music] when Lester started seeing me now it was a different story when I was around everybody else he would he would continue making fun of me but he what no one else knew is he was providing me with all of the conduit and he was providing me with all the literature and on that and in that when was preparing for the state he said well I like your drive son I want to teach you what I know and if you listen to me you might have a shot Oh Glory to God God sent us a prophet but if you listen to me I'll teach you how to win how to overcome [Music] pulling you off to himself saying come on come here you've got the potential in you man I'm looking at potential here today [Music] I'm looking at potential I'm not I I'm looking at Champions [Music] you might not have reached the gold yet [Music] but it's time to quit looking at this one and looking at that and looking at this it's time to get your eyes on your purpose here foreign God has placed the gold in your heart
