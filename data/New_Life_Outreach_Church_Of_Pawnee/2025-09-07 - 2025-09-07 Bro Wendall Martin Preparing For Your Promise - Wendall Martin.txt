[Music] You're all I want. Help me draw you. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. That's such a that was such a beautiful song that Alina sung being desperate for him. And I I I think until we really get that place where we we're so desperate for him, we've got to have him, we'll just always be mediocre. whether we it's not it's not anything that we have to have and I think that's that's what really that's our society is a is a as I've said times before our society is a drugged society where everyone's on drugs there's no there's no desperation for God you the whether they're drugged with with the regular drugs, and there's too many of them that are. They're living off of artificial stuff, but but we're also drugged with the with with with the uh the the pleasures of life, things that numb just anything to numb us from reality. And then we don't really we're not really desperate for reality. We're not we're not desperate to to fix things in our lives. Not desperate to see God in our lives. It just becomes something that is whether we have our victory or whether we don't. But I I believe God wants us to live in victory. &gt;&gt; God didn't call us to be drugged up. God didn't call us to to be, you know, so our our minds so taken up on the internet and social media and things that he's called us to live victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's going to be someone that's desperate for him saying, "You're all I want. &gt;&gt; You're of what I want." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we enjoyed that here tonight. Good to have brother Kobe back with us here this evening and missed him this morning. We um let's look here in the book of Ephesians the 2 chapter and um we won't keep you too long tonight where uh after the service uh I think there's going to be some that's going to be moving the pews getting getting them all ready to go for the for the meeting. And then I believe uh Sister Leah, I checked with her earlier. It it sounds uh that the ladies are going to meet down here at the church sometime tomorrow um uh to to give the the church a cleaning. And so um you all have probably got your own chats and things going. So um we appreciate everyone that's going to be helping on that. &gt;&gt; And then Wednesday um we're we're also uh we're going to dismiss the service here. So there's and then there's going to be a whole lot of work uh to be doing as ladies setting up the kitchen, bringing everything from the fellowship hall and and what have you. As guys, we've got refrigerators and stoves and and and things to move and as as well as um setting up CS and we've just got a we got a little bit to do there on on Wednesday. And um so uh we would so those who can come for uh for for any of this uh we would really appreciate your help. Hey, it's some sometimes it's better to have too much than not enough. Amen. We can get it done with we can always tell you to go home, but we if we need help and and don't have it than it so uh but um so we would appreciate that. looking forward to the meeting. Ephesians 2 and1 it it says um for you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses of sins. Now going back to what we mentioned this morning. Amen. Brother Brandham says in order to be quickened there had to be a seed in the ground. So, we're so thankful that there was something to quicken where in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the children which now workketh or or the the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past, and the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God who is rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; He's rich in mercy. He comes and brings us out of those things. He brought us out of sin. Brought us back to our right mind. Brings us in. God who is rich in mercy. For his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Aren't you glad you're in heavenly places in Christ Jesus? Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we do thank you for your your blessings. We appreciate your presence tonight, Lord. And we are desperate for you, Father. We want our hearts to be blended with yours. And Lord, we want to see the way you see and believe the way you believe, Father. And we're just asking God as we are going to be making preparations this week for these meetings. We just ask that you would be with every team, Lord, all of the teams that are working. And I just pray, Father, that you would you would be with them all and give them wisdom, skill, strength, Lord. And we just ask, Father, that everything would go smoothly. And Lord, I I I just pray that you would help us here this evening as as I minister. I ask Lord that you would lift us both, the speaker and the hearer, into your wonderful presence. Lord, we love you. In Jesus name we pray. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here this evening. not going to hold you long, but looking here at at the um at the scripture uh heavenly places and I I just thought for a title tonight, preparing for your promise, looking to these meetings, heavenly places is all things possible. Heavenly places, brother Brandham would describe it. He says, "Faith takes its position on the rock of God's word and all the waves of hell beating against it, its foundation. It'll take its eagle eye and soar beyond them clouds and see the God of resurrection uh of resurrection and promise." I'm so thankful for that tonight. And so I I'm glad that we can we can be in these heavenly places tonight. I'm glad that I can be here associated with you in heavenly places. Amen. He says he's made us all to sit together with Christ in heavenly places. Amen. That that's that's incredible to me because Christ was the only one Jesus was the only man that has ever been exalted to those heavenly places. But Jesus represents you. So when Jesus was exalted to the heavenly places, so were you exalted. We have a human being. We have a God man that is representing us in the heavens. Amen. He's conquered. He's in the heavenly places. And he's invited you and me to come in up into those heavenly places. Amen. What a place to be. What a place to be where you can escape this world. Amen. The doom and the gloom and to sat right there with your neighbor, your brother, your sister. Even tonight, right here in heavenly places. Amen. Heavenly places. That's where the promises are at. Heavenly places. This is where God, Amen, reveals himself. Heavenly places is where, Amen. you can grab a big old Amen. chunk of grapes from Canaan's land and be able to eat them and and believe God. How many believes that God still heals and delivers and sets free? Amen. Heavenly places, it's the it's the position or it's the perching place of faith. Amen. That's where that great eagle is. And Amen. He's above all of everything. And he can see the promises way out there. He can see the He can see the storms coming and prepare. He can he can he can rise up. I I I love going out to the lake and watching those eagles, you know, as they're just circling around the lake there and Amen. and before you know it, Amen. Uh or or a lot of them just set on those trees. There's there's several out there, but but you you'll see them just sitting on the trees and they're just watching and watching. Then before you know it, Amen. They're up and gone and they come back with a fish and and but what are they doing? They have they're they're they're above the waters. They're above the trees. They're above it all. And they're looking down for their prey, looking for their food. And I'm thankful that we can do that here tonight. Amen. You're above the hindrances of life. There's no obstructions to keep you from seeing heavenly places. You can dream and dream and dream. Amen. And there's nothing there to hinder you. All things are possible. Amen. Now, I've been around those who who who can't dream. Amen. I I I I've been around those that Amen. that uh uh live in a little bit different atmosphere. Amen. Because and and and quite honestly, I believe it's because they're not in the presence of God. They don't know how to walk in the presence of God. And and that's why, Amen. That's the reason why we have to go through all of these other things of life to try to numb our conscience because your soul desires to be with in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Desires to be in the presence of God. And Satan has got so many substitutes out there to keep you from his presence. Man, I I don't want to be living from fix to fix. I don't want to be Amen. just uh uh uh surfing the internet all the time just to keep my mind busy. God, let me be what you have called me to be. I want to fellowship with him just like God wants to fellowship with me. It's not that you want to you. It's not that you're begging God. God is begging you to take him at his word. He's invited us into those heavenly places. Can you say amen? Amen. But you see you those who can't quite dream. They're they're living in another atmosphere. And amen. It's a totally different atmosphere than those that are that are up in those higher places where their vision is totally different. Amen. Well, can you say amen? When you ask them, "What what do you what do you see? What are you looking at?" Ah, amen. They're looking at sickness and they're looking at bills and they're they're looking at troubles all around and and and they're mad at this one and they're mad at that one and amen and this one and the other. Oh my goodness. I don't want to live in that kind of an atmosphere. I want to live in those heavenly places where God called me to live. &gt;&gt; That's where Adam lived at the beginning. That's where God created man to live is in the presence of God. Who created you to live in his presence? Well, praise the Lord. You don't have to you don't have to wait for church time to come in his presence. You can live in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to come to church one once or twice or Amen three times a week just uh uh to to to feel the presence of God. I say that you can you can feel his presence right there. You can live in his presence. Oh, bless the name of the Lord. Adam longed. He lived in the presence of God. He He longed for it. He couldn't He couldn't awake. He anticipated for the presence of God. Every evening, God would come walking through the cool of the garden. And Adam and Eve waited. They could not wait. Oh, they enjoyed the garden and they enjoyed these other things. But I believe that Adam and Eve, they had an anticipation. Papa's going to be coming down any time. And we're going to get to fellowship with him. He's going to reveal himself to us a little bit more. And we're going to Well, can you say amen? Amen. And I believe that's the way our anticipation should be even. Amen. For our for for our services when we come. God, I I can't wait to come to church. I can't wait. Well, it shouldn't be. Well, well, I got a little bit of a cough. I better stay home. Don't want to get anyone sick. Amen. Well, oh man, I've got a backache. I Oh my. You're missing the whole point. Amen. If we are if we love him and we we fellowship with him and we Amen. and we know him the way he does, it's so wonderful when we can all gather together in heavenly places, believing for the supernatural things to come to pass in our lives. Well, can you say amen? Amen. That's right. Amen. You You see, Amen. when when those that that man that's in those heavenly places, you know, you when you look out, you're seeing things a little bit differently. Maybe you're going through something maybe even far worse, amen, than the other fella. Amen. But yet, because the Holy Spirit has quickened the faith in your heart and you're living in another environment, you are seeing something totally different. Why? Because you're walking alone with God. When you're walking with God, things are you you view things differently. When you're in his presence, you see things differently. You're living in a world alone with God. Oh, can you say amen? Amen. Now, for the other one, Amen. The other guy might might not be there and he can't see what you are seeing. Amen. But you see, and you're embracing healing. You can see and you are embracing victory. you can see and rejoicing with joy unspeakable. My God shall supply all of my needs according to his riches in glory. Can you say amen? Amen. What is it? It's not it's it's it's you're still living in this world and you've got the same problems, but there's one that is walking in faith and there's another that is walking by the way they feel, by the way they they see, by the way they hear. Oh God, let me stay in that heavenly place. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. That's right. You see? Amen. When these things come upon earth, the Bible says, "Lift up your eyes. Lift up your head for your redemption draws nigh." Sure, I can see what Russia's doing. And sure, I can see what China's doing. Sure, I can see what Trump is doing. I can see all of it. But you know what? When we see these things, lift up our head. Redemption is drawing nigh. This is a time, amen, to start preparing for the promise. Can you say amen? Amen. You, you, you, you have got a lot of troubles. Every one of us have got a lot of troubles. But I'm telling you right now, we are we we we've got a mighty God. And in this revival that is coming up, I I just want to give you a shot in the arm. Don't get Listen, if you've got your eyes lately off of the promises of God, get them on the promises. Amen. God is going to be moving in these meetings. We've got men that are preparing. Amen. They're they're they're fasting and praying and calling out to God for these services. Amen. Make sure that our expectation was where it should be. Lord, let me get out of the mlly grubs and let me come into your presence. Let me let me let me uh uh uh quit being drunk on the things of this world. Amen. Drunk on the cares of life. Amen. Drunk and numb. But oh God, I need more of you. I want more of you. I need more of you during these meetings. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Living in that world of faith. Living in that world of faith there in 2 Corinthians. Amen. 4:18. It's a scripture that I that I love to quote. Amen. While looking at things uh not at things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal. Amen. Your trials temporal. Your sickness is temporal. Amen. The discouragement you've gone through is temporal. The situations in your home right now is temporal. Amen. But he says, "But we look at the things which are not seen, for they are eternal." &gt;&gt; Eternal. Amen. Eternal. It's in the heavenly realm that we can see eternal purpose. It's in the heavenly realm that we can say, "God's got a purpose for this disaster coming my way." Amen. God's got a purpose for allowing this to happen. God's got a purpose. Amen. All things work together for the good to them that love God. God's got a purpose. And I can see the purpose. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. When we start thinking of how good papa has been. Amen. When we stop to think when we stop to think about how good he's been, then we've got to stop and thank him for all of the goodness. Oh, well, can you say amen? He's been good to me. Oh, I know I don't might not have things the way the way that I want them right now or Amen. Maybe things maybe I I am a little sick or maybe this that or the other. Hallelujah. But I just want to say God, you've been good to me. &gt;&gt; You've been good to me. You've invited me into this place with you. Amen. And when we start seeing ourselves in every promise, when the light begins to come on and we see the great pains that God has taken in this last day to make sure that you have got a pure faith when we stop to think of the goodness of God and how good God has been to send you a prophet. Amen. And all that has been done. Now listen to me friends. Amen. If if if it wasn't for for God to to to anoint men to Amen. take those tapes and collect them from all over the place and Amen. and put them together and a and have the message that we listen. We are a blessed people. God has went through great lengths to make sure that you know who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I begin to thank thank God for the ministers of this day. Amen. That are that are willing to study and a and pray and and dig into the message of the hour to give us this message. Listen folks, there's a lot of things to be thanking God for. And if we get into the heavenly places, we'll get out of the doom and gloom above all of the clouds and the muck and the mire. and we'll begin to see God's eternal purpose for us in our lives. And I say, God, I just want to stay up here in those heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's the way it should be. Amen. God, you've invested all of heaven in redemption. Hallelujah. When you look at these things, then your faith becomes intense. There becomes an intensess to you. Hey, God's done something and he's very serious about what he's given. Let me be intense about this. Now, I don't believe this meeting that's coming up is by accident. I believe God's ordained these this meeting. And God specifically put these men on my heart. It's a little bit different uh uh order than than what we have been. Amen. We we've always had uh at least had brother Sean and brother Jonathan and and and most of the time brother Wayne uh and then we we'd have the other ministers to come as well. Amen. And and they were home home folk, homegrown. We were Amen. just all we all grew up together in the ministry. Brother Wayne included. We were just all we were we were just all kids, you know, uh uh preaching together. And uh and I've got confidence in those men. Amen. But the Lord the Lord inspired my heart, amen, to go a different direction this year. And and and I I'm telling you, Amen. I I'm standing here behind this pull pit, amen, with a with a great expectation that God is going to do something in our meetings. God's going to do something. Amen. I I I I don't want to come Amen. And I I I think I I I don't want to just sit in church service and and and uh and and and just go through the routine and say it was another service. I want to touch God. I want to touch God. I need God. Listen, this preacher is coming into this meeting with a desperation for more of God. I I want more of God. And listen to me. If God has brought you into the church and he's been doing something for you, don't just sit there and and and let that opportunity pass by. Amen. Reach out. Get desperate before God and say, "God, while I'm in this church service, I need your presence. Speak to me. Help me. Encourage me. Deliver me. Whatever I have need of, God raised my faith." Can you say amen? those heavenly places. It's in those heavenly places that you begin to see things the way God see things. You begin to think the way God thinks. You begin it's it's a different thing now. Hallelujah. Amen. I I don't know if you've ever been there to where you've you've you've uh been been like Elisha's servant. Amen. And Elisha walks or the servant walks out the door and he sees all of the armies of the Syrians all around him. Now that's the flesh. That's the natural. Amen. He comes back in. He says, "Prophet of God, there's a they've got all I can see is nothing but armies of Syrians surrounding us." Hallelujah. Amen. And and and all I can see it's me and you. We We ain't got no soldiers. We ain't got no armies. They've got us. They've got us. They've got us trapped. Amen. But Elisha, the old prophet, he was already living in that other realm. And and he says, "Oh Lord, open this poor boy's eyes." He said, "Won't you go back out there and and take another look?" And and then when he goes out and takes another look, oh my. Then all of the heavens and the hills and everything around was full of angelic army. Oh my. What was it? It was the same situation, but somebody had moved into the heavenly places. Somebody began to see things the way God sees things. What you are looking at is terrible. It is terrible. But I just want to tell you, the armies of God are more terrible than the armies that are staring you down. Amen. God is a God of war. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll fight your battles. Can you say amen? And and and that's the reason we got to we got to stay in those heavenly places. Ephesians 4:8 comes to mind. Amen. Whatsoever things are are are lovely. Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of a good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, my home life is is is is not quite the way I want it." You can live with God in in a in in in such an atmosphere of love. Amen. That the weward child just don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the weward husband or the weward wife just doesn't know what to do. You can so live in that in the presence of God. Amen. That you create an aura about you. &gt;&gt; You're a miniature God. &gt;&gt; You're a miniature God. You are a son of God. You were made in the image of God. You are a creator. Well, can you say amen? Amen. You that's that's who you are. Brother Brandham would say, "I'm part of Charles Brandom because I'm his son. You're part of God because you're his son. You're born of his spirit, washed in his blood." Hallelujah. Yes, you are. You are part of him. You and you become a creator. Do you know that? Did you know that? Amen. He says that now it's it's a strange thing how that people the type of people and what we do and in our associations. He says now we we all have to face these facts that that there is people that you just love to be around and then there's people that's fine people and you love them yet there is something about that person you just can't hardly stay around them. Amen. We we want to talk a fact now that the re now the reason is is because of the atmosphere of that individual himself or herself what they create. But because you are a miniature creator, you are sons and daughters of God. No matter how far stooped in sin, you're still sons of and daughters of God because you're fallen degenerated in your soul and your mind. But God is your creator. And in your fallen estate, you're lost, undone creation of God, dominated by the devil. That's right. But you're still sons and daughters of God. But he's not willing that any should perish, but all might come to repentance. And he done everything that lays possible. Only God himself can do this. To give the opportunity to the creature of his to accept and to be what he wants you to be and to put you back in your right estate again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you're not now you don't have to carry an aura of of of misery. You don't have to carry an aura of discouragement. You don't have to carry an aura. Now you can create your own little world and live in it. It's a world of faith. It's a world of joy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many's ever started out your day and it's gone good and then amen, something happens and and before you know it, it messes with the chemical in your head and and and it just all of a sudden it just and before you know it, you've lost your strength. You're you're you're you're shaking in your in in in in your knees and you're amen and and you might have been working man just going and then all you can't get nothing else done that day is because something has come over you and your body is built amen to to react. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Your body is built to react. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so just the same as whatever came to you, whatever happened, whatever you read on your text or you heard or you you looked at Amen. And it caused all of a sudden just caused that that that and your stomach just sunk. That's the evil one. Trying to create an a an atmosphere of despair. Amen. And you want to just go in a dark room and just close the door and just stay there for a while. Amen. Well, maybe I'm the only one that ever does it. Amen. But I've counseledled too many people and I know it happens to the majority of us. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. It is something that comes and it creates something on you. But the prophet is saying what I'm trying to get you to understand. Amen. If that can happen to a fallen, degenerated a a a sinner who is a son of God, how much more to the one that's been born again, creating that atmosphere and say, "Oh, yeah. Amen. No, we're going to turn this thing back around. This body is going to come back where it belongs." Amen. And I've done it. I've done it. Been there, done that. Amen. I'll begin to turn some good solid music, Amen. gospel, and just begin to start praying. And before you know it, this old body just begins to to rise and rise rise right back up in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Been there, done that many times. Satan tried to take over. But I said, "No way. I'm not going to allow that. I am a creator &gt;&gt; and I am going to walk in the presence of God." &gt;&gt; Well, how many believes that's all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, "When we think of God, when we begin to when we begin to dream dreams of being well, when we dream dreams of being saved, when we get to thinking about our sins and how cruel it is before God, that's when he begins to draw near. That's when the then the the disciples brokenhearted going on the road to Emmas that Jesus stepped out of the bush and begin to talk to them while they were thinking of him. &gt;&gt; While they were thinking of it brings him near. It brings him near. So that's the reason you you say, "Well, what what kind of music?" Well, amen. It it ain't that contemporary junk that that's out there these days. I'll tell you that. Amen. But you you get some you get some good solid Amen. Just some good solid spiritfilled praying music and watch the presence of the Lord just come right back into your place. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? You're thinking on him and whatever thoughts caused that. Amen. They've got a the psychologists have got there there's there's a chemical that is released in your body and it just hallelujah. Well, God just brings on another chemical. Amen. And that that just starts bring brings you right back out of it. And you say, "Amen. I I I I I've talked to people." Amen. You go into that dark place when you you hate going into that dark place. Amen. I'm sort of going off my notes here, but you you hate going into that dark place because you're in that dark place for days. And Satan brings you in that. He wants you to stay in that dark place. But you don't have to stay in that dark place. &gt;&gt; You're a son of God. And the message of the hour has come to tell you. Amen. Take control of the situation. Take the word of God. Take the message of the hour. Amen. If there and and I'm not saying you have to turn on brother Brandham every time it happens, but I'm here to tell you, I've turned brother Brandham on many a time and that devil had to run. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's been plenty of time. Amen. It was just in prayer. It was always in prayer, but Amen. a listen to this or listening to a message that a brother preached or something and it drives those evil spirits away. My thoughts come right back to where it should and then I go to chasing that devil saying not today devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. So, so brother brother Brandham says when we begin to dream dreams of being healed, I think God wants us to be dreamers. He says, "Think big, dream big, ask big." Amen. Because God's a big big God. Hallelujah. Amen. He says, He says, "You you think the little the the little mouse around the gardeners of Egypt when they had all of that that wheat stocked up and stored up, you think they just ate a little bit at a time?" He said, "Oh, no. They ate until their little bodies were content." Hallelujah. They were fat and plump. Why? because they knew where the grain was and they knew that it was available. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say I know where the supernatural is. The prophet has taught us where it's at. &gt;&gt; The prophet has told us how to get there. We preach about it every which direction, but somebody's got to say, "Ha, there's a formula. There's a formula. Let me take the formula and let me mess press on. Can you say amen? Amen. That's right. Uh you know that I I was I I was thinking of a couple discouraged guys. Amen. Uh uh uh today. And uh you know the psalmist was all discouraged and and he was he was he you know he was discouraged and and uh amen. and and and he said I just just breaking in here Psalm Psalms 39 and2 and said I I I was dumb with silence. I held my peace even from good even from good and my sorrow was stirred but he said my heart was hot within me while I mused the fire burned and then I spake with my tongue. Now what was he talking about there? He was in his discouragement. He says I'm just I'm going to be silent. I'm not. But then he began to think about the goodness of the Lord and began to think about the the blessings of the Lord. And then a fire begin to burn within him. And then then he was able to start speaking the word one more time. Jeremiah was the same way. Jeremiah 209. Amen. He said, "I will not then said I. I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name." But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forebearing and I could not stay. Why? Because the word of God was dwelling richly within him. &gt;&gt; Both of these instances they were discouraged puppies but they chose to think on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Well, Brother Wendle, I I I just don't know if God I I I dream and I think and I I just want to tell you, Hallelujah. You can't dream You can't dream big enough. You can't dream big enough. &gt;&gt; God's a big God. And God is coming this day to satisfy your heart. Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. There there is nothing too big. Nothing too big. Every matter of fact um um Ephesians 3 and 20 sister keys. Amen. I believe three and 20 is now unto him that is able to do exceeding &gt;&gt; abundantly &gt;&gt; above. Everyone say exceeding &gt;&gt; abundantly &gt;&gt; above &gt;&gt; all that we ask or think. You think about it, you get those bra those those dreams high enough. Whatever your dream is, whatever you're asking the Lord, he is able to do exceedingly abundantly exceedingly abundantly above all that we would ask or think. That's right. Oh, on these, think on these things. Whatsoever are pure, whatsoever honest, whatsoever are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report. think on these things and he is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we would ask or think. You know what that tells me? Amen. You're a creator. &gt;&gt; Now, it takes God to do the creating, but you know how to work the system. He's the one. It's his word. You're thinking on his word. You're loving his word. He's coming on the scene fulfilling his word in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, because the prophet Dun P, he put it very plainly. You have no power. So, going around there is claiming that we've all got power. We have no power. There's nothing in us. But Papa does. We're believing his word and we're speaking his word and we're claiming his word and we are becoming everything. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like I I I like the I I I like the uh I'm I'm a King James version guy, but I I I I sometimes I'll bring the amplified in because I I I I like to amplify it a little bit. Amen. Ephesians 3:20 in the amplified. Now unto him that is able to carry out his purpose and do super abundantly more than all we dare ask or think infinitely above our greatest prayers, hopes or dreams according to the power, expectations that is at work within us. Someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's a God of promises. Amen. And his promises are still yes and amen. There is no variableness with God. He's unchanging in nature. He's unchanging in decree. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now this is the reason why I say when we get into those heavenly places, let you take these scriptures. I'm going to give you a couple scriptures and I'm going to shut up. Hallelujah. Amen. God cannot lie. Numbers 23 and 19. God is not a man that he should lie, &gt;&gt; neither the son of man that he should repent. Hath he said, and everyone say it with me, shall he not do it? Hath he spoken? And y'all say it with me. And shall he not make it good? &gt;&gt; Oh, that should be enough right there to to send you to those heavenly places right now. G. &gt;&gt; That should be enough to just put you right over the moon right there. Amen. Beside Jesus and said, "All right, I I'm standing right here with you." Amen. All things are possible. Can you say amen? All right, let's look at this one. He's the author of every good and perfect gift. Let's look at it. James 1:17. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning. God is God's not shaky &gt;&gt; and God's not double-minded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only way God could be double-minded and that would be drunk. And he's not drunk. He's got a steady mind. When God thinks something, it is forever. God called you, it is forever. If God said you're his son, it is forever. If God said you're his daughter, Len, it is forever. It is God's divine decree and it's forever. &gt;&gt; Len was telling me this morning, she said, "You just preach to all the guys all the time and not the not not not the women." So, Amen. sons and daughter. Amen. All right. Now, amen. So, so the the the promises there's no changing. There's some of some of you, you had a girlfriend and then you she ain't the one. Amen. There's some of you that that's that's that's that's tried jobs. This ain't the one. But when God does something, it's perfect. And when God says something, it's perfect. You can believe him. Now, now, now, now catch this. Now, he's he says, "Come down from the father of lights with whom there is no variables, no shadow of turning." And then he then he then he begins to show you who you are of his own will be he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures. What creatures? The heavenly creatures. the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the firstborn among the creation. Amen. Jesus was that new creation. Amen. We've already gone through that with with with with a lot of scriptures here in the past. Jesus was the firstborn of the new creation. That's why you are born again. You can't look at things through these eyes, through these ears, through nothing. And if you do, you're going to be the most miserable guy and woman there is. Because there is nothing that that there is nothing stable about this stinking flesh. &gt;&gt; Nothing stable about this body. Nothing stable about this world. Hallelujah. But he's saying God doesn't change and there's no variableness in him. And then he gives you a little wink and says, "And you are off the you're a chip off of the old block &gt;&gt; of his own will be get he us with the word of truth." You're a chip off the old block. So that's telling you deep down inside you can stand up with the word of God and say, "I believe it. I claim it." &gt;&gt; Everyone of of my dreams, if God were to speak here tonight, he would stand up. If God were to speak tonight, amen, say, "Hey, Wendle, I want to use the microphone for a minute." And he would he would he and he'd stand up and say, "Hey, every one of my dreams come true." &gt;&gt; Every dream that God has ever dreamed, every thought that he has ever thought has come to pass. [Music] Isaiah 55:8, "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, that but waters the earth, and maketh it to uh uh uh uh to maketh it bring forth and blood, that it may give seed to the swer, and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish. Someone shout hallelujah. that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing that I have seen it. You shall go out with joy and be led with peace, and the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. You know what he's talking about? He's talking about redemption. He's talking about, sons of God, the time is coming. The time is coming. I've given you my word. You are going to stand in your position once again. &gt;&gt; Dear God, have we been a blessed people to know these kinds of things? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; My word's coming to you and it ain't coming to you void. My word's going to come back to me, but it ain't coming back void. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to see the accomplishment of what I have spoken. I'm going to see it living in you. I'm going to see my word coming to pass through you. I'm going to have sons and daughters that are living in the glory. &gt;&gt; Well, I could just shut up right now and I we could all go home and I guarantee you those are some good thoughts to be thinking about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. Oh, get out of that doom and gloom stuff. Get up there in those heavenly places. And I'm here to tell you, I really feel in my heart God's going to do something special. I just believe God's going to do something special. You know why? Amen. And it's not because God's feeling sorry for us. Their sons and daughters coming into their position and expecting. They're expecting. Sons and daughters are believing. We're not We're not beggars. We're sons and daughters of God. And we're coming into this meeting expecting to meet with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now remember without the promise there is no expectation without the expectation there is no preparation. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So if you don't have this settled in your heart if this is just one among many among many things then the expectation's not going to be there and the preparation's not going to be there. expectation. Without the promise, there's no expectation. Without expectation, there's no preparation. The promise is here in order to generate expectation. &gt;&gt; And then expectation causes preparation which brings to pass the promise that God has given. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. I love that. I love that. Praise the Lord. The word becomes vision to you. It becomes the absolute and you walk only by that sight and that sight alone. If the musicians would come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Bradom says the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest. That's right. A Christian is not tossed about. A Christian doesn't run from place to place. A Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things. A Christian rests. It's all over. It's all finished for the believer at Calvary. Oh, sickness may come and disappointments, but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed. Amen. We accept that word tonight. I'm accepting that word tonight. I'm releasing my faith. It's because of the promise that was given. It's because the message of the hour. The message of the hour has come to release my faith. Amen. The book of Galatians third chapter says, "Before faith, before faith, we were shut up unto faith under the law, but we're no longer under the law of sin and death. Now the promises are real." God says, "My word is yes and amen, and there's no variableness." Then he turns around and says, "Hey, you're a chip off the old block. You can walk in that same kind of faith." And I say, "So be it, Lord." We're going to walk in that kind of faith. Hallelujah. Walking with that assurance. Well, can you say amen? Amen. Hallelujah. Take all my skepticism away, Lord. Take all the doubts. Squatch the doubts. All the sin put under the blood. Standing pure and clean. We're looking at everything in our hearts and our minds. Might need to go make things right with a brother or sister, mom, dad, husband, wife, because you don't want no hindrance from the word of God. anything, any kind of vibration of your soul. God don't want no variableness. Now, there's a vibration in your soul. Your faith knows that. You can't fake it. Your soul knows it. Just go get it right. Go make it right with God. Go make it right with your brother. Go make it right with whoever it is. Whether it's might be your boss. Get things right. Be honest. Be pure. Because God has called us to purity. And this ain't a bunch of flapping jaws and this ain't a bunch of charismatic junk. Name it, claim it. Well, we live like the devil. No. No. You're a germ seed of God. And God can't bless when there is sin. He sure ain't going to bless you with a closer walk with him. And you might be blessed in the natural, but you can't you can't look at the natural things as a blessing as if God's pleased. &gt;&gt; Amen. Israel was blessed. And they they they are eternally dead. Israel was blessed. The elect was drinking from the water that came out of the rock, the supernatural, just like the other two million. But the other two million, amen, could not walk with God. Could not believe God. Miracle after miracle, God blessing them here, God feeding them mana, God doing all of that, but they never would change. They never would get things under the blood. They they they said, "Oh, but God's blessing me. He just gave me drink. He's g No, that's not who we are. Amen. Those people died. But those that elect that came under the prophet Moses and said, "We want to believe that word the way you have preached it. Teach us how to get over to the other side." Did you know that even when they were going over to the other side, Moses came out with the command of God and says, "I want you to sanctify you yourselves." He said, "Don't even come at your wives." He said, "I want these next three days. I want you to sanctify your hearts and purify yourselves. Get ready to cross over into that promised land. It's very serious. It's very serious with with this great vast of inspiration that God has given us is also great responsibility. Great responsibility. I'm not free. I'm not free to hate my brother. I'm not free to carry grudges. I'm not free, amen, to smoke my dope. I'm not free to drink that alcohol. I'm not free to live in adultery. I'm not free, amen, to go chasing other girls and and and and commit adultery on my wife. I'm not free. The word has come to me and I am to sanctify myself before him and say, "Here I am. Wash me as I look in the mirror of your word. Wash me. I see some things in here. Wash me. Purify me. How many wants a pure heart? Now, I I I done some of the natural the the things that you know, just common sins. But you know your heart. You know that if you've got a grudge in your heart towards somebody, you know that if that that if you don't, you know, you're on the that internet all the time and you're so drunk with that internet and you're just numb to the things of God to you can't even get you can't even kneel down to pray anymore and feel his presence is because it's numbed your spirit. You you're you're you're a son of God. You're a daughter of God. you know, [Music] purify me. I got this meeting coming up and I'm desperate for you. I am needing something from the Lord. I don't want this to be church as usual. I need the presence of the Lord. If you're struggling, get those high places, heavenly places. Uh, get rid of all of that earthly stuff, all of this stuff.
