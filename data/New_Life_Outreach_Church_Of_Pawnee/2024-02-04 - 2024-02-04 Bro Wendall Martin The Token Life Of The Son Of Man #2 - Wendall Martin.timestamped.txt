[46:58] we got our tummies full and sometimes
[47:00] it's a little a little hard on on these
[47:04] Sunday nights but uh I believe if we
[47:06] make the effort to come God will make
[47:08] the effort to be here you know brother
[47:10] bradam said that he always shows up
[47:14] where he's wanted and so how many wants
[47:17] him here tonight amen we want the Holy
[47:21] Spirit to be here with us if you have
[47:23] your Bibles we'll look here in St John
[47:26] the 14th
[47:27] chapter and um we want to
[47:32] um keep sister Karen in our prayers
[47:35] she's going to be uh going in for
[47:37] surgery on on that arm that the wrist
[47:40] that she broke and so that's that's
[47:42] going to be this this coming Tuesday so
[47:45] at the end of the service sister sh
[47:47] Karen we want to uh pray with you and
[47:51] and um amen she she broke that was a
[47:55] clean that that was a good cut uh cut it
[47:58] all the way she she broke it all the way
[47:59] through but um it's a it's a real uh
[48:03] going to be a tedious operation and and
[48:07] um right there where it happened and so
[48:09] it's just um but we're just believing
[48:11] the Lord's going to be with her and be
[48:14] with the
[48:15] surgeon and um so we want to do that
[48:18] before we uh dismiss tonight and um how
[48:22] many enjoyed the word of the Lord this
[48:23] morning wasn't that just wonderful
[48:27] amen I love that word this morning let's
[48:29] look here in St John 14 and we'll let's
[48:32] just start at the 13th
[48:33] verse and whatsoever ye shall ask in my
[48:37] name that will I do that the father may
[48:41] be glorified in the sun if you shall ask
[48:44] anything in my name I will do it if ye
[48:48] love me keep my
[48:51] Commandments I will pray the father and
[48:54] he will give give you another comforter
[48:57] that he may abide with you forever even
[49:00] the spirit of Truth whom the world
[49:02] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[49:06] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[49:10] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[49:14] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[49:16] come to you yet a little while and the
[49:19] world sees me no more but ye see me
[49:23] because I live you shall live also
[49:26] at that day you shall know that I'm in
[49:29] the father ye in me and I in you now
[49:34] brother brandham would say that this is
[49:37] the day this day is the day that brother
[49:41] BR or that that Jesus was talking about
[49:43] in that day I will be in you you will be
[49:47] in me and the world will know it amen
[49:50] and then a very familiar passage of
[49:51] scripture there in in Revelations
[49:54] 10 and one just going to read the first
[49:57] two verses and I saw another Mighty
[50:00] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[50:02] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[50:07] his face where as it the Sun and his
[50:10] feet as pillars of fire and he had in
[50:13] his hand a little book open and he set
[50:15] his right foot upon the sea his left
[50:18] foot upon the earth now if you would go
[50:20] back and read there in the first chapter
[50:23] of Revelations you would know that the
[50:25] was Christ amen this was Christ that has
[50:28] been promised in this day what a promise
[50:33] father we want to thank you today for
[50:35] your love thank you for your blessings
[50:38] and the anointing of the holy spirit
[50:41] that we feel
[50:42] tonight thank you for the message this
[50:46] morning Lord thank you for people who
[50:49] still have a craving for you and to love
[50:54] you and to know you and your presence to
[50:56] be with them I ask God that you would
[51:00] just be here
[51:02] tonight Lord we want the power of your
[51:04] Holy Spirit In Our Lives Lord we want
[51:08] everything that you've promised for this
[51:10] day for we know that without your life
[51:14] Lord life is meaningless and without
[51:17] your life there is no Rapture for us so
[51:20] Lord we want your life within us now God
[51:24] I just pray that your Spirit would be
[51:26] here in everything that is done and said
[51:29] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:31] Christ can the church say
[51:34] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[51:38] seated I want to speak tonight amen um
[51:44] along the lines again of the token life
[51:47] of the son of
[51:49] man and uh we've been talking about the
[51:51] son of man and and what the
[51:55] the son of man is and and so we want the
[51:58] token life of the son of man we there
[52:02] have been a few
[52:03] questions uh along those lines amen what
[52:08] is the what's the difference why why
[52:11] make a big
[52:13] deal uh uh or um if the Holy Ghost is
[52:18] the Holy Ghost then then why do we um
[52:23] you know talk about the of man the Son
[52:26] of God the son of David and um we
[52:30] understand that the son of man is has
[52:33] been promised for for our day and how
[52:37] that the Holy Spirit would take form in
[52:41] humans as the son of man in the last
[52:44] days this would be the logos of God Amen
[52:48] manifested in flesh and and it's it's
[52:52] still the same Holy Ghost it was the
[52:55] holy ghost in Jesus that made him the
[52:58] son of man he was he was the god of the
[53:01] Old Testament living in a body and so
[53:05] you can see as we as as I put here amen
[53:09] we've got the son of man can you'all see
[53:11] that we we've got um the son of man uh
[53:15] it's the same Holy Ghost In Christ it's
[53:18] the holy ghost in a man in The Seven
[53:21] Ages it's the Son of God the Holy Ghost
[53:23] as intercessor through Seven Ages
[53:26] because the Seven Ages amen since the
[53:29] Antichrist has come in the church is not
[53:32] in its completion amen the church is not
[53:36] where it should be what it needs to be
[53:38] so we have got the intercessor the Son
[53:41] of God but the promise has been in this
[53:45] last days amen right before the Rapture
[53:48] time there would be a bride time in this
[53:52] evening time of the of the leoty and age
[53:55] and Christ would come again he would
[53:59] come with an open book this would be the
[54:01] the fullness of God if you will coming
[54:04] down to give life to the people for the
[54:09] for the Rapture and so you you can see
[54:13] amen the original Christ Pentecost that
[54:15] early that that first church had the son
[54:18] of man then we' went to the son of Son
[54:20] of God it's still the same Holy Ghost
[54:24] but the holy ghost have the fullness of
[54:26] Christ and the church the holy spirit
[54:30] will lead and guide this church like no
[54:34] other age since
[54:35] Pentecost amen that's the promise of
[54:39] this age that's that's where we're going
[54:41] so when we talk about it's still it's
[54:44] all the Holy Ghost but it's God been
[54:48] promised in this day greater than than
[54:52] any other day because the re Revelation
[54:56] has come back to us like it was at the
[54:59] beginning the anointing is here for that
[55:02] and so amen just to give a little bit of
[55:05] Prelude to what I'm fixing to to to talk
[55:08] to you about here this evening I believe
[55:11] that there should be a cry within the
[55:15] church for the genuine baptism of the
[55:18] Holy
[55:19] Ghost amen the Holy Spirit could not
[55:22] fill the Luther it was the Holy Ghost
[55:26] coming up through the plant amen it was
[55:28] the life it was the life of God in this
[55:31] sea that that came through and stuck its
[55:34] head up after the the the the the Dark
[55:36] Ages through Luther life was there
[55:39] that's why it was green that's why it
[55:40] was growing it was the Holy Ghost in
[55:43] that plant but it was not giving the
[55:46] token life that went into the ground
[55:49] amen the Holy Ghost came up to Wesley
[55:52] amen and and and through and through the
[55:55] leaves and the stock came on up through
[55:57] through 1906 you see but it could not be
[56:01] the fullness because the plant had not
[56:04] come to its
[56:06] completion if there's ever a time for us
[56:10] to desire and seek for the fullness of
[56:14] God this fullness is not amen learning
[56:18] we had the book all along but you see it
[56:21] was the son of man that Mighty angel
[56:25] with the rainbow over his head it was
[56:28] the Holy Ghost like never before coming
[56:32] and putting his feet upon the land and
[56:35] the Sea can you say man now brother
[56:38] brandham would say I challenge you to
[56:40] believe God what what is that it's the
[56:44] identification of Jesus Christ you say
[56:47] what is that he is the word in the
[56:49] beginning was the word the word was with
[56:51] God the word was made Flash and dwelt
[56:54] Among Us the word is sharper than a
[56:56] two-edged sword a discerner of the
[56:57] thought and intents of the heart can't
[57:00] you see the word has come Among Us in
[57:03] this last days it's the Holy Spirit
[57:06] taking the word of God identifying Jesus
[57:10] Christ which is the token you could not
[57:14] have the token life in 1906 it was not
[57:18] given that was just a portion that was a
[57:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it was
[57:25] not the fullness of the plan now now
[57:28] brother Brandon would talk
[57:30] about in in the church age book the
[57:32] resume of the ages he he would say the
[57:35] birth of the church was at Pentecost and
[57:37] at and as the first Adam was given a
[57:40] bride fresh from the hand of God and was
[57:43] UN undefiled for a certain
[57:46] span so was Christ the last Adam given
[57:51] the pure Bri uh given a bride pure and
[57:54] fresh at Pentecost and she remained
[57:58] separate and undefiled for some time now
[58:01] how long this continued we do not know
[58:03] but one day even as Eve was tempted and
[58:06] seduced by Satan so the church was
[58:08] contaminated by the entrance of the
[58:11] Antichrist spirit and we understand that
[58:14] was right there in that first age Amen
[58:16] to where that church had fallen and the
[58:19] the original word seed bride fell are
[58:24] are y
[58:25] understanding me it was the Antichrist
[58:27] denominational Spirit Christ was no
[58:30] longer the head he was no longer their
[58:34] all in all that first church left her
[58:37] first love begin to wander and taken
[58:40] other men's ideas Creeds dogmas instead
[58:44] of God's and and and and the first
[58:47] church believed nothing but what God
[58:51] Said and what God Said alone can you say
[58:54] say amen amen and now now we find that
[58:58] even uh through the whole uh Church age
[59:01] it's been the Son of God and and and and
[59:04] there in in in in uh Romans the 8th
[59:07] chapter we we can understand why brother
[59:10] brandham would put this as the Son of
[59:12] God because uh as the holy ghost in the
[59:16] uh in the in between and that is because
[59:18] of the he's he is it's the spirit of
[59:20] Christ interceding for us it's the
[59:23] spirit of Christ
[59:25] amen that is there in in in 8 and 26 it
[59:29] says uh it says likewise the spirit also
[59:33] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[59:36] what we should pray as we ought the
[59:38] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[59:41] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[59:43] he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[59:45] what is the mind of the spirit because
[59:47] he maketh intercession intercession for
[59:50] the saints of God according to the will
[59:52] of God so so we can see that the the
[59:54] holy spirit is the
[59:56] intercessor that is in between it's the
[59:59] same spirit of God intered there is a
[1:00:03] lamb set on the throne there's a lamb's
[1:00:06] blood that is there the holy spirit is
[1:00:09] interceding for the church age in her
[1:00:13] imperfection God is saying I will not
[1:00:16] leave this church like I done Eden I am
[1:00:20] going to stay here and restore her and
[1:00:25] make her what she is supposed to be what
[1:00:28] I had in my mind for her well praise the
[1:00:32] Lord amen what I had in my mind for her
[1:00:37] is where I'm going now amen ausa was
[1:00:41] still under the Reformation amen now now
[1:00:45] brother brandom would say if the true
[1:00:48] spirit of God there it it'll direct into
[1:00:51] the word not just one place in the word
[1:00:54] the the entire word for the entire age
[1:00:57] it says now Pentecost the spirit
[1:00:59] directed it uh right right into that to
[1:01:02] Joel 238 uh the day of Luther it
[1:01:05] directed it right into that Wesley and
[1:01:08] in this last Pentecostal move but this
[1:01:11] is another age this is a calling out of
[1:01:14] the Bride amen he says the the Holy
[1:01:17] Spirit was in Luther the Holy Spirit was
[1:01:19] in Wesley and God's word being anointed
[1:01:23] the Holy Spirit turned to the people of
[1:01:25] the age and they begin to have the
[1:01:27] restoration of the gifts and they found
[1:01:29] out by yielding themselves to God the
[1:01:32] Holy Ghost spoke it through tongues
[1:01:34] through them they laid hands on the sick
[1:01:37] they was recovered they danced in the
[1:01:39] spirit that was the age of
[1:01:44] reformation bringing the church back
[1:01:47] into order and the last order of the
[1:01:50] church was the placing of the gifts into
[1:01:52] the church like Luther was placed just
[1:01:54] ification Wesley sanctification the
[1:01:56] Pentecostals place the gifts now he goes
[1:01:59] on down he says but now is the bride
[1:02:02] calling now is when the Seven Seals has
[1:02:05] been opened now when the complete things
[1:02:08] that the reformers left off has been
[1:02:10] open only Malachi 4 can do that because
[1:02:13] it takes the Revelation straight from
[1:02:16] God to an individual to do so that's
[1:02:19] right it can't come to a group it never
[1:02:22] did one man that's what God promised in
[1:02:25] the shadows of his coming for the bride
[1:02:27] and elzer well can you say Amen so so we
[1:02:31] can see here as you're if you're
[1:02:33] following me along amen they thought
[1:02:36] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost which
[1:02:38] was the restoration of the gifts was
[1:02:42] amen the final outpouring of the Holy
[1:02:44] Ghost it was still under
[1:02:48] Reformation amen now now what what what
[1:02:51] do we mean by Reformation it was still
[1:02:53] under the man age the man age was still
[1:02:57] under Reformation they had been they had
[1:03:00] come from justification sanctification
[1:03:02] speaking in tongues knowing that that
[1:03:05] had to come Hallelujah but the realities
[1:03:09] of God could only come through a prophet
[1:03:14] messenger amen can you say Amen now I I
[1:03:18] want us to to to look here it took an
[1:03:21] elzer now another scripture or another
[1:03:24] quote that I want to that I just want to
[1:03:26] put here that amen that Pentecost was a
[1:03:28] Reformation is in the rater message
[1:03:31] message and he says what if what if
[1:03:33] Moses would have come and brought Noah's
[1:03:35] message will build an ark and float down
[1:03:37] the Nile it wouldn't have worked but
[1:03:39] neither was Jesus message ever worked by
[1:03:41] Moses neither will Wesley's message ever
[1:03:44] work in Luther Luther's message vice
[1:03:45] versa today our last great Reformation
[1:03:49] was Pentecost but we're moving from that
[1:03:53] and the Pentecostal message won't mix
[1:03:57] with this because it is another day can
[1:04:01] you say amen amen he he uses another he
[1:04:04] begins to talk about the the the three
[1:04:07] stages the three women representing the
[1:04:09] three stages he talks about Sarah Hagar
[1:04:14] and then talks about Mary amen and he
[1:04:16] and he says now these three women were
[1:04:20] carriers amen one one brought forth a
[1:04:24] natural son another one brought forth uh
[1:04:27] the the uh
[1:04:29] uh uh the bond son the other one brought
[1:04:33] forth the word then he takes the three
[1:04:36] stages and he begins to use this do it
[1:04:39] this way amen he takes the blade stalk
[1:04:41] and shuck he says we we've had the three
[1:04:45] women that have brought it in but it
[1:04:47] will take the Shu or the Pentecostal
[1:04:51] 1906 move to bring on the reality of the
[1:04:56] word for the day now he would say there
[1:04:59] in that the seed is is not air with a
[1:05:01] Shu he says we can see the true
[1:05:04] revelation of the true type there's
[1:05:06] three women carriers of the natural seed
[1:05:09] until matured into Jesus Christ amen he
[1:05:13] says the shu is a carrier that's exactly
[1:05:16] what our denominations have been a
[1:05:18] carrier Luther Wesley Pentecostals and
[1:05:22] now it's time for the seed to come forth
[1:05:27] notice she was not the seed Mary was not
[1:05:30] just a Shu the tassel stock carriers of
[1:05:34] part of the word not all of the word
[1:05:38] Luther had justification Wesley had
[1:05:41] sanctification Pentecostals had
[1:05:43] restoration of the gifts but when the
[1:05:47] word came that's your time to start
[1:05:49] shouting hallelujah amen he says now
[1:05:52] they could produce that justification
[1:05:54] will save a man you believe that sure
[1:05:56] it's a carrier of the word it's the same
[1:05:58] as the stock it's part of the weak sure
[1:06:00] it is but it's a carrier it ain't the
[1:06:05] life it ain't the life now Brothers I
[1:06:09] just want to tell you this message is
[1:06:11] not learning and I I I I want us all I
[1:06:15] want us to be filled with the same holy
[1:06:17] spirit that came down in in two or in
[1:06:22] 1963 I believe Arizona
[1:06:25] 1963 when that cloud came down that was
[1:06:29] the Holy Spirit of all Seven Ages coming
[1:06:34] to the Bride of Jesus
[1:06:37] christall Hallelujah I believe it amen
[1:06:41] now it goes how many believes in
[1:06:42] sanctification you you have you believe
[1:06:44] the Bible you have to sure it's it's a
[1:06:47] little more that that's that's two more
[1:06:49] words but then come the Pentecost the
[1:06:51] restoration of the gifts amen speaking
[1:06:53] in tongues they call it the initial
[1:06:55] evidence of of the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:06:57] in tongues they call uh they call it the
[1:06:59] initial evidence which brought forth the
[1:07:02] what the Shu they denominated but when
[1:07:05] you say I and my father are one these
[1:07:07] other things then the Shu begins to pull
[1:07:09] away from it that the real genuine bride
[1:07:13] church will bring forth the entire word
[1:07:17] of God in its fullness in its Mist amen
[1:07:22] for he's the same
[1:07:24] yesterday today and forever can you say
[1:07:28] amen amen he says now the world is in a
[1:07:32] is is in a Sodom condition church has
[1:07:34] went into Sodom like lot and his wife
[1:07:36] and I say there's an elect church
[1:07:38] somewhere in this world that's pull out
[1:07:40] set aside of those things and the
[1:07:43] manifestation of God has attracted its
[1:07:45] attention where're at the last days the
[1:07:47] Shu has give forth its strength into the
[1:07:50] sea it's went on out it's been it was a
[1:07:54] good sh but it served its time now see
[1:07:57] it is word Bride of the word groom amen
[1:08:03] cannot he says it's the seed time Brad
[1:08:08] time the shars are dead the sharks are
[1:08:11] dried up the Virgin word time not touch
[1:08:16] it's virgin and remember a virgin word
[1:08:21] time now what is what what what is all
[1:08:24] of this link because brother brandham
[1:08:26] just isn't smart enough to make this up
[1:08:27] on his own all right the holy spirit is
[1:08:31] directing this prophet and pointing
[1:08:34] these things out so that we can truly
[1:08:37] see where we are he's putting these
[1:08:40] stages in there so that you and I can
[1:08:43] identify where our desires and where our
[1:08:46] focus should be in this evening
[1:08:49] time
[1:08:50] Hallelujah the
[1:08:52] fullness of the son of man could not
[1:08:56] come in this in this calf age in this
[1:09:01] man age it can only come in the eagle

[1:17:36] Revelation I've been praying God let
[1:17:39] there be a revelation strike us like
[1:17:40] never
[1:17:41] before it's not important that you
[1:17:44] understand with this what's important is
[1:17:46] the Holy Spirit to baptize because if we
[1:17:49] ever get the life of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:51] right here h it'll live this right here
[1:17:54] we G no one had to teach Jesus on what
[1:17:57] he was going to be no amen he was that
[1:18:01] word and I say this last day bride amen

[1:18:12] were hundreds and hundreds probably
[1:18:13] close to a thousand people there amen

[1:18:18] another brother had been preaching on
[1:18:20] the Holy Ghost amen and and and and just

[1:18:26] stood up afterwards and he says how many
[1:18:28] how many believes this message amen yeah
[1:18:32] beles believes the prophet in this
[1:18:34] message so the whole congregation just
[1:18:36] raised their hands he says you've got
[1:18:37] the Holy Ghost case dismissed Hallelujah
[1:18:40] that that that's blaspheming it's not
[1:18:43] what you believe it's not what you have
[1:18:45] it's what you are
[1:18:49] here Devils believe and tremble amen
[1:18:53] that's the reason why that's the reason
[1:18:55] why this message has got so many
[1:18:56] denominations going because we got too
[1:18:58] many men without the Holy
[1:19:00] Ghost we got too many people that don't
[1:19:03] know about the life of God in them you
[1:19:05] ever get the same life you get that same
[1:19:07] anointing you get that same person of
[1:19:10] the Holy Ghost that came down in
[1:19:12] 1963 that Revelations 10 anointing it'll
[1:19:16] reveal the book to you buddy just
[1:19:18] exactly like the prophet brought
[1:19:20] it amen and you say
[1:19:24] amen that's where we are amen now
[1:19:29] brother Brandon would say now then the
[1:19:31] three
[1:19:32] stages comes the church out from
[1:19:37] justification
[1:19:39] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:19:41] Ghost
[1:19:44] Hallelujah
[1:19:46] justification
[1:19:47] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:19:50] Ghost let me read it again
[1:19:53] justification
[1:19:55] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:58] him incarnate God made manifest Among
[1:20:04] Us amen another quote then the church
[1:20:08] came out of the Dark Ages
[1:20:10] justification
[1:20:12] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:15] Incarnate
[1:20:18] Word another
[1:20:19] quote justification made way
[1:20:23] for uh justification made way for
[1:20:25] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:20:28] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:20:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:20:33] the Holy Ghost itself to come down in
[1:20:37] Perfection back to the word again to
[1:20:42] manifest itself amen hallelujah can you
[1:20:46] say amen amen amen I probably shouldn't
[1:20:49] have put that in my mouth praise the
[1:20:51] Lord what God is
[1:20:53] doing where God is
[1:20:57] going it's the
[1:20:59] season it's the
[1:21:01] time the anointing is
[1:21:04] here not an
[1:21:07] anointing but the person of the almighty
[1:21:10] God because he knows there's a person
[1:21:13] there's some young people that's going
[1:21:15] to want it more than ever he says why
[1:21:18] did God send it to you he says cuz he
[1:21:20] knew you would want it yeah as brother
[1:21:23] Josh was saying about predestination he
[1:21:25] knew you would want it he said it in
[1:21:28] this day because you were going to Crave
[1:21:32] for it you you you he said it in this
[1:21:35] day and allowed you to have this message
[1:21:38] because just a little bit of emotion
[1:21:41] wasn't going to do anything for you can
[1:21:43] you say am man you see the genuine
[1:21:46] baptism now you say now brother w What
[1:21:48] does it mean why wh what what I I just I
[1:21:50] just don't quite understand when you say
[1:21:52] the the the the the the the Holy Ghost
[1:21:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it
[1:21:57] made way for the Holy Ghost itself you
[1:21:59] see the baptism amen you can you can
[1:22:03] speak in tongues you can have be
[1:22:06] baptized and have all of all of the nine
[1:22:10] spiritual gifts and not have the
[1:22:15] giver hallelujah it's the same holy
[1:22:18] ghost that Luther
[1:22:20] had but in a greater light
[1:22:23] but God's wanting the word
[1:22:27] itself the
[1:22:29] logos this ain't the word this is just
[1:22:31] representative of the word this was all
[1:22:33] written this had a time that this was
[1:22:35] produced this had a Time amen where
[1:22:38] where every Bible will every every Bible
[1:22:41] and every page will be gone it'll this
[1:22:44] is not Eternal this is this had a time
[1:22:47] that it was made it had a time that it's
[1:22:48] going to die it it's i' I've went
[1:22:51] through a couple of these B babies this
[1:22:53] is not Eternal but the this
[1:22:57] represents the Eternal
[1:23:00] one this book was not with God before
[1:23:03] the foundation of the world but that
[1:23:05] logos was with God before the foundation
[1:23:09] of the world the Loos The Living Word of
[1:23:14] God becoming flesh in this end time amen
[1:23:20] hallelujah hallelujah and when we listen
[1:23:24] to that message here
[1:23:26] tonight as the as we were listening to
[1:23:29] brother bradam Minister a little on the
[1:23:32] token and then
[1:23:34] ministering man we we heard
[1:23:37] him as as we as as he begin to discern
[1:23:41] the Holy Spirit begin to discern the
[1:23:44] hearts
[1:23:48] never never has there ever been the Holy
[1:23:51] Ghost going on earth like it been in
[1:23:54] this
[1:23:55] generation yes sir except for the days
[1:23:58] of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:59] Christ
[1:24:04] never has it ever fallen and rested so
[1:24:08] on a man like it done William
[1:24:13] Brandon and like it's doing in this
[1:24:17] bride you say no no I she under her
[1:24:23] Messenger will become the final
[1:24:27] voice to the final age Hallelujah no not
[1:24:32] quoting your quotes not reading your
[1:24:36] books but understanding your position
[1:24:40] your position in time he come to
[1:24:43] separate you so that you would know who
[1:24:47] you are and God would place
[1:24:51] you
[1:24:53] right can I tell you what the other one
[1:24:55] is amen he would say
[1:24:58] justification
[1:24:59] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:03] he says but you still got to be adopted
[1:25:05] right come on come on what is adoption
[1:25:10] it is the
[1:25:11] placing of the son over the
[1:25:16] inheritance
[1:25:18] right praise the
[1:25:21] Lord
[1:25:23] when we talk about the
[1:25:25] seal did you know that brother Bram when
[1:25:27] he preached the token I think he
[1:25:29] preached the token several
[1:25:30] times and he would Say Never And this
[1:25:34] ain't this ain't just a this ain't just
[1:25:36] a little mistake that he said because he
[1:25:38] said it a couple of times many times as
[1:25:40] he's preaching this message he is saying
[1:25:44] never could the token
[1:25:47] message ever be
[1:25:50] preached till this time
[1:25:53] and then he would start talking about
[1:25:55] the power of the Holy Ghost well when I
[1:25:57] first came out of Pentecost I'm thinking
[1:26:00] what do you mean that the token could
[1:26:03] never be
[1:26:05] preached because I thought the Holy
[1:26:07] Ghost was the Holy
[1:26:09] Ghost I looked at the Son of God as but
[1:26:12] then when you find out that the Holy
[1:26:14] Ghost is this yeah it's the same holy
[1:26:17] ghost in
[1:26:20] justification that brought the plan into
[1:26:23] sanctification that brought it into
[1:26:25] speaking in
[1:26:26] tongues but that's not what he's got in
[1:26:30] mind he wants a people where the word
[1:26:35] has total control
[1:26:40] of he wants a people that the word can
[1:26:44] live it through
[1:26:51] them
[1:26:53] he wants to speak in tongues through you
[1:26:56] he wants to work miracles through you he
[1:26:59] wants to be justified through you he
[1:27:02] wants to be Sanctified through you but
[1:27:05] he wants preeminence through you he
[1:27:08] wants
[1:27:10] preeminence come on
[1:27:12] Church well he wants a
[1:27:15] preeminence in this bride amen a
[1:27:20] placing where he can look at you well
[1:27:23] praise the Lord amen I I I I don't want
[1:27:27] a baptism I don't want an emotion I
[1:27:32] don't want a feeling I want a ceiling of
[1:27:36] the Holy Ghost the same ones that they
[1:27:38] had at the beginning Ephesians 1:3 and
[1:27:41] whom also you trusted after you heard
[1:27:45] the word of Truth The Gospel of your
[1:27:47] salvation in whom also after you
[1:27:49] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[1:27:53] Spirit of Promise someone shout
[1:27:55] hallelujah which is the earnest of our
[1:27:57] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:27:59] purchase possession unto the praise of
[1:28:01] his glory can you say Amen so when you
[1:28:04] receive the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] today you are not receiving amen you're
[1:28:09] not receiving it in its in its in in its
[1:28:13] in just a portion form the holy spirit
[1:28:17] is on Earth today to baptize you with
[1:28:21] the full fullness of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:23] because this is the fullness of the word
[1:28:26] with the full hallelujah oh my I I I you
[1:28:30] know I I wish I wish I could let all the
[1:28:33] Pentecostals know and the denominational
[1:28:35] know what you got is wonderful but
[1:28:38] there's something that'll give you a
[1:28:39] reality there's a reality in the word
[1:28:42] there's a reality in Christ I want this
[1:28:45] church to know that the realities of God
[1:28:49] are at your fingertips here tonight
[1:28:52] you can be so full of the power of the
[1:28:55] Holy Ghost that he will live his very
[1:28:58] life through
[1:29:02] youall can you say
[1:29:04] amen amen Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the
[1:29:08] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:29:10] sealed until the day of your
[1:29:13] Redemption 2 Timothy 2:19 nevertheless
[1:29:16] the foundation of God standeth sure or
[1:29:18] stand sure having this seal God knoweth
[1:29:21] them that are is and let everyone that
[1:29:23] nameth the name of the Lord depart from
[1:29:26] iniquity can you say amen he says the
[1:29:30] Pentecost represented Mary Mary the last
[1:29:34] stage of it she was not the seed yet the
[1:29:39] life of the seed was in her but it
[1:29:41] hadn't matured yet I feel religious it
[1:29:45] hadn't matured yet it was there but it
[1:29:48] wasn't matured so it is with our
[1:29:50] Pentecostal age that we're living in
[1:29:53] there's got to come forth a word of
[1:30:03] God do you catch that now this was in he
[1:30:08] he preached this a man and the seed is
[1:30:12] not air with the
[1:30:13] shook there's got to come forth a word
[1:30:18] of God Amen UND denominational outside
[1:30:22] of the rims of that
[1:30:23] denomination
[1:30:25] Luther went to the husk with his first
[1:30:28] word the just shall live by faith Wesley
[1:30:30] had two two words
[1:30:33] sanctification second definite work of
[1:30:35] Grace Pentecost had the third work the
[1:30:37] restoration of the gifts but the entire
[1:30:41] seed has to come forth see they've
[1:30:45] denied denominated on one word or
[1:30:48] another word or another word can you say
[1:30:51] Amen
[1:30:58] now what what where you going brother
[1:31:00] wend where you going I want to tell you
[1:31:02] that when you
[1:31:03] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:07] today you're not receiving a portion
[1:31:11] like
[1:31:12] Luther a portion
[1:31:15] like Wesley a
[1:31:18] portion
[1:31:20] like ausa
[1:31:22] when you receive the Holy Ghost today
[1:31:25] that Revelations 10 could not happen
[1:31:29] until the seventh angel messenger was on
[1:31:33] Earth and ready to give that word that's
[1:31:37] right and when that anointing came it
[1:31:40] took now remember been bound Holy Ghost
[1:31:43] bound bound by denominational Rivers but
[1:31:46] it is to be released by the evening time
[1:31:49] message when the Holy SP Spirit comes
[1:31:52] down with an open book to that
[1:31:56] messenger
[1:31:58] sir he releases the Holy Spirit back
[1:32:03] into the church that's
[1:32:07] right
[1:32:09] yes Hallelujah don't let me sit in sit
[1:32:12] in this church and and and and and
[1:32:16] only expecting a little bit like the
[1:32:18] Pentecostals are
[1:32:20] getting the Holy Spirit has been
[1:32:25] released and if it's not working it's
[1:32:28] because denominational tears have crept
[1:32:31] back in true but the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:32:35] go back the message is already here we
[1:32:38] got to get serious with this message and
[1:32:40] we got to cut loose all of our
[1:32:42] denominational thinking and the Holy
[1:32:44] Spirit Will flow and manifest through
[1:32:48] our hearts and our lives and our
[1:32:50] homes
[1:32:52] well praise the lord it's like I've
[1:32:54] talked about you know the games and and
[1:32:57] that internet this
[1:32:59] morning I mean that kind of stuff should
[1:33:02] be so Elementary should be so far gone
[1:33:06] that that kind of stuff should be right
[1:33:08] here in sanctification I mean we're
[1:33:11] talking about down here that that that's
[1:33:14] that's
[1:33:14] sanctification amen what that that that
[1:33:18] we're we're we're we're a couple we're
[1:33:20] we're Three Ages above it
[1:33:22] right yes sanctification that's that's
[1:33:25] where we say no that's worldly no that's
[1:33:27] pulling me away no that's causing me to
[1:33:30] to to wander from the Lord no that's not
[1:33:32] helping my family that's under Wesley's
[1:33:42] age if the eagle has
[1:33:45] come and Has Lifted us
[1:33:49] up then the anointing
[1:33:52] of the holy spirit is here through that
[1:33:56] message to make
[1:34:01] us to make us s
[1:34:05] higher oh
[1:34:07] godah can you say
[1:34:10] Amen
[1:34:11] now
[1:34:13] Hallelujah now are are you hearing me
[1:34:17] that's what the holy spirit is to do now
[1:34:21] I I want y'all to catch this because
[1:34:23] true justification could never come
[1:34:28] until there was a true word
[1:34:32] token until the true word
[1:34:37] came we lived under Dogma we my opinion
[1:34:41] was just as good as
[1:34:43] yours I your opinion was about like
[1:34:47] everybody
[1:34:48] else's and the good thing about
[1:34:50] denominations amen I get to keep my
[1:34:53] opinion and you can start your own
[1:34:56] denomination but you can't do that with
[1:34:59] this
[1:35:00] word you can't do that in this bride God
[1:35:05] sends a messenger and you must line
[1:35:08] yourself up with that
[1:35:13] word I don't have a choice you don't
[1:35:16] have a choice you've been favored by God
[1:35:20] and you stand upon the word of
[1:35:24] God praise the Lord can you say
[1:35:28] Amen
[1:35:29] Now consume me
[1:35:32] Lord because if we don't get through the
[1:35:34] first
[1:35:36] process praise the Lord if we don't know
[1:35:40] how to identify
[1:35:42] sin and we don't know how the holy or
[1:35:45] how the devil has worked through the
[1:35:47] church under cover all these
[1:35:49] years brother you're going to be fol
[1:35:53] cuz the prophet ain't here to discern
[1:35:54] you every time you turn around and tell
[1:35:56] you get back in line hey hey hey turn
[1:36:01] off your phone
[1:36:04] hey we're playing no get Prophet ain't
[1:36:09] here because then you would be relying
[1:36:11] upon the prophet to tell you everything
[1:36:14] what to do instead of the spirit of
[1:36:16] Truth here lining up with what he's
[1:36:18] already given
[1:36:20] you
[1:36:24] you don't have to have the prophet here
[1:36:25] Discerning everything he's done open
[1:36:27] that book to
[1:36:34] you
[1:36:36] now the
[1:36:38] Pentecostals have got enough Holy Ghost
[1:36:41] to feel good in
[1:36:43] church to shout in
[1:36:46] church but brother Bram says they had a
[1:36:49] dip it was a dip
[1:36:52] they were
[1:36:53] Justified
[1:36:59] Sanctified and then 1906
[1:37:03] comes they're
[1:37:06] satisfied speaking in tongues and it was
[1:37:10] a wonderful work of
[1:37:17] Grace and it work for their time
[1:37:23] for me to sit around and say Luther
[1:37:25] didn't have anything that that'd be an
[1:37:28] idiot I'd be an idiot to say that Wesley
[1:37:30] didn't have anything come on I'd be an
[1:37:33] idiot to say 1906 didn't have
[1:37:37] anything but I'll be pretty wise to say
[1:37:40] there's a reason why Luther wasn't
[1:37:44] raptured it would be the spirit of
[1:37:46] wisdom to say there's a reason why
[1:37:47] Wesley wasn't
[1:37:49] raptured it would be the spirit of wisd
[1:37:51] wisdom to say h there's a reason reason
[1:37:54] that 1906 wasn't
[1:37:57] raptured hallelu come on now huh
[1:38:01] hallelujah amen and I want to say it's
[1:38:04] pretty wise for you and I to say don't
[1:38:08] let the lukewarmness of this age keep me
[1:38:11] from the life of God in my heart and
[1:38:13] keep me out of a Rapture don't let the
[1:38:16] lukewarmness of this age I'm not mad
[1:38:19] here tonight I I'm just preaching under
[1:38:21] I'm I I I I've got a burden and I I'm
[1:38:23] preaching hard amen I I I don't you sat
[1:38:27] here and claim to be a message and
[1:38:28] you're still living under a Pentecostal
[1:38:31] sensationalism thinking that you're
[1:38:33] going to make the Rapture because you
[1:38:35] play
[1:38:36] music thinking you're going to make a
[1:38:38] Rapture because you know you're you're
[1:38:40] the preacher son thinking you're going
[1:38:43] to make a Rapture because you know you
[1:38:46] you you've got all the message
[1:38:50] tapes
[1:38:52] that's all
[1:38:55] Pentecostalism
[1:38:58] denominationalism and I want the
[1:39:02] life the genuine life that has been
[1:39:05] released on this Earth through the
[1:39:07] opening of that
[1:39:09] book folks if you don't see if you don't
[1:39:14] see that Revelations 10 as the fullness
[1:39:16] of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the
[1:39:19] Holy Ghost himself the word coming of
[1:39:22] Christ then you're never going to buckle
[1:39:25] and say God fill me with that Holy
[1:39:29] Spirit that's
[1:39:35] right well glory to
[1:39:38] God Amen I should have stayed on my
[1:39:40] notes cuz these are a little bit nicer
[1:39:42] than what I'm feeling right now
[1:39:47] Hallelujah the holy ghost in the
[1:39:50] beginning was God God's stamp of
[1:39:51] reproval it was it was the seal until
[1:39:55] the day of redemption Luther didn't have
[1:39:58] that seal until the day of
[1:40:02] redemption no one's had that seal until
[1:40:05] the day of redemption until this evening
[1:40:09] time light oh come on now the dead of
[1:40:13] sin has been satisfied well glory to
[1:40:17] God the Deb of sin has been satisfied by
[1:40:19] both parties God and the
[1:40:23] believer sinner has met God's
[1:40:25] requirements of repentance accepting of
[1:40:28] the
[1:40:30] blood God has accepted the
[1:40:33] humble heart of
[1:40:35] faith in that
[1:40:39] blood and then God comes down and
[1:40:42] robes his
[1:40:45] son with the Holy
[1:40:48] Ghost yes sir
[1:40:51] brother bradam call it the
[1:40:54] robe of the Holy
[1:40:59] Ghost Oh Glory to
[1:41:02] God when we talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:41:05] robe and every time brother brenon would
[1:41:07] talk about
[1:41:08] it he would go back to
[1:41:11] Elijah
[1:41:13] Elisha and he would say
[1:41:15] Elisha as Elijah's leaving he Elijah's
[1:41:19] going and he looks to Elisha and he says
[1:41:21] do you have a request he says
[1:41:25] yeah I want a double
[1:41:30] portion of what you got he did not say

[1:58:06] Lord now I I I can I can hear you sa now
[1:58:09] brother Wendell I I don't know whether
[1:58:11] to shout or cry or smile or nod or I
[1:58:15] don't know what what I'm saying is God
[1:58:18] let do see the
[1:58:20] importance of what we've
[1:58:24] got don't you let this word just be
[1:58:28] intellectual this word is to make you it
[1:58:33] is to compel you it is to live its life

[1:59:02] me amen you're going to see that hey
[1:59:06] there's some cleaning up I need to do
[1:59:09] amen maybe maybe there's some stuff here
[1:59:11] that I need to get serious you know
[1:59:13] maybe I should go to an altar
[1:59:15] occasionally I know brother brandham
[1:59:16] says we don't have to but man
[1:59:20] I my lack of an altar ain't helping me
[1:59:23] out
[1:59:25] any so when I hear that from brother
[1:59:28] brandham saying well you don't have to
[1:59:30] have an
[1:59:31] altar amen well you know brother
[1:59:34] brandham was
[1:59:35] right the altar ain't going to do it and
[1:59:38] you sitting on your Pew ain't going to
[1:59:40] do
[1:59:43] it come on the altar does nothing for
[1:59:47] you and you sitting there like a night
[1:59:50] on the log listening to the preacher
[1:59:52] service after service knowing you need
[1:59:54] the Holy Ghost ain't going to help you
[1:59:56] neither
[2:00:00] right knowing the Rapture is upon us
[2:00:03] knowing that you've still got this
[2:00:05] carnal sinful nature that is against
[2:00:12] God so what's the problem it ain't this
[2:00:15] and it ain't your Pew and it ain't the
[2:00:17] preacher and it ain't the prophet
[2:00:20] that's
[2:00:21] right it's your Stony
[2:00:28] heart there's a lot of quotes on it look
[2:00:30] it
[2:00:31] up it's the Stony heart that feels like
[2:00:34] I'm okay is the reason why we don't ball
[2:00:37] at an altar and asking God to forgive us
[2:00:41] and to take the desire of sin
[2:00:44] away some of us just go from one thing
[2:00:47] to the other to the other and we never
[2:00:51] learn God delivers us from one thing
[2:00:54] we'll go right back to the other and
[2:00:56] we'll always end up in the same sess
[2:01:06] pool we're not
[2:01:08] in we're not
[2:01:11] here we're
[2:01:18] here
[2:01:22] if the internet took you down before
[2:01:23] it'll take you down again get away from
[2:01:32] it holy ghost is
[2:01:40] preaching
[2:01:43] am we got to want this more than we want
[2:01:47] anything else the anointing of this word
[2:01:52] will bring Deliverance if it is
[2:01:56] accepted now what is that son of man and
[2:01:59] what is that eagle and bride time and
[2:02:02] the seed and
[2:02:06] adoption that's the time the church is
[2:02:09] placed that's the time that the sun is
[2:02:13] thinking like God
[2:02:15] thinks that's the time that the enemy is
[2:02:20] thinking he's not under justification
[2:02:24] anymore he's not under sanctification
[2:02:28] anymore he's not satisfied with a little
[2:02:31] bit of an emotion
[2:02:32] occasionally this man's
[2:02:35] got the adoption Rob
[2:02:38] on and what this man says he thinks just
[2:02:42] like his daddy or he would have never
[2:02:44] got it come on he this adoption robe

[2:02:51] bradam says when you get the token
[2:02:53] you'll kick the TV out of your house and
[2:02:55] if he says you'll kick the TV out of
[2:02:57] your house when you get the token then
[2:02:58] that means you're going to kick the
[2:02:59] stupid phone out of your house amen oh

[2:05:00] anything the life that caus
[2:05:02] justification is the life that brought
[2:05:04] sanctification the life that brought
[2:05:06] sanctification is the life that made
[2:05:07] them speak in tongues and the life that
[2:05:09] makes them speak in tongues is the life
[2:05:11] that is maturing the bride today you're
[2:05:13] Justified you're Sanctified and you
[2:05:15] should be able to speak in tongues and
[2:05:17] prophesy and believe the nine spiritual
[2:05:22] gifts what it was here is what it is
[2:05:32] here but now we've adopted the
[2:05:35] ellite
[2:05:37] doctrine Theo Baptist Doctrine easy
[2:05:42] believism the campbellites believe that
[2:05:44] if he was baptized in Jesus name you're
[2:05:47] all okay where the Church of Christ
[2:05:49] comes
[2:05:51] from they don't well you better not
[2:05:53] speak in
[2:05:56] tongues Baptists believe that once you
[2:06:00] believe you've got the Holy
[2:06:03] Ghost that's the two doctrines that are
[2:06:06] prevailing in the message
[2:06:09] churches all I have to do is God send a
[2:06:12] prophet believe that God sent a prophet
[2:06:15] and I've got the Holy Ghost that's what
[2:06:17] the Baptist believe come on cites I got
[2:06:22] Justified I got baptized in Jesus
[2:06:27] name and Buddy you better not you speak
[2:06:30] in tongues in one of our churches we'll
[2:06:31] put you
[2:06:34] out
[2:06:37] what it's
[2:06:43] denominationalism I'm going to tell you
[2:06:44] the mo the the the critics are always
[2:06:46] going to mock that dead cold formal
[2:06:50] powerless icicle of a church is it going
[2:06:53] to stand for the power of God and the
[2:06:55] word will never live in them you're
[2:06:57] going to find all kinds of backbiting
[2:06:59] and you're going to find all kinds of
[2:07:00] fighting you're going to find all kinds
[2:07:02] of troubles because it's the Corinthian
[2:07:04] Church that knows nothing about their
[2:07:06] position in
[2:07:12] Christ someone say hallelujah
[2:07:16] hallelujah if our homes are full of
[2:07:19] backbiting we need a holy ghost
[2:07:27] baptism brother brandham says the
[2:07:29] invisible Union of the
[2:07:36] Bride this is a true picture of the
[2:07:38] modern church
[2:07:40] today neither does this modern Church
[2:07:42] want any of these here
[2:07:45] screaming and
[2:07:47] shouting tongu speaking acts 238
[2:07:50] youngans around her she doesn't want any
[2:07:53] of them whooping and crying and
[2:07:56] screaming amen
[2:07:59] hallelujah
[2:08:01] what now I I just heard brother Bram
[2:08:04] talk about in the token while ago
[2:08:05] brother W that that all of the shouting
[2:08:07] stuff just this
[2:08:10] emotional what are we going to do he's
[2:08:13] trying to get you to take all the
[2:08:15] work in the son of man age you're going
[2:08:18] to take it all
[2:08:22] yes and saying that you've got
[2:08:25] emotionalism is the sign of having the
[2:08:27] Holy Ghost is about as as is about as
[2:08:31] bad as someone sitting in a message Pew
[2:08:33] Bound by the devil and just as sober
[2:08:39] as you both ain't got a bit of the Holy
[2:08:42] Ghost because the devil has control of
[2:08:46] your life that's right
[2:08:54] good job brother
[2:08:58] wend he says why such a child would
[2:09:00] immediately be put out of her
[2:09:02] denomination they had one like that in
[2:09:04] one of their churches why they' throw
[2:09:06] her out right
[2:09:07] quick amen why you let such stuff that
[2:09:10] go on as this go along so you see she's
[2:09:14] pregnated with something because she's
[2:09:16] bringing forth members all the time but
[2:09:18] she don't want any of them screaming
[2:09:20] hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable
[2:09:22] creatures that she thinks they are it
[2:09:25] would certainly embarrass her it would
[2:09:28] ruin her in her educated ethical societ
[2:09:32] scientific Society Church that she
[2:09:34] belongs
[2:09:35] to and they would throw her out at the
[2:09:37] next Council she can't have it she don't
[2:09:40] want to be pregnated with the word
[2:09:42] because that is the only kind that the
[2:09:44] word can bring
[2:09:47] forth born of the spirit of God it has
[2:09:50] the spirit of God in it no intellectual
[2:09:54] Church joining
[2:09:56] creedo bobbed haired painted face there
[2:10:00] is no such a thing in it at
[2:10:03] all you don't find that in the word of
[2:10:06] God you find an oldfashioned Sanctified
[2:10:09] Holy Ghost filled child born of the
[2:10:11] spirit of God screaming hollering
[2:10:13] shouting and praising God can I hear an
[2:10:17] amen
[2:10:21] it will
[2:10:24] produce the works of
[2:10:31] Christ but the shouting can be
[2:10:35] manufactured the jumping can be
[2:10:38] manufactured speaking in tongues can be
[2:10:41] manufactured prophecy can be
[2:10:46] manufactured but we're living
[2:10:49] appear here with the son of
[2:10:52] man where he is to take full
[2:10:55] control and if he takes full control
[2:10:58] you're going to be acting like a mad man
[2:11:00] too I'm sure but when it's all said and
[2:11:02] done it's because there's something that
[2:11:04] is burning deep down in that
[2:11:07] Soul we don't all shout we don't all
[2:11:09] scream we don't all do it but I
[2:11:11] guarantee you that's the way they done
[2:11:12] it in the book of Acts they all came
[2:11:14] Mary had Mary had I know she she
[2:11:16] conceived without sensation but she came
[2:11:19] out of that upper room out the windows
[2:11:23] drunker than all get out speaking in
[2:11:25] other tongues so your Prophet said in
[2:11:28] many
[2:11:32] occasions praise the Lord am I doing all
[2:11:37] right
[2:11:40] token the token life of the son of man
[2:11:45] where the Holy Spirit has
[2:11:48] control of Our Lives now why would let
[2:11:52] me just stop right here why would any of
[2:11:57] us stop
[2:12:00] short of what is already on the earth
[2:12:04] for you to possess
[2:12:08] today why would any of us that no time
[2:12:12] in the last 2,000 years has the Holy
[2:12:15] Ghost been here in such a reality like
[2:12:18] this
[2:12:22] generation now do you want to know
[2:12:25] why when the real thing is setting

[2:25:15] tonight
[2:25:24] in this
[2:25:28] day to receive the Holy
[2:25:35] Spirit it it means
[2:25:44] that all the Lans
[2:25:50] all the leans that have been held
[2:25:52] against this
[2:25:54] church has been struck
[2:26:02] off every time a man would come up with
[2:26:05] his own opinion and attach it to the
[2:26:07] church it was another lean on it it was
[2:26:10] another lean saying you can't have
[2:26:13] it to have a lean on your property is is
[2:26:16] is is legal
[2:26:17] term you can own your house but if
[2:26:20] there's a tax lean against your
[2:26:23] property they can sell the house right
[2:26:25] out from underneath you and you you you
[2:26:27] own the house outright and they can sell
[2:26:30] your house out from underneath you
[2:26:31] because they've got a tax lean against
[2:26:39] you and what happened is Satan was
[2:26:43] attaching leans all through these all
[2:26:45] through these ages
[2:26:47] he's been attached in the
[2:26:50] leans man's opinion man's opinion man's
[2:26:54] opinion man's
[2:26:57] opinion it's been nothing but man's
[2:26:59] opinion there's all kinds of
[2:27:02] leans there's no
[2:27:04] way that we could live an overcoming
[2:27:06] life because we were under the Dominion
[2:27:10] of sin the word had no authority over
[2:27:15] us
[2:27:17] some of us will stand there and say ah I
[2:27:19] ain't going to come under no man
[2:27:21] Hallelujah and you're the biggest
[2:27:23] Pharisee there
[2:27:30] is you're the one that's holding to your
[2:27:40] opinions I'm not I'm just preaching here
[2:27:42] tonight I don't know who I'm preaching
[2:27:44] to but I'm preaching to somebody all
[2:27:46] right this ain't on my
[2:27:50] notes my abstract is I'm I want to read
[2:27:52] that to you but I had a few of these
[2:27:55] quotes
[2:27:57] scriptures Satan's had these
[2:28:02] leans he's had these Lings on
[2:28:05] us and that's the reason
[2:28:10] why that's the reason why we never could
[2:28:12] rise above it it's the reason why we go
[2:28:14] in circles that's the reason why we get
[2:28:15] victory for a while and then we come
[2:28:16] back around to the same old deal and we
[2:28:18] find out that we're just doing the death
[2:28:19] walk we find out that we are the Samson
[2:28:21] that's just going around in circles
[2:28:23] treading at the at the at the Mill of
[2:28:25] the Philistines we're just going in
[2:28:32] circles but the token life of the holy
[2:28:34] spirit in this day is God's
[2:28:38] abstract it's God sending the abstract
[2:28:43] to each one of us saying
[2:28:47] that all of the
[2:28:50] leans have been stricken
[2:28:54] off everything that Satan has held
[2:28:57] against us well Mama believe well Dad
[2:28:59] well but grandma said well but I I it's
[2:29:02] been struck
[2:29:08] off and the Holy Spirit runs the
[2:29:13] abstract the title opinion
[2:29:17] and he goes the abstract to the title
[2:29:20] and he goes and he searches it and see
[2:29:22] if there's any leans I don't care if
[2:29:24] there was a lean that was put on the
[2:29:25] house way way back there in great
[2:29:27] grandma's house or or whatever any kind
[2:29:30] of a lean and they and and and and and
[2:29:32] they go back and they do the title
[2:29:33] search and they and they go all the way
[2:29:37] back the Holy Ghost comes
[2:29:41] in and begins to deal with you and say

[2:30:05] blood of Calvary and you wash all that
[2:30:09] worm and you wash and sanctify me holy
[2:30:12] spirit's he's he's teaching you and then

[2:30:22] you with the Holy
[2:30:24] Ghost I'm going to fill you with the
[2:30:26] holy
[2:30:27] spirit that is God's abstract to the
[2:30:30] title once that seal has been signed
[2:30:33] that means there is nothing held against
[2:30:36] you that that when you receive the Holy
[2:30:38] Ghost let me just let me just and I'm
[2:30:41] closing amen but let me just read this
[2:30:43] to
[2:30:44] you he says God gave Abraham a promise
[2:30:47] Abraham believed God it was imputed unto
[2:30:50] him for righteousness but he sealed the
[2:30:52] Covenant by the Seal of
[2:30:53] circumcision God gives you a promise
[2:30:55] potentially that you'll receive it
[2:30:58] you're going to be raised up this body's
[2:31:00] going to be glorified with
[2:31:02] him at the end
[2:31:05] time but you see you have to have a
[2:31:07] clearance on that deed the clearance is
[2:31:10] when everything against it has been
[2:31:11] stricken off you've got the abstract to
[2:31:14] it you've got the seal it's yours
[2:31:16] everything on it belongs to you and when
[2:31:18] we believe on Jesus Christ to be our
[2:31:20] savior and repent and are
[2:31:23] baptized and come up to believe him God
[2:31:26] recognizes our repentance and our faith
[2:31:28] towards him and sends down the abstract
[2:31:31] the abstract is the Assurance it's the
[2:31:33] guarantee that everything that was ever
[2:31:35] held against you you thoroughly repented
[2:31:37] of Hallelujah the property is bought you
[2:31:40] hold the abstract for the
[2:31:43] Assurance let nobody try to put you off
[2:31:45] a land and say it doesn't belong to you
[2:31:48] with the abstract in your hand let him
[2:31:50] try to no law in the land can do it
[2:31:53] because you hold the abstract there's no
[2:31:56] devil there's no church or any theology
[2:31:58] that can overstep the boundaries of
[2:32:00] God's proof and Abstract that the
[2:32:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized
[2:32:05] us in Christ
[2:32:11] Jesus this token
[2:32:15] life it's the

[2:33:52] when I really don't have the power of
[2:33:53] God to
[2:33:55] overcome
[2:33:59] yep
[2:34:02] yep can both
[2:34:05] parties those that have the Holy Ghost
[2:34:09] Out have allowed junk in their life
[2:34:12] while the Holy Ghost has been sitting
[2:34:13] there telling you the whole time the
[2:34:14] Holy Ghost is there saying don't do that
[2:34:16] you shouldn't do that don't don't do
[2:34:23] that or the guy that doesn't have the
[2:34:25] Holy Ghost doesn't
[2:34:28] have he just he just he's just oblivious
[2:34:31] to anything he's just oblivious he's
[2:34:33] just oblivious he's just in
[2:34:35] life just going through life and he
[2:34:38] ain't got nothing correct in him he's
[2:34:40] just one thing after another and can't
[2:34:43] can't can't understand that there's
[2:34:45] devils in every one just he's just he
[2:34:48] needs the Holy
[2:34:59] Ghost for both of
[2:35:04] us I think that would include all of
[2:35:07] us those that need
[2:35:10] it and those of us that need a
[2:35:15] refilling
[2:35:17] there's plenty of
[2:35:19] blood and the mighty Angel is still
[2:35:24] here if you want
[2:35:29] it there's
[2:35:32] blood if you want the
[2:35:34] abstract the guaranteed to the
[2:35:38] resurrection it's
[2:35:40] here can you say
[2:35:42] Amen will you forgive me for keeping you
[2:35:44] so long
[2:35:50] I'm here with a burden
[2:35:59] tonight what can I do to give it get get
[2:36:01] the Holy Ghost brother
[2:36:03] wend you can get the Holy Ghost right
[2:36:05] now right there where you're
[2:36:14] sitting
[2:36:18] but most of the time it's got It's got
[2:36:19] to require sanctification that Stony
[2:36:22] heart being taken out and that new
[2:36:25] spirit that's wanting it there's where
[2:36:28] our problem is we go from
[2:36:30] justification and we wonder why we can't
[2:36:32] get the Holy Ghost is because we ain't
[2:36:34] got the the Second Step taken care of we
[2:36:37] have no desire we have no desire to
[2:36:40] overcome we have no
[2:36:42] desire so God has to take out the Stony
[2:36:45] heart
[2:36:46] put in a heart of
[2:36:48] Flesh so that you can receive his
[2:36:51] Spirit you got to want
[2:36:54] it it's got to be more important to you

[2:37:31] be at an altar nothing I'm using them as
[2:37:34] an as an illustration but I I

[2:37:40] keep us out of our position as the

[3:12:16] it's a scary thing
[3:12:18] to
[3:12:19] [Music]
[3:12:21] not when the spirit of the Lord moves
[3:12:23] like he has
[3:12:26] [Music]
[3:12:31] and these last few Services as we have
[3:12:34] been going through some of these things
[3:12:35] and if our hearts haven't
[3:12:39] been
[3:12:41] touched
[3:12:42] [Music]
[3:12:44] brother Brandon said in
[3:12:48] communion gave a
[3:12:50] [Music]
[3:12:51] very very Bleak
[3:12:57] assessment and those that feel like
[3:13:00] you're just content with where you are
[3:13:02] and that
[3:13:03] you I I I want you to really listen to
[3:13:07] this quote here
[3:13:11] I says the of hunger
[3:13:15] listen it's a great cry because it's a
[3:13:18] distressful cry when you're
[3:13:22] hungry you're you're screaming out I got
[3:13:25] to have something from the Lord cuz I'm
[3:13:27] lacking it I I'm
[3:13:31] hungry he says the person is
[3:13:34] dying he says oh if we could get to that
[3:13:39] place if this nation could get to a
[3:13:42] place to Where It's So Hunger for
[3:13:45] God it's in a worse starvation than the
[3:13:47] Nations like India that's starving
[3:13:50] physically this nation is starving
[3:13:52] spiritually but after you hunger so
[3:13:55] long it gets to the place that you don't
[3:13:58] know you're
[3:14:00] hungry just like freezing you after you
[3:14:04] get so far freezing and you get so cold
[3:14:08] then after a while you become
[3:14:11] warm and when you do you're
[3:14:15] dying that's what's the matter
[3:14:18] tonight churches have got so cold until
[3:14:21] they're
[3:14:22] freezing they think they're
[3:14:25] warm by membership and are dying
[3:14:28] spiritually dying don't know
[3:14:31] it finally he lays down to sleep and
[3:14:34] that's all of it he never wakes up no
[3:14:38] more because his blood is froze in his
[3:14:41] veins
[3:14:43] [Music]
[3:14:49] that's a that's a that's a pretty bleak
[3:14:53] picture if I was a young
[3:14:55] [Music]
[3:14:58] man and I don't have the Holy
[3:15:01] Ghost and I don't have that burning down
[3:15:04] in my
[3:15:07] heart I I I think I'd be going I'd be
[3:15:10] going home and busting up everything
[3:15:12] thing that's that's that's that's taking
[3:15:14] that desire away from
[3:15:19] me used to be would take would take the
[3:15:22] televisions out
[3:15:25] and shoot it with a shotgun or would the
[3:15:29] girls would
[3:15:30] take their
[3:15:34] dresses sister Carol you remember
[3:15:37] those pants burning parties
[3:15:40] and tight clothes burning parties we've
[3:15:43] had that's
[3:15:46] right holy spirit would get so convict
[3:15:49] them convict the hearts
[3:15:52] and I remember one time out
[3:15:56] here I think we met out at the lake we
[3:16:00] brought records there were records and
[3:16:02] CDs
[3:16:08] and pants that girls had hid and
[3:16:13] bunch of top
[3:16:16] clothes they said we're not going to
[3:16:18] keep them around to give them to
[3:16:19] somebody else where this this has been a
[3:16:22] trap for me and I'm not and we had a we
[3:16:24] had a part I'm talking about a burning
[3:16:26] party you remember that
[3:16:30] [Music]
[3:16:39] CA it meant something to us we wanted to
[3:16:42] get rid of
[3:16:45] junk I
[3:16:50] think back in those
[3:16:53] days it was records and CDs and
[3:16:56] cassettes and
[3:17:04] DVDs hard to burn these phones that
[3:17:06] aren't
