[30:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. I didn't really have anything
[30:58] planned to say. Um
[31:03] try not to. Uh, but all the services
[31:07] were really good.
[31:11] All the services were
[31:14] amazing. Um, I really got a lot out of
[31:17] all of them, but um, one of my favorite
[31:21] ones was like the last one. It just
[31:25] really spoke to me and I just, you know,
[31:29] I just
[31:31] I don't know. It just was different than
[31:33] all the other services. It kind of like
[31:38] I guess it gave me more understanding of
[31:40] you know what it is to be a Christian
[31:43] and stuff like that.
[31:46] But um it was it was a lot of fun and uh
[31:51] brother Nathan and all the preachers did
[31:53] amazing job in putting it all together.
[31:57] Um,
[31:59] the dorms were not very
[32:06] &gt;&gt; I like cars a lot, but um they were very
[32:10] loud though. It was it was it was fun
[32:14] though. It was a lot of fun.
[32:18] Yeah. Um but um they were just really
[32:22] amazing and you know
[32:26] when I went through the prayer line I
[32:28] really felt that God had really touched
[32:30] me in different areas that I was you
[32:33] know struggling with and stuff like
[32:35] that. But um you know they're just
[32:38] really amazing.
[32:41] [Applause]
[32:49] or any somebody else.
[32:54] Oh, we like that.
[33:00] All right. Well,
[33:03] I think uh my opinion is with the uh
[33:06] going to the camp every year, it just
[33:09] gets better and better. both the
[33:11] services and with the fellowship, it
[33:13] always gets better. I always come back
[33:15] with a a deeper understanding of the
[33:18] Lord and the message and just loving the
[33:20] Lord more and more. I think what I went
[33:23] to camp longing for most this year is uh
[33:27] I was recently going through a dry spell
[33:29] and I think what I was really needing
[33:31] was I needed a refilling of the Holy
[33:33] Ghost and I just wanted to feel the
[33:35] Lord's presence again. I was going
[33:36] through a dry spell and I hadn't really
[33:38] felt the Lord even in the services. So I
[33:42] was going there. I was wanting uh Holy
[33:44] Ghost and to be able to feel him again.
[33:46] Uh Thursday night, amazing service.
[33:50] Brother Andrew did an amazing job. I
[33:54] went up and got prayed for. Um got
[33:57] freedom from a couple little things and
[33:59] uh got the that refilling I needed. And
[34:02] then uh
[34:04] that uh Friday morning or Friday night
[34:08] was also really good. Brother Josh
[34:09] Bennett um he's not as much of a uh
[34:13] fireball as brother Andrew. Uh he he's
[34:16] still an evangelist, but his style is
[34:20] slightly more on the teaching side. So I
[34:23] really enjoyed that. Then I think my
[34:26] favorite service was the Saturday
[34:27] morning worship service, which wasn't
[34:29] even technically a service, but I think
[34:32] I enjoyed that the most. Just going in
[34:34] there worshiping the Lord. And uh I
[34:37] stayed after everyone was dismissed. I
[34:38] just kept worshiping the Lord. And I
[34:40] just felt the Lord's presence wash over
[34:42] me. Like you know that feeling when
[34:44] somebody pours a bucket of water over
[34:45] you, just feel the water go down you. It
[34:48] was like that except it wasn't cold and
[34:49] it wasn't wet. So
[34:52] yeah, I felt the Lord just wash over me
[34:54] like that and it was
[34:57] amazing. An amazing feeling. It's
[35:01] you can't describe how wonderful it is
[35:03] to just feel the Lord
[35:06] just basking in his presence was
[35:10] amazing.
[35:12] That Saturday night, I uh went through
[35:15] the prayer line and then after that, I
[35:18] went back to my seat and while I was
[35:19] there, I just got another little touch
[35:22] from the Lord. Was able to worship in
[35:23] his presence again. And the same Sunday
[35:26] morning, just more worship. And I think
[35:30] for me, this has probably been the best
[35:32] camp because
[35:34] I was just able to worship and bask in
[35:38] the presence of the Lord. And
[35:41] I just say I have grown to love him even
[35:44] more than I did before.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Uh God is good.
[35:55] That's why we uh so encourage every one
[36:00] of you young people to go to these.
[36:02] There's there's a lot of camps, but
[36:03] there's a few of them that we want you
[36:05] to go to, and that's that's one of them.
[36:08] Amen.
[36:09] Praise the Lord. Um, all right. The
[36:13] testimony. Somebody else.
[36:23] You and And you don't have to be a
[36:25] camper or you you can you can be an
[36:27] adult, too. I don't care.
[36:30] But you have to be there, Jesse.
[36:38] Amen.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know why you're making us get up
[36:44] here.
[36:46] Um
[36:48] I know that it, you know, it's a youth
[36:50] camp and it's all about the youth and
[36:53] um but I'm still a youth so I get to
[36:57] take my kids and it's such a blessing.
[37:00] And um like Luke said, I was really just
[37:04] um struggling a lot to feel the Lord.
[37:09] And
[37:11] I mean, there's times I could feel him
[37:13] still, but there's just that where you
[37:15] want to just be in his presence and feel
[37:17] him just pour over you. And
[37:21] um that's really what I got in these
[37:24] services. And it just hit me on Friday
[37:27] night. I was just like crying out to the
[37:29] Lord and just thanking him for feeling
[37:31] him that way again and realizing like
[37:35] what a blessing that is to me. That
[37:38] means more than healing in my body. It
[37:41] means more than everything because I
[37:42] know he's with me and
[37:46] it's just indescribable.
[37:49] With God, we can do anything. And um
[37:53] that was just so wonderful for me. And
[37:55] the sermons, the sermons were
[37:58] phenomenal. Sunday morning was just um
[38:01] like the cherry on top. And it really
[38:04] reminded me how
[38:06] um special and needful and powerful that
[38:09] our prayers for our family are. Um, so
[38:13] many times I kind of find myself getting
[38:16] into I guess just kind of
[38:20] um
[38:22] used to the way things are and I don't
[38:24] pray as fervently for my family who's
[38:28] not serving him. So that sermon meant a
[38:32] lot to me. um the services in general. I
[38:35] mean, the whole the whole time the Lord
[38:36] was just so um was just there and
[38:39] blessing all of us and and it's so
[38:42] wonderful to see our young people being
[38:44] blessed and um it just brings me so much
[38:47] joy and I was really really happy to be
[38:50] a part of it.
[38:53] [Applause]
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Hey, us older young people, we we need a
[39:01] renewing, too. Amen.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Uh so this was uh definitely a different
[39:09] camp than what I'm used to because this
[39:11] was my first time not being a camper.
[39:13] And so, uh, it's definitely like a whole
[39:16] new different feel to youth camp because
[39:19] I'm used to like you get to bed and
[39:21] you're going to bed with a bunch of
[39:22] screaming teenage boys and then you wake
[39:24] up with a bunch of screaming teenage
[39:26] boys and hanging out with those
[39:28] screaming teenage boys all day and then
[39:30] your time to relax is only at church.
[39:33] But, uh, it was it was a just good
[39:36] meetings. um you know they they gave me
[39:40] the privilege to play the drums on a few
[39:42] of the services. And so you know
[39:44] sometimes when you have those services
[39:46] where you play music a lot of times you
[39:48] you you know like you get into the
[39:50] service but you know that you still have
[39:51] your post of duty that you need to you
[39:53] know need to help out and but that
[39:55] Saturday night they normally last year
[39:58] uh I didn't play on Saturday. this year
[40:00] I didn't get uh that I didn't play on
[40:02] Saturday. And so going to that service
[40:05] just hoping, you know, the Lord just
[40:07] this was the service I really just want
[40:08] to just push through. I want to go into
[40:10] the prayer line and things. And there's
[40:11] a couple things that me and Rose were
[40:13] praying about. And uh I just feel like
[40:16] the Lord just gave us our answer. And so
[40:18] I just want to thank the Lord for that.
[40:21] [Applause]
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:29] Such wonderful. Amen. Sister was asking
[40:33] why why we're having y'all to testify
[40:35] because we're licking the honey off.
[40:36] Amen. Y'all been in the honey bucket.
[40:38] Praise the Lord. It Anyone Anyone else
[40:42] have have a testimony real quick? We
[40:44] don't want to drag it out. But if you're
[40:46] wanting to testify, then you need to
[40:48] testify. We want to hear you. Amen.
[40:53] Brother Devin or Yeah, Sister Len.
[40:56] Amen.
[41:06] Well, um, the services are really great.
[41:09] Brother Andrew and brother Josh did so
[41:11] good. Um, probably one that standed out
[41:14] to me the most was Saturday night. It
[41:16] just like made me feel
[41:20] like it was it was really good.
[41:23] um in the prayer line I went through him
[41:24] but um I felt over touch with the Lord
[41:27] and brother I've been claiming my the
[41:30] Holy Ghost I've been like wanting it
[41:32] really bad but then just certain like
[41:35] things told me just when it happened but
[41:38] um I went in and brother Josh
[41:41] he um um
[41:44] he grabbed a hold of me and he told me
[41:47] to like he claimed it and then he like
[41:50] rebuked the devil that was holding me
[41:52] against it and just talked to me and I
[41:54] believe that's when I really felt free
[41:56] and got the Holy Ghost. So, I came out
[41:58] claiming that and just seeing my friends
[42:01] um be delivered and get a touching was
[42:04] really good and great. So, yeah.
[42:08] [Applause]
[42:23] You think coming back from hundreds of
[42:25] people would be a lot easier to uh talk
[42:27] in front of
[42:29] uh 50, you know, but yeah, I'm still
[42:33] kind of nervous, you know. But um my
[42:36] testimony begins about like two weeks
[42:39] before Ohio camp. It was uh Ben Puit's
[42:43] meetings, you know, and I didn't even
[42:45] know why we was going there. I just woke
[42:47] up. Lois says we're going to Arkansas.
[42:49] you know, and uh
[42:53] and so
[42:56] on the way there, you know, I was
[42:58] listening to brother Andrew. What
[43:00] brother Andrew, what brother Andrew
[43:02] said, what what really stuck out was
[43:04] stop begging God and just believe it.
[43:06] And so, well, I come back. So, no, we
[43:10] don't come back. Uh we go we're in
[43:13] Arkansas meeting and you know you know
[43:16] Friday go by and then Saturday night you
[43:19] know what really stuck out you know
[43:22] brother
[43:23] uh brother Brandon was playing and you
[43:26] know it was deep call into deep it was
[43:28] playing on the screens and he was
[43:33] calling people up who wants the Holy
[43:34] Ghost has come up there and I was like
[43:37] man what you know they're kind of lucky
[43:39] you know living with the with, you know,
[43:41] in a prophet age where you can just go
[43:43] up there and you can get it. And so and
[43:46] and then I was thinking about that and I
[43:49] was waiting for Ohio to, you know, like
[43:50] get the Holy Ghost and I was like,
[43:52] "Okay, I'm going to get it in Ohio." And
[43:54] you know, but um but then something
[43:57] changed and I was thinking like I can do
[44:00] that today, you know, without even with
[44:03] the prophet you go you got God and so I
[44:07] was like man and then
[44:11] and then so I was like all right then
[44:14] this is the night and I was claiming it
[44:18] and uh and I was like I'm going to get
[44:20] it tonight. And so I went to the prayer
[44:23] line and And I was telling everybody,
[44:26] you know, telling my head, I was like,
[44:27] "I'm going to get it tonight. I'm going
[44:28] to get it tonight." And closer to the
[44:30] player line, you know, the devil was
[44:32] like, "You're not going to get it." You
[44:33] know, closer to it, you're not going to
[44:35] get it. But and I was fighting. I was
[44:37] like, "I'm going to get it." You know,
[44:39] and I got there and even make it past
[44:41] three preachers. I fell down and I felt
[44:44] everything. It came into me and I got it
[44:46] that night.
[44:51] [Music]
[44:54] And so, you know,
[44:57] you know, first day after that felt
[44:58] good. I was like, man,
[45:01] that was good. You know,
[45:03] and I was like, wow. And then, uh, next
[45:07] day after that, and I was, you know,
[45:09] devil came up. You're like, how do you
[45:11] really know you got it? You know, how do
[45:13] you know? And so it got so bad where it
[45:16] wasn't during night. I was crying. I was
[45:19] like, "Do I really have it?" And I was
[45:21] praying,
[45:23] you know, and we went to Ohio and I I
[45:26] was like, "I got to get delivered." You
[45:28] know, I know I have it, but you know, he
[45:30] just he kept on coming at me. He was
[45:32] like, "You don't have it."
[45:34] You know, I come back and then
[45:38] I don't remember what night it was or
[45:40] something. I don't know. But I felt God
[45:43] and and now I know I have it. you know,
[45:47] he has not been he hasn't been after me.
[45:50] You know, I haven't I believe with all
[45:52] 100% with all my heart I haven't and he
[45:54] hasn't,
[45:56] you know, come attack me ever since. So,
[46:02] [Applause]
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:10] Praise the Lord. Somebody else
[46:12] real quick.
[46:16] Amen. Sister Mary,
[46:19] we sure appreciate those who drove the
[46:23] bus.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; I just want to um say how thankful I am
[46:31] for, you know, camps like this that,
[46:37] you know, the Holy Ghost could just get
[46:38] completely free and touch our young
[46:40] people like like like it does. And um
[46:44] even the uh there had a snack shack and
[46:46] there's you know people that just work
[46:48] the the camp there and they're just
[46:51] saying how you know these young people
[46:52] are just so so different. You like there
[46:55] there's like the drinks that are on an
[46:57] honor system now. People come up and
[46:59] just you know oh I got this drinks I'm
[47:00] paying for it. You know they're like we
[47:02] don't see that. And I just say how proud
[47:06] I am of young people. And I know our
[47:08] young people aren't perfect and they
[47:10] have mistakes, too. But I'm just so
[47:14] proud of them and so thankful that I
[47:17] can, you know, have the place to take my
[47:19] kids to. So anyways, just want to thank
[47:22] the Lord.
[47:23] [Applause]
[47:33] They had got back with me, the the
[47:35] brothers up there that runs the camp,
[47:36] and they they were uh they were bragging
[47:39] on our group, say, "Man, you guys just
[47:42] got topnotch
[47:44] and so so glad to have Oklahoma." So,
[47:47] that was really nice.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:50] [Applause]
[47:56] have a testimony, brother Michael.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Hi.
[48:08] Um, you know, going going to camp, my
[48:12] wife was like, "Why do you always want
[48:15] to go to the youth camps?" You know, and
[48:17] I'm like, "Why not?" You know, I was
[48:19] like, "I'm I'm part of the original
[48:21] campers, you know. And um but I uh I
[48:25] like going to those youth camps and you
[48:28] know we we do get to see a lot of u I
[48:32] guess uh a lot of the campers that were
[48:35] around for some of these camps when I
[48:37] was in camp and now they have children
[48:40] and they're going to camp and and um the
[48:44] reason I like to the reason I like to go
[48:45] is because you know I just need I just
[48:49] got to be doing something you know I
[48:51] need to be doing something for the Lord,
[48:52] whether it's just whatever, you know,
[48:55] and um whether I can drive or whether I
[48:59] can buy a meal or whether I can pick up
[49:02] trash or uh or night guard. That's one
[49:05] of my favorites, you know, midnight
[49:08] garden. Get to try to catch little bad
[49:09] kids running around, you know. Um you
[49:12] know, doing things like that. And and
[49:15] then like to be able to be in service
[49:16] and be able to push during the services,
[49:18] you know. um you know because sometimes
[49:21] in youth services it can be a little
[49:23] clammy you know because everybody's you
[49:26] know afraid to mess up you know and so
[49:29] but um I really enjoyed being there
[49:31] because being there seeing you know
[49:35] Ohio's got a lot of people just hands
[49:37] down there's like there's like 1,200
[49:40] people in that church like whoa that's a
[49:42] lot of people you know and um and being
[49:45] there I don't feel I don't feel excluded
[49:49] But I feel like I'm a part of something,
[49:51] you know, and we're all part of
[49:52] something. Um, you know, they were
[49:54] talking about how that there was 66
[49:56] churches represented in that meeting and
[49:59] our church was included in that. You
[50:01] know, um, the youth that we have here,
[50:04] you know, I think that you should take
[50:05] advantage of those kinds of services
[50:07] because they'll be monumental. You know,
[50:09] they'll be something that you'll always
[50:11] remember. Um, like our brother was, you
[50:14] know, talking about receiving the Holy
[50:16] Ghost, you know, at at the camp and, uh,
[50:19] you know, now, you know, it's not just
[50:20] like me and the brothers that are here
[50:22] that are just in the camp, but our
[50:23] children that are in the camp now and
[50:25] seeing them really press and get into
[50:27] the service, you know, um, makes me feel
[50:30] good about the next generation that's
[50:32] coming that, you know, it's just not
[50:33] going to die with us, you know, so no
[50:36] pressure, you know, but, uh, but it's
[50:39] just not going to it's not going to just
[50:40] end with us and seeing and them, you
[50:43] know, uh, really latch on to the
[50:46] anointing and how brother Josh and
[50:49] brother, um, brother Josh Bennett and
[50:52] how brother Andrew Glover, you know,
[50:54] they were preaching it and they were
[50:56] preaching it like they would to adults,
[50:59] you know, and they were preaching it in
[51:00] the way that they had said it was. It's
[51:02] not a the message isn't there's not a
[51:04] young person's message. There's not an
[51:06] old person's message. This is just the
[51:08] message, you know, that's being
[51:09] preached. And to see the level that the
[51:12] even the younger is at that they can
[51:15] catch that kind of preaching tells me
[51:18] that the message in as a whole is being
[51:21] preached in a way that they un they can
[51:24] understand the tapes and they can
[51:26] understand you know the pastors are
[51:28] preaching it you know and that right now
[51:30] that we're you know just speaking with
[51:32] some of the brothers and just talking
[51:33] with some of the youth and things that
[51:35] we're in the middle of a big move at the
[51:38] moment. I feel like the Lord's really
[51:39] sweep sweeping across congregations and
[51:42] sweeping you being sweeping in churches
[51:44] and things and it's important for us to
[51:46] be be there you know and to really push
[51:48] that move you know to to have those
[51:51] those style of meetings and and also
[51:53] kind of you know looking at our youth
[51:55] meetings and things that we have that
[51:57] you know we're right on track you know
[51:59] we're not we're not just out there just
[52:02] kind of doing our own thing you know but
[52:04] we're we're right on the track with this
[52:05] with the preaching that we have and the
[52:08] way that the way that we're doing
[52:09] things, I feel like the Lord's, you
[52:11] know, being there vindicates what we're
[52:13] doing right here in Oklahoma, you know,
[52:15] it's just as profitable anywhere else.
[52:17] And to see everybody come together and
[52:20] just praise the Lord and and to see all
[52:22] the unity and just and to see, you know,
[52:25] the brothers and sisters just just being
[52:28] there and pushing for the move of God
[52:30] was really just a a help to me. And so,
[52:33] um, but yeah, I enjoyed my time there at
[52:35] the Ohio camp. So,
[52:37] [Applause]
[52:43] Praise the Lord, Sister Elelliana.
[52:47] Okay, so I'm not very good at this, but
[52:49] uh I just want to thank the Lord for his
[52:52] presence and
[52:55] being so good to me at the camp and um
[52:59] thank you for refilling the Holy Ghost
[53:02] and
[53:04] just the prayer line was so good and all
[53:08] the service is really good but brother
[53:10] Andrew said that um don't think of it as
[53:14] a prayer line but as a testimony
[53:16] And I went in there and I just thank him
[53:20] for freeing me from everything that the
[53:24] devil was telling me. And I just love
[53:27] him so much.
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Aren't these just wonderful testimonies?
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anyone else?
[53:47] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[53:55] All right. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[53:58] wonderful hand clap.
[54:05] Praise the name of Jesus.
[54:08] Well, we're we're so thankful to to know
[54:12] that the Lord is is is calling us and uh
[54:17] that his grace is upon us and he'll
[54:20] never leave us nor forsake us. And um so
[54:24] we appreciate all of you, you young
[54:26] people. Um let's let's stand to our feet
[54:29] here and we'll just do a little Bible
[54:31] study and um we're going to read here in
[54:34] the book of Psalms 119
[54:37] and um
[54:40] 97 and the 90 we'll start the 97th
[54:43] verse.
[54:47] Praise the Lord
[54:49] again. We appreciate the drivers.
[54:51] appreciate
[54:52] uh just just everything that that the
[54:55] Lord has um the Lord has done this past
[54:59] weekend. We also thank the Lord um for
[55:02] keeping those guys safe. They we had
[55:05] some tires go bad and so uh we're going
[55:08] to have to replace, you know, I guess
[55:09] those tires that dry rotted looked good.
[55:12] We had them inspected and everything and
[55:15] um we made it back but uh we're missing
[55:17] a little bit of rubber. Amen.
[55:21] But there in Psalms 119 and 97,
[55:25] oh how I love thy law,
[55:29] it is my meditation all the day.
[55:32] Thou through thy commandments
[55:36] has made me wiser than mine enemies,
[55:40] for they are ever with me.
[55:43] I have more understanding than all my
[55:45] teachers, for thy testimonies
[55:48] are my meditation.
[55:50] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[55:53] again, we thank you,
[55:56] Lord, for confirming hearts, for filling
[55:58] with the Holy Spirit. We thank you for
[56:01] your grace upon our young people, Lord,
[56:04] how we love them and how we love their
[56:07] parents. And we're so thankful, Lord,
[56:10] for the gift that you have given us
[56:13] through Jesus Christ. Now, Father, we're
[56:16] just asking that you would be with us as
[56:17] we uh uh teach a little bit out of your
[56:21] word and just ask that you would bless
[56:23] it. Anoint me and anoint uh the
[56:27] congregation, Father, in the name of the
[56:30] Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say
[56:32] amen?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[56:36] seated.
[56:37] Amen. I want to uh speak a little bit
[56:42] tonight on on the importance of the
[56:45] Bible and uh um Bible Bible reading and
[56:51] um because the devil's going to the
[56:54] devil's going to he he'll he he he'll
[56:57] whoop you around the stump um and and
[57:00] he's going to do it again. You know,
[57:01] I'll just tell you right now, the
[57:03] devil's going to fight you again and
[57:04] tell you that you don't have the Holy
[57:06] Ghost. And and it he does that to every
[57:10] one of us. I'm an elder. And now I see
[57:12] there's some people code. I don't know
[57:14] what that AC is on, but uh
[57:18] but I see a lot of ladies shivering
[57:20] here. Amen. So uh um
[57:25] so the Bible is is important. The word
[57:28] of God, our feelings change. They're
[57:31] going to go up and down, but the word of
[57:34] God is must be our absolute.
[57:38] And so, Brother Brandham would would
[57:40] tell us, "A Christian reads his Bible
[57:44] and he prays every day." Amen. Because
[57:48] God's word is of the utmost important to
[57:51] us. As we just read here, Amen. I I am
[57:56] uh your word, thy commandments has made
[58:00] me wiser
[58:02] than my enemy. So So Satan, this this is
[58:06] just saying that Satan can come at you
[58:08] with with every which direction, but the
[58:10] Bible has is such an incredible force
[58:14] that it can defeat any lie that Satan
[58:17] would bring against you. So, I want us
[58:20] to examine the Bible for just a few
[58:21] moments here this evening because it
[58:23] first of all, it tells us who God is and
[58:26] it tells us who we are.
[58:29] And and I I believe uh number one, we
[58:31] need to know what the Bible says. So,
[58:33] that's the reason why we need to read
[58:34] it.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You need to know that when
[58:37] your preacher is preaching that it's
[58:39] coming out of the Bible. Amen. We you'd
[58:42] never you never uh you never believe
[58:46] something just because it's from behind
[58:48] the pull pit. You you don't do that. You
[58:50] you believe it because it's in the
[58:53] Bible. There's too many people believing
[58:55] things that's behind the pull pit and
[58:57] and it's not even in the Bible at all.
[58:59] So we believe what we believe because
[59:03] it's found in the Bible. Amen. So the
[59:06] Bible is the is the believer's absolute.
[59:10] It's our It's our absolute. If it's in
[59:12] the Bible, it settles it. Your opinion
[59:15] don't matter anymore. My opinion don't
[59:18] matter anymore. If it's in the Bible,
[59:21] it's the end of discussion.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's that's just it's the absolute.
[59:25] Amen. All of our truth, all truth. Amen.
[59:29] Any truth that you have, everyone's got
[59:31] truth. So, Amen. Uh uh in in the world
[59:33] today, your truth is your truth and my
[59:35] truth is my truth. But a Christian's
[59:37] truth is based right here in in the
[59:40] Bible. So, so then then also we we want
[59:44] to get into the Bible to familiarize
[59:47] ourselves with the promises that God has
[59:50] given to us because this Bible is is
[59:52] supernatural. So, so as we as we look
[59:56] here for like this this evening uh that
[1:00:00] you you've got the you've got the two
[1:00:02] you've got uh two covenants. You've got
[1:00:05] the Old Testament. You've got the New
[1:00:08] Testament, which is covenants. You've
[1:00:10] got the Old Covenant, Amen, under the
[1:00:12] Mosaic law. Then you've got the New
[1:00:14] Covenant under grace through Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ. So you you you've got the Old
[1:00:20] Testament, which consists of the first
[1:00:22] five books is called the Penetuk. Uh and
[1:00:26] it and it's Genesis, Exodus, uh
[1:00:29] Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. This is
[1:00:31] the law. This is what this is what God
[1:00:34] gave Moses. Moses was not as you know
[1:00:38] Moses wasn't there when Adam and Eve was
[1:00:40] created. But Moses was a prophet that
[1:00:44] God revealed this to. So Moses was
[1:00:47] living many many many years after the
[1:00:50] fall. But the book of Genesis is a
[1:00:54] vision that God gave the uh the prophet
[1:00:58] Moses. Moses told us about the beginning
[1:01:01] of time. Moses told us uh uh about the
[1:01:05] uh uh uh uh the flood. Moses, this is
[1:01:09] all done uh through vision. God spoke
[1:01:13] through a prophet.
[1:01:16] And so, and then you've also got you've
[1:01:18] got the historical books. The Old
[1:01:20] Testament is is going to have um many
[1:01:23] books like Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2
[1:01:27] Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings. You're going to
[1:01:29] have Esther. You're you're going to have
[1:01:32] such books that that sort of gives a
[1:01:35] history of of the uh of the Jewish
[1:01:39] people. But it is also a type of what
[1:01:44] God was going to do. And we'll get into
[1:01:46] that a little bit further here in a
[1:01:48] minute. But it was like a it was like a
[1:01:51] living human uh canvas that God was
[1:01:56] going it was going to be a blueprint for
[1:01:58] what God was going to do through the
[1:02:00] message of grace. So So the law, the Old
[1:02:04] Testament was a type of that which was
[1:02:07] going to come in the future. And um and
[1:02:11] so then you've got the books of wisdom
[1:02:13] and and I love reading those. You've got
[1:02:15] Proverbs and uh you've got Ecclesiastes.
[1:02:20] These are these are uh words that were
[1:02:23] spoken from uh uh
[1:02:27] Solomon and and so there's a lot of
[1:02:29] things there. Then how many have you
[1:02:30] ever read the book of Psalms? Amen. The
[1:02:33] book of Psalms is is actually it's it's
[1:02:36] u it's it's a book of songs. These were
[1:02:39] these were songs that or or praises that
[1:02:42] that uh David would write and different
[1:02:45] ones would write. And so uh so we we've
[1:02:49] got that. Of course, you've got the the
[1:02:51] New Testament. Uh you've got your first
[1:02:53] four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[1:02:55] John. This is the account of Jesus, his
[1:02:58] birth. This is the account of his
[1:03:00] ministry. This tells about uh everything
[1:03:03] about about Jesus and his calling the
[1:03:06] disciples. Amen. Then you've got the
[1:03:08] book of Acts. The Acts that the book of
[1:03:11] Acts is is named that because it is the
[1:03:13] acts of the Holy Spirit through the
[1:03:16] church. So Jesus came. Amen. He paid the
[1:03:20] price. The Holy Ghost is poured out upon
[1:03:24] the church. Now God is not living in
[1:03:27] Jesus. He's living in you. Living in his
[1:03:30] church. And the church is fulfilling uh
[1:03:34] uh the same works that Jesus done. So,
[1:03:36] so when you look there in the book of
[1:03:38] Acts, you can see that the church is
[1:03:41] doing the same signs, wonders, miracles
[1:03:44] that Jesus was doing uh when when he
[1:03:47] come in those first four gospels.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; So, so you you can see that then then
[1:03:52] you've got your other books. The Apostle
[1:03:54] Paul is the one who wrote uh who who
[1:03:57] wrote the the basic the the New
[1:03:59] Testament. um he wrote most of the books
[1:04:02] and the teachings and and dividing law
[1:04:05] from grace and and and and bringing a
[1:04:08] lot of those kinds of things out. So the
[1:04:10] Bible is is an incredible it's an
[1:04:13] incredible book and I think it's so
[1:04:16] important that we get established with
[1:04:20] reading this book and I want to
[1:04:22] encourage everyone that is here uh not
[1:04:25] just the young but I want to encourage
[1:04:27] everyone amen to make let's let's make a
[1:04:30] note let's read the Bible clean through
[1:04:34] amen let's let's set it on our calendar
[1:04:36] from from today on and this by this time
[1:04:39] next year, have the Bible read all the
[1:04:43] way through now. And and and you say,
[1:04:45] "Oh my, that that's that's that's going
[1:04:46] to be hard." You've got the apps on your
[1:04:49] phone these days. It will it will tell
[1:04:52] you exactly what and how to do it.
[1:04:55] They'll give you the scriptures to where
[1:04:57] you can have your your your uh uh the
[1:05:01] Bible totally read in one year. So, I
[1:05:05] think it's important. You say, "Well,
[1:05:06] the Old Testament doesn't I don't I
[1:05:08] don't know if we need to read the Old
[1:05:09] Testament." The Old Testament is very
[1:05:11] important. The Old Testament was the
[1:05:14] blueprint for what God was going to do
[1:05:17] in the New Testament. It was a type of
[1:05:21] what, amen, God was going to do for
[1:05:23] real. So, so I think I think it's
[1:05:26] important. Now, the Bible is more than
[1:05:30] than a book of systems or moral codes.
[1:05:34] Now we do get our moral codes from here.
[1:05:37] We we get our uh uh we we we get our
[1:05:41] history from it. Amen. Uh but but the
[1:05:44] but the Bible is not altogether a book
[1:05:46] of history. We we get our theology from
[1:05:50] it. But but um but it's not a book of
[1:05:53] theology. The Bible is a living it's the
[1:05:58] living logos. It's the living word. It's
[1:06:01] the revelation of the invisible God.
[1:06:04] Now, this is what God thinks about his
[1:06:06] word. There in Matthew 4:4, he says,
[1:06:10] "And he answered and said, it is
[1:06:12] written, man shall not live by bread
[1:06:16] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[1:06:21] out of the mouth of God." Everybody say,
[1:06:24] "But by every word,"
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; word
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; that proceeds
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; proceeds
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; out of the mouth of God. Amen. So, God
[1:06:32] gave us his word for a specific purpose.
[1:06:36] I want you to look and think about the
[1:06:38] power of scripture. Sister Keys, if you
[1:06:40] would bring up uh Revelations 1 and3.
[1:06:43] Let's listen to this. It says, "Blessed
[1:06:46] is he that readeth and they that hear
[1:06:51] the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:06:54] those things that are written therein,
[1:06:56] for the time is at hand."
[1:06:59] So you and it's not just something for
[1:07:02] us to hold on to, but when you read the
[1:07:05] Bible, you are blessed. When you hear
[1:07:08] the Bible, so Amen. If you've got a if
[1:07:12] you've got a a phone app, you you can
[1:07:14] you can listen or you can or you can
[1:07:16] read it. Amen. Even for you elders that,
[1:07:19] you know, maybe your eyes are getting a
[1:07:21] little bit dim, hey, you can you can
[1:07:22] turn it on and and and listen. So
[1:07:25] everyone, there's not an excuse. You're
[1:07:27] blessed whether you hear it or whether
[1:07:29] you read it. It is a blessing. Amen.
[1:07:32] Now, uh, of course, many in the Old
[1:07:35] Testament could not read. And so, uh,
[1:07:38] uh, the priests would read the Bible to
[1:07:40] them, and they were just as blessed to
[1:07:44] hear it as they were to read it. Amen.
[1:07:47] there there in there in um Revelations
[1:07:51] 22:18,
[1:07:53] the Bible says that if any man would
[1:07:55] take away from the Bible or add to the
[1:07:59] Bible, you're under a curse. So if you
[1:08:03] hear it or read it and do it, you're
[1:08:07] blessed. But if you take away from it or
[1:08:11] you say, "Well, it don't matter." Then
[1:08:14] you're under a curse. So, so this Bible
[1:08:16] is really important to us. Amen.
[1:08:18] Revelations 22:18. For I testify unto
[1:08:21] every man that heareth the word of the
[1:08:24] prophecy of this book. If any man shall
[1:08:27] add unto these things, God shall add
[1:08:31] unto him the plagues that are written in
[1:08:34] the book. And if any man shall take away
[1:08:36] from the words of this prophecy, God
[1:08:39] will take away his part out of the book
[1:08:42] of life, out of the holy city, and from
[1:08:45] the things that are written in the book.
[1:08:48] So if you are deliberately going against
[1:08:51] the Bible, Amen.
[1:08:54] Hallelujah. If God says for a woman not
[1:08:57] to wear pants, and you wear pants,
[1:09:00] you're under a curse. If you're cutting
[1:09:03] your hair, ladies, and the Bible says
[1:09:06] not to, you're under a curse. You say,
[1:09:09] "Well, you know, God just not a god of
[1:09:12] curse." You're all cursed. We're all
[1:09:17] under the curse. God's given us his word
[1:09:21] to take the curse away from us and to
[1:09:24] bless us. It's not God going to send you
[1:09:28] to hell. you're going to go to hell
[1:09:31] because you're a sinner.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; But God gives us his word so that we can
[1:09:37] come under that grace. Are y'all
[1:09:39] understanding that? So, so it's all it's
[1:09:41] all in whether we want to submit to God
[1:09:44] or rebel. If you want to rebel against
[1:09:48] the word, you're a loser. If you want to
[1:09:52] accept the word, you're a winner.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; I say, "Let me be a winner.
[1:09:59] Now, so how how many believe it's just
[1:10:01] that simple? Brother Brandon would
[1:10:03] explain it this way. He say, "Now you
[1:10:05] know why it says anyone who reads or
[1:10:07] even hears it is blessed. It is the
[1:10:10] revelation of God that will give you the
[1:10:14] authority over the devil." You can see
[1:10:18] why they who would add or take from it
[1:10:22] would be cursed. It would have to be so
[1:10:25] for who can add or take from the perfect
[1:10:28] revelation of God and overcome the
[1:10:31] enemy.
[1:10:33] It's that simple. There is nothing of
[1:10:36] such prevailing power as the revelation
[1:10:41] of the word. Are are you catching that?
[1:10:44] So if I'm going to win and and and and
[1:10:48] the devil's going to fight every one of
[1:10:49] you kids and and he's going to fight us
[1:10:52] all. Amen. whether we've got the Holy
[1:10:53] Ghost or whether we don't have the Holy
[1:10:55] Ghost. He's going to tell us and he'll
[1:10:56] beat us around the stump on our
[1:10:58] feelings.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; But you see, the word is our absolute.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; The word's our absolute. It doesn't
[1:11:06] matter what I feel. It's what God's word
[1:11:08] says. And if God's word says, "I'll
[1:11:10] never leave you nor forsake you," that
[1:11:12] settles it for me.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; If God's word says, Amen, that if I
[1:11:16] adhere to his word, I'm under his
[1:11:18] blessing, then Satan, I don't care what
[1:11:20] you say. You can you can flap your jaws
[1:11:23] all you want to. This is my absolute.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care about my daddy. Don't care
[1:11:29] about my mama. It don't care about my
[1:11:30] grandpa. Don't care about this preacher
[1:11:31] or this one or that or my opinion. My
[1:11:33] opinion don't matter. I have I have
[1:11:35] surrendered everything to what this
[1:11:38] says. And I want to know what this says
[1:11:41] because I want to be blessed.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody say I want to be blessed.
[1:11:48] How many want your marriage to be
[1:11:50] blessed?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; How many wants your children to be
[1:11:53] blessed?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only a few of you. How
[1:11:56] many want your marriage to be blessed?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; How many wants your children to be
[1:12:00] blessed?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; How many want your parents to be
[1:12:03] blessed?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; How many wants your parents to be
[1:12:07] blessed?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] Now, so this is this is incredible. Now,
[1:12:16] I'm I'm I I'm want to just take a
[1:12:18] hopefully just another 15 minutes. This
[1:12:20] Bible is not a regular book. Again, it's
[1:12:26] not it's not theology. It's not it's
[1:12:29] it's not a um um it it's not like a how
[1:12:36] would I put it, man? Um,
[1:12:39] you know, you you could you could write
[1:12:41] a you could write a book uh um that
[1:12:45] would um
[1:12:48] well
[1:12:50] let let me just Okay, so the Bible is is
[1:12:54] um is comprised of 66 books.
[1:13:00] So this Bible has 66 books new and old
[1:13:05] uh covenant.
[1:13:07] There are 40 writers
[1:13:10] in this in this Bible. So there are 40
[1:13:14] men who wrote books for from Genesis to
[1:13:19] Revelation. This Bible was written over
[1:13:23] a period of 1600 years. That's 1,600
[1:13:30] years from start to finish is how long
[1:13:34] it took to write this Bible.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; All right, everyone say it with me. 66
[1:13:39] books,
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; 40 writers,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; 1,600
[1:13:47] years.
[1:13:52] And when they canonized it, when they
[1:13:55] put it all together and put the the the
[1:13:57] the binder around it,
[1:14:02] there was not one contradiction from the
[1:14:06] start to the end.
[1:14:11] In the Muslim, in the Muslim world, the
[1:14:14] man Muhammad wrote the book. He wrote
[1:14:19] the Quran. That is one man
[1:14:24] in his lifetime
[1:14:26] writing the Quran.
[1:14:28] In the Mormon movement, there was one
[1:14:31] man,
[1:14:33] Joseph Smith, who wrote uh uh the the
[1:14:38] what is that book anyway?
[1:14:41] The Book of Mormon. Hallelujah. And and
[1:14:43] there was so all of these these all of
[1:14:46] these religions, one man, one writer,
[1:14:50] one lifetime.
[1:14:55] Our our religion, the Christian
[1:14:58] religion,
[1:15:00] 60 books,
[1:15:02] 1,600 years,
[1:15:05] 40 writers,
[1:15:11] Come on.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Let's Let's think of
[1:15:14] this.
[1:15:16] We Let's just say let's just say you
[1:15:18] what what what has what transpired in
[1:15:21] 1,600 years? Can you get somebody that
[1:15:24] wrote 1,000 years ago to agree with
[1:15:27] somebody who was writing something
[1:15:29] today?
[1:15:31] Okay, let's just let's let's just put
[1:15:32] it. Okay. 150 years ago,
[1:15:36] there were no cell phones.
[1:15:39] 150 years ago there was no cars.
[1:15:43] 150 years ago there were no rockets.
[1:15:46] There were no jet airplanes.
[1:15:48] 150 years ago uh uh uh
[1:15:52] man we were stuck we were stuck with a
[1:15:57] horse and buddy
[1:15:59] now.
[1:16:02] So, a man that was writing 150 years ago
[1:16:07] would not know how to even halfway
[1:16:11] understand a guy that is living today.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; He don't know.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Are y'all hearing me?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; So, so, but but I'm not I'm not talking
[1:16:21] about 150 years. Let's go 150 years plus
[1:16:23] 150 years plus 150 years plus 100. Are
[1:16:26] are y'all I mean, we're we're we're
[1:16:28] going way back here now.
[1:16:31] And when the Bible all come together,
[1:16:35] they all agreed. Brother Merrl, these
[1:16:39] men did not even know each other.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That one's already been dead. They're
[1:16:44] all dead. No one ever met each other.
[1:16:47] And yet, when the Bible when all their
[1:16:50] writings were put together, they were
[1:16:53] all saying the same thing.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Why am I making a big deal about this?
[1:17:00] Because the Bible is a supernatural
[1:17:04] book. It was written by God.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Men didn't write the Bible.
[1:17:16] Hallelujah.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:17:21] if you if you were to look Amen. The
[1:17:24] Bible, the Bible says, now here's here's
[1:17:27] the re here's the accuracy and I want
[1:17:28] you to understand
[1:17:30] God. The Bible says in f first John or
[1:17:33] just put John 1 and one. In the
[1:17:35] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:17:39] with God. The word was God. So in the
[1:17:44] beginning was the word. The word in the
[1:17:48] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:17:51] with God. The word was God. But yet the
[1:17:54] Bible wasn't wrote in the beginning.
[1:17:57] It was the living word
[1:18:00] or it was it was it was the the the the
[1:18:05] invisible word, the invisible God. It
[1:18:08] was God himself. In the beginning was
[1:18:10] the word. The word was with God. The
[1:18:12] word was God. God is a living word. In
[1:18:16] other words, God knows the beginning
[1:18:19] from the ending. Anything that you can
[1:18:22] put together, God sees in the very past.
[1:18:24] God sees in the very Nothing is new to
[1:18:27] God.
[1:18:29] God is all knowing.
[1:18:34] So we we refer I don't know what you
[1:18:36] kids refer to these days in school, but
[1:18:38] we we refer to everything in Webster.
[1:18:40] You'd have to go to Webster. You know
[1:18:42] Webster, the dictionary.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God was the God was the
[1:18:47] first Webster. God knows it all. God,
[1:18:50] every word, every event, everything, God
[1:18:54] has seen it from the beginning to the
[1:18:56] ending.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the Bible says
[1:19:03] there in the 14th verse, "And the word
[1:19:07] was made a man." If you'd put that up
[1:19:10] there, verse uh, "And the word was made
[1:19:13] flesh."
[1:19:14] the word, that invisible word that knows
[1:19:18] all things.
[1:19:20] He knew you millions of years before you
[1:19:22] got here. He knew this church would be
[1:19:24] He knew you'd be sitting right here and
[1:19:26] he knew you'd be picking your your your
[1:19:28] your neck right now. He's seen that
[1:19:31] millions of years ago. And I'm not
[1:19:32] picking on you. I'm just saying God seen
[1:19:34] it. God seen you scribbling on your
[1:19:36] little tablet right there. See that?
[1:19:39] That's God seen it. God seen you looking
[1:19:41] at her saying
[1:19:43] see God seen God knew nothing's by
[1:19:47] accident. God seen every knat every time
[1:19:52] it bats its eye. God knows it all before
[1:19:56] there was ever a world.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; He's the word. He's all knowing. He's
[1:20:06] all sufficient.
[1:20:10] And God has been so good
[1:20:14] to take out of that invisible rim of all
[1:20:18] knowingness
[1:20:20] and to bring it down in pages so that
[1:20:24] human beings
[1:20:26] can know what he knows.
[1:20:28] The one who sees it all, knows it's
[1:20:31] coming, knows all about the devil, knows
[1:20:34] what the devil's going to try in every
[1:20:35] which direction.
[1:20:37] And God puts it
[1:20:40] right here
[1:20:42] so that we can have a perception
[1:20:46] of what God does.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Now, how does he do it? He has to have
[1:20:52] specially built men. The Bible was
[1:20:56] written by prophets.
[1:20:58] The Bible says, let's let's let's look
[1:21:01] here in uh am I doing okay so far?
[1:21:06] The the Bible says there in second Peter
[1:21:08] 1:20,
[1:21:09] he says, "Knowing this first that no
[1:21:12] prophecy
[1:21:14] of scripture is of any divine
[1:21:16] interpretation."
[1:21:17] In other words, I can't say, "Well,
[1:21:20] well, well, I I I I believe it's like
[1:21:22] this." And you say, "Well, I believe
[1:21:24] it's like this." No, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:21:25] no, no. You're not the word.
[1:21:30] You're not the all knowing.
[1:21:33] God's the logos. God's the all knowing.
[1:21:38] Isn't that you? You can't wrap your mind
[1:21:40] around it. So we don't have any
[1:21:43] interpretation coming. We believe what
[1:21:46] the Bible says.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, so let's read it. Knowing
[1:21:52] this first that no prophecy of the
[1:21:55] scripture is of any private
[1:21:56] interpretation. For the prophecy came
[1:21:59] not in old time by the will of men, but
[1:22:03] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[1:22:08] upon by the Holy Ghost. We went through
[1:22:10] that this last Sunday. What was that
[1:22:11] Holy Ghost? Amen. That was the breath of
[1:22:14] God. That was that living word. That was
[1:22:17] that anointing, that messiahic anointing
[1:22:20] upon the earth. Now, amen. So, so, so
[1:22:24] you understand what I'm saying? there
[1:22:26] there are approximately 2500
[1:22:30] prophecies in the Bible. Now you go look
[1:22:33] at these other other prophecies. I know
[1:22:36] I know Muhammad was a uh was a prophet
[1:22:39] and um you know there was there you know
[1:22:42] Mormon was a prophet and there was you
[1:22:44] know that we we've got all of these
[1:22:45] things here but we're talking about and
[1:22:48] and and to each their own what whatever
[1:22:50] I you know if they were prophets we but
[1:22:53] this here is 25 over 2500
[1:22:58] prophecies
[1:23:00] that we're not saying one of these days
[1:23:04] something no we're talking about
[1:23:06] prophecies where God would come down
[1:23:10] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[1:23:12] things would happen and would prophesy.
[1:23:14] There are events taking place right now
[1:23:16] that was prophesied thousands of years
[1:23:20] ago
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; by his prophets.
[1:23:24] I would tell you right now, if you're
[1:23:27] going to be a winner,
[1:23:29] it would be a good thing for us to read
[1:23:31] the Bible every day
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and be serious about it and say, "Lord,
[1:23:37] I want to know. I want to know." Amen.
[1:23:41] So, now we we've we so we can we can see
[1:23:46] those things. Now once again, if we were
[1:23:49] together, medical books written by 40
[1:23:52] different doctors over the span of 1600
[1:23:57] years, do you think all those medical
[1:23:59] doctors would agree?
[1:24:03] I was reading in history yesterday. Uh I
[1:24:06] I I I was reading in history. Do you
[1:24:08] know Do you know what killed
[1:24:11] George Washington?
[1:24:14] George Washington,
[1:24:16] you know, he was he was in he was in
[1:24:17] great health and uh uh you know, he it
[1:24:21] was it was a cold cold winterry day and
[1:24:24] and he had to get out and do some chores
[1:24:26] and and and uh well, they said he didn't
[1:24:28] want to uh you know, he had that they
[1:24:30] were going to go to a dinner later on
[1:24:32] and he didn't want to change his clothes
[1:24:33] and then so he just kept his clothes
[1:24:35] clothes on for a little bit and and and
[1:24:37] uh uh you know, for to the road to the
[1:24:40] dinner and this that and the other.
[1:24:41] Well, they get home and he's feeling
[1:24:42] he's feeling bad and and and he's and
[1:24:44] he's telling his wife and and so you
[1:24:46] know what they done? They bled him. They
[1:24:50] cut the what they call bled. They cut
[1:24:53] him
[1:24:55] and and made blood come out of because
[1:24:57] this is the how because he was he he had
[1:25:00] some kind of a pneumonia or something
[1:25:02] and so they were going to try to get the
[1:25:03] stuff out of his blood.
[1:25:05] They said that that that his uh uh
[1:25:09] whoever was there cut him and and and
[1:25:13] and uh so that he could feel better. And
[1:25:15] then when the real doctors got there,
[1:25:16] they cut him some more. They said he
[1:25:19] lost 40% of his blood.
[1:25:24] And this was by the best doctors in the
[1:25:27] country.
[1:25:29] Well, he died eight hours later. I
[1:25:31] wondered what from.
[1:25:33] Right.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; So, so they were trying to cure
[1:25:37] pneumonia by bleeding. Now, this
[1:25:41] this is only a couple hundred years ago.
[1:25:44] We're not talking about 1600. We're
[1:25:46] talking about a couple too, right? You
[1:25:49] think that our science that our doctors
[1:25:51] today would agree with? Do you think if
[1:25:53] that doctor wrote a book
[1:25:56] that bled him and the doctors has been
[1:25:59] writing book for the last 200 years,
[1:26:01] would they agree?
[1:26:03] No. Because they're growing in
[1:26:06] knowledge. God is the word. There is no
[1:26:11] growing in knowledge. He is all knowing.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; He's everliving.
[1:26:19] He knows the beginning from the end. God
[1:26:21] is not a word on a book. He's living
[1:26:25] word. He knows all things. He's
[1:26:28] everywhere
[1:26:31] through his divine understanding.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] How about science? You think science
[1:26:40] would change? I wonder what science
[1:26:41] would have been back 150 years ago when
[1:26:44] all the all we had was donkeys and cows
[1:26:46] and horses and and buck boards.
[1:26:49] You think those scientists would agree
[1:26:51] with our scientists today?
[1:26:54] But our Bible,
[1:26:58] 40 men,
[1:27:00] 66 books,
[1:27:02] 1600 years,
[1:27:05] and they all say the same thing.
[1:27:08] I say word bless.
[1:27:11] Now,
[1:27:14] now it's it's it's incredible
[1:27:17] because when you read the Bible,
[1:27:20] it all has one message. One message. The
[1:27:23] Bible from front to the back is one
[1:27:25] message. Any Can anyone tell me what the
[1:27:28] message is? What is the message?
[1:27:31] Redemption.
[1:27:33] Redemption is its message. Brother
[1:27:36] Brandham says, "If you can't see Jesus
[1:27:39] from the front of the Bible to the back
[1:27:41] of the Bible, you need to go back and
[1:27:42] read again." Then he goes down about
[1:27:44] five minutes later and he says, "If you
[1:27:48] can't see yourself
[1:27:50] in the Bible from the start to the end,
[1:27:55] you need to go back and read it again."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; The purpose was redemption. So the
[1:28:02] Bible, when you're reading the Bible,
[1:28:04] don't just got to read. I'm going to try
[1:28:06] to get this done in a year. No, no. This
[1:28:09] is all about who you are, who God is,
[1:28:12] and what he's wanting you to know about
[1:28:14] him. The prophet of God says when we
[1:28:16] read when we read the Bible, we our our
[1:28:19] number one prayer should be revelation.
[1:28:21] Lord, reveal yourself to me.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Open my eyes. I'm just a human. I can't
[1:28:27] remember what I can't remember what
[1:28:29] happened yesterday. And I sure don't
[1:28:31] know what's going to happen tomorrow. So
[1:28:32] God may
[1:28:35] I I need your help. I need your help for
[1:28:39] me to understand this supernatural book.
[1:28:43] So we pray and that's why we need the
[1:28:44] Holy Ghost is to ask the Lord to help us
[1:28:47] in in in this regard. Now so so you
[1:28:51] remember Jesus was the Christ. Jesus was
[1:28:55] the logos. Jesus was the living word
[1:28:59] embodied.
[1:29:01] Okay? Jesus had a time where he was
[1:29:04] born. Jesus had a time when he left the
[1:29:07] earth.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; The Christ, the logos, the Messiah, the
[1:29:13] living word, never had a beginning nor
[1:29:15] an ending.
[1:29:18] So that logos that came upon Christ,
[1:29:23] Amen. that great pillar of fire. That's
[1:29:26] the reason why Jesus would say when he
[1:29:28] appeared to the Apostle Paul and and and
[1:29:30] now you know he when he when when when
[1:29:32] when the light appeared to Paul and and
[1:29:34] Paul says who art thou Lord who art thou
[1:29:36] Jehovah and then and and and Jesus and
[1:29:39] the pillar of fire answers back I am
[1:29:41] Jesus because once the pillar of fire
[1:29:45] come into the body of Jesus Christ it
[1:29:48] was now uh uh uh synonymous with Jesus.
[1:29:52] So now any time that you would see that
[1:29:54] pillar of fire, you can say Jesus. But
[1:29:56] the the Christ, the anointing has been
[1:30:01] here from ages to ages.
[1:30:03] Are y'all catching me? So when the Holy
[1:30:06] Ghost comes upon the church today, it's
[1:30:10] that same pillar of fire that is that is
[1:30:12] split up that same logos that is upon us
[1:30:17] to do what purpose? To live and fulfill
[1:30:20] his word.
[1:30:22] Now, all right. So, let's let's just
[1:30:24] read a few things here and then we'll
[1:30:26] we'll get we'll start winding it down.
[1:30:28] Now, let's look Hebrews 1 and one.
[1:30:32] God, somebody say God.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Who at sunundry times and diverse
[1:30:38] manners spake in time past unto the
[1:30:42] fathers by the prophets. So the logos,
[1:30:48] the the great God, he spoke in times
[1:30:53] past to the fathers, to the people by
[1:30:57] the prophets. God was the author.
[1:31:02] The prophets were simply Amen. the the
[1:31:06] used the pen. The prophets could see
[1:31:10] ahead. The prophets could look back and
[1:31:13] tell us. Moses could tell us what
[1:31:15] happened in the garden and Moses had
[1:31:17] never been there. But as God was showing
[1:31:20] him this, Moses was writing it. So who
[1:31:24] wrote it? Moses or God?
[1:31:27] God's the author. He was simply Amen. He
[1:31:32] was simply the man that pinned it down.
[1:31:35] Amen. Am I making it clear enough?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. God who at times in
[1:31:40] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[1:31:43] the fathers by the prophets hath in
[1:31:45] these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:31:48] son. Now I think this is this is
[1:31:51] wonderful because brother Brandham would
[1:31:53] would would let us know amen that okay
[1:31:56] he prophesied there's a lot of
[1:31:57] prophecies all through those Old
[1:31:59] Testament but when Jesus come he was the
[1:32:02] vindication. So when Jesus came, he was
[1:32:05] the fulfillment of all of these
[1:32:07] prophecies.
[1:32:09] Amen. So when we looked at Jesus, we
[1:32:11] could see all of those things that God
[1:32:14] had already been saying is going to
[1:32:17] happen fulfilled in his body. Brother
[1:32:21] Brennan would put it this way. The Bible
[1:32:22] is the complete revelation of Jesus
[1:32:24] Christ. It was wrote by the prophets.
[1:32:27] Hebrews 1:1 God in new sunundry times
[1:32:29] spake to the fathers by the prophets in
[1:32:31] the last days speak to us through his
[1:32:33] son Jesus Christ which was the prophets
[1:32:37] all of them put together Jesus was
[1:32:40] Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah Jesus was
[1:32:44] Isaiah Jesus was Elijah
[1:32:47] all that they were
[1:32:51] is in him
[1:32:53] now now catch that because the Bible is
[1:32:56] living. So God is calling those Old
[1:33:00] Testament men and he's living his life
[1:33:04] through them
[1:33:06] to show what the Messiah
[1:33:09] Jesus Christ was going to look like.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Are y'all catching that or no?
[1:33:18] So,
[1:33:22] so instead of just putting it on a on a
[1:33:25] blackboard and God saying, "Okay, this
[1:33:26] is this, this, this, this, this, this,
[1:33:28] you get that. Give you an A+ if you got
[1:33:30] that." That that's that's not the way
[1:33:31] God done it. God is living. God's a
[1:33:33] spirit. God ain't got hands. God ain't
[1:33:35] got feet.
[1:33:38] So God would choose a man to come and
[1:33:43] move upon and act himself out as to what
[1:33:49] he was going to do.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; What's no in the flood?
[1:33:59] God was proving that judgment was going
[1:34:02] to come on the earth and that there had
[1:34:04] to be a safety. There had to be an ark.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; There was going to be a prophet saying,
[1:34:10] "This is the ark. Get in." Here we are
[1:34:13] in the last day before judgment and God
[1:34:16] has sent us a prophet and said, "Get in
[1:34:18] to Jesus Christ."
[1:34:20] It was all there. God showed it by
[1:34:24] example for us to see what it is today.
[1:34:28] The lamb of the Old Testament, the
[1:34:31] priests of the Old Testament was simply
[1:34:34] to show us that Jesus would be the one
[1:34:37] who gives his life for me and you. And
[1:34:40] when you can identify it, the Apostle
[1:34:42] Paul says, "This is him."
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; You see that? Okay. All right. Now, so,
[1:34:50] so let's just look here real quick. I'm
[1:34:52] going to I'm going to give you some I'm
[1:34:53] I'm going to show you some words here,
[1:34:55] some scriptures just real quick.
[1:34:57] Philippians 2:16
[1:34:59] it says holding forth the word of life
[1:35:04] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:35:05] that I did not run in vain neither
[1:35:07] labored in vain. In other words, I am
[1:35:09] declaring the word of life and I want
[1:35:13] you to grasp it and hold firmly to it.
[1:35:16] You're listen I'm I'm I'm declaring
[1:35:18] you're hearing. I want you to take hold
[1:35:20] of it. All right. Now, let's look here
[1:35:23] at First John. He's going to give us
[1:35:25] another vision of it. 1 John 1 and1 that
[1:35:28] which is from the beginning which we
[1:35:29] have heard which we have seen with our
[1:35:33] eyes which we have looked upon our hands
[1:35:38] have handled of the word of life for the
[1:35:42] life was manifested
[1:35:45] and we seen it and bear witness and show
[1:35:49] unto you that eternal life. Now, so one
[1:35:54] here's you got the declared word and
[1:35:57] then you've got the living word. Paul is
[1:35:59] saying, "I'm declaring the word and I
[1:36:03] want you to really take this word to
[1:36:04] heart." And then John says, "I seen the
[1:36:08] word. I seen it living in a literal
[1:36:13] body.
[1:36:15] My hands touched him.
[1:36:19] My eyes beheld him. I seen the word in a
[1:36:25] body.
[1:36:27] Now you say, "Now this is crazy, brother
[1:36:28] Wendle." No, let's just go back. Let's
[1:36:30] let's read a few more scriptures. Let's
[1:36:31] let's look here real quick. All right,
[1:36:33] let let's let's look here. Uh uh uh
[1:36:37] there in uh of course we don't have to
[1:36:40] turn to Romans 19 or Revelations 19 when
[1:36:43] Jesus comes and the Bible says he he's
[1:36:46] going to be called his name will be
[1:36:48] called the word of God. Jesus is going
[1:36:51] to be called the word of God. Let's look
[1:36:53] here at Hebrews 4:12. The word of God is
[1:36:56] quick. And that word quick is is not
[1:36:58] really
[1:37:00] it. It it literally means living and
[1:37:02] active. So the word of God is living and
[1:37:07] active and powerful and sharper than any
[1:37:10] two-edged sword, piercing even the
[1:37:12] dividing a sunder of the soul and spirit
[1:37:15] and of the joints and minds and is a
[1:37:18] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:37:20] the heart. Now watch this. Neither now
[1:37:24] now if you're looking at this you're
[1:37:25] thinking word Bible word. Watch. Neither
[1:37:29] is there any creature that is not
[1:37:31] manifest in his his person his sight.
[1:37:38] But all things are naked and open unto
[1:37:42] the eyes of him who we have to do. The
[1:37:46] word of God is not a book.
[1:37:51] The word of God is the living Christ
[1:37:57] that was exempl that was exemplified in
[1:38:00] the body of Christ. And as you read the
[1:38:02] Bible, you're going to understand and
[1:38:04] you listen to the message, that's what
[1:38:05] the prophet was trying to tell us. Now,
[1:38:08] that word is living in your body.
[1:38:13] Now, when I'm looking, I don't have to
[1:38:15] go say, "Well, I I wish I I wish I was
[1:38:17] John. I I like what Devin said. you
[1:38:20] know, the the the prophet age, if the
[1:38:21] prophet, oh, it'd be nice to go up there
[1:38:23] to the prophet where where where where I
[1:38:26] could get the Holy Ghost. But now I can
[1:38:28] truly say, "Amen, I am handling the word
[1:38:32] of life."
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; You're the word of life.
[1:38:38] You've got the same. If the same spirit
[1:38:40] that was in Christ lives in you, it
[1:38:43] quickens your mortal body. So now you're
[1:38:47] the word. So now that you're looking
[1:38:50] when you understand that when you read
[1:38:51] the Bible, you're reading about
[1:38:53] yourself.
[1:38:55] You're reading about redemption. You're
[1:38:57] reading about what God Are y'all
[1:38:59] understanding? So So this is so
[1:39:01] beautiful. Amen. Now, now and and and
[1:39:04] then just a few more. Look, look here at
[1:39:06] First Peter 1:23. being born again, not
[1:39:10] of corruptible seed, but of
[1:39:13] incorruptible,
[1:39:14] by the word of God
[1:39:19] that is on pages,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; by the word of God that is preached
[1:39:26] behind the pullpit,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; by the word of God, which lives
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; and abideth. forever.
[1:39:40] Now we know why this prophet
[1:39:45] 1600 years ago was saying the same thing
[1:39:50] that this prophet
[1:39:52] because it's the living word different
[1:39:55] vessels.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not William Brham. I don't have the
[1:40:00] gift of William Brandom. I'm not a
[1:40:02] prophet.
[1:40:04] But I can believe it the way he said it
[1:40:06] because the same spirit that was in him
[1:40:09] is in me.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; And the same spirit that is in me was in
[1:40:15] Jesus Christ.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Can Can you say amen?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; So So we So the Bible is important. So,
[1:40:24] so those that say, "Ah, it don't matter
[1:40:26] what, you know, I understand God, you
[1:40:28] know, I just," and you don't want to
[1:40:30] line your life up and clean your life up
[1:40:31] according to the word of God, and you
[1:40:32] just want to keep on going the way. Oh,
[1:40:35] you're under a curse,
[1:40:38] and you can't win.
[1:40:40] The word has made me wiser than my
[1:40:45] enemies.
[1:40:47] Satan wants to destroy me. The word,
[1:40:52] the living word, the word that knows
[1:40:55] front, back, in, out is in me.
[1:41:00] Now that word is, that's the inside
[1:41:02] teacher. Now, when I read the pages, the
[1:41:06] inside teacher is showing me right here.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; And it all lines up with that vindicated
[1:41:13] prophet.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:41:18] Well, I just figured that y'all would be
[1:41:20] a little bit more excited about this
[1:41:21] teaching tonight. Amen. Now,
[1:41:25] I want us to to to think just real
[1:41:27] quickly
[1:41:29] and and I I I want to show just a few
[1:41:31] things here just uh in in the life of um
[1:41:35] um Okay, so here's David. How how many
[1:41:39] how many how many knows who David is?
[1:41:41] David was a man after God's own heart.
[1:41:44] David was one. Now the living word as I
[1:41:47] say would overtake the prophets and he
[1:41:49] would act himself through them.
[1:41:52] Moses threw himself between God and the
[1:41:54] people. He throws himself and he says
[1:41:56] you'll have to destroy me before you
[1:41:57] destroy them. You you you you cannot you
[1:42:00] cannot uh uh what you know uh uh I can't
[1:42:03] remember the exact words but he but he's
[1:42:04] saying you know uh your testimony
[1:42:06] throughout the earth if you were to
[1:42:08] destroy them. Brother Brandham says, he
[1:42:11] said, Moses didn't realize it, but it
[1:42:13] was the spirit of Christ that was upon
[1:42:15] him, that was standing. He says he was
[1:42:17] simply talking about Jesus that was
[1:42:19] going to come hundreds of years later.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; He says when when when these guys would
[1:42:24] would would stand, he said, and it was
[1:42:26] move upon him. Now, Brother Brandham
[1:42:28] would teach us and and that that David,
[1:42:31] he he would say he said, "David must
[1:42:34] have been so weird to so many people."
[1:42:37] and and uh uh he said, you know, like
[1:42:39] like Psalms 22:1. Now, y'all get this. I
[1:42:42] want y'all to catch this. Now, David in
[1:42:45] Psalms 22:1, he says, "My God, my God,
[1:42:51] why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou
[1:42:54] so far from helping me than from the
[1:42:57] words of my roaring?"
[1:43:01] Now, Brother Brandham said those around
[1:43:04] David was looking at him thinking,
[1:43:10] um, we're sitting here in the palace.
[1:43:14] Um,
[1:43:15] you've got friends all over. Whoa. what
[1:43:19] um
[1:43:23] the logos would come upon him and he was
[1:43:25] repeating Sister Clea if if you'd put
[1:43:27] that at Mark 15 and 34. Amen. 15 and 34
[1:43:32] the the end the the the end of that be
[1:43:35] amen. And here Jesus Jesus is being
[1:43:38] crucified there at the end he says he
[1:43:40] says my God my God why hast thou
[1:43:43] forsaken me? This was a prophecy of that
[1:43:46] which was to come.
[1:43:48] Look, look, look here, look here at
[1:43:50] Psalms 22:6.
[1:43:52] But I am a worm and no man, a reproach
[1:43:55] of men, and despised of the people. How
[1:43:58] they that see me laugh me to scorn, and
[1:44:01] they shoot out the lip, and they shake
[1:44:03] their head, saying, He trusted on the
[1:44:05] Lord, that he would deliver him. Let him
[1:44:08] deliver him, seeing he delightth in him.
[1:44:14] The logos
[1:44:16] was coming upon an Old Testament prophet
[1:44:20] and was speaking through him of
[1:44:23] something that was going to happen in
[1:44:25] the future. Are are y'all understanding
[1:44:27] this? So what I'm trying to tell you the
[1:44:29] Bible is not just are man this is this
[1:44:31] this is totally cool. We we understand
[1:44:33] Luke 23 and35. Amen. The exact thing
[1:44:36] happened. Psalms 22:13. They gaped upon
[1:44:39] me with their mouths and their ravening
[1:44:41] and a line, a roaring line, and I am
[1:44:43] poured out like water. All my bones are
[1:44:46] out of joint. My heart is like wax. It
[1:44:49] is melted in the midst of my bowels. My
[1:44:51] strength has dried up like a poture, and
[1:44:53] my tongue cleaveth to my jaw, and thou
[1:44:55] hast brought me unto the dust of death.
[1:44:58] For dogs have compassed me. The assembly
[1:45:00] of the wicked have enclosed. They've
[1:45:01] pierced my hands and my feet. May tell
[1:45:05] all my bones. They look and stare at me.
[1:45:08] They part my garments among them, and
[1:45:10] they cast lots upon my vast. But uh but
[1:45:14] be not thou far from me, oh Lord, my
[1:45:18] strength. Haste to help me.
[1:45:22] What was David doing?
[1:45:26] It was God not writing it here. It was
[1:45:30] God living it through his.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Now, why is that important?
[1:45:36] Because the finish of redemption, God is
[1:45:39] still writing his Bible.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; God is still
[1:45:48] moving himself through you, overcoming
[1:45:51] through you, defeating the devil through
[1:45:53] you. Isn't that just beautiful?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Psalms 34 and 20, he keepeth
[1:46:00] all his bones, and not one of them is
[1:46:02] broken.
[1:46:04] Not one of them is broken.
[1:46:08] Now here he is now and David just
[1:46:12] the top part, the bottom part. I mean,
[1:46:14] he's just writing a nice little song and
[1:46:16] then all of a sudden he keepeth all his
[1:46:19] bones and not one of them has broken.
[1:46:23] Those guys would look at him and think,
[1:46:26] David,
[1:46:31] do you see?
[1:46:33] But it was so important that scripture
[1:46:36] there was so important because it was
[1:46:38] that it the Passover lamb could not have
[1:46:41] his bones broke. And God wanted this be
[1:46:44] in the holy rit because there could not
[1:46:48] be a broken bone in Jesus because he was
[1:46:50] going to type the Passover lamb. And the
[1:46:53] p it had already been said, you cannot
[1:46:55] break a bone of that lamb.
[1:47:00] Hallelujah.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And then and so here they
[1:47:04] come. The the the Bible says that the
[1:47:07] the Bible says, "Amen." You know, of
[1:47:09] course, Jesus was Jesus was crucified
[1:47:11] during Passover. Paul wrote, "He is our
[1:47:14] Passover lamb." John the Baptist says,
[1:47:16] "Behold the lamb of God." The Passover
[1:47:18] lamb could not have a bone broken. There
[1:47:20] in Exodus 12:46, in in one house shall
[1:47:23] it be eaten. Thou shalt not carry forth
[1:47:26] ought of the flesh abroad out of the
[1:47:28] house, neither shall you break the bone
[1:47:30] thereof. Look, look there in John 19
[1:47:32] and31. The Jews therefore because it was
[1:47:35] the preparation and the bodies could not
[1:47:37] remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day
[1:47:39] for the Sabbath day was on the high day
[1:47:42] besought Pilate that their legs might be
[1:47:44] broken that they might be taken away.
[1:47:47] Then the soldiers
[1:47:49] then came the soldiers and break the
[1:47:51] legs of the first and of the other which
[1:47:53] way they crucified him. But when they
[1:47:55] came to Jesus and saw that he was dead
[1:47:59] already, they break not his legs.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; This book is
[1:48:09] This book is This book is crazy
[1:48:14] incredible.
[1:48:16] This book
[1:48:19] How could he How could David know that?
[1:48:21] How could David know that all those many
[1:48:24] many many hundreds and hundreds and
[1:48:25] hundreds years ago? What was going?
[1:48:28] Well, it was easy.
[1:48:31] The word, the living word fell upon him
[1:48:36] and the same one came upon Jeremiah and
[1:48:39] the same one came on Isaiah. The same
[1:48:42] God came on every one of them and they
[1:48:44] wrote the book and it all says the same
[1:48:46] thing.
[1:48:51] So when we read this
[1:48:54] guys, I know there's a lot of you that
[1:48:55] like to read fairy tales and like to
[1:48:57] read novels. And listen, if you read
[1:49:00] that stuff more than you read the Bible,
[1:49:03] I I'm just not much in I I don't I don't
[1:49:06] I don't like you girls reading love
[1:49:08] stories. I think it puts a lot of mush
[1:49:10] in your head. I think it puts stuff up
[1:49:13] there that that's not in reality to the
[1:49:16] world to to to to to
[1:49:19] what's here and it puts a lot of junk in
[1:49:20] your head. Uh you you have high
[1:49:23] expectations about your Romeo.
[1:49:27] But this right here puts expectations
[1:49:30] that are real.
[1:49:33] this thing right here. If you can catch
[1:49:35] a hold of what God's trying to tell you
[1:49:37] in this thing right here
[1:49:42] and you understand
[1:49:45] that you are the bride of the God of
[1:49:49] heaven.
[1:49:51] Come on now.
[1:49:54] If you boys could understand
[1:49:57] how incredible
[1:49:59] you are in the sight of God,
[1:50:02] Brother Brandham said, "Then this would
[1:50:03] become the greatest love story because
[1:50:06] this truly is a love letter." This truly
[1:50:10] is God making it to you. It was the son
[1:50:14] of God in a body. Well, can you say
[1:50:18] amen?
[1:50:20] Look at the predictions of M and and
[1:50:22] this is this is an easy one. We we we
[1:50:24] like this. We we we do this every
[1:50:26] Christmas. They're in in musicians can
[1:50:28] come. They're in Micah 5 and one. Amen.
[1:50:32] It says, "Now gather thyself in troops,
[1:50:35] oh daughters of troops. He Rome hath
[1:50:40] laid siege against us.
[1:50:43] They shall smite the judge of Israel
[1:50:46] Christ with a rod upon the cheek. But
[1:50:49] thou Bethlehem Euphr, though thou be
[1:50:53] young or or little among the thousands
[1:50:56] of Judah,
[1:50:58] yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
[1:51:02] me, that is to be the ruler in Israel,
[1:51:06] whose goings forth have been from old
[1:51:09] and from everlasting.
[1:51:13] God was declaring,
[1:51:15] I'm going to create a body
[1:51:19] And who is this body? Who is this going
[1:51:20] to be? This it's sad in the message. We
[1:51:23] got we got people that still trying to
[1:51:25] separate Jesus from God. Still trying
[1:51:27] when you understand that God God created
[1:51:30] that body. And yes, the flesh had to
[1:51:33] pray. And yeah, but Jesus was God. Jesus
[1:51:38] was
[1:51:40] Jesus will never be separated from God
[1:51:43] again. God. God and Christ are one. And
[1:51:49] right here declares it,
[1:51:51] man. This one that's going to be born is
[1:51:54] going to be from everlasting. Who is
[1:51:56] from everlasting? There ain't an eternal
[1:51:58] son.
[1:52:01] It's the great eternal God living in
[1:52:03] that body.
[1:52:05] Can you say amen?
[1:52:08] Isaiah 7 and 14. Therefore, the Lord
[1:52:10] himself shall give you a sign, and
[1:52:13] behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:52:16] a son, and thou shalt call his name
[1:52:19] Emmanuel.
[1:52:22] What is Emanuel? God with us.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; What it's showing here is the living
[1:52:29] word is going to take on a body.
[1:52:33] It's going to take on a body. It's going
[1:52:36] to be God. Look, look there at look
[1:52:39] there at Isaiah 9 and6. For unto us a
[1:52:42] child is born, unto us a son is given.
[1:52:45] And the government shall be upon his
[1:52:46] shoulders, and his name shall be called
[1:52:48] Wonderful Counselor,
[1:52:51] the mighty God, the everlasting father,
[1:52:55] the prince of peace. This great eternal
[1:52:58] God was going to be living in a body.
[1:53:03] Doesn't that isn't that just beautiful?
[1:53:07] That's redemption.
[1:53:10] That's redemption.
[1:53:12] Well, I sure wish some of you was more
[1:53:15] enthused about the word of the Lord
[1:53:19] because
[1:53:21] this this this
[1:53:23] could really be a game changer for you
[1:53:25] someday
[1:53:27] because
[1:53:30] what I've shared with you tonight will
[1:53:31] really it'll really help you to defeat
[1:53:34] the enemy.
[1:53:36] But
[1:53:38] if all you're interested in is,
[1:53:41] "Well, I'm tired and yeah, I've heard
[1:53:43] that message." You're missing the whole
[1:53:45] point. You're missing the whole point.
[1:53:48] The living word is here. And if you're
[1:53:50] not willing to get out of that tiredness
[1:53:51] and say, "Lord, yes, yes, do it." Then
[1:53:55] you're going to go back home. You've
[1:53:56] heard some words. So, you're going to
[1:53:57] throw your Bible back on the on the on

[1:54:21] something on the inside of you if he
[1:54:22] lives in you. the that that living God
[1:54:26] inside is he's been doing every he sent
[1:54:29] a prophet to make sure that you get it
[1:54:32] right.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; And that that that Holy Spirit should be
[1:54:36] saying yes. Yes. I've got some men that
[1:54:40] are preaching it exactly the way the
[1:54:42] prophet brought it. Oh, take it. Take
[1:54:45] it. Take it.
[1:54:47] But if we're lukewarm with it,
[1:54:51] right?

[2:05:34] What a wonderful
[2:05:37] [Music]
[2:05:42] Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:45] We thank you for your
[2:05:47] choosing us.
[2:05:52] There are certain scriptures you put on
[2:05:54] the printed page
[2:06:01] that was meant for me, that was meant
[2:06:03] for this people, this generation.
[2:06:09] And your prophet would say, "Well, you
[2:06:11] might not see Orman Neville or you might
[2:06:14] not see this name."
[2:06:17] [Music]
[2:06:19] But the mystery of it, there's something
[2:06:20] about that word that is saying, "This is
[2:06:22] you.
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:27] You're the human canvas. You're the one
[2:06:29] that I'm going to use to fulfill this
[2:06:31] word."
[2:06:34] That we say thank you.
[2:06:37] Oh, let us walk with you and talk with
[2:06:40] you.
[2:06:42] I ask that this revelation of this word
[2:06:44] would be so precious to this people.
[2:06:49] Let this message be so dear and so rich.
[2:06:57] I thank you for it, Father.
[2:07:00] We thank you.
[2:07:03] Thank you for such wonderful young
[2:07:05] people.

[2:07:11] who's got one goal, and that's to raise
[2:07:13] warriors
[2:07:15] of the cross,
[2:07:18] willing to teach them how to surrender
[2:07:21] and give themselves,
[2:07:24] surrender themselves to that great
[2:07:27] logos.
[2:07:31] Thank you for the ministers that still
[2:07:33] preach this gospel. Thank you, Lord, for
[2:07:35] the prophet that you sent us. Thank
[2:07:37] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for giving us
[2:07:39] eyes to see and ears to hear.
[2:07:43] Now, Lord, we want to respond
[2:07:47] by just giving ourselves to you and say,
[2:07:49] "Use us.
[2:07:51] Let my let my body reflect your word.
[2:07:55] [Music]
[2:07:58] Let me never bring you shame, but let me
[2:08:00] bring you glory."
[2:08:03] Now, Father, we give ourselves to you
[2:08:06] and we ask that you would forgive us of
[2:08:07] our sin.
[2:08:10] Make us pure.
[2:08:13] If you show us in your Bible, Lord,
[2:08:16] we want to be very quick to obey it.
[2:08:21] Help us, Jesus.
[2:08:23] Thank you for your Holy Spirit, that
[2:08:25] great breath of God.

[2:08:31] for being with sister
[2:08:34] uh sister Denise today.

[2:08:40] that surgery.

[2:08:46] now. Lord, we just ask that you would
[2:08:48] help her as she was in a lot of pain
[2:08:50] earlier, Lord, when we were when she
[2:08:52] came out of the surgery. and just ask,
[2:08:55] Father, that you'd be with her and give
[2:08:56] her peace and let her rest really well
[2:08:59] tonight. Give her a speedy recovery.
