Like to go to prayer if we may and ask brother Michael if he'd mind coming and leading us in prayer. We do have a few written needs. Um one from brother Mike. It is good to see brother Mike and sister niece here with us here tonight. Amen. I've been missing them. The one from brother Mike says, "Please pray for my wife. She has had an infection from surgery. So let's remember sister Denise in our prayer and also from sister Carol Alice Chapman uh hospital is sending her to hope on hospice and then for her granddaughter Sierra this morning her fiance died of overdose so let's remember them in our prayers and then she has Mariah and uh Carlina is that correct? Okay. So, let's remember them in our prayers and also um brother Seth Martin's wife just came to our attention that she's been in the hospital the last few days um that she's been having the same episodes that Zion has been having. So, Zion I believe was healed of that um during the prayer line um Saturday there at the Ohio camp, but then she started having it what the next day, Sunday. So, let's remember um Sister Rebecca Martin. That youth camp has made a lot of made a lot of demons and mad. So, it's been a lot of sicknesses coming out of that camp. So, let's just pray for that whole camp. Amen. That the that the Lord will come down and and touch everyone that was a part of that. And also, Sister Kathy, I don't know her last name, but the ones that were here this morning, um, she wanted me to put down a request here for her that she's having an EKG and an electric cardiogram tomorrow. So, let's remember Sister Kathy in our prayer. And also, Dad was mentioning the Lancaster family is doing better, but brother Harry is still struggling pretty hard. So, let's remember them in our prayers. mom is still um not doing well. So, let's just remember all the needs in this church. Amen. And if you have a need up on your heart, just make it known by the lifting of your hand. God bless you now. Amen. You love him here this evening. Just thinking about a lot of these requests that are being uh put out. You know, there's a lot of sick sick people. Uh we're going to pray for them and as brother Kobe was talking about that uh at Ohio camp. You know, some of the sisters have come up with same some of the same s symptoms that the other one has had. It just seems like there's really uh a push against what's been going on here, not only just in our church, but around the around the message in general. We see a lot of stirring that's going on around the around the uh message. A lot of people just kind of making their way back in and coming. But we know that when something like h that happens, a move of God happens that it produces twins. You know that every revival produces twins and where there's the good, there's the bad that's going to come along. So, it's important to keep those that are struggling and those that are going through some of these things just in prayer. And uh we're just uh glad for what the Lord is doing uh in our services and glad what he's doing all around. So, let's just bow our head and just keep our brother and sister in our in our hearts. Heavenly Father, we just love you, Lord. Father, we're appreciative, Lord. We just want to tell you how thankful we are, Lord, to just be in your house, Lord, to be of good, sound mind, Lord, health in our bodies, Father. And Lord, all the different all the different blessings that you've given us, Lord. And and Father, I would just ask that you would just see some of these requests. We know that the devil, he's going out, Lord, he's trying to devour, Lord, the seed of God out of our hearts. And Lord, the things that the words that have been planted through the ministry. Father, I would just ask God that you would just be with our sister Rebecca, Seth's wife. Father, Lord, you see the thing that she's going through in her body, Lord. And I would just ask that you would be there with Brother Seth. I would pray that you would give him, Lord, the words to speak to his wife, the patience, Father, and the eyes, Lord, to to see and understand everything that's been going on. And we would just ask that your sweet spirit would go down and it would just give peace to Sister Becca, Father. Lord, I would just pray that you would strengthen their little family, Father. and God that you would see us here in Pony and the different ones that are sick. The request from Sister Carol about our young lady's fiance just uh dying of an overdose. I would just pray, Father, that you would be in the situation. God, I would ask that your light would just shine over her, just lead her to the cross, that they would come and they would find that peace in your life, Lord, in your word. And I would ask, God, that you would see the ones that are missing in this building. You see, brother Duran, Lord, you see Sister Press. Lord, we're thankful to have Sister Denise with us.

We've got Brother David Roman uh with us here this evening. And uh um you know, brother David was was uh was saved when I was just a little kid uh there at our church that I was raised in there in Claremore. And um and so we've we've been friends over the years and and u but this is going to be the first time that I think this is the first time you've ever preached for us. And uh so we're just we're just delighted to have brother David Roman and u uh we sure love he and his wife. And so we just want him to take liberty here tonight. And um I I talked with brother or texted brother Harry. Sounded like everyone was is about over that mess that they've uh they've been dealing with. But brother Harry himself is is uh really not not feeling good. And so we just want to continue to pray for them. But how many's come to hear the word of the Lord tonight? How many's going to pull on the word of the Lord tonight? That's all right for the preacher to preach, but remember the gift doesn't work without us. And uh so we we want to pull on that gift. Amen. Why Why don't we just sing that song? Uh here's my cup, Lord. Fill it up. Here's my cup, Lord. Lord, I lift it up. We do need you, Lord. We need you tonight. Come and quench this thirsting out my soul. [Music] Feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. It's truly a blessing to be here this evening. We love the Lord and I'm thankful for you. May be seated. Should I say you may be seated? &gt;&gt; All right. Y'all may be seated. Praise the Lord. I appreciate the Lord's goodness and mercy. And I'm very, very thankful for getting saved in 1976, April the 8th, along here at Hippie. And God changed my life at Victory Tabernacle in Claremore, Oklahoma. and &gt;&gt; been going ever since and come to know the message later on and and God has been so good to me. I appreciate all the sister Martin here and brother Durn and brother Burus and all the different ones that led me to the Lord and still going strong after all these years through the through different battles and different storms and God God is good. And then the greatest thing is the when we got into the message and understood that God sent a prophet to this generation and he gave us thus said the Lord. So we know where we stand today. So I want to take a little thought in a first scripture in uh let's see I'm not trying to think it. Galatians 4:19 and it says my little children in whom I travail in pain until Christ be formed in you. &gt;&gt; All right. my little children in whom I travail in pain till Christ be formed in you. And let's go to the Lord in prayer if you would. I'm not used to the orders. Y'all bear with me. So, our gracious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Truly, Lord, we're thankful to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I'm thankful for the many friends and all the miracles we've seen over the years and thankful for the message that you've sent to us, Lord, in this day that gives us the strength, the grace, and the mercy to enter endure all things that come our way, Lord. And father I want to teach tonight Lord on reigning in life through the Lord Jesus Christ. We give the glory, the pray praise and honor Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. So you see I guess we got to &gt;&gt; just obey the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. Just get after Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get used to this technology here. I'm getting over can't see. All right. So, the subject is tonight is reigning in life through the Lord Jesus Christ. And there's a message the Lord gave me several years ago and I've kind of preached it here and there sometimes, but uh and the first part of it in the scripture reading is Romans 15:12- 21. By one man's sin, by one man's righteousness. If you think about, you know, I'm just going to kind of pre preamble. There was one man that sinned in the garden in the beginning, and that was Adam. &gt;&gt; And where were you when Adam fell? Where was I when Adam fell? &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; we had nothing to do with it. But through one man's fall, we were born in sin. We were shaped in iniquity. We come into the world speaking lies. &gt;&gt; And how many of you have made mistakes? Or how many of us, we've all made mistakes in life? We've all done things we wish we wouldn't had done. And I could go through my whole life and think, "Lord, I wish I hadn't done this. I wish I hadn't done that." And all these different things. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "By one man's disobedience, we're made sinners." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By one man's obedience, we're made righteous. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe in holiness from head to toe, backward and forward and stuff. I was a long-haired hippie back in the day. I remember being in the church one time, one service after I got saved. I looked around the church and I thought I look like I look like one of the sisters. &gt;&gt; I had the long hair and of course I I was a hippie. I I looked like a sister. Nobody had to tell me nothing but I looked around and I didn't look like the brothers. So I was real skinny. I went got me a haircut and got cleaned up and brother Burr said, "You look like a matchstick." But anyway, God can change us. God's the one who changes us. We don't change ourselves. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I could go through the whole testimony how, you know, began as a Methodist and Catholic and I've been to every kind of church, Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, 7th Day Adventist Church of Christ. I have literally visited them all. Mormons, you name it, I've been there. &gt;&gt; And yet when end of the day, God sent a prophet to this generation. &gt;&gt; All right? And the scripture that got me was initially was uh some brothers had witnessed to me at the store we used to own back when I was about 20 something years old and I moved them on to 16. I work my way up and own the store and different things. But &gt;&gt; uh the brothers used to come in there and pray. They were from brother brother Bur's church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And one day brother John David Rhodess he gave me the scripture said it's not him that willth &gt;&gt; it's not him that runth &gt;&gt; but God that shows mercy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I and I kept hearing that and I kept hearing that and I thought that kept going through my mind. I thought, "Wow, not him that willth him that grindeth, but God that shows mercy." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so the Lord kept dealing with me. I thought, "Oh my goodness, I don't know." So I told and then the brothers kept after me, you know, they come to the store and they said, "You going to come to church?" And I said, "Well, one of these days." And so one night they got me cornered and they said, "I'll tell you what, I'll be there Thursday night." So I told my wife, I said I said uh I told uh the boys there I'd be at their church Thursday night. She goes, "You told you told them?" I said, "Are you going with me?" She said, "Who told them?" I said, "I did." So goodbye. And I went and when I went, there was the Holy Ghost moving in the church. It was just like the old time &gt;&gt; power of God working. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it was moving in the church. And I said, "My goodness, there's something different here." &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I did. I just went to visit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I had my mind made up. I'm just going to visit. That's all I'm here for. So I went and I sat there. All of a sudden, somebody prophesied in tongue. Sister Elder Burst. Prophesied in tongue. And then the interpretation was, "Yay, my son. I have called you this night. Come give me your heart." And I thought, "Who is that for?" I look around trying to pick. I didn't even know what it Pentecost was. &gt;&gt; So who's that for? &gt;&gt; Yeah. and come again said, "Yay, my son. I've called you this night. Give me your heart." And I thought, "Wonder who's this for?" I kept feeling a tug. And finally, I said, "Well, Lord, if that's for me," and then the only way I knew to say it, let somebody lay a hand on me. [Laughter] I ran to the altar and baldled like a baby, gave my heart to the Lord, just crying and come up shouting and praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's a a new birth. Brother Ron said, "A new birth is messy." &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, we get kind of starchy over time, &gt;&gt; but the oldfashioned Holy Ghost is still real. &gt;&gt; And God sent a message with the truth and the word. We got all that, but we still need the oldfashioned power of God to change our life and to help to mold us and make us into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "As you have born the image of the earthly, &gt;&gt; so shall you also bear the image of the heavenly." &gt;&gt; And I was preaching when I used to travel on business all for years. God worked me up from a bus boy to the corporate level in business for several years and I used to fly all over the country and I and I'd preach in different churches, little churches here and there and I was preaching it was a message church in I forget what Indiana or some place but it was a brother sitting on the front row and I said brother I said where'd you get that face and he was just you know like what I said as you bore the image of the earthly you'll bear the image of the heavenly &gt;&gt; so you bear that face come on you just because that's how you going to look. You didn't plan how you're going to look. You you look like you're going to look because God said this is your way you're going to look. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So, same way it is when you're born into the spirit of God, God knows who you are. He knows what you're called for. He knows what your purpose is for. And I know so I know the people that brother Wendle used to go preaching here, preaching here, preaching there. He's still preaching, going strong. I know that God has called that young man to be what he is. Now, I'm not no preacher like any of those pre I'm not a preacher like all these. I did the jail ministry for 10 years and different things. I was in outreach and doortodoor and &gt;&gt; I know me and brother Michael Moore was out. I'm going different than I planned, but that's what &gt;&gt; Yeah. But but brother Michael Moore, we he and I used to go witnessing and uh we walk we was walking past a veterinarian shop one day in Clmore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh this little lady in the had was in a in a car and she was balling because she had a little old dog of hers and that little dog had died on her and she was crying. So we stopped by there and said, "Ma'am, can we help?" Because me and Brother Michael used to go witnessing door to door everywhere. We went to everybody's house &gt;&gt; and uh I had people going to hit me over the head a few times. But but anyway, I said, "Ma'am, are you okay?" She goes, "No." She said, "I'm not. My my dogs just died and the vet ain't here. Nobody's here. And I said, "Well," I said, "Would you like us to pray?" And she said, "Would you do that?" She We did. We prayed. That little dog come alive. It it breathed a few times and come alive. &gt;&gt; We didn't say nothing to nobody. We didn't go around bragging say, "Look what God doing." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We didn't do all that. &gt;&gt; But we were in church later. It was uh well, I can't remember the brothers now. Him and his wife started coming later. But anyway, they come to church a few years later or maybe a little while later. I don't remember how long. And they uh the lady says, "Can I testify?" She turned out to be a United Pentecostal lady who had backslid. &gt;&gt; She said, "Can I testify?" And and the brother Bur said, "Yeah." So she stood up. She goes, "That brother on the drums up there and that brother right there come by and told her about what happened there." And you know, she anyway she she kind of was telling about it. You know, &gt;&gt; you know, God still does miracles. Sure. &gt;&gt; You know, God still, you know, we need the word, we need the truth, and we need the the power of God. &gt;&gt; We need, you know, you know that song says, "Time after time, I hear people say to me, &gt;&gt; why don't we see miracles like we used to see?" &gt;&gt; I still believe in miracles. God hears us when we pray. Because God was God back yesterday and he's still God today. &gt;&gt; He will do it again and again and again. Is the same God today as he always has been. Yesterday, now forever. He's always the same. There's no reason to doubt. God will do it again. And I've seen many, many, many miracles &gt;&gt; that God has done in our life. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I could write a whole book on it, but I like people telling me ought to write a book. I say everybody write books. &gt;&gt; I don't need to write no book. &gt;&gt; And I don't want nobody to know all my good, bad, and ugly. I wish had made mistakes. &gt;&gt; Anybody Anybody in here has never made a mistake? And you know, it's a shame. The church beats each other up over mistakes. &gt;&gt; But by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By one man's obedience, &gt;&gt; bless the Lord, &gt;&gt; many are made righteous. &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is not based on your past, your failures, your mistakes, all whatever you done. You've been called by God. &gt;&gt; You're a child of God. You sing a song. If you're a child of God, go home. &gt;&gt; Talk to the Lord. take it to the Lord. I I even thought about the many things that brother Brandon went through. I mean, you talk about to bring this message to us. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; He was fought tooth and nail every kind of direction. This happened, this happened, different things happen. But when things happen, sometimes he would say, "God is leading me in a different direction." &gt;&gt; There's a reason for it &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in Romans 8:28, "All things work together for good to them that love the Lord and are called according to his purpose." So when God calls you, I I thought about reigning in life, which is what I was kind of my subject. Let me see if I can get back in there. But when when you when God calls you, he wants you to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; When God calls you, he wants you to be victorious. When God calls you, he has made a Have we got that still? &gt;&gt; When seeing to move to the next one, Okay. In Romans 5:12 it says, "Wherefore as by one man sin entered the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. For until the law, sin was in the world. But sin is not imputed when there's no law." Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who was a figure of him that was to come. So everybody's going to be born in sin, shape or neither come out speaking lies. And he said, "Nevertheless, death reigned over all of us." &gt;&gt; The Bible says the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Go next one, What's this? &gt;&gt; I got my little granddaughter left with us. But but not as the offense, so also it's a free gift. &gt;&gt; For through the offense of one, many be dead. Much more by the grace of God and the gift of righteousness which is one man Jesus Christ has abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification. For by one man's death, for by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a smaller print. Therefore, by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one came the free gift to come of all me all men to the justification of life. I tried to make them bigger, but I didn't. For as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one man, who was that who was that one man? Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, you're your your your your ups and downs don't save it. &gt;&gt; Your mistakes don't save you. &gt;&gt; We could beat ourselves up forever over, man. I've done this, done this, did did &gt;&gt; just repent. Get up and go. &gt;&gt; Forget the past. Amen. Paul said, "Forgetting those things which are behind me, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; reaching toward the things that are before me, &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling in Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could we get a hold of that. Brother Bram said, Brother Bram said, "We need rapturing faith." &gt;&gt; And you said, "We hardly got faith for a headache." &gt;&gt; We say, "How are we going to get rapturing faith?" &gt;&gt; Well, it's going to take knowing who we are in Jesus Christ. It's going to take quit letting all the little uh things that come our way that brings her down. And you know, I respect Sister Jerene and brother Duran. He's going through some tough tough times, but that man's a soldier. &gt;&gt; I respect that. &gt;&gt; I respect brother Burrus and sister Burrus. We miss him &gt;&gt; and we don't understand the whole situation, but thank God for what they've done in their ministry and we'll see them on the other side. All these things don't mean anything. We have to overlook all the junk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and look to the author and the finisher of our faith. Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despise the shame and is set on the right hand of power. &gt;&gt; God is still God and God is still in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So &gt;&gt; Amen. And see where am I? Okay, next one please. Reign means to exercise sovereign authority. &gt;&gt; Not our own authority or our own ability, but God's authority. &gt;&gt; See, we're weak. We're human beings, you know. We're just human beings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was sold out to this gospel, &gt;&gt; called by God for that purpose, &gt;&gt; where would we be without if we were in a denominational church? &gt;&gt; Sure. You you can't even preach unless you got a their ticket. &gt;&gt; You got to believe exactly what they tell you to preach. You think I'd have liberty to preach what I'm preaching here in any other church &gt;&gt; or run you out so fast. &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear that &gt;&gt; because their system they license you and if you don't have their mark, you can't buy or sell. &gt;&gt; You have to you you got to have that Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, whatever it is. You can't preach unless you agree to every little thing they tell you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; But we ought to agree with the message. That's for sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there's many interpretations of the message. We understand that, too. But put all that aside. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you know, Brother Bram said how that it wasn't a a miracle how Martin Luther was fought and and could rise up with the just live of faith, &gt;&gt; but it was all the fanatics that followed after. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the same thing with brother Brandon's ministry. all kinds of different I believe it this way, this way, this way, this way, this way. We believe it the Bible way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandon take you back to the Bible. &gt;&gt; So all this other stuff, we shouldn't be divided amongst each other. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And I don't even criticize if somebody believes that this way or whatever they want to believe that's between them and the Lord. &gt;&gt; And each local church is sovereign. So you're not we don't we should never fight with each other. You know, I got friends that are Baptist. I got friends that are Methodists. I got friends that are Lutherans. I got friends that are Church of Christ. I got friends that are any kind of denomination. I respect the person that wants to serve God. &gt;&gt; If they don't see what I see, that's okay. &gt;&gt; If they're called to something, they'll see it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if they're not, they're not. And and who's to say who God is going to say is going to be at the public gates. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; That is not our job. &gt;&gt; Our job is to preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He believeth not shall be damned, and these signs shall follow &gt;&gt; Yeah. them to believe. &gt;&gt; That's our job is to preach the word and whoever accepts it. Jesus said, "All that the father has given me will come &gt;&gt; and I will not lose one. &gt;&gt; I will raise them up again at the last day. God is in control." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet I've I've been fought as hard as anybody. &gt;&gt; I've been lied on. I've been cheated. I've been talked about, mistreated. Well, well, well. You remember Sister Sander? I don't know what you come to do. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you come to do. I come to clap my hands. I come say amen. I'll come to leave for joy. Can you leave for joy? Black sister used to go our church years ago. Man, you talk about fired up. Tears are flowing. We need a fashion sin killing, devil chasing, camp meeting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And I and I I understand too there's extremes in that. There's a lot to put on, &gt;&gt; but there's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, next one, please. is and now the this these two scriptures the Lord dealt with me several years ago on this but this scripture here the ministration of death in 2 Corinthians 3:7 says but if the ministration of death written engraved in stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was done away next one says how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious. For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness, exceeding glory. So if you can be so condemned that you can't even hold your head up, if you can be so condemned that you just, you know, I see a lot of people and I've been to churches everywhere I go traveling. I go I find a church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I see so many depressed people in church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they ain't getting encouraged. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They're just going through the motions. Oh my, I got to go to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they're fuzzy fighting and arguing and harling and sad and and how you doing? Oh, not too good, brother. Well, you just went to church and you're just as sad or maybe sadder than you was when you come come in the door. Ain't something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eternal life. &gt;&gt; And if we we got to get a hold of the substance of it. And the Bible says, "My people perish for lack of knowledge, for lack of understanding." &gt;&gt; God is simplicity. &gt;&gt; So, uh, the glory that excelth in 2 Corinthians 3:10 says, "For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelth, a greater glory. For if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remainth is glorious. Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech. &gt;&gt; This just call it like it is. We're saved by the grace of God. By the mercy of God, he's called us. He said, "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Till the day of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We used to think it would perform it till the next revival. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then we have to go get another tank of gas. &gt;&gt; Well, you do need to get a tank of gas once in a while. We do get down and out. We need a renewing. But that doesn't change your position in Christ. &gt;&gt; It just needs you out of gas. Time to go pray. Time to get a hold of God. Time to say, "Lord, encourage me." You know, I'm so I I've had time to pray and said, "Lord, I'm so discouraged. &gt;&gt; Seem like I'm fought in every direction." Boy, I just And then the Lord comes through and man, I wake up and praise the Lord. I'm up here. I've been It's like I got a new tank of gas. I'm ready to roll. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, did I already read that one? Oh yeah, but and not as Moses which put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the end of that which is abolished. But their minds were blinded for until this day remainth the same veil and taken away and the reading of the Old Testament which fell is done away in Christ. The the Old Testament was the types and shadows of the New Testament and the law. The Bible says, "Wherefore then serveth the law, it was added because of transgression till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in a mediator." And he said, "The mediator is not a mediator one, but God is one." So the law was our school master. It told us what was right and wrong. Thou shall not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shalt not bear false witness. All these different things. The law brought us to the fact to recognize that we were a sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it didn't condemn you. It wanted to make you know I'm a sinner. I need salvation. &gt;&gt; Then when you get born again, born again, there's really been a change in me. Born again just like Jesus said. Born again and all because of Calvary. I'm glad. So glad that I've been born again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I, you know, I drink all I want to. I smoke all I want to. I cuss all I want to. I don't want to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. A new birth. &gt;&gt; A new birth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. See where I'm at here. &gt;&gt; Already moved it one, Or did have I already read that one? Okay. Thank you. But their minds were blinded for until that day this day remained at the same veil and taken away in the reading of the Old Testament which veil is done away in Christ. A lot of people still they still try to live by the letter of the law to be saved. A lot of these old time holiness folks and I believe in the old time holiness but a lot of them trying to do it by the law. I I visited a little old outreach I've been visiting lately up in Bortlesville and the guy's got he believes that you can't show your elbows. He says, "Why you wear them short sleeve shirts?" I said, "Well, I ain't had nobody left that for my elbows." and he got this and he said, "Well, I I I couldn't do that. I got convictions." I said, "Well, where's that in the Bible?" You know, and bless his heart, he's a good person, you know, but then I go through the Bible studies and he have his sleeves. He got these short work shorts these shirts, but they go past his elbow. See, there's so much craziness &gt;&gt; that's been added to the word. And the Bible says, "Don't add to the Bible and don't take away from the Bible because the Bible is to give you life." Jesus said, "I come that you might have life and you might have life more abundantly." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. So, and let's see where I'm at said in 2 Corinthians 3:15, "But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, it shall be taken away. The veil when it is turned to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now, the Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. &gt;&gt; Where's liberty? Y'all y'all got it here. I ain't talking necessarily to all, but I believe we all we all need refreshing. &gt;&gt; I I I mean, I tell you, the Martin family is on fire for God. There ain't no I They do more than I could ever dream of. I don't have I don't have the gifts y'all got. I'm just I'm just doortodoor and street preacher and outreach and jail ministry and you know that's what I've always done. I thought I was going to try to be a pastor and I learned I wasn't called to be that. I don't I don't have the patience. Brother Window and I don't have the ability. So I'm just an outreach and that's all I like to do. I witness to people everywhere. I went to in the store. I 72 still working full-time because we're supporting grandkids and I I witness the people in there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of them like it, some of them don't. But I don't use I use wisdom. I don't just do it. But if I see somebody and talk about them, I explain a few things to them &gt;&gt; and uh just plant some seed. You know, &gt;&gt; one plants, one waters, God gives increase. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. But we all with open face see we should we don't have to be ashamed beholding in the glass the glory of the Lord or change into the same im image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The law does not save us. It only makes us aware that we are sinners in need of salvation. It identified sin so we could know that we need a savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose. Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus under good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them." Our works don't save us. Bible says, "Our righteousness is filthy rags." &gt;&gt; But we do want to live a life that's pleasing unto God. when I was working a in a grocery store in in O was Oklahoma. Of course, I used to I just got saved 1976 and and boy, I was on fire. You know, I just I'd be witnessing to the to the Coke man, the deliver man, and the bread man, and I'd talk to him about God putting his family back together, and I I'd be witnessing to everybody, and in this in the deal, I'd go. But anyway, this one manager, uh, he he hated my guts and he used to pick on me all the time. I was I was doing the dirty and frozen food and he would he would call me. He would just pick on me and call me to go take out grocery, do this, do that. Well, if the milk was empty, I'm going to fill the milk up and then I'll be back up there. &gt;&gt; I just said, "No, I've got to make sure there's milk cuz everybody needs some milk and I'm the milk man. So, I fill the milk up and then I'll be up there." Well, he got mad at me one day and uh he he called me and then here a few days later, the Lord's been dealing with it. So, he I was go walking through the back room. He picked me up by the shirt, put me up against the wall. He goes, "Do you think I'm going to hell? Do you think I'm going to hell?" I say, "Are you saved?" He said, he put put me there. He got saved a few few months later, I found out, you know. And then I had another grocery store I worked at in Claremore and there was a manager there and he was filthy, put it that way. And he used and pardon me I don't want to say much but he used to put like inappropriate pictures in front of the the girls that worked in the office on the deal. I went back in the back at one time and and uh see they were crying back there the people were in the office and I told him I said what's the matter and they told me what was going on. So I went up to him I said look I said them girls don't appreciate you doing that putting that filthiness in their face when they go clock in and out. I'm just I'm just a little old checker. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He goes, "Who told you that?" I said, "I ain't telling you." So, oh, he was mad. I would I never would tell. I never have told him to this day. And I said, "I ain't telling telling you." I didn't want to get them in trouble. So, anyway, one day he walks in the store. He's little bitty short guy. We called him squatty. But he come walking in the door and he look I was the only checker up front. He goes, "You clock out. You're fired. You're out of here." All right, goodbye. So, I wrote to the corporate office and I just let him know kind of the situation that happened there and they fired him later on you. So anyway, the the whole situation went on and then it was about maybe a year or so later I went to work at that super rich in Aaso and he ended up well first of all we owned a little grocery store in Katonville and we bought that that was a miracle that God did that's where I got saved but anyway when that all went south and I went to work in OASO in Super H and uh so anyway when I walked in the door to get a job the manager was standing there and that little guy was there and of course the Lord had already dealt with him. He said he's a good boy. Hire him. I there like three three years. See, and he got saved. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, see, God can work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and God does the miracles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And but he got saved and you for lost parts. I know he's been saved since, but you know, God God does the work. &gt;&gt; One planteth, one watth, God gives the increase. And I go on and on about different things like that. But God is still the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Let's see. In Psalms 103:11 says, "For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgression from us." &gt;&gt; Like a father pityth his children, so God pityth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame, and rememberth we are dust. &gt;&gt; We're human beings, &gt;&gt; you know. Now, this is kind of weird, but the Bible says Jesus, our Lord Jesus, which was God and manifest in human flesh. The Bible says he was tempted in all points &gt;&gt; as we are. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about that on the way down here. I said, "So maybe lust, &gt;&gt; all points." &gt;&gt; Now, that's that sounds kind of crude, but what I'm saying is he knew the battles we fight. &gt;&gt; You know, a man's a man, a woman's a woman, and people's people. But you got to overcome those fears. You know, me and my wife's been married 52 years, going on 53 years now. And uh you know, God's changed her changed her, saved her. You know, fact, we was in Walmart yesterday getting groceries. This lady go always commenting on, "Well, I love that beautiful long hair of my wife and and uh she was I I like to kid with people." So, she was walking past it was yesterday and said, "Oh, that she this lady, she goes, "Oh, your wife's got the most beautiful long hair." I said, "I used to have in the 70s." So, she just laughed. But long hair don't save you, but long hair is God made men and God made women. And the Bible says, "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair is a shame, but a woman's hair is given for a covering?" You don't have to beat up people with it. Nobody had to tell me when God dealt with me and I I started cutting hair. &gt;&gt; Now, it's starting to fall out. Amen. Praise the Lord. I got a ball spot back here. My wife said, but I don't worry about that. So, I'm I'm 100 going on 90. So, see where else? Go ahead. He says death reigns as a result. When you think of death raining in our life, we got sickness, we got heartache and troubles, trying to pay the bills, all kinds of stuff we got to deal with, trying to work for people. I mean everything we do spiritual battles by the fall of one man uh we inherit that fall in sin shape iniquity come speaking lies the fall of Adam has if if the fall of Adam has that much power how much more the blood of the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; you think all the stuff that we go through the Lord gave me this message several years ago and I've been preaching for a long time but I just learned to use PowerPoint a few years back because when I got in the corporate office and I'll tell you about that in a minute but uh it says heaven shall pass. My word or not pass. But how I got into learning how to do all this stuff because I moved on my own at 16 years old. I rent the sleeping room at $9.25 a week. Burn it. And then we when my wife got married, she come into the convenience store. I worked at in in Claremore. Yeah. No, Tulsa. I worked at a convenience store in Clmore because long skinny guy. That's before I got saved. I'm kind of going back and forth. And uh so she come in and she winked. I winked her back at her. So finally I had the nerve to ask her to see about maybe going for a date and uh I fig how I'm trying to think how it all started but anyway that was the wink and then I thought well I kind of like her you know she kept coming and the good thing is her dad loved milk so he come he said come in every other day he bring milk well she seen how skinny I was so she was bringing me dinner you know she going to try to fatt me up a little bit because I was 118 pounds and 5' 11 And so she seen me sit like that and she kind of felt sorry for him I think you know but but anyway that's how we got started and then she had an ex-boyfriend and he's a big boy and I wasn't really planning on necessarily going to date her or nothing like that. I just liked her and I didn't know where it was going to go to and I was kind of shy and I thought I'm a skinny old runt. She ain't going to want me anyhow. So I kind of just thought about it but all of a sudden this big old boy comes in there. He goes are you going over Susan's? And I wasn't going there. I said as soon as I got to work, he said, "Well, you do. I'll meet you there." I went and he didn't show up. Now, he caught he probably could have tore me up, but don't tell me not to do it. I'll get my little skinny army. And that's how we got together. So, but the Lord ordained it, you know, and then my wife got saved later. So, you know, God God has our our plan, our life. He's got it in his hands. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the things that we go, whatever we go through, the Bible says, "Even the Lord Jesus, though he were a son, he learned obedience by the things he suffered." See, I should be closing pretty soon here. I don't want to wear you all out there. Uh 1 Corinthians 15:45, "And so it is written, the first man, Adam, was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a quickening spirit, bringing life." How about that which not was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and after that which is spiritual. We're born naturally, and then we're born again spiritually. The first man of the earth is earthly. The second man is the Lord from heaven. And as the earth is, such are they also earthly. And as the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And this is my favorite part here. The Lord just showed me this years ago. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a natural process. &gt;&gt; I got this face. I got this what who I am. &gt;&gt; All I did is ate groceries. &gt;&gt; See, and you ate the word of God and you feed on the word of God. And as you feed on the word of God, forsake not the assembling of ourselves together, but the banner of sun mid, but exhorting one another. And even though it's more as we see the day approaching. Now, I know that y'all ain't going to miss no natural meals. &gt;&gt; Oh man, we hungry. We're going to eat cheeseburger. We're going to eat whatever we're going to eat. We're going to eat something. So, the spiritual man's hungry, too. &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible says, "Forsaking not as simply of yourselves together as a matter of some minutes, but exhorting one another and even more as you see the day approaching." Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, that's the importance of church attendance and worshiping God and being together and having a good church that's actually preaching the word of God and not just having garage sales and soup slippers and all kinds of things to raise money for this and raise money for that and we're going to go to youth camp. We're going all kinds of stuff. And nothing against youth camp if it's right, &gt;&gt; but there's a lot of that stuff. It's just money making gimmicks. I've seen everything out there. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Uh, now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does corruption inherit incorruption. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. How many know we're looking forward to a body change? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruption, corrup in incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible that's put on incorruptible, this mortal shall have put on immortalized, then shall be brought to pass that saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks to God, which give us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, before I get into this one here, how many knows that our labor or the things we do, we know that one day, the Bible says the last enemy to be destroyed is death. I'm 72 going on 100. So, the last enemy we destroyed, I always tell people I'm 100, but I don't feel a day over 90. You know, I just play around with them. But I said, well, I'm 72, Grandma's 67, I think. Going to be 68 pretty quick. Still going strong. So, but how many knows uh God is in control? &gt;&gt; And so, we're getting closer to the finish line. &gt;&gt; And it could be the rapture coming anytime. We don't know when it'll be, but we know that when it does happen, we just need to be be ready. Excuse me. Now, I want to point out a few things here. Abraham under was under grace before the law because God called Abraham. God didn't say, "If you do this, this is this." God said,"Abraham, get out from among your country, your kindred to a land that I'll show you, and I will make you a father of many nations." &gt;&gt; There was no law then. Moses was during law under law and the ten commandments. That was his purpose to bring the law. And the Bible says, "Wherefore then servants of law, it was our school master to bring us to Christ." It showed us what right and wrong was. If you go driving down the street and there ain't no stop sign, how do you know you doing anything wrong? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; the law was our school master to bring us to Christ. It shows us what's right, what's wrong, what you should do, what you shouldn't do. That's the purpose of the law. It ain't to condemn you, to destroy you. It just to let you know this is wrong and this is right. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't Adam and Eve. It I mean, it wasn't Adam and Steve. It was Adam and Eve. So, I just threw that extra. But, uh, so the law and grace and grace came by the Lord Jesus Christ. Go next one. Now, to and this is a scripture again that brother John David and them gave me and and got me saved or the Lord did. Romans 9 1-24. It's not him that willth, nor him that runth, but God that shows mercy. So there's a ministration of condemnation that brings condemnation. The devil wants to condemn you. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to beat you down. The devil want he he don't want you out witnessing and out you reaching souls and out working for him. &gt;&gt; So he wants to keep you down as much as he can keep you down. &gt;&gt; But God wants you to get up and rise above all that to where we can go out and win other people to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. You know, the harvest is plentous and the labor is few. &gt;&gt; And the reason why because the devil wants to beat us down. Say we're not worthy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, find where God tells you to be and and get into it. &gt;&gt; So, let's see. Romans 9:1 is that's the next. I say the truth in Christ. I lie not. my my conscience also bearing my witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. This is Paul writing for I could wish that myself were cursed from Christ for my brethren and my kinsmen according to the flesh. He's talking about the Jews who were blinded for our sakes. A lot of people don't understand the Jews were blinded so we could have salvation. We'll have a rapture and then God has a plan. Brother Brandon explained it exactly what's taking place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A lot of people they fight me. They say they say that there is no salvation for the Jews. This is they're not they messed up. Their time's over. &gt;&gt; That is totally false. &gt;&gt; God says that they will be a remnant saved for the Jews and all the all the fathers give me Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Israel, all the way through that. God has a Jewish remnant that'll be saved during the tribulation. &gt;&gt; So, but we're gonna be raptured out before that. &gt;&gt; And that couldn't be too far off the way the devil's fighting. See, Paul said, "I wish myself," verse three, "would be a curse for my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites, of who predated adoption and glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promise, whose are the fathers and from whom concerning the flesh Christ came, who overall God blessed forever." Amen. Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel which are of Israel. Neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children. But in Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is they which are the children of the flesh. These are not the children of God. But the children of God are promised or counted for the seed. For this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived, even by our father Isaac, for the This is the scripture got me in here. For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the perfect of God according to election might stand, not of works, but him that callst. The elder shall serve the younger. Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. &gt;&gt; How many knows there was two seeds in the garden, Cain and Abel, Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob and Esau. All through the Bible, you have the the the true and the false. True and the false, true and the false. It's also and that's why you got people that are wicked. So I absolutely believe serpent seed. There is serpent seed. &gt;&gt; You won't reach the serpent seat. But if you can reach out, you will reach a child of God who has something in their heart that can change. And you can't judge who's who. &gt;&gt; You don't know who's going to be who. You'll be a surprise. Some of the people get saved that was on it looked like they were bad seed, but they got mixed up in the wrong crowd. So we can't judge that either. We just preach the gospel to every creature. &gt;&gt; And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. &gt;&gt; So he said, uh, what shall we say then? Is there an righteousness of God? God forbid. For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will comp have compassion. So it's not of him that willth, nor of him that runth, but God that shows mercy. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy. For the scripture said unto Pharaoh, now notice Pharaoh was raised for a purpose. Brother Brandon explained all these things to us in such a I mean you thank God for the message that a prophet of God appointed all we we wouldn't see this without a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; I ain't smart enough. None of us smart enough. God always has a major prophet. Amos Amos 3:7. Surely the go Lord God did nothing but he first reveal a secret to his servants of prophets. &gt;&gt; And people fight a prophet. They don't they don't the reason they fight it. They don't want to know what he said. They don't want to have to adhere to it. But a seed of God will say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "For the scripture, and that my name might be declared to all the of the earth. Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hardens?" I will say then, why does he yet have thought? For who hath resisted his will? But oh man, who art thou that replies against God? Shall the thing form say to him that formeth, "Why have you made me thus?" I said, "Lord, why'd you make me like this here? Why did you make me 5'11 and skinny and I didn't get no muscles? He made me He made me be what I am. &gt;&gt; I can run the cash register. I can I'm a salesman. I was a salesman as a little boy. I I sold when I was a young boy, I sold donuts door to door and then I sold uh Christmas cards. We lived in New Mexico. My stepdad was in the Air Force. I never knew my real dad, but but my my in the Air Force. So, but anyway, I'd go when I was in New Mexico, I just kind of going back and forth a little bit, but I remember I wanted to sell Christmas cards, but I wanted to go to the Mexican side of town because my my mama was Mexican and I'm half Mexican. And so, I wanted to go to the Mexican side. So, I asked the teacher, I said, "Could you teach me how to say you want to buy Christmas cards in Spanish because I'm going to go across the tracks and I'm going to sell Christmas cards." And you order them from a deal, you know. So, he taught me for two or three weeks. Then I finally learned and I learned it and I picked I picked it up while I was ready to roll. I took my little book down there and first house I went to I knocked on the door little Mexican woman come out. I go get confir today son. Praise the Lord. But anyway, I don't did that and then I sold uh I remember when I was young in Tennessee when we move my stepdad was in the air force so we moved a lot. I was in Tennessee and I I was a long hair dippy. I have my beads on, have my peace sign, all that stuff. I'd walk everywhere and and that's when I kind of leaned toward Pentecost. I was trying to find out. So I went to this Pentecost revival and uh and I it was like a tent thing they had going and I went in there and sat on the back row. It was out in the open and the preacher come up to me says, "Can I help you young man?" I said, 'Well, I wanted to come to your revival and kind of check things out. See what's going on. He go, I'll tell you something, young man. He said, 'Go get yourself a haircut and get some decent clothes on. This is the house of God. You just get on out of here and come back later. So, I never to go back. So, see, God God was dealing with me. But some of these so-called preachers, man, they don't have a clue. The Bible says many false prophets shall arise and deceive many. But thank God that one day the eagles cry. Amen. They say, "Oh man, who art thou that replies against God? Shall the thing for form said to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter of power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel under honor and another under dishonor?" So we know there going to be both of those. What if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afford prepared to glory? He had afford prepared even us whom he has called. Not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. Believe it or not, I only had 38 slides, but and then this should be the last one. Galatians 4:19. My little children of whom I travail in birth until Christ be formed in you. Is that it? This Oh, two more. Okay. I hope I ain't boring y'all too much. &gt;&gt; As a born again Christian, we are we we attend church. I mean, you know what? If I don't go to the gas station to get gas, I had to get gas before I come down here. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I had to keep an eye on my gas level. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if I didn't put it in there, in fact, we went to Texas here recently last weekend. I hadn't been on the road in so long. I hadn't drove because and I don't see that good at night. So, I don't drive at night hard anymore. And uh I'm not quite to the nursing home age, but I'm, you know, I get to I got issues. So, but anyway, my aunt talked us into driving down there. And so, I drove down there and I' been it been like six years since I've been out of Barsville pretty much. I mean, just a little here and there, maybe aua, but I was kind of nervous, but my aunt said, "Come on." And we wanted to see little Joanna and we want to meet and all that. So, I said, "Okay, we're going to go." So, we we left. I got off work at Fry and we drove that evening and got all the way down. And I was getting lost. All the roads is all different. I ain't never I ain't even been to Tulsa in so long. I was trying to figure out all these robes and I had all this construction going like that and I was like nervous. I didn't want to let my wife know because I'm driving, you know, but I was going I was like scared. Oh boy, I got to turn this way this and here's the car. I can't see that way. And I finally get through that big old mess. And we got down to the Indian Nation turnpike back in the day when I used to travel all the time. I'd go everywhere. And the thing is they had a little towate you pull off. So what did I do? I get on the Indian Nation turnpike and I pull off at the first exit thinking I'm going to a toe gate. What did I get off at and exit? So, I had to go 10 miles, come all the way back and then get back on it again. I was looking for a toll gate. That but that's history. We don't have that no more. But anyway, I drove I drove down there. You know, things change. But but that got me a little bit more getting back out again because we've been kind of secluded where we're we're at there. And so last time I come here, I got lost. You remember? &gt;&gt; My little granddaughter says, "Grandpa, don't you get lost again." She told me she was going to come, but you I thought, well, I have a hard time keeping up with her. And of course, grandma's got stuff she got to do and stuff. And and I thought, well, I'll just come down myself. But I said, "Grandpa, don't you get lost." But anyway, I came up today and of course I just flowed. And then, of course, 18. I had my little thing on my card that tells me this, that, and the other, and I got right here. &gt;&gt; It was smooth. So, thank the Lord for that. Uh, one more. I think there's one more in this keys to victory. We must have a solid foundation to build our Christian walk on the pure word of God. And thank God for a prophet because everybody thinks they got the pure word. The church of Christ thinks they got it. The Baptist think they got the Methodist think got all of them think they got it. God has it. And and again, I think we should respect every Christian. Whatever brain they are, we don't worry about no brains. In fact, when I when I I had took off over my grandpa's church for about three years here while a few years ago, I forget how long it was. I was going to be the pastor. Well, my grandpa and grandma was oldfashioned Methodist and my my uh my grandma's hair down to the floor. She wrote a bun and had all they're good solid Methodists, you know, and so when I got down there, I told told them I said, "I helped you get to church." And we wrote to the Methodist church and I'm grandpa's grandson and see Morales and we went through all that and and after three years, they give us the building and everything. Well, my cousins and all them come to me later. was they used to always when church was over they go hey how many's going to the casino today I woo so I said man this ain't no good so I I was trying to teach them all of it well they didn't like it but yet they knew we was in the process of getting to church so they let they let it happen at I'm not being recorded them it's okay I've already told them anyway but I but but I said uh I said uh you Well, my aunt claimed to be be a woman preacher and they waited till we got the church officially and it was signed over to us. And so I thought, well, getting ready to get things moving, you very next day after we got it official, one of my aunts who calls herself a win preacher, she says, uh, David says, we sure do love you and appreciate getting this church here. Uh, but we we want to we had a meeting last night and we discussed it and we really want you to just quit preaching on casinos and drinking and all that kind of stuff. You know, we you know, we don't need all we just tell us about. So, what am I supposed to preach? Just preach love. Just love. I said, well, I can't do that. She goes, well, she goes, we're having another meeting tomorrow night and we you're invited. They had to without me. You're invited. And said, we'll discuss it. I said, "Well, there's no reason to discuss it cuz I said, you know, y'all, it's your church. Everything in here I brought you, take it, keep it." But I said, "I can't do that." So anyway, we headed we headed, first of all, we headed to a little church in Boswell that I had used to evangelize in years ago. I thought, "Well, I'm down here. I'll just go see if they need somebody," which turns out they didn't have no preacher. And I was trying to share some brother random with them, but I got shut down pretty quick on that. So I thought well you know I told the brother about after three or four weeks I said well it don't look like this is working for me and I don't want to disrupt your church in any way. So I said I think if you can find somebody I let them take over because I said I don't know I'm going to do you any good and he said well brother that's fine. He said it's fine. And a couple days later he called me said we got somebody brother. I fast and I got and of course I left PA system all that stuff there. And so what I said I'll leave that for you if you want it. Oh no no brother. You just come get it. I said well. Yeah. I said, "When you want me, just come in the morning." I mean, he was ready to get me out of there. And bless his heart. So, I went and picked it up and u I got I know I no sooner got in the truck. I'm literally 15 minutes after I got in the truck, I get a phone call from the people that was renting my church that I had up here and they said, "Brother Dave said, we uh want to let you know we we bought us another church. We bought us a church and we're going to be moving out the end of the month." And so, he said, "You got somebody wants to at least it too since you're down there. I said no sis I'm heading back here so I don't want I said that's fine. I mean God just worked another miracle. I've seen so many miracles that God does and he just felt it together because we come back here. I did that for seven years but I'm not a pastor. I'm just outreach. I I rather one-on-one witness and and I let these preachers that know what they're doing on pastoring. But God has done many many good things for us. Um, so I think is that the last one I think? Okay, I think that's it. Is that right, sis? Okay. Your keys to victory. The word rightly divided. We studied the word of God to have a good understanding of what it means to be saved and how much God is for us. The whole armor of God in order to effectively fight the enemy with Ephesians 6:13. Put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to withstand in the evil day. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we sure do appreciate brother uh brother David coming and and ministering and um uh brother brother Roman has always been a an outreach uh witnessing and uh winning souls to the Lord and and he's always been a great inspiration to me and um anywhere that that he can he it does not matter matter what denomination or what uh what church if uh they give he gets the opportunity he goes and shares the hope that is within him and um and so I knew you would be blessed here tonight and we just we just want to say God richly bless you brother David greet sister Susan for us amen um and so we're just we're just so thankful for what the Lord is doing. And you know, truly, we do have um we've all been given different gifts. And um there's one thing that I I've always admired even about Brother Donald. Uh Brother Donald is is a soul winner. He's always witnessing to somebody and uh talking to them about Christ. And I say re remember this as I was trying to bring out this morning. The Lord saved us for a reason. He's called us for a reason. Not not for us just to say, "Okay, now I'm just waiting for heaven." Amen. But we see ourselves in scripture. We see that the anointing is upon us. And I believe that we need to share, Amen. our our our love. share our testimonies, share these things that God has done for us. Don't don't let it be us four and no more. Amen. The church the church is a hospital. Amen. Our our church is is a this place is a is a hospital. And uh it's not a museum. It's a It's a place where the hurting and the broken and the sinners can come and find a living Jesus Christ. And that living Jesus Christ turns around and makes you, deputizes you to cast out devils, to heal the brokenhearted, to heal the sick. Amen. He anoints you to do that. You become Amen. I came broken, but today I am giving what God has given me. You have come broken, but today God has anointed you to go out and to to declare the gospel of Jesus Christ. Aren't you glad for that? You don't have to be a preacher. You don't have to be a a prominent member in the community. All you have to have is a touch from the Lord. And when you have a touch from the Lord, there's somebody outside. There's somebody maybe next door to you. There may be somebody, Amen, that is that is uh across town or you're working with. Somebody needs to hear what Jesus has done for you. Amen. And I I don't think we should just share it with somebody else. We should, but we should have plenty of grace for one another. I need to have plenty of grace for my wife. She needs to have plenty of grace for me. We should have plenty of grace for our children. You children should have plenty of grace for your for your parents. Amen. They the love of God is not just for outside our church or outside our home, but it's the grace of God, the strength of God that is within us, that is within our church, that's within our homes. Amen. And it's that grace of God that has moved upon us that gives us that we need to help those around us. Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Amen. I I I remember as as as uh as brother Roman, you know, was given some of his testimonies and he does have he brother Roman has a lot of testimonies and I've always loved those testimonies over the years. Um, it's sort of like it's sort of like getting around Brother Forest, you know, just a just a lot of testimonies of what God has has done. And uh but you know the zeal I mean uh that that zeal that we that we had you know um even even sister Carol I was 19 when I come to Ponyie you know and uh uh I was just as dumb and stupid as as as as could be. But you know, I had a desire to share to share what I had. That's all I and I didn't have much, but I had Jesus. But you know, I don't tire of telling people about the love of God. In fact, um I'm more I'm I've always been more at home if I'm at oneonone with somebody and um letting them know the love of the Lord and and and reaching out to them. So I say today, don't leave it to the preacher. Don't leave it Don't leave it to uh the deacons or the trustees. [Music] Why don't we win some souls to the Lord today? And u I I believe this message that brother David brought today. Amen. He has changed us from death unto life. And we've got a testimony to tell. Amen. Praise the Lord. Have you enjoyed yourself in the house of the Lord today? Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I um I'm so thankful. Amen. The uh I was trying to think of that song. Matter of fact, let's just sing that the old song. Amazing grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind but now I see. Let's do another verse of that. What was grace that taught oh glory my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved how preious did That grace appear the I first believe. Mercy said no. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. Mercy said no. Sin will never take control. [Music] Life and death stood face to face. Darkness tried to steal my heart away. Thank you, Jesus. Mercy said no. One more time. Mercy said, "No, I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. Mercy said no. Sin will never take control. Life and death stood face to face. Darkness tried to steal my heart away. Thank you, Jesus. Mercy said, "No." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that? Hallelujah. Devil says, "Well, you know, God's brought you so far, but it I don't know. I I still got a hold of you. Why don't you just tell the devil that my name was written in that book and it was a long time before I gave my heart to the Lord? And the reason I gave my heart to the Lord is because my name is in that book. And he's not going to lose me. He's not going to let me go. I love him. I may be struggling. I may be. But I'm here to tell you, I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. And I believe God's grace is upon me. And brother, I just want to let you know that right now. I don't care how bad Satan is fighting you. I don't You say, "Well, I I I'm I'm fighting so hard. I must not be righteous anymore." As brother David put it tonight, there's only one way that you will ever be righteous, and that's by the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's the only way you'll ever be righteous. My righteousness will never do me any good. Well, I've been a preacher now for a long time. Been pastoring now for a long time. That that that equals me a one big zero with God. So, what does that do to me? That that causes me to rely upon the Lord Jesus. I'm relying upon him. He's the one that started me and I'm relying on him to finish me. And sometimes I might miss the mark, but you know what? The blood of Jesus Christ was not for the devil's children. The blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus shed his blood for his sons and his daughters that were lost in sin. So when I make a mistake, you know what I do? I come and I say, "God, forgive me. Wash me again with your blood." And you know what? I'm just as righteous at that point. I don't have to go through all of this this uh uh uh earning my way and I've got to pray for two weeks before I can be forgiven. I can repent and the moment that I repent, God's blood has washed my sins away. Hallelujah. Well, I just want to tell you that's the way the Bible teaches it and that's the way that I believe it. and Satan, you can't condemn me. And I I've got a promise. God's word has already said he will perfect me until the day of his coming. And I just say I'm dumb enough to believe it. Do you believe it? I believe it. Amen. He that has started a good work in you will be faithful to complete it. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. There was just a lot of good word preached here tonight. Amen. Glory to God. God bless you. Uh I didn't I didn't get to mention. Brother Michael mentioned it. I'm glad he did this morning. Uh but we just want to say thank you for for all of the help those who uh uh uh uh who worked so hard uh on that on the ribs the other night uh the other day.
