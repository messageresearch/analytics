that we thank you for all that you do for us commit the remainder of the service into your hands the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen all right let's go ahead and turn to First John chapter 5. foreign first John chapter 5 and starting at verse 2. but this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith you may all be seated we're going to go ahead and turn to Matthew chapter 21. and starting it verse 28 but what thinking a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said Son go work today in my Vineyard he answered and said I will not but afterward he repented and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said I go sir and he went not wither of them Twain did the will of his father they say unto him the first Jesus saith unto them verily I say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you for John came unto you in the way of righteousness and you believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that you might believe him so this is a parable that I think we all know we've all heard it many times it was covered in in Sunday school when we were younger and when we first look at it it's not what you would necessarily call um a deep or hard to understand Parable um but it's been something that stayed in my mind and so I started looking at it from from other directions you know here we have the very uh easy look it's here Jesus is talking to the the religious leaders of the day and he's telling this parable of the two sons and he's holding up basically here you have those that said that they were going to do what they what they were asked the religious leaders that yes they say they're going to worship God they say they're going to do this and do that but yet they don't go forward and then you have those that they refuse to begin with but then through the preaching of John these Republicans and these Sinners begin to repent and begin to come back and begin to live like they were supposed to and so it was a Jesus was looking at the religious leaders and calling them out for the way that they were acting and it's interesting to look at it because as he's speaking to these religious leaders you know to to be a part of the priesthood they had to know their scriptures forward and backwards they knew every single thing there and so they knew what was said in in Deuteronomy about the stubborn and rebellious son in Deuteronomy chapter 21 and starting at Verse 18 it says if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the Elders of his City and unto the Gate of his place and they shall say unto the Elders of a city this is our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard and all the men of his City shall Stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put away evil from among you and all Israel shall hear and fear now I have a hard time imagining a parent actually doing this I have a hard time imagining that this was a common place happening even when they had children that were being rebellious it's difficult to imagine that they were going so far the parents are like all right we're taking you to be stoned it's over but yet as Jesus is talking to these religious leaders they know that this is the scripture here and so as he's giving this Parable and he's talking about first you have this oldest that starts off by saying no I'm not going to go and so you know when when you look at at Israel Israel was a patriarchal society um and the children were expected to follow in the footsteps of their father um you can go through the scriptures and find Eli's Sons followed him into the priesthood Samuel's Sons were appointed judges over Israel Peter and Andrew learned fishing from their father the same as James and John learned fishing from their father John the Baptist was expected to follow in the footsteps as his father as a priest before his calling Into the Wilderness um and so if you've just stepped back and look and think about the story for a moment think about it as it's going here this father comes and he's got his his sons that he's been training that he's been teaching and Jesus doesn't go into details about the family maybe it was more of a poor family and so the father was doing all the instructing on his own just the father and mother teaching the children maybe it was a family that they had more money and so he had you know his brother Branham talked about having them put under tutors that would teach for a while and train them and get them ready to to take on the the father's business and Father's responsibility and so finally we come to this point where the father is coming into a place to test them he's coming into the point to invite them into the family business to invite them to take part you know this Parable he talks about it being the vineyard so this family had a Vineyard this was how he supported the family this was how the father made the money that would buy the food that would clothe them that would take care of them the way the family worked that would take care of the elderly that was in his family maybe his parents couldn't work anymore and so the vineyard was how he provided for them maybe there were still other younger children that was how he provided for them everything was wrapped around this family business and so the father is now inviting his children to come in and begin to take their place helping to provide and so he goes to his oldest the firstborn the sun with the most pressure and the most responsibility upon him the firstborn was the one that the most was expected of him I mean the fact that they were both sons they both had expectations but that oldest was always the one that was looked on as this is the one that's going to take over everything this is the one that when the father dies he's going to take on the mantle of taking care of the entire family he's the one that's going to take on this responsibility of protection a provision and so he comes to his oldest and he says son go work in my Vineyard and his son looks at him and goes no I don't feel like it today I don't want to you can think about how this conversation went maybe it was a very simple statement maybe it can be dramatized more to where this son goes on a rant I hate the vineyard I hate that we're always out there I want to go fishing I want to go do this I want to go do that but the father comes and he asks his son to come do the work and his son says no and can you just imagine the father as he's looking at his eldest the one who he's expecting to take on everything and just that look of disappointment that comes on his face Jesus doesn't tell us that the father went into a lecture that he went in to let me tell you how you're wrong or let me berate you or let me yell at you but knowing how parents work even though he didn't say a word just that look of disappointment and just think of the Father's Heart as his son looks at him tells him no and just that disappointment in his heart going I thought he would be better thought he would step up more I thought that I could trust him at this point that's why I came to ask him to come work in the vineyard I thought he was ready and so he then goes on to the next one he goes on to his second son and he says the exact same thing son go work in the vineyard and the second son says I will go sir he's you know he's absolutely let me step up let me do it he's being polite he's calling him sir he's being respectful he's doing all the things he's supposed to and you can see the father walk away from that conversation like okay I've got one son that's that's where he's supposed to be that's starting to do the things that I want to but the story doesn't stop there it keeps going because this second son that was so quick to say I will go sir gets distracted or he gets busy or he gets lazy or he gets take your pick the Jesus didn't go into details on exactly why he doesn't go he just says but he didn't go and so we're taking this into more of a real story for a moment it's like if I went to my children and so I'm talking to Paul and he says I will go but then he gets distracted because he wants to build this really cool castle with his Legos and he's like I'll go once this is done but then his little brother comes in and breaks the castle and so he's got to rebuild it and he's going through this whole thing and he had the best of intentions to go but he got wrapped up in some other concerns he got wrapped up in some other cares he got wrapped up in other things that were going on and so it wasn't necessarily that he had bad intentions he didn't necessarily go into it with well I'm going to lie to my father and tell him that I that I'll go but I really not but things around him kept him from doing it but then the eldest son the son that had said point blank to his dad no that it looked him straight in the eye and gone no I'm not gonna go the scriptures say he repented and so we started thinking about it and maybe he was thinking about that look of disappointment that he'd seen flash over his father's face and maybe he was thinking about some of the things that he had studied in Bible school or some of the things that he'd heard in Sunday school or the last sermon the rabbi had preached or but it said he repented and he went into the vineyard was like all right I'll put in the day's work I'll do what I was asked to do even though I said no even though I said I wouldn't do it I'm going to step in and I'm going to do the work Charles Spurgeon wrote and said the second son said I go sir but he went not and these people do not go they talk of repenting but they do not repent they speak of believing but they never believe they think of submitting to God but they have not submitted themselves to him yet they say it is time they broke up the fallow ground and sought the Lord but they do not seek Him it all ends in a mere promise it's very easy for us as Christians to go and be like hey I've said that I will go work I'm I'm here at church I'm attending service I'm I've accepted Christ as my savior I'm here it's easy for us to say yes I've I've told God yes I've told him I will do the work I will go out on the vineyard I will do my part but then yet when Christ comes and begins to call you to do something specific begins to tell you to to do certain things how easily we become distracted how easily we've become focused on other things that are going around other things that are happening in our lives and sometimes there what could be classified as important things and sometimes it's the castle of Legos sometimes it's something like man I've got to go to work I've got to provide for my family I've got to make you know I've got to put in a little bit extra overtime to make sure that we pay this bill or cover this expense or do this or do that sometimes it can be what we could classify as important and sometimes it can be well you know it's the season the fish are biting so I've got to be out at the lake Deuteronomy chapter 11 and verse 1. it says therefore Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgments and his Commandments always in Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and verse 13. it says let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man throughout the scriptures God gives us instruction for our lives he instructs his children about their inheritance he tells us about the quality of the land he tells us how to prosper and he tells us the borders that have been established for our protection the boundary of our land don't cross it because you have no claim to what's on the other side this is your land this is your promise this is the family business I want to invite you into I'm not inviting you to go work on that property it may look better maybe it looks greener it looks nicer but that's not where I'm asking you to work because it's not ours you don't get the blessings from over there you get the blessings from staying in these boundaries and staying Within These guidelines in Genesis chapter 22 we have the story of Abraham going to sacrifice his son and we're not going to go ahead and read through the whole story but he goes and he just tells his wife we're going to sacrifice he's not going to tell her God told me to sacrifice the boy but they go he tells the men that have traveled with him the boy and I will go Yonder and the boy and I will return he goes up onto the mountain he his son is asking him questions as all of us parents know our children do all the time and sometimes there are questions that we really don't want to answer at the moment there are things we don't want to go into and so Isaac's asking where's the sacrifice and so Abraham tells him but doesn't tell him says God will provide the sacrifice he doesn't tell him you're the sacrifice he just says God will provide so they go up they construct the altar they go through everything he binds his son puts him onto the altar raises the knife and then the angel of the Lord appears and tells them all right now now I know and in verse 18 of Genesis 22 the angel speaking to him says and in thy Siege shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice obedience brings about blessing keeping the Commandments of the Lord brings about blessing in our life when we're called we have the option to be like either of those Sons and we have the option to repent if we started off wrong like the oldest son if we went and we said no I'm not doing that we have the opportunity to repent we have the opportunity to go and do the work that we've been called to abide by The Commandments that we've been given in the sermon expectation brother Branham says is speaking and says God said separate yourself from your kindred that's what you have to do a lot of times separate yourself from a lot of unbelief and remember until Abraham fully obeyed God the blessing never come until he fully obeyed God he took his daddy along and he caused trouble and then lot finally caused trouble and a herdsman and then as soon as he got separated from everything like God had told him he fully obeyed when he come to full obedience then God brought the blessing in the token brother Branham says when you fully obey the word of God in full surrender to it you're entitled to the Token yes sir obedience not he that saith Lord Lord but he that doeth the will and when we pray we must have the token present with our prayer and in the sermon influence he says I am your brother but he said the works that I do shall you do also is that what he said all right if he is here his spirit is here that was what makes him then if we can surrender ourselves and get our own thoughts away just like this has no thoughts that another voice can speak through it that's the way if we can empty ourselves out there is the secret get rid of yourself get rid of your own thinking get rid of your own ways then let God move if he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you believe it you believe him right now and see if it is and finally in the sermon the the conflict between God and Satan the word of God there's no way around fortified all the way around everywhere thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord you're walking you're talking your business you're associating and everything put the word of God first say I believe I'll go tonight and this little dance just won't hurt anybody could you take thus saith the Lord with you see I believe if I could pull this little deal oh it's just a bit Shady but could you say thus saith the Lord with it always take him first keep fortified for he is our Fortress it's strain but do you know you have to before you have to ignore in order to believe the devil's lie you have to ignore and deny God's truth first before you can believe the devil's lie you ever think of that you have to deny the truth first before you could believe a lie right you have to deny it and so this Parable is on the one hand super simple very easy to look at very good this is specifically who Jesus was talking about but I'm not one that goes in lows okay I think the only reason God put this in the scripture was to apply to something that happened thousands of years ago and it has basically no Up application or a life anymore it's not the way the Bible works and so this Parable was just bouncing around in my head and just couldn't seem to get away from thinking about it and we as Christians we have the opportunity where God calls us to live the certain way to abide by his Commandments to abide by his guidelines and we stand there and both of these are Sons both of these are his children it doesn't say that one was a servant they're both his sons and when God comes and he calls us to do something he reveals something out of his scriptures he reveals something maybe we haven't heard this one before we haven't seen that before we all know how you can take one verse and read it over and over and over and then based on what you're going through in life you'll pick up something a little different out of it because it applies a little differently to what you're going through versus what I used to go through you know as an 18 year old there were only so much many things I would get out of this then I became a husband then I became a father then I somehow became a minister then I somehow became a deacon and these different things where suddenly I'm in a different place in life and there are things in the scriptures that stand out to me now that as an 18 year old kid didn't stand out I still read the exact same Bible and it didn't change what was in there God hasn't suddenly input new chapters in the book there's nothing new in here it's the same as what was but the way I see it has changed because of where I'm at and so something new will pop out in the scriptures because of where we're at in life of what we're going through or because God's giving us a little more revelation and we then have that opportunity to stand there and go okay am I going to accept this am I going to take the word that I'm being given am I going to take the instruction that I'm being shown or am I going to say no and then even beyond that the first reaction it's easy as we're sitting here in church to be yelling amen and shouting preach it and yes that's exactly the truth and then walk out the doors and go can I really live that can I really do that or am I going to allow myself to be distracted by everything else that's going around it's easy to be in this environment and saying yes Lord I'll go yes I'm going to change that about my life yes I'm going to throw this to the side or I'm going to do that and then walk out those doors and go back into our house where there's no one else around us and become distracted or go you know maybe it really wasn't that important maybe it's not that big a deal and be like the second son that so quickly was like yes sir I will go but then didn't Jesus says he's telling this Parable was pointing out that the actions matter more he asked them he asked the the leaders of that day is like which one did the will of the father and they said the first the one who had the bad attitude to start the one who was sitting in church with their arms folded across their chest going I don't want to hear that I have zero desire to listen to that but then yet when they walked out I love that this word is used in the scripture says he repented meaning that he went and was like all right I'm going to turn around and go the opposite direction of the way I was going he had made the choice to walk against the father's teaching he had made the choice because father wants me to go that way I'm going to be like Jonah and I'm going this direction but then he hit the point the scripture says he repented and so he turned back around and it went the opposite direction of the way he was going he was like I will go and I will work in the vineyard I will do what my father asked me what my father commanded me because that's what I'm called for because I am the eldest son this is my role this is my position this is where God has placed me and this is what's expected of me it's easy in the church as we're sitting here and everyone else around us is amening and we're all happy and we're all smiling it's easy to say yes it's not easy for it to stay a yes as we walk out the doors because then we go back into the environment that had caused the problem to begin with we go back around those influences we go back whether it's at work whether it's things in our home whether it's friendships whether it's whatever but it's easy to say yes here but Jesus was pointing out that the one that was in the church that had the bad attitude that showed the disrespect and everything else was actually the one that did it right in the end so just because we're sitting here in church and we look around and we're like boy they're praising they've got their hands up all as well and then we look at other people in church go well they're not getting anything out of this boy look at that scowl on their face and we're caught ourselves judging them we could be watching one of these Parables happen where maybe they didn't receive it with the best attitude maybe they didn't take the instruction the way that they should have but they ended up repenting and turning around and going back the way they were supposed to Matthew Chapter 7 and verse 21 we have a another Parable that Jesus talks about of those that are building the houses not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it he says very clearly whosoever heareth these sayings of mine whoever hears my Commandments whoever hears what I've said and does them not just responds well in the midst of the service not just puts on a good show but the one who actually hears the instruction and goes and does it he will be the wise man we're the one that hears it and doesn't do it maybe they were able to put on the great face maybe they were able to celebrate maybe they were able to dance maybe they were able to do all these things then on the outward looks so good but they don't actually do it they will be like the foolish man that built upon the sand that will crumble and will fall Second Chronicles chapter 7 and verse 14. I've heard this scripture quoted so many times by people out in the world even on saying if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and we'll hear their land thing is out in the world everybody's real quick to go here we'll seek his face maybe we'll even humble ourselves but the Turning from the wicked way is a little bit much but God gives us the formula says very clearly if you do these things then I will hear from heaven and I'm not real concerned about the entire land first I'm going selfishly what about me I need you to take care of me first then we'll see how the rest of it goes we'll see how everything else but I have to make sure I'm right first and so I have to humble myself I have to seek his face I have to follow his Commandments and then he will forgive their sin and heal their land Luke chapter 11 and verse 28 but he said yay rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it John chapter 14 and verse 15 it says if you love me keep my Commandments Romans chapter 12 starting at verse 1. I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove who is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it if you love me keep my Commandments present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God well if it's holy and acceptable unto God then you have to be hearing the word and keeping it you have to be keeping the Commandments that's the only way it's going to be holy and acceptable Psalms 84. and verse 11. for the Lord God as a son and shield the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly O Lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee no good thing will he uphold from those that walk uprightly blessed is the man that trusteth in thee throughout the scriptures God keeps telling us over and over and over keep my Commandments do what I'm telling you it's the father that continues to instruct his sons continues to tell them continues to help them develop so that he can then call them into the family business God's trying to teach us he's trying to school us he's trying to show us where we're supposed to live how we're supposed to live so that we can then be that trustworthy son that has the ring and his signature is as good as the fathers on every single check that he writes because he's proven himself to be trustworthy he's proven himself to be acceptable he's proven himself to be thinking and making decisions the same way the father would the father doesn't have to wonder is he going to go off on some Bender drinking and wasting all his money he knows the Sun is going to go out and maybe he's going to look at the business deal and go you know I think I should invest in this versus that great has a little bit different look at things that way but he's not going I'm going to waste all my money I'm going to live sinfly I'm going to do this he's still making the decisions based on how am I going to take care of the family how am I going to take care of the elderly in my family how am I going to take care of the young ones in my family how because he's now The Trusted son that his father can trust him to make those decisions because he's been doing what he was instructed he's been proving himself over and over Branham says in the sermon the comforter he says don't you never forget the Comfort the stream of all my comfort the stream of my comfort tonight is I know that God keeps his word I know that something happened to me I know that I've passed from Death unto life I know that I keep his Commandments if you love me keep my Commandments he said if you love me do what I tell you to do let every man's word be a lie let mine be true don't follow what man said follow what God Said and there you find the comforter and the Comfort brings you the satisfaction of knowing it's thus saith the Lord laughs foreign he says in the sermon respects he says over in Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter and the 13th verse it's written like this see let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of man the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and when you cannot have respects until you have fear you've got to have fear of God Solomon said so also in the Proverbs that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom now that don't mean that you're afraid of him but it means that you're giving him respect and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian see you've got before you can have respects you've got to have fear and God demands it he demands respects God does he demands it and fear brings it we know that fear brings respects Proverbs chapter 9 and verse 10 which is what brother Brandon was referencing says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding in the Ephesians Church age book a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church began to lose the first love of God in first John 5 3 he says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments his word one little deviation from that word was a step away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time but when it's all over watch and see if they are in that word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and they don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people saying they loved God but not obeying his word and in the sermon how can I overcome and there is a third dispensation now like Noah's time lot's time and now this time there is an ark now and that Ark is not a denomination neither it is is it good works that you do it's by one Spirit Romans 8 1 we are all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome it's all that is under the shed blood is Overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcomes for you you're resting How will I know then brother Branham that I'm in there watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull see then you're doing it but don't try to do it did you ever try yeah don't it's just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole you see he's just up down over and everything else see he can't do it put on your coat honey he can't do it little arm is up down around it takes you your Steady Hand oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to Father saying Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put the coat on I quit trying just let him do it see if the little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it he's just everywhere he can't do it neither can you neither can I but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him here Lord here I am just let me be nothing you put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't we have to get to the point where we're thinking the same thoughts as Christ where we're speaking the same words as Christ where we're living the life that Christ is calling us to for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous he hasn't given us Commandments that are designed to hurt you he hasn't given you Commandments that are designed to cause you problems he hasn't given you Commandments that are unacceptable he hasn't given you Commandments that are that don't make sense he hasn't asked anything of you that is unreasonable he gives you these Commandments and just like his children when our parents would tell us to do things and at certain ages we would go why are they telling us this I'm 10 years old I know better than that why shouldn't I go jump off the roof of the house I'll be fine look I've got a sheet it's gonna be a great parachute why shouldn't I do this and the parents are going don't do it you're going to get hurt you're not allowed to do this then you get a little bit older you get into your teenage years and maybe you're like all right my parents had a little more wisdom about that I shouldn't jump off the roof but why can't I go hang out with this crowd of people why can't I go and do this why can't I do that my parents don't really understand what they're talking about then you get a little bit older start going wow my parents were smarter than I thought they were they knew a little bit more than I thought they were and we keep going through that where as we begin to get older and more mature we go wow my parents were actually pretty smart they knew what they were telling us about they weren't giving me instruction without a purpose they weren't telling me that I shouldn't do this simply because they didn't want me to have fun which is what we think is kids we go you just want me to have fun you don't want me to have a good time you don't want me to enjoy myself but the parents are telling you no I'm trying to save you from hurt whether it's hurt in the moment from jumping off the roof or it's hurt that will develop over time from hanging with the wrong crowd I'm giving you instruction I'm giving you guideline to protect you and then we when we see that happen over and over children to adults how can we then as human beings look at God and say no your instructions don't make sense I know better than you do we already see it acted out over and over children's parents which is only a gap of 20 years but yet we as human beings sometimes think that we can look at God and go no that doesn't make sense and there's a gap of timelessness eternity between the way we think and the way God thinks God isn't giving us instruction that are Grievous he isn't putting things out there to hurt us or to just prevent us from having a good time he's protecting us he's watching over us as the loving father and so when we love him we keep his Commandments when we love him we do what he asks us to do it's the same thing as I remember I worked for uh a really good guy at one of the the Chick-fil-As a while back and he had a policy that I can it's just wisdom anyway but after getting to know him and his wife I pretty much guarantee his wife told him this is what I'm comfortable with where he had a policy he would never be in a room alone with a woman even in the office at a restaurant which there's this big old window nothing could happen that wasn't seen there were cameras all this stuff that door was propped open the door was not closed there was no way where he was going to be in a closed environment with the woman whether it was married single didn't matter and this is one of the things that his wife had said this is what would make me uncomfortable great I'm going to abide by that because I love my wife I fear her I respect her I'm not going to go out of my way to hurt her and in most marriage relationships I think that there are those kind of guidelines that have been put in place where you know this is the kind of thing that would bother my husband or my wife and so I don't do that because I don't want to hurt my spouse I don't want to go past that barrier where they've said this is kind of the boundary line of what would make me comfortable or uncomfortable sometimes that has to do with protecting the marriage covenant self sometimes it just has to do with safety maybe the husband loves doing Daredevil type activities he likes to go hiking on these really impressive trails and rock climbing and all this kind of stuff and so his wife is like okay I can I can let you go out this far do what you do what you feel like you this is just what you enjoy but this is the point where it crosses over into I'm no longer comfortable with you doing it this is this is that red line you can do all this stuff be thrill seeking do all those things just don't go don't go past that red line and God gives us those instructions goes here's the red line if you love me keep my Commandments don't go past the red line don't go past the Border don't go out of our land out of our property you can do everything up to the line everything in this area it's yours just don't go past the line that's what the Commandment is for Luke Chapter 11 nope sorry I already read through some of these praise the Lord you know as brother Brandon's telling the the story of the the baby putting trying to put its arm into the coat every parent knows this every parent's been through this as they're trying to get their little one dressed and he's wiggling and he's moving and he's doing all these different things or when they start to get the age where they want to be independent and they want to do it themselves but they're not quite ready and you might let them try to put on the coat by themselves for a little bit and you see them getting more and more frustrated with it as they're trying to do it on their own and then finally you step in as the parent go here let me help let me show you how to get it in and brother Ram as he's talking about the story and how we can overcome it's we're supposed to be able to rest we don't overcome because of our own abilities we don't overcome because of our own power we don't overcome because of Our Own Strength we overcome because we choose to surrender to him and so when we're struggling with different things when we're struggling with some of these Commandments with some of these instructions with some of these guidelines that we've been given we have to rest back into him and go all right Lord this is where you've drawn that red line I need to rest in you and stay away from it I need you to be the one that takes control and shows me how to put my arm in that sleeve how to not keep going across that red line how to not keep making this mistake over and over I need to surrender to you and let you take control it's like I mentioned multiple times the goal is for us to begin to speak the same words that he gave us to begin to think the same thoughts to begin to move into the place where our reactions are the same as Christ where people would look at you as a mature believer and go that's Christ I've had a few of those people in my life I know my wife's probably thinking the exact same name I am right now but we've had different ones through our through our lives where you look at this mature brother or mature sister in the church and you go if I had to pick somebody that is like Christ on Earth right now that's the person because they have gotten to that point where they are surrendered and they are simply loving those around them and they are living the way God calls them to and there's never a question about are they going to cross at the red line they don't have the slightest inclination to go anywhere near the red line that's what God's calling each one of us to be each one of us to get to is to be that person that on the job site people will look at you and go that's Christ here or at school or at home or at church that others feelings of that's the kind of believer I want to be that's somebody that is modeling Christ as the musicians come Psalms 111 and verse 6 it says he hath showed his people the power of His works that he may give them the heritage of the heathen The Works of his hands are Verity and judgment all his Commandments are sure they stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness he sent Redemption unto his people he hath commanded his Covenant forever holy and Reverend is his name the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding of all they that do his Commandments his praise endureth forever the psalmist writing says all his Commandments are sure if he told you to do it there's no question there's no doubt there's no chance that he told you the wrong thing if he gave you this instruction if he gave you this commandment then it's sure it's the rock that you can build on because there's no shakiness to it it's the strong Foundation because his Commandments are sure they stand fast forever and ever and not only are they sure and stand fast but they are done in truth and uprightness he didn't put this down with bad intentions it was truth and uprightness he gave you these Commandments because he's trying to protect you because he's trying to take care of you because he's trying to guide you it's not because he's trying to keep you away from something that he should allow you to have and then it's the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his Commandments if you're doing his Commandments and you're doing it with the honest loving heart you have the good understanding you go I know God gave me this instruction for a reason maybe I don't fully understand it yet maybe I don't understand why he told me but I still can know that it's because God loves me at this point I'm now I'm loving God and trusting he loves me and whether I understand that or not understand the instruction understand the Commandment I can know the spirit that it's given in there are times that we as children did that with our parents it's like I didn't necessarily understand every instruction that I was given I didn't necessarily understand every guideline that my parents had taught me and there were times when I didn't have the Holy Ghost yet and I was still relying on them to be the Holy Ghost because I was going I'm not doing this I'm not getting into trouble there because my parents told me not to do this even though down the inside I still wanted to but I had that guideline I had that guard rail that was there and I had enough trust in my parents at that age to go I'm not going to do it now if you someone asked me at that age I tell them I can't do that because my mom will kill me but it was also that I knew they cared for me if my mom and dad told me this thankfully I was old enough at that point to go okay I can accept they're telling me for a reason brother random said in the sermon things that are to be he said Christians I may never see you again see it's years since I've been here may never see you again line up with God's word look in the mirror like a little boy one time has been out in the country never seen a mirror he came to his Auntie's house he started walking up the steps he's seen a mirror and he's seen a little boy in the mirror he kept walking up looking and he would wave and the little boy would wave and he kept looking he never seen himself in a mirror so when he got close enough he turned around he said why mama that's me how do you look in God's mirror does it reflect a daughter or a son of God is there something which you hear that doesn't make you hate the man that's saying it or there's something pull say I know that man is right because that's in the scripture the Commandments are laid out there and we can be like the first son and we can be sitting in church with our arms crossed and a scowl on our face hating every word that the minister is saying because we don't want to accept it foreign but it didn't stop there because Jesus in the story makes it very clear he repented he may have had a poor attitude at the beginning he may have not wanted to hear the instruction he may not have wanted to hear what the father was telling him but he was willing to repent and he was willing to then go do what he had been told to go do what the father was telling him to do and I think this is something that repeats in our lives over and over and over this isn't something that is just for those that they haven't yet accepted Christ as their savior this isn't just for those that are new to church this isn't for those that are still growing up that are kids this is something every one of us faces over and over because God keeps unveiling his word a little more and revealing a little more to you and showing a little more to you based on what you're going through and you have the choice on how you accept it and then what you actually take action on we can be the person sitting there with a scowl we can be the person sitting there smiling and praising and joining in with everyone else but Jesus made it clear what matters is what happens after that after we walk out those doors after we go back into our life do we repent and we take action on the instruction we've been given do you repent and follow the command that God gave us or do we allow ourselves to be distracted or focused on other things and never follow through on the instruction we were given the parable manifests over and over and over through our lives and probably each one of us at some point has been the first son and at some point has been the second son we've been both you can't tell me that well I've only ever done this side of the parable because I'm not going to believe you but eventually if we're Christians we're going to end up in the slot of the first son because we're going to repent we're going to end up turning back to follow the commands we've been given because we are his sons we are his children [Music] and if I'm really his child then I'm going to turn and do what I've been taught and do what God has instructed in me and do what the Commandments are thank you for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments let's pray Lord Jesus Lord this wasn't a shouting sermon this wasn't full of excitement this wasn't necessarily entertaining enjoyable foreign Lord if it makes us look in the mirror of your word for a few moments if it makes us look at our lives and and think about the decisions we're making if it makes us look in that mirror to see am I am I standing as a Son of God or as a daughter of God or am I resenting the word that's coming forth from the ministers or the scriptures that I read them or the prophet as I listen Lord if we're walking the wrong direction if we're we're being that second son that's walking away from the Commandments Lord help us to repent help us to turn around and and walk back to where you've instructed us to because Lord your Commandments aren't Grievous they're there for our protection they're there for our growth they're there for our safety Lord I pray that you would help each one of us to examine ourselves and in the mirror of the word just a little bit more Lord help us just to surrender to you and surrender to the commandments so that we can express our love to you because when we love you we would keep your Commandments Lord be in our next little bit of time we have Lord accept our worship Lord Jesus and Lord may you just continue to minister to the hearts I want to do thy will oh God [Music] oh won't you take me and break me move me and make me I want to do thy will
