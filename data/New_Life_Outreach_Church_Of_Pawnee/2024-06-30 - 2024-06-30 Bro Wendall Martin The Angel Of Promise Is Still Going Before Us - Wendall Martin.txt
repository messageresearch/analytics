everyone sitting down with our hearts hanging on the willow trees but I say tonight or this morning he that has begun the good work will be faithful to complete that work this morning I believe God answers prayer I believe God hears every prayer that you pray right there's not one prayer that goes unnoticed there is not one there's not one minute detail of your life that God does not know about that's right he's not answering today there's a reason many of times the reason is is Satan is trying to battle you and mind to cover your mind up and hinder your faith from accepting but I say today we've got to believe God's word and accept God's word regardless of how we feel regardless of what the devil is saying to you regardless amen how the situation looks oblique God is very mindful of you here this morning and I believe that and I know I know he's here today [Music] as we go to the Lord in prayer before we Minister the word this morning I want you to just take your need and I want you to just lift it before the Lord and say Lord I'm you still here I need your touch I need you to work and I I need your blessings father as we heard the song that brother Josh and sister Loretta SU song and as these songs that you have as we have sung here this morning coming into your throne room you've the one that made the miracle you're the one that created a path for us to come before you I'm asking Lord that you would meet every need that is present here this morning I pray that the anointing of the Holy Spirit would come down in such a wonderful way Lord I'm asking father that your word as it is going forth that it would be unhindered and I pray Lord that there would be a faith that would rise greater than ever before for this is the day of rapture we love you father with all of our heart now Lord I ask that you would Minister you see every need that is present you see those that are on the internet those who couldn't make it this morning just ask that you would be with each and every need in the name of the Lord Jesus ask Lord that you would anoint us to minister your word and that the word would come rich and real to every heart and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen amen and amen I'd like to read here in the book of Exodus the 23rd chapter amen and we're just going to read one verse from there and then I also want to read in Philippians 1 and six praise the Lord amen aren't you glad you're a Christian here this morning Hallelujah I'd rather be a Christian than anything else in the world praise the Lord good to have our our friends from uh all the way from Oklahoma City and God bless you all this morning uh so good to see you guys praise the Lord uh Exodus 23 and 20 and it and it says behold I will send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared amen I also want to look there at Philippians the first chapter amen and we're going to read there at the sixth verse being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ now that that is a problem the the angel of the Lord is to take us Amen to the place that he has prepared what is that place amen there in in Revelations 21 and and one I saw a new heavens and a new Earth amen for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I saw that Holy City descending out from Heaven that is a promise and that's what God is taking you to God bless you you can have your seats here this morning amen I want to Minister the angel of Promise is still going before us amen the angel of Promise the one who made the promise now today we see the the world in in in great turmoil and we realize that we need something to Anchor the heart amen there's a lot of emotions that are swirling around and amen constantly we we the of course right now we got the presidential amen uh uh you know things that are that are uh you know the the uh election coming up and amen and and um the world is is is looking at this and wondering and you've got amen um uh According to some that this is the world's greatest economy that we've ever had and um uh you know they were talking about all the lies that Trump told the other night and I thought is anybody looking at a few of them on the other side and amen but you and I are supposed to believe that this is uh amen that we're in a Utopia here today but I I want to say that we are amen that that this life is is is is pretty am man the our nations are are are are crumbling kingdoms are falling amen and and and and the reason it is is because it is built upon Humanity amen and anything about Humanity cannot last there is no continuing City here there's nothing that is continuing here on the Earth the only hope that we have is in the Lord Jesus Christ and I say here this morning that you amen are just as fickle as they are amen except for the grace of God Amen there is an anchor in your life that brings about a a stability amen that keeps you but you are fickle there is nothing about you that is any better than any other human being amen except for the grace of God can you say Amen brother Brandon would say man in his nature is a Castaway he is an alien he's away from God then God by Grace has to draw him to his side and all that the father has given given me will come to me no way at all amen uh there ain't enough picture shows enough D Halls enough bersu shows in the in the country to keep you away from God Amen he says when God goes to drawing and back Yonder before the foundation of the world when he put your name down that you would come he says you're coming and that's all that's all amen so the only difference between you and between amen your neighbor down the road or between the amen is that God is calling you and God has got his grace upon you in in this time of turmoil that we can see and I want to say that in this time of turmoil amen we've got to keep our eyes upon the creator that created You In His Image because remember as I read the quote to you a couple weeks ago where brother bradam says listen to thus sayith the Lord if you consider me to be a prophet his servant just before the break of day or he says uh if you consider me to be a servant it's just before the break of day somebody look to your neighbor and tell them it's just before the break of day and that's why this horrible Gloom is over the Earth it's just before the coming of the Lord Jesus there's no more hope left in nothing but his coming nations are against Nations they have fooled with God's laboratory until they've got the power to blow uh one another into Atomic ashes they're Wicked they're unreligious they're un Christlike and the only motive they have an objective is to destroy you are inspired they they are inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men let me say this in the name of the Lord Jesus the holy spirit is sent as a Watchman on the Tower and the people cry what of the night are you weary of this life are you weary of sin are you weary of funeral processions and sickness and ungodliness on every hand has the night been long and weary what of the night Watchmen he said the morning cometh see the Comfort the morning cometh see the Comfort amen the angel of the Lord is with us he's going to lead aren't you glad that the angel of the Lord is leading us through all amen the Maze of of Darkness that we have found ourselves in and aren't you glad that the promise is still just as good today as the as it was when God said it amen no matter the rebellion and no matter the Wilderness experience no matter the all of the unbelief in the children of Israel there was still a promise and there was still an angel that was going to take them to that promise amen now the unbeliever couldn't make it but the unbeliever cannot keep the believer from believing sin cannot keep the UN amen The Believer from believing there is nothing that can keep you out of the promises of God because they are yes and amen they are not yes and no amen it's not if and maybe God has called you placed your name on his book and he said your name is written in that land can you say amen amen it's just as good God knew that this day was coming amen God said in in Luke 21 and 25 there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity and the Seas and the waves are roaring and men's heart failing for fear for for the looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with the power of great glory and when you see these things amen are are you hearing me have we seen amen signs in the heavens haven't we seen the signs in the in the moon and the signs and the scars haven't we been hearing this on the news for the last few years have we not seen the son of man's Cloud that he has returned back to amen now that's not the that's not the son of man that's not the body amen or it is the son of man but it's not the body of God but he came in the power of that cloud like he said he would come amen what was this here to do it was to let you know to lift up your head for Redemption draw as not when you see these things come to pass then look up lift up your heads for your Redemption is drawing nigh amen the angel of the Lord is still with you in the dark season the angel is still with you in your sickness the angel is still with you amen with all of the depression and and the sickness and and the discouragement and amen the the the uncertainty in the land he is still with you aren't you glad for that here this morning he is still with you amen Timothy the young Pastor amen was uh was under the pressure of his office and amen many not accepting his position due to his age and discouraging had said in and there he was in Ephesus and amen and and and a little bit discouraged but Timothy or the Apostle Paul wrote to him in in in 2 Timothy 1 and6 and he says I want you to put on Amen I I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God that is in thee amen I want you to go back and look at the one who called you I want you to go back and look at the one who has ordained you and he says for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and then he looks at him and he says don't you be ashamed of the testimony of Christ or of me his servant I don't want you to be ashamed of it because this is the power of God under salvation amen don't be ashamed of the Gospel don't be ashamed of your message don't be ashamed of your conversion don't be be ashamed of the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't be ashamed of the supernatural it is your vessel to a Rapture it is your promise it is what God sent to you in this last day to take you I say right now it would be good to just look around and say God you've been faithful to me amen you've healed my body you've strengthened you you've been good to my children you've been good to my husband you've been good to my wife God you've been faithful here unto me can you say amen I have seen God answer his word time and time and time and time again and I know there's Gloom I know the clouds can affect our desire and can affect amen the way we see things sometimes but why why would we allow the spirit of fear why would we allow anxiety Amen to perplex us when the angel of the Lord is leading the way amen the Angel didn't leave with brother bradam the angel is still here and he is still pointing us to the message that the seventh angel brought to us can you say Amen oh yes amen well amen many of times we look amen and we say oh if God doesn't do something really quick if we don't get an answer really quick if God doesn't let me tell you something God's going to meet you right in his t in he's going to meet you and bring you that Deliverance in Shalom brother bradam would say we are creatures of time and God he's God of Eternity and we try to press ourselves we try to press ourselves and make something different oh this has got to be done amen but remember he knows all about it and it's going to happen anyhow just let him do it just commit yourself unto to him amen want you turn to your neighbor and said don't press yourself just remember he's got it all in his hands it's going to happen let him do it and just commit yourself to it brother Wendell am I going to be okay I say yes you're going to be okay amen it seems dark brother wend amen my mind sometimes feels like it's just getting weary am I going to be okay I just need someone to tell me brother wend once again that I'm going to be okay I want to say the mighty angelist spoke to me this morning to tell you everything's going to be okay amen I don't know where you are I don't have to know where you are but he does know where you are and he is leading in the way sometimes he's leading through the Wilderness sometimes he leads you to the Red Sea sometimes he lead to the Giants but that's all right you're a giant killer as long as the a Ang's with you amen you're a sea opener as long as the angel is with you you can overcome anything as long as the angel of the Lord is with you and I say the angel of the Covenant is right there with you in your circumstance he's right there with you in your heartache uh he's right there with you and he's healing your body and he's bringing deliverance and he's showing his grace in your life Amen brother quit asking questions and take Courage the Angel of the Lord is with you here this morning hallelujah amen it seems so dark amen but is it not true that the darkness holds back the light is it not the darkness before the sunlight is the darkness there trying to hold back the light but the light will come forth because the light is stronger what is Darkness uh what is trouble uh they are just simply tools in the hand of God that is going to end up destroying the devil at the end I say take courage heal yeah praise the Lord some of you saying

going to have to hear the seven Angel's Voice come on church it's not what you hear out there on TV and it's not it's not what you hear doctor says or that one says you only way you're going to hear the mighty Angel is to hear the voice that he anointed but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound it will empower the church amen it'll tell it'll give you the authority it'll give you the power to raise above your troubles amen because though you're walking in the valley thou art with me Hallelujah can you say amen amen he says if thou will obey his voice

promise Giver was now coming he said brother Brandon would say what you see is the is just a portion of the rainbow he says but if you could see the whole rainbow as it goes all the way he is the beginning and he is the ending amen that is who God is can you say Amen so the one who gave the promise to the prophets of the Old Testament and gave the promise to the New Testament Church is the one who has come to Earth Amen to fulfill and complete his word in his church it's not a denomination it's not another preacher it is God himself the great Pillar of Fire I just want tell you amen if you

was a type of the holy spirit amen giving the power to the church to overcome it does not mean Heaven it does not mean that amen because he says a millennium there's not no fighting in the Millennium there's not no blood amen being spilled in the Millennium but he says but going into the promised land amen the angel of the Lord would anoint the children of Israel to take their Giants and to take their land and to kill every oh come on church but it was the angel of the Lord that would lead them and they came up amen and rooted these these these five Kings and these Kings went and hid amen

big Stone over the mouth of that cave and we'll deal with him later amen so they put a big old stone over the the mouth of the cave amen and they went out and the Bible says that they that they slew their enemy and they killed those old Devils oh come on Church they were anointed to do so but the Bible says that Joshua called the people amen and he says all right let's come back here to the mouth of this cave they took the amen the king's out and they laid him town and he called amen for for certain ones to come and to put their heads or their feet on their necks Hallelujah now now Joshua

ministry to call you out of the denominations that was the Moses Ministry with the two gifts but those two gifts did not take you into the promised land those two two gifts amen were out there in that world he went into the denominational World pulling out a people but the Joshua Ministry was 1963 when the mighty Angel anointed that book opened that book and gave you the sword to defeat the [Applause] Devil I didn't just come out of denominationalism Amen just to Into the Wilderness experience God called me out of denominationalism to go into the promised land and kill the giants that are possessing my land Hallelujah man you need a healing the angel of the Lord is with you you need Deliverance the angel of the Lord is with you come on Church we've become soft in this day we've

Christian radio and Christian this that or the other Amen in Ephesus you were going to have to stand alone but it was the Ephesian church was the church that was the perfect church it was the Ephesian Church standing alone upon the I'm here to tell you tonight you don't have to have a a a good youth group you don't have to have a big church you don't have to have everything handed to you all you need is an open book and to be ready to surrender your voice your body your being to the will of God in this evil and adulterous generation can I hear an [Applause] amen where the angel of the Lord is it's the anointing to defeat the enemy amen he says the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face and they shall come against thee one way and flee before these seven ways I'm talking to you here today can you say Amen you see the angel of the Lord someone say hallelujah hallelujah amen brother Brandon would say look up and shine with the joy of the Lord to know that you've been privileged that your eyes have come open and see this day oh I just want to I I feel really good about right now amen Rejoice Rejoice you're have come open amen he says then trust him for the future you've seen him vindicate his words in the past he that Vindicated his words in the days past and made all these other things happen just exactly to the hour that we're living in everything exactly to the seventh Angel's message both shown it in heaven and on Earth and made it known three ways so there there can't there can't be no slip up remember he promised he'd come again and he says hallelujah that word will be a Vindicated God's promised word with 2,000 years awaiting he will arrive on time don't be weary he'll be here as he has Vindicated his word in every age the church ages show the same thing and the revealing of Our Lord by the seventh message and so forth God revealed it God manifested it and proved it and in is among us today he showed himself here with us and proved and vend indicated his word and so will he somebody say so will he won't you won't you just turn to your neighbor because they didn't hear you the first time soul will he the one who Vindicated it the one who done it will do it again amen you say oh are you saying in the future I say we are the future Back to the Future here we are Hallelujah we are here amen the power of the holy spirit is upon a people today amen the only thing that is happening Amen in these last 60 years uh uh however long it's been since the prophet has been gone is for the church to come to the reality that that book is not just a a little uh amen a dress code book amen that this m message is not just a little formal Feelgood amen I belong to the message amen but it's taken it's taken all of this time for the church to realize that the same God that was on Elijah is on Elisha the same God that anointed him has anointed you why because you believe his words in my name you'll cast out devils in my name you'll speak in new tongues in my name you'll drink deadly things and not harm you in my name you'll Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover that's your promise am can you say amen amen in the midst of uncertainty he says shalom in the midst of tribulation when the winds are howling Shalom when nations are against Nations Shalom on Amen in the Shalom message he says there will be a millennium the old will be young there forever sickness will fade away and death will be no more and they shall build houses and they will inhabit them they'll plant Vineyards and eat the fruit thereof they'll not plant another inhabit his son take it his son will be living by him he'll not plant another eats and die off and somebody else take it but he'll live there amen the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw with like the bulock and a child shall EAD them around and there will be innocence there'll be nothing there be nothing could hurt we'll be changed from what we are now to that glorious image of the Son of God which is Immortal years can never touch him age can never do anything to him he's the immortal Son of God and we know that we're at the end time we're at the junction all these things fairly thoroughly identified and so will it be identified again when God said I want to send Elijah the prophet When God says that he would come with healing in his wings when he raised that Prophet up it was a Vindication to God's word it was the light on God's word it was God's word God God identifying himself and raising up that man and the prophet is saying as he has identified it there so will it be identified again the manifestation now I I you know it breaks all tops Elisha NE Elijah never did raise from the dead to come back and preach again that's i i i i if if you're looking for Elijah to return uh to to to raise from the dead you know I I I I just I you know he's going to raise in the general Resurrection like the rest of us amen but this worship of of brother brandom that he's got to rise up and finish his ministry I'm going to tell you something the seventh angel has completed the mystery of God you've got to believe what he said amen there ain't nothing future you've got to believe now it takes the elishah to pick up that mantle Keep Your Eyes Upon that word amen can you say amen amen the promises the promises then for an Elijah to come and to turn your hearts back and here we are we've turned our eyes back what are we looking at this morning if the scripture says he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and he said it over and over again turn it back to the fathers then what are we to be looking at in this dark day before the Rapture of the church we are to keep our eyes upon the fathers we're to keep our eyes on the word of God and he that's promised the Millennium is going to fulfill it just like he raised up a prophet there is a bride here on the earth that is fixing to see a Rapture just as he promised that there would be no sickness and there would be no pain and there would be no more heart trouble and there would be no more Hallelujah the mighty Angel is here he's taking you to that promise and he's fulfilling that promise right now as we speak can you say amen hallelujah what am I going to do as the old song we used to sing until then my heart will go on singing remember that one sister Leah until then with joy I'll carry on until the day huh mine eyes behold that city until the day God calls me home can you say amen he says now the future he holds it how do I know when he's coming when is he coming I don't know but he'll be here that's right he will do thus and thus when will the curse go off the earth when were these blessed reflections of God's love and the trees standing here and Shining out and the Flowers and Things amen with with with will they grow mortal grow I don't know but they will when will all of the reflections of men's Hearts desires to live and hospitals and doctors and operations and crying and grief we will it all cease to a glorious Wayne with Jesus of a thousand years of Shalom when will it I don't know but he said it would be there I don't know how he's going to do it I don't know but his but but his spoken word will be Vindicated when the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings and the healing part will not be a physical healing as you think amen as saying somebody got a sickness and it'll be taken away from him but that's what he's doing now in type but the whole creature will be changed with this Mortal shall take on immortality and this old BL will jump into youth amen how will it be I don't know but it will be there there's a hope are you hearing me there's there there's a hope there's something laying within us the angel of the Lord is is leading us it's leading us he's done told us that there would be the three women Amen in the Book of Revelations there would be the great amen and and there would be the harlots but there would also be the the bride yes it's happened yes he's foreseeing the Destroyer he said the man of sin is going to be revealed amen I believe it's happening believe it's happening someone said the other day that am man Trump went to visit with with the Pope amen I don't know what what what is he thinking as far as fixing our e economy is he going to make a deal with Rome will he get into the office so that he can do that being a deal maker I don't know he knows are we that close to making a deal I don't know but until then I'm not looking at this one or that one I'm looking at a Divine promise I'm holding a book and I'm fighting those Devils off that will keep me from the eternal life can you see am man do you love him aren't you glad we have a message to secur us well glory to God Amen I'm so glad now brother brandham would say Jacob as a Wanderer yet in the promise he said he ran for his life well he would have he says he wouldn't have got killed anyhow for God was with him then one day after tired and running through the Wilderness looking back to see if Esau was coming and you know and scared and nervous and wondered if he could hear the gallop the horse hoof somewhere Esau Jacob probably with his little spear to keep the animals off of him run as hard as he could and his little old ragged coat kept tearing through the Wilderness and climbed up on a big old high hill so he could look way off and see if he had seen Esau coming anywhere in the evening sun going down the poor little fell was tired and he just rode some rocks together and laid down for a rest I just want to tell you sometimes it's good to just go find us a little place and rest now stick with me a little bit longer I'm not going to hold you too much too much more time but he he he he he run and he was running and he was running for his life and then he laid down and he said he rode some Stones together and laid them for a a rest and he fell into a trance and it was God talking to a servant because in his servant not because he was right but because God had made a promise amen look the way Jacob got it but God had a promise and had to keep it in the loins of Jacob laid the blessings and the rest and the righteous seed coming forth from there according to the seed of Isaac his father which had been promised through Abraham and in L in Jacob's loins was the seed laying there whether it come out many centuries Generations on but there was the promise God took Jacob and showed him some of the future and know he was an heir of the promise not because he deserved it someone say hallelujah hallelujah but because God had promised it not because you got a right not because that's something you've done but because God gave you the same kind of promise when we are dead in Christ and take on Abraham's seed are we are heirs with Abraham in the promise now the only way you can be an heir is to be dead to yourself take on the Seed of Abraham which was Christ and Christ can only come by the Holy Ghost that's right then you're an heir of the same promise Pilgrim listen at it a pilgrim stranger seeking a city to come who Builder and maker so Journey wandering about there you are Pilgrim but a faith that looks steadfast Through The Dark Skies the Cloudy weather and he's beyond that God and God in his great domain Dominion above little old Steven was dying and Jesus had been glorified sitting up there up there at the right hand of the majesty and they began to beat him with stones and his head was mashed in with the stones and Steven looked steadfast toward the heavens Jesus after he had finished his work had sat down on the right hand but Stephen when he saw Heavens open up Jesus was standing at the right hand of God I guess the Savior must have stood stood up from his throne and gave the Martyr a welcome in yes he saw the Everlasting Dominion of God above God's promis is true look at him now we we take Jacob and he lays down God shuts him off gives him a coma of a vision and he looks up and he sees a ladder fastened up in heaven to God's throne and reached all the way to the Earth and Angels ascending and descending on the ladder up and down all through the years we found out that this was a beautiful promise that God had promised a way of escape a ladder to climb on a sure Foundation God had promised it God was hooked but it was hooked into glory and to the throne of God but where could he find a place on Earth to hook it Hallelujah he can't hook it to you he can't hook it to me he said he he tried to hook it one time to the newest Jewish Nation he found out they couldn't do it he knew he was going to have to do all the time because he had promised the seed and the seed was in Jacob then but he couldn't hook it on Jacob that's a planter neither could he hook it to Abraham the little fella sitting out there backslid little Shyer lying treating his wife the way he was he couldn't hook it onto that he couldn't hook it on many other things he couldn't hook it into the temple Jesus said there'll be a time where there won't be one stone left on another he tried on the patriarch David he took bisha for a wife you're right had him killed see everything he tried to hook it to it wouldn't anchor but he says oh Hallelujah but the prophet said there will be a stone laid in Zion a precious stone a tried Stone and that'll be the anchor someone shout yes a wonderful Stone than God being God in heaven with the ladder hooked into his own Throne he hooked it also in none other but the son of man Jesus Christ the Chief Cornerstone God won't let this ladder slipping around amen he tried to hook it to a covenant with Adam he broke it he hooked with a covenant but he broke broke it amen God made the Covenant unconditionally he hooked it into Jesus Christ there it's anchored there's no slipping there's no sliding there's no getting away what is it it is hooked by God above and by the Son of God beneath he's talking about you I don't care what you're feeling where you're at and what the devil tries to tell you amen that you're just all messed up I want you to know what never was for you it's hooked into God's predestinated plan and Jesus the blood of Jesus here down below amen the reason why we don't fight battles is our kill our Devils is because they're over there lying to us and they've talked the sword out of our hands amen praise the Lord he says you Can't Fail it's a pathway it's a traveler's way from Earth to glory and you can't fail look there's great companies of angels up and down ascending and descending picking up the weary and the sick healing their bodies showing visions and mighty signs and wonders Can't Fail can't slip can't slide you're safe God said so that settles it forever it's hooked around the heart of God of Heaven hooked around the Son of God down here here and we're brought into it through the Son of God and we Ascend unto him well that should make you want to start dancing like a Pentecostal Hallelujah he says oh my amen then what are you scared about our promise is hooked between God and Christ and we're in between them with the angels he said he'll give his angels charge over Thee the angels of God are encamped around those that fear Him and all up and down when we're making this Foundation climbing each day higher and higher each day brings me around High closer amen uh higher as I move up up up up anything happens if I fall along the road or something happens to me there's a great host of Angels standing there to pick me up come on we're marching on upward to Zion Oh into that beautiful city above Can't Fail there's no failing in it don't rest upon what I what I do it rest upon what he did am am man it's already finished the believer once anchored in Christ Jesus coming through the door back there put on the highway you can't get any way but straight up to God with it Angels take care of you God made a way of this and when he seen it in the beginning in our first parents fall and he seen the Covenant he made with Adam he tried to make the an anchor into him and it failed then there's nothing else he could hook it to but to bring down his own son and hook it to him and now it can't fail so what are we worried about what are we stewing about what are we going along longf faced about let's look up and grin look up and not only grin but laugh not only laugh but raise up holy hands everywhere and give praise and glory to God for his promises his yay and amen not yes and no not yes and no but yes there's no no in it Hallelujah there's no no I look I like his English there's no no in it our foundation stands sure somebody say our foundation stand sure Foundation of God God laid in Zion the Cornerstone there we are we can't slip we can't slide can't move then we come into the door through Christ put on here and we may have our ups and downs along that's true enough sicknesses and troubles but remember there's a great company of angels all along the road to Bear thee up anytime taking you up when you fall oh yes he's there he's promised it he made the way of it can you say Amen this morning as we come to a close the word is for sure the angel of God is just as powerful as it's ever been no matter where you are from the time that you gave your life to God to the time that you reach heaven hallelujah it's already been taken care of as I told you before we are not in Wilderness we're not in Egypt we're not in the wilderness we are in the promised land we're taking possession of what God seen in his mind for us now brothers sisters you can't be wishy-washy with God you can't serve God and then keep your own way you're going to have to surrender everything you've got if you want Victory what I have found is we had in Pentecost we had we didn't have all of the word so how could there be full justification we could shout and rejoice we had great manifestations we seen God do wonderful things but God wasn't Lord of us so when the Miracles were done the healings were done prophecies were given they were just finished we would have our highs and go down to our real deep lows because we were living from emotion to emotion but when we made him Lord we weren't depending on the preacher weren't depending on gifts weren't depending on emotions didn't matter whether we were walking in the Valley of the shadow of death we feared no evil why because the word has come to Anchor us I must surrender everything I am to his word can you say amen amen where where are you where are you at today are you in a battle are you wondering if you're going to make it I say today you're going to make it I say you're going to make it because he's made it I say you're going to make it because the mighty Angel has comeing this day the great holy spirit is here the very person of the word is here to meet you in your at your point of need can you say amen hallelujah he's aware this morning if the musicians would come he's aware of every sickness he's aware of every circumstance he's aware of every situation in your job in your marriage your home he's aware of your children he's aware he knows where you are he knows right where you are [Music] I'm a guy that believes that the message that God brought us through the seventh Church age messenger is very viable very real very up toate even for today that no matter what you're going through I believe that we can find the [Music] answer some say wow brother things have changed a lot since the since the prophet has left the Earth indeed so indeed so but go back and listen to brother brandham in these last especially those last three four years of his ministry and if he didn't tell us that we would be right here in this condition today if that wasn't a prophetic utterance these those last three years telling us of what this world would look look like [Music] today he said America would become totally [Music] Lawless Lawless brother Lawless he said before the coming of the Lord the entire world would go insane [Music] H are we not there that that's that's that's up to date [Music] friend and that kcki and with only a seventh grade education couldn't have came up with that all by himself [Music] it was the mighty [Music] Angel speaking words into his Spirit to empower me and you in this day that we're living in and that Mighty Angel is here the same one that anointed him to speak is the same one that's anointing you to hear to receive and to cause those Spirit spoken words to conceive in our [Music] hearts all I have to do is quit resisting all I have to do is quit trying to figure it out all I have to do is just say I believe it I believe it I don't know how I don't know when I don't [Music] know the circumstances are Bleak the trials are Bleak the darkness is all around [Music] me I wouldn't be able to tell anybody how I'm going to get through it but I know I'm going to get through it because I'm hiding his word in my heart I'm hiding his word I'm loving his word I'm giving myself to [Music] him and I know I know his Angel is going before me to defeat my enemies I know his Angel is with me to overcome every stronghold of the enemy I don't know how you they don't teach this in school you can't get a degree in college for it all I know is I trust him all I know is I trust him with all of my heart and I'm following his word and I'm giving myself to him consecrating everything that I am my thoughts my spirit consecrating everything I am to him and I know he's working his word in me can you say [Music] Amen the seat can't say how it's going to happen and neither can the dirt that is surrounding the seat tell how it's going to happen the Magic's in the seed and all I know is the words of life that I've that has imp parted into my spirit and my soul I don't know [Music] how but I do believe that that new body is being shaped around those words that I'm believing I believe Victory is being shaped around those words that I'm believing do you have that same hope here this morning it's who I am and I'm believe in the Lord for [Music] it so I stand here
