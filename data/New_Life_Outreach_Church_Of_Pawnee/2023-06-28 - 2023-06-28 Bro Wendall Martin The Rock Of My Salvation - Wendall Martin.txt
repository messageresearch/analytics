chapter and um amen we're going to um instead of I want to I'm going to pull off my subject that we have been doing for the um yeah um the mysterious one walking in the midst of the candlesticks and I'd like to just speak on Revelation for tonight and um and and it's important that that that we in anything that we take we don't we don't want to receive any of the word just with words but we want revelation to really strike our hearts as to what we're doing because amen we can put pencil to paper but that doesn't always that doesn't two plus two doesn't always equal four with God and so we want we always want divine revelation amen and so this is going to be a simple uh uh a text here tonight but I want us to look here at Psalm 62 and 1. and um it says truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved how long will he imagine Mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be as a tottering fence they only consultant to cast him down from his Excellency they Delight in lies they bless with their mouth they curse inwardly it's Allah my soul wait thou upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved and God is my salvation my glory the rock of my strength my refuge is in God trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Salah can you say Amen to the word let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you tonight for your love and the many blessings that you have given us tonight and I I just ask Lord that your Holy Spirit would continue to be here as Sister Mary was singing that song and how it it rings in every one of our hearts amen you're our shelter you're our strength you're our Rock and father I'm asking oh Rock of Revelation that you would hide us all within within you oh let that Rock of Ages hide every one of God's redeemed we ask God that you would just be with us here tonight help my mind and my heart Lord I ask Lord that you would help my ears to hear from you my tongues only speak what you would say we love you father in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen we we are glad to be back home uh we I you know I actually um had one of the most uh incredible uh uh Journeys amen and um as far as flying amen I tell you what I could have almost wrote a book on flying just just on this trip right here and so with all the flights canceled and and this that and the other and just trying to get to Saskatoon and um uh you know they they canceled my flight on Thursday and so then we can get everything all worked out for Friday morning and I went over over with him I called couple times make sure we're all ready to go and then we get there and get up to uh Denver and uh when when where the itinerary says I'm supposed to go they don't know they don't have my name they ain't got a seat they don't have nothing for me and um Jesse and I ran all day long Friday we're talking about running from one end of the airport to the other uh maybe a couple times amen and uh and so we we were we it was it was quite it was quite the deal and um to get there and and of course when we got there we didn't have our luggage and so I was glad that I wore a suit going up there because I got there Friday night just in time to walk up to the pulpit and preach and um and so uh someone loaned me a tie and some hairspray so that my hair would look a little better and and so I get up there and then um we're back at the airport until 1 30 that night trying to find my luggage and um and so and I was wet I I preached that night the Lord really blessed and so I was wet from head to toe so my wife had to go wash my clothes uh so that I would have something to wear on Friday or on Saturday and it was quite the deal and so coming back uh Hallelujah the same old same old so we got back home here this uh in Pawnee last night at around 2 30 or this morning around 2 30 without our luggage amen and so uh but amen we've got our luggage now we did we did finally get the luggage this afternoon and so uh just got back in um just 4 30 or so so um it was quite a deal hey man quite the deal but we're glad for what God done for for them and the blessings amen and um and so uh uh a brother uh actually his brother Kelly Hildebrandt amen um heard that we didn't have an organ and he told me he says uh go find you in Oregon I'm going to buy you an organ amen so the Lord's going to bless us with an organ amen and um so you know we're we're thankful we're just thankful for the Lord for that we had a wonderful time and they sent their greetings back here to the church and um uh we just appreciate all of you guys uh we heard uh I I'd seen there where my brother Joe had had told me about about his deal with his with his lungs and and I want to tell you brother Joe we are not going to accept any rattlesnakes from the Devil we're not going to accept anything the devil has to offer and um many are the afflictions of the righteous and that's that's that's a promise that is just as much Bible as as God so loved the world Amen many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them out of them all that's also the Bible amen and so uh we we trust in the Lord for that can you say man and so we've got this rock of my salvation amen this rock of Revelation and so I want to to speak because in this hour it's an incredibly uh Dark Age it's a it's a dark it's a dark time so many questions and and and so many attitudes and and so many interpretations to scripture there's there are so many uh things to keep your emotions running wild there are so many things to keep your mind uh uh looking amen from this and this and this but I want to tell you there is a rock of Revelation that we must build upon amen it's a it's a it's the rock of divine revelation and so as we as we look we as Believers amen it is our duty it is our duty to make sure that we are building upon the right things we cannot build according to our mental Powers we cannot build in our Christian walk or our amen anything about us except we look and build according to the word of God and the word of God is the only thing that is eternal amen now you can't build according to my opinion you can't build according to any other man's opinion we build according to the word of the law now this is what we're preparing for we're preparing for Eternal amen eternity we are preparing for eternal life and God in this in this world that we're living amen that is that that we can we can get so caught up with a man uh with with with all of the Fantastics of the world but everything of this world will fail it will come to not amen every man will come tonight only God's Divine word will endure forever amen that's right there is there is nothing nothing that is more important than God to reveal his word to us when we say reveal we're saying God what you have had in your mind amen your desires I'm asking that you would drop them down into my heart that's the reason why the psalmist amen says there in Psalms 1 21 and 1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from which cometh my help my help comes from the Lord amen he will not suffer thy foot to be moved and he that keepeth thee will not Slumber can you say amen that's comforting brother Joe is when the enemy's coming in he that keeps me will never Slumber it's it's wonderful to know that he that saved me will complete that which he has started in my life now this Earthly journey is going to be an incredible journey of a of faith it is safe amen it's uh it's a it's it's it's it's not you don't know what tomorrow holds you don't know what next week coach we don't know what's going to happen amen we don't know who's going to be elected as the president but you see God's given us in this dark hour that we're living in he's given us divine revelation again he's taking a piece of himself dropping it in our heart to give us the same settledness that he has God doesn't worry and neither should you God doesn't have to guess and neither should you God knows everything is going to be okay and so should you man he only is my rock he only is my salvation he only is my strength he only is my refuge he only is my defense he only he only he is my rapture he is my understanding can you say man so when we say God is my revelation we are saying amen that he that when we say that he is my rock we are saying he is my Revelation amen Jesus Christ is the revelation of God I want to say this the bride who can take that word in their hearts becomes the revelation of God the bride becomes the revelation of God for the day that they're living in because the mind of God has been manifested unto them praise the Lord Revelation when Jesus asked his disciples who do men say that I am and some say well you're this and some say you're that some say you're this well I heard someone say this and that and amen but when he asked them who do you say that I am and I think that's important for every one of us every one of us have got to come to the amen have got to come face to face with reality what is my opinion I say that I'm a Believer I say that I'm a Christian I say I want God I say I want a deeper Revelation but when God comes himself to manifest are we willing to allow God to reveal himself to us praise the Lord amen now you can't have faith in what your mama's thought or what you think is right you've got to have faith in what God's revelation is for the day are you with me because your faith is going to be tried amen your faith is going to be tried will it be on a solid rock will your Revelation endure the testing that will come Amen brother your test your faith is going to be tested and I just want to ask when your faith is being put to the test will you remain standing oh come on now amen it's a little bit different story when the doctor is telling you you're going to die it's a little bit different story what it is your child that is backslip it's a little bit different story amen when you your best friend walks away from the message will you still be standing when the trusting of your revelation can you say Amen because we want faith we want a revelation that is just as strong as Gladius amen Peter stands up and he says I Know Who You Are you're the Christ you're the Messiah you're the anointed one and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood is not revealed this unto you amen but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock what was that rock the revelation of the father I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it so your Revelation becomes your anchor amen Revelation now it becomes your anchor now we can put things on the board here and we can sort of and and we can take some of the revelations that brother Branham has brought but until we can see ourselves ourselves on that board we'll praise the Lord until we can see ourselves in the candlesticks until we can see out today because I want to tell you everything in the Book of Revelations amen is simply unveiling Who You Are man oh his word anchors me can you say Amen Hallelujah someone that can stand up and say I know who I am someone who can stand up and say I know the season that I'm living in someone that can stand up and say the world is preparing for tribulation but God is preparing me for my eternal home someone that can stand up who I am nothing can stop it it's already been spoken the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God can you say Amen no wonder he could say they're in Psalm 62 and 2 or 8 trust in him at all times pour out your heart before him God has a refuge for us many say pray for me to be healed brother Wendell amen many times instead I think people should be praying saying Teach me the word so that I can cooperate with God pray for my children to be saved brother Wendell I think many times someone needs to say teach me the word so that I can cooperate with God well praise the Lord healing you ought for healing it's already yours you've got to find out how to get it you don't have to death amen or find are you asking beg for victory it's already yours but you've got to cooperate with God to do what it takes to get it well praise the Lord so the Revelation is the illumination amen it is the will of God made known it is the light that lights every believer's pathway now can there be light in darkness when there's Darkness all around and I say that's where the Paradox Lays because the promise was in the Twilight time is when the light shall be his Noonday that's what the Bible said in the Twilight time is when your light shall be as the Noonday it's in the gross darkness that the Bible says the paths of the just will be growing brighter and brighter how do I know that I'm growing brighter and brighter is because his word is becoming more real and more real and more real it's not in learning it's in trusting it's not in learning it's an understanding it's a revelation of who you are they're in proverbs 4 and 18. it says but the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shineth more and more unto the perfect way Day and The Way of the Wicked is as darkness and they know not at what they stumble so while The Stumbling is going on here's the elect Walking with God in divine revelation Hallelujah hallelujah it's no wonder Isaiah 60 and 1. what does it say arise Shine for thy Revelation has come because the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee and then the next verse the whole Darkness Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee what can you say Amen so your deed your position depends on your revelation praise the Lord it's just as simple as that my position depends on the understanding that God has given to me that's why we want to pray Lord give me divine revelation I think it takes prayer I I think I I think I think every one of us should be very prayerful saying God I want you to reveal yourself to me that doesn't mean you're going to be become a mathematician or that you're going to become a scholar or that you're going to be able to quote the scriptures but it does let you know one thing here there's a settled heart in knowing that you are the scripture for this day there's a subtle heart it's not that you can quote everything it's not that you you even understand the all the seals or that you understand all of those things are those things are simply there to let you know who you are and you've got to rest with absolute assurance because it's that Revelation that is going to pull us out of this world can you say man that's the reason why the Apostle Paul says in Ephesians 1 and 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding be an enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power oh God this Revelation is not a revelation of I'm just going to barely get by this Revelation is a revelation that God Lives in You oh he says what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also on that is to come and hath put all things under his foot feed and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body well praise the Lord the fullness of him that dwelleth all in all now so our revelation that the Revelation is the is the secret pass Iman it's for the only those that belong there Revelation isn't given to the world it's only given to those who are ordained to go there now I I want us to turn to Mark the fourth chapter and and uh I'm I'm I'll I'll wait until we all get there because I want the kids to know this one and this this is a a wonderful thing mark the fourth chapter and we're going to read start at the first verse praise the Lord do you love him amen it says he began to teach by the seaside and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and set in a sea in the whole uh multitude was by the Sea and the land and he taught them many things but parables he said unto him in his Doctrine hearken behold there went out a soul were to sow and it came to pass as he sold some fell upon the Wayside and the fowls of the air come and divide it up some fell on Stony ground where it had much Earth and immediately it sprung up because uh and because it had no depth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away some fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 some 60 some 100. and he said unto them he that has ears to hear Let Him hear and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked him of the parable and he said unto them unto you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables sing then they may see and not perceive hearing they may hear and not understand let's let any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them now he is speaking in parables Hallelujah now as they left didn't understand the parable neither but he knew the elect would come and say teach us teach us the parable teach us the parable now everyone's heard what you said but the 12 is saying we want to understand what this means well glory to God you see now watch he says unto you is given to know the Mysteries but unto them it is done in parables amen saying they see they don't perceive now then he began to explain what was taking place and he and he says the 13th verse and he said unto them no ye not this Parable how then shall you know all Parables the sower so with the word and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown and when they have heard Satan immediately cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts and these are likewise which are on Stony ground who when they heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake immediately they are offended and these are they that are sown among the Thorns such as hear the word the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and lusts of other things entering in chokes the word and it becomes unfruitful these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word receive the word and bring forth fruit there's where God's looking for every one of them heard but only one had revelation well glory to God now I I I don't want to just be hearers the scripture says you can be hearers forgetful hearers we don't want to be forgetful hearers we want the Revelation to come because it's the Revelation that goes down deep well praise the Lord amen now look at that the Wayside the Wayside a ground amen the word is sown it's sown but when they hear it Satan comes in immediately Hallelujah this happens right in the church service preachers are preaching and because we are so caught up of this world and we're so caught up well praise the Lord amen and it just immediately jokes out we've not spent any time seeking Revelation we've not spent any time calling out we've not separated ourselves and and but the Wayside the word is preached in there it writes to them just like the one with the good ground man and when they hear it immediately are y'all hearing me Satan comes in and say well I got to work tomorrow well I got to do this well I've got to do that instead of preparing your ground for the word to come instead of covering that word over in your heart well glory to God I I listen folks amen I don't want to sit in a church hearing service after service after service and not have any revelation oh my oh my just punching my time clock in punching my time clock in well can you say amen amen God's not interested in you punching your time clock in God wants that word to take root in your heart amen now he's not telling that out there to the world because the Revelation is given to the elect the Revelation the understanding to these scriptures are given to the elect now it's up to the elect someone say I'm elect you can be elect and still have Stony ground we've got to prepare our minds and our hearts well praise the Lord now Jesus wouldn't be telling them amen but now and then and then you've got and then you've got those a man that you know they they they hear the words that's Stony Crown they hear the word all the word is so rich and the word is so good and we are so blessed oh brother Wendell oh you're a good preacher and then as soon as the trial hits right all hits the purse execution comes and the Bible just told us for the word's sake the trial is coming because you have embraced the way the word and because there's no root man we've been offended and and then before you know it amen well are you hearing me it only endures for a Time but now watch that now now catching with that Stony Crown that's 16th verse it says immediately receive it with gladness have no root in themselves so endure but for a time and afterward when Affliction or persecution arrived for the word's sake immediately they are offended but there's an elect that is saying I don't want the cares of this world I don't want anything taking it away from me let this word have its root half let me stand upon That Rock of Ages well praise the Lord Jesus there in Luke 10 and 21. it says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes the elect oh hallelujah oh how our hearts how how our heart should be soft Lord don't let these Mysteries don't let these Mysteries just fall on this but let it fall right here is that right amen because because everyone's reading the book but I want to have the Revelation for myself now watch this watch this it says and as revealed under the base even so father I love this for so it seemed good in thy sight things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is baptistan and he to whom the son will reveal him or when he's revealing when that word's coming forth when that are y'all are y'all catching my drift here when that word is coming forth what kind of a grant now he's he's not reading he says I'm I'm putting it in Parables out there for them but I'm revealing it unto you but now you've got to make sure that while he's revealing it what kind of a ground it's going to be resting on Hallelujah I thank God I I think that there should be a real dedication around the time of church services and about the time that we're going into our Bible study and our devotions is Lord open your heart up to me when I'm listening to those messages when I'm when I'm reading the Bible when I'm when I'm coming and setting in the church services Lord let my well praise the Lord amen when it gets to the point to where we're just barely sliding in in time for church to start amen it it shows that a mountain that that that that that that the preparation that the prophet taught us how to come in early and and to settle things and quieten our spirits and be prepared for the word to come we're fine that there's other things that begin to come in and crowd it out before you know it you're gonna you're you're it's crowding out your Victory it's crowding out the very thing that God's intended for you it's the revelation of God that empowers you to overcome the enemy God revealing himself to you can you say amen and again God is not the words on a book God is that Living Word he's the logos God is that pulsating word not words here yeah you can take every word that is in this book and write another book with those words right but he's the Living Word he's the pulsating word he's the word that knows every thought he's the word that knows every he knows your tomorrows he's the word that he's the word that spoke the world into existence he's the word that is revealing himself to you I love it I love it amen John 14 and 16. amen then it says and I will pray the father and he will shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not in other words there's no revelation neither unders knoweth or understand of him but you know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you brother Branham was asked the question what is the evidence this is in 64. what is the evidence that a person is really filled with the Holy Ghost he says John 14 26 when the Holy Ghost has come he will show you things to come he'll perfect it somebody say he'll perfect it man-maids won't do it but he is the word when he's the Holy Ghost has come he will identify himself in you with the scripture that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word can I hear a great big he will I get the scripture Lord don't let me don't let me just read the Bible and see something of the past let me read the Bible and say ah oh this is happening all around me oh I'm part of a big plan yeah yeah now let me read the Bible as just a history book no The Living Word is making the pages the words on the pages come off the pages and live in you then when you wake up in the morning time you know that you are the one that God's put here on this Earth and you can turn around and say search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they testify of me why because the logos that revealed to Jesus who he was is the same logos that's revealing to you who you are it'll never happen as long as it's words on a page as long as it's something on a chalkboard it's got to be the reality within your heart can you see man now can you imagine worshiping without a revelation going through the motions without understanding what God is doing brother random talking about their own the men on the road to Emmaus they were walking without divine revelation yet they were the elect of God he says they don't even realize that they're the ones as fulfilling scripture amen now no he's this one here is not talking about them this is talking about the Pharisees I'm sorry that's fulfilling the scripture and people don't realize that that doing these things and saying these things are fulfilling scripture how little did Caiaphas the high priest and those priests in that day that scoffed and made fun of him they didn't know that the very God that they were singing about my God why is Thou forsaken me the 22nd song my hands and my feet they've pierced singing that in the temple and him dying up there on the cross little did they know they were doing it they're the scripture was right the present tense but because they'd learned it here and they weren't seeking for Revelation here they messed mess oh Jesus can you say Amen he says even Jesus prayed father forgive them for they know not what they are doing can you say Amen now but it's not that way you teenagers you you kids mamas and daddies it's totally different for this bride it says brother Branham and the Rapture says there you go there you are back to that blindness again trampling over the things of God as if it didn't mean nothing scoffing and making fun of it that's what the Bible said but to the church to the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that Revelation the True Blood of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture what is it brother Brandon says when she recognizes who she is then the Rapture will take place he says searched the scriptures identified himself and then he told all the rest of them look at the scripture baby I'm the living proof I'm the I'm booked about and the church should have that kind of a revelation today this should be such a a a a a a rock bed you've built your house on you built your emotions on you built your thinking on you built your belief system on this revelation of this hour is God Christ in you the hope of glory amen can you say man then there's nothing that can take you out brother madam says when a man once catches the vision of the invisible God and knows that he's always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around about him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by a promise he's lacking glory to God nothing could stop Moses after the revelation praise the Lord nothing why because God showed him the purpose God showed him the time after that burning bush there was nothing going to turn him around [Laughter] his emotions couldn't play with him anymore and there wasn't no egyptian going to run him out of Egypt anymore he was the man he had a purpose and he knew it was God's time and brother brother Branham says when Moses found out now the real direct will of God and the time of God and the revelation of everything to do now try to keep him out of Egypt right back to Egypt he went just as hard as he could go for he knew that God had promised Deliverance and the time had come for deliverance [Laughter] now did it mean the obstacles were in the way did it mean that everyone all of the elect of Israel those that have been ordained to come out in Egypt were going to understand no no no no no no no no they all turned on him are causing our troubles leave us alone but Moses said I'm God's deliverer and you're coming out Hallelujah Hallelujah something about a mom and a Daddy who know who they are no matter what what the children are going through no matter what the situation is God has ordained us for such a time as this something about a hey man a good leader when everything's going crazy and everything's upside down he just keeps he just keeps his Compass toward the North he keeps right on a walking says I know it won't let us down can you say Amen hallelujah oh do you love him man oh how we need it this is the reason I say I thought we would just speak on this here tonight and I know it's just simple but I want I want I want not just learning amen oh when you can see yourself in those seals when you can see yourself in those Church ages when you can see when you can see that this mysterious one walking in the candlesticks is Christ in you when you can see that that is word and this word is simply to open up this word to you [Music] when you see this promise this word says that is me preacher can't make you do that a preacher can't give you a revelation a preacher can't make you anything you are the product of him someone told me here the other day said well brother Wendell I'm just so stupid amen right man listen to some of the these Wednesday nights and I've just felt like I should know a lot more than what I know and I just it wasn't you amen praise the Lord although I was just talking about candlesticks and Austin says I'm lost just joking God's Not Call he might not have called you to be a preacher he might not have called you to be able to to see things but there's one thing about it what you do here and what you do see you know it's for you and it stabilizes you now you might not be able to turn around and tell people what the stars are or what the you know what what the horns represent or what this one represents what the eyes are uh you know the seven eyes represents and and all of those things and we're thankful for that and that's reason why we're going through it is so you can see that it's the supernatural God to a natural Church it's the supernatural God marrying Humanity just as two thousand years ago it was the supernatural invisible God living in a body in a man now it's the great invisible God the Hallelujah what's the seven eyes because there's going to be Seven Ages what's the seven horns because amen that's the Lamb's protection is that right seven eyes is Prophet God the seers whose seven Church ages what is it it is God himself in a body not the Redeemer body of Jesus but the redeemed body of Jesus Christ living in you when you make mistakes you know that there's a bloody lamb oh can you say Amen I'm glad I'm glad that an angel did not bring the book and open the seals I'm glad it was the lamb because while he's handing you the book He's Still the Lamb he's still bleeding he is still well praise the Lord and that blood will be just as powerful until the very last of God's elect sees their names in that book men have tried to come in and say huh there ain't no more blood left he's left the throne the intercession now he's got the book no one can be saved after 65 then they said no one can be saved after 77. no one can be saved and I want to say here tonight that the Lamb's blood is still for you can you say Amen it's that revelation it's that re you see there's the three revealings there's the three revealings it's in the symbol form then it brought from a prophet in the revealing form to let you see what everything is then there's the actuality where the lamb comes and claims you in a rapture that's why brother Branham taught us you've got to hear that cry first because or that shout it's that shout that is letting you know what the book is saying and when you see it by divine revelation you stand up and prepare yourself you hear the Midnight Cry say the bridegroom cometh he's coming announced it to you not my brother not my mama but it's me O Lord can you say Amen y'all catch that it's revelation to me and brother Branham in there revelation of Jesus Christ he says no man knows the things of God Save The Spirit of man and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 and 21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Christ Jesus Jesus Christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say that he becomes sinful but he became sin for us that by our Union with him we might become the righteousness of God now if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children it's just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive somebody say alive to us and that will take revelation do you understand what he's saying is that beautiful come sin for you then you've also got to accept the fact that you become the righteousness of God I guarantee you if you really understand that you're the righteousness of God you you you're going to do some high stepping can you see man there ain't no beat down there ain't no well what if well maybe I no sir Revelation has told me who I am and I'm standing on the Rock of Ages I don't care hell or high waters come I'm standing I'm secure I'm anchored I've anchored my soul in that precious Rock of Ages can you say Amen amen yes sir now as we close brother random says every seed must come after his kind God made Man In His Image after his kind to be his word on the Earth he expressed it in Christ Jesus Christ what was God was in Christ that's a man after his kind when God which is the word how many knows he's the word when the word was in Christ amen a human man expressing itself through him that was God the word in Christ expressing itself you want to know why that I've been as we've been dealing with these this mysterious one and I keep saying that it was a man and I've really been talking about how it was a man that God created to redeem because he come to create or to redeem men and women he says and God in the beginning made man in his own image that's the kind of man that God makes today the Seminary the incubator Hatchery turns out a bunch of hybrids the schools but when God calls a man he's his own image the word Made Alive in him that's right there he is that's God's man man in God's Own image is his very likeness Jesus said he'll do the works that I do so God made man in his own image after his kind his kind what is his kind the word he is the word then if any man denies God's word how can he be in God's image just ask the question ask yourself how can you be in God's image and deny God's word when the word is expressed image of himself oh he says it doesn't it doesn't mean that the express image of God will say oh I said it but I oh yeah he's he's saying the express image of God would say oh I said it but I don't really mean it I was wrong there I back up that was for some other time I didn't mean it oh mercy trash slump of the devil that's what he fed Eve don't let him try to poke it down the elected neck no sir they won't believe that just come join with our gang join nothing you've got to be born not joined a new creature in his own image of his kind to be his word expressed here on the Earth now Jesus was God's expressed word do you believe that do you believe it then what are we to be sons of God too with the expressed word in the church carrying on is it Lutheran kind after the Luther Methodist kind after the Methodist Catholic kind Catholic Catholic Pentecostal kind after it's kind the Oneness kind the Trinity after it's but if you're God's kind that is different you see that you're the expressed image of the word making itself manifest oh my why it's got to if the water falls on it it's got to then you then give him a birth God made him after his very own image well give me that kind of a revelation I don't want it here I want it here this here Puffs you up this here oh it gives you eyesight wait a minute amen Hallelujah I'm here for a purpose amen I was telling a man the other day about he's about killed himself drinking and doing drugs and a young man and and there he is about you know struggling to live and I said you you're missing purpose you ever get some purpose in your life then you won't be sitting around waiting on the first of the month for someone for some kind of a check coming from the government so that you can you drink yourself to a stupor and you're living in with those drugs because you have no purpose Hallelujah so my advice to him for him to get purpose is to get out and get a job get some purpose about you put some money in the bank amen get some purpose about you you ain't got no purpose and that you you feel worthless Hallelujah because you are worthless because you ain't doing what you were supposed to or you just put here on Earth to do get some get some purpose about you and get your responsibility back before you know it you ain't gonna be hiding behind the rock somewhere amen you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna stand up a little proud amen well praise the Lord and I want to tell you we we got too many of us in the church that's got a alcoholic's mentality that's what I always call it alcoholic mentality the woe is me mentality it's everyone else's fault and I can't ever succeed and it's it's you know and I've heard it all of my life who cares about their kids who cares about their family who cares about anything else amen they're just man my my my I'm just Hallelujah and I tell you we as a Believer as Christians we're not here amen just filling up time I'm here with purpose I'm here with Divine Purpose and because of Divine Purpose I don't have my head in the TV all the time and because of Divine Purpose I'm not listening to that radio all the time and because of Divine Purpose I'm not letting that Sports Animal stuff get Amen in my mind because I've got purpose Revelation has struck my heart you can't turn that you can't turn me away from it ever get me to go back to that Revelation has struck my heart can you say Amen I'll never be the same again I know who I am now I might have questioned what the message in the past I might have I might have had Tower times with television in the past I might have had a hard time amen with you know with the radio in the past and the talk show hosts in the past and listen to the conservative stock shows and all that that one yes yes yes but when Revelations struck I don't belong here and I know that if that word is going to have its effect in my life it's going to fall on good ground it's got to follow in good ground that means I've got to keep my garden well praise the Lord I've got to keep the ground right because I won revelation to have its perfect work I want these seeds these Divine seeds of this Bible to have such an effect in this human body it ain't nothing that this body can do and if you start putting it here your body will never produce the supernatural but I promise you if you weed your own garden this whole this old ground here and let him drop the seeds in by Revelation it'll change the way it'll change everything about you in fact it's going to produce a brand new body it's going to produce hallelujah it's going to put hair back on your head is that right hallelujah oh yeah yeah thing is the Divine words of eternal life that has the power of transformation who cares whether I have hair or whether I don't have hair who cares whether I live in a in a mansion or a shanty who cares only thing I want I want the seeds of God to grow in me I want revelation to be living in me can you say
