[33:42] foreign

[34:43] [Music]
[34:49] amen do you believe what you were
[34:51] singing there's never been a day like
[34:53] this day the Mysteries have been opened
[34:55] we see Who We Are
[34:57] we see the tricks and the tactics of the
[34:59] devil that should place the courage on
[35:00] the inside amen you happen to be in the
[35:03] house of the Lord
[35:04] amen it's good to see our visitors
[35:07] hope you all feel welcome this morning
[35:09] if you have your Bibles I've got two
[35:11] places uh in the scripture that I want
[35:13] to read
[35:14] the first one is Isaiah 53 and 1. we'll
[35:17] just read one
[35:19] verse there in Matthew 11 and 25.
[35:23] amen it's good to be a Christian amen
[35:27] I've been watching the services there in
[35:29] Hardy that our pastor and brother Andrew
[35:32] Glover and Daryl Ward is but Daryl's
[35:34] been preaching and they've been some
[35:36] outstanding services so we thank the
[35:38] Lord for that
[35:40] amen it's always it's always encouraging
[35:43] to see how God ain't just moving in one
[35:45] place but he's moving Nationwide
[35:46] worldwide wherever the message is being
[35:49] preached God is moving okay man I
[35:51] believe that with all my heart Isaiah 53
[35:54] and 1 who hath believed our report and
[35:57] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[36:00] then Matthew 11 and 25. brother Branham
[36:04] would say if you believe the report then
[36:06] the arm of the Lord is revealed so the
[36:08] strength or the power of the Lord the
[36:10] the hand of the Lord is always operated
[36:12] by faith it's operated by somebody
[36:15] believing it Matthew 11 and 25 at that
[36:18] time Jesus answered and said I thank
[36:20] thee your father Lord of Heaven and
[36:22] Earth because thou Hast hid these things
[36:24] from the wise and prudent and has
[36:27] revealed them unto babes even so father
[36:29] for so it seemed good in thy sight give
[36:32] me about our heads this morning
[36:34] dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[36:37] want to thank you for your grace and
[36:38] your mercy Lord that you've given us
[36:40] father placing a desire on the inside
[36:42] Lord draw and guess Lord to your house
[36:44] we ask God that you would move in a
[36:46] special way this morning you see the
[36:48] needs of the people father I ask that
[36:50] you would move me your word go to the
[36:52] need father may you bring healing
[36:53] Deliverance whatever it may be Lord we
[36:55] commit the service into your hands in
[36:58] Jesus name amen you may be seated
[37:01] and I just have a a simple thought this
[37:04] morning it would be the the right
[37:06] approach and I've been going through God
[37:08] hiding himself in Simplicity and
[37:10] revealing himself the same and it's a
[37:13] lot of what I'm going to be preaching
[37:14] this morning is going to be out of that
[37:16] that message and if you haven't heard it
[37:18] in a while or have never listened to it
[37:20] before it's a it's a good message to
[37:22] listen to but brother Branham says catch
[37:24] those two scriptures who have believed
[37:26] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[37:28] Lord revealed then Jesus thanked God
[37:31] that he hid the mysteries from the wise
[37:33] and prudent and revealed it to babes
[37:36] such as we'll learn for it seemed good
[37:38] to God to do that so God hid the
[37:41] mysteries from the wise and The Prudent
[37:43] and revealed them unto babes that were
[37:46] willing to learn so not everybody is
[37:48] going to see the arm of the Lord but
[37:51] it's the ones that are willing to learn
[37:52] to embrace the report and put it into
[37:55] action so that the arm of the Lord can
[37:58] be revealed so first you have to be
[38:00] really willing to be taught God you got
[38:02] to be willing to learn you got to be
[38:03] willing to say I don't know what all
[38:05] teach me you see you know somebody knows
[38:08] it all you know like electricity a lot
[38:10] of us are are some are Germans and
[38:12] contractors apprentices and if you
[38:14] already know it all the journeyman's not
[38:16] going to be able to teach you anything
[38:17] or the contractor ain't going to be able
[38:19] to teach you anything but if you're
[38:21] willing to learn you can experience the
[38:23] true power of electricity you can
[38:25] experience and you can know for yourself
[38:28] not with the head knowledge but once
[38:30] you're willing to learn then you can
[38:32] experience the true power of it in my
[38:35] that's the way it is with the scriptures
[38:36] with the message if you're willing to be
[38:38] taught if you're willing to learn if
[38:40] you're willing to say teach me then the
[38:43] arm of the Lord can be expressed not
[38:45] only to the preacher but it can be
[38:48] expressed to a teenager to a mama to a
[38:50] daddy to a to a young boy young girl but
[38:53] first you got to be willing to learn and
[38:55] say teach me teach me the strength of
[38:58] the Lord you see brother Branham says
[39:00] then when when we come sounds uh sanely
[39:03] sound to God when we come without malice
[39:06] any Prejudice and with an open heart
[39:08] willing to learn God's able to teach
[39:11] when we're willing to learn but first we
[39:14] have to lay us our Traditions lay aside
[39:16] our ideas what we've been taught now I
[39:18] know mother taught these taught you
[39:20] these things that was very good and so
[39:22] forth but sometimes mothers had things
[39:25] wrong and so I've given the example
[39:27] before but you can't go to a zero turn
[39:29] mower and try pushing it it's not meant
[39:32] to be operated that way you can't go to
[39:34] a push mower and try riding on it even
[39:36] though you got good intentions you're
[39:38] sincere you think that you're right but
[39:41] you're not going to go anywhere until
[39:42] it's operated like it's meant to be
[39:45] operated and once you sit on the Zero
[39:47] Turn instead of trying to push it then
[39:50] the power of that zero turn is starting
[39:52] to manifest itself then you're moving
[39:55] somewhere now you're cutting grass
[39:57] you're experiencing the true potential
[39:59] and all my Once We Lay tied what we
[40:02] think is right well our what our ideas
[40:04] are and embrace the true power of this
[40:07] message then once you go into action
[40:09] once you overcome things that you never
[40:12] could overcome once you push past ideas
[40:15] and traditions that you never could get
[40:17] past the first that starts with willing
[40:20] to be taught willing to say I don't know
[40:23] it all teach me something but you see
[40:25] like I said a few minutes earlier saying
[40:28] the arm of the Lord comes down to
[40:30] believing the report and brother Branham
[40:32] says it's a question then he's answering
[40:34] the question who who I believe the
[40:38] report and who is the arm of the Lord
[40:40] being revealed to and you see you can't
[40:42] experience the power of God unless you
[40:46] first believe it and operate it you look
[40:48] at John 11 and 25 Jesus said unto her I
[40:52] am the resurrection and the life he that
[40:55] believeth in me the hero dead yet he
[40:57] shall live and whatsoever whosoever
[41:00] liveth and believe believeth in me never
[41:02] shall die then he asked the question
[41:04] believeth thou this so he's saying hear
[41:07] the same word the spoke light in the
[41:10] beginning the same word the spoken Earth
[41:12] into existence the same word the prop
[41:15] this body out of the Tomb is the same
[41:19] word that can bring everybody out of the
[41:21] Tomb the container I take a generation
[41:24] and they can escape the the Griffin of
[41:27] the grip of death but believeth thou
[41:30] this so before you can operate the power
[41:33] of the Resurrection you've got to
[41:36] believe it before it can work for your
[41:38] life through your body you first have
[41:41] got to believe it and this is talking
[41:42] about Lazarus it was Martha that had the
[41:45] right approach brother Branham says she
[41:47] had a right to be mad at Jesus because
[41:49] he didn't come when she called for him
[41:52] but hurry her approach was that of Faith
[41:55] she said even now Lord if you speak the
[41:58] word I know my brother he will come out
[42:01] of that tomb it didn't matter the
[42:04] situations Hallelujah it didn't matter
[42:06] how tough death was how tough the grave
[42:10] was there was somebody that was
[42:12] operating the word like it was meant to
[42:15] be operated and I don't care how toughly
[42:18] going to see it is the spirits of
[42:20] laodicea is taking out this member
[42:22] taking up that member but there's a
[42:25] bride on Earth that's approaching the
[42:27] word Now with an idea not with a
[42:29] sensation but they're taking the word
[42:31] with faith the right approach and
[42:33] they're defeating every Spirit they're
[42:36] defeating every Spirit of lukewarmness
[42:38] and lay on a spirit of formalism there's
[42:41] a blind that is a marching step because
[42:44] they've got the right approach
[42:46] I am the resurrection and the life if
[42:50] you will believe on me he the same
[42:52] things that I am doing he will do and I
[42:56] could imagine that Jesus could have
[42:57] looked into the future and seen Jesus
[43:00] body coming out of the Tomb and from my
[43:03] and here I'm going to let Lazarus
[43:05] experience the same thing that I'm going
[43:09] to experience come on somebody it ain't
[43:11] just Jesus that's gonna rise out of the
[43:14] Grave or that rose out of the grave but
[43:16] Lazarus was experiencing the same power
[43:20] oh Hallelujah and it's not just the
[43:23] prophet that could speak the word and
[43:25] speak Miracles into existence it's not
[43:27] just Jesus that can curse the Fig Tree
[43:30] and there's a bride that is operating
[43:33] the word of God for this generation and
[43:36] have got the same manifestations of the
[43:39] spoken word Jesus said if you say unto
[43:43] this mountain and doubt not but you
[43:45] believe it it will happen as if I like
[43:49] that you say it it ain't just for me but
[43:51] it's for somebody that's got the right
[43:54] approach
[43:55] as for somebody that's got the right
[43:58] approach it ain't coming with their own
[44:01] ideas it's coming with faith believe us
[44:04] now this so you're you're your approach
[44:07] has first got to be right before you
[44:10] could operate what God has for this
[44:12] generation you remember brother Branham
[44:14] talks about the man he says I don't care
[44:18] if ten thousand Miracles I still don't
[44:21] believe in Divine Healing and brother
[44:23] Branham says sure it's not for
[44:25] unbelievers it's only for believers so
[44:28] in other words you can say that all you
[44:30] want it's not going to discourage me
[44:33] because there is somebody that is
[44:35] believing it that is approaching it the
[44:38] right away and miracles are still taking
[44:41] place and I can say that for this
[44:43] generation let them turn away from this
[44:46] message and say it's false and say that
[44:48] this was a false prophet but fear is
[44:51] still somebody that is experiencing the
[44:54] true power of this a message there's a
[44:56] victorious in life inside of a young
[44:58] person that's not being defiled by Lush
[45:01] not being defiled but pornography not
[45:04] being empowered by drinking marriages or
[45:07] being held together there's a group on
[45:10] earth that is experiencing the harm of
[45:13] the Lord because they are approaching it
[45:15] the right way you see Europe coach goes
[45:19] back to your expectation you see brother
[45:22] Branham says this uh now usually you get
[45:25] what you're expecting if you come to a
[45:27] meeting tonight to criticize or to make
[45:29] fun or to stir something up the devil
[45:32] will give you something to criticize he
[45:35] will give you something to arouse your
[45:37] curiosity and you just get what you're
[45:39] expecting if you come tonight expecting
[45:42] to see the Lord in this work and God
[45:44] will show himself and give you such a
[45:47] peace if you just come tonight expect
[45:49] you to be healed you will be healed you
[45:52] will get what you expect so he is saying
[45:55] if you come to a meeting even though the
[45:58] Supernatural is taking place healings
[46:00] can be taken place the arm of the Lord
[46:03] is revealing itself but if your
[46:05] expectation is that to criticize that
[46:09] all you're going to see but if your
[46:11] expectation is I'm going to see the arm
[46:14] of the Lord personally to me then that
[46:17] expectation will be fulfilled you know
[46:20] brother Branham says that the the the
[46:22] woman with the issue of blood expected
[46:25] to get her healing whenever she touched
[46:27] the garments of Jesus something of
[46:30] Simplicity she didn't even touch his leg
[46:32] or his foot she just touched the Garment
[46:35] just a little bit of that but that
[46:37] expectation brought the strength of the
[46:39] Lord down personal to her you might not
[46:42] know all the quotes you might not know
[46:44] all the scriptures but if you can just
[46:46] approach it in the Simplicity of Faith
[46:50] watch the arm of the Lord come in Mighty
[46:52] in battle and heal your body take that
[46:55] cancer away take that asthma away bring
[46:57] your loved ones back to the back to the
[47:00] Lord and fill them with the Holy Ghost
[47:01] it's up to your approach but it goes
[47:04] back to your expectation what are you
[47:07] expecting when you come to church is
[47:09] your expectation just well we're going
[47:12] to hear another sermon or where's your
[47:14] expectation I'm going to see God for me
[47:17] I'm going to see the Holy Ghost fall in
[47:20] my life I'm going to see healing take
[47:22] place in my home I don't care if this
[47:25] one's get touched if that one gets
[47:27] touched my expectation is for me to see
[47:31] the arm of the Lord Brother Branham says
[47:33] and you only get from God the things
[47:36] that you're expecting from God in the
[47:39] way you approach God you approach him
[47:41] with reverence with faith and every word
[47:44] is true so he's saying here you're
[47:46] expecting from God and the way you
[47:49] approach him so the way you approach him
[47:52] determines what your expectation is
[47:55] come on now your expectation is going to
[47:59] push the way you approach God so when
[48:01] you come to church and you're not
[48:03] expecting anything that's the way your
[48:05] approach is going to be but if there's
[48:07] somebody expecting to see God move them
[48:10] the approach changes I'm no longer just
[48:13] coming out of Duty but I'm expecting
[48:16] this to see the arm of the Lord to me
[48:19] then your approach changes saying God
[48:22] I'm coming to mean business I'm coming
[48:25] to get something from you your approach
[48:28] has changed and that's the way it is
[48:30] with the message of the hour if you're
[48:32] listening to the tapes and reading the
[48:34] books just to find something to
[48:36] criticize your expectation is going to
[48:39] push that approach and you're never
[48:41] going to you're never going to
[48:43] experience it but if your expectation
[48:46] goes from that so Lord speak to me teach
[48:50] me show me your ways show me your arm
[48:53] show me your power then by the
[48:55] expectation pushes that approach so I'm
[48:58] not finding something to criticize I'm
[49:01] finding the saith the Lord I'm finding
[49:04] the word the report for this state
[49:08] you see your approach goes back to your
[49:11] expectation but the Bible tells us how
[49:13] to approach him in Hebrews 11 6 but
[49:17] without faith it is impossible to please
[49:19] God for he that cometh to God must
[49:22] believe that he is and that he is a
[49:25] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[49:28] him so he's saying here you can't come
[49:31] to God saying I don't know if you're
[49:33] real you can't come to God saying I
[49:35] don't know if you can heal you can't
[49:37] come to God same cause the days of
[49:39] Miracles past you're never going to
[49:41] experience the arm of the Lord that way
[49:43] but if your approach changes to that of
[49:46] Faith saying Lord I know you're the same
[49:49] yesterday today and forever I know
[49:52] you're still filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:54] I know you still heal of cancer and then
[49:57] watch the arm of the Lord start to come
[50:00] down in a personal way you see faith is
[50:03] more than just saying I believe God it's
[50:06] more than just saying I'm a Christian
[50:08] because if it's just lip service then
[50:10] whenever doubt comes your faith is
[50:12] shaken you look at Matthew 15 and 8.
[50:15] this people drove of Nag unto me with
[50:17] their mouth and honoreth me with their
[50:19] lips but their heart is far from me you
[50:22] don't believe from your mind you believe
[50:24] from the soul you believe from the heart
[50:27] that's been transformed because when
[50:29] mind battles is going to attack the mind
[50:31] and your mind may get weary your mind
[50:34] may get weak but the soul that has been
[50:36] transformed will never get weary you can
[50:39] never burn out Faith you can never push
[50:41] out Faith whenever struggles and
[50:43] temptations comes that faith is always
[50:46] going to remain that's where we're
[50:48] believing from that's what we're
[50:50] approaching from is the soul that's been
[50:52] filled with the Holy Ghost
[50:55] there's no cancer that can burn out your
[50:58] faith Hallelujah there's no struggles
[51:00] there's nothing that can burn out the
[51:03] faith the approach of God
[51:06] Hallelujah I don't know where you're at
[51:08] this morning but if there's somebody
[51:09] that is needing healing in their body
[51:12] approach god with faith and say by your
[51:15] stripes I'm Healed you're the same
[51:17] yesterday today and forever my case may
[51:21] look impossible but I'm approaching the
[51:24] god
[51:25] of the possibility
[51:27] the Bible says now Faith is the
[51:29] substance of things hoped for the
[51:31] evidence of Things Not Seen so it's
[51:34] moved from just saying I believe God
[51:37] through there being a reality of I
[51:39] believe God you see faith is there is an
[51:43] anchor it's something that connects you
[51:45] with God but the Branham says many
[51:48] people replace Faith with hope I hope
[51:51] God can do this I hope God can do that I
[51:54] hope God can save me but there's no
[51:56] reality with hope there's no Assurance
[51:59] with hope but faith is an anchor it's a
[52:02] reality it's something that you can't
[52:05] see with a natural eye but faith is the
[52:08] substance of that's right about what
[52:10] you're believing for but you notice how
[52:12] the Bible says that faith is the
[52:14] substance of things hoped for so no
[52:18] longer is it something you're wishing
[52:20] and you're not hoping for it now there's
[52:22] a substance of something that you hope
[52:24] for
[52:26] there's now a substance of something you
[52:29] was wishing that you had now there's a
[52:31] reality that the arm of the Lord is now
[52:35] revealing itself in my life we're not
[52:38] hoping that we're going to make a
[52:40] Rapture but faith says nothing can keep
[52:43] me out of the Rapture we're not hoping
[52:45] that we're going to get a body change
[52:47] faith says nothing is going to keep me
[52:50] from getting my body changed hope says I
[52:54] hope there's a future home but faith
[52:56] says there's a future home that is on
[52:59] the other side of this Dimension Heaven
[53:01] Ain't a million miles away it's in
[53:03] another dimension that's what faith says
[53:06] faith says devil you better back up you
[53:09] better get out of my way I'm somebody
[53:11] let's approached God the right way in
[53:14] the arm of the Lord is being revealed
[53:18] it's showing its power through my life
[53:21] and every Temptation in every trial in
[53:24] every Circumstance the arm of the Lord
[53:27] is revealing itself
[53:29] so it's gone from a mythical hope a
[53:32] mythical heart to a reality but the
[53:35] Branham says it's absolutely substance
[53:38] it's absolutely material it's something
[53:40] that you can grab a hold of and say this
[53:43] is mine so it goes beyond what you see
[53:46] what you understand to a direct evidence
[53:49] of things you don't seem so faith is the
[53:52] key that unlocks the supernatural it
[53:55] opens the door you see if we didn't have
[53:58] a key like I think it was like three
[53:59] Sundays ago four Sundays ago whenever
[54:01] Dad was in Canada I come here all the
[54:04] doors were locked I couldn't get into
[54:06] the office I was supposed to preach that
[54:07] morning I didn't have a key to open the
[54:10] seal so everything that was behind that
[54:12] door was a mysterious it was something
[54:15] in a mysterious way I could guess what
[54:18] was behind that door but I didn't know
[54:20] with the Revelation what was behind that
[54:23] door I couldn't experience the power
[54:26] that was behind that door but then
[54:27] brother William come with the King that
[54:30] key unlocked the door and loose the seal
[54:33] where I could walk into the revelation
[54:36] of what was behind that door so now I'm
[54:39] no longer dashing what is behind that
[54:41] door but the key open the shell so that
[54:45] I could see and experience oh come on
[54:48] now you see we had a prophet in this day
[54:51] that come with the message and opened up
[54:54] the seals but without faith it's still
[54:57] going to be a sealed book it's going to
[54:59] remain in a mysterious way but Faith
[55:02] opens the door so that you can see what
[55:05] the prophet revealed in this generation
[55:07] well we're no longer guessing what is
[55:10] taking place but Faith takes what a
[55:13] prophet brought and brings it into
[55:15] reality oh come on somebody Faith makes
[55:18] this message alive Faith brings this
[55:20] message into reality it's more than
[55:23] tapes and books it's more than MP3s it's
[55:27] more than sermons it's a reality faith
[55:30] has brought the supernatural that this
[55:32] message has brought and put it into
[55:35] reality
[55:36] Hallelujah there's a power inside of
[55:40] this message that is keeping families
[55:42] together it's keeping young people out
[55:45] of pornography there's a power the arm
[55:47] of the Lord is expressing itself through
[55:51] a generation
[55:52] I believe her this morning somebody is
[55:55] expressing the strength of the Lord
[55:58] but faith is the key that unlocks the
[56:01] mysteries for this day it's the arm of
[56:04] the Lord that is now being expressed
[56:06] there's direct evidence of the arm of
[56:08] the Lord you see where faith is and
[56:10] doubt has no grounds whenever like I
[56:13] talked about the light wherever light is
[56:16] Darkness has to flee whenever there's
[56:18] Faith doubt has to leave so whenever the
[56:22] key of Faith opens the door there's no
[56:25] room for doubt because you can see what
[56:27] is there
[56:28] you know I if I never opened this door I
[56:32] could guess that there was a that there
[56:34] was an office chair there I could guess
[56:36] that there was a desk there because I
[56:38] didn't know I've never been in there
[56:40] before and so now there's doubts that I
[56:43] might not have a place to sit there's
[56:45] doubts that I might not have a desk to
[56:47] put my computer on there's doubts
[56:49] because I can't see what's behind that
[56:52] door but once I open the door all of the
[56:55] doubts vanish because I can see with my
[56:58] eye that there's a desk there I can see
[57:01] with my eye that there's a chair there
[57:03] doubt has no more room there because
[57:06] there's the key that opened my eyes and
[57:09] once you have faith can see what the
[57:12] prophet brought there's no room for
[57:14] doubt because you can see that there's a
[57:17] bride with the spot and wrinkle you can
[57:20] see it so there's no room for it out you
[57:23] see brother Branham says this and now we
[57:25] found salvation that will save us from
[57:28] sin though take the virus women or men
[57:31] drunk prostitute and make them a child
[57:33] of God well that same Faith the same
[57:36] power that will lift up a fallen man or
[57:39] a woman with that excuse me it'll work
[57:42] for us in many different ways it will
[57:45] heal our bodies if you can just find the
[57:48] right approach you've got to find how to
[57:51] do it so be saying here the same
[57:53] approach of faith that you used to be
[57:56] saved is the same approach of faith that
[57:59] you have to have to be healed the
[58:01] approach to God never changes you don't
[58:04] come to God with faith and become saved
[58:07] and then whenever you want to get the
[58:08] Holy Ghost the approach changes it's the
[58:11] same approach in every stage of the
[58:13] journey if you're in justification you
[58:16] have to have the approach of faith if
[58:18] it's sanctification you have to have the
[58:20] approach of faith if it's the Holy Ghost
[58:22] you have to have the approach of faith
[58:25] and here we are at the opening of the
[58:27] word it's the same approach that you
[58:30] needed for justification for
[58:32] sanctification for the Holy Ghost is the
[58:35] same approach that you have to have
[58:37] concerning the word for this generation
[58:40] not any approach is going to bring a
[58:43] revelation it's only the approach of
[58:46] Faith what do you mean by the approach
[58:48] of Faith it's coming up to it with no
[58:50] doubt no reasoning but only Faith saying
[58:54] whatever you speak to me Lord I'm going
[58:56] to believe it like whenever you go and
[58:58] read the Bible there's going to be
[59:00] atheists ideas there's going to be the
[59:02] Big Bang Theory there's going to be all
[59:04] of these other theories but whenever you
[59:07] come and read the Bible you push all of
[59:09] those theories away and approach it with
[59:12] faith saying whatever this says if a
[59:15] contradicts The Big Bang Theory my faith
[59:19] is right here if it contradicts what the
[59:22] atheists say my approach to Faith is
[59:25] ranked here and that's the way it is
[59:27] with the word that's been given in this
[59:30] generation all other ideas have got to
[59:33] go whenever you approach it with faith
[59:36] it may contradict what this one says it
[59:39] may contradict what mama says it may
[59:42] contradict what grandpa says but I'm
[59:44] approaching the word for this day with
[59:47] faith now we're skeptical now with
[59:49] Skeptics not with ideas of this one or
[59:52] that one but I'm approaching it with the
[59:54] faith saying Lord this is for me but you
[59:58] see me where many people fall is this
[1:00:01] hid from the eyes of the wise and
[1:00:03] prudent and revealed unto babes but the
[1:00:05] Branham says it's coming in a simple way
[1:00:08] that the wise Overlook it that's coming
[1:00:11] in a way the third now willing to learn
[1:00:13] from simplicity
[1:00:17] it's true Dylan if you knew something
[1:00:21] that Miguel didn't know he's going to
[1:00:23] have a hard time listening to you just
[1:00:25] because he's somebody he's been
[1:00:27] Apprentice he's been a tournament he's
[1:00:29] been a contractor and here you are you
[1:00:31] don't even got your Apprentice card yet
[1:00:33] and so why would he listen to somebody
[1:00:36] that is so simple come on now and that's
[1:00:39] that that's the thinking of the
[1:00:41] generation is I've been to college I've
[1:00:43] been to Seminary I've been here I've
[1:00:46] been there and this is somebody that
[1:00:48] didn't even finish high school he's down
[1:00:50] going to college he didn't go to Bible
[1:00:52] school but it was a Simplicity the God
[1:00:55] was revealing him through and but if
[1:00:58] there's somebody that is willing to
[1:00:59] learn saying the Lord teach me
[1:01:03] teach me your ways show me your arm show
[1:01:07] me your power I'm going to believe the
[1:01:10] report of the Lord it may be hid from
[1:01:13] the wise it may be hid from The Prudent
[1:01:15] but I'm somebody that is willing to
[1:01:17] learn
[1:01:19] oh my brother Branham tells the story of
[1:01:22] Mr Dorsey he was an old man around 85
[1:01:24] years old he said he was in the Civil
[1:01:26] War he has seen a lot of things he has
[1:01:29] seen the world changed in a lot of ways
[1:01:31] and he says there was a little girl that
[1:01:33] was heading to Sunday school and this
[1:01:35] man stopped and he says little girl
[1:01:37] where are you going and then she says
[1:01:39] sir I'm going to Sunday school and he
[1:01:42] says don't you know that's a waste of
[1:01:44] time he said she said no sir it's not
[1:01:46] she says how do you know that God is
[1:01:49] real and brother Brandon says she
[1:01:50] stopped have picked up a little flower
[1:01:52] and says Mr Darcy where did this flower
[1:01:55] come from
[1:01:56] where did it come from where did the
[1:01:59] seed come from where did the Earth come
[1:02:02] from and brother Branham says it was
[1:02:04] through Simplicity that that man gave us
[1:02:07] heart to Christ because it was through
[1:02:09] the Simplicity of a little girl if a
[1:02:12] little girl can explain God then the
[1:02:15] wisest of the man should turn around and
[1:02:17] say give me what you got and that's what
[1:02:20] this message has done it's coming
[1:02:23] simplicity so the children can
[1:02:25] understand that somebody that never
[1:02:28] graduated can understand somebody that
[1:02:31] was never able to read can understand it
[1:02:34] come in simplicity so that no matter
[1:02:36] where you're at in life you can
[1:02:39] understand the arm of the Lord
[1:02:42] it's come in Simplicity where we can see
[1:02:45] it but the Branham says it's crazy to
[1:02:48] think that how he hides himself in
[1:02:51] Simplicity and reveals himself in
[1:02:54] Simplicity where the wise can't even see
[1:02:57] it but he says God makes himself so
[1:03:00] simple so nobody can miss it he refers
[1:03:03] back to the scripture in Isaiah 35 and 8
[1:03:06] and the highway shall be there in a way
[1:03:09] it shall be called the way of Holiness
[1:03:11] the unclean shall not pass over it but
[1:03:14] it shall be for those the way fearing
[1:03:16] man the fools should not error therein
[1:03:20] he says it's made so simple that even
[1:03:22] the fools can understand him but the
[1:03:25] wise are not able to go over it oh my
[1:03:29] the brother Branham says whenever God is
[1:03:32] going to deliver he comes with the
[1:03:34] message he sends a message to the people
[1:03:37] that is so simple that the wise don't
[1:03:40] see it oh this is okay this evening I've
[1:03:42] been going through this and it's been
[1:03:43] it's been coming real to me but he says
[1:03:46] that you can look at Moses his family
[1:03:48] his his dad you don't even know of he
[1:03:51] was a son from Levi but you don't even
[1:03:53] know nothing else his mom was just an
[1:03:56] ordinary slave a mud dauber that was
[1:03:58] making bricks for the Egyptians but God
[1:04:01] called called A simple family to bring
[1:04:04] forth the deliverer for that generation
[1:04:07] and he says he had to keep Moses simple
[1:04:10] he says he allowed Moses to go into
[1:04:13] Pharaoh's house and get an education he
[1:04:16] says he was a ruler he conquered Nations
[1:04:18] around him he was a general but he
[1:04:21] needed Moses to topple so that he could
[1:04:24] know but only through Simplicity will
[1:04:27] Deliverance take place and he says what
[1:04:30] happened he got one dead Egyptian that's
[1:04:33] what his education got was one dead
[1:04:35] Egyptian but he allowed him to Tumble
[1:04:38] and go into the desert so all of that
[1:04:40] education could be bitten out of him so
[1:04:44] that he could come with Simplicity
[1:04:46] because that's the way that Deliverance
[1:04:49] was going to take place was through
[1:04:51] Simplicity and what happened it was
[1:04:54] Simplicity the Bright Lights Out of
[1:04:56] Heaven it was Simplicity the the frogs
[1:05:00] it was Simplicity that turned the water
[1:05:02] in the blood it was Simplicity that
[1:05:05] split the Red Sea it was Simplicity the
[1:05:08] prop Manor Out of Heaven it was
[1:05:10] Simplicity the brought water out of a
[1:05:12] rock and it's been Simplicity that
[1:05:15] squirrels were spoken into existence it
[1:05:18] was through Simplicity the Hattie rights
[1:05:20] thought our loved ones to be saved and
[1:05:23] it's through Simplicity that there's a
[1:05:25] pride with our spots and without wrinkle
[1:05:27] is through Simplicity the sure going to
[1:05:30] make a rapture
[1:05:32] you might not understand that but it's
[1:05:34] so simple that you can't help but
[1:05:36] believe it
[1:05:38] it's coming such a simple way that the
[1:05:41] heavens declared it there were seven
[1:05:43] angels that went up into the heavens the
[1:05:46] the pillar of fire come down in Houston
[1:05:49] and in this picture taken with him there
[1:05:52] was another pictures that were taken of
[1:05:54] the pillar of fire it's common such a
[1:05:57] simple way that you can't help but
[1:06:00] believe it
[1:06:01] if you're willing to learn
[1:06:03] see that's what it comes down to is what
[1:06:06] is your approach to this word going to
[1:06:09] be
[1:06:10] come on now what is your approach to
[1:06:13] this word going to be brother Branham
[1:06:15] says when he couldn't do it by military
[1:06:18] training or by an education by
[1:06:21] scientific education or by a military
[1:06:24] force he could not do it he gave him an
[1:06:27] old cricket stick off of the desert and
[1:06:30] he did it with that God in humility
[1:06:33] Simplicity God was in that stick and
[1:06:37] then Moses and as long as Moses had the
[1:06:40] stick have the Simplicity then God had
[1:06:43] it because God was with Moses as long as
[1:06:46] Moses stayed with the Simplicity of that
[1:06:50] message God was with him oh come on now
[1:06:54] we got too many people that are trying
[1:06:56] to make this message so complicated and
[1:06:59] so profound and so big it's really not
[1:07:02] that big it's simple men make it
[1:07:06] confusing but the prophet brought a
[1:07:09] simple message
[1:07:10] oh come on now
[1:07:12] you see this message ain't to bring you
[1:07:15] into confusion is to bring you out it's
[1:07:17] not to take you back it was a Moses
[1:07:20] message that was having the people go
[1:07:22] around the Wilderness for 20 years it
[1:07:25] was a Moses message Moses message was
[1:07:27] through Joshua and Caleb going into the
[1:07:30] promised land you see it was a Moses it
[1:07:33] was the men inside of that message I'm
[1:07:35] preaching now that was causing confusion
[1:07:37] and that caused them to go in the
[1:07:40] wilderness for 20 years but there was a
[1:07:43] Joshua and Caleb that says my Approach
[1:07:45] is only to this message by faith I don't
[1:07:49] care what the distance in the chorus are
[1:07:52] saying this is a message that's coming
[1:07:54] Simplicity let us Call My Name give me
[1:07:57] my Mountain give me my inheritance
[1:08:00] paintable saying I might be 85 years old
[1:08:03] but I don't care the Simplicity of this
[1:08:06] message told me it's mine my inheritance
[1:08:10] is mine I'm willing to fight for it let
[1:08:12] me this morning are you willing to fight
[1:08:15] for it are you willing to remain in
[1:08:18] Simplicity and say give me my Mountain
[1:08:20] give me my inheritance give me my
[1:08:22] healing give me the Holy Ghost give me
[1:08:25] my loved ones give me my family
[1:08:28] yes as for me and my house I'm going to
[1:08:32] serve the Lord
[1:08:34] give me my mountain
[1:08:36] you look at Caleb Caleb's response was
[1:08:40] the same as Moses you know what I said
[1:08:42] what did Moses say I want to go tell
[1:08:45] Moses I have come down to deliver them
[1:08:47] to bring them out of that land into a
[1:08:50] good land flowing with milk and honey
[1:08:53] and what was Caleb saying whenever they
[1:08:55] was on the border of the inheritance he
[1:08:58] says he has given us this land flowing
[1:09:00] with the milk and honey his reports did
[1:09:04] not change from Moses's report come on
[1:09:07] now his report was the same as the
[1:09:10] message
[1:09:11] I'm preaching now and what happened he
[1:09:15] got the same results that the message
[1:09:17] promised come on now if he would just
[1:09:20] stay with that message the prophecy the
[1:09:23] message prompt which starts upon the
[1:09:25] past and if you can just stay with this
[1:09:28] message the Simplicity of it you will
[1:09:31] see the prophecy of a Rapture come the
[1:09:34] past you will see the prophecy of the
[1:09:37] future home come to pass
[1:09:40] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:43] Joshua and Caleb look crazy
[1:09:46] but as for me and my house we will serve
[1:09:48] the Lord
[1:09:50] we're going to serve the Lord we're
[1:09:52] following this message it was the wise
[1:09:55] men who seen the star there was no
[1:09:57] bodies but they was willing to follow it
[1:09:59] there was rulings they recognized the
[1:10:02] business scripture coming to pass you
[1:10:04] look at numbers 24 and 17 and I shall
[1:10:07] see him but not now I Shall Behold Him
[1:10:10] but not nigh there shall come a star out
[1:10:13] of Jacob by the praying them says
[1:10:15] whenever they seen the star they
[1:10:17] referred back to numbers he says one of
[1:10:20] them stop and he says go get the Scrolls
[1:10:23] go get the Scrolls what does the scroll
[1:10:26] say about a star and whenever they
[1:10:28] looked at the scroll a revelation took
[1:10:31] place and when the praying them says
[1:10:33] they left the fire that they was around
[1:10:36] and ran into the tower they didn't need
[1:10:39] the man-made light anymore there was a
[1:10:42] star a scriptural prophecy that was now
[1:10:45] shining the light and you look what the
[1:10:47] Bible says in Matthew 2 and 10 when they
[1:10:50] saw the star they rejoiced with
[1:10:52] exceedingly great joy because they knew
[1:10:56] that all the astrologers wasn't looking
[1:10:58] up the skies all of the smart men was
[1:11:01] looking out the skies but they don't see
[1:11:04] what I see they don't understand what I
[1:11:07] see they should be following there
[1:11:09] should be astrologers everywhere
[1:11:11] following this star but they could not
[1:11:13] say it but these three men started to
[1:11:16] Rejoice saying we see the star we see
[1:11:19] the light this ain't just something
[1:11:21] happening by chance but this is a
[1:11:24] scripture light that is the leading us
[1:11:26] how come they follow the star there is a
[1:11:29] revelation knowing if there's a star
[1:11:31] there's got to be a scripture anointed
[1:11:34] one on the earth that this is a leading
[1:11:36] us too and once the Bible say they
[1:11:38] follow the star they said we sing the
[1:11:41] star in the east I believe and they
[1:11:43] followed it and they come into the City
[1:11:45] and the Bible says that they started to
[1:11:48] make started to demand where is he that
[1:11:51] is born King of the Jews will fall on
[1:11:54] the star show me the arm of the Lord
[1:11:55] show me the strength of the Lord show me
[1:11:58] the power of his resurrection we're not
[1:12:01] following as if I Stables we're not
[1:12:04] falling something in our imagination
[1:12:05] show us the power of the Lord and they
[1:12:09] did not stop until they wrapped the feet
[1:12:12] of Jesus the arm of the Lord they now
[1:12:15] could see him
[1:12:17] oh what's the bible say that there was
[1:12:19] to be a star in each of the church ages
[1:12:22] what is that star it's an angel It's a
[1:12:25] messenger that was to bring the message
[1:12:27] bring an interpretation show to you the
[1:12:30] arm of the Lord that's what we're
[1:12:33] following is the light oh you notice how
[1:12:35] the Bible says though whenever the wise
[1:12:37] man they come to the city in Matthew 2
[1:12:40] and 1 and now when Jesus was born in
[1:12:43] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[1:12:46] the king behold there come wise men from
[1:12:48] the East to Jerusalem saying where is he
[1:12:51] that is born King of the Jews for we
[1:12:54] have seen his star
[1:12:57] and we have seen history not a star but
[1:13:01] we have seen his star the king of the
[1:13:03] Jews the one we're looking for we have
[1:13:06] found this star and let me say this we
[1:13:09] have found the star the the messenger
[1:13:11] for laodicea we have found the star he
[1:13:15] has led us to Jesus Christ he has
[1:13:17] allowed us to the strength of the Lord
[1:13:21] Hallelujah he's allowed us to it that's
[1:13:24] why they couldn't be they couldn't help
[1:13:26] but rejoice when they're seen his star
[1:13:28] because they knew that there's something
[1:13:31] on Earth taking place there's a
[1:13:33] supernatural taking place in what is
[1:13:35] Matthew 13 and 16 say blessed are your
[1:13:38] eyes for they seem and your ears for
[1:13:41] they hear something is taking place in
[1:13:45] this generation that we're recognizing
[1:13:47] the star we're recognizing that this
[1:13:50] ain't something by accident but there's
[1:13:53] a fullness taken place you see brother
[1:13:55] Branham said the wise men of today will
[1:13:58] not follow crage they will not follow
[1:14:00] dogmas but will follow the god-given
[1:14:03] spoken word till they see the fullness
[1:14:06] of the power and that's what the wise
[1:14:09] men were looking show us the king what
[1:14:11] is the king one with power one with
[1:14:14] authority we've seen a star but show us
[1:14:17] the King and I will say that's our
[1:14:20] attitude today we have seen a star we
[1:14:23] have found the message we've seen the
[1:14:25] anointing but show us the king I want to
[1:14:28] see the Lord Mighty in battle not for
[1:14:31] the preacher but for me I want to see
[1:14:34] the arm of the Lord Heal My Body I want
[1:14:36] to say the arm of the Lord fill my
[1:14:39] daughter with the Holy Ghost show us the
[1:14:42] king
[1:14:43] show us the one with authority show us
[1:14:46] the one with power
[1:14:48] we have seen his star
[1:14:50] show us the fullness of the power of God
[1:14:53] show us it
[1:14:55] but you notice how the Bible calls them
[1:14:57] wise men
[1:14:58] but you go back to Jesus Jesus says that
[1:15:02] the wise and The Prudent no no the
[1:15:04] Mysteries but at the same time the Bible
[1:15:07] calls these ones what and I thought my
[1:15:11] then I started searching it out you look
[1:15:13] at James 3 and 14 but ye have bitter
[1:15:15] envying Strife in your hearts Glory not
[1:15:18] to lie not against the truth this wisdom
[1:15:21] this sendeth not from above but is
[1:15:24] Earthly Central devilish for we're
[1:15:26] envying Strife is there was confusion in
[1:15:30] every evil work so the wisdom that is of
[1:15:33] the earth brings confusion but to come
[1:15:36] down to the next verse but the wisdom
[1:15:38] that is from above is first core and
[1:15:42] then Peaceable gentle easy to being
[1:15:44] treated full of Mercy good fruits and he
[1:15:46] says without hypocrisy and so there's
[1:15:49] one wisdom that is of the earth that is
[1:15:52] bringing bringing a confusion but at the
[1:15:54] same time there's a Heavenly wisdom that
[1:15:58] is coming down to earth and it's
[1:16:00] bringing us security so the approach of
[1:16:03] worldly wisdom is what wrong and so the
[1:16:06] wise is a missing the Mysteries because
[1:16:10] of their wisdom but to the bride because
[1:16:13] of the Mysteries there's a wisdom that
[1:16:16] has been given to this generation we're
[1:16:19] not walking around in confusion but
[1:16:22] there's been a wisdom that has been
[1:16:24] given in this day you see brother
[1:16:27] Branham says that and so the wisdom that
[1:16:29] I want to get I want to get straightened
[1:16:31] out before we start there was a wisdom
[1:16:34] of God a wisdom of God is to stay with
[1:16:37] the word but Satan in his wisdom trying
[1:16:40] to twist the word so that's the wisdom
[1:16:43] I'm speaking of he's talking about
[1:16:45] wisdom versus faith and we see what
[1:16:48] happened at the fall in the beginning it
[1:16:50] was because of the Simplicity of God's
[1:16:53] orders you know God only said a couple
[1:16:55] things he says you can eat of this fruit
[1:16:58] or eat of this tree all the trees in the
[1:17:00] garden it but this one you cannot
[1:17:02] partake of it was a simple demand or
[1:17:06] simple command but it was through the
[1:17:08] wisdom of the serpent that she did away
[1:17:11] with the Simplicity you look at Genesis
[1:17:14] 3 and 5 for God does know in the day you
[1:17:17] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:17:19] opened and you shall be as God knowing
[1:17:22] good and evil you notice where did the
[1:17:25] serpent attack Eve he did not come and
[1:17:28] say God didn't create the heavens God is
[1:17:31] the one the creator of the earth God
[1:17:33] ain't the one the creator of the animals
[1:17:35] he come through the Simplicity of God's
[1:17:38] word
[1:17:39] he he didn't go to the doctrines he'll
[1:17:42] come to the Simplicity Heaven Come on
[1:17:45] follow me now he didn't go and say God
[1:17:47] ain't a God he is the creator but he
[1:17:50] come to his word he wasn't denying but
[1:17:53] there wasn't a God but he was denying
[1:17:55] the power of His word
[1:17:58] that the devil well it's okay with you
[1:18:01] coming to church and raising your hand
[1:18:03] but once it comes to the approach of
[1:18:06] Faith to his word that's where he's
[1:18:09] going to attack every time and that's
[1:18:12] where he fell she started to embrace the
[1:18:15] wisdom of the world and whenever she
[1:18:18] embraced the wisdom of the world she
[1:18:20] refused the wisdom of God but you notice
[1:18:24] what the Bible says he says you will be
[1:18:26] as gods that was already as God's Adam
[1:18:31] was already speaking to the storm he was
[1:18:34] speaking to Nature he named all the
[1:18:36] animals the Bible says so he was already
[1:18:39] living in the position of a minor God
[1:18:42] because of the wisdom of God come on now
[1:18:46] and so what the devil was doing through
[1:18:48] worldly wisdom was to bring them from
[1:18:51] their position
[1:18:52] and that's what the devil is trying to
[1:18:54] do to the pride of Christ he knows that
[1:18:57] there's a God he can't argue that with
[1:18:59] you he knows that God has saved your
[1:19:02] soul he can't argue with that but what
[1:19:04] he will do will try to bring you from
[1:19:07] your position as a as a minor God that
[1:19:10] could speak to the sickness that can
[1:19:12] speak to the circumstances he comes with
[1:19:15] worldly wisdom it says God don't mean
[1:19:18] that God don't God's God's unfilled with
[1:19:21] the Holy Ghost anymore he may have
[1:19:23] filled you but your children they can't
[1:19:25] be healed with the Holy Ghost your
[1:19:27] grandpa might have got a hill from
[1:19:29] cancer but your children they can't get
[1:19:32] healed anymore what he is doing is he's
[1:19:35] coming with worldly wisdom trying to
[1:19:38] pull you from your position but I say
[1:19:41] don't listen to worldly wisdom listen to
[1:19:45] the wisdom the goddess sent in this
[1:19:48] generation
[1:19:50] Hallelujah so now Adam and Eve is no
[1:19:54] longer speaking to the storm but they're
[1:19:56] looking for shelter they're no longer
[1:19:58] petting Leo the Lion but now they're
[1:20:00] running from Leo the Lion they're not
[1:20:02] living eternally no longer but now
[1:20:04] they've got aches and they've got pains
[1:20:06] that's why worldly wisdom will do but
[1:20:10] there's been a wisdom that's been given
[1:20:12] in this neighbor the praying them says
[1:20:14] the worldly wisdom is what is destroying
[1:20:16] the Earth worldly wisdom he says you've
[1:20:19] got gunpowder you've got gases you've
[1:20:21] got electricity it's all destroying the
[1:20:24] Earth so worldly wisdom is destroying
[1:20:27] the Earth but the Heavenly wisdom is
[1:20:30] what's going to redeem the Earth the
[1:20:32] worldly wisdom is destroying man's
[1:20:35] bodies through drugs through vaping
[1:20:37] through smoking through all of these uh
[1:20:40] all these foods and everything but it's
[1:20:42] the Heavenly wisdom that is going to
[1:20:44] redeem the bodies of the brine
[1:20:47] there's a worldly wisdom but at the same
[1:20:50] time through Simplicity God has given us
[1:20:54] a wisdom
[1:20:57] Hallelujah he's given us something you
[1:21:00] look at Genesis 2 and 17 but the tree of
[1:21:03] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:21:06] the knowledge that's what is being
[1:21:09] partaken of today is knowledge we're
[1:21:12] smart the Bible says in first our second
[1:21:14] Timothy 3 and 7 ever learning and never
[1:21:17] able to come to the knowledge of the
[1:21:19] truth there's two knowledges they're
[1:21:22] eating of the knowledge of the world but
[1:21:25] since they're eating of that since
[1:21:26] they're approaching that the knowledge
[1:21:29] of the truth the wisdom they cannot
[1:21:32] partake of
[1:21:34] oh my but this is the age of
[1:21:37] intelligence the world is so smart but
[1:21:40] at the same time there's an intelligence
[1:21:41] that's been given to the bride oh my
[1:21:44] here here's the quote I was talking
[1:21:46] about brother Branham says he's
[1:21:47] destroyed himself with this gunpowder if
[1:21:50] it's electric lights it pulls gases out
[1:21:52] of the earth wisdom root to and fro
[1:21:54] knowledge shall increase and they
[1:21:56] brought themselves a hydrogen bomb now I
[1:21:58] don't know what they're going to do
[1:22:00] automobiles every time a man God
[1:22:02] destroys nothing man destroys himself by
[1:22:06] worldly wisdom the first conflicts that
[1:22:08] ever come to the world was because of
[1:22:11] somebody was seeking after worldly
[1:22:14] wisdom instead of simple faith
[1:22:18] there's the approach he says they're
[1:22:20] seeking after worldly wisdom instead of
[1:22:24] simple Faith so the way to approach God
[1:22:27] the Simplicity of God is through simple
[1:22:30] Faith the mystery of God is hid from the
[1:22:34] wise and prudent but at the same time
[1:22:36] the Bible says this in Ephesians 1 and 8
[1:22:39] wherein he hath abounded towards us in
[1:22:42] all wisdom and prudence
[1:22:44] so this is the same thing that the wise
[1:22:48] can't see because of this they're saying
[1:22:50] they don't understand the Mysteries
[1:22:52] because they're wise and prudent but at
[1:22:54] the same time he hath abandoned toward
[1:22:56] us in all wisdom and Prudence what's the
[1:23:00] difference having made known unto us the
[1:23:03] mystery of his will so the world has
[1:23:07] been a reversed they're trying to figure
[1:23:10] out the Mysteries through their wisdom
[1:23:12] but the pride through wisdom or through
[1:23:16] the Mysteries has figured our wisdom
[1:23:19] hallelujah we're the right wisest group
[1:23:22] on Earth that may have went to college
[1:23:24] seminaries Bible colleges but there's a
[1:23:27] wisdom that is surpassing the world
[1:23:29] surpassing the ones with the highest
[1:23:32] degrees surpassing and one day where
[1:23:35] this wisdom is going to change our
[1:23:38] bodies
[1:23:39] hallelujah it's something that is
[1:23:42] transforming our life it's so simple but
[1:23:45] I can't help but believe it the Bible
[1:23:48] says in First Corinthians 2 and 4 and my
[1:23:51] speech and my preaching was not in not
[1:23:54] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[1:23:57] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:24:00] power
[1:24:02] so he's saying here man's Wisdom would
[1:24:05] not produce the demonstration of the arm
[1:24:08] of the Lord
[1:24:09] I'm not coming to you with man's Wisdom
[1:24:12] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:24:15] of power that your faith should not
[1:24:18] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:24:21] power of God albeit we speak wisdom
[1:24:24] among them that are perfect yet not the
[1:24:27] wisdom of this world nor of the princess
[1:24:30] of this world and come to not but we
[1:24:33] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
[1:24:36] even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:24:38] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[1:24:41] he says it's a hidden wisdom but not
[1:24:45] everybody can see but the simple but the
[1:24:49] ones that are willing to be that's
[1:24:50] willing to be to be taught they're the
[1:24:53] ones that the the mystery the wisdom is
[1:24:56] being restored to you see that's the
[1:24:59] only way you can approach God approach
[1:25:02] the Simplicity it's by faith you look up
[1:25:05] at the random says oh you say oh the
[1:25:06] morning star and the evening star is
[1:25:09] both the same Darcy the same light that
[1:25:12] was given in the morning does the same
[1:25:14] in the evening it's the same Evening
[1:25:16] Star the world has just turned around
[1:25:18] let's all see so it's not so complicated
[1:25:21] after all it's just simple Faith to
[1:25:25] believe God notice the Way Up Is Down it
[1:25:28] is said we must believe God we must take
[1:25:31] all his word we must not try to figure
[1:25:34] things out
[1:25:35] he says just believe it so you don't got
[1:25:38] to figure out if thou the evening star
[1:25:40] is there in the evening and The Morning
[1:25:42] Star it's in the morning you don't got
[1:25:45] to figure it out it's the same star in
[1:25:48] other words don't complicate it just
[1:25:50] believe that it's going to happen
[1:25:52] nothing can keep that from coming to
[1:25:55] pass so the same Sun the rose in the
[1:25:58] East is the same Sun that is going to
[1:26:00] set in the west the same the Jehovah of
[1:26:04] the old is Jesus of the new the purifier
[1:26:07] of the Old Testament is the same pair of
[1:26:10] fire of the new and the same color of
[1:26:13] fire that appeared above our Prophet we
[1:26:16] don't gotta figure it out how simple
[1:26:18] faith and believe it the same Holy Ghost
[1:26:22] the fell in the upper room is the same
[1:26:24] holy ghost that is falling today the
[1:26:27] same power the hill blind bolameus is
[1:26:30] the same power that is Healing The Sick
[1:26:32] that is setting the the captives free we
[1:26:35] we don't gotta figure it out it's simple
[1:26:37] faith in the simplicity
[1:26:41] we don't got to figure out electricity
[1:26:44] we don't got to figure it out all we got
[1:26:46] to do is hook up the panel and flip on
[1:26:48] the breakers there was already somebody
[1:26:50] else that figured out how it works you
[1:26:53] see if there's some electricians here
[1:26:55] and we've we put in panels but the worst
[1:26:57] thing that people can do is try to
[1:26:59] figure out the problems on their own and
[1:27:02] so what happens is they get it all mixed
[1:27:04] up they get everything all confused
[1:27:06] because they're trying to figure
[1:27:08] something out that somebody else has
[1:27:11] already figured out come on now we don't
[1:27:13] got to try to figure out how all of
[1:27:15] these things is going to take place all
[1:27:18] I know is I'm going to make a Rapture
[1:27:20] all I know is I'm the Spotless Pride
[1:27:23] that he saw before the foundation of the
[1:27:27] world
[1:27:28] hey come on now we don't gotta try to
[1:27:31] figure it out just have faith in it
[1:27:34] you see what did Benjamin Franklin do he
[1:27:37] just discovered what was already there
[1:27:39] he didn't create electricity he just
[1:27:42] discovered what everybody was living
[1:27:44] without and so after it was discovered
[1:27:46] nobody else had to go out and try to
[1:27:49] discover it it was already found now the
[1:27:51] only thing the people had to do was take
[1:27:54] what he discovered and put it into
[1:27:56] action Put on turn on my light bulb turn
[1:27:59] on the switch we don't gotta go with the
[1:28:02] tank and trying to figure it out it's
[1:28:04] already been figured out we don't got to
[1:28:07] try to interpret the word it's already
[1:28:09] been interpreted
[1:28:13] oh my God but what happens is we get a
[1:28:17] lot of preachers and turn off the
[1:28:18] breakers and say God don't heal no more
[1:28:20] turn the breaker off God don't fill it
[1:28:22] the Holy Ghost turns the breaker off and
[1:28:24] so now the Lance is going off just in
[1:28:26] this building all the other people's got
[1:28:28] electricity all the other buildings have
[1:28:30] power all the other homes has got
[1:28:33] electricity but once you start to turn
[1:28:36] off Breakers you're losing power in your
[1:28:38] own building and that's what happens
[1:28:40] when you do away with scripture oh man
[1:28:43] Malachi 4 that's not for today you're
[1:28:45] flipping off of that oh God don't heal
[1:28:47] no more you're flipping off a lack oh
[1:28:49] God don't save anymore you're flipping
[1:28:51] off a lot but turn on the breakers the
[1:28:54] electricity is here the arm of the Lord
[1:28:57] is here the power of God is here to
[1:29:00] change bodies to change lives turn on
[1:29:03] the lights turn on the power turn on the
[1:29:07] strength of the Lord
[1:29:09] oh Hallelujah if the Bible says it we
[1:29:13] can believe it if the Bible says that we
[1:29:15] can March over the ashes of the wicked
[1:29:18] work on a March if the Bible says
[1:29:20] believe and you can speak the word I'm
[1:29:23] gonna speak the word if the Bible says
[1:29:25] by your stripes I'm Healed I'm going to
[1:29:28] believe it if the Bible says it I
[1:29:31] believe it I don't gotta figure it out I
[1:29:34] believe it brother Branham says God
[1:29:36] always sins or Revival well uh before
[1:29:40] they write about he says just simple
[1:29:41] Faith to take him at his word or that
[1:29:44] they trying to complicate it they try to
[1:29:46] make it so great and then he says God's
[1:29:49] sins always sins are Revival of
[1:29:51] Simplicity that preach the thing to
[1:29:54] Pieces that's right that's what we need
[1:29:56] today it's the simpleness that's what
[1:29:59] the nation needs today it's the
[1:30:01] Simplicity of faith in Christ to
[1:30:04] surrender themselves unselfishly with
[1:30:07] their whole heart
[1:30:09] he says that's what they did in England
[1:30:10] they made that that that that that
[1:30:12] message so complicated that people
[1:30:16] couldn't understand it and he says God
[1:30:18] always sins simplicity
[1:30:20] so break that up and let the people know
[1:30:23] it's simple if you can just put your
[1:30:26] faith in it if you can just believe it
[1:30:30] oh my
[1:30:32] what a Matthew 16 and 16 say and Simon
[1:30:35] Peter answered and said thou what the
[1:30:37] Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:30:40] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:30:42] are thou Simon barjona for Flesh and
[1:30:45] Blood hath not revealed this unto thee
[1:30:47] for worthy wisdom has not revealed unto
[1:30:50] you but my Father which is in heaven the
[1:30:53] Heavenly wisdom has brought this
[1:30:55] Revelation he says you're blessed and I
[1:30:58] say if you've got a revelation with this
[1:31:01] heavenly wisdom you're blessed because
[1:31:03] not everybody can sin but blessed are
[1:31:06] you
[1:31:07] it was through the Simplicity of faith
[1:31:09] that Peter would say thou art the Christ
[1:31:11] it was the Simplicity of faith that
[1:31:14] Peter would say where would we go for
[1:31:17] thou Hast the words of eternal life he
[1:31:19] couldn't explain it but he believed it
[1:31:21] it was the Simplicity of Faith you know
[1:31:24] it was Jesus that says if you eat my
[1:31:26] flesh and Shrink my blood you don't have
[1:31:29] no part in me if you don't do these
[1:31:31] things and the Bible says the multitudes
[1:31:33] turned away and they walked away brother
[1:31:35] random says they were thinking he's a
[1:31:37] vampire he's this he's that and Jesus
[1:31:40] turned around to the twelfth to his
[1:31:42] disciples and says will you leave me
[1:31:44] also they will the multitudes were
[1:31:48] leaving because of worldly wisdom but
[1:31:51] these others had a Heavenly wisdom and
[1:31:53] they said where would we go for thou
[1:31:55] Hast the words of eternal life brother
[1:31:58] random says they didn't know what he was
[1:32:00] talking about but they believed it
[1:32:03] they couldn't explain it but they
[1:32:05] believe it you might not be able to
[1:32:07] explain some things but your simple
[1:32:09] faith says I can't hope I believe it I
[1:32:12] can't help but believe it
[1:32:14] brother random says well thought you
[1:32:16] might say Dr Dr so and so doesn't
[1:32:19] believe it this way he says but that
[1:32:21] doesn't change God's word a bit
[1:32:23] that doesn't change God's word a bit
[1:32:25] they may walk away and says this is
[1:32:27] false but that still don't change the
[1:32:29] power of it he says you're not saved by
[1:32:31] education you're not saved by wisdom you
[1:32:34] are saved by faith
[1:32:36] this Faith as the musicians come
[1:32:39] it's faith that is going to get this
[1:32:42] this Earth in a redeemed condition like
[1:32:45] I said earlier it's Earthly wisdom that
[1:32:48] is destroying the Earth
[1:32:49] but it's the Heavenly wisdom that is
[1:32:51] going to redeem it
[1:32:53] you see it was worldly wisdom why many
[1:32:56] build boats in Noah's day but they all
[1:32:59] sank but it was a Heavenly wisdom that
[1:33:02] no one could ride the waves
[1:33:04] it was unhealthy wisdom the Cain's
[1:33:07] sacrificed sacrifice was refused but it
[1:33:11] was a Heavenly wisdom
[1:33:13] the Ables was accepted
[1:33:15] there's two wisdoms going on but there's
[1:33:18] a Heavenly wisdom that God is accepting
[1:33:21] the Tower of Babel was worldly wisdom
[1:33:24] trying to approach God built the Tower
[1:33:27] to reach the heavens
[1:33:29] but the approach of worldly wisdom can't
[1:33:31] reach God but it was by faith Enoch
[1:33:34] approached God
[1:33:36] he walked with God till God took him and
[1:33:40] the Bible says before he was translated
[1:33:43] he had this testimony that he pleased
[1:33:46] God
[1:33:46] what's the Bible say how do you please
[1:33:48] God by faith so how did he approach God
[1:33:51] by faith
[1:33:53] oh that's powerful friends it was by
[1:33:56] faith that he approached God the Tower
[1:33:59] of Babel was refused they was trying to
[1:34:02] get to heaven that was trying to reach
[1:34:04] God but God says now I'm refusing that
[1:34:06] wisdom but I'm giving you a wisdom and
[1:34:09] if you can approach it if you can have a
[1:34:12] testimony of faith
[1:34:14] you can approach me you can step up into
[1:34:18] this other atmosphere and I say that
[1:34:20] this morning the only way to approach
[1:34:22] this message is by faith you can't
[1:34:25] approach it by denominational wisdoms
[1:34:28] you can't approach it a theology wisdoms
[1:34:31] you can approach it by worldly wisdoms
[1:34:34] the only way you can approach this
[1:34:36] message is by faith
[1:34:38] the only way to approach God Is by faith
[1:34:42] brother Branham says this one more quote
[1:34:44] we're going 1600 miles of an hour today

[1:34:50] eating off this tree of knowledge and
[1:34:52] we're over here the preachers oh the
