[6:09] If you believe you're in his presence,
[6:12] why don't you praise him? I would rather

[6:21] satisfy.
[6:23] Amen. But Jesus has satisfied my soul.
[6:26] Amen. I can't thank him enough. Amen.
[6:29] Amen. He put a place in the human heart
[6:32] that only he can dwell. And people try
[6:35] to fill it with everything that this
[6:37] world has to offer. Amen. But it will
[6:40] never last. Amen. Jesus is the only
[6:44] thing that is eternal. Amen. And I've
[6:46] come to praise my my king and lord and
[6:50] savior for all that he is and all that

[27:02] A guilt that lived in my past.
[27:11] Bound up in shackles of all my failures.
[27:23] Wondering
[27:25] how long is this going to last?
[27:33] Then you look at this prisoner and say
[27:36] to me, "Son, stop fighting a fight
[27:41] that's already been won.
[27:46] I am redeemed.
[27:51] You set me free.
[27:57] So I will shake off these heavy chains.
[28:01] You wiped away every stain. I'm not who
[28:05] I used to be.
[28:08] I am redeemed.
[28:14] Oh my
[28:17] life. I have felt unworthy.
[28:25] named by the voice of my shame and
[28:31] regret.
[28:35] But then I hear you whisper, "Child,
[28:38] lift up your head." Now remember, oh
[28:42] God, you're not done with me yet.
[28:48] I am redeemed.
[28:53] I've been set free.
[28:59] So I will shake off this heavy chain.

[29:16] Oh my
[29:19] life. I have felt so unworthy
[29:28] by the voice of my shame and regret.
[29:37] But then I hear you whisper, "Child,
[29:40] lift up your head." Now remember, oh
[29:44] God, you're not done with me yet.
[29:50] I am redeemed.
[29:55] You set me free.
[30:01] So I will shake off these heavy chains.
[30:04] Wiped away every stain. I'm not who I
[30:09] used to be.
[30:11] No, I don't have to be the old man
[30:15] that's inside me. His day is long dead
[30:20] and gone.
[30:23] I have a new name, a new life. I am not
[30:26] the same. And hope that will carry me
[30:30] home.
[30:34] I am redeemed.
[30:39] You set me free.
[30:45] So I will shake off these heavy chains.
[30:48] You wiped away every stain. I'm not who
[30:52] I used to be.
[30:55] Oh no, I'm not who I used to be.

[31:24] Amen. Would you stand with me?
[31:29] Christianity
[31:31] is not a new leaf. It's a changed life.
[31:34] It's a new birth.
[31:37] Because that's the only thing God will
[31:38] accept.
[31:41] won't accept our righteousness as his
[31:43] filthy rags.
[31:47] How many mean he wants him to search
[31:48] your life this morning?
[31:52] You know, people think that they're
[31:54] they're the ones that decide what's
[31:56] right and wrong.
[31:58] We're not here to examine the word of
[32:01] God's per se, whether it's right or not,
[32:05] but we're to be examined by the word of
[32:07] God
[32:09] to see to see if we're right or not.
[32:14] No wonder the Bible says the word of God
[32:16] is quick and powerful, sharper than any
[32:19] two-edged sword, uh, dividing us under
[32:23] the soul and the spirit, and the joints
[32:24] and the mar. And that is a a discerner
[32:27] of the thoughts and intents of the
[32:29] heart.
[32:31] How many wants him to search your heart?
[32:33] I want him to search my heart this
[32:35] morning. Take out all the leaven, all
[32:37] the unbelief.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; For I was an unbeliever one time. Had
[32:43] many sins because of that unbelief.
[32:46] But when he changed me, I could no
[32:49] longer disbelieve the word of God. For
[32:52] it's a sin to disbelieve.
[32:55] And it's not up for debate.
[32:58] He sent the truth. He said, "I am the
[33:00] way. I am the truth. I'm what's right.
[33:03] I'm the life. And I'll give it to you if
[33:06] you want it, Brother Joe.
[33:09] I got it. Did you get it, Brother Joe?
[33:12] &gt;&gt; And it'll last.
[33:15] Amen. It'll keep you. Amen. It's eternal
[33:18] life. Amen. How many is ready for the
[33:21] word of God this morning? He's going to
[33:22] get behind brother Michael. Amen. He's
[33:25] going to preach the word. HE'S GOD
[33:27] CALLED AND GOD CHOSEN. AMEN. We're all
[33:31] in one mind and one accord. God's going
[33:33] to do something this morning if you can
[33:35] believe it. And you're under expectation
[33:37] this morning. Amen. Let's just sing the
[33:41] that little chorus and D. Lord, prepare
[33:43] me to be a sanctuary. Amen. Lord prepare
[33:49] me
[33:52] to be your sainty.
[34:00] Oh, pure and holy.
[34:08] Oh, tried
[34:10] and true.
[34:16] With thanksgiving.
[34:20] I'll be a willing
[34:23] sanctuary
[34:25] of living.
[34:30] Oh, saint.
[34:37] Should we go up?
[34:41] Oh, just sing it with all your heart
[34:42] now.
[34:44] Oh Lord,
[34:47] prepare
[34:48] me. It's a dying out to be a sanctuary.
[34:57] The old man is dead.
[35:00] Pure and holy
[35:07] and tried and true.
[35:12] With thanksgiving
[35:14] and with thanksgiving
[35:20] I'll be a livinging.
[35:28] Oh, saint to wear
[35:35] for
[35:37] you. As the man of God gets ready to
[35:40] come, just sing it again. And Lord,
[35:44] prepare,
[35:46] oh, with prayer and supplication.
[35:50] Oh, with thanksgiving, let your requests
[35:53] be made known unto God.
[35:56] Oh, and he'll grant it this morning.
[35:57] Pure and holy
[36:04] and shrine and true.
[36:10] Oh, with
[36:12] thanksgiving.
[36:25] Thank you.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] You love him here this morning.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Is that your desires to be a living
[36:49] sanctuary for the Lord?
[36:51] Amen. I believe that it's important for
[36:54] the day that we live in is to be a
[36:56] tabernacle, a place where God can dwell
[36:58] and he can feel comfortable
[37:01] and um certainly enjoyed the songs here
[37:04] this morning and uh feel the presence of
[37:08] the Lord with us and uh you know there's
[37:12] just something about his presence. You
[37:14] can't see him
[37:17] technically, physically as of right now.
[37:19] You can't touch him, but yet you can
[37:22] feel him.
[37:23] I've often said in times that, you know,
[37:27] his presence is like, and only way that
[37:29] I can describe it in my way of of
[37:33] putting it together is it's like a
[37:35] transformer.
[37:37] You know, when you go next to those big
[37:39] green transformers,
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; you can't see the electricity.
[37:45] You definitely don't want to touch it.
[37:49] But inside that transformer, you put
[37:51] your ear up close to you can hear it
[37:52] humming. It's there. And that's the way
[37:56] I feel here here this evening. His
[37:58] presence is here. Amen. Just the humming
[38:00] and beaming through the people. And just
[38:02] good to see everybody in the house of
[38:05] the Lord. And good to see all those that
[38:07] are come to serve him. And and uh
[38:11] that'll be good for the musicians here
[38:13] this or this morning. But uh
[38:17] just good to be in the house of the Lord
[38:19] and good to see everybody and um you
[38:23] know
[38:26] just been kind of enjoying some of this
[38:30] fall weather that we've been getting
[38:32] here here lately. It's a little warm
[38:35] outside, you know, but uh you know the
[38:38] trees are all turning and everything and
[38:40] I'm actually getting to enjoy it.
[38:41] Usually it's just all happens pretty
[38:43] quick. You know, just bang bang, all the
[38:45] trees and all the leaves are all falling
[38:47] and uh you know, it gets cold and frost
[38:49] is on the ground and and uh but it's
[38:52] just good to see God and nature just to
[38:55] see everything come together the way
[38:56] that he plans it and u brother Window
[38:59] wanted me to make sure to tell everybody
[39:01] hello and uh and uh that he loves
[39:05] everybody and that he's just going to be
[39:08] back as quick as he can. and uh he went
[39:11] up to Virginia there to be with brother
[39:13] Sha. Um but if we could, we'd like to go
[39:16] ahead and move into our scriptures here
[39:18] this morning there in second Kings
[39:21] starting the fifth in the fifth chapter.
[39:23] And I'm going to just read a portion of
[39:25] it and have you guys be seated. Um,
[39:30] pretty familiar passage of scripture
[39:32] here, but hopefully that it would be a
[39:34] blessing
[39:38] and uh, you know, I
[39:42] been trying to do a lot of hunting here
[39:44] lately, so my mind kind of gets stuck in
[39:49] that little frame of mind there. So, if
[39:51] you get a lot of hunting analogies or
[39:53] stuff like that, that's just that's just
[39:55] coming. Honestly, it's just the way it's
[39:57] just happening, you know? So, that's
[39:59] just my process. Everything's kind of
[40:02] funneling that way at the moment. But,
[40:05] uh, but anyway, so, but there in the
[40:07] fifth chapter of 2 Kings, it reads like
[40:09] this. It says,
[40:11] "Now Non, the captain of the hosts of
[40:14] the king of Syria, was a great man with
[40:17] his master and honorable because by him
[40:20] the Lord had given deliverance unto
[40:22] Syria. He was also a mighty man
[40:27] in in valor, but he was a leper.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could just bow our hearts as
[40:33] we go to the Lord here this this
[40:35] morning. Heavenly Father, we just love
[40:36] you.
[40:38] Father, we just need you here this
[40:39] morning. We would just ask, Lord, that
[40:41] you would just help us, Lord, to be able
[40:44] to say what you would want us to say,
[40:46] Lord. Just take away the things that are
[40:47] not. Father, I would just ask that you
[40:50] would just be with your people, Lord.
[40:52] strengthen them, encourage them. Father,
[40:54] I would just ask that you would just
[40:55] take this thought, these words, Lord,
[40:57] these things, and just Lord, put them
[41:00] together. We just do this for your glory
[41:02] in Jesus name. Amen. You could be seated
[41:05] here this morning.
[41:07] And so, um, but reading, I'm going to
[41:11] continue reading here. Start here in the
[41:12] second the second verse. And it reads,
[41:15] "Thus, and the Syrians had gone out by
[41:18] the companies, and had brought away
[41:20] captives out of the land of Israel, a
[41:24] little maid. And when she was waited on
[41:28] non's wife, and she said unto her
[41:30] mistress, would God, my lord, were with
[41:33] the prophet that is in Samaria,
[41:37] &gt;&gt; for he would recover him of his
[41:39] leprosy."
[41:41] And one went out and told his lord,
[41:42] saying, "Thus, and thus the maid that is
[41:45] of the land of Israel." And the king of
[41:47] Syria said, "Go, go, and I will send a
[41:51] letter into unto the king of Israel."
[41:53] And he departed. And he took with him 10
[41:55] talents of silver and 6,000 pieces of
[41:58] gold, and 10 changes of raignment. And
[42:01] he brought the letter to the king of
[42:03] Israel, saying,"Now, when this letter
[42:06] has come unto thee, behold, I have
[42:09] wherewith sent non my servant to thee,
[42:13] that thou mayest recover him of his
[42:15] leprosy." Now, this next portion or this
[42:18] next verse here, I'd like for us to just
[42:20] take a little send unto me to recover a
[42:23] man of his leprosy. Wherefore consider I
[42:26] pray you and see how he seeketh a
[42:30] quarrel against me. Now looking at this
[42:33] little portion this little portion of
[42:35] scripture right here. Now he had sent
[42:37] non first to the king and asked that he
[42:40] would first be that the king would do
[42:42] something to heal non uh this great
[42:45] general of his leprosy. But immediately
[42:47] the king realized his limitations. Now
[42:51] looking at this, this is something that
[42:52] I look at that governments doesn't have
[42:54] the ability to do anything that God can
[42:57] do. And this king recognized his ability
[43:00] even to the point where he had at the
[43:02] end of that scripture, he was like, has
[43:04] he set this up as some kind of a trick
[43:07] &gt;&gt; that that we that he could start a
[43:08] fight, start a fight between me and
[43:10] Israel. But I'd like for you I'd like
[43:13] for us to to continue on here there in
[43:15] the eth verse. And he said and he said
[43:17] it was so. When Elisha, the man of God,
[43:20] had heard the king of Israel, he had
[43:22] rent his clothes, that he had rent his
[43:24] clothes that he had sent to the king,
[43:27] saying, "Wherefore hast thou rent thy
[43:29] clothes? Let him come now to me, and he
[43:32] shall know that there is a prophet in
[43:35] Israel." So therefore, now we have the
[43:37] word responding to the challenge here.
[43:40] So now, so non came with his horses and
[43:42] with his chariots, and he stood at the
[43:44] door of the house of Elijah. And Elijah
[43:46] sent his messenger unto him, saying, "Go
[43:49] and wash in the Jordan seven times, and
[43:51] thy flesh shall come unto thee, or come
[43:55] again unto thee, and thou shalt be
[43:56] clean." But non was wroth. Now think
[43:59] about this. Now non has leprosy. Non has
[44:03] been treated multiple times. Has been no
[44:05] doubt that there was plenty of
[44:07] physicians that were there in Syria. But
[44:09] leprosy was a case that was unccurable.
[44:12] Therefore, you know the non was non was
[44:15] having a problem here. He says and but
[44:17] non withdraws and he went away and said
[44:19] behold I thought he would surely come
[44:22] out to me and stand and call on the name
[44:25] of the Lord his God and strike his hand
[44:28] over the place and recover the leopard.
[44:30] Now again looking at this there we go
[44:33] back to the 11th chap or the 11th verse
[44:35] the verse that's directly before that.
[44:37] But non with ro was wroth and he went
[44:39] away. And behold, I thought now the word
[44:41] had already given him the command of
[44:43] what to do in order for his for his
[44:45] leprosy to be done. But yet non walks
[44:48] out of away from the word and he was
[44:50] just like but I thought that this is
[44:51] what what was going to happen. You know,
[44:53] I thought this is what was going to what
[44:55] was going to what was going to take
[44:56] place. You know, I thought I was going
[44:58] to be able to come. We were going to
[44:59] throw some gold out. We're going to
[45:00] throw some silver. we're going to be,
[45:02] hey, you know, here's some shirts and
[45:03] here's some new pair of Nikes and, you
[45:05] know, I'm going to come and I'm going to
[45:06] get my healing, you know, and then all
[45:07] of a sudden he comes to the king and the
[45:09] king's like, whoa, this is out of my
[45:11] league. This is this is this is a this
[45:14] is a situation here that that I'm not
[45:16] fit to do now. Now, now non again, he
[45:19] has leprosy and and this is a serious
[45:21] situation because his flesh is literally
[45:24] rotting off of his body. So now non is
[45:27] he's in a situation when he was like,
[45:29] "Well, where do I go?" And they're like
[45:30] they're like uh the and the prophet
[45:32] hears the situation and he was like I
[45:34] want you to go I want you to go wash I I
[45:37] want you to go wash in the I want you to
[45:39] go wash in the river. And he of course
[45:42] he's upset and he says here in the 12th
[45:44] verse he says are not are not Abna and
[45:46] the and the and the parrah rivers of
[45:49] Damascus better than the waters of
[45:51] Israel? May I not wash in them and be
[45:54] clean? So he turned away and and and he
[45:56] was enraged. Now, now the now when he
[46:00] was now looking at this uh but he had
[46:02] told it to him to go and wash and the
[46:04] rivers in the rivers in Jerusalem
[46:06] weren't necessarily the most cleanest
[46:08] rivers that was there. And so now he's
[46:10] looking at the situation and and and
[46:12] he's needing to be cleansed of this
[46:14] leprosy. He's needing to be he's needed
[46:16] to be rided to be rid of it. And the
[46:19] prophet tells him, I want you to go wash
[46:20] in this river. But yet but yet he he he
[46:23] wants to do it his own way. He's got his
[46:25] own idea about how to do things. And he
[46:27] says here, "And a servant came near, and
[46:29] he spake to him, and he said, "My
[46:30] father, if the prophet had bid thee to
[46:33] do some great thing, would thou not have
[46:36] done it? How much more rather when he
[46:39] say, wash, wash and be clean?" Yeah.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. So now you got this same servant
[46:44] girl that's in the third verse that had
[46:46] was the one that had recognized that
[46:48] there was a healer recognized that the
[46:50] word was in the land and had first had
[46:53] convinced non and the servants and the
[46:55] different ones to be able to go over to
[46:57] Israel. And now you got this same
[46:59] servant girl that's coming back and is
[47:01] speaking to non and he's sitting there
[47:03] and he's telling them, you know,
[47:06] if he would asked you to have done
[47:08] anything else, would you have done it?
[47:09] And he's like, well, yeah, of course. So
[47:11] then what's the problem? What what's the
[47:13] situation here? So naban again we go
[47:15] down here and we read and he went down
[47:17] and he dipped himself seven times in
[47:19] Jordan according to uh according to the
[47:22] saying of the man of God and his flesh
[47:24] had came again like unto the flesh of a
[47:27] little child and he was clean and he had
[47:29] returned to the he returned to the man
[47:31] of God and all his company and came and
[47:34] stood before him and he said behold now
[47:37] I know that there is no God in all the
[47:40] earth but in Israel. Now therefore, I
[47:43] pray thee, take a a blessing of thy
[47:46] servant. But he said, as the Lord liveth
[47:49] before whom I stand, I will receive I
[47:53] will receive none. And he urged him to
[47:55] take it, but he refused. Now, now
[47:57] thinking of this little uh thinking
[47:59] about this little story here, right
[48:01] here, I begin to think about a washing
[48:03] or or a cleansing and and sometimes as a
[48:06] minister, you know, you begin to try and
[48:08] some and and song leaders and different
[48:10] ones, you know, that are that you you're
[48:12] looking there's certain things that are
[48:13] said, there's certain things that that
[48:15] happen in your daily life that you begin
[48:17] to pick out things and and then you
[48:19] begin to build certain things together.
[48:21] And I begin to I begin to hear
[48:23] throughout the past few weeks throughout
[48:25] the sermons and through some of the
[48:26] songs talking about a renewing and a
[48:29] washing and and uh how many think that
[48:31] thinks that that's okay, you know? I
[48:33] mean, there's nothing wrong with the
[48:34] with a washing and and I I hope you're
[48:37] not against washing, you know. I hope
[48:38] you wash, you know. I mean, I hope I
[48:40] hope that you're you're just not, you
[48:42] know, just making me think that you're
[48:44] okay with, you know, just nice and
[48:46] dressed up. But but thinking about this,
[48:48] I begin to think about how that
[48:49] everything requires some type of a
[48:51] renewing or a washing or anything
[48:54] materialistic. You know, if you think
[48:56] about, you know, a gun or you think
[48:58] about, you know, how that sometimes
[49:00] that, you know, if you buy a gun at the
[49:02] beginning, you know, it comes fully
[49:03] prepared, it comes fully uh equipped. It
[49:06] might need a few little things here and
[49:07] there, but it's just out of the box, you
[49:09] know, without the scope ready to go, you
[49:11] know, and but over time after you begin
[49:13] to use the use your rifle and you begin
[49:16] to uh I told you this, you're going to
[49:18] get some hunting stuff, you know, it's
[49:19] just it's just going to happen, you
[49:20] know. So, so after after a period of
[49:23] time, you're going to you're going to
[49:24] get, you know, your rifle uh you're
[49:26] going to be carrying it through the
[49:27] woods and you're going to get water in
[49:29] it or or you know, heaven forbid
[49:31] somebody stick the barrel down into the
[49:33] mud, you know, or or you know, or you're
[49:35] going to get your scope knocked off and
[49:37] it or something like that and and it rec
[49:40] it requires a for a little bit of
[49:42] maintenance work to be done to it. It
[49:44] requires you to put oils in it and it
[49:47] requires you to, you know, clean off the
[49:49] rust and be able to sight the scope back
[49:51] in. You know what, you know, and you
[49:53] begin to think about how that sometimes
[49:56] uh in life, you know, that people say
[49:57] that, you know, they need a need to get
[50:00] away from life and you need to get away
[50:02] from the work situation. You need to get
[50:04] away from just the daily grind. And you
[50:06] know, everybody's seeking a vacation or
[50:08] they're seeking a place where they can
[50:10] get renewed or they can get re re uh
[50:12] washed or they can just come back
[50:14] refreshed and come back, you know, just
[50:16] ready to ready to hit the grind, you
[50:18] know, and and and you know, and I begin
[50:20] to think about how that, you know, uh
[50:22] thinking about this, I begin to think
[50:24] about how that Robert and uh he has this
[50:26] little detailing thing going on, you
[50:28] know, and and how that, you know,
[50:30] detailing cars that there's certain
[50:32] things, you know, I when I'd come to him
[50:34] one time about detailing in a vehicle,
[50:35] you know, I was like, "Oh, I'm just
[50:37] going to get the rag, you know, and put
[50:38] some water on it and get some snow or
[50:40] get some get some soap and I'm just
[50:42] going to come out and I'm just going to
[50:43] start washing." He's like, "Stop what
[50:45] you're doing." And I'm just like, "Why?"
[50:47] He said, "No, there's a process and
[50:48] there's a you know, in order to get this
[50:51] in order to get the deposits off of the
[50:53] the paint of the car, you're going to
[50:55] have to use a certain thing that comes
[50:57] and and takes off all the takes off all
[51:00] the debris off the top of it. Otherwise,
[51:02] you're just going to take your rag and
[51:03] just scratch all over the top of it, you
[51:06] know, and and without that kind of a
[51:07] knowledge, I would have never known that
[51:09] there's a process that goes. I just go
[51:11] to the old car wash, you know, and put
[51:13] my car in and I just spray it down with
[51:15] some white stuff and, you know, power
[51:17] wash it off. And really, the cleaning
[51:19] for me is the actual power washing. It's
[51:21] not the soap, you know, it's just a, you
[51:22] know, you're really just trying to blow
[51:24] off all the dirt that's on it, you know,
[51:26] and and and you know, but but there's a
[51:28] process of these things that that that
[51:29] that happens, you know, and and you
[51:32] know, to begin to think about how that
[51:33] there's also a washing and a
[51:35] rejuvenating or renewing that takes
[51:37] place in the life of the believer that,
[51:39] you know, God's just not some God's just
[51:42] not some, you know, car wash that we can
[51:44] just go to and we just walk into church
[51:46] and we're just like, God, do your thing,
[51:48] you know, and and all of a sudden you
[51:50] just You take a little twirl and you're
[51:52] just like, you know, put an extra wax on
[51:54] me because I got a lot of sin that I'm
[51:56] going to be going through in life, you
[51:57] know, and I need to, you know, and God's
[51:59] not that way. God's not God's just not
[52:01] just just a turn in and turn out type of
[52:04] believer, but but God has a certain way
[52:07] and God has a certain solution and God
[52:09] has the has a he he deals with every
[52:12] individ or he deals with every person
[52:14] individually. You know, that that not
[52:17] every person that comes to church, you
[52:19] know, battles the same things that I do.
[52:21] And uh you know, I don't struggle with
[52:23] the things that brother Mike does. You
[52:25] know, brother Mike just seems to live
[52:26] just a a perfect peaceful life. you
[52:29] know, he's just never mad, you know,
[52:30] he's just, you know, he he just like,
[52:32] well, you know, he's, you know, he's
[52:34] laidback and, you know, but and then you
[52:36] got the other person on the other side
[52:38] that's just going to 100 to zero to this
[52:42] to that, you know, that's mad, that's
[52:43] happy, that's you know, and and you you
[52:46] know, God got God's got there's
[52:48] different personalities and God's gave
[52:50] us God made made a lot of people with
[52:52] different varieties of personalities.
[52:55] Therefore, he deals with people there
[52:57] there some people require just a little
[52:59] bit more grace than this person does or
[53:01] this one requires just a little bit more
[53:03] love than but we go through life and and
[53:05] and we come through Christianity and we
[53:08] start on the way of course you know we
[53:10] we come out and and and we're looking
[53:13] and and we're seeking because there's
[53:15] something that's within us that doesn't
[53:17] seem to set right and and and we hear
[53:19] the gospel and the gospel has a a
[53:22] drawing power first there's nobody body
[53:24] that comes to God unless God first draws
[53:27] him. And there's nobody that's in this
[53:29] building that's that's here here this
[53:31] morning that that comes on their own
[53:32] accord. You just didn't decide, oh, I'm
[53:34] just going to go to a church. I mean,
[53:36] who would do that? Who would just stop
[53:37] the beginning of the day and just, oh,
[53:39] I'm going to go to church when you COULD
[53:40] GO TO A basketball game or you could go
[53:43] you could go hunting or you could go
[53:45] Yeah, there I go. you know, or you could
[53:47] go you could go hunting or that you
[53:49] could go play baseball or you could
[53:50] watch a movie or, you know, but yet
[53:52] there's something that's drawing you uh
[53:54] to his service. There's drawing you to
[53:57] the word of God. It's drawing you to the
[53:59] to the songs that are being sung. It's
[54:01] not your family. It's not it's not, you
[54:04] know, just to be dressed up or anything
[54:06] like that, but it's the spirit of God
[54:08] that's coming and he's drawing you. And
[54:10] what he does is sometimes is he draws us
[54:12] into his presence and he draws us into
[54:15] this word. But you know I you know I put
[54:17] on my pants just the way you do. You
[54:19] know I you know I just had to go out and
[54:21] jump my truck just you know just the
[54:23] same way that you do. And you know what
[54:25] we walk through this life and we get
[54:27] soot and we do deal with drama and we
[54:29] deal with Amen. the the aches and the
[54:31] pains of life and having to having to
[54:34] provide for a family or happening to,
[54:37] you know, to deal with your children and
[54:39] teach school and to do these different
[54:40] things. throughout this world, we begin
[54:43] to go through the grind and and you know
[54:44] what, we begin to get dirt and and you
[54:46] know what? The other day I was working
[54:48] on a a little rental property down the
[54:50] road here and and I got the I got a
[54:52] table saw, you know, and this table saw
[54:54] that this thing just rip right through
[54:55] anything and it's just done such a great
[54:58] job this past couple years that we've
[55:00] had it. But one day I was having a
[55:02] problem with the slide and I couldn't
[55:04] get the slide to go back and forth and I
[55:06] was just like I thought I had it locked,
[55:08] you know, so I'd unlock it and I'd lock
[55:10] it and and I twist it and I'd just go
[55:11] back and forth and I begin to think,
[55:13] well, what's wrong with this thing that,
[55:15] you know, the thing spins and it does
[55:16] this and it does that. But what had
[55:18] happened was is that all of the sawdust
[55:21] and all of the dirt and all the things
[55:23] had gotten down into the rails and it
[55:26] caused the and it caused the slide to be
[55:28] able to not go back and forth. And so I
[55:30] had to be able I had to get my little
[55:32] tool out and I had to kind of scrape out
[55:34] the slides in order to in order for the
[55:36] uh scrape out the rails in order for the
[55:38] slides to get there, you know, and and I
[55:40] begin to think about how that sometimes,
[55:42] you know, God doesn't God is wondering
[55:45] what's going on with this person or or
[55:47] what's going on with that person, you
[55:49] know, they they come to church and they
[55:51] seek me and they sing and they, you
[55:53] know, and that they preach and they, you
[55:55] know, and they read their Bible and they
[55:58] do all these different things But yet
[56:00] they're not operating the way that I
[56:01] made them. You know, I made this person
[56:03] to be a prayer warrior. I made this
[56:05] person to be a singer and I made this
[56:07] person to, you know, to be able to
[56:09] preach the gospel and made this one to
[56:11] do this or to do that. But yet when I go
[56:13] to operate them, things seem to be
[56:15] getting in the way. And and I begin to
[56:17] think about that's how it is. And in our
[56:19] walk with God is sometimes, hey man,
[56:22] we're the equipment God needs. We're
[56:24] exactly what he needs in the area that
[56:26] we are. But we get things in our rails
[56:28] and we get things in the way that WHEN
[56:30] WHEN GOD BEGINS TO COME AND and he's
[56:32] ready to be able to use us for HIS GLORY
[56:34] THAT HE goes up to do something and he
[56:37] can't he can't do it because you're
[56:39] stuck and you got things in the WAY AND
[56:41] AND GOD can't do anything about it, you
[56:43] know. And so, you know, and that's the
[56:45] way it is with tools, you know.
[56:47] Sometimes you you got to get out the old
[56:49] WD40 and you go down to spraying all the
[56:52] things that are rusted out and and all
[56:54] the things that are locked UP AND AND
[56:56] YOU AND and you get to a place where you
[56:58] get to A PLACE WHERE YOU'RE NOT USABLE.
[57:02] You get to a place where WHERE GOD GETS
[57:04] OUT AND GETS READY TO DO SOMETHING IN
[57:06] SOMEBODY'S LIFE, but he wants to use
[57:08] you, but he can't use YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
[57:10] LOCKED UP IN EDUCATION
[57:12] &gt;&gt; or you're locked up in WORK OR YOU'RE
[57:14] LOCKED UP IN HATRED OR YOU'RE LOCKED UP
[57:16] IN IN YOUR YOUR FAMILY SITUATION OR
[57:19] YOU'RE LOCKED UP IN THIS. AMEN. AND
[57:20] GOD'S KINGDOM IS TRYING TO GET DONE.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; God's trying to get this done so you can
[57:26] make A RAPTURE, BUT HE'S WAITING FOR YOU
[57:27] TO GET THE SAWDUST OUT OF YOUR RAILS.
[57:30] He's ready for you to get the rust out
[57:32] of the nonsense out of your mind. And
[57:34] he's ready FOR YOU TO GET ALL THESE
[57:35] THINGS, AMEN, TO A place where he could
[57:37] use you to where he could DO HIS WILL
[57:39] RIGHT HERE IN
[57:40] &gt;&gt; PANEE.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go through life and we're
[57:45] just sailing away, you know, we're just
[57:47] sailing away, you know, and then all of
[57:49] a sudden we don't realize that we're
[57:50] just dragging behind. We don't realize
[57:53] that, hey, you know what? there's a work
[57:55] going on and how come the sails you know
[57:57] I got the sails I got the ship and you
[57:59] know and I got all the people that are
[58:01] there and and and but you know what the
[58:03] ships sometimes they have to beach
[58:06] &gt;&gt; sometimes them ships they got to beach
[58:07] in order to get all the things that are
[58:09] hanging on them off
[58:12] &gt;&gt; you know I was just listening about you
[58:14] know I like running numbers and I was
[58:15] just I don't know why I was just looking
[58:17] at this thing about people that clean
[58:19] ships and just randomly things like
[58:22] knowledge I consume
[58:24] you know, just random knowledge, you
[58:26] know, that, you know, so just random
[58:28] knowledge. I just randomly begin to look
[58:30] onto this thing and then I begin to see
[58:32] about how these guys, you know, getting
[58:33] paid big bucks to be able to, you know,
[58:35] just scrape off all the stuff that the
[58:37] ships that the ships that are stuck to
[58:39] them cuz all these things and what it
[58:40] does is it calls drag.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; And what it does is it makes it less
[58:44] aerodynamic. So the ships can't be able
[58:47] to get to a certain place because
[58:48] they've got it calculated. Amen. That
[58:50] the ships is aerodynamic like this. The
[58:52] motor is like this, the fuel is like
[58:54] that, the electronics is like this, and
[58:55] the sails are doing that. Amen. They're
[58:58] going at this certain distance, at this,
[59:00] you know, wind speed, blah, blah, blah,
[59:01] etc., etc. You should be able to make it
[59:03] to here at this place. And you know
[59:04] what? God's got his date set. God knows
[59:07] when the rapture's taking place. God
[59:08] knows when God knows when you're going
[59:10] to be healed of your bodies or the
[59:12] situation that's going on in your body.
[59:14] God knows when your sons and your
[59:15] daughters are going to come back to the
[59:16] Lord. And he knows when all these things
[59:18] are done. But yet, you got barnacles
[59:20] hanging on your ship. Amen. And you're
[59:22] SLOWING DOWN. YOU'RE DRAGGING GOD'S
[59:24] PLAN.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; My
[59:27] &gt;&gt; dragging.
[59:29] YOU'RE DRAGGING God's plan. You got the
[59:31] barnacles hanging at the bottom OF THE
[59:32] SHIP. OH YEAH. YOU'RE A BELIEVER.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going pull us out of here in just a
[59:37] second. I'm going pull us out of here
[59:40] for a second. Amen. Yeah. You're a
[59:41] believer. Yeah. Yeah. You you you got
[59:44] the ship. You got the sales. You got the
[59:46] mechanics. You got all these things. You
[59:48] you BELIEVE THE BIBLE. YOU GOT THE
[59:50] MESSAGE. You believe that God sent a
[59:51] prophet, but yet YOU'RE HANGING ON ALL
[59:53] THE BAGGAGE OF THIS WORLD. Claiming that
[59:56] there's going to be a rapture, CLAIMING
[59:58] THAT YOU'RE A MESSAGE BELIEVER, CLAIMING
[1:00:00] THAT YOU BELIEVE the word of God. AND
[1:00:02] YOU GOT ALL THIS BAGGAGE THAT'S HANGING
[1:00:04] YOU DOWN, THAT'S keeping you from
[1:00:05] church, that's keeping you from singing,
[1:00:07] that's keeping you from praying, that's
[1:00:09] keeping you from playing music, that's
[1:00:11] keeping you from preaching, that's
[1:00:13] keeping you a keeping you from the
[1:00:15] THINGS OF GOD. AND GOD'S LIKE, I'M
[1:00:17] TRYING TO SAIL ON.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. I need you to clean your
[1:00:21] rails. I NEED YOU TO CLEAN OFF THE
[1:00:23] BARNACLES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP. I
[1:00:26] NEED YOU TO SIGHT IN YOUR SCOPE. I NEED
[1:00:28] YOU TO CLEAN OUT THE BARREL. I NEED YOU
[1:00:30] TO GET OUT. AMEN. BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE
[1:00:32] MIDDLE OF TRYING TO DO SOMETHING.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Some of you young people might be
[1:00:38] sitting there and be like, "Yeah." And
[1:00:39] you're sitting there putting it back. IT
[1:00:40] WAS DAVID THAT KILLED THE GIANT.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; A YOUNG BOY.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. IT WAS JOSIAH
[1:00:51] THAT WAS A young king
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; that ruled in the place there in Israel.
[1:00:58] Yes, sir.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you be you might be sitting
[1:01:00] back and you be looking that you know
[1:01:01] what you know what
[1:01:04] get to some quotes here
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; and you be sitting out there and you and
[1:01:11] now you're sitting there and you're
[1:01:12] thinking you're going on through life
[1:01:15] and the sad thing is is we realize
[1:01:17] what's going on but we refuse to do
[1:01:20] anything about it. Okay,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; we realize that we're not in the situ
[1:01:25] I'm not I'm not sitting here driving my
[1:01:28] stakes down or anything. You know,
[1:01:29] sometimes when you get up here, you got
[1:01:30] to preach at yourself. Otherwise, you
[1:01:32] can't preach by what you believe.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, sometimes, you know,
[1:01:36] sometimes, you know, we we sit back and
[1:01:37] we wondered, you know, that we sit back
[1:01:39] and and we're thinking, you know, God,
[1:01:40] that I realize what you called me as you
[1:01:43] I realize, but I I just can't seem to be
[1:01:45] able to shake some of these things that
[1:01:46] are in my life. You know, I I can't seem
[1:01:48] to be able to I can't seem to be able to
[1:01:51] to to be able to get up to speed to
[1:01:52] where I was. You know, I've been looking
[1:01:54] back in these I look back in the
[1:01:56] scriptures here and I look and this is
[1:01:59] one of my favorite passages of scripture
[1:02:01] there in Psalms because, you know,
[1:02:03] David's a king.
[1:02:05] David's the head of his game. He's the
[1:02:07] man. He's the boss. Everything goes
[1:02:09] through David. But yet, David, even as a
[1:02:12] king, realized when he was dragging
[1:02:14] anchor,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:02:17] Look what happened with Bash Bashibba.
[1:02:20] Look what happened to the different sins
[1:02:22] that was come that he had done. He and
[1:02:24] different things. But yet he comes to
[1:02:25] the point where he rent his clothes
[1:02:28] in the presence of God and ask for
[1:02:30] mercy. Look at the scriptures like one
[1:02:32] of these psalm there in Psalms 515 to12.
[1:02:35] Behold I was shapen in iniquity.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Shapen. You were molded. That's the way
[1:02:41] that you were born. No way around it.
[1:02:43] Ifs of buts. was the way that you were
[1:02:46] made. I was shapen in iniquity and in
[1:02:49] sin did my mother conceive me. Behold,
[1:02:52] thou desire truth in the inward parts.
[1:02:56] Not this.
[1:02:59] Not showing up with a suit and tie. Not
[1:03:02] showing up with credentials.
[1:03:04] Not showing up, well, I've been a
[1:03:05] missionary here and I was a preacher
[1:03:07] there and oh, I led this over here and
[1:03:10] was in this prayer meeting and I done
[1:03:12] this and I done that. No, not none of
[1:03:14] that drama. He says, "BUT HE DESIRES
[1:03:16] TRUTH IN THE INWARD PARTS."
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Because if you have truth IN THE INWARD,
[1:03:21] IT'LL SHOW OUTWARDLY.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to sit here and tell ME
[1:03:24] THAT YOU SIT OUT THE DOORS THAT YOU LOVE
[1:03:26] GOD. I'LL KNOW WEDNESDAY, SUNDAYS,
[1:03:28] MORNING, SUNDAY NIGHT, WHETHER YOU DO OR
[1:03:30] NOT.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And in the hidden parts, thou shalt make
[1:03:37] me to know thy wisdom. Purge me.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh,
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; he's not asking you to just Lord, JUST
[1:03:43] JUST JUST WIPE OFF MY EYES, LORD. Just
[1:03:46] clean my hands. Make sure I got a good
[1:03:48] suit. Make sure my make sure my shoes
[1:03:50] are okay, my belt's tied up. HE SAYS,
[1:03:52] "NO, PURGE ME, LORD.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Because I know that YOU CAN SEE PAST
[1:03:57] WHAT THIS IS." AND YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING
[1:03:59] ON HERE.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I KNOW, LORD, BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOU
[1:04:04] WORK. He says that. He said, "Purge me
[1:04:05] with his and I SHALL BE CLEAN. WASH ME
[1:04:08] AND I SHALL BE WHITER THAN SNOW. Make me
[1:04:12] to hear the joy and gladness.
[1:04:15] That's the things happens when things
[1:04:17] get in the way.
[1:04:19] Things don't seem to ring the same.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Make me to hear joy and gladness. Make
[1:04:25] me to hear, Amen. the word of the Lord
[1:04:27] when it's preached, not just being
[1:04:29] preached through this vessel. You could
[1:04:32] sit here and you can criticize this
[1:04:33] vessel all that you want. You could sit
[1:04:35] and you can criticize the pastor vessel.
[1:04:37] You can criticize the evangelist vessel.
[1:04:40] You can criticize Amen the song leader
[1:04:42] vessel. You can criticize criticize the
[1:04:44] s the singer's vessel and all those all
[1:04:46] those things that all those things that
[1:04:48] you like. Amen. But the thing is is that
[1:04:50] you're not hearing
[1:04:52] the joy of gladness
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; because your ears, your hearing, your
[1:04:57] mind, YOUR BODY, YOUR SOUL NEEDS TO BE
[1:04:59] WASHED SO YOU CAN HEAR the word, the
[1:05:02] message THAT'S BEING PREACHED BEHIND.
[1:05:04] AMEN. The words that the man saying,
[1:05:07] behind the song that the man's saying,
[1:05:09] behind behind the things that a brother
[1:05:11] is trying to speak to you, he wants you
[1:05:13] to hear the joy and gladness. Amen. And
[1:05:15] if you're not careful, the devil will
[1:05:16] keep you completely on the negative.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Every one of your life situations that
[1:05:23] you're going through, Satan likes to
[1:05:24] point out the negative. Point out the
[1:05:26] negative. Well, your s well, your son's
[1:05:29] this. Well, you got this infirmity in
[1:05:31] your body. Well, well, you can't sing.
[1:05:33] Well, you can't preach. Well, you can't
[1:05:34] dance. Well, you can't do this. And
[1:05:36] we're going to sit there and remind you
[1:05:37] of all the things that you've gone
[1:05:39] through in your life. you know, all the
[1:05:40] things that you all those things that
[1:05:42] you have done, all the things that you
[1:05:44] all the things that you're trying to put
[1:05:45] away and all. But let me tell you
[1:05:47] something.
[1:05:48] You know, the other day I was dealing
[1:05:50] with something like that myself. You
[1:05:51] know, I was sitting there. I'm thinking
[1:05:53] and Satan's just hammering on me. Just
[1:05:55] hammering.
[1:05:57] I'm not talking, you know, I'm talking
[1:05:59] just
[1:06:02] I don't even I ain't even done nothing.
[1:06:05] Just hammering on me. And I said, you
[1:06:06] know what? I was just like, you know
[1:06:08] what?
[1:06:09] you're right, but I can't be that big of
[1:06:12] a loser.
[1:06:15] Some of my confidence kind of coming in
[1:06:16] there, you know, I like I'm a loser. I
[1:06:19] get that. I get that, but I can't be
[1:06:22] that big of a loser. You know, you say
[1:06:24] that I'm But you know what? You know
[1:06:26] what calls to my recollection of the
[1:06:30] fact that, you know, I think I remember
[1:06:34] when I've handed you some L's in your
[1:06:36] time. You know how many you know you
[1:06:39] know what I mean? I mean yeah we might
[1:06:40] have lo we might have lost some and we
[1:06:42] might have won some and but you know
[1:06:44] what I think that I think that what he
[1:06:46] does is he tries to put all this film
[1:06:48] over your mind and he tries to put all
[1:06:50] this film over your eyes to where a man
[1:06:53] he tries to blot out the times of of
[1:06:56] prayer where you defeated Satan. Amen.
[1:06:58] at your nighttime hour about the times
[1:07:01] that amen that you walked in and knew
[1:07:03] that amen situation was a was was
[1:07:06] impossible but yet you walked in and you
[1:07:09] handed the devil a loss amen in your
[1:07:12] spiritual life. You know what I think
[1:07:14] Satan has to be reminded of those kinds
[1:07:16] of things that and we need to COME
[1:07:18] THROUGH THE WASHING AMEN OF GOD'S WORD
[1:07:21] so we could be able those things could
[1:07:23] be cleansed OFF OF OUR MINDS AND and
[1:07:26] could BE CLEANSED THAT YOU'RE not a
[1:07:27] loser. Amen. You've already WON. AMEN.
[1:07:30] GOD'S ALREADY AMEN. TAKEN THE WORD OF
[1:07:32] GOD AND HE'S PLANTED THAT SEED IN YOUR
[1:07:34] HEART. YOU'VE ALREADY OVERCOME. AMEN.
[1:07:37] YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALREADY SAVED. AMEN.
[1:07:39] GOD'S ALREADY OVERCOME FOR YOU IN the
[1:07:41] situation YOU'RE GO THROUGH. ALL YOU GOT
[1:07:43] TO DO IS TAKE THE WORD.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Purge me with his sub. David says, HE
[1:07:48] SAYS, "HIDE thy face
[1:07:51] from my sins."
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Don't dodge it.
[1:07:58] Own it.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Own it.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, hide thy face from my sins. Put
[1:08:07] your halos away.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; HIDE
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; THY face from my sins.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; David's getting real.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; I know this is a familiar scripture, but
[1:08:24] this is just what it is. This is just
[1:08:26] one man talking real to God. He says,
[1:08:28] "Hi, hide my face from thy sins and blot
[1:08:31] out mine iniquities. Create in me a
[1:08:35] clean heart, oh God, and renew a right
[1:08:38] spirit within me. Cast me not away from
[1:08:42] thy presence,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:08:48] Restore
[1:08:50] unto me THE JOY OF MY SALVATION AND
[1:08:54] uphold me with thy free spirit. Restore
[1:08:59] unto me the joy OF MY SALVATION. THE
[1:09:01] PLACE WHERE I CAN COME WHERE I WOULD
[1:09:02] actually enjoy church. A place where I
[1:09:05] can come AND I CAN I CAN SHED OFF ALL
[1:09:08] THE PLACES OF THIS WORLD AND I can sit
[1:09:10] here and can concentrate on God and HIS
[1:09:12] GOODNESS. ONLY GOD renew a right spirit
[1:09:16] in me. Amen. that I could serve you in
[1:09:18] your word and in the trueness of heart.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[1:09:27] A washing,
[1:09:30] of course, has there's chemicals in the
[1:09:32] natural. There's all types of chemicals.
[1:09:35] You've got, you know, the the you've
[1:09:36] got, you know, the deep cleansing, you
[1:09:38] got the shine, you know, you've got a
[1:09:40] wax, you've got, you know, just all
[1:09:42] these kinds of I'm butchering all that
[1:09:44] up, but yet God has a cleansing agent as
[1:09:47] well.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; God has an ability to be able to do
[1:09:52] something that even he can't remember
[1:09:54] it.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; You think about that. Somebody that
[1:09:57] knows the end from the beginning.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Somebody that knows your
[1:10:02] future. Somebody that knows that you,
[1:10:04] some of you girls AS HUSBANDS, SOMEBODY
[1:10:07] THAT KNOWS, AMEN, YOU BOYS AS WIVES
[1:10:09] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, HE
[1:10:11] KNOWS EVERY misstep that you're going to
[1:10:13] take. BUT YET UNDERNEATH THAT ONE
[1:10:16] cleansing agent, he can't even remember
[1:10:18] your sins. THAT'S WHAT DAVID WAS LIKE,
[1:10:21] "HIDE,
[1:10:23] HIDE MY SINS, LORD." AND LET me tell you
[1:10:26] something, that sin, amen, can only be
[1:10:29] washed away. And even the remembrance of
[1:10:31] sin can only BE WASHED AWAY BY THE BLOOD
[1:10:34] OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. TO BE THAT WAS
[1:10:37] SHED ON CALVARY. AMEN. THAT COULD TAKE
[1:10:40] AWAY even the remembrance of sin.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to COME UNDERNEATH THE
[1:10:45] WASHING OF THAT WORD.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; THE WASHING OF THAT BLOOD.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; What was it? Say, Michael, is it the
[1:10:54] washing of the word or the blood?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; It was the word that produced the blood.
[1:11:00] It was the word that foretold of that
[1:11:02] precious lamb that was to come. And it
[1:11:06] was the word that sits HERE THAT STANDS
[1:11:08] RIGHT here this morning that says that
[1:11:10] you can be free to worship me and in
[1:11:13] spirit and in truth. Amen. It's that
[1:11:16] same cleansing agent.
[1:11:19] You say, "Is there another cleansing
[1:11:21] agent?" No.
[1:11:23] The blood is there to keep you.
[1:11:27] It's to cleanse you of sin.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; It's to take away the very remembrance
[1:11:34] from God's mind.
[1:11:36] But the thing is is we're going through
[1:11:37] life and and we get all the different
[1:11:40] things that are upon us and it begins to
[1:11:42] weigh us down and it begins to and it
[1:11:44] begins to weigh us down in the Lord and
[1:11:46] it begins to keep us, amen, from staying
[1:11:49] focused on his will and his purpose in
[1:11:51] our life. And yet we need to come back
[1:11:54] to that same cleansing agent. Amen. be
[1:11:57] able to come to a place now
[1:11:59] hunting.
[1:12:05] Told you,
[1:12:07] you know, two days ago I was shot me a
[1:12:11] deer,
[1:12:13] you know, and that deer had ran out and
[1:12:14] everything and it run it had ran it had
[1:12:17] ran down, you know, the field and
[1:12:21] and I could tell I I got a clean shot by
[1:12:24] the blood.
[1:12:26] Okay.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And the thing is is as long as I
[1:12:29] followed the trail,
[1:12:32] it would take me exactly to where the
[1:12:35] animal was.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; But along the trail, there was times
[1:12:39] where I got distracted
[1:12:42] because, you know, you're you're you're
[1:12:44] trying to find a dot,
[1:12:47] you know, on this limb over here,
[1:12:51] on this rock over here, on this dirt
[1:12:54] that's down right here. and you're
[1:12:56] trying to find this this this blood
[1:12:58] trail
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; on the ground. You're trying to find
[1:13:00] this blood trail because you're trying
[1:13:02] to get to the deer, you know. But the
[1:13:05] thing was is there was times that I'd
[1:13:08] find a good clean trail and I'd go and
[1:13:09] I'd go and all of a sudden I'd get out
[1:13:11] and I'd be like, "Where am I now?"
[1:13:15] I would have to go back to where the
[1:13:18] blood was
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; in order to restart my direction to in
[1:13:24] order to go. And sometimes we need to go
[1:13:27] back to the blood.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; To be able to restart our direction on
[1:13:32] our path with Christ.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to go back to the blood
[1:13:36] of Jesus and say, "You know what? You
[1:13:38] know what, God? I I've gone down this
[1:13:40] road and and you know what? I need you
[1:13:42] to wash me." Amen. from this from these
[1:13:44] these habits that I've accured. I NEED
[1:13:46] YOU TO WASH ME, AMEN, from these things
[1:13:49] that are coming onto my mind and you
[1:13:51] need to go back to the blood in order to
[1:13:54] trail it back to Christ. And you know
[1:13:56] what? Sometimes we begin to look even as
[1:13:58] the believer, we begin to sit and we
[1:14:00] begin to think about, you know, think
[1:14:02] about this. It's not just a washing from
[1:14:05] sin.
[1:14:08] Not just a washing from sin.
[1:14:12] You could stay at that level if you'd
[1:14:13] like.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; It's not just a washing of sin.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; But it's also a revealing of who you
[1:14:22] are.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz in order for you to see who you are,
[1:14:25] you had to have this washed.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT THIS. OKAY. SO, you have the
[1:14:31] man that was blind.
[1:14:33] Okay.
[1:14:34] He was blind and he come to Jesus and he
[1:14:37] asked for his sight and God the God God
[1:14:41] took he was the word and the man and he
[1:14:45] but he stepped back and he spit in the
[1:14:47] mud and he grabbed the mud and he and he
[1:14:51] put it in his hand and he made a paste
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; and he put it ON THE EYES OF THE man and
[1:14:56] he was like go and wash
[1:15:00] go and wash.
[1:15:02] Now, how putrid would that be?
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Going back to non situation.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Non's like, "I'm not washing in no dirty
[1:15:12] Jordan."
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, dirt water.
[1:15:18] But yet, he had an infirment. He had
[1:15:20] something that needed to get taken care
[1:15:21] of.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; But he was not going to be able to do it
[1:15:25] his way. He was going to have to do it
[1:15:27] THE WAY OF THE WORD.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; And you know what? When the man was
[1:15:31] coming up to be healed, the word said,
[1:15:33] "Here, here,
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; go and wash so you could be clean." And
[1:15:40] sometimes the word requires YOU TO COME
[1:15:42] UNDERNEATH A PASTOR.
[1:15:44] And sometimes the word requires you to
[1:15:46] come underneath, hey man, a minister or
[1:15:48] or requires you to come underneath an
[1:15:50] elder. Or the word will come off kind of
[1:15:53] a little bit, oh, that hurt. You or the
[1:15:55] word's GOING TO COME OFF, OH, I DON'T
[1:15:57] KNOW ABOUT THIS, OR OH, I DON'T KNOW
[1:15:58] ABOUT THAT. OR OR THE WORD'S going to
[1:16:00] come across a way THAT WE DON'T LIKE it
[1:16:02] because we're a teenager or we don't
[1:16:04] like it because we're an elder and we
[1:16:05] realize more than this or or we don't
[1:16:07] like IT BECAUSE WE'RE JUST YOUNG AND
[1:16:09] DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO LIKE OR NOT TO
[1:16:11] LIKE.
[1:16:16] But the word comes away and it has a
[1:16:18] certain process of being able to do
[1:16:20] something
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; and if you WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE
[1:16:24] KINGDOM OF GOD, you can't do things the
[1:16:27] way of the world. Remember, you got to
[1:16:30] think of the the washing as not just a
[1:16:32] cleansing but a revealing.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Look at this. Colossians 3:9 and 10
[1:16:38] there in Colossians starting at the
[1:16:40] ninth verse. Now, this is a good
[1:16:42] passage. This is a good passage of
[1:16:44] scripture. I would recommend that a lot
[1:16:46] of you just just read the whole context
[1:16:48] of this, the context of this, but we
[1:16:51] don't have time. So, we have to break
[1:16:52] into this. It says, "Lie not one to
[1:16:54] another, seeing that ye have put off the
[1:16:56] old man with his deeds and have put on
[1:16:58] the new man, which is renewed." Think,
[1:17:02] look at look at this. It's renewed in
[1:17:05] the knowledge after renewed in the
[1:17:08] knowledge. Now, look at this. a
[1:17:09] revealing, renewed in the knowledge,
[1:17:12] renewed that after the image of him that
[1:17:15] created him.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about a cleansing,
[1:17:20] we're talking about a cleaning, we're
[1:17:21] talking about we're talking ABOUT BUT
[1:17:22] YET IT'S ALSO a revealing to be renewed
[1:17:26] in the knowledge because being renewed
[1:17:28] in that knowledge, being renewed, being
[1:17:31] renewed in that revealing will keep you
[1:17:33] from staying dirty.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Okay? because it reveals your position,
[1:17:38] YOUR PLACE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; THE WASHING, SURE, IT TAKES AWAY ALL OF
[1:17:44] YOUR SINS, BUT THAT'S JUST A START.
[1:17:47] THAT'S JUST A PLACE NOW. NOW THAT YOU'VE
[1:17:50] BEEN WASHED, AMEN. YOU JUST DON'T SIT
[1:17:52] HERE AND just like every Sunday, THIS
[1:17:54] ISN'T A BATH HOUSE.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; God's word IS NOT A BATH HOUSE WHERE YOU
[1:18:00] JUST WALK IN, YOU'RE JUST LIKE BOOM, I'm
[1:18:02] clean going back out. No, it's a
[1:18:05] continual cleansing of the word. Amen.
[1:18:08] That's done for you every day. Take a
[1:18:10] bath in your own house.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; That was free.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; After the image of him that has created
[1:18:20] Titus 3:5-6.
[1:18:23] So now we're getting past just an old
[1:18:25] washing.
[1:18:27] God doesn't want you clean. The
[1:18:29] Pharisees were clean.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; The Sadducees were clean. HE SAID, "YOU
[1:18:34] WHITEWASH SUPPLERS."
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; WHITEWASHED.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; You just paint the outside. God's not
[1:18:44] interested on the outside.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; He's interested in knowing who you are.
[1:18:48] Because if you know who you are, you
[1:18:50] ain't got to worry ABOUT IT GOING BACK
[1:18:52] TO WHAT YOU WAS,
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Not by the works of righteousness. Titus
[1:18:58] 3:5-6. Not by the works of righteousness
[1:19:00] which which we have done, but by
[1:19:02] according to his mercy he has saved by
[1:19:04] the washing of regeneration
[1:19:08] and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he
[1:19:10] has said in abundance through Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ our savior.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:22 through2 that you put off
[1:19:19] the concerning the former uh conversion
[1:19:21] the old man which is corrupt according
[1:19:23] to deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[1:19:26] spirit of your mind. Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking mind over matter.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; This isn't a mind over matter. Oh, I'm
[1:19:33] just going to think good. Good things
[1:19:35] are going to happen. Boom. Something bad
[1:19:36] happened.
[1:19:39] Let's not have it. No, that's not the
[1:19:41] case. We're talking about the renewing
[1:19:43] of your mind because you're placed
[1:19:46] you're placed where God wants you.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're and you're in the
[1:19:51] word, you're renewed by the word
[1:19:55] in the spirit of your mind. And that you
[1:19:57] put on the new man which is which after
[1:19:59] God has created in the righteousness and
[1:20:01] in true holiness. Were wherefore putting
[1:20:04] away lying, speaking every man the truth
[1:20:07] to his neighbor. For we are members one
[1:20:10] to another. That's another one. That's
[1:20:12] that's a good one. Amen. To go back and
[1:20:14] to look. Now look Romans 12 1-2. And I'm
[1:20:17] going to kind of buzz through a few of
[1:20:18] these. I beseech you therefore brethren
[1:20:20] by the mercy of God that you present
[1:20:22] your bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Now those passages those the ones in
[1:20:28] Titus and they the one that I have
[1:20:29] before I told you to read it's it talks
[1:20:31] about about putting away the lying and
[1:20:33] putting away the uh the the putting away
[1:20:36] all the things of the world and and and
[1:20:38] putting all these things because you've
[1:20:39] been renewed in the mind.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. Being cleansed. That's just a
[1:20:44] start. Now we're dealing with this
[1:20:45] inward man. Amen. You're dealing with
[1:20:48] this inward man. Amen. That has to be
[1:20:50] renewed day by day. It has to constantly
[1:20:52] be dealt WITH WHETHER TO LIE or to cheat
[1:20:55] or to steal or Amen. That's the man that
[1:20:57] we're working. I beseech you, brethren.
[1:20:59] Amen. You don't want to be just like the
[1:21:01] way that you was, the way that God found
[1:21:03] you before YOU CLEANSED YOU. THAT'S NOT
[1:21:05] THE PURPOSE. AGAIN, this isn't a bath
[1:21:07] house. YOU'RE NOT JUST WASHED UP, WALKED
[1:21:09] OUT SAME WAY. BUT GOD'S WANTING TO DO
[1:21:11] SOMETHING INWARDLY. YEAH,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; you all heard it heard the expression
[1:21:15] about the pig in the suit.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; You can put a suit on a pig all that you
[1:21:20] want, but doesn't mean that it's going
[1:21:21] to stay out of the pig pin. It's nature.
[1:21:23] It's the same.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; And if your nature doesn't want to come
[1:21:27] to church, if your nature doesn't want
[1:21:28] to stay in the presence of the Lord. If
[1:21:30] your nature doesn't want these kinds of
[1:21:32] things, amen, that is what we're talking
[1:21:34] about. Not the outward man. Amen. But
[1:21:36] the inward man, AMEN, WHERE GOD CAN DO
[1:21:38] SOMETHING AT THAT INDIVIDUAL, THAT'S
[1:21:40] WHAT HE'S INTERESTED IN.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; I beseech you, brethren, that by the
[1:21:44] mercies of God, you present your body,
[1:21:45] living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
[1:21:47] the God, which is your reasonable.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; How many like to be reasonable?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I like to have reasonable prices.
[1:22:00] I like to have reasonable fair things.
[1:22:02] AND GOD'S LIKE, I'VE DONE ALL THESE
[1:22:04] THINGS. YOU CAN reasonably serve me in
[1:22:07] purity.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; I lost my place.
[1:22:15] And be not conformed to this world.
[1:22:18] Don't be conformed to it.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; There's a whole purpose of coming to
[1:22:22] Christ.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; It's because it's God calling out. The
[1:22:25] the objective is not to look the same as
[1:22:27] those that are out. to be CONFORMED TO
[1:22:30] THIS WORLD. But be ye transformed.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; By the what?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; By the what?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Not by putting on a new suit. Not by
[1:22:43] putting ON A NICE TIE. NOT BY MAKING
[1:22:45] SURE THAT YOUR SHOES ARE RIGHT. BY THE
[1:22:47] TRANSFORMING, IT'S BY THE PLACE. IT'S BY
[1:22:50] THE THE THE STATUS OF YOUR MIND IS WHERE
[1:22:54] you're at. Again, not mind over matter,
[1:22:56] but it's realizing THAT YOU'RE A SON OF
[1:22:58] GOD.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WOULD HAVE never and that never
[1:23:02] you would have never came to God unless
[1:23:04] that HE FIRST DRAWED YOU. THEREFORE, HE
[1:23:06] HAS A PURPOSE IN YOUR LIFE TO DO
[1:23:08] SOMETHING.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; He just didn't come in here as if all
[1:23:12] you know God always orchestrating
[1:23:14] certain things, put you in the right
[1:23:15] mind frame, done this, done that to be
[1:23:17] able to put you into a place. But it's
[1:23:19] you. Amen. It's not just dealing away.
[1:23:21] This is not a first aid kit. I think we
[1:23:24] talked about that actually a while back.
[1:23:27] God's not a first aid kit all of a
[1:23:28] sudden that oh I fell into sin. Just
[1:23:30] slap a band-aid on and you walk out.
[1:23:32] You're going to keep you from this
[1:23:33] situation. Therefore, you have a
[1:23:35] renewing of THE MIND AND REALIZING, HEY,
[1:23:38] I'M JUST NOT SO AND SO, BUT I MISS JESUS
[1:23:41] CHRIST.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; HEY MAN, I'M I I AM A SON AND DAUGHTER
[1:23:45] of God.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the renewing isn't just all
[1:23:50] peaches.
[1:23:52] Sometimes it's a stripping,
[1:23:55] a ripping, a tearing because sometimes
[1:23:58] you got to be able to try to dig out all
[1:24:00] of those old ideas.
[1:24:03] Sometimes you got to be able to dig out
[1:24:04] all of those old habits. Sometimes you
[1:24:07] got to be able to dig out all of your,
[1:24:08] "Hey, man. Well, this is what I used to
[1:24:10] do when this situation would happen."
[1:24:13] That's not the goal.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God's not God's not coming to
[1:24:18] wash you and and put you in his kingdom
[1:24:20] that you could represent the devil,
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; but he's he's giving you an opportunity
[1:24:25] to be transformed into his word.
[1:24:28] Sometimes it takes a tearing
[1:24:32] for both new converts and old converts
[1:24:35] alike. You could read into the
[1:24:37] scripture.
[1:24:42] It says here in Isaiah 40:28 through31,
[1:24:44] "Hast thou not known?"
[1:24:48] There's a question mark.
[1:24:50] Hast thou not heard that the ever
[1:24:54] everlasting God, the Lord, creator of
[1:24:56] the ends of the earth, faintth not?
[1:24:57] Neither is weary?
[1:25:00] THERE IS NO SEARCHING OF HIS
[1:25:02] UNDERSTANDING. YOU GOT QUESTIONS in
[1:25:04] life.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; There's no searching of his
[1:25:07] understanding.
[1:25:10] This is the one that you're supposed to
[1:25:11] look to,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; not fuchsia,
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; not whoever Dr. Dobson or whoever it is.
[1:25:18] I say, "I'm trying to figure out all
[1:25:19] these things." There's no searching to
[1:25:21] his understanding.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; He giveth power to the faint,
[1:25:28] and to them have have no might. He
[1:25:31] increasth strength. Even the youth shall
[1:25:33] fail and be weary, and the young men
[1:25:35] shall utterly fall. But they that wait
[1:25:37] on the Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:25:41] They shall mount up with wings as eagle
[1:25:43] and run and not be weary, AND THEY SHALL
[1:25:46] NOT FAINT.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Amen. You're going
[1:25:49] through life AND YOU'RE WONDERING, "OH,
[1:25:50] LORD, I I JUST DON'T KNOW. I I YOU KNOW,
[1:25:53] I YOU KNOW, I JUST DO IT GOD'S WAY BY
[1:25:56] THE WORD."
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; TAKE GOD BY HIS WORD. I UNDERSTAND THE
[1:26:00] SHIP MIGHT GET THE THE SHIP MIGHT GET A
[1:26:02] LITTLE BIT SIDEWAYS. I UNDERSTAND THE
[1:26:04] FIRE MIGHT BE HOT. AMEN. BUT BUT YET
[1:26:07] GOD'S WORD WILL PREVAIL.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; I like here in the in here in the
[1:26:14] message, the eagle stir his nest, it
[1:26:16] says, now again, we were talking about
[1:26:20] those that had been in church a while,
[1:26:22] we'll call them veterans. And those that
[1:26:24] have been those that have are
[1:26:26] backsliding, that have just come to the
[1:26:27] Lord. This is another thing about the
[1:26:29] eagle is the eagle renews his youth,
[1:26:32] renews his strength, his youth. That
[1:26:35] represents the church again because a
[1:26:37] man could be backsliden away from God
[1:26:39] and you put him in good revival
[1:26:41] somewhere and it renews his covenant. It
[1:26:44] renews his youth and he comes back to
[1:26:45] God and just feels like he's all washed
[1:26:48] up and ready to go again. That's the way
[1:26:50] the eagle does the the or he gets old
[1:26:53] and his habits and these things begin to
[1:26:55] fail and he can't see no more and all of
[1:26:57] a sudden something begins to happen
[1:26:59] again and he begins to be a new bird
[1:27:04] another place here and letting off of
[1:27:05] the pressure this old eagle he gets a
[1:27:07] crust over his face and he heard when he
[1:27:09] gets old he can't hardly eat or he gets
[1:27:12] poor his mouth won't open right he gets
[1:27:14] almost blinded and when he crust gets up
[1:27:16] in a certain spot over his head they say
[1:27:19] uh he flies eyes up way in the air and
[1:27:21] he sits there and he beats his head
[1:27:23] against a rock, knocking the crust off
[1:27:25] of it if he can. And he rolls his eyes
[1:27:28] and he he looks back and he beats the
[1:27:30] crust and oh, it must come off. It'll
[1:27:32] it'll it's got to come off if I don't.
[1:27:35] There's no other way. He beats it until
[1:27:37] the crust come off. And when he beats it
[1:27:39] off the rock until he crust comes off of
[1:27:41] it, then he screams and he throws his
[1:27:43] wings back and forth and rejoices
[1:27:45] because he's know he's going to get new
[1:27:48] feathers. He's going to get his vitamins
[1:27:50] again. He's going to renew his youth.
[1:27:52] And and I thought, what a wonderful
[1:27:54] thing that is to the to the believer.
[1:27:57] Amen. God types you as the as the ego.
[1:28:00] That's not because Amen. of that's not
[1:28:03] because
[1:28:05] that that you're something or not
[1:28:07] something that you you know God's just a
[1:28:09] metaphor but yet he's using that as a
[1:28:12] type because every believer that's right
[1:28:14] here in this church underneath the voice
[1:28:16] and can be renewed by the washing of the
[1:28:19] water by the word and that's what God
[1:28:21] desires here. Amen. Is he desires amen
[1:28:24] the word to come and to be able TO SCRUB
[1:28:27] AWAY ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS of this world.
[1:28:30] Amen. that that keeps on us and drags us
[1:28:32] down that keeps us away from prayer and
[1:28:35] it keeps us away from a clean life
[1:28:37] living before him. What we have to do
[1:28:39] and and in another place uh uh brother
[1:28:41] Brandham he sits there and he talks
[1:28:43] about a stuff called Clorox there and
[1:28:46] hiding himself in simplicity. It says
[1:28:49] they manufactured a stuff called bleach.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:55] Now,
[1:28:57] now we're talking about a cleansing,
[1:29:01] but they manufacture this stuff called
[1:29:03] bleach. He says, "And you women use it.
[1:29:06] It's a Clorox. Now, I've got a tub of
[1:29:08] Clorox sitting here. And if I drop ink
[1:29:11] into a bucket of Clorox, now find your
[1:29:14] color." What happened to it? What
[1:29:17] happens? The first thing it did, it hit
[1:29:18] the water. It hit the Clorox. The
[1:29:21] chemical was so great till it sent it
[1:29:24] all the way back. You can't see it's the
[1:29:26] fumes of it or nothing else. And it'll
[1:29:28] never be no more because it's turned
[1:29:29] back to the original place of where it
[1:29:32] comes from. And now that's exactly what
[1:29:35] the blood of Christ does to sin. The
[1:29:39] blood of Jesus Christ. confess your sins
[1:29:43] upon the blood of Jesus Christ and it
[1:29:46] emits and it puts the sea uh put in the
[1:29:48] sea of God's forgetfulness and it is
[1:29:50] remembered no more against you at all
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; the blood
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; never loses its power
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; as our musicians come
[1:30:13] It's the Clorox.
[1:30:15] The word is the agent, the cleansing
[1:30:19] agent
[1:30:20] for all of our needs here this evening,
[1:30:22] this morning.
[1:30:25] For every need that we'd have in the
[1:30:26] struggles or the things of life that we
[1:30:28] seem to be going through,
[1:30:30] God has made a remedy.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; God has made an ability for us to be
[1:30:36] able to lean to him.
[1:30:40] I like to look at this
[1:30:43] asp
[1:30:45] gentle sat
[1:30:49] as I be was thinking about this and
[1:30:51] about how
[1:30:52] God has a Clorox
[1:30:57] and when you take that Clorox first
[1:31:03] in order
[1:31:05] in order to see what's underneath the
[1:31:07] stain the stain has to be removed. moved
[1:31:11] and all of us come to a place in our
[1:31:13] walk with the Lord where there have
[1:31:15] where there's things that get in the
[1:31:16] way.
[1:31:18] There's situations that might have
[1:31:20] occurred to make you act or think a
[1:31:22] certain way
[1:31:25] or you might be going through life and
[1:31:26] it just seems to be just a a drag and it
[1:31:30] just seems to be like you just can't be
[1:31:32] getting anything. You know what? Just
[1:31:35] like Nathan,
[1:31:37] the word provided the remedy.
[1:31:40] But are we willing to do what the word
[1:31:43] prescribes?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Michael, I I
[1:31:48] mean, I'm I'm looking for this to happen
[1:31:50] or I'm looking for that to happen."
[1:31:54] If God's calling you to move, calling
[1:31:57] you to do something,
[1:31:59] maybe he needs you to get in line in
[1:32:01] order for him to work.
[1:32:04] Maybe he needs you.
[1:32:08] You know, being a being a a believer is
[1:32:10] just the beginning, but he needs you to
[1:32:12] step into place.
[1:32:15] He needs your sons to step into place so
[1:32:17] he can work through you because he's not
[1:32:20] working just through a sanctification
[1:32:22] message. That's
[1:32:25] we could we could lean to the place
[1:32:26] where we're where we're just like, "Oh,
[1:32:28] just the Lord keep cleansing me. Keep
[1:32:29] cleansing my sins. Keep cleansing." It's
[1:32:31] just not a repetitable repetitual motion
[1:32:33] of just Lord just come in cleanse my
[1:32:35] Lord change who I am.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Take that blood and let it wipe over me
[1:32:46] so it can reveal what I am. Kind of like
[1:32:48] when you clean a window. It's got a fog
[1:32:51] and you can't really see. All you see is
[1:32:52] a reflection or something. You just take
[1:32:54] it and you wipe it off and all of a
[1:32:55] sudden you could see through it. That's
[1:32:57] what you want God to do. You just don't
[1:32:58] want to just be cleansed. But you want a
[1:33:01] purpose.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; You want a purpose for being cleansed.
[1:33:04] And that's to exhibit the word for
[1:33:07] today.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; And at this time through a revealed
[1:33:11] word.
[1:33:13] There's no other time that the that that
[1:33:15] God's perfect purpose can't be
[1:33:20] brought to light in our community.
[1:33:24] Now, if you're into that place and
[1:33:25] you're like, "Lord, maybe I need to trim
[1:33:27] my lamp here this morning or
[1:33:30] Well Lord, you know what? I just need a
[1:33:33] good oldfashioned cleansing of your
[1:33:35] presence. The Lord is here. He's just as
[1:33:38] real.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Just as real as his healing power as he
[1:33:42] was then, he is today.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Kobe
[1:33:49] pass.
[1:33:55] Pass me not.
[1:34:00] Oh, pass
[1:34:03] me now.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, gentle
[1:34:18] my
[1:34:23] cry.
[1:34:30] Oh,
[1:34:36] brothers thou
[1:34:38] are calling.
[1:34:46] Do
[1:34:49] not pass
[1:34:53] me by.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I'm cry crying
[1:35:01] saveavior.
[1:35:14] Won't you hear
[1:35:18] my
[1:35:23] cry?
[1:35:30] Oh,
[1:35:33] all others
[1:35:36] thou
[1:35:39] holy,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; holy,
[1:35:44] do
[1:35:48] not pass
[1:35:50] me
[1:35:52] by.
[1:35:59] Let
[1:36:02] me be at thy throne
[1:36:07] of mercy.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; To find
[1:36:17] us
[1:36:21] release
[1:36:34] In deep
[1:36:36] contrition
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; contrition
[1:36:43] help
[1:36:47] I am
[1:36:55] singing it together. Are you saveior?
[1:37:05] Savior,
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; won't you hear
[1:37:15] my
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; hear my humble
[1:37:20] cry
[1:37:34] of holy
[1:37:41] do
[1:37:44] not pass
[1:37:48] by.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] A clean
[1:38:02] heart.
[1:38:13] and renew a right spirit
[1:38:18] within
[1:38:20] me.
[1:38:27] Create in me
[1:38:31] a clean
[1:38:34] heart.
[1:38:38] Oh
[1:38:40] God,
[1:38:45] and renew a right spirit
[1:38:50] within
[1:38:51] me.
[1:38:59] Cast me not
[1:39:02] away
[1:39:04] from thy presence,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; oh Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Take not thy Holy
[1:39:19] Spirit
[1:39:21] from me. Restore
[1:39:31] unto
[1:39:32] me
[1:39:36] the joy
[1:39:38] of thy
[1:39:39] salvation
[1:39:44] and renew arise spirit
[1:39:49] within
[1:39:51] me.
[1:39:52] Is that your prayer?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Created me.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Created
[1:39:59] me. Granted, Lord,
[1:40:08] oh
[1:40:09] God,
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; and renew a right spirit
[1:40:19] within
[1:40:20] me.
[1:40:23] Cast me not away.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; And cast me not
[1:40:32] away
[1:40:34] from my presence.
[1:40:38] Oh God,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; take not
[1:40:46] the Holy Spirit
[1:40:50] from me. Restore
[1:41:00] to me
[1:41:04] for the joy of my salation
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; and renew
[1:41:15] spirit
[1:41:17] within
[1:41:19] me.
[1:41:23] Yes.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him here this this
[1:41:30] morning.
[1:41:36] Sometimes the idea is not just
[1:41:40] or sometimes the idea is just getting
[1:41:42] passed.
[1:41:44] Yes, he's a cleanser.
[1:41:46] And yes, we need cleansing,
[1:41:50] but his word, the same word that washes
[1:41:52] us is a revealing.
[1:41:56] And we just don't want to
[1:41:59] use God as some type of just detergent
[1:42:02] when things get bad. But
[1:42:06] we want to take God and thank him for
[1:42:10] revealing who you are.
[1:42:12] And Lord, cleanse me with this word.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Cleanse me to make me more like you. And
[1:42:19] don't let me be like the world. Let me
[1:42:22] be transformed by your word. And that's
[1:42:24] what the idea is. The whole idea we come
[1:42:26] to church is,
[1:42:28] you know, I believe it was brother Merl
[1:42:30] that was talking about it before we'
[1:42:31] come out here is is not us to come and
[1:42:34] criticize the word, but it's the word to
[1:42:35] come chip and criticize your life.
[1:42:40] And if you don't like that, at least
[1:42:42] Charlie Kirk said it.
[1:42:46] But you know,
[1:42:49] God's been good to every one of us.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; And it's up to us
[1:42:55] to run efficiently to the Lord. And
[1:42:57] that's the only way to do it is just to
[1:42:59] ooze out all that bad stuff that is in
[1:43:02] us and to ooze out all the things that
[1:43:04] the world has clinged on to us.
[1:43:06] You can take God's word and it'll cut
[1:43:08] away every situation. It'll cut away
[1:43:10] everything that you need.
