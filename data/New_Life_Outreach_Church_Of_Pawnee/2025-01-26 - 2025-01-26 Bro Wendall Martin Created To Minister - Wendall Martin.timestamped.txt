[48:55] that which is come
[48:57] that ye may attend um upon the Lord
[49:01] without

[49:20] more verse here in 2 Corinthians 11 and
[49:24] and
[49:25] 1 it says I would to God that you could
[49:28] bear with me a little in my Folly and
[49:30] indeed bear with me for I am jealous
[49:33] over you with a Godly jealousy for I've
[49:37] espoused you to one husband that I may
[49:39] present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
[49:42] but I fear lest by any means as the
[49:45] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[49:48] subtlety so your minds should be
[49:50] corrupted from the
[49:52] Simplicity that is in Christ I want to

[51:14] I desired of the Lord and that will I
[51:19] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[51:23] of the Lord all the days of my life and
[51:26] to behold his
[51:29] Beauty I think there is not a greater
[51:34] call that we have than to be called The
[51:37] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[51:40] there's not a greater benefit that we
[51:42] have than to Amen to have this honor of
[51:49] of being privileged to carry his name
[51:53] amen and and we're thankful to that and
[51:56] the
[51:57] Apostle Paul was talking there in the
[52:00] second verse that I had read to you he
[52:03] says I I I I'm I'm saying something for
[52:06] your benefit amen he said if you're if
[52:09] you're married to the in the natural
[52:12] amen there will be a lot of distractions
[52:14] you caring for your natural husband your
[52:17] your wife your children but he says if
[52:20] you're married to Christ amen you you uh
[52:25] have one thing upon you and that is amen
[52:29] your attention is to him and to him
[52:33] alone amen and then he writes in the
[52:36] second uh letter to Corinthians and he
[52:40] and he and he tells them amen uh I I I I
[52:44] want you as I have espoused you as a
[52:46] chased virgin to one husband amen I want
[52:49] you to really take this

[53:12] Satan amen slipped a good one on Eve
[53:16] he'll try to do the same thing for you
[53:19] and I I say today amen that we we want
[53:22] to serve god without any kind of
[53:25] distraction in our in our Our Lives now
[53:28] there's going to be distractions amen
[53:30] we're living in an age of uh Plum full
[53:32] of distractions we're living in a world
[53:35] just Plum full of chaos but but I'm so
[53:38] glad that the prophet would tell us that
[53:40] even amen he says we see those hours
[53:43] that were in and the stage and we see uh
[53:46] what it was and the Holy Ghost rebuking
[53:48] the age that that put him out but in all
[53:51] of that did you notice to him that
[53:55] overcometh you
[53:57] he says even in that worldly Wicked
[54:00] Church age him that overcometh we find
[54:05] here that God always had Overcomers and
[54:08] he had Overcomers in every age there
[54:11] always there's always every time in
[54:14] every age there's been on the earth God
[54:17] has always had somebody who could put
[54:20] his hands upon amen as a witness in this
[54:23] earth he has never been without a
[54:26] witness oh doesn't that make you just
[54:28] want to shout hallelujah he says though
[54:32] sometimes it got down to just one amen
[54:35] somebody overcome and now like the
[54:38] Saints of old can you say Amen so I say
[54:41] today in the midst of the perversions
[54:44] there is still desire now predestination
[54:47] produces desire because there is there
[54:50] is something about a woman that come Eve
[54:53] came out from
[54:54] Adam amen she she was part of Adam when
[54:58] Adam looked at Eve amen he had said your
[55:02] bone of my bone your Flesh of My Flesh
[55:05] amen so there was something unique about
[55:08] Adam Amen in fact you know uh Eve's
[55:12] Eve's name was not given to her until
[55:16] after she produced her children amen her
[55:18] name was Adam Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[55:23] amen what was it she was simply the
[55:26] feminine part of Adam God separated the
[55:29] feminine spirit and put it in the body
[55:33] that he had made out of Adam's Rib well
[55:35] praise the Lord and so you were
[55:39] created to minister under Christ amen
[55:43] you're not created to go to church
[55:46] you're not created Amen to be a to to
[55:49] join some kind of a religious faction
[55:51] you were created to minister oh so many
[55:55] times people think amen that ministering
[55:58] under Christ means going amen you got to
[56:00] go to church and you got to do this and
[56:02] you got to do that God is wanting your
[56:05] heart God created you he created your
[56:10] spirit he created your heart because he
[56:14] wanted fellowship with you amen the
[56:16] scripture says that God created a help
[56:20] meet unto amen for Adam it was a help
[56:23] there was a cry there was she was built
[56:27] with desire to fulfill her husband oh
[56:31] that just makes me want to shout do you
[56:34] realize amen that God put you here in Le
[56:36] osia to give him praise do you realize
[56:40] that God put you here in this wicked
[56:42] Church age Amen to to to to honor him
[56:46] and to love him and to refresh him amen
[56:50] and to be his praise and his Joy his
[56:53] love his glory here on this Earth do you
[56:56] realize that you don't have to beg God
[56:58] for anything do you realize amen that it

[57:22] his love amen all that he has he has
[57:26] given to this church amen if she can
[57:29] just reach out and understand what she
[57:32] was created for can you say amen amen

[57:39] desire comes amen from that from that
[57:43] from that seed that God placed within
[57:45] you you know I looked up desire and it
[57:48] and it means to to want something
[57:50] strongly it means to have an appeal a
[57:53] longing a craving a yearning a need Amen

[58:01] or there must be someone that is worthy
[58:05] of that desire amen there there in other

[1:12:30] have taken the eyes off of the real
[1:12:34] Incorruptible value of the lady of the
[1:12:37] man and they have put it upon what they
[1:12:41] can see what they can feel hey well can
[1:12:44] you say amen amen so that is way Satan
[1:12:48] is doing this today the original sin was
[1:12:51] that great big beast of a man amen he
[1:12:55] such a hunk that caused Eve Amen to fall
[1:12:59] in adultery with him and it's that same
[1:13:03] devil today that wants to try amen to
[1:13:06] bring our relationships and our
[1:13:08] marriages and amen and and and our
[1:13:10] relationships and keep them in turmoil

[1:13:29] Divine character that comes from
[1:13:33] him all right hallelujah amen let's go
[1:13:37] move
[1:13:38] on so Satan chooses the
[1:13:43] eyes God chooses the
[1:13:47] heart and it's that heart that God deals
[1:13:51] with can you say Amen
[1:13:56] it's the heart that he reveals himself
[1:13:58] to I I want us to just stop for a few
[1:14:01] moments here this
[1:14:02] morning I want you to look at where you
[1:14:05] are today here in
[1:14:09] 2025 I I want you to look at what God
[1:14:12] has done in Redemption and how he has
[1:14:14] brought Redemption all the way amen from
[1:14:18] from the
[1:14:19] fall with a partial revelation of
[1:14:23] himself came a a partial amen atonement
[1:14:28] it was the partial Revelation that
[1:14:30] produced a lamb it was God Amen that
[1:14:34] looked down at Adam and Eve when they
[1:14:37] had fallen amen and there they are they
[1:14:40] are they're being kicked out of the
[1:14:42] garden and as they're walking out then
[1:14:44] God's heart of Love stops them he says
[1:14:48] come back here I can't stand to just see
[1:14:50] you walk away amen without some kind of
[1:14:53] atonement and what did he do amen he
[1:14:56] goes and and kills amen an animal and he
[1:15:01] takes the bloody skins and he puts it
[1:15:04] over them amen and it was a declaration
[1:15:07] amen right now I don't have a body right
[1:15:10] now I cannot redeem you amen I you you
[1:15:13] you have fallen and it's going to
[1:15:14] require a Kinsman but he says there's
[1:15:17] going to come a time when I will come
[1:15:20] and redeem you but for right now I want
[1:15:23] you to know that there is righteousness
[1:15:25] for you that there is love for you well
[1:15:27] can you say amen amen oh under partial
[1:15:31] Revelation came a lamb I I I begin to
[1:15:34] think about that here this morning amen
[1:15:36] the partial word with the partial word
[1:15:39] means an underdeveloped bride if you've
[1:15:43] only got a little bit of of of word amen
[1:15:47] you've only got you've got an immature
[1:15:49] bride there was no way that anyone under
[1:15:53] the Old Testament blood of bulls and
[1:15:56] goats could ever come into maturity
[1:16:00] under the the the shadows of blood of
[1:16:03] bulls and goats amen God's desire was
[1:16:08] for Redemption what was Redemption to
[1:16:12] bring them back to the Adam and Eve at
[1:16:15] the
[1:16:18] beginning God would raise prophets God
[1:16:22] would raise sages and they would begin
[1:16:24] to talk about that one that was to come
[1:16:26] there's coming a redeemer there's going
[1:16:28] to come one that's living in the in a
[1:16:30] body like yours he's going to be he's
[1:16:33] going amen To Love Oh Glory to God it's
[1:16:37] going to be God in a body he's going to
[1:16:40] love like God he's going to give like
[1:16:41] God he's going to heal like God he's
[1:16:43] going to redeem like God he's going to
[1:16:45] can you say Amen but it was only through
[1:16:48] the the partial amen Revelation and
[1:16:52] partial atonement part paral maturity
[1:16:56] but you see I I want you to look at this
[1:16:58] as as we as we keep in mind that you are
[1:17:02] created to love him amen now thousands
[1:17:07] and thousands of lambs were killed for
[1:17:09] the atonement thousands and thousands
[1:17:12] and thousands of lambs all throughout
[1:17:15] the Old Testament and the Old Testament
[1:17:17] believer was accepted by God through
[1:17:21] those Lambs but this partial word could
[1:17:25] only provide a
[1:17:28] substitute when I say a partial word
[1:17:31] amen the law was just partial word amen
[1:17:35] the the the Abraham had a partial word
[1:17:39] the prophets had a partial word but you
[1:17:42] see those Old Testament saints were
[1:17:45] looking at a promise that there would
[1:17:49] come a just one there would come one who
[1:17:54] could stand stand up for the human race
[1:17:57] and say I am willing to redeem
[1:18:03] her Hallelujah well can you say Amen now
[1:18:07] there would come little types partial
[1:18:09] they would begin to see a little bit
[1:18:11] amen here would come a Naomi and a Ruth
[1:18:14] talking about the Jews amen would would
[1:18:16] would also bring in the Gentiles there
[1:18:18] would be a Boaz that would be willing to
[1:18:21] Mar his own inheritance in order to
[1:18:23] redeem there there would be all of these
[1:18:25] things of the Old Testament well
[1:18:27] Hallelujah but you see it was always a
[1:18:30] looking forward it was always it's going
[1:18:33] to come it was always well praise the
[1:18:41] Lord Isaiah in the 53rd chapter he would
[1:18:47] say he's a man of
[1:18:50] Sorrows he's a man of
[1:18:53] regret they plucked his beard from him
[1:18:56] they they spat upon
[1:18:59] him who should declare his generation he
[1:19:02] he was cut off out of the land of the
[1:19:06] living surely Heath borne our sorrows
[1:19:09] Heath carried our
[1:19:11] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:19:13] was put upon him well praise the Lord
[1:19:17] there were all of these impartial
[1:19:21] words but when Jesus came he was the
[1:19:26] Fulfillment of all of those things can
[1:19:28] you say
[1:19:30] Amen when Jesus was
[1:19:33] crucified on Calvary now I want you to
[1:19:36] remember this the Old Testament blood of
[1:19:40] bulls and
[1:19:42] goats come to a an
[1:19:47] ending when Jesus while he was up there
[1:19:50] suspended Between Heaven and Earth while
[1:19:53] he was being
[1:19:55] crucified when he died the veil of the
[1:19:59] temple was rent from top to
[1:20:02] bottom no man was able to go behind that
[1:20:05] Veil any no mortal man not even a priest
[1:20:09] could go back behind that Veil only the
[1:20:11] high priest could go back behind that
[1:20:13] Veil where The Mercy Seat was and where
[1:20:15] the amen the pillar of fire would come
[1:20:17] down over the well can you say man but
[1:20:20] now I want you to be careful I want you
[1:20:22] to catch this now because when
[1:20:25] Jesus he was the Fulfillment of all the
[1:20:30] impartial
[1:20:32] scripture all of the bits all of the
[1:20:35] pieces everything throughout 4,000 years
[1:20:39] had all come to comption in the body of
[1:20:43] Jesus
[1:20:45] Christ oh now it was good to see a man
[1:20:48] Healing The Sick it was good seeing a
[1:20:50] man raising the dead but there had been
[1:20:52] people raised from the dead before there
[1:20:53] had been people heal healed from the
[1:20:55] sick before but when Jesus was crucified
[1:20:59] on Mount Calvary it was a witness that
[1:21:04] all the partial was fulfilled in that
[1:21:09] perfect
[1:21:14] lamb now it was one thing for me to
[1:21:16] declare it you declare it all of us to
[1:21:17] shout hallelujah about it but the Bible
[1:21:19] says when he raised up from the dead the
[1:21:21] all of those Old Testament Saints raised
[1:21:23] up from the dead
[1:21:26] all of those ones who had been believing
[1:21:28] God using the impartial using the blood
[1:21:32] of the Bulls and the goats they had to
[1:21:34] go down into the grave amen there was
[1:21:36] nothing about a bull and a goat but you
[1:21:38] see it was a testifying that there was
[1:21:41] going to come a kinsman redeemer oh you
[1:21:45] say what is a kinsman redeemer you see
[1:21:47] there was something missing from him
[1:21:51] amen he had a bride somewhere he had a
[1:21:54] woman somewhere she was a fallen woman
[1:21:58] and he was willing to come and look for
[1:22:01] his
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:09] bride oh can you say Amen when he raised
[1:22:13] from the dead all of those Old Testament
[1:22:15] Saints Heen what did they do they came
[1:22:17] and showed themselves all throughout
[1:22:19] Jerusalem amen they was appearing to
[1:22:21] everybody said can you imagine Here
[1:22:23] Comes Abraham walking up to you can you
[1:22:25] imagine amen here is Jeremiah and
[1:22:28] Ezekiel and they're
[1:22:30] testifying this is the one will blessed
[1:22:33] be the name of the Lord but he didn't
[1:22:35] just stop and give his life amen I
[1:22:37] believe that while he was there in the
[1:22:39] grave amen when that blood cell was
[1:22:41] broke out of that blood cell came a
[1:22:45] bride can you say Amen a bride was birth
[1:22:50] when he was put to sleep just as Adam
[1:22:53] when Adam was put to sleep amen a bride
[1:22:57] came from Adam amen a living bride born
[1:23:02] that could love him and refresh him and
[1:23:05] serve him oh can you see amen and I want
[1:23:07] to say on the day of Pentecost amen the
[1:23:11] rushing Mighty Wind the life of God come
[1:23:14] down upon that 120 amen now it is not
[1:23:18] just the man Jesus Christ but there is a
[1:23:21] bride on the earth that can Minister
[1:23:25] unto
[1:23:32] him the prophet would
[1:23:35] say notice how appropriate it was
[1:23:38] showing that Jerusalem was ceasing when
[1:23:41] it was in effect until that hour the
[1:23:44] blood of the Lamb was all right until
[1:23:46] that day but now at the crucifixion it
[1:23:50] changes the old system is done and
[1:23:53] there's a new one the lamb was at the
[1:23:55] sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb
[1:23:59] was on the
[1:24:00] grounds they were condemning and doing
[1:24:04] the very thing there that they had to
[1:24:11] do can you say
[1:24:14] Amen up until Jesus
[1:24:17] crucifixion partial
[1:24:19] word partial Redemption
[1:24:25] but when Jesus
[1:24:27] came John had already been told now stay
[1:24:31] with me because I'm fixing to get into
[1:24:32] my I want to get into my main thought
[1:24:34] right here for the next uh 15 minutes or
[1:24:37] so man John had said to whom the
[1:24:43] spirit descends upon and
[1:24:48] remains you'll know that that is the
[1:24:51] Messiah now the holy Spirit would come
[1:24:55] upon the prophets and then would leave
[1:24:57] right you could not have the perfect
[1:25:00] Holy Ghost dwelling in you under the
[1:25:03] blood of bulls and
[1:25:04] goats but God's perfect son came amen
[1:25:09] and God bear witness of
[1:25:13] him he paid the price of redemption and
[1:25:18] now the same holy ghost that was in the
[1:25:22] perfect son on the day of Pentecost is
[1:25:26] now in that Perfect
[1:25:33] Bride now there's where you're going to
[1:25:35] you going to say the bride is not
[1:25:37] perfect I want to tell you you are just
[1:25:40] as perfect as Jesus Christ is because it
[1:25:43] was the perfect blood of the perfect God
[1:25:47] living in the perfect Jesus Christ and
[1:25:50] it brought you back
[1:25:55] oh you were divorced you were separated
[1:25:58] you had nothing but he after his love
[1:26:03] went after you to bring you back unto
[1:26:09] him
[1:26:11] amen can you say
[1:26:13] amen amen now
[1:26:18] hallelujah oh my brother brand would say
[1:26:21] when the when the veil was rent at
[1:26:23] Calvary The Mercy Seat come into Plain
[1:26:26] View but what happened it was hanging on
[1:26:29] Calvary dripping in Blood and as they
[1:26:31] had took the blood year after year a a
[1:26:34] at the
[1:26:35] cleansing of the sanctuary and
[1:26:37] sprinkling of The Mercy Seat there God
[1:26:40] with his Great Mighty stroke of
[1:26:42] lightning power split the old Badger
[1:26:44] Veil from top to bottom and The Mercy
[1:26:47] Seat come into Plain View and the real
[1:26:50] genuine Lamb of God was hanging in plain
[1:26:52] view on Calvary the real Mercy Seat when
[1:26:55] God had paid the price himself and
[1:26:57] became one of us and was manifested
[1:27:00] himself as a man to get acquainted with
[1:27:02] us and we to be acquainted with him The
[1:27:05] Mercy Seat was in plain view of all
[1:27:07] Israel on the day of atonement and there
[1:27:11] Jesus says it
[1:27:14] is
[1:27:20] finished what do you mean it is finished
[1:27:23] does that mean I okay I'm I'm dying now
[1:27:26] no the Redemption had been paid what
[1:27:30] Adam could not do Adam couldn't redeem
[1:27:33] his wife well praise the Lord amen now
[1:27:37] the Bible says that Adam was not in the
[1:27:40] transgression it was Eve that was in the
[1:27:45] transgression but when Eve
[1:27:48] fell
[1:27:49] Adam could not have her living out there
[1:27:53] in Doom and him living in Paradise she
[1:27:57] was part of
[1:28:03] him Adam couldn't say well that's you
[1:28:08] know good riddens hos still of Easter
[1:28:11] baby
[1:28:12] Hallelujah she was part of
[1:28:20] him and every man toward his wife is not
[1:28:24] looking at his wife in judgment because
[1:28:27] when you look at her in judgment you're
[1:28:30] in under judgment
[1:28:32] too she is you you are her the both
[1:28:36] become
[1:28:37] one and when Eve had fallen and when Eve
[1:28:41] was was subject what can you say am man
[1:28:44] Hallelujah there she had partaken of the
[1:28:47] seed of that serpent what did he do he
[1:28:51] out of love put his seed in that womb
[1:28:55] and they both walked out can you say
[1:28:58] Amen just showing that as the bride
[1:29:02] walked out of paradise so was God going
[1:29:05] to walk out of paradise he was going to
[1:29:07] leave the Throne of Heaven he was going
[1:29:10] to live in a body he was going to hurt
[1:29:13] like you hurt he was going to be sick
[1:29:16] like you're sick he was going to suffer
[1:29:19] like you suffer he was going to have
[1:29:21] headaches like you have headaches he was
[1:29:23] going to die like you die but he was
[1:29:26] going to redeem you and bring you
[1:29:35] back oh God oh
[1:29:39] God we should never look at our
[1:29:43] wives the Apostle Paul
[1:29:45] says don't provoke your wife to
[1:29:48] bitterness and don't be bitter against
[1:29:50] them don't don't do those things
[1:29:55] but love them as the weaker
[1:29:57] vessel love
[1:30:02] them and as
[1:30:04] Christ for Love's
[1:30:09] sake as the word took on because word
[1:30:13] was doing nothing but
[1:30:15] condemning we found that through the law
[1:30:17] it was under nothing but
[1:30:19] condemnation but what the law could not
[1:30:21] do
[1:30:24] the word took on a
[1:30:26] body when the word says this is my law
[1:30:31] and when the bride was looking at the
[1:30:32] law and saying there's no way I can be
[1:30:35] that that's when the word took on a body
[1:30:39] to pay the price of their
[1:30:44] transgressions God's not looking at you
[1:30:47] this morning with eyes of Amen
[1:30:50] accusation and eyes of Amen h torment
[1:30:54] and eyes of punishment he's looking at
[1:30:57] you with eyes of Mercy I love
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:05] you I love
[1:31:10] you can you say
[1:31:14] amen

[1:31:21] wife and we don't always see eyes eye
[1:31:25] and I got to say sometimes her
[1:31:27] eyesight's better than mine
[1:31:35] Hallelujah and I don't
[1:31:37] always she doesn't always make me happy
[1:31:41] and there's plenty of times that I could
[1:31:44] hold grudges against her and she could
[1:31:47] do that to
[1:31:48] me but it's my
[1:31:52] privilege as Christ
[1:31:54] so loved the church and gave himself for
[1:31:59] it that he now watch this watch how it
[1:32:02] all it all together he the word took on
[1:32:04] the Flesh and as Christ so loved the
[1:32:08] church that he gave himself for it so
[1:32:10] that he could wash it with the washing
[1:32:13] of the Water by the word it was through
[1:32:17] his blood his sacrifice his atonement
[1:32:20] that he could come in and say now I will

[1:35:11] now because I from the
[1:35:15] beginning came out of his that rib was
[1:35:19] right next to his heart and when I

[1:36:00] doing the same thing today now I want
[1:36:02] you to see this I'm putting the two
[1:36:04] together now until that hour that the
[1:36:06] organization religion is condemned and
[1:36:10] proved to be sacrificing the word from
[1:36:12] then on comes the word and the word only
[1:36:16] from the old Pascal lamb passed away
[1:36:18] amen Christ become our lamb at the day
[1:36:21] of crucifixion and the day that the
[1:36:24] denomination has crucified the word of
[1:36:26] God and accepted a Creed instead of the
[1:36:28] word that's the day when the word comes
[1:36:32] into full effect and that's just been
[1:36:35] recently amen what is he trying to say
[1:36:37] as the imperfect came into the perfect
[1:36:40] so has it been today as Christ has
[1:36:45] comeing this last day and revealed
[1:36:48] himself as in no other day what is it a
[1:36:52] a declaration of it's a declaration that
[1:36:54] it's going home time it's a declaration
[1:36:58] that that the old prostitutes are washed
[1:37:01] away from you it's a declaration that
[1:37:04] you're going back to that Garden that
[1:37:07] you left in the
[1:37:11] beginning can you see
[1:37:16] man so the imperfect word could only
[1:37:21] bring an imperfect brother Bri and
[1:37:25] immature and we've seen the seven Church
[1:37:28] ages
[1:37:30] amen we've seen the seven Church ages
[1:37:33] and we are we have come through the ages
[1:37:37] of all of the denominations and in this
[1:37:40] last age where Christ is totally put
[1:37:42] out but at the time of his first
[1:37:46] crucifixion that was the
[1:37:49] Declaration that the God of all glory
[1:37:53] had come to maturity in a
[1:37:56] body and when the denominations have put
[1:37:59] the word out in this day it's a
[1:38:02] declaration that the Bride of all ages
[1:38:07] has come to an age of accountability and
[1:38:10] maturity and that he is ready to take
[1:38:12] her home back where she came
[1:38:18] from that should make you want to shout
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:26] created Created to minister created to
[1:38:29] love him
[1:38:30] created Oh Glory to
[1:38:33] God I don't I don't
[1:38:35] I I don't know where you are there I
[1:38:38] know there's some single mamas here
[1:38:39] there's I I I know there's there's
[1:38:41] there's been relationships that have
[1:38:43] been all messed up I understand that but
[1:38:46] I just want to tell you there ain't no
[1:38:48] messed up relationships on on the other
[1:38:51] side I guarantee you there's no
[1:38:53] Brokenness on the other side I guarantee
[1:38:55] you there's no what can you say amen
[1:38:58] hallelujah amen oh because you have
[1:39:01] caught his eye but I just want to tell
[1:39:03] you it's not that he's looking at you
[1:39:06] see God is not looking at the sensual
[1:39:09] God's not going by eyesight God's not
[1:39:11] going by ears or feelings God's going by
[1:39:14] that eternal love and that love amen you
[1:39:18] came from his heart in the beginning and
[1:39:21] his that heart will always love you can
[1:39:24] you say Amen oh great God Of Heaven how
[1:39:28] we should love him how we should adore
[1:39:31] him he loves his
[1:39:45] people love
[1:39:51] him he says God begin to brood and I'm
[1:39:54] I'm closing
[1:39:55] now brood over that and after the fall
[1:39:58] and he brought up an Enoch and
[1:40:01] Elijah a Moses he brought up Prophet
[1:40:04] after Prophet trying to restore that
[1:40:06] image again finally upon the Earth come
[1:40:09] the genuine image of God himself again
[1:40:11] which was God the logos made flesh dwelt
[1:40:13] Among Us and now that same
[1:40:17] logos has a
[1:40:19] part he's got a bride and the same logos
[1:40:24] this word cannot be tampered with it's
[1:40:27] brooding over the church
[1:40:31] today church is today trying to bring
[1:40:33] back the word to its full manifestation
[1:40:36] which the prophets were carriers to that
[1:40:38] seed the church denominations have been
[1:40:39] carrier to the seed now now notice
[1:40:42] quickly but that like the shuck hugs and
[1:40:45] holds in the seed now and then leaves
[1:40:47] her Jesus was God his father was the
[1:40:51] great logos himself he could not pour it
[1:40:54] in all into Moses for he was a prophet
[1:40:58] he could and the word of the lord always
[1:41:01] never fails comes to the prophet there's
[1:41:03] no place no time in in the Bible or
[1:41:05] since the Bible that the correct
[1:41:06] interpretation of the word comes to a
[1:41:08] theologian it's not in the scriptures
[1:41:10] never did the Pharisees or never the
[1:41:12] Sadducees never did God raise up Prophet
[1:41:15] out of any of them and never did he in
[1:41:18] these last days are you hearing but when
[1:41:22] that word
[1:41:27] comes as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:41:30] shall it be in the revealing of the son
[1:41:31] of man behold I send you Elijah the
[1:41:34] prophet before that great and Tre
[1:41:35] Dreadful day of the Lord what is God
[1:41:37] saying there's been a lot of partial
[1:41:40] there's been a little bit of this been a
[1:41:41] little bit of this but but when the all
[1:41:45] not just the partial but when the
[1:41:46] fullness of the Revelation
[1:41:50] comes then there will be a
[1:41:56] complete then there will be not a word
[1:42:01] condemning it was always word made
[1:42:06] flesh it's the word taking on flesh it's
[1:42:10] you the
[1:42:13] bride in full
[1:42:16] adornment of his
[1:42:19] word now the scripture says there in
[1:42:21] Song of Solomon he said we have a little
[1:42:23] sister who has no breast what shall we
[1:42:26] do in the day that she what shall she do
[1:42:28] in the day that she has spoken
[1:42:30] for so here comes and and the Bible's
[1:42:33] not a dirty book what she what the Bible
[1:42:36] is saying is we have a little sister
[1:42:40] that has not
[1:42:44] matured she wants to be a
[1:42:46] bride but she can't give suck to a
[1:42:51] baby she can't give nourishment to a
[1:42:56] child and that's been the church that
[1:42:59] was prophetic of the
[1:43:01] church for all of these
[1:43:03] ages because only partial word could
[1:43:07] give par could could
[1:43:10] give a portion of maturity but when the
[1:43:13] perfect word
[1:43:15] comes this lady is not one that's hiding
[1:43:18] in a corner and and saying no one look
[1:43:20] at me I hope I'm not spoken for I I have
[1:43:22] nothing thing to offer she is a matured
[1:43:26] lady she is a matured woman she is
[1:43:30] wearing the Royal garments of his
[1:43:33] righteousness which is the fine linen of
[1:43:37] his
[1:43:42] word she is
[1:43:45] perfect he has made her
[1:43:51] perfect oh
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:56] [Applause]
[1:43:58] can you say
[1:43:59] Amen
[1:44:01] now true
[1:44:06] story over
[1:44:08] there I believe it was in
[1:44:12] India there was the the the the woman or
[1:44:16] maybe it was
[1:44:19] Africa there was a family that was
[1:44:23] had a there mom and dad had a couple of
[1:44:26] daughters or had had several
[1:44:28] daughters and uh one you know all of the
[1:44:32] daughters had gotten pretty well had all
[1:44:33] gotten married off and and and they all
[1:44:36] they were some pretty girls but there
[1:44:38] was just one girl that was just very
[1:44:39] plain and and she had a great
[1:44:44] inferiority complex her sisters were all
[1:44:47] beautiful and the guys were all coming
[1:44:49] around and wanting them
[1:44:51] and and
[1:44:53] but she just she just always stayed in
[1:44:56] the background and she
[1:44:58] never never
[1:45:01] done um just never came out never really
[1:45:03] fixed herself up never when you would
[1:45:06] see her in the markets and and around
[1:45:08] her hair was just it just done anyway
[1:45:11] and she just she just looked she just
[1:45:14] looked like a
[1:45:15] servant more than she did a a daughter
[1:45:20] the other girls they have Diaries over
[1:45:21] there still do and and so when a guy
[1:45:24] would come in and wanting to ask for the
[1:45:26] for the the girl's hand you know if he
[1:45:29] comes and and and and ask you to be
[1:45:33] his uh wife then he would go talk to
[1:45:36] your dad and maybe he would bring a a
[1:45:40] pig
[1:45:41] or chicken or something whatever your
[1:45:44] value would be you
[1:45:46] know and so and then if someone would
[1:45:48] come over to this other one and say hey
[1:45:51] another man come in and might might give
[1:45:53] a cow and so then she could look at you
[1:45:55] and say you got the you got the
[1:45:58] chicken mine gave me my daddy a cow for
[1:46:02] me and you know that but that's the way
[1:46:04] they done it they they gave diaries for
[1:46:09] them so get this this this is true story
[1:46:12] this is this is in several
[1:46:14] magazines there was this there is this
[1:46:18] um but there was this prince who had
[1:46:22] come and was just just coming through
[1:46:23] the The Villages and just checking
[1:46:25] everything out and will he come across
[1:46:28] this
[1:46:29] woman he seen her there in the
[1:46:32] marketplace and their hair
[1:46:35] was sort of just tied back wasn't just
[1:46:39] wasn't fixed up sure was just really
[1:46:41] plain she was just really no one paid
[1:46:45] any attention to
[1:46:48] her but there was something about the
[1:46:50] girl that caught his eye
[1:46:53] and and she so we asked around where she
[1:46:57] comes they go well she lives out there
[1:46:58] on a certain farm and so he
[1:47:01] goes and he talks to the to the dad and
[1:47:04] says does does your daughter live here I
[1:47:06] seen would you mind me talking to her
[1:47:08] well he she heard him talking to to to
[1:47:13] her dad he she was back in the in the
[1:47:15] back of the Hut and she heard her and
[1:47:18] they she looked at herself and she said
[1:47:20] oh my goodness so when her dad came back
[1:47:22] he says she says no I no you'll get to
[1:47:25] know me and just you'll do away with me
[1:47:28] like everyone else has done I don't want
[1:47:29] nothing and and their dad says listen
[1:47:32] this man really is interested in you
[1:47:35] he's a
[1:47:36] prince I won't you so she finally comes
[1:47:40] out and talks to him and she wouldn't
[1:47:42] even look at him and she was just so she
[1:47:44] was just so ashamed of herself and
[1:47:48] and
[1:47:50] man the the the man love what what he
[1:47:53] had to what he was talking to and so
[1:47:55] finally um they began a relationship and
[1:48:01] and as he began to quarter over over
[1:48:04] time she began to to get
[1:48:10] confidence but what what really made the
[1:48:13] difference for
[1:48:14] her
[1:48:15] is when he asked her about marriage and
[1:48:18] she says I would be willing if my dad
[1:48:21] will and so
[1:48:23] he comes in and he
[1:48:26] says I want to marry your
[1:48:29] daughter and her dad says man you know
[1:48:33] what what would you have to give and he
[1:48:36] says I what what is the other's gift
[1:48:39] well I've got a chicken I've got a this
[1:48:42] and I've got a cow and I've
[1:48:44] got and and I think he had been given
[1:48:46] three cows for one
[1:48:50] girl the man looked at him and says I'll
[1:48:53] give eight
[1:48:57] cows the girl started
[1:49:00] crying just
[1:49:02] crying nobody in the entire
[1:49:06] Village had ever paid eight
[1:49:09] cows for a
