[41:21] Genesis 13 and
[41:24] 14 I enjoyed the songs this evening

[41:35] atmosphere for the word to fall in amen
[41:39] now let's have a simple subject this
[41:40] evening um on the same lines of this
[41:43] morning but if I had a a subject it
[41:46] would be looked from where you are in
[41:48] Genesis 13 and 14 the Bible would say
[41:51] and the Lord said unto Abram after lot
[41:54] was separated from him lift lift up up
[41:57] now thine eyes and look from the place
[41:59] where thou art northward Southward
[42:02] Eastward and Westward amen can we bow
[42:05] our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly
[42:07] Father Lord what an honor and a
[42:09] privilege it is to come into your house
[42:11] one more time father as we fill your
[42:13] presence that settled down Among Us Lord
[42:16] we ask that you would speak through
[42:18] these lips of clay tonight father you
[42:20] see this little thought you placed upon
[42:21] My Heart Lord I ask that it can be a
[42:23] strength and an encouragement in some
[42:25] way tonight Lord God we lay their
[42:27] service into your hands father and we
[42:29] ask that you would speak tonight Lord
[42:31] move among the hearts and the needs we
[42:33] ask these things in your precious name
[42:36] amen you may be seated um like I said my
[42:39] subject would be look from where you are
[42:41] and brother Brandon would say uh Romans
[42:43] 8:20 said those who he has predestinated
[42:46] into the Covenant you couldn't come with
[42:49] it yourself no man can come to me except
[42:52] my father draws him those who were
[42:54] predestinated he has called those who he
[42:57] has called he has Justified and those
[42:59] who he justified he has glorified then
[43:02] In God's Presence you are already
[43:04] glorified waiting isn't that marvelous
[43:07] and now while we're waiting for the
[43:08] Redemption of our bodies we are sitting
[43:10] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus uh
[43:13] the Holy Spirit moving upon the believer
[43:15] great powerful baptisms going forward
[43:18] the world on the outside laughing God
[43:20] working with them uh among them Healing
[43:23] The Sick showing Visions all kinds of
[43:25] signs and wonders the evening sun going
[43:27] down the Christian is looking up and I
[43:30] think this is pretty incredible he's
[43:32] he's painting a good picture for the
[43:33] Christians and then he says the atomic
[43:35] bombs are hanging in over there the
[43:38] world all shaking and don't know what to
[43:40] do and the Christians are shouting the
[43:42] Praises of God come Lord Jesus isn't
[43:45] that wonderful and he would say how can
[43:48] a fellow have the blues and believe
[43:50] something like that can't do it the
[43:52] blues Days Are Over All weariness and
[43:55] sadness is passed away now can't do it
[43:58] God had said so it's just got to be sure
[44:01] as there is a God in heaven we are going
[44:04] to do it and I think it's pretty
[44:06] incredible how he is saying that God is
[44:07] moving but at the same time that the
[44:10] tribulation is going to be settled
[44:11] setting again we see that the America's
[44:13] going to be bombed and be into ashes and
[44:16] he would say you can't get the blues
[44:17] there's no way you can get the blues
[44:19] knowing that there's prophecy going to
[44:22] be fulfilled and I believe we have too
[44:24] many prophecies that we can look to to
[44:26] be down to be discouraged to be brought
[44:29] down by the lies of the enemy you see
[44:32] sometimes we just have to look from
[44:33] where we are our present condition or
[44:36] present circumstances and see hope and
[44:38] see a promise that God has given us you
[44:41] see you might not have it in you in your
[44:43] hand yet but it's a promise that it's
[44:45] going to be fulfilled you see brother
[44:48] Brandon would talk about the loaf of
[44:49] bread and he would say if you ever got
[44:51] hungry he says and somebody came up to
[44:54] him and say what what do you need and he
[44:56] would say I I need a quarter to buy a
[44:58] loaf of bread he would say if somebody
[45:00] had given that to me I can Rejoice now
[45:03] for the loaf of bread even though I
[45:06] don't have it yet I've got the
[45:08] purchasing power of the loaf of bread
[45:11] all they have to do is take that quarter
[45:13] and go purchase what the quarter is able
[45:16] to purchase and brother Brandon would
[45:18] say faith is not your healing but a
[45:21] produces your healing and so we see the
[45:24] promises of God are yay and amen even
[45:26] though we might not be in the
[45:28] Fulfillment of it yet we can still
[45:30] believe that I'm looking away from
[45:33] present conditions present circumstances
[45:35] that I'm walking through looking to a
[45:38] promise and that is going to produce a
[45:40] Rapture a body change no matter what I
[45:43] go through nothing can keep me
[45:45] Earthbound and brother Brandon would say
[45:47] well you say I hope I can get get it all
[45:49] right I hope I can be well I hope I can
[45:52] get the Holy Ghost I hope I'm a
[45:54] Christian I hope to do this you don't
[45:56] want that that Abraham never looked at
[45:59] that a man against hope he still
[46:01] believed God's word faith is beyond hope
[46:04] hope comes from back here in the inside
[46:07] faith comes from in here and so Faith
[46:10] don't hope so Faith knows faith is a
[46:13] substance and brother Brandon would say
[46:15] hope is looking hope is looking and
[46:17] hoping to obtain something but faith has
[46:20] by Revelation faith is the substance of
[46:23] things hoped for and so when I mean
[46:25] we're looking from where we are are is
[46:27] by faith we we might be in financial
[46:30] trouble might be in discouragement but
[46:32] by faith we know that God is going to
[46:34] see me through not hoping that we're
[46:36] going to make it through weariness not
[46:38] hoping we're going to make it through
[46:40] troubles but by faith we know we are
[46:43] going to make it through and Abraham had
[46:45] a lot of problems that he can look to he
[46:48] he he had plenty of excuses that he
[46:50] could justify his heaviness by he was an
[46:53] old man uh Sarah was an old woman she
[46:56] couldn't have a child he couldn't
[46:57] produce a child and but even though he
[47:00] had all of these excuses he still never
[47:03] looked at the conditions that he was in
[47:06] but against hope believed in Hope and I
[47:09] believe that he's an example for us to
[47:11] look to that against hope we can believe
[47:14] in hope no matter how dry it looks we
[47:16] can look at at a promise that God is
[47:19] giving us but you see if you're
[47:21] constantly looking at a present
[47:23] condition that is going to bring you
[47:25] down with heaviness because the world's
[47:27] Bleak you know you wake up in the
[47:28] morning maybe you got aches and pains in
[47:30] your body if you're focusing on that
[47:33] that is going to discourage you or or
[47:35] maybe you look at your your bald head
[47:36] brother Mor you wake up and you think my
[47:38] goodness I'm getting older every day
[47:40] it's going to bring you down but if we
[47:42] can also look away from present
[47:45] conditions and look to a promise that
[47:47] God has given us then we can receive
[47:50] what God has given us in this generation
[47:52] brother Brandon would say this there was
[47:54] one here today he's the only one
[47:57] Hallelujah he's got the light switch in
[47:59] his hand those who set in the regions of
[48:02] the shadow of death great light is
[48:05] sprung up don't reject it receive it in
[48:08] the name of the Lord and it's easy to
[48:10] reject uh the promises of God when we
[48:13] are in the heaviness you know because
[48:15] brother Brandon would tell us in order
[48:17] to believe a lie you have to reject the
[48:19] truth right so when order to to dwell in
[48:22] the negative you have to reject the
[48:24] positive right and so in the Bible would
[48:27] tell us in in Psalms 26 or Acts 26 and8
[48:30] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[48:33] Darkness to light from the power of
[48:36] Satan unto God and so we uh so the Bible
[48:40] is telling us that Darkness and Light is
[48:42] completely different the power of Satan
[48:45] is darkness and the power of God is
[48:47] light and I believe that the shadows of
[48:49] heaviness comes from Darkness you know
[48:51] it's a heaviness and depression and
[48:53] anxiety and negativity it's not from the
[48:57] power of light it is from the power of
[48:59] Darkness so when before you can get the
[49:02] fruits to to manifest for the things of
[49:05] God you have to get out of the negative
[49:07] like I was saying this morning before
[49:10] you can be a tree of righteousness you
[49:12] have to be there has to be a swapping of
[49:14] Beauty for Ashes the Garment of Praise
[49:16] for the spirit of heaviness so before
[49:19] you can produce the light in your life
[49:22] you have to give up the negative before
[49:24] you can have the positive you got to
[49:26] give up the negative and and brother
[49:27] Brandon would tell us here strangers one
[49:30] to another but you you have to you have
[49:32] a very strange nature that is a deep
[49:35] thinker always Crossing Bridges before
[49:38] you get to it it's always a bad thing
[49:40] never happens the way you plan it and by
[49:43] that it's developed into a peptic
[49:46] condition of the stomach giving you
[49:48] stomach trouble that's right isn't that
[49:50] right sir if that is right raise your
[49:53] hand which is right couldn't be nothing
[49:55] else God Almighty knows it you know you
[49:59] now throw aside every negative thought
[50:02] and will go home and eat your supper and
[50:04] praise God and give him Praises for it
[50:07] and so we would see that this was the
[50:09] shadow of Darkness was producing the
[50:12] negativity which was bringing an ulcer
[50:14] inside of his body bringing a stomach
[50:17] condition and that is really incredible
[50:18] to think that maybe lots of sicknesses
[50:21] is from negativity you know have you
[50:23] ever thought about that before this man
[50:25] had a condition and his body because he
[50:27] had he was dwelling on negative thoughts
[50:30] you know brother brand I I believe
[50:31] brother Brandon would say if you fear
[50:33] cancer and fear you're going to get it
[50:35] something is going to come upon you and
[50:37] so if you're constantly dwelling in the
[50:40] negative and instead of on the positive
[50:42] it can produce a weariness and heaviness
[50:45] and discouragement but if you can throw
[50:47] aside every negative thought and don't
[50:50] worry about it brother brandom says he's
[50:52] crossing the bridges before he ever
[50:54] before he ever got to him it's worrying
[50:57] it's stressing and hoping it's going to
[50:59] make it all right somebody is looking at
[51:02] the negative instead of the positive but
[51:05] Brandon would say well our thoughts well
[51:07] our thoughts are always negative we come
[51:09] in the prayer line I notice we've come
[51:11] in the prayer line and and I will he
[51:14] tell me this is it this oh my you never
[51:16] get nothing like that no you're so
[51:19] negative to begin with come to the
[51:21] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[51:24] emanuel's veins and which where sinners
[51:26] plunged beneath the flow beneath the
[51:28] flood loose all their guilty stains that
[51:31] is it come with faith believing so
[51:34] there's a difference in having faith
[51:36] believing and coming and being negative
[51:39] you know too many times we we we uh we
[51:41] maybe we come to church with a negative
[51:43] with a negative mindset well we're just
[51:45] going to hear another sermon or or just
[51:47] hear a pastor teach on a Wednesday night
[51:49] and when we come with that attitude we
[51:52] don't come with faith believing to see
[51:54] the Supernatural and when that happens
[51:57] we can no longer see the promises all we
[51:59] see is present conditions and I say if
[52:02] there's ever a time to look away to
[52:04] Jesus and look away from present
[52:06] conditions and look to a promise this is
[52:09] the day not to be negative with the
[52:11] things of God but to remain positive
[52:14] brother Brandon would say he'll test
[52:16] your faith is that right he'll test your
[52:18] faith to see don't you believe that he
[52:20] said do you believe that I Died For You
[52:23] at Calvary to hear to heal you or to
[52:26] take take away your worries or whatever
[52:28] is wrong with you and I think that is
[52:31] pretty incredible that brother brandom
[52:33] he ties sickness and worries together
[52:35] you know many times we think sickness oh
[52:37] my we got an illness we need to see
[52:39] Jesus God's got to heal us but he's
[52:41] putting gift that weary is the same
[52:43] illness as sickness but he says it's
[52:45] okay the same God that died for for your
[52:49] healing also died for your weariness and
[52:51] for your worries and I don't believe we
[52:53] have to be weary every day you know
[52:55] we're living in a fast-paced world of
[52:57] pressure and anxiety but I don't believe
[53:00] that we have to live in a condition of
[53:02] worriness and brother Brandon would say
[53:04] May the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:06] move down and settle down and come on
[53:09] this audience and may the glooms of fear
[53:11] and doubts and unbelief be moved away
[53:14] Lord I believe that you'll give it to us
[53:17] just a touch of your presence They will
[53:19] receive it just move the Gloom back
[53:22] enough that their spiritual eyes can be
[53:25] opened up to see what is standing here
[53:28] in the building tonight to see your
[53:30] presence is omnipotent and that really
[53:33] stood out to me that brother Brandon was
[53:35] saying just the touch of your presence
[53:37] they can receive it and move the Gloom
[53:40] back enough to see for their spiritual
[53:43] eyes to be open to see the omnipotent
[53:46] presence of Jesus Christ and so
[53:48] gloominess can blind her eyes to the
[53:51] supernatural that is right Among Us you
[53:53] know how many's ever how many's ever
[53:55] have the thoughts after you Youth Camp I
[53:57] I know I have like after this last Youth
[53:59] Camp you come to church that next
[54:01] Wednesday or next Sunday and you think
[54:03] man I wish I wish that uh we can have
[54:05] services like at Youth Camp how many's
[54:07] ever thought of that or we come through
[54:08] our convention you know our meeting and
[54:11] the power of God would move and you just
[54:12] wish that man I wish we can have those
[54:15] services and what it is is it's the
[54:17] meetings Blues you know what I'm talking
[54:19] after the meetings your friends are back
[54:21] home you know Austin's girlfriend went
[54:23] back to Ohio and now you're sitting
[54:25] there my goodness if only this would
[54:27] last eternity I could be seeing her
[54:29] every day you know it's the meetings
[54:31] blues and here brother brandom is saying
[54:33] that it's Gloom that is blinding you to
[54:36] the omnipotent presence of Jesus Christ
[54:39] and I say Lord Let The Presence of
[54:41] Jehovah come and bathe over me and and
[54:44] push back the Gloom enough that I can
[54:46] see that Jesus Christ is the same
[54:49] yesterday today and forever I might not
[54:52] feel him right now but I know he's here
[54:54] I might not seek him with natural life
[54:56] but I know he is here I'm not allowing
[54:59] the the the the the the spirits of the
[55:01] age blind my eyes where I cannot see
[55:04] that the same God that moved at Youth
[55:06] Camp moved in our convention is the same
[55:08] God that can move on a Wednesday that
[55:10] can move on a Sunday morning that can
[55:12] move on a Sunday evening it's pushing
[55:14] back all of the Gloom and can see that
[55:17] Jesus Christ is here standing in our
[55:20] midst and you would and brother Brandon
[55:22] would would tell the story of Elisha and
[55:24] his servant how that his servant could
[55:26] not see the Chariots of Fire because he
[55:29] was so focused upon the upon the uh the
[55:32] syrians I believe that was coming up to
[55:34] kill them and here he looked out of the
[55:36] tent and could see they were surrounded
[55:39] by all of the Syrian Army and he would
[55:41] run back to Elisha and would say hey
[55:43] look what's going on outside we're
[55:45] surrounded and the prophet would look at
[55:47] him and would say more are with us than
[55:50] with him and this man could look out the
[55:52] window and think more with us there's
[55:55] just me and old man versus the king's
[55:58] Army how are we going to obtain the
[56:01] Victory and know many times we look at
[56:03] ourselves how am I going to obtain the
[56:04] victory how am I going to see a Rapture
[56:07] how am I going to see a body change
[56:09] there's no way I'm going to make it
[56:10] through the struggle I'm going to make
[56:12] it through this circumstance and then
[56:14] the prophet would say Lord open this
[56:16] Poor Boy's eyes that he can see he was
[56:19] so focused on the present condition that
[56:22] he would fail to see there was Chariots
[56:25] of Fire that surrounding Camp to produce
[56:28] the Victory and oh if you can just look
[56:30] from your present condition and you can
[56:32] look into the Unseen realm you will see
[56:35] that there's ministering Angels every
[56:37] step of the way that was pulling you
[56:39] along you know the Bible would tell us
[56:41] that after the devil left Jesus after he
[56:44] tempted him in the wilderness the
[56:46] ministering Angels would come and
[56:48] minister to him it was after the battle
[56:50] and you know but brother Brandon would
[56:52] tell us all Jesus had to do whenever he
[56:54] was on the cross was move his hand a
[56:57] certain way and the legions of angels
[56:59] would come and take him off the cross
[57:01] you see in the toughest struggle the
[57:03] toughest part of his flesh being tested
[57:06] there was ministering Angels oh even
[57:09] when he was on the cross but the Brandon
[57:11] would say the God had left him and it
[57:13] was flesh laying sitting there on the
[57:16] cross there were still Legions of angels
[57:19] oh and I say you may feel like your
[57:20] flesh is beaten down you may feel tired
[57:23] you may feel weary there's Legions of
[57:25] angels that is guiding every step that
[57:28] you take brother brandom says God sends
[57:31] forth Angels Glory what are they
[57:33] ministering Spirits Glory ministering
[57:36] Spirits sent where from the presence of
[57:38] God what to do Minister his word they're
[57:41] not to minister some Theology of some
[57:44] denominational group but to minister his
[57:47] word that's it ministering Spirits sent
[57:50] forth oh Hallelujah now you understand
[57:53] that's why you can never commit suicide
[57:55] you've tried you know brother brandom he
[57:57] would try to take his life and he would
[57:59] put the gun to his head and it would
[58:00] just click it would misfire he would try
[58:03] to grab the the electric lines to kill
[58:05] himself I believe he ministering spirits
[58:07] and that's why you've tried to give up
[58:09] you've tried to turn around you tried to
[58:11] say Lord I can't do this but you're
[58:13] still standing here today it's not by
[58:16] your might not by your power not by your
[58:18] ability it was ministering spirits that
[58:20] was with you every step of the way oh
[58:24] Hallelujah even in the worry whenever
[58:26] you're stressed it's ministering spirits
[58:28] that is ministering to you every step of
[58:31] the way and brother brandom says this
[58:33] when he died at Calvary he healed you
[58:36] when he died at Calvary he saved you and
[58:38] he took away your worries and your
[58:40] troubles only thing he can do now he
[58:43] might he might do like he did when he
[58:44] was on Earth because the Bible said he's
[58:47] the same yesterday today and forever is
[58:49] that right when he was upon Earth he did
[58:51] not claim to be a great person he just
[58:54] preached the gospel he dressed like
[58:56] other men went along just like Meek and
[58:59] humble and I think that's so incredible
[59:02] that brother brandom says if he was here
[59:04] he would do what he did back then he
[59:06] didn't claim to be somebody special he
[59:09] just preached the gospel and what did
[59:11] the the the the preaching of the Gospel
[59:13] do it brought forth Miracles it calmed
[59:15] the weary Hearts it it brought it took
[59:18] it brought a piece to the troubless and
[59:20] brother brandom says when he died at
[59:22] Calvary he he he took away your worries
[59:25] he took away your troubles and here we
[59:27] are preaching the gospel today
[59:29] proclaiming and enforcing what Calvary
[59:32] has already done for us and I believe
[59:34] it's the same gospel we're preaching
[59:36] today that it was that Jesus was
[59:38] preaching back then and the Bible would
[59:40] tell us in Genesis 1 and three God said
[59:43] let there be light and there was light
[59:45] and God saw the light that it was good
[59:48] and divided the light from the darkness
[59:50] so whenever the light would come upon
[59:52] the Earth it divided the light from the
[59:55] darkness so every shadow that was
[59:58] brought on the Earth by the darkness was
[1:00:00] then taken away because of the light and
[1:00:03] I believe that the same God that
[1:00:04] commanded let there be light like the
[1:00:06] Apostle Paul like I read this morning
[1:00:08] has shined in our hearts it's taking
[1:00:10] away every Shadow of Doubt every shadow
[1:00:13] of unbelief because the light shined in
[1:00:16] a heart you see God divided the light
[1:00:19] from the darkness and I believe in
[1:00:21] brother Brandon would say there's a man
[1:00:23] that that has a light switch in his hand
[1:00:26] let me see if I can if I can find that
[1:00:27] quote there but brandom he would say
[1:00:30] that uh uh there's a man here that can
[1:00:31] turn on the lights and he would say he
[1:00:33] is holding the light switch in his hand
[1:00:36] and I think that is so incredible that
[1:00:37] all you have to do is say Lord I'm in
[1:00:40] need just like we were saying this
[1:00:41] morning whenever the disciples was there
[1:00:43] on the boat the the the the one that was
[1:00:46] able to bring a peace to the storm was
[1:00:48] there all along all they had to do was
[1:00:51] wake him up right but the brandom says
[1:00:53] there's Jesus that has a light switch in
[1:00:55] his hand but all you got to do is ask
[1:00:57] him and I say Lord help me to look from
[1:01:00] my present condition and say Lord turn
[1:01:02] on the lights that I can see the
[1:01:04] promises that is for in fulfillment of
[1:01:07] today and brother Brandon would say at
[1:01:08] this glorious Sunrise God Vindicated his
[1:01:12] word and all the glooms and doubt that
[1:01:14] have moved in the people's minds were
[1:01:17] removed the Bible would say though I
[1:01:19] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:01:21] death I fear no evil for thou art my rod
[1:01:24] and my stat and they comfort me he's not
[1:01:27] keeping you from the shadows of of death
[1:01:30] but he's he's guiding you and keeping
[1:01:32] you not keeping you away from the
[1:01:34] shadows of death but he's keeping you
[1:01:36] through the Shadows when we go through
[1:01:38] them even in the negative there's a
[1:01:40] positive word that is bringing a comfort
[1:01:43] the Bible would say in 2 Thessalonians
[1:01:45] 2:1:1 that ye'd be not soon shaken in
[1:01:48] mind or be trouble neither by Spirit nor
[1:01:52] by word nor by letter from us as the day
[1:01:55] of Christ is at hand and he and he's
[1:01:58] specifying there's Spirits there's words
[1:02:00] maybe even letters that comes to you but
[1:02:03] but but but keep in mind that the day of
[1:02:05] Christ is at hand so I don't believe
[1:02:08] that men's words can trouble us I don't
[1:02:10] believe that the letters that comes
[1:02:12] against you can trouble you if you keep
[1:02:14] in mind and focus on the coming of the
[1:02:17] Lord there is something that is going to
[1:02:19] take you through you see many times we
[1:02:22] like focusing on the negative that we
[1:02:24] miss out on the bless blessings of God
[1:02:26] how many's ever been there you know like
[1:02:28] like I was saying a few minutes ago we
[1:02:31] get uh we we we we like the the
[1:02:33] environment of meetings and we get
[1:02:35] depressed when we come back to church
[1:02:37] and I as I was looking at these things
[1:02:39] this really stood out to me because
[1:02:41] whenever you are at meetings you forget
[1:02:43] about your troubles how many's ever can
[1:02:45] testify of that you forget about your
[1:02:47] troubles you forget about things that
[1:02:49] are at home and then you want to go from
[1:02:51] meeting to meeting to meeting to meeting
[1:02:53] because you like that feeling right
[1:02:55] there's Li Liberty there's Freedom you
[1:02:57] all the all the worries that are staying
[1:02:59] at home there's nothing coming against
[1:03:01] your mind but I don't believe that just
[1:03:03] happens that at camps or meetings but we
[1:03:06] can get so involved with this message
[1:03:09] that when we go to work we can live in
[1:03:11] Liberty when we when we at home with our
[1:03:13] family there can be a freedom we still
[1:03:15] have to deal with things but it's not
[1:03:17] worrying us amen we still have to deal
[1:03:20] with pressures we still have to deal
[1:03:22] with struggles but we're keeping our
[1:03:24] eyes upon the POS POS and brother
[1:03:26] brandom says you might have lost your
[1:03:28] health you might have lost your
[1:03:29] fellowship take him at his word and be
[1:03:32] certain that he is God the gloomy times
[1:03:36] that's looking now might not look so
[1:03:38] gloomy if you'll just take his word and
[1:03:41] be certain that he is God oh man that
[1:03:44] really done my heart good the gloomy
[1:03:45] times might not look so gloomy if you
[1:03:48] just take God out of his word and be
[1:03:50] certain that he's God too many times we
[1:03:53] make you know we make a mountain out of
[1:03:54] an ant hill oh man I I'm going down for
[1:03:57] the count this time I'm about to die but
[1:03:59] the brandom says it might not be so bad
[1:04:01] if you can just look up the promise of
[1:04:03] God and that and and I hope this this
[1:04:06] can come together a little bit this
[1:04:07] evening that if you can just look from
[1:04:09] where you are the troubles might not
[1:04:11] look so bad if you can keep your eyes on
[1:04:14] the promise the circumstances might not
[1:04:16] be so bad you might feel like you're
[1:04:18] about to go down from the count but just
[1:04:20] remember there's a promise and brother
[1:04:22] Brandon will talk about the German
[1:04:24] painting that that uh uh that the that
[1:04:27] this painter would would paint a picture
[1:04:29] and it was called the the the cloud land
[1:04:31] and brother brandom says from AF far off
[1:04:33] it looks like a bunch of gloominess he
[1:04:35] says there's a bunch of clouds and he
[1:04:37] says once you got up closer it would
[1:04:39] change and it's so incredible he says if
[1:04:42] once you got up closer and really looked
[1:04:44] at it he says it wasn't clouds it was
[1:04:46] angels and he says it was Angels Wings
[1:04:48] beating together from afar all you can
[1:04:51] see was clouds from afar all you can see
[1:04:54] was circumstances from afar all you can
[1:04:57] see was troubles but if you look up
[1:04:59] close there's ministering Angels oh
[1:05:02] Hallelujah if you just look through the
[1:05:04] lens of God's word you can see that the
[1:05:07] reason I'm still standing today was
[1:05:10] there was angels that was guiding me
[1:05:12] every step of the way brother brandom he
[1:05:14] would say in Germany once I saw a
[1:05:16] picture and it always said always stuck
[1:05:19] with me a German painter has painted a
[1:05:21] picture that's called the cloud land and
[1:05:24] when you see it off at a distance it's
[1:05:26] the horriblest looking Gloom that you
[1:05:28] ever seen the the clouds just Matt it
[1:05:31] together when you're looking at it from
[1:05:32] a long distance but when you get real
[1:05:34] close to it it changes it's angel's
[1:05:37] wings beating together singing
[1:05:39] Hallelujah to the Lord so that's what
[1:05:41] Gloom is sometimes if you look at it at
[1:05:43] a long distance it looks gloomy and dark
[1:05:46] but take God's word and be sech him that
[1:05:49] is God and move up close to it you'll
[1:05:52] find that it's just Eagle wings beating
[1:05:55] together
[1:05:56] he says that's what Gloom is sometimes
[1:05:59] from a distance it looks like you're
[1:06:00] going down but if you get up close and
[1:06:02] you look it's just an angels Wings sing
[1:06:05] Hallelujah to the Lord and that's the
[1:06:07] reason that we have to look away from
[1:06:09] our troubles we have to have to look
[1:06:11] away from our present conditions cuz
[1:06:13] here was Abraham the father of Nations
[1:06:15] without yet having a child and here come
[1:06:18] here come God speaking to him after he
[1:06:21] separated himself and it's it's so
[1:06:23] incredible that once he was still
[1:06:25] identif ified with the world or
[1:06:26] identified with lot he was never going
[1:06:29] to hear the voice of God but once he
[1:06:31] separated then God would come and let
[1:06:33] him know now that you're separated from
[1:06:36] lot now look from where you are and if
[1:06:39] there's ever a time to separate from the
[1:06:41] things of the world it is now and if you
[1:06:43] are it's time to look and possess oh my
[1:06:47] it ain't time just to look back and say
[1:06:48] man I wish I can have no he would in the
[1:06:50] Bible would tell us after that after
[1:06:52] that verse the next verse he would say
[1:06:54] arise and walk through the length of it
[1:06:57] the breadth of it so once you look from
[1:06:59] where you are and see the promises of
[1:07:02] God now it's time to possess it oh
[1:07:05] Hallelujah I think it's time that we
[1:07:07] possess every promise that God has
[1:07:09] promised us in this generation oh if
[1:07:13] anybody had a reason to cry and to and
[1:07:16] to whine it was Jonah and brother
[1:07:18] Brandon would say that we don't have it
[1:07:20] as near as worse as Jonah would have it
[1:07:23] you know and the Bible would tell us
[1:07:24] that he would cry out by the reason of
[1:07:27] his Affliction but then at the end of it
[1:07:30] he would say I will yet again look
[1:07:32] towards the Holy Temple and once he
[1:07:34] looked towards the temple the Bible
[1:07:36] would say he would call the things that
[1:07:38] he was looking at lying vanities ain't
[1:07:41] that incredible that before he would
[1:07:43] turn his eyes from his present condition
[1:07:46] to the Holy Temple he was crying out by
[1:07:48] the reason of his his Affliction but
[1:07:51] once he lifted up his eyes he would say
[1:07:53] these are lying vanities oh oh
[1:07:55] Hallelujah these are lying vanities
[1:07:58] these ain't going to take me down but
[1:07:59] it's just taking me to the predestinated
[1:08:02] will of God and ain't that incredible to
[1:08:04] think about that even though he was
[1:08:06] running from God God would allow lying
[1:08:09] vanities to bring him right back to the
[1:08:12] course that God had for his life hey and
[1:08:14] you never know maybe you feel
[1:08:16] backsliding you may feel like you you're
[1:08:18] running from God but God still has a
[1:08:21] hand upon your life you know that's so
[1:08:23] incredible you can never outrun the
[1:08:25] grace of God you see and the Bible just
[1:08:29] says In Jonah 2 and8 and they that
[1:08:31] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[1:08:34] Mercy they that observe them they that
[1:08:36] are constantly looking at them or
[1:08:38] forsaking their own Mercy the next verse
[1:08:41] but I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[1:08:44] voice of Thanksgiving so it went from
[1:08:47] crying to God to to to changing to a
[1:08:50] voice of Thanksgiving praising God we
[1:08:52] can still praise God on the hard times
[1:08:54] we can praise God in the trials we can
[1:08:57] praise God in the circumstances but the
[1:08:59] brandom says oh how gloomy it must have
[1:09:01] been he's talking about the widow woman
[1:09:03] that was about to eat her last meal and
[1:09:05] die oh how gloomy a must have been death
[1:09:08] laying there at the door her her and her
[1:09:10] son had to eat one little piece of a
[1:09:13] cake and Dy that was all of it and
[1:09:16] sometimes right in the midst of the
[1:09:18] Gloom we hear the voice so right there
[1:09:21] can you imagine being this little woman
[1:09:22] you're running out of water you have one
[1:09:24] meal left Not only was she about to die
[1:09:27] but her son was about to die and that
[1:09:29] really strikes home as a parent I'm sure
[1:09:32] parents can can can can testify of it
[1:09:34] I'm sure she felt like a failure another
[1:09:36] failure Not only was she about to die
[1:09:39] but her son was about to die and I'm
[1:09:41] sure she tried everything possible to
[1:09:43] find water or maybe to find some meal or
[1:09:46] or or or find some oil but all of her
[1:09:48] failure or all of her all of her e
[1:09:51] efforts were in vain and here she was
[1:09:53] she was about to die and then she would
[1:09:55] hear a voice in the midst of her Gloom
[1:09:57] she would hear a voice and what would
[1:09:59] that voice ask her to do and you know I
[1:10:02] think it's it's it's it's incredible
[1:10:03] that the voice would ask her give me a
[1:10:06] cake give me something to eat now she
[1:10:08] had to turn from her Gloom and look to a
[1:10:11] promise because all she had was one meal
[1:10:14] left right all she had was one meal left
[1:10:17] that she was going to die and here had
[1:10:18] come a prophet saying give me that last
[1:10:20] meal you got give me that last cake that
[1:10:22] you would have and then the Bible would
[1:10:24] say here in first king 17-13 and Elijah
[1:10:27] said unto her fear not go and do as thou
[1:10:30] has said but make me thereof a little
[1:10:32] cake first and bring it unto me and
[1:10:35] after make thee make for thee and for
[1:10:38] thy son for thus saeth the Lord for the
[1:10:40] Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal
[1:10:43] shall not waste neither shall the course
[1:10:45] Cruise of oil fail until the day that
[1:10:48] the Lord send the Rin upon the Earth so
[1:10:51] once she looked away from her present
[1:10:54] condition and will look to a promise
[1:10:56] then the barrel of meal would rise up
[1:10:58] you see God ain't forsaken you God God
[1:11:01] hasn't left you but the Brandon would
[1:11:02] say God I'm looking to you now maybe you
[1:11:05] had worries maybe you had financial
[1:11:07] troubles whatever it is no matter what
[1:11:09] it is cast it right Yonder against
[1:11:12] Calvary for all the things are possible
[1:11:15] to them that believe he would say in
[1:11:18] another place and meet with us Lord and
[1:11:20] give us one of the greatest nights that
[1:11:22] we've had yet people are waiting with
[1:11:24] great anticipation and the and Lord
[1:11:27] while this great anticipation is on May
[1:11:29] men and women look from this Earthbound
[1:11:32] condition that we're setting to a
[1:11:34] heavenly father that is ready to pour
[1:11:36] out his blessings and power upon us
[1:11:39] maybe look from this Earthbound
[1:11:41] condition to a heavenly father that is
[1:11:43] ready to pour out a blessing upon us you
[1:11:46] see I don't believe God has done with
[1:11:48] new life Outreach you believe that
[1:11:50] believe that this evening God ain't done
[1:11:51] with this little church God ain't done
[1:11:53] with your marriages God ain't done with
[1:11:54] your home homes he's not done with your
[1:11:56] children but God is look waiting for you
[1:11:59] to look from this Earthbound condition
[1:12:01] your present condition to our Heavenly
[1:12:03] Father the Bible would say in
[1:12:05] Deuteronomy 28:2 and all these blessings
[1:12:08] shall come on thee and overtake thee not
[1:12:11] just come on the but they're going to
[1:12:13] they're going to cover you they're going
[1:12:14] to wrap you like I was saying this
[1:12:16] morning that brother brandom says we're
[1:12:18] wrapped in the life of the blood cell of
[1:12:21] Jesus Christ so if we're wrapped in it
[1:12:23] that means the devil cannot get to you
[1:12:25] unless he can get through the blood and
[1:12:27] here de Deuteronomy is saying these
[1:12:29] blessings shall come upon thee and
[1:12:31] overtake thee and I say Lord I'm willing
[1:12:33] to look away the B brother Brandon would
[1:12:35] say but Jesus wants to give you the best
[1:12:38] thing that anybody could give you and
[1:12:40] the and the only one that could give it
[1:12:42] eternal life healing for the body swap
[1:12:45] your weariness for Joy take the Gloom
[1:12:48] away and give you a shout of Victory
[1:12:51] it's the blessings of God that is going
[1:12:53] to overtake you but you got to swap the
[1:12:55] weariness for joy and that's going to
[1:12:58] give you a shout of Victory oh man you
[1:13:00] ever want to praise God get rid of the
[1:13:01] weariness you want to praise God get rid
[1:13:04] of the Gloom brother the Brandon going
[1:13:05] say this somehow or another or somehow
[1:13:08] another I feel we're going there's
[1:13:10] something laying right ahead for us now
[1:13:13] just remember I believe I'm prophesying
[1:13:15] great Joys lay ahead believe it that's
[1:13:19] right many sad in Hearts will be made
[1:13:22] great Mysteries will be made clear
[1:13:24] people who were sad would be turned into
[1:13:27] joy and the and it says the congregation
[1:13:29] rejoices he says I believe I'm
[1:13:32] prophesying that there's something ahead
[1:13:34] for us not some great Joys lay ahead of
[1:13:38] and he says believe it and I believe I
[1:13:40] can quote this Pro quote the prophecy
[1:13:42] for New Life Outreach this just wasn't
[1:13:45] for for uh Jeffersonville but I believe
[1:13:47] that's for New Life Outreach there's
[1:13:49] great Joys ahead of us there's Revival
[1:13:51] ahead of us the the the the the Rapture
[1:13:54] is ahead of us healings uh deliverances
[1:13:57] whatever you have need of but the
[1:13:58] Brandon would prophesy and he would say
[1:14:01] great Joys lay ahead of us oh Hallelujah
[1:14:04] he says many people who are sad would be
[1:14:07] turned into Joy many people that are sad
[1:14:10] depressed lonely feel Forsaken and he
[1:14:12] says just believe it oh Hallelujah and I
[1:14:15] believe I'm claiming that prophecy for
[1:14:17] this little church that I believe that
[1:14:19] God is still working in these pews God's
[1:14:21] still working in this pull pit God's
[1:14:23] still working getting a bride ready for
[1:14:25] the coming of the Lord but I like how it
[1:14:28] says at the end of that quote the
[1:14:29] congregation rejoices because they swap
[1:14:32] their weariness for joy and then they
[1:14:35] can put on that Garment of Praise and
[1:14:37] say hey I'm identifying with that
[1:14:39] prophecy I'm identifying you know you
[1:14:41] can look at blind bmus and and and and
[1:14:44] history would tell us that the blind
[1:14:46] people would have a Beggar's cloak on
[1:14:48] and that cloak would identify him as a
[1:14:50] beggar and so whenever Jesus would come
[1:14:53] by his way and would give him his my
[1:14:55] sight he didn't need that cloak any
[1:14:57] longer because his weariness was swapped
[1:14:59] for joy and he can lay off the beggar's
[1:15:02] garment and take on the Garment of
[1:15:04] Praise he can say Look What the Lord Has
[1:15:07] Done I once was blind but now I see and
[1:15:10] I think it's time that we take off the
[1:15:13] spirit of of heaviness and put on the
[1:15:16] Garment of Praise and said Look What the
[1:15:18] Lord Has Done I once was discouraged I
[1:15:21] once was bound for hell I once was
[1:15:23] heading to a tribulation but now I got a
[1:15:25] new garment on and I can praise God
[1:15:28] hallelujah I can praise God cuz there
[1:15:31] are some good things in store for me
[1:15:33] brother Brandon would say not not not
[1:15:36] say well I if I can feel it I'd feel the
[1:15:38] glory of God falling oh that is nothing
[1:15:40] to do with it not a thing open up that
[1:15:43] mind that's the Battleground that's
[1:15:45] where the battle sets in Array right
[1:15:47] here in the front line your mind open up
[1:15:50] and see every doubt I doubt my doubts
[1:15:53] I'm doubting my doubts now
[1:15:55] I'm believing God's word here I come
[1:15:58] Satan something is going to take place
[1:16:01] sure it will yes sir I'm doubting my
[1:16:04] doubts you see too many times we doubt
[1:16:06] God's word and believe the doubts
[1:16:08] brother brandom says I'm doubting my
[1:16:10] doubts and I'm saying Satan here I come
[1:16:13] too many times we stay on the offensive
[1:16:15] and on the defensive instead of going on
[1:16:18] the offensive and saying I want my joy
[1:16:20] back I want my peace back I want my
[1:16:22] healing back I'm looking from where I am
[1:16:25] to a Heavenly Father brother brandom
[1:16:27] says I wonder if we all tonight can look
[1:16:29] and see what Barabas saw someone taking
[1:16:32] our place he was wounded for our
[1:16:34] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:16:36] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:16:39] was upon him and with his stripes I was
[1:16:42] healed you were healed I wonder if we
[1:16:45] the guilty ones who should be sick can
[1:16:48] see in him our deliverance you who
[1:16:51] should go to hell see in him your
[1:16:54] freedom see your path to Heaven I wonder
[1:16:56] if you can see what Barabas saw on that
[1:16:58] day I wonder if we the guilty ones that
[1:17:01] should be sick can see in him hallelujah
[1:17:05] amen brother Brandon would say this the
[1:17:07] Bible would the Bible said he ascended
[1:17:09] on high and gave gifts unto men there
[1:17:11] was an atmosphere that hung over the
[1:17:14] Earth of Darkness of Gloom and death and
[1:17:16] weary the prayers couldn't even come up
[1:17:19] because but because of the atone because
[1:17:21] the atonement wasn't made but he broke
[1:17:24] through the Veil and opened up the way
[1:17:26] he broke the veil of sickness he broke
[1:17:28] the veil of sin he broke the veil of
[1:17:30] weariness he broke the veil of
[1:17:32] depression he broke every Veil and when
[1:17:35] we look at him we see in him our freedom
[1:17:38] we see in him our joy we see in him our
[1:17:42] Liberty and and the joy of our Salvation
[1:17:45] let let our musicians come this evening
[1:17:47] I like how the Bible would put it in 1
[1:17:49] Peter 1 and6 wherein you greatly Rejoice
[1:17:53] though now for a season
[1:17:55] if need be ye are in heaviness just for
[1:17:58] a season and you see seasons are going
[1:18:00] to pass Seasons comes season goes just
[1:18:04] like fall comes spring comes winter
[1:18:06] comes summer comes they come but you
[1:18:08] know that there's an end coming to that
[1:18:10] season and here the Bible is saying if
[1:18:13] right now you're in a heaviness it's
[1:18:15] only for a season and I believe that
[1:18:17] season's going to change one day Amen
[1:18:20] brother Brandon would say and when when
[1:18:21] he's seen when he's seen in the
[1:18:23] beginning in our first parents fall he
[1:18:26] seen the Covenant he made with Adam he
[1:18:28] tried to hook the ladder unto him and
[1:18:30] failed there was nothing else he could
[1:18:33] hook it to but to bring down his own son
[1:18:36] and he hooked it to him so it can't fall
[1:18:39] now so what are we worried about what
[1:18:41] are we stewing about why are we going
[1:18:43] along great with a great big long face
[1:18:46] let's look up and grin look up and not
[1:18:49] only grin but laugh not only laugh but
[1:18:51] raise up holy hands everywhere giving
[1:18:54] praises and glory to God for his
[1:18:56] promises are yay and amen not yes and no
[1:18:59] or not yes and no but yes there's no no
[1:19:02] in it it is yes he says how can we fail
[1:19:06] now why are we worried about it why do
[1:19:08] we have a long face he says look up and
[1:19:11] grin you know I was there in
[1:19:13] Pennsylvania there brother Jim Shu mak's
[1:19:15] meeting and Uncle Shawn was ministering
[1:19:17] and he read that quote I'd never heard
[1:19:19] that before just look up and grin he
[1:19:21] says why the long face what are we
[1:19:23] worried about just look up and grin I
[1:19:26] see we should be the happiest people on
[1:19:28] the face of the Earth amen we know we're
[1:19:30] we know we're ending of tribulation it's
[1:19:33] a rapture we know our end ain't the
[1:19:35] depression it's a sound of mind we know
[1:19:37] our end ain't going down in defeat so if
[1:19:40] there's ever a people that should put on
