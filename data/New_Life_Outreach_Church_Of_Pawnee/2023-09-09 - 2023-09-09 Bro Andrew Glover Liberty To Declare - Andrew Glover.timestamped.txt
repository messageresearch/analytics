[1:12:08] amen if you have your Bibles tonight we
[1:12:10] want to go straight to the word if you
[1:12:11] turn with us to the book of Isaiah the
[1:12:14] 53rd chapter and that we want to look
[1:12:15] there in the eighth verse and while
[1:12:18] you're turning there I do want to say
[1:12:19] it's a honor and a privilege to be here

[1:12:47] headship of this message amen and we
[1:12:50] sure sure appreciate him and also want
[1:12:52] to uh to greet you tonight on behalf of
[1:12:54] brother Wayne he said it's not of course
[1:12:56] you know he's not able to be here but he
[1:12:58] sends his greetings to you and we sure
[1:13:00] appreciate brother Wayne and his stand
[1:13:02] for this word and amen I know if he if
[1:13:05] he could he'd be here amen but we are
[1:13:07] sure praying for brother Randall and the
[1:13:09] Lord's bringing him right along from
[1:13:11] that stroke and amen God is just
[1:13:13] merciful to his children amen and we
[1:13:16] thank the Lord for that amen the book of
[1:13:18] Isaiah the 53rd chapter
[1:13:20] and the eighth verse the Bible here said
[1:13:23] he was taken from prison and from
[1:13:26] judgment
[1:13:27] and who shall declare his generation
[1:13:31] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:13:33] the living
[1:13:34] for the transgression of my people was
[1:13:37] he stricken
[1:13:38] now one translation of that city was
[1:13:40] taken away by distress and judgment
[1:13:44] who shall declare his generation
[1:13:48] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:13:50] the living for the transgression of my
[1:13:52] people was she stricken now if we could
[1:13:54] turn to the book of First Corinthians
[1:13:56] the second chapter
[1:13:57] the book of First Corinthians the second
[1:14:00] chapter we've just read from the
[1:14:01] atonement and I believe that that
[1:14:04] atonement is in full effect here tonight
[1:14:05] don't you
[1:14:06] I believe healing is in it Deliverance
[1:14:08] is in it salvation is in it everything
[1:14:11] the Church of the Living God has need of
[1:14:13] is in that atonement tonight
[1:14:15] and if we turn here to the book of First
[1:14:17] Corinthians the second chapter Paul
[1:14:18] you're writing he uses a word that
[1:14:21] Isaiah used he says I Brethren when I
[1:14:23] came to you came not with Excellency of
[1:14:25] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:14:29] the testimony of God so the question was
[1:14:32] asking Isaiah who shall declare his
[1:14:34] generation
[1:14:35] first or second First Corinthians 2 Paul
[1:14:39] tells us that when he come to us he come
[1:14:41] declaring the testimony of God for I
[1:14:43] determined not to know anything among
[1:14:45] you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:14:48] and I was with you in weakness and in
[1:14:49] fear and in much trembling and my speech
[1:14:52] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:14:55] words of man's Wisdom but in the
[1:14:57] demonstration or we could say the
[1:14:59] Vindication of the spirit and of power
[1:15:02] now notice why Paul delivered the
[1:15:05] testimony of God the way that he did so
[1:15:07] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:15:10] wisdom of men but it should stand in the
[1:15:12] power of God your faith should not stand
[1:15:15] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:15:18] God now I want to look one other place
[1:15:19] with you in the book of Acts the 20th
[1:15:21] chapter
[1:15:22] the book of Acts the 20th chapter and I
[1:15:25] want to read a few verses there in Acts
[1:15:27] 20 beginning with verse 27 Paul here is
[1:15:31] coming down to the end of his time here
[1:15:34] and in my Bible The Heading actually
[1:15:36] says the farewell words and I love these
[1:15:39] words of Paul in verse 27 he says I have
[1:15:42] not shunned to declare unto you all
[1:15:45] somebody say all
[1:15:46] I have not shunned to declare unto you
[1:15:49] all the counsel of God now take heed
[1:15:51] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[1:15:53] flock over which the Holy Ghost hath
[1:15:55] made you overseer to feed the Church of
[1:15:58] God which he hath purchased with his own
[1:16:00] blood now brother remember says this is
[1:16:02] a prophecy for I know this that after my
[1:16:05] departing shall Grievous wolves enter in
[1:16:07] among you not sparing the flock and also
[1:16:10] of your own self shall men arise
[1:16:12] speaking perverse things now here's the
[1:16:14] reason why to draw away disciples after
[1:16:17] them therefore watch and remember that
[1:16:20] by the space of three years I cease not
[1:16:22] to warn every one of you night and day
[1:16:24] with tears and now Brethren I command
[1:16:27] you to God and to the word of his grace
[1:16:29] notice which is able it's not possibly
[1:16:32] going to happen it's more than able to
[1:16:34] happen which is able to build you up and
[1:16:38] to give you an inheritance among all
[1:16:40] them which are Sanctified amen how many
[1:16:43] thanks the Lord for the reading of his
[1:16:44] word tonight amen God bless you as you
[1:16:47] can be seated here this afternoon I want
[1:16:49] to tonight just to speak to you here and
[1:16:51] if I title this tonight I don't want to
[1:16:52] speak to you on Liberty to declare
[1:16:55] Liberty to declare you know I got to
[1:16:58] thinking sometimes we wonder what we
[1:17:00] need to really be amen what God has
[1:17:02] called us to be do we need a maybe a new
[1:17:04] church or do we need a new place or a
[1:17:06] new house or what what do we really need
[1:17:08] to be what God has called us to be but
[1:17:11] I'll tell you what I believe in by
[1:17:12] studying the message that what we need
[1:17:14] is Liberty amen I believe that's all we
[1:17:17] need to be what God has called us to be
[1:17:19] amen is Liberty Paul says this the Lord
[1:17:22] is that Spirit brother Jonathan quoted
[1:17:24] last night the Lord is that spirit and
[1:17:26] we're the spirit of the Lord is amen
[1:17:28] there is Liberty where the spirit of the
[1:17:31] Lord is there is Liberty now that word
[1:17:33] Liberty it means Liberty to do or to
[1:17:36] admit things having no relationship to
[1:17:38] Salvation it is the license or the
[1:17:41] Liberty to do as one pleases amen it in
[1:17:44] true Liberty is living as we ought to
[1:17:46] amen and not as we please now amen I so
[1:17:49] appreciate it this morning how that
[1:17:50] brother Sean was laying out that this
[1:17:52] message amen is not legalism it's not a
[1:17:55] bunch of do's and don'ts amen amen but
[1:17:57] this message is a message of Grace so
[1:18:00] when we preach the grace of God we're
[1:18:02] not preaching the grace of God to give
[1:18:04] the church a license to sin amen but we
[1:18:07] are preaching the grace of God to give
[1:18:08] the church the license Amen to be what
[1:18:11] God called them to be amen and Liberty
[1:18:14] can only come to the grace of God now
[1:18:16] the prophet of God said a doctor said to
[1:18:17] me not long ago oh I was talking to him
[1:18:19] and he said brother Brandon what's the
[1:18:21] matter with those people said they're
[1:18:22] just worked up that's what makes him act
[1:18:24] like that crying running to the altar
[1:18:26] said it's emotion I said Doctor you
[1:18:29] ought to know enough it takes something
[1:18:30] to excite the nerve amen before that a
[1:18:33] person could be emotional he said
[1:18:35] certainly it is now listen to The
[1:18:36] Prophet it's something present amen it's
[1:18:39] something present and it is true that
[1:18:42] when the Holy Ghost comes down it stirs
[1:18:44] the crowd to emotion he said their
[1:18:46] Anointed with the spirit of God and the
[1:18:48] Holy Spirit sweeps across them amen it
[1:18:51] stirs an emotion it's got to because
[1:18:53] Jesus said if they hold their peace amen
[1:18:56] the rocks will immediately cry out and
[1:18:59] what could we do he said now when I
[1:19:00] think of that amen now listen it ain't
[1:19:03] the people he said it ain't the people
[1:19:05] shining it's the Holy Ghost shining on
[1:19:07] them amen that's doing these things
[1:19:09] that's what's doing it it's not the
[1:19:11] people it's the spirit of God on them
[1:19:14] amen that makes them believe so you're
[1:19:17] not believing amen and just because of
[1:19:19] who you are or what church you attend
[1:19:21] amen but you are believing because there
[1:19:23] is a liberty that has come upon your
[1:19:25] life from the grace of God Amen to
[1:19:28] believe these things it is the spirit of
[1:19:30] God on them amen that gives them Liberty
[1:19:32] it is the spirit of God on them amen
[1:19:35] that makes them feel free amen I say
[1:19:38] this tonight we do not have to feel
[1:19:39] embarrassed we do not have to feel
[1:19:41] ashamed we do not have to reserve amen
[1:19:44] who we are amen because what is
[1:19:46] wholeness is not coming from who we are
[1:19:48] amen it is coming from the liberty of
[1:19:51] the grace of God that has been bestowed
[1:19:53] upon our life and amen we have quickly
[1:19:55] now identified amen that the source of
[1:19:58] Liberty is the spirit of God Amen if
[1:20:01] there's no Spirit there's no Liberty
[1:20:03] amen if there's no Liberty it's because
[1:20:05] there's no spirit amen but I just want
[1:20:07] to say that God supplies the Liberty
[1:20:10] that's why that wherever we go we can
[1:20:12] have church amen if nobody else wants to
[1:20:14] we can have church ain't been because we
[1:20:17] didn't come here to get everything life
[1:20:18] amen we brought our own Revival with us
[1:20:21] we didn't come here to see if there was
[1:20:23] any Liberty amen when we come here amen
[1:20:26] we brought our own liberty with us
[1:20:27] because this is not a church Revival
[1:20:29] it's not a man-made Revival amen it is a
[1:20:33] word born Revival it is a Revival of
[1:20:35] anointing it is a Revival of Liberty
[1:20:38] that's why I say this amen you didn't
[1:20:40] give me my Liberty and you can't take it
[1:20:42] away amen you didn't give me my joy and
[1:20:45] you can't take it away you didn't give
[1:20:47] me my faith and you can't take it away
[1:20:49] amen the liberty of the grace of God Has
[1:20:52] Come From God into our flesh to manifest
[1:20:55] amen the message of the hour and to
[1:20:57] declare it now amen I believe that the
[1:21:00] message of the hour is Amen to
[1:21:02] manifestation of Liberty the Bible says
[1:21:05] in first John 1 1 that which was from
[1:21:07] the beginning which we have heard which
[1:21:09] we have seen with our eyes we have
[1:21:10] looked upon on our hands have handled
[1:21:12] amen of the word of life he says for the
[1:21:15] life was manifested and we have seen it
[1:21:17] and Bear witness and show unto you amen
[1:21:20] that eternal life which was with the
[1:21:22] father and was manifested unto us now
[1:21:25] we're not talking about any kind of life
[1:21:27] now we're talking about manifested life
[1:21:30] and verse 3 John says that which we have
[1:21:32] seen amen and heard declare we unto you
[1:21:36] amen that you may also have fellowship
[1:21:38] with us and truly our fellowship is with
[1:21:41] the father and with his son Jesus Christ
[1:21:43] amen I just want to Inland a foundation
[1:21:46] to break down amen three words there in
[1:21:48] first John 1 3. John says that which we
[1:21:51] have seen that word seen it means to see
[1:21:54] with the eyes it means to see with the
[1:21:56] mind it means to perceive it means to
[1:21:58] become acquainted with amen by
[1:22:00] experience it means amen this word gives
[1:22:03] prominence Amen to the Discerning mind
[1:22:06] so so what your eyes can see amen your
[1:22:09] mind can proceed amen but then John
[1:22:11] moves down and says what we have seen
[1:22:13] amen and her listen this word heard it
[1:22:16] means to be in dude with the faculty of
[1:22:18] hearing it means not to be deaf to
[1:22:20] attend to it means to perceive by the
[1:22:23] ear what is announced in one's presence
[1:22:26] Amen to perceive by the ear what is
[1:22:29] announced in one's presence amen it
[1:22:31] means to learn or to give ear to a
[1:22:34] teaching amen or a teacher or to
[1:22:36] comprehend to understand amen now watch
[1:22:38] John has moved from the mind and now
[1:22:40] he's moved to the ear amen but he does
[1:22:43] not stop at the mind he does not stop at
[1:22:45] the ear but he goes on and says what we
[1:22:47] have seen and what we have heard amen
[1:22:50] declare and that word declare it needs
[1:22:52] to bring Tidings from a person or a
[1:22:54] thing it means to bring a word a report
[1:22:57] Amen to Proclaim and to make known
[1:22:59] openly they've been to declare that
[1:23:02] which has been seen and which has been
[1:23:04] heard amen I want to say this we have
[1:23:06] heard the message amen we have seen the
[1:23:08] message we have read the message amen
[1:23:11] but if there's ever been a time Amen to
[1:23:13] give our voice to this message amen now
[1:23:16] is the time amen not just to see the
[1:23:18] message not just to hear the message but
[1:23:21] now is the time to rise up and declare
[1:23:23] what you have seen declare what you have
[1:23:26] heard declare what your faith has
[1:23:28] brought into you by the reality of
[1:23:30] Christ amen and these things right we
[1:23:32] unto you amen that your joy might be
[1:23:35] full I love what John says in verse 5 he
[1:23:38] says this then is the message amen this
[1:23:41] then is the message that word message is
[1:23:43] an announcement it is a promise it is
[1:23:45] the act of promising amen it is a
[1:23:47] promise given or to be given it is a
[1:23:50] promised good or a blessing so we can
[1:23:52] read first John 1 5 and say this then is
[1:23:55] the announcement or this then is the
[1:23:57] promise or this then is the blessing
[1:24:00] that God has given this generation that
[1:24:02] there is no darkness in God but he is a
[1:24:05] God of Light amen I say it like Isaiah
[1:24:07] said he said now has heard and see all
[1:24:10] this and will not ye declare it now come
[1:24:13] on church amen you've heard it you've
[1:24:16] seen it but will you not declare it have
[1:24:18] I showed you these new things from this
[1:24:20] time amen even hidden things amen that
[1:24:23] thou did us not know them so whatever is
[1:24:27] being seen and whatever is being heard
[1:24:29] amen is worthy to be declared it is
[1:24:33] worthy to be proclaimed it is worthy to
[1:24:36] be published and then now the problem of
[1:24:38] God you know these quotes and I'm just
[1:24:39] laying the foundation and the message
[1:24:41] from that time 62 he said my Ministry is
[1:24:44] different he said from a pastor or a
[1:24:47] teacher he said I'm not and if I say
[1:24:49] things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't
[1:24:50] mean to amen but this is my Ministry
[1:24:53] Amen to declare him that he's here amen
[1:24:57] my Ministry is not amen a pastor or an
[1:25:00] evangelist amen but my Ministry is to
[1:25:03] declare him that he is here how could he
[1:25:06] declare he's here unless same that he's
[1:25:09] here and he has heard that he's here and
[1:25:11] he is revealing himself and he is here
[1:25:13] listen church we are not under
[1:25:15] Impressions we are not under feelings we
[1:25:17] are not under spooky things from the
[1:25:19] atmosphere when we say he's here it's
[1:25:22] because he's here and the power of his
[1:25:24] resurrection is because we see the
[1:25:26] influence of a supernatural being moving
[1:25:29] across the congregation listen I'm not a
[1:25:31] crazy man I am a believer that believes
[1:25:34] in a literal presence of Jesus Christ
[1:25:36] coming in the church by the message of
[1:25:39] the earth I think if you Cheney's here I
[1:25:41] think if you've heard he's here I think
[1:25:43] it's time somebody declare he's not just
[1:25:46] in the Pulpit he's not just in the music
[1:25:48] he's in the pews he's in the flesh he's
[1:25:52] in the young people he's in the old
[1:25:53] people he's in the preachers he's in the
[1:25:56] deacons he's in the babies my mom's hers
[1:25:59] my God is not in the Tomb and Jefferson
[1:26:01] meal he's not in a team in Jerusalem I
[1:26:04] have seen his appearing I have heard the
[1:26:06] voice of the seventh angel and I declare
[1:26:09] he's here
[1:26:12] I didn't just see it I didn't just hear
[1:26:15] it I'm going to declare it he's here and
[1:26:19] then somebody shout he's here
[1:26:21] he's here he's not just coming he's here
[1:26:24] notice 1965. amen I told you what a
[1:26:28] prophet said in my Ministry is to
[1:26:30] declare him
[1:26:32] he's here go to 1965. notice the very
[1:26:35] day when this messenger not when he
[1:26:37] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:26:40] his message
[1:26:42] when he begins to declare his message
[1:26:44] see the first pool was healing the
[1:26:46] second pole was prophesied but the third
[1:26:49] poem was the opening of the word it was
[1:26:52] the Mysteries revealed and there's no
[1:26:54] more higher order to reveal the word
[1:26:57] than prophets but the only way a prophet
[1:26:59] can be Vindicated amen is by the word
[1:27:02] and remember the third poem was the
[1:27:05] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[1:27:08] the hidden truth which had been sealed
[1:27:10] in the word so a prophet was announcing
[1:27:13] I have seen his appearing I have heard
[1:27:16] his voice and now I'm declaring to you
[1:27:18] that the message is not the first poor
[1:27:21] the message is not the second pill but
[1:27:24] the message is the third poem the
[1:27:26] revenge Nation it's the season to
[1:27:28] declare that the god of Abraham and the
[1:27:31] god of Isaac has returned to his seed in

[1:28:17] chosen way which is his prophet he said
[1:28:20] he came The Chosen way his word came and
[1:28:23] that was by His prophets which were
[1:28:25] predestinated and for ordained amen
[1:28:28] being a part of God's word amen
[1:28:31] declaring the revelation of his word to
[1:28:34] that age and that time so when a prophet
[1:28:36] begins to declare something amen he's
[1:28:39] not declaring something that has
[1:28:41] happened just in the past and he's not
[1:28:43] putting it way out in the future but
[1:28:45] he's declaring the revelation of the
[1:28:47] word in the air come on don't you see
[1:28:49] why there's an anointing in these
[1:28:51] meetings these guys are not just
[1:28:53] appearing John 14 12 and Mark 11 and
[1:28:56] Mark 16. amen by the God that was there
[1:28:58] when the Bible was being wrote has
[1:29:01] returned in this age unto the unveiling
[1:29:04] of the Mighty God and he is here in the
[1:29:06] building listen the same pillar of power
[1:29:08] that was on the Damascus Road that was
[1:29:11] on Mount Sinai that's returned in this
[1:29:14] church amen to confirm every word listen
[1:29:16] my God is not a way my God is right here
[1:29:20] in this building tonight to declare to
[1:29:22] you you are John 14 12. you are Mark 16.
[1:29:27] you learn Mark 11. you Lord come on
[1:29:29] Church you are the manifestly declared
[1:29:32] Epistles that have not been written by
[1:29:34] each they have not been written in stone
[1:29:36] but by the spirit and the grace of God
[1:29:38] he has wrote his word in the heart of
[1:29:41] his Believers and somebody's going to
[1:29:43] declare it
[1:29:45] somebody's going to declare it see
[1:29:47] because when that Prophet comes he
[1:29:49] always points back Amen to a great
[1:29:52] Supernatural God he said a modern day
[1:29:54] Prophet is a preacher so a real true
[1:29:57] preacher amen only points back to the
[1:29:59] word of the Lord which is the promise of
[1:30:01] the Lord now listen he's not pointing to
[1:30:03] the Declaration that the church is made
[1:30:06] but he is pointing to a declaration that
[1:30:09] God has made see back to the word of the
[1:30:13] Lord when a prophet begins to declare
[1:30:15] himself he is not pointing to the
[1:30:17] church's declaration he is pointing to
[1:30:20] God's declaration now you say Prophet
[1:30:22] yeah he must be Vindicated right so now
[1:30:25] let's watch of indicated Prophet 1951 I
[1:30:28] stand Here amen declaring the creator of
[1:30:32] the heavens and the Earth is Jehovah God
[1:30:34] he said now I claim to be a
[1:30:36] representative of his in this last day
[1:30:38] to bring a faith to his church so what
[1:30:41] he was declaring was not something to
[1:30:43] argue about come on now it was not
[1:30:46] something to fuss about it was not a new
[1:30:48] approach to baptism and a better way to
[1:30:50] preach the seals and a better way to
[1:30:52] preach Divine heal him but what he was
[1:30:54] delivering to the church was a
[1:30:56] declaration from the back part of God's
[1:30:58] mind come on now amen to bring a faith
[1:31:02] into the church do you realize the AIDS
[1:31:04] the seventh angel sounds is the age
[1:31:06] he'll say faith will be slow amen but
[1:31:09] listen it may be sure our fair but it's
[1:31:11] not slowing here because somebody is
[1:31:14] declaring the god of the Bible it's not
[1:31:17] a historical Affair but he's right here
[1:31:19] tonight come on Church he's here to save
[1:31:22] he's here to heal he's here to deliver
[1:31:26] he's bringing a faith into the church to
[1:31:29] believe for the impossible he's bringing
[1:31:31] a paper to the church to believe for the
[1:31:33] supernatural amen I'm just going to say
[1:31:35] what a prophet said he said in the name
[1:31:37] of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in
[1:31:40] here under my control to declare the
[1:31:43] word of God I I've ever spared in here
[1:31:46] here under my control to declare the
[1:31:49] word of God do you see what he was doing
[1:31:51] he was not asking for Liberty he was
[1:31:54] using his Liberty he was not beg in for
[1:31:57] Liberty he was using the Liberty that he
[1:32:00] received on the Ohio River he was using
[1:32:02] the liberty and he received in a cave he
[1:32:05] was using the Liberty he would shoot in
[1:32:07] the license that God gave him as a
[1:32:09] prophet to stand in cold formal
[1:32:11] intellectual Gatherings and declare that
[1:32:13] Jesus Christ is the god and he's a
[1:32:16] living God come on church amen you think
[1:32:18] you'd have a message if a prophet asked
[1:32:21] ever Baptist if it was okay to preach do
[1:32:23] you think you'd have a message if he
[1:32:25] asked every Pentecostal if it was okay
[1:32:27] to preach tongues it's not the evidence
[1:32:29] of the Holy Ghost he had a license by
[1:32:32] the predestinated seed only inside of
[1:32:35] his soul and when the anointing come by
[1:32:37] he didn't back up he stepped into it and
[1:32:40] began to declare Liberty

[1:33:02] you're too bad and you're too bound and
[1:33:05] you're too old you need to take your
[1:33:07] Liberty to cut that devil's head off and
[1:33:10] put that devil in his place and remind
[1:33:12] him you're not a legalistic Believer

[1:33:20] your life there's a Grace upon you
[1:33:22] Church
[1:33:24] there's a Grace upon you there's a
[1:33:26] license in your soul come on you ain't

[1:33:50] lose celebrity we might as well shut the
[1:33:52] doors and padlock the building but I
[1:33:55] want to protect devil on notice there's
[1:33:57] a new generation who will not back up
[1:33:59] able
[1:34:02] [Applause]

[1:34:18] seen and what they've heard now listen
[1:34:20] I'll tell you why you got to declare it
[1:34:21] it's cause there's a responsibility upon
[1:34:23] your life to do it

[1:34:59] long are we going to sit here and let
[1:35:01] the devil put us in a corner and tell us
[1:35:03] to take a cold potato away I'm sick of
[1:35:05] cold potatoes I'm sick of arguing
[1:35:08] impressive and who can say what I think
[1:35:10] it's time to bring back the joy that's
[1:35:12] unspeakable
[1:35:13] I think it's okay to bring back good
[1:35:16] old-fashioned oh they go shouting and
[1:35:18] dancing and get back on the Holy Ghost
[1:35:20] and preach in the message
[1:35:24] I know you wish you could but you can't
[1:35:26] take my Liberty cause you didn't give it

[1:35:33] got the Holy Ghost I got my own
[1:35:36] Revelation and I didn't come here and
[1:35:37] ask you if I can I come here to tell you
[1:35:39] you can you can get the same Holy Ghost
[1:35:42] you can get the same experience you can
[1:35:44] get the same reality
[1:35:49] somebody ought to declare it somebody
[1:35:52] ought to declared
[1:35:54] somebody giving praise let somebody push
[1:35:57] that old cold formal scorching
[1:35:59] intellectual prayed people out of the
[1:36:01] house of God well I'm afraid I'm afraid
[1:36:04] somebody match out I'm afraid somebody
[1:36:06] might Dance I'm afraid somebody might
[1:36:09] preach but you know what the devil's
[1:36:10] afraid of he's afraid somebody might get
[1:36:12] healed he's afraid somebody might get
[1:36:14] the Holy Ghost so you know what I do I
[1:36:17] cast out your fear I cast out your
[1:36:19] anxiety I cash capture imperviousness
[1:36:22] and impact the liberty of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:25] to come in this feeling until it will
[1:36:27] shackle pause every demon please ever
[1:36:30] spirit is rebuked and the liberty of the
[1:36:32] Holy Ghost
[1:36:35] close to the church once again
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:43] prophet of God said you got to declare
[1:36:45] it he said everything is a
[1:36:47] responsibility
[1:36:49] that responsibility to preach it you got
[1:36:52] a responsibility to believe it
[1:36:56] and we might as well go ahead and preach
[1:36:58] I got a responsibility to find it and
[1:37:00] shred it you got a responsibility get
[1:37:02] behind it
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:06] I know I know
[1:37:08] well let's preach a minute everything's
[1:37:10] responsibility he said it's hard to say
[1:37:12] but it's true ministers many times they
[1:37:15] shirk a responsibility see for standing
[1:37:17] for the true word of God when they're
[1:37:19] confronted with it see they'll shirk
[1:37:21] that responsibility when the truth of
[1:37:23] the word of God is brought face to face
[1:37:25] with three human beings we are prone to
[1:37:27] shirk back into the last resource
[1:37:29] message to the layout of sin age he said
[1:37:31] before the church can ever be taken to
[1:37:33] Glory it has to go through this world of
[1:37:36] criticism and sometimes we try to shirt
[1:37:39] back or pull back from criticism
[1:37:42] adoption part one he said God forbid
[1:37:45] that I ever shirk the job now in Acts 20
[1:37:48] 27 he says I have not shunned to declare
[1:37:51] unto you somebody says shun to declare
[1:37:55] unto you all all
[1:37:59] all
[1:38:01] the Council of God now look at this word
[1:38:04] shine it means to draw back it means to
[1:38:07] let down it means to lower
[1:38:09] wow it needs to withdraw from something
[1:38:11] it is of a timid person to withdraw
[1:38:14] oneself and to become timid listen it is
[1:38:17] of those who from Timothy hesitate to
[1:38:19] even Avail what they believe to be
[1:38:22] unwilling to utter from Fear so when you
[1:38:24] begin to sense something it's only
[1:38:26] because a spirit of fear
[1:38:30] a spirit of fear has come into the midst
[1:38:33] and to the atmosphere and there's a
[1:38:35] little bit of fear that says you really
[1:38:37] shouldn't say it or you really shouldn't
[1:38:39] go there amen but let me just tell you
[1:38:40] what Paul said he said I'm not shunned
[1:38:43] to declare unto you the whole Council of
[1:38:45] God and that word counsel is the purpose
[1:38:47] of God which you all know brother REM
[1:38:49] teaches us that nothing somebody say
[1:38:51] nothing that nothing can defeat the
[1:38:54] purpose of God he said woe unto me if I
[1:38:57] don't declare this counsel of God to the
[1:38:59] people of this healing power and he's
[1:39:02] here woe unto me if I only declare unto
[1:39:05] you that the message of Malachi 4 was a
[1:39:08] healing campaign or a shot in the hand
[1:39:10] rolling to me God forbid that I stand
[1:39:13] and appropriate and because of a spirit
[1:39:15] of fear refuse to declare to the people
[1:39:17] that's a god of the circle is in the
[1:39:20] heart of the Bride by the baptism of the
[1:39:22] Holy Ghost wrawn to me if I stand in the
[1:39:24] propane and son to declare the seventh
[1:39:27] seal is open woe unto me if I stand in
[1:39:29] the pulpit and failed to reach the
[1:39:31] revealed crash of this age come on
[1:39:33] Church well I might as well go and say
[1:39:35] it and woe unto you if you sit in the
[1:39:37] message Church
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:42] that crosses your Baptist idea or your
[1:39:45] Pentecostal idea I say away with those
[1:39:47] ideas and upper for Resurrection Jesus
[1:39:50] of this age
[1:39:53] now come on Church you say preacher
[1:39:55] you're getting triumphant I've got a
[1:39:57] responsibility you've got a
[1:39:59] responsibility it's to declare the word
[1:40:01] of God he said I know that it's
[1:40:03] something keep it back then God's going
[1:40:05] to make me pay for it as a day of
[1:40:07] judgment he said in this divinely
[1:40:09] revealed by the Holy Spirit the same
[1:40:12] angel of God that directs me to visions
[1:40:14] and directs me to see things is here
[1:40:17] Healing The Sick So the same Angel
[1:40:19] that's there when he's Healing The Sick
[1:40:21] praying for the sick when he's seeing
[1:40:23] visions is the same angel that was in
[1:40:26] the third pool he never changed angels
[1:40:29] for dispensation he only changed offices
[1:40:31] come on now it was the same God in the
[1:40:34] first book it was the same God in the
[1:40:36] second floor but in the third Paul he
[1:40:39] was bringing a bride's commission to
[1:40:41] firm the presence of God that's why Paul
[1:40:44] would write to Timothy and he would say
[1:40:45] these notable words he would say preach
[1:40:48] the word I come on I can preach here for
[1:40:50] a second preach the word you know what
[1:40:52] that's what everyone believer ought to
[1:40:53] be saying is preach the word preach the
[1:40:57] word I know I know I know sometimes we
[1:41:00] get in our mind amen that our personal
[1:41:02] convictions are very important but let
[1:41:04] me remind you Paul did not write to
[1:41:06] Timothy and say preach your personal
[1:41:08] convictions he wrote to Timothy and said
[1:41:11] preach the word
[1:41:13] preach the word so if you're going to
[1:41:15] stand In a Pulpit you can't stand there
[1:41:17] and say what you want to say you can't
[1:41:19] stand there and say whatever comes
[1:41:21] through your mind you can't stand there
[1:41:22] and say well you know what I don't want
[1:41:24] to get too deep so I didn't study I'm
[1:41:26] just going to get up here and say
[1:41:27] whatever comes to mind we don't care
[1:41:29] what's coming to your mind we got a
[1:41:31] message and it's a filter and you ought
[1:41:33] to lay in the pressure to that filter
[1:41:35] and let it filter out your mind filter
[1:41:37] out your spirit
[1:41:39] hurt me a lot less confusion if we'd get
[1:41:41] back to preaching the message and quit
[1:41:43] preaching personal convictions and
[1:41:45] feelings and what I think and I feel I
[1:41:47] don't care what you think I don't care
[1:41:49] what I feel I want to know what is God
[1:41:51] declared through the voice of the
[1:41:53] seventh angel than the age I'm living
[1:41:57] I remember one time I was out preaching
[1:42:00] somewhere a guy come to me and said I'm
[1:42:02] gonna give you an idea I want you to
[1:42:03] preach it he said it's my personal
[1:42:04] conviction I said what's that brother
[1:42:06] brother William he got to tell me all
[1:42:08] this stuff amen how to even Adam I mean
[1:42:11] bunch of crazy stuff he got done he said
[1:42:13] now go preacher I said I ain't gonna go
[1:42:15] preach that he said why not he said this
[1:42:17] because it's my personal conviction I
[1:42:19] said brother I Don't Preach my own
[1:42:20] personal conviction I sure ain't gonna
[1:42:22] preach yours
[1:42:25] come on church we got a message to
[1:42:28] declare time is running out the gospel

[1:42:33] time with a bunch of petty complexes and
[1:42:35] so and so down there amen let it all go
[1:42:38] and that's the liberty of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:40] come back to the church again and
[1:42:43] manifest himself in our demonstration
[1:42:46] preach the word preach the word you have
[1:42:49] orders from a Vindicated Prophet preach

[1:43:29] something brother Peter if I raise my

[1:44:45] take the gloves off and preach
[1:44:47] cause the preaching of the Gospel
[1:44:50] is the casting out of the devil
[1:44:53] when you preach the gospel it casts the
[1:44:57] devil out you say preacher aren't you
[1:44:59] afraid to stand there and preach this
[1:45:01] message well I learned a long time ago
[1:45:03] from my pastor Amen to a sermon I think
[1:45:06] for every even before we ever even moved
[1:45:08] to Virginia brother Sean I heard you
[1:45:09] stand somewhere and declare that the
[1:45:11] angel of the Lord
[1:45:13] accompanies the message hallways do you
[1:45:16] realize who you are tonight you are the
[1:45:18] Bride of Jesus Christ and your TAP in
[1:45:21] the Bible is Zion and Hebrews 12 22 says
[1:45:25] that ye are coming to Mount Zion unto a
[1:45:27] city of the Living God the heavenly
[1:45:29] Jerusalem listening to an innumerable I
[1:45:33] come on Church you have come to an
[1:45:35] innumerable accident am I reading that
[1:45:38] right an innumerable company of Angels
[1:45:41] the proud of God said injection of time
[1:45:43] he said Angels appear in the end time
[1:45:45] all the prophets in the signpost point
[1:45:47] to it in this day that angels will
[1:45:49] appear prophets will arise signs and
[1:45:52] wonders and if God did that for the
[1:45:53] those little Junctions back there what
[1:45:56] will he do now when all hell is turned
[1:45:58] loose all heaven will turn loose angels
[1:46:01] will appear signs and wonders on the
[1:46:03] earth another place he said the angels
[1:46:05] of God that's gone on Pursuit after
[1:46:07] these demon powers that have taken the
[1:46:09] People by force that God has sent his
[1:46:11] angels and they're here declaring the
[1:46:14] resurrection of the Lord Jesus the
[1:46:16] angels of God have been dispatched for
[1:46:19] the might from the presence of God with
[1:46:21] a commission to go search out the Sons
[1:46:24] and Daughters of God who had been taken
[1:46:26] by force and when they get in the midst
[1:46:29] of the Captivity to declare the
[1:46:31] resurrection of Jesus Christ and by the
[1:46:34] declaring of the Resurrection is the
[1:46:36] rebuking of the stronghold by the
[1:46:38] declaring of the Resurrection is the
[1:46:40] rebuking of the spirit of
[1:46:42] animal friends
[1:46:43] I didn't nothing else but
[1:46:45] Jesus Christ is alive and well and his
[1:46:49] power is here angels are here signs are
[1:46:52] here wonders are here amen and Satan I
[1:46:54] surely he says in the name of Jesus
[1:46:57] Christ by The Living Word
[1:47:00] now listen what Paul said he said I've
[1:47:02] not shunned so Paul didn't get scared he
[1:47:04] knew who was accompanied him he knew who
[1:47:07] was with him he knew who was revealing
[1:47:09] these things to him and he said I have
[1:47:11] not shunned to declare unto you all
[1:47:13] somebody say oh
[1:47:15] oh the counsel of God you say why are
[1:47:17] you saying that because remember son
[1:47:19] means to be willing to utter from Fear
[1:47:22] to be unwilling to utter what should be
[1:47:24] uttered for a spirit of fear now I'm
[1:47:27] going to take the gloves off and just
[1:47:28] preach for a second the prophet of God
[1:47:30] said one of the greatest curses on the
[1:47:32] church today is fear one of the greatest
[1:47:34] curses on the church today is fear
[1:47:37] everybody is scared to death it's what's
[1:47:39] going to happen who what some of that
[1:47:42] some of that language brother Manuel
[1:47:43] what's going to happen who what listen
[1:47:45] the prophet he said it's the greatest
[1:47:47] curse on the church today is fear do you
[1:47:50] realize in your Bible over I think it's
[1:47:53] 365 times in your Bible the Bible refers
[1:47:56] Brother Sam to fear not do not be afraid
[1:47:59] the Bible gives you a promise for every
[1:48:01] day of the year
[1:48:04] the Bible gives you a promise for every
[1:48:07] day of the year not to live in fear not
[1:48:10] to walk in fear but then said watch the
[1:48:12] greatest curse on the church today is
[1:48:14] fear what did Jesus say he said fear not
[1:48:17] little flock it's your father's good
[1:48:19] pleasure to give you the kingdom I love
[1:48:22] what Paul says to Timothy he said God
[1:48:24] hath not somebody say hath not hath not
[1:48:27] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[1:48:31] of power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:48:34] Brotherhood love is a powerful force he
[1:48:37] said there's nothing more strong than
[1:48:39] love he said love will make you trust
[1:48:41] love has no fear love casts out fear he
[1:48:45] says one of the greatest things I find
[1:48:46] among them is fear and what makes fear
[1:48:49] is a lack of confidence if you lack
[1:48:51] confidence it'll make you fear but if
[1:48:53] you love it Cast Away that fear and
[1:48:55] that's the way God wants his church amen
[1:48:58] not so many charter members he wants
[1:49:00] members that's loyal and loves and
[1:49:02] believes and has confidence in him he
[1:49:05] wants members and his Royal who loves
[1:49:07] him who believes him and who has
[1:49:09] confidence in what his Prophet was sent
[1:49:12] to the age to declare listen friends I'm
[1:49:14] going to do something right here I'm
[1:49:15] going to use my Liberty to rebuke the
[1:49:18] spirit of fear I'm going to use my
[1:49:20] license to rebuke the spirit of fear I'm
[1:49:22] going to use my Liberty right now to
[1:49:25] rebuke the spirit of fear you say why
[1:49:27] because spirit of fear is defeated it is
[1:49:30] held the church long enough I think it's
[1:49:32] time to lose the fear and get a hold of
[1:49:35] faith I think it's time to quit being
[1:49:37] scared and worried and nervous and tore
[1:49:40] up and if I say it what's going to
[1:49:42] happen and if I don't say what's going
[1:49:43] to happen if I raise my hand amen let me
[1:49:46] tell you what that is that ain't nothing
[1:49:47] but a devil of fear and fear is
[1:49:49] trespassed long enough I'll say Satan

[1:49:55] me and I assure thee in the name of
[1:49:57] Jesus
[1:49:58] I bring every Spirit under my control to
[1:50:02] declare the word of God and by declaring
[1:50:04] the word of God I am rebuking the spirit
[1:50:06] of fear some of you all right now want
[1:50:08] to say Amen but there's a spirit of fear
[1:50:10] on you to utter the word amen you want
[1:50:13] to Rejoice so bad but there's a spirit
[1:50:15] of fear on you Amen to release yourself

[1:51:17] of the sound mind you say preacher
[1:51:18] you're getting over an adoption well I
[1:51:20] am because the word is the adoption that

[1:51:30] I really the prophet said there he died

[1:52:22] my license to preach the liberty of
[1:52:25] Divine Healing and to declare that if I

[1:52:30] his hands on you under a Divine

[1:52:42] defeated every torment and Gable of Hell
[1:52:44] or a tumor is defeated every condition

[1:52:50] I have been liberated to believe in
[1:52:53] March 16 is an action and it's here

[1:53:07] fear back in here he's defeated
[1:53:09] [Applause]
[1:53:10] [Music]
[1:53:12] I know where I'm standing it's a spirit
[1:53:14] of fear probably God said the greatest
[1:53:17] weapon was ever put in the hands of man
[1:53:18] is the Bible
[1:53:20] to be backed up for the holy ghost that
[1:53:23] Christ died at Calvary
[1:53:25] to free his church from Superstition and
[1:53:29] fear and doubt and trembling
[1:53:31] if you're trembling you're not free if
[1:53:34] you're following Superstition you're not
[1:53:36] free if you've got fear on your life
[1:53:38] you're not free but Jesus Christ the son
[1:53:41] of God died at Calvary to declare
[1:53:44] Freedom through Adam's pollen race
[1:53:49] he lives today
[1:53:51] he lives today if he lives today then
[1:53:54] fear ought to be dead if he lives today
[1:53:57] Superstition ought to be dead if he come
[1:54:00] on church if he lives today down ought
[1:54:03] to be dead he lives today he rose from
[1:54:06] the dead He's Alive Tonight here ye him
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:16] unless somebody will declare it how can
[1:54:18] you see unless somebody will declare how
[1:54:21] can you get free unless somebody will
[1:54:24] quit being a coward and preach the
[1:54:26] message of the hour
[1:54:28] how can our young people know that
[1:54:30] they're saying about your argument it's
[1:54:32] a reality unless somebody shut up the
[1:54:34] argument and get back to preaching the
[1:54:36] message and remember who we are what
[1:54:39] we're here for
[1:54:41] listen if I wanted to sit around arguing
[1:54:43] present time I'd go join a Baptist
[1:54:45] Council and we can do it every Monday
[1:54:47] morning but I'm not a Baptist I'm a
[1:54:49] seated Abraham and I am out of the
[1:54:51] license to believe God
[1:54:53] some of y'all say what do you talk about
[1:54:55] pleasure I'm talking about fussing with
[1:54:57] that devil that ought to be underneath
[1:54:58] your feet
[1:55:01] some of y'all give that devil management
[1:55:03] and that devil ought to be under your
[1:55:05] feet
[1:55:07] devil ought to be under your foot right
[1:55:09] now and you're letting him in your mind
[1:55:10] you're letting him tell you well if I do
[1:55:12] this this is going to happen and if I
[1:55:14] say that that's going to happen that is
[1:55:16] a devil from the prince of hell and I
[1:55:18] resent you Satan in the name of Jesus
[1:55:21] Christ Thou Art defeated
[1:55:27] [Applause]
[1:55:29] he has no rights in the house of God
[1:55:31] because Jesus Christ he lives today he
[1:55:36] rose from the dead He's Alive tonight
[1:55:38] and he sent me here on a Saturday night
[1:55:41] in the middle of Pawnee Oklahoma to
[1:55:43] declare unto you that God is the way the
[1:55:46] truth and the life he's the power and
[1:55:48] the Deliverance he's the power and the

[1:55:58] Wars shall we fear is a spirit of
[1:56:01] intimidation and manipulation I told you
[1:56:03] never you better not show up fear is a
[1:56:06] spirit of intimidation and it's a spirit
[1:56:08] of manipulation and you know what fear
[1:56:10] will do fear will intimidate you and
[1:56:13] then it'll manipulate you
[1:56:15] fear will intimidate you and it will
[1:56:17] manipulate you you say preacher you're
[1:56:19] crazy am I really let's look at covet
[1:56:21] shall we for a minute let's look at
[1:56:23] Coleman I'm not here to argue with you
[1:56:24] about whether you believe it or not
[1:56:26] let's just look at it for a second do
[1:56:28] you realize what happened it was a fear
[1:56:30] that broke out say with me now it was a
[1:56:32] fear that broke out and somebody got on
[1:56:34] the Airways and somebody said oh there's
[1:56:37] somehow
[1:56:40] virus and it's a deadly virus and we
[1:56:42] don't now patch amen but I just want to
[1:56:44] say this is a preacher I know people
[1:56:46] that died from covet I know people too
[1:56:48] but let me go into that devil he lost
[1:56:50] and they won
[1:56:53] Kobe did not win
[1:56:55] it did win the first time they tried it
[1:56:58] and if they tried again it won't win if
[1:57:00] they try every election between now and
[1:57:02] they'll come in the Lord it will never
[1:57:04] shut this right up it's a demon of fear
[1:57:08] now y'all know I'm telling the truth and
[1:57:10] some of some of what we're dealing with
[1:57:12] right now is side effects of a spirit of
[1:57:14] fear that moved into homes moved into
[1:57:17] churches moved into families
[1:57:20] why it's a spirit of fear it's got
[1:57:22] people now y'all know I'm telling the
[1:57:24] truth oh God can I preach by the window
[1:57:27] amen it's a spirit of intimidation so
[1:57:29] brother Sean they say if you go out
[1:57:31] you're going to catch it if you go to
[1:57:32] church you're going to catch it if you
[1:57:34] go to the wherever you go amen but but
[1:57:36] what did he do it changed the way people
[1:57:38] lived so it did not just intimidate for
[1:57:41] him it began to manipulate him listen
[1:57:43] you never went to Walmart with Thor mask
[1:57:45] on your face until intimidation come
[1:57:48] around come on you didn't well I know I
[1:57:51] didn't just laugh at me in this and then
[1:57:53] I didn't put turmax in all my cars amen
[1:57:55] before
[1:57:56] [Applause]
[1:57:59] but it's the truth now you say whatever
[1:58:01] Andrew I'm just more spiritually well
[1:58:03] maybe you are and God bless you but
[1:58:04] we're here today and we're defeating
[1:58:06] that fear
[1:58:10] some of y'all never stood out on the
[1:58:12] front porch and washed your vegetables
[1:58:13] before you brought them in you never
[1:58:15] went out there and sprayed Lysol on your
[1:58:17] bags from Walmart until a spirit of fear
[1:58:20] was released in this nation and it began
[1:58:22] to intimidate you and before long it
[1:58:25] began to manipulate
[1:58:26] well we might as well preach in Saturday
[1:58:29] night and I feel like cutting some
[1:58:30] Devil's heads off it's a spirit of fear
[1:58:36] so that was a natural spirit of fear but
[1:58:38] let's look at another spirit of fear in
[1:58:39] the last days is trying to manipulate
[1:58:41] the way we have our meetings come on it
[1:58:44] used to be we showed up and we didn't
[1:58:46] care who shouted who danced who had a
[1:58:48] prayer line who rejoiced in the Holy
[1:58:50] Ghost we didn't care what happened we
[1:58:52] was just happy to be there but some old
[1:58:54] long tongue devil called up out of the
[1:58:57] piss of hell and begin to spew his voice
[1:58:59] just breath out on the church and say
[1:59:01] well if we're not careful amen things
[1:59:03] are going to get out of hand and if
[1:59:04] we're not careful somebody might go
[1:59:06] through far let me tell you what that is
[1:59:08] that's a demon from the pits of hell
[1:59:12] it's a spirit of fear and I refuse to
[1:59:14] back up to it I used to lay my Bible
[1:59:17] down and let some devil let's crawl out
[1:59:20] of hell manipulate our meetings I refuse
[1:59:23] to let some devil manipulate our prayer
[1:59:25] lines I refuse for that Sun Devil
[1:59:28] manipulate these men of God that have
[1:59:30] given their lives to preach this gospel
[1:59:32] I may not be nobody and I know it but as
[1:59:35] long as I got a breath in my body and a
[1:59:37] bone in my body I'm going to declare war

[1:59:59] of fear and I refuse I refuse I refuse
[2:00:03] you where you are too too you all
[2:00:05] refused to come to a meeting and not say
[2:00:07] Amen because of what somebody gonna say

[2:04:01] more young men that there's a God who

[2:04:05] as a God who can rescue you
[2:04:11] what about it Church what about it
[2:04:13] there's a living God and that devil will

[2:04:29] oh God
[2:04:32] we need you we need men of God
[2:04:38] declare this message
[2:04:39] [Applause]
[2:04:43] well I think that devil got out of here
[2:04:46] couldn't stop us from preaching but now
[2:04:48] he changes he tactic and says well Don't
[2:04:51] Preach everything
[2:04:53] just preach certain parts you know
[2:04:55] because because if you're not careful
[2:04:57] you're gonna you're gonna get off the
[2:04:59] middle of the road you're gonna get in
[2:05:01] the ditching oh listen here you devil of
[2:05:03] fear
[2:05:05] fear is of the devil
[2:05:08] God don't want you to fear he wants you
[2:05:11] to believe
[2:05:12] you say why are you preaching this
[2:05:13] because the word rebukes the fear
[2:05:18] if I don't push back with a word the
[2:05:20] fear will take over
[2:05:22] but the word rebukes the fear see
[2:05:25] remember sitting now watch he goes to
[2:05:27] Isaac can I have a few more minutes
[2:05:29] he goes to Isaiah 35 verse 8 and he says
[2:05:32] in a highway shall be there
[2:05:35] and away and it shall be called the way
[2:05:38] of holiness the unclean shall not pass
[2:05:41] over it but it shall be for those the
[2:05:44] wayfared man the fools shall not air
[2:05:47] therein now I'm going to take time and
[2:05:48] preach this to you the prophet of God
[2:05:50] said Isaiah said there would be a
[2:05:52] highway and Away conjunction it won't be
[2:05:55] called The Highway of Holiness it'll be
[2:05:57] called the way of Holiness see right in
[2:06:00] the middle of the road I'm still on my
[2:06:02] subject Liberty to declare another place
[2:06:05] you said and then when the rain comes it
[2:06:08] washes all the trash off on the side so
[2:06:11] if we're in the middle of the road and
[2:06:12] for the Leon brother Leo sorry some
[2:06:15] trash gets in the middle of the road we
[2:06:16] don't have to worry about getting it out
[2:06:18] ourselves when the rain falls the rain
[2:06:22] will wash the trash off and we'll just
[2:06:25] keep moving forward
[2:06:27] see that's the beauty of preaching the
[2:06:29] message is the word corrects the error
[2:06:31] so when the air shows up in the middle
[2:06:34] of the road we don't quit walking and
[2:06:36] focus on the air we just keep our eyes
[2:06:38] on the cross of Calvary and we just keep
[2:06:40] on walking because before long some
[2:06:42] rain's going to fall and when that rain
[2:06:45] falls it's going to rush all the trash
[2:06:47] off
[2:06:50] now y'all know I'm preaching the truth
[2:06:52] he says another place for ways in the
[2:06:54] middle of the road each side is where
[2:06:56] the all falls is found all falls isn't
[2:06:58] that something John all false and then
[2:07:00] that's where you're one this brother
[2:07:01] went to one side and you're trying to
[2:07:03] tan with the other side but the true
[2:07:04] message lays in the center of the road
[2:07:07] the true message is laid in the center
[2:07:10] so we don't have to go to the ditch to
[2:07:13] find it and pull it to the center it's
[2:07:15] already in the center
[2:07:18] the true message is this okay the true
[2:07:22] message not your message my message
[2:07:24] brother so and trust me but the true
[2:07:27] message lays in the center of the road
[2:07:29] another place in 1962 but now in the
[2:07:33] middle of the road in the scriptures
[2:07:35] lays out the truth you see where you're
[2:07:37] at amen the angel Lord and the another
[2:07:39] place and the Hours come when the
[2:07:41] American now let me back up I just
[2:07:44] identified to you we're the angel of the
[2:07:46] Lord is he's in the center
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:50] well listen in the message he's in the
[2:07:53] center of the road
[2:07:55] I'm going somewhere he said now watch
[2:07:57] either some kind of fantastic or
[2:07:59] something isn't so cold starchy listen
[2:08:01] there's two classes he said hardly a
[2:08:04] middle of the road anymore
[2:08:05] oh can I keep on going
[2:08:09] 1959 well you know I always preach the
[2:08:13] middle of the road
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:16] I always preach the minute so if you'll
[2:08:19] study what brother bam said and you'll
[2:08:21] just say it we don't have to worry about
[2:08:23] it if you're in the middle you're
[2:08:24] already in the middle just by saying
[2:08:26] what he said because every tape he's
[2:08:28] preaching is in the middle of the road
[2:08:31] in 47 55 52 61 63 come on just say what
[2:08:39] a prophet said and you'll automatically
[2:08:41] stay in the middle of the road
[2:08:45] you know I always somebody say always I
[2:08:49] always preach the middle of the road you
[2:08:52] know what I say brother Jonas I say
[2:08:54] thank God for prophetic teaching I say
[2:08:56] thank God for Prophet who always whether
[2:08:59] he was with the Oneness or the Tunis if
[2:09:02] he was with the freeness or if he was
[2:09:03] with the Full Gospel if he was with Jack
[2:09:06] Moore or he was with both but come on
[2:09:08] Sir if he would be Joseph Mo say
[2:09:10] wherever a prophet was he was preaching
[2:09:13] in the middle of the road because there
[2:09:15] was a bride that was going to follow
[2:09:17] this road she was going to walk the same
[2:09:19] path and she couldn't get in the ditch
[2:09:21] she had to stay
[2:09:24] hey you know I'm going somewhere amen
[2:09:27] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[2:09:29] thank God for a prophet who preached the
[2:09:31] middle of the road even when he was
[2:09:33] being made fun of
[2:09:34] [Applause]
[2:09:36] with his own cousin brother Jonathan in
[2:09:39] Evansville Indiana said we heard brother
[2:09:40] Brown and preaching the middle of the
[2:09:42] road the other day
[2:09:44] you know what that guy said he said talk
[2:09:46] about preaching me on the road he said
[2:09:48] that's not good driving ethics
[2:09:51] that's not good driving ethics well last
[2:09:53] time I checked oh God
[2:09:56] last time I checked it's a one-way Road
[2:09:58] [Applause]
[2:10:00] it ain't a coming and a going it's one
[2:10:03] way
[2:10:07] you can't preach this message by
[2:10:09] laodicea's Road directions you can't
[2:10:12] preach this message by the Baptist idea
[2:10:15] they've been on the road turning coming
[2:10:16] they've made so many u-turns we're
[2:10:18] plumbed is it but thank God for a
[2:10:20] prophet who centered the gospel in the
[2:10:23] middle of the road and he got him a car
[2:10:25] and he began to preach it if they
[2:10:27] laughed gave me preaching if they made
[2:10:29] fun of me preaching you know what I say
[2:10:31] brother Tim I say if he could be
[2:10:32] criticized and stay in the middle of the
[2:10:34] road you better believe you can laugh at
[2:10:36] me make fun of me call me what you want
[2:10:38] to but I'm Gonna Stand where I Prophet
[2:10:41] stood I'm going to stand in the middle
[2:10:43] of the road and declare that Jesus
[2:10:46] Christ
[2:10:48] is right here
[2:10:54] well I'm feeling good and that Devil's
[2:10:56] that Devil's feeling bad and I'm feeling
[2:10:58] good
[2:11:02] bad driving ethics well let me just keep
[2:11:04] on preaching for a second have you
[2:11:06] forgot we're not being driven we're
[2:11:07] being led
[2:11:09] [Applause]
[2:11:11] have you forgot we're not being driven
[2:11:13] we're being led
[2:11:14] his brother his brother Duran here

[2:11:18] probably listen at home we had some
[2:11:20] brother Sean's living room one day and I
[2:11:22] never forget brother Sean brother Darren
[2:11:24] just spoke up and he said there's one
[2:11:25] way to identify Spirit he said it's the
[2:11:28] spirit of God it leads he said if it's a
[2:11:31] wrong Spirit it drives
[2:11:33] I got my phone out I put that note in my
[2:11:35] phone that's how I identify spirit is it
[2:11:38] lead me to do something or is it driving
[2:11:40] me to do something
[2:11:41] see if it's driving your shout it ain't
[2:11:44] coming from the spirit of God if it's
[2:11:45] dry come on church if it's driving you
[2:11:48] to do certain things it ain't coming
[2:11:50] from the spirit if it's driving you not
[2:11:51] to say Amen it's not coming from the
[2:11:53] spirit of God but if it's leading you
[2:11:56] well I feel good if it's leading you
[2:12:00] then there's liberty you say preach the
[2:12:02] lottery standing on the road because the
[2:12:04] only place Liberty can be found is in
[2:12:07] the middle of the road
[2:12:08] [Applause]
[2:12:10] you don't believe me let's go to the
[2:12:11] formal okay get over in the formal
[2:12:14] ditch and you can't shout you can't
[2:12:16] raise your hands you can't say Amen you
[2:12:19] can't dance if you cry you're too
[2:12:20] emotional if you snatch or two out of
[2:12:22] order amen there's all kinds of bondage
[2:12:25] well let's leave that side and let's go
[2:12:27] to the fanatical side if you ain't
[2:12:29] screaming running hollering shout amen
[2:12:31] you're out of the Earth but if you come
[2:12:33] to the middle of the road
[2:12:35] come over where the angel the Lord is if
[2:12:37] you come over the spirit of God is the
[2:12:40] proud of God said this he sent a Sweet
[2:12:42] Holy Spirit leads to church he said now
[2:12:44] what made the difference we just started
[2:12:46] getting a little arrogant
[2:12:49] oh God just starting to get little
[2:12:52] arrogant and different in our churches
[2:12:54] and the devil flew away he said but
[2:12:57] right in the middle of the road there's
[2:12:59] a true sound unadulterated gospel and
[2:13:02] the power of God right down to there
[2:13:04] taking the Kings and monarchs where
[2:13:07] anybody can stand in Search and they can
[2:13:10] see that it's the power of the almighty
[2:13:12] God not a fanaticism not a formality
[2:13:15] it's the power of God then why did Paul
[2:13:18] declare the demonstration of the spirit
[2:13:21] because theirs were the power of God is
[2:13:23] is not an enticing words it's not in
[2:13:27] man's directions the power of God is in
[2:13:30] the faith of God now I'm hurrying along
[2:13:32] I've got to close he said friends I've
[2:13:34] always listen to The Prophet I've always
[2:13:36] tried to keep a balance on the road but
[2:13:38] there's a middle of the road where the
[2:13:39] true sound same gospels priests and God
[2:13:42] moves in there don't you thank God now
[2:13:45] now somebody say well preacher why why
[2:13:47] are you so driving this point because
[2:13:49] the preacher the message is the adoption
[2:13:52] of the church
[2:13:55] can we agree with that the message of
[2:13:57] the hour
[2:13:59] is this okay
[2:14:01] the message of the hour is the adoption
[2:14:04] of the church probably God said the four
[2:14:06] gospel church is divided in two ways one
[2:14:08] of them is getting cold formal danger
[2:14:10] line next one getting a bunch of Mystic
[2:14:12] here in high things not even scripture
[2:14:13] stay right in the middle of the road see
[2:14:16] now you say preacher why he said because
[2:14:18] what you don't get on either side or
[2:14:21] your adoption will leave
[2:14:25] direct quote if you get on either side
[2:14:28] your adoption will leave and you'll
[2:14:30] revert back to a bunch of Pentecostals
[2:14:32] hollering the name Jesus without no
[2:14:35] manifestation because the authority of
[2:14:37] the name of God is in the adoption the
[2:14:39] church by the word of God let me just go
[2:14:42] ahead and move on and say this I'm going
[2:14:44] to stay in the middle of the road
[2:14:46] you know why I'm gonna stand in the
[2:14:48] Middle Road because I study a prophet
[2:14:50] and I found out if powerful things
[2:14:52] happen in the middle of the road you
[2:14:55] know I found out brother window I found
[2:14:56] out powerful things happen in the middle
[2:14:59] of the road you say really yes sir look

[2:15:09] jumped out there in the middle of the
[2:15:11] road under this knowing he was a child

[2:15:36] is in the middle of the road
[2:15:38] you say really yeah you realize blind
[2:15:40] Bartimaeus the prophet of God said he
[2:15:42] was in the middle of the road and his
[2:15:45] faith stopped Jesus Ryan Bartimaeus was
[2:15:49] in the middle of the road and his faith
[2:15:51] stopped Jesus I'm going to tell you why
