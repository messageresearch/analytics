So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. Because thy loving kindness is better than life. My lips shall praise me. Thus will I bless thee while I live. I will lift up my hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied with m marorrow and fatness. And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches.

And I do uh want to uh say to uh to the all the brothers uh that uh uh worked yesterday. Amen. It's a little cold in the morning. At least it was for this old man. Amen. I had to bundle up a little bit. But uh you now have a brand new uh water heater at the fellowship hall. It's right there by your the kitchen part in that in that old furnace closet. So, shouldn't take very long for that hot water to get to that sink. Amen. We might even wash some dishes now. &gt;&gt; I take that back. How'd that slip out? Amen. And then uh we also put in uh a brand new uh heating and air conditioning unit at the fellowship hall yesterday. The these brothers pushed me real hard, Nick. They pushed me to what? &gt;&gt; Well, we'll work on that. But uh so uh it's working. Everything's working fine. I I I checked it last night and it's just it was really toasty in there. Brother uh Michael put it on uh uh on 74 degrees and just uh kind of burn off that new smell that you get and uh and I went back by there a few hours later and it was already up to 74 degrees and the furnace was was already kicked off. And so I turned her back down to 68 just to just to save money like I like I like I try to do. But uh we sure appreciate all the uh all you brothers for all all that you did and save the saves the church a lot of money cuz we don't we don't have that much money. Uh and if you didn't know it I'm the treasurer. So if you if you if there's something you can do for the church, uh I tell you what, I I I collect aluminum cans just to recycle. I just something to do, you know. I think brother Steve Karen, y'all still do that? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You do a lot of recycling. Yeah. I uh I have hundreds of pounds of aluminum I need to uh I need to put uh take to the recycling center and uh Lord laid that on my heart uh to give that to missions and evangelistic uh kind of an offering. So uh pray the Lord will bless that and uh Amen. So not not no harm in recycling. Amen. So there's uh they say there's hundreds and hundreds of tons of of uh trash out on our oceans and rivers and lakes and Amen. And we see it on the side of the road every day and I you know I threw out a bottle one time as a teenager and my cousin goes, "Why did you do that?" I don't know. Just just throwing out a bottle on the side of the road. That's littering. You shouldn't do that. Well, I got convicted. I got con convicted like, you know, you're right. You're right. So, I changed my ways and so young people don't litter. Now, I think there's a scripture something about those that destroy the earth, God will destroy. So, I know that littering seems like a little small thing, but it adds up. Brother Mitch. Amen. Just like every aluminum can I I keep it is it adds up doesn't it brother Steve Sister Karen. So Amen. But anything you can do for God God will bless you and reward you for it. Amen. Time many times over. So Amen. Just think about that this morning. Well, how many is ready for the word of the Lord? Amen. We appreciate brother Kobe and his ministry and just all of our ministers. And uh so let's get behind brother Kobe this morning. And as I promised, I want to sing that song that brother Rundle was talking about faith and Amen. And uh and uh I believe we uh uh people got some faith Wednesday night. How many enjoyed the service Wednesday night and people found the Lord and got delivered and set free and that's what it's all about is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. Who the sun sets free is free indeed. Amen. And as brother Kobe comes, let's just sing this old chorus. Have faith in God. Amen. Oh, have faith in God. Just have faith in God. Oh, it's been a while. Oh, have faith in God for the answer. Have faith in God. Oh, have faith in God. Oh, have faith in God. Oh, have faith in God for the answer. Have faith. Without faith, it's impossible to please God. But he'll give it to you this morning if you ask. So, let's have faith in God. Oh, come in for the answer. Amen. Oh morning, I see you in the sunrise every morning. It's like a picture that you paint it for me. A love letter in the sky. Oh, story. I could have had a really different story, but you stepped down from heaven to restore. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Forever change my life. Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus. I'll stand in all of your amazing ways. I worship you as long as I am breathing. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Nobody loves me like you. Amen. Oh, mountains, you're breaking down the weight of every mountain. Even when it feels like I'm surrounded. Yes, Lord. You never leave my side. Are you thankful for that? Here this morning, nobody loves me. Nobody loves me like you love me. Jesus, I stand in all of your amazing ways. I worship you as long as I am breathing. God, you are faithful and true. Nobody loves me like you. Hallelujah. Can you say amen to that here this morning? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm so glad that his mercies are are new every morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that his love is is never changing. that it's so glad the Lord doesn't go through mood swings. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So glad he's he's he's never failing. He's always loving us when we're been unlovable and he's never never forsaken us. Amen. I'm so glad for that here this morning. And God bless you. I'd like to turn to Isaiah 63. Want to say it is good to see brother Luke back with us here this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Last time I seen him, he uh just got out of surgery and he was a little high. So, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. It really is good to see him here this morning. Amen. Amen. Isaiah 63 and verse 7. We got a few passages of scripture, so we'll read this and let you be seated. But Isaiah 63 and7 it says, "I will mention the loving kindness of the Lord and the praises of the Lord according to all that the Lord has bestowed on us and the greatness uh the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he has bestowed upon them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his loving kindness. For he has said, "Surely they are my people, children that will not lie." So he was their savior and in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them and in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bured them and carried them all the days of old. Heavenly Father, how we love you here this morning, Lord. And we're so thankful for your presence that we feel here today. And father, I'm asking that you'll continue to be with us here, Lord, in this remaining part of this service. Lord, touch all the ones that ain't feeling well. I know brother Michael is not feeling good this morning, Lord. I I pray that you just touch him and strengthen him here this morning. Father, anyone else that's afflicted in their mind, in their body, Lord, just be with us here for the remaining part of this service. In your name we pray. Amen. And amen. Can we turn? You may be seated here this morning. Can we turn to Psalms 145 and verse one? Psalms 145 and verse one. Amen. Telling brother Michael, you know, this is going to be just a like a Bible study here this morning. I I leave the the deep preaching to them. So, if you heard this before, just bear with me. Amen. Psalms 145 and verse one. It says, "I will extol thee, oh God, my God, oh king. I will bless thy name forever and ever. Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name forever and ever. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised. And his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts, and I will declare thy greatness. Amen. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. I love this. The Lord is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works. One more passage of scripture. Lamentations 3 and verse 22. Lamentations 3 and verse 22. Amen. It says, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions faileth not. They are new every morning." Amen. Great is thy faithfulness. And if I had a very simple title, I won't keep you too long this morning. It would be his mercies are are new every morning. And I begin to think about this this title or this this uh topic this past week and begin to think of how good God has been &gt;&gt; to every one of us and the mercies that he continually shows us every day. Right. &gt;&gt; It's it's as we've been hearing through the messages, uh, his his mercies are not are not given to us based on how good we are. And it based on if we fail him or if we make a mistake. But his mercies, thank God, are new. Every morning, every day you get up out of bed, there's a new mercy there for you. You're you're you're not you're not going into a new day with with yesterday's problems. But God's mercy is is is is unfathomable. It's it's something that never gets old. Amen. And we see that God didn't let you wake up this morning because you were perfect. Amen. How many perfect people do we have this morning? We're not perfect, but God let you wake up because he's merciful. And if you open your eyes this morning, IT'S PROOF THAT GOD IS NOT DONE WITH you yet. Amen. And God has not given up on you. And God's mercy is is still working in your life here this morning. And we begin to see that we're here today because of the mercy of God. It's it's God's mercy that you have a sound mind this morning. IT'S IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT OUT OF the 8 million people that's on the face OF THE EARTH. GOD ALLOWED YOU TO BE HERE. And he allowed you to hear the greatest message that's ever hit planet Earth. IT'S IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT HE ALLOWED YOU NOT TO JUST HEAR IT, BUT TO ACCEPT IT IN YOUR HEART AND RECEIVE IT. THAT'S GOD'S MERCY. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT HAS HEARD THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; BUT HAS NOT HAD A HEART TO ACCEPT IT AND RECEIVE IT. BUT YOU'RE HERE THIS MORNING BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S MERCY UPON YOUR LIFE. NOT BY YOUR MERITS AND NOT BY WHAT YOU'VE DONE, BUT IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT YOU'VE HEARD IT AND YOU'VE ACCEPTED AND RECEIVED THE GREATEST MESSAGE THAT'S OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; We have over a little over 8 million people on the face of the earth and here you sit this morning. &gt;&gt; It's God's mercy to you. I know it's going TO BE VERY SIMPLE, BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD GOD IS TO YOU THIS MORNING. IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT that we're here with with with with healing IN OUR BODY. AND IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE, AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE THE THRONE WITH BOLDNESS. It's mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to look at this scripture that we just read in Lamentations. And Jeremiah was writing this in the midst of destruction. We begin to see that the city was burned and the temple was destroyed. The nation WAS BEING JUDGED. YET IN ALL OF THAT, JEREMIAH CAN SAY, "GOD IS STILL MERCIFUL." HE CAN SAY, "GOD IS STILL FAITHFUL AND GOD IS STILL GOOD." AND NO MATTER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS MORNING, &gt;&gt; God's mercy will always be there for you. &gt;&gt; MERCY IS NOT BASED ON ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT IT'S BASED UPON THE CHARACTER OF GOD. IT'S THE LORD'S MERCIES THAT WERE not consumed, &gt;&gt; but it is new every morning. NOW WE SEE THAT GOD REVEALS HIS MERCY WHEN life looks the worst, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; But this word consumed, it means to be destroyed or or outtaken, wiped out, lost, AND BEYOND REPAIR. SO WHY SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN CONSUMED? Let's look on that for just a minute. We should have been consumed by sin. WE DIDN'T JUST SLIP, BUT WE FELL HARD, H, didn't we? &gt;&gt; All right, BROTHER. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY LIFE'S PRESSURES. Some of those storms that we have BEEN THROUGH SHOULD HAVE CRUSHED YOU. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Are you with ME THIS MORNING? THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE DEVOURED YOU IF IF GOD WOULD HAVE ALLOWED IT. &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY YOUR PAST. AMEN. SHAME SHOULD HAVE EATEN YOU ALIVE HERE THIS MORNING. THINK ABOUT IT. THINKING ABOUT YOUR PAST, HOW HOW IT CAN DRIVE YOU CRAZY AND DRIVE YOU MAD, BUT YOU'RE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING WITH YOUR PAST FORGIVEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY YOUR CONSEQUENCES THAT THE CHOICES that we've made. IT SHOULD HAVE HAD YOU IN AN EMPTY GRAVE. &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY BLOCKED IT. MERCY STEPPED IN WHEN YOU WERE WEAK. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WERE WRONG, WHEN YOU WERE REBELLIOUS, WHEN YOU WERE ROTTED, WHEN YOU WERE TIRED, AND WHEN YOU WERE BROKEN. MERCY NEVER GETS TIRED. &gt;&gt; MERCY NEVER GETS WEARY. EVEN THOUGH IN OUR MIND, WE MAY SEEM JUST LIKE WE'RE GOING TO FALL UNDER THE STRAIN. MERCY NEVER GETS OVERWHELMED. &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY IS THERE TO PICK YOU UP IN YOUR LOWEST TIMES. &gt;&gt; It's mercy. YEAH, &gt;&gt; I CAN PREACH ABOUT MERCY THIS MORNING BECAUSE I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT MERCY. &gt;&gt; I'VE HAD A PAST. I WAS RUNNING FROM GOD, BUT IT WAS MERCY THAT LED ME RIGHT BACK TO HERE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; It's God's mercy. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS MERCY HERE THIS MORNING? MERCY IS GOD WITHHOLDING WHAT YOU DO DESERVE. &gt;&gt; MERCY IS GOD PROTECTING YOU FROM JUDGMENT. MERCY IS GOD KEEPING YOU FROM YOUR OWN DESTRUCTION. &gt;&gt; MERCY IS GOD STOPPING THE CONSEQUENCES FROM HITTING YOU FULL FORCE. &gt;&gt; MERCY IS GOD COVERING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU FALL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. MERCY IS GOD SAYING, "NO, THEY BELONG TO ME." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; MERCY IS THE ONLY REASON YOU SURVIVED THE CAR ACCIDENTS. &gt;&gt; MERCY IS THE ONLY REASON YOU HAVEN'T LOST YOUR MIND OR OR DIED IN SIN. MERCY IS THE REASON THAT ADDICTION DIDN'T DESTROY YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT YOU'RE NOT A DRUNK IN A BAR SOMEWHERE OR OR STRUNG OUT ON DRUGS LIKE YOU WERE. IT'S MERCY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T DESERVE GOD'S GRACE AND LOVE, BUT MERCY IS STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND DESTRUCTION. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I hope you can get what I'm saying this morning. Brother Brandham says, "That's it. It isn't whether I can hang on or not. It isn't whether I CAN HOLD OUT. IT'S WHETHER HE holds out. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that I CAN DO. IT'S WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME. &gt;&gt; What Christ has DONE FOR ME IN GOD. THAT'S THE REASON I'm saved today. YES, SIR. NOT BY WHAT I CAN DO. NOT BY GOOD WORKS ARE WE SAVED, BUT BY HIS MERCIES. Oh my. God has saved us in Christ unconditionally. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, Colby, why did we need mercy?" Romans 3 and 23 says, "All have sinned." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; GOOD POINT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF SIN, WE DESERVED DEATH, JUDGMENT, SEPARATION. We deserved punishment. WE DESERVE TO GO TO A DEVIL'S HELL. IT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; I know you've heard this before, but it's IT'S TRUE. BUT GOD STEPS IN THROUGH MERCY AND SAYS, "I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU." THAT'S MERCY. IF WE COULD JUST STOP AND SEE WHERE GOD HAS BROUGHT US FROM. &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD BE LIKE THE 8 MILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT IS STILL STUCK IN THEIR CONDITIONS. &gt;&gt; THAT HAS HAD AN EAR TO HEAR IT BUT NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT IT, REJECT IT, REFUSED IT. BUT MERCY ALLOWED YOU TO BE HERE THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF GOD'S LOVE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But we can see mercy all throughout the scripture. Adam and Eve, mercy covered their shame. GOD COULD HAVE KILLED THEM. HALLELUJAH. BUT AS THEY WERE WALKING OUT, HE SLEW A LAMB AND HE CLOTHED THEM WITH THAT BLOOD. THAT'S MERCY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, &gt;&gt; NOAH. MERCY MADE A WAY OF ESCAPE. GOD SAVING his household because mercy intervenes before judgment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. We can see David and how mercy spared a man who failed badly. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT A MAN IN THE BIBLE THAT had mistakes, it was David. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; sure. &gt;&gt; HE DID SIN, &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY restored him again. &gt;&gt; We see Jonah, mercy gave him a second chance, &gt;&gt; RUNNING FROM GOD ON HIS WAY, HALLELUJAH, to Tarsus. &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY RAN AFTER HIM. WE CAN WE CAN ALL RELATE WITH JONAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; HOW WE WERE RUNNING THE OPPOSITE WAY. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS MERCY THAT BROUGHT US BACK AGAIN. YOU MAY HAVE RAN and you MAY HAVE RAN AND YOU MAY HAVE DONE SOME THINGS IN YOUR LIFE, BUT MERCY NEVER LET YOU GO. IT WAS MERCY THAT RESTORED YOU BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Peter, mercy restored a denier. We see him. HE HE DENIED CHRIST THREE TIMES PUBLICLY. AND the next thing we see is Peter fishing naked on a boat. &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY BROUGHT HIM BACK AGAIN. JESUS TELLS MARY, "GO TELL MY DISCIPLES." OH, and Peter. &gt;&gt; AND PETER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JUST BECAUSE YOU FAIL GOD DOESN'T MEAN THAT GOD FORGETS ABOUT YOU. JUST BECAUSE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE AND YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT MISTAKE, THE DEVIL WILL COME IN AND TELL YOU THAT THAT GOD HAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU. THAT GOD WILL FORSAKE YOU BECAUSE YOU MESSED UP. YOU MADE A MISTAKE. REMEMBER, GOD IS NOT MOODY. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR MISTAKE, BUT GOD BRINGS YOU BACK INTO HIS LOVING ARMS AGAIN. THAT'S MERCY. &gt;&gt; Oh my. MERCY IS WHAT HAS KEPT YOU ALIVE TODAY. Oh my. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Kobe, I got a past." We all got pasts. &gt;&gt; We're not perfect here this morning. We've made mistakes, but it's God's mercy that can wipe you clean again. &gt;&gt; It's God's GRACE AND HIS BLOOD THAT HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE AND HAS TAKEN THE VERY SCENT OF SIN out of your life. &gt;&gt; It's mercy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. We see here judgment says you deserve punishment. Mercy said I took the punishment FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; JUDGMENT SAYS YOU ARE GUILTY. AND IT'S TRUE. BUT MERCY SAYS YOU ARE FORGIVEN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; MERCY TRIUMPHS OVER judgment every time. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE DEVIL TRIES TO BRING UP THE PAST, REMIND HIM OF WHAT GOD DID FOR YOU ON CALVARY 2,000 YEARS AGO, REMIND HIM THAT THE BLOOD NEVER LOSES ITS POWER. NO MATTER HOW STRONG THE CHAINS OF THE ENEMY MAY BE UPON YOUR LIFE, REMEMBER THE BLOOD BREAKS EVERY SHACKLE. THIS MORNING, &gt;&gt; we've had some deliverances TAKE PLACE WEDNESDAY. DON'T LET THE DEVIL TELL you that this is that that is is is JUST SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU JUST WENT THROUGH. YOU'LL FALL BACK INTO YOUR SIN AGAIN. THE BLOOD COVERS THE MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE FREE, STAY FREE HERE THIS MORNING. DON'T LET THE DEVIL TAKE BACK WHAT THE GOD TOOK FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TRUE, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; But mercy, it protects you. Hallelujah. You have no DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY times the enemy has tried to kill you in your sleep but mercy said no. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY TIMES YOUR MISTAKE SHOULD HAVE DESTROYED your your your future but mercy stepped in. I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; How many times YOU SHOULD HAVE LOST EVERYTHING BUT mercy protected you here this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God shows you mercy in the darkest of moments. We see that Jeremiah was preaching mercy while standing in the ruins. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the clearest view of mercy is not on the mountain, but it's when you're in the rubble. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE NOT ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP, BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE VALLEY. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; EVEN WHEN YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM. OH MY. THERE'S MERCY AT THE BOTTOM WAITING for you there. MERCY IS THERE TO PICK YOU BACK UP AND PUT YOU BACK ON THE PATH. THAT'S WHAT MERCY IS FOR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Now that we understand mercy, is this okay this morning? &gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT GOD'S NEW mercy does in your life every single morning. &gt;&gt; Because we understand that mercy is new. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Every morning, every sunrise is God saying, "Try again." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Start over. &gt;&gt; You've been forgiven. Oh my. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT FINISHED. YOU'RE STILL MINE. EVERY TIME THE SUN RISES UP AND YOU STILL GOT A SOUND MIND. You ought to thank God for that. &gt;&gt; EVERY TIME THAT SUN RISES AND YOUR FAMILY IS STILL PUT TOGETHER, YOU OUGHT TO THANK GOD FOR THAT. EVERY TIME THE SUN RISES AND YOU STILL HAVE HEALTH IN YOUR BODY AND OXYGEN IN YOUR LUNGS, YOU OUGHT TO THANK GOD FOR THAT. THAT'S GOD'S MERCY. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE die daily, but you're still here. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS GOD IS NOT DONE WITH YOU YET. &gt;&gt; AND WHILE YOU'RE STILL HERE, YOU OUGHT TO PRAISE GOD EVERY SINGLE DAY OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; SAY, GOD, THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE. THANK YOU FOR MY FAMILY. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. EVERY MORNING, MERCY WIPES YESTERDAY CLEAN. WE SEE IN PSALMS 23, HE RESTORES my soul. Mercy restores your joy. IT GIVES YOU YOUR PEACE AND YOUR REST AND YOUR STRENGTH. MERCYY'S THERE TO pick you UP WHEN LIFE KNOCKS YOU DOWN. Ain't that right? We see that MERCY REBUILDS WHAT YOU HAVE LOST. MERCY JUST DOESN'T FORGIVE YOU, BUT IT REBUILDS YOU AGAIN. MERCY PUTS BACK WHAT SHAME HAS TOOK. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; WHAT FEAR HAS BROKEN, &gt;&gt; WHAT SIN HAS DAMAGED, WHAT TRAUMA HAS STOLE. MERCY PUTS IT BACK TOGETHER. MERCY JUST DOESN'T LEAVE YOU HALFWAY HEALED, BUT IT completely restores. &gt;&gt; So when David says, HE HE RESTORETH MY SOUL. DAVID HAS BEEN THERE BROKEN, &gt;&gt; BUT HE KNOWS A GOD THAT RESTORED HIM BACK TO WHAT HE WAS AGAIN. HE DIDN'T LEAVE HIM BROKEN IN THE STATE HE was in. AND WE CAN ALL HAVE A TESTIMONY OF THAT THIS MORNING. GOD DIDN'T LEAVE US IN THE BROKEN STATE THAT WE WERE IN. HOW HE FOUND US, HE RESTORED US BACK TO FULL HEALTH AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES YOU RAN FROM GOD, HE WAS THERE TO BRING YOU BACK AGAIN. IF YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD, HE WILL BRING YOU BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's it, preacher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Mercy. &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY GIVES YOU WHAT YOU DIDN'T EARN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; I thank GOD THAT I DON'T HAVE TO EARN IT. &gt;&gt; That I don't have to work for it, but he he gives it unconditionally. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; MERCY OPENS DOORS YOU DIDN'T DESERVE IT. It gives you blessings. &gt;&gt; It gives you strength. &gt;&gt; When people ask, "BROTHER KOBE, HOW HOW DID YOU SURVIVE? HOW HOW DID YOU CHANGE? How how DID YOU GET FREE OF THE ADDICTIONS that you were in? HOW DID YOU RISE ABOVE YOUR PAST? YOUR ANSWER IS MERCY. &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's mercy. &gt;&gt; It's God's mercy. REMEMBER, OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS WAS AS FILTHY RAGS UNTO GOD. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But it was mercy that has clothed you with a new garment today. &gt;&gt; I know this is simple. We can see that mercy has also &gt;&gt; cancelled what the enemy had planned for you as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil planned to turn you into an addict here this morning. HE HE PLANNED TO DESTROY YOUR MIND. HE HE PLANNED TO KEEP YOU BOUND. HE HE PLANNED TO BREAK UP THAT FAMILY, BUT MERCY SAID NO. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Mercy also gives you a a new identity. MERCY SAYS YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT YOUR past anymore. &gt;&gt; You're not your mistakes. YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT your failures. You're you're you're YOU'RE NOT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; BUT IT SAYS YOU are forgiven. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You are loved even when the devil tells you that you're not. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CHOSEN. THANK GOD FOR BEING CHOSEN here this morning. YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCEPTED. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU IN NO MATTER THE MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Mercy has given you a new name here this morning. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Mercy gives you a testimony. You could say, "I shouldn't have been here. &gt;&gt; I shouldn't have MADE IT. I SHOULDN'T BE FREE, but mercy has given you a testimony saying, "I'm here anyway." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. I SHOULDN'T BE FREE, BUT MERCY SAYS YOU'RE FREE. &gt;&gt; That's it, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; If I can say this, mercy fuels your worship here this morning. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's true. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WOR mercy worship differently. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; That's very true. &gt;&gt; Someone that WAS ONCE BOUND HAS NOW BEEN SET FREE CAN WORSHIP A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE ONE THAT IS STILL BOUND BECAUSE THE ONE THAT'S BOUND HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED WHAT GOD CAN DO IN YOUR LIFE. BUT THE ONE THAT WAS bound &gt;&gt; and THE ONE THAT GOD HAS SET FREE CAN LIFT UP THEIR HANDS and sing a LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE CAN SEE WHERE GOD HAS BROUGHT US FROM. &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THE THE THE THE THE deliverances that has taken PLACE IN OUR LIFE. WE OUGHT TO WORSHIP GOD WITH ALL THAT WE HAVE EVERY DAY THAT WE GET UP. WE OUGHT TO PRAISE GOD LIKE WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE BECAUSE HIS MERCY IS EVERLASTING AND IT'S NEW EVERY MORNING. &gt;&gt; That's so true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We can say great is thy faithfulness, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; We see that God links mercy to his faithfulness. And God is faithful when we've been unfaithful. &gt;&gt; Very true. &gt;&gt; God is faithful when we were strong and when we were weak. &gt;&gt; When you're consistent, God has been faithful. When you're struggling, God is still faithful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we see that the sun rises every morning because God is more faithful than that sunrise. We can expect that sunrise to come up every day, can't we? &gt;&gt; It's consistent. &gt;&gt; And we understand that God is more faithful than that sunrise. &gt;&gt; And we see that seasons never fail. It's consistent every year. But neither does God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can someone tell me when God has ever failed anyone? Anyone tell me, has God ever failed you? &gt;&gt; Has God ever let you down? HAS GOD EVER HAS GOD NEVER BEEN THERE FOR YOU IN YOUR TIME of need? &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; THEN WE CAN SAY THAT GOD'S faithfulness is never changing. &gt;&gt; He is consistent time in and time out. &gt;&gt; Ain't that IS THAT OKAY? &gt;&gt; YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCES WHERE FAMILY HAS FAILED AND FRIENDS HAVE FAILED, BUT GOD HAS NEVER FAILED. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, MERCY SHOULD GIVE YOU CONFIDENCE HERE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD GIVE YOU A BOLDNESS TO STAND UP AND SAY, "BECAUSE GOD HAS NEVER FAILED, I CAN FACE TODAY WITH ASURANCES THAT GOD will bring me through one more day. &gt;&gt; I CAN FACE TODAY. I CAN RISE AGAIN. I I CAN WALK IN VICTORY. I I CAN BELIEVE FOR MY FAMILY. I I can believe for my healing." That's what I love ABOUT MY GRANDPA SO MUCH. HE'S BEEN DEALING WITH THIS Parkinson's for many, many years, and he still counts God faithful. &gt;&gt; He knows AND HE'S BELIEVING THAT IF GOD HEALED HIM ONCE BEFORE, HE can do it again. &gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER SEEN GO GRANDPA EVER COMPLAIN ABOUT HIS CONDITION. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW HARD HE'S TRYING TO TALK AND TRYING TO BREATHE, HE STILL COUNTS GOD FAITHFUL. &gt;&gt; HE STILL BELIEVES THAT GOD IS A HEALER. AND THAT'S THE WAY WE SHOULD FEEL EVERY DAY. WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE GETTING OUT OF BED. &gt;&gt; WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE COMING TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. &gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE WE FIGHT THAT EVERY SERVICE. &gt;&gt; WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE PRAISING THE LORD, &gt;&gt; but it's amazing the effort that YOU PUT IN, &gt;&gt; HOW GOD WILL REWARD THAT EFFORT. That's true. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; Very true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay here this morning. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, why don't he? He wants to. He is willing to. He is waiting. Well, you see, I've asked him so many times. I just hate to ask him too much. Ask abundance that your joys might be full. Could you imagine a little fish a half inch long out in the middle of the Pacific saying, "I better drink this water sparingly. I might run out someday." Oh my. Could you think of that little mouse about that big in the great garners of Egypt, thinking, "I'll allow myself one grain a day." Cause I might run out before the next harvest comes in. Oh my. Now divide that by a hundred billion and that's how easy you can exhaust God's mercy and grace to you. If you just believe it, you can just leave yourself. Well, I'm sorry. He says that you can't exhaust him. HE IS THE INEXHAUSTIBLE FOUNTAIN OF ETERNAL LIFE here today to make manifest every divine promise of his Bible to anybody that will believe it. How many believers do we have here tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Yes, sir. The only thing you can do is drink. Come to the fountain," he says, and drink. Drink until you're satisfied because you can't exhaust him. No sir. He is absolutely the inexhaustible and you can just drink and drink and drink. You can drink your healing in. You can drink your salvation and just come and drink. Let him that's thirsty come and drink. He said, "I know he is here and I know he'll do exceedingly more abundantly if we just let him do it." Lamentations 3 and22 says, "It is the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed &gt;&gt; because his compassions fadeth not. They are new every morning." &gt;&gt; As our musicians come here tonight, I pray this was okay. I wanted to keep it short and simple, but I wanted us to understand that his mercies are never failing. So glad for that. So glad God is not like humanity that up and down constantly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God's mercy and his love thinking about my life and what I've been through and what I have today. It's not by what I could do, but it's by God's mercy. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; The beautiful family that I have today. It's God's mercy. &gt;&gt; I think we can all feel that way here this morning. We don't we don't deserve to have what we have. &gt;&gt; True. But it's the mercy of God that has smiled upon you, that has given you something that you didn't deserve. Yet God looked past that and said, "I'll give it to you anyway." Heavenly Father, we humbly come before you, Lord. I know it was very simple and short this morning, but Lord, this is what you placed on my heart early this morning. While I was drinking my coffee, Lord, you begin to let me know that your mercies are new every morning. That your compassions they fail not. Lord, I wanted to come out today and just betray my heart. Lord, let the people know that your mercies are new every morning. Father, I pray that you be with your people here today as they so faithfully have come. Pray Lord that you'll anoint each one. Father, encourage the discouraged here this morning. Lord, the sick and afflicted, heal them. Father, every chain here this morning, Lord, may it be broken. We love you, Lord. In your name we pray. Amen. And amen. What are you playing? Huh? Mercy said no. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. Mercy said no. Sin will never take control. Life and death stood face to face. Darkness tried to steal my heart away. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Mercy. Can we go up a key? Mercy said, "Oh, I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. Mercy said no. Sin will never take control. Oh, life and death stood face to face. Darkness tried to steal my heart away. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Mercy said no. Sing that again now. Oh, mercy said no. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. Thank you, Lord. Oh, mercy said, "Oh, sin will never take control." Oh, life and death to face to face. Darkness try steal my heart away. Thank you Jesus. Mercy said no. Oh morning I see you in the sunrise every morning. It's like a picture that you paint it for me. Love letter in the sky. Story. Oh, story. I could have had a really different story. you from heaven to restore me forever. Change my life. Nobody loves me like you. Love me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Amazing way. I worship you as long as I am breathing. God, you are faithful and true. Nobody loves me like you. Mountains, oh mountains, singing now as brother Merl comes. the weight of every mountain. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Surrounded. You never leave my side. Everybody now, nobody loves me. Oh, oh, nobody loves me like Sing ways I worship you as long as I am breathing. God, you are faithful and true. Nobody loves me like you. Sing it again. Nobody loves me like you. Love me, Jesus. I stand in awe of your amazing ways. I worship you as long as I am redeemed. God, you are faithful and true. Nobody loves me like you. Can the redeemed say so this morning? Do you have a testimony of his mercy? Every son and daughter of God has a testimony, &gt;&gt; of his grace and mercy. Amen. I know it wasn't very long this morning, but it was powerful. It's not in the quantity, it's in the quality of the message &gt;&gt; of the hour. I know brother Brandham preached a lot of long sermons, but there was a reason for that, too. He had a lot to say. He had a lot to restore. Amen. But I'm I'm thankful for Brother Kobe and his message this morning. &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a song Gordon Mo talked about the preacher that it was long- winded, but one morning, Sunday morning, he got up and said, "Love, love, love." And he sat back down. Amen. That's what he was led to tell the people. Amen. What something they I'm sure they lacked. Amen. Oh, how Jesus said, "I would that you would love one another." Amen. That all men may know you're my disciples. Amen. So appreciate that, Brother Kobe. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I don't think God's going to at the at the great white throne judgment and and every person that's a sinner goes, "You did this, you did that, you sinned here, and you sinned there, and that's why I'm sending you in hell." I I don't think it's the way it's going to be because we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God. I think he's what he's going to say is why didn't you accept my mercy? &gt;&gt; Why didn't you accept my grace? &gt;&gt; But you turned it down. I'm so glad I received his mercy and his grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just in in flesh. They brought a woman to him that is was caught in the very act. Now, I don't know why they didn't bring the man because the law said you bring both of them and they both get stoned. Why did they just bring the woman? So, we've caught her in the very act. The law says stone her, right? Jesus just kneel down. wrote in the sand or the ground. No one knows what he wrote. I guess I don't know if Brother Brandham ever mentioned it. But he said, "He that's without sin cast the first stone." &gt;&gt; Go ahead, you you you priests and you righteous Pharisees. I'm thinking that he he might have wrote the names of the the women that they had been with. Wonder that if that's what he wrote. They could see wrote Elizabeth or whoever. No wonder they dropped their stones and walked away. He revealed their sin because they weren't righteous either. None of us are righteous. And what did he do when he turned to the woman? Woman, where are your accusers? &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't have any." &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." That's what he told me. "Neither do I condemn you. go and sin no more because you've accepted my mercy and grace. Can you give him a praise THIS MORNING? OH, IT OUGHT to mean more to you than than life. Amen. God's mercy. Amen. I pray we don't forget it, brother Harry. Amen. His mercy and his grace. And if he's been merciful to you and gracious to the you, you can you can be to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's those that are bitter and hard and cold. That's the ones God doesn't like. Forgive one another. Amen. It's hard. It's hard for one human to forgive another human. I know because I've had things done to me and I've done things to other people. Amen. But I'm thankful for his mercy. Can you give him one more praise? Thank you, Lord, for your mercy. Amen. So, I I had this song in my heart and I just opened up my song book. Amen. Like I open up my Bible sometimes when brother Randle turn says turn to uh book chapter verse and I my wife knows this. I open up my Bible and it's right there. That's his mercy. Amen. Like how did I turn to the exact scripture and it's happened like what 10 times? I think, oh, thank you, Lord. Amen. That'd be so mindful of me. But I opened up my song book and I had this whole chorus on my heart and it I just opened right to it. Like, thy loving kindness is better than life. Let's try it this morning. Maybe uh D or F. Thy loving kindness is better than life. Oh, I might dance this morning. Living kindness is better than life. Oh, my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee. I will lift. How about it, Sister Thelma? Is his loving kindness better than life? Thy loving kindness is better than life. Thy loving kindness is How about it, Sister Devil? Oh, my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee. I will lift up my hands in thy name. Oh, let's praise him. Oh, thy loving kind. We need to do that next. Is better than life. Thy loving kindness is better than life. My lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee. I will lift up my hands in thy name. I'll lift up my hands. Oh, I lift my hands, Lord, unto thy name.

Well, God bless each and every one of you. Amen. I pray that you were blessed this morning. Amen. I know he'll give us above all we can even ask or think. Amen. And that uh that scripture you read about uh uh using that word extoll. Amen. I'm kind of into words. How about you, brother Harry? Just a little bit. And uh I thought, what does that mean? X toll. E X T O L. And so I thought I knew what it meant, but I wasn't sure. And it means to praise. Anybody knows what it means? To praise enthusiastically. I thought that was wonderful. Amen. And on down there, he talked about thy loving kindness and everything. It's just not to just, oh, you know, lift up my hands. It's to praise enthusiastically. Amen. I believe that's what David did. Amen. Before the Lord when the ark was returned. And uh my what a type that the that the ark has been returned that contains the word. Amen. To the bride. Amen. Are you thankful this morning? Amen. So, do we have uh we have food at the fellowship hall? All right. Well, it's nice and warm over there. Amen. So, and hot water. Amen. So, the Lord has blessed us and we just want to thank him for for his for his all that he's done. And so, uh come and eat with us and fellowship. And we got uh another service tonight at 5. And uh I believe our brother Harry's going to uh preach the words of life to us this evening. So let's remember brother Harry this afternoon. And uh Amen. lift him up before the Lord in prayer. And amen. I believe we'll say it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. So if we just maybe uh bow our heads uh for a uh for a dismissal prayer. Amen. And just heavenly father, how we thank you for this day that you've made Lord. How you open up the words of life to us and Amen gave us drink Lord. Amen to quench our thirst, Lord. And and we just thank you for all your blessings. We thank you for our church, Lord, providing all of our needs, Lord. We pray that you'll go with us. Amen. That you'll bless the food that's that's being prepared, Lord. and bless our fellowship and give us rest in our bodies as you as you already have in our souls that you bring us back together at the appointed time. Amen. For we ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless yours being dismissed. There's never been a day amen and f there's never been a day like this day to me. And there's never been a day like this day. I see. Oh, there's never been a light that shines so bright as this day. This glory day. We have a verse for Christ is revealing himself to me. He has opened my eyes and now I can see his word is becoming a reality on this day. This glory.
