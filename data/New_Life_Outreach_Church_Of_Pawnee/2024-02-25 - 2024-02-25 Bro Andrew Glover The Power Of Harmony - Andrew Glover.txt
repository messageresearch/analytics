hallelujah amen hallelujah how many can say thank the Lord amen amen a lot of things got between us and him but he never left amen he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he said but I'll be with you always even to the end of the world and prophet of God come along and said that's the end of the consummation of the ages and he said but right here in the end time he's still in our midst amen and I believe he's here tonight don't you amen I believe he's here to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ask or think amen we want to say God bless you all this evening my wonderful song service wasn't it amen to hear the songs designed to Be Sung and the atmosphere created it's okay go ahead and give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen amen it's a it's a real privilege and honor to to be able to sing the songs of Zion and amen the Lord has blessed you with some wonderful musicians here and amen I tell you just sitting back there in the back room listening to him Play Amen the Lord sure has bless the assembly and amen the devil hates people that play gospel music and the services and give their gifts and talents to God because it drives him out of the building amen makes way for the Holy Spirit to come in and do something special for his children and amen tonight if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we'll go straight to the word we'll invite you to the book of St John the 15th chapter and also we're going to look look in the book of Acts the 2 chapter but we'll begin here in John 15 amen we do want to say God bless you all this evening and my we pray something was said this morning to be a blessing to you to be a help and an encouragement amen we that's our only desire is to be a blessing and a help to God's people and amen we sure appreciate the church here appreciate your labor of love and your stand for this word and amen we sure love and appreciate brother Wendell and his family and dear friends of ours we sure love you buddy and appreciate your stand for this message and amen I tell you um it's a it is a a special time to be serving the lord amen the Lord is doing some some wonderful things for his children and amen I'm glad to be a be a part of what God is doing in this generation amen and we want to say we're sure under expectation in a few days of uh the camp meeting coming up and just believing the Lord to meet with us there once again and I tell you I know it's a lot of work and a burden and a a lot of a burden for Souls but it's a lot of work comes with it but we want to say say thank you all and God bless the assembly here for all that you do Amen to do that for the young people I know they they sure appreciate it and amen we appreciate youall for allowing us to come and be a part of it amen we sure thank the Lord for what he's doing there as well and amen tonight we want to look here in the book of St John the 15th chapter and I want to read out of the fifth verse of St John 15:5 it's a very familiar reading Jesus here speaking he says I am the vine and ye are the branches now he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing amen without me you can do nothing but then you skip down the 15th verse and he says now henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you you amen now ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it unto you now in the book of Acts the 2 chapter acts the 2 chapter we want to look in the first verse it's another a very familiar reading to us it's the scripture speaking to us about what happened there on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 and verse number one you love the Lord this evening the Bible says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord somebody say one Accord one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the the house where they were sitting amen let's just bow our hearts together tonight Heavenly Father Lord as we have read your word we believe that you are in your word now father we're asking you to come into this meeting tonight in a special way by your mercy and Grace Lord you see the needs of your children here tonight there's no way that I as a man Lord could minister to every need but Lord I know that if I can get myself out of the way and surrender to you Lord then you can take that that gift that you play in my life and Lord you can control it and you can operate it Lord I pray God that you would send the spirit of Liberty into the building tonight father may you not just anoint me to speak your word but may you anoint the children of God to pull and Lord to receive from your word and Lord may we not leave here the same as we came father but Lord may we leave here change may we leave here Lord with a deeper understanding with a greater love and a greater determination than ever to serve you and to walk in your ways Lord we ask your mercy and Grace Upon Our Lives now father we commit this meeting in your hands have your way Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you tonight as you can have your seats here amen I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight to speak to you on this thought here amen I want to speak to you on the power of Harmony amen the power of Harmony brother Bram speaking here and I'm drawing my thought from a couple quotes brother Bram heing question ansers 54 he says now the main thing above everything is to keep the church in Harmony and in love of God and moving on if we can all believe that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and unrighteousness he said then if the woman sitting next to you or the man sitting next to you if he doesn't believe that Jesus will actually come visibly again he said well let's just believe it and go right ahead anyhow he said we don't agree with him on the scripture amen but let's make the church move on for Harmon Harmony because in there he says we're going to catch some more people but when the church is out of Harmony he said then you hurt the church you hurt the cost amen so Harmony has the ability Amen to bring more people in it has the ability to actually catch people or to reach people amen when the church is in harmony again he said spiritual experiences I believe that everything Amen in the natural line Works in harmony or should with the spiritual in the side man brother said let your faith just meet that condition and it will be for thou has said as thou has believed in thy heart amen so shall it be he said and I pray that you'll grant that tonight and make the whole atmosphere here Lord make it a creative atmosphere of one soul of one mind of one Accord and one purpose amen Lord make the whole atmosphere here A Creative atmosphere amen of one soul and one mind of one Accord and one purpose again the uncertain s he said now this person amen what if you could ever get this Soul on the inside amen soul in harmony with God Amen that your soul and God would be one together think about that that if you could ever get your soul on the inside amen soul in harmony with God Amen that your soul and God would be one together then you could ask what you will and it shall be given unto you now amen I believe that God Amen desires Harmony in the church I believe that I believe that amen above anything God wants to see amen the Spirit of Harmony working in the church now you all know amen that Lucifer hates Harmony as a matter of fact he is the enemy of Harmony and he will do anything he can Amen to see that the harmony is broken amen because Lucifer will use Discord Amen to break up the harmony now the Bible tells us in Proverbs 16 or 6:19 that a that the Lord hates seven things amen and one of those things is is he amen that Seth Discord among the Brethren now that word Discord is Strife or contention and the prophet said one thing God hates is sowing Discord amen among the Brethren he said in them the organizations is what does it see amen it shows Discord among the brethren we should be standing in the breach and saying amen we are brothers another place he says I believe in the fatherhood of God Amen and the Brotherhood of Man how many can say I believe in the fatherhood of God Amen and the Brotherhood of Man he said I think that we're brothers together and that's way we should be and God has his children now maybe some of them are a little odd to our belief or your belief or mine amen but God is accepting his children amen so we have to accept them as our brothers and our sisters amen that's right now think about that amen there's people that you don't accept and there's people that I wouldn't accept because of certain ways or person alties or amen human nature but but the thing about it is amen if it wasn't for the grace of God Amen then none of us would have been accepted amen but God who looks beyond all of our faults and all of our failures and all of our peculiarity amen Our God has already accepted us amen as his sons and daughters so if God Amen has accepted the person sitting next to you amen as his son or his daughter amen I think you all accept him as your brother amen accept him as your sister come on church amen because there's one thing the devil don't want is he don't want the Harmony and the unity of God Amen coming into the church now many people they think well you know we're so deep and we're so revelated and we got so much Revelation that it's almost it's almost childish you know to preach on Harmony or Unity but I believe amen that no matter how deep we've gotten in Revelation we're not Beyond amen keeping the spirit of unity Amen in Harmony in the Church of the Living God now the Propet of God says it like this amen he said in the fourth dimension I I want you to hear this quote because I believe amen that Harmony is more important than we realize I believe amen that we must be in harmony or in tune with God Amen in order to declare the supernatural do you realize that we are here Amen to declare the supernatural how many agree we are here to declare the supernatural now do you realize if Harmony and unity is broken amen the supernatural will not be declared amen then the church will become a natural church amen but we're there there's aund natural churches around friends amen but we're here Amen to be a supernatural church amen a lighthouse amen a living witness amen that the god of history is no longer historical God Amen but he is a living God and he's moving in his church and he's delivering people he's saving Souls he's healing bodies he's not a dead historical God he's a living God and he still works the supernatural now the prophet of God said in the fourth dimension he said people can prove right through this room now amen is coming radio activity radio messages amen coming right through this building now is coming television pictures amen but it's too fast for our eyes he said now you go a millions of miles beyond that Dimension and you'll get into a place that's just as real as television pictures is in this room this morning he said now theirs the Lord Jesus Christ he says the resurrected Son of God standing here and that's the reason you can't see him is because your heart hasn't become tuned down to it think about that God is in this building right here tonight he said but you can't see him because our heart hasn't become tuned down to it he said that's the reason that we cannot see television pictures amen is our bodies are not set as instruments Amen to pick up mechanical sent things but when our body becomes in tune with God becoming a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power and amance he has risen from the dead he lives Among Us he wants Fellowship back with his people again his majesty his glory is now spreading forth amen he's Desiring to Fellowship again amen with his people like he did in the garden of leading amen now let me say this the fall in the garden amen man got out of tune with God right amen the fall in the garden man got out of tune with God Amen and Harmony was broken now do you realize when Harmony is broken there are repercussions the prophet of God tells us that amen there when he was sent among the Pentecostals he said my my mother-in-law said you're not taking my daughter amen down there among that trash and he said well he said she's my wife and and she said well she's my daughter he said now listen I listen to the woman amen instead of listening to God and he said then sorrow set in immediately he said the 1937 foot came Sorrows begin to break in things went wrong at the church he said the congregation begin to drop amen just get out of Harmony One Time amen with God he said in friends I'll always regret it amen as long as I live amen now let me say this that was the same spirit amen that mored in the Garden of Eden Amen to cause Harmony to be broken there amen was still trying to break up Harmony amen because when man is Out Of Tune with God and he's out of harmony with God he cannot declare the supernatural he cannot confess the promises of God Amen but God by the new birth amen and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen has made a way amen that Harmony could be restored he said the new birth is an experience see it's a gift of God it's the Seal of your faith amen and we believe him then if you say you believe and do not receive the Holy Spirit then you do not believe because God promised to give you amen the Holy Spirit when you did believe amen now watch when the spirit of God Amen comes into a man it quickens him and then he becomes a new creature he believes in the immortal God he believes that he does all things amen and his heart is in tune with God when a man gets born again amen and receives the Seal of God Amen that automatically put his heart Amen in tune with God and he becomes a new creature and he can declare things that the man that has not been born again cannot declare amen all that a unborn man can declare amen is the five senses of the Inner Man and the outer man amen but God by the new birth amen has regenerated you and has called you to declare things amen not by SE not by smell not by feel or imagination but you've been called to declare things amen by the six sense which is the super sense and it'll call everything else contrary Amen to the word of God let me say this no matter what happens in your life no matter what trials you go through no matter what disappointment you face don't you ever let your heart get out of tune with god brother God said no matter what you got here in this world what you haven't got you keep your heart right in tune with God Amen everything all your houses lands all your money all your sickness all your Health all your children everything you've got here on this Earth everything will leave you and it'll go right straight back to the beginning again but if that heart is right with God you'll come forth again as certain as there is a God in heaven but if it's not right with God you've got to take the other route amen I find it amazing amen the promt of God has ask a question one time in question answers they said brother brandom why would Christ amen appear to me as I was about to take the sacraments now they're having communion and here the prophet of God says amen that somebody asked him why that Christ would appear he said well no doubt amen that your heart was just in tune amen and as you were coming sacredly up to God that's why he appeared to you amen if your heart is in tune with God it has the ability Amen to bring the Unseen into the scene amen and Christ can appear to you and he can change you he can bless you amen because why your heart is in harmony with God now when you look at this word harmony what it means is the combination amen of simultaneously sounded musical notes Amen to produce chords amen and chord progressions having a pleasing effect amen the quality of forming a pleasing and consistent hold amen Harmony is very important in musical Productions amen because the purpose of music is to display the ability of Harmony amen and in other words Harmony has the ability to bring everybody on the same page amen singing the same song playing the same chord amen and it's not having an unpleasing effect but it's having a pleasing effect and as Harmony is coming in the church amen the church is progressing amen by the harmony it's being given to the church now the Bible says in John 5 amen that Jesus cured an impotent man amen at the pool of beesa y'all remember that amen and the Bible says that he did that on the Sabbath day and when he did that the Jews amen rose up to persecute Jesus and they sought to slay him because he had done these things on the Sabbath day and Jesus said my father worketh hitherto and I work now therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father amen making himself equal with God the Bible says in St John 5:19 verily verily I say unto you amen the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for what things soever he doeth amen these also doeth the son likewise said now knowest all things he said when he passed by the pool and he seen all the people and he healed a man amen the Jews question him why he said I do nothing amen but what the father shows me I can't do nothing but whatever he does he shows me and then I go do it he said now we notice here he was a kind man was a humble man amen but yet he was a man of power how many believes that Jesus was a kind man you believe he was a humble man do you believe he was a man of power amen when he spoke he was very humble and gentle but when it come time Amen to separate the truth from the error amen then Jesus was very Stern he picked up some ropes and tied them together kicked over the money Chargers table and beat them out of the temple and called the Pharisees those religious people a bunch of Hypocrites and serpents and Snakes in the Grass amen see he was a man amen who could speak when it come time to speak he was a man who was full of love amen but I want you to catch this church he loved his father so much amen till he stayed in harmony with his father and anything that interfered with the harmony amen that's where Jesus draw the line amen he was a man of love he was a man of power he was a gentle man he was a humble man but anything that Rose up Amen to break the harmony between him and his father amen Jesus drew the line and said that's as far as you're going to go listen amen as long as they were saying what they wanted to doing what they wanted to he just went right on Amen but when they brought their nonsense in the house of God Amen and turned the House of Prayer into the house of money and thieves he said that's as far as you're going to go and he drew the line and he kept the harmony amen between him and his father listen friends I believe believe that we received a prophet in this generation amen with the same Ministry of Jesus Christ and watch a Vindicated Prophet the only thing I'm here for is to follow the instructions of my brothers amen as long as it doesn't interfere amen with the things that God has for me to do listen I think that ought to be where you draw the line too is anything that breaks the harmony between you and your father ought to be the place you draw the line and say the spirit will not have any more leeway we will not give him any more room we will not give him any more air amen we're going to stop this thing somewhere because we're not getting out of harmony with our father now when you look at this word interfere it means to take part or to intervene in an activity without invitation or necessity it is to prevent a process or activity from continuing or being carried out properly it is of a Fame to strike against something when working it is to get in the way of now I love this definition brother wendle to interfere with something means to handle or adjust something without permission Amen to interfere with something is to handle something or to adjust something without permission now watch a prophet amen Satan is the master at interfering he said we find Satan right quickly at work with God's program we see that malignant eye of the devil amen that serpent that has always tried to interfere here amen with God's program before it comes on the earth now you want me to show that to you in the Bible amen the Bible says that cor and D amen rose up to interfere with Moses delivering Israel amen from the land of Egypt let me say that same devil that interfere with Moses amen returned in this day and tried to interfere with our Moses while he was preaching 1953 earnestly contending for the faith brother just preaching there along and he's talking about the pillar of fire and Divine Healing and all the promises of God and he comes down here and if you look there on your table sometime your folio views amen you'll see this in Brackets it says brother brandham stops amen as a model airplane noise interferes so here's a prophet preaching and while he's preach and he stops amen and the and the and they put it in there that what was interfering amen was a model airplane noise he said now see how the devil will do now if you want to see the devil look out here he got in them men out there and seen them do such things as that now if someone said do you mean that was the devil he said what other thing would interfere with God's spirit but the devil amen here is a prophet amen who is preaching a message Amen to call a bride from a lay out of SE an airplane age into a bride age with an astronaut anointing and the devil gets on some preachers they were preachers Amen to fire up a model airplane and the prop of God said certainly a bunch of preachers turned them out there to do that amen trying to stop the meeting but you can't stop God Amen God will move on exactly the same there is nothing simply nothing can stop God Amen or the power of God them same people if they don't repent he said they will lay in Hell forever in fact you're judging know I'm not by their fruits amen you shall know them amen are you hearing me amen Jesus will not be defeated his message will not be defeated his word will not be defeated the supernatural will not be defeated amen I don't care what devil to defeat God Amen there is an anointing with the spirit of God the prophet of God said and remember are you hearing me he said now remember the devil is always a skeptic of the sons of God Amen but Christians always overcome amen Christians always overcome because God wants to display his power he said now look all the Babylon and Hell could not defeat that purpose no matter if I could he that furnace a million times hotter it would have never destroyed the purpose of God because God wanted to show that he was the god of Deliverance and he would bring a Deliverance to whomever he desired to bring it amen and nothing would interfere with his program let me say this to you friends the same Harmony that was between the father and the son has now come into existence between the bride and the groom and the prophet said the harmony now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life and she receives it she never it amen therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted amen the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this amen the word is in the bride amen the word is in the bride as it was in Mary amen and the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with his word she performs the command of his word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and comes to pass amen like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full Harvest amen serving its purpose amen let me say this every devil in hell is trying to interfere between you and your father because he knows that you're not on the Earth by accident you are on the earth for a purpose and the devil's trying to defeat you in that purpose amen but I want to say nothing amen will defeat the purpose of God Amen sickness will not defeat it Church trouble will not defeat it criticism will not defeat it Skeptics will not defeat it amen God will bring his purpose into fruition and there ain't enough devils in hell to defeat God Amen in doing what God wants to do in the age he wants to do it in now I say this I believe we're on the earth for more amen than just to serve a just to serve a career or to serve an education but I believe God has brought us on the earth amen and we are here Amen to be fruit bearers and lightbearers the Bible said we are God's fruit bearers the prophet of God brings that from John 15 and said ye are the branches he said now the vine puts forth the fruit but the branches has to Bear the fruit if the branch is getting its life out of the vine well it's the same kind of life that's in the vine don't you think so it has to be now he says our hands and our lips and our eyes he said them God's hands lips and eyes that we have here he has has on earth now he's gone back to God Amen to send forth his energy of his spirit amen to anoint us with a holy spirit then if we are submissive to him amen that our hands represent his hands amen that's the reason he said amen they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the church is the fruit bearers today he said my hand is his hand your hand is his hand your eyes and my eyes is his eyes he just uses us us amen as yielded branches we are the fruit bearers on the earth amen bearing the fruit of the brine right in John or rather in Matthew 5:14 the Bible said ye are the light of the world you are a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hid it says neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel or on a Candlestick and give a light unto all that's in the house so let your light shine before men amen that they may see your good works amen and glorify your father which is in heaven listen to The Prophet's prayer he said we thank thee to be lightbearers of this age to be ready Amen to manifest the promised word for the age that we're now living in amen knowing that in the beginning you allotted your word knowing the end from the beginning each age you allotted your word to that age and somehow we don't know how it ever happened but in each one of those ages as we look back upon the word amen we see that there was an anointing come in in that age amen that fulfilled the word amen and in the last days we're now living in there is a lotted word a promise for this age he said we believe that the holy spirit amen is here on the earth now amen trying to find Hearts Amen to manifest and to bring to pass by vindicating the word that is now been prophesied for this day in this hour listen if we have the word without the anointing the purpose will never be fulfilled it takes the anointing amen is it okay to preach it takes the anointing Amen to come upon the word amen to fulfill the word in the season that God has allotted that word to be fulfilled in that I say tonight I still believe in the anointing I believe in the anointing of Isaiah 10 that said the Yoke shall be destroyed amen because of the anointing I'm going to ask you a question if you got tired amen of living under that yoke amen are you tired of living under that yoke of depression that yoke of criticism that yoke of this and that amen are you ready to let the anointing amen come in the building and destroy that thing come on church I think we ought to I don't think we ought to get free on Sunday and be bound get on Wednesday I don't think we ought to get free on Wednesday and be bound get on Sunday I believe if the anointing ever breaks out in the church it will not break the Yoke it will destroy the Yoke and the Bible said the Yoke shall be destroyed amen because of the anointing amen I believe it I believe the True Believers is here on the earth amen and I believe you're here Amen to fulfill the word I believe that I believe you are here on the earth Amen to fulfill the word of God I believe with all my heart amen I believe that you are a part amen of God and the prophet of God said now when God comes in the inner part of a man in the inner part of a man he said a man is made up in the system of a Tabernacle in the outer courts then the holy place and the holies of holies see the Shak of Glory on the inside of the veil do you all realize the Bible says that there is an old man and there is a new man amen and the old man amen has got to die so that the new man can come into manifestation in Romans 6:6 the Bible said knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin amen might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin in Ephesians 2:14 for he is our peace who ha made both one and has broken down the middle wall of petition between us having abolished in the flesh amen the enmity even the law of Commandments amen contained in ordinances amen for to make in himself of Twain one new man amen so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby in Ephesians 3:16 that we would Grant unto you according to the riches of his glory amen to be strengthened amen with the might by his his spirit in the Inner Man in Ephesians 2 or 4:22 that you put off concerning the former conversation amen the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitfulness of lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that you may put on the new man which is after God Amen created in righteousness and true Holiness in 2 Corinthians 4:16 for which cause we think not amen but though our outward man perish amen yet the inward man is renewed amen day by day amen your outward man is getting weaker your outward man is getting older your outward man is getting more wrinkles and more gray hair amen and more sicknesses amen but there is a man on the inside amen that's getting stronger and he's getting stronger come on church this message has come in this generation Amen to weaken your flesh amen and to strengthen your soul your flesh is the enemy of God your flesh is what don't want you to praise your flesh is what don't want you to say Amen man it's your flesh that don't want you Amen to pull on the word of God it's your flesh that says I'm too tired to go to church I'm too tired to pray I'm too tired to fast amen that is your flesh amen but there's an inward man on the inside of you listen and if you left the inward man raise up he will crucify the outward man and there will be a resurrection amen a strength and power and human ability will vanish and the Divine ability of God will come into operation in your soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen I believe it I believe this message amen has come to weaken your flesh want me prove it to you amen have you ever sit down and read Luke the first chapter amen where the Bible talks about Mary amen the angel come to Mary and the prophet of God said she received a hard message brother John he said that was a message that nobody ever heard amen that a virgin's going to bring forth the son now if you go read Luke 1 you will see that the angel appears to Mary amen and begins to to talk to Mary and as the angel begins to talk amen the human flesh of Mary begins to say some words like this amen how can this be amen who's going to bring this to pass a are you hearing me amen what is going on here amen but every question she asked the angel had an answer and he just kept on delivering the message he kept on delivering the message he kept on delivering the message until when the angel got done delivering the message amen the message of the angel had so defeated the Flesh of Mary amen that all she could say was be it unto me Lord according to Thy word I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know when it's going to happen amen but if this Angel's message is true that he will come on church and we have received the message of the Angel of the Lord and he said there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a body change how's it going to happen I don't know but when the angel got done preaching to me all I could say was be it unto me Lord according to Thy word are you hearing me when you get done hearing a tape it ought to rob you of human ability and release the Divine ability every's tape you listen to it ought to make your flesh so weak that your flesh can't argue with a word it can't argue with a promise but all your soul can say is be it unto me according in to Thy word the outward man is perishing but the inward man is renewed look at Colossians 3:9 lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him now I believe this anointing is not striking just the outside man I believe it's striking the Inside Man the prod of God says it like this did you know that there's another man on the inside of your body and that's a spirit man see that's right that's now how this is here the inside man he said now this Inside Man if it is of god it's the spirit of God that's inside our being now my finger could not move without something to make it move it works from an intelligent amen here that the Mind subconsciously just maybe if it happened to think to reach over here I don't have to think about it now there's where Faith lays so here the the prophet breaks it down and said there's a conscience and there's a subconscious he said if we start overseas by ship he said there's a man sitting a here he's the one who gives the orders he said the man goes down in the ship to run the ship down here well he don't see where he's going but he just takes orders from up above well now he says steer to the left or to the right give this engine more and that or whatever it is he just works by orders but way down in the midst of us here in our heart is the subconscious and it takes orders from up here well now you've heard me on the platform many times no doubt I was just hearing a tape from the Owensburg meeting the other day he said about a person who was crippled was healed how it was speaking how the Holy Spirit was speaking now up here this conscience comes up to that platform brother Brandon praise the Lord I have faith but right down there in that other little conscience said now you know you haven't see well now if you act if you can get this one and that one in harmony with that one amen this one saying yes all the time this one saying yes amen but way down and there something's little fell just out see you want to make it you want to say yes but it's just down there that little shadow that makes you and don't deal with this little fell down here very much well you'll find out he just kindly does the ruling you see after all he's the one who drives the ship see he's the one who does the steering this one might say a lot this guy that does the work down here see so this one right here say oh yes I believe that oh I sure do well if that's right this and disagree with that then we've got it see then it'll have to work but but until that does it well it just won't work that's all because you got orders going this way and this one going this way and there's just pulling your ship one way and you don't get out of the harbor amen so get these fellas to agreeing and saying God Is Right amen this says God is right this says God Is Right amen then we move forward are you hearing what a prophet saying he's saying get your conscience in harmony with your subconscious and your subconscious in harmony with the word and get all three of them saying the same thing that God Is Right his word is right he said we got orders everything there's nothing in your way there's nothing to make it out it all the symtoms you could have you might go back to the hospital in the morning and they'd say well your arm is still stiff and the cancer is still there amen but that wouldn't phes you a bit amen see because if that this and this is agreed amen then Faith does anything let me say this harmony has a supernatural power amen if you can get the subconscious amen and the man upstairs amen the subconscious and the conscience all in agreement amen the ship is going to leave the harbor and if you can get a believer's conscience in agreement with the subconscious and get all those in agreement with the word amen then there will become a display of the supernatural power of almighty God and he will deliver you from the situation he will heal you from the sickness he will bring you out of the bondage of the enemy listen I believe Harmony has a supernatural power brother said now in you is God who have the Holy Ghost amen God is in you do you believe that amen Jesus said I give you power he said now let me show you amen the weakness of the church by God's grace I give you power over unclean spirits you'll cast them out not I will you will you'll cast in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues now do we believe that they shall take up serpents and they shall drink deadly things and it will not harm them now look in Acts 28 the pr God reads it about Paul said he was gathering a bundle of sticks and he laid them on the fire amen and there come up a viper out of the Heat and fastened on his hand now do you realize what happens here amen is God has promised Paul amen by a heavenly vision that Paul is going to a certain destination and the prophet of God said when he throwed some wood down amen a great deadly Beast a serpent amen bit him right to the hand he said now that Beast was so deadly till if it bit a person they usually Dro dead within a minute or two now the natives said look at this man the chains on him he's a prisoner he must be a murderer see he might escape the storm but he's just not going to escape this serpent he's going to die he said but now look a moment amen Paul looked and seen it now look Paul is gathering sticks amen and there's a serpent bites him on the hand amen and the serpent brother William has fastened his things Amen to the to the prophet's hand and the part of God said Paul looked and seen it amen but this this and that all agreed amen and there was not a speck of fear in other words Paul's conscience was in agreement with the subconscious and the subconscious and the conscience was in agreement with the heavenly vision that you will stand before king of grippa and nothing will defeat you Amen in standing before the Prophet come on church I believe that ought to be the same Harmony that ought to be in every believer here tonight that no matter what serpent bites me no matter what devil attacks me no matter what Spirit tries to stop me amen I have had a vision spoken over my life I'm going in the Rapture I'm going in the future home I'm going to take a body change I'm going to wear a crown I'm going to lay down my sword I'm going to lay down my shield now ien amen if you don't want me to preach quit pushing amen I tell you why that things don't move you no more is you gotten so theological amen that you can't receive Revelation and you become a cold formal theologian and the power of the Holy Ghost don't move you the anointing don't move you because you got everything figured out for your intellectual ability amen but I curse that devil in the name of Jesus Christ and I invite the spirit of Revelation to come back in the church until there's a liberty of anointing I don't care about your intellectualism I don't care about your message education I care about the power of the harmony of the Holy Ghost amen coming in the church in the fire and the Dynamics of the spirit of God I'd rather be S dumb I couldn't quote one scripture and read one good quote and have the harmony of the Holy Ghost amen burning in my body well I might as well preach I'm here and we got so theological we can't even enjoy the anointing no more that's so that's so educated and so intellectual amen we can't even enjoy a good old a good old Sunday night meeting I remember Sunday nights brother him I remember when he used to sing to the glory came down I remember when he used to preach till the fire fell I remember we used to shout and dance and enjoy the promises of God Amen I tell you what put that out is a bunch of cold formal ideas amen put the move of the Holy Ghost on the outside and said well we need teaching and we need some good sound saying teaching well let me say this William Brandon was the greatest teacher that ever stood on the face of the Earth and taught the scripture and there was still a fire of stimulation by Revelation that come into His me meetings and back the thing up and I pray to God we never get so educated that we can't let the stimulation of the revelation of the Holy Ghost come in the church and back up our young people's praise and back up our worship and back up our praise come on I think it's time to break out of the shackles and the chains of intellectualism and let the Holy Ghost back in the church what somebody prais him I said somebody praise him that's how we're going to run that devil out of here is we're going to praise and we're going to sing and we're going to shout and we're going to preach and we're going to enjoy the stimulation of the Revelation that'll deliver a man from things it'll save a home I hate that code formal intellectual level it comes in the house of God and tries to clamp down the atmosphere and clamp down the song service and clamp down y'all got the wrong guy to push against tonight and clamp down the anointing I think we ought to push back I think we ought to push back against that devil until we should get some Liberty in the church and can have church again whatever happened to just having Church whatever happened to just singing brother Merl if the Holy Ghost come in the building and he wanted to run he just ran if the Holy Ghost come in the building and somebody wanted to shout they just shouted amen but some ey sickles gathered and tried to shut the fire down but I invite the pillar of fire to burn the icicles out and bring the anointing of the Holy Ghost in power and demonstration back into the church again well go ahead and praise God go ahead and praise him praise him for his word praise him for his Deliverance praise him for his anointing praise him for his victory that's it buddy amen amen you got a young man over there praising God Amen listen church I think it's time Amen to get in agreement with the word and get out of agreement with everything else come on get back in agreement with the Holy Ghost Paul wasn't scared he knew knew who he was Paul didn't stand there and quote a bunch of quotes he knew in his subconscious and his conscience and the vision that nothing was going to destroy him so you know what he done he just stood there for a minute and it just shook it off now come on Church there was some people standing there sister Angie they were waiting on Paul to die they were waiting on him to kill over y'all know what there's some people doing they're literally waiting on you to call to just kill over they want you to just fall over they want you to choke on your words and they don't want the anointing to break out in the meeting amen but let me say this if it couldn't defeat Paul it will not defeat this bride because what our Prophet preached is the same thing Paul preached if he walked in the word we're walking in the word and we refuse to be diluted down to some lukor Toral amen social gathering on a Sunday night this is the house of change this is the house of Liberty this is where the Holy Ghost comes and does things that men cannot do and fixes situations that we cannot counsel come on Church you want some counsel amen bring the counselor back in the building he's the Mighty God of Isaiah he's the Prince of Peace he's the Everlasting father if you'll turn him loose he'll fix all your situations well is it the truth or what I think it's time to get out of agreement with all the problems and get back in agreement with a word and let the harmony of the Holy Ghost come back in the church amen because what happens the part of God said miracles are done he said they were so perfectly in harmony with God that first church and Christian friend until we can get back to that amen denomination will not bring it amen but perfect love and confidence in God is what brings it so the conscience the subc conscience and it all comes in harmony with the word then our words or rather our orders are coming down from the word and we are agreeing with him and we're getting out of the harbor now I love what the protagon said he said now look brother the time has come y'all believe that yes sir we're in the last day we're in the atomic age the time has come they got a weapon they can shake the world from its orbit in five minutes time the sun can cause a total Annihilation and they couldn't have done that before but the time has come amen now right the time has come where there's a fallen away the Bible said except there cometh Fallen away the man sin will not be revealed he said the Pentecostal church is living in the final of all times the time has come the time has come for the signs to fall The Believers we're at the end time we are in the latter rain we're at the time when men will be heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they will be truth Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good hey High minded the time has come when they're teaching doctrines of devils amen perverting the Bible's teaching into theories and theologies amen to draw groups of people away after them the time has come that God will gather his church together under one great big banner of the Lord Jesus Christ and will pour out his powers among them at the same time brother the Merl that they're perverting the Bible they're teaching doctrines of devils is the same time that God is pouring out his spirit and brother Kobe he's Gathering his bride together together not under many banners but under one Banner now come on I might as well preach I'm here we used to be under one banner and it was simply the message of the hour now come on Church y'all remember amen you see a Believer out somewhere and you're just so happy to see a Believer you know why amen because you was under one Banner of the message amen but the devil come in and we got a twoo banner and a Thunders banner and a return Banner and a tape only banner and an intellectual banner and a deep teaching Banner well come on I'm preaching to you now we got all kinds of banners and now nobody know which one to stand under and a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways because one week he's under this banner and the next week he's under that Banner amen but why don't we tear down all them banners and lift up the banner of the message of the hour over the people and gather them under the spirit of God where the powers of God are being poured out and signs and wonders and things are taking place amen the time has come for the Pentecostal Church to make a stand the time has come to circumcise the church and to call out all this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old Landmark the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the Gathering of the people are you ready for this the time has come for Jesus to come the time has come for Jesus to come can I say this he is not coming for dividing church he is not coming for a divided body he is coming for the unified body of the Lord Jesus Christ under the headship or the banner of the word of God now in 1964 brother man preaches a beautiful sermon you know what he calls it he calls it Shalom and he says now this word Shalom actually is a peace greeting and he said now what I'm doing here is saying Shalom to the church right gross darkness is on the people but Shalom to the bride now when brother B preaches shalom in 1964 he introduces to us the thought that God has a great Symphony now when you look at this word Symphony it is an elaborate musical composition it is for full Orchestra now I love this brother Kobe a symphony normally is in typically in four movements at least one of which is traditionally in the not a form now when I read that I'm the guy that says four movements okay now there were four death Messengers that eat the tree down but if this is moving in four if there were four death Messengers eat it down there will be four life Messengers that will restore it back he said now do you know what a symphony is I know you do it's music it's a drama and see they acted out amen now watch this if you have a symphony they're going to play music to act out the symphony in other words you got to have instruments Amen to act out the symphony he said like little Russian Symphony sometimes they act out on the drums you know about the little woodpecker you know got down the woods and they had the fluttering the beating on the drums and things you hear it all as you go to the symphony as they play it I forget the name of it oh yeah Peter and the Wolf that's right amen now watch see they don't have little figures flying around amen play it out but they play it on drums knock some wood together and then knocks on something else see and make the drums and the sounds and things it plays it out amen it acts it out now listen if you're going to have a symphony amen the musicians have got to find the right key if you're going to have a symphony you got to get the musicians in the right key and the part of God said there are people that like to play a piano or music they don't just know how to do it but they go there and the teacher might take a lesson after lesson and they would never learn it see they just cannot hold that key to the mystery of how the Rhythm and the sounds of the tuning and so forth rings out it takes the key so when somebody gets up to sing amen they say give me the key of A or give me the key of C or give me the key of G amen now listen if they're in the key of G and the piano players in the key ofc it's not going to have a pleasing effect but if you get the singer in the same key as the musician amen then there's going to come Harmony I'm preaching to you now do you realize if you're going to have Harmony you got to have more than a solo anybody can sing a solo but if you're going to have Harmony you got to have more than one part which means those multiple Parts have got to come into agreement to make a pleasing effect of sound on the people and the prod God turns and says the word of God is like a great Symphony he said if you don't understand the symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to you if you don't understand it if you don't understand the symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to you it's all done by signs and motions but it acts out a drama in this Symphony he so now we noce the only one that understands the symphony is the composer so the first person that understands the symphony is the composer who wrote it he said and those who are interested in knowing about it amen to know it changes Amen to know what takes place he said the composer the composer he knows every move from the end to the beginning did you know that the one who wrote it up he composes this he knows every little Junction he knows every Junction so does the director have to do ired now watch now watch him he's bringing the spirit of Unity on down so the the composer knows it but now the composure is moving into the director he said now how you going to twist the Creed in that one little miscue of that stick that sign one little Miss sign that djunction with throw the whole Orchestra off would throw the whole Symphony out now you know that's true the composer and the director has to be in the same Spirit he said that's why I'm ministering the word of God God's Great Symphony he's been playing since the B of time the minister at the word has to not look over here and say I believe this ought to be you ought to make it this way he's got to go the way the Sheep music says take it that's the way the gospel has got to be preached the way the word says take it you know if you throw a Creed in there you got the whole thing messed up it's got to go make the drama just exactly right now watch what Paul said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then who shall prepare himself for the battle brother said there's many things that give sounds and there's many uncertain sounds today there is uncertainty on every hand it's uncertainty in everything that you look at amen but there's one thing that's certain and that is in Christ The Gospel has no uncertain sound now the PRT of God Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets said there Seven Seals on the book the book will not the seals will not be released to the message of the seventh angel so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding Vindicated truth now that's exactly what the word says the mystery should be finished at that time so in other words the spirit is coming in the church and is tuning Our Hearts to God so what does the message of the hour do the message of the hour puts us back in Rhythm and in tune with the Sheep music he said when it gets in the right swing of it the right Spirit of it how you going to do the spirit comes down the composure now watch when you say the days of Miracles never passed the symphony Cries Out amen when he hit Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the symphony cries out you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you the symphony cries I got it amen he says amen I got it now listen there's no more guess work about it then the whole symphony is right in harmony with the word brother R claps his hand together three times he says now watch the director the composer must be in the same spirit and so must the musicians be in the same Spirit to act it out he said so in the end time God's Bible and the believer will all come together now can I say this to you in closing amen listen he says to the authentic authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God Amen the bride might say what he says from God the bride will think about saying no that's not what the message says what he says from God the bride will say now watch this amen the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing amen I don't know if you can give it to me or not but the picture there of the pillar of fire over the prophet's head amen the spirit and and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing now watch this and what they say will have already been said in the word now do you remember the prophet God said amen that the composer the M the director and the musician must come in the same spirit amen here he's saying the spirit amen the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing now a lot of people don't like this picture amen but I tell you why they don't like it it's CU they have not received the mind of Christ to Elevate their thinking above the fact that there's a man's picture in the picture but if you'll receive the mind of Christ he will raise your thinking amen above the picture of brother brandom up to the pillar of fire above his head and you will see that that is the composure of the word of God listen friends that is the composer of the Sheep music amen that's not a guesser that's not a hoper amen that is the direct composer of the Sheep music The Man underneath the composer is the the director of the symphony in the last day and he stood up and we are the musicians underneath the composure and the director and we're all in the same spirit and we're all saying the same thing the composer and the director and the musicians will be in the same spirits and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing now What's Happening Here is the purpose of symphony is to bring these three parts into harmony oh God to transform the Sheep music into reality now can you give me Isaiah 12:1 the Bible says in that day Thou shalt say oh Lord I will praise thee though thou was anger with me thine anger is turned away and now Comfort us me behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid are y'all ready for this for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and what else the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song he has also become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation And in that day shall you say praise the Lord not nod not look around in that day you shall say praise the Lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted look at the next verse amen sing unto the Lord now come on church sing unto the Lord for he hath done excellent things that it shall be known in all the Earth cry out and Shout well I don't believe in all that shouting cuz I'm too old no the truth is you're too cold come on church cuz I've seen Elders get under the anointing and Shop their shoe heels off you know why cuz they weren't freezing with theology they were burning with Revelation they had a fire sh up in their bones listen quit letting the devil give you every excuse on why you don't entertain the presence of God just admit it you don't want to but quit getting on the people that do well I feel I taken my Liberty and preaching for a second amen don't get mad cuz we got fire don't get mad listen somebody say well every time they sing that song you don't know like I know what he done for me everybody jumps up and shouts well maybe you don't have nothing to shout about but if you was as lost as I was lost if you was as bound as I was bound if you was as broke as I was broken and the Lord Jehovah come into your midst as the god of the Salvation of the soul and you begin to feel his presence come in the building it'll put a shout in your feet it'll put a clap in your hand it'll put a dance in your step it will put an amen on your lips because Jehovah has come among his church and he said cry out son and Shout aloud amen listen for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee now that word sing means to sing praise are you'all ready for the rest of the definition to make music to play a musical instrument can I say this musical instruments must be in tune now brother wend speaking from experience musical instruments must be in tun so if you're going to have a concert or some if you're goingon to have a group of singers come in brother Kobe they're not going to pull up if the concert starts at 7 they're not going to pull up at 6:30 unload all the music and just get up and start singing they're going to get their hours ahead of time and they're going to tune their instruments they're going to check their soundtracks they're going to have what they call a soundcheck I think we need to start having those in the message again we used to check everything by the word come on Church remember we used to give things the word test amen we didn't give it the personality test brother Mike we gave it the word test but now we give it the personality test but I think we ought to give back together it the word test and if it came pass the word test it shouldn't be on the platform if it can't pass the word test it shouldn't be in our homes it shouldn't be in our lives listen get away from the uncertain sound and get back to a certain sound which is the sound of the revelation of the word of God now they don't get off the bus and just walk in and get up and start strumming instruments and singing songs All Out Of Tune but they get in here and they get all the instruments in tune and they get all their voice voice just blending together and then 7:00 they step up and they begin to sing and you know what happens you begin to enjoy the song that they sing because somebody is in tune can I say this Jehovah has come in this building tonight Jehovah is in this building tonight and brother he wants to sing a song is that okay brother John Jehovah wants to sing a song but guess what he's not wanting to play the song on the piano he's not wanting to play it on the drums he's not wanting to play it on the guitar he's wanting to sing a song but he's wanting to use you as his instruments are you hearing me Jehovah wants to sing a song but he wants to use you as his instruments listen amen if somebody going to sing a song they're going to use the instruments to make the music and if Jehovah wants to sing a song He's going to use you as the instrument listen he wants to sing the song of healing so he's going to use your body to sing it out of he wants to sing the song of Deliverance but he's going to use your body to play the song listen I pray to God we never get so starchy and so cold that Jehovah comes in the church and wants to sing a song and all this must Out Of Tune and they're all warped and bent and one won't speak to the other and one don't like this just let all that go and let our instruments get back in tune so Jehovah can come back in the church and sing his s song he wants to sing I'm a savior he wants to sing I'm a Healer he wants to sing I'm a miracle worker he wants to sing I'm a redeemer but somebody has got to lend their body to God as an instrument in tune to play the song that he wants to sing Listen somebody can sing but if the music doesn't have the tune it's Out Of Tune it's not going to have a pleasing effect now let me close by saying this to you brother tells us a story about an oxin one time he said they were oying off of violin he said the auctioneer stood up there and he held it up and he said what am I offered for this well brother they looked at that violin brother Levi they looked at it and they said you know it's old and crummy and don't look like much couldn't even get a bed on it finally somebody said I'll give you a dollar now watch this the violin Was Out Of Tune the violin was out of Harmony it was at the auction I'm preaching to you now it was at the auction because someone thought this it's finished and we can't get no more music out of it it's finished it's served its purpose it's old it's crummy it's Out Of Tune it's got cobwebs brother said it had scars on it now listen y'all don't y'all don't go buy a brand new Martin guitar amen and two days later send us the auction do you no because it's got value to you but when it looks like it has no more value you get rid of it so somebody thought this violin was finished brother Miguel there could be no more music come out of it but watch a problem but there was one standing there that didn't think it ought to sell for that so he went over and picked it up and he struck in his hand and he picked up the bow and rosing it and he played a tune and when he did everyone started crying and the auctioneer said what am I offered and somebody said 2,000 somebody else said 5,000 somebody else said 10,000 said see what was it the Master's Hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument it was finished it was done brother Robert amen but God who is rich in Mercy said it shouldn't sell for that come on church and the prod of God said this he said this book is ragged it's been laughed at been made fun of it's at the domination auction today the roal Council of churches he said but remember remember there is something in the old book that promised there would be a predestinated hand ordained hand come one day that would pick it up and make the word of this book through a pre destinated heart to the task it's made for reveal the promises that's in it it might look like an old bunch of Holy Rollers or something other but it just takes the Master's Hand the word on it to reveal the word are you ready for that and it becomes more than a Holy Roller well glory to God when the master gets a hold of it it becomes more than a Holy Roller it becomes that to every one of us hasn't it friends it's not a bunch of fanaticism are you ready for this it depends on Whose hand the bow is in now I'm breaking it down to you brother said the violin was the word and he said the violin was on The Oxen block he said but now watch amen a violin must have a bow oh God a violin must have a bow you can have the violin but if you don't have the bow you cannot bring the music out of the violin so the violin is the Bible the violin is the message but Church you are the bow are you hearing me you are the bow and the prodag God said see the bow the True Believer now what does that do I'm paraphrasing here the bow brings out the music of the violin in other words the master tuned it up and put it back to its original condition and he laid oh God William brandham took this Bible and he laid it on his shoulder and he took your life and laid your life on this violin and he begin to strum across it and out of your life he begin to sing the the song Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he began to sing the song God is the god of Salvation he begin to sing the song I'm a deliverer I'm a way maker I'm a miracle worker listen you left the devil tell you God can't get no more music out of you but I defy that devil in the name of Jesus Christ and I say holy ghost rising up the bow and laying across the message and bring some music out of New Life like they ain't heard in a long time well glory to God said oh God step forth send us that prophet he said oh can't you hear the Master's violin the bow across this word he's the same yesterday today and forever you are the bow oh God and he took your life brother Wendell he he took that violin and he took your life and he laid your life right over that and it began to pull back and forth and as he begin to pull back and forth there begin to become an agreement between the strings and the bow and Jehovah begin to sing a song What About You Joe what about you Stephanie amen the devil said you was finished the devil didn't see no purpose amen but God did so God sent a prophet before the foundation of the world to take this Bible and listen listen I know sometimes you may you may think that well nobody knows about us or nothing amen but can I tell you something amen God took your lives and he rened up the bows and he laid it across the Bible and God has used your life as an instrument to sing the song of Deliverance and the song of creation power around the world what about it Miguel amen it ain't done till God says it's done he took your life and laid you back on the violin and began to sing a song of restoration and power what about it Kobe he took your life as the bow and laid you across that word and begin to sing the song of a miracle working God what about you Josh amen with all your life and all the things you've been through but God took you as a bow and laid you across the word and sending you around the world preaching the gospel amen singing the song What About It Austin what about it Dylan if may not look good in the world times but God got a hold of you boys and he laid you across this bat are you hear me I'm not a crazy man and if he did it for them he can do it for you don't matter what kind of home you come out of don't matter what kind of broken past you God if God wants to get some music amen out of your life he'll tune you up and he'll play the song of his grace and his mercy and his healing power through your life what about it brother Merl what about it sister Leah amen God could take your lives amen All Out Of Tune and all kinds of hardships and all kinds of disappointments amen amen all kinds of things against you amen but right here amen God can still take your life and he can lay you across this pull pit and he can sing a song through you what about it sister Leah he can bring you up here and lay your life across this word and sing a song out of you I'm not talking about a song I'm talking about anointed song What About It Robert amen he can come get you in a youth camp can you buddy he can come save your soul he can come deliver you from the things of the world and give you a wife and give you a family and give you the Holy Ghost I'm talking about a God that has the power to come in the church through the harmony of the Supernatural and break down the strongholds and bring us Victory like you never seen I say oh God tune us up again Lord tune us up again so we can play the song of [Applause] Jehovah what about it Caleb amen it looked like it was over for you buddy amen but somewhere there was a Praying mama and a praying Daddy and God got a hold of you and he laid your life across this pilin and gave you wife and gave you babies and gave you a future you know why

get some Harmony Back get rid of your critical ideas and get some Harmony Back Where God can do some things brother Robert you forgive me am remember I remember the night I was there I remember that night amen there weren't a bunch of people sitting around criticizing and arguing doctrines and arguing the approach over this and arguing the scripture over that amen there was some people that was together that see the power of God come in a youth camp and heal somebody's life and it just so happened to be your night that God come down and because somebody was in tune with the Supernatural come on new life he did that in your church he did that for your people if he did it before he can do it again because he's God I say let's get so in tune that we can see some more prodical come home let's get so in tune that we can see some more deliverances we can see some more Supernatural victories in the house of God let our musicians come tonight Hallelujah I'm talking about getting in harmony with God hallelujah talking about getting in harmony with God I'm talking about remembering what it was like when the Holy Ghost come among the church and things begin to change sister Jalene I remember I remember down here few years ago and the doctor said it was cancer and said all these things was going on but I remember some Holy Ghost filled family members all kinds of reports stacking up and all kinds of situations but some somebody rose up and said we're going to believe God and 30 40 50 60 years ago a prophet stood and he took the violin off the denominational auction and he tuned it up and he said Isaiah 53 is still in there and a predestinated hand took members of your family and took you yourself and laid you right across this violin and begin to sing the song I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases and she sits there today completely free of that devil you know what done it somebody was in tune with God I'm not a crazy man but there's television pictures going right through this room right [Music] now there's somebody down the road watching television brother Donald they ought to be in church but they're watching television and what they're watching is
