We just thank you for all of your grace in the name of the Lord Jesus. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. Well, good evening. Good to be in the house of the Lord today. And um I um totally forgot to uh uh wish brother Paul a happy birthday this morning. 14 years old. He turned yesterday [Applause] and um so we wish you a happy birthday. And um I wonder if we could just sing that sing a happy birthday song to brother brother Paul. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you brother Paul. Happy birthday brother Paul and Casper. Happy birthday to you. May Jesus bless you. May Jesus bless you. May Jesus bless brother Paul Lancaster the whole year through. God bless you. I want to tell you, brother Paul is a very fine young man and uh we love him. And so my goodness, he just told him today just growing up too fast. And um so we love we love brother Paul. Let's look here while we're while we're standing. Let's just look at St. John the 3 chapter. Just going to read the 16th verse. And um um we uh sure appreciate the meal today. Thanks for for the hard work and and um and it's just it was just wonderful. Thanks to all you all you ladies. We love you. Now um St. John uh 3:16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. He that believes on him is not condemned, but he that believes not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. This is the condemnation. Now, he's going to tell us why the condemnation is there. That light is come into the world and men loves darkness more than light because their deeds were evil. For everyone that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds be reproved, but he that do the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be manifest, that they are wrought in God. Let's go to the Lord in prayer once again. Father, we just want to thank you for your goodness and for your love. Now Lord, we just ask that you would help us these next few moments. Lord, as I give myself to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be seated here this evening. So God gives Amen. God so loved. God so loved that he gave. Amen. Now we find as we as we look here this morning, Amen. the great the great uh redemption plan, the red redemptive plan of God and how that God had to create a body. Amen. For him to move in. And we we remember that, Amen. the DNA of God was all in that great pillar of fire. And that great pillar of fire overshadowed the womb of Mary. Amen. And and what was it? It was God continuing on. God becoming flesh. God coming on down. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was the invisible God. And then God, Amen. brought a form out of himself. Out of God comes this form. And God moves into that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he's working through prophets and he's declaring that he's coming. A body is coming. He's declaring a virgin's going to conceive. He's he's showing all of these things. These are all prophetic. It's all the logos that's coming down until it comes to the to to Mary. And then the one who gave the promise. Now remember, 800 years ago, a virgin shall conceive. I'm going to give you a sign. 800 years ago. Amen. Uh that this is when Jesus time, not 800 years ago for us, but 800 years before Jesus. Amen. Uh um and and a son is going to be born and you're going to call him the everlasting father, the almighty God. You're going to call him the prince of peace. God's declaring, "Amen, as I have come out of the invisible, now I'm here in the pillar of fire. Israel can see me." Amen. They followed the pillar of fire by day. The prophets all seen that great pillar of fire. The power of God was with that pillar of fire. Elijah seen and was even caught up in that pillar of fire. Moses was caught up into the fire when he received the law. Amen. But now it's going to keep on coming down and down until it's in the body of Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ is going to hold all of the DNA of God. Amen. The glory of God and God is going to be made. And that's what the scripture said. In the beginning was the word. Uh John 1 and 1. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. And all things were created by him. And without him was not anything that was made. 14th verse. Now, amen. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. God becoming human, God come coming on down and down and down and down until he walked on earth with us. until we could see in our own human eyes. Amen. Uh um uh there in in uh 1 John 1 and1, Sister Kala. Amen. We could see the word. Amen. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. This was John saying we seen this word in a body. We see we held him. We we went we went fishing with him. We we were there when he multiplied the loaves. We were there when he fed the the the the 5,000. Amen. We literally seen the word made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to the lamb of God. You see, that's what God had been wanting to do all along. But you see, then after religion comes, religion wants to just make us, Amen, just church people come and sit down in a church and just worship a God of way back there yesterday. But God wants to be not just in Jesus of 2,000 years ago, but the whole plan of redemption was that they would go, remember when Jesus raised from the dead. Amen. And he tells them and and as as we have dealt with lately, he tells them, "Go back to Jerusalem." And what does he do? The Bible says he &gt;&gt; blows on them and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit. Receive." Amen. Go back and look at it and it says the breath of God, the very thing that caused the logos, the very Christ, he says, "Go to Jerusalem into that upper room until you receive this very thing that made Jesus who he was." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how much the Apostle Paul says. He says, "You have received the very spirit of Christ." Look at it in your Bible. Amen. He You have received the spirit of Christ. What is he saying? The very thing, the very logos in the beginning that created the whole world, the very thing that is sustaining the world, the very thing that is that is causing Amen. the prophets to speak over 1600 years and none of them in this Bible ever missed it. And I want to say even the prophecies of this day today. There are prophecies that are going on right now that was spoken thousands. How could these guys do it? It was that logos of God. It was what God said in the beginning. He's he listen there is no guessing because God has no tomorrows. God has no yesterdays. &gt;&gt; God is in the right now and he's making himself known to mortals like me and you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. See, he didn't leave us. Now, every other religion, you are worshiping uh you're worshiping the sun. You're worshiping the moon or you're worshiping a a a a creature. You you are you you are worshiping a you know you can worship anything. But this God, the God of all gods, is not wanting us just to to come to church to worship. He wants to worship with his people. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say now now how no no no. God don't want to worship with his people. Well, let's just all turn there real quick. Let's look here in the book of Hebrews. Amen. And we'll look. Hebrews 2. Amen. Oh, how many loves him? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, if we go to Hebrews and let's just start, man, two and five. But unto the angels, has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak? For but one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Were the Son of man that thou should visit him? Thou madeest him a little lower than the angels. Thou thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set him over the work of of thy hands. Talking about Adam, Adam had the authority. Adam walked with God. Adam was made in the image of God. Now watch. &gt;&gt; He says he says um uh thou hast put all things in subjection under him. &gt;&gt; For him that he he put all in subjection under him. He left nothing that is not under him. But now we see uh not yet all things put under him. In other words, since the fall, here we are. We've been in our uh uh we've been in limbo. We we've been in But watch. Amen. We we see not yet all things put under him. But we see Jesus. Now he's saying now man's not where he once was, but we see Jesus. Now watch this. Keep that in mind. Who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For it become him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory. Now watch. Man was given that by God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sin come in. Amen. He lost that position. God in his great mind coming down. Coming down to redeem that God in a body put Amen. died on the cross for you and for me so that he can bring you and me back into the glory that we fell from. Do you want to know why? You want to know why Satan has come in this last day the way he has? Amen. With drugs. Listen, there there it's the statistics say that there are uh uh uh one out of three uh Americans that are that are uh uh that are dependent on drug. Uh uh these are these are from from the doctors. And and so that's that's quite a that that that's quite an astounding thing because the majority Amen. We got drugs for everything. Everything's for Amen. And and and and I I I look at this here. We are right at the end of the day where it takes away our desperation the way that we really need it. &gt;&gt; Because desperation desperation you don't you don't you don't hear of deathbed confessions anymore. Why? Because we have got we have got drugs in our system. Amen. And to where they'll just put you to sleep and you'll just go right on into the glory. I don't care. Or into eternity. And it doesn't matter whether you're a sinner or a saint. Where it used to be. Amen. As you were dying, the sinner would find out, listen, I need to make things right with God. I need to be right. But you see these kinds of things because Satan is trying to numb our expectations for what God is asking us to be. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to numb those things. But I just want to tell you, don't let the devil numb anything on you &gt;&gt; because we are in a day where we are fixing to take over the earth again. &gt;&gt; Authority belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. He gets us. He He wants to get us sidetracked from our purpose. You are the rapturing people. &gt;&gt; Amen. I truly believe that. &gt;&gt; I truly believe there are people sitting in this building tonight that will not see death. The rapture is upon us. We are at this finality. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now I want you to catch this because G, they're going to This is We're fixing to see why Jesus came. Amen. Man fell from that. He was favored of God. Fell from that. Jesus came. Amen. Now, let's let's let's start reading again. It says um for it be the 10th verse. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For both he that sanctifies, that's him, and they who are sanctified, that's us, are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren. Christ Jesus is not ashamed to call you brethren. &gt;&gt; He became one of us, saying, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, and in the midst of the church, my brethren, will I sing praise unto thee." It's not just God coming, Christ coming and revealing himself to his brethren, but in the midst of the church will he sing praise to him. &gt;&gt; How is this happening? The great God of glory living in you &gt;&gt; until your praise becomes his praise. Until your hands become his hands. Until your Amen. until you becomes you become the very body of that logos. Amen. It is your will to do his will. It is your desire. Amen. He heals the sick through you. He forgives through you. He loves through you. He manifests himself to a dying world through you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, don't ever let me get numb to that precious call. Can you say amen? Amen. Now, now he says, "I will declare," 12th verse, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, and in the midst of the church will I sing unto thee. And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, behold, I am the children which God hath given me. For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, me and you, he also likewise, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver them who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. Verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things, somebody say all things, it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to secure them that are tempted. &gt;&gt; I say, put that in your pipe and smoke it, devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. That makes something really special out of you. We're just I know we're just a bunch of uh uh uh you know rejects maybe from the world and maybe we don't have nice homes or nice cars and maybe maybe we don't we don't fit in with the world in a in a lot of ways. But I tell you what, we fit in with heaven. &gt;&gt; We fit in with heaven. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And he's working his work through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want to say, Lord, I want to reflect that image of Christ. If I have been born again, and Sister Keys, could you put up number six? Amen. If I have been born again, and again, the DNA was put in your heart before the foundation of the world. The Bible says it was declared that. It was already put there. God knew you were coming. He knew Wendle Martin would be on this earth in a fallen condition. God seen me. God seen me right here talking to you. God knew I was going to stand just like this at this very moment. &gt;&gt; God knows it all. &gt;&gt; And God knew I was going to be here. God put his seed in me. The genetics of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now Jesus though he had the genetics of God, he done no miracles. He done nothing nothing until birth or or or until when he was baptized. So remember the genetics of God if you want to go to the seventh that that seventh slide. Amen. Now now we he couldn't put it there in the you know fallen on Mary because we didn't want to deify Mary. So we just put it in the baby there. But it was the seed of God. Amen. that came in and and brought the son of God that brought Jesus. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. The next slide is when Jesus was at the river, then then the Holy Spirit comes down and energizes that predestinated seed of God that was in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, you were the predestinated seed. You were ordained of God, but you had to receive the Holy Spirit. And when it energized that seed, then you become that. Are y'all understanding? &gt;&gt; See, we were born with the genetics of God in our soul. &gt;&gt; But it took the Holy Spirit to come in and make it. And then he comes out of the water tempted by the devil. Amen. But he had all power of heaven and earth within him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so I say I want I I I I want us to just think for a moment. Not going to hold you long tonight. Just want to sort of end up on some things that I didn't finish this morning. And that is my purpose, my goal. If Christ had the DNA of God, if Christ had the DNA of God and the I was in that Christ chosen in him, then I just want to say my purpose here on earth is not just to be amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is a supernatural eternal effect that is that is within every one of you. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said as he was as he was about to uh go to Calvary. Amen. And and and we can read it for a moment there there in in St. John the 13th chapter and um uh see 13 and 1 it says now before the feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was about to come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them to the end and supper being ended and the devil having put into the heart of Judas's scar Simon's son to betray him but Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God. He rises from supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girded himself. And after that he pours water into a basin and begins to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was gird girded. And then Peter uh then he come to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him,"Lord, what does thou wash my feet?" And Jesus answered and said, "What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter." If you go down to the 12th verse, he said, "After he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sitting down again, he said, "Know ye what I have done to you. You call me master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than him that sent him. If you know these things, happy are you if you do them. Now Jesus is here saying now he's he's showing us the part of God that he's come he was the servant. He was God's expression. He was reflecting the image. Many times we want to reflect you know Christians want to reflect an image. You know as I said this morning by wearing a certain cloth or clothing or wearing a cross or a crucifixion in your home or your car going to church. But but that's not the reflection. That's not the reflection that we're looking for is that word reflection. What God has been desiring to do all along. And that is the ministry of reconciliation. Amen. The image. Remember, he was the image of that invisible God. What did he reflect? He reflected God's God's heart. Look, look there at 2 Corinthians 5:18. He says, "All things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation, to God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation." This is pretty astounding because God was willing to come in a body to give his life unjustly. &gt;&gt; He was killed wrongfully. &gt;&gt; He'd done no sin. But the Bible says he did not hold their trespasses against them, but he forgave them in saying, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do." And then he says he's giving you this ministry of reconciliation to where you can reflect that heartbeat of God &gt;&gt; just as well. Philippians 2:5 says, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made of himself no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant made in the likeness of men." Can you say amen? I look at Paul and he says, "Though I speak with tongues of men and angels and I don't have love, I become a sounding brass and tinkling symbol. For though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love, I am nothing. Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not love, it profits me nothing. When you think of Christ, what do you think? Love. Love. And so as I as I as we leave the building here tonight, I want us to think about the the nature of that of the genetics that are within your soul. I want you to think about that &gt;&gt; and don't ever come to the reality we are or don't don't ever yeah numb to the reality of what you're called for &gt;&gt; to forgive is God to reconcile is the nature of God. Can you say amen? Because remember, Amen. the the the scripture lets us know that Christ was that very image of God. He was the expression of God in flesh. He was the mercy of God. He was the compassion of God. He was the judgment of God. He was Amen. you you know as I said we used to think that God loves me and Jesus or God hates me he's mad at me and Jesus loves me and we found out that Jesus is simply the body that God used to come and redeem me &gt;&gt; that didn't take away from his justice. Justice still had to be paid. &gt;&gt; But he was willing to pay the justice when we couldn't do it. Can you say amen? He was willing to do what it took to bridge the gap when you couldn't bridge the gap. &gt;&gt; And I say sometimes we get a little bit we get a little bit arrogant, don't we? &gt;&gt; We get a little bit arrogant. We stand on our side and we say, "Hey, you know what? You have got you you you have fallen short or you have hurt me or you have done this to me and and I I I'm requiring you to do this." But God did not do that. &gt;&gt; When God's law was broke, God gave man the authority. God was good to place him there. And when man blew it all, he blew the whole thing. &gt;&gt; And there was nothing that a man could do. God was willing &gt;&gt; to bridge the gap, come himself, pay the price to bring reconciliation back to mankind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If God can do that, if the great eternal God can do that, Amen. then then how about God's great divine Amen. God uh uh for you and me? &gt;&gt; What what what what if God can do that for for a man? Amen. Then what what what about you and me doing that for one another should I see? The Bible says there in Isaiah 53 and and and three, he is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him. This is talking about the Christ when he come. We He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was put upon him and with his stripes we are healed. All we have like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. But the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. He was oppressed. He was afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth. He has brought as a lamb to the slaughter. As a sheep before his sheers is dumb. So we openeth not his mouth. When Christ came, he expressed the heartbeat of God. It was a servant's life. He come not to be ministered to but to minister. Jesus told him, he says, "Now, amen." He says, "Don't be many masters." Don't be many masters. He says masters come and want to be served. But he says God's not called us to be many masters. You're not come to be lorded uh to lord over others. Amen. But he says you've come to serve. &gt;&gt; You've come to give. And then when giving, you're expressing something. Can I can I put it back as I was saying this morning? Logos is no longer logos. The word, this word is no longer logos in the church because they've got their own ideas and opinions that's with it. So the logos, but see the logos will still line up with this. It'll bring the thoughts of God into the pages of God. And as you're believing that, you line your thoughts up with that, it will produce the eternal living word. It'll heal. Come on now. God's not made us to hate. God's not made us to demand our own selves. Oh, come on. Only the sick need attention. It's the sick that demand attention. You you you get a man that's demanding attention, demanding his rights, demanding her rights. &gt;&gt; That that man is sick. &gt;&gt; He's He's looking at himself. &gt;&gt; He's not looking at what God's called him to do. And as long as you're looking inwardly and not outwardly, then you can never fulfill your purpose. But God's come so that he can fulfill his purpose through us. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world that he came. And this is the condemnation that light has come. But man wants to walk in darkness because his deeds are evil and they don't want him to be made reproved or made right. Right. But there's someone with the DNA of God when the light comes that says, "Oh, get me out of this bondage. Get me out of this bondage. I want to be free with everything. Every God, free me." Oh, how many wants God to free you here this morning? Take every grudge away. Take every take take every Oh, take all my sicknesses away. Hallelujah. I I I like it this way here. Amen. When When you're anemic, what when when you're anemic, that means Amen. You're low on blood. And there's I think there's too many of too too many in the church that gets a little low on blood. The the Amen. low on the blood of Jesus. Low low on the forgiveness. Low on the And when you get low on blood, it's just hard to overlook your your your your fellow man. But if you're not careful, the bitterness will take you right out of what God is trying to do in your life. If God's trying to do something in you and you just remember and it don't matter whether you're a pastor, it don't matter whether you're you're a spiritual person that's been serving the Lord for 50 years, Satan will do whatever he can to make you bitter. And if he can make you bitter, it'll take the very life of God out of you. And when he takes the life of God of you, you're useless. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can sit there and point and condemn. But the law was doing that before grace ever got here. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the law was telling everybody where they're wrong. But it takes grace. It takes the reflection of that invisible God, that great God coming down, down, down, down, down, down, and living in me. Now I can live the life and reflect &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus. &gt;&gt; See? Oh yes. &gt;&gt; That's what God wants. Amen. Prophet says, "Brethren, we have draws little circles and laws and different things and we've still never come to the real kernel. It's Jesus Christ, the love of God that God wants us to see." What a pity. Love is the greatest and the most powerful weapon that the world has ever seen or known of. It's dying for love. The church is perishing for love. the love of God's waters of grace to flow one to another when confidence is restored, when justice is restored between us. The love of God that shed abroad in our hearts. He says uh uh it says love of God shed abroad in our hearts by denomination. He goes something sounds sounded wrong there, didn't it? The love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit. Another place he said he was just a man, the perfect man. He gave us life. He made an example for you. Now uh now what must we do? The first thing I want to say is he never lived for himself. His life was spent for others. That's perfectly eternal life. When you say you go to church and you and and you do good things, that's fine. But when you live your life to yourself, you don't have eternal life. Eternal life is living for others. It proved it when he come in the lamb of God. He lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself. He lived for others. And when you receive eternal life by receiving that day, you don't live for yourself no more. You live for others. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. carriers of life, the blood cell of God in our hearts that's been broken by the DNA of God. The life of God has come in. Amen. And has ignited those dramatized those seeds. &gt;&gt; Now mercy is for us. Can you say amen? Matthew 5:38, "You have heard it been said, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. But I say in you, I say unto you, that ye resist not evil. But whosoever smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. If any man sue thee at law, and take away thy coat, give him your cloak also. Whosoever compel thee to go a mile, go with him, too. Give to him that askketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, and turn not away. You have heard, and it's been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, love your enemy, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them which despise, despitefully use you and persecute you. Can you say amen? The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 4:7, he gives he gives the secret, but we have this treasure. Hallelujah. Put that number six back up there. We have this treasure in earthn vessels. &gt;&gt; That the excellency slide number six that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. We are troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. Persecuted but not forsaken. Cast down but not destroyed. always bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. That's that's scripture. Amen. That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. You love him. &gt;&gt; So, as we go to work this week or we go and raise our families, let's keep the gospel simple. &gt;&gt; Let's keep it simple. God, I want your life living in me. and anything that would try to come as a wedge between my love for God and my wedge as a my love for my family, my wife, my husband, my children. If there's even my enemies, if I begin to hate my enemies, God forgive me and help me. Let me have grace to love. I want to express that image. How many believe that's a good idea? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the musicians would come, aren't you glad that the life, &gt;&gt; eternal life expressed in you, Amen. If you don't enter into the fellowship, if something in you doesn't cry out for each other, if something doesn't project love, you know, people aren't so foolish as they understand whether you're putting on or not. They understand it. Wildlife understands it. You have to enter into that fellowship. But I just want to tell you, I'm so glad that Jesus didn't just declare it to his brethren, but he come and lived in the midst of his brethren. He's declaring the praises through you. &gt;&gt; He's the anointing upon you where the glor Oh my goodness. Oh, if we could just see it. his glory, his love. Oh hallelujah. Flow through me, Holy Spirit. You know that song. Flow through me, Holy Spirit. Flow through me. [Music] flow through. Holy Spirit flow through me as I hand to worship &gt;&gt; and to magnify [Music] the name. Lord through me. Holy Spirit. Does Christianity just become a duty to you? Do you come to church cuz it's a duty? Or do we come to come into his presence? We come to enter into his presence to seek to remove every obstacle out of our way to know his presence is touching me. [Music] Is our prayer life out of duty? Or is it because we want to come in contact with that great glorious God? [Music] It's not duty. [Music] It becomes your duty because as you come before him, then you understand there's some things that must be put at first. Churches should be the utmost importance. And when we come, Eman, our our desire is is to fellowship with God. And we're just going to make sure that we're ready. We're a living body. It's our It's our desire. It's our It's our call. It's who we are. Do we tolerate one another as a duty or do we [Music] Do we genuinely love one another? Because duty can only go so far. And after a while, you get burned out and you say, "Okay, this is it. I'm finished. This is done." [Music] But when there's a genuiness of God that we come into that realization that I'm a part of a something eternal, you're a part of something eternal. And I need you and you need me. And I'm not going to let any devil separate us. I'm not going to let anything come in between me and you. And our God has placed us in baptized into us into his body by one spirit that great eternal logos that great eternal holy spirit upon us. I want then it be does become a duty. I then you become my duty. I I don't want no devil coming against you. I don't want no devil. No no no no no no. Then there's a living force. Oh God, I want that. God, let me so baptize me again. Let your Holy Spirit renew me. Renew me. Oh, there's one filling and many refillings. We we we we need that refilling of his Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. Can Can you say amen to where it's just God? I want to be that reflection. Let me be that reflection. Let me be that reflection. Oh, not to just have the duty of being a preacher, a pastor, a a a a husband, a father, but oh, let me be a reflection of your glory right here. You You've called me to res. You've restored me. You brought many sons under glory, bringing many sons back into that relationship. Let it be in me. Let it be. Satan, you tried to take one of my one of my brothers or sisters and you're going to have to deal with me. Amen. You're going to have to deal with me. I'm going to pray. I'm going to do what it takes. Satan, you try to take me away and numb my mind and my heart from the realities of Jesus. I'm going to say Satan, not anymore. Not anymore. He's come to redeem me. I'm not looking at myself anymore. I I'm going to look at the grace of God and say, "God, help me." Oh, I'm going to look for somebody. Somebody the grace of God live through me, flow through me, manifest through me. Declare your glory through me. Let me be a visible expression of Jesus. Hallelujah. Holy Spirit, flow through me.

Do a do a surgery upon our hearts and take all those roots of bitterness out of us, Lord. what you do is good and pure. We love you, Father. Thank you for your grace. Thank you for your mercies. Bless this congregation, Lord. Everyone's going to go home to work, raise families, going to be on the job. Mama's taking care of their children, children in school.

Oh, I love you for you are mine. Yes, Jesus. I love you for you. [Music] I love you forever. [Music] You are Jesus. [Music] Now, if you want to keep this presence, see, God doesn't want us to be renewed and then we're on top of the mountain for three weeks, four weeks, and then go back down in the valley and stay there again. We feel good. We're loving everybody, and then we go back down, and then we're all hating everybody. God wants his Holy Spirit to bring us out of this thing. And let's walk with him. Did you know that's part of being worthy of the call? If you would look that up there, Sister Clea, just real quick as we dismiss Ephesians 4 and one, and read re look at this here. He says, I beseech you, brethren, uh it says, "Therefore, the the prisoner of the Lord, I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation." That word vocation, amen, is God's invitation to embrace. Amen. So he says, I beseech you to walk worthy of the invitation to embrace salvation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Now, now this is this is this is he says now you've got to walk worthy. If God has called you and you love his presence and you love what he's doing for you, then you've got to walk worthy of that call. You can't continue this other route. He's inviting you into this reconciliation. So remember, it's an honor that God's called us and invited us into. It's a great honor. Amen. God bless you. I love every one of you. Amen. I love him with all of my heart. And I love you with all of my heart. We pray for you every day. Believing God for great things for every one of you. Amen. Remember Sister Denise and and and Sister Angie as as both of them are sick. Let's just keep on praying for them. those that aren't here tonight. Amen. Just just reach out to them and let them know that you missed them. Amen. Praise the Lord. God richly richly bless you today. I love this feeling. I love the presence of God. I want it to go home with me. I want it to be in my home. I want it to be on the job. I I want it to be with me wherever I go. You can take this presence with you now. It's not just for here. You carry the anointing. You're the son of God. It is Jesus who died. God bless you. As you're dismissed, you dismiss yourselves. [Music] Oh, I love him for he is mine. I remember this the the sister Brianna and and uh brother Robert as they are leaving out tomorrow. Brother Williams on his way to come and pick them up. He and Sister Sharon and then they're going to be traveling to the Carolas to be with the family. So let's let's let's keep Briana, Sharon, and a word. Uh all all that whole family, Esther, the boys. Let's just pray for that whole family. Oh, I love him for he is mine. [Music] I love him for he is divine. [Music] I love him forever. It's true. He is Jesus who died.
