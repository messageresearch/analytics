tonight not under the the name of a message or under the name of a denomination but under the name of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen amen amen well you may be seated I'm going to show a few pictures and things of my trip um my first time doing something like this so you got to bear with me um but first of all I would like to thank everybody for y'all's prayers and and the support that y all y'all gave and it was a blessing the offering y'all took up was a a major blessing those who have been on trips before it adds up you got you're paying for your own tickets your own hotels the foods uh uh the interpreters and everything so the offering y'all gave was was such an incredible incredible blessing and so if you're if you're ready for it if it hopefully it'll all all work and so anyways this here is brother Allan here on the left that is the pastor's son brother Allan Lopez um he was the the one that's over the camp and everything the one in the middle is brother Joseph that was my translator uh for most of the week he he went everywhere with me U so that was that was a incredible blessing on the on the white as brother jonen um that was my chauffeur my driver most of everybody up there drives dirt bikes uh insurance and gas and things is is pretty expensive up there and actually uh I seen a family of five show up on a dirt bike at church you know and so so anyways but Joon and had a car um so this is my hotel room for the first couple of nights just something simple but hey there is AC and so I was happy for it and so and if you inside the bathroom there you see the little toilet paper hope it's still just the little little trash can hope this don't disgust yall out but you're not allowed to flush the toilet paper and so you got to put it inside the little trash can and I'm telling you what it took me a little bit to remember that I think I about call calls the Nationwide sew problem but uh we we finally got through it this is the outside of my hotel room it's a little eaten area you would walk out go to the window and order some food um this is on the outside I know it's on the sideways so that's what it look like on the outside of my hotel room a little a little rough but the hotel was a little a little gated thing there so you was perfectly safe this is a little traffic jam um through the the the streets of Manawa you can see that the GU put pushing a cart on the right and the guy in the middle I don't know what he's pushing there's a guy on the left on a donkey and so we're in a car trying to get through all of that so it was definitely definitely an experience um this here is the highest peak in Manawa the little girl is uh was brother Jonah's little daughter and so it's a beautiful scene right now the picture don't do it justice but it's all the lights and everything this is called a a a capernum if I can say that right that's a public transportation there in manwa a lot of the people can't afford cars and things so that's what they drive back and forth to work so we got to ride on one uh quite interesting really bumpy I think I got a video of us on it uh that's brother uh Joseph my interpreter then yeah there's the This Is Us going through downtown area there um there was nice parts of Manawa this is the capital city of Nicaragua um do you have that next one of us on it okay it's fine let's go to the next one but we got the right of this here is like their Central Park they would say and and it's normally more busier than this um this was late that night but you see all the trees lit up and things they said it's it's supposed to represent the tree of life and so that all downtown Manawa is nothing but those trees and there's toys I actually got a couple toys for the kids there but it's pretty neat just to experience some of their culture there you can go to the next one there we go that's on the the Caper yeah I think thing was pretty neat uh hot you can fill the engine a dirt bike behind you and it's a little basket in front and really bumpy I'm telling you what it's pretty neat getting to getting to see I think I turn the camera around here here here in a minute so you can s of see see the set yeah that's just the dirt bike behind it shifting gears as we're going go go to next this is Brother Allan so this is on Sunday um he is he's picking me up well he him and brother Jonah's picking me up we we were going to a service I didn't preach at his church but I preached at one of the local churches there um brother Sylvia if you can go to the next one that's brother Sylvia and it's it's it's always nice whenever you see the the picture of brother Brandon in a church you know so that's brother Sylvia and man this is uh his congregation as you can see there's there's windows but no glass so everything is open air and man we had a a wonderful time there I I really didn't know how they took it they were really reserved and and just just watching you know and it was at the camp brother Sylvia was there and he he was saying that you know CU he didn't say much at the at the meeting at that at the service at all he just thank you for coming you know so I was really wondering what was going on if if they were agreeing what I was preaching because I was preaching message pretty heavy and at the camp he would come up and would said you our elders have been talking about what your message the things you've been saying this is exactly what we've been needing what we've been praying for we want you to come back so that was encouraging that we wasn't just a waste of trip you know just sweating our our high end off you know just it was encouraging to hear that this is what we've been wanting I did my first baby dedication that was was interesting I'm sitting there in the office and the couple comes up and you know they're speaking to the translator and Brother Joseph goes well they want you to be dedicate their baby I said well if if you feel comfortable doing I well I've never done it before the little boy's name was Ethan so that was easy to remember and so yeah that that definitely was an interesting experience for me this is uh brother Manuel this is Brother Allen's father so he's the host pastor of the camp so we after our service that Sunday we would go over to his Fellowship Hall which is just this is their kitchen um that's just mud and and Clay packed together that's their stove there all their water is all on on the outside that's their Fellowship Hall just some tin you know some curtains dividing and things you know and I was telling telling Dad we we sort of get spoiled here our fellowship all we got electricity water inside you know so that that is what they gather in and in fellowship with and things this here is brother Allen's house now this really struck me you know as you at the very top there's a gap all the way around you know Cedar blocks all the way up there's 10 on the top but there's a gap like this all the way around that house and that's what they live in you know that's his freezer his water as you can see the the concrete is wet his sink is to the left of of the picture there which is on the on the porch and brother Zachary actually goes up here a lot this is where he missionaries a lot and they said Zachary put a hammock on their porch and slept there for like three or four days you know so I had a good time but I was in a hotel room Zachary is the the real deal he goes in the jungles this is Brother Paco so this is the brother that brother Zachary goes with um whenever he goes missionary and goes in all the all over uh South America that's that's who he goes with so this is the start of the camp this is on Monday night and so we had a total of well we I preached every day Sunday to Friday so this is Monday night the start of the camp and it started out really slow I we was hitting hitting a wall I preached Monday night and Tuesday morning then brother Solomon Huffman was there as well he preached Tuesday night Wednesday morning so that that's how the order of the services went so this is Monday night and man I I'm preaching and laboring there about 45 minutes into it it's starting to to break a little bit I'm halfway down the aisle and my microphone dies or brother Paco's microphone dies so I give him my microphone and my voice just completely rips and goes out so we ended up having to just close the service and speaking of my voice I forgot to add this part um the Sunday before I left to Nicaragua I preached a couple services and my voice was completely gone I woke up the next morning with the Cod my voice was gone all through that week and I knew I had seven services to preach that that that coming week and man and the family started to pray and I woke up that morning feeling great so the Lord was gracious to us so I lost my voice again but the Lord was gracious to give it back this is in the all little office area it's the cafeteria brother Paco there uh looking over some notes and things brother Solomon and brother brother Joseph I believe that was on Tuesday Tuesday night this is the the the building I guess the awning we was having Church in it's just a little gymnasium open open sides and things it it was in January but it was still hot you know' 70s 80s and humidity like crazy so this is Brother Solomon he plays piano I'm on the base this is one of the the young ladies that are singing We actually would sing a song together um she tried teaching me to sing in Spanish but I tried and I could not figure it out for the life of me um this is their musicians and every service they would alternate a different song leader different and each one of them is on different instruments every night and they're phenomenal I was blown away on how how talented their their musicians are so this is them so going to go to the next one this is the the boys are singing a singing a special um that's the girls singing a special you know seen their the long dresses and things and a lot of these girls here actually came from man the Atlantic coast I think is where they're from and actually and they would tell me that they would have to they would have to write ride a boat for 10 hours and on a bus for 16 hours to get to that camp you know and I and here we are we got a camp what an hour from us we got a camp in Louisiana that's 7 hours uh Ohio is 13 hours South Carolina is 16 hours you know and here they had to ride a boat 10 hours and a bus for 16 hours and that really done something for my heart knowing they did everything it took to get there so this is Wednesday night and so we we we plow for four Services Monday Tuesday brother Solomon and I and we were hit in the stone wall and and I shut myself in my room and was saying Lord we need a breakthrough you know I I I don't know what to do I'm doing what I what I know to do I'm preaching the message strong I trying to break the atmosphere you know and then the Lord would start to deal me on the atmosphere what I was what I've been preaching and uh and I was talking to brother Paco and I said brother Paco we need a breakthrough I I I don't know what we're going to to do these kids are here I'm trying everything I know to do and I'm reading on atmosphere on my iPad while while we're there in the office and I come across this quote brother brandham said and there's no no one person can do it by themselves it takes us all together to pull together to pray together to stand together in unity in the spirit and pray for this Brethren have been telling me that the churches has been PR and had prayer meetings prior to this meeting and I'm so thankful for that when you gather together and pray like that it changes the whole atmosphere and so I I mentioned brother Paco I said well they feel comfortable with just laying hands on each other at the beginning of before I preach and just and I read this quote and we pray but apocal says yeah let let's try it and I'm telling you I read this quote and there was an atmosphere that just came in a special way we laid hands on one another and as we prayed that atmosphere broke and this is at the end of the service there was no move like it it it was a stone wall but after that service and preaching on atmosphere the altars was full the brother there in the white right next to the girl in the dress as I'm praying I'm going down the line he just grabs me and just balling his eyes out wouldn't let me go and I said I was sitting there crying with him knowing that if the atmosphere can just change you all it takes is the atmosphere to change and breakthroughs can to happen you know so that that was the highlight for me of the meeting right after that we were soaring it was it was WI open after that service go to the next one so this is that next morning actually I'm telling the testimony of brother Joe and sister Stephanie right here the power of the message I told him that the testimony of Caleb and again the anointing of God would just come through there and the kids were glued some crying and and and some of them was coming up to brother Paco and says I I didn't want to come to the camp I had no desire but I came here to see the authority of this message you know and here I am telling the testimony of what this message can do for drug addicts I was telling how Joe was a thief now he's a trustee you know Stephanie was an atheist now she's teaching our children about God you know and an anointing just would come through that building and kids realizing connecting the dots that he Jesus Christ is still alive today you know and so you can go to the next one we baptized to um this is a young lady we baptized baptized to the water was was cold uh you can go to the next one this is all of them gathering on the outside of the pool um there and the sun was bright we're on the wrong side of the pool I guess and I'm I can barely see you can my my hands over my eyes they're they're singing and things like that uh there's a few more of the kids around the pool there that's another one this one here I guess don't like water and man I I it it I never experienced anything like this before so I baptized the first one you know and I I go to baptize this the second one and she's fighting and she's fight I'm pushing and I and I just pull her back up and brother apocal says no she didn't go all the way under she says her forehead's still up I looked at him he says no he says do it again I'm like so I grab her and I and I and she's fighting again and I'm pushing and we finally got her under barely we barely got her under but that I I never experienced that before in my life you know so this is in the kitchen this is Sister Jessica brother Allan's wife on the right here and man they worked hard the food was amazing uh you can go to the next one um some more of the ladies there the kitchen was hot no AC this is on them on the outside late at night washing dishes and things it sort of reminded me of our camp and how much work we had to do at camp Crossway so this is their food so the on the very top is called a plene and it's like our potato they cook it every different direction telling you that that that there was really mushy if you you can go to the next one uh uh this here is the this here is a common breakfast meal which is this rice beans eggs and toast um that's a planteen as well so you can fry it and it's it's shaped like a banana so that's another another way you can eat a plene that's fish I never eat anything like that before where the eyeballs were staring at me so I was watching them do it and telling you what I I I just sucked it up ate it and it was delicious they were eating the heads the brains and I I didn't do that but that's more plene that's another plantin that's like a spud they got meat in the middle so it's it's pretty neat seeing oh what what they can do this here is the the fellowship hall there of the cafeteria and so the theme of the camp was fear no more and so I thought that pretty neat that's what that means up there fear no more so this is uh brother Paco on the left myself brother Allan brother Solomon this is at the end of the camp we we had our last service on Friday night so this is Brother uh y'all may know him uh brother uh this is Brother David Nash from Washington I had never met him before never heard of him before but everybody up there were asking do you know a David Nash a David Nash and no I never have everybody was asking about brother James Miller you know it it's pretty neat I got to talk to him on Thursday you know letting him know that everybody's still asking about brother Miller and things you know but this is a missionary he's from Washington that he goes in the jungles and he he stays up there for months and so it was nice being able being able to Mee him so the girls on the right is uh uh some they got a her father has passed away but he was a pastor in Manawa and has a well established business in in the city there so they took us out to eat and things uh man I had the biggest steak I've ever eaten in my life you know so they there it is they treated that's very very well uh uh very giving people you know so you can go to the next one that's outside the restaurant like the rest the the the waiters have bow ties on and vests you know they they they really treated us very well when to this restaurant this is on the in the airport in Manawa we're about to fly out on Saturday morning um I don't know if y'all recognize this guy or not this is Brother Jimmy from Camp Crossway what are the odds we're on the same plane plane flying into Manawa and on the same plane flying out sitting at the same terminal you know so well we got to get a picture shank so I can show Dad you know so this is all the camp all the kids brother Allen on the right I sort of blend in and so I but Solomon if you we can't zoom up but man me and Solomon laughed and laughed CU he was trying to find me and couldn't find me because I blend in with him but Solomon just sticks out the big old white face you know but it it was pretty funny we was laughing teasing each other I I blend in and he he stands out but anyways I think I think that's all here's you got the sound for that and their worship is just just wonderful [Music] [Music] [Music] and if you can hear the the musicians phenomenal musicians they're all teenagers you know and all just hearing them them worship that's all kids all the adults sit all the way in the back so that is that's all the kids I think there was a total of 120 130 that was there and so man I I loved it once again I appreciate y'all's prayer and support I've got invites man all there was so many pastors that we're saying this is what we need we need preaching like this you know and so it really encouraged me just preached the message brother Paco came up and saying brother Josh we need young men that is preaching preaching like this you know so it was a good experience for me just preach the message and and let God let God do the rest I hope you enjoyed that um I had a good time Lord will and I'll be going back sometime I I don't know they they've asked us to come back next year for that for that camp so we'll we'll see how it how it uh plans out but anyways if if you would have your Bibles tonight Ephesians 1 and3 I won't hold you long tonight but Ephesians 1 and3 blessed be the god of father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus let's bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father One More Time Lord as we come into your house Lord I Thank you for blessing

everybody in One Accord in one place then suddenly there came from Heaven a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind there you are he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and so uh on Wednesday was talking about how we're we've been seated into Heavenly places and brother Brandon is telling us this is what is in Heavenly places this these are the blessings that the God is giving us when we can get into this other atmosphere and I don't believe that that they're empty promises or or or or something that the message has said we can have but we can never obtain but I believe whatever this message has told us we can have and what the word told us we can have I believe we can achieve it we're we're not uh the blind leading the blind but we got a direction that we are following and brother Brandon would say now we know that it's nice to have churches that's wonderful we know it's nice to have denominations they're wonderful it's nice to have seminaries it's wonderful but Christ never told us to build any seminaries or anything like that he said preach the gospel and the gospel isn't word only but through the power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit which would produce the signs of Mark 16 when he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them the word itself is dead until it becomes into an action and produces the life so the gospel is not word only but it's the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost and so all of these these these these promises that are in Heavenly places would stay there until we get into the right atmosphere until we're we're conditioned for the word to come in fulfillment and brother Brandon would say except the corn of wheat Fallen to the ground it abides alone then when the word is brought into a heart of faith that makes every promise in the Bible live again see it's got to live it must live if it's received in the right place under the right condition every seed will live again if it's put under the right condition so that's why we have to get into the right atmosphere that's the reason we have to condition ourself or our ground brother brandom is putting it that you're the field you know the word is the seed that's going to fall into your field but unless your condition the word is never going to be brought to life it's it's going to lay dormant there and the Bible would would tell us the parable of the sewer and even though that the that the the the the the the the man sewing the seed was a good man the the seed was good seed it wasn't something that was rotten but the reason why it would not bring forth was the condition of the ground you know and the Bible would tell us that some seed fell by the wayside some fell by on Stony ground and and and I like one part of it it says that that the seed fell into into some soil and as it would start to come up there was no moisture to water the seed and brother Brandon would tell us that is representation of the Holy Ghost you know the the the the the word can fall but unless there's the moisture of the Holy Ghost it's going to dry up and die and one of them brother Jesus would say that as the as the the fruit started to come up they be they became offended at the gospel he says they started to go through some things and then they got offended at the gospel then their fruit dried up and died and sometimes we can get to that place that we get offended at God get offended you know we feel like he's forsaken us that he's left us we go through hard times go through some Circ cumstances and as we become offended our ground is not conditioned the way it's supposed to be that's when we lose our joy lose our peace lose our happiness but if we can just get back to the right condition that same word can fall into it and the seed must live if it's received in the right Condition it's got to live and brother Brandon would talk about the law of electricity he would say that Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity with a a kite and a key right in in a bottle I think and brother brandom says whenever lightning hit that he was running around saying I got it I got it I got it brother brandom says he didn't know what he had but he knew that he got it then Thomas Edison would come along and would not just know that something is here but he would realize the law of it and as Thomas Edison would would discover the light bulb he wasn't just saying I've got some power but I can grab that power and put it into action and I don't believe we're just running around and saying we got a message we got a message we got a message but we know the life of the message there there's a life that is on the inside of the bride and you see Thomas Edison could just find the law of it to produce it and there's the law of the word and brother Brandon is telling us your your your your your heart has to be conditioned the right way and brother Brandon talking about electricity he says when if you go into the dark mountains and and you're stumbling around in darkness and maybe you you step on a snake or fall into a hole he says it would do you no good to say electricity where are you electricity light it up you know he says it does no good until you follow the laws of electricity you see so whenever you when you're in the darkness you got to find the law of it first and sometimes before we cry out to God we got to go through hard times but we got to go back to the law of it getting into the right atmosphere even when we're struggling and and having mind battles if we can just get into the right atmosphere that same word that spoke in the beginning can fall over our lives and brother Brandon would tell this here and I said to a friend it's the atmosphere that's what it is if you want to have a great healing service here tonight let's have a great atmosphere of belief believing you're going to be healed see no matter how real Jesus would be here at the platform or out or out there he could not heal you unless unless the atmosphere is right for your healing ain't that powerful he says if you're wanting healing and even if the Corporal body of Jesus was upon this platform he could not heal you until you came into the right atmosphere and oh myel brother Brandon would tell us we Christ is here in every aspect but the Corporal body because many times we we I I know I've thought of it if I could just stand before Jesus or or stand before the prophet he he he can look over my heart and and give me a a vision or or bring a healing or or a peace of mind and here brother brandom is saying even if Jesus was here he couldn't do nothing for you until you get into the right atmosphere so we don't need the Corporal Body of Christ here all we need is an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that his word can fall into and produce the results oh Hallelujah brother Brandon he would say in one place that that the 120 they were in one cord one place gathered together under the atmosphere of expecting God to move and do signs and wonders and he says let's move ourselves up into that bracket step up into faith and move out of these three dimensions into the next one so brother Bram is's putting it that the 120 when they were in the upper room that atmosphere was created by their expectation and then they would step out of this Earthly Dimension into a heavenly atmosphere and he says so can we he says let us move oursel out of this bracket by faith and step out of this Dimension into that other dimension brother Brandon would talk about the 120 in the upper room and would say that that that that they were praising God and blessing God for the Holy Ghost even when the Holy Ghost wasn't there yet they were blessing God for the promise of the Holy Ghost and he says while they were there blessing God for it he says that atmosphere was created then the promise of the Holy Ghost fell upon them so even when they did not see a change yet see a difference yet or or feel any emotion yet or or a sensation yet they were still praising God knowing that my praise can create an atmosphere that the promised word can be fulfilled in that's why we praise God even when we're low even when we're tired even when we don't see anything different in our circumstances Our Praise can create an act atmosphere that changes circumstances oh come on now your praise in the middle of your hard time just like Paul and Silas as they were chained up in the prison cell their praise changed that atmosphere that would bring the walls crumbling down and your praise even in the hard time can change the atmosphere around you and the conditions that the promised word can be fulfilled that's what we need today is some more worshippers that knows what it's like that lay their troubles aside to lay their heart fillings aside and the bitterness aside and say God I'm coming under an expectation to see God move and as we lift up holy hands God inhabits the Praises of the people oh Hallelujah you see and and and I know I mentioned this on Wednesday but brother brandom talks about the acorn and and I heard this today and man I I just loved that he says if I give you an acorn or or if I said I'm going to give you an acorn tree and the just just give you an acorn he says everything that is in that tree is in the acorn and I left brother Brandon would put it he would say all right brother Brandon I'm going to try and see if this will work and grow down here in my backyard and and you would say I'm going to put it in the right kind of soil just like you got up North I'm going to see if it'll grow here and I love that because we got churches all all over America all over the world and many times we look at other churches and think my goodness why can't we be in Revival like them why can't we see the supernatural like that church or or see the see healings and miracles and deliverances like that church for the brandom says that Acorn seed can be put in the north just like the South and it'll produce the same results so it ain't the church that has a magic power it's the soil it's you that can create the atmosphere that brings forth healings and deliverances and revivals and refilling of the Holy goost you see I I I don't believe that the power of God is just for the book of Acts or or just for a special people or or a few ministers but I believe that everybody that can condition them themselves in the right channel can see a Revival like never before in every one of our lives and you see brother Brandon would talk about would talk about the the the the grain of wheat that was in Egypt and I think this was back in the ' 50s they found a grain of wheat that was in the Gardeners of Joseph right whenever whenever the famine and he created all those buildings and things and he put wheat inside of it but the brandom says they they got that little grain of wheat and put it here in America I believe in the right kind of soil then it would produce the same results as it did back then even though it was what 2500 years later 3,000 years later it was the life of that seed in the right soil and oh my we're not living in the day of the book of Acts of John and and the Apostle Paul but we got the same seed we're not in Jerusalem we're not in Bethlehem but right here in Pony oleah home and the same power that fell in that Upper Room can still fall at New Life Outreach like never before we can still see the power of God like never before and and right after this brother Brandon will talk about a painted fire and he says wouldn't it be crazy if you was freezing and I brought you inside and and put you by a painted fire and says here let this warm you up a little bit brother brandom says that pain and fire is talking of something of yesterday and he says that pain and fire cannot warm you today oh my it's speaking of something in the day gone by and oh my I don't believe we're preaching a gospel of a day gone by a gospel of yesterday cannot heal you today a gospel of yesterday cannot save your children today but a god of today a Bible of today a message of today can warm every one of our Lives oh Hallelujah brother brandom says could you imagine people freezing to death and and I would paint them a a picture of a fire and say look at the fire burning isn't it warm look up the people standing around warming but that's only a picture of something that has been you'll just freeze the same looking at the picture what it takes is that fire to be reproduced again for your warmth oh my for that fire to be reproduced again in for your warmth and I believe that's what we need our new life Outreach I believe all of us can can can say that together with me is I want to see the fire of God like it did at the old building I want to see the fire of God like it did for the book of Acts I want to see the fire of God like it did for brother Brandon but what we need is to rekindle the Flames of today you see brother Brandon would tell us that there's a difference between glowing and shining right he says Hollywood shines but the gospel glows he says the shine shine is something on the outside but he says glowing is from the inside that comes to the outside and that's what we need is not paintting fires that can shine uh good religion shine nice dresses and and shine nice suits but what we need is the fire of the Holy Ghost to burn on the inside and that'll start to glow on the outside that this ain't just some religion of yesterday but it is a reality of today hallelujah we're not to shine the gospel we're to Glow the gospel we have become the Revival oh Hallelujah you see I believe a gospel can still put a praise on people's lips even when we don't feel like it we can get in that right condition get into that right atmosphere what it is is we've come into a place where the word of God can come and and bring forth the life and brother Brandon or the Bible Will Tell Us in the Old Testament that only the high priests could go into the holiest of holies right and before they could go into the holiest of holies they first had to be conditioned right they had to may have the right garments on they they had to to do a certain way and they had to have a bail upon the bottom of their the bottom of their uh their dress there and they were to dance holy holy you know you so before they could go into the holiest of holies they first had to be conditioned oh my many times we we want to get into the presence of God but we're not willing to condition oursel we're not willing to throw things out we're not willing to lay things aside and you see brother brandom said the high priest had to be holy dedicated and anointed and I don't believe God has changed his mind if he required the high priest to be holy and dedicated and anointed to get into that presence God still requires that today right he still requires a way of Holiness the Bible would say a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness and brother brandom he would take this the scripture many times and would say it's not a Highway of Holiness it's a way of Holiness and he says that way is in the middle of the highway he says not on the sides cuz that's where all the trash is Oh my he says the way is in the middle of that highway so the water can push all the trash off and there's no puddles in the middle of that and many times we get to the left or to the right and we start to accumulate things but all you have to do is get back on the way of Holiness and let the refilling of the Holy Ghost push those things that you started to accumulate oh Hallelujah you see if it's built right brother brandom says you don't have puddles standing in your road all the time if it's built right so if you're built right in the middle of the road there's no trash there's no puddles that are starting to accumulate in our lives and you see but the brownon would talk about the Baptist and would say the Baptists are fundamentally right but they know nothing about the Supernatural and and I thought my goodness we can be right fundamentally you know we can have all the dos and don'ts down and brother brandom says if they don't know and I'll just read it to you and he says but they know nothing about the supernatural my brethren that's where you're losing the blessing oh my is whenever you get away from the supernatural you start to lose our spiritual blessings we can still be blessed you know maybe have a a nice car or a nice house and lots of money in the bank account you know but that's not the blessings that God promised us he promised us spiritual blessings that's what I want in my life that's what I want in this church it's not just blessings I want spiritual blessings I want a joy that can come on the inside even when I'm sad I want blessings in in my children's lives when they go through peer pressure the spiritual blessings are still there because I've conditioned them by my atmosphere Hallelujah that the supernatural can bring forth the blessings oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say and so I believe tonight that the holy spirit is here it's here for those who were destined to receive it who believe that believes it who is who is waiting on it I'm here it's here to straighten out every one of their spiritual problems it's here to heal every sick person that is present it's here but you've got to come and get in the atmosphere of it and the attitude to receive it ain't that powerful he says the Holy Ghost is here to straighten out all of your spiritual problems you see we don't need some psychologist right we don't need some some some 10-step program to get our life right and and teach us how to live all we need to do is get into the atmosphere of it and let the Holy Ghost fix all of our spiritual problems I believe he can still fix marital problems he can still save and and deliver rebellious teenagers that are bound by addictions I believe that it can take a a man that is on the on the verge of a mental breakdown and bring him back and bringing encouragement I believe God can still do it but it's getting into the atmosphere of it I still believe that our children can be on fire with the things of God they they can dance in the spirit and and speak in tongues if God permits them to do it I believe those things ain't behind us but the bride's Revival is still in action today if we as a congregation is willing to persevere for it if we're willing to fight for it and say God I'm tired of a dead religion I want to live in God up today I'm tired of just hearing testimonies of what God used to do I want to see God heal today I want to see God fill today I want to see a Revival today not a painted fire but a Revival of today oh and if you wanted tonight little church the blessings of God is waiting for for you to be conditioned the right way oh Hallelujah to get on the way of Holiness oh Hallelujah that's what we need Ephesians 4:23 which saying be renewed in the spirit of your mind that you put on the new man which is after God in righteousness and true Holiness so true Holiness is more than on the outside true Holiness is on the inside and then the Apostle Paul would tell us what true Holiness is in the next verse wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members of one another be you angry and sin not let the sun go down uh let let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that steal steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he might have he may have G to give to them that needeth and griev not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let all bitterness wrath anger claim or evil speaking but be pulled away from you with all malice that's what true Holiness is true Holiness Ain ain't a guy with a you know short hair and tattoos that don't have tattoos all over him or or a young lady with the long hair and a nice dress that ain't true Holiness that's Holiness but true Holiness is deeper on the inside the glowing of the Holy Ghost where there's no more bitterness there's no more anger there's no more wrath even when we fight these things we're not giving the devil any room oh come on now too many times we back up the spirits we back up the to mood swings we back up to these things instead of giving no place for the devil brother the Brandon would tell us the way of God is Holiness let this be known to every member here of the body of Christ until you live a whole life God refuses your sacrifice the sacrifice must be offered by holy hands so the way of God is Holiness and it is a holy life which is something on the inside you know brother the brown and would talk about about the children of Israel and would say they could not go into the promised land because they was not conditioned for it ain't that crazy he says they were not conditioned for it and so God would no longer deal with them God would no longer would no longer come to them he would not take them to the promised land until they realized they they were dead in their theories then God took them over so they had to realize what they had their painted fire was not conditioning them to go on the other side and then once they realize that brother Bram says then God can take them over you see I don't believe God has promised us spiritual blessings and will not take us over but we got to realize that the painted fire is no longer good enough I need something of today then God will take us over into all spiritual blessings and the glory of God can fall like never before you see there was not they were no longer there wasn't conditioned and he see they had to go over Jordan and brother brand he would tell us that he says before he says Jordan means death you got to die out to yourself before you can cross over that's right go over there people live in a lukewarm condition the Bible said so and so before you can go over you got to Cross Jordan which means dying to yourself and how do you die to yourself the Bible will talk about Elisha and Elijah and I won't hold you much much longer tonight but the Bible would talk about Elisha and Elijah and brother Brandon would tell us there's three stages to Elisha following Elijah right he says he followed him the gilgal then the school of the prophets then the Jordan and what I love about the story of it is the Bible would tell us that that the Lord spoke to Elijah and would say go to Elisha and anoints him to be a prophet you know and the Bible says that Elijah just walked by Elisha and threw his mantle upon him and Elisha turned around and says you wait for me let me go kiss my mother and father by and then I will follow you and the Bible says that he was he was plowing with oxen y y'all remember the story he was plowing with oxen and the Bible says when he greeted his mother and father by he went to The Oxen slew the auction and he gave it to all the people to eat brother brandom says that meant that all of the world was dead behind him so now he got one thing nothing behind him he had one one way to go that was in front of him and then the B brother Brandon would say that that was a type of Christ and the church were forsaken all that follow after him and so then the Bible I and I think it I think it's pretty neat that the Bible would tell us that Elijah would test Elisha he would say just stay here and Eli Elisha would say no as long as the Lord liveth I'm going to follow you so he would go with him to gilgal and then that he would say Elijah would say the Lord is calling me to the school of the prophets but you just stay here no as long as the Lord liveth I will follow you you see as long as there is a God alive still we should put every part of our being behind this word I've come too far to turn around I've come too far to be P to try to get warmed by a painted fire I've come too far let me see the realities of this gospel oh Hallelujah then the Bible says they went to the school of the prophets right and what is so incredible so now it's no longer the prophet testing them now there was the 50 I believe it was 50 uh 50 prophets at this school that would tell Elisha Elijah's about to leave and he's going to Jordan but he's going to die he's old and he and they were saying won't you just stay here just stay here with us and then he would say the same thing no as long as as as my soul liveth as long as there is a God I'm going to follow Elijah and the Bible says that the 50 of them were watching Elijah and Elisha at the Jordan River and that really spoke to my heart that we can do that many times too we can stop at sanctification and we're looking over there and we can see a brother following the prophet crossing the Jordan stepping into his inheritance and we're sitting over here saying come on back come on back but as long as the Lord liveth you've got a right to go over Jordan cross over and everything behind you is dead Elijah Elisha says no wayy I'll just read it to the Bible says in 2 Kings 2:6 Elijah said unto him now this was right after the the the the prophets were talking to him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I would not leave thee and the two went on and 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a far off and they then the two stood by Jordan so here is Elisha following the prophet and all of the other ones are watching from afar oh my word not to just watch the brid's Revival we're to get into the bride's Revival we're not just to watch from afar the God is still a god of Miracles but we're to get into the Miracles and see I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I'm not just watching from afar but let me be a part of it let me be a part of it and what I love about it is what would happen next after the third stage then Elijah is about to be taken away and Elijah looks at him and Elisha says what do you want you've been following me what do you want and Elisha says I want a double portion I want a double portion of what you got and what would Elijah say you've asked a hard thing oh my you've asked a hard thing but when I leave if you keep your eyes on me if you watch me when I leave you shall have it and brother brandham says Elisha never took his eyes off of Elijah he knew it was a hard thing but if he kept his eyes upon the upon the word and brother brandom says that was a type of the word he says we are to keep our eyes upon the word brother brandom would saying one place the problem of it is is we got too many too many Christians that are spiritual crosseyed he says one ey is on the world one eye is upon the word he says you can never do it that way you got to keep your eyes upon the word so as long as the Lord liveth I'm keeping my focus upon this message I don't care the family troubles I don't I'm not looking at the troubles in the church I'm not looking at at what this one's doing what that one's doing I want my double portion and as long as I can keep my eyes upon Jehovah Gyra I can receive my reward I can receive my blessing oh and what I love about the story is brother Brandon he would say that the reason we don't see things today is because we're not looking for him we're looking at our churches our denominations or our great structures how are how are we growing get your eyes off of that and look at the Messiah so quit looking at the church quit looking at this and that look at the Messiah and here the Bible would tell us that that that whenever Elijah was being called away his mantle would fall back on Elisha right I don't know it's a simple story but what I love about it was what is so significant about this mantle because we know what would happen Elijah he would grab that mantle and would hit the Jordan and the Jordan River would would would would would roll back and they would walk upon dry ground it was that very same mantel that that Elijah would throw upon Elisha and he didn't even say a word and Elisha would say I'm following you so what was so important about this mantle that that mantle would be the double portion for Elisha and and I started to look into it the very first place that that the Bible records Elijah's mantel is whenever he is in the cave he's running from je uh from Jezebel he's running for his life and he's in that cave and the Lord would come and speak right he heard the Thunder and God wasn't in the Thunder he heard the he heard the Earth or seen the earthquake and God wasn't in the earthquake he seen the he seen the fire and God wasn't in the fire but he heard a still Small Voice and God was in that voice and right after that the Bible would say in First Kings 19 and13 and it was so when Elijah heard it then he wrapped his face in his mantle and so what what got this power in this mantle was that still Small Voice and I love it cuz you look you look up the definition in the Hebrew the definition of Elijah's Mantle means Glory Splendor and magnificance you look at everybody else's everybody else's uh mantle it means cloak so what what made his mantle so different he was in the presence of that still small voice and it was that Glory that was upon Elijah that he would pass down to Elisha and he would pick up that same Glory that was upon the prophet and would say where is the god of Elijah and the god of the old was in the god of the new the God for Elijah was now the God for Elisha oh my and we're not serving a God that only worked through William brandom we're serving a god that is inside the living bride upon the Earth today we've got our double portion the glory of the Lord is rising upon us and is sheding upon the people what is this Glory it's the authority of the Holy Ghost coming inside of a people on the Earth and they're seeing the fruits of the word in their life not a pain and fire but a god of today where is the god of Elijah he wasn't afraid to put it into action where is the god of Elijah I've got his glory have got his mantle and if I got that mantle God has to do the same things for me today we need to get some ambition about ourselves where is the god of Elijah where is the god of brother Brandon where is the god of the book of Acts where is the God for all of these Elders if he is your God we can see that same Supernatural and New Life Outreach come on now if he's your God our expectation is I'm going to see a Revival like never before for and I'm going to get into that atmosphere oh come on cuz if you really if you don't believe that he's your God you're not going to ask anything for it right the Bible would say you have not because you ask not come on now the Bible would say uh uh ask abundantly that your joy may be full you see you're not going to ask if you don't think he's your God but if you know he's your God ask for big things brother brand going say that ask ask for big things maybe it seems like it's a hard thing to see your children on fire with the Holy Ghost but ask for it keep your eyes upon the word you see the brother Brandon he he would talk about Elisha and would say the reason that God called Elisha was because he would plow with oxen and he knew that that he knew how to appreciate straight roads and he knew if he looked back he says he would wiggle off of the road Oh my he knew that he how to keep his eyes not on what Elijah can do but what can I do you see we're not looking for a prophet to come upon the Earth and ride the trail again you know we are riding that trail we are the manifestation of the word in this hour the Bible would say forgetting those things which are behind you and we press towards the Mark we're not turning around and saying man I wish I was with brother brandom but the same Angel of the Lord that was with brother brandom is here today oh Elijah or Elisha he was used to plowing he knew if he looked behind he was going to end up over here or over there but he had to keep his eyes straight on the prize we're not looking behind us at a pain and fire we're looking today at the realities of the spirit of God oh come on now I'm not looking at a youth camp of 10 years ago or or when I got the Holy Ghost whenever I was 14 there there in Gaya Virginia I'm thankful for that but what can God do for me today come on now brother Brandon would say that whenever the the the prophets try to get Elisha to stay there but the brandom says he had experienced that power and he knew there was more for him so if he knew there was more for him he was not going to settle for anything less and if you know there was more for you don't settle for anything less but keep on persevering oh Hallelujah I'm not settling for anything less I am persevering we've tasted of the good things of God and we know what we've tasted up we can continue to eat on oh Hallelujah that's why we know that this message is the truth we've experienced that power we've experienced it and and I know I've read this this scripture before but but I just love it Isaiah 52 and one awake awake and put on thy strength o Zion put on thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem oh holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean Shake thyself from the dust and arise Shake thyself from the dust Shake thyself from your humanity and put on his glory put on his strength the Bible would say let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of the light but the Brandon would say we've been invited to share his glory we've been invited you as I was saying on Wednesday that Jesus lived in a world that the disciples knew nothing about the disciples had had they were confused whenever Jesus would talk but you've been invited into this place that the disciples knew nothing about you've been invited to step into his glory and see the manifestation of the word of God brother Brandon would say we've been claimed by his glory in one place he would say we've been brought out of the devil's pwn sh and claimed by the glory of Jesus Christ he would say in one place that the that the weakest hands the feeblest of hands have to testify of the glory of God you see that's what happens when we are claimed when we're conditioned for the in the right atmosphere even the weak have to say I am strong even the poor have to say I am rich even the ones that is discouraged have to say I am encouraged we've been claimed by the glory of God you see the devil want had a claim on every one of our lives but Christ would break that claim and then seal us to the day of our Redemption that the devil had no more claims Upon Our Lives Hallelujah the voice of the groom is now in the bride what is it whatever Elisha and brother Brandon would say it was a double portion he said Elijah done eight Miracles Elisha done 16 Miracles it was a double portion and and brother Brandon then would say that we're a continuation of the ministry of Christ he said says the church will be honed in such a condition you see we got to be conditioned for this we will be honed in such a condition till the church's ministry will be so close and be just exactly the kind of ministry that Jesus had you speak under this mountain and doubt not and it will happen as you say it oh hallelujah we're doing the Greater Works brother Brandon would say because it has to be because a woman and her husband has become one they become one and so does the bride and Christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same you shall prophesy again remember John you're a type of John the angel would tell John go to that Mighty angel with an open book in hand and say give me that book you eat the book it shall be sweet in your mouth bitter in your tummy but then you're going to prophesy again what was it the voice of the groom was now in the bride what the groom said the bride is saying oh my that's what brother Brandon would say let no negative confession come out of your mouth cuz now that that ain't lining up with scripture whatever is lining up with scripture you say it negativity ain't lining up with scripture
