[40:29] nothing Lord and it just takes you to
[40:33] come Among Us and work a supernatural
[40:35] work and may you feel welcome here
[40:38] tonight is our prayer and help me just
[40:40] to get myself out of the way we ask
[40:43] these things in your lovely name Jesus
[40:45] Christ and the church says am amen and
[40:49] amen 1 Thessalonians the 5th chapter and
[40:53] the 17th verse is just very short but it
[40:56] says pray without ceasing can you say
[41:00] that with me pray without ceasing then
[41:04] if you'll turn to First Timothy just a
[41:07] book
[41:08] over uh 1 Timothy Chapter 2 and verse
[41:16] 8 and it says I will therefore that men
[41:20] pray everywhere lifting up holy hands
[41:24] without wrath and outing amen you can uh
[41:29] have your seats this evening and um I
[41:34] guess the the title that I would uh use
[41:36] tonight is is um why we should
[41:40] pray and um it's a uh subject that is
[41:45] quite broad but uh so we won't be able
[41:48] to cover it all this evening but I pray
[41:52] that something will be said to
[41:54] stir uh stare us us up uh to more
[41:58] prayer you know sometimes uh we as the
[42:02] people of God act as though we're
[42:05] helpless when when
[42:07] we have situations that come our way and
[42:11] are backs against the wall and and um we
[42:15] wonder what we're going to do and you
[42:17] know how it's going to work out and yada
[42:20] yada and uh so much nervousness that is
[42:23] going on in the land today but I I don't
[42:27] believe that God has called us out of
[42:31] the world I don't believe that he's
[42:33] called us out of Babylon and uh only for
[42:37] him to remain hidden and unseen to us I
[42:43] believe that if he called you out of
[42:44] unbelief and out of the muck and the M
[42:47] of sin and and these things then he's
[42:51] done it for a purpose as the prophet
[42:53] said and that is to show him himself
[42:57] through you and to you uh and his power
[43:02] ain't that right so since the beginning
[43:04] of time man has has offered prayer unto
[43:09] God and uh you know as it's been said
[43:12] you know that prayer is is certainly
[43:15] important uh to to every believer
[43:19] there's there's not one um of us that we
[43:23] could say well you know I'm we we just
[43:25] don't need prayer every believer uh
[43:29] prayer is important and Satan uh knows
[43:33] the importance of prayer he's not dumb
[43:36] uh he he certainly knows the importance
[43:39] and this is why he he attacks us or
[43:42] fights us uh so hard in our prayer life
[43:47] and because that prayer is important you
[43:50] know to to Mankind we have places that
[43:54] we have design ated uh uh for prayer
[43:58] such as the the house of God this this
[44:02] building uh uh is designated for prayer
[44:05] for Jesus said my house shall be called
[44:09] The House of Prayer not just not the
[44:12] house of worship or not just uh House of
[44:15] just anything but it it it is des
[44:18] designated as the House of Prayer but
[44:21] not only that our home should be a
[44:23] constant place of Prayer
[44:26] amen it it it it should always be a
[44:29] place um uh that we would pray unto God
[44:33] but but not only just the home but
[44:36] anywhere everywhere um uh we believe
[44:39] that God will hear our prayer and uh uh
[44:44] and and we're thankful for that whether
[44:46] you're out in the woods whether you're
[44:47] in your car whether whether uh you know
[44:50] you're in the grocery store whatever God
[44:53] hears prayer do you believe that amen
[44:56] it's not just a designated place but you
[44:59] know Jesus though encourages us to get
[45:02] alone and pray it's one thing to come
[45:05] together as like we are tonight and to
[45:07] pray and and to have or you know uh uh
[45:11] uh congregation comes and and has prayer
[45:14] meetings and things and brother brandom
[45:16] encouraged that of having prayer prayer
[45:19] meetings but here we find in Matthew 6
[45:22] and6 Jesus says when thou pray EST enter
[45:26] into thy closet and when thou H has shut
[45:30] thy door pray to thy father which is in
[45:34] secret and thy father which seeth in
[45:37] secret shall reward thee thee openly
[45:41] amen so then then if if Jesus is telling
[45:45] us that we must spend time alone in
[45:47] prayer you know we we find that the
[45:50] prophet got away uh in hunting uh he
[45:53] hunted a lot and but he says it's not
[45:55] it's not really like what people thought
[45:57] just to go out and get deer or fish or
[46:00] whatever but it was to spend time with
[46:02] God Alone in prayer and I I think that's
[46:06] that's uh that's that that applies to
[46:09] every one of us is finding some time
[46:12] alone the Bible talks of how Jesus went
[46:15] to the mountain alone to pray amen and
[46:19] and you know brother Ram says that when
[46:22] we pray in secret he says there seems to
[46:26] be something to the prayer that takes
[46:28] all the hypocrisy out see he says we we
[46:32] seem to get in better connection with
[46:35] God When We Get Alone he says that when
[46:39] we're alone we we usually pray different
[46:42] than what we would if we pray it in
[46:45] church amen something about being alone
[46:48] with God that that it it brings a a
[46:51] greater
[46:52] sincerity because now you just you you
[46:56] you you're not and and you just excuse
[46:58] the expression but you're not trying to
[47:00] impress you're you're not uh you know
[47:02] you're not worried about whatever is
[47:04] around you but you can share with God
[47:07] the deepest um the deepest secrets of
[47:11] our hearts and there's sometimes you
[47:13] don't want people to know that you're
[47:15] how just uh helpless you feel or or how
[47:18] lonely you may feel or how desperate you
[47:21] are and afraid of what people will think
[47:24] or what they will say or what they'll do
[47:26] and and yada yada but you get alone with
[47:29] God and you begin to pray amen and
[47:33] brother Bram would tell us the greatest
[47:35] Revelation and inspiration comes when we
[47:39] are alone with God he says if we would
[47:42] take more time to get along with God we
[47:44] would live a better life a more
[47:47] Victorious Life in in Christ so so you
[47:51] you see the the life of a Christian is
[47:54] so different from the life of Just The
[47:56] Sinner or the average Church goer uh
[47:59] because they're they're they're they're
[48:01] so consumed with worldly things and busy
[48:05] life go go go and and trying to meet the
[48:08] demands of the world but but we're not
[48:11] called to meet the demands of the world
[48:13] we're not called to keep up with the
[48:15] Joneses per se we're not called to do
[48:18] these things but but more important we
[48:21] are called to walk with God Alone amen
[48:24] and sometimes s that we may share our
[48:27] our burdens with our spouse we may share
[48:30] with our closest friends and yet they
[48:33] are limited in helping they are limited
[48:36] in being able to relieve the burden but
[48:38] when you go to God In Prayer amen
[48:42] there's something that that happens
[48:45] because God is the one who can work the
[48:48] miraculous so brother brandham taught us
[48:50] that prayer is very essential he said I
[48:54] spend a great part of of my life in
[48:56] prayer amen and he says friends you may
[48:59] laugh too much you may talk too much you
[49:01] may you may walk too much but you will
[49:04] never you'll never pray too much ain't
[49:09] that right so in another place he said
[49:11] you Christians don't stay in that
[49:14] lukewarm condition anymore lay aside
[49:17] everything lay aside everything and just
[49:20] get as close to God as you can walk with
[49:23] him talk with him him can you say amen
[49:27] he says let everything else be secondary
[49:31] but your prayer life stay right with him
[49:36] all the time I hope this is okay just
[49:38] reading quotes here to you but he says
[49:41] every day you're bound to sin and you're
[49:44] bound to be backsliding constantly so it
[49:47] takes a constant everybody say constant
[49:51] it takes a constant prayer to God Amen
[49:55] you cannot go by yesterday's experience
[49:58] you can't you know if you you got saved
[50:00] 10 years ago a year ago a month ago
[50:02] whatever you cannot go just on off of
[50:06] that experience but you have to be
[50:09] constantly in prayer because we we are
[50:12] backsliding every day and that's what a
[50:14] prophet said can you say amen amen see
[50:17] you may not be smoking the cigarettes
[50:19] you may not be uh uh uh uh the thief or
[50:23] you may not be in in adult or whatever
[50:26] but you're constantly backsliding amen
[50:29] and it's a gradual thing and therefore
[50:32] we have to constantly be in prayer we
[50:35] have to constantly walk with God can you
[50:39] say Amen even Jesus who did not know any
[50:42] sin amen spent much in time in prayer so
[50:46] the prophet says so to stay in
[50:49] Fellowship now think of it to stay in
[50:53] fellowship with the spirit that was in
[50:56] him see Jesus spent much time in prayer
[51:01] so to stay in fellowship with the spirit
[51:05] that was in him amen we don't want to be
[51:08] people that claim to have the Holy Ghost
[51:10] and yet be strangers to the very God
[51:12] that lives within us amen amen the Holy
[51:16] Ghost is not a myth the Holy Ghost amen
[51:18] is a literal person it is the person of
[51:21] God living inside of you amen deity is
[51:24] not in heaven deity is in you but prayer
[51:28] takes it to where we're in constant
[51:31] fellowship with the god that lives
[51:33] within us can you say amen and if Jesus
[51:36] had to do that then what about us ain't
[51:38] that right so prayer is the way of
[51:41] Believers and and this is why you should
[51:44] never never be yolked up with
[51:47] unbelievers amen the Bible talks about
[51:50] King Jehoshaphat and and who was a
[51:53] righteous man but he had joined up with
[51:56] with Ahab who was a make believer and
[51:59] and a lukewarm and and and we of course
[52:02] we all know what a lukewarm believer is
[52:05] it's it's actually just an unbeliever in
[52:07] Disguise amen but but uh uh Ahab was uh
[52:12] he he convinced
[52:15] Jehoshaphat uh uh uh to do a certain
[52:18] thing without consulting the Lord first
[52:20] and and we found out that Jehoshaphat
[52:23] got himself into trouble because he did
[52:26] not he did not consult the Lord so the
[52:29] prophet said see now ordinarily
[52:32] Jehoshaphat would have prayed over the
[52:34] subject would have thought about it
[52:35] first and said God what must I do but
[52:38] being yolked up with unbelievers he took
[52:41] the unbelievers way ain't that right see
[52:45] and and so what is the unbelievers way
[52:47] doing things without consulting God
[52:50] first Jehoshaphat would have prayed
[52:52] about it but he yoked himself up with
[52:55] the unbeliever and took the way of the
[52:57] unbeliever you'll always wind up getting
[53:00] yourself in trouble if you don't pray
[53:03] can you say amen amen see and so
[53:06] therefore he said that's the way many
[53:09] Spirit-filled Christians after Revival
[53:11] Falls because they they they yoke
[53:15] themselves up amongst people that say
[53:18] well I go to church we're just as good
[53:20] as the rest of them and you lose your
[53:24] experience can you sayen church we don't
[53:27] want to lose our experience we must stay
[53:30] in Revival constantly brother brandham
[53:34] said never let the spirit of Revival die
[53:38] can you say Amen see and so this message
[53:41] gives us a remedy there's a formula for
[53:45] us to stay in Revival I don't believe
[53:48] that you have to stay in a mess's church
[53:50] and die amen and and your experience
[53:53] just wither amen your pastor could be
[53:56] preaching fine sermons amen but it will
[53:59] never affect you in a positive light
[54:03] except you have fellowship with God
[54:06] you've got to stay in Fellowship just as
[54:09] much as the pastor has to stay in
[54:11] fellowship and parents have to stay in
[54:13] Fellowship every one of us has to stay
[54:15] in fellowship with God through prayer
[54:18] can you say Amen so he says you lose
[54:21] your experience so stay right in the
[54:23] road no matter what the rest of them
[54:24] does you know where you belong you know
[54:28] who you belong to so stay right under
[54:32] the power of prayer all the time don't
[54:36] let them call you off to something else
[54:38] in amusements and so forth and saying oh
[54:41] there's no harm in this if there's a
[54:44] question don't do it stay away from it
[54:47] can you say Amen so he warns us to to
[54:51] stay under the power of prayer all the
[54:55] the time amen see I I thought of how
[54:58] that Jehoshaphat amen here they were in
[55:01] trouble and yet Jehosaphat remembered
[55:04] that there was a prophet in the land he
[55:07] remembered that there was a man as uh uh
[55:10] uh uh Elisha that that was close by and
[55:14] the prophet said he had heard that
[55:16] Elisha poured water on the hands of
[55:20] Elijah amen the real prophet of God and
[55:24] and and and and the prophet said see
[55:26] Jehoshaphat knew then that that if if
[55:29] Elisha poured water on the hands of of
[55:33] the Prophet Elijah then uh uh he had to
[55:37] have dealings uh with the real Prophet
[55:41] ain't that right well I thought of that
[55:43] because Elisha the prophet said is the
[55:45] type of the Church of the bride of
[55:47] Christ today ain't that right amen see
[55:50] and and so then then if if Jehosaphat
[55:54] knew that if elishah had to have some
[55:56] had something to do with Elijah then he
[55:59] must have the word of God he he's he he
[56:03] he wouldn't go to the school of prophets
[56:05] he wouldn't go to anyone else because
[56:08] this man Elisha had dealings with that
[56:11] Prophet Elijah amen see he had poured
[56:14] water on his hands you know the the
[56:17] Bible or or we the the I guess the
[56:20] proverb is is birds of a feather flock
[56:23] together right amen and and you your
[56:26] your your acquaintances identify who you
[56:29] are well there was something that
[56:32] identified Elisha Amen to Jehoshaphat
[56:36] and that was he was connected with the
[56:38] prophet of God can you say Amen now the
[56:41] prophet said this how can you expect
[56:43] anybody to believe you when you're
[56:45] running around and acting the way you do
[56:47] and then come in and call yourselves
[56:49] Christians no wonder they don't call for
[56:51] you to come and pray for them and so
[56:53] forth see amen but but see uh uh even
[56:56] though Elijah was gone there was a man
[57:01] that had followed that prophet's message
[57:04] amen and had received a double portion
[57:08] of his Spirit can you say amen and they
[57:11] went to him for the answer and I I'll
[57:14] just say it this way by us pouring water
[57:18] on this message identifies us amen that
[57:23] the word is truly with the bride of
[57:26] Jesus Christ can you sayen see we're
[57:29] we're Associated brother Bram said show
[57:32] me your company I'll tell you who you
[57:33] are ain't that right well you say well
[57:36] how are we pouring water well brother
[57:37] Braham said by our Praises we we pour
[57:40] water amen by our Praises ain't that
[57:43] right so he says just like this take
[57:46] God's word for it and start rejoicing
[57:48] something will happen that brings the
[57:50] word to Life As We water it with praises
[57:53] see what makes makes the seed grow water
[57:56] see what makes the word of God grow is
[57:59] the Praises of God and he said if you'll
[58:02] take any Divine promise of God made in
[58:06] his Bible put it in your heart water it
[58:09] every day with the Praises of God then
[58:12] it's going to come to pass because it's
[58:14] going to grow can you say amen amen so
[58:16] you're not sitting there complaining
[58:18] about the message you're not sitting
[58:20] there dissecting the message amen
[58:22] because then there's no power with that
[58:24] it doesn't show that you're acquainted
[58:26] with the message but you get a people
[58:28] that pours the water on the message by
[58:31] their praises and simply just believing
[58:34] God praising God Amen it identifies that
[58:39] they have the word of God they have the
[58:41] power of God and that's what identified
[58:45] Elisha Amen to Jehoshaphat he had poured
[58:48] water on the hands of Elijah he was
[58:51] acquainted with Elijah can you say amen
[58:54] amen yes sir and I I have to say it this
[58:56] way even though our Prophet has gone the
[58:59] power of God is not left there are some
[59:02] people that are acquainted with the
[59:04] prophet of this hour I may have not been
[59:06] able to walk and see him in a personal
[59:10] uh way but I believe the message of the
[59:12] hour can you say amen and the word is in
[59:15] the bride of Christ today so we water
[59:19] the word the message with our praises
[59:21] and it's proof that we are associated
[59:24] with it amen see amen you love the Lord
[59:28] amen see so the prophet said see the
[59:31] sick and the sin and sinful world today
[59:34] is looking to a real Church of the
[59:36] Living God who possesses a double
[59:40] portion of his spirit amen they possess
[59:43] they're looking for someone that is
[59:45] possessed with uh uh possesses the uh
[59:48] double portion of his Spirit ain't that
[59:51] right so prayer is how we St stay
[59:54] connected with God just getting back to
[59:57] my subject here amen so we want to stay
[1:00:00] under the power of prayer and not let
[1:00:04] anyone anything distract us I don't care
[1:00:08] how what your situation is I don't care
[1:00:11] how bad it would seem I don't care all
[1:00:13] of these things don't you let nothing
[1:00:15] pull you away amen out of the power of
[1:00:19] prayer amen well why should Believers
[1:00:22] pray well as we said it it's it's it's a
[1:00:25] common uh uh uh statement there's power
[1:00:28] in prayer how many believes that amen
[1:00:31] there's power in prayer brother BR said
[1:00:33] see Prayer Changes Things prayer changes
[1:00:36] death to life prayer changes sickness to
[1:00:39] health changes Sinners to Saints it's
[1:00:42] prayer now see I cannot change it as a
[1:00:45] man you cannot change it as a as a human
[1:00:48] being can you say Amen but prayer is
[1:00:52] what changes things amen you and talk
[1:00:54] till you blew in the face amen and it
[1:00:57] still doesn't seem to uh uh uh uh solve
[1:01:00] the situation but prayer will change
[1:01:03] every situation do you believe that see
[1:01:07] prayer is the greatest weapon known to
[1:01:10] man amen there are times you know when
[1:01:13] when it's easy to get down and and uh uh
[1:01:16] uh pray and then there's times that it's
[1:01:18] not so easy to get down and pray and and
[1:01:21] and and you know we we find ourselves
[1:01:24] coming up with all kinds of excuses as
[1:01:26] well we we overslept we got to get going
[1:01:29] we got to get the day going and and and
[1:01:31] to be honest I'm I'm I'm I'm there as
[1:01:34] well I'm guilty uh uh but we allow
[1:01:37] things and all of a sudden everything
[1:01:39] starts controlling us us can you say
[1:01:42] amen and and and and yet the world is
[1:01:46] not to control us situations are not to
[1:01:49] control us we are to control every
[1:01:51] situation you believe that now we're
[1:01:54] we're Sons and Daughters of God are we
[1:01:56] not we're Kings and Priests are we not
[1:01:58] we are rulers in this world Amen we talk
[1:02:01] about being gods me amateur gods and and
[1:02:04] all of these things well then it's time
[1:02:07] that we quit letting the situations rule
[1:02:09] us rule our attitude rule our
[1:02:11] temperament rule our atmosphere rule we
[1:02:15] are Gods miniature Gods amateur God sons
[1:02:19] of God that are to rule amen the
[1:02:22] situation amen see and so but we come up
[1:02:25] with all kinds of excuses and our
[1:02:28] excuses have us actually believing that
[1:02:31] that we cannot pray and that we are
[1:02:33] helpless and and and and and and we
[1:02:37] don't know what to do and and all of
[1:02:39] these things and you know what Satan is
[1:02:41] the one God never supplies you with them
[1:02:44] type of excuses amen it's the devil that
[1:02:47] supplies you with all kinds of excuses
[1:02:49] can you say Amen but there's a reason as
[1:02:52] why he does it for the prophet said
[1:02:54] prayer is the greatest weapon can you
[1:02:57] say that with me prayer is the greatest
[1:03:01] weapon in the world Amen prayer is the
[1:03:05] greatest weapon in the world do you
[1:03:07] believe that amen we read in the Bible
[1:03:10] you know brother Bram talked a lot about
[1:03:12] the Old Testament Saints and you know
[1:03:15] and he used them quite often of of you
[1:03:18] know talking of of of how they overcome
[1:03:21] their enemies and we we read about David
[1:03:24] over coming uh The Lion and the bear and
[1:03:27] and Goliath and and and and and he
[1:03:30] overcome the different powers that come
[1:03:32] at him amen and he was an overcomer
[1:03:35] shamard we look at shamard and what he
[1:03:38] was able to do Samson what he was able
[1:03:41] to do and and and and uh Moses and and
[1:03:45] Joshua and and all of these things and
[1:03:48] and yet these these stories are not to
[1:03:50] be bedtime stories amen they're they're
[1:03:53] not f fictitious stories can you say
[1:03:56] Amen but they are meant to to for us to
[1:04:00] learn by them and draw strength from
[1:04:03] them that if a natural people can take a
[1:04:07] natural weapon under the spirit of God
[1:04:10] and defeat a natural enemy then God and
[1:04:13] they were types and shadows of you do
[1:04:16] you believe that David type of Shadow a
[1:04:18] you shamard and and anyone all the
[1:04:21] saints of old that defeated their enemy
[1:04:24] amen God knew you were coming and he had
[1:04:27] it in the Bible put in the Bible story
[1:04:30] after story after story after Story and
[1:04:33] they all were telling us that you can do
[1:04:36] it as well can you say amen amen that's
[1:04:39] right seed so if the Royal seed they
[1:04:42] they were a natural Seed of Abraham but
[1:04:45] we are the Royal Seed of Abraham and the
[1:04:48] promise was that they that that he told
[1:04:51] God told Abraham thy seed shall possess
[1:04:54] the gates of their enemy do you believe
[1:04:57] that he well that's a promise that ain't
[1:04:59] a might that's a promise hey look look
[1:05:01] at Samson the secret to Samson's uh uh
[1:05:05] Victory and his strength was his long
[1:05:08] hair it was a Nazarite vow unto the Lord
[1:05:11] nothing could conquer him nothing could
[1:05:13] imprison him nothing could defeat him
[1:05:17] nothing could hinder him ain't that
[1:05:19] right but when the enemy found the
[1:05:22] secret to his strength and they cut his
[1:05:25] hair off Samson was like just any Normal
[1:05:28] Man and the enemy was able to make a
[1:05:31] slave out of Samson ain't that right
[1:05:34] well the prophet tells us the secret to
[1:05:36] our strength is a prayer life amen
[1:05:40] prayer life everybody say prayer life
[1:05:43] now think of it it's not just an
[1:05:45] utterance of words that we pray it is a
[1:05:48] weapon against any foe that that would
[1:05:52] come against us it's the greatest weapon
[1:05:55] ever known to man think of the world
[1:05:57] that is trembling amen of uh because of
[1:06:01] the nuclear uh uh Powers uh bombs and uh
[1:06:05] Atomic and whatever you know and and
[1:06:07] they're trembling because the world
[1:06:09] could explode in any moment and and
[1:06:11] threats and all these things and and and
[1:06:14] and it it's incredible but to think of
[1:06:17] the that when you as a Believer get on
[1:06:21] your knees to pray amen the devil
[1:06:26] trembles can you say Amen the devil
[1:06:29] trembles so see if if the enemy is able
[1:06:32] to take away our prayer life then then
[1:06:36] we are just the average and I just be
[1:06:39] honest now we're we're just the average
[1:06:42] churchgoer amen there there's really not
[1:06:45] much difference between us and the rest
[1:06:48] of the world Amen because we we you see
[1:06:52] the prophet said he gave us is the
[1:06:54] strongest weapon that there is in all
[1:06:56] the world and that's prayer prayer is
[1:06:59] what changes things ain't that right see
[1:07:02] the Christian he says doesn't realize
[1:07:04] what a force he has when he goes down on
[1:07:09] his
[1:07:10] knees
[1:07:12] okay all right the Christian doesn't
[1:07:14] know what a force he
[1:07:17] has when he goes on his knees before
[1:07:20] almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:23] he does doesn't realize what power that
[1:07:27] is there is a power that comes with
[1:07:30] kneeling before the
[1:07:33] Lord can you say Amen if the people
[1:07:36] could only realize what was G is given
[1:07:39] right unto them anything everybody say
[1:07:41] anything anything let's say that again
[1:07:44] anything anything that you ask for
[1:07:47] anything that you ask for see he says uh
[1:07:52] uh uh uh will be given if you can
[1:07:55] appropriate the faith to believe it for
[1:07:57] God's word is true ain't that right so
[1:08:00] prayer prayer moves mountains do you
[1:08:03] believe that prayer rolls back the Red
[1:08:05] Seas you believe that it closes the
[1:08:07] mouths of lions yeah prayer takes the
[1:08:10] heat out of the fire prayer does Amen
[1:08:13] I've I've I've wondered you know what
[1:08:16] what is it you young people when you see
[1:08:18] uh uh your elders go through a lot of
[1:08:21] things in their life and and you wonder
[1:08:23] what makes them keep pressing on what is
[1:08:26] it we you know well the secret is is
[1:08:29] prayer amen they can go through the fire
[1:08:32] a lot of times God doesn't take us out
[1:08:33] of the fire but he'll take the heat out
[1:08:35] of the fire amen you see when we Master
[1:08:39] when we understand the weapon that we
[1:08:41] have is by prayer then you're not
[1:08:43] defeated you're not going down a
[1:08:46] defeated person amen you're going down
[1:08:49] with the greatest weapon in your hand
[1:08:51] can you say amen amen prayer is not a
[1:08:54] some little old thing prayer is
[1:08:57] the thing that God gave you to defeat
[1:09:00] the enemy
[1:09:02] with can you say amen Amen brother BR
[1:09:05] said there's no greater power no greater
[1:09:08] power can you say that with me no
[1:09:10] greater
[1:09:11] power in the world than prayer now
[1:09:15] Matthew
[1:09:16] 21:21 Jesus said all things everybody
[1:09:19] say all things all things whatsoever you
[1:09:22] shall ask in in prayer believing you
[1:09:28] shall
[1:09:29] receive now God's word is true do you
[1:09:32] believe that amen see I've thought of uh
[1:09:35] how that uh we read there in the Bible
[1:09:38] where Jesus was directed Amen to go
[1:09:41] somewhere because of somebody was
[1:09:43] praying Mark uh 4:35 it says and the
[1:09:47] same day when the even was come he sath
[1:09:51] unto them let us pass over onto the
[1:09:54] other side and when they had sent away
[1:09:57] the multitude they took him even as he
[1:10:00] was in the ship and there were also with
[1:10:03] him other little ships and there arose a
[1:10:06] great storm of wind and the waves beat
[1:10:08] into the ship so that it was now full
[1:10:11] ain't that right well there's a reason
[1:10:14] why he's going to the other side there's
[1:10:16] a reason why he would say this let's go
[1:10:18] to the other side why because there was
[1:10:20] one Soul one soul that needed help one
[1:10:25] soul that needed him ain't that right
[1:10:29] amen see and there's a reason why Satan
[1:10:32] would cause the winds and the waves to
[1:10:34] try to sink that boat because one
[1:10:37] Soul can you say Amen was coming to
[1:10:40] Victory One Soul was getting his
[1:10:45] deliverance and the one that was going
[1:10:47] to give him that Deliverance was on his
[1:10:51] way can you say Amen you see see there's
[1:10:54] a spiritual warfare a lot of time we
[1:10:55] don't understand Warfare amen but it's a
[1:10:59] spiritual warfare a lot of times Satan
[1:11:02] will try to stop you and you wonder well
[1:11:04] why is it that's that that chaos is
[1:11:06] happening in my home why is it that
[1:11:08] things are just going haywire have you
[1:11:11] ever just stopped to think of what is
[1:11:14] going
[1:11:15] on can you say Amen sure it is see so so
[1:11:20] here Jesus what did Jesus says okay boys
[1:11:22] let's give it up let's go well he
[1:11:24] couldn't do that because he was after
[1:11:27] one Soul right ain't that right so so we
[1:11:31] find that Jesus rebukes the wind he was
[1:11:34] not detoured he he was not bothered he
[1:11:38] just stood there and rebuked the winds
[1:11:39] the waves and said peace be still and he
[1:11:42] continued on ain't that right but now
[1:11:46] notice who it was that he is after Mark
[1:11:49] 5 and one and they came over to the
[1:11:51] other side of the Sea and the country of
[1:11:53] GAD
[1:11:54] and when he come out was come out of the
[1:11:55] ship immediately there met him out of
[1:11:58] the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit
[1:12:01] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[1:12:04] no man could bind him no not with chain
[1:12:09] every man were they they were it it was
[1:12:13] impossible for them to deal with this
[1:12:17] individual can you say Amen welfare
[1:12:21] couldn't help him Church couldn't help
[1:12:24] him doctor of theology could not help
[1:12:27] him Society wasn't there was no program
[1:12:31] that could help
[1:12:33] him come on can you say amen hallelujah
[1:12:36] and he had been bound often with feeds
[1:12:40] and chains and the chains see had been
[1:12:42] plucked asunder by him and the FEDS
[1:12:45] broken in pieces neither could any man
[1:12:48] tame him see this man was
[1:12:52] demonic
[1:12:54] this man wasn't just a human he was
[1:12:58] possessed we're finding more and more
[1:13:00] people are possessed in this age the lid
[1:13:03] of hell has been opened up and demons
[1:13:06] are pouring in that's what the prophet
[1:13:07] said what we're dealing with is people
[1:13:10] that are demon
[1:13:13] possessed let's just face
[1:13:17] it you can blame your children all you
[1:13:19] want to but it's the devil trying to
[1:13:21] wreak havoc come on you can blame your
[1:13:24] spouse all you want to it's the devil
[1:13:25] trying to wreak havoc yes sir can you
[1:13:28] say Amen you can blame the preacher you
[1:13:31] can blame whoever it's the devil trying
[1:13:33] to split the church and cause Division
[1:13:35] and all these things we got to recognize
[1:13:38] the
[1:13:40] enemy what do we do just go change
[1:13:42] church after church after church after
[1:13:45] church do we change and keep voting the
[1:13:47] pastor out and getting another pastor
[1:13:49] and voting another Pastor do we just
[1:13:51] keep doing whatever it ain't going to
[1:13:54] change the
[1:13:58] situation so here it was because he had
[1:14:00] been bound see and and and and and these
[1:14:03] chains were plucked asunder by him and
[1:14:06] the feathers broken in pieces neither
[1:14:09] could any man tame him and always night
[1:14:12] and day he was in the mountains and in
[1:14:14] the tombs crying and cutting himself
[1:14:16] with stones ain't that right but when he
[1:14:19] saw Jesus a far off he ran and worshiped
[1:14:22] him now we all know the story amen that
[1:14:26] that uh uh this man was called Legion
[1:14:28] for there were many but Jesus delivered
[1:14:30] that man can you say Amen Jesus was the
[1:14:34] one that could deliver that man and the
[1:14:36] man was found in his right mind he was
[1:14:39] clothed amen that's right but notice
[1:14:43] what caused Jesus to come after him what
[1:14:46] would cause Jesus to endure the
[1:14:49] hardships amen and you know if I could
[1:14:52] say it this way some sometimes s
[1:14:53] Ministry is not the greatest thing in
[1:14:55] the in in the
[1:14:57] world sometimes there's a lot of
[1:14:59] challenges with Ministry and and to be
[1:15:01] honest all of us should be ministers in
[1:15:03] one way or another you may not be called
[1:15:05] to the pulpit but but you you Mamas are
[1:15:08] are the Fifth Gospel in your home hello
[1:15:11] uh uh well all of us every one of us has
[1:15:14] some type of a Ministry and Ministry is
[1:15:16] to serve and and and and so therefore
[1:15:21] you you you know here Jesus he come to
[1:15:24] seek and to save those that were lost
[1:15:26] and and so here he's coming after that
[1:15:28] one individual and all hell is breaking
[1:15:31] loose but Jesus did not did not detour
[1:15:35] him he kept on he kept on right well
[1:15:38] what would cause him brother Brown said
[1:15:40] he went over there at the Cry of one
[1:15:43] person one person he was willing to go
[1:15:46] through the shipwrecks if if that's what
[1:15:49] it would be the winds and the temptest
[1:15:52] and all of these things that was
[1:15:53] happening he went there for one
[1:15:57] person and he said one poor Maniac lost
[1:16:00] his mind perhaps a good man at one time
[1:16:02] walked uprightly before God but probably
[1:16:05] got in the wrong crowd Maybe started
[1:16:07] drinking or something lost his mind he
[1:16:09] lived out in the tombs where the demons
[1:16:10] Liv put him in Chains and he had
[1:16:12] Supernatural Powers he'd break those
[1:16:14] chains jump on men beat him kill them if
[1:16:16] he could when they come by and that poor
[1:16:19] little fell notice now maybe had an old
[1:16:22] gray-headed mother somewhere praying for
[1:16:25] him aren't you glad there's a prophet
[1:16:28] that could go in in in in in there and
[1:16:30] let us know really what was going on
[1:16:33] there was a gray-haired mother over
[1:16:35] there praying for that man that was her
[1:16:38] boy can you say amen and Jesus crossed
[1:16:42] the sea all the way over to give Mercy
[1:16:45] to one man and he will do the same
[1:16:48] tonight where one humble soul is calling
[1:16:52] on him he'll cross the Seas leave the
[1:16:55] Heavens to answer that prayer it's the
[1:16:59] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:17:02] and forever can you say Amen if it
[1:17:05] worked for that Mama back then it'll
[1:17:06] work for today God has never changed a
[1:17:10] man given his weapons and what weapon he
[1:17:13] gave us it's always been prayer
[1:17:17] hallelujah amen we read about zachus in
[1:17:20] the Bible and how that he was just he
[1:17:22] was just The Sinner he didn't believe
[1:17:24] that Jesus was a prophet but he had a
[1:17:26] Christian wife and re Rebecca right and
[1:17:31] she was a Christian and she prayed for
[1:17:32] him and prayed for him she was a
[1:17:34] follower of Jesus Christ and and and and
[1:17:37] so she prayed for her husband brother BR
[1:17:39] said see you know when you get to
[1:17:41] praying for a fell he kind of gets in a
[1:17:43] bad shape and if you want somebody saved
[1:17:46] now notice how he going to say if you
[1:17:49] want somebody saved don't sit there and
[1:17:52] Grumble about about it take it to
[1:17:57] heart sometimes talking to them ain't
[1:17:59] going to
[1:18:00] work you're talking to the wrong
[1:18:04] person you can tell well you need to
[1:18:06] straighten yourself up when he could
[1:18:07] look at you and say well I probably
[1:18:08] would if I could all
[1:18:11] right can you say Amen ain't it easy
[1:18:15] that we talk to everybody else about it
[1:18:17] instead of our
[1:18:21] God but prayer is talking to the Lord
[1:18:25] that's where the greatest weapon
[1:18:27] is I hope this all right so he says if
[1:18:31] you want somebody saved or something
[1:18:33] done just start praying for them pray
[1:18:37] don't neglect
[1:18:42] prayer it could be dependent on you to
[1:18:45] pray
[1:18:47] okay
[1:18:50] hello how many's got situations you need
[1:18:52] God to work
[1:18:54] on well some of us
[1:18:58] do see prayer you're not
[1:19:02] helpless there's not one of us that is
[1:19:04] helpless
[1:19:05] here now this is fact this is
[1:19:08] truth good prach good so the night
[1:19:13] before Jesus came to their Town Rebecca
[1:19:15] didn't
[1:19:16] sleep she looked out of the corner of
[1:19:18] her eye the prophet said and saw zachus
[1:19:20] and he was all Restless and notice she
[1:19:23] began to pray Lord I know you're dealing
[1:19:25] with him I know you're dealing with him
[1:19:28] why she' been
[1:19:30] praying and now Jesus the prophet is
[1:19:32] coming into the town for this meeting
[1:19:34] down here and I want to see him so bad
[1:19:37] Lord you make a way now just make him
[1:19:42] miserable so here here She is she she's
[1:19:45] she's laying right by by her husband
[1:19:49] amen and this is the prayer that she's
[1:19:51] praying for him oh God God you know not
[1:19:54] not not not make his life okay oh God
[1:19:58] just just you know no make him
[1:20:02] miserable make him
[1:20:04] miserable can you say
[1:20:06] Amen sometimes you know we we we we got
[1:20:10] to just pray God make people
[1:20:13] miserable sometimes he knows how to make
[1:20:15] us miserable don't
[1:20:16] he why so we don't get satisfied with
[1:20:19] where we're
[1:20:21] at yeah brother can you say Amen so so
[1:20:26] you know he said see uh uh uh uh make
[1:20:30] him miserable just make him so he can't
[1:20:32] sleep what a
[1:20:35] prayer he can't even know why he's not
[1:20:40] sleeping and and so there he was he
[1:20:43] couldn't sleep so all right that's fine
[1:20:45] so she had dozed off to sleep laying
[1:20:48] praying all night and he says and if you
[1:20:50] want your husband safe now you do the
[1:20:53] same thing Rebecca did just start
[1:20:56] praying for him ain't that right so he
[1:20:59] says see you know out there on the sea
[1:21:01] when he's got there fishing or down
[1:21:03] there in the business he will get so
[1:21:05] under conviction he can't even sleep and
[1:21:08] if you want your wife Sav you do the
[1:21:10] same thing she'll come away from every
[1:21:12] card party and everything else she
[1:21:14] belongs to why there's great power in
[1:21:20] prayer there's power in prayer
[1:21:23] now acts 1 and8 Jesus said and you shall
[1:21:26] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:29] has come upon you so so you know if if
[1:21:32] if you know we asked I'm sure most of us
[1:21:34] would say I've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:36] well you know the promise is that when
[1:21:39] the Holy Ghost would come to you amen
[1:21:41] then you're going to receive power that
[1:21:43] word of power is Authority dunamus ain't
[1:21:46] that right so there's power now and a
[1:21:49] lot of times the power is not in in our
[1:21:52] action
[1:21:53] as much as it is in prayer so so here
[1:21:57] brother Brown said now you take a a
[1:21:59] person that's lived a good life but
[1:22:00] they're always defeated God help us
[1:22:04] right you take a good person that's
[1:22:06] lived a good life and and but they're
[1:22:08] always defeated oh I tell you see I I
[1:22:11] sure love the Lord Brother brandom but
[1:22:13] always defeated they never get a prayer
[1:22:15] answered you fill that little woman with
[1:22:17] the Holy Ghost one time and watch what
[1:22:19] takes place when she goes before God
[1:22:23] she's not
[1:22:27] defeated she comes boldly to the throne
[1:22:30] of grace believing see because she has a
[1:22:34] right because she is a daughter of God
[1:22:37] by
[1:22:39] birth can you say
[1:22:43] Amen so many
[1:22:45] times we parents can be guilty of trying
[1:22:48] to pacify our
[1:22:50] children by by technology in the of the
[1:22:54] day and appeasing them just to get them
[1:22:57] out of our hair so to speak or just to
[1:22:59] get them quietened down we'll put phones
[1:23:02] or whatever in their way you know and
[1:23:05] and and and and to be honest that's
[1:23:07] really a
[1:23:08] disgrace when we do such things as
[1:23:10] children of
[1:23:12] God because we realize that that a lot
[1:23:16] of times it's a spiritual warfare that's
[1:23:18] what's going on I thought just like
[1:23:20] brother Brown talking of of of how when
[1:23:22] he entered in ma was just you know
[1:23:25] beside herself and you know gray-haired
[1:23:27] there and she crying and and all these
[1:23:30] things and the babies the the children
[1:23:32] were fighting and and fussing and all
[1:23:34] these things y'all remember the story
[1:23:36] see and and brother brandom he didn't
[1:23:39] say okay guys let's all watch a movie
[1:23:41] let let's let's get it all together here

[1:23:45] do this and here's you a phone and here
[1:23:47] let's go play games and and let's get
[1:23:49] them all no no what did he do he just
[1:23:51] hugged his wife and and and and quietly
[1:23:54] he just began to pray God help me oh God
[1:23:57] change the situation oh God change the
[1:24:00] atmosphere can you say Amen why he had
[1:24:03] greater
[1:24:04] Authority now I want to be honest with
[1:24:06] you you don't want technology holding
[1:24:07] power over your
[1:24:10] children that's the devil's way of
[1:24:12] getting to your children right but you
[1:24:14] got a greater way and that's prayer come

[1:27:46] Image yes you believe it so Christ never
[1:27:50] died for Angels no
[1:27:52] ain't that right and Jesus never told
[1:27:55] the Angels if you say to this mountain
[1:27:57] be thou removed and don't doubt in your
[1:27:59] heart it shall be done he never told
[1:28:02] that to Angels he told that to Common

[1:28:30] message it identified us and helped us
[1:28:33] to realize we are sons of God I'm a Son
[1:28:36] of God there was no power in being a
[1:28:39] Pentecostal there was no power in being
[1:28:41] a Baptist there was no power in being
[1:28:43] whatever there's power in being a Son of
[1:28:46] God ain't that right and God would send
[1:28:49] us a message amen and that prophet would
[1:28:52] get into the mind of God and reveal to
[1:28:55] us that we were in his thinking in the
[1:28:59] beginning ain't that right and he never
[1:29:02] thought of us as defeated he never
[1:29:04] thought of us as as someone that is is
[1:29:06] burdened down and a vagabon and helpless

[1:31:42] God help us all amen I know this
[1:31:45] Humanity we we sometimes this Humanity
[1:31:48] causes us to forget these things on but
[1:31:50] may we never forget get them
[1:31:52] things it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:31:55] glory and that's the
[1:31:57] mystery that was revealed in this
[1:32:02] age Bless The Name of Jesus we are part
[1:32:06] of his godhead Christ in you we are made
[1:32:09] in His image and in his likeness you
[1:32:11] realize Angels didn't come from him they
[1:32:14] were a creation but they didn't come
[1:32:17] from
[1:32:18] him but you're more than a creation you
[1:32:21] are a gene seed of God you're part of
[1:32:24] God can you say Amen so we are not a
[1:32:28] separate
[1:32:32] entity
[1:32:36] hello that's what Jesus or or God in the
[1:32:39] creation of man and woman would show
[1:32:42] us he didn't make something separate
[1:32:45] from Adam she was Adam flesh of his
[1:32:48] flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his
[1:32:50] spirit yes sir ain't that what we are
[1:32:55] yeah that's what a prophet said she's
[1:32:57] bone of his bone life of his life Spirit
[1:33:00] of his spirit Power of his power she is
[1:33:06] himen brother Braham said see we become
[1:33:09] part of his word part of his life for we
[1:33:11] are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:33:13] life of his life see so notice what
[1:33:16] Jesus said in he was in Revelations 1 18
[1:33:19] I am Alpha and Omega yeah the beginning
[1:33:23] and the ending say the Lord which is
[1:33:26] which was which is to come the almighty
[1:33:28] can you say Amen so what is alpha mean
[1:33:31] the first what is Omega the last ain't
[1:33:34] that right and the prophet said he never
[1:33:36] said anything in
[1:33:38] between he just said I am Alpha and I am
[1:33:42] Omega the beginning and the end but he
[1:33:45] never said anything in between can you
[1:33:47] say Amen yes sir see so the alpha if he
[1:33:51] is the Alpha and Omega then the AL Omega
[1:33:55] is the same as the alpha same power same
[1:33:58] life same nature same character that's
[1:34:03] right you believe that we saw him as the
[1:34:06] alpha when he walked the Earth yes we
[1:34:08] saw what he was in his first ministry as
[1:34:11] the alpha we saw what he done in his
[1:34:14] ministry as the alpha amen as Alpha he
[1:34:17] was the full manifestation of Jehovah
[1:34:19] God made flesh to dwell Among Us ain't
[1:34:23] that right see so now if he is the Omega
[1:34:27] then everything that he was as ala he
[1:34:30] still is
[1:34:32] today brother B said he's the same in
[1:34:35] every way but his Corporal body amen he
[1:34:38] didn't need his Corporal body to walk on
[1:34:41] the Earth again why got you he redeemed
[1:34:49] you glory glory
[1:34:52] hello he redeemed
[1:34:57] you that now he can be what he was in
[1:35:02] Christ now he can be in
[1:35:08] you isn't that his
[1:35:13] purpose now we're living in the greatest
[1:35:16] age of
[1:35:18] deception Satan's eating perfect
[1:35:25] it God's not worried about
[1:35:29] you on he's not worried about what you
[1:35:32] young people face no no he's not worried
[1:35:36] about what you parents face or pastors
[1:35:38] ministers
[1:35:41] face because he knows who he
[1:35:44] is he's been able to redeem you to where
[1:35:48] he himself now can live and have full
[1:35:50] preeminence
[1:35:53] are you with me full
[1:35:59] preeminence Lord and if he's got full
[1:36:01] preeminence then what devil can bother
[1:36:04] you what devil can destroy you what
[1:36:07] devil can defeat
[1:36:10] you
[1:36:13] Hallelujah well glory to God so brother
[1:36:15] Bram said the first Ministry and the
[1:36:17] last Ministry is the same the first
[1:36:19] message and the second last message
[1:36:21] message is the same I was in Alpha I'm
[1:36:23] in Omega there will be a day that won't
[1:36:25] be called day or night but in the
[1:36:28] evening time it shall be light see Alpha
[1:36:31] and Omega it's become the first and the
[1:36:34] last and he said Alpha has become
[1:36:38] Omega all in another place said all the
[1:36:41] powers that God had rested in Christ and
[1:36:44] the fullness of Christ rests in his
[1:36:48] church amen you believe that amen so he
[1:36:51] said see the last thing that the church
[1:36:53] is going to see is Christ manifested in
[1:36:55] his power in fullness in his
[1:36:59] church can you say Amen just before the
[1:37:02] fire falls he said we're not a divided
[1:37:04] people we've got to be in unity because
[1:37:06] each one of us is holding a part of God
[1:37:10] that's why it's important to come to
[1:37:13] church that's why it's important to
[1:37:15] belong to a
[1:37:18] church
[1:37:20] hello why because each one of us is
[1:37:22] holding a part of God now if you're not
[1:37:24] holding a part of God then don't worry
[1:37:26] about it go go roam around do what you
[1:37:28] want to do but when God calls you to a
[1:37:31] local assembly you are you
[1:37:33] are you are to be uh what is that called
[1:37:37] uh uh loyal to that
[1:37:41] assembly
[1:37:42] hello why God doesn't call you just to
[1:37:45] be be there to be your own little
[1:37:47] individual and everybody you know pamper
[1:37:49] you you hold a part of
[1:37:53] God can you say Amen the church needs
[1:37:59] you ain't that right so we got to be in
[1:38:02] unity we get you see each one of us is
[1:38:04] holding a part of God we must come
[1:38:07] together then the pillar of fire is
[1:38:09] manifested in the wholeness in the
[1:38:12] fullness of it when his church sets
[1:38:14] together in Heavenly places then the
[1:38:16] fullness of the power of God is in his
[1:38:19] church can you say Amen is this all
[1:38:23] right so notice what brother Braham says
[1:38:26] any believer that's got the Holy Spirit
[1:38:28] you have the power of God within you
[1:38:30] yeah how many believes it yes let me ask
[1:38:34] you how many's got the Holy Spirit
[1:38:35] living in you
[1:38:38] right yes sir put your hand up with
[1:38:41] convictions
[1:38:43] now and if he's in you then you have the
[1:38:47] authority to pray the prayer of faith
[1:38:50] that's what a prophet say said you have
[1:38:52] the authority to pray the prayer of
[1:38:54] faith so you're not just coming down and
[1:38:57] you're not just mumbling words and just
[1:39:00] well let's just see what if it happen no
[1:39:02] you come down on your knees realizing
[1:39:06] I've got Authority here that devil is
[1:39:08] going to he's going to pay for
[1:39:11] it he's going to get it because I'm
[1:39:14] getting down on my knees in prayer while
[1:39:18] the world's dependent upon the
[1:39:19] psychologists and doctors and movies and
[1:39:22] entertainment and all that there is a
[1:39:24] group of people that is finding the
[1:39:26] answers on their knees in
[1:39:30] prayer can you say Amen see prayer
[1:39:33] limits the devil it just limits the
[1:39:37] devil amen praise the Lord so you
[1:39:42] realize that prayer is a must can you
[1:39:44] say that with me prayer is a must is a
[1:39:48] say that again prayer is a must pray is
[1:39:50] a must because because God cannot do
[1:39:51] anything for you until you ask for
[1:39:56] it don't go ask the
[1:39:59] president everybody's just crossing
[1:40:01] their fingers hoping Trump gets in he's
[1:40:04] not your
[1:40:06] God he's not a miracle worker right we
[1:40:10] definitely know Biden
[1:40:17] ain't so we get so wrapped up in
[1:40:19] politics and yet there's so many
[1:40:22] disappointed
[1:40:23] people Democrat Republican independent
[1:40:26] whatever you want to
[1:40:28] be so disappointed people and the in
[1:40:31] fears out in the world today because
[1:40:33] people don't know what to do they're
[1:40:35] looking for solid
[1:40:36] answers and they don't have
[1:40:39] them but you
[1:40:42] do so see so therefore now notice in
[1:40:46] Matthew 9:37 Jesus said to his disciples
[1:40:49] the Harvest truly is plent plous but the
[1:40:52] laborers are few pray ye therefore the
[1:40:55] lord of the Harvest that he will send
[1:40:57] forth laborers into his
[1:40:59] harvest the one that was telling them to
[1:41:02] pray was the lord of the Harvest ain't
[1:41:05] that right so brother BR said what he
[1:41:07] was saying is you pray to me that I will
[1:41:10] send laborers into my Harvest which I'm
[1:41:13] just telling you is a needy
[1:41:15] thing but see why couldn't he just do it
[1:41:18] then if he's the lord of the Harvest why
[1:41:20] doesn't he do it it he sees the need he
[1:41:23] said because part of it lays in human
[1:41:26] beings they had to pray they had to ask
[1:41:31] that's
[1:41:32] right now notice how he's directing
[1:41:35] their prayer they don't know that they
[1:41:38] the Harvest is you know uh uh plenteous
[1:41:40] and the laborers are few he puts that in
[1:41:43] them and tells them how to
[1:41:46] pray pray unto me the lord of the
[1:41:49] Harvest pray to the Lord of the Harvest
[1:41:51] that he will send forth labors okay
[1:41:53] let's pray right but he's the lord of
[1:41:56] the Harvest why didn't he do it because
[1:41:58] brother Brown says this see the kingdom
[1:42:01] everybody say the kingdom of God lays
[1:42:04] within human
[1:42:06] beings so God is not going to P bypass
[1:42:10] you Hallelujah can you say
[1:42:14] Amen oh wouldn't that be nice we know we
[1:42:17] have problems wouldn't it just be nice
[1:42:19] God just answers every time I mean just
[1:42:22] gives it to us and we don't have nothing
[1:42:23] to do just just just just he just sends
[1:42:26] all the blessings no no no he's not
[1:42:28] going to bypass you you've got to get on
[1:42:31] your
[1:42:32] knees you got to ask ask can you say
[1:42:36] Amen so he says see you asked me to do
[1:42:39] what I know needs to be done but you got
[1:42:41] to ask me see if you want to know the
[1:42:44] will of God for your life pray amen amen
[1:42:49] that's right pray
[1:42:54] oh I just I just wish I could go do
[1:42:55] something I I know a lot of guys want to
[1:42:57] go be an evangelist I got them in my
[1:42:59] church one to just go be an Evangel but
[1:43:01] no one's calling them so I don't know
[1:43:03] what to do I don't I just
[1:43:08] pray
[1:43:10] pray aren't you serving the same God
[1:43:12] that we all serve can God open the doors
[1:43:15] if he wants them open that's right right
[1:43:18] can God do something for you
[1:43:22] see I I if you need God to do something
[1:43:25] for you what do we do
[1:43:29] pray can you say Amen if you want the
[1:43:32] blessings of God pray see James 5:14 is
[1:43:36] any sick among you let him call for the
[1:43:38] Elders of the church let them pray over
[1:43:40] him anointing him with allil in the name
[1:43:42] of the Lord and the prayer of faith
[1:43:45] everybody say the prayer of faith fath
[1:43:47] shall save the sick physically
[1:43:52] spiritually and the Lord shall raise him
[1:43:54] up and if he have committed sins they
[1:43:57] shall be forgiven him confess your
[1:43:59] faults one to another and pray for one
[1:44:01] another that you may be healed the
[1:44:03] effectual everybody say the effectual
[1:44:06] fervent prayer of a righteous man Glory
[1:44:10] availeth
[1:44:11] much can you say Amen as I get ready to
[1:44:15] close
[1:44:17] now brother Braham said when the weakest
[1:44:19] of saints fall on their knees the Devils
[1:44:25] tremble you don't have to live your life
[1:44:27] in
[1:44:29] confusion you don't have to keep beating
[1:44:31] your head against the wall to try to
[1:44:32] make things
[1:44:34] happen the best thing for us to do is
[1:44:37] pray that's right okay you young people
[1:44:41] you want to know what God you know your
[1:44:43] your pattern for Your Life future for
[1:44:46] your life learn to
[1:44:49] pray learn to pray can you say
[1:44:52] Amen brother Bram said what a power and
[1:44:55] a privilege has been given to the Church
[1:44:57] of the Living
[1:44:59] God now this word effectual fervent
[1:45:02] means
[1:45:04] desperation the desperate prayer of a
[1:45:08] righteous
[1:45:09] man in other words what he does is he
[1:45:12] stays with it until it's answered right
[1:45:18] yes I think sometimes as I get ready to
[1:45:21] close but sometimes we're so used to
[1:45:23] everything just right then right now
[1:45:25] right now right now right
[1:45:26] now so we pray for five minutes and
[1:45:30] something very crucial in our lives that
[1:45:31] we need God to really do we just pray
[1:45:33] for that five minutes we we said our
[1:45:35] prayer but sometimes it has to be a
[1:45:37] desperate
[1:45:39] prayer sometimes it it a fervent you
[1:45:43] know the Bible talks about
[1:45:46] Elijah being a man of life like
[1:45:51] passion as we are he had his UPS he had
[1:45:55] his
[1:45:56] Downs he had his times of differences
[1:46:00] and disappointments but he was a
[1:46:02] righteous man who
[1:46:05] prayed and brother brandom say see no
[1:46:08] man is righteous only the Son of God so
[1:46:11] we don't stand and I don't stand in my
[1:46:12] righteousness I stand in his
[1:46:14] righteousness so as long as I'm Anointed
[1:46:17] with him it's the effectual fervent
[1:46:19] prayer of the right
[1:46:21] Christ interceding for you through me to
[1:46:24] have you to believe ain't that right
[1:46:28] so a lot of times our prayer is a prayer
[1:46:32] of inter interceding intercession
[1:46:35] intercession we're making intercession
[1:46:38] for prayer for
[1:46:39] others and if you notice Elijah he was
[1:46:44] the prophet for the age of
[1:46:46] Israel the children of Israel was in
[1:46:49] trouble
[1:46:53] and having a burden for them and having
[1:46:56] you know he he he stood in between a lot
[1:46:59] of things from the evil and the good and
[1:47:01] all that but he began to
[1:47:04] pray the Bible says he prayed earnestly
[1:47:07] that it might not rain can you say
[1:47:10] Amen here he was a prophet the word of
[1:47:13] the Lord come to that prophet and yet
[1:47:15] all the prophets had to
[1:47:16] pray they had to get on their knees they
[1:47:19] they they had to seek God for answers it
[1:47:22] didn't come to them easily and you say
[1:47:24] Amen see because prayer is a law of God
[1:47:28] James 4:2 says you ask not you have not
[1:47:30] because you ask not in other words you
[1:47:33] pray not brother Bram said see you don't
[1:47:35] ask you don't pray because you don't
[1:47:37] believe ain't that right and so the
[1:47:40] Bible says that it rained not on Earth
[1:47:42] for the space of three years in six
[1:47:45] months then James 5:18 says and he
[1:47:48] Elijah prayed again and the heaven gave
[1:47:51] rain and the Earth brought forth her
[1:47:54] fruit but in case you don't know Elijah
[1:47:58] just didn't pray one
[1:48:00] time he just didn't get down and say
[1:48:02] Lord you know I love you we're needing
[1:48:05] rain
[1:48:06] today amen
[1:48:09] no he was a man that knew how to pray
[1:48:13] fervently can you say Amen so First
[1:48:17] Kings 18:41 and Elijah said to Ahab get
[1:48:21] thee up and drink eat and drink for
[1:48:22] there's a sound of abundance of
[1:48:26] rain so Elijah must have had a
[1:48:30] vision of it raining or he wouldn't have
[1:48:32] said that to Ahab so Elijah or so Ahab
[1:48:37] the 42nd verse Ahab went up to eat and
[1:48:39] drink notice Ahab goes and eat and
[1:48:43] drink and Elijah went up to the top of
[1:48:47] Carmel and cast himself down down on the
[1:48:50] earth and put his face between his
[1:48:53] knees why because Elijah is praying for
[1:48:57] rain wow so he tells he tells Ahab I
[1:49:01] hear it it's
[1:49:04] coming that he's going up to the
[1:49:07] mountain and he's praying to
[1:49:09] God God Send the Rain God send the rain
[1:49:14] this this this wasn't just some little
[1:49:16] thing for him can you say amen and he
[1:49:19] said to his servant go what now look
[1:49:22] toward the sea and he went up and looked
[1:49:24] and said there's
[1:49:27] nothing and Elijah said go again how
[1:49:32] many times did he do that seven
[1:49:35] times a prophet of God already told the
[1:49:39] king it's going to
[1:49:41] rain and he prays the first time nothing
[1:49:44] happens does he stop no gets back on his
[1:49:48] knees and he begins to pray doesn't say
[1:49:51] how long he prayed he just
[1:49:53] prayed nothing happens he gets back on
[1:49:56] his knees seven times but he's
[1:49:59] desperate I got to get the answer can
[1:50:02] you sayen I got to get an answer amen I
[1:50:05] got to get an
[1:50:09] answer he knew that God was
[1:50:11] living he knew that God would answer oh
[1:50:15] Jesus may it become in
[1:50:17] us to really know that God answers
[1:50:23] prayer right this isn't just a little
[1:50:25] thing that we
[1:50:26] do this isn't just a little obligation
[1:50:29] okay I've said my prayers for today now
[1:50:31] let's
[1:50:32] move no God answers
[1:50:38] prayers ain't that
[1:50:40] right and if he ain't answered your
[1:50:43] prayer don't stop
[1:50:47] praying you don't have to be tore up
[1:50:51] you don't have to be all out of sort
[1:50:53] none of us have to if we can just result
[1:50:56] in prayer just turn to God in prayer and
[1:51:01] begin to pray knowing that he will
[1:51:04] answer our
[1:51:05] prayer you love
[1:51:08] him if the musicians will
[1:51:14] come I thought of the time
[1:51:18] that the shite woman her son had died
[1:51:21] and
[1:51:22] she goes to
[1:51:26] Elijah she wouldn't leave and until
[1:51:29] Elisha comes down to the house to pray
[1:51:31] for the child and
[1:51:36] yeah the Bible says that he went in
[1:51:39] Elisha the prophet went in therefore and
[1:51:41] shut the door upon them Twain and prayed
[1:51:43] unto the Lord now that's all we hear as
[1:51:46] he prayed unto the Lord maybe just a
[1:51:48] simple little prayer that we would think
[1:51:51] but the prophet tells
[1:51:53] us that when Elisha walked in and shut
[1:51:56] that door and he's there alone he prayed
[1:52:01] and he
[1:52:02] prayed and he
[1:52:06] prayed Elisha got
[1:52:09] desperate yeah CU he knew that child was
[1:52:13] a
[1:52:15] promise he knew that woman was
[1:52:18] believing yes you understand what I'm
[1:52:20] saying see
[1:52:22] people and I hope this is all right but
[1:52:26] people do you realize that a lot of
[1:52:29] people are depending on
[1:52:32] us why your lost loved ones are
[1:52:35] depending on
[1:52:37] you why because you have contact with
[1:52:43] God Satan's ravaged them Satan's got
[1:52:46] them in the mind and torment and
[1:52:47] everything
[1:52:48] else there's so many of our loved ones
[1:52:51] that maybe are just believing that
[1:52:53] they're lost
[1:52:54] forever that there is no way to get back
[1:52:57] and they've send their day of Grace away
[1:52:59] but there's
[1:53:00] someone that knows the mercy of God and
[1:53:03] says no he's alive today and he's given
[1:53:06] me a promise isn't that what the promise
[1:53:10] was given to the mothers no matter how
[1:53:12] waver your children is no matter no
[1:53:15] matter no matter how
[1:53:18] wavered if you have enough faith for
[1:53:20] yourself believe for your loved one
[1:53:22] believe for them and no matter how wward
[1:53:25] they are even if God has to put them on
[1:53:27] the deathbed they'll be
[1:53:29] saved that's a
[1:53:35] promise it's a promise can you say
[1:53:38] Amen oh do you love him isn't he
[1:53:41] wonderful so Jesus taught us to be
[1:53:44] persistent with our prayer Luke 1817 and
[1:53:47] I promise you I'll let you go
[1:53:51] but Jesus said he spake a parable unto
[1:53:53] them to this end that men ought always
[1:53:55] to pray and not to
[1:53:59] faint saying there was a city in a city
[1:54:02] a judge which feared not God neither
[1:54:04] regarded man and there was a widow in
[1:54:07] that City and she came unto him saying
[1:54:10] avenge me of M adversary and he would
[1:54:12] not for a while but afterward he said
[1:54:14] within himself though I fear not God nor
[1:54:16] regard man yet because this wi TR troubl
[1:54:19] me I will avenge her lest by her
[1:54:21] continuing coming she weary me and the
[1:54:24] Lord said hear what the unjust judge
[1:54:26] saith and shall not God avenge his own
[1:54:29] elect which CED day and night unto him
[1:54:33] though he bear long with
[1:54:36] them he said well go God ain't answering
[1:54:39] my prayer right away but what are you
[1:54:41] going to do about it just stop give up
[1:54:45] NOP prayer of faith prayer of faith
[1:54:48] knows that God's going to answer some
[1:54:50] someday prayer of faith knows that God's
[1:54:52] going to
[1:54:53] answer can you say Amen Matthew 7:7 ask
[1:54:57] and it shall be given seek and you shall
[1:54:59] find and it shall be open unto you for
[1:55:02] everyone that
[1:55:04] askthe findeth and to him that knocketh
[1:55:06] it shall be open or what man is there of
[1:55:10] you whom if he ask his if his son asked
[1:55:14] bread will he give him a stone if he ask
[1:55:17] a fish will he give him a serpent if ye
[1:55:20] then being evil know how to give good
[1:55:21] gifts unto your children how much more
[1:55:23] shall your father which is in heaven
[1:55:25] give good things to them that ask him
[1:55:27] can you say
