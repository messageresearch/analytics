absolute best thing that I've ever done I'm so thankful for his amen his love to me and I'm sure you are too amen so thankful for the grace of God Upon Our Lives if he had to loved you first you would know nothing about loving him and I'm so thankful for his great love here tonight amen well are you glad to be in church tonight amen praise the Lord glory to God well we um I think we'll just get right on into the scriptures here tonight here in Isaiah the 53rd chapter we appreciate our musicians and uh appreciate brother Austin there and and I have sure been enjoying uh brother Josh there on the guitar too and um uh love love the guitar and and um uh brother Merl usually doesn't lead songs on Sunday nights but we appreciate him doing that tonight amen and uh I I thinking this morning as I came out and seen these uh all of these uh beautiful young people uh up here on on the front and and uh these boys and girls and you know we just I just love these kiddos and and so thankful for what God's doing in their lives as well this is not a this is not a uh an old man's religion now amen God loves people he loves every one of you young and old he loves every one of you and so we're thankful to God for that Isaiah 53 and 1 it says who hath believed I report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground and he hath no no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and and we hid as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs somebody say our griefs our grief and carried what our our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions Hallelujah he was bruised for our iniquity ities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and let's read this together and with his stripes we are healed now Peter would pick it up there in in 1 Peter 2 and 24 he says who his own self bear our sins in his own body now listen to this listen to this language who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live in under righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed now it was a promise back in Isaiah it was a fulfillment here in Peter let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your love thank you for your compassion upon your people Lord when I when I spoke it while ago that God loves people I could just feel your presence just something come over me Lord I know you love people God it doesn't matter whether we're young whether we're old Lord it doesn't matter whether we have our lives put together or we're just some of those that that just can't seem to quite put it together you love us all and God we thank you for that and we want you to know that we love you we love you Lord with all of our heart and we're asking that you would forgive us for all of our foolishness and our our nonsense Lord thankful for your patience and your love to us Lord as we Minister this evening on healing I I pray Lord that your presence would just remain with us and that you would Minister to all of our needs heal every sick person among us and we'll give you Glory and Honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight amen James 514 is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if Heath committed sins they shall be forgiven him so we ministered this morning centering on the heart and and anything that we receive from God there it's we've got to have a it's got to come from the heart and not the mind and I think I I think I've I I pretty well got my point across when it's not in the mind you believe not with the mind you're not dictated to your mind mind is okay amen you you can you you can use your mind for amen uh God give you your mind and so you choose amen uh what kind of ice cream do I want what color of dress do I want to wear what kind of uh what kind of a girl do I want what kind of a amen job am I going to pick you you you use your mind for this body if your the spirit man is the nature of the flesh amen but God's placed a a an an eternal nature within you that's the soul that's what he communicates with and then that soul from that solish Rim there's where you govern amen uh uh the body and spirit and so we've got to understand that as the soul is is completely anchored with Christ amen I made a statement this morning that body is still owned by the devil amen it's it's not it's not coming to its completion amen it hasn't been redeemed yet that's the reason why we have sickness and and things that still hang on to us even as Christians the most devout of Christians can lose their mind the most devout of Christians can amen have sorrows and troubles and brother brandham would and I got that from right here where where brother brandham would say Amen now let's talk about the death side he says now how could a person on on that estate in that in that kind of condition ever be sick because your body is not redeemed yet your body is not redeemed no matter how much how good you are how saintly how holy how much Holy Spirit that's only your soul and your soul is is uh amen uh is is not completed yet it's it's just got the blessing the promise of God which is the earnest of our salvation but now we have no Earnest of our resurrect uh if we have no Earnest of our Resurrection no Divine Healing then I'll have no Assurance or nothing to prove to me that there is a resurrection so now so brother Bron was trying to tell us God gives us the earnest of uh of the Resurrection he wants to prove that there is a resurrection through Divine Healing so it's God's will to heal God does not put sickness on people he is not the author of sickness he is not the author of death God when Christ came the Bible says there there in Acts 20 for that God was with him and healed all that were oppressed of the devil can you say amen amen so is it God's will uh to heal me well you know we humans just make things weird not God God in all of the Bible has has said over and over and over it's his will to heal it's not God making us feel bad making us think that maybe he won't no no no no you find a place where in the Bible where it says it's not his will to heal it's God's will to heal and the reason why amen we don't get our healing is because because we've got some kind of theology amen that says well maybe maybe not maybe maybe not if you're going to receive anything from God you're going to have to get that double-mindedness out of you and you're going to have to believe God from the heart and accept it as God's will for you can you say Amen yes he is willing come on he spilled his blood for you amen Jesus has a table spread the saints of God are fed amen is that right he wants you to come around amen and to be fed and and brother brother brandham would say amen he would take this and he would he would say now he says now if I were to come to your house and I if I have been asked to come over and and you say preacher come eat with me and he says I believe you love me amen you had beans and potatoes and carrots and fruit fried chicken and pumpkin pie and ice cream everything sitting there well I believe I'd be just as welcome to the potatoes as I was to the beans the only thing I believe I'd be just as welcome to the chicken as I was to the pie it's all on the table the only thing I have to do is say would you please pass me some pie I believe with a good free heart if you if you love me you would say certainly my brother have a nice big piece of it that's right if IID say uh would you pass me the potatoes why certainly my brother here it is and every Redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ died for and purchased in his atonement at Calvary is sitting on the table every believer is sitting before it Hallelujah if I need healing I say father p ask me some healing and I pour it out on the plate and I eat a big can you say amen amen that's right so healing is God's will healing is in the atonement amen so so I I I you know the Apostle Paul amen he he didn't pray for just your soul he didn't pray for just your mind but there in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 he says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy somebody say holy amen that is wh o l l y Ho Holy both Body Spirit and soul can you say Amen that was his prayer amen and he wanted it to be preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord you know what that means when you when you need healing amen you you can you can expect God to help you and to and to heal your body when you've got mind problems you can you need peace you can come and say God I need my spirit man restored when you need renewing amen that's what you that that's the that's that's where we stand now I'm not talking about hope there's a difference in Hope and Faith Hope says one of these days a at some point amen somewhere I know God is going to heal me faith says I know it's already done that's right hope says there's going to come a time amen where the will of God will all come in and the and the stars are going to line up and everything going to work out and I'm going to be healed that's wonderful that's hope your stars may never line up the word has been spoke the lamb has already paid the price and you've got to take your faith and appropriate that Faith to the word of God Amen amen I I'm not one of those guys where the stars line up too often but I tell you what I can believe God's word and I can expect healing amen and I'm here to tell you I'm I I've even been experiencing that this last year God doing things for me amen God is our healer God is our provider God is good to his people amen now brother Brandon would say you now if you just rely on Hope You Hinder Faith Hope looks for something way off amen Faith claims it right now faith says God said so in it's mind that settles it I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mine right now and God said so and that settles it that's Faith he says but folks but but but hope says God said so and I'm expecting to get it someday amen yes uh you see I expecting someday as long as Satan can put it off to another day that's as good as he wants that's right you'll never get it just believe you've got it right now it is your personal property faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen is that right Faith acts now it is positive oh my I tell you sickness and everything else when Faith steps in it's like a snowball on a hot stove it just melts away everything goes away from Faith because Faith stands up takes over the rule and when Faith speaks everybody else keeps still Hallelujah he says these little old sicknesses and uh you know uh buring it around like that and little old things and saying well the days of Miracles has passed and this that and the other but let Faith step up one time put his muscles amen and say I'll take over I tell you the rest of them uh keep still When Faith does it that's the fellow we want to deal with amen is that right he says now how do we get faith faith comes by hearing hearing what the word of God now it now that's right you can't base it on nothing else but the word of God it's got to have now if you if you just now you just can't have faith you well I if if if you go over here and touch that it'll make you well or now touch the radio or touch this or the other that just can't do it no sir I got to have something that's strong amen the strongest thing I know of is the word of God now amen so we want Faith to be built on the word of God and I want us to take I want to I want to blow hope out of the water tonight if I can by God's help and I want us to be able to look and to see God's intention on healing first of all God has always provided healing throughout the Bible God's always provided healing throughout the Bible amen there in Psalms uh 103 and 2 we all know it the great psalmist wrote amen it says bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgives all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases does he still forgive our iniquities then he still heals our sicknesses if he still saves he still heals well now now now now brother wend now we know that God doesn't heal everybody it's and and we also know God doesn't save everybody don't we but if there is something in you that wants to be saved that means there is salvation for you to be had if there's something in you that wants to be whole that means there's something in here that God wants to respond to but it requires a deep responding to the Deep God can be saying I I want to save you but if you ain't got nothing in here that wants to be saved amen you're never going to receive it but brother if you've got something in your heart that is saying I want that salvation I promise you you will hear from God and you'll find deliverance and salvation and brother you want healing in your body and you're Desiring that tonight then that means that God is right there ready to heal youall that's amen what about the pool of Bethesda God always no matter what situation I don't care where they were at God always provided amen he always provided a way of healing they're they're in the pool of Bethesda there hadn't been a prophet in years and they they're man they had went through backsliding 400 years amen without Prophet between the Old Testament Malachi and and and the New Testament but even in that time God provided a way of healing for the people even in that backslid in Israel God provided that when when when the would get would would would get sick they could come to a certain pool the pool of Bethesda and God would come down at certain Seasons amen and and and he would strable those Waters so that the sick could be whole can you say Amen aren't you glad that God's a merciful god amen I'm I'm glad that he's a merciful god Israel in the wilderness amen when sickness would would come because of their own sin God would stand up and say I am the god that Health thee amen what caused sickness what caused death in the first place it was sin if there was no sin there would never have been sickness that's right if there had not been sin then there would never be disease there would be no death but it was because of Adam decision Adam sold you and me out when he made the decision Amen to follow the the the the way of Satan there in there in in in Matthew 5 and12 it says wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin did you catch that amen as one man by one man sin entered in the world and death by sin so death death is passed upon all men for all for that all have sinned so now we see that the disease is the physical penalty amen of iniquity the day you eat will be the day that you die right amen that is spiritually and that is physically so so where let me ask you where does sickness and disease come from it come from sin right did disease and sickness come from God no where did it come from where did Death come from it came because one man sinned and death has reigned ever since so did Death come from God no God's not the author of death God's not the author of sickness amen well praise the Lord amen in fact there in Acts 10:38 it says how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him now if God wasn't interested in healing then God wouldn't have anointed Jesus but God anointed Jesus you say now this is pretty simple and I want to put it very simple I want you to catch this tonight that the Simplicity of the Gospel will produce Miracles and healings in our lives amen amen now I want us to look over the blood for just a moment first things first it was God who came running after Adam right it wasn't Adam running after God Adam disobeyed and God was fixing God was driving him out but then God stopped him and he says I tell you what I'm going to keep my word amen but before you leave I'm going to shed the blood of this innocent one and I'm going to cover you with that Lamb's skins as a type of its righteousness amen he made an atonement for Adam to cover over to make re reconciliation to atone for can you say Amen so it was God that was the first to stay the lamb now many of times we talk about the Old Testament and the blood and the blood offerings we know that that that Abel offered and a a a more excellent sacrifice we know that throughout all of the Old Testament it was Abraham offered under God a lamb we we find I mean that that was part of the worship amen but the first want to do the to to do the slaying of the Lamb it was not a man at all it was God it was God who made the reconciliation oh I think that's beautiful it was God that done it for Humanity can you say amen amen that's what he' done through Christ it was God who slew him now the blood is the only thing that could satisfy the courts of Heaven God was the first to slay that lamb Abel was the first human to offer blood to God Abraham uh uh offered to God Noah offered a lamb up to God Amen in the Passover it was a blood that was required Aaron the high priest would have the blood as he entered into the holiest of holies so without blood there would there would be no salvation there would be no acceptance there would there would have to be the blood of an innocent one Amen to take the penalty of sin now what would happen what would happen when the sin question is dealt with the cross of Jesus Christ paid the debt the soul was redeemed now I want you to catch it if the soul is redeemed then the body must also be released judicially from diseases the only reason uh death and and disease and sickness comes is because of sin if Jesus Paid the price and you accept that atonement then you have a right to come before God and believe that healing is for you yeah amen praise the Lord now the Holy Ghost is the first fruits of our spiritual salvation brother bradam said healing is the first fruits of our body change amen now now who can who can remove that curse from you now here's the deal doctors tell us and they do what they can do right they will set your leg the doctor will amen they can they they can set your your your broken bone but only God can heal the arm right they can give you medicines they can cut out cancer but only God can heal that's right you can take vitamins and minerals and you can try all of these things but that cannot remove the curse it requires a Believer to come up stand before God and to tell that devil I'm redeemed amen and I have a right to accept my healing amen amen when the blood pressure is high and the doctor says listen it's it's something that has been going on down through generation after generation you have a right as a Son of God to stand up before God and say father you have redeemed me from my sin I have a right judicially that's right amen it's been paid for I am no longer under con under condemnation that's Hallelujah I have a right to come up before God and say I'm asking for the healing of this high blood pressure you have a right for that and there's nothing the devil can do to keep it from you amen unless you're believing here and not standing upon the word of God God that he's given you here that's right I I want y'all to catch me here tonight now listen you can have your vitamins and minerals and amen and S nature you can eat your veggies and you can you can you can heat right and all that but but we're in a dying body amen and and and but but while we're here we can still believe God for our healing amen and our deliverance well can you say amen amen amen so the question is did Jesus redeem us from our diseases at the same time that he redeemed our soul from sin I would say there's only one cure amen for sickness and disease and that's that lamb that died for your soul amen yes sir amen amen he died for both the blood atones for both the sin sick soul and the disease written body Jesus Christ has paid the penalty today now Israel is a type of a Believer today amen and and they were required to apply the blood and to eat the Flesh of the Lamb the very first communion service that was ever held was in Egypt Acts or or Exodus the 12th chapter and they were to kill a lamb and and and they were to paint the blood amen upon the door uh post and the lentils and they were to eat the unleavened bread with the roasted lamb they were to eat it while totally clothed amen their shoes had to be on their feet they had to be packed and ready to leave Egypt this was going to be a supernatural event the death angel was going to strike amen and it was going to be in the most evil of evil times as the death angel was striking the firstborn all over Egypt it did not matter whether you were living in in uh whether you were a Jew or whether you were an Egyptian the blood was the only thing that was going to keep death away from those houses can you say amen amen now you know uh uh uh they had to be at that same house amen you could not say well I you know I only need the blood and I don't have to eat the lamb or i i i i amen I'm eating the lamb but I'm not under the blood no no no no no you had to do it the way God said to do it they both had to be it and it was a state of urgency that was in the air they were to eat this shoes on their feet stabs in their hand packed and ready to leave Egypt there in Exodus 12: 11 and you shall eat it with your loins gted shoes on your feet staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the the Lord's Passover now now this was this was fixing to be something that amen that it was it was a declaration brother we're fixing to have our last passover we're fixing to go in a Rapture and everything that we do we've got to do with haste amen amen when you leave sin you need to leave sin with haste when you're amen everything we do we should be sincere the deepest of sincerity when we come before the Lord can you say amen amen the blood of the Lamb the death angel was striking that night amen you go to the 12th verse it says for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt can you say amen amen so so we can see the urgency of the hour amen I want you to know death is in the land now I want to tell you brother bradam says back in the 50s he says what is coming upon the Earth he said cancer is going to be a toothache compared to what is coming there's going to be so many plagues that come upon the Earth that the doctors won't even have anything and brother we're here amen we we we the doctors just can't seem to do find anything to help anybody anymore amen you know they can do one thing and it kills the other part of you amen but the blood shall be a token unto you and the Death Angel shall not come near your dwelling because the blood now brother I want you to catch that amen I want you to see that now huh there was going to be from that brother Bram taught us that that Passover because of the eating of that lamb and the partaking of that blood brother brandham says out of two and a half million people none of them left Egypt that were feeble okay Hallelujah the old now now now listen when you've got two and a half million people they mind you're going to have some old folks and you're going to have some babies and you're going to have some snotty noses and you're going to have some sickness out of two and a half million but the scripture says when they left Egypt there was not a feeble one that's some pretty strong atonement if the blood of a lamb can provide that kind of an atonement with God how much more can the blood of Jesus Christ bring such an atonement your way that I Hallelujah I don't care whether you're old or whether you're a baby or middle AG it can bring you out without one Fe I I believe we can go in the Rapture that way I personally believe that when you Elders when it's time for you Elders to go home you can just lay down fold your hands and say mama I'll see you on the other side I believe we can do that that's right that's true well praise the Lord amen Satan said well you're old Satan says well you know you've got to expect that you know you can't expect too much more I mean you're old you're supposed to be diseased you're supposed to be blind you're supposed to be having pains I want to tell you the prophet of God says age doesn't matter to God that's right but if he can use this instead of this you'll suc come to this and you'll say well this pain is just part of my age I want to tell you you can stand upon God's word to believe God for healing no matter how old you are well praise the Lord Amen brother Bram says so what what does old age or anything else matter not a thing God gave the promise the Holy Spirit rules the church the Holy Spirit brought you here and the whole thing is wrapped up into the holy spirit it's not what you think care it's what he's done here that's true amen I'm going to read another one for you elders Hallelujah Moses was 80 years old and and God come down and revealed himself right there in the pillar of fire and says hey young man what don't you go down there and deliver all of Israel well praise the Lord Amen brother brandham says look look at Moses how radical that made him act what did he do that man 80 years old will you say brother W brother brandom I'm I'm getting to a middle age down now man I'm I'm an old man I don't care how old you are that don't have one thing to do with it the day that God can get you quiet enough to speak to you and you hear his word that's the day he's talking to you no matter your age someone say hallelujah hallelujah it don't matter I don't care whether you're you're you're one of these young here on the on the front row or or whether you're an elder you can believe God hallelujah amen God doesn't look at age brother brother brandham says now they to obey his word I Lay My Hands on yours amen the name of Jesus Christ this the woman in the discernment line Amen in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I loose This Heart trouble as as his representative and now Satan you whove bound her and trying to take her to the Grave yet she's aged but our God doesn't look at age I come to serve you a warrant on you as a representative of Calvary as God's agent and you cannot stay in this house any longer you have to move out because of uh you uh because you cannot stay in this house because as the Holy Spirit the detective of God who's here and your secret places are revealed You Can't Hide any longer and by the power of the almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ cursed be the heart trouble of this woman and may she be loosed now amen in jesus' name go God's peace be upon you oh brother wend now I don't know I just want you Elders to know that God you have fought this battle a long time you have you have pressed through for all of us young people and I believe it's God's desire to heal you and to make you comfortable in your later years I believe it's God's will for you Elders to be healed I believe I brother I believe you can't I can't tell you how much I believe that I believe God wants to heal you [Applause] Elders he loves you Elders you Elders have stood for him you Elders have have have P have paved the way for us young ones to come God bless you Elders don't you listen to that Lon devil that tries to torment your mind you can stand in faith and believe God's word that's true Amen brother and sister kid were in their 70s amen and and and brother brandham says man he says now I happen to look around here to see brother and sister kids sitting here not long ago a doctor made a sound the old man was dying and I like to burn the tires off my car to get up there to say goodbye to him when I got up there in the room one morning the holy spirit said no he ain't going to die see here he is he I heard he's gained 25 lbs now that's a certain sound that's certainty if God says so it is so we can stand upon the promises of God Brother D was 91 years old don't you listen to that old come big mouth that old devil trying to tell you that you can't be and that you he's a liar God you you God loves you elders just as he's always done the scripture says that there was not a feeble one among them amen Psalms 105 and 37 he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes I don't know about you brother but the blood had that the blood under the old Covenant had that kind of effect how much more will the blood under this new covenant [Applause] can you say Amen yes the lamb the prophet of God would saying I'll get to it in a minute but the lamb was the physical strength for the journey as they would eat that lamb and what are we doing we are eating the lamb the lamb the word was made flesh so this word is the Lamb that we are eating and it's giving us strength for the Journey giving us strength in our bodies giving us healing when we're sick giving us giving us encouragement when we're discouraged as we eat this lamb we become strengthened by that word amen hallelujah now the atonement provided a way we get this we get this all mixed up Sister Karen we think God's only interested in our souls God became a human yeah to live with humans yeah to feel like a human to heal a human to intercede for humans right in their weaknesses that's right in fact when we get to heaven the only God you're going to see is a human being I said the only God you're going to see is in the body of the man Jesus Christ you mean to tell me that God's only concerned for your soul God lives in a body yeah true yeah the scripture says there in Deuteronomy 29 and5 watch this he says I have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxing old upon you and thy shoe is not waxing all upon your feet that atonement did not just cover the soul it covered the strength there was not a feeble one it covered right it provided shoes for them it provided clothes for them God was interested in every part of that journey and I'm here to tell you God is interested in your job God is interested in who you marry God is interested in your hurt God is interested in your Amen in in your deepest of pains God is interested in the human being Hallelujah true good point that's why when I deal with Ministry I find somebody that's not not willing to put their make it you know inconvenience themselves for somebody else I find that they've not really been touched by God yet amen because God loves people and when you're so touched by God you might be in convenience a time or two or maybe a three or four or a hundred times in your life but you're willing to go the extra mile if your brother asks for your coat then or your cloak or your coat give him your cloak also if he ask you to go one one mile then you go two miles that's why because it exhibits the heartbeat of God God loves people that's right oh can you say amen amen now now brother brandham says now when you receive this bread this is a communion remember it represents the lamb long years ago when Israel's lamb was roasted on over fire and was taken with bitter herbs the people had strength their shoes never wore out their clothes never become threadbear all through the Journey till they hit their Promised Land may God keep us healthy happy serving him until we reach the promised land that he has given us how many believes that we can accept that prayer for us I'm a message believer that Prophet was praying that prayer over his people is he not the seventh angel messenger are we not living in the seventh Church age can we not accept that prayer for ourselves amen that's may God keep us healthy and happy serving him until we reach now watch now watch just just just watch when they were going through the Journey and when they come and the water was bitter the atonement right provided water for them sure sure did it provided Sweet Water God showed Moses a tree to cut down and the water was made sweet when they needed food for the journey God provided food amen and gave them Angels food sure did amen sent quail and Mana from Heaven another time water out of a rock can you say Amen now watch I want you to look at this then 765 years later God is still out honoring the Passover now again the Passover is the blood of the Lamb King hez Hezekiah reinstated the ordinances of the Passover and the Lord honored the blood and the and the prayer look here at 2 Chronicles 30 and 17 for there were many in the congregation that were not Sanctified therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Passover for everyone that was not clean to sanctify them unto the Lord for a multitude of the people even many from Ephraim and and Manasseh and issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet they did eat the Passover otherwise than it was written but hezeki prayed for them saying the L the good Lord pardon everyone that prepareth his heart to seek God the Lord God of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary and the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and say it with me heal the people they didn't even have their life put together they were just coming out of bondage they had just paid for some sin they were just coming back in and trying to get things done right and they were not even according to the protocol that God had set forth under the law yeah Amen on but God honored the blood Hallelujah God honored the blood and he healed the people are you hearing me almost every time that brother brandham would officiate communion he would pray for the spiritual and physical strength for the journey here's another prayer here and proving his word 1965 he says Dear God tonight look down through the blood of your son Jesus who made the promise when these handkerchiefs are placed upon the sick bodies of the people may may The Eyes Of God look and may that sickness that devil be so scared and move away May the people keep the journey to the promised land with good health and strength as Israel marched through the Wilderness and there wasn't a feeble person among them at the other end may it be granted to these people father for we send these handkerchiefs in Jesus Christ's name Amen brother Brown Adam's prayer was always well they're getting old well we don't know know this prayer was Lord you done it for them under the old Covenant you can do it for this bride under the new come on I I what what what I'm what what I'm trying I'm not what I'm trying to tell you tonight we all know the we all know the scriptures on healing what I'm trying to tell you come at from this angle to get you to understand that God wants to heal his peopleall man Dr Moses had a chest full of medicine man have you ever thought about two million staying healthy brother Brandon would say now would you like to look into his Moses uh Medicine Chest to see what all he had the Bible gives it you know the Bible gives every spec of the medicine Moses had with him did you know that I'll show it to you in just a a moment amen now we're we're going to look over here in his medicine chest and see what Moses had now in Exodus all right let's look here here it is it's opened up I am the Lord thy God that Health thee he said that's every every prescription he had when someone says a baby was going to be born and the mother was in trouble I am the Lord thy God that Health thee if they had a man with something would happen put that one of his eyes I am the Lord that Health thee when a man fell and broke his leg I am the Lord that Health thee if one of the children had pneumonia I am the Lord thy God that Health thee Dr Moses what's on the menu for tonight what what's on the way tonight what's in the charter tonight we've got a baby down here Moses says I am the Lord thy God that Health thee pretty simple isn't it pretty simple but it's the simple thing sometimes that we Overlook amen now I'm the Lord that Health thee many of times Satan wants to tell us well you're the way you are and you've got this sickness on you because of some kind of a sin of your past you sinned and now you're paying well I don't know I don't know your past I don't have to know about your past but I can tell you that there's a blood Covenant that's pretty powerful that's true and I do know that when Kora had led a rebellion against Moses and those foolish people listened to his poison saying Moses you're not the only holy man and we're gifted like you and you know God speaks to us too there was a plague that fell upon the people and there were 14,700 people died of that plague but when Aaron ran out between and and stood between the living and the dead as the priest interceding for their healing the Bible says that God seen the intercessor and the plague stopped and the people were healed [Applause] amen now it's pretty it's pretty bad stuff whenever you're talking against the man of God it's pretty bad stuff and there's a lot of people that have died but I'm here to tell you the plague was stopped can you say Amen what about the brass serpent they're in number 16 amen if you were if you were to read there there were thousands of the children of Israel that were dying they were bit by serpents because of their sin am they were they were dying because of something that they were stupid they they they come against the plan of God again and serpents were dying were killing them but God provided healing for those Renegades those rebellious Israel people I'm going to tell you if the devil can make you think that well you're not good enough for healing if the devil can get you to thinking well you're you're you know you you you you've got you you sin or you you God knows what you done yesterday God knows what you had in your thought if he can keep you down he'll keep you under condemnation but remember as long as that blood atonement is for your sin you can believe for your healing Hallelujah now I'm not going to hold you too much longer here tonight but I want to I I I just I I I just want to lay this in hereen what did God do he came to Moses and said build a brass serpent amen and when Moses made a serpent of brass and he lift it up so that the people could see those who looked were healed of the snake bites the brass serpent me sin judge brass is Judgment man's serpent is sin it's no wonder that Christ says if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me when I'm lifted up oh glory to God Jesus hanging on Calvary took the penalty of sin he was that brass serpent he was sin judged he bear it all to the calvary When sin is judged penalty is paid and sickness is the result of the curse and when you can repent of your sins then you can believe God for your healing in the Old Testament there was an atonement made for leprosy amen come on you there're in Leviticus the 14th chapter you could you could find that a man that had leprosy he could come before the Tabernacle and God would heal him of leprosy we find in the 14th and 15th chapters that there were types of atonements made for the different healings God's interested in healing am I making that clear God's interested I don't care whether you're old whether you're young I don't care whether you have sinned I don't care I I don't care I don't care if you can look to the blood there's an atonement that is made for you every Old Testament atonement pointed to Calvary they were all types of the Cross and the blood of Jesus Christ now when Jesus came he stands in the synagogue and he declares Spirit of the Lord God is upon me Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverances I want you to catch that brokenhearted it's the spirit to preach Deliverance to the captives that's the soul and the recovering of the sight to the blind that's the body to set at Liberty them that are bruised spirit and soul to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now what was he doing now now now now stay with me I know I know it's hard on Wednesday night or on Sunday nights like this have we've been Sunday nights are long days and I know I'm putting a hole whole bunch of stuff in here but what was Jesus doing he was referring to the Old Testament Year of Jubilee so when Jesus was saying this here the old I I I've come to set the free and he says it's going to be Body Soul and Spirit that every man could return to his possession and that's the reason why he said to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now what was that accept cable year Leviticus 25:9 when thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement you shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all of your land and you shall Hollow that 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man into his possession and you shall return every man to his family now this was what Jesus was saying I've come to preach the acceptable Year of Jubilee that you can have your healing back you can have your sight back you can have your marriage back you can have your salvation back you can have it back if you'll accept it that's good it's yours for the taken that's right don't reason it here you've got to accept it yes amen am I laying it in there for you yes am I doing this in vain are you catching what I'm saying here tonight can you say Amen shall be a jubilee unto you it's no wonder when Jesus now watch watch watch what we talk about when Jesus says this day is this scripture fulfilled let's let's let's look and see what he says amen there in Matthews 8 and16 and when the evening was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were a sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our weakness the trumpet was to sound after an atonement was made the atonement was made and the sound of the trumpet and that's what I'm here for tonight I am blowing the gospel trumpet saying you're free you're healed if you can accept it you can have it it's yours I am blowing right here at New Life Church py Oklahoma that's good healing belongs to you because the lamb has paid the price that's right it don't matter whether you're young it don't matter whether you're old brother D was 91 and the he outlived the doctor that pronounced death on him well glory to God can you say Amen yes yes the bulock was slain the blood was sprinkled on The Mercy Seat now remember if there was no blood then there was uh then then it's a judgment seat amen without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin so if there's no blood it's a judgment seat but when you put the blood on the Judgment seat then it becomes The Mercy Seat it's the same seat it's the same seat Christ is not changing seats it's just going to be one day will be the Judgment seat but now it's The Mercy Seat the blood makes the difference that's right God can't be killing you and saving you at the same time it's God's desire to heal you that's right well glory to God now remember the Year of Jubilee was initiated by the blood of the Lamb amen then the trumpet sounded saying you are free every man can return to his possession it didn't matter if they had lost it 30 years earlier and they didn't nothing too far gone though it was a mess of their own making it does not matter these these people in the Year of Jubilee the reason why they become slaves is because they were slothful they they they didn't take care of good business but on that 50th year don't you come up like this I blew it but can I have my house back no no no no no no no it was the Year of Jubilee don't be looking to the past there was a lamb that was just saying that Year of Jubilee was the slang of the lamb and then the trumpet sounded every man can go back to his possession oh Church of God Amen we live in this condemnation the trumpet is sounding that there is nothing held against you you can go back to what God has given you at the beginning you can have healing you can have peace you can be delivered you can have it it's in the atonement amen praise the Lord no wonder no wonder they're in Isaiah the 7th chapter or or 52 and 7 try is it 752 try try 527 yeah how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that brings Good Tidings that publishes peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publishes salvation that sayth unto Zion thy God Reigns Apostle Paul picks it right back up in the New Testament and he says the preacher how beautiful are the feet of them that preaches this gospel the trumpet is blowing healing is yours it's not tomorrow you can have it today don't wait for it in the resurrection you can have healing T night amen sound the trumpet well brother window I just don't know oh God oh God I feel pretty Mighty right now I've sinned brother wend you don't know I've been wrong another the window I've blown it in the past and I know that I've blown it and I here I am I'm living in the regrets of my past but that's not what in Romans the 10th chapter tells us when the word that's the gospel trumpet was sounded amen and and and it says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and he goes down through it and if you go down to the 13th verse I believe it's it's Romans 10: 13 and it says and whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved Body Soul Spirit there you go salvation comes to the three salvation is not just the soul when you take care of the Soul it covers spirit and body whosoever believes whosoever receives shall be [Applause] saved Body Soul and Spirit to too old who put that back up say keys I'm too old whosoever shall call but my by my spleen or H H or my you know my my my kidneys or my my liver or or my my you know my you prostate or whatever you want to call it whosoever is there any whosoever's in the building are there any who whoevers whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved that's what the Jubilee trumpet is saying that's what Jesus was saying I am anointed to do this amen well glory to God what are we declaring tonight what am I declaring what is this message declaring this is the restoration of all things this is the rapture seizing and brother Bram says and God's been good he goes right back he goes right back Amen to the to to Malachi the 4th chapter and he says and they shall grow as calves in the stall he said see he the the the the the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings he said see the merciful god was is coming to bring healing to that rapturing Generation all right and they shall grow as calves in the star what was that's what this message of restoration is it's to prepare you for what is going we're not going to get worse we're going to get better we're not going to become Baggers we're going to be victorious we're going to leave this place healed we're going to leave this place delivered we're going to leave this place with victory in our soul I don't care what the devil says I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what your mind is telling you I don't care what your body is telling you if you can accept the atonement and the acceptable year of Jesus Christ you can have your salvation Body Soul Spirit that's right it's just that simple sin has been dealt with sin has taken care of the breach has been filled the breach is no longer there it's no longer God on this side and you on this side the blood has produced a bridge so that you can come and communicate with God having boldness Brethren CA now I don't remember see there it's in that's in Hebrews 10 boldness Brethren to come before the throne of grace hallelujah amen you remember that praise the Lord just tell me when you get that amen hallelujah what did the scripture says there're in uh uh okay there it is having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which has been consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his body and having a high priest over the house of of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water oh let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised not coming sheepishly I'm coming because he said to come Hallelujah this nonsense amen that Pentecostal denominational uh H H thing is we got too much of it in the message amen and Pentecost a preacher could hold things over your head all the time amen you aren't good enough because the preacher didn't think you was good enough the preacher is away from it the blood of Jesus Christ has paid the price for you your critic has nothing to say about you no one on earth has anything to say about you there's only one thing that matters and that's the blood of Jesus Christ that's what God does God brings you back to him you are Sons and Daughters of God condemnation will strike you the enemy but you're under a blood Covenant how dare any man Point his finger at you how dare any man put his finger to God's elect it is God that justifies what shall separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus now I'm an overcomer in all things don't care whether it's life or death it don't matter it don't matter to me I found my security in him he and he alone deserves any kind of say about me because he and he alone is the only one that shed his blood to redeem me denominations try to keep you under the thumb get out of that denominational thinking get out of the thumb the devil get out of the thumb of what a man thinks about you come under this anointed word because you are married to the living bloody bleeding lamb of Calvary he didn't just die for you he married you yeah he didn't just good point he didn't just say I'll put some blood and wash you up yeah he says I like you so well I want to make your M thank you Lord I wish I was twice my size so I could feel twice as good finally get to say what brother brandom said Hallelujah Hallelujah and I'm expanding daily oh yes he what is what is the preacher what is the preacher doing what am I doing today what do the men of God do when they're behind this Pulpit amen well here's the scripture that I had you look at a while ago amen uh you can put it back up there Romans 10 and 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how then shall they believe in him whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach or proclaim the gospel of peace and bring Good Tidings of good things the power of the atoning blood Gentiles you are Heathen of heathens but just as I showed the type of Ruth who was the monias who was the priest and their God of of of Baal I believe it was and though my words said that the Moab will be an enemy to me as long as they live yet I've Loved this girl named Ruth the moabitas come on come on she's not just a moabitas but she is the daughter of the priest the high man in the in the of the moabites and she comes over and God makes her a part of his lineage Hallelujah she had to get away from this and she had to go with this if she would have stayed there talking to Ruth saying I know I've done heard of what your God thinks about me I've done heard what they said what your God said about the moabites I don't I know what he said about me I'm not going over there they'll kill me but what she what she say she said your God shall be my God your people shall be my people where you live I live where you die I die I'm going and God says welcome to the fold welcome to the family you're mine and the blood covered over the blood covered over everything if he can cleanse leprosy he can cleanse you my spirit will be upon you and you'll re receive power to be my Witnesses and you will openly show this at atonement he says there in Luke 2448 behold I send the promise of my father but Harry into the city of Jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high now as I stop here now got to the church he knew Mom he knew that we were going to need healing God knew after the day of Pentecost that we were going to need healing now he provided it under the Old Testament the old it he provided it for Israel all through that time from the very beginning God slew a lamb for Adam and Eve and God was always providing an atonement but now what about our day God says I'm not going to leave you comfortless but I'm going to give gifts unto man and and and and he says there in 1 Corinthians 12:8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gift gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another discernment of spirits to another div diverse kinds of tongues to another interpretation of tongues this was all provided the atonement provided this for the church now too many people try to take that out but as long as I'm still in this Mortal body I I need I need those things those are God's gifts to the church that the blood paid for for us now brother Brandon says gifts plural of healing plural many gifts of healing he says you can be healed by love he says you can be healed by music he says you can be healed by doctors he says oh yes those are gifts given to the church however it comes God wants to bring healing bless the Lord Brother brandham tells the story in closing he he tells the story of the man was one of his sponsors in Topeka Kansas and he was a young preacher he said he was a boy a young preacher one of my first sponsors he said this Minister had gotten under had been pinned under under a roof or a wall mashed him down underneath it he said the young fellow was going to die his liver was bursted his spleen was knocked out of place tons fell on him I sat at breakfast talking to my wife and I said wife you know if Jesus was here you know what he'd do I said when he sponsored me I believed that word and he he was sponsoring Christ I said now that's a trick of the devil I said if Jesus was was here he'd go lay his holy hand upon him and the boy would get well I don't care if his liver has bursted he would get well because Jesus would walk in there knowing exactly what he who he was he knowed his calling the scripture was right vindicating in him that he knowed who he was not a Shadow of Doubt he'd lay his hands upon him and say son be well and then he'd walk out of there I said there isn't enough devils in hell to kill the boy then he would get well but I said you see honey he was Jesus the holy hands of God I said I'm a sinner I'm born sexual birth my father and mother were both Sinners I'm just a no good nothing and I said you but you know what if the Lord would give me a video vision and send me down there then that would be different I'd go down there and lay my hand on him and he'd come out of that bed if he'd give me a vision and then I got to thinking after all if it was the vision what was it it was the same dirty hands on him he says the same man praying for him the same dirty hands then I begin to think I'm his representative then God doesn't see me the blood of the righteous one lays upon that altar it makes intercession for me he is my sufficiency he is my prayer he is my life I said the only thing that makes me put my hands on him with faith is because I had the vision faith in the vision and without the vision the same Faith would do the same thing so I can reckon myself nothing but reckon him my all in all he's my life he's my commissioner no denomination sent me he sent me Hallelujah I go in his name I'll lay hands upon him I walked down there laid my hands on that boy and that night he was in the meeting solid and well oh yes he is that Fountain no other Fountain I know nothing but the blood of Jesus I'm a stinker I'm a renegade every one of us are but before God we are perfect be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how can you be because a perfect one represents us there that Fountain is there every day fresh not some stagnated something but the fresh
