[23:53] Thy Works where thou dwellest even where
[23:56] Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my

[24:02] in those days wherein Antipas was my
[24:05] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[24:08] where Satan dwelleth but I have a few
[24:10] things against thee because thou Hast
[24:13] them there that hold the doctrine of
[24:16] balum who taught Balo to cast a
[24:19] stumbling block before the children of
[24:21] Israel to eat things sacrificed and
[24:23] idols and to commit
[24:25] fornication so hast thou also them that
[24:28] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[24:31] thing I hate repent or else I will come
[24:35] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[24:38] them with the sword of my mouth he that
[24:42] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[24:44] says unto the churches to him that
[24:47] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[24:49] Hidden mana and will give him a white
[24:52] stone and in the stone a new name
[24:55] written which no man knoweth save he
[24:59] that receiveth it amen let's go to the
[25:02] Lord in prayer father we want to thank

[25:10] wonderful songs of Zion Lord and giving
[25:13] us a a a a song of testimony in our
[25:17] heart Lord to sing those songs with
[25:20] conviction and Zeal father we thank you
[25:23] for the love that you have given us Lord
[25:26] we thank you for the revelation of of
[25:28] your book The Revelation Lord in this
[25:31] last day father for we know that the
[25:34] unveiling of your word is the unveiling
[25:37] of the bride and we love you for it
[25:40] father now we just ask that you would
[25:42] help us Lord as we read tonight and and
[25:45] ask Lord that your uh spirit would be
[25:48] with us and we'll give you glory and
[25:51] honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[25:53] Christ can the church say
[25:56] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[26:00] seated we um so uh for for um sister Zoe
[26:05] and and um and brother Josiah you we we
[26:08] don't really preach uh not going to be
[26:11] preaching tonight but um we're going to
[26:14] read in the church age book and and how
[26:17] many brought your church age books amen
[26:21] and uh actually I've got I um um tell
[26:25] you what praise the Lord um
[26:29] would you run in my in my office and get
[26:31] a church age book it's it's right there
[26:33] on my desk uh all the way over than that
[26:36] four far uh you'll see it it's in a
[26:39] stack amen and so um we're going to
[26:42] start at page
[26:44] 158 and
[26:47] um man I love I love the church age book
[26:51] now we so we we've got to remember now
[26:55] that the um um
[26:59] what God is doing it's the
[27:01] unveiling of the Mysteries so this these
[27:04] seven Church ages seven um oh you've got
[27:08] a book back here well you got an extra
[27:09] one here too if you want to if you want
[27:11] to read that there amen that's only
[27:18] $50 okay all right so you don't anyone
[27:21] else need a church age
[27:22] book Hallelujah
[27:29] so
[27:31] um so we we um uh the unveiling the the
[27:37] the the whole purpose of the um of the
[27:42] prophet's message was was to Amen to um
[27:47] bring us a message it was the opening of
[27:50] the seals the unveiling of the um the
[27:54] unscrambling of the of the Mysteries
[27:57] that uh um that have been hid in the
[28:00] Book of Revelations and so that is that
[28:04] is the very specific purpose uh that God
[28:08] brought to us so remember amen it was
[28:11] the um the the seven Thunders being
[28:15] interpreted and to turning our hearts
[28:18] back to the apostolic fathers so and so
[28:22] we appreciate this I um I I think that
[28:26] we should take this very seriously not
[28:27] just uh having these on Wednesday night
[28:30] but read your church age book study this
[28:32] thing because there's there's so much in
[28:35] that and when we do it do it prayerfully
[28:38] because I do believe that that there is
[28:41] a specific purpose that that the Lord is
[28:43] trying to show to us he's showing us two
[28:47] things here now amen uh is showing us
[28:51] the the the apostate church but it's
[28:55] also positioning the bride of Jesus
[28:59] Christ positioning you where you belong
[29:02] and so uh we we we want to to to really
[29:07] understand that this is not just
[29:09] Doctrine but God is showing us who we
[29:12] are amen and how to to bypass a lot of
[29:16] the
[29:17] nonsense uh that that there is in Leona
[29:21] amen and so we want to keep that in mind
[29:24] let's let's start here in in um uh one
[29:28] page
[29:29] 158 and um amen we're going to uh
[29:34] actually we just read that entire uh
[29:37] thing there so let's go ahead and go
[29:39] down here to uh to the pergamus
[29:42] paragraph it says uh pergamum ancient
[29:46] name was situated in uh
[29:49] Mia uh in a district watered by Three
[29:52] Rivers by one of which is communicated
[29:56] to uh to the Sea
[29:58] it was described as the most illustrious
[30:00] City in Asia it was the city of uh it
[30:05] was the city of culture with a library
[30:07] second only to that in
[30:10] Alexandria but it but yet it was a city
[30:12] of great sin given over to uh lenus
[30:17] rights of the worship of something whom
[30:22] they worshiped in the form of a living
[30:24] serpent uh which housed and fed the
[30:27] temple in this beautiful Cent city of
[30:30] integrated Groves and public walks and
[30:34] parks and lived a small group of
[30:37] dedicated believers who were not fooled
[30:39] by the veneer of Beauty and uphor the
[30:42] satanic worship that filled the
[30:46] place the per uh the pergam age lasted
[30:50] about 300 years from
[30:54] 312 to 606 ad
[30:58] using our god-given rule for choosing
[31:00] the messenger to each age that is we
[31:05] choose the one whose Ministry most uh
[31:08] closely approximates that of the first
[31:11] messenger Paul we
[31:14] unhesitatingly declare the pergan
[31:17] messenger to be Martin Martin was born
[31:20] in 3155 in Hungary however his life work
[31:24] was in France where he labored in and
[31:28] around tours as a bishop he died in
[31:32] 399 this great Saint was the uncle of
[31:36] another wonderful Christian St Patrick
[31:39] of Ireland Martin was converted to
[31:41] Christ while he was following a career
[31:45] as a professional Soldier it was while
[31:47] he still engaged in this occupation that
[31:51] the uh that a most remarkable Miracle
[31:53] occurred it is recorded that a beggar
[31:56] lay sick in the street
[31:58] of the town where Martin was posted the
[32:01] winter cold was more than he could bear
[32:04] for he was poorly clad no one paid any
[32:07] attention to his needs until Martin came
[32:09] by seeing this poor man's plight but not
[32:13] having an extra garment he took off his
[32:16] outer cloak and cut it into two with his
[32:19] sword and wrapped the clock the cloth
[32:22] around the freezing man he attended him
[32:25] the best he could and went on his way
[32:28] that night the Lord Jesus appeared unto
[32:30] him in a vision and there he stood like
[32:33] a beggar wrapped in the half of Martin's
[32:36] garment he spoke to him and said Martin
[32:40] though he is only a Catan he has uh uh
[32:45] he is only a kman hath clothed me with
[32:48] this garment from that time on Martin
[32:52] sought to serve the Lord with all his
[32:55] heart his life become a series of of
[32:58] Miracles manifesting the power of God
[33:02] after having left the Army and having
[33:04] become a leader in the church he took a
[33:07] very militant stand against
[33:09] idolatry he he cut down the Groves broke
[33:13] up the images pulled down the altars
[33:16] when confronted by the pagans for his
[33:18] deeds he challenged them much the same
[33:22] manner that Elijah did the prophets of
[33:24] Baal he offered to be tied to a tree
[33:28] on its Underside so that when it was cut
[33:31] down it would crush him unless God
[33:34] intervened and turn the tree around
[33:37] while it fell the Wy
[33:40] Heathen uh tied him to a tree that was
[33:43] growing on the side of a hill assured
[33:46] the natural pull of gravity would cause
[33:49] the tree to fall as to crush him and
[33:52] just as the tree began to fall God swung
[33:55] it around and Uphill contrary to all the
[33:58] natural laws and the Fe fleeing Heathen
[34:01] were crushed as the tree fell on several
[34:04] of them historians acknowledge that on
[34:08] at least three occasions he raised the
[34:11] dead by faith in jesus' name in one
[34:14] instance he prayed for a dead baby like
[34:17] Elisha he laid himself on the babe and
[34:22] prayed and it come back to life and
[34:24] health on another occasion he was called
[34:27] to help deliver a brother who was being
[34:29] carried away to his death in a time of
[34:32] great uh persecution by the time he
[34:36] arrived the poor man was already dead he
[34:39] had hang they had hanged him on on a
[34:40] tree his body was lifeless and his eyes
[34:43] protruded from the sockets but Martin
[34:46] took him down and when he prayed the man
[34:48] was restored to life and to his
[34:50] rejoicing family Martin never did fear
[34:54] the enemy regardless of who it was thus
[34:57] he went to personally face a wicked
[34:59] Emperor who was responsible for the
[35:02] death of many Spirit-filled
[35:05] Saints the emperor would not Grant an
[35:08] audience so Martin went to a friend of
[35:11] the emperor one damasus a cruel Bishop
[35:15] of Rome but the bishop being a nominal
[35:18] Christian of the false Vine would not
[35:20] intercede Martin went back to the Palace
[35:24] but by now the gates had been locked and
[35:26] they would not allow him to Enter he
[35:29] laid down on his face before the Lord
[35:31] and prayed that he is able that that he
[35:34] be able to get into the palace he heard
[35:37] a voice bidding him arise and when he
[35:40] did so he saw the gates open of their
[35:43] own accord he walked into the court but
[35:46] the Arrogant ruler would not turn his
[35:48] head and speak to him Martin again
[35:51] prayed and suddenly a fire came
[35:54] spontaneously from the seat of the
[35:57] throne and the unhappy Emperor vacated
[36:01] speedily surely the Lord humbles the
[36:03] proud and exalts the lowly isn't that
[36:07] something such was his ardor in serving
[36:10] the lord that the devil was mightily
[36:12] aroused the enemy of Truth hired
[36:15] assassins to kill Martin they came by
[36:18] stealth to his home as they were about
[36:20] to kill him he stood erect and bared his
[36:23] throat to the sword and as they leaped
[36:25] forward the power of God suddenly hurled
[36:28] them back across the room so overcome
[36:31] were they in that Holy and fearful
[36:34] atmosphere that they crawled upon their
[36:36] hands and knees and begged forgiveness
[36:38] for the attempt upon his life too often
[36:42] when men are signally used of the Lord
[36:45] they become lifted up with pride but not
[36:47] so with Martin he even remained
[36:51] humble uh he ever remained humble
[36:53] servant of God one night as he was
[36:56] preparing to enter into to the pull pit
[36:58] a beggar came to a study and asked for
[37:01] some clothing Martin referred the beggar
[37:04] to his head Deacon and the hottie Deacon
[37:06] commanded him to leave thereupon he went
[37:09] back to see Martin and Martin arose and
[37:12] gave the beggar his own fine robe and
[37:15] bade the Deacon bring him another robe
[37:17] which was of lesser quality that night
[37:20] as Martin preached the word the flock
[37:23] the flock of God saw a soft white glow
[37:27] of light around his
[37:29] person surely this was a great man a
[37:33] true Messenger to that age never
[37:36] desirous of ought but to please God he
[37:39] lived a most consecrated life never
[37:42] could he be induced to preach until he
[37:45] had prayed or first prayed and was in
[37:48] such spiritual frame as to know and
[37:50] delivered the full counsel of God by the
[37:52] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven often
[37:55] he would keep the people waiting while
[37:57] he prayed for full Assurance just to
[38:00] know about Martin and his mighty
[38:02] Ministry might make one think that the
[38:05] persecution of the Saints had invaded
[38:07] not so they were still being destroyed
[38:10] by the devil through the instrumentality
[38:12] of the
[38:14] wicked they were burned at the state
[38:16] they were nailed to logs face down and
[38:18] wild dogs were turned loose on them so
[38:21] that the dogs would tear away the Flesh
[38:23] and the bounds leaving the victims to
[38:25] die a terrible torture in terrible
[38:28] torture babes were ripped from expectant
[38:31] mothers and thrown to the Hogs women's
[38:33] breasts were cut off and they were
[38:35] forced to stand erect while each
[38:37] heartthrob poured out the blood until
[38:39] they crumpled in death the tragedy was
[38:43] even greater to think about when one
[38:45] realizes that this was not solely the
[38:47] work of a heathen but many times it was
[38:50] caused by so-called Christians who felt
[38:53] that they did God a favor in
[38:55] Exterminating these loyal so soldiers of
[38:57] the Cross who stood for the word in
[39:00] obedience to the Holy Spirit John 16:2
[39:04] they shall put you out of the synagogue
[39:07] yay the time cometh that whosoever kth
[39:10] you will think that he doeth God a
[39:12] service Matthew 24:9 and they shall
[39:16] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[39:19] kill you and you shall be hated of all
[39:22] Nations for my name's sake by signs and
[39:25] wonders by the power of the spirit
[39:28] Martin was truly Vindicated as the
[39:31] messenger to the age but not only was he
[39:34] gifted by great ministry he himself was
[39:38] forever true to the word of God he
[39:41] fought organization he withstood sin in
[39:44] high places he championed the truth in
[39:47] word and deed and lived out a full life
[39:50] of Christian Victory a biographer wrote
[39:53] of him on this wise no one ever saw him
[39:57] angry Disturbed grieving or laughing he
[40:01] was always one and the same and seemed
[40:04] something behind or Beyond mortal
[40:07] wearing his
[40:08] countenance a sort of celestial Joy
[40:12] never was anything on his lips but
[40:14] Christ never anything in his heart but
[40:16] piety peace and pity often did he weep
[40:20] for the sins even of those his
[40:23] distractors who when he was quiet and
[40:26] absent attacked attacked
[40:28] him with viperous lips and poison tongue
[40:32] many hated him for virtues they
[40:34] themselves did not possess and could not
[40:37] imitate and alas his bitterest ass
[40:41] salant were
[40:43] Bishops so that's quite a that's quite a
[40:45] testimony to to this uh Third Church age
[40:50] messenger now and and and you've got to
[40:52] remember now amen the word came to that
[40:57] messenger for that age so so the the um
[41:03] amen God raised these men up amen these
[41:06] were specially built men these were men
[41:08] that God raised up and anointed to bring
[41:14] the word to that Generation Now there
[41:16] were now this is not especially in this
[41:19] age here uh there's there's others that
[41:23] that thought it should be somebody else
[41:25] uh as as uh should be the messenger amen
[41:29] but the prophet God God through the
[41:32] inspiration uh brought the prophet to
[41:35] the um amen uh to this understanding
[41:39] here and remember when the angel of the
[41:41] Lord when he was through preaching these
[41:44] seven Church ages that the that the
[41:46] pillar of fire left brother brandham and
[41:49] went over there to the to the side of
[41:51] the building or the back of the building
[41:53] there and and literally amen done the
[41:56] seven uh the seven candlesticks and the
[41:59] way that brother brandham has wrote in
[42:00] your church age uh or has put here he
[42:04] had that on the on the chalkboard and
[42:07] the pillar of fire came and displayed
[42:10] the entire thing just like brother
[42:12] brandham had it which gives you and I an
[42:15] assurance amen that God knew what he was
[42:18] doing amen and of course we know we know
[42:22] what what was uh taking place amen we
[42:25] can readily accept because we're looking
[42:27] back 50 years and we can see the full
[42:29] scope of things just like believing in
[42:31] Jesus amen we can look back at but but
[42:34] back in that in that day you had to
[42:37] accept that prophet's message you had to
[42:41] believe it amen and so uh and so I I
[42:45] think we're just we're so it's so
[42:49] beautiful um Amen to see how all of this
[42:52] comes together amen and I've always
[42:55] loved the the writings and the and and
[42:58] and this the life of uh Martin St Martin
[43:01] because he is truly an incredible an
[43:04] incredible man now we're going to go to
[43:06] the
[43:07] salutation and um and so uh we're in
[43:10] page 162 we're going to start there at
[43:12] the first
[43:13] paragraph amen and um we're going to
[43:17] he's going to start dealing with the
[43:18] deity now at at the at the beginning of
[43:21] each one of these Church ages amen you
[43:24] will notice that Jesus is is referring
[43:28] himself he is he he's going back showing
[43:31] that he is he is almighty God Amen now
[43:37] you you remember the first age there in
[43:39] in in Revelations 2 and 1 amen it says
[43:43] he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his
[43:45] right hand who walketh in the midst of
[43:47] the seven candlesticks and then you go
[43:49] down to the eth verse there the samon uh
[43:52] it says these things sayith the first
[43:55] and the last which was dead and is alive
[43:58] you go on down to the 12th verse these
[44:01] things saith he which hath a sharp sword
[44:05] with the two edges every time that he is
[44:08] he is revealing himself to another age
[44:11] the beginning of that age he always
[44:14] establishes that he and he alone is God
[44:19] Amen he and he alone now you've got to
[44:23] understand there's where Satan was going
[44:25] to fight he was going to fight against
[44:28] God and the godhead amen they were going
[44:31] to introduce the three gods they were
[44:32] going to introduce um the prayers to the
[44:35] Saints they were going to introduce
[44:36] these saint but all through every age
[44:39] God comes back and he and and he's and
[44:42] he's saying Jesus comes back and saying
[44:45] I am God I am all God there's not one
[44:49] there's not two there's not three
[44:51] there's not five amen and it's
[44:53] incredible because Hallelujah you would
[44:56] think this you would think the folks in
[44:57] our in our message amen uh would have
[45:01] that clear cuz brother brandham preached
[45:03] it pretty clearly and uh but yet there's
[45:06] still some that's that believes in two
[45:08] and there's this and there's that I want
[45:09] to tell you there's only one God and he
[45:13] lives in the body of Jesus
[45:15] Christ can you say Amen all right and so
[45:19] and and and as we go now you remember
[45:22] and we're going to get into this here in
[45:23] a minute as as we read listen there's a
[45:26] re reason why we stay with what the word
[45:29] says we're not we're not interested in
[45:31] what someone else says necessarily amen
[45:35] uh though we want to Rejoice uh with
[45:38] other people's revelation of the word
[45:40] the word is our absolute the word is
[45:43] where we came from and so we we should
[45:46] never never be swayed one way or the
[45:48] other you know uh um well well this good
[45:51] preacher or this good personal there's a
[45:53] lot of wonderful personalities and and
[45:56] that could Le you from the word we don't
[45:59] want to be led astray from the word by
[46:01] any kind of a personality we stay with
[46:04] the word because that's who we are is
[46:08] the word can you say Amen now amen let's
[46:11] let's start Revelations um oh there in
[46:14] the
[46:15] salutation it says Revelations 2 and2 B
[46:19] these things saith he which hath a sharp
[46:21] sharp sword with two edges the message
[46:24] to the church the Third Church age is
[46:27] about to come
[46:28] forth
[46:31] um the the third scene of this unfolding
[46:34] drama of Christ in the midst of his
[46:36] church is about to be revealed with
[46:39] trumpet-like voice the spirit presents
[46:43] the matchless one he which hath the
[46:46] sharp sword with two edges how vastly
[46:49] different is this presentation from the
[46:52] time when pilate introduced the Lamb of
[46:54] God clothed in mocking Robes of purple
[46:58] and smitten and Thorn crowned saying
[47:01] behold your king now Regal robed and
[47:05] crowned with uh with Glory stands the
[47:09] Risen Lord Christ the power of
[47:12] God in these words he which hath the
[47:16] sharp sword with two edges lies another
[47:19] revelation of the godhead in the physan
[47:22] age you will recall he was set forth as
[47:25] the unchanging God in the Samaran age we
[47:28] saw him as the one true God and beside
[47:31] him there was no other now in the pergam
[47:34] Manan
[47:35] age there is a further revelation of his
[47:38] godhead set forth by the Association his
[47:42] association with a sharp two-edged sword
[47:44] which is the word of God Hebrews 4:12
[47:48] for the word of God is quick and
[47:50] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[47:53] sword piercing even to the dividing of
[47:56] sunder of soul and spirit and of the
[47:58] joints and moral and as a discerner of
[48:01] the thought and the intents of the heart
[48:03] Ephesians 6:1 17 take the sword of the
[48:07] spirit which is the word of God
[48:10] Revelations 9 or 19 and 13th and 15th
[48:14] verse he was clothed with a vesture
[48:17] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[48:19] the word of God and out of his mouth
[48:22] goeth a sharp two-edged sword John 1 1
[48:27] through3 in the beginning was the word
[48:29] the word was with God the Word was God
[48:33] the same word was in the beginning with
[48:35] God all things were made by him and
[48:38] without him was not anything made which
[48:40] was made 1 John 5:7 there are three that
[48:44] bear record in heaven the Father the
[48:47] word and the Holy Ghost and these three
[48:50] are
[48:51] one now we can see his association with
[48:54] the word he is the word
[48:57] he uh uh that is who he is the word in
[49:01] his name there in uh John 1 and one
[49:05] where it says in the beginning was the
[49:07] word the root from which we get our
[49:10] translation for word is logos which
[49:14] means the thought or concept it has the
[49:17] double meaning of thought and speech now
[49:20] a thought ex expressed is a word or
[49:23] words isn't that wonderful and beautiful
[49:27] John says the concept of God was
[49:29] expressed in Jesus I love that the
[49:32] concept of God was expressed in Jesus
[49:37] you want to know what God is thinking
[49:41] all you have to do is look at Jesus
[49:43] Christ he is the heartbeat the very
[49:47] expression of God it says now John says
[49:50] the concept of God was expressed in
[49:52] Jesus Paul says the very same thing in
[49:55] Hebrews 1 1 through3 God who at soundry
[49:59] times and in diverse manners spake in
[50:02] times past unto the fathers by the
[50:04] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[50:07] unto us by his son logos whom he hath
[50:10] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[50:12] also he made the worlds who being the
[50:15] brightness of his glory the express
[50:17] image of his person and upholding All
[50:19] Things by the power of His word when he
[50:22] had by himself purged our sins sat down
[50:25] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[50:27] God become expressed in the person of
[50:31] Jesus Christ Jesus was the
[50:35] express image of God again John 1:14 the
[50:40] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[50:43] the very substance of God was flesh and
[50:48] dwelt Among Us now you now brother Bram
[50:51] is not missing any points here he's
[50:52] trying to tell us there's don't don't
[50:55] don't try to get it all mixed up
[50:57] the creation of that body was so that
[51:00] the god of Glory could live in that
[51:04] flesh amen we don't we're not we we we
[51:08] don't need no other Revelation to try to
[51:10] to try to make it anything different we
[51:13] it is it the mystery is God in flesh
[51:18] don't mess with that can you say Amen
[51:21] then through that flesh that sinless
[51:24] body of Jesus Christ he paid the price
[51:27] God shed his own blood so to redeem you
[51:33] who is the word in a fallen body
[51:37] hallelujah amen he's he's here to bring
[51:41] many sons back to Glory now watch he
[51:45] says the very substance of God was made
[51:47] flesh and dwelt Among Us the great
[51:49] spirit God unto which no man could
[51:52] approach which no man had seen or could
[51:55] behold was now tabernacled in flesh and
[51:59] dwelt among men expressing the fullness
[52:02] of God to men John 1:18 no man hath seen
[52:06] God at any time the only begotten son
[52:09] which is in the bosom of the father he
[52:11] hath declared him God who on occasions
[52:14] would manifest his presence by the
[52:16] pillar of fire cloud and the or Pillar
[52:18] of Fire that struck fear in the hearts
[52:21] of men this God whose heart
[52:24] characteristics were made known only by
[52:26] revelation of words through the prophets
[52:29] now became Emanuel God With Us declaring
[52:33] himself the word declare is to is taken
[52:37] from the Greek
[52:38] root which we often interpret as exist
[52:42] which um means to thoroughly explain and
[52:45] to make clear that is what the Living
[52:48] Word Jesus did he brought God to us for
[52:52] he was God he revealed God to us with
[52:56] such perfect clarity that God could say
[52:59] uh that God could say about him in 1
[53:02] John 1 1-3 that which was from the
[53:05] beginning which we have heard logos
[53:07] means speech which we have seen with our
[53:10] eyes which we have looked upon in our
[53:12] hands of handled of the word of life for
[53:15] the life was manifested and we seen it
[53:19] and bear witness and show unto you that
[53:22] eternal life which was with the father
[53:25] and was manif man ested unto us that
[53:28] which we have seen and heard declare we
[53:31] unto you that you also may have
[53:35] fellowship with us truly our fellowship
[53:38] is with the father and with his son
[53:40] Jesus Christ when God was truly revealed
[53:44] he was manifested in the flesh he that
[53:47] ha seen me hath seen the
[53:49] father now back to Hebrews 1 1 and 3 we
[53:54] made note that Jesus was was the
[53:56] expressed image of God he was God
[53:59] expressing himself in man to man there
[54:02] is something else to note in this in
[54:05] these very verses in these verses
[54:07] especially verses one and two God who at
[54:11] sunry times and in diverse manners spake
[54:15] in time past unto the fathers by the
[54:18] prophets and hath in these last days
[54:20] spoken unto us by his son I want you to
[54:23] notice here in the margin of your Bible
[54:25] you will see a correction
[54:27] the word by is not a correct translation
[54:30] it should be in not by it then reads
[54:34] correctly God in times P spoke unto the
[54:37] fathers in the prophets by means of the
[54:40] word first Samuel 3 and 21b for the Lord
[54:44] revealed himself to Samuel and Shiloh by
[54:47] the word of the Lord that brings out 1
[54:50] John 5: 7 perfectly the spirit and word
[54:55] are one
[54:57] Jesus revealed the Father the word
[54:59] revealed the father Jesus was the Living
[55:02] Word praise God today he is still that
[55:06] Living Word can I hear an amen aren't
[55:10] you glad for that Living Word I love it
[55:13] I love it amen now remember uh who you
[55:17] are amen when you receive the Holy Ghost
[55:19] what does that do it falls upon the
[55:21] genetics of God on the inside of you you
[55:24] become that Living Word as well
[55:26] amen you were in Christ it says now when
[55:29] Jesus was upon the Earth he said believe
[55:32] thou not that I'm in the father and the
[55:34] father in me the words that I speak unto
[55:37] you I speak not of myself but the father
[55:40] that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works
[55:42] John 14:10 here it is most EV evidently
[55:46] set forth that the perfect manifestation
[55:49] of God in the sun was by the indwelling
[55:52] spirit manifesting in word and works
[55:55] that is exact exactly what we have been
[55:57] teaching all along and when the bride
[56:00] will get back to being a word bride she
[56:03] will produce the very works that Jesus
[56:06] produced the word is God the spirit is
[56:09] God they are all one one cannot work
[56:13] apart from the other if one truly has
[56:15] the spirit of God he will have the word
[56:18] of God that is how it was with the
[56:21] prophets they had the indwelling spirit
[56:23] of God and the word came to them that is
[56:26] how it was with Jesus in him was the
[56:29] spirit without measure and the word came
[56:32] to him Jesus began both to do and to
[56:36] teach my Doctrine is not my own but the
[56:39] father that sent me acts 1 and one and
[56:41] John 7 and 16 remember now John the
[56:45] Baptist was both prophet and the
[56:47] messenger of his day he was filling or
[56:51] he was filled with the holy ghost from
[56:52] his mother's
[56:53] womb and when he was baptized in the
[56:56] Jordan the word of God Jesus came to him
[57:00] the word always comes to the true Spirit
[57:02] field that is the evidence of being
[57:05] filled with the Holy Ghost that is what
[57:08] Jesus said would be the evidence he said
[57:12] I will pray the father and he will send
[57:15] you another comforter that he may abide
[57:18] with you forever and even the spirit of
[57:21] Truth whom the world cannot receive now
[57:24] we know what what the truth is
[57:27] Thy word is truth John
[57:30] 1717b again in John
[57:32] 843 why do you not understand my speech
[57:36] even because you cannot hear my word did
[57:39] you notice that Jesus said that the
[57:41] world could not receive the Holy Ghost
[57:45] well in this verse I just read neither
[57:47] could they receive the word because the
[57:50] spirit and the word are one if you have
[57:55] the Holy Ghost as the prophets the word
[57:58] would come to you I think this is just
[58:00] this this here should be a a underlined
[58:04] very well amen when you have the true
[58:08] Spirit the true word will always come to
[58:14] you you'll never be satisfied with the
[58:17] status quo you'll never be satisfied
[58:20] with the man's interpretation you want
[58:23] that spirit of God within you want that
[58:26] word because that's who you are that's
[58:30] what you are you want that more than
[58:32] emotions emotions are wonderful amen you
[58:35] want that more than than gifts gifts are
[58:38] wonderful you want that more than the
[58:41] than than than uh uh you know wonderful
[58:45] blessings of God throughout the church
[58:47] service those are wonderful but you want
[58:50] the word and you want the anointing upon
[58:54] that word in your life that's what we
[58:57] strive for I'm not talking about a dead
[59:00] letter Jesus was the Living Word and if
[59:03] you are the seed of God and you've got
[59:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will
[59:08] be the Living Word it won't be a dead
[59:10] letter from a dead Prophet uh uh a long
[59:14] time ago it'll be a living word that is
[59:17] still the prophet's gone he was just the
[59:21] vessel in whom the word came to you you
[59:27] receiving that Living Word take on that
[59:30] life within you and that's what makes
[59:33] you who you are can you say amen amen he
[59:37] says he says now um uh amen he uh he
[59:41] says I let's see where did I where did I
[59:44] just stop he says did you ever notice
[59:46] that Jesus uh that said that the world
[59:48] could not receive the Holy Ghost well in
[59:50] this verse I just read neither could
[59:53] they receive the word why because the
[59:55] spirit and the the word are one if you
[59:57] have the Holy Spirit as the prophets the
[1:00:00] word would come to you you would receive
[1:00:03] it in John 14:26 but the comforter which
[1:00:07] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[1:00:10] send in my name shall teach you all
[1:00:12] things and bring all things to your
[1:00:15] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:00:18] you uh uh said unto you here again we
[1:00:22] find the word coming because of the
[1:00:25] spirit of God
[1:00:26] again in John 16 and13 how be it when he
[1:00:29] the spirit of Truth word is come he will
[1:00:33] guide you into all truth Thy word is
[1:00:36] truth he shall not speak of himself but
[1:00:40] whatsoever he shall hear the word of God
[1:00:43] that shall he speak the word he will
[1:00:46] show you things to come Spirit bringing
[1:00:48] the word of Prophecy I want you to note
[1:00:51] very carefully that Jesus did not say
[1:00:53] that the evidence of being baptized was
[1:00:56] the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[1:00:58] interpreting prophesying shouting and
[1:01:00] dancing he said the evidence would be um
[1:01:04] that you would be in the truth you would
[1:01:08] be in the word of God for your age
[1:01:11] evidence has to do with receiving that
[1:01:15] word can you say Amen now it's not just
[1:01:18] amen but it's receiving that word what
[1:01:20] what what does it what does it mean by
[1:01:21] receiving that word that means you're
[1:01:23] coming under the authority of the word
[1:01:26] not just saying God sent a prophet not
[1:01:29] just saying we're living in the you know
[1:01:31] we understand the Mysteries that's not
[1:01:33] it coming under the authority of that
[1:01:37] word that means when your flesh is
[1:01:40] wanting to do something contrary you're
[1:01:42] going to say no we're going to bring it
[1:01:45] under the authority of the word it's not
[1:01:50] word this is not in in in in in uh uh
[1:01:55] just word only but this is that Living
[1:01:59] Word in me taking
[1:02:02] preeminence and
[1:02:04] authority over the over the Bride of
[1:02:07] Jesus Christ can you say Amen now if you
[1:02:10] don't want to come under the authority
[1:02:12] of a husband don't get married amen if
[1:02:16] you don't want it hallelujah it's
[1:02:18] awkward these days when I'm when I'm
[1:02:20] when I'm when I'm marrying and and and
[1:02:22] bringing the bringing the um the old you
[1:02:26] know are you uh will you obey him will
[1:02:28] you love and Obey him as long as oh I
[1:02:32] find myself even even sort of these days
[1:02:36] because it's the spirit of the age and
[1:02:40] and and probably only the message
[1:02:43] Believers are the only one that still
[1:02:44] puts that uh part in the in the ceremony
[1:02:47] I mean they've taken that totally
[1:02:51] out amen feminism is rampant feminism is
[1:02:57] of the devil feminism is wrong you don't
[1:03:02] jump in your husband's face and you sure
[1:03:05] don't jump in God's face whatever his
[1:03:08] word teaches you say I surrender my
[1:03:13] rights to you the
[1:03:15] word that's who we are don't call
[1:03:18] yourself a Christian don't say I'm the
[1:03:22] bride of Christ and refuse that word
[1:03:26] when it's coming your
[1:03:28] way so that's what brother Brandon was
[1:03:30] saying amen once again he said the
[1:03:33] evidence would be that you would be in
[1:03:37] the truth you would be in the word for
[1:03:40] your age evidence has to do with
[1:03:43] receiving that word so how many
[1:03:46] understands that so it's not just in
[1:03:47] letter form but it's coming under the
[1:03:51] spirit of that word amen so that's what
[1:03:54] we all want every one of us and and we
[1:03:57] can't just now remember husbands wives
[1:04:00] boys girls we are all in the category of
[1:04:04] the bride of Christ amen we all have to
[1:04:08] surrender our Wills to that word amen so
[1:04:12] in in 1 Corinthians
[1:04:15] 14-37 If any man thinkk him and he's
[1:04:17] going to show himself now if any man
[1:04:19] think him to be a prophet or spiritual
[1:04:23] let him acknowledge
[1:04:26] that the things I write unto you are the
[1:04:30] Commandments of the Lord now see that
[1:04:34] the proof of the indwelling spirit was
[1:04:37] to acknowledge and follow that is
[1:04:41] capital f o l l o w so not just
[1:04:47] acknowledging but following the word
[1:04:51] friends we cannot be Christians in word
[1:04:56] only it's got to be a part of our
[1:04:59] everyday
[1:05:01] life you say well I just have a hard
[1:05:04] time get the Holy Ghost you get the Holy
[1:05:07] Ghost it's him living his life through
[1:05:11] you oh Hallelujah I tell you what I
[1:05:15] don't I don't want to be just a I don't
[1:05:17] want to be one of these guys that's just
[1:05:18] halfway in and half way out either I'm
[1:05:20] going to be a full Christian or I don't
[1:05:22] want to be
[1:05:23] one I don't want to be Miss isable I
[1:05:26] want whatever that word says to me amen
[1:05:29] if you're a woman to your husb uh a wife
[1:05:32] to your husband amen don't you want to
[1:05:34] be everything that you're that that
[1:05:36] God's called you to be if you're a
[1:05:38] husband to your wife don't you want to
[1:05:40] be everything God wants you to be if you
[1:05:42] are the Bride of Jesus Christ don't you
[1:05:45] want to be everything that he has
[1:05:48] purposed for you to be I want to be
[1:05:52] everything amen without any kind of
[1:05:54] reservations amen that's what I want now
[1:05:57] all right he says the proof of the
[1:06:00] indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and
[1:06:03] follow what the prophet gave for his age
[1:06:06] as he set uh the church in order Paul
[1:06:10] had to say to those who claimed another
[1:06:12] Revelation in verse 36 what came the
[1:06:16] word of God out from you or came it unto
[1:06:19] you only the evidence of a Spirit-filled
[1:06:22] Christian believer is not to produce
[1:06:25] truth word but to receive the truth word
[1:06:31] to believe and Obey it can you say Amen
[1:06:35] so it's not it's not that you are a
[1:06:37] prophet saying well this is my
[1:06:39] Revelation or this is what I think no no
[1:06:41] words already come so we don't produce
[1:06:43] any truth we simply accept it and Obey
[1:06:49] it and when we come under the headship
[1:06:52] the Glorious thing about coming under
[1:06:54] the headship of Christ is we receive all
[1:06:58] of the blessings that come from that
[1:07:00] headship we receive all of everything
[1:07:04] that Christ all the deity all the power
[1:07:07] that he has is now trickled down not
[1:07:11] trickled that but we're under the
[1:07:13] umbrella of that glory to the
[1:07:16] church amen now
[1:07:22] uh okay so um it says have you know
[1:07:25] noticed in Revelations 22:17 that the
[1:07:28] spirit and the bride say come let him
[1:07:31] that heareth say come see the bride
[1:07:34] speaks the same thing as does the spirit
[1:07:38] she is a word bride proving she has the
[1:07:43] spirit amen now now
[1:07:46] again we're we're we're paralleling and
[1:07:48] we got a parallel in order for you to
[1:07:50] really truly understand a woman that'll
[1:07:52] go and and and tear down her husband to
[1:07:55] another woman well what are you doing
[1:07:58] you you are you are hurting your
[1:08:00] influence number one and then number two
[1:08:03] you are you you're you're you're missing
[1:08:06] the whole point you say well you know
[1:08:10] you're you're you know we're all equal
[1:08:13] no we're
[1:08:14] not no we're not the headship is the
[1:08:19] man the headship is the man the headship
[1:08:22] is not the woman the woman is to submit
[1:08:26] herself to her
[1:08:30] husband now if you want the blessings of
[1:08:33] God you've got to follow that now this
[1:08:37] is where God is amen with his bride it's
[1:08:41] the same thing to where we can come in a
[1:08:44] setting like this and the now listen the
[1:08:47] church is claiming to be equal with
[1:08:52] God it's the feminine spirit till we've
[1:08:56] got all of these thousands of churches
[1:08:59] mega churches mega churches and they're
[1:09:03] all claiming to be the
[1:09:06] bride but they're claiming to be equal
[1:09:09] with God's word isn't the absolute so
[1:09:13] they're claiming to be equal with you
[1:09:15] are not equal with the
[1:09:21] word praise the Lord now we're we're
[1:09:23] getting awfully quiet in here but this
[1:09:25] is what he's this is what he's teaching
[1:09:27] you you you come from him you came from
[1:09:32] God so we
[1:09:33] surrender everything we are Amen to
[1:09:38] Christ Jesus the word somebody say Lord
[1:09:43] I want you to be my
[1:09:46] Lord I want you not to just be my Lord
[1:09:49] in word but I want it in heart and in
[1:09:53] deed all right now
[1:09:56] okay so
[1:09:59] um let's see now now and and now brother
[1:10:02] brandham speaks of this he he um
[1:10:07] uh the uh brother brandham talks about
[1:10:10] it there in U uh what I what I just
[1:10:13] brought to you I believe it was in
[1:10:17] um taking I I believe it's in taking
[1:10:20] sides with Jesus and and so brother Bram
[1:10:23] is really is is is is is really bringing
[1:10:27] this out because and he's talking about
[1:10:29] the Corinthian Church who he was
[1:10:30] bringing this to you see that he said
[1:10:32] the Corinthian Church was looking at the
[1:10:34] Apostle Paul as just one just a has been
[1:10:38] and so they were spiritual they had all
[1:10:41] the gifts they had everything going and
[1:10:43] so they were they were saying well you
[1:10:46] know God's visiting us and so when the
[1:10:47] Apostle Paul is standing up there amen
[1:10:50] and brother Bram goes to the history he
[1:10:52] is standing up and says whoa whoa whoa
[1:10:54] did the word come to you through you or
[1:10:58] did it come did it come through you or
[1:11:00] did it come to you he says let him which
[1:11:03] is
[1:11:04] spiritual
[1:11:06] acknowledge that I am the prophet of the
[1:11:09] Lord you you see what I'm saying in
[1:11:11] other words it was God they had to
[1:11:14] surrender their thoughts to the
[1:11:17] leadership of that day amen you got to
[1:11:21] do it they were required to come under
[1:11:25] the the headship because God had a
[1:11:28] specific purpose for those ages and that
[1:11:32] Prophet was to bring them in line or to
[1:11:35] fight against that spirit that was
[1:11:36] trying to come against that church and
[1:11:38] they had to hear they had to hear those
[1:11:42] Messengers or they would they they would
[1:11:44] miss it and so today we've got to hear
[1:11:48] if there's ever a time for us to hear
[1:11:50] the messenger of our age and to really
[1:11:52] understand we're not going into another
[1:11:53] church age this is the dressing of the
[1:11:56] Bride this is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:00] looking for a bride who has submitted
[1:12:03] herself unto him amen All Right
[1:12:07] Now Praise the
[1:12:11] Lord let's see here
[1:12:14] um all right have have you noticed at
[1:12:16] the very last paragraph have you noticed
[1:12:19] in Revelations 22 and 17 the spirit in
[1:12:21] the bride say come let him that is a
[1:12:24] thirst or hear us say come the bride
[1:12:27] speaks the same word as the spirit does
[1:12:29] she is a word bride proving she has the
[1:12:32] spirit in every Church age we hear these
[1:12:35] words he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:12:40] what the spirit sath unto the churches
[1:12:42] the spirit gives the word and you have
[1:12:45] the spir if you have the spirit you will
[1:12:48] hear the word for your age as those true
[1:12:51] Christians took the word of their age
[1:12:54] did you get that last thought I repeat
[1:12:57] every Church age ends with the same
[1:12:59] admonition he that hath an ear let him
[1:13:02] an individual he what the spirit says to
[1:13:05] the churches the spirit gives the word
[1:13:09] he has the truth for each age each age
[1:13:12] has had its own elect and the elect
[1:13:15] group always heard the word and received
[1:13:18] it proving they had the seed in them
[1:13:22] John 8:47 he that is of god heareth
[1:13:25] God's words ye therefore hear them not
[1:13:28] because you are not of God they refuse
[1:13:31] the word Jesus and his words for their
[1:13:34] day but the true seed Reed the word
[1:13:39] because they are of God and all thy
[1:13:41] children shall be taught of God the Holy
[1:13:44] Spirit uh Isaiah 54:13 Jesus said the
[1:13:48] same thing in John uh 6 and and and 45
[1:13:52] being one with the word proves whether
[1:13:55] you're of God and spirit filled no other
[1:13:59] criteria can you say Amen no other
[1:14:02] criteria so so so to prove who you are
[1:14:07] see you see how Pentecost has totally
[1:14:08] missed it Pentecost has got all of this
[1:14:11] going this direction and that and oh
[1:14:14] they're doing great they're they're
[1:14:15] they're they're building hospitals
[1:14:17] they're helping third world countries
[1:14:19] they're doing all of these things and
[1:14:22] and and they've got all of these gifts
[1:14:24] all of these manifest stations and all
[1:14:26] God's looking for is someone to just
[1:14:29] acknowledge his word and give him honor
[1:14:32] that's all God's looking for someone to
[1:14:35] acknowledge his word and give him
[1:14:40] honor amen so so this this unfolding of
[1:14:44] the drama amen that matters of fact
[1:14:46] let's just let's just go back because
[1:14:48] because now now you understand Jesus is
[1:14:50] the word how many understands that but
[1:14:53] you came from him that's the reason why
[1:14:56] it's easy for you to submit to him and
[1:14:59] others are not uh it's not easy for
[1:15:01] others to submit because they didn't
[1:15:04] come from
[1:15:06] him Hallelujah now you're still going to
[1:15:08] deal with your flesh I'm not saying I'm
[1:15:11] not saying that you're never going to
[1:15:12] you you're you're never going to uh
[1:15:15] argue with God or you're never going to
[1:15:17] uh uh have a different thought than God
[1:15:19] in this mind cuz this mind is enmity
[1:15:22] against God but but but but but but but
[1:15:25] but only the soul that came from God can
[1:15:29] surrender to
[1:15:32] God I I love him so much let's go back
[1:15:35] let let's look something real quickly uh
[1:15:37] let let's look go back to
[1:15:38] 150 and we'll start there at the uh
[1:15:41] let's see we're one 2
[1:15:45] three the whole thing back here is good
[1:15:50] but amen
[1:15:55] uh the the third paragraph there it says
[1:15:57] 150 in the third paragraph now it says
[1:15:59] that he hath chosen Us in him Jesus
[1:16:03] before the foundation of the world that
[1:16:05] means we were right there with him
[1:16:08] someone shout hallelujah in the mind and
[1:16:11] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[1:16:13] the world that gives an eternal quality
[1:16:17] to the elect you just you can't get away
[1:16:22] from that Hallelujah do you love him let
[1:16:26] let's let's turn over there's another
[1:16:27] one that I that I like here I've got
[1:16:29] I've got I've got this page here just
[1:16:32] marked look look how heavy I've got that
[1:16:34] marked hallelujah amen let's look at
[1:16:37] that real quickly uh
[1:16:40] 152 and we're going to start there
[1:16:42] breaking in that paragraph just the
[1:16:44] second line it says these who are of the
[1:16:48] royal seed are the elect are the
[1:16:52] predestinated forn of God were in the
[1:16:55] mind of God and His Thoughts in very
[1:16:57] plain language the true bride of Christ
[1:17:00] was in the mind of God eternally though
[1:17:03] not expressed until each came forth in
[1:17:06] the designated decree season as each
[1:17:09] member came forth uh it became expressed
[1:17:13] and took its place in the body thus this
[1:17:16] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:17:20] bride who is
[1:17:22] Christ the word right who are you the
[1:17:27] word you were chosen in that word oh if
[1:17:31] you could understand and come under
[1:17:33] submission to that word you'll be just
[1:17:36] as powerful as Christ
[1:17:38] is you would be just as powerful because
[1:17:41] you're under his
[1:17:45] authority if my wife wants me to smile
[1:17:47] at her she she's not going to be jumping
[1:17:49] down my throat and uh and and and
[1:17:51] telling me where to get off I I I that
[1:17:54] don't bring smile if you want Christ to
[1:17:57] smile at you you're going to you're
[1:18:00] going to say Lord thy will be done even
[1:18:03] when you don't understand it when you're
[1:18:05] in your sickness when you're in your uh
[1:18:07] uh uh when you think it should be
[1:18:09] another way when you think it should be
[1:18:10] no no no you're surrendering yourself to
[1:18:12] him and it brings the smile you are part
[1:18:16] of
[1:18:17] him all right let's continue to uh read
[1:18:20] here it says and took his this this
[1:18:22] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:18:24] bride and though she is feminine in
[1:18:26] designation she is also called the body
[1:18:29] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[1:18:32] ought to be called that for she was
[1:18:34] predestinated in him come from the same
[1:18:38] Source was eternal with him and as now
[1:18:41] manifesting God in a many membered body
[1:18:44] whereas God was once manifest in one
[1:18:46] member even our Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:18:49] then we are coming to a conclusion as
[1:18:52] the Eternal logos God was manifest in
[1:18:56] the sun in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[1:18:59] of the godhead bodily and that Eternal
[1:19:01] one was the man was the father manifest
[1:19:04] In the Flesh and thereby gained the
[1:19:06] title of son even so we turn to your
[1:19:09] neighbor and say he's really preaching
[1:19:11] now amen even so we Eternal in his
[1:19:18] thoughts in our turn become the many
[1:19:22] spoken word seed manifest EST in flesh
[1:19:25] those Eternal thoughts now manifest in
[1:19:27] flesh are the sons of God even as we are
[1:19:30] so called we did not become seed by the
[1:19:33] rebirth but we were seed and therefore
[1:19:37] were reborn for only the elect can be
[1:19:39] reborn because we were seed is the
[1:19:42] reason we could be quickened in nonse
[1:19:45] there is nothing to Quicken hold this uh
[1:19:49] this carefully in mind now take the next
[1:19:51] step redeem means to buy back it
[1:19:54] restores the original owner God by his
[1:19:58] death shed blood or the shed Blood
[1:20:02] Bought back his
[1:20:04] own that's your time to say hallelujah
[1:20:07] hallelujah he bought back the spoken
[1:20:10] word seed bride my my sheep hear my
[1:20:13] voice word and they follow me you you
[1:20:17] always were a sheep you never were a pig
[1:20:21] or a dog turned into a sheep this is
[1:20:23] impossible for every kind of Life
[1:20:25] produces the same kind and there is no
[1:20:27] change in species as we were in the
[1:20:30] thoughts of God and then expressed in
[1:20:31] flesh there had to come a day when we
[1:20:34] would hear his voice the word hearing
[1:20:36] the voice become aware that our father
[1:20:39] calling us recognizing that we are Sons
[1:20:42] we heard his voice and cried out as did
[1:20:44] the prodical son save me oh my father
[1:20:47] I'm returning unto thee well that should
[1:20:50] just make you oh that makes you
[1:20:53] rejoice because you were now now you
[1:20:56] understand you see now I'm want to and
[1:20:58] and that's that's that's all we're going
[1:20:59] to read out of the uh the pergamus uh
[1:21:01] Church age for tonight and now I I I I
[1:21:04] want I want to now as the as the um
[1:21:08] Prophet is bringing this out there how
[1:21:11] that it is there's only one special
[1:21:14] group that can hear the words to that
[1:21:19] age and the reason that group is so
[1:21:23] special because they came from the very
[1:21:26] thought of God that Jesus came from and
[1:21:29] as Jesus says my meal my meat is to do
[1:21:32] the will of my father so is it to his
[1:21:36] many membered bride saying my meat is to
[1:21:39] do the will of my
[1:21:43] husband now I just told you the
[1:21:46] blessings and the authority that comes
[1:21:49] from surrendering to the word now this
[1:21:53] and you want to write this down you can
[1:21:54] write write this down I've got I've got
[1:21:55] about five quotes here I'm going to I
[1:21:57] want to give to you that's not in the
[1:21:58] church age book amen this is the spoken
[1:22:01] word seed it says the so he says the
[1:22:06] Bible is manifested again like in the
[1:22:08] early days of Christ because you are a
[1:22:11] pre predestinated seed like Christ was
[1:22:14] and when the rain falls on the seed the
[1:22:16] life produces itself when the Holy
[1:22:19] Spirit Falls can you say Amen now amen
[1:22:24] now he would go on down and he goes you
[1:22:26] know he would say he says now uh Jesus
[1:22:29] he uh Jesus said he chose them before
[1:22:32] the foundation of the world they were a
[1:22:34] predestinated seed then they hauled
[1:22:36] themselves up into the upper room these
[1:22:38] seeds the word and the Word was laying
[1:22:40] on there without any life in it and all
[1:22:42] of a sudden there came a sound from
[1:22:44] Heaven as the water began to gush down
[1:22:46] and it actually filled all the house
[1:22:48] they were sitting and the seeds begin to
[1:22:49] grow it begin to manifest itself the
[1:22:52] word of God being made being manifest
[1:22:54] all right why why then
[1:22:58] uh uh being made manifest the word of
[1:23:00] God uh or manifest itself the word of
[1:23:03] God being made manifest now now I I want
[1:23:06] us to look here there in the peram well
[1:23:08] actually this is in the church age book
[1:23:10] if you want to just turn there real
[1:23:11] quickly uh it's it's in um well I
[1:23:16] don't
[1:23:17] Hallelujah let me see if I can find it
[1:23:20] here for you amen um okay it's it's on
[1:23:25] page it's on page
[1:23:30] 170 yeah it's on page 170 and the first
[1:23:34] paragraph I wonder if we're sufficiently
[1:23:37] impressed with the word in our midst let
[1:23:40] me give you a thought here how do we
[1:23:42] pray we pray in jesus' name don't we
[1:23:44] every prayer is in his name or there
[1:23:47] isn't any answer yet in 1 John 5:14 we
[1:23:50] are told this is the confidence that we
[1:23:52] have in him that if we ask anything
[1:23:55] according to his will he heareth us and
[1:23:57] if we know that he hears us whatsoever
[1:24:00] we ask we know that we have the petition
[1:24:04] that we desire of him that now now we're
[1:24:06] talking about coming under that
[1:24:08] Authority amen now we ask what is the
[1:24:10] will of God there's only one way to know
[1:24:13] his will and that is by the word of God
[1:24:16] limitations 3 and 37 who is he that
[1:24:18] saith and it cometh to pass when God
[1:24:21] commandeth it not there it is if it
[1:24:23] isn't in the word you can't have it so
[1:24:26] we can't ask unless it's in the word we
[1:24:28] can't petition or ask unless it is in
[1:24:30] his name there it is again Jesus the
[1:24:33] name is the word the will you can't
[1:24:37] separate God and the word they are one
[1:24:40] now when this word and here's what I'm W
[1:24:43] to get to when this word that has left
[1:24:46] that he when this word he has left
[1:24:49] behind on the printed page is a part of
[1:24:52] him when you accept by faith into a
[1:24:55] Spirit-filled life he said that his word
[1:24:58] was life John 6
[1:25:01] 63b but that is exactly what he
[1:25:04] is John 14:6 I'm the way the truth and
[1:25:08] the life Romans 8 and9 If any man have
[1:25:10] not the spirit he is none of his there
[1:25:11] it is he is the spirit and he is life
[1:25:17] that is exactly what the word is that is
[1:25:19] exactly what Jesus is he is the word so
[1:25:21] when a spirit born spirit spirit filled
[1:25:25] man in faith takes that word into his
[1:25:28] heart places it upon his lips while that
[1:25:32] is the same as deity speaking Every
[1:25:36] Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[1:25:40] before that man oh can you say Amen if
[1:25:45] the church way back there in the third
[1:25:47] age had only held onto the revelation of
[1:25:51] the Living Word in their MST
[1:25:55] the power of God would not have faded as
[1:25:59] it did in those dark ages and right
[1:26:02] today somebody say right today when the
[1:26:05] church returns to the word in faith we
[1:26:09] can say without doubt someone say
[1:26:12] without doubt that the glory of God and
[1:26:16] the wonderful acts of God will be in her
[1:26:21] midst again it's all head ship coming
[1:26:25] under that headship entitles you to his
[1:26:31] glory now now it's debatable whether
[1:26:35] these sisters when they come under under
[1:26:38] your headship and my headship you know
[1:26:40] we might not have too much glory to
[1:26:41] share with them but God has
[1:26:44] Glory I ain't got too much I can share
[1:26:47] with my girl but I guarantee you he's
[1:26:49] got it that he can share with me so no
[1:26:52] matter where I'm at or and and my wife
[1:26:54] too as long as she's under the headship
[1:26:56] of the word when we come under the
[1:26:58] headship of that word all of Heaven is
[1:27:01] at our disposal you children when you
[1:27:04] come under the head you might you might
[1:27:05] not have a you might not have a rich mom
[1:27:08] and dad or anything of that nature but
[1:27:09] when you come under the headship of the
[1:27:11] word you're coming under the authority
[1:27:14] therefore the glory of who God
[1:27:18] is oh praise the Lord can you say Amen
[1:27:24] amen that's that's that's exactly right
[1:27:27] and so amen what is this what is this
[1:27:30] Glory brother wend and the fifth seal
[1:27:32] brother brandom says I believe the hour
[1:27:34] is approaching when missing limbs will
[1:27:36] be restored and the glorious power of
[1:27:38] the Creator I believe if he can make a
[1:27:41] squirrel appear that has no here if the
[1:27:43] man or woman with just a Miss A Part
[1:27:46] missing that that's the complete animal
[1:27:48] in itself he is God I love him amen
[1:27:51] another one uh he says he says placing
[1:27:54] of a son to take out in a certain place
[1:27:56] and ceremony before the angels and place
[1:27:58] him positionally what he is in the body
[1:28:00] of Christ then that person has the
[1:28:02] authority let me say this if you count
[1:28:04] me a fanatic from this night on the very
[1:28:06] same thing that I'm speaking of will be
[1:28:08] done there will be a power put in the
[1:28:10] church and now is coming in that the
[1:28:12] holy go Holy Spirit Will so anoint the
[1:28:14] people till they will speak the word and
[1:28:16] it'll create itself right there we
[1:28:18] haven't seen the power that's likes
[1:28:20] coming into the church I know it for a
[1:28:22] fact say un this mountain be moved and
[1:28:24] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:28:26] what you've said and it shall come to
[1:28:27] pass you can have what You' have said
[1:28:29] the placing of the church in position
[1:28:31] where the power with the fullness of the
[1:28:33] power of the Holy Ghost comes into the
[1:28:34] church then critics mouths will be shut
[1:28:38] can I hear an
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] amen another place it says it says uh
[1:28:43] one cell goes into another and another
[1:28:45] cell is built on top of that it's not
[1:28:47] one human cell and the next a dog and
[1:28:48] the next to cat and something else it's
[1:28:50] absolutely straightly human being and
[1:28:52] when a man is born of the spirit of God
[1:28:53] he don't in anything into his life it's
[1:28:55] the unadulterated word of God Vindicated
[1:28:57] for that hour he takes the full word he
[1:29:00] don't pull no Creeds nothing else with
[1:29:01] it it's purely unadulterated God's word
[1:29:04] made manifest Among Us what is it now
[1:29:07] listen this cannot just be a Creed it
[1:29:11] cannot just be amen a we
[1:29:15] religion this is a Living Word come
[1:29:18] under the headship of that word and let
[1:29:21] that word live
[1:29:26] I'd rather have that than all the
[1:29:27] shouting and the dancing and everything
[1:29:29] else I love the shouting I love the
[1:29:31] dancing and I I I just can't ever see
[1:29:34] myself not dancing I can't see myself
[1:29:36] not shouting I I I get I sometimes when
[1:29:38] I'm studyed I'm over here and all of a
[1:29:40] sudden I'll just start amen as I'm as
[1:29:42] I'm reading and preparing for the for
[1:29:43] the sermon I'll just start screaming out
[1:29:45] and shouting hallelujah amen that's who
[1:29:48] I am but see it's the word it's a

[1:30:42] you're going to speak that creative word
[1:30:44] as you have surrendered yourself to
[1:30:50] him amen sister sister Rebecca Martin
