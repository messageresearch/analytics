him said he wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive it he said he wants to heal you a thousand times more than you want to be healed that's the God we serve tonight I'm so glad we don't serve a dead God and God is someone's imagination but we serve the Living God tonight amen you know I've said it before I heard Brother David Tyler one time said it it just always stuck with me said he was over in India and he watched a man fashion out of God with his hands he said he set that God down and began to worship it brother David's father said I was looking at that and I thought I'm so glad that I don't serve a God I made with my hands but I serve a God who made me with his heads we're his people and all he ever asked us to do was to believe him if those can believe all things are possible the dead can be raised blinded eyes can come open the lame can get up and walk because that's the kind of God that we serve amen and not only can he heal our physical bodies but our Spirituals he can lift us out of depression [Music] bipolar come on some schizophrenic amen sometimes sickness is not always in the flesh people deal with battles and there's minds and but our God can deliver everyone we can leave these meetings this week completely restored you say how could you say that because that's what my daddy said he said in his word I will restore saith the Lord and there's one thing about my daddy he don't lie oh praise the Lord we're greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and counted just an honor to be able to be with you once again this year and We Trust something to be said to help you and just a wee bit nervous and try to open up the meetings but we Just Surrender ourselves to him that he would just maybe speak something to you tonight amen thank you brother Wendell for having us the nice place to stay and the food and all that's done for us may the Lord richly bless each of you if you have your Bibles tonight we want to read from two places we want to read from Matthew chapter 16. starting at verse 24 and then we'll we'll have a word of prayer and be seated and I'd like to read from Judges chapter 16. certainly kind of an honor to be here and so happy that my wife Cheryl is able to come with us this week it's always good to have her with us and amen Matthew chapter 16 verse 24. then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if she if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we've gathered here from many different places this evening Lord we come for one purpose and that's to lift you up for you said Lord if I be lifted up I will draw all man unto myself and Lord we know in a Congregation of this size there's many needs but Lord we serve the god who's able to meet every need and I pray tonight Lord that this thought that you placed upon our heart would cause us Lord to look deep into ourselves and to see what it is that we really want to accomplish in these meetings oh God may it be that when all things are said and done and the bibles are closed May each of us leave here closer to you Lord for truly that's why we come that we can be fashioned into an image that you would be pleased to dwell in the father we asked your blessings upon brother Wendell and the officers here of the church and my Minister and brothers that you'd use them in a great way Lord that signs and wonders would be brought at their hands that this community Lord this Pony Nation would know that we serve the Living God the Lord we commit this service into your hands This Night For Your Glory bless you children father that when we leave the building may we say did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke with us along the way granted Lord we pray for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says and may God bless you may be seated now I want to read from judges it's where we want to take our thought from tonight but Judges chapter 16 starting at verse 27. and the Bible says this now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and there were upon the roof about 3 000 men and women that beheld by Samson made sport and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes and Samson took over the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of one with his right hand and the other with his left and Samson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life his greatest Victory came from his death may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on this day I will give my all this day I will give Mao you know I wonder how Samson must have felt when he was escorted into the arena that day being led by a child a man who once had strength that he could pick up Gates and pack them up on a hill weighing two tons a piece I think it was and setting them down and now he is being led by a child bound Ed to hear the chants and the laughs of those that God had raised him up to destroy to feel the spit and the wine on his face as they made sport out of Samson the brother better said Jehovah never lost the victory but it was Samson that lost the Victory and let me say tonight and let me be honest with you I may have lost the victory now and then but I want you to know that Jehovah never has I may have stuck my toe but Jehovah never has I may have lost the battle now and then but I want you to know tonight that my God has never lost a battle Hallelujah so tonight I'm not trusted in myself I'm not trusted in my ability but I'm trusting in a God who can not fail and even though I may lose a battle now and then I serve a captain Hallelujah and we've already won the war amen you see God had raised him up to destroy Philistines but Samson lost his vision he had forgotten what he was put here on the earth to do and let me say tonight God just didn't call us to come and sit on the Pew God didn't call us just to be some kind of a religious something or another but he places on this Earth the Sons and Daughters of God and he never placed us here to lose he never placed us here to give up he never placed us here to turn back but he placed Us in because he predestinated us before the foundation of the world that this would be our day our time our season our hour that we would bring forth the manifestation of the word of God hallelujah amen when we come through those doors we need to come through I've come for a purpose I was born for a purpose and they ain't nobody can take my place nobody can ever take your place God placed you here for a purpose but you see he forgot that something he let something get between him and his God he had forgotten who he was amen it's not all the time a woman sometimes it can be other things well that got quiet but it's true amen sometimes they let other things come between us and our God like our job our career come on he forgot who he was and as they spit on him and as they threw wine on him and the Roar and the laughter of the crowd he began to remember you know I wonder what point it was that Simpson decided he had had enough and sometimes you just need to be sick and tired of being sick and tired sometimes you just need to declare war on that job that's bothering you on that thing that's holding you oh that sickness on that barrier you need to declare a world and to say no more I have come to defeat you you've pushed me down you beat me down but I say no more I've had enough I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God Amen and I have rights that's given to amen I have rights that's been given to me by Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen Samson had enough of being jerked around and I pray that something in this message tonight will cause you to remember the prophet said God stirred up the Ephesians by telling them to remember God told them to remember he said evidently something that left their minds they had forgotten something but he told them to turn back in their minds to the point of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and The Wonder of it and I say if you're here tonight and maybe you have forgot the glory and The Wonder of this message of understanding that God shouts you out by a prophet we never come looking for God he'd come looking for us God sent Elijah to find you amen and if you remember a time when you were closer to God a time when you was on fire a time when you was more committed you was more surrendered what's happened to the prayer lives what's happened to the fasting we want revivals with no fasting we want healings and deliverances with no prayer meetings well it's getting quiet but it's open tonight amen but if you can remember a time that you was closer to God said God never left Samson Samson left God 's never left us he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you it ain't God it's us and if you can remember a time then I say to you let this be the meetings this week a time of renewal let this be a time of recommitment a time of dedication a time of consecration a time let it be a time to light the fire again to be touched by a fire that the world will know that you're burning amen amen Samson begin to remember the victories he began to remember the power the feeling of being in Fellowship with God do you remember maybe you're here tonight maybe it's this is for you you remember you say yes yes I remember bro I remember what what what shall I do why don't you do what he did he began to pray and the prophet said he began to pray right this wasn't a God blessed Mama God bless Daddy thank you for the day and jump into the bed prayer but he began to pray from the very passion of his heart he began to pray let me die with my enemy Lord avenge my two eyes you see this wasn't just a weak prayer he realized if God entered this prayer it meant his very life but he was willing to pay the price this day I will give my all that I can accomplish what God put me on the earth to do I don't want to get there that day brother Kitty and the Lord said you failed to do what I called you to do but when I get there that day I want to hear him say Well done [Applause] he began to pray from the very passion of his heart he realized what he was asking he knew what it was going to take God told the Ephesians look at what she once was in your heart and in your mind and in your life and then go back to that you remember you remember that night you met him remember where he brought you from I do remember said you must die with your enemy that's right you must die to the enemy that's got you in this condition whatever's holding you down whatever is holding you back whatever's tripping you up whatever is beating you down this is the weak to get the victory you see before there could be a victory there has to be a Victor and we know we've got what Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the victory Simpson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back out he began he's seen what he was raised up to do not be a showman not just to be a message follower but to be a servant amen to have himself so that the power of God could flow through him that's what God's looking for in this hour he's looking for some conduits you know what a conduit is it's a channel I used to work with a Vietnamese surgeon and he used to say no conduit no conduit he was a vascular surgeon he said if there's no Channel you can't do it no conduit no conduit and that's the way it is amen God's looking for a channel God's looking for a young person an old person a mama a daddy a brother a sister somebody that he could get into his hands amen and the Holy Spirit can flow through this that he go Hallelujah the only eyes God has is your eyes the only lips he has is your lips your hands your feet amen and God he's made us a co-parter with him in this pile of redemption that he would use his body on the Earth to find that last seed amen amen amen he was willing to give everything to get back to the place where he wants was can I say to us tonight myself do I say to us are we willing to give a self-sacrifice to have a move of God well I'm waiting for Brother Sean I'm waiting for Brother John waiting for Brother and oh no maybe God's waiting on you a self-sacrifice well I want to be healed why do you want to be healed for what are you willing to do but remember I'm talking about the girl down in Arkansas that was blind and her daddy got the money and she got separated from me you know the story and she said if you give me to the Healer I'll find my daddy myself I'd rather been prayed for this girl and God opened her eyes and she began to scream remember since she read and then the people said I who is what's blind can now see and the prophet said there was an old fella standing there with a with a the third foot standing there with an old club and he said I know who you are brother Branham I Know Who You Are I've been standing here three days in the rain just to be prayed for sometimes people can't set 30 minutes they start looking how long is he going to preach but here was the man with a twisted up foot but he was willing to stay there three days because he knew there was a God who could do something for him if you believe there's a God who could do something for you then I say to you reach out to him tonight call him on the scene tonight how bad you want a move of God how much do you want God to move in your life are we willing to push our plates back are we willing to spend time in prayer Samson said Samson said come on let me die with the Philistines he bowed himself with all of his might he wouldn't pretended he wasn't going through the motions just raising his hand he meant it with all his might his cry was sincere his heart was honest and the prophet said Christ will appear before any honest heart no matter how insignificant you may seem to be Hallelujah God don't need a prophet to call him on the scene God don't need a pastor to call him on the scene he just needs someone with an honest heart this is God I believe you can do something for me [Applause] he bowed himself with all of his might and the Bible said the house fell upon the Lords upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than that which he slew in his life three thousand lives after a completely surrendered life he had his greatest victory he fulfilled what God sent him to do after a fully surrendered life I will give Mao the prophecy here not long ago in Switzerland standing up there in that big high Ops Mountain I was thinking about Arnold Von Winkler and many of you know the story what a gallant hero he lives the many years in Switzerland and how the Swiss nation was being invaded by a mighty Army and the cities were being taken and the Gallant blood of that Swiss the people congregated from the mountains to The Valleys with such little weapons as they could defend themselves with and when they stood there on that field and they looked approaching them and when they were approached this great army they were outnumbered 50 to 1. and they were they wasn't soldiers they wasn't trained they didn't know what to do they didn't have M16s they had holes and rakes and pitchforks had shovels [Applause] that's what they had against an army that they were outnumbered 50 to one they didn't know what to do this Army that was invading was well trained every man was like a brick wall coming right at them coming right at this bunch of farmers who the only battle they ever had was trying to get the cow out of the barn and when they were standing there with their Spears moving up one great man stepped out we don't need a house full we just need one one great man stepped out on a Van Winkle and as he stepped out there in the presence they were hopeless everything they could think of was lost they would simply have to go down their homes be lost their families would be killed the fatherless would be destroyed there was nothing they could do it was hopeless then Arnold Von Winkler stepped out and said Swiss Brothers this day I will give my life for Switzerland and the homelands and they said what will you do Arnold he said over on the hill you're under I've got a wife I got two girls that I love with all my heart but this day I will never see them again grab your weapons grab your weapons and follow me and he screamed and threw up his weapon and said Make Way for Liberty and he started towards that Army he went right towards the thickest of the Spears and when he got right down to where they was a hundred Clement Spears to catch him and as he cut me through up his hands and said Make Way for Liberty and he grabbed a big arm full of those Spears had threw them into his chest and each one of those switch soldiers followed behind him he broke the ranks of the enemy and they won a victory like has never been won before well I say tonight God get us heroes in this meeting that are willing to break the ranks of this enemy every barrier every hindrance may be broken by the power of almighty God if we have to pray we'll pray easily at the fast will Fast if we have to cry we'll cry whatever it takes this day if we have to repeat we'll repent whatever it takes to bring the victory [Applause] today and today you can mention his name in Switzerland and their eyes will color with tears and their cheeks will flush for their hero that was one of the greatest heroes to my opinion that's being in Army life that's heroism seldom compared with and never exceeded until one time there was a small thing that was the small thing he said when the sons of Adam stood in the corner and the sons of Adam's race and they were defeated and God sent them law and they couldn't keep it they went after something else he sent them prophets and they wouldn't keep it and there was ignorance in the illiteracy and sin and sickness and disease breaking down the whole human race every Hope was gone that the human race could be saved then In Heaven There was one who stepped out and said this day I'll give my life for Adam's race and when he looked over the Earth he saw where the greatest fear man had was and that was death and he read to a certain place called Calvary and there he caught Death In His bosom that he ascended up on high and he said wait Over Yonder till you're a dude with power from on high he sent back the Holy Ghost and said follow me and fight with everything you've got to fight with [Applause] Jesus came he suffered he took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death this day I will give my all for Adams race and are we are we this day willing to do to take the same wrath that he taken are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves up to God all the world and the things of the world to serve you are we willing you see the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he'll not knock your door down you must open the door you must be willing such examples of ultimate sacrifice but you see sometimes we think because we can't give big that our contribution is small so it doesn't matter because I I couldn't do something like Arnold done I couldn't do something like one of these preachers could do so you know it don't it don't really matter sometimes we think because we can't give big things that we should give nothing at all but that's wrong thinking because you see what made what may not seem like much to you is literally everything to someone else in a soup kitchen in New York where they fed the poor they would have donations to help feed the poor and clean it up after one of the meals there was beside a plate 83 cents with a note and the note said please forgive me for the 83 cents but it's all I have he didn't give a hundred dollars right he didn't use Apple pay 83 cents because that's all right please forgive me for the 83 seats but it's all that I have look I may not Minister like these brothers I may not have a Ministry like that I may not able to be steamed to just sing like some of these people I may not be able to pray like someone else but let me say when these meetings come to the close this day I have given my hope everything everything I have given it my Lord and George told the story the story of King George when they let the school out because they was kind of having a parade and they gave the little children a flag and they were to sing a song when the king went by and so when it got back to the classroom the teacher counted the kids there's a little girl missing so she went to find her and she found her down beside a box of mailbox or something like that and the little girl's crying she said honey are you okay she said yes Ma'am why are you crying this someone been mean to you oh no ma'am no it's been well honey why are you crying did you see the king yes ma'am I I saw the king did you wave your flag with everything that was within me did you sing that yes ma'am I sung the song then honey why are you crying she said teacher I saw the king I waved my flag I saw my song but she said I was so little I saw him but he couldn't see the brother said that may be true for King George but it ain't terrific he says everything he sees the spot that that some people would look over but to him it means so much how do you write notice all she ever said when brother Venom told the testimony all she said was that's nothing but the truth but it broke God on the scene the puppet said you want a million dollars speak it it'll be on the table said about the salvation of my two boys and they fell across their lap the Bible said Jesus said over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasure and many that were Rich cast in much and there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing about a half a penny a half a penny and he watched her and he called unto him his disciples and he said unto them verily I say unto you this poor Widow has cast more in then all they which have cast into the treasury Casper she didn't even put in a penny but he said she has put more in than everybody else has put in this day for all they did they cast from their abundance from their abundance they might have been on the cell phone you know making a big business deal or whatever they had in the pocket a few hundred just stood in and just kept on going but not her came in maybe a song stooped over just a little purse a Granny's purse you remember granny had those purses she's holding on to it like a treasure because that's what it was to her it was a treasure she opened it up carefully maybe a little bit embarrassed and she put it in the Treasure and quickly closed the purse to leave but Jesus called his disciples said this poor Widow has cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did was cast into their abundance but she of her walked she of her won't nobody made her do it no matter if they asked you get what do you give it to us no no she wanted to do it and that's the way we need to come to this meeting I Want To Praise Him I want to worship him I want to see my brother help I want to see my sister deliver I want to see a move of God you've got to come with the world but she of her won't get cast in all that she had even all her living they gave him their abundance it didn't mean as much but she gave her all too much seems like nothing but I'm so glad with God little as much if God is in it you see God don't need something big he just needs something yielded that would be on a coffee cup he said for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ fairly I said unto you he shall not lose his reward compared to what others was given her seems so unimportant so insignificant but to the one who knows the heart he knew he knew that she had given all right and God help me that when we leave these meetings that he knows I've gave mom you see contributions to this treasure was voluntarily it could be paid yearly by the Jews for the service of the temple and the support of the poor nobody forced her to do it she wanted to do it but think about it if anybody was poor it was this woman she didn't even put in a penny but look at her attitude she thought someone was worse off than me perhaps they're worse off of me she never thought of herself she was thinking of others and that's perfectly eternal life it's not living for yourself it's living for others you see we are living in a selfish society today that's right that's why when the lot turns green they blow the horn behind you automatically because they think their part is more important than yours they'll say say Amen or else one I don't know do you know in 2013 Webster every year Webster dictionary picks a word of the year that reflects the mindset of the people and they'll pick one for for this side of the world and one for the other side of the world but in 2013 they picked one word that represented the entire world you know what that word was selfie I saw the other day where a woman in Texas married herself because she said she could find nobody that loved her as much as she loved herself of course if it ends up in a divorce I don't know how they split that up that's Plum funny I'm sorry they had a cake they had a preacher they had bridesmaids everything but a groom and then Jessica brought me a story well where a guy over in Italy married a pizza she said Daddy look at this this man married a pizza I said my Lord honey that marriage will be still in three days [Applause] you're going to Pizza marriages do you think amen I'm sorry she never thought of herself her thinking was of others and the prophet said that's perfectly eternal life when we don't live for ourself living for others God help me to be like that let us not be a people that has this attitude what's in it for me what can I get out of it but let us come with an attitude not only what I can get but what Can I Give [Music] when I was a little boy my daddy had a picture in our room of John F Kennedy and under the picture was these words ask not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country [Applause] and let's not be a people you know that that just gives out their access but let us be a people who give their all and not so much what I can get but when I come what can I give to this meeting what can I do to help these brothers what can I do to help that sister because we're a body we need each other don't you see friends what Satan's always tried to do what's the divide and conquer he said the American Indian lost this country because they were divided among themselves and there's never been a time I'm I'll be 64 in just a few days I've never seen a time in my life that this nation is as divided as it is right now it's the same tactic and now it's moved over into the message where he's trying to divide us but I say stay behind him stay with Christ the word [Applause] let it not just be a hymn let it be a commitment but I you know I can't sing like this brother and I can't pray like that sister but whatever you got just give it to Jesus like the little boy's lunch the prophet said he prayed the hooky his mama fixes some biscuits and some fish and he went over to the meeting and they said send the people away they're taking feet he said go among the people find something to feed him with and he found this little boy said what you got in that bag little fella says my lunch some biscuits and fish just enough for a little boy what are you going to do with it well I thought about eating it well would you give it to Jesus Jesus wants my lunch what's he gonna do with this lunch he's going to feed this multitude Jesus is going to feed this multitude with my lunch well it ain't much it's all I've got but if Jesus can use it I'll give it to him yeah he says those who's in that little boy's hand it was still his lunch it was just a little boy's lunch just enough to feed himself but when he give that what he had to Jesus when he'd give it over to Jesus what did he do Oh my he fed a multitude and when they got done what was it if I remember right 12 baskets I believe it was that they picked up a clock was left over and he goes home throws his lunch up on the counter and his mama said Junior didn't you eat today so oh mama did I eat oh God like the little the widow woman she's down in the Middleboro just enough left to make one cake and she's going to fix it and wasn't even going to eat it herself you're probably going to tell her son she wasn't hungry I had a moment like that God missed her soul was born poor I see my mama act like she wasn't hungry so we'd have something to eat and perhaps this way she was she thought I just I'll just make the cake for junior and I tell him Mama's not hungry then I'll set him on my lap and we'll wait for death so she mixed up the oil and the flower and all to make the cake and she goes out into the into the yard to pick up two sticks but little did she know that God had already ordained a prophet to go to her house and she went out to pick up those two sticks what did they represent a sacrifice Calvary and as she turned to go back into the house she heard a voice said would you bring me a drink you see he was just she probably had more water than she had food and he was a condo fella she said oh oh oh yes sir I'll I'll give you some water I'll share my water with you we're going to die anyway I'll I'll sacrifice my drink of water to you so when she turned to get the water then she heard and bring me a cake now he's not just asking for water but he's asking for everything she has and see this wasn't for herself if it had just been for her readily but now she's faced with decision and am I going to give this kind old man that cake that I was going to give my son yes but she was willing to give everything to this man and when she did you see he wasn't just asking for water now he's asking for all she had and she thought this day I'll give it all the way and when she committed to surrendering what she had to the prophet there came the words that every True Believer longs to hear thus saith the Lord brothers did maybe you're called like that this morning to give up your what your unbelief to give up everything you've got to take the all in the word and mix it together and put it on an altar of self-sacrifice you'll find out it's a color God on the scene as certain as I'm standing in this Pulpit I surrendered life that's willing to give everything we'll call God on the scene every time I wonder today if God leads us to a life of complete surrender and service to him I wonder if our Spirits then sometimes don't rebel I wonder if we're lamb see a lamb is obedient a lamb is self-sacrificial it doesn't it doesn't take it claims its own it can lay right down and Shear the wool off of it that's the only thing it's got but it never says anything about it it just sacrifices everything it's got that's a lamb it gives everything away itself and all it is and that's the way a real Christian is their self-sacrifice thinking themselves self-sacrificing themselves rather carrying nothing for this world but giving all they've got to God amen there was a man had a little girl she was dying on life support and this man said father I give her to you because I can't help her I give her to you you see as long as that man helped that little girl's life all he had was a baby girl on a ventilator but when he gave her to God God raised her up and gave her back to that man and healed her and restored her you say how do you know that because I was the man it was my little girl and when I gave her to God a few years later I was out and the Lord spoke to me and said because you gave me Jessica I gave Jessica back to you and I say give that wayward son give that Wayward Daughter give that arthritis give that sugar diabetes give that fear give that depression whatever it is just give it to God and see what God's able to do with it could have just a little bit more time a few years ago I was able to go down to Tennessee Stadium the volunteer football stadium I really don't care much about Volunteer football I couldn't even tell you who plays but I had the opportunity I thought it'd be nice to go see that Stadium it's a huge Stadium holds what was it 96 000 fans or 105 000 something like that so I take this tour and so they would go into the locker room and when we go into the locker room this is nice carpet but man I'm telling you that coverage is oh it's kind of I thought man and they come in here with cleats on but they just kind of sunk into it it was just so thick and I was looking around brother Kelly and they had all these names above the locker and I got the looking and there was Peyton Manning and Reggie White and men who had played for Tennessee who had done great things for Tennessee and they had their name above the locker so that when you had that Locker you could look up and say I I've got Reggie watch Locker I've got Peyton Manning's locker and I was looking at it and I thought you know God's got a locker room he's got a Moses and the Daniel and the David say if God was able to use that man God can use me and I got to look it around and out here there was two double doors and above it there was a sign and the sign said this day I will give my all for Tennessee and there's a picture there and what those ball players do when they run out onto that field they get in that locker room and they start they start jumping up and down and they start packing each other on the pads and smacking each other in the helmet so don't be beating on each other but that's the way we ought to come to church is excited excited don't knock your neighbor out now I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is we ought to come through these doors excited pumped up amen oh fire [Applause] you know I got on fire one time I was out burning some leaves I don't know ragged pair of pants and I was kicking them up into the leaves up into that fire and I stand there on a hole like this and all of a sudden my legs started getting warm I thought man my legs off of one another I looked down and said Jimmy crickets I'm on fire do you know what I've done I said my goodness look at that Rich it's almost up to my knee what's Cheryl going to say no I didn't do that at all scream like a wall get off my britches I'm not kidding I was on fire and friends when we're on fire let me tell you from the front row to the back road somebody knows it oh God left me with the fire Hallelujah that the world could see that I'm burning that the world knows I'm burning Hallelujah let him know I've met the god of fire I met the God who changed me who saved me who delivered me Hallelujah who's gonna change my body let the world know you're on fire and I was looking at these pictures that they had them everywhere and they had a picture of what these guys would do is that when they would run out that door they would be there and the doors would open and they would run out onto the field of 96 000 screaming fans but when they went out those doors they would open they would smack that sign this day I give my all for Tennessee this day going out that I've got a sign above my garage coming out of my laundry room through the end of the garage says this day I will give my all for Jesus Christ because when I saw that brother window I thought I thought these guys they're willing to give their all for Tennessee they're willing to go out there to sweat to get bruised to get blooded to break bones to be paralyzed even some of them have died all for the sake of give them six Tennessee and I thought oh God if they can do that if they can slap that sign and run out onto that field God give me Grace Hallelujah that when I come through those doors back there I will say this meeting this night I will give my all if I have to sweat I swear if I have to cry cry amen when I come through those doors I want to be the best day man that I can be the best Hallelujah I can be I want to give my all for Jesus Christ and when this meeting is over I can save this day this day this day I gave my own for Jesus Christ you know why he gave us all for me this day whether I feel good or whether I don't whether my back's hurting or whether it ain't this day feelings emotion has nothing to do with it I have been called To Praise My Lord the Bible said that everything that half breath praise ye the Lord do you realize every time you praise the Lord you're giving the devil a black eye every time you're praised in the midst of your trial in the midst of your troubles and you throw up your hand and you begin to praise God and thank you for his goodness and his healing and his virtue and it's Deliverance you know what you're doing you're stopping that devil under your feet [Applause] when Ali my youngest was a little old girl I was preaching up in Kentucky we're standing outside after service I was talking to the Brother Ali was standing beside me she's about this high right here she's standing beside me and I was talking to the brother and now he goes I thought what in the world I said and I said something else he goes I said I said something else she goes I said Ali what are you doing you're ruining my Ministry behave I said what are you doing she goes it's a bug Daddy it's a bug and I look down this bug was running around it's just trying to stomp it oh that's what you need to do you need to realize the devil he ain't nothing but a bug the Bible said every devil every devil the message says every devil is under our feet under our feet amen you need to tell him you're under my feet oh boy and I come to stomp you down all right this day I will give my all for Jesus Christ Jesus hold the cross look at him hang in there they'd beat him till they couldn't beat him anymore his blood pouring out his sweat pouring out his tears he helped nothing back he never gave him his excess he never gave him his abundance he gave his all everything he had and the dying Thief watching him one began to mock him he said get us down if you are who they say you are Jesus never answered him a word but the other Thief notice his attitude he said leave him alone he's done nothing wrong we are getting what we deserve and he began to notice as we close he began to give Jesus his praise he gave Jesus his confession he gave Jesus his proper place what he was able to forgive and he said to him remember me remember me this dying thief on a cross didn't have money didn't have a checkbook all he had was the words of his heart leave him alone he's done nothing wrong we're getting what we deserve he began to praise him he's beginning to give him his proper place and then he said would you remember me Jesus in his dying moments on the cross he pushed up and trying to breathe in he said this day this day you with me this day you shall be with me Paradise oh God said listen what God's only trying to do as we come book close he's trying to find one person he can get in his hands he's always tried to do that all done through the Bible he found in Isaiah one time he found a Jeremiah you've got to give your all to God your reverence your respect your everything that you are just be nothing just see how little you are and that's what God wants us to do that's real humility is just simply giving God everything we are but said Lord they come for self-sacrifice that come to fill that hot burning fire of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll light up the Cross of Christ in their hearts and will fill them with power and glory and the baptism of the Holy Ghost granted Lord you've got to come the way Jesus came through a self-sacrifice given your all to God walking up to Calvary to be crucified with him and Rise Again to where His Garment of sacrifice and death to the things that are of this world this day this day the sign may not be above the door of the sanctuary but put it above the door of your heart tonight say this day these meetings I'll come for one purpose to give myself away to give everything to him that my brother can be healed that my sister can be helped that that Wayward boy can find the Lord that when the meetings are over we could say this day he has met with us this day
