are here this morning Father God we just ask Lord you move in a real special way Lord and set every captive free we ask it For Your Glory in Jesus name amen amen ask you to turn to very familiar scripture this morning probably one week can quote by heart but want let turn to Psalms 23 and verse one amen it's good to be together once again we had just a wonderful time in the Lord last night and I tell you it's been just a wonderful camp th far and amen as they say I'm looking forward to get good her and gooder and good amen and just want to say that I'm thankful amen that my wife was able to come my daughter Katie and several from our church and and we appreciate them coming means a lot to a guy when people from your own church come here you you know but uh anyway we're thankful Amen to the Lord for all that he's done for us and and uh amen for the opportunity to ser serve him in this time that we're living in what a blessed people we are amen I wanton you just turn to somebody and say I'm blessed I'm blessed amen amen Psalms 23 and verse one it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff that comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemy thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen we let let you be seated last night I would come into the service and sit down and begin to sing and the Lord begin to deal with me on a thought for this this morning and as brother brother Michael if he'd go and grab my iPad there on the little machine there run up to the there and he went and grabbed it for me and I sat in the back and Lord just begin to pour these things in my heart and I believe it's something that he has special for you this morning amen I I like to speak to you on choosing Faith over fear choosing Faith over fear it says in Hebrews chapter 11 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen are which are seen were met not made of things which do appear and I I want to read that in the Amplified if you don't mind it says now Faith is the Assurance or the title deed or the confirmation of things hoped for that are divinely guaranteed amen the evidence of Things Not Seen the conviction of the reality of their reality Faith comprehends this fact which cannot be experienced by the physical senses for by this kind of Faith the men of old gain Divine approval for by faith that is the inherent trust and enduring confidence in the power and wisdom and goodness of God we understand that the worlds this universe the Ages were framed and created formed put in order equipped for their intended purpose by the word of God so that that which is seen was not made out of things which are visible Amen in other words God didn't take something that was already here and speak this word or or bring this world into into into into fruition but he actually spoke his word when there was nothing amen and there was nothing there was a void there was an emptiness and he just said let there be and from that word amen this world that we see today exist amen I I I've said it like this before I believe in a Big Bang Theory but I believe the bang was let there be and the word brought forth amen manifestation of what was inside of his heart and and I began to think about all these Hebrew Heroes of Faith and amen why were they called Heroes of Faith because they chose Faith over fear amen they chose to believe when no matter what they saw they no matter what they felt what circumstances were they chose Faith you know faith will either uh fear will either paralyze your faith or your faith will paralize your fear amen you know in Hebrews chapter 11 they're called Hebrews of Heroes of Faith Faith because in spite of what they saw in spite of what they felt in spite of their circumstances that were surrounding them they believed amen you know Faith finds a source that others can't see amen you know we've been given this on this Earth five senses to contact this world that we're living in see taste smell feeling here and every one of them no doubt has probably used all of them this morning amen when we got up and we begin to see that it was sun shining we begin to feel the Rays and amen begin to smell the the air that was the fresh clean air and all the things and feel the breeze Upon Us amen we used all of those senses but when it comes to the supernatural amen that's not what that's not the S that's not the things you depend upon Amen to determine if the Supernatural is there or not because the Supernatural is there whether you feel it or not whether you see it or not whether you whether you whe whether any of these senses declare it amen the Supernatural is still there because God is still in our midst as we heard last night God is here whether you feel him or whether you see him or whether whether anything is declaring out of your body that he's here God is still here why because his word says he is and that is where Faith rest is upon the word of God you know Faith doesn't rest in what somebody told you or or what some man told you or what some Minister told you Faith rest upon the word of God Amen I'm not healed because some man said I'm Healed I'm Healed because the word says I'm Healed I'm not delivered because some man said I'm delivered I'm delivered because the word said I'm delivered amen this is where we got to put our faith that's where we got to put our trust it's not in our feelings not upon some some man's ideas or what they can say but on the word of God because the word of God is still be there when your feelings are letting you down the word of God will still hold you when your feelings are washed away amen when the word of God will still stand there when all the circumstances is against you that word will still remain true this is why he gave us something we can depend upon amen I'm looking here this morning I see the earth I see the skies I see the sun what's a very spoken word of almighty God and you didn't get up this morning worrying if the sun was going to come up you knew inside your heart that son's going to come up why cuz there was a word that said let there be light and that word is still in manifestation today thousands millions of years later it's still performing what God said he would do Hallelujah Faith amen is a six sense Faith you know the five senses are fine as long as they don't de disagree with the six sense but when there's a disagreement you always take the six Sense come on Amen see faith is the substance of things hoped for not you don't maybe you don't see it maybe you don't taste it maybe you don't feel it maybe you don't smell it maybe you don't hear it but you know it why cuz Faith declares it so amen it's so sure that it's real it becomes a substance to it not imagination it's something that you have and in faith there's no reasoning to it Faith knows what it's at Faith acts Faith holds on it won't move nothing can move it I don't care whatever says this or whoever says that it doesn't move it a bit it'll stand right there am man say wait wait just a minute that don't make a difference it'll stay right there what is faith faith is something that is revealed to you that you not know you may not know yet but you believe it anyhow amen faith is a revelation of the will of God what is the will of God the word of God Amen if you want to know the will of God look to the word of God cuz the word of God is his will he amen amen faith is a very amen something that's precious to PE ought to be precious to you amen cuz there's a lot of what people in this world but there's a lot of people that don't believe amen Luke chapter 18 and verse one if you'll turn there he said he spoke a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always pray and not faint and there was a city that was in a city saying in there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regard regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continually come and she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust said unjust judge said he shall and shall not God avenges on aect which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with him I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen listen to what and I I understand people put that off to to to when he returns and that that that is true amen when he comes back will he find Faith but I I if you look at what he's talking about he said it is a need this woman had and she's asking for the for the him to come and provide for this need I don't know what her need was but she was crying out to him we heard it on the first night amen crying out to him how do you cry not why you speak the word of God God you said this God your word says this it said this in your word you said you would never leave me you said you would never be there you would always be there you would be my comforter amen you cry out to him by the word he said but notice he didn't say will I find righteousness will I find churches will I find holy people will I find faith when when I come amen so if you've been here asking for something when he comes will he find you still in faith you've been asking for the Holy Ghost you've been asking for needs in your body but when he comes will he find you still knocking will he find you still asking will he find you still seeking in faith believeing he's coming he's moving on my behalf he's here to meet my need will he find faith in other words faith is going to be something that's very precious what what makes something precious that not a lot of people have it how many he's got a how many he's got a a a wedge of gold right now no no I don't see very many people's got that what makes gold so precious cuz there ain't a lot of it if it was just out there on the ground everywhere it wouldn't be so precious no more amen but what causes people to seek after why because it's precious and and faith is something that's very precious because there's not a lot of it in the age that we're living in there's not a lot of people that believe there's there's not a lot of people that believe you know we're getting to the point that very PE very few people even believe in God even believe that this world we living was created amen by higher intelligence they don't even want to admit that they they don't want to admit that there's a God you know they don't they want don't want to believe in those things so but if will he find somebody that's got enough Faith to believe no matter what circumstances they're facing he's going to have somebody that's going to stand by themsel amen they may not have a lot of kids around them to pump them up and they may not have somebody there to always encourage them but their faith is not built on if somebody calls them if somebody texts them if somebody picks them up their faith is in the word of [Applause] God he said that's the way you want you want to get something from God be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time listen asking for the Holy Ghost is not a dry confession amen is getting down to business with God saying God if you don't come and fill me with the Holy Ghost you'll find a pile of balls laying here why there's something on the inside that wants to contact [Applause] God Lord I'm here I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands I'm going to stay hey you you getting tired of listening I'm having a great time knocking cuz why I know you're coming when that's when something happen he he has to get you off his hands so he comes out to answer you and faith is standing there to receive see faith is anchored on the word of God if God said it it's going to come to pass no matter what the symptoms are what the issues are what the circumstances are what how much unbelief is in the land it's going to come to pass unbelief you know relies on reasonings Faith don't L on reasoning Faith looks at the word but Faith places itself upon an unmovable Rock God's Eternal Word Faith don't look at reasons Faith ain't looking at reasons why I don't get called or why I don't get text or [Music] why amen why nobody loves me I use one of brother Jewel's favorite that saying wowy wowy Woos this ain't the service for your wowy wowy Woos it's a service you repent of your wowy wowy Woos amen because why should you be wowy wowy wooing when God came and he created this Earth for your benefit he created all the things around you for this benefit why should you be in your wowy wowy wounds when God not only chose you he didn't choose you right here he didn't choose you 5 minutes ago but he chose you before the foundation of the world and will not change his mind about you Hallelujah I might change my mind about you you might change your mind about me but God won't change his mind if God saw you as a son you'll always be a son you'll always be a daughter it doesn't matter what the devil says it doesn't matter what he does it doesn't matter how he htks it doesn't matter how much weary spirits and depression he tries to put on you you're still a son you're still a daughter you're still a child of the King open the door and let that wowy wowy woo Spirit [Applause] out well I ain't never had a minister give me a word you don't need a minister to give you a word you need to believe the word of God come on now we get our faith in what some man says well if I could just get somebody to tell me what's wrong with me you know what's wrong with you how to forget the faith to rise above it amen Faith finds the word it's a sanctuary of rest it moves right up into that Eternal Rock and lays down and rest right up on the word yes let the winds how let the storms Shake you're safe faith is resting on the word where Faith genuine Christian faith rest is on the word why you think brother Andrew's been haming it this weekend about the message and the absolute and all that because that's where our faith R lies why is the devil so against it because if he can know he can tear it down he can tear down your fa we got so many people that have wanted to stop brother brother Andrew talking about you know questions start Rising but they're not always honest questions and I just got a few questions another the reason why you got questions because there's sin in your heart people say well I just don't I ain't going to believe in that Prophet thing and I ain't going to believe that next thing you know they ain't believing in in Jesus they ain't believing in God they ain't believing in nothing yeah buddy you know I had a brother brother Andrew listen I'm on what brother Andrew said about Holiness last night I say amen and if you can't say Amen you need to get born again amen it's time to raise up the standard again when the enemy comes in like a flood it's time to raise the standard again there is a people that'll stand for Holiness well I tell you what that's just brother Andrew's opinion that's brother that's just brother bram's opinion you know I had a young man one time had tell me that you know he come he had it he had it all lined out why he can wear shorts well you know back in that day their shorts came up this far now shorts are down here what's the difference in me wearing shorts down here and the girl having a dress down here and he had that's his brother bram's opinion what do you think about it I'm well if you won't take his opinion why you going to take my opinion and so I said well you just got to let me pray about that for a minute and I'll give you an answer and I went back and I started praying God how am I going to answer this how am I going to come amen be able to be able to say what's right here I I want to answer this the correct way and the voice of God spoke to me and said ask him what influenced that [Applause] opinion amen could it be if it's just an opinion could it be that if the angel of God influenced that opinion he was in his presence night after n after n day after day after day so if that was influences his opinion what's influencing yours could it be that oh evil spirit is trying to put some doubt in your mind and cause you to [Applause] disbelieve water break we got to watch what's influencing listen if we're going to just put it all to opinions well who's what what it's just your opinion you don't like hearing that that's just your opinion I'm not resting my faith upon an opinion I'm resting my faith upon the word of God the supernatural word of God that is a resting place not a make believe not a hope so but Faith rest there it's done it's finished it's it's over amen Noah had Faith the ark would float Daniel had Faith the lion's mouth would be shut the Hebrew children knew God could put out the fire Jesus knew that he would raise up again said destroy this temple in three days but I'll raise it up again amen why where was he bringing that from from the word I'll not see my holy going to see corruption listen the the Mind battles was listen Jesus had mind battles he had mind battles he he had such mind battles that blood would come out of his skin he would sweat blood we all going to have one but where do you go back to when you're in the middle of that well I just don't feel it no more you're not always going going to live in a camp meeting feeling you're not always going to live with all of these Believers all around you you can make it amen hallelujah glory to God no you're going to get in places by yourself yay though I walk I don't I did not hear where it said me and a group of young people walked David wasn't walking with a bunch of people was by say yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil why cuz he's with me when I'm by myself he's with me when I'm at a camp mean he's with me if I'm in Walmart he's with me wherever I am he promised he would be there so this is where you got to put your faith you're not always going to feel the feeling you're feeling right now do I got some older Christians out there can say Amen to that you're not always going to feel all the rejoicing and all the praising brother Timothy I want to be happy this morning you will be don't worry but I'm trying to tell you you're not always going to be in these places but that don't mean you can't have faith because the word of God's the same whether it's at a camp meeting or it's in the high hardest trial of your life the word of God is the same whether you're on the Mountaintop or in the valley am that's what he told he heard the enemy say one time bring them on down into The Valleys cuz he's the god of the mountain but he ain't God Of The Valleys he said I heard what he said he said I'll bring them on down cuz I want him to know I am the god of the mountain but I'm also God in the valley he's want you to know this morning I am God in a youth camp but I'm also God in your bedroom I'm also God when you don't see nothing and it's all dark around you I'm still God Hallelujah I read you some meet I read you about a meeting that took an after meeting that took place okay Jesus and his disciples had been in a wonderful meeting blind were healed all kinds of things were taking place in Mark chapter 4:35 the same day even when evening was come he said unto them let us pass over into the other side now if they had have listened to what he said they wouldn't have worried about what happened before they got to the other side amen it's just like the children of Israel if they have listened to what he said I'm going to take you out of Egypt but I'm going to take you into a land flowing with milk and honey if they had just had faith in what he said they wouldn't have worried about the Red Sea they wouldn't have worried about bitter Waters they wouldn't have worried about no food they wouldn't have worried about no water they wouldn't have worried about the desert they would have just stayed with the word of God so if had to listen to what he said and believe what he said they wouldn't have worried about it and if you would just believe what he said he said I'm the author and the finisher so he's not going to get halfway in between and forget how to take care of his people maybe I need to say that one more time he's not going to get halfway or almost all the way or seventh eights away and forget how to take care of his people he will take care of you he will be with you that's what he promised I'll be with you even in you to the end of Youth Camp I'm glad he didn't put that in there but he said to the end of the world woo I like that right there let me just take it for what he said to the end of the world to the end of cancer to the end of sugar diabetes to the end of depression to the end of fear to the end of anxiety I will be with you you even in you but they get in this ship and Jesus rests he goes to sleep he's weary been in a big meeting oh and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on the pillow and There Rose a great storm of wind verse 37 waves beat the ship and now it was full they done bailed all they could out it was going down boys and they remember wait a minute there's somebody in the ship see sometimes you get in the middle of a storm and you forget cuz we're not listen brother Ram preached two things he preached about those that went off without Jesus and he came walking on the water and he preached about those that went with Jesus and they forgot he was in the ship we ain't went off without Jesus but sometimes we get in the middle of a storm and we forget he's still in the ship he's still here and they walk and master cares not that we perish and he rose and rebuke the wind and said un the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great form a calm and he said to them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith you done seen Miracles you didn't seen signs and wonders you didn't seen the miraculous you didn't seen all these things how is it still you don't have faith see doctors say well you know that's paralysis or that's leukemia or that's cancer and fear sets in fear accom accompanies these words but it but listen to the prophet of God he says but it shouldn't who is this that made the promise what are we living for why are we the Church of the Living God why are we filled with the Holy Ghost to remember in times of trouble he is here to remember in times of trouble he is here amen he is with us just to say he might be resting a few moments between meetings but he's still here just to say when trouble sets in and Faith of him being with us then fear sets in and when fear sits in that's when we really get in trouble we have that in church all and in the Nations and everywhere he said are scared to death about an atomic bomb and you know science has developed mechanical things at any moment without warning the whole world can go into pieces and the world is scared he said I'm not scared of the world go into pieces because I know there's going to be a thousand years of Millennium Reign after all this is over God won't defeat his own purpose amen one thing I pray Lord am I right when he comes that's the only worry scare I have have I pleased you Lord so don't fear What men's doing fear God say don't fear Him who can destroy the body but he that can destroy both body and soul in hell that's right arguments and so forth trouble sets in fear we seem to be the whole lot the same today remember he's still with us when brother Andrew got to preaching last night I like Lord that's why you dropped that in right before he started because God's trying to remind us he is still here he's trying to tell you young people You Are Not Alone Hallelujah you are not alone he's still here he's still with us amen what is it the devil wants to come and bring fear but don't forget he's in the ship they should have known these disciples he was the messiah messiah means the anointed one he he was God veiled in flesh they had saw the works they had saw the all these things take place he was he was the anointed made him fully Messiah he was the same spirit that was upon Him is not in portion in the same quality with portion upon us but he said that makes us Messiah s which would be little sons of God adopted sons of God his holy spirit seals into his body and we are his children should nothing bother us nothing worry us we're his one time I saw this I don't know if it's a t-shirt or a cartoon or what with this dorky looking lamb walking beside on the rod and and he's holding the his little clo and hoofs you know it's a cartoon he's holding his Hooves there holding the hands of Jesus dorky is looking sheep you ever saw boy you can get a lot of things on sheep I'm going to stay out of that and there's this Old Line in the in the in the edge of the road and he's he's roaring and this dorky looking sheep looking at that mean

cars coming down hundreds of horse y'all still trying to catch that one and he said let him raise his hand up and blow his whistle and the brace go he ain't got power but he's got Authority he said when a man or woman that's been Anointed with a baptism of the Holy Ghost he might not be able to read his name in Box Car size letters but but not have any better education but he's got Authority from God cuz he's a son let him take his authority and stand on the word and say stop and Satan's wheels [Applause] go in my name they shall cast out Devils I've told this story before but I like this

is a cure for every devil in hell let's go to what cures the fear Deuteronomy 3:18 I commanded you at that time saying the Lord your God has given you this land to possess it you shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel all that are meat for war but your wives your little ones your cattle for I know that you how much cattle shall abide in your cities which I have given unto the Lord has given you rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and unto they also possess the land which the Lord your God has given them beyond the Jordan and then shall you return every man into his possessions which I have given you and I commanded Joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings so just pick out two of the fears out of these two kings so shall the Lord do to all so shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms whether thou [Applause] passes and ye shall not fear them for the Lord your God shall fight for [Applause] you ye shall not fear them Deuteronomy 31:6 says be strong and of good courage do not fear nor be afraid of them for the Lord your God he is the one who goes with you he will not leave you or forsake you Psalms 34:4 said I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears a do Z amen but you have to choose Faith you got to choose to believe you got to choose to trust and in the middle of our struggle we forget he helps we forget he's the deliverer so we try to wrestle it all out and figure it out on our own and all along God is waiting and ready to hear our cry for help help me Lord that's all he needs you need him this morning all you got to do is have that sincerity in your heart help me Lord help me Psalms 563 says whenever I am afraid I will trust in you oh yeah you're going to get afraid but you can still trust fears I'm not trying to say that fears will be no more when you leave this Youth Camp I'm trying to say that you have power over the fear fear you have the ability to choose to believe choose to trust choose to say God is God amen amen choosing faith is choosing to trust God no matter what it's not that everything will be perfect and everything's a bed of roses for some of you better not be a Bed of Roses cuz you're afraid of flowers better roses or everything will work out just fine and Danny and hun Dory no you're going to go through trials you're going to go through problems and troubles and many difficulties read about The Heroes of Faith some were didn't even wouldn't their names wouldn't even mention but they were swn aunder they gave their lives amen it's in the moment of fear we should know where to turn to it's not turning to Google it's not a three-step process it's not a book or a mentor that you turn to or even a friend and I'm not saying friends can help you during hard times sure but the first thing you need to turn to is the word of God Psalms 23 as we read in verse four y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they Comfort it sometime we Face the hardest the darkest the scariest of all trials it might look like suddenly sudden some sudden tragedy or some some diagnosis or something we wouldn't we couldn't ever imagine or some family crisis we didn't see coming but God saw it coming hello somebody God God saw it coming it's even in the darkest of times God can guard and he can carry you through it when we feel like God is absent or we feel like he doesn't care we can still rest on the truth of his word even in the dark even in the shadow of death God is still there he's near he's ready for you to reach out and take a hold of his hand he's not so far that you can't you can't reach him he's there he's with you we heard it so beautifully last night he's here Isaiah 41 and verse 10 says fear not for I am with you be not dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen you yes I will help you I will uphold you with my righteous right hand God's hand in scripture is very beautiful you know we talk about having faith in God and and we see God's hand in every situ we talk boy did you see the hand of God there did you see the hand of God there but it's in the middle of this hand there's an instruction given fear not the question you might wonder is I see his hand but how is he going to help me how do we fear not when everything arounds us is calling for questions calling for fear calling for doubt the answer is to focus your eyes off your fears and back on your God Amen there's more for you than there is against you I can promise you there's more there's more faith than there is fear maybe I need to say that again there's more faith than there is fear there's more trust than there is worry there's more peace than there is anxiety there's more joy than there is depression there's more for you than there is against you amen you need to go back God is with me God gives me strength God gives me help god holds me how do you know cuz I just read it in his word his hand is not clinched closed and withdrawn just to see if you will survive he's stretching out his arms this morning he's stretching out his arms this morning saying I'll lift you up I'll hold you I'll make sure you're going to make it Hallelujah he is here this morning he's been walking down these aisles even as God has been moving I watched him some of you even now that little complex that little fear just fell off who took it off of you it was that righteous right hand said you got to know take your hands off of that one that was mine take your hands off of that one that was mine he just looking for somebody that'll reach a hand of Faith up and your hand or grab the hand of the man who can Hallelujah he's not withdrawn from you this morning well I hadn't felt him that matters not keep your hand up Amen brother Brandon was there was it Hurricane Mountain in that storm and he was headed the wrong direction and he said all of a sudden he felt somebody a hand touch him and turn him around he said when he turned around the clouds had parted just right to get a glimpse of a mountain wo I pray this weekend some of you might have been headed the wrong M may may have been headed the wrong direction may have been going the wrong way but God rich and mercy a hand reached down and it picked you up and it turned you around and you got a glimpse hallah you got a glimpse of Calvary and the work that's finished It's Already Done fear has been broken off of you Hallelujah anxiety is at your [Applause] feet just like a child needs a hand to hold when he crosses the road God reaches his hand down and he walks you cross the most difficult path some of you young people go through some difficult things when you've even said in your room nobody knows nobody cares God does God cares he spoke to me and said tell them one more time I care and I've got a hand if they'll just reach and grab a hold of it this morning I'll walk them through that trial I'll walk them through that difficulty and if I have to I even carry them whatever I got to do I'm going to make sure they make it Hallelujah do you realize what's his stake this morning with you making it or not God's name is at stake he said I'll say save a people for my name's sake what was he saying I'll save them in spite of their wrongs in spite of their mistakes in spite of them doing things I told him not to do I'm going to save them cuz my name has a reputation and my reputation is not going to be Mar but I am going to have a people I am going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish and if I got a hold him I will if I got to carry him I will whatever I got to do they're going to reach the other side [Applause] not only this but this verse we just read also tells you that he speaks reassuring words he isn't silent with his lips closed never giv advice never given wisdom but he gives a common command fear not and it's followed by this wonderful promise I will help you thank you Lord that's amazing it's something for a man to say that or a friend to say I'll help you but God said it what kind of help is that I tell you what kind of help it is it's the same help that open the Red Sea it's the same help that change bitter Waters into Sweet Waters it's the same help that provided food when there was no food it provided water when there was no water it's the same help that opened the Jordan River it's the same help that brought down the Jericho walls it's the same help that took a giot and took a rock and slew him it's the same help amen that was in a fire that was in a lion's den that was in a ship that was tossed around and it looked like it was going down you might need that help good it's here this morning and it's got a hand reaching down to [Applause] you that's the kind of help we've got Philippians 4: 6 oh my don't be anxious or worried about anything hello did I read did I I read that right Amplified version Don't be anxious or worried about anything but in everything every circumstance every situation with prayer and petition with Thanksgiving continue to make your specific request known unto God and the peace of God that peace which reassures the heart that peace which transcends all understanding that peace stands guard over your heart and your minds in Christ Jesus that peace is yours listen it's more than a song peace that the world did I got peace that the world didn't give and the world can't take away that's more than a song it's a peace that is still a peace no matter what the world is doing in other words you can still be at peace in a storm just as you were in a in a field of flowers or whatever mountaintops or wherever you're at amen you can still be at peace wind's blowing howling Church problems situation family struggles some of you come with some intense family struggles that it's a miracle you're even here this

I was for got to preaching on my people shall never be ashamed I ran across there in Japan they do this thing they call call it a certain name I can't pronounce it right off the cuff but they do a certain certain procedure with a pottery they they could be walking across somewhere with grandmother's favorite dish or whatever and they can drop it and it'll be broken they don't sweep it up and throw it away but they pick it up and they have found they can put it together using a technique that uses gold and they have found that the broken vessel fixed with gold is worth more than the original vessel Hallelujah listen God is not going to waste anything if you've been broken this morning he's got a cure he's going to take those scars and he's going to fill them with deity and the worth of the vessel is greater than the farmer amen what you were before is greater now because of the gold God has put inside of you [Applause] you it's incredible I don't know if I got still got let
