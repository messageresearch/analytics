[52:54] envision him to come
[52:55] but we want him to come the way he wants
[52:58] to amen did you enjoy that this morning
[53:01] I sure did you know
[53:05] I it's funny because it doesn't matter
[53:07] how old you get you think you're young
[53:09] you feel young in your spirit and I just
[53:14] I like young people and especially those
[53:16] that are on fire for God and the Zeal
[53:18] that they have you know we was listening
[53:22] a few days ago to a young preacher and
[53:24] he was was telling us he was 21 years
[53:26] old and he was going on and the way he
[53:29] was going on I you're
[53:31] thinking
[53:33] okay now I've been 21 almost three times
[53:37] now and he's going on you're like okay
[53:40] you're
[53:41] 21 uh
[53:45] okay but that Zeal you know that's what
[53:47] God likes is a Zeal for his word in his
[53:50] people doesn't matter how old you get or
[53:53] or whatever we should have that Zeal for
[53:57] God and his word and for God and his
[54:00] people all the time we shouldn't lose
[54:02] that that's right because that's what
[54:05] God that's what he's expecting from us
[54:09] amen let's turn in our Bibles don't want
[54:11] to keep you that
[54:16] long and let's turn into Matthew Chapter
[54:21] 13 and we'll read this scripture and
[54:37] prise the Lord I was telling
[54:42] them here a while back and uh you know
[54:46] all the preachers get up and they're
[54:47] like do you love the
[54:49] Lord everybody's like and I'm like in my
[54:52] mind this is just me now but in my mind
[54:55] it's like uh yeah that's why we're here
[54:57] because we love the Lord and then the
[54:59] brother was telling me after church he
[55:00] was like yeah you know I kind of use
[55:02] that as a filler I'm like okay that's
[55:04] fine but that's why we're here because
[55:06] we love the Lord right I mean maybe
[55:10] unless you're 10 12 years old and was
[55:12] drug here but we're here because we love
[55:14] God and we want we want to hear from God
[55:17] and and God has a way that he speaks to
[55:20] his people right come on all right amen
[55:24] amen and that's what we want is you know
[55:26] brother Bram told us we come here CU we
[55:28] want to hear from God God what are you
[55:29] expecting from us how do you you
[55:32] know show me Lord what you are expecting
[55:36] amen okay Matthew Chapter 13 and I want
[55:40] to read one
[55:41] verse and it's verse
[55:44] 35 and it says that it might be
[55:47] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[55:49] prophet saying I will open my mouth in
[55:51] Parables I will utter things which have
[55:54] been kept secret from the foundation of
[55:58] the world father as we come before you
[56:01] we sung the songs of worship Lord and
[56:05] father we just love you and we want to
[56:07] worship you however we can father and
[56:10] we've sung those songs now and we've
[56:12] done our part and we're expecting now
[56:14] father that you would do your part that
[56:16] you would come and break the Word of
[56:18] Life To Us Lord father help us give us
[56:21] an ear to hear you said blessed are
[56:22] those that have an ear to hear
[56:25] what the spirit is saying and help us
[56:28] Lord as a speaker to only say your word
[56:30] father take these lips of clay
[56:32] and not let nothing come out but what is
[56:35] your word father for we believe that
[56:38] it's ministering angels that come down
[56:40] if the man can get himself out of the
[56:43] way and that angel can come and speak to
[56:45] the people we just love you father we
[56:48] appreciate all that you've done for us
[56:50] and all that you do for us we just
[56:52] Commit This service into your hands
[56:55] in Jesus name we pray amen you can be
[56:59] seated I kind of's see have two thoughts
[57:04] here that I want to maybe blend together
[57:07] in a uh you know it's a good thing that
[57:11] the Bible says the foolishness of
[57:12] preaching because as a preacher you get
[57:15] going and God starts laying something
[57:16] out for you and you're like wow that's
[57:18] really good and you're putting down your
[57:19] notes and you're going this way and that
[57:21] way and you get up to speak and you're
[57:22] like what in the world did I just say
[57:25] because as you're listening you're like
[57:27] man this is not what how God put it
[57:30] together what am I doing wrong but God
[57:34] knows how to direct the thoughts or what
[57:37] the speaker is saying to each
[57:40] individual and if you've ever get in
[57:42] someplace and you get outgoing and
[57:44] you'll get testimonies back from people
[57:46] and they're like man God spoke to me and
[57:47] he's this and you're like I never said
[57:49] that that was not what I was saying that
[57:52] was not my thought or my intent but but
[57:54] see it's not like we're saying it's not
[57:56] what we think or how it should be it's
[57:59] the way that God does it because that's
[58:02] why we're here
[58:04] because we want God to speak to each
[58:07] heart individually and he knows how to
[58:09] do it he knows how to to get that one
[58:12] thing that will catch and will help you
[58:16] right because that should be our desire
[58:18] here is something that God can help the
[58:20] people with not to lift ourselves up not
[58:23] to we're not here to make ourselves
[58:25] great we're here that God can work
[58:27] through us to get his plan out to the
[58:32] people amen because we know God has a
[58:35] certain way that he will talk to his
[58:38] people right and that's what I from the
[58:41] very beginning when I came into this
[58:43] message
[58:45] and I always wanted to know when you
[58:47] know they said well God sent a prophet
[58:49] great but what did the prophet say
[58:52] because I was listening to the prophet
[58:54] when the prophet Prophet said that God
[58:55] will send a prophet because he wants to
[58:58] speak to the
[59:00] people God doesn't send a prophet just
[59:03] to say look I sent a
[59:05] prophet right why because the people
[59:07] turned that down where he would talk to
[59:09] them individually lift the ear so what
[59:12] they when they rejected that then he
[59:14] said okay I'll rise up a
[59:15] prophet and when I want to speak to you
[59:19] the prophet will come and speak to you
[59:20] amen okay
[59:22] good so I want to kind of take a topic
[59:26] of the new book living in the
[59:31] glare okay so I know okay now they're
[59:35] like okay now how's this that's a weird
[59:37] title but let me read this to you
[59:40] brother brandom in the message the
[59:42] presence of God
[59:43] unrecognized it comes in and it goes out
[59:46] people does not recognize it until it's
[59:48] past and they because that it never fit
[59:51] their theology it never fits the time of
[59:53] the day see what it is they're always
[59:56] living in the glare of another age
[1:00:01] always right and we know how brother
[1:00:03] brandom said they're not only looking
[1:00:05] backwards or they're looking out here to
[1:00:07] the Future they miss what God is trying
[1:00:09] to
[1:00:11] do right
[1:00:14] now so brother Bram says they're always
[1:00:16] living in the glare of another age and
[1:00:18] for myself I kind of bring everything
[1:00:21] back to what we call the
[1:00:23] message because God's not dealing with
[1:00:25] them
[1:00:26] anymore he's dealing with the message
[1:00:30] what we call the message but you know
[1:00:32] Paul called it the
[1:00:35] gospel you see so sometimes we start LIF
[1:00:38] lifting up
[1:00:40] something and we make that a something
[1:00:44] and not realizing that what we're
[1:00:47] preaching is the gospel the good
[1:00:50] news Okay so living in the
[1:00:53] glare
[1:00:55] so what happened was people even today
[1:00:58] in what we would call the message are
[1:01:01] living at something that God's done back
[1:01:08] here and not bringing it Forward right
[1:01:11] what did Brother brandom say what the
[1:01:13] people will do was they'll stop at the
[1:01:17] signpost and they'll point to the
[1:01:22] signpost not uh not pointing to what the
[1:01:26] signpost is
[1:01:27] saying right why do you have a signpost
[1:01:30] the signpost is trying to tell you
[1:01:32] you're going
[1:01:33] somewhere right and we're going in the
[1:01:36] rapture we are going to have a change of
[1:01:39] this body what they never thought of
[1:01:42] like brother Brown said he he even
[1:01:43] thought that it was like oh we're going
[1:01:45] to live on the cloud somewhere and play
[1:01:46] the harp and you know oh there goes
[1:01:48] brother window Hey Brother W how you
[1:01:52] doing right because that's what they
[1:01:55] thought but we know that's not true we
[1:01:58] know we're going to a place where we
[1:02:00] have bodies where we are going to shake
[1:02:03] one another's hands we're going to hug
[1:02:04] one another we're going to be able to
[1:02:06] sit down in
[1:02:08] Fellowship
[1:02:10] right so I think what happened was
[1:02:13] people don't um don't realize that what
[1:02:18] we had was a dual purpose
[1:02:22] profit so you're like what a d a purpose
[1:02:25] Prophet yes I do a purpose Prophet so
[1:02:27] what did Brother brandom say that a
[1:02:30] messenger was was uh how would you say
[1:02:34] what a messenger was sent to
[1:02:36] do a messenger is sent to
[1:02:40] one draw all the Believers out of one
[1:02:44] age bring them out close that age and
[1:02:49] then he opens another
[1:02:51] age you see sometimes we need to look
[1:02:54] and and
[1:02:57] uh like brother Brown said read between
[1:03:00] the
[1:03:01] line because we think well we're in the
[1:03:03] leodan age but you know there's two ages
[1:03:06] in the leodan
[1:03:07] age there was the Pentecostal
[1:03:10] age and then there is a bride
[1:03:14] age right that's what he said so I think
[1:03:17] what is happened is when brother brandom
[1:03:21] came and the angel came what did he do
[1:03:24] he came and brother Bram said this he
[1:03:26] said he came as one out of season he
[1:03:27] came to the Pentecostal church but
[1:03:30] that's not what he was sent for but
[1:03:33] being the messenger he had to what he
[1:03:37] had to pull the
[1:03:40] Believers out of that
[1:03:42] age seal that age the plague struck all
[1:03:47] right right and what did Brother Ram say
[1:03:49] the plague of the Pentecostal church was
[1:03:53] whism come on so that worldism is what
[1:03:57] caught those guys right brother brand
[1:03:59] said and we got to watch it because
[1:04:02] influences keep going
[1:04:04] on so brother random said that what
[1:04:08] their uh what they what they did was
[1:04:11] because they want to keep the
[1:04:16] children they brought rock and roll
[1:04:18] music into the
[1:04:20] church worldliness into the church to
[1:04:24] keep the
[1:04:26] children and we find not that per se but
[1:04:29] we find things going on in the message
[1:04:34] sorry but what they are doing and what I
[1:04:37] see going out there is they are starting
[1:04:40] to bring games and things to keep the
[1:04:42] children I mean there's churches out
[1:04:44] there that are building uh what do we
[1:04:47] call them in our day
[1:04:51] arcades to draw the children but but you
[1:04:54] know what the children need the same
[1:04:56] thing that we needed that's right the
[1:04:58] baptism of the Holy
[1:05:00] Ghost that's what will keep a
[1:05:04] person the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:07] will will keep that person serving God
[1:05:10] and wanting to be
[1:05:13] here that's what brings us together as
[1:05:16] the spirit of God we need that Spirit of
[1:05:19] our young people need that spirit of God
[1:05:24] spirit in their lives and that's what
[1:05:26] will draw them the same as draw
[1:05:29] you
[1:05:31] amen so what happened to me this is me
[1:05:35] now so when God called The Believers and
[1:05:40] that's what they were they were the
[1:05:41] Believers he called the bride out of
[1:05:43] that Pentecostal age he closed that age
[1:05:48] and now he was going to what open a
[1:05:51] bride
[1:05:52] age for for the people but what
[1:05:58] happened these that came out of this age
[1:06:02] the bride the the the uh elect of that
[1:06:05] age what did they come out
[1:06:08] under what was the influence of that age
[1:06:14] denominationalism so now these ones that
[1:06:16] come out of this
[1:06:18] age what
[1:06:21] happened they became the first pastors
[1:06:25] of the Bride
[1:06:27] age but they came out with an influence
[1:06:33] of
[1:06:35] denominationalism and they brought it's
[1:06:37] in the church age book actually if you
[1:06:38] want to go and read it and they brought
[1:06:41] that out it's not that they became that
[1:06:43] denomination but brother Bram said that
[1:06:45] influence is
[1:06:49] there the influence of
[1:06:53] denominationalism
[1:06:54] came into the start of the
[1:07:04] message so now the churches rise up and
[1:07:07] what happens they rise up under
[1:07:11] denominationalism you ever is this
[1:07:18] thing here we
[1:07:21] go so okay good it'll go back up
[1:07:27] easy so now listen I get this because a
[1:07:30] while back I was studying something and
[1:07:33] I was studying about the
[1:07:35] cloud and when it first when the F Cloud
[1:07:39] was
[1:07:41] first uh how would you say looked at all
[1:07:44] the
[1:07:44] time it wasn't
[1:07:48] until and I might not you know I mean
[1:07:50] you sometimes you you know what brother
[1:07:53] random said but but then you go back to
[1:07:54] try and find it you know how he said it
[1:07:56] to you but now you've got to uh um
[1:08:00] figure remember how he said it so that
[1:08:03] you could look it up okay good so it
[1:08:06] wasn't
[1:08:07] until what I could find was July of
[1:08:15] 1965 is when brother brandom said and
[1:08:18] started talking about how the angel came
[1:08:20] to
[1:08:21] him and said turn it right
[1:08:24] he said what turn what do you mean turn
[1:08:26] it right am I not looking turn it to the
[1:08:29] right but up until that time and it's
[1:08:31] still going on today what were people
[1:08:34] doing what was it always about the
[1:08:36] cloud oh look at the Angels here look at
[1:08:40] the wings here look it over here and you
[1:08:42] can see the wing of this one and that
[1:08:44] one and brother brandom's talking about
[1:08:46] he goes when I was there and the Seven
[1:08:48] Angels were
[1:08:49] there what was he always doing he was
[1:08:52] pointing to man
[1:08:55] right showing lifting up look at those
[1:08:58] angels oh they're great and they're this
[1:09:00] well we have that still today in the
[1:09:03] message we were talking about it in the
[1:09:06] back men wanting to build their own
[1:09:10] Kingdoms in the
[1:09:13] message trying to build themselves up to
[1:09:17] build their own ideals
[1:09:20] up and
[1:09:22] not what it was is all
[1:09:25] about and so now I'm starting to think
[1:09:28] and just cuz I get to go out and I go
[1:09:30] out all over and you see all kinds of
[1:09:32] things and we know just as the scripture
[1:09:35] says not all Israel is Israel not all
[1:09:37] that claimed to be the message is the
[1:09:39] message but brother brandom says what
[1:09:41] happens though is people out
[1:09:44] there all they see is the collectiveness
[1:09:47] of what we call the
[1:09:48] message so they look at that and they
[1:09:51] see what is going on there and and
[1:09:53] that's what forms their
[1:09:57] opinion so brother brandom finally turns
[1:10:01] and
[1:10:04] that's okay so brother Brandon finally
[1:10:07] said or the angel told brother brandom
[1:10:10] said turn it right turn it right what do
[1:10:12] you mean turn it right so finally what
[1:10:14] did he do he turned it right and what
[1:10:19] did he see
[1:10:21] Christ now the focus isn't on
[1:10:26] angels and on all that kind of stuff but
[1:10:28] the focus needs to be
[1:10:31] on
[1:10:33] Christ that's what our focus is supposed
[1:10:36] to be on Christ not upon all this angel
[1:10:40] or that great preacher or this church or
[1:10:43] that it needs to be
[1:10:45] upon
[1:10:47] Christ right after the the seals were
[1:10:50] open what did Brother Brandon preach
[1:10:54] Christ The Mystery of God revealed not
[1:10:57] the Angels not the churches Christ The
[1:11:02] Mystery of God
[1:11:05] revealed and so we need
[1:11:08] to because the Bible tells us if we lift
[1:11:11] him up he'll draw all men unto
[1:11:15] him now use that as uh because we know
[1:11:20] not all men are going to come but I was
[1:11:22] like to say well if we really lifting
[1:11:24] Christ up where are all men what are we
[1:11:27] lifting up to the
[1:11:29] people are we lifting our little thing
[1:11:33] up to the people or are we lifting
[1:11:34] Christ up to the
[1:11:37] people we want to be lifting Christ up
[1:11:40] to the
[1:11:41] people so my question then for the
[1:11:48] message and you just happen to be
[1:11:49] sitting here so I'm preaching to you
[1:11:51] guys but my question question for the
[1:11:54] message is what book are you reading out
[1:12:00] of okay so brother brandom says now it's
[1:12:05] hard to say this it's very hard because
[1:12:07] speaking to people who feel the same way
[1:12:09] I do the way I have been for many years
[1:12:11] but since the opening of those Seven
[1:12:13] Seals of the mels just behind the the
[1:12:17] mountain Yonder this has become a new
[1:12:19] book it's the thing that's been hid has
[1:12:22] been revealed as God prom promised in
[1:12:24] Revelations 10 he would do it and we are
[1:12:26] the privileged people that God has
[1:12:29] chosen of the earth that we might see
[1:12:32] and understand these things not some
[1:12:34] mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying
[1:12:37] to make it up it's the word of God made
[1:12:40] manifest proven that it's right proven
[1:12:42] not by science but by God that it's
[1:12:44] right God as I have said before in a
[1:12:47] message God doesn't need anyone to
[1:12:48] interpret his word he is his own
[1:12:51] interpreter he says it'll happen at
[1:12:53] happens that's it he confirms it and he
[1:12:56] interprets
[1:12:58] it oh well what book became a new
[1:13:05] book so at the beginning think about it
[1:13:07] for a moment at the beginning what did
[1:13:10] the when he was standing out there and
[1:13:13] the angel came down and told him what do
[1:13:15] the work of an
[1:13:17] evangelist make full proof of your
[1:13:22] ministry
[1:13:24] and so what did he do he took the book
[1:13:27] didn't say do the work of a prophet even
[1:13:29] though he was a
[1:13:31] prophet but it said do the work of an
[1:13:34] evangelist make full proof of your
[1:13:37] ministry so what was he doing he was
[1:13:40] going out there healing
[1:13:43] discernments he would say thus sayeth
[1:13:46] the Lord and every time it come to
[1:13:49] pass sir right not once did it ever fail
[1:13:53] yet many Rose up behind them like he
[1:13:55] said and they would have they would be
[1:13:58] almost
[1:13:59] 99.9% there but there was an element
[1:14:03] there that when they said thus sayith
[1:14:05] the Lord something didn't happen right
[1:14:08] it's like brother brandom said if you if
[1:14:09] you have a vision and you out there and
[1:14:11] you tell the vision and the vision says
[1:14:13] it's a white man or a man in a white
[1:14:16] shirt and this and that and the other
[1:14:18] and and this is going to happen and it
[1:14:19] comes down and you watch it but the man
[1:14:21] had an orange shirt on it wasn't from
[1:14:24] God everything else happened exactly but
[1:14:27] that one
[1:14:28] thing shows that it wasn't from God but
[1:14:32] like brother Brown said you you get
[1:14:34] something like that in the Pentecostal
[1:14:36] people they all run to and flock to it
[1:14:39] even though there's an element of
[1:14:43] uh untruth to
[1:14:46] it because that's how people
[1:14:52] are
[1:14:54] now brother brandom said so I like that
[1:14:56] the new book so what was he doing he was
[1:14:59] going
[1:15:01] out and believe it or not the book was
[1:15:04] still
[1:15:07] closed so he was
[1:15:09] like don't get mad at me so he was just
[1:15:13] like Luther the book was closed but
[1:15:15] Luther was able to get a little bit of
[1:15:19] it and go oh I see the just shall live
[1:15:22] by faith
[1:15:24] right so he is able to grab a hold of
[1:15:26] that out of the book and preach that in
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:29] book and God opened up the just shall
[1:15:32] live by faith and you know we
[1:15:35] still believe what Luther
[1:15:38] preached amen the just shall live by
[1:15:41] faith I believe that why it was God's
[1:15:44] word and what did God start doing he
[1:15:45] started building on the just shall live
[1:15:47] by faith he started restoring back this
[1:15:49] word but it was
[1:15:51] closed it was only only what they could
[1:15:53] see so now brother bram's going
[1:15:56] out so brother bram's going out doing
[1:15:59] what God told him to do but he was
[1:16:01] reading in the book just like the rest
[1:16:03] of them trying to find something he
[1:16:05] would see something and he would bring
[1:16:07] them that little oh there's a loose in
[1:16:09] there and he'd bring it back and the
[1:16:10] truth would come out to the people so
[1:16:13] brother brownon was talking about in the
[1:16:15] vision
[1:16:16] of in the evening messenger he said here
[1:16:19] I was with the Pentecostals he had a
[1:16:22] vision he said he was standing in
[1:16:23] between two trees one tree was the
[1:16:26] Oneness one tree was the Trinity and
[1:16:30] those trees were great big trees but he
[1:16:32] said his tree was bigger and God had
[1:16:35] given him fruit off from both
[1:16:38] trees that
[1:16:40] followed out in this
[1:16:42] message so now remember take that just
[1:16:45] for a moment and then when brother
[1:16:47] random talks about the uh the fishes the
[1:16:51] three PS of the fishes
[1:16:53] yeah right you remember that and so he
[1:16:55] starts off with the deal and in the in
[1:16:58] the vision and he's looking out there
[1:16:59] and he's looking down there and there's
[1:17:01] this Lake and there's a bunch of
[1:17:02] fishermen preachers out there
[1:17:05] fishing and what were they
[1:17:07] doing they were fishing and they were
[1:17:10] catching Fish Little
[1:17:13] Fish and brother brandham said he could
[1:17:15] see out there and in the vision there
[1:17:17] was larger
[1:17:19] fish out there and he goes I'm a
[1:17:22] fisherman I can catch
[1:17:24] those so he goes down there he said the
[1:17:27] vision now he's standing there he has
[1:17:28] the fishing pole in his hand and he's
[1:17:30] the Angel's talking to him and said now
[1:17:32] here's what you do he said you pull you
[1:17:35] throw out there your lure he says you
[1:17:38] give it a little pull and he says you'll
[1:17:40] watch you know you wonder where he gets
[1:17:42] those the terminology first pull second
[1:17:44] pull third pull so he W watches and them
[1:17:47] little fish what do they do they start
[1:17:50] following that lure right and and so the
[1:17:53] angel tells him he says now you do it
[1:17:55] you you'll pull one more time he says
[1:17:58] then what'll happen is those little fish
[1:18:02] will scatter and it'll attract the
[1:18:04] attention of the big
[1:18:06] fish out in the
[1:18:10] deep and so what did he do he gets all
[1:18:14] excited right he gets like good
[1:18:18] fisherman and you're and uh right he
[1:18:22] gets any works and what happens all the
[1:18:24] line and everything comes
[1:18:26] up and he's all tangled up and the and
[1:18:30] the um Angel tells him what don't get
[1:18:32] your lines tangled up in these times
[1:18:35] right come on because I I'm I'm trying
[1:18:39] to build to a question I want to ask
[1:18:41] you so why then brothers and
[1:18:45] sisters did the
[1:18:48] sword not come in his hand in
[1:18:51] 1947
[1:18:53] you ever think about that why did the
[1:18:56] sword not come in his hand in
[1:19:02] 1947 yeah it wasn't time and also he
[1:19:06] needed to
[1:19:07] learn to be a prisoner to God because
[1:19:13] what was he doing he said he was and
[1:19:16] this is his own words he was always
[1:19:18] doing things that the angel told him not
[1:19:21] to do right because in that message it
[1:19:25] also says I told you not to do that I
[1:19:28] know I'm sorry and what was he do he'd
[1:19:31] go to Africa with all them Minister
[1:19:34] brothers and what was he doing he was
[1:19:36] listening to them instead of what God
[1:19:39] told him to
[1:19:41] do he hadn't become that prisoner that
[1:19:45] God needed a prophet to
[1:19:49] be he had to become that prisoner he had
[1:19:52] had to become uh like he said everything
[1:19:57] Christ had to be preeminent in his life
[1:20:01] amen you know just like I've always
[1:20:03] thought and I always said you know it's
[1:20:05] way easier to say no to the devil than
[1:20:07] it is to say yes to
[1:20:10] God you know it it's hard sometimes to
[1:20:14] believe what God tells
[1:20:17] you we you know we say we're Believers
[1:20:19] and we would believe anything that Jesus
[1:20:21] told us would we
[1:20:24] did the
[1:20:26] disciples come I mean there they were
[1:20:28] think about it Jesus could tell us
[1:20:30] something directly and we wouldn't
[1:20:32] believe
[1:20:33] him you're like what what do you mean we
[1:20:36] wouldn't believe him well think about it
[1:20:38] at the Passover supper when Jesus told
[1:20:42] them said there's one among
[1:20:43] you that's going to betray me and
[1:20:47] they're like what
[1:20:49] who me am m is it me Lord am I going to
[1:20:53] betray
[1:20:54] you and what did Jesus tell him says
[1:20:57] well the one that's going to betray me
[1:20:59] is the one I'm going to give this piece
[1:21:01] of bread
[1:21:02] to he's going to betray me and he
[1:21:06] turned and he gave it to Judas and said
[1:21:08] go do what you need to do and they all
[1:21:11] still wondered is it me right you know
[1:21:15] how brother Brown said there's John
[1:21:18] laying on jesus' breast and Peter's like
[1:21:21] hey John
[1:21:24] me am I the
[1:21:29] one I mean it's
[1:21:31] crazy because that's just the way men's
[1:21:38] Minds The Way men's minds
[1:21:42] work
[1:21:43] but God knows all
[1:21:46] things just like we go I love this
[1:21:48] morning and I was just thinking that
[1:21:51] message um God rich in Mercy and we
[1:21:55] still get this wherever you go out but
[1:21:58] the first thing brother brandham does
[1:21:59] when he comes out he goes let's get away
[1:22:01] from the fear and scare of
[1:22:03] it he goes you're not someday are you
[1:22:06] going to be Sons and Daughters right now
[1:22:11] are we Sons and Daughters of God if you
[1:22:14] never were a son or daughter you never
[1:22:17] will
[1:22:19] be so why are you trying to work to be a
[1:22:21] son or daughter
[1:22:23] you either are or you
[1:22:25] aren't all right you know I liked how
[1:22:29] the brother was getting into it and how
[1:22:31] he was talking about you know God
[1:22:34] writing our names down in the book and I
[1:22:38] think sometimes people think that you
[1:22:40] know God was sitting
[1:22:46] there oh I think yeah brother
[1:22:49] Robert right brother Robert down looking
[1:22:53] oh brother William that's not it that's
[1:22:56] not how he was doing it no sir you know
[1:22:58] how he was doing it he was looking there
[1:23:02] right now brother window Brother Ray why
[1:23:06] because your
[1:23:08] names are engraved in the palms of his
[1:23:10] hands come on you have to be here to be
[1:23:16] there what is Redemption all about it's
[1:23:20] not oh God's going to come down and pick
[1:23:21] us up and take us someplace we've never
[1:23:24] been the only way you can be there is
[1:23:26] you had to be there
[1:23:31] before right that's how that's how
[1:23:34] Redemption
[1:23:38] works so this thought of the new
[1:23:43] book what book are you reading from
[1:23:46] Brother Bram says here immediately after
[1:23:48] that the angels of the Lord appeared and
[1:23:50] told about the seven trumpets or the
[1:23:52] seven SE seals that I was return back
[1:23:53] here to Jefferson Bill and preached the
[1:23:56] Seven Seals and there if anything said
[1:23:57] that was inspired it was in that there
[1:24:00] where the angel of the Lord met us in
[1:24:02] the Bible become a new Bible there it
[1:24:05] opened up and revealed all the things
[1:24:07] that the reformers and things had left
[1:24:09] out it was the complete revelation of
[1:24:11] Jesus Christ allog together new to us
[1:24:14] but perfectly exactly with the
[1:24:17] scriptures that's what the word which
[1:24:19] has always
[1:24:21] been wow so it wasn't something
[1:24:23] different but what was it remember
[1:24:27] why like his brother said it wasn't time
[1:24:31] there was a time that this was to be
[1:24:34] open and youve ever thought oh I just I
[1:24:36] just love
[1:24:38] it uh you know how brother brandom said
[1:24:42] that that angel Earthly Angel would be
[1:24:45] on Earth at the same time Revelations
[1:24:48] 10:1
[1:24:50] yes you ever think of it like that and
[1:24:53] then Here Comes brother Brown he's
[1:24:55] talking about he's up there in Sabino
[1:24:57] Canyon and he's praying and he has his
[1:24:59] arms up and what
[1:25:03] happened the sword came into his
[1:25:06] hand and he said his fit his hand just
[1:25:12] exactly you ever think about it
[1:25:15] Revelations
[1:25:17] 101 now this word was
[1:25:20] open and you see it
[1:25:23] and the angel reached down and placed it
[1:25:25] in the hand of his Prophet because it
[1:25:27] was open
[1:25:28] now and the word fit his
[1:25:32] hand
[1:25:34] exactly amen what draw drew you the
[1:25:38] voice not the signs and wonders The
[1:25:41] Voice Drew
[1:25:44] you the word Drew you that's what drew
[1:25:47] me I don't know what Drew you it wasn't
[1:25:49] the signs and wonders in hearing about
[1:25:51] all that but when you heard the word and
[1:25:53] it was open and it come perfect serpent
[1:25:56] seed that explains everything yeah I
[1:26:00] mean when you heard it did you like that
[1:26:03] sounds crazy no why because something it
[1:26:06] was
[1:26:07] open and you have an ear to hear when
[1:26:10] it's
[1:26:11] opened you are blessed because you have
[1:26:14] that ear but you have
[1:26:17] to
[1:26:19] hear what it was yeah it's just opened
[1:26:22] it all
[1:26:23] up when you read the church age book in
[1:26:26] the four horse riders it's like
[1:26:29] perfectly
[1:26:30] clear it wasn't you know the Holy Spirit
[1:26:33] going out on a white horse and like
[1:26:35] cupid and shooting arrows into people's
[1:26:38] hearts what that makes no sense
[1:26:43] whatsoever but people believe
[1:26:47] that it's just crazy but we don't why
[1:26:51] because we're not we're the ones reading
[1:26:54] let me read this to you we're the ones
[1:26:56] reading out of a different book but yet
[1:27:00] altogether it's the same book that
[1:27:03] everybody else was reading out of yeah
[1:27:05] right but only we know that it's been
[1:27:08] open right you know we're not the only
[1:27:11] ones that uh opened the Seven Seals or
[1:27:13] our Prophet there was other prophets
[1:27:16] David cares had
[1:27:19] wrote a book on the Seven Seals being
[1:27:21] know
[1:27:24] you see why because Satan tries
[1:27:28] to put off what God is trying to do like
[1:27:31] the brother was saying Satan knows God's
[1:27:33] plan
[1:27:35] amen he knows God's plan and he's going
[1:27:39] to thwart that plan all the time all
[1:27:42] right amen every chance he
[1:27:45] gets and we should be ready we should we
[1:27:48] should know these things amen you know I
[1:27:51] always think it's funny because I think
[1:27:53] about it in how we get sometimes but you
[1:27:56] know we think hey come here yeah
[1:28:01] you so this is how we think about it so
[1:28:06] you look at it as this is
[1:28:08] you and I'm
[1:28:11] Satan oh man oh he's so big I don't know
[1:28:16] you think
[1:28:20] you that's that
[1:28:24] but it's it's the truth but did you know
[1:28:27] it's the other way
[1:28:30] around this is Satan and this is
[1:28:33] you brother brandom told us when we get
[1:28:36] to the other side and you're going to
[1:28:38] look and you're going to go that was
[1:28:41] him I was afraid of that he caused me
[1:28:45] all that problem well I I I don't
[1:28:49] understand
[1:28:51] Lord
[1:28:53] yeah that's the
[1:28:55] truth that's like the I love that it's
[1:29:00] it's time to put Satan under your feet
[1:29:03] just like the brother said not be bowing
[1:29:05] down to everything he
[1:29:07] says you know it's like brother Brown I
[1:29:10] don't know but that's all
[1:29:15] right you know it's like brother Brown
[1:29:17] said Satan is more afraid of
[1:29:20] you than you are of him all
[1:29:23] right right right when the weakness of
[1:29:26] Christians gets down on their knees to
[1:29:32] pray he didn't just say the Devils he
[1:29:34] said Satan
[1:29:38] trembles because if you get a revelation
[1:29:41] of who you really are that's the truth
[1:29:44] then he has no power over you how does
[1:29:47] he have power over he Bluffs us into
[1:29:51] getting to think that he's bigger than
[1:29:53] we are and it's not we almost you know
[1:29:56] how people in before the book was open
[1:29:59] would look at the story of the um
[1:30:01] prodical
[1:30:03] son you know that's a beautiful
[1:30:07] story because I like the whole thing
[1:30:09] about it prodal
[1:30:12] son he was a
[1:30:15] son he never was not a
[1:30:19] son he was always a
[1:30:24] son
[1:30:29] right and when he went out there doing
[1:30:33] whatever going along and I mean we know
[1:30:35] the story so I don't like to keep but he
[1:30:39] goes out there and he's you know finally
[1:30:40] in the pig pin but what did he
[1:30:43] do the Bible says he come to
[1:30:50] himself he come to
[1:30:54] himself he
[1:30:57] realized what he wasn't part of that pig
[1:31:01] farm right but his
[1:31:06] dad oh brothers and sisters it's like I
[1:31:09] brother there in Anchor he's a deacon
[1:31:13] and he told us a long time ago he said
[1:31:15] but when he first came into the message
[1:31:17] and he was all one day he was standing
[1:31:19] in the GR in the line in the grocery
[1:31:21] waiting to pay for his food and he was
[1:31:23] looking around the people behind him and
[1:31:25] the people in front of him he said I was
[1:31:28] thinking I
[1:31:30] wonder if they know who they're standing
[1:31:33] next to I'm a Son of
[1:31:40] God Amen who are you sons of God
[1:31:44] Daughters of God I liked how the brother
[1:31:47] was getting in there and
[1:31:50] you I like that story of Satan tempting
[1:31:53] Jesus and he like he was saying and he
[1:31:55] tempts him this way and he tempts him
[1:31:57] that way and he tempts him like this and
[1:32:00] finally Jesus got enough of
[1:32:03] it right remember the scripture tells us
[1:32:07] let this mind that was in Christ being
[1:32:11] in
[1:32:14] you in the form of man thought it what
[1:32:18] not robbery to be
[1:32:20] what
[1:32:22] equal with
[1:32:26] God you know if you look it up brother
[1:32:28] brand said the only difference between
[1:32:30] Jesus and
[1:32:32] us Jesus believed who he
[1:32:38] was all right I love that scripture and
[1:32:41] finally he got tired of it got tired of
[1:32:45] Satan tempting him and he turned to
[1:32:48] Satan he said Satan it is written
[1:32:52] Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[1:32:57] God why because he knew who he was do we
[1:33:01] know who we
[1:33:05] are amen our communion
[1:33:08] scripture I love that many are sick
[1:33:12] among us not just naturally but
[1:33:14] physically why because we don't discern
[1:33:18] the body of the
[1:33:20] Lord right
[1:33:22] and I always like to give the example
[1:33:24] you know who likes to touch go who wants
[1:33:26] to touch God tonight raise your hands
[1:33:28] and every raise their hands no keep your
[1:33:30] hand up keep your hand
[1:33:32] up if you really want to touch God
[1:33:34] tonight just reach over and touch God
[1:33:39] because we are his body that's right we
[1:33:42] are his body that's who we
[1:33:46] are right the things brother Brown told
[1:33:48] us that was left undone when he was here
[1:33:51] we are are to
[1:33:53] fulfill yes sir amen
[1:33:57] okay so I tell you friends just what
[1:34:00] that we are members of the church or
[1:34:02] something like that doesn't mean too
[1:34:03] much to us you better buckle up that
[1:34:05] armor you better take the whole word of
[1:34:07] God and hold on to it and quit this
[1:34:09] Hollywood acting around here it's got
[1:34:10] right into the church and it's a shame
[1:34:13] Hollywood glows just makes a bright
[1:34:14] light and the church today is trying to
[1:34:16] compare with Hollywood Christ is not in
[1:34:19] Hollywood Christ is in the individual
[1:34:21] Hollywood glares while the gospel glows
[1:34:23] with humility God ain't in these great
[1:34:26] fine fancy places and all this stuff
[1:34:28] that we see he comes in the form of
[1:34:30] humility the form of meekness and
[1:34:33] gentleness and pass right through and if
[1:34:36] you're acquainted with the word you'll
[1:34:40] see it are you acquainted with the word
[1:34:44] what
[1:34:45] word the open
[1:34:48] word the open book not the closed book
[1:34:52] yeah the open
[1:34:54] word you have to be acquainted with the
[1:34:59] message right think about it brother
[1:35:03] brandom told us that he knew all
[1:35:06] along that the healings and the
[1:35:08] discernments was not his
[1:35:12] message his message was what the opening
[1:35:15] of the seals the opening of the word
[1:35:17] that was the seventh Angel's message
[1:35:22] but Satan doesn't want people to know
[1:35:24] that can I read you something out of the
[1:35:26] church age book okay
[1:35:29] good it's on page 375 brother bram's
[1:35:32] talking about the
[1:35:35] uh Philadelphia Church
[1:35:39] age and he says
[1:35:43] that the true church couldn't bring the
[1:35:45] false church back neither could the
[1:35:47] false Church get into the F to overcome
[1:35:51] the true church he says
[1:35:53] but the false Vine entrenched itself
[1:35:57] waiting for the last part of the last
[1:36:01] age when it would win all back to ex
[1:36:05] except that small flock that were the
[1:36:07] elect True Vine of God look up that word
[1:36:12] entrenched always started to do that
[1:36:14] when brother Brown says not all our
[1:36:15] English words mean what you think it
[1:36:18] means because and we're that way we get
[1:36:20] thinking a word means something and you
[1:36:22] look up the word and you're like wow I
[1:36:23] was way
[1:36:25] off right you know we think entrenched
[1:36:27] I'm going to dig a hole and I'm going to
[1:36:29] put something in
[1:36:30] it but that word entrench means to
[1:36:34] place someone or something in a very
[1:36:38] strong
[1:36:39] position that cannot be easily
[1:36:43] changed yeah and that's what Satan did
[1:36:46] at the beginning when God came and he
[1:36:48] started pulling all of those believers
[1:36:51] out of
[1:36:53] the Pentecostal Church age Satan got in
[1:36:57] there and started putting men in there
[1:36:59] and they he raised them up in
[1:37:05] positions of
[1:37:09] power How could a
[1:37:11] br How could a preacher that believes
[1:37:14] this message tell you that God opened
[1:37:17] the
[1:37:18] book then he closed it again
[1:37:22] but why would
[1:37:23] God open something and then close
[1:37:26] it he ain't going to do that why he sent
[1:37:31] a prophet to tell you something so what
[1:37:34] do they
[1:37:35] do they try to hold the
[1:37:40] people
[1:37:42] back from believing brother Bram says
[1:37:45] here what was it it's the blind leading
[1:37:47] the blind they won't come in neither
[1:37:50] will they let them that's under them
[1:37:53] come
[1:37:56] in you think it's God that doesn't want
[1:37:59] you to know that the book is
[1:38:02] open that's the
[1:38:05] truth it it it's not God wants you to
[1:38:08] know that's why he opened the word for
[1:38:10] you to know and I know that because you
[1:38:13] guys believe the open word it's not like
[1:38:15] you're out somewhere trying to tell
[1:38:16] these guys hey come come up higher you
[1:38:18] know the spirit says come up higher come
[1:38:20] up higher not stay down here but you go
[1:38:24] to these churches I've been to these
[1:38:26] churches and they don't want the people
[1:38:28] why would you not want the people to
[1:38:32] know right they get trained you know how
[1:38:34] they train an
[1:38:36] elephant they take him when he's a
[1:38:39] baby and they tie him with a chain or a
[1:38:42] big rope to a
[1:38:43] post and this
[1:38:47] elephant he gets out there when he gets
[1:38:49] to he when he's a baby he gets the end
[1:38:51] and he can't get
[1:38:54] away but they say when that elephant's a
[1:38:57] full grown
[1:38:58] elephant that what he could pull that
[1:39:02] post out of the ground like that but
[1:39:04] he's been
[1:39:07] trained not that he can't go no farther
[1:39:12] than
[1:39:16] that amen as we were saying earlier
[1:39:20] there's so many that come over here and
[1:39:23] only point to the
[1:39:25] signpost
[1:39:27] yeah well if you believe God sent a
[1:39:29] prophet you're all
[1:39:30] right that's all you have to believe
[1:39:33] I've heard it in my own ears just come
[1:39:34] to church we'll feed you
[1:39:36] lunch well that's not what church is
[1:39:38] about coming to feed you
[1:39:41] lunch the the church is about what
[1:39:44] dressing his bride to be
[1:39:48] ready for the wedding supper amen that's
[1:39:52] why this word was
[1:39:54] opened to be to dress Us in what he
[1:39:58] wants not what we want or what we
[1:40:02] think that's why I like the story of
[1:40:06] Esther right all the virgins were
[1:40:09] called and he called them all
[1:40:12] together and then he put his Chamberlain
[1:40:15] over him which we know Esther's was
[1:40:19] Hagi and what did I have he had access
[1:40:23] to where he spoke lip to ear with the
[1:40:27] king and the King told hegi what he
[1:40:32] expects from his
[1:40:38] Queen
[1:40:40] amen what he expects from his king
[1:40:44] queen and all the other all the other
[1:40:47] virgins they were
[1:40:49] virgins
[1:40:52] they all had their own idea they had
[1:40:55] their own thoughts oh maybe you know I
[1:40:58] like red so I'm going to put the red hat
[1:41:00] on and I'm going to do this I'm going to
[1:41:02] make myself up this
[1:41:04] way oh I like it this way and I like the
[1:41:08] big you understand what I'm saying they
[1:41:11] put their own thoughts to what hey was
[1:41:15] trying to tell
[1:41:16] them so when it was their turn to come
[1:41:19] before the king
[1:41:22] what happened they were
[1:41:25] rejected but if you read it they weren't
[1:41:27] put
[1:41:29] out and just thrown onto the street but
[1:41:32] they were put in the second
[1:41:36] house but there was one who
[1:41:40] listened and did exactly what hegi told
[1:41:44] him to
[1:41:46] do right we've had our hegy
[1:41:49] today
[1:41:51] amen I go into places and I look out
[1:41:54] there and all I see is
[1:41:57] Christians I look out there and I think
[1:41:59] man you guys know more than I know I
[1:42:01] don't know
[1:42:03] anything and then I started putting
[1:42:06] together because the natural types the
[1:42:09] spiritual
[1:42:12] right so in the natural as we were
[1:42:15] saying brother brandham said God what we
[1:42:19] are Sons and Daughters now
[1:42:21] we always were we always will
[1:42:23] be right now I like to do this when some
[1:42:28] of my children are
[1:42:30] here but you think about it you take
[1:42:32] your
[1:42:34] children and you can do a blood
[1:42:37] test right they can prick the fingers
[1:42:41] and put your thing out there and they'll
[1:42:43] come back no matter how much they don't
[1:42:45] want to be your child
[1:42:48] anymore but it'll come back says no I'm
[1:42:51] sorry but yeah raise your
[1:42:53] father what oh
[1:42:57] man but just cuz I have kids tell
[1:43:03] me right there's no getting around
[1:43:06] it ra you know I'm I'm their father
[1:43:10] because the blood test tells it they'll
[1:43:11] never get away and that's how we are
[1:43:14] brothers and
[1:43:15] sisters take the blood test you're a
[1:43:18] child of God you are a son and daughter
[1:43:22] of
[1:43:23] God but
[1:43:26] now there's a
[1:43:29] difference my
[1:43:31] wife now my wife is closer to me than
[1:43:35] All My
[1:43:38] Children right I don't wouldn't let my
[1:43:40] kids run all over my wife she's my wife
[1:43:43] come on she's supposed to be part of
[1:43:46] me but as a wife if you go into
[1:43:51] invisible Union brother Brown talks
[1:43:53] about it but she has certain things that
[1:43:58] she has to do and can't
[1:44:03] do if she breaks brother Brown says
[1:44:06] breaks those virtues are
[1:44:08] something she ceases to be your
[1:44:12] wife but you can come and she could go
[1:44:14] oh but that's my husband I'm part of
[1:44:16] that well take a blood
[1:44:19] test
[1:44:22] you see Esther had certain things that
[1:44:23] she had to
[1:44:25] do to prove that she was the
[1:44:29] wife amen that's how we are as the bride
[1:44:34] we have certain things certain things
[1:44:36] that God has for us that we are supposed
[1:44:41] to do that we are supposed to
[1:44:45] manifest and if we break those things
[1:44:48] it's not that you don't go to heaven
[1:44:51] you're Sons and Daughters of
[1:44:53] God you you've you you were already
[1:44:56] there and I'm not even going to say
[1:44:57] you've already made it you're just going
[1:44:59] back to from what you came
[1:45:02] from amen but God is expecting certain
[1:45:07] things from those that call the wife
[1:45:11] okay amen because the naturals du type
[1:45:14] if he's a father we can look and see how
[1:45:18] he treats his children we should treat
[1:45:20] it that way way we can look and see how
[1:45:22] as a husband how he treats we can look
[1:45:24] in the Bible and see what he does
[1:45:27] to wives that are not
[1:45:31] faithful amen and I just want to be
[1:45:34] faithful and I'm glad that God gave me
[1:45:36] an ear to
[1:45:38] hear what the spirit has
[1:45:41] said that I know what God is
[1:45:45] expecting from me why because I heard
[1:45:48] what he gu said and I'm going to do what
[1:45:50] that guy
[1:45:51] says oh here's that
[1:46:03] is so what happened then brother brand
[1:46:06] says and according to the scriptures
[1:46:07] there has got to be another church age
[1:46:09] rais and when it did the Philadelphia
[1:46:12] Church age rais John Wesley and what had
[1:46:14] happened kept coming Westward all the
[1:46:16] time and when it happened there was the
[1:46:18] church agent John Wesley raised up but
[1:46:21] Luther could not receive it because they
[1:46:24] had already organized to
[1:46:26] justification he could not accept
[1:46:29] sanctification and what happened in our
[1:46:32] day the people accepted the prophets
[1:46:35] signs and
[1:46:37] wonders but not the prophet's
[1:46:41] message what happened they already had
[1:46:43] these coming out had already organized
[1:46:47] who God sent a prophet not what was the
[1:46:51] prophet's
[1:46:53] message so when they came they couldn't
[1:46:56] this just like I always wonder people
[1:46:58] are expecting the prophet to come
[1:47:01] back I don't think they want him to come
[1:47:03] back not the way they're
[1:47:05] thinking just listen to the message the
[1:47:08] way of a true Prophet I just think of
[1:47:10] that how brother Bram talks about Amos
[1:47:12] coming up over the hill and when he
[1:47:13] started to look out there and seeing
[1:47:15] what his message had
[1:47:17] become his eyes turned to fire
[1:47:25] yeah they don't want him oh let me read
[1:47:28] this to
[1:47:29] you he says not for one moment do I
[1:47:32] bring a message to the people that they
[1:47:34] may follow me or join my church or start
[1:47:36] some fellowship and organization I've
[1:47:38] never done that and will not do that now
[1:47:40] I have no interest in those things but I
[1:47:42] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:47:44] and people and if I can accomplish just
[1:47:47] one thing I will be satisfied that one
[1:47:50] thing is to see established a true
[1:47:53] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:47:58] Men amen and that should be the whole
[1:48:02] focus of the
[1:48:04] ministry it's not to build ourselves up
[1:48:06] not to build our church up not to build
[1:48:09] some organization up but what to build
[1:48:11] the people up to get them into that real
[1:48:15] spiritual relationship
[1:48:18] amen that's what if he did that then
[1:48:21] that's what I should be doing like
[1:48:23] brother Ram said about Paul he said
[1:48:25] every Minister should we might not get
[1:48:28] there but everyone should look back and
[1:48:30] try to be like Paul was and what was
[1:48:34] Paul he was a prisoner to this
[1:48:38] word and that's what we want to see you
[1:48:42] know your pastor would have a lot easier
[1:48:47] time if we could just get that
[1:48:49] relationship between between us and God
[1:48:52] that's right and we go to God before we
[1:48:55] go to the
[1:48:58] pastor and that's what God wants is he
[1:49:01] wants you to come to him you to believe
[1:49:04] his word you to
[1:49:08] do I feel sorry for the pastors I'm glad
[1:49:12] I'm not a
[1:49:13] pastor they have a hard
[1:49:16] job yeah I mean you think you you got a
[1:49:20] bunch of problems and then multiply that
[1:49:22] by the next guy and the next guy and the
[1:49:24] next
[1:49:25] guy and you lay that all upon
[1:49:28] him instead of going to
[1:49:31] God right I don't expect my wife to call
[1:49:35] her brother or friend to talk to me I
[1:49:38] expect my wife to come and talk to
[1:49:41] me God's the same way he's expecting us
[1:49:44] to go to come to
[1:49:47] him
[1:49:49] amen
[1:49:52] okay he says you're not blind people
[1:49:56] you're sensible people and as I stood
[1:49:57] there and said those things for
[1:49:59] prejudice I say it's because it's life
[1:50:01] because I'm responsible to God for
[1:50:03] saying it and I must say it and my
[1:50:05] message all the time knowing back there
[1:50:09] under healing and so forth like that was
[1:50:11] just to catch the people's attention
[1:50:13] knowing the message would come and here
[1:50:15] it is and them Seven Seals
[1:50:18] opened those Mysteries and showing those
[1:50:21] things is what's
[1:50:23] happened
[1:50:25] amen so brother brandom knew all the
[1:50:27] time that he was coming up doing the
[1:50:29] work of an evangelist that wasn't his
[1:50:31] message his message was the opening of
[1:50:35] the seals his message was the word being
[1:50:39] open the sword in the hand that he could
[1:50:43] come and tell us but the king
[1:50:46] said amen that's what the whole message
[1:50:50] is
[1:50:50] about God trying to speak to each
[1:50:55] individual I like how brother brandom
[1:50:57] says God gives the orders and you pack
[1:50:59] them
[1:51:02] out God speaks to you we need to do what
[1:51:05] God tells us to
[1:51:07] do not be
[1:51:10] indecisive God gives us the orders we
[1:51:14] pack them
[1:51:18] out one of my favorite
[1:51:21] quotes he says Christ was the first one
[1:51:24] to raise from all the prophets and so
[1:51:26] forth although typed in many places he
[1:51:29] was the first fruit of those that slept
[1:51:31] and the bride coming of Christ coming
[1:51:33] out of the church there'll be a sheath
[1:51:35] waved again in the last days oh my
[1:51:38] waving of the sheath yes what was the
[1:51:41] sheath the first one to come to mature
[1:51:44] the first one that proved it was wheat
[1:51:46] that proved it was a sheath so we know
[1:51:50] that Christ when he was F when he came
[1:51:52] as brother Bram saying when he came and
[1:51:54] he rose again he
[1:51:57] was showing like the brother was talking
[1:52:00] about job I like that he was showing
[1:52:03] that death can't hold you yeah he was
[1:52:06] showing that death is nothing like but a
[1:52:09] vehicle to take us to where we want to
[1:52:12] go always like that and I you know we we
[1:52:16] grieve over somebody that left and died
[1:52:19] but you know what I bet you if you talk
[1:52:20] to her today she don't want to come
[1:52:24] back I mean we should be happy that they
[1:52:27] got to go over there before us we should
[1:52:31] be jealous that they got to go over
[1:52:33] there always in my mind in brother
[1:52:35] Brown's first wife died and he's sitting
[1:52:37] there talking she had little
[1:52:39] kids she had a baby and what Billy Paul
[1:52:42] was 18 months old and you know how
[1:52:44] mothers are with little
[1:52:46] kids and she did not want to come back
[1:52:49] say B why'd you call me back everything
[1:52:52] you talked about
[1:52:55] yeah okay oh man it's even more than we
[1:52:59] could
[1:53:00] think it's even more than we can think
[1:53:04] so we found in our day I like the wave
[1:53:07] sheath the the thing about the wave
[1:53:10] sheath that they would look out there
[1:53:11] the priests would look out there and
[1:53:15] there'd be a little corner of the the
[1:53:17] wheat field that would come to mature
[1:53:20] first to show what a mature
[1:53:24] wheat was supposed to be and what it was
[1:53:26] supposed to look
[1:53:28] like and they would do what they would
[1:53:30] take the
[1:53:32] wheat and wave it over the
[1:53:35] people to say when your
[1:53:37] crop looks like this it's ready for
[1:53:41] Harvest all right and that's what we as
[1:53:44] ministers are supposed to do we are
[1:53:47] supposed to take the message and say
[1:53:50] this is what a Christian looks like this
[1:53:53] is what a Christian does and wave it
[1:53:55] over the people to know that when we
[1:53:58] become
[1:54:01] that it's time for the
[1:54:05] Harvest it's time for the Harvest I'm
[1:54:09] I'm ready to get out of
[1:54:12] here I'm tired of being
[1:54:15] here you know it's like everybody says
[1:54:17] and you listen to them and you know when
[1:54:19] I first came in I didn't think my kids
[1:54:21] would have to go the Rapture was going
[1:54:22] to happen and man now it's 35 plus years
[1:54:27] later you know like brother Brown said
[1:54:30] about Israel aren't they tired of going
[1:54:32] around the mountain going around the
[1:54:34] mountain going around the mountain going
[1:54:37] around the mountain it's time to go
[1:54:41] home I'm just one that believes like
[1:54:43] brother Bram says you know well we're
[1:54:46] waiting on Jesus but Jesus is waiting on
[1:54:48] us
[1:54:50] many many times brother brandom said the
[1:54:52] Rapture should have already taken place
[1:54:55] all
[1:54:58] right what is hindering
[1:55:01] us what is hindering
[1:55:05] us you say that last one to come in but
[1:55:09] how do you know the last one isn't one
[1:55:10] of
[1:55:13] these right I I I love kids I have a a
[1:55:18] heart for kids cuz how do you know it's
[1:55:19] not this young guy here in the gray
[1:55:22] shirt what if he's the last
[1:55:26] one what if he's the last one you're
[1:55:29] smiling are you the last one okay hurry
[1:55:32] up we want to go home come on come
[1:55:36] on Amen I am ready to go
[1:55:41] home there should be nothing tying us to
[1:55:45] this
[1:55:47] world right but we get ourselves B
[1:55:49] bolted down too much you ever think
[1:55:52] about that story we sound as good you
[1:55:54] know oh yeah the magnet's going to come
[1:55:55] by and but there's some that are still
[1:55:58] bolted down that shouldn't be bolted
[1:56:00] down to this world that's right and like
[1:56:05] the scripture says that God's only
[1:56:07] longsuffering for a certain amount of
[1:56:09] time yeah and then him that's filthy
[1:56:12] will be filthy still him that's holy
[1:56:14] will be holy still we need to unbolt
[1:56:17] ourselves from this world there should
[1:56:19] be nothing in this world more
[1:56:21] important than going
[1:56:24] home you know as I always tell people
[1:56:26] for me I'm the worst person for
[1:56:29] things what do we need things
[1:56:31] for oh I needed a new boat because I
[1:56:34] like to go fishing why well I needed a
[1:56:37] motor home because I don't want to camp
[1:56:38] in a tent
[1:56:42] why right why do we need these
[1:56:48] things brother brand said you know well
[1:56:51] the Bible says in the beginning they did
[1:56:53] what they sold everything they have to
[1:56:59] follow I know you're like what I
[1:57:02] don't but we should have that
[1:57:07] attitude it's not wrong to have things
[1:57:11] but if things is the
[1:57:13] thing that you are going after that's
[1:57:16] what's
[1:57:17] wrong right
[1:57:20] whatever God wants to give us that's
[1:57:21] what we want but things is is to me is
[1:57:24] holding us back because we got to have
[1:57:26] this thing and that thing and if I can
[1:57:28] just oh wait till my next vacation's
[1:57:30] over before you come
[1:57:33] Lord I tell you
[1:57:36] what I'd rather vacation over there than
[1:57:40] vacation
[1:57:42] here that's where we want to be is on
[1:57:45] the other side amen let's stand
[1:57:52] what's that song when I take my vacation
[1:57:55] in
[1:57:58] heaven that's better than any Cruise you
[1:58:00] could go on even to tell people man take
[1:58:03] a cruise to Alaska it's better than
[1:58:09] that
[1:58:11] it aren't you tired of being here it
[1:58:15] sounds good but we we need to I think
[1:58:17] start moving that way hey Lord I'm
[1:58:20] tired because remember God sent
[1:58:23] Moses and I believe that it was when God
[1:58:27] does
[1:58:28] something it's time for something to
[1:58:31] happen God sent Moses to deliver
[1:58:35] Israel but what the unbelief of the
[1:58:38] people had to wait 40 more
[1:58:41] years to be
[1:58:43] delivered and then brother Brown said it
[1:58:46] wasn't until the people started crying
[1:58:50] out to God for
[1:58:53] deliverance I think it's time we need to
[1:58:55] start saying God I'm tired of this
[1:58:58] place you know let's oh God pay my bill
[1:59:01] forget that say god let's get us out of
[1:59:03] here and then you won't have to worry
[1:59:05] about your
[1:59:07] bills cuz you won't be
[1:59:11] here I want to go
[1:59:14] home you know maybe you just think oh
[1:59:16] you're just old and you're thinking that
[1:59:18] well no I wanted to go home a long time
[1:59:20] ago I was ready to go home I said well I
[1:59:23] got my whole life ahead no you don't you
[1:59:25] got all of eternity ahead of you that's
[1:59:28] your life this isn't your life come on
[1:59:33] you might think it's your life but it's
[1:59:35] not we're supposed to what give our life
[1:59:38] to him to live his life through
[1:59:41] us you see I think
[1:59:44] that's not here I'm just talking
[1:59:48] generally that's one of the
[1:59:52] things brother brandom said as
[1:59:54] Christians we are what supposed to
[1:59:58] reflect the the spirit of the world of
[2:00:02] our
[2:00:03] rebirth in other words when you're born
[2:00:06] again it's from somewhere else we're not
[2:00:09] born again from this world we're born
[2:00:13] again from
[2:00:15] heaven we should reflect the things in
[2:00:19] in
[2:00:20] heaven many of the things that are here
[2:00:23] probably 99.9% of them are not going to
[2:00:26] be in
[2:00:29] heaven not going to be in
[2:00:32] heaven father as we come before
[2:00:36] you we know sometimes
[2:00:48] father
[2:00:50] things just don't come the way we would
[2:00:53] think as preachers
[2:01:00] father but we have to believe that you
[2:01:02] will direct your
[2:01:04] word to each
[2:01:09] heart for what they
[2:01:12] need for the day that we live
[2:01:16] in and father we know you Senter Prophet
[2:01:19] for a
[2:01:22] reason and we know he told us it was to
[2:01:24] dress the bride with this
[2:01:28] word and we as your ministry Lord are
[2:01:32] to take this
[2:01:35] word give it to the people father that
[2:01:39] they could be dressed
[2:01:40] for your
[2:01:46] coming the duty of us as ministers
[2:01:51] father not to lift ourselves
[2:01:55] up not to make us of some great ministry
[2:02:01] father but it's to lift you up before
[2:02:03] the
[2:02:05] people that they would see you father
[2:02:09] and you did this Lord by opening your
[2:02:11] word to
[2:02:14] us so I always wonder what book are most
[2:02:18] people reading out
[2:02:22] of do we look at things through the open
[2:02:27] word or are we still looking at the
[2:02:29] signpost wondering where we're
[2:02:32] going how long we're going to be to get
[2:02:39] there and we know father that the
[2:02:42] Rapture cycle has already started
[2:02:47] Lord just want to be
[2:02:52] ready the things that you told hegi to
[2:02:56] tell us
[2:02:58] Lord that's what we want to be
[2:03:01] father we want to do those things we
[2:03:05] want to be found
[2:03:09] ready as he said
[2:03:12] to be presented before you as a Chase
[2:03:17] virgin and we have no Creeds or dogmas
[2:03:21] or
[2:03:21] anything attached father but it's just
[2:03:24] this word that you've revealed to
[2:03:27] us how thankful we are Lord that you
[2:03:30] have given us ears to
[2:03:32] hear and not only that father but you've
[2:03:34] given us an understanding you've given
[2:03:37] us a heart father
[2:03:41] to want to serve
[2:03:45] you and help us Lord as we go forward to
[2:03:49] Endeavor more as the brother said we
[2:03:51] need this
[2:03:54] morning to get back to our first love
[2:03:57] the way that we were when you
[2:03:59] first revealed yourself to
[2:04:02] us have that Zeal as the young ones do
[2:04:08] father being old we should never lose
[2:04:12] that
[2:04:17] Zeal just help us Lord we know time is
[2:04:20] short we want to be ready
[2:04:26] Lord all of us here father we don't come
[2:04:29] because we don't want to be ready I
[2:04:30] don't believe anybody here comes because
[2:04:32] they just want to be
[2:04:35] seen but they come to hear from
[2:04:40] you that we would be
[2:04:43] changed into that
[2:04:47] image just love you
[2:04:52] father just be with my brothers and
[2:04:54] sisters here
[2:04:56] Lord we just appreciate brother Wendell
[2:04:59] so much just pray you just continue
[2:05:02] father anoint his
[2:05:05] ministry to get the people Lord ready
[2:05:07] and prepared
[2:05:12] father for we know it's going to that
[2:05:15] change is in the moment and the
[2:05:16] twinkling of the eye
[2:05:20] Love You Lord appreciate you and we
[2:05:24] thank you that we had this
[2:05:28] time just help us now Lord to go through
[2:05:31] and go forth
[2:05:33] and let's remember these things we've
[2:05:36] heard today
[2:05:38] father let us dwell on them
[2:05:41] Lord draw closer to
[2:05:45] you we ask it in Jesus name
[2:05:51] amen oh how I just want to be like
[2:05:56] God and it's
[2:05:59] possible you know I always think if
[2:06:02] brother Brandon was our wave sheep to
[2:06:04] show and we know we're not talking about
[2:06:06] the gift that he had that comes once to
[2:06:09] an age but he's talking about the life
[2:06:13] that brother brandom
[2:06:15] lived we can live that life that same
[2:06:17] life because it's the same holy
[2:06:21] spirit
[2:06:24] amen Same Spirit that anointed him to
[2:06:27] live the life anoints
[2:06:31] us I know it sounds crazy but I always
[2:06:34] wonder when was the last
[2:06:36] time somebody mistakened you for Jesus
[2:06:40] Christ do you live that kind of a life
[2:06:42] before the
[2:06:44] people you say it's impossible it's not
[2:06:47] impossible
[2:06:49] because if his Spirit dwells in
[2:06:53] you and you've allowed him to have
[2:06:56] preeminence in your life then that
[2:06:59] spirit will live through you it's like
[2:07:03] brother Brown said if Dillinger was in
[2:07:07] you you would rob
[2:07:09] banks right if some great artist
[2:07:12] Michelangelo was in you you would paint
[2:07:16] paintings you would make sculptures
[2:07:19] well how about if Jesus Christ lives in
[2:07:23] you the works that I do you shall do
[2:07:26] also amen God bless
[2:07:32] [Applause]
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:47] you
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:52] is
[2:07:54] to
[2:07:56] [Music]
[2:07:59] the be at his will in every
[2:08:08] way in his
[2:08:11] presence
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:15] found hear say what
[2:08:21] oh yes my
[2:08:23] Lord I just want to
[2:08:28] please the
[2:08:32] Lord be in his will in every
[2:08:37] way to be
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:47] lost to hear him say Well
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:54] done
[2:08:55] hallelujah I'm so glad that God come to
[2:08:58] open the
[2:09:02] book I like when brother uh brother
[2:09:07] Craig Bo had come to minister and
[2:09:11] someone had asked him
[2:09:12] something a visitor had asked
[2:09:16] about you know what what's his stand on
[2:09:18] the message and
[2:09:20] um and he's you know um do you believe
[2:09:25] that the Bible I he she says I believe
[2:09:28] the Bible will get me home and and um
[2:09:32] and then we just read we just read the
[2:09:34] the good things that the prophet said
[2:09:36] and and uh she says so isn't that right
[2:09:39] do you are you believe you have to
[2:09:43] believe the message or believe the Bible
[2:09:46] and and I'd like to say I liked his
[2:09:49] response his his response was he says
[2:09:52] well do you want an open book or do you
[2:09:54] want a closed
[2:09:56] book and uh he says if you want a closed
[2:10:01] book then just go ahead and read your
[2:10:03] Bible and don't worry about the
[2:10:05] prophet's
[2:10:07] message but if you want an open book if
[2:10:10] you want to understand what this book
[2:10:12] says well you might want to go ahead and
[2:10:14] listen to the
[2:10:17] prophet so those guys that's always
[2:10:19] trying to separate this message and the
[2:10:22] Bible and trying to make it two
[2:10:24] different Deals they they first of all
[2:10:26] they have no understanding of an open
[2:10:28] book they have no understanding of what
[2:10:31] the seals were all about they're all
[2:10:34] still back in the first and the second
[2:10:35] pools and and uh and the Miracles and
[2:10:39] things like that the Miracles and the
[2:10:42] healings and the
[2:10:44] discernments thankful for them but they
[2:10:47] have zero zal effect upon my belief
[2:10:50] system my belief system is that God sent
[2:10:54] us a prophet and those words of Life
[2:10:58] have so affected me and so changed
[2:11:03] me can you say
[2:11:05] amen amen so when you get a proper
[2:11:09] revelation of the message the message
[2:11:13] and the the Bible it's all combined
[2:11:15] you'll never separate it and when you
[2:11:18] get a proper revelation of that you'll
[2:11:20] never separate Jesus from his word it's
[2:11:23] all the same aren't you glad for
[2:11:27] that
[2:11:30] Hallelujah the prophet never tried to
