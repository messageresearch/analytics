[38:26] the the
[38:27] revelation of how where the church is

[39:08] candlesticks the Seven Stars are the
[39:11] seven angels of the seven churches

[39:21] go to the Lord in prayer father we want
[39:23] to thank you for for your grace and your
[39:26] your love to us
[39:28] for your help Lord to the families who
[39:31] have
[39:32] Lord lost their loved ones and while one
[39:35] was a wonderful homecoming Lord of a
[39:39] Dear Old Saint Who had who had lived the
[39:42] life and reflected Your Grace here on
[39:45] the earth Lord
[39:47] there's another one Lord with a family
[39:49] that is grieving and Lord and fighting
[39:53] hurt and anger and pain and
[39:57] I pray God that you'll be with them Lord

[40:17] I pray Lord that you would be with us

[40:26] midst and that you would speak to us
[40:28] father as our prayer we love you Lord
[40:30] with all of our heart
[40:32] can the Church Say Amen
[40:35] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[40:39] amen we're thankful for the name of
[40:42] Jesus
[40:43] I want to speak up just um I'm just
[40:47] going to take my time a little bit this
[40:48] morning and and deal with a real simple
[40:52] subject and that is amen the The
[40:55] Messengers of God's prophets
[40:59] God's voice amen and and I want to deal
[41:04] with the importance a man of of uh this
[41:08] of this church that we uh God's church
[41:12] that we are a part of Amen the scripture
[41:16] uh tells us that all the Bible all the
[41:21] scripture there in second Timothy 3 and
[41:22] 16. all scripture is given by
[41:27] inspiration of God and it's profitable
[41:30] for Doctrine for reproof for correction
[41:35] for instruction in righteousness so the
[41:39] Bible amen this this Canon of scripture
[41:42] is is uh inspired of God anointed men of
[41:48] God now it's easy for us to look at the
[41:51] scripture as
[41:55] I believe her in any any sound Bible
[41:57] believer believes that the Bible there
[42:00] is no error in this Bible
[42:02] do you believe that no error in this
[42:05] Bible amen and and that God put this
[42:08] together amen and nothing can be added
[42:11] to this Bible and nothing can be taken
[42:14] away from this Bible this is the
[42:17] complete revelation of God amen there's
[42:21] no no other Revelation you you can't
[42:23] amen any no any other Revelation outside
[42:27] of the revelation of of what God has
[42:30] placed in this Bible a man is is is the
[42:34] affigmund of man's imagination and so
[42:37] therefore we cannot take
[42:39] um anything that that uh that Mormon
[42:42] brought or the Maccabee brothers or that
[42:45] any of these others that would bring
[42:46] amen because their teachings do not line
[42:50] up with the Bible so therefore we cannot
[42:54] accept that as as the uh uh
[42:58] authoritative word of God Amen we cannot
[43:01] take uh uh you know Muhammad we can't
[43:04] take any of these other other men who
[43:08] have come in and tried to uh add an
[43:12] addition to the Bible there's only
[43:14] there's only one Bible we believe that
[43:16] God put these 66 books right here and we
[43:21] believe what that word teaches us amen
[43:24] now we uh but what we do realize amen is
[43:30] that or what we sometimes Overlook is
[43:34] that these were men mortal men just like
[43:39] you are amen that that that that that
[43:41] had to to to work they had to uh uh they
[43:46] had families they were mortal men who
[43:50] who was born and who died they were
[43:54] Sinners that had to be Redeemed by God
[43:57] but they were anointed men who were set
[44:01] aside for a specific purpose and that
[44:05] was to be the mouthpiece of God to their
[44:08] generation amen and to the Future
[44:10] Generations that were to come can you
[44:13] say amen and and so amen but and the but
[44:17] the scripture says they're in second
[44:19] Peter 1 and 20 knowing this first that
[44:23] no private a prophecy of the scripture
[44:26] is of any private interpretation for the
[44:30] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[44:32] will of man but holy men of God spake as
[44:37] they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen
[44:41] so God would take a mortal man and he
[44:45] would play Separate him first of all he
[44:48] would separate him to himself they were
[44:51] born prophets of God and God would come
[44:55] down and would anoint them and use them
[45:00] in in his kingdom now amen the scripture
[45:04] uh tells a lot about these about what
[45:07] God thinks about these prophets they're
[45:09] in Ephesians 2 and 20. it says you are
[45:12] built upon the foundation of the
[45:15] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[45:18] himself being the chief corner uh it's
[45:21] Cornerstone amen they're in second Peter
[45:23] three and two it says that ye may be
[45:25] mindful of The Words which were spoken
[45:27] before by the holy prophets and the
[45:31] Commandment of us the Apostles of the
[45:33] Lord and Savior there in Revelations 22
[45:36] and 6 and he said unto them these
[45:38] sayings are faithful and true and the
[45:40] Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his
[45:44] Angel to show unto his servants the
[45:46] things which must shortly come to pass
[45:49] so so we we we see that when God places
[45:54] his anointing upon a man and causes him
[45:58] uh to prophesy he he is Anointed of God
[46:02] his words become the words of God to
[46:07] that generation amen now is that man a
[46:10] failure in in by birth absolutely the
[46:15] man is a failure at Birth the man is
[46:17] Immortal the man makes mistakes the man
[46:20] is he is is going to there's going to be
[46:23] plenty of times where God comes in and
[46:25] has to say hey amen I I told you to do
[46:29] this and you've done that Moses was not
[46:31] even allowed to go into the promised
[46:33] land amen and and yet the Bible says
[46:37] that God spoke lip to ear with Moses so
[46:42] so so we we yes God's using mortal men
[46:47] but their words are divine
[46:52] their words are set in stone forever
[46:57] throughout the eternities and you will
[47:00] be judged by the words of the Divine
[47:03] words that came through those mortal men
[47:06] can you say amen amen now so when we
[47:10] look at the scripture today we are
[47:13] believing that God can keep his work
[47:17] aren't you glad that God can do that
[47:19] that God can so take a man and so anoint
[47:24] him and and and and so trust those words
[47:29] that he would build his church upon the
[47:32] Revelation that comes amen forth out of
[47:35] their mouth now another thing that I
[47:37] want to look at for prophets God always
[47:41] sins a messenger at the junction of time
[47:46] now now I want to I want us to look here
[47:48] for a minute God always sends his
[47:51] prophets right where there's fixing to
[47:54] be amen a junction or right when there's
[47:57] fixing to be a change right when there's
[47:59] fixing to be something take place God
[48:02] will send his Prophet to come in amen
[48:05] and to show us the way listen take that
[48:09] road not that one not that one not that
[48:13] one this is the way
[48:16] Hallelujah now you say now now now now
[48:19] why can't God send Angels he does send
[48:21] his angels to His prophets
[48:24] and um us mortal beings must be
[48:29] spiritual enough to know who God is with
[48:33] and be willing to follow another mortal
[48:36] man
[48:38] well praise the Lord mortal men have
[48:41] problems following mortal men
[48:44] amen more Mortal me I have problems
[48:48] following another man and we're not to
[48:51] follow the man God vindicates that man
[48:55] to be his Prophet by never letting his
[49:00] words fall to the ground his prophecies
[49:05] are true and the scripture says there
[49:07] Amen in in the in the book of
[49:10] Deuteronomy if a man were to rise up and
[49:13] to prophesy and his words come to pass
[49:17] then believe what that man is saying
[49:22] why God vindicates God's will always
[49:27] vindicate his prophet
[49:31] amen now amen so he sends these men he
[49:36] will raise them up they are born with
[49:39] these gifts in their heart amen and
[49:42] they're usually separated from the
[49:44] religious order of the day but they're
[49:46] raised up to represent God and the
[49:49] Supernatural is always with that Prophet
[49:53] to vindicate can you say Amen look look
[49:56] at Noah Noah was a an end time Prophet
[50:01] Noah was raised up because there was a
[50:05] junction of time judgment was fixing to
[50:08] strike and God wanted to bring Mercy to
[50:12] his people
[50:14] now God could have just changed all of
[50:16] their hearts and God could have amen
[50:18] done something different but he raised
[50:20] up a prophet he raised up one man to
[50:24] declare his word and his and his and
[50:26] there was two there was two reasons to
[50:28] to pronounce judgment and also a man to
[50:33] provide a way of Escape so when Noah was
[50:36] out there saying God is fixing to judge
[50:41] this Earth
[50:43] amen now if you read all of the all of
[50:45] the stuff the scripture says that amen
[50:48] the last days would be just as it was in
[50:50] the days of Noah amen as it was in the
[50:53] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[50:56] coming of the son of man it's going to
[50:57] be the same way amen so you go back
[50:59] there and you look and you see all of
[51:01] the perversions when it said God
[51:03] repented that he even made man but yet
[51:07] he had an elect there on the earth and
[51:10] he says I am going to provide a a way of
[51:15] Escape
[51:16] well praise the Lord amen go back and
[51:19] read it the scripture says this day
[51:22] would be the same as that day amen it
[51:26] would be the same but you see God was
[51:28] coming to pronounce judgment God was
[51:31] going to bring judgment and I just want
[51:34] to tell you amen it was 120 years before
[51:37] the Judgment came
[51:39] 100 somebody say 120 years
[51:43] they had to wait 100 oh isn't that
[51:47] something well if that was of God it
[51:48] would have happened 20 years ago oh if
[51:50] that was of God that would have happened
[51:52] 50 years that would have happened
[51:54] [Music]
[51:55] 120 years
[51:58] of waiting before the rains a hit but
[52:03] you know what amount the elect of God
[52:06] was waiting on the inside of that Ark
[52:09] Waiting for God to fulfill his word and
[52:12] I want to say today there is something
[52:15] today there has been a message that has
[52:18] come in our day saying it's fixing to
[52:21] rain brother it's not going to rain rain
[52:23] it's going to rain hell fire and
[52:25] brimstone this Earth is fixing to burn
[52:28] up you need to come into Christ the word
[52:34] can you say amen amen Moses was an
[52:38] end-time messenger he was sent to
[52:41] deliver Israel from the 400 years of
[52:45] Oppression of slavery and God appeared
[52:48] amen and he told Moses I have called you
[52:53] to go down and represent me to the
[52:57] children of Israel
[52:59] now Moses just was saying now I I need
[53:02] to have some kind of a I I I I want to
[53:05] know I need to know for myself that it's
[53:07] you I see you in the burning bush amen
[53:10] but I need some evidence myself and the
[53:13] children of Israel are going to need
[53:16] some evidence amen I just can't go down
[53:19] there and say that I'm a deliverer that
[53:21] I'm a prophet or that amen but I need
[53:24] something to know that you are with me
[53:28] and I tell you what it's God's desire
[53:30] God's Supernatural and God will always
[53:34] make sure that he vindicates his man
[53:39] that he is in
[53:41] amen he'll do it and you you can rise up
[53:44] and say anything you want to but until
[53:46] God Vindicated himself
[53:50] can you say Amen
[53:52] so when he would go out there and Moses
[53:55] would give his prophecies and it would
[53:58] come to pass the children of Israel were
[54:02] gaining strength and courage when the
[54:05] every time that that prophecy would come
[54:07] to pass when he would stand up and say
[54:09] Amen a pharaoh I'm going to speak flies
[54:13] into existence amen the children of
[54:16] Israel were hearing that too and and he
[54:18] would tell them Amen Let My People Go
[54:20] and and the Lord would Harden his heart
[54:23] and then amen so here there we go at
[54:26] every time the prophecy come to pass it
[54:31] was it was it was a checking of the
[54:35] heart of the people it was bringing a a
[54:38] a a a a a a a confidence to the heart of
[54:42] the people that God was speaking through
[54:46] that prophet
[54:47] why
[54:49] because it was going to require mortal
[54:51] men
[54:54] to listen to a mortal man
[54:58] it was going to require human beings to
[55:02] listen to another human being therefore
[55:07] God was going to show be on the shadow
[55:11] of a doubt that he was with Moses
[55:18] how did Brother John have you ever
[55:20] thought about it what cost two and a
[55:23] half million people
[55:25] to believe that one man
[55:28] on that to Exodus time
[55:31] it was God vindicating over and over and
[55:36] over and over that God was with him why
[55:41] was God doing this over and over because
[55:44] it was going to require the elect of God
[55:48] to know that the supernatural God was
[55:51] there vindicating his work you see the
[55:55] prophet was a word prophet he didn't
[55:58] just come in and say but you see he went
[56:00] back to what God had already told
[56:03] Abraham at the end of 400 years I will
[56:08] deliver with a strong and mighty hand
[56:11] and now here he is now anybody could
[56:14] stand up and say amen I I I'm the
[56:17] deliverer amen I'm the prophet I'm the
[56:20] one that's come you seek anyone could
[56:23] say it but you see there was one man
[56:26] that God had Anointed with his holy
[56:30] spirit to bring them out and into
[56:36] Hallelujah any preacher can get up there
[56:39] with a gift and sing and and and preach
[56:42] and any any preacher can say whatever
[56:44] they want to say but when When God says
[56:47] it then you know that it's him
[56:51] well praise the Lord
[56:53] now
[56:54] the Bible says that when
[56:57] when God Appears to Israel in Horeb he
[56:59] brings them out and now God's wanting to
[57:02] show himself who he is
[57:04] so God is going to God's going to show
[57:07] what really took place
[57:10] amen and and the Bible says they're in
[57:13] Exodus 19 and 16 and it came to pass on
[57:17] the third day in the morning that there
[57:19] were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick
[57:22] Cloud upon the mountain and the voice of
[57:24] the trumpet exceeding loud
[57:25] so that all the people that was in the
[57:27] camp trembled and Moses brought forth
[57:30] the people out of the camp to meet God
[57:33] and they stood at the
[57:35] neither part of the mountain and mount
[57:38] and Mount Sinai was all together on
[57:40] spoke because the Lord descended upon it
[57:42] in a fire
[57:43] and the smoke thereof ascended as the
[57:46] smoke of a furnace and the whole
[57:48] Mountain shook quite greatly and when
[57:51] the voice of the trumpet sounded long
[57:54] and waxed louder and louder Moses Pake
[57:57] and God answered him by a voice
[57:59] and the Lord came down
[58:01] upon Mount Sinai on top of the mountain
[58:04] and the Lord called Moses up to the top
[58:08] of the mountain and Moses went up can
[58:12] you say Amen now now I want you to catch
[58:15] the picture God is revealing himself
[58:19] in a real in a supernatural way to let
[58:22] the people know listen
[58:24] I am with everything that Moses told you
[58:28] about at the beginning amen I'm here to
[58:30] vindicate it
[58:32] I am the god of all gods can you say
[58:35] Amen now now if you were to go on down
[58:37] to the let's just see their reaction
[58:39] let's look here at Exodus 20 and 18. and
[58:42] all the people uh saw the thunderings
[58:45] and the Lightnings and the noise of the
[58:47] trumpet and the mountain smoking and
[58:49] when the people saw it they removed and
[58:51] stood afar off and they said unto Moses
[58:55] speak thou with us and we will hear but
[58:58] let not God speak with us lest we die
[59:04] well praise the Lord
[59:07] amen so now they're saying hey whoa whoa
[59:10] whoa we're Mortals
[59:13] we're in this we're in this defiled
[59:15] flesh we we come from from a sexual
[59:19] birth
[59:20] there is no way that we can come into
[59:22] the presence of God but praise the Lord
[59:25] amen you look there in Exodus 8 or
[59:28] Deuteronomy 18 and 15. amen you and then
[59:31] of course if you read all of all of
[59:33] those scriptures you will see amen but
[59:36] here's where God makes the Declaration
[59:37] they're in 18 uh Deuteronomy 18 and 15
[59:41] the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee
[59:45] a prophet from the midst of thee and of
[59:47] thy Brethren like unto me and unto him
[59:49] you shall hearken according to all that
[59:52] thou desirest of the Lord thy God and
[59:54] in the day of the assembly saying
[59:56] let us let me not hear uh again the
[59:59] voice of the Lord my God neither let me
[1:00:01] see the great fire anymore that I die
[1:00:03] not the Lord said unto me they have well
[1:00:07] spoken that which they have spoken I
[1:00:11] will raise them up a prophet from a
[1:00:16] Hmong their brethren
[1:00:20] Hallelujah so now God is now going to
[1:00:23] show what he's going to do when God
[1:00:26] wants to speak
[1:00:29] he's going to bring up a prophet from
[1:00:33] among mortal beings
[1:00:36] well praise the Lord
[1:00:38] are you understanding you see now God
[1:00:41] the unchanging God what's he ever sets
[1:00:45] it into motion it will forever be in
[1:00:48] motion
[1:00:50] while in this while in this in this
[1:00:53] lifespan can you say Amen so mortal
[1:00:56] beings God will raise up
[1:01:00] praise the Lord did you notice that it's
[1:01:02] hard
[1:01:03] you know who's the hardest one to listen
[1:01:05] to in your family
[1:01:07] his dad
[1:01:10] you know why
[1:01:11] because Dad wants to lead and the family
[1:01:15] knows all of his failures
[1:01:19] well praise the Lord you know you know
[1:01:22] you know because Dad sometimes have to
[1:01:24] say Hey guys you're wrong and then you
[1:01:27] look back and say
[1:01:28] who are you
[1:01:30] who are you to say we're wrong Mr
[1:01:35] Perfect
[1:01:36] right
[1:01:38] and it's hard Hallelujah who who who
[1:01:41] finds it hard sometimes to follow the
[1:01:44] pastor
[1:01:46] why because sometimes he has to stand up
[1:01:50] and say you're wrong and what you want
[1:01:52] to ah yeah oh yeah let me see how you've
[1:01:57] handled your family
[1:01:58] yeah how did you have can you say Amen
[1:02:02] but you see it's yeah and sometimes
[1:02:04] we're looking at the man and we are
[1:02:07] failing to see the office
[1:02:13] Hallelujah
[1:02:15] you are failing to see yes God
[1:02:19] ordained a mortal Fallen human being by
[1:02:25] the name of Wendell Martin
[1:02:26] to be pastor
[1:02:29] amen and it's because of that there has
[1:02:32] been many that have just walked away and
[1:02:34] said I can't follow that Fallen flawed
[1:02:37] mortal being
[1:02:39] right
[1:02:42] huh
[1:02:44] but you see if we can see Hallelujah now
[1:02:48] I'm just using this in the natural
[1:02:49] because we all God has ordained Fallen
[1:02:54] mortal human beings to lead his church
[1:02:59] the fivefold ministry the pastor uh the
[1:03:03] Evangelist Apostle Prophet teacher the
[1:03:07] uh all of these men are raised up out of
[1:03:13] mortal beings
[1:03:20] now this is in a in a small category
[1:03:25] the husband the father is the head of
[1:03:29] the home
[1:03:30] the pastor is The Shepherd of the flock
[1:03:34] but the prophet
[1:03:37] Hallelujah
[1:03:39] are y'all still with me
[1:03:41] I can teach false Doctrine
[1:03:48] I can get off
[1:03:50] I I have a tendency how many has ever
[1:03:52] heard me have come up and apologize
[1:03:56] there's things to taught you
[1:03:59] know that I've had to come back and say
[1:04:01] hey guys I was wrong
[1:04:05] and you've got to look at me with Grace
[1:04:07] and say well
[1:04:08] amen show us in the scripture and where
[1:04:11] there's been some that's even I've I've
[1:04:12] even I've something that I've preached
[1:04:14] and you say brother well that's not
[1:04:16] exactly correct and and you show it to
[1:04:18] me and I look at it and I say well dog
[1:04:20] gone I missed that one and I have to get
[1:04:23] up and say hey guys I I didn't read the
[1:04:26] other verse all right amen because I am
[1:04:28] a mortal it's not that I want to be
[1:04:31] wrong
[1:04:33] it's just that I'm a mortal being and
[1:04:36] I'm capable of that
[1:04:37] but a word prophet
[1:04:41] is one that God
[1:04:44] takes from the from his birth
[1:04:47] and keeps him because he is a man that
[1:04:52] the people are going to have to look to
[1:04:55] now are there times amen are there are
[1:05:00] there times where where I mean are we
[1:05:03] are we dealing with Mortal men when
[1:05:04] we're dealing with prophets yes yes yes
[1:05:10] and there were plenty of times where
[1:05:11] brother Brandon would take on the on the
[1:05:12] seals or on the on the seals he says I
[1:05:15] went through the seals Hall at one time
[1:05:16] amen back in there in the early days
[1:05:18] amen and he was telling us as he was as
[1:05:21] the angel the Lord was standing there
[1:05:23] revealing the seals he says guys
[1:05:25] I brought this all he says I took that
[1:05:28] first horse rider and and made him the
[1:05:31] Holy Spirit
[1:05:32] he said that's all I knew
[1:05:34] and he said all today I would have made
[1:05:37] an awful mistake
[1:05:39] I would have made an awful mistake if
[1:05:42] the angel of the Lord hadn't came in the
[1:05:43] room and said no that's not the holy
[1:05:46] spirit that is the Antichrist
[1:05:49] in deception
[1:05:52] now the prophet had to come back and say
[1:05:55] now listen but what was God doing God
[1:05:58] was God already told us that he was
[1:06:01] going to come in three stages of his
[1:06:03] ministry and in that third stage is
[1:06:06] where is where God but he was getting
[1:06:08] the people's attention
[1:06:11] so that he could accept we would accept
[1:06:13] the word when it came
[1:06:16] what praise the Lord
[1:06:18] now
[1:06:19] I hope I hope I'm I'm doing or not not
[1:06:21] too scattered here but now I will raise
[1:06:26] there there go back uh sister keys are
[1:06:28] Deuteronomy 18 and 15. I will or 18.
[1:06:33] Hallelujah 18 and 18. I will raise them
[1:06:36] up a prophet from among their Brethren
[1:06:38] like unity and we'll put my words in his
[1:06:40] mouth and he will speak unto them all
[1:06:43] that I shall command him and it shall
[1:06:45] come to pass that whatsoever whosoever
[1:06:48] will not hearken unto my words which he
[1:06:51] shall speak in my name I will require it
[1:06:54] of him can you say Amen so now God is
[1:06:58] telling them okay I'm going to hear you
[1:06:59] I got you
[1:07:03] I'll raise up a prophet
[1:07:05] it would have been a lot easier for you
[1:07:06] to just sit there and listen to me
[1:07:09] but now I'm going to raise up a man
[1:07:13] and I will vindicate that man and you
[1:07:17] would better heed to what that man is
[1:07:20] saying
[1:07:24] Hallelujah
[1:07:25] it would have been easier just to
[1:07:27] surrender yourselves to the but we're
[1:07:29] mortal sinful listen
[1:07:32] it takes a special being a man to come
[1:07:36] it's going to take a special body to
[1:07:39] come and bask in his presence how many
[1:07:41] ever comes into his presence when you
[1:07:43] feel his presence and it just sometimes
[1:07:45] you're numb sometimes I get into the
[1:07:48] spirit of the Lord while I'm preaching
[1:07:49] and I've gotten so deep into that other
[1:07:52] realm now imagine that you can sort of
[1:07:55] see the glass the eyes glass gloss over
[1:07:57] a little bit amen but when a man comes
[1:07:59] out of that he is so he is so uh
[1:08:03] he's wore her out this body he cannot
[1:08:07] handle it
[1:08:09] therefore God sends prophets to do that
[1:08:12] well can you say Amen
[1:08:14] now when God sends a prophet that man
[1:08:17] those men are bold they're Fearless
[1:08:20] they'll stand against all the odds
[1:08:23] amen why they're separated from birth to
[1:08:26] be a prophet
[1:08:28] I want us to look just real quickly to
[1:08:30] Jeremiah
[1:08:31] look at the Prophet Jeremiah who stood
[1:08:34] at the most at a most crucial Junction
[1:08:37] of time for Israel and and there he was
[1:08:42] bold with his message pronouncing
[1:08:44] judgment upon the nation and the
[1:08:46] scripture says the king the princes the
[1:08:50] entire nation hated Jeremiah
[1:08:54] and he and is because he wasn't for the
[1:08:56] good of the people let's just look here
[1:08:58] real quickly Jeremiah 38 and 4. it says
[1:09:01] therefore the princess said unto the
[1:09:03] king we beseech you seeks thee let this
[1:09:07] man be put to death
[1:09:09] for thus he weakeneth the hands of the
[1:09:12] men of War
[1:09:13] that remaineth in this city now if you
[1:09:15] and again if you go back there and look
[1:09:16] at the prophecies Jeremiah is standing
[1:09:18] up
[1:09:19] he is saying because you have rejected
[1:09:22] God because you have refused to turn
[1:09:24] away from turn back to God he says I'm
[1:09:28] going to uh he says you're going into
[1:09:30] judgment you're going to be going into
[1:09:32] Exile and it begins to uh predict what
[1:09:36] is fixing to take place and that they're
[1:09:38] going to be there for 70 years and so uh
[1:09:43] and and so here he says he weakeneth the
[1:09:46] hands of the men of war that remain in
[1:09:48] this city in the hands of all the people
[1:09:49] in speaking such words and to them for
[1:09:52] this man seeketh not the welfare of this
[1:09:55] people but hurt then zedekiah the king
[1:09:58] said behold he is in your hand for the
[1:10:00] king it is not he that do anything
[1:10:03] against you and then they took Jeremiah
[1:10:06] and cast him into the dungeon with with
[1:10:09] uh with malca the son of Hamlet
[1:10:13] that was in the court of the prison and
[1:10:16] and they let down Jeremiah with cords in
[1:10:19] the in the dungeon with no water uh but
[1:10:23] mire so Jeremiah sunk in the mire amen
[1:10:27] now now now I want you to catch this now
[1:10:29] Josephus says that he sunk into this
[1:10:33] amen it was it was like a lagoon and he
[1:10:36] had sunk
[1:10:37] all the way up until he couldn't sit
[1:10:39] down he couldn't do anything he was in
[1:10:42] manure
[1:10:43] now this was what the the the society
[1:10:48] had done to that problem could you
[1:10:51] imagine if they would have had internet
[1:10:52] on that day
[1:10:55] could you imagine Hallelujah
[1:10:58] if they would have had internet and what
[1:11:00] was been circulating and that'll that
[1:11:02] old Prophet
[1:11:04] amen if he was God's Prophet you know
[1:11:07] he'd be trying to to help us to defy our
[1:11:09] enemies he'd be trying to to Rally us
[1:11:12] all together you know as a church now
[1:11:15] here we are amen you see he he if we
[1:11:18] need an encourager not a condemner
[1:11:21] who needs Jeremiah he's condemning we
[1:11:23] need someone to encourage us
[1:11:26] well praise the Lord
[1:11:28] but you see Jeremiah was God's selected
[1:11:31] man if you look there and Jeremiah 1 and
[1:11:33] 4 it says and the word of the Lord came
[1:11:36] unto me saying before I formed thee in
[1:11:39] the belly I knew thee before thou
[1:11:41] cameest out of the womb I Sanctified
[1:11:44] thee and ordained thee a prophet unto
[1:11:47] the Nations then said I ah Lord God
[1:11:50] behold I cannot speak for I am a child
[1:11:53] and the Lord said unto me say not I'm a
[1:11:56] child for Thou shalt go to all that I
[1:11:59] shall send thee and whatsoever I command
[1:12:03] thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of
[1:12:06] their faces for I am with thee to
[1:12:08] deliver thee saith the Lord then the
[1:12:10] Lord put forth his hand and touched my
[1:12:12] mouth and said unto me behold I have put
[1:12:15] my words in thy mouth I have this day
[1:12:18] set thee over the Nations and over the
[1:12:20] kingdoms to root out to pull down to
[1:12:23] destroy to throw down to build and to
[1:12:27] plant you see God called that man
[1:12:32] now the people didn't believe it
[1:12:34] they didn't believe that the angel of
[1:12:36] the Lord appeared unto Jeremiah as a
[1:12:39] child they didn't believe it
[1:12:41] well praise the Lord
[1:12:43] but I want to tell you it come to pass
[1:12:47] exactly well
[1:12:50] it come to pass exactly like God said it
[1:12:53] would amen well glory to God I tell you
[1:12:57] amen you know you look you your prophets
[1:12:59] have always had to Stand Alone look at
[1:13:00] their and first Samuel 3 and 18. and and
[1:13:04] Samuel told him every wit and hid
[1:13:05] nothing from him and he said it is the
[1:13:07] Lord let him do what seemeth him good
[1:13:09] and Samuel grew and the Lord was with
[1:13:12] him and did let none of his words fall
[1:13:16] to the ground
[1:13:19] well praise the Lord
[1:13:26] so what do you
[1:13:27] anyone we
[1:13:29] we God
[1:13:31] oh a prophet at the junction of time
[1:13:35] amen what about Micaiah am I going too
[1:13:38] slow here this morning
[1:13:40] Michaela was standing the 400 Hebrew
[1:13:42] prophets amen you remember that there
[1:13:45] were the two kings matter of fact if you
[1:13:46] want to turn there in in First Kings 22
[1:13:49] and 1 and we're going to read a lot of
[1:13:52] this chapter here amen and and I I think
[1:13:56] it's good for you young people or for
[1:13:57] all of us y'all we we
[1:13:59] these scriptures we should uh
[1:14:04] we should know them and and know where
[1:14:07] they are and and and and read them for
[1:14:10] ourselves I the the board is wonderful
[1:14:12] and and and it does make things it helps
[1:14:15] us to put a lot of material in in one
[1:14:17] service but but uh uh make sure you go
[1:14:21] back and look at these things here
[1:14:22] because the scripture is plumful we are
[1:14:26] built upon the foundation of mortal men
[1:14:32] mortal man that were ordained of God
[1:14:36] with his word
[1:14:38] can you say Amen now watch amen now
[1:14:42] we've got the two kings I'll set the
[1:14:44] stage we got the two kings we've got
[1:14:46] Wicked Ahab who was living under a curse
[1:14:48] because the Prophet Elijah had already
[1:14:51] said because of your sin you're going to
[1:14:54] die
[1:14:56] and and and and and and and and that uh
[1:14:59] uh Wicked Jezebel is going to be eaten
[1:15:02] by the dogs
[1:15:03] amen now the lukewarm compromiser the
[1:15:07] lukewarm church member is Jehoshaphat he
[1:15:10] knew that that that that Ahab was cursed
[1:15:13] but he wanted to get along so here we
[1:15:16] have we have the cursed Wicked Man and
[1:15:20] then we've got uh Jehoshaphat a lukewarm
[1:15:23] King it says and they uh they're in uh
[1:15:26] First Kings 22 and 1 and they continued
[1:15:29] three years without war between Syria
[1:15:32] and Israel and it came to pass in the
[1:15:33] third year that Jehoshaphat the king of
[1:15:35] Judah come down to the king of Israel
[1:15:37] and the king of Israel said unto his
[1:15:39] servants know ye that remeth of Gilead
[1:15:41] is ours and we be still and take it not
[1:15:44] out of the hand of the king of Syria and
[1:15:46] he said unto Jehoshaphat well thou go
[1:15:49] with me to battle in raymeth Gilead and
[1:15:51] Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel
[1:15:53] I'm as Thou Art my people is thy people
[1:15:56] my horses is thy horses now I want you
[1:15:59] to look here they were all Israelites
[1:16:01] but one was a separate to Judah unto God
[1:16:06] Israel had had already backslid
[1:16:09] amen but God was now dealing with Judah
[1:16:12] now watch now here's Jehoshaphat saying
[1:16:15] my people are thine my horses are thine
[1:16:18] and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of
[1:16:19] Israel inquire I pray thee at the word
[1:16:22] of the Lord today
[1:16:25] then the king of Israel gathered the
[1:16:27] prophets together somebody say Prophets
[1:16:30] about 400 men and said unto them shall I
[1:16:34] go against rameth Gilead
[1:16:36] to battle or shall I forbear and they
[1:16:39] said go up for the Lord shall deliver it
[1:16:42] into the hand of the king
[1:16:44] and Jehoshaphat said is there not here a
[1:16:47] prophet of the Lord besides that we
[1:16:49] might inquire of him and the king of
[1:16:51] Israel said unto Jehoshaphat there is
[1:16:54] yet one man Michaela the son of imlah by
[1:16:58] whom we may inquire of the Lord but I
[1:17:00] hate him for he doth not prophesy good
[1:17:03] concerning me but evil and Joseph had
[1:17:06] said let not the king say so then the
[1:17:09] king of Israel called an officer and
[1:17:11] said hey sin dither Micaiah the son of
[1:17:13] emblem now the McKay is already in
[1:17:16] prison and the king of Israel and
[1:17:18] Jehoshaphat the king of Judah said each
[1:17:20] on his throne having put on their robes
[1:17:22] and avoid place in the entrance of the
[1:17:23] Gate of Samaria and all the prophets
[1:17:25] prophesied before them and zedekiah the
[1:17:29] son of kanina made him horns of iron and
[1:17:32] he said thus saith the Lord with these
[1:17:36] shalt thou push the syrians until thou
[1:17:39] have consumed them and all the prophets
[1:17:41] prophesied so saying go up to raymuth
[1:17:44] Gilead and prosper for the Lord shall
[1:17:46] deliver it in the king's hand and the
[1:17:48] messenger that was going to call
[1:17:49] Michaela speaking to him saying behold
[1:17:52] now the words of the prophets declare
[1:17:55] good unto the king with one mouth let
[1:17:57] Thy word I pray thee be like the word of
[1:18:00] one of them speak that which is good and
[1:18:03] Makaya said as the Lord liveth what the
[1:18:06] Lord saith unto me that will I speak oh
[1:18:09] man and so he came to the king
[1:18:12] and the King said unto him Ikea shall we
[1:18:14] go up to Raymond Gillian or shall we for
[1:18:16] bear and he answered go and prosper for
[1:18:19] the Lord shall deliver it in the king
[1:18:21] the hand of the king
[1:18:22] and the King said unto him how many
[1:18:25] times shall I adjour Thee that thou tell
[1:18:28] me nothing but that which is true in the
[1:18:30] name of the Lord
[1:18:32] and he said I saw all Israel scattered
[1:18:35] upon the heels I'll ask sheep that have
[1:18:37] not a shepherd and the Lord said these
[1:18:41] have no master let them return every man
[1:18:44] to his house in peace and the king of
[1:18:46] Israel said unto Jehoshaphat did not I
[1:18:50] tell you that he would prophesy no good
[1:18:52] concerning me but evil
[1:18:56] we've got we've got four
[1:19:01] now we don't have 400 in here and we
[1:19:03] have what do we have amen 45 50 people
[1:19:05] here this morning
[1:19:06] amen okay
[1:19:09] could you imagine
[1:19:10] you against
[1:19:12] one man you against God's prophet
[1:19:17] why don't you try 400.
[1:19:21] amen so we had we had 400 at our youth
[1:19:23] camp a little over 400 there so take all
[1:19:27] all of those people and make them all
[1:19:29] spiritual men make them all Prophets
[1:19:33] and they're all saying thus saith the

[1:20:13] Hall we're live God is sending Revival
[1:20:16] you've not seen a Revival yet oh the
[1:20:18] Revival's coming no no no no
[1:20:21] Micah's Vision lined up with scripture
[1:20:24] Micah was simply saying what Elijah had
[1:20:29] already said
[1:20:32] Ahab was living under a curse
[1:20:37] and my chaos Vision he lined it up with
[1:20:42] scripture
[1:20:45] these men were not lining their
[1:20:48] prophecies up with scripture
[1:20:52] for the prophet had already sat Elijah
[1:20:55] is cursed
[1:20:57] now here comes Micah against the 400 he
[1:21:01] had heard from God but any true Prophet
[1:21:03] will always go back to scripture any
[1:21:06] word prophet
[1:21:08] and he comes out now with all the
[1:21:10] confidence and boldness I love a word
[1:21:12] Prophet he's pretty confident
[1:21:16] and he says Imam and he and he tells
[1:21:19] them and he tells him
[1:21:21] you're going to die Israel is going to
[1:21:23] be without a Shepherd let's go on down
[1:21:25] to the 19th verse it's uh you know we
[1:21:28] just read the 18th verse he said there's
[1:21:30] you know the king of Israel 18 said unto
[1:21:33] Jehoshaphat did not I tell thee that he
[1:21:36] would prophesy no good concerning me but
[1:21:38] evil and he said here thou therefore the
[1:21:40] word of the Lord this is the prophet I
[1:21:43] saw the Lord sitting on his throne and
[1:21:45] all the hosts of Heaven sitting by him
[1:21:47] in his hand
[1:21:49] on his right hand and on his left
[1:21:53] and the Lord said who shall persuade
[1:21:55] Ahab that he shall go and fall in rameth
[1:21:58] Gilead and one said on this manner and
[1:22:01] another set on that manner
[1:22:03] and there come forth the spirit and
[1:22:04] stood before the Lord and said I will
[1:22:06] persuade him and the Lord said unto him
[1:22:08] wherewith and he said I will go forth
[1:22:12] and I will be a lying spirit in the
[1:22:16] mouth of all of his Prophets
[1:22:18] and he said Thou shalt persuade him and
[1:22:23] Prevail also go forth and do so oh God
[1:22:27] Almighty When God says what about the
[1:22:30] scripture in this last day that says
[1:22:32] he'll turn them over to a reprobate mind
[1:22:36] because they've loved not the truth
[1:22:41] God will send a lying Spirit upon you
[1:22:45] and make you feel like you are right
[1:22:50] and you will be damned because you have
[1:22:55] refused the counsel of the Lord
[1:23:00] laodicea
[1:23:04] laodicea hear the words of the Lord
[1:23:08] there was a prophet that Rose in this
[1:23:11] day saying come back to the Bible
[1:23:19] but now they don't want it because
[1:23:20] they've got anointed men out there
[1:23:22] preaching and suiting their fancy and
[1:23:26] making them feel they're all right
[1:23:32] sorry
[1:23:35] the Lord has put
[1:23:37] a lying spirit
[1:23:40] 23rd verse
[1:23:42] the mouth of these prophets and the Lord
[1:23:45] has spoken evil concerning thee but
[1:23:48] zedekiah the son of Chana
[1:23:51] went near and smote Micah on the cheek
[1:23:55] and said which way went the spirit of
[1:23:57] the Lord for me to speak unto thee
[1:24:01] and Micah said behold Thou shalt see it
[1:24:04] in that day when thou shall go into the
[1:24:07] inner chamber to hide thyself
[1:24:09] and the king of Israel said take Micah
[1:24:11] carry him back unto amen the governor of
[1:24:15] the city and to joash the King's son and
[1:24:18] say thus saith the king put this fellow
[1:24:21] in prison and feed him the bread of
[1:24:23] affliction
[1:24:24] and with water of Affliction until I
[1:24:27] come in peace and Micah said if thou
[1:24:31] return at all in peace the Lord has not
[1:24:34] spoken by me he said hearken all people
[1:24:39] every one of you
[1:24:47] now here
[1:24:48] is the spirit of deception
[1:24:53] here are men claiming they have
[1:24:57] scripture when the scripture has already
[1:25:01] told them
[1:25:03] Ahab is cursed
[1:25:06] sons of God don't you believe that
[1:25:09] nonsense
[1:25:10] amen this read you read you read in our
[1:25:14] church age this lukewarm Church age it
[1:25:17] is a church age that is under the curse
[1:25:21] of God
[1:25:24] can you say Amen
[1:25:26] Junctions of time
[1:25:28] now we understand
[1:25:30] and I'll tell you how dumb I'll tell you
[1:25:32] how how how dumb Jehoshaphat was amen
[1:25:37] Ahab convinced Joseph hat to change
[1:25:41] clothes with him
[1:25:42] amen he said you put your when you put
[1:25:45] your garment on and I'll put my and I'll
[1:25:46] put your guy and and should they change
[1:25:49] clothes
[1:25:50] Lily and I'm thinking what a friend what
[1:25:52] a friend amen so eat so Jehoshaphat if
[1:25:57] you read on the scripture Jehoshaphat is
[1:25:59] wearing ahab's garments
[1:26:04] are you hearing me jehoshaphat's wearing
[1:26:07] ahabs and AFS wearing jehosh vets
[1:26:09] and the Bible says when they were in
[1:26:11] battle
[1:26:12] and and and and Ahab took off or they
[1:26:15] took off running and amen
[1:26:19] and the one guy just takes it
[1:26:23] takes it up in the air just but yes the
[1:26:25] Bible says
[1:26:27] and that Arrow was anointed of the Lord
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:31] and it struck Ahab wearing jehoshaphat's
[1:26:35] clothes
[1:26:36] [Laughter]
[1:26:37] can you say that
[1:26:39] uh
[1:26:42] he was Vindicated by scripture
[1:26:46] and they wouldn't believe it
[1:26:49] well praise the Lord
[1:26:51] now I want to say the unchanging God has
[1:26:56] never changed his program God always
[1:26:58] somebody say always
[1:27:01] he will always send a prophet
[1:27:04] that's the way he does it Amos 3 and 7
[1:27:07] surely the Lord will do nothing
[1:27:11] but he revealeth the secret unto his
[1:27:13] servants
[1:27:14] the prophet
[1:27:16] even to this last Church even to this
[1:27:18] last Church age Amen in the days of the
[1:27:21] voice of that seventh messenger
[1:27:24] the the mystery of God will be complete
[1:27:28] can you say Amen now now now some now
[1:27:32] again some people say that those Prophet
[1:27:36] Messengers was only to the Old Testament
[1:27:38] Church no no no no no no
[1:27:40] we were founded
[1:27:43] this what you believe is founded upon
[1:27:46] the prophet Paul's teaching
[1:27:49] Hallelujah well praise the Lord
[1:27:52] amen they sure were Paul was the prophet
[1:27:57] to the New Testament Church he set the
[1:28:00] church in order he divided law From
[1:28:02] Grace
[1:28:03] amen even to the point that Peter in his
[1:28:06] in his epistle he says now there's many
[1:28:08] things that our brother Paul writes that
[1:28:11] that are that are hard to be understood
[1:28:14] and some wrestle to their own
[1:28:18] destruction
[1:28:22] some wrestle with this Mortal man
[1:28:27] who went about killing all of the Saints
[1:28:29] and they're wrestling with what he's
[1:28:31] trying to tell them
[1:28:33] and Peter says and they do so
[1:28:36] to their own destruction
[1:28:39] Hallelujah that's scripture
[1:28:41] amen
[1:28:42] the Paul was bold about it
[1:28:44] Paul was bold with his Revelation they
[1:28:46] were in First Corinthians 14 and 36 he
[1:28:49] says what came the word out from you
[1:28:52] or came it unto you only that's First
[1:28:56] Corinthians 14 and 36 now we're in 37.
[1:28:58] If any man think himself to be a prophet
[1:29:01] or spiritual
[1:29:02] let him acknowledge that the things I
[1:29:05] write unto you are the Commandments of
[1:29:07] the Lord
[1:29:09] but if any man be arrogant let him be
[1:29:11] arrogant Galatians 1 and 6. I Marvel
[1:29:13] that you are so soon removed from him
[1:29:16] that called you into the grace of Christ
[1:29:18] unto another gospel which there is
[1:29:21] another not another
[1:29:23] uh but but there will be some that
[1:29:25] trouble you and would pervert the gospel
[1:29:27] of Christ but though we or an angel from
[1:29:29] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:29:32] than that which we have preached unto
[1:29:34] you let him be accursed and if and we as
[1:29:37] we said before so say I now again if any
[1:29:41] man preach any other gospel unto you
[1:29:44] than you have received let him be
[1:29:46] accursed for do I now persuade men or
[1:29:49] God do I seek to please men for if I yet
[1:29:52] please men should I not be the servant
[1:29:54] of Christ I I certify you Brethren the
[1:29:57] gospel was preached of me is not after
[1:30:00] man
[1:30:01] for I neither received it of a man
[1:30:03] neither was I taught it but by the
[1:30:06] revelation of Jesus Christ now he goes
[1:30:09] on talking I remember for a Time sake
[1:30:11] was going down to the 15th verse but it
[1:30:13] pleased God who separated me from my
[1:30:16] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[1:30:20] to reveal his son in me that I may
[1:30:24] preach him among the Heathen immediately
[1:30:27] I conferred not with flesh and blood
[1:30:29] neither when I went up to Jerusalem to
[1:30:31] them which were Apostles before me but I
[1:30:33] went into Arabia and then returned to
[1:30:35] Damascus then after three years I went
[1:30:37] up to Jerusalem to see Peter and a boat
[1:30:39] with him for 15 days so he is saying
[1:30:41] this is not something my gospel that I'm
[1:30:44] preaching I didn't get it from the other
[1:30:46] 12. I didn't get it from this I didn't
[1:30:48] get a friend God has separated me
[1:30:51] himself
[1:30:56] as a light to the Gentiles
[1:31:00] can you say Amen now
[1:31:03] and the Apostle Paul even rebuked Peter
[1:31:05] because Peter was over there still
[1:31:07] trying amen trying to to bring
[1:31:10] dissension between the Jews and the
[1:31:11] Gentiles amen hear the Apostle Peter was
[1:31:14] used of the Lord to go and bring the
[1:31:16] gospel to then Gentiles but here he was
[1:31:18] trying to keep himself from you know
[1:31:21] from eating with the Gentiles and the
[1:31:23] apostles the Apostle Paul withstood him
[1:31:25] to his face
[1:31:26] the Apostle Paul says you're to blame
[1:31:29] the reason why we've got dissension
[1:31:31] between in the church here between the
[1:31:33] Jew and the Gentile is because you are
[1:31:36] acting the way you are
[1:31:40] that's in the book of Acts
[1:31:43] amen
[1:31:45] so
[1:31:46] so God did use has used always will use
[1:31:51] a prophet at Junctions of time
[1:31:56] you believe that
[1:31:57] now
[1:31:59] now each of the seven Junctions or
[1:32:02] period of this church history
[1:32:05] God used men to rise up
[1:32:10] now we're going to be getting into this
[1:32:11] in the weeks to come
[1:32:13] but look at Revelations two and one now
[1:32:16] these are the stars that are in the
[1:32:19] hands
[1:32:20] of of the Christ the one walking in the
[1:32:23] midst of the candlesticks now remember
[1:32:25] amen he had he seen the stars and then
[1:32:28] he seen the seven candlesticks Christ
[1:32:30] walking in among all the candlesticks
[1:32:33] and then he says now this The Mystery of
[1:32:36] the Seven Stars are the seven angels now
[1:32:40] those were those angels
[1:32:43] amen are messengers their Earthly
[1:32:46] Messengers
[1:32:48] and in this case here
[1:32:50] amen uh
[1:32:53] the in in the in the in the New
[1:32:55] Testament when you when you look there
[1:32:57] at this word Angel it'll actually in the
[1:33:01] Greek uh it'll actually say Earthly
[1:33:04] messenger or you that's that's the
[1:33:07] that's the definition so angels can be
[1:33:10] used for
[1:33:11] a for profit and it can also be used for
[1:33:14] an earth or an Heavenly Angel you just
[1:33:16] got to look at at the at they use the
[1:33:19] same word uh when when dealing with
[1:33:22] either or
[1:33:23] but this here you can clearly say you
[1:33:26] can clearly see that he's talking about
[1:33:28] the the Earthly messenger
[1:33:32] and most all uh Scholars agree to that
[1:33:36] now
[1:33:37] uh they're they're in Revelations two
[1:33:40] and one unto the angel of the Church of
[1:33:44] Ephesus right these things saith he that
[1:33:47] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[1:33:49] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[1:33:51] seven golden candlesticks let's go on
[1:33:54] down to the next Church age Revelations
[1:33:56] 2 and 8. unto the angel of the church in
[1:34:01] Smyrna these things saith the first and
[1:34:04] the last which was dead and is alive
[1:34:06] let's go down to Revelations 2 and 12.
[1:34:08] unto the angel in pergamus write these
[1:34:13] things saith he that hath the sharp
[1:34:15] sword with two edges two and eighteen
[1:34:17] and and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:34:20] thyatira write these things saith the
[1:34:23] Son of God which hath his eyes like a
[1:34:26] flame of fire and and his feet like
[1:34:29] brass Revelations 3 and 1 unto the angel
[1:34:32] of the church in Sardis right these
[1:34:36] things saith he that hath the seven
[1:34:37] spirits and the Seven Stars I Know Thy
[1:34:40] Works thou Hast a name that thou livest
[1:34:43] and are dead Revelations now and I want
[1:34:45] you to look I want you to look where are
[1:34:48] these Stars where are these Messengers
[1:34:51] they're in
[1:34:53] his right hand
[1:34:57] not his left hand his right hand his he
[1:35:00] there in his right hand
[1:35:06] praise the Lord
[1:35:08] now he's letting them know
[1:35:10] Hallelujah I've got I'm going to happen
[1:35:13] there's going to be seven distinct
[1:35:15] periods
[1:35:16] I will have a messenger to each one of
[1:35:20] those periods or Junctions
[1:35:24] amen there's going to be age period And
[1:35:27] there's Junctions at each time and I
[1:35:30] will always send a messenger in there
[1:35:36] at the end of those periods
[1:35:39] amen
[1:35:40] I will bring them in because they're
[1:35:43] going to take you into a into a
[1:35:45] different light now if you were to go to
[1:35:47] Revelations 3 and 7 under the angel of
[1:35:50] of the church in Philadelphia right
[1:35:52] these things saith he that is Holy he
[1:35:54] that is true he that hath the Key of
[1:35:56] David he that openeth and no man shuteth
[1:35:57] and shut it for no man open them until
[1:36:00] it comes on down to Revelations 3 and 14
[1:36:02] unto the angel of the Church of laodicea
[1:36:05] write these things saith thee amen the
[1:36:08] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:36:09] of the creation of God so so here we are
[1:36:13] now we're living all the way down in
[1:36:15] this seventh age
[1:36:16] amen there's already been The Messengers
[1:36:18] that have come
[1:36:20] throughout these last two thousand years
[1:36:22] they have come through those ages amen
[1:36:25] and they're dealing they're they're
[1:36:27] these are prophecies that are being
[1:36:30] dealt with the church didn't really know
[1:36:32] it until this last day when the when the
[1:36:36] veil is taken off the Plan of Redemption
[1:36:39] the people had to trust
[1:36:46] every one of those Messengers
[1:36:48] even even Saint Martin but wait wait
[1:36:50] back there in those Dark Ages when the
[1:36:52] Bible was was was was was was uh uh you
[1:36:56] know taken away from the church and even
[1:36:59] all of Columbus and Martin all every one
[1:37:01] of them spoke with tongues every one of
[1:37:03] them had signs and wonders every one of
[1:37:05] them seen Visions every one of them had
[1:37:08] the powers of God in their life there
[1:37:11] was a supernatural presence with those
[1:37:15] men
[1:37:18] what praise the Lord
[1:37:20] but now we're living
[1:37:22] at the end the end not the end of a
[1:37:26] dispensation not the end of the first
[1:37:28] age or the third age or the fifth age
[1:37:30] we're living at the end
[1:37:32] of the seventh
[1:37:35] and at the seventh messenger's voice the
[1:37:39] mystery of God should be complete
[1:37:47] isn't this beautiful
[1:37:49] now God has always done it he's always
[1:37:51] kept it now we're built upon the words
[1:37:54] of those Prophets
[1:37:57] now we understand that now down Through
[1:37:59] the Ages we can see we can see through
[1:38:02] Revelations 2 and 3 that we'll be
[1:38:05] getting into we'll see how that the word
[1:38:07] started out hot but even at the end of
[1:38:10] the Ephesian Church age the very first
[1:38:12] one he says I have somewhat against you
[1:38:16] you've lost your first love
[1:38:19] and then he's called them to repent and
[1:38:21] then we come into the second age and we
[1:38:23] find that that Spirit of deception that
[1:38:25] was trying to make its way through but
[1:38:27] could not make his way through the first
[1:38:29] church age was now coming in and it says
[1:38:32] hey you've got those ones that are that
[1:38:35] are the the that are uh uh uh you you've
[1:38:38] got the the you know nickelatins that
[1:38:40] are among you that are talking among you
[1:38:42] trying to conquer the laity by the time
[1:38:44] he gets into the third age he's he's
[1:38:46] standing there amen and he's and he's
[1:38:48] and he's giving him an open rebuke now
[1:38:50] you're letting Jazzy Bell to even teach
[1:38:53] you
[1:38:55] at Roman Church he's worming her way in
[1:38:58] warming her way in but in the midst of
[1:39:00] it all there was always a messenger
[1:39:03] standing up declaring those Messengers
[1:39:06] gave their lives for this they would
[1:39:09] stand up
[1:39:11] they said come back to
[1:39:13] back turd
[1:39:14] can you say man
[1:39:16] oh yes
[1:39:18] until it goes on down they man until the
[1:39:21] church goes to that very dark and the
[1:39:23] Bible says that amen when Luther Come
[1:39:25] Thou Hast just a little strength you
[1:39:28] don't have much strength and then here
[1:39:30] come Wesley the time of the of the uh of
[1:39:34] of of of of of of of the great the open
[1:39:36] door that's when the evangelism struck
[1:39:39] across the world
[1:39:41] Hallelujah but here we are we're in the
[1:39:44] in the very very last I want to tell you
[1:39:47] doesn't that give you confidence
[1:39:49] doesn't that give you confidence to know
[1:39:51] we we ain't got something way out in the
[1:39:53] future how is it Brother winner you can
[1:39:55] get up and preach that you believe the
[1:39:57] Rapture could come like any day right
[1:39:59] now is because the Bible has declared it
[1:40:02] the messenger has come to let us know
[1:40:09] amen now why is this Heaven messenger so
[1:40:12] important because it's the completion
[1:40:14] this is when look look look Daniel
[1:40:18] and John that what Daniel was to the Old
[1:40:21] Testament
[1:40:22] John was to the new they were and they
[1:40:25] both seen the same visions
[1:40:28] amen they were both told to seal up
[1:40:31] their books they were both told that it
[1:40:34] would be opened at the end
[1:40:35] let's look here at Daniel 12 and 8.
[1:40:39] and I heard but I understood not
[1:40:42] then said I oh Lord
[1:40:45] what shall the end of these what shall
[1:40:47] be the end of these things
[1:40:49] and he said go thy Way Daniel for the
[1:40:51] words are closed up and sealed till the
[1:40:56] time of the end
[1:40:58] many shall be purified made white and
[1:41:00] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[1:41:03] and none of the wicked shall understand
[1:41:04] but let's all say it together but the
[1:41:08] wise shall understand
[1:41:12] when the book is open
[1:41:15] the bride is going to understand
[1:41:19] what has been taken place
[1:41:25] let's look here let's let's go to
[1:41:27] Revelations five and two
[1:41:28] amen now remember all of those
[1:41:31] did you notice that in the Book of
[1:41:33] Revelations The Book of Revelations has
[1:41:35] the same symbols
[1:41:36] a whole bunch of the same symbols that
[1:41:39] that the Book of Daniel had
[1:41:41] the same symbols
[1:41:43] amen incredible isn't it but now now
[1:41:46] let's look here in Revelations five and
[1:41:47] two and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:41:50] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:41:54] the book and to loose the seals and
[1:41:56] remember it's sealed up it's closed up
[1:41:58] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth nor
[1:42:00] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:42:02] book neither to look upon I went much
[1:42:04] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:42:06] or to read the book neither to look
[1:42:09] there on is that right
[1:42:12] but what happened
[1:42:14] the lamb opens the book
[1:42:20] opens the book let's let's go now let's
[1:42:22] let's go on downstairs to Revelations 10
[1:42:24] and 1. amen
[1:42:27] and you you we've went through those on
[1:42:29] that fifth chapter lots of times amen so
[1:42:32] the lamb has opened the book now here
[1:42:35] comes the anointing of the mighty Angel
[1:42:36] the angel of the Covenant Christ the
[1:42:38] anointed one I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:42:40] come from Heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:42:43] rainbow was upon his head his face where
[1:42:46] is the sun his feet pillars of fire the
[1:42:48] same image that we saw there in in
[1:42:50] Revelations one and he had a in his hand
[1:42:53] a little book what
[1:42:56] a little book open and he set his right
[1:42:59] foot upon the sea his left foot upon the
[1:43:01] Earth and he cried with a loud voice
[1:43:04] as when a lion roared and when he when
[1:43:06] he cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:43:09] voices now let me just stop right here
[1:43:11] some people get get all they get tangled
[1:43:15] up on the on the one foot on land and
[1:43:18] one foot on sea okay show me one
[1:43:20] scripture
[1:43:22] where Christ will ever put his foot
[1:43:25] Jesus what physically put his foot upon
[1:43:29] upon uh upon the Earth
[1:43:32] until after
[1:43:34] uh uh uh until the millennial reign
[1:43:43] and the Seas will be done away with
[1:43:45] before the millennial reign
[1:43:49] so when Jesus puts his foot upon
[1:43:52] the Earth he's going to be in uh
[1:43:58] he's going he's going to come on Mount
[1:44:00] Olivet and when he reveals himself to
[1:44:02] the Jews is that right when he reveals
[1:44:04] now now watch where what are we talking
[1:44:07] about on land and sea let's let's look
[1:44:10] here real quickly to Revelations the
[1:44:12] 13th chapter
[1:44:15] amen
[1:44:17] and if I'm confusing you're welcome
[1:44:20] you're welcome to to speak up this
[1:44:22] morning
[1:44:25] okay so there in Revelations the 13th
[1:44:28] chapter the first verse and I stood upon
[1:44:29] the sand of the sea and a beast and I
[1:44:33] saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[1:44:35] having the seven heads ten horns and
[1:44:38] upon his horns uh ten crowns upon his
[1:44:40] crowns the name of blasphemy and the
[1:44:42] Beast I saw was like unto a leopard
[1:44:45] a feet of a bear in his mouth of a lion
[1:44:49] and the dragon and had power gave pan
[1:44:53] power and had great Authority now if you
[1:44:55] look at her at the three at these four
[1:44:57] deals that are that are there they are
[1:44:59] actually this is actually going back to
[1:45:01] Daniel what Daniel had referred to as
[1:45:04] well we know this all heads up in Rome I
[1:45:06] saw one of his heads as it were the
[1:45:08] wounded to death and the deadly womb was
[1:45:12] healed and all the world wandered after
[1:45:13] the Beast and they worshiped the dragon
[1:45:15] and gave power unto the Beast and they
[1:45:17] worshiped the Beast saying who was like
[1:45:19] unto the Beast and who was able to make
[1:45:21] war with him
[1:45:23] and so now now we understand that this
[1:45:26] this is Rome now let's go ahead let's go
[1:45:28] all the way on down to the 11th verse
[1:45:30] and I beheld another Beast coming up out
[1:45:33] of the earth so now we've got one Beast
[1:45:37] coming up out of the sea we've got one
[1:45:40] coming up out of the Earth
[1:45:42] when the anointing comes in this last
[1:45:45] day it is a spiritual coming it is God
[1:45:49] coming to prepare his people before his
[1:45:53] physical come
[1:45:56] the second coming of Christ when he
[1:45:58] comes he's not coming he's not going to
[1:46:00] put his foot here on Earth we are going
[1:46:02] to catch up to meet him
[1:46:05] if you're waiting for Christ to show up
[1:46:07] on Earth
[1:46:09] you've you've missed the rapture
[1:46:12] we are going to catch be caught up to
[1:46:16] meet him but he sends his anointing and
[1:46:20] what is he doing he's put one foot upon
[1:46:23] that USA I just want to put it Hollywood
[1:46:27] and he put the other one on Rome
[1:46:30] and he said time shall be no more now
[1:46:32] watch watch what he starts to declaring
[1:46:34] here amen he's that's an anointing that
[1:46:37] says you can't have my bride you can't
[1:46:40] have my church the denomination can't
[1:46:43] have them
[1:46:44] a Rome can't have them the the the the
[1:46:47] the the daughters of of the of the great
[1:46:50] can't have them and neither can
[1:46:52] Hollywood
[1:46:55] transsexualism can't have them
[1:46:58] homosexualism can't have them
[1:47:01] nothing can have them I put my word I've
[1:47:06] put my anointing upon them and I am
[1:47:11] claiming them
[1:47:13] man now he so in the second verse he had
[1:47:17] a little book
[1:47:18] uh with his hand with his in his hand
[1:47:21] his right foot upon the sea his left
[1:47:24] foot on the earth and he cried with the
[1:47:26] loud voices when a Ryan roared and when
[1:47:29] he cried seven Thunders under their
[1:47:30] voices
[1:47:31] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[1:47:33] their voices I was about to write and I
[1:47:35] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[1:47:38] seal up those things which the seven
[1:47:40] Thunders uttered and write them not and
[1:47:43] the angel which I saw stand up on the
[1:47:45] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[1:47:47] hand to heaven
[1:47:49] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:47:51] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:47:52] that are therein are and the earth and
[1:47:54] the things therein are and the seeing
[1:47:56] the things there therein are that time
[1:47:58] shall be no more but in the days of the
[1:48:01] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:48:04] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:48:09] be finished as he has declared to his
[1:48:12] servants the prophets
[1:48:14] now if you were just going down in the
[1:48:16] voice which I heard from Heaven speak
[1:48:19] unto me again and said go take the
[1:48:22] little book which is open in the hand of
[1:48:25] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[1:48:27] and upon the Earth and I went unto the
[1:48:29] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:48:32] little book and he said unto me take it
[1:48:35] eat it up it shall be uh thy belly
[1:48:38] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:48:40] sweet as honey I took the little book
[1:48:43] out of the Angel's hand and ate it up
[1:48:45] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:48:47] and as soon as I'd eaten it my belly was
[1:48:50] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:48:53] prophesy again before many peoples
[1:48:55] Nations tongues and kings can you say
[1:48:59] Amen
[1:49:00] now
[1:49:02] all right so here we stand
[1:49:05] here today
[1:49:07] what at this evening time
[1:49:11] I've got a problem with anyone who would
[1:49:14] say

[1:49:46] and and brother brother random says no
[1:49:49] that's adding
[1:49:50] to the word you can't add

[1:54:21] Christianity
[1:54:24] they have seen it in the churches and
[1:54:26] the denominations they've seen it
[1:54:29] lukewarmed oh it's so lukewarm and it
[1:54:31] doesn't even portray Christ at all

[1:54:45] seals

[1:55:06] of my word from them every time you kill
[1:55:08] them they're going to come up on another
[1:55:09] age and they're going to keep coming up
[1:55:11] and they're going to come up and one of

[1:55:32] there are the other churches amen
[1:55:34] they're going that it's there's nothing
[1:55:36] but judgment left for them there's
[1:55:38] nothing but judgment left for the
[1:55:40] and Oliver highlights but the bride will
[1:55:43] set it aside aren't you glad that God
[1:55:47] sent a witness to show you who you are
[1:55:51] in this generation Nation
[1:55:55] oh yes
[1:55:57] amen
[1:55:59] have you ever stopped to think about it
[1:56:01] have you ever stopped to think about the
[1:56:03] Old Testament just as the Apostle Paul
[1:56:06] amen
[1:56:07] was able Apostle Paul wasn't adding
[1:56:10] anything brother Michael he did he
[1:56:12] wasn't adding anything to the Bible he
[1:56:14] was simply going back and taking what
[1:56:17] the lamb was and what it meant what the
[1:56:19] Tabernacle was and what it is he was
[1:56:23] that one that was separating and showing
[1:56:26] what was the type and now it's the
[1:56:28] Fulfillment now here we are seven
[1:56:30] Messengers later and he's taking it all
[1:56:33] he's saying now let's look back and see
[1:56:36] what this was what the dragon was let's
[1:56:39] look to see what the Beast was let's
[1:56:41] look to see oh yes let's go to
[1:56:43] Revelations 13. oh yes let's look over
[1:56:45] here let's look here and he's putting it
[1:56:47] all together so that you can see who you
[1:56:52] are
[1:56:56] well praise the Lord
[1:56:58] why has there been seven years of
[1:57:00] science
[1:57:01] of sight why would God seal
[1:57:03] why would there be why would God put
[1:57:06] seven candlesticks and Seven Stars and
[1:57:11] the Great Horror and the four
[1:57:12] horseriders and
[1:57:13] the dragon and the four creatures around
[1:57:16] the throne and why would he do this in
[1:57:18] simple form
[1:57:20] I've got two answers and I'm fixing to
[1:57:22] close
[1:57:25] number one
[1:57:28] he wasn't going to let the devil know
[1:57:31] the end of the product
[1:57:33] the devil truly thought
[1:57:36] that he had this thing beat
[1:57:40] that praise the Lord
[1:57:42] now now he don't know
[1:57:44] he don't know Satan does not know the
[1:57:48] Bible says the secret things they're
[1:57:50] they're in Deuteronomy 29 and 29 put put
[1:57:53] that up there six keys I think it's 29
[1:57:55] and 29.
[1:57:57] the secret things
[1:57:59] belong to the Lord our God
[1:58:04] secret thing devil don't know the devil
[1:58:06] don't know what's in the back of God's
[1:58:07] mind
[1:58:08] but those things which are revealed
[1:58:12] belong
[1:58:14] unto us
[1:58:16] it didn't belong to the first the second
[1:58:18] the third they weren't rapturing this is
[1:58:22] the rapturing age God has hid it under
[1:58:25] cover and taken off the cover now it's
[1:58:28] not just God knowing about it now it's
[1:58:31] you knowing about it and now that the
[1:58:33] devil knows about it he's doing
[1:58:34] everything he can to kill you
[1:58:39] well that just makes me want to shout
[1:58:42] can you say man
[1:58:44] now
[1:58:45] amen so he could do great damage the
[1:58:49] devil could do great damage if he knew
[1:58:52] the whole plan
[1:58:53] amen so there's not been any kind of
[1:58:55] activity going on number two the church
[1:58:58] if the church knew that there were 2 000
[1:59:01] years
[1:59:03] in this Redemption
[1:59:06] she would have gotten Lacks
[1:59:08] after the first age she's just sit next
[1:59:10] well we got another couple thousand
[1:59:12] years to go
[1:59:13] amen hallelujah what can you say man
[1:59:17] if he would have went back and and told
[1:59:20] him the church would say well you know I
[1:59:22] you know I we we might as well eat and
[1:59:25] drink and be married because it's going
[1:59:26] to be many generations Jesus ain't
[1:59:28] coming for another 2 000 years
[1:59:32] amen the church would have been loose
[1:59:33] there would have been no on the mark
[1:59:34] there have been no waiting there had
[1:59:36] been no anticipation but as it was every
[1:59:39] Church age that has went to the ground
[1:59:41] every generation of Believers has went
[1:59:43] down to the ground expecting it to come
[1:59:45] in their generation
[1:59:47] they have went down the bride has went
[1:59:50] down believing Grandma went down
[1:59:51] believing great grandma went down
[1:59:53] believing great great great grandma went
[1:59:55] down believing and there's going to be a
[1:59:58] time where there shall be no more death
[2:00:01] there's going to be a time where you and
[2:00:04] I are not going in the grave but we're
[2:00:07] going to meet the Lord in the air
[2:00:09] those that are dead and crash shall rise
[2:00:12] first and you and I will rise to meet
[2:00:15] them
[2:00:17] I think it's wonderful so the secret is
[2:00:21] in God
[2:00:22] then God comes and brings it out in
[2:00:25] simple form
[2:00:27] and then God comes and reveals it to
[2:00:29] whom it was for
[2:00:31] if the musicians would come thank you
[2:00:33] for your patience
[2:00:35] Hallelujah
[2:00:37] oh yes
[2:00:39] do you love him
[2:00:40] first it's with God
[2:00:43] secondly it's given by a prophet in the
[2:00:46] simple form and then thirdly
[2:00:48] God sends a prophet right at that time
[2:00:51] and reveals what the symbols are
[2:00:54] can you say Amen oh
[2:00:56] I'm gonna give you a little
[2:00:58] I'm gonna I'm gonna give you something
[2:01:00] that's gonna blow your mind
[2:01:01] well
[2:01:03] maybe not all of you
[2:01:06] at the end of Revelations
[2:01:09] John kneels down to worship the angel
[2:01:13] he's he's so he has so beside himself
[2:01:19] and the angel says don't do that get up
[2:01:22] get up get up
[2:01:23] y'all remember reading that
[2:01:27] I'll read it to you Revelations 22 and
[2:01:29] 8. and I John saw these things and heard
[2:01:32] them and when I had heard and seen I
[2:01:34] fell down to worship before the feet of
[2:01:35] the Angel which showed me these things
[2:01:38] then saith he unto me see thou do it not
[2:01:41] for I am of thy for I am thy fellow
[2:01:44] servant and of thy brethren
[2:01:48] the prophets
[2:01:51] and of them that keep the sayings
[2:01:54] of this book
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:01] God revealed it to John
[2:02:04] by a prophet
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:13] Prophets
[2:02:16] praise the Lord
[2:02:19] and can I can I just can I just can I
[2:02:21] can I just blow your mind some more
[2:02:24] after he told him to seal it up
[2:02:26] then the very next words and he saith
[2:02:28] unto me
[2:02:31] seal not to prophecies
[2:02:33] of this book
[2:02:37] oh
[2:02:38] I I have a feeling that it was I have a
[2:02:41] feeling it was probably the evening time
[2:02:43] Elijah I just have the I just have a
[2:02:46] feeling it was probably
[2:02:48] it was probably Elijah
[2:02:51] I have a Hallelujah this now this ain't
[2:02:55] this this ain't the Bible this is just
[2:02:57] my opinion I have a feeling
[2:03:00] that since Elijah
[2:03:03] that there are supposed to be this
[2:03:05] coming of Elijah to the Gentile Church
[2:03:10] I'll send you Elijah
[2:03:13] and you go back to Elijah and Elijah was
[2:03:15] the one that picked up all of the pieces
[2:03:17] of of the old amen of the old
[2:03:23] altar
[2:03:24] and the Bible says he put all the pieces
[2:03:27] back together
[2:03:31] and it was on the altar it was of it was
[2:03:34] on the put together
[2:03:36] of the old altar the restoration of the
[2:03:39] old altar
[2:03:42] fire came down
[2:03:44] you know I I just I just happen to
[2:03:46] believe that there's a special
[2:03:48] connection between that Elijah and this
[2:03:50] Elijah
[2:03:51] [Music]
[2:03:54] you love him
[2:03:57] I I just I I was I was in Pentecost and
[2:04:01] I I had to do a lot of believing it took
[2:04:04] a lot of believing for some for some
[2:04:06] stuff that was taught I mean I it took
[2:04:08] amen because I couldn't find it in the
[2:04:10] Bible but I'm sure glad that I I don't
[2:04:13] have to worry about anything these days
[2:04:15] I can find it in the Bible
[2:04:16] I can find where it is written can you
[2:04:18] say man what is it it's to give you a
[2:04:21] faith because it's going to require a
[2:04:23] faith greater than any other age it's
[2:04:26] going to be a it's got to be a perfect
[2:04:28] faith and brother I want to tell you
[2:04:32] still wrestling with well this one and
[2:04:34] that one and this one why don't you come
[2:04:36] back and look for Vindication and say
[2:04:38] God
[2:04:39] let me not miss the vindication
[2:04:44] oh I know there's a lot of good men and
[2:04:46] I know they claim a lot of wonderful
[2:04:47] things
[2:04:48] but brother
[2:04:49] God Is So Vindicated his man hold those
[2:04:53] 400 those 400 prophets out there they
[2:04:57] they they did hit they did hit it on
[2:04:59] occasion they did they were wonderful
[2:05:01] men bail them hit it on occasion
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:05] amen
[2:05:07] but he was a false prophet
[2:05:10] there's a lot of prophets out there
[2:05:11] there's a lot of good men good teaching
[2:05:14] why don't we go to the one it's hard to
[2:05:17] do
[2:05:18] because Satan's going to try to push you
[2:05:19] away from that
[2:05:21] Micah
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:25] he's going to try to push you away from
[2:05:27] that one that
[2:05:32] Ahab should have heated
[2:05:34] but he didn't
[2:05:36] it wasn't in his heart to heed
[2:05:38] but oh God
[2:05:40] I'm so thankful that you've given us
[2:05:42] your word
[2:05:44] open your word to me this morning
[2:05:47] I pray that you open your word to me
[2:05:51] oh don't let me don't let me think I
[2:05:54] know

[2:06:04] aren't you glad that God sends
[2:06:06] Messengers to us
[2:06:09] amen
[2:06:10] it's not important that you listen to me
[2:06:13] now now it is it is important God sends
[2:06:16] pastors
[2:06:19] but I've got to line up
[2:06:21] with with the messenger of that age just
[2:06:24] like every other age God did not appear
[2:06:27] unto he didn't say unto the angels of
[2:06:30] Smyrna I enjoy
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:37] if you look in the Bible there was never
[2:06:38] more than one major prophet on the earth
[2:06:41] at the same time
[2:06:47] Elijah had to go off the scene before
[2:06:49] Elisha Elisha's Ministry was second unto
[2:06:52] Elijah
[2:06:54] look at Moses look at Noah look at all
[2:06:56] of these others yes there were Minor
[2:06:58] Prophets
[2:07:00] that there was the major word prophet
[2:07:03] there are prophets in the body of Christ
[2:07:07] prophecies in the body of Christ there
[2:07:11] are tongues and interpretation Gifts of
[2:07:14] wisdom and knowledge in the body of
[2:07:16] Christ
[2:07:17] but only one Messenger to an age
[2:07:21] you all understand what I'm saying and
[2:07:23] God does that because he wants you he'll
[2:07:27] vindicate that you vindicate that gift
[2:07:30] not that you worship him but that you
[2:07:33] worship Him
[2:07:36] that you worship
[2:07:39] that it won't take us turn our thoughts
[2:07:42] from this and that and this and that
[2:07:46] an eternus to the realities
[2:07:49] of who this is
[2:07:51] for the word was made flesh and I say
[2:07:54] today

[2:08:08] I I know I I know a lot of us just got
[2:08:12] back from a to from a from a wonderful
[2:08:15] Jubilee but you see the reason why we
[2:08:17] can have those wonderful jubilees in
[2:08:19] those meetings because we know what
[2:08:21] they're saying
[2:08:23] we know what it's about
[2:08:28] and it takes guys like me

[2:09:08] could oh my the Bible says nothing but
[2:09:10] prophets amen
[2:09:14] that whisper
[2:09:19] by the prophet
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:23] of Malachi
[2:09:30] whoa can't you see
[2:09:34] why
[2:09:36] I'm happy
[2:09:41] I have accepted
[2:09:44] the word
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:52] the revealed
[2:09:55] [Music]
[2:09:57] that whisper

[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:46] come on
[2:10:48] [Music]
[2:10:51] what's up you kids May wonder why do we
[2:10:54] call this yeah you ever wondered why we
[2:10:55] call this the message
[2:10:57] like y'all ever thought about that maybe
[2:10:59] some of you don't
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:02] because the Bible is seeds
[2:11:09] and there's a designated time for each
[2:11:12] of these things to come to pass on its
[2:11:14] purpose
[2:11:17] so God shines his light
[2:11:20] on certain portions of scripture they're
[2:11:23] all good
[2:11:25] but Moses couldn't build a boat to go
[2:11:28] down into Egypt
[2:11:29] that light had already Shone now God was
[2:11:32] shining on this one right so the message
[2:11:36] of each age it was God coming to that
[2:11:40] age and Shining lights on scripture for
[2:11:44] that age
[2:11:46] now we all believe in it we all but you
[2:11:49] see there was a time it's hard to
[2:11:51] believe there was a time where the
[2:11:54] church didn't understand justification
[2:11:57] it took Martin Luther the light to shine
[2:12:01] because the word had been totally lost
[2:12:03] and it was all in uh
[2:12:08] what what was the language
[2:12:10] of the papal
[2:12:12] Latin fixing to say Italian Latin it was
[2:12:16] all and and but it took Martin Luther
[2:12:19] and the shining and that's when the
[2:12:21] Great Reformation of the just shall live
[2:12:24] by faith and justification
[2:12:27] but they all still smoke their pipes
[2:12:28] junked their alcohol they were as just
[2:12:31] as Loose as a Goose
[2:12:33] here come here come Wesley Shining Light
[2:12:36] on sanctification
[2:12:37] [Music]
[2:12:39] 1906
[2:12:40] outpouring of the Holy Ghost it was a
[2:12:43] light are y'all understanding so the
[2:12:45] message when we say the message what
[2:12:48] we're saying is we're living in present
[2:12:50] day it doesn't do away with any of that
[2:12:52] I'm still Justified I'm still Sanctified
[2:12:55] I still speak in tongues
[2:12:58] but God's given me the furtherance
[2:13:02] I'm glad for the message do you
