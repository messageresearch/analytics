[31:52] [Music]
[31:54] let's go ahead and turn to Romans
[31:56] chapter 13.
[32:15] Romans chapter 13 and we'll start at
[32:17] verse 12.
[32:24] the night is far spent the day is at
[32:27] hand
[32:28] let us therefore cast off the works of
[32:30] darkness and let us put on the armor of
[32:32] light
[32:33] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[32:36] in rioting and drunkenness not in
[32:39] chambering and wantonness not in strife
[32:41] and envying
[32:42] but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:45] and make not provision for the flesh to
[32:47] fulfill the lust thereof
[32:50] then we'll turn to Second Corinthians
[32:51] chapter 6.
[32:59] second Corinthians chapter 6 and we'll
[33:02] start at verse 4.
[33:09] but in all things approving ourselves as
[33:12] the Ministers of God in much patience
[33:14] and afflictions and necessities and
[33:17] distresses in stripes and imprisonments
[33:20] and tumults and labors in watchings and
[33:23] fastings
[33:24] by pureness by knowledge by
[33:26] long-suffering by kindness by the Holy
[33:29] Ghost by love unfeigned
[33:32] by the word of Truth by the power of God
[33:35] by the armor of righteousness on the
[33:37] right hand and on the left
[33:40] you may have your seats
[33:43] and we're going to go ahead and turn to
[33:45] Ephesians chapter 6.
[33:52] Ephesians chapter 6 and we'll start at
[33:55] verse 10.
[34:01] finally my brethren be strong in the
[34:03] Lord and in the power of His might
[34:05] put on the whole armor of God that ye
[34:07] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[34:09] of the devil
[34:10] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[34:12] blood but against principalities against
[34:14] Powers against the rulers of the
[34:17] darkness of this world against spiritual
[34:19] wickingness in high places
[34:21] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[34:23] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[34:25] in the evil day and having done all to
[34:28] stand
[34:29] there for having your loins gird about
[34:31] with truth and having on the breastplate
[34:33] of righteousness and your feet shod with
[34:35] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[34:37] above all taking the shield of Faith
[34:39] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[34:41] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[34:43] take the helmet of salvation and the
[34:45] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[34:48] God
[34:49] praying always with all prayer and
[34:51] supplication in the spirit and watching
[34:53] there unto with all perseverance and
[34:55] supplication for All Saints
[35:01] so we're going to be
[35:03] basically just having a little bit of a
[35:05] Sunday school class
[35:06] because I'm going to talk about the
[35:08] armor of God
[35:09] and
[35:12] Maybe
[35:14] the adults in the audience maybe you're
[35:15] just going to be along for the ride
[35:16] while I'm talking to the kids maybe I'll
[35:19] say something you haven't heard before
[35:21] we'll see what happens but the armor of
[35:23] God is something that is talked about in
[35:25] most every Sunday school class in some
[35:28] way
[35:29] um in fact when I started Sunday school
[35:32] teaching here it was one of the first
[35:34] series that I did for them was going
[35:36] through the armor of God
[35:41] brother Branham said in the sermon the
[35:43] greatest battle ever fought he said and
[35:45] so in Army first in getting ready for a
[35:47] battle first there's got to be
[35:50] a select some soldiers they've got to be
[35:52] dressed for fighting they've got to be
[35:54] trained for fighting and I believe that
[35:55] the greatest battle was ever fought is
[35:57] now ready to go in action I believe that
[36:00] God has been selecting his soldiers I
[36:02] believe he's been dressing them training
[36:03] them and the Battlefront is now
[36:06] set getting ready to start
[36:11] now as far as I understand
[36:13] um Paul when he was writing the book of
[36:15] Ephesians he was under house arrest in
[36:18] Rome
[36:19] he was a Roman citizen and not only did
[36:22] he have the opportunity to to watch
[36:24] Roman soldiers March around the city but
[36:27] he also knew that the Roman army was the
[36:30] most powerful of its day
[36:33] sister keys if you'd pull up that first
[36:35] picture
[36:38] even today if you look at history or
[36:42] look up what people talk about lecturing
[36:44] they will still hold up the Roman legion
[36:47] as being one of the most powerful armies
[36:49] of all time
[36:50] the Roman army was powerful forced due
[36:53] to their extensive training and their
[36:55] strong discipline
[36:56] fully trained Roman soldiers were the
[36:59] cream of the crop they were the best of
[37:01] the best
[37:04] so in this scripture it started off with
[37:08] and these are not to go ahead and
[37:10] preface this these are not listed in any
[37:12] order of importance as Paul's writing
[37:14] this so he's not saying the first one is
[37:17] the least important or the most
[37:18] important
[37:20] they're all important they all have
[37:22] different levels of importance so we're
[37:23] not going to say this is better than
[37:25] that
[37:26] but start off the first thing that Paul
[37:28] talks about is the belt of Truth
[37:31] the belt of a Roman soldier in Paul's
[37:33] day was not a simple leather strap such
[37:36] as we wear today I can look around and
[37:39] particularly for those that are wearing
[37:40] any type of church belt or dress belt
[37:43] it's this real thin belt going around
[37:45] that's really not meant to support much
[37:48] you're not meant to like clip a whole
[37:50] bunch to it to hold it or anything but
[37:52] the belts that the Roman soldiers would
[37:53] wear were very thick
[37:56] heavy leather and metal bands that would
[37:59] wrap around them they were designed not
[38:02] only to help provide protection but they
[38:06] were also designed to hold the Soldier's
[38:09] sword as well as to have the armor
[38:11] attached to it to help Provide support
[38:13] it provided a firm foundation for
[38:16] everything else that was being attached
[38:18] to it
[38:20] brother manham said in the sermon Israel
[38:22] in the church he said
[38:24] let's just take the loins girded about
[38:26] with a girl with a girdle
[38:28] that's the belt that holds the rest of
[38:30] it together gird your loins with truth
[38:33] in that day brother when there's all
[38:35] kinds of isms and fanaticisms it's time
[38:37] to gird yourself with the truth
[38:39] Jesus said I am the truth the truth I
[38:42] tell you when people say what about this
[38:44] what about that it's good to see that
[38:47] old truth buckled around you isn't it
[38:49] knowing where you're standing then stand
[38:51] there let them say well you have this
[38:53] that and the other you know where you're
[38:56] standing have the whole armor buckled on
[38:58] gird around here buckled down good and
[39:00] tight and pull down with the truth of
[39:02] God's word anchored in your heart all
[39:05] the devils in hell can't upset you
[39:06] that's right you can meet Satan say it's
[39:09] written hallelujah oh I tell you brother
[39:11] did you take up serpents no sir I
[39:13] believe Jesus Christ did you do this
[39:15] that or the other no sir I received the
[39:17] bathrooms of the Holy Ghost buckled
[39:19] about an armor on girded with truth
[39:23] and brother Randolph said in the sermon
[39:24] Redemption by power
[39:26] he said a man now when he comes into
[39:29] Christ he gets his gospel shoes on to
[39:31] preach the gospel the helmet of
[39:32] salvation on the breastplate of
[39:34] righteousness girds up his loins
[39:36] usually in the old Soldiers when they
[39:38] put on those ornaments of War they had a
[39:40] big belt they had buckled it together
[39:42] holding over their loins these shields
[39:45] keep the enemy Spears off what a real
[39:46] lesson that is to us and when the loin
[39:49] began to get weak hang down the shield
[39:51] they would tighten up on their belt to
[39:54] bring them up tight again what a perfect
[39:56] picture today when you begin to feel
[39:57] like you're you're slacking and the
[39:59] devil says it's no use reach down
[40:00] tighten up the belt a little bit pull up
[40:03] the sword a little tighter in the hand
[40:04] and go forward I like that be ready for
[40:07] the March
[40:09] the armor of God will not be supported
[40:11] by any falsehood Truth by its very
[40:14] definition is exclusive
[40:16] for something to be true it immediately
[40:19] means that other things are a lie or are
[40:22] false
[40:23] there is no mixture here these are the
[40:26] oil and water they don't go together if
[40:28] this is truth that can't be
[40:32] but yet nowadays we live in a day when
[40:34] people say that they can decide their
[40:37] own truth
[40:38] in the Washington Times on Wednesday
[40:40] October 20th in 2021
[40:43] there's an article that they're
[40:44] releasing Paul most Americans say truth
[40:47] is subjective no absolute right or wrong
[40:50] a quote from the article says we're just
[40:52] at a place in our country's history now
[40:54] where that's the default view most
[40:57] people would say all truth is subjective
[40:58] and there's no kind of objective truth
[41:00] based on an external standard they would
[41:03] say they're the standard that determines
[41:04] what truth is
[41:06] the poll says that 88 percent of adults
[41:08] in America craft a unique worldview
[41:10] fashioned from the personally appealing
[41:12] parts of other worldviews so they won't
[41:15] look at it and say that Christianity is
[41:17] truth they'll say well I like this part
[41:19] of Christianity
[41:21] or they'll even do it within the
[41:23] Christian world and say well like this
[41:25] of being a Baptist and I like this of
[41:28] being a Methodist and I like this of
[41:29] being a
[41:31] name off whichever denomination you want
[41:33] to I like this it being message
[41:36] I like this the following Brother random
[41:38] but I don't like that part
[41:40] I like this part of this I like that
[41:41] part of that
[41:43] they want to build their own truth they
[41:45] can't look at and just say this is truth
[41:48] this is what I'm building on this is the
[41:51] strong Foundation
[41:52] but like I said the armor of God can't
[41:54] be supported by falsehood if you want
[41:57] all the pieces to work together you have
[42:00] to have the truth to start with
[42:03] John chapter 8 and verse 44 it says
[42:06] year of your father the devil and the
[42:08] lusts of your father you will do he was
[42:10] a murderer from the beginning and a boat
[42:12] not on the truth because there is no
[42:13] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he's
[42:16] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[42:18] the father of it
[42:20] John chapter 17 starting at verse 15 it
[42:23] says I pray not that thou shouldest take
[42:25] them out of the world but thou should
[42:27] but thou but that thou shouldest keep
[42:29] them from Evil they are not of the world
[42:32] even as I am not of the world sanctify
[42:35] them through thy truth Thy word is truth
[42:40] and Romans chapter 3 and verse 4 God
[42:43] forbid yea let God be true but every man
[42:47] a liar as it is written that thou
[42:49] mightest be justified in thy sayings and
[42:51] might as overcome when thou art judged
[42:56] after
[42:58] the belt of Truth
[42:59] the next thing that Paul lists is the
[43:02] breastplate of righteousness
[43:05] now under the Roman Republic all the
[43:07] legionnaires wore a bronze cures
[43:10] consisting of a breastplate with a
[43:14] border of pendant leather straps
[43:15] defending the lower part of the body
[43:18] that comes from the encyclopedia
[43:19] Americana
[43:21] Strong's Concordance says that the Greek
[43:23] word used for breastplate is thorax
[43:26] now the breastplate was designed to
[43:28] prevent a blow from an enemy's sword or
[43:30] other weapon from reaching a soldier's
[43:32] vital organ particularly the heart it
[43:35] would be difficult to apply a death blow
[43:37] to the Torso of a soldier wearing this
[43:39] type of body armor a Roman soldier's
[43:41] breastplate is described by polybius as
[43:44] a bronze plate measuring a span every
[43:47] way which they wear on their breasts and
[43:49] call A Heart Guard or cardiofulax
[43:53] the breastplate was one of the most
[43:54] vital pieces of ancient armor because it
[43:56] shielded the wear from the main thrust
[43:58] and direction of the enemy's weapon it
[44:01] protected the vital organs
[44:05] second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[44:07] 21 it says for he have made him to be
[44:10] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[44:14] be made the righteousness of God in him
[44:17] brother random says in the sermon the
[44:19] greatest battle ever fought he says
[44:21] now listen All Ye soldiers now just
[44:24] before we start the prayer line
[44:26] take unto you the whole not just part
[44:28] the whole armor of God that you may be
[44:30] able to withstand in the evil day that's
[44:32] the day we're living in and having done
[44:35] all to stand
[44:36] when you've done all that you can do to
[44:39] stand then stand don't move stand there
[44:41] for having your loins listen to this
[44:43] listen here with us as your loins that's
[44:44] your middle part here see girded about
[44:46] with truth what is the truth the word of
[44:48] God that's right Thy word is truth and
[44:50] having on the breastplate of
[44:51] righteousness that is do what's right
[44:54] got the word of God in you doing what's
[44:57] right the breastplate of righteousness
[45:01] Romans chapter 6 and verse 16 it says
[45:05] know ye not that to whom you build
[45:07] yourself servants to obey his servants
[45:10] you are to whom you obey whether of sin
[45:12] unto death or of obedience unto
[45:14] righteousness but God be thanked that
[45:17] you were the Servants of sin but ye have
[45:19] obeyed from the heart that form of
[45:20] Doctrine which was delivered being then
[45:23] made free from sin you became Servants
[45:25] of righteousness
[45:27] you became
[45:29] servants that were doing what's right
[45:34] Servants of righteousness I speak after
[45:37] the manner of men because of the
[45:38] infirmity of your flesh for as you have
[45:40] yielded your members servants to
[45:41] uncleanness and to iniquity and unto
[45:45] iniquity and even so now yield your
[45:47] members servants to righteousness unto
[45:49] Holiness for when ye were the Servants
[45:51] of sin ye were free from righteousness
[45:54] righteousness is the quality of being
[45:57] morally right or justifiable
[46:01] so we have truth
[46:03] that's belted around the middle as the
[46:05] support for everything else
[46:07] you have the righteousness that covers
[46:10] all of your
[46:11] most vital organs it's the covering the
[46:15] area that the enemy is most likely to be
[46:17] thrusting at or slashing at the
[46:20] righteousness is what's covering this is
[46:21] what's protecting this area the
[46:23] righteousness of you living what's right
[46:26] and doing what God tells you to do
[46:29] brother Branham says in the sermon
[46:32] who do you say this is
[46:34] God makes it thus one to be so
[46:36] dishonorable to show up The Honorable
[46:38] ones one to be so far wrong it shows up
[46:42] if it wasn't that would be the right
[46:44] thing if there wasn't there cannot be a
[46:45] bogus dollar until there's a real dollar
[46:48] if you just made the bogus to begin with
[46:50] then it would be the real one but it's a
[46:52] copy there cannot be sin until there's
[46:55] righteousness because righteousness is
[46:57] the right thing and sin is the
[46:59] perversion of righteousness in other
[47:01] words a truth is a truth a lie can't be
[47:04] a lie until there's a truth first to
[47:06] pervert that truth into a lie so all sin
[47:09] is nothing but righteousness perverted
[47:11] therefore there's a system in the world
[47:15] Romans chapter 10
[47:18] and verse 9 says that if Thou shalt
[47:20] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[47:22] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[47:24] God hath raised him from the dead Thou
[47:26] shalt be saved for with the heart man
[47:29] believeth believeth unto righteousness
[47:31] and with the mouth confession is made
[47:34] unto salvation for the scripture saith
[47:36] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[47:39] ashamed
[47:42] second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 7. by
[47:46] the word of Truth by the power of God by
[47:48] the armor of righteousness on the right
[47:50] hand and on the left
[47:53] second Timothy chapter 4 and verse 8
[47:55] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[47:57] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[47:59] the righteous judge shall give me at
[48:01] that day and not to me only but unto all
[48:04] them also that love his appearing
[48:10] what if brother Branham said in the
[48:12] sermon it becometh us to fulfill all
[48:14] righteousness he says what difference
[48:16] does it make whether we got a nickel or
[48:18] a dime whether we got something to eat
[48:20] or whether we haven't whether we're
[48:22] living or Dying God promised the meek
[48:24] shall inherit the earth it behooveth us
[48:27] it's becoming to us that we live like it
[48:29] act like it must fulfill all
[48:31] righteousness God wants men and women
[48:34] who will stand and fulfill all
[48:36] righteousness and of course
[48:37] righteousness is his word
[48:41] righteousness is living his word
[48:42] righteousness is living what we know to
[48:44] be true what we know to be correct what
[48:46] we know to be what God is Desiring us to
[48:49] do
[48:55] brother random also says in a normal
[48:57] another sermon he says and righteousness
[48:58] is an attribute of Faith because you
[49:01] anchored in that Faith confirmation
[49:03] evidence
[49:06] now after
[49:09] the breastplate of righteousness
[49:13] in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 15 it says
[49:17] and your feet shod with the preparation
[49:19] of the gospel of peace
[49:25] if you would put up that second
[49:30] a Roman sandal during Paul's letters was
[49:33] called a
[49:34] and I may butcher this but a caligay the
[49:37] caligate were sandals that laced over
[49:39] the foot and up the leg
[49:41] the calendar were perfect for summer
[49:43] combat and high temperatures when the
[49:45] foot skin was not fully covered and
[49:47] could breathe the solid Soul guaranteed
[49:50] the stability and durability of the
[49:52] Footwear
[49:53] and the lightness and the workmanship
[49:55] did not burden the legs
[49:57] the openness of the caligan enabled the
[49:59] soldiers to wear them all day to work
[50:01] March stand in them for long periods
[50:04] without discomfort
[50:06] the leather strips were made so that
[50:08] they did not rub against certain parts
[50:09] of the feet and cause sores
[50:12] when marching through marshy ground
[50:13] rivers or streams the woven straps would
[50:16] allow the water to escape instead of
[50:19] keeping it contained within like a solid
[50:21] boot
[50:22] the underside of the caligate was fitted
[50:24] with studs which you can see in that
[50:26] picture
[50:27] Not only would they protect the soldiers
[50:29] feet over rough ground but they also
[50:32] helped to maintain stability when on wet
[50:34] or slippery ground
[50:39] brother Brandon said in the greatest
[50:41] battle I ever fought as he's describing
[50:43] the armor he says and your feet shod
[50:44] with the preparation of the gospel of
[50:46] peace
[50:47] go anywhere anyplace anytime feet shod
[50:51] with the gospel see
[50:54] now these
[50:56] sandals allowed them to have stability
[50:59] when they were fighting
[51:01] the same way that if you see any type of
[51:03] person playing professional Athletics
[51:06] now they have cleats
[51:09] I used to play baseball I had I had my
[51:11] ball cleats that I would play that would
[51:13] give me the grip as I was running along
[51:14] the clay if you see football players if
[51:17] you even see
[51:18] people playing golf have spikes on their
[51:21] shoes in order to have the better grip
[51:23] when they're driving
[51:24] the ball they still have they're still
[51:27] using that same idea to give them the
[51:30] stability that they need and so the
[51:33] Roman soldiers had these on there so
[51:35] that when they were on the battlefield
[51:37] they were not going to lose their
[51:39] footing they were not going to fall they
[51:41] weren't going to end up on the ground
[51:43] because once a soldier was on the ground
[51:45] the chance that they got up was not very
[51:47] high
[51:48] as soon as they were down they were
[51:50] vulnerable
[51:51] and so
[51:53] here Paul is describing this and he says
[51:56] your feet shod with the gospel of peace
[52:01] and so as you're going through life and
[52:04] dealing with all the stresses dealing
[52:06] with all the trials dealing with all the
[52:09] troubles that put us on this foundation
[52:12] and ground that isn't firm anymore
[52:15] God shots us with peace to say you can
[52:18] stand
[52:20] no matter how turbulent the waves no
[52:22] matter how stormy the Seas you can stand
[52:25] because I can give you the peace
[52:27] where you can stand on that uneven
[52:29] Terrain
[52:32] according to the American Institute of
[52:33] stress about 33 percent of people report
[52:37] feeling extreme stress
[52:40] 77 percent of people experience stress
[52:43] that affects their physical health
[52:45] 73 percent of people have stress that
[52:48] impacts their Mental Health
[52:50] 48 of people have trouble sleeping
[52:52] because of stress
[52:54] the global Organization for stress
[52:56] reports that 75 percent of Americans
[52:59] experienced moderate to high stress
[53:01] levels in the past month
[53:03] stress is the number one Health concern
[53:05] of high school students
[53:08] eighty percent of people feel stress at
[53:11] work
[53:15] major depressive disorder affects
[53:17] approximately 17.3 million American
[53:20] adults or about 7.1 percent of the U.S
[53:23] population ages 18 and older in a given
[53:27] year
[53:28] this is from a study they did in 2017. I
[53:31] couldn't find a study more recent but I
[53:34] feel like the numbers have gone higher
[53:37] major depressive disorder is more
[53:39] prevalent in women than in men
[53:41] that was found in 2003.
[53:44] depression is the cause of over
[53:46] two-thirds of the thirty thousand
[53:48] reported suicides in the U.S each year
[53:50] that's from 1999.
[53:54] I looked for newer data
[53:56] the fact they're not publishing it tells
[53:59] me the numbers are not getting better
[54:00] they're not pointing and going C we're
[54:03] improving things
[54:05] so if it was that bad
[54:08] in 1999
[54:10] that two-thirds
[54:14] of suicides are from depression
[54:16] most oppression comes from stress being
[54:19] built up over time
[54:22] what is it like today
[54:24] so why are we instructed to wear the
[54:27] sandals of the Gospel of the peace
[54:28] because in a world of stress depression
[54:31] and so much turmoil God is telling us
[54:34] how we can stand
[54:36] just as the caligate allowed the Roman
[54:39] soldier to have firm footing no matter
[54:41] what the terrain the gospel of peace
[54:44] allows us to have firm footing no matter
[54:46] what the trial no matter what we're
[54:48] going through
[54:49] second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 says
[54:52] for God have not given us the spirit of
[54:54] fear but of power and of love and of a
[54:57] sound mind
[54:58] Philippians chapter 4 and verse 7 says
[55:01] and the peace of God which passeth all
[55:04] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[55:06] Minds through Christ Jesus
[55:10] so we have Truth at the core that
[55:11] everything else gets attached to to make
[55:13] sure that the armor holds the way it's
[55:15] supposed to you have the breastplate of
[55:18] righteousness which is buckled to the
[55:20] belt of Truth which helps protect all of
[55:23] your vital organs and provides the
[55:26] barrier for where the enemy is normally
[55:27] going to be trying to hit trying to
[55:30] attack you have the shoes of the gospel
[55:33] of peace to allow you to stand no matter
[55:35] what the terrain no matter what you're
[55:38] walking through no matter what trial or
[55:40] what test may be happening you can have
[55:43] the peace to keep standing and keep
[55:45] walking
[55:48] obviously
[55:49] standing
[55:52] is kind of a big deal because when you
[55:54] go through this section of the verse it
[55:55] starts off by saying
[55:57] put on the whole armor of God that you
[55:59] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[56:01] of the devil
[56:03] and then wherefore taken to you the
[56:05] whole armor of God that you may be able
[56:07] to withstand an evil day and having done
[56:09] all to stand
[56:11] the very next verse stand therefore
[56:15] and then verse feed verse 15 having your
[56:18] feet shot with the preparation of the
[56:20] gospel of peace
[56:21] God is making it very clear you're
[56:23] supposed to be standing
[56:25] and the way you stand is because I've
[56:27] given you the peace to stand to keep
[56:31] going through to keep walking along the
[56:33] path
[56:40] after
[56:44] the feet shot of the preparation of the
[56:46] gospel of peace
[56:48] verse 16
[56:50] in Ephesians chapter 6 says above all
[56:52] taking the shield of Faith wherewith he
[56:55] should be able to quench all the fiery
[56:56] darts of the wicked
[57:00] Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 says now
[57:02] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[57:03] for the evidence of Things Not Seen for
[57:07] by it the elders obtained a good report
[57:11] and first John chapter 5 and verse 4
[57:13] says for whatsoever is born of God
[57:16] overcometh the world and this is the
[57:18] victory that overcometh the world even
[57:20] our faith
[57:22] now please excuse me this is probably
[57:24] going to be the section where a lot of
[57:27] you have already heard me talk about
[57:28] this because we had a New Year's service
[57:31] a couple years ago and I talked about
[57:33] the shield of faith and so a lot of this
[57:35] is in the same thing so if you're
[57:38] hearing it again I hope something's
[57:39] fresh
[57:40] but um sister if you put up the next
[57:42] picture so the Roman Shield was called a
[57:46] scutum it was a large rectangular curved
[57:49] shield made from three sheets of wood
[57:51] glued together together and then covered
[57:54] with canvas and leather
[57:58] this got him was light enough to be held
[57:59] in one hand and its large height and
[58:02] width covered the entire wielder making
[58:05] him very unlikely to be hit by missile
[58:07] fire and in hand-to-hand combat
[58:10] the metal boss or umbo in the center of
[58:13] the scutum also made it an auxiliary
[58:15] punching weapon when necessary
[58:18] some sources say that the tough tough
[58:20] leather on its own was resistant to fire
[58:22] arrows but other sources say that before
[58:24] going into battle Roman soldiers would
[58:27] dip their Shields into water in order to
[58:29] ensure that the wet leather could quench
[58:30] the darts of the enemy
[58:33] Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 26 says
[58:36] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[58:38] with the washing of the Water by the
[58:40] word that he might present it to himself
[58:42] a glorious church not having spot or
[58:43] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[58:46] should be holy and without blemish
[58:48] if we ensure that our Shield of faith is
[58:50] continually soaking in the water of the
[58:52] word then there's no chance that the
[58:54] fiery darts of the enemy
[58:56] can cause us any harm
[59:01] no this is probably my favorite part
[59:02] when I was studying out the shield but
[59:04] as strong as each individual soldier in
[59:07] the Roman army might be Roman troops
[59:09] always fought together in formation
[59:12] as a group and this made them especially
[59:14] powerful against less organized enemies
[59:16] who frequently fought with little
[59:17] formation
[59:19] one of the formations they used was
[59:21] called the testudo or the tortoise
[59:23] formation
[59:24] to the next picture please
[59:27] so in this testudo formation the men
[59:29] would align their Shields to form a
[59:31] packed formation covered with shields on
[59:33] the front and the top
[59:35] while this formation did reduce speed
[59:37] and mobility of the formation it offered
[59:40] consistent defensive strength against
[59:42] opposing infantry and excellent
[59:44] protection against arrows and other
[59:47] missile attacks
[59:49] the key was that
[59:51] and when I wasn't just me protecting me
[59:55] I was now standing there beside my
[59:57] brother to go here I've got this side of
[59:58] you and they were beside the next
[1:00:00] brother going I've got this side
[1:00:02] and then the ones that were behind us
[1:00:04] were lifting their Shields up over going
[1:00:05] here we've got above because you've got
[1:00:06] the front we'll make sure that your
[1:00:09] head's covered so you're not going to
[1:00:10] have the arrows raining down on top of
[1:00:12] you and so they became more powerful
[1:00:14] because they fought side by side as a
[1:00:17] group it wasn't an individual store
[1:00:20] Soldier it was the whole formation
[1:00:23] it was the body
[1:00:26] as a body of Christ were able to take on
[1:00:28] the enemy it's not us out on our own
[1:00:31] being hey I'm the Lone Wolf I can handle
[1:00:33] every single thing there God calls us to
[1:00:35] fight together with our brothers and our
[1:00:37] sisters
[1:00:38] and if they begin to get weak we're
[1:00:40] there to help cover the side we're there
[1:00:42] to help cover above them we're here
[1:00:44] there to help defend them
[1:00:46] with our Shields locked right with
[1:00:48] outside each other
[1:00:50] they knew that they could stand against
[1:00:52] whatever enemy was coming against them
[1:00:53] because they weren't facing it alone
[1:00:58] brother Brandon said in the sermon
[1:01:00] the mighty conqueror he says you know
[1:01:03] when the heat of the day is on the sheep
[1:01:04] all get together
[1:01:05] and they stand against one another and
[1:01:07] they make shade for each other and they
[1:01:09] support each other so that's the way the
[1:01:11] Sheep of God should do kind of Stand
[1:01:12] Together close places and support one
[1:01:15] another with our faith
[1:01:18] Psalms chapter 133 verse 1 says
[1:01:22] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[1:01:24] for Brethren to dwell together in unity
[1:01:27] it is like the precious ointment upon
[1:01:29] the head that ran down upon the beard
[1:01:31] even Aaron's beard that went down to the
[1:01:34] skirts of his garments
[1:01:38] brother Brandon said in the sermon life
[1:01:39] he said so what little I have got that
[1:01:42] he has given me I'm trying to share it
[1:01:43] with you Brethren see
[1:01:45] you're the church may we all just stay
[1:01:47] one see and just stay together as
[1:01:49] brothers and let's share what we got
[1:01:51] with each other
[1:01:53] that way we're in a great battle and
[1:01:55] we're battling sin not one another we're
[1:01:58] going to fight
[1:02:00] we're not going to fight at one another
[1:02:02] then Satan can set back and just let us
[1:02:04] fight it out see but let's turn our
[1:02:06] everything we got towards the kingdom
[1:02:07] put our shoulders one again with the
[1:02:09] other start moving upward and work for
[1:02:12] there because I don't think we got too
[1:02:13] much longer I think we're right at the
[1:02:15] end of the road maybe it's just because
[1:02:16] I'm getting to be an old man that I
[1:02:18] think that
[1:02:19] but no it isn't that because I thought
[1:02:21] that all the time I believe that we're
[1:02:22] at the end of the road and let's pray
[1:02:24] and help support
[1:02:27] in the sermon Christ is the mystery of
[1:02:30] God revealed love one another above
[1:02:33] everything love one another
[1:02:35] don't no matter what the devil tries to
[1:02:37] say now you're all one great big sweet
[1:02:39] group but remember my warning see Satan
[1:02:41] won't let that stay that way no sir
[1:02:42] he'll shoot everything if he has to
[1:02:44] bring somebody in to make his Target
[1:02:46] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever
[1:02:48] and sit him down and cause him to
[1:02:49] fellowship with you under the quietness
[1:02:51] and things and he'll shoot that guy with
[1:02:53] some kind of poison stuff it'll start
[1:02:55] through the church with it don't you
[1:02:56] take sides with it don't you have
[1:02:58] nothing to do with anything else you
[1:03:00] stay right loving and sweet and kind to
[1:03:02] one another pray for that man that he'll
[1:03:04] be saved or that woman or whoever it is
[1:03:06] just pray for them and stick one with
[1:03:08] another
[1:03:10] thank you
[1:03:24] after the shield
[1:03:26] going into verse 17 of Ephesians
[1:03:30] it says and take the helmet of salvation
[1:03:36] Isaiah 59 and verse 17 says for he put
[1:03:38] on righteousness as a breastplate and an
[1:03:40] helmet of salvation upon his head and he
[1:03:43] put on the garments of Vengeance for
[1:03:45] clothing and was clad with Zeal as a
[1:03:47] cloak
[1:03:48] first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse
[1:03:51] 8 it says but let us who are of the day
[1:03:53] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[1:03:55] faith and love and for an helmet the
[1:03:57] hope of salvation
[1:04:00] in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:04:02] brother Branham describing the helmet
[1:04:04] says how are you going to let this
[1:04:05] helmet what it does it's protection what
[1:04:08] is the helmet made out of brass brass
[1:04:10] can't even be tempered hard it's it's
[1:04:12] hard harder than iron a brass headpiece
[1:04:15] the Salvation knowledge of knowingness
[1:04:17] and my healing comes from God my
[1:04:19] salvation comes from God my experience
[1:04:22] matches his word not the church's idea
[1:04:24] the word amen there you are covered over
[1:04:26] with a protection the helmet of
[1:04:28] salvation Deliverance
[1:04:31] if you would pull up the next
[1:04:33] pictures keys
[1:04:38] the Roman helmet was known as a Galia
[1:04:41] it could vary quite a bit in design
[1:04:42] since Mass manufacturing didn't exist at
[1:04:45] that time and each helmet was created
[1:04:47] individually
[1:04:49] there was also some variation in the
[1:04:50] helmet design
[1:04:52] just during the life of the Roman Empire
[1:04:55] usually the helmets were made of metal
[1:04:58] although in the early days of the Empire
[1:05:00] some of the poor soldiers may have had
[1:05:02] leather helmets fortified with pieces of
[1:05:04] metal usually they were made out of
[1:05:06] metal
[1:05:07] the most obvious value of the helmet was
[1:05:09] to protect against blows to the head but
[1:05:11] it had two purposes protection and
[1:05:14] identification
[1:05:16] helmets usually had cheek plates to
[1:05:18] guard against blows to the face and a
[1:05:20] metal piece in the back to predict
[1:05:21] protect against blows to the back of the
[1:05:23] neck
[1:05:24] in addition during the early first
[1:05:25] century the helmet began to include a
[1:05:27] brow Ridge to provide protection for the
[1:05:29] eyes
[1:05:32] helmets worn by legionnaires and
[1:05:33] centurions had crests made of plumes of
[1:05:35] horsehair which were usually dyed red
[1:05:38] with the distinct nature of their
[1:05:40] helmets it was easy to identify these
[1:05:42] men in the midst of battle
[1:05:49] now when we think about
[1:05:51] the helmet
[1:05:54] normally when a man was fighting
[1:05:57] he was using the shield to block
[1:06:01] now because he was using the shield to
[1:06:03] block most of the blows that didn't mean
[1:06:04] that he went oh I don't need a helmet
[1:06:05] anymore
[1:06:07] the helmet was if he missed with the
[1:06:09] shield
[1:06:10] the helmet was for the shield got
[1:06:12] knocked away his sword got knocked away
[1:06:13] it provided that final bit of protection
[1:06:16] he didn't walk out on the field of
[1:06:18] battle with the helmet going great I can
[1:06:20] take all the blows to the head I want
[1:06:21] because I have a helmet
[1:06:23] that's not the thought process that's
[1:06:25] why you had a shield
[1:06:27] it's the same thing as on the job sites
[1:06:30] when the guys have to wear helmets at a
[1:06:31] construction site or whatever
[1:06:33] you're not going great I can let as many
[1:06:35] things fall in my head as I want because
[1:06:37] I have a helmet
[1:06:38] it's simply there in case something
[1:06:41] happens
[1:06:42] for those in baseball when they're
[1:06:44] wearing a batting helmet I'm not wanting
[1:06:46] to get a ball to the head but just in
[1:06:49] case I have the helmet the helmet there
[1:06:52] was at was there as a defense if the
[1:06:55] shield
[1:06:57] if they got around the shield if the
[1:06:58] enemy was able to get past that barrier
[1:07:01] they still had the helmet
[1:07:08] the helmet was projecting obviously
[1:07:11] The Head and the Brain it was to keep
[1:07:13] you functioning so that you could keep
[1:07:15] fighting
[1:07:16] if you didn't have the helmet one good
[1:07:18] blow you were gone
[1:07:21] the helmet allowed you to keep fighting
[1:07:23] if
[1:07:24] you lost your Shield
[1:07:27] if you missed a swing from the enemy you
[1:07:31] could take a hit and you could keep
[1:07:33] fighting
[1:07:36] now as I said the helmet was not just
[1:07:41] for protection it was also for
[1:07:42] identification because you could
[1:07:44] recognize particularly who your leaders
[1:07:47] were on the battlefield because each of
[1:07:50] the helmets looked a little bit
[1:07:51] different the plumes were put on just a
[1:07:53] little bit different and so you could go
[1:07:55] that's my commander that's where I need
[1:07:57] to stay this is the person I Dean to be
[1:07:59] around
[1:08:00] okay
[1:08:02] brother Brandon said in the sermon Jesus
[1:08:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:08:05] forever he said
[1:08:07] and then as we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:08:09] God and Joint heirs with him in the
[1:08:10] Kingdom
[1:08:11] then we express them in our lives
[1:08:13] sometimes if many of us would just live
[1:08:15] our sermons instead of preaching I think
[1:08:17] it'd be better if we just go ahead and
[1:08:19] live the sermon you know it's a lot
[1:08:21] better to live me one than it is to
[1:08:22] preach me one
[1:08:23] I believe because I can see your life
[1:08:26] God looks at your lives and the world
[1:08:28] looks at your lives he wants to know
[1:08:31] what our lives are and people know us no
[1:08:34] matter our actions are so loud it drowns
[1:08:36] out our testimony depends on what we say
[1:08:38] if we are Christians and don't live it
[1:08:40] then the people know better but when we
[1:08:43] are Christians and say we're Christians
[1:08:44] and live like Christians a lot Our Lives
[1:08:47] will do it if we never said nothing else
[1:08:49] our lives were written Epistles red of
[1:08:52] all men so they watch how you walk and I
[1:08:55] was thinking the other day about being
[1:08:56] sealed by the Holy Spirit a seal is
[1:08:58] marked on both sides they see you coming
[1:09:00] they see you going look like a Christian
[1:09:03] coming you look like a Christian going
[1:09:04] when you're sealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:09:09] so your salvation
[1:09:11] your salvation
[1:09:14] changes your life
[1:09:18] and people can see that they can
[1:09:20] recognize on the battlefield to go hey
[1:09:23] he's in that army
[1:09:27] he's not on he's not still fighting for
[1:09:29] this side
[1:09:30] he's not with the rest of the world
[1:09:31] finding that side there's something
[1:09:33] different he's got the plumes to Mark
[1:09:35] him out as he's in the Christian Army
[1:09:37] now
[1:09:38] whether he's on the job site and you
[1:09:40] don't say a word
[1:09:42] whether it's our sisters going through
[1:09:44] the grocery store
[1:09:45] being out and about
[1:09:47] people look at the lives and go wait
[1:09:49] there's something different there that
[1:09:50] doesn't match up with the rest of the
[1:09:53] people around them
[1:09:56] they can look at it and they can
[1:09:58] identify
[1:09:59] and that salvation not only is there for
[1:10:03] protection
[1:10:04] it also is an identification that anyone
[1:10:07] can look at and go there's something
[1:10:09] different there
[1:10:10] that's not what we see on everyone else
[1:10:13] that's not how everyone else Acts
[1:10:16] that's not how everyone else handles
[1:10:18] these situations that not that's not the
[1:10:20] response everyone else gives
[1:10:23] there's an identification there
[1:10:28] Romans chapter 10 and verse 10 says for
[1:10:31] with the heart man believeth unto
[1:10:33] righteousness
[1:10:35] foreign
[1:10:36] and with the mouth confession is made
[1:10:37] unto salvation
[1:10:40] for the scripture saith whosoever
[1:10:42] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:10:45] Isaiah chapter 12 and verse 2 says
[1:10:47] behold God is my salvation I will trust
[1:10:50] and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah
[1:10:53] is my strength and my song he also has
[1:10:56] become my salvation
[1:10:58] Psalm 62 and verse 1.
[1:11:01] truly my soul waiteth upon the Lord for
[1:11:04] him come from him cometh my salvation
[1:11:07] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:11:10] is my defense I shall not be greatly
[1:11:13] moved
[1:11:16] we have the shield of Faith up that's
[1:11:19] our main defense that's what protects us
[1:11:21] against their everything that we're
[1:11:23] facing
[1:11:25] but sometimes
[1:11:27] maybe you'll get a little bit weak and
[1:11:28] the faith drops just a little bit
[1:11:30] and the enemy is able to strike through
[1:11:33] but there's still the helmet of
[1:11:35] salvation that protects you
[1:11:37] your face shifted just a little bit
[1:11:39] okay we've gotta we've got to rebind
[1:11:41] we've got to strengthen gotta lift the
[1:11:43] faith back up but you didn't get lost
[1:11:45] because your faith dipped a little
[1:11:47] you didn't change it you the Salvation
[1:11:49] was still there the helmet of salvation
[1:11:52] didn't change
[1:11:53] just because the shield dipped a little
[1:11:57] now we're trying to train it the The
[1:11:59] Shield is light enough as we're being
[1:12:01] trained to hold it up so that it doesn't
[1:12:02] dip
[1:12:03] but if it does
[1:12:05] the helmet's still there you still have
[1:12:08] the protection
[1:12:09] to keep on fighting to go oh okay he
[1:12:13] rung my bell a little bit but I can lift
[1:12:14] my shield back up and I can keep going
[1:12:17] because that defense that salvation
[1:12:19] still provided the protection as I keep
[1:12:22] on fighting
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:27] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:12:29] sword of the spirit
[1:12:30] which is the word of God
[1:12:33] praying always with all prayer and
[1:12:35] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:12:37] there unto with all perseverance and
[1:12:39] supplication for All Saints
[1:12:46] in the sermon the greatest battle ever
[1:12:47] fought again
[1:12:49] brother Branham says what do you want to
[1:12:51] do then take the word what is the word
[1:12:54] the Bible said here we just read it for
[1:12:57] the spirit and of God is the word see
[1:12:59] look here and take the helmet of
[1:13:00] salvation and the sword the sword of the
[1:13:02] spirit
[1:13:03] the sword of the spirit what the spirit
[1:13:05] that comes in through your mind and
[1:13:07] enters into you and the sword of the
[1:13:09] spirit is the word of God what does that
[1:13:12] Spirit fight with how does the Holy
[1:13:14] Spirit fight with Sensations feelings
[1:13:15] the word
[1:13:17] Glory what does it fight with feelings
[1:13:20] the word let's say it word the word of
[1:13:24] God is what the spirit fights with the
[1:13:26] spirit of God walks right up to the
[1:13:28] devil and says it is written amen it is
[1:13:31] written and the devil gives way what do
[1:13:33] we do take the sword which is the word
[1:13:35] of God
[1:13:37] pull it with a hand of Faith a strong
[1:13:40] hand of faith
[1:13:41] the two-edged sword the Bible said in
[1:13:43] Hebrews 4 it's a two-edged sword Cuts
[1:13:45] both coming and going brother what does
[1:13:48] he do take the word take the spirit let

[1:14:37] Spirit making you feel all cut that
[1:14:38] thing away with the word of the Lord
[1:14:42] sister keys if you put up the next one
[1:14:48] the sword used by Roman soldiers was a
[1:14:51] short sword known as a Gladius
[1:14:53] and in the hands of a skilled man it was
[1:14:55] a fearsome weapon
[1:14:56] in fact it became known as the sword
[1:14:58] that conquered the world
[1:15:00] it was sharp sharpened on both sides
[1:15:03] making it lethal against unarmed
[1:15:04] unarmored foe the point was also
[1:15:07] sharpened enabling it to pierce armor
[1:15:10] usually it was only around 20 to 30
[1:15:13] inches long the Gladius was not the
[1:15:15] medieval style long sword that is
[1:15:17] usually associated with the armor of God
[1:15:20] if you go to any store and buy the armor
[1:15:23] of God Playset for your kids doesn't
[1:15:25] have the right kind of sword that is not
[1:15:27] the kind of sword that
[1:15:30] Paul was writing about
[1:15:31] this is what he would have seen on every
[1:15:34] single soldier's hip attached to their
[1:15:37] belt was the Roman Gladius
[1:15:40] the Roman sword was light only around
[1:15:43] two pounds
[1:15:44] short and designed to be wielded easily
[1:15:47] with one hand while the other hand
[1:15:49] grasped the shield
[1:15:51] its size meant it could be drawn in
[1:15:53] close quarters
[1:15:54] and its sharpened edges made it a threat
[1:15:56] to any enemy who got close
[1:15:59] Roman soldiers were trained to use the
[1:16:01] Gladius in tandem with the scutum or
[1:16:03] Shield
[1:16:04] the Gladius was mainly used for making
[1:16:06] quick thrusts or short slashes from
[1:16:09] around the scutum thus providing the
[1:16:11] soldier with the most protection
[1:16:13] possible
[1:16:15] they were trained to fight with the
[1:16:16] shield in front of them
[1:16:18] and just be reaching around
[1:16:20] and giving a quick stab or a quick slash
[1:16:23] and immediately pulling back behind
[1:16:25] their Shield again
[1:16:26] so that they kept
[1:16:28] the least amount
[1:16:30] of flesh out for the enemy to be
[1:16:33] striking at
[1:16:34] they were staying behind the shield as
[1:16:37] much as possible
[1:16:39] they would strike and immediately pull
[1:16:41] back strike again pull back
[1:16:44] The Shield stayed in the front
[1:16:47] The Shield stayed there as the
[1:16:48] protection but they could fight out as
[1:16:51] necessary
[1:16:54] Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.
[1:16:58] for the word of God is quick and
[1:17:00] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:17:02] sword
[1:17:03] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:17:05] Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[1:17:08] Marrow and as a discerner of the
[1:17:10] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:17:14] if you would pull that picture back up
[1:17:17] an infantryman in the Roman legion
[1:17:20] would also go into battle with a dagger
[1:17:22] a few Spears possibly a few darts which
[1:17:25] was a type of throwing spear
[1:17:27] but the Gladius was the only offensive
[1:17:30] weapon that was talked about by Paul
[1:17:34] it was also the main weapon in a
[1:17:36] soldier's Arsenal they might go into
[1:17:38] battle with these other things but this
[1:17:40] was the one they would rely on the most
[1:17:44] with Paul talking about the sword as the
[1:17:47] only weapon carried in the Christian's
[1:17:48] Arsenal Paul is making it clear that the
[1:17:50] sword of the spirit
[1:17:52] which is the word of God
[1:17:54] is the only weapon that we need to take
[1:17:56] on the enemy
[1:17:58] he didn't say all right here's your
[1:18:00] sword and then here's your dagger and
[1:18:02] here's your this that is no this is it
[1:18:04] this is all you need
[1:18:07] he knew the Roman soldiers carried more
[1:18:10] he had seen them marching around enough
[1:18:12] to know they had other weapons They
[1:18:15] Carried but Paul made sure to write
[1:18:17] about one
[1:18:18] this is it I don't need to try to stack
[1:18:22] you up with other weapons for long range
[1:18:24] for this for that it's this is what you
[1:18:27] have this is what you need
[1:18:29] the word of God covers it all
[1:18:31] it handles everything
[1:18:33] it will handle every attack of the enemy
[1:18:35] you don't need anything else he made it
[1:18:38] clear that the only weapon you need is
[1:18:41] the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:18:43] word of God
[1:18:47] in the sermon hearing ye him
[1:18:50] brother random says and the word of God
[1:18:52] will defeat the enemy any place anywhere
[1:18:56] at any time
[1:19:00] all the great power of God was in Christ
[1:19:02] he was God bodily
[1:19:04] God in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:19:07] himself but when he met Satan he never
[1:19:09] used any of his powers
[1:19:11] when Satan met him he said
[1:19:14] now
[1:19:16] if you're a miracle performer if you're
[1:19:17] the Son of God do a miracle here before
[1:19:19] me turn these stones to bread
[1:19:22] Jesus never used his power
[1:19:24] he used the father's word he said it's
[1:19:27] written man shall not live by bread
[1:19:29] alone
[1:19:30] then Satan came around and wanted to
[1:19:32] debate with him so he used the father's
[1:19:34] words too but he misused it put in the
[1:19:35] wrong place and Jesus said it is also
[1:19:37] written
[1:19:38] and every time Satan would come at him
[1:19:40] he'd speak with the father's word and
[1:19:42] defeated Satan on the father's word and
[1:19:44] you can do the same thing if you'll
[1:19:47] believe God's word and stand on God's
[1:19:49] word it'll defeat Satan every time
[1:19:57] so you have the loins Gert with truth
[1:19:59] this thick heavy belt
[1:20:02] that your other armor is fastened to
[1:20:04] that provides the stability
[1:20:07] we have to start with truth there's it
[1:20:09] can't be fast into falsehood you have to
[1:20:11] have the truth of God's word to begin
[1:20:14] with everything
[1:20:15] the breastplate of righteousness
[1:20:18] that attaches to that belt that you can
[1:20:21] strap down tightly that covers all the
[1:20:24] main
[1:20:25] areas that the enemy would try to attack
[1:20:28] the righteousness you living what's
[1:20:30] right doing what's right doing the
[1:20:32] things that God's instructing you to do
[1:20:35] feet shot with the gospel of peace so
[1:20:37] that you can stand on any terrain that
[1:20:39] comes along no matter what kind of trial
[1:20:42] what kind of test no matter what kind of
[1:20:44] mountain you're going through what kind
[1:20:45] of valley
[1:20:47] you have the peace to be able to tread
[1:20:49] through it
[1:20:51] it has the
[1:20:54] spikes on it that will dig into the
[1:20:56] ground it has the thick Souls that'll
[1:20:58] stand up to the rocks that you may be
[1:21:00] walking on
[1:21:02] you can go through
[1:21:04] the marshes you can go through
[1:21:07] the rivers you can go through the
[1:21:09] streams
[1:21:10] and the things of the world aren't going
[1:21:12] to cling to you they're able to run
[1:21:13] right out
[1:21:14] as you keep on walking and you keep on
[1:21:16] fighting because you can go through this
[1:21:19] terrain and you can handle whatever
[1:21:21] comes because you have the peace that's
[1:21:23] God given you to stand and to face the
[1:21:25] terrain
[1:21:27] you have the shield of Faith which is
[1:21:29] really the main defense
[1:21:32] the faith that you hold up that has been
[1:21:35] soaked in the water of the word
[1:21:37] that we've made sure that there's plenty
[1:21:39] of water plenty of word on it so that
[1:21:40] when the enemy's darts are coming at
[1:21:42] they're all going to be quenched
[1:21:44] and we can interlock those Shields with
[1:21:46] our brothers and sisters to defend
[1:21:48] each other
[1:21:49] that were more powerful standing
[1:21:51] together not alone but when we fight in
[1:21:54] formation side by side watching over
[1:21:57] each other
[1:21:58] is when we're at our best
[1:22:00] it's when we're able to be the mighty
[1:22:03] conquering Army moving forward
[1:22:06] the helmet of salvation
[1:22:08] that covers the head so that you can
[1:22:11] keep going and that is there
[1:22:13] for when you let that Faith slip a
[1:22:15] little bit
[1:22:16] when the enemy is able to get a blow in
[1:22:18] because that Faith dropped just a little
[1:22:21] it doesn't take away the Salvation the
[1:22:23] Salvation is still there to protect you
[1:22:25] to take the blow and you are able to
[1:22:27] recover and lift that Faith back up go
[1:22:29] okay I shouldn't shouldn't have dropped
[1:22:31] there should have kept that up
[1:22:34] and then we have the sword of the spirit
[1:22:37] which is the word of God which is what
[1:22:39] allows us
[1:22:40] to fight and to overcome every single
[1:22:43] thing that the enemy throws at us
[1:22:49] when the Army's put together they make
[1:22:51] sure to equip them with the best gear
[1:22:54] that they can
[1:22:55] and God looked and said okay this is my
[1:22:57] Army this is what you're going to be
[1:22:59] fighting so this is what I'm equipping
[1:23:00] you with this is what I'm making sure so
[1:23:03] that you can stand every test that comes
[1:23:05] along you can face every adversary you
[1:23:07] can fight against every trial against
[1:23:09] every test
[1:23:11] and you have the armor to protect you
[1:23:12] you have the weapon to fight back and I
[1:23:14] don't give you more than you need I
[1:23:17] didn't say oh you have to have all these
[1:23:18] different weapons that you have to learn
[1:23:19] it's no you've got the one
[1:23:21] you just have to learn to handle this
[1:23:24] use the word of God use the sword of the
[1:23:25] spirit that's what you use to fight the
[1:23:27] enemy it's just the one choice I don't
[1:23:30] have to think about should I use a bow
[1:23:32] here should I use a dagger here should I
[1:23:33] use a spear should I use swords no I
[1:23:36] have a sword this is what I use
[1:23:39] my captain equipped me he gave me what I
[1:23:41] need and this is how I'm gonna fight the
[1:23:43] enemy and this is how I'm going to
[1:23:45] overcome
[1:23:48] if the musicians will go ahead and come
[1:23:55] in the sermon faith without works is Den
[1:23:59] brother random says this that is the
[1:24:01] initial way of Divine Healing you know
[1:24:03] that
[1:24:04] the word of God will defeat Satan
[1:24:06] anywhere anytime on any conditions is
[1:24:09] that right
[1:24:10] when Jesus was here on Earth all the
[1:24:12] great gifts
[1:24:13] there was in heaven he had them right
[1:24:15] with him
[1:24:16] what the father was he was for he was
[1:24:18] God the son here on Earth
[1:24:20] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:24:23] to himself you believe that
[1:24:25] but when he met Satan he never used any
[1:24:27] of those powers
[1:24:28] he taken the father's word
[1:24:31] Satan said now if
[1:24:33] that question mark over the word of God
[1:24:35] again if thou be the Son of God command
[1:24:38] these stones to be made bread
[1:24:40] he said it is written man shall not live
[1:24:41] by bread alone right with the word take
[1:24:44] him up and when he tried to whitewash
[1:24:45] the word make it some other way he said
[1:24:47] it's written
[1:24:48] it's also written right back with the
[1:24:51] word of God tying Satan
[1:24:53] and then he taken him up onto the
[1:24:54] mountain showed him all the kingdoms of
[1:24:56] the world United States and all said
[1:24:58] these are all mine I'll give them to you
[1:24:59] if you'll fall down and worship me Jesus
[1:25:02] said it is written back to the father's
[1:25:04] word again none of his power just using
[1:25:07] the word showing that the weakest of
[1:25:08] Christians can defeat Satan on thus
[1:25:10] saith the Lord taking God at his word is
[1:25:13] that right
[1:25:16] and convinced and then concerned
[1:25:20] God to his army
[1:25:22] that he know in every nation tries to
[1:25:24] equip their army with the best they must
[1:25:27] do it to survive
[1:25:29] and God equipping his army being
[1:25:30] infinite know the best armor that there
[1:25:33] was and what did he do he give his army
[1:25:36] the word
[1:25:37] we're not fortified behind denomination
[1:25:39] we're not fortified behind groups we're
[1:25:41] fortified by the word of God
[1:25:45] and one last one and putting on the
[1:25:47] whole armor of God
[1:25:51] here's some time ago
[1:25:53] in the Army when our nation first
[1:25:54] provided a helmet oh my that little
[1:25:57] rookie didn't want to wear that it
[1:25:58] seemed unnecessary
[1:25:59] but when he got in battle he needed it
[1:26:02] God don't provide anything unless he has
[1:26:04] need of it everything that he provides
[1:26:06] for you you better take it because
[1:26:08] you're going to have need of it
[1:26:09] a little rookie with a 90 pound pack on
[1:26:12] his back in training he's got his new
[1:26:14] suit on you know he don't see any
[1:26:15] necessary packing that 90 pound pack
[1:26:17] with all these pick shovels hand
[1:26:19] grenades everything else but let him get
[1:26:20] in battle once
[1:26:22] time will come when you must have it
[1:26:24] that's right
[1:26:25] that's why the always God equipped his
[1:26:27] army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:30] he know these intellectual Giants would
[1:26:32] stand in this last day
[1:26:34] he know they'd stand and they'd be able
[1:26:35] to explain by their great wisdom powers
[1:26:37] of Satan
[1:26:39] Peter said they're like roaring lion
[1:26:41] defiring what we will
[1:26:43] but he said I'm not going to leave you
[1:26:44] comfortless I'm coming again I'm going
[1:26:46] to be with you
[1:26:48] he equipped his army with the baptism
[1:26:50] the Holy Ghost said go up there every
[1:26:51] one of you and wait
[1:26:53] behold I send the promise of my father
[1:26:55] upon you but Terry ye in the city of
[1:26:57] Jerusalem until you're endued with power
[1:26:59] from on high
[1:27:00] after this the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:27:02] you then you shall be Witnesses of me
[1:27:03] Jerusalem Judea Plum on down to the
[1:27:06] uttermost parts of the world
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:11] I know this wasn't anything
[1:27:14] amazing or earth-shattering this wasn't
[1:27:16] a lot of this is things that we've heard
[1:27:19] over the years
[1:27:20] we've heard about the armor of God and
[1:27:23] we've talked about it
[1:27:24] this wasn't the kind of sermon where
[1:27:26] it's going I'm going to put everyone on
[1:27:28] conviction and they're going to end up
[1:27:29] the altar
[1:27:31] but maybe it's just a little reminder
[1:27:34] how God takes care of us
[1:27:36] and how he equips Us and how we make
[1:27:39] sure that we have everything that we
[1:27:41] need to face the trials and tests that
[1:27:43] are coming along
[1:27:46] I don't know what trial and tests each
[1:27:48] one of you is facing I don't know what's
[1:27:51] going on in every single person's life
[1:27:55] but by the authority of the word I can
[1:27:57] tell you God's given you what you need

[1:28:34] I'd given them a dagger I wish I'd given
[1:28:37] them a bow
[1:28:38] he gave us everything we need
[1:28:41] to face the trials
