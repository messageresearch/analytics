[0:00] Christ our king.
[0:03] What a beautiful name it is.
[0:08] Nothing can stand against
[0:11] a beautiful name.
[0:15] the name of Jesus.
[0:35] The splendest
[0:55] was that
[0:59] hill of
[1:01] God.
[1:12] for you and me.
[1:18] Friend,
[1:26] then the ocean
[1:29] is dry.
[1:35] There's no
[1:44] sparrow
[1:47] fly
[2:01] in heaven.
[2:08] But there's no
[2:11] like
[2:29] in
[2:39] hanging by
[2:42] his side.
[2:48] And he spoke
[2:51] with love and
[2:54] compassion.
[2:59] that he took him
[3:02] to paradise
[3:10] world.
[3:19] The ocean
[3:22] is dry.
[3:27] There's no stars in the sky
[3:44] If that is
[3:53] heaven's
[4:01] feeling
[4:03] like
[4:10] that is
[4:12] enough.
[4:32] by
[4:34] his side.
[4:39] that he spoke
[4:43] with love and
[4:46] compassion.
[4:51] He took care
[4:54] to
[4:57] die.
[5:03] If that is
[5:06] a love
[5:11] then the ocean
[5:14] is dry
[5:19] and there's no stars in the sky
[5:27] where
[5:31] can't
[5:36] with
[5:45] heaven.
[5:53] There's no feeling
[5:56] like this.
[6:09] There's just no feeling
[6:13] like
[6:37] pres
[6:49] mighty power
[6:52] and his grace.

[9:31] of times.

[9:40] that we've been with the Lord.

[30:23] Sister Katrina's back there. She was
[30:25] really sick. And so good to have you
[30:28] tonight, Sister Katrina.
[30:32] And
[30:33] let's look here in in the scriptures uh
[30:36] here in Proverbs. We're going to we're
[30:39] going to be at the eth chapter. Start at
[30:42] the first verse. And um just good to see
[30:46] everyone here tonight. And um man uh so
[30:51] so thankful that the Lord had his hand
[30:53] on uh Sister Tina and and uh oh my
[30:57] goodness. Amen. She got there at 7
[31:00] o'clock. I think they had her on that
[31:02] ptocin by 7:30 and and uh uh she went
[31:06] for like
[31:08] 40 something hours and uh before she had
[31:11] that baby and and so we're sure glad
[31:16] that she uh she had that had had the the
[31:20] baby boy, a healthy baby boy, uh Ezra
[31:24] Martin. And so, uh, we're we're sure
[31:27] proud for for them and
[31:31] and, um, baby's healthy, mama's healthy,
[31:33] and so we're just really thankful for
[31:35] that. Amen. Uh, let's look here at
[31:38] Proverbs, uh, 8 and1.
[31:41] Doth not wisdom cry?
[31:44] Understanding put forth her voice? She
[31:47] standeth in the top of high places, by
[31:50] the way, in the places of the paths. She
[31:53] cries at the gates, at the entry of the
[31:56] city, at the coming in at the doors.
[32:00] Unto you, oh men I call, and my voice is
[32:03] to the sons of man. Oh ye simple,
[32:06] understand wisdom. Ye fools, be ye of an
[32:11] understanding heart. here. For I will
[32:15] speak of excellent things, and the
[32:17] opening of my lips shall be the right
[32:20] things. For my mouth shall speak truth,
[32:23] and wickedness is an abomination to my
[32:25] lips. All the words of my mouth are in
[32:28] righteousness. There is nothing forward
[32:32] or perverse in them. They are all plain
[32:35] to him that understandeth, and right to
[32:38] them that find knowledge. Receive my
[32:41] instruction and not silver, knowledge
[32:44] rather than choice, gold. For wisdom is
[32:47] better than rubies and all the things
[32:49] that may be desired or not compared to
[32:52] it. I wisdom dwell with prudence and
[32:56] find out knowledge
[32:59] of witty inventions. The fear of the
[33:02] Lord is to hate evil. Pride and
[33:05] arrogancy and the evil way and a forward
[33:08] mouth do I hate. Let's go to the Lord in
[33:12] prayer. Father, we want to thank you
[33:15] today for your blessings. And as Sister
[33:19] Amy was just singing the song, Show me
[33:22] Thy Way.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, that's the desire of all of our
[33:26] heart is that you would show us your
[33:29] way. Lord, we there's no limit, Lord, to
[33:35] wisdom and no limit to age. Lord, you
[33:39] anyone who's desiring you, Lord, you
[33:42] have said that you will give wisdom
[33:44] liberally to those who seek it. And
[33:47] Father, we're just asking that you would
[33:49] be with us tonight, that you would uh be
[33:53] the discerner of hearts and minds, that
[33:56] you would encourage and uplift. But
[33:59] Lord, we ask that you would build our
[34:01] faith to be more like you. Our desire is
[34:05] to be like you. Lord, give us a
[34:07] teachable spirit, Lord, and ears to hear
[34:11] in Jesus name. Can the church say amen?
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[34:17] seated here today. Amen. Glory to God.
[34:22] Well, God is good. Amen. Praise the
[34:25] Lord.
[34:27] So, we're going to continue our thoughts
[34:29] from last uh Wednesday night heeding to
[34:32] wise counsel and um uh council wise wise
[34:37] counsel is is so incredible.
[34:42] We've got a lot of knowledge in in the
[34:46] land today, but not there's very little
[34:49] wisdom. And uh um if if you were to read
[34:53] there in the book of Proverbs,
[34:56] uh Solomon, the greatest the wisest man
[34:59] outside of Christ to ever uh be live
[35:02] upon the earth. He was a he he spoke at
[35:07] great lengths, dedicated entire chapters
[35:11] &gt;&gt; to um to wisdom. And um uh and and
[35:18] there's just one thing that he wanted.
[35:20] Solomon wanted his son to be wise.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; And um he would he would say, "My son,
[35:28] hear the words of your father." And and
[35:31] and he would put a lot of emphasis.
[35:36] And um and when we talk about wisdom,
[35:40] it's again it's not knowledge, but it's
[35:43] an understanding to discern judgment as
[35:47] as the uh scripture would put it. An
[35:50] understanding to discern God when he
[35:53] when he uh dealt with Solomon, he says,
[35:57] "You've got a desire to understand to
[36:01] discern judgment." And so we the tree of
[36:04] knowledge can't produce this kind of
[36:06] wisdom. You can have a wise man um you
[36:11] know of this world can inv you know
[36:14] boast of his smarts. He can he can have
[36:16] wise money investments. He can have um
[36:20] um you know their counselors. They're
[36:22] doctors. They're scientists. They're
[36:25] religious people. Amen. But God's wisdom
[36:28] is not necessarily knowledge. And so I
[36:30] want us to understand that we want want
[36:33] knowledge. We're thankful for school.
[36:35] We're thankful for um those kinds of
[36:39] things because you've got to have it.
[36:40] And actually an education does teach you
[36:43] discipline. I mean it teaches you a
[36:44] whole lot of things and and and you
[36:47] don't look dumb to everyone in society.
[36:49] So that's always a good thing. And um so
[36:52] I believe that we do need an education
[36:54] in this in this society that we live in.
[36:56] Amen. But tonight, I'm not I'm not
[36:58] talking about I'm not going to just put
[37:01] a whole lot of emphasis on on education.
[37:05] Amen. Because um uh God's wisdom is far
[37:10] superior to the tree of knowledge. Um
[37:14] the the wisdom of God is all knowing.
[37:17] The wisdom of God is discerning. So as
[37:21] we are seeking counsel, you're you it's
[37:23] it's a wise man that seeks after
[37:26] counsel. Amen. You you can have you you
[37:30] can have the smarts and not wisdom. But
[37:33] you see, wisdom will always look Amen.
[37:37] at knowledge with discernment. It'll
[37:40] it'll always look at things with looking
[37:43] on both sides, seeing that seeing it all
[37:46] the way around. And so, amen, the the
[37:49] the wisdom of God, it it sees the end
[37:52] from the beginning. It will it does not
[37:55] see things at face value. Amen. It it
[37:59] but it recognizes and identifies even
[38:02] the spirit behind things. So, wisdom is
[38:05] is so incredibly in important. Now, uh
[38:10] you know, wisdom is knowledge as well.
[38:12] Amen. Uh uh you know, you but it's a
[38:16] higher knowledge. It's in it's in fact
[38:18] the source of knowledge.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam and Eve had a lot of
[38:23] knowledge. Amen. Adam and Eve had a lot
[38:25] of knowledge and they were eaten off the
[38:27] tree of life. But when they forsook the
[38:30] godly knowledge and went after amen the
[38:35] sensual knowledge, that's where they
[38:37] failed. Can you say amen? And so it it
[38:41] doesn't mean that that they didn't have
[38:43] understanding before because they did
[38:46] know God and they did fellowship with
[38:49] God. Amen. Adam and Eve, they were at
[38:52] the very source or Amen. they were at
[38:55] the source of the fountain of life, if
[38:57] you will. God, Amen, was everything to
[39:01] them. But you see, when they forsook
[39:03] God's wisdom and took on Satan's
[39:07] knowledge, and remember, Satan enticed
[39:09] him with knowledge. Amen. Well, you
[39:11] don't know everything. God knows that if
[39:13] you eat this, then you're going to know
[39:15] as he knows. Then they opened a whole
[39:18] new world. Knowledge opened up sin. And
[39:22] then before you knew it, Amen. things
[39:24] just went crazy. But God is still
[39:27] offering wisdom to every one of us here
[39:30] tonight. Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And and and so amen. I
[39:35] I I the the tree of knowledge was more
[39:39] tantalizing than the than the tree of
[39:41] life. And and therefore their eyes were
[39:44] closed to wisdom, open to knowledge.
[39:47] They could understand. And today today
[39:50] knowledge is incredible. Did you know
[39:52] that your brain is is is a huge
[39:56] computer? Did you know that your single
[39:59] brain my my my brain dummy me? Amen. Has
[40:04] more has has has more gigabytes in it
[40:07] than the biggest computer in the world.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. My mind now. Now so so you you you
[40:12] you want to you you want to understand
[40:15] God made your mind and you need to use
[40:18] your mind. But a mind without wisdom,
[40:22] well look around and lay ought to see
[40:24] it. Amen. We have a lot of smarts but no
[40:27] not not much wisdom. Can you say amen?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; So the human spirit and this what I want
[40:33] to continue talking to you young people
[40:34] on wise counsel. Somebody say wise
[40:38] counsel.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; We want wise counsel. God's put me here
[40:42] for a purpose. Amen. Human counsel is is
[40:47] looking at knowledge in a totally
[40:49] different way than the wise counsel.
[40:52] Human human counsel Amen. will give you
[40:56] uh uh uh you know, look for yourself.
[40:58] Look look out for yourself. Just don't
[41:01] you know uh put your interest above
[41:03] God's interest. But wisdom says,
[41:05] "Listen, I've been put here for a reason
[41:07] and I need to really be careful at what
[41:09] I'm doing." Can you say amen?
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I was I was looking there and I
[41:14] I I I thought I'd bring this I thought I
[41:17] could bring this in on the uh on the
[41:19] mind, the human spirit. You know it the
[41:22] the way it can dream, it can design, it
[41:25] can build, it can troubleshoot, it can
[41:27] find solutions. Your mind, it can store
[41:31] trillions of bytes of memory.
[41:35] Your brain's memory capacity is 2.5
[41:41] pabytes.
[41:42] Amen. Which is 2 and a half million
[41:47] gigabytes.
[41:48] you in your sebral uh uh cerebral uh
[41:52] core tech alone is 74 terabytes. Now, if
[41:57] you have a a fairly new computer, amen,
[42:00] you've probably heard of the phrase
[42:02] gigabytes and and uh megabytes and and
[42:05] and that sort of thing like that.
[42:08] Today's smartphone
[42:10] uh will have it's all measured by
[42:12] gigabytes. So, so your your the the the
[42:15] smallest of your your smartphones these
[42:17] days is going to have 16 gigabytes. Your
[42:22] um then it goes to 64 GB, 128 GB, then
[42:27] it goes up to 512 gigabytes of memory
[42:31] capacity. So, so I want you to really
[42:34] start to think your brain is 2.5
[42:38] pabytes,
[42:41] which is 2.5
[42:44] million 2 and a half million gigabytes.
[42:48] Now, my phone that I carry around, um,
[42:51] it's it's got, uh, I think that it's got
[42:54] 512 gigabytes. So, I've got twi 512
[42:58] gigabytes in that phone. And that phone
[43:00] is it's pretty smart, right?
[43:04] I It's got 512
[43:08] gigs. Your brain has two and a half
[43:13] million gigs of memory.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; So I want you to want you TO PUT THIS
[43:20] ALL in perspective here. Amen. And uh uh
[43:25] I I did you know that the operating
[43:27] system of the first Apollo uh spacecraft
[43:30] that landed on the moon in 1969
[43:33] it it only had 64 kilobytes
[43:38] which is much much smaller than a
[43:40] gigabyte. There are only there are a,024
[43:44] kilobytes in one gigabyte. So Apollo's
[43:48] computer could handle 64,000
[43:51] bytes or 64,000
[43:54] characters. Amen. I want you to catch
[43:57] this. The the the the system that put
[44:01] Amen. that that put the man on the moon
[44:05] did not even come close to having what
[44:10] your smallest cell phone would have
[44:12] today.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I I want you to catch that.
[44:16] Amen. Because the the the smarts, we are
[44:21] a very very smart people. Society is
[44:27] incredibly smart. But yet it seems like
[44:31] with all of our smarts and we have made
[44:33] these phones and these computers, amen,
[44:36] like unto us. And we we have all of this
[44:40] memory. We have all of this data. But
[44:43] yet this world is missing common sense.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; It's missing it's missing wisdom because
[44:51] it is missing God. They have put it all
[44:56] in in education and the smarts and have
[44:59] missed out on the most important thing.
[45:01] Well, can you say amen?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; SO YOUR AVERAGE smartphone is literally
[45:06] light years ahead of the computer that
[45:09] guided and controlled the spaceship.
[45:11] Apollo spacecraft was 64 kilobytes which
[45:16] is much much less than one gigabyte.
[45:20] Your average cell phone is 16 gigabytes.
[45:26] Amen. Which is which is 16 million
[45:30] kilobytes. Now I thought this was
[45:33] interesting too. IRS's own data uh
[45:36] warehouse, the man that keeps track of
[45:39] uh 300 plus million Americans and many
[45:42] uh more million businesses has the
[45:45] capacity of 150 terabytes of memory.
[45:50] Yahoo's
[45:52] um 2.1 pabyte pabyte computer system can
[45:56] process 24 billion events in one day and
[46:02] yet it is a full 20% smaller than the
[46:07] average human brain.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why Satan went for
[46:14] this.
[46:16] There's a reason why Satan
[46:19] has
[46:20] chosen in this generation, amen, to
[46:24] entertain this.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says God goes for the
[46:29] heart, but Satan chose the mind.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why the internet has
[46:37] has come in its Amen. in its prime. And
[46:40] there's a reason why that maybe most of
[46:44] you adults are addicted to phones and
[46:47] hopefully you children are not. Amen.
[46:49] You young people
[46:52] because phones have become such a way of
[46:56] life. Amen. Satan has chosen he has
[47:01] chosen the smarts to control man. And I
[47:04] would say that he has done a pretty good
[47:06] job at it.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:09] But yet, AMEN. WISE counsel is still
[47:14] there with us. I want you to think about
[47:16] it. Amen. Even in our in in our fallen
[47:19] condition. Amen. Mankind has mastered
[47:24] the planet with their spirits, with
[47:26] their minds, they they've got doctors
[47:28] and scientists and regular civilians are
[47:31] now uh flying into outer space. Amen.
[47:34] And and you see, you know, they we've
[47:37] got robots who can DO ALMOST ANYTHING.
[47:40] CARS THAT CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES. THEY
[47:43] THEY HAVE they have mimicked the human
[47:47] brain
[47:48] &gt;&gt; in such a way that it has almost
[47:50] misplaced
[47:52] man.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; But you see, GOD PUT MAN to control the
[47:58] earth.
[48:00] Not with your mind. Because a robot can
[48:04] do your job and maybe even better. Amen.
[48:08] YOU CAN GO YOU ARE Y'ALL understanding
[48:10] this? They have taken Amen. And they and
[48:13] and they have done such an incredible
[48:16] thing until uh uh uh they've got robots
[48:18] that can talk like a human, do the work
[48:20] of a human. Amen. That can do so many
[48:22] things. But they're lacking
[48:25] they're lacking wisdom.
[48:28] And this is where this is where college
[48:31] cannot help you. This is where Amen.
[48:34] school teachers cannot help you.
[48:37] Wisdom can only come through God and his
[48:41] counsel.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so wisdom is still calling out
[48:47] in the streets today. Wisdom is still
[48:49] saying, "Hey, hey, I'm here." Amen. She
[48:53] she is saying, "Listen to what I have to
[48:56] say and I will direct you. YOU'RE
[48:59] MISSING THE BIG PICTURE. I want you to
[49:01] understand what I'm saying." See, and
[49:05] so, so as we a as we look out there,
[49:08] Amen. The Bible says that wisdom can
[49:12] only come from God. The the the
[49:15] scripture even even said, "I have gained
[49:19] wisdom through thy commandments." Thy
[49:22] commandments have made me wiser than
[49:25] mine enemies. And so Solomon is
[49:29] describing, Amen. this actually
[49:31] describing WISDOM AS A WOMAN. AS A WOMAN
[49:34] CALLING OUT TO HER CHILDREN, HEY, HEY,
[49:37] you quit. Hey, come here. HEY, I I WANT
[49:39] TO teach you something. See? Amen. You
[49:43] But but yet you can't pick up the phone
[49:45] and call wisdom. You can't pick up the
[49:48] phone and Amen. a and talk to her. You
[49:51] see, wisdom is still calling. As as we
[49:55] uh, you know, as I go back over what we
[49:58] read at the beginning, Amen. And just
[50:00] and and I just picked out some of the
[50:02] stuff that she was that she was doing.
[50:03] You can hear it says, "Can you hear
[50:05] wisdom calling out? She stands in the
[50:08] top mountains at the junctions where the
[50:10] two ways meet, where decisions are
[50:12] made." Amen. Wisdom takes her stand at
[50:15] the entrance to the city, at the
[50:16] entrance of the doors. She cries out,
[50:19] "All you people, my voice is calling out
[50:22] unto mankind. You you you, oh you naive
[50:25] and inexperienced, get prudence,
[50:28] you who don't know, set your heart on
[50:31] me." Listen, I have trustworthy things
[50:33] to say. What I speak is right. ALL OF MY
[50:36] WORDS are true and just. None of them
[50:38] are wicked, crooked, or perverse. In
[50:41] other words, wisdom is there to direct
[50:43] us. Amen. It it's it's too direct. There
[50:46] in there in in Proverbs 8:15, it says,
[50:50] "By me kings reign, and princes decree
[50:54] justice. By me, princes rule, and
[50:58] nobles, and all the judges of the earth.
[51:01] I love them that love me. Those that
[51:03] seek me early shall find me. Riches and
[51:06] honor are with me. Yay, durable riches
[51:09] and and righteousness. My fruit is
[51:11] better than gold than fine gold. my
[51:14] revenue than choice silver. I lead in
[51:17] the way of righteousness in the midst of
[51:19] the paths of judgment THAT I MAY CAUSE
[51:22] THOSE THAT LOVE me to inherit substance
[51:25] and I will feel their treasures. The
[51:28] Lord possessed me in the beginning of
[51:30] his way before his works of old.
[51:34] I was set up from everlasting from the
[51:36] beginning orever the earth was. When
[51:39] there was no depths, I was brought
[51:41] forth. WHEN THERE WAS NO FOUNTAINS
[51:43] ABOUNDING WITH WATER, before the
[51:46] mountains were settled, before the hills
[51:48] was I brought forth, while as yet he had
[51:52] not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
[51:55] the highest part of the dust of the
[51:57] world. When he prepared the heavens, I
[52:00] was there. When he set a compass upon
[52:03] the face of the depth, when he
[52:06] established the clouds above, when he
[52:08] strengthened the fountains of the deep,
[52:10] when he gave to the sea his decree that
[52:13] the waters should not pass his
[52:15] commandment,
[52:16] when he appointed the foundations of the
[52:18] earth, then was I by him, as one brought
[52:22] up with him, I was his day, I was daily
[52:27] his delight, rejoicing always
[52:31] before him. Can you say amen?
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what God is showing wisdom.
[52:38] When God God was taking counsel with
[52:41] wisdom, God was counseling. So,
[52:45] in our in our everyday walk, we're going
[52:49] we're we want to make sure that we're
[52:53] seeking God's wisdom.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Now, if God had to consult with wisdom,
[52:59] Amen. Then I think the rest of us should
[53:01] have to consult with wisdom.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; And it's not in our learning. It's not
[53:07] in our understanding. It's the ability
[53:10] to judge, to discern. Discern before we
[53:13] talk. Discern before we act. Discern
[53:16] before we we we make decisions. Amen.
[53:19] Because only then can we know, Amen,
[53:23] that it that we're going to come out all
[53:26] right at the end. So, so the the the
[53:30] first thing that God done, he consulted
[53:34] with wisdom. Now, I thought that was
[53:36] interesting how that God would bring
[53:38] this in and you would go through all
[53:40] there there's several chapters where he
[53:42] is doing it. But what what what the what
[53:44] the uh the wisest man is saying is there
[53:48] is a lot of emphasis
[53:51] that that that is on on on wisdom,
[53:55] &gt;&gt; right? He was trying to teach his young
[53:57] man. Think about these things. Think
[54:00] before you take a job. Think before you
[54:04] uh you you look at a girl. Think before
[54:08] you before you Brother Brandham would
[54:10] put it this way. He would say, "Run your
[54:13] thoughts, your mind through God's filter
[54:16] of his word." Right?
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Always run everything through the filter
[54:21] of God's word because then and only then
[54:25] can you know that you're right. So
[54:29] anything that we do, any decisions we
[54:32] make, any any our our entire life should
[54:35] be run through this filter of his word.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; It should be run through the filter.
[54:41] Well, praise the Lord. You see, if if if
[54:44] you if you run your mind Amen. If you
[54:48] run that mind through God's filter,
[54:51] it'll it'll it'll it'll tell you. Amen.
[54:54] There's a lot of clickbait there on that
[54:56] on that internet. It'll tell you, Amen.
[54:58] You shouldn't you you shouldn't look at
[55:00] a woman uh uh that is, you know, in any
[55:04] way than a sister. And you should never
[55:06] look at it. You look at pornography and
[55:09] those kinds of things because wisdom if
[55:11] you see the endroduct of it. Amen. You
[55:15] you will have a marriage that'll
[55:17] struggle. Amen. And and and you'll go
[55:20] through life struggling even in your own
[55:23] self in your own mind fighting
[55:26] condemnation uh when you come to prayer
[55:29] when you fighting condemnation when you
[55:32] um uh uh when you're raising your
[55:34] families. They don't it'll always be
[55:35] there. So, so as a young man, as a young
[55:39] woman, and and and
[55:41] you you want TO ASK GOD, GIVE ME give me
[55:45] that judgment.
[55:47] Knowledge is all before me and it's and
[55:49] it's everywhere,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:51] &gt;&gt; And and and I can take knowledge and
[55:53] it's right there at my disposal. There's
[55:57] plenty of knowledge.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Plenty. But but the the originator
[56:02] of knowledge is sin.
[56:05] EVEN THE GOOD KNOWLEDGE WILL LEAD YOU
[56:07] away from the things of God. AMEN.
[56:11] BECAUSE IN OTHER WORDS, BECAUSE OF THE
[56:14] MEDICAL SCIENCE AND BECAUSE OF OF OUR
[56:17] HOSPITALS and things, are we seeking God
[56:19] more today or are we seeking God less?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Because we don't need God to heal us
[56:25] anymore like we used to have to depend
[56:28] on him.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; We just go to the doctor. We we don't
[56:32] need. SO NOW WE GOT COUNSELORS THAT WE
[56:35] WE JUST GOT WE GOT KNOWLEDGE EVERYWHERE.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; But with all of the knowledge, we've got
[56:40] a humanity that is sinking more in
[56:43] despair. But yet wisdom is still
[56:46] calling.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Oh you simple. Oh you simple ones. Amen.
[56:51] Oh you that that think you know it all.
[56:56] You're lacking in wisdom. Hear my voice.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hear my voice and I I will lead
[57:04] you. I will teach you the ways of God.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Wisdom. Wisdom. You
[57:11] mean you mean we can we can uh uh we can
[57:14] know for sure that God will give us a
[57:16] good marriage?
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Wisdom. If you seek the Lord, if you
[57:22] really seek after the Lord and and you
[57:25] ask the Lord, Amen. It'll it might save
[57:27] you a a lifetime of heartache. He seek
[57:31] his will. Amen. You don't want to be
[57:33] stuck with the wrong woman the rest of
[57:35] your life.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we sure don't
[57:37] believe in in divorces around here.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And uh well,
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Seek the Lord at the beginning.
[57:46] Seek the Lord at the beginning. you you
[57:49] know uh uh um before you take a job,
[57:52] wisdom will stand up as as you're you
[57:56] know as there's a lot of money coming in
[57:58] but you're going to have to miss the
[57:59] Wednesday night services. Wisdom will
[58:01] step up and say that's not according to
[58:03] the commandment. So wisdom will stand up
[58:07] and look at ALL THE ANGLES. HOW IS THIS
[58:10] GOING TO AFFECT ME? How is this going to
[58:12] affect my children? Amen. Well, how is
[58:14] this going to affect uh uh uh and I will
[58:18] say to you that's got the small the
[58:20] young families, those young ones, they
[58:22] grow up just like that. You'll blink and
[58:25] they will they will already be here.
[58:28] WHAT IF WHAT HAS WISDOM trained them?
[58:30] Because you're the only voice for
[58:32] wisdom. YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSONIFICATION.
[58:35] GOD IS CALLING OUT FOR WISDOM SO THAT
[58:38] she can live her life THROUGH YOU. GOD
[58:42] SOUGHT AFTER WISDOM AND THROUGH WISDOM
[58:46] he established the foundations of the
[58:49] earth.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[58:52] Am I making sense?
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Wisdom will tell you
[58:56] if you tell the lie. It it it'll it'll
[58:59] come back around somebody. Your sin, the
[59:02] Bible says, will always find you out. So
[59:03] wisdom takes you right back and says,
[59:06] "Yeah, but your sin will always come
[59:08] back to bite you. You'll never hide it.
[59:10] There is nothing hidden under the sun.
[59:13] So what you do in secret today, it might
[59:15] be 5 years down the road, it might be 10
[59:18] years down the road, WISDOM SAYS IT'S
[59:21] GOING TO come back.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Just tell the truth.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:28] Now,
[59:30] so and that's as we a as as we place
[59:34] value on wisdom, I think I I think there
[59:39] is something that begins to really
[59:41] transform into a heart because wisdom is
[59:46] teaching us to seek after God's way. And
[59:49] as we're being taught God's way, amen,
[59:52] God will begin to give us sound uh a
[59:56] counsel
[59:58] &gt;&gt; and he'll give us a pastor that'll
[1:00:00] preach the word. Amen. And that pastor
[1:00:03] because he wants wisdom. Amen. God's
[1:00:06] going to God's going to send him not let
[1:00:08] him go to a seminary, but God's going to
[1:00:10] send him a prophet that he can he can
[1:00:13] line up every belief system that he has
[1:00:15] with the word of God.
[1:00:18] Every one of us, we're basing it upon
[1:00:21] the word. You're not basing it upon me.
[1:00:24] You're not basing it upon mom and dad.
[1:00:25] You're not basing on anybody else.
[1:00:27] Though they are your teachers, though I
[1:00:29] am your pastor, you're not basing it
[1:00:31] upon me. Wisdom is instructing us
[1:00:35] through his counsel.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S instructing
[1:00:41] us. And because of that, Amen. Now, now
[1:00:45] I I I hope I hope you you're you're
[1:00:48] catching my thoughts here tonight. The
[1:00:50] brain is incredible and you can soak up
[1:00:55] a bunch.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] But knowledge is taking us further away
[1:01:03] from the Lord in many cases.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:11] If we heed counsel, we are we are put
[1:01:14] here to do to do for ministry. We are
[1:01:19] here for ministry.
[1:01:21] And we we are preparing to to be the
[1:01:25] tabernacle. And not just preparing to be
[1:01:27] the tabernacle, we are the tabernacle.
[1:01:29] If you've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:30] Ghost, you are the tabernacle of the
[1:01:32] Lord.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so I I love I love the way
[1:01:37] Solomon's dad I loved Solomon's dad. Who
[1:01:41] is Solomon's dad? Y'all y'all y'all
[1:01:42] remember who Solomon's dad was?
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Anybody know who Solomon's dad was?
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Man, you used to you used to have all
[1:01:50] the answers.
[1:01:52] Oh, you're giving these guys a chance.
[1:01:54] Amen. Hallelujah. Who was Solomon's dad?
[1:02:00] Hallelujah.
[1:02:02] Anyone know who Solomon's dad was?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. All right, you're going
[1:02:08] to have to bail us out.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; David.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; King David.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Was Solomon's dad. Amen.
[1:02:17] You better hope he's on y'all's team for
[1:02:19] the for for
[1:02:21] the Christmas uh quiz. So, so King
[1:02:25] Solomon had a dad and his dad was David.
[1:02:32] Now, David had taught Solomon, I want
[1:02:37] you to really be wise.
[1:02:40] Seek the Lord with all of your heart.
[1:02:44] Amen. All of your heart. Now, you're
[1:02:46] thinking, I knew that. Amen.
[1:02:50] So uh uh so David would would would
[1:02:55] teach him seek the Lord with with
[1:02:59] everything that was I I love I love
[1:03:01] Psalms 119 and 97. Oh how I love thy
[1:03:04] law. It is my meditation all the day.
[1:03:09] Thou thy commandments have made me wiser
[1:03:12] than mine enemies for they are ever with
[1:03:13] me. I have more understanding than all
[1:03:16] my teachers. For thy testimonies
[1:03:18] are my meditation. So here's David's
[1:03:21] given the secret to it. See, he placed
[1:03:24] value upon his word, upon that word. And
[1:03:28] so I would say we we want to place value
[1:03:32] upon godly learning. Place value. You're
[1:03:35] never too young
[1:03:38] to take an hour or so a day to turn the
[1:03:42] message on.
[1:03:44] Never too young. Listen to the message.
[1:03:48] Amen. And if you're not listening to the
[1:03:49] message, it shows it shows that you're
[1:03:52] not putting value on wisdom.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; We must put value upon what God values.
[1:04:01] God's picture was taken with our
[1:04:04] messenger.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; GOD CAME IN A CLOUD TO OPEN the seals to
[1:04:10] us. God's value, God's placed value on
[1:04:15] sending
[1:04:16] uh wisdom to us. Now it's up to us,
[1:04:20] every one of us. Now, now
[1:04:27] we can put so much emphasis on our
[1:04:29] phones and listening to everything on
[1:04:31] our phones and it's not. All you're
[1:04:34] doing is your mind is soaking up junk.
[1:04:37] God created your brain to be a sponge.
[1:04:41] God did. Your brain is not evil.
[1:04:45] IT'S WHAT WE PUT OUR FOCUS on that makes
[1:04:49] it evil.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; It's our fallen nature. SO WHEN WE COME
[1:04:54] to God, we ask God for his grace and we
[1:04:57] we're born again. Our desire is give me
[1:05:00] wisdom. And the only way we're going to
[1:05:02] gain WISDOM IN THIS GODFORSAKEN WORLD,
[1:05:05] LISTEN, wisdom isn't hiding. Wisdom is
[1:05:08] still SCREAMING IN THE STREETS, OH YOU
[1:05:11] SIMPLE. HEY YOU MEN. HEY BOYS, GIRLS,
[1:05:16] I'M CRYING IN THE STREETS. I'M CRYING IN
[1:05:18] THE BROADWAY. I'M CRYING AT AT AT THE
[1:05:21] INTERSECTION. I I'M I'M THERE. I'M
[1:05:23] SCREAMING OUT IN YOUR HOMES. I'M
[1:05:25] SCREAMING OUT EVERYWHERE. HEAR ME. HEAR
[1:05:27] ME.
[1:05:31] YES, SIR.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But because our brains are so filled
[1:05:34] with everything else.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; So give me wisdom. I got to have wisdom,
[1:05:44] Lord. I want to I want to be everything
[1:05:46] you want me to be. How many wants to be
[1:05:48] everything he wants you?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; You know.
[1:05:52] Amen. 1 Corinthians 1:24, Christ is
[1:05:55] identified as the power and the wisdom
[1:05:59] of God. 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ was
[1:06:02] made wisdom unto us in righteousness,
[1:06:05] sanctification, and redemption.
[1:06:06] Colossians 2 and 3, in whom are hid all
[1:06:09] the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[1:06:10] So when so Christ's desire, it's
[1:06:13] Christ's desire to give of himself
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; right
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; to us. Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] Now, uh, Job 28:12, "But where shall
[1:06:24] wisdom be found, and where is the place
[1:06:26] of understanding? Man knoweth not the
[1:06:28] price thereof, neither is it found in
[1:06:31] the land of the living." The depth says,
[1:06:33] "It's not in me." The sea says, "It's
[1:06:36] not in with me. It cannot be gotten for
[1:06:39] gold. Neither shall silver be weighed
[1:06:41] for the price of it. It cannot be valued
[1:06:44] with the gold of oper with the precious
[1:06:47] onyx or sapphire sapphire gold and the
[1:06:50] crystal cannot equal it. The exchange of
[1:06:53] it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
[1:06:57] And what does Satan want us to do? He
[1:06:59] wants us to go after the money. Go after
[1:07:01] the money, man. Let's go after the
[1:07:02] money. But wisdom is saying, hey, it's
[1:07:04] not in the money.
[1:07:06] It's a relationship with the Lord.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. James 1 and5.
[1:07:13] And if any man lack wisdom, let him ask
[1:07:16] of God
[1:07:18] that gives to all men liberally. How can
[1:07:22] it be? I looked under the earth and I
[1:07:24] can't find it. I looked in the seas, I
[1:07:26] can't find it. I looked all over the
[1:07:27] earth, I can't find wisdom. WE YOU WHERE
[1:07:31] WHERE is it? And yet God is giving it
[1:07:33] out liberally
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; for those who want it.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; You know what that tells us?
[1:07:39] There's not too many at once
[1:07:42] wise counsel.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:07:46] I'm asking that you help me.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Give me grace. Slap me upside the head
[1:07:52] if I need it.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; But let wisdom
[1:07:56] Amen.
[1:07:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; All right. So in closing,
[1:08:06] so David,
[1:08:10] it's his whole desire,
[1:08:12] his whole desire was to serve God. He
[1:08:15] was a kid
[1:08:18] that didn't, he was just he was just the
[1:08:20] youngest kid and and and and HE WASN'T
[1:08:24] AS STRONG AS AS THE OTHERS. WASN'T AS
[1:08:26] SMART as the other brothers. He was out
[1:08:28] in the pasture while the other brothers
[1:08:30] were out at battle. He was out there
[1:08:32] taking care of sheep. But his desire
[1:08:36] in that time of his life
[1:08:40] was I want to know the Lord.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And he sought after the Lord with all of
[1:08:46] his heart. He would write songs to God.
[1:08:50] He would ask God, "Help me." And he
[1:08:53] would he he was he was very and and and
[1:08:56] and he wrote these things down to where
[1:08:58] we could see a lot of his struggles on
[1:09:00] the inside. We could see a lot of the
[1:09:03] things that were going on. BUT HE WAS
[1:09:05] JUST RAW. HERE I AM. I need you. I'm
[1:09:08] needy. Oh God. I I I'M FORSAKEN WITHOUT
[1:09:12] YOU. ALL I WANT IS THEE.
[1:09:16] The world's against me. How many ever
[1:09:18] feels like the world's against you? How
[1:09:20] many of you young people ever feel that
[1:09:21] way? Come on, be honest.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I tell you what, I remember
[1:09:26] I remember when I was a teenager. Oh,
[1:09:28] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] It was rough. And and and and well, come
[1:09:35] to think of it, life is pretty rough
[1:09:36] today, too. But it was it was but it it
[1:09:40] WAS IN THIS YOUNG STAGE OF OF OF DAVID'S
[1:09:44] LIFE.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; YEAH. THAT WHEN THE STRUGGLES WERE THERE
[1:09:47] AND THE TEMPTATIONS WERE there and the
[1:09:50] and that he that he would that he would
[1:09:52] call out to God was washing his heart.
[1:09:54] Lord, I want to know you. Lord, you are
[1:09:57] my shepherd. I shall not want you. Lead
[1:10:00] me and guide me.
[1:10:02] It was it was his heart's desire.
[1:10:07] And the Bible says he pleased the Lord.
[1:10:10] He's had a desire.
[1:10:13] Now it's it's now it's it's it's now
[1:10:16] it's Solomon's turn. And so now he's
[1:10:19] David's looking to Solomon. Now stick
[1:10:21] with me a little longer. Now David's
[1:10:23] looking to Solomon there in in in 1
[1:10:25] Chronicles 22 and 12. And he says, "Only
[1:10:29] the Lord give thee wisdom." 22 and 12
[1:10:33] and understanding and give thee charge
[1:10:35] concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep
[1:10:36] the law of the Lord thy God, then thou
[1:10:39] shalt prosper. If thou takest heed to
[1:10:42] fulfill the statutes and judgments which
[1:10:44] the Lord charged Moses with concerning
[1:10:46] Israel, be strong and of good courage.
[1:10:48] Dread not nor be dismayed. And another
[1:10:51] place David later on down. Amen. He he
[1:10:54] gives him he gives him another charge
[1:10:56] again. Serve God with a perfect heart
[1:10:58] there in first chronicles 28-9. And thou
[1:11:02] Solomon, my son, KNOW THOU THE GOD OF
[1:11:06] THY FATHER AND SERVE HIM WITH A PERFECT
[1:11:09] HEART. and with a willing mind.
[1:11:13] See now he's passing it on. He's passing
[1:11:15] this on. I've come.
[1:11:18] For the Lord searchth all the hearts and
[1:11:19] understandeth all the imaginations of
[1:11:21] the thoughts. And if you seek him, he
[1:11:24] will be found of you. But if you forsake
[1:11:26] him, he will cast you off forever. NOW
[1:11:30] SOLOMON WAS TAKING THESE WORDS. Now um
[1:11:33] there's there's a there's a variety of
[1:11:35] opinions. Uh some some of the scholars
[1:11:39] says that Solomon was 12 when he began
[1:11:41] to reign. Others say he was 19 when he
[1:11:44] began to reign. But Solomon's desire HE
[1:11:48] WAS A YOUNG man and he was going to be
[1:11:51] the king over Israel and he couldn't GO
[1:11:54] BY HIS DAD'S SHIRT TAIL. SO HE HAD TO
[1:11:57] SAY HE NOT NOT IN THE SMARTS HIS DESIRE.
[1:12:00] AMEN. AS HE AS HE COME IN, HE WAS YOUNG
[1:12:04] and inexperienced, but he wanted to be
[1:12:07] taught of the Lord. And his only request
[1:12:10] from God as a young man was give me
[1:12:13] wisdom. We can read that in his prayer
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; there there in in first Kings 3 and 6.
[1:12:20] And Solomon said, "Thou hast shown unto
[1:12:23] thy servant David, my father, great
[1:12:25] mercy, according as he walked before
[1:12:28] thee in truth, and in righteousness and
[1:12:30] uprightness of of heart with thee, and
[1:12:33] thou kept for him this great kindness,
[1:12:36] that thou hast given him a son to sit on
[1:12:39] his throne as it is this day." Oh now
[1:12:43] and now, oh Lord my God, thou hast made
[1:12:47] thy servant king instead of David my
[1:12:50] father. I am but a little child. IN
[1:12:53] OTHER WORDS, I DON'T HAVE WISDOM. I
[1:12:55] DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE. I KNOW NOT HOW TO
[1:12:58] GO OUT AND TO come in. Don't know how to
[1:13:01] conduct business as a king. and thy
[1:13:03] servant is in the midst of thy people,
[1:13:06] which thou has chosen, a great people,
[1:13:09] that cannot be numbered, nor counted for
[1:13:11] the multitude. GIVE THEREFORE THY
[1:13:13] SERVANT AN UNDERSTANDING HEART TO JUDGE
[1:13:17] THY PEOPLE, that I may discern between
[1:13:20] good and bad? For who is able to judge
[1:13:23] this thy great uh so great a people? And
[1:13:27] the speech pleased the Lord. And Solomon
[1:13:31] had asked that that Solomon had asked
[1:13:33] this thing. AND GOD SAID, BECAUSE THOU
[1:13:36] HAST ASKED THIS THING, and has not asked
[1:13:39] for thyself long life, neither has thou
[1:13:41] asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked
[1:13:45] life of thine enemies, but hast asked
[1:13:48] for thyself understanding to discern
[1:13:51] judgment. Behold, I have done according
[1:13:54] to thy words. Oh, glory to God. I have
[1:13:57] given thee a wise and an understanding
[1:14:00] heart, so that there was none like thee
[1:14:04] before, neither after thee shall any
[1:14:07] arise like unto thee. I have also given
[1:14:10] thee that which thou hast not asked,
[1:14:12] both riches and honor, so that there
[1:14:15] shall not be any among the kings like
[1:14:17] unto thee all thy days. And if thou will
[1:14:20] walk in my ways to keep my statutes and
[1:14:23] my commandments as thy father did walk,
[1:14:26] I will lengthen thy days.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; The wisdom of a father is passed down to
[1:14:37] the son.
[1:14:39] Now,
[1:14:41] and I love this because
[1:14:44] Solomon surrounded himself with the wise
[1:14:47] men of his father.
[1:14:51] David's counselors,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; became the counsel to Solomon. Nathan
[1:14:58] the prophet estab helped established him
[1:15:01] as a king. The high priest come in and
[1:15:04] they were both so important.
[1:15:07] Amen. as establishing the that boy as a
[1:15:11] king in Israel.
[1:15:13] And and the Bible says that Solomon
[1:15:16] surrounded himself
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; with wise counsel.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Surrounded himself with wise counsel.
[1:15:30] Then Solomon was the one who wrote this
[1:15:33] in in Proverbs, all these proverbs about
[1:15:36] wisdom. I mean, he took and he would
[1:15:38] say, "Oh, my son," if you go back and
[1:15:39] look look there at Proverbs the 4th
[1:15:41] chapter, "My son, take heed to my words.
[1:15:44] Take heed to my wisdom." He's he's going
[1:15:46] through, he writes entire chapters,
[1:15:47] entire chapters. And now it's his son,
[1:15:51] Riaboam's turn. Now, Riaboam,
[1:15:55] the son of the most the wisest king to
[1:16:00] ever live, Riaboam is now going to take
[1:16:05] going to take the throne.
[1:16:09] Does anyone have any idea what Riaboam
[1:16:11] done?
[1:16:13] Amen.
[1:16:15] Riaboam
[1:16:18] took this majestic
[1:16:21] I mean through the wisdom of Solomon
[1:16:25] he made Israel a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:27] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:27] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:27] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:27] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:28] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:28] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:28] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:16:28] a a a a a a a a a a a a shining h a a a
[1:16:31] country. Amen. There was no one no king
[1:16:34] like unto Solomon.
[1:16:37] But you know what the Bible says that
[1:16:39] Briaboam done? Now there was some of the
[1:16:42] men that came to came to Riaboam and
[1:16:45] said, "Hey,
[1:16:47] your father
[1:16:49] has has taxed us a lot in making all of
[1:16:53] this that the tabernacle and making the
[1:16:56] the palace and building these things."
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; It's made our yolks heavy and it and and
[1:17:02] and
[1:17:04] can you can you help us? And he says,
[1:17:07] "Give me three days." And you can read
[1:17:09] this there in the book of you can you
[1:17:11] can read this there in um
[1:17:15] hallelujah I don't guess I I don't guess
[1:17:17] I brought it um but
[1:17:21] he he there were um he says give me
[1:17:24] three days and the Bible says he goes up
[1:17:28] to the counsel of his father the old men
[1:17:32] that gave counsel to his father and he
[1:17:34] talked to them what should I do and the
[1:17:38] The old men said, "If you will be a
[1:17:41] servant to Israel
[1:17:44] and you will listen to them and deal
[1:17:48] kindly with them, they will be your
[1:17:51] servants forever."
[1:17:57] He says, "Okay."
[1:17:59] But the Bible says before he even left,
[1:18:02] he forsook their counsel
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; and went to the council of his peers,
[1:18:08] the the boys that he was raised up in,
[1:18:10] the men that he was raised up in. Now,
[1:18:12] now I want you to catch this real quick.
[1:18:14] Hallelujah. Solomon was 12 years old
[1:18:17] when he began to reign, and he was wise.
[1:18:21] Riaboam was 40 years old and was a fool.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; He went and asked the the men of his uh
[1:18:32] uh of in his buddies that he grew up in
[1:18:36] and they says and and they told him,
[1:18:39] "Man, I wish I could remember which
[1:18:40] which chapter that is in. You could
[1:18:42] follow along." Amen. He says, "You tell
[1:18:45] those men, you tell Israel that that if
[1:18:49] you uh uh uh if if the finger if if the
[1:18:54] finger put a my father put oppression on
[1:18:57] you, Amen. then the then the width of my
[1:19:00] thigh will be the pressure now and
[1:19:02] you're I I if if he whipped you with
[1:19:05] with with cords, I'll whip you with
[1:19:07] scorpions." And he's and and he went
[1:19:10] back before him and and and so he
[1:19:12] started uh he man he started and he laid
[1:19:16] it out there and you know what happened?
[1:19:20] The 10 tribes pulled out of Israel that
[1:19:23] day and he was only left with Judah.
[1:19:29] his father, the wisest man, the man who
[1:19:36] God so used. AND HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF
[1:19:41] WITH THESE GREAT COUNSEL. AND THAT
[1:19:44] COUNSEL WAS HANDED to the new king, HIS
[1:19:48] SON RIABOAM. AND THEY GAVE HIM COUNSEL.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; And he refused it.
[1:20:01] and he lost the kingdom
[1:20:03] that day. Jeroboam
[1:20:07] took took the other 10 tribes and there
[1:20:10] he was with Judah. Now,
[1:20:15] and you could go on and he did not
[1:20:16] please the Lord. He did not seek after
[1:20:19] God. He did not Amen. and and and and
[1:20:23] then the Israel everything his father
[1:20:26] built.
[1:20:32] Listen guys, Solomon had Solomon had
[1:20:36] shields of gold. His soldiers had
[1:20:40] everything of gold.
[1:20:42] But it wasn't but just a few years
[1:20:45] and Egypt came in and cleaned them all
[1:20:48] out. and he had to go back and make uh
[1:20:52] uh uh shields and and armor of uh of
[1:20:56] brass and and he lo he lost everything
[1:21:01] his father had built up.
[1:21:05] I I just want I want us to really truly
[1:21:08] understand
[1:21:09] wisdom
[1:21:12] is not
[1:21:14] does not just go to an elder man. Wisdom
[1:21:18] does not go to a child. Wisdom
[1:21:22] is going to those who has a heart to be
[1:21:26] wise. Are y'all understanding what I'm
[1:21:28] saying? So, so my my my my thoughts here
[1:21:31] tonight is this. In all of my learning,
[1:21:35] I want a heart
[1:21:39] that is willing to be teachable.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Teach me thy ways.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; So, we could go through the scriptures.
[1:21:46] We could go all the way all down through
[1:21:49] time. Uh uh you you you could you can
[1:21:51] take instances all through there.
[1:21:54] Moses the the great the great the great
[1:21:57] prophet shepherd shepherd prophet God
[1:21:59] used him. There was no man like like
[1:22:01] like like uh uh uh Moses that God talked
[1:22:06] lip to ear to. And yet his father-in-law
[1:22:09] was telling him said, "Listen, you you
[1:22:12] you got this big heavy burden and and
[1:22:14] you're judging all of these millions."
[1:22:17] He said, "Why don't you take?" And Moses
[1:22:19] hearkened to the counsel of his
[1:22:23] father-in-law.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; He was able to sense. Okay? And the Lord
[1:22:29] honored him. Can you say amen?
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; You see, you see what I'm saying? So, so
[1:22:35] don't let it be. Don't don't let it be
[1:22:38] that we Amen. Uh uh don't
[1:22:43] train your heart at this young age.
[1:22:46] Lord, I I want I I want to be everything
[1:22:51] you want me to be.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; I want to be every I'm just a kid. And
[1:22:58] maybe you're you're saying, "Well, I'm
[1:22:59] just an elder. I'm just whatever." Amen.
[1:23:03] It should be our heart. And if you want
[1:23:06] wisdom, then you're going to seek after
[1:23:08] wisdom. Wisdom comes from his word.
[1:23:11] Wisdom comes through the message of the
[1:23:13] hour. Wisdom does not come
[1:23:18] through Amazon.
[1:23:21] Wisdom does not come through internet
[1:23:24] and YouTube. Wisdom does not come
[1:23:26] through those places. Wisdom comes from
[1:23:31] his word.
[1:23:33] Yes, sir.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, boy, I would never check
[1:23:37] my peers." What is your what what is
[1:23:40] your peers?
[1:23:42] Your your your peers could be the guy
[1:23:44] you you you four guys looking among each
[1:23:46] other and say, "Hey, you know, I mean,
[1:23:48] y'all could say, hm, well,
[1:23:51] I don't know. Uh, you know, dad dad says
[1:23:55] this, and the rest of you say, well,
[1:23:57] you're dead. I mean, come on."
[1:23:59] and and so, you know, you just blow off
[1:24:01] dad and and uh and that that's that's
[1:24:05] listening to your peers. But it goes
[1:24:06] beyond that.
[1:24:08] You've got something that I didn't have
[1:24:10] when I was a kid, and that's that stupid
[1:24:12] phone. And those those stupid games,
[1:24:15] those are peers. Those are things that
[1:24:17] have been brought up in your day. This
[1:24:20] is something that is there to counsel
[1:24:22] you. This is something that is there to
[1:24:25] keep you occupied. This is something
[1:24:27] that is there that I had to seek after
[1:24:31] the God of my father and that was my
[1:24:34] desire. Dad kept our our we we we didn't
[1:24:37] have a TV in our house. We didn't have
[1:24:39] those things. So So my focus I didn't I
[1:24:43] didn't have anything to take my
[1:24:44] attention.
[1:24:48] Hallelujah.
[1:24:50] And and I think I think I think it's a
[1:24:52] good thing that kids don't have phones
[1:24:54] until until they're ready to be adults.
[1:24:57] Let let them let them let them be there
[1:24:59] to where they understand what what what
[1:25:02] their WALK IS WITH GOD AND HOW THAT WALK
[1:25:05] SHOULD be there with God and and and
[1:25:08] have those things.
[1:25:11] It it's it's these things HERE THAT
[1:25:14] DIVIDES OUR ATTENTION FROM THE PURPOSE
[1:25:17] THAT GOD'S given us.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; So wisdom is still calling in the
[1:25:28] streets.
[1:25:31] Wisdom tonight is saying God still
[1:25:33] raises the dead. God still performs
[1:25:35] miracles. God still does all of that.
[1:25:38] Wisdom is saying
[1:25:40] who wants it.
[1:25:43] Wisdom is saying
[1:25:47] is it more than money? Is it more than
[1:25:48] gold? Is it more
[1:25:51] than internet time? Is it more than
[1:25:53] friends? Is it more than what do we
[1:25:56] want?
[1:26:00] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:26:04] The musicians would come,
[1:26:08] shine your light on me.
[1:26:11] Let the light
[1:26:14] from the lighthouse shine upon me. God's
[1:26:18] great, great light. It's that discerning
[1:26:20] light. It's that light.
[1:26:23] Do I need wisdom as pastor? Oh, I need
[1:26:27] more wisdom. Oh. Oh, I'm a foolish man.
[1:26:34] compared to what I need to be. I'm
[1:26:36] seeking for it.
[1:26:50] I don't know.
[1:26:54] It's the value
[1:26:58] a braille braille does wouldn't mean
[1:27:00] nothing to me and you.
[1:27:03] But to that blind person,
[1:27:10] braille means
[1:27:12] everything to them. That's how they read
[1:27:15] through through braille.
[1:27:20] So whether or not I would want it,
[1:27:24] I mean, yeah, cool. It'd be nice. It'd
[1:27:26] be nice to have Braille. I mean, be
[1:27:28] cool.
[1:27:31] But if you're blind,
[1:27:33] it ain't just nice and cool.
[1:27:36] It would be everything to you,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:45] I've told that story many of times about
[1:27:48] about that about that guy that uh uh
[1:27:51] mutton tape guy, you know, he was pretty
[1:27:53] good, but he was he he was a little
[1:27:56] squirly. He was really wiry and squirly.
[1:27:58] And uh so he came up to me one time and
[1:28:02] says, "Man, you should see my bazooka."
[1:28:06] And I said,
[1:28:09] "Bazooka?
[1:28:11] A bazooka is the last thing that you
[1:28:13] need. You don't need a bazooka. I I I
[1:28:16] know I let I said I don't even want to
[1:28:19] see it. He goes, "Oh, come on. Come here
[1:28:21] and look at my So, I go out there. I go
[1:28:24] out there to his car that was all
[1:28:26] falling apart. He couldn't even He
[1:28:27] couldn't even get in from the driver's
[1:28:28] side. He had to go around the other
[1:28:29] side. He couldn't even open it from the
[1:28:31] back. He had to climb over. But he had
[1:28:33] found this bazooka." and he gets this
[1:28:36] bazooka out and he hands it to me and
[1:28:38] it's just this piece of metal about that
[1:28:40] big and it's got knobs and things on it
[1:28:43] and I'm looking at that and I said,
[1:28:45] "That's not a bazooka." He goes, "Yes,
[1:28:47] it is." And he's grinning from ear to
[1:28:49] ear.
[1:28:51] He said, "How much you think that's
[1:28:52] worth?"
[1:28:56] It's heavy. I was looking at it. I
[1:29:00] didn't know what it was.
[1:29:03] I said, ' Man, I wouldn't give $5 if I
[1:29:06] seen that at a pawn shop.
[1:29:08] He You're kidding.
[1:29:11] This is worth $2500.
[1:29:16] And I gave 50. And I'm looking at his
[1:29:19] car thinking that $50.
[1:29:25] But see, he was a mud and taper. And you
[1:29:29] put mud in it, and then you have your
[1:29:31] tape on it. If he could just zip it
[1:29:33] around. He says, "I can make I can make
[1:29:35] thousands of dollars with this little
[1:29:37] thing here." No value to me. I would
[1:29:41] have passed it up,
[1:29:43] but it was valuable to him because he
[1:29:47] knew what it was worth. He knew that he
[1:29:51] could put it to work. And the world
[1:29:56] sees no value in wisdom.
[1:30:00] They just don't have value.
[1:30:04] But God's bride and he's got value. You
[1:30:07] know why? Riaboam is going to be the
[1:30:10] king was going to be the king and he he
[1:30:12] was a bad king. Riaboam was just a fool.
[1:30:15] He was foolish. Foolish.
[1:30:18] Squandered the kingdom. Squandered it.
[1:30:22] But did you know what the Bible says?
[1:30:25] But you and I are going to sit in the
[1:30:27] throne with Christ. We're going to rule
[1:30:30] and reign.
[1:30:32] Give make me wise, Lord. Give me
[1:30:34] counsel. Is that right?
[1:30:39] Shine on me,
[1:30:43] Jesus. Shine
[1:30:47] on me.
[1:30:50] Shine.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, let the light
[1:30:57] wise counsel.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Give me a Give me good heart. Give me a
[1:31:03] teachable spirit.
[1:31:06] Let it shine.
[1:31:10] Let it shine on me. Shine.
[1:31:18] Let the light
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; from the lighthouse.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Shine
[1:31:27] on me.
[1:31:29] Jesus. Shine.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Shine on me.
[1:31:41] Let the light
[1:31:44] from the lighthouse
[1:31:47] shine

[1:32:06] from the lighthouse.
[1:32:09] Shine.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:22] Amen.
[1:32:25] So that tells me that you don't have to
[1:32:28] be an old man.
[1:32:31] You don't have to be a preacher. All you
[1:32:33] have to be
[1:32:38] is see value in it.
[1:32:42] Man, if there's ever been a day that
[1:32:45] wisdom is crying, it is this day,
[1:32:47] Elelliana. It's this day. God's taken
[1:32:50] the veil off of the book and everything
[1:32:52] and he is screaming with wisdom is
[1:32:54] screaming with everything she's got
[1:32:58] because there's going to be an elect.
[1:33:00] We're going to see it. God wants us to
[1:33:02] see it. He's not trying to hide it from
[1:33:03] us. This is the day where the whole
[1:33:05] thing is unveiled.
