[0:00] Every beat will say,
[0:06] "Lord, I thank you for the life
[0:11] and thank you for the truth
[0:15] and thank you for the way.
[0:18] [Music]
[0:25] Hear
[0:27] [Music]
[0:30] each spirit
[0:32] sing.
[0:35] [Music]
[0:37] A song of praise.
[0:40] [Music]
[0:45] Those you have redeemed.
[0:53] We will use the words we know to tell
[0:59] you what
[1:02] awome God
[1:05] you are.
[1:08] But words are not enough
[1:11] to tell you of our love.
[1:15] Listen to our heart.
[1:20] [Music]
[1:30] And how do you describe
[1:38] a love that goes from east to west
[1:45] and runs as deep as it is wide
[1:54] all our hopes
[2:01] and you know all our fears.
[2:08] But words just can't express
[2:12] the love we feel.
[2:15] But we long for you.
[2:25] into our hearts.
[2:29] [Music]
[2:31] Hear our spirit. Sing
[2:35] [Music]
[2:39] a song of praise that flows
[2:46] from those you have redeemed.
[2:51] [Music]
[2:54] And we will use the words we know
[2:59] to tell you what
[3:03] an awome God you are.
[3:09] But words are not enough
[3:12] to tell you of our love.
[3:17] [Music]
[3:24] If words could fall
[3:31] from these lips,
[3:34] [Music]
[3:41] [Music]
[3:46] I would still run out of time.
[3:53] [Music]
[4:01] that every beat would say.
[4:08] Oh, I thank you for the life
[4:12] and thank you for this truth
[4:16] and thank you for the way.

[4:23] Won't you listen to our heart

[4:31] here
[4:33] singing
[4:38] a song of praise
[4:43] [Music]
[4:46] from the Lord you have redeemed.
[4:54] We will use the words we know
[4:59] to tell you why.
[5:02] Let aome God
[5:06] are
[5:09] words are not enough
[5:12] to tell you of our love.
[5:16] Listen to our heart
[5:23] when words are not enough
[5:27] to tell you of our love.
[5:34] [Music]

[18:14] Morning gentlemen, ladies.
[18:17] Just want to say that I think we all can
[18:20] agree today is a very special day for
[18:22] each of us because without the person we
[18:25] are celebrating today, we would not be
[18:28] here to give them thanks.
[18:31] And I just want to say thank you to my
[18:34] dad for always being there for me and
[18:37] just walking me through the stages of
[18:40] life.
[18:42] and he's always provided for us.
[18:46] And all the hard times, just whenever it
[18:50] got rough,
[18:51] you wouldn't really know it because he
[18:53] always tried to make it seem like
[18:55] everything was okay.
[18:57] That's something I very much respect
[18:59] about my dad.
[19:01] And I know not all of us do have our
[19:05] dads in our lives, but today is also a
[19:08] day we can just thank the men that have
[19:10] stepped up and taken that place.
[19:14] And I know it's tough for them, but
[19:17] at least there was someone to step up
[19:20] and someone you can thank today.
[19:24] And
[19:25] I would like to thank again the man who
[19:27] has just helped me out.
[19:31] He's taught me the work ethics and the
[19:33] empathy that a man should have and the
[19:37] respect that uh is supposed to be given.
[19:42] And he's taught me how to love and he's
[19:45] taught me how to just take care of
[19:47] myself as a person.
[19:49] And these are qualities only father can
[19:52] pass down to their sons and daughters.
[19:56] And growing up, I always just loved
[19:59] hearing his stories.
[20:01] I always be captivated by them. Just
[20:04] hearing about the days he used to be a
[20:06] rebel and just
[20:09] hearing about his story, how he came to
[20:11] God and just
[20:14] it just makes me love him even more and
[20:16] respect everything that he's been
[20:17] through.
[20:19] He sacrificed many different lives of
[20:22] fame and wealth just so he could live
[20:25] for God and raise a family like us.
[20:30] And I love the fact that he loves each
[20:33] and every one of us very deeply.
[20:36] And one day I wish to do that.
[20:41] But I also just want to take this time
[20:42] to say I truly love and I'm so thankful
[20:46] for the man that I call dad.
[20:50] And he to me
[20:53] is more than just a man. He's a true man
[20:56] of honor, sacrifice, and just love.
[21:03] And I just want to say for all of us,
[21:06] but especially to my dad, happy Father's
[21:09] Day. And thank you.
[21:13] [Applause]
[21:19] Amen. Did you enjoy that? Amen. All
[21:21] right, Sister Haven, we're expecting
[21:24] like sermon.
[21:30] Well, I know you guys are just jealous.
[21:34] I mean, I got a house in the country. I
[21:37] got ducks, dogs, chickens, cats, a
[21:40] four-wheeler. Papa bought the
[21:41] four-wheeler, but daddy said yes. So,
[21:44] yeah. Um
[21:46] uh but a thing I really appreciate about
[21:49] my dad is that um
[21:54] like He's always involved in every
[21:58] church function and he's not just off
[22:00] doing his own thing. He's
[22:03] helping. He's spending his time and his
[22:05] effort. And even though he's got a job
[22:08] and a business to run, he's always there
[22:11] for the church and he's always there for
[22:12] me when I when I need him. And you know,
[22:16] he's taught us that there's
[22:19] there's, you know, blessings and then
[22:22] there's, you know, rewards for putting
[22:26] your needs putting putting somebody
[22:28] else's needs before yours. And he's just
[22:34] been such a mentor to me. And
[22:38] um, another thing is that, you know, we
[22:42] don't have a lot of money, but the money
[22:44] that we do have, He's always helping the
[22:46] church and paying tithes and, you know,
[22:50] all that stuff,
[22:52] grown-up stuff. Um,
[22:56] but, you know, and then he's running a
[22:59] business and he's, you know, giving a
[23:02] lot of these men boys job jobs and
[23:08] you guys better be think I'm just
[23:09] kidding. I'm just kidding. But um
[23:17] um but I'm just really thankful that
[23:19] he's always been there for me and you
[23:23] know showed me what how to be a
[23:27] you know shown me how to be a good
[23:28] person and how to have a servant's heart
[23:32] and papa.
[23:35] Um
[23:37] there is he's always you know he taught
[23:40] me how to play guitar and all that. I'm
[23:42] not good at it but I know a song that's
[23:46] good enough. Um but
[23:49] um you know thinking of all the times I
[23:52] hated working with him
[23:56] but like I remember we pulled up we were
[24:00] driving with Sister Angie just last
[24:02] Tuesday and we drove by Suzan's and
[24:05] Devon was working with him. He was
[24:07] pulling weeds in the yard. And that took
[24:09] me back to a memory where, you know, we
[24:12] were in the car, we drove to Suzan's and
[24:14] I got out and papa hands me this five
[24:17] gallon bucket. Okay? And he hands me
[24:20] this little long thingy with a handle.
[24:22] And he goes, "I want you to pull out
[24:24] every single dandelion in this yard."
[24:26] Cuz he hates dandelions.
[24:28] And I'm over here so stupid. Why am I
[24:31] doing this? You know, all this stuff.
[24:33] I'm like, I'm never working with Papa
[24:35] again. Um but
[24:39] um but now I look back and I'm like he
[24:42] was trying to teach me something because
[24:43] now I'm working for Suzanne and now I'm
[24:47] pulling weeds, I'm doing the garden and
[24:49] all that and he was trying to teach me
[24:52] something and he gave me 20 bucks
[24:53] afterwards. So that was nice. But
[24:58] yeah, I'm really thankful for these two
[25:00] men and brother. Brother Wendle.
[25:05] Um,
[25:06] and a thing that I really appreciate
[25:08] brothers window is he's always always
[25:11] giving and he's always praying for you.
[25:15] And a time
[25:17] while we were at Austin's house and I
[25:20] thought he was going to help me, but he
[25:23] gave me a piece of sheetrock. He showed
[25:25] me how to do it and he's like, "Okay,
[25:26] you're on your own." Bing, bang, boom,
[25:27] done. Okay. And I'm like, "What? What
[25:30] are you talking about? I don't even I
[25:31] thought you were going to help me." He's
[25:32] like, "No, I got to do something else
[25:34] with the boys." you know,
[25:36] so you know, and I'm glad I had my
[25:39] sister and Linda help me, but I would
[25:41] have never got it done. But, uh,
[25:44] you know, he kind of taught me how like,
[25:48] you know, he taught me how to be
[25:49] confident in things I don't know how to
[25:51] do. Taught me how to like, even though I
[25:54] had no idea how to do it, I was like,
[25:57] "Okay, this is how long it is, and we're
[26:00] just going to cut." Okay.
[26:02] and I think it looks really good.
[26:06] And he just taught me how to, you know,
[26:10] be confident and even though I don't
[26:12] know how to do it, just, you know, just
[26:14] put my effort into it and it'll always
[26:16] come out good, you know.
[26:19] But these are the three men have really
[26:22] impacted my life. I know there's a lot
[26:24] of other men that impacted my life, but
[26:26] these are the, you know, one of the main
[26:29] three of the main ones. But I'm really
[26:32] thankful for my daddy and papa and
[26:35] brother Window for showing me how to be
[26:39] the best person that I can be. And I'm
[26:41] still learning, but I'm so thankful for
[26:43] these three men have taught me what I've
[26:45] learned, what I know now. And I'm just
[26:48] really thankful for them. Happy Father's
[26:50] Day. Wow.

[28:47] I call.
[28:52] Amen. God bless you, brother Aaron.
[28:55] Right after we have Sister Len come give
[28:58] her speech. Amen.
[29:04] Well, I don't got quite as much to say
[29:06] as Haven and Caleb, but
[29:10] I just want to say how much I appreciate
[29:12] and love my dad. and uh how he works
[29:16] hard and takes care of our family,
[29:18] provides for our needs and wants
[29:21] and
[29:22] he does stuff with us like take us
[29:25] shopping or go play games with us, take
[29:28] us outside, football, baseball stuff,
[29:33] golf
[29:35] that
[29:38] I really appreciate is that in the
[29:39] morning we do devotionals
[29:42] and just really appreciated that.
[29:47] And before we go to bed, he prays with
[29:49] us and just love hanging out with my
[29:53] dad. Love you. Happy Father's Day.
[29:58] [Applause]
[30:05] Jaden, appreciate my my eldest. Amen. I
[30:09] sure am proud of him and seeing the man
[30:11] he's young man he's becoming. I tell you
[30:13] does make me proud and and frustrated at
[30:16] the same time but I am proud of him.
[30:18] Amen. All right, Sister Len.
[30:26] Thanks a lot, Haven. But
[30:30] just want to say a couple things I
[30:31] appreciate with my dad. Well, a lot
[30:33] comes to mind, but one of them is my dad
[30:37] always takes me on dates. He get to
[30:39] dress up and he'll take me out to eat or
[30:41] go play game or and um we'll talk or
[30:44] laugh and we'll talk about who won last
[30:47] week's football game, but he always
[30:49] always listens to me and makes me feel
[30:52] special and important and always makes
[30:53] time for us and so thank you dad for
[30:55] that. Another like um if we need
[30:58] something or run out of something or
[31:00] he'll be quick and he'll um he'll
[31:02] provide for us and like he'll always be
[31:05] there for me. Thank you. Um
[31:08] even if it's just real small. But what
[31:11] stands out most to me is like his faith,
[31:14] his love for um for Jesus and how he
[31:17] works for God and has a walk with him
[31:19] and just a good example of what a
[31:20] Christian should be. And every time I
[31:22] look at him, I say, "That's what I
[31:24] want." And thank you. Thank you. Thank
[31:28] you, father. Say,
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:37] I appreciate that. Yeah, really good.
[31:40] Means a lot to me. And I uh she's my
[31:44] biggest critic. So, she'll let me know
[31:46] if something doesn't match or she where
[31:49] my hair is or she knows how to make
[31:52] money. Merl,
[31:53] she wants to wash my shoes, clean my
[31:55] shoes, but then she'll charge her 20
[31:57] bucks for it. So, yeah, be proud of her.
[32:01] Yeah, absolutely. I really appreciate
[32:05] all these these speeches so far. How
[32:07] about you guys? Amen.
[32:12] I'm gonna ask Brother Luke if he
[32:15] wouldn't mind coming and then right
[32:16] after him, Brother Austin.
[32:32] Good morning everyone. Well, uh I doubt
[32:36] my speech will be half as good as any of
[32:38] these other guys. I uh got home from my
[32:42] trip to Arizona and jotted down a couple
[32:46] bullet points and figured, well, here
[32:47] goes nothing.
[32:49] So,
[32:51] [Music]
[32:53] I think the two things that stand out
[32:55] most to me about my dad is his work
[32:58] ethic and his faith. And worth I got to
[33:03] see it better than a lot of other kids.
[33:06] I was able to work with him at
[33:07] Chick-fil-A for almost two years. And uh
[33:12] I got asked all the time, "So, what is
[33:14] it like working with your dad?" And
[33:17] honestly, after he left, it's like it's
[33:18] weird working without my dad. I enjoyed
[33:21] working with him so much. He was a great
[33:25] boss,
[33:27] great uh
[33:31] boy. He was a great boss, a great
[33:34] leader. He taught me how to do multiple
[33:37] things. He was there for me if I had a
[33:40] problem. There were certain things he
[33:41] couldn't help me with because he's my
[33:43] dad and that would be biased. But other
[33:46] than that,
[33:48] he's helped me at home. He's helped me
[33:51] through a lot of different projects that
[33:52] I was struggling with. I was about ready
[33:54] to just have a breakdown and quit. And
[33:57] dad would come and help me and comfort
[34:01] me and help me finish the project. And
[34:03] then he'd show me how to do it right
[34:05] because obviously I was doing it wrong.
[34:06] That's why I was it wasn't getting done
[34:08] right.
[34:09] He uh he's corrected me when I needed
[34:12] it. He's been such a great example. Um
[34:17] as many of y'all know, last March he
[34:20] lost his job at Chick-fil-A and I think
[34:25] his constant prayer looking for a new
[34:28] job that inspired me so much. He was in
[34:33] constant prayer seeking the Lord's will
[34:35] looking for this new job.
[34:40] He taught Bible study. He he started
[34:43] doing Bible studies with us in the
[34:44] morning.
[34:46] And unlike with most people, when they
[34:48] lose their job, it drives them farther
[34:50] away from the Lord. They're angry at
[34:51] him. They want to do something to take
[34:53] it out on God. It drove dad closer to
[34:55] him. and he had to turn down multiple
[34:59] jobs because it would either take him
[35:03] away from us for a long time or because
[35:06] he would have to miss church services.
[35:10] And as y'all heard his testimony, he had
[35:14] a job opportunity where he would have to
[35:18] work at least one Wednesday each month.
[35:21] And he was offered the job, but he
[35:23] turned it down. And
[35:26] I knew he wasn't going to take that job
[35:28] because my dad has a relationship with
[35:31] the Lord where he wouldn't do anything,
[35:35] but he would have to miss church.
[35:37] And then he got a call and he was
[35:41] offered the job at uh Stillwater
[35:42] Medical. He starts this Monday.
[35:45] So tomorrow really happy for him.
[35:52] One of the other men who have in this
[35:54] church who've greatly inspired me is my
[35:56] pastor, Brother Wendell. He taught me
[36:00] how to play guitar. Uh I play in church
[36:05] now, as y'all know. It's been a lot of
[36:08] fun. Um I've always enjoyed music, but
[36:10] until
[36:12] brother Wendell started those classes,
[36:15] it opened up a whole new world to me. I
[36:18] just love the world of music. It's
[36:21] amazing. He has been there. He's always
[36:26] praying for me and every single one of
[36:28] y'all here in the church.
[36:31] He's
[36:33] He was one of the men the Lord used to
[36:36] lead me to him.
[36:38] He was the one who baptized me.
[36:42] He's been such a great inspiration in my
[36:44] life. Such a great pastor. He the the
[36:47] amount of care he shows for the
[36:50] congregation has always struck me. I've
[36:53] been to a couple other churches, but
[36:55] I've never had a pastor like Brother
[36:58] Wendell. He has been such a great
[37:00] inspiration in my life, such a wonderful
[37:04] man of God. And then the third person I
[37:07] like to talk about is Brother Kobe. He
[37:10] is our youth leader. He leads Bible
[37:14] studies and he also has been such an
[37:17] inspiration in my life. The Lord has
[37:19] used his ministry to many things. There
[37:23] was a time where I had been hurt and I
[37:24] had built up so many walls and brother
[37:29] the Lord used brother Kobe's ministry to
[37:32] break down that walls and I'm closer to
[37:35] the Lord now ever been. the Lord. The
[37:39] Lord has used these three men to bring
[37:42] me closer to him. And I want to thank
[37:45] the Lord for giving me the blessing of a
[37:47] wonderful father, a wonderful pastor,
[37:50] and a wonderful youth leader.
[37:52] I love them all so much. They've been so
[37:55] good. The Lord has been so good to me.
[37:56] Happy Father's Day, everyone.
[38:00] [Applause]
[38:02] Amen. Did you enjoy that?
[38:05] Gotta say I've enjoyed Brother Luke's
[38:07] playing. Yes. Amen.
[38:11] God bless you, Brother Austin.
[38:15] Well, uh, we want to start out by saying
[38:17] happy Father's Day to, uh, all you
[38:19] fathers. Uh, there's a lot of you guys
[38:21] in here and, uh, we really appreciate
[38:23] you guys and, uh, everything you guys
[38:26] do, taking care of your family and, uh,
[38:28] raising your children and things. It's a
[38:30] real blessing for uh someone like me
[38:32] being a young man to look up to. And uh
[38:36] I guess the reason that I was um asked
[38:39] to give a speech is well I don't have an
[38:41] actual dad in the home but there's a few
[38:44] of us in here that don't have a dad and
[38:49] um it's you got you know Jonah don't
[38:53] have his dad. I don't have my dad. Devin
[38:55] and Daniel, they don't have their dad,
[38:58] but there's um there's people that have
[39:02] stepped up and they've taken that under
[39:05] taken that responsibility to help um to
[39:09] help lead these help take these guys
[39:12] under their wings. me being one of them,
[39:14] my brother. And um growing up, I without
[39:18] a dad in the home 24/7, I can see where
[39:21] there was a lot of times in different
[39:23] areas where
[39:25] it it w I would have maybe turned out a
[39:27] lot differently or maybe overcome things
[39:29] a lot quicker had I had a dad there in
[39:32] the home. Um, but the thing is is I def
[39:38] I I didn't have like even though I look
[39:40] at it and I know that biologically I'm
[39:42] fatherless, but I never looked at myself
[39:45] as fatherless. I never considered myself
[39:47] fatherless. I had men like brother Merl,
[39:49] I had brother Wendell. Um, and these
[39:52] guys that stepped up you, Brother
[39:53] Michael, a lot of times when we were a
[39:55] lot younger, we'd go stay with Sister
[39:57] Amy and he'd always, you know, help us
[39:59] out and things. And so there was a lot
[40:01] of these men that would help take us
[40:04] under their wings. And so here you have,
[40:07] you know, Devon and Daniel that, you
[40:08] know, they have brother Nathaniel and
[40:10] and Jonah, you know, he's brother Joe's
[40:13] kind of he's taking him under his wing.
[40:16] And uh it's it's a sacrifice for these
[40:19] men to to to do this, you know, to take
[40:22] somebody that's not they're not blood,
[40:25] but it's they see that there's a young
[40:27] man that's going to need he's going to
[40:30] need a way in life. And as you guys
[40:31] seen, some of you guys may have seen
[40:32] some of the statistics that were on the
[40:34] board. And there's a lot of, you know, I
[40:37] think it said like 80% of father or 80%
[40:40] of children that don't have fathers in
[40:42] the home, like there's 80% reduction
[40:45] that they won't go to jail and things
[40:46] like that. There's a lot of there's a
[40:48] lot of statistics and it's a big help
[40:50] and it's a sacrifice to see where these
[40:53] fathers will take these young men that
[40:56] don't have a a father in the home and
[41:00] help to raise them. And so there was uh
[41:03] you know, brother Merl, I mentioned him,
[41:05] there was um a lot of the times that he
[41:07] would help me. Some of the scenarios is
[41:09] we'd go to his house and he would always
[41:11] always have something for us to do. It
[41:13] didn't matter what it was, he was going
[41:15] to have something for us to do. We would
[41:16] either be plucking weeds like Haven or
[41:19] we'd either be picking up pecans or we'd
[41:21] be milking his goats or something. And
[41:24] thing is, if we're going to come stay at
[41:25] his house and we were going to eat his
[41:26] food, we were going to work for it. and
[41:28] he was going to make sure we were to
[41:30] work for it. And obviously at the time,
[41:33] you know, I'd go out there and I'd be
[41:34] plucking weeds and then I'd try to hurry
[41:36] up, get it done so I go eat cereal, you
[41:38] know, but it taught me something now,
[41:40] you know, looking at it from look, you
[41:42] know, being 19, I didn't really enjoy it
[41:44] at the time, you know, being seven,
[41:46] eight years old out there pulling weeds
[41:47] for no reason in the hot sun, I thought,
[41:50] you know, but now I look at it and it's
[41:52] uh it's something that taught me to if
[41:55] I'm going to ever eat, if I'm going to
[41:57] anything, be successful successful at
[41:59] anything, I'm going to have to work for
[42:00] it. And it was it was something that
[42:02] kind of stuck with me. And uh another
[42:06] thing, Brother Wendell, um he he's
[42:08] helped out a whole lot uh growing up
[42:11] because I, you know, he he lived right
[42:14] around the corner, you know, so if
[42:16] there's anything going on, you know,
[42:17] he'd always and which we were at his
[42:19] house all the time and so he'd always
[42:21] help out. But, uh, one of the biggest
[42:23] things that I think, um, stuck out to me
[42:26] that he helped me on is when there it
[42:29] was just me, mom, and Dylan in the home.
[42:33] And it, uh, sometimes we because, you
[42:36] know, you always hear people talk about
[42:38] that, you know, you hit the teenage
[42:39] years, you know, and some people that's
[42:41] not so much the case. For me, it was the
[42:43] case. I hit that teenage, I turned 13
[42:45] and I was ready to move out and
[42:46] everything. And uh I got really lippy
[42:49] with mom. And the thing is there wasn't
[42:51] an actual dad there in the home that was
[42:54] going to immediately correct me. And so
[42:56] I'd get lippy with mom and she'd be
[42:57] like, "Okay, I need you to make the
[42:58] bed." And so then I'd be like, "Well,
[43:00] okay, she's about to go to work at about
[43:02] 9:00, so it's 8:30. I'll go eat cereal.
[43:06] Then when she leaves, I'll have the rest
[43:07] of the day. I don't have to do the
[43:09] laundry. And then when or the the bed,
[43:11] and then when she gets home, I'll just
[43:13] shut the door and she won't see it. And
[43:15] then I'll just go back to bed and she
[43:16] won't even know." Well, things like
[43:19] that. It uh it wasn't very good habits.
[43:21] Well, Brother Wendell found out and I
[43:25] thought my world was about to turn
[43:27] upside down cuz he'd come up over I
[43:30] remember there's one time we sat out on
[43:31] the porch till like 11:00 in the morning
[43:34] or yeah 11:00 at night and he had Bible
[43:37] verses and you better obey your mom and
[43:40] things. And then there's another time
[43:42] where we were in his living room till
[43:43] like 1:00 in the morning. And obviously,
[43:47] just like brother Merl with him, I I
[43:49] didn't really enjoy it at the moment.
[43:51] But now you look back at it and you can
[43:53] see that well it was it was a man who
[43:56] seen a young man was going to need help
[43:59] and he's going to need guidance. And I
[44:01] didn't have that kind of a guidance that
[44:04] uh that a father could give in the home.
[44:06] I didn't have that at the home. But he
[44:08] took me under his wing and now and he
[44:12] taught me, you know, you're going to
[44:13] treat a woman right, you're not going to
[44:14] treat your mom like that. Well, and he
[44:17] and he teach me, you know, if you're you
[44:19] can't teach your or treat your mom
[44:20] right, how are you going to treat a wife
[44:22] right? Well, now I'm a married man. And
[44:24] and things like it just it's it's a
[44:27] blessing to me to be able to say that
[44:30] I've got men like this that have helped
[44:32] guide me because now I'm married and
[44:35] things. And it also gave uh gave me and
[44:40] me and my brother, it gave us a chance
[44:41] at life. Um he would always tell me, you
[44:44] don't have to be a statistic. And that
[44:45] was always one of the things that he'd
[44:46] always tell us after every one of those
[44:48] talks. He'd always say, now listen, you
[44:50] don't ever have to be a statistic. And
[44:52] you guys seen all those statistics. And
[44:54] he would say, you don't have to use it
[44:55] as a crutch and things. And so it's just
[44:58] a blessing. Um, and I know there's
[45:00] there's other of you fathers that have
[45:02] taken maybe children that weren't blood,
[45:05] but you taken them under your wings. But
[45:07] these are the two men that have helped
[45:08] me.
[45:10] And there's also another thing is they
[45:11] weren't so u they weren't so interested
[45:13] in just being a a disciplinary. One of
[45:16] the main things that they were good at
[45:18] is they were interested in just our
[45:20] everyday lives, which was a major impact
[45:22] in my life. They were interested in not
[45:25] just making sure that we grow up the
[45:27] right way and you better you better not.
[45:30] They were interested in our lives and
[45:32] you know working on the house over
[45:33] there. The the two men that were there
[45:36] the most was Brother Merl and Brother
[45:38] Wendell and they were going to make sure
[45:39] that that place was looking good and
[45:42] things and it I really appreciate you
[45:44] guys doing that. And uh so to all you
[45:47] fathers, happy Father's Day. And uh to
[45:50] you guys that are maybe raising your
[45:52] children that are raising children that
[45:54] might not be technically blood. It's a
[45:56] real blessing um to to those to those
[46:00] guys. They might not say it a whole lot
[46:02] and I may not have said it a whole lot,
[46:04] but it's huge blessing and we really
[46:06] appreciate it. And so God bless you all.
[46:14] Amen.
[46:16] I appreciate that that speech. Amen. And
[46:19] I I can relate with Austin on those long
[46:23] u talks.
[46:26] Me and me and Caleb had them. At least I
[46:28] know I had them. Josh was the perfect
[46:29] one. He uh he learn he he learned from
[46:32] me and Caleb's mistakes. But no, I do
[46:35] appreciate appreciate my dad. And
[46:38] looking back at all those times, I know
[46:39] it was out of love. And so I do
[46:42] appreciate him a lot. Amen. Can we stand
[46:46] to our feet before we get to the next um
[46:48] part of this program? And if you guys
[46:50] want to get out and greet one another,
[46:52] let's sing the song just real fast. God
[46:54] is good all the time. Let's do F. Yeah.
[46:57] God is good.
[47:00] Oh, all the time.
[47:04] He put a soul of praise in this heart of
[47:10] mine. God is good.
[47:14] Oh, all the time
[47:18] through the darkest
[47:20] night.
[47:22] Light will shine. God is good.
[47:28] Oh, God is good
[47:32] all the time.
[47:34] Oh, if you're walking,
[47:37] [Music]
[47:43] shadows
[47:44] all around.
[47:48] Do not fear.
[47:52] He will guide you.
[47:55] He will keep you safe. It's sound.
[48:17] Heat. Heat.
[48:20] [Music]
[48:51] for sinners. Oh, we were sinners
[48:56] so unworthy.
[49:02] chose to die
[49:06] and he filled me
[49:09] with his spirit.
[49:12] Now we can stand and stand
[49:17] by.
[49:19] Oh that his love
[49:22] is everlasting
[49:26] and his mercy
[49:29] they will never fail. God is good
[49:36] all the time.
[49:39] He put a soul of praise in this heart of
[49:45] mine. God is good.
[49:49] Oh, all the time.
[49:52] Through the darkest
[49:55] nights, his light will shine.
[50:02] Oh, God is good.
[50:05] Oh, all the time. Verse one. Can we do
[50:07] that again? Now if you're walking
[50:12] through the valley,
[50:15] there are shadows
[50:18] all around.

[52:26] I tuck him in bed and I kiss him good
[52:29] night. Tripping over the toys as I turn

[53:40] just can't get it all right.

[56:21] young people.
[56:23] And
[56:28] I think having children that love the
[56:30] Lord
[56:32] is is because of the of the men in their
[56:34] lives. And things could be so so
[56:38] different for so many if it hadn't been
[56:43] [Music]
[56:44] the dads uh in in their lives. I
[56:47] appreciate the dad in my life. I
[56:49] appreciate my father. And um today
[56:58] he he's battling Parkinson's these days
[57:01] and and um but that makes him no less of
[57:06] a man. He's a great great man in my
[57:09] books and and I I still highly love and

[1:03:24] thy mother,
[1:03:27] that thy days may be long upon the land
[1:03:30] which the Lord thy God
[1:03:33] shall give thee. And then it's repeated
[1:03:36] over here in Ephesians the sixth
[1:03:39] chapter.
[1:03:40] And um so we might we might just turn
[1:03:43] there as well. Ephesians
[1:03:46] u 6.
[1:03:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:56] And the first verse, children, obey your
[1:03:59] parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[1:04:03] Honor thy father and mother, which is
[1:04:05] the first commandment with promise, that
[1:04:07] it may be well with thee, that thou
[1:04:10] livest long
[1:04:12] uh on the earth. Now, let's go to the
[1:04:15] Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank
[1:04:16] you for your for your blessings and
[1:04:19] thank you for what you mean to us all
[1:04:22] and what fathers mean to us, Father.
[1:04:25] Lord, we ask that you would bless every
[1:04:28] one of these men in our lives and ask
[1:04:31] Lord that you would help me as as I uh
[1:04:35] want to say something to encourage them
[1:04:38] and strengthen the family. And we just
[1:04:40] pray Lord that you would be pleased in
[1:04:42] all that is done in the name of the Lord
[1:04:45] Jesus. Can the church say amen? Amen.
[1:04:48] And amen. God bless you. You can be
[1:04:50] seated.
[1:04:52] Amen. So we um as we
[1:04:57] uh talk about Father's Day, I I think of
[1:05:02] um there is nothing any greater than the
[1:05:07] family. And um I I like these these uh
[1:05:12] particular days because um we we get to
[1:05:16] um
[1:05:19] highlight the family a little bit more
[1:05:21] than what we would uh normally. But the
[1:05:25] first form of any of society was
[1:05:28] established and instituted by God. Amen.
[1:05:31] And it was the family. The family was
[1:05:33] the very very first institution
[1:05:37] that that was uh prescribed by God,
[1:05:40] ordained by God. And um and family is
[1:05:45] actually the it's the prototype
[1:05:49] of society
[1:05:51] because if you get the family where it
[1:05:54] needs to be, Amen. What the family is at
[1:05:58] home is what society will be.
[1:06:03] So when you see society
[1:06:06] messed up then it tells us that families
[1:06:11] in general are messed up and because the
[1:06:16] society is a reflection of family. Amen.
[1:06:21] It's it's the reflection of the
[1:06:22] conditions of the family. So society,
[1:06:27] Amen. Uh uh our our communities, our
[1:06:31] nation, our world is only as strong as
[1:06:36] the family is. So you I think family is
[1:06:40] is incredibly important. Family is again
[1:06:45] the very first institution. It's the
[1:06:47] foundation of of of God. So the the
[1:06:52] family institution,
[1:06:55] amen, is is the product of natural law.
[1:07:00] Now I know that there is a lot of
[1:07:02] interpretations today. Amen. Uh as to
[1:07:06] what a family is and they tried to
[1:07:09] legislate what a family is. They Amen.
[1:07:14] We, you know, they're trying to tell us.
[1:07:16] But you cannot legislate a family
[1:07:18] because you cannot legislate
[1:07:21] nature. You'll never legislate nature.
[1:07:24] Nature takes its course. Amen.
[1:07:27] Therefore, there is a father and there
[1:07:32] is a mother. Now, we don't need no law
[1:07:35] person, no senator, no congress, no no
[1:07:38] no no one in society to tell us what a
[1:07:41] family is. Now, now what is scary is
[1:07:44] look up Webster and and and uh and see
[1:07:48] what they have as the institution of the
[1:07:50] family. Father's not even mentioning
[1:07:51] that at all. You you can go look at all
[1:07:54] of your modern dictionaries at what they
[1:07:56] call family. It's a group of people that
[1:07:58] is living under one roof. That is not a
[1:08:00] family. A family is a father and a
[1:08:05] mother and have children. That is a
[1:08:09] family.
[1:08:11] Amen. Can can you say amen? So So they
[1:08:16] the the dictionaries today, all of them
[1:08:18] have all been revised or the ones that I
[1:08:20] looked into have been revised to where
[1:08:23] Steve and Tom can have a family or Sue
[1:08:26] and Anne can have a family. No, you'll
[1:08:29] never change the meaning of family.
[1:08:32] You'll never change the honor of family.
[1:08:36] Family starts with a father.
[1:08:40] Someone say, "Father." Father. Amen.
[1:08:43] You'll never take the the the the need
[1:08:47] of of a father out. Now, I and I
[1:08:50] appreciate it as we as as as as Austin
[1:08:54] uh uh brought it. I I appreciated every
[1:08:57] one of those uh speeches. They were just
[1:09:00] very right on right right on uh course.
[1:09:03] And and every one of you done a good
[1:09:05] Let's give them guys all a good hand
[1:09:07] again.
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:11] And u I I I I get a little nervous on
[1:09:14] these kind of programs and so I'm always
[1:09:16] on everybody make sure. So I had I had
[1:09:19] all six of those guys in my office. Now
[1:09:21] guys, I don't want a flaw. I don't want
[1:09:23] to. Amen. And uh uh I wanted to see
[1:09:26] notes and and and Haven says Haven says,
[1:09:30] "Well, I don't have mine on paper." I
[1:09:31] said, "Girl, I don't." She says, "Don't
[1:09:34] you worry. I got this."
[1:09:37] And she had it. Amen. So, but but we so
[1:09:40] we but we're thankful we're thankful for
[1:09:43] the institution
[1:09:45] of of of family. Family is lineage.
[1:09:48] Family is is Amen. is a household with
[1:09:51] dependence there. Amen. It's a father. I
[1:09:55] I I like this interpretation of family.
[1:09:58] Amen. Family is a dwelling created by
[1:10:01] marriage between a male and a female who
[1:10:04] become parents or adopt children
[1:10:07] committed to a parental care and
[1:10:09] nurturing of the same to reproduce
[1:10:11] themselves in character, value,
[1:10:15] conviction through love, discipline, and
[1:10:17] example. I I thought that that was a
[1:10:20] very keen, very accurate uh uh analogy.
[1:10:26] Can you say amen? Now as we as we look
[1:10:30] honor, amen, uh is the word honor is is
[1:10:36] means great respect,
[1:10:39] high esteem, a person or thing that
[1:10:43] brings credit to. Amen. Now, as we read
[1:10:48] this these uh the the the fifth
[1:10:51] commandment there, thou shalt honor thy
[1:10:54] father and mother, I want to put it in
[1:10:55] perspective. The first four
[1:10:57] commandments, the man was honor God. The
[1:11:01] first four commandments, thou shalt have
[1:11:03] no other gods before me. Number two,
[1:11:05] thou shalt not bow to any graven images.
[1:11:09] Number three, thou shalt not take the
[1:11:11] Lord's name in vain. Number four, thou
[1:11:14] shalt keep the holy Sabbath, the Sabbath
[1:11:17] holy unto the Lord. Those were the first
[1:11:20] four commandments, and it had to do with
[1:11:23] our heavenly father. Amen. This is our
[1:11:26] heavenly father. We came Adam came from
[1:11:30] God. We were created in the image of
[1:11:33] God. Amen. God's God's God's uh uh
[1:11:37] requirement or God's blessings and God's
[1:11:40] commission to Adam was was to reproduce
[1:11:45] on the earth.
[1:11:47] Reproduce. Reproduce what? To reproduce
[1:11:51] more gods.
[1:11:53] Amen. That was his commission. I want
[1:11:55] you to take dominion and authority over
[1:11:57] the earth. And I want you to replenish
[1:11:59] the earth with more of you.
[1:12:04] Adam was the son of God. Look, look
[1:12:06] there. Look, look, look there in in in
[1:12:09] the book of Matthew. And if it doesn't
[1:12:11] say all the way down when it gets down
[1:12:13] to Adam and Adam the son of God. So God
[1:12:18] was the father. He was the very first
[1:12:21] father. And God is requiring honor from
[1:12:26] his children. Thou shalt honor the Lord
[1:12:29] thy he and he's going to put it on. He's
[1:12:31] going to put a lot of honor on him.
[1:12:33] Honor the Lord thy God. Don't have no
[1:12:35] images before him. Amen. Sanctify
[1:12:39] his name and a and keep a day that is
[1:12:42] holy to him. But when it but right after
[1:12:44] those first four those first four that
[1:12:46] are dealing with with God then it comes
[1:12:50] and says thou shalt honor thy father and
[1:12:54] thy mother.
[1:12:56] So the first dealing when it's coming to
[1:13:00] to the the natural responsibility
[1:13:04] in society is the very first thing
[1:13:07] before he dealt with thou shalt not
[1:13:09] kill, thou shalt not commit adultery.
[1:13:11] Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not
[1:13:13] bear false witness. Thou shalt not cover
[1:13:15] thy neighbor's house, his his ass, his
[1:13:17] donkey, his his his his wife, his
[1:13:19] servant with that. Amen. He he goes down
[1:13:21] through the list that thou shalt not
[1:13:22] coveret. But before he does any of that,
[1:13:25] he says, you shall honor thy father. All
[1:13:28] right.
[1:13:32] If you honor God
[1:13:35] and there is an honor in the home for
[1:13:39] the father,
[1:13:41] then these other parts of society will
[1:13:44] take care of itself.
[1:13:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:50] Because when there is taught honor, I
[1:13:53] think there's a lot of that there's
[1:13:55] there there's there's there there's been
[1:13:57] too much that that has been uh uh uh put
[1:14:01] on everything else. And there's not
[1:14:03] enough there's not enough honor to the
[1:14:06] the the father. And and and and I I
[1:14:10] understand you women are a lot prettier
[1:14:14] than us guys. and and you're lot you
[1:14:17] have a lot more finesse than us guys.
[1:14:21] And and we're thankful. Amen. We're
[1:14:23] thankful because if I was married to
[1:14:25] somebody else as ugly as me. Hallelujah.
[1:14:28] But I I my wife has skipped out on me
[1:14:31] during my sermon here. Amen. Uh but but
[1:14:34] I'm thankful for my wife. Amen. I I I I
[1:14:38] am thankful. and and uh but but I I want
[1:14:40] you to know that it was Adam that was
[1:14:44] created first.
[1:14:47] Well, praise the Lord. It seems like we
[1:14:49] just can't do these thing the without
[1:14:50] going back to Adam. I think we got to go
[1:14:52] back to Adam was created first.
[1:14:56] Adam was already in full swing of things
[1:14:59] before Eve ever got here. Adam was
[1:15:02] already given the dominion. Amen. And
[1:15:04] the authority before Eve ever got here.
[1:15:06] Can you say amen? Amen. And and and and
[1:15:09] he was to he was to subdue. But you see,
[1:15:13] Amen. And and and but when when God
[1:15:16] wanted to to uh uh give him a help me,
[1:15:21] Adam, God pulled, he reached down inside
[1:15:25] of the man and he pulled out a woman.
[1:15:33] Father, any kind of any any any kind of
[1:15:38] Amen. witness in the house, any kind of
[1:15:42] stability in the house, any kind of of
[1:15:45] of of nurturing in the house starts with
[1:15:50] the father.
[1:15:53] The first the woman came out.
[1:15:55] Hallelujah. The first womb was when a
[1:15:58] father
[1:16:00] The woman came out of
[1:16:05] Hallelujah.
[1:16:07] The woman, the man gave birth to a
[1:16:11] woman. Hallelujah. Now, don't don't
[1:16:13] don't think too deeply. God brought a
[1:16:18] portion of the man to create. Are y'all
[1:16:22] hearing me, mamas? There needs to be a
[1:16:27] respect and an honor for that man in
[1:16:32] your life beyond his ability to work,
[1:16:36] beyond his ability to supply your wants,
[1:16:40] beyond his anything. There should be a
[1:16:45] honor in the fact that man was the very
[1:16:50] first that started it all.
[1:16:55] Can you say amen?
[1:16:57] Amen. Now, when God God seen Amen. he
[1:17:01] pul he pulled another had them out and
[1:17:03] done a done a few adjustments and Amen.
[1:17:07] and and and and gave this other being a
[1:17:11] a a womb and called her woman and Amen.
[1:17:14] she would she would carry the fetus and
[1:17:17] and would feed it and Amen. And and so
[1:17:20] she she we we call her the female today.
[1:17:24] Amen. And and I and I want to just say
[1:17:26] this here today. Amen. I've said it a
[1:17:28] time or two, but I if uh if there's any
[1:17:31] of the Mr. Limp wrist around and and
[1:17:34] you're in the building here this
[1:17:35] morning, Amen. You know, all all I can
[1:17:38] all I can say is Amen. Uh you had better
[1:17:41] have a womb. Amen. for that's the only
[1:17:45] female. That's the only kind of lip
[1:17:47] wrist we need to have is because God's
[1:17:49] got a man, God's got a woman. Well, can
[1:17:52] you say amen? So, so we we've got to
[1:17:55] understand and never forget the
[1:17:58] beginning or the origins come from the
[1:18:02] man. Let's let's look here in in the in
[1:18:04] in 1 Corinthians 11:7. And sisters, I
[1:18:08] want you to really understand this now.
[1:18:10] man was the source from which the woman
[1:18:14] came.
[1:18:18] Now I know that theology can't preach
[1:18:20] today because we've been taught so many
[1:18:24] other things but I am saying our society
[1:18:30] our society
[1:18:32] has gone to hell.
[1:18:36] our society's gone to hell is because
[1:18:40] men have been looked at and they're not
[1:18:44] honored for who they are. I don't care
[1:18:46] what kind of problem your man has.
[1:18:53] If he's a man,
[1:18:55] he deserves honor.
[1:18:58] I'll honor him when No, you honor him
[1:19:01] because he was born
[1:19:04] a male.
[1:19:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:12] Well, let's just see what the Apostle
[1:19:13] Paul says about there in first
[1:19:16] Corinthians 11:7.
[1:19:18] For a man indeed ought not to cover his
[1:19:21] head, for as much as he is the image and
[1:19:24] glory of God. For the glory for the
[1:19:26] woman is the glory of the man. For the
[1:19:28] man is not of the woman, but the woman
[1:19:32] of the man. Neither was the man created
[1:19:36] for the woman, but the woman created for
[1:19:41] the man.
[1:19:43] So if we're going to honor, we got to
[1:19:46] get back to the very beginning. Whether
[1:19:49] I agree, whether I disagree, whether I
[1:19:52] God says, "Thou shalt have no other god
[1:19:56] before me,
[1:19:58] thou shalt put no other images and bow
[1:20:01] to any other. Thou shalt not use the
[1:20:04] Lord's name in vain. You should honor
[1:20:07] him because he is the source of it all.
[1:20:12] He started it all." Yes, sir. Amen. All
[1:20:16] right.
[1:20:18] And men
[1:20:20] when man is the head of the family, they
[1:20:23] start the family. It is the root. Man is
[1:20:26] the root from which the life comes. A
[1:20:29] father, amen, is the foundation. He is
[1:20:33] the the the root to the tree. Praise the
[1:20:36] Lord, Josh. We we just had a we just had
[1:20:39] a tree uh blown over in our yard and
[1:20:41] it's really pretty. It was pretty, you
[1:20:42] know, it had those has those purple or
[1:20:45] those purple and pink flowers that come
[1:20:47] out that grow and it and it's big. Amen.
[1:20:49] But but the and and it was really nice.
[1:20:51] And then the then the these winds come
[1:20:53] through and knocked over our our pretty
[1:20:55] tree. And uh but we look and the root
[1:20:58] system didn't go down very deep at all.
[1:21:00] The root system was just was just barely
[1:21:03] in the ground. So it had a beautiful
[1:21:06] tree. And that's where you kids and
[1:21:08] mamas and houses and lands and and
[1:21:11] whatever comes in. I mean, and every
[1:21:15] everyone looks at the pretty wife and
[1:21:17] the pretty kids and the pretty this that
[1:21:19] and the other. In fact, I remember when
[1:21:20] my boys were little, um the boys, you
[1:21:23] know, they'd go to work with me. You
[1:21:25] boys remember that. They'd go to work
[1:21:26] with me. They they'd work for do their
[1:21:28] schoolwork and then they they they'd
[1:21:30] come out to the job that I was working
[1:21:31] on. And uh my my wife brought him out
[1:21:34] and and and the painter, it was a woman
[1:21:36] that was in there and she was she was
[1:21:39] working. Uh it was a it was a touchup
[1:21:42] finishing up and um um uh so my wife
[1:21:46] comes out with the kids there in Still
[1:21:48] Water and and and and she just this girl
[1:21:52] this this woman that's painting. She's
[1:21:53] just oh my wow. Oh my. So, and uh and so
[1:21:58] she looks and she says, "Your wife is
[1:22:01] gorgeous." Well, thank you. Thank you.
[1:22:04] And uh and she looks there at the boys
[1:22:06] and she says, "Man, these these boys are
[1:22:10] man." And I mean, she's just bragging on
[1:22:13] on my wife and on my kids and and I'm
[1:22:16] just sitting there, you know, all happy
[1:22:18] and thinking, "Yeah, well, you know,
[1:22:20] Amen." And then she turns around and she
[1:22:22] says, "What did you have to do with
[1:22:23] this?"
[1:22:26] Amen. That was it. That was a That was
[1:22:28] That was rough. That was rough. And uh I
[1:22:31] I think she just smelled too many paint
[1:22:33] fumes. But the uh uh she uh but but she
[1:22:38] she had this uh uh uh it she was
[1:22:41] pointing out the tree.
[1:22:44] She was pointing out the fruit.
[1:22:47] She was pointing out Well, praise the
[1:22:49] Lord.
[1:22:51] Amen. But you see the root
[1:22:55] If there wasn't a Wendell Martin, there
[1:22:59] would not be a Jessica Martin.
[1:23:03] If there was not a Jessica Martin, we
[1:23:06] don't believe in the shacking up stuff.
[1:23:08] Jessica Martin entering into Jessica
[1:23:11] Butter. I saved her from the name of
[1:23:13] Butter. Gave her my wonderful name of
[1:23:14] Martin. Amen. I if there was not a
[1:23:18] covenant between me and her where butter
[1:23:22] and Martin comes together, I give her my
[1:23:25] name. I give her children.
[1:23:33] Put that in your pipe and smoke it. You
[1:23:35] lesbian girls that's trying to raise
[1:23:37] families. You ain't got a family. Right.
[1:23:41] A woman will never give another woman a
[1:23:45] family.
[1:23:47] It takes
[1:23:50] m a n and we still do the proper
[1:23:54] pronouns.
[1:23:56] It takes a man.
[1:24:01] Am I doing all right?
[1:24:05] It takes a man to have a family.
[1:24:11] Men aren't the most the the the best
[1:24:13] looking men might you you but but I'm
[1:24:17] and and the and the thing is it's the
[1:24:20] beautiful family, but it's the roots of
[1:24:23] the tree that matters.
[1:24:31] Sometimes we all want to be we want to
[1:24:33] be the head. We take that scripture, the
[1:24:36] man is the head. Us men like like going
[1:24:39] around sometimes uh acting like roosters
[1:24:42] like we're we're the head. But the head
[1:24:44] simply means the foundation.
[1:24:49] Us men are the foundation.
[1:24:53] We're we're the
[1:24:57] beginning. Amen. We we we've got that
[1:25:01] foundation. And sometimes you men might
[1:25:03] think, "Well, I don't have a
[1:25:04] personality." You don't have to have a
[1:25:06] personality. Hallelujah. You you don't
[1:25:08] you you you you don't have to have a
[1:25:10] good job. You don't have to have
[1:25:11] anything. But what you do have to
[1:25:13] provide is a foundation that is solid
[1:25:16] for your family. Because if there is not
[1:25:18] a foundation that is solid, then listen,
[1:25:21] God chose the man. man. There is only
[1:25:24] one way that there's going to be
[1:25:26] children born into the world, and that
[1:25:27] is for a man to ask a woman to marry
[1:25:29] him, and that woman to accept, to take
[1:25:32] on his name, and to produce his seed.
[1:25:38] Can can you say amen?
[1:25:40] That man is the root. He is the
[1:25:43] beginning. He is the start. He is He is
[1:25:46] the alpha.
[1:25:48] Hallelujah. Now he becomes the
[1:25:52] foundation of that family. Mama, you're
[1:25:57] not the foundation.
[1:25:59] Children, you are not the foundation.
[1:26:02] Daddy is that foundation. Can you say
[1:26:06] amen? Now what why is this important?
[1:26:11] Because in our society,
[1:26:13] the foundation of the family has all has
[1:26:16] been but all destroyed. Right?
[1:26:19] foundation is no longer important to
[1:26:22] people.
[1:26:24] The world is not concerned about a
[1:26:27] foundation. How many we've majority of
[1:26:31] us are all uh in the construction field
[1:26:34] and we all know that there's one reason
[1:26:36] that they will condemn a house, right?
[1:26:38] They'll condemn a house if the
[1:26:40] foundation is bad. government will come
[1:26:42] in. The government will come in and
[1:26:44] condemn your house because if the
[1:26:47] foundation is not solid, the house is
[1:26:51] not safe.
[1:26:53] And we don't have Hallelujah. I've ended
[1:26:55] up down here instead of up there. We
[1:26:57] don't have s we don't have the the
[1:27:01] bedrock society anymore is because the
[1:27:06] the father has been taken out.
[1:27:10] Watch it. You You watch what they're
[1:27:12] trying to do. What What has the liberal
[1:27:14] What has the liberal uh uh uh uhh uh
[1:27:17] people of this generation tried to
[1:27:19] They're trying to remove every hint of
[1:27:22] our of our national fathers.
[1:27:28] Our national fathers, our national
[1:27:31] heroes. Well, we can't have George
[1:27:33] Washington because he had a slave.
[1:27:37] We can't we we can't. And they're slowly
[1:27:39] but surely taking down every statue.
[1:27:43] What are they doing? Removing the honor
[1:27:48] of fathers to this nation. And when you
[1:27:52] lose the respect and honor for your
[1:27:55] roots,
[1:27:58] you're no longer you no you're no longer
[1:28:01] a patriot.
[1:28:05] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:28:08] What I am saying here, if I'm if if I if
[1:28:10] I may, I hope I'm not too scattered.
[1:28:14] You mamas, don't ever look across the
[1:28:17] aisle at somebody else's family and say,
[1:28:20] "Huh, I wish I was we was like them."
[1:28:24] When you start doing that, that's a
[1:28:26] graven image. That's a graven image that
[1:28:29] is setting up before uh that you're
[1:28:32] setting up before your husband. God
[1:28:34] don't want graven images for him. And
[1:28:36] God told us what the honor is. All
[1:28:38] right, I'm going to teach y'all how to
[1:28:40] honor you. I'm going to teach you how to
[1:28:42] honor me as God. And he and he goes
[1:28:44] through there. Thou shalt have no other
[1:28:45] gods. Thou shalt have no other husbands.
[1:28:47] Thou shalt have no graven images. Thou
[1:28:50] shalt not have any other opinions of any
[1:28:52] other families around. Come in between
[1:28:54] you and your husband.
[1:28:56] Thou shalt not bear false witness.
[1:29:00] Don't compare your man. Are y'all
[1:29:03] understanding me? As God receives this
[1:29:06] honor, God is saying there's got to be
[1:29:09] an honor
[1:29:13] for the fathers.
[1:29:16] Now,
[1:29:18] as we as as we look
[1:29:21] at at this, Amen.
[1:29:26] today there there's a decay in the roots
[1:29:29] and then when the little storm comes it
[1:29:31] blows over and and but I I I want us to
[1:29:36] point out amen that it is the roots that
[1:29:39] bear the branches honor to whom honor is
[1:29:42] due and you water it's incredible you
[1:29:46] don't you don't when when my wife is is
[1:29:50] there watering her plants or when we're
[1:29:52] watering a tree you don't go up there
[1:29:53] and water the fruit.
[1:29:56] All right. You don't go up there and
[1:29:58] water
[1:30:00] the leaves. What do you water?
[1:30:05] You water the roots.
[1:30:07] I'm saying we got to show the respect
[1:30:10] and the honor. Get the house back where
[1:30:14] it belongs. Put the honor back in the
[1:30:17] roots where it belongs. Honoring fathers
[1:30:21] is not a once in a day or a one day out
[1:30:25] of the year thing. Honoring your father
[1:30:28] is a state of heart. Honor is a state.
[1:30:32] It's a it's it's it's it's what you are.
[1:30:36] It's it's it's the way you see it. Well,
[1:30:39] can you say amen? Amen. So the virtue of
[1:30:42] honoring is applauding, to give praise,
[1:30:45] to salute, to pay homage to, to give
[1:30:48] credit to, to show appreciation to.
[1:30:52] Well, can you say amen? Why? Because
[1:30:54] that father is the foundation of it all.
[1:31:01] Amen.
[1:31:03] So in plain language,
[1:31:06] the sperm donor
[1:31:09] is the starter of the family, the head
[1:31:12] of the family, the foundation of the
[1:31:15] family. Can you say amen? He's the
[1:31:18] source, the genetic pool. Well, praise
[1:31:21] the Lord.
[1:31:22] Now, Amen. As as we move on,
[1:31:29] Iman, if we I I I want us to I I want
[1:31:33] you to think here as I as I wrote down a
[1:31:34] few things here about since I mentioned
[1:31:37] the national fathers,
[1:31:39] man, because when you when you have
[1:31:42] someone that that like the national
[1:31:44] fathers like our father George
[1:31:46] Washington and and and and some of those
[1:31:48] founding fathers that we had, it it
[1:31:51] creates a national spirit of respect for
[1:31:54] for the authority because we we can come
[1:31:56] in line with that. It it it it it has
[1:31:59] that gives you you a a national spirit
[1:32:02] of heritage and history. It gives you a
[1:32:05] natural a national spirit of legacy and
[1:32:07] lineage. Can you say amen? And so so
[1:32:11] when when we look Amen. Uh uh uh today
[1:32:17] America is is
[1:32:20] you don't find too many people that are
[1:32:22] proud anymore.
[1:32:24] You don't find too many people that are
[1:32:26] is because of the lack of respect. Now I
[1:32:30] think this is interesting. I I I they
[1:32:33] they say in 19 or in 2022
[1:32:39] they fell they fell
[1:32:43] uh 30 30 or 40% short of of bringing in
[1:32:50] uh recruiting into the military. So the
[1:32:53] 23 24 it was it was really bad. All
[1:32:57] right. Looking at the statistics before
[1:33:01] yesterday, I I looked at the statistics,
[1:33:03] they say that we have already surpassed
[1:33:08] last year or the 2024's
[1:33:11] uh enlistment. All right, recruits to
[1:33:14] the military. We are already 20%
[1:33:19] above what they all what what what the
[1:33:23] uh uh uh what the goal is. What is the
[1:33:26] difference? We had one man that could
[1:33:29] not bring respect to our country. We've
[1:33:33] got another man. Whether you agree with
[1:33:35] him or disagree with him, he is
[1:33:38] promoting America. America. America.
[1:33:42] What has it done to our young men?
[1:33:46] Our young men are lining up
[1:33:50] to enroll because it has created
[1:33:53] patriotism.
[1:33:59] Are y'all understanding me?
[1:34:02] I am saying there's got to be pride in
[1:34:06] the family.
[1:34:10] There's got to be an honor. I am glad to
[1:34:14] have my father as my father.
[1:34:20] And when I have my father as my father,
[1:34:24] Amen. I can't I can't just pick out his
[1:34:27] good.
[1:34:29] I got to bear his bad.
[1:34:32] Right.
[1:34:34] He couldn't just pick out his daddy's
[1:34:36] good and then pick on No. No. And the
[1:34:40] sad to say, Amen. And I remember growing
[1:34:44] up and my dad could see nothing but good
[1:34:47] in my gr and my grandfather and he
[1:34:50] promoted my grandfather before us boys.
[1:34:52] I mean, my my granddad was my granddad
[1:34:56] could walk on water. My dad told me
[1:34:58] everything that my grandfather could do
[1:35:01] that his heart, his love. Amen. My dad
[1:35:04] instilled so much into me on our family
[1:35:07] tree by just talking about the good
[1:35:10] things that my grandfather has done. the
[1:35:13] giving nature how that he is. He is he
[1:35:15] he he he gave of himself and and and dad
[1:35:19] had all kinds of stories of bringing of
[1:35:22] of of of grandpa and them living in the
[1:35:25] slums. Amen. Wasn't a rich man at all
[1:35:28] living in the slums. But yet all of the
[1:35:33] fatherless around and all of the broken
[1:35:35] homes around, they all were drawn to
[1:35:40] Wesley Martin.
[1:35:43] So my granddad would come home, Amen,
[1:35:45] from driving the truck or whatever uh uh
[1:35:47] uh job he had at the time. A and he
[1:35:51] would he when he would come home, he was
[1:35:53] not allowed to just go go in there and
[1:35:55] go to bed because he had all the
[1:35:57] neighborhood kids that were over there
[1:35:59] wanting to do some. And so dad uh and
[1:36:02] and my dad was all excited about it.
[1:36:04] Amen. All the other kids were coming
[1:36:06] over and they were going to go play
[1:36:07] baseball. Everyone knew that my
[1:36:09] grandfather was going. Now, that is a
[1:36:12] heritage that my dad placed in me. It It
[1:36:17] was something that he reminded I didn't
[1:36:20] know anything about those things.
[1:36:24] Are y'all understanding?
[1:36:27] We should never be we we should we
[1:36:29] should promote We should be real
[1:36:31] patriots of our homes.
[1:36:36] We should be patriots.
[1:36:38] Mary, you ought to be proud of Kobe.
[1:36:41] Very proud. You kids should be proud of
[1:36:44] the dad. And we heard that through these
[1:36:47] kids. Haven, you have a right to be
[1:36:50] proud. You kids should be proud of
[1:36:54] Michael,
[1:36:56] right?
[1:36:58] I should be proud
[1:37:00] of my father.
[1:37:05] Now
[1:37:07] this is this is an incredible thing
[1:37:11] how that God has so instituted it
[1:37:15] because there are some as brother as
[1:37:16] brother Austin brought in that now his
[1:37:21] dad he he's he's he's not known as dad
[1:37:25] and there's been some of you that do not
[1:37:27] know. So, does that mean that God that
[1:37:30] that you don't have anything to be proud
[1:37:32] of? No. You How many's heard of the old
[1:37:35] of the old wild olive tree that has been
[1:37:37] planted into the new olive tree?
[1:37:41] You say, "Well, now no, no, no, no, no.
[1:37:43] God took the Gentiles and planted them
[1:37:48] all of uh and and uh uh uh what's what
[1:37:52] am I?
[1:37:53] grafted grafted them into the regular to
[1:37:56] to the other olive tree. We are
[1:38:00] receiving the benefits.
[1:38:05] We're receive just Gentiles.
[1:38:08] We were orphans, right? Us Gentiles are

[1:41:52] was going to teach those girls cuz they
[1:41:53] were going to be smart.
[1:41:55] And brother Tarn was right there to make
[1:41:57] sure that she was teaching them to be

[1:42:46] don't those girls don't have no problem
[1:42:48] because they have been brought in. They
[1:42:51] have been brought in and a father has
[1:42:55] solidified
[1:42:56] those in his home. Those are y'all
[1:43:01] understand. So you don't have you don't
[1:43:03] have to have the name. And that's the
[1:43:05] way it is with Austin and Dylan. With
[1:43:07] me, you don't have to have my name. I
[1:43:11] have taken those boys and said, "I love
[1:43:13] them as my very own."
[1:43:17] It was something that I that I have
[1:43:19] given myself to. Amen. And I am and I'm

[1:43:36] are so
[1:43:39] monumental.
[1:43:42] They're big. Now, have I been rambling
[1:43:45] too much or am I making sense here this
[1:43:47] this this morning? The the root system,
[1:43:50] brothers. Let me say this, brothers. We
[1:43:53] need the root.
[1:43:56] And you might feel like you're just
[1:43:57] you're just not you just might not be
[1:44:00] the man. Your family is depending upon
[1:44:04] you.
[1:44:07] your family is is
[1:44:11] your your your
[1:44:14] rock.
[1:44:17] I think it's incredible. I don't know
[1:44:21] just looking up the statistics. Been
[1:44:24] doing a lot of statistics. Uh Sister
[1:44:26] Keys, I appreciate you putting some of
[1:44:28] those statistics up u uh before the the
[1:44:32] service.
[1:44:34] But you look look up women's health. You
[1:44:36] look up women's in just just in society.

[1:44:43] page after page after page. Help for
[1:44:45] children. Page after page after page

[1:45:04] And if you're not careful, you take on
[1:45:07] that you take on that that that that
[1:45:08] that mentality of Messiah society. You
[1:45:13] are important.
[1:45:19] Got it all. Got it all. Women only.
[1:45:23] Well, you say, "Well, yeah, it's because
[1:45:24] men's the one doing all the hurting." I
[1:45:27] beg your pardon.
[1:45:30] It's the women
[1:45:34] and the feminist movement that have
[1:45:37] taken the men out of their position.
[1:45:43] It's it's society that brags that women
[1:45:46] for the first time are outnumbering the
[1:45:48] men in the workplace.
[1:45:56] It's the women, according to the USA
[1:45:58] Today,
[1:46:00] the safest drivers in in the land.
[1:46:04] Women.
[1:46:11] I guarantee I'm a safer driver than my
[1:46:13] wife.
[1:46:24] Amen.
[1:46:26] Amen.
[1:46:30] The love
[1:46:33] the fathers.
[1:46:39] I didn't know if Sister Keys was going
[1:46:41] to have time to put some of those up,
[1:46:42] but I've got I I I I went ahead and
[1:46:45] brought some of them with me as well.
[1:46:50] USA
[1:46:52] leads the world in single parent
[1:46:54] families. Can I have a little more time?
[1:46:59] In fact, according to the Pew Research,
[1:47:02] US, the US is over three times the
[1:47:07] global average
[1:47:11] of single parents.
[1:47:14] single parent home.
[1:47:19] According to the National Center for
[1:47:21] Fathering, nearly 25 million children
[1:47:24] across America live without a father in
[1:47:27] the home. That is one in three children.
[1:47:31] 90% of all homeless or runaway children
[1:47:36] are from fatherless homes.
[1:47:42] 71% of high school dropouts come from
[1:47:47] fatherless homes.
[1:47:52] 70%
[1:47:54] of the youth in state operated
[1:47:56] facilities were from single parent
[1:48:00] homes.
[1:48:03] 82% of all school shootings come from an
[1:48:07] unstable family environment or single
[1:48:10] parent family.
[1:48:13] 63%
[1:48:15] of all teen suicides were in a home
[1:48:19] without a father.
[1:48:24] How many kids live in the USA
[1:48:27] without a biological father?
[1:48:30] As we had just pointed out close to 25
[1:48:33] million one and three.
[1:48:38] That is enough children. That is enough
[1:48:41] children to fill the entire New York
[1:48:44] City
[1:48:48] twice.
[1:48:51] Or that's enough children to fill the
[1:48:54] entire city of Los Angeles
[1:48:59] four times.
[1:49:07] Involved fathers are associated with a
[1:49:10] 75% reduction in teen pregnancies.
[1:49:16] Involved fathers
[1:49:21] have a 80% reduction in the likelihood
[1:49:24] of their children going to jail.
[1:49:29] The children are half as likely
[1:49:31] to experience multiple uh depression
[1:49:34] symptoms
[1:49:36] and are far less to abuse substance as
[1:49:39] an adult.
[1:49:43] Teens with poor relationships with their
[1:49:45] fathers
[1:49:48] are 68%
[1:49:50] more likely to drink, smoke, and use
[1:49:55] drugs.
[1:49:58] Are y'all are Are y'all Are y'all Are
[1:50:01] y'all catching me here?
[1:50:04] Satan doesn't want fathers in the home.
[1:50:08] I want my my my my my goal here today is
[1:50:12] just really exemplify that word honor.
[1:50:17] Honor.
[1:50:19] How do you honor? Well, for you children
[1:50:22] that are in the home and for you mamas
[1:50:23] that live with the with with the
[1:50:25] children's father
[1:50:31] is to never bring witness against your
[1:50:34] husband.
[1:50:38] Your father, your your children's father
[1:50:41] should be honored by every one of you
[1:50:44] mamas.
[1:50:56] There should be such an honor. You
[1:50:59] should never degrade your your your your
[1:51:02] f your your your husband to your
[1:51:04] children.
[1:51:05] You should never degrade your husband
[1:51:09] to your girlfriends,
[1:51:11] your your other you you you you should
[1:51:13] always honor honor your man. It should
[1:51:18] be a practice because the practice comes
[1:51:21] from the heart.
[1:51:23] The man deserves honor whether or not I
[1:51:26] don't care what kind of flaws he has. I
[1:51:29] I I I'm not here I'm not here to pick on
[1:51:31] the flaws. I'm not here to say, well,
[1:51:34] that this this this man's daddy is this
[1:51:37] boy's daddy is has got some catching up
[1:51:40] to do with this boy's daddy. That's not
[1:51:42] We're talking about fathers and we're
[1:51:43] talking about honor.
[1:51:46] We're not we're not doing any comparing
[1:51:47] here with nothing. This is the honor.
[1:51:50] Are y'all are y'all understanding me?
[1:51:54] Sarah
[1:51:56] Sarah respected and honored
[1:52:00] her husband
[1:52:05] to the point of calling him Lord.
[1:52:09] And that was brought into the New
[1:52:10] Testament saying that you sisters
[1:52:14] should have that meek and quiet spirit
[1:52:17] and and showing love and honor
[1:52:21] even as Sarah who called Abraham
[1:52:26] Lord.
[1:52:31] We're not getting into whether or not
[1:52:32] you really call your my wife's called me
[1:52:34] Lord a time or two, but it's been in a
[1:52:36] derogative manner. We're not going to go
[1:52:39] there,
[1:52:45] but let's just let's just look the kind
[1:52:47] of man. Let's just look at the kind of
[1:52:49] man. This was the man that lied about
[1:52:52] his wife to save his own skin.
[1:53:00] This was He was not
[1:53:03] Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] He was not always a good man,
[1:53:11] but she honored him.
[1:53:16] Well,
[1:53:20] I mean, what would you do if your
[1:53:21] husband when he got when he got his when
[1:53:23] he got into a little bit of a tight jam
[1:53:25] and he says, "Hey, baby. Now, listen. I
[1:53:28] love you,
[1:53:30] but I want you to tell George you're my
[1:53:32] sister and not my wife." And she'll go,
[1:53:33] "Huh? What? what's going on here? Just
[1:53:36] do what I'm saying. It'll If you want me
[1:53:38] to live to see another day, if you want
[1:53:42] me around, just just tell them. Next
[1:53:44] thing she knows, it's their ass and she
[1:53:46] says, "Yeah, I'm his sister." And then
[1:53:48] the next thing you know is you've just
[1:53:50] been called right into the guy's house
[1:53:51] and he's fixing to marry you. You're
[1:53:54] thinking, "What a scandal.
[1:53:57] What a Right. That's what Sarah got
[1:54:00] herself into. She got herself into a
[1:54:02] little bit of a pickle because of her
[1:54:03] sorry husband, but she called him
[1:54:08] Lord.
[1:54:12] She honored him for who he the position
[1:54:18] that he held.
[1:54:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:23] Hallelujah. You children, you children,
[1:54:26] you don't you don't go around. You don't
[1:54:28] hold your head. you. It is. It is a
[1:54:32] blessing to have your father. I don't
[1:54:34] care who your father is. I don't care
[1:54:36] who your father is. You are blessed.
[1:54:39] Haven said it so beautifully. He's he
[1:54:42] that each one of you fathers all have
[1:54:44] that same characteristics. You're
[1:54:46] teaching your children that the kingdom
[1:54:49] of God cannot work without people.
[1:54:54] what the church is doing. Your daddies
[1:54:57] are teaching you to be a part of it,
[1:55:00] teaching you to be there. Your daddy
[1:55:03] taught you you was talking about, you
[1:55:05] know, him not going to work on a on a
[1:55:07] Wednesday. That's the way the message
[1:55:09] taught us. We are not going to put
[1:55:11] church before our or put put work before
[1:55:16] our God.
[1:55:18] The prophet told us that. Yeah.
[1:55:23] And if you don't take that same
[1:55:24] conviction, it'll pass on to the next
[1:55:26] generation.
[1:55:28] But you take a man that will work on
[1:55:30] Sundays and Wednesdays, so will his
[1:55:31] children. That's what he has taught
[1:55:35] them. There's no conviction.
[1:55:41] Why?
[1:55:43] If the root is poison,
[1:55:47] so will the tree.
[1:55:50] Daddies, it's essential for you all to
[1:55:55] make sure your roots are connected in
[1:55:59] Christ.
[1:56:02] But at the same time, there's going to
[1:56:04] be things in our lives that us daddies
[1:56:06] can't be too proud of.
[1:56:11] The modern father of us all, how many
[1:56:13] knows who the modern father of us all
[1:56:14] is?
[1:56:18] Amen.
[1:56:20] Well, the modern father of us all would
[1:56:21] be Noah. It was Noah and his family that
[1:56:24] that came across in a boat
[1:56:29] eight people,
[1:56:31] right?
[1:56:32] Amen.
[1:56:34] Noah. And the Bible says God looked at
[1:56:37] Noah and there was not a man any more
[1:56:41] perfect than Noah on the face of the
[1:56:43] earth.
[1:56:45] But it was Noah's children.
[1:56:51] They came up on their daddy drunk
[1:56:56] and naked.
[1:57:00] But the Bible says
[1:57:03] that the sons so respected their father.
[1:57:08] I believe it was the eldest
[1:57:10] that took a blanket. They would not they
[1:57:12] they would not look at him. They took a
[1:57:15] blanket. I'm going to steal this from
[1:57:16] you. Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] Walked backwards
[1:57:24] into the tent and would not look at the
[1:57:28] nakedness of their father
[1:57:31] and put a blanket over him and covered
[1:57:34] the nakedness
[1:57:38] of the most perfect man on the Well,
[1:57:40] there's only eight of them then, but
[1:57:43] But back when there were back when there
[1:57:45] were billions, God says Noah was the
[1:57:47] man,
[1:57:52] right?
[1:57:54] It was what were these children doing?
[1:57:58] They were protecting
[1:58:01] his honor.
[1:58:05] Am I getting my point across?
[1:58:08] Do I need more scripture?
[1:58:10] You can you can go you can go through
[1:58:14] all of these scriptures of of men who
[1:58:18] were less honorable
[1:58:21] but yet they were given honor. Michelle
[1:58:24] didn't see the honor in in David. But
[1:58:28] David was a man after God's own heart.
[1:58:38] So what's your terms?
[1:58:41] Okay, let's just look at David who was a
[1:58:43] man after God's own heart. In other
[1:58:45] words, a man that God says,
[1:58:49] you make my heart Peter patter,
[1:58:54] I am going to make you a promise that
[1:58:57] your seed will rule and reign forever.
[1:59:03] This is not a God that don't know
[1:59:04] tomorrow. This is a God that knows the
[1:59:06] tomorrow, knows the past, knows
[1:59:07] everything. He knows it all. And that
[1:59:09] God who knows it all said, "David,
[1:59:11] you're a man
[1:59:13] right close to my heart."
[1:59:17] Well, praise the Lord. Do we need to go
[1:59:18] around through all the weaknesses? Do we
[1:59:19] need to go through some weaknesses here
[1:59:21] or are we just going to How many
[1:59:22] understands? There's a lot of reasons
[1:59:25] not
[1:59:27] to show the honor.
[1:59:29] I'm not talk I'm telling I'm just
[1:59:31] telling this every one of you this
[1:59:32] morning. Amen. And the musicians can
[1:59:34] come. We need to we let's let's let's
[1:59:36] close down all of our excuses and let's
[1:59:39] give the honor to these men that God has
[1:59:43] placed in our lives
[1:59:48] because love goes o over love covers a
[1:59:51] multitudes of mistakes.
[1:59:54] Love covers well. Can you say amen?
[1:59:58] Amen.
[2:00:00] Guys, have I done all right here this
[2:00:01] morning? Because I'm sure not getting
[2:00:02] much from you women. Amen.
[2:00:11] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:14] I'm thankful.
[2:00:17] I looked there at at at the at the
[2:00:19] blessings that my father
[2:00:23] had and and the and and I and I must say
[2:00:26] that my
[2:00:33] my my dad wasn't always in the in in the
[2:00:36] in the top of who's who
[2:00:39] and and uh
[2:00:43] my dad wasn't known to be the most
[2:00:46] powerful preacher
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:50] My dad wasn't kn My dad was known for
[2:00:52] for for
[2:00:54] a billion things.
[2:00:56] He could play music like nobody's
[2:00:58] business, but yet he always took the
[2:00:59] back seat. He could preach like nobody's
[2:01:02] business, but yet he took the back seat.
[2:01:06] He could My My dad just never He was
[2:01:08] always playing the second fiddle. So
[2:01:10] therefore,
[2:01:16] us children were sort of raised in that
[2:01:19] second fiddle mold, the support mold.
[2:01:23] That's that's that's what dad that's the
[2:01:26] way dad trained us.
[2:01:32] He taught us to carry the load. That you
[2:01:35] don't have to be in the spotlight. The
[2:01:38] spotlight's not important.
[2:01:41] what's important is the kingdom of God
[2:01:43] going forward.
[2:01:46] And so when they wanted when they wanted
[2:01:49] a school and there was no one that would
[2:01:51] that would that would volunteer
[2:01:54] to be the principal of the school, mom
[2:01:56] and dad says,
[2:01:59] "I'll be principal." Dad says, Mom says,
[2:02:01] "I'll I'll help teach."
[2:02:04] Mom taught the taught the young the
[2:02:06] younger class.
[2:02:09] that took the principle
[2:02:13] because there was a need that needed to
[2:02:15] be done. That's part of my legacy.
[2:02:18] If I were to cut out the roots
[2:02:22] and not give honor to him, I'm cutting
[2:02:25] out who I am.
[2:02:29] And I appreciated that in all of you all
[2:02:31] and and and your acknowledgement to to
[2:02:33] the men in y'all's lives. But I also
[2:02:36] appreciate the fact that that
[2:02:41] you all understanding as young men
[2:02:45] the importance of the legacy that has
[2:02:48] been given to you all through to through
[2:02:51] the investment that is placed in your
[2:02:53] lives.
[2:02:57] It's an investment.
[2:03:00] And when you cut off the hand that feeds
[2:03:02] you
[2:03:10] in the Native American culture, whether
[2:03:12] it doesn't matter whether you are, it
[2:03:14] doesn't matter who you are, what you
[2:03:16] are,
[2:03:18] you're an elder,
[2:03:20] you brought life into this world,
[2:03:25] and we honor you.
[2:03:28] I say in the in this culture, in the
[2:03:32] church culture,
[2:03:34] if there's ever a need to honor our
[2:03:38] elders, I told my dad, I I and I tried
[2:03:41] to I don't tell him enough
[2:03:43] that he is my rock.
[2:03:46] That even while he's not while while he
[2:03:48] can't preach, I'm fixing to have him to
[2:03:50] say something here in a minute. But
[2:03:52] whether whether or not he is he is
[2:03:59] up preaching anymore or not.
[2:04:03] He's my foundation.
[2:04:07] [Music]
[2:04:09] Don't go home.
[2:04:15] Better not ever die on me.
[2:04:18] Rapture. Rapture time.
[2:04:24] Brother Merl, when when your dad passed
[2:04:26] away, a part of you died.
[2:04:32] It's who you are.
[2:04:35] He put that investment in you.
[2:04:39] But we're thankful for those things that
[2:04:41] God's placed in us. That's the cycle of
[2:04:43] life. Are are y'all are y'all
[2:04:46] understanding? And I and I and and I
[2:04:47] think as as as as as even those that are
[2:04:51] without fathers biologically,
[2:04:55] the importance of of us understanding.
[2:05:00] I know good and well that I've got an
[2:05:04] investment into the the these young
[2:05:06] people's lives. I know good and well. I
[2:05:11] You say, "Well, is that pride?" No,
[2:05:15] I'm a root.
[2:05:18] I'm an elder.
[2:05:21] I
[2:05:23] have a purpose and that is for these
[2:05:26] young men and women.
[2:05:30] Y'all catching me?
[2:05:33] As a family here, the family of God
[2:05:36] carrying the genetics of God.
[2:05:39] Daddies,
[2:05:41] [Music]
[2:05:43] it's not prideful to know that you're
[2:05:44] important.
[2:05:48] It's not prideful to know that without
[2:05:50] you, your family couldn't survive.
[2:05:53] I don't care what the statistics say.
[2:05:55] And we could go through a bunch of those
[2:05:56] statistics, but I'm glad I'm I'm glad
[2:05:59] Austin brought that out that I that I
[2:06:01] would remind him all the time, you're
[2:06:03] not going to be a statistic.
[2:06:06] You're not going to be a statistic.
[2:06:08] You're not going to be one of those. God
[2:06:11] has given you another privilege. You
[2:06:13] have been grafted into another tree.
[2:06:15] Yeah, you might not have things as easy
[2:06:18] as my boys had at home, but I guarantee
[2:06:20] you this one thing here. You've got a
[2:06:21] support system.
[2:06:24] Can you say amen?
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:36] today. Say, "Happy Father's Day."
[2:06:41] Happy Father's Day to all you men.
[2:06:44] Thank you for investing.
[2:06:46] Thank you for loving
[2:06:49] mamas.
[2:06:51] You're blessed to have
[2:06:54] these men in your life.
[2:06:57] I I'm going to I'm going to just I'm
[2:06:59] going to give the mic to dad for a
[2:07:01] minute.
[2:07:02] Did you have something you wanted to
[2:07:04] say?
[2:07:06] Yeah. I seen him raise his finger.
[2:07:10] Sister Clea,
[2:07:12] if you could pull up Psalms
[2:07:15] 127.
[2:07:17] Then after that, pull up a scripture.
[2:07:20] The wise man put on the rock.
[2:07:24] Except the Lord build the house. This
[2:07:27] word house is actually family.
[2:07:31] Except the Lord build the family and
[2:07:33] labor in vain to build it. Except the
[2:07:36] Lord keep this city the wife waketh but
[2:07:39] in vain. Is that taught in this
[2:07:41] scripture before
[2:07:46] the quality of the city depends on the
[2:07:48] quality of the family. Okay. and turn to
[2:07:54] sleep back up said go next verse
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:04] if you rise up early instead of the
[2:08:07] medicine sorrow so give his beloved
[2:08:11] sleep next verse
[2:08:15] children are inheritance of the lord
[2:08:18] and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
[2:08:23] Okay,
[2:08:25] let's go down the next verse.
[2:08:27] [Music]
[2:08:34] Go to the next verse.
[2:08:37] Happy is the man that had script full of
[2:08:39] them. They shall not be ashamed. They
[2:08:42] shall speak the enemies in the gate. Now
[2:08:45] go the
[2:08:47] wise man.
[2:08:51] I think that's Matthew 7.
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:09:01] Therefore, whosoever heareth, the word
[2:09:04] heareth means understand.
[2:09:07] Understand these sayings of mine do
[2:09:10] them. I like him to a wise man which
[2:09:14] built his house before a rock. Mhm. It
[2:09:18] talks about a foolish man. He also heard
[2:09:22] the sayings of the Lord, but he didn't
[2:09:28] build according to what he understood.
[2:09:32] Yeah. So when the the time come, the
[2:09:36] rains come, floods rose, wise man's
[2:09:40] house stood built on a rock of fish
[2:09:45] man's perish. because he didn't take
[2:09:49] time to build it right. Jesus said, "Fon
[2:09:54] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[2:09:56] the gates of hell should not prevail
[2:09:58] against it." Praise the Lord. Why won't
[2:10:00] the gates of hell fell against it?
[2:10:03] Because the the Lord has his heritage.
[2:10:07] Amen. The children
[2:10:09] that are Hallelujah. stand in the gates
[2:10:14] with the enemy. Amen. Now
[2:10:18] we will face
[2:10:20] a dilemma when this message was powerful
[2:10:24] today
[2:10:25] and
[2:10:27] you
[2:10:29] take in 1 Corinthians 11
[2:10:33] the scripture says at the head of man a
[2:10:37] woman is is the man head of man is
[2:10:40] Christ and Christ is God.
[2:10:45] So it's God said everything in order and
[2:10:50] the church
[2:10:53] has revelation. Revelation. Amen. The
[2:10:56] bride has revelation. Who that is? What
[2:11:00] that means? Yes. And smiths herself
[2:11:04] under her head. Christ.
[2:11:07] And so we said thing going on today.
[2:11:12] Insanity
[2:11:13] means can't discern which way is up,
[2:11:17] which way is down. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:11:22] See? Yeah. Except the Lord build the
[2:11:25] house thing that they were in vain. Said
[2:11:27] he built the family. That word house and
[2:11:32] that the wise man built, foolish man
[2:11:35] built means family. Yeah. So a wise man
[2:11:39] built his family on a solid rock. Amen.
[2:11:43] Revelation who Jesus Christ is who is
[2:11:46] he? That's good. He's the head of the
[2:11:48] church. Yeah. Yeah. See that's why today
[2:11:51] we're
[2:11:53] have the mind of
[2:11:56] mind of Christ. Yes. We're not to and
[2:12:01] fro. I wanted to say a few words to you.
[2:12:06] I was going to try to post
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:10] so you can make more sense of it. That's
[2:12:14] good. Got to help the Lord build the
[2:12:16] family. Amen. And he's built our family.
[2:12:20] Amen. Amen. Wonderful.
[2:12:24] Amen.
[2:12:31] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:46] I love my boys and my daughter,
[2:12:49] but
[2:12:51] my children have shown their mother not
[2:12:55] great respect.
[2:12:57] And there's sometimes I didn't do
[2:12:58] everything right.
[2:13:00] But every decision I made, I made it
[2:13:05] based upon my family how it would affect
[2:13:08] them later on in life. If I made a
[2:13:12] decision out of discouragement, anger,
[2:13:15] frustration, bitterness, you know, those
[2:13:17] negative things,
[2:13:20] then it would carry over into them. So
[2:13:23] instead, I had to make sure every
[2:13:26] decision was based upon Christ, what he
[2:13:30] would do. All right. So my children's
[2:13:33] shown me and his mother great respect. I
[2:13:36] really appreciate them for that.
[2:13:40] Amen. Amen.
[2:13:43] Praise the Lord.
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:13:52] When you have the revelation and you see
[2:13:53] the real true love of your fathers,
[2:14:00] it's pretty easy to respect.
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:05] It wasn't that I
[2:14:07] was blind or that I didn't see any of my
[2:14:10] daddy's mistakes.
[2:14:14] I knew my daddy's heart.
[2:14:16] And I knew my dad loved me more than he
[2:14:20] he loved me more than anything else in
[2:14:22] the world. And I knew he loved God.
[2:14:25] And today
[2:14:27] I I can't hardly remember none of my any
[2:14:30] of my daddy's mistakes. I just
[2:14:38] and I I I
[2:14:42] seen this quote
[2:14:45] and it and it's true. Says, "It's
[2:14:48] amazing." This man
[2:14:51] says, "It's amazing how we want to
[2:14:53] magnify dad's failures
[2:14:56] and forget
[2:14:58] his achievements. Another
[2:15:06] man, Lewis Gigglio said, "God is not the
[2:15:09] reflection of your earthly father.
[2:15:13] He is the perfection of your earthly
[2:15:15] father."
[2:15:17] Daddy's
[2:15:19] [Music]
[2:15:21] teach us
[2:15:23] a lot about God.
[2:15:25] Daddies teach us
[2:15:28] they're pointing us to God.
[2:15:30] Lots of mistakes, lots of failures, but
[2:15:32] they're also telling you
[2:15:35] how to repent, how to come back to God,
[2:15:38] how to accept, how to Y'all
[2:15:40] understanding.
[2:15:42] So
[2:15:46] when you look at daddy and you see his
[2:15:48] love for you, then when you see it, you
[2:15:51] think, "Oh, wow. God God is the
[2:15:54] perfection of of what I see in my
[2:15:57] daddy." Amen.
[2:16:00] Praise the Lord. God bless you this
[2:16:02] morning.
[2:16:04] As we we've got a few things that that
[2:16:08] they're wanting to
[2:16:10] uh Sunday school class has got some
[2:16:12] things for for their daddies and then uh
