[26:21] amen all right let's go ahead and turn
[26:24] to Revelations chapter
[26:26] 2
[26:28] [Music]
[26:42] Revelations chapter 2 and we'll be
[26:44] starting at verse
[26:53] one unto the angel of the Church of
[26:56] Ephesus write the these things saith he
[26:59] that holdeth the Seven Stars in his
[27:01] right hand who walketh in the midst of
[27:03] the seven golden
[27:04] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[27:07] labor and thy patience and how thou cast
[27:10] not bear them which are evil and thou
[27:12] Hast tried them which say they are
[27:13] Apostles and are not and H has found
[27:15] them liars and H has borne and Hast
[27:18] patience and for my name's sake H has
[27:21] labored and Hast not fainted
[27:23] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[27:25] thee because thou Hast left thy first
[27:27] love remember therefore from whence Thou
[27:30] Art fallen and repent and do the first
[27:32] works or else I will come unto thee
[27:35] quickly and will remove thy Candlestick
[27:37] out of his place except thou repent but
[27:40] this thou Hast that thou hatest the
[27:42] Deeds of the nicians which I also hate
[27:46] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[27:47] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[27:50] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[27:52] of the tree of life which is in the
[27:53] midst of the paradise of God you may all
[27:57] have your
[28:02] seats when brother Wendell asked me if I
[28:04] would be willing to take the service
[28:08] tonight he asked if I would feel uh
[28:11] comfortable kind of continuing in the
[28:13] the church age book um and I told him I
[28:17] was willing to try so we'll see what
[28:19] happens um it's the I will be the first
[28:24] one to say I am not brother Wendell and
[28:27] so if wants to come in and clean up
[28:28] after me I am perfectly okay with that
[28:31] but we'll trust that the Lord will will
[28:33] guide us as we continue through
[28:36] it so starting in page
[28:40] 92 um of the the church age book we're
[28:44] still in the Ephesians Church age um
[28:47] we're beginning into the the section
[28:49] that's labeled the seed of of Nic
[28:53] atenism um and brother
[28:55] brandom starts out
[28:58] uh with reminding us or with defining
[29:01] what what is the nicians which I know
[29:04] brother Wendell covered previously but
[29:07] um in the church age book uh here on on
[29:10] page 92 it says what are these nicians
[29:13] the word comes from two Greek words
[29:16] niiko which means to conquer and Leos
[29:19] which means the Ley in plain fact
[29:21] somebody was doing something in that
[29:23] early church which was Conquering the
[29:25] leoty if the leoty were being conquered
[29:28] then it must have been some Authority
[29:31] there that was doing
[29:33] it and we'll drop down just to the to
[29:35] the next paragraph and it says now to
[29:38] get to the real meaning of what we are
[29:40] about to go into I must caution you to
[29:43] to ever keep in mind that religion
[29:46] spiritual matters if you like is
[29:48] composed of two parts that intertwine
[29:51] but are opposite are as opposite as
[29:53] black and white religion and the
[29:56] spiritual world are are made of those
[29:58] two trees which had their roots in Eden
[30:01] both the tree of life and the tree of
[30:03] knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the
[30:05] midst of the garden and no doubt their
[30:07] very branches intertwined each other
[30:10] thus in the Ephesian church is that same
[30:12] Paradox the church is made up of good
[30:15] and bad two Vines make the church they
[30:18] are like the wheat and the tears growing
[30:20] up side by side but one is the true the
[30:24] other is the false now God will speak to
[30:28] each one and he will talk about each one
[30:32] he will call them the church and only
[30:35] the elect will really know which is the
[30:37] true
[30:38] Spirit only the elect will not be
[30:41] deceived Matthew chapter 24 and: 24 for
[30:45] there shall arise false christs and
[30:47] false prophets and shall show great
[30:49] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[30:51] were possible they shall deceive the
[30:53] very elect so way back there in the
[30:55] early Church of very short period after
[30:58] Pentecost the false Vine got to
[31:00] intertwine itself around the True Vine
[31:03] and we find these Deeds of the
[31:05] nicians and that spirit is going to be
[31:07] found fighting the True Vine until it is
[31:10] destroyed by God now have you got
[31:13] it all right now what was the spiritual
[31:16] climate of that church it had left its
[31:18] first love leaving its first love of the
[31:21] word of God was revealed to us as having
[31:23] fallen from its origin which was
[31:26] Pentecost in plain English that means
[31:28] this church was in danger of being taken
[31:30] away from the leading of the Holy Spirit
[31:33] and the control of the spirit this was
[31:36] exactly what took place after Moses LED
[31:38] Israel out of Egypt the way of God was
[31:41] to lead them by The Cloud of fire
[31:43] prophetic utterance Miracles and signs
[31:47] and god-given
[31:48] wonders this was to be accomplished by
[31:50] God selected and God ordained and God
[31:54] equipped and God sent men men with the
[31:58] whole Camp being dominated by a holy
[32:01] ghost move they rebelled and wanted a
[32:03] set of rules and Creeds to go by then
[32:06] they wanted a king then they wanted to
[32:09] be exactly like the world and went into
[32:11] complete apostasy and Oblivion that is
[32:14] exactly how the first church age started
[32:17] and it will get worse and worse until
[32:19] the holy spirit is completely rejected
[32:22] and God Must Destroy the
[32:26] people
[32:29] see how it started out in the early
[32:30] church it was called Deeds then it
[32:32] became a Doctrine it became the standard
[32:35] it became the unbending way it finally
[32:38] took over and God was pushed aside oh it
[32:41] started so small so quietly so
[32:44] inoffensively it looked so good it
[32:47] seemed so sound then it caught a hold
[32:50] and like a python it squeezed out the
[32:52] very breath and killed all the
[32:54] spirituality there was in the church oh
[32:57] that false Vine is subtle it is like an
[33:00] angel of Light until it gets a hold on
[33:02] you now I want to say that I believe in
[33:05] leadership but is not the leadership of
[33:08] men I believe in I believe in the
[33:10] leadership of the Holy Ghost coming
[33:12] through the word I believe also that God
[33:14] has set men in the church men who are
[33:17] gifted by the spirit and they will keep
[33:19] the church in order I believe that I
[33:22] believe also that the church is ruled
[33:23] over by men that God sends to take
[33:25] charge but that rule is by the word so
[33:29] that is not men really ruling but the
[33:32] spirit of God for the word and spirit
[33:35] are
[33:37] one let's turn our Bibles to Ephesians
[33:40] chapter
[33:55] 4 Ephesians chapter
[33:58] 4 and we'll start at verse
[34:05] 11 and he gave some Apostles and some
[34:09] prophets and some evangelists and some
[34:12] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[34:15] of the Saints for the work of the
[34:17] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[34:20] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[34:23] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[34:25] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[34:28] of the stature and of the fullness of
[34:31] Christ that we henceforth be no more
[34:34] children tossed to and fro and carried
[34:36] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[34:38] slide of men and cunning craftiness
[34:40] whereby they L lie in weight to deceive
[34:43] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[34:46] up into him in all things which is the
[34:48] head even Christ from whom the whole
[34:51] body fitly joined together and compacted
[34:54] by that which every joint supplieth
[34:56] according to the effectual working in
[34:58] the measure of every part maketh
[35:01] increase of the body unto the edifying
[35:03] of itself in
[35:07] love so brother brandom as he's laying
[35:10] this out in the Ephesians Church age
[35:11] he's talking about
[35:14] how the Ephesian Church age began to
[35:18] move away from the god selected God
[35:23] ordained God equipped God sent men and
[35:26] began to move towards having men that
[35:29] would be ruling over them that would be
[35:31] taking authority over them where it
[35:33] wasn't supposed to be now brother
[35:35] brandom isn't telling us that we're
[35:36] supposed to go away from having men that
[35:39] are speaking or ministering he says very
[35:42] clearly that he believes in God sent men
[35:45] to the church he believes in holy a holy
[35:48] spirit-led Ministry he still ties it
[35:50] back and still says that I believe in
[35:54] the scripture where it says I send some
[35:56] Apostles I I send some prophets I send
[35:58] some evangelists pastors teachers he's
[36:01] not saying that we're supposed to get
[36:02] away from a Ministry but he's saying
[36:05] there's a difference between a
[36:07] spirit-led Ministry and a ministry
[36:09] that's simply there because they want
[36:11] the power and they want the authority
[36:13] and they want to be the ones that are
[36:15] ruling over and taking charge they don't
[36:18] he's not wanting it to be a Ministry
[36:22] that is there for political reasons a
[36:24] Ministry that is there because they
[36:26] enjoy being in a leadership position
[36:29] they enjoy taking charge they enjoy
[36:31] doing these different things now there's
[36:34] some called ministers that are good at
[36:37] leadership and that's one of the skills
[36:39] God give them there are others that are
[36:41] in Ministry that are not good at
[36:43] leadership right because God didn't put
[36:45] that on them that's right and that's
[36:48] fine what matters is the part that they
[36:50] are God called they are God sent they
[36:52] are God anointed and empowered to
[36:55] deliver the message amen they are the
[36:58] ones that are supposed to come to speak
[37:00] to the people that they are in front of
[37:01] to speak to the congregation that
[37:03] they're before what I'm ministering here
[37:07] is not necessarily what brother Wendell
[37:08] is ministering as he's at brother Isaiah
[37:10] Brooks
[37:11] church maybe he's talking on the church
[37:14] ages maybe he's not but he's ministering
[37:17] to a different congregation and so his
[37:20] call that God has placed on his life is
[37:22] to minister to the people that are there
[37:25] and the Holy Spirit anointing him can
[37:27] then use him to minister to the needs
[37:29] that are in that congregation amen we've
[37:32] seen that even as brother Wendell was
[37:33] beginning to go through the church ages
[37:35] when we would have some of these
[37:37] visiting ministers that have come
[37:38] through that they start hitting on
[37:40] things that brother Wendell was just
[37:41] covering in the church ages and it's not
[37:44] because brother Wendell told him hey
[37:46] preaching on the church ages it's
[37:49] because it's the Holy Spirit going this
[37:51] is what I'm ministering to this
[37:53] congregation this is what I'm
[37:54] ministering to the people that are
[37:56] sitting
[37:58] here this isn't necessarily what needs
[38:00] to be spoken to the church that's over
[38:03] in Tennessee at this
[38:05] moment this isn't necessarily what needs
[38:07] to be spoken to the church at Louisiana
[38:09] at this moment right I'm not saying they
[38:11] should never read the church age
[38:13] book but the ministry is designed to
[38:16] speak to the people in that congregation
[38:19] where they're at in that moment in that
[38:23] place that's one of the reasons that we
[38:25] don't go for the idea of someone telling
[38:28] us hey every church should be listening
[38:30] to this message right now because not
[38:33] every church is in the exact same
[38:35] situation the exact same issues or
[38:39] problems so they don't need to listen to
[38:41] the exact same message at the exact same
[38:43] time God has sent a Ministry and
[38:46] anointed a Ministry to speak to the
[38:49] people that are
[38:52] there that's what God sends and this
[38:54] Spirit of niotis is pulling the other
[38:57] direction to go no man should be
[38:59] deciding and we can instruct everyone at
[39:02] once we can say every church should be
[39:05] preaching on this subject on this
[39:08] day because that's what we've decided
[39:11] should be the topic for this year and
[39:13] then here's what you should preach in
[39:14] May here's what you should preach in
[39:16] June here's what you should preach in
[39:18] July it doesn't matter what your people
[39:21] are facing it doesn't matter what
[39:23] struggles they're going through what
[39:25] matters are we've mapped out for the
[39:27] Year this is what we're
[39:29] ministering and that wasn't the way God
[39:31] intended it God intended to have a
[39:33] Ministry a Shepherd that cared about his
[39:36] flock he cared about whether this sheep
[39:38] had been injured this sheep had been
[39:41] hurt whether this sheep was getting
[39:42] enough nutrition he didn't need to have
[39:45] just a generic message he needed to have
[39:49] something that was tailored to what his
[39:51] flock was
[39:52] facing and he needed to be able to
[39:54] minister to them
[40:01] right continuing on page 93 of the
[40:05] Ephesian Church age right at the very
[40:07] bottom of the page paragraph says but
[40:11] see what was happening back there that
[40:14] false Vine was getting a hold and it was
[40:16] teaching that rulership by man was right
[40:19] it taught that the church had to be
[40:21] governed it taught a control over the
[40:23] people but instead of doing it God's way
[40:26] they simply took Authority and vested
[40:29] all the spiritual power in their own
[40:31] hands and came out with a holy
[40:33] priesthood standing between God and the
[40:35] people they went right back to the old
[40:37] aonic system they became Antichrist for
[40:41] they disposed of his medeor mediatorship
[40:44] and imposed their own God hated that the
[40:49] Ephesians hated that and any True
[40:52] Believer will hate it too we would have
[40:55] to be Stone BL blind not to see the same
[40:57] thing at work All Through the Ages and
[41:00] right now it is the worst of all what it
[41:03] was was organization that separated the
[41:05] people of God God's people are supposed
[41:08] to be one by one Spirit are they all
[41:11] baptized into one body and everyone is
[41:14] to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and
[41:17] everyone is to participate in the
[41:19] worship of God but men wanted the
[41:21] preeminence so they took over control
[41:23] and Bishops became archbishops and with
[41:26] imposing titles they bypassed the word
[41:29] of God and taught their own doctrines
[41:31] they got the people to obey them until
[41:34] the time came that their way of worship
[41:35] did not in any way at all resemble the
[41:38] early days of after
[41:40] Pentecost these Deeds were the beginning
[41:42] of apostolic succession from Apostolic
[41:46] succession it was one easy and quick
[41:48] step to church membership as the means
[41:51] of Saving Grace the word was reduced to
[41:54] a Creed Antichrist Christ by his Spirit
[41:57] was predominating the
[42:02] church now we're going to jump around
[42:04] just a little bit so we're actually
[42:05] going to turn forward in our church age
[42:08] book to page
[42:11] 197 because as we're looking at the
[42:14] nickan
[42:16] spirit this is talked about in multiple
[42:18] Church ages so we're actually jumping
[42:20] into the pergan church age just for a
[42:22] little bit
[42:23] here page
[42:25] 197 it's under the heading of the
[42:27] doctrine of the
[42:35] nicians you will recall that I brought
[42:37] out in the Ephesian age that the word
[42:40] nicotin comes from two Greek words Niko
[42:42] which means to conquer and Leo which
[42:44] means the Ley nikotin means to conquer
[42:46] the Ley now why is this such a terrible
[42:49] thing it is terrible because God has
[42:52] never placed his church in the hands of
[42:53] an elected leadership which movs with
[42:56] political mindedness he has placed his
[42:58] church in the care of God ordained
[43:00] Spirit-filled word- living men who lead
[43:03] the people through feeding them the word
[43:05] amen he has not separated the people
[43:07] into classes so that the masses are led
[43:09] by a holy priesthood it is true that the
[43:12] leadership must be holy but then so must
[43:14] be the whole congregation further there
[43:17] is no place in the word where priests or
[43:19] ministers are such mediate between God
[43:21] and the people nor is there a place
[43:23] where they are separated in their
[43:24] worship of the Lord God wants all to
[43:27] love and serve him together nickan ISM
[43:30] destroys those precepts and instead
[43:32] separates the ministers from the people
[43:35] and makes the leaders overlords instead
[43:37] of servants now this Doctrine actually
[43:40] started as a deed in the first age it
[43:42] appears that the problem lay in two
[43:44] words elders prors and overseers
[43:49] Bishops though scripture shows that
[43:51] there are several Elders in each Church
[43:54] some began ignatious among them to teach
[43:57] that the idea of a bishop was one of
[44:00] preeminence or authority and control
[44:02] over the elders now the truth of the
[44:04] matter is the word Elder signifies who
[44:06] the person is while the word Bishop
[44:09] signifies the office of the same man the
[44:11] Elder is the man Bishop is the office of
[44:14] the man Elder always has and always will
[44:16] refer simply to a man's chronological
[44:19] age in the
[44:21] Lord then we're going to drop down to
[44:25] the next pair
[44:27] paragraph in the Blue Book it'll be at
[44:28] the bottom of page
[44:32] 198 in order to clarify this even more
[44:34] Let Me Explain Nicko ISM in this way you
[44:38] recall that in Revelations 13:3 it says
[44:41] and I saw one of his heads as it were
[44:43] wounded to death and his deadly wound
[44:46] was healed and all the world wondered
[44:48] after the Beast now we know the wounded
[44:51] head was the Pagan Roman Empire that
[44:53] great political world power this head
[44:55] Rose again as the Roman Catholic
[44:57] spiritual Empire now watch this
[44:59] carefully what did political Pagan Rome
[45:02] do that was the basis of her success she
[45:05] divided and conquered that was the seed
[45:08] of Rome divide and conquer her iron
[45:11] teeth tore and devoured whom she tore
[45:13] and devoured could not rise again as
[45:15] when she destroyed Carthage and SED her
[45:17] to salt the same iron seed remained in
[45:20] her when she arose as the false church
[45:23] and her policy has remained the same
[45:26] defied and Conquer that is nickan ISM
[45:31] and God hates
[45:34] it and then we're going to do one more
[45:36] jump here and we're going to jump
[45:37] forward to page 369 we're going to the
[45:41] very back of the book into a resume of
[45:44] the
[45:54] ages
[46:00] I'm sorry we're actually starting at the
[46:02] very bottom of page
[46:07] 369 the third age revealed by the spirit
[46:10] of Prophecy that the worldly Church
[46:12] would adopt nianis as a
[46:15] Doctrine the separation of the clergy
[46:17] from the Ley Grew From the biblical
[46:20] truth of the elders Shepherds of local
[46:22] flocks ruling the flocks by the word to
[46:25] the Deeds of nicians wherein the clergy
[46:28] set themselves in rank one over the
[46:30] other which unscriptural formula then
[46:33] evolved into a priesthood that placed
[46:35] the clergy between man and God giving
[46:38] the clergy certain rights all the while
[46:40] denying the Ley their god-given rights
[46:44] this was
[46:45] usurpation in this age it became a
[46:47] Doctrine it was established in the
[46:49] church as the assured word of God which
[46:52] indeed it was not but the clergy called
[46:54] it the word of God and therefore the
[46:57] doctrine was
[47:02] Antichrist now we're going to flip back
[47:04] into the Ephesian Church
[47:10] age and we're going to go to page
[47:23] 105 Ephesian Church age page
[47:27] 105 now let this be
[47:29] known about halfway down the page a
[47:32] little over halfway now let this be
[47:34] known scripture does not play with words
[47:37] whatever is in the record is there for
[47:39] the anointed eyes to see it is there for
[47:41] a
[47:44] purpose 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16
[47:48] says all scripture is given by
[47:50] inspiration of God and it's profitable
[47:52] for Doctrine for Repro for correction
[47:55] for instruction in righteousness that
[47:57] the man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[48:00] furnished unto all good
[48:03] works every word is given for a reason
[48:08] every word is given for a purpose it's
[48:11] not there just to play it's not there
[48:13] just to toy with it's not there because
[48:15] it sounds good it's given for a purpose
[48:19] and every and all scripture is given by
[48:21] the inspiration of God and is profitable
[48:24] for Doctrine for proof for correction
[48:28] for instruction in righteousness amen so
[48:32] we can't move away from the word the
[48:35] word is where it all comes from nickan
[48:37] ISM pulls you away from the word to
[48:40] instead have a Ministry that is set
[48:42] aside that is set above you as this is
[48:45] who I Look to this is who I Look to for
[48:48] everything there's no need for me to be
[48:50] in the word myself because the ministry
[48:52] will tell me what I need to know the
[48:54] ministry will lay L it all out the
[48:56] ministry will make everything clear to
[49:00] me I don't have to look for my own
[49:02] Revelation I just have to look for what
[49:04] the ministry is going to tell
[49:06] me I don't have to go and study the
[49:09] scriptures myself because the ministry
[49:12] is going to say hey we're going to be
[49:14] spending the next month going through
[49:17] the book of whatever or we're going to
[49:19] take a n week study on the book of
[49:22] whatever take your pick we're going to
[49:24] take a two month study on the book of
[49:27] habach I I have guys that I work with
[49:31] that will talk about how the minister
[49:33] has been on this book of the Bible for
[49:35] this many weeks months whatever because
[49:39] they're doing a deep study in
[49:41] it and I sit there and go that's not a
[49:44] bad thing but surely somebody needed
[49:47] something other than that book within
[49:48] two to three months it's like a one to
[49:51] two week study great three months or two
[49:55] months on the single thing and you're
[49:57] not telling me anybody needed something
[49:59] beyond that outside of that you didn't
[50:02] need to deviate for this Sunday because
[50:04] God really pulled you this direction to
[50:06] minister to this need come on there's
[50:09] something off
[50:12] here the spirit of nicim pulls it to
[50:15] where there's a Ministry that is set up
[50:17] and everything I need comes from the
[50:19] ministry I'm no longer looking at Christ
[50:23] as my resource I'm no longer looking at
[50:25] him for my strength or him for my
[50:27] Revelation I'm looking to the man that's
[50:29] standing behind the pulpit or the man
[50:31] that's up on stage that's everything
[50:33] that I
[50:34] need even when you're not even when
[50:37] you're outside the Catholic system and
[50:39] you're not saying oh no they're not
[50:40] actually a mediator between me and you
[50:42] know I still believe Christ is my
[50:43] mediator but they're still looking at
[50:46] that Minister as a
[50:48] mediator whether they call him that or
[50:51] not that's what they're looking to him
[50:53] for that's what they're placing him as
[50:55] as he's the one who can get a hold of
[50:58] God he's the one who can reach out to
[51:02] it and how easy is it even for us in the
[51:06] message ranks to start to go these are
[51:08] some of my these are my favorite
[51:09] ministers man they can really get a hold
[51:11] of the Lord I I really feel most
[51:13] comfortable to go up for prayer if this
[51:16] brother's here come on I really feel
[51:20] most comfortable to go up with my need
[51:24] and ask them to pray for for me or ask
[51:26] them to anoint me with oil because I
[51:29] know God hears their prayer come on
[51:34] okay well do you believe the minister
[51:36] that's preaching that you don't like as
[51:38] much is still Spirit-filled is still God
[51:41] called God
[51:43] anointed then God hears his prayer just
[51:46] as much as your favorite
[51:49] preacher maybe he doesn't have the
[51:52] record behind him of all well-known
[51:54] Miracles that you're holding on
[51:57] to but then we remember wait are the
[52:00] Miracles because of the man or the
[52:03] Miracles because of God
[52:05] come now there are ministers that have a
[52:09] Ministry of healing have a Ministry of
[52:12] Breaking Chains all these different
[52:14] things absolutely I don't argue that in
[52:17] the slightest I'll be the first one to
[52:20] say I enjoy when brother Daryl's here
[52:23] yes sir I enjoy enjoy his ministry and I
[52:27] enjoy the sincerity he has behind his
[52:31] prayer
[52:32] yeah he doesn't have any when he goes to
[52:35] pray for someone you can tell he doesn't
[52:37] have a doubt that God can answer the
[52:38] prayer
[52:40] am but does that mean that some other
[52:42] no-name brother that I've never heard
[52:46] of isn't able to pray for
[52:52] me am I starting to fall into that same
[52:54] place where I'm starting to put more
[52:56] stock in the man than I am God that
[53:02] inspires him that leads
[53:04] him you know if I'm here and the
[53:06] spirit's
[53:08] moving and I'm feeling that pull or that
[53:12] tug that I should go up for prayer and I
[53:16] resist because well you
[53:18] know brother Daryl is going to be here
[53:20] next week I'll just have him I'll go up
[53:21] for prayer when brother Daryl's here or
[53:24] I'll go up when this minister or that
[53:27] Minister even if you're waiting going
[53:29] man I I'm going to wait cuz I want
[53:31] brother Wendell to pray for
[53:34] me if the spirit's moving and pushing
[53:38] you are you really going to argue come
[53:43] or are we allowing that Spirit of nianis
[53:46] that puts man above
[53:48] God to begin to pray on us yeah we all
[53:53] know the story brother brandom talked
[53:54] about of
[53:56] the sister that was out in the audience
[53:58] and she kept feeling a burden to go pray
[54:00] for this
[54:04] baby and finally she she gave into the
[54:07] pressure she went and asked the the
[54:09] mother if she could pray and the mother
[54:13] didn't go oh well brother brandom's
[54:15] going to pray or you know I'm goingon to
[54:18] i'mna I'm going to get in the prayer
[54:19] line she was like oh absolutely honey
[54:22] you can go ahead and pray and I may not
[54:24] be quoting it for but we all know the
[54:27] story and she prays for the baby then
[54:30] she goes up and she's sitting up in the
[54:32] balcony yeah and the mother and the baby
[54:35] get to come through the line and they
[54:37] come up to brother
[54:40] brandom the prophet of the age yeah come
[54:43] on and brother
[54:46] brandom looks at the baby and then
[54:49] begins to tell like oh
[54:51] no this Baby's already healed because
[54:55] because there was this
[54:57] sister it wasn't the favorite Minister
[54:59] come on it wasn't our Prophet come on it
[55:04] was a little sister that felt led by the
[55:08] spirit to go pray
[55:11] amen if God if brother brandom can share
[55:14] that kind of story he's going he's doing
[55:16] his very best to make it clear don't
[55:18] Elevate me don't Elevate the man it's
[55:21] the spirit and if the spirit's leading
[55:25] some no-name Minister that's up here or
[55:28] if the spirit's leading your brother or
[55:30] your sister that's beside
[55:35] you how are you going to sit there and
[55:38] go well I want to
[55:39] wait until this Minister's here or I
[55:43] want to wait until that Minister because
[55:45] that's who I'm comfortable
[55:49] with maybe God's trying to call us out
[55:51] of our comfort zone for a reason or
[55:54] maybe he's just trying trying to remind
[55:56] us that he's
[55:58] Sovereign and that he's the one that
[56:01] does the work that he's the one that
[56:04] will minister to the need that he's the
[56:06] one that performs the healing performs
[56:10] The
[56:12] Miracle yes we love these brothers we
[56:14] love brother Ron Spencer and brother
[56:16] Daryl and brother Donnie and brother Tim
[56:19] and brother pick your pick your name and
[56:23] we love the powerful Ministry that God
[56:25] has Behind these
[56:28] men but if we can
[56:32] believe that the man that's up here is
[56:35] spirit-led and spirit anointed and
[56:39] spirit
[56:41] called then God will respond to that
[56:43] prayer as much as any of the big name
[56:46] ministers that we may have that's right
[56:49] that's but it's so easy for us to fall
[56:51] into that and that is the spirit of
[56:54] nicka to ISM to start putting a man
[56:56] above God going that's who I'm going to
[56:58] respond to that's who I'm going to look
[57:01] towards that's where I'm going to get my
[57:06] Miracle God calls us to look to him for
[57:08] it and to look to his
[57:11] word the word doesn't
[57:13] change whether
[57:16] it's whether it's brother Wendell up
[57:18] here saying by your stripes I'm Healed
[57:21] whether it's me up here saying by your
[57:23] stripes I'm Healed or whether it's some
[57:26] other
[57:28] brother it doesn't change the word it
[57:31] doesn't change the
[57:33] god that said it and the god that will
[57:36] make it come to
[57:48] pass going forward to page to page
[57:53] 106
[57:59] right towards the the bottom of the page
[58:00] we're going to start just a little bit
[58:02] into this
[58:05] paragraph he simply gave the word he
[58:09] said not to partake of knowledge partake
[58:11] of
[58:12] life life was the word of God death was
[58:16] anything that wasn't the word of God she
[58:18] allowed one word to be changed and right
[58:21] then Satan had her God could have said
[58:24] don't pick more fruit off the trees than
[58:26] you can eat Satan could say look that is
[58:29] quite right you see if you pick too much
[58:32] it will
[58:33] rot but here is a method of preserving
[58:35] the fruit and yet at the same time you
[58:38] can pick all you want so you see you can
[58:41] have your way and God's way all at the
[58:44] same
[58:45] time the devil would have her right
[58:48] there he that is guilty in one point of
[58:51] the law has broken the whole law don't
[58:54] fool with that word that is exactly what
[58:57] happened in the Ephesian age before it
[58:59] ran out in about 170
[59:02] ad and what did that tree produce the
[59:05] tree of knowledge produced death Cain
[59:08] killed his brother Abel the wicked
[59:10] killed the righteous it set a pattern it
[59:13] will keep that pattern until the
[59:14] restoration of all things as spoken by
[59:17] the prophets the tree of knowledge
[59:19] produce clever men men of renown but
[59:21] their ways are the ways of death God's
[59:25] people are simple but spiritual minded
[59:27] leaning toward God and nature calmly
[59:30] tilling the soil caring for truth rather
[59:32] than wealth the seed of the serpent has
[59:35] brought tremendous Commerce wonderful
[59:37] inventions but with it all comes death
[59:41] their gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in
[59:43] war and in peace time their mechanical
[59:46] inventions such as the car kill even
[59:48] more in a time of Peace than do the
[59:49] invention of War destroy in times of
[59:51] trouble death and destruction are the
[59:54] fruit fruits of her labors but they are
[59:57] religious they believe in God they are
[1:00:00] like their father the devil and their
[1:00:02] ancestor Cain both of them believed in
[1:00:05] God they go to church they mingle with
[1:00:08] the righteous as do tears mingle with
[1:00:10] the wheat in so doing they corrupt and
[1:00:12] produce a nickan religion they spread
[1:00:15] their poison in every effort to destroy
[1:00:18] the seed of God even as Cain killed Apel
[1:00:21] there is no fear of God before their
[1:00:23] eyes but God loses none of his own he
[1:00:27] keeps them even in death and has
[1:00:29] promised that in the last day he will
[1:00:32] raise them
[1:00:35] up we're called to be
[1:00:37] different God calls us to to live by
[1:00:40] every word eve missed one word but God
[1:00:43] has called a bride that will hold on to
[1:00:46] the word and won't miss anything but
[1:00:48] hold on to every dot every
[1:00:53] tit
[1:00:55] let's turn forward
[1:00:56] to page
[1:00:59] 150 if we're going to be in the saman
[1:01:01] church age for just a
[1:01:13] moment page 115 we're about
[1:01:17] 2/3 2/3 of the way down the
[1:01:19] page second to the last paragraph on on
[1:01:22] page 150
[1:01:26] down through the centuries we could go
[1:01:28] we find a Moses a Jeremiah a John the
[1:01:31] Baptist and each one of these were God's
[1:01:34] Eternal thought expressed in its season
[1:01:37] then we come to Jesus the logos he was
[1:01:40] the perfect and complete thought
[1:01:42] expressed and he became known as the
[1:01:45] word that is what he is and forever will
[1:01:48] be now it says that he hath chosen Us in
[1:01:51] him Jesus before the foundation of the
[1:01:54] world
[1:01:55] that means that we were right there with
[1:01:56] him in the mind and thought of God
[1:01:59] before the foundation of the world that
[1:02:01] gives an eternal quality to the elect
[1:02:04] you can't get away from
[1:02:06] that then we're going to turn forward to
[1:02:08] page
[1:02:13] 152 and we're going to start on the
[1:02:16] second line of the
[1:02:21] page these who are of the royal seed are
[1:02:23] the elect of God are the predestinated
[1:02:26] forn of God and were in the mind of God
[1:02:29] and His Thoughts in very plain language
[1:02:32] the true bride of Christ was in the mind
[1:02:34] of God eternally though not expressed
[1:02:37] until each came forth in the
[1:02:40] designated decreed season as each member
[1:02:44] come forth it became expressed and took
[1:02:46] its place in the body thus this bride is
[1:02:49] the literal spoken word seed bride and
[1:02:53] though she is feminine in design destion
[1:02:54] she is also called the body of Christ it
[1:02:57] is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:02:59] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:03:02] him came from the same Source was
[1:03:04] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:03:07] God in a many membered body whereas once
[1:03:11] God was manifested in a one member even
[1:03:14] our Lord Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ
[1:03:27] now then here we are coming to a
[1:03:30] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[1:03:33] manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[1:03:35] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:03:38] and that Eternal one was the father
[1:03:39] manifest in flesh and thereby gained the
[1:03:42] title of son even so we Eternal in his
[1:03:46] thoughts in our turn became the many
[1:03:48] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[1:03:51] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[1:03:53] manif manest in flesh are the sons of
[1:03:56] God even as we are soall we did not
[1:03:59] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:04:03] and therefore were're reborn for only
[1:04:05] the elect can be reborn because we were
[1:04:08] seed is the reason we could be quickened
[1:04:11] in nonseed there is nothing to
[1:04:17] Quicken 2 Corinthians CH 5 and starting
[1:04:20] at verse 16 says wherefore henceforth
[1:04:23] know we no man after the flesh yay
[1:04:26] though we have known Christ after the
[1:04:28] flesh yet now henceforth know we him no
[1:04:31] more therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:04:33] he is a new creature old things are
[1:04:35] passed away behold all things are become
[1:04:37] new and all things are of God who ha
[1:04:40] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:04:43] and hath given to us the ministry of
[1:04:46] reconciliation to it that God was in
[1:04:48] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:04:51] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:04:53] unto to them and hath committed unto us
[1:04:56] the world the word of
[1:04:58] reconciliation now then we are
[1:05:00] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[1:05:03] beseech You by us we pray you in Christ
[1:05:06] dead be reconciled to God for he hath
[1:05:09] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[1:05:11] sin that we might be made the
[1:05:13] righteousness of God in
[1:05:19] him we're called to be different God
[1:05:22] calls us to live by every word
[1:05:26] when the world wants to go into this
[1:05:28] Spirit of nianis that allows them to
[1:05:31] follow what a man says instead of having
[1:05:35] to abide by the word and spend their
[1:05:37] time in the word to know what it says to
[1:05:39] know what God's telling them to do it's
[1:05:41] they can sit back and simply listen to
[1:05:45] what this Minister says they need to do
[1:05:47] or how they need to live or what they
[1:05:49] need to do but God's calling out a
[1:05:53] special people that are going to be
[1:05:55] ambassadors for him that are going to uh
[1:05:58] live in a way
[1:06:01] and show themselves in a way that is
[1:06:06] different that is going to let them be
[1:06:09] set apart you know when you have an
[1:06:11] ambassador and Ambassador has to be
[1:06:14] selected out of the people it's not just
[1:06:16] any random Joo that they pick to to send
[1:06:19] off it's somebody that has
[1:06:23] certain qualifications that can carry
[1:06:26] themselves in a certain manner that is
[1:06:28] going to be held to a certain
[1:06:30] standard you know they don't want the
[1:06:32] ambassador to go off and then completely
[1:06:35] assimilate with the country they were
[1:06:36] sent
[1:06:38] to they're supposed to still be
[1:06:41] representing who they came from and so
[1:06:44] when Christ says that we are
[1:06:47] ambassadors we are there to represent a
[1:06:51] different Kingdom we are there to
[1:06:52] represent and live in a way that's
[1:06:55] different we're not falling into the
[1:06:57] Trap of well we can just blend in with
[1:06:59] everybody else and we're
[1:07:01] good it's we are supposed to be set
[1:07:03] apart we're supposed to be living by the
[1:07:06] word that God gave us and if you live by
[1:07:09] that word you can't help but be noticed
[1:07:13] that's right right whether it's our
[1:07:15] sisters in the way that they
[1:07:17] dress whether it's the brothers and the
[1:07:19] way that they act on the job site when
[1:07:22] they don't get as upset or as frust
[1:07:23] frustated when they don't start cursing
[1:07:25] about every little thing when they don't
[1:07:27] do this or do
[1:07:30] that people look and go there's
[1:07:32] something different they may not
[1:07:34] necessarily be able to place their
[1:07:35] finger on it they may not necessarily be
[1:07:37] able to identify it completely but
[1:07:39] they're able to look and
[1:07:40] go this is not like everybody else this
[1:07:44] does not blend in this stands out
[1:07:48] there's something
[1:07:50] different and people may not know in
[1:07:53] that moment wow that's an ambassador of
[1:07:55] Christ right
[1:07:56] there but yet at the same time they're
[1:07:59] able to recognize there's something
[1:08:01] different because you're living by the
[1:08:04] word you're living by the instruction
[1:08:06] manual that you've been given to go this
[1:08:08] is how you carry yourself this is how
[1:08:12] you handle different
[1:08:13] situations how in the world can they be
[1:08:16] so calm and have so much peace when this
[1:08:19] is going wrong and that is going wrong
[1:08:21] and they lost their house lost their job
[1:08:23] lost lost their dad lost their mom lost
[1:08:25] their take your pick of what you could
[1:08:27] have lost you probably lost it
[1:08:29] all and yet
[1:08:32] somehow there's a peace somehow there's
[1:08:35] a calmness somehow people are looking at
[1:08:37] you going why aren't you freaking out
[1:08:39] right now yeah why aren't you pitching a
[1:08:42] fit why aren't
[1:08:44] you going through the route that job's
[1:08:48] wife told him why don't you just Curse
[1:08:50] God and
[1:08:51] die yeah and yet instead
[1:08:54] you're continuing to praise him you're
[1:08:56] continuing to thank him you're Contin
[1:08:58] to be grateful for what's
[1:09:05] left because God calls us to be a
[1:09:08] different
[1:09:10] people and God redeemed
[1:09:12] us because we were there at the
[1:09:17] beginning because we were that seed at
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:21] beginning and so
[1:09:24] it's the only way we could be
[1:09:26] redeemed otherwise we wouldn't be
[1:09:28] brought back to be brought back means
[1:09:31] you were there at some point and then
[1:09:34] left and then came
[1:09:37] back so when we're
[1:09:40] being brought back and
[1:09:42] redeemed it's telling us we were there
[1:09:45] at the
[1:09:46] beginning there's a seed that's inside
[1:09:49] us there's a seed that sets us apart and
[1:09:51] that seed is the seed word which is why
[1:09:55] we can't get away from the word which is
[1:09:57] why we keep going back to it which
[1:10:01] is why you can't be
[1:10:04] deceived it's why the scripture says
[1:10:06] that it would deceive the very elect if
[1:10:11] it were
[1:10:12] possible if that word wasn't inside you
[1:10:15] you could be
[1:10:16] deceived if that seed wasn't planted on
[1:10:19] the inside you could miss it you could
[1:10:23] mistake it
[1:10:25] but that seed on the inside that word on
[1:10:28] the inside is what holds you to go I
[1:10:31] can't miss this because it's the word
[1:10:34] here responding to the word I see in
[1:10:36] front of me it's the word here
[1:10:38] responding to the word that's coming
[1:10:40] over the pulpit it's the word that's
[1:10:42] inside responding to the word that comes
[1:10:44] out every time I press press play every
[1:10:47] time I open up my Bible every time I
[1:10:49] open up a message
[1:10:51] book it's the two responding each each
[1:10:53] other going that's where I came
[1:10:57] from that's what was at the
[1:11:00] beginning I'm not interested in just
[1:11:03] sitting under a man and following what
[1:11:05] he tells me to do I'm not interested in
[1:11:08] just sitting and going okay great we're
[1:11:10] going to study this for four months
[1:11:12] we're going to do this for four months
[1:11:14] oh great that's the message I should
[1:11:16] listen to
[1:11:19] today we've had the same thing begin to
[1:11:21] creep in
[1:11:22] here
[1:11:25] hey just
[1:11:27] because maybe this message would be good
[1:11:29] for me to listen to
[1:11:31] today God might have it where brother
[1:11:33] Michael this is the message for you
[1:11:35] today brother Harry needs what's in that
[1:11:37] one brother Michael needs what's in that
[1:11:39] one brother Colby needs what's in that
[1:11:42] one and brother Ken needs this one over
[1:11:48] here because we're all at different
[1:11:51] stages of the J Journey we're all in
[1:11:53] different places in our
[1:11:55] walk you know maybe this was a message
[1:11:58] that I've listened to over and over and
[1:12:00] over but today is the day that I'm
[1:12:02] called to get something special out of
[1:12:05] it today is the day that God's like I'm
[1:12:07] going to give you a little extra nugget
[1:12:09] out of it that you've never seen before
[1:12:11] that you've never caught before and it's
[1:12:14] not for brother Merl to get that nugget
[1:12:16] today he's got a different nugget I've
[1:12:18] got for
[1:12:19] him he's got a nugget over there or
[1:12:22] maybe he already got that nugget so he
[1:12:24] doesn't need to hear it again he's
[1:12:26] already got that one it's in his
[1:12:27] possession so he's moved on to the next
[1:12:29] thing I'm still getting this one back
[1:12:31] here cuz I didn't get it
[1:12:33] yet we're all trying to get the complete
[1:12:36] set we need all the
[1:12:39] nuggets and I missed that one so I have
[1:12:41] to go back to that all
[1:12:44] right well brother Dylan he already got
[1:12:46] that one so he's going forward and he's
[1:12:48] picking up this one over
[1:12:51] here now that's not to say that we can't
[1:12:54] listen to the same message the same day
[1:12:55] and maybe we'll grab the same
[1:12:59] thing but it also doesn't mean that
[1:13:01] God's not calling us to listen to
[1:13:02] different ones at different times
[1:13:05] because he has something ordained for
[1:13:08] each of us that's right I know we've all
[1:13:10] had it in our walk where we've listened
[1:13:12] to a message multiple times but then
[1:13:15] because of something that you've gone
[1:13:17] through more recently it hits a little
[1:13:19] bit
[1:13:21] different and you see the word just a
[1:13:23] little bit different than you have in
[1:13:24] the
[1:13:26] past and it gets you in a little
[1:13:29] different place and you see just a
[1:13:31] little bit different side of the
[1:13:34] equation you get to see a little bit
[1:13:36] different side of God's personality and
[1:13:39] how he works and I had never seen that
[1:13:42] before I'd never looked at it that
[1:13:45] way I know for me it was different when
[1:13:48] I started having children and I became a
[1:13:49] father suddenly I was seeing things in a
[1:13:51] whole different way
[1:13:54] when I would listen to a message and I
[1:13:56] would be talking about God the
[1:13:59] Father it meant something different
[1:14:02] because now I was in that
[1:14:07] place same thing when you went from
[1:14:09] being a single person to getting married
[1:14:12] suddenly there were certain things that
[1:14:13] stood out a little bit
[1:14:16] differently as you get a little bit
[1:14:18] older and your kids are a little bit
[1:14:20] older there's some things in the message
[1:14:22] and in the scripture that begin to to
[1:14:23] stand out a little bit different because
[1:14:25] they're not babies
[1:14:26] anymore now I'm starting to deal with
[1:14:28] teenagers and I've got to handle things
[1:14:30] a little differently and I've got to be
[1:14:32] able to respond to things a little
[1:14:34] differently than I did when they were
[1:14:35] babies when they're babies you can give
[1:14:37] them a quick spanking and you're on
[1:14:39] you're
[1:14:41] done they get a little older and there
[1:14:43] needs to be a little more talking a
[1:14:45] little more explaining a little more
[1:14:47] showing them the path and showing them
[1:14:49] the
[1:14:50] way for the baby it's you're slapping
[1:14:53] his hand to keep him from burning his
[1:14:54] hand the older one you're going that's
[1:14:57] hot don't touch
[1:14:59] it but I may let you touch it to find
[1:15:01] out how hot it is so you don't do it
[1:15:06] again but you begin to talk through it
[1:15:09] you begin to try to
[1:15:11] explain the fire that's around them and
[1:15:13] the things that could burn them in this
[1:15:16] world where when they're
[1:15:19] little it's just snatch them out of the
[1:15:22] street
[1:15:24] don't let them get
[1:15:27] hit and so the word opens up to us as we
[1:15:30] go through these different things in
[1:15:31] life as we begin to experience different
[1:15:33] things as you experience loss as you
[1:15:36] experience pain some of the scriptures
[1:15:38] that you had read over some of David's
[1:15:41] laments and different things they begin
[1:15:43] to mean something a little bit different
[1:15:45] because now you face some pain now you
[1:15:48] faced some loss you've seen things
[1:15:50] through a different set of eyes and now
[1:15:53] those words stand out in a different way
[1:15:55] than they did when you were a kid
[1:15:57] and
[1:15:59] everything was still pretty
[1:16:03] easy but God calls us to go back to the
[1:16:07] word God calls us to hold on to the
[1:16:11] word the world wants to move away from
[1:16:14] it the world wants to go well you know
[1:16:17] that was what the Bible said but that
[1:16:19] was a book
[1:16:21] from thousands of years ago go things
[1:16:24] have been we have to update and so we
[1:16:27] have this ministry to update to tell us
[1:16:29] what it means
[1:16:32] today instead of trusting
[1:16:34] that a god that is eternal could write a
[1:16:38] word over 2,000 years ago that still
[1:16:42] applies in a modern
[1:16:44] age that still applies to everything
[1:16:48] that we deal with does he call out cell
[1:16:51] phones by name no
[1:16:54] does he need
[1:16:56] to you can still find the same lessons
[1:16:59] that
[1:17:01] apply I know we've heard brother Wendell
[1:17:03] hit on it a few times over the past
[1:17:05] several
[1:17:07] weeks but any of those different things
[1:17:09] like you can still find scriptures that
[1:17:10] apply it may not have the term cell
[1:17:13] phone or
[1:17:15] internet but you can still find the
[1:17:18] lessons that apply to it you can still
[1:17:21] find the same things and the word is
[1:17:23] just as good
[1:17:25] today as it was 2,000 plus years
[1:17:39] ago in the sermon
[1:17:42] adoption brother brandom says now if the
[1:17:44] United States of this Fair land here
[1:17:46] sent me over to Russia as an ambassador
[1:17:48] of this nation to Russia they even if
[1:17:51] they have officially sent me to Russia
[1:17:52] all the power that the United States has
[1:17:55] is behind me my word is just the same as
[1:17:57] in the United States if I have been
[1:18:00] recognized as an ambassador and then if
[1:18:02] God has sent us to be his Ambassador all
[1:18:05] the power that's in heaven all that God
[1:18:07] is all of his angels and all of his
[1:18:09] power stands behind our words if we are
[1:18:11] correctly an ordained sent Messenger to
[1:18:14] the people God has come to honor the
[1:18:17] word for he has so solemnly written that
[1:18:19] whatever you bind on Earth that will I
[1:18:21] bind in heaven whatever you loose on
[1:18:23] Earth that will I loose in heaven and I
[1:18:26] give unto thee the keys to the kingdom
[1:18:29] oh such great promise he's given to the
[1:18:34] church the
[1:18:35] nickan spirit goes and tries to put all
[1:18:38] the authority
[1:18:40] with the ministry all the authority goes
[1:18:43] to the pastor or the bishop or the
[1:18:46] Archbishop or the Cardinal or the pope
[1:18:48] or take your pick of which title that
[1:18:51] denomination uses but all the power all
[1:18:53] the authority goes to
[1:18:56] them but the scriptures
[1:18:59] say you're an ambassador for
[1:19:03] Christ and brother Brandon lays out
[1:19:05] clearly if you are an
[1:19:07] ambassador if you are called and chosen
[1:19:11] for
[1:19:13] him then all the authority of the
[1:19:15] scripture goes with you all the
[1:19:18] authority of the Kingdom that sent you
[1:19:21] is behind you
[1:19:24] that's why brother brandom could share
[1:19:26] the story of a sister praying for a
[1:19:29] baby it didn't have to be a minister it
[1:19:32] didn't have to be the prophet it just
[1:19:35] had to be someone that was willing to be
[1:19:37] led by the spirit to go God wants me to
[1:19:41] pray for this
[1:19:43] one now we know God uses the ministry we
[1:19:46] know God uses that
[1:19:51] office but but that doesn't
[1:19:54] change that there is an authority that
[1:19:56] goes along with each one of
[1:20:00] us as a member of the
[1:20:02] Bride we are the ambassadors whether
[1:20:06] we're called to be up behind a Pulpit or
[1:20:08] not we're still part of that and we
[1:20:11] still have the authority of the word
[1:20:14] behind
[1:20:15] us we're still backed by the kingdom
[1:20:18] that sent us the same as any Ambassador
[1:20:21] that's sent by the United States to some
[1:20:23] foreign
[1:20:25] country we're still backed by it as long
[1:20:28] as we're abiding by the word that sent
[1:20:31] us we don't get to go off on a tangent
[1:20:34] and say whatever we want but if we keep
[1:20:36] repeating the word and keep repeating
[1:20:39] what he said then every bit of authority
[1:20:42] that's in
[1:20:43] here is with
[1:20:46] us the same Authority that's behind any
[1:20:50] of those ministers when they're praying
[1:20:53] is behind any brother or sister here
[1:20:55] that's
[1:20:56] praying that's why you can have these
[1:20:59] mothers at home that pray over their
[1:21:01] kids and the kids get
[1:21:03] well because God's going to respond to
[1:21:06] that same prayer of
[1:21:09] faith whether it's a sister whether it's
[1:21:11] a brother whether it's a minister
[1:21:13] whether it's just a member of the
[1:21:17] congregation if it's the word and Faith
[1:21:19] applying the
[1:21:21] word
[1:21:23] God has to
[1:21:28] respond nicm wants to take the power
[1:21:31] away from the leoty wants to take the
[1:21:34] power away from the congregation and set
[1:21:36] it on these men that have placed
[1:21:38] themselves up
[1:21:42] above but God didn't call that of his
[1:21:47] people he called a people that would be
[1:21:49] able to move in the power of the spirit
[1:21:51] that would move when in inspired by the
[1:21:53] spirit that could move and whether
[1:21:55] you're a minister or not if the spirit
[1:21:58] is leading you to do this then you do
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:03] it and you let God use you in that
[1:22:07] moment whether it's saying a few words
[1:22:09] on the job site whether it's saying a
[1:22:11] few words at the grocery store whether
[1:22:14] it's saying a few words at
[1:22:17] home whether it's praying for someone
[1:22:20] even if it's just you in the prayer
[1:22:22] closet praying for someone because they
[1:22:24] popped in your mind amen God can use
[1:22:27] that prayer because he inspired you in
[1:22:30] that moment to think of this person
[1:22:32] that's right and put them on your mind
[1:22:35] he might not have put that on any
[1:22:37] Minister's
[1:22:38] mind but instead he chose you right to
[1:22:42] go I want you to pray for this brother
[1:22:45] or you to pray for this
[1:22:46] sister and you may not even know what
[1:22:49] situation you're praying for you're like
[1:22:51] I have no clue what struggle they may be
[1:22:54] facing I have no idea what sickness may
[1:22:57] be in their body I have no idea what
[1:22:59] this might
[1:23:01] be but yet for some reason God keeps
[1:23:03] putting this person on my heart which
[1:23:07] makes it my responsibility right and God
[1:23:10] tells me in the scripture that I have
[1:23:13] the authority to apply his
[1:23:19] word the nican spirit wants to take that
[1:23:22] Authority away and give it to
[1:23:25] men and God sits here and goes no this
[1:23:28] is my
[1:23:29] bride yes there's a Ministry that they
[1:23:32] have a role to play and they can have
[1:23:36] gifts in that
[1:23:38] Ministry but I am not taking the
[1:23:40] authority away from My bride and my
[1:23:43] people if I'm leading them and calling
[1:23:45] them to do this the spirit moves in the
[1:23:49] leoty just as much as it does in the the
[1:23:52] ministry because that's his
[1:24:03] bride page 108 in the in the church age
[1:24:10] book we're in the last few paragraphs of
[1:24:13] the Ephesian Church
[1:24:20] age God's intention for his creation man
[1:24:24] is to express his word in Genesis Adam
[1:24:28] was given the word to live by a life
[1:24:31] lived by the word would be the word
[1:24:33] expressed that is true is it not but did
[1:24:36] Adam live by that word no because he was
[1:24:39] to live by every word and he failed to
[1:24:41] take heed to every
[1:24:43] word then there arose Moses what a great
[1:24:47] and mighty man he was yet he also failed
[1:24:50] to live by every word
[1:24:52] and that Prophet the type of the great
[1:24:54] prophet to come failed in Anger to obey
[1:24:57] the word and there was also David the
[1:24:59] great king of Israel a man after God's
[1:25:01] Own Heart he failed by adultery when he
[1:25:04] was tempted but eventually in the
[1:25:06] fullness of time there came one the head
[1:25:09] even Jesus who also must be tempted to
[1:25:12] see if he would live by every word that
[1:25:14] proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:25:17] God then was Satan foiled for he was the
[1:25:20] one who lived by it is written and the
[1:25:23] Masterpiece of God overcame by
[1:25:26] reflecting God's word then was this
[1:25:28] manifested perfect one given to the
[1:25:30] Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the
[1:25:33] perfect sacrifice and on the tree he
[1:25:36] received the wounds unto death that we
[1:25:38] by him and because of him might eat of
[1:25:41] the tree of life and then that life
[1:25:43] freely given would enable us to overcome
[1:25:45] and express the word of
[1:25:48] God and now to these sons of God who by
[1:25:51] him overcame are given the privilege of
[1:25:54] the paradise of God and the constant
[1:25:56] Fellowship of Jesus Christ there will
[1:25:58] never more be any separation from him
[1:26:01] whether he goes his bride will go what
[1:26:04] is his he shares with his beloved on a
[1:26:07] joint air relationship the secret things
[1:26:10] will be revealed the dark things will be
[1:26:12] made plain we shall know as we are known
[1:26:15] and we shall be like him this is the
[1:26:17] heritage of the Overcomer who is
[1:26:19] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[1:26:21] the word of the test Tony to Jesus
[1:26:23] Christ how we long for that day when the
[1:26:26] Crooked roads will all be straightened
[1:26:28] and we will be with him time Without End
[1:26:31] May that day hasten its appearance and
[1:26:34] may we hasten to obey his word and
[1:26:36] thereby prove our worthiness to share
[1:26:38] his
[1:26:39] glory he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:26:42] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:26:44] how tragic it is that this first age did
[1:26:47] not listen to the spirit instead it
[1:26:49] listened to man but thank God in the
[1:26:51] last age there will be a group rise up
[1:26:54] the true Bride of the last day and she
[1:26:56] will listen to the spirit in that day of
[1:26:59] gross Darkness the light will return by
[1:27:01] the pure word and we will return to the
[1:27:03] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[1:27:06] Lord Jesus Christ if the musicians will
[1:27:18] come the seed of nickis started in the
[1:27:21] Ephesian Church age
[1:27:23] and we know has grown to fruition in
[1:27:25] this leodan age where now you see it
[1:27:28] clearly that they want it to be all the
[1:27:31] power goes to the ministry and the men
[1:27:34] that are set above and set apart for
[1:27:36] some
[1:27:37] reason because they
[1:27:40] are better called better qualified
[1:27:43] better whatever you want to call it
[1:27:46] however you want to describe
[1:27:48] it but yet God tells us and the prophet
[1:27:53] tells
[1:27:54] us that the power and authority of the
[1:27:57] word is in the bride because we're
[1:28:00] abiding by the word we're not trying to
[1:28:02] follow some
[1:28:04] man-made Doctrine some man-made idea
[1:28:08] some
[1:28:10] man-made
[1:28:13] whatever the word is in us and is
[1:28:16] calling us back to the word to hold on
[1:28:19] to everything that he has told us
[1:28:23] where man where person after person
[1:28:25] throughout history failed in some way to
[1:28:28] hold on to the
[1:28:30] word God has said that there will be a
[1:28:32] bride in the end time that won't give up
[1:28:34] on the word that won't move away from it
[1:28:38] now that doesn't mean that in our flesh
[1:28:40] we won't still stumble we won't still
[1:28:43] have some sort of problem we're not
[1:28:44] suddenly going to be in perfection in
[1:28:46] this
[1:28:49] body but our very desire everything
[1:28:52] thing that's on the inside is to follow
[1:28:55] exactly what he has called us to what he
[1:28:58] has instructed us to what he has set in
[1:29:01] front of
[1:29:02] us that's our desire that's what we turn
[1:29:05] back to and when we fall when we trip we
[1:29:08] run right back to him Lord forgive me I
[1:29:12] didn't mean
[1:29:15] to you know I didn't want to do that you
[1:29:18] know I didn't want to end up in that
[1:29:20] state because I want to be where you
[1:29:23] want me to be I want to do what pleases
[1:29:28] you and if that what if what pleases you
[1:29:32] is that I'm the one who steps up and
[1:29:36] prays for a brother or sister then Lord
[1:29:38] that's what I want to do Lord if what
[1:29:40] pleases you is
[1:29:42] that I'm going to get up when the noname
[1:29:45] minister is up there because you're
[1:29:46] leading me to go to the altar or to go
[1:29:49] up for prayer then Lord that's what I'm
[1:29:50] going to do I'm not holding on to some
[1:29:52] man-made idea that I has to be at this
[1:29:55] minister or see this person in order to
[1:29:59] get what I'm
[1:30:01] needing I have to follow the leading of
[1:30:04] the
[1:30:05] spirit now the spirit could use a
[1:30:09] bigname minister
[1:30:12] absolutely I'm not in any way putting
[1:30:14] down any
[1:30:16] Ministry but I'm trying to make it so
[1:30:20] clear that it's the spirit of nickis
[1:30:23] that sets men above others that sets men
[1:30:28] apart where God is saying this is my
[1:30:33] bride and my bride has the authority
[1:30:38] amen my bride can apply this
[1:30:43] word and I can use the greatest or I can
[1:30:47] use the
[1:30:49] least because it's still my bride
[1:30:52] and that Authority is still
[1:30:56] there
[1:31:02] Amen brother Colby what can we
[1:31:06] [Music]
