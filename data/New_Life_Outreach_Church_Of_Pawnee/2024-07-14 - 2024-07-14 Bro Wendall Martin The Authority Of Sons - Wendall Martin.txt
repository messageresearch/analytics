TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] l [Music] technology it's advancing faster and taking less time to be widely adopted than ever before launch ai ai is basically an emulation of us they're one very special person to me autonomous driving started AI can give us that answer that we've been seeking all along are we alone each time we create a more powerful technology we create a bigger ever for changing the world artificial intelligence can help us to feed the world population AI is teaching the machine and the Machine becoming smart all out of the realm of sci-fi and magic and now just science [Music] ready we're at the dawn of a new age the age of AI [Music] also science will progress especially in the mechanical world automobiles will continue to get like egg shape finally they will build one that won't need a steering wheel they've got it [Music] now it will be controlled by some some other power now if you'll watch as sure as that achievement was by science if the person will have a spiritual mind and understand it represented a achievement of God's economy with his church amen so they was able to achieve it by scientific research and when it happened on Earth God represented with a achievement by his church for things which are do appear was made of things that does not appear seeall a reflection of it now the har and buggy days was who that was the ending of the Lutheran age see har and buggy days they believed in justification God bringing the church from romanism Catholicism he brought it into its first spiritual achievement that the just shall live by faith that was a horse and buggy days as it come from the to the horse and buggy days the next achievement man had in the way of transportation was uh the automobile and you notice that automobile increases all the time in its uh Power now at the end of the Wesley age brought in by spiritual achievement sanctification which means the church raised from a Justified state to a Sanctified State now I want you to remember this as we go along that the church called church is not the church amen the church is church spiritual amen and then Alone Come Pentecost and as science of the world was able to achieve A A Automobile motor the right brothers that created or made manufactured rather the airplane the Flying Machine was far above the car on the earth because he tuck to the air now the right Brothers through their achievement was able to take signs and pattern something here on Earth to show that there was a great spiritual thing fixing to happen amen I when the right Brothers was able to achieve to get a man's feet off the ground Pentecost fell and Tuck to the air with the spiritual giah with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it tued to the air oh hallah got is s off the ground so he could he can swim around Hallelujah got up in the air oh how far he was above the horse and buy how far he was above the automobile he was up in the air he was knocking and puffing and banging but he was flying see what man achieves on Earth for their made of things which do not appear God was able to achieve something by a spirit filled people who were hungering and thirsting and those that would stay with the word but now something else is happening we got an astronaut now John Glenn was our first astronaut and we find out that that's so far be an airplane airplane can only go as far as his pressure and so forth but this is by an atomic power a greater power that presses him so much higher than an airplane airplane even isn't in it right he's been able to do that all right now we got an astronaut natural age and remember the messenger comes at the end of the former method always we prove that there now we're on the astronaut line hey God has science has been able to prove that there's an astronaut that can go so far till you couldn't see it with your natural eyes and it can go where there's any pressure there or not he can just go on out because in a pressurized tank and he can go up there and sail around and see the world around an astronaut oh my what an age that that is coming yes sir go beyond any natural things at all Sweep come on out what does it represent a spiritual age a spiritual time the word God's going to have spiritual astrona amen they're here right now Hallelujah the Eagles of the air that can go beyond any other sail above everything spiritual astronauts Glory that could take the word of God and prove that he's the same yes a spiritual astronaut oh my glory that makes me feel good May in this age now what a wonderful thing for a spiritual astronaut see what is it what did the natural scientist do has been able to achieve that and God through man who would stay with the Bible and say that he's the same yesterday today and forever and not afraid of the promise regardless what anybody said stay with it amen what is it you're becoming an astronaut that can go so far as Beyond denominational things beyond anything else it's beyond the things of the church and him alone you we're at the dawn of a new age the age of AI we're at the dawn of a new age the age of AI [Music] [Applause] [Music] now if you'll watch as sure as that achievement was by science if the person will have a spiritual mind and understand it represented a achievement of God's economy with his church so they was able to achieve it by scientific research and when it happened on Earth God represented with a achievement by his church or things which are do appear was made of things that does not appear see a reflection of it okay hi my name is Bob um in view of its potential to to be possibly the biggest game changer ever do you have any plans to enter the field of artificial intelligence and in general what are your thoughts on it do you think it's even close to being ready for prime time I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence um if I were guess at what our biggest existential threat is it's probably that um so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some uh regulatory oversight um at the maybe at the national and international level uh just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish um I mean with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon you know you know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he's like yeah he's sure he can control a demon doesn't work out people's science has broke into God's Great laboratory until they're going to destroy themselves God lets always lets wisdom destroy himself God doesn't destroy anything man destroys himself by wisdom as he did at the beginning taking Satan's wisdom and instead of God's word in the Garden of Eden there were two trees one was knowledge and one was life and as long as man eat off the tree of life he had everlasting life the first bite he took from the Tree of knowledge he separated his Fellowship from God and every time he takes a bite yet he destroys himself he bit off gunpowder look what that does he bit off automobile off the tree of knowledge kills more of his comrades than all the wars does there won't be one of them in that City there won't be one car one airplane no it'll be an Al together a different civilization it'll be again a civilization not of knowledge not of science but of innocence and faith and the Living God let us strive to enter into that down then it started right back coming back to the church come back from the feet coming up now it's in a head time head time now notice the light you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you can't see with the ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose that it smells you can't you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was a Pentecostal age but now it's in the eye time the scene now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye is that right the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body no moving motion beyond that everything else is moved see move your feet move your muscles and your legs move everything move your your ears can move your nose your lips and so forth but after your eyes there's nothing moves surely was what was it it was a it a body growing from the feet coming up comes up more important parts of the body from the feet on into the lungs and the Heart on into the head who is the head who is the head Christ that's elligence how the body move by the head amen amen and the government shall be upon what his what is his shoulders his body amen that's where the real true church speaks in his power that's where the apostolic power returns to the church when the government shall be upon his shoulders judgment there's coming a real church I believe trying to do my part to present it have it ready to best I know how to present my part in my age to Christ when he comes notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ John 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen now I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord amen then it is gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose they do only his will heyen I believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still amen then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet now if you'll watch as sure as that achievement was by science if the person will have a spiritual mind and understand if represented a achievement of God's economy with his church am so they was able to achieve it by scientific research and when it happened on Earth God represented with a achievement by his church for things which are do appear was made of things which does not appear hallu the reflection of it [Music] oh oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh

[Music] Revelation that I saw the manifestation of the son of man in my day through a man with the spirit of Elijah and recognizing that he was the seventh Church age Messenger as well then I Knew by
