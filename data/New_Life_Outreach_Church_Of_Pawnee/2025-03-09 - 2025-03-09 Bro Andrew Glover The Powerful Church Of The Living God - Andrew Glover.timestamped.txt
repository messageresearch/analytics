[39:09] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[39:13] from on high amen T ye in the city of

[39:21] from on high in the book of 1 Timothy
[39:24] the 3r chapter 1 Timothy the 3r chapter
[39:28] I want to look there at just one verse
[39:31] in the 15th verse of 1 Timothy Chapter
[39:35] 3 The Bible here says but if I T long
[39:39] that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
[39:42] to behave thyself in the house of God
[39:46] which is the Church of the Living God
[39:50] Amen this is not just a building but
[39:51] it's a church and it's the Church of the
[39:54] Living God I love this the pillar
[39:58] and the ground of the truth the Church
[40:00] of the Living God is the pillar and the
[40:03] ground of the truth we ask Lord this
[40:06] morning to add the blessing to the
[40:07] reading of his word as you can have your
[40:09] seats here this morning if I was to take
[40:11] a a title this morning for just a few
[40:13] moments I want to speak to you on this
[40:16] the powerful Church of the Living God
[40:19] Amen the powerful Church of the Living
[40:21] God I want to read a quote here or two
[40:24] quotations from the prophet of God 1957
[40:27] what does it take to make a Christian
[40:29] Life he says now if the Church of the
[40:32] Living God which is the pillar of the
[40:35] truth isn't that's something the Church
[40:37] of the Living God is the pillar of the
[40:40] truth he said God intended this church
[40:42] to be a powerful Church a glorious
[40:45] Church a church that the whole world
[40:48] could look upon as a bride of Christ
[40:50] well expected and espoused and to live
[40:54] in such an atmosphere and conduct itself
[40:57] in such a way that God would be proud of
[41:00] this church to present it to Christ at
[41:03] the coming of the Lord it should live in
[41:06] that characteristic in the church and it
[41:09] should be living that way amen God
[41:12] intended for his church amen to be a
[41:15] powerful Church to be a glorious church
[41:18] amen to be a church that would actually
[41:21] be the living display of his
[41:24] characteristic enticing Spirits 1955 he
[41:27] says I am positive sure this morning if
[41:30] men and women could only get into the
[41:33] position of where their soul and their
[41:36] thinking and their attitudes would be
[41:38] perfect in the sight of God that would
[41:41] be one of the most powerful churches
[41:43] that ever existed if we could only get
[41:46] our soul our thinking and our attitudes
[41:49] Amen in the perfect sight of God he says
[41:52] that would be one of the most powerful
[41:54] churches amen that ever existed now as
[41:57] you look here in Luke 24 and 49 if I
[41:59] could read just a few translation amen
[42:02] there in the Amplified Bible it says
[42:04] listen carefully I am sending the
[42:06] promise of my father amen the Holy
[42:09] Spirit upon you but you are to remain in
[42:13] the city of Jerusalem until you are
[42:15] clothed amen fully equipped amen with
[42:19] power from on high in the emphatic
[42:21] diaglot it says behold I send forth the
[42:24] promise of my father upon you amen am
[42:27] men but remain you in the city amen till
[42:30] you are invested with power from on high
[42:33] amen so the Holy Ghost is going to dress
[42:36] the church amen but he's also going to
[42:38] invest in the church and what he's
[42:41] investing in the church amen is the
[42:44] power or the dunamis which is where we
[42:46] get the word Dynamite from look at this
[42:48] word power it is strength it is ability
[42:51] amen it is inherent power it is power
[42:54] residing in a thing amen by the virtue
[42:58] of its nature or which a person or a
[43:00] thing amen exerts and puts forth it is
[43:04] the power for performing Miracles amen
[43:06] it is the power of Excellence of Soul it
[43:09] is the power and influence which belongs
[43:12] to riches and wealth it is the power and
[43:14] resources arising from numbers amen it
[43:18] is the power consisting in amen or
[43:21] resting upon armies forces and host now
[43:24] I just have to say Amen what I believe
[43:27] about this powerful Church of the Living
[43:29] God I believe that we are the great Army
[43:32] that Joel saw Amen in the second chapter
[43:35] when he said there would be amen a a
[43:37] tearing down amen but then there would
[43:39] be a restoring back and the Bible said
[43:42] amen that God would restore by his power
[43:45] see what he says is behold I send amen
[43:49] the promise of my father upon you look
[43:51] at this word sin it means to send Amen
[43:54] in to order one amen to go to a place
[43:58] appointed that he might be in a state of
[44:01] liberty amen so the Holy Ghost is coming
[44:04] into the church amen under the direction
[44:07] of almighty God Amen not to bring the
[44:10] church into bondage amen but to bring
[44:13] the church into the Glorious Liberty
[44:16] amen wherewith we might be called the
[44:18] sons of God that's why the Bible said
[44:21] You shall amen receive power when after
[44:25] the Holy Ghost has come upon you listen
[44:27] if we know what the Holy Ghost
[44:30] is then we know what the Holy Ghost is
[44:33] not amen and I'll tell you this the Holy
[44:36] Ghost is the spirit of Jesus Christ in
[44:40] you brother R said the Holy Ghost is the
[44:42] power of God Amen that sent you into the
[44:46] heart as a witness of the spirit you
[44:48] have been born again your life is
[44:50] cleaned up the world is dead all the
[44:53] stink of it amen is like the garlic in
[44:56] Egypt see amen you're far away from it
[44:59] amen you are a new creature in Christ
[45:02] Jesus old things have passed away you
[45:05] become new all together a new creation
[45:09] amen you are born of the spirit you're
[45:12] whole members of your body submissive to
[45:14] his spirit and you are moving in the
[45:17] Holy Ghost and you are not listening to
[45:20] the sound of the world Amen your eyes
[45:23] are on Heavenly things listen the Holy
[45:26] Ghost amen is power from on high listen
[45:30] the Holy Ghost is not power from a
[45:32] bishop it's not power from a pope it's
[45:35] not power from a preacher the Holy Ghost
[45:37] is not a handshake the Holy Ghost is not
[45:40] a letter amen it's the gift of God with
[45:43] power amen from on high Amen to
[45:46] demonstrate to the people that God is
[45:49] not dead amen but he is alive and he is
[45:52] moving and he is breathing he said the
[45:55] holy spirit is an experence erience of
[45:57] being filled and endued with power for
[46:01] service am then so this power is not
[46:03] coming to Puff us up this power is not
[46:06] coming to build up our Ambitions of
[46:08] humanity this power is coming Amen to
[46:12] put us into the service of almighty God
[46:14] why are we here this morning we're not
[46:16] here to see who showed up we're not here
[46:19] to see who can out sing who we are here
[46:22] amen that the power of God might find a
[46:24] right away Amen in our hearts in our
[46:27] lives to manifest himself listen we are
[46:30] not here amen just under a church
[46:32] experience but we have a true experience
[46:36] amen by the true power he said the true
[46:39] word comes to the true prophet and he
[46:42] tells you the true word then you follow
[46:44] that true word and you get a true
[46:47] experience of the word because the word
[46:50] is made flesh in you and you have become
[46:53] God's son and the word of God is
[46:56] revolving right out of God into you
[46:59] because you are his nature his spirit is
[47:03] in you and you'll do the works of God
[47:07] listen friends I believe it I believe
[47:09] the Holy Ghost is more than just a
[47:10] feeling I believe the Holy Ghost is more
[47:13] than just an emotion or just a sensation
[47:15] or just a chill bump amen I believe the
[47:18] Holy Ghost is the person of God Amen
[47:21] that is coming this age Amen to empower
[47:24] people Amen to defeat every devil listen
[47:27] we are not the defeated folks we are not
[47:29] the overcome we are the Overcomers by
[47:32] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[47:35] Our Testimony listen you say well I've
[47:37] been baptized amen but I've not received
[47:39] the Holy Ghost amen God is under
[47:42] obligation Amen to give every believer
[47:45] the Holy
[47:47] Ghost you believe God and say you
[47:49] believe God and haven't receive the holy
[47:51] spirit amen then there's something wrong
[47:54] with your faith see because he's more
[47:56] willing to give it to you amen then you
[47:59] are to receive it amen because God is
[48:02] under obligation Amen to keep his word
[48:06] I'll say this I believe amen that a
[48:09] repentance amen precedes a feeling of
[48:12] power the prophet of God said a man
[48:14] cannot lay in the presence of God a
[48:17] church cannot stay in the presence of
[48:19] God Amen under repentance unless the
[48:22] Holy Spirit comes down and gives an
[48:24] unction and a power amen to start a move
[48:27] of God in there among those people I'll
[48:30] just say this Satan hates amen when a
[48:33] preacher begins to preach on the
[48:35] possibilities after a repentance amen
[48:38] because he knows what can happen when a
[48:41] true repentance takes place do you know
[48:43] there were two men in the Bible amen
[48:46] that were sought to be killed amen it
[48:48] was Apostle John and it was or Apostle
[48:51] Paul rather Amen in John the Baptist do
[48:54] you know why that the devil was trying
[48:56] to kill those men is because they were
[48:58] preaching amen the possibility after a
[49:01] repentance and the devil knew if they
[49:04] repent then that's going to bring God on
[49:06] the scene and what I have held and what
[49:09] I have pounded and what I have Shackled
[49:11] is I'm going to lose my grip listen
[49:13] folks that's why the devil don't want
[49:15] you to repent that's why he don't want
[49:17] you to say I'm sorry or to forgive me
[49:20] amen or ask God to forgive you because
[49:22] he knows the minute that a true
[49:24] repentance amen takes place in the soul
[49:27] of the believer there is a possibility
[49:29] for a Revival there is a possibility for
[49:32] a miracle oh I say Satan you're too late
[49:35] we've already repented we've already
[49:38] repented of our sins we've repented of
[49:40] our iniquities amen we've asked God to
[49:43] forgive us now we're asking God to Endo
[49:45] us with power amen from on high amen for
[49:49] service amen there is a reason why Satan
[49:52] wants to stop a repentance is because my
[49:55] Bible said that God is not a
[49:58] man that he should lie and neither is he
[50:02] the son of man that he should repent he
[50:04] said when you thoroughly repent and
[50:07] believe on the Lord and are baptized in
[50:10] the name of Jesus Christ you make God a
[50:13] liar if you don't receive the Holy
[50:17] Ghost oh my amen if you are thoroughly
[50:21] repented and been baptized in his name
[50:24] and you don't receive the Holy Ghost you
[50:27] have made God a liar but my Bible says
[50:30] God is not a liar and neither is he the
[50:33] son of man that he should repent listen
[50:36] if you have made it right amen you say
[50:38] well I made this mistake and and I done
[50:41] this and I done that let me say this the
[50:43] moment that's underneath the blood amen
[50:46] God don't look at you the same anymore
[50:49] come on sister Bruce amen you're
[50:51] standing there and you don't know if
[50:53] you've had a birth you don't know if
[50:55] you've had an experience and a prophet
[50:57] is looking at you and he says now listen
[50:59] you're saying all these mistakes and all
[51:02] these problems he said but here's the
[51:04] problem amen is I'm not a sinner and
[51:08] neither are you oh church that ought to
[51:10] put make you put your joy shoes on that
[51:13] there is a blood and there is a water
[51:16] and there is a spirit that can change a
[51:18] man and make him a new creature in
[51:20] Christ Jesus listen this power this
[51:23] power I'm talking about this power
[51:26] belongs to God and has been invested
[51:29] into the church David says in Psalm
[51:32] 62:11 he said God has spoken twice amen
[51:36] twice have I heard this that power
[51:38] belongeth unto God in 1 Chronicles 29
[51:41] and12 amen both riches and honor come of
[51:44] thee thou reignest over all and in thy
[51:47] hand is power and might in thy hand is
[51:50] to make great and to give strength unto
[51:53] all 2 Chronicles 258 but if I will go do
[51:57] it amen be strong for the battle amen
[52:01] for God shall make thee fall before the
[52:03] enemy for God ha power to help and he
[52:07] has power to cast down job 26:12 he
[52:10] divideth the sea with his power and by
[52:13] his understanding amen he smiteth though
[52:17] the proud Psalm 65 and6 which by his
[52:20] strength amen he Seth fast the mountains
[52:23] look here being girded with power
[52:27] listen the god that separated the Seas
[52:30] is the god that fastened the mountains
[52:32] he's the god that placed the Stars he's
[52:34] a God that placed the moon amen but that
[52:37] same God has come into your soul amen by
[52:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost what has
[52:43] he done he has come to guard you amen or
[52:46] to inquip you or to clothe you with
[52:48] power it's the father who takes care of
[52:51] it and who's got any more power than
[52:54] God so what kind of power have you got
[52:58] over you to take care of you have you
[53:00] ever wondered about that what kind of
[53:02] power have you got over you to take care
[53:04] of you brother Kobe he says the whole
[53:07] powers that created the universe my
[53:10] goodness amen the powers that created
[53:13] the universe is right here in this
[53:16] building this morning look what he said
[53:18] and pick up your pen and write the
[53:21] members of the Virgin bride will love
[53:23] him they will have his potentials for he
[53:25] is their head and all power belongs to
[53:29] him they are subject to him as the
[53:31] members of our body amen are subject
[53:34] amen now watch this are subject to our
[53:37] heads brother said now remember dear
[53:39] friends amen God's power is not to be
[53:42] made a show but God's power is to be
[53:46] displayed in his characteristic Hebrews
[53:49] chapter 1 verse one amen I'm trying to
[53:51] lay a foundation y'all's preaching me
[53:53] amen God who at sunnd times and divers
[53:56] man are spake in time pass unto the
[53:58] fathers by the prophets ha in these last
[54:01] days spoken unto us by his son whom
[54:04] Heath appointed heir of All Things by
[54:07] whom also he made the worlds who being
[54:10] in the brightness of his glory the
[54:12] expressed image of his person now watch
[54:15] this and upholding all things amen by
[54:18] the word of his power notice it doesn't
[54:21] say by the power of His word it says by
[54:24] the word of his power when he made him
[54:27] Purge their sin sat down on the right
[54:30] hand of the Majesty on high brother BR
[54:33] picks this up and says the brightness of
[54:35] whose Glory God's glory the expressed
[54:38] image of whose presence God's see the
[54:41] word amen that upholds all things amen
[54:44] science tries to tear it down and say
[54:47] it's an old book it's been translated
[54:49] the Roman Catholic Church Bishop Sheen
[54:51] said it's been translated four or five
[54:54] different times and there's not much to
[54:56] it you couldn't live by it if you had to
[54:58] but he upholds all things by his word
[55:02] amen that's when I think about it I
[55:04] believe the Bible he said the word of
[55:07] his power now watch this there is power
[55:11] in his words he upholds all things by
[55:14] the word of his power amen but there are
[55:17] power in his words come on folks what
[55:19] power is in his words it's not the power
[55:22] of the Catholic pope it's not the power
[55:24] of the Pentecostal Bishop it's the power
[55:27] of the Holy Ghost and that same power is
[55:30] inside of every believer here this
[55:32] morning hey that's why the devil hatte
[55:34] you because no matter how low you go no
[55:37] matter how disappointed you become no
[55:40] matter how depressed the devil tries to
[55:42] depress you there is aware of this power
[55:45] on the inside of your soul and the
[55:47] minute you begin to believe that God is
[55:49] bigger and God is greater and God is
[55:52] stronger you'll put on your marching
[55:54] shoes like the children of Israel and
[55:56] you'll March around the walls of Jericho
[55:59] because the word of his power will bring
[56:02] the walls
[56:03] down yes sir tear the word down if you
[56:06] want to but it's already in the flesh of
[56:09] the
[56:11] Bride Glory what is it it's a Divine
[56:14] support Church we're not here by our own
[56:16] power we're not here by our own ability
[56:19] we are divinely supported by the power
[56:23] of Christ listen you're not a halfway
[56:27] equipped Church you are a fully equipped
[56:30] church can I remind you of something God
[56:33] don't call the
[56:35] equipped but he equips the called the
[56:39] prophet of God said so you stay there
[56:41] until God Eclipse you with the baptism
[56:43] of the spirit then everything you've got
[56:46] need of in this world or the world to
[56:49] come amen lives right in
[56:53] you woo brother so the god that that
[56:56] wrote the word is also the investor of
[56:59] the Divine revealer of that word in
[57:03] other words you are invested with power
[57:07] from on high in the in the reach 1963 he
[57:10] said tomorrow night by the grace of God
[57:12] we're going to try amen to break that
[57:15] first seal if God will break it for us
[57:18] and let us see what this Revelation has
[57:21] been hid from the foundation of the
[57:24] world so here a Prophet is going to
[57:27] Endeavor Amen to open the seals amen
[57:31] which is the word of God and by the
[57:33] opening of Seven Seals is going to
[57:36] reveal the mysteries of the Bible and
[57:38] it's going to bring a power into the
[57:41] church let me just show you something
[57:43] this is separating Amen brother Kobe
[57:46] it's separating a Pentecostal Revival
[57:48] from the brides's
[57:50] Revival Pentecost was getting their
[57:52] Revival from the music they were getting
[57:54] their Revival from the preachers they
[57:56] were getting a Revival from
[57:57] personalities but when the word begin to
[58:00] be open amen the word of his power begin
[58:04] to be revealed into the Flesh of the
[58:06] church that's why the devil can't stop
[58:08] you he can stop our music he can stop
[58:11] our singing he can control our feelings
[58:14] but he cannot stop this word he said
[58:16] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[58:19] word amen shall never fail come on New
[58:22] Life Outreach this church has been here
[58:24] for years you've been through battles
[58:26] and wars and troubles and and issues and
[58:29] unbelief and people come and people
[58:31] going but you're still here and you're
[58:34] still standing because this is not a
[58:36] fleshly Revival it's not a musical
[58:39] Revival it is the word of this power
[58:42] Revival it is the revelation of Seven
[58:45] Seals it is the Thundering of seven
[58:47] Thunders it is the breaking of the bread
[58:49] of life and it has become your
[58:52] support my goodness before we do that

[1:02:09] universe brother said regardless of the
[1:02:11] difference he said there's only two
[1:02:13] Powers there's only two kingdoms listen
[1:02:16] there's God's power and there's Satan's
[1:02:18] power he said every war every disorder
[1:02:22] everything that comes along is either
[1:02:24] controlled by God's power or Satan's
[1:02:27] power see there is the power of life and
[1:02:30] there is the power of death he said now
[1:02:33] Satan his power that he's got is the
[1:02:37] perverted power of God the devil's power
[1:02:40] is the perverted power of God he said
[1:02:44] listen it isn't no real power it's only
[1:02:47] a perversion of God's power amen today
[1:02:51] sitting here you're either controlled by
[1:02:53] the power of God or you're controlled by
[1:02:56] the power of the devil and the devil's
[1:02:58] power is a perverted power but God
[1:03:02] promised in the last days that he would
[1:03:04] restore to the Church of the Living God
[1:03:07] the original Power he said I will
[1:03:10] restore sayith the Lord listen I'll send
[1:03:12] back another church glory to God I will
[1:03:16] send back another church in the last

[1:03:26] light what are you saying I'm saying
[1:03:28] folks the original Power is the real
[1:03:32] power he said there's been much mockery
[1:03:35] in every phase of religion but there is
[1:03:37] a real power of the holy spirit that
[1:03:40] delivers the human being from bondage of
[1:03:42] sin there's a real power of the holy
[1:03:45] spirit that delivers the sufferer from
[1:03:48] his suffering amen can you preach with
[1:03:50] me say these words the holy ghost is
[1:03:53] real well say it again the Holy Ghost
[1:03:55] ghost is real there is a real Holy Ghost
[1:04:00] he said I'm so sick and tired of human
[1:04:01] philosophy I want to see the real power
[1:04:04] of God Amen demonstrate and moving among
[1:04:08] his people where that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:10] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:04:14] he's proving himself listen that's what
[1:04:18] the world is hungering for the world is
[1:04:21] not hungering for fanaticism now I know
[1:04:23] when you start preaching about power and
[1:04:25] the move of God there's always that
[1:04:27] little scarecrow it says well there's
[1:04:29] always the danger of fanaticism and
[1:04:32] there's always the danger of wild fire
[1:04:34] let me just say this if you ain't got no
[1:04:36] fire at all you ain't got to worry about
[1:04:40] Wildfire I find it amazing brother Josh
[1:04:43] most of the people that's always getting
[1:04:45] on me about fire turning into Wildfire
[1:04:47] wouldn't know fire if they met it in a
[1:04:49] three acre field they ain't got no fire
[1:04:51] to worry about turning into Wildfire
[1:04:53] listen folks fanaticism only makes the
[1:04:56] real power of God shine brighter what is
[1:04:59] the real power amen the real power of
[1:05:02] the resurrected Christ amen is the real
[1:05:05] Pentecostal blessing the Pentecostal
[1:05:07] blessing amen is not you shouting and
[1:05:10] dancing the real Pentecostal blessing is
[1:05:13] the confirmation of the Resurrection
[1:05:16] that the Jesus that died is the Jesus
[1:05:18] that rose again and he's not in a tomb
[1:05:21] in Jeffersonville he's not in a grave in
[1:05:24] Jerusalem but he's right here this
[1:05:26] morning and he is robed in the flesh of
[1:05:29] his wife by the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:32] Ghost yes sir the world has the wrong
[1:05:36] understanding of
[1:05:37] power listen what a prophet says he says
[1:05:40] how could Satan throw amen how could
[1:05:43] Satan say that man could be God he's
[1:05:46] talking about Jesus hanging on the cross
[1:05:48] he says a man that could take the
[1:05:50] challenge of a priest and let a drunken
[1:05:52] Soldier spit in his face now come on
[1:05:55] Church
[1:05:56] he he he raised the dead brother he
[1:05:59] opened blinded eyes brother Merl he
[1:06:02] walked on the water he bid Peter to come
[1:06:05] walking to him and Peter walked as long
[1:06:08] as he kept his eyes on Jesus but the
[1:06:11] very second he took his eyes off of
[1:06:13] Jesus he be to sink and Jesus reached
[1:06:16] down his eternal hand and picked him up
[1:06:18] out of the water amen I'm talking about
[1:06:20] a man that fed 5,000 with just two fish
[1:06:23] and five loaves of bread I'm talk
[1:06:25] talking about a man that they ran out of
[1:06:27] wine at a wedding and he turned the
[1:06:29] water into wine but yet he could hang
[1:06:32] there on the cross and let a priest
[1:06:34] challenge him and let a drunken Soldier
[1:06:37] spit in his face he said church today
[1:06:40] we've got the wrong conception of
[1:06:44] power wouldn't power be amen challenging
[1:06:47] the priest back wouldn't power be amen
[1:06:50] amen correcting or zapping the life out
[1:06:53] of the soldier amen that spit in his
[1:06:55] face no here's what he says he said
[1:06:58] power is
[1:06:59] overcoming so power is overcoming he
[1:07:03] says it's returning good for evil that's
[1:07:06] the real power woo now we're going to
[1:07:09] preach aren't we the real power is not
[1:07:11] the power to speak squirrels into
[1:07:14] existence although we believe in that
[1:07:16] the real Display of Power is not the
[1:07:19] ability to walk on water the real
[1:07:21] Display of Power is not the ability to
[1:07:23] speak in tongues or Shout amen but the
[1:07:26] real display of the real power is the
[1:07:28] ability to overcome by returning good
[1:07:32] for evil that you can love your enemy
[1:07:35] and do good to those that do evil to you
[1:07:38] that's the real power that's God's power
[1:07:42] he said Maniacs can break chains but it
[1:07:44] takes a real man to return good for evil
[1:07:48] now watch this from his heart amen not
[1:07:52] because of a religious duty but from his
[1:07:55] heart now who are we talking about we're
[1:07:58] talking about Jesus Christ who hung upon
[1:08:01] the cross here's what he says in Luke
[1:08:04] 23:34 then said Jesus now here he is
[1:08:07] amen he's hanging on the cross they spit
[1:08:09] in his face the priest has challenged
[1:08:12] him amen they've driven a sword into his
[1:08:15] side there's a crown of thorns upon his
[1:08:17] head his butt his back is nothing but a
[1:08:20] bloody banket come on folks amen he's
[1:08:23] not looking like anything that is of any
[1:08:25] value or any of any worth but oh if they
[1:08:28] could only see who was hanging upon that
[1:08:31] cross it was more than a man it was the
[1:08:34] power of God on display in the flesh of
[1:08:39] Jesus he stands there and he cries these
[1:08:41] words brother Duran he says
[1:08:46] father get even with
[1:08:49] them Father give him a piece of your
[1:08:52] kingdom and let him know what it's like
[1:08:54] to be smitten he screams out these words
[1:08:57] father forgive them for they know not
[1:09:00] what they
[1:09:01] do look here and they parted his
[1:09:05] reignment and they cast lots now come on

[1:09:11] studying on this and the Lord asked to
[1:09:12] give it to me amen who are we talking
[1:09:14] about here we're talking about the head
[1:09:16] of the church we're talking about the
[1:09:19] head of the Church of the Living God
[1:09:22] which is none other than our Lord Jesus
[1:09:24] Christ and the prophet said and pick up
[1:09:26] your pen and ride he said as the members
[1:09:29] of the body are subject to the head here
[1:09:32] is our head and he's displaying the real
[1:09:35] power of God In The Darkest Hour of his
[1:09:39] life let me say this the same power that
[1:09:42] manifested in the head is going to
[1:09:45] manifest in the
[1:09:47] body that's why the devil hates us is
[1:09:51] cuz we're not good at holding grudges

[1:13:37] radio message around the
[1:13:39] world five times I believe it was of
[1:13:43] power coming off of that dying woman
[1:13:47] church I hope you see how powerful you
[1:13:50] are watch here go on beyond the moon the
[1:13:54] stars to the the Throne of God with that
[1:13:56] prayer to a sinner's poor heart in the
[1:14:00] hours of her death now watch this
[1:14:02] Infidel or this scientist brother
[1:14:05] brother Josh he leaves this Christian
[1:14:07] and goes over to this Infidel and he
[1:14:10] hooks the same meter upon this Infidel
[1:14:13] and he says now let's see what his reads
[1:14:16] he says now he was laying there dying
[1:14:18] with the veneral disease they sent a
[1:14:20] young lady in there to get him all
[1:14:22] emotionally worked up and then when he
[1:14:24] got angry with her he began to curse and
[1:14:26] take God's name in vain and the meter
[1:14:29] turned back as far as the other way as
[1:14:32] the Christian did this way so the
[1:14:35] Christian meter brother Caleb it went so
[1:14:37] far in the positive that you could send
[1:14:40] a radio message around the world five
[1:14:42] times but when it come to this Infidel
[1:14:45] and they hooked it up to him it sent it
[1:14:47] so far in the negative that it wouldn't
[1:14:49] even
[1:14:51] rais and the scientist now watch this
[1:14:54] and it's as far as he knows me the other
[1:14:56] way now can I just show you something

[1:15:01] guy that just keeps reading and reading

[1:15:04] then Jesus hung there on the cross and
[1:15:07] whatever character he was displaying
[1:15:09] while he was hanging on the cross
[1:15:12] whatever character he was displaying was
[1:15:14] so powerful that it even influenced the
[1:15:17] Roman soldiers around him it was so
[1:15:19] powerful that they had to acknowledge
[1:15:22] this is more than a man up there he was
[1:15:24] so powerful are you with me he was so
[1:15:27] powerful that even in his death there
[1:15:30] were two thieves that were hanging on
[1:15:32] each side of him and one of them
[1:15:34] accepted him oh God woo Glory brother

[1:26:48] and so lived this way for years and
[1:26:50] years and years I read a story the other
[1:26:51] day a very powerful story I don't know
[1:26:53] it was just a powerful story I'll share
[1:26:54] it with you there was a man who didn't
[1:26:56] send his wife to work on the 911 day
[1:26:59] some of you may have read it he didn't
[1:27:00] send his wife to work on 911 the tower
[1:27:03] that she would have been in was the
[1:27:05] tower that would have been crushed she
[1:27:06] would have died when he called when his
[1:27:09] father called his father said Son oh God
[1:27:13] his father said son he said is your wife
[1:27:15] at work he said no Dad she stayed home
[1:27:18] he said praise the Lord he said I got to
[1:27:20] go down there and do what I can to help
[1:27:22] free them people that man went in them
[1:27:24] Towers trying to deliver people you know
[1:27:27] what the story says the story says that
[1:27:29] his son thought dad oh no he can't do
[1:27:32] this what if he dies he's not saved what
[1:27:35] if he don't know Jesus he's not saved
[1:27:38] you can't go in there The Story Goes
[1:27:40] years later there was a young man that
[1:27:42] found him and said are you so and so he
[1:27:45] said yes he said I got to tell you a
[1:27:47] story he said your your father was in
[1:27:50] that Rubble trying to deliver my mom he
[1:27:53] said and they realized they were trapped
[1:27:55] and they weren't going to get out of
[1:27:56] that Tower he said and when they
[1:27:58] realized they were going to die he
[1:28:00] screamed out I'm not even saved and he
[1:28:02] said I've got a record that as your dad
[1:28:05] was trying to deliver my mom died she
[1:28:07] witnessed to him about Jesus Christ and
[1:28:10] he accepted Jesus Christ I say it's time
[1:28:14] to take the limits off of God he can do
[1:28:17] anything anywhere anytime under any
[1:28:21] conditions because he's God Miguel he's
[1:28:23] God god brother Kobe he's God on the
[1:28:26] mountain he's God in the valley brother

[1:28:31] he's God when we
[1:28:33] don't he's the unlimited
[1:28:38] God it's time to take the restrictions
[1:28:42] off of
[1:28:43] him an unlimited God has sent to you an
[1:28:47] unlimited message to reveal an unlimited
[1:28:49] power which has produced an unlimited
[1:28:53] Revival
[1:28:56] well I'm just going to say it Satan you
[1:28:58] tried to kill the Revival this church
[1:29:01] and you
[1:29:04] failed Satan you tried but you
[1:29:09] failed Satan you tried but you failed
[1:29:13] because the unlimited God is in this
[1:29:16] church and he has an infinite number of
[1:29:21] solutions woo brother
[1:29:25] brother conquering that makes me want to
[1:29:27] shout the unlimited
[1:29:30] God an unlimited
[1:29:34] number what are you saying when we go
[1:29:36] beyond our own sound barrier into the
[1:29:38] word of God then it's unlimited what God
[1:29:40] can do with a man when you catch a
[1:29:43] vision of the unlimited power brother
[1:29:46] said what the church is lacking today is
[1:29:48] testifying of our great and powerful
[1:29:51] Jesus today
[1:29:54] we try to limit him and say well he was
[1:29:58] back Yonder but today he's the same that
[1:30:03] he was then and the church who's got the
[1:30:06] vision of this and knows it all not to
[1:30:08] be slack at any time but telling
[1:30:11] everywhere they
[1:30:14] go Jesus
[1:30:16] lives and Jesus
[1:30:19] Reigns and he's above all
[1:30:24] folks I'm sorry there's only two types
[1:30:28] of churches in the universe today
[1:30:30] brother said Jesus in his church today
[1:30:32] would be just as powerless as your faith
[1:30:35] is and just as powerful as your faith is
[1:30:38] you say what kind of churches are there
[1:30:40] there are powerless
[1:30:41] churches and there are powerful churches
[1:30:45] what's powerless without ability without
[1:30:47] influence or power what's powerful
[1:30:49] having great power strength in Matthew
[1:30:52] 13 the parable of the so in the seed I'm
[1:30:54] running out of time remember said look
[1:30:56] he said you're always pointing how
[1:30:58] Wicked the world's getting but you fail
[1:31:00] to see how powerful the church is
[1:31:02] getting at the same time she's rising up
[1:31:06] standing on the field oh she's little Fu
[1:31:09] but brother God's with her and she's
[1:31:11] going to Triumph just as certain as
[1:31:13] Christ rose from the dead can I say what
[1:31:15] a prophet said I I come to minister to
[1:31:18] your new life Outreach can I say what he
[1:31:20] said will you accept it how many members
[1:31:23] of the church here will accept it he
[1:31:25] said the church is going to Triumph
[1:31:28] through the blood of Jesus Christ to the
[1:31:32] victory
[1:31:33] march I say devil get out of our way I
[1:31:37] done got my marching shoes on I'm
[1:31:40] underneath the blood I've got a
[1:31:42] prophet's word I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:31:45] the word of his power has been invested
[1:31:47] in my soul devil I may look like a
[1:31:50] failure now but you're going to have to
[1:31:52] take a sideline and watch me
[1:31:54] March woo we're always complaining about
[1:31:58] the world and how Wicked the world is
[1:32:00] but you forget to realize how more
[1:32:03] powerful the church is than it used to
[1:32:07] be when the world is getting wickeder
[1:32:10] and wickeder and wickeder y'all believe
[1:32:12] a
[1:32:13] prophet the church is getting more
[1:32:17] powerful and Powerful all the time when
[1:32:20] the enemy comes in like a flood come on
[1:32:25] the spirit of God will
[1:32:28] raise a
[1:32:30] standard I'm feeling good
[1:32:33] folks we know that this is a separating
[1:32:36] time when the world will continue to
[1:32:38] grow worse but the church will become
[1:32:41] more concerned and your spirit will get
[1:32:45] greater and more powerful all the time
[1:32:48] in the church until Christ and the
[1:32:52] church unites together you say brother
[1:32:55] Andrew this is a this is a perilous time
[1:32:57] the spirit of Prophecy did say perilous
[1:32:59] time shall come you know what he said he
[1:33:02] said they'll deny the power of God he
[1:33:04] said I'll stand at the door and I'll
[1:33:05] knock If any man will open I'll come in
[1:33:08] and sck with him and he with me but said
[1:33:10] his word testifies in the last day there
[1:33:13] will come a falling away and the world
[1:33:16] would come up a cold formal powerless
[1:33:18] Church
[1:33:21] age did I read that right a cold
[1:33:25] formal powerless Church
[1:33:29] age but not bright
[1:33:34] age going to be a powerless Church age
[1:33:37] but there's a bride called
[1:33:39] out Glory he said the Book of Revelation
[1:33:42] shows that Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:33:45] into the church and would defile it
[1:33:47] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:33:50] and a Prophet come along and said God
[1:33:53] hates a powerless religion and any
[1:33:56] religion today that hasn't got Christ in
[1:33:59] it is powerless he said God wants to
[1:34:02] perform his word by his power by the
[1:34:05] Holy Ghost and the church wants to
[1:34:07] perform now watch
[1:34:09] this he said they deny the power and
[1:34:11] they bring in membership no matter what
[1:34:14] you have to baptize Sinners drunkards
[1:34:15] Bootleggers anything else and take them
[1:34:17] in to the body of CH of the church he
[1:34:20] said what they're doing is they are
[1:34:21] denying the power now now can I just
[1:34:24] preach here for a second you say deny of
[1:34:26] the power they're denying the dunamus to
[1:34:30] change the
[1:34:31] nature of the individual brother said
[1:34:35] people join churches and call that God
[1:34:36] salvation he said that's blasphemy he
[1:34:39] said there's a lot of difference between
[1:34:40] the blessings and power he said God
[1:34:42] makes his blessings upon the righteous
[1:34:44] and the unrighteous we got to go back to
[1:34:46] truth friends we got to come back to
[1:34:48] what God means what he says he means God
[1:34:50] wants to perform and bring forth the
[1:34:53] holy Spirit into operation in the church
[1:34:56] and the church wants to perform and
[1:34:58] bring forth its Creeds to make
[1:35:01] members let me let me let me let me say
[1:35:03] this to you but when I speak of this
[1:35:05] powerful Church of the Living God I'm
[1:35:09] speaking of the true church that
[1:35:11] according to scripture was divinely
[1:35:14] instituted by God in Matthew 16:18 Jesus
[1:35:18] says this I say also unto thee Thou Art
[1:35:21] Peter and upon on this rock somebody say
[1:35:26] Upon This
[1:35:27] Rock brother brother Josh what does he
[1:35:30] say I will
[1:35:33] build my
[1:35:37] church brother Miguel I will build my
[1:35:44] church I'm feeling good
[1:35:47] folks can I read the rest of
[1:35:50] it and the gates of hell
[1:35:56] the Gates of Hell shall not brother dur
[1:36:01] that's you better you've been reading it
[1:36:02] for years buddy shall not Prevail
[1:36:04] against it Jesus stands there and is
[1:36:07] making a claim you know what he's saying
[1:36:10] he's saying I will build my church look
[1:36:14] at this word build it means to build up
[1:36:17] from the foundation it means to
[1:36:20] restore by building
[1:36:24] Paul says you are built upon the
[1:36:26] foundation the apostles prophets look
[1:36:28] what he says in whom also the building
[1:36:30] fitly framed together growth un a holy
[1:36:32] Temple of the Lord in whom ye also are
[1:36:35] builded together for a habitation of God
[1:36:39] through the spirit look at this word
[1:36:41] built it means to finish the
[1:36:45] structure of which the foundation has
[1:36:49] already been laid to give constant
[1:36:52] increase in Christian knowledge and in a
[1:36:55] life conform thereto look what Peter
[1:36:58] says in 1 Peter 2:5 ye also as Lively
[1:37:02] stones are built up a spiritual house
[1:37:05] you are a holy priesthood to offer
[1:37:08] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:37:12] by Jesus
[1:37:15] Christ can I just say this and don't get
[1:37:17] mad at me this beautiful building that
[1:37:20] God gave you New Life Outreach is not
[1:37:23] the church
[1:37:25] church it's not the church it's a
[1:37:27] beautiful building but brother kby it's
[1:37:30] not the church can I prove it to you
[1:37:33] y'all remember on the dedication Day
[1:37:35] come in here and the building was
[1:37:36] flooded that didn't stop us from
[1:37:38] worshiping
[1:37:39] God come on Amen y'all remember you come
[1:37:43] in here and move pews around and pack
[1:37:45] music down to the blue building and we
[1:37:47] had Church you know why because this is
[1:37:50] not about a building it's about a people
[1:37:53] who have been established upon the
[1:37:55] foundation of the spiritual Revelation
[1:37:58] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God he
[1:38:02] is the way he is the truth he is the
[1:38:05] life oh I say it to you folks the devil
[1:38:08] had to stand on the sidelines and watch
[1:38:11] this church scramble and go have church
[1:38:13] somewhere else you know why because we
[1:38:16] serve an unlimited God which means he
[1:38:19] has an unlimited number of solutions to
[1:38:23] any
[1:38:29] situation listen to this and I'm closing
[1:38:32] message of Grace message of
[1:38:35] Grace the message of
[1:38:42] Grace the
[1:38:44] message of Grace we know the scripture
[1:38:48] says Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone he
[1:38:50] is also the headstone now if we will
[1:38:53] think for just a few
[1:38:54] minutes that the seventh Church
[1:38:57] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:39:00] the
[1:39:01] children back to the fathers in other
[1:39:05] words he's going to rebuild are you
[1:39:08] ready for this rebuild the church again
[1:39:12] under the power of the
[1:39:16] spirit not by power not by might but by
[1:39:21] my spirit sayeth the Lord
[1:39:24] not by organization not by denomination
[1:39:28] but by the Holy Spirit God will bring
[1:39:32] forth the church in the last days can I
[1:39:36] say this to you the church is not a
[1:39:41] building it's persons who have come in
[1:39:44] contact Direct contact by the holy
[1:39:48] spirit with this unlimited God who is
[1:39:51] named Jesus Christ
[1:39:53] God revealed and you identify that is
[1:39:57] the one of Matthew
[1:39:59] 16 it's a spiritual Revelation that the
[1:40:03] message sent to you is the
[1:40:06] person of Jesus
[1:40:09] Christ God has rebuilt a
[1:40:14] church by
[1:40:18] restoration folks that ought to make you
[1:40:21] raise your hands and say thank you Jesus
[1:40:26] brother Kenny didn't take all the broken
[1:40:28] pieces and just throw it
[1:40:31] away he rebuilt this
[1:40:35] church by the power of restoration I'm
[1:40:39] I'm gonna share this with you and I'm
[1:40:40] done several years ago I was I was

[1:43:01] day I take a few hours and go down there
[1:43:03] and sand and work and cut and glue and

[1:43:30] be thrown away but the difference was
[1:43:33] somebody that had a vision for it come
[1:43:36] by and picked it up and said there's an
[1:43:39] infinite number of solutions I don't
[1:43:41] care how many hours I don't care how
[1:43:43] many days I don't care how many

[1:44:03] rejects in a bunch of boxes behind a
[1:44:05] bunch of churches but God who is rich in
[1:44:08] Mercy sent a seventh angel he said I
[1:44:12] will pick up the broken pieces and I
[1:44:14] will rebuild the church again I'm not
[1:44:17] going to do it under theology I'm not

[1:45:05] church has the pillar of fire the signs
[1:45:08] and wonders still has the same Christ
[1:45:12] which it vindicates all the way from the
[1:45:15] dying lamb in the Garden of Eden until
[1:45:18] the second coming of the Lamb absolutely
[1:45:21] the same yesterday
[1:45:24] today and
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:31] forever can I say something to you this
[1:45:35] morning the characteristic of
[1:45:38] God is Not on display in heaven this

[1:45:53] characteristic of God is Hebrews
[1:45:55] 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:45:58] today and forever how many knows the
[1:46:00] characteristic of God is that he is the
[1:46:03] unchanging
[1:46:04] God which means he never
[1:46:08] changes come on
[1:46:10] folks brother Merl that that's almost

[1:46:42] inside of you and it's
[1:46:46] unchanging and the devil hates
[1:46:48] that brother he hates the fact that the
[1:46:52] stability of God is on
[1:46:56] display in the Church of the Living
[1:47:00] God I've been broken

[1:49:30] I remember when brother brother Sean
[1:49:33] started those tent meetings out there I
[1:49:34] remember we we were sitting there
[1:49:35] talking one day about it I don't you
[1:49:37] you've heard the testimonies and I'm not
[1:49:39] going to go through all but I'm going to
[1:49:40] say

[1:49:44] we don't have a tent and I said well I
[1:49:45] said I know I we I know somebody we can
[1:49:47] get one and had all this lined up and
[1:49:49] then right out the clear blue this this

[1:49:55] so many people and and we're scrambling

[1:50:14] of walking away from the message they
[1:50:16] were done with the message and right
[1:50:18] there in that tent meeting a pastor who
[1:50:21] had a vision to build a plat form to
[1:50:23] preach the message of the hour and not
[1:50:26] personalities just to promote the
[1:50:28] message and Men of God mounted behind
[1:50:30] that pull pit and some of y'all were
[1:50:32] there and stood there service after
[1:50:34] service laying word against that devil
[1:50:36] that was trying to take that family out
[1:50:39] and today that man's preaching this
[1:50:42] message his kids are writing songs about
[1:50:45] this message they're in a solid message

[2:09:55] morning I trust you was

[2:10:00] morning you know I we brought brother
[2:10:03] Benji over yesterday look at the church
[2:10:05] and I was telling him some of the
[2:10:07] testimonies you know and I just I
[2:10:09] started to reflect on it how when we was
[2:10:11] working on the parking lot first of all
[2:10:12] we didn't even have the money for the
[2:10:14] parking lot but God provided the money
[2:10:16] for the parking lot brother Wayne and
[2:10:18] his father would come down to work on
[2:10:19] the parking lot and y'all remember we
[2:10:21] had had a storm That was supposed to
[2:10:22] come through and as we would begin to
[2:10:24] pray sister Lee would have the her radar
[2:10:26] on her phone the storm would come and
[2:10:28] would split go around and we was eating
[2:10:31] at ranburger and the farmers were
[2:10:33] talking about all around Pon e how much
[2:10:35] rain they got but not paon e you know
[2:10:39] how we didn't have the money for the AC
[2:10:41] you know we didn't have money for
[2:10:43] whatever and God would provide time and
[2:10:46] time and time and time again you know
[2:10:49] the Lord would speak to Moses and said
[2:10:51] Beware lest thou forget how I brought
[2:10:54] you out of the house of bondage whenever
[2:10:56] you're drinking of the wells you didn't
[2:10:58] dig you're eating of The Vineyards you
[2:10:59] didn't plan don't forget I brought you
[2:11:02] here and sometimes it's easy to look at
[2:11:05] the things going wrong the things
[2:11:06] happening circumstances that we forget
[2:11:09] that the reason we're here today is
[2:11:11] because of God and I believe if he
[2:11:13] brought us this far he's not going to
[2:11:15] lose us I don't believe he's forgot
[2:11:17] about you I don't believe he's forgot
[2:11:19] about this church but we're looking
[2:11:20] forward
[2:11:22] we're remembering how God has brought us
[2:11:23] this far and we're not forgetting that
[2:11:26] he can continue to take us on do you
