that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed while we're still standing but before we go to prayer I've got uh a couple short Snippets from places where brother Brandon was praying that that I want to read in in the comforter as he's praying he says oh Eternal God author of life and Giver of all good gifts sanctify our unclean hearts Lord May the angel come from the altar with the tongs and with a coal of fire and touch our lips and our hearts and purify our thoughts and our minds and our souls that when we take this kosher bread that we may do it in the remembrance of Our Lord for it is written he that eats and drinks unworthily is guilty oh God may we not be condemned with the world but may we be Sanctified and set apart from the world that we might be shining lights as the word of God being made manifest in our lives use us as your servants Lord use us all together for we ask it in jesus' name amen and in the sermon it is I once again as he's praying Lord the god of creation of the heavens and earth who made all things by Christ Our Lord who sent him to be the propitiation of our sins giving us his word which is the water of Separation Washed by the Water through the the word of Separation that through faith believing that we are separated from our sins called out set apart ordained to the gospel of the Lord Jesus the good news goes all the way from the pulpit Lord to the little housewife that could testify and tell of the goodness of our blessed savior let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord we've sung songs to Worship You Lord we've we've prayed we've we've done our best to to set the atmosphere Lord for for you to be able to to take charge of the service Lord and Lord I pray that right now you would just help me to step aside Lord that you would Lord take the the few thoughts that I've put together Lord the the scriptures and the quotes and Lord that you would be the one that to take control of it Lord that you would be the one to inspire the words Lord that you would be the one to to minister to to the hearts and to the needs Lord Lord may I just be a vessel that can be used for you Lord but may you be the one that that speaks that that touches the hearts of your people Lord we just we thank you for allowing us to gather once again Lord and we just commit the rer the service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats Isaiah chapter 41 and verse eight it says but thou Israel art my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend thou whom I have taken from the ends of the Earth and called from the chief men thereof and said unto the Thou Art my servant I have chosen thee and not cast thee away and Isaiah chapter 44 starting at verse one yet now here oh Jacob my servant and Israel whom I have chosen thus sayeth the Lord that made thee and formed the from the room from the womb which will help thee fear not oh Jacob my servant and now just run whom I have chosen for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine Offspring and they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water courses one shall say I am the Lords and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord and surname himself by the name of Israel okay now when we break into the story of Abraham as we were beginning to read here there's really nothing that is written about what kind of man Abram was before God called him it doesn't lay out that he was a good man it doesn't lay out that he was an evil man it doesn't lay out that he was this or that he was just there we go through his lineage we go through the line that he came from but God doesn't give us anything that would try to set him apart as wow this is what was special about him this is why I chose him he doesn't lay out anything like that he simply goes Abra right I want you to separate yourself and I want you to go off he doesn't say it's well you know Abram had rejected the gods of his of his people he had turned away from this and so it was the right time to call him he doesn't go in about how well Abram clung to the beliefs of his grandfather or great-grandfather or anything it doesn't tell us that it's not setting Abram as being something special or being something that is different than what was there what was different was that he was chosen what was different was that God looked down and saw something on the inside and said that's the one I want what was different was that God could look at him and go I know what he's going to do in the future I know how he'll respond I know how he'll handle the different things he's the one I want it wasn't because of anything he had done in the past it wasn't because of anything he had done to make himself worthy it was because of what God could see in him and God could know Abram Abraham is my friend that he would be able to look at him before he got to that point and go this man is going to be my friend this man is going to be someone that I can talk to this this is going to be someone that will listen to what I have to say that will follow my Commandments that will do what I tell him to do was he a perfect man no but the character was there that God was looking for the character was there that God could look at him and say that's mine that's the one that I want that's right in the sermon Abraham says now Abraham came down to the land of CH caldia in the city of er to well there and they probably lived a pretty fair life in those days he probably picked berries for his breakfast and go in the bush and kill an animal for his no day and then eat some more berries at night and so forth and he fared pretty good but one day while he was walking around at 75 years old and he had married his Half Sister Sarah when they was just a girl and she was 65 years old she was 10 years younger than Abraham and Abraham walking around God called Abraham by Grace by election he called Abraham and chose him among all the men in the world God called Abraham because he wanted to give Abraham his Covenant yeah in faith it says now Abraham was called by election Abraham is election Isaac is justification Jacob is Grace and Joseph is perfection now in the beginning when God called Abraham he called him not because he was a good man but because God fornew Abraham God knew what Abraham would do he knowed Abraham he said I know that Abraham will raise his children to fear the lord God knowed him God knows you in Hebrews chap 11 and starting at verse 8 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations and whose Builder and maker is God once again in the serum Abraham he says he told Abraham said now separate yourself from among your people that's the best thing to do come out from among it get away from it someone said well I still go to the pool room I think I think maybe I could win some of the boys stay out of the pool room stay off the Devil's Ground that's right you'll never do it that way set separate yourself and show your color be a Christian and act like it live like it talk like it people will believe it notice Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men to me lift him up in your life in your living and in what you do the first thing that when God comes to to Abram and lets him know that I'm choosing you the first thing he said says is separate yourself there it's not recorded in Scripture that the Lord had come and talk to Abram before this could he have sure but I think it probably would have been in the scriptures but God came and talked to Abram and his first command is separate leave your family behind leave your friends behind leave everything that you know behind and go to a place that I'm going to show you I'm choosing you and now it's time for you to be different I'm choosing you and it's time for you to step away from everything he didn't say okay Abram I choose you and now I want you to go witness to your neighbors I want you to go witness to your friends I want you to go witness to your co-workers he didn't say any of that it was I choose you now leave because say we need to get away together the two of us we need to be separated so that everyone can see there's a difference here everybody can see that there's something different in the way that you're living and you can see that there's something different in the way that you're acting and the way that you're carrying yourself and the way that you're handling situations you've been chosen and now you need to leave and you need to be separated isn't interesting how that's the pairing that we immediately find out is when God chooses his First Act is you need to separate you need to separate from the world that you've known you need to separate from the world that you've previously been a part of and instead you need to come into what I'm calling you to you need to come into what I've set aside for you where the place that I've called you to be 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 starting at verse 14 it says now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice Evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ if you run through this section of scripture verse by verse everything about it is going to be going hey I want you to be different than the world I want you to not render evil for evil hey first off we're going to break the Old Testament notion of eye for an eye we're already moving away from that so don't render evil for evil don't try to get even hey they hurt me okay ignore it forgive continue on don't render evil for evil ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice everm more okay Evermore is always ever more is continually Evermore isn't Rejoice now and then tomorrow when you're upset at work stop rejoicing or it's not rejoice now and then tomorrow when the kids are acting up stop rejoicing it's Rejoice ever more keep rejoicing keep being thankful keep praising pray without ceasing in everything give thanks it's kind of hard to be complaining if we're continually being thankful if we're focusing on well Lord I'm thankful for this it's kind of hard to be complaining about whatever situation or whatever problem and so we run through these verses and God is laying out through Paul you're separated you're supposed to be different you're supposed to be carrying yourself in a different way you're supposed to be acting a different way that verse 22 in in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 it's abstained from all appearance of evil he's not saying abstain from Evil he's saying abstain from the very appearance it might not be evil but if it looks or seems like someone could think that you were doing evil don't do it that's right even if it's fine even if you don't have the slightest guilt you don't have the slightest condemnation in doing it if you think there's a possibility that it could be taken as evil that someone looking at it could go he's doing the wrong thing or she's acting the wrong way abstain from the very appearance of evil I think this is one of those where as Christians it's all too easy for us to get wrapped up up in hey these are the rules as long as I follow these rules and don't do these things I'm fine we start to forget abstain from the appearance of evil we're going oh I'm fine to do this it's not wrong but how does it look you know we may be really good at holding ourselves to what God has told us to do and we all know that we struggle with that even but on the things that we do we go like hey I don't drink check I can check that one off the list I don't struggle with alcohol at all I'm good but have you ever ordered something in a restaurant that was served in a wine glass or was served in some sort of vessel that's not the normal cup could that appear like you're drinking something you're not supposed to I'm just throwing out a simple thought I'm not trying to condemn anyone on this I'll let you take your own mind wherever you want on this but we're supposed to abstain from the very appearance what are things that are in our lives that they're not wrong but how do they look how do they appearer how could people look at us and judge us thinking that maybe we're doing wrong could we be spoiling some of our testimony with something that's not wrong because of how it appears we're called to be a separated people in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 starting at verse 9 it says but take heed lest by any means this Liberty of yours become a stumbling Bo to them that are weak for If any man see thee which Hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols Temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy know knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died but when ye sin so against the Brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against Christ wherefore if meat make my brother offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest I make my brother to offend abstain from the very appearance of evil Paul was writing very clear he like look it's not a sin to eat this meat he's saying it straight up this is not a sin you're not going to go to hell because you ate this meat but if by doing that I hurt someone with weaker Faith or weaker Revelation or a weaker place in the body if I hurt them because I ate this meat then I am sinning and I there is a problem and so I'm going to choose to abstain from something that is not a sin to protect my brother to protect my sister sometimes we think that if I hold myself to these guidelines if the sisters are making sure that they're wearing skirts and loose flowing dresses and that they're dressing modestly and they're doing all these different things then I'm good they've checked off all the boxes they're doing everything that they're supposed to but is there something else going on in their lives and brothers we don't even get that as our testimony we can't even go out and I mean I go out like this and I can run into lots of guys that are dressed the same way as Me Maybe maybe not a tie right now but if I lose the tie I can pretty much blend in with most anyone up there so I don't even have my clothing to go here's part of my testimony but how easy it for me to go out and I'm doing something that's not a sin but yet it has the appearance of evil or it could make them question my testimony just a little bit or is it something that I'm comfortable with I have a revelation about that I know is safe but maybe my brother doesn't or my sister doesn't is it okay for me to do it in front of them when we really start to go into it the standards we're supposed to be living by is so much higher than what we will talk about even we'll talk about our dress we'll talk about not drinking not doing drugs not doing this not doing that we'll talk about all those things but Paul is here writing going abstain from the appearance and if you think that this could possibly damage the faith or make one of your brothers question their belief then don't do it you know we were talking about when I was just talking about we don't drink let's go into that for just a moment Ephesians 5 and verse 18 says and be not drunk with wine wear in in excess but be filled with the spirit 1 Timothy Chapter 5 and verse 22 lay hands suddenly on no man neither be part Akers of other men's sins keep thyself pure drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach Sate and th often infirmities well hang on if I'm reading that verse wouldn't that mean it's okay to have a glass of wine now and then I mean Paul's instructing Timothy drink some wine can anyone argue that that's what he's saying that's he told him drink some wine okay so so so hang on this means that we have a Biblical reason of I could have a glass of wine and it would be okay I could do this and if that was the Revelation that I had I could go hey I can drink this and have no guilt and have no condemnation because the scripture says it says do not be drunken but it says you can have a little wine so as long as I'm not taking it too far it's okay Leviticus 10 and verse 8 and the Lord spake unto Aaron saying do not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy Sons with thee when you go into the Tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute forever throughout your generation and that you may put difference between holy and Unholy and between unclean and clean and you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses Judges 13 and verse3 and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and beest not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines Luke 1 and verse 13 but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord it was part of the Nazarite vow it was part of those that were set apart that were separated that they wouldn't drink wine or strong drink that they wouldn't partake of anything that could affect their mind that could affect their actions that could affect the way they would respond to the world around them they weren't supposed to be under any other Spirits is another way to describe it they were separated yeah now we could go back and forth and you could have all kinds of debates about well maybe it's okay to have a little wine because Paul told Timothy this and if that's your honest belief fine I don't need to convince you different abstained from the very appearance of evil I will refuse to eat meat if it could harm my brother I don't need to go any further on that we could debate alcohol all you want but if we're supposed to abstain from the appearance and if Paul was willing to stop eating just meat all of us eat meat probably multiple times a day he was willing to I will not eat meat if it could offend my brother how much more is Paul going to say I will not drink wine if it could offend my brother God called Abraham to be separated to leave what he knew and the world that was around him to be different so when God calls us and chooses us he is calling us to a separation he is calling us to separation to be set apart to be different than everything that's around us you know as I'm going into this I will apologize up front this is going to be the most meddlesome service I have ever preached so as we're continuing forward I came across this quote and it was so I got really excited when I read it because I could immediately see how people would want to pick this up and cut it off in the middle in the sermon forsaking all brother brandom says or here in Arizona rather not too many of them are wearing makeup that was fought against too well there's nothing in the Bible to say for you not to wear makeup cut walk away brother brandom said there is nothing in the Bible to say you shouldn't wear makeup there's going to be people that take this quote and they hang it up on the wall they put it on their mirror so every day when they do they do their makeup they can say I'm good brother brandom said there is nothing in the Bible to say I shouldn't wear makeup and it's it's right here he preached it in 1962 January 23rd it's paragraph 246 if there's somebody wanting this quote paragraph 246 the sermon is called for aking all it's right there it's in black and white but there's a little bit more to the quote or here in Arizona rather not too many of them are wearing makeup that was fought against too well there's nothing in the Bible to say for you not to wear makeup we just know it's wrong because it's of the world but there is a commandment in the Bible that a woman cuts her hair as a dishonorable person and it looks that way way to God and you say you got the Holy Ghost and doing so something wrong to wear a garment that pertains to a man oh sister dear don't pattern after the world forsake the world hold to Christ you say what difference does it make blessed is he that does all of his Commandments that me he might have the right to enter into the Tree of Life guilty of the least is guilty of the whole and I'm sure you all know the next quote that I'm going to go to but first 2 Kings chapter 9 and verse 30 and when J was come to jezel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window now in the rejected King in 1960 brother brand is preaching in he says one lady said to me said why do you think it's wrong for a woman to wear some of this makeup I said yes sir I do said God never if he'd have maybe wanted you to look like you was a barn he'd have made you a barn I said paint it up all like that if he' wanted you to smoke he'd put a smoke stack on top of you some flu so that you could have breathed it out but he gave you lungs to breathe good fresh air that's what he did for but they oh no they don't nobody don't want the Holy Spirit to judge them now if you get the Holy Ghost and can still live that way you come to me and tell me you got the Holy Ghost and living like that I can't be your judge but according to the word you've missed the line somewhere brother that's right that's exactly what the spirit says that's right we need back Holiness again come back to God yes they reject it certainly do they do they don't want to do it don't want to come under the jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit they don't want the spirit to guide them let me tell you something ladies I'm not making fun of you this is no place for that this is the place for judgment Goes Forth and judgment has to go right and judgments by the word of God looking there was only one woman in the entire Bible that ever painted her face that's right right one woman and she never painted her face to meet God she painted her face to meet a man to try to Vamp him J Jezebel you know what God did for her he fed her to the dogs that's right so you see a woman wearing makeup you say that's Miss dog meat that's exactly what it is for God he fed her to the dogs so that's all she stood for were dogs he fed her the dogs how many knows that's the truth say amen that's exactly right there's nothing in the Bible to say for you not to wear makeup it's wrong because it's of the world now we can pick on makeup with that quote but how many other things in our lives that we say it's okay but yet if we really step back and look at it we go you know what it's wrong because it's of the world I'm already meddling so we're going to go a little bit further and this is one it'll come as no surprise you've all heard this preached before but it stood out to me as I was going through these different thoughts we know it's wrong because it's of the world abstain from the very appearance of evil I'm going to keep saying these over and over because these are the statements I want you to have running through your head over and over and over as we go on this Christmas Eve Lord we're grateful for the gift of God for God giving to us though this be some as we believe in our hearts some Pagan Superstition of a day that they've tried to mold it and make it like a mass Christ Mass but we are not coming in that way of Santa Claus and Christmas trees and decorations but we are coming in the name of the Lord Jesus to worship the god of Heaven that was made incarnate flesh like us and dwelt among us to redeem us and suffered the reproach of the name suffered the reproach of the Cross to let a worldly institution put Emanuel to death in order he could bring us to eternal life the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives he says how I can't understand where a rabbit has anything to do with the resurrection see no sir how a Christmas tree has anything to do with the chis with the birth of Christ it's Pagan friends we've got off the path somewhere that's right but now real born again man or woman realizes because there's life within you tells you that that's wrong is that right and in why I had to be a Shepherd brother brandom says and give us the spirit the true Spirit of CH Christmas when today when Pagan ceremonies Christmas trees worshiped fiction stories of a man named Santa Claus and of our Easter rabbits and the different fashions that the commercial world is capitalized on may be laid as as side God let us enter into Christ the word for we asked it in his name and for his glory amen now I think that you could put the word Christmas tree into that quote in place of the word makeup there is nothing in the scripture to say you can't have a Christmas tree there is not just a straight scripture that goes you shouldn't have a Christmas tree you shouldn't have this great but we know we shouldn't do it because it's of the world abstain from the very appearance of evil we can get into arguments and debates with people around the message well brother brandham had a Christmas tree great this brother or sister or this pastor or this Whoever has a Christmas tree wonderful if that is their conviction I'm not going to be the one to try to convince them one way or another that's not my job or my calling that's not my role it's not my role to get onto some chat and have a great big debate over why a Christmas tree is wrong or why makeup is wrong or why insert topic is wrong but if brother brandham could look at something like makeup and he could say straight up there's nothing in the scripture to say you shouldn't wear it but we know it's wrong because it's of the world we know the scripture tells us abstain from the appearance of evil how much more should we be able to apply that to the other places of Our Lives if you're comfortable with a Christmas tree in your home wonderful good for you that's fine that's between you and God and if that's where you don't have if you don't have conviction there great enjoy it I'll be the one first first one to tell you around Christmas time my wife and I like to go out and look at all the decorations that are up around their towns can look really pretty with all the lights and everything if they decorated the same way in the middle of summer we'd go look at had it then I go when the lights are up it happens to be around Christmas but that's when we go if they put up a Christmas tree with lights and lit up the Town Square for July 4th I'd go look at it July 4th but we can get so wrapped up in these debates over well this is right or this is wrong or you know there's no scripture saying we should do this or no scripture saying we shouldn't do that but yet we start to forget that the scripture says abstain from the appearance of evil and the scripture says that Paul would avoid eating meat if he thought it could possibly offend his brother so if I think that having a Christmas tree in my home could possibly offend my brother why would I have a Christmas tree in my home even if I personally think there's nothing wrong with it we've heard brother Wendell preach on it we know where he stands it's very clear and I'm honestly leaving all those arguments off to the side because at this moment it's about what the scripture says so clearly I can stand here and I could say well I don't have a conviction about having a Christmas tree in my home wonderful but what about your brother that you're going to tempt by doing it or your sister that you're going to tempt by doing it if Paul was willing to not eat meat I'm going to skip meals because it could offend my brother then how much more should we be willing to give up some of these other things if brother brandom could look at something like makeup and say there's nowhere in the scripture that says it's wrong but we know it's wrong because it's of the world then how much more should we be looking at our own lives to go you know there's nothing in the scripture that says this is wrong but maybe I should abstain because I could be offending my brother or sister we talk all the time and I think we all understand the bar is set so high that we'll without God's grace we'll never touch it much less reach it they won't even brush our fingers upon it but yet sometimes I think even knowing it's that high sometimes in our mind we think maybe it's a little bit lower than it actually is because we go hey this is okay the Bible doesn't say this is wrong or the Bible doesn't say this is wrong or I'm not convicted I'm good to do this but yet God this is one of those where we go hey does the scripture say anything about the internet no it doesn't say the Internet by name I mentioned that on Wednesday night it doesn't talk about the internet by name great but abstain from the appearance of evil and I will abstain from things that could cause my brother to be tempted that could offend my brother if you look at life through that filter if you look through at a lot of these things through that filter and if we actually use that I think a lot of our decisions would be different and I'm preaching to myself as much as anyone I could start going through my life and cataloging going you know if I had actually been thinking through this filter I probably wouldn't have done that even though today I might still be sitting here going that's not wrong I was fine to do it but then you look at through this filter changes a little bit we get so wrapped up in trying to argue the ins and outs of the message or the ins and outs of scripture over yes but this is right or this is why I allow this or this but great shove all the debates I know I'm not interested and it's really hard for me to say that because I actually like debating it's my personality I go for that but shove all the debates through those lenses is there even still a debate in the rejected King brother brandom said God's people is never to act like the world or look like the world or be anything to do with the world you are a separated people the church a called out people A peculiar people a royal pries Ood a holy nation allog together different and set aside and all your actions and habits and ways from the things of the world when you're chosen God's first call is separation God's first call is you know the things that you used to do walk away the places you used to go walk away often the people you used to hang out out with walk away now it's not necessarily 100% of them maybe some of them were good people maybe some of them were the ones that were witnessing to you but probably 99.9% of them you walk away am you can keep the 0.1% God calls us to have separation when he chooses us because he's calling us to be in a different place he's calling us has to be a different kind of people in the era of God's Deliverance he says brother if you've ever going going to make a stand for God make it now this is the time now's the time when we need it Now's the Time when the church is weighed in the balance and found wanting after all these great Miracles and signs and wonders that God has sent men across the country doing and yet the church is the poor EST black backslid State I have ever run in years that's right I'm preaching to Pentecostals amen when I first come among your group 10 years ago it looked like a church but today it looks like the world it's the truth something happened somewhere you got to wearing better clothes got to making a little more money and it just made a sap out of you that's all that's the truth that's right you're trying to act like the rest of the world you'll see today is a compromising time that's true you paint your steps red and watch and see if your neighbor don't paint his steps red you wear a little round hat to church with a feather up on it watch all the little all the women come to church with a little round hat and a feather up it that's right all of them want to look like one another it's a matching time you know that's true it's a matching time that must have went home that's right listen this is true now I'm going to tell you brother I don't care whether my shoes match my trousers or my trousers matches my coat I want my experience to match God's Bible That's the matching time if you want to match something match your experience against Paul's amen that's what we need today is a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible that's our example real matching time don't try to match your neighbor match some of the Saints of the Bible if you're a saint act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint shout like a saint be like a saint live like a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a saint amen in the sermon Oneness but God's chosen ones are commanded to come out from among them be ye separated sayith God and I will receive you touch not their worldly things and I'll be the father to you or God and you'll be my sons and daughters yoke yourself not up with unbelievers but come out of it God wants separation from the world he wants to be unionized with you himself and no man-made scheme of organization denomination or any man-made theories will ever stand it'll take God the holy ghost in you to unite you to God and in a thinking man's filter it's a separated congregation it's for no one else it's only for those your chosen as the red heer's water of Separation was for the congregation of Israel only so father we know that the bread is for the Sheep only Jeremiah chap 10 veres 2-4 thus sayith the Lord learn not the way of the Heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven for the heathens are dismayed at them for the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of the forest and the work of the hands of the work with the axe they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and hammers that it move not now I'll admit I have used this scripture as my reason for not having a Christmas tree before because it sounds a lot like a Christmas tree but you can also take it as they were making Idols they were taking wood shaping it putting gold and silver on it whichever one it's actually that verse two right there very clear it's thus sayeth the Lord learn not the way of the Heathen you're called to be a separated people while you're here on this Earth you're called to be different don't learn the way of the Heathen while you're there abstain from the very appearance of evil and how do we know some of the things are evil because they're of the world learn not the way of the Heathen it's so easy for us to get wrapped up in the different things that are going on around usan it's like what brother Wendell's been talking about with the phones recently hey I work in a job where I need to have my email I need to have multiple different messaging apps and different things that are required for the job that I do I could not go back to a dumb phone if I wanted to because if I went back to it I couldn't do my job this is what's required I'm required to have access to the internet I'm required to be able to do different things and access different things and get different information and all these kind of things because that is my job and I will freely admit I happen to love my job I happen to love what I do but there are these restrictions that now hey I couldn't get away from the internet completely if I wanted to and unfortunately I'm not saying that I do want to but this is the point I'm living in a world that requires me to have this if I'm going to provide for my family and take for them this is what I have to have you know some of the brothers that are are business owners I'm sure there are certain things that they kind of need these phones that they can be able to access certain information they would probably have a little bit of difficulty running their businesses if they just went back to an old dumb phone that didn't have access to anything other than a phone call it would make things a little more difficult to operate a business in this day and age it would make it a little more difficult for them to even find the job they're supposed to go to I'd be willing to bet most of them use Google Maps or Apple Maps to find where they're going if they had to pull a paper map out to find it they might never make it to their job it'd be a struggle we live in a world that requires us to do certain things and so we can't look at every single thing that's out there and go this is of the world I can't touch it we are still living in the world we are still having to to conduct business we are still having to take care of different things I mean look we're looking at bringing on an app for our tithes if we're supposed to get away from the internet this kind of makes it hard now but I'll be the first one to say I pay a lot of bills online I don't I don't mail that many envelopes and checks anymore most of my bill pay is online which means I save the stamp which is great of course then I'm paying for my internet I don't know which one's the winner but but whether it's paying our bills whether it's performing our jobs whether it's doing our tithes are offering we are in a world that is requiring us to do certain certain things and so we can't simply offhand completely reject because well that's of the world I'm done I'm not suggesting that I'm not trying to say because if we reject it because it's of the world every one of us is walking home tonight CU I can't be in that car Hey Brother brandom talked multiple quotes about how many people the car kills and it's from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil so if I'm rejecting the world off hand every one of us is walking home and the Cochrans and the lancasters have really long walks this is still the filter that we apply yes you're applying it with some common sense we have to drive cars to work in this Society to be able to get to the grocery store to be able to get anywhere and do anything to be able to get get to church we have to drive cars we have to have these types of phones and able to get certain things done we have to have email or we have to have whatever because this is what we have to do to Simply live here but yet I can look at it through that filter to go hey do I need every single one of these social media accounts that I could possibly get or should May maybe I filter out a few of these hey if I've got a business sure maybe I want to have a business listing on one of these because I'm trying to grow my business wonderful I don't have the slightest problem with it maybe you're using it to connect to this or connect to that or whatever there are valid reasons for some things but if I'm using this filter then maybe there are a few of these things that should be filtered out because maybe it's a little too easy to look up that girl that you used to know years and years ago or that guy You Used To Know years and years ago or look up how this old buddy is doing and maybe we can reconnect and suddenly things that God called you to separate from are starting to creep back in because we're allowing something else to regrow the connection boy I am meddling tonight I am all over the place if we take this filter abstain the very appearance of evil and I won't do anything that could offend my brother that could tempt my brother that could make them think when they have the conviction it's wrong that I could make them think it's okay and could possibly make them sin or Make Them Fall there are lots of areas in our lives we can run through this and it would take me far too long to talk about all of them but taking that time to apply it to your own life is okay what are the areas that maybe I should apply this filter to that should be gone yeah there are the things that I have to have to live and work and operate and be in this world in this Society I'm not trying to turn a Amish the sermon perseverant a Nazarite means separated to the word what a nice thing you would be tonight if all Christians would be nazarites to the Lord separated not to Creeds but to the word Christ is that word separated to the word I think it's way too easy for all of us even in the message to start to go hey this is my Creed whether it's written out or whether it's just in your heart or your mind this is my Creed so this is what I believe is okay this is the things I believe are wrong this is this this or that that's why I keep pointing back to this filter and yes I'm stomping all over my own toes tonight as well but I keep pointing back going if we're supposed to abstain from the appearance of evil how many of these things that are in our own personal Creeds may not be Church Creeds our own personal Creeds that we go this is okay for my family this is okay for me in my personal life this is okay for me whatever that that filter is going to make you cast to the side 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 20 now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God now the official term for the official definition for an ambassador is an credited Diplomat sent by a country as its official representative to a foreign country God chose us he chose us and basically invited us to be his Ambassador he said hey I want you brother Colby I want you and and I want you to be my Ambassador in this age of leoda I'm going to send you from my kingdom into that Kingdom and you're going to be the ambassador for me and he invited he called he asked you if you would become his Ambassador and for each one of us maybe the story is a little bit different maybe he had to ask you multiple times maybe in your life it was he asked you the first time and you immediately accepted but eventually however long or short it may have been brother kby was like yes Lord I'll be your Ambassador and then there was a ceremony to to publicly declare this is now one of my ambassadors there was a public declaration as brother Colby was baptized in front of witnesses that he was now different he was now in a different place and this ceremony was in front of however many it may have been I'm picking on him tonight but so there was a public ceremony that declared to all those that were present that this is now one of my ambassadors in the leot AG brother kby is mine I chose him I called him I invited him he accepted Ed and now this ceremony declaring and in response to his declaration to the Lord the Lord sealed him back with his own declaration I'm going to fill you with the holy spirit so Colby makes a public declaration yes I accept you Lord I will serve you I will be your Ambassador and the Lord goes yes I will now make a public Declaration of my own I will fill you I will seal you and there will now be something inside you to maintain you being set apart to teach you to instruct you if you think about it in some ways when they someone is when this ceremony if we go into the political world and someone is selected as an ambassador in some ways it's the same way as what brother brandham described when you had the ceremony of adoption and that now there's an authority that goes along with it because now I'm publicly declaring this is the ambassador to China or this is the ambassador to wherever and in that there is now an authority there they have the right to write out certain checks to sign them to do these different things they have an authority because they have have been publicly Chosen and announced this is my Ambassador oras in the ceremony of adoption this is my son his signature is just as good on the check as mine questions and answers on Hebrews an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that Ambassador and he said go ye to the all the world you are my Witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come on you and what is a witness is an ambassador is to come and witness something the whole power of Heaven is right in your hands in adoption he said and then if God has sent us to be his ambassadors all the power that's in heaven all that God is all his angels and all of his power stands behind our words if we are correctly and ordained sent Messengers to the people God has to honor the word word for he has solemnly written that whatever you bind on Earth that will I bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth that will I loose in heaven and I give unto the the Kings to the the keys to the kingdom oh such great promise he's given the church now we know from the political world as an ambassador there's certain expectations about the way that they carry themselves about the way that they act about the way that they conduct business the Ambassador can't go and simply do whatever they think is best in that moment they have to be doing what the person that sent them thinks is best that's their job their job is to represent where they were sent from they're not there to represent their own interests they're not out out there to better themselves and get themselves to be in a better financial position or build their own wealth they are there to represent and watch out for the one that sent them when we are sent as ambassadors God is calling us to carry out his will in this age he is calling us to live in a way that represents his kingdom he is calling us to live a life that represents the kingdom of God abstain from the very appearance of evil don't damage the office you've been given don't let anyone even look at it and think that they could put a mark on your reputation because of something that you said or did that maybe it wasn't wrong but it looked a little off God's calling us to so much more than simply here's the rule book follow the rule book he's calling us to represent him in everything we do every moment that we're at work or on the job site every moment that we're in front of our children teaching them and taking care of them whether it's the moms at home whether it's the dads after we come home we have to represent talking to us men when we come home from work and we're tired and we're wore out and maybe we're a little frustrated God is still calling us to maintain a witness in front of our children just because I walked through the door at home doesn't mean I now get to vent everything out that I've been holding in because there are still some little eyes that are watching me that are going hey so how does Dad handle it when he had a bad day at work how does Mom handle it when the kids were awful all day when they got into everything when they spread the dirt throughout the house they went and they dumped soap in my cake batter how is Dad gonna act when he walks in after he's already frustrated from work and he finds a frustrated wife and kids at home is he going to be the one to come in and calm down the situ situation or is he going to toss gasoline on the fire and see just how much can burn oh I've had days where I've done both I've had plenty of days where I came home and I I dumped gasoline on the fire I made it worse I was not coming in and applying the Holy Ghost on my home but then there have been the days where I've come home and I've been able to do it right I'm not going to say which one I did more of but God is calling us to carry ourselves in a certain way to represent him in everything that we do sometimes it's easier for us to remember it when we're out on the job site because we know we're around the world we're around the people that don't believe I have to make sure that I carrying myself correctly I have to make sure that I am representing everything the way that I should and then how easy is it for us to Let It Drop at home and not continue to think wait I've got four sets of eyes soon to be five they're going to be watching me to see how dad handles it to see what my response is Galatians chapter 4 verse one it says now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in the bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ and hear ye him he said and with this adoption taking place that boy's name was just as good on the check as his daddy's was everything the father had was his read the Old Testament adoption laws and find out that's right if not certainly is that son could walk down the street and this fellow wasn't doing right he could say here straighten up that meant so if he fired the man he was fired if he wrote a check and paid this off the bank will recognize the check just his name was just as good as his father's after he'd been adopted not because he was born because he was adopted or placed God has placed us into this position of authority and brother brandom talked about it when this boy was under the tutors the father was listening to the reports because he was waiting to hear enough good reports and hear that the boy had the kind of character that needed to be before he would adopt him it was wasn't he was just waiting yeah when he turns 16 we're going to adopt him it's all good he was looking for a certain character he was looking for something that he could say yes I can trust this to my son I can trust my son to represent me when he goes out and it's the same way when you look at it from the standpoint of someone being the uh Ambassador and going out they're going to do interviews they're going to go through a selection process because they're trying to find somebody that will represent them to the best of their ability now nowadays it's probably more about political did this guy give enough funds to my campaign did he do this did he do that great you're going to represent me but the way it's meant to be is could I trust this person to represent the interests that I have to get done what I want to have done to represent what I feel is the best decision while he's thousands of miles away and God looked down through time and he looked at the age of leoa and he looked at everything that was going to be going around all the Temptations all the struggles all the problems that would be faced and he went you know what brother Ken that's that's who I want in that age brother Joe that's going to be one of my ambassadors brother Caleb Martin I want him there put your name in God looked down through time looked at the age the worst age that could be and he said this is the one that I trust to represent my interests in that Kingdom this is the one I trust to live out my desires and my commands in that Kingdom God looked down and he was not slovenly about choosing who would be the best he didn't just throw the names in a hat draw and go oh yeah this guy will be there and this guy will be there but he looked down and he went there's a character in this brother and in this sister and he went and he said sister Carol I'm choosing you to be born in that native tribe and to be my Ambassador in that world to a people that they might not want to hear what I would say look I'll be the first one to tell you I'm as white as they get I do not even really tan well I go to burn and back to pale it's what I do God didn't choose me to put me in that spot but God looked and said sister Carol brother Donald those are going to be my ambassadors brother Mike King that's one of my ambassadors and they can go and they will be able to stand and they will be able to witness and they will be able to carry themselves in a manner that others will look at them and go there's something different in how they carry themselves in the things that they say and the things that they do and I can trust them to act in my best interests in leoda I can trust them to act in that area of leoda I can trust brother William to act in this area I can trust brother Ken to be here and brother kby to be here and brother uh Jonah and pick put your name and the same thing with every sister I will trust you with the most precious I'm going to trust you to raise those little ones not just I'm going to trust you to work in the world and be around them and maybe be a w is I'm going to trust you to teach them from birth about me I'm going to trust you to teach them about the Lord from the moment that you start singing Sunday school songs to them to help them go to sleep because that's the position I've given you not only are you an ambassador to the world you are also the teacher of the most precious things coming up God doesn't give any of us like Duty as ambassadors he doesn't send any of us to the uh to put it in a political world none of us are getting sent to England none of us get to go sit in an allies nation that we speak the same language that we do this that we do that we are all getting sent to the country that is on the front lines we're all getting sent to the country where we are surrounded by pretty much enemies all around not the people but the spirits we are ambassadors in a time of War we don't get the easy assignments we don't get placed in an easy place but yet at the same time we have a king that looked on us and went I can trust you because of the character that's on the inside to represent my interests in Le oia and because I can trust you to do that I can also trust you with this Authority that when you sign the check it's just as good in the sermon choosing of a bride it was interesting when I first started getting interested in looking into the idea of being chosen that was where it started I was just focusing on being Chosen and I was going through that and so obviously choosing of a bride this is a great sermon to go through I ended up getting very few quotes from it but there was one quote that stood out as I was going through brother Ram's talking in the choosing of a bride he says phone PA phone call just come in a little while ago this morning a member of my church which is really a Baptist woman out of Louisville she died early this morning and my church at home a real group of consecrated men assembled themselves together and went down before the Undertaker and balmed her stood over her prayed until life came back in her and she is living tonight the Elders of my church why they've been taught to believe that all things are possible come to God sincerely brother brandom didn't testify of hey I went and prayed for this woman and she came back to life sure he had plenty of those testimonies but he went and said hey I'm not even there I'm out out of state preaching a sermon over here I forget where this sermon was preached but he's off wherever ministering and he says so this sister dies and so a group of consecrated men from my church that know the word of God that know they have the authority they went and they prayed and God answered and she's living tonight amen it didn't take a prophet to go to it it didn't take some amazing Minister that travels the world or this that or the other it took a group of consecrated Believers that went hey we have the authority because we have the word amen and so our prayer is just as effective because it's the same word whether we're praying it or whether the prophet's praying it we're we're sent as ambassadors we have that same Authority now I know I'm not going to do the number of Miracles that happened in brother brandom's Ministries because I don't have that call but that doesn't mean that there can't be a miracle that happens when I pray come on that doesn't mean there can't be a miracle that happens when my wife prays it doesn't mean there can't be a miracle when one of my children pray that's right God didn't put an age cut off saying you have to be at Le least this old before I respond God didn't put a gender cut off God didn't put H this that or the other God looked and said Do You Believe do you have faith do you have faith in my word and can you apply the word that's that's it we're called to be ambassadors we're called to be set apart we were chosen and then the next step God called separation and separated is more than just following a rule book separated is in the very way that we look at the world it's the very way that we respond to the world it's not just following a checklist of okay I got to make sure I check these off every day that I didn't do any of them as long as I didn't do these I'm good as long as I did these I'm good it's the way that we look at things it's the way that we respond to things it's us looking and going hey I'm not out for my own desires or my own Comfort my own development my own wealth my own whatever I'm here on the father's business my job in leoda is to represent him and yes part of my role is to go to work and provide for my family that's part of the things he called me to do but he called me in all those moments to be representing him to be living for him and so this isn't about us trying to argue for why this is okay or that is okay arguing about hey this is why it's okay to have a Christmas tree or hey this is why it's okay to have a French manicure or this is why it's okay to do this or do that or I don't care put in what you want that's not my purpose for being on Earth my purpose is not to debate why I'm right and you're wrong or why this person's wrong and we're both right or whatever my purpose is to represent Christ and represent his interests here on Earth that's what each one of us is called to do we're not called to get drawn into some big debate or some big whatever at least I'm not maybe God gave you that office I'll let you figure that out yourself but I'm not called to go into that now I'll be the first one to say brother Wendell as a pastor is called to get into it at least a little bit that's his role I'm not a pastor so I'm not called to get into the debates like that that's not my role but each one of us and that's brother Wendell included are called to represent Christ in everything that we do we are called to act out in the interests of Christ in everything that we do that's we are called to live for him we are called to live a life that anyone that looks at us would go that's a Christian we are called to live a life that is above reproach we are called to abstain from the very appearance of evil I don't know how you can make the calling any higher it's not abstained from Evil it's the very appearance this is what we're called to so that means I can take my checklist and throw it out the window because it's not just abstained from Evil it's the appearance we are supposed to live a life so high so close to God so directly on every word that was spoken God went and chose a bride that would think his thoughts thoughts that wouldn't be acting in her own interest but her every response would be the heart of Christ because the holy spirit is indwelling her the holy spirit is guiding her and the Holy Spirit is Christ I don't know how to try to make this more plain hopefully I'm making it clear enough that even the kids can get this part that this is what we're called for yes I will love talking to people about okay what did God call you to do in a career because God placed callings on every one of our lives he made brother merel to work for the post office that was his calling that's the only way he lasted there as many years as he did he did not call me to be in the post office brother Merl has shared a few of his stories and I was like I would have been fired or I would have quit it wouldn't have happened I also know that not everyone is called to work at Chick-fil-A not everyone is called to be an electrician not everyone is called to work in Social Services or Plumbing or remodeling or whatever your career is put it in but yet and so I work with a lot of young people and I enjoy having those conversations with them to go okay so what are the things in your life that you would go this is what God is calling me to and designing me for it's not just about finding a career where I make a lot of money it's going this is where God wants me to be and I enjoy that conversation but but at the same time for every one of us that claims to be a Christian we have a purpose so much higher than our career we have something so much more than running our own business or doing this or doing that yes God called you to do this to provide for your family and pay the bills and meet the needs wonderful but he called you to be his representative he called you to represent his Desires in the most evil age when the whole world is going crazy he called you to be there as a beacon of sanity and pointing people to the way to have sanity it's so much more than than just our career it's so much more than even just being and I hate you calling it just being but than just being a father or a mother he's calling us so much more than that you could be a father or mother and make sure the kids' needs are met they're fed they're watered they have a bed to sleep in I'm going to educate them and then I'm going to send them off to the world which will devour them like a pack of lions or a pack of wolves I would still be a father or my wife would be a mother if that's what we did but God's calling us to so much more than that God's calling us to go to a have a bar set that is so much higher because we are his ambassadors representing his desires on earth in every single thing that we do and the possession that the promise that was given to the church is not a natural land but a spiritual land for we are a royal priesthood a holy nation then in this royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people called out elected chosen set aside then all the world is dead on the outside and we are led by the Spirit Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God not by man but by the spirit Revelations 17 and verse1 14 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords and the king of kings and they that are with him are called they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful that's you they are called they are chosen they are faithful and God looked at each one of you said they're called they're chosen they're faithful they're going in leoda because they can handle that that's the character that I'm looking for Ephesians chapter 1 and verse4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love as the musicians come in the church age book in the suban church age he says and this is a little bit of a lengthy quote as we're wrapping up now it says that he hath chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that let me inject a thought in here even our natural birth is based upon election the female ovaries produce many many eggs but why is it that a certain time at a certain egg comes down and not another one and then amongst the male sperm for no reason a certain germ attaches itself to the egg While others that could have just as easily attached themselves or had better opportunity to do so did not do so and perished there is an intelligence behind in all this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy or girl blonde or brunette light or dark type of eyes Etc with these thoughts in mind think about Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say in John 649 your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead those parents that died were necessary as the forefathers of the people to whom Jesus was speaking they perished yet they were in the election of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb were spiritually but to go on those elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name Romans 4:16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all r Romans 9: 7-13 neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of Flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca had also conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Galatians 3:16 now to Abraham and his Seed where the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christor Galatians 3:29 if you be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise according to Romans 4:16 we find that God had given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on not to only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise is having to do with election or the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying those who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated forn of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was made manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now man manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are soall we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken God didn't choose lightly he looked down and he chose because it was his seed already in us he chose because we had been with him from the beginning we he chose because we were in the mind of God from the beginning he chose because we were there with him he wasn't randomly looking down at Leo de and going yeah I think that one will work and I think that one will work and I think that one will work it was before there was anything before he had spoken a word of creation God already in his mind was going there's going to be a brother James Torrance in Le oysa there's going to be a sister Amy Gonzalez in leoa there's going to be a sister Sharon Smith there's going to be a sister Mary Martin there's going to be a sister Denise King a sister Stephanie Lancaster these are my ambassadors in the most evil age they were with me from the beginning they were in me I was in them they are mine I choose them because I can trust them to represent me because they are me I am in them I am guiding them I am teaching them I am instructing them and I redeem them back because they were mine at the beginning and they're coming back to be with me eternally in the [Music] end we are here for so much more than to follow a rule book we are here for so much more than to check off a list of what it takes to be a Christian we are here for so much more than to make sure sure that the sisters are wearing long flowing skirts and have uncut hair and that the brothers have shortcut hair and they're wearing appropriate clothing that they're not running around and whatever we're here for so much more than that because we are his ambassadors we are his spoken word bride we are here to represent his Desires in the age of Le oysa we are here to represent him in the most evil age that has been seen we're not here to argue about this being right or that being right or get wrapped up in well this message Church teaches that and this message Church teaches that and this message Church teaches that that's not what we're here for the Baptists get into those kind of debates the methodists get into those kind of debates the Catholics the lutherans take your pick they all get into those kind of debates about is this okay is that okay is this okay God is calling a United Seed bride to be living out his Desires in Le oysa he didn't make
