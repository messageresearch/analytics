So, I'm really thankful for that here this morning or this evening. And remember, Brother John, he's going to be on the road for another few weeks, a month, something like that.

The pull I felt was more than I could bear. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; And I was on the verge of giving over. Oh, the strength within myself just wasn't there. [singing] Something keeps holding [music] me. Every [singing] day I see he's [music] helping me faithfully to overcome my [music] trials. He's guiding me constantly, [music] giving me victory. [singing] He's a reality. [music] Something keeps holding [singing] me. and Satan [music] and laid before me his temptation. Oh, his [music] desire to steal [singing] away my faith. But I found in time the revelation. [singing] Oh, it's the [music] strength I need to keep [singing] me in his grace. Something keeps holding me. [singing] Every [music] day I see he's helping me faithfully to overcome [singing] my trials. God in me [music] constantly [singing] giving me victory [music] is a reality. Something keeps holding me. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Something keeps holding. Oh, something keeps holding me. Every [music] day I see helping me [singing] faithfully, overcome my [music] trials, God in me constantly, [music] giving me victory. [singing] He's a [music] reality. Something keeps holding me.

None other [music and singing] will do. He is my Yeah. Can you just lift a hand and sing it to him tonight? He is He [music] is my [singing] everything both great and [singing] small. He gave [singing] his life for [music] me. Made everything new. He is my everything. None other will do. Let's sing that one more time. He is my everything. He is my all. He is my everything. [singing] Both great and small. He gave [singing] his life for me. Made everything new. He is my everything. None other will do. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, let's go ahead and turn to [music] Genesis 11. I heard from Brother Wendell a little while ago. He said that the services are going very well up there and he said to make sure to greet all of you and let you know that he was missing you and would be glad to come back home when everything was over. Genesis 11 and we're going to start at verse one. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar. And they dwelt there. And they said one to another, "Go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar." And they said, "Go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven. and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, "Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language, and this they begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech." So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. Brother Random said in the sermon, "God's provided way." He says, "Therefore, we find Nimrod immediately afterwards tried to build him a tower, a religious tower, that if God did destroy the world again, what would he do? He would climb up and take his people and go above the flood, up the tower, and he'd get above it. What did it come to? What become of it? Of all his achievements, make himself a great name, he perished with his tower." Let's go ahead and pray. Lord Jesus, we come into your presence this this evening, Lord. And Lord, I pray that you would, Lord, may you just take control of the remainder of the service, Lord. May you guide my lips, Lord. May you guide what I would say, Lord. And Lord, I pray that you would just help the ears of the hearer, Lord. That they would hear and understand, Lord. And Lord, may something just be said that would be a blessing to the people here, Lord. Lord, we we thank you for your presence, Lord. and we just place the remainder of the service into your hands. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; They said, "Let us build a city and a tower lest we be scattered abroad." And in the church age book, Brother Brandham says that Nimrod set out to accomplish three things. He wanted to build a strong nation. He wanted to propagate his own religion. and he wanted to make a name for himself. And brother Brandham said that he accomplished all three of those things. The the people were looking for a way to escape God's judgment. They wanted to build their own kingdom where they didn't have to obey God or follow his commands or or do &gt;&gt; what he said. They didn't want to be subject to to his judgment. Let's turn to 1st Samuel chapter 8 and we'll start at verse one there. 1st Samuel chapter 8 and verse one. And it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his son judges over Israel. Now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second Abaya. They were judges in Beerseba. But his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after Lucer and took bribes and perverted judgment. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Rama, and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people, and all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected me, rejected thee, but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them." Let's drop down to verse 19. Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and they said, "Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and then our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles." And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, "Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king." And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, "Go ye every man unto his city." They said, "That we may also be like all the nations." The Israelites had decided that they didn't want to continue to live the way that they had been living. They could see the way things worked in the nations around them, and they wanted to do it the same way. They were tired of being different. They wanted to be like everyone else. So they decided to use a system of government instead of just trusting and following God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in the sermon, the rejected king, he says in the days of Samuel, the people were a great deal like they are in all days. They had come to a place that they wanted to be like the other people. And that is just simply a nature with people. People want to impersonate each other. If you go out and buy a certain kind of clothing or a certain automobile, paint your steps a certain color in your house or your steps, porch steps, watch the neighbor. They just can't stand it. They've got to be the same. You go to church and wear a certain kind of hat that's a little different. Next Sunday, you'll have a lot of your sisters with the same kind of hat if they can find it. Somehow another, they just want to act like one another. And that's a good thing if it's used right, if it's used in the right way. But these people in the days of Samuel the prophet, they wanted to act like the Philistines and the Amalachites and the unbelieving and they because they had seen their people was a little more fancy and they were a nation of called out and chosen people and they're not supposed to act like the rest of the people. &gt;&gt; God's people is never to act like the world or or look like the world or be anything to do with the world. You are a separated people, the church, a called out, a peculiar people, a royal p priesthood, a holy nation, altogether different and set aside in all your actions and habits and ways from the things of the world. You know, it's interesting is I started thinking about the way that the worldly systems work today and we're stepping out of the religious realm for a few moments just as we look at the way political systems work and we look at the way different nations work and the way that things happen around us. You know, there's always things in the news. if you're interested in following those kind of things. I I know brother Michael and I actually talked a little bit about that just a little while ago. Um, and it's something that's kind of interesting if you want to follow it. And it's so easy to get wrapped up into it. And we get so wrapped up in is this way of governing better than that way of governing? Is is this the way to do things? Is that the way to do things? You know, you'll hear people talking about the differences between communism and socialism and capitalism and this isism, that is, yada yada yada yada. Go through all the lists and talking about, okay, here are the pros, here are the cons, here's this is why you should do it this way, this is why you should do it that way. And obviously, we know that America is built more as the the capitalist type nation for the way that we we handle things and do things. And so there's this battle going on between, okay, socialism is trying to sneak in or capitalism trying to sneak in or these different things. &gt;&gt; And you'll hear people, like I said, debating the the pros and the cons. Is this better? Is that better? &gt;&gt; And it's very easy in Christian circles to start to get wrapped up in that, to start getting wrapped up in, oh well, this is how we should do it. This is the way that that things should work. This is the way that the &gt;&gt; the the nation should govern itself. This is the way that politics should work. This is the way that &gt;&gt; each of these different pieces &gt;&gt; should be operating. &gt;&gt; And you know, when we look at these modern systems, I just took a a little while and was just I didn't go necessarily super super in-depth on any of these, but just started to to look into them a little bit. So when we look at communism, communism gives you the promise to have a utopia without God. It offers a a classless stateless society and a collective ownership of resources, equality, and elimination of exploitation. All that sounds pretty good. &gt;&gt; When we go through and you're just looking at, yeah, this is maybe this isn't so bad. Maybe this is all right. But yet what they leave out is the sin nature &gt;&gt; that is in humanity. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 3 verse 10 says as it is written there is none righteous know not one. And dropping down to verse 23 in the same chapter it says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. When you take the idea of communism and you add in that sin nature, you begin to see coming out, tyranny and fear and stagnation, all the things that people look at communism and go, "Well, this is bad. The communist nations never succeed. They fall apart. This that or the other." And it always goes back to the sin nature is where the problem comes from. &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the oneness of unity, he says, "Today all the towers of Babel, they may be built. all of the rockets they may find, all of the socialism and communism that they may stir up, all of the ecclesiastical systems will fail. But in spite of all of it, God will have a church united under his king, under his kingship by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; When we look at &gt;&gt; socialism, which &gt;&gt; seems to be the the thing that maybe is swinging a little more into our nation right now, that people are starting to go, "Oh, it's a a little more attractive. Maybe this is the direction that we want to go." &gt;&gt; Yeah. socialism. It promises governments or collective control of key industries, a redistribution of wealth for social equity, universal access to health care, education and welfare, a forced equality distribution without having without having heart changes. 2 Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 7 says, "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly or of necessity. For God loveth a cheerful giver." &gt;&gt; With socialism, that cheerful giver idea is thrown out because it's now being forced that okay, you have to give this much and you have to do this much and you have to do that. Right? &gt;&gt; And you begin to run into the results of dependency and inefficiency and control being taken into these different things. &gt;&gt; You begin to find a mindset that, well, why should I work harder to try to give someone else more and I can just do the bare minimum because I'm still getting what I'm supposed to get. &gt;&gt; True. Instead of thinking about because there's no thought of, oh well, I should be this generous because I have extra. It's well, the government handles it all. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don't need to do anything. &gt;&gt; So, I only want to do just enough for me because the government takes the rest. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; And then we go into capitalism, which is going to be the part that the US is built on. This is and when we talk about capitalism, there are lots of good things that we'll talk about and go, "Oh, well, this is the way our this is why our nation has succeeded because capitalism is so wonderful. It's such a a great system for everything." Capitalism promises freedom without restraint, free markets and private ownership, competition that drives innovation, individual freedom and limited government. But yet, when we begin to mix in the fallen state of man, once again, the system looks great. The system itself, all the things it promises are wonderful. &gt;&gt; They're all good. But now we mix into the fallen state of man, and we begin to see exploitation and greed and inequality. That's all mixing in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse 10 says, "For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have aired for the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." Brother Brandham says in the sermon, the serpent seed, he said, "No wonder the great lords of England said democracy was all sails and no anchor." That's right. Stand on a soapbox electioneering. The democracy is rotten and so is dictators and all the rest of it. The whole thing is rotten. There ain't but one thing for God to do is destroy the whole thing as he said he would do and start a new. Every system fails because its goals are wrong or not because its goals are wrong but because Christ is missing. &gt;&gt; Communism falls when man tries to make himself God. &gt;&gt; Good point. &gt;&gt; Socialism falls when they make government God. &gt;&gt; Okay. and commun and capitalism falls when money becomes God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All of the systems may have good things and bad things about them. You know, there are people even now, you'll begin to hear those that say that, well, Christ was a socialist. I mean, the first church, they lived with everything in common for one another. Okay, &gt;&gt; we can make that argument. Sure. &gt;&gt; But you also had the piece where Christ was at the center of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you place Christ at the center, then the system has an opportunity to succeed. &gt;&gt; But when you take the system and try to set it off by itself going, we don't need Christ. We can do it with this because this system is good enough. We can build our tower and we can escape the judgment of God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we can go out and we can be like all the other nations. We can have a king. We can do this. We can do that. &gt;&gt; They try to take out Christ. And at that point, all the systems will fail. &gt;&gt; You can make the arguments to go, "Oh, well, capitalism is the best of it." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Okay. In some ways, it is. I'm I'll be the first one to say I'm happy to be in a capitalist society. &gt;&gt; I am not I'm not here going, "Oh, we have to change the way the system works." &gt;&gt; There are many be benefits that come from it. But I am also one that's really quick to point out there's a lot of greed that goes along with this kind of system because you're still dealing with the fallenness of man. You're still dealing with a heart that is wicked. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The only reason any of these could work is if you were to put Christ at the center. If you take capitalism and have Christ at the center, well, suddenly you have and we see that there even I've met a few, but I have met a few brothers in the message that they are very wealthy, but they are also very generous and very quick to give to missions or give to churches or help with these different things. They are not sitting there going, "Oh, I just want more, more, more, more, more." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which is where you see the negative of capitalism. When you take out the Christ, we have so many people that and so many businesses that the only reason they will give is for the tax breaks. &gt;&gt; Okay, I have to give up this much so that I can write off my taxes. I have to give this much because that's the way the tax code works. You can go into like we talked about socialism. Yes, the first church had everything in common. They were working to take care of the widows, to take care of those that were struggling, those were that were dealing with different things. They were paying for doctor's bills or paying for this or doing that to take care of their brothers and sisters &gt;&gt; because they also still had Christ at the center. And so they knew, okay, I'm supposed to be providing for my family. I'm supposed to be taking care of those around me. They didn't have the mindset of,"Well, I'm just going to do the bare minimum because then I know that Brother Michael and Brother Colby with their business, they'll take care of my extra needs. So, I can just just do just enough and I'll trust them for my extra." They were there doing what they could &gt;&gt; to love those and care for those around them &gt;&gt; because Christ was at the center &gt;&gt; because they had a heart for serving God and serving their brothers and sisters. That's right. &gt;&gt; In the sermon perseverant, brothers, brother Brandham says, and that brings me to a thought of this. That's the reason tonight that our systems has failed. That's the reason that we will never be able to educate people to God. We'll never be able to denominate them to God. We've tried all these systems and they all fail. like fell like the tower of babel and they will always do that. Yes, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says in the sermon the uncertain sound. He says I believe democracy certainly I'm an American and I believe in democracy and but oh my at the rotten things that's into democracy. That's it. So it shows that all these man-made earthly ideas has to give way to a kingdom that's coming. I've had the privilege of standing on the grounds in Egypt where the pharaohs stood and murdered the people where the gladiators and so forth. You dig 20 feet under the earth to get to their kingdom where it set. I've stood where the pharaohs stood. I've stayed where where the great coliseum and the different places in Rome and and their kingdoms is fallen. Instead of just looking out here to see them, you have to dig down to find the ruins of them. Show that every man-made kingdom, every man-made system has to give way. &gt;&gt; So, you see, I don't care what kind of democracy, how many UNs we build, how many league of nations or anything we got to, it's all decaying. And oh my, there's just 10 tenel a person wrought on every wrote on every nation, every wall, everywhere, every democracy, every kingdom, everywhere else is failing. Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting. Kingdoms has kings has failed and dictators has failed, democracy has failed, churches has failed, humans beings has failed, everything has failed. You say churches, yes sir. Matthew chapter 7 and verse 24 says, "Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. When Jesus tells this parable, he only makes one distinction between the houses. The only distinction is what kind of foundation. He doesn't say that, well, that one was had shoddy craftsmanship or that one used poor quality materials or the builder wasn't experience as experienced with this one. &gt;&gt; Basically, he's saying they were the exact same exact same floor plan, exact same materials, exact same builder, &gt;&gt; exact same everything. They had the same system in place. The only thing that was different was what the system was built upon was that foundation. That was the only thing that was different. One foundation could support it, could give it the strength that it required to be able to weather the storms and weather the the tests that came along. And the other one couldn't. And so one house stood and one house fell. That's it. &gt;&gt; It's not the system that you can make all the arguments about which system is better or which this is better, but the real question comes down to what's the foundation. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; What's actually at the center of what you're talking about? &gt;&gt; There isn't a man-made system that is the answer. Come on. &gt;&gt; There is no man-made system that is going to provide every solution or provide every answer for the questions that come along. &gt;&gt; And yet, as we look at society and as we talk [clears throat] with different people in the workplace or even when we're talking with our brothers and sisters, we'll start to get wrapped up in the systems. We'll get wrapped up talking about the peace that's actually not as important. Romans chapter 12 and verse two says, "And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." In the sermon divine healing in 54, brother Brandham says, "One of the biggest failures in the world is the church." That's right. Churches has miserably failed. Everything has failed, but we receive a kingdom which will not fail. Jesus Christ. It cannot fail. And we're so happy for that that it's not a church affair affair. It's an individual affair. It's not whether my church is saved. It's whether I am saved. It isn't whether my deacon is saved or my pastor is saved or my mother is saved. It's whether I'm saved or not. Myself, I must be saved. Then I must tell them. And if they're saved, wonderful. If they're not, I must still remain saved. That's I must obtain my salvation. Oh, wonder. What a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; Christ is the missing piece that holds everything together. That's it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we can go into these long discussions about world systems or national systems or anything like that, but then you can also bring it down into the personal. &gt;&gt; Christ is the one who keeps our marriages together. &gt;&gt; In 2024, 35 to 40% of marriages in the US will result in divorce. One in 10 people in the United States battles with depression. Depression is the primary reason that every 12 minutes someone dies of suicide in the United States, resulting in over 41,000 deaths per year. Christ is who gives us overcoming power. The power to overcome temptations or trials or tests. When we try to build our lives around something else, when we try to build our lives using a different personal system, it's going to crumble. It's going &gt;&gt; to fall. &gt;&gt; We can go through the different personal system that you have. They may not have the fancy names like communism or socialism or capitalism, but you can go through to go, "Oh, well, I make sure to I have this very strict regimen that I follow that I get up at this time every day and I do this kind of workout and I do I only eat these kinds of foods and do this, that, or the other, whatever it might be." And then you've got the person that's two doors down that they have nothing like that. They eat whatever they want. They barely ever exercise. They do all these kind of other things and yet sometimes they'll outlive the one that was supposedly being healthy the whole way through &gt;&gt; and they'll go through and sometimes even during their life, not just they'll live longer, they'll be healthier even though they're eating junk and not exercising and doing whatever just somehow they have the genetics and they do great through life while the person who's doing all the stuff is continually suffering with different issues. issues and ailments and sicknesses and this that or the other. &gt;&gt; The system isn't solving the problem. The system isn't fixing anything. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that you shouldn't try to be healthy. I'm not saying that you shouldn't try to exercise or try to do these different things. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't save you. That doesn't &gt;&gt; that doesn't even prolong your life. &gt;&gt; The scripture said that your days were numbered from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Whether I exercise or not doesn't change how long I'm going to be here. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Because from the moment I was born, God was this is when he's born. This is when he'll die. &gt;&gt; This is when he'll fall asleep. This is when it's going to happen. There's nothing that I'm doing in my life that will prolong it, that will make my time on earth any more or any less than what God said it would be. 1 John chapter 5 and verse 4 says, "For whatsoever is born of God overcomemeth the world, and this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcomemeth the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God?" Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13, I can do all things through Christ which strengthenth me. We don't we don't come into life and think that we're able to build our own system or do our own things that's going to change anything. There's nothing man-made that is going to make my life longer, that's going to truly make my life more enjoyable. &gt;&gt; I may think for a few moments that this man-made thing is making my life more enjoyable. I will be the first one to say, and I've said this before, if my AC goes out, I want to get it fixed right away. This is a man-made enjoyment that I quite want. I do not want to deal with not having my air conditioning during the hot Oklahoma summer. I do not want to see my wife in the hot Oklahoma summer without air conditioning. These are not things that I want to experience. But at the same time, we don't have to go very far back in history. And people lived through the hot Oklahoma summer without air conditioning. And because they didn't know any different, it didn't really matter to them that much. I'm sure they complained about the heat. You know, they'd go down to the general store. Boy, it's sure a hot one today. It's really a scorcher, isn't it? But they weren't there. They weren't sitting there going, I am absolutely so miserable. There is no way I can survive this. This is not No, because this was just normal every day. This is what we deal with. &gt;&gt; So in one way, I can go my life is better and more enjoyable because of air conditioning. &gt;&gt; But is it? Or is it just that now I'm weaker because of air conditioning? &gt;&gt; Is it actually would my life truly be less enjoyable if air conditioning had not been created? [laughter] And yes, there are some that are already nodding and going, "Yes, my life would be worse." But at the same time, if you had never experienced it, if you didn't know what you were missing, &gt;&gt; if this is just what you were used to, &gt;&gt; would you even think about it? Really? &gt;&gt; It would just be part of life. I remember my mom talking about growing up in Miami, Florida, and she grew up without air conditioning. And she talked about the hot, muggy summer months and having the windows open, trying to get a breeze, trying to do whatever. But at the same time, she didn't talk about it like it was the absolutely most awful thing she'd ever experienced because she didn't have air conditioning. She'd never experienced it at that point. &gt;&gt; She didn't know what it was. It just her family had never been rich enough. She didn't have friends who were rich enough. She didn't experience air conditioning. Now, my mom would not give up her air conditioning. As I was growing up, my mom had been around air conditioning long enough. She wouldn't give it up. She wasn't sitting there wishing she could go back to what she had. But growing up without it, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; it didn't necessarily make this system that she didn't know about wasn't making her suffer cuz she didn't know it was there. There's no man-made system that is suddenly making everything amazing on its own. We can spend all of our time focused on it. And yes, I can have just as much fun as anyone talking politics and talking about the way the world's going or talking about this, that, or the other. And do you think that this law should be passed? Do you think that this one shouldn't? Do you think that this person had this authority to do this? Or do you think that whatever the debate is, whether you're a person that enjoys politics or not, you can get wrapped up into it, you can spend all your time on it, but the system itself and being wrapped up in we can even go into Republican or Democrat, &gt;&gt; well, they're both crooks, &gt;&gt; so it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter which one it is. If Christ isn't at their center, they're both equally corrupt &gt;&gt; because they're both still being run by fallen man. &gt;&gt; And yes, we can get wrapped up in that and we can get busy in our conversations talking about it. But then we can also get distracted and are there places in our lives where we're not making sure that Christ is at the center of our life? &gt;&gt; Are there places where we've allowed that system of some kind to be in place &gt;&gt; and go, "Okay, well that area is kind of just running itself. so far it's okay. So, I don't really need Christ to step in and handle that. It's like we talk about having that that locked room that you're like, "Okay, Christ, you you can come into this much of the house. That room's still locked. I don't I don't want you to go in there. I don't want you to deal with that part of my life. I don't want you to to face this. I'm not ready for you to go in there. It's fun when we can have the conversations on the grand scale and we're comparing capitalism and communism or we're talking about those things that in a lot of ways we're sitting here and we're talking we're going this doesn't affect me in the slightest. I live in a capitalist country. Even if I were standing here going, I think we should all be communists, me saying that is not going to affect a whole lot in Pawnie, Oklahoma. &gt;&gt; People might look at me weird. People might call me names. People might do whatever, but it's not actually going to change a whole lot right here. probably not. Even if I was outspoken about it for my entire life, probably still won't change a whole lot right here. And so we can have these grand debates about, well, what if America was socialist or communist or whatever? And we can get so busy on that and get so busy on the grand scale. Well, you know, these countries would do so much better if they switched to a capitalist society instead of this or if they did this instead of that. And we get wrapped up and distracted in these larger concerns instead of paying attention to what is actually important. &gt;&gt; Come on. Are we placing Christ fully at the center of our lives? Is Christ fully in control of my life? Is he actually the actual foundation that I'm built on? Or have I been busy building systems to to keep things running? Have I been building systems to somehow make it through life to well, I know all the right terminology. I can I can speak the message. I can &gt;&gt; speak the scriptures. I can put on a good front. I can wear the right kind of clothes. I can wear the right kind of fancy socks. Boys on the front row. I can tie the right kind of tie knots or I can do this or do that. I can have the the right kind of pin on my lapel. I can do all the right things. I have all the right systems in place. But is it actually built on the right foundation? Have I actually made sure that Christ is at the center, that he is the foundation of everything, or am I just building systems that are going to fall apart? I know this isn't a &gt;&gt; a shouting happy type service. This is just one introspection. Think about it for a minute and examine is everything where it should be. &gt;&gt; You know, it's really easy to to preach here at home and preach to, hey, these are all brothers and sisters that I know and everything that I can see from my viewpoint. They're all They're all believers. They're all living the way they should. They all do this. They all wear the right kind of ties, right kind of clothes. They've got the right kind of hair. They've got the They've checked off all the boxes. They can They can speak the message. They can speak the scriptures. They can do all the things. &gt;&gt; I'm not a prophet that can look into the heart. I'm not. That's not what I do. That's not me. And so I can't sit here and go, "Oh, well, I know that brother's struggling or that sister's struggling or they're dealing with this or they're dealing with that." All I see is the outside. It's like, "Oh, they're doing good. Everybody's in the right place. All All the systems are solid. But you have to answer those questions on your own. You have to examine your own life to okay, is the foundation what it should be? &gt;&gt; All right. I know brother Michael and sister Amy were dealing with a rental house where they had to deal with foundation issues and it took a while for y'all to get that leveled out and straightened and do all the stuff that had to be dealt with there. And they couldn't work on anything else in the house. They couldn't fix anything else until the foundation was dealt with. Now, if I had walked into the house [snorts] before anything was fixed, I wouldn't have even thought, "Oh, I can tell this house needs foundation work." I would have probably been looking going, "Okay, so it needs painting. It needs new trim, new cabinets, new appliances, new new whatever. But yet, if I had gone through and I had owned the house and I had fixed all those things without addressing the foundation, it might not happen immediately, but over time all those wonderful repairs that I would have done would have been undone. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Over time, all the great things that I had done to make the house look so good, make it so comfortable and so livable and make sure that it looked just right. I had the, you know, the fashionable color on my front door and I had the the best looking cabinets or this that or the other. And yet all of that would have started to fall apart at some point. Might not have been a couple weeks, might not have been a couple months. It might not have even been within the first year, but eventually the foundation issues would have begun to show themselves. And as we sit on a message pew, as we sit in a message church, we can have all &gt;&gt; the right trimmings. We've &gt;&gt; we've gone through and we've made sure that we've got the most fashionable cabinets and we've got the best front door and we've got the newest AC and we've got all these different things and we are looking on point. But I know too many people over the years that I would have looked at and I did look at and go, "Oh, they are solid. I know that they're believers." And yet I can now point to far more than I even want to think about that are now out doing who knows what &gt;&gt; because their foundation wasn't what it should have been. &gt;&gt; They had built all the systems. They had done all the different things. They they had everything looking right. They had it all together. &gt;&gt; And it might not have been one year. It might not have been five years. It might not have been 10 years. But eventually problems in the foundation came through. And we can sit here on the message pews and we can look the part. We can act the part. We can do all the things we're supposed to. And especially for the young men and young women that they're still under their parents' headship, they're still under their parents token. It's real easy to look the part and act the part because you know that if you don't, you're going to get grounded by your parents and you're going to deal with whatever types of punishments and so you're doing all the things. You're saying all the things. You're going through all the pieces you're supposed to. But eventually one day you come out from under that token. You come out from under that headship. And then it depends on what the foundation is. &gt;&gt; Christ is the missing piece, the missing foundation for &gt;&gt; for every one of these things. Whether we're talking about the grand national level, which system is best for a country to govern itself &gt;&gt; or whether we're talking about as a person, what am I building my own life on? what's going to hold me as I go through the storms, as I go through the trials, as I go through the temptations. You know that the houses that were that Christ talked about, the house that was built on the rock when the storm came through, it may have lost a couple shutters. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm from Florida with hurricanes. Storms come through, you might lose some shingles. You might lose some shutters. You might lose Who knows what kind of stuff? But if you had a good foundation and the house was built well, the house would stand. You might lose some of the fancy trim stuff. You might lose some of the excess pieces, which would be like, "All right, I'm going to have to fix a few things." But overall, the house is fine. &gt;&gt; Overall, the house is solid. I just now I get to rethink. Did I really need that kind of trim there? Should I have really had those kind of fake shutters on the outside of the house? Was that really important? &gt;&gt; Does it really matter? But yet the other house, it lost a whole lot more than some shingles or some shutters. It lost a whole lot more than just the fancy trim that was on the outside to to make the house look good. &gt;&gt; The whole house came down. And I'm not going to say that as we go through the storms of life that you might not lose a little bit of the trim. As you're facing these trials, as you're going through the struggles, you might have to fix a shingle or two in your life. You might need to deal with this issue or that issue. Maybe the rain gutter got torn off or this that or the other. or whatever it might be. But if the foundation is right, you're still going to be standing. &gt;&gt; You're still going to be there because you were standing on the rock from the beginning. And you may have lost some of the stuff that really didn't matter. You may have lost some of the things that weren't important, but you're still there. And we can talk to elders that have gone through life. We can talk to sister Jerene and brother Steve, sister Karen or brother Ken, brother Torrance. They've gone through the storms and they can probably admit that there were some things that came off that weren't that important. But yet at the end of the storm, at the end of the trial, they were still standing because they were on the right foundation. &gt;&gt; You have to make sure that your life is built with Christ at the center. You have to make sure that what you're trying to do, what you're trying to pursue, what you're valuing is placing Christ at the center because we can go through the debates of, hey, should you go to college to get a degree? Should you go to technical school to learn a trade? Should you do this or do that? What's going to be the right choice for you as you're providing a family? I've had plenty of these conversations with my oldest. This is the time of life we're in. And while those discussions are important, I'm not saying that you shouldn't have those conversations. But before those conversations, the first one is, are you where you should be with the Lord? &gt;&gt; That the rest of that doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; If you're not solid in relationship with Christ, then forget about the school stuff. &gt;&gt; We're not even going to touch that yet because it doesn't matter. Because you could go out and become the most successful electrician or the most successful plumber, the most successful IT person or the most successful HR person or banker, whatever. You could be the most successful in your trade and you're making all the money and you're doing all the things and life looks really, really good. But if Christ isn't at the center, if that foundation's not where it should be, it's going to manifest. &gt;&gt; It's going to show. You can watch those cracks on the national level as you see different nations falling apart when they think they had the system that fixed everything. And yes, we can talk about capitalism in the US and the debt that just keeps building and building and building and the different things that keep happening that show you that capitalism itself is not the solution. You can look at the communist nations, you can look at the socialist nations, you can look at fascist, Nazi, take your pick. Doesn't matter. They're still all man-made systems and they still all fail over time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing in our lives. If we're so focused on building our own man-made systems, if we're focused on I have to be able to talk right, I have to be able to look right. I have to be able to do this and do that. But yet we don't have Christ at the center. It's going to fail &gt;&gt; and it's going to fall apart &gt;&gt; as the musicians will come. Psalm 127 and verse one says, "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in fame in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. We can be so wrapped up in the trim of life. We can be so wrapped up in our own system. And maybe you're not a person that likes following politics, but you like following this or you like following that or you like paying attention to this subject or that subject. All of us have some sort of interests and we'll get wrapped up and focused on these different things. But if our center isn't built on Christ, if our center isn't built on the rock, then the storms of life will knock us down. Maybe you'll get through one storm. Wasn't what that that wasn't a very bad one. Maybe you'll get through a couple storms. That's like I said, I've seen people over the years that they were in church. I grew up with them. They were there. They were at the youth camps. They were [music] at the altar praying. They were doing all the things. They got married and they're living the life. They're they're looking like they're supposed to. They're acting like they're supposed to. Like I said, I'm not a prophet. But I couldn't look ahead in time and go, "Oh, they're going to fall. It's coming." To me, they were just the brother that I grew up with that I'd known for years, that we'd been in church together for years or whatever it might be. And then eventually the foundation failed and and they were gone. It's one of those things that reminds you that Satan doesn't respect [music] whether you're a kid, whether you're an adult, whether you're married, whether you're not, whether you have kids, whether you don't. He's coming after you. Whatever stage of life you're in, whatever you're dealing with, whatever you're going through, and if the foundation's not solid, he's going to take you down. It's one of the reasons that we know brother Wendell and the different ministers will talk to the youth so much about you have to get the Holy Spirit. You have to be filled with the Holy Spirit. You have to be sealed. &gt;&gt; You have to have the seal that shows everything's packed just right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That foundation's stable. It's solid. It's where it's supposed to be. And if the foundation is stable, you know what? Maybe the system I've built around that foundation is struggling a little bit. Maybe my man-made system isn't working. But yet, if I'm on the right foundation, if I've got Christ living inside me, he'll start fixing that system and he'll start replacing it to where, wait, now I'm no longer working with a man-made system because now God's starting to build the system around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ at [music] the center. Christ is our foundation. And that's what carries us through the storms. That's what carries us through every struggle, every trial. That's what carries us through when we sit there feeling like we're failures. It's what carries us through when we end up at the altar crying out to God because we've messed up. because we made a bad decision or we chose to go out and go against what we knew to be right. But God's mercy keeps bringing [music] us back &gt;&gt; because that foundation because there's Christ at the center there. He's going to keep working on us. God's in the business of working with broken humanity and reforming us and making us into something beautiful. My son a few months back got one of those he got a kit where he could try the the Japanese art form of breaking [music] pottery and then using gold or silver epoxy to put it back together. And you end up with this piece of pottery that now has these streaks of gold or silver or whatever kind of metallic [music] he chooses to use. And obviously I can look at the pottery and I can tell it was broken at some point. I don't look at it and go, "Oh, this is undamaged. It's never had anything happen to it. But yet when you look at the pottery, even though you can see that it was broken, even though you can see the damage that was done to it, you now look at it and go, "Oh, wow. This is a work of art. It's more beautiful than it was before. Those cracks now highlight the skill of the craftsman that put it back together. And God working on our lives. He doesn't. We can still look at each other and know that we're still human. We still make mistakes. We still have past. We still have history. And as long as we're in the flesh, we're we can't forget it like God does. God puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness. And I can now stand before him as though I never did it. But while I'm still in this flesh, it's not the way my mind works. I can't forget it the same way. I can't. And I think this is part of the human condition. If you're someone in here that can completely forget it, God bless you. I'm glad you can do that. But yet now I can look at it and I can There was a brother [music] that I was in church when I was growing up that he was older. He was more closer to my dad's age. I've mentioned him here years ago. His name was Robert Schmur. He went by brother Bob. And he was the kindest, nicest guy. He was the most faithful in coming to church. He was always there. If he knew that my dad had to do some type of work on our house or was doing some sort of repair, Brother Bob was there to help out. We replaced shingles on our mobile home to patch it multiple times. And Brother Bob came and he taught myself and my brother how to replace shingles and he taught us how to do this or how to do that. Cuz at that time, my dad was not climbing on a ladder to get on the roof. That that was no longer allowed. He was not He was too old for that. Wasn't happening. After my dad passed away and my family moved to Sarasota, Brother Bob was went to that same church and he was still there all the time. He taught me how to drive a stick shift. And he was a big influence on me. Brother Bob Schmur had done hard time in prison. He had been involved in robberies. He had carried a gun, though he never used it. He had when he had first gone to jail, he had found out who was the toughest guy in the prison. And his first day on the work detail with him, he had jumped the guy and attacked him and gotten himself the reputation is the the crazy guy in prison so everybody would leave him alone. I found out his story over the years. I had trouble believing it. I had trouble believing that that was even possible for this gentle, loving man to have ever been in that kind of situation. He never forgot his past, I'm sure. And he was quite willing to to share his past, to talk about it, to talk about the grace and mercy of God. And I could look at his life and I could see the touch of the master's hand and I could see those broken places that were now gold and that now just made his life even more valuable and more beautiful than it was before. And there are brothers and sisters in this church that they've had those struggles. They've been through the hard things. They've done things that they're willing to talk about, but they're not proud of that are in their past. But yet now you can talk to them. You can spend time with them. And being one of the still one of the newer people that's here for a lot of them I can look at him and go I have a hard time believing that that was ever a reality in your life. I have a hard time believing that you were ever that man or that woman. But now I can look at their lives and I can see the beauty that God's put in there with his mercy and his grace. putting them back together and creating this masterpiece that now stands there where Satan would say, "Oh, you're too broken. Oh, you could never come back from this. Oh, you're too far gone." But Christ still stands there going, "No, I can put you back together." Brother Kobe talked about the mercy of God this morning. in that mercy of God and Christ as your foundation. That's what [music] holds us. That's what keeps us going through every struggle that we have. We don't stand here trying to say that we're perfect. At least I don't. I don't try to say that I've got it all figured out. I've got it all right. That my life is now above reproach. I make far more mistakes than I would probably ever want to admit. &gt;&gt; But by God's grace, I'm still standing. [music] By God's grace, I'm still here as I've watched friends and people that I knew drop off. And each one of us that are here can say the same thing. By God's grace, I'm still here. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I've weathered the storms that have come through. By God's grace, I'm built on the right foundation. That's the checkup that we have to do in our lives time and time again. Am I on the foundation like I'm supposed to? Is Christ at the center? Is he the most important part of my life? Lord, just do a checkup. Is there something that I need to deal with? [music] Is there something that I need to face? Is there something that I need correction on? Is there something that I need encouragement? Whatever it might be, Lord, I want to surrender to you. Lord, I don't want to be so focused on the system that's on the outside. I don't want to be so focused on the shutters or the color of the door. Lord, are you at the center? Are you the most important part of my life? Are you the foundation that I'm building everything on? is Lord, I need to be able to stand. Let's all bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we come before you. And Lord, for myself, I Lord, I want to know that I'm right. Lord, I want to know that I'm right for my own salvation. Lord, I I want to know that I'm right so that I can be a a role model for my children. Lord, so that I can be a a leader for my wife. So that I can be a witness, an example to those that I work with or those that I encounter or spend time with. Lord, we thank you for your mercy in our lives. Lord, we we thank you for the grace that you rain down upon us time and time again, giving us what we don't deserve. Lord, help us to examine our lives. Lord, help us to look past uh all the outer trim and all the outer extras, Lord. And Lord, help us to examine the foundation that we're on. Lord, if we're not fully on the solid rock, Lord, then Lord, help to move us where we should be. Lord, help us to build our lives completely on you and to trust completely in you, Lord. We thank you for everything that you do for us, Lord. We thank you for your many blessings, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we just surrender to you aresh Lord I see helping me faithfully. [singing] overcome my trials. He's guided me constantly, [singing and music] &gt;&gt; giving me victory. &gt;&gt; He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. [singing] Something keeps [music] holding me every day. [singing] I see.

Something [singing and music] keeps holding me. Every day I [singing and music] see. Helping me faithfully to overcome [singing and music] my trials. guiding me constantly, [music and singing] giving me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps holding [singing] me. [music] Child, &gt;&gt; getting [singing] closer. Oh, the pull I felt was more than [singing] I could bear. And I was on [singing] the verge of giving [music] over. The strength within myself just wasn't [music and singing] there. But something keeps haunting me. Every day I see [singing] he's helping me faithfully to overcome [music] my [singing] trials, guiding me constantly, [music] giving [singing] me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps [singing and music] holding me. Let's keep our pastor in prayer. He'll be flying home [music] tomorrow, right, Sister Fresca? Keep him in prayer as he travels home. That is a long flight. I'm sure he'll be just a little bit tired when he gets back. This was a quick trip. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He flew out, was preaching for 3 days, and then flies right back. Um, [music] so keep him in your prayers that help maybe sleep on the plane, get some rest. Keep keep all those in our prayers that we know that are dealing with their different medical issues [music] and struggles in the body. Brother Donald and uh Sister Angie that aren't here, keep them in your prayers. Uh brother Duran, keep him in your prayers. How much longer are they planning on keeping him? He gets out Thursday. Okay. Keep keep brother Dur in your prayers. [music] Um remember uh keep remembering Luke. He's got [music] uh an appointment on Thursday with uh the doctor where they'll talk about what the next procedure will be. Um as he's dealing with kidney stones and different things. um they have already told us that it is not common for a 16-year-old [music] to have this many kidney stones. So, um they're going to be doing different tests and things to figure out what is the cause and what needs to be dealt with so that he's not dealing with these more. Um I feel really bad for him while at the same time being really thankful that I've never dealt with them. uh you know, it's it's more to be expected when you're getting towards [music] towards my age that maybe this would start happening. It's not expected for a 16-year-old. So, um [music] keep him in your prayers and all the other brothers [music] and sisters that are dealing with different things. Mr. Carol, &gt;&gt; you have an appointment with the surgeon on Thursday. [music] There's a lot happening on Thursday, so maybe take a little extra time Thursday morning. Remember these different requests and everything. Um, and you know, just like with with everything, we're trusting in the Lord for for every step of the journey, every trial that comes along. I was talking with Luke about it. I was like, I don't know why God would have this in the plans for you at 16, [music] but he's got a purpose and he's got a reason. And maybe it's just to get you to trust him a little more. I once again, I'm not a prophet. [music] I don't know. But we know that God lets us go these through every one of these for a reason. And we just trust him to bring us through each [music] step of the way. So, we'll let you all dismiss yourselves, greet one another as you go, keep one another in prayer, and if the Lord carries, we'll see y'all on Wednesday. Lord bless you. God meantly, [singing and music] giving me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan lay before me his temptation [music and singing] his desire to steal away [singing and music] my faith. But I found in time the revelation, the strength I need to keep me [music and singing] in his grace.
