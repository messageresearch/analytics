[15:13] As they continue to play that softly
[15:16] now, like to go to prayer, ask brother
[15:19] Joe, would you mind coming and leading
[15:21] us in prayer? We we have a request from
[15:24] Sister Carol. Says Amaya and Andrew both
[15:27] have earachches. So, let's remember them
[15:31] as in our prayers here tonight. And then
[15:33] a few requests was sent to dad. It says,
[15:37] um, "Brother Wendle, this is Kathy.
[15:39] Please keep Wallace in your prayer. Uh,
[15:42] this week, Tuesday, he has to go to the
[15:44] hospital there in Muscogee. He's going
[15:46] to have stance put in his heart." So,
[15:48] let's remember them. And also, one was
[15:50] sent here says, "Good afternoon,
[15:52] everyone. Could you all uh pray, please
[15:55] be in prayer for Sister Kim Weeks?"
[15:58] uh she's been um through some rough
[16:00] things in the past week or two.
[16:02] Originally, she went in because she had
[16:03] a uh a gallbladder issue, but they were
[16:07] going to so they were going to remove
[16:09] the stone and then take out the
[16:10] gallbladder, but I believe in the end
[16:13] they're just going to put in a stent and
[16:14] I'm going to see if she would pass uh
[16:18] pass that and do the gallbladder later.
[16:21] says, "Anyway, I believe they tore
[16:22] something
[16:24] uh when they were going to do the
[16:26] surgery. So, she has been having some
[16:29] severe severe pain due to that. Uh she
[16:32] was in the hospital for over a week and
[16:34] was not able to hardly even eat at all
[16:37] during this time to where now she's
[16:39] having a difficulty eating. Um, someone
[16:42] from the hospital called to check in on
[16:44] her today and after her explaining
[16:46] things, they told her they wanted her to
[16:48] come back immediately. So, let's
[16:50] remember Sister Kim Weekes in our
[16:53] prayers here tonight. That's um she goes
[16:56] to brother Sha's church. So, let's
[16:58] remember them in our prayers. And if you
[17:01] have any other needs upon your heart
[17:02] tonight, just make it known by the
[17:04] lifting of your hand. God bless you now.

[17:17] tonight.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thankful for the service this
[17:19] morning and
[17:20] &gt;&gt; for the service tonight.
[17:22] Let's go to the Lord. Lord, you see all
[17:26] the requests, Lord.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're you're able to meet all
[17:30] their needs, Father.
[17:33] Lord, I'm asking just just be with us
[17:35] all here tonight, Father. Open our
[17:38] hearts to the hearing of the word, Lord,
[17:40] and just come and speak to every one of
[17:41] us, Lord.
[17:43] Lord, we thank you for today. We thank

[17:55] &gt;&gt; If you love your tonight, can we do that
[17:58] song? It's who I am, Lord. It's who I
[18:00] am. I'm not sure the key of any glorious
[18:04] mystery.
[18:07] One day he set me free
[18:11] and made my heart
[18:16] his very throne.
[18:20] My life is no longer mine.
[18:24] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[18:28] And now I live
[18:32] to praise his name.

[34:57] Jesus,
[35:02] there's your something. Sing it now as
[35:05] the man of God comes
[35:08] that day.
[35:13] He's my master, my master,
[35:17] savior.
[35:20] Jesus.
[35:25] or like a fragrance
[35:29] after
[35:31] the rain.
[35:37] Oh Jesus,
[35:41] Jesus,
[35:43] Jesus.
[35:48] Let all heaven
[35:52] and earth
[35:54] proclaim.
[36:00] For kings
[36:03] and kingdoms
[36:06] will all
[36:08] pass away.
[36:11] But there's something
[36:14] about
[36:17] that name. Can we just lift a hand and
[36:20] sing it again? Oh Jesus.
[36:25] Oh Jesus.
[36:37] about
[36:40] that.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Oh master,
[36:49] savior
[36:52] Jesus
[36:56] like the freers
[37:00] after
[37:03] the rain.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; So Jesus.
[37:14] Oh Jesus.
[37:19] Let heaven
[37:23] and earth
[37:25] proclaim
[37:36] will all
[37:38] pass away.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; But there's something
[37:44] about
[37:48] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[37:52] And her son,
[37:56] &gt;&gt; oh God.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[38:03] And there's something
[38:07] about
[38:11] that name.
[38:16] Hallelujah.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; We honor your name.
[38:26] We honor you, Lord. We love you with all
[38:30] of our heart. Glory to God.
[38:35] We thank you, Jesus. We love you, Lord.
[38:40] We feel your presence here this evening,
[38:43] Lord.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Wanting your will in our lives,
[38:50] wanting your desires to be fulfilled
[38:53] through us, Lord.
[38:57] Oh, we thank you, Jesus. We thank you,
[39:01] Jesus.
[39:05] We love you, Lord.
[39:12] Your presence means everything to us.
[39:18] Oh God,
[39:23] we our greatest longing is to just be in
[39:26] your presence.
[39:29] Our greatest longing, Lord, is to know
[39:32] that you hear us.
[39:35] to know that we're pleasing to you,
[39:38] Lord.
[39:41] Speak your words to our hearts, Lord.
[39:45] Let our hearts, Lord, rejoice in your
[39:48] word,
[39:50] right now, Lord.
[39:53] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[39:57] Thank you, Jesus.
[40:01] And Lord, we just ask that you would
[40:02] speak your words to us tonight.
[40:06] Let your
[40:08] presence remain with us. Lord,
[40:12] let me not say anything, Lord,
[40:15] that wouldn't be of you.
[40:18] Let us not think anything that wouldn't
[40:21] be of you, Lord.
[40:25] We love you, Father.
[40:28] Thank you, Jesus.
[40:30] Thank you, Jesus.
[40:35] Praise the name of the Lord.
[40:40] He's so wonderful, isn't he?
[40:43] Just his presence is just so sweet right
[40:46] now.
[40:52] Glory to God. Glory to God.
[41:03] Hallelujah.
[41:08] If you have your Bibles, we'll look here
[41:10] in Luke the first chapter and
[41:14] the 31st verse.
[41:18] We are thankful to God. Brother
[41:20] Torrance, it's good to see you tonight.
[41:23] bless you. Been missing brother Torrance
[41:27] and um
[41:30] uh we sure do appreciate him.
[41:38] We want to look here at Luke 1 and 31
[41:48] and it says, "Behold, thou shalt
[41:50] conceive in thy womb
[41:55] and bring forth a son,
[41:58] and thou shalt call his name
[42:03] Jesus."
[42:04] 34th verse.
[42:07] Then Mary said unto the angel, "How
[42:11] shall this be, seeing that I know no not
[42:14] a man?"
[42:17] The 37th verse,
[42:20] for with God nothing is impossible.
[42:25] And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of
[42:29] the Lord.
[42:31] Be it unto me according to thy word."
[42:36] And the angel departed.
[42:40] Amen. We ask God's blessings upon his
[42:43] word. You can be seated here this
[42:45] evening.
[42:48] sort of going to finish up my thoughts
[42:51] as we have been thinking about
[42:55] last Sunday. The word was made flesh.
[43:01] The word was made flesh. It was
[43:05] great God Almighty. It was nothing none
[43:08] other than God himself.
[43:13] This morning we talked about
[43:17] that there was a portion
[43:21] of God that was left behind when Jesus
[43:25] raised from the dead. We understand the
[43:28] fullness of God's spirit was in him and
[43:31] it was male and female. When he left
[43:36] Amen he left that feminist part of him
[43:40] here on the earth. Amen. That's his
[43:44] spirit. And he's embodied a bride. And
[43:48] there in the book of Acts, we could see
[43:52] the many blessings that have come from
[43:54] that.
[43:56] And tonight, I'd like to just sort of
[43:57] finish up my thoughts if if I may.
[44:01] Amen.
[44:03] Being fruitful.
[44:05] We can God's God's design is to is for
[44:10] us to be fruitful
[44:12] &gt;&gt; and amen. So we can look at this child.
[44:16] We can ask we can answer the question,
[44:18] who is this mysterious child? He is the
[44:21] word made flesh. He it was God in a body
[44:28] that had so taken over this body.
[44:31] But yet Jesus would say, "My meat is to
[44:34] do the will of him. My father lives in
[44:37] me. He does the works."
[44:41] And then when we look here, as I say
[44:43] this morning, who is this mysterious
[44:45] woman? Amen. She is bone of his bone.
[44:49] She is flesh of his flesh.
[44:53] And
[44:54] the works of her husband is made
[44:57] manifest through her.
[45:00] and God and and and in the in the Bible
[45:04] days, Amen. the the woman always looked
[45:08] to the to the Lord to bless the fruit of
[45:12] her womb.
[45:14] And when a lady couldn't have children,
[45:18] amen, she felt that she had that God had
[45:22] closed up her womb, that she was not
[45:24] able to produce. And and it was
[45:27] considered a curse. It was a curse when
[45:30] a woman couldn't couldn't um have
[45:33] children
[45:35] &gt;&gt; because children were
[45:38] man it it it um it was it was the
[45:42] connection between two people becoming
[45:45] one
[45:47] &gt;&gt; and amen and so it would be the the
[45:51] legacy of the man going forward.
[45:56] So the fruit of the womb was very
[45:58] important to the woman and we understand
[46:01] we could see that in in Rachel and Leah.
[46:06] Rachel uh of course you know Jacob had
[46:09] had worked seven years uh for for for um
[46:15] Rachel and and then um um then he was
[46:19] deceived and had to work he got he got
[46:21] Leah. And so then he worked for another
[46:23] seven years for Laban and and and then
[46:26] and and then he was then he married he
[46:28] was given uh uh Rachel
[46:31] &gt;&gt; and um Leah could produce. Leah Leah was
[46:36] able to have children but Rachel was not
[46:40] able to have children.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And and so it was it was a it was a
[46:46] continual struggle. There's a continual
[46:49] battle. Amen. between the two because
[46:53] one wanted to and then but then uh one
[46:57] could have it and one could not,
[46:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; And through the agony and prayer, then
[47:02] God opened the womb of of Rachel.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; And and and Rachel
[47:10] uh gave Joseph or or gave Jacob a
[47:14] Joseph,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; gave Jacob a Benjamin. And and it was it
[47:20] was a sacred thing for God. It was a
[47:22] sacred thing for for them all. And it
[47:25] was a but it was so it being fruitful,
[47:30] being being able to produce is is is
[47:34] what God is want. So we could go we're
[47:36] not going to go through uh anything just
[47:38] real deep tonight. I've just got a few
[47:40] quotes I want to give you. But amen when
[47:43] we when we when brother Brandham would
[47:45] talk about Amen. the fruit and he would
[47:48] or he talk about the the the uh uh the
[47:51] bedding grounds and
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it it it was an important it
[47:57] was an important thing. Amen. It the
[48:01] fruitfulness of a woman was very
[48:04] important to the Jewish people and still
[48:06] is.
[48:08] And um so when Jesus would would tell
[48:12] his he would look at his disciples and
[48:15] he says as he's fixing to leave and he
[48:17] says you've not chosen me but I have
[48:21] chosen you and I've ordained you to go
[48:24] forth and bring forth fruit and that
[48:28] your fruit would remain.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he would he would say we're
[48:34] entering into a a different level. I'm
[48:37] not looking at you and talking to you as
[48:40] as as uh uh uh as servants, he said, but
[48:44] I'm talking to you on a higher level.
[48:47] Amen. And so it is today. God is talking
[48:50] to us on a higher level. He's talking to
[48:54] us as his bride. And and so as we as we
[48:59] uh uh look through some of these things
[49:01] here tonight, I I think that we should
[49:04] our thinking should be on a higher
[49:07] level.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Not not a not a girl, a schoolgirl
[49:11] level, but a but a matured bride level
[49:16] &gt;&gt; because God wants fruit.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; God wants Amen. a a a continuation of
[49:26] himself. Amen. And so and and as I say,
[49:30] when God would pronounce blessings o
[49:32] upon upon the different ones, he he
[49:35] would pronounce he would always go to
[49:37] the fruit of the womb. And I I want God
[49:40] to do that. I want God to look upon
[49:43] every one of you here tonight and say,
[49:45] "I will bless your womb."
[49:48] Not not not that we're thankful for our
[49:50] natural children, but I'm asking God to
[49:53] bless your spiritual children.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; I I I I want to bring forth spiritual
[49:59] fruit unto the Lord.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Psalms 128 and3, thy wife shall be
[50:04] fruit, a fruitful vine by the sides of
[50:07] thine house, and thy children like olive
[50:10] plants round about thy table. So when we
[50:14] when we look here at this mysterious
[50:17] woman, she's not necessarily
[50:21] she doesn't necessarily have
[50:25] a lot of flash to her.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. This woman that we talked about
[50:29] this morning, there's not just a whole
[50:31] lot of Amen. uh uh in our daytoday you
[50:35] you might not it's not going to be the
[50:37] big churches not going to have a lot of
[50:39] a lot of shows and a lot of things that
[50:41] that would go on. But this is a woman
[50:44] that understands that she is part of him
[50:49] in every way. She understands that she
[50:52] as she's just as much a mystery as he is
[50:55] a mystery. He is God in a body and she
[51:00] understands that she is God in a body.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; She's just the feminine part of God.
[51:07] Amen. And God's got a work here on the
[51:11] earth. And and so she she understands
[51:15] that she is the only one that can give
[51:18] birth to the word because God is not
[51:21] going to place his word in a harlot.
[51:26] HE'S NOT GOING TO PLACE HIS WORD OUT
[51:28] there on these floozies, these
[51:30] denominational
[51:31] &gt;&gt; flooies.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; He's only going to place his word in his
[51:37] bride.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; And she knows that.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; She understands that. Amen. She was
[51:43] eating before the foundation of the
[51:45] world. And and and and it will be
[51:48] through her and her alone that his word
[51:51] can be birthed through. So, SO THIS IS
[51:55] AN INCREDIBLE THING TO her because she
[51:59] understands not only that he is God, BUT
[52:04] SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT she is his bride.
[52:09] And it and it makes it gives a it it
[52:12] GIVES A A A responsibility
[52:15] really begins to settle down upon her
[52:19] &gt;&gt; that I am the one that will that will
[52:23] bring forth children.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; I am the one that is going to do this
[52:29] and it'll all be supernatural. So,
[52:32] brother Brandham, in this e in the god
[52:34] of this evil age, if you haven't
[52:35] listened to the god of this evil age in
[52:36] a while, that's a that that's a powerful
[52:40] message because while there's a lot of
[52:42] uh condemnation uh of the system and the
[52:46] harlot, he is also really really
[52:50] ministering to the bride. And in any of
[52:52] these messages that you listen to, but
[52:54] you you you've got to understand they're
[52:56] they're he's condemning the harlot, the
[52:59] denominational systems. Amen. For what
[53:02] they have done and the blessings that
[53:04] God's given them. And they've turned it
[53:06] out. They've spurned it. Amen. And taken
[53:08] on other seed, denominational seed,
[53:11] man-made ideas, dogmas. Mama said, daddy
[53:14] said, the pope said, the preacher said,
[53:17] AMEN. BUT THEN HE ALSO COMES TO THE
[53:19] BRIDE, HIS BRIDE, and he says, "Listen,
[53:23] there's something precious about you,
[53:24] and I want you to always pick that up in
[53:26] any of those messages that you that
[53:28] you're listening to. Always pick that
[53:30] up." Amen. Some people say, "Well, he's
[53:32] he's condemning me. It's just nothing
[53:34] but condemnation." And I listen to the
[53:36] same message and say, "I hear I hear
[53:39] nothing but but affirmation. I hear
[53:42] nothing but Amen. celebration. something
[53:45] telling me, "Listen, Amen. you you mean
[53:48] a lot to me." And and so in in the uh
[53:52] God of this evil age, he would say, "But
[53:54] in obedience," Amen. Now, he's just he
[53:57] just left him. He was pretty upset.
[53:59] God's God's God's uh uh uh pronounced
[54:02] judgment on the flooies. But now he's
[54:04] saying in obedience, this little faith
[54:07] woman
[54:09] lives by faith. the bride, the p this
[54:14] the person here and there and here and
[54:17] off somewhere else, some other church.
[54:20] Amen. Whatever it is, some see believes
[54:23] the word of God and is obedient and
[54:27] she's waiting in love FOR THE PROMISE OF
[54:31] THE age to be confirmed. Now, SHE'S HE'S
[54:36] GOT THIS HE'S GOT THIS BRIDE, THIS
[54:38] LITTLE FAITH WOMAN THAT IS NOT GOING TO
[54:41] ALLOW JUST anything into the womb of her
[54:45] heart. Amen. He says she believes the
[54:48] word and obedient, waiting in love for
[54:50] the promise of the age to be confirmed.
[54:52] She's watching for it. She's part of
[54:55] that word. She's watching for her life
[54:59] to manifest that word. Brethren, can't
[55:02] you see it? I hope that don't go over
[55:04] you. AMEN. THE BODY IS WAITING. THE BODY
[55:09] IS WAITING FOR which is the word.
[55:11] WAITING FOR THE LIFE WHICH is the spirit
[55:14] to confirm and make it alive. Now I I
[55:18] want you TO I WANT TO STOP THERE REAL
[55:19] QUICK BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
[55:21] YOU ARE PART bone of his bone, flesh of
[55:24] his flesh, word of his word. AMEN. THAT
[55:27] WORD YOU'RE A PART OF HIM.
[55:31] So that new creation in you, amen, IS IS
[55:35] THE WORD. YOU ARE A WORD BEING.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; So he's saying she is THE WORD. THIS
[55:41] BODY IS waiting for the spirit, the Holy
[55:45] Spirit, the life, THE GERM TO COME down
[55:49] to confirm and make IT ALIVE. THAT'S
[55:54] WHAT SHE'S WAITING FOR. No other life
[55:57] will work in her. She can't come to life
[56:00] any other way. YET SHE FEELS IT OUT
[56:03] THERE. SHE KNOWS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
[56:07] AMEN. And there it happens when then she
[56:09] wakes up and she says let and when God
[56:13] says let there be and then she came
[56:16] forth uh like the first one that would
[56:19] come forth. And what is WHAT WHAT WHAT
[56:21] HE'S saying is the word that IS SPOKEN
[56:25] BRINGS ABOUT ANOTHER CREATION. And
[56:28] that's what we are are wanting. But God
[56:31] is speaking that creation through us.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; We're giving birth to his word. We're
[56:37] giving birth to the supernatural. Well,
[56:40] praise the Lord.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE BEDDING GROUNDS. THE WOMB
[56:44] MUST BE pure and undefiled because we
[56:47] want to be fruitful.
[56:50] in the invisible union. HE SAID HER BODY
[56:52] IS GIVEN TO HER A SACRED TRUST from God.
[56:56] No female dog, no bird, no other animal,
[56:59] no other creature like that. NO, SHE'S
[57:02] THE ONLY ONE TALKING ABOUT the woman.
[57:04] AND THAT'S WHY THAT'S THE REASON it's so
[57:07] sacred. She is to bring forth life into
[57:11] the earth. HER BODY IS THE BEDDING
[57:14] grounds of life. Therefore, that's the
[57:18] reason she is given this sacred trust.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; The woman is given that. Amen. Now, he
[57:24] was saying it's not like any other kind
[57:25] of animal life. They don't have souls.
[57:28] So, they can't commit adultery.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. A dog can't commit adultery. Uh
[57:33] the animal LIFE CAN'T COMMIT ADULTERY.
[57:35] BUT A WOMAN IS GIVEN THAT THAT
[57:39] SACREDNESS because she is producing.
[57:43] Amen. uh she's bringing INTO THE WORLD
[57:46] THAT THAT which God had created in the
[57:49] beginning.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; The these men, these boys, girls have a
[57:55] SOUL AND THAT SOUL IS IMPORTANT. AND SHE
[57:59] MUST NOT DEFILE her womb. SHE MUST NOT
[58:03] THAT'S THE SACRED BEDDING GROUND between
[58:06] her and her husband.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the reason I say Amen.
[58:10] there that you you you you men fight
[58:13] that spirit that that would have you
[58:15] looking at other women. God's given you
[58:17] a woman and there's only one woman for
[58:19] you. And that woman should know that you
[58:22] that that she is your everything.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Should know. Boys, you
[58:28] should always do that. THIS IS A SACRED
[58:31] SACRED THING. AND I PROMISE YOU, the
[58:34] commitment that God is asking of you,
[58:36] he's also keeping that for himself.
[58:40] GOD'S NOT FOLLOWING the flooies out
[58:42] there and commit adultery against his
[58:43] bride.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He's going to bring it
[58:47] through his bride or it won't happen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it through his bride
[58:52] or it won't happen. Can you say amen?
[58:55] And so, Amen. He He So, it's a sacred
[59:00] thing. and and and in the power of
[59:02] transformation. And he's preaching this
[59:04] a lot of these he's he's preaching uh
[59:07] I'm quoting out a lot of these just
[59:08] before brother Brandham passes away and
[59:11] he's and he's and he's really driving
[59:12] these things home and and the power of
[59:14] transformation and this is 103165.
[59:17] Amen. HE SAYS WE ALSO FIND OUT THAT when
[59:20] he come in uh he deformed that seed. He
[59:25] corrupted that seed by getting into the
[59:27] bedding grounds which was Eve. So, so
[59:30] Satan come in, Amen. and polluted the
[59:33] bedding grounds. And now Eve produced a
[59:37] wild man. Now through adultery, she
[59:40] produced something that she wasn't
[59:42] created to produce.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; She was CREATED TO PRODUCE THE WORD.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; ADAM WAS TO SPEAK that word. She was to
[59:51] connect seed. Amen. H was to to to
[59:55] receive seed and to PRODUCE THE SEED.
[59:58] THAT'S WHAT THE WOMAN WAS FOR. To to
[1:00:02] reproduce the man.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE BRIDE IS FOR. To
[1:00:11] reproduce
[1:00:13] her lover, HER CHRIST, THE WORD.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's the reason why. Amen.
[1:00:21] That's the reason why when God TALKED TO
[1:00:23] THE OTHER WOMAN uh uh uh there in the in
[1:00:26] the church, there's three women uh in
[1:00:28] there in the book of Revelation. There
[1:00:30] is the the wise virgin, there's the
[1:00:32] foolish virgin, and then there is the
[1:00:34] adulterous woman.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE THE WISE virgin is is is going
[1:00:40] to receive seed. THE FOOLISH VIRGIN IS
[1:00:44] NOT GOING TO RECEIVE SEED.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; IT THE LIFE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO
[1:00:50] HER. Are you HEARING ME? THE WISE VIRGIN
[1:00:54] IS SAY, "I WANT TO receive your seed
[1:00:58] into my womb because I want to produce,"
[1:01:02] Amen. your your desires here on the
[1:01:04] earth.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. So he says he
[1:01:08] corrupted that seed uh by getting into
[1:01:10] the bedding grounds which was Eve and
[1:01:13] corrupted it and and corrupted the seed
[1:01:17] with a corruptible seed before it gets
[1:01:19] there. uh be before it it could get
[1:01:22] there Adam seed to corrupt the beautiful
[1:01:25] garden of Eden.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But then on on down in
[1:01:30] in the the power of transformation, he
[1:01:33] says, "But that seed will take a hold
[1:01:36] somewhere." Glory to God. The only thing
[1:01:39] he's looking for today is a bedding
[1:01:42] ground somewhere that it can bed. How
[1:01:47] how many wants to just say, "Lord, be it
[1:01:48] unto me. Be it unto me according to thy
[1:01:52] word." I I I I don't want that. I I I
[1:01:55] DON'T WANT TO I I DON'T WANT THAT TO THE
[1:01:57] THE the the spirit of the Lord to move
[1:02:00] over Mary and go to somebody else
[1:02:03] because Mary is is is doesn't have
[1:02:06] enough faith to believe that God can USE
[1:02:09] HER. BUT GOD, SHE SAYS, "HOW CAN IT BE?"
[1:02:12] AND GOD LOOKS AT HER AND SAYS, "ALL
[1:02:14] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITH GOD."
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT'S GOING TO OVERSHADOW
[1:02:19] YOU. THE LIFE, IT'S NOT IN YOU, MARY.
[1:02:22] YOU DON'T PRODUCE IT. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE
[1:02:25] THE bed ground.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; You got to give the bedding ground.
[1:02:29] Amen. If there's no bedding ground, then
[1:02:31] you can't produce fruit.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; You can't produce the fruit. Can I Can I
[1:02:36] get an amen?
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; God wants the fruit OF YOUR WOMB. GOD
[1:02:41] WANTS A SACRED BEDDING ground for his
[1:02:44] word. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. I I I
[1:02:47] I love that. Yeah. I I love that a lot
[1:02:50] to be honest. Amen. Amen. You You You
[1:02:53] don't understand how this how is this
[1:02:55] body CHANGE GOING TO TAKE PLACE? You're
[1:02:57] just eating the word.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; You're just eating and eating and
[1:03:00] feasting on the word. Amen. And you
[1:03:03] don't really even realize it, but you're
[1:03:04] changing.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HOW DID YOU grow when
[1:03:08] YOU WAS A WHEN YOU WAS A BOY OR A GIRL?
[1:03:10] You just kept on feeding. Amen. Mama
[1:03:12] kept feeding and you kept on eating.
[1:03:15] Hallelujah. And and and and and there
[1:03:17] was something in you that that was
[1:03:18] making you stronger and stronger. Well,
[1:03:21] that's what Abraham done. How did
[1:03:23] Abraham go from an OLD MAN TO A YOUNG
[1:03:26] MAN? He just kept eating the promises of
[1:03:28] God.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He couldn't do anything else. HE JUST
[1:03:31] SIMPLY ACCEPTED THE WORD OF GOD. BE IT
[1:03:34] UNTO BE. AND HE JUST ate and he ate and
[1:03:36] he ate and he ate until one day he wakes
[1:03:39] up and Sarah's over there just a young
[1:03:41] lady. He's a young man again. Amen. What
[1:03:44] What is it there? There he he was eating
[1:03:48] and his his food was becoming strength.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; HIS FOOD WAS BECOMING WELL. PRAISE the
[1:03:55] name of the Lord. Do do you just love
[1:03:57] him here tonight?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU GOT TO KEEP ON EATING.
[1:04:01] AMEN. And and BROTHER BRANDMA SAYS WE
[1:04:04] CANNOT receive uh um let's see here. He
[1:04:08] uh uh he hallelujah.
[1:04:11] He says the the the seed you so
[1:04:14] potentially IT'S IN THERE. WHAT IS IT?
[1:04:17] THE WORD PROMISED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[1:04:19] of the world. And around there this only
[1:04:22] reflects the negative. This talking
[1:04:24] about the body. Amen. BUT THAT WILL
[1:04:26] REFLECT THE POSITIVE. THE WORD THE SAME
[1:04:28] THING THE TRANSL UH THE TRANSLATION OF
[1:04:31] THE PRIDE WILL BE THE SAME THING THE
[1:04:34] WORD THAT'S IN YOU THE BODY WILL
[1:04:38] materialize
[1:04:40] around that word the same as it did by
[1:04:44] Sarah
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; JUST BELIEVING THE WORD AND THE BODY THE
[1:04:49] baby
[1:04:51] will begin to grow around that word
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; it took a prophet IN THIS DAY TO TELL US
[1:04:58] THESE THINGS THAT IT'S NOT RELIGION.
[1:05:00] THIS IS NOT RELIGION. IT TOOK A PROPHET
[1:05:03] TO COME BRING THE WORD. WHY THE WORD?
[1:05:06] Because the word that you're feasting on
[1:05:09] is the word THAT IS BRINGING ABOUT THE
[1:05:11] CHANGE, BRINGING ABOUT THE MANIFESTATION
[1:05:15] OF THE PROMISES OF GOD. AND IT'S
[1:05:18] IMPORTANT THAT THAT YOUR that your uh uh
[1:05:22] uh bedding ground is pure. Can you say
[1:05:25] amen? Amen. And so he says that seed it
[1:05:28] will take hold somewhere. Glory to God.
[1:05:32] The only thing he's looking for today is
[1:05:35] a bedding GROUND SOMEWHERE THAT it can
[1:05:38] bed.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of transformation. He
[1:05:43] says that gives us faith. AND WHAT HE
[1:05:46] SAID HERE HE IT'S GOING TO BE
[1:05:50] WHAT WHAT HE SAYS THE PROMISES THAT HE
[1:05:54] SPOKE FOR THIS DAY IS going to be
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; it's going to be somebody say it's going
[1:06:05] to be
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; because there is a if you want to
[1:06:09] brother Brandham would say now you are
[1:06:12] not like
[1:06:14] Eve That's right.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Now, she fell. And he says, "And then
[1:06:19] the seed come, God had him a bride
[1:06:21] coming out of Pentecost."
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then she committed adultery
[1:06:26] and she went off. She fell.
[1:06:29] But you know what the prophet said
[1:06:31] concerning you?
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "But this last day bride cannot
[1:06:37] fail."
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; She cannot fail. AND HERE WE'VE GOT MORE
[1:06:44] WE'VE GOT MORE AGAINST THE BRIDE TODAY
[1:06:47] THAN ANY OTHER DAY.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; If there's anything to to to Amen. to to
[1:06:52] come into the womb of the heart today,
[1:06:54] it's it's here with with all of the
[1:06:56] junk. BUT YET GOD SAYS THERE'S GOING TO
[1:07:00] BE A WOMAN. She's going to be my woman.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; She's going to have my love. She's going
[1:07:05] to be a woman that maybe has a lot of
[1:07:07] mistakes like Sarah. Going to have a lot
[1:07:10] of hardships. Amen. A lot of things
[1:07:13] going around you. Amen. But you know
[1:07:15] what? She is mine. I am hers. We She is
[1:07:22] going to provide or she is going to come
[1:07:25] forth. Well, can you say amen?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; She's going to manifest. Amen. Manifest
[1:07:31] the words of of eternal life.
[1:07:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brandham would
[1:07:36] talk about there in in in in the 18th
[1:07:40] chapter of uh uh he's he's talking about
[1:07:44] Abraham and Genesis. He says now Nean he
[1:07:47] said the 17th chapter now he gave him
[1:07:49] strength for the miracle give him the
[1:07:51] Holy Ghost. In other words, let him draw
[1:07:54] his own God's own life into his own. He
[1:07:57] says now what what do we do when we
[1:08:00] receive the Holy Ghost? We take God's
[1:08:02] life into ours. Is that right? He says,
[1:08:04] "What?" We blend God's life in ours.
[1:08:09] We're sons of God because we draw from
[1:08:12] God. The Holy Spirit that makes us sons
[1:08:16] of God. What does that do? Amen. It gets
[1:08:19] us ready then for the change.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE 17TH CHAPTER,
[1:08:26] they received, it was a type OF THEM
[1:08:27] RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST. And then the
[1:08:30] 18th CHAPTER IS WHEN THE WORD CAME TO
[1:08:33] THEM
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD THAT'S WHEN THE ANGEL OF
[1:08:36] THE LORD APPEARED. PROPHET GOD APPEARED
[1:08:39] AND SAID SARAH IS GOING TO HAVE THAT
[1:08:42] BABY. And Sarah was laughing.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And Sarah saying I don't see how this
[1:08:47] can be. Now watch what brother Brandham
[1:08:49] would say. Amen. About that. He says
[1:08:52] notice immediately after that Sarah
[1:08:54] become pregnant. She knew she was going
[1:08:58] to have this baby. Now, now she's she's
[1:09:02] young now. She's beautiful. Even a king
[1:09:04] fell in love with her and and she and
[1:09:07] and she would have to be outstanding or
[1:09:09] that king would have never fallen in
[1:09:11] love with her. You know, she was a
[1:09:12] beautiful woman. She and and he wanted
[1:09:15] to marry her and God protected her. One
[1:09:17] more thing I want to get to the church.
[1:09:20] Now, some of you sitting here, last
[1:09:23] night when the anointing struck me, I
[1:09:26] feel them little flares in there. I I've
[1:09:29] been trying to think of it and I jotted
[1:09:31] it down here so I won't wouldn't forget
[1:09:33] it.
[1:09:34] I caught that last night that you said,
[1:09:37] "Well, I did so and so. I did so and
[1:09:41] so." Many times I FIND PEOPLE WON'T EVEN
[1:09:44] COME INTO THE PRAYER line because
[1:09:48] and they won't even come into THE PRAYER
[1:09:49] LINE. THEY WON'T EVEN TAKE THEIR NUMBER
[1:09:51] WHEN they're called. They're afraid that
[1:09:54] things will be called up certain things.
[1:09:56] Now, I used to BLAST THAT RIGHT OUT. You
[1:09:59] all know that. And and not unless I'm
[1:10:01] I'm actually uh uh led to do it. I don't
[1:10:03] do it no more. Amen. You Now, you will
[1:10:08] make mistakes.
[1:10:10] YOU SAY, "BROTHER BRANDHAM, NO MATTER
[1:10:12] WHAT I EVER DO, I'LL NEVER BE WORTHY."
[1:10:14] That's right. But look, you say,
[1:10:16] "Brother Brandham, at one time I didn't
[1:10:19] believe the message." I I guess many of
[1:10:22] you didn't. I I wouldn't I wouldn't have
[1:10:24] done it, I guess, myself. I I couldn't
[1:10:27] have done it unless God revealed it to
[1:10:29] me. See, it's a revelation. The whole
[1:10:32] church is built on the revelation.
[1:10:33] Without the revelation, you'll never see
[1:10:35] it. You're blind. He said the the Bible
[1:10:38] says in Matthew 12, I believe it was uh
[1:10:40] where he said, "Though Jesus had done so
[1:10:43] many miracles before them, yet they
[1:10:44] could not believe because Isaiah said
[1:10:47] they got eyes they can't see and ears
[1:10:49] they can't hear." Uh so very really holy
[1:10:53] people, THE CREAM OF THE CROP. SO
[1:10:55] HOLINESS IS NOT ALL. HOLY LIVING IS NOT
[1:11:00] ALL. Faith is the main thing.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm going to repeat it to you
[1:11:07] again. HOLINESS IS NOT ALL.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Holy living is not all.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Faith is the main thing.
[1:11:19] Now he's not excusing anything but he's
[1:11:22] saying if you don't have the bedding
[1:11:25] ground if it's not an open womb before
[1:11:28] be it unto me ACCORDING TO THY WORD
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; all things are not possible then
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; right
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; so we got to keep that heart of faith
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; then all things are possible
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; is that right
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; now now watch he says the holiness was
[1:11:44] not all holy living is not all faith is
[1:11:46] the main thing now Listen, church, I
[1:11:48] want to drop this in here cuz I believe
[1:11:51] the Holy Spirit told me to do it. You
[1:11:54] may be sitting there, which some of you
[1:11:56] are. I know you are. You're disagreeing
[1:11:59] with me right now. Now, I could call
[1:12:02] your name if you want me to. So, know
[1:12:06] that.
[1:12:07] But I can also see further than that
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; that you're going to believe it one of
[1:12:16] these days.
[1:12:23] You come from him.
[1:12:25] You come out of him. You're part of him.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; But it takes divine revelation
[1:12:34] to ignite it as to who you are. And
[1:12:37] that's why we preach service after
[1:12:39] service. We lay it in line upon line. We
[1:12:43] do. The Bible said it would be that way.
[1:12:45] line upon line. Amen. Uh uh what's the
[1:12:48] next word? Uh
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; precept upon precept. Here a little,
[1:12:53] there a little. Will I come before you?
[1:12:57] Is that right? It's his word and it's
[1:12:59] coming. But but but then but what's
[1:13:02] doing it? It's the word. The word that
[1:13:05] you're eating
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; is changing you. The word you're eating
[1:13:10] is creating faith in you.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:13:14] Oh, glory to God. Now, now he says,
[1:13:17] "Now, I'm just going to put this in so
[1:13:20] you'll understand. So, I can give you a
[1:13:23] little spot of grace here when ain't
[1:13:26] going to be too long till you're going
[1:13:28] to change your mind. Some of you will.
[1:13:31] Now, some of you won't. But remember,
[1:13:34] when Sarah first heard that man,
[1:13:37] uh, which she's a type of the church,
[1:13:40] when she heard that and seen the sign
[1:13:42] take place to Abraham, she actually
[1:13:45] laughed about it in her heart. She
[1:13:47] disbelieved and doubt and doubted it
[1:13:49] ever being. So, IS THAT RIGHT? NOW, AT
[1:13:52] THAT TIME, God would have rubbed her
[1:13:55] name off. Is that right? He But he
[1:13:58] couldn't. SHE'S PART OF ABRAHAM.
[1:14:02] They are one.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; This ain't a church membership. The
[1:14:08] feminine part OF GOD IS RIGHT HERE.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:14:20] I it it says uh uh and and if and if and
[1:14:25] if you've been if you've really not been
[1:14:28] excited or not worked up in an emotion,
[1:14:31] not got some church creed, but really
[1:14:34] received the Holy Ghost, really received
[1:14:39] the Holy Ghost, and you're really part
[1:14:43] of Christ
[1:14:45] and still a little skeptic in your mind,
[1:14:49] GOD WILL NOT SHOVE you off from that
[1:14:54] because he can't. You're part of Christ
[1:14:58] and he'll bring you to the truth.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody can say right there with that
[1:15:05] quote, "Be it unto me."
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; If I've been guilty of of being
[1:15:10] skeptical,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; well, can God heal me? Well, can God do
[1:15:14] this? Well, will God, Lord, I'm sorry.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Give me grace. Open my Come on, church.
[1:15:22] This I'm telling you, there's a faith
[1:15:23] that God's wanting to operate in you
[1:15:26] like nobody's business. There is a
[1:15:28] glory. Amen. You were in him. This is
[1:15:32] your day. Arise, shine, for thy light is
[1:15:35] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:15:38] upon thee. THIS IS OUR DAY, little
[1:15:41] bride. THIS IS OUR DAY. THIS IS OUR DAY
[1:15:44] TO BE PREGNANT.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR DAY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:15:49] THAT'S WHY WHEN brother Brandham in the
[1:15:51] early years was saying, "Amen, we're
[1:15:53] going to we're going to get married when
[1:15:54] we get on the other side." But back
[1:15:56] here, Amen. these last few months of his
[1:15:58] of his being here, he's saying, "No, YOU
[1:16:01] ARE MARRIED. YOU HAVE YOU HAVE GOT AN
[1:16:05] INVISIBLE UNION RIGHT NOW."
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; The bedding grounds. Keep the bedding
[1:16:13] grounds pure.
[1:16:16] Now that's that's one thing that you can
[1:16:19] do. Satan Satan fights you one way or
[1:16:21] the other. But you just remember what
[1:16:22] I'm saying. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:26] Undefiled. Can you say amen?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says now it's it's he says it
[1:16:32] now that gives us faith then that what
[1:16:35] he said here it's going to be. So let
[1:16:40] that seed fall into our hearts that we
[1:16:44] might be the bedding grounds of that.
[1:16:46] See, it's our hearts. Let us act out
[1:16:50] this place that he has placed us in in
[1:16:54] these last days. See, LET THE SEED FALL
[1:16:57] IN OUR HEARTS, LORD. LET THY WORD FALL
[1:17:01] IN MY HEART. Let there not be any
[1:17:05] unbelief.
[1:17:07] No unbelief in me, Lord. Amen. Look at
[1:17:11] ME, FATHER. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
[1:17:13] Sometimes I I I I I'M SKEPTICAL.
[1:17:16] SOMETIMES I'M I'M ASKING QUESTIONS
[1:17:18] SOMETIMES. BUT OH GOD, I BELIEVE WITH
[1:17:22] ALL OF MY HEART, YOU'RE MINE, AND I'M
[1:17:24] YOURS.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:28] There's a womb. There's a womb.
[1:17:30] Remember, Amen. Proving his word.
[1:17:32] Brother Brandon would say, "Don't you
[1:17:33] see IN THE SHADOWS?" STOP HERE A MINUTE.
[1:17:36] IN THE LAST DAYS, THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[1:17:39] PLACE PREPARED FOR the word to be made
[1:17:43] manifest.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:49] 11:26-65.
[1:17:52] Amen. Brother Brandon prays. He stops
[1:17:55] while he's preaching and he says, "Oh
[1:17:57] God, I'm hoping I hope I'm speaking to
[1:18:02] ground prepared tonight. If the seed can
[1:18:06] fall in the right place, it's going to
[1:18:11] be something.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[1:18:17] That's a promise.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Do you understand why Satan wants to try
[1:18:21] to get us out of unbelief? But even when
[1:18:24] he's got us out of unbelief or or got us
[1:18:26] out of faith and he's and he's and he's
[1:18:28] pointing all the unbelief and the
[1:18:29] questions of our minds and the different
[1:18:30] things like that, we need to take them
[1:18:32] right back to these quotes that God sent
[1:18:34] to us to stabilize us.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; EVE WAS PART OF ADAM.
[1:18:45] THAT'S WHY ADAM FOLLOWED HER OUT OF THE
[1:18:48] GARDEN.
[1:18:52] Come on.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PART OF CHRIST. THAT'S WHY GOD
[1:18:56] CAME OUT OF THE PARADISES OF HEAVEN DOWN
[1:18:59] TO THIS EARTH.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; TO PAY THE PRICE OF REDEMPTION TO BRING
[1:19:06] YOU BACK.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT GOING TO PAY THAT PRICE IN
[1:19:11] VAIN.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO DIE IN VAIN.
[1:19:16] Every one of God's predestinated seed
[1:19:21] will be there.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And what he put you on earth to do, you
[1:19:26] can
[1:19:29] you can bet your bottom dollar
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; that you're going to be there. You're
[1:19:34] going to do it. Now,
[1:19:37] what it does do to us
[1:19:40] is even though I'm I'm I I I I can be a
[1:19:43] little shaky, there's one thing that
[1:19:45] I've got to do is guard that womb. I
[1:19:48] refuse to let another seed into the womb
[1:19:51] of my heart.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; I may be shaky. I'm question. But Sarah
[1:19:56] ain't going to go out man and let
[1:19:59] another man put seed in her womb.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And the bride of
[1:20:05] Jesus Christ is married. He's she's
[1:20:08] married to him.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And our LIFE CAN ONLY COME FROM HIM. AND
[1:20:13] SHE'S WAITING ON HIM PATIENTLY IN LOVE.
[1:20:17] WAITING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I WONDER. I
[1:20:20] QUESTION SOMETIMES. BUT THERE'S ONE
[1:20:22] THING ABOUT IT. I'M MARRIED TO YOU. AND
[1:20:25] YOUR WORD IS MY EVERYTHING. IF YOU DON'T
[1:20:28] MAKE IT live in me, nothing else will.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] God.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:20:42] OH GOD. FOR THE POWER OF GOD'S creation
[1:20:47] comes by his spirit
[1:20:52] germinating the seed, the life, the word
[1:20:56] within your heart. Can you say amen?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now now brother Brandham in the
[1:21:02] choosing of the bride he would say now
[1:21:04] we find today the modern church a modern
[1:21:05] world church there's the modern world
[1:21:08] church and also the spiritual church and
[1:21:12] both are pregnantated to give birth to
[1:21:13] sons one of them is a denominational
[1:21:16] birth and it's going to give one of
[1:21:19] these days at the world council of
[1:21:21] churches which will produce the world to
[1:21:23] the world the antichrist through a
[1:21:25] denomination that's exactly the truth I
[1:21:28] may not live to see
[1:21:30] I believe I will. But you young people
[1:21:32] remember that you heard a minister say
[1:21:35] that it'll finally wind up and that is
[1:21:38] the mark of the beast and she forms the
[1:21:40] world council of churches and she'll
[1:21:42] give birth to her son the antichrist.
[1:21:46] But he says, "But the other is
[1:21:48] pregnantated by the word
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; and will bring forth the body, the
[1:21:53] finished body of Jesus Christ, which is
[1:21:57] the word uh which is the bride."
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; So there is another woman that is coming
[1:22:01] up and the word is coming in her and
[1:22:04] maturing her. AND THIS BRIDE IS GOING TO
[1:22:06] BE THE FINISHED body of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; She's going to be the matured body of
[1:22:12] JESUS CHRIST. AND SHE IS GOING to be
[1:22:15] pregnantated too.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, the body of Christ isn't
[1:22:22] finished yet." How many knows that?
[1:22:24] Amen. And and and and you know, that was
[1:22:27] way BACK THAT WAS WAY BACK IN ' 65. HERE
[1:22:29] WE ARE IN 2025.
[1:22:32] SO, SO, BROTHER BRADMAN, 63, he was
[1:22:35] saying that the the the virgin bride is
[1:22:37] in her infant stage. That's right.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; The the emp was that in ' 61 where where
[1:22:43] where the where where the five stars
[1:22:45] come together and and uh brother
[1:22:47] Brandamus he said now that was a sign in
[1:22:50] the heavens. God brought the five stars
[1:22:52] together. Grace to the elect. He said a
[1:22:55] a an infant bride is now on earth. Now
[1:22:59] that was back there in the 60s. But now
[1:23:02] today there is a there there is a a more
[1:23:05] clearer picture. We've been able to go
[1:23:08] IN AND LOOK BACK. We can archive. We've
[1:23:10] got them. We we we we can hear the
[1:23:12] tapes. WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ALL before
[1:23:13] us. AND AND THIS WORD that we're eating,
[1:23:16] don't you DON'T YOU THINK IT'S NOT DOING
[1:23:18] ANYTHING FOR YOU, JESSE? AMY, don't you
[1:23:21] think it's not doing ANYTHING FOR YOU.
[1:23:22] THE WORDS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE EATING
[1:23:24] and you're REGURGITATING ON IS DOING
[1:23:27] SOMETHING FOR YOU.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; SEE, we can't teach it. We can't teach
[1:23:33] it. And neither do you teach your body
[1:23:36] your food. Hallelujah. All right. I want
[1:23:39] this food. You want I want this food to
[1:23:41] to to to do this and this food to do
[1:23:43] that. Just just just eat and your body
[1:23:46] will take care of the rest of it. Right.
[1:23:47] And God has built you. You're the bride.
[1:23:50] Just eat the word. Eat the word. Eat the
[1:23:54] word. Keep eating the word. Eat the
[1:23:57] word. Eat the word. We We want to get
[1:23:59] away from well, you know, man's ideas
[1:24:01] and man's opin and our feelings. WE GOT
[1:24:03] TO GET AWAY from these stinking
[1:24:04] feelings,
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; you know, WE LET OURSELVES GET SO
[1:24:08] HARDENED BECAUSE WE, YOU KNOW, AND PRIDE
[1:24:10] DOES IT. WE JUST GET SO STINKING
[1:24:12] PRIDEFUL AND THEN WE GET SET IN our ways
[1:24:14] and and we know WE'RE WRONG. YOU KNOW
[1:24:17] YOU'RE WRONG WHEN YOU'RE WRONG. JUST
[1:24:18] JUST get rid of those feelings and say,
[1:24:21] "Lord, I'M GOING TO LAY THEM AT THE
[1:24:23] ALTAR HERE. YEAH, IT IS. I I if I do not
[1:24:29] if I do not give birth to the word, then
[1:24:32] I'm missing my purpose for being here.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And we're fixing to go home, folks. This
[1:24:38] is our time to give birth to that word.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Take it serious. Keep the womb. I don't
[1:24:46] care. I don't care. Keep the womb. Amen.
[1:24:50] Pure and holy. Keep eating that word.
[1:24:55] Live that word. Amen. Breathe that word.
[1:24:59] Just And brother Brandham says, "Don't
[1:25:01] make yourself some spiritual giant."
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Just believe it. Right.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon when he was preaching
[1:25:10] the the the the future home of the
[1:25:13] heavenly bride, the heavenly groom and
[1:25:15] the earthly bride. He asked when he when
[1:25:17] he's coming out, he's asked Billy Paul,
[1:25:19] "Billy, did or Billy said, "That was a
[1:25:22] good sermon." And and brother Brandham
[1:25:24] says, "Did you understand what I SAID,
[1:25:25] BILLY?" "OH, YEAH."
[1:25:28] He looked back over at him with those
[1:25:30] dark eyes, deep set eyes. "Billy, did
[1:25:33] you understand what daddy was preaching?
[1:25:36] No sir.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's okay, Billy."
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I could count on one hand,
[1:25:47] how many people understood what I was
[1:25:49] preaching this morning, but that's not
[1:25:51] important.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; The important thing, son, is that you
[1:25:56] believe it.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; So, it's not in how you can regurgitate
[1:26:00] it up here. It's how you can say this
[1:26:04] was God's word sent to me.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; That word
[1:26:10] is what pregnant you.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; That word is what brings forth babies.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Spiritual babies. Can you say amen?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Don't shut the seed out. Let it come.
[1:26:22] Don't understand how it works. Well,
[1:26:25] praise the Lord.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; I just want to be pregnant with his
[1:26:30] word. and his words coming out of the
[1:26:33] mouth of a prophet.
[1:26:36] They're divine words. They're divine
[1:26:39] words.
[1:26:41] Amen. Well, praise the Lord. I told you
[1:26:42] it's going to be I I I was going to be
[1:26:44] real quick here tonight. I
[1:26:47] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, now
[1:26:49] remember, he says, "Now the other one is
[1:26:51] pregnant by the word will bring forth
[1:26:53] the body, the finished body of Christ,
[1:26:55] the bride." Amen. The bride, the body of
[1:26:58] Christ isn't finished yet. How many
[1:27:00] knows that? Man and woman are one.
[1:27:02] Christ is the body, the word. The bride
[1:27:05] will have to be the rest of that body.
[1:27:08] And we talked about that this morning.
[1:27:10] And the two together
[1:27:13] makes the one body again. Now, how do
[1:27:16] they do that? When they come together in
[1:27:19] union and they have their baby.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The marriage
[1:27:26] come together in union. the the the THE
[1:27:28] BABY CONSUMMATES A MARRIAGE.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; It's when the two become one.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So Christ, he he
[1:27:39] says now uh the it says uh the the bride
[1:27:43] will have to be the rest of that body
[1:27:44] and the two together make one body like
[1:27:46] Adam was at the beginning. Man and his
[1:27:49] wife are one. She the true bride so sold
[1:27:53] out to him that she used no mind of her
[1:27:56] own. It his mind of course it's his
[1:27:59] will. His will is his word. Well, can
[1:28:03] you say amen?
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Spoken word. He says, "AND WE WERE SOLD
[1:28:08] WITH the word. SOMEDAY I'LL BRING THE
[1:28:11] LIFE INTO the earth and replenish the
[1:28:14] earth." WHAT EVE FAILED TO DO, Mary did.
[1:28:18] She took the word. EVE TOOK SATAN'S LIE.
[1:28:23] MARY TOOK GOD'S word and through Mary's
[1:28:27] seed replenishes the earth through his
[1:28:30] bride, me and you, through his word and
[1:28:32] will bring up the millennium
[1:28:36] through that goes forth the word and the
[1:28:38] word is planted into every predestinated
[1:28:41] heart.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; So, amen. This one here, this Christ
[1:28:45] child that was born, this mysterious
[1:28:48] one, he has a bride.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:53] Now together, Amen. Through the bride,
[1:28:57] through his word, the the Mary's seed,
[1:28:59] which is you and I, replenishes the
[1:29:01] earth again through his ride and through
[1:29:04] the word and will bring up the
[1:29:06] millennium. You talking about giving
[1:29:08] birth? Are y'all understanding
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; what we're doing? What we're doing?
[1:29:13] We're taking the word of God, the fruit
[1:29:16] must come
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; and the millennium.
[1:29:24] I love that quote. Amen. And it will
[1:29:27] bring up the millennium.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You you you you ladies sometimes have
[1:29:36] those big old babies and you think,
[1:29:37] "Woo, how did she do that?" Amen. And
[1:29:40] and uh Amen. But I'm here to tell you,
[1:29:43] this bride is so pregnant. Amen. And
[1:29:46] she's got such divine promise that she
[1:29:48] is going to produce the millennium.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. The eternal gene seed of God.
[1:29:56] Amen. Those words that are coming into
[1:29:58] your what you are believing is going to
[1:30:00] bring will bring it about. Well, can you
[1:30:02] say amen?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Impregnated. Somebody say amen.
[1:30:06] Sew your seed in me, Lord. Sew your seed
[1:30:09] in me. Brother Brandham would say from
[1:30:11] that that little group of the true seed
[1:30:13] of the word, God will present Christ a
[1:30:16] beloved bride, a virgin of his word, and
[1:30:20] through them and by them will be
[1:30:24] fulfilled ALL
[1:30:27] THAT has been promised.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:30:38] I think sometimes the Lord the Lord lets
[1:30:43] us go through the dry spells, lets us go
[1:30:45] through different times in our I think
[1:30:47] he he you know Abraham and Sarah had to
[1:30:51] wait for 25 years
[1:30:56] and sometimes the Lord does those things
[1:30:58] but usually usually if he's if if
[1:31:01] there's someone in here tonight that's
[1:31:02] in a dry spell it it it it doesn't mean
[1:31:05] that you're not pregnant,
[1:31:07] it doesn't mean that God's word's not in
[1:31:09] you.
[1:31:12] In fact, the prophet of God says once
[1:31:14] that womb has sealed that word, it will
[1:31:17] not accept another seed into the womb.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; I know I'm speaking pretty pretty strong
[1:31:22] here tonight. Amen. He says, "But once
[1:31:25] the bride accepts the seed of God into
[1:31:28] her womb and shuts that womb, Amen, it
[1:31:31] will not receive seed from anything
[1:31:33] else."
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] AMEN.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM.
[1:31:40] YOU KNOW HIM. YOU KNOW HIM.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT THE SECOND GOD OF THE GODHEAD.
[1:31:45] HE IS GOD.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And you're his bride.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Well, do you love him
[1:31:53] here tonight?
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; He says THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF
[1:31:56] LIKE IT WAS IN MARY. Now remember he
[1:31:59] says through them and by them will be
[1:32:01] fulfilled all that has been promised for
[1:32:03] his word in the virgin who knows no
[1:32:05] man-made creeds or dogmas the word of
[1:32:07] promise in himself like it was in Mary
[1:32:10] God himself made manifest he will act
[1:32:12] himself by his own word of promise so to
[1:32:15] fulfill all that is written of him as he
[1:32:17] did when when he came from the virgin
[1:32:20] womb type of the spirit womb now amen so
[1:32:25] will the virgin now accepting his word.
[1:32:29] Be it unto me as thou has said.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Well, I wanted to I wanted to share some
[1:32:39] of those with you here today.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; If you if you accept the seed of God,
[1:32:47] if if if you accept it, man, you young
[1:32:50] people, I want to just talk to you for a
[1:32:52] minute. You young people well all of us
[1:32:54] but especially young people
[1:32:57] if you accept the message of the hour
[1:33:00] and and you are you are saying here I am
[1:33:04] then then you will want it exactly
[1:33:06] you'll want you you want to give birth
[1:33:08] to that
[1:33:11] a and
[1:33:13] now now today there's not too many
[1:33:15] people that wants to give have babies
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; amen there's just not a whole lot of
[1:33:19] people that want to have babies anymore
[1:33:21] they've got a lot of things going on.
[1:33:23] And brother Brandon talked about it and
[1:33:24] I'll read it here in a minute, but he
[1:33:25] talked about it way back in ' 65.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; But but it's but it's really the case a
[1:33:30] lot here today. They've got careers.
[1:33:31] They got a lot of things going on. The
[1:33:33] man and the woman, they're they don't
[1:33:34] want babies.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And and and and so they're not
[1:33:37] fulfilling their They're not they're not
[1:33:40] replenishing. Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Of course, as many idiots as there are
[1:33:43] in the world today, it's best they don't
[1:33:45] have babies. Amen. and u
[1:33:51] but some of them anyways maybe we should
[1:33:54] retract that but brother Brandham says
[1:33:55] if a woman won't have a baby for her
[1:33:57] husband she'll take a dog or a cat or
[1:34:00] something she's got to mother something
[1:34:03] it's her nature but to bear a child for
[1:34:05] her husband and raise it into the
[1:34:07] service of God that's entirely out of
[1:34:09] her line oh she'd be disgraced if she
[1:34:12] did by her sinloving society of 1965
[1:34:16] five type of women. A true picture of
[1:34:19] the modern church today. Neither does
[1:34:21] the modern church want any of these here
[1:34:25] screaming, shouting,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; tongue speaking Acts 238 youngans around
[1:34:30] her.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. See, yeah. She don't want
[1:34:34] any of them whooping and crying and
[1:34:36] screaming amen and hallelujah.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Why such a child would immediately put
[1:34:42] her out of her denomination.
[1:34:45] And they they had one like that in one
[1:34:47] of the churches. Why? They had throw her
[1:34:48] out right quick. Why are you letting
[1:34:50] such things go on? So you can see she's
[1:34:53] pregnantated with something cuz she's
[1:34:56] BRINGING FORTH MEMBERS ALL THE TIME.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE DON'T WANT none of them
[1:35:01] screaming,
[1:35:03] hollering, blabbering, Acts 2:38
[1:35:06] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[1:35:08] are.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; It would certainly embarrass her. It
[1:35:12] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:35:16] scientific society of church where she
[1:35:18] belongs. They would throw her out at the
[1:35:21] next council. She can't have it. So she
[1:35:24] don't want to be pregnantated with the
[1:35:26] word because that's the only kind the
[1:35:30] word can produce.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; So we don't want to be ashamed.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:38] Now, the other day in the in the play,
[1:35:40] you you you all uh were shouting. You
[1:35:44] kids were shouting, "Amen." and and uh
[1:35:48] uh you know you were I I know was a part
[1:35:52] of the skit,
[1:35:54] but
[1:35:56] I I the thing is is now when we were
[1:36:00] when we were doing the practice before
[1:36:02] you guys were really a shouting and
[1:36:06] uh then when the skit came along he was
[1:36:08] a little bit more quiet and then when
[1:36:10] today comes along hallelujah.
[1:36:16] Now,
[1:36:17] that was impersonating. That was an act.
[1:36:20] That was Now, I'm hoping y'all was some
[1:36:23] of y'all were saying amen to what I was
[1:36:26] what what I was trying to say at the
[1:36:28] end.
[1:36:31] But we can have an act. We can have an
[1:36:33] act right here in the church
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; in our church services.
[1:36:40] But remember,
[1:36:42] the only kind
[1:36:47] of birth that God that the Bible
[1:36:49] produces, as the prophet would say,
[1:36:52] Amen. The only kind the word can bring
[1:36:55] forth is those miserable, screaming,
[1:36:59] hollering, blabbering. Acts 2:38,
[1:37:02] miserable youngans. And that acts, Amen.
[1:37:05] That's those who have repented, been
[1:37:08] baptized in Jesus' name, and filled with
[1:37:11] the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't always all act the same,
[1:37:15] but the but what happens, Amen. The kind
[1:37:19] of pregnantation that God DOES TO BRING
[1:37:22] ABOUT the new birth in you will be a
[1:37:24] scriptural one, it's one that brings
[1:37:27] desire.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost, you're
[1:37:31] that new creation that I preached about
[1:37:32] this morning. That new creation Amen.
[1:37:36] God Jesus created his own bride.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; And that new creation, you know, when
[1:37:42] the new creation because all of a sudden
[1:37:44] your senses, your desires, your
[1:37:47] everything is I
[1:37:51] I want to give him a child. I I I I want
[1:37:55] his word to live through me. My desire
[1:37:59] your desire is no longer anything else.
[1:38:01] The flirting days are over. The sin days
[1:38:03] are over. the the looking at junk is
[1:38:05] that you have one desire. I want to
[1:38:07] please him. You then know that you have
[1:38:11] you're the new creation. You then know
[1:38:14] that's what the Bible produces. Your
[1:38:17] desires have changed. Your desires. SO
[1:38:20] SO SO THEREFORE you aren't and and and
[1:38:23] and
[1:38:25] I say there should not be anything
[1:38:27] inhibit you. If you want to stand up, if
[1:38:29] there if if if there is something
[1:38:30] screaming out in you saying amen to the
[1:38:32] preacher, you ought to do it. Not not
[1:38:34] hold that back at all. There's no
[1:38:36] difference between an adult and a and a
[1:38:39] cat,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Oh, yes, there is. Amen.
[1:38:42] My mama knows everything about me and I
[1:38:44] have to answer to her." Well, you know
[1:38:46] what? Us adults know a lot about each
[1:38:48] other, too. But you know, when we come
[1:38:50] to the house of God, we're not worried
[1:38:52] about I'm not worried about Brother
[1:38:53] Merl, what he thinks about me, and he's
[1:38:55] not worried about Brother Steve, what he
[1:38:58] thinks about him. And brother Steve is
[1:38:59] not worried about Brother Simeon, what
[1:39:01] he thinks. We come for a purpose.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; We're created FROM HIM. WE'RE BONE OF
[1:39:09] HIS BONE. WE'RE FLESH OF HIS FLESH. WHEN
[1:39:11] THE WORD IS BEING PREACHED, THERE'S
[1:39:12] SOMETHING IN OUR HEART THAT IS SCREAMING
[1:39:14] OUT, "SAY, BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO
[1:39:17] THY WORD."
[1:39:18] IT'S NOT AN ACT. IT'S NOT A PUT ON. IT'S
[1:39:22] THE HOLY SPIRIT WITHIN US THAT HAS
[1:39:24] PRODUCED A YOUNG THAT LOVES HIS WORD,
[1:39:28] LOVES HIS PURPOSE, DESIRES FOR HIS WORD
[1:39:32] TO BE MADE REAL AND LIVING in him.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't settle for anything less.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:46] The brother Bam says, "Oh, you're born
[1:39:48] of the spirit of God. It has the spirit
[1:39:50] of God in it." No intellectual
[1:39:53] churchgoing, joining, creed going,
[1:39:57] bobbed hair, painted face. There's no
[1:39:59] such a thing as that in it at all. You
[1:40:02] don't find that in the word of God. You
[1:40:04] find an oldfashioned sanctified, Holy
[1:40:07] Ghost filled child born of the spirit of
[1:40:10] God, screaming, hollering, shouting, AND
[1:40:13] PRAISING GOD. HOW MANY WANTS TO BE THAT
[1:40:15] KIND OF A OF a have that kind of a baby?
[1:40:18] Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we just want to
[1:40:22] keep on eating.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Amen. He says,
[1:40:29] "Now, we cannot receive the promised
[1:40:32] son."
[1:40:34] Amen. That's that's promised us today in
[1:40:37] these bodies that we live in. These
[1:40:40] bodies are sin. This first conscious
[1:40:42] controls this body with see, taste,
[1:40:46] feel, smell, hear, and it's just got us
[1:40:50] all scrupled up. So he says, "Now you're
[1:40:53] not," and and I'm closing. I am closing,
[1:40:55] but he's saying you're not going to be
[1:40:57] able to receive the promised son, Jesus
[1:40:59] Christ, the millennium, the new the the
[1:41:02] the the new bodies. You're not going to
[1:41:04] be able to receive that if you're
[1:41:07] walking in the five senses.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being fruitful. And I
[1:41:10] want you to really catch me to pinch
[1:41:11] yourself for a minute because I don't I
[1:41:13] I I don't want the devil lulling uh you
[1:41:16] you to sleep yet. Amen. I promise. I'm
[1:41:18] fixing to close. He said, "We cannot
[1:41:20] receive the promised son that's promised
[1:41:22] us today in these bodies that we live
[1:41:24] in. These bodies are sin. You and you
[1:41:28] cannot re you cannot accept the word in
[1:41:30] this these bodies here too. The first
[1:41:32] conscience controls this body. See,
[1:41:34] taste, feel, smell here." And it's just
[1:41:36] got us all scrupled up. It's freezing
[1:41:38] everything else. But that new body that
[1:41:41] comes from this born again, not the
[1:41:44] first conscience, it'll pass away. It's
[1:41:47] that inside something that lives. So
[1:41:50] you're going to have the new birth. The
[1:41:53] new birth
[1:41:56] that that new birth is is when is when
[1:41:59] Eve is taken out of the body and the and
[1:42:04] the and the life is put within her and
[1:42:07] she wakes up and she sees who she IS AND
[1:42:12] ADAM'S LOOKING AT HER AND SAYING BONE OF
[1:42:14] MY BONE FLESH OF MY FLESH SHE COME FROM
[1:42:18] MAN SHE'S PART of me right it becomes a
[1:42:22] LOVE AFFAIR THERE. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:42:24] SAYS SO, SO HE'S SAYING YOU CAN'T RIGHT
[1:42:26] HERE. YOU'RE STILL DEAD. CONSCIENCE,
[1:42:28] TASTE, MEMORY, and all of these things
[1:42:30] here. But, but he says now, Amen. So, he
[1:42:33] says IT'S IT'S BUT THAT COMES but
[1:42:36] there's a new uh but the new body that
[1:42:39] comes from this born again. It's that
[1:42:42] inside something that lives. Everybody
[1:42:44] understand it? Say amen. HE SAYS IT'S
[1:42:47] NOT THIS OUTSIDE SEE, TASTE, SMELL, uh
[1:42:50] uh feel here. It isn't. It's subject to
[1:42:53] death and will die. But the inside part
[1:42:55] of you down in here inside that is the
[1:42:57] person that cannot die. And that's the
[1:43:00] person that the new life starts from.
[1:43:02] And from this new birth and and it
[1:43:04] builds another person in the image of
[1:43:08] this person you are around that life. So
[1:43:11] potentially it's in here. What is it?
[1:43:14] The word promised before the foundation
[1:43:17] of the world. Yes.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; So that's the real you chosen in him.
[1:43:22] You're part of him. That's who you are.
[1:43:24] And around there, this only around here,
[1:43:27] this thing here reflects the negative.
[1:43:29] He says, "But that will reflect the
[1:43:31] positive, the word." And the translation
[1:43:34] of the bride will be the same thing. The
[1:43:36] word that's in you, the body will
[1:43:38] materialize
[1:43:40] around that word.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; SOMEONE SHOUT HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; This body cannot do it. So it'll have to
[1:43:48] be changed the same way to receive the
[1:43:51] son. Well, I just love him.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; I just love him. Hallelujah. Amen. So So
[1:43:57] I wanted to finish my thoughts on this.
[1:44:00] Amen. OH, CHRISTMAS IS far more than
[1:44:05] than than all of the elves and Santaas
[1:44:07] and socks and stockings and and all of
[1:44:10] that. Amen. It's far more than that.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:44:16] M Amen. That's what the devil wants you
[1:44:19] to look at. You know, hallelujah. But
[1:44:22] that's not what God That's what the true
[1:44:25] Christmas was about. That's what it was
[1:44:28] about. Amen. God becoming a flesh. God
[1:44:34] creating himself. God taking the Amen.
[1:44:38] the bride out of that Christ living his
[1:44:42] life through her and her having
[1:44:45] children. her producing. Well, praise
[1:44:48] the Lord
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; right now. It can it can be anything.
[1:44:52] Amen. Whatever he says, whatever God
[1:44:55] will lead your soul to believe,
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; whatever God would lead your soul to
[1:45:05] believe. What is that?
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Whatever he will pregnant you with
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; can happen. Well, there's no telling
[1:45:14] what God can do. Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Hallelujah. Whatever heal
[1:45:20] I Oh my. How did we How did any of these
[1:45:22] miracles that we've that we've known
[1:45:23] over the years? How many How how could
[1:45:25] the any of these kinds of things do in
[1:45:28] of the supernatural? It's God just
[1:45:30] coming down and leading someone. It
[1:45:32] wasn't because they prayed and fasted
[1:45:33] and and wanted to be. Yes, they were a
[1:45:36] virgin to his word and not allowing
[1:45:38] other things in their hearts and minds,
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; not allowing other things to plant
[1:45:42] seeds. But now, Amen. and all of a
[1:45:45] sudden the Holy Spirit would just drop
[1:45:46] something down in their heart
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and something great would take place
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; if the musicians would come. God bless
[1:45:53] you.
[1:45:55] I wanted to finish my my my thoughts on
[1:45:59] that. Amen. Uh uh be I I I want I want
[1:46:03] to be pregnant. Amen. I want I want as
[1:46:06] God's bride. I'm a member of his bride.
[1:46:09] I don't want I don't want to be pregnant
[1:46:11] in the natural. Amen. But I'm a member
[1:46:14] of his bride. Amen. And and and you

[1:46:41] had to be an Adam. And and and God's got
[1:46:44] those things here for us. But what you
[1:46:48] want, you want that to where it'll be a
[1:46:50] beautiful union. That's why we keep
[1:46:52] ourselves pure before men, pure on the
[1:46:58] internet, pure around. We don't want to
[1:47:01] tarnish we don't want to tarnish our um

[1:48:10] Well,
[1:48:12] I love him
[1:48:18] from everything that I've read. And I
[1:48:19] and I just I just put some of these
[1:48:21] quotes here. I was planning on just
[1:48:23] reading them, but there's just such a
[1:48:24] sweet spirit here. I thought I'd talk a
[1:48:26] little bit here, too.
[1:48:30] There's a lot in the message
[1:48:33] on the womb
[1:48:37] and pregnant of God's word.
[1:48:41] I I just I I I I I say it's God's desire
[1:48:44] for us to be fruitful.
[1:48:49] God's not called you to be his wife and
[1:48:54] then and then you be a unic. Can a woman
[1:48:57] be a unic? No, I don't guess so. Celibus
[1:49:00] or what? Whatever. I don't know the
[1:49:03] term. Nonpregant,
[1:49:06] unfruitful,
[1:49:08] where the word has no effect in the
[1:49:10] womb.
[1:49:11] God God don't call us for that. God
[1:49:14] calls us to be fruitful.
[1:49:19] It's his desire. That's what he wants.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; That's why he married you.
[1:49:26] He wants his word to have an effect in
[1:49:28] us.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Well, come on.
[1:49:32] I mean, I I I was I I was looking back
[1:49:34] there in the office uh uh uh or they're
[1:49:37] they're at the house and uh you know um
[1:49:44] you know where they're in in in Isaiah
[1:49:47] says uh in his death he will see his
[1:49:52] seed
[1:49:54] and and talking about the Adam the Eve
[1:49:58] coming out and then and then the next
[1:50:01] verse It it's coming out and his days
[1:50:04] shall be prolonged.
[1:50:07] What what what does that mean? In other
[1:50:09] words,
[1:50:11] there is fruitfulness that is going to
[1:50:14] be taking place. In other words, there's
[1:50:16] going to be a God in bodies on the earth
[1:50:20] throughout the generations. It's just
[1:50:22] this generation is coming to its
[1:50:24] completion.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Well, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[1:50:31] Amen.

[1:51:22] right upon my heart.

[1:51:30] according to your word, oh Lord, be it
[1:51:36] un Oh, let's sing it again. All be it
[1:51:40] unto me

[1:53:11] out of that word? Well, glory. God bless
[1:53:15] you. Let's stand to our feet. Amen.

[1:53:23] song that we sung and I it's just a few
[1:53:26] words.

[2:01:16] married. Amen. And uh this is the true
[2:01:20] story. When we were getting when we were
[2:01:22] getting married
[2:01:24] I I you know I questioned a lot of
[2:01:27] things about me and about you know I was
[2:01:29] I was young and I and and we're back in
[2:01:32] the office at Victor Tabernacle. me and
[2:01:35] dad, we're fixing to come out. And I
[2:01:38] looked at dad and I said, "Dad, I just,
[2:01:40] you know what?
[2:01:47] I don't really know.
[2:01:49] I think I I I don't I don't know if if I
[2:01:54] should get married. I just
[2:01:57] Dad Dad looked at me and he says, "It is
[2:02:00] too late now, fella. We're going out
[2:02:03] there and we're performing a wedding,
[2:02:08] you know. you know, you you know, you I
[2:02:11] mean, because dad, dad was one, you got
[2:02:13] to make sure and he made me read a book
[2:02:14] that thick. And uh uh you know, and I

[2:02:20] to marriage and divorce. And
[2:02:24] there were I mean, there was listen
[2:02:25] there.
[2:02:28] And uh when I came out, I was thinking,

[2:02:35] day and I said, "Listen,
[2:02:37] I loved you back then, but I really do
[2:02:40] love you now." And I think she's just I
[2:02:43] think she's prettier now than ever.
[2:02:46] And you know, and you know, you you you
[2:02:48] know what is what has done this now? She
[2:02:50] was a knockout then and she's a knockout
[2:02:53] now.
[2:02:55] But
[2:02:56] our relationship, we've gone through a
[2:02:59] lot of ups and downs.
[2:03:01] We've gone through a lot of We've gone
[2:03:04] through a lot of stuff.
[2:03:10] But I love her today. It's the stuff.
[2:03:17] She she's there's there's a lot of time
[2:03:19] in my life where she was hanging on. She
[2:03:21] was just she was just hanging on to my

[2:04:28] and here Christ has been right there
[2:04:31] with me and loved me. I I haven't always

[2:04:38] and and and uh but he's been patient
[2:04:41] with me and I you know I he he hasn't
[2:04:44] always seen things the way I see I we we
[2:04:46] we just have but it but it's been
[2:04:48] walking together and I've been learning
[2:04:50] to submit myself to his presence and
[2:04:53] it's been a wonderful road.

[2:05:20] the Lord more today than I've ever loved
[2:05:25] him in my life. I want to please him
[2:05:28] more today than I've ever pleased him.
