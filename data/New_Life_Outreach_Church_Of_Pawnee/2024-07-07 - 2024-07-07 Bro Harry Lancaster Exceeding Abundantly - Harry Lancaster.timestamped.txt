[41:43] all of our needs
[41:45] and as the verse says how he supplies
[41:48] all of our needs and takes care of
[41:50] everything for us and just was kind of
[41:53] thinking
[41:54] about the goodness of God in so many
[41:56] ways and
[41:59] let's kind of see where where exactly we
[42:01] would go with this but first Kings
[42:04] chapter
[42:05] 17 and we're going to start at verse
[42:12] 8 and the word of the Lord came unto him
[42:15] saying arise get thee to zarap which
[42:18] belongeth to zidon and dwell there
[42:21] behold I have commanded a widow woman
[42:22] there to sustain thee so he arose and
[42:25] went to zarafat and when he came to the
[42:27] gate of the city behold the widow woman
[42:30] was there Gathering of sticks and he
[42:32] called to her and said fetch me I pray
[42:34] thee a little water in a vessel that I
[42:36] may drink and as she was going to fetch
[42:38] it he called to her and said bring me I
[42:41] pray thee a morsel of bread in thine
[42:42] hand and she said as the Lord thy God
[42:45] liveth I have not a cake but a handful
[42:48] of meal and a barrel and a little oil in
[42:50] a cruise and behold I am Gathering two
[42:52] sticks that I may go in and dress it for
[42:55] me and my son that we may eat it and die
[42:57] and Elijah said unto her fear not go and
[43:00] do as thou Hast said but make me thereof
[43:02] a little cake first and bring it unto me
[43:05] and after make for thee and for thy son
[43:08] for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel
[43:11] the barrel of Mill shall not waste
[43:13] neither shall the cruise of oil fail
[43:15] until the day that the Lord sendeth rain
[43:17] upon the Earth and she went and did
[43:19] according to the saying of Elijah and
[43:22] she and he and her house did eat many
[43:24] days and the barrel of meal wasted not
[43:27] neither did the cruise of oil fail
[43:29] according to the word of the Lord which
[43:30] he spake by
[43:32] Elijah now we all know this uh this
[43:36] history that that we read in the Bible
[43:37] it's been preached
[43:39] on so many times I'm sure all of us can
[43:42] think of different sermons that have
[43:44] been brought out about this but there's
[43:47] just one point that I'm kind of wanting
[43:49] to to focus on is is as we're talking as
[43:51] we're looking at God's provision here
[43:53] you know God came Elijah was had come
[43:57] and given the the prophecy and said
[43:59] there will be no rain and he had gone
[44:01] out and God was providing for him by the
[44:05] the Ravens bringing him the food and he
[44:07] had the brook to drink from and then
[44:08] finally all of that the brook dried up
[44:11] and there was no more water in the land
[44:12] and it was at that point that God had to
[44:15] provide for the prophet in another way
[44:17] now God could have you know kept the
[44:20] water running he could have had a spring
[44:21] burst up right there to keep the river
[44:23] flowing or the creek flowing or whatever
[44:26] he could have Pro provided in whichever
[44:28] way but God was going to provide in a
[44:31] different way God was going to go a
[44:33] different route than what he expected
[44:35] might be you know Elijah probably wasn't
[44:37] thinking that he was going to have to
[44:38] move again he probably wasn't thinking
[44:41] that he was going to get relocated again
[44:43] until it was time to go back to Ahab and
[44:45] face down everything that was going on
[44:48] he probably thought great I'm here I'm
[44:51] hanging out I'm good I've got my food
[44:54] I've got my water all is well and God
[44:57] could have provided in so many ways um I
[44:59] mean when we first go into the fact that
[45:00] he provided using a raven to deliver the
[45:03] bread and
[45:04] flesh okay he had the original Uber food
[45:08] coming in or the original door Dash take
[45:11] your pick of what you want to call it
[45:12] God did it first um he had the food
[45:15] delivery
[45:16] coming but then when the water dried up
[45:18] God didn't just make a spring he didn't
[45:20] just make a pool form there he didn't
[45:23] just bring a single raincloud to just
[45:25] water where Elijah was he didn't do any
[45:27] of these different ways instead he said
[45:29] I want you to go down to this widow
[45:32] woman I want or I want you to go down to
[45:34] this town I have prepared a widow
[45:37] woman now this widow woman didn't know
[45:39] what was happening she didn't know what
[45:40] was coming and when Elijah comes down
[45:45] she has to make her decision as I said
[45:47] we've heard so many sermons about this
[45:50] but you know God could have provided
[45:52] just for Elijah he could have taken care
[45:56] of just Elijah he could have taken care
[45:58] of just his Prophet but God chose to
[46:01] provide another way that would go above
[46:04] and beyond what Elijah might have even
[46:06] expected Elijah just thought he would be
[46:09] taken care of he just thought I'm here
[46:12] the food will keep coming the water will
[46:14] keep coming I'm set but God looked and
[46:17] went no actually I've got another child
[46:20] that I need taking care of I've got
[46:21] another two children down there that I
[46:22] need taken care of so I'm just going to
[46:24] send Elijah down there so I can take
[46:26] care of all three of you at the same
[46:28] time so I can provide above what you
[46:31] might be
[46:32] expecting the the woman didn't expect to
[46:36] be provided for she thought she was
[46:38] going to have her last meal and she was
[46:40] going to die Elijah thought that he was
[46:42] going to be provided for somewhere else
[46:45] until God spoke to him but then God put
[46:47] them together and went I'm going to
[46:49] provide enough for not just
[46:52] one Elijah by himself not just two the
[46:56] woman and and her child I'm going to
[46:58] make sure that there's enough for all
[46:59] three of you I'm going to make sure that
[47:01] there's enough meal and there's enough
[47:03] oil for the entirety of the for
[47:07] everyone he didn't just provide for the
[47:09] prophet but he sustained the Widow and
[47:11] her son through the entire
[47:14] famine let's turn to 2 Kings chapter 4
[47:36] 2 Kings chapter
[47:37] 4 and we'll start at verse
[47:41] one now there cried a certain woman of
[47:44] the wives of the sons of the prophets
[47:45] unto Elisha saying thy servant my
[47:48] husband is dead and thou knowest that
[47:51] thy servant did fear the lord and the
[47:53] Creditor has come to take unto him my
[47:55] two sons to be Bond men
[47:57] and Elisha said unto her whatat shall I
[47:59] do for thee tell me what hast thou in
[48:02] the house and she said thine handmaid
[48:04] hath not anything in the house save a
[48:06] pot of oil then he said go borrow thee
[48:09] vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even
[48:11] empty vessels borrow not a few and when
[48:14] thou art come in Thou shalt shut the
[48:16] doors upon thee and upon thy sons and
[48:18] shalt pour out into all these vessels
[48:20] and thou shalt set aside that which is
[48:22] full so she went from him and shut the
[48:24] door upon her and upon her son who
[48:27] brought the vessels to her and she
[48:28] poured out and it came to pass when the
[48:30] vessels were were full that she said
[48:32] unto her son bring me yet a vessel and
[48:35] he said unto her there is not a vessel
[48:36] more and the oil stayed and she came and
[48:39] told the man of God and he said go sell
[48:42] the oil and pay thy debt and live thou
[48:45] and thy Children of the
[48:49] rest now this woman came to Elisha to
[48:53] bring to him the need and said
[48:57] my husband is dead and you know that he
[49:01] was a godly
[49:03] man and he even she even calls her
[49:06] husband thy
[49:08] servant so there's some sort of
[49:11] familiarity here some sort of of
[49:14] knowledge Elisha knew who this man was
[49:18] in some way I don't know how close I
[49:21] don't know how far but he knew who he
[49:23] was and the woman could say you know he
[49:27] was a Godly
[49:29] Man and Elisha didn't dispute that he
[49:31] didn't argue that
[49:33] point and I would guess that the woman
[49:36] didn't come to
[49:38] Elisha expecting what was to come she
[49:42] probably came to Elisha in the mindset
[49:44] of can you speak to the
[49:46] creditors can you tell them to go away
[49:49] can you tell them to leave us alone can
[49:51] you tell them to do something can you
[49:54] step in and take care of this sit
[49:56] situation you're the
[49:58] prophet everyone knows you're the
[50:00] prophet if you go and you talk to them
[50:03] they'll probably write off the debt and
[50:04] I can just live with my
[50:06] sons more than likely that's going to be
[50:09] what is in her mind she's not coming in
[50:11] thinking I'm going to go to Elisha so he
[50:13] can do a miracle to pay off my debt for
[50:16] me because that's not the way the human
[50:18] mind works she went to Elisha with okay
[50:21] he has power and authority because he's
[50:23] the
[50:24] prophet he can talk to them for
[50:27] me cuz in this day and age I'm just a
[50:31] woman I can't I can't do that much so
[50:35] the prophet can step in and he can take
[50:36] care of it for me and Elisha even asks
[50:40] he
[50:40] says what shall I do for
[50:44] thee now the scripture doesn't show that
[50:46] there's a pause there it doesn't show
[50:49] that he asks and then waits for her to
[50:51] tell him what do you want me to do he
[50:54] says what would you have me do and then
[50:56] immediately goes
[50:58] into what do you have in your
[51:01] house and she says I have this jar of
[51:05] oil cuz up till now she had probably
[51:08] been trying to do a lot of it on her own
[51:10] selling whatever small possession she
[51:12] might have had in the house to try to
[51:14] pay off the debt to try to do different
[51:15] things to do what she could with what
[51:18] she had and now all she had was I have
[51:21] this
[51:23] oil that's it this is my possession I
[51:27] have this
[51:28] oil and so then Elisha gives her the
[51:31] instruction and says go get as many jars
[51:36] and bowls and containers as you can
[51:39] possibly
[51:40] borrow don't get just a
[51:43] few get as many as
[51:47] possible and so you can just see her
[51:50] sending her kids to go to every single
[51:53] neighbor to go how many spare jars do
[51:56] you have
[51:57] my mom needs
[51:59] them you can just just see it you know
[52:03] here comes Haven running up to knock on
[52:06] the door sister April do you have any
[52:08] spare
[52:09] jars yes I'll take whatever whatever you
[52:12] have well I've got a big one and then a
[52:15] couple small ones I'll take them all
[52:17] whatever you've got well all I've got
[52:18] are two small ones I'll take those and
[52:21] just going through the neighborhood
[52:22] going through the church neighborhood
[52:24] just knocking on doors can I borrow some
[52:26] J jars well what size jars you need
[52:29] doesn't matter I just need jars mom
[52:31] didn't tell me what size I need I just
[52:33] need jars whatever you've got I'll take
[52:36] them I'll take whatever I can
[52:38] get until finally they get every single
[52:41] jar that they can possibly
[52:43] borrow they have bankrupted the
[52:45] neighborhood there are no empty vessels
[52:48] left they're all at their
[52:50] house and then they close up the house
[52:53] and they start to fill them one by one
[52:55] by one
[52:56] until finally there are no empty vessels
[53:00] left every single one is filled with
[53:05] oil
[53:07] and the Widow doesn't actually know what
[53:10] to
[53:11] do she has done this until she goes back
[53:14] to the prophet
[53:15] again saying okay I've got all this
[53:18] oil and so then he instructs and he says
[53:21] great go and sell all the oil that
[53:23] you've got
[53:24] now pay your debts pay off the
[53:27] creditors and then live off the
[53:31] rest God could have provided just enough
[53:33] to pay off the
[53:34] creditors that was the need that she
[53:37] came in with she came in saying the
[53:40] creditors are going to take my
[53:44] children this is what my need is right
[53:48] she didn't say and I have no one to
[53:51] provide I need more she came in and said
[53:54] my need is to save my boys to save my
[53:59] children this is my
[54:02] need and yet in that God goes and
[54:06] provides and goes above it Beyond he
[54:09] goes to provide more he takes care of
[54:12] the
[54:12] need and then he addresses what he
[54:15] already knows will be the next
[54:18] need cuz Hey if she doesn't have a way
[54:20] to
[54:21] provide we're going to end up in this
[54:23] exact same situation down the road she's
[54:25] going to be back in debt to creditors
[54:27] cuz she's trying to
[54:30] survive so God takes the need and
[54:33] provides for it and then he goes
[54:37] beyond just to make
[54:39] sure that she's taken care of to give
[54:43] her so much more than she could expect
[54:46] so much more than she could be looking
[54:51] for as it said in Ephesians now to him
[54:54] that is able to do exceeding and
[54:56] abundantly above all that we ask or
[54:59] think she didn't come in
[55:03] asking for the excess she didn't come in
[55:07] asking for more she came in with this is
[55:11] the need this is
[55:13] what needs to be taken care
[55:16] of but yet God went beyond that God
[55:20] provided abundantly God gave her more
[55:22] and the prophet instructed pay off the
[55:24] debt and then live off of the rest
[55:27] now I'm sure it wasn't so much that she
[55:29] was a rich woman in the neighborhood
[55:32] now but there was enough cu the prophet
[55:35] said and live off of the rest he didn't
[55:39] say live off this until you can get a
[55:41] job or live off this until you can do
[55:44] this or do that he said live off of the
[55:47] rest I don't think that God was putting
[55:49] in a timeline of I'm going to give her
[55:51] enough for six months or I'm going to
[55:53] give her enough for two months or give
[55:54] her enough for whatever it was
[55:56] I'm providing for
[55:59] you maybe he was providing enough until
[56:01] the boys could be old enough to
[56:03] work this might have been not enough for
[56:05] her to live for the rest of her days but
[56:07] maybe it was enough until her boys were
[56:09] old enough that they could go and start
[56:10] having a trade and bring in their income
[56:14] and then they would be able to step up
[56:15] and take care of their widowed
[56:17] mother the scriptures don't say exactly
[56:20] how but it does say God provided more
[56:23] than what the need
[56:24] was he provided abundantly he Pro
[56:28] provided over and above what she was
[56:30] asking
[56:35] for in the same
[56:37] chapter if we drop down to verse 42 2
[56:41] Kings chapter 4 and verse
[56:45] 42 it says and there came a man from
[56:50] balisha and brought the man of God bread
[56:52] of the first fruits 20 loaves of barley
[56:55] and full ears of corn and the husk
[56:57] thereof and he said give unto the people
[57:00] that they may eat and his servant are
[57:02] said what should I set this before in
[57:04] 100 men and he said again give the
[57:07] people that they may eat for thus sayeth
[57:09] the Lord they shall eat and shall leave
[57:11] thereof so he set it before them and
[57:14] they did eat and left thereof according
[57:17] to the word of the
[57:21] Lord God didn't just provide enough
[57:27] the prophet said set it before the
[57:29] hundred set it before the men that are
[57:33] here I mean the servant would have been
[57:35] impressed if just the hundred had all
[57:39] eaten but God told the prophet and told
[57:42] him they will eat and there will be some
[57:46] left now it doesn't say exactly how much
[57:48] is
[57:49] left there could have been a few scraps
[57:52] of loaf on the table and that was it but
[57:54] there was something left
[57:57] it
[57:58] wasn't their empty plates with crumbs it
[58:02] was there was something substantial
[58:04] enough that you could say there is food
[58:07] left if someone else walked in off the
[58:09] street right now there is food to offer
[58:13] there is something worthwhile that is
[58:16] still left we have provided for the
[58:19] hundred and gone beyond that
[58:26] let's go to Matthew chapter
[58:42] 14 Matthew chapter 14 and starting at
[58:45] verse
[58:47] 14 and Jesus went forth and saw a great
[58:50] multitude and was moved with compassion
[58:52] toward them and he healed their sick
[58:56] and when it was evening his disciples
[58:57] came to him saying this is a desert
[58:59] place and the time is now passed send
[59:01] the multitude away that they may go into
[59:03] the villages to buy themselves victuals
[59:06] and Jesus said unto them they need not
[59:08] depart give ye them to eat and they said
[59:11] unto him we have here but Five Loaves
[59:13] and two fishes he said bring them hither
[59:16] to me and he commanded the multitude to
[59:19] sit down on the grass and took the Five
[59:21] Loaves and the two fishes and looking up
[59:23] to heaven he blessed and break and gave
[59:25] the loaves to his disciples and the
[59:27] disciples to the multitude and they did
[59:30] all eat and were filled and they took up
[59:32] of the fragments that remained 12
[59:34] baskets full and they that had eaten
[59:37] were about 5,000 men besides women and
[59:43] children none of
[59:47] these verses that I'm reading are things
[59:49] that we don't probably know by heart
[59:53] most of these are stories that were
[59:54] taught in Sunday School school that
[59:56] probably our children can recite because
[59:58] they've been gone over and covered this
[1:00:01] isn't anything new this isn't anything
[1:00:03] we've never heard
[1:00:05] before but sometimes it's a good
[1:00:07] reminder that God provides and God
[1:00:11] provides abundantly now in no way am I
[1:00:14] trying to do some sort of uh gospel that
[1:00:17] we're all going to get rich and we're
[1:00:18] all going to have so much money that
[1:00:20] we're all going to be
[1:00:21] wealthy but at the same time we don't
[1:00:23] serve a God that has to scrape the
[1:00:26] bottom of the barrel to
[1:00:27] provide when he has the cattle on a
[1:00:29] thousand hills and he can meet every
[1:00:31] single need and so often he does more
[1:00:34] than just meet the need he gives us
[1:00:37] more you know how often in our in our
[1:00:40] lives are we trying to figure out how
[1:00:42] we're going to pay this bill or how
[1:00:44] we're going to do if we're looking at it
[1:00:46] purely from the Physical Realm how we're
[1:00:48] going to provide to do this or provide
[1:00:51] to do that and God will
[1:00:53] provide and maybe in our head we go hey
[1:00:56] I had this much owed on this electric
[1:00:58] bill and somehow I ended up with exactly
[1:01:01] that much extra in my account and we go
[1:01:04] God provided he met that need it's true
[1:01:07] he met that need but did you still have
[1:01:09] food in your
[1:01:10] cupboards did you still have uh gas in
[1:01:14] your vehicle did you still have this did
[1:01:16] you still have that God provided above
[1:01:18] your need God gave you so much more
[1:01:21] maybe it didn't look like it in the bank
[1:01:23] account cuz you paid the bill and maybe
[1:01:25] you're sitting at zero now but yet you
[1:01:28] he didn't leave you to go hungry until a
[1:01:31] few days down the road he didn't leave
[1:01:33] you to be trapped with a vehicle that
[1:01:35] didn't have the fuel to get somewhere he
[1:01:37] didn't leave you to not be able to do
[1:01:39] this or not do
[1:01:40] this we always talk about God providing
[1:01:43] our needs but yet we sometimes forget to
[1:01:46] think about the fact that he almost
[1:01:49] always goes
[1:01:50] beyond just
[1:01:53] that God wants to give us abundantly he
[1:01:57] wants to take care of us he's looking
[1:02:01] down at his children in the same way
[1:02:02] that when we are providing gifts to our
[1:02:05] children we don't give them the bare
[1:02:08] minimum the only reason we would give
[1:02:10] them the bare minimum is because that's
[1:02:12] all I
[1:02:14] got if they got the bare minimum from me
[1:02:16] it's because I just gave them every
[1:02:17] single penny that I had and there's
[1:02:19] nothing else to
[1:02:22] offer but yet that's normally when we're
[1:02:25] giving to our children we may not be
[1:02:27] giving them as much as they
[1:02:29] want or we may not be giving them every
[1:02:32] single thing that they
[1:02:35] desire but we're making sure that their
[1:02:37] needs are met and we're giving them
[1:02:39] above their
[1:02:40] needs you know their needs are make sure
[1:02:43] that they're fed make sure that they're
[1:02:47] clothed if they have any type of toys or
[1:02:50] entertainment or books we have just gone
[1:02:52] above and beyond the
[1:02:54] needs they may not have the newest and
[1:02:57] greatest they may not have the most
[1:02:59] fancy thing out there they may not have
[1:03:01] what every other kid on the block
[1:03:03] has but if they have
[1:03:06] something then they've gotten beyond the
[1:03:12] need they may not always even
[1:03:15] appreciate the above that has been
[1:03:20] given and sometimes we can run into that
[1:03:22] same place where it starts to get common
[1:03:24] to us that God has
[1:03:28] provided that God has provided above
[1:03:31] what we were looking for that God has
[1:03:33] given us that
[1:03:36] more I guarantee that the widow woman
[1:03:39] who receiv received the miracle of the
[1:03:40] oil it wasn't lost on her that she now
[1:03:44] had enough money to live on for a while
[1:03:47] it wasn't lost on her that she didn't
[1:03:50] have to go back to the creditors to
[1:03:51] borrow more money in order to buy food
[1:03:54] for the next week or to buy food for the
[1:03:57] next day it wasn't lost on her
[1:04:01] now she may have had to be Thrifty she
[1:04:05] may have had to make sure that she was
[1:04:08] shopping all the sales shopping all the
[1:04:10] discounts using coupons doing everything
[1:04:13] that she
[1:04:15] could to make this Finance
[1:04:20] stretch but yet she still knew she
[1:04:23] wasn't having to go and borrow God had
[1:04:26] provided God had met the
[1:04:28] need when God fed the
[1:04:32] 5,000 there was nobody that was sitting
[1:04:34] there at the
[1:04:36] end and going man I wish I could have
[1:04:38] eaten a little bit
[1:04:41] more if there was they could have walked
[1:04:43] up and grabbed some from the 12
[1:04:46] baskets there was plenty of food
[1:04:50] left if somebody had been like you know
[1:04:52] I'm still just a little bit peckish I
[1:04:53] think I want just just another piece of
[1:04:55] fish or just another piece of bread they
[1:04:57] could have walked up and grabbed it it
[1:04:59] was
[1:05:00] there but God made sure to provide and
[1:05:04] provide in abundantly for the entire
[1:05:07] group to show that even at the end once
[1:05:11] again they weren't scraping the
[1:05:13] barrel they weren't scraping trying to
[1:05:16] make sure every crumb was used to get
[1:05:18] everyone
[1:05:19] fed it was there was plenty when it was
[1:05:24] done because God provides and he
[1:05:27] provides
[1:05:29] beyond what we may be expecting and he
[1:05:32] provides in ways we're not
[1:05:34] expecting I'm sure the disciples weren't
[1:05:37] expecting Jesus to multiply the food
[1:05:39] they
[1:05:40] had they were pointing out we don't have
[1:05:42] money this is all we got they were
[1:05:46] trying to convince him to send the
[1:05:47] people away they weren't trying to
[1:05:49] convince him to perform a
[1:05:51] miracle that wasn't the mindset
[1:05:56] just like if it
[1:05:58] was you know if it was your boss or if
[1:06:01] it was our pastor that was saying feed
[1:06:04] everybody I can see brother Merl coming
[1:06:07] to him going we don't got no money in
[1:06:09] the we've used up our budget there's
[1:06:12] nothing left to spend we
[1:06:15] can't that's what the disciples were
[1:06:17] doing they're going we have no funds we
[1:06:20] have no way to provide there is no
[1:06:23] option and even beyond that
[1:06:26] if they had the funds how in the world
[1:06:28] are the 12 men going to walk out there
[1:06:31] and bring back enough food for 5,000
[1:06:35] plus so even if they said great we've
[1:06:37] got bags of money how in the world are
[1:06:39] we going to carry enough food back for
[1:06:41] them they were simply pointing out from
[1:06:44] a human standpoint this is not possible
[1:06:48] Lord we need to send them away so they
[1:06:50] can go eat we need to send them to the
[1:06:52] villages we need to send them to the
[1:06:54] towns
[1:06:56] but then another
[1:06:57] interesting concept when you look at it
[1:06:59] is if you had had 5,000 people all
[1:07:03] gathered in
[1:07:05] this would have even The Villages
[1:07:09] around had had enough food to supply for
[1:07:13] that this was not these were not big
[1:07:16] cities they were talking about they were
[1:07:19] like send them to the
[1:07:22] Villages maybe these are Villages of
[1:07:26] 100 maybe a couple
[1:07:29] hundred we got
[1:07:31] 5,000 just
[1:07:35] men we'll call it what a half again with
[1:07:39] women and
[1:07:40] children 7500
[1:07:43] 8,000 people that are here that need
[1:07:46] fed you know how many villages it's
[1:07:49] going to take to make that much
[1:07:52] food to provide this much bread or this
[1:07:55] much
[1:07:59] fish I'm sure the disciples were
[1:08:01] pointing out all of the
[1:08:05] impossibilities I'm sure they were
[1:08:06] pointing out everything you know you've
[1:08:10] got Matthew that knows about money and
[1:08:13] is probably going we don't got close to
[1:08:15] it this is how much we have this is how
[1:08:17] much we could probably buy with
[1:08:20] that you've got other people that are
[1:08:23] workers that are going you know how much
[1:08:26] a working man eats after they've been
[1:08:29] sitting here all day listening they're
[1:08:31] going to be hungry they don't want just
[1:08:33] a half loaf they want a loaf per person
[1:08:36] they want a couple loaves per person
[1:08:37] they want whatever whatever we're going
[1:08:39] to provide there are impossibilities
[1:08:43] here and then Jesus tells them what to
[1:08:46] do and to go beyond that he doesn't just
[1:08:50] provide the need he doesn't just feed
[1:08:52] the people he doesn't just feed his
[1:08:57] disciples but he provides 12 baskets of
[1:09:03] extra he provides enough that if they
[1:09:05] wanted to every disciple could have
[1:09:07] taken a basket home to their family
[1:09:11] there were 12 baskets
[1:09:18] extra let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:09:20] 15 just one chapter later
[1:09:25] Matthew chapter
[1:09:28] 15 and starting at verse
[1:09:33] 29 and Jesus departed from then and came
[1:09:36] nigh unto the Sea of Galilee and went up
[1:09:39] into a mountain and sat down there and
[1:09:41] great multitudes came unto him having
[1:09:43] with them those that were lame blind
[1:09:46] dumb maimed and many others and cast
[1:09:48] them down at jesus' feet and he healed
[1:09:50] them in so much that the multitude
[1:09:52] wondered when they saw the dumb to speak
[1:09:54] and the m to be whole the lame to walk
[1:09:56] and the blind to see and they glorify
[1:09:59] the god of Israel then Jesus called his
[1:10:01] disciples unto him and said I have
[1:10:03] compassion on the multitude because they
[1:10:05] continue with me now three days and have
[1:10:07] nothing to eat and I will not send them
[1:10:09] away fasting lest they faint in the way
[1:10:13] and his disciples say unto him when
[1:10:15] should we have so much bread in the
[1:10:16] wilderness as to fill so great a
[1:10:19] multitude stop there a
[1:10:21] second one chapter ago
[1:10:25] I have no idea what actual timeline is
[1:10:28] in the Bible it looks really short it
[1:10:30] was less than a page one page
[1:10:34] ago God just fed 5,000 and there were 12
[1:10:38] baskets and yet here we are same
[1:10:42] situation and the disciples are going
[1:10:46] again how do we provide food for
[1:10:49] them you would think that at least one
[1:10:51] of them would have been like Lord are
[1:10:53] you going to multiply food again
[1:10:56] are you going to are you going to make
[1:10:58] all the food you would think one of them
[1:11:00] would have said
[1:11:02] this you would think at least one of
[1:11:04] them was thinking it surely somebody in
[1:11:06] the group maybe they weren't bold enough
[1:11:08] to say it but surely there was one of
[1:11:10] them going do I get to see it again do I
[1:11:12] get to see it happen again one more
[1:11:19] time and Jesus Jesus saith unto him how
[1:11:22] many loaves have ye and they said seven
[1:11:25] and a few little fishes and he commanded
[1:11:28] the multitude to sit down on the ground
[1:11:30] and he took the seven Loaves and the
[1:11:31] fishes and gave thanks and break them
[1:11:34] and gave to his disciples and the
[1:11:35] disciples to the
[1:11:37] multitude and they did all eat and were
[1:11:40] filled and they took up of the broken
[1:11:41] meat that was left seven baskets full
[1:11:44] and they that did eat were 4,000 men
[1:11:47] besides women and
[1:11:52] children Jesus does it again
[1:11:55] and again he makes sure that there is
[1:11:59] excess he doesn't go okay I gave excess
[1:12:02] last time this time we'll just make sure
[1:12:05] everybody's fed and that's good
[1:12:06] enough it's like no we're going to go
[1:12:09] ahead and this time we'll do
[1:12:12] seven because seven is completion we'll
[1:12:15] have seven baskets
[1:12:18] extra to show that I completed the work
[1:12:20] I did it all everyone was fed everyone
[1:12:22] was filled here's the bonus
[1:12:25] I have met the need and I've provided a
[1:12:29] little bit extra now there's nothing in
[1:12:30] the scripture that says how big these
[1:12:32] baskets are I don't know if we're
[1:12:34] talking a basket like this hey there
[1:12:38] were seven extra baskets or there were
[1:12:40] 12 extra baskets I don't know if we're
[1:12:42] talking
[1:12:44] about the laundry basket you have at
[1:12:46] home full of food I don't know what size
[1:12:50] basket we're talking
[1:12:53] about but this was more than like a
[1:12:55] teacup this was a sizable amount I mean
[1:12:59] if we heaped one of these full that's a
[1:13:01] decent amount of bread and food in
[1:13:03] it make it seven of those make it 12 of
[1:13:06] those that's a decent amount of food you
[1:13:09] make it a clothes basket or a laundry
[1:13:11] basket that's a lot of
[1:13:15] food now it may not be a lot when you
[1:13:17] look at how many were
[1:13:19] fed even 12 clothes baskets of food
[1:13:24] compared to 7,000 to 8,000 people that's
[1:13:28] not a lot of food it wouldn't go very
[1:13:29] far but it shows there was a lot
[1:13:31] extra and this time we have the seven
[1:13:34] baskets and it's the same thing God has
[1:13:36] provided he has met the need he's taken
[1:13:39] care of all those that were Desiring to
[1:13:42] be
[1:13:43] fed they were Desiring to be fed both
[1:13:45] spiritually and physically because they
[1:13:47] had been there three days they were
[1:13:50] starting to get
[1:13:51] hungry and God made sure to meet all
[1:13:53] their needs and then he went above and
[1:13:57] beyond he made sure that they were all
[1:13:59] fed and then there was some
[1:14:02] excess and you know I'm one of those I
[1:14:04] always look at it and go what did they
[1:14:06] do with all this did they take it and
[1:14:08] just give it to some of the neighboring
[1:14:10] villages to go here's some extra food
[1:14:12] feed whoever's hungry did they take it
[1:14:15] with them and that was their food on the
[1:14:16] journey for a while did
[1:14:18] they I don't know I guarantee they
[1:14:21] didn't just leave it behind a waste
[1:14:23] because Jesus told them to collect the
[1:14:25] extra into a basket so he wasn't saying
[1:14:28] leave the food on the ground for the
[1:14:31] birds so it was used for
[1:14:34] something scriptures don't tell us what
[1:14:36] but it was used for something and so God
[1:14:38] provided and then he went
[1:14:42] beyond and God does the same thing in
[1:14:45] our
[1:14:46] lives God has
[1:14:48] promised you know if go God promised us
[1:14:51] our
[1:14:52] Salvation if that was everything he did
[1:14:54] for us us in our entire lives we would
[1:14:57] have no right to
[1:14:59] complain if all we got was
[1:15:02] salvation then we got the good end of
[1:15:05] the
[1:15:06] deal but yet God instead goes through
[1:15:09] the scriptures and gives us promise
[1:15:11] after promise after promise no I'm going
[1:15:14] to be your healer no I'm going to be
[1:15:17] your standard no I'm going to be the one
[1:15:18] that fights your battles for you no I'm
[1:15:20] going to be the one that does this I'm
[1:15:21] going to do this I'm not just going to
[1:15:22] be your salvation that gives you life
[1:15:24] after death I'm going to give you all
[1:15:27] the things else I'm going to give you
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:30] promise that I've never seen the
[1:15:32] righteous forsaken nor the seed begging
[1:15:34] for
[1:15:35] bread I'm going to make sure that you're
[1:15:37] provided for I'm going to make sure that
[1:15:38] you're taken care of I'm going to make
[1:15:40] sure that the needs are
[1:15:43] met I'm going to make sure that at least
[1:15:45] a few of your wants are
[1:15:46] met no you may never be rich like I said
[1:15:50] this isn't some Prosperity Gospel where
[1:15:52] man if you just if you give in $5 will
[1:15:55] give you back 10 you give in this much
[1:15:57] God will give you double all no we don't
[1:15:59] do
[1:16:00] that but we do have a loving God that is
[1:16:04] generous and he wants to
[1:16:08] provide he wants to meet our needs he
[1:16:12] wants to provide he wants to take care
[1:16:14] of he wants to love on his
[1:16:17] children he wants to love on his
[1:16:23] bride how often for all the husbands in
[1:16:25] here how often do you buy your wife
[1:16:29] something special that you know she
[1:16:31] wants that has nothing to do with
[1:16:35] needs but she mentioned at some point
[1:16:37] hey I really like this coffee cup or I
[1:16:41] really like this dress or I really like
[1:16:46] this decorative piece that goes in the
[1:16:48] house or
[1:16:49] whatever or maybe it's just cuz you know
[1:16:51] hey I know my wife likes chocolate so so
[1:16:54] I better make sure to bring chocolate
[1:16:56] home now and
[1:16:58] then maybe your wife likes flowers and
[1:17:00] so you make sure to bring home flowers
[1:17:02] every now and then or she likes this or
[1:17:04] she likes
[1:17:05] that it's not a
[1:17:08] need it's not a
[1:17:14] requirement there are things that if
[1:17:18] necessary she could do
[1:17:21] without but yet as the loving husband
[1:17:23] you're going
[1:17:25] I want to give this to
[1:17:27] her I want to give her a little bit more
[1:17:30] than the
[1:17:31] needs I want to give her some of the
[1:17:34] things that she enjoys I want to give
[1:17:36] her some of the things that matter to
[1:17:38] her Beyond just we've got a house to
[1:17:41] live in we've got food on the
[1:17:43] table we've got the
[1:17:48] necessities and if the same way that
[1:17:52] Jesus talked about if you as
[1:17:55] a mortal man can give good
[1:17:58] gifts how much more can Our Father in
[1:18:01] Heaven how much more does he look at us
[1:18:03] and go I'm going to meet your
[1:18:07] needs but I want to do more than
[1:18:09] that
[1:18:12] yes he's not promising that we're all
[1:18:17] going to be millionaires with huge
[1:18:19] mansions and servants taking care of
[1:18:21] everything and this that and the other
[1:18:26] but he is
[1:18:27] promising that he's going to take care
[1:18:29] of us he is promising that he's going to
[1:18:31] meet the needs and he is promising that
[1:18:33] he can do more
[1:18:48] Amen in the Old Testament you had
[1:18:51] hundred that were fed and then there was
[1:18:54] excess
[1:18:55] in the New Testament you have two
[1:18:57] different times one time that has 5,000
[1:18:58] plus another time that has 4,000 plus
[1:19:01] and each
[1:19:02] time there's leftover each time there's
[1:19:06] more than what is required to take care
[1:19:09] of
[1:19:11] them Psalms 23 and:
[1:19:15] 5 thou preparest a table before me in
[1:19:17] the presence of I mine enemies thou
[1:19:20] anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:19:22] runneth over
[1:19:25] he doesn't give us a cup that's filled
[1:19:26] halfway he doesn't give us a cup that
[1:19:29] there's barely enough to take one Sip
[1:19:31] and it's empty he keeps pouring and he
[1:19:34] fills until the cup is
[1:19:37] overflowing he provides he meets our
[1:19:39] needs he makes sure that we
[1:19:44] have both what we
[1:19:47] need and a little
[1:19:50] more because he's a good god a loving
[1:19:54] God a caring God he cares about his
[1:19:57] children he cares about his
[1:20:02] bride Psalm chapter
[1:20:04] 34 starting at verse 9 oh fear the lord
[1:20:08] ye his Saints for there is no want to
[1:20:11] them that fear Him the Young Lions do
[1:20:14] lack and suffer hunger but they that
[1:20:16] seek the Lord shall not want any good
[1:20:22] thing so what that tells me there
[1:20:24] something that we are
[1:20:27] wanting first question is is it really a
[1:20:31] good
[1:20:33] thing if I'm sitting there and it's been
[1:20:36] an extended
[1:20:38] period of me wanting and probably in my
[1:20:41] mind going I need
[1:20:43] this is it really a need and is it a
[1:20:47] good thing because the scripture
[1:20:50] says th shall not want for any good
[1:20:54] thing
[1:20:57] now how often do we as people desire
[1:20:59] something that probably isn't a good
[1:21:02] thing it may not necessarily be an evil
[1:21:06] thing but it may not be the good thing
[1:21:10] that we should be longing for that we
[1:21:13] should be Desiring because God promises
[1:21:15] he'll provide every good
[1:21:18] thing he'll provide what we have need of
[1:21:20] he'll provide to take care of us
[1:21:27] Luke
[1:21:29] 6:38 this is the verse that Prosperity
[1:21:32] Gospel loves but I couldn't ignore it so
[1:21:36] give and it shall be given unto you good
[1:21:38] measure pressed down shaken together and
[1:21:40] running over shall men give into your
[1:21:42] bosom for with the same measure that you
[1:21:44] meet with all it shall be measured to
[1:21:46] you
[1:21:49] again I'm always one that repeats myself
[1:21:52] to make sure people catch what I'm
[1:21:54] trying to say and once again I am not
[1:21:58] preaching a Prosperity Gospel in any way
[1:22:00] I am not saying give this money to the
[1:22:03] church or give this money to me or give
[1:22:05] this money to brother Wendell and the
[1:22:07] Lord will blow up everything you've got
[1:22:10] to give you so much more
[1:22:12] no but we do serve a God that provides
[1:22:18] so
[1:22:19] much we've heard the testimonies In This
[1:22:23] Very church building of different
[1:22:25] brothers that they didn't have the money
[1:22:27] to put gas in their
[1:22:28] vehicle and yet somehow it kept going
[1:22:31] and kept going and kept going or they
[1:22:34] even watched the needle go to
[1:22:38] full as they're driving past the gas
[1:22:41] station they weren't stopping and
[1:22:44] pumping but it filled up on its
[1:22:48] own we've heard about
[1:22:52] miracles I remember one when I was
[1:22:55] so much younger I was a kid I remember
[1:22:56] my dad talking about it and I believe it
[1:22:58] was over in India that there was a pot
[1:23:01] of rice in this one town and it was like
[1:23:03] all the food they
[1:23:05] had and the pot kept
[1:23:07] refilling every time
[1:23:10] they brothers and sisters from this
[1:23:12] church would come and they would get
[1:23:13] their portion to eat it kept refilling
[1:23:16] it kept Rene it
[1:23:20] kept multiplying
[1:23:24] and everyone was provided for everyone
[1:23:26] was able to eat in a time when they
[1:23:28] shouldn't have been able to when they
[1:23:30] didn't have the finances or they didn't
[1:23:32] have the food around to even go buy or
[1:23:35] whatever the situation was I was a kid
[1:23:36] so I don't remember the exact details I
[1:23:38] remember that part
[1:23:39] though and I remember my dad talking
[1:23:42] about it and talking about that
[1:23:44] testimony of this pot of rice that
[1:23:47] didn't go down that didn't go
[1:23:52] away we serve a God that provides we
[1:23:55] serve a God that provides in ways that
[1:23:59] we do not expect in ways that we do not
[1:24:03] understand and we serve a God that
[1:24:06] provides Beyond just the very basic
[1:24:10] need and sometimes we begin to take that
[1:24:14] part for
[1:24:15] granted like I said we'll come up and
[1:24:17] we'll praise the Lord that we got this
[1:24:19] much to pay that bill cuz that's what we
[1:24:21] were looking
[1:24:22] for and forget about the fact that God
[1:24:25] had also provided food on the in our
[1:24:29] cupboards and had provided gas in the
[1:24:31] car provided this or that so we had more
[1:24:35] than just the need we may not have had
[1:24:38] more
[1:24:39] dollars than the
[1:24:41] need but we had
[1:24:45] more or you'll have a time when maybe
[1:24:48] you're struggling financially but
[1:24:51] yet you're watching and all the
[1:24:53] neighbors kids or all the other church
[1:24:56] kids have been getting sick and having
[1:24:57] to go to the doctor for stuff you don't
[1:25:00] have the money to take your kids to the
[1:25:02] doctor and yet they're staying healthy
[1:25:05] they haven't gotten sick they haven't
[1:25:06] had any
[1:25:09] problems and do we always remember to
[1:25:11] thank God for our health during those
[1:25:14] times go Lord thank you so much I
[1:25:15] haven't had to go to the doctor I
[1:25:18] haven't money's tight but I haven't had
[1:25:20] to miss work my kids haven't had to go
[1:25:22] to the doctor I haven't had to go buy
[1:25:24] any medicine for them or do this or that
[1:25:26] they've stayed healthy through the midst
[1:25:29] of cold season or through the midst of
[1:25:30] whatever and that's not necessarily a
[1:25:34] major Miracle but at the same time
[1:25:36] you're going thank you for the little
[1:25:37] extra Lord thank you for that cup that
[1:25:41] overflowed a little bit went into the
[1:25:43] saucer to give me just that that little
[1:25:45] bit
[1:25:48] extra now Lord I know that you could
[1:25:50] have provided if I needed to go to the
[1:25:51] doctor you could have provided a way to
[1:25:53] pay the bill you could have provided to
[1:25:55] take care of it you could have healed on
[1:25:57] your own so that I didn't even need to
[1:25:58] go to the
[1:25:59] doctor but Lord thank you that you kept
[1:26:02] them healthy so that I didn't have to do
[1:26:03] any of those
[1:26:05] things thank you that we were able to do
[1:26:07] this thank you that we're able to do
[1:26:11] that because God provides more than just
[1:26:13] our needs he goes above and beyond we
[1:26:16] have the excess we have the
[1:26:21] abundance amen Matthew chapter 6 and
[1:26:25] verse
[1:26:27] 25 therefore I say unto you take no
[1:26:30] thought for your life what you shall eat
[1:26:32] or what you shall drink nor yet for your
[1:26:34] body what you shall put
[1:26:37] on is not the life more than meat and
[1:26:40] the body than
[1:26:41] rment behold the fowls of the air for
[1:26:44] they sew not neither do they reap nor
[1:26:46] gather into barns yet your heavenly
[1:26:48] father Feth them are you not much better
[1:26:51] than they which of You by taking thought
[1:26:53] can add one cubit unto his stature and
[1:26:56] why take you thought for rment consider
[1:26:58] the lies of the field how they grow they
[1:27:01] toil not neither do they spin and yet I
[1:27:03] say unto you that even Solomon in all
[1:27:04] his glory was not AR raid like unto one
[1:27:07] of these wherefore if God so clothed the
[1:27:09] grass of the field which today is and
[1:27:11] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[1:27:13] not much more clothe you oh ye of little
[1:27:17] faith therefore take no thought saying
[1:27:19] what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[1:27:21] or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for
[1:27:24] after all these things do the Gentiles
[1:27:26] seek for your heavenly father knoweth
[1:27:28] that you have need of all these things
[1:27:31] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:27:32] his righteousness and all these things
[1:27:34] shall be added unto you take therefore
[1:27:37] no thought for the tomorrow for the
[1:27:38] marrow shall take thought for the things
[1:27:40] of itself sufficient unto the day is the
[1:27:42] evil
[1:27:46] thereof God's promise seek ye first the
[1:27:49] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:27:51] then all these things shall be added
[1:27:53] unto you
[1:27:55] no God doesn't say we're going to be
[1:27:56] millionaires no God doesn't say we're
[1:27:58] going to be wealthy no God doesn't say
[1:28:00] that we're going to have so much of
[1:28:03] extra but he does say that he's going to
[1:28:05] provide he says if you seek after me
[1:28:08] first I'll make sure that your needs are
[1:28:10] met I'll make sure that you're provided
[1:28:20] for
[1:28:22] God is it's one of those where just what
[1:28:26] God does can just make you smile because
[1:28:28] it's not just that he provides the needs
[1:28:30] but he goes that little bit
[1:28:33] extra it's like that cherry on top of
[1:28:36] the Sunday I could eat the Sunday
[1:28:38] without the Cherry you could eat the
[1:28:40] Sunday without you could eat just the
[1:28:43] ice cream you don't need the whipped
[1:28:44] cream and the cherry and whatever else
[1:28:46] and you'd be very happy at least I would
[1:28:48] you give me a bowl of ice cream I'm good
[1:28:51] but you put the extra on it and it's
[1:28:53] just a little bit better
[1:28:56] just that that little bit extra on top
[1:28:58] of
[1:28:59] it and how often in our lives does God
[1:29:03] give us those little extra
[1:29:06] blessings it's like in the story of
[1:29:08] Esther
[1:29:09] where they were instructed to drop the
[1:29:12] handfuls of purpose for her she was
[1:29:15] already gleaning she was already getting
[1:29:18] enough she was going to have food to
[1:29:21] take home
[1:29:24] but yet Bo as instructed drop a little
[1:29:27] extra give her some
[1:29:31] abundance make sure that there's more
[1:29:34] than she might
[1:29:38] expect make sure to give her that little
[1:29:41] something extra so that's going to make
[1:29:43] her eyes sparkle a little bit make her
[1:29:45] just smile and joyful because she ended
[1:29:48] up with
[1:29:51] more it's like I talked about earlier
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:54] what husbands will do for their wives
[1:29:57] you can just see God sometimes looking
[1:29:59] down on us and going I'm going to give
[1:30:02] him just a little little extra blessing
[1:30:04] right
[1:30:06] there and maybe it's not in the Physical
[1:30:10] Realm maybe it's you know what I think
[1:30:14] this is the service that brother Donald
[1:30:15] needs a little extra touch in service
[1:30:17] I'm going to give him a little something
[1:30:20] extra He's been Faithful he's been doing
[1:30:23] everything he should but I'm was going
[1:30:24] to give him just that little extra
[1:30:25] handful of purpose today I'm going to
[1:30:28] reach down and I'm going to touch
[1:30:29] brother
[1:30:32] Mitch you know he may have been
[1:30:34] struggling with finances or with his
[1:30:36] body or with whatever but I'm going to
[1:30:38] give him a little something extra in the
[1:30:40] spiritual realm I'm going to give him a
[1:30:42] little
[1:30:43] extra courage a little extra peace a
[1:30:45] little extra
[1:30:48] faith and no it won't show up in his
[1:30:50] bank
[1:30:51] account no it won't show up in his
[1:30:54] cupboard or show up in this
[1:30:56] place but he's going to know he got
[1:30:59] it he's going to have he's going to he's
[1:31:01] going to walk out knowing that he had
[1:31:04] that little special
[1:31:06] service that little special
[1:31:09] moment we know that God can give us the
[1:31:11] extra blessings in the Physical Realm
[1:31:13] because he does it time and time again
[1:31:15] but how often does he minister to us on
[1:31:18] the spiritual side and he's giving us
[1:31:20] those little extra
[1:31:21] blessings like I said if all God had
[1:31:23] given us us was our salvation and he
[1:31:25] never offered another thing we still got
[1:31:27] the good
[1:31:30] deal if that was
[1:31:34] it if we had to suffer through the rest
[1:31:37] of our life just
[1:31:39] knowing I've been
[1:31:42] redeemed we are still on the upside
[1:31:47] Hallelujah but yet we have a God that
[1:31:50] looks at us and he pays the price to
[1:31:53] redeem us and then he still goes you
[1:31:55] know what I want to have a relationship
[1:31:58] I want to talk to them I want to
[1:32:00] minister to them I want to be their
[1:32:02] healer I want to be their Confidant I
[1:32:04] want to be everything that they
[1:32:09] need I want to provide every single
[1:32:14] thing I want to provide more than what
[1:32:17] they need I want to give them those
[1:32:19] little bits of extra I want to drop
[1:32:22] those handfuls of purpose I want to
[1:32:23] spill that cup to overflowing
[1:32:26] sometimes sure there are times in our
[1:32:28] lives we go through when maybe the cup
[1:32:30] got spilled a little bit and maybe for a
[1:32:32] season I'm going through with a cup
[1:32:34] that's only half full or 3/4 full but
[1:32:36] God is sitting there waiting to refill
[1:32:39] it again he is waiting to fill it to
[1:32:42] overflowing he is waiting to minister to
[1:32:44] us again and to provide
[1:32:47] more than what we're asking for and to
[1:32:51] provide more than what we would call our
[1:32:53] need
[1:32:55] s God is not a God that does anything
[1:32:58] halfway he is not a God that goes I'm
[1:33:01] going to hit a just that precise and
[1:33:04] that's it nothing
[1:33:08] more God is a God that wants to give us
[1:33:11] the blessings that wants to
[1:33:15] provide amen but sometimes we have to
[1:33:18] work on ourselves to be able to notice
[1:33:22] those blessings
[1:33:24] sometimes like I spoke this morning we
[1:33:26] can kind
[1:33:27] of get used to things around
[1:33:30] us and so we get used to the idea of
[1:33:33] there's food in the cabinet we don't
[1:33:35] necessarily think it of as the extra
[1:33:38] blessing yet if we go to other parts of
[1:33:40] the world they would consider that
[1:33:45] huge but we live in America the Land of
[1:33:48] Plenty so food in our cupboard is not
[1:33:51] necessarily the extra blessing we think
[1:33:55] of but yet it can I mean h how many of
[1:33:59] us in our cupboard have a box of
[1:34:01] something or a can of something that has
[1:34:04] been there for who knows how
[1:34:06] long and it's
[1:34:09] edible but yet we don't necessarily like
[1:34:11] it and so it just stays in
[1:34:14] there we've got and you know it's
[1:34:17] somehow we accidentally bought it or
[1:34:19] someone gave it to us or maybe it came
[1:34:22] with the house
[1:34:24] I don't know which one but there's
[1:34:26] something in that cupboard that has been
[1:34:28] there for
[1:34:30] years or at least
[1:34:32] months and you're like you know you go
[1:34:36] to cook your meal and you look up there
[1:34:38] like ah I really should use that
[1:34:40] sometime not tonight but I'll get to it
[1:34:45] eventually and I'm sure for each one of
[1:34:47] us it's a different ingredient but all
[1:34:49] of us have something there
[1:34:53] and it's excess it's extra none of us
[1:34:57] have gotten to the point where we're
[1:34:58] going man I either eat that or I'm
[1:35:02] starving there is no other
[1:35:05] option because God Is providing he's
[1:35:09] giving us Beyond The Bare
[1:35:14] Necessities he's giving us more
[1:35:29] brother brandham says in the sermon
[1:35:31] Jehovah Dr he says how am I going to do
[1:35:34] it brother brandom I've been through
[1:35:36] prayer lines I've done this I've done
[1:35:38] that how can I do it God will provide
[1:35:41] how are you going to get by with this
[1:35:43] you're saying like that you know you're
[1:35:44] making yourself targets but God will
[1:35:46] provide that's all how you know when you
[1:35:48] stand on the platform this God will
[1:35:50] provide that's all I know he promised it
[1:35:53] we take his word we believe it that
[1:35:55] settles it that's all walk away from it
[1:35:57] cuz God said so that's it that's just
[1:36:00] got to be that
[1:36:03] way God will
[1:36:06] provide and God has proven time and time
[1:36:08] again that he doesn't provide just the
[1:36:11] bare
[1:36:12] minimum I'm not going to say that never
[1:36:14] once in life are we going to hit a point
[1:36:16] where God gives us the bare
[1:36:19] minimum I'm not saying that it's
[1:36:20] impossible that that will happen but I
[1:36:23] am saying that in general through our
[1:36:25] lives if we look God has given us a lot
[1:36:28] more than the bare minimum almost our
[1:36:30] entire
[1:36:31] lives for most of us probably I could
[1:36:35] say our entire life and be accurate I
[1:36:38] know for me I can say
[1:36:40] that that I have if I really think about
[1:36:43] it I have never been at the point where
[1:36:44] I only had the bare
[1:36:46] minimum there have been plenty of times
[1:36:47] when I had less than I might have wanted
[1:36:50] plenty of times where I had less
[1:36:53] then I really thought I
[1:36:55] needed but I can never say that no that
[1:36:58] was the bare minimum we were eating the
[1:37:00] last thing in the cupboard we were there
[1:37:03] was no money in the bank we had no gas
[1:37:06] in the car we had no whatever we had we
[1:37:08] were on the last
[1:37:13] legs but I'm not going to say that could
[1:37:16] never
[1:37:18] happen but I will say for most of our
[1:37:22] lives that doesn't happen
[1:37:24] because for most of our Lives God Is
[1:37:26] providing and he gives us those little
[1:37:28] extra little extra
[1:37:30] pieces that little extra
[1:37:34] provision it's just us remembering to
[1:37:37] notice it it's us remembering to be
[1:37:39] thankful for the little extra to be
[1:37:42] thankful for that box or can that is in
[1:37:45] the cupboard that we haven't eaten in
[1:37:46] months CU we just don't like that
[1:37:49] thing but yet it's
[1:37:51] there because we have food
[1:37:55] and we live in a time when we can be a
[1:37:57] little bit choosy about our
[1:37:59] food we have that much
[1:38:06] extra in the sermon
[1:38:10] Abraham brother brandom says no matter
[1:38:12] what it is the Lamb was there he
[1:38:14] provided a lamb when it needed a lamb
[1:38:17] when you're sick and needs healing he
[1:38:18] will provide for you if you need
[1:38:20] salvation he provides for you if you
[1:38:22] need a Revival he will provide for you
[1:38:25] if the meal Barrel is empty he will
[1:38:27] provide for you amen if you're all
[1:38:29] downhearted and drooped over God will
[1:38:31] provide for you for he was wounded for
[1:38:34] our transgressions bruised for our
[1:38:36] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:38:38] was upon him with his stripes we are
[1:38:40] healed amen the Lord's provided
[1:38:42] sacrifice the Lord's provided
[1:38:47] lamb we serve a God that provides we
[1:38:51] serve a God that that meets our needs
[1:38:53] and that goes beyond
[1:38:57] that and this is just one of those times
[1:39:00] when I think all I'm doing tonight is
[1:39:02] just reminding us to be thankful for the
[1:39:03] little bits of extra we
[1:39:05] get just reminding us to be thankful for
[1:39:09] that little extra food in the cupboard
[1:39:12] or the little extra money that's in the
[1:39:15] bank or the little extra touch that you
[1:39:18] got in
[1:39:19] service or the little extra touch that
[1:39:22] you got in your prayer closet
[1:39:24] doesn't have to be here in church maybe
[1:39:26] the Lord met you in your prayer
[1:39:28] closet maybe the Lord met you while you
[1:39:30] were you one of your sisters while you
[1:39:32] were going around the house singing
[1:39:34] Praise songs and cleaning and the Lord
[1:39:37] came down and touched you just a little
[1:39:39] bit and gave you something a little
[1:39:41] extra maybe it was in the moment you
[1:39:43] didn't expect because in all these
[1:39:46] different situations I think that we can
[1:39:47] go normally the people were not
[1:39:51] expecting for it to be Prov divided the
[1:39:53] way that it
[1:39:55] was people weren't going in
[1:39:59] looking for every one of these
[1:40:01] situations to happen the woman didn't
[1:40:03] come looking for all this oil to
[1:40:07] sell she came probably expecting the
[1:40:10] prophet to go talk to the
[1:40:12] creditors that's what she was looking
[1:40:15] for the disciples didn't come to Jesus
[1:40:18] expecting him to feed the multitude they
[1:40:21] were expecting him to send them away so
[1:40:22] they could go go get their own food
[1:40:26] yes the
[1:40:28] servant didn't expect the food to
[1:40:31] multiply to feed the H hundred
[1:40:32] men he thought Elisha would send at
[1:40:35] least some of them
[1:40:37] away they weren't expecting for God to
[1:40:41] provide the way that he did they weren't
[1:40:43] expecting for this to
[1:40:46] happen the children of Israel as they
[1:40:49] were in the wilderness looking for food
[1:40:50] weren't expecting Moses to promise
[1:40:53] bread to fall from the sky or bread to
[1:40:56] suddenly appear on the
[1:40:59] ground they weren't expecting the Mana
[1:41:02] to be
[1:41:03] offered but yet this was the way that
[1:41:05] God provided this was the way that God
[1:41:07] chose to do
[1:41:09] it Elijah probably wasn't expecting to
[1:41:12] be sent down to this town to live with a
[1:41:15] widow woman and her
[1:41:17] son but yet that was how God provided
[1:41:20] that was the route he chose and in every
[1:41:23] one of these situations God provided
[1:41:25] more than just
[1:41:27] enough but he provided it in his way and
[1:41:30] in his
[1:41:31] time and that's the part that confuses
[1:41:34] us most of the time even with the little
[1:41:36] extra blessings is it doesn't
[1:41:38] necessarily come the way we
[1:41:40] expect and it doesn't come in the manner
[1:41:42] that maybe we wanted it to come and so
[1:41:45] we lose sight of it but it doesn't
[1:41:48] change the fact the fact that God's
[1:41:50] providing and that God is giving us
[1:41:54] more than just the bare
[1:42:02] minimum through the Wilderness they come
[1:42:04] the journey heartaches and Sorrows as
[1:42:06] they pass through Moses got old 120
[1:42:09] years old and one day he was going to
[1:42:11] die so he climbed up to the town to the
[1:42:13] top of Mount pisca And while he was up
[1:42:15] there viewing the promised land death
[1:42:17] struck him that faithful prophet of God
[1:42:20] when there never been one lived like him
[1:42:21] but death struck him and when struck him
[1:42:23] he needed a place that he could die God
[1:42:25] provided a rock that same rock that had
[1:42:28] followed him through the Wilderness he
[1:42:30] climbed up on the Rock and died then he
[1:42:32] needed Paul Bears to bury him and God
[1:42:34] provided angels and they came and packed
[1:42:36] him away somewhere what was it God if
[1:42:39] we'll walk in God's provided way God
[1:42:41] will provide everything we have need of
[1:42:43] God provides no matter what the
[1:42:45] circumstance is he
[1:42:50] provides and the sermon be not afraid
[1:42:54] but therefore see when the Lord wants me
[1:42:55] to go overseas say how do you do that
[1:42:59] somehow another somebody comes and gives
[1:43:01] me the money to go and so and if I have
[1:43:04] to go to a little place I ain't under no
[1:43:05] obligation but what I can go so I just
[1:43:08] where he wants me to go he takes care of
[1:43:10] me and I just live by faith and walk by
[1:43:12] faith and where he whatever whatever he
[1:43:14] wants me to do anything he always
[1:43:16] provides a
[1:43:17] way brother brandom's just talking about
[1:43:19] his own Ministry and he says how do I go
[1:43:22] overseas God provides he didn't say I
[1:43:26] have this big collection agency I have
[1:43:28] this bank account that we put this much
[1:43:29] of your offering in every time or do
[1:43:31] this that or the other he
[1:43:33] said God inspires somebody to give me
[1:43:35] the money when I need to
[1:43:38] go it may not be there the day before
[1:43:42] but when it's time to go God provides
[1:43:44] the
[1:43:47] money and God does the same thing in our
[1:43:50] lives when something needs to happen
[1:43:53] happen God will provide What It
[1:43:57] Takes he's not telling us to go sit on a
[1:44:00] hill and never work another day in our
[1:44:02] life we're still supposed to be doing
[1:44:05] what we're supposed to
[1:44:07] do but if there's something God will
[1:44:12] provide God had provided me with the van
[1:44:15] that we have and we'd only had it for a
[1:44:17] few months and suddenly there was all
[1:44:19] this engine trouble going on with it and
[1:44:22] it was something where they were going
[1:44:23] to have to tear up the the engine and
[1:44:26] replace a head and do all this other
[1:44:27] stuff and it was going to be expensive
[1:44:30] i' only had the van a month or
[1:44:32] two and I definitely didn't have the
[1:44:34] money for that that's not a cheap
[1:44:40] repair and I was trying to figure out
[1:44:42] how in the world am I going to pay for
[1:44:44] this I've got to have a vehicle to get
[1:44:46] to church and I remember that was part
[1:44:48] of my prayer was going Lord you brought
[1:44:50] me to Oklahoma
[1:44:53] and Lord you know that I need to get to
[1:44:55] church and I believe you brought me here
[1:44:57] not just for church but also to be able
[1:44:59] to go there to fellowship and to
[1:45:00] participated and be part of the body not
[1:45:04] just to only show up on Sunday or on
[1:45:08] Wednesday so Lord I got to have a
[1:45:10] vehicle that
[1:45:11] runs you know it's like to get to work
[1:45:15] technically I could probably get on a
[1:45:17] bike and get to work at home it's a
[1:45:20] little longer bike ride than I want to
[1:45:21] take but I could it there's a bus that
[1:45:25] runs in Still Water I could get tickets
[1:45:27] and take the bus and get to work and get
[1:45:30] home the bus stops actually right
[1:45:32] outside my neighborhood and there's a
[1:45:34] bus stop right beside
[1:45:36] Chick-fil-A I could take the
[1:45:38] bus so for work and providing those
[1:45:42] parts I don't have to have a
[1:45:46] car but if God wanted me to attend
[1:45:50] church here in py where I believed I was
[1:45:53] supposed to be at then I had to have a
[1:45:56] vehicle and I couldn't see how I was
[1:45:59] going to be able to provide for that
[1:46:02] vehicle and so we went to the dealership
[1:46:05] to have him look at it figure out how
[1:46:07] much it was going to
[1:46:09] cost and talking to the guy that was in
[1:46:12] charge of the maintenance we were
[1:46:14] like I know this is out of warranty but
[1:46:17] yet I know that there was a vehicle like
[1:46:20] the year before that had a recall for
[1:46:22] the same issue
[1:46:23] is there any chance they could be
[1:46:25] somehow related and
[1:46:26] maybe dodge manufacturing would cover
[1:46:30] this and the guy said I highly doubt it
[1:46:35] he said if this had happened a month ago
[1:46:37] maybe but the guy who works for Dodge
[1:46:39] that I correspond with just got replaced
[1:46:42] so the new guy there I don't have a
[1:46:44] relationship with there's nothing where
[1:46:46] I can try to pull any strings to get
[1:46:48] anything gone and because it's out of
[1:46:51] warranty
[1:46:52] it's probably going to be a no but I'll
[1:46:54] put in their requests just to
[1:46:57] see just to see what
[1:47:03] happens
[1:47:05] and God provided Dodge said if they pay
[1:47:09] for the parts we'll pay for all the
[1:47:12] labor the parts were the cheap
[1:47:17] part the labor was where it was really
[1:47:20] going to hit because it was not a quick
[1:47:24] easy repair this was hours and hours at
[1:47:27] least on the labor bill I didn't do the
[1:47:29] work so I don't know exactly how long
[1:47:30] but on the labor Bill there was a lot of
[1:47:31] hours of
[1:47:33] work and I could afford the parts I had
[1:47:36] that much in my account I could pay that
[1:47:40] bill and God provided God took care of
[1:47:48] it but it was holding on to the promise
[1:47:50] going Lord you you've told me to be at
[1:47:54] church when the doors are open I believe
[1:47:56] you've called me to
[1:47:59] Oklahoma I believe this is where I'm
[1:48:01] supposed to be I believe this is the
[1:48:03] church I'm supposed to be attending I
[1:48:05] believe this is where you've called me
[1:48:07] to bring my
[1:48:09] children and so Lord you have to be the
[1:48:11] one to
[1:48:13] provide I remember there were times in
[1:48:16] the first year that we moved here where
[1:48:18] with all the different activities that
[1:48:19] were going on over here I was trying to
[1:48:22] figure out if I can afford
[1:48:23] gas to get over here that many times a
[1:48:30] week I wasn't used to spending that much
[1:48:32] on gas this was not my normal expenses
[1:48:36] and then I moved here and suddenly my
[1:48:38] gas bill went going up a lot
[1:48:41] higher and I was like all right Lord I
[1:48:44] believe that you called me to be here to
[1:48:46] be part of this
[1:48:48] church and like I said that meant more
[1:48:51] than just being here Sunday and
[1:48:53] Wednesday now it didn't mean that I made
[1:48:55] it to every single birthday event or
[1:48:58] every single
[1:49:00] whatever but it meant that I made it
[1:49:03] to at least some of
[1:49:05] them to be part of the body to be part
[1:49:10] of what was going
[1:49:15] on and I would bring it before the Lord
[1:49:17] and I would pray about it I would go all
[1:49:19] right Lord I'm trusting you that you're
[1:49:20] going to give me the finances I need
[1:49:24] to have the gas to get
[1:49:27] there you know that that was our desire
[1:49:29] that was the reason we mooved to
[1:49:31] Oklahoma was to be part of this kind of
[1:49:36] assembly and then I
[1:49:38] would get a raise at work or maybe I
[1:49:41] would get the opportunity to work a few
[1:49:42] more hours a
[1:49:44] week wasn't that I was suddenly doing 60
[1:49:46] to 80 hours a week or anything but hey I
[1:49:48] got an extra one to two hours of
[1:49:51] overtime this week or I got an extra
[1:49:53] this out of the
[1:49:54] other hey I got a dollar
[1:49:57] raise and none of this was suddenly
[1:49:59] making any work man I'm wealthy I have
[1:50:01] so much money but yet the needs were
[1:50:04] met God provided God made sure that I
[1:50:08] had more than just the
[1:50:10] needs because the bare need is brother
[1:50:13] brandom said be there every time the
[1:50:15] doors open he didn't say be at every
[1:50:19] fellowship if there's that quote I
[1:50:21] haven't seen it yet you're welcome to
[1:50:23] show it to me I know the quote be there
[1:50:25] every time the doors
[1:50:29] open but yet there was that desire there
[1:50:31] was that goal that we want our kids to
[1:50:35] be part of this we want ourselves to be
[1:50:37] part of this we want to be part of this
[1:50:39] body and so Lord you have to be the one
[1:50:41] to provide you have to be the
[1:50:43] one to meet a little more than just the
[1:50:46] need you have to be the one to give that
[1:50:49] little bit of excess
[1:50:54] and be not afraid it is I he says and
[1:50:58] now don't watch for
[1:51:01] miracles don't tell God the way you want
[1:51:03] it just accept the way he gives it to
[1:51:06] you you just take a hold of his promise
[1:51:09] and hold it now that's been my purpose
[1:51:11] that's been what I've been trying to lay
[1:51:14] before this church here in Santa Maria
[1:51:16] is to accept him just by believing his
[1:51:18] word and action see the presence and
[1:51:20] manifestation of Christ and then except
[1:51:23] not only healing but every promise he
[1:51:25] give for the holy spirit for anything
[1:51:27] accept it upon the basis that his
[1:51:29] presence is here to vindicate his
[1:51:32] promise now brother brandom doesn't say
[1:51:35] there will be no
[1:51:36] Miracles but he says don't just sit
[1:51:39] there only watching for
[1:51:43] miracles he said you accept it however
[1:51:45] God gives
[1:51:47] it maybe God used a miraculous way to do
[1:51:51] it
[1:51:54] maybe he gave a miraculous healing maybe
[1:51:57] he had your gas tank go from empty to
[1:52:00] full as you drove by a gas
[1:52:03] station maybe he used a
[1:52:07] miracle maybe he went and he just gave
[1:52:10] you an extra hour or two at
[1:52:12] work maybe he just went and gave you the
[1:52:15] little bit of extra that you needed in
[1:52:17] that moment in that season
[1:52:22] and I most of us aren't going to say I
[1:52:25] got an extra two hours at work this week
[1:52:27] that's a
[1:52:29] miracle we're not going to classify that
[1:52:32] as a
[1:52:34] miracle but brother random says don't
[1:52:37] look for
[1:52:39] miracles he doesn't say ignore
[1:52:43] Miracles but he says accept the way God
[1:52:46] gives it to
[1:52:48] you he said grab hold of the promise and
[1:52:51] hold on to that and then just wait and
[1:52:54] see how God brings it
[1:52:57] about like I said the widow woman wasn't
[1:53:00] expecting her oil to be
[1:53:03] multiplied she probably expected the
[1:53:05] prophet to go talk to the
[1:53:08] creditors she
[1:53:11] didn't the they didn't
[1:53:15] expect the bread and fish to be
[1:53:17] multiplied for the
[1:53:19] multitude they didn't expect God to do
[1:53:22] this way or to do it that
[1:53:26] way Elijah to start off he probably
[1:53:30] didn't expect a raven to show up with
[1:53:32] his
[1:53:33] food we can go back into the verses that
[1:53:35] I didn't read
[1:53:36] yet Elijah was probably a little shocked
[1:53:39] the First Time The Raven showed
[1:53:41] up he's taking a nap then there are
[1:53:45] these birds showing up dropping bread
[1:53:46] and fish in front of him or bread and
[1:53:48] flesh he probably didn't expect this
[1:53:53] but then he got used to it and that was
[1:53:55] the normal and so then he did expect
[1:53:57] it and then God switches and go no I
[1:54:01] want you to go down and live with this
[1:54:02] widow woman she's going to
[1:54:05] provide he probably didn't expect that
[1:54:08] either the widow woman didn't expect
[1:54:11] some strange man to come walking up to
[1:54:12] her and say fix me a cake
[1:54:15] first she expected to
[1:54:20] die God doesn't
[1:54:23] very often work the way we
[1:54:29] expect but yet God doesn't God just
[1:54:32] calls us to hold on to the promise and
[1:54:35] accept however he does
[1:54:38] it hold on to the promise that God gives
[1:54:40] us hold on to the promise and God
[1:54:42] promises he'll provide God promises that
[1:54:45] he'll meet the need and God
[1:54:47] promises that he'll give a little bit
[1:54:50] more
[1:54:52] because that's what he's shown time and
[1:54:54] time again both through the scriptures
[1:54:57] and our own lives that he doesn't just
[1:55:00] provide the bare necessity he provides
[1:55:03] in
[1:55:07] abundance as the musicians go ahead and
[1:55:12] come now every word of God is the seed
[1:55:15] of God and it'll produce just exactly
[1:55:18] what the Bible says it is if you need
[1:55:20] salvation take the seed of God
[1:55:22] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[1:55:24] heavy laden if you need healing I'm the
[1:55:26] Lord that Health thee anything you have
[1:55:28] need of it's a promise in this Bible God
[1:55:31] will take care of every promise and
[1:55:33] listen to this I say this reverently
[1:55:35] quietly so you can remember what God
[1:55:37] will do the right mental attitude
[1:55:39] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:55:41] bring it to pass if you'll take the
[1:55:43] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:55:45] promise it will bring it to
[1:55:48] pass sister if you would mind playing
[1:55:50] great is thy faithfulness
[1:55:57] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:55:59] Divine promise of God will bring it to
[1:56:03] pass the promises are there and the
[1:56:06] prophet tells us to grab hold of
[1:56:08] them to grab hold on the promise and
[1:56:11] then just wait for God to fulfill
[1:56:16] it but he tells us not to go into it
[1:56:19] with a presupposed idea of how God is
[1:56:22] going to fulfill it but to go in just
[1:56:26] expecting that God will fulfill it God
[1:56:30] will provide God will meet the need God
[1:56:34] will take care of
[1:56:40] [Music]
[1:56:45] everything we serve a God that supplies
[1:56:49] all of our need we s serve a God that's
[1:56:52] able to do exceeding abundantly above
[1:56:54] all that we ask or
[1:56:56] think he's able to do so much more than
[1:57:00] we might
[1:57:03] expect he's able to go above what we're
[1:57:07] looking
[1:57:08] for and he shows time and time again
[1:57:11] that he's a God that loves to drop those
[1:57:15] little bits of extra to drop those
[1:57:16] handfuls of
[1:57:19] purpose sometimes they're going to be in
[1:57:21] the Physical Realm sometimes maybe it's
[1:57:24] he gave you an unexpected bonus at work
[1:57:26] or maybe it's he gave
[1:57:28] you this blessing or that blessing
[1:57:31] provided to make sure a bill was taken
[1:57:33] care of or provided to make sure that
[1:57:35] this need was met or that need was
[1:57:38] met but so often it's also providing for
[1:57:41] us spiritually to meet the needs that
[1:57:43] are going in our hearts to answer
[1:57:45] questions that we have that are rolling
[1:57:47] around or maybe it's just for us to be
[1:57:49] able to feel his love and presence that
[1:57:52] maybe we haven't felt for a little
[1:57:55] while that we're able to walk away and
[1:57:57] we're able to go God has given me just a
[1:57:59] little bit more than
[1:58:01] normal God has given me a little
[1:58:04] something special God has given me a
[1:58:06] little bit extra in this
[1:58:11] moment we serve a god of abundance we
[1:58:13] serve a God that has the cattle on a
[1:58:16] thousand
[1:58:19] hills he's not a God that's scraping the
[1:58:22] bottom of the barrel to try to make sure
[1:58:25] that we have what we
[1:58:27] need he's able to provide he's able to
[1:58:31] provide beyond what we ask or think
[1:58:33] provide beyond what just the need
[1:58:39] is we have to work on ourselves to just
[1:58:42] be at the point where we recognize what
[1:58:44] he does that we
[1:58:46] recognize those little extra blessings
[1:58:52] that we can express our thankfulness to
[1:58:54] him that we can
[1:58:55] express that
[1:59:00] thankfulness I'll be the first one to
[1:59:02] say when my wife notices that little
[1:59:05] extra something that I did and she
[1:59:08] thanks me for it it makes me feel like I
[1:59:10] am 10t
[1:59:12] tall that I have succeeded I have
[1:59:16] impressed my wife in some way it's a
[1:59:19] good day
[1:59:22] and God likes to hear the thankfulness
[1:59:24] from his children and from his bride as
[1:59:28] well to know that hey they've noticed
[1:59:31] some of these little extras that I've
[1:59:32] given them they've noticed some of these
[1:59:34] little extra blessings that I've dropped
[1:59:37] off to them they've noticed some of the
[1:59:39] little extra things that I've
[1:59:43] provided and they're not just taking it
[1:59:45] for
[1:59:48] granted we have a world around us that
[1:59:51] they're all struggling and clawing and
[1:59:53] doing their best to grab every single
[1:59:55] thing that they can get I have to have
[1:59:59] the newest phone I have to have the most
[2:00:03] upto-date
[2:00:04] computer or gaming system
[2:00:08] or car or house
[2:00:11] or put in whatever it is that pops in
[2:00:14] your
[2:00:16] head but God comes and he says no I'll
[2:00:20] meet your needs I'll provide for
[2:00:24] you and I'll show you time and time
[2:00:26] again where I give you a little bit
[2:00:28] more I give you a little bit extra
[2:00:34] blessing so I don't know what needs each
[2:00:36] one of us have in our lives what we're
[2:00:38] sitting there and thinking about that I
[2:00:41] know that we have some different ones
[2:00:42] that are struggling with a need for
[2:00:44] healing in their bodies I know some
[2:00:47] different ones that maybe are struggling
[2:00:49] financially or struggling with this are
[2:00:52] struggling with
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:00:55] that we still serve a God that can
[2:00:57] provide we still serve a God that can
[2:01:00] meet every single
[2:01:04] need we have to grab hold of those
[2:01:06] promises and hold on to them just like
[2:01:08] the prophet told us we have to hold on
[2:01:10] to those promises and we have to be
[2:01:12] willing to accept them in the way that
[2:01:15] God gives
[2:01:16] them we can't go in with our own
[2:01:20] expectations of well I know God's going
[2:01:22] to provide through this method he's
[2:01:24] going to provide this
[2:01:25] way he could but probably
[2:01:31] not God doesn't normally do it the way
[2:01:33] that we think it should happen God
[2:01:35] doesn't normally do it the way that we
[2:01:37] think is
[2:01:39] logical God does it his way to show that
[2:01:44] he's in
[2:01:45] control and to show that it's through
[2:01:48] his power and through his grace and his
[2:01:51] Mercy
[2:01:56] ultimately
[2:01:57] everything comes back to us just being
[2:02:00] thankful that we serve such a loving God
[2:02:03] that we serve a God that cares about our
[2:02:07] needs to serve a God that cares about a
[2:02:10] lot of our
[2:02:12] wants and provides those as
[2:02:15] well because he's showing over and over
[2:02:19] again his love for us and his care for
[2:02:21] for
[2:02:23] us we
[2:02:25] aren't children that are left behind or
[2:02:28] tossed to the
[2:02:31] side we
[2:02:33] are to use the Expression we're the
[2:02:35] apple of his
[2:02:37] eye we're the one that he's chosen he's
[2:02:41] desired he's called
[2:02:45] out and he loves us and he takes care of
