[23:57] Jesus.
[24:00] Jesus.
[24:05] There's just something
[24:09] about
[24:12] that name.
[24:16] Master,
[24:18] oh master,
[24:21] savior
[24:24] Jesus.
[24:28] Oh, like a fragrant
[24:33] after
[24:35] the rain.
[24:39] What a name.
[24:41] Oh Jesus.
[24:44] Jesus,
[24:47] Jesus.
[24:52] Let all heaven
[24:55] and earth
[24:58] proclaim.
[25:03] For kings
[25:06] and kingdoms
[25:09] will all
[25:11] pass away.
[25:14] But there's something
[25:17] about
[25:20] we singing now as the man of God comes.
[25:24] Oh
[25:26] Jesus,
[25:27] my my
[25:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[25:34] Jesus.
[25:36] There's just softly
[25:39] about
[25:42] that name.
[25:47] Oh master,
[25:51] savior.
[25:52] Oh my
[25:54] Jesus.
[25:58] Like a fragrance
[26:02] after
[26:04] the rain.
[26:09] Oh Jesus,
[26:13] Jesus.
[26:16] Jesus.
[26:20] Let all heaven
[26:24] and earth
[26:26] proclaim
[26:32] for kings.
[26:51] Jesus. Jesus.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[27:04] There's just something
[27:08] about
[27:11] that.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; You're my master,
[27:19] Savior.
[27:22] Jesus
[27:27] like the fragrance
[27:30] after
[27:33] the rain.
[27:37] Oh Jesus.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Oh dear Jesus. Jesus.
[27:47] Jesus.
[27:50] Yes.
[27:52] And
[27:55] proclaim.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Kings
[28:03] and leaders.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; They will all
[28:09] pass away.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; There's something about
[28:21] And there's something
[28:25] about
[28:29] Jesus.
[28:32] It's a wonderful name.
[28:36] It's the name that
[28:40] angels respect.
[28:44] It's a name that devils respect.
[28:49] I don't care what the devil tries to
[28:51] teach you or what he tries to teach the
[28:54] world.
[28:57] When any devil comes into the presence
[28:59] of the Lord,
[29:02] there's a lot of fear and reverence
[29:04] there.
[29:08] But that name is exalted. That name is
[29:10] high.
[29:12] That name is greater than anything that
[29:14] you're facing tonight.
[29:18] I think recognizing him and honoring him
[29:22] is the greatest thing that we could ever
[29:24] do even in our in our battles, in our in
[29:27] our trials or in the darkest of nights
[29:31] if we could just recognize that the name
[29:34] of Jesus is
[29:37] is greater than any other name
[29:41] and it'll bring heaven down.
[29:45] Praise the Lord. Because if you fear his
[29:48] name, you recognize his name.
[29:51] He always comes where he is loved.
[29:55] He always comes. There's something
[30:00] about
[30:01] our thoughts
[30:04] should be reverent to that name. Our
[30:05] songs should be reverent to that name.
[30:08] Jesus.
[30:11] Jesus. Oh God.
[30:15] Oh God.
[30:16] Jesus.
[30:20] There's just something
[30:23] about
[30:26] your name.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; You're my master,
[30:34] my savior.
[30:38] You're Jesus.
[30:44] Like the fragrance
[30:47] after
[30:49] the rain.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Oh
[30:55] Jesus.
[30:58] Jesus
[31:01] Jesus.
[31:06] Let all heaven
[31:09] and earth
[31:19] Kings and kingdoms
[31:21] &gt;&gt; and kingdoms
[31:22] &gt;&gt; will all pass away.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, but there's one name.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; There's one name.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:37] Blessed be the name of the Lord. There's
[31:41] just something
[31:44] about

[34:47] Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to
[34:51] seek the Lord and to proclaim a fast
[34:54] throughout all Judah. And Judah gathered
[34:57] themselves together to ask help of the
[35:00] Lord, even out of all the cities of
[35:03] Judah. They come to seek the Lord. And
[35:06] Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of
[35:09] Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the
[35:11] Lord before the new court and said, "Oh
[35:14] Lord God of our fathers, art not thou
[35:18] God in heaven and rulest thou not over
[35:21] all the kingdoms of the heathen?
[35:25] And in thine hand is there not power and
[35:27] might, so that none is able to stand
[35:30] withstand thee? Are not thou our God?
[35:34] who did drive out the inhabitants of
[35:36] this land before thy people Israel, and
[35:38] gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy
[35:41] friend forever. They dwelt therein, and
[35:44] have built a sanctuary therein for thy
[35:47] name, saying, If when evil cometh upon
[35:51] us, as the swore judgment, or
[35:54] pestilence, or famine, we stand before
[35:57] this house in thy presence, for thy name
[35:59] is in this house, and cry unto thee in
[36:03] our affliction, when thou then thou will
[36:06] hear and help. Now behold the children
[36:09] of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom
[36:13] thou wouldest not let Israel invade when
[36:16] they came out of the land of Egypt. But
[36:19] they turned from them and destroyed them
[36:21] not. Behold, I say how they reward us to
[36:27] come and cast us out of thy possession
[36:30] which thou hast given us to inherit.
[36:33] Oh our God, wilt thou not judge them?
[36:38] For we have no might against this great
[36:40] company that cometh against us, neither
[36:44] know we what to do, but our eyes are
[36:46] upon thee. And all Judah stood before
[36:50] the Lord with their little ones, their
[36:53] wives, their children.
[36:56] Then upon Jeziel, the son of Zachariah,
[37:00] the son of Baniah, the son of Jahil, the
[37:02] son of Matiniah, a Levite of the sons of
[37:06] Asf. Come the spirit of the Lord in the
[37:08] midst of the congregation.
[37:10] And he said, "Hearken ye all Judah, and
[37:13] ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou,
[37:17] King Jehoshaphat, thus saith the Lord
[37:19] unto you, be not afraid, nor dismayed by
[37:25] reason of this great multitude, for the
[37:27] battle is not yours, but God's."
[37:32] Tomorrow go ye down against them, and
[37:36] behold, they come by the cliff of Ziz,
[37:39] and ye shall find them at the end of the
[37:41] brook before the wilderness of Jeru. Ye
[37:45] shall not need to fight in this battle.
[37:48] Set yourselves, stand ye still, and see
[37:52] the salvation of the Lord with you, oh
[37:55] Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not. Somebody
[37:59] say, "Fear not."
[38:01] Somebody say, "Nor be dismayed."
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Be dismayed.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow go out against them, for the
[38:07] Lord will be with you.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[38:12] we thank you for your blessings tonight.
[38:15] The presence that we feel that we know
[38:18] is here, Lord, as we've heard our little
[38:22] ones, Lord. our our our our little ones
[38:25] and then the all the way up, Father, the
[38:28] young men and women singing that song of
[38:31] that glorious name. Father, we count it
[38:36] an honor to be able to represent you
[38:39] here on the earth, knowing, Lord, that
[38:42] you have never forsaken your people. And
[38:46] I pray, Lord, that you would help us
[38:48] here tonight. Maybe there's someone
[38:50] that's in a battle, Lord, in their mind
[38:53] or in their body or in their family or
[38:56] their job. But oh God, you know exactly
[39:00] where we are all at. And Father, you've
[39:04] got the remedy for every one of us here
[39:06] tonight. And we look to you and we thank
[39:09] you right now, Lord, for hearing. And we
[39:11] thank you right now ahead of time for
[39:14] the blessings that you're going to that
[39:17] you're going to give and the miracles
[39:19] that you are working even as we pray.
[39:22] Father, we thank you for it now. We give
[39:24] ourselves to you tonight and we ask that
[39:26] you would speak to us now in Jesus name.
[39:30] Can the church say amen
[39:32] &gt;&gt; and amen. God bless you. You can be
[39:35] seated here this evening. Amen.
[39:39] We are we are very thankful to God for
[39:42] his many blessings.
[39:45] And as we have just read, I'd like to
[39:47] just go ahead and continue. Amen. We've
[39:51] we just finished reading the 17th verse.
[39:54] Ye shall not need to fight in this
[39:56] battle. Set yourselves. Stand ye still.
[40:00] See the salvation of the Lord with you,
[40:02] oh Jerusalem.
[40:04] Amen. Um, and fear not, nor be dismayed.
[40:08] Tomorrow go out against them, for the
[40:11] Lord will be with you. Now, I I
[40:15] this did not just stop here, but then
[40:17] Jehoshaphat bowed his head to the
[40:19] ground.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. With his face to the ground and
[40:23] all of the Judah and inhabitants of
[40:26] Jerusalem and fell before the Lord,
[40:28] worshiping the Lord. Now, has it not
[40:32] taken place yet? The battle has still
[40:34] got to be fought.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; They're still in an They're still in a
[40:37] in a great great
[40:40] &gt;&gt; This is bad. This is really bad.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; But God is coming on the scene. God's
[40:45] given him his promise. They don't even
[40:48] have to see. Amen. The promise come to
[40:51] pass. They believe what God said
[40:54] &gt;&gt; and they're going to stand upon that
[40:56] word.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Going to stand upon that promise. And
[40:59] they begin to worship the Lord. 19th
[41:02] verse. And the Levites of the children
[41:05] of the Kathites and the children of
[41:07] Korites stood up to praise the Lord God
[41:10] of Israel with a loud voice on high. I
[41:15] would like to minister here this
[41:17] evening. Amen. There's no need to fight
[41:21] in this battle. That's going to be my
[41:23] title here this evening. There's no need
[41:25] to fight in this battle.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. because God's going to fight that
[41:30] battle for us. As we have just read,
[41:33] Jehoshaphat,
[41:34] Amen, was was greatly concerned. Amen.
[41:38] Because the children of Moab and Hammon
[41:40] and Mount Seir, these had come up
[41:44] against Jehoshaphat
[41:47] and and and Judah. And in the natural,
[41:51] Jehoshaphat didn't know what to do. It
[41:53] it was it was a pretty bleak situation.
[41:56] But Jehoshaphat knew one thing.
[41:58] Jehoshaphat was a godly man. He He was a
[42:02] godly leader. Amen. And he knew one
[42:06] thing that Judah was living under the
[42:10] promises of God.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; That God is the one that called them.
[42:16] That God is the one who sent the prophet
[42:18] in the beginning.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That led them out of the children
[42:22] or out of out of Egypt. Amen. and uh and
[42:26] even before that called Abraham
[42:29] &gt;&gt; and his and his sons and Amen and and so
[42:34] Amen. He knew that he was the seed of
[42:37] Abraham.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was. Amen. And the Bible
[42:43] had or God had already told him, "Thy
[42:47] seed shall possess the gates of thine
[42:50] enemies."
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so there he was standing
[42:56] in Solomon's temple. Amen. And and and
[42:59] and he's and he's reminding the Lord. He
[43:02] is saying, "Amen. You said in the
[43:06] dedication OF THIS TEMPLE OR SOLOMON HAD
[43:08] PRAYED." AMEN. uh with IN THE
[43:11] DEDICATION, if this people, if there is
[43:15] ever one of the seeds of uh the any of
[43:18] the members, the children of the seed of
[43:20] Abraham should ever get in trouble, if
[43:23] they would LOOK TO THIS TEMPLE, that you
[43:26] would hear their prayer and that you
[43:29] would answer. Now, here they are many
[43:32] generations down, but they still CAN
[43:36] TAKE GOD BACK TO his word. Amen. Knowing
[43:40] that God will keep his word. Can you say
[43:43] amen?
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; And so when WE ARE IN TROUBLE, I think
[43:47] this is something that we can Amen. that
[43:50] that that we can all look to and say,
[43:52] come back to God and say, you've given
[43:55] us an absolute. You've given us your
[43:57] word.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; God's never promised that everything was
[44:00] going to go rosy. He's never promised
[44:02] that everything was going to go good.
[44:04] Amen. Somebody asked one time, "Well, if
[44:06] you know if if if you're serving the
[44:08] Lord, then Amen. You guys have sickness
[44:10] and you guys have family problems and
[44:13] you guys have these, so do the rest of
[44:15] us." Amen. But I just want to tell you,
[44:17] Amen. We are the royal seed of Abraham
[44:21] in covenant WITH GOD. AND THAT PROMISE
[44:24] is what we've got.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT THAT EVERYTHING GOES GOOD. NOT
[44:29] THAT EVERYTHING IS AMEN. ALWAYS PEACHY.
[44:32] WE'VE GOT A COVENANT WITH GOD. I think
[44:34] that is something that every one of us
[44:36] uh uh parents Amen. It should be
[44:38] something that stabilizes our hearts for
[44:41] OUR FAMILY. GOD, YOU GAVE US A promise
[44:45] and I'm clinging to that word.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God loves to test his people.
[44:51] Amen. He He wants Amen. He sends THE
[44:54] TRIALS. HE ALLOWS THE TRIALS OUR WAY.
[44:57] AMEN. HE HE HE VOLUNTEERS you for
[45:00] trials. Amen. God God done it there with
[45:04] with uh Job and he says, "Have you
[45:06] considered my SERVANT JOB?" AMEN. GOD
[45:09] DOES THAT. GOD BRINGS these things on.
[45:12] BUT YOU SEE, GOD IS WANTING A reaction
[45:16] from HIS PEOPLE. GOD ALLOWS THESE things
[45:19] to come our way, but he's looking for a
[45:22] positive reaction from every ONE OF HIS
[45:25] CHILDREN.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you say that you're the royal
[45:28] seed of Abraham, then he expects you to
[45:30] act like one. Amen. If you ARE IN
[45:33] COVENANT WITH GOD, AMEN. AND YOU BELIEVE
[45:35] GOD IS IS IS STRONG AND IS ABLE, THEN HE
[45:39] EXPECTS YOU TO STAND THERE IN FAITH AND
[45:42] believe him for the promises. Can you
[45:45] say amen? Now, he's going to SEND YOU
[45:47] THROUGH THE ALLOW YOU TO GO THROUGH THE
[45:48] FIERY FURNACE. HE'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU
[45:50] TO GO THROUGH THE LION'S DEN. HE'S GOING
[45:52] TO ALLOW YOU TO AMEN TO EXPERIENCE these
[45:55] things. But remember, your covenant is
[45:59] not based on ON ON A FLOWERY BED OF
[46:03] EASE. It is based upon God's character.
[46:08] God cannot fail.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; He cannot fail. Amen. So as we as we
[46:16] just go along some of these verses that
[46:18] we have just read. Amen. In that in that
[46:21] third verse, there was one thing that
[46:23] Jehoshaphat did. Amen. Number one is he
[46:27] set himself to seek the Lord.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Number two, he proclaimed a fast.
[46:33] So So he he he knew who he was.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHO GOD was and HE WAS GOING TO
[46:42] PETITION THE ONE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD
[46:46] HELP HIM.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, now if he would have went to
[46:51] other nations or if he would have tried
[46:53] his own ability then then then the
[46:56] results would not have been the same.
[46:58] BUT WHEN HE COME TO GOD AND SAID YOU
[47:01] gave the covenant
[47:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? You
[47:07] you we it was God that come and made
[47:09] covenant with you.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought the odds here God
[47:15] is is is all knowing. God is all
[47:18] powerful, but when it comes to you,
[47:20] Amen. Here you are,
[47:25] &gt;&gt; you're you're you're
[47:27] pretty much Well, praise the Lord.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're pretty much worthless
[47:32] &gt;&gt; in that covenant. Amen. Unless you
[47:35] believe.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S CHOSE YOU TO WORK his
[47:40] word, his ways, perform his miracle
[47:43] through. And the only way he's going to
[47:46] be able to do that is when you trust
[47:48] him, believe him.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Look to him to fulfill his word through
[47:52] you.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't. Amen. The last message
[47:56] I preached here was we we talked about
[47:58] uh uh you know uh uh Sarah. Sarah Sarah
[48:01] COULDN'T PRODUCE AT ALL. SHE never could
[48:02] have children. She never could. Amen.
[48:05] But God chose Sarah because God was
[48:08] going to receive THE HONOR. AND GOD HAS
[48:11] CHOSEN YOU. SO QUIT LOOKING AT YOUR
[48:14] INABILITIES. QUIT LOOKING AT YOUR
[48:16] WORTHLESSNESS. QUIT LOOKING AT YOUR
[48:18] FAILURES. WE ARE IN COVENANT WITH GOD. I
[48:22] DIDN'T MAKE THE COVENANT. HE MADE THE
[48:24] COVENANT. YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE COVENANT.
[48:28] YOU ACCEPTED THE COVENANT. AND GOD IS
[48:31] GOING TO FULFILL HIS WORD IN YOU.
[48:36] OH, IF WE COULD STAND THERE IN THE TRIAL
[48:38] AND BE LIKE JEHOSHAPHAT AND SAY, "GOD,
[48:42] I'M LOOKING TO YOU. I'M LOOKING TO YOUR
[48:45] PROMISE. I REFUSE TO LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE
[48:49] BUT your word."
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Judah gathered themselves
[48:56] together. Amen. Bible says they come
[48:59] from all of the cities and they come to
[49:01] church. Hallelujah. They all come to
[49:04] church and uh Amen. to ask the Lord to
[49:08] help. Amen. And and and so uh uh you
[49:12] know I I you know and and again I before
[49:14] I get off of this remember God uses
[49:19] trouble to declare his glory.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; How many's got some situations in your
[49:24] life that you really need God?
[49:27] Hallelujah. Well, it's not the time to
[49:30] despair.
[49:31] IT'S NOT THE time to get discouraged.
[49:34] IT'S THE TIME TO SET YOUR FACE TOWARD
[49:38] THE LORD.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan tries to defeat God's purpose
[49:46] and he and and and uh Amen. But but WHEN
[49:50] HE'S TRYING TO WORKS so hard to defeat
[49:52] God's purpose in your life, but in all
[49:55] reality, he is actually bringing God's
[49:59] purpose. Amen. Uh to fruion in your LIFE
[50:03] BECAUSE AND AND I WONDERED WHY I THOUGHT
[50:06] ABOUT THIS. WHY DOES GOD ALLOW THE
[50:07] troubles is BECAUSE IT IT REQUIRES
[50:11] DESPERATION.
[50:13] IT REQUIRES WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR
[50:15] MONEY AND YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING GOING
[50:17] FOR YOU AND AND AND and you've got, you
[50:20] know, uh everything just, YOU KNOW, JUST
[50:22] HANDED TO you uh on a silver platter.
[50:25] you you you uh YOU YOU'RE NOT DESPERATE.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S WHEN YOU GET DESPERATE BEFORE
[50:33] GOD,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. When you're missing a
[50:37] paycheck or when Amen. you ain't got the
[50:39] money to to to to make the ends meet or
[50:42] when mama's fixing to Amen. mama's been
[50:45] diagnosed with cancer OR DADDY'S GOT
[50:47] THIS THAT and the other. You got a CHILD
[50:49] THAT IS WAVERED. WHAT DOES IT DO? IT
[50:53] BRINGS A DESPERATION AND THE VERY THING
[50:56] THAT SATAN WOULD USE AGAINST YOU TO get
[50:59] you to turn around. Hallelujah. He
[51:01] forgets that you're the royal seed of
[51:03] Abraham. He forgets, AMEN. THAT YOU'VE
[51:06] GOT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT
[51:09] THE REST OF THE WORLD DON'T HAVE. HE
[51:11] FORGETS THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD HE
[51:13] PUSHES YOU, ALL IT DOES IS MAKES YOU
[51:16] MORE DESPERATE, MAKES YOU WITH GREATER
[51:18] INTENSITY, GIVES YOU GREATER DESIRE TO
[51:21] SERVE THE LORD.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jeremiah, one of my favorite
[51:27] scriptures, if you wouldn't mind putting
[51:29] that up there. I believe it's in
[51:30] Jeremiah 31:9,
[51:32] Sister Keys. Amen. And it and it says,
[51:35] "And they shall come with weeping and
[51:38] with supplications
[51:41] will I lead them."
[51:43] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL COME WITH WEEPING. SEE, SEE,
[51:46] SOMETIMES, THEN IF YOU DON'T MIND
[51:47] LEAVING THAT UP THERE, SOMETIMES YOU'RE
[51:49] ANOINTED WHEN YOU'RE WEEPING.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU'RE ANOINTED WHEN YOUR
[51:55] SPIRIT IS IN TURMOIL. SOMETIMES YOU'RE
[51:58] MORE ANOINTED THEN THAN WHEN YOU'RE
[52:01] RUNNING THE AISLES. AND YOU'RE JUMPING
[52:04] AND SHOUTING AND YOU'RE PRAISING THE
[52:06] LORD. AMEN. BE IT'S GOOD. HALLELUJAH. TO

[52:11] $100 BILL AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK
[52:13] FOR IT.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But it's when you're needing that
[52:17] $100 bill. Amen. For uh you're needing
[52:20] something, you know, you're you're
[52:21] fixing to be h put out of your house or
[52:25] CAR IS FIXING TO BE TAKEN AWAY.
[52:27] SOMETIMES IT'S in the weeping and THE
[52:32] SUPPLICATION
[52:34] THAT GOD IS LEADING YOU.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; YES. That's right.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; That's incredible.
[52:42] That's incredible because it's when
[52:44] you're crying
[52:47] and you're in desperation
[52:50] and you are it brings the real character
[52:53] of your heart out because then Amen.
[52:57] There's only one thing that matters to
[52:59] you as a Christian. It gets down to the
[53:02] very root of things. I need you more
[53:04] than I need anything else.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; With supplications will I lead them. I
[53:11] will cause them to walk by the rivers of
[53:14] water in a straight way wherein they
[53:19] shall not stumble. Ah, for I am a father
[53:22] to Israel and Ephraim is my firstborn.
[53:26] Can you say amen? AMEN. WHAT DOES
[53:28] supplication mean? Amen. Supplication is
[53:31] an earnest, sincere
[53:34] appeal. It's an urgent request. Amen.
[53:38] FROM TO TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE POWER TO
[53:41] GRANT THAT REQUEST. SO SUPPLICATION IS
[53:43] IS NOT JUST SAYING A PRAYER, A LAY ME
[53:46] DOWN TO SLEEP PRAYER, BUT SUPPLICATION
[53:48] IS AN EARNESTNESS THAT IS SAYING,
[53:51] LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT WHAT I NEED. AMEN.
[53:55] AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO UNTIL I
[53:58] GET WHAT I NEED from you.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I I'm going to walk IN
[54:05] THIS WAY. I'M A DESIRE. AMEN. IT'S
[54:07] BRINGING OUT THE REAL TRUE AMBITION.
[54:09] WELL, PRAISE the Lord. Amen. It brings
[54:12] out WHO YOU REALLY ARE. THE TRIAL BRINGS
[54:15] IT OUT. MANY TIMES IN the trial, yes,
[54:18] there's a lot of frustration and and
[54:20] there's a LOT OF CONFUSION AND THERE CAN
[54:22] BE A LOT OF OF THIS THAT OR THE OTHER.
[54:25] BUT FOR a believer, amen, YOU KEEP ON
[54:27] DIGGING DOWN. You keep on getting a
[54:29] little BIT AMEN. THE FURTHER THAT YOU
[54:31] FIND THAT rock and that rock is
[54:33] predestination, brother. That rock IS
[54:35] SOMETHING THAT GOD PLACED in your heart.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DISBELIEVE IF YOU WANTED TO.
[54:40] WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. YOU'VE
[54:43] BEEN BORN OF GOD.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet would say, "When you get
[54:51] desperate about this thing, something
[54:53] will take place."
[54:56] &gt;&gt; When you get desperate about this thing,
[54:58] something will take place. He said, "But
[55:00] you're not desperate enough. Oh, well,
[55:02] I'll join the church, and that settles
[55:03] it." But you have to be desperate about
[55:05] it if you have to really need God. Jesus
[55:09] said, "Blessed are they who do hunger
[55:12] and thirst after righteousness, for they
[55:14] shall be filled." But as long as you're
[55:16] satisfied with the things of the world,
[55:17] how can God ever speak to you? You say,
[55:19] "God never spoke to me." Why? He wants
[55:21] to, but you're too filled up with the
[55:24] things of the world. And that's what's
[55:26] the matter with us today. We we put all
[55:28] our time on things of the world and
[55:29] pleasures of the world and give no time
[55:31] for God. That's true. Amen. NOW WE FIND
[55:33] OUT THAT ISAIAH GOT DESPERATE. HE
[55:36] SCREAMED OUT AND CONFESSED HIS SINS AND
[55:38] confessed the sins of the of the people.
[55:40] And when he got through confessing, he
[55:42] heard a noise from above him. And when
[55:44] he looked up, there was the cherubam
[55:46] flying back and forth through the
[55:48] building, wings over their faces, wings
[55:51] over their feet, flying with wings, and
[55:53] they were crying, "Holy, holy, holy Lord
[55:57] God Almighty."
[55:59] See Isaiah got desperate and God come on
[56:04] the job. Well, can you say amen?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN ISAIAH OR JOSIAH JOAT, AMEN,
[56:12] BEGAN TO PRAY. NOW I WANT US TO LOOK AT
[56:15] THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD you along
[56:16] here tonight.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Now I want us to look here. If you WANT
[56:19] TO GET THE attention of God, Amen. FIRST
[56:22] OF ALL, HE SET HIS FACE toward God
[56:26] IN DESPERATION. AND HE CALLED FOR A
[56:28] FAST.
[56:30] THE PEOPLE ALL GOT, YOU KNOW, I THINK
[56:32] IT'S GOOD FOR I I I I good good
[56:35] oldfashioned prayer meetings.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember prayer meetings. We
[56:39] used to have have prayer meetings. We've
[56:41] had many needs in this church and we got
[56:43] together in desperation. And how many
[56:46] how many can say that you are witness to
[56:49] what God has done during those times?
[56:51] Why? It's because there's something of
[56:54] calling that body together. Can you say
[56:56] amen? But then when he begins to say his
[56:59] prayer, HE DOESN'T START OUT SAYING,
[57:02] "AMEN, LORD, here I am. Uh uh, I need
[57:06] you. Where are you at?" No. Amen. What
[57:08] does he do? The very first thing he does
[57:10] is begin to exalt the name of God.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; He begins to say, "Thou art the God.
[57:16] Thou art the one who has called.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; You are the one who done it for our
[57:20] Amen. for for Abraham. You're the one
[57:23] that brought him out of Egypt. YOU'RE
[57:25] THE ONE I AM CALLING TO YOU BECAUSE you
[57:29] are the one that is worthy. Well, praise
[57:31] the Lord.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I think every prayer that we pray should
[57:34] start out just like that.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. If you if you YOU YOU
[57:40] DON'T I I YOU KNOW I I I IF IF if if all
[57:44] of my children or grandchildren, if all
[57:46] they ever done is just come in and and
[57:47] and just wanting to uh you know, just
[57:50] wanting something from me all the time,
[57:52] I'd begin to wonder if they love me.
[57:53] Hallelujah. AMEN. BUT BUT BUT I WANT
[57:57] THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHO I AM. REC. AND I
[58:01] TELL YOU WHAT, IF THERE'S ANYBODY THAT
[58:03] DESERVES TO BE HIGH AND LIFTED UP,
[58:07] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T WENDLE MARTIN. IT AIN'T YOUR
[58:09] DADDY. IT AIN'T YOUR MAMA. IF THERE'S
[58:11] ANYONE THAT DESERVES TO BE HIGH AND
[58:14] LIFTED UP,
[58:16] &gt;&gt; IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO CAN HELP YOU,
[58:19] DADDY WINDOW CANNOT. IT CAN ONLY GO SO
[58:22] FAR. WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. DADDY
[58:25] JOHN CAN ONLY GO SO FAR. DADDY MERL CAN
[58:28] ONLY GO SO FAR. BUT THERE IS A GOD.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; WHO IS IN COVENANT WITH ME. THERE'S A
[58:37] GOD WHO IS IN COVENANT WITH YOU.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Give him honor. GIVE HIM GLORY. SET HIM
[58:44] HIGH. JESUS SAID, AMEN. WHEN THEY SAID,
[58:47] "TEACH US TO PRAY." WHAT WAS HIS VERY
[58:50] FIRST WORDS? OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN
[58:53] HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME. SET APART
[58:57] BE THY NAME. LIFTED HIGH IS YOUR NAME.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; That's good preaching.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Then you go on down, give us the bread
[59:09] and give us our needs. And can you say
[59:12] amen?
[59:14] It's a heart of humility
[59:18] saying that I cannot do this in myself.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; It's a heart of humility saying I'm
[59:24] going to surrender what I think is right
[59:28] and I'm going to follow you in your
[59:31] word. You called me. YOU GIVE ME YOUR
[59:34] PLAN and I am the one that's going to
[59:38] believe it and follow you. Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You want to get the
[59:43] attention of God? Amen. Set your face
[59:47] toward him.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get desperate. Lift him up high.
[59:52] Can you say amen?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the seventh verse, just
[59:57] going through these things, you can go
[59:58] back home and read in your devotion, but
[59:59] the seventh verse has stood out to me.
[1:00:01] Amen. He began to remind God of his
[1:00:05] promises.
[1:00:07] HE TAKES GOD BEFORE HE ASKS a thing. He
[1:00:11] starts going back and saying, "Now Lord,
[1:00:14] you gave that promise." Lord, you gave
[1:00:18] and and he began to tell him, "AMEN. OF
[1:00:21] ALL OF HIS WORKS." Begin to tell REMIND
[1:00:24] HIM OF WHAT I think sometime I believe
[1:00:27] God just loves it when we start
[1:00:28] reminding him of what he's told us.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; God, you said you'd never leave me.
[1:00:34] God said, "Huh, I love hearing that from
[1:00:37] you." Well, can you SAY AMEN?
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD, YOU SAID YOU'D MEET ALL my
[1:00:42] needs according to your riches in Christ
[1:00:45] Jesus. Hallelujah. I tell you what.
[1:00:48] Amen. My I my wife can get my attention
[1:00:51] a lot more by saying that kind of stuff
[1:00:53] and complimenting me. Amen. ABOUT WHAT
[1:00:56] WHAT MY PROBLEM THAN SHE WOULD BE BY
[1:00:58] TEARING me down and telling me how bad I
[1:01:01] am.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; All right. TELLING ME WHERE YOU AT. WHY
[1:01:04] AIN'T YOU GOT THIS DONE? I MEAN, HELLO.
[1:01:06] AMEN. LORD, here we are. These are THREE
[1:01:09] KINGS ARE MORE THAN US AND THEY'RE
[1:01:11] FIXING TO KILL US. WHAT'S GOING ON? NO,
[1:01:13] HE SAYS, GOD, YOU gave the promise.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; I I think there is something about
[1:01:24] praying God's word. I I I you know I I
[1:01:28] I've been in my situations and I'll
[1:01:29] gather up all of the promises that God's
[1:01:32] given and I'll just start praying.
[1:01:34] Hallelujah. I'll start praying. What am
[1:01:36] I doing? I am confessing what God has
[1:01:39] already said. And the Bible says that he
[1:01:42] is the high priest of my confession.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; He wants to hear you tell him his word.
[1:01:52] Amen. It feels like the heater's on. I
[1:01:54] don't know if it's on or not, but we can
[1:01:55] turn that heater off. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:58] But the um the So, WE WE WE'VE GOT WE'VE
[1:02:03] got a promise. WE'VE WE'VE GOT A WE
[1:02:06] WE'VE BEEN GIVEN PROMISES, BUT WE'VE GOT
[1:02:09] TO COME at one with that promise
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and claim that promise and say, "God,
[1:02:15] I'm coming in union with you. I'm
[1:02:18] believing what you said. Be it unto me
[1:02:22] according to your word.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; So, there's something about there's
[1:02:29] something about a covenant man. There's
[1:02:30] something about a covenant woman.
[1:02:32] They're praying is not a prayer of woe
[1:02:36] is me. IT'S NOT A PRAYER OF PLEASE HELP.
[1:02:40] It's not. It is, but it's not. Amen. A
[1:02:43] covenant people, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
[1:02:48] SOMEBODY REPEAT. I KNOW WHO I AM. ONE
[1:02:54] MORE TIME. I KNOW WHO I AM.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU START
[1:03:05] ACTING LIKE SONS OF GOD.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; YOU START ACTING LIKE DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:03:12] THE WOE IS ME ATTITUDE IS GONE. YOU ARE
[1:03:16] IN COVENANT WITH THE ONE WHO CAN MAKE
[1:03:20] anything happen.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; You need healing in your body, start
[1:03:27] acting like
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; you're a son of God.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And before you know it, you'll be going
[1:03:35] around like Abraham confessing and up
[1:03:38] and walking around.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. an old man up and walking around
[1:03:42] claiming that you're a father of many
[1:03:44] nations. Hallelujah. And there you are
[1:03:47] on your cane just barely. Amen. Keeping
[1:03:49] your false teeth in as you're walking.
[1:03:51] But hey, footsteps his possession.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Footsteps his possession. What is it?
[1:03:56] God gave the promise. He was in covenant
[1:03:59] with God. And there was nothing going to
[1:04:00] keep him from that.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; HE BELIEVED GOD.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD.
[1:04:08] HE DIDN'T SIT AROUND WAITING FOR THE
[1:04:10] PROMISE TO HAPPEN BEFORE HE STARTED
[1:04:12] POSSESSING. HE WAS POSSESSING BECAUSE
[1:04:16] GOD MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU START POSSESSING HERE
[1:04:21] TONIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE THE
[1:04:23] PROMISE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE THE
[1:04:24] FULFILLMENT. YOU BELIEVE THAT PROMISE
[1:04:27] AND START CLAIMING GOD'S BLESSING. START
[1:04:30] CLAIMING GOD'S WORD. STAND UPON THUS
[1:04:33] SAYETH THE LORD.
[1:04:36] YOU'RE IN COVENANT WITH GOD.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; You stand upon that word.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; You start acting like it.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, glory to God. Amen.
[1:04:50] Before you know it, that old hand may be
[1:04:51] paralyzed, but you're working it every
[1:04:53] day.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're work. You're doing your
[1:04:56] best. You're going to make that finger
[1:04:58] move. Is that not what the prophet said?
[1:05:00] Amen. And then finally you get a little
[1:05:03] you get a little twitch and no one else
[1:05:04] sees it but you can feel it and you're
[1:05:06] said
[1:05:08] there it is. There it is. And before you
[1:05:11] know it you got a finger move. Before
[1:05:12] you know it you got two fingers moving.
[1:05:14] Before you know well praise the Lord.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I SAID WE'RE A COVENANT PEOPLE.
[1:05:18] THE COVENANT IS WITH HIS PEOPLE. SOMEONE
[1:05:22] SAY I'M A COVENANT PERSON.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:28] So covenant people,
[1:05:31] you look at things differently.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Your prayer is different.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Your study time is different.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Your
[1:05:41] message that you listen to is different.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; And your confession
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; that you listen to is different.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you have tied yourself to
[1:05:54] that promise. You have made it yours.
[1:05:58] Not the preacher making it his. You
[1:06:00] yourself. Well, glory to God.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke Lancaster making the promise
[1:06:07] yours.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's me. I'm the
[1:06:15] COVENANT PERSON. I'M THE ONE THAT GOD
[1:06:16] TOUCHED. I'M THE ONE THAT HAS RECEIVED
[1:06:18] THE HOLY GHOST. I'M THE ONE THAT GOD HAS
[1:06:21] COME TO. IF THE REST OF THE WORLD, AMEN,
[1:06:24] WERE TO GO TO HELL AND THERE WAS NO ONE
[1:06:26] ELSE BUT ONE PERSON TO MAKE THE RAPTURE,
[1:06:29] I WOULD BE THE ONE.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; SORRY.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; SORRY. That's just the way I believe it.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of attitude God wants.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; When when the boys were younger, y'all
[1:06:49] probably remember this. Um,
[1:06:52] Brother Forest Farmer, we were out at
[1:06:55] McDonald's and anyone knows Brother
[1:06:57] Forest Farmer? He's just a man of faith,
[1:06:59] you know, and and we love Brother
[1:07:01] Forest. You just I I just love tagging
[1:07:03] along because usually there's good
[1:07:05] things that happen when you're around
[1:07:06] Brother Forest. Hallelujah. And uh well,
[1:07:10] he hollers. We was at McDonald's out
[1:07:11] there at the old McDonald's and he
[1:07:13] hollered out and says,
[1:07:16] "Hey, hey, Brother Wendle." So I said,
[1:07:19] "Hey, brother Forest."
[1:07:22] He said, "I'm sorry, but God loves me
[1:07:25] more than he loves you."
[1:07:30] Everyone's going looking around
[1:07:32] thinking, and I said, "That's
[1:07:33] impossible. I'm his favorite son."
[1:07:37] He looked around there and he said,
[1:07:38] "Well, how could you be the favorite
[1:07:40] when God loves me more?" Amen. Now, now,
[1:07:44] now that that's that was just some going
[1:07:46] back and forth being cute. But you see,
[1:07:49] that's the kind of attitude we should
[1:07:50] all have,
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; If God's going to hear anyone's prayer,
[1:07:54] he's going to hear mine.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; What What kind OF AN ATTITUDE SHOULD YOU
[1:07:58] HAVE?
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; IF GOD'S GOING TO HEAR ANYONE'S PRAYERS,
[1:08:03] SIMEON SHOULD SAY, "IT'LL BE MINE."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; And then his buddy sat beside him
[1:08:08] saying, "No,
[1:08:10] I'm his favorite."
[1:08:12] THERE SHOULD BE THIS COVENANT YOU'VE GOT
[1:08:16] WITH GOD. AND I'M SO GLAD THAT GOD'S SO
[1:08:17] BIG THAT WE CAN ALL BE HIS FAVORITE. I'M
[1:08:20] SO GLAD THAT GOD GAVE US ALL THE
[1:08:22] COVENANT. AND HE'S JUST WANTING SOMEBODY
[1:08:25] TO START acting like it, believing him
[1:08:27] in that promise. Can you say amen? AMEN.
[1:08:31] GOD GAVE THAT PROMISE. BRING HIS WORD
[1:08:35] BACK to him. EVERYONE HEAR ME. GOD GAVE
[1:08:38] YOU THE PROMISE. HE WANTS YOU TO BRING
[1:08:41] HIS WORD BACK TO HIM.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; That's what Jehoshaphat done.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; We're not praying fears. We're not
[1:08:50] praying unbelief. We're not praying
[1:08:53] anything else. We've got an absolute
[1:08:56] amen. Can you say amen?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Now, Solomon is there. He's declaring.
[1:09:02] Then the 10th and 11th verse, he begins
[1:09:04] to start declaring, "Hey, Amen. and
[1:09:07] Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir and they
[1:09:10] they here they are. They're coming and
[1:09:13] ma'am, they're wanting to kill us. And
[1:09:15] Amen. It begins to tell him, "You the
[1:09:17] one that gave us the promise. You gave
[1:09:19] us the land. Amen. You're the one. We're
[1:09:22] the seed of Abraham. And you said it
[1:09:25] would be to the seed of Abraham." Amen.
[1:09:29] Thy friend forever. Here we are
[1:09:31] standing. And you've said when evil
[1:09:34] comes upon us as swore and night verse
[1:09:37] judgment and pestilence and famine and
[1:09:40] we stand before thy house in the in thy
[1:09:42] presence for thy name is in this house
[1:09:45] and we cry unto thee in our affliction
[1:09:48] then thou wilt hear and help. Now he's
[1:09:53] he's bringing it to I mean he's just
[1:09:54] HE'S JUST LAYING IT OUT there now. Here
[1:09:57] we are. Amen. He confesses. Amen. The
[1:10:02] 12th verse. Oh our God, wilt thou not
[1:10:04] judge them. We have no might against
[1:10:07] this great company that cometh against
[1:10:09] us, neither know we what to do, but our
[1:10:13] eyes are upon thee. And all Judas stood
[1:10:17] before the Lord with their little ones
[1:10:20] and their wives and their children. Oh,
[1:10:23] can you say amen? And what were they
[1:10:25] doing? They were bringing their petition
[1:10:29] before the Lord.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:31] It's in it's in faith. You know, just
[1:10:34] thinking of there in there in uh uh
[1:10:37] James 5 and I don't know somewhere on
[1:10:40] the 14th, 15th, 16th verse there. Amen.
[1:10:42] Where where where is you know he says if
[1:10:46] if there's any sick among you call for
[1:10:48] the elders of the church if he sin then
[1:10:51] let him pray. But then he but then he
[1:10:54] says he says somewhere in there the uh
[1:10:58] uh fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; avails much.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; The fervent prayer of a righteous man.
[1:11:10] But then he goes on down and he says and
[1:11:12] the prayer of faith shall save the sick.
[1:11:18] It's not how pathetic we can be.
[1:11:22] It's not how
[1:11:25] bad we can present our situation.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; It's in the way that we say, "I got a
[1:11:32] need and I know beyond any doubt that
[1:11:37] you've got my healing."
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; The prayer of faith shall
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; save the sick.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you want to
[1:11:50] shout.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; FOR THE EFFECTUAL, FERVENT PRAYER OF A
[1:11:54] RIGHTEOUS MAN, a believing man. How do
[1:11:58] you become righteous? Abraham believed
[1:12:01] God AND IT WAS IMPUTED UNTO HIM FOR
[1:12:04] RIGHTEOUSNESS. SO A FAITHFUL THE FERVENT
[1:12:08] PRAYER THE EFFECTUAL FERVENT PRAYER OF A
[1:12:10] RIGHTEOUS MAN ONE WHO BELIEVES God shall
[1:12:14] avail very much.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Well glory TO GOD.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; I SAID GLORY to God.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; I'M IN A TRIAL. THEN IT'S TIME TO GO TO
[1:12:24] prayer and pray like a RIGHTEOUS MAN.
[1:12:26] PRAY LIKE A BELIEVING MAN. PRAY LIKE A
[1:12:29] BELIEVING WOMAN. AND I DON'T YOU LEAVE
[1:12:31] UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT WHAT you what
[1:12:34] you have been asking for.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 and 18, sister Keys. Amen.
[1:12:42] Is another prayer scripture.
[1:12:45] AMEN. PRAYING ALWAYS WITH ALL PRAYER.
[1:12:49] And there's that word supplication
[1:12:50] again. Amen. And what is that
[1:12:52] supplication? that earnest request and
[1:12:56] petition to the one that you know has
[1:13:00] your answer.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Praying always with all prayer and
[1:13:03] supplication in the spirit, watching
[1:13:05] there unto with all perseverance and
[1:13:08] supplication for all the saints. Can you
[1:13:11] say amen? James 1:6, LET HIM ASK IN
[1:13:14] FAITH, nothing wavering. For he that
[1:13:18] waverth is like a wave of the sea driven
[1:13:20] with the wind and is tossed. For let not
[1:13:23] that man think that he shall receive
[1:13:25] anything of the Lord. A double-minded
[1:13:28] man is unstable in all of his way. So if
[1:13:31] we're going to be asking, he didn't say
[1:13:34] let him ask. I hope I hope this ain't
[1:13:36] too simple and hype. AMEN. LET HIM ASK
[1:13:39] in faith.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; THE EFFECTUAL FERVENT PRAYER OF A
[1:13:44] BELIEVING MAN AVALETH MUCH. LET HIM ask
[1:13:50] in faith, never wavering.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; AH, YOU'RE IN COVENANT WITH HIM.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; COME ON. AMEN.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You can doubt yourself, but don't doubt
[1:14:00] God.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, we're so thankful for that. Now
[1:14:10] I think here of Judah
[1:14:13] and um
[1:14:15] I thought it was interesting that here
[1:14:17] in this especially in this in this story
[1:14:20] that it was Judah that was that was
[1:14:24] having trouble
[1:14:26] and it was Judah if you were to if you
[1:14:30] were to look in the scripture
[1:14:33] and um
[1:14:36] and and there in the 19th verse.
[1:14:41] They they stood up to praise the Lord.
[1:14:43] This is 2 Chronicles 20 and 19. Such
[1:14:46] keys, if you just go with me as we skip
[1:14:48] down through some of this stuff. Amen.
[1:14:50] Um the Levites and the children of
[1:14:53] Corites. The these are the these are the
[1:14:56] ministers.
[1:14:57] Amen. The priest of the And and it and
[1:14:59] it says they stood up to praise the Lord
[1:15:02] God of Israel with a loud voice
[1:15:05] on high.
[1:15:07] And um uh and and and then we find the
[1:15:10] 20th verse that Jehoshaphat is saying,
[1:15:14] "Believe in the Lord your God and you
[1:15:16] shall be established and believe as
[1:15:18] prophets and you shall prosper."
[1:15:20] And then the 21st verse, if you'd want
[1:15:22] to put that up, Sister Keys. And when he
[1:15:24] had consulted with the people, he
[1:15:26] appointed singers unto the Lord, that
[1:15:30] they should praise the beauty of
[1:15:32] holiness as they went out before the
[1:15:35] army, and to say, "Praise the Lord,
[1:15:39] for his mercy endures forever." Yes.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And when they begin to sing and to
[1:15:47] praise,
[1:15:48] the Lord set ambushments against the
[1:15:51] children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir,
[1:15:54] and which were come against Judah, and
[1:15:58] they were smitten.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; They were smitten.
[1:16:04] Judah
[1:16:07] means praise. Did y'all know that? Judah
[1:16:09] means praise. as I was that was I was
[1:16:12] contemplating my thoughts here today and
[1:16:14] and going over in my mind
[1:16:17] Judah it when when God had first come to
[1:16:20] Judah and and give him his give him his
[1:16:23] promise it was it was uh uh Jacob that
[1:16:29] that there in in in Genesis 49 and 8 and
[1:16:34] and said Judah thou art he whom thy
[1:16:38] brothers brethren shall praise
[1:16:40] Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine
[1:16:43] enemies. Thy father's children shall bow
[1:16:46] down before thee. Judah is a lion's wel
[1:16:51] from the prey. My son, thou art gone. He
[1:16:55] stooped down. He's couched as a lion, as
[1:16:58] an old lion. Who shall arise him?
[1:17:02] Arouse him. The scepter shall not depart
[1:17:06] from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
[1:17:09] his feet until Shiloh come. Unto him
[1:17:13] shall the gathering of the people be.
[1:17:16] And and
[1:17:19] there even in in the book of Judges when
[1:17:21] they were going in to fight against the
[1:17:23] Canaanites there in Judges 1 and one.
[1:17:25] Now after the death of Joshua, it came
[1:17:27] to pass that the children of Israel
[1:17:28] asked the Lord, saying, "Who shall go up
[1:17:30] for us against the Canaanites first to
[1:17:33] fight against them?" And the Lord said,
[1:17:35] "Judah
[1:17:36] shall go up. Behold, I have delivered
[1:17:40] the land into his hand."
[1:17:44] Now that word Judah, Judah means praise.
[1:17:47] It means to give thanks to Law and
[1:17:50] praise to sing praises of.
[1:17:54] Judah also means to confess, to say the
[1:17:57] same thing as God says, to confess the
[1:18:00] name of God. Judah means to cast down,
[1:18:04] to shoot arrows, to throw down. Judah,
[1:18:08] it it's incredible that Judah
[1:18:13] were the people of praise.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; They were the people of praise.
[1:18:20] And it's incredible how that praise,
[1:18:23] confession,
[1:18:25] and casting down
[1:18:28] all falls under the same
[1:18:31] meaning of the word Judah. It's
[1:18:35] incredible
[1:18:37] that the mighty angel who has come down
[1:18:41] is from the line of the tribe of Judah.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:47] The lamb, sacrificial lamb is also the
[1:18:52] lamb.
[1:18:54] The one who died on Calvary has come
[1:18:57] back in our generation as the mighty
[1:19:00] conqueror.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; To conquer death. The lion of the tribe
[1:19:06] of Judah. That is none other than the
[1:19:09] mighty angel coming down with an open
[1:19:11] book.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:19:15] Confession
[1:19:17] and casting down. Somebody say
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; praise.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Confession
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; and casting down. Look it up in your
[1:19:24] Strong's concordance. Praise
[1:19:28] confession
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; and casting down. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:19:35] When everything is going wrong. Amen.
[1:19:37] And as brother Kobe sings that song,
[1:19:38] when everything is gone wrong
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; and my back's against the wall,
[1:19:45] Satan's throwing it on strong
[1:19:48] and whatever. But then what else do what
[1:19:51] is this? What the main part of this song
[1:19:52] I want you to get? I just throw up my
[1:19:55] hands
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; and start praising the Lord.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I can't give up because I stand
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; word his covenant.
[1:20:07] When
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; he comes down and inhabits my praise, I
[1:20:13] got a dynamite plan. Satan just can't
[1:20:16] stand
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; when I throw up my hand.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:20:24] Come on.
[1:20:28] Are you GOING TO MILK THAT TRIAL YOU'VE
[1:20:30] GOT? ARE YOU GOING TO SIT THERE AND JUST
[1:20:32] ARE THAT LITTLE HURDLE THAT GOD'S GIVEN
[1:20:34] YOU? Are you going
[1:20:37] are are you going to make thistles and
[1:20:40] briars and thorns to grow on that hill
[1:20:42] by all of your tears? Are you going to
[1:20:45] get up get your bulldozing faith out and
[1:20:47] just bulldoze the hill? Or better than
[1:20:49] that, why don't you just jump over the
[1:20:51] hill?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:56] See,
[1:20:58] you can God's not given us this sit in
[1:21:00] any situation in our lives for us to be
[1:21:03] in the migrs or to bow to it. Don't let
[1:21:08] the enemy ever see fear in your eyes.
[1:21:12] Don't let him hear negative in your in
[1:21:15] your mouth. Don't give your thoughts
[1:21:18] over to him because the prophets done
[1:21:21] came in this generation to tell US THE
[1:21:25] GREATEST BATTLE ever going to be FOUGHT
[1:21:27] IS RIGHT THERE IN YOUR MIND AND WHATEVER
[1:21:29] DECISION YOU MAKE IN YOUR MIND IS GOING
[1:21:32] TO AFFECT YOUR BODY.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROPHET said a the RIGHT
[1:21:37] CONFESSION WILL BRING YOUR BODY UNDER
[1:21:42] its control.
[1:21:44] Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; I got a dynamite plan Satan just can't
[1:21:49] stand.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; So, here is where now I I love this. I
[1:22:00] got another scripture that I that I that
[1:22:01] I've thrown in here somewhere. Let me
[1:22:02] find it. Hallelujah.
[1:22:06] Amen. Fixing to close now. They're
[1:22:09] they're in Zechariah. Now, God's using
[1:22:11] Judah again. Amen. God's using Judah
[1:22:14] again. And this is Zechariah 10:1. And
[1:22:17] and and and Zechariah has a lot of good
[1:22:19] things about us. But mine anger was
[1:22:22] kindled against the shepherds, and I
[1:22:23] punished the goats. For the Lord of
[1:22:26] hosts had visited his flock, the house
[1:22:28] of Judah, and hath made them as his
[1:22:33] goodly horse
[1:22:35] in battle.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Now, what's a goodly horse in battle?
[1:22:39] That's a strong horse. Right.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; God's saying God's saying I have chosen
[1:22:45] Judah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; My anointing
[1:22:48] is going to ride.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I have called Judah and I'm going to use
[1:22:55] Judah as my goodly horse. Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] Amen. Goodly horse. He's going to ride
[1:23:04] you. He's going to ride. Now here we are
[1:23:07] in in the time of battle AND IT SAYS OUT
[1:23:09] OF JUDAH CAME FORTH THE CORNER. This is
[1:23:13] this is Zechariah 10:2. Out of Judah
[1:23:16] CAME FORTH THE CORNER. OUT OF Judah come
[1:23:20] the nail. Out of him the battlebowl.
[1:23:24] Out of Judah every oppressor
[1:23:29] together.
[1:23:31] They shall be as mighty men which tread
[1:23:35] down their enemies in the mire of the
[1:23:37] streets in the battle. THEY SHALL FIGHT
[1:23:41] FOR the because the Lord is with THEM
[1:23:44] AND THE RIDERS ON HOUSES ON horses shall
[1:23:47] be confounded. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Now, what am I trying to say? Judah's
[1:23:53] not listening to his own reasoning.
[1:23:56] Although there is they are they are in
[1:23:59] battle. They are distressed. They are in
[1:24:02] desperation.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; But they're not looking to their
[1:24:05] weapons. They're not looking to their
[1:24:07] ability. They're coming with the weapon
[1:24:09] that God predestinated them. Their their
[1:24:13] name was praise. We come from that great
[1:24:19] royal seed of Judah. OUR
[1:24:24] HIGH PRIEST COMES from the royal seed of
[1:24:27] Judah. Now they were all say you WHAT
[1:24:29] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT JUDAH? It Aaron
[1:24:32] didn't come from Judah. But when God
[1:24:34] come, he bypassed their ironic
[1:24:36] priesthood and he says we're going to
[1:24:38] come after that of Melzdc. We're going
[1:24:41] to come we're Hallelujah. AMEN. WHEN GOD
[1:24:45] WANTED TO SHOW WHO HE WAS, HE SAID, "The
[1:24:48] line of the tribe of Judah has
[1:24:53] prevailed." Somebody say, "The line OF
[1:24:56] THE TRIBE OF JUDAH HAS PREVAILED."
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; The seed OF JUDAH HAS PREVAILED.
[1:25:07] SOMEBODY SAY, "I'M GOING TO PRAISE.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO CONFESS. I'M GOING TO CAST
[1:25:13] MY DEVIL DOWN IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:26] Now,
[1:25:30] the Bible says that they rose up early
[1:25:34] in the morning. They appointed the
[1:25:36] singers
[1:25:38] and they went out to say, "Praise the
[1:25:40] Lord for his mercy endureth forever."
[1:25:44] Amen. 2 Chronicles 20 and 22. And they
[1:25:46] begin to sing and to praise and the Lord
[1:25:49] set ambushments against the children of
[1:25:51] Ammon, Moab, and Mass.
[1:25:54] And the children of Ammon and Moab stood
[1:25:56] up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir
[1:25:58] and utter began to slay and destroy
[1:26:00] them. And when they had made an end of
[1:26:03] the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped
[1:26:05] to destroy another. And when Judah came
[1:26:08] toward the watchtower in the wilderness,
[1:26:11] they looked unto the multitude,
[1:26:16] and behold, they were dead bodies fallen
[1:26:20] to the earth, and none escaped. And when
[1:26:24] Jehoshaphat and his people come to take
[1:26:27] away the spoil of them, they found among
[1:26:30] them in abundance both riches with the
[1:26:33] dead bodies and precious jewels which
[1:26:36] they stripped off them for themselves
[1:26:39] more than they could carry away. They
[1:26:42] were three days in gathering of the
[1:26:44] spoil and it was so much. Well, someone
[1:26:46] shout hallelujah.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And on the fourth day they
[1:26:50] assembled themselves in the valley of
[1:26:52] Baraka. For there they blessed the Lord.
[1:26:56] Therefore the name of the place was
[1:26:59] called the valley of Baraka unto this
[1:27:02] day. Then they returned every man of
[1:27:05] Judah and Jerusalem and Jehoshaphat in
[1:27:08] the forefront with them to go again to
[1:27:11] Jerusalem with joy. For the Lord had
[1:27:14] made them to rejoice over their enemies.
[1:27:20] SOMEONE SHOUT YES.
[1:27:24] SOMEONE SHOUT YES.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; OH, WE CAN DO BETTER THAN I KNOW. I KNOW
[1:27:29] IT'S A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, BUT SOMEBODY
[1:27:30] SHOUT YES.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; AND THEY COME TO JERUSALEM WITH
[1:27:35] SULTURIES AND HARPS AND TRUMPETS unto
[1:27:39] the house of the Lord. And the fear of
[1:27:42] GOD WAS ON ALL THE KINGDOMS of those
[1:27:45] countries when they heard that the Lord
[1:27:48] had fought against their enemies of
[1:27:50] Israel. Hallelujah. I just want to say
[1:27:53] thank you, Lord.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I'm so glad that it
[1:27:59] wasn't the line of the tribe of Gad or
[1:28:02] the line of the tribe of But it was the
[1:28:04] line of the tribe of praise.
[1:28:10] the line of the tribe. And it's it's so
[1:28:13] incredible that all three of those
[1:28:14] virtues that come underneath that name,
[1:28:16] a name represents something. It means
[1:28:17] something. It means something. Amen.
[1:28:21] Hallelujah. But when God when he chose
[1:28:23] to be the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:28:27] the tribe of praise.
[1:28:30] Hallelujah.
[1:28:32] And it was gi Judah that went into the
[1:28:35] battle and destroyed.
[1:28:39] It was Judah
[1:28:42] means confession to say the same thing.
[1:28:44] And he says, "Listen, I am I am the lion
[1:28:50] of the tribe.
[1:28:53] I've got a tribe.
[1:28:55] And whatsoever things you confess,
[1:29:00] I will confess. I'm the high priest of
[1:29:03] your confession."
[1:29:06] And then the prophet would come in and
[1:29:07] say, 'N now it's important that you say
[1:29:09] the right words.
[1:29:11] It's important.
[1:29:13] It's important for Hattie Wright to say
[1:29:16] that ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:29:19] It's important today for you and I to
[1:29:22] come in covenant, come in come in
[1:29:25] relation at one with God's promise.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; I say God can't lie.
[1:29:37] I say God can't lie.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; I I I say the things that I have prayed
[1:29:42] over and confessed over and just kept
[1:29:44] before God. Amen. God has said I listen
[1:29:47] when it looked impossible for for
[1:29:49] certain things and I just kept on
[1:29:51] praying and calling out to God and
[1:29:53] calling out to God and calling even in
[1:29:55] the time when I just felt like all hope
[1:29:58] was gone. Then God comes right on in
[1:30:00] right at the nick of time. Amen. And
[1:30:03] makes it to pass and then answers my
[1:30:05] prayer and I say, "Oh, God, how did this
[1:30:07] happen? I don't know how it happened.
[1:30:09] God done it. It was supernatural.
[1:30:12] God wants it supernatural. If you can do
[1:30:15] it yourself, dummy." Amen. Then you
[1:30:17] don't need God.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; But God's got it to where he want where
[1:30:26] he where you're going to have to rely on
[1:30:28] him. Well, praise the Lord. Well, I
[1:30:31] believe I'll praise the Lord while I
[1:30:34] have a chance.
[1:30:38] I believe I'll praise the Lord while I
[1:30:41] have a chance.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Praise him all night long. I believe
[1:30:52] I'll praise the Lord while I have a
[1:30:55] chance.
[1:30:57] Welcome.
[1:30:59] Praise
[1:31:00] praising him.
[1:31:04] Well, I feel like praising praising him.
[1:31:10] I'm going to praise him in the morning.
[1:31:13] I'm going to praise him all night long.
[1:31:17] Well, pre like praise.
[1:31:21] Oh
[1:31:22] yeah. Now, why don't you praise the Lord
[1:31:25] while you got in jail?
[1:31:29] Hey, why don't you praise the Lord while
[1:31:32] you've got a chance?
[1:31:36] Praise him in the morning.
[1:31:39] Praise him all day long.
[1:31:42] Why don't you praise the Lord while you
[1:31:45] got a chance?
[1:31:47] Well, I feel like loving.
[1:31:54] Oh, I feel like loving.
[1:31:59] I'm going to love him.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to love him.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Well, I feel
[1:32:11] Oh,

[1:32:25] Praise him in the morning.

[1:34:50] God. We don't we don't want to live
[1:34:51] hypocritical before God.
[1:34:54] But I want to tell you, in order to
[1:34:57] prevail,
[1:34:59] in order to stomp our enemy, it's going
[1:35:02] to require fighting.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Fighting.
[1:35:06] Sometimes it leaves us bruised.
[1:35:08] Sometimes it leaves us wounds.
[1:35:11] It does. But that doesn't mean you're
[1:35:13] not fighting.
[1:35:15] You got to fight.
[1:35:18] The greatest thing that we could ever do
[1:35:19] is question the covenant, our covenant
[1:35:23] with God.
[1:35:25] We got to get it past that. This the age
[1:35:28] of adoption.
[1:35:30] This is the age where we know.
[1:35:32] We know that. We know.
[1:35:34] And if you're not in covenant with him,
[1:35:37] all it requires is baptism of the Holy
[1:35:40] Ghost. The Holy Ghost settles that in
[1:35:44] your heart. Then the word begins to come
[1:35:46] and you say, "That's me. That's me.
[1:35:50] That's me."
[1:35:52] Amen. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:35:56] Hallelujah.
[1:35:58] It was
[1:36:00] It was the little girl that that she
[1:36:02] she's a little girl back then. She's
[1:36:04] She's grown. I guess she's probably
[1:36:06] married now. What's that girl's name
[1:36:07] that lost all of her hair?
[1:36:11] Huh? Mariah, is she married?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Did Yeah. Y'all remember that?
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; He There she was. She'd come to camp
[1:36:19] with her hat on. She didn't have no
[1:36:22] hair. She She was wearing a little
[1:36:24] beanie cuz she didn't have no hair.
[1:36:28] Hallelujah.
[1:36:33] But she would carry she would carry uh
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; bobby pins.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Bobby pins.
[1:36:41] She'd carry bobby pins with her.
[1:36:44] They'd ask why why you carrying those
[1:36:46] bobby pins? She says cuz God's healed
[1:36:49] me. Doctor, it was some kind of a
[1:36:52] disease and there was no cure for it.
[1:36:54] Doctor said it's just going to be that
[1:36:55] way. She had lost she had lost it in her
[1:36:57] I mean she had lost she didn't have no
[1:36:59] hair.
[1:37:03] And there she come through that prayer
[1:37:05] line that one time. Now, she had been
[1:37:06] going years and then she come through
[1:37:07] that prayer line
[1:37:10] and she had the bobby pins in her hand.
[1:37:16] That was the prayer line that God healed
[1:37:18] her.
[1:37:20] And now she's got all that beautiful
[1:37:22] hair. She's a mama today.
[1:37:25] Isn't that just wonderful?
[1:37:35] So we we look at those things, we see
[1:37:39] these things and we believe them. We
[1:37:43] trust what God has to say about us.
[1:37:48] I think every one of us can look back in
[1:37:50] our lives and we can see what God has
[1:37:53] has done for us.
[1:37:57] Is that right?
[1:37:59] Hallelujah.
[1:38:05] Don't remember Mary,
[1:38:08] our choir leader
[1:38:11] that

[1:38:43] and then she just, you know, just just
[1:38:45] her respect for the things of God.
[1:38:49] And I had given her a hard time.
[1:38:52] I was always picking on Sister Mary when
[1:38:54] she's growing up. Still do occasionally.
[1:39:00] But this time here, I was I saying

[1:39:06] And uh Mary welled up tears, big old
[1:39:10] tears. She said, "I'm sorry." Or
[1:39:12] something like that. And I and I felt
[1:39:14] like so much like a heel. I just I felt
[1:39:17] so bad. Oh, no. I'm sorry.
[1:39:20] And do you know the next day she woke up

[1:57:43] Yes, brother Caleb.
[1:57:47] And um
[1:57:50] we're going to the memorial and and um
[1:57:56] we just ask for God's
[1:57:59] blessings upon him.
[1:58:03] Brother, brother Mitch has sort of been
[1:58:05] a little sort of no one has understood
[1:58:08] him on his in his family being the only
[1:58:13] believer
[1:58:15] and um so things can be a little bit
[1:58:18] tough and especially in this
[1:58:20] time right now. But let's just ask God's
[1:58:23] blessings upon you, Father,
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; as we come and
[1:58:30] laying our hands upon brother Mitches,
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Sister Titha, Brother Caleb.
[1:58:41] Lord, we stand for Robert and Bri,
[1:58:46] Naomi Aaron.
[1:58:50] I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit
[1:58:54] would just rest upon them in a real
[1:58:56] special way. Lord,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I ask that your blessings would be with
[1:59:02] them,
[1:59:04] that you would protect them and keep
[1:59:06] them.
[1:59:08] I'm asking, Lord, that when they get to
[1:59:10] Seattle, Lord,
[1:59:12] with all of the family functions and the
[1:59:14] things that's going to be going on, I I
[1:59:18] pray, Lord, that your presence would go
[1:59:22] before them, Lord, and let the family
[1:59:26] see Jesus in them and see a reality of
[1:59:29] this message in this family.
[1:59:33] I pray Lord that you would comfort every
[1:59:35] heart
[1:59:38] that you would save. Lord, you know
[1:59:40] exactly
[1:59:41] who your children are. And we're just
[1:59:43] asking that you would bring all of your
[1:59:45] children. May may their lives be such an
[1:59:48] example that there'll be people giving
[1:59:49] their lives to you, Father.
[1:59:53] And Lord, rest upon them and be with
[1:59:55] them. Father,
[1:59:57] I ask that you would be with Brother
[2:00:00] Mitch's mama.
[2:00:02] Lord, that you would strengthen her,
[2:00:05] the siblings, Lord.
[2:00:08] We thank you for it,
[2:00:11] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[2:00:14] Amen and amen.
[2:00:17] Thank you for it, Lord.

[2:00:25] prayers when you guys go. I know it's a
[2:00:28] know it's a tough deal.

[2:00:45] Amen. God bless.
[2:00:49] We let you dismiss yourselves now as you
[2:00:51] all go. God bless you.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; When everything falls apart,
[2:00:59] just praise his name.
[2:01:02] When you have broken hearts,
[2:01:07] just raise your hands and say,
[2:01:11] "Lord, you're all I need." Yes, Lord.
[2:01:15] You're everything to me.
[2:01:19] You can take the pain away. God bless
[2:01:23] you.

[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; "Great
[2:01:46] is he
[2:01:49] that is within me."
