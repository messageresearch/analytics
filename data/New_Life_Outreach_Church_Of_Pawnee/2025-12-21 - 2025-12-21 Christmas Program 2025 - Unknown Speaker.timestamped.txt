[11:32] Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your
[11:33] attention? On behalf of New Life
[11:36] Outreach Church's Sunday school classes,
[11:38] we thank you for being a part of our
[11:40] 2025 Christmas program. We are asking
[11:43] for your own safety as we begin our
[11:45] journey to keep your hands and legs in
[11:47] the pews at all times. for we will be
[11:50] having a group of soldiers, a cow, a
[11:53] donkey, and some adorable sheep walking
[11:55] through the middle. Also, when we dim
[11:58] the lights, please continue to stay
[12:00] quiet. We will be playing audio clips
[12:02] during this time. So, please sit back
[12:04] and enjoy the show.
[12:11] Our story begins one beautiful day when
[12:15] Mary, the mother of Jesus, was just a
[12:17] little girl.
[12:19] for all of your help with the chores
[12:21] today.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; You're welcome, mama. But I kind of wish
[12:24] I could have just played with my toys.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; I know you do. But it's good to learn to
[12:27] push aside our plans in order to be a
[12:30] blessing unto others. I know someday the
[12:32] Lord may use you in a very special way.
[12:35] Even if it's not the plan he had in
[12:36] mind, he has always been willing to
[12:38] surrender our lives to whatever class
[12:40] path he has planned for us. I know he
[12:42] must surely have something great in
[12:44] store for you.
[13:23] Now, several years have passed and Mary
[13:26] has grown up to be a beautiful young
[13:28] lady who has caught the eye of a local
[13:30] carpenter.
[13:36] Shalom.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Good evening, sir. May I come in and
[13:38] speak with you for a few moments?
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Can I have a seat?
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, hello, Joseph.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; What's on your mind today?
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Man, it sure has been a beautiful day.
[13:52] Doubt.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; It has.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Really like the weather like this.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; It's been nice.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; I've been working a lot lately.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; You can have her, Joseph.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; You mean it.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; You're a highly respected man in our
[14:04] community. We know you'll take care of
[14:06] her. You have a blessing.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. I promise to always
[14:09] provide for her and love her with all my
[14:11] heart.
[14:14] And as custom was that after service is
[14:18] over. Why
[14:20] he would go home with her sometimes to
[14:23] her home
[14:25] for where her home was just across the
[14:29] hill where Joseph the carpenter was
[14:32] building a special little house.
[14:37] You know, it had to have that little
[14:39] special touch to it because it was the
[14:43] one he was going to bring his little
[14:46] bride to. The doors had to shut just
[14:50] perfect. The windows had to be plum
[14:54] for that was where he was to spend his
[14:57] life with his little wife.
[15:02] And after the noon meal, they would go
[15:05] out on the front porch perhaps and look
[15:08] across towards that little home and
[15:11] dream of the time that when they would
[15:14] be together, happy living at the house
[15:17] and how the roses would be around the
[15:20] windows and so forth.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; This seemed like a strange sermon today,
[15:27] Mary. What did you think?
[15:29] &gt;&gt; You know, I heard the rabbi say that
[15:31] this great God that brought us here and
[15:33] made us what we are today doesn't really
[15:35] have to do a thing for us now like he
[15:37] did then. But I've I've kind of been
[15:40] thinking that if this great God was so
[15:42] great in the days of our fathers and our
[15:44] grandfathers, then why isn't he just the
[15:46] same great God today?
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Well, Mary, I believe God's the same as
[15:49] he's always been. We can read some
[15:51] scripture to see where he's leading us.
[15:52] Is there anything you've been reading
[15:53] lately?
[15:54] &gt;&gt; I read in Isaiah about a son being born
[15:58] that I just really didn't understand.
[16:05] For unto us a child is born, unto us a
[16:08] son is given, and the government shall
[16:10] be upon his shoulder, and his name shall
[16:12] be called Wonderful Counselor, the
[16:14] mighty God, the everlasting father, the
[16:17] prince of peace.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; Who do you think the prophet was
[16:20] speaking of?
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Well, Mary, I believe the prophet is
[16:23] speaking of the Messiah that is to come.
[16:25] And that's why we stay true to Jehovah
[16:27] and not mix with other nations because
[16:29] one day Messiah will be among us.
[16:55] The very next morning, Mary was walking
[16:58] along the side of the street as the sun
[17:00] was rising. Usually, the women would go
[17:03] to the public well a little later in the
[17:05] day to get their water. But somehow Mary
[17:08] was led to go early that morning.
[17:13] As she walked along
[17:15] thinking about the things she and Joseph
[17:18] had spoken of the day before,
[17:21] she felt a strange feeling around her.
[17:24] As she moved along and she raised her
[17:27] head again, there stood this great light
[17:29] before her.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Hail Mary, blessed art thou among women.
[17:33] Fear not, for thou sh favor with God.
[17:35] Behold, thou shalt conceive on thy womb,
[17:37] bring forth a son, shall call his name
[17:39] Jesus.
[17:41] But but my Lord, how how can these
[17:43] things be?
[17:44] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit shall overshadow thee,
[17:46] and the holy thing that shall be born
[17:48] from you will be called the Son of God.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Quickly testifying that she was going to
[18:00] have this baby. How is she going to have
[18:03] it? She's never known a man. There's
[18:06] never been such that ever happened.
[18:09] But she just took the word OF THE LORD
[18:11] AT WHAT it meant and begin to rejoice.
[18:16] If we could just do that,
[18:20] that's the only thing.
[18:23] That's what God loves.
[18:26] That's the only way to get RIGHT WITH
[18:29] GOD IS TAKE HIM AT his word.
[18:34] That's the only way that there is to
[18:36] please God. Take his word.
[18:40] Don't trust your knowledge.
[18:43] You'll reason.
[18:46] How can it be done? It cannot be done.
[18:49] When you reason, then you lose the
[18:52] victory.
[18:54] WE MUST CAST DOWN reasoning
[18:58] and believe what God has said to be the
[19:01] truth.
[19:04] Mary took him at his word
[19:07] and change the whole COURSE OF NATURAL
[19:10] LIFE for her.
[19:13] And he'll change the course of your life
[19:16] tonight if you'll take him at his word.
[19:21] If you are a sinner, he'll straighten
[19:24] that crooked life of yours out.
[19:28] If you're bound and immortal, HE'LL MAKE
[19:32] YOU AS PURE AS A LILY.
[19:35] If you'll just take him at his word,
[19:40] that vile conscience of sin that makes
[19:43] you look at immoral things and use the
[19:47] name of the Lord in vain
[19:49] have tempering up the fight above all.
[19:53] He'll change that course of life for you
[19:57] and make you a new creature in his son
[20:00] Christ Jesus by just taking him at his
[20:03] word.
[20:07] As our journey continues,
[20:09] we see Mary traveling to her cousin
[20:12] Elizabeth's house. Elizabeth had never
[20:15] been able to have children, but the same
[20:18] angel had told her that she was also
[20:20] with child.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, look. It's my cousin Mary. I've
[20:24] never seen her so beautiful in all my
[20:25] life. Look how happy she looks.
[20:29] I'm coming. I'm coming.
[20:34] Hi.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Hi.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[20:38] &gt;&gt; why are you so happy? Is it because you
[20:39] and Joseph were to be married?
[20:41] &gt;&gt; No, not yet.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Why are you happy then? Is it because
[20:45] I'm mother?
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Um, I mean, yes. Uh,
[20:50] no. Okay, that's kind of part of it. I'm
[20:52] really happy.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; I've been hate hiding myself for six
[20:54] months now. And I'm just a little
[20:56] worried, Mary, because the baby has not
[20:59] yet moved. I'm just a little bothered.
[21:02] Okay, I've got something to tell you.
[21:05] I'm going to be mother, too.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Didn't you just tell me you and Joseph
[21:09] aren't married?
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; And you're to be a mother?
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[21:18] &gt;&gt; no. No. Okay. Okay. So, the other day I
[21:21] was on my way to the well and the same
[21:24] angel that came to Zachariah came to me
[21:26] and said that I was to I was to bring
[21:27] forth a son knowing no man I should call
[21:29] his name Jesus.
[21:32] Why am I so favorite? That the mother of
[21:34] my Messiah would come as soon as you
[21:37] spake his name. My baby leaps in joy for
[21:40] my in my belly for joy. Truly nothing is
[21:42] impossible for God.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; You were the word of the
[21:54] one with God the Lord
[21:58] high.
[22:03] Your hidden glory in creation
[22:08] now revealed in you are Christ.
[22:14] What a beautiful name it is.
[22:18] What a beautiful name [singing] it is.
[22:22] The name of Jesus
[22:26] Christ my king.
[22:30] What a beautiful name [singing] it is.
[22:34] Nothing compares to this.
[22:37] What a beautiful name it [singing] is.
[22:41] The name of Jesus.
[22:45] You didn't want heaven.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; You didn't want heaven [singing]
[22:50] without us.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; So Jesus, you [singing] brought heaven
[22:57] down.
[23:01] My sin was [singing]
[23:03] your love.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; What could separate [singing]
[23:11] us now?
[23:13] What a wonderful name it [singing] is.
[23:17] What a wonderful name it is.
[23:21] The name of [singing] Jesus
[23:25] Christ, my king.
[23:29] What a wonderful name [singing] it is.
[23:33] Nothing compares to this.
[23:36] What a wonderful name it [singing] is.
[23:39] The name of Jesus.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Once Mary arrives back home, she begins
[23:49] to prepare for the baby's arrival. We
[23:52] find her heading to the market to gather
[23:54] some things she was needing.
[23:58] Do you really believe that an angel
[24:00] brought you a message that you yourself
[24:03] will bring for the Messiah?
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, I believe with all my heart.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; It seems so impossible to believe.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't know how, but I know
[24:11] that God has chosen me and I know that
[24:14] he will fulfill his word.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that Mary he is carrying a child
[24:20] at a little log? Mary claims that the
[24:23] angel told her that she's came the
[24:25] Messiah.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Is she really crazy enough to believe
[24:28] that message she said she heard?
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Surely the Messiah wouldn't choose
[24:32] somebody as lowly as her to fulfill his
[24:34] prophecy.
[24:43] By the cre of the emperor Caesar
[24:45] Augustus, it has been resolved that a
[24:48] census be held in the entire world. All
[24:50] citizens return to their ancestral home
[24:53] to be registrated is the will of the
[24:55] emperor.
[25:35] Now when Joseph heard the news of the
[25:38] decree, he was concerned about Mary
[25:41] traveling in her condition.
[25:44] But Mary assured him that she had been
[25:46] given a sacred promise and that this
[25:49] baby would be born to save God's people
[25:51] from their sins.
[25:53] She knew she would find the strength to
[25:55] endure the journey. Although it wouldn't
[25:58] be easy and there would be many
[26:00] difficulties along the way. She reminded
[26:03] Joseph that they weren't the only family
[26:05] that would be traveling.
[26:07] There would be many others along the
[26:09] road that could help them if they had
[26:11] need.
[26:14] Mary and Joseph had now traveled for
[26:17] several days,
[26:19] and due to the many stops along the way
[26:21] so that Mary could regain her strength,
[26:24] they had fallen behind the rest of the
[26:26] group.
[26:28] That evening, when they had reached the
[26:31] top of the hill that overlooked
[26:32] Bethlehem,
[26:34] Joseph could see the town was already
[26:36] crowded and begin to wonder if they
[26:38] would ever find a place to stay.
[26:41] Mary had been in pain throughout that
[26:42] day, and he was thinking that maybe the
[26:45] baby may even come that very night. As
[26:48] he was looking around, he noticed a
[26:50] strange sight.
[26:52] A star bigger than he had ever seen
[26:54] before hung right over Bethlehem.
[26:58] When he mentioned it to Mary, she said
[27:00] it had stood out to her as well, and she
[27:03] had been watching it since the sun went
[27:05] down. She felt very strange, like
[27:07] something was about to happen.
[27:10] So they continued into town and begin to
[27:14] search for a place to stay.
[27:16] But as Joseph had feared with the amount
[27:19] of people that had come into Bethlehem,
[27:22] they were having a hard time finding a
[27:25] room in the inn.
[27:28] I'm sorry. There are no rooms available.
[27:32] Okay, thank you.
[27:34] Wait, it's not the most comfortable, but
[27:37] you can stay in my barn for the night.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[28:05] And isn't he just perfect?
[28:08] &gt;&gt; The angel's message was right, Joseph.
[28:10] We believed and prepared for this moment
[28:12] to come, and God kept his word.
[28:15] Everything we've been through, all the
[28:16] ridicule, doubts, and struggles along
[28:18] the journey has all been worth it just
[28:21] to see him born through me.
[28:42] Jesus.
[28:47] Jesus.
[28:52] Jesus,
[28:54] there's [music and singing]
[28:55] just something
[28:58] about
[29:01] that name.
[29:07] He's my master, [music]
[29:09] [singing]
[29:11] Savior,
[29:14] Jesus.
[29:16] [singing]
[29:19] Oh, like the fragrance [music]
[29:24] after
[29:26] the rain. [singing and music]
[29:33] Oh Jesus,
[29:36] Jesus,
[29:39] Jesus.
[29:44] Oh, let all heaven
[29:48] and earth
[29:51] proclaim.
[29:54] [singing]
[29:57] For kings [music]
[29:59] [singing]
[30:00] of kingdoms
[30:03] will all
[30:05] pass away.
[30:08] God, there's [music and singing]
[30:09] something
[30:12] about
[30:15] [music]
[30:15] &gt;&gt; that name.
[30:17] Once again [singing] now. Jesus.
[30:20] Oh Jesus. [music]
[30:24] Jesus. [singing]
[30:27] Jesus.
[30:30] [music]
[30:32] Oh, there's [singing] just something
[30:36] about
[30:39] that [music] name. [singing]
[30:44] &gt;&gt; He is my [singing and music] master,
[30:48] Savior.
[30:51] Jesus. [singing]
[30:55] Oh, like a fragrance [singing]
[31:00] after
[31:02] the rain.
[31:07] Oh Jesus,
[31:10] [music]
[31:12] Jesus, [singing]
[31:15] Jesus.
[31:19] Oh, let [singing] all heaven [music]
[31:23] and earth
[31:26] proclaim. [music]
[31:29] [singing]
[31:32] For kings
[31:35] and kingdoms
[31:38] will all [singing and music]
[31:41] pass away.
[31:44] But there's something
[31:47] about
[31:57] Saints of God, we must never settle for
[32:00] anything less
[32:04] than the new birth.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about an oldfashioned
[32:10] experience of God's life in our souls.
[32:13] [applause]
[32:16] the same life in our souls as it
[32:18] happened in the womb of Mary.
[32:21] [applause and cheering]
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. What an experience. The day that
[32:25] God overshadows your soul
[32:29] &gt;&gt; and you and be God becomes one. I want
[32:33] you to think about it. when the pillar
[32:35] of fire that once descended upon the Old
[32:38] Testament tabernacle
[32:40] coming down upon that little teenage
[32:43] girl, that teenage girl by the name of
[32:46] Mary and God would then create his own
[32:50] blood cell in her womb.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Now, now I want you to think about that
[32:55] in her own belly. [applause]
[32:57] And Mary's baby boy was truly God's very
[33:01] own son.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; God living in a human body. And all of
[33:07] God dwelt in the body of Jesus.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus would be the first the first human
[33:15] being to ever Amen. be without sin. And
[33:19] I can imagine Mary regularly attending
[33:23] the synagogue or church today and on the
[33:26] Sabbath. And she loved to read her Bible
[33:28] in the devotions and and and and she had
[33:31] read of the promises of a virgin given
[33:34] birth to the body of God and that his
[33:38] name would be called Wonderful
[33:41] Counselor,
[33:42] Prince of Peace,
[33:45] Everlasting Father.
[33:48] Amen. [applause]
[33:49] She had this crazy longing in her heart.
[33:52] Mary, could you imagine as she's reading
[33:55] it there and she had THIS THIS THIS
[33:58] CRAZY LONGING, AMEN. to be that girl
[34:02] &gt;&gt; there? THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS as
[34:05] as she would spend much time on her
[34:07] knees in prayer and she thought
[34:09] throughout the day asking God, "Let it
[34:12] be me. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE to use a
[34:16] virgin girl, let it be me. Amen. Did you
[34:21] know that that is the way that God
[34:23] usually works? When he has a special
[34:26] purpose for somebody, he begins to put
[34:30] holy desires within the heart of the one
[34:34] that he wants to feel.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; That's the way he wants to do it.
[34:38] Hallelujah. He creates that craving in
[34:42] in their heart to want his promise to be
[34:45] lived through you.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; And he is the author and the finisher of
[34:51] our expectations.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; God gives expectation IN OUR HEART. HOW
[34:57] MANY WANTS GOD TO USE YOU all here
[34:59] tonight? [cheering]
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I want y'all to think
[35:04] about it. MARY GAVE BIRTH TO JESUS, THE
[35:07] BODY OF THE INVISIBLE GOD. Oh my. Amen.
[35:12] His actions proved that he was more than
[35:15] a normal human being.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; He healed the sick.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; He raised Lazarus from the dead. HE
[35:22] TURNED THE WATER INTO WINE.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; And he went about doing the works of
[35:26] God.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And no one could dispute that God was
[35:30] living in Jesus.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[35:36] &gt;&gt; But now I can hear you say,
[35:39] &gt;&gt; I can hear someone in here say, "Now,
[35:41] pastor, what about me?
[35:44] &gt;&gt; I have a longing, too.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; I really desire for God to use me and to
[35:51] DO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL in me, too."
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe you may be thinking in your heart,
[35:56] "Well, I guess that could only happen in
[35:59] the Bible days. I mean, there there can
[36:01] only be one virgin girl, right?
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, but that's where the story gets
[36:07] really good.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; That's where it gets really really good.
[36:11] And actually, that's where it all
[36:13] begins. Jesus grew up and was killed for
[36:16] our sins.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Everyone was sad. Amen. But this was
[36:22] part of God's plan. If Jesus chose to
[36:26] die for our sins and that made a way FOR
[36:30] THE PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS OVER THE
[36:32] TABERNACLE, for the pillar of fire that
[36:35] came down upon Virgin Mary,
[36:39] the same pillar of fire that filled Mo
[36:42] that filled Jesus
[36:43] [applause and cheering]
[36:44] is THE SAME PILLAR OF fire that'll fill
[36:48] you. Hallelujah. It's that same pillar
[36:51] of fire. That's what God's looking for.
[36:54] Amen. Hallelujah. Now, remember this.
[36:57] After the death, burial, and
[37:00] resurrection of Jesus, he told his
[37:02] disciples,
[37:04] he says, "Now listen, there's still some
[37:06] prophecies
[37:07] &gt;&gt; that must be fulfilled,
[37:10] &gt;&gt; and I've chosen you to be the ones
[37:13] &gt;&gt; that he uses."
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, that does my heart so good.
[37:17] Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; It would happen in them.
[37:22] [applause and cheering]
[37:24] And then they began TO HAVE THOSE SAME
[37:27] DESIRES THAT MARY HAD.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Let it be me. Let it be me. They went up
[37:34] into the upper room and they begin to
[37:36] 120 OF THEM GOT TOGETHER and they begin
[37:38] to say, "COULD GOD USE ME? LORD, WILL
[37:41] YOU FILL ME? IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE
[37:44] SOMEBODY, USE ME."
[37:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. As they begin to prepare
[37:49] themselves in prayer, the Bible says
[37:52] that same pillar of fire came down in
[37:55] that upper room and it filled them all
[37:58] with the Holy Ghost.
[38:02] GLORY TO GOD. FILL THEM ALL WITH A
[38:05] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. [applause]
[38:07] AMEN.
[38:09] Then it happened. Amen. God's spirit
[38:12] came down upon them and filled them so
[38:14] full that they would never be the same
[38:16] again. They had something more than Mary
[38:19] had. Now Mary gave birth, Amen, to the
[38:22] body of God. But these men and women,
[38:26] these men and women were born again and
[38:29] they became the body of God. [cheering]
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Did you know that Virgin Mary was up in
[38:38] the upper room with them?
[38:41] Mary Mary gave birth
[38:45] to Jesus.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; But Mary wasn't satisfied.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Mary says, "I want something happening
[38:52] in my soul, too."
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, can't you say amen to that?
[38:58] Amen.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Then that same pillar of fire was now in
[39:02] his church and they had a virgin birth
[39:04] and their souls were born again and
[39:08] their lives would forever more be
[39:10] changed and they spent the rest of their
[39:12] lives doing the works of Jesus.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I want to say here
[39:16] today, the spirit of Jesus that was
[39:20] living in them and quickening their
[39:22] bodies is the same spirit of Jesus
[39:27] &gt;&gt; that'll come down upon every one of you
[39:29] here tonight. [cheering]
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:33] On that day, [applause]
[39:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[39:37] ON THAT DAY, [cheering] THE APOSTLE
[39:39] PETER, AMEN, he stood up
[39:43] and he said, "This is part of the Bible.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; This is the PART THAT JOEL THAT THAT THE
[39:49] PROPHET JOEL PROPHESIED OF."
[39:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. For Joel had prophesied there in
[39:54] Joel 2 and 28. And it shall come to pass
[39:57] afterwards that I will pour out my
[40:00] spirit upon all flesh. And I love this
[40:02] part right here. and your sons [music]
[40:04] and your daughters, the children shall
[40:08] prophesy. Your old men shall dream
[40:10] dreams. And here you go. And the young
[40:13] men shall see visions.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, pastor, we don't we don't
[40:19] see anything like that going on. Is God
[40:21] still doing these things today?"
[40:24] [applause and cheering]
[40:25] &gt;&gt; But I want to say, yes.
[40:28] Yes.
[40:30] God is still doing this today.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; He's still doing it today. There are
[40:36] still mamas and daddies. THERE'S STILL
[40:39] BOYS AND GIRLS
[40:41] &gt;&gt; WHO HAS THAT CRAZY DESIRE.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE GOT THE CRAZY DESIRE SAYING,
[40:47] "JESUS, won't you use me? [applause]
[40:51] JESUS, WON'T YOU FILL ME? JESUS, WON'T
[40:54] YOU DO TO ME what you done to those of
[40:58] the Old Testament?" [applause]
[40:59] Hallelujah.
[41:01] Amen. I say today, Amen. as as as as the
[41:05] Holy Spirit has been here on the earth
[41:08] and as we see this rapturing time of
[41:11] coming. If there's ever been a time,
[41:13] Amen, that God is moving upon children.
[41:16] It's in this hour.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; There's a moving of God upon the young
[41:20] people in this day. We see the moving of
[41:22] God in the youth camps. We see the
[41:24] moving of God in our churches. I say IF
[41:26] THERE'S EVER A TIME, LET'S GIVE
[41:28] EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT TO JESUS.
[41:30] [cheering]
[41:31] LET'S GIVE EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT TO
[41:33] JESUS. HALLELUJAH.
[41:36] Peter continued and he said, [applause]
[41:39] he said, "For this promise is unto you,
[41:43] to your children,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; and to as many as the that are a far
[41:48] off, as many as the Lord our God should
[41:51] call."
[41:52] &gt;&gt; How many wants God to use you today?
[41:54] Hallelujah.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want him to use you today.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; There there is there there is a cry.
[42:01] THERE IS A DESIRE WITHIN us today.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many's
[42:08] going to raise your hand and say, "I
[42:09] want to be that one." Hallelujah. Why
[42:11] don't we sing that song to him here?
[42:13] Amen. There's a there's a new song I'm
[42:15] going to teach y'all and we can we can
[42:17] learn this. Y'all going to have to help
[42:18] me out here. [music] Sister Mary

[56:55] Wasn't that love?
[56:58] Wasn't that love?
[57:03] He knew [singing] pain and loneliness

[57:13] Wasn't [music] that love?
[57:17] Oh, wasn't that love?
[57:20] Oh, how he left his home above to die on

[57:36] There's only one thing left to say.
[57:39] Wasn't that love?
[57:42] Oh, wasn't that love?
[57:47] as he stood in Pilot's hall. He never
[57:51] said a word at all. Wasn't that love?
[57:55] What a love.
[57:57] Oh, wasn't that love?
[58:01] He heard the mother crucified, [music]

[58:55] Wasn't that love? [singing]
[58:59] But he rose up from that grave so that I

[59:56] Every day I'm still amazed. There's only
[1:00:00] one thing [music and singing] left to

[1:14:08] married,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; I know. I probably should have done that
[1:14:12] to be honest. Yeah, but but yes, Rahab
[1:14:16] and Salmon.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:14:20] So,
[1:14:24] okay. Well, but since I didn't make that
[1:14:26] clear at the beginning, uh we're just
[1:14:28] going to give it We're going to give it
[1:14:29] to the girls or
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; to the left. To the left.
[1:14:35] Oh, this is going to get bad. Okay. All
[1:14:37] right.
[1:14:41] Okay. Um
[1:14:45] All right.
[1:14:47] When listening to the message, what
[1:14:50] shadow was Jesus born under?
[1:15:07] Well, y'all y'all better y'all y'all got
[1:15:09] to find your answer on that one.
[1:15:12] [clears throat]
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; What shadow was Jesus born under?
[1:15:30] All right, come up with your answer.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Y'all y'all need y'all need
[1:15:34] each other's help. Go. Y'all y'all help
[1:15:36] each other. It's informal here.
[1:15:39] You're You guys are going to need each
[1:15:41] other's helps on a few of these answers.
[1:15:46] All right.
[1:15:51] Anyone want to steal it? Anyone
[1:15:55] want to steal it
[1:15:57] or not steal it? We don't steal in the
[1:15:58] house of God.
[1:16:01] Okay. All right.
[1:16:04] Um,
[1:16:07] why did the angels Why did the angels
[1:16:11] come to the shepherds?
[1:16:23] the religious leaders wouldn't accept
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; that. That's right. It was God's wisdom
[1:16:31] because the theologians of the day
[1:16:33] wouldn't receive the message.
[1:16:36] The prophet would tell us it might not
[1:16:39] amount The prophet would tell us it
[1:16:42] might not amount to very much, but I
[1:16:45] want to pass my opinion. I believe it's
[1:16:48] because it's the wisdom of God that he
[1:16:51] knew they wouldn't receive the message
[1:16:53] the way it came. It wasn't in the taste,
[1:16:56] their taste of learning. It was
[1:16:58] different. It wasn't what they had been
[1:17:01] trained to believe he would look like,
[1:17:04] he would be like. And I want to say amen
[1:17:06] to that. When the word of the Lord comes
[1:17:09] in this day, God can come in so such a
[1:17:12] precious way in his word being fulfilled
[1:17:15] and the majority of the people will not
[1:17:18] accept it because it it's not according
[1:17:20] to what their church teaches.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. God is just as real today
[1:17:26] as he's always been. And God is
[1:17:29] fulfilling prophecy right now in his
[1:17:32] bride. But people get a rank attitude
[1:17:35] and uh and and God doesn't reveal
[1:17:37] himself to them. All right. So that's
[1:17:40] another point. So that is two zero.
[1:17:44] All right. This this side over here. How
[1:17:47] many years had they been waiting for the
[1:17:50] Messiah?
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; 4,000 years is right.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to say, come on. Got to
[1:18:00] get some finger going on there.
[1:18:01] [applause]
[1:18:06] All right. Over here to the left. What
[1:18:09] did brother Brandham say a common habit
[1:18:12] of the people uh were? What what common
[1:18:15] habit do the people have?
[1:18:29] What habit is common among people today
[1:18:33] or among among people
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; of yeah of of of all days of of all days
[1:18:52] there's a common habit among the
[1:19:08] That is exactly. Did you help come up
[1:19:10] with these with these questions?
[1:19:22] they they they are always praising God
[1:19:26] for what he has done and saying what he
[1:19:30] will do.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; So so they always so that is a correct
[1:19:34] answer. So they they always
[1:19:39] um uh that's the way they do. Now back
[1:19:42] over here to the right. Did everyone see
[1:19:45] the star?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Good question. That's that that is
[1:19:50] correct. The wise men followed them for
[1:19:53] two years or or followed that star for
[1:19:56] two years. And when when the wise men
[1:20:00] got into Jerusalem, which was the most
[1:20:04] holy city among the most holy people,
[1:20:10] God God had used the Jews. God was
[1:20:12] dealing with the Jews. And they asked,
[1:20:15] "Where is he the king of the Jews?" And
[1:20:18] they say, "We don't we don't know
[1:20:20] anything. We don't know anything." So
[1:20:23] they never seen the star. So, it takes a
[1:20:26] a special a special group. And I'm glad
[1:20:29] today that we can see that gr and that's
[1:20:31] the way it is with revelation today set
[1:20:33] in the same church and God will reveal
[1:20:35] himself to one and then and then two
[1:20:38] other people might not ever see it. But
[1:20:39] aren't you glad God reveals to you?
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, uh over here to
[1:20:46] the left, who does God choose to reveal
[1:20:49] himself to?
[1:21:05] I I heard something over here.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What?
[1:21:10] Yeah.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Overall, who who does he
[1:21:22] reveal himself to?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we we'd accept that. The nobodies.
[1:21:31] Brother Brandham would put the nobodies.
[1:21:34] He choose God chooses the nobody. That's
[1:21:37] the reason he chose the shepherds. The
[1:21:40] shepherds was completely at home with
[1:21:42] the God lamb in their midst. His word
[1:21:45] made flesh among them. The proud and the
[1:21:48] wise never received it and passed them
[1:21:51] and passed by them. Isn't that Isn't
[1:21:53] that just incredible? Amen. All right.
[1:21:56] Over here to the to to the right. What
[1:22:00] is always common at the birth of a king?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Singing. Singing is correct.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:22:11] Always.
[1:22:16] All right. To the left. Throughout all
[1:22:20] scripture, redemption has been
[1:22:23] represented through blank and blank.
[1:22:30] This will be interesting.
[1:22:37] Throughout the scripture, redemption has
[1:22:40] been represented through blank and
[1:22:42] blank.
[1:23:00] Mercy and grace.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; That's your final answer.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Told me to say it.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:11] throughout the scripture.
[1:23:14] You guys, y'all have y'all y'all can get
[1:23:16] y'all can get a bonus point here. I
[1:23:18] can't use that word steel.
[1:23:20] Throughout all scripture, redemption has
[1:23:24] been represented through blank and
[1:23:26] blank.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Shepherds and sheep. We were listening
[1:23:51] to the sermon why it had to be
[1:23:53] shepherds.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:23:58] Shepherds and sheep.

[1:25:10] without what following.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; No. What is it?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; We'll accept that. the supernatural.
[1:25:26] [applause and cheering]
[1:25:31] [applause]
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; All right, guys. They're they're they
[1:25:35] they've caught back up over here. All
[1:25:38] right.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; You guys have had all the easy ones.
[1:25:49] What you talking about?
[1:25:51] The prophets
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; were usually what?
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; What? What? What's your What's your
[1:26:10] answer? I I can't.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Seers.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; No, that's not what we're looking for.
[1:26:21] But they gave that one.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Why did the herds
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; uh prophets were usually what? So So did
[1:26:33] we did Did you guys give y'all's answer?
[1:26:34] Did y'all say
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; seers?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; All right. So that's seers, but that's
[1:26:42] not what we're looking for.
[1:26:45] So over here, prophets are usually what?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Shepherds is right. They're usually
[1:26:53] herdsmen. [applause]
[1:26:57] Now, now it is important you you guys
[1:27:00] should all get together and do your
[1:27:02] talking and that way that that way u you
[1:27:04] know y'all's not saying two different
[1:27:06] things. But that's right. All most of
[1:27:10] the prophets of the o testament most all
[1:27:14] of them that you read about were all
[1:27:17] shepherds. They were herdsmen. All
[1:27:19] right? [clears throat] Isn't that what
[1:27:21] crazy? Abraham a shepherd.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Isaac a shepherd.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Jacob a shepherd.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Moses a shepherd. David was a shepherd.
[1:27:30] Most all of these were shepherds. So,
[1:27:32] it's pretty incredible that God comes to
[1:27:35] the shepherds instead of to the
[1:27:37] preachers when he was born. All right.
[1:27:40] [clears throat]
[1:27:41] [snorts]
[1:27:42] All right. So, you guys, that was a
[1:27:43] bonus point for y'all, right? All right.
[1:27:46] So,
[1:27:47] why
[1:27:49] did the herdsman wear sheep skin?
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's y'all sight.
[1:28:13] Is that y'all's answer?
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; All right. So,
[1:28:39] Okay. So, what's what's the answer?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Why did the herdsman wear sheep skin?
[1:29:12] All right, y'all. Y'all's choice.
[1:29:15] Y'all's chance to get a bonus point. Why
[1:29:17] did the herdsman wear sheep skin?
[1:29:22] Is
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; that y'all's answer?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; No, I was telling them what they said.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:29:47] They believed there was coming a perfect
[1:29:50] lamb sacrifice.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; So they there it was symbolic not just
[1:29:58] clothing but it was symbolic. They they
[1:30:02] had the revelation of God even way back
[1:30:05] then. Revelation were in those prophets
[1:30:08] and their clothing was even symbolic of
[1:30:11] what they believed was coming.
[1:30:13] Abel slew a lamb because he had a
[1:30:16] revelation that there was going to be
[1:30:18] the perfect lamb. All right. So,
[1:30:22] all right.
[1:30:25] Um, okay. Back over here to the left or
[1:30:28] yeah, to the left. What did brother
[1:30:30] Brandham liken Moses rod to?
[1:30:34] [snorts]
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; A shepherd's staff is correct. That is
[1:30:42] exactly right.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; That's That's exactly right.
[1:30:49] What uh over here to my right? What does
[1:30:52] the name Bethlehem mean?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; No, it's the house of God's bread.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; You did say that. Oh, okay. All right.
[1:31:10] All right. So, you get that point. All
[1:31:13] right. So, over here to my right, left.
[1:31:17] How old was John the Baptist when he
[1:31:20] went into the wilderness?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Nine.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Nine is correct.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; No clapping.
[1:31:28] [applause]
[1:31:32] Hey, they're catching back up over here,

[1:31:52] thousands of Judah, yet out of thee
[1:31:56] shall he come forth unto me, that is to
[1:31:58] be ruler of Israel, whose going forth
[1:32:00] have been from old, from everlasting."
[1:32:04] No looking at phones.
[1:32:11] Which prophet said that? Yes. That
[1:32:13] that's a that's a scripture. [snorts]
[1:32:22] I'm going to tell you, we had I done a
[1:32:25] youth camp
[1:32:28] and if those guys, you know, they were
[1:32:29] doing a little they were doing little
[1:32:30] skit or little little quizzes between
[1:32:32] the the the the teams, the boys and the
[1:32:35] girls. And then they all voted that they
[1:32:39] would they would do the the the kids
[1:32:42] against the preachers. Oh man, they were
[1:32:46] giving us a run for our money here. All
[1:32:48] of us preachers were lined up and those
[1:32:50] kids, they were pretty smart.
[1:32:54] They were pretty smart.
[1:32:56] All right. What What do we have over
[1:32:58] here? What prophet That's a long That's

[1:33:28] been from old, from everlasting.
[1:33:32] What prophet?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; I figured dad would know this one
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; cuz he quotes it
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; was Micah.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; So Micah is the one who quoted that.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:34:07] Are we back over here to the left?
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Sheep aren't born in a house. This This
[1:34:14] is a quote. Sheep aren't born in a house
[1:34:17] or a pink decorated hospital room.
[1:34:22] They are born in
[1:34:31] Sheep aren't born in a house or a pink

[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; The crow.
[1:42:36] I heard you say it, too.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Are y'all Y'all need to start listening
[1:42:40] to Brother Joe a little bit? A crow can
[1:42:43] set out here and eat on dead horse all
[1:42:47] day and fly out there in the field and
[1:42:50] eat grain with the dove. But a dove
[1:42:53] cannot fly over there and eat on the
[1:42:56] dead horse and then eat grain. It would
[1:42:58] kill him.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; All right, man. Y'all had your chance.
[1:43:06] So, and and that's a good that's a good
[1:43:08] that's a good sign. Okay. When Jes or
[1:43:11] when Moses Moses when Noah
[1:43:14] let out the he let out two birds. He let
[1:43:18] out the crow or he let out the dove and
[1:43:21] and and the and the dove went flying
[1:43:24] around and came back. Now, he he he let
[1:43:27] out the dove twice. Is that correct?
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then he and then he lets out
[1:43:32] the crow and the crow stays out there.
[1:43:37] So, you know, he don't know. They could
[1:43:38] they don't know whether they're still
[1:43:40] And then he got to thinking, what? Wait
[1:43:43] a minute. The dove was going around
[1:43:46] trying to land on a tree. The crow
[1:43:50] the crow stayed out there. He had plenty
[1:43:52] of food to eat.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; So, the crow stayed out there eating on
[1:43:55] all the dead bodies. So he waited a
[1:43:57] little bit longer and then and then Noah
[1:44:00] puts out the dove again and then the
[1:44:02] dove comes back with a little with a
[1:44:04] little tree, a little limb in her beak
[1:44:07] to let her know and let them know that
[1:44:09] that uh uh land is is ready to inhabit.
[1:44:12] Isn't that isn't that something? So So
[1:44:16] that is
[1:44:20] all right.

[1:49:32] Um they they worshiped him. I I don't I
[1:49:36] don't even know if that's if that's even
[1:49:38] if I was asking them if that's
[1:49:39] scriptural that that they kneel. Did
[1:49:41] they kneel? I mean, I I I don't I don't
[1:49:44] know. I I'm okay.
[1:49:53] All right.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; All right. Over here to my
[1:49:58] over here to my right
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; or to the right. All right. True or
[1:50:03] false?
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; True or false? The three wise men were
[1:50:12] present at Jesus birth.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Well, that was a hard one.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; All right
[1:50:21] over over here to the left,
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Christmas wasn't a true or false.
[1:50:28] Christmas wasn't celebrated for over 300
[1:50:31] years after Jesus died.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; True. True.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; That is correct. Christmas was not
[1:50:39] celebrated
[1:50:40] um until December 25th 3000 336 AD.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; So the very first Christmas, the very
[1:50:51] first worshiping of of celebrating of
[1:50:54] his birth was 336
[1:50:58] years after Jesus was born.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; 11 years
[1:51:04] Yes, that's that's exactly right.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, but that but that just goes
[1:51:10] to show the dogma, you know, the dogma's
[1:51:12] just starting every year. They just add
[1:51:13] on and and add on and add on and and
[1:51:17] that's the reason why if you get away
[1:51:18] from the word in one point and and
[1:51:21] listen and I and and and you say, "Well,
[1:51:25] are you are you for Christmas or against
[1:51:26] Christmas?"
[1:51:30] There's nothing scriptural about
[1:51:31] Christmas
[1:51:32] about about celebrating his birth at
[1:51:35] all. They didn't do it. And they didn't
[1:51:36] do it in the f the apostles didn't do
[1:51:38] it. The disciples didn't do it. Uh they
[1:51:40] went for 300 years. Hey, we hadn't even
[1:51:42] been a country for 300 years. Okay? The
[1:51:44] USA hadn't even been a country for 300
[1:51:47] years yet. And so, but it was it was
[1:51:50] these guys trying to add dogma to the
[1:51:52] church and then they started adding this
[1:51:53] and that and the other. And that's the
[1:51:55] reason why I don't want to be an old
[1:51:56] Scrooge. Uh well, that's part of
[1:51:59] Christmas, too. I don't want to be I
[1:52:02] don't want to be,
[1:52:05] you know, a bad a bad guy. It it's just
[1:52:09] the stuff that we put in our kids and
[1:52:12] and and and their minds is
[1:52:15] it's it's it's
[1:52:17] pagan. It's not right. It's not real.
[1:52:22] You have a quote. Go and read it.
[1:52:29] The cruelty of sin. And it says, "And
[1:52:32] every man and woman that goes to
[1:52:33] church." Today, I was thinking of the
[1:52:34] cathe the cathedrals ringing out, the
[1:52:36] bells tolling and so forth like that.
[1:52:39] People going to church, making ready and
[1:52:41] women buying their Easter hats and so
[1:52:44] forth. And what what does it come to? My
[1:52:47] how I can't understand where a rabbit
[1:52:49] has anything to do with the
[1:52:50] resurrection. See, no sir. How a
[1:52:53] Christmas tree has anything to do with
[1:52:55] the birth of Christ. It's pagan,
[1:52:57] friends. You've got off the path
[1:52:59] somewhere. That's right. And he says,
[1:53:02] uh, but now a real born again man or
[1:53:04] woman re realizes because there's life
[1:53:07] within you tells you that that's wrong.
[1:53:09] Isn't that right? So, that's a good
[1:53:11] quote. Amen. So, so we're thankful for
[1:53:14] the spirit of the Lord that that gives
[1:53:16] us these these things in our in our in
[1:53:19] our lives. Amen. All right. So, here
[1:53:21] here where we at. How many how many more
[1:53:23] questions have I just done? Okay. All
[1:53:25] right. So, we I I'm we've only got two
[1:53:28] two questions that I've done since we
[1:53:29] started the 10. So, we got to hurry this
[1:53:31] through.
[1:53:35] Okay. Yeah. All right. Which one's next?
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:53:42] What lineage did the three wise men come
[1:53:45] from?
[1:53:57] What lineages?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, we're on this side.
[1:54:33] You you'd be getting you
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; the answer to

[1:54:56] the the the lineages and there's and
[1:54:58] there's there's there's three there
[1:55:01] there's going to be three answers.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I I should have brought

[1:55:24] That's it.
[1:55:26] [applause]
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; That's That's it. That That was a tough
[1:55:34] one, too.
[1:55:38] Hi.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Over here to my or to to to your left to
[1:55:51] your to your left.
[1:55:55] Um, okay. What was the name of Jesus
[1:55:59] early or earthly grandfather?
[1:56:38] moderator
[1:56:40] talking.
[1:56:42] We'll give him our answer.
[1:56:53] All right. So, who what what was Jesus
[1:56:56] earthly grandfather's?
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; All right, y'all have y'all's answer.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Jacob.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Jacob is correct.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; I didn't think that was correct. I was
[1:57:18] asking Kobe. I don't know. But he just
[1:57:21] came and showed me in the scripture in
[1:57:22] the lineages. So, Jacob was his
[1:57:25] grandfather.
[1:57:26] All right.
[1:57:29] Okay. Um,
[1:57:33] let's see. The uh uh o over here.
[1:57:38] Y'all keep track of my of my How many is
[1:57:41] that? Is that four? Is that four
[1:57:42] questions?
[1:57:45] All right. Over here to this side. Did
[1:57:48] the star lead the wise men straight to
[1:57:50] Jesus?
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Noah is correct.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; They Noah is correct.
[1:58:00] Led him to the general vicinity. They
[1:58:03] went to they went to Jerusalem asking
[1:58:06] around. The star had disappeared. They
[1:58:09] they were asking they were all saying we
[1:58:11] don't know what's going on. And then
[1:58:13] they went back the wise men started
[1:58:16] looking through the scrolls and they
[1:58:19] found that in Daniel it says that uh or
[1:58:22] in in in the uh prophecies that that
[1:58:25] Jesus would be born in Bethlehem. So
[1:58:28] when they left Jerusalem then the star
[1:58:32] appeared to them again and led them to
[1:58:35] Bethlehem or or to where the child was
[1:58:37] at. And so, uh, that was that was
[1:58:40] incredible, wasn't it?
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; And so, um,
[1:58:45] uh, it says the star led them to there
[1:58:47] in Matthew 2, uh, the star first led
[1:58:51] them to King Herod, and after they saw
[1:58:53] the star again leading them to Jesus.
[1:58:55] Um, but they were two two separate
[1:58:58] sightings. All right. Um let let's see
[1:59:03] over here to the left. How deep was the
[1:59:06] snow
[1:59:08] uh when Jesus was born?
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; There was no snow. Why wasn't there
[1:59:17] snow?
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not born in December. Jesus
[1:59:22] was born in the spring. Why? Jesus was a
[1:59:26] lamb. That's right. He was God's lamb.
[1:59:29] Born in a barn. Born in a stable. All
[1:59:32] right.
[1:59:38] [laughter]
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; All right. If you all think that they've
[1:59:44] done their job, let's come over here and
[1:59:45] ask you all, what song did the angel
[1:59:48] sing when they appeared to the
[1:59:50] shepherds?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; That is right. That is right.
[2:00:20] [applause]
[2:00:23] And if we want to get down to the
[2:00:24] nitty-gritty, they didn't sing.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; They proclaimed.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; They were wrong.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; So I guess that was the first rap song
[2:00:32] ever.
[2:00:33] [laughter]
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:38] Because actually Luke says that the
[2:00:40] heavenly host said, so there was a whole
[2:00:43] group of angels. So it doesn't
[2:00:45] necessarily say that they sang. It's
[2:00:47] just it's just common knowledge or it's
[2:00:49] it's it's just tradition and and and the
[2:00:52] prophet went along with that. So,
[2:00:56] [clears throat]
[2:00:56] um let's see here. Okay, so that's six.
[2:01:00] Is that right? Six. So, we have four
[2:01:02] more to go. All right, let's count down
[2:01:03] as we go. Um man, I'm I'm trying. Um
[2:01:09] All right. who said,"Lord, now let us
[2:01:12] thy your servant depart in peace
[2:01:15] according to thy word, for my eyes have
[2:01:18] seen your salvation."
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Simeon is correct.
[2:01:28] [applause]
[2:01:31] All right. What is the name of the city
[2:01:34] of David, also uh known as in the Bible?
[2:01:44] Don't forget their point.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to have 13.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; You lost. [laughter]
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Hey, don't be watching the scoreboard.
[2:02:19] Yeah, that'll be
[2:02:22] that' be that'd be a cute one.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Okay, have y'all answered?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Bethlehem is correct. Two more to go.
[2:02:31] Two more to go. [applause]
[2:02:38] Okay.
[2:02:40] So, what are the names brother Brandham
[2:02:42] gave the three wise men? This is in
[2:02:45] everlasting life and how to receive it.
[2:02:51] [laughter]
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; You have to think deep and wild.
[2:03:21] Get all three, right?

[2:03:58] going to do?

[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Is that what you want to go with?
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; You know, it's not exactly right. I
[2:04:27] don't know if any of it's right. Let's
[2:04:28] try over here. What do y'all have on
[2:04:30] this side?
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So,
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; yeah. All right. But but but they
[2:04:52] already gave their answer for both
[2:04:53] sides, so we're not giving either of

[2:05:36] illustration you know Jim George and

[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; How many can give brother Merl a big
[2:33:49] hand clap? [applause]
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; All right
[2:34:02] then.
[2:34:04] [snorts]
[2:34:18] The first story
[2:34:20] I was going to take a year off from my
[2:34:23] uh my acting uh but uh but by popular
[2:34:28] demand I was asked to do uh
[2:34:33] the man and his birds and the birds.
[2:34:35] again. So, uh, just kind of scoot back a
[2:34:38] little bit. Just just give me this.
[2:34:40] Okay. You're in you're in this. So,
[2:34:42] yeah.
[2:34:44] So, just scoot back a little bit. Just
[2:34:46] And then on the when I when I read after
[2:34:49] this story, then I'll have y'all come up
[2:34:50] real close. Okay. So, I don't want to uh
[2:34:58] get up there.
[2:35:01] I don't really need this right now on
[2:35:03] this story.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; The man to whom I'm going to introduce
[2:35:37] to you was not a Scrooge. He was a kind,
[2:35:41] decent, mostly good man,
[2:35:44] generous to his family, upright in all
[2:35:47] his dealings with other men. But he just
[2:35:51] didn't believe all that incarnation
[2:35:53] stuff which the churches proclaim at
[2:35:56] Christmas time.
[2:35:58] It just didn't make any sense. And he
[2:36:00] was too honest to pretend otherwise.
[2:36:03] He just couldn't swallow the Jesus story
[2:36:06] about God coming to earth as a man.
[2:36:10] I'm truly sorry to distress you, he told
[2:36:13] his wife. But I'm not going with you to
[2:36:16] church this Christmas Eve.
[2:36:19] He said he'd feel like a hypocrite,
[2:36:22] that he'd much rather just stay at home,
[2:36:26] but that he would wait for them.
[2:36:29] And so he stayed and they went to the
[2:36:31] midnight service.
[2:36:41] Shortly after the family drove away in
[2:36:43] the car, snow be to fall.
[2:36:47] He went to the window to watch the
[2:36:50] flurries getting heavier and heavier.
[2:36:55] And then he went back to his fire side
[2:36:58] chair and begin to read a book.
[2:37:12] Minutes later, he was startled by a
[2:37:16] thuting sound. Then another, and then
[2:37:19] another, sort of a thump or a thud.
[2:37:23] At first, he thought someone must be
[2:37:25] throwing snowballs against his living
[2:37:28] room window.
[2:37:30] But when he went to the front door to
[2:37:32] investigate,
[2:37:34] he found a flock of birds huddled
[2:37:36] miserably in the snow.
[2:37:39] They've been caught in the storm and in
[2:37:41] a desperate search for shelter had tried
[2:37:44] to fly through his large landscape
[2:37:46] window. Well, he couldn't let these poor
[2:37:49] creatures lie there and freeze.
[2:37:52] So, he remembered the barn where his
[2:37:54] children stabled their pony
[2:37:57] that would provide a warm shelter if he
[2:38:00] could only direct the birds to it.
[2:38:14] and pause.
[2:38:21] So quickly he put on a coat and boots.
[2:38:41] 30 minutes later.
[2:38:43] [laughter]
[2:38:49] So quickly he put on a coat and boots,
[2:38:52] trampled through the deepening snow to
[2:38:54] the barn.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; He opened the doors wide and turned on a
[2:39:00] light,
[2:39:06] but the birds did not come in. Well, he
[2:39:11] figured food would entice them, so he
[2:39:13] hurried back to the house.
[2:39:16] Oh, sorry, Russian there.
[2:39:22] Eddie fetched some breadcrumbs
[2:39:27] and began sprinkling them on the snow,
[2:39:33] making a trail to the yellow litted
[2:39:37] wideopen doorway of the stable.
[2:39:46] But to his dismay, the birds ignored the
[2:39:49] breadcrumbs
[2:39:51] and continued to flap around helplessly
[2:39:54] in the snow. Well,
[2:39:56] he tried to catch them.
[2:40:02] He even tried shoeing them into the barn
[2:40:06] by walking around waving his arms.
[2:40:12] Instead, they scattered in every
[2:40:14] direction except into the warm
[2:40:18] litted barn.
[2:40:21] And then he realized that they were
[2:40:23] afraid of him.
[2:40:26] To them, he reasoned, "I'm a stranger
[2:40:30] and a terrifying creature.
[2:40:32] If only I could think of a way
[2:40:36] to let them know that they can trust me,
[2:40:40] that I'm not trying to hurt them, but to
[2:40:42] help them. But how?
[2:40:45] Because every move he made tended to
[2:40:47] frighten them and confuse them. They
[2:40:50] just would not follow.
[2:40:53] They would not be led or shued because
[2:40:55] they feared him.
[2:40:57] If only I could be a bird, he thought to
[2:40:59] himself,
[2:41:01] and meagle with them and speak their
[2:41:03] language,
[2:41:05] then I could tell them not to be afraid.
[2:41:08] Then I could show them the way to the
[2:41:11] safe,
[2:41:12] warm barn.
[2:41:14] But I would have to be one of them so
[2:41:17] they could see and hear and understand.
[2:41:21] At that very moment, the church bells
[2:41:23] begin to ring. The sound reached his
[2:41:26] ears above the sounds of the wind.
[2:41:29] And he stood there listening to the
[2:41:31] bells. Oh, come all ye faithful.
[2:41:35] Listening to the bells, pearling the
[2:41:38] glad tidings of Christmas.
[2:41:41] Oh, he sank to his knees in the snow.
[2:41:45] Oh Lord, now I understand why you came
[2:41:47] in flesh and blood. So we could hear you
[2:41:51] and see you and touch you. So we can
[2:41:54] understand and believe why you were born
[2:41:56] to live and die and [snorts] rise from
[2:41:59] the dead, ascend, then return as the
[2:42:03] Holy Spirit to live in us and with us.
[2:42:07] When his family returned,
[2:42:13] he excitedly shared his experience that
[2:42:17] he just had.
[2:42:20] The next day they had the best Christmas
[2:42:24] ever
[2:42:27] and seen.
[2:42:31] [applause]
[2:43:01] Too close.
[2:43:33] testing testing. Thank you, brother
[2:43:36] Caleb.
[2:43:39] So, did you kids understand that story
[2:43:41] about the man and the birds?
[2:43:47] Who understood that story about the man
[2:43:49] and the birds?
[2:43:51] But that man couldn't become a bird.
[2:43:57] But God is so great.
[2:44:01] He He could become a human.
[2:44:04] Isn't that wonderful?
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; This is a story.
[2:44:23] I've got one fairly short story and then
[2:44:27] a longer story.
[2:44:32] Excuse me.
[2:44:34] My wife's trying to help me uh learn how
[2:44:38] to uh use uh electronic devices. Brother
[2:44:42] Wendell,
[2:44:48] I sure appreciate y'all coming up here
[2:44:50] and this is a really privilege to uh to
[2:44:54] read stories to you every year. I don't
[2:44:56] remember what year did we start, Brother
[2:44:58] Wendell?
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; 15 years.
[2:45:03] I know it was before Adam, so I don't
[2:45:06] know how many years, but uh I hope you
[2:45:08] all enjoy these stories. And uh
[2:45:14] this is a story
[2:45:17] of the shepherds.
[2:45:20] The hundreds of sheep were quiet now,
[2:45:24] except for an occasional
[2:45:29] night had fallen. The stars are sharp in
[2:45:33] the nippy sky, and the shepherds
[2:45:34] relaxing on a steep hillside
[2:45:37] above Bethlehem,
[2:45:39] watching over their flocks.
[2:45:43] The men talked quietly among themselves,
[2:45:45] their voices low, somewhat soothing to
[2:45:48] the animals. Old Delias, he had spent
[2:45:50] his lifetime
[2:45:53] on these sheep fields.
[2:45:55] Then there was Judah bin Ozri just 20
[2:45:58] years old and he was angry. His uncle
[2:46:03] had been imprisoned by Roman occupation
[2:46:05] troops for some minor offense. And when
[2:46:08] he could, Judah plotted secretly with a
[2:46:10] unit of zealot guerillas.
[2:46:13] David, Israel's greatest king, had been
[2:46:16] a shepherd on Bethlehem's heels a
[2:46:19] thousand years before.
[2:46:22] As a teenager, David had defeated the
[2:46:24] giant Goliath and thrown off the yoke of
[2:46:29] the Philistine tyranny.
[2:46:32] Judah bin Ozre vowed he would do the
[2:46:35] same.
[2:46:37] If only a leader, a deliverer would come
[2:46:42] and
[2:46:45] and drive the cursed Romans from their
[2:46:49] land.
[2:46:51] The lambs will all die before long, he
[2:46:54] muttered.
[2:46:56] Only the mama sheep will survive.
[2:47:02] Said Elias, the old man. His hearing had
[2:47:05] faded over the years.
[2:47:08] Judah spoke a little louder. The youth's
[2:47:11] will be sheared next summer and bear
[2:47:12] more bear more lambs. But these little
[2:47:16] lambs themselves, what asked Elias? The
[2:47:21] lambs said Judah, won't live beyond
[2:47:24] Passover in in the Jerusalem temple.
[2:47:26] They'll be sacrificed.
[2:47:29] Ah, Passover in the temple,
[2:47:32] said Elias. On the holy day, they'll s
[2:47:35] sacrifice a lamb for each family.
[2:47:40] Jerusalem and its temple were just six
[2:47:42] miles north of Bethlehem. and supplying
[2:47:46] lambs for the Passover sacrifice was
[2:47:49] these shepherds livelihood.
[2:47:52] Passover, reflected the old man. I wish
[2:47:56] I could have seen the first Passover.
[2:48:01] You'd have said you're not you weren't
[2:48:03] around then.
[2:48:07] [laughter]
[2:48:08] Not quite, young shepherd boy.
[2:48:14] Elias would rather talk than listen
[2:48:17] since it was hard for him to hear
[2:48:20] to catch the words when others spoke.
[2:48:23] Moses was our deliverer
[2:48:26] on that first Passover night when God's
[2:48:29] judgment fell upon all of Egypt.
[2:48:34] As he spoke, his listeners could picture
[2:48:37] the destroying angel that had passed
[2:48:39] through Egypt. The Egyptian firstborn
[2:48:43] were killed, said Elias. But each
[2:48:46] Israelite slave family who had
[2:48:49] sacrificed a precious lamb and put its
[2:48:51] blood across the top and on both sides
[2:48:55] of their doorways. Their sins were
[2:48:58] atoned for. The lamb's life given for
[2:49:02] theirs.
[2:49:04] And God's terrible judgment passed over
[2:49:08] them.
[2:49:10] The use will live on, repeated Judah,
[2:49:13] but the lambs will be sacrificed.
[2:49:17] I don't think I'd like to be a lamb, the
[2:49:20] youngest shepherd said sadly.
[2:49:24] The shepherds now fell silent, tugged
[2:49:26] their heavy cloaks about them to shelter
[2:49:28] them from the whistling wind. Their eyes
[2:49:30] were accustomed to the blackness, and
[2:49:32] every mo every few moments they would
[2:49:33] look up up to the scan the hills for
[2:49:36] wolves or thieves.
[2:49:38] They weren't about to lose sheep by
[2:49:40] being careless.
[2:49:43] All of a sudden, their hillside was
[2:49:44] flooded by the light of a thousand
[2:49:47] lamps,
[2:49:48] blinding them with it with its intensity
[2:49:51] when they could finally see a man
[2:49:52] shining of peril stood before them. "Do
[2:49:55] not be afraid," he declared in the
[2:49:58] ringing voice of a herald. I bring you
[2:50:02] good tidings of great joy that will be
[2:50:04] for all people. Today in the town of
[2:50:07] David, a deliverer has been born to you.
[2:50:10] He is the Lord's Messiah. The Messiah,
[2:50:14] the deliverer, breathe Judah bend Azri.
[2:50:17] He has come at last to set our people
[2:50:21] free.
[2:50:24] They could scarcely comprehend. Good
[2:50:27] news, great joy in the town of David.
[2:50:30] The son of David is born this night, the
[2:50:33] Lord's Messiah, the shining man glowing
[2:50:35] with the very shikina glory of God and
[2:50:37] declared it. It must be so. The angel
[2:50:41] continued, "This will be a sign to you.
[2:50:44] You will find a baby wrapped in
[2:50:47] swaddling clothes and lying in a
[2:50:49] manger."
[2:50:51] What a strange sight. But there was no
[2:50:54] time to think.
[2:50:56] Now the shining angel drew himself to
[2:50:58] full height. As he opened out his arms,
[2:51:01] the radiance and glory upon him began to
[2:51:03] spread until it covered rank after rank
[2:51:05] of other angels. The heavenly host, the
[2:51:08] army of God himself, more and more
[2:51:10] company after company began to fill the
[2:51:13] sky. And they began to chant to shout in
[2:51:17] unison, "Glory to God in the highest."
[2:51:21] The sound bounced off the hills and
[2:51:24] echoed from the valleys like the rumble
[2:51:26] of thunder, like the great of a roar of
[2:51:29] a great waterfall. The shout of triumph,
[2:51:33] the shout of worship, the shout of
[2:51:35] honor, the shout of glorious praise.
[2:51:37] Glory to God in the highest, they
[2:51:40] shouted together with one enormous
[2:51:42] voice.
[2:51:44] Glory to God in the highest, they
[2:51:46] chanted, the overwhelming resonance
[2:51:48] blotting out everything else. and giving
[2:51:51] the shepherds just utter joy.
[2:51:55] The host of God overcome with awe at the
[2:51:57] archangel's words now shouted again.
[2:52:01] Glory to God in the highest and on earth
[2:52:03] shalom, peace, goodwill toward men.
[2:52:07] Again and again the waves of praise
[2:52:09] rolled over the hillsides until finally
[2:52:11] the voices began to fade. And only in
[2:52:14] the distance could the shepherd still
[2:52:16] hear the shouts that finally diminished
[2:52:19] into silence.
[2:52:22] The bright light too was fading like the
[2:52:24] final streaks of sunlight dipping below
[2:52:26] the horizon, painting the clouds red and
[2:52:29] pink.
[2:52:31] Old Elias was first to speak. Praise the
[2:52:35] Lord, dear friends. We have witnessed
[2:52:37] what the prophets only dreamed of.
[2:52:40] Angels breathe the youngest. The host of
[2:52:44] God's army, said Judah. Something
[2:52:48] greater still, Elias said, the chance to
[2:52:51] see the Lord's Messiah with our own
[2:52:53] eyes. You heard the angel. He's here in
[2:52:58] Bethlehem, and we must find him. The
[2:53:02] angel told us how. A baby wrapped in
[2:53:05] swaddling bands of a newborn lying in a
[2:53:08] manger. A manger.
[2:53:10] Well, you could find dozens of cattle
[2:53:12] troughs if you searched all the outlying
[2:53:14] farms. But a manger with a newborn baby
[2:53:18] laying in it,
[2:53:20] that was the that would was the sign. In
[2:53:24] Bethlehem itself, Elias could think of
[2:53:26] just one. Inside a dugout at the very
[2:53:29] edge of town where travelers animals
[2:53:31] were quartered, the old man careened
[2:53:33] down the hillside at a pace that left
[2:53:35] the younger shepherds breathless. He was
[2:53:38] ahead of them now, almost running to the
[2:53:41] cave behind the inn. When they finally
[2:53:44] caught up, the old man was standing at
[2:53:46] the doorway to the cave. Dear, tears
[2:53:49] running down his cheeks.
[2:53:52] The son of David, he was saying, the
[2:53:54] Lord's Messiah, the deliverer has come.
[2:53:58] The shepherds moved inside and knelt at
[2:54:01] the manger, peering at the sleeping baby
[2:54:04] boy, all tightly wrapped in swaddling
[2:54:06] bands. The youngest explained to the
[2:54:09] mother, and angel told us. And then
[2:54:15] thousands, maybe millions of angels
[2:54:18] filled the sky, lit it up with God's
[2:54:20] light, shouting, "Glory to God." and we
[2:54:23] we joined them until we we were horse
[2:54:26] until they were all gone.
[2:54:29] Then Elias addressed her, "Young woman,
[2:54:33] mother of this blessed child, you are
[2:54:36] one of the favored ones of whom the Lord
[2:54:38] spoke of the the angel spoke upon whose
[2:54:42] God whom God's glory and grace is
[2:54:44] resting tonight."
[2:54:47] You could see her lips form the words
[2:54:51] Yes, I know. Yes, I know. But no voice
[2:54:55] came.
[2:54:57] The old shepherd went on, "The angel
[2:55:00] told us that your child is God's
[2:55:02] promised Messiah, our deliverer."
[2:55:06] Then the old man was silent. He just
[2:55:08] knelt there for a few more moments.
[2:55:11] Finally, he rose, took the mother's
[2:55:13] hand, pressed it with his own. "God has
[2:55:16] entrusted you to raise his own son, my
[2:55:19] dear. Our prayers are with you. He
[2:55:23] motioned his friends towards the door
[2:55:25] and they got up, leaving the cave in its
[2:55:27] manger and its Christ child. Nor were
[2:55:30] the angels silent about what they had
[2:55:32] seen. They spread the good news far and
[2:55:36] wide. Then they went back to their
[2:55:38] flocks and carefully tended lambs that
[2:55:41] were destined for sacrifice on Passover.
[2:55:45] And though they could not know or
[2:55:47] understand it, the baby deliverer in a
[2:55:50] manger
[2:55:52] would not challenge the Roman
[2:55:55] oppressors,
[2:55:56] but instead deliver us from sin and
[2:56:00] death that oppress us all.
[2:56:04] For these simple shepherds had seen
[2:56:08] God's lamb born to be a pac a Passover
[2:56:13] sacrifice
[2:56:15] for the sins of the whole world. Glory
[2:56:19] to God in the highest and on earth
[2:56:22] peace. Shalom for us all.
[2:56:27] &gt;&gt; The end.
[2:56:29] How'd you like that one? [applause]
[2:56:35] Can I Can I read one more to you?
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:56:40] Glad you teenage boys are joining us.
[2:56:44] Austin and Dylan used to be right there.
[2:56:46] Where they at? They gone. They're right
[2:56:49] there. Oh, they backslid on us, Brother
[2:56:52] Wendell.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, I've done this one
[2:57:00] before. I didn't do it last year, but
[2:57:03] I'm going to uh so y'all probably do not
[2:57:06] remember this. Okay,
[2:57:09] this is called Christmas at widow
[2:57:12] Jensen's and a a widow is somebody who
[2:57:16] has lost their their husband. Okay,
[2:57:20] it was Christmas Eve 1942.
[2:57:28] Brother Torrance was just a little bitty
[2:57:30] toddler. He's not with us tonight, is
[2:57:32] he?
[2:57:35] He was like two years old.
[2:57:40] Well, this is a story of a of a of a boy
[2:57:43] who was 15 years old.
[2:57:46] I was 15 years old and feeling like the
[2:57:49] world had caved in on me because they
[2:57:51] there just wasn't enough money to buy me
[2:57:54] that rifle that I wanted for Christmas.
[2:57:59] Who who who's gotten a rifle for
[2:58:01] Christmas?
[2:58:09] He did we did the chores early that
[2:58:11] night for some reason. I just figured
[2:58:14] daddy wanted a little extra time so we
[2:58:18] he could read the Bible.
[2:58:20] After supper, I took
[2:58:23] was over. I took my boots off and
[2:58:25] stretched out in front of the fireplace
[2:58:28] and way waited for daddy to get down
[2:58:30] that old Bible.
[2:58:33] I was still feeling sorry for myself.
[2:58:35] And to be honest, I wasn't much in a
[2:58:36] mood to read scriptures. But daddy
[2:58:39] didn't get the Bible. Instead, he
[2:58:41] bumbled bundled up and he went outside.
[2:58:45] I couldn't figure it out because we had
[2:58:47] already done all the chores. I didn't
[2:58:50] worry about it long though as I was so
[2:58:53] busy wallowing in my self-pity
[2:58:56] about not getting a rifle for Christmas.
[2:59:00] Soon he came back in and it was it was a
[2:59:03] cold, clear night and there was even ice
[2:59:06] in his beard.
[2:59:08] Come on, Matt.
[2:59:11] Bundle up good. It's cold out tonight.
[2:59:16] I was really upset then. Not only wasn't
[2:59:20] I not getting a rifle for Christmas, now
[2:59:22] he was dragging me out into this cold.
[2:59:25] And for no earthly reason that I could
[2:59:27] see, we'd already done all the chores
[2:59:30] and couldn't think of anything else that
[2:59:31] needed doing, especially not on a cold
[2:59:33] night like this. But I knew he was not
[2:59:37] very patient at one dragging his feet
[2:59:39] when he told him to do something. So I
[2:59:42] got up and put my boots
[2:59:46] back on and got my coat. Mama gave me a
[2:59:49] funny smile as she opened the door to
[2:59:52] leave the house. Something was up, but I
[2:59:56] didn't know what.
[2:59:59] Outside, I became even more dismayed.
[3:00:03] There in front of the house was the
[3:00:04] horses already hitched to the big sled.
[3:00:08] Whatever it was we were going to do
[3:00:10] wasn't going to be a short quick little
[3:00:13] job. I could tell I could tell.
[3:00:18] We never hitched up this sled unless we
[3:00:21] were going to haul a big load. Daddy was
[3:00:24] already up on the seat. The rain's in
[3:00:26] his hand. I reluctantly climbed up
[3:00:29] beside him. The cold was already biting
[3:00:32] at me. I wasn't happy when I was on the
[3:00:36] sled. Daddy pulled the pulled it around
[3:00:38] the house and stopped in front of the
[3:00:40] woodshed.
[3:00:42] He got off and I followed. I think we'll
[3:00:46] put on the high board, son.
[3:00:48] Help. Help me. High sideboards. It was
[3:00:52] it was going to be a bigger job than I
[3:00:54] wanted to do uh with just the low
[3:00:57] sideboards on, but whatever it was we
[3:00:59] were going to do would be a lot bigger
[3:01:02] with the high sideboards on. Then daddy
[3:01:05] went into the woodshed, came out with a
[3:01:07] arm load of wood, the wood I'd spent all
[3:01:10] summer hauling down from the mountain
[3:01:13] and all fall sawing into blocks and
[3:01:16] splitting.
[3:01:17] What is he What was he doing? Finally, I
[3:01:20] said something. I asked, "What? What are
[3:01:23] what are you doing?"
[3:01:28] He said, "You've been by Widow Jensen's
[3:01:31] lately?"
[3:01:34] Well, I knew Mrs. Jensen lived about two
[3:01:38] miles down the road. Her husband had
[3:01:41] died a year or so before.
[3:01:44] Left her there with three children. The
[3:01:46] oldest was only eight. Sure, I'd been by
[3:01:50] their house, but so what? Yeah, I said,
[3:01:54] "Uh, why?"
[3:01:56] I rolled by their house today, Matt.
[3:02:00] Little Jakey was out digging around in
[3:02:02] the wood pile, just trying to find a few
[3:02:05] chips that were left.
[3:02:07] They're out of wood, Matt.
[3:02:13] That's all that he said. And he turned
[3:02:15] and went back into the woodshed for
[3:02:17] another arm load. I followed him. We
[3:02:20] loaded the sled so high that I began to
[3:02:22] wonder if the horses would be able to
[3:02:24] pull it.
[3:02:26] Finally, he called a halt to our
[3:02:28] loading. Then he went to the smokehouse
[3:02:31] and he took down a big ham and a side of
[3:02:33] bacon. He handed them to me and told me
[3:02:35] to put them in the sled and wait. When
[3:02:38] he returned, he he was carrying a sack,
[3:02:40] a flower over his right shoulder and a
[3:02:43] smaller sack of something in his left
[3:02:46] hand. What's in the little sack? I
[3:02:49] asked.
[3:02:51] Shoes, Matt. They're out of shoes.
[3:02:56] Little Jakey had just little gny sacks
[3:02:58] wrapped around his feet when he was out
[3:03:00] in the wood pile this morning. I got the
[3:03:04] children a little candy, too. It just
[3:03:07] wouldn't be Christmas without a little
[3:03:09] candy.
[3:03:11] We rode the two miles to Mrs. Jensen's
[3:03:14] pretty much in silence. I tried to think
[3:03:17] through what daddy was doing. We didn't
[3:03:20] have much by worldly standards. Of
[3:03:23] course, we did have a big wood pile,
[3:03:26] though most of what was left now was
[3:03:29] still in form of logs that I would have
[3:03:31] to saw and split before we could even
[3:03:34] use it.
[3:03:36] We alo also had some meat and flour and
[3:03:38] we we could spare that. But I knew that
[3:03:41] we didn't have any money. So why was he
[3:03:44] buying them shoes and candy?
[3:03:47] Really? Why was he doing any of this at
[3:03:50] all? Miss Jensen had closer neighbors
[3:03:52] than us. It shouldn't have been our
[3:03:56] concern.
[3:03:58] We came in from the blind side of the
[3:04:02] Jensen house where we wouldn't be
[3:04:04] noticed and unloaded the wood as quietly
[3:04:07] as possible. And then we took the meat
[3:04:10] and the flower and the shoes to the
[3:04:12] door. We knocked.
[3:04:16] The door opened crack and a timid voice
[3:04:19] said, "Who is it?"
[3:04:22] Lucas Miles ma'am and my son Matt. Could
[3:04:27] we come in for a bit?
[3:04:30] Mrs. Jensen opened the door and let us
[3:04:32] in. She had a blanket wrapped around her
[3:04:36] shoulders. The children were wrapped in
[3:04:38] another blanket and were sitting in
[3:04:39] front of the fireplace uh by a very
[3:04:43] small fire that hardly gave off any heat
[3:04:46] at all. Mrs. Jensen fumbled with a match
[3:04:50] and finally lit a lamp.
[3:04:54] We brought you a few things, ma'am,"
[3:04:56] Daddy said, and set down the sack of
[3:04:59] flour.
[3:05:00] I put the meat on the table. Then he
[3:05:02] handed her the sack that had the shoes
[3:05:04] in it. She opened it, took the shoes
[3:05:08] out, one pair at a time. There was a
[3:05:11] pair for her and one for each of her
[3:05:14] children. Sturdy shoes. I thought the
[3:05:17] best shoes that I'd ever seen. I knew
[3:05:21] they would last.
[3:05:23] I watched her care carefully. She bit
[3:05:26] her lower lip to keep it from trembling
[3:05:28] and then tears filled her eyes and
[3:05:31] started running down her cheeks.
[3:05:34] She looked up at my daddy like she
[3:05:36] wanted to say something, but it just
[3:05:38] wouldn't come out.
[3:05:41] We brought you a load of wood, too,
[3:05:43] ma'am.
[3:05:45] And turned to me and said, "Matt, go
[3:05:47] bring in enough to last a while. Let's
[3:05:49] get that fire up to size and heat this
[3:05:52] place up.
[3:05:54] I wasn't the same person when I went
[3:05:56] back out to bring in the wood. I had a
[3:05:59] big lump in my throat. As much as I had
[3:06:02] to admit it, there were tears in my
[3:06:05] eyes, too.
[3:06:07] In my mind, I kept seeing those three
[3:06:09] little kids huddled around the fireplace
[3:06:12] and their mother standing there, tears
[3:06:14] running down her cheeks with so much
[3:06:16] gratitude at a heart. She couldn't say a
[3:06:19] word.
[3:06:22] My heart swelled within me and in a joy
[3:06:24] I'd never known before filled my soul.
[3:06:27] I'd given at Christmas many times
[3:06:29] before, but never when it made so much
[3:06:31] difference. I could see where we were
[3:06:34] literally saving the lives [snorts] of
[3:06:37] this this family.
[3:06:39] I soon had the fire blazing and
[3:06:41] everyone's spirit soared. The kids
[3:06:43] started giggling when Daddy handed them
[3:06:45] each a piece of candy and Mrs. Jensen
[3:06:48] looked on with a smile that probably
[3:06:50] hadn't crossed her face for a long time.
[3:06:54] She finally turned to us. God bless you.
[3:06:58] I know the Lord has sent you. The
[3:07:00] children and I have been praying that he
[3:07:04] would send one of his angels to spare
[3:07:07] us.
[3:07:10] In spite of myself, the lump returned to
[3:07:12] my throat and the tears welled up in my
[3:07:14] eyes again. I'd never thought of my
[3:07:17] daddy in those exact terms before,
[3:07:20] but after Widow Jensen mentioned it, I
[3:07:23] could see that it was probably true. He
[3:07:25] was an angel.
[3:07:28] I was sure that a better man than daddy
[3:07:30] had never walked this earth.
[3:07:34] I started remembering all the times he'd
[3:07:36] gone out of his way for mom and me and
[3:07:38] many others. The list seemed endless as
[3:07:41] I thought on it. Daddy insisted that
[3:07:43] everyone try on the shoes before he
[3:07:45] left.
[3:07:47] I was amazed when they all fit, and I
[3:07:50] wondered how he'd know what sizes to
[3:07:53] get.
[3:07:55] Then I guessed that if he was on an
[3:07:57] errand for the Lord, that the Lord would
[3:07:59] make sure he got the right sizes.
[3:08:03] Tears were running down Widow Jensen's
[3:08:06] face again when we stood up to leave.
[3:08:09] My daddy took each of the kids in his
[3:08:11] big arms and gave them a big hug.
[3:08:14] They clung to him. They didn't want us
[3:08:17] to go.
[3:08:19] I could see that they missed their
[3:08:21] daddy. I was glad that I still had mine.
[3:08:28] At the door, he turned to Witter Jensen
[3:08:29] and said, "The Mrs. wanted me to invite
[3:08:32] you and the children over for Christmas
[3:08:35] dinner tomorrow, Mrs. Jensen." The
[3:08:38] turkey will be more than the three of us
[3:08:40] can eat, and a man can get quite
[3:08:43] canankerous if he has to eat turkey for
[3:08:46] too many meals.
[3:08:49] We'll be by to get you about around
[3:08:51] 11:00.
[3:08:53] It'll be nice to have some little ones
[3:08:56] around again. Matt here, he hasn't he
[3:08:59] hasn't been little for quite a spell. He
[3:09:02] uh I was the youngest.
[3:09:05] My two brothers, two sisters, they had
[3:09:08] all gotten married, moved away.
[3:09:12] Mrs. Jensen nodded and said, "Thank you,
[3:09:15] Brother Miles. I I don't have to say,
[3:09:19] "May the Lord bless you. I know for
[3:09:22] certain that he will."
[3:09:25] Out on the sled, I felt a warmth that
[3:09:28] came from a deep within. I didn't even
[3:09:32] notice. I didn't even notice the cold.
[3:09:36] And when we had gone away, daddy turned
[3:09:39] to me and said, "Matt,
[3:09:42] I want you to know something, son.
[3:09:45] Your mother and me had been tucking a
[3:09:47] little money away here and there all
[3:09:49] year so we could buy that rifle for you,
[3:09:54] but we just didn't have quite enough,
[3:09:56] son."
[3:09:59] Then yesterday, a man who owed me a
[3:10:01] little money from years came by to make
[3:10:04] things square.
[3:10:07] Your mom and me were really excited,
[3:10:09] thinking that now we could get you that
[3:10:12] rifle. And I started into town this
[3:10:15] morning to do just that.
[3:10:19] But on the way, I saw little Jakey out
[3:10:22] scratching in that wood pile with his
[3:10:24] feet wrapped in those gunny sacks. And I
[3:10:27] knew what I had to do. Son,
[3:10:31] I spent that money for shoes and a
[3:10:33] little candy for those for those
[3:10:35] children.
[3:10:36] I hope you understand.
[3:10:39] Oh, I understood.
[3:10:42] And my eyes became wet again with tears.
[3:10:46] I understood very well. And I was so
[3:10:49] glad my daddy had done it.
[3:10:53] Now, the rifle seemed very low on my
[3:10:56] list of wants and priorities.
[3:11:00] He had given me a lot more. He had given
[3:11:04] me the look on Mrs. Jensen face and
[3:11:08] those smiles on her three children.
[3:11:12] For the rest of my life, whenever I saw
[3:11:16] any of the Jensen's or split a block of
[3:11:18] wood, I remembered.
[3:11:22] Remembering and remembering brought back
[3:11:25] that same joy I felt riding home beside
[3:11:30] of my daddy that night. He had given me
[3:11:34] much, much more than a rifle that night.
[3:11:39] He had given me the best Christmas of my
[3:11:44] life. The end.
[3:11:49] [applause]
[3:11:54] And I just wanted to say a couple of
[3:11:56] words before I let you go back to your
[3:11:58] seats.
[3:11:59] And uh there's one person that loves you
[3:12:03] more than your mom and daddy loves you,
[3:12:06] more than your mama and papa's and
[3:12:08] grandparents. Do you know who loves you
[3:12:11] the the best and the most?
[3:12:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:12:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:12:14] &gt;&gt; Right. And I if you were listening this
[3:12:16] morning, I read a scripture about when
[3:12:19] when some parents who had heard about
[3:12:22] Jesus,
[3:12:23] uh they didn't come just by themselves.
[3:12:26] They brought their children. Do you
[3:12:27] remember that?
[3:12:29] They brought their children to Jesus
[3:12:32] that he might touch them.
[3:12:36] And the disciples who were kind of like
[3:12:38] bodyguards to Jesus to kind of keep
[3:12:41] people away. Uh they were like telling
[3:12:45] the parents, "Why did you bring the
[3:12:47] kids? That's just more
[3:12:50] you don't need to have your kids here."
[3:12:53] Well, Jesus overheard
[3:12:56] and he he became upset.
[3:12:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:13:00] &gt;&gt; And he turned to his disciples and he
[3:13:03] said, "Allow the little children
[3:13:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:13:08] &gt;&gt; to come to me.
[3:13:10] &gt;&gt; And do not prevent them,
[3:13:14] for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
[3:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:13:18] And he said he took him took them up in
[3:13:21] his arms and and and he blessed them.
[3:13:27] That's how much Jesus loves children.
[3:13:31] &gt;&gt; So that means Jesus loves every one of
[3:13:35] you.
[3:13:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And of course, God so loved the
[3:13:39] world that he gave us Jesus,
[3:13:42] &gt;&gt; his only begotten son that whosoever
[3:13:45] believeth in him should not perish, but
[3:13:48] have everlasting life. So Jesus wants to
[3:13:52] he wants to know you as you get older
[3:13:56] and stronger and bigger and wiser and
[3:14:00] and he wants to make himself known to
[3:14:03] you. And he wants you to know him and
[3:14:07] through his word and by his spirit that
[3:14:10] he sent back to earth after he uh died
[3:14:14] and was crucified and rose from the
[3:14:16] dead. Where did he go after he rose from
[3:14:18] the dead?
[3:14:20] Did he go to heaven?
[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; But did he come back in the in in spirit
[3:14:25] form in the Holy Spirit? And that's what
[3:14:27] he wants you to understand [music] that
[3:14:29] you to have the Holy Spirit have have
[3:14:32] have the the real Jesus in you. Amen.
[3:14:38] So, how many loves Jesus? And how many
[3:14:41] knows Jesus loves you? Amen. Wonder if
[3:14:44] we could just sing that. Jesus loves me.
[3:14:47] This I know. Brother Kobe.
[3:14:51] Oh Jesus
[3:14:54] loves me. This I [singing] know.
[3:15:00] For the Bible
[3:15:04] tells me so. [singing]
[3:15:08] Oh little
[3:15:10] ones to him belong.
[3:15:16] They are weak but he is strong.
[3:15:22] [music and singing]
[3:15:23] Oh yes
[3:15:26] Jesus
[3:15:27] loves me.
[3:15:30] Oh yes [music]
[3:15:33] Jesus.
[3:15:35] How about it parents?
[3:15:38] Oh yes
[3:15:41] Jesus [music and singing]
[3:15:43] loves me.
[3:15:46] The Bible
[3:15:49] tells Oh, we have another verse.
[3:15:53] Oh, Jesus
[3:15:56] loves me. He who [singing] died,
[3:16:02] heaven's gates
[3:16:06] to open [singing and music]
[3:16:08] wide.
[3:16:09] For he
[3:16:11] has washed
[3:16:13] away my sin.

[3:17:27] of things. That's why we we work so hard

[3:22:31] so you know, when you start naming
[3:22:32] names, you just always miss somebody.
[3:22:34] But uh um the you know [music]
[3:22:37] Nathaniel, brother Nathaniel getting
[3:22:39] things together and trying to we we
[3:22:41] bought these cheap mics [music] uh for
[3:22:44] them to to wear this time which which
[3:22:46] was which was a blessing. Uh
[3:22:48] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:22:48] &gt;&gt; uh we couldn't we couldn't afford to get
[3:22:50] the um

[3:22:56] but we we've got eight of them running
[3:22:57] through one channel and uh uh and and he
[3:23:02] was scrambling around. Brother Nathaniel
[3:23:04] was having to buy parts and adapters
[3:23:06] [music]
[3:23:06] and whatever else to try to get things
[3:23:08] to work. And so we got them to work. And
[3:23:11] uh but the only thing is there's only
[3:23:13] one channel. So uh you know if if a
[3:23:16] person didn't have their theirs up to
[3:23:18] their mouth or they weren't talking loud
[3:23:20] enough, they were just all on one
[3:23:22] control.
