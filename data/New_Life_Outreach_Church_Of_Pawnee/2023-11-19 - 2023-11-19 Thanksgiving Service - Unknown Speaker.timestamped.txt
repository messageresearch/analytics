[29:06] you either
[29:17] one there we go probably don't need a
[29:19] mic uh used to being in the back but
[29:22] listen to brother uh Wendell this
[29:25] morning talking about you young people
[29:28] here in
[29:29] homeschooling um you don't realize the
[29:32] privilege I was about four years old
[29:34] five years old about 40 years ago um my
[29:38] mom and dad started
[29:40] homeschooling and I just remember
[29:41] sitting there it was blizzarding out I
[29:44] mean we just got done milking sitting
[29:46] there eating supper and deputy sheriff
[29:48] walks up knocks on the door and the
[29:50] local public school took my mom and dad
[29:53] all the way to Supreme Court of Michigan
[29:55] for homeschooling they took him to court
[29:56] for child labor and the Lord used that
[30:00] my dad was I mean in high school there
[30:02] went to public school and he said he was
[30:04] walking down the hallway in seventh
[30:05] grade and he heard a voice said when you
[30:07] grow up and have children homeschool
[30:09] your children and he turned around there
[30:10] was nobody in the hall so you may not
[30:13] realize the value of what you're getting
[30:16] but the Lord paved a way that you could
[30:19] have a good education and be protected
[30:22] um back home you know they've got a a a
[30:25] kitty litter box in the hallway in our
[30:27] local school there in in Lima light Ela
[30:31] but the Lord cares about you and he'll
[30:33] he'll make a way for you but that be I
[30:37] just was thinking about that this
[30:38] morning when you said that I mean didn't
[30:40] realize you know the
[30:41] the the reach from the Lord but um just
[30:45] here recently been struggling been
[30:47] working a lot and struggling been
[30:49] carrying a lot of load and it bleeds
[30:52] over into the family and my wife is was
[30:54] praying and last weekend I went down to
[30:56] Kentucky huntt and just trying to get
[30:57] away from work and trying to regain my
[31:00] my sanity and
[31:03] uh brother Tim puit was up and I was
[31:06] planning on being gone Sunday I mean I'd
[31:08] left Friday night he was planning on
[31:09] being gone come back Sunday night it's
[31:11] kind of what we're out here doing just
[31:13] kind of me and L are just enjoying
[31:14] ourselves but down there Amanda had went
[31:18] up for prayer and she said that she was
[31:20] just sitting in her seat you know just
[31:22] praying and had a bunch of thoughts
[31:24] going through her head and different
[31:25] things and she went up and I don't even
[31:26] remember what she went went up for
[31:27] prayer for her but she had went up for
[31:29] prayer and they prayed for that and then
[31:31] brother Jonathan came over and just
[31:32] started speaking straight to her and
[31:34] telling her you know ministering the
[31:36] exact thoughts of what she had thought
[31:39] in her seat so you may think that it
[31:41] doesn't matter you know what you're
[31:43] going through you know Lord don't think
[31:44] about you but the Lord hears every one
[31:47] of our thoughts so Sunday you know I
[31:49] come back I got home Saturday night I
[31:51] tagged out in Kentucky Saturday come
[31:52] back Saturday night and I'm sitting
[31:55] there and brother Tim's Minister and and
[31:57] and just a weight you know had been on
[31:59] my shoulders and it was like brother Tim
[32:02] was ministering straight to me and he
[32:03] kept looking at me and I'm in the sound
[32:05] booth is where I normally sat my back's
[32:06] against the wall I'm in the back of the
[32:08] church you know and uh so I I he kept
[32:11] looking at me just just looking straight
[32:13] at me and I said Lord you know I'm at my
[32:15] post of Duty you know I'll I'll come
[32:17] I'll come up after church so everybody
[32:20] had walked out and I walked back and I
[32:22] went to the office back there and the
[32:23] Lord met us back there in the office and
[32:26] just await I can't even begin to
[32:28] describe I guess the closest thing I
[32:30] could say is in Kentucky I'd carried
[32:31] 128b pack for a mile and 3/4 packing out
[32:34] my deer and the the what my legs felt
[32:37] like when I took that pack off that's
[32:39] what it feels like when the Lord will
[32:41] take a weight off your shoulders and
[32:43] he's mindful no matter what it is he's
[32:46] mindful I mean he's he's healed me he's
[32:48] he's put fuel in my tank you know
[32:51] praying going down the road penniless no
[32:52] money don't know where I'm going to get
[32:54] fuel for for putting in the truck and
[32:57] I'm on E and I drove past a gas station
[33:01] and I smelt gas fumes and I'm like great
[33:03] now what what's gone wrong now and I
[33:05] look down I watched my fuel gauge go
[33:07] from E to full and I was in a I was in a
[33:10] a Chevy with a 454 and they don't get
[33:12] good fuel economy I got 800 miles on
[33:14] that tank of fuel the Lord is mindful of
[33:17] every detail in our lives so just as an
[33:20] encouragement just keep pressing just go
[33:22] forward whatever the Lord puts you in
[33:24] just put your shoulder to the wheel so
[33:26] Lord bless you we love you
[33:31] all amen so glad he's mindful amen

[34:25] and uh the very
[34:27] building that we went with the minister
[34:29] that we went with at the orphanage there
[34:30] where we were ministering didn't have a
[34:33] roof on it they had a
[34:35] tarp uh over the you know where they
[34:39] were preaching and it went about halfway
[34:40] over the congregation and thank goodness

[34:47] have been soaked yeah and I'll I'll
[34:49] never forget that amen of of being there
[34:52] and thinking my goodness the nice
[34:54] buildings that we have the nice things
[34:57] that we have and here they are sitting
[34:59] on a dirt floor and now imagine when
[35:01] it's raining they're sitting on a dirt
[35:05] floor and they would
[35:08] walk to be there yeah sit there all day
[35:12] long oh man yeah we ought to be thankful
[35:17] that that's for
[35:18] sure but I was thinking about this being
[35:21] thankful and it coming up on
[35:23] Thanksgiving
[35:24] and and I have so much brother Wendell
[35:28] Saints to be thankful for I mean I could
[35:31] start all the way back from when I was a
[35:33] child to my parents I could start with
[35:35] my grandparents I could move all the way
[35:38] through through my mishaps in life and
[35:40] the things I chose to do that weren't
[35:42] right and and God delivering me and I
[35:46] mean we could take it yeah through the I
[35:51] there's not a step in my life brothers
[35:54] and sisters that I'm not thankful for
[35:57] God taking that step for
[36:00] me I could have been dead on the side of
[36:03] the street from the drugs but here I am
[36:06] right I could have wrecked my truck One
[36:08] Night in a drunk whatever you want to
[36:10] call it but he didn't let it happen that
[36:13] way I could have stepped over the
[36:15] boundary and said something against this
[36:17] message that I was raised in that would
[36:19] have booted me out for good but he
[36:21] didn't allow me
[36:23] to every step of my life
[36:27] has been him carrying
[36:29] me plain and simple all right but what
[36:33] I'm the most thankful for brothers and
[36:36] sisters is this
[36:38] message you say well you know really
[36:41] it's it's a message it's the scriptures
[36:43] it's the Bible and it is and I was
[36:45] raised in a message church I was raised
[36:47] in a message home I was taught the
[36:50] message I was beat the message if you
[36:53] would I was you know you're going to
[36:55] live it or you're not going to I mean
[36:57] you know what I mean it it now there's
[36:59] all types I mean you have some preachers
[37:00] that preach Grace and you have some that
[37:02] preach the law and it takes both law and
[37:04] Grace there you know what I mean but
[37:06] coming up
[37:07] through but once I finally
[37:12] realized what the message was telling
[37:15] me brothers and sisters and and if you
[37:18] don't mind i' I've got a a quote here
[37:21] from brother brandom and if you don't
[37:22] mind I'm going to I'm going to read it
[37:24] to you it's actually a prayer
[37:28] of his and it is in uh
[37:32] 1958 the W Watchman water of the night
[37:35] but this prayer and I keep it in my
[37:38] tablet I keep it on my phone I keep it
[37:41] in a little written thing in my desk I I
[37:43] have this prayer it says in this hour of
[37:46] Gloom over the Earth and destruction on
[37:48] every hand Lord God we are we just
[37:51] cannot express how we feel and the
[37:54] thankfulness and gratefulness in our
[37:56] heart that Jesus Christ came down from
[37:58] glory and was made like a man like we
[38:01] dwelt among us and then when he died for
[38:04] our sins come through the way of
[38:05] paradise and taken the waiting Souls
[38:08] broke through every spiritual power that
[38:10] the devil had bound the Earth with and
[38:12] made a streak so that the sunlight of
[38:15] God's Eternal Grace God's Eternal Grace
[38:20] I'm not just
[38:22] forgiven that day I'm forgiven the next
[38:25] time okay oh pray praise the Lord CU I
[38:28] make a lot of mistakes brothers and
[38:29] sisters I I
[38:32] do the sunlight of God's Eternal Grace
[38:35] could shine upon those who are willing
[38:37] to receive it God grant today that men
[38:40] everywhere where will hurry hurry get
[38:43] into the kingdom for the message has
[38:46] always been urgent hurry hurry come out
[38:49] the angel said in Sodom I can do nothing
[38:52] till you come hither Lord grant that
[38:55] though the message to be full of grace
[38:57] and power and love yet it's urgency
[39:00] Grant Lord that men may quickly come and
[39:03] receive Christ and be filled with the
[39:05] Holy Ghost for Jesus has said they that
[39:08] are of God hear the words of God may
[39:12] they come and repent of their sins be
[39:14] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:16] for the remission of their sins and be
[39:18] filled with the Holy Ghost to fix their
[39:21] soul in the condition that the first
[39:24] church was okay so shall it be when you
[39:29] come we're thankful for the message and
[39:33] pray that you'll bless it Lord to the
[39:36] good of our hearts and we as we wait on
[39:40] thee in Jesus name we pray amen and it's
[39:44] that right there and pray that you bless
[39:47] it and then he said as we wait on thee
[39:50] so when I first got this I was all
[39:52] excited and I put it back that means a
[39:54] lot you know Eternal Grace yeah
[39:57] but over the years as I studied the
[39:58] message and I studied the scriptures and
[40:01] I took what brother brandom said and
[40:03] then I went to the scriptures and I took
[40:04] the scriptures back to what brother
[40:06] brandom said and I'm not very smart so
[40:08] I'm thankful for an Old Kentucky
[40:10] hillbilly I promise you but as I'm
[40:12] studying this I realized that the
[40:14] scriptures don't
[40:16] lie come on and the message doesn't
[40:20] lie so it all boils down to this for me
[40:23] of what I'm thankful for the message
[40:26] message yes but what the message told me
[40:28] was is I didn't just one day trip over a
[40:34] scripture in the message and become a
[40:36] Son of God all right I didn't just wake
[40:39] up one day and God decide oh him yeah no
[40:45] come on what I realized that before the
[40:48] foundation of the world God wrote my
[40:52] name in his book and he said John Mary
[40:56] and Torrance and his family are going to
[40:59] get a new name I'm going to call them
[41:02] Mrs Jesus Christ and the Bible even says
[41:07] you know don't Rejoice that the Devils
[41:09] fall under your feet don't but Rejoice
[41:12] that your name's in the Lamb's Book of
[41:14] Life and brothers and sisters that's
[41:16] what I'm thankful for that's what my
[41:19] heart cries out to God when I'm on my
[41:21] knees thank you Lord for thinking of me
[41:24] before the foundation of the world
[41:26] because I couldn't do this on my own
[41:29] without Jesus Christ I would be nothing
[41:32] amen and I'm thankful for that amen God
[41:35] bless you all that's my thankful for
[41:37] this Thanksgiving

[54:19] right yall know the way that I preach I
[54:21] read a lot so we'll just go right into
[54:23] it uh Psalms 9 2 and verse one
[54:29] um Psalms 92 and verse one it is a good
[54:33] thing to give thanks unto the Lord and
[54:36] to sing praises unto thy name oh most
[54:41] high you know I was uh when brother
[54:46] Wendell uh talked to us about um being
[54:51] ready to come up and speak for just a
[54:54] few moments on being thankful
[54:58] um I I went upstairs into my Sunday
[55:01] school room with my youngest and was
[55:04] just kind of letting him run around the
[55:06] floor while I sat there trying
[55:08] to uh figure out what I could say and I
[55:11] had uh something pop my hand pop in my
[55:14] head that I remembered reading um and so
[55:17] I started looking online and to add a
[55:20] few things and um there was an article
[55:24] that was actually released uh the first
[55:27] of this month um so November 1st 2023 by
[55:32] the American Psychological
[55:34] Association um the article was entitled
[55:37] stress in America 2023 a nation
[55:40] grappling with psychological impacts of
[55:42] collective trauma um
[55:45] and one portion of this uh article um
[55:50] said that the survey revealed that those
[55:52] ages 35 to 44 reported that the most
[55:55] significant increase in chronic health
[55:57] conditions since the pandemic 58% in
[55:59] 2023 compared with 48% in 2019 adults
[56:03] aged 35 to 44 also experienced the
[56:06] highest increase in mental health
[56:08] diagnosis 45% reported a mental illness
[56:11] in 2023 compared with 31% in 2019 though
[56:15] adults age 18 to 34 still reported the
[56:17] highest rate of mental illness at 50%
[56:21] adults ages 35 to 44 were more likely to
[56:23] report that money and the economy were
[56:25] the factors that caused them significant
[56:27] stress today compared with
[56:30] 2019 and what had made me look into that
[56:33] and I found the the other article which
[56:35] was released in
[56:37] 2022 um also in November so basically I
[56:41] was released November 17th 2022 so
[56:43] exactly one year ago uh basically two
[56:46] days um in the mental health first aid
[56:50] USA uh they said research has shown that
[56:53] consciously practicing gratitude can
[56:56] reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in
[56:58] fact Studies have found that a single
[57:00] act of thoughtful gratitude produces an
[57:02] immediate 10% increase in happiness and
[57:05] a 35% reduction in depressive symptoms
[57:08] these effects disappear within 3 to 6
[57:10] months which reminds us to practice
[57:11] gratitude over and
[57:14] over now the Bible mentions the word
[57:16] gratitude 157 times um it mentions
[57:20] thanks or Thanksgiving 72 times and so
[57:25] here uh you know even as this year as
[57:27] the nation is going hey we have more
[57:30] people struggling with stress and more
[57:32] people struggling with mental illness
[57:34] and more people struggling with these uh
[57:36] with the the battlefield that that
[57:38] brother brandom talked about the
[57:39] battlefield was in the mind and so we
[57:41] knew this is where the enemy was going
[57:42] to be attacking us as they're talking
[57:45] about this more than ever one year ago
[57:48] they're saying wait if you just are
[57:50] thankful if you're just grateful it
[57:52] helps the whole situation well then if
[57:54] we go back to scripture if God talks
[57:57] about it 157 times for gratitude and he
[58:01] talks about it 72 times for thanks or
[58:03] Thanksgiving I think he was giving us a
[58:05] clue I think he was telling you here
[58:08] how's here's one of the ways that you
[58:10] battle is just be thankful be grateful
[58:13] be content where you're at this doesn't
[58:16] mean that you ignore the stresses that
[58:18] you're going on it doesn't mean that you
[58:19] ignore hey Lord I'm going through a hard
[58:21] time right now like our brother was
[58:23] talking about hey you don't IGN going
[58:25] and pretend that I have gas in my tank I
[58:28] acknowledge there's a problem hey Lord I
[58:31] have no gas in and I have no money to
[58:33] buy the gas there are problems here and
[58:37] I can't fix the problems all
[58:40] right right but then you're able to
[58:43] commit it to the Lord and the
[58:46] thankfulness of knowing that we have a
[58:48] God to hand it to we have a God that can
[58:51] take our stresses a God that can take
[58:53] our problems right when we are able to
[58:56] be have that thankfulness when we're
[58:57] able to have that faith in our creator
[59:00] you can drive by a gas station and your
[59:02] tank fills up without you ever stopping
[59:06] because it's still the same Jehovah he's
[59:08] still the same Jehovah Gyra he's still
[59:10] the Creator and he's still going to
[59:12] watch over his children in Matthew
[59:15] chapter 6 starting at verse 25 it says
[59:19] therefore I say unto you take no thought
[59:21] for your life what you shall eat or what
[59:23] you shall drink nor yet for your body
[59:26] what you shall put on is not the life
[59:28] more than meat and the body than rment
[59:30] behold the fowls of the air for they
[59:32] seow not neither do they reap nor gather
[59:35] into barns yet your heavenly father Feth
[59:38] them are ye not much better than
[59:42] them I've been uh going over with my
[59:46] Sunday school class we've been talking
[59:49] about uh in the The Book of John what
[59:52] are known as the seven I am statements
[59:55] that Jesus makes um and as we were going
[59:59] over that lesson today there was a a
[1:00:02] quote that I
[1:00:09] read if I can find it right
[1:00:20] here it was in the in the sermon the
[1:00:23] lamb and the dove brother brandom's
[1:00:25] preaching he says and the lamb has a
[1:00:27] great meaning I was over in Palestine or
[1:00:29] over in the orient rather and if you
[1:00:31] ever been went to the Orient and seing
[1:00:33] what the the Bible would become a new
[1:00:35] book to you if you ever studied it it's
[1:00:36] an oriental book written in Oriental
[1:00:38] Parables Parables and Customs they used
[1:00:40] in those days and they don't change
[1:00:42] they're just the same today one day and
[1:00:44] I a man and I were riding around in a
[1:00:47] little British Jeep and I heard the
[1:00:48] whistles blowing and everything stopped
[1:00:50] all the cars stopped and I said what's
[1:00:52] the matter and look to my surprise
[1:00:53] coming across the street was a Shepherd
[1:00:55] leading a bunch of sheep and I said well
[1:00:57] why and he said everything stops for the
[1:00:59] sheep and the shepherd over here then
[1:01:01] driving on farther I noticed a place
[1:01:03] where there was a Shepherd coming down
[1:01:04] through the street and over there they
[1:01:06] don't have the convenience that we have
[1:01:08] today to find ice boxes and so forth
[1:01:10] they put their vegetables and so forth
[1:01:11] right out on the street their goodies
[1:01:13] and here comes down the middle of the
[1:01:14] street a Shepherd walking right through
[1:01:16] those places leading his sheep not by a
[1:01:18] rope they were just following him by
[1:01:20] sight and I stopped and I was amazed and
[1:01:23] that Shepherd walked and he could step a
[1:01:25] few steps out to one side and then back
[1:01:27] into the path and the Sheep next to him
[1:01:29] would step out come back and the Sheep
[1:01:32] behind him would follow and they
[1:01:33] followed the shepherd my sheep know my
[1:01:35] voice and I was amazed and I said to the
[1:01:37] good man with me I said why do they not
[1:01:39] turn aside and eat some of those peirs
[1:01:40] they looked beautiful and the things
[1:01:42] that would entice the Sheep said they
[1:01:44] would in no wise touch anything until
[1:01:46] the shepherd first beded them to do so
[1:01:49] oh my there you are if God's sheep would
[1:01:51] just be that careful about things we
[1:01:53] wouldn't have so many different Scruples
[1:01:54] in our churches and things that's right
[1:01:58] you know the as we were going over that
[1:02:00] and talking about Jesus saying that I am
[1:02:03] the the Good Shepherd um we talked about
[1:02:07] Psalms 23
[1:02:09] and you know when you think about a
[1:02:12] Shepherd from our Western
[1:02:16] standpoint or if you're in Europe and
[1:02:18] you want to see how they're raising
[1:02:20] sheep you go and they have a large
[1:02:22] fenced pasture normally extremely green
[1:02:25] growing all the Sheep are within the
[1:02:29] fence and a Shepherd just has to stand
[1:02:31] there and watch
[1:02:33] them but when you go into the East and
[1:02:36] you go into the Middle East there aren't
[1:02:39] huge Green Pastures everywhere there's
[1:02:41] not a place where they just park them in
[1:02:42] a fence and that's where they leave them
[1:02:44] they have to lead them from mouthful to
[1:02:47] mouthful from place to eat to place to
[1:02:49] eat and the Sheep is fully trusting the
[1:02:53] shepherd going going okay he's going to
[1:02:55] lead me to where the next place is
[1:02:57] because if I graze in this section and I
[1:02:59] eat what's here it's then gone it's not
[1:03:02] huge Lush and green it's there's a
[1:03:04] mouthful here I walk a few more steps
[1:03:06] here's another mouthful I walk a little
[1:03:08] further there's another
[1:03:09] mouthful but it's relatively Barren and
[1:03:12] so the Sheep is trusting that the
[1:03:15] shepherd is going to lead him to the
[1:03:17] next place to the next provision to the
[1:03:20] next food to the next water he's going
[1:03:22] to lead him to shelter at the end of the
[1:03:24] night he's it's not from our Western
[1:03:26] mindset where hey we're in this Lush
[1:03:29] field everything is beautiful and green
[1:03:31] I know the Shepherds over on the side
[1:03:33] watching me but I can run around in the
[1:03:35] field and everything's fine in the
[1:03:37] Eastern mindset it goes I have to watch
[1:03:39] the shepherd I have to follow the
[1:03:41] shepherd or I don't get food or I don't
[1:03:44] get water or I'm not safe okay these are
[1:03:48] my choices I either look at the shepherd
[1:03:49] and follow him or I don't have provision
[1:03:52] I either look at the shepherd and follow
[1:03:54] follow him or I don't have
[1:03:57] safety and so when we look at these
[1:04:00] things you know being grateful for God
[1:04:03] providing we're also going hey I have to
[1:04:05] keep my eyes on him for that provision
[1:04:08] to come I have to keep following the
[1:04:10] steps that he's leading I have to keep
[1:04:12] going along when we have a world that is
[1:04:15] built around fighting and clawing to get
[1:04:18] that next dollar to be able to provide
[1:04:21] to be able to meet the needs
[1:04:25] we're the ones that are supposed to be
[1:04:26] resting and that doesn't yes we all go
[1:04:28] to work we go and we provide for our
[1:04:31] families the best we
[1:04:32] can but at the same time we are in our
[1:04:36] minds we should be going all right Lord
[1:04:37] I know this is coming from you I know
[1:04:38] you're the one providing the work I know
[1:04:40] you're the one providing the job
[1:04:42] whatever may
[1:04:43] happen I going back in my history I had
[1:04:47] a great job in Florida I was working in
[1:04:51] a paint store I was making great money
[1:04:53] working for a brother in the church
[1:04:55] church I made poor decisions at bad
[1:04:59] mistakes and ended up leaving that job
[1:05:02] and then I was trying to figure out how
[1:05:04] I was going to provide for my family
[1:05:06] because I messed
[1:05:08] up very clearly at that point be like I
[1:05:11] was the one who made poor decisions I
[1:05:13] wasn't going oh God's leading me to do
[1:05:16] this now God still used that for me but
[1:05:21] it was me making the poor decisions and
[1:05:23] so I end up working in fast food again
[1:05:27] and I didn't start out back at
[1:05:29] Chick-fil-A going yes I'm making so much
[1:05:31] money my family's well taken care of
[1:05:34] everything's provided for were
[1:05:37] great it was more of a look at the
[1:05:40] paycheck and go how in the world are we
[1:05:43] going to pay
[1:05:44] bills how in the world are we going to
[1:05:46] be able to put food on the table pay
[1:05:49] rent do these different things and
[1:05:52] working through those different
[1:05:54] steps and
[1:05:57] then God decides to move me to Alabama
[1:06:01] and I get to do it all over again start
[1:06:03] another new job and go again how am I
[1:06:06] going to make ends meet I was starting
[1:06:07] to build something over there and now
[1:06:08] I'm starting all over what's happening
[1:06:12] how is this going to
[1:06:15] work and we
[1:06:18] had the shepherd Watching Over Us each
[1:06:21] step of the way each part yes I'm
[1:06:24] struggling going I don't know how this
[1:06:26] is going to work I don't know how we're
[1:06:29] going to pay every bill I don't know how
[1:06:31] we're going to ride for every
[1:06:33] step and then eventually the Lord leads
[1:06:36] me here to Oklahoma and I take a pay cut
[1:06:38] to move to
[1:06:39] Oklahoma and once again I'm going all
[1:06:42] right Lord what are we
[1:06:44] doing anyone from the outside in the
[1:06:47] normal world looking at me would go
[1:06:49] you've made a wrong decision every
[1:06:50] single time cuz you've taken pay cuts
[1:06:53] every single time
[1:06:54] you're not supposed to move unless
[1:06:55] you're making more money that's the way
[1:06:58] it works you shouldn't be unless you're
[1:07:01] increasing unless you're getting better
[1:07:03] and yet each time we go we end up back
[1:07:05] in that place going okay
[1:07:08] Lord what are you supposed to do and I
[1:07:11] remember particularly in that first year
[1:07:12] that we moved here there were multiple
[1:07:14] times that I would be praying to the
[1:07:16] Lord going all right Lord you know we
[1:07:18] moved here to be at church and to be in
[1:07:20] Fellowship which means you got to figure
[1:07:22] out a way for me to have gas in my car
[1:07:24] to get to pawn e so that I can make it
[1:07:26] to these different fellowships cuz we
[1:07:28] have a lot of
[1:07:31] them I didn't realize how much
[1:07:33] Fellowship there was when I first moved
[1:07:35] here then I got here and I realized wait
[1:07:39] I'm driving there four or five times a
[1:07:41] week I'm going through a lot of gas but
[1:07:44] at the same time that's why we moved
[1:07:45] here so Lord if I'm supposed to be here
[1:07:48] you've got to provide cuz I can't
[1:07:52] because all the time I would have for
[1:07:53] second job is me going to Pon e to
[1:07:55] Fellowship so I can't do that either so
[1:07:59] Lord I'm trusting in you you have to be
[1:08:01] the shepherd you have to be the one to
[1:08:03] give the provision you have to be the
[1:08:05] one to take care of
[1:08:08] it and it's not easy and it's especially
[1:08:13] not easy if you start to let yourself
[1:08:15] evaluate your life through the lens the
[1:08:17] world
[1:08:19] uses I said in a sermon not long ago
[1:08:22] when we found out my wife is pregnant
[1:08:24] again my mind fell back into that lens
[1:08:26] and I started going well we don't have a
[1:08:29] house yet I am about to have another kid
[1:08:32] and we don't have any savings in the
[1:08:33] bank and we don't have this don't have
[1:08:35] this I'm just a failure this isn't
[1:08:38] working at
[1:08:40] all but then I had to remember it's not
[1:08:44] me making it work it's not about me yes
[1:08:47] God still requires that I get up and go
[1:08:50] to work and provide for my family the
[1:08:53] best that I
[1:08:55] can but then it comes down to me
[1:08:57] trusting the shepherd to okay Lord this
[1:09:00] is what I've
[1:09:01] got these are the bad decisions I've
[1:09:04] made in my life that cause these
[1:09:07] situations debts that have to be paid or
[1:09:10] whatever these are the situation
[1:09:12] decisions that I've made good because I
[1:09:14] was following you and I've ended up here
[1:09:17] and if this is where you want me then
[1:09:19] Lord You're
[1:09:21] providing all right and I'm trusting you
[1:09:23] to help me get through it and I'm
[1:09:26] trusting you to help me make the better
[1:09:29] decisions and when the world is so
[1:09:32] stressed out be still stressed by covid
[1:09:36] still stressed by the ramifications of
[1:09:38] what went through
[1:09:39] there yeah look I moved here and we were
[1:09:44] here a
[1:09:46] year and Co
[1:09:48] hit
[1:09:51] maybe I wasn't here that long it wasn't
[1:09:53] like we had built up a extreme amount of
[1:09:56] stability and the whole world falls
[1:09:59] apart everything's going
[1:10:02] wrong and yet somehow I'm placed in a
[1:10:06] business that's if anything even busier
[1:10:10] because of
[1:10:13] covid of all the restaurants in the
[1:10:15] world I could have worked at I'm at
[1:10:17] Chick-fil-A and Chick-fil-A somehow ends
[1:10:19] up being busier through Co when we have
[1:10:22] the dining room closed and we should be
[1:10:24] slower and we should be having to lay
[1:10:26] off employees and we should be having to
[1:10:27] do all these things and yet somehow my
[1:10:30] bills are being paid and somehow I'm
[1:10:34] taken care of and somehow things are
[1:10:36] going
[1:10:37] okay and the
[1:10:39] world would be looking at me going
[1:10:42] you're still working in a fast food
[1:10:44] place this isn't a great place to be
[1:10:47] this isn't a great way to provide for
[1:10:48] the
[1:10:50] family but yet it provides and I have
[1:10:54] been blessed my whole life that my wife
[1:10:57] has never had to work we made that
[1:11:00] commitment when we first got married
[1:11:02] that hey we want my wife wanted to be a
[1:11:04] stay-at-home mom she wanted to take care
[1:11:06] of the home she wanted to raise the
[1:11:08] kids and the same thing you commit it to
[1:11:11] the Lord and go okay Lord if this is
[1:11:12] what you
[1:11:13] want this is what you put on her heart
[1:11:16] I'm not going to fight against
[1:11:19] it but if that's what's on her heart
[1:11:22] then Lord that means you've got to help
[1:11:23] me
[1:11:25] provide when in a world where it's
[1:11:27] standard for two income families in a
[1:11:31] world where it's
[1:11:32] standard that to make ends meet you have
[1:11:35] to have two people
[1:11:37] working and yet
[1:11:39] somehow me working at a fast food
[1:11:44] restaurant the Lord meets our
[1:11:47] needs we have food on the table we have
[1:11:49] gas in the
[1:11:51] car now once again from the World
[1:11:54] standpoint there going to be lots of
[1:11:56] things that say we don't have much we
[1:11:57] only have one car we don't have multiple
[1:12:00] cars we are renting a house we are doing
[1:12:03] this we are doing that you can run down
[1:12:05] a laundry list of all the ways I am not
[1:12:07] Successful by the world standards we can
[1:12:10] run down a laundry list of how most
[1:12:12] everyone in this room is not Successful
[1:12:15] by the world
[1:12:20] standards but yet at the same time when
[1:12:22] we can go hey you know what I've got
[1:12:26] healthy
[1:12:27] kids I've got kids that get compliments
[1:12:30] from people when we go out because of
[1:12:33] hey they're well behaved wow they're so
[1:12:36] smart wow they're so uh articulate
[1:12:38] they're able to communicate well they're
[1:12:40] able to do these different things and I
[1:12:42] look at them and go yeah they're
[1:12:44] homeschooled my wife is teaching them no
[1:12:47] she doesn't have a college degree no she
[1:12:50] doesn't have any type of major higher
[1:12:52] education she just has the time and the
[1:12:55] care to give them like God
[1:12:58] designed and somehow God continues to
[1:13:01] provide for me with one
[1:13:03] job to make
[1:13:06] it the shepherd is making sure that we
[1:13:08] get that mouthful every step every few
[1:13:10] steps we get what we need he's providing
[1:13:13] the food he's providing the water and so
[1:13:15] when the world is stressing when the
[1:13:17] world is so
[1:13:19] upset and yet their own research says if
[1:13:23] you you can be grateful if you can be
[1:13:25] thankful if you can if you can put this
[1:13:26] into some of your mental practices it
[1:13:28] will help the
[1:13:30] stress and God in his word is telling
[1:13:33] you be grateful be thankful you don't
[1:13:37] need to worry about what science is
[1:13:38] telling you because I already told you I
[1:13:41] already gave you these instructions
[1:13:43] science is just confirming that guess
[1:13:44] what God was right what do we
[1:13:48] know Psalms 118 and verse one oh give
[1:13:52] thanks unto the the Lord for he is good
[1:13:55] because his mercy endureth
[1:13:57] forever Psalms
[1:13:59] 136
[1:14:01] verse1 oh give thanks unto the Lord for
[1:14:04] he is good for his mercy endureth
[1:14:06] forever oh give thanks unto the god of
[1:14:09] gods for his mercy endureth forever oh
[1:14:13] give thanks to the Lord of lords for his
[1:14:15] mercy endureth forever Psalms 105
[1:14:20] verse1 oh give thanks unto the Lord Lord
[1:14:24] call upon his name make known his deeds
[1:14:26] among the
[1:14:28] people why do we have a testimony
[1:14:32] service brother one was talking about
[1:14:34] hey this is the most we've had testimony
[1:14:35] services in a little while why because
[1:14:38] the scripture says make known his deeds
[1:14:40] among the people let them know what
[1:14:42] God's doing let them know God filled up
[1:14:44] a gas tank praise the Lord praise the
[1:14:46] Lord he can provide we've heard
[1:14:49] testimonies from different one about how
[1:14:51] God paid a bill they don't know where
[1:14:53] the money money came from they don't
[1:14:54] know how it it's paid but God paid the
[1:14:55] bill God did this God did that we don't
[1:15:00] do it to try to show well I'm so
[1:15:01] spiritual I was able to make this happen
[1:15:03] no we're going God it's all him he's the
[1:15:07] one who does it he's the one who somehow
[1:15:09] is able to help me pay bills and provide
[1:15:12] for my family and do all these different
[1:15:15] different things that according to the
[1:15:16] world standard shouldn't work it
[1:15:19] shouldn't work to have a one income home
[1:15:21] unless you're making hundreds of
[1:15:22] thousands of dollars it shouldn't work
[1:15:26] to be working at a fast food restaurant
[1:15:28] and providing for a family of six soon
[1:15:30] to be seven it shouldn't work to do
[1:15:34] these
[1:15:35] things it shouldn't work for all these
[1:15:37] brothers to be able to go out as
[1:15:39] electrical
[1:15:40] contractors in the same area and find
[1:15:43] enough work to be able to provide for
[1:15:45] their
[1:15:46] families but yet they
[1:15:49] do and they're not fighting each other
[1:15:51] to get the work right
[1:15:53] they're each doing their own thing and
[1:15:55] God's providing that shouldn't work
[1:15:58] they're in Pony America this isn't a big
[1:16:01] town this isn't a big area with you know
[1:16:04] lots and lots of people that are all
[1:16:06] looking for electrical
[1:16:08] work but yet somehow God provides gives
[1:16:11] them the work they need make sure that
[1:16:14] their families are taken care of make
[1:16:16] sure their bills are
[1:16:19] paid the world says it shouldn't work
[1:16:23] and we point over and go it's our
[1:16:26] Shepherd he's the one who provides he's
[1:16:28] the one who takes care and that's who we
[1:16:30] can be thankful for that's who we're
[1:16:32] thankful to that's what we're thankful
[1:16:34] for is that he's the one providing every
[1:16:37] step of the
[1:16:38] way 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse
[1:16:44] 16 Rejoice ever more pray without

[1:26:15] services and and singing Amen brother
[1:26:19] brandom says you want the Lord to appear
[1:26:21] come in your midst talk about him and I
[1:26:23] think the Lord gives us testimonies that
[1:26:25] we can brag on him a little bit and
[1:26:27] create an atmosphere where he can come
[1:26:29] and dwell Among Us
[1:26:31] amen but Exodus 6 and2 and these words
[1:26:35] which I command thee this day shall be
[1:26:38] in thine heart and thou shalt teach them
[1:26:41] diligently unto thy children and shall
[1:26:43] talk of them when thou sest in thine
[1:26:45] house and when thou west by the way when
[1:26:48] thou liest down when thou risest up and
[1:26:51] thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[1:26:53] thine hand and they shall be frontlets
[1:26:55] between thine eyes and then Thou shalt
[1:26:57] write them upon the posts of thy house
[1:26:59] and on thy Gates and as shall be when
[1:27:02] the Lord thy God shall have brought thee
[1:27:04] into the land which he swore unto thy
[1:27:06] fathers to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to
[1:27:09] give thee uh the great and good goodly
[1:27:11] cities which thou build us not Houses
[1:27:14] full of good things which thou fillest
[1:27:17] not Wells digg which thou digest not
[1:27:19] Vineyards and olive trees which thou
[1:27:21] plant not and when thou have eaten and
[1:27:24] be full then beware lest thou forget the
[1:27:27] Lord which brought thee out of the land
[1:27:29] of Egypt and from the house of bondage
[1:27:32] amen you you may be seated and you know
[1:27:35] I want to I want to start by we reading
[1:27:37] a little a little quote whenever I was
[1:27:39] in Poland I was able to go to the to the
[1:27:42] concentration camp owitz and they have a
[1:27:45] bunch of different phrases of the people
[1:27:46] that are left you know and this is one
[1:27:49] of them that just stood out to me he
[1:27:50] says those who do not remember remember
[1:27:52] the past or condemned to repeat it and I
[1:27:55] thought ma that is very very true
[1:27:57] because there's a lot of people saying
[1:27:58] gosh what's didn't happen the Holocaust
[1:28:00] didn't happen I think it was Dad that
[1:28:02] says if it didn't happen where' all
[1:28:03] those millions of people go you know but
[1:28:05] there was another quote that stood out
[1:28:07] to me one of them says there's people
[1:28:09] that are denying this didn't happen and
[1:28:11] she says I'm willing to crawl on my
[1:28:13] hands and knees to prove that this
[1:28:15] happened and I thought my it's something
[1:28:17] that somebody was passionate about that
[1:28:20] had happened and I remember it taking
[1:28:22] place and you know I I started thinking
[1:28:25] about some testimonies that has happened
[1:28:27] to us this year uh there was a you know
[1:28:30] as as an evangelist you don't you don't
[1:28:32] make much money you know people think we
[1:28:33] do but you don't make much money and
[1:28:36] there was a time we was out about a
[1:28:38] month or so and we just we didn't we
[1:28:40] wasn't going to able to pay the bills
[1:28:42] thank God for credit cards you know
[1:28:44] wasn't able to pay the bills when with
[1:28:45] offerings wer taking care of the the the
[1:28:48] expenses out on the road and there was
[1:28:50] two brothers that just that they called
[1:28:53] and said yo You Came Upon my heart and I
[1:28:56] want to give you an offering it ain't
[1:28:58] much I want you give you give you an
[1:29:00] offering another brother a couple weeks
[1:29:02] later said brother Josh you came up my
[1:29:04] heart and I want to give you an offering
[1:29:06] and as we got home we didn't have the
[1:29:08] money for the bills but those offerings
[1:29:10] were just enough to pay the bills and I
[1:29:13] start thinking about this scripture
[1:29:14] beware lest thou forget it's the little
[1:29:17] things that God brings us through the
[1:29:19] times that he heals us of a headache or
[1:29:21] heals us of a tummy ache you know I can
[1:29:23] think of times I was in school having
[1:29:25] headaches and ID say Lord please touch
[1:29:27] my head God would heal my head it's the
[1:29:29] little things that God lets us know that
[1:29:31] he's never going to leave us he's never
[1:29:33] going to forsake us but beware lest you
[1:29:36] forget there was another time we was out
[1:29:38] at the park and uh Ethan was running
[1:29:41] running on the on on the basketball
[1:29:43] court and it had just rained he had
[1:29:44] slipped and fell in the mud pudle landed
[1:29:46] right on his head his head started to
[1:29:48] swell he was crying balling me and
[1:29:50] Loretta got together together and as we
[1:29:52] started to pray he stopped crying and he
[1:29:54] took off running playing again and I
[1:29:56] grabbed him and looked at his head the
[1:29:58] swelling was gone the redness was gone
[1:30:00] it was God letting us know that no
[1:30:02] matter where we're at what we go through
[1:30:05] don't forget the little things and let
[1:30:07] me just encourage you tonight beware
[1:30:09] lest you forget the little things you
[1:30:11] know brother brandham tells the story of
[1:30:13] the magic flower he says there was a man
[1:30:16] that uh found a flower and the flower
[1:30:18] spoke to him you know I think it's a I'm
[1:30:19] guessing it's a story that's made up but
[1:30:21] the flower spoke to him and says I'll
[1:30:23] give you a wish but you got to keep me
[1:30:26] with you wherever you go and the man
[1:30:28] says well magic flower I want the
[1:30:30] mountains to open up and inside of those
[1:30:32] mountains I want there to be Treasures I
[1:30:34] want there to be be jewels and crowns
[1:30:37] and a bunch of treasures and the the
[1:30:39] magic flower spoke to him and said it
[1:30:41] will happen as you say but don't forget
[1:30:44] me I got to be with you wherever you go
[1:30:47] and he looked and the mountain opened up
[1:30:48] and inside of the mountain there was
[1:30:50] Treasures there was gold there was
[1:30:52] silver the there was there was diamonds
[1:30:54] and crowns and everything the man ran in
[1:30:56] there and he was picking up picking up
[1:30:58] the treasures picking up the gold
[1:31:00] picking up the silver and he he as he
[1:31:02] was leaving the entrance of the cave he
[1:31:04] heard a voice that says don't forget the
[1:31:06] most important thing and he says my okay
[1:31:09] okay so he let he let go of this and he
[1:31:11] picked something else up and as he was
[1:31:13] leaving The Voice says again don't
[1:31:15] forget the most important thing and he
[1:31:18] thought my what what am I forgetting
[1:31:20] what what am I got what do I got to
[1:31:22] leave behind he let go of something else
[1:31:25] and he and he picked this up and as he
[1:31:27] was leaving again the voice spoke again
[1:31:29] and says don't forget the most important
[1:31:32] thing and he says oh flower be quiet I
[1:31:35] don't need you no more I've got my
[1:31:37] treasure and as he left out of the cave
[1:31:39] he turned around and the cave closed and
[1:31:42] the flower was inside of it he had
[1:31:44] forgot the most important thing he had
[1:31:46] what he had in his hand but what all the
[1:31:49] supplies everything that was going to
[1:31:50] last for eternity everything that was
[1:31:53] going to last for the future was now all
[1:31:55] behind because he forgot the most
[1:31:57] important thing and I think my God has
[1:31:59] given us Health he's given us families
[1:32:01] he's given us he's GI he's provided all
[1:32:03] of our needs but if we forget the most
[1:32:06] important thing we can stand today with
[1:32:09] our health but what about tomorrow we
[1:32:11] can stand today with gas in our cars but
[1:32:13] what about tomorrow we can stand today
[1:32:16] with their bills being paid but what
[1:32:18] about tomorrow don't forget the one that
[1:32:21] has brought you out of bondage don't
[1:32:22] forget the one that has given you health
[1:32:24] given you a family that has given you
[1:32:27] children that that that had sanity we
[1:32:29] you know a fear of mine is is one of our
[1:32:32] children being born and not being mental
[1:32:35] not not being right and I think God is
[1:32:37] giving me two children that have their
[1:32:39] right mind they can talk there they can
[1:32:41] sing and I think my don't forget the
[1:32:44] little things not every child is born
[1:32:47] with the right mind don't forget that
[1:32:49] God has brought you this far don't
[1:32:51] forget about the magic flower so to
[1:32:54] speak don't forget you see it's memories
[1:32:57] that that that push you in a direction
[1:32:59] you see as a child you can't talk you
[1:33:02] can't walk you can't crawl but a child
[1:33:05] learns certain things and as he begins
[1:33:07] to crawl memories is reminding him how
[1:33:10] to crawl as I walk it's my memory
[1:33:12] teaching showing me how to walk it's my
[1:33:15] memory telling me how to talk if you
[1:33:17] ever lost your memory you would forget
[1:33:20] those things but it's memory that is
[1:33:22] pushing you in a direction and I started
[1:33:25] to think about brother brandham brother
[1:33:27] brandham says whenever his cross-eyed
[1:33:29] baby was about to die and his wife had
[1:33:31] died you know he says there was never a
[1:33:34] crosseyed baby that come before him in
[1:33:36] the prayer lines that God never did heal
[1:33:39] because he remembered his crossy baby it
[1:33:43] was memory that would bring on a
[1:33:45] compassion and bring on a love that he
[1:33:48] could express a healing power to that
[1:33:51] through through those people and I think
[1:33:53] about Jonah it was Jonah's testimony
[1:33:56] that brought salvation to the land that
[1:33:58] he went through you know brother
[1:34:00] brandham says that all of Nineveh was
[1:34:02] worshiping the Sea Gods and whenever the
[1:34:05] welcome rote his tongue upon the seash
[1:34:07] shores and Jonah walked out upon the
[1:34:09] shores saying repent preaching repent
[1:34:12] repent or perish it was his testimony
[1:34:15] that brought us salvation to that people
[1:34:18] cuz how he wouldn't have got there on
[1:34:21] the Gods if he wouldn't have backslid
[1:34:23] you it was his testimony that brought
[1:34:26] salvation to that land and don't forget
[1:34:30] if God's delivered you from drugs beware
[1:34:32] lest you forget if God's delivered you
[1:34:34] from alcohol beware letest God forless
[1:34:37] you forget if God has filled you with
[1:34:40] the Holy Ghost beware Les you forget how
[1:34:44] God has brought you out I think of the
[1:34:46] woman at the well it was the woman at
[1:34:48] the well the Bible says the men of the
[1:34:50] city believe on Jesus because of the
[1:34:53] woman's testimony he has told me all the
[1:34:56] things that I have ever done and if you
[1:34:59] think about it what did Jesus tell the
[1:35:01] woman at the well she just told her past
[1:35:04] the only thing that he told the woman at
[1:35:06] the well that she had five husbands and
[1:35:09] the one that he was she was with now
[1:35:11] wasn't even hers so you would think she
[1:35:14] would have been ashamed to express that
[1:35:16] you think she would have been
[1:35:17] embarrassed to tell the men of the city
[1:35:20] that she has f husbands and and the and
[1:35:22] this one knows about it but since she
[1:35:25] realized that there was something
[1:35:27] Supernatural that took place at the well
[1:35:30] she was willing to let the city know
[1:35:32] that there is a man that can save there
[1:35:34] is a man that can deliver don't be
[1:35:37] ashamed of what God has done for you if
[1:35:40] God has brought you through trials don't
[1:35:42] be ashamed to let the let the people
[1:35:45] know about what God has done for you you
[1:35:47] know I think of this scripture in Psalms
[1:35:50] 37 and 25 five I have been young and now
[1:35:53] I am old yet I have not seen the
[1:35:55] righteous forsaken nor is seed begging
[1:35:58] bread he is merciful and lendeth in his
[1:36:01] seed is blessed his seed is blessed
[1:36:05] that's a promise that we can remember
[1:36:07] and grab a hold of for the Brandon would
[1:36:09] say God is true to his promise no matter
[1:36:12] what he has to do he'll bankrupt the
[1:36:15] heavens before he will let his word go
[1:36:17] defeated he'll never he never made a
[1:36:19] promise he can't keep I'm the Lord that
[1:36:22] heals all thy diseases if thou lay hands
[1:36:24] on the sick they shall recover if thou
[1:36:27] can't believe all things are possible so
[1:36:30] I think we need to stop remembering the
[1:36:33] things that we that our trials our
[1:36:35] circumstances and remember what God has
[1:36:37] done for us you see memory will push us
[1:36:40] in a direction God didn't save us to
[1:36:43] lose us God didn't deliver us for us to
[1:36:46] go back into bondage but we can see the
[1:36:48] children of Israel that come out of
[1:36:50] Egypt and then they got through some
[1:36:52] hard times and the Bible says let us get
[1:36:54] a captain and go back to Egypt they
[1:36:58] forgot about how God brought plagues
[1:37:01] upon the land how God turned water into
[1:37:03] blood they forgot about it and was
[1:37:06] willing to go back to where they come
[1:37:08] from and that quote I wrote at the I
[1:37:11] read at the beginning those who don't do
[1:37:13] not remember the past or condemned to
[1:37:16] repeat it it's a cycle that we got to
[1:37:19] break it's a cycle of life and death we
[1:37:21] are going to break we remember that God
[1:37:24] come and paid the price for our sins to
[1:37:27] break the cycle of death and one day
[1:37:29] we're going to step out of this Natural
[1:37:32] Body and step into eternity don't forget
[1:37:36] what God has done for us this evening
[1:37:39] don't forget to look up and see where
[1:37:41] your help comes from Brother brandom
[1:37:43] talks about the hog that is eating the
[1:37:45] apples and he never looks up to see
[1:37:47] where the apples come from and I think
[1:37:49] my if there's anything that we need to
[1:37:51] remember it is what God has done for us
[1:37:54] and the Bible would say this here and
[1:37:57] Deuteronomy 7:16 and thou shalt consume
[1:38:00] all the people which the Lord thy God
[1:38:02] shall deliver thee Thine Eyes shall not
[1:38:05] have no pity upon them neither shalt
[1:38:07] thou serve their gods for they shall be
[1:38:10] a snare unto thee and if Thou shalt say
[1:38:12] in thine heart these nations are more
[1:38:14] than I how can I dispose of them and
[1:38:17] thou shalt not be afraid of them but
[1:38:19] shalt well remember remember what the
[1:38:22] Lord God done unto Egypt or done unto
[1:38:24] pharaoh and unto all of Egypt he's
[1:38:27] saying when you come against something
[1:38:30] that you do not know how to get through
[1:38:32] just remember if you come to a
[1:38:34] circumstance that you don't know if
[1:38:36] you're going to make it through just
[1:38:37] remember if you come to a spot and your
[1:38:40] children are sick just remember how God
[1:38:43] healed them before if you come to a spot

[1:44:02] like to start here in
[1:44:04] Philippians uh 4 six and just a real
[1:44:09] easy passage of scripture here but it's
[1:44:12] just something that kind of come to my
[1:44:13] mind and but it reads like this here in

[1:44:22] joy and Crown so stand stand fast in my

[1:45:10] peace of God which path all
[1:45:13] understanding shall keep your heart and
[1:45:15] mind through Jesus Christ and I did have
[1:45:18] one more scripture it's in Luke in the
[1:45:20] 17th chapter um again another another
[1:45:25] passage of scripture we're all familiar
[1:45:27] with but in Luke 17 and
[1:45:30] 11 get here in just a
[1:45:33] minute it says here and it came to pass
[1:45:36] as he went through Jerusalem and he
[1:45:38] passed through the midst of Samaria and
[1:45:40] Galilee and he had entered into a
[1:45:42] certain Village there met him 10 men
[1:45:44] that were leopards which stood AAR off
[1:45:46] and they lifted up their voices and said
[1:45:48] Jesus Master have mercy Mercy on us and
[1:45:51] when he saw them he said unto them go
[1:45:54] show yourselves unto the priests and it
[1:45:56] came to pass as they went they were
[1:45:58] cleansed and one of them when he saw
[1:46:01] that he was healed turned back and with
[1:46:04] a loud voice glorified God and he fell
[1:46:07] down on his face and his feet giving him
[1:46:11] thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus
[1:46:14] answering said were there not 10
[1:46:17] cleansed but there are only but where
[1:46:20] are the nine and they are not found that
[1:46:23] who return to give glory to God save
[1:46:26] this stranger amen and you know I was
[1:46:29] thinking about this little passage of
[1:46:31] scripture and of course our main text
[1:46:32] here this evening would be Thanksgiving
[1:46:35] and and I have a lot to be thankful for
[1:46:37] as much as you know as you guys and and
[1:46:40] you know I have a few things that kind
[1:46:42] of was brought to my mind this past year
[1:46:44] and I was um one of the things was
[1:46:47] during our youth meeting I was um there
[1:46:50] just kind of helping out wherever needed
[1:46:52] you know chairs and food and you know
[1:46:54] getting the kids all into bed and you
[1:46:56] know turning the lights on and you know
[1:46:58] making our rounds and different things
[1:47:00] and and uh you know sometimes doing
[1:47:03] those kinds of things you you get
[1:47:04] wrapped up in your responsibilities
[1:47:06] rather than the service and and um but
[1:47:09] one thing in this meeting that really
[1:47:10] Stu out to me you know and I was um just
[1:47:14] going through some things in my mind and
[1:47:16] I'm sure that many of us do that you
[1:47:18] know that the Lord is you know is
[1:47:20] you know he he he's he's had his day
[1:47:22] with you Etc you know and and and I was
[1:47:25] sitting in the service and our brother
[1:47:27] it was brother Andrew that was preaching
[1:47:29] and and he was up there and he's just
[1:47:31] preaching away you know and he's all
[1:47:33] soaked and he's wet you know and he's
[1:47:35] just preaching away and and uh he began
[1:47:37] to end the service and he come up and he
[1:47:39] had offered prayer and you know some
[1:47:42] youth had come up and they had been
[1:47:44] prayed for it and I noticed that he was
[1:47:45] standing up there you know and I just
[1:47:47] kind of walked up there and just kind of
[1:47:48] gave him a little bump and was like hey
[1:47:50] man are you you know you done or you
[1:47:52] know um he's like no there's one more
[1:47:54] and I began to think you know and I was
[1:47:57] like you know that's that's the heart of
[1:47:58] a minister you know that's that's
[1:48:00] wonderful you know and that's great but
[1:48:01] you know you he still got three other
[1:48:03] meetings to go and and uh we don't want
[1:48:05] our you know our preacher all blown out
[1:48:07] you know so I kind of start giving him
[1:48:09] the I put my arm around him you know
[1:48:11] just kind of start walking him you know
[1:48:13] down the deal and he's like no there's
[1:48:14] one more and he he turns and he looks at
[1:48:16] a girl and he begins to pray for her and
[1:48:18] he begins so I you know I just kind of
[1:48:20] help him out and you know just kind of
[1:48:22] sing you know in prayer and just kind of
[1:48:24] keeping the atmosphere going and he gets
[1:48:25] done and he begins to look up and and
[1:48:28] he's like no he's like that one's not it
[1:48:30] so I was like you know if we don't get
[1:48:31] him out here he's going to be praying
[1:48:33] for everybody you know in this whole
[1:48:35] church and we got food going you know
[1:48:36] the cook you know it's time to eat and
[1:48:38] that's my one bill it's going off you
[1:48:40] know and it's about time to eat you know
[1:48:42] we got to get the minister out of here
[1:48:43] you know and and uh he's like no there's
[1:48:45] one more and so you know he's standing
[1:48:47] I'm standing next to him so I kind of
[1:48:51] you know and he just he kind of gets the
[1:48:53] hint he starts walking he's like no he's
[1:48:55] he's like no there's one more I was like
[1:48:57] yep yep that's that's
[1:48:59] wonderful you know and I kind of give
[1:49:01] him another little shove and then he
[1:49:03] goes no and then and then I I go back
[1:49:05] and I kind of go back to give him a real
[1:49:07] good shove and kind of go like this and
[1:49:09] he plants his foot and I'm like Wham I
[1:49:13] like okay all right well if this is the
[1:49:16] leading of the Lord I definitely don't
[1:49:17] want to be pushing against it and he
[1:49:18] goes she's right there and it was
[1:49:22] Elana and um kind of taught me a little
[1:49:26] something you know and it was like the
[1:49:28] Lord spoke to me he said the promise was
[1:49:31] UN to thee and to thy seed and I began
[1:49:35] to think about that and that that moment
[1:49:37] I I became very little it was kind of
[1:49:40] how brother Brandon talks about coming
[1:49:42] into the presence of God and and about
[1:49:44] how that you know that whenever you come
[1:49:45] into the presence of God that it's not
[1:49:47] something that you're bous it's not
[1:49:49] something that you're it's not something
[1:49:51] that but but you become almost as a dead
[1:49:53] man you know and and almost and at that
[1:49:56] moment right there I felt I felt God
[1:49:58] coming down and and begin to speak to my
[1:50:01] heart and just let me know that you know
[1:50:03] not only not not done with you I'm not
[1:50:05] done with your family and I'm not done
[1:50:07] with your wife and I'm not done with the
[1:50:08] church and I'm not done with with these
[1:50:10] other things and you know and and at
[1:50:12] that moment I just felt I felt I was
[1:50:15] very thankful that the Lord would speak
[1:50:17] to me specifically in them situations
[1:50:20] and that's what God does when he's when
[1:50:22] he's when he's talking to you and and
[1:50:24] and you begin to take these little
[1:50:25] experiences as just as well you know
[1:50:28] this is you know this is just you know
[1:50:30] just something happen chance you know
[1:50:32] it's just so happens and we live into
[1:50:34] such a society that oh we're just so
[1:50:36] lucky and oh we just are just lucky
[1:50:38] there's millions of people that are
[1:50:41] around this world but yet we come in
[1:50:42] contact with this message you know and
[1:50:44] you think about it how that when Jesus
[1:50:46] was on the earth I think a 16th of the
[1:50:48] of the population actually knew that he
[1:50:50] was even there but yet the disciples
[1:50:52] were the one oneon-one with him and yet
[1:50:54] we get to spend oneon-one with the
[1:50:56] message day by day or listening or or
[1:50:59] hearing God's voice and you know that
[1:51:01] was just one thing and I have a few
[1:51:03] things that's written down here and and
[1:51:05] the other day you know everybody knows I
[1:51:07] was having some issues with my truck I
[1:51:09] think this is like the third
[1:51:10] transmission I've been through and and
[1:51:12] uh and and then I had on my third one
[1:51:14] you know I had this little thing where
[1:51:16] it would the the shifter would pop off
[1:51:18] it would pop off and and I would have to
[1:51:20] literally get underneath the truck and I
[1:51:22] would have to put the little thing on
[1:51:24] the transmission you know so it would
[1:51:26] shift back and forth and and I got to
[1:51:28] doing it back got to doing it and and
[1:51:30] just it just became second nature I knew
[1:51:32] that after the third time I you know
[1:51:34] that I'm going to have to go underneath
[1:51:35] the truck and I'm going to have to do
[1:51:37] this and and I wasn't thinking and I had
[1:51:39] the truck turned on I think Joe was
[1:51:40] there yeah Joe was there and and Jonah
[1:51:43] you know Jonah was there and they were
[1:51:44] in the job and they were going and and I
[1:51:46] left the truck on which keeps power to
[1:51:48] the transmission and I got went under
[1:51:49] underneath the truck and and in order to
[1:51:52] get the in order to get the shifter
[1:51:54] cable on there you have to engage the
[1:51:57] shifter and push it all the way to the
[1:51:58] front well when I was underneath it when
[1:52:00] I was underneath it I grabbed the
[1:52:01] shifter and I put it in reverse and the
[1:52:04] truck began to roll and it and it R and
[1:52:06] it and and I was like is this moving I
[1:52:09] was like this truck moving and and it
[1:52:11] was and I was underneath it and and I
[1:52:14] grabbed the I grabbed the thing and I
[1:52:15] pulled myself out from underneath it and
[1:52:17] then not only that but it was rolling
[1:52:19] towards a telephone pole and so I had to
[1:52:21] I had to get in the truck and stop it
[1:52:23] all at one time and I was just thinking
[1:52:25] that quick that quick not paying
[1:52:28] attention that quick just could have got
[1:52:29] rolled over you know that quick and you
[1:52:31] know and I began to think about those
[1:52:33] things about how that the stories where
[1:52:35] there's they talked about you know uh uh
[1:52:38] men you know being being on the train
[1:52:40] tracks and how that you know God was
[1:52:42] dealing with them in their lives and how
[1:52:44] they you know they had their head on the
[1:52:45] train tracks and and you know God just
[1:52:48] miraculously pulled them off the tracks
[1:52:50] in time and I begin to thank you God you
[1:52:51] were dealing with that individual thank
[1:52:53] you for dealing me with like this taking
[1:52:56] care of me and and you know I be and
[1:52:58] another thing that kind of stood out to
[1:53:00] me is is that you know we were um we
[1:53:03] went to I can't remember where we were
[1:53:05] going but we were out of town and I
[1:53:06] think it was Lauren Jonathan's we were
[1:53:08] going to Lauren Jonathan's and we had
[1:53:10] stayed in a motel and and I was there
[1:53:12] and you know of course the big highlight
[1:53:14] for the kids is a swimming pool man man
[1:53:17] I don't care what they're doing they're
[1:53:18] being haved they're eating all their
[1:53:19] food and everything cuz they're going to
[1:53:21] the swimming pool you know and and and
[1:53:23] and all the kids got together and they
[1:53:25] they'd went out there that I had the
[1:53:27] three younger ones and I'm they're in
[1:53:29] the pool and and and they're just
[1:53:31] playing along the you know where the
[1:53:32] steps are and then you know just having
[1:53:34] a good time and all these things and and
[1:53:36] then all of a sudden you know I begin to
[1:53:37] look and I look over and I think Noah's
[1:53:40] touching the top of the steps but I'm
[1:53:43] not sure that he's touching the top of
[1:53:45] the steps and I began to look cuz he'd
[1:53:46] been quiet for a little while and I just
[1:53:48] realized that man he was just in the
[1:53:49] deep in he just struggling to getting
[1:53:52] all he could see was just the tips of
[1:53:53] his eyes you know just over the thing
[1:53:55] and and I was just thinking that quick
[1:53:57] that quick that quick and I began to
[1:54:01] think that that it was the Lord that it
[1:54:04] was the Lord that caught my attention
[1:54:06] you know and I'm not going to sit here
[1:54:07] and say oh because I've got you know
[1:54:09] super senses or I've got this or I'm a
[1:54:11] great dad or I'm a horrible dad you know
[1:54:14] I'm a horrible husband I'm a horrible a
[1:54:16] lot of things but the only thing that
[1:54:18] makes me who I am is God
[1:54:20] you know whatever that might be you know
[1:54:22] I'm not quite sure you know but but it
[1:54:24] was the Lord and you know and I began to
[1:54:26] think of um about one time you know that
[1:54:29] and this is minute but you know I was in
[1:54:31] I was asleep and you know Noah was there
[1:54:34] in the bed and and um and all of a
[1:54:37] sudden it was just like the Lord woke me
[1:54:38] up in the middle of the night and as I
[1:54:40] look over he's sliding head first off
[1:54:43] the bed as I just happened to wake up
[1:54:46] and the Lord's like the Lord spoke to me
[1:54:48] he's like you think that's a coincidence
[1:54:50] idence no no no and there's a lot of
[1:54:53] things in our lives that we could look
[1:54:55] at we could say is that just a
[1:54:56] coincidence no you know there's a lot of
[1:54:58] people there's a lot of people's
[1:54:59] children that drowned there's a lot of
[1:55:01] people that just get ran over in their
[1:55:03] vehicles working on it there's a you
[1:55:05] know there's a there's a lot of people
[1:55:06] who don't even know that God's dealing
[1:55:08] with their children but God specifically
[1:55:10] pointed to me out and said no look you
[1:55:12] know I was trying to get the man out the
[1:55:14] to I was trying to get the man out the
[1:55:15] service you know I was trying to get him
[1:55:17] on and get him out of there but God was
[1:55:18] like no I got something to say to you
[1:55:20] through him you know and and that's and
[1:55:22] I'm thankful for these things and you
[1:55:24] know I began to think about the story
[1:55:26] you know we was talking about you know
[1:55:27] the leper or we was talking about
[1:55:29] Thanksgiving and I begin to think about
[1:55:31] how that these leopards you know there
[1:55:32] was 10 of them and they all had a need
[1:55:35] every one of them had a need and the
[1:55:36] need meter the need meter was there
[1:55:38] therefore they came and they ran to him
[1:55:40] and said to have mercy upon us and every
[1:55:43] one of us who know knows who the need
[1:55:44] meter is and if you're not if you're in
[1:55:46] church long enough you'll find who it is
[1:55:48] you know it's not your Pastor you know
[1:55:50] it's not your it's not your your brother
[1:55:52] or your sister but we come here for
[1:55:54] needs that can't be met you know by by
[1:55:56] by a person's physical ability but it
[1:55:58] we're all in places in our lives that
[1:56:01] it's going to take a supernatural touch
[1:56:03] from the Lord to be able to do something
[1:56:05] and I began to think about how this
[1:56:06] leper how he had come but he out of all
[1:56:09] 10 then Jesus said Jesus says weren't
[1:56:11] there not 10 you know or wer there you
[1:56:14] know where's it where's the other nine
[1:56:15] you know how come you because he had
[1:56:18] something within him to give God glory
[1:56:20] because he realized where that come from
[1:56:22] and here this evening we have a lot of
[1:56:24] things like our brother was pointing out
[1:56:26] that in India they have tarps over the
[1:56:28] they have tarps over over the church but
[1:56:30] yet here we sit in an air conditioned bu
[1:56:32] building given to us by God and and
[1:56:35] about how that we have we have cars and
[1:56:38] some of us have so many cars we don't
[1:56:39] even want to tag them you know about how
[1:56:41] many you know some of us you know we've
[1:56:43] got you know we've got we've got we've
[1:56:44] got food we've got so much we've got so
[1:56:47] much food we want the commodity cheese
[1:56:48] you know I mean because that's the good
[1:56:50] stuff you know we know we know all we
[1:56:52] got so much food you know we've got
[1:56:54] shoes we've got we've got shirts we've
[1:56:57] got pants we got belts that don't fit
[1:56:59] we've got just all we've just got all
[1:57:01] these kinds of things and but yet but
[1:57:03] yet it's all it's all for us to get not
[1:57:06] be able to say oh I've provided this
[1:57:08] thing you know I make x amount at the
[1:57:10] end of at the end of the week I'm going
[1:57:12] to go take my family out to dinner but
[1:57:14] yet one thing that kind of stands out to
[1:57:16] me was when Israel was crossing the
[1:57:18] Jordan River that when they crossed the
[1:57:20] Jordan River God didn't tell them to do
[1:57:22] anything but he says I want you to lay
[1:57:24] these Stones up he says I want you to
[1:57:27] lay these Stones up because there's
[1:57:29] going to become a generation come behind
[1:57:31] you and they're going to ask where these
[1:57:32] Stones came from and you're going to say
[1:57:34] that on this day the Lord provided for
[1:57:37] us an ability and that's what we're
[1:57:39] doing in this Thanksgiving time this is
[1:57:41] what all of us are doing with our
[1:57:42] testimonies and all of us are doing
[1:57:44] about giving up because there's many you
[1:57:46] know you we talk about God filling up
[1:57:49] the gas can and God coming and putting
[1:57:51] tank in you know putting fuel in the
[1:57:53] tank but you know what I was told that
[1:57:55] story by Brother Duran years ago about
[1:57:57] how that how that God he was he was
[1:58:00] serving the lord and he was doing the
[1:58:01] working as you know God just asked you
[1:58:03] to work you know you know God will
[1:58:06] provide your needs God will provide
[1:58:08] whatever you have need of whether it's a
[1:58:09] check coming in the mail or whether it's
[1:58:11] whatever it might be he'll be the one
[1:58:13] that provides and you know what the Lord
[1:58:15] long time ago told showed him that the
[1:58:18] that the that the needle would go from E
[1:58:20] and it came all the way from all the way
[1:58:23] to all the way to fool you know and to
[1:58:25] me that's a stone that's something that
[1:58:27] I can look into and say Lord I'm broke
[1:58:29] Lord I I ain't got it all together and I
[1:58:31] ran out of gas and I've done this but
[1:58:33] you did this for brother Duren and
[1:58:35] you're not a respector of persons that
[1:58:37] if I've met you on the same grounds that
[1:58:39] you'll be able to meet me and you can
[1:58:41] feel my tank up and these stones that
[1:58:43] we're laying here this evening are
[1:58:45] something that every one of these young
[1:58:46] people can sit here and say if they've
[1:58:48] done it for brother Donald or if they
[1:58:49] done it for our brother Timothy or if
[1:58:51] they' done it for Joshua amen then God
[1:58:53] will do it for me and that's what I'm
[1:58:56] thankful for that we have a provider
[1:58:58] Jehovah Gyra he was made Jehovah Gyra
[1:59:01] before you even came to Earth because he
[1:59:03] knew that you would have a need and here
[1:59:06] this evening I'm thankful that God can
[1:59:09] meet the needs of his people and I'm
[1:59:10] thankful that the Lord is here and he's
[1:59:13] touching lives and he's touching Hearts
[1:59:15] still today because the scripture says
[1:59:18] that he's the same yesterday yesterday
[1:59:19] today and forever and that's what I Rely
[1:59:22] Upon and that that's God's blessings in
[1:59:25] our lives and and not only that now we
[1:59:27] can talk about a lot of a lot of fleshly
[1:59:30] things that were you know we could talk
[1:59:31] about a lot of things to where you know
[1:59:33] we have this and we thank God for that
[1:59:36] you know and if we're not careful we
[1:59:37] thank God for our wants we thank God for
[1:59:40] oh you know Lord I really thank you for
[1:59:42] you know providing the me the ability to
[1:59:44] put this accessory on my truck you know
[1:59:46] or Lord I really want to thank you you
[1:59:48] know for me to be being for providing me
[1:59:50] to be able to have you know uh uh you
[1:59:53] know a Nerf gun you know or being able
[1:59:55] to provide to have this or but but what
[1:59:57] about the real needs you know what about
[2:00:00] you know don't be the scripture says you
[2:00:02] know don't be don't be uh don't don't be
[2:00:04] amazed that the that the that the devils
[2:00:07] are cast out in your name but be glad
[2:00:09] that your name's written on the book of
[2:00:11] life because he's bringing it down to
[2:00:13] the essentials and that's where it's at
[2:00:15] is like like Joshua was saying he says
[2:00:18] that you know your child could have been
[2:00:20] born a certain way but yet God prevented
[2:00:22] it you know you know or or or you might
[2:00:25] not some people's kids don't even serve
[2:00:27] the Lord but yet we're filled with a
[2:00:28] church where people of of children that
[2:00:31] serve the Lord and love the Lord and we
[2:00:33] can bring them to a place where they can
[2:00:34] see the reality of God and and and and
[2:00:37] we can see him in his fullness and and
[2:00:40] so you know the real thing that I feel
[2:00:42] like that you I'm thankful for besides
[2:00:44] some of these things is is that God was
[2:00:47] has his word and he's able to to open it
[2:00:49] up till we can see and that is something
[2:00:52] important because not many people see
[2:00:55] the essence of the message right not a
[2:00:58] lot of people see what the message is
[2:01:00] really about it's not just a story about
[2:01:02] a possum right you know it's not just a
[2:01:05] story about you know God coming and
[2:01:07] pushing away a storm you know he a you
[2:01:09] know it's not just a story about you
[2:01:11] know him being able to you know Peg a
[2:01:14] you know Peg Bullseye head on or being
[2:01:16] able to Peg the end of a 22 but yet it
[2:01:18] was a call falling out of a people and
[2:01:20] the important thing is is that the
[2:01:22] people were able to respond and the only
[2:01:26] way that you're able to respond is if
[2:01:28] God put that seed within you and if God
[2:01:30] put that seed within you and gave you
[2:01:32] the ability to respond there's where our
[2:01:35] thankfulness is is that Lord out of
[2:01:37] millions of people amen out of millions
[2:01:39] of Native Americans that that are here
[2:01:41] you know and I'm sure there's there's a
[2:01:42] lot of other ones in Methodist churches
[2:01:44] we've got we've got our our brothers
[2:01:46] that are here out of millions of out of
[2:01:48] millions of electricians or or wherever
[2:01:50] you want to put yourself in the category
[2:01:52] that you want to that you're that you're
[2:01:53] in you could sit there and say God spoke
[2:01:55] to me through this message there's
[2:01:57] there's something that's screaming out
[2:01:59] that's calling me Lord I'm thankful for
[2:02:02] that I'm thankful because you could
[2:02:04] still be sitting under a bridge but yet
[2:02:05] you're a
[2:02:07] king just is what it is I mean you could
[2:02:10] you could be sitting there with no food
[2:02:11] on the table and you could be eating the
[2:02:13] crumbs and and cutting out or eating the
[2:02:15] last bit of canned food but yet God's
[2:02:17] but yet God's already got picked out
[2:02:18] what om you you belong him amen because
[2:02:21] it's the meek that inherits the Earth
[2:02:23] and and you know and these are just some
[2:02:25] things that just were brought to my mind
[2:02:27] and and um as our brother gets ready to
[2:02:30] come uh I would just like to close or
[2:02:33] stop by saying that you know God's been
[2:02:36] good to us this year amen he's provided
[2:02:39] many of our needs and many of our needs
[2:02:42] physically and yet spiritually and so I
[2:02:45] just like to leave you with that
[2:02:47] thought
[2:02:53] amen did you enjoy
[2:02:55] that amen well have you enjoyed yourself
[2:02:58] thus far

[2:04:15] God God bless you brother Caleb you may
[2:04:17] be seated
[2:04:20] hey man I got a couple testimonies in my
[2:04:23] family um I've recently just become
[2:04:26] self-employed and so uh I uh haven't had
[2:04:30] a whole lot of work but just a little
[2:04:32] bit of work here and there but I haven't
[2:04:33] got behind on any bills or nothing like
[2:04:35] that and I've heard a lot of horror
[2:04:37] stories of people first starting off so
[2:04:39] I just want to thank him for being my
[2:04:42] provider and then I got some testimonies
[2:04:44] concerning my children I remember when
[2:04:46] kylin was young he had a a seizure I
[2:04:48] don't know if everybody remembers that
[2:04:50] we had to take him to the hospital and
[2:04:52] we we prayed over him he had never had a
[2:04:54] Caesar since
[2:04:55] so and um Madison this one time we was
[2:05:00] all in Virginia and uh after Sean's camp
[2:05:03] meetings we was over at that uh condo
[2:05:07] that he rents and uh Madison was playing
[2:05:10] around in the shallow water the only
[2:05:12] halfway older person there was Ruthie
[2:05:15] and Madison fell in the deep water and
[2:05:16] was starting to go Downstream and M
[2:05:19] can't swim you know and Ruthie reached
[2:05:20] down there and grabbed her and pulled
[2:05:22] her
[2:05:23] out and then this other time concerning
[2:05:26] Micah we was uh he was probably one just
[2:05:28] learning to walk and I was working on
[2:05:32] the house outside and I had a 12ft
[2:05:34] ladder leaning against the house and the
[2:05:36] wind blew that ladder over and uh it
[2:05:39] fell on top of Micah but it landed right
[2:05:41] in the top rung like just landed right
[2:05:43] around him and you know how heavy them
[2:05:45] 12ft ladders are and so I just think
[2:05:48] thank the Lord for his providing and
[2:05:50] protecting
[2:06:07] Powers

[2:16:51] Caleb you girls sister Tracy I've always
[2:16:55] told everyone I said oh if you ever hear
[2:16:57] sister Tracy sing that woman can sing
[2:17:01] amen and
[2:17:03] uh praise the Lord so we're just we're
[2:17:08] just have a lot to be thankful for now
[2:17:12] um it's we we usually dismiss on
[2:17:14] Wednesday night but what we do is we
[2:17:16] just we move the Wednesday night service
[2:17:18] up to Tuesday night and this will give
[2:17:21] this gives everyone the opp the sisters
[2:17:24] opportunity to to be cooking for their
[2:17:26] families or whatever the events are and
[2:17:29] so uh so we're going we're going to move
[2:17:32] the Wednesday night service up to
[2:17:35] Tuesday and um uh we usually have a lot
[2:17:39] of uh Martins crawling around uh pawy uh
[2:17:44] around Thanksgiving but we uh Sean John
[2:17:47] Jonathan and Elina none of them are
[2:17:49] coming this year and so we just mama's
[2:17:53] going to be crying all week long and uh
[2:17:56] but um uh so it's we hate that um
[2:18:01] because usually we get them we get them
[2:18:02] to preach for us amen and so um we we
[2:18:07] had the last few call and just you know
[2:18:10] of course when you're dealing with
[2:18:12] pastors and and uh things can always
[2:18:15] change and and so we just hate it that
[2:18:18] brother Jonathan and and brother sha and
[2:18:22] they won't be here to or any of the
[2:18:25] family um from out of state so you know
[2:18:28] we're uh that that's sort of that's
[2:18:30] that's we're used to having Pony with
[2:18:33] about 50 Martins crawling around and but
[2:18:36] uh amen but we're we're but we're glad
[2:18:39] to be here and glad GL glad that that
[2:18:41] that God's given us health and and we're
[2:18:44] looking forward to what God has so um
[2:18:47] now just you know this is probably the
[2:18:50] wrong time to be ask taking a a vote so
[2:18:53] we're probably not going to do it
[2:18:55] tonight but for the for the new year
[2:18:57] service we usually we've been having a
[2:18:58] New Year service here for for some time
[2:19:02] but we have been invited over to a
[2:19:04] meeting in um at at brother
[2:19:08] Tony
[2:19:11] um huh Roberts Tony Roberts is is having
[2:19:17] a new New Year's uh
[2:19:20] Revival and so this is not this is not
[2:19:23] going to be New Year's Services um but
[2:19:26] this is going to be Saturday and
[2:19:28] Sunday I am wondering who would
[2:19:32] be
[2:19:33] um and and and we're and we're still
[2:19:36] trying to um we we always look forward
[2:19:39] to that New Year's uh uh men cooking
[2:19:42] breakfast thing and um so here's here's
[2:19:46] what I'm there's my propos position for
[2:19:48] us to think
[2:19:49] about if we went up there for a for a
[2:19:52] Saturday night and a Sunday
[2:19:55] morning New Year's New Year's Eve is on
[2:19:59] Sunday New Year's Day is on Monday so we
[2:20:05] could we if we went up there for a
[2:20:07] service on Saturday night and and
[2:20:10] there's a lot they've got all kinds of
[2:20:14] um
[2:20:15] um air air be and Bs up there that maybe
[2:20:19] two or three families can can go in
[2:20:21] together and rent rent some of those and
[2:20:24] it would maybe you know I'm just I'm
[2:20:26] thinking out loud here we got two weeks
[2:20:28] uh before this happens um we could go
[2:20:32] for the Sunday Saturday night Sunday
[2:20:35] morning we would be supporting them and
[2:20:38] then come back uh we could we could be
[2:20:42] back get us a good night's rest and
[2:20:43] still have our our our Monday morning uh
[2:20:48] breakfast if everyone wanted to do
[2:20:50] something like that
[2:20:53] um it's it's it's an opportunity for
[2:20:57] Fellowship that we've not that we've not
[2:21:00] always had it's the place that
[2:21:04] brother um black goes to church that's
[2:21:07] where the blacks go also um brother
[2:21:11] Wheeler's youngest boy um son goes goes
[2:21:16] there Britney and Matt and we all know
[2:21:19] Britney and Matt and um Britney um you
[2:21:25] you know we've we've known her since a
[2:21:26] real little and and we love we really
[2:21:29] love both of them and
[2:21:32] um and then brother Jeremy Shriner is
[2:21:36] going to be the preacher so he's going
[2:21:38] to be preaching so it would be just a it
[2:21:40] would sort of be like a little a little
[2:21:42] reunion and it would also be a blessing
[2:21:45] to a sister Church and um so I want us
[2:21:48] to think about it we don't have to I I I
[2:21:51] I would like to um
[2:21:54] uh I need to let brother know here real
[2:21:58] soon uh what we're going to be doing I I
[2:22:00] just wonder is there would there is
[2:22:03] would would there be um a favor toward
[2:22:05] doing something like that does does that
[2:22:07] sound like it'd be something that that
[2:22:09] you all would would would like to
[2:22:12] do it's it's in um it's in vanban
[2:22:17] uh which is about did you look that up
[2:22:20] earlier someone in the office was
[2:22:21] looking that up
[2:22:23] earlier to two and a half to three hours
[2:22:27] okay so it' be about the same distance
[2:22:29] that Noel would be I have a feeling that
[2:22:32] if we if
[2:22:34] we um sort of organized it I bet we
[2:22:37] could probably get some some other
[2:22:39] friends over there you know to um to
[2:22:43] make it a wonderful time um if if it's
[2:22:47] not something that the majority can do
[2:22:50] or would want to do
[2:22:52] then um we wouldn't make it a church
[2:22:55] effort you know but if but I you know I
[2:22:59] would I would really like for us to do
[2:23:01] it as a church effort if we could and um
[2:23:05] uh I just I just know it would be a
[2:23:07] blessing uh for them brother black is
[2:23:11] really looking for Fellowship the church
[2:23:12] is looking for fellowship and so um this
[2:23:16] would be a wonderful opportunity to get
[2:23:19] sort of get us out of our comfort zone
[2:23:20] too we've been doing it here for so long
[2:23:23] and um others have had it and never
[2:23:25] never invited us and and so we just got
[2:23:28] our feelings hurt and said all right
[2:23:29] we'll start having our own and uh and so
[2:23:33] uh well we didn't really get our
[2:23:34] feelings hurt but there we we we tried
[2:23:38] to invite ourselves to one one time we I
[2:23:40] called Pastor up I here I hear you've
[2:23:42] got you've got one going i' I'd like to
[2:23:45] bring the church over and he said well
[2:23:46] sir it's this is a private deal and I
[2:23:49] said okay all right praise the Lord so
[2:23:53] uh wasn't saying praise the Lord but uh
[2:23:57] so it would be something to to think
[2:23:59] about it's not like you would have to go
[2:24:01] to work the next day and um um and and
[2:24:06] it would be well it's a lot of fun it's
[2:24:09] it's it's a lot of fun to get out and
[2:24:12] and um especially if a couple families
[2:24:14] went on an Airbnb and I'll just tell
[2:24:16] everybody you don't have to pay those
[2:24:17] prices I never hardly ever pay the I
[2:24:20] don't pay the what they're offering or
[2:24:23] what what's on there I amen always on
[2:24:26] the comments below give them a
[2:24:28] price and they'll usually accept it amen
[2:24:32] so that's the tip for me praise the Lord
[2:24:35] all right
[2:24:38] amen well what how are we going to get
[2:24:41] this back spiritual as we dismiss
[2:24:44] amen
