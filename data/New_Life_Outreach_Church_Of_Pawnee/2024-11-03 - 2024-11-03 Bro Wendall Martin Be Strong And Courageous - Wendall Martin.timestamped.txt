[45:36] that land only be strong and of great
[45:41] courage amen I I I want to say God's
[45:43] original plan and purpose was for
[45:46] courageous men and women amen God's
[45:48] original plan that word courageous means
[45:51] amen not deterred by danger or pain it
[45:55] means brave
[45:57] Fearless Valiant
[46:00] lionhearted amen that's the kind of men
[46:02] and women that God's raising today amen
[46:05] that's the kind of teenagers God's
[46:06] raising today amen courageous men that
[46:10] are not going to be deterred by danger
[46:14] not deterred by pain not deterred by
[46:18] these kinds of things but vant in their
[46:22] heart now the opposite of courageous
[46:24] amen is cowardly amen it it it it means
[46:28] fainthearted spineless timid fearful so
[46:33] so the opposite of courageous amen is
[46:36] what
[46:37] fainthearted
[46:39] spineless timid fearful hey well praise
[46:44] the Lord can you say
[46:45] Amen so I as I was thinking about the
[46:49] about the service today amen as we're
[46:51] going to have communion here tonight I I
[46:55] think there is a amen there there is
[46:57] something that is that that we should be
[47:00] very Vigilant against and that is the
[47:03] spirit of
[47:04] lukewarmness Amen if there is something
[47:06] that we need to take courage against
[47:08] today is that Spirit of lukewarmness
[47:11] Amen remember second Thessalonians reads
[47:14] amen because they did not receive the
[47:17] love of the truth amen God would send
[47:20] them strong delusions to believe a lie
[47:24] thinking that they're right now thinking
[47:27] they're right but they would be damned
[47:29] by the LIE amen that they are believing
[47:33] and so when you lose your love for God
[47:37] do you realize that love for your
[47:39] brother and love for God is connected
[47:41] together amen that's right when you lose
[47:44] your love for God you lose your love for
[47:46] your brother amen when you lose your
[47:49] earnestness for God you lose that
[47:52] sincerity Amen in your prayer for your
[47:55] brother and the conditions that your
[47:58] neighbor is in you lose that because the
[48:01] love of uh for fellow man can only the
[48:05] genuine love for for your fellow man can
[48:07] only come from God himself amen a this
[48:11] this lay out of see a love is is is me
[48:14] me me me lay out a seal of I'll love you

[48:20] God's love I I he's just telling you
[48:22] here today I want you to be strong and
[48:26] very courageous
[48:27] the love that I have for you is the same
[48:30] love that I've always had for you amen
[48:33] this is God saying it now amen what I
[48:36] started out with on you I don't care
[48:38] your trials I don't care amen your
[48:40] failures I don't care where you are I
[48:43] want you to know when I start out loving
[48:45] somebody I'm going to keep on loving
[48:48] them well that should make anybody be
[48:50] courageous when you lose your love for
[48:52] your God you lose your love for others
[48:55] amen then you are nothing better than a
[48:58] beast or an animal amen because they
[49:01] can't love the way a a a Son of God can
[49:04] love they can't give the way a Son of
[49:07] God can give but you can because you are

[57:35] days so many are getting so hard because
[57:39] they have not realized the effect of
[57:43] this last day he says it's time to draw

[1:06:55] that when when they were to take that
[1:06:56] lamb before the altar amen and that and
[1:07:00] and and and they had two they had the
[1:07:02] horns of the altar the
[1:07:04] believer would bring that lamb and the
[1:07:07] priest would come and slay the
[1:07:10] lamb amen slid its throat usually they
[1:07:13] didn't have knives back then so they had
[1:07:16] rocks amen and they they would jab the
[1:07:20] Rocks Jag that lamb is is is trying to
[1:07:24] get away amen they gnaw at the throat
[1:07:27] blood squirting all over the place
[1:07:31] amen and and and the believer blood all
[1:07:34] over the believer blood all over the
[1:07:35] priest amen but that lamb was struggling
[1:07:39] for its
[1:07:40] life I think sometimes am man it
[1:07:44] represents two things one thing Christ
[1:07:46] the lamb died for you and then the
[1:07:49] Apostle Paul says now our reasonable
[1:07:50] service is to go and die on the same
[1:07:53] Rock and go die on the same Rock Amen
[1:07:56] that our lamb died on Abel died on the
[1:07:59] same rock that his that that his his

[1:08:13] Calvary can be exalted in me and in my
[1:08:17] life can you say amen amen oh yes amen

[1:08:23] you know why God says take courage when
[1:08:25] you're right there amen and you're
[1:08:26] gurgling and your and your body's die oh

[1:08:34] the Gold's going through the fire amen
[1:08:38] and it's going through the pressure what
[1:08:40] is God doing he is taking the draw out
[1:08:44] of your
[1:08:48] life praise the Lord the only problem
[1:08:51] with the elect is the elect lives in a
[1:08:53] body

[1:09:49] that is going to have a love for him his
[1:09:53] truth and his people more than anything

[1:38:21] okay you might be old fashioned in your
[1:38:23] dressing dress up like a lady they might
[1:38:26] say look at that old Holy Roller don't
[1:38:29] you worry she's got something that that
[1:38:32] little old sex Queen that's got all that
[1:38:35] world looking at her out there she
[1:38:37] hasn't got it she can never have it she
[1:38:40] is lost eternally she is doomed see
[1:38:43] she's never you got moral you got virtue
[1:38:47] she's got nothing she's got a bait
[1:38:50] that'll trap the lost souls into hell
[1:38:52] and the blind walks into it you've got
[1:38:56] something can I hear an amen
[1:39:00] sister that's right you're
[1:39:04] tired you get
[1:39:06] weary but when God wanted to show an
[1:39:09] expression there's some things that only
[1:39:11] you sisters can do not going to hold you
[1:39:14] uh uh too much longer now but God you
[1:39:17] you you God expresses himself through
[1:39:19] men as in as a strong
[1:39:21] leader but he also expresses
[1:39:24] himself through you women and your love
[1:39:27] Jesus Jesus when he wanted to express
[1:39:29] himself to Israel as he's sitting on top
[1:39:31] of the mountain and he's looking down
[1:39:32] over Jerusalem and he's weeping and he's
[1:39:34] saying and he's crying out Jerusalem
[1:39:36] Jerusalem how of I would have gathered
[1:39:38] thee but thou wouldest not I would have
[1:39:40] taken thee as a hin mother dust her
[1:39:46] brood I would have loved
[1:39:49] you I would have sheltered you I would
[1:39:54] have done it just like a mama would do
[1:39:57] her very own
[1:39:59] children but you wouldn't do it can you
[1:40:02] say
[1:40:04] amen I think I think a woman expresses
[1:40:06] this right here Lamentations
[1:40:08] 3:22 it is the Lord's
[1:40:11] mercies that we are not consumed because
[1:40:13] his compassions fail not and they are
[1:40:16] new every
[1:40:19] morning Mama gets so tired she goes to
[1:40:21] bed she said I've had enough this is it
[1:40:23] next morning there she is right back up
[1:40:25] taking care of her
[1:40:28] family it's because there's something
[1:40:30] about you that is expressing
[1:40:34] God can I tell you something what else
[1:40:36] God you you've got the attention of God
[1:40:37] there in 1 Peter 3 and 4 he says but let
[1:40:40] it be the hidden heart of the the hidden
[1:40:43] man of the heart in which is not
[1:40:47] corruptible even the
[1:40:49] ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit
[1:40:54] which is in the sight of
[1:40:58] God of great
[1:41:02] price that's
[1:41:04] something that is given to you
[1:41:08] sisters can you say amen
[1:41:11] amen a Believer who
[1:41:14] knows who they are becomes a pillar in
[1:41:17] the house in the home in the in the
[1:41:21] church can you say
[1:41:26] amen I hope I'm encouraging you sisters
[1:41:28] here for a minute I don't go to sleep on
[1:41:31] me quite
[1:41:34] yet it's your Nazarite
[1:41:39] vow you want the anointing of God upon
[1:41:42] on
[1:41:44] you in your place you bring his
[1:41:49] anointing upon your
[1:41:51] family it's your your
[1:41:54] call it's where your anointing lies your
[1:41:58] husband feels the serenity in you your
[1:42:01] children feels the love through you amen
[1:42:05] mostly important God sees himself
[1:42:08] expressed through you can I hear an
[1:42:16] amen good thing about a metal roof you
[1:42:19] can always enjoy the rain
[1:42:21] amen amen
[1:42:25] I know this sounds crude but it's a
[1:42:29] powerful
[1:42:32] statement and I think it should be
[1:42:34] liberating for you
[1:42:36] sisters in the midst of this of this
[1:42:40] evil age where the women's lib has so
[1:42:45] pushed their
[1:42:48] agenda and it and it makes a a real
[1:42:52] woman
[1:42:56] feel feel
[1:43:00] useless
[1:43:02] unfulfilled brother brandham in knoweth
[1:43:05] it not right this is this is 8:15
