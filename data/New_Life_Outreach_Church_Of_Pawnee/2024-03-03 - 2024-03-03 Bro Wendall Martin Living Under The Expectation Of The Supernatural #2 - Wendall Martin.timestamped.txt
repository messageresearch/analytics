[37:36] verse and
[37:40] um this is a familiar passage of
[37:43] scripture and we're going
[37:46] to maybe continue on a little bit on
[37:49] expectation
[37:51] tonight and um um we'll see how far uh
[37:57] we get along I
[38:00] um man we're um I've just learned a long
[38:05] time ago when the devil starts raring up
[38:07] his head I um Hallelujah I'm still a
[38:11] fighter and we're all fighters and we're
[38:14] just we just have to resist that clown
[38:17] he wants to try to get you to turn
[38:18] around and I preached on expectation
[38:20] this morning and I'm going to preach on
[38:22] expectation again
[38:23] tonight but um so um I've I've had um my
[38:29] my stomach's just been a little upset
[38:32] these last few weeks and and um it's not
[38:35] sickness I don't uh but you know it's
[38:38] happened three or four times where it
[38:40] just it gets you know my stomach just
[38:43] gets really sour and um and so
[38:47] Hallelujah and but uh but we're
[38:51] Overcomers and um and so he just picked
[38:55] the wrong day to do that this evening so
[38:59] I'm only saying that because somebody
[39:01] had prayed for us tonight and so I just
[39:02] thought I'd let you know I'm not dying
[39:04] I'm just uh amen but if I end quickly or
[39:11] uh amen praise the Lord all right James
[39:15] 5 and
[39:19] 14 um 13 is any among you Afflicted let
[39:23] him
[39:24] pray is any married let him sing
[39:27] Psalms is any sick among you let him
[39:30] call for the Elders of the church let
[39:33] them pray over him anointing him with
[39:35] oil in the name of the Lord the prayer
[39:39] of faith shall save the sick the Lord
[39:41] shall raise him up and if he ha
[39:43] committed any sins they shall be
[39:44] forgiven him confess your faults one to
[39:48] another pray for one another that ye may
[39:50] be healed the effectual fervent prayer
[39:53] of a righteous man aileth much El Elijah
[39:56] was a man subject to like passions as we
[40:00] are and he prayed earnestly that it
[40:02] might not rain and it rained not on the
[40:06] Earth by the space of three years and
[40:08] six months and he prayed again and the
[40:12] heaven gave rain and the Earth brought
[40:15] forth her fruit amen can you say Amen to
[40:19] that let's go to the Lord in prayer
[40:22] father we thank you for your love today
[40:26] thank you you for your such Bountiful
[40:29] blessings to us and Lord we come with
[40:32] expectation tonight to see you and we're
[40:35] asking Lord that you would just be in
[40:37] everything that is done and said pray
[40:39] Lord that you would father just
[40:42] um let your angels be among us here
[40:45] tonight we give ourselves to you now in
[40:49] Jesus name we pray can the church say
[40:52] amen amen God bless you you may be
[40:55] seated
[40:56] under
[40:58] expectation man for the
[41:01] supernatural I begin to think as I have
[41:06] have
[41:07] prepared um sometimes the greatest
[41:11] Miracles come amen out of
[41:16] desperation lots of times the greatest
[41:19] Miracles come most of the time I must
[41:22] say that the greatest Miracles are are
[41:26] when there are uh when when you are
[41:31] getting desperate it seems like
[41:34] desperation clears the air for us to see
[41:36] what's really important amen many of
[41:39] times we don't really we get caught up
[41:42] in the Affairs of life and we get we we
[41:46] get to a point to where we get little
[41:49] too
[41:50] self-sufficient and as we get
[41:52] self-sufficient we lose sight of the
[41:55] supernatural
[41:57] amen and so and that's and that's been
[42:00] that's been the that's that's been the
[42:03] cycle of of generations you look at all
[42:06] through the Old Testament amen there was
[42:09] the cycle of death and Revival death and
[42:12] Revival it was a it was a cycle that
[42:14] went amen um uh the God would send
[42:19] Revival and then they would then they
[42:21] would be on the mountain for a while
[42:23] then they would go back down and then
[42:25] God would have to get them in Des
[42:26] eration and then and and and things
[42:28] would would come and so amen of course
[42:32] we're we're living in the in the uh New
[42:36] Covenant but with the New Covenant we're
[42:39] we we we we've got more of a
[42:42] stability our stability is found in that
[42:45] new birth amen they didn't have the new
[42:48] birth in the old Covenant so amen they
[42:50] were still dealing with their they were
[42:52] under the law of sin and death amen so a
[42:56] prophet would come bring them back in
[42:58] line with the word of God and then amen
[43:02] uh they would they would stand there and
[43:04] repent and say I will not do it again
[43:07] and I'm going to serve God and then
[43:09] after a while they would begin to Veer
[43:12] back off and amen and and and then uh go
[43:16] into sin and captivity and then
[43:18] desperation and so amen but we're living
[43:21] under a new the the new law it's the law
[43:25] of life that is found in Christ Jesus
[43:28] our lord amen this this new law is a law
[43:33] that that overcomes sin and death amen
[43:38] they didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[43:40] Ghost back in the old Covenant but you
[43:43] have been washed not by the blood of
[43:45] bulls and goats but you have been washed
[43:49] by the blood of Jesus Christ God's
[43:52] perfect
[43:53] sacrifice amen and so when you've got
[43:55] God God's perfect sacrifice and the Holy
[43:58] Spirit comes back upon you that brings
[44:01] about an eternal quality to the elect
[44:06] you've got there is an eternal quality
[44:07] and brother Brandon that's actually a
[44:09] quote amen that it brings about an
[44:12] eternal quality that lays within you and
[44:16] so though we don't I don't believe there
[44:19] should be backslidings and going out in
[44:21] sinning but amen and and I I think that
[44:24] once we're set free from alcohol we
[44:26] never have to go back or once we're set
[44:28] free from drugs we never have to go back
[44:32] when we're set free from from from uh um
[44:35] uh uh you know any kind of a sin whether
[44:38] it be uh uh hate or malice or whatever
[44:42] we don't have to go back I believe what
[44:45] God does he does perfect I believe the
[44:48] loosing when God looses you through his
[44:51] blood the prophet said it is a perfect
[44:54] loosing you can stand stand in freedom
[44:57] but you're still living in this flesh
[45:00] amen now you're not under the law of sin
[45:02] and death amen you're under the law of
[45:06] life in Christ Jesus but that does not
[45:08] take away amen sicknesses that the devil
[45:11] tries to throw on you amen a depression
[45:14] that the devil tries and he'll he'll try
[45:16] to bring these things in and and and and
[45:19] even get you busy with family life not
[45:22] necessarily sin per se but to get you
[45:26] out on the way from expectation of
[45:30] walking in that Supernatural realm amen
[45:34] but this is where we've got to
[45:36] understand that when we're walking in
[45:37] this super or when we're walking in this
[45:40] flesh we are not walking in the flesh
[45:42] but we're walking in the spirit the
[45:45] Apostle Paul says now amen we once lived
[45:48] and we once walked after the
[45:52] flesh but we are now walking after the
[45:55] LA law of life that is found in Christ
[45:58] Jesus can you say Amen so as we're
[46:01] walking in the law of life we're living
[46:03] in the law of life we we we greet one
[46:06] another in the flesh we go to work in
[46:10] this flesh we cook supper in this flesh
[46:13] we we raise our children in this flesh
[46:16] but we're living according to the law of
[46:19] life in Christ Jesus and that's where
[46:22] the expectation comes from the
[46:24] expectation does not come from this yes
[46:26] it does not come from your nature it
[46:29] comes from that soul that has received a
[46:32] new birth amen and so amen many of times
[46:37] God brings about and allows situations
[46:40] to come in the natural so that we can
[46:44] see God real in the
[46:48] Supernatural amen one of the one of the
[46:51] greatest things that we could amen uh
[46:53] see and if you wanted to turn there here
[46:55] tonight o over in the book of 2
[46:57] Chronicles and the 20th chapter I've
[47:00] always loved this uh uh passage of of of
[47:03] scripture Austin um was was admiring my
[47:09] uh this these Pages here amen earlier in
[47:12] the office and and talking about all the
[47:14] different colors and everything and and
[47:16] uh amen but a lot of it is is uh I've
[47:20] preached from this subject a lot over
[47:21] the years and so I've highlighted
[47:23] different portions and re highlighted
[47:25] different pors as we're as we're going
[47:27] through it but this is this is quite a
[47:31] uh a testimony of of natural people and
[47:35] how that the supernatural came and was
[47:37] involved I I believe we're serving a
[47:39] supernatural God folks and and this
[47:41] Supernatural God has not wanted just to
[47:44] want want to just be here in church on
[47:45] Sunday morning and Sunday night God
[47:47] wants to live with you and walk with you
[47:49] God's interested in what you're going
[47:51] through and I know I know I I I know
[47:54] that sometimes that amen things are
[47:56] prolonged sicknesses are prolonged uh uh
[47:59] um uh you know pains are prolonged but
[48:01] I'm here to tell you amen after a while
[48:03] that Soul begins to kick in and
[48:05] Desperation begins to kick in and say
[48:07] God I'm going to sit right here until I
[48:10] see the supernatural in my life I I tell
[48:13] you it's one of the greatest things amen
[48:15] it was one of the greatest things it
[48:17] it's it's it's in it it's it's something
[48:19] to say what God done to bring us out of
[48:22] the world but in this journey going over
[48:24] and children of Israel was right there
[48:26] at the Red Sea it was the Red Sea that
[48:28] looked so impossible and looked like
[48:30] there was no hope and no way to come
[48:32] through that God came through and showed
[48:35] himself real can you imagine amen they
[48:37] weren't walking through slime and and
[48:39] and and and and M they they walked
[48:42] across on dry Ground God supernaturally
[48:47] but you see it took a group of people
[48:48] that were sitting there in in in in
[48:51] desperation saying God if you don't come
[48:54] on the scene I'm going to die my
[48:56] children are going to die we're going to
[48:59] we're going to fall amen but God can oh
[49:02] Hallelujah you know what God Said Moses
[49:05] why you crying unto me I've already
[49:07] delivered you why don't you just speak
[49:09] to the people and go across Moses is
[49:12] saying now wait a minute have you have
[49:15] you have you have you seen the Red Sea
[49:17] he says speak and go across and when he
[49:20] spoke the waters parted God performed
[49:23] the supernatural so is God showing
[49:26] himself real amen coming in the natural
[49:30] realm to show us who he is amen now if
[49:34] if you were to Amen to look there in
[49:37] this 2 Chronicles the 20th chapter amen
[49:40] the children of Moab are are are in
[49:44] trouble and the children or the children
[49:46] of Moab and the children of Ammon have
[49:49] have come to war against
[49:51] Jehoshaphat amen and if you were to read
[49:54] and I'd like to just read read just take
[49:56] a little bit of time tonight and read
[49:58] some of this amen and and if you just
[50:00] start at the first verse and it came to
[50:02] pass that the children of Moab and the
[50:04] children of Ammon with them other
[50:06] besides the children of ammonites uh
[50:08] come against the Jehoshaphat to battle
[50:11] And Then There came some that told
[50:13] Jehoshaphat uh saying there cometh a
[50:16] great multitude against thee from Beyond
[50:18] the seed on this side see on this side
[50:20] of Syria and behold they be in uh
[50:24] whatever that word is which is in ingod
[50:27] and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself
[50:31] to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast
[50:35] throughout all Judah and Judah gathered
[50:38] themselves together to ask help of the
[50:41] Lord even out of all the cities of Judah
[50:44] they come to seek the Lord amen so so
[50:48] desperation begins to create a hunger
[50:53] how many knows that when you're when
[50:55] when the desperation begins to come or
[50:58] when things The Impossible begins to
[51:00] come amen that that that that's when you
[51:03] really begin to call on the Lord you
[51:06] call on the Lord when things are a
[51:08] little amen when when there are are
[51:11] situations that you just can't get
[51:12] around amen but you see when they didn't
[51:16] know what to do Jehoshaphat being a
[51:19] Godly King he got all of Judah together
[51:22] and he says we are going together in
[51:24] prayer and we're going to call unto the
[51:27] Lord amen and the scripture says that he
[51:31] set himself third verse when he feared
[51:36] he set himself to seek the Lord and
[51:40] proclaimed a fast throughout all of
[51:43] Judah and then Judah gathered together
[51:46] now the fifth verse it says Jehoshaphat
[51:48] stood in the congregation of Judah and
[51:51] Jerusalem in the house of the Lord
[51:54] before the new court now I want you to
[51:56] understand this I want you to I want you
[51:58] to just see the heart of Jehoshaphat
[52:00] because whatever he done he got God's
[52:02] attention and and he and he says that
[52:05] amen the sixth verse and and said oh
[52:08] Lord God of our fathers art thou God are
[52:12] not thou God in heaven and rulest not
[52:15] thou over all the kingdoms of of the
[52:17] heaven of the Heathen and in thine hand
[52:20] is there not power and might so that
[52:23] none is able to withstand thee art thou
[52:26] AR not thou God who did drive out the
[52:30] inhabitants of this land before thy
[52:32] People Israel and gavest it to the Seed
[52:35] of Abraham thy friend forever and they
[52:38] dwelt therein and have built thee a
[52:41] sanctuary therein for thy name saying
[52:43] now there's a godly man that is calling
[52:45] on the name of the Lord if when evil
[52:48] cometh upon us as the sword judgment or
[52:53] pestilence or famine we stand before
[52:55] this house and in thy presence for thy
[52:58] name is in this house and cry in our
[53:02] Affliction when thou wil hear and help
[53:05] and when and now that behold the
[53:07] children of the Ammon and Moab and mount
[53:10] seir whom thou uh wouldest not let
[53:13] Israel invade when they came out of the
[53:16] land of Egypt they turned uh but they
[53:18] turned from them and destroyed them not
[53:21] behold I say how they reward us to come
[53:25] to cast us out of thy possession which
[53:28] thou Hast given to us uh given us to
[53:31] inherit now what is he doing he is
[53:34] remind when he's praying he's not
[53:37] praying his problem he is praying God's
[53:41] word he is reminding God you gave the
[53:46] promise he's living in the natural but
[53:51] he's reminding god of the Supernatural
[53:54] That's Right he is saying you're the one
[53:57] that gave the promise now I I I want you
[54:00] to really look at that because some of
[54:01] you may be looking at an enemy that is
[54:03] trying to kill you amen maybe physically
[54:06] maybe spiritually amen maybe maybe
[54:08] trying to take one of your children and
[54:10] and you're not going to be able to to
[54:12] win in the natural amen he didn't call
[54:14] all the guys together with the swords
[54:16] and the Spears and he didn't call all
[54:17] the Army together he called the church
[54:20] together and called them into prayer
[54:24] desperation
[54:25] caused them to reach out to the one who
[54:29] had called them at the
[54:31] beginning oh glory be to the Lamb of God
[54:34] I believe God is honored amen when we we
[54:37] when we come to him we knew one thing
[54:40] Judah knew one thing that they were of
[54:44] the Seed of Abraham thy seed shall
[54:48] possess the gates of their enemies and
[54:52] stood in Solomon's Temple he stood right
[54:55] right there and he said you promised
[54:58] that you would hear our prayers you
[55:02] promised when Solomon built this that if
[55:04] we should call upon your name you would
[55:07] hear Oh Glory to God you see God cannot
[55:11] lie so if you put your trust in God's
[55:13] word that's an anchor that's an anchor
[55:17] in your storm God can not lie that's
[55:22] right God can roll back the Seas God can
[55:24] create amen the Stars God can create
[55:27] Heavens God created the Earth God can do
[55:30] anything but God can not lie it that's
[55:35] one thing that God can't do he can't
[55:36] tell a lie he can't tell a lie amen so
[55:40] when God says something when you're in
[55:43] your storm when you're going in your and
[55:46] you're in the Whirlwind and and maybe
[55:48] the tornadoes coming near you God's word
[55:51] should be your anchor it should be your
[55:55] tornado shelter it should be your bomb
[55:59] shelter because God's word can not
[56:05] fail a natural people expecting the
[56:10] supernatural God that's right now now
[56:13] it's not just the figment of your
[56:14] imagination you can't go up to God and
[56:17] say all right I'm expecting Supernatural
[56:21] help amen Trump can't go up to God and
[56:24] expect super Supernatural help amen
[56:26] Biden can't go up to God unless he's
[56:30] unless they're the elect is that right
[56:32] but when God calls you and God ordained
[56:35] you just like Israel you gave us this
[56:38] land you sent us here you said you would
[56:41] fight our battle you said that when the
[56:44] enemy comes in and if we would come to
[56:47] this Temple you would hear from
[56:51] Heaven that that that word was all all
[56:55] they needed to hear amen that word was
[56:58] all they oh Church of God if you could
[57:01] put your confidence in the word of God
[57:04] Allelujah that's the reason I say I
[57:06] don't care about the big name preacher
[57:08] here and I don't really care about all
[57:10] the opinions in the message amen God
[57:13] gave us a clearcut message he gave it to
[57:16] us through that seventh angel and it
[57:19] doesn't matter what anyone else says it
[57:22] really doesn't matter what you say it
[57:24] don't matter what I say it don't matter
[57:25] what amen what a a preacher says there
[57:28] is one absolute and that's God's word
[57:31] and that's what that Prophet brought us
[57:33] back too is the absolute of God's
[57:36] brother I'm here to tell you heavens and
[57:38] earth are going to pass away but you can
[57:40] depend on the word the enemy is going to
[57:43] come it's going to go it's going to come
[57:44] one way and it's going to flee seven
[57:46] ways because God's word is our
[57:53] absolute
[57:55] we're depending on that can you say Amen
[57:58] now God loves to test his people amen
[58:02] lots of times you're in trouble amen M
[58:05] it's not because you backslid many times
[58:07] you get in trouble because God's testing
[58:09] you and God's wanting to show you amen
[58:13] the strength of that Supernatural seed
[58:15] on the inside of you amen he wants to he
[58:18] already knows what he's got on the
[58:20] inside of you he wants you to know what
[58:21] you got on the inside of you he already
[58:24] knows what he's put him there amen well
[58:26] he knew Abraham he knew Abraham was
[58:28] going to make it but he tested Abraham's
[58:32] Faith well I want to say tonight I'm so
[58:35] glad that God has confidence in his
[58:37] people to test his people I'm glad that
[58:40] amen that he was proud of joob I'm I I'm
[58:43] glad to read that in the Bible where the
[58:44] Bible says amen where where God told
[58:47] Satan he says have you tried my servant
[58:49] joob he's perfect and just and amen
[58:52] there is none like him in all of the
[58:54] Earth and amen these you I'm going to
[58:56] tell you he ain't going to fail Satan
[58:58] says oh yes he will I'm glad to hear God
[59:01] brag on me and I say when you're in the
[59:03] trial and Satan's coming against you why
[59:06] don't you just lift up your head lift up
[59:09] your hands and say God is bragging on me
[59:12] God's bringing me to this point to show
[59:14] his work in me I am
[59:17] expecting the supernatural God in my
[59:21] life amen I'm in this trial because God
[59:25] ordained it amen God's sending me
[59:28] through it God's allowing it and I am
[59:30] expecting God to move in a supernatural
[59:33] way that's right
[59:37] amen can you say Amen now whether it's
[59:41] the fiery furnace or the Lion's Den or
[59:44] the am man or the Red Sea or whatever
[59:48] you want to look at here tonight amen no
[59:50] matter what you want to look at the
[59:52] Supernatural is always
[59:55] there God puts you in a natural
[1:00:00] situation to reveal the
[1:00:03] supernatural in your presence amen what
[1:00:07] it is is amen though I walk through the
[1:00:10] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:00:13] fear no evil for
[1:00:16] thou somebody say
[1:00:18] thou art with me right thou preparest a
[1:00:23] table before me in the presence of mine
[1:00:26] enemies thou you see what it does is it
[1:00:30] separates the men from the boys it
[1:00:33] separates amen the wannabes from the
[1:00:37] real the church member from the true me
[1:00:41] uh true uh uh elect can you say Amen so
[1:00:44] God loves to test now as we have read
[1:00:48] here amen
[1:00:50] Jehoshaphat he was afraid but he feared
[1:00:54] but he set himself to seek the Lord now
[1:00:58] I I think about Jeremiah the 31st
[1:01:00] chapter in the 9th verse and it says and
[1:01:03] they shall come with
[1:01:06] weeping and with
[1:01:08] supplications will I lead
[1:01:10] them and and I I I think that sometimes
[1:01:14] we we we we think that that's means it's
[1:01:17] going to be just a lot of Sorrow I don't
[1:01:19] really look at it in that way I I I
[1:01:22] there's going to be sorrow involved
[1:01:25] man but there's going there there
[1:01:26] there's going to be the situations that
[1:01:28] you're going to be in in your lifetime
[1:01:30] that you're going to need God and the
[1:01:32] way that you fight is going to be on
[1:01:34] your
[1:01:34] knees the way you fight is going to be a
[1:01:38] desperate prayer before God we we we
[1:01:42] we've got too much where it's just a
[1:01:44] little lay me down to bed uh prayer it's
[1:01:47] it's just a little it's just a the
[1:01:49] prayer meetings aren't really prayer
[1:01:50] meetings anymore it's just saying a few
[1:01:52] a few dry words but God wants us to come
[1:01:55] into the supernatural realm and the
[1:01:57] supernatural realm is going to require
[1:01:59] amen it's going to require a battle and
[1:02:02] the way you fight the way you fight is
[1:02:05] by
[1:02:06] desperation and I'm sorry but there's
[1:02:09] very very few times where tears are not
[1:02:12] part of desperation there's very few
[1:02:15] times that you're calling Amen to God
[1:02:19] and just with a dry eye with respiration
[1:02:21] but there's something that is wrenching
[1:02:23] your gut whether it's over child or amen
[1:02:25] a a wayward loved one or a job or or
[1:02:29] whatever and and and and and and it just
[1:02:31] seems like you're being squeezed it
[1:02:33] seems like the enemy is is is really
[1:02:36] hitting you hard and the sad thing is
[1:02:39] amen many of times according to what God
[1:02:42] uh told as David said he says my very
[1:02:45] own friends have persecuted me my very
[1:02:48] own amen those that are the closest to
[1:02:51] me when Jesus was standing there he says
[1:02:54] in the the house of my friends did I
[1:02:57] receive these
[1:02:59] scars uh uh receive these wounds you see
[1:03:03] God allowed those things to take place
[1:03:06] it was it was uh it was it was Joseph's
[1:03:09] very own Kindred amen that were jealous
[1:03:12] of him and persecuted him and sold him
[1:03:17] but you see every one of these things
[1:03:20] amen it was for the
[1:03:23] supernatural to to be
[1:03:27] expressed be expressed in and through
[1:03:31] them oh can you say Amen you see it
[1:03:34] takes those things it takes the agony it
[1:03:37] takes those things to to come and amen
[1:03:41] and and and and and it and and it and it
[1:03:43] hurts and it causes the friction on the
[1:03:47] inside it causes the headaches it causes
[1:03:50] the sleepless nights it causes those
[1:03:53] things but I want you to know when
[1:03:55] you're looking unto him the one who gave
[1:03:58] the promise and you place your heart
[1:04:01] upon him the one who said I'll never
[1:04:04] leave you nor forsake you I'll love you
[1:04:07] with an everlasting love then you can
[1:04:09] know amen that the great Shepherd is
[1:04:12] with me while in the valley and I will
[1:04:16] come forth you can put your confidence
[1:04:20] in that
[1:04:23] word you got to get desperate and
[1:04:26] sometimes
[1:04:27] desperation
[1:04:29] comes sometimes am man as as we were to
[1:04:34] finish reading they shall come with
[1:04:36] weeping and supplication will I lead
[1:04:38] them and I will cause them to walk by
[1:04:42] the rivers of water in a straight way
[1:04:43] and wherein they shall not stumble but
[1:04:47] it
[1:04:47] requires it
[1:04:50] requires the
[1:04:52] uncomfortable situation
[1:04:55] that God puts us in in as as his sons
[1:04:59] and his daughters are you understanding
[1:05:00] what I'm saying he puts us in these
[1:05:05] situations because He is wanting to show
[1:05:08] himself strong and I I I want to tell
[1:05:11] you amen Joseph Joseph is a man that has
[1:05:16] been proven by God that God was with
[1:05:21] him Joseph was one Moses was one these
[1:05:25] Great Men the three Hebrew children all
[1:05:28] down through
[1:05:30] scripture it took these pressure to
[1:05:34] bring about that
[1:05:37] desperation and that desperation created
[1:05:40] weeping and
[1:05:41] supplications and that caused them to
[1:05:44] walk by the rivers of water in a
[1:05:47] straight way wherein they would not
[1:05:49] stumble supplication in the English it
[1:05:51] means a humble sincere appeal it means
[1:05:54] an urgent request to somebody who has
[1:05:58] the power to Grant a request now I I
[1:06:02] want you to think about that because
[1:06:03] amen it's an urgent request to somebody
[1:06:07] Allelujah we know that there ain't
[1:06:08] nobody you can't pick yourself up by
[1:06:10] your bootstraps and there's no one here
[1:06:11] on the earth that can pick you up so
[1:06:14] you're looking unto
[1:06:16] God who has all power Amen to Grant your
[1:06:21] request in the Hebrew it means to seek
[1:06:23] favor
[1:06:24] to implore to beg plead for favor
[1:06:28] brother Bram would say when you get
[1:06:30] desperate about this
[1:06:33] thing times something will or get
[1:06:37] desperate about this saying something
[1:06:38] will take place you're not desperate
[1:06:40] enough oh well I join the church and
[1:06:43] that settles
[1:06:45] it but you be desperate about
[1:06:49] it you have to really need God Jesus
[1:06:53] said blessed are they that that do
[1:06:54] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:06:56] for they shall be filled but as long as
[1:06:59] you're
[1:07:00] satisfied hear me now as long as you're
[1:07:04] satisfied with the things of this world
[1:07:07] how can God ever speak to you you say
[1:07:09] God's never spoke to me why he wants to
[1:07:14] but you're too filled up with the things
[1:07:16] of the
[1:07:17] world see so that's why God puts us in
[1:07:22] those situations s that are
[1:07:26] uncomfortable that's why God allows
[1:07:30] things to happen sometimes in family
[1:07:32] sometimes in job sometimes in school
[1:07:34] sometimes amen uh between husband and
[1:07:38] wife God allows things that if we will
[1:07:43] reach out after him it will bring him
[1:07:48] into this
[1:07:49] realm Hallelujah when you're getting
[1:07:52] sick and amen the enemy is coming in and
[1:07:56] he's and he's and he's trying to get you
[1:07:57] to you know uh uh uh stay home from
[1:08:00] church or trying to get you to worry
[1:08:02] about amen this or that and you can just
[1:08:05] stand right there and say you know what
[1:08:07] I've got something greater than this
[1:08:09] situation God has allowed this situation
[1:08:13] I'm I'm here to tell you I I know the
[1:08:16] flu might run around I know that amen Co
[1:08:19] ran its course I I know that there's a
[1:08:21] lot but I'm here to tell you I I I ain't
[1:08:24] going to get it unless God knows that
[1:08:26] I'm going to get it
[1:08:27] first and if God allows me to go through
[1:08:32] that Valley then God's given me the
[1:08:34] assurance that I'm coming out of the
[1:08:36] valley if God has allowed me to go
[1:08:40] through sickness go through cancer go
[1:08:43] through whatever you want to fill in
[1:08:46] then I've got a promise that he is my
[1:08:51] healer he is my deliverer
[1:08:58] can you say Amen so what he does he
[1:09:02] brings things our way so that we can get
[1:09:06] rid of a lot of junk in our lives true
[1:09:12] Hallelujah junk God don't want you
[1:09:15] putting the junk in storage God want you
[1:09:17] to get rid of the
[1:09:19] junk amen don't don't don't he's Wan you
[1:09:23] to get rid of the clutter in your life
[1:09:26] not not at another storage building
[1:09:28] Hallelujah he wants us he wants us to to
[1:09:31] come to where it is nothing but him that
[1:09:36] we
[1:09:38] desire now it was it took Moses that was
[1:09:41] 40 years in that
[1:09:43] Wilderness it took that as I said
[1:09:45] earlier this morning Moses had got to
[1:09:48] the point he didn't think it was
[1:09:50] possible Moses didn't gave up on the
[1:09:52] idea Moses wasn't going want to have it
[1:09:54] he just brother brandom says he totally
[1:09:56] forgot about it he just Hallelujah and
[1:10:01] that was about the time that God shows
[1:10:03] up and says all right now I can do
[1:10:05] something with you right because now and
[1:10:08] then he's over there saying I stutter
[1:10:10] too much I can't
[1:10:11] I oh glory to God what was it it was God
[1:10:15] getting him to a point to where he would
[1:10:18] rely wholly and totally upon that
[1:10:21] Supernatural Rim can you amen amen now
[1:10:26] now he says he says uh uh he we uh we
[1:10:29] find out that Isaiah Isaiah got
[1:10:32] desperate and he screamed out and
[1:10:33] confessed his sins confessed the sins of
[1:10:35] his people and when he got through
[1:10:36] confessing he heard a noise up above
[1:10:40] him and he looked up and there was a
[1:10:42] chair there were cherums flying back and
[1:10:44] forth through the building Wings over
[1:10:46] their faces Wings over their feet flying
[1:10:49] with wings crying holy holy holy Lord
[1:10:51] God Almighty something was taking place
[1:10:54] Isaiah got
[1:10:56] desperate God come on the job can you
[1:10:59] say am man so so God when he got
[1:11:04] desperate
[1:11:06] God come on the job I like I just love
[1:11:09] the way that our Prophet
[1:11:10] talks he says now when he came and he
[1:11:13] seen and he confessed and then he saw
[1:11:16] the
[1:11:16] Supernatural and then he knew that
[1:11:19] God come on the
[1:11:21] job he was ready to do do something can
[1:11:24] you say man it reminded me as I as I
[1:11:27] read that it it reminded me of of this
[1:11:29] quote too I I've Loved this quote over
[1:11:32] the years he said Paul Paul said none of
[1:11:35] these things bother me for he was tied
[1:11:37] to an absolute Christ every true
[1:11:40] achievement is tied to an absolute and
[1:11:42] my absolute is the word and everybody
[1:11:44] else that's really born of the spirit of
[1:11:46] God their absolute is God's
[1:11:51] word I'm tied to it I laid my hands upon
[1:11:55] it it took my place I've identified
[1:11:59] myself with him we we knew that he
[1:12:02] promised to identify himself with us and
[1:12:05] that brings that genuine faith not your
[1:12:07] own faith but his faith something that
[1:12:10] you don't control he does it can you say
[1:12:14] amen he says then and only then is the
[1:12:17] promise made to you now I want us to as
[1:12:22] we look at at this
[1:12:25] chapter now we can see amen that they
[1:12:29] have no power now that 12th verse he
[1:12:32] says oh
[1:12:33] God man he he he says Thou will thou not
[1:12:37] judge them for we have no might against
[1:12:41] this great company that cometh against
[1:12:43] us neither know we what to do but our
[1:12:47] eyes are upon
[1:12:48] thee and all of
[1:12:51] Judah stood before the Lord with their
[1:12:54] little ones with their wives with their
[1:12:57] children isn't that just
[1:13:00] beautiful Hallelujah when desperation
[1:13:03] comes bring the whole family bring it
[1:13:05] all bring them all in and say guys I
[1:13:07] want y'all to see what God is fixing to
[1:13:09] do God's fixing to do a
[1:13:11] miracle then if you would read from down
[1:13:14] from the 14th chapter man and and down
[1:13:18] to the 17th chapter then God comes upon
[1:13:21] a prophet a haziel or je uh
[1:13:25] jezel amen and and and it in the 15th
[1:13:29] verse he he says hearken ye all
[1:13:33] Judah and ye inhabitants of
[1:13:36] Jerusalem Thou King of
[1:13:39] Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord oh
[1:13:43] Hallelujah Be not Afraid nor dismayed by
[1:13:46] reason of this great multitude for the
[1:13:49] battle is not yours but
[1:13:51] God's tomorrow go ye down against them
[1:13:56] behold they come up by the cliff z z and
[1:14:00] ye shall find them at the end of the
[1:14:02] brook before the Wilderness of
[1:14:05] jeruel now I I I I just I just want to
[1:14:08] stop here for a moment and say you know
[1:14:11] there's a lot of lot of talk in the land
[1:14:13] right now about
[1:14:15] gifts and uh some's asked
[1:14:19] me what side do you follow I believe in
[1:14:22] the all nine spirits
[1:14:23] gifts I believe every Son of God will
[1:14:26] believe in all nine spiritual
[1:14:28] gifts I believe that if God's got a gift
[1:14:33] Among Us and there's Visions or
[1:14:36] interpretations prophecies tongues and
[1:14:40] interpretations I believe they're going
[1:14:41] to be accurate I believe the
[1:14:44] supernatural wants to speak to and
[1:14:46] through the people I believe that if God
[1:14:50] can do this take a just a just a minor
[1:14:52] prophet here under under the Bulls of
[1:14:55] goat bulls and goats and can come and
[1:14:57] tell them exactly where the enemy is
[1:14:59] going to be and how to defeat it God's
[1:15:00] big enough to do that again
[1:15:07] today but I don't believe in I I I don't
[1:15:11] believe in this vague prophecy
[1:15:16] thing this
[1:15:18] vague where where it could come to pass
[1:15:21] or well it will come to pass because
[1:15:23] there's really not a way for it not to
[1:15:24] come to
[1:15:25] pass I've got a problem with it yes sir
[1:15:29] I've seen a lot of
[1:15:30] that in the in the nonsense I came out
[1:15:34] of God's got a bride the prophet said
[1:15:37] there's going to be the nine spiritual
[1:15:38] gifts in this bride I believe it's going
[1:15:41] to be here I believe that it is
[1:15:45] here but there's going to be sons and
[1:15:47] daughters that know how to use it we're
[1:15:48] not just going to be blabbing come
[1:15:51] on and we're not going to be giving
[1:15:53] vague predictions if God wants to tell
[1:15:55] us hey go down to clicks tomorrow
[1:15:57] morning at at 10:00 because there's a
[1:16:00] guy down there that's going to need
[1:16:01] salvation and the Holy Spirit has said
[1:16:03] that and and the Lord is and and and
[1:16:05] he's moved upon me to tell Kobe that
[1:16:08] he's going to lead somebody to the Lord
[1:16:10] then Kobe can go down there at clicks
[1:16:12] tomorrow morning at 10:00 amen and and
[1:16:15] and find the man there lead the man to
[1:16:18] the Lord because God is
[1:16:22] spoken amen we don't need no guessing
[1:16:25] and God don't need you
[1:16:27] guessing God's big enough to
[1:16:31] talk and if he wants to talk he can be
[1:16:34] precise
[1:16:37] that's can you say Amen so true I think
[1:16:41] we need to I think we need to not just
[1:16:44] takeen every little thing that comes
[1:16:47] through and and and you know there and
[1:16:49] and and and listen I just want to make
[1:16:50] my stand for right here where I stand
[1:16:52] and let let you all know where I stand I
[1:16:55] am not against the tongues and I'm not
[1:16:57] against the prophecy and I'm not against
[1:16:59] visions and dreams but I don't want to
[1:17:01] ever go back to Pentecost the the
[1:17:03] denominational Pentecost I came out
[1:17:07] of God wants to speak he can speak and I
[1:17:11] and and and brother brandham says and
[1:17:12] when he speaks and when those when those
[1:17:15] gifts are in the church it will bring
[1:17:17] fear among the whole
[1:17:21] congregation well glory to God
[1:17:24] so God is a why not expect you say well
[1:17:29] well no one can be that accurate well
[1:17:35] then shut up and quit
[1:17:40] prophesying but if you know that it has
[1:17:43] been a promise that has been given in
[1:17:46] this day how many believes that it is a
[1:17:50] promise then I can expect
[1:17:53] the supernatural gifts running through
[1:17:56] our little church right
[1:17:58] here I believe we can expect God to
[1:18:01] speak in tongues I believe we can expect
[1:18:04] God to to uh to to uh have prophecy the
[1:18:07] Apostle Paul I mean he dedicated three
[1:18:10] chapters to it there in the book of
[1:18:13] Corinthians he believed in it brother
[1:18:16] Bradon believed in
[1:18:20] it but we want the original I want my
[1:18:24] expectation of the super I don't want
[1:18:27] Hallelujah God's still using humans
[1:18:30] God's still speaking through humans but
[1:18:32] it's still the supernatural voice of
[1:18:35] God well can you say Amen you see
[1:18:39] desperation I believe there should be a
[1:18:42] desperation to see
[1:18:44] those
[1:18:46] gifts to see those gifts in operation in
[1:18:51] the church
[1:18:53] that's right there should be those
[1:18:55] desperation for God to
[1:18:57] move but I'm not seeking
[1:19:00] gifts I'm not following hallelujah amen
[1:19:04] I I I've seen too many of gifted men
[1:19:07] that really you and they were gifted

[1:19:51] pestal that's
[1:19:54] right that's right you watch those men

[1:19:58] them because they're gifted and can see
[1:20:00] in their lives that's a
[1:20:03] shame

[1:21:37] over us constantly having a vision about
[1:21:40] us constantly saying a word over us and
[1:21:44] it got to the point where we didn't even

[1:22:53] following and seeking the gifts they
[1:22:55] were seeking God who gave the promise

[1:25:19] boy and told him and they got up and and
[1:25:23] and and
[1:25:24] prophesied that that persecution is
[1:25:27] coming and to leave uh whatever land

[1:25:32] the United States or or to head they
[1:25:34] didn't even he didn't know what the
[1:25:35] United States was y y' y y y'all were

[1:26:01] upon him again and says it's coming

[1:26:06] and we find out uh that that the family
[1:26:10] that that was the the the grandfather of
[1:26:13] brother shakaryan would have been
[1:26:15] slaughtered if he would have stayed
[1:26:17] there so God hallelujah knew that
[1:26:22] brother shakarian was going to have to
[1:26:24] send brother brandom around the world

[1:31:20] given
[1:31:23] and then from
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:26] 18
[1:31:30] unto
[1:31:32] um I I would say 18 on down to the 24th
[1:31:35] chap
[1:31:37] verse now now we're finding
[1:31:40] worship now we we see this worship and I
[1:31:42] would say it's it's from 18 well let's
[1:31:44] just read it Jehoshaphat bowed his
[1:31:47] head with his face to the ground and all
[1:31:49] Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:31:51] fell before the the Lord worshiping the
[1:31:53] Lord and the Levites of the children of
[1:31:56] the coites of the children of the kites
[1:32:00] stood up to praise the Lord God of
[1:32:03] Israel with a loud voice on high now I
[1:32:06] want you to I want once again when you
[1:32:10] know that it's accurate brother brandham
[1:32:11] brother brandham had even said this and
[1:32:13] this is this is something that I and and
[1:32:17] and I I I want that Supernatural
[1:32:20] presence of God and I and I want I I I I
[1:32:23] I want us to to to have where God is
[1:32:27] genuinely speaking because then we can
[1:32:29] have a a confidence but brother brandom
[1:32:32] uh before I go any further brother
[1:32:35] brandom you remember the girl that had
[1:32:37] the dream and and she would come back to
[1:32:40] brother brandom and ask I I I'm waiting
[1:32:42] for my
[1:32:43] interpretation you remember that and and
[1:32:46] she would come and and and brother
[1:32:48] brandom says come here
[1:32:50] honey he says says you don't want
[1:32:53] brother brandom just giving you an in an
[1:32:57] interpretation he said I think I might
[1:32:59] know what that means but you don't want
[1:33:02] me because when it comes down to when
[1:33:06] you need to hear from the
[1:33:10] Lord you're going to want to
[1:33:13] know that what I say is coming from the
[1:33:17] Lord he said so if I told you
[1:33:20] something
[1:33:22] and and it's not from the Lord It's Me
[1:33:26] guessing but if the Lord tells me I
[1:33:30] promise you I'll give you the
[1:33:32] interpretation of that dream Now isn't
[1:33:34] that just wonderful you see because he
[1:33:37] says you're going to
[1:33:40] need to have
[1:33:42] confidence in
[1:33:45] me now as we read this here and again I
[1:33:48] just love this chapter as as it's all
[1:33:50] marked up amen
[1:33:55] Jehoshaphat 18th verse bows his head all
[1:33:58] of the Juda and they're worshiping the
[1:34:01] Lord the Levites 19th verse stood up to
[1:34:04] praise the Lord and Israel with a loud
[1:34:06] voice 20th verse they rose up early in
[1:34:10] the morning they went into the wilder
[1:34:12] wilderness of
[1:34:14] tocoa as they went forth Jehoshaphat
[1:34:17] stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye
[1:34:20] inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:34:22] believe in the Lord your God and so
[1:34:24] shall you be established believed in his
[1:34:26] Prophet so shall you
[1:34:28] prosper when he had consulted with the
[1:34:30] people he appointed singers unto the
[1:34:32] Lord that they should praise the beauty
[1:34:34] of Holiness as they went out before the
[1:34:36] Army to say praise the Lord for his
[1:34:40] mercy endureth forever and when they
[1:34:43] begin to sing and to
[1:34:47] praise the Lord set ambushments against
[1:34:50] the children of Ammon Moab and mount
[1:34:53] seir and they come against which were
[1:34:56] come against Judah and they were smitten
[1:34:59] the children of Ammon and Moab stood up
[1:35:02] stood against the inhabitants of Mount
[1:35:04] seir and utterly D slay and Destroy them
[1:35:07] and when they had made an end of the
[1:35:09] inhabitants of seir everyone helped to
[1:35:11] destroy another and when Judah come
[1:35:14] toward to watch to to the Watchtower in
[1:35:17] the wilderness they looked unto the
[1:35:19] multitude and beheld
[1:35:21] they were dead bodies Fallen to the
[1:35:24] Earth and none escaped and when
[1:35:26] Jehoshaphat and his people came to take
[1:35:29] away the spoil they found among them in
[1:35:32] abundance both riches with the dead
[1:35:35] bodies and precious jewels which were
[1:35:37] stripped off of them for themselves more
[1:35:40] than they could carry away and they were
[1:35:42] three days in gathering of the spoil it
[1:35:44] was so much can I hear a great big amen
[1:35:49] amen do you love him
[1:35:51] amen can we expect it yes I think we can
[1:35:56] expect
[1:35:57] it if you go on down there to the 27th
[1:36:00] verse and they returned every man of
[1:36:01] Judah and Jerusalem the musicians can
[1:36:04] come Jehoshaphat in the Forefront of
[1:36:06] them to go again to Jerusalem with joy
[1:36:09] for the Lord had made them to Rejoice
[1:36:11] over their
[1:36:12] enemies and they came to Jerusalem with
[1:36:15] suies and harps and trumpets unto the
[1:36:17] house of the Lord and the fear of the
[1:36:19] Lord fear of God was on all the kingdoms
[1:36:22] of those countries when they had heard
[1:36:25] that the Lord had fought against the
[1:36:26] enemies of
[1:36:29] Israel

[1:37:59] praise now the word is our
[1:38:02] absolute we don't
[1:38:05] follow dreams and prophecies that's not
[1:38:08] what this message is
[1:38:10] about we're not following signs and
[1:38:13] wonders but because we're Believers in
[1:38:17] that
[1:38:20] word
[1:38:21] because they weren't seeking for signs
[1:38:24] and wonders they weren't looking for
[1:38:25] they weren't looking for someone to come
[1:38:27] in and discern for them and tell them
[1:38:28] what to do they had the word they were
[1:38:31] calling unto God they knew that God they
[1:38:34] were reminding God of that word you
[1:38:36] promised and we're
[1:38:38] here can you say
[1:38:42] Amen that word is what anchors our
[1:38:46] heart not a
[1:38:48] prophecy not
[1:38:50] tongues that word anchors our
[1:38:54] heart all of the other we're sure
[1:38:56] thankful
[1:38:58] for but her anchor is in the
[1:39:01] veil and I love the times when God comes
[1:39:04] back in a supernatural way Supernatural
[1:39:06] vent sometimes a wind of God will just
[1:39:08] blow through and you can feel the wind
[1:39:10] as it's coming through you've ever been

[1:52:01] all so there have been some that have
[1:52:05] asked uh brother Kobe
[1:52:08] about you know starting tomorrow night
[1:52:12] even you know maybe taking stuff down
[1:52:14] there start start doing
[1:52:16] that
[1:52:18] um and and I I think Caleb is wanting uh
[1:52:24] to start
[1:52:26] taking I think brother Michael and I we
[1:52:29] both got uh we've both got trailers if
[1:52:32] there's anyone else that has a trailer
[1:52:34] we could use that to as yours
[1:52:36] empty okay brother Michaels he's got one
[1:52:39] empty I think I I don't think we'll need
[1:52:41] no more than three trailers don't you
[1:52:44] think
[1:52:45] um and then
[1:52:48] um
[1:52:51] if
[1:52:55] um so we were going to put lights up
[1:52:58] tomorrow night but I but we're missing
[1:52:59] the
[1:53:01] bullhorns and so um so we still that's
[1:53:05] going to be on pause if I mean notless
[1:53:07] we want to go ahead and run run some
[1:53:09] electric to it just in case it comes in
[1:53:12] I mean we could we could do that um I
[1:53:16] would I would say that since they're
[1:53:18] being so kind to us to let us start
[1:53:20] early these days um it would save a
[1:53:25] whole lot of work on Wednesday and
[1:53:27] Thursday if if we did but I don't I
[1:53:29] don't want us laboring late at night all
[1:53:31] throughout the week and then so if we
[1:53:33] think that we can sort of help out and
[1:53:36] where we're not going to where we can
[1:53:38] rest up a little bit more towards
[1:53:40] Wednesday night that would probably be a
[1:53:42] blessing if if we could do that so um I
[1:53:47] I don't know how uh
[1:53:51] um uh that you know Caleb takes care of
[1:53:55] the Cs and and the numbering on the
[1:53:57] chairs and all of that kind of thing and
[1:53:59] so but if you're going to do that
[1:54:01] tomorrow night what time were you
[1:54:02] wanting to start
[1:54:04] that 5 okay so if we done something like
[1:54:11] it

[1:54:15] if I I would say now I
[1:54:26] yeah I I I would say let's load them up
