and uh amen well I'm just glad to be a Christian and I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord we're going to read one verse of Revelations 3 and 8 it says I Know Thy works and behold I

love you and forgive us of our wrongs and our sins and Lord help us help us Lord to hit the mark and we just thank you for these things in Jesus name and the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight now we're going to be reading um and uh here in the book of in the see the church age book at 298 and can everyone hear me okay here tonight um page 298 in the blue book and um uh I don't let's see it's we're going to be beginning here at the age of the open door in the Philadelphia and age I don't know what that would be in the red um and if someone has it in the red and you want to uh give the page number to that that'd be awesome to praise the Lord okay um let's let's see here so um we have just read that um Revelations 38 so we're going to skip on down to the second paragraph it says uh the first phrase of this verse I Know Thy works is analyzed in the rest of the verse for The Works had to do with the Open Door little strength the word and the name in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in behold I have set before you an open door and no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age there is an overlapping a melting or fading in two rather than an Abrupt end or a clear cut start this age particularly flows in to the next age now if y'all remember in the church age as we've been going through every age they did not have a it did not just start and stop so amen uh so we went from Ephesians age and then there was an overlapping from Ephesians into the uh into the smea so as it's ending the other one there there's an overlapping as one's coming out or ending the other one is beginning and so um so that's what he's that's what he's saying even though we have the the dates here 53 to 170 170 to 312 each one of these ages uh they they overlap and so um and so he is talking about this this age here amen uh with the Philadelphian age and the leoan age it's going to be very very much so that way because the spirit of the Lord is already dealing uh in in sanctification and the power of God was was was beginning to move and he actually said that even even uh 1906 was a was a continuation of that sixth age as it's as it's entering in so always keep that in mind and so he's going back he's going back to that um it says not only does this age overflow into the last age the last age is in many respects simply carrying on of the sixth age the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has about run its course the leoan age quickly comes in bringing both the terrs and the Wheats and the wheat to harvest first bind the terrs to burn them them but gather the wheat into my barn Matthew 13:30 remember please this that the sardian age started the Reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing Etc until it comes right back to the original seed while this is going on the tears that were swn will have to go through their cycle and be harvested also that is exactly what we see happening if you can just think of the seasons you can get a very good picture of this the plant you see growing in full strength in the summer suddenly appears to be going to seed you can't tell exactly when summer became Autumn it just faded into it that is how the ages are especially these last two it is the age that Jesus says I come quickly that makes the last age a very short one Le oosa is the age of the quick work it is cut short now we will specifically dwell on the open door that no man can shut first of all I want to dwell on the open door as signifying the tremendous missionary effort of that age Paul called a new missionary endeavor um for the Lord an Open Door 2 Corinthians 2:12 furthermore when I come to tro to preach the Christ's gospel a door was open unto me of the Lord so we can see by the comparison of the scriptures that this Open Door signified the greatest spreading of the Gospel that the world has yet has ever seen I want you to see something here God Works in threes doesn't he he was in the third or the pergamin age that um that the church was married to the state let me say it again it was in the third or pamenan age that the church was married to the state the Deeds of the nicians had become the doctrine of the nicians that age was the open door for the false Vine and once it was backed up by the power of the state it become actually a world system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now Three Ages later after a long and hard struggle of Faith here comes the open door to the truth the word of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age had uh set the stage for this Mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books Etc it would have been one wonderful if this Open Door had followed the Divine pattern of Pentecost which was set forth in Hebrews 121:4 therefore we ought to give the most Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will now you know that this is the pattern for Jesus himself said so Mark 16:1 15-20 he said unto them go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up in into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following amen he never told them to go into all the world and establish Bible colleges nor did he tell them to pass out literature now those things are fine but what Jesus told them to do was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs would follow the very first introduction we have in the way of the kingdom of God was to be preached uh was to be preached was when he went out to the 12 sent out the 12 in Matthew 12 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he told them uh he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of of disease now the names of the twel Apostles are these first Simon who was called Peter Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee John his brother philli and uh bartha Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the Publican James the son of alfus and lebes uh whose surname was thadius uh Simon the Canaanite Judas es scariot who also betrayed him these 12 Jesus sent forth commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely you have received freely give the ministry that he gave gave them was actually the sharing of his own Ministry with them for it says in Matthew 9:35 to 38 Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them and because they had fainted and and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors into his Harvest now many people have the idea that just the apostles had this ministry given them by the Lord Jesus and so when they died the ministry was over that is not so here in Luke 10 1-9 we find that in the days of his Earthly Journey he had already already started to give Ministers of power or ministries of power to his own after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also and sent them two by two because his face uh before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come therefore said he unto them the Harvest truly is great but the labors are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth labors into his heart Harvest go your ways and behold uh I send you forth as Lambs Among Wolves carry neither purse nor script nor shoes and salute no man by the way and into whatsoever house ye enter safe first say peace be into this house if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn you again in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labor is worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into what who whatever City ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you who would dare deny the mighty works or the mighty Ministry of Phillip who would dare to deny the mighty ministries of irus Paul a Martin Columbus uh Patrick and countless scores of others who had God's anointing upon them yes the Bible Way is the real way of the open door I want to add to my Ministry add my Ministry to that the reason I have to do that is because I can only speak with Assurance concerning what God has done in my own life so if you'll excuse a personal note here I will tell you how I know for assurity that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and that the power of God is still available to those who will believe and receive during my missionary trip to South Africa God so blessed that I that when I came to Durban the only place that could begin to accommodate the people was the huge racetrack which is the second largest in the world the crowd was well over a 100,000 in order to keep Law and Order they had to put up fences to separate the various tribes they posted hundreds of policemen to keep the throngs quieted down those hungry SS had come for many miles a queen from rishia had come with a train of 27 coaches loaded with African natives they struggled across the fields and mountains bearing on their backs for many and many miles some loved one that needed help the whole country was stirred by the mighty works that had been manifested by the Holy Spirit one afternoon as I be to minister one of the thousands of muhammadans come up on the platform and she stood before me as she stood before me a missionary to the muhammadans began to softly implore the Lord oh for that precious Soul oh for that precious Soul he had been over there for years and years and according to his own testimony he had seen only one muhammadan come to receive Jesus Christ as Savior they were originally the metal Persians whose laws change not they are so hard to win it seems that once a Muhammad and always a muhammadan is a law among them well as she stood before me I begin to speak to her and to all those thousands through the interpreters I said 'it is not so uh is it not so the missionaries have told you of a Jesus who come to save you you should have been you should have seen the people look at each other when I said that when they had answered that it was correct I went on and said but did the missionaries read to you out of this book I held my Bible a loft for them to see that this same Jesus was a mighty healer and that he would live than his people down Through the Ages until he come again to receive them unto himself did they tell you that because of that same spirit in them that was in Jesus that they would be able to do the mighty works even as Jesus did did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved how many of you would like to see this same Jesus come down amongst us and do the same things that he did when he was here on Earth long ago they all wanted that that is one thing they surely agreed on I then went on if Jesus by his spirit will do what he did when on Earth will you believe his word then and here was the muhammadan woman in front of me and the spirit began to move through me I said to her now you know I don't know you I can't even speak your language she admitted that I said as for healing you know I cannot but you heard the message this afternoon and understood me her Indian interpreter answered back for her that she understood for that she had read the New Testament now the muhammadans are descendants of Abraham they believe in one God but they reject Jesus as the Son of God instead they take Muhammad as his Prophet they say that Jesus never died and rose again they are taught that by their priest and they believe it I said but Jesus did die and rise again he sent his Spirit back upon the church that Spirit was in that was in him is the very same spirit in the church now it can and will produce what Jesus produced he said in John 5:19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now then if Jesus will come and reveal to me what your trouble is or what you're here for if he can tell me what your past is surely you can believe for the future she said Through The Interpreter yes I can I said all right may he do it those muhammadans were watching intently they were all leaning forward to see what would happen then the Holy Spirit spoke your husband is a short heavys set man with a black mustache you have two children you were at the doctors about three days ago and he gave you an examination you have a cyst on the womb she bowed her head and said that is true I asked her how is it you come to me a Christian why didn't you go to your Muhammad prophet she said I think you can help me I said I can't help you but if you receive Jesus as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he'll help you and she said I accept Jesus as my savior that did it she was healed and about 10,000 mohammadans came to Christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power God never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he gave the open door of the word and power and that is what we are supposed to use that is what gave Paul his great effective Ministry First Corinthians 2 and 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power listen to me now it was while on this same trip that I was boarding a plane at New Salisbury Ro rhasia and that I saw a party of four with American passports I went over to them and said hello there I see you have American passports are you traveling somewhere the young man answered and no we are all missionaries here how nice I replied are you on your own or do you work with some organization we are Methodist we come from Wilmore Kentucky he said well that is almost in my backyard I replied you wouldn't be that brother brandham that comes up from that way would you I said yes that's right and that cured him he wouldn't say another thing and the way he and those three girls just look back and forth at each other so I said just a minute son I'd like to speak to you all about some principles seeing we're all Christians and here for a great purpose now you say that you all have uh uh you have all four been here two years can you say in the name of Jesus that you can put a finger on one so that you know you have one to the Lord they could not do it I don't want to hurt your feelings girls I said but you ought to be home helping your mothers with the dishes you haven't any business out on the on the field unless you are filled with the Holy Ghost preaching the true gospel in the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost if you're not seeing the results that Jesus said you would see it's because you're not preaching the true gospel Let Me Go a step further and show you just how things can be on the mission field I don't say it is all this way but I'm afraid too much of it is it was while I was on the same trip and turing around Durban with the mayor that I saw a native with a tag around his neck and he was packing an idol I asked him I asked my friend what that tag was for and he says uh he said when a native Embraces Christianity they put a tag on him that sure surprised me for here was a man calling himself a Christian carrying that Idol so I asked how that could be he said I can speak the language let's go over there and talk to him so we went over and the mayor acted as my interpreter I asked the native if he was a Christian he affirmed he surely was a Christian I then asked why he carried the idol if he was a Christian he answered that it was an idol his father had carried and he left it to him when I told him that no Christians ought to carry Idols he replied that the idol had been of great use to his father and he was I was curious to know how and he said that one day his father was being stalked by a lion so he built a fire and spoke and and spoke to the idol the way he had been taught by the witch doctor the lion left I informed him that it is not the fire that sent the lion off as fire scares all wild animals I will never forget his reply he said well it is this way if amoya the spirit fails then this Idol won't a detailed account of the African campaign may be found in the book William brandom a prophet visit South Africa that is just about all the strength the Christian multitudes have because the word was not brought to them by the the original Open Door of Pentecost you know and and just to say here do you understand why we must have the life of God in our personal lives and in our church every one of us must maintain that life form is not what God is looking at as I as I was mentioned in Sunday morning form is not it he's wanting his life manifested through US amen for we are the body of Jesus Christ now he says um now getting back to the open Mission door of the Philadelphian age it does it did not have the open door of power it ought to have had notice in the same verse he mentions this open door he he says Thou Hast little strength that is right the power of the spirit was missing in that age the word was well preached it was well able to make Souls wise into salvation the great power of God that showed forth his mighty works that made bear his arm in behalf of his own was missing except amongst the scattered groups yet praise God it was growing and it increased uh over what they had in the Reformation it was in this age that the man we often call the father of missions went out William Cary a village Shoemaker who pastored the particular Baptist Church at Molton England Mily aroused the People by preaching on whether the command given to the apostles to teach All Nations was uh obligatory on all uh succeeding ministers uh to the end of the world seeing that the accompanying power was of it of equal extent and he was he was fought by The calvinist Who had gone to the extreme of the doctrine of election believing that all who will be saved will be saved and Mission missionary work would be against the work of the spirit but the Andrew but Andrew Fuller helped Mr Cary by his preaching and fundraising such was their effect that a society was formed to spread the gospel to all nations in 1792 this Society sent out Carrie who was signally blessed of God in winning SS in India in 1795 an aroused Christianity formed the London missionary society which we well know raised millions of pounds and sent thousands of missionaries over the years to accomplish the desires of the Lord the spirit of God was moving and other sheep might well have been the Cry of the heart of those Earnest Believers I have set before thee an open door I want I want to look at these words again this time I'm not going to disassociate them from missions I'm going to bring you a thought that carries deep into the last age as I have already stated this age melts into the last age it was in this age that Jesus says I come quickly verse 11 and of the last age he was going to finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth Romans 9:28 notice how this verse of Revelations 3:8 goes Open Door little strength word name that open door has to do with all three now what does the door signify in John 10 and 7 it says uh then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep that is right I am is the door of the sheep now this is not just a quain expression this is actually so notice in John 10 when Jesus is giving this Parable he calls himself to the shepherd then he calls himself to uh he calls himself the shepherd then he calls himself the door and that is what the shepherd is to the Sheep he is actually their door when I was over in in the East I saw that at night time the shepherd would gather all his sheep together he would put them into the foe then he would count them and when he was sure that they were all in he would lie down in the open door of the fold and literally become the door of the fold no one could get in and out except by him he was the door the next day as I went riding with a friend in a jeep I noticed that a Shepherd began to lead his flock into the city right away all the traffic came to a stop so that the Sheep could go through now the cities over in the East aren't like they are here we keep all our merchandise inside but there it's like a big farmers market with all the produce on the pavement for the pass buyer to see and buy I thought oh my here is where the riot begins wait till those sheep see all that food out there but as the shepherd went ahead those sheep followed right along exactly in each step they would look at those goodies but not a sheep touched a thing oh if I could only have known their language I would have stopped traffic myself and preach them a sermon on what I had just seen when you are a sheep that belongs to the great Shepherd you follow right along in each of his steps just as those sheep did you you won't be tempted to turn aside by some big flower of a church or listen to the voice of some DD PhD or lld D but you will stay with the shepherd the Bible says that the Sheep know his voice and they follow him but a she but a stranger's voice will only cause them to flee and run after the true Shepherd praise God but that was not all I saw and learned over there one day I got to thinking about having seen men out in the field hurting different kinds of animals one fellow would be tending some pigs and another some goats and another some camels another mules Etc so I asked a friend who lived there what they called those men oh he replied they are Shepherds I couldn't take that I said you don't mean to say they are all Shepherds Shepherds only heard sheep don't they no he said a Shepherd is a herder or Grazer so anyone who grazes animals is a Shepherd well that did surprise me but I noticed a difference between those herders and one and the ones who took care of the sheep come nighttime all the others but the she Shepherd of the sheep left his animals in the field and went on home the shepherd took his sheep with him and put them into the foe and then laid down and became the door of the sheep oh praise God Our Shepherd never leaves us or forsakes us one night come when Night comes I want to be in his fold I want to be in his care can I hear a great big amen amen so his word is is Everything Jesus is the door door to the Sheep now the as as the door to the Sheep I want us to I I want us to to to consider that I think it's important for for us all especially as uh as parents uh as we were talking to the kids the other night uh and the importance of of you uh children respecting your your M and uh and your daddies but uh but the import import that we have as as um as as Shepherds because we're Shepherds and it's so important that that we when when when we tell when we tell you kids things and we're and we're we're teaching yall and and but it's but we're not just teaching you all um it's not like a um it's not like your your daddy is is this this big old egotistic guy and and saying hey you better listen to me because I cuz I do what I you you do what I say they are teaching you the ways of the Lord and when you're following and that's and that's the thing and that's and I and I I I I believe I can say that 100% for every parent in here we're not interested so much in you following us as much as we're interested in you following Jesus and we're teaching you to follow the ways of the Lord and so as as M and daddies amen what we say how we how we minister to to one another and to the children amen is is so important I as brother Brandon was talking about that open door and and things I I I just went I just I just started looking here at at some other places in the scripture that would go along with with with the open door and and Colossians 4 and 2 and sister keys if you would if you would put that up because we won't we don't have to turn there necessarily uh unless you want to but Colossians 4 and 2 the Apostle Paul is saying continue in prayer and watching the same with Thanksgiving with praying also for us uh the Apostle Paul that God would open unto us a door of entrance utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds that it might that I might make it manifest as I ought to speak walk in wisdom toward them that are without Redeeming the time let your speech be always with Grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man so the Apostle Paul is is talking the these this door of utterance is so important because you might not be a missionary you might not be a preacher but you do have a door of utterance to your family and what you what you speak what you do and not just her family but to one another I mean do we we we we are uh that this door of utterance we don't want it to just be the form but the power of Christ flowing out of us to others uh Ephesians 6: 19 uh here it's another place amen Ephesians 6:19 and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth mouth boldly to make the mystery known The Mystery of the Gospel amen um uh there in in Colossians 3 and16 amen it says let the word of God or the word of Christ dwell richly or dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing that word admonishing is encouraging one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your heart to the Lord and whatsoever you do and word and do do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him so as we as we look at this we can see that the Apostle Paul is saying that we all not just not just a church age messenger amen and not just an apostle just a a a pastor or a preacher but we all and in this case not just Mom and Daddy neither we all our communication with one another amen we are ministering Grace one to another let the word of God let this what what what word let this word of this generation this age so dwell in our hearts let us so um let let the let us abide in him and he abide in us let it let it be so rich so real so powerful in our lives amen that we even in our our conversations uh uh you know uh uh uh on on the playground or or or uh you know husbands and wives you know I I I even think about me and my wife how important it is for me to say the right words and keep keep Christ in the in the center of of our conversations and when she is doing it to me her words encourage me you see we take these words this message of the hour and and and we want to be rooted in this thing to where it's not just here but but to where it's it's part of our conversations it's not a coat we put on for church it's it's who we are and this conversation is is is is we we're careful what we say because the word of God is dwelling richly and we are encouraging and uplifting and and and and and and if someone's discouraged well we don't fall in the same trap with them we we encourage them because my day is coming where I'm going to be discouraged and I'm going to need someone to encourage me because that's what that's what we are as a body yes sir right well praise the Lord amen and so so uh uh uh so we you know you you can see you can see those things and actually if if you were to if you were to read all of that third chapter of of f of of Colossians uh it starts out amen uh uh uh set your affections on things which are above if you be risen set your affection on thing and then it automatically starts talking about love and it's talking about how we should operate with one another and then when it gets on down I mean there you know if you look there at the 12th verse says put on therefore as the elect holy and beloved vows in Mercy and kindness and humbleness of Mind meekness and longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgive you so also you do do ye above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be thankful let let the word of God dwell in you richly with all wisdom teaching and admonishing encouraging one another in Psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your heart and whatsoever you do in word and deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father by him can you say Amen look look there in in in Ephesians 5 and and 19 amen talking about speaking again that that door of utterance um there in in Ephesians 5 5 and 19 speaking to and that word to is amongst amen uh uh speaking amongst yourselves in Psalms hymns spiritual songs and singing and making melody in your heart to the lord always giving uh giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of the Lord Jesus can you say Amen so so and even here Ephesians 4:29 amen and I think I I think we should turn here on this one cuz this one is good it it's it's a good one to have marked in your Bible uh Ephesians 4 and 29 praise the Lord oh my that you know sort of tying in with our uh Sunday words oh words are powerful and we need to train ourselves to speak the right words by your tongue you're condemned or by your tongue you're Justified so we got to train ourselves to say the right words amen amen keep it in it so so there in Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying now now here's here's the Beautiful the word you Minister this open door that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers help me Lord that means I don't have to be behind a Pulpit that I need to be careful at what I'm saying even outside the pull pit that means I need to be careful of what I'm saying uh uh to to my wife I've got to be careful I had Hur I had heard a young man the other day not meaning to my my intentions were totally were totally pure amen but I but IID hurt this young man and and and it was and when I had when I had seen that then I had to look at that and think go back and and and think okay I then I need to I I need to read I I to readjust or or rethink the way that I I would do something like that so it's important for me I it everything that is done should be done with the edification in mind edification amen and so when we're all when when we are all doing that with one another our goal our goal is Lord I am a minister you're a minister amen you're a minister and what you say to someone else matters and what you say to someone else matters what you say about your brother matters amen what you say about your brother matters it all matters one to another so we we want the word of God not to just hear it but let it dwell richly let me dwell upon these words let this word become so rich and fertile that it just comes out of me where I am not portraying wend Martin but to where I am portraying Jesus Christ and making sure that we are all amen that that whoever's around me is growing in the admonition of the Lord Jesus Christ can you say Amen so so we we want to do that because if not if we if we if we get into the if we get into this this um frame of mind you know uh uh if if if if if the word isn't dwelling richly in US something's going to if the word isn't dwelling there then there's going to be then then whatever's then it'll vacate with pride and and and and and Malice and and bicker and and and feuding and and those kinds of things that dwell in us or that it something's going to take its place amen and the scripture says there in James um James I I believe the the the first chapter toward the end of it amen he says he says you you got to look into that perfect law of Liberty and and you've got to you you've got to realize that I'm not just a hearer but I want the word to become a doer I don't want this just to come here but it's important that it that it is manifested through me and he says now if that does not happen if you're just a hearer and you're not a doer he says then that that man is one who has come looked into the mirror and then forgot what he has done matter of fact let's just turn there real quickly now before we dismiss let's let's look at James 1 I think [Music] um I I loved I I love that this church book here this the church age book that that we have and um so many good things in it you know let's see and and it's a good one for for you guys to uh mark down there let's see James 1 yeah um okay so let's let's look here at the I don't know uh J let's just break in here at James 1: 19 wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save there your souls but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own s for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like un to a man beholding his natural face in a glass a mirror for he beholdeth himself goeth his way and straightway forgiveth what manner of man he was but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein him being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deeds If any man among you seem to be religious religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is in vain so so here he is he is saying your ministry the ministry is not okay I've got a good deed I've got to do you know I need to do something to I need to go um I need to go visit so and so I need to go uh talk to somebody about Jesus it it's it's it's it's not having its perfect effect yet because the life of God is what we're interested in not not not not not how many Deeds we're doing remember the Deeds aren't the form is not what God's looking for what God's looking for is the heart what God's looking for is that word having its effect in us so Lord let me be a hearer but Lord live it through me manifest it through me does that make sense amen and when it does Amen that will that that will be a Ministry to everyone you come in contact with Hallelujah so I say today that there there is an Open Door for Madison there is an Open Door amen not just for brother Joshua amen but but there's an open door for brother Connor there there's not just for brother Connor but there's an open door I I was going to pick on the two twins back there but they're sleeping on me amen uh um but but for every one of us it's an Open Door Lord What I Hear sitting on these pews put it in my heart put it in my heart amen how many wants to have a Ministry of your own God I want it to be a holy ghost Ministry Lord live through me manifest through me amen so I thought I would I I just I you know uh as I was as I was reading this today um it it it's already hit me that open door I've got an Open Door you've got an Open Door in this last day it's the open door cuz he says that open door is still going Hallelujah the Bride of Jesus Christ will be the final voice to the final age she under her messenger well glory to God glory to God all right now does anyone have anything they want to add to that any uh anything you want to uh to add had or any questions y'all might have praise the Lord amen Oh I thought you had a question praise the lord well glory to God all right amen did y'all enjoy that tonight wasn't that isn't that just awesome I I love it so we want now and and and and as we as we get ready to dismiss and you can uh the musicians can come but um go going back if you don't if you don't keep the word of God dwelling richly amen and you then then you'll you'll grieve the holy spirit in your life and the worst thing we could ever do there's nothing more miserable than a Christian that is that that is a Son of God and he's just got Plum full of bitterness he just so so Plum full of bitterness and and I've seen you know and in my um and and and this ain't putting him down CU my grandfather was a very good man uh loved the Lord my my grandfather wrote some of the most incredible songs songs with great meaning he was the one of the most giving guys around loved the Lord he was just incredible but he died in bitterness and and the good that he had the good that he had was sort of overshadowed by the bitterness and and I've I've thought of that often I think we need to guard our heart especially in this day where the book where where the veil has been taken off of Satan's Playbook because we know we know how Satan's going to operate we know his tactics so really bitterness is not an option for us as long as we choose to let the word of God dwell richly in US bitterness is not an option The Playbook is open we know what Satan's going to do he's going to do it he does it every church he does it in every family he does it in every individual he does it in every nation it's going to happen and every one of us are going to be given the opportunity to become bitter but the scripture says at one time ignorance God winked at but when the Revelation comes now it becomes sin it now becomes sin so now here here we we look and we say God then I'm going I'm going to do what I have to do we know you know if it's between you and your wife you and your husband you you you you you you you've got to just look you just got to look in the mirror and say you know through the opening of the word and through the Vindicated voice of God in this generation you know fella that I am pointing to in the mirror you know that that devil that is fighting me and my wife or me and my husband or me and my child is the same devil that is trying to take out that family and other families around trying to destroy us you look in that mirror and you say I'm going to bring every thought I'm going to bring every imagination I'm going to bring everything under the control of God's word don't let anything don't let anything come in between that don't let anything close the door the open door is Christ the open door is the manifestation of love don't let anything come in between that and usually when you think of it and that way you're going to go to the person who's done you wrong you're going to go to the person that you think should should be better or whatever it is usually the reason why there is a conflict is because it takes two to have a conflict and you forgive you just simply forgive what she does or he does it's it's not that's not that's not what we're after what you're after is keeping your door open and sooner or later that Ministry that Open Door amen is going to have that fact that love amen how many wants to be a minister I want to be a minister this is behind the pull pit that's only that's only 5% of a Preacher that's that that's just 5% Ministry is not here Ministry is here mama you're not you can say that Ministry is 24/7 right Mary it's 247 you don't get the opportunity to put it on and turn it off you're a minister at heart keep it flowing keep it full of life let the presence of the Lord just always be in every one of us amen amen God bless you just no more to I want to love love to there's just no

give let me love love there's just no more love I can never ever out the Lord amen amen I love him love him with all of my heart the I was thinking about bitterness in that story I just told him of my grandfather there in the book of Hebrews it talks about I believe it's the 13th chapter and L root of bitterness spring up in your heart and defile many it's always a door of utterance I want to be I want to make sure that the holy spirit is is is flowing through me don't let the root of bitterness spring up just seems like the spirit of the Lord is just dealing with that and just many scriptures are coming to my mind right now just just these things coming through us we don't want those things let this door be a door a true door not a hirling not one that's just looking for his own a door
