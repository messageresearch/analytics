[36:14] a little higher and a little higher and

[36:46] we're supposed to be as Sons and
[36:47] Daughters of God achieve the heights

[41:01] that's what this Bible is it's it's all
[41:04] about you and in you we find out who we
[41:08] are God oh Lord I ask you to move me out
[41:11] of the way father and and take over and

[42:14] sense because without my wife sometimes
[42:17] I feel like I can't do anything yeah you

[42:55] be for him
[43:00] amen oh I love it now we're going to go

[43:08] brother soise Lord when brother wend was

[43:36] to restore being mean not to restore no
[43:39] restore my laughter but you got to
[43:43] remember everything that he created in
[43:44] me was for him and his glory so my
[43:49] laughter is his laughter my my joy is
[43:53] his Joy when I get the happiness of
[43:56] something good happening in my life he's
[43:59] getting Joy from doing something good in
[44:03] my life so when he was telling his
[44:06] testimony and he was talking about how
[44:08] they were all laughing at him and and
[44:10] saying no no no no whatever but he
[44:12] didn't he gets all the stuff and he gets
[44:13] in there and he gets to bend in the pipe
[44:15] you said and really just reading and
[44:18] practicing and doing because you were
[44:20] going to do it you see you was going to
[44:24] have the last say come on right you
[44:29] wanted to be the
[44:30] champion well us as
[44:33] Christians ought to want to have the
[44:35] last say come on we want to have the
[44:39] last bit of
[44:42] joy that out there is
[44:45] theirs plain and simple none of that joy
[44:49] that entertainment that nonsense is
[44:53] ours none of it yeah but through all the
[44:56] scoffing and through all the laughing
[44:59] and through all of the picking fun
[45:01] because we stand and say I believe do
[45:05] you know how much the smirks and the
[45:07] laughs and the Grins and the people
[45:09] almost choking and stuff when I tell
[45:11] them I have two perfectly good eyes

[45:27] I'll see it that one they're like he's
[45:29] crazy he's nuts you know that's all in
[45:32] scripture that's all back on paper none
[45:34] of that stuff happens anymore so what do
[45:37] I do I go and I read and I been and I
[45:42] study and like the willow tree I form
[45:45] myself to the word of God because when
[45:49] this is all said and
[45:50] done I'm going to be laughing all right
[45:54] but I promise you I'm not going to be
[45:55] laughing laughing at them like they're
[45:58] laughing at me I'm going to be laughing
[46:01] because standing before them is the full
[46:05] interpretation and the full
[46:06] manifestation of the word of God that
[46:09] they said couldn't happen and for the
[46:11] glory of God I will be laughing because
[46:15] I'll be like I told you God was real I
[46:18] told you God would do it and I am
[46:20] looking for that
[46:23] day so yes restore to me restore my
[46:27] laughter my what the the exuberance is
[46:30] that the right word the I don't even
[46:32] know I'm so excited I don't even know
[46:34] how to profess it in the English
[46:35] language but to be able to just say this
[46:38] is God he done it his word he said it
[46:41] it's right here look he done it you
[46:44] remember me yesterday now look at me
[46:48] today oh and you can't help but laugh
[46:52] that's right when the spirit of the Lord
[46:55] Lord falls upon this place I will dance
[46:59] like David danced I'm not going to get a
[47:02] loin cloth praise the Lord but he
[47:05] danced and he danced and he danced and
[47:08] he was so excited to see the words of
[47:11] his time coming back to its rightful
[47:14] place coming back to where it was
[47:16] supposed to be he was so excited he was
[47:19] dancing they were shouting they were
[47:21] screaming they were
[47:24] laughing oh oh they were so excited
[47:27] everything's going so good all
[47:30] excited and then there's his
[47:36] wife now before I'm going to get into
[47:38] what she thought about the whole
[47:41] thing do you realize that she had been
[47:44] there with David from the beginning
[47:47] yeah she had been around when Goliath
[47:51] was
[47:52] slain she had been right there the
[47:55] king's daughter yeah I mean she had been
[47:57] right there married to David watched him
[48:00] slay his tens David Saul his thousands
[48:02] and David his
[48:04] 10,000s she had been right there she
[48:06] heard it she seen it with her own eyes
[48:09] she knew everything of the what he was
[48:13] anointed and she knew it and if you go
[48:17] to the first chapter of Samuel I believe
[48:20] it is it even said on there that they
[48:22] had reported to Saul that she loved
[48:26] David now do you know that she was the
[48:28] second
[48:30] choice well he was supposed to marry the
[48:32] other daughter but Saul married her off
[48:35] and said well since she loves you we'll
[48:36] just give you her and she loved David so
[48:39] she was all excited about it so David
[48:41] ended up with the other daughter kind of
[48:43] bring up like another story supposed to
[48:45] marry Rachel but ended up with Leah
[48:48] right but anyways so this wasn't even
[48:50] but she loved David yeah but after so
[48:55] many years years yeah of being the
[48:59] best so many years of being the cream of
[49:02] the crop so many years of everything
[49:06] just being oh she's so perfect she loves
[49:09] David David loves her David's the
[49:11] greatest David's this David and she's
[49:15] David's wife and she's all up here now
[49:17] she was the daughter of the king went
[49:21] all the way to the Bride of the queen or
[49:23] the king depends on what part of the
[49:25] world I guess all that stuff
[49:28] going and through it all when she looked
[49:32] out there and saw him rejoicing in the
[49:35] word of God the Bible says she despised
[49:42] him yeah she's like what in the world do
[49:47] you think you're
[49:50] doing we have to stand up to all of
[49:53] these people they're going to remember
[49:55] this your legacy is going to be
[49:59] that and in reality his legacy was going
[50:04] to be that but not his
[50:08] nakedness his dancing all right she was
[50:13] right but she wasn't right all right how
[50:18] many years do we sit here listen to it
[50:21] rejoice in it feel the presence of God
[50:25] do it keep coming flows over you you're
[50:28] so excited like you're the bride yep yep
[50:31] yep you go out and tell everybody yep
[50:33] yep yep I'm the bride this is it year
[50:36] after year after year and then somebody
[50:39] new comes in and they get just a wee bit
[50:42] out of line you're like what in the
[50:45] world forget that some oldtime all the
[50:49] sudden get to hold that Holy Spirit and
[50:51] or not jumps up and starts
[50:52] running across the floor then what you
[50:54] thought they're too old for that are you
[50:55] kidding
[50:57] me come
[51:00] on well that's what she was doing
[51:04] yeah in her mind she was criticizing the
[51:08] move of the spirit all
[51:11] right she had been around it so long she
[51:15] had heard it so long that she was
[51:18] actually weighted
[51:19] down by the
[51:24] truth
[51:25] he was the king he was anointed he was
[51:29] he was going to be king right I mean she
[51:32] had it all I mean she had the truth she
[51:34] had
[51:35] everything but she couldn't take one
[51:38] little
[51:40] thing okay not little thing probably a
[51:42] big thing there's a lot of people out
[51:43] there you know and I'm sure if April saw
[51:46] me out there dancing like that too she'd
[51:47] probably be like wait a second you
[51:48] better make sure you're in the spirit
[51:51] buddy right but I don't think she would
[51:53] have despised me you know I don't think
[51:56] she would have looked at it as something
[51:57] that was really really bad something
[51:59] that was just going to ruin them because
[52:01] you know what happened to her she became
[52:06] Barren she wasn't
[52:08] fruitful she was still the daughter of
[52:11] the king she was still the Bride of
[52:13] David he didn't put her away like
[52:16] bashy that ain't what the Bible said the
[52:18] Bible just said all right he said all
[52:20] right then I'll go somewhere else and
[52:22] she was Barren till the day she died
[52:28] sometimes oh Lord help me sometimes in
[52:32] Our
[52:34] Truth our truth because a belief is not
[52:38] always
[52:39] true
[52:40] okay A belief is not always fact so you
[52:45] can believe it's somebody in the flesh
[52:47] all you want to it doesn't make it a
[52:49] fact that they're not in the
[52:53] spirit or you can believe they're in the
[52:56] spirit all day long and and the only
[52:58] person that knows is them and God that's
[53:00] the honest goodness truth the only
[53:02] people to know so instead
[53:05] of joining in and thinking to myself
[53:08] well I don't know about that you
[53:11] know well you know hope hope hopefully
[53:14] it's God they're up dancing and I'm
[53:17] unsure about it you know what I'm going
[53:18] to do cuz I am sure about me that is one
[53:21] thing I can say is I am sure about me
[53:24] and if you ever catch me dancing it's
[53:26] going to be in the spirit cuz I don't
[53:30] dance plain and simple that's just the
[53:32] truth I sing very quietly I clap my
[53:35] hands I you know I I love to worship God
[53:38] but I do it in my own little bubble I I
[53:41] honestly I do sometimes I get in my
[53:44] bubble so much that I don't even know
[53:45] what goes on on the house for hours it's
[53:48] my bubble it's my time I'm in his
[53:50] presence it's mine and I want it that's
[53:54] my time
[53:55] yeah so if we would spend our time in
[53:58] that then maybe just maybe we wouldn't
[54:01] have to say what we said about that and
[54:05] stun our own
[54:08] growth CU we're not supposed to judge
[54:10] nobody
[54:11] right and I don't want to stunt my
[54:13] growth in God because I just told you
[54:14] that I want to get high as a
[54:17] kite literally High yeah right I mean
[54:22] that's just the truth I want to dance in
[54:23] the spirit I I don't want to stomp
[54:26] myself so if we flip this around there
[54:28] was another
[54:30] wife and her name was
[54:32] Sarah all right so her husband comes to
[54:35] her and says guess what she's like what
[54:37] you're going to have a baby what come on
[54:41] man all right if you say so you know no
[54:45] seriously God told me oh I'm sure he did
[54:47] I believe you you know she just goes on
[54:49] with her life how in the world am I
[54:51] going to have a baby how am I going to
[54:54] have a baby yeah right she never denied
[54:57] it she never oh no no I don't know how
[54:59] that's going to happen but you know okay
[55:03] 10 years go by you're going to have a
[55:04] baby yeah that's what she said well you
[55:06] know we're around so much so that she
[55:09] said well maybe just maybe you got the
[55:11] steps of it wrong take my servant she'll
[55:14] have the baby everybody will quit
[55:15] laughing at us this will be done and
[55:18] we'll go I can almost see Abraham said
[55:21] no that ain't what God Said and you know
[55:23] being a good wife yeah but this is
[55:25] probably you misunderstood you know you
[55:27] don't hear very good you're getting
[55:29] old you know so this is probably the way
[55:32] it's OB he said all right let's do
[55:35] it they had the baby and it wasn't God's
[55:39] baby because once that baby was born
[55:42] jealousy ripped through that
[55:45] house she the one was like well I'm
[55:48] Queen now she's like no you're not well
[55:49] it's my kid no it ain't it's mine I'm
[55:51] taking it away from you oh no no no no
[55:53] anyway jealousy running so far that he
[55:56] guy had to
[55:57] go but you understand it wasn't Sarah
[56:02] that had to go nobody said Sarah you
[56:05] made a mistake nobody come in and said
[56:07] Sarah I despise you for doing this yeah
[56:14] hegar she was a servant it's not like
[56:17] she had a
[56:19] choice it was give him a baby or get
[56:22] kicked out and you know what ended up
[56:24] happening she got kicked
[56:27] out it's not like she had a choice so
[56:30] why would you kick her out instead of
[56:33] kicking Sarah
[56:36] out right because Sarah believed they
[56:40] were going to have a baby she didn't per
[56:43] se understand and believe how the baby
[56:46] was going to come but she still believed
[56:49] in the moving of the spirit she still
[56:51] believed Abraham talked to God she still
[56:54] believed that the spirit was there she
[56:56] believed all of that and remember
[56:59] Abraham's belief was accounted to him
[57:01] for righteousness well if Sarah is part
[57:03] of
[57:04] Abraham otherwise she would have died in
[57:07] the
[57:09] tent I mean she pretty much said laughed
[57:12] right in his face and said
[57:16] me and then no I didn't think
[57:19] that
[57:23] um but she believed beli D God's word
[57:26] right she didn't per se believe that it
[57:29] was going to come through her but she
[57:31] believed there would be a son and
[57:34] through the belief through her own
[57:36] little bubble through all of that there
[57:39] was a
[57:41] renewing now mind you it was Abraham's
[57:45] belief that was accounted to him for
[57:47] righteousness he staggered not at the
[57:50] promise all right her respect for him
[57:53] was never going to call him a
[57:55] liar
[57:57] okay but it became a
[58:01] renewing until they were made young
[58:04] again which brings us back to the
[58:08] eagle that he was preaching on a while
[58:11] back brother brandom told this tells the
[58:14] story and about how an eagle renews
[58:16] itself because in the Scriptures it says
[58:17] you know to renew Like an Eagle right so
[58:21] he was saying how an eagle as it gets
[58:23] about a generation or 30 40 years
[58:26] old all right its eyes gets crusted up
[58:29] and its beak because you know their beak
[58:30] and Talons and everything grows all the
[58:31] time never stops so and that is the you
[58:35] know scientifically proven fact so if it
[58:37] builds all up and crust all over they
[58:40] brother brandom said that that eagle
[58:41] would fly up into a cliff of The Rock
[58:45] and beat his head or her head against
[58:49] this rock to bust all that stuff
[58:52] off and as it was doing this over a
[58:55] period of time it would lose all of its
[58:56] feathers pull out the bad ones get all
[58:59] new feathers and basically fly off the
[59:02] mountain like a brand new Young Eagle
[59:07] yeah well let's take that back then
[59:11] sitting in church five years 10 years 15
[59:15] years 20 years 30 years eyes are getting
[59:19] a little cloudy even the prophet John
[59:21] said it well go ask him his eyes got
[59:24] cloudy
[59:27] well let me tell you something brothers
[59:29] and sisters bent knees breaks
[59:34] chains it does bent knees brings about
[59:39] all of the impossibilities you could
[59:41] ever
[59:43] imagine a bent
[59:48] knee not crossed
[59:53] arms well I don't know I wonder what the
[59:56] day is coming and wonder what's going to
[59:58] happen today I wonder what this is going
[1:00:00] to bring
[1:00:02] no oh Lord I don't know I don't know if
[1:00:05] they're right I don't know if they're
[1:00:06] wrong but Lord help them help me to
[1:00:09] understand benty is what breaks the
[1:00:15] chains
[1:00:18] amen oh I I jumped way ahead praise the
[1:00:22] Lord I love I love doing that so that's
[1:00:24] just okay I jumped way ahead let me back
[1:00:28] up
[1:00:30] so through all of that yeah they were
[1:00:33] made young
[1:00:35] again so much so that a young king
[1:00:37] wanted to marry her and you all know the
[1:00:38] story it was a poor Abraham was a coward
[1:00:42] said well I'm just going to tell them
[1:00:44] you're my sister I ain't
[1:00:45] lying
[1:00:47] technically
[1:00:49] technically there's no such thing as a
[1:00:52] technically not lying if you're Happ to
[1:00:53] say I'm technically not lying lying
[1:00:54] you're probably
[1:00:56] lying that one's free um so but anyways
[1:01:00] and then God comes down because why God
[1:01:02] said I created everything for me you're
[1:01:04] for me Sarah the promise Abraham was all
[1:01:07] was for his glory it wasn't for that
[1:01:09] little young King's Glory it wasn't for
[1:01:11] Abraham's Glory it wasn't even for
[1:01:13] Sarah's Glory it was for his glory and
[1:01:16] so they brought them back together and
[1:01:17] boom within that year in the time of
[1:01:19] life they had a son and she named him
[1:01:24] Isaac
[1:01:25] ISAC and this is where April came in and
[1:01:28] said you know Isaac means laughter right
[1:01:31] oh yeah I never knew
[1:01:34] that well anyways if she could have
[1:01:36] heard the screaming down there she
[1:01:38] probably realized I never knew that but
[1:01:39] I do
[1:01:43] now and I like this because in Genesis
[1:01:45] 21-6 it named it Isaac and said goth God
[1:01:49] hath made me to laugh so that all that
[1:01:53] hear
[1:01:55] will laugh with me all
[1:01:59] right oh what a difference not laughing
[1:02:03] at her anymore oh no more are they
[1:02:05] scoffing at her no more are they going
[1:02:08] oh yeah right you're you're you're out
[1:02:09] there you're crazy you need to go get
[1:02:11] medicine no more of all of that no now
[1:02:14] when she sat in there laughing I told
[1:02:16] you look at my baby look at my son his
[1:02:18] name is Isaac every single time somebody
[1:02:20] said the name Isaac they were laughing
[1:02:21] with her yeah because Isaac May laughed
[1:02:23] her
[1:02:24] yeah so even if it came another
[1:02:27] generation down the road that they
[1:02:28] didn't remember the story and she was
[1:02:30] telling them and they're like really
[1:02:32] Isaac as soon as they say Isaac they
[1:02:34] were laughing with her because Isaac me
[1:02:36] laughed
[1:02:38] her and she was laughing she had the
[1:02:40] Little P patter feet of her own child
[1:02:43] her own going she had it there I mean
[1:02:47] brothers and sisters her laughter was
[1:02:49] there she had her laughter and then one
[1:02:52] day Abraham comes in there and says
[1:02:55] Isaac grab up the stuff we're out of
[1:02:57] here and Sarah's like excuse me he's
[1:03:00] like oh don't worry he's going with me
[1:03:03] uh this don't look right well woman
[1:03:06] just all right and he goes up and he
[1:03:10] goes up the mountain to do what God told
[1:03:12] him to do because he truly believed God
[1:03:16] and out of his belief for God he looked
[1:03:17] at him and said don't worry me and no l
[1:03:18] will come
[1:03:21] back because his laughter was already
[1:03:23] there yeah yeah he he he could laugh all
[1:03:27] day long God told him you're going to
[1:03:30] take your son up there and you're going
[1:03:32] to kill
[1:03:33] him well Hallelujah anyhow don't let the
[1:03:38] devil get me down come on
[1:03:40] Isaac well it's the same way with you
[1:03:43] bent knees breaks chains breaking of a
[1:03:47] chain brings a
[1:03:50] revelation you can't be healed if you
[1:03:53] ain't sick yes you can't be delivered if
[1:03:55] you ain't bound so every time that you

[1:10:48] cheerleader woo turned that one around
[1:10:51] didn't
[1:10:52] we well you can get up in the morning
[1:10:55] look yourself right in the mirror and go
[1:10:58] I got
[1:11:00] this all
[1:11:01] [Laughter]
[1:11:04] right
[1:11:07] amen look in the mirror and go well good
[1:11:10] morning
[1:11:12] Jesus well you
[1:11:14] are he changed your
[1:11:18] name do you ever wonder why in a
[1:11:21] marriage the woman's supposed to change
[1:11:22] your name I never understood how they
[1:11:24] got a round from that and the women
[1:11:26] don't change the names and still have
[1:11:28] two separate names well obviously
[1:11:29] they're not married because when you
[1:11:31] become married it's a name
[1:11:33] change so if you are the bride the wife
[1:11:35] of Jesus Christ you had a name change
[1:11:37] brothers and sisters you are Mrs Jesus
[1:11:48] Christ and when my wife and I got
[1:11:50] married and we went down to the bank
[1:11:54] I didn't just put her name on my bank
[1:11:59] account I didn't have a bank account I
[1:12:02] opened up a bank account in her
[1:12:06] name and mine and deposited my income
[1:12:11] into that bank
[1:12:13] account I'm going somewhere with that
[1:12:17] yes it's my bank account yes it's her
[1:12:20] bank
[1:12:21] account yes it's a joint account but
[1:12:25] when you get an email on that account it
[1:12:28] says John's woman that's her email
[1:12:30] address
[1:12:31] anyway you just got a deposit made into
[1:12:34] your account it doesn't
[1:12:38] say Mr John Mr torren you got money
[1:12:41] deposited that ain't what it
[1:12:44] says we overdraw that account and it
[1:12:47] says John's woman you wrote too many
[1:12:51] checks okay now this is hey she picked
[1:12:55] that email address believe it or not
[1:12:56] it's John's woman 2000 because we got
[1:12:58] married in 2000 I love that she'll never
[1:13:01] change that email address I promise
[1:13:04] you anyways but every
[1:13:08] interaction with that bank account yeah
[1:13:12] is in her name
[1:13:14] okay my name's on the bank account if it
[1:13:17] wasn't they would do her no good she
[1:13:20] don't have no
[1:13:22] money was true you
[1:13:24] don't I'm going to sit down here for
[1:13:26] just a
[1:13:28] second she doesn't have any money right
[1:13:32] plain and
[1:13:33] simple plain and simple she doesn't work
[1:13:38] even if she did work she still wouldn't
[1:13:40] have any
[1:13:41] money it be my
[1:13:48] money it I had to sit down for that one
[1:13:51] brother the reason I'm saying saying
[1:13:53] that is is everything that I own
[1:13:55] everything that I have is hers
[1:13:58] everything and yet everything is
[1:14:03] mine if my name wasn't on the bank
[1:14:06] account she couldn't do anything with it
[1:14:09] because nothing would get deposited into
[1:14:10] it nothing would get they would look at
[1:14:13] it and say but you don't
[1:14:15] work and she's like yeah well I'm but
[1:14:18] since my name's on there and we go down
[1:14:20] to get a loan if we need to get a loan
[1:14:22] or we want to buy car and we go down
[1:14:24] there and she writes her name down she
[1:14:27] can't buy that car until I write my name
[1:14:30] down because I have the
[1:14:35] income I put it in the bank yeah all
[1:14:41] right going somewhere with
[1:14:44] this we have a bank
[1:14:49] account right
[1:14:51] here this yeah is our bank
[1:14:56] account everything in there has our name
[1:14:58] on
[1:14:59] it everything healing has your name on
[1:15:04] it Deliverance has your name on it
[1:15:07] finances has your name on it every
[1:15:09] single thing in there has your name on
[1:15:13] it now on that account is another name
[1:15:17] and that is Mr Jesus Christ right and
[1:15:21] he's the one that funds that account all
[1:15:24] right okay all right so now in the
[1:15:28] worldly sense when I know and I
[1:15:31] understand that some ladies have to work
[1:15:32] and I'm not I'm not saying that just for
[1:15:34] me in April I know her band payments due
[1:15:38] I make sure there's money in that
[1:15:40] account to cover that band payment the
[1:15:43] insurance is coming up due I make sure
[1:15:45] there's money in there to pay that
[1:15:48] insurance right and then if I'm looking
[1:15:51] at the accounts going oh no I I ain't
[1:15:53] got no money to put in there guess what
[1:15:55] I do I work more hours to get more money
[1:15:59] to put in the
[1:16:01] account God has
[1:16:05] everything this account will
[1:16:07] never ever you you talk about like you
[1:16:10] know all these big billionaires in the
[1:16:13] world that have all the money they have
[1:16:15] so much money that they throw money at
[1:16:17] each other trying to make each other
[1:16:18] fail I mean that's how much money they
[1:16:20] have they never want for anything
[1:16:23] typical Le oia rich and yet they're
[1:16:26] broke right but they have all that money
[1:16:28] to do anything and everything they want
[1:16:29] to do and yet they absolutely have
[1:16:31] nothing and the reason I say that is
[1:16:33] watch their marriage life watch the
[1:16:35] things that they go through watch
[1:16:37] through that no you all that money does
[1:16:42] them no good
[1:16:45] none so it ain't the money in this
[1:16:48] account even though it's in there for me
[1:16:50] to pay my bills talking about the Bible
[1:16:54] my finances are in
[1:16:56] that the Bible said if I pay my ties and
[1:17:00] I pay my
[1:17:01] offerings okay as long as I don't go
[1:17:03] crazy and try to spend a billion dollars
[1:17:05] and make a thousand I can cover my
[1:17:07] bills okay but what's in this bank
[1:17:10] account that I want more than anything
[1:17:13] in the
[1:17:15] world all right is Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ you're like you just said it was
[1:17:22] a bank account yep I did and he makes
[1:17:25] deposits into it yep he does so
[1:17:27] everything that he puts into that he
[1:17:29] puts in of
[1:17:30] himself if I'm going to put money in my
[1:17:33] bank account I have to take myself to go
[1:17:35] make the money to put the money inside
[1:17:38] the bank account so when I put money in
[1:17:40] that bank account to pay the bills I'm
[1:17:41] putting into that account of
[1:17:46] myself this Bible is written to explain
[1:17:51] to you who Jesus Jesus Christ is okay
[1:17:56] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:59] and in the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:18:02] the revelation of Mrs Jesus
[1:18:06] Christ bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh
[1:18:10] okay so in this bank account he has put
[1:18:15] everything of
[1:18:19] him he said I go to prepare a place for

[1:19:17] William Brandon preach I never got to
[1:19:20] see his big meetings where he discerned
[1:19:22] the thoughts of the hearts I never got
[1:19:25] to see it I never got to feel the
[1:19:27] presence of God that strong I never got
[1:19:29] to hear him speak out across to say well
[1:19:31] there's a light right there there's this
[1:19:33] I never physically ever got to be in
[1:19:37] that

[1:19:42] a deposit into my account about 1,200 of
[1:19:48] them to where I can at least hear what
[1:19:52] happened I can at least hear the
[1:19:55] testimony I can think to myself oo o
[1:19:58] that look look there he just spoke to
[1:20:00] that lady he said that garter was
[1:20:02] rolling across oh my goodness look at

[1:20:43] going to happen you may have never
[1:20:46] physically seen somebody saved out of
[1:20:49] the depths of Despair so bad that when
[1:20:51] they finally stand before a mirror
[1:20:53] they're completely new people but you
[1:20:56] can believe it can
[1:20:59] happen cuz he said
[1:21:01] it because he said it so if the time
[1:21:06] that's gone on has clouded our vision
[1:21:09] and the time that's got on has covered
[1:21:12] our eyes to where we can't see as
[1:21:15] clearly closed our beaks to where we
[1:21:17] can't eat as well there's still a rock
[1:21:22] to beat your head against there's still
[1:21:25] an altar to Fall on Your Knees at
[1:21:28] there's still a place to go to say God
[1:21:32] forgive meu clear out my eyes and
[1:21:36] restore my laughter the laughter that
[1:21:40] said anything that's possible the
[1:21:42] laughter that looked Satan in the eye
[1:21:44] and said not today the laughter that
[1:21:47] said I don't care if it's been 20 years

[1:22:01] what it's going to happen there's a lot
[1:22:03] of message believing people there's a
[1:22:05] lot of good stuff that can happen today
[1:22:08] it may not be mine my Ain my time may
[1:22:10] not have come but there's something good
[1:22:13] going to happen
[1:22:16] today because God said it and I believe
[1:22:19] it and if it don't happen for me it'll
[1:22:21] happen for him and my day will be
[1:22:24] tomorrow but it's going to
[1:22:27] happen so I can laugh and I can dance

[1:23:48] bit I really am always have been that
[1:23:50] quiet guy in the corner
[1:23:53] never said much kept my mouth shut
[1:23:57] April we we'd go on a 10-hour
[1:23:59] trip and I'd probably say three words
[1:24:03] and she never shut
[1:24:07] up hey and I loved it I still do yeah
[1:24:12] she's because if she's talking my ear
[1:24:13] off she's happy yeah she's talking
[1:24:16] talking and she's happy and I can let my
[1:24:18] mind go here and that oh yeah yeah babe

[1:24:23] you got to listen to her otherwise you
[1:24:24] can't answer the questions when she ask
[1:24:26] them so obviously I'm listening all
[1:24:29] right but as you're as I'm going through
[1:24:32] life and she's just going and going and
[1:24:34] going and talking and talking and
[1:24:36] talking honey can the kids have a
[1:24:37] hamster honey can I put the gas in the
[1:24:40] van honey can I do this oh can you
[1:24:41] believe they're having a scun thing can
[1:24:43] we can we go to that and and it's going
[1:24:45] yeah yeah sure yeah yeah sure sometimes
[1:24:47] I feel like that's the way God is he's
[1:24:49] sitting there listening driving and
[1:24:51] you're just a chattering he's like oh oh
[1:24:52] my baby's
[1:24:54] happy yeah yeah yeah and then all of a
[1:24:57] sudden silence whoa what did I
[1:25:01] do I mean okay what's up all right if
[1:25:04] there's silence something's
[1:25:08] wrong okay it's the truth if there's
[1:25:12] silence something's wrong and sometimes
[1:25:14] I think he does the same thing he's like
[1:25:16] whoa there's silence and he steps over
[1:25:19] there closer to you he's listening to
[1:25:21] you is he they going to ask me he knows
[1:25:25] I'll give it to them I'll give them
[1:25:26] anything they want they're going to just
[1:25:28] ask me ask
[1:25:32] me and finally he's going to say all
[1:25:35] right and he's going to move on he's
[1:25:38] going to do or whatever he said he'd
[1:25:38] never leave you ref like you he's still
[1:25:40] around he's your husband he's there good
[1:25:42] whatever then all in a sudden you
[1:25:44] finally have enough of it and you're
[1:25:45] like Lord I wanted that van why didn't
[1:25:48] you
[1:25:51] ask
[1:25:53] I can't buy you a van I don't know you
[1:25:55] want well you know everything yeah but
[1:25:58] you got to ask
[1:26:00] me you have not because you ask
[1:26:06] not I'm sorry
[1:26:09] people you have not because you ask not
[1:26:13] you ask not because you don't
[1:26:19] believe you know there's
[1:26:22] that saying he say you know there's
[1:26:24] three types of Believers in every
[1:26:27] church and in my own humble honest
[1:26:30] opinion sometimes I feel we can be any
[1:26:33] of those three at any given
[1:26:36] time I believe that a Holy Ghost Field
[1:26:38] son and daughter of God can have hiccups
[1:26:40] in their life that makes them question
[1:26:42] who they
[1:26:42] are they they're like man really do I
[1:26:45] have it or do I don't I can't believe I
[1:26:47] did that you know does does that make
[1:26:50] him a make no you know they're they're
[1:26:52] not even believing who they are the
[1:26:54] Bible says who you are so if you're not
[1:26:56] believing who you are then you're
[1:26:58] unbelieving because you're a son and
[1:26:59] daughter of God you're the Bride of
[1:27:00] Jesus Christ there's no saved today and
[1:27:03] not
[1:27:04] tomorrow okay I mean it's plain and
[1:27:06] simple so sometimes you go around and
[1:27:08] that other times you're like yep I know
[1:27:11] he'll Heal Me yep he'll heal me he said
[1:27:13] he would and and honestly you're a make
[1:27:16] believer because in the M back of your
[1:27:18] head you're saying well he just don't
[1:27:20] want to heal me I'm stuck with this this
[1:27:24] is
[1:27:24] my Paul's whatever they called Paul's
[1:27:27] thing in his side this is this is my
[1:27:29] thing this is this is that no no that's
[1:27:31] not what he
[1:27:32] said he said by my
[1:27:35] stripes you're
[1:27:38] healed plain and simple we don't have to
[1:27:43] stay with it we don't have to keep it I
[1:27:47] don't have to stay blind in my eye
[1:27:49] everybody told me you're blind in that
[1:27:51] eye just so you wouldn't wouldn't join
[1:27:52] the Marines everybody knew if I had two
[1:27:54] good eyes I'd would join the Marines
[1:27:56] plain simple dad says I'd be a truck
[1:27:57] driver everybody else swears I'd join
[1:27:59] the Marine so probably i' have been a
[1:28:00] truck driver in the
[1:28:02] Marines so they say you lost your eye so
[1:28:07] you wouldn't join the Marines yeah
[1:28:09] that's what they say okay I I'll take
[1:28:11] that right because everything's ordered
[1:28:14] of the Lord everything's going the way
[1:28:16] it's supposed to go every evil thing is
[1:28:18] for your good that's what he said I
[1:28:21] mean
[1:28:22] all right so well I'm too old to join
[1:28:25] Marines now I mean you minimum of age is
[1:28:27] what 45 that's even to join the reserves
[1:28:30] right so I'm 45 now so that's out well
[1:28:33] that truck driver uhuh she'd kill me so
[1:28:35] that's
[1:28:37] out all right so if it was to keep me
[1:28:40] from being a marine it was to keep me
[1:28:42] from being a truck driver both of those
[1:28:44] are
[1:28:45] out right so if both of those are out
[1:28:49] then I can get my eyesight right well
[1:28:51] see that's a way way way roundabout way
[1:28:54] of looking at something that God gave me
[1:28:55] over 2,000 years
[1:29:01] ago all right God isn't going to heal me
[1:29:06] just because I can't do this no more or
[1:29:09] I can't do that no more or I'm too old
[1:29:11] for this now he he can heal me now
[1:29:13] because I won't run over here and do
[1:29:15] this he can take this away now because
[1:29:16] well I won't go over here
[1:29:19] no no he does it because he loves you he
[1:29:24] done it on the cross don't
[1:29:29] don't he deposited the money in your
[1:29:31] bank
[1:29:33] account the time leading up to and on
[1:29:36] the
[1:29:37] cross he took the beatings for your
[1:29:40] healing
[1:29:42] he even took it for your
[1:29:49] iniquities that is doing something wrong
[1:29:52] when you know better that's an
[1:29:57] iniquity and you say well brother you
[1:29:59] know comes a time you send away that day
[1:30:02] of Grace I I get that I I understand
[1:30:05] that and you know at one time I thought
[1:30:07] that's what I'd
[1:30:09] done but I'm living proof as long as
[1:30:12] there's breath in your body you can come
[1:30:14] to Jesus
[1:30:16] Christ I'm living proof of
[1:30:19] it
[1:30:20] yeah
[1:30:27] and I can
[1:30:29] laugh knowing where I came from knowing
[1:30:32] what I did knowing what I did to people
[1:30:36] knowing what I've had to make right
[1:30:38] knowing all of the things in my life
[1:30:41] that would make me one of the worst
[1:30:44] possible human beings on the
[1:30:48] planet but my God loved
[1:30:50] me and he put the money in the bank
[1:30:54] account and said' it's all right CU one
[1:30:57] day his wife's going to finally prove to
[1:31:00] him that Jesus Christ is real one of
[1:31:03] these days his wife's life is going to
[1:31:06] prove to him that God is real because
[1:31:10] you you can take it whatever laugh at me
[1:31:14] whatever you want to do if my wife
[1:31:16] hadn't been the Christian she was all
[1:31:19] those years I wouldn't be standing here
[1:31:23] that's the way I see
[1:31:24] it we got
[1:31:27] married told her and to be honest with
[1:31:30] you we decided to go to church and I
[1:31:32] told her I said well there's only one
[1:31:33] church I'll go
[1:31:35] to okay there's only one church that's
[1:31:37] got the truth but the honest the
[1:31:39] goodness truth is that I chose that
[1:31:41] church because I was pretty sure she
[1:31:42] wouldn't
[1:31:46] go that's the truth I said that because
[1:31:49] I was almost 100% sure she wouldn't give
[1:31:52] up our
[1:31:53] lifestyle to go back to that
[1:31:56] church and boy was I
[1:32:01] wrong she wasn't back to
[1:32:04] church two
[1:32:06] times no more shorts no more pants no
[1:32:10] more trimming the hair no more none of
[1:32:13] that stuff and I'm going what did I
[1:32:18] do but I couldn't say nothing because
[1:32:22] now I'd already said I'll only go to
[1:32:26] one you see the hand of God moving
[1:32:30] yet he used my own words against me you
[1:32:34] see because I knew there was a truth see
[1:32:36] I was like
[1:32:37] Sarah I knew there was a truth and I
[1:32:40] knew this message was the
[1:32:42] truth now mind you I thought just about
[1:32:45] everybody I ever met in it was a
[1:32:47] hypocrite but that's my own fault all
[1:32:51] right that well ain't the people's fault
[1:32:54] that ain't God's fault that's my
[1:32:56] fault okay so I I believed all that but
[1:33:01] I knew the message was the
[1:33:04] truth but I honestly believed there was
[1:33:07] no way God would take me after I went
[1:33:09] and did the stuff that I did when I was
[1:33:11] raised on the Pew of that
[1:33:15] church so I was like well all right so I
[1:33:18] went to church with her had my first
[1:33:20] experience with God
[1:33:23] I'll never forget it because I don't
[1:33:26] cry never have not really just don't you
[1:33:32] know I've got scars on my legs and stuff
[1:33:34] and I'm sitting there looking at it and
[1:33:36] I wrap it up and I'm like GP my teeth
[1:33:38] and I go on because you know I just you
[1:33:41] cried when I tell you don't know my
[1:33:45] friends or my old friends let a tear
[1:33:48] escape and they punch it off your cheek
[1:33:50] you know you just didn't didn't do it
[1:33:52] you just did not do it we weren't
[1:33:55] sissies that's what they called us if we
[1:33:57] cried but here I am in the church in
[1:33:59] front of all of my family because that's
[1:34:01] what the church was my whole family and
[1:34:03] everything David Syer just a preaching
[1:34:06] and I don't know what happened I ended
[1:34:08] up at the front of the church on my
[1:34:09] knees
[1:34:10] balling like you wouldn't
[1:34:13] believe that was my first
[1:34:16] experience it

[1:36:58] been a mess but they didn't they got
[1:37:02] there 10 minutes later and the place was
[1:37:04] fished blew their mind the guys at the
[1:37:06] church was actually mad they were like

[1:37:13] now we have
[1:37:17] to but anyways they would tell her they
[1:37:19] would call her a liar they would call
[1:37:20] her all their St because there ain't no
[1:37:22] way that I would do that stuff for her
[1:37:23] there ain't no way that I could be good
[1:37:25] to her and living the life that I was
[1:37:28] living now this was a message believing
[1:37:32] people right good people absolutely
[1:37:35] wonderful people I ain't saying nothing
[1:37:37] bad about them because the truth of the
[1:37:38] matter is I was horrible and they were
[1:37:39] just stating fact okay plain and simple
[1:37:43] it's the truth but she didn't listen to
[1:37:46] it she said you don't know my
[1:37:48] husband all right you don't know my John
[1:37:53] boy you don't know him because she
[1:37:56] wasn't looking to me as a
[1:38:00] drunk she wasn't looking at
[1:38:02] me all
[1:38:05] right she was looking at me as her
[1:38:08] husband she was looking at me as a
[1:38:11] Christian she was looking at me as the
[1:38:14] guy she wanted me to
[1:38:19] be and no I haven't got there yet she's
[1:38:22] got expectation of
[1:38:24] you but I'm working on
[1:38:27] it God's working on
[1:38:29] it and that's the way God looks at you
[1:38:32] yeah he doesn't
[1:38:35] see he doesn't see the
[1:38:39] pit when Joseph was throw in the pit God
[1:38:43] didn't see the pit God saw him at the
[1:38:46] right hand of pharaoh
[1:38:49] right when he was in Piper's house God
[1:38:52] didn't see the woman trying to do all
[1:38:54] that kind of stuff he knew it was going
[1:38:55] to happen and he even knew the choices
[1:38:56] that we were going to make but that
[1:38:58] ain't the way he looks at you he looks
[1:39:01] at you as the finished product of his
[1:39:05] work it's

[2:03:33] him sister keys and and Austin and Dylan
[2:03:36] will be making their way back uh from
[2:03:39] Coletta
[2:03:40] tomorrow and um so we want to keep them
[2:03:43] in our
[2:03:44] prayers and um we um
[2:03:50] uh are are uh really thankful for what
[2:03:53] the Lord done for sister Angie on her on
[2:03:56] her car and and that's just
[2:04:00] wonderful and
[2:04:03] um and we're just believing the Lord's
[2:04:05] going to take care of all of the rest of
[2:04:07] that too and and um help with that
[2:04:10] transmission our God is more than able
[2:04:15] Amen to do exceedingly abundant
[2:04:19] above all that we could even think
[2:04:23] amen we want to keep always keep every
[2:04:27] every service I think we should probably
[2:04:29] bring it up um but um and then pray
[2:04:32] every day but uh Ron Spencer uh keep
[2:04:36] brother Ron in our prayer he's um he
[2:04:39] battles every day of his life uh to live
[2:04:41] but he still he's still preaching the
[2:04:44] gospel and um
[2:04:47] uh Dr doctors doctors have said he's
[2:04:50] just not even in the one
[2:04:51] percentile uh he's he's he's he's so low
[2:04:55] down that he shouldn't even be alive
[2:04:58] they'd only gave him a they gave him a
[2:05:00] three-month
[2:05:02] um
[2:05:05] death uh warrant and and um he's he's
[2:05:09] been he's been living now for four
[2:05:12] years preaching the gospel winning many
[2:05:16] Souls traveling around the world
[2:05:19] amen they said he shouldn't even be able
[2:05:21] to be
[2:05:23] cognitive and um but yet the power of
[2:05:27] the Lord is with him and and so we're
[2:05:30] thankful for that he is um
[2:05:34] um but he's he's got he's got cancer all
[2:05:37] in his
[2:05:39] lungs he's got uh three big cancers in
[2:05:43] his brain he's got uh um the Lord has
[2:05:49] touched down in his
[2:05:51] organs and uh so we're just we're just
[2:05:53] believing the Lord for the lungs
[2:05:54] believing the Lord for his brain and um
[2:05:58] he's got he's got three three good siiz
[2:06:01] tumors in his head and um they can't
[2:06:05] operate on
[2:06:06] it and it's it's it's
[2:06:09] cancer and it's the it's the stuff that
[2:06:11] kills you but the Lord has kept him and
[2:06:15] so I'm just believing the Lord to for
[2:06:19] for that miracle and and so let's keep
[2:06:22] him in our prayers Donnie
[2:06:25] Reagan's daughter Erica is struggling
[2:06:29] for her life and we need a miracle for
[2:06:32] sister Erica and so I want us to all be
[2:06:37] be in prayer for her it's it's just
[2:06:40] quite a strain on the family her family
[2:06:44] she's got um children of her own a
[2:06:48] husband
[2:06:49] and um so let's let's let's just always
[2:06:53] keep um our our sister Erica in in in
[2:06:57] her prayer and um listen there's no
[2:07:02] there's there's there's no hope outside
[2:07:06] of Christ in both of these
[2:07:08] situations there's nothing the doctors
[2:07:10] can do and um and so they're doing the
[2:07:14] best they can trying
[2:07:16] to help you know keep things at Bay but
[2:07:20] we need we need God and so uh when you
[2:07:23] pray you
[2:07:26] know God's allowed these things to
[2:07:30] happen amen as brother John was saying
[2:07:32] tonight if there wasn't no sickness we
[2:07:34] wouldn't know him as a Healer and so we
[2:07:39] uh want to keep always keep those two in
[2:07:41] our prayers and we of course we don't
[2:07:43] bring it up all the time but that
[2:07:45] doesn't mean they're not fighting all
[2:07:46] the time they are fighting for their Liv
[2:07:48] lives and so pray for one another pray
[2:07:53] uh that
[2:07:55] there's there's healings that's been
[2:07:57] taking place and think God's been moving
[2:08:00] but we uh but we still need the Lord in
