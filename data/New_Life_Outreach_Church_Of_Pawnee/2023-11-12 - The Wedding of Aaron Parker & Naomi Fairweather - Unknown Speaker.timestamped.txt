[25:26] I
[25:32] you can be
[25:38] seated could we just bow our heads for a
[25:41] word of
[25:42] prayer father we're so thankful for your
[25:45] blessings we're so thankful Lord for
[25:48] what this day means and Lord of all the
[25:51] planning and Lord all of the work that
[25:54] has been put in to make this such a
[25:56] special occasion
[25:58] but Lord it would be nothing without you
[26:01] and we're asking Lord that you would be
[26:03] here on with every song with every word
[26:07] Lord with everything that is done and
[26:09] said we want your approval and your
[26:11] blessings we ask this Lord in your name
[26:15] amen and
[26:17] amen well I'd like to first begin by
[26:21] welcoming everyone and thanking everyone
[26:26] uh for being here on this most happy
[26:29] day and I know it's it's no accident
[26:32] that you are here today you're here
[26:36] because you represent someone important
[26:39] in the individual and the collective
[26:41] lives of eron and
[26:44] Naomi and seeing so many people that are
[26:48] that are here
[26:49] today I um I think Naomi and Aaron
[26:53] should be very thankful to have such
[26:56] wonderful support and
[26:58] friends you know outside of Salvation
[27:02] the most remarkable moment in life is
[27:05] when you meet that special person who
[27:08] makes you feel
[27:10] complete the person who makes the world
[27:14] a beautiful and magical
[27:17] place it's this person with whom you
[27:19] share a bond so special that it
[27:23] transcends all normal
[27:26] relationships
[27:28] and it becomes something so pure and so
[27:31] wonderful that you just can't imagine
[27:33] spending your life without the other
[27:36] person and that's why we're here today
[27:39] that's why Naomi and Aaron is
[27:42] here and yet marriage is perhaps the
[27:46] greatest and most challenging
[27:49] Adventures of all human
[27:52] relationships there's no ceremony that
[27:55] can create a strong and lasting marriage
[27:59] there's nothing here that I can say
[28:00] that's going to make your marriage
[28:03] last there's only one thing that can do
[28:07] that and that is through your commitment
[28:09] to God and your commitment one to the
[28:13] other a strong marriage comes through
[28:16] love and patience through dedication and
[28:22] perseverance a strong relationship comes
[28:24] from
[28:26] talking and
[28:28] listening and I want to say
[28:32] listening it's it's important that we
[28:36] listen a strong relationship comes from
[28:40] helping
[28:42] supporting
[28:44] believing in one
[28:48] another through tenderness and laughter
[28:51] through learning to forgive through
[28:54] learning to
[28:56] appreciate each of the differences in in
[28:58] one
[28:59] another and by learning to make the
[29:01] important things matter and to let the
[29:03] rest of it to
[29:05] go that makes a strong
[29:08] relationship there's going to be plenty
[29:10] of Trials and I I I am sure if we took a
[29:13] poll here today of of of all of the
[29:16] successful marriages that have been
[29:18] married for a long time there's been a
[29:21] few times where things didn't look too
[29:24] good but because of this commit ment
[29:27] that they made one day before God and
[29:31] before their
[29:32] friends their marriage has lasted and
[29:35] they're stronger today than they've ever
[29:38] been you see this ceremony is to make
[29:40] vows before
[29:42] God and before these Witnesses and to
[29:45] affirm that you've chosen to forsake all
[29:48] others and cling to one another as
[29:50] lifelong
[29:52] companions the scripture says for this
[29:54] cause a man shall leave his father and
[29:56] mother
[29:57] and shall cleave to his wife and they
[30:00] twain shall be one
[30:03] flesh it's quite obvious that the Lord
[30:05] God instituted marriage as an experience
[30:08] of love where Two Hearts Beat As
[30:12] One Elohim designed and instituted this
[30:16] Union as the only proper social order it
[30:19] is to provide that through well ordered
[30:21] families truth and
[30:24] Holiness might be transmitted from one
[30:26] generation ation to the
[30:28] next The Paton is going to be placed in
[30:31] your
[30:32] hands you're no longer under the
[30:34] authority of your
[30:36] parents as adults you're standing here
[30:39] today you're making lifelong
[30:42] decision that you and you alone will be
[30:45] responsible for your families your
[30:46] family raising your
[30:49] children it's the greatest thing it's
[30:51] the greatest honor it's the greatest
[30:55] responsibility I believe it's the
[30:57] greatest thing in the heartbeat of God
[31:00] Jesus when he performed his first
[31:01] miracle it was at a wedding the Apostle
[31:05] Paul through the divine revelation chose
[31:07] the symbol of husband and
[31:10] wife and the union that binds
[31:14] together he chose that to show the union
[31:18] between Christ himself and his blood
[31:20] bought ransomed
[31:22] bride what a wonderful wonderful thing
[31:25] this is today
[31:29] we are going
[31:30] to sing a song and I just want us to
[31:34] just bow our heads in prayer before we
[31:37] do
[31:39] father thinking of what I have just said
[31:42] and the blessedness of this
[31:46] relationship we're so
[31:48] thankful that you have
[31:51] chosen that you have ordained us and
[31:54] that you have given us lifelong
[31:56] companions
[31:58] and I'm asking God that you will bless
[32:00] this couple in the name of the Lord
[32:02] Jesus
[32:04] Christ amen and
[32:07] amen praise the
[32:26] Lord

[35:47] word that I will be
[35:50] yours as long as there are stars

[35:58] and as long as there are sins in the
[36:05] sea I promise that I will
[36:10] be ever
[36:16] faithful
[36:17] to
[36:22] you and as long as there are s in the
[36:29] sea I promise that I will
[36:35] be ever
[36:39] [Music]
[36:41] faithful
[36:42] to
[36:44] [Music]
[36:55] you
[37:21] the importance of starting the marriage
[37:24] off right doing it the way that God
[37:28] wants it
[37:29] done you see this is a blending of two
[37:33] individuals into one this is the
[37:36] blending of Hearts you're going to be
[37:38] two individuals you'll have two
[37:40] different opinions many of times but the
[37:43] goal it's a United goal it's a it's a
[37:47] it's a heart that beats us
[37:49] one and this Solomon sacred charge of
[37:53] this relationship should not be formed
[37:57] thoughtlessly
[37:59] irreverently but it should be formed
[38:01] advisedly and prayerfully and in the
[38:05] fear of
[38:06] God knowing that he God he is the Divine
[38:12] author he's the one who has ordained and
[38:14] blessed the
[38:16] marriage as Believers we know that we
[38:18] are in the presence in his presence and
[38:22] you will both answer someday when our
[38:25] hearts will be made manifest
[38:27] fast and the promise that you two make
[38:29] to one another will stand throughout
[38:33] eternity you see love is not an
[38:36] emotion love is the very core of your
[38:42] being we all wake up on the wrong side
[38:45] of the bed
[38:47] occasionally things go crazy and Haywire
[38:50] occasionally but love is not based on
[38:53] how we feel love is that something way
[38:56] down deep inside that God gave you for
[38:59] one
[39:00] another you see it's the sacred Act of
[39:03] God himself in The Binding of the two
[39:06] hearts together that no one else could
[39:08] ever share its beauty the only ones that
[39:12] can share this beauty of
[39:14] Love is you for
[39:16] her and you for him this is something
[39:20] that God has given you both just for one
[39:23] another you both must protect it
[39:27] and hold it
[39:28] sacred because happiness doesn't consist
[39:31] of how much of the world's good you own
[39:34] but how contented you are with the
[39:36] portions that you have been
[39:39] lotted now there's going to be times
[39:41] where you're not going to see things
[39:42] alike but you will always remember that
[39:45] you're still in love and sometimes we
[39:48] got to give in and say
[39:50] sorry and it and it's okay it's it's
[39:53] it's it's all right for a man to say
[39:55] sorry
[39:57] it's okay for a woman to say
[39:59] sorry it's okay to be able to stand
[40:02] there amen the prophet of God says
[40:06] there's a little bowl in a human heart
[40:08] that is full of golden oil called love
[40:11] he says if it's ever broken it can be
[40:13] healed but there will be a scar there as
[40:16] long as you live so let's start this
[40:18] thing off right let's love one another
[40:22] always
[40:23] amen now Aaron will you have this woman
[40:29] to be your wedded wife to live together
[40:32] after God's ordinances in the Holy
[40:34] estate of
[40:35] matrimony will you love her comfort her
[40:39] honor her keep her in sickness and in
[40:43] health forsaking all others and keep
[40:46] Naomi by your side as long as you both
[40:48] shall
[40:50] live Naomi will you have this man to be
[40:53] your wedded husband to live together
[40:56] after God's ordinance in the Holy estate
[40:58] of
[40:59] matrimony will you obey him and serve
[41:02] him and love and honor and keep him in
[41:04] sickness and in health forsaking all
[41:07] others and keep yourself only unto Aaron
[41:10] as long as you both shall live I
[41:14] do all right would you have your
[41:25] rings
[41:27] and what we'll have is you can just hand
[41:29] those to me there and then I'm going to
[41:30] have y'all to hold this Bible just like
[41:33] that and we're going to place these
[41:34] Rings right
[41:36] here and hopefully we won't drop any of
[41:39] them either
[41:40] amen you see these Rings here on this
[41:46] Bible you're making a covenant and our
[41:50] covenant the in the in the world today
[41:52] they've taken the Bible out of the
[41:55] courtrooms they've taken taking the
[41:56] Bible out of our public
[41:59] offices and we can
[42:02] see we can clearly see what is what has
[42:06] taken place in our country they removed
[42:09] the
[42:10] standard the standard is the foundation
[42:12] of this Bible That's the standard for
[42:15] marriage that's the standard that is
[42:16] holding those
[42:18] Rings If you do away with God's nature
[42:22] you do away with God's laws you've done
[42:25] away with God you've done away with your
[42:27] marriage you've done away with
[42:30] love love can only come from God and God
[42:34] has given us the foundation of his word
[42:37] and we must forever remember that of
[42:41] course the circle of a ring it
[42:44] symbolizes
[42:46] eternity you've chosen gold for your
[42:49] rings and it's it's a type of that which
[42:51] is least tarnished and most
[42:55] enduring these rings are to show how
[42:57] lasting and imperishable our faith is
[43:00] which is mutually
[43:02] pledged as the union now formed is to be
[43:05] separated only by death you both must
[43:09] truly understand and I want you to
[43:11] really Ponder the duties that you both
[43:14] assume as a believing couple marriage is
[43:17] not for the weak in
[43:19] faith marriage is for those who know
[43:23] Jesus and loves the Lord with all of
[43:26] their heart for only then can you truly
[43:29] love one
[43:31] another amen but I promise you through
[43:36] prayer you can and you will conquer any
[43:41] kind of a fold that'll
[43:43] come this union
[43:45] today is going to be a bond and if the
[43:49] Lord should Terry your family will
[43:52] become a great pillar in the house of
[43:54] the Lord and it's going to be because of
[43:57] this commitment that is made here
[44:00] today so Aaron it is the responsibility
[44:04] of the husband to shelter his bride from
[44:06] all
[44:08] danger and this is this protection is
[44:11] for physically and spiritually to
[44:14] provide for her every need it is your
[44:17] duty to cherish her and to give of
[44:20] yourself and to love her as Christ loved
[44:22] the church and gave himself for her now
[44:26] Naomi it is the
[44:27] responsibility of the wife to
[44:30] reverence and to trust and Obey her
[44:32] husband to put on the meek ornament of
[44:35] of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in
[44:38] God's side of great
[44:40] price now God's word commands that the
[44:44] wives be subject there's got to be a
[44:46] leader that doesn't mean that one's
[44:48] going to be lording over another that
[44:50] simply means there's got to be a
[44:52] provider there's got to be one that
[44:54] stands makes the decisions seeks the
[44:58] Lord and then there's got to be a team
[45:00] that says we're going to push toward the
[45:04] goal it's the privilege of both to
[45:06] Delight in the company of one another to
[45:09] be undivided in interest and affection
[45:12] seek God's will for your lives and work
[45:14] together in fulfilling God's your dreams
[45:18] and let each remember God's divine
[45:21] order in all things can you say Amen how
[45:26] many of the audience agrees with
[45:28] that
[45:30] amen now I tell you what I'm going to do
[45:33] I'm going to take the Bible from
[45:35] you and brother Aaron I want to let you
[45:38] take the Rings for sister Naomi we
[45:41] succeeded without dropping those Rings
[45:43] that's good you yes Place go ahead and
[45:46] place it right there on her ring finger
[45:54] there
