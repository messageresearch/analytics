thing brothers and sisters we're living in an hour that's more precious than any hour and God hand-picked you to live in this time what a privilege amen well I'm not trying to preach that tonight but it sure feels good amen hallelujah if you have your Bibles turned with me we're probably not seeing anything right at the moment but turn with me in your Bibles to the book of Galatians chapter 6. we'll begin reading verse 14. just want to thank brother Wendell I just was going to let him know that I was just come passing through and uh I hadn't been here in years and so I think I was last year around four years ago or so just uh for the meetings and I hadn't been here since and I just was heading towards kind of Northeast and just wanted to try to take a little bit of time and visit with with the Wendell and the rest of the folks here and we just appreciate the hospitality from Brother Wendell amen sister Fresco amen God bless you God bless the church amen I got to talk to a brother Jeremy about getting one about this size I I feel I feel good about that size amen amen it feels good to have enough space amen I've preached on some that was barely enough for my Bible and I preached and some that's this big so praise the Lord Galatians chapter six we just want to read this verse of scripture and hopefully there'll be something said here tonight that will bless your hearts I believe as the prophet said if you come expecting something that you will get what you expect and so I'm expecting a good time if you're expecting a good time you won't leave disappointed amen if you expect to find fault you will find it in this Texas boy even though I wasn't born in Texas I am I am from Texas so and that's okay it got quiet in here I can tell all right amen Galatians chapter 6 verse 14. it says but God forbid that I should Glory saving the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world it says for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature Hallelujah and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the Israel of God Hallelujah hope you know who where you are verse 17 says from henceforth let no man trouble me I believe Paul had to overcome some stuff there was a lot of things that were written about Paul that wasn't even true what I mean by that there was things spread around that wasn't even true about Paul but here he's saying here right here says henceforth let no man trouble me it says for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus brethren it says the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you and with your spirit amen amen how many has a need upon your heart tonight you just want the Lord to meet that need tonight amen let's just go to him in prayer most gracious Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege we have this evening Lord to come into this place God that's been set aside Lord for your presence and Lord that's truly what we're here for tonight Lord is just another touch from you God there's nothing like your touch Lord I pray tonight God that you just Minister Lord to these hearts Lord every every hungry soul that is here tonight God that you would just move Lord I believe everything out of the way father that you would speak your words of truth Lord to every life that Hearts would be drawn closer to you father we ask that your blessings will be upon each one Lord and that you just help me God to get out of the way that you could speak your words of truth and father we just love you for it and we praise you for it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated tonight amen and hope you don't mind I'm just going to get a little bit yes they say it's hard to fight when you're all bound up so we're just going to get rid of that tonight amen I'm going to read this quote brother Branham says this he says I think I want to paint this picture he says I think of what it will what it will be at that last supper and it's set there in glory it says and we've all overcome notice what he says we've all overcome and set across the table from one another he says I will look across the table and see these old battle scarred Saints sitting there tears of joy running down their cheeks he says we'll just have to reach across the table and take one another by the hand I want to put you there tonight for just a moment I want you to push the world out of the way and let's come into this Sanctuary here tonight I know you might be a little tired we'll not try to hold you too long but we want to hold you as long as the Lord wants but I want you to put yourself there for a moment he says and I will say oh brother I'm so glad to see it just think of that long supper table and then the king will come out in his Beauty in his beautiful garments and wipe all the tears from our eyes saying don't you cry no more we're all here now I love how he puts this he says it's all over the last prayer meetings is now done it says no more fasting no more praying we're all home now enter into the joys of the Lord he says that's what I want to hear that's what I'm working hard day and night all this time that I can do what is he trying to help us understand here brothers and sisters that that is a reality that that is coming brothers and sisters I've told the church back home I said that there when we get to the other side there's not going to be one vacant chair at that marriage supper not one and every chair I believe has reserved on it amen that you know brothers and sisters that's your name Hallelujah if it's if it's on the Lamb's Book of Life then you've got a chair at that marriage supper amen we're looking forward to that moment but we don't get there just by chance we don't get there brothers and sisters just happen to show up we've got to go through the trials of Life we've got to go through the scars of life and tonight I want to take this out of that first part that we read there and call this battle scarred Saints battle scarred Saints and I believe what Paul is putting out here and he talks about this in verse 17 it's from henceforth let no man trouble me it says for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus the marks these this word mark means it could be a cut on this in the surface or to to be uh to be punched or to also it shows the recognition of ownership I begin to think about that a recognition of ownership brothers and sisters we've been marked have you been marked do you have the token then you're Mark brothers and sisters and also it's talking about a scar of service it's this Mark and what about him continuously says when we reach across that table we see all these down there he says them old battles card veterans can you imagine what it's going to be like when we get on the other side brothers and sisters see each and every one sitting at that table and what a story we're going to have to tell amen we're going to have a story to tell it says in these battle scar veterans holding one another's hands weeping for Joy he says won't that be wonderful and he says oh I can hear announcement of silver in the blast of trumpet and out comes the king and his Beauty all this Majestic robe around how many walks along the table and he says and he'll take his own hand and wipe the tears out from our eyes and say don't cry now it's all over he says that's the day I'm living for yeah that's why I press and beg and plead for lost souls amen this is all that I that I know how to do to get them to the Lord Jesus he says then I want to I want to set down at his feet and hear him like these people did so I began to think about how what a time it must it's going to be brothers and sisters when we get over there but how many has ever heard of a veteran someone that's maybe been in the war or something that I begin to look this up just for information and I said how long do you have to be in there to be considered a veteran because I've seen some young guys as veterans I've seen Young when I say young they look young but I begin to look and I thought well they just look young they're called Veterans I always picture the veterans old guys look like me you know gray hair and missing hair or something one or two I'll begin to look this up says it says even in in the U.S 180 days of active duty not counting training or one day in a combat zone all right one day in the combat zone oh brothers and sisters I'm seeing battle scarred veterans here tonight how many here has been in the battle at least for one day I'm talking about the combat zone I'm talking about the place where you know those fiery darts are headed your direction if you've been there then brothers and sisters you may have scars you may have something brothers and sisters upon your spiritual body as it were showing proof that you've been in battle amen oh I begin to look at this and just begin to get excited one day Hallelujah in the battle I just love that I just love how God puts this but he he wants us to understand something he wants us to really look at this and see what a wound I want to kind of just differentiate a wound from a scar because a lot of times we have wounds and not scars yet now a wound is a wound is a rapid onset of injury that involves lacerations or a punctured skin and I begin to think there's a mighty difference between a wound and a scar if I was to ask you maybe here tonight something about something that happened in your life that caused a scar on your physical body you would go back to that moment that you were in and start reminiscing the things that took place that led up to that moment so I have a scar right now on my fist from plumbing plumbing it as as a plumber I was underneath the sink I'll go back to the story because I was a young man living at home just started in the plumbing career laying underneath the sink had a pair of channel locks on on us on a faucet and I grabbed a hold of it to turn and that thing slipped and this this part of my fist snagged something so sharp down there lacerated it was wide open they had to take a a butterfly bandage as it were to hold that thing back together I didn't go to the doctor we didn't hardly see doctors mom and dad just said hold it together let it let it let it heal up but I began to think about this now this is not a wound this is a scar a wound would be something that is still hurting a wound is something that is still has a potential to be opened so brothers and sisters my question tonight is is there wounds in your life that may still be there that when we begin to talk about this that it still hurts or is that has it healed enough where it's become a scar and it's okay brothers and sisters whether you're this one or that one but to know that if you give it time what has to happen that wound over time actually becomes a scar now you can look back at that and you're not as hurt as you used to be amen come on we can talk about these things because a scar is a mark That's remaining after the injured tissue was even healed hallelujah we're scarred brothers and sisters they're scars on us you've been through some stuff you fought some battles brothers and sisters you've had the hard times of your life where you didn't know if he was going to make it through as it were but it was by the grace of God that you came through at one more time that you had the breath that you could stand up and say I'm going on anyhow some way or another I'm Gonna Make It To Heaven what was that brothers and sisters now you're now you're looking at a scar now I'm looking back at the moments in my life where it felt like people begin to leave me but you know what I'm not no I'm no longer hurt over that amen why because now it's just a scar it's not a wound I believe we need to allow the great physician to come down and heal the wounds because we've all had them at some time in our life we've had something brothers and sisters that cut us so deep we thought we thought somehow or another we don't know if we're going to make that through that we've had those moments but what is that it's showing brothers and sisters each and every one of us are going to face tests but we need the great physician to do his work and what does he do he can take those wounds and he can turn them into scars why because he's gone see many and maybe have been wounded by another by someone's words question is have you let have you let him heal you okay what about his scars what about his scars what about his scars when I think about his scars when I think brothers and sisters about those nails and we can go to the Natural point and we could see I believe it hurt that body but what about when he began to cry out on that cross my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me why did he cry those out why because brothers and sisters he was taking on your sin and my sin that hurt brothers and sisters I want to tell you that hurt but he did it because he knew that there would be a bride that would come out of each and every single age that would overcome the oppression and the depression of the enemy he knew that each and every one of you would set foot on this Earth and begin to proclaim the good news of the Gospel oh brothers and sisters he knew that I want you to know you're on a battlefield the prophet said you're not on a picnic you're on a Battlefield if you woke up this morning expecting a picnic well did you hear the gunshots did you hear did you hear the Warfare going on the question is have you come through it brothers and sisters God has ordained you to come through these things the word through means to get through some to manage to deal with a difficult situation or to stay alive until it's over because I'm just going to look at you tonight and say stay alive look at someone say stay alive stay alive you might be in it you it feels so hot and heavy but stay alive if you're still alive you'll come through oh brothers and sisters we gotta we got to do everything that's within us to stay alive you're going to be in difficult situations you're going to have to go through those times and what has to happen brothers and sisters these trials and these tests come and you will either break down or you will break through which one are you going to be tonight are you the one is this a new life church a new life Outreach that will break through the struggle it'll break through every demonic power that comes this way what has to happen is there's got to be a seed of life down inside of your soul that says I will not fall listen and if I do so God will give me the strength to stand back up what has to happen there's got to be a whole makeup inside of your soul saying I'm going to break through not break down because the devil wants you to break down the devil wants you to sit at home and break down the devil wants you to sit in your chair or sit in your Pew and break down but God says I will have a bride that will break through [Music] I believe that with all my heart Hallelujah to get through it means that you will be able to do something to survive something if you're going through a hard time and someone tells you how many has ever heard this you'll get through this we've heard it and I believe people mean well if you really take what this means is you know what you're going to be an overcomer through this you what I mean you're going to get through this you're going to be you're going to come out on the other side and look back at this and recognize it was the grace of God that got you through see some of us may even wonder why do we have to go why does it feel like everything has to go wrong how has ever questioned that do we not serve the Living God does he not have control of the universe and then sometimes we say why am I going through this pain come on if you're human you probably had that thought once in your life I believe sometimes the simple thought of that is sometimes these difficult moments will bring you closer to God than the blessings will Amen in these hardships these moments in your life what does it begin to do it begins to make you get down on your knees and it begins to make you call out on God why because you need someone that's greater than your pain amen you need someone that's greater than your difficulties amen hallelujah I believe he'll do that trials drive us to our knees these knees of Prayer what we must do we must reach out we must call on the one that's able to bring order back to disorder amen how many how many knows he's able to do that amen if you really look at this he's wanting to give us peace he's wanting to give us joy I think what frustrates the devil the most is that he sends all of these trials and he sends all of these things in your life and you're still here he said I tried this and it didn't work come on I tried to get sister Sally I hope there's no Sally's in here tonight but I tried to get sister Sally against this one and I tried to get brother Joel against this one and I tried to get I'm just trying to help us understand what I was talking about we're trying to get this one against that one and that one and it's just not working they're still coming to church come on I've sold some Discord between this one and that one and still they're working it out and they're holding hands and they're still coming and worshiping in this place oh Hallelujah I like frustrating the devil don't you well that puts a smile on my face Hallelujah is it isn't life just amazed just think about just think about life for just a moment the power of life yeah we in construction you see a lot of things and and just thinking about this I've seen people run over these huge machines and trying to clear out areas and and then they'll put this dirt in and all these things but all it takes is one little seed to get mixed up in there somewhere and they'll put that oil on it they'll put the asphalt down and then all of a sudden guess what happens just give a little bit of time and the sun begins to shine down and it heats up that asphalt into warmth from the asphalt causes the reaction of that little seed down on underneath there that nobody can see at the moment you might be sitting in that service after service after service and it looks like sister Sally ain't getting it figured out come on chicks think about what I'm talking about and you'll see that but all of a sudden the sun begins to shine down and the devil loves to pave over you he loves to try to put this hard things on top of you but I'll tell you what it's amazing to me you'll just go out there one day and all of a sudden a little goody green thing huh because it's life it's life I've seen trees that grow up and as that tree gets out bigger and greater all of a sudden those roots spread out and it goes underneath sidewalks and it lifts up concrete what is that life the power of life I want to disturb the devil tonight I hope you do too that every battle that you put me through devil is just a scar hallelujah it's not even a wound anymore it's just a scar you know what that means brothers and sisters that I am proof that there's a living God you are proof that there's a living God tonight because if it was just not to me without him there would be no protruding through no asphalt but all because of that life all because of life that he gives you oh my think about it Hallelujah the Brown says this God no he knew this great Warfare was coming on between right and wrong he knew what the enemy was going to do he know just exactly how to equip his people so if we notice the first the very first thing that God equips his children him being infinite he knowed what to what to what it took to defeat Satan any time any place and anywhere on any condition oh he knew aren't you glad he knew aren't you glad he knew oh my I've got to keep reading I gotta calm down Hallelujah he says I'll give them something here and in a few few years later he says I may study out something better and give them he says no that's not the way it works he says like we the military we have we used to have old bow and arrows and then a celebrity and all these things he begins to say and a musket and then after the musket the Springfield and he says now Atomic weapons and things he says we keep growing more and more he says but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God now he's seeing there was going to be a conflict aren't you glad he knew there'd be a conflict he says and there was going to be a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of an attack and the right kind of everything that they they had need of and would sweep them all the way from Eden to the rapture Hallelujah brothers and sisters he's giving you something that is proven he's given you something that will make it through he says what is it he says it's the word he says that's what defeats Satan is the word it'll defeat him he says it again anywhere any place he says now why do you want to substitute something else when you've already got the best thing that there is and it's the word take that take that brothers and sisters can you imagine he's giving I don't know about you but if that van out there was coming my direction I see a van straight ahead I don't know whose band that is but don't worry about it if I had an option here tonight of an arsenal and I had a 45 caliber pistol or I had a bazooka what do you think I want to use the biggest thing I've got the best thing I've got yeah God has given us the best thing he's given us his word it's been tried it's been proven oh my all right I gotta hurry praise God we're going to be here wow I can tell don't get nervous let's read on let's read let's turn with me if you will to the Book of Luke I love what Jesus says here this is Jesus as he's going back to his hometown in Nazareth I want to read this Luke chapter 4. verse 16. it says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah it says and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written Verse 18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted now notice I love how he puts these all together and to it says to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he said right here as he stood up in the church and he began to read this the spirit of the Lord is upon me now they've looked at him as an illegitimate child is this not Joseph's son you can read on we don't get on all that but I want you to really now he's standing there and he's reading this he says I have been sent here hallelujah I've been anointed to preach that gospel I've been anointed if I can just help you help you understand to heal those that are brokenhearted I've been anointed to preach the Deliverance to the captives whole mind what is he and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears notice what he's saying here deliver I'm going to just pull out one of this portions right here Deliverance to the captives now if you've ever been in battle you maybe understand what I'm talking about sometimes in the battle people become captured not by Will Nobody by Will but it happens I'm going to say Amen to that y'all look this up and I'll just put in there just as a Naturals like how does this happen how do how do they become captives a captive is a prisoner of war that's what a captive is it's to capture to be taken taken for oneself and I looked it says the most common way to be captured is to get surrounded and then run out of ammunition think about that the most common way to be captured is to get surrounded and then run out of ammunition I'm beginning to think brothers and sisters what does the devil tried us to get us he begin to try to get us to separate he wants this church to separate we want this one to separate and he wants this one to separate in the church and that one to pull away because brothers and sisters there's a Unity when we come together as a body the devil begins to get nervous every time we come together with an intention to get closer to God the devil is on he's on the everybody be aware what's going on over here some go scope this out what is happening so what he tries to do is he tries to get people alienated or separated from one another if you get separated long enough most of the time that isolation causes you to run out of ammunition oh think about it so I begin to look this up how many years ever seen um the flag the POW flag it's actually a Black Flag if you remember what that looks like and it has a silhouette of a man and in the background it shows like a like a excuse me a guard Tower and then there's a little piece of barbed wire coming across as it were right down here I begin to look this up the POW flag which means a prisoner of war flag or M.I.A which means missing in action if you look at this it's also known that it consists of a silhouette which I just explained here but on the bottom it says you are not forgotten it appears in the very bottom of this flag now the U.S forces if you really think about this the U.S forces I'm trying to paint a picture here for just a moment the U.S forces in their dining Halls their mess halls and and in their with the places where they gather to eat it's they're on display in one part of this mess hall there's a table and a chair in a corner Drake with a p-o-w-m-i-a flag and there's a symbol for the missing thus reserving a chair in the hopes of their return it is flown by those that are home and are missing those soldiers I'm beginning to think about this as we come into the house of God I believe and I don't mean this in any disrespect we're in the dining hall tonight anybody here in the dining hall tonight now if I can paint you a picture here what they have in the corner is they have a let's think this is the flag they have that draped over that that table that chair and it represents that somebody is either missing an action or they've been a prisoner of war and they're waiting for their return yeah yeah and I begin to think about us sitting here tonight in the dining hall I believe we're sitting here tonight to dine but maybe there's somebody out there maybe you could raise your hand tonight and say I know that there's someone out there that I could raise and I could say I'm raising my flag for someone that's a pow or someone that's missing an action what does that mean brothers and sisters it's showing brothers and sisters that we believe that they'll return Hallelujah somewhere somehow amen only God can do this brothers and sisters but what does it do it's a reminder it is a reminder as we're sitting here tonight and we enjoy worshiping the Lord have we not enjoyed his presence already tonight on this Wednesday if we not enjoyed the worship we're enjoyed as we begin to enter into the word of God but some people don't in are not able to enjoy what we have enjoyed even at this evening and in my heart I said oh God give him a chance Lord there's got to be somebody that will remember these that may be may be missing in action I believe brother Brandon put it kind of like this when he talked about that eagle he says one time I was at that Cincinnati Zoo I was down there a little daughter and I were there he says I'm a great lover you probably know this story I just want to read it he says I'm a lover of the outdoors you know and I've seen they'd caught an eagle and they put him in a cage he said all that poor fella he said I heard a noise he said I was holding a little star by the hand we went down to the cage and there was this great big bird bloody all over his face feathers all beat off of him he's I thought oh what a pitiful sight he got down he walked back across the cage and he got a start and here he come flopping his wings again and burst his head up against the side of the cage flopping his wings up and down trying to get out of the cage and beating the feathers off but he was captured he fell back on the floor and laid there his eyes rolled around he looked up and seen the blue skies which he was born for I believe brothers and sisters and every True Believer there's a yearning for True freedom and you know what I mean by that I'm longing for those blue skies Hallelujah amen he says what he was born for he's a Heavenly bird you know he says but you see some wise achievement of man put him in a cage and I stood there looking at him I thought I'd give anything if I could buy him if I'd buy him I'd turn him loose I said go ahead go go ahead fella he says you'll like that he says I do too be free and go up there he says You Belong up there you're born for that I thought that was one of the most pitiful sights I've ever seen I picked up Sarah Helder in my arms and said honey there's one of the worst sights your eyes will ever look at and I stood there thinking I thought no I know a worse sight than that look up at the hill there the men with a can of beer in their hand women with the shorts and cigarettes he begin to tell them about this and he says that we're actually born to be Sons and Daughters of God he says in there in the cage of sin that Satan has put them in pitiful spiritually blind caged up he says maybe you belong to some church or maybe even sing in a choir yet caged in sin brothers and sisters I want to tell you tonight if you're in that cage there's the Liberator here tonight if you're in that place if the devil has pulled you down into just a deep pressed state in your mind brothers and sisters I believe there's a God here tonight that is able to set those captives free because he said he said listen he again said it the spirit of the Lord is upon me Amen to what set these captives free oh Hallelujah I believe that with all my heart amen what is that Deliverance it's Freedom it's pardon it's forgiveness how many of you just come to church and just needed God's forgiveness Liberty how many just loves to have the liberty of God where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty oh brothers and sisters that's why I love coming to the house of God amen oh hallelujah what is it he wants he wants to give you he wants to give you such a peaceful moment in your life you remember that story brother Byron talks about I'll just paraphrase it he began to talk about that that captain of of Rome I believe it was Caesar and he's he said he said he wanted someone to sit by his side you remember the story probably and he said all these officers begin to shine up their armor and their plumes all these things trying to make ready because they wanted to be with Caesar and as he's going through the crowds and he sees all these that are dressed and they're shiny but he looks over and he sees one man it's all scarred up and he looks at him and says where'd you get those scars he said I got him on the battlefield for my Lord he said won't you come up here and ride with me brothers and sisters I believe he wants you to climb aboard and ride with him tonight how much ever just had the mercy of God just wrap his Mercy right around you as you just you felt his Mercy in his love brothers and sisters those are the those are the kind of things he's looking for true soldiers and I believe soldiers can be young people amen soldiers can be young men and young ladies amen what is that pressing the battle Hallelujah pushing forward brothers and sisters this is not an hour that we should be slacked this is the hour that we should be putting everything we have into serving the lord everything that's within US soldiers arise amen soldiers come to combat amen soldiers come on it's time that we press the battle I don't like going in Retreat brothers and sisters I like moving forward I like seeing the backside of the enemy amen what does that mean that they're on the Run oh Hallelujah you're a soldier ain't you you're a soldier ain't you oh my Hallelujah I believe we're soldiers I'm going to just read this right quick first John chapter 5 verse 4 and 5. I need to Define what time it is all right it says for whatsoever first John 5 verses 4 4 whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world my I could just stop with that one I think that just seals the whole thing up right there for whatsoever is born of God if you know where you've been born Church it overcoming the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God do you believe brothers and sisters do you know where you've been born do you know that you're alive do you know that you're pressing the battle oh Hallelujah I'll quote this one you know what Isaiah 54 verse 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that rise against thee in judgment shall it says Thou shalt condemn if I could paint the picture tonight of and I just want to paint the picture of the old days when they would take and they would take steel and they would begin to go in the forgeries if you think in the Smith the smithies I believe and they would go in there and they begin to heat up this steel and they'd begin to pound on it and try to and get it uh red hot so that they could flatten it out so they could use these things for weapons and they would begin to form out Spears and and they would begin to form out swords and and shield all these things that begin to make all these weapons and if I could just paint the picture tonight as we would walk through uh if I could put it this way the Gates of Hell tonight and we could see the smithies and we could see the forgeries and we could see all these things and there's people beating them and they're they're forming an all this lined up as soon as this one gets done with this one they stack them up and here they are lined up weapons weapons that the devil wants to try to use against the bride of Christ if you really think about this even the Bible says that he which is gone created the Smith and bloweth the coals of in the fire but listen I want you to understand no matter how many spheres are made no matter how many swords have been made I begin to look at just you really look at things and most most things you'll look in the fine print you'll find something on there it says made in China most a lot of things right a lot of things it's made here maybe maybe it said maybe made in the U.S but there's little inscriptions right that's something on the bottom I believe that every sword that is made every spear that is made everything that the devil tries and he begins I'll just put this he he creates this great thing of sin he creates this sword of guilt and he he creates these things of depression and falsehood but at the little description before it can be even sent out and given to these demons there's an inscription on the bottom of it says it shall not prosper if you look at the very thing the devil has tried to use against you and you turn around say hey Neville read the fine print what does it say it says it shall not prosper every depression spirit that comes my direction every air that comes my way brothers and sisters I can tell the devil that it shall not prosper not because of what I've said or what I've done but God said it God said before it leaves the Gates of Hell before it leaves the forgeries and the smithies brothers and sisters there shall be an inscription on it and that inscription is going to say it shall not the next time brothers and sisters something comes your direction you turn it around when doubt comes to you comes your way look at him right in the face and say it shall not press fear will come and try to grab a halt of you brothers and sisters but you look him right back in the face and say it shall not prosper amen whatever it is you put that name whatever it is that the Devils try to send your direction you put that name right there and you tell them to look at the bottom look at the inscription Hallelujah I hope you never read that scripture the same way it shall not prosper it will not Prosper no matter what it is Satan you're defeated amen oh he may try to get as big and ugly as he possibly can but it shall not oppress oh my how many times has he come in listen like a roaring lion how many times does he try to get you deceive you pull you down speak some ugly word in your ear that nobody even spoke but he told you somebody did look back at that devil say it shall not Prosper it ain't gonna work oh my because my God said write it down and he's got all power write it down like I said it can't leave till it has that inscription on there amen oh brother and sisters but but see I like the church it has to pass through that Hall of critics we've had to go through it come on he says you're going to be called a Holy Roller you're going to be called everything he says but if you could only hold your position in Christ oh brother and sister we just preached at home and talking about your position oh my let's let's find our position tonight oh brothers and sisters when people get in their position I'm trying not to preach on that but it sure burning when we get in position brothers and sisters you'll be amazed I'll how smoothly things will go and what I mean by that is how things will work together I didn't say that the battles wouldn't be there yeah but what happens is when this begins to happen all of a sudden Things fall into place why because this one's in their position and this one's holding the line there you go why do you think it's so important that each and every well you may say well I don't really do much all right don't let the devil tell you that yeah Oh my he says get in your positions hold your positions he says someday he'll take us take us to the Hall of Fame but first we've got to stand the criticism there's where the littleness of us stand it says there's where it shows it says that he cannot stand he that cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child and not a child of God no matter how much he's joined the church or whatever he's done if he cannot stand chastisement he's an illegitimate and he's not a real child of God but a real genuine child of God don't care what the world says everything else is secondary he's got his mind on Christ and that settles it whatever Christ says whatever he says oh brothers and sisters do you know what he says tonight do you do you recognize his voice I believe the Bible says that my sheep know my voice amen they know my voice amen I'm going to close with this how many here's ever seen a golf ball I know brother Merle has anybody else seen a golf ball you know okay that could be in different colors or whatever but yeah yeah just I thought this was very interesting originally he said what does this have to do with Battle Scars you'll get it here in just a minute originally golf balls were smooth as golfers use the same ball over and over they started to notice I love this that the more beat up golf balls were traveling farther the Knicks the bumps the slices were actually helping them win in other words when they first began to hit these balls they were smooth and as they hit them and they hit them and they reused they begin to put little dents in the little Parts into this into this ball and they they recognize that these bumps and these Nicks and all these things were actually now the ball was starting to go further than it had been going before eventually putting Impressions on the golf balls became a standard after being proved aerodynamically accurate by a physicist that says of course it says here's the deal I just thought this was good the dimples in the golf balls create turbulence anybody oh but yeah I didn't want to hear that tonight yeah I didn't drive all the way here all day to to hear tonight that turbulence is a great thing that's what you got what does he say here that this turbulence which means a turbulence is that means mixed airflow that means things are going this way and that way and this way and that way how many has ever been there how many has ever woke up in turbulence how many amen you woke up on a Monday morning in turbulence you woke up on a Saturday morning in turbulence you've had those moments what it happens brothers and sisters if you recognize it reduces drag when this is done right these little Impressions that are put into this ball it reduces the drag making it go farther not only that oh I love this one it creates lift I'm just giving you a second it creates lift without that you couldn't have lift or flight it says a golf ball without dimples it says that cannot have fly that way it'll he'll hit it and you'll get it to certain far but it's not going to go as far as they have designed so a ball without dimples won't fly half as far as a ball with dimples according to the USGA researchers today I begin to look at this up because I was interested and it says that most golf balls have anywhere from 336 to 500 dimples with an ideal range between 380 to 432 dimples per golf ball how does that have anything to do with me so I said this if our if an average body was covered with these dimples using the number 400 on a golf ball it would have an approximately 572 000 dimples on your body so I kind of broke this down if you had 16 trials every day nobody's asking nobody's hands are raised Lord pick me no no if you had 16 trials every day and I put this I just put this for 16 I just put this like every every hour that you're awake you would have to live approximately 198 or excuse me you'd have to live almost 98 years old to accumulate 572 000 trials so my question is if a ball can go further because of its design and they just figured this out however I mean ghosts oh but it ain't that old if they could design it to where now it can travel farther What About Us think about this every time that next trial comes your way that next battle comes your direction it's a scar but what is it doing it's making you get a little higher and go a little bit further every trial every battle when you get if you go into battle Tomorrow there's something that comes your direction you say there's another one I'm just getting a little higher brother window and I'm going a little bit further because I'll tell you this our lord Jesus knows just how to get that ball where it needs to go Hallelujah amen I don't tell you what I don't know how I'm a terrible golfer I'll just tell you that I hit the ball like this and it goes like that and I don't don't understand it one bit and I've practiced and practiced and I still ain't no good well I'll tell you what when someone's done it over and over and over they know exactly what to do oh my brothers and sisters I believe he's got some battle scarred Saints here tonight we'll close with this but the RAM says now we're expected to be tested hahaha how many of us have walked there said why Lord I got another test he says we're expected to be tested yeah he says that's a good lesson from my brother back there he says oh he says there were in the time of Daniel's time there were four Overcomers that could stand the test of the fire and the lion see now God has called you to be tested tested what with the word it says that's God's test do you believe it do you believe it so you tested right here do you believe it he said that only shows a true child then see to be tested and when the test comes on he says you can't you can't overcome lest there's a test to get that that's given to you and when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not Jesus said to him that overcometh the test he says the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you boy that that's something I think sometimes we need to remind ourselves that he says I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's testing time it's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested see we're for all children of God are tested and tried so the next time you face a trial and next time you face a battle brothers and sisters I want you to think of it differently because we all face trials young people face trials come on they're going through hard transitions in their life trying to figure things out it's hard for them but I'll tell you what God wouldn't put more on them than they could bear he said I will be your help and I will be your strength you want some you want someone that's even listen that's greater than the one sitting next to you I'll tell you what rely on him because when all men fail God will not fail amen hold to him that next trial that you got to go through you I'm telling you tonight I believe the Lord just laid this on my heart just for just for here just saying there's some battle scarred Saints here but I'll tell you this brother Wendell when I get to the other side and we're sitting at that table that's thousands of miles long I'm going to see some of you across the table scarred veterans you may have been in it for a day you may have been in it for a week you may have been in it for 20 years but brothers and sisters press the battle move forward don't don't turn around and run run towards the end I love the example and I'm done none of this is on here I just so musicians can come on up here as I'm testifying now Hallelujah I love the story that as as it's wrote in Samuel about David how did he recognizes he has this conversation with Goliath and then after this conversation and he has those five Stones it says that he runs towards him can you imagine what's going through the the Giant's mind Goliath's mind is he's looking at this little little Ruddy boy with a fire in his eyes oh brother sister think about this and he's running straight at you and he's reaching in his pocket he pulls out this Stone and he grabs this thing I don't know about you but who takes a rock to a sword fight God's people amen God's people the devil looks at you and says listen what do you think I am you come to me with staves and listen sticks I'm not out here I'm not out here to play games that's what goliath was telling him but what did he do he ran straight at him I love it how he takes that and he throws that he did his part now it's in the hands of God to do the rest can I ask you this tonight will you do your part will you do your part tonight Inspire hits for just a moment [Music] is there something you have need of tonight maybe you've been fighting some battles maybe you've been struggling maybe you have been in that mode of saying Lord I don't understand I have to face this is why the struggle seems to get harder I pray tonight that you will recognize he is with you with you in all of these things there's not one battle listen he will not he will not let a battle come your way unless he already knows that you are able to overcome it if you will just rely on him will you give him that tonight say Lord I'm putting my trust in you through I've tried to trust this thing and that thing I've tried to trust things in my life but tonight Lord I'm trusting you I'm going to put my full confidence in you just [Music] maybe you have a wound tonight maybe there's something that's still hurting maybe there's a something that's still through as it were it's still open tonight the great position to come by and you need him to heal that wound the trust in God that you can move forward that you can have that testimony that he's calling you to have each and every one of us are facing things brothers and sisters that maybe we thought we would never have to face but God will use those things he will use them he will bless you he's wanting to show you like he's we just read he wants to put you in that Hall of Fame he wants you tonight to recognize you're going through that Hall of critics because you fix it to be moved to that Hall of Fame oh he's coming Church he's coming for that Brian without a smaller wrinkle or any blemish won't there be one here tonight I said Lord I need I need Just Another Touch from you I need something Lord Jesus tonight God will give me the strength to move forward I want to overcome like you call me overcome we just read it Lord that we are Overcomers why because we're born of you take that Shield of Faith tonight hold that Shield up no tonight when you walk out of this
