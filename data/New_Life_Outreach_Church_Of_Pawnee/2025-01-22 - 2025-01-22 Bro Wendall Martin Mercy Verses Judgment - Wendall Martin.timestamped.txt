[18:25] thankful for that good to see everyone
[18:27] here tonight and
[18:29] and um here on a Wednesday night and we
[18:33] just say God bless you and um good to
[18:37] good to see uh brother Aaron over there
[18:39] on the drums and and uh
[18:46] we appreciate him and learning the drums
[18:50] and uh so I'm just so excited uh for
[18:53] that and I think I think he's doing
[18:56] pretty good amen
[19:00] it's good to see
[19:02] everyone let's look here in the Book of
[19:04] Romans I um uh I was going to start the
[19:09] um the get back on the church ages
[19:13] tonight and um um and and I've had a
[19:18] sister that has been ready for those
[19:20] Church ages and and um and she's not
[19:24] here she's in the hospital and and so I
[19:28] thought
[19:29] um that I would I would wait until
[19:31] Denise gets out we'll start it next week
[19:33] so whether she's in or out amen we'll
[19:36] we'll start it again next week but um
[19:38] but we are going to um Minister along
[19:42] the lines is is what we're fixing to go
[19:45] into in the church ages is the is um the
[19:48] two judgments and um so I thought that I
[19:52] would Minister here tonight amen uh and
[19:56] just title it Mercy versus judgment J
[19:59] and um so let's look here in the Book of
[20:01] Romans 1
[20:04] and6 for I am not ashamed of the gospel
[20:08] of Christ for it is the power of God un
[20:13] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[20:16] the Jew first and also to the Greek for
[20:20] therein is the righteousness of God
[20:24] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[20:28] written the just shall live by faith for
[20:30] the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
[20:33] against all
[20:34] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[20:37] who hold the truth in
[20:40] unrighteousness now this is incredible
[20:42] holding the truth in
[20:44] unrighteousness because that which may
[20:47] be known of God is Manifest in them for
[20:50] God has shown it unto
[20:52] them for uh the invisible things of him
[20:56] from the creation of the world is
[20:58] clearly seeing being
[21:00] understood by things that are made even
[21:03] his eternal power and godhead so they
[21:05] are without
[21:06] excuse because that when they knew God
[21:09] they glorified him not as God neither
[21:11] were thankful but became vain in their
[21:14] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[21:17] darkened professing themselves to be
[21:19] wise they become fools and changed the
[21:23] glory of The Incorruptible God into an
[21:26] image made like to corruptible man to
[21:29] birds and four-footed Beast and creeping
[21:32] things wherefore God also gave them up
[21:35] to uncleanness through the lust of their
[21:37] own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[21:40] between themselves who changed the truth
[21:43] of God into a lie and worshiped and
[21:47] served the creature more than the
[21:50] Creator who is blessed forever and amen
[21:55] let's go to the Lord in prayer father we
[21:58] are so thankful to you tonight for the
[22:01] blood of Jesus we're so thankful for
[22:05] Mercy Lord we're thankful that we can
[22:08] gather together and we can worship you
[22:12] we can love you Lord and not worshiping
[22:15] a a dead Idol but Lord is I heard
[22:19] brother murl praying and wanting your
[22:22] presence to be among us father that's
[22:26] the desire of every one of us we want
[22:29] your presence to ever be with us Lord
[22:32] the Living God and Father we ask that
[22:35] you would just come now as we have read
[22:38] your word and that you would help me
[22:41] Lord as to say only as you would direct
[22:45] Lord and may you just bring our hearts
[22:47] and teach us Lord what you want us to
[22:49] know and we'll give you glory and honor
[22:52] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[22:55] the church say amen amen and amen God
[22:58] bless you you may be seated if you still
[23:01] have your Bibles open I would like to
[23:04] continue to read now we just we just
[23:07] read that the I'm not ashamed of the
[23:10] Gospel there in 16 and 17 for it is the
[23:13] power of God under
[23:15] salvation and then we read from 18 down
[23:19] to the 23rd how that they've changed
[23:22] things they've known God they've known
[23:24] the ways of God they they were without
[23:27] excuse
[23:29] but yet they've chosen uh the creature
[23:32] over the
[23:34] Creator and then we see there in the
[23:37] 24th verse where where he where the
[23:40] Apostle Paul says now God has given them
[23:44] over to a repeate
[23:46] mind and and so we want to continue on
[23:49] in this 26th verse for this cause God
[23:52] gave them up unto vile
[23:55] affections for even their women did
[23:58] change change the natural use into that
[24:01] which is against nature likewise also
[24:04] the men leaving the natural use of the
[24:06] woman burned in their lust one toward
[24:10] another men with men working that which
[24:14] is unseemly and receiving in themselves
[24:17] that recompense of their error which was
[24:20] meat and even as they did not like to
[24:23] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[24:25] them over to a repeate mind to do those
[24:28] things things which are convenient being
[24:29] filled with unrighteousness fornication
[24:33] wickedness covetousness malice
[24:37] maliciousness full of Envy murder debate
[24:40] deceit malignity Whispers backbiters
[24:45] haters of God despiteful proud boasters
[24:49] inventors of evil things disobedient to
[24:52] Parents Without understanding coven uh
[24:56] Covenant Breakers without natural
[24:58] affection implacable and
[25:01] merciful who knowing the Judgment of God
[25:05] that they which commit such things are
[25:07] worthy of death and not only do the same
[25:10] but have pleasure in them that do them
[25:15] now
[25:16] I got to thinking as I um listening to
[25:22] uh
[25:23] watching um a few things on the
[25:26] inauguration and and and um um there was
[25:31] a woman Bishop how how many heard that
[25:33] woman Bishop um you know and um
[25:40] reprimanding you know she was she was
[25:43] talking her whole sermon was to the
[25:45] President and Vice
[25:47] President and uh speaking on unity and
[25:50] praying for Unity and and um you know
[25:54] and her Unity is the community across
[25:57] diversity and Division and teaching to
[26:00] hold uh multiple
[26:03] perspectives and life experiences as
[26:06] valid and worthy of
[26:08] respect and she admonished president
[26:11] Trump in the name of God she's as
[26:14] Presbyterian Bishop she's never she
[26:16] never as everything I heard never used
[26:19] invoked the name Jesus but she was
[26:23] instructing him and pleading with him to
[26:25] be merciful to the gays and the lesbians
[26:28] and the transgender children and they're
[26:31] fearing for their lives and and she just
[26:34] goes on and on and on and on
[26:37] and
[26:40] and first of all thinking of the
[26:42] Blasphemous behavior of any kind of a
[26:46] preacher that would have an opportunity
[26:50] to use this as a national
[26:53] International um platform to to to to
[26:57] preach the word
[26:59] and let alone she she was out of her
[27:02] place in the first place she is the
[27:05] Apostle Paul says in Timothy I suffer
[27:07] not a woman to teach nor usurp authority
[27:10] over a
[27:11] man but she is commanded to be in
[27:13] silence and under
[27:15] subjection but we as we as we begin to
[27:19] think about this and I as we are in the
[27:23] church age book and and we're looking at
[27:25] the judgments and we're seeing as we're
[27:28] fixing to get into the two judgments
[27:30] that there are there is a judgment that
[27:33] happens here on
[27:35] Earth and then there will be a judgment
[27:38] that'll take place the white Throne
[27:40] judgment that'll take place a thousand
[27:42] years after the Rapture so there are two
[27:46] judgments that are taking that that are
[27:48] going to take place and the word is the
[27:53] very thing that is to judge us now so
[27:56] the believer will will never stand as
[28:00] the bride of Christ we will never stand
[28:03] uh uh before the Judgment seat of that
[28:06] white Throne judgment but we are being
[28:09] judged right now with the
[28:13] scriptures now it's important don't you
[28:17] think that that's important to let
[28:19] people know where they
[28:21] are it it's it's important you see we
[28:25] don't want to blend in we we want to be
[28:27] respectful of all people we want to love
[28:30] all people we we we we definitely don't
[28:34] wish harm I I seen somebody on the on
[28:37] the on the U the prayer page the other
[28:40] day uh saying praying for for uh all of
[28:43] those there in California of course
[28:46] we're praying for those because those
[28:48] are real genuine people they're they're
[28:51] genuine people they've lost lives
[28:54] they've lost they've lost homes but yet
[28:58] we know they're under
[29:00] judgment and we know that sin is is
[29:04] bringing the judgments on the earth and
[29:08] yet it should behoove you and I the
[29:12] responsibility of me and you amen you
[29:15] and me uh to to get it right and to and
[29:21] and to be a voice of Mercy to this dying
[29:26] generation how are you going to a voice
[29:28] of Mercy tell them the truth of God's
[29:32] word now now how many of you children
[29:35] just just read are just understood for
[29:37] those of you that that you know you a
[29:40] lot of us here we know that there's
[29:42] lesbians and you know girls liking girls
[29:45] and boys liking boys and and and and
[29:48] there's all of these transgenders things
[29:49] now did y'all just read here in the
[29:51] Bible that I when I just read this to
[29:53] y'all did y'all hear what God said about
[29:55] it did did you all hear that now is that
[29:58] is that Bible that that's Bible and yet
[30:02] that
[30:04] preacher who shouldn't even she has no
[30:07] right to be there in the first place but
[30:10] there she takes her International
[30:13] audience and instead of standing pres
[30:18] president I listen I I am not here to
[30:20] defend any politician let them do what
[30:23] they're going to do but I will say that
[30:25] President Trump did say the day before
[30:28] or we're going to get back to where
[30:30] there's only two genders a male and a
[30:33] female what what well that's
[30:40] Bible done
[30:41] it he made he made those things we we're
[30:45] not going to be butchering our children
[30:47] anymore if I have my way we're going to
[30:49] make sure that we're going to protect
[30:51] and yet she is coming in and and and
[30:54] instead she's taking the side of sin
[31:00] all in the name of
[31:04] mercy be
[31:06] merciful now
[31:09] I want you to look here in in Ezekiel 3
[31:13] And1 17 and and if you want to turn
[31:16] there go ahead and turn there because I
[31:18] I want you kids to see this as well uh I
[31:20] I've got it marked uh in in and and I
[31:24] think it's I think it's very important
[31:26] Ezekiel 3 and
[31:29] 17 and I I I I believe our as the Bride
[31:32] of Jesus Christ We Are The Watchmen we
[31:35] we are God's voice how many believes
[31:37] that that you are the final voice to the
[31:40] final age now now look at Ezekiel 3 and
[31:43] 17 you you kids family well good good
[31:46] for you amen it says son of man I have
[31:49] made thee a Watchman unto the house of
[31:51] Israel therefore hear the word of my
[31:54] mouth and give them warning from me and
[31:58] when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt
[32:01] surely die and thou givest him not
[32:04] warning nor speak uh nor speakest to
[32:08] warn the wicked from his way to save his
[32:11] life the same Wicked man shall die in
[32:14] his iniquity but his blood will I
[32:18] require at thine hand yet if you War the
[32:22] wicked and he turn not from his
[32:24] wickedness nor from his Wicked way he
[32:26] shall die in his iniquity would he yet
[32:29] uh but thou Hast delivered thy Soul so
[32:33] so we can see when God's word we we
[32:37] don't we we don't question God's word in
[32:39] the slightest when God's word says
[32:42] anything who are you to be afraid or
[32:45] ashamed to stand up for that word if God
[32:48] said it then you need to be bold enough
[32:50] to believe it and stand for it because
[32:54] there's somebody that needs to hear
[32:56] that and
[32:58] amen I I'm I'm not I listen I Don't Want
[33:01] to Go to Heaven by
[33:02] myself I want to take every lesbian I
[33:05] want to take every homosexual I want to
[33:08] take every transgender that I can find
[33:11] with me I want to show them the right
[33:14] way so that they well can you say Amen
[33:17] how many believes God that God loves
[33:19] alcoholics sure he does that's why he
[33:23] gave his
[33:24] word how many believes God loves uh
[33:26] transgender and and and homosexuals God
[33:30] loves them with an eternal
[33:33] love
[33:36] amen and God gave his word and when God
[33:39] gives us his word amen you and I then
[33:43] we're responsible for the knowledge that
[33:46] God has given us amen now look let's
[33:51] let's look at the mercy of God first 1
[33:53] Timothy 5 and 24
[33:57] the scripture says some men sins or yeah
[34:01] you can you can turn there that's that's
[34:03] all right we'll we we'll take our time
[34:05] here for a few
[34:07] moments first 1 Timothy 5 and
[34:12] 24 it says some men's sins are open
[34:17] beforehand going before the judgment and
[34:21] some men uh they follow after so so we
[34:26] can understand that there is there is
[34:29] those that are that that there are those
[34:32] who who are who are going to to God's
[34:34] going to show them uh his words it'll be
[34:37] the same books that are open today
[34:39] that'll be the same books that are open
[34:41] on the Judgment Day amen at the white
[34:44] Throne judgment the same books that are
[34:46] going to judge the people is the same
[34:50] book that you are being judged with
[34:53] right now the same word that you are
[34:58] receiving in your heart and you're
[35:00] repenting of those sins in your heart
[35:03] and you're making them right is going to
[35:06] be the exact same word that they're
[35:10] going to have to stand on on the day of
[35:13] judgment the only the only difference is
[35:16] is you have the opportunity to wash your
[35:19] garments to repent of those sins that
[35:22] you are doing you don't put those things
[35:24] under the rug you don't say well I'm the
[35:27] Bride of Jesus Christ so it doesn't
[35:28] matter what I do you don't know God
[35:31] loves you you're his bride you've taken
[35:35] his word and you have washed your
[35:38] garments you've washed the sins well
[35:41] glory to God the Bible says that you are
[35:44] going to be spotless pure undefiled Why
[35:49] by the washing of the Water by the
[35:56] word on judgment day at the white Throne
[35:59] judgment it's nothing but
[36:02] judgment on Judgment Day there is no
[36:05] saying
[36:06] sorry there is no there is no
[36:11] recourse there is no place to
[36:14] go can you say amen I think this is this
[36:18] is amazing amen so some men sins are
[36:22] open
[36:23] beforehand and the some men they follow
[36:25] second or 1 Peter 4 and 17 we can turn
[36:28] there too and I think these are these
[36:30] are good scriptures to turn
[36:32] to we um we we definitely appreciate the
[36:36] U uh the the the board but uh the these
[36:41] are good to write down amen and because
[36:44] brother Brandon's going to be talking
[36:45] about it in the church age book on the
[36:46] next lesson amen so 4 and 17 uh uh first
[36:52] Peter and it says for the time has come
[36:55] that judgment must be began at the house
[36:58] of God and if it first begin at us what
[37:04] shall the end be of them that obey not
[37:07] the gospel of God and if the righteous
[37:10] scarcely be saved where shall the
[37:14] ungodly and The Sinner appear you see
[37:18] what I'm saying so so here we stand here
[37:21] tonight and I think that there is a
[37:23] great responsibility on our shoulders
[37:26] now we look amen I'm wondering what kind
[37:31] of a Jesus is the world looking
[37:37] at it it it what kind of a Jesus now now
[37:43] I I brought
[37:45] some now if I were to sit here and tell
[37:49] you that this
[37:52] here amen is is an advocado what would
[37:56] you say
[38:01] amen why why is it that you can tell me
[38:06] what do you know what this is amen so
[38:10] why is it that you can tell me that this
[38:12] is
[38:13] lemon is because you know it for a fact
[38:18] I can try to tell you that it's an
[38:19] avocado but you've already know what it
[38:22] is right because we've already had an
[38:26] avocado I Hallelujah right here so there
[38:30] is an avocado and there is a
[38:33] lemon now what I just read in the
[38:36] scripture is just as real our opening
[38:41] scripture about homosexuality and
[38:43] lesbianism transgenderism that is such
[38:46] as real as this being a
[38:48] lemon and this being an
[38:55] advocado how is it
[38:59] it how is it that Jesus has
[39:06] become the figment of these people's
[39:10] imagination they think because they
[39:13] can't see him they think because they
[39:16] don't they can't see Christ they can
[39:18] make up whatever they want to of Christ
[39:22] sure and you know what the world is
[39:25] buying it the world world is buying
[39:29] it right
[39:32] see
[39:34] I I I could I could I could tell you
[39:37] anything if you don't know it if you
[39:40] didn't know my wife if you didn't know
[39:42] my if you'd never seen my wife and I
[39:44] have done this before amen I I I I've
[39:47] used this illustration uh when I went uh
[39:50] uh and preach places where they don't
[39:52] know me and and I'll tell them now my
[39:54] wife my wife will be here a little bit
[39:56] later on she's a blonde headed woman
[39:58] she's she's uh she she she's slim she's
[40:00] tall and uh she's got and I and and I'll
[40:03] just and I'll just put it out there and
[40:05] when you all see her amen make sure you
[40:07] let her know who she and and and and and
[40:11] and they're looking they come back and
[40:12] and and I'm preaching along these same
[40:14] lines and and then someone raises their
[40:17] hand and and and laughing and I say can
[40:20] I help you and they say we know what
[40:23] your wife looks like I've talked to your
[40:26] wife she is is not blonde she is a
[40:29] Cherokee
[40:32] Indian I had the rest of the people
[40:37] fooled I had the in all of the rest of
[40:40] them
[40:41] fooled but the woman that knew my wife
[40:45] says ain't buying
[40:49] [Music]
[40:51] it there's a lot of people claiming that
[40:54] they know
[40:56] Jesus and they don't have the slightest
[40:58] idea who he
[41:00] is for
[41:02] Jesus according to St John five uh uh St
[41:07] John 1 amen hope this uh don't go too
[41:11] slow but I just thought I'd take this
[41:13] evening and and enjoy and enjoy a little
[41:15] bit of teaching but there in 1 John 1
[41:18] And1 in the beginning was the
[41:21] word the word was with God the Word was
[41:27] God God the Apostle Paul that we just
[41:29] started out what's the very first thing
[41:30] that we read from the Apostle Paul I am
[41:33] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[41:36] Christ for it is the power of God under
[41:40] salvation in the beginning was the
[41:43] Gospel was the word the word was with
[41:46] God the Word was God the same was in the
[41:48] beginning with God now going on down to
[41:49] the 14th verse and the Word was made
[41:55] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[41:58] his glory the glory as of the only
[42:00] begotten of the father full of grace and
[42:03] truth so if you want to see Jesus
[42:07] today you're going to see his word
[42:12] living in human
[42:15] beings you see you see what I'm
[42:18] saying so so what are you looking at
[42:22] amen what what what if I what if y'all
[42:24] never
[42:25] seen uh uh uh uh you know I I I I seen I
[42:29] think the girls must have forgot uh
[42:32] their their uh their vacuum cleaner over
[42:34] here amen and and you know but I I I was
[42:38] I I was if you never seen a vacuum
[42:40] cleaner before amen and you kids had
[42:43] this had this vacuum cleaner and you and
[42:46] and you come and you turn it on and and
[42:48] and I could tell you how good that
[42:50] vacuum that that vac that vacuum cleaner
[42:53] is
[42:58] amen anyways so I could I could tell you
[43:02] how H how good this vacuum cleaner is
[43:05] and and and and how uh uh but but you
[43:10] see until you've experienced it until
[43:14] you know what it is then you could be
[43:16] duped by
[43:18] me you could be duped you could think
[43:22] you could think well well you know
[43:25] I you know I could I could tell you I
[43:28] don't know I could tell you that it's
[43:30] that it's a
[43:32] um a carpet cleaner or or or something
[43:35] like that
[43:37] huh it's a
[43:39] shampoo no
[43:42] okay is that is that thing making
[43:55] something Hallelujah
[44:03] I Tred but you can you can
[44:06] see how that if you don't know what it
[44:11] is I can convince you of of I can
[44:15] convince you one way or another but when
[44:18] you know what you know and you then you
[44:22] can believe what you believe then there
[44:26] is nobody that can ever take that away
[44:31] from you because you have experienced it
[44:34] for
[44:35] himself can you say Amen now amen now I
[44:40] want you to I want you to look here
[44:42] let's look here I want to show you
[44:43] something else let's let's look at
[44:45] something here in Mark Mark the 4th uh
[44:49] chapter and the um Matthew Mark Luke and
[44:54] we're going to start here at the 17th
[44:56] verse
[44:59] let's see uh Mark our 12th
[45:02] verse
[45:08] amen
[45:13] huh well what
[45:16] things
[45:18] things Hallelujah
[45:37] amen
[45:39] now there there Mark 4 4 and
[45:43] 12 amen it says that
[45:48] sing let's see let let's let's let's go
[45:51] to the 11th verse and he said unto them
[45:53] unto you is given to know the mystery of
[45:55] the kingdom of God but unto them that
[45:57] are without all these things are done in
[45:59] Parables that seeing they may see and
[46:02] not perceive hearing they may hear and
[46:06] not understand lest at any time they
[46:10] should be converted and their sins
[46:13] should be forgiven them so now they were
[46:15] asking if you were to go on up to the
[46:16] 10th verse when he says when he was
[46:18] alone they they asked him about the
[46:19] parable why why are you doing this in
[46:21] Parables he says because they're going
[46:24] to see and think they know what they're
[46:25] what they're seeing but they don't
[46:27] understand what they're they know
[46:28] nothing about it hearing they think
[46:30] they're they they've got all of this all
[46:32] here but they're not understanding it
[46:35] but he says but unto you is given to
[46:38] know the mystery of God can you say Amen
[46:43] now now now I I I I am the one that
[46:46] brought that up here and it just my it
[46:48] just didn't work I was I I tried it my
[46:50] office while ago and I plugged it up and
[46:52] it would just blow and steam out
[46:53] everywhere and I thought this is going
[46:54] to be great they're going to think it's
[46:56] a a vacuum sweeper and it didn't work
[47:00] amen but you see we the the the the so
[47:04] we want to we want to have an
[47:07] understanding of what Jesus we are
[47:10] looking at what if what if we thought we
[47:13] were we we were right and then we were
[47:16] deceived what if we thought that we knew
[47:21] the right
[47:22] way and we and and and and and we've
[47:25] known the wrong way the whole time but
[47:29] thanks be to the Lord that he gives us
[47:31] his Bible and he sends us a prophet to
[47:34] tell us go back to the Bible and that's
[47:37] what we have been taught now now this is
[47:39] what brother brandham would teach us he
[47:41] says now and and and he was talking
[47:44] about the the place over in India I
[47:46] believe it was there there in
[47:49] India and and he said U he um let's see
[47:53] no that's not it um uh he's talking
[47:56] about Shadrach Meshach and ab bedo he
[47:58] said did you ever notice the innocence
[48:00] of it and who that image was made of he
[48:03] said it was made of Daniel the image of
[48:06] a man he he didn't he didn't he say the
[48:09] spirits of the Gods Heathen as we are
[48:12] today we've got three and four of them
[48:14] the the spirits of the Gods lives in him
[48:17] and made they made an image unto Daniel
[48:20] and he said all that won't make bow to
[48:22] that image will be thrown into the fiery
[48:23] furnace now you notice Daniel is off the
[48:26] scene at that time get what I mean ever
[48:29] who would not bow to that image would be
[48:31] cut to pieces or thrown into lions or
[48:33] burned in the fiery furnace or something
[48:34] as a punishment and that's the way the
[48:37] Gentile dispensation begin with a pagan
[48:40] form of religious worship with the
[48:42] persecution of them who bow to it uh to
[48:45] make them bow to it and the Bible
[48:47] predicts it'll end the same way a holy
[48:50] man Jesus Christ an image to him to
[48:55] worship it and so forth so so brother
[48:58] bradam is telling us just as there in
[49:00] the Gentile when as it began with the
[49:03] Gentiles and they were all they we are
[49:05] all cre uh uh uh demanded to worship
[49:09] this this image of a holy man so is it
[49:13] going to be in the last days that the
[49:16] church is not going to worship Christ
[49:19] but an image like unto Christ a merciful
[49:25] loving uh one one that is inclusive one
[49:29] that is God so loved the world
[49:33] right and they they they have built this
[49:36] image unto the people amen another place
[49:39] there in the spoken word is original
[49:41] scene brother brandham says the
[49:43] Protestant hasn't got Jesus it's got a
[49:46] denomination the same thing an image
[49:49] unto the Beast amen so so we we want to
[49:54] re remember chain they changed the truth
[49:58] of God into a lie and worshiped and
[50:01] served the creature more than the
[50:04] Creator amen now now there as I was
[50:07] saying a while ago about that about that
[50:09] man in
[50:10] India that was healed and and he comes
[50:13] up there and he was you know the blind
[50:14] man brother Bram sees the vision of him
[50:16] he tells him of his past and tells him
[50:18] how while he came there how many
[50:20] children he had and all that and he
[50:22] turned around to the religious leaders
[50:23] of the world and he says now Gentlemen
[50:25] of the religions of the world your
[50:27] religion can do anything for this man he
[50:29] I said no more uh than than what to
[50:32] change his way of thinking you say well
[50:35] he's a son worshipper he went blind
[50:37] sincere in heart believed he was
[50:38] worshiping God uh he's he's worshiped
[50:41] the creature uh instead of the Creator
[50:44] the creation instead of the uh the
[50:46] Creator I said but he did it I said now
[50:51] uh why do you want to make a Jane out of
[50:53] him well you would tell him he was wrong
[50:56] and then that he should worship the
[50:58] insects uh what if what if you want to
[51:00] make him a cow worshipper you you would
[51:03] tell him he was wrong and worship the
[51:05] cow uh for the Muhammad the same way the
[51:08] Buddha the same way you would only
[51:10] change his way of thinking which is
[51:12] psychology he says we have the same
[51:14] thing in America only we don't have
[51:16] different gods but a man wants to make a
[51:19] Methodist out of a Baptist a Baptist
[51:20] wants to make a presbyterian out of the
[51:22] Lutheran the Pentecostal wants to to
[51:24] wants to assemblies out of the uh uh
[51:26] Oneness and the Oneness you know
[51:28] something out of something else what is
[51:31] it it's psychology that's right God
[51:33] saved certainly one true and living God
[51:35] it calls men to worship and we've got
[51:37] that in America the only only another
[51:39] form we only have one God but we have a
[51:42] lot of these different organizations
[51:44] that tries to make people think it's the
[51:46] it's the Methodist way or the
[51:47] Pentecostal way the Church of God way
[51:49] and it's just psychology but no matter
[51:51] what church you belong to if he isn't
[51:53] born again he is lost he said just
[51:57] another form the same devil it's just
[52:02] under another
[52:04] form thinking they're
[52:06] worshiping because they are Baptist or
[52:09] Pentecostal or they're Presbyterian or
[52:13] whatever and that makes them feel that
[52:16] they are right that makes them feel and
[52:19] and and now don't ever let that be that
[52:21] we just because we are message Believers
[52:24] that we're just trying to get convert
[52:26] people over to our way of thinking that
[52:29] is not the way it is it is a living God
[52:32] living in his word right
[52:36] now and that's why we've got to be born
[52:39] again so we're not trying to convert you
[52:41] children or convert uh uh the the world
[52:44] to to
[52:46] bromism we're bringing them to the
[52:49] present day
[52:52] scripture and if you don't see scripture
[52:55] today
[52:57] then you're the same as the Jews they
[52:59] could understand Moses but they could
[53:02] not see Jesus as the Living
[53:08] Word because Jesus doesn't want it just
[53:12] here Jesus was the word and that's what
[53:16] God is doing for us that's why we want
[53:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[53:21] only a born again person can truly
[53:24] reflect these scriptures in our lives
[53:26] yall understand what I'm saying so you
[53:27] can you can say well U you're in the
[53:30] wrong denomination you need to you need
[53:32] to come over here to and and and we and
[53:34] and how many how many has has has seen
[53:37] folks uh so excited when they first come
[53:40] to our
[53:41] church a new way of thinking it was all
[53:45] brand new H wow this is man and they but
[53:52] after a
[53:54] while it means nothing to to
[53:57] them see it's not converting somebody
[54:00] over to a new way you've got to be born
[54:04] again and then and only then can your
[54:07] body house the uh uh the The Living Word
[54:11] Jesus Christ can you say Amen Jesus said
[54:14] search the scriptures for in them you
[54:17] think you have eternal life and they are
[54:21] they that
[54:23] testify of me
[54:28] Hallelujah so so what was Jesus he said
[54:30] okay take your Bible don't dismiss it
[54:34] Jesus says here's the Bible take it read
[54:38] it here I
[54:40] am and they they're
[54:45] saying well but Moses see they couldn't
[54:49] see the present day scripture therefore
[54:52] they died they went into predition
[54:56] because God is in his word and God's
[54:59] revelation comes to us and when you
[55:02] refuse the light of the word as it comes
[55:05] then you must die how many how many
[55:07] remembers what it used to be uh what it
[55:09] was like there in in uh in the
[55:11] wilderness they they they were to follow
[55:13] the pillar of fire amen when the pillar
[55:16] of fire stopped then they would come and
[55:18] they they would put up their tents and
[55:19] then when the when the pillar of fire
[55:21] started moving on they had to pick up
[55:23] their tents amen the Levites had to get
[55:25] in order they had to take off amen and
[55:28] and and and
[55:30] anyone that that was left behind that
[55:33] says hey I just got here and put up my
[55:35] tent last night and I sure don't want to
[55:37] pick it back up amen they were left in
[55:40] the dark to wander without God and and
[55:44] and they perished in the
[55:46] wilderness okay so it is it's a type for
[55:49] you and me we want to always walk with
[55:52] God can you say amen amen John 10:37
[55:56] says if I do not the works of my father
[56:00] believe me not but if I
[56:05] do though you believe me not believe the
[56:10] works that you may know and
[56:13] believe that the father is in me I'm
[56:17] talking about a real
[56:20] genuine Jesus it was a real genuine God
[56:25] in the book body of Jesus Christ there's
[56:28] nothing mythical about it the Old
[56:30] Testament there was nothing mythical
[56:32] about it it was the pillar of fire that
[56:34] would come down amen before the people
[56:36] in the days of Jesus it was Jesus Christ
[56:39] the great God of Glory coming down God
[56:42] vindicating that he was alive and I just
[56:44] want to tell you today that God is still
[56:46] alive today and that he's vindicating
[56:50] himself by living in your body Oh Glory
[56:53] to God can you say amen amen that's
[56:56] that's exactly right amen so then we
[56:59] search the scripture to see what Jesus
[57:02] was to be and then you would see amen
[57:06] that he would that the Bible says he
[57:08] would heal the Blind and that he would
[57:10] set the captives free and that the
[57:12] spirit of the Lord God would be upon him
[57:14] and that this man would be the deliverer
[57:17] he would be the Messiah this would be
[57:19] the one oh glory to God Amen the
[57:22] Pharisees didn't understand him they
[57:24] were saying no you're not amen but the
[57:25] woman of the well says I have read the
[57:28] scripture you're the man you're the one
[57:31] we've been looking for you're that one
[57:34] this woman was a harlot this woman was a
[57:36] bad bad woman but God did not amen dumb
[57:41] down or water down the message to her
[57:44] amen it was the message that told her
[57:47] that says
[57:49] hey go get your
[57:51] husband she said I don't have it he goes
[57:54] well yeah you're right' you've had five
[57:57] and the one you're living with now is
[57:58] not
[58:06] yours she had a
[58:10] choice I perceive that you're the
[58:13] Messiah you're a
[58:15] prophet we've been told that when you
[58:19] come you were going to be that way see
[58:23] see it was God in the body of Jesus
[58:26] Christ not in the temple God doesn't
[58:28] live in temples God doesn't live in in
[58:31] in in in in in houses and things of that
[58:34] nature Hebrews 10:5 it says wherefore
[58:37] when he come into the world he said
[58:39] sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not
[58:40] but a body thou Hast prepared me God had
[58:45] a body acts 747 if you want to write
[58:48] them down but Solomon built him an house
[58:51] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[58:55] temples made with
[58:57] hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my
[59:00] throne and Earth is my foot stool what
[59:02] house will you build me sayeth the Lord
[59:03] what is the place of my rest see see it
[59:07] was it was not there there was nothing
[59:09] that a that a that a human could build
[59:12] for God but he says a body I'm looking
[59:15] for a body I've prepared a body I've
[59:18] prepared Oh Glory to God and what did
[59:21] Jesus do Jesus came to redeem us so that
[59:26] we would have be temples Tabernacle
[59:30] tabernacling the very God Almighty right
[59:33] here in leot to see why don't don't
[59:35] don't put that under a bushel don't be
[59:38] ashamed of who you are you are the
[59:42] Tabernacle of the most high God it's his
[59:45] word living in you he says I'll write my
[59:48] word in your heart I'll write my law in
[59:50] your mind amen you're going to they're
[59:52] going to know that you're my sons you're
[59:55] that I'm your a father and this is what
[59:58] God's desire
[1:00:01] is amen aren't you glad that God loves
[1:00:04] you yes amen now what did what did Jesus
[1:00:10] do Jesus just got through driving out
[1:00:13] all of the cellers out of the temple you
[1:00:15] take plated plated rope and I mean he
[1:00:18] went in there and they they had turned
[1:00:21] turned the temple into a a a just a a
[1:00:26] Big Show and selling and and making
[1:00:29] money and and so uh Jesus goes and and
[1:00:33] turns over all their money tables and
[1:00:35] and he says my house shall be called The
[1:00:37] House of Prayer y'all remember that and
[1:00:39] so so the the Ang the leaders were angry
[1:00:41] he says give us proof give us proof that
[1:00:43] you are who you are and this is what
[1:00:45] Jesus answered him there in John 2:18 it
[1:00:48] says then answered the Jews and said
[1:00:49] unto him what sign showest thou unto us
[1:00:52] seeing that thou has done thou doest
[1:00:54] these things Jesus answered and said
[1:00:56] destroy this
[1:00:58] Temple and 3 days I will raise it
[1:01:01] up then said the Jews 40 and six years
[1:01:05] was this temple in building wil thou
[1:01:07] rare it in three
[1:01:09] days but he spoke of the
[1:01:12] Temple of his body they couldn't
[1:01:16] recognize that he was the temple there's
[1:01:19] a song that we used to sing and you kids
[1:01:22] probably still sing it in Sunday school
[1:01:23] and things we I think occasionally sing

[1:01:51] John
[1:01:52] 147 Philip was saying show us the father
[1:01:55] amen and Jesus turned around and says
[1:01:57] have I not been so long A Time With You
[1:01:59] Phillip and you don't know who I am when
[1:02:01] you've seen me you've seen the
[1:02:04] father I'm his
[1:02:08] Temple

[1:02:13] scripture that says there in first first

[1:02:31] Holy Ghost which is in
[1:02:33] you you become God was in his temple in
[1:02:38] Jesus that's what they just got through
[1:02:39] saying there in Acts he was in his
[1:02:42] Temple Hallelujah Jesus was telling him
[1:02:46] I'm going to go to the Grave destroy
[1:02:48] this Temple and three days I'll raise it
[1:02:50] up again they couldn't understand it and
[1:02:53] I want to tell you you are the temple of
[1:02:55] of the most high God you live his
[1:02:58] character you live his word it's part of

[1:03:03] sure you you you have to repent of your
[1:03:06] sins sure there's plenty of those things
[1:03:08] amen but there's a different in sin
[1:03:10] singular and sins plural sin singular a
[1:03:15] is what that woman committed it's
[1:03:17] blasphemy it is unbelief do not believe
[1:03:20] the word of God but there are sins amen
[1:03:24] it's not the sin unto death brother
[1:03:26] Brandon would tell us amen that that the

[1:05:17] believest thou not that I'm in the
[1:05:18] Father the father in me the words that I
[1:05:20] speak unto you I speak not of myself but

[1:05:24] The Works amen John John 14:6 he says
[1:05:27] believest Thou not that I'm in the
[1:05:30] father and the father in me the words
[1:05:32] that I speak unto you I speak not from
[1:05:34] myself but the father that dwelleth in

[1:05:57] these shall he do because I go to my
[1:06:00] father and whosoever what's whatsoever
[1:06:03] ye shall ask in my name I will do that
[1:06:05] the father may be glorified in the son
[1:06:07] if you ask anything in my name I will do
[1:06:09] it oh glory to God down at 17th verse he
[1:06:12] says even the spirit of Truth whom the
[1:06:13] world cannot receive because it sees him
[1:06:15] not neither knoweth him but you know him
[1:06:18] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:06:21] you I won't leave you comfortless I will
[1:06:24] come to you yet while and the world sees
[1:06:26] me no more but you see me because I live
[1:06:30] you shall live also at that day you
[1:06:32] shall know that I'm in the father ye in
[1:06:34] me and I in you now before it was father
[1:06:37] in me and I in the father but then he
[1:06:39] says when the Holy Ghost comes it's
[1:06:41] going to be you and me I and you we're
[1:06:44] all are y'all y'all understanding it's
[1:06:47] the it's the presence of God living oh

[1:06:55] wonderful God's Divine love to every one
[1:06:58] of us amen his presence his glory his
[1:07:02] his love being exhibited through

[1:07:07] amen oh I love him here tonight amen
[1:07:12] amen that they're in the 16th chapter
[1:07:15] and I'm and I'm I'm wrapping it up here
[1:07:17] now John 16 and 16 it says yet a little
[1:07:19] while the world that you shall not see
[1:07:21] me and again a little while and you
[1:07:23] shall see me because I go to my father
[1:07:27] then said some of his disciples among
[1:07:29] themselves huh what is this that he
[1:07:31] saith unto us yet a little while a
[1:07:33] little while and you shall not see me
[1:07:35] and again a little while you shall see
[1:07:37] me because they go to the father and
[1:07:39] they said therefore what what what is
[1:07:42] this that he saith a little while and we
[1:07:45] cannot tell what he saith and Jesus knew
[1:07:48] that they were desirous to ask him he
[1:07:51] was a prophet and said unto them do you
[1:07:53] inquire among yourselves of that I said
[1:07:56] a little while and you shall not see me
[1:07:58] and again a little while and you shall
[1:08:00] see me verely verely I say unto You Weep
[1:08:04] uh or that you shall weep and Lament The
[1:08:05] World shall rejoice ye shall be
[1:08:07] sorrowful but your sorrow shall be
[1:08:09] turned into joy and and he goes on down
[1:08:11] to the the the 22nd verse and now
[1:08:14] therefore have sorrow you now have
[1:08:17] sorrow but I will see you again and your
[1:08:20] heart shall rejoice and your joy shall
[1:08:23] no man take from you in that day one day
[1:08:27] when the Holy Spirit comes back upon you
[1:08:31] you shall ask me nothing very very I say
[1:08:34] unto you whatsoever you shall ask the
[1:08:35] father in my name he will give it to
[1:08:41] you can you say
[1:08:44] Amen all right now I'm going to bring my
[1:08:47] thoughts

[1:15:36] be an alcoholic somewhere there got to
[1:15:39] be a transgender
[1:15:42] somewhere that'll lead the love of God
[1:15:44] and say come unto
[1:15:47] me surely there's something
[1:15:50] somewhere we've got the answer we're not
[1:15:53] living we're not looking down on down
[1:15:55] our nose at people and say oh You Filthy
[1:15:59] Rich they're humans just like
[1:16:02] you they got mamas and daddies just like
[1:16:06] you they've got children just like you

[1:16:16] hurt they're trying their best for their
[1:16:19] families just like you're trying your
[1:16:21] best for yours
[1:16:29] but we're God's mercy because if God has
[1:16:32] opened our eyes given us his word then
[1:16:35] we can take that word and and and and
[1:16:38] and express
[1:16:42] it that I become sometimes we wonder oh
[1:16:46] I wish sometimes we look back at our
[1:16:47] past and we'll look at our past and
[1:16:49] we'll say oh and and and Satan will hold
[1:16:52] that over your head hold it over you
[1:16:54] just just keep holding it over you then
[1:16:56] you don't realize that God allowed you
[1:16:58] to go through that Valley God allowed
[1:17:00] you to go through those mistakes so that
[1:17:02] he could open up your mind so that you
[1:17:06] could be a witness of his
[1:17:15] grace there's a real Jesus
[1:17:25] and I see

[1:17:50] nearsighted to just put it all on
[1:17:52] brother brandom
[1:17:59] that word that he gave us has now taken
[1:18:01] on flesh and
