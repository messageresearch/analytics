what God has done for us amen did you enjoy the message this morning amen I was blessed by it I trust you was you was blessed as well if you have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Daniel 3 and 7 then Philippians 2 and 5 like to say it is good to be back home um we had some we have some good Services while he's out on the road it's always it's always good to see the Lord moving with his people amen where two or three are gathered in his name he promised to be in the midst and going to different Church churches and seeing that they're they're holding up the same standard preaching the same message and God has proven proven with the same signs and wonders it's always a sh assuring that we're not by ourselves but there's a body around the world Amen Daniel 3 and7 um the Bible would say therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp the suck butt Sultry and all the kinds of music and all the people the the Nations and the languages fell down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up wherefore at the at that time certain chadians come near and accuse the Jews and they spake to and they spake and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever thou oh King has made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp the sack butt the sultry the deimer and all the kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and who so falleth not down and worship that he should be cast in in the midst of the burning fiery furnace and there were certain Jews and so he see the Bible lets us know that they were coming against the Jews but now it's coming down to just a certain few there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the providence province of Babylon Shadrach meach abedo these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up then in Philippians 2 and 5 let this mine be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and become obedient unto death even death of the Cross amen can we bow our heads this evening dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to say thank you Lord for this season Lord that we are in the Resurrection season father Lord I believe it's more than just the day but it's a reality father Lord what you done 2,000 years ago father but that Resurrection is still living today Father and Lord as we come into this part of the service I ask that you would anoint me Father Lord you know the needs and in the building father the hearts the desires father only you can meet them Father Lord we need you tonight Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated and I'm just going to continue on on the thought I've been preaching to people that that know their God um it's just something I've been studying on for some time so so I hope it's okay if I just continue on that but the Bible would tell us that the mystery of God should be finished so I believe that the understanding of who God is has been poured out in this generation where God is no longer veiled but the veil that had hid God has been loosed where we can see him in a reality we can experience his power experience his his being and and brother and brother Brandon would talk about the king that wanted his people to know him more but he also wanted to know his people more and so what he would do is he would change his mask he would change his form and take on the form of a peasant and and I like how brother Brandon he he tells the story he says the delegates would come up to him and said what are you doing he says I'm I'm going to go cut wood with the wood Chopper I'm going to go teal the ground with the tiller I'm going to go prune the vines with the pruners I'm going to take off my Royal garments and take on uh a peasant clothes so that my people can know me it didn't change who he was but he changed his form in order for somebody to seek him in a reality and so he would take on another form and and and reveal himself as a peasant and so would God wanted to know his people more but he also wanted you to know him more and so he would take on a form of a man and would experience the Pains of a man he would experience grief at the tomb of Lazarus he would experience weariness on the boat he would experience self-will in the Garden of Gethsemane he was wanting to know you more and so he would take on the form of a take on the form of humanity the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 4:15 for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the fing of our infirmities but with an all points tempted like as we are yet without sin it was God taking on the form of man so that he could feel your pain it was God taking on the form of man have having Judas his best friend turn against him so that he can experience the pain you go through when you have friends that turn against you he was taken on the form of man so that he could know you but at the same time he wanted you to know him so he would take on this form and brother Brandon would tell us that God was veiled behind Badger skins and when Christ would come he says that veil was rent from top to bottom and there stood The Mercy Seat upon the cross he says the veil was rent and he says and he asked the question why would he rent The Veil because he wanted them to see The Mercy Seat he wanted them to see him as who he was so in order for you to see him as who he was the veil had to be rent and in order for that Veil to be rent he had to take the form of humanity and I'm so thankful that he wanted you to know him so he would take on this for and brother Brandon would say this and that's what God did it's the same God all the time God in the form of the Father the spirit the pillar of fire the same God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and more faith brought out so he could be seen he wanted to be seen he wanted to be experienced he wanted somebody to know him in the power of the Resurrection in the dark times in the good times when you feel like you're all by yourself when you feel like you're all alone he wanted you to experience him you see this Easter season is more than just a holiday it's a reality it was God coming to Earth and letting you know I want you to know me I want you to experience I want you to experience a a sustainer a lifegiver a health Giver in the time of trouble it was God unveiled so that the world could be seen and and what is so incredible as brother Brandon would say there stood The Mercy Seat upon the cross but they were blinded to it he says there they there stood the Jews looking up The Mercy Seat looking at God but could not see him but the elected would see him and brother brandom says it's the same thing today and brother Brandon would say now it's repeated again the Traditions then on the day of Pentecost the world the word comeing was in the form of the son of man and they begin to organize it at and at IA Rome and the first thing they went to Methodist Baptist Presbyterians Pentecostals and so forth It's organized tradition till a man don't know where he stands oh my God wants a man to know where he stands and he says but glory to God he promised in the last days what he would do he would show his word in plain view open it up before us see it open it up and so just like God would rent The Veil when Christ was upon Earth he would come again in another form and rent the veil so that we could seek him once again we was God didn't want to be seen as a Creed he didn't want to be seen as a tradition he didn't want to be seen as these things there's no reality in a Creed there's no reality in a tradition but God wanted you to experience him in a reality God wanted you to experience him in the power of his resurrection so he would come in another form and rent the veil so that the realities of the supernatural will be poured out upon a family be poured out upon a young person hallelujah it's the windows of Heaven the realities of Jesus Jesus Christ being opened up to a generation that can see him in plain view not as a Creed but as a reality that's what this message come to do is open up your eyes so that you can see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever not no quotes not learn doctrines that's good and all but experience the realities of the supernatural so that you can wake up in the morning and if a mind battle comes against your mind you can overcome it when you go through depression you can overcome it when you go through complexes you can overcome it it was God opening up the realities of himself so that you can know him oh God wants to be known you know brother brandham tells us in the adoption series I believe that before the world was created before there was Angels before there was a moon before the before the garden was there in existence he said God was all by himself he was God alone and he inside of the inside of this being was attributes attributes to be a Healer attributes to be a deliverer attributes to be a father and these and these type of things but he says he was God alone and since he was God Alone he couldn't Express himself to nobody and so he created the angels and the angels would worship Him day and night holy holy holy H thou Lord but there was still something missing on the inside of God he wanted to express himself he wanted there to be a people that was bone of his bone life of his life that would experience the power of who he was the Angels were never lost the Angels were Never Bound for hell the Angels were never sick the Angels never went through depression the Angels never went through anxieties the Angels never went through heartbreaks so he couldn't Express himself and so he would create Man In His Image so that he could express himself and now here in the midst of Leo's Satan's eeden God is wanting to express himself as a friend that sticketh closer than a brother oh Hallelujah the same friend that guided Enoch is the same friend that is guiding us today the same friend that come and visited Abraham is the same friend that has come in this generation to let you know I am here to bring forth the promise you're not by yourself trying to make a Rapture I have come in a different form to give you the power the realities to bring forth the supernatural oh Hallelujah and so now there is a certainty of who we are he wanted his bride to know where she stood wanted to know a certainty and brother Brandon would tell us the Holy Spirit has been bound by denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself re revealed in human flesh in the evening time he sh it he promised it and so he wanted his Spirit to be loosed and come into a people into a flesh being once again and he promised it and he said it he was going to do and I like that brother brand puts it he said it he promised it and so how to take a message to take the realities and bring it into our life and I believe we've received that message and the supernatural has been opened up the Holy Ghost that was bound has now been loosed into our lives again and and and and a lot of this is coming from the unveiling of God so if you haven't heard that in a while it's a powerful message and brother Brandon would say it in the unveiling of God I see the Mighty God unveiled I see him pull back the cre the denominations pull back the Skeptics the educational programs and everything walk forward and stand there and and I like how he says this you think Creeds could conquer him you think denominations could conquer him you think think the world council could conquer him he conquered everything broke every feather ripped open hell tore off the seal entered into the holiest of holies unveiled himself to us being the word the same yesterday today and forever and he says amen how I love him and he says you think Creeds could conquer him you think that Traditions could keep him from coming and revealing himself to you the devil has another thing coming he thought he could keep you from the realities of God so he would throw traditions on you he would throw Creeds on you he would put you in false doctrines trying to keep you from receiving the realities but God my brother Brandon would say you think that could conquer him but he ripped off the veil he tore off the things that you was bound by and would reveal himself to you so that you can experience him oh Hallelujah so that you can experience him he's been unveiled to us in this generation and then brother brandom says how by the word oh my that's how deity is coming or midst by the word cuz everybody claims to have deity the Baptists have deity the Presbyterians the Pentecostals they all got deity but what is deity what is deity it's the supernatural word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so in order to have deity in the midst you have to have the word oh come on now so in order for God to have a people that could experience himself there had to be a perfect word and so he would get a messenger and form him and make him with a certain with a certain demeanor a certain desire certain makeup and would give him a message so that you could have a perfect word so that you can experience him so that he could unveil himself to you and you see brother Brandon in that message the unveiling of God talks about the violin and brother Brandon our brother Andrew preached on it when he was here last and I love brother Brandon he talks about it and he says the auctioneer says what am I offer and he says they looked at and didn't realize what was there nobody was willing to pay the price and he says I I'll give you $1 another person says $5 $10 $15 and brother brandom says now there was a man that was standing in the midst that didn't think it should go for that little and so what he would do is he would come and pick up the bow he would tighten up the bow he would pick up that that violin and would start to play music and he says everybody started to cry because they' never heard such beautiful music and then the auctioneer says now what are you offering and one person says 1,000 5,000 10,000 and brother brandom says what was it the Master's Hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument oh man it took the Master's Hand in this generation to reveal what was inside of this word it was failed by Traditions it was failed your rapture was been right here but it was failed your body change was right there but it was failed but God would come in this generation and rip off the veil rip off the seals rip off these things it says here's a Rapture here's a body change here's your future hope here's the Millennium it's all right here here is the fullness of who I am I'm unveiling myself so that you can see me oh Hallelujah it was the Master's Hand that would reveal what was hidden there your name was hidden there oh the Lamb's Book of Life had your name on it had everything right there but it was veiled to us but the Master's Hand would unveil it and say hey you didn't become seed at the new birth you always was a Son of God you was in my mind from before the foundation of the world and brother Brandon would say so now in this age when the old denominational and traditional veil has been rent from the word of God so it can be manifested see what I mean the tradition says all those things are passed let us soak a little bit these things are passed but in this last day the traditional veil has been wrent and here stands the pillar of fire see here he is manifesting the word for this day the veil has been rent and so the very purpose of God coming and enveil himself was for his word to be manifested and but I like how brother brandom says it what stood behind the veil was the pillar of fire manifesting the word for this day oh my so there's the mechanics and the Dynamics that was veiled up but once the veil would come come off of it there would be a people that could experience not just the mechanics but the Dynamics and when those two come together it's a Powerhouse that the gates of hell do not know what to do with oh Hallelujah there stands the pillar of fire manifesting the word of God but brother Brandon would say whenever wherever the word is it's always veiled he says the word is UN veiled to the bride but it's veiled to the unbelievers and then he talks about the drama he says one actor can have many different veils have many different masks and he says the word has had many different masks and he talks about he talks about how Moses was veiled and the Bible would say that Moses had a veil his Veil his face his face because he was the word Jesus was veiled the word was veiled in him then brother brandham talks about the Tabernacle and and it's so incredible says the badger skins veiled the glory of God and the people couldn't see it because they couldn't get past the skins and I thought my that's why many people can't see this message is because they can't look past the skins of humanity they can't look past the skins of human flaws and human weaknesses but on the other side of the skin was the shakana glory brother Brandon would say it was the shoe bread that was behind those skins and I think my goodness behind the skins of humanity in this generation was the sh Glory being unveiled it was the shoe bread a spiritual food in due season it was behind the Skins so if we could ever look past the skins of humanity we will see what God is doing in this generation but then brother Brandon continues on that now he's veiled in his bride and what is so incredible is brother Brandon would say it was once an animal living behind those skins talking about the badger skins he says but now with hiding the glory of God it's the housing for the glory of God then he stops and he says so can your skins be changed and be made into a housing place for the glory of God God dwelling in humanity so you see the purpose of God unveiling himself was God coming inside of humanity to fulfill his words so just like God was dwelling behind Baner skins in the Tabernacle but now he's dwelling behind human skins he's he's dwelling behind a teenager skin a young boy skin a daddy's skin a mama skin inside of those skins is no longer a carnal nature it's no longer the things of the world now it's deity inside of those skins the same Pillar of Fire that was veiled behind the badger skins is now veiled inside of a human skin Oh hallelujah it's the same Pillar of Fire that L it led the children of Israel out of Egypt is the same Pillar of Fire that is leading this bride all the way to the coming of the Lord so God want enveil himself to be veiled in your skins that is just so incredible the God would come and pay the price for your sins he would have his beard plucked out he would be beaten he would be scorched he would go through these things so that he can be veiled in your skins oh my so he's taking the ordinary and making something great and brother Brandon would say it was God above us God with us now it is God in us he's taking something ordinary and I like it brother brand I talked some of it last time but brother Brandon preaches the super sign and he says that they think by super they got to do away with the ordinary and make something great he says they're doing away with the old the old automobiles he says it used to take 16 days to get over to the West Coast now it takes four days he says they used to have two lane two lane highways now there's four lane highways he says they're something great and something super but they're doing away with the ordinary or they're doing away with with uh yeah with the ordinary and I think M we see that taking place here here in the in Tulsa Oklahoma City you've got the old part of Tulsa and the new part of Tulsa instead of just refurnishing and rebuilding the old part of Tulsa they do away with that and start a new and I think my that's not the way God works he ain't doing away with the ordinary and making something new to be a super race but he's taking the ordinary he's taking the one with human flaws he's taking the one with human weaknesses he's taking the ordinary daddy the ordinary mother the ordinary teenager and railing himself inside of those skins and Performing the super sign performing a super a super race upon this Earth I say Church we're the most powerful people that is upon the face of the Earth today you've got deity inside of your skins performing The Works that God said for this generation it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever inside of your skins oh brother Brandon would say I'm telling you when you break the traditional barrier that Jesus is way back there and he isn't now when you find he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what can what God can do right here in this convention and to show his world and show this world what they need not it's not a world fair but a Revival World Revival that would be filled that that it'll be filled and baptized with the presence of the Living God and morphe en veiling himself into human flesh Hallelujah I believe it broken every barrier every Veil every Veil nothing can hide his presence when people get hungry in the heart there's the veil ready to be broke you can depend on that rent every veil by his Holy Spirit and here stands tonight the mighty conqueror the same yesterday today and forever Healing The Sick baptizing the Believers just as he did he's the mighty conqueror doomed Devils around the Run oh he says if somebody gets hungry enough to see God unveiled there will be a veil that will be rined oh when I say I'm hungry inside of my soul I want to see a living God if I'm not seeing a living God why serve God if I'm not not seeing a God that can deliver alcoholics why serve us God if I'm not seeing a God that can deliver from pornography why serve him but I believe we are seeing God if somebody gets hungry enough to search for him and to look for him the veil will be rent off oh there's more veils than just Traditions there's veils of unbelief there's there's veils of doubt there's veils of skepticism there's veils of all of these things that try to keep you from say the almighty God but I say tonight let's get hungry and rip off the veil if we got to go make things right let's go make things right if we got to rip the veil of Gossip off let's rip it off if we got to rip off the veil of bitterness let's rip it off if we got to rip off the veil of hidden sins let's rip it off so that we can see God in our homes in our families in our churches I want to see a living God I want to see a god Mighty in battle I want to see a god filling our young people I want to see a God keep them marriages together I want to see a god let's rip off the veils let's rip off the veils so that we can see the mighty conqueror the same yesterday today and forever brother brandom says nothing can hide his presence when people get hungry oh nothing can hide his presence when somebody gets hungry oh I say Lord I'm hungry I want to see the supernatural I want to see his presence like never before I'm hungry for the supernatural oh my brother brandom says God changes his mask but never his nature oh my changes his mask but never his nature so in other words when he was veiled in Moses his nature brought forth the supernatural it was his nature that would bring forth lies that would bring forth the lies in these things when he was veiled behind Badger skins it was his nature that would bring the dead Rod back to life when he was veiled in Jesus his nature would fulfill the word and today when he's veiled in your skins his nature is the same as when it was behind the badger skins oh my that Old Rod that was dead but there was a life that could bring it back to life oh my you might be dead this evening you might be in addictions you might be in trespasses but the same of kind of Glory can come inside of your skins and bring this germ seed of God that is on the inside back to life so that you can see the manifestation of the word of God oh hallelujah it's the same nature he's taking humanity and bringing forth the same nature brother Brandon would say super Ray super ways super everything got to be greater than the ordinary one's man he has a super house that change it every year 1962 model houses won't be no good in 1963 your refrigerator has got to be a little super it's got to be a step up it's got to step up a little more just put a little more or a little more ornaments on it and make you swap the old one in and pay a couple $300 more to get another one and so they're doing away with the ordinary and trying to make something great but God has taken Humanity has taken the ordinary and is making something great right here as human weaknesses and brother Brandon would he would say this in the Easter seal now notice Pentecost their bodies were quickened by the new life they received that makes me feel religious think now here was men fishermen Tax Collectors humble Little Women and just ordinary Housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were believing that this was the truth their bodies were quickened who was that brother Josh the ordinary people not the not the not the great flashy ones or the ones with money the ones with great intellect Peter couldn't even sign his name but it was an ordinary man that God would come and reveal himself to so God takes the ordinary and brother Brandon he would call these men or these these individuals ordinary he says Joshua was an ordinary man but God calls the son to stand still Mary was just an ordinary girl but through her come deity Abraham was just an ordinary man but through his seed would come the Savior Noah was just an ordinary farmer but through him God saved his seed Moses was just an ordinary man but would defeat the greatest military upon Earth and right here is ordinary individuals that God is calling to be a rapturing generation you might got fls you might got weaknesses you might got human mistakes you might got a past you might got things you're not proud of but God has called the ordinary God has called the ordinary and has poured out deity inside of your life that goes past the Falls past the mistakes past the addictions past the past and say hey I'm calling you for a special purpose somebody's got to make a Rapture somebody's got to see a body change somebody's got to reain in the Millennium and I'm calling Ordinary People to do it I'm calling Ordinary People to do it brother the Brandon was say Jesus never took them come the people to be his disciples he took the unlearned people the fish nobody's connected with their churches and things he just got ordinary men Tax Collectors Farmers Fishers and so forth to do his work see cuz they are nothing and then he can make something out of them see as long as they keep thinking or keep knowing that they're nothing than God can work and I say my that's why new life that's what new life Outreach knows it's we are Ordinary People we're nothing but God has taken this nothing and has made something through it but oh my brother Brandon would say God hides himself in a simple little wash woman or an or ordinary man with dinner under his arms kiss his wife and children goodbye and go out there maybe hide himself in that man to do something that an ark Bishop would know nothing about see you don't hear him blow no horns and send it out God just gets the glory the simple hear it hander glad now God was hiding himself in the Simplicity of a baby he hiding him self in the Simplicity of a common family oh my and here God is again hiding himself in some empty vessels in Simplicity God hiding himself in ordinary nobodies you know brother the Bible would tell us of the widow woman and Elisha her sons were about to be sold and all that she had was a little bit of oil in in in in a little vessel and the and the pr were to come up to her and say how much oil do you got and she says this is all I God and he would say okay go to the neighbors go abroad go out there and get all of the empty vessels get all of the empty vessels and bring him to me and he and and as they would bring all of these empty vessels into the house he would take the little course of oil that was a little bit hair and would poured in the first oil or the first vessel poured into the second vessel all that was in the course of oil he would pour inside of those vessels but he didn't run out after the first one he didn't run out after the the second one but all the empty vessels that would be called he would have enough to fill them oh one little church God going run out of himself after 120 in the upper room but all of the empty vessels that he is calling for this generation ordinary vessels Broken Vessels heartbroken vessels vessels with with mistakes and flaws all of the empty vessels he is called he is still feeling he is still pouring out deity maybe you're here tonight say brother Josh I'm empty I want to know this God he is still filling the empty vessels if you're willing to empty yourself out and say Lord Veil yourself in me he will come oh you notice that Elijah Elisha didn't say go get all the vessels he said get the empty vessels not the full ones not the on that are half full not the ones that are 3/4 full get the empty ones oh my too many of us want D to come in but we're still full of bitterness we're still full of Pride we're still full of Skeptics we're still full of these things but Empty Out Your Vessel empty out your being you might be smart you might know this message backwards and forwards but you got to empty yourself out come on Church you got to empty yourself out out of all of your knowledge out of all of your learning out of everything that you got you've learned throughout the years you got to empty yourself out so that deity can come and dwell in humanity come on now God don't want learning he wants deity in humanity he don't care how many quotes you can quote he don't care how many scriptures you can quote he don't care how much knowledge you got he wants deity inside of humanity the priests they could quote the scriptures I'm preaching now all of those other ones they were learned in scripture they were learned in theology they went to the seminaries but they missed deity you can be learned in the seminaries you can be learned in this message but if you miss deity you miss the entire unveiling of God but I say Lord I'm not worried about my learning I want to see deity I want to see the realities of Jesus Christ in my flesh Hallelujah huj I may be just ordinary Hallelujah but Lord make me something special that's why New Life Outreach is separate from all of the other what 17 churches just an ordinary church but she was in this ordinary church was broken this ordinary church was hurt she was scarred but her deity would come and dwell inside of New Life Outreach dwell inside of New Life Outreach brother Brandon would say the Shak Glory manifest him it brings forth the Word of Promise right out to you that's the reason that he had TOA Moses face because in him was the word he veiled Jesus a humble little man to keep from to keep them from seeing Jehovah and he veils himself today in Earth and vessels with the shik glory and I and I love this part the outside looks like a bunch of Holy Rollers bad your skins but the inside hides the sh kind of Glory oh the outside of you the the world looks at and say I know what he used to do I know what she used to do but in the inside there was deity with the Brandon would say what was in the inside of that skin back there what once what was on the inside the skin back to the old Bounder skins which there was no beauty that we should desire and it when it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it still had no beauty that we should desire it and now the same thing today there was nothing in a man or a woman that can be desired it's what is behind there that's what it is well you say that fellow I I know he used to be a drunker he used to do this I don't care what he used to do what's behind the skin what is behind there that's what counts and that's why the people is blinded the Skins the people they say remember when the woman used to do I know what she used to do but what about now oh and he says that's what blinds many people is the Skins the people know what you used to do but he says I don't care what you used to do what about now what is dwelling in there now oh my and and you know and and that's embarrassed dad but that's what I've Loved about Dad all of these years he's willing to look past the skins and he sees good in every everybody and I say Lord let us let us all be that way let New Life Outreach be that way that can look at somebody that's hurting but see deity that can look somebody with flaws and see deity let us be a church that way oh my brother brandom says the Reason God unveiled himself was to fulfill his word so the very reason of the unveiling of God was for God to come in Earth and vessels and the Bible would say in 2 Corinthians 4:7 but we have the treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God not of us and so this word has brought a certainty where there was no certainty in Creeds no certainty in denominations but the word has brought us a boldness a certainty brother Baron would say this and Peter said such as I have I will give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ excuse me rise up and walk they had a hidden power they dressed like other men they walked on the street they ate like other men but they had a blessing on the inside that gave them certainty to know where they were standing oh my and that's what we need today is certainty to know where we are standing because with Humanity comes fears with Humanity comes complexes with Humanity comes insecurities and with Humanity comes these other things so we needed something to bring a security we needed something to bring bring and let us know that we don't know what tomorrow holds but we know who holds tomorrow because in humanity we don't know what tomorrow holds and some people get they get uh they get anxiety they don't know they don't want to go outside because they don't know what's going to happen or they can't they they can't do this they can't go there because of a fear it's Humanity that has fears but this word has brought us a hidden power that there can be certainty that overcomes the fears that overcomes Humanity where we can face the world and know that I'm an overcomer you see we need it there's a blessing of a certainty and the Bible would say in Isaiah 44 and8 fear ye not neither be afraid have not I told thee from that time and have declared it ye are even my Witnesses is there a god beside me yay there was no God I know not any so fear not nor be afraid have not I told thee and so the certainty that we are experiencing is not from a feeling not from an emotion but from the word of God it's the word of God that is letting you know have not I told you that you are going to Reign Victorious I know you might be in a circumstance now but I've already told you that you're going to overcome it and then he turns it around and says ye are my Witnesses how do you become a witness it's deity coming on the inside the Bible would tell us in Acts 1:8 that ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses so the word come to comfort and let you know that you're going to overcome but then it gives a hidden power to overcome with oh come on church it's the same comforter that is letting you know you're going to rain is the same comforter that is coming inside and raining through you it's not us trying to do it ourselves but it's a hidden power deity coming inside and and fulfilling the word of God oh man you see how certain this word is because he would say I would have a bride without spot and without wrinkle that is certainty how would he know that he would how could he be so certain because he was going to come himself and fulfill the word of a spotless bride that's how he could be certain and the Bible would tell us in Daniel 6:17 and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the dean and the King sealed it with his own signant and with the signant of his Lords that the purpose might not change concerning Daniel and so since the king had a purpose and wanted it to be fulfilled he would seal he would he would seal it with his own seal and I think my another King has done that in this generation he wanted there to be a bride with spot and with her wrinkle and in order for this to take place he had a seal it with his own seal oh my then God himself would come and seal himself in and seal the devil out so that the purpose of the word could be fulfilled I say little church that's why we can't be defeated that's why we can't be overcome because there's another Power another Authority that has come on the inside that is greater than our Humanity that is greater than our human weaknesses it's the Seal of God coming and protecting the purpose of God oh come on now it's the Seal of God protecting the purpose of God and I say Lord thank you for calling me to do a special purpose and sealing yourself in me to fulfill it and brother Brandon would say this here and Daniel went in without any uncertainty God is able to deliver from the Lions and I believe when the lion started up there to look at him there stood a Halo of fire around Daniel any animal has scared of fire you know that those Lions backed off what was it the hidden power that was in Daniel's heart come out and clothe him all over oh little church the hidden power that was once on the inside didn't come out of to the humanity and would protect him from the things he was going through that's why you're standing here today and haven't lost the battle yet because the hidden power that is on the inside has come out of your humanity and is bringing forth the victory oh and he continues on to say it was that hidden power the blessing of God God that was upon the prophet's life that enshrouded him with the Flaming fire like like down at dayam that when when Gesa looked and saw that there was around Elijah angels of fire Chariots of Fire there that hidden power was around Daniel and what was that hidden power to do it was to bring forth a security that hidden power on the inside would come out and say hey hey Lions you're not taking him I've got a purpose for his life and that's why the job would say though God slay me yet I would trust him there was a hidden power bringing forth a certainty of security and brother Bron would say that Steven had so much of this blessing in him till he became a different man and what is so incredible he says what happened the heavens opened up and the spirit that was on him opened the clouds went through the Stars through the midst until he seen Jesus standing at the right hand of the father what was it his certainty the hidden power opened up a channel that looked past his present circumstances come on Church there's a hidden power inside of this Pride that has opened up a channel that looks past all of your present circumstances look past the things you're going through and sees Jesus at the right hand of the father there's been a channel that has opened up the supernatural it's the hidden blessing of certainty and brother Brandon would say this that the devil had man blocked from God but when Christ came he went beyond the veils of every sphere he went beyond the veil of death he went beyond the veil of grave and rent the veil of sickness rent the veil of fear every Veil that there was he would destroy and here we stand today in this Easter season standing Victorious because every fear every anxiety everything the devil will throw upon us has been rined and here's a channel that is opened up if you got lost loved ones there's a channel that is opened up if you need Deliverance there's a channel that has been opened up if you need a refilling of the Holy Ghost there's a channel that has been opened up where we can see stepen saw Jesus he seen the realities oh I believe this bride can see the realities it wasn't Steven making something up he wasn't making up an imaginary story but he could see the realities and and I believe this bride ain't making up stories she ain't making up some imagination fairy tales but she has experienced the power of the Resurrection that has changed her desires changed her likes and one day it's going to change her body we're not making something up we're experiencing a hidden power on the inside of our Lives hallelujah it's a hidden power oh my the world don't know what to do about it the devil don't know what to do about it but it's hidden inside of some Earth vessels oh hallelujah hallelujah he rent the veil of sickness the veil of fear every ve there was he would destroy and all above and there he opened up a channel the god used to come down through all the corridors of heaven and talked to Mankind in the Garden of Eden and Satan by sin had them blocked but the great high priest with his Anointed with his blood excuse me with his blood rent through everything rip open every rip open and cleared all the skies again that God and man could be father and son and commune again with another what a marvelous thing oh my you see what God has done in this generation he has brought God and man back in talking terms once again it's no longer you going to a prophet and saying hey what did God tell you are you going to a priest and saying hey can you talk to God for me but now there's a Channel all of those Veil has been opened up that you can come before the throne of grace with boldness and ask for what you have need of and God will bring it the past oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would say this brother I'd rather have all of that all I rather uh I would rather have in all the education all the money you can pile up before me all my education I will drop it here all my mental theology I will leave it here all my wealth I will leave it here but the hidden power that thing made the certainty of the Gospel it will take you to heaven and carry you through the valleys of the shadow of death oh my that that's the reason you know as as we was at the Martin's funeral Friday that's the reason they can make it through this UNC time there's a hidden power there's certainty knowing that we're going to see him again brother M that's why you made it through losing Adam sister Leah because there was a certainty knowing that we're going to see him again the Bible would say Comfort one another with these words there's a certainty that has been poured out we don't know what's going to take place you may die tomorrow I might die tomorrow you might lose a loved one tomorrow we don't know but there's a certainty of because of a hidden power so the devil knows that he can't take away your hidden power but what he can do is take away the certainty of it and it's give me a few more minutes and I'll bring this to a close the Bible would say in 1 John 3:21 beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God and so if our heart condemn us not then we have certainty and so that's what the devil does he's an accuser he will come with accusations and say oh yeah that God has power to heal God has power to save but then he comes and condemns you and he changes your certainty towards the word of God because you remember in the garden God would come and speak to Adam and Eve but what happened after Adam and Eve fell the same word that was once bringing hope is now bringing condemnation it was God coming up and saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou but now they're running from the presence of God God didn't change his word God didn't change his nature but because of condemnation it drove him away from certainty and oh my condemnation will do that it would drive you away from the power of this message it would drive you away from the authority of this word but I believe that once you've repent of your sins and of those addictions it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness that that channel can be opened right back up again but that's exactly what the devil likes to do is he tries everything he can do to destroy the certainty of God in his word because you you can look at job and look at the certainty of the word of God concerning job the Bible would say in Job 1 And1 and there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that fear God and it shoot evil then you come down to Job 1 and8 and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there was none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and asseth Evil I don't think that's a coincidence that the very same thoughts that God has of job job's manifesting it was the certainty of God's word it was the certainty coming to a vessel and manifesting the thoughts that God have D of job I believe before job was ever on the earth God already had those thoughts but you see that then there come an accuser that would come and try to destroy the certainty of job and because of the accuser he would lose his children he would lose his livestock he would lose his servants and then what did the accuser do next he would turn his wife against him and what I think is so incredible is that the devil can anoint anybody to try to destroy your certainty they may not mean to they might be in a bad mood or be wake up on the wrong side of the bed but the the Accuser what can anoint anybody to destroy the certainty cuz you know the Bible would say that job looked to his wife and would say you speak like a foolish woman and brother Brandon would say he didn't call her a foolish woman she said she spoke like a foolish woman so in other words she wasn't foolish on the inside but what she was speaking was anointed by something else oh my so loved ones can sometimes become anointed to try to destroy and bring down your certainty but don't turn against them don't become bitter to say hey let your heart say they're speaking like a foolish person but God still has something on the inside because you know what the devil was trying to do was get him to second guess his atonement cuz what did what did his friends come and say you're a secret sinner you've done this God is against you you're doing this and you're doing that what was they doing they was trying to get him to second guess his atonement and something that really struck me is that said if he started the second guess his own atonement what about his children cuz the Bible would say in job 1:4 and as job's went and his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone his day and sent and called for three sisters to eat and drink with him and it was so and when the day of their feasting were were about gone about then job and job sent and S Sanctified them rose up early in the morning offered burnt offerings according to the number of them for job said it might be that my sins have my my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus job did job continually and that dist struck me that if the accuser could get him the second guest his own atonement where would his faith be for his children and I think my that's exactly why the accuser comes against parents comes against your mind comes against your families because he knows if he can get you to second guess this message what's left for your children if he can get youed doubt this message what's left for his children but I believe what the Bible would say in job 1:22 in all of this job sin not nor charge God foolishly and all that he went through all of the accusations all of that that the accuser was putting upon him he still stood with the testimony that he he did not lose his certainty and I believe we can do that today as parents might go through mind battles we might go through hard times that the Deacon might go through hard times or Pastor might go through hard times but we can still stand with the certainty though God slay me yet I will trust him the lord taketh the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but Blessed Be Thy holy name in the midst of the accuser we don't have to lose our certainty the Apostle Paul would say but none of these things move me none of these things move me off of my certainty and I believe we can still stand with the certainty and my opening scripture is talking about Shadrach MCH and abedo they was accused and the Bible would say that the accuser were come and accused these certain Jews and it was because they wasn't bending to the pressure and the accuser would then throw them into the fire because they wasn't bending and oh my the accuser didn't go to the ones that was bowing he didn't go to the ones that were bending but he went to the ones that were certain and oh my if the devil's coming against you and the accusers is coming against you it's because he hasn't got you yet but you notice what happened after this the Bible would say that in the midst of the fire then there would come the Fourth Man and that what is so lovely about that story is right there in the midst of the accusation it was the accusation that bound them it was the accusation that threw them in the fire but then Nebuchadnezzar would look down and say didn't we throw three men bound into the fire but then he said below there's four men loosed walking in the midst of the fire what changed it the unveiling of God coming in the midst would break the accusation that would bind them that they could go free oh in little church we might get past we make a mistakes but he has come in the midst the Fourth Man In The Fire to break the accusation over our life that we can stand with the confidence oh he has come in the midst the Bible will tell us that Daniel that the accuser would accuse Daniel and that was the reason Daniel was in the Lion's Den was because the accuser would accuse him but then the Bible would say in Daniel 6 and 22 my God has sent this Angel and has shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocence was found in me and so there in the midst of the accusation he was found innocent I hope you're hearing me tonight in the midst of the ACC accusation there comes somebody in the midst because the Bible says before him there I stood innocent before him the one in the midst the accusation could not stand oh my in the midst of the unveiling of God in the midst of God coming in your presence that destroys the accusation of sins in the past it destroys the accusations of addictions that once held your life so that you can come back in the certainty of the the gospel and come with boldness oh the Bible would say that he cast down the accuser that that accused the brethen day and night the accuser was cast down but then the Bible would say they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony their testimony was greater than the accusation and you know something that just struck me that the testimony of what God is doing for you is greater than your past it don't matter what the devil may have done through your body what God is doing today is greater than the accusation that the devil's trying to use to bring down your certainty Hallelujah that's good he cast down the accuser but you still had overcome him you still got to battle that accuser even though he's cast down you got to battle him but how are you B how are you overcoming him how do I overcome him brother Josh the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony before him is found innocency the Bible would talk about would talk about the woman that was caught in the in the act of adultery and what what what what and these things have been just standing out to me as I as I've been studying on these things that the Bible would say that they would throw this woman at the feet of Jesus that they might accuse him and if you just look up that word accuse or accus there's there's a lot of these things that they threw this woman at the feet of Jesus that they might accuse him but there was perfect there was nothing to ACC acced but then what happened he didn't want this Perfection just staying with him and the Bible would say he would start to ride in the sand he will look up and the Bible says he stood alone in the midst of the woman in the midst and in the midst of the woman he would turn around and say woman where were thine accusers but in the midst of deity the accusers had no accusation and she would say Lord I have none neither do I accuse you and so this perfect state that he had he were now bestowed to a fallen Humanity Humanity with flaws Humanity that was caught in the midst of adultery Humanity that had a pass but in the midst he could bestow a forgiveness that would break the accusation oh little church and in the midst God Has Come God has come in our midst that he could break the accusation that we can stand before him blameless the Bible would say in Joel 226 and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that he had dealt wondrously with you my people shall never be ashamed never be ashamed the next verse and she and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God none else and my people shall never be ashamed I don't think it's coincidence that he says it twice that my people should never be ashamed but the accusers been cast pass down and I have come in the midst and since I am in the midst the accuser has no accusation since he's D wondrously with us we don't have to be ashamed oh Hallelujah we don't have to be ashamed of our past we don't have to be ashame and I I read this I think a couple sermons ago brother Brandon would saying think of it not one believer of any age needs to cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in the first age when the when the apostles were first sent out there was no need to look back look up Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages Behold Him who is the same yesterday today and forever who never changes either in essence or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their midst and not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is Oh Glory there he stands expressing exactly what he is but you got to Behold Him He says don't look back and wish we was there in the first church age when the apostles were sent out but he says Behold Him Now even present tense walking in the midst walking in the middle not not on the side not on the front not on the back but right in the midst and brother Brandon would say not as a complacent onlooker or recording Angel but he stands expressing exactly what he is let our musicians come tonight he has come in the midst brother Brandon would talk about uh the woman out the well and this is just so amazing he says no what did this putting the old scripture with that with the experience Jesus was given to her what did it do and made the Messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking now at the beginning so it redeemed her or brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifested what he was what he is so when she seen God unveiling himself that would redeem her back to the thoughts God had for her and oh my here she was with five husbands the one she was with now wasn't even hers but she was redeemable and whenever she would see God unveiled then that would open up a channel to the mind of God and then here would come the thoughts a perfect image that God had of her life then would come inside of a vessel and manifest that Perfect Image oh my even though she was condemned by her past condemned by things she was doing brother brandom says and he se you a human being like you are and though there come millions of years yet there's nothing that can keep you from coming back to the perfect image that God ordained for you in the beginning oh my he's in the mid breaking the back of the accuser breaking the back of the accuser and brother brandham he preaches on Easter and it says when he rose e Easter morning he broke the back of the devil and he says Easter means to bring back and he says because the Bible says because I live ye shall live also so Easter's a proclamation that the image that God had of your mind of you and his mind Easter brings you back to that image of perfection brother brandom says Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the D Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus coat stiff dead in the grave shaken the life rise again and roll away the stone and he would say this she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as as men and women are one the woman taken from his side she taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side May both the mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him put it together made Dynam made mechanics and Dynamics he says Easter made the body of Jesus that was dead stiff cold shaken the life and rise again and so has this this bride coming of Christ that was dead stiff and cold but this second Easter has pulled her out brother the brandom said what an Easter that was what an Easter this is amen thankful for that this evening what are you playing Sister Mary can we just sing that song brother the world call me out on oh how I love him oh how I love [Music] him how I adore him my PR my [Music] sunshine my all and all the great [Music] Creator became my [Music] savior and all God's [Music] fullness dwell in him

great [Music] Creator Be My Savior and God's fullness dwell it what a beautiful message tonight deity deity in you it's it's God's presence in you that's just such an incredible thing it was it was the god of Heaven wanting to become a man so that he could know what you felt like but also so that you could know what he felt like that's deity that really struck me he he don't want you to see him as a Creed a tradition a law he wants to see you as a very living loving father that loves you what a what an incredible thought that was tonight oh how I love him I guess everyone's preaching Easter messages around the country but to know that he lives in me brother Ken as he shook my hand this morning at the door man he says Christ Jesus lives he lives My Savior Lives something like that and um he telling me his testimony this morning and said he was he was um uh there at the the back and his his eye was you know he was seeing different colors and when he'd look around just the colors and it and it brought fear in his eye fear in his heart because he had had that retina detached before and he knows what all those colors mean and knows it and it bothered him and and then about the same time brother murl was saying that he was going he wanted to sing another song the song that he sung tonight and he says but I just feel that I I need to sing we just need to sing Amazing Grace well well brother Ken was saying as as he begin to sing Amazing Grace and just put his confidence in the Lord and just letting God know how much he loved him he said then the Lord just come in and just totally heal that all of that left Hallelujah that's a he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today walks with me he talks with me all along life's narrow way aren't you glad that he know that you know that he lives that he wants to Oh my he he he wants to walk with you man and so I I appreciated that testimony and I I just thought it was so unique because brother Merl was going to sing a totally different song and then the Lord put something on his heart so so to see do do you see how deity is Among Us and how that we it's so important for us to just really be sensitive to the Lord in those in those times and so we say a big win for God and a big loss for the devil and I'm glad we're on the Winning Side amen yes and uh and so we're just we're just so thankful he is alive amen and and there was a song um uh um that that our brother brought that that he uh they sing there's a song they used to sing blacks and black folks used to sing Jesus is Alive and Well and uh uh uh but let's

brother Kobe brother Michael and brother Caleb and I know there's some women here in the building that really do miss them and uh a whole bunch and and um um what had happened was uh they they just needed they didn't have enough counselors there in Louisiana and um so they put out a memo uh uh saying listen we're in trouble we can't have we can't have Youth Camp here in a couple of days if we can't find counselors and um and so uh all four of the boys uh volunteered just right away said they would go down there Josh was going to go and um and and um and Fresco was going to ride down there with the boys and Josh and Loretta was going to meet them they in Louisiana and then Fresco was going to ride back with Loretta because there was no place for Loretta to stay over there and um and so I felt that I when the funeral thing came up I I felt that Fresca needed to be with us over there in Arkansas and so um so Josh and Loretta just came straight on this way here and and um I believe the Lord just worked it all out in that way and so uh because we wouldn't have got a good message tonight like that if uh or that good message anyways amen the Lord just ordained that and so we're so thankful for that and um and so uh uh uh we want let let's just pray for those guys cuz I promise you they have not been sleeping and uh not they don't you don't you don't sleep at camp and so it's only been a few weeks since ours and and we put all of that energy in it and then and then those guys are are volunteered to do it all over again and um it is work it is work and so uh we we pray for
