[48:05] come and be a part of it amen we sure
[48:07] thank the Lord for what he's doing there
[48:09] as well and amen tonight we want to look
[48:11] here in the book of St John the 15th
[48:13] chapter and I want to read out of the
[48:15] fifth verse of St John 15:5 it's a very
[48:18] familiar reading Jesus here speaking he
[48:21] says I am the vine and ye are the
[48:24] branches
[48:26] now he that abideth in me and I in him
[48:30] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[48:33] without me ye can do nothing amen
[48:39] without me you can do nothing but then
[48:41] you skip down the 15th verse and he says
[48:43] now henceforth I call you not servants
[48:45] for the servant knoweth not what his
[48:47] Lord doeth but I have called you friends
[48:50] for all things that I have heard of my
[48:52] father I have made known unto you you
[48:56] amen now ye have not chosen me but I
[49:00] have chosen you and ordained you that ye
[49:04] should go forth and bring forth fruit
[49:06] and that your fruit should remain and
[49:08] that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[49:11] father in my name he may give it unto
[49:14] you now in the book of Acts the 2
[49:17] chapter acts the 2 chapter we want to
[49:20] look in the first verse it's another a
[49:22] very familiar reading to us it's the
[49:24] scripture speaking to us about what
[49:26] happened there on the day of
[49:29] Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 and verse
[49:32] number one you love the Lord this
[49:35] evening the Bible says and when the day
[49:38] of Pentecost was fully come they were
[49:42] all with one Accord somebody say one
[49:44] Accord one Accord in one place and
[49:48] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[49:51] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[49:54] filled all the the house where they were
[49:57] sitting amen let's just bow our hearts
[50:00] together tonight Heavenly Father Lord as
[50:02] we have read your word we believe that
[50:04] you are in your word now father we're
[50:06] asking you to come into this meeting
[50:08] tonight in a special way by your mercy
[50:10] and Grace Lord you see the needs of your
[50:12] children here tonight there's no way
[50:14] that I as a man Lord could minister to
[50:17] every need but Lord I know that if I can
[50:19] get myself out of the way and surrender
[50:21] to you Lord then you can take that that
[50:24] gift that you play in my life and Lord
[50:26] you can control it and you can operate
[50:28] it Lord I pray God that you would send
[50:30] the spirit of Liberty into the building
[50:32] tonight father may you not just anoint
[50:34] me to speak your word but may you anoint
[50:36] the children of God to pull and Lord to
[50:39] receive from your word and Lord may we
[50:41] not leave here the same as we came
[50:43] father but Lord may we leave here change
[50:45] may we leave here Lord with a deeper
[50:48] understanding with a greater love and a
[50:50] greater determination than ever to serve
[50:52] you and to walk in your ways Lord we ask
[50:55] your mercy and Grace Upon Our Lives now
[50:57] father we commit this meeting in your
[50:59] hands have your way Among Us in Jesus
[51:01] Christ's name we pray and all the
[51:03] Believers
[51:04] says amen and amen God bless you tonight
[51:08] as you can have your seats here amen I
[51:10] want to by the help of the Lord for just
[51:12] a few moments tonight to speak to you on
[51:14] this thought here amen I want to speak
[51:16] to you on the power of Harmony amen the
[51:19] power of Harmony brother Bram speaking
[51:21] here and I'm drawing my thought from a
[51:23] couple quotes brother Bram heing
[51:24] question ansers 54 he says now the main
[51:27] thing above everything is to keep the
[51:30] church in Harmony and in love of God and
[51:32] moving on if we can all believe that the
[51:35] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[51:37] all sin and unrighteousness he said then
[51:39] if the woman sitting next to you or the
[51:41] man sitting next to you if he doesn't
[51:43] believe that Jesus will actually come
[51:45] visibly again he said well let's just
[51:47] believe it and go right ahead anyhow he
[51:50] said we don't agree with him on the
[51:51] scripture amen but let's make the church
[51:54] move on for Harmon Harmony because in
[51:56] there he says we're going to catch some
[51:58] more people but when the church is out
[52:01] of Harmony he said then you hurt the
[52:04] church you hurt the cost amen so Harmony
[52:07] has the ability Amen to bring more
[52:10] people in it has the ability to actually
[52:12] catch people or to reach people amen
[52:14] when the church is in harmony again he
[52:17] said spiritual experiences I believe
[52:19] that everything Amen in the natural line
[52:21] Works in harmony or should with the
[52:23] spiritual in the side man brother said
[52:26] let your faith just meet that condition
[52:28] and it will be for thou has said as thou
[52:31] has believed in thy heart amen so shall
[52:33] it be he said and I pray that you'll
[52:35] grant that tonight and make the whole
[52:37] atmosphere here Lord make it a creative
[52:40] atmosphere of one soul of one mind of
[52:43] one Accord and one purpose amen Lord
[52:46] make the whole atmosphere here A
[52:48] Creative atmosphere amen of one soul and
[52:51] one mind of one Accord and one purpose
[52:54] again the uncertain s he said now this
[52:56] person amen what if you could ever get
[52:58] this Soul on the inside amen soul in
[53:01] harmony with God Amen that your soul and
[53:04] God would be one together think about
[53:06] that that if you could ever get your
[53:08] soul on the inside amen soul in harmony
[53:11] with God Amen that your soul and God
[53:14] would be one together then you could ask
[53:16] what you will and it shall be given unto
[53:19] you now amen I believe that God Amen
[53:22] desires Harmony in the church I believe
[53:24] that I believe that amen above anything
[53:27] God wants to see amen the Spirit of
[53:30] Harmony working in the church now you
[53:31] all know amen that Lucifer hates Harmony
[53:35] as a matter of fact he is the enemy of
[53:37] Harmony and he will do anything he can
[53:40] Amen to see that the harmony is broken
[53:42] amen because Lucifer will use Discord
[53:45] Amen to break up the harmony now the
[53:47] Bible tells us in Proverbs 16 or 6:19
[53:51] that a that the Lord hates seven things
[53:53] amen and one of those things is is he
[53:56] amen that Seth Discord among the
[53:58] Brethren now that word Discord is Strife
[54:00] or contention and the prophet said one
[54:02] thing God hates is sowing Discord amen
[54:05] among the Brethren he said in them the
[54:07] organizations is what does it see amen
[54:10] it shows Discord among the brethren we
[54:13] should be standing in the breach and
[54:15] saying amen we are brothers another
[54:19] place he says I believe in the
[54:21] fatherhood of God Amen and the
[54:23] Brotherhood of Man how many can say I
[54:25] believe in the fatherhood of God Amen
[54:27] and the Brotherhood of Man he said I
[54:29] think that we're brothers together and
[54:31] that's way we should be and God has his
[54:33] children now maybe some of them are a
[54:36] little odd to our belief or your belief
[54:38] or mine amen but God is accepting his
[54:41] children amen so we have to accept them
[54:44] as our brothers and our sisters amen
[54:47] that's right now think about that amen
[54:49] there's people that you don't accept and
[54:51] there's people that I wouldn't accept
[54:53] because of certain ways or person alties
[54:55] or amen human nature but but the thing
[54:57] about it is amen if it wasn't for the
[55:00] grace of God Amen then none of us would
[55:02] have been accepted amen but God who
[55:05] looks beyond all of our faults and all
[55:07] of our failures and all of our
[55:09] peculiarity amen Our God has already
[55:12] accepted us amen as his sons and
[55:14] daughters so if God Amen has accepted
[55:17] the person sitting next to you amen as
[55:19] his son or his daughter amen I think you
[55:22] all accept him as your brother amen
[55:24] accept him as your sister come on church
[55:27] amen because there's one thing the devil
[55:28] don't want is he don't want the Harmony
[55:31] and the unity of God Amen coming into
[55:33] the church now many people they think
[55:35] well you know we're so deep and we're so
[55:38] revelated and we got so much Revelation
[55:40] that it's almost it's almost childish
[55:42] you know to preach on Harmony or Unity
[55:44] but I believe amen that no matter how
[55:46] deep we've gotten in Revelation we're
[55:48] not Beyond amen keeping the spirit of
[55:51] unity Amen in Harmony in the Church of
[55:54] the Living God now the Propet of God
[55:55] says it like this amen he said in the
[55:57] fourth dimension I I want you to hear
[55:59] this quote because I believe amen that
[56:02] Harmony is more important than we
[56:03] realize I believe amen that we must be
[56:06] in harmony or in tune with God Amen in
[56:09] order to declare the supernatural do you
[56:12] realize that we are here Amen to declare
[56:15] the supernatural how many agree we are
[56:17] here to declare the supernatural now do
[56:20] you realize if Harmony and unity is
[56:22] broken amen the supernatural will not be
[56:25] declared amen then the church will
[56:27] become a natural church amen but we're
[56:30] there there's aund natural churches
[56:32] around friends amen but we're here Amen
[56:34] to be a supernatural church amen a
[56:37] lighthouse amen a living witness amen
[56:40] that the god of history is no longer
[56:42] historical God Amen but he is a living
[56:45] God and he's moving in his church and
[56:47] he's delivering
[56:49] people he's saving Souls he's healing
[56:52] bodies he's not a dead historical God
[56:55] he's a living God and he still works the
[56:58] supernatural now the prophet of God said
[57:00] in the fourth dimension he said people
[57:03] can prove right through this room now
[57:05] amen is coming radio activity radio
[57:07] messages amen coming right through this
[57:09] building now is coming television
[57:11] pictures amen but it's too fast for our
[57:14] eyes he said now you go a millions of
[57:16] miles beyond that Dimension and you'll
[57:19] get into a place that's just as real as
[57:21] television pictures is in this room this
[57:23] morning he said now theirs the Lord
[57:25] Jesus
[57:27] Christ he says the resurrected Son of
[57:30] God standing here and that's the reason
[57:32] you can't see him is because your heart
[57:36] hasn't become tuned down to it think
[57:38] about that God is in this building right
[57:41] here tonight he said but you can't see
[57:43] him because our heart hasn't become
[57:45] tuned down to it he said that's the
[57:47] reason that we cannot see television
[57:49] pictures amen is our bodies are not set
[57:52] as instruments Amen to pick up
[57:54] mechanical sent things but when our body
[57:57] becomes in tune with God becoming a part
[58:00] of him then our soul can pick up the
[58:02] power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate
[58:05] the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[58:07] all of his power and amance he has risen
[58:10] from the dead he lives Among Us he wants
[58:13] Fellowship back with his people again
[58:15] his majesty his glory is now spreading
[58:18] forth amen he's Desiring to Fellowship
[58:21] again amen with his people like he did
[58:24] in the garden of leading amen now let me
[58:26] say this the fall in the garden amen man
[58:29] got out of tune with God right amen the
[58:31] fall in the garden man got out of tune
[58:33] with God Amen and Harmony was broken now
[58:36] do you realize when Harmony is broken
[58:38] there are repercussions the prophet of
[58:40] God tells us that amen there when he was
[58:42] sent among the Pentecostals he said my
[58:44] my mother-in-law said you're not taking
[58:46] my daughter amen down there among that
[58:48] trash and he said well he said she's my
[58:51] wife and and she said well she's my
[58:53] daughter he said now listen I listen to
[58:55] the woman amen instead of listening to
[58:57] God and he said then sorrow set in
[59:00] immediately he said the 1937 foot came
[59:03] Sorrows begin to break in things went
[59:05] wrong at the church he said the
[59:07] congregation begin to drop amen just get
[59:09] out of Harmony One Time amen with God he
[59:13] said in friends I'll always regret it
[59:15] amen as long as I live amen now let me
[59:18] say this that was the same spirit amen
[59:21] that mored in the Garden of Eden Amen to
[59:23] cause Harmony to be broken there amen
[59:25] was still trying to break up Harmony
[59:28] amen because when man is Out Of Tune
[59:30] with God and he's out of harmony with
[59:32] God he cannot declare the supernatural
[59:35] he cannot confess the promises of God
[59:38] Amen but God by the new birth amen and
[59:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen has
[59:43] made a way amen that Harmony could be
[59:46] restored he said the new birth is an
[59:48] experience see it's a gift of God it's
[59:50] the Seal of your faith amen and we
[59:53] believe him then if you say you believe
[59:55] and do not receive the Holy Spirit then
[59:57] you do not believe because God promised
[59:59] to give you amen the Holy Spirit when
[1:00:02] you did believe amen now watch when the
[1:00:04] spirit of God Amen comes into a man it
[1:00:07] quickens him and then he becomes a new
[1:00:10] creature he believes in the immortal God
[1:00:13] he believes that he does all things amen
[1:00:15] and his heart is in tune with God when a
[1:00:18] man gets born again amen and receives
[1:00:21] the Seal of God Amen that automatically
[1:00:24] put his heart Amen in tune with God and
[1:00:27] he becomes a new creature and he can
[1:00:29] declare things that the man that has not
[1:00:32] been born again cannot declare amen all
[1:00:34] that a unborn man can declare amen is
[1:00:37] the five senses of the Inner Man and the
[1:00:39] outer man amen but God by the new birth
[1:00:43] amen has regenerated you and has called
[1:00:45] you to declare things amen not by SE not
[1:00:48] by smell not by feel or imagination but
[1:00:51] you've been called to declare things
[1:00:53] amen by the six sense which is the super
[1:00:56] sense and it'll call everything else
[1:00:58] contrary Amen to the word of God let me
[1:01:01] say this no matter what happens in your
[1:01:03] life no matter what trials you go
[1:01:05] through no matter what disappointment
[1:01:07] you face don't you ever let your heart
[1:01:10] get out of tune with
[1:01:12] god brother God said no matter what you
[1:01:14] got here in this world what you haven't
[1:01:16] got you keep your heart right in tune
[1:01:19] with God Amen everything all your houses
[1:01:21] lands all your money all your sickness
[1:01:24] all your Health all your children
[1:01:25] everything you've got here on this Earth
[1:01:27] everything will leave you and it'll go
[1:01:30] right straight back to the beginning
[1:01:31] again but if that heart is right with
[1:01:34] God you'll come forth again as
[1:01:37] certain as there is a God in heaven but
[1:01:40] if it's not right with God you've got to
[1:01:42] take the other route amen I find it
[1:01:45] amazing amen the promt of God has ask a
[1:01:47] question one time in question answers
[1:01:49] they said brother brandom why would
[1:01:51] Christ amen appear to me as I was about
[1:01:54] to take the sacraments now they're
[1:01:55] having communion and here the prophet of
[1:01:58] God says amen that somebody asked him
[1:02:00] why that Christ would appear he said
[1:02:02] well no doubt amen that your heart was
[1:02:05] just in tune amen and as you were coming
[1:02:08] sacredly up to God that's why he
[1:02:11] appeared to you amen if your heart is in
[1:02:13] tune with God it has the ability Amen to
[1:02:17] bring the Unseen into the scene amen and
[1:02:20] Christ can appear to you and he can
[1:02:22] change you he can bless you amen because
[1:02:25] why your heart is in harmony with God
[1:02:28] now when you look at this word harmony
[1:02:30] what it means is the combination amen of
[1:02:32] simultaneously sounded musical notes
[1:02:35] Amen to produce chords amen and chord
[1:02:38] progressions having a pleasing effect
[1:02:40] amen the quality of forming a pleasing
[1:02:43] and consistent hold amen Harmony is very
[1:02:46] important in musical Productions amen
[1:02:48] because the purpose of music is to
[1:02:51] display the ability of Harmony amen and
[1:02:54] in other words Harmony has the ability
[1:02:56] to bring everybody on the same page amen
[1:02:59] singing the same song playing the same
[1:03:01] chord amen and it's not having an
[1:03:03] unpleasing effect but it's having a
[1:03:05] pleasing effect and as Harmony is coming
[1:03:08] in the church amen the church is
[1:03:10] progressing amen by the harmony it's
[1:03:13] being given to the church now the Bible
[1:03:15] says in John 5 amen that Jesus cured an
[1:03:18] impotent man amen at the pool of beesa
[1:03:20] y'all remember that amen and the Bible
[1:03:22] says that he did that on the Sabbath day
[1:03:24] and when he did that the Jews amen rose
[1:03:27] up to persecute Jesus and they sought to
[1:03:29] slay him because he had done these
[1:03:32] things on the Sabbath day and Jesus said
[1:03:34] my father worketh hitherto and I work
[1:03:36] now therefore the Jews sought the more
[1:03:38] to kill him because he not only had
[1:03:40] broken the Sabbath but said also that
[1:03:43] God was his father amen making himself
[1:03:46] equal with God the Bible says in St John
[1:03:49] 5:19 verily verily I say unto you amen
[1:03:52] the son can do nothing of himself
[1:03:55] but what he sees the father do for what
[1:03:58] things soever he doeth amen these also
[1:04:01] doeth the son likewise said now knowest
[1:04:04] all things he said when he passed by the
[1:04:06] pool and he seen all the people and he
[1:04:09] healed a man amen the Jews question him
[1:04:12] why he said I do nothing amen but what
[1:04:14] the father shows me I can't do nothing
[1:04:17] but whatever he does he shows me and
[1:04:19] then I go do it he said now we notice
[1:04:22] here he was a kind man was a humble man
[1:04:25] amen but yet he was a man of power how
[1:04:28] many believes that Jesus was a kind man
[1:04:30] you believe he was a humble man do you
[1:04:32] believe he was a man of power amen when
[1:04:35] he spoke he was very humble and gentle
[1:04:37] but when it come time Amen to separate
[1:04:40] the truth from the error amen then Jesus
[1:04:42] was very Stern he picked up some ropes
[1:04:45] and tied them together kicked over the
[1:04:47] money Chargers table and beat them out
[1:04:49] of the temple and called the Pharisees
[1:04:51] those religious people a bunch of
[1:04:53] Hypocrites and serpents and Snakes in
[1:04:55] the Grass amen see he was a man amen who
[1:04:58] could speak when it come time to speak
[1:05:00] he was a man who was full of love amen
[1:05:03] but I want you to catch this church he
[1:05:05] loved his father so much amen till he
[1:05:08] stayed in harmony with his father and
[1:05:10] anything that interfered with the
[1:05:13] harmony amen that's where Jesus draw the
[1:05:15] line amen he was a man of love he was a
[1:05:19] man of power he was a gentle man he was
[1:05:21] a humble man but anything that Rose up
[1:05:24] Amen to break the harmony between him
[1:05:27] and his father amen Jesus drew the line
[1:05:30] and said that's as far as you're going
[1:05:31] to go listen amen as long as they were
[1:05:34] saying what they wanted to doing what
[1:05:35] they wanted to he just went right on
[1:05:38] Amen but when they brought their
[1:05:39] nonsense in the house of God Amen and
[1:05:42] turned the House of Prayer into the
[1:05:44] house of money and thieves he said
[1:05:45] that's as far as you're going to go and
[1:05:47] he drew the line and he kept the harmony
[1:05:50] amen between him and his father listen
[1:05:53] friends I believe believe that we
[1:05:54] received a prophet in this generation
[1:05:57] amen with the same Ministry of Jesus
[1:05:59] Christ and watch a Vindicated Prophet
[1:06:01] the only thing I'm here for is to follow
[1:06:04] the instructions of my brothers amen as
[1:06:06] long as it doesn't interfere amen with
[1:06:09] the things that God has for me to do
[1:06:12] listen I think that ought to be where
[1:06:14] you draw the line too is anything that
[1:06:16] breaks the harmony between you and your
[1:06:19] father ought to be the place you draw
[1:06:21] the line and say the spirit will not
[1:06:23] have any more leeway we will not give
[1:06:25] him any more room we will not give him
[1:06:27] any more air amen we're going to stop
[1:06:29] this thing somewhere because we're not
[1:06:32] getting out of
[1:06:34] harmony with our father now when you
[1:06:36] look at this word interfere it means to
[1:06:39] take part or to intervene in an activity
[1:06:42] without invitation or necessity it is to
[1:06:45] prevent a process or activity from
[1:06:47] continuing or being carried out properly
[1:06:50] it is of a Fame to strike against
[1:06:52] something when working it is to get in

[1:09:35] of the sons of God Amen but Christians
[1:09:38] always overcome amen Christians always
[1:09:41] overcome because God wants to display
[1:09:45] his power he said now look all the
[1:09:47] Babylon and Hell could not defeat that
[1:09:49] purpose no matter if I could he that
[1:09:51] furnace a million times hotter it would
[1:09:53] have never destroyed the purpose of God
[1:09:56] because God wanted to show that he was
[1:09:58] the god of Deliverance and he would
[1:10:00] bring a Deliverance to whomever he
[1:10:02] desired to bring it amen and nothing
[1:10:04] would interfere with his program let me
[1:10:07] say this to you friends the same Harmony
[1:10:09] that was between the father and the son
[1:10:12] has now come into existence between the
[1:10:14] bride and the groom and the prophet said
[1:10:17] the harmony now to exist between the
[1:10:18] groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:10:20] word of life and she receives it she
[1:10:23] never it amen therefore nothing can harm
[1:10:26] her not even death for if the seed be
[1:10:29] planted amen the water will raise it up
[1:10:32] again here is the secret of this amen
[1:10:34] the word is in the bride amen the word
[1:10:38] is in the bride as it was in Mary amen
[1:10:41] and the bride has the mind of Christ for
[1:10:43] she knows what he wants done with his
[1:10:46] word she performs the command of his
[1:10:48] word in his name for she has thus saith
[1:10:52] the Lord then the word is quickened by
[1:10:54] the spirit and comes to pass amen like a
[1:10:57] seed that is planted in water it comes
[1:11:00] to full Harvest amen serving its purpose
[1:11:03] amen let me say this every devil in hell
[1:11:06] is trying to interfere between you and
[1:11:08] your father because he knows that you're
[1:11:10] not on the Earth by accident you are on
[1:11:13] the earth for a purpose and the devil's
[1:11:15] trying to defeat you in that purpose
[1:11:17] amen but I want to say nothing amen will
[1:11:20] defeat the purpose of God Amen sickness
[1:11:22] will not defeat it Church trouble will
[1:11:24] not defeat it criticism will not defeat
[1:11:27] it Skeptics will not defeat it amen God
[1:11:30] will bring his purpose into fruition and
[1:11:32] there ain't enough devils in hell to
[1:11:33] defeat God Amen in doing what God wants
[1:11:36] to do in the age he wants to do it in
[1:11:39] now I say this I believe we're on the
[1:11:40] earth for more amen than just to serve a
[1:11:43] just to serve a career or to serve an
[1:11:45] education but I believe God has brought
[1:11:47] us on the earth amen and we are here
[1:11:50] Amen to be fruit bearers and
[1:11:52] lightbearers
[1:11:54] the Bible said we are God's fruit
[1:11:56] bearers the prophet of God brings that
[1:11:58] from John 15 and said ye are the
[1:12:00] branches he said now the vine puts forth
[1:12:03] the fruit but the branches has to Bear
[1:12:05] the
[1:12:06] fruit if the branch is getting its life
[1:12:09] out of the vine well it's the same kind
[1:12:11] of life that's in the vine don't you
[1:12:13] think so it has to be now he says our
[1:12:17] hands and our lips and our eyes he said
[1:12:20] them God's hands lips and eyes that we
[1:12:22] have here he has has on earth now he's
[1:12:25] gone back to God Amen to send forth his
[1:12:28] energy of his spirit amen to anoint us
[1:12:31] with a holy spirit then if we are
[1:12:33] submissive to him amen that our hands
[1:12:36] represent his hands amen that's the
[1:12:38] reason he said amen they shall lay hands
[1:12:40] on the sick and they shall recover the
[1:12:43] church is the fruit bearers today he
[1:12:46] said my hand is his hand your hand is
[1:12:49] his hand your eyes and my eyes is his
[1:12:51] eyes he just uses us us amen as yielded
[1:12:55] branches we are the fruit bearers on the
[1:12:58] earth amen bearing the fruit of the
[1:13:00] brine right in John or rather in Matthew
[1:13:03] 5:14 the Bible said ye are the light of
[1:13:05] the world you are a city that is set on
[1:13:08] a hill and cannot be hid it says neither
[1:13:11] do men light a candle and put it under a
[1:13:13] bushel or on a Candlestick and give a
[1:13:15] light unto all that's in the house so
[1:13:17] let your light shine before men amen
[1:13:20] that they may see your good works amen
[1:13:23] and glorify your father which is in
[1:13:25] heaven listen to The Prophet's prayer he
[1:13:27] said we thank thee to be lightbearers of
[1:13:30] this age to be ready Amen to manifest
[1:13:33] the promised word for the age that we're
[1:13:35] now living in amen knowing that in the
[1:13:37] beginning you allotted your word knowing
[1:13:39] the end from the beginning each age you
[1:13:41] allotted your word to that age and
[1:13:43] somehow we don't know how it ever
[1:13:46] happened but in each one of those ages
[1:13:48] as we look back upon the word amen we
[1:13:50] see that there was an anointing come in
[1:13:53] in that age amen that fulfilled the word
[1:13:56] amen and in the last days we're now
[1:13:57] living in there is a lotted word a
[1:14:00] promise for this age he said we believe
[1:14:02] that the holy spirit amen is here on the
[1:14:05] earth now amen trying to find Hearts
[1:14:08] Amen to manifest and to bring to pass by
[1:14:11] vindicating the word that is now been
[1:14:13] prophesied for this day in this hour
[1:14:16] listen if we have the word without the
[1:14:18] anointing the purpose will never be
[1:14:20] fulfilled it takes the anointing amen is
[1:14:23] it okay to preach it takes the anointing
[1:14:26] Amen to come upon the word amen to
[1:14:28] fulfill the word in the season that God
[1:14:31] has allotted that word to be fulfilled
[1:14:33] in that I say tonight I still believe in
[1:14:35] the anointing I believe in the anointing
[1:14:37] of Isaiah 10 that said the Yoke shall be
[1:14:40] destroyed amen because of the anointing
[1:14:43] I'm going to ask you a question if you
[1:14:45] got tired amen of living under that yoke
[1:14:47] amen are you tired of living under that
[1:14:49] yoke of depression that yoke of
[1:14:51] criticism that yoke of this and that
[1:14:54] amen are you ready to let the anointing
[1:14:56] amen come in the building and destroy
[1:14:58] that thing come on church I think we
[1:15:00] ought to I don't think we ought to get
[1:15:02] free on Sunday and be bound get on
[1:15:04] Wednesday I don't think we ought to get
[1:15:05] free on Wednesday and be bound get on
[1:15:07] Sunday I believe if the anointing ever
[1:15:10] breaks out in the church it will not
[1:15:12] break the Yoke it will destroy the
[1:15:15] Yoke and the Bible said the Yoke shall
[1:15:18] be destroyed amen because of the
[1:15:21] anointing amen I believe it I believe
[1:15:23] the True Believers is here on the earth
[1:15:25] amen and I believe you're here Amen to
[1:15:27] fulfill the word I believe that I
[1:15:29] believe you are here on the earth Amen
[1:15:31] to fulfill the word of God I believe
[1:15:34] with all my heart amen I believe that
[1:15:36] you are a part amen of God and the
[1:15:38] prophet of God said now when God comes
[1:15:40] in the inner part of a man in the inner
[1:15:42] part of a man he said a man is made up
[1:15:44] in the system of a Tabernacle in the
[1:15:47] outer courts then the holy place and the
[1:15:50] holies of holies see the Shak of Glory
[1:15:53] on the inside of the veil do you all
[1:15:55] realize the Bible says that there is an
[1:15:57] old man and there is a new man amen and
[1:16:00] the old man amen has got to die so that
[1:16:03] the new man can come into manifestation
[1:16:05] in Romans 6:6 the Bible said knowing
[1:16:08] this that our old man is crucified with
[1:16:11] him that the body of sin amen might be
[1:16:14] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[1:16:17] serve sin in Ephesians 2:14 for he is
[1:16:20] our peace who ha made both one and has
[1:16:23] broken down the middle wall of petition
[1:16:25] between us having abolished in the flesh
[1:16:28] amen the enmity even the law of
[1:16:30] Commandments amen contained in
[1:16:32] ordinances amen for to make in himself
[1:16:34] of Twain one new man amen so making
[1:16:38] peace that he might reconcile both unto
[1:16:40] God in one body by the cross having
[1:16:43] slain the enmity thereby in Ephesians
[1:16:46] 3:16 that we would Grant unto you
[1:16:48] according to the riches of his glory
[1:16:50] amen to be strengthened amen with the
[1:16:52] might by his his spirit in the Inner Man
[1:16:55] in Ephesians 2 or 4:22 that you put off
[1:16:58] concerning the former conversation amen
[1:17:00] the old man which is corrupt according
[1:17:03] to the deceitfulness of lust and be
[1:17:05] renewed in the spirit of your mind that
[1:17:07] you may put on the new man which is
[1:17:10] after God Amen created in righteousness
[1:17:13] and true Holiness in 2 Corinthians 4:16
[1:17:17] for which cause we think not amen but
[1:17:19] though our outward man perish amen yet
[1:17:21] the inward man is renewed amen day by
[1:17:25] day amen your outward man is getting
[1:17:27] weaker your outward man is getting older
[1:17:29] your outward man is getting more
[1:17:31] wrinkles and more gray hair amen and
[1:17:33] more sicknesses amen but there is a man
[1:17:35] on the inside amen that's getting
[1:17:38] stronger and he's getting stronger come
[1:17:40] on church this message has come in this
[1:17:42] generation Amen to weaken your flesh
[1:17:45] amen and to strengthen your soul your
[1:17:47] flesh is the enemy of God your flesh is
[1:17:49] what don't want you to praise your flesh
[1:17:51] is what don't want you to say Amen man
[1:17:53] it's your flesh that don't want you Amen
[1:17:55] to pull on the word of God it's your
[1:17:57] flesh that says I'm too tired to go to
[1:17:59] church I'm too tired to pray I'm too
[1:18:01] tired to fast amen that is your flesh
[1:18:04] amen but there's an inward man on the
[1:18:06] inside of you listen and if you left the
[1:18:08] inward man raise up he will crucify the
[1:18:11] outward man and there will be a
[1:18:13] resurrection amen a strength and power
[1:18:16] and human ability will vanish and the
[1:18:18] Divine ability of God will come into
[1:18:21] operation in your soul by the baptism of
[1:18:24] the Holy Ghost listen I believe it I
[1:18:26] believe this message amen has come to
[1:18:28] weaken your
[1:18:30] flesh want me prove it to you amen have
[1:18:32] you ever sit down and read Luke the
[1:18:34] first chapter amen where the Bible talks
[1:18:36] about Mary amen the angel come to Mary
[1:18:39] and the prophet of God said she received
[1:18:40] a hard message brother John he said that
[1:18:42] was a message that nobody ever heard
[1:18:45] amen that a virgin's going to bring
[1:18:46] forth the son now if you go read Luke 1
[1:18:49] you will see that the angel appears to
[1:18:51] Mary amen and begins to to talk to Mary
[1:18:54] and as the angel begins to talk amen the
[1:18:56] human flesh of Mary begins to say some
[1:18:58] words like this amen how can this
[1:19:02] be amen who's going to bring this to
[1:19:05] pass a are you hearing me amen what is
[1:19:07] going on here amen but every question
[1:19:10] she
[1:19:11] asked the angel had an answer and he
[1:19:14] just kept on delivering the message he
[1:19:16] kept on delivering the message he kept
[1:19:18] on delivering the message until when the
[1:19:20] angel got done delivering the message
[1:19:23] amen the message of the angel had so
[1:19:25] defeated the Flesh of Mary amen that all
[1:19:28] she could say was be it unto me Lord
[1:19:31] according to Thy word I don't know how
[1:19:33] it's going to happen I don't know when
[1:19:35] it's going to happen amen but if this
[1:19:37] Angel's message is true that he will
[1:19:40] come on church and we have received the
[1:19:42] message of the Angel of the Lord and he
[1:19:45] said there's going to be a Rapture
[1:19:46] there's going to be a resurrection
[1:19:48] there's going to be a body change how's
[1:19:50] it going to happen I don't know but when
[1:19:52] the angel got done preaching to me all I
[1:19:55] could say was be it unto me Lord
[1:19:58] according to Thy word are you hearing me
[1:20:01] when you get done hearing a tape it
[1:20:03] ought to rob you of human ability and
[1:20:05] release the Divine ability every's tape
[1:20:08] you listen to it ought to make your
[1:20:10] flesh so weak that your flesh can't
[1:20:12] argue with a word it can't argue with a
[1:20:14] promise but all your soul can say is be
[1:20:18] it unto
[1:20:21] me according in to Thy word the outward
[1:20:26] man is perishing but the inward man is
[1:20:28] renewed look at Colossians 3:9 lie not
[1:20:31] one to another seeing that you have put
[1:20:34] off the old man with his deeds and have
[1:20:37] put on the new man which is renewed in
[1:20:40] knowledge after the image of him that
[1:20:43] created him now I believe this anointing
[1:20:46] is not striking just the outside man I
[1:20:49] believe it's striking the Inside Man the
[1:20:52] prod of God says it like this did you
[1:20:54] know that there's another man on the
[1:20:55] inside of your body and that's a spirit
[1:20:58] man see that's right that's now how this
[1:21:01] is here the inside man he said now this
[1:21:04] Inside Man if it is of god it's the
[1:21:06] spirit of God that's inside our being
[1:21:08] now my finger could not move without
[1:21:10] something to make it move it works from
[1:21:12] an intelligent amen here that the Mind
[1:21:15] subconsciously just maybe if it happened
[1:21:17] to think to reach over here I don't have
[1:21:19] to think about it now there's where
[1:21:21] Faith lays so here the the prophet
[1:21:23] breaks it down and said there's a
[1:21:25] conscience and there's a subconscious he
[1:21:27] said if we start overseas by ship he
[1:21:29] said there's a man sitting a here he's
[1:21:31] the one who gives the orders he said the
[1:21:33] man goes down in the ship to run the
[1:21:35] ship down here well he don't see where
[1:21:36] he's going but he just takes orders from
[1:21:38] up above well now he says steer to the
[1:21:40] left or to the right give this engine
[1:21:42] more and that or whatever it is he just
[1:21:44] works by orders but way down in the
[1:21:47] midst of us here in our heart is the
[1:21:49] subconscious and it takes orders from up
[1:21:51] here well now you've heard me on the
[1:21:53] platform many times no doubt I was just
[1:21:55] hearing a tape from the Owensburg
[1:21:56] meeting the other day he said about a
[1:21:58] person who was crippled was healed how
[1:22:00] it was speaking how the Holy Spirit was
[1:22:02] speaking now up here this conscience
[1:22:04] comes up to that platform brother
[1:22:06] Brandon praise the Lord I have faith but
[1:22:08] right down there in that other little
[1:22:09] conscience said now you know you haven't
[1:22:11] see well now if you act if you can get
[1:22:13] this one and that one in harmony with
[1:22:15] that one amen this one saying yes all
[1:22:18] the time this one saying yes amen but
[1:22:21] way down and there something's little
[1:22:22] fell just out see you want to make it
[1:22:24] you want to say yes but it's just down
[1:22:26] there that little shadow that makes you
[1:22:28] and don't deal with this little fell
[1:22:30] down here very much well you'll find out
[1:22:32] he just kindly does the ruling you
[1:22:34] see after all he's the one who drives
[1:22:38] the ship see he's the one who does the
[1:22:40] steering this one might say a lot this
[1:22:42] guy that does the work down here see so
[1:22:44] this one right here say oh yes I believe
[1:22:46] that oh I sure do well if that's right
[1:22:48] this and disagree with that then we've
[1:22:50] got it see then it'll have to work but
[1:22:52] but until that does it well it just
[1:22:54] won't work that's all because you got
[1:22:56] orders going this way and this one going
[1:22:59] this way and there's just pulling your
[1:23:00] ship one way and you don't get out of
[1:23:02] the harbor amen so get these fellas to
[1:23:04] agreeing and saying God Is Right amen
[1:23:07] this says God is right this says God Is
[1:23:09] Right amen then we move forward are you
[1:23:12] hearing what a prophet saying he's
[1:23:14] saying get your conscience in harmony
[1:23:16] with your subconscious and your
[1:23:18] subconscious in harmony with the word
[1:23:20] and get all three of them saying the
[1:23:22] same thing
[1:23:23] that God Is Right his word is right he
[1:23:25] said we got orders everything there's
[1:23:27] nothing in your way there's nothing to
[1:23:29] make it out it all the symtoms you could
[1:23:31] have you might go back to the hospital
[1:23:32] in the morning and they'd say well your
[1:23:34] arm is still stiff and the cancer is
[1:23:36] still there amen but that wouldn't phes
[1:23:38] you a bit amen see because if that this
[1:23:42] and this is agreed amen then Faith does
[1:23:44] anything let me say this harmony has a
[1:23:47] supernatural power amen if you can get
[1:23:50] the subconscious amen and the man
[1:23:52] upstairs amen the subconscious and the
[1:23:54] conscience all in agreement amen the
[1:23:56] ship is going to leave the harbor and if
[1:23:59] you can get a believer's conscience in
[1:24:01] agreement with the subconscious and get
[1:24:03] all those in agreement with the word
[1:24:05] amen then there will become a display of
[1:24:07] the supernatural power of almighty God
[1:24:10] and he will deliver you from the
[1:24:11] situation he will heal you from the
[1:24:13] sickness he will bring you out of the
[1:24:15] bondage of the enemy listen I believe
[1:24:17] Harmony has a supernatural power brother
[1:24:21] said now in you is God who have the Holy
[1:24:23] Ghost amen God is in you do you believe
[1:24:26] that amen Jesus said I give you power he
[1:24:28] said now let me show you amen the
[1:24:31] weakness of the church by God's grace I
[1:24:33] give you power over unclean
[1:24:36] spirits you'll cast them out not I will
[1:24:39] you will you'll cast in my name they
[1:24:41] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[1:24:44] with new tongues now do we believe
[1:24:47] that they shall take up serpents and
[1:24:50] they shall drink deadly things and it
[1:24:52] will not harm
[1:24:54] them now look in Acts 28 the pr God
[1:24:57] reads it about Paul said he was
[1:24:59] gathering a bundle of sticks and he laid
[1:25:01] them on the fire amen and there come up
[1:25:03] a viper out of the Heat and fastened on
[1:25:05] his hand now do you realize what happens
[1:25:07] here amen is God has promised Paul amen
[1:25:10] by a heavenly vision that Paul is going
[1:25:13] to a certain destination and the prophet
[1:25:15] of God said when he throwed some wood
[1:25:17] down amen a great deadly Beast a serpent
[1:25:20] amen bit him right to the hand he said
[1:25:22] now that Beast was so deadly till if it
[1:25:24] bit a person they usually Dro dead
[1:25:27] within a minute or two now the natives
[1:25:29] said look at this man the chains on him
[1:25:30] he's a prisoner he must be a murderer
[1:25:33] see he might escape the storm but he's
[1:25:35] just not going to escape this serpent
[1:25:37] he's going to die he said but now look a
[1:25:39] moment amen Paul looked and seen it now
[1:25:42] look Paul is gathering sticks amen and
[1:25:44] there's a serpent bites him on the hand
[1:25:46] amen and the serpent brother William has
[1:25:49] fastened his things Amen to the to the
[1:25:51] prophet's hand and the part of God said
[1:25:53] Paul looked and seen it amen but this
[1:25:56] this and that all agreed amen and there
[1:25:58] was not a speck of fear in other words
[1:26:01] Paul's conscience was in agreement with
[1:26:03] the subconscious and the subconscious
[1:26:05] and the conscience was in agreement with
[1:26:07] the heavenly vision that you will stand
[1:26:09] before king of grippa and nothing will
[1:26:11] defeat you Amen in standing before the
[1:26:14] Prophet come on church I believe that
[1:26:16] ought to be the same Harmony that ought
[1:26:18] to be in every believer here tonight
[1:26:20] that no matter what serpent bites me no
[1:26:22] matter what devil attacks me no matter
[1:26:24] what Spirit tries to stop me amen I have
[1:26:27] had a vision spoken over my life I'm
[1:26:30] going in the Rapture I'm going in the
[1:26:32] future home I'm going to take a body
[1:26:34] change I'm going to wear a crown I'm
[1:26:36] going to lay down my sword I'm going to
[1:26:38] lay down my shield now ien amen if you
[1:26:41] don't want me to preach quit pushing
[1:26:43] amen I tell you why that things don't
[1:26:44] move you no more is you gotten so
[1:26:46] theological amen that you can't receive
[1:26:48] Revelation and you become a cold formal
[1:26:51] theologian and the power of the Holy
[1:26:53] Ghost don't move you the anointing don't
[1:26:55] move you because you got everything
[1:26:56] figured out for your intellectual
[1:26:58] ability amen but I curse that devil in
[1:27:01] the name of Jesus Christ and I invite
[1:27:03] the spirit of Revelation to come back in
[1:27:06] the church until there's a liberty of
[1:27:08] anointing I don't care about your
[1:27:10] intellectualism I don't care about your
[1:27:12] message education I care about the power
[1:27:15] of the harmony of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:27:17] coming in the church in the fire and the
[1:27:20] Dynamics of the spirit of God
[1:27:23] I'd rather be S dumb I couldn't quote
[1:27:25] one scripture and read one good quote
[1:27:27] and have the harmony of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:30] amen burning in my
[1:27:34] body well I might as well preach I'm
[1:27:39] here and we got so theological we can't
[1:27:42] even enjoy the anointing no more that's
[1:27:44] so that's so educated and so
[1:27:46] intellectual amen we can't even enjoy a
[1:27:48] good old a good old Sunday night meeting
[1:27:50] I remember Sunday nights brother him I
[1:27:52] remember when he used to sing to the
[1:27:53] glory came down I remember when he used
[1:27:55] to preach till the fire fell I remember
[1:27:57] we used to shout and dance and enjoy the
[1:28:00] promises of God Amen I tell you what put
[1:28:02] that out is a bunch of cold formal ideas
[1:28:05] amen put the move of the Holy Ghost on
[1:28:07] the outside and said well we need
[1:28:08] teaching and we need some good sound
[1:28:10] saying teaching well let me say this
[1:28:12] William Brandon was the greatest teacher
[1:28:14] that ever stood on the face of the Earth
[1:28:15] and taught the scripture and there was
[1:28:17] still a fire of stimulation by
[1:28:20] Revelation that come into His me
[1:28:22] meetings and back the thing up and I
[1:28:24] pray to God we never get so educated
[1:28:26] that we can't let the stimulation of the
[1:28:28] revelation of the Holy Ghost come in the
[1:28:31] church and back up our young people's
[1:28:33] praise and back up our worship and back
[1:28:35] up our praise come on I think it's time
[1:28:37] to break out of the shackles and the
[1:28:39] chains of intellectualism and let the
[1:28:42] Holy Ghost back in the church what
[1:28:45] somebody prais him I said somebody
[1:28:47] praise him that's how we're going to run
[1:28:49] that devil out of here is we're going to
[1:28:51] praise and we're going to sing and we're
[1:28:53] going to shout and we're going to preach
[1:28:55] and we're going to enjoy the stimulation
[1:28:57] of the Revelation that'll deliver a man
[1:28:59] from things it'll save a
[1:29:02] home I hate that code formal
[1:29:05] intellectual level it comes in the house
[1:29:07] of God and tries to clamp down the
[1:29:09] atmosphere and clamp down the song
[1:29:11] service and clamp down y'all got the
[1:29:12] wrong guy to push against tonight and
[1:29:14] clamp down the anointing I think we
[1:29:16] ought to push back I think we ought to
[1:29:18] push back against that devil until we
[1:29:20] should get some Liberty in the church
[1:29:21] and can have church again whatever
[1:29:23] happened to just having Church whatever
[1:29:26] happened to just singing brother Merl if
[1:29:29] the Holy Ghost come in the building and
[1:29:30] he wanted to run he just ran if the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost come in the building and somebody
[1:29:34] wanted to shout they just shouted amen
[1:29:37] but some ey sickles gathered and tried
[1:29:38] to shut the fire down but I invite the
[1:29:41] pillar of fire to burn the icicles out
[1:29:44] and bring the anointing of the Holy
[1:29:46] Ghost in power and demonstration back
[1:29:49] into the church
[1:29:50] again
[1:29:53] well go ahead and praise God go ahead
[1:29:55] and praise him praise him for his word
[1:29:58] praise him for his Deliverance praise
[1:29:59] him for his anointing praise him for his
[1:30:01] victory that's it buddy amen amen you
[1:30:04] got a young man over there praising God
[1:30:06] Amen listen church I think it's time
[1:30:08] Amen to get in agreement with the word
[1:30:10] and get out of agreement with everything
[1:30:13] else come on get back in agreement with
[1:30:17] the Holy
[1:30:18] Ghost Paul wasn't scared he knew knew
[1:30:22] who he
[1:30:23] was Paul didn't stand there and quote a
[1:30:25] bunch of quotes he knew in his
[1:30:27] subconscious and his conscience and the
[1:30:30] vision that nothing was going to destroy
[1:30:32] him so you know what he done he just
[1:30:35] stood there for a minute and it just
[1:30:37] shook it
[1:30:38] off now come on Church there was some
[1:30:41] people standing there sister Angie they
[1:30:43] were waiting on Paul to die they were
[1:30:45] waiting on him to kill over y'all know
[1:30:47] what there's some people doing they're
[1:30:48] literally waiting on you to call to just
[1:30:50] kill over
[1:30:52] they want you to just fall over they
[1:30:54] want you to choke on your words and they
[1:30:56] don't want the anointing to break out in
[1:30:57] the meeting amen but let me say this if
[1:30:59] it couldn't defeat Paul it will not
[1:31:02] defeat this bride because what our
[1:31:04] Prophet preached is the same thing Paul
[1:31:06] preached if he walked in the word we're
[1:31:08] walking in the word and we refuse to be
[1:31:11] diluted down to some lukor Toral amen
[1:31:14] social gathering on a Sunday night this
[1:31:16] is the house of change this is the house
[1:31:19] of Liberty this is where the Holy Ghost
[1:31:21] comes and does things that men cannot do
[1:31:24] and fixes situations that we cannot
[1:31:26] counsel come on Church you want some
[1:31:28] counsel amen bring the counselor back in
[1:31:30] the building he's the Mighty God of
[1:31:32] Isaiah he's the Prince of Peace he's the
[1:31:34] Everlasting father if you'll turn him
[1:31:36] loose he'll fix all your
[1:31:41] situations well is it the truth or what
[1:31:44] I think it's time to get out of
[1:31:47] agreement with all the problems and get
[1:31:49] back in agreement with a word
[1:31:52] and let the harmony of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:55] come back in the church amen because
[1:31:57] what happens the part of God said
[1:31:58] miracles are done he said they were so
[1:32:01] perfectly in harmony with God that first
[1:32:03] church and Christian friend until we can
[1:32:05] get back to that amen denomination will
[1:32:07] not bring it amen but perfect love and
[1:32:10] confidence in God is what brings it so
[1:32:14] the conscience the subc conscience and
[1:32:16] it all comes in harmony with the
[1:32:19] word then our words or rather our orders
[1:32:23] are coming down from the word and we are
[1:32:25] agreeing with him and we're getting out
[1:32:28] of the harbor now I love what the
[1:32:29] protagon said he said now look brother
[1:32:31] the time has come y'all believe that yes
[1:32:34] sir we're in the last day we're in the
[1:32:37] atomic age the time has come they got a
[1:32:39] weapon they can shake the world from its
[1:32:41] orbit in five minutes time the sun can
[1:32:43] cause a total Annihilation and they
[1:32:46] couldn't have done that before but the
[1:32:47] time has come amen now right the time
[1:32:49] has come where there's a fallen away the
[1:32:51] Bible said except there cometh Fallen
[1:32:53] away the man sin will not be revealed he
[1:32:55] said the Pentecostal church is living in
[1:32:58] the final of all times the time has come
[1:33:00] the time has come for the signs to fall
[1:33:02] The Believers we're at the end time we
[1:33:04] are in the latter rain we're at the time
[1:33:07] when men will be heady highminded lovers
[1:33:09] of pleasure more than lovers of God they
[1:33:12] will be truth Breakers false accusers
[1:33:14] incontinent and despisers of those that
[1:33:17] are good hey High minded the time has
[1:33:20] come when they're teaching doctrines of
[1:33:22] devils amen perverting the Bible's
[1:33:24] teaching into theories and theologies
[1:33:27] amen to draw groups of people away after
[1:33:30] them the time has come that God will
[1:33:32] gather his church together under one
[1:33:34] great big banner of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:36] Christ and will pour out his powers
[1:33:39] among them at the same time brother the
[1:33:41] Merl that they're perverting the Bible
[1:33:43] they're teaching doctrines of devils is
[1:33:45] the same time that God is pouring out
[1:33:48] his spirit and brother Kobe he's
[1:33:50] Gathering his bride together together
[1:33:52] not under many banners but under one
[1:33:55] Banner now come on I might as well
[1:33:57] preach I'm here we used to be under one
[1:33:59] banner and it was simply the message of
[1:34:01] the
[1:34:04] hour now come on Church y'all remember
[1:34:08] amen you see a Believer out somewhere
[1:34:09] and you're just so happy to see a
[1:34:11] Believer you know why amen because you
[1:34:13] was under one Banner of the message amen
[1:34:15] but the devil come in and we got a twoo
[1:34:18] banner and a Thunders banner and a
[1:34:20] return Banner and a tape only banner and
[1:34:23] an intellectual banner and a deep
[1:34:24] teaching Banner well come on I'm
[1:34:27] preaching to you now we got all kinds of
[1:34:29] banners and now nobody know which one to
[1:34:31] stand under and a double-minded man is
[1:34:33] unstable in all his ways because one
[1:34:35] week he's under this banner and the next
[1:34:37] week he's under that Banner amen but why
[1:34:38] don't we tear down all them banners and
[1:34:41] lift up the banner of the message of the
[1:34:43] hour over the people and gather them
[1:34:46] under the spirit of God where the powers
[1:34:48] of God are being poured out and signs
[1:34:50] and wonders and things are taking place
[1:34:53] amen the time has come for the
[1:34:55] Pentecostal Church to make a stand the
[1:34:57] time has come to circumcise the church
[1:34:59] and to call out all this foolishness the
[1:35:01] time has come to go back to the old
[1:35:03] Landmark the time has come for the
[1:35:05] outpouring the time has come for the
[1:35:07] Gathering of the people are you ready
[1:35:10] for this the time has come for Jesus to
[1:35:14] come the time has come for Jesus to come
[1:35:18] can I say this he is not coming for
[1:35:21] dividing
[1:35:22] church he is not coming for a divided
[1:35:25] body he is coming for the unified body
[1:35:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ under the
[1:35:31] headship or the banner of the word of
[1:35:33] God now in 1964 brother man preaches a
[1:35:36] beautiful sermon you know what he calls
[1:35:38] it he calls it Shalom and he says now
[1:35:41] this word Shalom actually is a peace
[1:35:43] greeting and he said now what I'm doing
[1:35:45] here is saying Shalom to the
[1:35:48] church right gross darkness is on the
[1:35:50] people
[1:35:53] but Shalom to the bride now when brother
[1:35:56] B preaches shalom in 1964 he introduces
[1:35:59] to us the thought that God has a great
[1:36:04] Symphony now when you look at this word
[1:36:06] Symphony it is an elaborate musical
[1:36:08] composition it is for full Orchestra now
[1:36:11] I love this brother Kobe a symphony
[1:36:14] normally is in typically in four
[1:36:17] movements at least one of which is
[1:36:20] traditionally in the not a form now when
[1:36:22] I read that I'm the guy that says four
[1:36:24] movements okay now there were four death
[1:36:27] Messengers that eat the tree down but if
[1:36:30] this is moving in four if there were
[1:36:32] four death Messengers eat it down there
[1:36:34] will be four life Messengers that will
[1:36:37] restore it back he said now do you know
[1:36:39] what a symphony is I know you do it's
[1:36:41] music it's a drama and see they acted
[1:36:43] out amen now watch this if you have a
[1:36:46] symphony they're going to play music to
[1:36:48] act out the symphony in other words you
[1:36:51] got to have instruments Amen to act out
[1:36:53] the symphony he said like little Russian
[1:36:55] Symphony sometimes they act out on the
[1:36:56] drums you know about the little
[1:36:57] woodpecker you know got down the woods
[1:36:59] and they had the fluttering the beating
[1:37:01] on the drums and things you hear it all
[1:37:02] as you go to the symphony as they play
[1:37:04] it I forget the name of it oh yeah Peter
[1:37:05] and the Wolf that's right amen now watch
[1:37:07] see they don't have little figures
[1:37:10] flying around amen play it out but they
[1:37:12] play it on drums knock some wood
[1:37:15] together and then knocks on something
[1:37:16] else see and make the drums and the
[1:37:19] sounds and things it plays it out amen
[1:37:22] it acts it out now listen if you're
[1:37:24] going to have a symphony amen the
[1:37:26] musicians have got to find the right
[1:37:30] key if you're going to have a symphony
[1:37:33] you got to get the musicians in the
[1:37:35] right key and the part of God said there
[1:37:37] are people that like to play a piano or
[1:37:38] music they don't just know how to do it
[1:37:40] but they go there and the teacher might
[1:37:42] take a lesson after lesson and they
[1:37:43] would never learn it see they just
[1:37:45] cannot hold that key to the mystery of
[1:37:47] how the Rhythm and the sounds of the
[1:37:49] tuning and so forth rings out it takes
[1:37:52] the key so when somebody gets up to sing
[1:37:55] amen they say give me the key of A or
[1:37:57] give me the key of C or give me the key
[1:37:59] of G amen now listen if they're in the
[1:38:01] key of G and the piano players in the
[1:38:03] key ofc it's not going to have a
[1:38:05] pleasing effect but if you get the
[1:38:07] singer in the same key as the musician
[1:38:10] amen then there's going to come Harmony
[1:38:12] I'm preaching to you now do you realize
[1:38:15] if you're going to have Harmony you got
[1:38:16] to have more than a
[1:38:18] solo anybody can sing a solo but if
[1:38:21] you're going to have Harmony you got to
[1:38:23] have more than one part which means
[1:38:25] those multiple Parts have got to come
[1:38:27] into agreement to make a pleasing effect
[1:38:30] of sound on the people and the prod God
[1:38:33] turns and says the word of God is like a
[1:38:35] great Symphony he said if you don't
[1:38:37] understand the symphony it's a big bunch
[1:38:38] of Racket to you if you don't understand
[1:38:41] it if you don't understand the symphony
[1:38:44] it's a big bunch of Racket to you it's
[1:38:46] all done by signs and motions but it
[1:38:48] acts out a drama in this Symphony he so
[1:38:51] now we noce the only one that
[1:38:52] understands the symphony is the composer
[1:38:55] so the first person that understands the
[1:38:57] symphony is the composer who wrote it he
[1:39:01] said and those who are interested in
[1:39:03] knowing about it amen to know it changes
[1:39:06] Amen to know what takes place he said
[1:39:08] the composer the composer he knows every
[1:39:11] move from the end to the beginning did
[1:39:13] you know that the one who wrote it up he
[1:39:15] composes this he knows every little
[1:39:17] Junction he knows every Junction so does
[1:39:20] the director have to do ired now watch
[1:39:22] now watch him he's bringing the spirit
[1:39:24] of Unity on down so the the composer
[1:39:26] knows it but now the composure is moving
[1:39:29] into the director he said now how you
[1:39:31] going to twist the Creed in that one
[1:39:33] little miscue of that stick that sign
[1:39:35] one little Miss sign that djunction with
[1:39:37] throw the whole Orchestra off would
[1:39:38] throw the whole Symphony out now you
[1:39:40] know that's true the composer and the
[1:39:43] director has to be in the same Spirit he
[1:39:46] said that's why I'm ministering the word
[1:39:47] of God God's Great Symphony he's been
[1:39:50] playing since the B of time the minister
[1:39:52] at the word has to not look over here
[1:39:54] and say I believe this ought to be you
[1:39:56] ought to make it this way he's got to go
[1:39:58] the way the Sheep music says take
[1:40:01] it that's the way the gospel has got to
[1:40:04] be preached the way the word says take
[1:40:06] it you know if you throw a Creed in
[1:40:08] there you got the whole thing messed up
[1:40:10] it's got to go make the drama just
[1:40:12] exactly right now watch what Paul said
[1:40:15] if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[1:40:18] then who shall prepare himself for the
[1:40:20] battle brother said there's many things
[1:40:21] that give sounds and there's many
[1:40:23] uncertain sounds today there is
[1:40:25] uncertainty on every hand it's
[1:40:26] uncertainty in everything that you look
[1:40:28] at amen but there's one thing that's
[1:40:30] certain and that is in Christ The Gospel
[1:40:34] has no uncertain
[1:40:37] sound now the PRT of God Revelation 10:7
[1:40:40] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:40:42] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:40:45] mystery of God should be
[1:40:48] finished as he has declared
[1:40:51] to his servants the prophets said there
[1:40:53] Seven Seals on the book the book will
[1:40:55] not the seals will not be released to
[1:40:56] the message of the seventh angel so we
[1:40:58] are
[1:41:00] presuming but the genuine revelation of
[1:41:03] God will be made perfect in that
[1:41:07] sounding Vindicated
[1:41:10] truth now that's exactly what the word
[1:41:13] says the mystery should be finished at
[1:41:15] that time so in other words the spirit
[1:41:18] is coming in the church and is tuning
[1:41:20] Our Hearts to God so what does the
[1:41:22] message of the hour do the message of
[1:41:24] the hour puts us back in Rhythm and in
[1:41:27] tune with the Sheep music he said when
[1:41:29] it gets in the right swing of it the
[1:41:30] right Spirit of it how you going to do
[1:41:32] the spirit comes down the composure now
[1:41:33] watch when you say the days of Miracles
[1:41:36] never passed the symphony Cries Out amen
[1:41:39] when he hit Jesus Christ the same
[1:41:41] yesterday today and forever the symphony
[1:41:43] cries out you shall receive power after
[1:41:46] the Holy Ghost has come upon you the
[1:41:48] symphony cries I got it amen he says
[1:41:51] amen I got it now listen there's no more
[1:41:54] guess work about it then the whole
[1:41:56] symphony is right in harmony with the
[1:41:59] word brother R claps his hand together
[1:42:01] three times he says now watch the
[1:42:03] director the composer must be in the
[1:42:06] same spirit and so must the musicians be
[1:42:09] in the same Spirit to act it out he said
[1:42:12] so in the end time God's Bible and the
[1:42:14] believer will all come together now can
[1:42:16] I say this to you in closing amen listen
[1:42:19] he says to the authentic authenticated
[1:42:21] prophet of God who appears in this last
[1:42:24] age what he says from God Amen the bride
[1:42:27] might
[1:42:28] say what he says from God the bride will
[1:42:31] think about saying no that's not what
[1:42:33] the message says what he says from God
[1:42:36] the bride will say now watch this amen
[1:42:40] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:42:42] will be saying the same thing amen I
[1:42:45] don't know if you can give it to me or
[1:42:46] not but the picture there of the pillar
[1:42:47] of fire over the prophet's head amen the
[1:42:50] spirit and and the prophet and the bride
[1:42:52] will be saying the same thing now watch
[1:42:55] this and what they say will have already
[1:42:58] been said in the word now do you
[1:42:59] remember the prophet God said amen that
[1:43:02] the composer the M the director and the
[1:43:05] musician must come in the same spirit
[1:43:07] amen here he's saying the spirit amen
[1:43:10] the prophet and the bride will all be
[1:43:12] saying the same thing now a lot of
[1:43:14] people don't like this picture amen but
[1:43:16] I tell you why they don't like it it's
[1:43:17] CU they have not received the mind of
[1:43:19] Christ to Elevate their thinking above
[1:43:22] the fact that there's a man's picture in
[1:43:24] the picture but if you'll receive the
[1:43:26] mind of Christ he will raise your
[1:43:28] thinking amen above the picture of
[1:43:30] brother brandom up to the pillar of fire
[1:43:32] above his head and you will see that
[1:43:34] that is the composure of the word of God
[1:43:37] listen friends that is the composer of
[1:43:40] the Sheep music amen that's not a
[1:43:42] guesser that's not a hoper amen that is
[1:43:45] the direct composer of the Sheep music
[1:43:48] The Man underneath the composer is the
[1:43:50] the director of the symphony in the last
[1:43:52] day and he stood up and we are the
[1:43:55] musicians underneath the composure and
[1:43:58] the director and we're all in the same
[1:44:01] spirit and we're all saying the same
[1:44:03] thing the composer and the director and
[1:44:06] the musicians will be in the same
[1:44:09] spirits and the spirit and the prophet
[1:44:11] and the bride will all be
[1:44:13] saying the same thing now What's
[1:44:16] Happening Here is the purpose of
[1:44:18] symphony is to bring these three parts
[1:44:21] into harmony oh God to transform the
[1:44:24] Sheep music into
[1:44:28] reality now can you give me Isaiah 12:1
[1:44:31] the Bible says in that day Thou shalt
[1:44:33] say oh Lord I will praise thee though
[1:44:36] thou was anger with me thine anger is
[1:44:38] turned away and now Comfort us me behold
[1:44:42] God is my salvation I will trust and not
[1:44:46] be afraid are y'all ready for this for
[1:44:49] the Lord Jehovah is my
[1:44:53] strength and what
[1:44:55] else the Lord Jehovah is my strength and
[1:45:00] my song he has also become my salvation
[1:45:04] therefore with joy shall ye draw water
[1:45:07] out of the wells of Salvation And in
[1:45:09] that day shall you say praise the Lord
[1:45:13] not nod not look around in that day you
[1:45:16] shall say praise the Lord call upon his
[1:45:19] name declare his doings among the people
[1:45:23] make mention that his name is exalted
[1:45:25] look at the next verse amen sing unto
[1:45:28] the Lord now come on church sing unto
[1:45:31] the Lord for he hath done excellent
[1:45:34] things that it shall be known in all the
[1:45:35] Earth cry out and

[1:45:44] shouting cuz I'm too old no the truth is

[1:45:54] under the anointing and Shop their shoe
[1:45:55] heels off you know why cuz they weren't
[1:45:57] freezing with theology they were burning
[1:46:00] with Revelation they had a fire sh up in
[1:46:02] their bones listen quit letting the
[1:46:04] devil give you every excuse on why you
[1:46:06] don't entertain the presence of God just
[1:46:09] admit it you don't want to but quit
[1:46:11] getting on the people that
[1:46:13] do well I feel I taken my Liberty and
[1:46:16] preaching for a second amen don't get
[1:46:18] mad cuz we got fire don't get mad listen

[1:46:23] that song you don't know like I know
[1:46:25] what he done for me everybody jumps up
[1:46:27] and shouts well maybe you don't have
[1:46:29] nothing to shout about but if you was as
[1:46:31] lost as I was lost if you was as bound
[1:46:34] as I was bound if you was as broke as I
[1:46:37] was broken and the Lord Jehovah come
[1:46:40] into your midst as the god of the
[1:46:42] Salvation of the soul and you begin to
[1:46:44] feel his presence come in the building
[1:46:46] it'll put a shout in your feet it'll put
[1:46:48] a clap in your hand it'll put a dance in
[1:46:51] your step it will put an amen on your
[1:46:53] lips because Jehovah has come among his
[1:46:56] church and he said cry out son and Shout
[1:46:59] aloud amen listen for great is the Holy
[1:47:02] One of Israel in the midst of
[1:47:06] thee now that word sing means to sing
[1:47:13] praise are you'all ready for the rest of
[1:47:15] the
[1:47:16] definition to make
[1:47:19] music to play a musical instrument can I
[1:47:23] say this musical instruments must be in
[1:47:29] tune
[1:47:31] now brother wend speaking from
[1:47:34] experience musical instruments must be
[1:47:36] in tun so if you're going to have a
[1:47:38] concert or some if you're goingon to
[1:47:39] have a group of singers come in brother
[1:47:41] Kobe they're not going to pull up if the
[1:47:43] concert starts at 7 they're not going to
[1:47:45] pull up at 6:30 unload all the music and
[1:47:48] just get up and start singing
[1:47:51] they're going to get their hours ahead
[1:47:52] of time and they're going to tune their
[1:47:54] instruments they're going to check their
[1:47:56] soundtracks they're going to have what
[1:47:58] they call a soundcheck I think we need
[1:48:00] to start having those in the message
[1:48:01] again we used to check everything by the
[1:48:06] word come on Church remember we used to
[1:48:09] give things the word test amen we didn't
[1:48:11] give it the personality test brother
[1:48:13] Mike we gave it the word test but now we
[1:48:15] give it the personality test but I think
[1:48:17] we ought to give back together it the
[1:48:18] word test and if it came pass the word
[1:48:21] test it shouldn't be on the
[1:48:24] platform if it can't pass the word test
[1:48:27] it shouldn't be in our homes it
[1:48:28] shouldn't be in our lives listen get
[1:48:30] away from the uncertain sound and get
[1:48:32] back to a certain sound which is the
[1:48:35] sound of the revelation of the word of
[1:48:38] God now they don't get off the bus and
[1:48:41] just walk in and get up and start
[1:48:42] strumming instruments and singing songs
[1:48:43] All Out Of Tune but they get in here and
[1:48:46] they get all the instruments in tune and
[1:48:49] they get all their voice voice just
[1:48:50] blending together and then 7:00 they
[1:48:52] step up and they begin to sing and you
[1:48:55] know what happens you begin to enjoy the
[1:48:57] song that they sing because somebody is
[1:48:59] in
[1:49:00] tune can I say this Jehovah has come in
[1:49:04] this building
[1:49:07] tonight Jehovah is in this building
[1:49:09] tonight and brother he wants to sing a
[1:49:14] song is that okay brother John Jehovah
[1:49:17] wants to sing a song but guess what
[1:49:20] he's not wanting to play the song on the
[1:49:23] piano he's not wanting to play it on the
[1:49:25] drums he's not wanting to play it on the
[1:49:27] guitar he's wanting to sing a song but
[1:49:30] he's wanting to use you as his
[1:49:33] instruments are you hearing me Jehovah
[1:49:36] wants to sing a song but he wants to use
[1:49:38] you as his instruments listen amen if
[1:49:41] somebody going to sing a song they're
[1:49:42] going to use the instruments to make the
[1:49:44] music and if Jehovah wants to sing a
[1:49:46] song He's going to use you as the
[1:49:49] instrument listen he wants to sing the
[1:49:51] song of healing so he's going to use
[1:49:52] your body to sing it out of he wants to
[1:49:55] sing the song of Deliverance but he's
[1:49:57] going to use your body to play the song
[1:49:59] listen I pray to God we never get so
[1:50:01] starchy and so cold that Jehovah comes
[1:50:04] in the church and wants to sing a song
[1:50:06] and all this must Out Of Tune and
[1:50:08] they're all warped and bent and one
[1:50:09] won't speak to the other and one don't
[1:50:11] like this just let all that go and let
[1:50:14] our instruments get back in tune so
[1:50:16] Jehovah can come back in the church and
[1:50:19] sing his s song he wants to sing I'm a
[1:50:21] savior he wants to sing I'm a Healer he
[1:50:24] wants to sing I'm a miracle worker he
[1:50:26] wants to sing I'm a redeemer but
[1:50:28] somebody has got to lend their body to
[1:50:30] God as an instrument in tune to play the
[1:50:35] song that he wants to
[1:50:42] sing Listen somebody can sing but if the
[1:50:47] music doesn't have the tune it's Out Of
[1:50:53] Tune it's not going to have a pleasing
[1:50:57] effect now let me close by saying this
[1:51:00] to you brother tells us a story about an
[1:51:02] oxin one
[1:51:03] time he said they were oying off of
[1:51:06] violin he said the auctioneer stood up
[1:51:08] there and he held it up and he said what
[1:51:10] am I offered for this well brother they
[1:51:13] looked at that violin brother Levi they
[1:51:16] looked at it and they said you know it's
[1:51:17] old and crummy and don't look like much
[1:51:20] couldn't even get a bed on it finally
[1:51:21] somebody said I'll give you a dollar now
[1:51:24] watch this the violin Was Out Of
[1:51:27] Tune the violin was out of Harmony it
[1:51:30] was at the auction I'm preaching to you
[1:51:32] now it was at the auction because
[1:51:35] someone thought this it's finished and
[1:51:38] we can't get no more music out of
[1:51:46] it it's
[1:51:48] finished it's served its purpose it's
[1:51:51] old it's crummy it's Out Of Tune it's
[1:51:55] got cobwebs brother said it had scars on
[1:51:57] it now listen y'all don't y'all don't go
[1:52:00] buy a brand new Martin guitar amen and
[1:52:02] two days later send us the
[1:52:04] auction do you no because it's got value
[1:52:08] to you but when it looks like it has no
[1:52:10] more value you get rid of it so somebody
[1:52:13] thought this violin was finished brother
[1:52:16] Miguel there could be no more music come
[1:52:18] out of it but watch a problem
[1:52:20] but there was one standing there that
[1:52:22] didn't think it ought to sell for that
[1:52:24] so he went over and picked it up and he
[1:52:26] struck in his hand and he picked up the
[1:52:28] bow and rosing it and he played a tune
[1:52:31] and when he did everyone started crying
[1:52:33] and the auctioneer said what am I
[1:52:34] offered and somebody said 2,000 somebody
[1:52:37] else said 5,000 somebody else said
[1:52:39] 10,000 said see what was it the Master's
[1:52:43] Hand revealed what was veiled in the old
[1:52:48] instrument it was finished it was done
[1:52:51] brother Robert amen but God who is rich
[1:52:53] in Mercy said it shouldn't sell for
[1:52:56] that come on church and the prod of God
[1:52:59] said this he said this book is ragged
[1:53:02] it's been laughed at been made fun of
[1:53:04] it's at the domination auction today the
[1:53:05] roal Council of churches he said but
[1:53:07] remember remember there is something in
[1:53:10] the old book that promised there would
[1:53:12] be a predestinated hand ordained hand
[1:53:15] come one day that would pick it up and
[1:53:17] make the word of this book through a pre
[1:53:20] destinated heart to the task it's made
[1:53:22] for reveal the promises that's in it it
[1:53:25] might look like an old bunch of Holy
[1:53:26] Rollers or something other but it just
[1:53:28] takes the Master's Hand the word on it
[1:53:31] to reveal the word are you ready for
[1:53:33] that and it becomes more than a Holy
[1:53:35] Roller well glory to God when the master
[1:53:39] gets a hold of it it becomes more than a
[1:53:41] Holy Roller it becomes that to every one
[1:53:44] of us hasn't it friends it's not a bunch
[1:53:46] of fanaticism are you ready for this it
[1:53:49] depends
[1:53:50] on Whose hand the bow is
[1:53:53] in now I'm breaking it down to you

[1:53:58] he said the violin was on The Oxen block
[1:54:00] he said but now watch amen a violin must
[1:54:03] have a bow oh God a violin must have a
[1:54:06] bow you can have the violin but if you

[2:10:59] sitting there and he said I looked at
[2:11:01] her and I said where should I start in

[2:11:07] said a beautiful girl like you start
[2:11:08] with you he said what's a girl like you
[2:11:11] doing in here and she began to tell her
[2:11:13] tell him her whole life
[2:11:15] story and he said now Sister we've
[2:11:18] prayed and he said you just keep turning
[2:11:19] a leave he said but you're just turning
[2:11:22] a page I said it's not right yet so I
[2:11:25] said let's pray some
