[26:45] to to make it out here today. And so we
[26:48] say God bless you and uh we we want to
[26:53] uh just say a special thanks to to uh
[26:57] brother Merl, brother Michael, brother
[27:00] um uh Nathaniel,
[27:03] brother Devin, brother Daniel
[27:06] uh for for their hard work so that we
[27:09] could come out here and um
[27:15] and so I I was uh I I was trying to
[27:19] hurry and get out the door to come out
[27:21] and do the the the sidewalks and brother
[27:23] and and I come out, brother Merl's
[27:25] outside there and and he was he was
[27:28] getting all the snow off my truck and
[27:30] and uh uh took care of our sidewalk and
[27:33] and all of that. I tell you, I
[27:35] appreciate that. God bless you, brother
[27:37] Merl. And um
[27:40] I uh so you know and so I said well we
[27:44] you know you think we need to do the
[27:47] snow you know and he says it's already
[27:48] taken care of over there on the
[27:50] sidewalk. So uh that was just wonderful.
[27:53] So we we appreciate that and um just
[27:57] were I I love snow. Amen. Uh you know I
[28:01] I'm not I'm not a guy that's uh I don't
[28:03] like the ice but you know we haven't had
[28:05] snow like this in a long time. And so,
[28:09] uh, so we we're I know you kids love
[28:11] that snow. Amen. But, uh, everybody but
[28:15] Noah. Noah don't like snow for some
[28:17] reason.
[28:20] No, he likes the snow, too. So, we u uh
[28:24] we have a few that's that's that's
[28:26] joining us online here this morning. So,
[28:28] we say God bless everyone on the
[28:30] internet.
[28:32] And um
[28:36] it looks like we were the only the the
[28:39] only ones having church here in town.
[28:40] All church roll. Everyone was all
[28:43] dismissed. So uh it it was nicer this
[28:47] morning. If if you have your Bibles,
[28:48] let's look here at Isaiah 52.
[28:52] And um we're going to start at the sixth
[28:54] verse.
[28:58] And so, um,
[29:01] we we just want to, um,
[29:05] minister, I figure since it was a snowy
[29:08] day, we would just, um,
[29:12] um, Amen. We'll just name our our title,
[29:15] White Snow.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Man, so, how do you kids like that?
[29:21] Amen. White like snow.
[29:25] And so um let's let's look here at
[29:28] Isaiah 52 and6.
[29:32] It says, "Therefore my people shall know
[29:35] my name.
[29:37] Therefore they shall know in that day
[29:40] that I am he that does speak.
[29:44] Behold, it is I."
[29:47] Now there's he's there's going to be a
[29:50] messenger, the messenger of messengers.
[29:53] And last week we talked about how Jesus
[29:56] was greater than angels. He was greater
[30:00] than than any supernatural thing. He was
[30:03] great even greater than the prophets.
[30:06] Jesus was the greater. And so he's
[30:09] saying in that day they shall know that
[30:12] I speak. Now then in the seventh verse
[30:15] he'll talk about the other messengers.
[30:18] Uh, how beautiful upon the mountain are
[30:21] the feet of him that bringeth good
[30:24] tidings, that publisheth peace, and
[30:26] brings good tidings of good, that
[30:29] publisheth salvation, that saith unto
[30:32] Zion, thy God reigns. So, this is still
[30:36] the voice of the one speaking. But the
[30:39] apostle Paul says that there would also
[30:41] be um the five-fold ministry that would
[30:45] bring this great news. And then the
[30:48] eighth verse, thy watchmen shall lift up
[30:51] thy voice up the voice with the voice
[30:55] together shall they sing. For they shall
[30:58] see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring
[31:02] again Zion. Break forth into joy. Sing
[31:06] together, ye waste places of Jerusalem,
[31:10] for the Lord has comforted his people.
[31:13] He has redeemed Jerusalem. Can I hear an
[31:17] amen?
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[31:21] we want to thank you today for your
[31:23] grace and for your mercies. Lord, we
[31:27] have been enjoying the snow and we thank
[31:29] you for keeping us all safe. Lord, thank
[31:32] you for protecting our homes and and
[31:35] Lord, just we we want to say thank you,
[31:38] Father. And Lord, as we come here today
[31:41] to worship, I ask, Lord, that your Holy
[31:45] Spirit would be among us in a in a real
[31:48] special way. Lord, we we ask that you
[31:52] would be with those who could not make
[31:54] it. All of our elders, Lord, who who are
[31:57] faithful to come, but Lord, they've
[31:59] stayed home and in the warmth and and we
[32:02] just ask, Lord, that you would be with
[32:05] them and ask Lord that they would the
[32:08] presence of God would be with them.
[32:11] Lord, we ask that you would help us this
[32:13] morning. We love you and we thank you
[32:15] for all things that you have given us in
[32:18] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can
[32:21] the church say amen?
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[32:26] seated.
[32:28] We um
[32:30] so we are thankful for this messenger.
[32:35] This messenger that came and amen Jesus
[32:40] Christ. You know, I I I I've thought of
[32:43] a faithful messenger. And as we think
[32:45] about um white as snow, I think you you
[32:49] know where we're going. I've got that
[32:51] where the scripture says your your sins
[32:54] will be white as snow. And and the the
[32:58] thing is we had to have a messenger from
[33:01] heaven. Amen. And this messenger was
[33:04] we've had a lot of messengers over the
[33:06] past. lots of angels like that that have
[33:09] that have visited prophets do that that
[33:11] have been um a very faithful messengers.
[33:16] Amen. And but but we needed a messenger
[33:20] that would that would be more than an
[33:24] angel. It would be more. And when Jesus
[33:27] came, he was a faithful messenger of
[33:32] eternal life. He was different because
[33:35] again, Amen. Uh he was he was God and he
[33:40] was human. So it wasn't just a shiny
[33:43] angel. It wasn't it wasn't Amen. But
[33:46] Jesus came, lived among us, dwelt among
[33:50] us. And I and I thought, Amen. Um I I I
[33:54] thought of a faithful servant, a
[33:56] faithful
[33:58] messenger.
[33:59] uh uh the the the Bible would actually
[34:02] refer to a faithful messenger as uh as
[34:06] snow in the harvest. There there in in
[34:08] Proverbs 29 and 13, it says, "As the
[34:12] cold of snow in the time of harvest, so
[34:16] is a faithful messenger to them that
[34:20] send him, for he refresheth the soul of
[34:24] his masters."
[34:26] I I've thought about the the the beauty
[34:28] of snow and and um I'm sure all of you
[34:32] kids were out playing in the snow and
[34:34] and God wanted to bring a few things
[34:36] with snow in it. And I I I thought, you
[34:40] know, sort of departing from what I was
[34:43] originally going to minister on, but
[34:45] snow represents purity,
[34:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Snow represents righteousness. It is
[34:52] refreshing and cool. Amen. and and and
[34:56] snow. Snow just makes everything
[34:58] beautiful. Makes the trees beautiful.
[35:01] All of those old dead trees and maybe
[35:04] you live in an ugly house on the outside
[35:06] and it it it just all of a sudden
[35:07] becomes pretty. Amen. When you when
[35:10] you've got the snow and and so, amen, a
[35:14] messenger to God is is refreshing as and
[35:17] that's the reason he had put it here as
[35:19] as the cold of snow in the time of the
[35:22] harvest. Amen. maybe uh uh don't don't
[35:26] really uh uh you know maybe the the the
[35:30] the moisture coming down and and and
[35:33] bringing in and refreshing the soul of
[35:36] of of his master and and um I I've
[35:39] thought about the messengers that God
[35:41] has sent over o over the the the Bible
[35:46] times. They were not just to cheer you.
[35:49] Amen. We needed more than just being
[35:52] cheered. We needed more than just being
[35:55] a um having a a a good speech or a a
[36:00] motivational talk.
[36:03] We as as as humans needed something
[36:07] greater. Jesus talked about, Amen. He
[36:10] gave a parable and how that Amen. the
[36:13] king would send messengers and and and
[36:17] and which were types of prophets and
[36:20] they would kill the messengers and the
[36:22] king was so so wanted to get the message
[36:27] to the people and make sure. So he sent
[36:30] messenger after messenger and they
[36:32] killed them. And then the Bible says
[36:35] that the king sent his very own son with
[36:38] the wi-i with with with the document and
[36:42] and said now now this must get to the
[36:46] people and and the Bible says that and
[36:49] Jesus said that they killed the
[36:52] messenger killed this his his the king's
[36:55] own son killed the very prince of life
[36:58] and and so amen of course we we
[37:01] understand that in God's providence. God
[37:05] knew that that was going to happen. And
[37:08] and and and so here the great king, the
[37:12] eternal God who had no body,
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. would send uh uh these prophets
[37:20] because they were humans and they would
[37:22] kill the prophets. Did y'all know that?
[37:24] Did you kids know that most of the
[37:26] prophets were killed? They were
[37:28] persecuted.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Sure. by the by the ones that that God
[37:32] would send them to. He would send them
[37:34] to the people and and and and tell them.
[37:36] It wasn't it wasn't a feel-good message.
[37:40] It wasn't a a a feel-good, but it was
[37:42] usually one saying, "Hey, Amen. You need
[37:45] to you you're in sin and and you've got
[37:48] these these things that you need to
[37:51] clarify in your Amen. You need to make
[37:54] your soul righteous before God. And and
[37:57] and and so but they would kill him.
[38:00] Amen. And and uh UH SO SO I YOU KNOW AS
[38:04] WE AS WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT this
[38:06] messenger here this morning. Amen. That
[38:09] when Jesus came it was sort of a trick.
[38:13] The devil were trying the devil was
[38:14] trying to kill the voice. But within
[38:19] this body was the code of life. And when
[38:24] they when they killed Jesus and THE
[38:27] BLOOD WAS COMING DOWN, THAT WAS NOT just
[38:30] human blood. It was God's blood in the
[38:34] body of Jesus. AND WHEN THE BLOOD CELL
[38:38] WAS BROKEN,
[38:40] eternal life was spilt or not spilt,
[38:44] brother brother Ken uh he corrected me
[38:46] on that one time and that is true. It's
[38:48] not spilt. Jesus gave his blood. AND SO
[38:52] THE BLOOD THAT WAS that that was coming
[38:56] down would be the very blood that would
[39:00] save you and me.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; And and and it was IT WAS GOING TO be so
[39:07] pure. THIS BLOOD WAS SO RIGHTEOUS. IT
[39:10] WAS SO PURE. AMEN. THE PURITY OF OF
[39:15] GOD'S DNA was in this blood.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No sin. NOW IN YOUR blood
[39:22] you we all come from our mom our daddy's
[39:24] blood cell right all of you kids come
[39:27] from from from a blood cell of your
[39:29] daddy and so you have got and and you
[39:32] have got a lot of mixed traits from your
[39:34] mama from your daddy you you they all
[39:37] come together that's all runs in your
[39:39] blood did you know as boys and girls
[39:42] that you guys can take they can do a
[39:45] test on you and and and can tell you
[39:48] whether or not you're going to have
[39:50] diabetes in the future, whether or not
[39:53] you you you there's there's there's a
[39:55] possibility of cancer. There's there's a
[39:58] lot of that that they can look through
[40:01] your your your blood cell. Praise the
[40:04] name of the Lord. BUT WHEN GOD CAME, GOD
[40:07] SENT THIS MESSENGER. And this messenger
[40:11] that came, God put the pure blood cell
[40:15] in this body. They had been killing
[40:18] every other messenger. They had been
[40:20] killing them. And he knew they were
[40:22] going to kill THIS ONE. BUT WHEN THIS
[40:24] ONE WAS KILLED, it was not going to be
[40:27] normal human blood, but it was going to
[40:29] be the very blood of God.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; And that BLOOD THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT
[40:36] BLOOD CELL THAT WAS open would give
[40:40] eternal life to you and to me. Do you
[40:43] realize tonight that you are saved or
[40:46] this morning that you are saved by the
[40:48] blood of God?
[40:49] &gt;&gt; So we don't need motivational speeches.
[40:52] We were in the prison house of sin and
[40:55] and we had the task masters of defeat.
[40:59] Amen. Task masters of devils of lying,
[41:02] devils of stealing, devils of cheating,
[41:06] rebellious devils. these these devils,
[41:09] amen, were taking advantage of us and
[41:12] and we did not need a a denominational
[41:16] uh messenger to to MOTIVATE SOMETHING in
[41:21] us and tell us how good we are and we
[41:23] when we get to heaven, we you know,
[41:26] everything's going to be good. But God
[41:28] wanted to do something for us right now.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Now those
[41:37] messengers would be as snow to God. It
[41:41] would be refreshing to God. Amen. Do do
[41:45] you realize how how important this is?
[41:48] Because now now first of all I think we
[41:50] need to the the scripture that you you
[41:53] kids have probably learned in Sunday
[41:54] school uh uh there in Romans 3 and10. As
[41:58] it is written there is none righteous,
[42:02] no not one. There is none that
[42:06] understands. There is none that seeks
[42:10] after God. And the 12th verse there uh
[42:13] they are all gone astray. They are uh
[42:16] together become unprofitable. There is
[42:19] none that doeth good. KNOW NOT ONE. SO
[42:23] THIS MESSENGERS I I I even say the
[42:26] five-fold ministry today that is
[42:28] declaring the message as brother John
[42:30] did the other night as as you hear.
[42:33] Amen. Uh I mean it is such a wonderful
[42:35] masterpiece but and and and you hear
[42:38] ministers minister. Brother Kobe,
[42:40] brother Michael, uh uh brother Josh, the
[42:43] different ones that minister, they they
[42:46] are THEY ARE LIKE REFRESH. THEY ARE TO
[42:48] BE LIKE REFRESHMENT to our hearts. When
[42:52] when we come to church and sometimes
[42:54] we're weary, we're tired. We're Amen.
[42:57] But God sends these messengers to to let
[43:00] us know how how wonderful it is. But it
[43:04] would not be anything if God did not
[43:08] shed his blood to give us his
[43:11] righteousness.
[43:13] Amen. H how would you like to stand it
[43:16] before God on that day? How would you
[43:18] like to stand before God on that day and
[43:21] and God saying, "Amen. uh uh that there
[43:25] is none righteous, know not one. H how
[43:28] would you like to stand there and say
[43:30] you're not righteous? You can't do good.
[43:34] But you see, Amen. This messenger Jesus
[43:37] Christ, Amen. He come, he come bearing
[43:41] the very blood of God. There in Isaiah
[43:45] 1:18, God is saying, "Come now and let
[43:48] us reason together, saith the Lord.
[43:52] Though your sins be as scarlet, nasty,
[43:56] and bad, and ugly, yet they shall be
[44:02] white as snow.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Though your sins ARE DARK AND UGLY.
[44:10] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. And y'all remember the
[44:13] time that I done the little illustration
[44:14] where we had the the little scummy pond
[44:17] over here and then and then the the the
[44:20] the fountain of life and all of the scum
[44:23] that was in it. That's what we were. And
[44:26] yet God says, "God sends a messenger.
[44:29] Come, let us reason together.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; LET'S LET'S LET'S SIT DOWN AND TALK."
[44:35] THERE'S SOMETHING about God. He's got to
[44:38] get the news to his people. Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "THOUGH YOUR SINS ARE LIKE
[44:44] that mucky," Amen. nasty stuff that I
[44:47] brought, they shall be white as snow
[44:52] again. What does God What is God
[44:54] wanting? God is wanting to share his
[44:58] righteousness with us.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise the Lord. that
[45:03] they're in in Psalms 51 and6. Behold,
[45:06] thou desires truth in the inward parts,
[45:10] and in the hidden part, thou shalt make
[45:13] me to know wisdom. Now, now this is
[45:17] incredible because lots of religion just
[45:20] wants to make you look good.
[45:22] So, anybody that comes into the church,
[45:25] man, some people, they won't even allow
[45:27] them to come in, ladies, to come in uh
[45:29] wearing pants. They they they won't let
[45:32] them come in uh if they they won't even
[45:34] let them get baptized, if they if they
[45:36] don't have everything all taken care of.
[45:39] And and Amen. But yet GOD'S DESIRE IS is
[45:44] saying, LISTEN, I WANT IT to be the
[45:48] insight. I want I'm reasoning with you.
[45:51] I And that's why the preacher comes
[45:53] service after service. Listen, you're in
[45:56] YOUR SIN. YOU'VE GOT TO COME TO ME.
[46:01] SURRENDER TO ME. I will bring you
[46:06] eternal life. You must follow me.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; But he he doesn't want it necessarily on
[46:13] the outside first. He wants it on the
[46:16] inside.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HE WANTS YOU TO LOVE
[46:20] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[46:22] He wants every one of you children to
[46:24] love righteousness. So what that means
[46:26] is, Amen. There's no one sneaking around
[46:29] the the back of the building. Amen.
[46:31] Trying to light up a used cigarette and
[46:33] see what it tastes like or or or or
[46:35] sneaking around and getting a piece of
[46:37] candy off the off the uh uh you know AT
[46:41] THE STORE. GOD GOD IS THAT THAT ACT IS
[46:44] WRONG. SMOKING IS WRONG. WEARING PANTS
[46:48] IS DEFINITELY wrong according to
[46:49] scripture. Amen. Doing these things are
[46:52] definitely WRONG. BUT GOD WANTS it on
[46:56] the inside of us.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Now, NOW HE WAS SAYING HERE, he says,
[47:03] "NOW, AMEN. THOU DESIRE TRUTH ON the
[47:07] inside
[47:09] and then the hidden part that no one
[47:11] knows about." He wants truth. Amen. What
[47:15] would truth? Truth is is being what you
[47:19] are. Amen. what you are right sitting
[47:23] here this morning being the same person
[47:25] when you're by yourself. Amen. When
[47:28] you're when it's just two of you
[47:30] teenagers together. When it's just two
[47:32] of you little children together. HE HE
[47:35] WANTS HE WANTS IT TO BE AMEN. the the
[47:39] the hidden part to be just as pure as
[47:44] the as as as as what you all look here
[47:47] at church here this morning. Yes.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; And when God begins to do this, watch
[47:51] him
[47:53] and and and and he's and he's saying,
[47:54] "Behold, thou desest truth in the inward
[47:56] part and in the hidden part, thou shalt
[47:58] make me to to know wisdom. Purge me with
[48:01] hissip and I shall be clean. Wash me and
[48:05] I shall be white like snow."
[48:09] &gt;&gt; You look at that beautiful snow out
[48:11] there and how beautiful it is. God can.
[48:14] So God, that's the way he looks at us
[48:16] when we repent of our sins.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; We're just as white and beautiful.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, THE MESSAGE HAS COME to us.
[48:28] Oh, aren't you glad that God sent us a
[48:30] messenger in this day
[48:32] &gt;&gt; when it was all muddled again where the
[48:35] Bible says, the Bible says that this
[48:38] day, Amen. is you you make the profane
[48:41] holy and the holy things profane. In
[48:45] other words, YOU'VE GOT IT SO MIXED UP
[48:47] UNTIL WHEN YOU when we YOU JUST DON'T
[48:50] KNOW UNTIL UNTIL YOU TELL A woman it is
[48:55] wrong. It is sinful for you to wear a
[48:57] pants. She says, "I love God just like I
[49:00] am." And that Well, no matter what the
[49:03] Bible says,
[49:04] &gt;&gt; you can say, "Amen." Well, uh, you you
[49:07] you can say, "THE BIBLE SAYS BE BAPTIZED
[49:10] IN JESUS' NAME." And and they'll say,
[49:13] "No, no, I'm I'm going to be baptized in
[49:16] the Trinity." AND YOU SAY, "WELL, THAT'S
[49:19] NOT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE BIBLE EVER
[49:21] baptized that way." See, it's so mixed
[49:24] up. IT'S SO MUDDLED. AMEN. Until
[49:28] everything is just whatever goes. Until
[49:32] the word of God doesn't have an effect.
[49:34] But yet it is God's word. Amen. The word
[49:38] was made flesh. It was the blood cell of
[49:41] the word that come to cleanse us. It
[49:44] cleanses us on the inside. And how do
[49:47] you know that you're cleansed on the
[49:49] inside? By looking at the word ON THIS
[49:52] THIS THIS WRITTEN PAGE. And when you
[49:55] look and your inside begins to agree
[49:58] with what is written, then you can say,
[50:01] "Ah, there's something pure. God's doing
[50:05] something with me."
[50:07] &gt;&gt; But we were going, we were living in a
[50:09] day and God says right before, Amen. the
[50:12] destruction is going to take place. I'm
[50:15] going to send you an Elijah and he is
[50:18] going to be a faithful messenger and
[50:21] he's going to point you back to this
[50:24] right here. Why? I want you to be pure.
[50:28] Did you know that brother Brandham says
[50:30] when you believe the word of God, he
[50:33] says you are being washed by the washing
[50:36] of the bloody bleeding word. AMEN.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD CELL THAT MAKES YOU WHITE. THE
[50:44] BLOOD CELL THAT MAKES YOU WHITE BECOME
[50:47] AMEN. become flesh to die for us. It was
[50:51] the word. Well, praise the Lord.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, look at look at what it's
[50:56] done for us there in First John 3 and2.
[50:59] BELOVED, NOW ARE we the sons of God. Not
[51:02] when we get to heaven.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be sons when WE GET
[51:06] TO HEAVEN. NOW, WE are the sons of God,
[51:10] and it doesn't yet appear what we shall
[51:13] be, but we know that when he appears,
[51:15] we're going to be like him. Why? Because
[51:18] the blood cell has been. We've been
[51:20] washed. The messenger has come. WE HAVE
[51:22] ACCEPTED HIS MESSAGE. We understand
[51:24] where he's at. Now, watch. He says, "We
[51:26] know that when he shall appear, we shall
[51:27] be like him, for we shall be as he is.
[51:29] And every man that has this hope in him
[51:31] purifith himself even as he is pure."
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[51:37] Why? Because God has made us righteous.
[51:42] Did you know that that that when Daniel
[51:44] seen seen the ancient of days, God when
[51:48] he seen him in his theophony body, Amen.
[51:51] There there in in in the heavens, he
[51:54] says that he has had a garment on as
[51:58] white as snow.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Now, you say, "Well, what does that?"
[52:02] Well, good. Well, white as snow. Okay.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; White as snow means a lot.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; White as snow means no sin.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; WHITE AS SNOW MEANS PURITY. WHITE AS
[52:14] SNOW. DID YOU KNOW THAT when we that
[52:18] that the righteousness that is given to
[52:20] us is white?
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Beautiful garments of God.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; So God's got a garment white as snow.
[52:30] And in Revelations 21, the the Bible
[52:33] says, amen, that he has given us or 19,
[52:36] Revelations uh uh uh well, let me just
[52:39] let me just read this to you. Daniel 7
[52:40] and N I beheld till the thrones were
[52:43] cast down, the ancient of days did sit,
[52:46] whose garment was white as snow, and the
[52:50] hair of his head with like pure wool,
[52:53] his throne like the fiery flame, and his
[52:56] wheels as burning fire. Did you know
[53:00] that this was the revelation that God
[53:02] was was was going to do in these last
[53:05] days when all the kingdoms come tumbling
[53:06] down and we're connected with it? And
[53:09] Revelations 19:7, let us be glad and
[53:12] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[53:15] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[53:17] wife has made herself ready and to her
[53:20] is granted that she should be raised in
[53:24] fine linen clean AND WHITE. AMEN. Thank
[53:29] you, Lord.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Just like our messenger that came to us.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Just like our messenger that came,
[53:39] righteousness. What? Can you say amen?
[53:42] &gt;&gt; White like snow. Beautiful. God makes
[53:45] all things beautiful. Amen. If we have a
[53:48] smutty heart here this morning and maybe
[53:50] maybe our heart isn't quite right. You
[53:53] say, "Well, I just have a hard time
[53:54] living the Christian life." Oh my
[53:57] friend, let me be a messenger. Let me be
[53:59] one of those FEET THAT ARE RUNNING OUT
[54:02] DECLARING PEACE TO YOU. PEACE. YOU CAN
[54:06] HAVE PEACE IN YOUR HEART. YOU CAN HAVE
[54:08] PEACE IN YOUR MIND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[54:10] STRUGGLE WITH GOD ANYMORE because the
[54:13] messenger, HE GAVE HIS LIFE. THE PRINCE
[54:16] OF PEACE, THE KING'S SON, HAS COME AND
[54:20] GAVE HIS life
[54:23] &gt;&gt; so that you can be pure, clean, and
[54:25] wine.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Well, that makes me just want to shout
[54:31] hallelujah.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Purity. See, God will put that in
[54:37] our hearts and and and we don't want to
[54:38] come to church and just for a
[54:40] motivational time. I mean, why why come
[54:43] to church? Amen. to just do that. And a
[54:47] lot of times people just you and you
[54:49] kids can do that too. You can get busy
[54:52] uh uh doing your own things and and and
[54:54] and coloring your in your books and
[54:56] writing and whatever and and not and and
[54:59] not really understand that maybe the
[55:01] messenger may be knocking at your heart
[55:03] today and the messenger is saying I love
[55:06] you. I love you. Amen. And and and
[55:10] trying to let us know these things. Are
[55:11] are you understanding? because he's it
[55:13] well there's no there's no difference
[55:15] whether we're little kids or whether
[55:16] we're old people. No, we are his
[55:19] children and his message is I want you
[55:22] to be pure and holy. Well, can you say
[55:24] amen?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; First John 3 and 7 it says, "Little
[55:29] children, let no man deceive you. He
[55:32] that doeth righteousness is righteous."
[55:35] Think about that, BOYS AND GIRLS, MAMAS
[55:38] AND DADDIES, THAT GOD CAN SAY you're
[55:41] doing righteous because you are
[55:44] righteous.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; You have desires. Oh, does that mean
[55:48] that we don't sin? No. That means when
[55:50] we do sin, we're very We're not going to
[55:52] hide it. We're not going to hide it
[55:53] again. We're not going to hide our
[55:55] iniquities. We're not going to hide or
[55:57] No, no, no, no. We just simply bring it
[55:59] before God. Amen. And I don't know how
[56:02] he does it. Hallelujah. But he drops it
[56:05] down in his blood and we come out white
[56:08] as snow.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; And he says this, the Bible says that
[56:16] there in 1 John
[56:18] uh uh uh uh 3 and1 I I believe it is is
[56:23] in in and you know I say that you sin
[56:27] not. that if you do sin, we have an
[56:32] advocate with the father, Christ Jesus
[56:35] the righteous.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; The righteous,
[56:39] righteousness like snow. Come on. Sins
[56:43] is scarlet. Amen. Righteousness like
[56:46] snow. He that doeth righteousness is
[56:49] righteous even as he is righteous. He
[56:51] that committh sin is of the devil. For
[56:53] the devil sins from the beginning, for
[56:55] the for this purpose the Son of God was
[56:58] manifested that he might destroy the
[57:00] works of the devil. Whosoever is born of
[57:03] God does not commit sin, for his seed
[57:06] remains in him, and he cannot sin
[57:11] because he is born of God. You go,
[57:15] Brother Wendle. Amen. Oh my.
[57:19] Well, I think we all sin. But here's the
[57:22] secret. Amen. The old heart of unbelief
[57:26] that says, "No, I'm not going to obey
[57:29] God. I'm not going to I'm not going to
[57:32] throw away my pants or I'm not going to
[57:35] No, I'm not going to I'm going Listen,
[57:37] I've not got caught when I've stolen the
[57:39] the the the
[57:42] uh uh the gum. I've not got I Well,
[57:46] that's sin. That and and God says, "No,
[57:49] you you you've not been born again yet."
[57:52] But when you make a mistake, your heart
[57:55] grieves and you go,
[57:59] "I knew better and I shouldn't have."
[58:01] And mama, I'm sorry. And and and you
[58:04] might you might get your your my mama
[58:07] used to say your tan your your hide
[58:09] tanned. Amen. and uh uh get get a
[58:12] whooping and but but what you're doing
[58:15] is is you are you are admitting that
[58:18] you're wrong. Why? Because that soul on
[58:21] the inside says, "No, I'm not a sinner."
[58:24] The soul is no longer a sinner. It's
[58:26] righteous. And a righteous soul is not
[58:28] going to let you get by with sin.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; A righteous soul, can you say amen? Then
[58:35] you know you're born of God. God's Holy
[58:38] Spirit within you is saying no, no, no,
[58:41] no, no. Well, praise the Lord. Is that
[58:43] right?
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we we want to and and that
[58:47] righteousness and we I want to read one
[58:49] more place before I go on uh uh go on
[58:52] further here. there in Titus 2 and 11.
[58:55] It says, "For the grace of God that
[58:57] brings salvation has appeared to all
[59:00] men, teaching us that denying
[59:04] ungodliness and worldly lust, we should
[59:07] live soberly, righteously, godly in this
[59:11] present world, looking for that blessed
[59:15] hope and the glorious appearing of the
[59:18] great God and our savior Jesus Christ,
[59:21] who gave himself for us. Someone say
[59:25] hallelujah.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; That he might redeem US FROM ALL
[59:30] INIQUITY.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And purify
[59:34] unto himself a peculiar people zealous
[59:40] of good works.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; There's something about that soul that
[59:45] God makes pure. You just want to please
[59:49] him.
[59:50] You want to do that which is honorable
[59:54] to him. Your heart wants that. Amen. And
[59:58] you're and the Bible says you're
[59:59] zealous. You're you're you're passionate
[1:00:02] about being a Christian. You're
[1:00:04] passionate about living for God. You're
[1:00:06] passionate this word. You want to
[1:00:09] display God in everything that you do.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought of another thing as as
[1:00:19] we as as as as I get ready. Not going to
[1:00:22] hold you long this morning, but the the
[1:00:24] the another thing about the snow IS IS
[1:00:28] GOD GOD ALSO I I I THOUGHT ABOUT how
[1:00:32] that uh uh we are one body,
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; but we are many members.

[1:00:41] WHOLE BUNCH OF US. AMEN. We're all
[1:00:45] individuals here. And uh but we make up
[1:00:49] the church, the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:52] There there in 1 Corinthians 12:20 says,
[1:00:55] "You are the body of Christ and members
[1:01:00] in particular." Now, uh and and Caleb,
[1:01:04] if you'd go out there and and and u get

[1:01:10] it right out there by my door. And and I

[1:01:15] Hallelujah.
[1:01:16] And then um uh and then Sister Leah
[1:01:19] brought me a a magnifying glass. I think
[1:01:22] the magnifying glass may be I think I

[1:02:00] we have here. And um so
[1:02:06] we we and it and it and it and it looks
[1:02:08] so gorgeous. It just sparkles. You you
[1:02:09] can see it sparkling in in in the light.
[1:02:12] It just sort of sparkles. That's
[1:02:13] beautiful. But you know, do you realize
[1:02:15] that this snow is all made up of little
[1:02:18] flakes? And you can see it when you look
[1:02:21] down. You can just see all the little

[1:04:35] Those little little bitty things. You
[1:04:37] see it?
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:04:41] So,
[1:04:42] God has made us Well, come up here and
[1:04:46] I'll show you real quick, Noah. Anyway,
[1:04:49] and and God has has made us the same
[1:04:52] way.
[1:04:56] And uh
[1:05:01] you see can you see those little bitty
[1:05:03] flex little bitty ones down in there?
[1:05:05] See it? It just makes it so cute.
[1:05:10] Now we Hey, these boys. Um they've been
[1:05:15] helping me a little bit. These these
[1:05:17] young uh we had I had Micah and Uriah
[1:05:21] and Noah helping me the other day at the
[1:05:23] fellowship hall. And I'm here to tell
[1:05:24] you, uh, you guys, you you you guys will
[1:05:28] be amazed what they done once you see
[1:05:29] it. But the, um, so so the Oh, yes. And
[1:05:33] then and then
[1:05:36] and then we also have uh a help from
[1:05:39] from these older ones, too. And they're,
[1:05:42] you know, we're we're just blessed to
[1:05:43] have great great kids. Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; We we're just blessed to have such great
[1:05:49] kids
[1:05:52] that that that help us as we work and
[1:05:55] and uh and we appreciate all of them.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; We all matter. All of our personalities
[1:06:02] matter and and as the snow I I couldn't
[1:06:05] I you know it the uh bringing it inside.
[1:06:08] You can do it outside. You can do the
[1:06:10] experiment. and and uh I got this from
[1:06:13] Sister Leah uh uh the the the the
[1:06:16] magnifying glass, but outside when you
[1:06:18] look at there is no snowflake. If you
[1:06:21] separate them out there in the cold,
[1:06:23] there is no snowflake that is the same.
[1:06:26] They're all different.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Every snowflake is different. And how
[1:06:32] many millions of snowflake do y'all
[1:06:35] think's in this?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And they're all so different.
[1:06:41] See, God makes us different,
[1:06:45] but we're all righteous
[1:06:49] through the messenger Jesus Christ. And
[1:06:53] that's why it's so that's why we have
[1:06:55] Sunday school. That's why we have
[1:06:58] different preachers more than just me
[1:07:00] preaching. more than just uh uh brother
[1:07:03] Michael, brother KBY, brother John more.
[1:07:07] Why? Why is we want every message God
[1:07:10] has sends messenger after messenger
[1:07:13] after messenger to make sure we get the
[1:07:17] good news
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; to make sure that you understand that
[1:07:22] you can be righteous. So, if there's
[1:07:25] someone here and you're amen, you're
[1:07:27] dabbling in sin, you're playing in sin,
[1:07:31] you're in open rebellion against the
[1:07:33] word of God, I say today, be pure. How
[1:07:38] do we do it, God? As as as God says, let
[1:07:42] let's come together. Remember the
[1:07:44] scripture I just read, come, let us
[1:07:46] reason together. Though your sins be as
[1:07:49] scarlet, they'll be as white as snow.
[1:07:54] Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; I I I just I just love it.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; I just love it. And And so here the
[1:08:00] Bible says there in in in 1 Corinthians
[1:08:03] 12 and um uh 12 and and one
[1:08:08] or 12 and 20. But now they are many
[1:08:12] members but one body. Now this like that
[1:08:14] snow. The eye cannot say to the hand, I
[1:08:17] have no need of you. Neither can the
[1:08:20] head to the feet, I have no need of you.
[1:08:23] Nay, much more those members of the body
[1:08:26] which seem to be more feeble are
[1:08:29] necessary.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; So one of you girls can say, "Well, I
[1:08:32] can sing good. Huh? I can sing better
[1:08:35] than her. I can sing better than him."
[1:08:38] And the other one says, "Well, I'm
[1:08:39] prettier than you." And see that those
[1:08:42] are those No, God makes us all
[1:08:45] different.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not everybody can can be the
[1:08:49] same thing. And we don't want everybody
[1:08:51] to the same thing. I mean, we cannot
[1:08:54] have everyone good-looking like me.
[1:08:58] What? That wasn't a good Okay, I'm
[1:09:00] sorry. Amen. So, those girls have their
[1:09:03] mouths open going, "Hallelujah." So,
[1:09:06] that's a bad illustration.
[1:09:08] Not everyone can be good-looking like
[1:09:10] those girls. Is that better? Okay. Amen.
[1:09:15] So, uh it it you we we're all different.
[1:09:22] But we're all righteous.
[1:09:25] What that means is there's no one that's
[1:09:27] going to discount sin. And God can never
[1:09:30] discount sin from us. What he expects
[1:09:33] from you is what he expects from me.
[1:09:35] What he expects from me. No. Sin is sin.
[1:09:38] And you're going to go to hell if you
[1:09:39] don't fix it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; But yet God comes in and get the
[1:09:44] messenger. And he's screaming out,
[1:09:46] "Here's my word. Take it." In the last
[1:09:49] day, what did he say? He would send us a
[1:09:51] prophet and then also there in
[1:09:53] Revelations it says he himself would
[1:09:56] come down in Revelations the 10th
[1:09:57] chapter WOULD COME DOWN WITH an open
[1:09:58] book and he would say eat it. Eat it.
[1:10:02] Eat the book. I want you to eat this so
[1:10:04] that you can become messengers of
[1:10:06] righteousness. God wants us to be
[1:10:09] righteous. He has sent us this message.
[1:10:13] Amen. See, so you kids just thought you
[1:10:16] weren't going to have Sunday school.
[1:10:17] Well, you have Sunday school yet right
[1:10:18] now because I'm doing Sunday school.
[1:10:20] Praise the Lord. And and so so he wants
[1:10:23] us TO BE RIGHT. GOD SENT US THE PROPHET.
[1:10:28] And then 1963
[1:10:30] when those seven angels come down and
[1:10:33] gave gave the revelation to the seven
[1:10:36] seals, the Bible when when God wanted to
[1:10:39] show it in a mystery form, now we went
[1:10:41] and we heard these sermons of of the
[1:10:45] the seven seals open. But when God
[1:10:47] wanted to show us in a in a in make it
[1:10:49] easy for us to understand, he said,
[1:10:51] "It's going to be the mighty angel,
[1:10:53] which was Christ." And he's going to
[1:10:55] come and he's going to open the book and
[1:10:58] then he's going to hand it to you and
[1:11:00] he's going to say, "Eat it."
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Why? He wants us to be righteous,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; He wants us to be righteous. That's what
[1:11:06] he wants. So listen,
[1:11:09] we can be righteous. Just take him at
[1:11:11] his word.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Live this word. Amen. Not not not not in
[1:11:17] just on the outside. Only you know
[1:11:20] what's on the inside.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Only you know what's here. You know what
[1:11:24] you're craving here. You know what's
[1:11:27] here.
[1:11:29] And the Holy Spirit also if he's there
[1:11:32] then he starts convicting us.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; The great messenger of God.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So how how was that
[1:11:39] Sunday school lesson?
[1:11:45] Hallelujah.
[1:11:49] This is not a good time to walk out.
[1:11:52] Amen. Well, I got I got an applause from
[1:11:54] everyone and one walking out. Amen.
[1:11:58] But uh uh so so God is is definitely
[1:12:02] definitely good to us. I I I want How
[1:12:05] many of you kiddos want to be righteous?
[1:12:09] As God is righteous. Hallelujah. in this
[1:12:12] age where where where there's so much
[1:12:16] there's so much uh uh inferiority
[1:12:19] complexes. So many complexes and u Amen.
[1:12:23] And we and and we've got we've got
[1:12:26] psychologists and psychiatrists and oh
[1:12:28] man they're making a lot of money trying
[1:12:30] to make people feel good about
[1:12:31] themselves. And uh but you can't. It's
[1:12:35] not going to work because if you've got
[1:12:38] that sin nature on the inside of you, it
[1:12:40] just doesn't quite Amen. That's
[1:12:43] Hallelujah. like putting lipstick on a
[1:12:45] pig or something. And but what we want
[1:12:48] we we want we want God to make this
[1:12:53] clean. And when he does this,
[1:12:58] everything begins. Now, we still fight
[1:12:59] in our mind. We do. But at least we have
[1:13:02] this reality in our hearts. Can you say
[1:13:06] amen? If the musicians would come. Glory
[1:13:09] to God.
[1:13:11] Amen.
[1:13:12] Amen. Amen. I I love him here this
[1:13:15] morning.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; God is so good. Why don't we just sing
[1:13:21] that song? God is so good.
[1:13:26] God God
[1:13:30] is so good.
[1:13:36] God
[1:13:38] is so good.
[1:13:44] God
[1:13:46] is so good.
[1:13:50] He spoke me
[1:13:54] to.
[1:13:56] And why don't we say I love him so? I
[1:14:02] love him so.
[1:14:07] I
[1:14:09] love him so.
[1:14:13] Yeah. Yeah. You're young and singing
[1:14:14] with us now. I
[1:14:17] love him. So,
[1:14:21] he's so good
[1:14:25] to
[1:14:27] me.
[1:14:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:36] Praise the Lord. Messengers are just
[1:14:39] just incredible and so neat. It's so
[1:14:42] neat to know and see what God how good
[1:14:44] God has been.
[1:14:48] looking at all of you pretty kids and
[1:14:51] and sledding with a bunch of you
[1:14:53] yesterday.
[1:14:55] I uh
[1:15:00] I thought, you know,
[1:15:06] it is it is so it it's it's so special
[1:15:12] that
[1:15:14] that God would make sure that you all
[1:15:17] are raised in Christian homes
[1:15:20] and that you have mamas and daddies that
[1:15:23] love
[1:15:24] We got Sunday school teachers. You've
[1:15:26] got
[1:15:29] God's just really been good to us.
[1:15:33] Really been good to us.
[1:15:38] And we look out and around and when you
[1:15:41] go out there and look at the snow,
[1:15:47] I believe maybe God might have sent a
[1:15:48] little sent some messengers to us
[1:15:51] through the snow.
[1:15:54] And when you look at that snow and
[1:15:56] you're out there playing and the purity
[1:15:58] of the snow, say just
[1:16:02] I'm just as righteous and pure as this
[1:16:06] snow.
[1:16:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:14] Hallelujah.
[1:16:15] Isn't that Isn't that just wonderful
[1:16:18] that he loves us so much?
[1:16:24] Why Why do people not spend time in
[1:16:26] prayer? Is because they feel like maybe
[1:16:30] your kids and maybe God it's for the
[1:16:33] adults. Why do adults not spend time in
[1:16:36] prayer?
[1:16:38] uh lots of reasons, but some big reasons
[1:16:43] is when they go to prayer, they sort of
[1:16:46] feel icky and yucky a little bit and I
[1:16:49] don't know if I'm worthy. And
[1:16:52] let's just wipe that all out.
[1:16:56] Let's come before the Lord with the
[1:16:58] righteousness that Jesus gave us.
[1:17:01] They're beautiful clothes.
[1:17:03] Let's sing it to him again. God is so
[1:17:05] good. Oh,
[1:17:08] God
[1:17:10] is so good.
[1:17:16] God
[1:17:18] is so good.
[1:17:24] God
[1:17:26] is so good.
[1:17:30] He's so good
[1:17:34] to
[1:17:35] me.
[1:17:40] God
[1:17:42] answers
[1:17:43] prayer.
[1:17:48] God
[1:17:50] answers prayer.
[1:17:55] God
[1:17:58] answers
[1:17:59] prayer.

[1:18:05] to
[1:18:07] me.

[1:18:46] and we uh we work together. We play
[1:18:51] together. We we rejoice with one another
[1:18:56] because he's made us all one body.
