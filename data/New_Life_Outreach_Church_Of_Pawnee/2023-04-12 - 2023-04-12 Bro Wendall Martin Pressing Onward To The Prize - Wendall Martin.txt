heard they had a good time man and so I'm just curious do uh I know I know for sure we had three of them go do y'all y'all have a testimony man say what won't you won't y'all sit down for a moment we're just gonna we're gonna ask these uh that now y'all can't preach but uh but we'll let them come and give a testimony Sister Sister Naomi you want to start it off you've got a mic there but uh and you can stands yes okay well I don't know this was a little different for me I went there and it's like as soon as I got into Camp it's like I just couldn't focus on nothing like sit in the services and I'm trying to get into it but the devil is just fighting me on on a lot of stuff it's just trying to sit there and distract me as I can just be looking around I'm like I should be paying attention and trying to write down notes but um but um then I really got down to it I'm like Lord You're Gonna to help me it's like I want to get something out of camp and probably one probably one of the deepest desires I had was just to get a refilling of the Holy Spirit and I believe that happened for me so so really excited about that [Applause] sister Debbie do you have a testimony I'll bring the mic to you so you don't have to stand up in front of everybody praise the Lord um I know for me I did not have plans to go to Louisiana um and someone just kind of um opened up their heart to kind of pay for me to go there so um so I knew God kind of wanted me to be there even though I didn't intend to originally and um all the services were just so powerful the word and especially Saturday night I think what Naomi was saying was truly special and seeing people just get healed and delivered um and even for me just um I was just truly Desiring to have a refilling of the Holy Spirit and God met me where I was sat so amen praises the Lord amen we just we uh we love all of our young people [Applause] um I've had this problem in my back I was born with 32 bones in my spine instead of 33 and it's kind of given me problems I would have like a constant ache in my back and it really bothered me so I went up to get prayed for and I the egg went away and on my way back I just kind of I had this weird feeling like the spot on my back which was usually aching It's usually the spot that's in between the bones well I felt it and there was a bump there so I felt my back and I actually have 33 bumps in my spine I'm completely healed from that so the Lord put a rib that missing rib he put that rib in there and I and I was a powerful testimony when I heard that testimony I thought what a glorious amen God's still the Creator and and the prophet told us these days that the Holy Spirit would um uh that the Holy Spirit would uh uh that we would have limbs grow and and and and I I just believe we're living in that day can you say man and so we're we're sure thankful sure thankful for that heard there was just wonderful um a wonderful meeting and so we're we're sure thankful to see our people blessed and we appreciate um brother brother Tim Pruitt brother Timothy Pruitt and the guys who put that on down there we say God richly blessed them good to see brother Ken with us tonight amen Hallelujah we thought he quit church and started going to the Baptist or something amen but uh we're sure glad uh to have brother Ken uh you're feeling better amen he had fallen and and uh and messed up some ribs and then had a had a got sick on top of that and with his coughing and and so we're just we're so glad to see you're doing better just good to see everyone uh here tonight amen let's look here in in Philippians 3 and 12. we thank the musicians and um amen we are thankful we're still Dad we he took him into the chiropractor on Monday and and I tell you what I I it made things worse so he's got a big old knot on his back and and he can't get in until tomorrow and so he's been in severe pain and so um I know they would appreciate uh that they would appreciate the uh the prayer for Dad amen uh Philippians 3 and 12. not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do for hitting those things which are behind reaching forth into those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus forgetting the things that are behind I'm looking to the goal and I'm pressing toward that price father we want to thank you tonight for your blessings and we are thankful for our for the past what you have done for us you've been good but Lord we're we've still got a prize that is ahead of us and I'm praying Lord that you would that you would bless us tonight and bless your word help your servant Lord keep keep my thoughts focused on what you want me to say father and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen you may be seated here this evening amen pressing onward to the prize and um amen I I want to in order to press forward you've got to leave the things which are behind so you can't look at the things behind you've got to look forward amen and and I as I um was listening to that song Amen Jesus is in the room and and I I'm thankful this morning or this evening to to be in a place where Jesus is amen how many feels this presence and and I I I I I feel his presence and I but I you that's that's not just enough I want to I want him to see me I want to know that he knows that I am here can you say amen amen in order to press amen there's got to do you there's got to be a clear a a a clear reality in your heart in your mind and if you want to be seen of God then you've got to reach out by faith to God if our goal is to see God here tonight amen then then our then our every effort my every desire is to get in the place where he is at and not just get in the place where he is at but we want to have his attention draw him to me amen you remember the king of England uh when he went to visit Canada and going through Vancouver and and all of the schools had let out and and uh they were having a uh a prayed as he was as he was coming through the streets and the teachers had given the the students Flags to wave and and the little kids were just a waving and screaming out God Save the King you know and and and uh but after the king had passed and and all of the kids had all dispersed the crowd of dispersed with one teacher had had missed uh uh you know they were missing a little girl and and so she goes back out and she's trying frantically looking for her and and and there she is with her with her head up against a telephone pole and she's crying and and and she said what what are you crying for and uh she said what's wrong did did you not get to see the king and the little girl says yeah I I saw the king she said did you did you wave your flag yeah I was my flag that then why are you crying and the little girl says because the king didn't see me the king didn't see me and I I I I that that is something that is that is that is incredible because there are many people who are going to church tonight there are many people who are following Christ for many different reasons there's amen they follow they followed him for uh you know that there were Skeptics there to find fault there were uh Smitty that were simply curious as to what is going on there are some that come to church that that that are just here uh maybe for the music or for the youth program or for him you know there there's the multitudes are innumerable of of people who are who are are are are are searching after Christ amen but there is a desire for the elect not just to come into His presence but we want to catch his attention amen I want to come to church to catch his attention amen I think that's that's that's do what that you know it doesn't matter what we hear it doesn't matter the sermons we we hear or the amen the music we hear or the people that we rub the shoulders with but what matters is I must have his attention friends I don't want to leave the church tonight and not have the attention of the Lord can you say man there's many that are that are amen desire the kingdom the multitudes are outreaching for the supernatural just as they throng Jesus but the elect is looking for something that is of Great Value amen and and the scripture says there in in Matthew 11 and 12 Jesus said from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force amen so this is something that is telling me you can be in his presence and not have his attention you can come to church and just be dull and numb and whatever but there's going to be somebody who is going to reach out after Christ and get his attention come on can you say Amen now coming in contact with God there's a difference between being Amen in his presence and and and and and and and coming in contact with him there were thousands present when the when the woman with the issue of blood was there amen and and the day that she was healed but the scripture says that the woman had to pass through the crowd in order to get there I wonder tonight how many's got that desire Amen to press through whatever to get there into the presence of the Lord now listen just to come to church and mine and just to sing the songs and knowing that he's in our midst because the scripture says he's in our midst that's not exactly amen of what I'm interested in I want to feel his touch upon my life I want to know that his presence is with me I've got to know a man that when he touches me because when the supernatural touches you something is going to happen when the supernatural touches you amen there is nothing that will ever be the same well can you say amen amen and I want to tell you tonight if you've got a hungry heart you will never leave him to the scripture says open your mouth wide and I will fill it Lord glory to God Amen it's not that he's not here it's not that he doesn't have the answer all he's needing is somebody to open those mouths wide amen I I've you know we've we've we've rescued a few birds that have came out of Nest you know and they matter and they're they're pretty interesting characters when you get up close to him and you and you're going to give them a little worm or something amen those mouths are they they open a wider than their head is in size I mean they just open so wide and and you drop the little worm in there but once they get satisfied I don't care if you put the worm Amen on them and you try to open the beak and you you do everything they're not going to open their mouth you've got to have your mouth open wide in order for you to get fever you've got to come with desire if you're going to receive you've got to put your effort in open your mouth wide well how many's got their mouths open wide tonight feed me Lord amen share with me Lord amen give me what you have a Believers amen Fanny Crosby who wrote the song Pass Me Not O Gentle Savior hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by amen I've come with desire I'm coming with a heart that's wanting more I want more of the Lord as the scripture says or is the song that we sing I need more of you that's the way it's got gotta be I need more of you amen can you say amen amen there in Isaiah 55 and 6 it says seek ye the Lord while he may be found and call ye upon him while he is near acts 17 and 27 that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far away from everyone can you say Amen so coming in contact with him is not just it's it's not enough I want to catch his attention can you say man amount now Jesus he he gave us the story a man there in Luke the 11th chapter starting about the fifth verse and he's mine and he's asking he says now which of you would have a friend and that came over to visit you and you didn't have any you didn't have any bread there was no food there to feed him and he says which one of you a man wouldn't go to your neighbor and start knocking on the door and amen at midnight and say yeah amen I'm needing I'm needing to feed my hungry friend he's come from a far country amen they're here I I want to feed them amen and the guy is in his bed this Jesus is telling the story he says his children's in his bed everyone's in bed and the man you know he's he's hollering out the house from his bed saying leave me alone I'm I'm already in bed I'm tucked away I don't want to get up and be but he says but because the continual knocking because of his importunity because he would not quit knocking he kept born banging he kept on asking he kept on doing it until the man got up and gave him what his desire was what can you say man amen that and there in the eighth verse there amen they're in Luke 11 and 8. he says I say unto you though he will not raise and give him because he is a friend yet because of his importunity or his continual knocking he will rise and give him as many as he needeth and I say unto you ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and the door will be open unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth he that seeketh finds and to him that knocketh it shall be open unto you amen it's your desire it's it's what you have it's your craving amen your desire you're willing to press to to the mark that you're Desiring now are you hearing me you're not going to get there coasting you're not going to get there with church attendance you're not going to get there amen just being an average blowjo you have got to have desire to reach his attention amen now you've got to know that when you get his attention he's going to be there you got to know that when you when you get his attention he's got everything you have need he has your healing he has your Miracle he has your answer he has everything can you say amen amen Jesus would go on down and say Amen now now which of you I if I can find it here he says he said yeah he says in the 11th verse he says if you shall ask bread if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will you give him a stone if he asks a fish will you give him a a serpent if he asks an egg will you give him a scorpion if ye fan being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more someone say how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask for it amen so so what is it if the desire is there and the willingness to pray now Jesus is telling you it's not going to come easy he's telling you now this is Jesus he's the one amen he's the one who has all of the answers he has all of the healing but he's telling you sometimes you're going to have to knock and knock and knock and knock and ask and ask and ask and ask you're going to have to amen keep on and on and on but it's your persistence that's going to bring God on the scene how bad do you want God in your life Hallelujah can you see man now man there's many who had to push through the crowd what a lesson that little woman that was pressing through the crowd she had to press pass all of the indifference to get to that crowd brother brother Harry brought a beautiful lesson on that last Wednesday night amen some people are just satisfied being in his presence some people are satisfied just showing up to church some people are just satisfied amen taking up room on a Pew amen some people are satisfied just critiquing the preacher amen and and finding all of his nouns and pronouns that he's missing in quest scriptures he's misquoting or whatever amen but I want to tell you there is somebody that's going to say I want Jesus right here on a Wednesday night right here on a Wednesday night somebody's going to say I've got to get his attention I've got to get his attention I've got to get his attention I must get his attention can you say amen amen oh yes oh yes I know I I know that I've been in his presence but tonight amen I want to know that he sees me amen hallelujah now you're going to have to push past the spirit of this age it's the spirit of lukewarmness it's the spirit of laxness it's the spirit of indifference it's the spirit of busy busy busy amen but you've got to settle down at his feet and get his attention can you say man oh yes now there's many who come to church and they go away and amen they're not really the same brother Branham would compare him amen with the chicken those kind of chickens that you or those kind of eggs that you eat amen he says those those eggs there amen the mama and daddy you know Mama didn't didn't have the germ of life from Daddy amen and so uh uh as she's laying eggs but there's no life in the ax there's no way for the for the egg to hatch there's no Revival in it there's no life in it what can you save man and we don't want to just come to church and amen and so all the music was good and all that no no no no I want us the Son of God I want his word to impregnate my heart and I want you something up here I don't want just an emotion I want the presence of God in Me O Church of God I think this generation needs a greater desire for more of God Amen oh yes it's wonderful amen when you've got the people there at the youth camper amen of all meetings and and the presence of the Lord is wonderful and we're all jumping and shouting amen but I but when we get back to our regular church service amen where's the press it shows that we were just more interested Amen in the emotion of what was going on if you are if you've got it here amen tonight it'll be the exact same emotion that you have at a youth camp it's the exact same emotion that you have amen at another service you if you jump up in a regular service you'll jump up in a youth camp and you'll jump up and well praise the Lord why because it's desire and you know that you've got to get his attention praise the Lord I believe we can have I believe we can have special meetings year-round I believe we can have healings year around I believe we can have Miracles year round I believe we can I believe we don't even have to be in church to have Miracles I believe we can have Miracles at home I believe we can have miracles on the job why because desire desire I must get his attention can you say Amen yes amen and in order to have a birth there must be a getting with the mate so you could a a a hymn and the atmosphere of the hen a man can sit on that egg until the hen just dies but if there's nothing in the egg it's never going to hatch well praise the Lord hey can you say Amen so the atmosphere is great but that don't create chickens amen the atmosphere is great but we have got to get the attention of the one that can terminate the heart well praise the Lord amen that's the reason why some people can come and when the atmosphere is so powerful and and and it just goes right back to normal amen after a week or two whereas the other when the inspiration of God is hovering over the building amen something is germinating within them there's something why revival is in their heart amen he says I think each Christian ought to do that before you come out and confess the Holy Ghost and confess you have the baptism they're ought to be such a personal contact with God until all the intellectuals in the world can't explain it from you you know you've been there you've had the witness you know it so that's a requirement Jesus told the disciples you wait you know the intellectual part you know the word but you wait up there at that city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and then they really knew can you say amen amen every man or woman that has an experience with God has met that same Pillar of Fire upon the secret grounds of your heart there's no Theologian no devil

prize I've been placed here in this seven Church age Amen to possess a Rapture I've been placed here amen not to be not to just be lukewarm and lacks but I've been placed here to be red hot on fire for god brother Branham says amen when the question was asked about being a witness he meant how will you judge the world he says the way you're going to judge the world is you will be a witness to those who have been around you the way you've lived your life your attitude toward the gospel the great big movie screen will be played and those people who you have been in contact with they will they will know that Christ lives because of your desire and love for him that you live before can you say amen amen so God I am pressing on the upward way amen or can you say man when you get that sweet Holy Ghost there's something that just Jesus it's just you know Jesus put it this way he says out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water he said something is going to just Bubble Up out of you there in John 4 and 14. he says whoever drinks with water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up Hallelujah unto everlasting life amen John 7 and 38 he that believes on me as the scripture is set out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water well praise the Lord you get a powerful River and you've got hundreds of gallons of Amen water coming through per second well you can't put a damn over that thing amen you put a damn around that thing it's going to blow that damn right out why because there is a power behind the water that is pushing it there is a force well glory to God why can't you amen why why is it that the Church of God Amen the resistance is there how many feels the resistance in your life amen that when brother when when the scripture says the spirit of the ages laxness and lukewarmness and Jesus said I would rather you either be on fire for God or be just an absolute ranked sinner but because you're lukewarm I'm going to spew you out of my mouth now that's a serious situation so what is he telling us the elect is going to have to fight resistance well praise the Lord you say well I just don't believe that I just I just believe there ain't no resistance for the elect well how is your prayer life how is your prayer life I mean you you get down every morning amount and before you know it you have already prayed an hour and a half two hours and you and you're getting up and no there's resistance how many how many just just you your heart you you're just looking forward to Bible study and you get so engrossed in Bible study that you've read amen not just one chapter or one verse or one line of the verse amen you you have you you have read the whole book and and halfway through another book and and wait a minute no there is a resistance there's a resistance Hallelujah what all happens before you come to church what all happens when you're trying to get to church I mean if if the baby if the baby's not wet in his pants you are and and if and if and if Mama's not mad you are and if they're saying or all of a sudden you get sick or you get a cough or you get a backache or you get it is resistance and the bride is say I've got to get into his presence that's the reason why Wednesday nights can be some wonderful nights amen you know why because there's extra resistance you're tired you're weary you're Hallelujah maybe I'm the only one that ever comes in here tired and cranky amen but I want to tell you when you come in his presence and you're feeling worn out Hallelujah Hallelujah the more you press the more you press the more the glory comes down it's what God's looking for somebody willing to get into his presence is it easy no it's not easy but I'm here to tell you there's a powerful River coming out of me and Satan I've been ordained and anointed to blow every damn up I've been ordained and anointed to rise above it I've got something powerful in me can you see man the secret believer Jairus now he had been a secret believer for a long time man he loved Jesus and he would always the one in the outskirts any man in the shadows hiding behind the trees are man as he's coming down the streets he would hide behind the little the little bushes and hear Jesus preaching and see the Miracles but you see Jesus was going to allow he was going to push the issue Jesus was going now remember Jesus is the one who's just told us you've got to be you've got to have opportunity you've got to be willing Jesus is saying if you want an answer for me you're going to have to press you're going to have to knock you're going to have to seek and here's an example here's Jarius but what happened God allowed he began to take the little the Downing out of the nest so to speak and when Jairus daughter got sick and all the doctors had done everything they could do Jarius was no longer a secret believer brother Branham says he picked up his hat he went out the door put his hat on and he'd come to Jesus and after a while he couldn't just sit on the outskirts he was in his presence but that wasn't good enough he had to get his attention before you know it he's no longer just sitting out there under a tree he's not out there looking with binoculars but now he's at the feet of Jesus now he's at the feet of Jesus and you know what happened Jesus says I'll come I'll come when you get his attention when you press through the the resistance when you're willing to push through it you're going to get an answer and I want to tell you the scripture says that he'll turn no man down praise the Lord but now watch watch whenever they was on his way he when he was on his way to their house that's when this woman with the issue of blood was coming through that Jesus is on his way to Jairus Jesus has just told this man I'm going with you and here comes the woman with the issue of blood and she's got to stop Jesus before he gets to Jairus house and what does he do he doesn't even she doesn't even stand in front of him Amen brother brother brother uh uh Harry gave us the a little bit of history behind her being unclean and and he she touched the Hem of His Garment but there was something about that press the scripture says she passed she pushed and when she'd done it she touched the Throne of God can you say man amen amen the scripture says and she came in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I made touch but his clothes I shall be whole and straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him he turned him about in the press in the crowd the throngs and he said who touched me and his disciples says Thou seeest the multitude thronging thee and sayeth thou who touched me I'm about to see her that had done the thing can you imagine as you're hearing brother Branham on the tapes and brother Branham stops he's he's here he's here with this with this man and he's Discerning and then all of a sudden he stops and he's and you don't hear it you don't see it but he's looking through the crown he's watching that Pillar of Fire and then he says you out there right right here behind this woman here and right it's somebody that intercepted the message to this one well glory to God I may be preaching to someone else right now and maybe you're thinking man this message ain't even for me yet but I'm here to tell you your faith can turn God your way come on now it's desire it's desire it's the willingness to press toward the prize can you say man now he said he looked about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in here came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and behold of thy plague there is a press that is required so so our church servant there's a press required in church services can I hear a big amen there's a press required in your prayer life there is a creek there is a press that is required in your dedication there is a press required in your gifts and callings there is a press that is required you don't get it easy we'll praise the Lord the word press is to move in a position or contact with something by exerting continuous physical Force it means to con it exert continuous Force to run swiftly in order to catch a person or thing to run after to press on figuratively of one who runs in a race runs swiftly to reach the goal to pursue in a hostile manner I say tonight I'm going I'm going to pursue the promises of God in a hostile manner amen I'm going to push past doubt to push past fear I'm going to push why the Press why the Press have you ever thought why the Press you boys ever wondered why you have to press you owners ever wonder because you're not in your natural environment the desire you have is an eternal desire from the soul that came from the image of God and you're living in a body that's wore out tired you're living in a body here that's affected by laodicey the soul is already found it's Eternal rest the soul is saying I believe but that old body can you say Amen there's where the desire comes from you're not in your your your natural environment you are fighting an uphill struggle the entire way you are literally fighting your carnal man your your carnal what is the carnal Spirit reasonings emotions imaginations mind battles well come on now well she done this to me well he said that to me well I've done this yesterday you are fighting you are fighting but I'm telling you you are an eternal being can you say Amen the man with the palsy remember that amen the the there he was his friends had heard of the miracle working power of Jesus and they took their friends to Jesus and they couldn't get in the house but they had already heard what Jesus had been doing can you say man amen they couldn't get near the windows or the doors so what did the Bible say they done the Bible says they took the roof off when you're when your goal is to get the attention of Jesus you're going to do what it takes and I can just only imagine they got the attention of Jesus as the roof is coming off piece by piece and he's up there and all the stuff has fallen down as he's trying to preach a sermon amen and and he's looking up at them with this gaping hole in the roof Hallelujah and they weren't just I listened they got his attention but then they took ropes and they dropped him right down in front of his pulpit Hallelujah they brought him right down in front hey when you can't do it you've got to do whatever it takes friends can you say man and they dropped him right in front of him and what did Jesus say Amen I'll just read the whole story to you real quickly Mark two and one and again they entered into Capernaum after some days it was it was noise that he was in a house and he and straightway many of them were many were gathered together in so much there was no room to receive them no not so much is about the door he preached the word unto them and they come unto him bringing this one sick of palsy which was born uh born a four amen and carried by four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press the multitudes they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let him let down the bed we're in the sick of palsy lay and when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of palsy son thy sins be forgiven thee I I you can I can I just tell you something here tonight struggle is a healthy part of your life a a man that don't have to struggle a girl that don't have to struggle if he's got all the money in the world why is it why is it uh uh that that that these guys that have uh you know when these Powerball things and and and and they've got like 20 million dollars or 20 billion dollars and and then before you know it within 10 years it's all gone they didn't work for it they didn't struggle for it it was given to them and so they're now living in yachts and this and that and the other things can you say Amen but a man that struggles for it amen he's he's not going to just blow it right come on now now we're we're in that Society where everyone wants everything for free and and but the struggle is a healthy part of your life y'all remember y'all remember my little butterfly story that the little butterfly was in that cocoon and and that cocoon was just wobbling around everywhere and and we could see the little head sticking out of the Cocoon and and and he's struggling and he's struggling in here and I thought my goodness so what we've done is we went and took the little cocoon down and we said amen we'll help you out so we go in there and we slit the Cocoon and out comes this wrinkled up butterfly and he just plops down and after a while when the wings begin to unfold a little bit amen but did you know that butterfly never did fly he never did fly it took the struggle of the Cocoon to build the muscle in his wings the little thing could never fly what I done what I done was took away the power to fly when I took away the resistance from his life and when you take away the reason why Christian why is things much worse now that I'm a Christian resistance pushes you closer to God resistance builds your faith muscles resistance gives you that Soul a determination Against All Odds can you say Amen man an eagle brother Branham says don't don't break the egg when that little egg is moving around and that little chicken is trying its best they man it's it's a pecking and a pecking and a pecking Hallelujah he says don't crack the egg the chicken won't be worth nothing it'll never be able to fly it'll never be able to do anything it's building its strength as it's pecking the egg and it just sets there in that little chicken you can you can see the little egg just it's a pecking oil pecking away that little beak has got that little that little grindy thing on it where where it just it's just pecking and pecking and pecking and pecking and pecking until one uh then a little crack comes and it just keeps on pecking and keeps on pecking amen and keeps on picking and what's it doing amen it is fixing to come out of the egg and that's what God has given us the desire is here and we are packing well glory to God what is the rapture all about we are finally going to bust through this egg of Flesh we're gonna finally bust through this egg of carnality we're gonna back oh glory to God I say tonight keep on pecking Little Eagles keep on pecking Little Eagles amen you've backed up brass you're not destined to stay in the egg you're destined for the sky you've got to press can you say man amen darkness comes before the day amen that real darkness hallelujah amen I'm real early in the mornings amen around four o'clock if you'd raise up hanging hanging out there there's that Morning Star and it's getting really dark amen just before the break of day it gets really dark brother Branham says we see the darkness Gathering now what is it it's the light pressing against the darkness one has to give way all the creeping things has been running through the night when the sun comes up they take shelter when the light shines night amen night and light cannot exist at the same time in the same building it's either dark or it's light and light is so much more powerful than darkness and so is Christ so much more powerful than all the evil that's in the world and we're taught the science as the light begins to come in it condenses the darkness and the Darkness gathers all of its holes as hosts together to fight against the light but the light prevails and comes on amen good morning good morning it's no wonder brother Branham could could preach Shalom good morning peace can you say Amen good morning peace unto you hallelujah amen oh yes some of you has had to fight so much resistance some of you just fought so much resistance and you fought and you fought in your fought it is Satan trying to keep you from your purpose it is Satan that is trying to keep you and Satan I'll just tell you right now he'd kill you if he can but he can't kill you he can't kill you because you're here for a purpose Hallelujah man he's here for a purpose somebody say I'm here for a purpose turn to your neighbor and say you're here for a purpose you're here for a purpose Satan can't destroy you I'm here for a purpose Satan can't keep me from my purpose I'm here it's already been destined it's already been spoken it's already been ordained I am here because God ordained me to be here and laodicea I am not here to see if I can make it I am here predestinated to make it my soul is predestinated I will reach my purpose I will reach my purpose Amen brother Branham says what God's word has to stand no man could touch Sarah because God had made a promise Sarah is the type of the Church the true church the Free Church the free woman with a free child type of the born-again church with a promise let them say whatever they want to say let them call it Holy Roller fanaticism they've tried to stop it since Pentecost they've never they'll never do it no sir just keep your hands off of it it's that's all God is going to take that and do something with it just assure as I'm standing here can I hear an amen amen Satan keep your hands off this bride we're going to make it well glory to God Lord I said glory to God amen you say well I received the Holy Ghost at Camp amen and now I'm feeling resistance I must not have got the Holy Ghost dear Lord no amen God has just equipped you to stand the resistance resistance is going to be there if you've got the Holy Ghost I just want to tell you you are sealed away and there is nothing the devil can do about it there's nothing sin can do about it you are seal until the day of your Redemption Hallelujah man there's another quote in here amen yeah he says he says what is it it's a sealed product he can't break that open and give something in there that's not right you just tell him to take your hands off I'm sealed oh my a sealed product yes sir you are purchased you hold that token over you unmovable faith in his promise and watch him go the effectual fervent forever righteous man of veileth much see and take that token that's what it is for amen brother Branham uh brother Timothy had sent me a sent a deal on on a Minister's chat and uh just before I came out and I I thought it was good so amen uh in brother Brands telling the story he said a young man there who was thrown out of a wreck just recently had a piece of angle iron went plumbed through his side sweeping through him and stuck out his his side like that and a dear Praying Mother and God spared him for some purpose and since she told me I thought this morning I met him I came in the hall and he shook my hand I said aren't you the boy he said yes sir and he said I've got a call to them I said call a call to the ministry amen God be merciful now my dear brethren it's the young man sitting there with a brown coat on may God grant that he'll become a flaming light while we're on at the junction of the road sign and the preach the gospel preached the Full Gospel preach all of the word don't compromise with nothing stay right there at the post of Duty and God Will Make A Great War here out of you now brother Branham is alluding to the man the boy Satan tried to kill him and he's saying God be merciful God make a preacher out of you and God you in other words Satan you've done the wrong thing there's something that is going to rise out of this boy can you say Amen amen tension is never to keep you out of contact with God tension and resistance is to push you to God amen now it brings how contingent what do you mean brother window the tension that is in your life that you that that that that that accumulates in your spirit man on the soul it causes you to get desperate before God brings about acknowledgment I fight this on my own can you say man if there was no pain or anxieties here on the earth you wouldn't desire eternal life if there was no pain and anxieties in your marriage well praise the Lord if there was no church problems that come along if there was no a friction on the job site we'd live in a Utopia we wouldn't have a desire to go home we wouldn't have a desire well praise the Lord but because there is sickness and because there is pain and because the devil you know as a sickness does come and death does come and turmoil does come and these things do come what does it do it creates desire to get out of this bust house it creates desire to get it right okay when I broke my back when they had put my put me back together they had pinched a nerve that was going down my leg and and would go down right down the inside of my leg and it was so painful and and so when I came out of the surgery um it I I I was I was almost bowed over crying and they would give the medication so when I got home you know within a a couple of you know I was there for two weeks took them ten and a half hours to put me all back together and then then it took and then I was in there for two weeks and I get out and and I'm saying man something's wrong so when they go back and they examine they say well when we put you back together we've hit a nerve somewhere and so they said what we're going to do is we're going to deaden that nerve and so I said well what does that mean I don't like any kind of death been associated with my body is well you like this it's going to kill the pain amen and so they they came up with this real long shot and and and they they gave it to me and they done it a couple times uh over the next couple days and um it killed the pain totally killed the pain now every now and then when I'm walking it'll I'll get a faint I'll get a faint hurt a faint something in that leg um and and it just goes and it goes up into my stomach but they said your brain you're still hurting you're still hurting but your brain don't know it we have deadened the nerve and the brain don't know it and so I came back after we was trying six months later I come back and I'm man I'm hurting with my back and I'm wanting to go to work and I said I want to talk to y'all and I said you know that thingy you've done to my leg won't you do that to my back I said this pain that I'm in and this that I'm going through would you I just deaden that and I said can you do it and they said oh yeah we could do we could do it but they said we're not going doing it and I said why they said because you would not feel any pain and I said that's why I'm here and they said if there was no pain there would be no resistance to tell you pull back right now here I they said but because of the pain then you crippled back to the truck and you go sit down because you're not supposed to be out on the job site but if we were to do this now you would feel like bionic man man would just get out there and work as hard as you've ever done and you would break your back and never know it oh right so the pet God does not take away the pain just because you get saved does not mean all of the stress all of the pain all of the turmoil is over but it gives you a reason to press on to that Immortal man brother random says speaking of tension I was praying about it this morning what what would you do if you didn't have the tension think of it tension is part of living that kind of encouraged me when I thought of that he says if you had no tension you'd be like a red dog you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be nothing you you could work on like a husband and wife maybe if she wants to do something and they're trying to work together especially Christians and they're the ones the other one once and then when when you come together you find that she wants what she wants done and she finds out and attention really brings it begins to bring you closer together somebody tells you well just think the little wife that went under a lot of attention when you wasn't so good or the husband went uh went under some tension when you wasn't so good and when it's all forgiven how you feel about him oh my you've got to have tension that's all so just think of feelings what if you didn't have any feelings no pain no nothing if there was no pain at all you'd not have no feelings at all and if you had no feeling then one of your senses would be gone everything's just right anyhow but so God just gives us Grace to stand up to it that's the thing if I just stand up with that Grace and stand there and say we know that when this life is over the great ones on the other side where we're looking to go when it's over here I've got something over there he says somebody tries some people try to introduce Christianity that you're free from worry no you're not that you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a Christian because you was a kind of a sloppy go happy go lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear from him it puts you on tensions put you on guard that's what makes you what you are someone say hallelujah so after all tension is a blessing it's just the way you're looking at it it's just the way you're looking at it see if you would look like on the other side see no matter how thin you slice it you've got two slides slices to it you see so you want to see both sides so tension oh my what's this tension if I could be born without tension well if I didn't have tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was the tension that drove me to Jesus Christ can you say Amen the Apostle Paul Iman it was detention it was the it was the Apostle Paul saying Lord and he asked the Lord three times delivered me from this Thorn In the Flesh deliver me from this take this tension away and God says God says amen my grace is sufficient for you for in your weakness is my strength made perfect are y'all with me amen now Hallelujah now brother Branham says he's speaking of him he says I consulted him one time when it used to bother me so bad it scared me he told me about eight or ten years ago it'll never scare you again and it never has did it no sir don't worry about it anymore I feel it I know it's there but I just go on because it don't scare me no more so thankful for that now this you know what you're hearing is the way I'm hearing it but when I hear it I think it was the spirit of anxiety trying to come on brother Brown I think it was the spirit of anxiety amen until he said that pressure and that stress would come on and and it would and it would get him get him worried but he says I I I I it'll never scare you it didn't say I would just take it away he says it'll never scare you again amen and he says and it never did no sir don't worry about it I just feel it I know it's there but I just go on because it don't scare me anymore so thankful for that now he could have said it won't be no more just as well as it won't scare you no more but it's his will that had happened so I just embrace it and say thank you Lord and walk that way well bless the Lord well bless the Lord so Satan comes in I'm not I'm not moving I'm not moving I'm pressing on are you hear me I am in other words I'm not going back I'm not setting still I am pressing onward to the price that God's ordained me for Jacob needed a change so he had to wrestle with God all night long Moses had to have a change so he had to come to that that fiery Bush amen there David had to press until he got amen until he fought through all the obstacles to the throne he had to do it I don't know what you're facing here tonight I'm fixing to close I don't know what you're facing tonight I don't know where what Satan's battling you with where wherever he's battling you it's time for you to look at that thing and say it's not going to scare me anymore it's not going to bother me anymore you're not taking me back anymore you have been ordained of God Amen to to build my muscles to take me in to give me greater strength to give me greater determination to come into His presence I'm going to reach his attention now now Hallelujah I've refused to just be a church member sitting on a church pew I'm going to get his attention I refuse to get up in the morning time and go through another normal day I'm going to get his attention before I leave I come on Church come on we want that we want his attention in our lives brother or Jesus his entire Ministry was full attention his entire life was full of tension Jesus was called an illegitimate child from birth Jesus was was done wrong all the way from birth can you say Amen Hallelujah but the psalmist says I I stretch forth my hands unto thee and my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land I am coming with purpose if the musicians would get ready to to come now what is my purpose my whole everything about me is to give glory and honor to God that's that's everything that I am that's that's all I I am here as the prophet said we have been put here to show the devil God allowed the whole situation to eat into Falls and for the devil to rise up his Eden so that God will show the power of his sons in the darkest of all ages and US defeat that enemy giving glory to God can you say Amen I I I I don't I I uh what's what's that song that that you can't stop my praise you can't hinder me what's he saying what's the song saying you ain't got enough Satan the pressures come God's allowed the fall the reason he's allowed to fall is to show the glory of the Soul and the Eternal God within me amen amen aren't you glad for that oh I don't have the Holy Ghost I man I'm just fighting to battle it might be a good sign you have it it might be a good sign that it's there can you say man but what you've got to do what I've got to do the believer of Psalms 57 and 7 my heart is fixed oh God my heart is fixed I will praise I sing I will sing and give praise come on Psalms 96 and 1. oh singing to the Lord a new song singing to the Lord all the Earth singing to the Lord and bless his name show forth his salvation or declare manifest his salvation exhibit his salvation from day to day declare his glory among the Heathen the Sinners and his wonders among all people for the Lord is great and greatly to be praised he has to be feared above all the gods for all the gods of the nations are Idols but the Lord made heavens honor and Majesty are before him and strengthen Beauty are in his Sanctuary give unto the Lord O ye kindreds of people give unto the Lord glory and strength given to the Lord Glory do unto his name bring an offering and come into His courts oh Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness and fear before him all the Earth can you say Amen I'm going to sing a new song I'm going to let the Iman the High Praise has come from this vessel I'm going to want to push past the resistance I I thank God that the that these Psalms were put in there because it gives you it it it it gives you the backside of the story it's wonderful to hear about David killing bears and lions and and goliaths and being the great king but God let us see struggles God let him pin that so that every one of you who is who are seeking after the heart of God every one of you who are after God's very own heart can understand it was the resistance that took him and made him great it's the resistance am I just repeating myself tonight it's that it's it's that part of you [Music] or if I could just get a better job or if I could just get a different disc or if I can just get a different that you're not going to get away from the spirit of laodicea the pressure is here well if I can get a different church if I if I'd make different friends well if I get a different You're Still Human and wherever you go your human goes [Music] amen [Music] but the but the but but the deal is there's got to be a press don't succumb to this flesh don't succumb to your your spirit man press and that's the reason it's it's a listen the reason why the church is powerless today is because the church don't pray today prayer is hard but as I was saying Sunday night catch this he don't come down from the heavens until you go up to the heavens brother Branham says when the bride takes her position Satan loses his position laughs and then the next verse they overcome the blood of a lamb and the witness of their mouth the word of their testimony can you say man Hallelujah so this means there's a Warfare it's an all-out Warfare it's an all-out Warfare but I just say press if y'all heard that yet tonight press press [Music] if you go let's go go read and any of the scholars you can just do you a little bit of a review online and just see all of the Great Men of the Bible or or of Christianity throughout all of these ages and every one of the Great Men whether it's whether it's whether it's a Wycliffe or whether it's David Livingston or uh uh uh all of these uh Dr Bernard all of these great men who influenced the world throughout the ages they all had something in Peculiar are you all ready for this they all said about the same thing and these guys lived hundreds of years apart [Music] that they found God more precious lots of them said between four o'clock and eight o'clock they would get up and start prayer at four o'clock until eight o'clock and then they would go to their activities many would do it from four o'clock to six o'clock but the but but but the strongest majority of them would do it around five or six o'clock in the morning they said there's and it's and it's exactly the way brother Branham says those early morning hours is when the devils are going to bed they've been working all night the Dew is coming down presence of the Lord he says there's something special about those early morning prayer now I'm not saying it's uh that's not a Doctrine I'm just saying when you look in the Diaries of these men they all had something peculiar it was easier to pray in those early morning hours [Music] the resistance as brother Brandon would say the Devils were going to bed they have made their Havoc throughout the night and I would say that some of my best prayers have been early of the morning I because you're more refreshed you haven't started your day your your mind's not all going yet right spending that special time with God there's a lot of vitals one prayer there's a lot of battles one in prayer I say as Elder Burris elder sister Burris would say I'm pressing on the upward way New Heights I'm gaining every day is that right we are not staying still we are not average laodiceans we are the Overcomers of laodicea we are those we're the brother Bradham would say you're a special class you're in a bright age you're in a situation you're still in laodicea but you're not part of the Judgment you're up higher and above it oh amen how do I press I need strength to press well the psalmist said if we're having a hard time in prayer what did he say I fasted and prayer returned unto my bosom so sometimes saying Lord fasting doesn't always have to be food it could be just putting that phone aside it could be it could be whatever's taking our time getting off that stinking Facebook getting off this and that getting along with God and say Lord let desire come back I won't desire to come back it's not the desires left it's not the desires left no no no no no no no you're an eternal being desire is there you may be in your little you may be in your little egg right now and God's just you're you're right on the verge of your miracle and you just need to keep on pecking now's not the time to be sitting inside the shell drinking lemonade saying the egg will crack when it wants to no you're ordained to crack the egg [Music] amen not just ordained but you're anointed for it I love him he's so
