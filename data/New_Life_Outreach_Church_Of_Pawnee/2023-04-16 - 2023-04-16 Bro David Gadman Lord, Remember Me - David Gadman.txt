divine order amen and and that that's just the way that's just how we got to go by his divine order and I appreciate it if it wasn't for us having a prophet in this our day we just we just do anything anyway but I'm glad that we had a prophet that sent some things in order for me and you in this hour that we're living in amen I'll tell you what it's good to see brother Duran with us to Amen Brother Martin senior tonight amen it's Amen it's good to see him in the house of God last several times we've been through here he's not been able to be with us but hey we just appreciate amen that God's still in the healing business didn't he amen he's still in the healing business and I appreciate that amen Saint Luke's gospel the 23rd chapter and the 39th verse you love the Lord tonight amen says in one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be the Christ save thyself in US but the other answering rebuked him saying that's not thou fear God seeing that thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing to miss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated tonight if I put a little thought to this uh tonight it'd just simply be Lord remember me Lord remember me and just just before we get started here I was thinking you know just we've been just traveling kind of evangelizing and you know I pray like brother like brother uh Wendell was saying this morning you know it just ain't getting up going somewhere you know because hey we could stay at home I told Brother Dale I said hey you you glad you're you you uh glad you're off the Evangelistic field he said yes sir he said I got tartar living out of suitcases I said that's what we've been doing for about a month and a half I told my wife I said man I should have took that church in Michigan you know I said but but just where you're calling I mean whatever you're called to do amen I'm glad my wife she likes to go with me amen keep me out of trouble amen so she sat back there she's looking amen but I but we're in there in there and I said I sure I want to be dedicated amen I want to be prayed up it's not a game with me amen and I thought you know and so as we was going and then it we got to you know and as we was going along we spoke there and for brother Jeremy and and Amarillo and then we went on there to uh Flagstaff and seemed like sister Joanne uh brother Dale's wife said My Brother David you just don't know what you said today or tonight so man we just we've been what brother Dale's been uh preaching on and everything then we got to a place and preached a Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning there at uh in Camp Verde and there's a sister that called my wife after we left there and she said you just don't know what Brother David preached on see we was praying and said I said my pastor said we was praying said we our church needed something needed to read I said I needed something she said you know how it is and it ain't that I'm not saved I said I'm saved and I love the Lord I love this message but it seemed like something she said I needed a breakthrough amen she said I was praying said I didn't know said I was praying said Lord help have my pastor invite somebody that'd help us amen said I didn't know it was you but I heard you was coming and it's like God this may be it he said Friday night is all right but it's that Saturday night she got her breakthrough I thought my God I didn't know nothing about that but I thank God that God's still in the saving business amen he's still in the Reviving business hallelujah hallelujah so Lord remember me let me read you a question and answer 1959 the prophet of God as we as we get into this all right he said therefore the question is that a man is saved I believe if he's looking towards Calvary we got to look towards Calvary we can't look anywhere else but we got to look toward Calvary amen because hey that that's the that's that's the proof uh Calvary and not only Calvary but he proved who he was on Easter morning amen because hey the scripture said Paul said in the word if he wasn't risen then our preaching is in vain all this is in vain but he proved what he was talking about on Easter morning thank God the Sun is up the sun is risen and me and you can go free amen so he said I believe he is if he's looking toward Calvary and dies in that estate certainly I believe you'll be saved I believe he'll go through though if he had if he had not the opportunity before but depends on you go back to the dying Thief at the cross but remember that was his first and last chance that was his first and last chance said you got one tonight don't wait till that time because it may not be that way with you he said that was he said he might saved he said I believe he is he said go through he'd be saved he said but you go back to that Thief at calm on the cross he said but remember that was his first and last chance oh he said oh my you got one tonight amen we all got tonight tonight could be your night amen this could be somebody's last service tonight amen and so I got to preach tonight like I'm a dying man preaching to a dying congregation Hallelujah let him hired God help us you know you don't sometimes I'm talking brother Kobe in the in the back there you know just some things I said sometimes you don't know what people go or our house to do things and or how to go about the leadership of the Lord until you've grown through some things and then you begin to look at situations a little bit different amen we're all human beings amen we all make mistakes there's only one that's unforgivable and that's blasphemy there's still hope as long as their breath help us Lord amen it's time that we look amen Beyond the Veil amen sometimes you won't say well that's just brother window that's just brother gadman or whatever but we got to look Beyond the Veil amen Hallelujah he said but remember that was his first and last chance you got one tonight he said don't wait till that time because it may not be that way with you it may not be that way with you hey I've known a lot of people that didn't know just snucked out just like that and they did not have an opportunity to repent and as the tree falls that's how it lays you say well I fished with a prophet I hunted with a prophet we need an experience with God not just fishing and hunting or whatever but we need an experience with God we need a Calvary in our lives first we need a Gethsemane not by will but thy will be done amen he said don't wait till that time because it may not be that way with you you might not have a deathbed confession he said I tell you they're all right but they're too much of a chance to take a chance on God help us then tonight say they're too much of a chance to take a chance on so why wouldn't I want to take a chance on something that's too much of a chance brother Marco to take a chance on God help me tonight then to be right with you Lord Hallelujah he said they're too much of a chance to take a chance out don't you wait for deathbed you you let this be your deathbed right here he said you let this oh God help me tonight Lord then let this be my deathbed right here let me confess amen all my sins Lord let me have the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just on the flesh not just on the spirit but down on the inside of the inside that it made me live what I'm preaching about he said you don't let that be he said you don't wait for it he said you let this be your bed right now that you die out die out now he says and be born again of the Holy Spirit God didn't let me die out now let me down to my thinking to my attitude Lord to my ideas Lord I ain't got a thought coming Lord It's All About You Lord It's Not About Me Lord let me come back to the Heart of Worship Lord let me come back to reality Lord Hallelujah amen he said you let it be your deathbed right now die out to the things of the world amen doubt everything that's not like him amen oh I like how he said it this morning amen I hope he wasn't getting on your pet peeve or anything but he said we want to watch our sports games and stuff till we come in here and then we would expect brother window to preach us happy amen come on brother gadman preach us happy you gotta come amen when the right atmosphere hey man you gotta come with the right attitude You Gotta Die out to those things Hallelujah amen he said die I'll be born again of the Holy Spirit again he says looking unto Jesus 1964. he said now we find out that many found Resurrection live when they look to Jesus what are you looking for tonight what'd you come here for tonight amen did he come say well brother David's preaching and well we know and or

need more of you amen not just a few songs not just a special but I need your presence in my life that Lord I need you in my life Lord on the inside of the inside something that's bubbling over so we found out that many found Resurrection in life so did Jairus amen you know God comes comes a time in your life where you have to make a decision hey man and that's what Jairus you remember he was a secret believer he didn't want nobody to know that he believed in the Lord Jesus amen but Jesus forced the issue on him oh sometimes he'll force the issue on me and you amen you believe this message

done for me and you commemoration of how that he took my sins and your sins and nailed them to a cross amen took your sins and my sins amen there wasn't only placed on him amen that other remember Two Goats one was a scapegoat one that sins were playing and they were he was that escape those oh where did he do placed it on him he would went to hell with your sins and my sins will mean you should have went amen I mean you should go we should die and go to the devil's hell but he took my place and he took your place then we won't have to go oh Jesus signed my pardon now I won't have to go amen take my place at Calvary so I won't have to go and we do those things in remembrance of what he done for me and you I'm so glad that he done that for me and you because by doing that I mean you can sit here tonight and praise Him brother Mike amen we can raise our hands to him and say God I love you I appreciate you lord I Love You Lord and I thank you for what you've done for me Lord God I appreciate it Lord that you took my sins so I wouldn't have to go to the devil's hell you took my place so I wouldn't have to go to an Old Rugged Cross Hallelujah what he done for me and he's remembering him what he done for us if you look back in Jesus's day to carry the cross meant death the Romans they made their convicted criminals carry their own cross while being ridiculed can you imagine here he was if he was living back then you were convicted of a crime you'd have to carry your own cross your own execution place got the key don't cry now you know it's something you know they had you know today they got many ways they they have a guillotine where they cut your head off they have the electric chair they have where they give you lethal injection shooting before a firing squad and they tell me that they firing squad especially if they got four guys only one of them has a real bullet but the real Marksman amen and they know what they're doing and how to just shoot just right and that guy's blindfolded and he's sitting there and he don't know which one it is there he is standing there before the firing squad they had all these kinds but you know what you don't wear Guillotine you sisters maybe sometimes maybe your husband gets you something and it's an emblem of a cross why wouldn't you wear a guillotine around your neck emblem of a good old teen of electric chair or whatever but there's something about the cross oh Hallelujah something about that old wooden cross amen can I just read you something real quick on a hill far away stood in Old Rugged Cross the emblem of suffering and shame and I love that old cross or the Dearest and best for a world of lost Sinners was slain on that Old Rugged Cross so despised by the world has a wondrous attraction for me so despised by the world but it has Amen brother Merle has a Wonder subtraction for me for the dear Lamb of God Amen to Bear it to dark Calvary amen took my sins your sins in The Old Rugged Cross staying with blood So Divine a wondrous Beauty I see for towards on that old cross Jesus suffered and died to Pardon and to sanctify me to The Old Rugged Cross I will ever be true it's shame and reproach I'll gladly bear then he'll call me someday to my home far away where his glory forever I'll share and of course is in our cherish That Old Rugged Cross till my trophies At Last I lay down and I'll cling to that Old Rugged Cross and I'll exchange it someday for a crown oh won't that be worth it all amen when these days will exchange it for a crown can you imagine can you cross maybe brother William would have done something awful they said you're guilty as as your guilty as charged and so they beat him have to put laid across on there and as he's caring people throwing all kinds of rotten fruit at him and everything so I look at him he deserves to die look at him look what he done look at this and this carry on Cross being ridiculed being spent upon that was my Lord the Bible says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for iniquities wounded for me and your transgress man you had transgressed the law we were guilty we couldn't pay for it no amount of money nothing that this world could pay what me and you owed but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities something that we know to do and not do it or something that we know we shouldn't do and keep on doing it and he was bruised for our iniquities can you imagine oh he took our place bruised from me and your iniquities wounded Romanian transgressions batapon I guess there's nothing so horrible that's a spit upon somebody I don't know if everybody anybody's ever been spit out or spit upon but I tell you what watered off what so unsanitary to be spit on brother Wendell handful hey had a handful a beard plucked out now you might not have had that but I've had my hair pulled and school before because I wouldn't keep quiet the teacher came up to me and grabbed my hair and pulled my head back and forth Every Which Way but Loose shut up gadman I told you to be quiet you do that today that's can't get by with that kind of stuff today I don't know if it was abuse or not but I set up and listen but can you imagine there he was bruise wounded spot a poem chastise said the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed the footnotes in my Scofield bible says it like this the literal rendering is horrible there's a movie what was about 2000 or the year 2000 or maybe Mel Mel Gibson I think it was the passion I don't know if anybody ever seen it but uh even that probably didn't depict a picture of what my Lord and your lord looked like spat upon beaten to them I said my footnotes there and I said it says little the little rendering is horrible so mark from the form of a man was his aspect that his appearance was not that of a son of man not human the effects of the brutalities described in Saint Matthew I mean death was death it was ultimated like this it occurred through a combination of constrained blood circulation organ failure failure and I officiation as the body strained under the own way under their own weight can you imagine constrained blood circulation organ failure and affixiation how did they would nail them to the cross and have they been their legs rather window and they would suffocate in their own fluid but it was in them times that they would raise up to kind of catch some breath so they could breathe and it was that time brother Kobe that he would raise up and try to get to go farther and then come back down then he'd raise up again and he said forgive them and he come back down and he'd raise up again said father forgive them for they know not what they do and come back down and he did that so me and you could sit here tonight Hallelujah they said if they that the criminals didn't die very soon it was they were it was hasten their death was hastened but they would hasten it by shattering their legs with an armed Club can you imagine but when it came to our Lord the Bible says not a bone and his body was broken Hallelujah can you imagine all the spit the blood the thorny crowns constrained circulation in the blood organ failure oh we ought to put it plain that it wasn't a pretty picture the brother Brandon said they shut the Quince with something wrapped around but he was put to an open shame can you imagine so that me and you could sit here tonight and raise our hands and sing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see thank you Lord Hallelujah amen Hallelujah said they would hasten it by shutting their legs with an orange club which prevented them from supporting the body's weight and made inhalation more difficult accelerating both affixiation and shock that's awful amen the psalmist David said it like this under the anointing he said my bones are out of joint his hands were out of joint his arms were out of joint his shoulders were out of joint this pelvis was out of joint and there was no action of heart the action of the heart was affected amen and David said on the anointing my bones are out of joint and I poured out like water my heart is like Wax and it's melted in the midst of my bowels foreign he was suffered streamed exhaustion an extreme thirst but he did it that we can go free Hallelujah no wonder that song I must tell Jesus all of my trials Amen brother window can't handle all my trials you can't handle all my I can't handle our ears but I know a man who can tonight and his name is Jesus Hallelujah I can't take a heart that's broken and make it over again I can't take amen a lame man and make him walk again but I know a man who can Hallelujah some call him savior amen but I call him Jesus for he's my dearest friend hallelujah thank you I must tell Jesus all my trials lord I can't handle my burdens alone that's why I need you Lord I can't handle the loan Lord I tried and I just get messed up lord I can't handle my burdens alone oh God help us tonight amen Lord would you remember me tonight I can't handle my burdens Lord I can't handle my trials they're too hard Lord I thought I could Lord but I just made a mess out of it it just got me deeper and deeper in trouble Lord would you help me Lord would you remember me Lord in my distress he kindly will help me Amen in my distress he's a he's the greatest helper that I know of he's a present help in the time of trouble Amen in my distress he kindly would help me all my troubles he'll bring them quickly to an end he's a kind compassionate friend Hallelujah each one let's take a closer than a brother Hallelujah your family may leave you your friends may leave you your your companions may leave you even job's wife said why don't you curse God and die but he's one that sticker closer than a brother Hallelujah he'll never leave me nor forsake me remember that dream that God had when he got there looked back over his life seemed like in all the smooth places the Lord was right beside him then when it got rough he said he didn't see no Footprints beside him he said Lord did you leave me did you forsake me he said no my son that's when I picked you up in my arms and carried you oh hallelujah how many times me and you had to be carried amen me and you had to be carried along oh he's a kind compassionate friend tonight hallelujah amen he'll bring all my troubles quickly to the end he will deliver amen he will deliver make my troubles quickly to the end the world to evil allures me all around us it's worse now than it ever was then there's more things to get your young people's mind off the Lord than anything else back in our day it was hard but it ain't hard as like as is now so many spirits why because the lead has come off of hell and demon powers are streaming in every direction that's why we need to come to the house of God that's why we need one another that's why we need prayer and fellowship with one another brother Brown told us one I think it is going to be on the camp told this one said there was a I guess maybe like a youth deal today this young girl is going to put some sheets on the bed make the bed she said call that young lady back says he's seen that lied over the man said it like this and I got it the quote before me I can pull it up if you want me to it might not be perbatim but it be said that she had made a profession when she was 12 but she wasn't a Christian made a profession when she was 12 years old got baptized but you see the reason I say she wasn't a Christian because she never did attend church I thought my Lord then how important it is to come to the house of God amen never did attend church well I live stream amen hey that might be all right if you're sick or whatever amen the devil's made it good for us that we can stay home in our pajamas and drink our hot chocolate amen they need our popcorn but there's nothing like coming to a live service and entering an end with fellowship and worshiping Amen in the presence of almighty God Hallelujah amen Hallelujah the world to evil allures me my heart is tempted to sin now I must tell Jesus he'll help me over the world amen in Matthew's account it tells about the chief priests and the scribes and the elders mocked him Mark the self the suffering savior saying he trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will help him for he said I am the son of God the Bible also said there in Saint Matthew's account the thieves also which were crucified amen with him cast the same in their teeth you know there's always there's two kinds of responses that you usually get and the two kinds is number one the first Thief is we all can be like this we can we can rail against God me and you can and say hey if you are such a great and powerful and and loving God while I'm in Wyoming why I'm in this hellish mess we can be like that and then the second one his attitude was a whole lot different than that first one he said hey we can another he acknowledged that he was a sinner I mean you can do that and and we don't desire any good thing hey the Bible said we read it that he was that hey we we receive Justice for our dues we received the new Justice for our Deeds this guy he ain't done nothing to miss and he cried out for mercy and said help me cried out for mercy and help in the time of desperation see the world is full of the first kind who think that God owes them everything put your finger in a bucket of water the prophet of God said take your finger out find out where you put it he said that's how much God don't need you but you sure do need him amen the world they're further who thinks of the god oh but only a few that are of the second kind is a God I know I deserve what I get Lord but Lord just have mercy you remember there was two guys that went to the temple to pray a Pharisee and Republican the Pharisee said Lord he held his head high said how fast twice the week I've done all these things I probably ties of all of them all I own I thank you Lord that I ain't like this one this one and I thank you that I ain't like that Republican and that Publican didn't even raise his head just kept his head bowed and smoked his breasts and said God be merciful to me a sinner oh God I don't deserve nothing Lord I deserve to die I know would you be merciful to me tonight nor would you remember me see both are suffering the pain of crucifixion fiction both the guilty of crimes receiving the new reward of their deeds both see the sign over Jesus's head King of the Jews they hear the words from his mouth father forgive them both of them want to be desperately saved from death and most of us have these things in common with the two thieves let's see the difference between the two the first one ain't she the Christ well that's what it says and we heard people say these things ain't you the Christ ain't you doing all these things save yourself and us too yeah see it's a picture a spiritual destitute a worldly man a matter of total indifference to him that is suffering the new reward of his deeds right and wrong praise and blame good and bad or of no interest to him his objective is to save his Earthly skin that's all he wants to do he knows he got in trouble he knows he's done wrong but all he wanted to do is save his Earthly skin here Lord hey I don't care right and wrong good and bad blame whoever praise whoever good and bad that's no interest to me I just want to come down off this cross he he see he he might he might even be he might even believe Jesus was the Messiah I don't know he he might even believe the message was right just like me and you we believe that he is Lord tonight amen he is Lord he is Lord he has risen from the dead and he is Lord we believe this message is right come on if we got any sense of balance we know this message is right but it's just a matter of convenience to him oh God don't let this message just become a matter of convenience to us amen where Hey listen I'm backsliding I better put on a tape and press play so I can become under the token they ain't the token what is the token the very Life of Christ on this way in a believer's life amen this guy it's just a matter of convenience to him he'll take anybody as a king who can get him off the cross Jesus all he is to him is just another Patsy to serve his own worldly purposes the second one he suffers and he and the suffering this first one the suffering interrupts his goals and pleasures so why not try God and maybe he can get me out of trouble he can get me out of this financial mess out of this sickness out this crummy marriage but he's got no Spirit of Brokenness he's got no guilt no Penance or humility he only sees Jesus as a possible power to get him off the cross he don't see him as a king to be followed never entered his mind to say he was sorry and he should change but the second one he is not suckered in by the Other Fellers uh uh railing oh God help us not to get well and uh caught up in the other people's uh whatever they're going through however that and they may say this and that let us not get caught up in that amen but we have to stand our ground and not be sucked in by the people other brothers and sisters amen all around us why what doesn't he do you not he even tells another don't you fear God don't you know what hey we deserve to die we did this and we've done all this and we deserve to die amen we deserve all this we need to deserve to die amen we deserve all this amen and he's looking and I imagine that Thief brother Michael if he could tell us testimony he'd tell us things didn't make us our hair stand up on the back of the head what he's seen he didn't mix in all sorts of society he had all things amen he he got caught up with a crowd amen the so-called crowd so-called what he thought was his friends he got caught up in that all kinds of societies amen but he began to look at something brother Wendell and he began to look at the Lord's Behavior I've never seen a man carry a cross with such behavior and as he thought why who is this guy he began to think I've never seen anybody on the way to their crucifixion on the way I've never seen I've seen all kinds of people but I've never seen one like this guy that bore a cross like this before this warming fashion he probably thought who is this Meek and Majestic person any seen people Weeping at the foot of the cross they probably thought itself he's seen all that he thought about would there be anyone that would weep for me he's seen all them people weeping either of God whether it be anybody that would weep for me oh my who could this be pilate wrote the king of the Jews they probably thought is this who he is is this him is who it really is they probably they they probably heard it in the from the lip of his enemies because it was there was Crisis enemies all around uh mocking him and making fun of him said hey you'd say you're the king come off the cross hey just like today you know the internet's good it got all kinds of bad things against this message but it gets a lot of people checking into it so hey could it really be all that bad you take a you take a tree that's got a lot of rocks at the bottom of it you know what that means that means there's a lot of good fruit in that tree where people are taking rocks and trying to knock that fruit out hallelujah amen oh man he break in to look at it he said is this who he really is this who he is is this the one this him there he was there was no one else around all his disciples had forsaken him Christ that is John might have lingered in the distance just a little ways off there's some women that stood maybe stood far off Judas had just sold them out Peter had denied him and he said Lord would you remember me but you remember me Lord no one had surrounded him this thief there was everybody around Jesus mocking him despising him weeping like I said all the disciples had forsaken John might have lingered of this and he just said Lord don't you remember me no one had surrounded him there's people all around us tonight that believe amen and they're urging me and you to keep pressing on keep pressing the battle we as older folks are telling you young people to keep pressing don't give up don't know the talent keep pressing on Hallelujah oh there's people all around us that love us and urges his own and their testimony oh it should make us want to fall in love with Christ that much more their testimony amen oh you take a brother Duran There Brother Martin senior he become probably can tell us testimonies of what he's seen during the course of his life as him a minister of the Gospel amen and sell how you tell your young people keep pressing keep pressing I remember this one guy he was dying he was dying amen and he had loved the Lord he loved this message he called all his sons in he said Sons this is where it pays off right here amen this is where the reward is right here when it comes it's time Hallelujah hey man he said keep pressing keep believing keep loving him Hallelujah Hallelujah he had no one that Thief didn't have no one no one preached to him there was no Evangelistic message at the foot of the cross there was no special meeting going on there was no special prayer request for him nobody read up said hey we got a special prayer request there's a thief that's fixing to die and he wants you to remember him in prayer there was no special request an Evangelistic message no special prayer requests people in here today each and every one of you in here today you've heard the gospel probably from your childhood you've been admonished you've been invited you've been warned this picture of the thief it does not Comfort us but what it should do it should rebuke us why do you wait why you still not believe are you ever going to believe in the testimony of divine love you I can see him say Lord remember me and Jesus says today you'll be with me in Paradise and brother Duran I can see him when he says Lord remember me and Jesus says today you'll be with me in Paradise then brother Joe all of a sudden he bows his head that Thief and he's dead somebody said you know what dying is like when some of us was real little maybe you visit your grandmother and y'all would stand over there for a long time and you got real sleepy and you fell asleep on the couch and your mom and dad came and picked you up took you out to the car and when you woke up was in your bed one of these days we're going to wake up we're going to fall asleep in him we're going to wake up yeah yeah you ever had ever been a year you ever been in a nightmare and you wake up you say thank God that wasn't real this is just a nightmare we're in amen and one of these days we're going to wake up say praise God this wasn't real after all Hallelujah Hallelujah he bows his head and he dies then all of a sudden brother Durant he opens up his eyes and Jesus says there's my buddy fits his arm away and said welcome home my son he looks around there's Ezekiel there's Daniel there's Elijah oh hallelujah oh just to thank he can say we I made it I made it oh brother window one of these days amen when we get over there and you may I don't know Brothers said he told Paul said yeah Paul had to begin with his group I don't know how the bride's just a few but brother Wendy would it be somewhere over there sitting around that table thousands of miles long and you punched me and said Brother David we made it we made it we made it I can say brother Kobe we made it and then it was worth all the problems all the battles all everything we ever went through we made it we made it Hallelujah can I read you desperation 1960 three brother Brown says like this and on the Lamb's Book of Life I want my name wrote I want him to remember me when the role is called he said and it throws me into desperation that is like Paul said after I preached the gospel shall be a stowaway so I'll be cast off he said it could happen think about it what was brother Wendell talking about being dedicated that's ministers hey man all that he said it could happen Paul said I've got to bring this body under subjection to what the word he was preaching because that very word that he would preach would meet him at the day of judgment amen remember I said it could happen he said so it throws me into a desperate stage desperations to think after all these years of preaching what could I could I I a place come where I could fail him what's the next move what must I do next and it throws me into a nervous stage that what can I do it throws me to the mountains into the valleys and it's hard because when I'm with the people I got to be all things to all men that I might win some to Christ yet with a token always before me I wrote it like this Lord remember me when I'm down and out Lord remember me when I'm going through hell and high water Lord remember me when Tears are Falling Down Lord remember me when there's no friends around Lord remember me when I have to cross Jordan I don't want to Cross Jordan Alone again message of Grace Reverend says it like this oh I like this he can save a Wretch like Me and he did what is it Grace William Branham a drunkard son that don't make any difference the grace of God saved me me a woman's daughter that was no good it don't make any difference hallelujah oh brother when I'm glad he said that don't make no difference who you are tonight he said the grace of God saved you it's Sovereign has to ask nobody nothing and then brother Graham says amen I'm so glad of that he says hallelujah you know what all brother Durant you don't have to ask nobody nothing can I say brother window can I say brother Gad no it don't have to ask no I'm just going to do it amen I'm just going to do it the Bible says over there not many wives not many noble not many mighty were called but every now and then he said you're mighty Ah that's all right come on follow me you're noble come on that's all right father oh hallelujah amen he said not very he said he can take the violent Sinner and make him white as snow he don't have to ask anybody about it oh it can do it because it's sovereign he said listen closely now that was proved at the cross when there was a violence Thief he deserved to die God had never came across his mind he never thought nothing of it there on the cross went through those bloody lips in between the groans that came a sound Lord be merciful to me and there came another one back through blood tears Agony Grace took a hold and said today shalt thou be with me in Paradise Grace did that how could that Thief help himself no more than Adam and Eve could help himself no more than he could help herself no more than you can help yourself no more than I could help myself when no more that we could jerk ourselves up the milky white way with her bootstraps we couldn't do it but the grace of God can do something about it and it does it the grace of God the sovereignty of the grace of God come to that dying Thief today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise oh think of it he said that's wonderful true amen again he says in time evangelism our heavenly father he says you see the hands you know what was behind them now they're trophies of this meeting they're trophies of the message you said all that the father has given me will come to me and no man can come except my father draws him first Hallelujah I don't know if you're saying here but we sing a song Back Home Draw Me Lord draw me and I'll come running after you oh it's he said no man can come to me except the father draws him oh brother Joe sister Stephanie think about the drawing power of almighty God Amen when you thought my not me not and somebody people thought not them but all God said yes my grace is Sovereign yes them I want them hallelujah oh brother Kobe amen when you want to give up and quit amen the grace of God is Sovereign he said no you can't quit Hallelujah Hallelujah amen trophies of his grace he said all the father has given me will come to me and no man can come to me except my father draws him first and you spoke to this people and they were sitting there and according to science they could not their hands are supposed to stay down because there's gravitation holds them down but they've broken defied the laws of science they got a spirit in them that raised their hand that's contrary to science because the spirit in there can break science and they raise their hand because they were spirit of God around them that said you need Christ and they raised up their hands Remember Me O Lord hallelujah oh brother Barry I'm glad that one day I defied science and I'm still Divine Science brother window because I need him every day amen not just on Sunday morning Sunday night not just on when but I need them every day brother William and that's why I'm saying Lord would you remember me Lord amen would you remember me Lord Jesus Hallelujah has a dying thief on the cross said remember me when thou cometh into the kingdom and what did you say to him today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise last one Sumerian Church age Church age book and here he is walking in the midst of those who he has redeemed he said here he is walking in the midst of those who have he has redeemed even in it even his church and what were those who were redeemed we're not many like Paul murders and corrupters many of us was like that he said well you was raised in the message that don't make any difference I still had to be born again murderers corrupters we're not many like the dying Thief robbers and Men killers oh trophies of his grace all brought back from the dead all made alive in Christ Jesus the Lord trophies is Grace you love him maybe that same song it's All About You Lord is Ever playing that softly can I just read you something real quick little story you can probably heard it before I'll just read it to you before we turn it back to brother window listen to this he said after 40 Years of faithful service to the Lord as a missionary to Africa Henry Morrison and his wife were returning to New York as a ship near the dock Henry said to his wife look at that crowd they haven't forgotten about us however unknown to Henry the ship also carried president Teddy Roosevelt returning from a big game hunt trip in Africa Roosevelt stepped out from the boat with great Fanfare as people were cheering flags were waving bands were playing and reporters waiting for his comment Henry and his wife solely walked away unnoticed they held a cab which took them to the one bedroom apartment which had been provided by the mission board over the next few weeks Henry tried but failed to put the incident behind him he was sinking deeper into depression when one evening he said to his wife this is all wrong this man comes back from a hunt trip and everybody throws a big party we give our lives to in faithful service to God for all these many years but no one seems to care his wife costed him that he should not feel this way Henry plot I know you're right but I just can't help it it just isn't right that's why I said then said Henry you know God doesn't mind if we honestly question him you need to tell this to the Lord and get this settled now you'll be no you you'll be useless in his ministry until you do any more Morrison then went to his bedroom got down on his knees and he began to pour out his heart to the Lord Lord you know our situation and what's troubling me we gladly served you Faithfully for years without complaining but now God I just can't get this incident out of my mind after about 10 minutes of favorite prayer Henry return to the living room with a peaceful look on his face his wife said it looks like you resolved the matter what happened Henry replied the Lord settled it for me I told him how bitter I was that the president received a tremendous homecoming but no one even met us as we returned home when I finished it seemed as though the Lord put his hand on my shoulder and simply say but Henry you're not home yet said it's not yet time to congratulate ourselves neither is it time for us to tell ourselves that we have done enough Heaven is a home and as long as we're not yet there we have to keep pressing on God help us Lord remember me that's by our heads Heavenly Father Lord you've been so good to us father and I'm standing
