[0:01] You were not a god created
[0:06] by human hands.
[0:09] You are not a god dependent
[0:14] on any mortal man. You are not a god in

[32:15] our savior.

[32:30] the rain.

[34:37] Kings
[34:40] and kingdoms,
[34:43] they will all
[34:46] pass away.
[34:48] But there's something
[34:50] [Music]
[34:52] about
[34:55] that name.
[35:01] What a wonderful Jesus.
[35:03] [Music]
[35:06] What a wonderful God. We love you, Lord.

[36:10] wonderful presence that has settled over
[36:14] the people

[36:20] your feet and you open your words of
[36:22] life to us

[37:19] And Lord, we love you in Jesus name.
[37:24] Amen. And amen.
[37:26] [Music]
[37:28] Something about that wonderful name of
[37:31] Jesus.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Hell still trembles at that name.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. There's been a lot of
[37:41] reinvention of Christianity,
[37:44] &gt;&gt; but the original is still the best.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; The founder is still omnipotent,
[37:52] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:55] He don't have to be improved upon.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; He don't have to be. He is all in all.
[38:01] He's our Lord. He's our Savior.
[38:05] And we love him this morning.
[38:08] Bless the name of Jesus. Bless the name
[38:11] of Jesus.
[38:13] Well, good morning. It's good to to be
[38:16] here in the house of the Lord. Good to
[38:17] see you here today.
[38:20] And uh we just pray that that the Lord
[38:23] will bless you abundantly. It's good to
[38:25] see everyone here today and u our good
[38:29] to see our all of our friends from
[38:31] Henrietta here this morning and God
[38:34] bless y'all.
[38:39] Amen. Just just so good to to see
[38:42] everyone here and um we just know that
[38:45] God and I did you enjoy brother Caleb's
[38:48] song? I like that song
[38:51] and uh
[38:54] I've been singing that song for the last
[38:57] three or four days and uh and so I uh I
[39:02] I was really thinking this morning it'd
[39:03] be nice I think I think uh Caleb sung on
[39:07] Wednesday night too but I was thinking
[39:08] man it'd be nice if if uh if he had sing
[39:11] that song again this morning and brother
[39:13] Merl had him sing it. Praise the Lord.
[39:15] So that's that's just wonderful. Amen.
[39:18] Nothing greater than you. Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Let's let's look here in in H Psalms 1
[39:26] and one.
[39:28] And um
[39:30] it sure is good to have um our friend
[39:34] there with with brother Joe. And um we
[39:39] just uh hope that he feels right at home
[39:42] and and that the Lord blesses him this
[39:45] morning. and um uh brother Nathaniel and
[39:50] Sister Katrina, they've they've had it
[39:52] rough here lately. It's good good to see
[39:55] them this morning. And um uh tell you
[40:00] what
[40:02] we uh you know when you when that
[40:04] sickness goes around, you just looking
[40:06] forward every day to that new body.
[40:08] Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; And um and so let's look here in the
[40:13] book of Psalms 1 and1. Blessed
[40:16] is the man that walks not in the counsel
[40:20] of the ungodly,
[40:22] nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor
[40:24] siteth in the seat of the scornful,
[40:27] but his delight is in the law of the
[40:30] Lord, and in his law does he meditate
[40:33] day and night.
[40:35] He shall be like a tree planted by the
[40:38] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[40:41] fruit in his season.
[40:44] His leaf also shall not wither, and
[40:46] whatsoever he does shall prosper.
[40:50] The ungodly are not so, but are like the
[40:53] chaff which the wind drives away.
[40:57] Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand
[41:00] in the judgment, nor sinners in the
[41:02] congregation of the righteous.
[41:06] For the Lord knoweth the way of the
[41:09] righteous, but the way of the ungodly
[41:13] shall perish.
[41:15] And I I want to uh take my thought out
[41:19] of that third verse this morning.
[41:22] He shall bring forth his fruit in his
[41:25] season.
[41:27] And the prophet would tell us that it
[41:32] was he, the believer, will bring forth
[41:35] God's fruit in the prophets's season.
[41:40] And we're still wanting to deal a little
[41:41] bit this morning on the anointing. Sort
[41:44] of continue from last week. And father,
[41:47] we just want to thank you today
[41:50] for your words of life. And we're just
[41:53] asking Lord that you would anoint both
[41:55] speaker and hearer in the name of the
[41:58] Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say
[42:00] amen?
[42:02] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[42:04] seated here this morning.
[42:07] The anointing,
[42:09] it's not a feeling. It's not an emotion.
[42:14] But the anointing is the presence of God
[42:18] on the earth. Amen.
[42:22] declaring or doing doing his work
[42:27] in different seasons of of life. we went
[42:30] through last week and how that the first
[42:35] uh
[42:37] mention of anointing would be there when
[42:42] Jacob had had the dream of the angels
[42:45] ascending and descending and and um and
[42:50] and you know God confirming the covenant
[42:53] with him and he got up and took the
[42:57] stone that he was
[42:59] uh that he slept on and he he he erected
[43:03] up as a pillar and and he anointed it.
[43:06] He smeared oil upon it. He called the
[43:09] place Bethl, the house of God.
[43:14] And um we find that the anointing, Amen.
[43:18] Uh we find later on in the tabernacle
[43:21] that that God would uh would have Moses
[43:26] to take some spices and put it in the
[43:29] oil and it would be the anointing oil.
[43:33] And this oil would be used to uh uh
[43:38] sanctify or to set apart the tabernacle.
[43:42] It would set apart the altar. It would
[43:44] be set apart um for the for the service
[43:49] of the Lord and it would never be used
[43:51] for anything else. It was to be
[43:54] consecrated. It was oil that was that
[43:57] was poured on or smeared on. Amen.
[44:01] Rubbed onto and it would be the place
[44:05] that God would come. Amen. And he would
[44:09] meet with man. And we find that the
[44:12] anointing that the great pillar of fire
[44:15] would come down upon that tabernacle and
[44:19] would sanction what God Amen. what they
[44:23] had set apart.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; And so God would use the prophet Moses.
[44:29] Amen. to anoint and would and would set
[44:33] it in order for the anointing or the
[44:36] presence of God, the Messiah of God, the
[44:40] logos of God to come down and dwell with
[44:44] God's people.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the tabernacle was set aside
[44:50] for sacred service.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So then God would have that
[44:56] anointing oil with those spices and they
[44:59] would anoint the garments of of Aaron
[45:02] and his sons.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they would anoint even the
[45:07] right earlobe, the right thumb, the
[45:09] right toe of the priest that they could
[45:13] walk in to that anointed uh sacred
[45:18] tabernacle and God would come down, the
[45:22] great God, creator of all heaven and
[45:26] earth would come down to visit with his
[45:30] people
[45:31] &gt;&gt; because it was set aside.
[45:33] WE SO THEN WE FIND AS we as we went on
[45:37] last week and how that Amen. God would
[45:40] raise up a prophet to take a the the a
[45:44] horn of oil and he would he would go to
[45:49] uh the the house of Jesse and the house
[45:52] of Jesse. Amen. He would find a man
[45:55] there that he would anoint to be king.
[45:59] And and we understand that uh the ALL OF
[46:02] THE SONS of Jesse came out one by one
[46:06] and the PROPHET OF GOD SAMUEL would look
[46:09] and say surely this is the man.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Surely oh he's strong. He's intelligent.
[46:16] He's good-looking. And God would say
[46:19] this is not the one that I have had in
[46:22] my mind. YOU SEE GOD'S GOT A particular
[46:25] plan for every one of us.
[46:27] God's got an anointing AND HE'S NOT
[46:29] GOING TO PUT HIS anointing upon just
[46:32] upon anyone. Amen. The And and as I said
[46:36] last week, Amen. He could have poured
[46:38] the anointing oil on all on all the sons
[46:41] of Jesse, but that would have not been
[46:44] the one that God anointed because it was
[46:46] not the predestinated uh uh seed of God
[46:50] for the throne.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; But when he looked around and he said,
[46:53] "Do you not have any more?" And he says,
[46:55] "Well, yeah, I've got a boy down in in
[46:58] the He's a shepherd. He just tends the
[47:00] sheep." Amen. And he's the youngest, and
[47:03] you know, he's just uh and he says, "Oh,
[47:06] DON'T DON'T LET FATHER SAY SO. Just
[47:08] bring him up here." And and when he
[47:10] come, the spirit of the Lord come upon
[47:13] the prophet and says, "This is the man
[47:16] that you are to anoint for he will be my
[47:20] king over Israel."
[47:23] Oh, aren't you glad that God's got a
[47:25] prophet that knows the voice of God? AND
[47:29] THE VOICE of God, Amen, told him to
[47:32] anoint a particular man for that was the
[47:36] one that God had for ordained.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD'S GOT A GOD'S GOT A PLAN.
[47:43] GOD'S GOT A PEOPLE TODAY, and God will
[47:45] never change his plan.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; God will produce. He will RAISE UP A
[47:52] PROPHET messenger in the season.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WILL ANOINT THAT MAN TO COME
[47:59] TO ANOINT his church
[48:01] &gt;&gt; for their particular season.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it took a it took another
[48:07] prophet that would rise up in in the day
[48:11] of of of Jesus. Amen. John the Baptist
[48:15] would say, "This is the lamb." Yeah.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the IT WAS THE PROPHET THAT
[48:23] STOOD THERE. AMEN. At the uh there at
[48:26] Jordan River SAYING, "THIS IS GOD'S
[48:30] MESSIAH here on the earth. God has
[48:34] anointed him."
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus would stand in the temple and he
[48:38] would take the book written there in
[48:41] Isaiah 61 and he and he found the place
[48:44] where it was said, "Amen. And the spirit
[48:47] of the Lord God is upon me. And he hath
[48:49] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[48:53] poor. Amen. And to open the blind eyes
[48:56] and and to preach deliverance to the
[48:59] captives. And and HE WOULD GO THROUGH
[49:01] THESE things here. Amen. THEN HE WOULD
[49:04] CLOSE THE SCRIPTURE UP AND HE WOULD SAY,
[49:07] "This day is this scripture fulfilled."
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Now it was Amen. IT IS IT HAS GONE FROM
[49:14] AN OIL. IT HAS GONE FROM JUST anointing
[49:17] a a A A PILLAR, AMEN, TO ANOINTING uh
[49:21] some spices and oil on down AND ON DOWN
[49:26] UNTIL NOW IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THERE IS
[49:29] A PROPHET THAT IS GOING TO ANOINT THE
[49:33] MESSIAH WITH HIS WORDS.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE IS GOING TO ANOINT. AND THIS IS
[49:39] ALL SCRIPTURAL BECAUSE THE SCRIPTURE
[49:41] SAYS THAT HIS DOCTRINE SHALL FALL LIKE
[49:45] RAIN. ANOTHER PLACE THE ANOINTING SHALL
[49:49] COME as rain. Can you SAY AMEN? SO THE
[49:53] PROPHET'S WORDS were anointing THE
[49:57] MESSIAH FOR THAT DAY.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to the lamb of God. THERE HAD
[50:04] TO BE A FORERUNNER TO THAT WORD. There
[50:08] had to be God will always raise up a
[50:11] prophet TO POINT TO THE word for that
[50:14] hour. God has always done it. BROTHER
[50:16] BRANDHAM WOULD talk in this scripture.
[50:18] Amen. Using the scripture here in Psalms
[50:20] that we had read, he says, "Now he shall
[50:23] bring forth his fruit in his season."
[50:26] Watch each his personal pronoun there.
[50:30] It's his fruit, God's fruit in the
[50:33] season. THE PROPHET IS BRINGING IT.
[50:36] It'll it'll be in the prophet's season.
[50:38] God's fruit in God's time by the
[50:42] prophet's season. See, he shall bring
[50:45] forth his fruit in his season. He see if
[50:48] there isn't uh see if there isn't two
[50:51] hises there. Amen. Bring forth his God's
[50:54] fruit. See, in the season that the
[50:57] messenger is ordained to come, HE'LL
[51:00] BRING FORTH THOSE. NOW REMEMBER that the
[51:03] messenger that brings the fruit of God
[51:06] will BRING IT IN GOD'S SEASON in the
[51:09] season of the bringer. He will bring
[51:11] forth his fruit. It cannot wither. Why?
[51:14] He's got predestinated fruit in there.
[51:16] It can't be destroyed. Well, can you say
[51:19] amen?
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Because it's predestinated. Psalms 5 or
[51:23] or Ephesians uh 1 and5. Amen. It says
[51:27] sitting together in heavenly places in
[51:29] Christ Jesus. What happened? HE SAID,
[51:31] "GOD BY HIS fornowledge predestinated us
[51:35] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[51:37] Christ." GOD BY HIS FORNOWLEDGE
[51:40] PREDESTINATED EVERYTHING THAT WOULD
[51:42] HAPPEN right down along the road. By his
[51:45] fornowledge, he foresaw it. And
[51:47] therefore, from the beginning, he could
[51:49] tell the end. Therefore, IT WAS
[51:52] PREDESTINATED FRUIT, the root of this
[51:55] tree. AND THIS TREE CANNOT wither
[51:59] because it was holding predestinated
[52:02] fruit. Well, can you say amen?
[52:05] &gt;&gt; NOW, HE TALKS ABOUT AMEN THAT THE
[52:08] SCRIPTURE HAD TALKED OF THIS GREAT TREE
[52:11] THAT THE INSECTS WOULD come and and
[52:14] would start eating this tree down. And
[52:17] we understand that on the day of
[52:19] Pentecost, the church was born and the
[52:22] great miracles AND POWER, THE BLESSINGS
[52:25] OF GOD WERE UPON IT, the anointing was
[52:29] upon that church.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. FOR THE SAME SPIRIT THAT WAS IN
[52:34] JESUS CHRIST, THE APOSTLE Paul said, if
[52:37] the spirit that raised Jesus from the
[52:40] dead dwell in you, IT WILL ALSO ANOINT
[52:44] YOU. IT WILL quicken you.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT ANOINTING WILL
[52:49] DO. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? THE BIBLE SAYS
[52:52] THERE IN ACTS, IT SAYS HOW THAT GOD WENT
[52:55] ABOUT UH DOING JESUS WENT ABOUT DOING
[52:58] GOOD AND HEALING ALL THAT WERE oppressed
[53:00] of the devil. Amen. For he WAS ANOINTED
[53:05] OF THE HOLY GHOST. SO THE SAME ANOINTING
[53:10] THAT JESUS had is the same anointing
[53:13] upon the word bride.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you SAY AMEN? NOW, SATAN COMES
[53:19] IN AND HE TRIED TO HE TRIED TO TAKE THE
[53:22] LIFE OUT AND HE did tried to Amen. TAKE
[53:25] THE LIFE OUT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL TREE,
[53:28] this great tree of God, the great tree
[53:30] of life, if you will, of which you and I
[53:33] are a member of. A and we've SEEN IT GO
[53:36] DOWN THROUGH THE DARK AGES AND HOW THAT
[53:39] AMEN. IT JUST it it got to so WORMY AND
[53:42] IT GOT so so rotten until there was
[53:45] nothing LEFT OF THE TREE. ALL OF THE
[53:47] insects had eaten it up. AND THAT'S
[53:50] EXACTLY WHAT the scripture said WAS
[53:53] GOING TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE IN THE OLD
[53:55] TESTAMENT THERE IN THE BOOK OF JOEL, THE
[53:57] BOOK OF JOEL HAD IT SAID, AMEN. THAT
[54:00] THERE WAS GOING TO BE THE MESSENGERS of
[54:02] death and there was going to be the
[54:03] cankerworm and the palm worm and the
[54:06] locust. AMEN. AND THE CATERPILLAR THAT
[54:09] WERE GOING TO COME and eat AND GNAW AT
[54:12] GOD'S TREE UNTIL IN THE DARK AGES IT
[54:15] LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS JUST nothing left.
[54:17] It didn't look like anything like the
[54:19] day of Pentecost. It didn't look like
[54:21] there was anything. But you see, the
[54:23] roots were predestinated.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; AND THEN GOD SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE A
[54:29] RESTORATION
[54:31] AND THAT there were FOUR MESSENGERS OF
[54:33] DEATH AND there would also be messengers
[54:36] of life THAT WOULD BRING IT BACK. And
[54:39] that, Amen, it would bring restoration
[54:41] of of of God would raise a messenger up,
[54:45] amen, by the name of Luther and BEGIN TO
[54:48] PREACH JUSTIFICATION. WHAT WAS
[54:50] HAPPENING? ANOTHER branch was coming
[54:52] back. It began to grow. AMEN. AND THEN
[54:55] GOD WOULD RAISE A MESSENGER BY THE NAME
[54:58] OF JOHN WESLEY. AND HE WOULD preach
[55:01] sanctification. AND THE ANOINTING WAS
[55:03] UPON THE EARTH. AMEN. For
[55:06] sanctification.
[55:07] And then we find THAT IT CAME ON UP.
[55:10] AMEN. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE GIFTS OF
[55:11] THE SPIRIT. BUT THE ANOINTING WOULD COME
[55:14] THROUGH A PROPHET FOR TOTAL restoration
[55:19] to that church.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, remember, and we we went
[55:26] through this last week. Amen. THE
[55:29] ANOINTING IS ALWAYS GOD'S GOD'S WORD.
[55:33] AGAIN, GOING BACK. AMEN. If if I'm not
[55:35] too repetitious, the the the uh
[55:39] anointing OR THE PILLAR OF FIRE OR THE
[55:42] LOGOS OF GOD. AMEN. The word, the living
[55:47] WORD OF GOD HAS GOT TO COME IN EACH AGE.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; EACH AGE THAT ANOINTING COMES SO THAT
[55:54] THE WORD CAN LIVE in human beings. Now
[55:58] again you you know in Luther's day the
[56:01] church still didn't look like it did on
[56:03] the day of Pentecost.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It still didn't look like it
[56:08] didn't look like that original tree. It
[56:10] didn't look like uh the the Jesus that
[56:12] WAS WALKING HERE ON THE EARTH. BUT IT'S
[56:14] GOD'S DESIRE AND IT'S GOD'S PROPHETIC
[56:18] WORD THAT THERE WOULD BE A RESTORATION
[56:22] &gt;&gt; THAT THERE WOULD BE A FINAL
[56:24] MANIFESTATION OF the sons of God. Can
[56:27] you say amen? Amen. Now, NOW WE
[56:30] UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROPHECY THAT THAT
[56:32] MOSES HAD given there in Deuteronomy
[56:34] 32:1. Give ear, oh ye heavens, and I
[56:38] will speak and hear, O earth, the words
[56:40] OF MY MOUTH. MY DOCTRINE SHALL DROP AS
[56:43] the rain. My speech shall distill as the
[56:47] dew, as the small rain upon the tender
[56:50] herb, and as the showers upon the grass.
[56:53] AMEN. SO GOD'S GOD'S UH UH H GOD'S
[56:57] PROPHECY, GOD IS TELLING US THAT THE
[57:00] ANOINTING WOULD COME. THERE WOULD BE A
[57:03] SEASON OF great maturity.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. AND WHEN GOD IS
[57:10] GOING TO DO THIS, RESTORATION must come
[57:14] from through a prophet messenger. NOW,
[57:17] WE UNDERSTAND THAT. AMEN. IT'S THE HOLY
[57:20] SPIRIT that is through that prophet.
[57:23] AMEN. THAT IS POURING THAT WATER. AMEN.
[57:27] WHEN GOD COMES TO EARTH, HE ALWAYS USES
[57:31] a prophet messenger. And I want you to
[57:33] remember that the anointing HAD TO FLOW.
[57:37] AMEN. UH THROUGH THOSE. We had the we
[57:39] had the lion anointing. We had the ox
[57:42] anointing. We had the man anointing. And
[57:45] then we have the eagle anointing. THIS
[57:49] IS GOD'S ANOINTING COMING through the
[57:52] messages in their distinct seasons. And
[57:56] I want you to understand that. Amen. IF
[57:58] YOU WANTED TO WALK WITH GOD, YOU HAD TO
[58:02] WALK ACCORDING TO THE ANOINTING THAT WAS
[58:05] UPON THE EARTH.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, as as the prophet would say,
[58:12] AMEN. BUT IN THIS church age, the
[58:15] message is being poured into the church.
[58:19] Another place he says, "BUT WHAT THIS
[58:21] MAN WAS POURING THE WATER, the messenger
[58:24] to the church, pouring the message into
[58:27] the church." But what IS THAT WATER
[58:29] DOING? AMEN. He He's TALKING ABOUT THAT
[58:32] HOLY SPIRIT THAT IS COMING ON IN. AMEN.
[58:34] HE SAYS, "YOU DON'T COME TO CHURCH JUST
[58:36] TO HEAR A MESSAGE, just to see a
[58:38] messenger. YOU COME TO HEAR THE
[58:41] MESSAGE." AND THE MESSAGE IS THE HOLY
[58:44] GHOST TAKING the word and giving it to
[58:48] you. NOW, WHEN GOD'S ANOINTING IS HERE,
[58:51] AMEN, we we used to we we used to think
[58:54] that it was running the aisles. We used
[58:55] to think back in Pentecost that it was
[58:58] jumping up and down. We used to call
[59:00] Amen a lot of things the anointing.
[59:03] Amen. But you see the anointing IS THE
[59:07] LIFE UPON THE WORD to live in human
[59:11] beings.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; That's the anointing. Well, praise the
[59:14] Lord. Amen. I tell you what the
[59:16] anointing was is is when when Jesus is
[59:20] walking up and there was a funeral
[59:21] procession. Amen. And he said, "The
[59:23] spirit of THE LORD GOD," HE'S ALREADY
[59:25] declared it. "The spirit of the Lord God
[59:27] is upon me and he hath anointed ME." AND
[59:31] HE WALKS UP THERE ACCORDING TO THE WILL
[59:33] OF THE FATHER AND HE RAISES THE BOY UP.
[59:36] WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS THE anointing in ITS
[59:39] SEASON ON A BODY. WELL, PRAISE THE LORD.
[59:44] Not even death could stand IN ITS WAY.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. WHEN YOU TRULY
[59:50] UNDERSTAND THE ANOINTING THAT IS UPON
[59:52] you as the bride OF JESUS CHRIST, YOU'LL
[59:54] UNDERSTAND, AMEN, THAT GOD IN YOU is is
[59:59] the majority.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT GOD IN YOU, IF
[1:00:03] YOU COULD JUST UNDERSTAND THE ANOINTING
[1:00:07] THAT IS upon you as the believer here
[1:00:10] this morning.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Now, Amen. Now
[1:00:16] remember he would say now he says this
[1:00:20] is the SETTING OF THE GREAT BATTLE. THE
[1:00:22] PEOPLE THAT REJECTS GOD'S message
[1:00:25] rejected the Holy Spirit. The messenger
[1:00:27] of the seven churches. Amen. The one
[1:00:30] that rejected the message of his grace
[1:00:32] has nothing left but judgment. Amen. And
[1:00:34] so we don't WANT TO BE THAT kind of a uh
[1:00:38] we we don't WANT TO BE THAT KIND OF
[1:00:40] PEOPLE WHO REJECTS THE ANOINTING WHEN
[1:00:44] THE ANOINTING COMES. NOW, BROTHER
[1:00:46] BRANDHAM, in 1962, Amen. Uh and I I want
[1:00:50] you to just bear with me for a few
[1:00:51] moments here this morning. AMEN. HE
[1:00:53] WOULD BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE THERE WAS
[1:00:56] THE THE TALK OF THE LATTER RAIN THAT
[1:00:58] WE'RE THAT THAT THE LATTER RAIN. WE'RE
[1:01:01] PRAYING FOR THE LATTER RAIN. BROTHER
[1:01:03] BRANDHAM WOULD say in the invisible or
[1:01:05] or in uh um uh the spoken word is the
[1:01:08] original seed. AMEN. HE WOULD SAY, "YOU
[1:01:11] HAVE TO HAVE THE FORMER RAIN BEFORE YOU
[1:01:14] CAN HAVE THE LATTER RAIN."
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; And they would be asking, "Well, what is
[1:01:18] the former rain?" Well, the former rain
[1:01:21] was the rain that that that fell upon
[1:01:23] the seeds. Amen. And caused the crop to
[1:01:27] grow. THE LATTER RAIN WAS TO USHER IN
[1:01:30] THE HARVEST. IT WAS THE HARVEST RAIN TO
[1:01:33] MATURE the fruit. AMEN. SO HE WOULD SAY
[1:01:36] IN IN THE IN IN THE SPOKEN WORD IS THE
[1:01:39] ORIGINAL SEED. HE WOULD SAY, "NOW
[1:01:41] REMEMBER THE WORD MOA." AMEN. Mu or m o
[1:01:46] u r e h. That means teaching. AMEN. THE
[1:01:49] FORMER REIGN IS THE MORA REIGN. THE
[1:01:53] teaching reign. The teaching reign went
[1:01:55] forth. Amen. And it struck the world. Uh
[1:01:58] uh Billy Graham struck the world.
[1:02:00] Pentecost has struck the world. The
[1:02:01] world the word has struck the world. She
[1:02:03] He He says now she is waiting for the
[1:02:07] latter rain. That's when she produces
[1:02:10] her fruit. He says I hope you get her.
[1:02:13] Then the kind of seed you have planted
[1:02:16] in your field will be THE KIND OF CROP
[1:02:19] THAT YOU WILL REAP. NOW, NOW LISTEN,
[1:02:21] THERE HAD TO BE THAT PROPHETIC rain
[1:02:25] anointing. THAT HAD TO BE, and it's got
[1:02:29] to be. So if there's ever a serious
[1:02:31] time, it should be now TAKING GOD'S
[1:02:36] TEACHINGS THAT CAME THROUGH THAT PROPHET
[1:02:38] MESSENGER AND LETTING THOSE SEEDS find
[1:02:42] root in our heart.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONLY THOSE SEEDS ARE GOING TO
[1:02:49] produce the fruit of God's uh of this
[1:02:53] season.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; What is the fruit of this season? Well,
[1:02:56] this is the rapture season. This is THIS
[1:02:58] IS THE ADOPTION SEASON. This is the
[1:03:01] season of the manifested sons. This is
[1:03:03] the season. AMEN. TO FIND WHO WHO WE
[1:03:06] TRULY ARE. SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE
[1:03:10] TEACHING RATE. WE HAD TO HAVE A PROPHET
[1:03:13] TO COME AND teach us. Well, praise the
[1:03:16] Lord.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; TAKE THOSE WORDS AND BEGIN TO TEACH THEM
[1:03:20] AND LET THE LET THE DOCTRINE FALL LIKE
[1:03:23] RAIN UPON THE PREDESTINATED SEA. YOU
[1:03:27] SEE, YOU WERE ALREADY PREDESTINATED. YOU
[1:03:30] WERE ALREADY CALLED FOR THIS SEASON. BUT
[1:03:32] IT REQUIRED THE RIGHT KIND OF RAIN. IT
[1:03:36] REQUIRED AMEN. THAT DOCTRINE.
[1:03:39] HALLELUJAH. NOT A REFORMER'S DOCTRINE,
[1:03:42] NOT A NOT NOT A A A A A AN EVANGELIST'S
[1:03:47] DOCTRINE, BUT IT REQUIRED IT REQUIRED
[1:03:50] THE DOCTRINE IN ITS season from its
[1:03:54] prophet messenger. Right.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I'LL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE
[1:03:59] PROPHET, and he will turn your hearts.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; It is in THE SEASON. IT'S IN THE SEASON.
[1:04:11] AMEN. TO WHERE OUR HEARTS NOT JUST NOT
[1:04:14] JUST LOOKING AT A SCRIPTURE OF
[1:04:16] justification or LOOKING AT ANOTHER
[1:04:18] SCRIPTURE, BUT THIS WOULD be a LITERAL
[1:04:22] TURNING OUR HEARTS BACK to what God
[1:04:25] originally had in his mind at the
[1:04:27] beginning.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So God's not in
[1:04:32] denominations. Denominationalism is the
[1:04:34] very thing that has sown THE SEEDS OF
[1:04:36] DISCREPANCY. DENOMINATIONALISM IS THE
[1:04:39] VERY THING THAT HAS TAKEN EXPECTANCY OUT
[1:04:42] OF OUR HEARTS. DENOMINATIONALISM,
[1:04:45] AMEN, HAS MADE US JUST ACCUSTOMED TO
[1:04:47] being church members and sitting on a
[1:04:49] pew and just having a preacher preach TO
[1:04:51] US AND BECOMING COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
[1:04:54] THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS LAST DAY
[1:04:57] MESSENGER. HE WAS TO LITERALLY TURN OUR
[1:05:01] HEARTS BACK TO WHAT GOD HAD in his mind
[1:05:06] at the beginning. Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Now, amen. Now, he would say, "Amen." He
[1:05:16] would say that the latter reigns when
[1:05:18] she's going to produce her fruit. I hope
[1:05:21] you get her now. And he says, "The word
[1:05:24] is going to produce sons and
[1:05:26] daughters."Uh,
[1:05:28] right? That's coming too. What? Now,
[1:05:31] look at THE GREAT LATTER RAIN supposed
[1:05:33] to be done. How they WOULD RUN OVER THE
[1:05:36] WALL, LEAP OVER, HOW THEY WOULD BE IN an
[1:05:38] ar be AN ARMY COMING. JUST WAIT A
[1:05:41] MINUTE. UHHUH. THAT KIND OF CROP IS WHAT
[1:05:44] YOU'LL GET IS THE CRIME IS THE KIND OF
[1:05:48] seed you put in your field. NOW I UH
[1:05:52] DENOMINATIONAL
[1:05:54] uh creeds will produce uh will produce
[1:05:57] fruit. They'll produce after their kind.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; They'll produce church members. They'll
[1:06:02] produce those kinds of things. But God's
[1:06:05] interested in word made flesh.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; SO GOD SENDS US A PROPHET. GOD WILL NOT
[1:06:14] REVEAL HIS SACRED word through any other
[1:06:17] way than through a prophet messenger.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; THE SEEDS THAT GOD HAS HAS DESIRED THAT
[1:06:27] GOD HAS DESIGNED FOR THE DAY COULD NOT
[1:06:30] be um TRUSTED IN THE HAND OF just any
[1:06:35] man. He had to raise a special man for
[1:06:39] that divine purpose.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; But you see, he says NOW THERE'S TWO
[1:06:44] DENOMINATIONAL KINDS. AMEN. They'll
[1:06:46] unite together to GO TO SODOM. BUT THE
[1:06:49] WORD WILL STAY WITH THE ELECT, THE ROYAL
[1:06:52] SEED. JESUS SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS
[1:06:56] OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT be in THE COMING
[1:06:59] OF THE SON OF MAN." WHY IS THIS
[1:07:01] HAPPENING? IS BECAUSE THERE MUST COME AN
[1:07:05] END time anointing.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; We have made the anointing into
[1:07:13] feelings, not God.
[1:07:16] We have made the anointing into a good
[1:07:19] service, not God.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS WORD,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Living word,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING IS ALWAYS, IT'LL NEVER
[1:07:31] CHANGE. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT ANOINTING IS GOING TO FALL IN
[1:07:35] THIS IN the la in the last days. Matthew
[1:07:37] 5:45, that you may be children of your
[1:07:39] father which is in heaven. For he makes
[1:07:41] his son to rise, the anointing to rise
[1:07:45] on the evil and on the good and sends
[1:07:48] rain, his anointing on the just AND THE
[1:07:52] UNJUST. PAUL PICKS it up and he says
[1:07:54] there in Hebrews 6:7, "And the earth
[1:07:57] drinks and the rain that comes off on it
[1:08:00] and brings forth herbs, meat for them by
[1:08:03] whom it is dressed, and receives
[1:08:06] blessing FROM THE GOD. BUT THAT WHICH
[1:08:09] BEARS THORNS AND briars is rejected AND
[1:08:11] IS NIGH IN THE CURSING WHOSE END IS TO
[1:08:14] BE BURNED. SO THE ANOINTING IS NOT JUST
[1:08:18] FALLING on a certain group. It's falling
[1:08:22] upon the earth. Amen. And in in fact
[1:08:25] Joel says, amen that I'll pour out of my
[1:08:28] spirit upon all flesh.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now,
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; so the anointing,
[1:08:39] THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL. AMEN. We
[1:08:42] understand that that was exactly what
[1:08:45] happened through the teaching, that
[1:08:48] teaching rain, that former RAIN THAT
[1:08:52] FELL. AMEN. Uh as the dew from heaven
[1:08:56] UPON YOUR CROP,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; THAT BROUGHT YOU UP. EVERY PREDEST GOD
[1:09:02] KNOWS EXACTLY who you are.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's for a purpose.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; That's for his word to come. Now he
[1:09:14] would say he would say Joel's Joel said
[1:09:17] we we we fuss so much about latter rain
[1:09:19] had movements called latter rain, former
[1:09:22] rain, inner rain, outer rain. I was
[1:09:24] reading the other days, do do you know
[1:09:27] what former rain means in the Hebrew
[1:09:29] word? I in the Hebrew word, I can't call
[1:09:32] it now. Uh I I I I didn't write it down.
[1:09:35] It skips my mind. But the former reign,
[1:09:37] the first reign is a reign of teaching.
[1:09:40] The second reign is the spirit that
[1:09:44] comes upon what has been taught and
[1:09:47] produces the crops.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you want to shout
[1:09:51] because we're living in the day of the
[1:09:54] former and the latter.
[1:09:57] And it's not going to be it's not going
[1:09:59] to be manufactured. IT CANNOT BE
[1:10:02] MANUFACTURED. You can you can do
[1:10:05] anything and everything you can to try
[1:10:07] to bring a MOVE OF GOD. THERE'S NO WAY
[1:10:09] YOU CAN BRING A move of God. IF A MAN
[1:10:13] STARTS THE MOVE, A MAN can end the move.
[1:10:16] BUT WHEN GOD STARTS THE WORK AND THAT
[1:10:20] PREDESTINATED SEED IS ON IS IS ON THE
[1:10:23] EARTH IN THE EARTH AND THE PROPHETS'S
[1:10:26] MESSAGE HAS COME AND IT anoints the
[1:10:30] seeds it will produce after its kind.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of THE LORD.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; EVERY SEED must produce after its kind.
[1:10:42] God made man in his image after his kind
[1:10:46] to be his word on the earth. He
[1:10:48] expressed IT IN JESUS CHRIST. WHAT WAS
[1:10:51] GOD WAS IN CHRIST. THAT'S A MAN AFTER
[1:10:55] HIS KIND. OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? When
[1:10:58] Jesus come and he stood up there and
[1:11:00] says, "The Lord God has anointed me."
[1:11:05] Anointed me. He was God's predestined
[1:11:08] seed for that season. He was carrying
[1:11:11] the seeds of predestination. AND WHEN
[1:11:14] THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET, AMEN, CAME
[1:11:17] UPON HIM, AMEN, AND WATERED THOSE WORDS,
[1:11:20] BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; They came and said, "Now listen." Amen.
[1:11:28] He He said, "You he" He goes, he meets
[1:11:30] him down there at the water and and he
[1:11:32] says, "Baptize me." And John says, "I
[1:11:34] can't baptize you. I know who you are."
[1:11:38] He says, "Oh, suffer it to be so that we
[1:11:41] might fulfill all righteousness."
[1:11:43] Scriptures declaring it. Are you? It
[1:11:46] takes It TAKES A PROPHET MESSENGER TO
[1:11:49] IDENTIFY THE WORD. THE WORD MET THE
[1:11:52] PROPHET IN THE WATER. AND I WANT TO SAY
[1:11:54] THE WORD MET THE OUR PROPHET IN THE
[1:11:57] WATER THERE ON SPRING STREET. WHAT WAS
[1:12:00] IT? IT WAS A PROPHET INTRODUCING THE
[1:12:04] MESSIAH, GOD'S ANOINTED WORD. AMEN.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; BUT WHY WAS GOD'S ANOINTED WORD
[1:12:13] INTRODUCED?
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; IT WAS introduced for you as rain.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; As rain falling upon, Amen. the elect's
[1:12:26] heart to bring about the last day moving
[1:12:30] of God. Amen. That'll produce a rapture.
[1:12:32] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "Now Jesus expressed
[1:12:36] it." Amen. What was it? God in Christ.
[1:12:39] That's a man after God's kind. See?
[1:12:42] Amen. He says, "When the word was in
[1:12:45] Christ, a man, a human being, expressing
[1:12:47] itself through him, that was God, the
[1:12:50] word in Christ, expressing itself. And
[1:12:53] God in the beginning made man in his own
[1:12:55] image." AND THAT'S THE KIND OF MAN THAT
[1:12:59] GOD MAKES TODAY.
[1:13:02] this seminary and incubator hatchery
[1:13:05] turns out a bunch of hybrids AND SEE THE
[1:13:08] SCHOOLS. BUT WHEN GOD CALLS A MAN, HE'S
[1:13:11] IN HIS own image. The word made alive in
[1:13:16] him. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE HE IS. THAT'S
[1:13:18] GOD'S MAN. MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, IN HIS
[1:13:22] VERY LIKENESS. AND JESUS SAYS, "He'll do
[1:13:25] the works that I do."
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; The anointing.
[1:13:31] Amen. This
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; bearing fruit, God's fruit
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; in the prophet's season.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the fullness of God, that's
[1:13:45] what it takes. Now, and I hope I'm not
[1:13:48] reading too many too much to you here
[1:13:50] this morning.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; I just I just wanted to bring some of
[1:13:53] this to you. Amen. This is all so rich
[1:13:56] to me.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Christ is our Moses.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was veiled in human flesh. He's
[1:14:03] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:14:05] He was veiled in the tabernacle by
[1:14:07] badger skin. And this time, he's veiled
[1:14:09] in a man. And he is still Christ, the
[1:14:13] promised word for this age,
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; veiled in human flesh. The word is God.
[1:14:21] The anointing is a person. So, HE'S
[1:14:24] TALKING ABOUT THAT ANOINTING AGAIN, the
[1:14:26] anointing coming upon the word for the
[1:14:28] day. He says, "THEREFORE, MOSES WAS
[1:14:31] CHRIST FOR HIS DAY. He was THE REDEEMER,
[1:14:33] THE ANOINTED ONE." AMEN. THE PROMISED
[1:14:35] WORD FOR THIS AGE MUST ALSO BE VEILED.
[1:14:38] SINLOVING MEMBERS, unbelievers of the
[1:14:40] church cannot SEE IT BECAUSE OF THE
[1:14:42] HUMAN VEIL. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But there's a prophetic body. He
[1:14:48] says there from a little group of that
[1:14:51] true seed of the word, GOD WILL PRESENT
[1:14:54] CHRIST, A BELOVED BRIDE, a virgin, a
[1:14:58] virgin of his word THROUGH THEM AND BY
[1:15:00] THEM WILL BE FULFILLED. ALL THAT HAS
[1:15:03] BEEN PROMISED FOR HIS word in the virgin
[1:15:06] who KNOWS NO MANMADE CREEDS OR DOGMAS.
[1:15:09] THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT
[1:15:13] WAS IN MARY, GOD HIMSELF MADE MANIFEST.
[1:15:17] HE WILL ACT HIMSELF BY HIS OWN WORD OF
[1:15:20] PROMISE TO fulfill all that has been
[1:15:23] written of him.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You cannot stop what God's going to do
[1:15:30] in this in this generation. You cannot
[1:15:34] stop.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You are holding predestinated seeds in
[1:15:41] your body. RIGHT
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; IN THAT SOUL, THERE IS A PREDESTINATED
[1:15:47] WORD BORN. AMEN. A A SEED OF GOD WITHIN
[1:15:51] you
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; and it's got to come to pass. It's got
[1:15:55] to bring it on. It's going. Someone
[1:15:57] says, "Yeah, but what if no one believes
[1:15:59] it?" Amen. Everyone of God's elect is
[1:16:02] going to believe it.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Every one of God's elect's going to
[1:16:10] believe it. You say, "Well, good. That
[1:16:11] just takes away all the pressure for me
[1:16:13] and I Hallelujah. Amen. That means if
[1:16:16] you just keep on continuing on this way
[1:16:17] with all of your games and with all of
[1:16:19] your junk when God's WANTING TO BRING
[1:16:21] AMEN. He knows exactly He knows how
[1:16:24] exactly what to get. He knows exactly
[1:16:27] what to do. HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO
[1:16:29] BRING YOU AROUND. YOU'RE GOING to come.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO
[1:16:36] THAT ANOINTING.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING to to the serpent's
[1:16:47] children this morning.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING TO AMEN. UH THE THE
[1:16:51] FOOLISH VIRGIN THIS MORNING.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; I AM PREACHING TO THE ELECT OF GOD. AND
[1:16:56] YOU'VE BEEN PREDESTINED TO SHINE THE
[1:16:58] GLORY. YOU'VE BEEN PREDESTINED. GOD'S
[1:17:00] CHOSEN YOUR BODY TO LIVE HIS LIFE
[1:17:04] THROUGH. AMEN.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; NOW, God sent you a messenger
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; so that the anointing
[1:17:13] could come every time. Every time. I I
[1:17:16] love the way he put it. He poured he
[1:17:18] just like pouring the anointing oil. He
[1:17:21] says he has poured the message
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; into the bride.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; He's poured the message.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, the anointing has been poured into
[1:17:32] the Hallelujah. Can you say
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. So, here's here's here's the
[1:17:40] kicker. Amen. Satan is going to do
[1:17:42] everything that he can. Amen. To take
[1:17:45] away from what God has done. But here's
[1:17:49] here's the news. MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE
[1:17:55] AND ANOTHER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; THE SHEEP WILL ONLY KNOW GOD'S VOICE.
[1:18:02] AMEN.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Some says, "Well, whoa, I I I'm afraid
[1:18:05] I'm going to be deceived. I've got to
[1:18:06] quit." Amen. I, you know, we got to quit
[1:18:08] because we've heard and and and we don't
[1:18:10] want to be in a cult and we don't want
[1:18:11] to be this and we don't want to be that.
[1:18:13] Hallelujah. Amen. Well, they've done the
[1:18:15] same thing when the anointed word in
[1:18:17] Jesus Christ was there.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. They called Jesus IN A CULT. WHY?
[1:18:22] BECAUSE, WELL, THEY DIDN'T. THE word
[1:18:23] cult wasn't around those days. Amen. But
[1:18:26] they did call him a bibub. They did call
[1:18:28] him a fortune teller. They did call him
[1:18:30] all of these other names. They kicked
[1:18:33] him out of their church. AMEN. THEY PUT
[1:18:36] PEOPLE IN UH PRISON FOR BELIEVING IN
[1:18:39] JESUS BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT JESUS WAS
[1:18:42] AN OCCULT LEADER.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOD'S WORD IN A BODY.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOD'S DESIGN. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:18:54] AND GOD HAS GOT A DESIGN. THERE'S GOING
[1:18:58] TO BE A BRIDE. THIS BRIDE IS GOING TO BE
[1:19:01] PURE AND SPOTLESS. THIS BRIDE IS NOT
[1:19:05] GOING TO HAVE SIN ON HER. THIS BRIDE'S
[1:19:08] GARMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE, AMEN.
[1:19:12] SPOILED, AMEN, BY THE PROSTITUTES OF
[1:19:15] THIS OF THE SYSTEMS OF THIS AGE. SHE'S
[1:19:18] GOING TO LOVE GOD. AND HIS LOVE, HIS
[1:19:22] ANOINTING, HIS GLORY IS GOING TO come
[1:19:26] upon her.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Isaiah the 60th chapter. Amen. Arise,
[1:19:39] shine, for thy light has come and the
[1:19:43] glory of the Lord is risen. Now, here's
[1:19:46] that anointing. Light and anointing come
[1:19:48] up upon you. The glory of the Lord is
[1:19:51] risen upon thee. And behold, the
[1:19:53] darkness shall cover the earth, and the
[1:19:55] gross darkness the people, but the Lord
[1:19:58] shall arise upon thee, and his glory
[1:20:03] SHALL BE SEEN UPON THEE. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:08] So that tells me IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW
[1:20:10] DARK THE NIGHT GETS, HOW SICK MY BODY
[1:20:13] GETS, HOW BAD HOW IMPOSSIBLE MY
[1:20:17] SITUATION LOOKS. THERE IS AN ANOINTING
[1:20:22] AND I'm resting in assurance. You're not
[1:20:25] going to make it HAPPEN A DAY BEFORE.
[1:20:27] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN A DAY
[1:20:29] AFTER. BUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING is resting
[1:20:32] NEATH THE LIGHT OF THAT ANOINTING. YES.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; OH, glory be to the lamb of God. AMEN.
[1:20:38] GOD TOLD GOD TOLD DAVID, AMEN. that
[1:20:42] David HAD ASKED, "CAN I GO TO BATTLE?"
[1:20:44] AND AND GOD TOLD HIM, HE SAID, "NO."
[1:20:47] AMEN. YOU WILL GO TO BATTLE, BUT YOU'RE
[1:20:49] NOT GOING RIGHT NOW. HE SAYS, "GO UNDER
[1:20:51] THOSE MALBERRY BUSHES, AND YOU STAY
[1:20:53] UNDER THAT MALBERRY BUSH UNTIL THERE'S A
[1:20:56] RUSTLING IN the malberry bush." Amen.
[1:20:59] Don't you GO A MINUTE BEFORE. DON'T YOU
[1:21:01] GO A MINUTE AFTER. I WILL LET YOU KNOW
[1:21:04] WHEN IT WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:21:07] DAVID WAITED THERE MAYBE FOR DAYS. AMEN.
[1:21:10] BUT WHEN THE ANOINTING COME DOWN UPON
[1:21:13] THE BUSH, AMEN. DAVID ROSE UP. WHY?
[1:21:17] BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN GIVEN A PROMISE THAT
[1:21:20] THE BATTLE WILL BE WON. THE BATTLE WILL
[1:21:23] BRING VICTORY. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:21:26] AND THE ANOINTING IS HERE ON THE EARTH.
[1:21:29] YOU CAN'T WORK IT. YOU CAN'T MANUFACTURE
[1:21:31] IT. BUT YOU ARE STANDING THERE WAITING
[1:21:34] FOR GOD'S glorious
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; anointing.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Ripening you.
[1:21:41] Ripening you. That that that little that
[1:21:43] little faith woman. Amen. THAT LITTLE
[1:21:46] FAITH WOMAN IS WAITING THERE BECAUSE
[1:21:49] SHE'S GOT SUCH INCREDIBLE PROMISES.
[1:21:52] SHE'S WAITING FOR that promise
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; She knows the anointing.
[1:22:00] There's nothing manufactured.
[1:22:03] The anointing is already on the earth
[1:22:06] for this season,
[1:22:08] for this timing.
[1:22:10] Some say, "Well,
[1:22:14] I want my children to be filled with the
[1:22:16] Holy Ghost." And I
[1:22:20] uh you you want to you want to get all
[1:22:22] in your flesh and try to make something
[1:22:25] to happen. I just say just keep the
[1:22:28] anointing flowing through your life
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; because it's got to keep flowing. If
[1:22:33] God's touched your life, just let it
[1:22:34] keep flowing through your life.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Let the anointing, it will bring every
[1:22:39] seed
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; to its fruition.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Mas and daddies, that gives you a rest
[1:22:45] in this day. That gives you a rest that
[1:22:48] every one of God's children will come to
[1:22:51] their rights. They'll come to their
[1:22:53] reality. Well, can you say amen? Maybe
[1:22:55] you're a young man, amen, that is
[1:22:57] struggling, a young lady, a struggling,
[1:23:00] AND YOU AND AND YOU WONDER. MAYBE YOU'RE
[1:23:02] WRESTLING WITHIN YOURSELF. AMEN. MAYBE
[1:23:04] MAYBE YOU'RE JUST EXACTLY, AMEN. LIKE
[1:23:07] LIKE JACOB. AMEN. JACOB HAD HAD SAID,
[1:23:11] "YES, I I'VE SEEN THE LORD. YES, I'VE
[1:23:14] SEEN THE ANGELS." BUT HE HAD STILL YET
[1:23:16] HAD not come into HIS HIS BLESSING. HAD
[1:23:20] NOT ENTERED INTO HIS BOSOM. BUT WHAT did
[1:23:22] he do when the anointing come upon him?
[1:23:26] He wrestled. Amen. Now, now the
[1:23:28] scripture says that Jacob wrestled. BUT
[1:23:30] IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK, I BELIEVE IT'S
[1:23:32] IN MICAH. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS WHEREAS
[1:23:36] WHEREIN JACOB WEPT WITH TEARS ALL NIGHT
[1:23:41] LONG UNTIL HE GOT HIS BLESSING. In other
[1:23:45] words, THERE COMES A TIME WHERE THAT
[1:23:48] SEED MUST COME. I I JUST WANT TO SAY
[1:23:51] GOD'S GOT A GREAT big old He's got a
[1:23:53] great big old clock. Hallelujah. He's
[1:23:56] got a timer on that clock. And you ain't
[1:23:58] going you you ain't GOING TO GO UP PAST
[1:24:01] AMEN. 1 SECOND. 1 mill OF A SECOND. WHEN
[1:24:05] GOD'S WHEN GOD'S CLOCK STRIKES 12 AND
[1:24:08] YOU'RE PREDESTINATED TO 12, YOU ARE
[1:24:12] GOING TO COME FORTH.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; All of your screaming and hollering and
[1:24:18] all of that. Amen. In between time is
[1:24:20] not going to do any GOOD FOR YOU AT ALL.
[1:24:22] WE are resting in the anointing upon THE
[1:24:26] EARTH. WE KNOW THIS ANOINTING IS RIGHT.
[1:24:30] WE KNOW THIS ANOINTING IS REAL. WE KNOW
[1:24:32] GOD'S WORD IN OUR IN OUR SOULS IS
[1:24:35] CORRECT. IT'S DRAWN US TO THAT
[1:24:37] ANOINTING. AND WE are resting in that
[1:24:41] promise.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[1:24:49] amen. It says that little group of the
[1:24:52] true seed of the word will God will
[1:24:55] present Christ a beloved bride, a
[1:24:56] virgin, virgin of his word, and through
[1:24:59] them and by them will be fulfilled all
[1:25:00] that's been promised for his word. And
[1:25:02] the virgin who knows who knows no
[1:25:04] man-made creeds or dogmas, the word of
[1:25:07] promise in himself like it was in Mary,
[1:25:10] God himself is made manifest. He will
[1:25:12] act himself by his own word of promise
[1:25:14] so to fulfill all that's been written of
[1:25:17] him. He does the fulfilling.
[1:25:20] A Amen. Amen. Amen. But now remember
[1:25:23] under that anointing that is here today,
[1:25:26] my sheep know my voice. THEY'RE NOT
[1:25:29] FOLLOWING ANOTHER. There is there there
[1:25:31] is a sensitivity. He is near. The living
[1:25:35] WORD IS NEAR. NOW, IT MIGHT NOT BE THE
[1:25:38] TIME FOR YOUR PROMISE TO BE MADE real
[1:25:41] yet. It might not be THAT TIME YET, BUT
[1:25:44] I WILL TELL YOU, YOU'RE UNDER A RAPTURE
[1:25:48] ANOINTING.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And under THAT RAPTURE ANOINTING, WHAT
[1:25:52] DID THE PROPHET SAY? HE SAYS DIVINE
[1:25:55] HEALING IS THE FIRST FRUITS OF THE
[1:25:58] RAPTURE.
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, no other no other messenger
[1:26:04] was able to say that. Maybe maybe they
[1:26:07] weren't able to say that. They've been
[1:26:08] preaching HEALING ALL ALONG, BUT ONLY IN
[1:26:10] OUR UNDER THE RAPTURE ANOINTING COULD
[1:26:13] OUR MESSENGER STAND UP AND SAY, "WHEN
[1:26:16] YOU SEE DIVINE HEALING, IT'S THE FIRST
[1:26:19] FRUITS OF WHAT IS FIXING TO TAKE PLACE
[1:26:21] in this generation."
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S DESIRE. GOD WANTS TO BRING
[1:26:27] THERE. THERE'S NO OTHER AGE, AMEN, LIKE
[1:26:29] THIS AGE WHERE GOD SPECIFICALLY SAID,
[1:26:32] AMEN. THAT HE WOULD COME WITH HE HE
[1:26:34] WOULD RISE WITH HEALING in his wings
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; and that you WOULD GROW UP AS CALVES IN
[1:26:42] THE STALL FOR WHEN MALACHI 4 AND5 COMES
[1:26:46] THERE WOULD be a supernatural occurrence
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; right
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; preparing preparing preparing preparing
[1:26:53] preparing can you say amen overcoming
[1:26:56] amen going through your trials having
[1:26:58] your sickness and yet God bringing you
[1:27:00] through going through your trial and God
[1:27:02] bringing you through. It's not in your
[1:27:04] It's not by your might. It's not by YOUR
[1:27:06] POWER, BUT IT'S BY MY SPIRIT, saith the
[1:27:10] Lord. I can give you no greater
[1:27:12] anointing. I can give YOU NO GREATER I
[1:27:15] IT'S NOT THE FEELING. IF IT WAS IN
[1:27:16] FEELINGS, I'D GIVE IT TO YOU. IF IT WAS
[1:27:18] IN EMOTIONS, I'D GIVE IT TO YOU. BUT I
[1:27:20] AM GIVING YOU SOMETHING THAT IS GREATER
[1:27:23] THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I'M GIVING YOU THE
[1:27:26] ANOINTED WORD.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; There you go. Can you say amen?
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:27:36] so he says as he did when he come
[1:27:39] through the virgin womb, type of the
[1:27:41] spirit womb. Now so will the virgin now
[1:27:45] accepting his word be it unto me as thou
[1:27:48] hast said though it was said by an angel
[1:27:52] while it was uh the the written word
[1:27:56] Isaiah 9 and6 they will love him and
[1:28:00] will have his potentials for he is their
[1:28:03] head they are HIS SUBJECTS
[1:28:07] SUBJECT to his headship of Christ was
[1:28:10] his Notice what harmony. Jesus never did
[1:28:14] anything until seen of the father or the
[1:28:17] father showed it to him. Watch the
[1:28:19] harmony between God and Christ.
[1:28:22] So will the bride. And he shows her his
[1:28:25] word of life. He shows her and she
[1:28:28] receives it and she never doubts it.
[1:28:32] Nothing can harm her, not even death.
[1:28:34] For if the seed be planted, the water
[1:28:38] will raise it up again. Amen. He says,
[1:28:42] "I got a big great big hallelujah." Here
[1:28:45] is the secret. The word is in the bride.
[1:28:49] The mind of Christ to know WHAT HE WANTS
[1:28:52] DONE WITH THE WORD. She does it in his
[1:28:54] name. She has thus saith the Lord.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Now he says, now when it's germatized,
[1:29:04] so the Holy Spirit waters it until it's
[1:29:06] grown and serves its purpose. They do
[1:29:09] only his will. Amen. He says, "I'll
[1:29:12] believe that no one can persuade them
[1:29:14] different. THEY HAVE THUS SAYAITH the
[1:29:16] Lord, or they'll keep still. Then they
[1:29:18] will do the works of God, for it is
[1:29:20] himself in them continuing his word to
[1:29:23] fulfill as he did complete IN HIS DAY."
[1:29:26] ALL WHEN HE WAS THERE, WHEN HE was here,
[1:29:29] all things when he was here, he did not
[1:29:31] complete. All when he was here, for it
[1:29:34] was not yet time. Can you say amen?
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] Now,
[1:29:43] I think there has to be a real
[1:29:47] there has to be a real special
[1:29:52] reverence for what God has done.
[1:29:56] Don't that that the scripture says
[1:30:00] he meant grieve not the spirit.
[1:30:04] Grieve not the spirit. Don't don't don't
[1:30:07] be grieved in that spirit that that has
[1:30:09] got you sealed. Don't
[1:30:11] don't
[1:30:14] and there's a blasphemy of the Holy
[1:30:16] Spirit. What is the blasphemy? What what
[1:30:18] what is blasphemy? Blasphemy is not
[1:30:20] can't can't be forgiven. Blasphemy won't
[1:30:22] be forgiven.
[1:30:25] When the word when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:30:27] and lives in the word to make it live
[1:30:30] and we reject that, that is blasphemy.
[1:30:34] Jesus says, "Now the sacrifice has not
[1:30:37] yet
[1:30:39] been slain. I have not given my life
[1:30:41] yet. So you can make fun of the works of
[1:30:44] God in this human being. I'll forgive
[1:30:47] you." But when the Holy Spirit is coming
[1:30:51] down in each of the seasons and you
[1:30:54] reject what God is doing, then that sin
[1:30:57] cannot be forgiven.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; So it's it's imperative to us
[1:31:04] to reverence that Holy Spirit in our
[1:31:07] lives.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; In such a way,
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; that God feels honored.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; That that anointing is always
[1:31:18] at home.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Take that anointing with you wherever
[1:31:22] you go. Can you say amen?
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Because truly God has come in our day.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; God has come.
[1:31:32] But even in that day after after the
[1:31:34] seals were open,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; he said, "Now what about the church?
[1:31:37] What kind of a messiah is the church
[1:31:39] looking for today? You the church has
[1:31:41] cried THE LOUDEST HOLLERING FOR ABOUT A
[1:31:44] MESSIAH. What are we hollering? Revival
[1:31:46] in our time back this that AND THE
[1:31:48] OTHER. WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING for to do
[1:31:50] it? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? WHAT DOES THE
[1:31:52] CHURCH WANT ANYHOW? We've already got
[1:31:54] it. God gave it to us. It's his promise
[1:31:57] of the hour. We look in the Bible and
[1:32:00] see it everywhere. anointed ones come on
[1:32:02] and made the word live again RIGHT IN
[1:32:04] THE HOUR FOR THAT HOUR. And we've got
[1:32:06] the Messiah. This is him, the word.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning was the word. The
[1:32:15] word was with God. The word was God. And
[1:32:16] the word remains God. Hebrews 13:8. The
[1:32:20] same yesterday, today, and forever. We
[1:32:22] know what is supposed to take place in
[1:32:24] this day. We're wanting a Messiah, and
[1:32:27] God gave us the Messiah, his promised
[1:32:30] word. Do you understand? See, people
[1:32:32] think, "Well, the letter kleth." No,
[1:32:34] you're missing it. The letter does kill.
[1:32:36] The letter's been laying in the book all
[1:32:39] of this time.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; But when the anointing comes upon that
[1:32:44] word to make it live, THERE IS WHERE
[1:32:48] GOD'S MESSIAH IS.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; It's
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; God's fruit in the prophet season.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:59] Some says,
[1:33:02] "Well, the we don't we we we no longer
[1:33:04] have the prophet. We, you know, we we're
[1:33:06] we're No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:33:09] The prophet's words have already been
[1:33:13] spoke. The spirit of God has already
[1:33:16] planted those seeds. It's the teaching
[1:33:19] rain."
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same word of promise is
[1:33:25] circling the globe today to make that
[1:33:29] word become material right here in this
[1:33:32] service. God can make that word become
[1:33:34] material right here in this service.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; FAITH WILL BRING IT ABOUT YOU. WE DON'T
[1:33:38] KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S THE REASON
[1:33:40] WHY WE GET A little bit discouraged. We
[1:33:42] get discouraged sometimes because we're
[1:33:44] wanting. We're wanting. We're wanting.
[1:33:45] But have YOU REALIZED? JUST STOP FOR A
[1:33:47] MINUTE. I'M not going to hold you too
[1:33:48] much longer. But when Jesus was born,
[1:33:51] JESUS WAS THE VERY SON OF GOD. He was
[1:33:55] the the the immaculate he had immaculate
[1:33:58] conception. The anointing was there. SHE
[1:34:02] WAS OVERSHADOWED. PRODUCED THE BABY
[1:34:04] JESUS.
[1:34:06] Angels come down
[1:34:08] AN THEY'RE SAYING SINGING SINGING TO THE
[1:34:11] SHEPHERDS. I MEAN, IT WAS SUPERNATURAL.
[1:34:14] HERE COMES HERE COMES BLIND ANNA THE
[1:34:18] PROPHETIST COMING IN. AMEN. AND WALKS
[1:34:20] ALL RIGHT THROUGHOUT ALL THOSE HUNDREDS
[1:34:22] OF PEOPLE RUN TO THAT CHILD and begins
[1:34:25] to prophesy. Here is Simeon the old man.
[1:34:30] He He goes OUT OF ALL OF THOSE BABIES
[1:34:32] AND WALKS UP THERE TO THE ANOINTED WORD.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Anointed word. And he says, "My eyes
[1:34:39] have seen the salvation of Israel.
[1:34:42] I've been promised this. Now catch it.
[1:34:46] IT WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE DEAL.
[1:34:49] And then you don't hear anything else
[1:34:51] for 12 years.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; You hear nothing else. The anointing on
[1:34:59] the earth.
[1:35:01] You don't hear nothing else of Jesus
[1:35:05] until he's he's lost, until his his mama
[1:35:08] and Joseph runs off and leaves him. And
[1:35:10] they have to come back. back. And when
[1:35:11] they find him, he's in the temple
[1:35:13] teaching and and and and debating with
[1:35:17] with with the priests and and they all
[1:35:20] looked at and marvel at this at this
[1:35:22] boy. Wow, this is a special boy. And
[1:35:25] then
[1:35:27] nothing.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Don't hear nothing of his 15th birthday,
[1:35:32] 17th birthday, 20th birthday. This is
[1:35:36] God on earth.
[1:35:38] 25th birthday, third, and then all of a
[1:35:42] sudden, here comes a prophet messenger
[1:35:44] around declaring, "Now's the season."
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Now, what I'm trying to say is the
[1:35:50] anoint Jesus was there. He was God's. He
[1:35:54] was that predestinated seed. He was the
[1:35:57] redeemer.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're waiting and we're
[1:36:02] waiting and we're waiting and we know
[1:36:03] God visited us in a church service. We
[1:36:06] know God said, "Amen." That he's going
[1:36:08] to do something. He's going to save our
[1:36:09] children or he's going to fill us with
[1:36:10] the Holy Ghost. And then all of a
[1:36:12] sudden, we go through amen.
[1:36:15] It's just sort of like uh uh I don't
[1:36:17] guess they do it on those TVs these
[1:36:18] days, but you know, in the old TVs, I'd
[1:36:20] go with grandpa and grandma's. Amen. And
[1:36:22] you'd have the black and white and it
[1:36:23] would be flashing in and out and then
[1:36:24] all of a sudden those little lines then
[1:36:27] flash back on and you know, wasn't
[1:36:29] having a clear connection. And you're
[1:36:30] thinking, man, I must have lost
[1:36:31] connection with God. God's forgot about
[1:36:33] me. God, what's going on? this that and
[1:36:34] the other. Amen. You are God's eternal.
[1:36:37] You are God's eternal thought. The
[1:36:40] anointing has come upon you. You listen.
[1:36:43] You've heard the message of the hour.
[1:36:45] The seed of God on the inside of you has
[1:36:48] agreed with it. You know this is God's
[1:36:51] truth for this hour. Stay sincere. Stay
[1:36:55] under that anointing because it's going
[1:36:58] to produce. It's going to LISTEN. IT'S
[1:37:00] GOING IT IS GOING TO HEAL PARKINSON'S.
[1:37:03] IT'S GOING TO TOUCH CANCER. IT'S GOING
[1:37:06] to You say, "Well, BROTHER WINDOW, WHEN
[1:37:08] IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN?" WE'RE IN THE
[1:37:10] SEASON RIGHT NOW. THERE MIGHT BE A
[1:37:12] SEASON YOU MAYBE YOU'RE WALKING INTO IT
[1:37:14] THIS MORNING. MAYBE GOD'S GOING TO OPEN
[1:37:16] A BLIND EYE THIS MORNING. MAYBE GOD'S
[1:37:18] GOING TO HEAL A LIVER THIS MORNING. I
[1:37:20] DON'T KNOW. UNDER THAT ANOINTING, STAY
[1:37:23] THERE.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; DON'T QUESTION YOUR ANOINTING. DON'T
[1:37:28] QUESTION WHO YOU ARE. IT'S NOT IN YOUR
[1:37:30] EMOTION. IT'S IN BELIEVING WHAT GOD
[1:37:33] SAID.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] 15. Amen. Went what? See
[1:37:48] uh 15 17 years. 17 years from when we
[1:37:52] heard of Jesus at 12 years old to when
[1:37:54] he entered into his ministry at 30.
[1:37:57] See,
[1:37:59] but the Bible says that Jesus was
[1:38:01] learning obedience through the things
[1:38:04] that he suffered.
[1:38:06] There was a preparation. He was God's
[1:38:09] Messiah. Do can do you agree?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And God's Messiah is here in bodies this
[1:38:18] morning.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:21] JESUS SAID, "I CAN do nothing
[1:38:24] except the father first show me." And he
[1:38:27] was the Messiah.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Neither can you.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Neither can I do anything
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; but what the father first shows.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; But I promise you when he shows there's
[1:38:40] an anointing upon you.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour has been poured
[1:38:45] into you. Keep pouring that message. And
[1:38:47] I say get rid get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get get get get get
[1:38:48] get get get get get get rid of
[1:38:49] everything else. I mean it would do it
[1:38:51] would do a bunch of us really good to
[1:38:53] just retire our phones throughout the
[1:38:56] day and just look at your messages maybe
[1:38:58] at night for an hour and then put it
[1:39:00] back in the closet and visit again the
[1:39:02] next night. Hallelujah. Go go go back to
[1:39:04] the the the oldfashioned telephones
[1:39:07] where Well, come on now. Amen. To where
[1:39:10] the anointing Hallelujah. Someone
[1:39:11] pointing at Sister Carol. She already
[1:39:13] does that. Amen. and uh but uh the but
[1:39:17] the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:39:20] The anointing of the Holy Spirit, we're
[1:39:22] not waiting for some kind of a
[1:39:24] supernatural charge. Now listen, when
[1:39:27] God gets ready, I I want to tell you the
[1:39:29] prophet of God, Amen. He He would say
[1:39:31] when God would come, Amen. He would get
[1:39:34] numbed all over. He would it would be
[1:39:36] such So I know when God's going to do,
[1:39:39] he will vindicate it in your life.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. But the fact that people try to
[1:39:45] say that he was only anointed when he
[1:39:48] was seeing a vision,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; I disagree.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; He was God's messenger.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; For this hour,
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; he was anointed when God refused to talk
[1:40:05] to him for six months.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; He was anointed. He was anointed when
[1:40:13] the tax guys were after him.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; He was anointed when he told me, "Amen.
[1:40:19] Tell him I'm out. I'm I'm not here." And
[1:40:21] then him run outside the back. He was
[1:40:23] anointed.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; He was anointed.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Did he have to learn obedience through
[1:40:28] the things that he suffered? Yes. But he
[1:40:31] was anointed.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; God was raising up a Malachi 4 messenger
[1:40:36] that was going to bring the word without
[1:40:39] compromise. And there's going to be a
[1:40:42] bride that is going to rest in that
[1:40:46] word. She's going to walk under that
[1:40:49] anointing. I SAY THIS MORNING, YOU ARE
[1:40:53] ANOINTED.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my my. I love him here
[1:41:06] this morning. Praise the Lord. Yes.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; The anointed word.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; The anointed word being vindicated
[1:41:15] before any man that's born to be a son
[1:41:18] of God with a predestinated germ in him
[1:41:20] for this hour. He'll seek God's message
[1:41:22] just as sure as there is a God in
[1:41:24] heaven. Martin Luther seen it for his.
[1:41:26] Wesley seen it for his. Pentecost seen
[1:41:27] it for his. Now, what about you? Uh what
[1:41:30] by they went into a denomination here is
[1:41:32] the word condemning it. telling you that
[1:41:34] we're what we're to have today just
[1:41:36] exactly Malachi 4 and all these other
[1:41:38] promises for this hour. Amen. What do
[1:41:40] you see? What are you looking at? Amen.
[1:41:42] Here we are. The real genuine eagles
[1:41:44] here. My sheep. Uh uh here. My sheep
[1:41:47] know my voice. A stranger they'll not
[1:41:49] follow. Why? It was put in there by
[1:41:51] predestination. You were fore orained to
[1:41:54] a son of God. You were in God before the
[1:41:56] foundation of the world. You're only
[1:41:57] manifested in this day for his honor and
[1:42:00] glory. How can you do it without
[1:42:02] honoring his word and standing with
[1:42:04] every word of God? Yes, sir. WHICH YOU
[1:42:07] ARE A PART OF THAT WORD BY
[1:42:10] PREDESTINATION.
[1:42:11] BECAUSE LOOK, GOD IS THE WORD. DO YOU
[1:42:14] BELIEVE IT? WELL THEN, HE'S ALWAYS THE
[1:42:16] WORD. IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. AND
[1:42:18] IF THE WORD WAS GOD AND YOU WERE IN GOD,
[1:42:21] THE WORD, THE PART THAT YOU'RE TO PLAY
[1:42:24] WAS IN GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:42:26] WORLD. HE SEEN YOU. HE knew you. And he
[1:42:30] predestinated you to it. Can I hear an
[1:42:32] amen?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO LEAVEN AMONG YOU. THAT
[1:42:42] BRINGS THE ENTIRE FULLNESS OF THE
[1:42:45] GODHEAD BODILY AMONG YOU. COULDN'T DO IT
[1:42:47] in Luther's age. Couldn't do it in
[1:42:48] Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the
[1:42:50] Pentecostal age. But in THE DAY WHEN THE
[1:42:52] SON OF MAN WILL BE MANIFESTED, REVEALED,
[1:42:54] BROUGHT BACK, THE CHURCH TOGETHER WITH
[1:42:56] THE ENTIRE DEITY OF GOD AMONG HIS
[1:42:59] PEOPLE, showing the same signs,
[1:43:01] manifesting himself as he did at the
[1:43:04] beginning when he was manifested on the
[1:43:06] earth in the form of a prophet God.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; He says, where are you washing at?
[1:43:12] Worshiping at the house of God. You're
[1:43:15] seated in present tense
[1:43:18] anointed. Amen.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Anointed. Hallelujah. What am I What am
[1:43:25] I trying to tell you today? Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] It's the word coming on word. He said,
[1:43:31] "My message to you, church, you that's
[1:43:33] in this union, this spiritual union by
[1:43:36] the word that you're dead to those old
[1:43:38] husbands, you've been born a new. Don't
[1:43:40] try to dig him up. He's dead. If you're
[1:43:43] born again Christian, that little germ
[1:43:45] that was predestinated to you, it's word
[1:43:48] coming on word on word on word on word
[1:43:52] and coming into the full statue of
[1:43:54] Christ. That's right. So he can come and
[1:43:57] get his bride. Now we're just ready for
[1:44:00] one thing, and that's the coming of the
[1:44:02] Lord.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:06] Hallelujah. You're anointed.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; TURN TO YOUR NEIGHBOR AND SAY, "YOU'RE
[1:44:10] ANOINTED.
[1:44:12] OH, YOU'RE ANNOYED, BUT I DON'T FEEL IT.
[1:44:15] YOU'RE STILL ANOINTED. AMEN. WELL, I
[1:44:17] DON'T SEE IT. YOU'RE STILL ANOINTED.
[1:44:19] WHAT IS DRAWING YOU IN THIS LAST DAY?
[1:44:21] WHAT IS CALLING YOU? WHAT IS BRINGING
[1:44:24] YOU? AMEN. YOU COULD be sitting out of
[1:44:26] some denominational, amen, CHICKEN YARD
[1:44:29] SOMEWHERE. BUT GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO
[1:44:31] COME TO HIS WORD. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND
[1:44:34] OF FAILURES YOU HAVE. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:44:36] KIND OF UPSETTINGS THAT COME IN YOUR
[1:44:38] LIFE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THERE'S AN
[1:44:40] ANOINTING UPON YOUR LIFE AND IT'S GOING
[1:44:42] TO BRING THAT WORD TO PASS IN YOU.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS IN EVERY
[1:44:47] ONE OF YOU CHILDREN. IT'S GOING TO BRING
[1:44:48] IT TO PASS IN YOU TEENAGERS. IT'S GOING
[1:44:50] TO BRING IT TO PASS IN YOU WAYWARD ONES.
[1:44:52] IT'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS. IT'S
[1:44:54] THUS SAYAETH the Lord.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:06] Christ in this day and musicians can
[1:45:08] come. Christ in this day that we now
[1:45:11] live in identifying himself deity
[1:45:15] among the people. He's still deity
[1:45:17] because he's the word. And when we see
[1:45:19] the word living itself, then we know
[1:45:22] that man can't do that. It's deity. The
[1:45:26] word being made manifest. But man, what
[1:45:28] what what is what HAS GOD DONE IN YOUR
[1:45:30] LIFE?
[1:45:32] You couldn't do it yourself. You
[1:45:34] wouldn't have you wouldn't have come
[1:45:35] INTO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WALKED INTO THIS
[1:45:37] CHURCH SERVICE this morning.
[1:45:40] There's some OF YOU THAT COULD NOT. YOU
[1:45:42] ARE YOU ARE BOUND BY SIN. YOU ARE BOUND
[1:45:46] BY BY RELIGION. But here you SAT HERE
[1:45:49] WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE SAYING,
[1:45:51] "AMEN."
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe you resisted and resisted and
[1:45:57] resisted, BUT IT WASN'T YOUR TIME YET.
[1:45:59] WHEN THAT TIME STRUCK,
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; you came out
[1:46:08] and God says,
[1:46:10] "I've got something for you." You always
[1:46:12] were.
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:17] He knows what season.
[1:46:19] He knew that in this church age, we'd
[1:46:21] have a Malachi 4 in 1909.
[1:46:26] He knew that in this church age,
[1:46:30] this fellow would be born in 1970.
[1:46:34] He knew that Darren Martin would be born
[1:46:36] in 1950.
[1:46:39] He knew he knew. He knew
[1:46:43] he knew the exact time.
[1:46:46] He knew that you were you were going to
[1:46:48] run from him for
[1:46:50] eons of time.
[1:46:52] He knew it. All part of the plan.
[1:46:57] But there's an anointing on this earth
[1:46:59] that you are not going to you are not
[1:47:01] going to run away from.
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go through it in our minds.
[1:47:14] Sometimes we trying to figure out who we
[1:47:16] are.
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:20] Sometimes we we don't we we don't we
[1:47:22] don't know.
[1:47:24] God knows. God knows exactly who you
[1:47:27] are. God knows exactly who you are.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; You might not know. You might think you
[1:47:34] know. But why all the wrestling? Why all
[1:47:37] the wrestling?
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:40] Is because you have not anchored your
[1:47:41] heart yet. You've not come to that
[1:47:42] reality of who you are.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell you,
[1:47:48] you're a son of God.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; You're a daughter of God.
[1:47:53] and the anointing.
[1:47:55] Whether you've got whether you have got
[1:47:57] chills going up and down your spine this
[1:47:59] morning, that's I I I love all of my I
[1:48:02] love the motion.
[1:48:07] Glory to the lamb of God.
[1:48:10] Glory to the lamb of God.
[1:48:13] I guarantee you Jesus wasn't feeling the
[1:48:15] anointing as he's on the cross
[1:48:18] fulfilling all those scriptures on that
[1:48:20] day.
[1:48:24] that
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; he was God's anointed lamb.
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe
[1:48:35] maybe Jonah didn't feel the anointing in
[1:48:37] the bottom of the well,
[1:48:39] belly of the whale.
[1:48:43] Maybe the Hebrew boys didn't feel the
[1:48:46] anointing either. They didn't change the
[1:48:49] fact that the son of man wasn't there.
[1:48:52] didn't change the fact that the pillar
[1:48:53] of fire went there with Daniel.
[1:48:57] It doesn't change the fact. It didn't
[1:49:00] change the fact that while Moses was out
[1:49:02] there in the wilderness wandering around
[1:49:04] trying to find who he was, that the
[1:49:07] anointing wasn't upon him.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:21] Hallelujah.
[1:49:23] Hallelujah.
[1:49:26] I love you.
[1:49:29] What are you playing, brother Kobe?
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:49:49] [Music]
[1:49:51] that you see
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; through eyes of love
[1:49:59] a hopeless case
[1:50:03] an empty place
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; if not for grace
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:11] where would I be
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:15] you only
[1:50:19] I'm glad to see
[1:50:23] through eyes of love
[1:50:28] a hopeless case
[1:50:32] an empty place
[1:50:36] if not for grace.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sweet the sound.
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:49] All was lost.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; But now I'm found.
[1:50:57] Hope was
[1:51:00] the son of man. The word living itself
[1:51:02] again among the people. See the word
[1:51:05] itself made flesh in you. You're a
[1:51:07] reflection of this hour. The message the
[1:51:09] reflection of it. You live again.
[1:51:14] You live the life that was in Christ
[1:51:16] Jesus. You're in the presence.
[1:51:19] He says we're not a divided people. We
[1:51:21] got to be in unity because each one of
[1:51:22] us is holding a part of God. We must
[1:51:25] come together. Then the pillar of fire
[1:51:27] is manifested in the wholeness in the
[1:51:29] fullness of it. When the church sets
[1:51:30] together in heavenly places,
[1:51:33] then the fullness of the power of God is
[1:51:36] in his church. Each one of us holding
[1:51:38] spiritual gifts, spiritual offices,
[1:51:39] coming together
[1:51:41] brings the pillar fire back
[1:51:45] to the people.
[1:51:48] Oh God,
[1:51:54] oh stir my heart. Stir my heart.
[1:51:59] Stir every heart here this morning,
[1:52:01] Lord. Stir our hearts.
[1:52:04] If there's some of us that are sitting
[1:52:05] on the fence, oh God, I pray
[1:52:09] that your anointing would come upon
[1:52:11] them. Oh Jesus, that I live it exactly
[1:52:15] the way that you want them. Lord, I
[1:52:19] throw myself in there, too.
[1:52:22] Oh God,
[1:52:24] we need you this morning. Father,
[1:52:28] we yield ourselves to this anointing in
[1:52:30] this hour.
[1:52:32] Let your word live in us, through us.
[1:52:37] Oh, your fruit
[1:52:40] in the prophecies, Lord.
[1:52:43] Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] Hallelujah.
[1:52:48] Glory to God. Glory.
[1:52:55] The empty place.
[1:52:58] If not for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing
[1:53:04] grace.
[1:53:06] How sweet the sound.
[1:53:11] I once was lost
[1:53:14] but now I'm found.
[1:53:19] Hopeless cave.
[1:53:23] empty place.
[1:53:26] If not for grace, where would I be?
[1:53:31] What I be,
[1:53:34] you only know
[1:53:39] that you see
[1:53:42] through eyes of love,
[1:53:46] hopeless days,
[1:53:51] empty place.
[1:53:54] If not for grace once again, where would
[1:53:59] I be?
[1:54:02] You only know
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; that you see
[1:54:10] through eyes of love.
[1:54:14] Oh,
[1:54:18] empty place
[1:54:22] and grace. Precious Lord. Oh precious
[1:54:27] Lord,
[1:54:30] please take my hand.
[1:54:34] Lead me on
[1:54:38] and help me stand.
[1:54:42] The hope is case
[1:54:46] empty place
[1:54:50] for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing grace.
[1:54:56] Thank you, Lord. How sweet the sound.
[1:55:02] Once was lost,
[1:55:06] now I'm found.
[1:55:10] Hopeless cave,
[1:55:14] empty place,
[1:55:18] not for grace.
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:30] music fades
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; and all is stripped away
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; and I simply come
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; longing just to breathe.
[1:55:51] something that's of worth
[1:55:55] that will bless your heart.

[1:57:07] King of endless world.
[1:57:12] No one could express
[1:57:15] how much you deserve.
[1:57:22] Though I'm weak and poor,
[1:57:27] all I have is yours.
[1:57:31] Every single breath
[1:57:37] I'll bring you more than a song.
[1:57:42] For a song in itself
[1:57:45] is not what you have required.

[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll
[2:10:42] never forsake you."
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[2:10:54] I believe that
[2:11:00] we love the Lord with all of our heart.
[2:11:07] I
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:10] know I read a lot of quotes this
[2:11:12] morning,
[2:11:15] but I wanted to bring sort of
[2:11:19] bring continuity to the anointing that
[2:11:23] is here that it
[2:11:26] if we can just believe and
[2:11:29] reach up, it's it's it's with you.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's here.
[2:11:38] And
[2:11:40] while we don't put emphasis on healings,
[2:11:43] we don't put emphasis on on
[2:11:48] physical manifestations.
[2:11:51] We put the emphasis on the word and we
[2:11:54] believe that. And when we know whatever
[2:11:57] we have need of in the time that we need
[2:11:59] it, it's there.
[2:12:03] So, we're not chasing healing. We're
[2:12:06] chasing after God. His anointing is with
[2:12:09] us. Then we can reach up and grab it and
[2:12:13] bring it down to us. Whatever we have
[2:12:16] need of here this morning. Amen.
[2:12:20] Amen.
[2:12:21] And so, we appreciate your attendance.
[2:12:28] We're thankful for what God is
[2:12:31] beginning in in your life, Weston.
[2:12:37] And it's not a one It's not a one-time
[2:12:39] trip to the altar,
[2:12:43] not a one-time prayer. It's
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; it's talking to God every day and asking
[2:12:48] God for his help and his grace.
[2:12:53] And I can say that for us all. We're all
[2:12:56] that way. We all have to talk to God.
[2:13:00] But none of us can serve the Lord in
[2:13:02] ourselves.
[2:13:04] But we really can't.
[2:13:07] The sooner that we
[2:13:10] give ourselves to the Lord and surrender
[2:13:12] everything to God to do it his way,
[2:13:15] the better for all of us. Can you say
[2:13:17] amen?
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:21] And um
[2:13:24] and then we just had this

[2:17:37] believing for
[2:17:39] a miracle for him,
[2:17:42] a closer walk. Lord, I ask that you
[2:17:46] would be with these brothers, Lord.
[2:17:49] Oh God, hear their earnest cries.
[2:17:53] Meet them at their point of need.
[2:17:56] Bring deliverance, Lord.
[2:17:59] Now, Father, I pray that you'll just go
[2:18:01] with us all as we dismiss
[2:18:04] from the service, but not your presence.
[2:18:07] I pray that your anointing would be with
[2:18:09] us Lord even there in the fellowship
[2:18:11] hall.
[2:18:12] I ask Lord that you would bless the food
[2:18:15] to the health and strength of our
[2:18:17] bodies. Bless all of those Lord who make
[2:18:20] it possible every every week. We'll give
[2:18:23] you glory and honor in Jesus name.
[2:18:28] Amen. Amen.

[2:18:37] brothers dismiss us, we love you
[2:18:40] through the Lord.

[2:19:32] There is forgiveness in the presence. Oh
[2:19:36] my. Forgiveness in the presence.
[2:19:41] Forgiveness in the presence of the Lord.
[2:19:48] There's forgiveness in the presence.
