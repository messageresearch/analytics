[32:50] on you know they use it as a reason to
[32:52] stay home from church but when I've got
[32:54] a need there's no place I'd rather be
[32:56] than right here in the presence of Jesus
[32:57] Christ Christ amen if y'all would this
[33:00] evening we'll go right into the word p
[33:02] The Book of Psalms the 20th chapter
[33:04] we're going to begin in verse
[33:10] one amen it would say the Lord hear thee
[33:13] in the day of trouble the name of the
[33:16] god of Jacob defend thee send thee help
[33:18] from the sanctuary and strengthen thee
[33:20] out of Zion remember all thy offerings
[33:23] and accept thy burnt sacrifice say law
[33:25] Grant thee according to thine own heart
[33:27] and fulfill all thy counsel we will
[33:30] rejoice in thy salvation and then in the
[33:32] name of our God we will set up our
[33:34] banners the Lord fulfill all of thy
[33:36] petitions now know I that the Lord
[33:38] saveth his anointed he will hear from
[33:41] him in the his holy heaven with the
[33:43] saving strength of his right hand now
[33:45] pausing here for just a moment here in
[33:46] this sixth verse now I know the Lord
[33:49] saveth his anointed if you look this
[33:51] word saveth up in the Hebrew concordance
[33:52] it would actually mean to be victorious
[33:55] or to give Victory unto so this verse
[33:58] would read now I know that the Lord
[33:59] gives Victory unto his anointed he will
[34:01] hear him from his holy heaven with the
[34:03] saving strength of his right hand some
[34:05] Tres in chariots and summon horses but
[34:07] we will remember the name of the Lord
[34:09] Our God they are brought down and they
[34:11] are Fallen but we are risen and stand
[34:13] upright save Lord or again give Victory
[34:15] Lord let the king hear us when we call
[34:19] amen and from there going to the book of
[34:20] Isaiah the 10th chapter and we're going
[34:23] to read uh in verse 24
[34:32] it would say therefore thus sayith the
[34:33] Lord God of hosts on my people that
[34:35] dwell Us in Zion be not afraid of the
[34:38] Assyrian he shall smot thee with the rod
[34:40] and he shall lift up his staff against
[34:42] thee after the manner of Egypt for yet a
[34:45] very little while and the indignation
[34:46] shall cease and my anger in their
[34:48] destruction and the Lord of host shall
[34:50] stir up a Scourge for him according to
[34:52] the slaughter of Midian at the rock of
[34:54] orb and as his Rod was upon the sea so
[34:57] shall he live Ed up after the manner of
[34:58] Egypt and it shall come into to pass in
[35:01] that day that his burden shall be taken
[35:03] away from off of thy shoulder and his
[35:05] yoke from off of thy neck and the Yoke
[35:07] shall be destroyed because of the
[35:10] anointing amen I would like to take my
[35:12] text tonight out of this passage and for
[35:14] a title I would take a Victorious People
[35:17] through an anointed message a Victorious
[35:20] People through an anointed message let's
[35:21] bow our heads this evening dear father
[35:23] Lord we count such an honor and
[35:25] privilege to be able to stand before
[35:26] your people Lord Lord as we were saying
[35:29] there's no place we would rather be Lord
[35:30] than here in your presence father Lord
[35:32] just to feel your anointing and your
[35:34] presence and your spirit come down Among
[35:35] Us father Lord I know that Lord we are

[35:42] souls that need your help and Lord I ask
[35:44] during the service Lord that we would
[35:46] that you would just move me outside and
[35:48] you would come and you would move in a
[35:49] mighty way father you would meet every

[36:03] take this broken vessel father speak
[36:04] your word I ask that this message would
[36:06] just come forth with power and authority
[36:08] and Lord that your word would come forth
[36:10] we love you and we thank you we place
[36:11] this service into thy hands in the name
[36:13] of Jesus Christ we pray amen you all can
[36:16] take your
[36:17] seats amen so laying a foundation for
[36:19] this thought we see here this scripture
[36:21] that we'll reading in Isaiah you've
[36:23] you've got to understand the backstory
[36:24] what's going on here and just a short
[36:26] little recap of the story here that is
[36:28] taking place the army of Assyria is
[36:30] marching on the kingdom of Judah and
[36:32] they have just finished taking over and
[36:34] wiping out Israel and so now they're
[36:36] marching on Judah now Assyria is one of
[36:39] Israel and judah's most formidable
[36:40] enemies we're at war with uh with
[36:43] Assyria almost constantly throughout the
[36:44] Old Testament and if you begin to look
[36:46] you will see that at this period in time
[36:48] the country of Judah while they have
[36:49] stayed with the word they have stayed
[36:51] with what God has told them to do the
[36:52] Kingdom of Israel has completely left
[36:54] the word they have completely left God
[36:56] as a matter of fact ever since the
[36:58] kingdom would be divided after king
[37:00] after King Solomon and King Jobo would
[37:02] become the first king of Israel and King
[37:03] rabom will become the first king of
[37:05] Judah after this happened there was
[37:07] never again a Godly King over Israel but
[37:09] Israel will begin to decline farther and
[37:11] farther into sin as time went on and
[37:12] because of it God has now allowed the
[37:14] king of Assyria to move in and to
[37:16] completely take over Israel to clean out
[37:18] the country and to carry them away into
[37:20] captivity and this would actually it
[37:21] would be the last time that Israel is
[37:23] ever defeated because after this point
[37:24] in time Israel would never again come
[37:26] together but these lost 10 tribes that
[37:28] would be scattered throughout the world
[37:29] and they would never again return to
[37:31] their Homeland until World War II but we
[37:33] see now it's a very PCT ugly picture for
[37:36] the king of Judah because now that he
[37:38] has overtaken Israel the Bible says that
[37:39] the king of Assyria begins to get
[37:41] boastful the Bible says he begins to get
[37:43] lifted up within himself and he begins
[37:44] to say he begins to set his eyes upon
[37:46] Judah and he says I'm going to do into
[37:48] Judah What I've Done into Samaria I'm
[37:50] going to do into unto Jerusalem what I
[37:52] have done into Samaria and this this
[37:55] struck fear Into the Heart of the king
[37:56] of Judah that he is seen what's happened
[37:58] to Israel he has heard that the Assyrian
[37:59] army is on its way he has watched what's
[38:01] just happened to the neighboring country
[38:02] right next to him and this begin to
[38:04] strick fear into his heart and he was
[38:05] afraid so what did he do did he start
[38:07] Gathering his forces mustering his
[38:09] armies Gathering his generals no the
[38:11] prophet of God or the Bible says that he
[38:12] consulted the prophet he went to their
[38:14] Prophet that was his immediate response
[38:16] when the enemy was at his Gates was that
[38:18] he would go to the prophet he went to
[38:19] Isaiah and he asked what we should do
[38:21] and so now this scripture in Isaiah the
[38:22] 10th chapter this is Isaiah's response
[38:25] to the king of judah's plea now I want
[38:27] you to not is his response he would say
[38:29] he would tell God's people don't be
[38:30] afraid of this King don't be afraid of
[38:31] this enemy this yoke of bondage shall be
[38:33] broken from off of thy shoulders because
[38:35] of the anointing because of the
[38:37] anointing not because you have followed
[38:39] me not because you are better people
[38:40] than Israel is not because you have kept
[38:42] my Commandments but because I have
[38:43] chosen you to be my anointed that
[38:45] anointing will be the reason that the
[38:47] Yoke of your bondage will be destroyed I
[38:49] will bring you freedom I will bring you
[38:50] Deliverance I will bring you Victory
[38:52] because you are my anointed I mean I
[38:54] thought that was so powerful to think
[38:55] about tonight that God would save and
[38:57] give power and Authority unto a group of
[38:58] people for no other reason than that
[39:00] they were his anointed people for no
[39:02] other reason that they were a nation
[39:04] that was chosen by God to be placed
[39:05] under this anointing amen I would like
[39:07] to begin tonight by saying I believe
[39:09] this bride is Anointed I believe I'm
[39:11] standing this evening not just before
[39:12] the Bride of Jesus Christ but before the
[39:13] anointed bride of Jesus Christ I don't
[39:16] believe there will be any dispute in
[39:17] that tonight I believe that I'm standing
[39:19] before a group that we don't just
[39:20] sympathize with this anointing it's not
[39:21] just something that sounds good oh but
[39:23] this anointing I believe is I'm part of
[39:24] a group that's just as anointed as Jesus
[39:26] was when he walked the earth I believe
[39:28] we're just as anointed as a prophet of
[39:30] God was when he brought the message of
[39:31] the hour I don't believe we have a
[39:32] lesser anointing or a smaller anointing
[39:34] I don't believe we are a lesser people
[39:36] but the same anointing that flowed
[39:38] through Christ is flowing through this
[39:39] bride the same anointing that flowed
[39:40] through the angel messenger is Flowing
[39:42] inside of every body that's coming to
[39:43] the headship of that angel messenger if
[39:46] there's one thing I want to make clear
[39:47] to that devil tonight is that I know
[39:48] that I'm anointed I know who I am I know
[39:50] where I'm going I know where I came from
[39:52] I know that I am anointed Amen brother
[39:55] Brandon would say the Messiah means ano
[39:57] anointed and if he was the Messiah
[39:59] because he was anointed with the
[40:00] fullness of God then we are anointed too
[40:03] with the same Spirit now you say how do
[40:06] you know you're Anointed with the same
[40:07] Spirit he said the same life the same
[40:09] things he did he that believeth on me
[40:11] the works that I do shall he do also
[40:13] what did he say in St John 5:19 verily I
[40:16] say unto you the son can do nothing what
[40:18] he sees the father doing and that doeth
[40:20] the son likewise any correct Messi would
[40:23] have the same message so if God does any
[40:25] one thing any child of God is going to
[40:27] do the same thing you believe that ton
[40:28] not if the Messiah does any one thing
[40:30] any Messiah is going to do the same
[40:32] thing so if God was anointed his
[40:34] children are anointed if Christ was
[40:35] anointed his bride is Anointed there's
[40:37] no question about it there's no
[40:38] wondering there is no confusion and I
[40:40] just want to tell somebody here tonight
[40:41] I don't know what you're going through I
[40:42] don't know the situations I might not
[40:44] know what you're dealing with I might
[40:45] not know what you're battling with but
[40:46] it doesn't matter if I know because I
[40:48] can stand here and I can tell you in
[40:50] confidence that you were anointed by God
[40:52] to see Victory you weren't anointed to
[40:54] be defeated you weren't anointed to
[40:55] watch the enemy Prevail in your life you
[40:57] weren't anointed to stand oh and to
[40:58] watch as the enemy comes and tramples
[41:00] over you but you were anointed to
[41:02] overcome you were anointed to Prevail
[41:04] you were anointed to conquer and Destroy
[41:05] every yoke of bondage that the enemy
[41:07] would try to place upon you you were
[41:09] anointed to see Victory I love how the
[41:11] prophet would say we are anointed too
[41:12] with the same Spirit not a similar
[41:14] Spirit not a locking Spirit but the Same
[41:16] Spirit oh in other words the spirit that
[41:18] quickened him has now been quickened
[41:19] inside of you the same spirit that Rose
[41:21] Christ from the dead is the same Christ
[41:23] is the same spirit that is Raising this
[41:24] bride from the dead Hallelujah he will
[41:27] go on he would say the Holy Spirit Body
[41:28] of Christ will move just as Christ moves
[41:31] and if Christ in heaven can never get
[41:33] his spiritual body on Earth moving as he
[41:35] wants it to move watch for things to
[41:37] happen watch for things to happen he
[41:40] would say it's beginning to come to life
[41:42] it's beginning to come to life they
[41:44] paralyzed it long enough but the holy
[41:46] spirit is bringing life into it oh my
[41:49] I'm going to read that again it's
[41:50] beginning to come to life theyve
[41:52] paralyzed it long enough but the holy
[41:54] spirit is bringing life into it and it's
[41:56] beginning to wake wake up and it's
[41:58] beginning to move because it sees its
[42:00] position oh Hallelujah church this
[42:02] anointing is bringing life into the body
[42:05] oh we are not paralyzed we are not
[42:06] stagnant we are not a dead corpse but
[42:08] this mod body is moving under the
[42:10] authority and the power of the anointing
[42:12] of Jesus Christ because we have seen our
[42:14] position and we are anointed to step
[42:16] into that position as a member of the
[42:18] bde body oh Hallelujah if Christ was
[42:20] anointed with 10 Satan I say I'm
[42:22] Anointed with sin Satan if Christ was
[42:24] anointed to raise from the dead I'm
[42:25] anointed to raise from the dead if
[42:26] Christ was anointed to overcome and to
[42:28] see total victory in every area of his
[42:31] life I am anointed by God to do the
[42:33] exact same thing because I the
[42:35] manifestation of Jesus Christ and so
[42:37] because of that I will manifest the same
[42:38] anointing I will manifest the same power
[42:41] the same Authority y'all I'm having nose
[42:43] believe y'all excuse me I will manifest
[42:45] that same power that word comes to life
[42:47] inside of this body brother Brandon
[42:49] would say as Jehovah Eagle is the Great
[42:51] Eagle we're the eaglets he's the Messiah
[42:53] and he with the same anointing we are
[42:55] the Messiahs amen anoint the Messiah
[42:58] means the anointed are you anointed amen
[43:00] what with the same spirit that he was
[43:02] anointed
[43:03] with amen Isaiah 61 verse1 a very
[43:06] familiar scripture it would say the
[43:07] spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[43:09] because Heath anointed me to preach the
[43:11] Good Tidings to the meek he has sent me
[43:13] to bind up the Brokenhearted thank you
[43:15] Heath sent me to bind up the
[43:17] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[43:18] captives and the opening of the prison
[43:20] to them that are bound to proclaim the
[43:22] acceptable year of the Lord and the day
[43:24] of Vengeance and to comfort all that
[43:26] mourn to appoint unto them that mourn
[43:28] and z and to give unto them Beauty for
[43:30] Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the
[43:32] Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[43:34] heaviness that they might be called the
[43:35] Trees of Righteousness the planing of
[43:37] the Lord that he might be glorified now
[43:39] I want you to remember here this chapter
[43:41] is speaking of Jesus Christ there's a
[43:43] prophecy of the role of Jesus Christ and
[43:45] the anointing that he will be placed
[43:46] under I thought it was so powerful that
[43:48] before the prophet of God would ever
[43:50] come along and he would show us that
[43:52] that he would show us that we are under
[43:53] the same anointing as Christ was God
[43:55] would actually give us a list of every
[43:57] everything that Jesus Christ was
[43:58] anointed to do he was anointed to preach
[44:00] the word he was anointed to bind the
[44:01] Brokenhearted he was anointed to
[44:02] Proclaim Liberty to open the prisons to
[44:04] give Beauty for Ashes Jesus Christ was
[44:06] anointed to do all these things through
[44:08] his Natural Body and now the prophet
[44:09] will come on the scene he will show us
[44:11] that everything the natural body that
[44:12] the natural always tpes of spiritual so
[44:14] if the natural body was anointed to do
[44:16] something the spiritual body will be
[44:18] anointed to do the same thing amen she
[44:20] was anointed to preach the word she is
[44:21] Anointed to bind the Brokenhearted she's
[44:23] anointed to Proclaim Liberty to open the
[44:25] prisons to get Beauty for R the church
[44:26] you are doing and denight everything
[44:28] Jesus did you were anointed to do
[44:29] everything brother Benham did you have
[44:31] been anointed to do there is no line
[44:33] there is no limit there is no you can go
[44:35] this far and you can't go any farther
[44:36] there is no there is no end to the power
[44:38] of that anointing but the same anointing
[44:40] that Jesus Christ was under is the same
[44:41] anointing that you've been placed under
[44:43] oh I say to our church this anointing is
[44:45] not going to take us part of the way it
[44:47] won't take you halfway it won't take you
[44:48] 3/4 of the way it's not going to take
[44:50] you 99% of the way but this message this
[44:52] anointing will take you all the way it
[44:54] will take you every step of the way it
[44:55] will take you every part of the way oh
[44:57] you can go so far under a denominational
[45:00] Spirit you can go so far under some menm
[45:02] be oh when this Bride Comes under the
[45:04] anointing of this message I say this
[45:06] message this anointing will carry you
[45:07] all the way excuse me it'll take you
[45:10] every step of the way it'll take you
[45:11] every part of the way oh Hallelujah
[45:13] it'll carry us through a Rapture it'll
[45:15] carry us through a body change it'll
[45:16] carry us through church problems it'll
[45:18] carry us through storms it'll carry us
[45:19] through trials it'll carry us through
[45:21] Seasons oh when the sermon why are
[45:23] people so tossed about the prophet he
[45:24] would go through the scripture and he
[45:26] will show
[45:27] he would talk about Isaiah 61 and he
[45:29] would show how that that this anointing
[45:31] would be placed upon Jesus and he would
[45:33] say now that is what's here it's not
[45:35] something we were looking for out in the
[45:36] future I love that now that is what's
[45:38] here it's not something that was was
[45:39] lost out in history it's not something
[45:41] that we've seen just how in times past
[45:42] but that is what's here he said that
[45:44] anointing that power is what is here oh
[45:46] I say Church there's an anointing here
[45:48] tonight there's an anointing in this
[45:49] building tonight there's ano the
[45:51] anointing favors the Bride of Jesus
[45:53] Christ the anointing favors you as
[45:55] members of God himself the Pentecostals
[45:57] have a portion the denominations have a
[45:59] portion brother Bram would actually say
[46:01] that man would be given a lesser portion
[46:03] oh but the body of Christ would have so
[46:05] much anointing that she will become the
[46:06] fullness of the godhead deity I said we
[46:08] have not been given a lesser portion of
[46:10] the anointing I'm not standing before a
[46:12] group of people church that you just
[46:13] have part of the anointing you just have
[46:14] a your just anointed to do any one thing
[46:16] oh but I say the full anointing of Jesus
[46:18] Christ has been placed upon you until we
[46:20] have become the fullness of God
[46:22] expressed we have been filled with the
[46:23] full anointing of God to take this
[46:25] message to take this word oh to stand on
[46:27] this word to stand on every line oh to
[46:29] apply every word to live in Victory to
[46:31] live an overcoming life oh I don't know
[46:33] about you church but I refuse oh to be I
[46:36] refuse to be satisfied with manifesting
[46:38] a portion of this message I refuse to be
[46:40] satisfied with just manifesting a part
[46:41] of this word oh when I say give me every
[46:43] word I say give me every line if the
[46:45] message said it I believe it I might not
[46:48] fully understand it I might not fully
[46:50] get it oh but give me the easy Parts
[46:51] give me the hard Parts give me the
[46:53] encouraging Parts give me the worth
[46:54] Parts if the word said it I say I'm
[46:56] going to believe it and I'm going to
[46:58] stand on it amen y'all just bear with me
[47:02] tonight we're going to get through this
[47:04] oh that devil don't want it but we're
[47:06] going to get through this
[47:07] anyway amen the prophet of God would say
[47:09] in the cross's mystery God revealed he
[47:11] would say there would be a Time come
[47:13] forth when he could express himself in
[47:14] the fullness of his godhead deity
[47:16] through his church having the pinen is
[47:19] in this church oh my what the anointed
[47:21] man now the anointed people oh I like
[47:23] that Caleb what kind of people are y'all
[47:25] over there we're anointed people oh my
[47:27] to bring back the anointed bride and the
[47:29] bridegroom anointed by why accepting
[47:32] what Eve turned down and Adam coming
[47:34] back with the anointing of the word
[47:35] because he said my word is spirit see
[47:37] Anointed with the word so we aren't just
[47:40] anointed we have been Anointed with the
[47:41] very word of God so we see brother
[47:43] bernham he would tell the church here
[47:45] that there would come a time when God
[47:46] would have a desire to express himself
[47:48] in fullness God would have a desire to
[47:50] express himself in fullness not in part
[47:52] not express just a portion of himself oh
[47:54] but there was going to come an age when
[47:55] God would want to make an Express of who
[47:57] he was of what he was of the power that
[47:59] he had of what he could do and the way
[48:01] that he was he was going to express
[48:03] himself was going to be through a group
[48:04] of people who were Anointed with the
[48:06] word an anointed people not just any
[48:08] group not just any people not just any
[48:09] church but that word was going to be
[48:11] expressed through God's anointed people
[48:13] now that word anoint it will mean to
[48:15] consecrate to identify as sacred to set
[48:17] apart for a specific purpose oh so to
[48:20] think tonight this group of people this
[48:22] anointed bride body was of people who
[48:23] were set apart for a specific purpose
[48:25] she will be consequ set aside amen I
[48:28] believe that I don't believe that God
[48:29] set me apart from before the foundation
[48:31] of the world just for any other reason I
[48:32] don't believe that God predestinated
[48:34] this body and plac it as a member of the
[48:36] body of Jesus Christ just for any old
[48:37] reason oh but if God anoints an
[48:39] individual is because he has a purpose
[48:41] for that individual oh I'm might be here
[48:43] just tell one person here tonight God
[48:44] has a purpose for your life I know
[48:46] sometimes maybe just sitting in the PE
[48:48] backing the preacher it feels like you
[48:49] ain't got a purpose I know sometimes
[48:51] you're sitting there and maybe singing
[48:52] along with a song reader maybe it feels
[48:54] like you ain't got a purpose it feels
[48:55] like that there's no reason for you to
[48:56] be here oh when I say if you are a
[48:58] member of the Bride body of Jesus Christ
[49:00] I say God the very word anoint means
[49:03] that God has given you a purpose and you
[49:05] have a role to fulfill even it's the
[49:07] tiniest role even if it's the smallest
[49:08] part brother bham said every part of the
[49:10] body must be there in order for that
[49:12] body to take a Rapture every single
[49:14] member every single part of the body
[49:16] must be there oh church you've got a
[49:18] purpose T now young people you've got a
[49:19] purpose for coming here you might feel
[49:22] useless sometimes you might feel
[49:23] helpless sometimes oh but there is a
[49:25] purpose for you coming here there's a
[49:26] there a purpose for you to come and to
[49:27] fill up these pews there's a purpose for
[49:29] you to come oh because there was a bride
[49:31] body oh and we are members of a body
[49:33] church we are members that must come
[49:35] together under that anointing in order
[49:37] for it to work there must be a group of
[49:38] people that come together brother bham
[49:40] would preach Unity over and over and
[49:42] over again why because he knew that half
[49:44] the bride could not do it he knew three
[49:46] quarters of the Bride couldn't do it but
[49:47] he knew that every single member of the
[49:49] body must come together must come
[49:51] together oh we might have differences we
[49:53] might have differences of opinion we
[49:54] might have differences in Doctrine oh
[49:56] but I say Throw aside the indifferences
[49:58] throw aside the problems you have with
[49:59] your brother and let's stand under the
[50:01] anointing of Jesus Christ let's stand oh
[50:03] under the word of God I say the
[50:05] anointing is here for the Bride of Jesus
[50:08] Christ to
[50:09] manifest
[50:11] amen excuse we know that brother
[50:13] brandham he would he would tell us if
[50:15] you begin to studying the Bible you will
[50:16] see that there were three groups of
[50:18] people that were anointed in the Old
[50:20] Testament there were the prophets the
[50:22] priests and the Kings and brother
[50:23] Brandon will go through and he will show
[50:25] how that each of these roles had the
[50:26] very special purpose that they were
[50:28] elected to perform and as God's people
[50:30] it was only under that anointing that
[50:32] they could rightly perform those duties
[50:34] the way that God had intimidated them
[50:35] for the way what they were designated
[50:37] for and we know that Jesus Christ he
[50:39] would come in a natural body and he
[50:41] fulfilled all three of those roles that
[50:43] the anointing was designated for he was
[50:45] anointed as a prophet as a son of man he
[50:47] was anointed as a priest after the order
[50:49] of melkisedek he was anointed as a king
[50:50] as the king of Heaven as the king of all
[50:52] Kings Jesus Christ came and he was a
[50:54] complete fulfillment of the word and now
[50:56] the Propet will come along he will show
[50:58] us that the anything that the body that
[51:00] the the head does the body would be
[51:02] subject to the same thing so if the body
[51:04] raised from the dead brother Bram said
[51:05] if the head raised from the dead brother
[51:07] Braham said the body must raise from the
[51:08] dead if those head is under an anointing
[51:10] the body must be under the same
[51:12] anointing so if God predestinated you if
[51:14] he elected you if he if he anointed you
[51:16] and placed you in the body of Christ is
[51:18] because he has a purpose for your life
[51:20] okay what is that purpose I'll just go
[51:21] back to what the prophet of God said he
[51:23] said that purpose is so that you God the
[51:25] word could be fully meant ested through
[51:27] you so that he can be manifested through
[51:29] you oh Church you are the manifestation
[51:31] of Jesus Christ tonight that is what you
[51:32] are you are the manifestation of the
[51:34] very of the very word that was in the
[51:36] mind of God from before the foundation
[51:37] of the world how was God alive today
[51:39] I'll tell you how God is alive today you
[51:41] are how God is alive today how is God
[51:43] moving today you are how God's moving
[51:45] today how does God do this how does God
[51:47] do that I tell you how he does it he's
[51:49] going to have an anointed individual he
[51:51] can have an anointed Church an anointed
[51:53] body an anointed group of people who
[51:55] will stand and will say I'm here Lord
[51:57] tell them what you need me to do tell me
[51:59] what purpose you have for my life tell
[52:01] me where you want me to go send me Lord
[52:03] I'll go oh Hallelujah we are living in
[52:05] the most victim mentality world ever oh
[52:08] people in the church have such a victim
[52:10] mentality where the walk in the S on the
[52:12] PE what can God do for me what can God
[52:13] do for me what can the preacher do to me
[52:16] what what can the pastor do for me I say
[52:18] Lord what can I do for you we need some
[52:20] people who will stand under the
[52:21] anointing and say Lord I know you
[52:24] elected me as a member of this body and
[52:26] so you have a purpose for my life you
[52:28] have a role that you want me to fulfill
[52:29] I say young people God has a role for
[52:31] you to fulfill because he placed you
[52:33] under an anointing and that anointing
[52:35] has given you a purpose that anointing
[52:37] has given you oh a reason to push
[52:39] forward it's given you a reason to fight
[52:42] oh I say this word is Anointed this
[52:44] message is Anointed oh this isn't just
[52:46] any word this isn't just any message we
[52:48] follow oh but I follow the most anointed
[52:50] word that has ever come forth to any
[52:52] group of people on the face of the Earth
[52:54] and we are anointed to believe it we
[52:56] anointed to manifest it oh Hallelujah
[52:59] church this body ain't going through an
[53:00] identity crisis we ain't worried about
[53:02] who we are we ain't confused about who
[53:04] we are we ain't puzzled about who we are
[53:06] but we know who we are because the word
[53:08] told us who we are he said you are an
[53:10] anointed predestinated oh holy ghost
[53:12] fied elected member of the body of Jesus
[53:15] Christ Hallelujah we are anointed for
[53:18] victory we're anointed to overcome we're
[53:20] anointed to stand on this word we are
[53:22] anointed to break the Yoke of bondage to
[53:24] stand under the headship of the message
[53:25] and to manifest his word with everything
[53:27] that we've got oh listen to what the
[53:30] prophet said there would be a Time come
[53:32] forth oh when he would Express himself
[53:35] in this fullness of his godhead deity on
[53:37] down he would say oh my to bring back
[53:39] the anointed bride oh not to make the
[53:41] anointed bride he said to bring back the
[53:44] anointed bride now the last time I
[53:46] checked the word that word to bring back
[53:48] means to restore that which already
[53:50] existed oh so to think tonight that you
[53:52] were anointed in the mind of God oh
[53:54] before the foundation of the world there
[53:56] was all already a group of people who
[53:57] was anointed in the mind of God before
[54:00] there was a world before there was man
[54:01] before there was anything oh there was a
[54:03] group of people who were anointed in the
[54:05] mind of God to express this word oh I
[54:08] say why don't you just tell that devil
[54:09] that's been battling you tonight tell
[54:10] that enemy that's been fighting with you
[54:12] say devil before you were even created I
[54:15] was already anointed to defeat you I was
[54:18] already anointed to cut your head off I
[54:20] was already anointed to stand on this
[54:23] word oh and to run the sword of the
[54:25] spirit through your heart oh I say there
[54:27] is an anointing in this building tonight
[54:29] whatever you have need of oh the
[54:31] anointing is here to fight for you the
[54:32] anointing is here oh to take this word
[54:35] oh and they're running through the heart
[54:36] of the enemy oh whatever Mountain you're
[54:38] through going through whatever Valley

[54:41] whatever trial I see there is an
[54:43] anointing here that will carry you
[54:44] through it all it will carry you every
[54:46] step of the way oh you were already
[54:48] anointed in the mind of God from before
[54:51] the foundation of the world oh when God
[54:53] predestinated you he predestinated the
[54:55] outcome of every battle you would ever
[54:57] go through every Tri you would ever face
[54:59] every storm you would ever go through
[55:01] because the moment that you are anointed
[55:02] for victory every enemy that you ever
[55:05] face was anointed to be defeated I say I
[55:08] can stand tonight in the same confidence
[55:11] that I was anointed to win I can stand
[55:13] in that same confidence that my enemy
[55:15] was anointed to lose oh Hallelujah come
[55:18] on devil you can hit me you can strike
[55:21] me you might push me down you might
[55:22] knock me down oh but I say I'm coming
[55:25] back because I was anointed to win I was
[55:28] anointed for victory I was anointed to
[55:30] overcome oh he might hit you he might
[55:33] stri you he might shove you around he
[55:35] might knock you down oh brother Bram
[55:37] said the difference between excuse me
[55:39] between a Believer and an unbeliever is
[55:41] when the unbeliever Falls he stays down
[55:43] when the unbeliever goes down he stays
[55:45] down oh but when a Believer falls to the
[55:48] ground a Believer stands back up he says
[55:50] I know I am anointed I know I've got the
[55:53] Holy Ghost I know I've Got The Power of
[55:55] God I know who I am I know where I'm
[55:57] going I know that I can overcome because
[56:00] there is an anointing place inside of my
[56:02] life that I know I can see
[56:04] Victory oh
[56:06] hallelujah
[56:09] hallelujah brother Brandon would say
[56:10] that Jesus was the most anointing man to
[56:12] ever walk the face of the Earth so to
[56:14] think tonight the same amount of
[56:15] anointing that was placed on Jesus has
[56:19] now been placed inside of you yo I don't
[56:21] know what y'all seeing so y'all forgive
[56:23] me if it's a freak show up here oh he
[56:26] would say that Jesus was the most
[56:27] anointed man that ever walked the face
[56:29] of the Earth so to think that same
[56:30] amount of anointing has been placed
[56:31] inside of you CH there is no shortage of
[56:33] the anointing there is no we are not
[56:35] wanting for the anointing but we are
[56:36] living in an overflow of the anointing
[56:38] of God we are living in the outpouring
[56:40] of the Holy Spirit we're living in an
[56:42] age where every devil has been Unleashed
[56:44] every sickness has been Unleashed every
[56:45] complex has been Unleashed every Power
[56:47] of hell has been Unleashed oh but fear
[56:49] not little bride every bit of word has
[56:51] been Unleashed every bit of power every
[56:53] bit of authority every bit of anointing
[56:55] has been Unleashed to the body of Jesus
[56:57] Christ I say there is enough anointing
[56:59] whatever you're going through there is
[57:00] enough anointing there is enough power
[57:03] there is enough Authority in this
[57:04] message to take you through whatever
[57:06] battle you're going through there is
[57:07] enough oil oh Hallelujah right now is
[57:10] not the time to live under your
[57:11] privileges now is not the time to live
[57:13] under the promises of God oh but it's
[57:15] the time to stand under the power of
[57:17] this word stand under the anointing and
[57:19] step into your position as a member of
[57:21] this bride body and say I will overcome
[57:24] because I'm anointed I will receive
[57:26] Victory because I am anointed I will
[57:28] defeat this devil because I am anointed
[57:31] I will live through this trial I will go
[57:33] through this storm why because I am
[57:36] anointed oh
[57:38] Hallelujah Joel
[57:41] 2:23 it say be glad then you children of
[57:44] Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[57:47] for he ha given you the former Reign
[57:48] moderately and he will cause to come
[57:50] down for you the former rain and the
[57:52] latter rain in the first month and the
[57:54] floor shall be full of wheat and the vat
[57:57] shall overflow with wine and oil so
[58:00] there will be an overflow of wine and an
[58:02] overflow of oil now the prophet he would
[58:05] expand on this oil and wine in the third
[58:06] seal and he would say that the oil
[58:08] represented uh the anointing of the Holy
[58:10] Spirit and that the wine represent the
[58:12] stimulation Revelation he would say the
[58:15] oil and the wine in the Bible is
[58:17] associated together always I got the
[58:19] concordance and I look there's a string
[58:21] of them like that where the wine and the
[58:22] oil goes together all the time see when
[58:25] the truth of a pro promised word of God
[58:26] has been truly revealed to his Saints
[58:29] that's filled with the oil or filled
[58:30] with the anointing they all get
[58:33] stimulated oh wine is a stimulation
[58:35] Glory I feel it right now stimulated
[58:37] with joy and Shout see and when it does
[58:40] it has the same effect upon them that
[58:42] wine does upon a natural man oh because
[58:44] when the Revelation has been given of a
[58:46] truth and the True Believer is filled
[58:48] with the oil or filled with the
[58:50] anointing the Revelation is revealed and
[58:52] the stimulation becomes so great it
[58:54] makes him behave himself
[58:56] unnormal oh my C why do y'all behave
[58:59] unnormal over there because when the
[59:00] Revelation is revealed do an anointed
[59:03] body do an anointed body I say there
[59:05] will be some stimulation that comes
[59:07] forth there will be some stimulation oh
[59:09] that comes forth from the body of Jesus
[59:11] Christ I say church when the Revelation
[59:13] when the spark of Revelation is the oil
[59:16] anointing placed inside of your heart
[59:18] there's going to be some stimulation
[59:20] there's going to be some excitement oh
[59:22] Hallelujah brother Brandon would say you
[59:24] might not jump in sh you might not
[59:26] oh some people are going to do that oh
[59:28] but there is going to be a stimulation
[59:29] either way there will always be an
[59:31] excitement there will always be just a
[59:33] just a bubbling forth of the word oh
[59:35] when that Revelation hits the anointing
[59:37] when the wine comes together with the
[59:39] oil oh I say there will be a
[59:41] stimulation hallelujah oh when I hear
[59:44] this word I get stimulated oh when I
[59:47] hear this message it stimulates me oh
[59:49] what do we do when we heard the
[59:50] revelation of the Seven Seals we got
[59:52] stimulated what do we do when this bride
[59:54] heard the revelation of adoption we got
[59:56] stimulated what do we do when we heard
[59:58] the seven Church changes I say we got
[1:00:00] stimulated why because a spark of
[1:00:02] Revelation came in contact with the
[1:00:05] anointing that was placed in the bride
[1:00:07] body of Jesus Christ and there was a
[1:00:09] stimulation that had to come forth oh
[1:00:12] Hallelujah I know what it means but when
[1:00:14] I was going through this I looked up the
[1:00:16] definition of the word stimulate oh and
[1:00:18] man reading the definition got me
[1:00:20] stimulated all right y'all got a second
[1:00:23] it means to revive to rekind
[1:00:26] to enliven to Quicken to light up to
[1:00:29] ramp up to fire up to juice up to
[1:00:33] vitalize to invigorate to jumpstart to
[1:00:36] power up to jol into ignition to
[1:00:39] energize into action okay what happens
[1:00:42] when anointing meets Revelation I'll
[1:00:44] tell you what happens we get stimulated
[1:00:47] we get invigorated we get vitalized we
[1:00:50] get Juiced up we get amped up we get
[1:00:52] powered up we get Jed into aition we get
[1:00:55] energized into action I say Church there
[1:00:58] is an anointing that's come in contact
[1:01:00] with the revelation of this word and we
[1:01:02] are a stimulated group of people oh when
[1:01:05] the definition was to rekindle oh maybe
[1:01:08] your Fire's a little low tonight maybe
[1:01:10] there's a fire that's a little low in
[1:01:11] your heart I'll tell you a place where
[1:01:13] there's some good old fashion Holy Ghost
[1:01:15] gasoline or that fire can get to burning
[1:01:17] again that flame can get to burning
[1:01:19] again oh Hallelujah we are a stimulated
[1:01:24] people oh it ain't a working up it ain't
[1:01:26] to build up it ain't just a motion oh
[1:01:29] Caleb you're acting like a Pentecostal
[1:01:30] no the Pentecostals act like
[1:01:33] me oh how can you say that I'll show you
[1:01:35] by the word I can say that oh they were
[1:01:37] started dancing for joy they started
[1:01:39] Shine for Joy at Zeus Street 1906 I was
[1:01:42] shouting for Joy before the foundation
[1:01:43] of the world in the presence of my king
[1:01:46] I say I was dancing before they were
[1:01:47] dancing I was shouting before they were
[1:01:49] shouting oh I was rejoicing long before
[1:01:51] they were rejoicing oh don't tell me
[1:01:54] I've got a denominational devil because
[1:01:56] I'm doing what I was created to do I say
[1:01:58] I'm GNA praise I'm going to Rejoice I'm
[1:02:01] going to praise my king because the
[1:02:03] anointing has come in contact with the
[1:02:05] revelation of this message oh and the
[1:02:07] word came forth and it struck thy seed
[1:02:10] and I can't help but get
[1:02:12] stimulated oh hallelujah oh watch it
[1:02:15] brother Caleb you're saying that you got
[1:02:16] to dance when the anointing comes no
[1:02:18] that's not what I'm saying that's not
[1:02:20] brother Brandon would purposely make
[1:02:21] sure that we did not think that he
[1:02:23] purposely made sure he was very careful
[1:02:25] and why people so tossed about he would
[1:02:27] say that so many times he said people
[1:02:29] misconstrue the anointing uh for emotion
[1:02:32] he would say people misunderstand and
[1:02:33] they misconstrue anointing to be emotion
[1:02:36] he said that that's what people will
[1:02:37] mistake it for but he would say the
[1:02:39] anointing is not emotion the anointing
[1:02:41] is supreme power in control oh but the
[1:02:44] cable what does that mean and the and
[1:02:45] the uncertain sound the priv will go
[1:02:47] through the supreme power and he would
[1:02:49] say that the way that the believer is
[1:02:51] filled with the supreme power is by
[1:02:54] faith in the perfect word of God he said
[1:02:56] when a Believer is filled has faith in
[1:02:58] the perfect word he said they are
[1:02:59] instilled oh with that supreme power oh
[1:03:03] and so God would not give a supreme
[1:03:05] power unto a group of people without
[1:03:06] giving them a way to control it just
[1:03:09] like we were talking about this morning
[1:03:11] brother Brandon would say the
[1:03:12] Pentecostals cannot have this power
[1:03:14] because he said they will be emptying
[1:03:15] out the hospitals all over the world
[1:03:16] they cannot control this power the world
[1:03:18] cannot control this power oh but it was
[1:03:20] not given for any people it was not
[1:03:21] given for a denomination it was not
[1:03:23] given for them oh but this word has been
[1:03:25] given to you this power has been given
[1:03:27] to you and it's been given to you
[1:03:29] through an anointing that could that
[1:03:31] could control that power that's why when
[1:03:33] brother Bron would have a prayer line if
[1:03:35] you listen to them on tapes you hear it
[1:03:37] all the time brother Bron He he'll say
[1:03:38] I'm waiting on the anointing I'm waiting
[1:03:40] on the anointing to come because the
[1:03:42] prophet of God knew that whenever that
[1:03:44] that anointing was the way that God
[1:03:45] would channel the power inside of the
[1:03:48] believer oh this power is not for the
[1:03:50] World Church oh this power was for the
[1:03:52] anointed bride this power has been for
[1:03:54] you in the day that you're living in oh
[1:03:56] do I get excited sometimes yeah I do
[1:03:57] I'll get a little joy in my victory oh
[1:03:59] but that anointing comes and that
[1:04:01] anointing is supreme power in control
[1:04:03] inside of the life of a Believer oh I
[1:04:06] say Church you need this anointing
[1:04:07] you've got to have this anointing
[1:04:09] because in order for that word to come
[1:04:10] forth in order for it to be manifested
[1:04:12] through you it can only be good it it
[1:04:14] can only happen through that channel of
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:17] anointing oh brother Brandon would say
[1:04:19] that the message he would say the
[1:04:21] anointing didn't bring dancing and
[1:04:22] shouting that stuff's all right I'm all
[1:04:24] for that and I went want you to know I
[1:04:26] mean you guys you guys see me I know a
[1:04:28] lot of you people know me I'm the
[1:04:30] biggest advocate for that in the world I
[1:04:31] love that I get excited more than just
[1:04:33] about anybody oh but the anointing is
[1:04:35] supreme power in control that's what the
[1:04:38] anointing is it's not a workup it's not
[1:04:39] a buildup it's not fing Goose The
[1:04:42] anointing is the channel through which
[1:04:43] the power of God is controlled in the
[1:04:45] body of Christ amen this bride church is
[1:04:48] in control oh this anointing church is
[1:04:51] what CS this bride in control I see this
[1:04:53] bride ain't blowing this way in the wind
[1:04:54] blowing that way in wind we ain't
[1:04:56] falling away after this we ain't running
[1:04:58] after this or running after that oh but
[1:04:59] I'm standing on a firm foundation I'm
[1:05:02] standing Church on an anointing that
[1:05:04] keeps me still it keeps me firm it keeps
[1:05:06] me solid in this message oh I say that
[1:05:09] anointing it places you in your position
[1:05:11] under the headship with the message of
[1:05:12] the hour and the anointing brings
[1:05:14] control of the power of God oh you say
[1:05:18] brother Caleb you don't understand we
[1:05:20] are on fire last week we were on fire
[1:05:21] but the church is going through a season
[1:05:23] right now yeah I understand church is
[1:05:24] going to go through seasons brother
[1:05:26] Braham said churches go through seasons
[1:05:27] and some people I feel like don't
[1:05:29] understand that churches go through
[1:05:31] Seasons oh and you know say well there's
[1:05:33] just some indifference in the church
[1:05:34] there's some family issues in the church
[1:05:35] going on right now I guess we've just
[1:05:37] lost that fire I guess the fire just
[1:05:38] ain't here no more he said but the C
[1:05:40] that's silly but that's the way that
[1:05:42] people think so many times is that
[1:05:43] because you're going through a season
[1:05:45] because a Believer is going through
[1:05:46] something means that the anointing ain't
[1:05:48] there and that's just not true brother
[1:05:49] brandham would go through Seasons he
[1:05:50] would say his church went through
[1:05:52] Seasons oh but I want you to read what
[1:05:54] the prophet says about this he said
[1:05:56] there's something within us a fire that
[1:05:57] is burning a life that has been lit by
[1:06:00] God and no breezes can blow it out
[1:06:02] there's no cold spells in the church
[1:06:04] there's no indifference amongst the
[1:06:06] people there's no persecution in the
[1:06:07] world that can blow out a flame that God
[1:06:10] has lit for as God's purpose is torch
[1:06:12] light of Freedom will burn until the
[1:06:14] coming of the Lord and no power can blow
[1:06:16] it out they will only make it burn
[1:06:18] brighter as they blow oh Hallelujah they
[1:06:22] tried to blow us out Church they tried
[1:06:24] to put us out in differences tried to

[1:06:29] us out Church problems family problems
[1:06:32] have tried to put us out oh but I say we
[1:06:34] only makes us burn brighter as they blow

[1:06:39] the world it can't be put out by Leia it
[1:06:42] can't be put up on any devil or with

[1:12:51] we're surrounded by demons they're
[1:12:53] trying to destroy this bride oh but I
[1:12:55] say we are going to overcome because
[1:12:57] that was an anointing that's been placed
[1:12:59] upon this
[1:13:00] bride
[1:13:03] hallelujah
[1:13:05] amen the prophet of God would say time
[1:13:07] and time again he would talk about David
[1:13:09] a lot and while Christ speak he would go
[1:13:11] through the anointing he would talk
[1:13:12] about David in several different places
[1:13:15] David knew he was anointed and was
[1:13:16] Vindicated to be a good shot he knowed
[1:13:19] he was a good shot David was anointed
[1:13:20] and he knowed it another place David
[1:13:23] know the anointing Lord was on him it
[1:13:25] didn't make him any difference he said
[1:13:27] the Philistines will be like the bear
[1:13:28] and the lion so here I come one more
[1:13:30] place he knowed where he was standing he
[1:13:32] was a man of Faith he believed God God
[1:13:34] was in him he knew that he was anointed
[1:13:37] oh Church there was power in knowing
[1:13:38] that you were anointed David didn't
[1:13:40] overcome because he was strong because
[1:13:43] he was strong he didn't overcome because
[1:13:44] he was a good shot he didn't overcome
[1:13:46] because he was educated he didn't
[1:13:47] overcome because he was just because of
[1:13:49] something he had learned oh but David
[1:13:51] overcame because he knew that he was
[1:13:53] anointed amen if he get ever get to that
[1:13:55] place night where you know that you were
[1:13:57] anointed brother B said if you get a
[1:13:58] revelation of who you are and what you
[1:14:00] can do you will be an invincible Army oh
[1:14:02] you'll be unstoppable undefeated
[1:14:04] unconquerable because you know that
[1:14:06] you're
[1:14:07] anointed amen saying that though to go
[1:14:10] to this area of thought David knew he
[1:14:12] was anointed brother Brandon would say
[1:14:14] or God himself would say David's a man
[1:14:15] after my own heart God would say that
[1:14:17] David was anointed to betray Christ and
[1:14:20] so now we want to skip ahead 300 years
[1:14:24] we're going to skip ahead five
[1:14:25] generations after this time and if you
[1:14:27] look over in 2 Kings 19 we ain't going
[1:14:29] to read it we ain't got time to go
[1:14:30] through it all but if you begin to read
[1:14:32] through the story here we are 300 years
[1:14:35] after David David's been dead 300 years
[1:14:37] we're five generations later and now
[1:14:40] Assyria has come up against Judah and
[1:14:41] King Jehoshaphat he was a Godly King and
[1:14:43] he consulted the man of God and he asked
[1:14:45] what we should do and in in 2 Kings 19
[1:14:48] the prophet would say thus sayith the
[1:14:50] Lord fear not I will give you victory
[1:14:52] for my servant David's sake and the
[1:14:55] Bible said that night that the spirit of
[1:14:57] the Lord went out and killed
[1:15:00] 185,000 Assyrians in one night oh you
[1:15:03] know brother malol I got a thinking
[1:15:04] about that oh the anointing that been
[1:15:06] placed upon David had so much power
[1:15:08] after 300 years that it could kill
[1:15:11] 185,000 Devils all in one night oh I
[1:15:14] begin to think of a 300y old anointing
[1:15:17] placed upon great great great grandpa
[1:15:19] had so much power that it could kill
[1:15:21] 185,000 Devils I say what about a
[1:15:24] fussing oting that's been placed upon
[1:15:26] the body of Jesus Christ oh I ain't
[1:15:28] using Grandpa's anointing I ain't using
[1:15:30] Daddy's anointing I ain't using some
[1:15:32] pastor's anointing or what I'm standing
[1:15:35] with the anointing of Jesus Christ oh
[1:15:37] and if a 300 year old anointing oh would
[1:15:39] able to kill 185,000 I'll say there is
[1:15:42] no limit or to what the anointing fresh
[1:15:45] anointing of the word poured out upon
[1:15:47] this Bride Can Do there's no limit to
[1:15:49] what it can accomplish There's No Limit
[1:15:51] Oh to the power that it has oh
[1:15:54] Hallelujah yeah oh is that enemy begin
[1:15:57] to come up Oh I thought it was amazing
[1:15:59] oh I imagine the Bible says that night
[1:16:01] the enemy went out oh I'm Not Just Be
[1:16:04] Imagined here but I like to imagine King
[1:16:06] Jehoshaphat slept really good that
[1:16:08] night oh I imagine that oh I imagine
[1:16:11] that he's been having some sleepless
[1:16:12] nights lately oh he knows Assyria is on
[1:16:14] its way he can't sleep Assyria is here
[1:16:17] he can't sleep Assyria is gathering
[1:16:18] ready to break through the walls he
[1:16:19] can't sleep oh but that now that King oh
[1:16:22] went to sleep to the sound of his enemy
[1:16:24] crying for for help oh that night jeos
[1:16:27] out went to sleep and he heard the pleas
[1:16:28] of his enemy as he heard the anointing
[1:16:31] slaughtering the enemy that had come up
[1:16:33] against him oh I want to put that devil
[1:16:35] on notice tonight morning is coming oh
[1:16:37] you might think you got power now you
[1:16:39] might think you've got Authority now you
[1:16:41] might think that you've got it you're
[1:16:43] over us now oh but I say the anointing
[1:16:45] is favors the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:16:48] mour is coming watch out devil morning
[1:16:51] is coming watch out complex morning is
[1:16:53] coming oh and when morning comes oh King
[1:16:56] Jehoshaphat said Israel do the spoil
[1:16:59] outside your Gates lay an entire Army of
[1:17:02] the enemy that stood against you oh I
[1:17:05] say tonight the anointing will fight for
[1:17:06] you the anointing will kill for you the
[1:17:09] anointing will stop every enemy that
[1:17:11] comes against you oh hallelujah oh that
[1:17:14] Prophet told Jehoshaphat he said stand
[1:17:16] still oh just praise he told him he said
[1:17:19] Just Praise he said Gather the musicians
[1:17:21] he said gather all the priests he said
[1:17:23] and y'all just praise and watch as the
[1:17:25] anointing Slaughters your enemy watch as
[1:17:27] the anointing Slaughters every devil
[1:17:29] that's come against you watch as the
[1:17:30] anointing fights for you oh
[1:17:34] hallelujah amen going back to the
[1:17:36] scripture we begin with Isaiah
[1:17:39] 10:24 it would say therefore thus sayith
[1:17:41] the Lord God of host oh my people that
[1:17:43] dwelleth in Zion be not afraid of the
[1:17:46] Assyrian he shall SMY with the rod and
[1:17:48] shall lift up a staff against thee after
[1:17:50] the manner of Egypt for yet a very
[1:17:52] little while and the indignation shall
[1:17:54] cease and my anger and their destruction
[1:17:57] and the Lord of Lord of host shall stir
[1:17:58] up a scourage for him according to the
[1:18:00] slaughter of Midian at the rock of
[1:18:03] orb now the slaughter of Midian at the
[1:18:05] rock of orb is referring to Gideon and
[1:18:08] the time in the Bible whenever three
[1:18:09] soldiers killed
[1:18:11] 135,000 midianites 300 soldiers 300 men
[1:18:15] completely destroyed the armies of
[1:18:16] Midian and so what what we see is that
[1:18:19] during this battle as they killed all
[1:18:20] these men and and so now once this
[1:18:23] happened the general of this Army the
[1:18:25] general of the army of the minites runs
[1:18:26] and he hides in the rock of Orab oh but
[1:18:29] I declare to you tonight when the day
[1:18:31] when God becomes your enemy there ain't
[1:18:32] no rock that can hold you there ain't no
[1:18:34] Fortress that can hold you there ain't
[1:18:36] no place you can go to hide when the
[1:18:37] anointing is out to kill you oh because
[1:18:39] whenever that whenever they those people
[1:18:41] had touched God's anointed oh that man
[1:18:43] he went and he hid in that rock oh but
[1:18:45] that anointing went out and but and this
[1:18:47] Bible is saying oh that the anointing
[1:18:49] went out and he slew that man at the
[1:18:52] rock of orb not only did the anointing
[1:18:54] slay your enemy oh but that man's name
[1:18:56] was Orab oh and so not only did he kill
[1:18:59] your enemy oh but God made oh and God
[1:19:02] made a declaration God wanted to make a
[1:19:04] monument oh what happened when an enemy
[1:19:07] messes with an anointed people I say
[1:19:09] tonight God made an example of your
[1:19:11] devil he hit him up he he he killed him
[1:19:14] in that rock oh and now that rock was
[1:19:16] named the rock of Ora oh to show us a
[1:19:19] monument hey this is what happens when
[1:19:21] an enemy comes against God's anointed
[1:19:24] this is what happen happens oh when the
[1:19:25] anoint when someone comes against the
[1:19:27] anointing oh of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:19:30] that anointing went out and killed them
[1:19:31] and now we see years and years later
[1:19:33] Israel or Isaiah is talking to the king
[1:19:36] of Judah and he's telling him look back
[1:19:38] to the rock of orb oh he's saying look
[1:19:40] back to the Rock oh not only did the
[1:19:42] devil kill oh the enemy that stood
[1:19:44] against God's people but he said I'm
[1:19:45] going to make a memorial of what happens
[1:19:48] when the anointing goes to battle and
[1:19:50] now all these years later Israel Isaiah
[1:19:52] standing there and he says okay fear not
[1:19:55] fear not this enem is against you fear
[1:19:57] not this that this enemy has come to
[1:19:59] your Gates oh look back to the rock of
[1:20:01] or oh I say tonight is a time of
[1:20:03] remembrance I say that we look back to
[1:20:05] the rock of or oh look back to what to
[1:20:08] the rock of pornography look back to the
[1:20:10] rock of complexes look back to the rock
[1:20:12] of bitterness look back to the rock of
[1:20:14] your past look back to what happened
[1:20:17] whenever an enemy tried to take you oh
[1:20:19] what the anointing said no look back to
[1:20:21] what happened oh when the enemy tried to
[1:20:23] kill you but the anointing said No I say
[1:20:26] God made an example of your devil
[1:20:28] tonight God made a God made a memorial
[1:20:32] of your enemy oh and I love this I was
[1:20:35] doing some research on the rock of orb
[1:20:37] and I thought it was so amazing one
[1:20:38] biblical historian wrote orb fell at a
[1:20:40] rock which became known afterwards as
[1:20:42] the rock of orb and this incident not
[1:20:45] only mocked a a Victorious turning point
[1:20:48] for the Israelites oh but it also
[1:20:50] devastatingly impacted the medanite
[1:20:53] influence in that region oh to the point
[1:20:55] where this is the last time in history
[1:20:58] where Midian was ever a threat to the
[1:21:00] nation of Israel oh I love that it said
[1:21:03] it not only was a turning point in
[1:21:05] Victory for Israel but it said it was
[1:21:07] the last time it marked the last time
[1:21:09] the minion was ever a threat to the
[1:21:11] nation of Israel oh you know what that
[1:21:13] means that means when Midian would try
[1:21:15] to creep in when the enemy would try to
[1:21:17] come back in again oh Israel would say
[1:21:19] before you do that why don't you go look
[1:21:21] to the rock of orb why don't you go look
[1:21:23] back do what happened the last time you
[1:21:25] said the anointing wasn't enough go back
[1:21:27] and look at what happened last time you
[1:21:29] tried to slay God's anointed oh church I
[1:21:32] say the anointing is here to fight for
[1:21:33] you the anointing is here to make a
[1:21:35] memorial of the devil that's come
[1:21:37] against you oh

[1:21:43] they will come tonight oh I say tonight
[1:21:46] Church fear not that the enemy has come
[1:21:48] against you there's an anointing in this

[1:21:59] for this message you were predestinated
[1:22:01] to take a hold of this word oh
[1:22:03] Hallelujah the prophet of God would talk
[1:22:05] about that duck that was born in the
[1:22:07] chicken
[1:22:08] yard and he would say that that farmer
[1:22:10] laid that duck or laid that egg into
[1:22:12] that chicken and that duck was born into
[1:22:14] this chicken yard oh but just because
[1:22:16] you're born into something doesn't mean
[1:22:18] that you were born for it oh Hallelujah

[1:22:23] bar would say is he said chicken pins
[1:22:25] are dry oh but that duck was made for
[1:22:27] that water and brother B said one day
[1:22:29] that duck was walking around that
[1:22:30] chicken yard and he said all it took was
[1:22:33] one whiff of that water he said there
[1:22:34] was a pond that had been there the
[1:22:36] entire time at the bottom of the hill Oh
[1:22:38] and the prophet of God said all it took
[1:22:39] was one whiff of that water and he said
[1:22:42] that duck shot over the fence and he
[1:22:44] shot down to that water oh Church you
[1:22:46] were made for that water that duck
[1:22:48] realized that he was made for that water

[1:22:53] he was made for that water and the
[1:22:55] second that he had an experience and
[1:22:57] came in contact with that water he shot
