[51:22] [Music]
[51:28] [Applause]
[51:39] amen you believe that this
[51:41] morning amen I'm so glad I serve a God
[51:44] that he's still there when you need him
[51:48] amen God bless yall this morning if you
[51:49] would stand your feet and we can't open
[51:52] up our Bibles we're going to begin in
[51:54] the Book of Genesis the fourth chapter
[51:56] in the 8th verse and then from there
[51:59] we're going to go to the book of Hebrews
[52:00] the 12th chapter beginning in the 23rd
[52:11] verse Lord Genesis the 4th chapter and
[52:14] verse 8 it says and Cain talked with
[52:17] Abel his brother and it came to pass
[52:19] that when they were in the field that
[52:21] Cain rose up against Abel his brother
[52:23] and slew him and the Lord said un Cain
[52:26] where is able thy brother and he said I
[52:28] know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he
[52:30] said what hast thou done the voice of
[52:33] thy brother's blood cth unto me from the
[52:35] ground now notice Abel didn't speak but
[52:37] it was the blood that spoke in in
[52:40] Hebrews the 12th chapter beginning in
[52:42] the 23rd verse it would read to the
[52:45] general assembly and to the Church of
[52:47] the firstborn which are written in
[52:48] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[52:51] to the spirit of just men made perfect
[52:53] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[52:55] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[52:57] and that word sprinkling there in the
[52:59] Hebrew would mean purification and to
[53:01] the blood of purification that speaketh
[53:03] better things than that of Abel brother
[53:06] Brandon would tell us many times that
[53:07] the blood of Christ speaks better things
[53:09] than that of Abel if I can I like take
[53:11] for a title this morning when the blood
[53:13] speaks okay before we go to the Lord in
[53:16] prayer I'd like to read this quote real
[53:17] quick where the prophet he said see Abel
[53:19] he was a righteous man he died he died
[53:21] innocent because he was in the way he
[53:23] was in the way standing for the real
[53:25] Revelation that he had had he spoke and
[53:27] it cried out the Justice blood of Abel
[53:30] cried out against Cain but the blood of
[53:32] Jesus Christ not only cried out but it
[53:34] redeemed amen it speaketh better things
[53:37] it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides
[53:39] you from the wrath of God see the blood
[53:41] of Abel could not hide can but the blood
[53:43] of Jesus can amen let's bow our heads
[53:46] this morning dear father Lord we come
[53:48] before you we lord we humbly and
[53:50] graciously come before you we thank you
[53:52] for giving us this opportunity to be
[53:53] here father together with Saints of like
[53:55] Precious faith and father Lord to be
[53:57] able to praise and be able to worship
[53:59] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ father
[54:01] Lord we thank you Father Lord and as we
[54:03] begin to Lord change the order of the
[54:05] service and go into the word I ask that
[54:06] you would just move this broken vessel
[54:08] aside and that you would just use me and
[54:09] that your word would come forth father
[54:11] Lord your unadulterated word would just
[54:13] speak through me and that you would Lord
[54:15] come and just meet the needs of the
[54:16] people father you know every need you
[54:17] know every heart you know every soul you
[54:19] know what they have need of and we're
[54:20] putting this service into thy hands you
[54:22] know all the needs father Lord that were
[54:23] put before the desk I ask you would just
[54:25] come and meet those father
[54:27] through is moving a mighty way today we
[54:29] put the service to your hands in the
[54:31] name of Jesus we pray
[54:33] amen be seated praise the Lord So In
[54:37] this passage of scripture here we're
[54:38] reading here in Genesis in 4:10 it says
[54:41] the voice of thy brother's blood cth
[54:43] unto me from the ground we know we
[54:45] understand that this scripture is the
[54:46] first time in history that the blood of
[54:48] man was ever shed it's the first time
[54:50] that the blood of Adam was ever spilled
[54:51] upon the ground and the prophet of God
[54:53] would tell us that blood has a voice
[54:55] blood always speaks when you begin to
[54:57] study probably the most universal fact
[54:58] that we know about blood something that
[55:00] Humanity has known about blood long
[55:01] before we ever knew anything else is
[55:03] that blood is essential for life and not
[55:06] only that but blood is one of the most
[55:07] complex and enriched substances that
[55:09] exist upon the face of the earth when
[55:10] you uh when you go to study it from a
[55:12] medical standpoint doctors they can
[55:14] examine an individual's blood and I'm
[55:16] sure just about everybody in here at
[55:17] some point in their life has been to the
[55:19] doctor and they've had they've had blood
[55:20] drawn and a doctor can examine an
[55:22] individual's blood and they can
[55:23] determine based on the type and the
[55:25] makeup of that blood they can determine
[55:27] the condition of the body that that
[55:29] blood was coursing through because all
[55:30] the power and all the nutrients and all
[55:32] the vitamins and all the strength and
[55:33] all the life that is contained in that
[55:35] body is contained inside of that blood
[55:37] and is distributed throughout the body
[55:39] through that blood in the courtroom
[55:41] anyone who knows are familiar with this
[55:43] setting knows that the blood speaks
[55:44] volumes the blood speaks louder than any
[55:46] witness the blood speaks louder than any
[55:48] other piece of evidence the witness
[55:49] could be Witnesses could be stacked up
[55:51] against somebody the evidence could be
[55:53] stacked up against somebody but when the
[55:54] blood test comes back when the blood
[55:55] results come back whatever the blood
[55:57] says it settles the case because the
[55:59] blood doesn't lie but the blood always
[56:00] speaks the truth and since 1989 DNA
[56:03] blood testing became available for the
[56:05] first time and since then 575 cases in
[56:08] the us alone have been overturned we're
[56:10] talking about convicted felons people
[56:12] who have spent over 20 years locked away
[56:14] in prison people have spent more than
[56:15] half their life some of them they've
[56:17] been locked away in bondage but we
[56:18] entered into an age change where the
[56:20] Revelation was revealed that that blood
[56:22] contained an identification property and
[56:24] that blood could identify who you were
[56:26] and it could speak for you when nobody
[56:28] else would and I just want to tell y'all
[56:29] this morning that there is an
[56:31] identifying bud that's going to speak
[56:32] for you when nobody else would amen we
[56:35] see in reading this verse it says the
[56:37] voice of thy brother's blood and you'll
[56:38] notice if you dive into the scripture
[56:40] that word voice there in the Hebrew
[56:41] doesn't mean a whisper it doesn't mean a
[56:43] quiet or a gentle sound but that word
[56:45] there in the strong concordance actually
[56:47] means a thundering Proclamation a loud
[56:49] cry a scream or a yell a thunder a sound
[56:52] and lastly that word voice here means an
[56:54] absolute the voice of to the blood is
[56:56] absolute it's an absolute voice it's an
[56:59] absolute sound and we know what an
[57:00] absolute means if something's absolute
[57:02] it means it's positive it's
[57:03] unquestionable it's undeniable it's
[57:04] irrevocable truth it's Undisputed so the
[57:07] blood can speak boldly it can speak
[57:09] clearly it can speak sharply because it
[57:11] is that has the voice of an absolute you
[57:13] ain't got to worry about whether the
[57:14] blood's going to lie you ain't got to
[57:15] worry about whether it's true or whether
[57:17] it's false you ain't got to worry about
[57:18] whether it's going to go to the left or
[57:20] whether it's going to go to the right
[57:21] but when the blood speaks is the voice
[57:23] of an absolute is the sound of an
[57:25] absolute and brother Bron would tell us
[57:27] in the Old Testament the blood
[57:28] represented sin and death all throughout
[57:30] the Old Testament the blood spoke of sin
[57:32] and it spoke of Sorrow it spoke of death
[57:33] it spoke of shame it spoke of the fall
[57:35] of mankind and today we see that the
[57:37] blood still speaks the blood never the
[57:40] blood never got quiet the blood never
[57:41] lost his voice what has changed is the
[57:43] message that the blood is speaking the
[57:45] prophet of God will say the blood now it
[57:47] speaks better things the blood of the
[57:49] second Adam speaks better things than
[57:50] the blood of the first Adam and for the
[57:52] first e that blood represented her fall
[57:54] that blood represented her shame that
[57:55] blood represent her mistake the blood
[57:58] represented the fall of mankind oh but
[58:00] there is another re that has rose up
[58:01] today that she will not turn down what
[58:04] the God has given her she will not but
[58:05] she will accept what the first Eve
[58:07] turned down because the blood no longer
[58:09] speaks against her but the blood now it
[58:11] speaks for her and I just want to say
[58:13] this morning the blood speaks for you
[58:15] amen the prophet said there goes the
[58:18] second Adam one brought death and here
[58:19] goes one bringing life here's the one
[58:21] who took life out of the world and
[58:23] here's the one who's bringing life back
[58:24] into the world the second Adam with his
[58:27] own blood hitting against his legs like
[58:28] that the Son of God going into Calvary
[58:31] to bear away our sins y that through the
[58:33] shedding of blood to perfect a man or a
[58:35] woman unconditionally I thought it was
[58:37] so powerful the contrast here of what
[58:39] the blood is speaking the blood now
[58:40] speaks better things and no longer
[58:42] speaks death and no longer speaks
[58:44] Justice and no longer speaks Vengeance
[58:46] but it now speaks power and now speaks
[58:48] restoration and now speaks Grace it
[58:50] speaks Mercy it speaks adoption it
[58:52] speaks Perfection it speaks for a bride
[58:54] that couldn't speak for herself is it
[58:57] spoke for a people that could not speak
[58:59] for themselves it doesn't only speak all
[59:01] these things but it speaks these things
[59:04] for you church maybe all the evidence is
[59:06] stacked up against you this morning
[59:07] maybe all the evidence is piled up
[59:09] against you maybe there's charge after
[59:10] charge piled up against you maybe he has
[59:12] penalty after penalty piled up against
[59:14] you maybe all the witnesses are piled up
[59:16] against you maybe all the evidence is
[59:17] piled up against you oh but no matter
[59:19] how many witnesses he has that say
[59:20] you're guilty no matter how much
[59:22] evidence he says that says you're guilty
[59:24] when the blood speaks when the blood is
[59:26] called to the stand the blood says
[59:28] you're free the blood says you're
[59:30] innocent the blood says I have paid the
[59:32] price the blood says I have paid the
[59:34] sacrifice the blood said I have bought
[59:36] you the blood said I bought Caleb the
[59:39] blood says I bought you and the blood
[59:41] says your bride the blood says your M oh
[59:44] I don't care how much evidence there is
[59:45] I don't care how many witnesses there is
[59:47] I don't care how strong the case of the
[59:49] prosecution is when the blood sea speaks
[59:51] it settles the case because the voice of
[59:54] the blood overcomes the voice of the
[59:55] prosecution the voice of the blood
[59:57] overcomes the voice of the enemy the
[59:59] voice of the blood overcomes the voice
[1:00:01] that says you're guilty it overcame the
[1:00:03] voice that said you've gone too far it
[1:00:05] overcame the voice that said there's no
[1:00:06] going back it overcame the voice that
[1:00:08] said you can never overcome it overcame
[1:00:10] that voice but there was another voice
[1:00:12] that rose up and it said I bought Caleb
[1:00:15] it said I bought brother Duren it said I
[1:00:17] bought Zion it said I bought brother
[1:00:19] wendle it says I have bought them with a
[1:00:21] price and I don't care what you say and
[1:00:23] I don't care what you say another voice
[1:00:25] from another the world I spoke up for
[1:00:27] them and that voice says they're free
[1:00:30] that voice is a sound of Freedom it's a
[1:00:32] sound of Deliverance it's a sound of
[1:00:33] Victory and that voice says I have paid
[1:00:36] their price oh when the blood speaks
[1:00:38] every other voice gets quiet when the
[1:00:40] blood speaks no other voice can can
[1:00:43] speak over it cuz when the blood speaks
[1:00:45] oh it's such an absolute it's a voice of
[1:00:47] an absolute the evidence speaks guilty
[1:00:50] the case say prison or the penalty speak
[1:00:52] death the prosecution speaks bondage but
[1:00:55] the blood speaks ictory the blood speaks
[1:00:57] Freedom the blood says you ain't got to
[1:00:59] live in that condition no more the blood
[1:01:01] says you ain't got to live under
[1:01:02] condemnation the blood says you can have
[1:01:05] forgiveness the blood says you can have
[1:01:07] your healing the blood says you can have
[1:01:09] your Redemption the blood says there's
[1:01:11] still enough for you Caleb there's still
[1:01:12] a drop of blood that can be dropped on
[1:01:14] you there's still enough there for you
[1:01:17] oh and if you're ever confused about
[1:01:18] what voice to listen to the evidence can
[1:01:20] lie the witnesses can lie oh the fast
[1:01:23] can lie the evidence can be forged the
[1:01:25] witnesses can be F paid off the facts
[1:01:27] can be Ted with but there was a blood
[1:01:29] flowing from emanuel's veins Hallelujah
[1:01:32] it can't be forced it can't be faked it
[1:01:35] can't be tampered with it can't be oh
[1:01:38] Hallelujah it can't be imitated it can't
[1:01:40] be replicated it can't be faked it can't
[1:01:42] be counterfeited he tried to imitate it
[1:01:45] he tried to replicate it he tried to
[1:01:47] fake it oh but there is nothing that
[1:01:48] compares to the voice of the blood
[1:01:51] there's nothing that compares to the
[1:01:53] voice of a word that called out for a
[1:01:55] bride there's nothing that compares oh
[1:01:58] hallelujah it's a voice of an

[1:09:55] again over one of these mornings the
[1:09:57] years of this baby eagle came in contact
[1:09:59] with a voice it was a voice from another
[1:10:01] world it was a voice I never heard
[1:10:04] before oh it was a sounding of Mama
[1:10:06] Eagle it was a sound of the Jubilee
[1:10:08] trumpet it was a sounding of a word that
[1:10:11] called out to a word bride oh church we
[1:10:14] ain't bunch of chickens in the chicken
[1:10:16] yard we ain't meant for the chicken yard
[1:10:18] but we were made to soar among the
[1:10:21] Eagles we were made to fly with M Eagle
[1:10:23] we were made to Screech with Mama Eagle
[1:10:25] we were made to scream with Mama Eagle
[1:10:29] oh man I heard that voice come and I
[1:10:31] looked around me where the voices
[1:10:32] normally come from I looked to my left
[1:10:35] there wasn't the voice wasn't coming
[1:10:36] from there I looked to my right the
[1:10:38] voice wasn't coming to there I walked
[1:10:39] back to the chicken house The Voice one
[1:10:41] coming from there over One Direction I
[1:10:43] had never looked there was another voice
[1:10:46] it was coming from another world it was
[1:10:48] coming from another dimension and that
[1:10:50] voice called out to me and it said Caleb
[1:10:52] you ain't meant to live in the chicken
[1:10:54] yard you ain't a chicken you ain't a
[1:10:56] Pentecostal chicken that just flutters
[1:10:57] your wings when you get excited but you
[1:10:59] are an eagle they can spread your wings

[1:11:07] Freedom
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:12] oh the Lord it says the blood speaks
[1:11:16] better things the blood is speaking than
[1:11:19] the blood has got a voice and the voice
[1:11:21] of the blood is the word hallelujah
[1:11:24] that's what makes it whether it's right
[1:11:25] or wrong the word is identified by the
[1:11:28] voice of the blood and the voice of the
[1:11:30] blood is the Holy Ghost and that brings
[1:11:33] life it is life and it brings life to
[1:11:35] the word and quickens it he said the
[1:11:38] voice of the blood is the word and the
[1:11:40] word is identified by the voice of the
[1:11:42] blood so here we see again the
[1:11:44] identification property that is laying
[1:11:46] down on the inside of this blood and
[1:11:48] another place here in the token the
[1:11:49] prophet would say the believer is
[1:11:51] identified by the blood so the voice of
[1:11:54] the blood is the word the word for our
[1:11:55] day is the message of the hour so the
[1:11:57] voice of the blood is the message of the
[1:11:59] hour the voice of the blood is the
[1:12:01] message the voice of the blood is
[1:12:03] Malachi 4 that is what the voice of the
[1:12:05] blood is it's the voice of a bride oh
[1:12:07] church I don't follow after this message
[1:12:09] oh just because it happened upon it one
[1:12:11] day and I thought it sounded good oh I
[1:12:13] don't follow this message because I just
[1:12:15] heard it one day I heard a preacher say
[1:12:17] it one day but no that's not why I
[1:12:19] follow this message when I heard I
[1:12:21] didn't hear the voice of William brandom

[1:12:24] Hill Billy oh I didn't hear the voice of
[1:12:27] just some good preacher but I heard the
[1:12:29] voice of the blood I heard the voice of
[1:12:32] the word I Heard a Voice that was
[1:12:34] calling out to me the Deep called into
[1:12:37] the deep the word called and it said
[1:12:39] Caleb your mind you can run as long as
[1:12:41] you want to you can just sit there as
[1:12:43] long as you want to you can live there

[1:13:14] it gets horse
[1:13:16] sometimes oh
[1:13:19] man he would say the blood speaks it
[1:13:22] speaks a better thing in the Old
[1:13:24] Testament the blood spoke of guilt in
[1:13:26] the New Testament it speaks of
[1:13:28] redemption in the Old Testament it
[1:13:30] speaks of death and of sorrow but in the
[1:13:32] New Testament it speaks of resurrection
[1:13:34] and of life it speaks of healing it
[1:13:36] speaks of Joy it speaks of power it
[1:13:39] speaks of life it speaks of Heaven and
[1:13:41] the same blood that was shed upon the
[1:13:43] ground that called out after his dead
[1:13:45] brother or called out after his brother
[1:13:47] that killed him the blood of Jesus
[1:13:49] Christ covers all of your sins and
[1:13:51] speaks peace and resurrection and power
[1:13:54] and life and healing and just in case he
[1:13:57] missed anything he said and all the
[1:13:59] Redemptive blessings that the blood was

[1:14:27] God required a token and this token was
[1:14:30] an innocent lamb that he had substituted
[1:14:32] for death in the Garden of Eden and now
[1:14:35] when the lamb was killed the blood was
[1:14:37] to be placed upon the doorpost and on
[1:14:39] the lentil and it was to show that the
[1:14:41] requirement had been carried out so the
[1:14:44] prophet he's teaching on this message in
[1:14:45] the beginning of the sermon you know he
[1:14:47] he goes through the death was was the
[1:14:49] price that was required of all Humanity
[1:14:52] death was required not just of the
[1:14:54] people in Egypt but that same death was
[1:14:56] required of the people that were there
[1:14:57] in Goan oh but he said you ain't got to
[1:15:00] pay that price the prophet at the
[1:15:02] beginning of the message would Define a
[1:15:03] token as a sign that the price has been
[1:15:06] paid oh and the token was not just the
[1:15:08] blood but it was the blood applied death
[1:15:11] would come knocking and the blood will
[1:15:13] say pass on by the price has been paid
[1:15:16] death will come knocking for your
[1:15:17] children and the blood will say pass on
[1:15:19] by the price has been paid it will come
[1:15:21] knocking for your family and the blood
[1:15:23] will say pass on by the price has been
[1:15:26] paid I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:15:28] you don't know the devil nothing you
[1:15:29] don't know death nothing you don't know
[1:15:31] that sickness nothing you don't know
[1:15:33] that complex nothing so just tell them
[1:15:35] devil pass on by the price has been paid
[1:15:38] pass on by the price has been paid I pay
[1:15:41] the sacrifice for Caleb I pay the
[1:15:43] sacrifice for Josh I pay the sacrifice
[1:15:46] for Kobe pass on my the price has been
[1:15:50] paid oh he would say the blood tonight
[1:15:54] is applied by simple Faith just not
[1:15:56] anything Supernatural but it's right
[1:15:58] around you everywhere just simply like a
[1:16:01] child reach out and grab a hold of it
[1:16:03] and apply the blood he said and this
[1:16:06] hiss up is just a simple childlike faith
[1:16:08] for the believer it isn't something out
[1:16:10] of your reach you don't have to reach
[1:16:12] very far to get it so the blood was
[1:16:14] applied through simple faith not some
[1:16:16] man-made theology not some complicated
[1:16:19] process not some intellectual system not
[1:16:21] some denominational organization not
[1:16:24] some s group of people who came up with
[1:16:26] a plan of how to get saved oh but no he
[1:16:29] said it's just applied through symbol
[1:16:30] faith and the privet would say it's not
[1:16:32] even Supernatural it's so simple it's
[1:16:35] not even Supernatural but it'll produce
[1:16:37] it Supernatural if you apply it but he
[1:16:39] said that blood was like the hiup and in
[1:16:41] the sermon he would explain that the
[1:16:43] hisb it was just it was a weed that
[1:16:45] would go everywhere throughout Goan it
[1:16:47] would just go everywhere and he was a
[1:16:49] perfect type because he said wherever
[1:16:51] the children of Israel were at whether
[1:16:53] they were at the mall whether they're at
[1:16:54] the store whether they're out at work
[1:16:56] wherever they were at they could just
[1:16:58] reach down and they could get on their
[1:17:00] knees and they could just take a hold of
[1:17:01] the hiss up right there where they were
[1:17:03] at it wasn't something they had to go to
[1:17:05] a priest for it wasn't something they
[1:17:06] had to go to a pope for it wasn't
[1:17:08] something they had to go to
[1:17:09] Jeffersonville for they could kneel down
[1:17:11] where they were at and they could just
[1:17:13] take up that faith and they could dip it
[1:17:15] in the blood and they could begin to
[1:17:17] apply the promises they could wave and
[1:17:19] begin to apply the promises they can
[1:17:21] apply the blood and just say get on back
[1:17:23] devil the blood has been applied get on
[1:17:26] back devil simple faith has applied the
[1:17:29] token oh speak for your family don't be
[1:17:32] afraid to speak for your family don't be
[1:17:34] afraid to speak for your children don't
[1:17:36] be afraid to speak for your spouse you
[1:17:38] can apply it over your household you can
[1:17:41] just apply the blood and just watch the
[1:17:43] blood speak for you oh when the death
[1:17:46] angel came when the death angel came by
[1:17:49] they didn't have to go out with clubs
[1:17:50] and stand there and say I'm going to
[1:17:52] kill you no they didn't have to do that
[1:17:54] why the Earth angel came and there was
[1:17:56] the blood and you know what they did
[1:17:58] they turned around and they walked the
[1:18:00] other way I tell you if you apply the
[1:18:02] blood Satan will walk up to you and
[1:18:03] he'll turn around he'll go the other way
[1:18:06] cuz he knows who you are he knows that
[1:18:08] there's been a blood token that's been
[1:18:10] applied over your life he can't touch
[1:18:12] you he can't give to you he can't hurt
[1:18:15] you oh you can accept your healing this
[1:18:17] morning accept your deliverance oh just
[1:18:19] step out on the blood just step out in
[1:18:22] simple faith and say I'm apply on the
[1:18:24] blood

[1:18:29] church it's not something hard if it was
[1:18:31] something hard I promise you I can do it
[1:18:34] but something
[1:18:35] easy and I was able to do it as a 17y
[1:18:38] old boy I was able to sit there oh in
[1:18:41] all my past the things I done the
[1:18:43] thoughts I'd had the things i' said the
[1:18:46] way I lived at 16 years old I was an
[1:18:48] atheist I went to church cuz mama and

[1:18:57] at 17 years old oh there was a change
[1:18:59] that happened inside my heart cuz one
[1:19:01] day I was running as hard as I could but
[1:19:04] no matter how hard I was running a drop
[1:19:06] of blood somehow managed to hit me in
[1:19:08] the back of the head no matter how much
[1:19:10] I tried to get away from it no matter
[1:19:12] how far I Tred to run the drop of blood
[1:19:14] still hit me oh and when that drop hit
[1:19:17] me I begin to shout I begin to dance I
[1:19:20] begin to praise oh I didn't know why at

[1:24:30] you know now notice no preacher had to
[1:24:33] go lay her hands on her nobody had to go
[1:24:35] and I pray for her but she said just

[1:33:45] can move because I've got it right and
[1:33:47] I've got oh I've got it right the blood
[1:33:50] says I can oh one of my favorite stories
[1:33:54] when the Titanic sank in
[1:33:56] 1912 one of my favorite stories that
[1:33:58] came out of it is there was a man by the
[1:34:00] name of Charles Joff and he was the head
[1:34:02] Baker on the ship you know as the ship
[1:34:05] began to sink the lifebts were filling
[1:34:07] up with children with women and
[1:34:09] everything and everybody was starting to
[1:34:10] panic the whole ship had just broke it
[1:34:12] was beginning to sink it was beginning
[1:34:13] to go under and everybody was oh
[1:34:16] everybody was screaming everybody was
[1:34:17] crying everybody around Charles was just
[1:34:19] running and jumping in the water and
[1:34:21] they jump in the water and they die
[1:34:22] within a matter of a minutes the water
[1:34:24] was so cold the water was so freezing
[1:34:26] the water was so deadly they died within
[1:34:29] a matter of minutes oh but Charles
[1:34:30] joffin began to move and he began to go
[1:34:33] to the liquor cabinet and he began to go
[1:34:35] open up those things and he grabbed all
[1:34:37] the liquor he could he grabbed all the
[1:34:39] wine he could and he wouldn't he jumped
[1:34:41] in that water just chugging away a
[1:34:43] liquor just chugging away a wine and he
[1:34:46] just drank all he could and The Story
[1:34:48] Goes that while everybody around him was
[1:34:51] dying everybody around him was screaming
[1:34:53] because of the they were in he said I
[1:34:55] not only survived but I was quite
[1:34:57] comfortable oh and I began to think
[1:34:59] about that story and I think of a
[1:35:01] natural wine of a natural alcohol could
[1:35:04] make a man completely forget his
[1:35:06] condition completely forget everything
[1:35:07] he was going through oh how much more
[1:35:10] can a new wine that's been given to her
[1:35:12] bride of Jesus Christ can it make us Run
[1:35:15] and Jump and overcome every obstacle the
[1:35:18] daily Waters won't hurt us the daily
[1:35:21] temperatures won't hurt us oh everybody
[1:35:23] around us is dying oh but we have had an
[1:35:26] alcohol inside of us oh and what alcohol
[1:35:29] does is it begins to thicken up the
[1:35:31] blood and alcohol increases that blood
[1:35:33] flow and what they said was that he
[1:35:35] drank so much alcohol that that blood
[1:35:37] was pumping so fast that that water
[1:35:40] would touch him and he couldn't even
[1:35:41] feel it oh death would touch him and he
[1:35:44] wouldn't even feel it oh death would
[1:35:46] touch him and it couldn't even feel it
[1:35:48] because that blood was ping so fast cuz
[1:35:51] he got so drunk that he couldn't didn't
[1:35:53] even feel it anymore oh church you can
[1:35:56] get so drunk on the word you can get so
[1:35:58] drunk on the word oh it'll all just go
[1:36:01] away you won't think about your problems
[1:36:03] you won't think about all you'll think
[1:36:05] about is the blood that is coursing
[1:36:07] through you oh Hallelujah why do I come
[1:36:11] to church on Sundays why do I come to
[1:36:13] church on Wednesdays I don't come cuz I
[1:36:15] was told to I don't come cuz I was
[1:36:17] raised too I've come cuz I found a place
[1:36:20] where I can get so drunk on the word I
[1:36:22] can just start my problems right out the
[1:36:24] door I can stomp Tuesday's problems
[1:36:27] right into the ground I found a place
[1:36:29] where I can get so drunk on the word
[1:36:32] that blood will begin coursing Through
[1:36:34] Me Oh Hallelujah when that Blood starts
[1:36:37] moving when blood starts speaking
