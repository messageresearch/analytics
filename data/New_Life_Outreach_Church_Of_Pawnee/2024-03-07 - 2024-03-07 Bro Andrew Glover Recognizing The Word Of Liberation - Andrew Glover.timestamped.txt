[57:44] pass in the process of time that the
[57:47] king of Egypt died and the children of
[57:49] Israel sighed by reason of the bondage
[57:52] and they cried and their cry came up

[57:59] you to notice they were not just crying
[58:01] in vain but their cry Was Heard and the
[58:04] Bible says God heard their groaning and
[58:06] God remembered his Covenant so when they
[58:09] begin to cry God begin to remember his
[58:11] Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and
[58:14] with Jacob and God looked upon the
[58:17] children of Israel and God had respect
[58:20] unto them another word for respect is
[58:23] favor so God had favor faor unto them
[58:26] now in the book of Hebrews the 4th
[58:28] chapter the book of Hebrews the 4th
[58:30] chapter I want to look at the 12th verse
[58:33] it's a very a very familiar scripture to
[58:35] us as Believers here tonight in Hebrews
[58:37] chapter 4 and verse number 12 Paul here
[58:42] writing in Hebrews 4 and12 and he says
[58:46] for the word of God is quick and
[58:49] Powerful somebody say powerful powerful
[58:52] and sharper than any two-edged sword and
[58:56] piercing even to the dividing aunder of
[58:59] Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[59:02] Morrow and is a discerner of the
[59:05] thoughts and intents of the heart amen
[59:08] the word of God is quick it is powerful
[59:11] sharper than any two-edged sword it is
[59:13] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[59:15] of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[59:17] Marrow and is a discerner of the
[59:20] thoughts and intents of the heart amen
[59:23] we ask the Lord this evening to add the
[59:25] blessing to the reading of his word as
[59:26] you can have your seats here this
[59:28] afternoon amen we thank the Lord for the
[59:30] reading of the word of God Amen I want
[59:33] you tonight by the help of the Lord for
[59:34] just a few moments on this opening night
[59:37] tonight if I would speak to you here I
[59:39] want to speak to you on recognizing the
[59:41] word of Liberation amen recognizing the
[59:44] word of Liberation when you look at that
[59:47] word Liberation it is the act of setting
[59:51] someone free from imprisonment from
[59:53] slavery or oppress ression it is to
[59:55] release it is freedom from limits on
[59:58] thoughts or behavior so when something
[1:00:01] is liberated it is liberating the way
[1:00:03] you think and it is liberating the way
[1:00:06] you act amen Liberation will release you
[1:00:09] from the limits of thought amen and
[1:00:11] Behavior now in 1947 the message the
[1:00:14] angel of God brother says this may every
[1:00:16] heart here be circumcised May the ears
[1:00:18] be circumcised to hear the word of God
[1:00:21] and circumcise the lips of the servant
[1:00:24] to speak that which is right and may
[1:00:26] great Powers be brought forth this
[1:00:28] afternoon in Liberation for the people
[1:00:31] may everyone that comes to the platform
[1:00:34] come with that one single mind this is
[1:00:36] my time and I shall be liberated this is
[1:00:40] my time and I shall be liberated if
[1:00:43] others are so can I amen amen I love
[1:00:47] that if others have been liberated amen
[1:00:49] that it was not just for one generation
[1:00:51] but it is for all generation amen so can
[1:00:54] and I may they not be silent but in the
[1:00:56] City walk the streets and Testify the
[1:00:58] next week giving praise and glory to God
[1:01:01] and may it start even in the merchants
[1:01:02] and all father until there is a Great
[1:01:05] Awakening here that they might know that
[1:01:07] the spirit of God still has the
[1:01:09] preeminence anywhere amen I want to say
[1:01:12] the spirit of God has the preeminence
[1:01:14] anywhere any place any time amen under
[1:01:18] any condition so we may not be in our
[1:01:20] home churches we may not be around our
[1:01:22] our normal friends but we're here to
[1:01:24] tonight and the same spirit that has the
[1:01:27] preeminence there has the preeminence
[1:01:29] here and he said and you can Pierce into
[1:01:31] the darkest places and pull amen those
[1:01:34] out who were crying amen the spirit of
[1:01:37] God can Pierce into the darkest of
[1:01:39] places and can pull those out who are
[1:01:42] crying now when you start talking about
[1:01:44] this you know that we're talking about
[1:01:45] the word right and the word amen is a
[1:01:49] Searcher Jeremiah 23:24 says can any
[1:01:52] hide himself in secret places amen that
[1:01:55] I shall not see him sayith the Lord do
[1:01:57] not I feel the Heaven and Earth sayeth
[1:01:59] the Lord in Amos 9 and3 the Bible said
[1:02:02] though they hide themselves in the top
[1:02:04] of caramel I will search and take them
[1:02:06] out fence and though they be hid from my
[1:02:09] sight in the bottom of the sea amen then
[1:02:12] will I command The Serpent and he shall
[1:02:14] bite them now watch this he's telling
[1:02:16] them that God is the Searcher amen and
[1:02:19] he knows where his children are amen as
[1:02:21] well as he knows where his children's
[1:02:23] enemies are amen and the enemies cannot
[1:02:25] hide no more than the child can hide
[1:02:28] amen a child can run from God but if his
[1:02:30] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:02:32] God is going to get a hold of him and
[1:02:35] he's going to claim him and change him
[1:02:37] for his purpose amen and the same devil
[1:02:39] amen that does not want you to fulfill
[1:02:41] your purpose amen that devil cannot hide
[1:02:44] from God either amen because God said if
[1:02:46] he goes to the Bottom of the Sea amen he
[1:02:49] will not defeat me I will move up on a
[1:02:51] serpent amen deide him in the bottom of
[1:02:54] the sea listen my God will not be
[1:02:56] defeated he is a deliverer he is a Savor
[1:02:59] amen he is a redeemer amen and his
[1:03:02] spirit is here tonight and he has the
[1:03:04] preeminence wherever his word has the
[1:03:06] preeminence he has their preeminence
[1:03:08] there Paul says he that searcheth a
[1:03:10] heart amen knoweth what is the mind of
[1:03:13] the spirit amen because he maketh
[1:03:15] intercession for the Saints according
[1:03:17] Amen to the will of God so we can all
[1:03:19] agree amen that the word liberates the
[1:03:22] church amen it's not the preach
[1:03:24] it's not the Deacon it's not the
[1:03:26] Evangelist it's not even the prophet
[1:03:28] amen it's the word that brings The
[1:03:30] Liberation on the church and the prophet
[1:03:32] said brother we ought to preach amen The
[1:03:35] Liberation from sin amen I think if
[1:03:38] there's ever been a time to declare amen
[1:03:40] that there's a generation that can live
[1:03:42] above unbelief they can live above doubt
[1:03:45] they can live above confusion amen I say
[1:03:47] now is the time to declare it amen cuz
[1:03:50] we have received the message of the hour
[1:03:52] and the message of the hour is more than
[1:03:54] a Doctrine amen it's more than a
[1:03:56] religion amen it is the word of
[1:03:58] Liberation and if that word finds
[1:04:00] preeminence in a meeting it'll Liberate
[1:04:03] the young it'll Liberate the old come on
[1:04:05] there ain't no devil can hide amen from
[1:04:07] the word of Liberation I believe we
[1:04:10] ought to preach the word of Liberation I
[1:04:12] believe we ought to pull on the word of
[1:04:14] Liberation now you know what that word
[1:04:16] pull means it means to exert Force Amen
[1:04:19] on someone or something amen so as to
[1:04:21] cause movement towards oneself it is an
[1:04:24] act of taking a hold of something and
[1:04:26] exerting Force to draw it toward one a
[1:04:29] force drawing someone or something into
[1:04:32] a particular direction amen or course of
[1:04:35] action can I say this we exert force on
[1:04:39] God Amen by crying out to
[1:04:41] him the way that we exert some force on
[1:04:45] God is we cry out to him as a Believer
[1:04:48] then we have a right Amen to pull on God
[1:04:51] Amen or to draw from God the desire of
[1:04:54] our heart brother said every True
[1:04:56] Believer is in the hand of God how many
[1:04:58] True Believers have we got and can and
[1:05:00] can DW from his love and his power and
[1:05:03] receive the full benefit amen of all
[1:05:06] that God is to the believer amen let me
[1:05:08] say this we're not just pulling on the
[1:05:11] word we're not just pulling and pulling
[1:05:13] and pulling amen but I believe we are
[1:05:15] pulling and receiving amen amen I
[1:05:17] believe we're pulling on the word of
[1:05:19] Liberation and we are receiving
[1:05:21] Liberation I believe we're pulling on
[1:05:23] the word of healing and we are receiving
[1:05:25] healing we are pulling on the Word of
[1:05:27] Deliverance and we are receiving
[1:05:29] Deliverance listen amen this is not a
[1:05:31] meet built upon a bunch of emotion amen
[1:05:34] it's built upon the word amen and the
[1:05:36] word alone and the reason why is because
[1:05:39] the word will defeat the Devil anywhere
[1:05:42] anytime any place under any condition if
[1:05:45] somebody will preach the word and
[1:05:47] somebody will pull on the word then the
[1:05:49] liberating spirit of God will come into
[1:05:52] the meeting and will liberate from the
[1:05:54] front to the back from the left to the
[1:05:56] right I believe it's time to get free
[1:05:58] again I believe it's time to let the
[1:06:00] word amen have its way in our lives and
[1:06:02] free us from Fear free us from doubt
[1:06:05] free us from confusion free us from
[1:06:07] skepticism free us from all kinds of
[1:06:09] unbelief and come back to the Liberty
[1:06:12] where in Christ has made us free amen I
[1:06:14] don't think we're just pulling I believe
[1:06:16] we're pulling and receiving and whatever
[1:06:18] we are drawing from God Amen is coming
[1:06:21] from an unseen resource amen and it's
[1:06:23] coming through Christ brother man
[1:06:25] preaches a beautiful sermon he calls it
[1:06:27] Awakening Jesus he said it must have
[1:06:29] been a hard day for him he was tired his
[1:06:32] body was worn out you know as he went
[1:06:34] along amen the people drew God out of
[1:06:37] him I love that the people drew God out
[1:06:41] of him they drew their desires from him
[1:06:45] now the Bible says in the beginning was
[1:06:46] the word
[1:06:48] right and the Word was with God and the
[1:06:51] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:06:54] and dwelt Among Us so when you saw Jesus
[1:06:57] you seen the Flesh of God when you saw
[1:07:00] Jesus all that was in God he poured into
[1:07:03] Jesus Christ so when you saw Jesus you
[1:07:06] were not just pulling up on the flesh
[1:07:09] amen that come from the womb of Mary
[1:07:11] amen CZ he was not a part of Mary she
[1:07:13] was only an incubator amen but you were
[1:07:16] pulling from the spirit amen and the
[1:07:18] spirit has the preeminence anywhere and
[1:07:21] the prophet of God said they drew their
[1:07:23] desires from him now I believe that our
[1:07:25] desires will be met in these meetings I
[1:07:27] don't believe we drove 14 15 five or six
[1:07:30] or however many hours to get here and
[1:07:32] just leave here without our desires I
[1:07:34] believe our God is in the building
[1:07:36] tonight amen to manifest our desires
[1:07:39] amen according to his will and his will
[1:07:42] is his word brother said God don't clown
[1:07:44] for people he's got a purpose of doing
[1:07:47] things amen God don't just do things at
[1:07:49] random or to please unbelievers amen but
[1:07:52] he works his will amen men to fulfill
[1:07:55] his promises amen when God begins to
[1:07:57] work he is not working according to the
[1:08:00] Motions of the crowd or according to the
[1:08:02] way somebody feels but he is working
[1:08:04] according to his purpose which is his
[1:08:06] will which is his word and listen
[1:08:09] friends there's nothing can defeat that
[1:08:11] word amen that word is a saving word
[1:08:14] that word is a Redeeming Word and if
[1:08:16] you'll begin to pull on that word you
[1:08:18] will exert force on God and he will come
[1:08:21] into this camp meeting this weekend he
[1:08:23] will tear the walls of Jericho down he
[1:08:25] will open up the Red Sea he will break
[1:08:28] the backbone of the devil he will shut
[1:08:30] the mouths of the Lions he's God and
[1:08:32] he's God alone and he can do what he
[1:08:34] wants when he wants how he wants because
[1:08:36] he's God and there's no God above him
[1:08:39] and there's no God beside him and
[1:08:41] there's no God with him my God is God
[1:08:44] and he's God
[1:08:46] Alone he's got everything I have need of
[1:08:49] I need Joy pull on him I need an answer
[1:08:52] pull on him I need a Vision pull on him
[1:08:55] I need direction pull on him he alone
[1:08:58] has the vision of Our Lives he is work
[1:09:02] his will to fulfill his promises 2
[1:09:04] Chronicles 15:15 the Bible said all
[1:09:07] Judah Rejoice at the oath for they had
[1:09:09] sworn with all their hearts and sought
[1:09:11] him with her whole desire and he was
[1:09:13] found of them I love what David said in
[1:09:16] Psalms 27:4 he said one thing have I
[1:09:20] desired one thing have I desired of the
[1:09:23] Lord and that will I seek after that I
[1:09:25] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:09:28] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:09:30] of the Lord and to inquire in his temple
[1:09:33] in Psalm 63:1 David again says oh God
[1:09:36] Thou Art my God and early will I seek
[1:09:39] thee my soul thirsteth for thee how many
[1:09:41] says that to me Lord my soul is
[1:09:43] thirsting for thee amen My Flesh longth
[1:09:46] for thee in a dry and thirsty land where
[1:09:49] no water is now here's what David wanted
[1:09:51] to see he wanted to see thy power amen
[1:09:54] and thy Glory he wanted to see the power
[1:09:57] of his word and the manifestation of the
[1:10:00] glory of his presence so as I have seen
[1:10:02] thee in the sanctuary in Isaiah 269 amen
[1:10:06] with My Soul have I desired thee in the
[1:10:08] night yay with my spirit Within Me will

[1:10:12] are in the earth amen the inhabitants of
[1:10:14] the world will learn amen righteousness

[1:10:26] listen why come all the way down here
[1:10:28] and have a meeting with our heart all
[1:10:30] closed up amen why try to hide things
[1:10:32] from God and hide things from the
[1:10:34] anointing and hide things from the
[1:10:36] spirit I think we ought to say on the
[1:10:38] first night God I'm opening up every
[1:10:40] door of my heart you walk in the door of
[1:10:42] private life you walk in the door of

[1:11:08] this word desire it is wish it is
[1:11:11] longing of one's heart it is the

[1:13:46] into the midst and there was little

[1:15:27] he's still serving God Amen because
[1:15:29] there is a Liberation in the power of
[1:15:32] the word of God if we'll just preach
[1:15:34] this message it'll liberate every home
[1:15:37] if we'll just preach this message it'll
[1:15:39] liberate every church if we'll just
[1:15:41] preach this message it'll liberate our
[1:15:43] young people it'll liberate our elders
[1:15:45] amen CU this message has come as the
[1:15:47] answer to the devil's question as the
[1:15:50] power of God under salvation listen
[1:15:52] we're not here just pulling pulling
[1:15:54] pulling we're receiving under the
[1:15:56] operation of the Holy Ghost the energy
[1:15:58] of God is in the building amen and we
[1:16:00] are believing that when people's Faith
[1:16:03] amen gets up to a place they will get
[1:16:05] the blessings to realize it's theirs
[1:16:08] then the same operation of the holy
[1:16:10] spirit will be operating in the church
[1:16:13] like it did back there can I say this as
[1:16:16] God reveals himself and we receive Faith
[1:16:19] by the revelation of himself we receive
[1:16:22] what we have needed
[1:16:23] of in other words the prophet said May
[1:16:26] Our Lives be so fitted with that word
[1:16:28] that the word will become flesh Among Us
[1:16:31] and will give the people Faith to draw
[1:16:33] from their account in heaven now do you
[1:16:35] all realize you got an account and it's
[1:16:38] not done with Wells Fargo and it's not
[1:16:40] with City Bank amen but you got an
[1:16:42] account in heaven and the prophet of God
[1:16:45] said which Jesus settled for them a long
[1:16:48] time ago for their sins and their
[1:16:50] sickness for their Journey now if you go
[1:16:53] on a journey am mean you can plan that
[1:16:55] Journey plan what you're going to do
[1:16:56] plan where you're going to stay plan how
[1:16:57] you're going to get there you can make
[1:16:59] all kinds of plans for the journey amen
[1:17:01] but the deciding factor on if the car is
[1:17:04] leaving the garage or not is is there
[1:17:06] enough money in the bank to make the
[1:17:08] trip out there and make the trip back
[1:17:10] amen so you got to start calculating
[1:17:12] numbers y'all know what I'm talking
[1:17:14] about amen trying to get everything
[1:17:16] together amen cuz you got to have enough
[1:17:17] funds to get where you're going and get
[1:17:19] back where you come from amen listen but
[1:17:22] when it come time for your journey amen
[1:17:24] God didn't put it in Wells Fargo he
[1:17:26] didn't put it in City Bank amen but that
[1:17:29] day on Calvary according to Isaiah 53
[1:17:32] Calvary was formed and there was an
[1:17:34] atonement made and there was a deposit
[1:17:37] put into every account for the sin of
[1:17:39] Our Lives for the sickness of our bodies
[1:17:42] listen we're not a bunch of poor
[1:17:43] peasants we are the sons and daughters
[1:17:45] of God under the Dominion of a king and
[1:17:48] he owns the cattle on the Thousand Hill
[1:17:50] listen he didn't save you to lose you he
[1:17:52] didn't didn't find you to lose you he
[1:17:54] didn't teach you to swim to let you
[1:17:55] drown but he called you and he chose you
[1:17:59] and he sustained you and he anointed you
[1:18:01] for a Time such as this listen you got
[1:18:04] the checkbook C the
[1:18:06] check I said you got the checkbook it's
[1:18:09] time to write the check everything you
[1:18:11] need in this journey amen is in your
[1:18:13] account tonight can I say this to you it

[1:18:19] it was not deposited amen the day the
[1:18:21] doctor said there was something on the
[1:18:23] scan it was not deposited amen the hour
[1:18:26] that you heard about the message but
[1:18:28] before the foundation of the world there
[1:18:30] was a predestinated seed that was
[1:18:33] deposited on the inside of your soul and
[1:18:36] that is your right to every Redemptive
[1:18:38] blessing you are not a serpent seed you
[1:18:41] are a son and a daughter of the most
[1:18:44] high God if anybody got a right to
[1:18:46] believe for the impossible you got a
[1:18:48] right to believe if anybody got a right
[1:18:51] to preach the unsearchable Riches of
[1:18:53] Christ we got a right to preach it
[1:18:55] brother because we are a part of
[1:18:58] Heaven's bank
[1:18:59] account there's healing in the account
[1:19:02] there's joy in the account there's
[1:19:04] victory in the account there's power in
[1:19:06] the account there's miracles in the
[1:19:08] account there's a power of the Holy
[1:19:10] Ghost in the account won't you draw from
[1:19:13] it tonight w't you draw from your
[1:19:15] account you need healing get it out of
[1:19:18] the bank you need salvation get it out
[1:19:21] of the bank it's already in
[1:19:27] there I didn't put it there God put it
[1:19:30] there Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our
[1:19:34] transgression he was bruised for our
[1:19:36] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:19:39] was upon him and with his stripes we
[1:19:43] were healed brother BR said like this
[1:19:46] brother wend all in the same day by the
[1:19:49] same
[1:19:50] man come on Church all in the same day
[1:19:54] brother Nathaniel by the same man so
[1:19:56] there is no question on is there
[1:19:58] insufficient funds amen he didn't give
[1:20:01] it to three different gods and say
[1:20:03] deposit this in Katie's account he
[1:20:05] didn't give it to three different gods
[1:20:06] and say deposit in Mah's account amen
[1:20:09] but the same day he died was the same
[1:20:11] day that he deposited
[1:20:14] everything Hallelujah was the same day
[1:20:17] he deposited everything that you would
[1:20:19] have need of for this journey here proba
[1:20:22] God said Inseparable it runs parallel
[1:20:25] one to the other he said the blood was
[1:20:27] coming from his back and the blood
[1:20:29] coming from his wound he said now watch
[1:20:31] now think about this young people the
[1:20:33] blood was coming from his back and then
[1:20:35] there was blood coming from his side he
[1:20:37] said but watch it all mixed together and
[1:20:40] run off of his
[1:20:41] feet I ain't got time to preach here for
[1:20:44] an hour it all mixed together and where
[1:20:46] did it run off of his feet and what is
[1:20:49] the foot a sign of it is a sign of
[1:20:51] judgment so when the blood from his back
[1:20:54] amen run down the side and the blood
[1:20:56] from his side met the blood from his
[1:20:58] back the blood for your healing and the
[1:21:00] blood for your salvation met together
[1:21:03] and they met on his feet so that means
[1:21:05] he's already judged your sin he's
[1:21:08] already judged your sickness he's
[1:21:10] already judged everything that the devil
[1:21:12] would try to hold against you I might as
[1:21:14] well say it you're free tonight by the
[1:21:17] blood of Jesus Christ and the power of
[1:21:19] the Holy Ghost I think it's high time to

[1:21:24] by the word of Liberation the blood has
[1:21:27] Set Me Free I'm free from sickness I'm

[1:22:12] of this Earthly Journey was met in
[1:22:15] Calvary even the Rapture is right in you

[1:22:22] you there's something
[1:22:25] calling because it's in you there's
[1:22:29] something calling now watch a prophet
[1:22:31] and things that are to be he said

[1:22:34] somebody say calls to live and there's
[1:22:37] something in us that calls to do right
[1:22:40] he said then God will call somebody on
[1:22:42] the platform or the pit that will preach
[1:22:45] the absolute truth why because it shows
[1:22:48] then if you're a real child of God you
[1:22:51] begin to cry out out so when the word of
[1:22:54] Liberation comes into the building amen
[1:22:57] and begins to be preached amen if you
[1:22:59] are a real child of that word then
[1:23:01] something in you begins to cry out in
[1:23:03] other words it's call and
[1:23:07] response I'm getting in another sermon
[1:23:09] here amen but let me say like this the

[1:25:11] recognizes that it's more than just a
[1:25:13] spit and sweating preacher but it's the

[1:27:28] the building and begins to manifest
[1:27:31] itself in power and deliverance I say
[1:27:34] the devil don't like it but we love it
[1:27:36] we're going to say what a prophet said
[1:27:37] until ever devil is defeated I want to
[1:27:40] go on record I stand with this message I
[1:27:43] stand with William Brandon I stand with
[1:27:45] what he taught on every subject from 37
[1:27:47] to 65 from Genesis to Revelation when it
[1:27:50] looks like it's his opinion I still
[1:27:52] stand with him because the pillar of
[1:27:55] fire stood with him and if the pillar of
[1:27:57] fire stood with him you better believe
[1:27:59] this old country boy or stand with him
[1:28:01] cuz whatever he said got backed up
[1:28:04] whatever he preached the angel amen and
[1:28:06] that same Angel is in this building
[1:28:08] tonight so we stand with the message of
[1:28:11] the hour this Youth Camp stands with the
[1:28:14] message of the
[1:28:15] hour we don't stand with your ideas we
[1:28:18] don't stand with your opinions but we
[1:28:20] stand with the say Lord through the
[1:28:23] seventh Angels
[1:28:25] message because it's the
[1:28:28] truth I said it's the
[1:28:32] truth I think that devil got out of here
[1:28:36] it's the
[1:28:37] truth you shall know the truth and the
[1:28:40] truth shall make you free I want you to
[1:28:42] remember that the word
[1:28:46] make it's only showing what's coming
[1:28:48] this week in the spiritual if the son
[1:28:50] therefore shall make make you free ye
[1:28:53] shall be free indeed look at this word
[1:28:56] make to set at Liberty are you ready for
[1:28:59] this from the Dominion of sin now
[1:29:02] brother ask a very simple question you
[1:29:04] know what he says he said what is the
[1:29:07] truth now there's a lot of people got a
[1:29:09] lot of answers but brother brandham
[1:29:11] answered it so let's just say what he
[1:29:13] said okay and he said Thy word is the
[1:29:16] truth brother said Janice and jambers
[1:29:19] whed Moses remember that and the Bible
[1:29:21] said as they stood Moses in the last
[1:29:23] days they would reappear those Spirits
[1:29:25] again now when are those Spirits going
[1:29:27] to reappear just before the liberation
[1:29:30] of the people he said Hallelujah The
[1:29:34] Liberation time is
[1:29:36] here so when you see Janice and jambers
[1:29:39] appear again to withstand Moses you can
[1:29:43] automatically look and say the hour of
[1:29:46] Liberation is here the protag God said
[1:29:48] see why because if you believe in the
[1:29:50] truth then the truth will will always
[1:29:52] speak for itself you never have to
[1:29:54] strain
[1:29:56] truth are you ready for this truth will
[1:29:59] always be truth can I say this this
[1:30:02] message is the truth regardless of what
[1:30:05] anybody says anybody thinks anybody
[1:30:08] interprets this message is the truth now
[1:30:12] can I go on and say this it's the truth
[1:30:14] on the mountain it's the truth in the
[1:30:17] valley it's the truth in the hospital
[1:30:19] it's the truth in the church it's the
[1:30:21] truth Truth at school it's the truth at
[1:30:23] Youth Camp wherever this message is it's
[1:30:26] the
[1:30:28] truth you can put it in a jail and it's
[1:30:30] the truth you can put it in the pits of
[1:30:32] hell and it's still the truth because
[1:30:35] truth never changes ah Hallelujah he
[1:30:39] said I wish to preach the truth he said
[1:30:41] the truth will never make you popular
[1:30:43] but the truth will make you honest and
[1:30:44] I'd rather be honest and popular because
[1:30:47] why let me just go brother W can I
[1:30:49] preach the message of the hour is the
[1:30:52] absolute
[1:30:55] period period
[1:30:59] the might as well preach the message of
[1:31:03] the hour is the absolute
[1:31:07] period you said you're getting out there
[1:31:09] it's the absolute truth so how can
[1:31:12] something be the truth and not be the
[1:31:15] absolute I know oh God he say oh the
[1:31:18] message is the truth but brother B
[1:31:20] missed it here brother said something no
[1:31:22] you don't believe it's the truth because
[1:31:24] if the message is the truth then it's
[1:31:26] absolute truth and absolute means it's
[1:31:29] Unlimited in its power come on church
[1:31:32] it's not checked it
[1:31:34] checks you don't check this message this

[1:31:50] message by our lives well I think it's
[1:31:52] okay to go here and I think it's okay to
[1:31:54] wear this and I think it's okay to
[1:31:56] listen that amen but I believe the
[1:31:57] message is the truth no you don't
[1:31:59] because you're reducing the power of the
[1:32:01] message to change every aspect of your
[1:32:04] life let me say this if this message
[1:32:06] can't change your dress and it can't
[1:32:08] change the music and it can't change the
[1:32:10] places you go and the things you look at
[1:32:13] how in God's name is it going to change
[1:32:14] your body but I believe this is a
[1:32:16] changing message I believe it changes
[1:32:19] habits I believe it changes nature I
[1:32:21] believe it changes attitudes I believe
[1:32:23] it changes dress I believe it changes
[1:32:26] clothes I believe it changes music and
[1:32:28] one of these days it's going to change
[1:32:31] my body in the moment in the twinking of
[1:32:33] an eye if it liberated me
[1:32:37] here if it liberated my soul what's it
[1:32:40] going to do to my body some
[1:32:44] morning God oh
[1:32:47] Merc I'm just going to preach young
[1:32:49] people they say well brother brother B
[1:32:51] preached some truth no he preached all
[1:32:54] truth brother B said God would let me
[1:32:56] tell you part truth and not the rest of
[1:32:59] it truth he wouldn't stand for that God
[1:33:03] is all truth brother said now watch his
[1:33:06] truth and his love and attitude is that
[1:33:08] it's the same towards you as it is to
[1:33:11] another believer before you so when you
[1:33:15] come on the scene God didn't change his
[1:33:17] attitude concerning you but he's got the
[1:33:20] same attitude toward
[1:33:22] you as he did to those before
[1:33:25] you watch this if God can heal one
[1:33:27] person with cancer he can heal every one
[1:33:29] of you with cancer he has healed every
[1:33:32] one of you that's got cancer the only
[1:33:34] thing you have to do is just accept it
[1:33:37] and I'm just just servant here in
[1:33:38] Vindication that he through Grace might
[1:33:40] come down on me and speak through this
[1:33:42] channel to vindicate his presence with
[1:33:45] you are y'all ready for this he isn't
[1:33:48] dead he isn't in a grave and need
[1:33:51] neither is he on the cross come on he's
[1:33:54] not in a Manger he's not as a boy in the
[1:33:57] carpenter shop he's not in Gethsemane
[1:34:00] tonight he's not on his way to gotha
[1:34:02] he's not on Mount Calvary he's not in
[1:34:05] the Tomb in Jerusalem can I go ahead and
[1:34:07] say it he's not even in the pits of Hell
[1:34:09] tonight taking the keys of death hell
[1:34:11] and the grave away from the devil but my
[1:34:13] God tonight has ascended but he's
[1:34:16] descended Amen to the right hand of the
[1:34:18] father and he sits there in power and
[1:34:21] authority tonight over every devil over
[1:34:24] every Spirit listen my God is not a weak
[1:34:27] God he's a mighty God he's a powerful
[1:34:31] God he's a moving God he's a god of his
[1:34:35] word and watch the spirit comes to the
[1:34:38] word I love what the prophet of God said
[1:34:40] he said look at John 16:13 how be it
[1:34:43] when he the spirit of Truth has come he
[1:34:45] will guide you into all truth he'll not
[1:34:47] speak of himself but whatsoever he says
[1:34:50] he shall hear and he shall speak now
[1:34:52] watch he will show you things to come
[1:34:54] can we say this together the spirit of
[1:34:57] Truth is
[1:34:59] come the spirit of truth of Truth is
[1:35:03] come it's not coming or has been here
[1:35:08] he's
[1:35:10] here the spirit of Truth is come now
[1:35:13] look at this word come it is from one
[1:35:16] place to another and it is used of both
[1:35:18] persons arriving it means to appear I
[1:35:20] love this it means to come forth it
[1:35:23] means to show itself to find a place of
[1:35:27] influence so when he the spirit of Truth
[1:35:30] has come now watch this the spirit
[1:35:33] always comes to the word so when he the
[1:35:36] spirit of Truth is come where will he
[1:35:38] come he will not come to my feelings he
[1:35:40] will not come to my traditions he will
[1:35:43] come to the word and then the word will
[1:35:46] find an influence among the Believers of
[1:35:48] that word can I say this we're not under
[1:35:51] man's influence we're not under a
[1:35:53] Church's influence we're not under a
[1:35:55] little group of people's influence we
[1:35:57] have Arisen to the top of Mount sign and
[1:36:00] we are under the influence of the spirit
[1:36:02] of
[1:36:04] Truth are you with me we're under the
[1:36:06] influence of the spirit of truth then
[1:36:08] whatever we say is coming from the
[1:36:10] vision whatever we preach is coming from
[1:36:12] the message because the message of the
[1:36:14] hour amen is the only thing that will
[1:36:17] break the strength of the devil let me
[1:36:19] say what the pr of God said now let me
[1:36:21] let me just back up here and say this
[1:36:23] Satan don't want the spirit of Truth
[1:36:26] preached and he don't want you to hear
[1:36:28] it but another thing he don't want you
[1:36:30] to do is he don't want you to pull on it
[1:36:32] because there is a reason why and the pr
[1:36:34] of God said thou oh God has come into
[1:36:37] the midst of the people and their faith
[1:36:40] has drawn out Supernatural words
[1:36:43] explaining to them their life of what
[1:36:45] they have done what they must do and
[1:36:48] what will be so we are under the
[1:36:50] influence of the spirit of truth that
[1:36:53] knows what has
[1:36:54] been he knows what is and he also knows
[1:36:58] what will be so we're not serving a God
[1:37:01] that can only see one section of time in
[1:37:03] other words we're not serving a god that
[1:37:06] is looking at you the way he's looking
[1:37:08] at your past he's oh God he's not
[1:37:11] looking at you as if he's looking at
[1:37:13] your past if you're past is underneath
[1:37:16] the blood he does not see your past when
[1:37:20] he looks at you the only thing he sees
[1:37:22] is the
[1:37:23] blood so God can see your past but he
[1:37:27] can also see your present so he's
[1:37:29] looking at you but he's not looking at
[1:37:31] you just in your present can I tell you
[1:37:34] why because he's the spirit of Truth and
[1:37:37] he's come out of your future come on
[1:37:40] Church he's come out of your future and
[1:37:43] has walked into your present as the
[1:37:45] defeater of your past as the danger of
[1:37:48] your present to introduce you to your
[1:37:50] future
[1:37:51] church and living God if you can ever
[1:37:54] see what this message is it is an
[1:37:56] unlimited it is a finite message if
[1:37:59] we'll just take the limits off of God
[1:38:01] you'll hear these words you never even
[1:38:04] done it in the first place if you'll
[1:38:06] take the limits off of God you'll hear
[1:38:08] these words that day on Calvary every
[1:38:11] sin was kettled every sickness was
[1:38:13] healed if you'll just hear the spirit of
[1:38:16] Truth you know what he'll say he'll say
[1:38:18] I seen you over
[1:38:20] there
[1:38:21] oh come on church and you know who's
[1:38:24] doing that not me that's you the part of
[1:38:27] God said the people pulling you people's
[1:38:29] the one I have not one thing to do with
[1:38:30] it it's just the gift of God that I
[1:38:32] yield myself to and you draw from it
[1:38:34] yourself you out there in the meetings
[1:38:36] you can sit and begin to pray to God and
[1:38:39] watch him turn right around and say
[1:38:41] something to you and tell you what you
[1:38:44] was praying about and what you ask for
[1:38:47] other day a young sister told me she
[1:38:49] said brother Andrew you just preaching a
[1:38:50] meeting in the church the other day and
[1:38:51] said you were talking about the you were
[1:38:53] talking about the Lord and and how
[1:38:54] there's a future and she said in my
[1:38:56] heart I said Lord I got some questions
[1:38:59] about the future home she said brother
[1:39:00] Ander no more than when you said that
[1:39:02] she said you turned and looked at me and
[1:39:04] said now the Lord can answer those
[1:39:06] questions about the future home I didn't
[1:39:08] know her questions but listen there's an
[1:39:11] unseen Force are you hearing me come on
[1:39:14] are oh you said that's spooky that's not
[1:39:17] spooky that's Supernatural and the
[1:39:19] supernatural transcends the natural
[1:39:21] listen we got to get out of this natural
[1:39:23] Services come on we come on might as
[1:39:26] well preach amen we got so settled down
[1:39:28] and so spooky that anything that comes
[1:39:30] along now we're PL scared to death and
[1:39:32] before long if we're not careful every
[1:39:34] Supernatural manifestation is going to
[1:39:37] scare us until we ain't nothing but a
[1:39:38] bunch of dead Church of Christ amen
[1:39:40] sitting around talking about God moving
[1:39:42] in brother bram's days but I come here
[1:39:44] to tell you tonight amen there is a yum
[1:39:47] and it's the word of God it's the
[1:39:49] message of the hour and we ought to
[1:39:50] check every visitation we ought to check
[1:39:53] every dream we ought to check every
[1:39:54] Vision we ought to check every sermon we
[1:39:57] ought to check everything by the message
[1:39:59] of the hour and if it passes the message
[1:40:02] we ought to hold it up before the people
[1:40:04] and say the shout of the king is in the
[1:40:07] camp but if it's against the word amen
[1:40:09] repent of the thing Let It Go and move
[1:40:12] on for the glory of
[1:40:14] God I don't think we ought to make our
[1:40:16] churches natural because of scarecrows
[1:40:19] scarecrows will always be here but his
[1:40:21] brother Donnie Reagan says scarecrows
[1:40:23] they don't scare crow they scarecrows
[1:40:25] but they don't scare Eagles and last
[1:40:27] time I checked I'm not a crow I am an
[1:40:30] eagle I got Eagle DNA I got eagle
[1:40:33] feathers I got eagle eyes I got an eagle
[1:40:36] message I'm under an eagle anointing I
[1:40:38] refuse to be bound down to some chicken
[1:40:42] mentality we're Eagles we're Eagles
[1:40:46] Carter spread your wings as an eagle and
[1:40:49] remember who you are
[1:40:53] oh Satan don't want this message
[1:40:55] preached because when that word comes in
[1:40:57] the church he says now what something's
[1:40:59] fixing to happen cuz there's the word
[1:41:02] there's the promise and the power the
[1:41:05] word the promise and the power to sling
[1:41:09] it that's what we need today is a man
[1:41:13] that'll take God's word with the power
[1:41:16] of the Holy Ghost behind him to press it
[1:41:19] out there
[1:41:22] and watch it come to
[1:41:26] pass I don't think he's talking about
[1:41:28] something way off in the future I think
[1:41:30] he's talking about this day press the
[1:41:33] word out there and watch it come to pass
[1:41:36] can I say this that's God's Army we're
[1:41:39] soldiers here tonight in the army of the
[1:41:42] Living God now I want I want to break
[1:41:44] into something here in Revelation one
[1:41:46] you will read there about the Sevenfold
[1:41:48] personage of Christ go read it when you
[1:41:50] get time in Hebrews 4:12 the Bible says
[1:41:53] for the word of God is quick it is
[1:41:55] powerful and it is sharper than any
[1:41:57] two-edged sword it is piercing even to
[1:42:00] the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit
[1:42:03] of the joints and Marrow and is a
[1:42:05] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:42:09] the
[1:42:10] heart in Revelation 1:16 and he had in
[1:42:13] his right hand Seven Stars and out of
[1:42:16] his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword
[1:42:19] his countenance was as the son Amen
[1:42:21] shineth in his strength brother picks
[1:42:24] this up in the patmas vision and he said
[1:42:26] it is the word it is performing where
[1:42:29] unto it was sent for it is the word is
[1:42:32] full of
[1:42:35] power the word is full of
[1:42:39] power somebody say well we ain't going
[1:42:41] to be a word only church well I agree
[1:42:43] that there's spirit and word but if the
[1:42:45] word is full of power then what you're
[1:42:47] saying is you ain't going to be a power
[1:42:48] only
[1:42:49] church
[1:42:51] come on Church there's power in the word
[1:42:55] have we let the devil so back us up in a
[1:42:57] corner that we got to have some feeling
[1:42:59] or some gift or some sensation Amen to
[1:43:02] move us to the promises of God I say God
[1:43:04] forbid if the devil ever put us back in
[1:43:07] some Pentecostal confusion we are the BL
[1:43:10] of Jesus Christ Anointed with a pillar
[1:43:12] of fire we believe in the manifestation
[1:43:15] of God we believe in the power of God
[1:43:17] coming in the church by the word William
[1:43:20] brandom said the the seventh angel will
[1:43:21] turn our hearts back to the word and I
[1:43:24] say thank God we are a word church with
[1:43:27] a word anointing with a word presence
[1:43:30] because the word of God is the truth
[1:43:32] wherever you put
[1:43:35] it it's the word full of power it is the
[1:43:38] same spirit that was in Jesus the word
[1:43:41] is present again in the church in this
[1:43:44] last stage as a last sign trying to head
[1:43:47] the people off from judgment for they
[1:43:49] reject him the word are now already come
[1:43:52] into judgment crucifying him aresh now
[1:43:55] watch Paul said that the word came in
[1:43:58] power as well as voice so there's a
[1:44:02] power in the church but there's got to
[1:44:04] be a voice that will channel that
[1:44:07] power come on Church the power has
[1:44:10] returned to the church but there's got
[1:44:12] to be a voice to clearly identify the
[1:44:14] power are y'all with me in the days of
[1:44:17] the
[1:44:18] voice of the seventh Angel when he shall
[1:44:22] begin to sound he will not just be a
[1:44:24] Moses brother Levi he'll be a Joshua and
[1:44:27] he will positionally place us amen not
[1:44:30] in Hybrid Power or denominational power
[1:44:33] but Timothy he'll put us right in the
[1:44:35] middle of the original Power with the
[1:44:38] same signs with the same wonders with
[1:44:40] the same manifestation with the same
[1:44:43] kind of spirit on the same kind of
[1:44:45] people acting the same kind of way
[1:44:47] listen y'all just forgive me if I shout
[1:44:49] a minute I've been restor restored I've
[1:44:51] been restored back to the original seed
[1:44:54] with the original life with the original
[1:44:56] anointing and it's got power and it's
[1:44:59] got
[1:45:01] voice now watch a prophet the word
[1:45:04] preached what is the word the truth what
[1:45:09] is the message Christ who is Christ the
[1:45:14] word what is the word the
[1:45:17] absolute what are we hearing this
[1:45:19] weekend abs solute
[1:45:22] truth are you hearing me watch The
[1:45:25] Prophet actually demonstrated itself now
[1:45:27] here's how it is it's like a flaming
[1:45:29] sword cutting sword it went into the
[1:45:32] consciousness of men and like a
[1:45:34] surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases
[1:45:38] and set the captives free what did that
[1:45:42] the word was like a surgeon's knife now
[1:45:45] watch and that knife has got to be able
[1:45:47] to go between the soul and the Spirit
[1:45:50] come on come on now young people you're
[1:45:51] a trium being you got flesh you got a
[1:45:54] spirit and you got a soul the two most

[1:46:03] the Holy Ghost on your flesh and your
[1:46:04] spirit and die and go to hell he said
[1:46:07] because the soul has to receive the Seal
[1:46:10] of the Holy Ghost that's why I'm telling
[1:46:12] you young people you better get more
[1:46:14] than so and so spoke over me or so and

[1:46:48] I have the truth I'm far on a
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:46:53] message say what you want to but one of
[1:46:56] these mornings brother Daniel the Holy
[1:46:58] Ghost is going to lift us out of this
[1:47:00] Dimension and we're going to be changed
[1:47:02] in the moment in the twinkle of an
[1:47:06] eye I'm talking about the keeping power
[1:47:09] of the Holy
[1:47:12] Ghost now somebody say everywhere those
[1:47:15] early Believers
[1:47:17] went they went preaching the gospel the
[1:47:19] word and God confirmed that word with
[1:47:22] signs following are you ready for this
[1:47:24] the sick were
[1:47:26] healed the Devils were cast out and they
[1:47:30] spoke in new tongues don't you take that
[1:47:32] out of the
[1:47:36] word that's in the word and you got to
[1:47:40] be a real word bride of Christ and to
[1:47:42] cast out devils and to speak in new
[1:47:45] tongues and to see the sick healed it
[1:47:47] takes the power of God but it took a
[1:47:49] prophet with the voice of the seventh
[1:47:52] angel to harness the power and say now
[1:47:55] we're not a bunch of wild beasts out
[1:47:56] here running around trying to do
[1:47:58] something we have a clear-cut decision
[1:48:00] from God we know what we're doing we
[1:48:02] know why we're praying how
[1:48:04] we're come on we didn't even know how to
[1:48:07] pray until this message come our way we
[1:48:09] didn't know how to believe until this
[1:48:11] message come our way come on y'all know
[1:48:13] what I'm talking about without this
[1:48:14] message every time God said no we'd be
[1:48:17] back out in the world and God don't love
[1:48:19] me and God don't care for me but because
[1:48:21] God sent a
[1:48:23] prophet I feel like preaching because
[1:48:26] God sent a prophet we now know when God
[1:48:28] says no that don't mean he don't love us
[1:48:31] that don't mean he's against us that
[1:48:33] means we got great faith to still trust
[1:48:35] him to still believe him even when he
[1:48:39] says
[1:48:42] no come on the power of the Resurrection
[1:48:45] is in the church but it took a voice it
[1:48:48] took a voice to bring some Direction
[1:48:50] that power I don't know why I'm here but
[1:48:51] I'm here I believe in the power of God
[1:48:54] but I believe in
[1:48:57] Direction
[1:48:59] now I'm running out of time that word
[1:49:02] was the word in action that word has
[1:49:05] never failed in the mouths of believing
[1:49:08] Christians are you ready for this there
[1:49:11] had to come a voice to bring direction
[1:49:14] to the power to release it to the bride
[1:49:17] now watch a prophet and in this last
[1:49:19] stage it is here stronger and greater
[1:49:22] than
[1:49:23] everwhere in the
[1:49:26] true word bride oh little little
[1:49:31] minority hold on to that word fill your
[1:49:34] mouth and heart with it and someday God
[1:49:37] will give you the kingdom what are you
[1:49:39] saying brother Andrew I'm saying we are
[1:49:41] not looking for the bride's Revival we
[1:49:44] are not trying to manufacture the
[1:49:46] bride's Revival right here we are in the
[1:49:50] middle of the bride's
[1:49:52] Revival this is your Revival you say
[1:49:54] what is it it is the word manifested In
[1:49:58] the Flesh of the Bride re said I
[1:50:00] challenge you to believe that Jesus
[1:50:02] Christ is revealed in the form of son of
[1:50:03] man in human flesh through the bride's
[1:50:06] body except his call now watch what a
[1:50:09] prophet was doing I'm I'm I'm turning
[1:50:11] the corner here a prophet was channeling
[1:50:14] you to accept his call to come back to
[1:50:17] God's provided way
[1:50:20] is that okay he was showing you that God
[1:50:24] has a provided way can I say this and
[1:50:27] God's provided way is the best way will
[1:50:32] you always remember that that God's
[1:50:34] provided way is the best way J you don't
[1:50:37] have to go find a way you don't have to
[1:50:39] go look for a way work up a way hunt out
[1:50:41] a way God has provided a way and it's
[1:50:45] the best way and a prophet says there's

[1:55:27] cry hello when you begin to
[1:55:30] cry God begins to answer when you begin
[1:55:35] to cry God begins to hear watch the
[1:55:39] Bible in judges three Israel cried to
[1:55:41] the Lord and the Lord raised up a
[1:55:43] deliver in judges 6 Israel cried to the
[1:55:46] Lord and the Lord raised up a prophet to
[1:55:49] lead them out can I can I can I take can
[1:55:51] I take five minutes here that the Lord
[1:55:53] sent a prophet under the children of
[1:55:55] Israel because the midianites my new
[1:55:57] ministry the god of Heaven who had all
[1:56:00] the prophets paragraph 84 to speak of
[1:56:02] the coming of the Lord Jesus and Jesus
[1:56:04] when he come he fulfilled every prophecy
[1:56:08] many of them was fulfilled at the
[1:56:11] cross where he deposited into your
[1:56:15] account when you was wounded for our
[1:56:18] transgression when David said my God is
[1:56:20] th forsaken me are y'all ready for this
[1:56:22] are you ready for this remember this
[1:56:24] okay when God sends a prophet a prophet
[1:56:28] speaks and God makes that
[1:56:33] truth brother silus when God sends a
[1:56:36] prophet the prophet speaks and God makes
[1:56:39] that truth if it's God that's where he
[1:56:41] had to say to know them if they spoke
[1:56:43] what they said come to pass they believe
[1:56:45] but if not I'm not with him now look if
[1:56:47] God who spoke in the holy prophets
[1:56:50] talked about the coming of Messiah to
[1:56:51] the glory and honor of God he said now
[1:56:53] watch if I know who would be president
[1:56:55] next fall and would tell it that would
[1:56:57] be prophecy that's right but God doesn't
[1:57:00] prophesy like that that's just to be
[1:57:02] playing but God does something to
[1:57:05] glorify him so when God speaks that
[1:57:08] Prophet picks up the thoughts of God and
[1:57:11] he speaks those thoughts now listen I'm
[1:57:13] I'm getting ready to close and when he
[1:57:15] speaks if it's coming from God then
[1:57:17] whatever he says God makes that the
[1:57:22] truth can I say this from 47 to 65 is
[1:57:26] the
[1:57:27] truth the church age book is the truth
[1:57:30] the seal book is the truth Church order
[1:57:33] is the truth come on Daniel 70 weeks is
[1:57:36] the truth the adoption series is the
[1:57:38] truth come on Church come on I'm
[1:57:41] preaching to you now are you hearing me
[1:57:43] it's all the truth when a prophet speaks
[1:57:47] if he come from God what he says God
[1:57:49] makes it the truth now watch you shall
[1:57:52] know the truth and the truth shall make
[1:57:54] you free so the prophet is not here
[1:57:57] today but there is a five-fold Ministry
[1:58:00] who is saying what he said and what he
[1:58:03] said was the truth and when they say
[1:58:05] what he's saiding the same liberating
[1:58:07] power comes into the building and begins
[1:58:09] to liberate the church are you all
[1:58:11] hearing me tonight are you hearing me I
[1:58:13] say it's time to speak what a prophet
[1:58:16] has already said and watch Liberation
[1:58:18] power break out in the church watch oh
[1:58:21] God I'm out of time Psalms 34:6 this
[1:58:24] poor man
[1:58:27] cried are y'all ready for this what's
[1:58:30] your idea of
[1:58:32] crying why that's a poor cry it's
[1:58:36] Malachi back there cry buddy are are you
[1:58:39] hearing me your idea of crying is just
[1:58:43] right but look here this poor man cried
[1:58:46] and the Lord heard him and saved him out
[1:58:50] of all of his troubles look at this word
[1:58:52] cry it means to
[1:58:55] recite so when you recite something that
[1:58:58] means you've already heard
[1:59:03] it when you recite it in other words
[1:59:06] you're saying what he said on the
[1:59:10] tapes you begin to cry out you begin to
[1:59:13] reide you begin to read to cry to
[1:59:15] Proclaim to speak with a loud voice
[1:59:18] remember said watch says recite or
[1:59:20] repeat what's been told or heard remind
[1:59:22] God of his Covenant Moses when he had
[1:59:25] vision from God the Lord appeared to him
[1:59:27] he quoted back his Word of Promise Moses
[1:59:30] was right on his road down in the
[1:59:32] absolute he said tith to the word of God
[1:59:35] and plead that promise in the third seal
[1:59:37] now if the churches oh my if the
[1:59:39] churches watch a prophet if the churches
[1:59:42] today amen would forget their Creeds
[1:59:45] forget their dogmas and just take the
[1:59:47] Bible and plead the proph promise that
[1:59:50] it would come affected to them listen
[1:59:52] young people don't you ever let somebody
[1:59:54] tell you we need to get away from a

[2:01:12] that you know what happens before long
[2:01:15] you'll be lower than a snake's

[2:03:13] Egypt beaten oppressed slaves confused
[2:03:19] bleeding hurting in a terrible condition
[2:03:23] right but there was a vision
[2:03:26] given and the vision said God will raise
[2:03:30] up a
[2:03:32] deliverer God will raise up a deliverer
[2:03:36] so when Israel begin to cry out to God
[2:03:38] they were not going why
[2:03:43] why their cry was not confusion their
[2:03:47] cry was God you
[2:03:49] said you would raise up a deliverer come
[2:03:53] on Church The Cry was coming from their
[2:03:56] bondage but the cry was not confusion
[2:03:59] the cry was the rehearsing of the word
[2:04:02] of God that Moses spoke over there young
[2:04:05] people I know the world is falling apart
[2:04:08] I know Leota is on its way down but I
[2:04:10] didn't come here to why over you I come
[2:04:12] here to cry over you and to say what a

[2:04:52] your cry it becomes your confession it
[2:04:56] becomes your voice it becomes your
[2:04:58] language it becomes what you say in the
[2:05:01] morning it's what you say in the evening
[2:05:04] it's what you say when you feel it it's
[2:05:06] what you say when you don't it's what

[2:12:39] the blood is going to run from his side
[2:12:41] and it's going to meet in the middle and
[2:12:42] it's going to run down on his

[2:17:03] sword and it's
[2:17:04] sharp it's two-edged it's
[2:17:09] quick but it's a surgeon's
[2:17:12] knife and it knows how to perform
[2:17:15] surgery it knows how to cut between the
[2:17:18] spirit and the Soul between the joints
[2:17:20] and the marrow and the
[2:17:22] bone it knows how to go in there and cut
[2:17:25] things out it knows how to circumcise

[2:18:27] You've Lost Your
[2:18:30] hold now father I pray tonight Lord that
[2:18:34] on this opening night may they see the
[2:18:37] word of
[2:18:38] Liberation may they see that liberating
[2:18:41] word has the power Lord maybe some of
[2:18:44] them there's limits on their
[2:18:46] thoughts Lord they think this as far as
[2:18:48] they can go they think they've got all
[2:18:51] that they can get they think that God
[2:18:53] don't love them they think that the
[2:18:54] world's against them they think that
[2:18:56] their family is against them they think
[2:18:58] this is against them they think that
[2:19:00] Lord but Lord this word is a liberating
[2:19:03] knife tonight and when it begins to cut
[2:19:07] Lord it'll cut all the limits off of
[2:19:09] their
[2:19:10] thoughts and they'll begin to think that
[2:19:12] which is pure and that which was holy
[2:19:14] and that which was of good
[2:19:16] things Lord there may be thoughts on
[2:19:18] their behavior Lord there may be rather
[2:19:21] limits on their behavior but Lord when
[2:19:23] that word begins to discern oh God they
[2:19:26] want to act like the bride they want to
[2:19:28] manifest the power of God oh they want
[2:19:30] to enjoy their salvation they want to
[2:19:33] praise you without any restrictions they
[2:19:35] want to love you without any any
[2:19:37] restrictions oh God they want to worship
[2:19:40] and freedom they want to praise and
[2:19:42] freedom but the devil's doing everything
[2:19:44] he can to suppress and suppress and
[2:19:48] suppress but Lord May that word of
[2:19:51] Liberation may it liberate them tonight
[2:19:53] God in their worship this
[2:19:57] weekend Oh
[2:19:59] God maybe there's a spirit pressing on
[2:20:02] their
[2:20:03] confession limiting their
[2:20:05] confession maybe there's certain things
[2:20:07] they've been taught that they really
[2:20:09] can't confess because maybe brother Bram
[2:20:11] was his opinion or they really can't
[2:20:13] believe that because that was his idea
[2:20:15] Lord I rebuke those oppressive
[2:20:18] spirits and father I invite you as the
[2:20:21] surgeon take the knife in your hand this
[2:20:25] weekend take the two-edged

[2:20:57] that the Lord is using to take that

[2:46:59] presence of the Lord is here
[2:47:01] tonight
[2:47:04] hallelujah oh I'm so thankful for
[2:47:09] it I think a message like tonight is so
[2:47:12] crucial because I
[2:47:15] I was raised in
[2:47:19] Pentecost
[2:47:22] and we felt we had the truth and we had
[2:47:26] a lot of wonderful gifts and a lot of
[2:47:29] gifted men and a lot of wonderful
[2:47:32] prophecies
[2:47:33] and man
[2:47:36] and the problem
[2:47:38] was instead of depending on the vitamins
[2:47:42] of the food and man and doing what it
[2:47:46] take took to to understand who we were
[2:47:49] and to believe the word and we were like
[2:47:52] some of you guys that amen drinking the
[2:47:55] energy drinks these days that's and
[2:47:58] those energy drinks will kill you if
[2:48:01] you're living on that stuff it'll kill
[2:48:04] you it puts a buzz in you but it don't
[2:48:06] last
[2:48:08] long it gives you a little bit of an
[2:48:10] emotion but it won't keep
[2:48:13] you gifts are never meant to satisfy you
[2:48:19] thankful for the gifts but this
[2:48:22] message is what stabilized this
[2:48:29] boy
[2:48:32] Hallelujah I remember as a a as a as a
[2:48:36] kid amen just praying that my pastor
[2:48:39] would have a word of the Lord for me I'd
[2:48:43] just pray and I'd I'd sat there outside
[2:48:45] his office all by myself when no one was
[2:48:48] there in the church and I'd say God if
[2:48:50] you just speak to my pastor to encourage
[2:48:54] me and and you know what the Lord would
[2:48:57] give something to my pastor for me and
[2:49:00] oh it was so
[2:49:04] good but a couple days later I was
[2:49:06] needing to know it again I I was needing
[2:49:08] someone else to say something you see I
[2:49:11] become
[2:49:13] addicted to a small
[2:49:16] fix but see God's given
[2:49:19] us Malachi 4 a word
[2:49:24] prophet and if we can take what that
[2:49:27] word Prophet brought us it'll stabilize
[2:49:32] you and buddy I had my ups and downs and
[2:49:36] those that amen that knew me back then I
[2:49:38] I was high and I was low and I it was it
[2:49:41] was but brother Hallelujah I remember
[2:49:44] when I was was 23 24 when the message
[2:49:48] was given to me presented to me I sat
[2:49:51] down and cried like a
[2:49:53] baby I
[2:49:55] cried as I read this there was something
[2:49:59] that was telling me who I was as I was
[2:50:02] listening there was something that was
[2:50:04] telling me what I was created for and
[2:50:08] there was no highs that could take me
[2:50:10] any higher and there was no lows that
[2:50:12] could separate me there was no man's
[2:50:15] prophecy that would separate me there
[2:50:17] was no no opinion here and opinion there
[2:50:21] to tear me back and forth as I it's my
[2:50:24] nature amen I I'm sort of timid I want
[2:50:27] to fit in I want to belong but brother
[2:50:30] when I found the message of the hour oh
[2:50:33] that's what I want to belong
[2:50:35] to
[2:50:37] amen
[2:50:39] hallelujah now I'm
[2:50:41] [Applause]
[2:50:43] thankful
[2:50:45] I appreciate prophecies I appreciate
[2:50:49] dreams and I think I think they're in
[2:50:50] the church today need a line them up
[2:50:52] with Malachi 4 he taught us how to use
[2:50:55] them you know well praise the Lord
[2:50:58] Brother random says now if you miss it
[2:51:00] one time he says you need to stop go and
[2:51:03] pray for that lion devil to get off of
[2:51:05] you so I believe the Holy Ghost still
[2:51:07] works today I'm come
[2:51:10] on someone says well no one can be
[2:51:13] accurate No one brother Brandon was the
[2:51:14] only one accurate well then don't
[2:51:16] prophesy amen because I believe in a
[2:51:19] accurate holy ghost that can give an
[2:51:22] accurate prophecy that can give an
[2:51:24] accurate
[2:51:26] Hallelujah but when it all said and done
[2:51:29] give me this
[2:51:31] word that
[2:51:33] is hallelujah when I'm feeling really
[2:51:36] high and I want to dance and Shout well
[2:51:39] I'm just going to dance and Shout
[2:51:41] because the Bible says I could do it but
[2:51:44] there's some times I wake up and I don't
[2:51:46] feel like I've got the Holy Ghost
[2:51:48] there's times I wake up and I don't know
[2:51:51] if I am a believer I I mean the devil's
[2:51:53] beating me all around but you know what
[2:51:55] I do I go right back to what that
[2:51:57] message said that there is a
[2:51:59] predestinated seed on the inside of me
[2:52:02] whether I feel it whether I understand
[2:52:05] it there's something within me that is
[2:52:09] screaming out
[2:52:12] amen can you say Amen
[2:52:16] [Music]
