[14:42] something that the world wants. Amen.
[14:46] Like, I want what they got. We need to
[14:48] be salty that they'll get thirsty this
[14:50] morning. [music] We need to be
[14:51] desperate. I need to be more desperate.
[14:54] Amen. And I'm not preaching at you. I'm
[14:56] preaching at me. Amen. Would you help me
[14:58] this morning? Praise the Lord. Amen.

[45:55] uh but we're just we're just really glad
[45:57] to to have y'all every time you come.
[46:00] Amen. There Hebrews 11 and8 it says by
[46:05] faith Abraham
[46:07] when he was called to go out into a
[46:10] place which he should after receive for
[46:12] an inheritance
[46:14] obeyed.
[46:16] and he went out not knowing whether he
[46:20] went by faith he sojourned in the land
[46:24] of promise as in a strange country
[46:27] dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
[46:30] Abraham the heirs with him of the same
[46:32] promise for he looked for a city which
[46:37] has foundations
[46:39] whose builder and maker is God. Now, if
[46:43] if we were to uh go on down to the 13th
[46:46] verse, just to save time, these all died
[46:49] in faith, not having received the
[46:51] promises, but having seen them a far
[46:54] off, were persuaded of them, and
[46:56] embraced them, and confessed that they
[46:59] were strangers and pilgrims on the
[47:01] earth. For they that say such things
[47:05] declare plainly that they seek a
[47:07] country.
[47:08] And truly if they had been mindful of
[47:11] that country from whence they came out,
[47:13] they might have had opportunity to have
[47:15] returned.
[47:16] But now they desire a better country,
[47:19] that is in heavenly.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Uh wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[47:24] called their God, for he hath prepared
[47:27] for them a city.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Now I also want to look here in Isaiah
[47:35] the 11th chapter and the 10th verse.
[47:39] Amen. Isaiah and 11.
[47:43] This was a promise to those who

[47:54] here on this earth and but God has given
[47:58] us. Amen. in Isaiah 11 and10. And in
[48:03] that day they there shall be a root of
[48:06] Jesse which shall stand for an in sign
[48:11] of the people to it shall the Gentiles
[48:15] seek and his rest shall be glorious. Got
[48:19] one more scripture John 12 and32.
[48:23] Amen. And then we'll have let you have

[48:40] victory, a banner of of that country.

[48:48] from the earth,
[48:50] I will draw all men unto me. Let's go to
[48:55] the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to

[1:05:16] The blue represented the vigilance,
[1:05:19] PERSEVERANCE, AND JUSTICE.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY SAY THE ALTERNATING RED AND
[1:05:25] WHITE STRIPES WHICH SYMBOLIZE THE blood
[1:05:28] shed and the purity of the American
[1:05:31] people. AMEN. AND SO TOGETHER THE THE
[1:05:36] STARS AND THE STRIPES WOULD WOULD SYMBOL
[1:05:39] BE A POWERFUL SYMBOL OF AMERICAN
[1:05:42] IDENTITY, A A POWERFUL SYMBOL OF
[1:05:45] AMERICAN PRIDE. IT WOULD STAND FOR
[1:05:48] FREEDOM AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THAT'S WHAT

[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT SOME SONS. I'VE GOT SOME
[1:28:45] DAUGHTERS THAT IT'S IN YOUR PRISON
[1:28:47] HOUSES AND I AM DECLARING TO YOU I'M
[1:28:50] COMING AFTER THEM. [cheering]
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; NOW, he didn't take us all home at that
[1:28:57] day. Amen. But the FLAG HAS ALREADY BEEN
[1:29:00] SET. THE EMBLEM IS ALREADY THERE. SATAN
[1:29:03] HAS TO SEE [screaming] THAT EMBLEM.
[1:29:06] SATAN HAS TO SEE THAT THAT CROSS IS
[1:29:10] FOREVER [screaming] MORE GOD'S IN sign
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[1:29:19] Can you say amen?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; It's an in sign to you when you see the
[1:29:23] when you see every time you see he every
[1:29:26] time that you see that cross
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; every time you look that's the emblem
[1:29:32] that's the emblem of eternal life.
[1:29:34] That's an emblem. Oh, come on, church.
[1:29:37] Amen. It's an emblem. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:29:40] The scripture says there in the 14th
[1:29:42] verse of Romans, keep keep that note.
[1:29:44] Just keep that out there. I think it's
[1:29:45] better that way. UH ROMANS 5 AND 14.
[1:29:48] NEVERTHELESS, DEATH REIGNED FROM Adam to
[1:29:51] Moses, even over them that had not
[1:29:54] sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[1:29:57] transgression, who is the figure of him
[1:30:01] that is to come.
[1:30:03] Hallelujah. Now, this was this was God's
[1:30:06] first emblem that failed. BUT THE
[1:30:11] PROPHET WAS SAYING GOD WAS GOING to
[1:30:13] raise another emblem. And it was GOING
[1:30:15] TO BE GOD HIMSELF.
[1:30:18] It was GOING TO BE GOD. ARE Y'ALL
[1:30:19] HEARING ME? ADAM FAILED. AMEN. IT WAS A
[1:30:23] BEAUTIFUL SIGN. IT WAS A [screaming]
[1:30:24] BEAUTIFUL EMBLEM. IT WAS A BE OH, IT WAS
[1:30:26] WONDERFUL. HALLELUJAH. BUT THE EMBLEM
[1:30:29] THAT GOD WAS GOING TO RAISE, THEY COULD
[1:30:31] KILL HIM. THEY WOULD MOCK HIM. THEY
[1:30:33] WOULD SCOURGE HIM. THEY WOULD
[1:30:35] [screaming] MAKE FUN OF HIM. BUT THAT
[1:30:37] WORD MADE FLESH. IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN
[1:30:41] THAT ONE THAT FELL IN THE GARDEN OF. ARE
[1:30:43] Y'ALL HEARING ME?
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Jesus isn't another good man. HE'S
[1:30:47] NOT A PREACHER. HE'S NOT A POPE. HE'S
[1:30:49] NOT JUST A PROPHET. JESUS WAS GOD
[1:30:52] HIMSELF. HE WAS GOD'S EMBLEM [screaming]
[1:30:55] TO THE WORLD THAT THERE IS LIFE.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:01] There is life. That's it.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; I've come to bear life. Amen. The
[1:31:07] Pharisees, they were going after, they
[1:31:09] were they were interested in washing
[1:31:10] pots and living holy on and fasting and
[1:31:13] they were doing this and that just as a
[1:31:16] show. Amen. But Jesus says, "Inside you,
[1:31:18] you're just full of dead men. You are
[1:31:20] supplers.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're whitewashed on the outside
[1:31:23] and you look pretty, but on the inside
[1:31:25] of you, you're dead."
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; But he says, "But I've come to give life
[1:31:30] I've come that you might have life more
[1:31:33] abundantly. I'VE NOT COME FOR YOU TO
[1:31:35] LIVE IN THIS CIVILIZATION ALONE. I'VE
[1:31:36] I'VE NOT COME TO JUST GIVE YOU NICE
[1:31:39] HOUSES. I'VE NOT COME JUST FOR YOU TO
[1:31:40] RAISE FAMILIES. [screaming]
[1:31:42] I'VE COME THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE MORE
[1:31:44] ABUNDANTLY.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; I'VE [screaming] COME THAT YOU CAN HAVE
[1:31:48] A PEACE THAT GOES BEYOND AN IMMORTAL
[1:31:51] MAN.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; I've come to give life.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm still on the topic of
[1:31:59] thanksgiving. THANKSGIVING. BECAUSE IN
[1:32:02] THIS LAST DAY, AMEN, WHEN IT ALL SEEMED
[1:32:04] THAT RELIGION HAD TAKEN OVER AGAIN, WHEN
[1:32:07] IT SEEMED, AMEN. THAT THE THAT ALL OF
[1:32:09] THE CATERPILLAR, THE CANKER WORM AND THE
[1:32:11] PALMER WORM HAD [screaming] EAT UP THE
[1:32:13] TREE, GOD SENT US A MESSAGE FROM ABOVE
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; TO DECLARE [screaming]
[1:32:19] HE'S ALIVE
[1:32:21] TODAY.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It was it was [snorts] the
[1:32:29] brazen SERPENT THAT WAS RAISED UP. It
[1:32:32] was an emblem of mercy and healing and
[1:32:34] peace for those who had who had been
[1:32:38] bit. Those who were dying. They could
[1:32:41] look. Keep it up there, Sister Keys.
[1:32:43] THEY COULD LOOK AND AND THEY WOULD LIVE.
[1:32:47] It was God's emblem.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; But then they turned around and they
[1:32:51] took the emblem of healing.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; And they begin to worship it. worship
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; and they began what can you say amen
[1:32:58] made denomination around it
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus came and then what did they do
[1:33:04] they turned Jesus God's great [sighs]
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; until we have what 30,000 denominations
[1:33:12] today
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; turn it into a creed and turn it into a
[1:33:16] church joining turning it into a
[1:33:18] money-making scheme that's all the
[1:33:21] church has become a money-making scheme
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; come Come on. Let's see. [panting]
[1:33:27] Jesus is not money making schemes.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; I'm way off my notes.
[1:33:36] [laughter]
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, when it looked all
[1:33:39] hopeless, when it looked like everyone
[1:33:41] had gone after emotion, WHEN IT LOOKED
[1:33:43] LIKE EVERYONE HAD GONE AFTER THE THE
[1:33:45] ALMIGHTY DOLLAR, WHEN PREACHERS HAD
[1:33:46] FALLEN, AMEN. WHEN WHEN OUR WHEN OUR
[1:33:49] CHURCHES WERE NO LONGER LOOKING LIKE
[1:33:51] CHURCHES ANYMORE. COME ON NOW. HOLINESS
[1:33:54] WAS GONE. AMEN. WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE
[1:33:56] WOMEN DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A WOMAN
[1:33:58] [screaming] AND A MAN DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
[1:33:59] BE A MAN AND FATHERS DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
[1:34:02] BE FATHERS. HALLELUJAH. GOD [screaming]
[1:34:06] RAISED UP AN EMBLEM IN THIS DAY.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. [screaming]
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; SO THAT YOU WOULD KNOW A LIVING GOD, A
[1:34:14] LIVING CHRIST.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:22] when death reigned.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah.
[1:34:26] Now something has gone arry.
[1:34:29] Hallelujah.
[1:34:31] But that 15th verse of amen there in
[1:34:34] Romans 5 and 15. But not as the offense
[1:34:38] so also was the free gift. For it, if
[1:34:42] through the offense of one, many be
[1:34:45] dead, much more the grace of God, and
[1:34:49] the gift by grace, which is by one man
[1:34:51] Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many.
[1:34:54] Not as it was by one that sinned, so is
[1:34:58] the gift. For the judgment was by one to
[1:35:01] condemnation, but the free gift is of
[1:35:05] many offenses unto justification.
[1:35:09] For if by one man's offense death
[1:35:11] reigned by one, much more they which
[1:35:16] receive abundance of grace, and the gift
[1:35:20] of righteousness shall reign in life by
[1:35:24] one, Jesus Christ.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Now, amen. Death knows no boundaries.
[1:35:35] You can sit in this church here. You can
[1:35:37] be faithful as faithful can be. You can
[1:35:39] pay your ti. You can come to this church
[1:35:41] and never miss a service. Amen. For for
[1:35:44] 30 years and not have the life of God.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; That emblem is an emblem of life.
[1:35:55] God so loved.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; GOD SO LOVED THAT he gave.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say man?
[1:36:07] Hallelujah.
[1:36:09] God raised God raised it today. Amen.
[1:36:14] That emblem, that banner,
[1:36:20] that great great emblem right there.
[1:36:27] Hell knows about it.
[1:36:31] believers know about it.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Because there's a correlation between
[1:36:36] the believer and hell. Hell once held
[1:36:39] the believer.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; But life come to set us free from the
[1:36:45] powers of hell.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Life come to bring me back.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it came for.
[1:36:54] Hallelujah. Amen. God raised his son.
[1:36:57] Amen. and that bloody cross would
[1:36:59] forever. The prophet would say that's
[1:37:02] how Rahab's house stood on the walls of
[1:37:05] Jericho when all the rest of it fell
[1:37:08] because there was a scarlet thread down
[1:37:10] the outside.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; God honored that scarlet thread. AND
[1:37:15] THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE CHILDREN OF
[1:37:17] ISRAEL NOT TO BE SLAIN in Egypt, the
[1:37:19] older son, BECAUSE THERE WAS BLOOD ON
[1:37:22] THE DOOR. AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THE
[1:37:25] CHURCH TODAY IN THE LAST PLAGUE OF
[1:37:27] DEATH. THE CHURCH IS THE ONLY ONE
[1:37:30] THAT'LL LIVE TODAY AND NOT GO OUT INTO
[1:37:33] UNIVERSALISM AND SO FORTH OUT INTO THIS
[1:37:36] MODERNISTIC SOCIAL GOSPEL IS THOSE WHO'S
[1:37:39] GOT THE BLOOD ON THE DOORPOST OUT HERE.
[1:37:43] THE BLOOD OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BORN
[1:37:45] AGAIN. THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE STANDING
[1:37:48] IF THEY'RE REALLY BORN AGAIN. THEY'RE
[1:37:50] NOT BEING IN UH THEY'LL NOT BE ENTANGLED
[1:37:53] WITH THE EVERY YOKE AND EVERY DOCTRINE
[1:37:55] AND TOSSED ABOUT HERE AND THERE AND
[1:37:57] EVERY CULT. They know where they're
[1:38:00] standing in Christ through the blood.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; On a hill far away stood an old rugged
[1:38:10] cross, the emblem
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; of suffering
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; and shame. The suffering you were
[1:38:18] taking, the suffering, the dying that
[1:38:20] you were going, YOUR YOUR MISERY THAT
[1:38:22] you were to take. Jesus took the misery,
[1:38:25] the suffering, the hurt, the pain, the
[1:38:28] heartache upon himself.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; So that we in turn can have life
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; that we in turn can be can can live. Oh,
[1:38:39] can you say amen?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, I just want
[1:38:43] you to remember now, am I doing all
[1:38:45] right here this morning? I want you to
[1:38:47] remember our homeland is not here.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God.
[1:38:55] Amen. Sister Kaylee, the next time
[1:38:56] you're feeling all down and lonely and
[1:38:58] Amen. and rough and waking up on the
[1:39:01] wrong side of the bed and having a bad
[1:39:02] hair day and all of that all at one
[1:39:04] time. Hallelujah. Remember, this is not
[1:39:06] our homeland.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; This is not our homeland. [applause]
[1:39:10] I'm living in this world, but this is
[1:39:12] not my homeland. I I I I can Well,
[1:39:15] praise the Lord.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, we get beat up. Oh, we get Oh my.
[1:39:20] But you see, God knew that we were going
[1:39:21] to be two naturatured.
[1:39:24] You're of Jesus. But the Apostle Paul
[1:39:26] says, "I'm willing in spirit, but my
[1:39:28] flesh, my flesh." In another place, the
[1:39:31] Apostle Paul says, "I die daily."
[1:39:34] What are you, are you with me? So there
[1:39:36] there there is that that is of an
[1:39:38] eternal. Brother Brandham says when when
[1:39:39] he was born again, he he become he had
[1:39:41] two natures. One of earth to die and one
[1:39:44] of heaven to live. We've got we WE KNOW
[1:39:47] WE SOMETIMES WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE in
[1:39:49] between. But I'm here to tell you IF
[1:39:51] THERE'S EVER A TIME FOR US TO MAKE THAT
[1:39:53] OUR EMBLEM, NOT OLD GLORY AND NOT OU AND
[1:39:57] NOT NOT OSU AND NOT WHATEVER THE BANNERS
[1:40:00] THEY WANT TO PUT UP AROUND. AMEN. SOME
[1:40:02] HALLELUJAH. I'M I I'VE SEEN A LOT OF
[1:40:05] EMBLEMS PUT up in a LOT OF BEDROOMS AS
[1:40:07] I'VE WORKED OVER THE YEARS, BUT I'M HERE
[1:40:09] TO TELL YOU THE GREATEST EMBLEM
[1:40:11] [screaming] YOU'LL EVER HAVE IS NOT
[1:40:13] SOMETHING OF MICHAEL JORDAN BACK WAY
[1:40:15] BACK 30 YEARS AGO. THE GREATEST EMBLEM
[1:40:17] YOU'LL EVER HAVE IS THE GREAT SON OF GOD
[1:40:21] THAT CAME AND HE WAS HE WAS ELEVATED
[1:40:24] [screaming] BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR
[1:40:26] YOUR SHAME, YOUR SIN, YOUR SICKNESS.
[1:40:30] [applause]
[1:40:31] A right.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:40] Oh my. Now,
[1:40:43] Amen. You see our homeland. You say,
[1:40:47] "Now, Brother Window, can you give me
[1:40:48] some scripture?" Why, of course. Amen.
[1:40:52] They're in there in in in Galatians 4
[1:40:55] and 26. And you can go and put these
[1:40:56] scriptures up keys. Thank you. Amen. For
[1:40:59] finding that. That's a beautiful
[1:41:00] picture. Galatians 4 and 26.
[1:41:04] But Jerusalem,
[1:41:08] which is above,
[1:41:11] is free,
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; which is the mother
[1:41:16] of all God's predestinated seed.
[1:41:19] [laughter]
[1:41:21] It's free.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; You're living in America, but you're not
[1:41:25] free.
[1:41:29] Just just just go without paying your
[1:41:30] house taxes. Hallelujah.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Just go without
[1:41:36] Yeah. It's not free. Right.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a Jerusalem
[1:41:45] which is from above. Not earthly,
[1:41:48] not not not natural Jerusalem. There is
[1:41:51] a Jerusalem. And then he would say, "And
[1:41:53] it is the mother of us all. All God's
[1:41:57] elected. Can you say amen? Amen. He
[1:42:01] says, "Now, but ye are come." Amen. Uh
[1:42:04] uh there Hebrews 12:22, "Ye are come
[1:42:08] unto Mount Zion, unto the city of the
[1:42:12] living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to
[1:42:15] an innumerable
[1:42:17] company of angels, to the general
[1:42:20] assembly and church of the firstborn."
[1:42:24] Who's the firstborn? the inside. I will
[1:42:29] raise up an insign
[1:42:32] and the Gentiles shall Well,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; I hope y'all putting it all together.
[1:42:38] Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen? He
[1:42:40] says to the general assembly of the
[1:42:41] church of the firstborn, Jesus Christ,
[1:42:43] which are written in heaven, AND TO GOD
[1:42:48] THE JUDGE OF ALL, TO THE SPIRITS OF JUST
[1:42:51] men made perfect. Can you say amen?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. which are written in heaven. When
[1:42:57] is your names written in heaven? The
[1:42:58] Bible says you were chosen in Christ
[1:42:59] before the foundation of the world.
[1:43:01] That's in Ephesians 1 and4. The Bible
[1:43:03] says there in Revelations uh uh the the
[1:43:06] 13th chapter that your name was written
[1:43:08] in the lamb's book OF LIFE BEFORE THE
[1:43:10] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. He also says
[1:43:13] the same THING IN REVELATIONS THE 17TH
[1:43:15] CHAPTER. THERE IS AMEN RECOGNITION.
[1:43:18] THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE'S names who are
[1:43:20] already in that land. You needed TO HAVE
[1:43:23] A REPRESENTATIVE. YOU HAD TO HAVE
[1:43:26] SOMEBODY [screaming] TO COME ON.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE SLAVES. YOU WERE BORN HERE. YOU
[1:43:31] WERE STILL YOU [screaming] WERE BORN IN
[1:43:33] SIN AND SHAPING IN INIQUITY. YOU HAD TO
[1:43:36] HAVE SOMETHING TO REPRESENT the land you
[1:43:40] came from.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And that's why God in this last day
[1:43:45] didn't send a preacher,
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; didn't send a pope, he sent a prophet.
[1:43:51] Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And that prophet come commissioned from
[1:43:54] the other land.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; He [laughter]
[1:43:58] he visited the other land. He come back
[1:44:00] AND SAID, "I SEEN y'all in THAT OTHER
[1:44:02] LAND." ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? THERE HAD
[1:44:05] TO be an emblem. When Satan tore down
[1:44:09] the emblem,
[1:44:12] he tore down Christ
[1:44:16] and he hid him in a dark tomb.
[1:44:20] And now it looked like all hope was
[1:44:22] gone.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; It looked like all
[1:44:26] Now the disciples are walking down the
[1:44:28] road to Emmas.
[1:44:30] We had hoped. We had hoped. We had
[1:44:33] hoped.
[1:44:37] But now he's dead. When it looked like
[1:44:40] it was dead,
[1:44:43] [clears throat]
[1:44:44] God says, "No, he has to die to carry
[1:44:47] your sins to Hades." Now you Now he's
[1:44:52] going to rise again as an everlasting
[1:44:56] symbol
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; of life.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:45:03] Yeah.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Down through the church ages, we have we
[1:45:08] WENT THROUGH WHAT PENTECOST WAS, THE
[1:45:10] BOOK OF ACTS. That was that was God's
[1:45:12] emblem.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; God living in humanity.
[1:45:17] Then through the dark ages,
[1:45:18] denominations come in 3 325 AD. Here
[1:45:22] come amen the council of churches. And
[1:45:25] they begin to Amen. We don't believe in
[1:45:28] this. We don't believe in that. We they
[1:45:31] took no longer praying to the invisible
[1:45:34] God, living true to his word. Now
[1:45:38] they're putting up Peter and Mary and
[1:45:41] all of these others so you can bow down
[1:45:43] to a physical image, an idol, and
[1:45:46] worship.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; God would never
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; never come back to an idol.
[1:45:55] Man is greater than any piece of brass,
[1:45:58] any piece of wood, any any car. Man
[1:46:02] would be greater than any metal. Are you
[1:46:04] hearing me now? God God would live in
[1:46:08] Jesus Christ. And then he would come pay
[1:46:11] the price for you and for me, wash away
[1:46:14] our sins, empower us, deputize us with
[1:46:17] the Holy Spirit from that land, and we
[1:46:20] would now become living monuments,
[1:46:23] living idols. we would become living,
[1:46:26] WALKING, TALKING. OH, COME ON
[1:46:28] [screaming] NOW. [applause]
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ANOINTED WITH THIS. YOU'VE GOT
[1:46:31] THE SAME BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT
[1:46:34] JESUS HAD. [screaming]
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; JESUS HAD IT WITHOUT MEASURE. YOU'VE GOT
[1:46:38] IT WITH MEASURE.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DID GOD WHAT DID SATAN DO?
[1:46:47] He got their attention going back to a
[1:46:49] to a to to to St. Mary to an image of
[1:46:52] Peter and Paul, an image of Jesus.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; And what God's image was,
[1:47:01] God wanted to live in you.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; He would live in me. He would live in
[1:47:08] you. What can you say? Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; He would live. He would live in us. He
[1:47:12] would live in humanity. It would be a
[1:47:14] representation
[1:47:16] that they're from another land.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; You'd be different. Now you're no longer
[1:47:20] in the prison cells. Now you're walking
[1:47:22] with a Now you're walking with a with a
[1:47:25] promise. You've got the very guarantee
[1:47:28] in your hand. The token, the emblem of
[1:47:31] eternal life is within you through the
[1:47:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Prophet would say
[1:47:41] it's a perfect place
[1:47:46] calling you to that perfection.
[1:47:51] It's a perfect place
[1:47:57] calling everyone
[1:48:00] of his sons and daughters.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; You thought and you accepted the
[1:48:06] message.
[1:48:09] It's the other way around. The message
[1:48:10] is accepting you.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; It's the message
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; calling your name.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; It's the emblem saying, "I still live."
[1:48:22] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Do you love him today?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood of Jesus. Think of
[1:48:32] it. The dripping bloody word.
[1:48:36] The blood. The word of God bleeding.
[1:48:40] The blood to wash the bride in. Yes,
[1:48:44] sir. She stands perfect, virgin,
[1:48:46] unadulterated. She never sinned in the
[1:48:49] first place. You were just trapped. You
[1:48:51] were born in Satan's prison houses. But
[1:48:55] there is a soul
[1:48:58] that is a citizen.
[1:49:00] And the prophet would say she was
[1:49:02] trapped into it. See, there's the
[1:49:05] father's house that he's going to
[1:49:08] prepare.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen."
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; As I begin to bring my thoughts to a
[1:49:17] finish here now,
[1:49:21] when God sends his word to us, he sent
[1:49:24] his word to heal. He sent his word to
[1:49:27] deliver.
[1:49:34] If you're homeland is not heaven,
[1:49:47] the word of the king means nothing to
[1:49:49] you.
[1:49:52] If the homeland is not that new
[1:49:54] Jerusalem, the words of the king
[1:50:00] You would trade that out for a
[1:50:01] denominational creed or you'd trade that
[1:50:03] out for well mama thinks and daddy
[1:50:05] thinks and I think
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; because that message came to us all.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; It came to the world.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; But only the elect would hear it.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet would say, "It's in the name
[1:50:24] of the Lord I say this." He get the
[1:50:26] Protestant church the same thing and she
[1:50:27] won't do it. The messages have shook
[1:50:31] everywhere and she won't do it. She's
[1:50:34] going to have her own dogmas and creeds.
[1:50:35] I don't care how much you explain it.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; But then on the other side, God's got an
[1:50:42] elect
[1:50:44] that is going to take that word
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; and all hell is going to be against it.
[1:50:52] And yet that believer is invincible.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet would say Satan has tried to
[1:50:58] spray it like he did Eve. He tried to
[1:51:00] spray it, but he failed with his
[1:51:03] repellent on here. He was a
[1:51:04] predestinated seed. They couldn't take
[1:51:07] him in. They couldn't make him a
[1:51:09] Pharisee and a Sadducee. They couldn't
[1:51:12] make him belong to any organization. He
[1:51:15] was God's predestinated spoken word. And
[1:51:18] Satan could not throw his unbelief on
[1:51:20] him. He had a repellent on him.
[1:51:25] God, spray us with a repellent is my
[1:51:27] prayer. That's right. He says, "Then the
[1:51:30] spirit moved on him and sent him to
[1:51:32] Calvary to the CROSS TO BRING LIGHT IN
[1:51:35] THIS day and light to all the
[1:51:38] predestinated seeds to the church of
[1:51:41] this day, transforming sons and
[1:51:43] daughters of God into his presence."
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; CAN I HEAR A GREAT BIG AMEN?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:53] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:54] HALLELUJAH. We're going to a land. Well,
[1:51:57] can you say amen?
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; I said we're going to a land.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; GOD SENDS US THESE THINGS. God sends us
[1:52:04] these things to us. Amen. For a reason.
[1:52:07] Oh, can you say amen?
[1:52:10] There was a chaplain one time that that
[1:52:14] was
[1:52:15] there
[1:52:17] that was a chaplain there in World War
[1:52:19] I.
[1:52:21] And
[1:52:23] when he had come home, he was telling a
[1:52:26] story to brother Brandham.
[1:52:30] And he he would he said that Sergeant
[1:52:35] had asked him one day to go with him out
[1:52:36] and and and and survey the the damage
[1:52:40] that was done on the on the on the
[1:52:43] battlefront. It it had been it was just
[1:52:45] it was just rough. There was they've
[1:52:48] been fighting with the gas and I mean
[1:52:50] everything was dead. Everything was
[1:52:52] dead. just
[1:52:54] um
[1:52:56] that it would it was it was it was a bad
[1:53:00] it was a bad time just
[1:53:04] and uh
[1:53:08] you know he he would
[1:53:14] when he went out you know he had even
[1:53:16] said they thrown that ma mustard gas and
[1:53:19] chlorine gas and it said just burnt all
[1:53:22] he said The leaves were off the trees,
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; There wasn't a living thing anywhere.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; And the soldiers were in such a
[1:53:35] a bad frame of mind. They'd been
[1:53:37] fighting and and it was just
[1:53:46] He says, "But on on on an Easter
[1:53:49] morning,"
[1:53:50] he said, "I walked through the little
[1:53:53] the little area with the
[1:53:57] where the soldiers were at, where the
[1:53:58] wounded boys." [snorts] So I walked with
[1:54:01] a nurse and she was giving
[1:54:03] those wounded boys
[1:54:09] an American rose.
[1:54:16] You know one an American used
[1:54:22] he said them boys
[1:54:26] would grab the rose
[1:54:30] and would just start screaming
[1:54:33] and crying
[1:54:37] because they knew
[1:54:40] that it come from home.
[1:54:43] It was sent from home.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; The little rose,
[1:54:52] it would cling to it
[1:54:54] because it was an emblem
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; from the homeland.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Are y'all catching my thoughts here this
[1:55:03] morning?
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Do you realize
[1:55:08] that this message that we have received
[1:55:17] The message
[1:55:18] that we have received in this day
[1:55:22] is a rose
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; from the homeland.
[1:55:27] It's a rose saying the king lives
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; when he's reading the hearts.
[1:55:40] When God is coming in and giving
[1:55:42] visions, when God is opening up the
[1:55:45] mysteries of his word to us,
[1:55:48] when God, it's God's day.
[1:55:54] Here's a rose that never will wilt.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; What you're believing is genuine. What
[1:56:01] you're believing is real. Your fighting
[1:56:04] is not in vain.
[1:56:06] your warfare, your struggle.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; It'll soon be over.
[1:56:21] Fight the fight.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; KEEP YOUR WEAPON IN YOUR HAND.
[1:56:36] The king
[1:56:39] is going to reward you someday.
[1:56:43] You have served the king and we've had
[1:56:45] communion with one another before and
[1:56:46] we've we've we love communion times.
[1:56:54] Usually the pastor will serve communion.
[1:57:02] We work hard to get the wine and sister
[1:57:05] Leah makes the bread and
[1:57:08] we It's wonderful time.
[1:57:11] But on that day,
[1:57:15] he ain't going to be asking you to make
[1:57:16] bread.
[1:57:19] And he ain't going to be having the
[1:57:20] deacons to get the wine.
[1:57:23] And there's not going to be servants.
[1:57:25] The Bible says the king
[1:57:28] himself,
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Kevin, the king himself
[1:57:35] will set you down
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; and will serve you.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; The king
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; while the rest of the world is looking
[1:57:47] at this gospel as if it's a myth. And
[1:57:49] you how do we know that they think it's
[1:57:51] a myth? because they don't they don't
[1:57:54] they have changed anything they wanted
[1:57:56] to change out of here.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; They don't believe this Bible is true.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; If they did, they live by
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; women would look like Bible women.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Men would look like Bible men.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Preachers would preach like Bible
[1:58:08] preachers.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; The church would be a Bible church.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; But they've ripped out. Say they don't.
[1:58:15] It's just it's just
[1:58:18] Christianity has become no better than
[1:58:20] Buddha Buddhaism or
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; whatever. It's just I don't know why
[1:58:26] belong to a dead philosophy.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; But Jesus is coming this day to declare
[1:58:34] that he lives that he does know your
[1:58:36] heart.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; That he does know your cries.
[1:58:43] He stood up service after service, city
[1:58:45] after city, nation after nation,
[1:58:49] declaring over and over, I know your
[1:58:51] name. I know your address. I know your
[1:58:53] heart. I know where you come. It was
[1:58:55] God's rose. It was the voice of the
[1:58:57] king. It was a servant from the king
[1:58:59] running with a banner saying, "He
[1:59:01] lives."
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; It was a It was Oh, if I had a flag,
[1:59:04] hallelujah. [laughter] It was It was A
[1:59:07] MESSENGER, OUR PROPHET MESSENGER RUNNING
[1:59:10] WITH THE BANNER. THE [screaming] KING

[2:00:11] home.

[2:00:15] bit weary? Maybe you're some elders

[2:01:11] Oh, people don't understand the battles
[2:01:13] that preachers face. You just don't

[2:08:45] How my savior came [singing]
[2:08:48] from glory.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; How he gave his life
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; to save a rest.
[2:09:01] [music]
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard about
[2:09:06] his groanings.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; I rejoice this morning, Sister
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Karen, when you sung that song. I

[2:09:22] Hallelujah.
[2:09:24] Oh yes.
[2:09:26] Victory
[2:09:28] in Jesus [music]
[2:09:30] my savior [singing]
[2:09:33] forever.
[2:09:35] He sought me
[2:09:38] and he bought me
[2:09:41] with his redeemer.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; He loved me. Yeah.
[2:09:47] [music]
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; I knew him and all my love
[2:09:53] [music and singing]
[2:09:53] is to him.
[2:09:56] He plunged me
[2:09:59] to victory
[2:10:01] beneath.
[2:10:05] WELL, I HEARD about [music] his healing
[2:10:11] of his cleansing power. Reveal it.
[2:10:16] How he made the lame.
[2:10:20] Oh my.
[2:10:22] That's from that other land. He brought
[2:10:25] that from other land.
[2:10:27] [music]
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; I CRY [screaming] TO JESUS.
[2:10:32] Heal my broken spirit. [music]
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[2:10:42] [music]
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; THAT VICTORY ALL TOGETHER. SING IT WITH
[2:10:45] CONVICTION. YES. VICTORY.
[2:10:48] [music]
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; My savior.
[2:10:53] [singing]
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; He sought me.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; HE BOUGHT ME. [music]
[2:11:00] OH YEAH. [screaming]
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; OH, he loved me. Yeah,

[2:11:17] [music]
[2:11:21] He
[2:11:23] love
[2:11:26] you.
[2:11:29] He did not die to make us feel good in
[2:11:32] our minds and [music] we're thankful for
[2:11:33] that. But
[2:11:36] [snorts]
[2:11:38] I hope this message never [music]
[2:11:39] becomes one of those
[2:11:42] I don't want to I don't want this
[2:11:44] message ever swinging [music]
[2:11:46] over into that
[2:11:50] self-improvement
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; that
[2:11:55] think good of yourself and
[2:11:58] inside you is good. You're as worthless
[2:12:00] as worthless can be. And there ain't
[2:12:02] none of you that's any higher than that.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; We're all worthless.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; In this flesh, there [music] is nothing
[2:12:10] good.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; So, we don't need no [music]
[2:12:14] self-improvement.
[2:12:17] We needed salvation.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; And Jesus came [music]
[2:12:22] to redeem us.
[2:12:24] And that soul within this worthless
[2:12:28] being
[2:12:31] is worth [music] 10,000
[2:12:33] of these human worlds.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; All right?
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; All the money, all the wealth, all the
[2:12:40] faith. Put put 10,000 of those worlds.
[2:12:44] Put 10,000 of these globes together
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; and it might start comparing to one
[2:12:50] soul.
[2:12:52] So Jesus came [music]
[2:12:55] not to make life easy.
[2:13:01] There's nothing in this life that is
[2:13:03] that's eternal.
[2:13:06] But what makes life easy
[2:13:09] is having this wonder inside. Brother
[2:13:12] Michael that is saying you come from
[2:13:14] another land.
[2:13:16] Then when you're going [music] when
[2:13:17] you're hurting, when you're sick like
[2:13:20] dad, sick like sisterhu
[2:13:24] Angie. Amen. When you're sick [music]
[2:13:28] like some some of these others, you may
[2:13:30] be fighting.
[2:13:32] Don't matter.
[2:13:34] We're going to believe God.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; God's going to bring us out.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; But God never did promise that we're
[2:13:42] going to live forever here in this
[2:13:44] mortal [music] world. I'm glad that
[2:13:46] there's coming a day when oh glory is
[2:13:48] going to burn.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "I thought you was patriotic."
[2:13:53] My patriotism goes beyond this world
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; to that other kingdom.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I'm about my father's
[2:14:02] business. I come from my father and I'm
[2:14:04] going back to my father and [music] I'm
[2:14:06] coming here for a limited time to get
[2:14:08] all of these earthly get get all these
[2:14:10] eternal beings out of their earthly
[2:14:13] thoughts."
[2:14:15] Yeah.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, victory
[2:14:21] in Jesus
[2:14:24] my savior
[2:14:28] forever.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Forever.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; He sought me. He come to look for me,
[2:14:33] brother Wall-E. And he bought me
[2:14:38] with his
[2:14:40] redeeming [singing]
[2:14:42] blood.
[2:14:44] He
[2:14:46] loved me.
[2:14:48] [singing] I knew him.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, he loved me before

[2:22:37] would so [music] go with us, Lord,
[2:22:41] throughout the day and throughout our
[2:22:44] week
[2:22:47] as we begin to counter [music]
[2:22:49] blessings. Maybe this year, Lord, the
[2:22:52] theme isn't around
[2:22:56] a health and prosperity, which we are
[2:23:00] very [music] thankful for all of that.
[2:23:03] And we definitely don't want to downplay
[2:23:05] that as if it means nothing.
[2:23:09] But Lord, we're looking at our souls and
[2:23:12] that was lost and how good you've been
[2:23:15] to us [music] in our generation.

[2:23:37] at work in our lives.
[2:23:41] We thank you for that.
[2:23:44] We thank you for brotherhood.
[2:23:48] Thank you Lord for all
[2:23:51] of what it means to have friends [music]
[2:23:54] be a part of the family of God.
[2:23:58] We ask Lord that if we've been a little
[2:24:01] bit rough around the edges that you
[2:24:03] would
[2:24:04] help us to take our [music] hiss of our
[2:24:08] common faith and dip it into your blood
[2:24:11] and scrub out all the stains and
[2:24:16] all of the ilk that we have allowed
[2:24:19] crust over our hearts.
[2:24:23] Take every stain [snorts] away from us.
[2:24:27] Let there be a genuine love for you,
[2:24:29] [music] a genuine love for the brothers
[2:24:31] and sisters.
[2:24:34] We thank you for it, Father.
[2:24:37] And Lord, [music] I ask that you would
[2:24:39] move, bless the meal,
[2:24:42] bless those who have provided it. Lord,
[2:24:46] ask Lord that you would [music] cause
[2:24:47] the milk that the mill to be strength to
[2:24:50] our bodies, strength for our souls and
[2:24:54] and we'll give you glory and honor till
[2:24:57] we come back tonight. [music] Lord, just
[2:24:58] keep your hands upon us in Jesus name.
[2:25:04] Amen. Amen.
[2:25:07] As we prepare to dismiss, we would like
[2:25:14] any songs that you might have this
[2:25:16] evening of
[2:25:18] thanksgiving [music] testimonies.
[2:25:23] Think back. Think deep. [music] Think
[2:25:25] back what God's done for you and where
[2:25:28] he's brought your soul.
[2:25:30] If you have a few of those things.

[2:26:14] open, deaf ears unstopped. I believe I'd
[2:26:16] witnessed cancers. I'd seen all of that.
[2:26:19] But this boy
[2:26:23] was in such a [music] confused state.

[2:26:31] clarity. [music]
[2:26:36] It's become it's become my rock.

[2:26:44] miracles since that time.
[2:26:50] But this is my rock.
[2:26:52] this message.
[2:26:55] We say God bless you.
[2:26:58] We let you dismiss yourselves,
[2:27:01] reverence, fear of the Lord.
