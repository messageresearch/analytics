spent half of our life here and um it's uh good to uh good to be back amen and uh we come to uh say hi to Grandpa and Grandma and the family here so it's uh it's been real nice to uh just to relax and visit amen usually we when we come it's usually during the meetings so everyone is busy and we don't have time to just sit down and visit so we uh decided to come and spend a week and um we've really enjoyed it amen un we really appreciate all that you done for us amen if we could turn to the Book of Joshua uh chapter 1 and um it's really good to have my wife and family with me as well amen but uh the Book of Joshua chapter 1 in verse one and we'll read the first three verses it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I have said unto Moses and if we could turn to Matthew amen Matthew 24 we all are familiar with this verse Matthew 24 and verse 35 amen it says um amen Matthew 24:35 see I'm trying to Oh Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away if we could read that one more time Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away way amen we ask the Lord to to bless the reading of the word as you can be seated amen if I were to give a title this morning I would like to to title it uh he is faithful to his word amen and brother brandham says God keeps his word he's got to keep his word in order to be God he has to stand behind everything he said in his word and that's exactly where our faith should rest is a upon is upon the spoken word of God Amen so if we go back and we look at the children of Israel and and and we see that they were in bondage in Egypt and and we know that God had promised them a deliverer amen God had made a covenant with Moses and that he would lead them to a land flowing with milk and honey and no matter how long it took no matter how many years it took and but God was faithful to his word and was able to to perform exactly what he had promised amen he had to call the Flies he had to create the frogs he had to turn water into blood he he had to allow death to come in but he was faithful to his word amen and and after they had uh done seen the glory of God down in Egypt and they seen God move and and perform the Miracles and and they seen all the signs and wonders that God had done and when they seen the pressing time come brother brandham says when the Red Sea had cut them off the deserts had cut them off and Pharaoh's Army was just behind them oh what an hour but God seems to take pleasure in getting his children in such a position amen it's strange how God leads his children so he brings them out of Egypt and now they've come upon the Red Sea and and Pharaoh's Army behind them but God loves to put his children in such a position for them to trust him amen as the poet used to say some through the waters and and some through the flood uh some through deep trials but all through the blood amen God has a way of leading his children amen it's so odd and peculiar amen but God's path happened to lead through the Red Sea amen and brother brandham says how beautiful to notice just in that crucial hour God waits to the very crucial moment H but he can speak and things Heap up according to his word amen he had promised him to take them to the promised land and he's obligated to keep his word amen he was obligated and that great dark crucial moment how easy it was for God to figure it out amen God didn't bring them to the Red Sea and then get all confused he didn't bring them to the Red Sea and go oh my I don't know what I've done I brought you here and Pharaoh's Army is behind you I don't know what to do that's not what God Said Amen God is obligated to keep his word and he says I've got the situation under control amen so what did he do he took the pillar of fire and he moved it over in between the Egyptians coming and it was light to Israel and it was dark to the Egyptians oh my and the Red Sea got scared brother brandham said it got scared and it walled it self up amen it w itself up because God's path LED through the middle of it and that's the way God does things oh my God loves proving himself to his people amen do you believe that amen God loves to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen sometimes as humans we don't we don't understand why we go through certain things we don't understand why God allows us to go through certain trials and and go through the floods and Through the Fire we don't understand sometimes but but we must remember who holds tomorrow in his hands Oh my he promised you will see brighter days and he's obligated to keep his word Amen brother brandham says because these people was keeping his word because the Israel was keeping his word and walking in the light and moving on following God's commands everything just opened up for them and if you want things to open up for you take God at his words and start moving forward amen we get moving forward take God at his word don't look back just press on through he's obligated to be with you oh my walk in the light of his word as he is the light amen now we understand that when they came to the place called Kadesh Baria amen that was the Judgment seat and a testing time for all of Israel amen and God was all God always test his children by his word amen he don't test his children by Theology and by by psychology or nothing he test he tests his children by his word amen and brother Brenham says did you hear that God test his children by his word if you believe his word God test you by the word now if you notice there came a time to go over and and spy out the land amen they they came over and and and it come time they that God brought them through the Red Sea and and and they've wandered around for years but now God brought them to a certain place and it was time to to spy out the land and when they went over to spy out the land they they came back amen we all know the story and and 12 of them and 10 of them says well we can't take it it's impossible we can't can't do it amen because the cities are so wall that we are like grasshoppers in their sight we the Giants are are they're Giants in our eyes they they're huge the walls are just too big for us it's too much for us this trial is just too much for us oh my and numbers uh 13:30 says and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for We Are well able to overcome it amen Caleb and Joshua were looking at one thing and the 10 was looking at something else the 10 was looking at circumstances the 10 was looking at problems and the the 10 was looking at their self ideas and their self motivations but Caleb and Joshua was looking at one thing and that's what God Said Amen God said go and take the land oh my look at what God's word says I don't know how it's going to be done but God said that he would have a church without spot without wrinkle without blemish amen and I believe he's going to have it amen I believe he's going to have a bride ready for a Rapture oh my he's going to have it you got to believe it it's not up to us to know how God is going to do it amen amen we just got to believe that he will do it amen he'll part the waters if he has to amen just know that he's faithful to his word amen he said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen he has proven his word over and over again amen and it's never failed not one time amen his word has with stod the test of time and for over 2,000 years he's proven his word over and over again and never once has it return void amen I've I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed of begging for bread oh my cuz he is faithful to his word he was faithful to Moses he was faithful to Abraham he was faithful to Noah he was faithful to Paul and Martin he was faithful to Luther and Wesley he was faithful to William bradam and he is faithful to his word concerning you hallu no matter what you go through today he is faithful to keep his word heyen it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God is true to to his promise amen no matter what he has to do he will bankrupt heaven and and he'll Bank he'll Bank bankrupt Heaven before he will let his word go defeated oh my a man he never made a promise that he can't keep amen I am the Lord that heals all your diseases amen if they lay hands on the sick they shall not might they shall recover oh if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that believeth amen that's one thing that God can do is keep his word amen and that's the God we serve this morning amen the world is trying to uh uh to find God in an Easter Bunny oh come on now they're trying to find God in a Santa Claus they're trying to they're trying to find God in their own Creeds and their own traditions and their own ideas they're trying to introduce uh the people to a god through rituals and good works and it's only binding the people it's only blinding the people from the true word of God Amen but let me say this this message has come to introduce us to Jesus Christ we're not confused this morning we know who we are this morning amen and my God he doesn't need an introduction this morning morning we all have experienced the mercies of the Lord amen but let me say this this message has come and it's come to give us life amen I serve a God who Reigns Victorious a God who has never lost a battle amen a God that's done the impossible Time After Time amen he has the power to break every chain he has the power to men the broken heart I serve a God who is always willing forever will be amen he will never leave me nor forsake me amen though I walk through the valley and the shadow of Le OA I will fear no evil for thou art with me amen he's obligated to keep his word he is faithful this morning oh bless amen and I

I've never seen the righteous forsaken this morning amen he's here in our midst this morning he's here to meet your every need this morning amen he is faithful to his word amen people put him off as a god of History they put him off as a God that once was amen and other people are crying out where's the god where's the god that calling the Red Sea where's the god that that that that that that

a people can stand here and say he is here he is here this morning amen I don't have to look in theology I don't have to look at Creeds and and traditions amen he is here in his word this morning ministering to your hearts amen the world can't see it but God has an elected little group here in Pon okl who has recognize that it's Jesus Christ made flesh once again and a Min member body oh my performing signs and wonders oh my hallelujah hallelujah now remember God gave them the land down in Egypt and he said that land is yours every bit of that land is yours as I have said to Moses I made a promise with Moses amen and I'm going to keep my word as I have said to Moses that land is yours go possess it amen now the people today are expecting God to reach down brother Bram says and get them by the neck and say you bring me out clean me off heal me and I'll believe you but God doesn't do his business that way he gives you the promise but you have to go fight for every inch of ground that you possess amen why didn't God go over there and just run the amorites out why didn't God just go down there and run the Hittites and the parasites out amen and all of them why didn't he just run them out no Israel had something to do and you've got something to do God said the land is yours go and possess it amen they had to fight for every inch of their way but they had that assurance that it was given to them and no matter what the results are no matter what the circumstances look like it would belong to them it was theirs amen God gave it to them and they looked at the promise instead of the circumstance oh my and if we could only do that this morning don't look at your problems don't look at your circumstances amen look to the promise this morning amen if if we could just look to the promise healing is yours salvation is yours the Holy Ghost is yours Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call you see the Promise is just as real today as it was then amen it's your possession if you'll go take it amen it's been given to you oh my amen glory huah Heen if God calls you he intends for you to have it if God called you to it he intends for you to have it amen but you'll have to fight every inch of the way oh sometimes we wonder God why don't you just do this for me why he intends for you to fight for it amen now there re remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance and Joshua said unto the children of Israel how long how long are you slacked to go possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath given you oh my how long are you going to be slack and going and possessing your promise the Lord's giving it to you why are you just sitting down oh my amen if we could say the same today you've been on that mountain long enough oh my you've been in you God's called you out of Egypt he's called you he's brought you this far he's brought you that far why are you just sitting there oh come on it's time we possess it amen his path will lead you through the fire his path will lead you through the flood through the hard times through bad times but he's promised you you would come out on the other side and he's faithful to perform his word he's faithful to promise uh to fulfill the promise he has promised you amen just as God gave Israel a pillar of cloud by day and a killer of Fire by night and lead them to the promised land so has he in this day given us a confirmation that his word Remains the Same amen he appeared in a cloud on Sunset mountain and he had the picture taken with the prophet in the form of a pillar of fire to confirm that this message we are following is going to take us to that new land oh my oh this message is getting us ready for a rapture it's getting us ready to meet him in the air amen the world will laugh at you the world will call you a fanatic but we have that assurance that if God made the promise he is faithful to fulfill it Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away excuse me Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will never fail hey man you've been sitting on that mountain long enough you've been sitting on pain long enough you've been sitting on heartbreak long enough you've been sitting on depression long enough amen It's Time For That Mountain to come down it's time for depression to come down it's time for heartbreak to come down it's time for complexes to come down Oh my Jesus said I will be with you even in you till the end of the world God has given you the power and the authority to overcome amen it would be easy for God just to wave a little wand it'd be easy for God just to come down and just wave our trials away and wave our our troubles away but this is no fairy tale God has given us a promise and we must we must G up our lines and we must go possess it oh my it's not God's provided way just to come and and watch everything disappear before our eyes oh we would love to amen but God has given us that same Authority that Christ had and that is speak to your Mountain speak to your situation speak for your children speak for your spouse speak whatever you have need of come boldly before the throne of grace and he will give it to you amen it's got to come to pass cuz God is faithful God never leaves a prayer unanswered you say you may say well brother Daniel I I've been praying for years and nothing has happened amen I've been praying for years and I know Grandpa we've been praying for years for Grandpa and it may seem like he's only getting worse but see that's the devil he likes to attack our minds he likes to attack and try to get us focused on the situation and get us focused on the problems amen but look at Daniel Daniel Prayed and the angel of the Lord heard Daniel but he couldn't get to Daniel for 21 days and Daniel didn't give up praying after one day he didn't give up praying after seven days he didn't get up give up praying after 14 days but he kept pressing he kept going he kept believing and the angel said I'm here Daniel I'm here to meet your need glory to God Don't Stop Believing this morning don't stop pressing don't stop amen even for your children amen Satan is fighting tooth and now amen he is trying to get us to doubt and and trying to tell us that our prayers are going to go unanswered but I serve a God who cannot fail Jeremiah 32:27 says behold I am the Lord the God of All Flesh is there anything to hard for me brother Kobe is there anything too hard for me is there anything Church ponies or anything too hard for the Lord this morning brother brandom says you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way he does don't never think that you can never or that you could ever ask too much of God I believe the scripture says you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys would be full amen he wants you to ask abundantly brother bam says ask for big things ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little Mustard Seed get out here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things big things is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all and you got faith just know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it right to work and you'll be just fine amen we don't have to be scared we don't have to fear tomorrow just believe what God has given you amen you may go through the Lion's Den but he is faithful to shut the mouths of lions amen you may go through the waters but he is faithful to part the waters you may go through the fiery fers but he will be faithful to be with you through the fire amen that's a promise this morning 1st Samuel 12:22 says for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great Nam sake amen I love this part because it pleased the Lord to make you his people amen for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake because if please the Lord to make you his people and we as humans fail and come up short every day yet it's still pleased the Lord to make you his people amen why because uh before the world was ever formed he had you in his mind as holy as pure as he is without spot without wrinkle tested and tried and come forth as pure gold amen you say well I don't think I can handle the pain any longer I don't know if I can go on I I've lost this I've lost that oh let's look at job this morning amen job had lost his livestock job has lost his farm he had lost his children and his own wife said job why don't you just Curse God and die but job said but he is faithful I've lost my children but he's faithful I've lost my livestock but he's faithful amen you can say what you want to say but he is faithful this morning amen though my body is suffering in pain he is faithful to his word amen why could job stand there and say that why could job stand there and say through everything that he went through through all the problems he faced to losing his own children how job how could job stand there and say that because his experience with God was much stronger than his circumstances oh my his experience with God was much stronger than the situation he was in amen and I believe that there's a church who's experience the mercies of the Lord and Satan is going to fight toothing now to get you down but your but your experience is stronger than the circumstance this morning amen don't let your circumstance override your experience with God if he's healed you one time he'll heal you again amen if he's saved one time he'll do it again if he's filled with the Holy Ghost one time he's going to do it again if he's mended the broken heart before he's going to do it again why because he is Faithful over his word concerning you amen John 10:27 says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand and my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is a able to pluck them out of my father's hand oh my that infinite God who knows the end from the beginning who carved the mountains out with his own hands he threw out the Stars he knew exactly where they would land he created the Milky Way he created the universe that science can't even comprehend and he holds you in the palm of his hands this morning don't fear don't fear he's holding you in the pal of his hand Hallelujah and he won't lose a one he's faithful to his worth this morning he can't lose a one amen God created the lion and he created the little lamb he created the elephants and the deer on down to the ants on down to the ladybugs yet nothing could resemble nothing resembled the Creator but then one day one day there come a man walking through the garden God had created a being after his own image and when God would speak he would speak back when God walked man was there beside him walking with God Amen and and God a man of Perfect Harmony a perfect reflection of who God was brother brers had God created miniature Gods amen and we know the first hadam fell and it caused a separation between God and the man but God made a promise that he would redeem man back to himself amen he didn't want to leave you there in the muck and the M but he said I will redeem man back to myself and see God couldn't use man again for this work God had to come himself in the form of a man am man he was born of a virgin he had to be burped he had he had to have his diaper change he he had to learn how to walk he had to learn how to talk amen Jesus had to go through his teens and he was tempted in every way that we was he was tempted by women he was tempted by money he was tempted by popularity and you might say this morning well God just don't understand the things we go through come on now if you have a question in your heart this morning they're saying God does not understand what we go through amen that's the devil telling you that God knows the things that we go through amen and you might say well I I just don't understand and and I just don't know he knows exactly what we go through he knows the pain he knows the hurt he knows was it what it's like to be rejected he knows what it's like to be left alone well prayed and I prayed and nothing has happened well maybe he's just forsaken me but don't give up Don't Stop Believing he is faithful to his word amen if he knows every fly that way every flea that would be on this Earth and every net and how many times it would bad it high if he holds the sparrow in flight this morning how much more does he care for you amen a bride that's re been redeemed by his own blood oh my and he holds you in the palm of his hand amen every situation you go through every battle you go through every heartache you go through every just depression you go through god holds in the palm of his hand and he won't lose a wine amen can you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise Hall he said he would not lose a one of his children and he is faithful to his word 1 Corinthians 10 taken you but such as come faithful above that you are able oh I just love that sometimes we go through the trials and we just think that this trial is too much for us and we just think that oh we don't know what we're going to do and we're just going through one trial after another to go in despair but he says that he will not give you more than anything that more than you are able to Bear amen but with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it amen he didn't put you through a trial to leave you there he didn't put you through a situation without making uh without making a way of Escape amen if he put you through it or in it he's got to get you through it amen for he is faithful amen you're going uh you're going to go through the trials you're going to go through testing times but he is faithful to make a way of Escape amen he knew you couldn't make it on your own he knew you couldn't do it by yourself so he says I will be in you and with you to the end of the world amen so what did he do he made a covenant he knew you couldn't make it on your own he knew that you would need him to go through this so what did he do he made a covenant that he will be with you even in you Jesus said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee and he is standing Among Us this morning alive and vindicating his promise this morning amen possess the promise the promis is unto you and your children to them that are far off many as our Lord shall call amen just come boldly before the throne of grace and ask what you will and it will be given to you why because he is faithful to his word amen you don't have to fear tomorrow you don't have to fear the Giants but just stand on the word of God for no weapon form against the shall prosper if God before me who can stand against me amen I Won't Be Shaken I won't be moved amen for my God is faithful and his promise is true this morning amen there's no mountain too high there's no problem too big there's no weapon too strong amen Satan you're defeated this morning Satan you're defeated this morning amen we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is

said oh death oh where is your sting show me where you can make me squ and scream grave where is your Victory and you and you think you can mold me out there while I'll point you to an empty one over there and I am in him and he'll raise me up in the last day a defeated enemy we are fighting a defeated enemy this morning Satan has no hold on you young people Satan has no hold on you he is faithful

and heartaches but God was faithful hey man you should be fighting depression this morning but he was faithful you should be fighting complexes and anxiety but he was faithful you should be fighing bad Health this morning but he was faithful to his word concerning you and as long as you're believing and staying true to this word he will stay faithful as long as you stay faithful as long as you stay true to the promise of God he will stay faithful to his word amen amen I remember uh last year uh a couple months ago la last year uh I went to the doctor for a uh due to a fo wreck I know some of the family may remember and um I I went up this hill and and uh the brakes didn't work and and I stopped I stopped on this heel because there was thorns and I stopped to brush them aside well the brakes didn't hold and the four-wheeler started going backwards and then this hill was Steep and excuse me I uh I uh downshifted on it and it still wouldn't stop I downshifted again and it went to neutral and it just went even faster down and I couldn't get it out of the gear and all I just remember was just holding on and and I would just closed my eyes and and I didn't I didn't know it was dark it was dark outside and I didn't know what what was the drop off had a it was a mountain on the side so I was on this Trail and it was just drop off on one side and and I just closed my eyes and hung on and I and I turned it real sharp to let the fo wheer fall because I didn't want to go over that mountain and and the fourwheeler landed on top of me and then just rolled down and it scared me so bad my father-in-law was on the next Ridge over and I called him and he rushed over and and he's like are you okay well I I got up and I I didn't feel anything I I I was like I I thought for sure I would crush something would have broke something and and and but God was faithful and and we went to uh and a couple day later or the same day I just had a small uh pain in my in my lower back and we had gone to get it checked out and and the doctor began to ask me a series of questions and the doctors anytime you go they start asking you a bunch of questions and I was sitting there on the bed and she began to say Daniel do you smoke I said said no ma'am she says do you drink and I said no ma'am do you do drugs no ma'am do you have any heart problems no ma'am are you a diabetic no ma'am do you have this problem no ma'am do you have that problem no ma'am I don't and as I begin to hear these questions and answer them back I was sitting on the edge of the bed God and A Tear come out of my eye and and I couldn't help but just think how faithful God has been to me that he's kept me and he's kept my family he kept me safe on that mountain oh I I should have been I should have been dead or crippled or that that fourwheeler landed on top of me but God had his angels round about me and he was faithful to his word that he would not leave me nor forsake me oh my Lord You've surely been good to me amen and if we had time this morning I know we could all take a mic and stand up here and we could spend all day and testify how faithful God has been to his word amen all world this world is getting darker this world is looking Bleak and and the future looks rough it looks like darkness is ahead it looks like all is hopeless with all the bombings with with all the shootings and the hurricanes and the fires and the floods everything just looks hopeless to us and it seems like it will never end and and and people are trying to find a reason to be happy and all of this they're trying to find a reason to smile amen but we as the Bride of Jesus Christ can lift our heads without without doubt cuz we know who we are we know where we come from and we know where we're going we're

the Lord Lord I'm going to backslide but before I do I want to give you thanks first you've been good to me so before I go away I just want to say thank you for what you've done for me and she began to think the Lord out loud she says Lord I remember that time I didn't have enough money to pay the bills and I cried out to you and you were faithful to me my need thank you Lord and Lord I remember that time I was sick and the doctors have given up hope but Lord you moved on the scene and you healed my body thank you Lord and I remember when my son was burning up with a fever and I didn't know

supper that night but Lord you provided for us and as she began to go through each testimony of of the faithfulness of God she finally stopped and said Lord Lord you've been so good to me you've been so faithful to me I can't give up now I can't give up now Lord you brought me this far and you're going to take me all the way amen you provided time and time again you part of the waters for me you C

and God become at one I was thinking of as I was listening this morning um to a message my new min history and and and brother Brandon was talking about sister Hattie right and and and how she had to come and she had to come into agreement with the word and and so he was you know he says I I I said that same Jehovah gy is trying to get his promise over to me in my thickness and dullness of mind he could speak my need into existence the same as he could speak Abraham's need into existence and I no more than said that and sister hadie sitting there crying now hadn't said a word and suddenly she said there's that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing she she said just like Banks down there I I heard her voice as it swept from my ears like up into the woods now he says and it says and that super an anointing swept over me and said tell Hattie that she's found Grace in the sight of God and he said who would have thought that's the that's the question who would have thought that that would happen and and and and he says now here stands Hattie right or sister Hattie there's the little widow woman that the miracle happened on the first bypassing all the peoples of the world and and for that thing to happen to that first to that poor little humble widow woman up on a hillside up there trying to raise corn out of crawfish ground out there and to take care of her children that's the one that God honored and and he says said I challenge anybody in the name of the Lord when that Spirit strikes and says that I don't care what you ask for it shall be done you know why the plut PRS didn't get it or or the big folks like that is because God knowed that asked things that was no good for them he gives it to people who he knows will ask the right things oh let me just come in agreement with that word Lord let me ask the right thing can you say man he says she could ask whatever she wanted but her desire was for the Salvation of her children my he he says but God knows what you're going to ask before he ever places the anointing upon you oh I just say Lord I'm just I'm just going to I'm just going to stay right there with your word I'm going to come in line with
