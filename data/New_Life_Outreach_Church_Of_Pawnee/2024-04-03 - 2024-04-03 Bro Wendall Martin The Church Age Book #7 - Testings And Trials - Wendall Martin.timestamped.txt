[28:15] introduction here we've already read um
[28:18] the verses so let's let's do um uh 110
[28:22] and then paragraph one or uh two here
[28:26] says in order to refresh your mind I
[28:28] want to point out again how we arrive at
[28:31] finding the names of The Messengers to
[28:34] the various ages God in his Sovereign
[28:37] will has seen to it that the history of
[28:40] the New Testament Church was not lost
[28:43] even as he saw to it that the history of
[28:45] Israel would not be lost by placing it
[28:48] in the Bible and
[28:50] corroborating it uh today from the
[28:53] multitude of scows Earth and vessels and
[28:57] uh other artifacts that the
[28:59] archaeologists have discovered and
[29:02] interpreted we actually have a running
[29:04] commentary of Bible history from the
[29:07] first page up to now thus by reading
[29:10] history we can find out what man or men
[29:15] in various Ages were closest to God's
[29:18] original pattern the Apostle Paul so
[29:21] everything is everything in every age we
[29:24] we we it's you you you judge everything
[29:27] according to that first church age
[29:29] messenger brother Brenham says he will
[29:31] never change can you say amen he says
[29:35] the ones that God used to bring his
[29:37] people back to the word of truth would
[29:39] be the ones to examine then out of those
[29:43] there would be uh one for every age who
[29:47] would stand out the clearest as the
[29:49] closest in the word pattern and power
[29:52] and that would and that one would be the
[29:54] messenger the ages are found by a study
[29:57] of history
[29:59] one simply needs to read the ages as
[30:01] found in
[30:03] Revelations Revelation and it all
[30:06] patterns perfectly with history as
[30:08] indeed it must since the church Ages
[30:11] were foretold by God and their
[30:14] conditions revealed then of necessity
[30:18] the history would follow uh that would
[30:21] follow would be as the Bible sets forth
[30:24] it is that simple but then Simplicity is
[30:27] the key to the word I like that amen I
[30:30] like that now with all this I have not
[30:33] simply been a student and a historian I
[30:36] have sought to be Spirit a spiritually
[30:39] minded man and it was only with the
[30:42] Divine approval of the spirit of God
[30:44] that I chose the men that I have
[30:47] chosen that is true as God knows my
[30:50] heart now again there's a lot of people
[30:53] that talk about amen the the ages and
[30:56] and and brother brandom was not the
[30:59] first to bring out the Seven Ages the
[31:02] scoffield uh uh Bible talks about The
[31:06] Seven Ages the uh even your your
[31:08] Thompson Chain Bibles uh talk about The
[31:11] Seven Ages so so this is not just a a
[31:15] theory that there these seven churches
[31:18] that we have went and at length over in
[31:21] the past is is um is has been talking
[31:26] about the um The Seven Ages so it's
[31:29] seven distinct periods of time but but
[31:33] the the deal is it took that seventh
[31:37] angel messenger remember in the days of
[31:40] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[31:44] shall begin to sound the mystery of the
[31:47] Book of Revelation will all be finished
[31:51] amen now and it doesn't just it doesn't
[31:53] just include Revelation because we find
[31:56] out amen that symbols uh was carried
[31:59] through all throughout the Bible so this
[32:02] seventh angel messenger amen is to bring
[32:05] to Front The Mystery of God for that
[32:08] church that God is doing can you say
[32:11] Amen someone says well he didn't you
[32:14] know he must not be the prophet because
[32:16] he didn't really talk about what the
[32:18] Jews and what's going to happen in the
[32:19] tribulation well that doesn't pertain to
[32:22] you that doesn't pertain to the bride
[32:25] amen God would we're we're thankful for
[32:27] what that what we did get but I'm here
[32:29] to tell you what you needed God's given
[32:32] to us in this
[32:34] generation can you say amen and so um so
[32:38] we're we're thankful for so it it when
[32:41] brother Bram says he had the definite
[32:43] approval of the spirit of God when the
[32:46] prophet says that perk your ears up
[32:49] because God has put his SK of approval
[32:52] and told him this is your man amen amen
[32:56] so now we're going to talk about the
[32:57] message messenger it says using our
[32:59] god-given rule of choosing the messenger
[33:01] for each Age We
[33:04] unhesitantly declare that irenius was
[33:07] exalted by the Lord to that
[33:10] position he was the disciple of that
[33:13] great Saint and Warrior of the faith
[33:15] polycarp it is no doubt as he sat at the
[33:19] feet of that great man he learned the
[33:21] Christian Graces that flowed from his
[33:23] consecrated life for polycarp was one of
[33:27] the truly illustrious Saints of all ages
[33:29] when viewed in the light of a blameless
[33:32] life you will remember from your own
[33:34] reading that poly clar was martyred too
[33:37] old to flee too sincere a man to allow
[33:40] another to hide him and then suffer a
[33:42] penalty for doing so he gave himself up
[33:45] to death but before he did he asked for
[33:49] and was granted permission to pray two
[33:51] hours for his brethren in the Lord for
[33:53] the governor for his enemies and his
[33:56] captors
[33:58] like the great Saints of all ages and
[34:00] Desiring a better Resurrection he stood
[34:03] firm refusing to deny the Lord and died
[34:06] with a free conscience he was placed at
[34:09] the stake untied at his own request and
[34:12] the fire was lit the fire bent away from
[34:16] his body refusing to touch him he was
[34:19] then pierced through with a sword and as
[34:22] this was done water gushed from his side
[34:25] drowning the Flames his spirit was
[34:28] actually seen to depart in the form of a
[34:31] white dove released from his bosom
[34:34] wow yet for all this great testimony
[34:38] this student of John the Revelator was
[34:41] not militant against the nickan system
[34:44] for he himself leaned toward
[34:47] organization not realizing that the
[34:49] desire for uh
[34:52] fellowship and what appeared like a good
[34:54] plan to Foster the work of God was
[34:57] really a trick of the enemy with irus
[35:00] this was not so he was militant against
[35:03] any form of
[35:05] organization also his life history
[35:08] wherein he served the Lord was one of
[35:11] much manifestation in the spirit and the
[35:14] Word was taught with unusual Clarity and
[35:17] Conformity to its original precepts his
[35:21] churches in France were known to have
[35:23] the gifts of the Spirit among them for
[35:26] the Saints spoke in tongues prophesied
[35:29] raised the dead healed the Sick by the
[35:32] prayer of faith he saw the danger of any
[35:36] kind of organized Brotherhood among the
[35:38] elders pastors Etc he stood solidly for
[35:42] a unified Spirit-filled gift manifesting
[35:47] local church and God honored him for the
[35:50] power of God manifested among the saints
[35:53] now you're going to notice this all
[35:55] through these every one of these ages
[35:57] every one of these Messengers stood uh
[36:01] firm for the nine spiritual gifts stood
[36:05] firm for the five uh uh uh for the
[36:08] five-fold ministry they stood firm for
[36:12] God working in the church they were
[36:15] against the format that that there was
[36:18] just a a a a a spiritual man a priest or
[36:22] some holy man that was taken care of all
[36:24] the worship God gave gifts to every
[36:28] member in that church that's why we've
[36:32] got to be baptized into that body
[36:34] because you cannot operate effectively
[36:38] in that local body without being
[36:40] baptized with the Holy Ghost amen if not
[36:44] it's just constantly looking at this one
[36:46] looking at that one and it's just all
[36:48] power struggles whereas where the Holy
[36:50] Spirit comes in and is living his life
[36:54] you are baptized into God's Eternal
[36:58] purpose for for every one of us and so I
[37:02] I think this is very important you're
[37:04] going to notice as we look at each one
[37:05] of these ages they all they they all
[37:09] fought for the spirit of God not
[37:13] intellectualism the spirit of God in
[37:16] their churches can you say amen and so
[37:20] uh and and by the way on polycarp um you
[37:23] can you can look polycarp's testimony up
[37:26] uh online the fox book of Martyrs has an
[37:29] incredible uh that's that's quite that's
[37:33] that's quite a testimony and uh if you
[37:35] guys want to read it there's there's
[37:36] there's a lot um brother bam just took a
[37:39] some pieces out of that but uh and if
[37:41] you've got the fox's book of martyr
[37:43] which I do um there's it's just
[37:46] incredible what those early Saints done
[37:48] so those that want to read on further on
[37:50] that all right let's go on he was also
[37:53] clear on his understanding of the
[37:55] godhead and since he was the disciple of
[37:58] polycarp who in turn was the disciple of
[38:00] St John we know for sure he was as
[38:05] perfect uh he was he had as perfect
[38:08] teaching as is possible on this subject
[38:10] in volume 1 page 412 the antien fathers
[38:15] we have this statement by him on the
[38:17] godhead all the other Expressions
[38:20] likewise bring out the title of one the
[38:23] same being the one and the same being
[38:25] the Lord of power the Lord the power or
[38:27] the father of all God Almighty most high
[38:32] Creator maker such like these are not
[38:36] the names and the titles of su uh
[38:40] succession of different beings but of
[38:42] one and of the same he pointed out
[38:45] clearly that these are not these are but
[38:48] titles as is Rose of Sharon Bright and
[38:51] Morning Star fairest of 10,000 Etc there
[38:55] is uh neither is there but one God his
[38:58] name is Lord Jesus
[39:01] Christ thus with his strict adherence to
[39:04] the word his wonderful understanding of
[39:06] scripture and the attendance of the
[39:08] power of God upon that Ministry he is
[39:12] the right choice for the age it is it is
[39:15] altogether unfortunate that the other
[39:18] ages did not have in their Messengers
[39:20] such a balance of fruit power and
[39:22] leadership in the Holy Spirit and the
[39:25] word now we're going to move going to
[39:27] Smyrna and it says the City of Smyrna
[39:30] was a little uh north of Ephesus at the
[39:33] mouth of Smyrna
[39:35] Gulf because of its very fine Harbor It
[39:38] was a commercial center renowned for its
[39:40] exports it was also distinguished for
[39:43] its schools of rhetoric philosophy
[39:46] medicine sciences and fine buildings
[39:50] many Jews lived there and they were
[39:52] bitly opposed to Christianity even more
[39:56] so than were the Romans in fact polycarp
[39:59] the First bishop at Smyrna was martyred
[40:03] by the Jews and it is said that the Jews
[40:05] desecrated their holy day Saturday to
[40:09] carry the wood that would make this uh
[40:12] his funeral peer the word Samina means
[40:16] bitter being derived from the word uh M
[40:21] or myrr myrr was used in AB bombing the
[40:25] dead thus we have two fold significance
[40:28] found in the name of this age it was a
[40:31] bitter age filled with death the two
[40:34] Vines within the framework of the church
[40:35] were drifting further apart with an
[40:38] increased bitterness toward the True
[40:40] Vine on the part of the false death was
[40:43] not the only seed of the false Vine but
[40:47] even in the True Vine there was a
[40:50] creeping peris uh per perisis amen sorry
[40:56] and impotent
[40:58] uh because they had already drifted from
[41:00] the unadulterated truth of the first few
[41:03] years after
[41:05] Pentecost and no True Believer is any
[41:09] stronger and spiritually healthy and
[41:11] Alive than his knowledge of and
[41:14] adherence to the pure word of God as
[41:17] seen by the multitudes of examples in
[41:20] the Old Testament organization was
[41:22] growing a pace confirming and augmenting
[41:25] the death of the membership
[41:28] the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost
[41:29] leadership was deposed and the Word was
[41:31] replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made
[41:34] rituals when Israel entered into lawful
[41:37] alliances with the world and formed
[41:39] fellowships by marriage the day finally
[41:42] came when the world took over and
[41:45] Babylon carried away the people of God
[41:46] into captivity now when they went into
[41:50] captivity they went in having a
[41:52] priesthood a temple and the word when
[41:56] they came back back they had rabbis a
[41:59] theological order of the Pharisees a
[42:01] synagogue and the
[42:04] tomman and when Jesus came they were so
[42:07] corrupted that he called them of their
[42:09] father the devil and this in spite of
[42:13] the fact they were of Abraham according
[42:16] to the Flesh in this age we see the same
[42:19] thing happening however as all Israel is
[42:23] not Israel but a little group were the
[42:26] true spirit spiritual Israelites so
[42:29] there would be always there would always
[42:31] be a little group of true Christians the
[42:34] bride of Christ until he came for his
[42:37] own well
[42:40] Hallelujah he says in this city there
[42:42] were two famous temples one was the
[42:45] temple erected to the worship of Zeus
[42:48] and the other erected Sabel to Sabel and
[42:52] between these two temples was found the
[42:55] most beautiful Road of ancient times
[42:57] called the Golden City to me this
[43:00] depicts a a further inroad of paganism
[43:03] that had already started in the first
[43:05] age but was known to exist only at Rome
[43:09] the joining of the two temples of a god
[43:11] and goddess is seed for
[43:16] marity uh wherein Mary is called the
[43:19] mother of God and receives honor and
[43:21] titles and powers given her a quo
[43:25] equality with Jesus Christ
[43:28] the golden street that joins them is a
[43:30] picture of the greed that caused the
[43:33] nickan organizers to join the state and
[43:36] the church because they knew the wealth
[43:39] and the power it offered them as the
[43:42] Ephesian age was but the seed
[43:45] bed uh for the tragic pergam Manan age
[43:49] it that was uh yet in the future this
[43:52] Myan age was the rain the sun and the
[43:56] nourishment that ensured the vile
[43:58] corruption that would confirm the church
[44:01] in idolatry with the spiritual
[44:03] fornication uh from which she would
[44:06] never rise death was permeating her root
[44:09] to the branch and they that took part of
[44:12] her partook of bitterness and death this
[44:17] age lasted 170 to 312
[44:21] ad amen so so we can we can see here the
[44:26] the it's all laid out brother brandham
[44:28] is is is giving us what uh these two
[44:32] temples the marrying the two together
[44:35] and how that they they in turn that's
[44:38] exactly what Rome done but he took the
[44:42] Son of God and his mother and bringing
[44:45] them both together so it would be son
[44:48] and mother worship just as these others
[44:51] were amen and so in anytime that you
[44:54] replace the word of God for for for
[44:57] these kinds of things then you
[45:00] are then then you are uh effectively
[45:04] killing your own your your own uh your
[45:08] own life amen you cannot cannot you
[45:12] cannot take anything a even a a small
[45:16] portion of God's word amen and add yours
[45:19] to it it just won't mix you can't mix it
[45:23] and that's the reason why we had to have
[45:25] that word brought to us Prophet had to
[45:27] come amen and and and this is where I I
[45:31] think the bride should just really amen
[45:34] we we we have we've we've got to leave
[45:38] our Pride born you've got to be born
[45:41] again a born again you're it's no you
[45:44] you're no longer uh the pride issue is
[45:47] gone because you can't follow Christ and
[45:51] your own will you cannot do that it's it
[45:55] the your your mind is enmity against God
[45:59] and and and you you young men and young
[46:02] women how important it is don't try to
[46:06] figure things out don't try to find you
[46:09] know the minimum of God's word but ask
[46:13] God let me die to
[46:15] myself and be born of you so that I can
[46:19] not just uh uh that I not just
[46:23] understand your teachings but help me to
[46:25] surrender myself to your teachings
[46:29] because you're going to surrender to one
[46:30] or another and you can't it's the most
[46:32] it's it's the most miserable life amen
[46:35] Still Still Alive In the Flesh and at
[46:38] the same time trying to to to walk
[46:42] according to God it's just it's it's
[46:44] just a it's it's torment but we must die
[46:47] to ourselves our thinking our I've got
[46:51] to die to this old nature so that the
[46:54] Life of Christ can live in me can you
[46:57] say amen amen and so um so I think I
[47:01] think in in all of this oh God oh God
[47:04] help wend Martin help wend Martin to to
[47:08] totally surrender myself and every as we
[47:11] reading this you're going to hear that
[47:12] in brother bram's thoughts amen it slips
[47:15] in so easy so slightly it slips in amen
[47:21] and so we we want to uh keep those
[47:24] things in our mind now let's go ahead
[47:27] and continue reading this is the uh
[47:30] salutation and and he's taking it there
[47:32] from uh Revelations 2 and8 he says and
[47:36] these things saith the first and the
[47:37] last which was dead and is alive the
[47:42] first and the last which was dead and is
[47:44] alive now these are not the words of a
[47:47] man a m man could he speak from the
[47:50] grave would say I am the first and the
[47:53] last which was alive and is dead
[47:57] the first thing that happens to a
[48:00] man is that he is born he is alive and
[48:05] the last thing that happens is that he
[48:07] dies so this is not a man speaking this
[48:11] is deity man Adam took life and turned
[48:15] it into death but this man Jesus Took
[48:18] death and turned it into life Adam took
[48:22] innocence and turned it into guilt this
[48:25] one took guilt and turned it into
[48:28] righteousness Adam took a paradise and
[48:31] turned it into a waste hiling Wilderness
[48:34] but this one is coming back to turn an
[48:37] earth rocking and reeling with
[48:39] destruction into another Eden Hallelujah
[48:43] Adam took life of fellowship and joy
[48:46] with God and turned it into a desert of
[48:49] spiritual darkness and that brought
[48:51] forth all sin moral Decay pain suffering
[48:57] delusion corruption that Wars within the
[49:00] souls of men but this one from all the
[49:03] tragic death and degradation that filled
[49:07] mankind brought forth a life of
[49:10] righteousness and Beauty so that as Sin
[49:13] once reigned unto death even so men now
[49:17] reign in righteousness by one Jesus
[49:21] Christ oh isn't that just wonderful it's
[49:24] it's you know uh uh uh it it should
[49:28] there should be just be a real cry in
[49:30] our heart Lord oh I want to die more I
[49:33] want to surrender more I want you to
[49:36] take me I want your life to be so
[49:39] overwhelming in my life I believe I
[49:42] believe it's possible folks but the only
[49:44] way you're going to do it is dying amen
[49:46] you're going to have to die and and and
[49:49] when you die oh that's when the
[49:52] resurrection of the new life can come
[49:54] can you say Amen it says now not as the
[49:57] offense was though terrible indeed it
[50:00] was but now much more is his gift unto
[50:04] eternal life here he is walking in the
[50:08] midst of Those whom he has redeemed even
[50:11] his church what were those who he
[50:14] redeemed uh who were redeemed were not
[50:17] many like Paul murderers and corruptors
[50:20] were not many like the dying Thief
[50:23] robbers and
[50:24] mankillers all trophies of his grace all
[50:28] brought back from the dead all made
[50:31] alive in Christ Jesus the Lord he said I
[50:34] wonder if you noted the salutation to
[50:36] the first age and then noted the one of
[50:39] to this age put them together these
[50:42] things saith he that holdeth the Seven
[50:44] Stars in his right hand and walks in the
[50:47] midst of the churches these things saith
[50:50] the first and the last which was dead
[50:52] and is alive this is one and the same
[50:56] person
[50:57] he is letting us know that the churches
[50:59] is as the seed of the fruit is in the
[51:02] midst of the fruit so is he the Royal
[51:05] seed in the midst of the church as the
[51:08] seed alone has life in it so is he the
[51:13] author of life to that church his
[51:16] walking signifies his untiring care of
[51:19] it he is the chief Shepherd watching
[51:22] over his own that is right for he bought
[51:25] that church with his own blood that
[51:28] blood is the blood of God the one who
[51:31] owns the church is God very God he is
[51:35] the very he is the first and the last
[51:37] the title spells eternity he was dead
[51:40] and is alive he paid the price so he has
[51:44] so ownership of the temple of God he
[51:48] rules it he has worshiped in it he
[51:51] resents anyone taking over his lordship
[51:54] and Authority No Doubt the reason he
[51:57] introduces himself to each age as deity
[52:00] is to warn and comfort the people he
[52:03] warns the false Vine he Comforts The
[52:06] True Vine this is the one true almighty
[52:09] God hear him and live Oh Glory to God
[52:16] Amen so I have no say you have no say he
[52:23] is the one that purchased
[52:25] us no no one else aren't you Hallelujah
[52:29] no one else God didn't take a vote with
[52:33] nobody when he saved
[52:34] you the vote was in himself when he
[52:39] saved you you you can't even vote your
[52:42] way out of the grace of God God is the
[52:45] one that put you there he loved you he
[52:49] bought you and he says I will keep
[52:54] you oh bless the Lord bless the Lord all
[52:59] right any questions so far any questions
[53:01] or comments amen I I love I I I love
[53:05] this part this is really really good
[53:07] stuff man Hallelujah I'm glad to have
[53:10] experienced I I think we can all say
[53:12] that God has taken our wasteing places
[53:16] and he has made something beautiful of
[53:19] us all right second or or Revelations 2
[53:23] and9 he says I Know Thy works and thy
[53:26] tribulation now this conditions of the
[53:28] age and poverty but Thou Art Rich he
[53:33] says uh I know the blasphemy of them
[53:34] which say they are Jews and are not but
[53:37] are the synagogue of Satan the key to
[53:40] this age is most evidently
[53:44] tribulation if there was tribulation in
[53:46] the first age there was now predicted an
[53:49] intensified tribulation throughout the
[53:51] second age there is no doubt but the
[53:55] following words of Paul applied to the
[53:57] mass of
[53:58] Christians uh wherever they were in the
[54:00] world and in every
[54:02] age Hebrews 10 and 32- 38 but call to
[54:06] remembrance the former days in which
[54:08] after ye were illuminated ye endured a
[54:12] great fight of
[54:13] afflictions partly whilst ye were made a
[54:16] gazing stall both by reproaches and
[54:19] afflictions and partly whilst ye became
[54:22] Companions of them that were so used for
[54:26] ye had compassion of me in my bonds and
[54:29] took joyfully the spoiling of your goods
[54:32] knowing in
[54:34] yourselves that ye have in heaven a
[54:37] better and enduring substance
[54:41] amen cast not a away therefore your
[54:45] confidence which has great recompense of
[54:48] reward for you have need of patience
[54:51] that after you have done the will of God
[54:54] you might receive the promise for yet a
[54:57] little while and he that shall come will
[55:00] come and will not tar now the just shall
[55:03] live by faith but if any man draw back
[55:06] my soul shall have no pleasure in him he
[55:10] says the M Association of kind-hearted
[55:12] people with the True Believer might well
[55:16] bring death in return for their kindness
[55:19] now the Lord God allmighty says I know
[55:23] there he is walking in the midst of his
[55:26] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[55:30] the flock but he does but does he hold
[55:34] back the persecution does he stem the
[55:38] tribulation no he does not he simply
[55:42] says I know your
[55:45] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[55:49] your suffering now what a stumbling
[55:52] block this is to so many people like
[55:55] Israel they wonder if God really loves
[55:58] them how can God be just and loving if
[56:02] he stands by and watches his people
[56:05] suffer that is what they asked in
[56:07] Malachi 1
[56:09] 1-3 the burden of the word of the Lord
[56:11] to Israel by Malachi I have loved you
[56:14] saith the Lord but yet ye say wherein
[56:17] hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's
[56:21] brother sayeth the Lord yet I loved
[56:25] Jacob and and I hated Esau and laid his
[56:30] mountains and his Heritage waste for the
[56:33] dragons of the Wilderness you see they
[56:37] could not figure out God's love they
[56:40] thought love meant no suffering they
[56:43] thought love meant a baby with parental
[56:45] care but God said that his love was
[56:49] elective Love Oh Glory to God it's not
[56:54] he's not he's he's not interested in in
[56:57] giving you wealth as much as he's
[57:01] interested in getting you to the other
[57:04] side right he's not interested in
[57:07] babying you here pampering you here as
[57:11] much as he is equipping you to to to
[57:16] overcome the evil one of this age so
[57:20] he's not interested in in in in trying
[57:23] to shelter you on he knows the Eternal
[57:27] seed on the inside of you and he is
[57:31] equipping you to withstand that evil one
[57:34] no matter what the cost because only the
[57:38] Overcomer is going to set in that
[57:40] Throne oh come on now amen so he's
[57:44] Hallelujah God don't I know these days
[57:46] here everyone thinks you know everyone's
[57:48] got to be pampered God does not pamper
[57:50] his people amen you are loved because he
[57:56] has placed his seat on the inside of you
[57:58] and said I'm taking you to a
[58:00] destiny Hallelujah and I'm going to
[58:03] ensure that you make it and it's not
[58:05] going to be by telling you that you're
[58:06] pretty all the time I I I the only way
[58:09] I'm going to do this amen I'm going to
[58:11] throw you in the Lion's de I'm going to
[58:13] throw you in the fiery furnaces I'm
[58:14] going to put you in those situation but
[58:16] I'm telling you everything that you
[58:18] overcome you're going to go to the next
[58:20] and you're going to rise to the next and
[58:21] then and the final will be death
[58:24] itself well Glory glory to God Amen do
[58:28] you love him now he says now but God
[58:32] said his love is elective love the proof
[58:36] of his love is
[58:39] election no matter what happened his
[58:43] love was proven truly by the fact they
[58:47] were chosen un salvation because God had
[58:51] chosen you to Salvation through the
[58:53] sanctification of the spirit and the
[58:54] belief of Truth he may have committed
[58:57] you to death as he did Paul he may have
[58:59] committed you to suffering as he did job
[59:01] that is his prerogative he is Sovereign
[59:05] but it is all with a
[59:08] purpose someone say it's all with a
[59:12] purpose your struggles your trials where
[59:15] you are right now is all with a
[59:19] purpose amen if he did not have a
[59:23] purpose then he would be the author of
[59:25] frustration and not of Peace his purpose
[59:28] is that after we have suffered a while
[59:31] we would be made perfect be established
[59:35] strengthened and settled job said he put
[59:39] strength in US job
[59:42] 236b you see he himself suffered he
[59:46] learned obedience by the things that he
[59:48] suffered he was actually made perfect by
[59:51] the things he suffered Hebrews 5 and
[59:55] 8-9 it says though he were a son yet
[59:59] learned he obedience by the things that
[1:00:01] he suffered being made perfect he became
[1:00:06] the author of Eternal salvation unto all
[1:00:09] them that obey him in plain language the
[1:00:12] very character of Jesus was
[1:00:16] perfected by
[1:00:19] suffering now we we don't we we don't
[1:00:21] ever want to we we don't ever want
[1:00:24] to bypass that if God's put that in our
[1:00:28] lives amen I you know uh uh if he's if
[1:00:32] he's put that in in in our lives then
[1:00:35] then Brothers we we want we want to say
[1:00:37] Lord whatever you are doing I trust you
[1:00:41] you've got to trust him you've got to
[1:00:44] realize he's the one that found you he's
[1:00:48] the one that uh bought you and he's the
[1:00:51] one that says I'll never leave you nor
[1:00:54] forsake you
[1:00:56] amen he's going to bring that out now I
[1:01:01] I I I I had um um I forgot I for some
[1:01:06] reason uh this other quote in the
[1:01:07] Ephesian Church age is not there brother
[1:01:11] uh or I don't I don't have the page
[1:01:12] number so I'm just going to read it to
[1:01:13] you he says now the true brother
[1:01:15] brandom's given the distinction he says
[1:01:17] the True Church of Jesus Christ the Bri
[1:01:19] that the bride is lightened to pure gold
[1:01:22] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:01:24] her attributes are his his glorious
[1:01:26] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:01:30] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[1:01:33] she is to manifest there is no fault in
[1:01:37] her she is all glorious within and
[1:01:39] without from the beginning to the ending
[1:01:43] she is the work of her Lord all of her
[1:01:45] works are perfect in fact in her is
[1:01:48] summed up and manifested the Eternal
[1:01:50] wisdom and purpose of God how can one
[1:01:53] fathom it how can one understand it
[1:01:55] though we cannot do that we can accept
[1:01:59] it by faith for God has spoken
[1:02:05] it hallelujah oh what confidence that
[1:02:08] should give the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:10] but then the very next words but not
[1:02:13] only is the Candlestick of gold it is of
[1:02:16] beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold
[1:02:21] according to her blueprints which were
[1:02:24] spirit-given
[1:02:26] outside of her Lord and Master Jesus
[1:02:28] Christ was ever a people so beaten and
[1:02:30] purged as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:33] surely she is filling up the sufferings
[1:02:36] that Christ has left behind her goods
[1:02:38] are despoiled her life is in Jeopardy
[1:02:40] she has counted as sheep for the
[1:02:42] slaughter she is killed all the day long
[1:02:44] she suffers much but in it all
[1:02:46] retaliates not neither does she cause
[1:02:49] others to suffer worthy of the Gospel is
[1:02:52] this little bride of Christ and as gold
[1:02:55] as malleable whereas brass will break
[1:02:58] with the beating the gold of God will
[1:03:00] bear her suffering for the Lord not
[1:03:03] bowed not broken not destroyed but
[1:03:06] formed as a thing of beauty a joy
[1:03:11] Forever by the trials and testings of
[1:03:15] this
[1:03:16] life Hallelujah trials and testings God
[1:03:20] sends the testings our way can you say
[1:03:23] amen amen there's no other that you're
[1:03:26] going to reflect the image of God is
[1:03:27] through the trials and the testings that
[1:03:30] God sends to you amen he'll send those
[1:03:33] testings to you to see your reaction to
[1:03:36] see how you're going to respond to that
[1:03:39] reaction amen he's wanting to do that he
[1:03:42] does that for you can you say amen amen
[1:03:46] now okay so um all right so we we're at
[1:03:51] the top verse we just finished uh he
[1:03:53] became the author of Eternal salvation
[1:03:55] under the that obey him he says in plain
[1:03:58] language the very character of Jesus was
[1:04:01] perfected by suffering and according to
[1:04:04] Paul he has left his church a measuring
[1:04:06] of suffering that they too by their
[1:04:09] faith in God while suffering for him
[1:04:12] would come to a place of perfection why
[1:04:14] did he want this James 1 2 1 and 2-4 my
[1:04:20] brethren count it all joy when ye fall
[1:04:23] into diverse into diverse Temptations
[1:04:26] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:04:28] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:04:32] have a perfect work that you may be
[1:04:35] perfect and entire wanting nothing why
[1:04:39] does he stand by the reason is in Romans
[1:04:43] 8:17 uh through through 18 if children
[1:04:47] then HS and HS of God and join HS with
[1:04:51] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:04:54] that we may may be also glorified
[1:04:58] together for I reckon that the
[1:04:59] sufferings of this time are not worthy
[1:05:01] to be compared with the glory which
[1:05:02] shall be revealed in US unless we suffer
[1:05:06] with him we cannot reign with him you
[1:05:10] have to suffer to Reign the reason for
[1:05:12] this is that character simply is never
[1:05:15] made without suffering character is a
[1:05:19] victory not a gift everyone say it with
[1:05:21] me character is a victory and not a gift
[1:05:27] a man without character can't Reign
[1:05:29] because power apart from character is
[1:05:31] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:05:35] to rule and since he wants us to share
[1:05:38] even his throne on the same basis that
[1:05:40] he overcame and to sit down in his
[1:05:42] father's Throne then we have to overcome
[1:05:45] to sit with him and the little temporary
[1:05:48] sufferings we go through now is not
[1:05:50] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:05:52] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:05:55] he he comes oh what Treasures are laid
[1:05:58] up for those who are willing to enter
[1:06:00] into his kingdom through much
[1:06:03] tribulation can you say Amen so so the
[1:06:06] trials and the tribulations listen
[1:06:09] listen take those things amen instead of
[1:06:12] getting your nose out of joint instead
[1:06:14] of getting all upset when situations
[1:06:16] aren't going your way remember God is is
[1:06:21] is sends everything your way to bring
[1:06:25] you into that maturity that he is
[1:06:29] looking
[1:06:30] for he's looking for this the the
[1:06:34] authority of adoption is given to a
[1:06:38] people who has surrendered themselves to
[1:06:41] the authority of God's
[1:06:44] word hallelujah can you say amen amen
[1:06:48] that's that's that that's that's right
[1:06:51] you know let's just turn real quickly uh
[1:06:53] hold your place there and let's go over
[1:06:54] to the page 355 real quickly amen uh
[1:06:59] let's I I was reading this and I thought
[1:07:02] this was beautiful 355 and
[1:07:05] one and and and he's he's sharing what
[1:07:08] he's wanting you're his you're his own
[1:07:11] and he's treating you like his sons
[1:07:14] praise the Lord amen now watch this uh
[1:07:17] when you're there say amen amen all
[1:07:20] right herein is now set forth the love
[1:07:22] of God he desired in love a family of
[1:07:25] his own a family of Sons Sons like
[1:07:33] himself therefore before him lies all
[1:07:36] mankind as one lump of clay out of that
[1:07:39] same lump he will now make vessels unto
[1:07:42] honor and dishonor the choosing will be
[1:07:46] his own then those choosen chosen ones
[1:07:50] born of his spirit will be trained
[1:07:53] somebody say train me will be trained to
[1:07:56] conform to His Image in their walk he
[1:08:00] reproves with all longsuffering and
[1:08:03] gentleness and mercy he chastens with
[1:08:06] nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter
[1:08:10] must take the vessel that he is working
[1:08:12] on and thoroughly break it down in order
[1:08:15] that he may rebuild it exactly as he
[1:08:18] desires it but here we go again but it
[1:08:21] is
[1:08:23] love that is his love another way of his
[1:08:29] love there is not and there cannot be oh
[1:08:35] aren't you glad for God's
[1:08:37] love you see people want it you know we
[1:08:39] and sometimes we're all of us poor folks
[1:08:41] we we we think man you know we just
[1:08:44] ain't we just ain't got the brains to uh
[1:08:46] you know to to succeed or we haven't got
[1:08:49] this that and the other the Lord is the
[1:08:51] one that's planned out our lives he's
[1:08:53] he's planned out our lives
[1:08:55] amen and just and just to let you know I
[1:08:58] mean Successful guys I believe there's
[1:09:00] there's plenty of successful amen um but
[1:09:03] but brother Bram says there's going to
[1:09:04] be very few successful and Rich folks
[1:09:06] that make it into the kingdom of God why
[1:09:09] because they've done it all themselves
[1:09:11] they're they're wealthy men they've
[1:09:13] built their lives they've done their
[1:09:14] things like that God that there's
[1:09:16] nothing wrong uh with having
[1:09:19] success but having a humble heart having
[1:09:22] a Divine heart of humility is what God's
[1:09:25] looking for can you say amen amen that's
[1:09:28] what he wants now okay so let's go
[1:09:31] back let's see um okay we're down to the
[1:09:35] uh second paragraph in page 117 think it
[1:09:39] not strange the fiery trials that are to
[1:09:42] try you that is what Peter said it is
[1:09:45] strange that God wants to develop a
[1:09:48] Christlike character or is it strange
[1:09:51] that God wants to develop a Christlike
[1:09:53] character that comes through suffering
[1:09:56] no sir we all have trials we are all
[1:09:59] tried and chastened as Sons not as one
[1:10:03] and not one but goes through that the
[1:10:06] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:10:08] being tried hasn't got it it isn't of
[1:10:12] God Hebrews 12 and 6 verses 6 and verse
[1:10:16] 8 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:10:20] and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:10:22] receiveth but if you be without
[1:10:24] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:10:27] then are ye bastards and not Sons if you
[1:10:31] can't take
[1:10:32] correction amen it shows that that
[1:10:35] window Martin is still living if I can't
[1:10:38] take his correction can you say amen he
[1:10:41] says now this special condition in
[1:10:44] Smyrna must be applied to every age
[1:10:49] there is no uh age free from it there is
[1:10:53] no True Believer free from it
[1:10:55] this is of god this is the will of God
[1:11:00] it is needful let's let's just read
[1:11:02] those three lines together this is of
[1:11:05] god this is the will of God it is
[1:11:10] needful we need the Lord to teach us the
[1:11:13] truth that we are to suffer and be
[1:11:16] Christlike in doing it love suffereth
[1:11:19] long and His Kind Matthew 5:1 through2
[1:11:24] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:11:26] and persecute you and shall say all
[1:11:29] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:11:31] my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad
[1:11:35] for great is your reward in heaven for
[1:11:38] so persecuted they the prophets which
[1:11:40] were before you the cloudy skies and
[1:11:44] storms of life are no signs of God's
[1:11:49] disapproval why don't you just tell the
[1:11:51] devil are you are you listening
[1:11:53] devil amen and cloudy skies and storms
[1:11:58] of life are no signs of God's
[1:12:02] disapproval I'm going through this oh
[1:12:05] God must be against me God must not love
[1:12:07] me it might mean that God really thinks
[1:12:09] a lot of
[1:12:10] you come on it was God bragging on job
[1:12:14] it was God saying hey have you tried my
[1:12:17] servant job there ain't no one
[1:12:20] liking right amen so he says neither are
[1:12:24] bright SK and still water signs of his
[1:12:27] love and approval his approval of any of
[1:12:31] us is only in the Beloved his love is
[1:12:36] elective which he had for us before the
[1:12:39] foundation of the world does he love us
[1:12:42] ah yes but how shall we know shall we
[1:12:45] know because or we shall know because he
[1:12:48] said so manifested that he did love us
[1:12:52] for he uh for he brought brought us to
[1:12:55] himself and gave us of his Spirit
[1:12:58] placing us as sons and how shall I prove
[1:13:01] my love to him by believing what he said
[1:13:05] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:13:08] the trials uh that he and his wisdom
[1:13:11] allows to come to pass well can you say
[1:13:14] amen amen now now now what is now what
[1:13:17] is he saying amen he said now how what
[1:13:20] am I to do what what am I going to do he
[1:13:22] said how can I prove my love back to him
[1:13:24] by believing what he says and conducting
[1:13:27] myself with joy in the amidst the trials
[1:13:31] that he in his wisdom has placed in my
[1:13:37] life you know what that means your
[1:13:40] attitude concerning your situations that
[1:13:43] you go through on a daily basis
[1:13:46] matters the way you react the way that
[1:13:50] you respond the way that you do these
[1:13:53] things the these it matters it's the
[1:13:56] spirit of the Lord that is bringing us
[1:14:00] in these areas because he is molding us
[1:14:03] and making us well praise the Lord we're
[1:14:07] not we're not going to get to it tonight
[1:14:08] so I'm I'm want to there was one over
[1:14:10] it'll be on next Wednesday nights but uh
[1:14:14] 123 if if if you were to look there at
[1:14:16] 123 and the the second uh paragraph he
[1:14:21] says now you see the one difference
[1:14:24] between Israel and the the rest of the
[1:14:25] Nations was
[1:14:27] God put God to one side and Israel was
[1:14:31] like any other
[1:14:35] Nation our
[1:14:38] attitudes toward God and what he is
[1:14:41] trying to work in our lives and we we we
[1:14:44] allow ourselves amen we we're fighting
[1:14:47] for our rights or we're doing this we
[1:14:50] let that wolf nature come up within us
[1:14:53] we we you're missing in the point of
[1:14:56] Christianity you're missing the point of
[1:14:59] what God is trying to mold in US sheep
[1:15:03] are not they're they're they they they
[1:15:07] they are um uh a
[1:15:10] powerless they have no ability of their
[1:15:12] own sheep bear the wool and then
[1:15:15] somebody else takes
[1:15:18] it
[1:15:19] right and and and and and they provide
[1:15:22] clothing and they do all of this sheep
[1:15:24] and the and and and the wol provides so
[1:15:27] much sheep has nothing that can say
[1:15:29] about it sheep has nothing that can say
[1:15:32] about it Jesus opened not his mouth to
[1:15:36] say a
[1:15:38] thing because he was God's
[1:15:43] lamb and so God and we all know how he
[1:15:47] won Hallelujah he won as a lamb not a
[1:15:52] lion he did not defeat his rights he
[1:15:56] laid his rights down and the power of
[1:16:00] Resurrection Came Upon him well glory be
[1:16:03] to God how am I going to win in my home
[1:16:06] how am I going to win on my job how am I
[1:16:08] going to win God you've allow these
[1:16:11] situations to
[1:16:13] come help me to handle them the way that
[1:16:18] you want me to handle them the spirit of
[1:16:22] the Lord makes the difference
[1:16:25] and so our attitudes toward God that our
[1:16:29] attitudes remember we're nothing without
[1:16:32] him and we're saying Lord if we're if if
[1:16:34] we're true with our confession mold me
[1:16:37] make me break me mold me the song uh
[1:16:41] break me mold me make
[1:16:45] me however that one goes amen can you
[1:16:48] say Amen so so we don't want we don't
[1:16:51] want a wrong Spirit never
[1:16:55] and when we do don't defend it repent
[1:16:59] repent right now I know we're all human
[1:17:02] but the thing is is we're learning God's
[1:17:04] right we're wrong and we say
[1:17:09] sorry it's hard for us men to do but

[1:21:00] the Lord it isn't that just beautiful
[1:21:03] amen okay
[1:21:05] so so I you know once again once again
[1:21:10] that that Faith you know brother brother
[1:21:12] brandham I've got it here somewhere um
[1:21:16] uh brother brandham is this not in the
[1:21:18] church age book in time evangelism he
[1:21:20] said now Peter had a sword he pulled
[1:21:23] that sword and was going to cut the high
[1:21:24] priest uh uh ears off and and and things
[1:21:29] like that he did it but when it came to
[1:21:31] a real Christian Courage he didn't have
[1:21:34] it he backed up and denied it so he's
[1:21:37] got his sword ready to cut the high
[1:21:40] priest ER all for coming after Jesus but
[1:21:43] then he says but then when it came time
[1:21:45] for him to stand on him when it
[1:21:47] counted he didn't have the Christian
[1:21:50] Courage his sword wasn't going to take
[1:21:52] care of everybody he he just he's he
[1:21:56] started cussing and saying I don't know
[1:21:57] him I've never met him I don't know who
[1:21:59] he is Jesus is over looking at him
[1:22:01] saying thanks
[1:22:04] buddy can you say Amen now watch he says
[1:22:07] he could cut the high priest ear off
[1:22:10] with the sword sure he know how to
[1:22:12] handle it amen that's but when it come
[1:22:16] to the squeeze and time to stand on the
[1:22:19] word of God he didn't have the courage
[1:22:22] he even denied the that he know Jesus
[1:22:25] there's where it's at today we got
[1:22:27] courage to build big buildings put
[1:22:29] millions of dollars in them we've got
[1:22:31] courage to put pipe organs and plush
[1:22:34] seats and everything and go out and prop
[1:22:35] the light and from place to place and
[1:22:37] make Methodist to become Baptist and so
[1:22:39] forth back and forth like that but when
[1:22:41] it comes to the Christian Courage to
[1:22:43] accept the word and the message of God
[1:22:46] and stand there on it we are few so what
[1:22:49] goods your stones without a stone Mason
[1:22:53] is that right go God's looking for
[1:22:55] character not membership character
[1:22:59] eleazer when he went to get the body of
[1:23:02] the Bride for Isaac he sweated it out
[1:23:06] until he found
[1:23:09] character can I hear a great big
[1:23:12] amen now amen okay so now are we let's
[1:23:16] say we're on page
[1:23:19] 118 um okay we're at we're at paragraph
[1:23:23] two
[1:23:26] it says I Know Thy
[1:23:28] poverty but Thou Art Rich there it is
[1:23:31] again see him walking up and down in the
[1:23:35] midst of his church like a father he is
[1:23:38] looking down upon his family he is the
[1:23:40] head of his household he is the provider
[1:23:43] he is the protector yet he looks on at
[1:23:47] their
[1:23:48] poverty oh how the untutored believer
[1:23:51] stumbles at this how can God bear to
[1:23:54] look upon his own in the time of need
[1:23:56] and just and not just stop at it all
[1:24:00] just give in and lavish everything
[1:24:02] material upon them here is where you
[1:24:04] have to believe again in the love and
[1:24:08] goodness and wisdom of God this too is
[1:24:12] needful remember he admonished take no
[1:24:15] thought for tomorrow for tomorrow what
[1:24:18] you shall eat or what you shall put on
[1:24:21] your father knoweth the things that ye
[1:24:24] have need of he who clothes the Lily and
[1:24:27] Feats the sparrow shall do much more for
[1:24:30] you these physical things are not the
[1:24:33] true basic necessities of your life for
[1:24:36] a man's life consists not of the things
[1:24:38] he possesses but seek but rather seek ye
[1:24:43] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:24:45] righteousness and all material
[1:24:47] Necessities will be added unto you the
[1:24:50] people of God are not Material minded
[1:24:53] they are christm minded they do not seek
[1:24:57] Treasures that are below they seek those
[1:25:01] above it is absolutely true the majority
[1:25:04] of Christians are not wealthy rather
[1:25:06] they are on the Poor Side it was so in
[1:25:09] Jesus say It was so in Paul's day and it
[1:25:12] should be true today oh it is not true
[1:25:14] today for the Le oysan age is one of
[1:25:17] vast wealth where often the Criterion of
[1:25:20] spirituality is an abundance of Earthly
[1:25:23] Goods my
[1:25:25] how rich the church is in Goods but how
[1:25:28] poor in spirit blessed be ye poor for
[1:25:32] yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom
[1:25:35] of God is Not meat and drink it is not
[1:25:38] Material it is within us a rich man is
[1:25:43] rich in God not in worldly things oh
[1:25:48] cries the spirit I see your poverty I
[1:25:52] see your need you haven't very much if
[1:25:55] anything to boast of but what you did
[1:25:59] have and and what you did have is taken
[1:26:01] from you you gladly gave up your
[1:26:04] possessions in exchange for Eternal ones
[1:26:06] Hallelujah you are laughed at you are
[1:26:08] scorned you don't have material
[1:26:10] resources to fall back on but you are
[1:26:13] rich in spite of it all your security
[1:26:15] lies in him who is your shield and
[1:26:18] exceeding great joy your kingdom is yet
[1:26:22] to come but it will come someone shout
[1:26:25] hallelujah hallu and it will be an
[1:26:29] everlasting one yes I'm mindful of your
[1:26:32] trials and woes I know how hard it is to
[1:26:36] get
[1:26:37] along but I will remember all this when
[1:26:40] I return to claim you as my own and then
[1:26:44] I will reward you somebody say
[1:26:47] then I will I will reward
[1:26:51] you this is nothing against rich people
[1:26:54] because God can save a rich man some of
[1:26:56] God's children are rich but money can be
[1:26:59] such a snare not only to those who have
[1:27:01] it but to those who don't have it way
[1:27:04] back in there in the first age James
[1:27:07] cried out to those who were putting
[1:27:09] stock in wealthy people have not the
[1:27:11] Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:27:13] respects respective persons the poor
[1:27:16] there were trying to butter up the rich
[1:27:17] in order to get help rather than
[1:27:19] trusting in God don't do it says James
[1:27:22] don't do it money isn't everything money
[1:27:28] isn't the answer today it is not the
[1:27:31] answer either we have more wealth than
[1:27:34] we have ever had and yet less is being
[1:27:37] accomplished spiritually it is not with
[1:27:39] money that God works he moves by his
[1:27:43] spirit and that moving of the spirit
[1:27:46] comes only to a consec life consecrated
[1:27:51] to the word
[1:27:54] amen
[1:27:56] consecrated to the word now how many
[1:27:59] wants your life to be
[1:28:05] consecrated the offenses are going to
[1:28:07] come the trials are going to come but
[1:28:10] for the ele and sometimes it can even it
[1:28:12] can even uh uh move in the church like
[1:28:14] shelving falling over yesterday I I
[1:28:17] still haven't I still haven't seen it
[1:28:19] but I but I heard that I seen pictures
[1:28:22] and uh oh wow uh
[1:28:26] but God allowed it now I'm not making an
[1:28:29] excuse I'm still going to look at my
[1:28:31] shelving and make sure that that it
[1:28:33] doesn't happen again but but at the same
[1:28:37] time Trials come and sometimes it's not
[1:28:40] just in in in a family sometimes it's in
[1:28:42] the church sometimes it's between
[1:28:45] children and mamas and daddies sometimes
[1:28:47] it's sometimes it's between
[1:28:50] preachers so trials these these things
[1:28:53] come
[1:28:54] but we see but the but the thing is even
[1:28:57] in our miscommunications and our
[1:28:58] misunderstandings and our and our and
[1:29:00] our and our and our whatever I don't I
[1:29:01] don't think anyone's blaming anybody but
[1:29:04] um
[1:29:07] um but even even even in those kind of
[1:29:10] situations like yesterday see we're
[1:29:12] still on the same team whereas the evil
[1:29:15] one is not on our team and Satan is
[1:29:18] doing everything he can to try to do it
[1:29:21] and there's where we have to be wise
[1:29:23] because we have character we have
[1:29:26] character to say whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:29:28] whoa whoa this is a trick of the devil
[1:29:31] right and so what did we do we just all
[1:29:33] said oops okay yep we'll look at that
[1:29:35] yep yep we'll do what we have to do yep
[1:29:36] see and then something that could have
[1:29:38] been a well you should and you shouldn't
[1:29:40] and this that and the other and and and
[1:29:42] uh we can't trust brother wend to be
[1:29:44] Pastor anymore he don't even know how to
[1:29:45] build shelves all you know all that kind
[1:29:48] of stuff that would that that would you
[1:29:50] know that that we would all bring
[1:29:51] together but yet we can understand hey
[1:29:54] hey this was a trick of the devil God's
[1:29:59] been trying to send a a a Revival and I
[1:30:01] you know there was there's no doubt in
[1:30:03] my mind that the devil would have loved
[1:30:05] to have um had a kid underneath that
[1:30:06] thing you know and um so you know so we
[1:30:10] you know we I I believe I I I believe uh
[1:30:14] Jesus is the one that says said that
[1:30:16] there in Matthew he he says you offenses
[1:30:19] are going to come Jesus said offenses
[1:30:22] are going to come they're going to come
[1:30:24] at you but he says but woe to the one
[1:30:29] who brings the offense so offences are
[1:30:32] going to be around us but what we've got
[1:30:35] to do is again going back to maturity
[1:30:39] going back to maturity saying hey the
[1:30:41] Lord has taught me that trials are
[1:30:44] coming and instead of getting all worked
[1:30:46] up no no Satan is trying to do something
[1:30:51] here God's allowed it to come yeah so
[1:30:54] what I'm going to do is I'm I'm going
[1:30:57] I'm going to be the master of this
[1:30:59] situation and that's not by the way of a
[1:31:01] wolf it's by the way of a
[1:31:04] lamb that's the way we win in Christ
[1:31:07] well can you say amen amen and what what
[1:31:10] are we doing then we give no place for
[1:31:14] the devil in our lives in our homes even
[1:31:17] on our jobs I'm talking about I'm
[1:31:19] talking about even even between you and
[1:31:21] The Sinner and the sinner's coming out
[1:31:23] there and the devil is anointing that
[1:31:24] sinner to try to get at your at your
[1:31:27] walk with God there is character that
[1:31:30] has being molded in you through your
[1:31:32] sufferings that you've been going
[1:31:34] through even in your at in your home
[1:31:38] you're gaining character we're we're
[1:31:40] gaining character with one another and
[1:31:42] when we go outside there we know how to
[1:31:44] possess our temples even when we go
[1:31:47] outside there and we're saying all right
[1:31:49] amen all right so what are we doing do
[1:31:52] we do we fail oh yeah many of times amen
[1:31:56] we we we'll we'll fall short
[1:32:00] repent the blood wasn't given for The
[1:32:03] Sinner the blood was given for
[1:32:06] Christians we just repent and say sorry
[1:32:11] and and we and and we do it with a
[1:32:13] genuine
[1:32:14] heart man those guys that have a hard
[1:32:17] time repenting you know I I've got a you
[1:32:20] know I've got a problem with that just

[1:32:25] you you can't do that then you need to
[1:32:27] you if you don't have that in your heart
[1:32:29] to do that then you need to find
[1:32:31] yourself an altar somewhere because that
[1:32:34] that's the Zeal of the age but the bom
[1:32:37] said the Zeal of this Leo toy and age is
[1:32:43] repentance repentance and that's not
[1:32:46] once you know 30 years ago that means
[1:32:48] you're backsliding on a daily basis
[1:32:51] you're in this mortal flesh and if you f
[1:32:53] all and come short of the glory of God
[1:32:56] run to the fountain filled with blood

[1:35:27] goes the credit goes to you Sister
[1:35:32] Carol she's witnessed and witnessed and

[1:35:40] huh
[1:35:43] amen that's that's just awesome Amen so
[1:35:46] thankful to the Lord for that and
[1:35:51] Angie that's really been bothering me
[1:35:54] and I want to
[1:35:55] know
[1:35:58] um if a woman in the
[1:36:01] church can she say amen and stuff like
[1:36:04] that when the preacher is preaching I
[1:36:05] mean what how much can she
[1:36:08] do a woman is just as free in in the
[1:36:12] church to participate in in in every
[1:36:15] form of worship other than to
[1:36:18] preach she can
[1:36:21] prophesy she can you know she she can uh
[1:36:24] she can sing she can amen she can give a
[1:36:28] testimony but she but she cannot
[1:36:31] take uh she cannot usurp
[1:36:35] Authority and uh and teach over so uh
[1:36:40] but but brother brand said that she can
[1:36:42] she can be a part of of of U all all all
[1:36:48] of the
[1:36:49] worship and so uh and I believe uh
[1:37:01] yeah you know I probably so I you know I
[1:37:07] I I I don't I don't I wouldn't think
[1:37:10] that that would necessarily be sin if if
[1:37:13] there was if we were in a position to
[1:37:15] where we need you know we needed
[1:37:17] somebody but but right I I I'm I I I
[1:37:21] lean real real strongly that way uh um
[1:37:27] you just can't find that in scripture
[1:37:29] cannot teach or usurp authority over man
[1:37:32] and that's talking about handling the
[1:37:33] word of the Lord and so um but she can
[1:37:37] sing you know they can do that uh I see
[1:37:41] nothing wrong with Amy uh leading s or
[1:37:44] uh having the pre-service songs and
[1:37:47] things the way that we do um you know
[1:37:51] those those kinds of things like that
[1:37:53] that all you know each each church is
[1:37:55] Sovereign in that regard but as far as
[1:37:58] as leadership teaching the word or
[1:38:02] anything like that a woman has no place
[1:38:05] in the five-fold
[1:38:08] ministry so does that answer your
[1:38:12] question yeah anyone
[1:38:19] else about you know character being a
[1:38:22] victory and power with characters fit
[1:38:24] the
[1:38:26] rule and with a with that land likee
[1:38:29] nature yeah thought that was
[1:38:32] outstanding uh and it just came to my
[1:38:35] mind uh you know I don't know if it's on
[1:38:39] tape where brother Brandon was
[1:38:41] preaching and uh that couple was making
[1:38:45] out
[1:38:47] yeah and I believe if I got it correct
[1:38:51] uh he was uh uh was
[1:38:55] told uh if you say the word they they'll
[1:38:58] pack them out
[1:39:01] yeah but he he
[1:39:04] said when the pillar of fire was right
[1:39:07] there and yeah and he said I forgive you
[1:39:13] yeah that's powerful
[1:39:16] amen yeah that's that's powerful they're
[1:39:20] in your hands they're in your hands do
[1:39:22] do with them as you will
[1:39:25] yeah yeah and
[1:39:29] and that that's a that's the character
[1:39:32] because because he kept on the the you
[1:39:36] know she was she wasn't dressed right in
[1:39:38] the first place and then you know and so
[1:39:42] they they had tried to get her to dress
[1:39:43] and then you know and then she and they
[1:39:45] were right up front and he just kept you
[1:39:47] know kissing on her and making love and
[1:39:50] almost in her lap and and brother
[1:39:53] Brandon was say hey this is this is
[1:39:55] religious service don't do that
[1:39:58] here and and going on and then he said I
[1:40:00] said
[1:40:02] stop and and going on and then he then
[1:40:05] he says and then it just like
[1:40:08] death presence of the Lord he says and
[1:40:10] the whole audience felt
[1:40:12] it and he says the angel of the Lord
[1:40:14] says they're in your hands do with them
[1:40:18] as you
[1:40:19] wish
[1:40:22] wow wow wasn't
[1:40:25] he he was a weak I I I believe I'd have
[1:40:29] to go back and refresh myself but he he
[1:40:31] was warned ahead of time uh by by the
[1:40:35] angel of the Lord saying um there it's
[1:40:38] there's a trap set that there's there's
[1:40:39] a trap it said handle be wise and um and
[1:40:45] that and that's the deal how many how
[1:40:47] many traps go go before us and we just
[1:40:50] walk right into them because we're not
[1:40:52] we're not walking in the maturity of the
[1:40:55] word like we
[1:40:56] should and um uh but but he did and so
[1:41:02] he said he said those he said that
[1:41:03] couple they knew it they just they were
[1:41:08] just they were scared to death and
