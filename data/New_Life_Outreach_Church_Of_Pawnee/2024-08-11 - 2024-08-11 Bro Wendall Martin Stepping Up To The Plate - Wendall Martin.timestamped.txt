[36:17] savior amen and I I I just know amen
[36:23] Victory Is Ours and Denise is a child of
[36:26] God we just we're not put putting up
[36:27] with that nonsense we're going to keep r
[36:30] on and believe in the Lord amen I'd like
[36:34] to read here in the The Book of Romans
[36:36] the 8th
[36:38] chapter
[36:39] amen and
[36:42] um we um as we
[36:47] ministered uh this morning on the could
[36:49] the real
[36:50] you step forward I'm I want to continue
[36:54] my thoughts but tonight we're going to
[36:57] we're going on a title of stepping up to
[36:59] the
[37:00] plate amen so I picked something from I
[37:04] didn't even know it was a movie The or a
[37:06] TV show until I looked at it yesterday I
[37:08] wondered well where is that could the
[37:10] real man stand step uh come forward and
[37:13] the the real you and U it's used a lot
[37:17] but it was coined there in in the
[37:19] 50s and um and so tonight I I think U am
[37:25] man we need to step up to the place L as
[37:28] Believers can you say Amen Romans 8 and
[37:32] the first
[37:33] verse therefore or there is therefore
[37:36] now no condemnation to them which are in
[37:39] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[37:43] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[37:47] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[37:53] hath made me free from the law of sin
[37:56] and death
[37:58] for what the law could not do in that it
[38:01] was weak through the
[38:03] flesh God sending his own son in the
[38:06] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[38:10] condemn sin in the flesh that the
[38:13] righteousness of the law might be
[38:16] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[38:20] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[38:24] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[38:26] of the flesh but they that are after
[38:27] after the spirit the things of the
[38:30] spirit may the Lord add His blessings to
[38:33] his word you can have your seats here
[38:36] tonight
[38:38] amen so we we look here as we continue
[38:44] on with our with our thoughts this
[38:48] evening the real you amen is not this
[38:53] flesh you will never be able to amen uh
[38:57] to to to do it but to understand that
[39:01] amen this life within you is is an
[39:05] incredible thing it did not just start
[39:08] um at your birth but you were a son from
[39:13] all times you're not a son today amen
[39:17] you didn't just have a beginning here
[39:19] the life of God is within you brother
[39:22] bradam would say death nor nothing else
[39:25] can ever separate them because they are
[39:28] from eternity they stepped out uh uh
[39:32] into the space of time and will return
[39:34] back to Eternity eternity dropped down
[39:38] in a body called time and then it goes
[39:41] right back into eternity again it cannot
[39:45] perish amen so he's talking about you
[39:49] you came from eternity you're living in
[39:52] a body in that that is a house amen and
[39:56] this this you you had fallen your soul
[39:59] had fallen that is true amen just
[40:02] everything had fallen and uh everything
[40:05] about Humanity there is nothing about
[40:07] Humanity that that is any good amen
[40:10] everything about you is is is worthless
[40:13] but everything about God is eternal
[40:17] everything about this flesh there is
[40:19] there is no good found in any of you
[40:21] amen but everything about God matters of
[40:24] fact the the the uh Apostle Paul there
[40:26] in Romans 7 7 24 says oh Wretched Man
[40:30] that I am who shall deliver me from the
[40:33] body of this death and and I I I was I
[40:37] was thinking about this Humanity how
[40:39] that we man we have we you you there's
[40:43] no pulling you there's no picking you up
[40:46] you cannot pick yourselves up by your
[40:48] own bootstraps there's there's no way to
[40:51] to to to overcome the spirit of
[40:54] Oppression and depression there's no way
[40:56] amen in in in these cases like like
[40:59] Denise and that that blood pressure when
[41:01] the doctors have tried everything and
[41:03] they can't they can't do it matters of
[41:04] fact I you know I I think those doctors
[41:07] uh uh a lot you know that's why they
[41:10] practice medicine just trying to figure
[41:12] out what's going on you know amen and it
[41:15] and it seems that everything about us is
[41:18] is is falling and and our soul was in
[41:22] that condition uh uh uh when you're when
[41:25] the soul was out of it place when it was
[41:28] out of its position all of nature just
[41:32] just is is Satan just plays havoc with
[41:35] everybody amen all nature and and it
[41:39] reminded me of of a of of of a story
[41:43] that brother brandham was talking about
[41:45] Billy Paul and how that Billy Paul
[41:47] instead of me telling it it's going to
[41:49] be a little bit lengthy but I'm going to
[41:50] read the story to you amen he says two
[41:53] uh two years three years ago Billy Paul
[41:56] got into a habit
[41:58] and got running around there and and
[42:00] that's the reason I had to send him to
[42:01] waah hatchee to the school our public
[42:04] school with a bunch of those the little
[42:06] boys and things all smoking cigarettes
[42:07] and things and and Billy come come up
[42:10] home one day and how you getting along
[42:12] Daddy and I seen a vision pop over him
[42:14] and I said come here a minute I want to
[42:16] talk to you and he said what is it Daddy
[42:18] I said what are you doing smoking
[42:19] cigarettes and he says I'm not and I
[42:22] said don't you lie to me Billy he
[42:24] commenced to crying and and he well he
[42:27] said I I I I won't do it no more Daddy
[42:30] and and he went on out and he and he
[42:32] kept on doing it and he wasn't hiding it
[42:34] he can't hide it um no no so I seen a
[42:38] vision and the Lord showed me that
[42:40] billing it Billy had disobeyed me and it
[42:42] jumped through a window and was going
[42:44] laughing Head Over Heels like that down
[42:47] on through eternity turning over and
[42:49] over when I come out of the vision I was
[42:51] screaming to the top of my voice oh God
[42:53] don't take my boy only boy I have don't
[42:56] take him Lord and I was screaming to the
[42:59] top of my voice I told Billy and so
[43:02] Billy that day he went fishing and been
[43:05] hanging down on the on the river a lot
[43:07] and there was a a a a man from India
[43:10] there to see me and some more ministers
[43:12] and and went down into New Albany and
[43:15] and uh with my w with with my wife and
[43:18] she had to uh go down there to get get
[43:21] something another so uh we we went down
[43:24] and and I I was sitting talking to the
[43:26] min SS and and all at once something
[43:29] said get out of here real quick and I I
[43:32] thought it was just my imagination and I
[43:34] said well now Brethren we're going to go
[43:36] to India as soon as as as we can
[43:38] possibly can and something says get out
[43:41] of here get to yourself I got out of the
[43:43] car and I said excuse me Brethren just a
[43:46] minute I I went around the corner and
[43:48] and I I went around and I looked no one
[43:50] was looking and I said father what is it
[43:53] he said go to Billy Paul at once and I I
[43:56] run back real quick and M was coming up
[43:59] the street and my wife and I I said
[44:01] hurry honey hurry something's wrong with
[44:03] Billy and we run and jumped in the car
[44:06] and took out to Jeffersonville about
[44:08] five or six
[44:09] miles and I went into the yard my
[44:11] mother-in-law standing in the yard and
[44:13] screaming to the top of her voice and
[44:15] she said Billy's dying come come you uh
[44:19] got him at the hospital and I said what
[44:21] happened and she said well he come down
[44:24] here and he had a sore throat and he was
[44:25] afraid uh you was going to catch him
[44:28] with a sore throat and tell him he was
[44:29] smoking cigarettes and and he went down
[44:32] and your good friend the doc the best
[44:34] doctor there is in in the nation one of
[44:36] the best Sadir gave him a a shot of
[44:39] penicillin and swelled up about that big
[44:43] in just about 3 minutes and he come up
[44:45] there and wrapped him in blankets and
[44:47] rushed him to the
[44:49] hospital and I I ran out real quick and
[44:52] and here come the doctor like that and
[44:54] took off his hat and Billy I've killed
[44:55] your boy I said oh doc surely not and I
[44:59] run into the room and they had oxygen
[45:01] over him and everything and pumping and
[45:03] giving adrenaline into his over his
[45:05] heart and and he just his his heart
[45:08] going on down and down and I said could
[45:12] could I be with him a minute and so he
[45:14] he walked he just walked out of the room
[45:16] and I knelt down put my hands upon him
[45:18] and I said dear God please hasn't my
[45:21] heart been broken enough in these days
[45:24] in my days please Jesus oh oh God give
[45:27] my boy another chance Lord please I ask
[45:31] that you that you with all my heart as
[45:34] your servant if you'll spare the life of
[45:36] my boy he's he's so good to me and helps
[45:39] in the meetings and he's loyal to me I
[45:41] need him God please don't take him I ask
[45:44] you not and I looked and I saw a vision
[45:48] of him falling like that turning over
[45:50] and over like like it was a couple
[45:53] nights before and when I've seen the
[45:55] vision and I I seen two big arms come
[45:58] out and catch him like this and start
[46:01] bearing him right back up going right
[46:03] back up like that and I raised up and
[46:06] Billy turned around just as black as he
[46:08] could be and his lips swell way out and
[46:11] his eyes are turned real red and turned
[46:14] black or turned back and I he said daddy
[46:17] where are you daddy where are you Daddy
[46:20] and I said I'm standing right here honey
[46:22] it's all over now
[46:25] amen I thought of this is is I as we
[46:29] seen the the prophet's son and how that
[46:32] amen falling and falling and falling I
[46:36] think that is Humanity falling and
[46:38] falling sons of God falling and falling
[46:42] you through eternity and there was no
[46:44] hope for the sons of God now Billy Billy
[46:47] was a Son of God he was a son of brother
[46:49] brandham but he was also a Son of God
[46:52] and and amen and as Billy was in his sin
[46:56] and having a hard time overcoming amen
[46:59] those things but yet as as the prophet
[47:03] of God seen him falling and Fallen but
[47:06] then there was two arms that reached out
[47:09] and caught him and bore him back up and
[47:13] I I think of of Fallen Humanity the
[47:16] Fallen Sons every one of you were Fallen
[47:19] amen every one of you living and you're
[47:21] still living in a fallen body and your
[47:24] soul amen would have went straight to
[47:27] hell if it had not been for the grace of
[47:30] God but it was the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:33] amen that caught your fallen so as the
[47:36] song says amazing grace shall always be
[47:40] my song of Praise amen and it it it was
[47:44] that amazing grace that caught my
[47:47] falling soul and brought me back to him
[47:51] now I I want to say it is nothing but
[47:53] Grace it is you'll never be good enough
[47:55] for your salvation you'll never be good
[47:58] enough for heaven you'll never ever be
[48:00] good enough amen for any anything it was
[48:03] God's good pleasure at the beginning
[48:06] amen that called you and ordained
[48:09] you amen God sent Jesus amen to redeem
[48:14] you back you were always a son someone
[48:18] say I was always a son and God was going
[48:22] to do what it was what what he had to do
[48:25] to redeem you and to bring you back to
[48:28] him amen aren't you glad for those two
[48:31] big arms that God Amen brought you to
[48:33] himself hallelujah amen but God couldn't
[48:36] condemn the soul with that house that
[48:39] you were living in amen so what did God
[48:41] do God redeemed that Soul amen brought
[48:45] you back to himself so here you are
[48:48] tonight you're sitting in the same old
[48:51] house amen yes amen uh uh uh sin has
[48:55] you've taken down a lot of the amen the
[48:58] the the the things that on your old
[49:00] house that that that God doesn't approve
[49:03] of Amen but you're living in that same
[49:06] old house you're you've Sanctified that
[49:08] house to yourself it's not a house of
[49:10] sin anymore it's a it's a house that a
[49:13] Son of God and the spirit of God could
[49:15] live in can you say Amen but the house
[49:18] is still condemned the house is still
[49:21] going to fail and you'll never be able
[49:24] to judge your spiritual walk with that
[49:26] house house amen now I now I I I do do
[49:30] you believe that amen now brother
[49:32] Brandon would say he says before the
[49:34] foundation of the world that's when your
[49:37] name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life
[49:40] that's when the lamb was slain God spoke
[49:43] the word it was in his thinking in his
[49:46] thought and he spoke the word and
[49:48] everything happened just at that at that
[49:50] time this is just God's seed
[49:54] materializing that's all it's his words
[49:57] coming down so the reality was back
[50:01] there you were with God you wrot to it
[50:04] you were a clinker off of God if you
[50:06] will you rotated off of God Amen but you
[50:10] see you came in your decreed season amen
[50:14] now you were still Fallen you're living
[50:16] in a fallen body but he says now when
[50:18] the light of God flashes across that
[50:21] quickly the seed recognizes it because
[50:25] it's born of God Amen so when the light
[50:28] of God flashes across that seed it
[50:32] recognizes it and it comes to life amen
[50:35] he says now it's Abraham's seed for
[50:38] knowledge by God that's why the light
[50:41] flashes is to catch that s i aren't you
[50:45] glad for the arms of God that's why God
[50:47] sends a prophet Amen to catch the sons
[50:51] of God Amen to bring you to your
[50:54] potential amen now the problem has never
[50:58] been with the blood of Jesus the problem
[51:00] has never been with the power of Jesus
[51:03] Amen but why is the church in the
[51:05] condition that it has been in amen it's
[51:07] because the church has and and I and I
[51:11] want to speak a little bit on concerning
[51:13] your your position and your amen the
[51:15] privilege of sons to be able to act as
[51:17] Sons why why don't we see the the the
[51:21] believer acting like sons of God and
[51:23] amen with with Divine faith and and and
[51:26] overcoming like you see amen uh like
[51:29] like there should be you know all over
[51:32] the world Amen I I believe a lot of it
[51:34] has been is because uh uh the the the
[51:37] church hadn't come to that maturity amen
[51:40] there's been a few men that has risen up
[51:41] over the years amen that and good Godly
[51:45] men over throughout the church history
[51:47] amen but as a whole the Son of God had
[51:50] never really come to that to that uh
[51:54] that that that conclusion as Adam was
[51:57] that he was a Son of God and that he can
[52:00] is the possessor of all things and and
[52:02] that he can he can he can stand up
[52:04] regardless of what anyone says or does
[52:07] Amen but I want to say this is the
[52:09] season this is the adoption of sons this
[52:13] is the this is the age of maturity this
[52:17] is the age where the son is
[52:19] understanding wait a minute I this I'm
[52:22] not I'm not looking in I I you know I I
[52:25] I preached over at
[52:27] uh there in Arkansas at brother Ben's
[52:29] meeting and I amen and I I I said you
[52:32] know when when we were dealing with the
[52:34] amen and when Jesus was adopted and and
[52:37] he went up to the mountain and there was
[52:39] they there was Moses and Elijah and
[52:42] Jesus and and the disciples were wanting
[52:44] to make a denomination out of it and and
[52:47] wanting to Amen to lift Moses up and to
[52:49] lift Elijah up and amen and then the
[52:52] cloud came down and overshadowed amen
[52:55] and all they could see was nothing but
[52:57] Jesus and in this adoption season amen I
[53:00] believe that's what we are looking at
[53:02] here today amen denominations are over a
[53:05] a lifting man above another man is over
[53:08] uh you know the the the position and
[53:10] rankling for trying to find the ranks
[53:13] listen we've got one position and that
[53:16] is in the Lord Jesus Christ we're not
[53:19] looking to be Amen to be loved by a
[53:21] Manor or to be lifted up in some
[53:24] pedestal in this season we have come to
[53:27] the understanding we are sons of God not
[53:32] sons of men sons of God can you say amen
[53:36] amen oh yes it used to be a you know
[53:39] this one would take you out and you
[53:41] would you would just fall apart or this
[53:42] one you know this one lifted you up and
[53:45] you felt so proud but we're in the day
[53:47] amen where we're not looking to a man
[53:49] amen approval about anything we're
[53:52] looking to the word of God we're looking
[53:55] to God and what his call is for our
[53:58] lives can you say amen amen so the
[54:01] problem has never been the blood the
[54:03] problem has never been the word the
[54:05] problem has been
[54:07] maturity Hallelujah but I'm here to tell
[54:09] you God sent us a prophet and said this
[54:11] is the age for maturity this is the age
[54:14] for maturity amen this is the age where
[54:17] sons of God shouldn't have to be amen
[54:19] reminded all the time of what what the
[54:21] prophet said you know you know get get
[54:25] to church early so that you can be a
[54:27] part Play Your Part in in the services
[54:29] because you count and you're a part of
[54:32] the body or amen you should you should
[54:34] be at church all the time or no we're
[54:36] beyond all of that this isn't this isn't
[54:38] py little diaper changing ceremonies
[54:41] anymore this is sons of God taking
[54:45] responsibility to themselves and saying
[54:48] I am going to stand I am a
[54:53] son can you say amen amen I I'm not
[54:56] doing it for you you're not doing it for
[54:58] me we're doing it because we are sons of
[55:02] God and the prophet has declared what
[55:05] those matured Sons would look like amen
[55:08] so as we look before it was always
[55:12] trying to find a way trying to to find
[55:17] uh a way for the power of God to fall
[55:20] amen if we could I if if we could pray
[55:23] this long the power of God would fall if
[55:26] we could uh if we could do this certain
[55:29] thing the power of God will fall listen
[55:32] we are Sons we don't have to find some
[55:36] way for the power of God to fall we've
[55:39] got to recognize who we
[55:43] are amen amen but we judge too many
[55:46] things by the feelings well I don't feel
[55:48] like it I don't feel like going to
[55:49] church well I don't feel like praising I
[55:50] don't feel it you're you're judging
[55:52] you're judging you are you are lifting
[55:55] your feelings above that of the
[55:58] word so it takes a Son of God and you
[56:02] can only do it if you're a son you can
[56:04] only do it if you've got the Holy Ghost
[56:06] to stand up and say no I'm a Son of God
[56:11] I'm going to live according to what God
[56:14] has laid out for this
[56:17] age Hallelujah now now brother Brandon
[56:21] was saying you know as as I quoted that
[56:24] quote and I bewildered some of you this
[56:26] morning amen and you can say well and
[56:28] this is right before he passed away this
[56:30] is 65 12565 and things that are to be he
[56:34] says you can say I got the baptism of
[56:36] the Holy Ghost he says that still has
[56:39] nothing to do with it that's just only a
[56:41] temporal gift for you now you're
[56:44] thinking now what does that mean he's
[56:45] saying if you're not a son the Holy
[56:48] Ghost will never have its
[56:50] effect if you're not a son well you jump
[56:53] and shout and you'll have all kinds of
[56:55] things he says the real gift is your
[56:58] soul down in there that was born of God
[57:02] that controls this whole thing to the
[57:06] word of God and the will of God and
[57:10] there you will grow up see then you're a
[57:14] son and daughter of God you're a child
[57:16] of God Amen goes on he says well I I'm
[57:19] I'm Pentecostal I belong to that I he
[57:21] says if you don't line up with that word
[57:25] there is something wrong wrong see your
[57:27] real father ain't
[57:30] God because that real start in your soul
[57:34] before there was even a spirit it was
[57:36] your soul that Soul didn't come from God
[57:39] then it wasn't the germ of God to begin
[57:41] with you're deceived you're in a patch
[57:43] of weeds bearing the world's record of
[57:45] the weeds coming forth acting like the
[57:47] world loving the world and it's because
[57:50] the love of God is not even in you so
[57:53] here we stand today as the sons of God
[57:57] Amen what is taking place we're in the
[58:00] age of
[58:02] maturity this is we're not looking at
[58:05] things through rose-colored glasses like
[58:07] children and saying well you know well I
[58:09] you know I well that's just an opin that
[58:12] no no no no we're sons of
[58:17] God someone asked me one time Amen

[58:24] preached 35 years of hard messages and
[58:27] it never changed a person about it never
[58:31] changed a
[58:33] person the elect you don't have to hit
[58:36] them over the head and keep hitting them
[58:37] over the head they're going to follow
[58:40] the word of
[58:42] God so if they want to be in the
[58:45] tribulation or if they I don't know all
[58:47] I know is this is the age of maturity
[58:50] and brother bradam says the tutor is no
[58:52] longer over his shoulder all the time
[58:54] saying you shouldn't do that you
[58:56] shouldn't do that hey hey hey no the son
[58:59] has stepped up to its Rank and position
[59:02] and believes the word as God believes
[59:06] it Hallelujah can you say Amen now what
[59:10] does this
[59:12] do this is not
[59:14] just a narcissist
[59:17] father saying all right now I've got
[59:20] total control over my son amen and and
[59:23] now I'm going to put you over the
[59:25] business but I I and and and he's just

[59:41] I and when it comes to Papa God he knows
[59:45] how to run the
[59:46] business he knows how to run the

[59:51] problem has never been the blood the
[59:52] blood has been there to get us along

[1:00:06] problem today is not in the word is not
[1:00:10] in the power is not in the spirit of God

[1:00:17] we need sons of God to quit worshiping
[1:00:20] their house and understand that they are

[1:00:44] to be born again of the spirit of God
[1:00:46] they don't know what omnipotence means
[1:00:49] what that God in his great omnipotent
[1:00:51] power can transform a soul from a street

[1:09:43] God to do everything for
[1:09:46] us God's given the authority to the
[1:09:50] church the authority to the church is
[1:09:53] for you to stand upon the unfall word of
[1:09:59] God and make that word to live in your
[1:10:03] situation that's right but we can't but
[1:10:05] he can't have you falling apart every
[1:10:07] time amen uh the the the your your
[1:10:10] little world comes to an end and then
[1:10:11] you fall apart aren't you to control
[1:10:13] your little
[1:10:15] world aren't you to control and to stand
[1:10:18] as a Son of God Amen with authority yes
[1:10:22] sir can you say amen amen the beginning
[1:10:24] of man
[1:10:26] has never
[1:10:27] changed we lost it but the commission to
[1:10:31] man is still the same we are to have
[1:10:35] dominion and Authority you say no that's
[1:10:39] going to be in the Millennium that's not
[1:10:40] what brother brandham said brother
[1:10:43] brandham says the beginning of man is
[1:10:46] what God redeemed us back
[1:10:48] to
[1:10:50] now he man he says now man was a
[1:10:53] secondary God on Earth and again this
[1:10:56] was this is found in the fundamental
[1:10:57] foundation for faith that I would
[1:10:59] encourage each of you to listen to he
[1:11:02] was given the power to control all
[1:11:03] things all the elements of the earth
[1:11:05] that was Adam Adam was given these great
[1:11:08] powers and that church do that
[1:11:11] Hallelujah and then that church was
[1:11:14] given to to uh uh but but then the power
[1:11:18] that he was
[1:11:19] given to make his choice is where he
[1:11:21] fell and Adam could speak to the winds
[1:11:24] and it would stop he could speak speak
[1:11:25] to the trees and they' Obey him they
[1:11:26] could speak to the wildlife and it would
[1:11:28] obey him he could speak to the waters
[1:11:29] every what it was and everything obeyed
[1:11:31] Adam that was the beginning of man
[1:11:32] that's what God give him the power over
[1:11:34] everything on the earth now through the
[1:11:36] fall he lost that power then he become
[1:11:38] unconscious of the fact after losing
[1:11:40] relationship and friendship and
[1:11:42] fellowship with the father then he lost
[1:11:44] all of that and all of these great
[1:11:45] channels become clogged up and he
[1:11:47] couldn't get through now what Adam was
[1:11:49] in God Christ has redeemed us back to
[1:11:53] that now a redeemer to redeem anything
[1:11:56] is to bring us back to its original
[1:11:59] again now we know the last thing is to
[1:12:02] be this body but this body never did
[1:12:06] have
[1:12:08] control come on the control was given to
[1:12:11] the soul the body was created in the
[1:12:15] next
[1:12:16] chapter right all right your soul was
[1:12:20] created in the image of God and that
[1:12:23] Soul has been restored back into
[1:12:26] communion and fellowship with
[1:12:29] God now amen but as long as you're a kid
[1:12:35] you're a
[1:12:37] servant as long as you're a child you're
[1:12:40] a it does matter how you Buck against
[1:12:43] the word of God and how you respect the
[1:12:46] word of God and how you come on now now
[1:12:49] there's there's there's there's hundreds
[1:12:52] of quotes where the comforter amen where
[1:12:54] the where where where where the uh the
[1:12:57] tutors coming back to the father and
[1:12:58] says well she bucks your word here he
[1:13:01] bucks your word there he just constantly
[1:13:03] saying well well well Amen brother
[1:13:05] Brandon there are literally hundreds of
[1:13:08] quotes where he's talking about this
[1:13:11] amen I want to say and maybe maybe
[1:13:13] hundreds is an exaggeration dozens of
[1:13:16] quotes amen amen dozens of quotes of
[1:13:20] where the tutors coming back to the
[1:13:22] father and said listen you can't be
[1:13:24] proud of him yes yes they're coming
[1:13:25] along but they're not mature enough to
[1:13:27] take over
[1:13:30] anything praise the
[1:13:32] Lord but that doesn't stop the fact that
[1:13:36] you are a son of God and I say I want to
[1:13:40] be in a Rapture God help me to mature in
[1:13:42] my faith help me to mature to say God if

[1:14:13] Believer meets there's two
[1:14:15] omnipotence a man is a part of God he is
[1:14:19] a Son of God and that's what little and
[1:14:23] and what and what little he is joins

[1:17:47] whatever amen cre of jibway or amen what
[1:17:50] what what is
[1:17:51] it yeah yeah yeah then that in that cre
[1:17:54] there's a mix mixture of him there and
[1:17:56] and he just you just you just told me
[1:17:58] something from the Lord told me what I
[1:18:00] had said and I'm thinking well great day
[1:18:04] I don't know any kind of Korean I don't
[1:18:06] know any kind of OJ Bo but God just came
[1:18:11] down specially for that man who had come
[1:18:14] to that service looking for something
[1:18:16] from the Lord he so desperately needed
[1:18:19] to hear from the Lord and the Lord used
[1:18:22] me and I didn't even I I wasn't speaking
[1:18:26] in cre or a
[1:18:28] Gibble but it was God to a poor man that
[1:18:32] didn't even know English and God spoke
[1:18:35] to him are y'all hearing me Oh Glory I
[1:18:38] think we're too educated we get too we
[1:18:41] get we we think this thing too much I
[1:18:44] say we need to keep our Doctrine
[1:18:48] simple I I you know listen Stephanie
[1:18:51] Stephanie barely knew what the Red Sea
[1:18:54] was when the Lord healed her she barely
[1:18:57] knew anything she just simply believed
[1:19:00] and I would tell her and there she was
[1:19:02] acting like a little child oh just so
[1:19:04] giddy and as we're as I tell her little
[1:19:06] bible stories and amen and how God's
[1:19:08] still the same today and she just oh my
[1:19:10] and I wasn't even thinking about her
[1:19:12] liver I was just tell I was just trying
[1:19:14] to catch her up fast track Sunday school
[1:19:16] on steroids you know amen get her get
[1:19:19] get get her all ready to go so she'll
[1:19:21] understand something that's going on in
[1:19:22] the church services but you know what
[1:19:24] happened it was was that little
[1:19:25] childlike faith and she just believed it
[1:19:27] and God gave her a brand new she was
[1:19:29] only here for what 2 3 months amen only
[1:19:33] here just that long when God gave her a
[1:19:35] brand new
[1:19:37] liver there wasn't a lot of mush that
[1:19:39] she had to come through she just went
[1:19:40] all this time saying that God wasn't
[1:19:42] real amen agnostic atheist and but when
[1:19:45] she found out that God was real and that
[1:19:47] God could do things and she seen some
[1:19:49] testimonies for herself she just says
[1:19:50] well then God can heal me
[1:19:52] too come on simp
[1:19:55] faith I think I think we need to get
[1:19:57] back to that
[1:19:59] Simplicity now our teaching is to get
[1:20:02] your focus not on yourself but on the
[1:20:07] position of your
[1:20:10] soul so even our teaching should not be
[1:20:12] intellectual no please don't be
[1:20:15] intellectual let it minister to that
[1:20:18] heart now he says the greatest success
[1:20:21] I've ever had hardly was those that
[1:20:23] could hardly read or write now I'm not
[1:20:25] support I'm not trying to support my
[1:20:27] ignorance or prejudices but I'll say the
[1:20:29] biggest hindrances the Gospel of Jesus
[1:20:31] Christ has ever had has been this
[1:20:34] modernday
[1:20:35] education you believe that amen the
[1:20:38] first conflict it goes on down the first
[1:20:40] conflict that was ever coming to the
[1:20:42] world was because somebody was seeking
[1:20:44] out worldly wisdom in instead of simple
[1:20:47] faith in God listen to this you say Dr
[1:20:51] so and so don't believe it yeah that
[1:20:53] doesn't change God's word a bit remember
[1:20:55] you're not saved by wisdom you are saved
[1:20:57] you're not saved by your education you
[1:20:59] are saved by faith in Jesus Christ
[1:21:02] forget about your education be simple in
[1:21:06] your
[1:21:07] Doctrine right forget about your
[1:21:10] education and be simple somebody say be
[1:21:15] simple in your
[1:21:22] Doctrine well what is the doctrine
[1:21:28] ABCs what did Brother brandom say he
[1:21:30] said now now he says they said now won't
[1:21:33] you teach them how to prophesy and won't
[1:21:34] you teach them how to do all this he
[1:21:35] says they got to learn their
[1:21:37] ABCs talking about the Pentecostals he
[1:21:40] said I can't teach them all these all
[1:21:41] this other stuff until they get their
[1:21:42] ABCs and the ABCs is what always believe
[1:21:49] Christ there's the ABCs he could not get
[1:21:53] the Pentecostals to believe the word so
[1:21:56] God was Hallelujah now we've got we've
[1:22:00] got a group of men uh uh out there
[1:22:02] they're retracing the prophet's
[1:22:04] footsteps now these are not in the
[1:22:05] message they're charismatic amen and um
[1:22:09] um these These are these are good man
[1:22:11] but they uh you know they're they're
[1:22:13] retracing the prophet's footsteps so
[1:22:15] they'll go they they went you know they
[1:22:17] they've been in Phoenix his last
[1:22:18] meetings there he's been they've been uh
[1:22:21] uh going to these motel rooms and these
[1:22:23] ballrooms where brother brandham where
[1:22:24] the supernatural was at and they've been
[1:22:26] getting people in and and and and and
[1:22:28] they're on they're on the internet I'm
[1:22:29] not you you can you you can you can look
[1:22:31] it up for yourself but these guys are
[1:22:33] are uh are are trying to find the glory
[1:22:37] amen what that Prophet had we can have
[1:22:40] too and so they want the glory and
[1:22:43] they're they're retrac and they're
[1:22:44] having conventions of they're having
[1:22:46] people that were there there's a brother
[1:22:49] bram's Oregan player brother bram's
[1:22:50] Oregan player uh at one of his last
[1:22:53] meetings where amen he's up there
[1:22:54] telling what exactly what happened and
[1:22:56] how how the supernatural came and how
[1:22:58] the god apparently brother Bram was
[1:23:00] supposedly said something to him and and
[1:23:02] uh and and and then you got you got
[1:23:05] these other guys and then there's you
[1:23:06] know there's some of our message ranks
[1:23:07] some some of our message preachers that
[1:23:09] are a part of it too over there and I
[1:23:12] anyways so you know so they're trying to
[1:23:16] re retrace the footsteps and they're
[1:23:18] trying to put these pieces all together
[1:23:20] and and and and and they they've missed
[1:23:23] the point
[1:23:24] this is the third
[1:23:27] pull this is the adoption of sons this
[1:23:31] is when the word has been opened up and
[1:23:35] handed to the Son of
[1:23:39] God but it's never going to do us any
[1:23:42] good if we don't believe the way God
[1:23:45] wants us to believe that's right and you
[1:23:48] cannot say oh I believe I believe I
[1:23:50] believe and you can't do the first
[1:23:51] principles of the doctrines you can't
[1:23:53] even do the first things that brother
[1:23:54] brandom tells you need you need to get
[1:23:58] right
[1:23:59] Hallelujah you said now this morning you
[1:24:01] said adoption had nothing to do with
[1:24:03] works it doesn't it has to do with

[1:29:29] Adam had is because the church has not
[1:29:32] come into that
[1:29:34] maturity up to this
[1:29:37] point right I say

[1:29:59] want but you were
[1:30:01] tutored you've been given the
[1:30:04] message you've been given
[1:30:06] adoption so that you and I can operate
[1:30:12] in the authority of
[1:30:19] sunship come on sure it's good for papa
[1:30:23] to be proud
[1:30:25] but God's given me the keys to the
[1:30:28] kingdom I'm going to take this now my
[1:30:31] prayer is going to mean something now my
[1:30:35] Bible study is going to mean something
[1:30:37] now my listening to the message is going
[1:30:40] to mean something I'm taking this are
[1:30:42] y'all understanding I am believing
[1:30:45] everything that God has put now now now
[1:30:47] look here look here what brother brandom
[1:30:49] had said amen he says now he says cut
[1:30:53] every obstacle from the human being from
[1:30:56] human beings that they might be
[1:30:59] connected like in the Garden of Eden I
[1:31:01] was going to choke it but I'm going to
[1:31:03] say it man is omnipotent you don't
[1:31:06] believe that but he is a man fully
[1:31:10] surrendered to God is omnipotent did not
[1:31:14] he say in Mark
[1:31:16] 11:22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:31:18] doubt not in your heart and don't doubt
[1:31:20] in your heart it'll come to pass you can
[1:31:22] have what you said what what happens
[1:31:24] when two omnipotence meet when God and
[1:31:27] man come together through omnipotence
[1:31:29] something's got to shake whatever you
[1:31:32] say with the creative power of
[1:31:34] omnipotence of God knowing that he's
[1:31:36] promised it he said it in his word it
[1:31:39] creates a power that goes out yonder and
[1:31:42] brings things to pass things that is not
[1:31:45] it makes them as though they are because
[1:31:48] two omnipotence have met there he stands
[1:31:52] isn't he wonderful
[1:31:56] omnipotent this ain't it this you're
[1:31:59] bringing this under the control of
[1:32:03] omnipotence but the man in the house is
[1:32:05] the one that's got not the house but the
[1:32:08] man in the house now now Satan come
[1:32:10] right back around and say but you're not
[1:32:11] a son you can't because you you you know
[1:32:13] the way you know what no no no no no no

[1:32:19] house is fixing to be demolished I'm
[1:32:21] fixing to move into a brand new home
[1:32:24] but while I'm here I'm still a
[1:32:27] son and I'm not going to let
[1:32:29] condemnation take me down I believe
[1:32:32] every word that God says I'm lining up
[1:32:34] with everything it's my desire to line
[1:32:36] up with that word it's my desire I'm not
[1:32:39] Bucking in rebellion and doing all that
[1:32:41] I am beyond that I know that I am put
[1:32:44] here for a reason I'm a Son of God I
[1:32:47] don't care if I fell yesterday I'm a Son
[1:32:50] of God to I don't care if I fell five
[1:32:52] minutes ago I'm a son of God God today
[1:32:54] right now I'm a Son of God right now and
[1:32:59] Satan you're not going to talk me out of
[1:33:01] my
[1:33:03] weapon whether I feel good or whether I
[1:33:05] don't feel good I'm a Son of
[1:33:10] God whether life is upside down or life
[1:33:13] isn't upside down I'm a Son of God I
[1:33:17] have been positioned in this place I've
[1:33:21] been given the word of God the Holy
[1:33:23] Ghost is right here the angels are at my
[1:33:25] disposal as I can stand on God's word
[1:33:28] and believe it brother I'm talking about

[1:33:56] greater than anything else we've got the
[1:33:59] authority through that word it
[1:34:02] changes
[1:34:04] things we believe that word Satan wants
[1:34:08] to come in and try to take your children

[1:34:25] word that God has spoken for
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:30] me the only law that a son can work by
[1:34:35] is the law of
[1:34:37] Faith amen because you are a word

[1:59:18] and and I want to rejoice in the fact
[1:59:23] that he says don't be don't
[1:59:27] Rejoice that devils are subject to
[1:59:31] you
[1:59:33] rejoice that your name is written in
[1:59:37] heaven don't don't rejoice in that
[1:59:40] Rejoice that you've got something in
[1:59:42] your heart remember the first quote that
[1:59:44] we that that that that we read amen this
[1:59:47] is the one that I read this morning or I
[1:59:49] quoted this morning I'm going to read it
[1:59:50] back to you again he says now you say
[1:59:52] I've got the baptism the Holy Ghost he
[1:59:56] says that still has nothing to do with
[1:59:58] it that's just only a temporal gift for
[2:00:02] you did you know that Judas was
[2:00:06] there with the 70 when they came up and
[2:00:09] said have we not have we not done all of
[2:00:12] these things he said even the devils are
[2:00:14] subject to us and Jesus says don't
[2:00:16] rejoice in
[2:00:17] that
[2:00:19] Rejoice because your name is written in
[2:00:21] heaven
[2:00:23] are you hearing
[2:00:24] me because the 70 found that that was
[2:00:27] just a temporal
[2:00:29] blessing their names weren't or at least
[2:00:33] uh some you know the disciples it was a
[2:00:34] mixed audience right we know the 70 left
[2:00:37] the 12 stayed amen and then one of the
[2:00:39] 12 ended up going
[2:00:41] to and they all came back
[2:00:45] rejoicing but he wasn't preaching to
[2:00:47] those wannab bees he said rejoice
[2:00:52] that your name is in
[2:00:55] heaven it's not a temporal blessing to
[2:00:57] you he says the real gift is in your
[2:01:00] soul down in there see that was born of
[2:01:03] God that controls the whole thing to the
[2:01:06] word of God and the will of God and
[2:01:10] there you grow up you're a son and
[2:01:13] daughter you're a child of God he says
[2:01:16] in these things as you come up like the
[2:01:18] mother now you're in vowels of the earth
[2:01:20] trying to come forth you're a son of God
[2:01:21] God coming forth you see the word of God
[2:01:24] I should do this I should be born again
[2:01:26] well I belong to church well I that that
[2:01:29] don't that don't mean a thing I'm a
[2:01:31] Methodist my mother that's good for your
[2:01:33] mother well I'm Pentecostal I belong to
[2:01:35] that if you don't line up with the word
[2:01:38] then there's something
[2:01:39] wrong then you see your real father
[2:01:42] ain't God because the real start is in
[2:01:47] your
[2:01:48] soul before there was a spirit it was
[2:01:50] your soul and the Soul didn't come come
[2:01:52] if the soul didn't come from God then it
[2:01:54] wasn't a germ of God to begin with
[2:01:56] you're deceived you're in a patch of
[2:01:59] weeds bearing the world's record of
[2:02:00] weeds coming forth acting like the world
