[18:52] go-getter and
[18:54] U um we want to we want to keep sister
[18:59] Joe fiser in our
[19:00] prayers um she she got she went shopping
[19:04] yesterday with with um another sister
[19:08] and and it was you know it was just a
[19:10] good time for the both of them needed to
[19:13] to to have a just get out and enjoy
[19:16] themselves and and um well sister Joe
[19:20] fell and um and so um and and she fell
[19:26] good and so that that one arm that that
[19:29] she's not been able or that that she's
[19:31] that she's favored since the this since
[19:34] she has uh uh you know had that accident
[19:38] um you know she's not been able to use

[21:35] Thank You for Your Love in the mighty
[21:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the
[21:40] church say amen amen and amen Let's uh
[21:45] let's look here in the Book of
[21:47] Revelations the 20th
[21:50] chapter or or the second chapter I'm
[21:52] sorry and the 20th
[21:55] verse and um we're going to read down to
[21:57] the 27 second verse we've we've gone
[22:00] over these first uh two verses but um it
[22:05] it says not withstanding I have a few
[22:07] things against thee now this is this is
[22:10] talking to um the nominal Church there
[22:13] in thyra because thou sufferest that
[22:16] woman Jezebel which calleth herself a
[22:20] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[22:22] servants and to commit fornication and
[22:24] to eat things sacrificed un Idols I gave
[22:28] her a space to repent of her
[22:30] fornication and she repented not behold
[22:33] I will cast her into a bed and them that
[22:37] commit adultery with her into Great
[22:40] Tribulation except they repent of their
[22:43] deeds let's go to the 23rd and I will
[22:46] kill her children with death and all the
[22:49] churches shall know that I am he which
[22:52] searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I
[22:54] will give unto every one of you
[22:57] according to your Works amen God bless
[23:01] you you can be seated here
[23:04] tonight we
[23:06] um so we we want to um read a little bit
[23:12] tonight and we're not we're going to
[23:13] read a a few pages and then um and then
[23:18] we're going to uh end with with um 20
[23:22] minutes or so of the Third Church age
[23:25] and uh we we'll play that now we're
[23:28] we're at a we're at a stage in in the um
[23:32] in in the church where we can understand
[23:35] where the Seven Seals come in now we've
[23:38] got the Seven Seals but there's only
[23:41] there there's there's only um the first
[23:44] second third fourth and the seventh seal
[23:47] that that is um that pertains to the
[23:51] church the fifth and the sixth seals are
[23:54] are tribulation seal and the uh and and
[23:57] which and has to do with the Jews but we
[24:01] so we are here we're we're at the th
[24:03] tyan Church age and so we've we've come
[24:07] we we have talked about how they've left
[24:10] the first love and how that they have
[24:12] come through but but now I want to bring
[24:16] on over into that the the black horse we
[24:19] had the under the SE uh uh under the
[24:21] seals first seal there was a white horse
[24:24] under the uh second seal there was a red
[24:27] horse under under the black or the the
[24:30] the third seal was a black horse under
[24:32] the fourth seal is a Pale Horse and of
[24:35] course this is the time that we're
[24:36] living in right now now as as we as we
[24:41] have talked about in the in in um as as
[24:46] Daniel saw the great colossal and and
[24:49] how that there was the image of gold
[24:51] then then then the silver and the brass
[24:55] and then down to the iron and then the
[24:57] mixed iron and clay
[24:59] and and we found that as that was uh if
[25:03] you look there at Daniel in the second
[25:05] chapter and in the 7th chapter you you
[25:07] find that there are there is the
[25:09] structure and then there is the powers
[25:12] behind it so we understand that there is
[25:15] a woman amen she is the great and
[25:20] then there is a power behind her and so
[25:24] it looks beautiful we see that through
[25:28] the two trees look a lot alike it looks
[25:32] like two churches it looks it looks very
[25:36] real they're both bearing fruit they're
[25:40] both Christians they're both they all
[25:43] sing they have altars they have all of
[25:46] these things here but the life or the
[25:49] power behind one tree is that of death
[25:54] it's that of the Antichrist and then
[25:56] you've got the power behind the the the
[26:00] the bride and and that is the power of
[26:04] Life which can only come from the word
[26:07] of God so you've got the tree of death
[26:10] and the tree of life now I know I I've
[26:13] got the tree of life bigger here but
[26:15] really it should be the tree of death
[26:17] the biggest because the tree of death
[26:20] seems to it it it seems to uh dwarf the
[26:24] tree of life but it's the Tree of Life
[26:28] that that God is interested in and so is
[26:31] as we look into the seals now amen
[26:34] because these four seals all come
[26:37] together there's happening uh uh uh
[26:40] there there's there's the good there's
[26:41] the righteous the spirit of God the Holy
[26:44] Ghost and then there's the spirit of the
[26:46] Antichrist it's the spirit of death and
[26:49] so while there is a satanic anointing
[26:52] here and that is anointing this tree
[26:56] there is also those four living
[26:58] creatures that are Before the Throne and
[27:01] y'all remember what the four living
[27:03] creatures were the first one was what a
[27:06] lion the second one a calf the third
[27:11] one uh a man and then the fourth one a
[27:14] flying eagle so so we have amen so a as
[27:19] we can see here uh uh we are we are at
[27:22] the breaking point if you notice this we
[27:25] are at the breaking point thyra is
[27:28] almost totally the the gospel is almost
[27:31] totally out the Roman Catholic Church is
[27:35] now has has now had a long Reign the
[27:38] black horse is is Darkness death it's
[27:42] she has she has squelched the word uh uh
[27:46] uh State and church has married and and
[27:49] now she is the ruler over the Kings she
[27:53] has taken over all of that and and so it
[27:56] has become quite she's she built up
[27:59] quite a monopoly amen but then of course
[28:02] thank God for a prophet amen because the
[28:05] prophet let us know that the one who
[28:07] introduced the black horse was the the
[28:11] the the living creature with a man's
[28:13] face uh intellect and that's when the
[28:16] reformers begin to come out Martin
[28:18] Luther came out with justification and
[28:20] sanctification through Wesley and then
[28:22] on up so so what we see here amen is is
[28:27] it it it seemed like the tree of life
[28:31] amen was down to a nub and the tree of
[28:34] death had taken over but God says I will
[28:40] restore and so we we want to look
[28:43] tonight I just wanted to uh uh uh sort
[28:46] of give you a uh you know uh and I love
[28:48] that quote did y'all anyone read that
[28:50] quote I sent today where brother bradam
[28:51] says justification sanctification
[28:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Incarnate
[28:56] Word believer oh my that just makes you
[28:59] feel really good amen that's right and
[29:02] and and he says in another place there
[29:03] in the spoken word he says it is
[29:06] justification sanctification he says he
[29:08] said justification made room for
[29:10] sanctification sanctification made room
[29:12] for the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[29:14] has made room for the Holy Ghost himself
[29:17] so we've had the baptism of the Holy
[29:19] Ghost but the word was coming the the
[29:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost came in
[29:25] 1906 it made way for the opening of the
[29:29] word in
[29:31] 1963 y'all y'all see that now now that
[29:34] doesn't make it four stages it simply
[29:37] means this amen it means stage stage
[29:40] number
[29:42] Hallelujah stage number one stage number
[29:45] one made way for stage number two stage
[29:48] number three made way for the believer
[29:52] amen that God was looking for at the
[29:54] beginning amen right amen so we're not
[29:57] saying there's four stages or or we're
[30:00] not saying that the new birth is four
[30:02] stages but it consists of water blood
[30:06] spirit and then you've got then you've
[30:08] got yourself amen you've got a you've
[30:10] got a living baby and so this where the
[30:13] age we're living in right now is what
[30:15] God has been looking for all along the
[30:18] perfect word could not come in any of
[30:21] these other times it could not come
[30:23] until a prophet messenger come that was
[30:26] the eagle the e anointing to bring you
[30:29] and I Amen to our fullest potential that
[30:33] God's had in his mind from before the
[30:34] foundation of the world and don't you
[30:36] sell that word out don't you don't you
[30:39] look at that word in you and think that
[30:42] man you're just a little bit of nobody
[30:44] when God called you and ordained you
[30:46] amen and don't turn me all the way off
[30:48] now amen when God called you and
[30:50] ordained you to be a a a a Christian he
[30:53] called you to overcome amen he's called
[30:57] you and the only way you're going to
[30:59] overcome is with the word of the age
[31:03] right the word of the age so we overcome
[31:07] hallelujah amen the the lion Earthbound
[31:10] creature the calf Earthbound creature
[31:13] the man Earthbound creature but it
[31:15] didn't just say eagle it said flying
[31:18] eagle that's that's good because this is
[31:21] the rapturing season this is you going
[31:24] back to your inheritance that God's
[31:26] called you to in the beginning
[31:28] hallelujah it's Sons returning to the
[31:30] authority that God's called you to be
[31:33] that's what he's created you to be and
[31:35] and it's ironic that Satan has come in
[31:37] with with the with death amen and it's
[31:40] and it is it isn't it crazy that we're
[31:42] smarter now than we've ever been that
[31:44] that that we've got we've got so much at
[31:46] our fingertips and here we are right now
[31:49] amen in in this generation with more
[31:52] mind troubles there there there is more
[31:56] uh a mind mind disease uh uh uh mental
[32:00] illness is what I'm looking for amen
[32:02] they're saying one out of three in the
[32:05] world is suffering with mental illness
[32:08] the tree of death the the this this tree
[32:11] that is so big and that is so huge amen
[32:15] it it people are going insane right but
[32:18] here's the tree of life and the tree of
[32:20] life is going is taking you back to your
[32:23] original PL oh
[32:25] Hallelujah I said every devil should be
[32:28] under our feet every devil should be
[32:31] under our feet tonight and when that Old
[32:33] Devil tries to tell you that you're not
[32:35] a son of God you're not a daughter of
[32:36] God it's time for you to tell him his
[32:40] future amen his
[32:43] future the great and the fella
[32:45] that she committed adultery with are all
[32:47] going to be burnt that's what the
[32:49] scripture says they must be burnt all
[32:51] right let's look
[32:53] here now um and we're we're titling this
[32:57] um
[32:59] uh tonight's the reain of Darkness so
[33:03] let's let's look here at
[33:05] 232 page 232 and we're going to be down
[33:09] um to the second
[33:11] paragraph it says sentence against the
[33:14] Harlot past Revelations 222- 23 behold I
[33:19] will cast her into a bed and then that
[33:22] commit adultery with her into Great
[33:24] Tribulation except they repent of their
[33:26] deeds I will kill her children with
[33:29] death and all the churches shall know
[33:31] that I am he which searcheth the Reigns
[33:33] and hearts and I will give unto every
[33:37] one of you according to your Works what
[33:40] this woman has children and she is a
[33:44] if that is the case uh that she
[33:48] had children by her whoredoms then she
[33:51] must be burnt with fire as the word is
[33:53] said that's exactly true that is her end
[33:57] for she will burn with
[33:59] fire her end is the Lake of Fire but
[34:03] stop and think about these children for
[34:05] a moment a woman is the one out of whom
[34:09] the children came it is evident that
[34:12] this woman had children that came out of
[34:14] her but they did the same thing she did
[34:18] show me one church that ever came out of
[34:21] organization that didn't go right back
[34:23] into it there isn't one not one Lutheran
[34:28] came out and then organized right back
[34:31] and today they are hand and glove with
[34:34] this ecumenical move the methodists came
[34:38] out and they organized right back the
[34:41] Pentecostals came out and they organized
[34:44] right back there is going to be another
[34:47] coming out and praise God they won't
[34:50] organize back because they know the
[34:54] truth why do they know the truth because
[34:56] the seal
[34:58] has taken the cover
[35:00] off the opening of the seals the lamb
[35:03] has come give that sent that open book
[35:07] to that seventh Church age messenger
[35:09] he's declared the truth you and I know
[35:12] what to look
[35:14] for he says that group will be the Bride
[35:17] of the last day now it it said here that
[35:20] this had children now what were
[35:23] they they were daughters they were
[35:26] churches just like her
[35:28] now here is a very interesting point
[35:31] Jezebel and Ahab had a daughter that
[35:34] daughter married
[35:36] jeroham uh U the son of
[35:40] Jehoshaphat and in 2 Kings 8:16 it says
[35:44] jehoram uh walked in the ways of his
[35:47] father-in-law he went right into
[35:49] idolatry by this marriage he brought
[35:52] God-fearing God worshipping Judah into
[35:55] idolatry and that is exactly what all
[35:58] these daughters churches have done even
[36:01] as I have pointed out to you you start
[36:04] in the truth and marry into organization
[36:07] leave the word for tradition Creeds Etc
[36:10] now let me get this across in Hebrews 13
[36:13] and7 it says remember them that have the
[36:16] rule over you who have spoken to you the
[36:19] word of God it is the word that rules us
[36:23] not men now a man as a husband as a
[36:27] husband usband is head of the woman he
[36:29] rules her but the church is a woman too
[36:32] and her ruler is the word Jesus is the
[36:36] word if she rejects the word and takes
[36:40] another headship she is an adulteress
[36:43] now you name me one church that hasn't
[36:46] given up the word for traditions and
[36:48] Creeds they are all adulteresses like
[36:52] mother like daughter what will the
[36:54] punishment of the Harlot and her
[36:56] children well it's going to be twofold
[36:59] first he says I will cast her into a bed
[37:02] according to the last part of the verse
[37:04] 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or
[37:07] the Great Tribulation that is exactly
[37:10] what Jesus said in Matthew 25
[37:13] 1-13 there were 10 virgins five were
[37:16] wise five were foolish the five wise had
[37:20] oil the Holy Spirit the other five did
[37:22] not when the cry went up behold the Bri
[37:25] bridegroom cometh the the five foolish
[37:28] had to run seeking oil while while five
[37:32] wise virgins went into the marriage the
[37:35] five that remained outside were left to
[37:37] the Great
[37:38] Tribulation that that is what will
[37:40] happen to all who did not go up in the
[37:43] Rapture that is what will come upon the
[37:45] Harlot and her daughters secondly it
[37:48] says that he will kill them with death
[37:52] or as a
[37:53] literal translation says let them be put
[37:58] to death with death this is a strange
[38:01] saying we might say let a man be put to
[38:04] death by hanging or by electrocution or
[38:07] some other way but this says let them be
[38:11] put to death by death death itself is
[38:15] the cause of their death now I want you
[38:18] to see this clearly so I will take our
[38:20] illustration again of the daughter of
[38:23] Jezebel marrying into the house of Judah
[38:27] and there by bringing bringing it right
[38:29] into idolatry and causing God to deliver
[38:32] Judah to death what that is what balam
[38:35] did too so here was Jezebel with her
[38:38] paganism over there is Judah properly
[38:41] worshiping God and living under the word
[38:44] so Jezebel marries her daughter to
[38:47] jehoram the minute that happens jehoram
[38:50] causes the people to become idolators
[38:53] the minute that marriage took place
[38:55] Judah was dead
[38:58] spiritual death came in the minute the
[39:00] First Church of Rome organized it died
[39:03] the minute that the Lutheran organized
[39:06] death came in and they died Pentecostals
[39:09] come along last and they organized the
[39:13] spirit left though they don't believe it
[39:15] but he did that marriage brought death
[39:19] then the light of Oneness of the godhead
[39:21] came they organized and they died too
[39:24] then after the fire of God fell on the
[39:26] Ohio River 1933 a healing Revival swept
[39:29] the world and it never came through any
[39:33] organization God went outside the
[39:35] Pentecostal groups outside organization
[39:39] and what he is going to do in the future
[39:41] is going to be outside organization too
[39:45] God can't work through the dead he can
[39:49] only work through the living members
[39:52] somebody say he can only work only work
[39:55] through the living members
[39:58] those living members are outside of
[40:00] Babylon so you see death or organization
[40:04] came and the church died and to make it
[40:08] plainer death become a resident wherein
[40:11] shortly before only life reigned as the
[40:14] original Eve brought death to mankind so
[40:17] so now organization has brought death
[40:19] for organization is the product of the
[40:22] double corruptors nickan ISM and balonis
[40:26] propagated by The prophetess Jezebel Now
[40:29] Eve should have been burned along with a
[40:32] serpent for their awful deed but Adam
[40:35] intervened and taking her quickly to
[40:38] himself so that she was saved but when
[40:41] this satanic religion has gone the full
[40:44] course of the ages there will be no one
[40:46] to intervene she will be burned with her
[40:49] Seducer for the and her children
[40:52] and the Antichrist and Satan will all
[40:55] find their place in the L a fire right
[40:59] here I will be getting ahead of myself
[41:02] and maybe I ought to reserve this for
[41:03] the message on the last
[41:05] age but it seems like it just seems just
[41:08] right to put it in right now because it
[41:11] deals so clearly with organization and
[41:13] what it is going what's going to happen
[41:15] through it I want to warn you
[41:17] Revelations 13:1 And1 18 I stood up on
[41:21] the sand of the sea and I saw a beast
[41:23] rise up out of the sea having seven
[41:26] heads and T horns and upon his horns 10
[41:30] crowns and upon his heads the name of
[41:32] blasphemy and the Beast was like unto a
[41:35] leopard and his feet were as the feet of
[41:38] a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a
[41:41] lion and the dragon gave him his power
[41:44] his seat great Authority I saw one of
[41:47] his heads as it were wounded to death
[41:50] and his deadly wound was
[41:53] healed and all the world wandered after
[41:56] the Beast they worshiped the dragon
[41:59] which gave power unto the Beast and they
[42:01] worshiped the Beast saying who is like
[42:04] unto the Beast who was able to make war
[42:06] with him there was given unto him a
[42:09] mouth speaking great things and
[42:11] blasphemies and power was given unto him
[42:13] to continue 40 and two months and he
[42:16] opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[42:18] God to blaspheme his name and his
[42:21] Tabernacle and them that dwell in in
[42:23] heaven and it was given unto him to make
[42:26] war with the Saints and to overcome them
[42:29] and power was given him over all
[42:31] kindreds and tongues and Nations and all
[42:34] that dwell upon the Earth shall worship
[42:36] Him whose names are not written in the
[42:39] Book of Life of the lamb slain from the
[42:41] foundation of the world if any man have
[42:44] an ear let him hear he that leadth into
[42:47] captivity shall go into captivity he
[42:50] that kth with the sword must be killed
[42:52] with the sword here is the patience and
[42:55] the faith of the Saints and I beheld
[42:58] another Beast coming up out of the earth
[43:01] and he had two horns like a lamb and he
[43:03] spake as a dragon and he exercised all
[43:06] the power of the first Beast before him
[43:09] and causeth the Earth and them that
[43:11] dwell therein to worship the first Beast
[43:14] whose deadly wound was healed and he
[43:17] doth great wonders so that he maketh
[43:19] Fire come down from heaven on the earth
[43:22] in the sight of men and deceiveth them
[43:24] that dwell on the Earth by the means of
[43:25] those miracles which he had power to do
[43:28] in the sight of the Beast now now that
[43:31] that second beast now remember the first
[43:33] Beast was Rome the second beast is the
[43:35] US is the
[43:37] USA and and and the Firepower and the
[43:40] all the Miracles in the skies those are
[43:42] were a superpower and uh we're a world
[43:46] leader and uh we we have our rockets and
[43:49] planes and we have all of those things
[43:52] and so but there is but there it says
[43:54] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[43:56] that they should make an image to the
[43:58] Beast which had the womb by a sword and
[44:02] did live and he had power to give life
[44:05] unto the image of the Beast the image of
[44:09] the Beast should both
[44:11] speak and cause as many as would not
[44:14] worship the image of the Beast should be
[44:17] killed I want to stop right here again
[44:19] he's going to get into it but but U but
[44:22] we're not going to get that far into
[44:23] that tonight now remember there's the
[44:25] Beast then there's the image to the
[44:28] Beast right there is the Beast the Roman
[44:31] church and then there has been the
[44:33] organized church and then there is there
[44:36] is the image that has been raised up to
[44:38] the Beast and this is the World Council
[44:41] of churches these these denominational
[44:43] churches that have taken after their
[44:45] mother that are living amen and when you
[44:49] worship heard dogmas and take her Creeds
[44:52] and you you are doing nothing but you
[44:55] you're you're you're just the daughter
[44:57] of your
[44:58] mother y'all understanding so so brother
[45:01] brandom is fixing to show us here that
[45:04] uh um that the image there was the Beast
[45:08] and then here's the United States that
[45:10] helps make the image of the Beast
[45:12] solidify that and that's how that's how
[45:15] the man of sin is going to rule the
[45:17] world through that through that
[45:19] structure through that
[45:21] image it says um and he exercises all
[45:24] the power of the first beasts before him
[45:26] and csth the Earth and them that dwell
[45:28] therein to worship the first Beast whose
[45:31] deadly womb was healed this is the US
[45:34] turning his attention the world's
[45:35] attention to Rome and he doth great
[45:38] wonders so that he maketh Fire come down
[45:40] from heaven in the sight of men did
[45:43] I did I go
[45:46] backwards
[45:48] um well we we'll keep on going since I'm
[45:50] here the fire come down from heaven on
[45:52] in the sight of men deceiveth them that
[45:54] dwell on the Earth by the means of the
[45:55] Miracles by which he had power to do in
[45:58] the sight of the Beast saying to them
[46:00] that dwell on the earth that they should
[46:01] make an image to the Beast which had the
[46:03] womb by a sword and did live and he had
[46:07] power to give life unto the image of the
[46:09] Beast and the image of the Beast should
[46:12] speak and cause as many as would not
[46:14] worship the image of the Beast should be
[46:16] killed and causeth all both small and
[46:19] great rich and poor free in bond to
[46:21] receive a mark in their right hand and
[46:24] in their foreheads that no man might bu
[46:27] cell save he that had the Mark or the
[46:30] name of the Beast or the number of his
[46:32] name here is wisdom let him that ha uh
[46:36] let him that hath understanding count
[46:38] the number of the Beast for it is the
[46:41] number of a man and his number is 6003
[46:44] score
[46:46] and6 this chapter shows the power of the
[46:49] Roman Catholic church and what she will
[46:51] do through organization remember this is
[46:54] the false Vine let it name the name of
[46:57] the
[46:58] Lord it does so only in a lie its
[47:03] headship is not of the Lord but of Satan
[47:06] it finally ends up completely identified
[47:09] with the Beast the riding on the
[47:12] Scarlet Beast distin distinctly shows
[47:15] her power is the guard of God of force
[47:18] Satan and not our God the Lord Jesus
[47:21] Christ in verse 17 it emphatically shows
[47:24] that she will gain absolute control of
[47:26] the Commerce of the Earth for no man can
[47:29] buy or sell apart from her this is born
[47:32] out of Revelations 189 through 17 which
[47:35] shows her involvement with Kings princes
[47:38] Merchants all of whom have to do with
[47:41] Roman Commerce in Revelations 13:14 we
[47:45] learn that the Beast spreads his
[47:47] influence through the image which was
[47:49] built for him the image is made that is
[47:53] made is a worldwide ecumenical council
[47:56] wherein all the organized churches will
[47:58] get together with the Roman Catholics
[48:00] they're doing it even now and it is
[48:02] quite possible this Union will come in
[48:05] order to stop the power of Communism but
[48:08] since communism like Nebuchadnezzar has
[48:11] been raised up to burn the Flesh of the
[48:13] Harlot Rome will be overcome and
[48:15] destroyed take note that everywhere
[48:18] romanist the romanist church went
[48:21] communism followed it has to be that way
[48:25] let me warn you now don't get thinking
[48:28] communism is your only enemy no sir it
[48:31] is the Catholic Church also and even
[48:34] more so amen so so we can we can see
[48:41] where where
[48:43] the uh uh where where we are that that
[48:46] that Catholic church now I want us to
[48:49] listen how many are we doing okay so
[48:52] far now I want us to listen to the third
[48:55] seal and and um so uh sister keys if you
[48:59] can put that uh put put that on there
[49:01] and as I say this is going to be um uh
[49:04] 20 minutes or so uh of the of the third
[49:08] seal and and um and brother brandom's
[49:11] going to be bringing it in tying it in
[49:12] with the church church ages so here we
[49:16] go
[49:34] third
[49:35] horse First Church Hy why the nians had
[49:39] a Doctrine see this the first one all
[49:42] right and then the first thing we know
[49:44] this nickan Doctrine it becomes
[49:47] sanctioned and was right went into
[49:50] action and they crowned this fell then
[49:54] this Spirit Antichrist become incarnate
[49:57] in a man see and we find out later on he
[50:01] becomes an incarnate devil too the demon
[50:04] goes away the Devil comes in and just as
[50:06] that church is that kind of antichrist
[50:09] Church progresses so has the Bride come
[50:11] along amen with different things to
[50:13] justification sanctification baptism
[50:14] Holy Ghost is moving right
[50:17] on only they taken their Revival first
[50:21] and the church has taken it at last
[50:22] their first three years first three
[50:24] stages with them and went through the
[50:26] Dark Age then the third three stages
[50:27] comes a church house from justification
[50:30] sanctification baptism holy ghost in
[50:32] incarnate God made manifest the moment
[50:34] here he comes in as the Antichrist as
[50:37] the false prophet then the Beast then
[50:39] the Dark Age and the church comes out of
[50:41] that Dark Age justification
[50:43] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost
[50:44] Incarnate Word go
[50:47] in and he goes
[50:49] down he goes down the church goes up
[50:52] it's just as perfect as it can be oh
[50:55] it's beautiful I just love it this
[50:57] writer is the same one but another stage
[51:00] of his ministry the first stage of White
[51:03] Horse see he was uh just a teacher just
[51:07] an antichrist teacher he was against the
[51:09] word of God now how can you be an
[51:12] antichrist anybody that denies that
[51:14] every word of this isn't true to be
[51:16] taught just the same as an antichrist
[51:19] because they deny the the the word and
[51:22] he is the
[51:24] word now first stage White Horse He was
[51:27] just a teacher but an antichrist spirit
[51:31] in its Doctrine and its
[51:34] quality it was innocent it couldn't hurt
[51:36] nothing seemed like just going on that's
[51:38] way Satan comes in oh he's slick bird
[51:40] they told he said now you know you're
[51:42] looking for wisdom you don't know what's
[51:44] right and wrong so now if your eyes were
[51:46] open you would know what and said the
[51:48] fruit is very pleasant yeah it's good
[51:51] it's it's Pleasant to the eye you should
[51:53] take it now you don't know whether it is
[51:55] or not do you no I don't but God said
[51:56] not to do it but oh well I know but uh
[51:59] God said he we die he said surely you
[52:01] won't do that just sweet as it could be
[52:04] look what it did watch this Antichrist
[52:07] Spirit rise up amongst the early church
[52:09] a doctrine of nickel adans niol conquer
[52:12] the Ley make a holy name or just well we
[52:16] just want Fellowship while you're
[52:17] scattered out here nobody knows where
[52:18] nobody's at I think we all have to have
[52:20] an organization just be different we go
[52:23] put oursel together we work to make a
[52:25] lodge out of it that's why what it is
[52:27] there is no such a thing as the
[52:30] Christian Church of Methodist that's not
[52:33] a church that's a lodge Baptist that's
[52:36] not a church it's a lodge there's only
[52:39] one church that's the mystical body of
[52:41] Jesus Christ and you're born into that
[52:45] that's right by predestination that's
[52:48] right all the father has given me will
[52:51] come no man can come L the father calls
[52:54] him and all he's give me will come to me
[52:56] so that that's it he just the lamb sits
[52:59] there making s making intercession till
[53:00] the last one comes in the little bell
[53:02] rings and he walks out and takes his
[53:04] possession see so brings his church home
[53:07] his subjects and cast his enemy into the
[53:09] lake ofar and all of his subjects go in
[53:11] there with him and that's it then we
[53:12] walk out in a
[53:14] millennium same riter now this first
[53:17] stage he was innocent and second now if
[53:21] you went a little bit higher a little
[53:23] more than that the second stage the
[53:26] Bible say said he'd be given a crown and
[53:28] they crowned a man a Superman see
[53:31] crowned him and then the Bible didn't
[53:34] call him a pope the Bible called him a
[53:36] false prophet why yeah of course he was
[53:40] be a false prophet by his Antichrist
[53:43] spirit that taught Antichrist against
[53:46] the original
[53:47] word because if you taught against the
[53:49] original word it was Antichrist and the
[53:51] word is God
[53:54] see now after that we find him then
[53:57] crowned when he got crowned now he's
[54:00] very innocent helpless he's just a
[54:02] little fell but then in The N coun he
[54:04] was made it in Constantine give him all
[54:06] the property and then what did he do
[54:09] then he see Satan giv him his throne and
[54:13] Authority the Bible said so as we went
[54:15] through it now the next thing we find
[54:17] out that the devil controls all politics
[54:22] that ever has been or ever will be amen
[54:25] we find that Matthew 4:11 and now we
[54:28] find out then that Satan already had
[54:30] politics but he's trying to get the
[54:32] church so he goes down to dece it he
[54:34] gets his Superman Works him into an
[54:36] organization and crowns him
[54:40] viker a
[54:43] Christ Christ acted instead of God Amen
[54:46] see this guy's a biker instead of God
[54:49] see it's the same instead of God what he
[54:51] supposed to be a Vier under Christ
[54:53] now now when he did that then what did
[54:56] he do then he Satan tuck his political
[55:00] power which he was already over and Tu
[55:04] the religious power which has already
[55:06] been crowned and put him together and
[55:09] then he made him another Crown over hell
[55:12] and then had passed on if they pay
[55:13] enough money to get them
[55:15] out so now he's he's backer over Heaven
[55:20] over prator is he wants to call no such
[55:22] a thing in the Bible see but he had to
[55:24] make something the Bible said he come
[55:26] out of the bottomless pit and returns
[55:27] back the same way and on Earth the ruler
[55:31] now what was he given then first he had
[55:33] a bow but he didn't have any Arrow but
[55:36] now he's got a mighty sword in his hand
[55:39] he can do something now then he jumps
[55:41] off his White Horse the white horse
[55:43] rides on out now he straddles what a red
[55:46] horse
[55:48] blood blood red horse he really rids
[55:52] that one oh sure now he's giving great
[55:55] power and a great sword to kill then he
[55:59] rides his blood red horse we see from
[56:04] the second seal that was broke last
[56:06] night he taken peace from the earth and
[56:09] did kill one another and his own mology
[56:13] of the Roman Catholic Church shows that
[56:15] they put 68 million Protestants to death
[56:19] from the time of St hippo of St
[56:22] Augustine of Hippo until 1580
[56:28] 68
[56:30] million Smucker's great reform if you
[56:32] want to read it gor
[56:35] reform 68 million recorded on the
[56:41] martyrology when one of their so-called
[56:44] Saints got the Revelation that anybody
[56:47] that disagreed with the Roman Church
[56:49] should die as a heretic that's just set
[56:52] him around then boy he went to spill in
[56:53] the blood he he jumped on his white his
[56:55] red horse
[56:57] and he went to
[56:58] ride oh now his great power comes he was
[57:03] made biker of heaven and uh worshiped
[57:07] his God ruler of the Earth by uniting
[57:11] the church and state Together made him
[57:13] ruler on Earth give him a crown over
[57:15] that he could pray the souls out of
[57:17] purgatory he could uh also uh inter he
[57:20] was just like God on Earth instead of
[57:22] God to gather he had great power to kill
[57:28] whomever did not agree with his command
[57:32] who's going to say anything to
[57:33] him Church can't say nothing he's head
[57:36] of
[57:36] IT State can't say nothing he's head of
[57:39] it so they died by the
[57:42] millions all them little Church's
[57:45] brother was busted up and killed and
[57:47] murdered and fed the Lions and
[57:49] everything else
[57:50] see a dragon Rome give him his seat and
[57:53] Authority the Bible said so
[57:57] so he rode his tied red
[58:00] horse through human blood till it become
[58:04] a red
[58:05] horse now John sees him on a black horse
[58:11] he chained something
[58:14] else now I have to to say this just the
[58:18] way it comes to me amen and then and if
[58:21] it come to me and didn't compare with
[58:23] the rest of the scriptures then God
[58:24] never give it amen amen see the
[58:26] scriptures has to ever one it's just one
[58:28] great big big thing like that scripture
[58:32] has to agree with scripture and
[58:34] anything's contrary to the scripture if

[1:03:39] the Dark Ages how many knows that the
[1:03:41] Dark Ages there's your Dark Horse amen

[1:03:52] Believers now that's the reason it's
[1:03:55] called represented a dark horse his
[1:03:57] balances are his scales in his hand you
[1:04:02] see calling out measure of wheat for a
[1:04:04] penny and three measures of barley for a
[1:04:07] penny see actually that is wheat and
[1:04:12] barley is natural staff of life that's
[1:04:16] what bread and stuff's made
[1:04:18] from but you see he was charging for
[1:04:22] this yeah what it means that that he was
[1:04:27] charging his subjects for the kind of
[1:04:31] the hope of life that he was standing
[1:04:33] out to them by making he started in that
[1:04:36] very time of making them pay for
[1:04:41] prayers charging for prayer they still
[1:04:45] do it no venience because what was he
[1:04:49] doing capturing the wealth of the
[1:04:53] worlden the scale
[1:04:56] weighing out measure of wheat or a penny
[1:05:00] three measures of barley for a penny the
[1:05:02] rider on a black horse see he was making
[1:05:07] stripping his subjects of their money
[1:05:10] when the Bible predicts that he holds
[1:05:13] about the wealth of the world as we said
[1:05:15] last night about Russia and all that
[1:05:17] they just take all the money just strip
[1:05:19] the people for everything they got there
[1:05:21] you are now notice you see where that
[1:05:24] old money taken in Church comes

[1:05:50] is charging for the kind of life that's
[1:05:55] his for barley and stuff natural wasn't
[1:05:57] spiritual now it was barley so and uh
[1:06:01] barley bread and wheat bread he was
[1:06:04] charging for that kind of a life that he
[1:06:06] was giving to his subjects charging for
[1:06:09] Prayer by the priest to pray people out
[1:06:12] of purgatory charging I'm taking this
[1:06:15] right out of the history charging for I
[1:06:17] guess it's novenia I guess what
[1:06:19] everybody novenia I guess that's
[1:06:22] something you have to do you know some
[1:06:23] penants somebody have to charge
[1:06:29] that bringing the wealth of the world to
[1:06:33] him into his into the church itself and
[1:06:37] he's still
[1:06:39] riding oh he sure is yes sir still rid
[1:06:45] notice here's the good part now
[1:06:48] notice see that thou hurt not this wi
[1:06:53] arm
[1:06:55] just a little bit of it left but don't
[1:06:58] you touch
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:01] that God now oral is symbolizes the
[1:07:06] spirit the Holy Spirit I'll give you a
[1:07:08] few verses if you want to through
[1:07:10] scriptures Leviticus 812 where Aaron
[1:07:13] before he went ah had be Anointed with
[1:07:14] or you know and and Zechariah 4:12 the
[1:07:17] oril coming pouring through the pipes
[1:07:18] and said this is my spirit or and
[1:07:21] another thing if you want to see Matthew
[1:07:23] 14:25 there was a foolish vers 253 the
[1:07:27] foolish virgin had no orl no spirit and
[1:07:31] Matthew 254 the wise virgin had all in
[1:07:34] her lamp
[1:07:36] spirit Spirit or typifies the spirit Oh
[1:07:43] Glory you get it all right now or tipify
[1:07:50] spirit and
[1:07:52] wine
[1:07:54] symbolizes
[1:07:56] stimulation of
[1:07:59] Revelation oh oh I like to run all over
[1:08:02] the place want didn't wake up the
[1:08:04] neighborhood when the Lord show me
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:08] stimulation of
[1:08:11] Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is
[1:08:15] associated together
[1:08:18] always I got the Concord looking stre of
[1:08:21] that like like that where wine and oil
[1:08:23] goes together all the time see
[1:08:26] when the truth of a promised word of God
[1:08:31] has been truly revealed to his Saints
[1:08:36] that's filled with or they all get
[1:08:39] stimulated why is a
[1:08:43] stimulation I feel it right
[1:08:47] now stimulated with joy
[1:08:51] shouts and when it does it has the same
[1:08:54] effect upon them that that wine does
[1:08:57] upon an natural
[1:09:00] man because when the Revelation has been
[1:09:04] given of a truth amen of God and the
[1:09:08] True Believer filled with oil and the
[1:09:12] Revelation is revealed the stimulation
[1:09:15] becomes so great that he makes him
[1:09:17] behave himself unnormal
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:30] hallu see that's what's matter with him
[1:09:34] now makes some Behavior St unseemingly
[1:09:38] Hallelujah now if you want scripture for
[1:09:40] this just start reading Acts
[1:09:43] 2 amen what hadise they had the
[1:09:48] promise that had been given them when
[1:09:52] oil of the promise of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:54] was p pour out on
[1:09:56] them and was it was scripturally AB
[1:10:01] Vindicated now I see the one of you said
[1:10:03] now wait he told us to wait up here for
[1:10:05] our ministry and after 8 days it said
[1:10:07] well I tell you boys Mark said to
[1:10:10] Matthew I I believe we've already got it
[1:10:12] fellas don't you think so see we already

[1:10:25] them John said I I I believe you Wen to
[1:10:27] wait any longer I believe you've already
[1:10:29] got it don't you and I can see Simon cuz
[1:10:31] he had the keys you

[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:45] until you stay there until Joel's
[1:10:49] prophecy comes to pass until Isaiah's
[1:10:52] prophecy is a Vindicator for with stand
[1:10:55] lips and with other tongues will I speak
[1:10:57] to this people and this is the
[1:10:59] refreshment this is the wine that's
[1:11:01] poured out what is wine in the Bible
[1:11:04] Refreshments this is the refreshments
[1:11:07] that comes from the presence of the Lord
[1:11:09] H hallelujah it's got to be scriptural
[1:11:13] now see Hallelujah so you see wine
[1:11:16] represents
[1:11:17] stimulation of Revelation and when the
[1:11:21] Holy Ghost fell and they seen the fire
[1:11:24] of God fall upon them M that be to
[1:11:27] stimulate him and at first thing you
[1:11:28] know they got so stimulated till the
[1:11:30] people actually thought they were
[1:11:32] drunk but they were stimulated by the
[1:11:36] Revelation the
[1:11:38] God here it is God's Vindicated
[1:11:43] Revelation made plain to them they was
[1:11:46] happy about it God promised it here was
[1:11:50] revealed to them and Vindicated to
[1:11:53] them Hallelujah
[1:11:55] here was the man standing there saying
[1:11:58] this is
[1:11:59] that this is it and there was being
[1:12:03] indicated by the same
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:10] sign there's stimulation by
[1:12:14] Revelation hallah and now they really
[1:12:18] had it then that's reason Peter could
[1:12:21] get out there and say well you man of
[1:12:22] Judea than you that dwell in Jerusalem
[1:12:24] listen me Hallelujah all you doctors of
[1:12:28] divinity listen what I'm going to tell
[1:12:32] is oh how wonderful
[1:12:36] reveal
[1:12:38] reveal they become so stimulated when
[1:12:42] they seen it Vindicated that just always
[1:12:45] does that it always does I see that God
[1:12:49] promised to do a certain thing in this
[1:12:52] day when he promised to break off these
[1:12:54] seals in this last day and you don't
[1:12:57] know the
[1:12:58] joy The
[1:13:01] Glory
[1:13:03] Hallelujah when I seen him reveal this
[1:13:07] stand there and watch it happen amen and
[1:13:10] know that I'll take any person to charge
[1:13:12] he never did say one thing to us but
[1:13:14] what happened that way and then to see
[1:13:17] the joy that's in my heart when I see
[1:13:20] his promise for this last days as he
[1:13:22] promised to do it where I see get
[1:13:25] Vindicated and made perfectly right I'm
[1:13:29] just I you hear me say I feel religious
[1:13:31] that's what's the matter the stimulation
[1:13:34] is so bad I just just about ready to go
[1:13:37] to cutting
[1:13:39] up stimulation from
[1:13:43] Revelation all right they become so
[1:13:46] stimulated over the the Revelation amen
[1:13:50] that they
[1:13:52] vindicate all right the promise th
[1:13:56] M there broke out the joy of stimulation
[1:14:00] till the people said they're drunk on
[1:14:03] new
[1:14:04] one Hallelujah when God revealed his
[1:14:07] promise to him and not only did he
[1:14:09] reveal it but he proved it that's what
[1:14:11] I've always said a man can say
[1:14:13] anything he can just have to say
[1:14:15] anything but when God comes around and
[1:14:18] vindicates that now the Bible said if
[1:14:20] there be one among you who claims to be
[1:14:22] spiritual or Prophet if he says these
[1:14:25] things and it don't come to pass then
[1:14:27] don't pay no attention to him don't fear
[1:14:29] him at all don't fear that man but if he
[1:14:33] says it and it comes to pass amen that's
[1:14:36] me he I'm in that that proves what it's
[1:14:40] me then that little Samaritan woman when
[1:14:42] the scripture said that this Messiah
[1:14:44] would do these things and here he stood
[1:14:46] and did it just exactly what the
[1:14:47] scripture said she said there he is come
[1:14:50] see a man isn't that exactly the thing
[1:14:52] that the scripture said would happen see
[1:14:55] amen she got
[1:14:57] stimulated by
[1:14:59] Revelation is that right she becomes
[1:15:03] stimulated by Revelation when it was
[1:15:07] Vindicated see that's right she know
[1:15:10] that there was we know that Messiah is a
[1:15:13] coming who's called the Christ and when
[1:15:16] he comes he will do these things amen
[1:15:19] she seen it he said I'm he then the
[1:15:23] stimulation started I way she went
[1:15:26] shouting and down through the city she
[1:15:28] left her old water pot and went down
[1:15:31] there and said to the man come and see
[1:15:33] now if you only know the Eastern
[1:15:35] Traditions that's wrong for her to do
[1:15:37] that yes sir a woman of that type nobody
[1:15:40] listen to her no sir see she had a mark
[1:15:44] and when she if she would go down the
[1:15:45] street like that and act like that the
[1:15:47] man of Street pay attention to of a
[1:15:49] brother she had a Word of Life there she
[1:15:52] was stimulated you like Hallelujah
[1:15:55] trying to put a house out on fire on a
[1:15:57] windy
[1:15:58] day oh there's something
[1:16:01] Fanning she she was ready Hall yes he
[1:16:05] couldn't put that out that was God's
[1:16:08] fire she said if you don't believe it's
[1:16:11] so you just come over here where the
[1:16:12] meeting's going on I
[1:16:15] show yes sir and so the man went out
[1:16:19] there and he didn't do it one more time
[1:16:22] but they know something happened to that
[1:16:23] woman she was changed so they believed
[1:16:26] him yes sir they believed on him because
[1:16:29] Faith cometh by hearing hearing the
[1:16:32] promise of God the word of God and watch
[1:16:35] it being made real because it's a seed
[1:16:38] and when it's sewed it'll take life
[1:16:40] it'll produce just what it's talking
[1:16:41] about if it doesn't then it doesn't got
[1:16:43] seed PR the name of the Lord or the SE
[1:16:46] didn't know how to sew it he wasn't a
[1:16:47] sin of God to se seeds he might be
[1:16:49] sewing them on top of a rock or
[1:16:51] something so you so you see the SAR gr
[1:16:55] the seed God takes care of it it falls
[1:16:56] in the right
[1:16:58] place oh

[1:20:55] my
[1:20:57] 9:30 well to the best of my
[1:21:01] understanding and the best of that I
[1:21:05] know of and with all that I believe in
[1:21:09] my heart that's the true meaning of
[1:21:13] those three seals I want to thank God
[1:21:16] for it I'll say this that it's a
[1:21:20] revelation that he gave
[1:21:23] me he gave that to me the revelation of
[1:21:27] and I do believe that we're living in
[1:21:30] the last
[1:21:31] days tomorrow night we're take that pale
[1:21:34] horse rider and now I don't know I do
[1:21:38] not know God knows that's true I do not
[1:21:41] know one thing about it no I looked up
[1:21:45] my old context I had years ago I seen
[1:21:48] brother Grim Snelling a while ago I
[1:21:49] might have went out but I remember when
[1:21:51] I was preaching here before I looked up
[1:21:53] to see what I said years ago one day I
[1:21:56] was going through Book of Revelations I
[1:21:57] took all four horse riders one time I
[1:22:00] said the White Horse that was the early
[1:22:02] church no out I read that out the book
[1:22:04] of the Adventist and I read something
[1:22:06] isah the early church it went forth
[1:22:07] concerete and the next was a black horse
[1:22:10] I said I forget not what I call that
[1:22:12] black horse I said um or the red horse
[1:22:14] rather I said that horse was probably
[1:22:16] mean that that trouble was on the road
[1:22:18] it going to mean a lot of Wars going to
[1:22:20] hang up or something like that I said
[1:22:22] probably it be a lot of War I said
[1:22:24] that's why the they be then I said the
[1:22:25] the pale hor or the the black horse I
[1:22:29] said that that means that that maybe
[1:22:31] there'll come a black time on earth when
[1:22:33] all the stars will quit shining the sun
[1:22:35] will go down and moon won't give its
[1:22:37] light I said that's probably what that
[1:22:39] means I said The Pale Horse it means a
[1:22:41] lot of sickness is coming
[1:22:43] on I don't know what it means but that's
[1:22:45] that was my interpretation of it then
[1:22:47] because I just took it best I could stay
[1:22:49] here in the pull pit but oh I almost
[1:22:52] said something all right
[1:22:56] Hallelujah glory to God hallu oh you
[1:23:00] you'll see we watching
[1:23:04] now oh aren't we happy for this hour
[1:23:07] that
[1:23:09] we and we see all this thing heading up
[1:23:12] I think nations are
[1:23:15] breaking Israel's Awakening the signs
[1:23:20] that the prophets for
[1:23:22] told the Gentiles days numbered with
[1:23:26] Harrows and cumed return oh disperse to
[1:23:30] your
[1:23:31] own the day of redemption is
[1:23:36] near man's hearts are failing for
[1:23:42] fear be filled with the spirit your
[1:23:46] lamps trimmed and
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:49] clear look
[1:23:51] up your Redemption is here
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:24:01] oh so you can see how that the how that
[1:24:04] the seals all tie in with those Church
[1:24:09] ages and and the church ages is dealing
[1:24:12] with that
[1:24:13] church but then and that was in in 1960
[1:24:17] when the lord gave brother brandom the
[1:24:19] Revelation on the seven Church ages and
[1:24:22] divinely uh give him the the um the
[1:24:27] dates and
[1:24:29] um and The
[1:24:32] Messengers and then of course then we
[1:24:34] could see uh through the seals the
[1:24:37] opening of the seals you can see the
[1:24:40] Mysteries behind those churches what
[1:24:44] caused those churches uh that church to
[1:24:47] progress in the way that it has so and
[1:24:51] and as and as uh brother Brenham brought
[1:24:53] out it's the same Rider on each one of
[1:24:56] those horses so it was the same
[1:25:00] Rider that looked innocent that looked
[1:25:03] uh harmless you know as he as he said it
[1:25:06] had a bow without any arrows he says but
[1:25:10] later on it was given a crown and he
[1:25:13] began to con and he conquered and began
[1:25:16] to conquer so and then and then of
[1:25:18] course he uh and then he jumps off the
[1:25:21] white to that red Slaughters and then he
[1:25:24] he then he reigns uh almost a millennial
[1:25:27] uh there uh the Catholic church for 900
[1:25:31] and something years and um you know they
[1:25:35] introduced any kind of a Doctrine they
[1:25:37] wanted to and they they done um cuz I
[1:25:42] guarantee you you ain't going to find
[1:25:43] none of their none of their uh doctrines
[1:25:46] and dogmas in the
[1:25:47] Bible but yet they're
[1:25:50] still the that they are still the
[1:25:55] uh
[1:25:57] um leader of of all the Christian
[1:26:01] churches I mean you look them up on the
[1:26:03] internet and they've got oh my word they
[1:26:05] are still the
[1:26:07] largest and um and so um and we're going
[1:26:12] to find out as as we go on that he
[1:26:14] changed his tactics because when when
[1:26:18] Martin Luther came out with
[1:26:19] justification and started that
[1:26:22] Reformation um it it broke that chain
[1:26:26] and that anointing that man AG anointing
[1:26:29] again you know if you look there at the
[1:26:31] man and then all of a sudden you know
[1:26:33] justification come Luther started uh uh
[1:26:37] you know uh translating scriptures and
[1:26:40] then all of these others begin to start
[1:26:42] translating and getting into the the
[1:26:44] people's hand and that it it that
[1:26:47] lost uh Rome lost its its Authority and
[1:26:51] the Kings begin to Buck and just it was
[1:26:53] the anointing of the age so Satan so the
[1:26:56] Roman Church knew that it had lost its
[1:27:00] hold or or Satan knew he had lost its
[1:27:03] hold through that Roman church so he had
[1:27:06] to change his tactics so then he started
[1:27:09] coming in and and and seducing the
[1:27:11] daughters and started seducing the the
[1:27:15] the Lutheran Church and she fell then he
[1:27:17] said started seducing these other
[1:27:19] churches until they had all fallen and
[1:27:22] and adopted their own stuff until here
[1:27:24] we are today into
[1:27:28] until every Church denominational that
[1:27:32] that that one time protested the
[1:27:34] Catholic church because it was nothing
[1:27:37] but dogma and now their churches are
[1:27:39] nothing they're they're Plum full of
[1:27:41] Dogma Plum full of opinion and God's not
[1:27:45] there they're dead but there is a bride
[1:27:48] and that bride will walk with God in the
[1:27:52] purity of heart walk with God in the
[1:27:55] Purity amen of his holy spirit amen do
[1:27:59] you love
[1:28:00] him amen is't that just
[1:28:03] wonderful
[1:28:10] amen I want to read uh uh this there're
[1:28:13] in 359 as we as we close the musicians
[1:28:15] can
[1:28:16] come uh page 359 and one it says now we
[1:28:20] see why there were two Vines
[1:28:24] one true and one false now we can see
[1:28:28] why Abraham had two sons one after the
[1:28:31] flesh that persecuted Isaac one after
[1:28:34] promise now we can see how that out of
[1:28:38] the same two parents the same parents
[1:28:41] two boys came forth as twins one knowing
[1:28:45] and loving the things of God and the
[1:28:48] other knowing much of the same
[1:28:50] truth but not of that same spirit and
[1:28:54] hence persecuted the child that was
[1:28:59] elect God does not reprobate for the
[1:29:02] sake of rep
[1:29:03] probation he rep probated for the sake
[1:29:05] of the
[1:29:06] elect elect cannot persecute elect elect
[1:29:10] cannot harm elect it is the reprobates
[1:29:14] that persecute and destroys the elect
[1:29:17] all those reprobates are religious they
[1:29:19] are smart they are of the C line the
[1:29:22] serpent seed they build their babbles
[1:29:25] they build their cities they build their
[1:29:27] Empires all the while calling on
[1:29:30] God they hate the true seed they will do
[1:29:33] all they can even in the name of the
[1:29:35] Lord to destroy God's elect
[1:29:38] ones but they are
[1:29:41] needed they are needed what is the chaff
[1:29:44] to the wheat no chaff no
[1:29:47] wheat but at the end what happens to the
[1:29:50] chaff it is burned with fire
[1:29:51] unquenchable and the wheat where is it
[1:29:55] it is gathered in his Garner it is where
[1:29:58] he is oh elect of God beware study
[1:30:02] closely be careful work out your
[1:30:06] salvation with fear and trembling rely
[1:30:09] upon God and not your and and be strong
[1:30:11] in his might your adversary the devil is
[1:30:14] even now going about like a roaring lion
[1:30:16] seeking whom he may devour watch under
[1:30:19] prayer and be
[1:30:21] steadfast This is the End Time both the
[1:30:23] true and the false Vine are coming into
[1:30:26] maturity but before the wheat matures
[1:30:29] those ripened tears must be bound for
[1:30:31] the burning SE they are all joining the
[1:30:34] World Council of churches that is The
[1:30:37] Binding soon the garnering of the wheat
[1:30:40] will come but right now the two Spirits
[1:30:42] are at work in two Vines come out from
[1:30:46] among the
[1:30:47] Terrors start to overcome the way that
[1:30:50] you may be considered praiseworthy for
[1:30:52] your lord and fit to Reign and Rule with
[1:30:56] him and and and he uh let me just read u
[1:31:01] a little bit more down this page here he
[1:31:03] says to him that overcometh I will grant
[1:31:05] to sit with me in my throne even as I am
[1:31:08] overcome and set down with my father in
[1:31:10] his throne now what are we to overcome
[1:31:13] this is the normal question to ask here
[1:31:16] but that is not the actual thought of
[1:31:17] this verse for it is not so much what we
[1:31:20] are to
[1:31:21] overcome but how we are to overcome
[1:31:24] now this is logical for does it matter
[1:31:27] what we are to overcome as long as we
[1:31:29] know how to
[1:31:31] overcome a quick look at the scriptures
[1:31:34] which involves the Lord Jesus overcoming
[1:31:36] will bring out the truth of this
[1:31:39] proposition in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus
[1:31:41] is tempted of the devil he overcome the
[1:31:44] personal Temptations of Satan by the
[1:31:46] word by the word only in each of the
[1:31:49] three major trials that corresponded
[1:31:51] exactly to the temptation of the Garden
[1:31:54] of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust
[1:31:57] of the eye the pride of life Jesus
[1:32:00] overcome by the word he fell to the
[1:32:03] personal Temptation Of Satan by failing
[1:32:06] to use the word Adam fell in direct
[1:32:09] Disobedience to the word but Jesus
[1:32:12] overcome by the word and right now let
[1:32:16] me say
[1:32:18] this say that this is the only way to be
[1:32:21] an overcomer also it is the only way you
[1:32:24] can know if you are
[1:32:25] overcoming because the word Can't Fail
[1:32:29] somebody say the word Can't Fail now
[1:32:33] notice again how Jesus overcome the
[1:32:35] world systems of religion when he was
[1:32:37] repeatedly badgered by theologians of
[1:32:39] his day and he constantly applied the
[1:32:41] word he spoke only what the father gave
[1:32:44] him to speak there was not a time when
[1:32:46] the world was utterly confused by his
[1:32:48] wisdom for it was the wisdom of God in
[1:32:51] his own personal life Contin ending with
[1:32:54] himself he overcame obedience by the
[1:32:57] word of God in Hebrews 5:7 it says who
[1:33:02] in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:33:04] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:33:07] with strong
[1:33:14] cryingsad he feared though he were a son
[1:33:17] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:33:19] that he suffered and being made perfect
[1:33:24] he become the perf the author of Eternal
[1:33:26] salvation unto all them that obey him
[1:33:29] what was he obedient to the word of God
[1:33:33] now then there will not be one person
[1:33:35] who will sit in the Throne of the Lord
[1:33:37] Jesus unless he has been living that
[1:33:39] word your prayers your fastings your
[1:33:43] repentances no matter what you present
[1:33:45] to God none of that will gain you the
[1:33:47] privilege of sitting in that Throne it
[1:33:50] will only be granted to the word bride
[1:33:54] as the Throne of the king is shared with
[1:33:55] the queen because she is United to him
[1:33:58] so only they who are of that word even
[1:34:02] as he is of that word shall Throne uh
[1:34:06] share the throne with
[1:34:10] him can you say
[1:34:13] Amen
