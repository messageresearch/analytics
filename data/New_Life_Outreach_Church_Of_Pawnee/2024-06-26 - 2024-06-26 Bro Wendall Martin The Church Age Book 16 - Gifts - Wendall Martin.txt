brother Donald's grandchildren with us here at least one both and uh just good to see everyone here tonight in the presence of the Lord and uh amen I if you have your Bibles we can look here in the Book of Revelations and uh so I I think brother uh Ken and and maybe uh even brother Mitch are are Bachelors for a uh a week or so amen and so we we got to really pray for those two brothers amen and um I think um they went home with u with Becky with brother um Ken's daughter and uh so anyways we're missing them here tonight praise the lord well are are are you glad you're a Christian tonight amen I'm so glad to be a Christian so glad um we want to look here in the Book of Revelations and we're just going to read um that 12th verse of the second chapter and um then we'll let you have your seats it says to the angel of the church in pergamus these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for your blessings upon Our Lives Lord and what you have sown in our lives the seeds that you have sown in us and I I thank you Lord for eternal life and and what that means to us Lord as as your sons Lord as we see this world that is just full of Decay and Lord it's just the kingdoms are are ready to topple over father we're so thankful for the source of life we're so thankful Lord that you have Lord given us that new birth and given us a promise of life after this one father now Lord we're asking that you would be with us tonight as we Minister on your word and study uh there in the church ages Lord just ask that you would just give us all give us revelation of of what you are and what you are saying to the church and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight amen um good to see Dad here he hasn't hadn't felt good and so it's good to see you in church tonight dad and amen God bless you and um we did have we had wonderful uh Services there in in um Saskatoon Saskatchewan and so we're sure thankful to the Lord for that and brother Jonas and and brother Kelly um wanted us to send our greetings to everyone here at the church and and um uh they they uh I mean they ask by name however want is doing I mean those guys have got memories and uh then brother Merl they they asked how you were doing and so and uh so um but we had wonderful wonderful Services there and we're so thankful to see the Saints um uplifted in their Spirits so tonight we want to read in on um we're going to read here in book or in on page 166 and we're we're going to start here at the second paragraph and um uh some of you might have noticed that last time we had skipped a couple of pages um those of you that are that that are uh following closely and um uh so we we read from 171 the other night and read a couple of pages there and I skipped it because I I wanted to um I I I well that night I I wanted to deal with thoughts and and um uh how that if this word is going to be anything or if this message is going to be anything amen sometimes we we think that it's um it's all a supernatural act of God the supernatural act of God is what he done in your soul amen that's the new birth but you have to choose to think the right thoughts because it's got to come through this right here and this right here to get down into here can you say Amen so what you read and what you choose to listen to this Soul either agrees or doesn't agree amen and when our soul gets real swampy it starts letting anything inside there and and you don't want that you want your soul Amen to filter those things in our lives but tonight and maybe the next couple of us Wednesday nights we're going to deal with gifts gifts of the Spirit and um um because brother brandham talks a lot about the gifts in the Church age and in his ministry and and we understand that that brother brandham was not against the gifts but he was for sure um uh telling us that they need to be operated right and that they that that you cannot you you can speak in tongues all over the and and and and U and prophesy all you want and still go to hell amen now and that that's just that's just a fact and so we do not we do not base our Salvation Amen on gifts but to say gifts are not a part of the church then then I would have to say Amen uh because there's a lot of it wrong then I would have to say that I can't preach anymore and oops by the way that's the what what is being taught in in our message circles amen the gifts have have elements of of uh of of of of you know uh wrong and and they're Incorrect and preachers are wrong and they mess up and they do these kinds of things and so uh so you know you know we don't believe in speaking in tongues we don't believe in Prophecy we don't believe in Visions we don't believe in dreams we don't believe in Preachers we just don't believe in anything anymore if you're not careful that's not what brother brandham taught us Amen brother brandham taught us that we are that there will be a church there will be a five-fold Ministry and there will be the nine spiritual gift GI in operation and so but they've got but he also says go back to the scripture and how the Apostle Paul set it in order because Le oosa does not do it the way the Apostle Paul had it set in order can you say amen and so uh so we're going to read here and um amen and and we're going to um we're we're going to read um uh about three uh see one 2 3 four pages and then we'll uh do some commenting and reading some scriptures but it says here in in 166 and we're going to start at the second paragraph but what are tongues and interpretation and the other gifts they are manifestations that is what the word teaches read it in 1 Corinthians 12: 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withle then Paul names those manifestations now comes this very good question and I know you are all anxious to ask why isn't the manifestation an Evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost because surely you could not manifest the Holy Ghost unless you were truly Spirit-filled now I wish I could say that is right but I don't like to hurt people's feelings or because I don't like to hurt people's feelings or walk on their Doctrine but I wouldn't be a true servant of God if I didn't tell you the whole counsel of God this is that is right is it not just let us take a little look at balum he was religious he worshiped God he understood the prophet the proper method of sacrificing and worship and approaching unto God but he was not a true seed Prophet for he took the wages of unrighteousness and worst of all he led the people of God into sin and fornication of fornication and idolatry yet who would dare to deny that the spirit of God manifested through him in in one of the most beautiful portions of absolutely accurate prophecy the world has ever seen but he never had the Holy Ghost now then what do you think about Caiaphas the high priest the Bible says he prophesied the kind of death the Lord should die we all know there is no record of him being a spirit spirit filled spirit-led man like dear o Simeon or that sweet an uh uh the sweet Saint the an Anna yet he had a genuine manifestation of the Holy Ghost we can we we cannot deny that so where is the manifestation as an Evidence it isn't there if you are truly filled with the spirit of God you will have the evidence of the word in your life can I hear an amen so if you're spirit filled what we're looking for is the evidence of the word in our lives now let's show you uh let's show you how deeply I feel and understand this Truth by a revelation God gave to me gave me now before I tell it I want to say this many of you people believe me to be a prophet I don't say that I am you have said it but you but we both know that the visions God gives me never fail not once if anyone can prove a vision ever failed I want to know about it now that you follow me this far here is my story many years ago I came across the Pentecostal people I was in one of their camp meetings where there was much manifestation of tongues interpretation of tongues and prophecy two preachers in particular were engaged in this kind of speaking more than any of the other brethren I thoroughly enjoyed the services and was truly interested in the various manifestations they had a ring of reality to them it was my Earnest desire to learn all that I could about these gifts so I decided to talk to the two men about them through the gift of God resident in me I sought to know the spirit in the first man whether he was truly of God or not after their brief conversation uh after a brief conversation with that sweet humble brother I knew he was a genuine solid Christian he was real the next young man was not at all like the first one he was boastful and proud and as I spoke to him a vision moved across my eyes and I saw that he was married to a PL blonde lady lady but living with a brunette who had two children by her if I have if there were ever a hypocrite he was one let me tell you I was shocked how could I how could uh how could I not be here were two men one of them was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the Spirit I was troubled by this confusion I left the meetings to seek God for the answer I went alone to a secret place and there with my Bible I prayed and waited on the Lord for the answer not knowing just what portion of scripture to read I casually open this the Bible to some place in Matthew I read for a while and then laid the Bible down in a moment a wind blew into the room and turned the pages of the Bible to Hebrews the 6th chapter I read it through and was particularly impressed by those strange verses in Hebrews 6:4 to9 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs for them by uh whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from the from God and that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh un cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak amen so how many understands what he is saying there now he was he's talking about the thorns and he's talking about the real and and and he says the thorns and the real all GA the same thing he he he you you he says that you he says they were made partakers of the Holy Ghost they've tasted of the word of God and the powers of the world to come they have tasted these things and it's brought them forth and they've grown but it's not produced Christ whatsoever God's Reign has come upon it God's word has been has fallen upon it amen they have tasted of that good life that good power of that world to come and yet amen they are bearing thorns and thistles they they they will be rejected so so you can have the Holy Spirit to to come upon you amen and and and um amen you you you the reason why we don't put emphasis on the gifts and and it in in and and to be honest with you amen it it's because of this and me coming from a Pentecostal background that that maybe I have done the church an injustice by by not uh uh really uh bringing out the gifts a little bit more and and teaching on them and showing you in the scripture that that the gifts are all right they're not wrong they are God's Heavenly gifts but devil are coming in in this last day and they're imitating those gifts and when they imitate the gifts amen they look spiritual they cry they they they dance they they they have visions dreams gifts prophecies and a lot of them do come true but they're evil they're devils and so we don't want we don't want the church amen uh uh you know uh um leaning on on gifts as if it's your spirituality because it does not make you amen a Son of God it does not mean you have the the Holy Ghost can you say Amen now I'll share a little bit more as we go but he says I closed the Bible laid it down and meditated a while and prayed some more I still had no answer I again to open the Bible aimlessly but did not uh but did not read suddenly the wind blew into the room again and once more the pages turned to Hebrews six and remain there as the wind ceased I read those words over again and when I did then the spirit of God came into the room and I beheld a vision I saw in the vision a man dressed in the purest white who went forth with a freshly plowed field and sold grain it was a bright day the sewing was done in the morning but late in at night after the sewer in White had gone a man in Black came and steeply solded some more seed amongst that which the man in White had sold the days went by the Sun and Rain blessed the ground and one day there appeared grain how fine it was but a day later appeared the tears and the wheat and tears grew together they partook of the same nourishment of the same soil they drank in the same sun and Rain one day then one day the skies turned brass and the plants all begin to droop and to die I heard the wheat lift their heads and cry to God for rain the tears also lifted up their voices and pleaded for rain then the skies darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lifted up their voices and cried in adoration praise the Lord and to my wonderment I heard the revived tears also look up and say hallelujah then I knew the truth of the camp meeting and the vision the parable of the swer and the seed the sixth chapter of Hebrews and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all became wonderfully clear the s in white was the Lord the s in Black was the devil the world was the field the seeds were people elect and repeate both partook of the same nourishment water and Sun both prayed both received help from God he maketh his Reign and son to fall on both good and evil and although they both had the same wonderful blessings and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still that one great difference they were of different seed here also was the answer to to Matthew 7:21-23 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity Jesus does not deny that they did Mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by the way of men but he did deny ever knowing them they weren't backslide these weren't backsliders they were Wicked unregenerate rebates they were the seed of Satan there it is you can't claim the manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born spirit filled no sir I will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Ghost doing Mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations W now this is this is pretty incredible amen because and and again again uh uh we will we will uh uh do the three circles here praise the Lord so so you have got the um let's see this this here I didn't put that big enough that's soul spirit and here's body so here's here's the so they're in the middle you already know these things so if you can't read it you'll know what it is amen so here's the soul now God's design was to come in for Adam he was to rule this is the image that God created in Adam out of that's the image of God now God created him a body and gave him a spirit and that spirit is his mind it's his affections it's it's it's it's a spirit realm that you cannot see that's what makes him who he is God's design was to move on the inside of of this man here and live his desires his life through his thought process his Spirit man as well as his body that was God's Great design amen so what God does through the new birth that's what he does he comes in cleans out the throne room of the heart cleans it all out he moves on the inside he begins to think you you begin to think his thoughts you begin to act his ways you begin to meditate on the right things you amen your memory is you everything is direct directed by that Soul this Spirit Rim becomes in contact and because of that you entertain Angels amen God's living in you he is he is now you're able to come to church and you feel his presence you come when the word is being preached the soul agrees amen but the soul now the soul in itself amen it it it can't express like it wants to so it has the spirit there here's where your personality is that's the reason why every one of us are all different in our personalities that's the reason why we can all receive the word and someone will shout someone else will cry amen that's your spirit man amen but it is being influenced by the soul so you can come in amen some of you uh dance the aisles and the others of you just got your hands up in the air and and and and you're speaking in tongues or you there might be somebody else that has it is all the same working of God in that regenerated soul in in uh in your spirit using your personality using who you are to reflect what that soul is experiencing on the inside so that means we're not all we're not all shouting we might not all be uh dancing we might not all but that does not change that the word is not had its effect in that soul and that soul is rejoicing either way can you say Amen now so Satan comes in he sees what God has done amen so he takes the unregenerated heart amen and then he starts and then he just makes him religious so now the that now he's religious he's coming to church amen and he's he's he's learning the Bible and he's learning things and because of what he is learning and hearing of the genuine Word of Life he is learning to yield himself to the same spirit that the man who is Born Again yields himself to come on Hallelujah so this man here can yield himself to the same holy ghost that the genuine believer can yield himself to and will have the same manifestations his heart is is not right his heart does not want his heart's full of adultery his heart's full of sin his heart's full of bitterness his heart's full of envy and strife he's not converted but he comes to church and the spirit of the Lord that is moving in the church he can speak in tongues it's the same spirit it's the spirit real that manifests these things amen he can believe the spirit man can believe he can he can he can mimic anything that the word of God produces because he has learnt Hallelujah brother brandham says those witches th those witches that that uh would come and tell brother brandom who he was now let's let's just let's let's just call this guy right here a witch Hallelujah did I spell that right all right so which dark evil but when brother brandham the brother brandham would come into their presence because she was connected into that other RM she could tell him you're born with a sign tell them the date tell him he's a preacher how can he do that how did how did how did the Simon the Sorcerer well how was Simon the Sorcerer able to tell the people about Paul yeah and Paul turned around and says you are evil in your heart so these men were not converted but because they were able to yield themselves and now this is where I this is where amen I I I think that that that the church the elect of God needs to needs to get it get it together because if the spirit of God can work in a witch and the spirit of God can cause somebody who has an evil heart Amen to speak in tongues and and and even give prophecy and it be accurate like balum like like uh Caiaphas and and and many others in the scripture then how much more if God gave the Holy Ghost for the elect so that he can live his life and reflect through us how much more should we be Desiring that in our walks with God in this last day amen now it's not going to be a public show you know where where guys up here and and calling people out and doing you know and this that and the other and and you know God used a prophet to declare his word to show that was that was God Amen letting the world know that hey amen the this this is real and I want you to hear what this man has to say can you say Amen now but there there there are those things in our lives so I want you to understand that before uh uh uh before we go any further you've got to be so so here you can speak in this is where brother Brandon made the made the statement you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still go to hell that's how it's done not here you ain't got the Holy Ghost here you've got the Holy Ghost here and that's the reason you can speak in tongues and then go out and commit adultery that's the reason you can have prophecy a and go out there and and and and and and wear your makeup and and and wear your pants you ladies and and do all of those things there because you're unconverted but if you ever get this here converted amen you get that real conversion of the heart and you receive the Holy Ghost right here you're sealed into the day of redemption seal it that's that's the ceiling we're looking for and you can have you can have have this ceiling and never speak in tongues a day in your life you can have this ceiling amen and never but you will have you will have one key manifestation that you are to look for that's a changed life a changed heart that believes every word of God can you say Amen now so so to how many understands that does that does that make it pretty clear amen so so we we don't want to say oh I've done all of this and then at that day I never knew you I never had an intimate relationship my seed was never placed in your soul you're a terror you're not a uh you're you're not a you're not a son of God can you say Amen now now to say some of these things um I and and we have already been looking through the church age book and I I I I I want us to go back and look at a few things just real quickly uh um that we have already looked at well that that we uh that maybe some of these we have not looked at but let's let's turn to page 249 just real quickly and um and and then we'll now so so here because we have this then now we've got so many in the message that has done away with the gifts and even the baptism of the Holy Ghost saying that all we want now all we need is just the word well do do you remember what brother brandham said in the invisible Union of the Bride he says the only kind that the word will produce is acts 238 screaming blabbering younging and they don't want that in their ecomic society right so so brother Brandon would say if you say you want the word you're not going to do away with any portion of the word right Hallelujah now hey I came out of Pentecost and if there was anybody that was that when I came into the message and when I seen amen the truth here amen I I'm going to tell you right now I could care I could have cared Le couldn't have cared any less if someone prophesied over me seen a vision over me or anything I was through with it I I I'd seen so much of the other I didn't want I you know what amen I I was ready to send you to hell if you even you even started telling me something from the Lord because I seen so much nonsense right but I was wrong I was wrong in My Heart by pushing by pushing that far off I was in one ditch and I and it was easy for me to come back over in this other ditch it's in the middle of the road there's where the spiritual church is not an emotionalism and not over here saying well I've got the word and I don't need none of those manifestations and I don't need and what you do is you just throw the you you you throw the Holy Ghost right out too because the manifestation of those gifts are from the Holy Ghost and if you want the Holy Ghost you're going to have those manifestations in your church that's what brother brandom said amen so amen so let's look here at at at page uh 2 49 and we're going to go down to the very last um uh chap U paragraph Paul was the first messenger and he said in Galatians 1:8 that if any Angel any messenger any viker no matter who he was if he preached any other gospel than Paul preached let him be accursed Paul knew that after he was gone Grievous wolves would come in he knew that Satan himself would appear as an angel of Light so how much more his ministers so he warns that this gospel would always be the same now Paul had baptized in Jesus name and re-baptized people where uh who where people had not been so immersed he set the church in order taught the proper use of the spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till Jesus comes now I want you to catch that they didn't do away with the Corinth an he didn't say you know you're just a bunch of spiritual babies and they were and he did tell them they were babies but he was saying you got to get it in order you see what I'm saying so the gifts were to remain he says that's the next Messengers and all remaining six would by the same Holy Ghost burn with the same fire give the same light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and signs would follow them can you say amen amen let's let's go on down um just just uh for uh the sake uh let's go down to the second uh paragraph here for the sake of time so we see the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of God working out the will and the word of God in different Generations I would like to illustrate that from the that from the word the spirit of God was mightily upon Elijah then that same P Spirit come upon Elisha in a two-fold way then centuries later The Same Spirit which we call the spirit of Elijah in order to describe his ministry came back upon John the Baptist one day that same Spirit identified by the same manner of ministry will come upon a man for the end of the Gentile Age Again the church says or the scripture says that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and power he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil and Jesus went away as Jesus went away he told his disciples to T until Pentecost at which the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and F them then that called out body the church would be in his stad upon the Earth taking his place and because that same spirit that was in him would be in them they would do the very same Works any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works as Jesus as as did Jesus and the Pentecostal church because the Same Spirit Will in them any other Church uh that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to give an account before God so you've got to have remember where the spirit is there will be the manifestations amen that's God and and and we want to say h well we well well we just don't believe in him well you're going to have to if you're going to understand the spirit of the day amen Spirit of wisdom the gift of wisdom the gift of knowledge the gift of faith these are things that come from the spirit of God Amen these are part of that in and and uh and a part of our Lives now uh for the sake of uh amen um for the sake of time let's go down to the next let's go to the next 251 and down to the second paragraph Yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same the seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church she will have the same the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church there will be tongues interpretation prophecy healings God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has Hallelujah she will be H uh unorganized don't forget that can you say Amen so so there there's there's there's a lot of those things in there now so the reason I wanted to bring um uh these in is is is to let you know now now brother Bram says they will be a part of the church now I want us to let's just turn to the book of um first 1 Corinthians in the 12th chapter here and um I want us to just read uh what the gifts are and with us you know um I don't know if anyone just has has really just read these but there are three chapters in the book of First Corinthians uh that deal with the gifts of the Spirit and and these are um are are incredibly wonderful U uh chapters here and I think I think you could understand a little more uh you know of what brother Bram was dealing with and but let's just look and see what God put in the church and this is what it's supposed to be in the church now again this is not for the backslider this is not for those outside there but when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we should we should um expect to see these gifts manifested in in our lives amen so let's look here in in um 1 Corinthians 12 and 1 it says now Brethren or or now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would have you I would not have you ignorant you know that ye were Gentiles carried away and with these dumb Idols even as you were lad wherefore I gave you to understand give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calls Jesus a curse and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administration but the same Lord there are div diversities of operation but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withle for to one is given the spirit of the word of w by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit and I want you to notice gifts not Gift gifts of healing to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another interpretation of tongues but these but all these worketh that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will now if you'll notice tongues and interpretation of tongues they're not on top of the list they're on the bottom of the list and as we read the Apostle Paul says listen this this is just to edify you and and as we read on we'll find that the Apostle Paul says covet one of those other gifts more than the tongues amen because it can edify the church whereas the speaking in tongues simply edifies yourself unless it has been interpreted amen all right so let's let's read on down for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles Bond or free and have been all made to drink uh into that one Spirit into one Spirit but the B for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I'm not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ears shall say because I'm not the eye I I uh I'm am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it have pleased him if they were all one member where were the body now I'm just just just what we've read right here do you see do you see the error that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost the Apostle Paul is clearly putting out this one's going to do this this one's this this one's this now listen he just put it all out there the nine spiritual gifts and then he says because I'm not the eye I'm not because I'm not now watch watch what he's saying amen he says if uh 19th verse if they were all one member where were the body if they were all speaking in tongues now but now are they many members but yet one body the ey cannot say under the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you ye nay much more those members of the body which seem more feeble or necessary and those members of the body which we think less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant cless for our comely Parts have no need uh but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that which lath which lacked that there should be no Schism in the body that the members should have the same care for one another whether one member suffers all the members suffer with it when one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular God has set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gift and yet I show unto you a more excellent way can you say Amen so so now the Apostle Paul is is is bringing it back in now he takes the body and the different members and he's and he's showing the more uh feeble and and and he's and he's letting you know that we all have our part but then he brings it right back again to these gifts amen do do do you see that now Pentecost says if you have not and and this is this is the way they I I'd say 99.9 believe if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost did did you kids did you did y'all hear where the Apostle Paul was separating and letting them letting all of us know that these gifts are all different and they're all given to different people y you kids understand that you you adults understand that that if you read that's what that's what brother brandom kept coming back to us and telling hey come on come back to the word because the word will correct the issue here but now what you'll never uh uh what you'll never take away is the gifts the gifts are part of the church even though Satan can do it Hallelujah I I remember uh when we were selling shoes and I went into Walmart to go buy something and uh uh and and I gave him a $100 bill and before you know it I had security and policeman all over me and the these guys I mean they were pounding me where'd you get that $100 bill I want to know where you and this that and the other and I I kept telling them over and over I'm a Salesman I was just giv oh yeah you know they tell us who this take us to this person I said I don't know it's just like Walmart here uh I sold a product and someone gave me a counterfeit and and U uh so they harassed me and hounded me and I said listen you can have the $100 bill I I wasn't trying to uh and and the funniest thing is after all these guys I mean these policemen were giving me all this you know what they ended up doing I ended up with a $100 bill back in my pocket after all after all that commotion and I I brought the $100 back home uh to to show everybody but uh but just because just because there is a counterfeit $100 bill does not mean I'm going to quit using $100 bills right just because there's a counterfeit does not take away from that can you amen now let's read a little bit more in this uh let's go to the 13th chapter here amen he says though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy that's one of the gifts understand all Mysteries that's one of the gifts have all knowledge that's another of the gifts and though I have all Faith that's another gift so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffers long is kind charity envies not charity vauth not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is done uh in part shall be done away with now that does not mean when you get perfect word then you're not going to have that amen the we are we are all striving to preach the same gospel that the Apostle Paul preached and he had the gifts but he was saying when that new body comes you're not going to need the gifts of healing the gifts of Miracles when that which is perfect has come now we understand the perfect word has come which is the rapturing church and as I read and as I read that quote to you the other day amen that that word that you have received is creating a body around it and you're fixing to move into that amen it took this message this gospel message the opening of the seals to bring us into that beautiful part amen now it says um for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I was become a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly he's talking about that world in this world but then face to face for now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known now abideth faith hope charity these things but the greatest of these is charity it follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh he speaketh Mysteries but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth utter edifieth the church I would that ye all speak with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth and he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifica edifying but now uh now Brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine even things without lifegiving sound whether they be pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what uh what is piped or harped but if the trumpet give an uncertain sound Who Shall Gather himself to the battle so likewise except you utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without significance therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me even so ye for as much as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts now he's correct his church here the Apostle Paul is is telling all of these tongue talkers seek ye that you may excel to the edifying of the church wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret for if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful what is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit I will sing with understanding also else when thou shalt bless uh with the spirit how shall he that occupytheweb in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding than by my voice uh that by my voice I may teach others also that uh than 10,000 wors in an unknown tongue Brethren be not children in understanding how be in Malice be ye children but in understanding be men in the law it is written with the men of other tongues and with other lips will I speak unto this people and yet for all the they will not hear me sayeth the Lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe if therefore the whole church come together in one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad but if I'll prophesy and there come in one that believes not or one unlearned he he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you has a Psalm a Doctrine a tongue has a revelation and interpretation let all things be done unto edifying If any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or three at the most uh at the most by three that by course and let everyone interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silent in the church let him speak to himself and to God let the prophet speak two or three and and the other judge if anything be revealed to another that Seth by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for the Lord is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints now let your women keep silence in the church for it is not permitted unto them to speak for they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is shame for a woman to speak in the church what came the word out from you or came unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or a spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy forbid not to speak with tongues and let all things be done decently and in order can the church say Amen now so we can see that it is a true manifestation these are true characteristics of the Holy Ghost but Satan comes in and and tries to counterfeit them so as as we have as as we go on uh further uh uh this next Wednesday night we will we will take uh we will continue on with what brother bradam is saying there and how that amen how that Satanist came in in in this church age to counteract what God is doing because he found a way to counteract the gifts and thus amen uh uh thinking that the church has arrived and that's why brother brandham says they thought 1906 that they had arrived but he says but they did not because the latter or the former Reign had to come first which had to be the opening of the book there had to be the teaching of the word first so that that watering amen so that so that the spirit of God could live itself through you you in other words you can have the tongues and you can have the nine spiritual gifts but if you don't have the word the Conquering power is in the word and so it had we there had to be a 1906 there had to be a baptism of the Holy Ghost to receive that word word when it came there has to be that to receive that word when it came amen and if you've got the Holy Ghost the word always comes to the spirit field is that what not what we read here a couple Wednesday nights ago the word comes to the spirit field now those guys Satan want to say it's all over here it's all over here it's in it's in this this this this this this and that's fine and they've all went and they've they they have he he's been successful the word the the word words of a prophet means little nothing to these guys it's all in the gifts that's all right but the elect the Holy Ghost baptism comes to you to receive that word and as you receive that word amen sure the manifestations of the holy spirit's going to be there in your life amen and sure you're going to cast out devils and sure you're going to raise the dead and do Miracles and speak with tongues and have prophecy and there everyone amen as you walk with God they're all going to line right up because it is the genuine spirit of God not on a rep probate but upon sons of God Amen all right so any questions here tonight anything y'all want to add or a question y'all might have praise the Lord lots of reading here tonight amen but but I I um you know I I I got to thinking you know it's it's sad it's sad but maybe some of you kids have never even known that those chapters are in the Bible amen because we We Don't Preach from it much when we do preach from it we we just take a few few little verses but but the the the gifts and the operations and and I I think I think we that the Apostle Paul says I I I think that you should all desire to prophesy that that's that's what he said there in the in that uh 13th the 14 chapter he said I would that you all prophesied you know gifts he says that's that's the thing that am man an encouragement and things of that nature there amen so so any any questions before we get ready to to dismiss here this evening yeah false Christ yes that's right that's right and and and that's the reason I wanted to and and we could have just went straight into that tonight but I when when preparing for this um even last Wednesday night I I thought that I needed to go back um in order for there to be a false you need to see what the scripture is for the real that there brother brother Bram was not against tongues and the nine spiritual gifts he was saying but you're putting the emphasis on the wrong thing and and when we get into that this next Wednesday night you will you you you kids can truly understand that Satan takes that that that genuine gift amen and and and and puts it on that uh uh spirit man amen and there is genuinely they're they're it's as genuine the Holy Ghost as it can be but they're false they're repeat praise the Lord amen someone you know U well um Hagen Kenneth Hagen prophesied that brother brandham was was uh was was going to die okay now I don't I don't take anything that they say is but but this this you know uh they they collaborated uh um um Gordon Lindsay claim that they you know he got he got the he got the prophecy a few months before brother brandham died that that the the great one is is is uh the my Prophet has that he's he's going to leave the scene going to take him off the scene because he has left the word and and so um so apparently there was a bunch of these guys that were all there saying huh oh so they were all talking about the only one that could be was Brother Brad so these guys were saying that they they knew he was he was about to go well okay um first of all all prophecy is to be judged and and um but they had this and so so here here we have it they were saying that brother bradam was going to die they were saying and and and and and that portion came to pass but then they also said because he was because he was a false because he was uh leading people astray and that he was okay do you see how that that mixture can come in how that a a a an unconverted man can get into that Spirit real and can pull things that are genuinely right yeah and mix his own stuff into it that's that that's exactly what those guys done that's exactly what balum done that's exactly what these other guys done and so they're going around you they if they if if they are 90% right and 10% wrong you can't accept it if they're 99% wrong or right and 1% wrong you can't accept it now and that's the deal here in it now Hallelujah if there's men that rise up in our ranks in this in the message ranks that are prophesying and 70% of it is right and the other s of it it's you don't accept any of it don't accept any of it you you you can't now if God is genuinely speaking through a person it will be God and it will come it'll come to pass and you'll be able to hear from God but if there is but if there are prophecies Visions dreams and and and people's having to manipulate these things in order for them to fit and for them to work let me tell you man is mixed up in it and I don't want anything to do with it amen we don't we don't want that and so Kenneth hanen got it right he he got it halfway right good job so do witches amen evil men can be be anointed of the Holy Ghost or enter into that Spirit realm you can do it every one of you if you all spend more enough time and back back in those days that's why brother Brandon preached so hard against fasting amen he said you guys are doing your 40-day fast where you can't and then then you're hallucinating and you're going back and you're he says that you were he said many people got had had had got their minds into such neutral gear amen that they lost their minds by trying to enter into that realm and you can enter into that RM there I mean there there are there are gifted people with dreams and and and they uh get gifted people that can enter into that real but that doesn't make it thus sayeth the Lord but on the other hand you can have a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost within you will speak and bring things to pass will show things to come we'll give prophecy amen and and and and uh you know uh uh I've got I've got a bunch of in the church age book where brother Brandon was saying uh that it's to keep the church clean it's to point out sin it's to bring things under from under cover and showing them to the church so that all will Fear Can you say Amen so so you know we we we we don't we we we um uh we don't want to be anointed of the devil whatsoever we want that anointing of God to be upon us but just because there's a lot of that out there does it mean that some of you weren't born to prophesy some of you weren't born to preach the gospel some of you weren't born to to uh uh uh and and the Lord's one gives it the Lord's one that puts those things in you but the thing is is we got a desire that more than playing basketball and more than playing with with the games and more than the internet we've got to spend that time with the Lord in prayer in order for those gifts to even come out and manifest themselves in our lives but what's what what the problem is amen is is we've put all that stuff away so we don't need to get a hold of God we don't need to line our spirits up with God anymore we just believe the Bible and we're all going to heaven we have been given this word to destroy the enemy of this day and there's going to be those nine spiritual gifts operating in in in every one of us and defeating that devil but we've got to desire it someone ask me well well why don't we see that I said because no one likes it no one wants it doesn't mean that God don't want to give it it doesn't mean the Holy Ghost isn't here it's just that we are a carnal people can you I'm not talking about you as I'm talking about the message we're we're a carnal people amen and and we don't we don't crave those things like they did in in in in the old times can can you you see what I'm saying so so it's it's it's it's Lord Give Me Lord give me whatever you want for me me amen I'm not going to try to manufacture nothing but Lord I believe it's there and I'm just I'm just I'm calling out to you and say Lord I want to see your Supernatural work in in in my life in the church can you say Amen so yes that so we will get get back to that brother Merl because that's that is exactly amen it's the anointed ones at the end time brother Mitch the order of it Sanic justification baptism of the Holy Ghost how that all aligns well you it you can you can align it like that you know um uh you know brother brother brandham took he he took this as as the temple of God he took your body as the temple of God and so you've got there were the three compartments of the Tabernacle just as there's three compartments here and and so the outer courts was your body the inner courts which was the Holy place is your spirit man and then your the the soul is the holies of holies the outer courts there your body that's the the light the light of the eye amen the the sunlight was dependent upon that your your inner court or your holy place that's where man had to light physically light the candles and they had to constantly keep the the oil in it or the fire would go out and and and it lit up the it it lit up that room in there uh uh in in in that portion of the building but in the in this room here needed no light at all in the most holy place was where the Ark of the Covenant was and that's where the shikina presence of God himself abided within so you can go you can use this and type that out justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen dividing the the the Bible says dividing between spirit and soul you're there so so you can what you are built that Tabernacle brother Bram says that Tabernacle was built Amen in three compartments just as you are the Tabernacles of God where God comes in and moves in those things and that's Spirit realm amen that that Spirit realm is is is where the battle is amen that's your mind that's your personality that's that's where if if you're going to have any kind of problems it's going to be with your personality it's going to be with your mind your your your your memories your effect that's where everything's at right there in that Spirit realm amen and the poor guy that's never been saved well he ain't got nothing he ain't got nothing if he's if he's has got the Holy Ghost in there he ain't got nothing that he can do anything with to overcome it and so we line everything up according to that new birth amen yeah um well I I mean justification is justification is is is uh as as real as real can be right right at the first I mean it when God the blood of Jesus Christ when he justifies you you're you are you are Justified the problem is is before the opening of that word the the blood the filter was going through man's man's Theology and man's interpretation so so when you were repenting there was no true justification because you were repenting according to what this guy says or what that guy says or amen but when we reive the fullness of this word and it came down this is genuine justification when we come in and truly come before God and repent of all the denominational thoughts of all of our anything contrary to the will of God as has been brought forth in this day then is when true justification can come and that's when you can progress on into the things of the Lord and and and you know brother Brandon would teach you know how that you know each Church um amen gives their gives their own forgiveness so every brand has their own forgiveness so you can only be justified as far as what that truth is from that church but given this word here we have something to believe and it's a blood that'll cover everything if you're willing to believe that blood will justify you amen as brother Josh preached on Sunday that was powerful that that blood is is is a powerful cleansing agent amen if the musicians would come amen any anything else you want to add or or or ask here this evening praise the Lord yeah they you under the bus under the bus but we just read how a woman must be silent in the church can a woman prophesy yes yes a woman a woman can prophesy and as you were um and it's all put in it's all put in right there together and so um the Corinthian Church was was was um they were they were children just just really children and so we had people prophesying uh you know and then and then ladies giving their opinions and this that and the other and so so the brother brandham did say that yes a woman can prophesy any of she's entitled to any of those nine spiritual gifts asking the questions are are are or or bringing the um um there was just a lot of Uprising there was a lot of controversy going on in the in in the Corinthian Church that was uh that just it was a lot of Confusion And so um they were all trying to be spiritual including the ladies and and so the Apostle Paul was telling them listen let the guys handle this you ladies talk to your husbands at home and U brother Brenham says that's a good idea that's a good idea today Amen Let the men figure it out and you sisters ask your husbands at home and um amen it was good back then question no no no in these kind of deals this is not this is not the same kind of a deal back back in in the day they were it was it um it was a competing for spirituality and and so it was just it was just a a a big confusing mess but but brother brother brandham says in the church as far as um singing prophesying um any any of that kind of thing he said there's that's all right just no the authority and the uh leadership should be to the men and the ladies shouldn't be adding to the confusion you you see what I'm saying [Music] yeah [Music] yeah yeah that's right that's right that's right yeah not not interrupting that that's that's good too yeah where you you know when the minister is trying to preach and and and someone trying to prophesy or someone trying to step up and and ask questions or or this that and the other you know but in this this portion of the service that's what we want is just to be able to U any of you ladies are welcome to ask questions no wonder you ask Kobe to ask the question amen praise the Lord yeah yes that's that's right the the that the that uh the the woman has no no place of authority in in the church she's not to preach or to usurp authority over over the man in in any of the leadership roles or or or any of that kind of thing and so you yield that to the Lord and for sure there is it's it's not permitted for a woman to preach uh in the congregation you know the leadership should be to the man and if you've got questions about about things then instead of disrupting everything all around you and um uh I've been in some of those places where there's a lot of disruption going on by spiritual ladies amen so praise the Lord any anything else real quick are we all clear praise the Lord you can ask questions at home not C me at home amen my wife said I'm going to write your notes real good now amen praise the Lord aren't you glad for the message of the hour I'm thankful for this message ah I I are y'all still enjoying the Wednesday nights amen I I wanted to take this time here and read this [Music] because we we it's just it's it's I know there's I I know there's there's a push for for the gifts back in the church I'm I'm all for it I'm all for it but do it the way the Apostle taught us to do it the Apostle Paul do it the way the Vindicated prophet in our generation has done it amen and I I I listen if God wants to step up I I I I believe what brother brandom says he's not quit prophesying he's not quit speaking in tongues he's not quit we might have amen and I think a lot of us just because we have seen the fanatic the fanatical side of it so much that we don't even want to
