looks different than last time i was here it was just some concrete in the grass so you guys did good it looks great and praise the lord amen let's just bow our heads as we have our bibles open tonight father we love you lord jesus we're so thankful for your grace your mercy father lord you've not gathered us together here in vain father but you gathered us together lord that you might fulfill a purpose in this building tonight father the lord the lives that have been set aside lord and all the efforts that have been poured out and lord all the all the thoughtfulness lord and the kindness father has gone into this meeting lord the people of god have not labored in vain but lord we know that you're mindful of each and every sacrifice lord god i know that you're able to perform that father which has been on the hearts of these people lord coming into these services father and lord as we as we enter into this meeting father this first night lord i pray that it would just be lord an opening not just into a meeting father but an opening into another step into your kingdom father i pray that the lost would be saved father and those that are hungry will be filled father the the sick would be healed father i pray that those that are seeking deliverance would find it in this place father i just pray that you'd anoint each vessel father anoint your word it would just be a perfect harmony unity father i just pray that you just bring it forth as you saw this meeting in your mind before there ever was a trial father before there ever was a time on earth lord you saw this meeting and you saw imperfection father lord i pray that it would be carried out thus father lord you know who would be speaking you know this text that would be taken and lord we're looking for you to just come and manifest that to us this hour father for we sacrifice ourselves afresh at your altar tonight lord ask that you just have your will and your way with us father lord we give you all our strength we're insufficient without you father but lord by your grace father lord that's what we're clinging to just ask you bless your word now bless your people we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen thank you for the songs if you have your bibles the book of romans the 10th chapter i uh just were i didn't really have a title but i was just thinking about it back there and for a few minutes we'll talk about removing all doubt we're moving all down romans the 10th chapter we'll start at the eighth verse but what sayeth it the word is nighty even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen may god bless his word he may be seated tonight i believe that we are we are i know it's been happening here in oklahoma maybe i haven't talked to you personally but i know that the the bride's revival is stronger than it's ever been i know that you're feeling god bless y'all from arizona the bride's revival is stronger than it's ever been it's it's performing what it promised it would perform it's doing what it promised it would do and we're living in the age that we all thought we would live in but now we're here so we recognize that we're in the age of the bride's revival we're not in another age or an age gone by but we're in the right age at the right time for a rapture i believe that we've all recognized it we've all we've all seen it we've all felt it we all feel the change in the atmosphere we feel the change in the air that this is not just the same word that we believe 15 years ago or 20 years ago but there's another dispensation on the earth today that we are coming under that anointing of i believe that we recognize as the bride of christ that we're no longer living in some in some old age gone by but we are living in the very cutting edge word of god not that we could get deeper to make it complicated but that is manifesting what promised it would manifest that's the age we're living in we're not living in an age where we wish we could and we might get there or we can believe unto what there is no unto that we can believe it's eternal what we're what we're facing right now is an eternal word we're not believing on just to to unto the just shall live by faith but we're believing unto a body change so this guy is literally the limit for us in his time i believe we're recognizing that we're feeling it we're we're feeling the charge of the hour the anointing that's in the air the the word that's just coming forth we recognizing what time we're living in in the scripture jesus would come down off the mountain after being tempted and he would go to the synagogue and he would have them open a book and he would identify exactly where they were at at that time in prophecy he flipped right to the part of the prophecy and he said right now we're walking in this scripture i believe we have the same sure word in our time that we can flip back in prophecy and say right now we are walking in this scripture and in this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your ears not somebody else's not another age not another time but it's being fulfilled in your ears we have a perfect prophetic word to a perfect prophetic people in a perfect prophetic age we're recognizing where we are at in this time it's not another time where we wish we could or we might have enough faith but this is the finishing age we are not we're not building a wall anymore but we're turning corners faster than we can get the blocks up we're turning corners after corners after you know if you're building a pyramid it starts and it's a long wall for a while and then you turn and it gets a little shorter and the next time the walls look shorter but we're at the top of the pyramid we are turning corners in the word faster than men before us ever even thought that they could get to that part in the word and it's coming to us naturally because we're predestinated to do that work that's what we've been called for that's what we've been purposed for if we don't if not here but what are we doing here if we don't have a purpose but our purpose here is to fulfill the end time prophetic word so if we're to fulfill the end time prophetic word then we must manifest what that end time prophet preached to a people that is us walking in prophecy i know we're in agreement right but tonight we want to remove all doubt that i'm talking about you we want to remove all doubt that this message is the vindicated word of the hour we're not looking for something else or another resource or a voice but this is the final voice this is what we are walking under and we have a word in this hour to say why would god give us the final word if it was gonna have so much power in it that it would set the devil into the lake of fire i believe we have a more sure word in this tower than any age come before us because we're walking in prophecy there's been more prophecy about you as the end time people than any other people gone before you to think about it that that you would look there in the bible and think about those great and mighty warriors that were walking in their prophecy they they're walking in their time but you are walking in a greater word of prophecy there's been more prophesied about you as the second coming of christ in a body than there ever was before but we've got to recognize where are we living in what season are we under what age are we under i'm not under the age of a man now you can say that i'm in a pentecostal age but you got me missed we're in another age this is not a pentecostal age nor is it a lutheran age nor is it a wesleyan age we are living in a bright age fulfilling a bride's word to to a prophetic class of people not us then who if not you tonight then who else is going to fulfill it but you know as well as i do there's something inside of you that tells you that you are the one that is going to fulfill it i don't have to tell you that i don't have to identify you as that but you know within yourself that there's a greater purpose within you than you can express out of these lips that you can express out of this life there's a greater purpose that's already in you you know it's there it's what brought you here tonight it's what caused you brothers over there to start driving at one o'clock in the morning come over here there's something in you that pulls you to the promise of the hour this is what we live for we do not live to go to the fair we do not live to go on a vacation so we live to fulfill the promise of the hour because that is what god placed us here to do to walk in perfect promise but recognizing that it's now is the time this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears if you're looking for a a revival to come you better you better open your eyes because it's already come he's already here elijah must first come elijah has already come the revival has already come it's striking the earth it's striking hearts it's it's igniting faith of the people we should be the most encouraged people on the face of the earth yet the devil sometimes gets us so beaten backwards that we end up looking like the most gloomiest people on the face of the earth but if we recognize the day that we're living in is the fulfillment of all things all things what season are you living in where where do you think we're at under this under this tree you've got to recognize it for yourself brother bran would say the time is at hand now the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom economy of the mighty revelation of god could not come forth to thus we immediately learned principle sorry i'm not great with words but the revelation of god for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time look at the history of israel the revelation of god did moses come only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people cried unto god jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead in in this age the revelation of god will come in its due time it will not falter somebody say it will not falter due time neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today we have more prophecy backing us up then even when christ was here the first time walking in jews then even when he was here fulfilling those prophecies there's more prophecy about us in this age that christ is dwelling in us fulfilling that prophecy it's in due time it was not to happen 10 years ago even though we preached as hard as we could it was not to happen 10 years ago it was not to happen 30 years ago we're under another dispensation but now we are in the end time it will not be premature but it will come in its due time remember we say due time i believe we're in due time we've got to remove all hindrances all doubt that we are living in the rapture season this is not a time to be mellow or gloomy or pull back or retreat but we are living the time of going forward in the word of prophecy to take the land that's already been given to us a joshua generation fulfilling that which moses told him he would fulfill to walk forward in faith and take the land that was already given to him we're not walking a mess or taking something that's not ours but it has already told us it's yours go ahead and take it now if i if i threw this up here and i said that's yours you go ahead and take it whose fault is it that you don't have it sometimes we lack the faith to be able just to walk up here and grab this and say it's mine i take it but god's already given you everything that you have need of you just gotta walk forward in faith and say i take it i take it the reason why we have doubt circling in our camps is because people have not reached out enough in faith and taken what's already been given to them i'm not doubting whom i believed in i know who i met i didn't meet a man i didn't need a doctrine i didn't meet a pastor i met jesus christ the flesh how could i doubt who i met how could i doubt what i've received but i know i have a relationship with him though i fail him i still know though i fall away i still know though he slayed me i still know who i'm at we've got to remove all doubt out of our mind that this is the absolute truth of the hour we cannot let that demon linger any longer if i have one thing to fulfill in my life is to eradicate the demon of doubt circling in the message i don't know who you met but i met christ i don't know what season you're living under but i'm living under the season of a rapture the season of body change the season that there won't be a taste of death there won't be an experience of of a death or a pain crossing over but we'll be caught up i believe this i believe that i'll just get so caught up one day my body will get a little lighter i know we've experienced just glimpses of it here and there we get caught up for the anointing and the hours coming forth and the dispensation is getting greater we feel a little bit caught up one of these days it's going to be just like that you can then call me a pentecostal you can call me a radical you can call me fanatic but you're gonna call me bye you're gonna say hey where'd it go cause one of these days it's gonna ignite and we're gone we're not looking back all right but we've already been procrastinated to receive it in this hour i know how the devil works he'll come right there and talk to you and say yeah he's talking to the person right next to you that person right next to you they're going to go in the rapture but it's not for you we need to remove all doubt tonight we need to remove all that imagine what this meeting could be this weekend if we tonight removed all doubt that we are walking in the perfect order of god we are walking in perfect truth we got to remove the doubt we know we know the word yeah we've heard it some of our sunday school kids have heard more word than them bible scholars spent their entire lives pouring into the bible we've heard the word we've been predestinated to receive it we've been we have the resources predestinated in us for a body change every element it takes i don't know i'm not a doctor but daryl what might take to change your body but i know that you already have it in you i know that god already placed those elements within these people in this hour that can receive a body change it's predestinated you're not asking for something that's not yours but it's your time it's your season under the sun we are coming to maturity i believe the sun's up i believe we're walking under a harvest time sun we're not walking under a premature sun but this is the harvest time this is when the seed is known for the fruit that it is what fruit are you yeah you're somebody's fruit i believe we're the fruit at the top of the tree that right inspiration is the time that comes to life you know that that prophecy of isaiah had been laying there in the scripture all those years yeah 800 something years that prophecy had been laying writing that scripture but after he came off the mountain and he knew what time he was walking and he said right now is this scripture fulfilled in your ears it had been laying there waiting for the time to come when it would be manifested when he would walk in that prophecy he would say hey i'm walking in a prophecy that isaiah's talked about 800 and something years ago but you know we have more prophecy about us in this hour that we can go back through a prophetic word through a perfect vindicated prophet and recognized we are walking in the hour that he told us we were walking it's not coming it's here [Applause] but you've already been predestinated it's already in you yeah i think that's the biggest the biggest devil of out gets in there it says it's not for you it's for your neighbor turn your neighbor and say it's for me there you go that was not for your neighbor it's for you it's for me you gotta recognize you're walking under the light you can't rely on your pastor to walk into the light or your deacon or your or your preacher your favorite evangelist or your favorite televangelist or your favorite song leader you've got to recognize you're walking under the light yourself this is an individual affair to recognize i am walking under this perfect light recognizing your day and its message this day this scripture is fulfilled don't worry about whether you'll have it you'll have it he already put it in you don't worry about whether you'll be able to make it you'll make it he already put it in you you think about that woman that recognized christ in her hour and there she walks through the house of critics i believe as i believe you're gonna have to walk through the house of critics and she's dragging her condemnation in her weight with her and she's walking through simon's house but she's recognized christ is in that room she doesn't know what she's gonna do when she gets there all she knows is she's got to praise him she's got to fulfill brother brown said she knew she had a service to do for him but she had nothing to do it with you ever feel like that don't worry about it it'll be there when you get there now she approaches him and as she has her oil brother brown says god furnish the water and the towels don't worry about whether you have the faith it'll be there when you get there just don't doubt your source recognize your source is the perfect source not looking for something else just walk in face it'll be there when you get there she didn't know she had the water in the towel she didn't recognize it but at that moment she was walking in prophecy she was fulfilling what god had seen in his mind before the foundation of the world she was walking a perfect prophecy i believe that's us we may not feel like we have it but don't doubt where you're at in this season this is a time you can talk to an atheist agnostic you can talk to everyone they recognize this thing's coming to an end this cosmos is revolving to an end how much more we the bread of christ should know this thing is coming to an end not waiting for something don't wait for another another event to happen it could be the last event brother bam said but she went upon her inspiration she went on the inspiration of the hour what is our inspiration of the hour the message tells us that there are some standing here that shall not taste of death but shall be cut up raptured to me in the air why do we believe this if it doesn't fulfill what it says but i can testify to you that this message works this message works when it says it'll work it'll work when somebody is a good old hypocrite sitting on the pew don't come and change that life it'll work for a backward sinner or a out on the street it'll work in that life it'll work for a drunk or a secret sinner hiding in the church and work in that life the fruit of it testifies of what it is it works [Applause] it works look at this front row right here it works where'd you all come from it works the message works look at this front row over here where'd they come from it works and working a young man that recognizes this is the truth of the hour it works you have to try the message doesn't work for you just get under the leadership of the word of the hour it's not about whether you try it's about whether you recognize the authority you're placed under remove the doubt he's already done it just follow the leadership of the hour it works remember brother branham would talk about demon shakira being an oil man right and he wanted to go find some oil and he asked brother branham he said yeah i had a vision there's the main oil well down there in kentucky right and he says well would you tell us right where it says no it's not for commercial use yeah and then immediately brother bran goes into motive and objective you see you might start a church or you might start a moon you might start a following unto yourself but your motive injective has got to be correct and so they go out and and they go and search the soil they know around about where it's at right and they pack up all their all their stuff from i think he was based in albuquerque he packs about his gear and all his all his equipment he has a few partners and they get out there and they find oil right near where brother branham said notice he said right near where i said right and they begin to drill down and the first thing you know they strike oil they're going to pump it out oh we've got oil and then you get a little bit of money coming and then they begin to bicker amongst themselves and you find that their mode of injective weren't what they said it was it was to build their own kingdom so they didn't have the right objective to build the kingdom for god so god never blessed it but they got oil because they were right near where brother brennam said that oil was you see they got really close to the truth they got right up next to the truth and they drew that well and the first place they found water or oil they stopped and then they denominated and then they built a kingdom unto themselves and then see they had a little bit of life in there it was the real genuine oil that was coming up but it wasn't the main source it was the sublet it was it was a tributary off of that main source then we could drill down and begin to drill wells over here and over there and you know what after a while those wells begin to dry up how many times have we seen that a man get a little gift in his life he started working unto himself and then a little give it up just to give it a little while and that oil will begin to dry up because he's not tapped into the main source he's not tapped into that fountain that keeps flowing he's stepped into his own source and god knew it was going to happen so he allowed him to tap into part of that life but you see how the main source begins to pop those little tributaries begin to withdraw those arms or branches as it were begin to withdraw the oil that they have in them and the only place that you will find oil in those times is the main vein of where that oil is but the ramp says they went out there and they drilled themselves holes and they had holes on for the driver you're a oil worker you know you could drill a hole and also it ends up dry one day it's done cap it it's over millions lost millions lost bankrupt forsaken look at brother branham let us over here see how the devil works brother branham never let him there he said there's the main source there but they didn't follow it through they got real close and then when their oil well dried up they wanted to blame it on the prophet and say hey our oil well dried up you must be a false prophet brother brown says so the prophecy could remain true not more than a hundred yards from where they dug their first hole they found the main source that's never run dry to this day the main source of that oil you see when you recognize the main inspiration of this word is not a man it's not it's not a whim it's not a false wind it's the voice to god in our hour it's the main source i believe we tapped into it i believe we've tapped into that main source i believe that's where the oil for the wise virgin is coming from she's tapped into another source she doesn't have to go out and get it brother brown says it pumped eleven hundred barrels uh a a half day eleven hundred barrels of oil in half day showing that if you come in here tonight and your center off the street you're going to get the same pain as i get that i've been serving the lord for 20 years because it's vindication of where we're at in this time this is the end time hour i believe we're speaking to some 11th hour workers it could be your your prodigal it could be somebody you work with but we're speaking to 11th hour work 11 hour workers in this hour they'll get the same pay thank god brother random calls them little pawns little denominational ponds you see where man has stopped at the first place they found life just like lot did stop at the first place that looks good to you but that's not the main source we got to recognize we're tapped into the real thing we're tapped into the real source if we've somehow caught up dry we've got to look back at this and say we've got to tap in again we got to get back to that main source [Applause] we've got to recognize where we're at the bible says blow out the logs of tradition he said bore holes in the ground dig them out set dynamite blow down keep blowing the shafts go down till we found till we find the main vein now that's what we call prospecting and tonight we're trying to take the word of god and use it by the power of the holy spirit to blow all the indifference and doubts away from us all those little light fluffy things that just doesn't have any foundation doesn't have any weight in our life we want to blow it all away so we can find this glorious vein that vein is christ you'll find that if you actually take the word to the devil all those things that you find as mountains in your life are actually just little light fluffy things to think that a little light fluffy thing would keep you from your ultimate victory would keep you from your healing but keep you from your deliverance if you just apply the word to it you'll find out that little light fluffy thing it can't stand in the presence of this word god bless you brother mitch good to see you amen finding the new friends and old friends but we're finding that we are we are promised to receive it it's ours to have it's just as easy if i said hey this is yours come and take it this is yours that healing you're looking for it's already yours right that was the first sign remember moses was given two signs he said how will you how will they believe me they know i'm just a man how will they believe that i've met the i am he said i'll give you two signs so that israel might know that you met me he didn't care about the critics he knew the critics were going to doubt him but the two signs were to prove to israel that they me that he met him but i believe we're living under another son i believe we're living under another dispensation where joshua was already given the commandments of how to take the land don't let the words of moses depart from your mouth if you say don't let the words apart from your mouth if you say and joshua finds the inspiration on the hour to take the lamp and we look at joshua in the scripture figure what a courageous man if we are not equally as brave as joshua we will never make this rapture we've got to have the faith of joshua to recognize that's my land that's my promise that's right belong i'm going to take it you see there's a big difference between a real believer and a make-believer they'll get right up to the line and that maybe believer will see giants you'll just see lots of giants over there that land but to a joshua or a caleb all i see is grapes all i see is promises all i see is vindication as i see is my family saved all i see is being filled with the holy ghost all i see is walking in victory they don't take the time to stop and look at the giants he already knew the giants were subject unto him you just walk in the land and i'll bless you see the problem is we try to walk in the land without having the fullness of the holy ghost is that right and then the devil mixes us up and then we we run back with our tail between our legs you've got to be in the land israel was never blessed till they were in their land and let me say you'll never be blessed until you make a full surrender and come under the anointing of this word and the work is done for you then it's not about how much you can crawl or wiggle or carry across you've already come subject under the word and the word is what has the power within it remember the badge that man couldn't stop a truck for that badge could because the authority was in the batch let me say the authority is in the message if we get sideways we wonder why we've got to get back to the real world we've got to get back to the pure word of god and recognize that's where the power lays it's not and if i think i can or some kind of psychological mind battle you've got to recognize the power is in the word that's what fixes problems i can't come sit down with you and talk you through a situation but by the power of the word it will fix the problem how many times have we witnessed it happen by the power of the word it fixes the problem every time don't worry it is for you you've been predestinated to receive this message in this age when it fell upon luther it manifested the promises of that hour when it fell upon wesley it manifested the promises of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it fell upon moses it manifested the promise of that hour fell upon noah manifest the promise of that hour when it fell upon jesus it manifest the promise of that hour see it's the holy spirit coming down to quicken make alive those people that's foreordained of god to be in the rapture has a fridge take that quote print it out put it on your fridge you're for ordained to receive a rapturing word in this hour if it weren't to ask these hour if it worked in luther's hour if it worked in jesus hour it will work today it's yours to have you're predestinated [Applause] to receive it in this hour notice that is if he's a true eagle you know how you know if you're a true eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle now it's not by how many power points we have it's not by how much we understand the greek or the diagonal or we take it back to the 8 67 strong's concordance but it's understanding this is the vindicated word of the hour there is no else i'm not looking for another source i'm not looking for another resource i'm not looking for a backup plan they're andrew i don't have a plan b if this message is wrong i'm lost i don't have a backup plan i don't have another source but i'm all in if this message is wrong i'm going to help but i'm all in in this message i'm not looking for anything else nothing else is i recognize in my ears but we must have the pure word if you're a true evil you'll recognize that we're not walking in another age we're walking in this age [Applause] it's for you you want another prophecy about it so therefore we know that luther could not get to it wesley and so forth the reformers knox finney calvin are down so forth they didn't get it all but what they had was the gospel truth amen but now somebody say now in the last days we are given the understanding by the word somebody say by the word that we are going to understand it we are given the understanding by the word that we will understand this message and when you recognize this message to be the truth it's not just a fielded quote it means you have potential for rapture it means you recognize you have a theophany there's elements inside you that will take a body change when you recognize this would be eagle food god doesn't throw theophanies out there for everybody to have but they're all numbered in his mind they're written on the last book of life and he recorded them already and if you come in touch with your theophany [Applause] you can't lose you can't be lost you can be defeated you can't be you can get down you can get gloomy but you cannot lose god's already got a place prepared he didn't just prepare it for anybody to come but you alone cannot lose well we've got to remove the doubt that it's for somebody else or for another time or maybe this message is the truth but it's just not for me we've got to get rid of that devil we know it this harmony is to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it somebody say never doubts it therefore nothing nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary what did mary say when the word came to her when the word came knocking at her door be it unto me according to thy word not according to what what some so-and-so says or dr dobson says or my old pastor says be it unto me according to thy word i receive it i take it joshua came back and he said here's some grapes why don't you taste the seed why don't you eat a book why don't you have a taste of it recognize this is the gospel truth in this hour there is none other [Applause] this is it friends we're not looking for anything else this is it this is the fullness of all things it's in this word how come now in 2022 we're just getting to these revolutions it's this time man in the 70s read this message just as much as i'm reading it today it wasn't time but now this day this scripture is fulfilled the bride has the mind christ for she knows what he wants done with the word and she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water that comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise what a consolation friends the bride only does his will and no one can make you do otherwise they have the sith the lord or the keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word god in them doing the works brother daryl if you took account of how many healings you've seen in your ministry you run out of paper it'd be too many to count come on it's god in them doing the works just in this year i've seen more miracles in my own walk than i have in my whole walk put together it's god in them doing the works it's god in her doing the quick short work she knows what he wants done with word she's gonna do something with it now you sat in here service after service listen to tape after tape you know the message in and out you probably have said oh you misquoted that or he didn't read that correctly or there's a period after that you know what you know the word but it's time to perform it it's not just time to quote it but feel good about it it's time to perform the word in which we've labored so hard to keep under with we've made sacrifices after sacrifice and we've labored to be in this building tonight i know that you sacrifice to be where you're at but for what purpose to perform the word to perform the next chapter of acts they know that it has to be god of them doing the work fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he in his earthly ministry so now somebody's saying now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now somebody say now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time god didn't misplace you god put you in the wrong age god didn't place you in a just a random time out of just there you were but god specifically placed you for this specific time to fulfill a specific word in this hour i said three specifics without messing up [Applause] you know there's something more than you you know there's greater purpose in your life you know that something's pulling you drawing you yeah you know that until you came into the contact with this word you were helpless you're a wretch looking for something and now we've come under the leadership of this word and it's given us a promise that there is another purpose to fulfill there's a finishing capstone age there's there's a finishing to this word that's what's pulling us that's what's drawing us but when the anointing has come in many fail to recognize what that anointing is bringing we're going to be sitting through here is everybody that could be here all weekend raise your hand you can be here all weekend you're going to no doubt feel the anointing of god come into this room it's going to circle past here it's going to go row by row it's going to come up it's going to go down it's going to go up there in the sound booth and it's going to come down it's going to be radiating right around this word right here when that anointing comes into this room do not miss it do not miss it and put it off for another time do not miss it you might not get next year's pawnee meetings you might not get next sunday you might not get next wedding when that anointing comes into this room do not miss it we've got to be so desperate to get where we need to be do not miss it when it comes in do not miss it when you feel the wave of god recognize you're walking in that time a friend of mine just came from us from so-called messenger church to our camp meetings he said wow he said i've never seen anything like this he said it was like we were living in brother branham's days he said this is exactly what i imagined it would be like and i kind of took a step back i said how shame on me yeah shame on me for not recognizing when that anointing comes in that room it's the same angel it's the same anointing it's the same power and many of us would say oh we could just have a conference with brother branham but the angel is the one that told brother brandon what to say and that same angel has come into our church time after time after time and we fail to recognize the presence of god in our hour this message will draw the angel into our presence this message that's preached about this pulpit we'll draw the angel of the lord to this building he accompanies his message it's the same anointing we're not looking to live back in brother branham's days i don't want to live in brother branagh's days i'm living in the days of the message of the voice it's about to be finished we're living in that hour we got to recognize when that adolescent comes in jacob knew there was an israel inside him the whole time jacob knew there's more to me i'm not just going to dive supplanted there's another me inside here when that anointing came in he didn't let it go he said i've got to have a change i've got to have a name change that anointing is what changes our name we'll never receive it the same thing happened for john when he came under that anointing on the isle of patmos caught up under that anointing he said i know there's more to john than just this then just describe they're just writing these things and being a loving kind person and a good christian there's more to john than that but when that anointing came through he said i'll not let you go till you bless me i'll not let you go until you reveal my name on the book i'll not let you go we gotta have the same [Music] that anointing that's going to come through we're not preaching spiritualism he's here for a purpose he doesn't come in the door if he's not here to fulfill a purpose and how many times have we let him sit with it with dirty feet back in the corner i hope we didn't come into these meetings this week thinking oh it's just going to be it's going to be better than last year better than the year before this is the meeting i don't know what you have need of in your heart but this is the meeting that it comes to pass you've got to remove all doubt you've got to take all doubt out of your life and say this is my time this is my anointing i will not let it go until i get my blessing i will not let it escape me until i get my blessing you'll find a pile of bones here until i get my bestie i've got another name there's another me it must be revealed this is the meeting this is the hour for it don't wait for another time recognize where you're walking in recognize the hour in which we're stepping into right now this is not just another age this is the age this is not just another word this is the word walking in prophecy recognizing your day there's another you in there israel's in there somewhere it took all night to wore it out but israel was in there the whole time he had to labor under that anointing he had to physically restrain himself under that anointing to receive his blessing and yet we can't take a little bit of the word we've had more vindications than any church gone before us we've seen the vindication of this word how many times did brother venom say the light struck the lens remember he's talking about the picture the light struck the lens i believe the light struck the lens hey pawnee oklahoma i believe we've recognized there's a there's another being in the room the light has struck the land the lens only reflects an image of what it sees the light has struck the lands in this building however the light struck the lands in your life you recognize that you're living under a greater power than the power of this age listen for the change remember the great symphony you gotta listen for your part you gotta listen for that anointing to come through don't get stuck don't get stuck in the wrong age you're so busy battling that we're not pentecostal you're going to get stuck in the lutheran age you're so busy battling that it's all about emotion you're going to get stuck in the pecostal age don't don't miss the change of the anointing but what dick takes what dictated though that it was wesley's age did you brothers know what what made wesley's age what was the way west these people acted right what made it luther's age was the way luther's people acted what made it pentecost sage it was the way they acted so what makes this the bride age tell me who some stuffed shirt is to come in here and tell me how i can act when my word is preached tell me how to act when my my age is being lived out this is my age i am part of the bride i am the one who dictates what a bright age looks like i'm the one who dictates whether it's too emotional or whether it's too charismatic or whether it's too dry i'm the one that dictates because i am the bride this is my age we set the pattern the bright age is created by us we are not messing up don't worry you're not getting too far out of the limb you are the bride you are the one setting the pattern for the age this is your age are you the bride is this the bright age it's your age you're the one setting the pattern for it if you want to clap clap you might shall shout you want to dance dance it's your age don't let some psychologist come in here and tell you how to act he's never even been in that age either the psychology age we are the bride age the fullness of the word don't tell me how to act the word will tell me how to act that anointing will tell me how to act we are setting the pattern nobody's never walked here before nobody's ever stood where you stood before but listen for the change there's been symphonies and symphonies he says but there's a symphony of god's word and the whole drama changes you are who are interested how many is interested listen for that change you know it's getting close you hear the way the drums are beating amen want something to happen you know this is a change see it's going to break out into a burst in a few minutes see and you're watching for it you can tell the way the drums are timing oh god if you can hear the drums of the finish now if you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly words seeing itself out and it shall come to pass in the last days the symphony of god's great drama that he's playing it changes him his symphony at the junction the composer and those who are interested listen for the change they listen for the change in the book of luke i don't know how long we've been i'll try to cut some of this out it's a meeting right everybody okay book of luke 19 and when he was come nigh even now with the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from among the multitudes said unto him master rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said to them i tell you that if these could should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out and when he was come near he beheld the city and went over saying if thou hatch known even now at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee encompass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in the one stone upon another because thou knew was not the time of thy visitation [Music] those are strong words and what provoked those words the pharisees trying to say that the disciples of jesus didn't have the right to rejoice let me just deal with this devil of doubt for a minute all right we're going to remove all doubt no doubt many of us have been to camps and many of the youths sing here they've been to kemp after camp you felt the anointing of god and you've danced and you've cried and you and you prayed and you felt that rejoice anointing and then what happens that old pharisee spirit gets back on you and says hey you're out of order were out of line you ought not to act like that you know that wasn't a real victory that was just emotion or that was just harismore that was that that was the emotion of the preacher got you caught up you ought not to act like that how jesus handled that devil of doubt to say you'll never live your seed will never live there will be no blessing done unto you because you have tried to quiet the praise of god's people you know why the pharisees were upset that jesus disciples were rejoicing we find in matthew 9 then came to him disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not and jesus said unto them can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then they shall fast no man putteth a piece of new cloth into an old garment for that which is put in it into fill it up take it from the garment and the rent is made worse neither do men put new wine in old bottles the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved that old spirit's still here brother manuel your church not not to rejoice like it's rejoicing how come they're not fasting praying like us over here brother wendell why is your church always on top of the world why are they always shouting that'll be fasting and praying all right that's what the disciples of john were saying how come you're not fasting and praying like we are are you not taking this serious are you not sincere enough all right come on remember brother branham was a in the herald of his coming you say i can't read it anymore all's they put in there it's fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray and you know why they do that he said because they have failed to recognize the awakening of the bride this is not a time to fast and pray friends i don't mean that if you have need or you can go fast and pray that's not a time to fast and pray in the church and to try to keep the praise of god's people quiet how can the bride keep quiet when she is with the bridegroom how can she hold back her praise which she knows she's been awakened she's come under a new handship a new authority this is her season to cry out [Applause] you're not going to change the way you praise brother colby how you praise the mirror is how you're going to praise him over there when you get over there you're going to be exactly like you are here do not hold back these stones will immediately cry out if she holds back her praise friends i don't want to be guilty of holding back praise to my god i don't know what he's done for you but if i can tell you what he's done for me i don't want to be guilty of holding back my praise from my god he's done so much for me i cannot tell at all i cannot tell at all he has washed all of my sins away we don't want to get to the finish line and realize he had a little bit more praise left inside us that i had a little bit more voice left to give brother andrew we want to give everything that we are he's done so much for us how can the bride keep quiet when she is walking with the bridegroom [Music] he's my hero he's done everything i exalt him i lift him i praise him i worship him he's my bridegroom that same pharisee devil is upon the church to try to keep your pace quiet ain't no god-called ministry ever tried to keep the church quiet i've never seen a wildfire in my life we were put here for one purpose and one purpose only let everything that hath breath praise ye the lord praise he the lord over here praise you the lord over here praise you the lord praise you the lord i'm not working you up i'm trying to tell you what hour you're living in destroy the demon of doubt been moving that's a giant that come into the church in the last day i say we cut his head off i say we let the praises ring in this hour i say god's worthy of it it's not how loud i am or how powerful i sing he's worthy of it [Applause] recognize the anointing that's coming to our midst this is not just some age not some word it's the greatest thing that has ever struck the face of the earth and you are privileged to be predestinated to receive it and to think that a baptist can shout louder than you he doesn't even know how many gods there is but you've been predestinated to receive a vindicated word in this age ain't no rock going to steal my praise now well i've got breath in my lungs not while i've got praise left again sister lily ain't nobody gonna steal my song not while i've got breath in my lungs not as i'm a lot longer i'm allowed to testify i'm going to praise his name we've got to recognize where we're walking to think that we're coming under that third sign it's here remember brother brown said there's been a change in my ministry did you hear the change in the octave we've stepped into another octave we're not walking in the octave of another age we're walking in the right octave we've stepped a little bit higher we're now receiving something higher than they had back there hit another spirit real quick in the seven sea message brother man will say you just live a good christian life you don't need to understand all this you just leave it you live a good life this isn't for you and men today are still preaching the same thing hey you just live a good christian life you just you just you know you you play that tape once a week you just push play when i say and you'll make it because that's not for you to understand anyway you know why the devil wants to keep the revelation of the seventh seal out of the church there's a people that it's for i've been given to understand that there will be an understanding in this age at the end time somebody will understand the words that i prophesied about somebody will take this word and they will manifest the very prophecy of what i'm preaching to you now 1963 church this is not for you but it's for another church there's another people that are going to fulfill the things that i'm speaking to you now don't let that demon of doubt come in here and try to steal you away from the victory the seven seal is not a scarecrow [Applause] that's why the devil's trying to keep the holy ghost out of nothing gets me more upset then some preacher so-called trying to keep the holy ghost out of the church [Music] if you only knew me before i had the holy ghost nothing gets me more upset yeah is that wrong to be upset yeah i mean it makes me mad it reboils my blood trying to take the holy ghost away from the only thing that will save these young people trying to take the power of the holy oak side of the church that is the only thing that will set the captive free it's the only thing that will redeem the lost is the only thing that give liberty to them that are bruised it is the only thing that gives us peace i wonder why anxiety is an all-time high depression moving to the church of god because men have taught the power of the holy ghost out of the pulpit not on my watch i will preach the holy ghost until i run out of breath i will preach the holy ghost until i fall over and die it is the very life source without the dynamics you will never receive the mechanics you will never know what it meant you must have the dynamics working in the church we've got to remove all doubt that we are walking in the perfect light of god no question is this right is this wrong devil's got us so confused sometimes we don't know which way we're coming or going you say cut his head off i say we got to have the same faith as joshua when he crossed over into that land he was so sure that today was the day that this scripture was fulfilled he needed just a little bit more time moses had two signs joshua walking under another sign he needed just a little bit more sunlight he said son stand still now you think what if i said that i think this guy's lost his rocker but those men were so aware of what anointing that they were walking under they knew the power they saw the captain of the lord of the host going before him they knew that there was no way that they could fight that fight they recognized the anointing that they were under and when joshua spoke those words they said come on boys we got some more time to fight come on god's given us a little more grace in this power to win some more souls god's given us the more grace to bring that prodigal back in son stay still [Applause] it's a paradox right for the sun to stand still never happened who is joshua think that he can command the creation of god to stand still they were so sure that today with the day he said lord i need a little bit of help and god caused flaming stones of fire to fall from the sky and destroy giants from among them you tell me when that ever happened before those stones are created for one purpose and one purpose only to kill giants god created those stones to say giants right so then later we pick up we pick up david and walk in the same valley right he's in need of some stones and there he finds five stones right in the same valley where joshua called for stones from heaven dave's walking along that stone looks just a little bit special huh putting that in my this stone's created to kill a giant you think we're just we're just reading this message for fun because it makes us excited i think i'll put that quote in my script bag it was created to kill giants that quote was made to kill a giant that inspiration was designed to kill a giant and david's one of them stones and put in his sling but abram says those stones are confessions those great stones that fell from heaven are confessions what's in your mouth i think i'll take this quote right here i'm putting my script back i think i'll take this great stone right here i'll put in my mouth maybe i'll have a leather sling but i got a mouth out of the confession of my mouth these great stones that we've been preaching to you they're going to come forward over this pulpit these great stones don't let them just pass by but those stones were designed specifically to destroy giants those stones were created by the almighty and fell down to destroy giants and to think that we're letting giants walk around in our home to think that we're letting giants walk around in our life in in all night time our our fears and our failures to think they're letting a giant come down when we have a stone created for the purpose of destroying him the word is nigh even in thy mouth pick up a stone it's a paradox in the beginning of the message of paradox brother brandon would open a new bible right he would find a bookmark one of these silky things right he got a new bible and he says yeah i opened my new bible and the first one was on the first building of the temple and the second one was on the second building of the temple then my wife unknowingly had put a bookmark of a robin placed in there under mark 11 22. you might not mean much to you but it means a lot to me but ram said he struggled with that scripture his entire life until he came under that third sign he said i never understood if you say unto this mountain and be removed and do not doubt in your heart somebody say be removed i'm just ready for the doubt to be removed you know what's going to remove that doubt those mighty stones that we have in this word it's not going to come from emotion it's not going to come from a workup it's not going to come from tears or or crying or crawling it's going to come from a mighty stone that's already been placed within this world that you've been predestinated to receive at the right time under the right anointing under the right inspiration and at that time this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears [Applause] i i i i don't think that we should be struggling for anything in this life this message has given us power over every devil in hell it's given us power over anxiety it's given us power over depression he's given his power over lust it's given us power over conflict it's given us power over reasoning it's given us power over questioning it's given us power over doubt it's given us power over the wilds of the enemy this message has given us every stone that we need to slay every giant before us we're not waiting for it to come but it's here it's already here i'm just going to read that now we already have the stones the stones gods for ordained and we've got them all the way from ephesus to laodicea we're only waiting for that headstone that the builders rejected waiting for his coming the capping stone he says those great stones are confessions mark 11 and jesus answereth and say unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's safe i think it's time that we put a list of things that need to be all removed all right how many services we got five after this you got five i don't think there should be a giant standing by the time we walk out these doors i think it's time to make a list and say be thou removed thou demon of doubt be thou removed that question if what for this really is the truth be now removed i would i would challenge you if you're struggling with doubt tonight i would challenge you to say god i want i want your message to become vindicated to me this weekend are you willing to make that challenge but you've got to apply something if he does i want your message to become a reality to me i want it to be just words on a page i want to see a living god i believe if you'll put that on your heart and say that demon of doubt be thou removed we won't see a giant in here by the time you get done andrew there won't be a giant standing these stones were created to set his people free i don't know what you need removed out of your life but the lord put this on my heart he said they've got to remove that demon of doubt it can't stand under that anointing the reason why you feel the pull to get out from underneath that anointing is because that spirit is trying to hold you back because underneath that fountain it has no hold on you the band would say i'll pray this off of you and under my anointing it'll leave but you've got to recognize you've got to recognize what i preach to you is the absolute truth friends i can testify that if you stand for this word it'll stand for you it'll stand for you every time now right brother daryl if you stand for this word it'll stand for you mr april if you stand for this word it'll stand for you it works friends i say this week and we slay some giants i say this weekend we take some id stones we put them in the in the confession of our mouths and we let them go the word is not the even in thy mouth the music players would come sorry for the time make your confession known i'm not ashamed i'm not ashamed to confess that this is the vindicated truth in this hour i'm not ashamed to say that a kentucky hillbillion was used to bring forth the unadulterated word of god i'm not ashamed to say that i do not follow him as a god i do not baptize his name i i don't fall under that i don't just come under there and push play it's really easy to push play because i don't have to apply my name next to that but i want to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the prophet who preached the word i'm not ashamed of that i say it's time to let that stone go it's not a shame to say that this is what i believe in this is where i'm founded this is what i trust in this is my everything jonathan what will we do without this word it's the only thing that sets us apart [Music] to think that the devil's trying to attack our ministry saying you're being too harsh you're being too bold and yet he's coming to your house and he's taking your children he's taking your freedom he's taking your liberty and yet a man of god will stand here in position and you'll say you're being too strong [Music] you know that's the truth you feel the vindication of it in this room [Music] to think that a man of god would labor to stay under the anointing to say things that he would never want to say to say to bring direction to people that he loves to to people that he's prayed for he's cried out for and then we get the attitude that you're being too hard on me [Music] but yeah we'll let the devil just run right over us we'll let them tell us the message isn't real the message is false you're just following a man you need to go in here and listen to so and so and follow this website link or watch this youtube video and we'll let the devil ride in our own house [Music] and steal victories away from us more than that daddy's we'll let the devil come in our house and steal victories right out of our kids it's time for men to stand in this hour i say it's time for real sons and daughters of god to stand in this hour i am not ashamed of this truth i'm not ashamed of this gospel i'm not ashamed of this message i'll stand for it and it will stand for me [Applause] [Music] you said that when we ask we will receive we take you at your words lord we're asking you people will do greater things we believe it we believe we will
