[52:48] this morning amen let's look here in
[52:50] Mark 16 and
[52:53] 14 afterward he appeared unto the
[52:57] 11 as they sat at meat and up braided
[53:02] them
[53:03] uh and up braided them with their
[53:06] unbelief and Hardness of Heart because
[53:09] they believed not them that had seen him
[53:11] after he he was risen and he said unto
[53:14] them go ye into all the world and preach
[53:18] the gospel to Every Creature he that
[53:21] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[53:23] he that believeth not shall be damned
[53:26] and these signs shall follow them that
[53:28] believe in my name they shall cast out
[53:30] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[53:33] they shall take up serpents and if they
[53:35] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[53:38] them and they shall lay hands on the
[53:41] sick and they shall recover so then
[53:43] after the Lord spoken unto them he was
[53:46] received up into heaven and set on the
[53:50] right hand of God and they went forth
[53:52] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[53:54] with with them confirming the word with
[53:57] signs following amen I'd also like to
[54:01] read here in the book of second Timothy
[54:03] the 4th
[54:05] chapter amen and we'll start at the
[54:08] first verse
[54:11] here praise the Lord amen I I think fall
[54:15] Time Is Here praise the lord it's
[54:18] getting getting chilly out there uh 2
[54:22] Timothy 4 And1 I charge thee therefore
[54:25] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[54:28] shall judge the quick and the dead at
[54:31] his appearing and his kingdom preach the
[54:35] word be instant in season out of season
[54:39] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[54:43] longsuffering and Doctrine for the time
[54:45] will come when they will not endure
[54:48] sound Doctrine but will Heap uh after
[54:50] their own lust or but after their own
[54:52] lust shall they Heap to themselves
[54:54] teachers having itching ears and they
[54:56] shall turn away their ears from the
[54:59] truth and shall be turned unto fables
[55:03] amen God bless the reading of his word
[55:05] you can be seated here this
[55:08] morning I want to minister
[55:11] for a little bit here this morning uh on
[55:14] a on a simple subject it am man the god
[55:18] called
[55:20] preacher and um amen we are thankful for
[55:26] men of God and um we we talked here uh a
[55:32] week or so ago on the doctrine of
[55:34] unbelief and and and how that the Satan
[55:40] is is very uh he's very Sly and he's
[55:44] he's very uh his his ways the Antichrist
[55:49] is amen is anti- word and he comes in
[55:54] the in the simp simplest of forms to to
[55:57] take us uh away from what God's word
[56:01] says and so we want to always line
[56:05] everything up line our belief system up
[56:08] with the word of God in in all that we
[56:10] do now the prophet had taught us that
[56:13] the amen that the Antichrist Spirit was
[56:16] so subtle it he says it started with
[56:19] some some Deeds just amen some some
[56:23] things that were little contrary to the
[56:25] word they had left their first love in
[56:27] that in that first age and amen and and
[56:31] and then it become a saying and then
[56:35] before you know it when you got to the
[56:37] Third Church age it had it had become a
[56:40] Doctrine amen and it wasn't a Doctrine
[56:43] according to the word of God it was
[56:45] something that was totally contrary to
[56:48] the word of God and yet these men were
[56:51] preaching it as as if it was was the
[56:55] Gospel truth and they were amen bringing
[56:58] it bringing it in but that doesn't
[57:00] change the fact that that God has has
[57:04] got a plan and his plan to Amen to to
[57:09] for people to be saved is is through uh
[57:13] the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus
[57:15] Christ amen preaching is the
[57:18] proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus it
[57:21] is to show or to introduce the living
[57:26] Christ to the world Amen a a a preacher
[57:30] is to to prove that Christ is indeed
[57:35] alive amen and that the Gospel of Jesus
[57:39] Christ is not just some figment of man's
[57:43] imagination but it is the very power of
[57:46] God un salvation amen and so we we can
[57:52] see as we as we uh uh as we read here
[57:58] that that he was saying I I want you to
[58:01] go and I I want you to to Proclaim this
[58:05] good news I want you to Proclaim it with
[58:08] authority I will be there with you you
[58:11] lay your hands upon the sick and they
[58:13] shall recover amen you'll cast out
[58:17] Devils I will be in you bringing my
[58:22] words to to to reality to the people can
[58:26] you say amen I I I want to I I want to
[58:29] say to every every preacher in the
[58:31] building here this morning amen every
[58:35] preacher there is a great
[58:37] responsibility that is upon us as
[58:40] Ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[58:43] amen you've got to be divinely called
[58:45] you've got to be divinely trained and
[58:48] you've got to be divinely inspired of
[58:50] God Amen sometimes you know as the
[58:54] congregation
[58:55] we the congregation doesn't really amen
[58:58] know the process or many times don't
[59:01] understand what what is involved in in
[59:05] in being a preacher because the the
[59:07] preacher is living in two different
[59:09] worlds he's amen he's got to provide for
[59:12] his family he's got to go to work many
[59:15] of times he's got to amen uh uh uh love
[59:18] his children and raise them up and amen
[59:22] but yet there is a call upon on his life
[59:25] there's a there's a a a deep cry for
[59:29] Souls there's there's there's a a deep
[59:32] cry in the heart of a man of God that
[59:35] that wants to see the reality of the
[59:39] supernatural alive among the Bride of
[59:43] Jesus Christ amen he's not just one that
[59:46] is that that that is settled for just
[59:48] amen coming up and preaching
[59:50] occasionally behind the pulpit but he is
[59:52] ordained of God he is inspired tired of
[59:55] God to to to get this message to the
[59:59] people and he and he knows he's got to
[1:00:01] get it right he knows he's got to preach
[1:00:04] it exactly the way brother Brandon
[1:00:05] preached it in the spirit that brother
[1:00:07] Brandon preached it or he will have to
[1:00:10] give an account on that very day can you
[1:00:13] say amen amen so there is a
[1:00:15] responsibility that is that that lays
[1:00:18] within the bosom and The Souls of of the
[1:00:21] preacher amen I will say many times the
[1:00:25] that Satan will try to to kill the
[1:00:28] vessel even from very at at an early age
[1:00:31] or even from birth amen Satan will try
[1:00:35] to destroy that man and that that you
[1:00:38] you'll notice as amen H there there
[1:00:41] there there are uh uh Satan's got his
[1:00:44] got got his got his gun zeroed in on him
[1:00:48] because he's got a call from God Amen
[1:00:51] and God will even allow the devil to
[1:00:54] take that man to the last of his ability
[1:00:58] amen but brother Brandon would tell us
[1:01:00] but it's all in the training amen it's
[1:01:03] all in the training he says we cannot
[1:01:05] have Revival until we get men God called
[1:01:07] men God trained men that's that's not
[1:01:10] trained in the schools of Theology and
[1:01:13] of education but rugged men of faith
[1:01:15] that God has brought up in the school of
[1:01:17] his rugged training men who are not
[1:01:20] afraid to face the fire men who has come
[1:01:22] in the presence of God and know knows
[1:01:24] his power and knows his omnipotence and
[1:01:27] knows his healing power some men that
[1:01:30] has been trained to know the Living God
[1:01:33] somebody say know the Living God it's
[1:01:36] all right to train them by the word but
[1:01:38] the letter kth the spirit gives life and
[1:01:42] before we can have a Revival uh this
[1:01:44] revival God has to call out and and
[1:01:47] train men God trained men to carry this
[1:01:50] message and they don't care what the
[1:01:52] opposition is they are willing to go to
[1:01:55] the fiery furnace and defeat or in the
[1:01:57] Lion's Den or wherever it may be they're
[1:02:00] ready to go because they've been in the
[1:02:02] presence of God and they know he is
[1:02:05] whether it's the victory or defeat they
[1:02:08] stand still they still stand the same
[1:02:11] that's the kind of training God does to
[1:02:15] men it's very strange to think that God
[1:02:18] would do that that God would train his
[1:02:20] men like that but he does and you know
[1:02:23] we have an old song We sing some through
[1:02:25] the waters some through the flood some
[1:02:27] through deep trials but all through the
[1:02:29] blood God leads his people through great
[1:02:32] trials to purge them and sometimes it
[1:02:36] takes years to do it as for myself I
[1:02:39] believe God right now is training such
[1:02:42] men to meet the front line men are going
[1:02:44] to go through and shaken from their feet
[1:02:47] and sometimes it looks like the whole
[1:02:50] thing is Fallen but yet in the midst of
[1:02:52] it all they know that Living God and
[1:02:56] keep their face forward and keep moving
[1:02:59] on can you say amen amen so as we as we
[1:03:03] have just uh uh looked here it's more

[1:03:45] soul to dig into that message amen and

[1:05:49] he's not just listening to a tape for a
[1:05:51] sermon a preacher amen is taking amen
[1:05:55] his call that responsibility seriously
[1:05:59] as he goes in before the Lord amen in
[1:06:03] that Sweet Hour of Prayer Oh Glory to
[1:06:06] God Amen a preacher is called to deliver
[1:06:09] and to set the captives free through the
[1:06:12] anointed preaching of the word the

[1:06:19] simply explainers we got too many
[1:06:21] preachers that are explainers we got too
[1:06:23] many preachers that are amen that are
[1:06:25] Educators amen but that is not according
[1:06:28] to the Holy Ghost plan God's not sent
[1:06:31] the preacher to educate you amen he has
[1:06:34] anointed the preacher to preach the
[1:06:37] gospel under the anointing of the holy
[1:06:40] spirit in this day that we're living in
[1:06:44] amen now a sermonette on a certain topic
[1:06:49] is not a preacher a few scriptures and a
[1:06:52] few quotes to parallel author is not a
[1:06:55] preacher we got to have a preacher amen
[1:07:00] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:03] you see dead sermons though using
[1:07:06] scriptures and quotes amen they kill but
[1:07:10] it's the quickening of the power of the
[1:07:13] holy spirit that gives life amen amen
[1:07:19] hallelujah so preachers we've got to
[1:07:23] preach the
[1:07:25] gospel Jesus was anointed to preach
[1:07:27] Jesus amen and it didn't just have some
[1:07:31] some nice but empty words coming from a
[1:07:33] good man Jesus was not amen a
[1:07:37] well-meaning man full of sympathy for
[1:07:39] his fellow men and and others felt good
[1:07:42] around him and amen and wanted to be
[1:07:45] around him no Jesus was the very word he
[1:07:49] was
[1:07:50] anointed of God to preach the gospel
[1:07:53] well go glory to God Amen Jesus knew
[1:07:56] what it was to swing that sword Jesus
[1:07:59] knew what it was to set captives free
[1:08:01] Jesus knew what it was Amen to heal the
[1:08:04] Blind and to and to raise the dead why
[1:08:07] he was anointed to preach the Gospel of
[1:08:10] Jesus Christ so let me put it this way
[1:08:12] Jesus was commissioned and Jesus was
[1:08:16] anointed to preach the gospel there in
[1:08:18] Luke 4:18 he says the spirit of the Lord
[1:08:22] is upon me because Heath anointed me to
[1:08:25] preach the gospel to the poor he had
[1:08:27] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:08:30] preach Deliverance amen that that means
[1:08:33] to announce the release amen of the
[1:08:37] captives and the recovering of sight to
[1:08:40] the Blind and to set at liberty or to
[1:08:43] set at H H free them that are bruised to
[1:08:47] preach or to proclaim the acceptable
[1:08:50] year of the Lord what can you say Amen
[1:08:53] amen what was this acceptable year of
[1:08:56] the Lord this was the Year of Jubilee
[1:08:58] when the captives amen were to go free
[1:09:02] it was the Proclamation that Satan's day
[1:09:05] is over and the power of the Eternal God
[1:09:10] that was on the earth Amen to bring
[1:09:13] Deliverance to God's people amen oh yes
[1:09:17] amen I I I want to tell you amen that
[1:09:20] God knows what he's doing God how many
[1:09:23] believes God still alive today how many
[1:09:25] believes the anointing is still on the
[1:09:27] Earth today and that the anointing can
[1:09:30] still set the captives
[1:09:34] free
[1:09:36] Hallelujah now I know there's a lot of
[1:09:42] Kneads I know there's a lot of
[1:09:45] Knuckleheads amen a lot of preachers
[1:09:47] that that are behind pull pits today
[1:09:49] that don't belong behind pull pits amen
[1:09:53] well praise the Lord amen and there
[1:09:55] ain't nothing that can help a person
[1:09:57] like a preacher and there ain't nothing
[1:09:59] that can destroy an individual like a
[1:10:01] preacher amen a preacher can can can can
[1:10:04] bring amen healing to you and help you
[1:10:08] and pray with you and preach the gospel
[1:10:10] to you and set you free and a preacher
[1:10:13] can also scar you amen and leave you for
[1:10:17] dead because he's he's he's a he's not a
[1:10:20] he he's under his own wisdom he's under
[1:10:23] his own theologies and well praise the
[1:10:25] Lord and there's been too many in the
[1:10:27] message of the hour amen that takes the
[1:10:30] word of God that has come so pristinely
[1:10:33] that has come so precisely that has come
[1:10:36] so anointed of God well let me tell you
[1:10:39] something friends there's never been a
[1:10:41] day like this day there's never been a
[1:10:44] time where Satan has been exposed like
[1:10:46] in this day but yet there are preachers
[1:10:49] amen that'll get up through their
[1:10:51] intellect and try to call carve out
[1:10:54] their own amen following and carve out
[1:10:57] their own ideology and they the
[1:11:01] people of God well yall might as well
[1:11:02] help me preach amen they the
[1:11:06] people of God but that does not do away
[1:11:09] with the fact that God's going to have a
[1:11:12] preacher and God's going to have an
[1:11:14] anointing and God's going to set the
[1:11:16] captives free and there's going to be
[1:11:19] somebody that makes that
[1:11:22] rapture
[1:11:24] amen now God so involved man in his
[1:11:29] eternal purpose of
[1:11:31] redemption that he will do nothing
[1:11:35] outside of the agency of man amen now
[1:11:41] Jesus was the lord of the Harvest but
[1:11:44] Jesus turned to his disciples and he
[1:11:47] says the Harvest is ripe and the
[1:11:49] laborers are
[1:11:50] few pray ye the Lord lord of the Harvest
[1:11:54] to send labors into his Harvest this
[1:11:57] brother bradam would say he's making
[1:11:59] himself with man so bound together that
[1:12:03] he works only through the agency of man
[1:12:06] he chose man to work for him he could
[1:12:08] have chose the son to preach the gospel
[1:12:11] he could have chose the winds or the
[1:12:13] trees the stars but he chose man veils
[1:12:17] himself inside hides himself from the
[1:12:21] unbeliever and reveals himself
[1:12:24] to whom he will can you say Amen what
[1:12:27] would Jesus say amen he says there in
[1:12:30] John 14 and 10 he says believest Thou
[1:12:34] that I not that I am in the father and
[1:12:36] the father in me and the words that I
[1:12:38] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[1:12:41] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[1:12:43] The Works believe me that I'm in the
[1:12:45] father and the father in me or else
[1:12:47] believe me for the very Works sake
[1:12:49] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:12:51] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:12:53] shall shall he do also and greater than
[1:12:56] these shall he do because I go to my
[1:12:58] father can you say amen amen but I are
[1:13:03] y'all following me here today God works
[1:13:06] through the agency of
[1:13:09] men man now just because God is working
[1:13:13] through the agency of men men does not
[1:13:15] mean that God is needing your mental
[1:13:18] Powers it doesn't mean that he is
[1:13:20] needing your intellect oh no he doesn't
[1:13:23] need you to sit at your computer and
[1:13:26] come up with quotes uh amen that are
[1:13:29] interesting amen he's not needing you to
[1:13:31] learn the Greek and the Hebrew what he
[1:13:34] is needing is somebody that is
[1:13:37] surrendered to the power of
[1:13:42] God oh praise the Lord amen Jesus didn't
[1:13:46] tell the apostles amen go up and set you
[1:13:49] know seminaries and and teach all about
[1:13:52] me and what I did and go to new cities
[1:13:55] and set up new chapters and get new
[1:13:58] disciples amen I'm going to leave but
[1:14:00] now amen I just want you to go and and
[1:14:03] and teach something that I have done in
[1:14:05] the past but you see Jesus was not going
[1:14:08] he's not interested in just something of
[1:14:11] the past he wanted the world to know
[1:14:14] that he is alive today that his words
[1:14:19] are true today that his power is real
[1:14:24] today well come on church amen it's not
[1:14:27] something a of a yesterday but it's a
[1:14:32] reality of God's word
[1:14:34] today
[1:14:36] amen now he done something wonderful he
[1:14:39] was raised from the dead and you would
[1:14:41] think in the natural that that man amen
[1:14:45] or that Jesus would look and say now I
[1:14:47] want you to to go out and tell it
[1:14:50] wherever you go and amen set up all of
[1:14:52] these chap and get me a following out

[1:15:02] want you to stay at Jerusalem until
[1:15:05] you've be endued with power from on high
[1:15:08] and then when you are that well can you

[1:23:52] has taught about a preacher is not an
[1:23:54] intellectual
[1:23:55] man standing behind a pull
[1:23:59] pit there is an
[1:24:01] anointing that is to follow the fivefold
[1:24:09] ministry because God works through that
[1:24:14] Ministry well praise the Lord amen now
[1:24:19] Hallelujah the apostles were told that
[1:24:21] the same Spirit who anointed Jesus would
[1:24:25] come upon
[1:24:26] them
[1:24:28] amen Jesus said they' know what the holy
[1:24:32] spirit is because it was with them now
[1:24:35] in the body of Jesus Christ and he told
[1:24:38] him that he would continue to work
[1:24:41] through
[1:24:42] them amen a a and when Christ was raised
[1:24:46] and ascended on high he says he's given
[1:24:50] the gifts unto men
[1:24:53] brother bradam says that was the
[1:24:54] apostolic commission and it will never
[1:24:58] cease until the last Soul comes
[1:25:01] in now Jesus would say if you're there
[1:25:03] in John 14 and 15 if you love me keep my
[1:25:07] Commandments I will pray the father and
[1:25:08] he will give you another comforter that
[1:25:11] he may abide with you forever even the
[1:25:13] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:25:16] receive because it sees him not neither
[1:25:20] knows him but you know him
[1:25:23] and he dwells with you and shall be in
[1:25:26] you I will not leave you comfortless I
[1:25:28] will come to you yet a little while and
[1:25:31] the world sees me no more but you see me
[1:25:34] because I live you shall live also at
[1:25:37] that day you shall know that I'm in the
[1:25:39] father ye in me and I in you can you say
[1:25:44] Amen now Jesus is letting them know that
[1:25:46] there's fixing to be a transfer he is
[1:25:48] going to be leaving but the Holy Spirit
[1:25:52] the same holy spirit that anointed Jesus
[1:25:55] would be upon the body of
[1:25:58] Believers amen Jesus plainly tells his
[1:26:01] disciples to wait in Jerusalem until
[1:26:04] they received their credentials from on
[1:26:07] high I don't want you preaching I don't
[1:26:10] want you witnessing I don't want you
[1:26:12] doing anything
[1:26:15] until until you are endued with power
[1:26:17] from on high and only then can you
[1:26:21] Proclaim this gospel Acts 1:8 he says
[1:26:25] but ye shall receive power after the
[1:26:28] Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:26:31] shall be
[1:26:33] Witnesses unto me how many Wants To Be A
[1:26:37] Witness of his
[1:26:39] resurrection amen telling stories of the
[1:26:43] past is not going to cut it
[1:26:45] friends talking about a Jesus of 2,000
[1:26:49] years ago is not going to cut it talking
[1:26:52] about our prophet's Ministry of 2,000
[1:26:55] years ago is not the intent that the God
[1:26:59] had for this last days God's got a
[1:27:02] powerful Church there is the holy spirit
[1:27:07] that is living today in his body here on
[1:27:11] the earth and the prophet of God says
[1:27:14] this would be the most powerful age a
[1:27:18] church of all ages this would become the
[1:27:21] most powerful people why because she's
[1:27:26] got her doctrines lined up she's got the
[1:27:30] life lined up she's got it lined up with
[1:27:34] thus sayeth the
[1:27:38] Lord if there's ever been a time amen
[1:27:41] for preachers to Stand Tall it should be
[1:27:44] today if there's ever been a time for a
[1:27:47] preacher Amen to be humble it should be
[1:27:49] in this day if there's ever been a time
[1:27:52] time for the people Amen to to expect
[1:27:55] the supernatural amen from the ministry
[1:27:58] it should be in this day because there

[1:35:16] the
[1:35:20] seals well that just blew him out of a
[1:35:23] job
[1:35:26] right but look at all the
[1:35:28] thousands who are so
[1:35:31] confused who cannot open the Bible and
[1:35:34] see anything that
[1:35:35] resembles and cannot open and listen to
[1:35:39] the message
[1:35:41] right on when you have got
[1:35:47] men that are
[1:35:50] explainers
[1:35:55] well praise the
[1:35:57] Lord but Jesus made it clear in
[1:35:59] everything that he done I don't want you
[1:36:00] doing this
[1:36:02] intellectually amen Jesus the word lived
[1:36:06] by the living father that's what Jesus
[1:36:08] himself
[1:36:10] said only by my word and spirit can you
[1:36:13] live Eat My Flesh and drink my
[1:36:16] blood eat my word and take my
[1:36:20] life
[1:36:23] why
[1:36:24] is why is there so many that have fallen
[1:36:28] away someone says you're doing a good
[1:36:30] job brother
[1:36:33] Wendell why has there been so much
[1:36:36] falling
[1:36:37] away from the world today where they're
[1:36:39] saying that in the Millennials there's
[1:36:40] like only 40% believes in
[1:36:43] Christianity
[1:36:45] okay because the word has been so
[1:36:49] intellectualized and explained Ed
[1:36:53] away why has there been so many leave
[1:36:57] the
[1:36:59] message is because the words have been
[1:37:03] explained away we've put our faith in a
[1:37:07] man and not given heed to his message
[1:37:12] that's
[1:37:13] right until kids believe salvation is
[1:37:17] just listening to a
[1:37:19] tape brother brandham said the
[1:37:22] kth but the spirit gives
[1:37:26] life my words are spirit and
[1:37:31] life but you can sit in a message church
[1:37:34] and not have the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:36] Ghost and you'll allow that Old Devil to
[1:37:39] come in and before you know it you're
[1:37:41] putting everything in I've talked I've
[1:37:42] talked with one of the the big
[1:37:45] preachers one of the last ones to leave
[1:37:47] the message that's cing causing all the
[1:37:49] Havoc around the world
[1:37:53] I sat right out here in the parking lot
[1:37:56] before there was a parking lot
[1:38:00] Hallelujah I said the problem is you
[1:38:03] have you have based your
[1:38:06] ministry amen his dad was there in the
[1:38:09] Tabernacle and he was raised in the
[1:38:10] Tabernacle and he was talking about amen
[1:38:13] and you know all of these stories every
[1:38:15] time you was with him amen it was
[1:38:18] constantly H H uh uh you know brother
[1:38:21] Ram's done this and this miracle and
[1:38:23] that one and this one and that one and
[1:38:24] that was fine to me amen but the
[1:38:27] Miracles wasn't what got me I was raised
[1:38:29] in Pentecost I seen some Miracles what
[1:38:32] got me was the word but he constantly
[1:38:35] tell well amen and and now he's over
[1:38:38] there and and and i' I'd preached with
[1:38:40] him a couple times I'd preached for him
[1:38:44] amen and I told him I said the problem
[1:38:48] is you've built your entire belief
[1:38:50] system
[1:38:52] on little
[1:38:54] stories little things that brother Bram
[1:38:56] done and and then when someone comes in
[1:38:59] and tells
[1:39:00] you well it didn't quite happen that way
[1:39:04] well and they start putting question
[1:39:06] marks in your
[1:39:07] mind then you're sitting there thinking
[1:39:10] huh huh I said you have built your
[1:39:14] entire
[1:39:16] Ministry
[1:39:17] around
[1:39:19] stories and then when when they come in
[1:39:22] and and try to shatter the thing on the
[1:39:24] bridge or the bear or
[1:39:27] whatever you're just
[1:39:32] like and I said if you don't if you
[1:39:34] don't need if you don't get the power of
[1:39:36] the Holy Ghost in your life brother
[1:39:37] you'll walk away from this thing and it
[1:39:39] wasn't three or four months later when
[1:39:40] he did walk away from that that's right
[1:39:43] yes sir he never had the Holy
[1:39:47] Ghost the Holy Ghost ain't going to take
[1:39:50] you to some God of yesterday it's going
[1:39:52] to take you of a God
[1:39:58] today you can you can you can bring all
[1:40:01] the proof you want to you can try to
[1:40:03] tell me that bridge thing didn't happen
[1:40:05] you can try to tell me that this bear
[1:40:07] thing or whatever you want to bring it
[1:40:09] don't matter to me I believe what he
[1:40:12] said I don't need you I don't need you
[1:40:16] to to to prove and you and I Hallelujah
[1:40:20] and I don't have to prove Pro to you
[1:40:21] anything I don't have to prove to you
[1:40:24] the bridge or I don't have to prove to
[1:40:25] you the amen this that what I've got is
[1:40:28] come from the Holy Spirit he has already
[1:40:31] proved it stay in the
[1:40:37] word but it's because men have put so
[1:40:42] much on a man that when they think that
[1:40:46] man has failed and I want to tell you
[1:40:48] brother Bram was faulty just like you
[1:40:52] but that message
[1:40:55] on brother brandom had to repent just
[1:40:57] like you but that
[1:41:00] message brother brandom had come on
[1:41:07] church now we
[1:41:12] want what what has caused these
[1:41:15] thousands to
[1:41:16] leave what has
[1:41:18] caused is because they
[1:41:23] Hallelujah is because the
[1:41:26] message a good portion of the message
[1:41:28] folks as I'll put it off on a dead man
[1:41:30] of
[1:41:35] yesterday and there's no reality of the
[1:41:37] holy spirit in their lives
[1:41:40] today I want to
[1:41:42] say that the message did not die with
[1:41:46] William brandham and the Holy Spirit is
[1:41:50] here to to Quicken it even to Sister
[1:41:53] charity and to Sister Haven we need the
[1:41:57] anointing of the Hool come on Church
[1:42:00] we're not getting them to a man we're
[1:42:03] getting them to the
[1:42:07] message we're getting them to Jesus
[1:42:14] Christ he says well this this brother we
[1:42:18] all know him but I'm not going to
[1:42:20] mention his name
[1:42:22] well you don't even know you don't even
[1:42:25] know how to lead anyone to the Lord you
[1:42:26] won't even know brother Wendell how to
[1:42:28] how to how to deliver alcoholics and
[1:42:30] thing I said excuse
[1:42:34] me he said it's sad when the message has
[1:42:37] to send folks to the Baptist to get
[1:42:40] saved and that way we can come in and
[1:42:42] then educate them
[1:42:44] afterwards I said you brother have got
[1:42:47] you you have you're you're you're you're
[1:42:49] you're looking at things the wrong wrong
[1:42:50] filter you're preaching through the
[1:42:52] wrong filter come on church that's the
[1:42:55] reason why amen he was uncomfortable
[1:42:57] when we tried to preach about the seals
[1:42:58] when we tried to preach about the power
[1:43:00] of the Living God today he was wanting
[1:43:01] to point it all the way back all
[1:43:03] Jeffersonville Jeffersonville
[1:43:04] Jeffersonville brother Jeffersonville is
[1:43:06] not our headquarters Jeffersonville is
[1:43:09] not the one that we answer to we answer
[1:43:12] to the Living
[1:43:15] [Applause]
[1:43:18] God can you say Amen
[1:43:22] point the
[1:43:24] people to
[1:43:29] Christ sir and if you point them to
[1:43:32] Christ you'll point them to the message
[1:43:36] of the
[1:43:41] hour and you'll be preaching under the
[1:43:43] same anointing and it won't be under
[1:43:46] this slant or that slant or this slant
[1:43:48] or that slant then you can quote any
[1:43:51] quote you want to and you're going to
[1:43:53] amen it that's
[1:43:57] right oh it's Freedom brother it's
[1:43:59] Freedom when you can when you can look
[1:44:01] when you can look into the message and
[1:44:03] believe every bit of it it's Freedom
[1:44:06] when when a preacher can stand up and
[1:44:07] and preach preachers quotes that others
[1:44:11] are saying don't belong in the message
[1:44:13] anymore because we got a more perfect
[1:44:15] way the prophet did not say we have a
[1:44:17] more perfect way he says preachers
[1:44:20] preach this
[1:44:25] message why because it's not in words
[1:44:29] it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:44:32] upon that
[1:44:36] word can you say
[1:44:39] Amen well I found too many faults with
[1:44:41] preachers so I don't believe in
[1:44:43] Preachers
[1:44:44] anymore
[1:44:46] Hallelujah well then won't you divorce
[1:44:48] your
[1:44:49] wife
[1:44:52] Hallelujah because I'm here to tell you
[1:44:54] your wife is pretty
[1:44:55] faulty and you can't believe in marriage
[1:44:58] anymore or you can understand that that
[1:45:01] little lady loves you and that you love
[1:45:06] her and y'all can get prayed
[1:45:10] through because God has ordained
[1:45:13] marriage and God is ordained well glory
[1:45:16] to God are y'all with me here this
[1:45:18] morning yes sir
[1:45:21] Jesus says I'm the anointed word and you
[1:45:23] can read this amen John in the sixth
[1:45:25] chapter I'm fixing a cut in amen and
[1:45:28] he's said you know you want you to eat
[1:45:29] my word Eat My Flesh and drink my blood
[1:45:32] and the disciples were all bowled up
[1:45:35] well I I I amen and then Jesus comes in
[1:45:38] and says as the living
[1:45:40] father hath sent
[1:45:45] me and I live by the father so he that
[1:45:51] eateth me even he shall live by me this
[1:45:55] is the bread which came down from heaven
[1:45:57] not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[1:46:01] dead he that eateth this bread shall
[1:46:03] live forever these things said he in the
[1:46:05] synagogue as he taught in capernium
[1:46:07] many therefore of his disciples when
[1:46:10] they heard this said this is a hard
[1:46:11] saying who can hear it and when Jesus
[1:46:13] knew it himself his disciples murmured
[1:46:15] at it he said unto them does this offend
[1:46:19] you
[1:46:21] what and if ye shall see the son of man
[1:46:23] Ascend up where he was before it is the
[1:46:26] spirit that
[1:46:28] quickeneth the flesh profit of nothing
[1:46:31] but the words that I speak unto you are
[1:46:35] they are spirit and they are alive can
[1:46:38] you say Amen acts 10 and 38 I don't have
[1:46:41] it here but you can put it up there
[1:46:43] sister Keys acts 10 and
[1:46:45] 38 God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[1:46:50] the Holy Ghost and with
[1:46:53] power he was not just a letter not just
[1:46:57] a word he was
[1:47:01] anointed who went about doing good and
[1:47:03] healing all the sick all that were
[1:47:06] oppressed of the devil for God was with
[1:47:09] him can you say
[1:47:11] Amen now a l intellectual faith is not
[1:47:16] God's
[1:47:19] intent there was someone preaching on
[1:47:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost here some
[1:47:22] time
[1:47:24] back and people were really touched of
[1:47:28] God and and were seeking for the Holy
[1:47:31] Ghost saying I I he says I don't care if
[1:47:34] you've been in this message for a long
[1:47:36] time if you don't have the life of God
[1:47:38] in you and the Holy Spirit was there to
[1:47:39] back it up and the Holy Ghost was moving
[1:47:42] and people were
[1:47:43] weeping some was even at the altars and
[1:47:46] some were weeping before
[1:47:48] God when the service was turned back
[1:47:51] over a man stood
[1:47:53] up
[1:47:56] irritated and he says who believes this
[1:48:00] message well hundreds of hands went up
[1:48:03] he says you've got the Holy
[1:48:07] Ghost turned around dismissed the
[1:48:10] service do you not realize that the
[1:48:13] Devils
[1:48:15] believe and
[1:48:19] tremble
[1:48:20] we're not
[1:48:22] here with intellectualism trying to
[1:48:26] convince you that this message is
[1:48:31] right you will have to have the same
[1:48:34] power of the holy spirit that made Jesus
[1:48:37] Christ the word made
[1:48:39] flesh to make you the word made flesh in
[1:48:43] this day it will
[1:48:45] take don't you allow this message
[1:48:49] Hallelujah to become part of your
[1:48:53] brain God's looking for word made flesh
[1:48:58] he's wanting to anoint his word for this
[1:49:02] day and make you
[1:49:08] Messiah not intellectual
[1:49:11] Giants not somebody that knows all the
[1:49:14] quotes he's wanting somebody he can live
[1:49:19] through
[1:49:27] right psychology is the study of mind
[1:49:29] and
[1:49:33] behavior
[1:49:35] psychology you
[1:49:37] know searches for how the mind
[1:49:42] works and how it affects the
[1:49:45] behavior psychologist treats
[1:49:48] patients through psycho
[1:49:52] therapy so they
[1:49:54] take them to in order to get them out of
[1:49:57] their
[1:49:58] rut they introduce a new form of
[1:50:05] thought so when they introduce this new
[1:50:08] form of thought they're no longer
[1:50:11] thinking like they
[1:50:17] were what an
[1:50:19] example
[1:50:20] if uh for for those that are for someone
[1:50:23] that is addicted to
[1:50:28] pornography the
[1:50:30] psychologist on any kind on any kind of
[1:50:33] these kinds of addictions it always
[1:50:35] includes a
[1:50:37] psychologist and this this
[1:50:40] psychologist will go through go through
[1:50:42] their
[1:50:44] past but then will also begins to bring
[1:50:48] the realities that they they have not
[1:50:50] been thinking about
[1:50:52] supposedly they do
[1:50:55] this what is it doing to your
[1:50:58] wife think about your
[1:51:01] wife what is it doing to your children
[1:51:04] what are they doing they are introducing
[1:51:06] new
[1:51:08] thoughts and hopefully those thoughts
[1:51:10] will become
[1:51:12] greater than the thoughts of naked
[1:51:16] women so what they do is they introduce
[1:51:20] and they want you to begin to
[1:51:23] look
[1:51:25] Hallelujah now I I'm I'm I'm fixing to
[1:51:28] hit you we might have to take this off
[1:51:29] the internet praise the Lord amen did
[1:51:32] you
[1:51:33] realize that that was almost exactly
[1:51:36] word for word what was said by a message
[1:51:38] man that said that he was in he was in
[1:51:41] pornography and been prayed for and
[1:51:42] prayed for he says and finally he said I
[1:51:46] started Overcoming By thinking what it's
[1:51:48] doing to my children what is it's doing
[1:51:50] to my wife what it's doing to this how
[1:51:52] it's bad for me and slowly i' I'm I'm I
[1:51:56] I've overcome it that ain't overcome it
[1:51:58] that is mind over matter that is a
[1:51:59] change of thought the preacher is not
[1:52:02] Amen to introduce psychology the
[1:52:04] preacher is to preach the word under the
[1:52:11] anointing can you say
[1:52:13] amen amen let me tell you something the
[1:52:18] psychologist will treat the preach the
[1:52:21] helping to
[1:52:23] relieve the the the
[1:52:25] symptoms through be a behavioral
[1:52:28] change teaching you a new way a new
[1:52:33] form and then he'll prescribe either
[1:52:35] medication or you you know some some
[1:52:38] kind of intervention to help man manage
[1:52:41] the the the the the the the health
[1:52:43] conditions of your mind amen but that's
[1:52:47] not the way that matters of fact you go
[1:52:49] back go back go back and look at what
[1:52:51] brother brandham talked about because
[1:52:53] back in brother bram's days they were
[1:52:54] trying to get them to pass a
[1:52:56] psychological test before you were able
[1:52:59] to be a preacher in some of these
[1:53:00] denominations brother Bram says can you
[1:53:02] imagine
[1:53:03] Peter sitting before a
[1:53:06] psychologist could you imagine those
[1:53:08] disciples sitting before a
[1:53:11] psychologist he said this ain't
[1:53:13] psychology this is the power of God
[1:53:15] under
[1:53:18] salvation but when we start using this
[1:53:20] message amen as as sort of a a a
[1:53:24] different form a different way and
[1:53:26] changing your you know behavioral
[1:53:28] patterns I'm not looking for someone to
[1:53:29] start wearing skirts down their ankles
[1:53:31] I'm not looking for someone to keep
[1:53:32] their hair H H uh you know long I'm not
[1:53:35] looking for someone to start being good
[1:53:36] to their husband and their wives I'm
[1:53:38] looking for something to happen way down
[1:53:40] deep inside I'm looking for New Birth
[1:53:42] I'm looking for the power of the Holy
[1:53:44] Spirit I'm looking for the Holy Spirit
[1:53:48] New Birth in the church
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:57] Church preachers aren't commissioned to
[1:54:00] teach them how to deal with it preachers
[1:54:02] are commissioned to cast The Devil
[1:54:10] out now the spirit the holy spirit is
[1:54:14] still the discerner of
[1:54:16] Hearts he still knows what you need
[1:54:21] he still knows where your hangup
[1:54:23] is he knows how to set you
[1:54:26] free he still has a
[1:54:28] sword come on sword of the spirit can
[1:54:32] you say Amen the gospel does not deal
[1:54:35] with your psyche the gospel does not
[1:54:37] deal with your intellectualism amen your
[1:54:40] your mind the gospel deals with the soul
[1:54:44] and setting the captives
[1:54:48] free
[1:54:52] praise the
[1:54:53] Lord fear is a
[1:54:56] spirit and must be cast
[1:55:02] off pornography is a devil and must be
[1:55:06] cast
[1:55:09] out these are
[1:55:11] devils and it
[1:55:14] requires the
[1:55:17] anointing can you say that
[1:55:21] brother brandham talking about John
[1:55:24] Jesus talking about John and brother
[1:55:26] brandham is referring he said no wonder
[1:55:28] Jesus said what did you go out to
[1:55:30] see and that forgetting for uh forgotten
[1:55:33] beatitude as I preached on it when he
[1:55:35] went across the hill the Disciples of
[1:55:38] John said he said what what did you go
[1:55:40] out to see a man dressed in fine
[1:55:43] clothes he said that that's the kind
[1:55:46] that they'll call Doctor Holy Father
[1:55:48] father they wear soft clothes and they
[1:55:50] kiss the babies and they marry the young
[1:55:52] and they bury the old he handles a pen
[1:55:55] knife what would a man like that know
[1:55:58] about a two two-handed sword on the
[1:56:01] front
[1:56:04] Battlefront he said do you do do you see
[1:56:06] a man dressed with a priest's robe soft
[1:56:10] clothing he said that kind of
[1:56:13] preacher did did you see that go to see
[1:56:16] that he said no them kind kiss the
[1:56:18] babies you know bury the dead they don't
[1:56:21] know nothing about a two-handed sword of
[1:56:23] the on the
[1:56:23] Battlefront they're out there with some
[1:56:25] kind of intellectual speech to the
[1:56:28] kaanas club and some or something and
[1:56:30] you know and they're all they're all
[1:56:33] right
[1:56:34] there but when it comes out to the
[1:56:36] battle to face
[1:56:38] it they know nothing about
[1:56:41] it now as I begin to wind down here this
[1:56:48] morning Preacher God don't want
[1:56:53] explainers there's a difference in a
[1:56:56] proclaimer and an
[1:56:58] explainer proclaiming the proclamation
[1:57:01] of what he saw what he
[1:57:03] knows what he's experienced with
[1:57:08] God in that room all by yourself alone
[1:57:11] with God saying God I need something to
[1:57:14] feed your
[1:57:16] people something that your anointing is
[1:57:18] going to back up

[1:57:25] intellect an explainer
[1:57:29] is he's a
[1:57:31] newscaster he's
[1:57:33] a that's those are the talking heads
[1:57:36] that that dig down and try
[1:57:42] to if you can get talked into it you can
[1:57:45] get talked out of
[1:57:48] it am I am am I making that clear this
[1:57:50] morning am I doing all right if you can
[1:57:53] get talked into
[1:57:57] it out there in that parking lot sitting

[1:58:01] day he said I'm giving you proof brother
[1:58:03] Wendell I'm giving you
[1:58:11] proof I said the bridge didn't attract
[1:58:18] me
[1:58:22] that didn't you're you're look you're
[1:58:24] you're looking at
[1:58:25] all the
[1:58:27] word attracted
[1:58:35] me I said you're talking to the wrong
[1:58:39] guy I came out of
[1:58:43] Pentecostalism that's all we done was
[1:58:45] measured each other with measuring
[1:58:47] sticks that's all we done
[1:58:50] was trying to be more spiritual than
[1:58:52] everyone
[1:58:56] else that was denominationalism trying
[1:58:58] to divide and divide this one looking
[1:59:00] more spiritual than this and I said and
[1:59:01] all I can see in this is just a big mess
[1:59:02] everyone's all trying to get get their
[1:59:04] corner on the message I said what got me
[1:59:06] was the message and the only thing
[1:59:08] attracted me was the purity of it and
[1:59:11] you can't take that from
[1:59:16] me oh come on I've had the guy say man
[1:59:20] with your talent and with your gifts and
[1:59:22] you're preaching what would you come
[1:59:24] join our group I don't want to join a
[1:59:26] group I have joined Heaven's
[1:59:30] group I'm standing with this word can I
[1:59:34] hear an
[1:59:38] amen
[1:59:40] hallelujah then when you
[1:59:43] look and you genuinely
[1:59:46] look and you genuinely took take the
[1:59:49] word you're not going to take one little
[1:59:52] portion of brother
[1:59:53] brandham to pit another
[1:59:56] portion well praise the
[1:59:58] Lord do you love
[2:00:02] him you're not going to pit with this
[2:00:04] one and that one against this one and
[2:00:06] this one against that one and Hallelujah
[2:00:09] brother bradam says or Jesus says I want
[2:00:11] you to Beware of the Leen of the
[2:00:14] Pharisees and when they were looking at
[2:00:16] him then then then Jesus says the
[2:00:18] doctrine when they were tooking at the
[2:00:20] leav they were talking they were
[2:00:21] thinking about bread and this that and
[2:00:22] the other and then he finally saysi want
[2:00:24] you to be H uh uh
[2:00:26] cautious about the
[2:00:29] doctrine of the
[2:00:31] Pharisees their teachings is unbelief
[2:00:35] their doctrines are unbelief and a
[2:00:39] little bit of that leaven will mess you
[2:00:47] up well praise the Lord
[2:00:50] praise the Lord now we can pick on a
[2:00:53] bunch of Knuckleheads outside that we
[2:00:54] knows went way off but what about some
[2:00:56] of our knucklehead
[2:00:59] ideas where we've got our own pet little
[2:01:02] deals and we're deliberately excusing
[2:01:06] what brother what don't y'all stop
[2:01:07] preaching with me
[2:01:09] now where brother bradam clearly
[2:01:12] taught going to church every time the
[2:01:15] door is open and you want to excuse that
[2:01:18] and you're claiming you're following the
[2:01:20] message there's some
[2:01:26] leav I said there's some
[2:01:30] leaven you've got to take every word
[2:01:32] don't you let Satan talk one bit from
[2:01:35] [Applause]
[2:01:42] you
[2:01:44] Hallelujah you want to take the gifts ah
[2:01:48] we don't believe
[2:01:49] that's not that you you might get that
[2:01:52] from your talking points from your
[2:01:54] Talking Heads but you're not getting it
[2:01:55] from God's Bible and you sure didn't get
[2:01:57] it from William
[2:02:01] Brown well praise the
[2:02:04] Lord amen
[2:02:07] now brother random did warn
[2:02:10] us he said
[2:02:12] now he says Paul saw it
[2:02:15] coming he warned that this little subtle
[2:02:17] priesthood
[2:02:19] that would come and take over with false
[2:02:22] doctrines he knew they would Implement a
[2:02:24] way of worship that excluded the people
[2:02:26] from any part of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:28] Ministry and even right among us today
[2:02:30] those who claim to be free and full of
[2:02:32] the spirit there's not too much freedom
[2:02:33] in the leoty best we can see is a few
[2:02:36] preachers with inspired preaching while
[2:02:37] the flock just sits there and tries to
[2:02:39] absorb it that's a far cry from Paul who
[2:02:42] said that when all come together all had
[2:02:45] the leading of the spirit and all
[2:02:47] participated in spiritual worship and
[2:02:50] the church corporate never learns this
[2:02:53] lesson from the scripture nor from
[2:02:55] history every time the God gives a
[2:02:59] visitation of the Holy Spirit and the
[2:03:00] people get free after a while they bind
[2:03:03] themselves right back to the very thing
[2:03:06] they came out of when Luther left out of
[2:03:08] Catholicism the people stayed free for a
[2:03:10] while when he died then they simply
[2:03:12] organized and they thought they uh they
[2:03:15] what they thought they believed and set
[2:03:16] up the Creeds and ideas and repudiated
[2:03:18] any that said opposite to what they said
[2:03:21] they went right back into
[2:03:23] Catholicism with a little bit different
[2:03:28] form well praise the
[2:03:30] Lord amen little bit different form
[2:03:35] now amen now that there was in
[2:03:40] the that that there was in the in the
[2:03:42] church age book amen there in in the
[2:03:46] Ephesian church and um
[2:03:49] the the fisan church age amen here's
[2:03:53] another one from the church age book he
[2:03:55] says but as usual God don't people don't
[2:03:57] heed God's warning the Revival fire
[2:04:00] built upon the sacred word is so
[2:04:01] wonderful the manifestation of the
[2:04:03] spirit is so blessed that after that a
[2:04:05] little fear Creeps in and a whisper in
[2:04:08] the heart says how can we protect this
[2:04:10] truth we have what can we do to see the
[2:04:13] Revival goes on that is when the
[2:04:16] Antichrist comes in and Whispers look
[2:04:19] you have the truth now see that it
[2:04:21] doesn't get lost organize set up your
[2:04:24] Creed of what you believe and put it in
[2:04:26] a church manual and they do it they
[2:04:29] organize they add to the word and they
[2:04:31] die just like Eve died taking one wrong
[2:04:33] word it's God's word that brings life
[2:04:37] and it's not what we say about the word
[2:04:39] that counts it's what God
[2:04:44] says
[2:04:46] hallelujah well praise the lord we we
[2:04:48] have relied upon the intellectual side
[2:04:52] of this message and we need to take
[2:04:56] every word and say Amen to
[2:05:02] it well praise the Lord am I doing all
[2:05:06] right here this morning I'm feeling
[2:05:08] pretty good I I right now I could
[2:05:10] probably preach Without You amen but
[2:05:11] it's good to have an amen
[2:05:14] hallelujah amen that's right now brother
[2:05:17] Brandon would say
[2:05:19] and your sincerity and all that you want
[2:05:21] to confess you just want to take it to
[2:05:23] the ma Methodist altar the Baptist altar
[2:05:25] the Pentecostal altar but there is an
[2:05:27] altar somewhere that he has chose to put
[2:05:29] his name in and and he would meet you at
[2:05:33] now if you get everything running just
[2:05:35] right you're going to run everything's
[2:05:37] set in order if there's a short in that
[2:05:39] wire the light won't come on because
[2:05:41] it's been grounded and when you take one
[2:05:43] of God's word or one of his places and
[2:05:46] in your heart have a selfish objective
[2:05:48] it'll ground the power of God right
[2:05:50] there if you do it because you want to
[2:05:53] be smart you want to be different from
[2:05:54] somebody else or something right there
[2:05:57] it's grounded it blows the fuse you're
[2:05:59] wrong you've got to come back with

[2:06:38] of the Holy Ghost bring Salvation to
[2:06:41] those
[2:06:47] kids you've got a
[2:06:50] choice but it's usually a bunch of
[2:06:52] backsliding folks that don't want to
[2:06:54] take what brother brandham says and it's
[2:06:56] their children that pays the
[2:07:00] price I've been scarred well welcome to
[2:07:03] the
[2:07:05] club Hallelujah let's share some
[2:07:08] scars I've been scarred badly I've been
[2:07:11] scarred I've been scarred by preachers
[2:07:14] I've been hurt I've been hurt to the
[2:07:17] quick I've been hurt I didn't think that
[2:07:19] I'd ever
[2:07:22] recover but God healed
[2:07:25] me and I've also got something to tell
[2:07:27] you too you've hurt me
[2:07:32] too so am I going to quit believing in
[2:07:34] the body of Christ am I going to
[2:07:36] separate myself from
[2:07:38] you because you've hurt
[2:07:40] me well I know my personality I know I
[2:07:44] like to gab and I know I've hurt
[2:07:47] you
[2:07:51] some of you are just
[2:07:53] surprised yeah
[2:07:55] yeah I have the capability of hurting
[2:08:02] people but that doesn't take away from
[2:08:06] uh Romans the 12th
[2:08:07] chapter sir that says we're onebody many
[2:08:12] members and we've all got to be fitly
[2:08:14] framed
[2:08:17] together
[2:08:20] it doesn't take away from
[2:08:22] that it just means I need a little bit
[2:08:24] of blood and you need a little bit of
[2:08:27] blood and we got to give the preacher a
[2:08:29] little bit of grace and the preacher
[2:08:31] needs to give you a little bit of Grace
[2:08:33] and if he is a true preacher he'll
[2:08:35] always line himself back up with the
[2:08:37] word listen my message is not infallible
[2:08:41] but the M time message is
[2:08:45] infallible I can make up I can make
[2:08:48] Stakes I've had to stand up behind the
[2:08:49] pull pit and say guys I got it
[2:08:53] wrong I preached an entire sermon one
[2:08:57] time I preached an entire sermon
[2:09:01] Amen on on the when you're on when

[2:09:27] thread well praise the
[2:09:30] Lord Brother brandom said 500 one time
[2:09:33] instead of or 700
[2:09:36] 7,000 amen but that didn't make him a a
[2:09:39] bad
[2:09:40] profit but I'm going to tell you
[2:09:41] something they on the seals when brother
[2:09:42] brandom said something and all of a
[2:09:44] sudden the spirit of God just came in
[2:09:45] the room he felt like death in he says
[2:09:49] something's happening something someone
[2:09:50] everyone okay I feel death someone says
[2:09:53] go back and read that scripture again
[2:09:55] and what he was putting to the Jews it
[2:09:57] was to the bride or vice versa y'all
[2:09:59] remember that the angel of the Lord was
[2:10:01] correcting brother brandom in the
[2:10:04] seals that's right you know why because
[2:10:07] you're going to have to get it right and
[2:10:09] that's the reason why us preachers are
[2:10:10] got to get it right we got to get it
[2:10:12] right we got to preach it right we got
[2:10:13] to preach under the anointing of the
[2:10:15] Holy Spirit we got to say it the way the
[2:10:17] prophet says it we got to believe it the
[2:10:18] way the prophet believed
[2:10:24] it well praise the
[2:10:27] Lord
[2:10:29] now
[2:10:30] amen I'm I'm I'm trying to find a way to
[2:10:33] pull over here hallelujah amen do you
[2:10:36] love him yes amen now when we when we
[2:10:43] look
[2:10:46] here brother brother brandham
[2:10:49] in the
[2:10:51] indictment he he puts it pretty clear
[2:10:56] what you do when you take one word
[2:10:59] someone say one word word and you
[2:11:02] misplace it now let me just put it let
[2:11:05] me let me put it clearly it's one thing
[2:11:08] to
[2:11:10] misplace this written
[2:11:12] word when you've got a million different
[2:11:15] interpretations correct brother brandham
[2:11:18] says how can he fault a man when you
[2:11:19] don't know which way to go but when God
[2:11:22] sends a messenger yes sir and the pillar
[2:11:26] of fire has come down to vindicate that
[2:11:29] message and for you to Discount what he
[2:11:32] is
[2:11:38] saying this the way brother Brenham put
[2:11:43] it you know he was he was talking he
[2:11:47] says uh
[2:11:50] uh he said thee same thing happens right
[2:11:52] here I'm cutting in this indictment he
[2:11:55] said exactly the same thing
[2:11:57] again let me just go up and just just
[2:11:59] just read the whole thing he says as I
[2:12:01] said about that Minister last Sunday
[2:12:04] Martin Luther King down there with them
[2:12:06] precious people leading them right into
[2:12:07] a death trap oh if somebody could only
[2:12:10] talk to that man I wish I could just for
[2:12:13] a little uprising of the school
[2:12:14] proposition see it's a lot of different
[2:12:17] it's it's a lot differ
[2:12:18] my goodness if the people ain't got
[2:12:21] heart enough to associate with a man
[2:12:23] because of his color they're condemned
[2:12:25] and dead
[2:12:27] anyhow he says what if what what if
[2:12:29] somebody said all the Irish or somebody
[2:12:31] all the German or somebody else that had
[2:12:34] to disassociate that would never bother
[2:12:36] Christians that'd move right
[2:12:38] on that man's a Christian as a minister
[2:12:41] he shouldn't be he shouldn't lead the
[2:12:43] people into a Revolt like that against
[2:12:45] that they're going to cause Millions to
[2:12:47] die die it it'll start another
[2:12:50] revolutionary it's a shame to do that
[2:12:52] now now watch now watch how he's how
[2:12:54] he's tying this in he says the same
[2:12:56] thing happens right here exactly the
[2:12:59] same thing again that's right the people
[2:13:02] how that only look at truth and see the
[2:13:04] truth what the truth is our church don't
[2:13:07] believe that we got some other way we
[2:13:10] ain't well it ain't the right way it
[2:13:13] ain't it ain't the thing he said repent
[2:13:15] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:13:16] name of Jesus Christ from the of sins
[2:13:19] now they won't do it oh they what then
[2:13:23] what do they do uh that's just one thing
[2:13:27] out of hundreds we'll get to maybe as as
[2:13:30] fast as we can now the second crucifix
[2:13:34] crucifixion then if a man accepts Father
[2:13:36] Son and the Holy Ghost a Creed instead
[2:13:37] of the word titles instead of the name
[2:13:40] what does he the preacher do to the
[2:13:42] people he crucifies the effects of the
[2:13:45] word to the people when he says mark 16
[2:13:48] was just for that generation and God
[2:13:52] himself said uh God said himself right
[2:13:55] there Jesus talking to them go you andw
[2:13:58] all the world and preach the gospel to
[2:14:00] every creature and he that believeth in
[2:14:02] is baptized shall be saved and he that
[2:14:03] believeth not shall be damned and these
[2:14:05] signs shall follow them how far Every
[2:14:06] Nation every Creed every tongue every
[2:14:09] race every people and the same God these
[2:14:12] signs shall follow them and when a man
[2:14:14] tries to cut that out of the Bible he
[2:14:17] crucifies the effects to that
[2:14:19] congregation so I indict you in the name
[2:14:22] of Jesus Christ you're guilty of
[2:14:25] murdering the Lord the church hated him
[2:14:28] why he was their God they hated him and
[2:14:31] denied him to be the
[2:14:33] Messiah no sir they didn't want such a
[2:14:36] messiah as that and today the church
[2:14:38] does the same thing it denies the word
[2:14:41] they don't want it it's contradictory to
[2:14:42] what they have been taught to believe by
[2:14:44] their Creeds the word is the Messiah you
[2:14:47] believe that that well the reflection of
[2:14:49] the word is then is what a reflecting
[2:14:51] Messiah is the Holy Ghost Among Us he's
[2:14:56] reflecting himself wherever he can find
[2:15:00] a lamp that he can look through and that
[2:15:02] ain't smoked up with Creeds and things
[2:15:04] he can give that light can you say
[2:15:07] Amen now now now hear
[2:15:10] me hear me because we're not talking
[2:15:14] about we're not talking about
[2:15:15] denomination I'm talking about the
[2:15:17] denominations inside this
[2:15:19] message will you give me a few more
[2:15:21] minutes how long have I been up here oh
[2:15:24] my goodness oh my goodness no wonder
[2:15:26] we're all getting tired
[2:15:29] hallelujah what about when brother
[2:15:30] Brandon was asked would the bride have a
[2:15:34] Ministry would the bride of Christ have
[2:15:36] a Ministry before the Rapture now
[2:15:38] brother Brandon was still under the
[2:15:39] anointing this is the question answers
[2:15:41] in the seals it's the same oneand that
[2:15:43] brother brandom when he's given the
[2:15:44] wrong interpretation or he was he and it
[2:15:46] wasn't he was he just misread the
[2:15:48] scripture and someone says go back and
[2:15:50] read that scripture again and then he he
[2:15:53] goes oh brother see how how the holy
[2:15:56] spirit is so accurate remember that he
[2:15:59] saids will the bride have a Ministry the
[2:16:01] question he said sure that's what's
[2:16:02] going on now
[2:16:04] certainly the bride of Christ it's the
[2:16:07] message of the hour the bride of Christ
[2:16:09] she consists of Apostles prophets
[2:16:11] teachers evangelists and pastors that's
[2:16:14] the bride of Christ sure she's got a
[2:16:16] Ministry it's a great ministry it's the
[2:16:19] ministry of the hour can you say
[2:16:23] amen

[2:16:31] anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has
[2:16:33] come he's my teacher when you get that
[2:16:37] idea you're just wrong for why did the
[2:16:40] Holy Spirit the holy go set teachers in
[2:16:43] the church if he was going to be the
[2:16:45] teacher there are first apostles
[2:16:47] prophets teachers evangelists and
[2:16:49] pastors the Holy Spirit set the teachers
[2:16:52] in the church so he could teach to that
[2:16:54] teacher it isn't according and if it
[2:16:57] isn't according to the word God doesn't
[2:17:00] confirm it it isn't the right kind of
[2:17:04] teaching it must compare with the entire
[2:17:08] Bible be just as alive today as it was

[2:21:14] this he said go preach the gospel and
[2:21:16] these signs shall follow the
[2:21:19] preaching let's not learn to make a
[2:21:21] lecturer who can stand and just put them
[2:21:24] flowery things out in in that make you
[2:21:27] feel like you're sitting right in the
[2:21:28] presence of an archangel that isn't it
[2:21:31] having forms of godliness he that's a
[2:21:34] lecture not the Holy Spirit In Action
[2:21:37] some little fell that wouldn't know his
[2:21:38] ABCs might come down with the power of
[2:21:40] Faith with the word and make the spirit
[2:21:42] do things that that man knows nothing
[2:21:45] about and Den iing see there you
[2:21:49] are then there are the organizers
[2:21:51] they're prosperous they're successful
[2:21:54] smart a worldly wisdom just exactly like
[2:21:57] Satan did to
[2:21:59] Eve that little helpless woman he came
[2:22:02] right to her and tried to sell her on
[2:22:03] the idea that she could be wiser than
[2:22:06] what she was and that's what she was
[2:22:08] looking for instead of staying right
[2:22:10] there with the word what the word
[2:22:12] said he wanted to sell her on the idea
[2:22:14] that she could be
[2:22:16] wiser and she brought his
[2:22:21] product he says you don't scientifically
[2:22:23] prove God you believe God you believe it
[2:22:26] if you don't believe it then a man that
[2:22:28] says everything is not uh that a man
[2:22:31] says not scientif it's it's un
[2:22:33] Orthodox is not right then that man can
[2:22:36] ever be a Christian he has to believe by
[2:22:40] faith we believe God not by education
[2:22:43] not by theology but by faith you are
[2:22:46] saved
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:49] said notice Faith finds a source that
[2:22:51] others don't see his word is a sword
[2:22:55] Hebrews 4 and12 said that in that is the
[2:22:58] word the word of God is sharper than a
[2:23:00] two-edged sword even discerns the
[2:23:02] thoughts that's intense that's in the
[2:23:07] heart that's the word of God the only
[2:23:09] thing that can hold the sword is a hand
[2:23:11] of Faith nothing else can do it nothing
[2:23:13] else somebody say nothing
[2:23:15] else yeah you have to see something in
[2:23:18] otherwise scientific you scientifically
[2:23:21] educationally you cannot hold that sword
[2:23:24] you cannot do it by education it's too
[2:23:26] Twisted it's too
[2:23:30] complicated it'll deny itself and
[2:23:32] everything you can't do it Jesus says
[2:23:34] it's hid from you so forget about it you
[2:23:38] cannot know it it's hid when God hides
[2:23:41] anything it's really
[2:23:43] hid can you say am man so what do we
[2:23:48] do we don't try to figure it
[2:23:52] [Music]
[2:23:54] out We
[2:23:57] [Music]

[2:27:15] God you're held in the palm of his hand
[2:27:18] that little special something in you
[2:27:21] that is
[2:27:22] saying I want you I want your
[2:27:27] will that little something deep down
[2:27:29] inside your soul that is saying
[2:27:33] Lord take anything that is not right
[2:27:36] with you
[2:27:39] out if you're using this message for a
[2:27:44] crutch God's not wanting you to to use
[2:27:47] it for a crutch he's wanting you to use
[2:27:48] it for a
[2:27:55] sword this morning as I have
[2:27:59] preached some things I've hit
[2:28:03] hard and I have felt these last two
[2:28:06] services that where where I have
[2:28:07] preached in the doctrine of unbelief and
[2:28:10] how that comes from the pull
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:15] pit
[2:28:21] just because there's so much nonsense
[2:28:23] doesn't mean that God's not
[2:28:27] real and just because someone says God
[2:28:30] doesn't filled with the Holy Ghost like
[2:28:31] he used to doesn't mean that he
[2:28:34] do and just because people say that
[2:28:36] there's no healing anymore
[2:28:39] listen if you can believe
[2:28:42] it if you can believe it with all of
[2:28:45] your heart
[2:28:47] you can have exactly what the Bible says
[2:28:50] you can
[2:28:52] have if you can believe
[2:28:55] it but you're going to have to get rid
[2:28:57] of some of those
[2:29:00] old tabletop quotes and some of those oh
[2:29:04] I thinking well this is my opinion you
[2:29:07] got to get that all off and you've got
[2:29:09] to come right back to what was set on
[2:29:11] the
[2:29:12] tapes you got to believe every word of
[2:29:14] it now
[2:29:17] can you say
[2:29:20] man I love him
[2:29:23] today you want a refilling of the Holy
[2:29:25] Ghost this
[2:29:27] morning let him refill you you've got
[2:29:31] some areas in your life maybe you've got
[2:29:32] some maybe you've got
[2:29:34] some some little leaven that's that's
[2:29:38] that you've overlooked that's in the
[2:29:39] corner of your
[2:29:40] [Music]
[2:29:42] heart would you take the candle here
[2:29:44] this morning and
[2:29:47] take your little broom and sweep up all
[2:29:50] of the

[2:30:00] me take everything about
[2:30:06] me I know I'm a human being and I know
[2:30:08] I'm

[2:30:45] power it'll never never lose its effect
[2:30:47] if you can see yourself in that word
[2:30:49] maybe the mirror is not reflecting the
[2:30:51] way it should there's plenty of blood
[2:30:56] there there's plenty of
[2:30:59] blood he loves you this morning oh God

[2:47:54] amen want to keep him in our
[2:47:58] prayer um one other thing is you you
[2:48:02] notice where sister khila has parked the
[2:48:04] last couple
[2:48:05] Services we are we are trying to save
[2:48:08] that spot that's going east and
[2:48:11] west uh right out there about 10 feet
[2:48:15] along at the sidewalk going east and
[2:48:17] west out on the end so sister Cela can
[2:48:18] just pull right up in there and and we
[2:48:21] can get sister
[2:48:22] Tracy uh uh right there on the sidewalk
[2:48:26] and uh so we she don't have to uh uh be
[2:48:30] pulled on the gravel and how many's
[2:48:32] enjoyed sister Tracy being with us
[2:48:36] amen we sure love sister
[2:48:40] Tracy and um and so what what we'll do
[2:48:44] is just just and she's she's not parking
[2:48:46] traditionally she's parking right up
[2:48:49] just parallel with the sidewalk and you
[2:48:51] can see why uh when y'all go out there
[2:48:54] but if we could just do that just leave
[2:48:55] that 10 foot spot I I I know um I think
[2:49:00] Kobe and uh Caleb usually park right
[2:49:03] along that area but um so uh we just
[2:49:07] want to try to keep that spot open
[2:49:09] because sister CA is not going to always
[2:49:11] be uh pared there she she gets here and
[2:49:14] and and and uh gets her stuff together
[2:49:17] and then goes and picks her mom up and
[2:49:19] so we just want to make sure that and
[2:49:21] it's no big problem at all we don't want
[2:49:23] feel we we just want sister Tracy to
[2:49:25] feel really special she's got her own
[2:49:27] parking spot over there
