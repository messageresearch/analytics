of Heaven on Earth Lord during this weekend May we put aside the cares of the week and and the things we've gone through during the year Lord may you move in a way that only you can everything when he said it is finished amen your salvation was finished your healing was finished everything was finished at Calvary amen but but what good would that be if if there was not a people to show the victory of that amen and you're not standing by your own power you're not standing by your own will you're not standing by your own mind you're standing by the power of the spoken word build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it now how could you stand in this day without a message how could you stand in this day without a faith that was imparted to you amen God showed it God Vindicated

him in roll robes or or some kind of a Angelic garment or some kind of light where the people would know what it was where the denominations could see what it was and where everybody would recognize it but he came in such a way that only a man of Abraham's calber of Faith would be able to recognize who he was when he came anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride in the bridegroom where is the anointed word it's right here in Pony Oklahoma not the anointed not the anointed building not the anointed preacher but the anointed bride and bridegroom that's why you
