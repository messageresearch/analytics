[39:39] commit the service into your hands the
[39:41] name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[39:46] let's turn to First Corinthians chapter
[39:49] 13.
[39:57] I know this is going to be one of the
[39:59] most
[40:00] recognized sections of scripture
[40:03] I know as a
[40:05] a home school kid we every single year
[40:08] had a group of us that would memorize
[40:11] First Corinthians 13 with different hand
[40:14] motions to go with it
[40:18] they never did King James version though
[40:20] you always had to do a slightly
[40:21] different version to make it fit right I
[40:23] guess
[40:25] but we'll start at First Corinthians
[40:27] chapter 13 we'll
[40:28] just start at verse 1.
[40:33] though I speak with the tongues of men
[40:34] and of angels and have not charity I am
[40:38] become a sounding brass
[40:40] or a tinkling symbol
[40:43] you know what let's let's read this uh
[40:46] responsively back and forth so I'm going
[40:49] to have you all read verse two and we'll
[40:50] go ahead and go right through down to
[40:52] verse 13 so
[40:54] I'll read verse one again and then y'all
[40:56] can read verse two and we'll go from
[40:57] there
[40:58] though I speak with the tongues of men
[41:00] and of angels and have not charity I am
[41:03] become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[41:05] symbol
[41:06] s
[41:19] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[41:22] the poor and though I give my body to be
[41:24] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[41:27] me nothing
[41:30] in this time
[41:34] not itself is not but uh
[41:38] Charities suffereth long and is kind
[41:41] charity envieth not charityth vaunteth
[41:44] not itself is not puffed up
[41:56] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[41:59] in the truth
[42:04] oh
[42:06] because
[42:08] charity never faileth but where there be
[42:10] prophecies they shall fail
[42:13] where there be tongues they shall cease
[42:15] where there be knowledge it shall vanish
[42:18] away
[42:23] but when that which is perfect has come
[42:25] then that which is in part shall be done
[42:27] away
[42:37] I believe
[42:40] for now we see through a glass darkling
[42:42] but then face to face now I know in part
[42:45] but then I shall know even as also I am
[42:48] known
[42:50] by this faith hope charity these three
[42:54] are the greatest of these is Charity you
[42:58] can have your seats
[43:05] and this is
[43:09] I know that that uh probably felt like
[43:11] we were back in Sunday school and once
[43:13] again this is just something that was
[43:15] one of my Sunday school lessons that's
[43:17] kind of developed since then but
[43:20] um
[43:21] brother random said in the sermon in
[43:24] 1954 the seven Church ages said now John
[43:27] being old
[43:28] they are told by historians that he was
[43:30] brought to the church to preach and he
[43:33] was so old the only thing he would say
[43:34] was little children love one another
[43:37] I tell you that's a very good thing to
[43:39] preach on little children love one
[43:40] another as I get old in the ministry now
[43:43] and about in my 21st year I think all
[43:45] the time as I go along that the more I
[43:48] think of the Lord Jesus the more I begin
[43:49] to find out that it's love that covers
[43:51] the whole thing the love of God shed
[43:54] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit
[43:57] and in uh also in in 1954 and we would
[44:01] see Jesus he says the thing of it is
[44:04] Friends the human mind today without the
[44:06] inspiration of the Holy Ghost don't know
[44:08] what compassion means neither do you
[44:10] know what love means look at First
[44:12] Corinthians 13 how would you interpret
[44:15] First Corinthians 13 as love though I
[44:17] have all these fine gifts Paul said
[44:19] though I give my body to be burned a
[44:20] sacrifice for the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:22] though I give all my goods to feed the
[44:24] poor in everything isn't that love but
[44:27] that's not Bible love see you're talking
[44:28] about natural affection instead of
[44:31] divine revelation of the will of God
[44:35] brother Wendell uh
[44:37] as he has mentioned before preaches on
[44:41] love a lot and so I feel weird being the
[44:43] one to get up and now be the one
[44:45] ministering on it but
[44:46] um he actually mentioned just in the uh
[44:49] service on
[44:51] uh this past Wednesday night he
[44:53] mentioned
[44:54] um the different Greek words for love
[44:58] and he didn't go into them but I wanted
[44:59] to to touch on those just for a moment
[45:01] so the four biblical Greek words for
[45:03] love
[45:04] um the first one that's used uh is Eros
[45:07] which is used for sensual or romantic
[45:10] love
[45:11] um it's a love that is normally felt
[45:13] physically with within the body you then
[45:17] have philia love or deep friendship it's
[45:22] often referred to as a deep camaraderie
[45:25] friendship that's developed between
[45:26] Brothers in Arms who had fought side by
[45:28] side on the battlefield it's it's the
[45:31] most General type of love in the
[45:32] scriptures it's encompassing the love
[45:34] for fellow humans care respect and
[45:37] compassion for people in need
[45:40] there's then uh storage which is family
[45:44] relationships it's it's family love the
[45:47] the affectionate bond that develops
[45:48] naturally between parents and children
[45:51] and and brothers and sisters and then
[45:54] you have uh the one that we're in a lot
[45:56] of ways we talk about the most but agape
[45:58] love the the selfless unconditional love
[46:01] God's Own love it's the love of supreme
[46:04] greatness this term defines God's
[46:07] immeasurable incomparable love for
[46:09] humankind it's the Divine love that
[46:11] comes from God agape love is perfect
[46:14] unconditional sacrificial and pure
[46:19] you know in some ways I think that uh
[46:22] obviously the Greeks had a little bit
[46:23] better handle of love than we do because
[46:25] nowadays the word love has become so
[46:28] common and so cheap you know when with
[46:31] the Greeks having multiple words for it
[46:33] they could make it very clear of what
[46:34] they were talking about where we just
[46:37] use the word love to blanket everything
[46:39] and so
[46:41] um as as brother Wendell uh mentioned
[46:43] the other night you know they can say I
[46:45] love pizza
[46:46] I love the new app on my phone I uh I
[46:50] love this or I love that teenagers and
[46:54] young people in the world are are quick
[46:55] to declare their undying love before
[46:57] they really know anything about each
[46:59] other
[47:00] um you know when I was growing up and I
[47:02] mentioned this to brother Wendell the
[47:03] other night my mom and dad drilled into
[47:05] me and thoughts at me that you don't
[47:08] tell a young woman I couldn't tell a
[47:09] young woman that I loved her until I was
[47:11] ready to put a ring on her finger until
[47:12] I was ready
[47:14] to marry her and spend the rest of my
[47:16] life with her there was no mentioning
[47:18] that I loved her that wasn't on the
[47:21] table in any way and
[47:25] that's one of those where if you looked
[47:28] at it from this Greek perspective of
[47:29] having these multiple words for it you
[47:32] could very clearly go well yeah I
[47:34] love pizza I use this word to go for
[47:37] pizzas this is what I enjoy eating great
[47:39] that makes sense now I don't think that
[47:42] you want to go marry Pizza it's very
[47:44] very simple but so when we're looking at
[47:46] First Corinthians 13 when it's using the
[47:49] word charity that is the Greek word
[47:51] agape and so this whole chapter is
[47:54] talking about agape love and so to be
[47:57] very clear as we go into this and talk
[47:59] about it we're not touching on the other
[48:01] three
[48:03] First Corinthians 13 is just about agape
[48:06] love it's about God's Own love that
[48:09] perfect selfless unconditional love
[48:13] brother Brandon said in the sermon
[48:15] Jehovah Jireh he said someone said to me
[48:17] not long ago said brother Branham now
[48:20] you know you was a good Baptist I said I
[48:22] still feel that but I've raised up a
[48:23] little higher he said well now look said
[48:25] Abraham believed God and was imputed to
[48:28] him for righteousness how much more
[48:30] could Abraham do but believe he said
[48:32] when we believe God
[48:34] we receive the Holy Spirit I said how
[48:37] different from Saint Paul Saint Paul
[48:38] said in Acts 19 have you received the
[48:40] Holy Ghost since you believed not when
[48:42] you believed since he said well Abraham
[48:45] believed God that's all he could do I
[48:47] said true but then God give him the
[48:49] order of circumcision as a confirmation
[48:51] that he had received his faith and if he
[48:53] had never circumcised you yet by the
[48:56] Holy Ghost he hasn't received your faith
[48:58] yet that's right that is the
[49:00] circumcision of the heart and spirit God
[49:02] gives the Holy Ghost as a confirmation
[49:04] he has received your faith now if you
[49:06] stop believing and scrambling around and
[49:08] just believe God God will circumcise
[49:10] that heart and that cuts off all
[49:11] unbelief circumcise the world and all
[49:14] unbelief away from you and then you
[49:16] stand the word alone Jesus said if he
[49:18] invited me in my word in you then ask
[49:20] what you will it'll be given to you
[49:22] that's what's the matter with the church
[49:23] today it's under emotion it's under
[49:25] education it's under Creed no wonder
[49:27] it's smothered down sea so we need a
[49:29] circumcision to cut the whole thing away
[49:31] come back to God in his word and believe
[49:33] it the way it's wrote there and don't
[49:36] argue with it just stay with it God made
[49:38] a promise God keeps his promise he can't
[49:40] do nothing else but keep his promise and
[49:43] remain God
[49:44] let's see turn to Deuteronomy chapter
[49:46] 30.
[49:48] and verse 5 will start at
[49:52] and at first glance I'm sure this seems
[49:54] really weird okay he was talking about
[49:55] agape love and now suddenly we're on
[49:57] circumcision where where are we going
[49:58] with this
[49:59] so we go in Deuteronomy chapter 30 and
[50:02] it's starting at verse 5 it says and the
[50:04] Lord thy God will bring thee into land
[50:06] which thy fathers possessed and thou
[50:08] shalt possess it and he will do the good
[50:10] and multiply thee above thy fathers and
[50:13] the Lord thy God will circumcise thine
[50:15] heart and the Heart of thy seed to love
[50:18] the Lord thy God with all thine heart
[50:19] and with all thy soul that thou mayest
[50:21] live and the Lord thy God will put these
[50:24] curses upon thine enemies and on them
[50:26] that hate thee which persecuted thee and
[50:28] thou shalt return and obey the voice of
[50:29] the Lord and do all his Commandments
[50:31] which I command thee this day
[50:33] let's go back up to verse 6 again and
[50:35] the Lord thy God will circumcise thy
[50:37] heart and the Heart of thy seed
[50:39] to love the Lord thy God with all thine
[50:42] heart so in order to love the Lord thy
[50:45] God there has to be a circumcision there
[50:47] has to be a cutting away we can't love
[50:49] God
[50:50] until this something has been removed
[50:53] they're tied right together this is
[50:55] these are commas that are in here this
[50:57] is all carried together as one sentence
[50:59] that in order for you to love the Lord
[51:02] thy God with all thine heart and with
[51:05] all thy soul
[51:07] the Lord thy God has to circumcise thine
[51:09] heart which means he has to cut
[51:11] something away he has to begin to clear
[51:12] away so that you can love me correctly
[51:17] so as you know circumcision we know as a
[51:20] type of the Holy Ghost but the random
[51:21] laid that out very clearly and so the
[51:23] Holy Ghost is required to love the Lord
[51:25] with all our heart there has to be a
[51:28] cutting away of the excess and as God
[51:30] teaches us how to love more and more
[51:32] will be removed as we surrender and he
[51:35] teaches a little bit more there'll be a
[51:36] little more cutting away a little bit
[51:38] more cutting away so that we can love
[51:39] him the way that we're supposed to
[51:43] now as we go into
[51:45] First Corinthians 13 and we're going to
[51:47] be taking this piece by piece and we'll
[51:49] starting at verse 4
[51:56] charity suffereth long
[52:00] to change that into Modern English love
[52:02] is patient
[52:04] now patient
[52:07] just the definition of patient I can
[52:09] probably spend the whole sermon on just
[52:10] this but patient means able to accept or
[52:13] tolerate delays problems or suffering
[52:17] without becoming annoyed or anxious
[52:21] we could park here for a while
[52:24] without becoming annoyed or anxious
[52:29] I'll be quick to say I don't measure up
[52:32] all the time
[52:33] to say love is patient which means I can
[52:36] accept the delays the problems or the
[52:38] suffering
[52:40] without being anxious or annoyed
[52:45] we live in a world that's full of
[52:47] anxiety we live in a world where
[52:48] everyone is anxious about something or
[52:51] upset about something or upset about
[52:52] what's going on the very first thing as
[52:55] Paul's writing about it and talking
[52:57] about love he says
[52:59] charity suffers long love is patient
[53:01] first one he lists before we get into
[53:05] anything else it's you have to be able
[53:07] to take what sent it you without
[53:10] being anxious without being annoyed
[53:13] without being upset
[53:15] Romans chapter 8 verse 18 says for I
[53:17] reckon that the sufferings of this
[53:19] present time are not worthy to be
[53:21] compared with the glory which shall be
[53:23] revealed in US
[53:25] we're able to take the sufferings
[53:27] without the anxiety that that cripples
[53:31] the world the world always gets upset
[53:33] when they're going through a hard time
[53:35] when money starts to get a little bit
[53:36] tight when they've got some sort of
[53:38] sickness when they've got some sort of
[53:39] issue that's risen up
[53:41] they're immediately going to get anxious
[53:43] and worried and concerned but yet the
[53:45] first thing that Paul writes goes
[53:48] if you have love if you have Agape
[53:51] perfect love you're not anxious
[53:55] you're not annoyed you're not upset
[54:00] you're able to maintain that calm and
[54:02] peace through it all
[54:05] brother Brandon said in the sermon the
[54:07] seed does not air with the shock he says
[54:09] how will you know how will the world
[54:11] know that you love Jesus when we love
[54:14] one another
[54:15] that's how the world see God sees your
[54:17] faith the world sees your action love
[54:19] one another now be kind one to another
[54:21] talk with one another be patient with
[54:24] one another
[54:26] so back First Corinthians chapter 13
[54:28] verse 4 the next one is
[54:31] and is kind
[54:33] so love is kind kind is having or
[54:37] showing a friendly generous and
[54:39] considerate nature
[54:42] so first off we have
[54:44] peace we don't get upset and annoyed by
[54:46] what's going on next we're kind we're
[54:49] we're thinking about those around us
[54:50] we're wanting to treat them well and
[54:53] sometimes that means giving correction
[54:55] in kindness giving correction In Love
[54:59] sometimes it's telling them the truth
[55:00] and love is part of being kind being
[55:03] kind doesn't mean we're always trying to
[55:05] protect everyone's feelings
[55:07] being kind is thinking of what's best
[55:09] for them
[55:10] treating those around us with what is
[55:13] best for them at that time
[55:16] next in
[55:18] verse 4 it says charityth envieth not
[55:22] so love does not envy
[55:25] Envy is a feeling of discontented or
[55:27] resentful longing aroused by someone
[55:29] else's possessions qualities or
[55:32] blessings
[55:35] love doesn't have the desire to have
[55:37] what someone else has to to wear oh man
[55:40] I just wish I could
[55:42] sing as good as this brother or sister
[55:44] or that I could play the instruments as
[55:46] well or that I could preach as well as
[55:48] this person or that I could do this or
[55:50] that I could do that and this might be
[55:53] something that is in one way good to be
[55:56] desirous of
[55:57] you know we're not going hey I wish I
[55:59] had that much money I wish I had that
[56:01] much object you know these objects or
[56:02] physical things going I just wish that I
[56:05] could sing like that to worship God
[56:07] I wish I had a voice like that
[56:11] but then we have to remind ourselves God
[56:13] didn't say you had to sing well
[56:15] he said A Joyful Noise so that means if
[56:17] you don't sing well it's still okay
[56:19] he didn't say we had to be able to play
[56:21] every single instrument out there he
[56:23] didn't say that we had to be able to do
[56:25] this or do that I don't have to be able
[56:27] to be the fire and brimstone preacher
[56:30] like brother Josh or like someone else
[56:32] that's not my calling and that's okay
[56:34] I don't have to be like this one or like
[56:36] that one
[56:38] other people don't have to try to be
[56:40] like me God's made each one of us and so
[56:42] God tells us if you have this perfect
[56:45] love you're not envious you're not
[56:47] trying to be what you're not you're not
[56:50] trying to get what's not yours you're
[56:53] comfortable and you're satisfied with
[56:56] where God has placed you and what he's
[56:58] doing with you
[57:00] brother Brandon said in the sermon that
[57:02] God had explained he says and no matter
[57:04] what we do how many miracles we can
[57:06] perform how many mountains we can move
[57:08] or whatever it is until we can come to a
[57:11] place that we love not make belief but
[57:13] we love one another when we love every
[57:15] brother no matter what church he belongs
[57:17] to we love him not just pretend we do
[57:20] because we know it's a religious idea
[57:22] we're supposed to do it but because we
[57:24] do it we love one another then
[57:26] long-suffering bearing with one another
[57:29] and I believe in Colossians 3 about 9
[57:31] somewhere along there I might have might
[57:34] be wrong in the scripture but it said
[57:35] after we become Christians we should not
[57:36] envy see we can't have faith when we're
[57:38] trying to pay respects and honor to one
[57:40] another see we can't do that we can't
[57:42] have faith we've got to honor God see
[57:44] honor him believe in in my brother sure
[57:48] is love but the respects and dignity
[57:50] goes to God
[57:51] but have faith and confidence in one
[57:53] another and don't lie to another see
[57:55] don't lie to one another if I tell you
[57:57] this morning I love you I must mean that
[57:59] if it doesn't I'm a hypocrite that's
[58:01] exactly
[58:03] next the scripture tells us that charity
[58:05] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
[58:08] so love is not prideful
[58:11] pride is a feeling of deep pleasure or
[58:13] satisfaction that is derived from one's
[58:15] own achievements
[58:17] the achievement of those with whom one
[58:18] is closely associated or from qualities
[58:21] or possessions that are widely admired
[58:26] we're not supposed to be proud of
[58:29] what we have or what we can do or any of
[58:33] those kind of things because
[58:35] we all know that it's just given to us
[58:37] by God it's what's entrusted to us just
[58:39] like I'm not envying someone for the
[58:41] gift they have I shouldn't be proud
[58:43] because of the gift that I have
[58:45] brother Josh has a calling as an
[58:47] evangelist he travels around and
[58:48] preaches
[58:50] I shouldn't envy that and want to go
[58:53] like he does
[58:54] and he shouldn't be taking pride in the
[58:56] fact that hey I get to go to all these
[58:58] places and they invite me to preach here
[59:00] and preach there sorry brother Josh
[59:02] you're getting picked on tonight
[59:05] we have different types of callings and
[59:07] we should both be comfortable and happy
[59:09] in the callings that we're in
[59:12] I was called to be in this type of
[59:15] ministry I which fit well with then
[59:18] having the role of the deacon where my
[59:20] heart's at home this is where I want to
[59:22] be I'm not interested in traveling a
[59:23] whole lot
[59:24] brother Josh doesn't fit the role of the
[59:27] deacon because that's not where his
[59:28] heart is his heart is to go out and
[59:31] evangelize because that's the calling on
[59:32] his life
[59:34] this is the way God has made each one of
[59:36] us to work with in the body to each have
[59:39] their part that they play and work with
[59:42] it and so it's not that I'm envying what
[59:44] he has it's not that I'm being prideful
[59:47] of what I have
[59:49] it's that we just love each other as
[59:50] brothers and we support each other and
[59:52] we're there for each other the way that
[59:54] we're supposed to
[59:57] Proverbs chapter 29 and verse 23 it says
[1:00:00] a man's Pride shall bring him low but
[1:00:02] honor shall uphold the humble in spirit
[1:00:08] as we go into verse 5 in First
[1:00:11] Corinthians 13 it says it doth not
[1:00:14] behave itself unseemly
[1:00:19] love is in order or love is modest is
[1:00:21] another way to say it unseemly is
[1:00:23] behavior or action that is not proper or
[1:00:26] appropriate
[1:00:28] so when we have this love we are going
[1:00:30] to act in the correct manner we're going
[1:00:32] to carry ourselves in the right manner
[1:00:34] when the way that we present ourselves
[1:00:36] not just physically although it does
[1:00:38] carry into that if I'm manifesting this
[1:00:41] and I'm working in the modest manner
[1:00:43] it's going to reflect in my clothing
[1:00:45] it's going to reflect in the way that I
[1:00:47] act but it's also going to affect in my
[1:00:48] attitude it's going to affect it's going
[1:00:50] to manifest itself in the way that I
[1:00:53] speak to others it's going to be
[1:00:54] manifest itself in the way that I
[1:00:56] interact with my brothers and sisters
[1:00:58] it's gonna interact it's going to be in
[1:00:59] the way that I interact with the world
[1:01:01] when I'm out on the job side and the way
[1:01:03] that I carry myself
[1:01:04] I'm going to be carrying myself with a
[1:01:07] matter with a some decorum and being in
[1:01:10] an order in a certain way because this
[1:01:13] is what we've been called for
[1:01:15] we have been called to be the the
[1:01:18] diplomats and the emissaries here on
[1:01:20] Earth for a kingdom that's not on this
[1:01:22] Earth and so we are carrying ourselves
[1:01:24] as representatives of that Kingdom we
[1:01:27] have to carry ourselves in order
[1:01:31] you know some of the biggest scandals
[1:01:32] that you'll occasionally read of in the
[1:01:34] newspaper is when someone from another
[1:01:35] country is here in the U.S or someone
[1:01:38] from the US is in another country and
[1:01:40] they behave themselves in an improper
[1:01:43] Manner and they end up getting arrested
[1:01:46] or they end up being splashed all over
[1:01:48] the tabloids or whatever because they
[1:01:51] did not model a behavior that would
[1:01:53] actually make their country look good
[1:01:56] they came off and they were not a good
[1:01:59] Emissary they were not a good role model
[1:02:01] for that country to go oh yeah I want to
[1:02:03] go visit England now because of how they
[1:02:06] carried themselves or France or Belgium
[1:02:08] or take your pick
[1:02:10] or them saying I want to go visit the
[1:02:12] U.S because of how good the U.S tourists
[1:02:14] are U.S tourists have some of the worst
[1:02:16] reputations in the world
[1:02:18] they're not good at setting an example
[1:02:21] they are not good at carrying themselves
[1:02:24] in order
[1:02:26] Ephesians chapter 4
[1:02:30] verse 1 says I therefore the prisoner of
[1:02:33] the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy
[1:02:35] of the vocation wherewith you are called
[1:02:37] with all lowliness and meekness with
[1:02:40] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[1:02:42] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:02:45] the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:02:49] we're called to
[1:02:50] act a certain way we're called to
[1:02:52] present ourselves in a certain way and
[1:02:54] as
[1:02:55] the love of God begins to manifest in us
[1:02:58] more and more some of those attitudes
[1:03:01] and some of those desires and some of
[1:03:03] those things begin to be cut away and
[1:03:05] pushed off because now we're carrying
[1:03:08] ourselves because we have a certain
[1:03:10] office
[1:03:11] I am a representative of the Kingdom
[1:03:15] of Jesus Christ and so as such I have to
[1:03:18] act a certain way I have to talk a
[1:03:20] certain way because everything I do
[1:03:22] reflects back on my Lord
[1:03:33] next it says that it's seeketh not her
[1:03:36] own
[1:03:38] love does not seek after its own
[1:03:40] pleasure love is selfless this is where
[1:03:43] we're talking about we're talking about
[1:03:44] agape love we're talking about that
[1:03:46] perfect Selfless Love and so Paul lays
[1:03:49] it out very clear just says
[1:03:50] it doesn't seek after its own desires
[1:03:52] after its own wants it's selfless it's
[1:03:55] only thinking about about those around
[1:03:57] it
[1:03:58] John Wesley made the the following
[1:04:00] comments on Selfless Love he said it's
[1:04:03] seeketh not her own ease pleasure honor
[1:04:06] or temporal Advantage nay sometimes the
[1:04:08] lover of mankind seeketh not in some
[1:04:10] sense even his own spiritual Advantage
[1:04:13] it does not think of himself so long as
[1:04:15] Zeal for the glory of God and The Souls
[1:04:18] of men swallows him up
[1:04:21] brother random sit in the sermon that
[1:04:23] day on Calvary he said
[1:04:25] Jesus said and spoke of it let me just
[1:04:27] give you a few quotations on it listen
[1:04:28] close don't miss it Jesus said it that
[1:04:31] day he would separate the people like
[1:04:32] the sheep and the goats and he would say
[1:04:34] to the goat stand on the left side into
[1:04:36] the Sheep stand on the right and he said
[1:04:38] to the goats depart for me because I was
[1:04:40] hungry and you didn't feed me I was in
[1:04:42] prison and you did not visit me I was
[1:04:44] naked and you clothed me not I was
[1:04:46] thirsty and you gave me no drink I was
[1:04:47] sick and you didn't visit me so depart
[1:04:49] from me and on the sheep he said I was
[1:04:52] hungry and you fed me I was naked and
[1:04:54] you give me clothing I was sick and you
[1:04:55] ministered to me and notice don't fail
[1:04:57] to get this church keep this in your
[1:04:59] heart forever it was so unconsciously
[1:05:01] done the people didn't do it for line of
[1:05:04] duty a man that gives you something
[1:05:05] another because he ought to do it a man
[1:05:07] that feeds you because he ought to do it
[1:05:09] he's got a selfish idea it should be
[1:05:12] your very life your very action it was
[1:05:15] so surprising to these sheep that they
[1:05:16] said Lord when were you hungry and we
[1:05:20] when were you naked and we give you
[1:05:23] clothes when were you thirsty and we
[1:05:24] give you drink when were you sick and we
[1:05:26] ministered to you it was so
[1:05:28] automatically out of love just your life
[1:05:31] lived in them God let the people see
[1:05:33] what Calvary did for us so automatically
[1:05:35] when were you Lord we never knew that
[1:05:38] Look what Jesus turned and said in so
[1:05:40] much of you done unto these you did it
[1:05:42] unto me
[1:05:43] unselfish life not the second thought
[1:05:46] not to think about it but you are so
[1:05:49] dead to the things of this world and so
[1:05:51] in life in Christ and so walking on the
[1:05:53] highway that these things are just an
[1:05:55] automatic thing you just do it not
[1:05:58] saying well now the Lord would Lord
[1:05:59] would want me to do that it's not that
[1:06:01] you're just part of him his spirit is in
[1:06:04] you and you act the way he acted
[1:06:08] do you get it
[1:06:12] goes on and says that
[1:06:14] love charity is not easily provoked
[1:06:18] which means love does not anger easily
[1:06:21] now provoke is to stimulate or incite
[1:06:25] someone to do or feel something
[1:06:28] especially by arousing anger in them
[1:06:31] love is not easily provoked
[1:06:36] it doesn't say it's never provoked let's
[1:06:39] put that little caveat there it's not to
[1:06:40] say it's never that you can never be
[1:06:44] taken to the point where you finally
[1:06:45] react but it's not easy you don't have a
[1:06:48] hair Drinker temporary this isn't
[1:06:50] something that goes off at the drop of a
[1:06:53] hat
[1:06:54] it ties into that patience it ties into
[1:06:57] the fact that you can keep taking it and
[1:07:01] you don't get annoyed
[1:07:03] annoyance leads to anger
[1:07:06] if you don't get annoyed then the anger
[1:07:08] is going to be far away it's going to
[1:07:09] take a long time to get there
[1:07:11] so when you're patient
[1:07:14] the not angering easily goes hand in
[1:07:16] hand it goes right with it
[1:07:21] yet thinketh no evil
[1:07:26] pretty straightforward love doesn't
[1:07:28] think evil thoughts
[1:07:30] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:07:32] things are of good report
[1:07:35] if there be any virtue if there be any
[1:07:38] praise think on these things
[1:07:41] when we have that perfect love this is
[1:07:43] where our mind stays we stay on the
[1:07:46] things of God we stay on the things that
[1:07:48] are holy and righteous and upright so
[1:07:51] we're not thinking about the evil things
[1:07:55] it says
[1:07:57] going into verse six rejoiceth not an
[1:07:59] iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
[1:08:03] so love doesn't rejoice in evil
[1:08:06] we rejoice in the things that are good
[1:08:08] we rejoice in the things that are
[1:08:09] upright we don't look at the things that
[1:08:11] are going on around us and when
[1:08:13] something bad happens
[1:08:15] think that it's funny or think that it's
[1:08:16] amusing or think that it's whatever
[1:08:19] think that it's something that's
[1:08:20] entertaining
[1:08:22] the same place it goes back to we don't
[1:08:25] think about the evil things well if I'm
[1:08:28] being entertained by the evil then I'm
[1:08:31] thinking about the evil if I'm allowing
[1:08:33] myself to rejoice in the evil then
[1:08:35] obviously I'm thinking about it but if
[1:08:37] I'm keeping myself from thinking about
[1:08:38] the evil and I'm thinking about the good
[1:08:41] things I'm not going to be rejoicing in
[1:08:43] the evil
[1:08:45] first Peter
[1:08:47] chapter 4 starting at verse 7 it says
[1:08:51] but the end of all things is at hand be
[1:08:53] therefore sober and watch unto prayer
[1:08:57] and above all things have fervent
[1:08:58] charity among yourselves for charity
[1:09:00] shall cover the multitude of sins
[1:09:04] use Hospitality one to another without
[1:09:06] grudging as every man hath received the
[1:09:09] gift
[1:09:09] even so Minister the same one to another
[1:09:12] as good stewards of the manifold grace
[1:09:14] of God if any man speak let him speak as
[1:09:17] the Oracles of God if any man Minister
[1:09:19] let them do it as of the ability which
[1:09:21] God giveth that God in all things may be
[1:09:23] glorified through Jesus Christ to whom
[1:09:25] be praise and Dominion forever and ever
[1:09:27] amen
[1:09:30] that verse 8 and above all things have
[1:09:32] fervent charity among yourselves for
[1:09:34] Charities shall cover the multitude of
[1:09:37] sins
[1:09:40] going into verse 7
[1:09:43] we've got a lot of things grouped
[1:09:44] together really fast beareth all things
[1:09:46] believeth all things hope with all
[1:09:49] things endureth all things
[1:09:52] beareth all things
[1:09:54] we take whatever is thrown at us
[1:09:57] with God's strength we're able to Bear
[1:10:00] it we're able to keep going we're able
[1:10:02] to keep pressing you're able to keep
[1:10:04] walking not because of my strength not
[1:10:08] because of your strength but because you
[1:10:11] have God strengthening you to keep
[1:10:13] pressing on to keep going forward
[1:10:16] believeth all things now that doesn't
[1:10:18] mean that we believe every single thing
[1:10:21] we read on the internet
[1:10:23] it doesn't mean we believe every
[1:10:24] conspiracy theory that's out there
[1:10:26] that's what not what he's describing
[1:10:28] when he says love believes all things
[1:10:32] perfect love believes the perfect word
[1:10:38] agape love leads you back to the perfect
[1:10:41] word and so we have that perfect faith
[1:10:43] in it to believe every word that's here
[1:10:47] we don't question it we don't have the
[1:10:49] doubt behind it we're able to believe
[1:10:51] what God said because the very love and
[1:10:54] life that's within us comes from God and
[1:10:57] so we are not going to doubt what he
[1:10:59] said
[1:11:01] love endures all things
[1:11:05] ties in with barith all things
[1:11:08] we can keep pressing forward we can keep
[1:11:10] enduring the trials that are sent to us
[1:11:13] because God's giving us the strength to
[1:11:15] do it God's giving us the perfect love
[1:11:18] to face it so that we're not getting
[1:11:20] upset we have the patience to go through
[1:11:23] the trial we have the patience to Bear
[1:11:25] the test to Bear the burden we have the
[1:11:28] patience to be able to endure
[1:11:31] I skipped one there hope with all things
[1:11:35] and then in the end it says charity
[1:11:38] never faileth
[1:11:40] so the charity this perfect agape love
[1:11:45] never fails
[1:11:47] this isn't going with the English word
[1:11:49] of yeah love never fails well which love
[1:11:51] let's be very this is the Agape perfect
[1:11:55] love of God never fails
[1:11:59] if I'm loving you with a different type
[1:12:01] of love it can fail I can come up short
[1:12:04] I can get angry I can get upset but when
[1:12:08] we're going with that perfect love that
[1:12:10] perfect love of God it cannot fail
[1:12:15] Galatians chapter six
[1:12:18] starting at verse 1.
[1:12:25] Brethren if a man be overtaken in Fault
[1:12:29] ye which are spiritual restore such a
[1:12:32] one in the spirit of meekness
[1:12:33] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:12:36] tempted
[1:12:37] burying one another's burdens and so
[1:12:40] fulfill the law of Christ
[1:12:42] for if a man think himself to be
[1:12:44] something when he is nothing he
[1:12:45] deceiveth himself
[1:12:47] but let every man prove his own work and
[1:12:49] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[1:12:51] alone and not in another
[1:12:57] bear one another's burdens yes
[1:13:00] love beareth all things
[1:13:03] and we come into as a body help one
[1:13:06] another to go they're going through a
[1:13:08] hard time they're going through a trial
[1:13:10] they're starting to to dip under the
[1:13:12] weight a little bit we can come in and
[1:13:15] lift them up in prayer we can come in
[1:13:17] and be there to talk to them to
[1:13:20] encourage them to love them to share
[1:13:22] that perfect love of God with each other
[1:13:25] to help bear that burden so they're not
[1:13:27] feeling alone yes God gives us the
[1:13:30] strength for each one but sometimes he
[1:13:32] sends that strength through our brothers
[1:13:33] and sisters
[1:13:34] sometimes he just sends it to you as
[1:13:36] you're reading the word or you're
[1:13:38] praying but sometimes it's a brother or
[1:13:40] sister that comes and talks to you sends
[1:13:42] you a text or gives you a call or stops
[1:13:45] fire for a surprise visit or whatever it
[1:13:48] might be
[1:13:49] that brother or sister that maybe has
[1:13:50] been there before they've dealt with the
[1:13:52] same kind of issue and they're able to
[1:13:53] come in and talk to you about this is
[1:13:55] how God got me through I'm going to help
[1:13:57] you bear this burden because I've been
[1:14:00] there I've done it and even if I haven't
[1:14:02] been there I still love you and I'm here
[1:14:05] for you to encourage you and stand by
[1:14:07] you in the midst of whatever trial
[1:14:09] you're facing
[1:14:12] brother banham said and the word became
[1:14:14] flesh
[1:14:16] he says what kind of people would it be
[1:14:18] this morning if this Branham Tabernacle
[1:14:20] this morning was so filled with the
[1:14:21] presence of God why when you didn't even
[1:14:24] use your own mind didn't even use your
[1:14:26] own thoughts didn't have no ultimony of
[1:14:30] your own but just to be led by the
[1:14:32] spirit
[1:14:33] and they that are the sons of God are
[1:14:35] led by the spirit of God and when the
[1:14:37] human element goes out and the spirit of
[1:14:40] God fills that vacancy where you empty
[1:14:42] yourself amen then will be when the
[1:14:44] church and its power of the resurrection
[1:14:46] of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps
[1:14:48] in his power in his thoughts in his
[1:14:51] being in his moving you see what I mean
[1:14:54] then your thoughts will become words and
[1:14:57] words will become material that's when
[1:14:59] the church is in its power I believe
[1:15:02] it's on the road that when the church
[1:15:04] will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy
[1:15:07] Spirit mankind sow away from their cells
[1:15:09] that they don't see themselves they
[1:15:11] don't have no but to serve God and their
[1:15:14] thoughts move on they refuse the things
[1:15:16] of the world they just move in the
[1:15:18] spirit live in the spirit move in the
[1:15:20] spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the
[1:15:23] law of Christ then the love of Christ in
[1:15:26] the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost
[1:15:28] that great wonderful church will go
[1:15:30] forth with power and deity because deity
[1:15:33] will be revealed in human beings by the
[1:15:35] Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought
[1:15:37] of their mind our thoughts run different
[1:15:40] a lot of times we walk up say how do you
[1:15:42] do brother and you don't meet it in your
[1:15:44] heart a lot of times we say I am this
[1:15:46] and that I'll do that you don't mean it
[1:15:48] in your heart see I don't mean it in my
[1:15:51] heart but when you can become so dead to
[1:15:54] the things of the world that Christ is
[1:15:55] first Christ is all then your entire
[1:15:58] makeup is of the spirit of Lord Jesus
[1:16:00] Christ he has full control that's when
[1:16:02] your thoughts will be clean your
[1:16:03] thoughts will be pure your heart your
[1:16:06] heart many people say well religion
[1:16:08] comes from your heart there is no mental
[1:16:10] facilities in that little being called
[1:16:12] heart you can't think with your heart
[1:16:13] the Bible said as a man thinketh in his
[1:16:16] heart so is it you can't think with your
[1:16:17] heart you can't because there's nothing
[1:16:19] mentally in there to think with Jesus
[1:16:20] wasn't speaking of the physical being he
[1:16:23] was speaking of the supernatural being
[1:16:28] right in the middle there when he talks
[1:16:30] about our thoughts run different a lot
[1:16:31] of times we walk up say how do you do
[1:16:33] brother and you don't mean it in your
[1:16:34] heart yeah how often do we do that we go
[1:16:37] up and we'll say hey how you doing today
[1:16:38] we don't want an answer
[1:16:40] we really don't want to know we just
[1:16:42] want you to go I'm good great I can keep
[1:16:44] on walking that's it you know how many
[1:16:46] times do we do that at work on the job
[1:16:48] side hey buddy how you doing today all I
[1:16:50] want to hear is good or great so I can
[1:16:52] keep walking
[1:16:53] I don't want an honest answer
[1:16:56] and on the flip side most of us if
[1:16:58] someone asks us that we don't want to
[1:17:01] give them the honest answer
[1:17:03] we would rather just say the good
[1:17:07] and that's it and we're done
[1:17:09] conversation is over we both feel like
[1:17:11] we've been nice to each other
[1:17:13] and we're moving on
[1:17:16] and yet brother Branham says
[1:17:19] that we have to mean it from the heart
[1:17:23] so when we're manifesting this agape
[1:17:25] love we're not we're not using this
[1:17:27] throwaway language that we're so used to
[1:17:30] I don't get to go up to
[1:17:32] brother John and just say
[1:17:35] how are you
[1:17:37] and not want an answer it's not the way
[1:17:40] it works if I ask the question I better
[1:17:42] be prepared
[1:17:45] because if I ask it I need to have some
[1:17:47] sincerity here to go I really want to
[1:17:50] know how are you
[1:17:53] I need to actually exactly like brother
[1:17:55] Wendler said I need to truly care about
[1:17:57] the person that I'm asking this to this
[1:18:00] isn't just something where I'm going
[1:18:01] well I want to be polite and so I'm just
[1:18:04] gonna say how you doing
[1:18:05] it's no I care about you because I have
[1:18:08] that perfect love where what's going on
[1:18:11] in your life matters
[1:18:14] is there something that you need to talk
[1:18:16] about is there something I can be
[1:18:18] praying about for you is there something
[1:18:20] that you need to share and maybe it's
[1:18:22] good you're on the Mountaintop and we're
[1:18:25] just going to praise the Lord for a
[1:18:26] minute about the blessings of God great
[1:18:29] we can do that too
[1:18:31] but I need to have that sincerity when I
[1:18:34] ask how are you doing
[1:18:36] that I'm ready for an answer
[1:18:39] and I'm ready to show that care based on
[1:18:41] whatever it is that you say
[1:18:43] whatever the situation is I'm ready to
[1:18:46] continue to show that love and that care
[1:18:52] charity never faileth
[1:18:55] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:18:57] shall fail away whether there be tongues
[1:18:59] they shall cease whether there be
[1:19:01] knowledge that shall vanish away
[1:19:03] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:19:06] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:19:08] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:19:11] done away
[1:19:12] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:19:14] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:19:16] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:19:18] childish things
[1:19:21] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:19:23] but then face to face now I know in part
[1:19:25] but then I shall know even as I also am
[1:19:28] known
[1:19:29] and now by the faith hope charity these
[1:19:32] three but the greatest greatest of these
[1:19:35] is Charity that agape love
[1:19:38] brother random said in the sermon
[1:19:40] getting in the spirit he said
[1:19:41] and that's what we've tried to do for
[1:19:43] two thousand years
[1:19:45] and Pentecostal people you're doing the
[1:19:47] same thing trying to pick him up by
[1:19:48] organization you'll never do it
[1:19:50] separating yourself from other brothers
[1:19:52] you've got to come back and we've got to
[1:19:54] be one I don't care if the man's wrong
[1:19:56] if he's wrong and sincere in his heart
[1:19:59] and you're right in your beliefs and
[1:20:01] you're wrong in acting the way you're
[1:20:03] acting I'd rather be in his place than
[1:20:05] yours that's right I'd rather be wrong
[1:20:07] in my Doctrine and right in my heart God
[1:20:10] will respect it more so if a man is
[1:20:13] wrong what of it help him he needs help
[1:20:15] love him if you can't love your enemy
[1:20:17] the same as you love those who love you
[1:20:18] you're no better off than the publicans
[1:20:20] that's right that's what the churches
[1:20:22] failed to get I hope you get it tonight
[1:20:24] I hope you see what I'm talking about
[1:20:25] it's back to love redeeming love all the
[1:20:29] other things are fine but we got to come
[1:20:31] back to fellowship with one another and
[1:20:33] people said I fight organization I do
[1:20:35] not I fight that system in there that's
[1:20:37] breaking up Brotherhood I've always done
[1:20:39] it and I always will do it that's right
[1:20:44] I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine and
[1:20:47] right in my heart
[1:20:48] God will respect it more
[1:20:52] our Prophet told us that this isn't me
[1:20:56] as a minister standing up here and going
[1:20:57] you know God's going to respect your
[1:21:00] heart more
[1:21:01] this was the prophet saying if he's off
[1:21:04] in his Doctrine but he's right in his
[1:21:06] heart
[1:21:07] he's in a better place than the person
[1:21:08] that has all the doctrine lined up
[1:21:11] so if we don't have every single one of
[1:21:14] the seals laid out in our mind if I
[1:21:17] don't understand every single Church age
[1:21:18] if I don't understand every single
[1:21:20] mystery in Daniel or all these things
[1:21:23] take your pick of which Mysteries we're
[1:21:24] talking about
[1:21:26] my heart's right
[1:21:29] that's what's God paying attention to
[1:21:31] that's what God's going to respect is
[1:21:33] whether our heart is right and we're
[1:21:35] manifesting that love now if we're if
[1:21:37] our heart's right we're trusting that
[1:21:39] that Holy Spirit is going to start
[1:21:41] teaching us
[1:21:42] the teacher the holy spirit is going to
[1:21:45] start revealing those things to us
[1:21:48] if my heart's right
[1:21:49] if I'm in that place where I'm supposed
[1:21:51] to
[1:21:52] all right but this that's why we talk
[1:21:55] about the fact that this isn't some
[1:21:57] knowledge that we come to where we're
[1:21:58] able to with my learning be able to
[1:22:01] piece everything together and make it
[1:22:02] all fit just right because that part is
[1:22:06] the less important
[1:22:09] our Prophet told us
[1:22:11] the heart is what matters Are We There
[1:22:14] is the heart right do we have the right
[1:22:16] attitude are we caring for those around
[1:22:18] us are we showing the love of God the
[1:22:20] way that we're supposed to
[1:22:22] if we're off in the doctrine but the
[1:22:24] heart's right God will take care of
[1:22:26] straightening out the doctrine
[1:22:28] God will take care of teaching us
[1:22:30] sending a faithful Minister into our
[1:22:33] life to help train us to help teach us
[1:22:35] to help get us to where we're supposed
[1:22:36] to be
[1:22:38] but the first and foremost is is our
[1:22:40] heart where it's supposed to be are we
[1:22:42] showing the love of God that we're
[1:22:43] supposed to
[1:22:46] brother Branham said in the sermon
[1:22:48] questions and answers in 1962. he says I
[1:22:51] didn't come to this church tonight
[1:22:53] legally I feel tired I've been nervous
[1:22:56] I'm upset I'm wondering about something
[1:22:59] that's out before me my heart's burning
[1:23:01] even as much till my heart's fluttering
[1:23:03] I got cramp pain right at this minute
[1:23:05] just shooting back and forth up and down
[1:23:07] through here weak nervous trembly
[1:23:11] catch a hold here and squeeze me got my
[1:23:13] toes squeezed up in my shoes I felt
[1:23:15] anything but to come down here
[1:23:18] why did I come then
[1:23:21] because I love God live or die I must
[1:23:24] stand for him it's not because I have to
[1:23:27] he wouldn't care about whether I did it
[1:23:29] or not if I'd Die go to heaven anyhow
[1:23:32] but I'm coming because I love him you
[1:23:34] serve God because you love him not
[1:23:36] because you got to do it because you
[1:23:39] love him enough
[1:23:42] brother during I know that you've felt
[1:23:44] that a few times where you're going as
[1:23:46] you're sitting here at church going I
[1:23:47] don't feel like being here
[1:23:49] I don't feel like getting up and getting
[1:23:51] dressed to go church I don't feel like
[1:23:54] getting in the car and having to fight
[1:23:57] through every step to get here
[1:24:00] but yet you're here
[1:24:03] and you can I know that your Testament
[1:24:04] would be the exact same as brother
[1:24:06] branners we go
[1:24:07] because I love God
[1:24:09] I want to be there because I love him I
[1:24:12] want to be in his presence because I
[1:24:15] love him no matter what this physical
[1:24:18] body is doing no matter what symptoms
[1:24:21] may be trying to tell me
[1:24:23] and there are going to be times when the
[1:24:25] symptoms are bad enough you can't make
[1:24:26] it we all understand there are times the
[1:24:29] body falls far enough you can't make it
[1:24:31] but the desire is still there just like
[1:24:33] brother random said it's about the heart
[1:24:35] if that desire is still there I want to
[1:24:37] be in church
[1:24:39] but I'm parked over the commode throwing
[1:24:41] up I can't leave this thing
[1:24:44] God understands he knows your heart is
[1:24:46] to be in church
[1:24:48] but you can't get there safely
[1:24:51] okay
[1:24:52] God's paying attention to the heart
[1:24:55] God's paying attention to the desire
[1:24:57] your desire is to be in his presence
[1:25:00] your desire is to be there
[1:25:03] brother random continues in this quote
[1:25:05] he says
[1:25:06] I'm not true to my wife because I'm
[1:25:08] afraid she'd divorce me I'm true to her
[1:25:10] because I love her there's no other
[1:25:12] woman in the world but her that's the
[1:25:14] reason I'm true to her now if I'd done a
[1:25:16] mistake and they thought I did something
[1:25:18] wrong come to her say meet a honey I
[1:25:20] didn't mean to do that she'd forgive me
[1:25:22] for it I know she would I'd forgive her
[1:25:24] I love her I'd forgive her she'd forgive
[1:25:26] me but I wouldn't do it for nothing I
[1:25:28] love her too much to do it it isn't
[1:25:30] because I didn't think she would forgive
[1:25:33] me it's the idea that I love her too
[1:25:35] much to do it in the first place and as
[1:25:37] long as I love her like that I'll never
[1:25:39] do it and if she loves me the way she's
[1:25:41] supposed to she won't either and you
[1:25:43] love the Lord with all your heart you
[1:25:45] don't have to worry about these things
[1:25:46] if you make a mistake you don't sin
[1:25:49] willfully you just done something wrong
[1:25:51] see you slipped back true you was up
[1:25:54] here in Fellowship you dropped back down
[1:25:55] in the must down here again
[1:25:57] but you love the Lord with all your
[1:25:59] heart
[1:26:00] if you were sick at home and you
[1:26:02] couldn't make it to church the desire
[1:26:04] was still there to be in church it
[1:26:07] wasn't you started celebrating yes I've
[1:26:09] got a stuffy nose I don't have to go to
[1:26:10] church I can stay home and
[1:26:13] watch TV or I can stay home and
[1:26:16] do this on my computer do this
[1:26:19] no it's the desires are I want to be
[1:26:22] there I want to press through but
[1:26:26] the sickness is bad enough I can't right
[1:26:28] now
[1:26:29] or like when covet was going around okay
[1:26:32] I don't want I'm doing my best to keep
[1:26:34] from getting anyone else sick so I'm
[1:26:36] gonna pass by this time to protect the
[1:26:38] others my desire is still to be there
[1:26:41] I'm still going to be streaming the
[1:26:43] service I'm still gonna be doing this or
[1:26:45] doing that
[1:26:46] because my desire is to be in church my
[1:26:50] desire is to be there to worship and to
[1:26:53] be with my brothers and sisters
[1:27:07] John chapter 19.
[1:27:10] it's a little bit of lengthy reading but
[1:27:12] I want to get through
[1:27:14] a decent amount of Varsity so we're
[1:27:16] going to start at verse one
[1:27:20] then pilate therefore took Jesus and
[1:27:22] scourged him
[1:27:24] and the soldiers plated a crown of
[1:27:26] thorns and put it on his head and they
[1:27:28] put on him a purple robe and said hail
[1:27:31] King of the Jews and they smote him with
[1:27:33] their hands
[1:27:34] pilot therefore went fourth again and
[1:27:36] saith unto him behold I bring him forth
[1:27:38] to you that you may know that I find no
[1:27:39] fault in him then came Jesus forth
[1:27:42] wearing the crown of thorns in the
[1:27:43] purple robe and pilate saith unto them
[1:27:46] behold the man when the chief priest
[1:27:48] there for and officers saw him they
[1:27:50] cried out saying crucify him crucify him
[1:27:53] pilate saith unto them taking him and
[1:27:56] crucify him
[1:27:57] for I find no fault in him the Jews
[1:28:00] answered him we have a lawn by our law
[1:28:01] he ought to die because he made himself
[1:28:03] the son of God
[1:28:05] when pilate therefore heard that saying
[1:28:06] he was the more afraid and went again
[1:28:09] into the Judgment Hall and saith unto
[1:28:10] Jesus whence art thou but Jesus gave him
[1:28:13] no answer
[1:28:14] then said pilate unto him speakest thou
[1:28:16] not unto me knowest thou not that I have
[1:28:18] power to crucify thee and have power to
[1:28:19] release thee
[1:28:21] Jesus answered thou could us have no
[1:28:23] power at all against me except it were
[1:28:25] given thee from above
[1:28:27] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[1:28:29] hath the greater sin and from
[1:28:30] thenceforth pilate sought to release him
[1:28:32] but the Jews cried out saying if thou
[1:28:35] let this man go Thou Art not Caesar's
[1:28:37] friend
[1:28:38] whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh
[1:28:41] against Caesar when pilate therefore
[1:28:43] heard that saying he brought Jesus forth
[1:28:45] and sat down in the Judgment scene in a
[1:28:47] place that is called the pavement but in
[1:28:49] the Hebrew gabata and it was the
[1:28:52] preparation of the Passover and about
[1:28:54] the sixth hour and he said unto the Jews
[1:28:56] behold your king but they cried out away
[1:28:59] with him away with him crucify him
[1:29:01] pilate saith unto him shall I crucify
[1:29:04] your king the chief priest answer and we
[1:29:06] have no King but Caesar then delivered
[1:29:09] he him therefore unto them to be
[1:29:10] crucified
[1:29:11] and they took Jesus and led him away and
[1:29:14] he bearing his cross went forth into a
[1:29:16] place called the place of a skull which
[1:29:19] is called in the Hebrew Golgotha
[1:29:22] where they crucified him and two others
[1:29:24] with him on either side one
[1:29:27] and Jesus in the midst and pilate wrote
[1:29:30] a title and put it on the cross and the
[1:29:31] writing was Jesus of Nazareth the king
[1:29:33] of the Jews
[1:29:34] this title then read many of the Jews
[1:29:36] for the place where Jesus was crucified
[1:29:38] was nigh to the city and it was written
[1:29:40] in Hebrew and Greek and Latin then said
[1:29:43] the chief Priests of the Jews the pilot
[1:29:45] right not the king of the Jews but that
[1:29:46] he said I am King of the Jews pilate
[1:29:49] answered what I have written I have
[1:29:50] written
[1:29:51] then the soldiers when they had
[1:29:53] crucified Jesus took his garments and
[1:29:55] made four parts to every Soldier apart
[1:29:57] and also his coat now the coat was out
[1:29:59] was without seem woven from the top
[1:30:01] throughout they said therefore amongst
[1:30:03] themselves let us not Rend it but cast
[1:30:05] lots for it who's it shall be that the
[1:30:07] scriptures might be fulfilled which
[1:30:09] saith they parted my raiment among them
[1:30:12] and for my vesture they did castlots
[1:30:14] these things therefore the soldiers did
[1:30:17] now they're stood by the cross of Jesus
[1:30:20] his mother and his mother's Sister Mary
[1:30:21] the wife of cleophus and Mary Magdalene
[1:30:24] when Jesus therefore saw his mother and
[1:30:27] disciples standing by whom he loved he
[1:30:28] saith unto his mother woman Behold thy
[1:30:31] son
[1:30:32] then saith he to the disciple Behold thy
[1:30:34] mother
[1:30:35] and from that hour that disciple took
[1:30:36] her into his own home
[1:30:38] after the this Jesus knowing that all
[1:30:40] things were now accomplished that the
[1:30:42] scripture might be fulfilled saith I
[1:30:44] thirst
[1:30:45] now there was a vessel full of vinegar
[1:30:46] and they filled a sponge with vinegar
[1:30:49] and put it upon hyssop and put it to his
[1:30:51] mouth
[1:30:52] when Jesus therefore had received the
[1:30:54] vinegar he said it is finished he bowed
[1:30:57] his head and gave up the ghost
[1:30:59] the Jews therefore because it was the
[1:31:01] preparation that the body should not
[1:31:03] remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day
[1:31:04] for the Sabbath day was in high day the
[1:31:07] sought pilot that the legs might be
[1:31:08] broken that they might be taken away
[1:31:10] then came the soldiers and break the
[1:31:12] legs of the first and of the other which
[1:31:14] was crucified with him but when they
[1:31:16] came to Jesus and saw that he was dead
[1:31:17] already they break not his legs but one
[1:31:20] of the soldiers with a spear pierced his
[1:31:22] side and forthwith came there out blood
[1:31:24] and water
[1:31:25] and he that saw it bear record and his
[1:31:27] record is true
[1:31:30] and he knoweth that he saith true that
[1:31:32] he might believe for these things were
[1:31:34] done the scripture might be fulfilled a
[1:31:36] bone of him shall not be broken and
[1:31:38] again another scripture saith they shall
[1:31:40] look on him who they pierced
[1:31:45] Jesus wasn't feeling love while he went
[1:31:48] through the crucifixion he didn't have
[1:31:50] the warm fuzzy feeling that the world
[1:31:53] tries to tell you is love
[1:31:55] he wasn't sitting there
[1:31:58] just enamored with how everything was
[1:32:01] going it
[1:32:03] Isn't Love isn't what is shown in a
[1:32:06] Hallmark movie or some other Romance
[1:32:09] movie novel take your pick
[1:32:12] the greatest example of love that we
[1:32:14] have
[1:32:15] is Jesus giving his all
[1:32:18] taking our punishment enduring whippings
[1:32:22] thorns and crucifixion so that we could
[1:32:26] be redeemed back to our original state
[1:32:29] love that was able to endure suffering
[1:32:31] pain and humiliation in order to be back
[1:32:36] with the chosen bride
[1:32:41] this isn't what when if I were to just
[1:32:44] walk outside and ask a person describe
[1:32:46] to me love this is probably not what
[1:32:48] they're going to describe
[1:32:50] this is probably not what they're going
[1:32:52] to point to
[1:32:53] but yet this was the greatest example of
[1:32:55] love that could we could ever have
[1:32:58] when we go through and we start running
[1:33:00] through the scriptures on
[1:33:03] love
[1:33:06] Charities suffereth long
[1:33:10] he suffered the torment
[1:33:12] he kept taking it without opening his
[1:33:15] mouth
[1:33:18] is kind and envieth not it vaunteth not
[1:33:21] itself it's not puffed up
[1:33:24] Jesus had the right
[1:33:26] to call himself the greatest he had the
[1:33:29] right to be in that position he should
[1:33:32] have been the one sitting on the
[1:33:33] Judgment seat over Pilate
[1:33:36] but yet he was willing to be fully
[1:33:38] humbled
[1:33:39] to go fully down to the place of a
[1:33:41] servant to be the sacrifice
[1:33:47] it rejoices not an iniquity but rejoices
[1:33:49] in the truth
[1:33:51] it beareth all things believeth all
[1:33:53] things hope with all things endureth all
[1:33:55] things
[1:33:58] everything that's described can be
[1:34:00] attributed to Jesus Christ there's
[1:34:03] nothing there that you would say well
[1:34:04] Jesus didn't do that
[1:34:06] he didn't do that no everything that's
[1:34:09] listed there as Paul goes through and
[1:34:11] describes the perfect agape love as he
[1:34:14] goes through and describes God's Own
[1:34:16] love
[1:34:17] Jesus Christ was the example he was the
[1:34:21] one that lived it out so it's not just
[1:34:22] this is a list of what you should be
[1:34:24] able to do no one's ever done it before
[1:34:26] but this is what the list would be of
[1:34:29] what perfect love is
[1:34:30] no this is the man on Earth that did it
[1:34:34] this is the man that lived it out that
[1:34:37] set the model for every one of us of we
[1:34:41] call ourselves Christians which is to be
[1:34:42] christ-like
[1:34:44] which means we're supposed to be
[1:34:46] manifesting the same thing as Christ
[1:34:48] we're manifesting that Same Love
[1:34:51] we're willing to sacrifice to give it
[1:34:54] all
[1:34:55] we're not going on our own desires we're
[1:34:57] not going on our own wants we're not
[1:34:59] going on
[1:35:00] what is best for us
[1:35:04] you couldn't say that what was best for
[1:35:07] Jesus in the human form was to be
[1:35:10] crucified
[1:35:11] you can't say that was the best choice
[1:35:12] for him personally
[1:35:15] but he was willing to give up all of his
[1:35:18] best choices
[1:35:20] because he was willing to love so
[1:35:22] perfectly and so completely to be the
[1:35:24] sacrifice and give up everything
[1:35:28] for his bride
[1:35:33] everything for his bride
[1:35:36] we as Christians
[1:35:38] looking at that in the way that we love
[1:35:40] the world
[1:35:41] for a lot of us married the way that we
[1:35:43] love our spouse
[1:35:45] are we able to sacrifice that completely
[1:35:47] are we able to give everything that
[1:35:49] completely
[1:35:52] for our sweetheart
[1:35:57] in the marriage of the Lamb
[1:36:01] brother random tells a story
[1:36:08] preached in 1962 he says let me tell you
[1:36:10] a little something that happened
[1:36:13] I'm a missionary as you know do
[1:36:15] Evangelistic missionary work and about
[1:36:16] seven times overseas around the world
[1:36:19] here not long ago in the city of Rome
[1:36:21] Rome is a great City for art and they
[1:36:23] had a school of art there and several of
[1:36:25] our American young folk go over there
[1:36:27] every year to take a year or two's
[1:36:28] training and art to learn to paint
[1:36:30] pictures
[1:36:31] there was a group of young Americans
[1:36:32] came over here a few years ago as the
[1:36:34] story was told me and when they get over
[1:36:36] there they just go Hog Wild when they're
[1:36:38] in Rome they do as Rome does they get
[1:36:40] out and drink and strip themselves and
[1:36:42] everything else and carry on both boys
[1:36:44] and girls
[1:36:45] and there was a certain School
[1:36:48] and in this school this group of young
[1:36:50] Americans come over and every one of
[1:36:52] them almost did the same thing but one
[1:36:54] certain little girl she wouldn't
[1:36:55] tolerate it at all she stayed in at
[1:36:58] night time she read while they were all
[1:37:00] out drinking daytime she worked study
[1:37:02] well she was the laughing stock of the
[1:37:04] whole school and she kept herself like a
[1:37:07] lady conducted herself like a lady
[1:37:08] although there were young Roman boys and
[1:37:10] everything around trying to get her to
[1:37:12] go out she refused it no sir she stayed
[1:37:14] right with her lessons learning to draw
[1:37:15] and to paint rather and she stayed with
[1:37:17] it
[1:37:18] finally an old custodian at the place
[1:37:20] kept watching her seeing she was so much
[1:37:22] different although he was a Roman
[1:37:24] Catholic kept watching her how she
[1:37:25] conducted herself one evening the young
[1:37:28] girl in the park where the studio was or
[1:37:30] the place where they had the school she
[1:37:31] walked out upon the campus and went up
[1:37:32] towards the top of the hill and the sun
[1:37:34] was setting
[1:37:36] and she was standing up there with her
[1:37:38] pretty clean face and her hair hanging
[1:37:39] down looking across that way toward the
[1:37:42] setting of the Sun
[1:37:44] the old custadian custodian was raking
[1:37:46] down there in the yard he kept watching
[1:37:47] the girl as he raped something just kept
[1:37:50] telling him go talk to her
[1:37:52] so he laid his rake down took off his
[1:37:53] old slouch hat walked up where the young
[1:37:55] lady was cleared his throat she turned
[1:37:57] around he said pardon me Miss she said
[1:38:00] yes certainly and he noticed she had
[1:38:02] been crying
[1:38:03] all the rest was out on a big spree for
[1:38:05] the night he said Madam I hope you
[1:38:07] understand me in the right way that I'm
[1:38:09] just going to speak to you said you've
[1:38:11] been here for most over two years now
[1:38:13] two years now I've noticed the group
[1:38:14] that you come with continually they're
[1:38:15] out on parties and coming in at all
[1:38:17] times of the night drunk close half off
[1:38:19] of them and everything but I noticed
[1:38:21] that you don't attend such parties I
[1:38:23] noticed that seemingly that you're
[1:38:24] always looking across the sea of an
[1:38:25] evening you walk up here and stand each
[1:38:27] evening and watch the Sun go down
[1:38:29] what causes that said I'm an old man and
[1:38:31] I'm curious of knowing what causes this
[1:38:33] difference between you and the others
[1:38:36] she said yes sir sir I'm looking towards
[1:38:39] home when the Sun is setting
[1:38:41] she said across beyond that sun Yonder
[1:38:43] is my homeland
[1:38:44] she said in that land there's a certain
[1:38:46] State and in that certain State there's
[1:38:48] a certain City
[1:38:50] in that certain city is a certain house
[1:38:52] and in that house is a certain boy said
[1:38:54] he too is an artist
[1:38:55] when I left to come over here I pledge
[1:38:57] my love to him we're engaged to one
[1:38:59] another
[1:39:00] and she said no matter what any of the
[1:39:02] rest of them does that has nothing to do
[1:39:03] with me she said I promise to live true
[1:39:06] and right she said I'm longing for the
[1:39:08] day when I feel myself on the top of the
[1:39:10] wings of the big planes that'll take me
[1:39:11] across the sea set me down at the
[1:39:13] airport where he'll meet me he's
[1:39:15] building a home and we'll live together
[1:39:17] in that land
[1:39:18] that's the reason I act the way I do I'm
[1:39:20] true to the promise that I made a boy
[1:39:22] and he's true to the promise that he
[1:39:23] makes me
[1:39:24] said I hear from him now and then and I
[1:39:26] write to him and said corresponding with
[1:39:28] one another we're still holding our vows
[1:39:31] waiting for the day we meet
[1:39:33] oh how that would do for a real question
[1:39:35] Christian to get away from the things of
[1:39:37] the world and someday you talk about
[1:39:39] coming to the port on the wings of a
[1:39:41] dove he's coming for a bride one that
[1:39:43] don't fool with the world or the things
[1:39:44] of the world she's washed in the blood
[1:39:46] of the Lamb she's pledged her love to
[1:39:48] him only the love of the world is gone
[1:39:51] and dead to her the marriage of the Lamb
[1:39:53] has come and his bride hath made herself
[1:39:55] ready
[1:40:02] charity thinketh no evil we rejoiceth
[1:40:06] not an iniquity but rejoices in the
[1:40:08] truth
[1:40:11] she's not wrapped up in the things of
[1:40:13] the world she's not wrapped up in the
[1:40:14] desires of the world because her desires
[1:40:16] is for the one she's pledged to her
[1:40:19] desires is for the Savior that we've
[1:40:21] pledged ourselves to so we're not
[1:40:23] looking at the things of the world we're
[1:40:24] not looking at
[1:40:26] all the distractions all the Sparkles
[1:40:28] all the parties all
[1:40:30] the events that the world would want to
[1:40:34] try to draw you away to when Rana tried
[1:40:36] to pull you away to and and get you to
[1:40:39] give up that vow
[1:40:41] but our vow has been made
[1:40:44] to the one
[1:40:46] and we're just looking towards that day
[1:40:48] we're looking towards the day when we
[1:40:49] get to be back together once more
[1:40:57] Deuteronomy that we read earlier it said
[1:40:59] in the Lord thy God will circumcise thy
[1:41:00] heart and the Heart of thy seed to love
[1:41:03] the Lord thy God with all thine heart
[1:41:04] with all thy soul that thou mayest live
[1:41:08] Ezekiel chapter 36 starting at verse 25
[1:41:11] says then will I sprinkle clean water
[1:41:13] upon you and you shall be clean
[1:41:16] from all your filthiness and from all
[1:41:18] your Idols will I cleanse you a new
[1:41:20] heart also will I give you in a new
[1:41:21] spirit will I put within you and I will
[1:41:24] take away the Stony heart out of your
[1:41:25] flesh and I will give you in heart of
[1:41:27] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:41:29] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:41:31] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:41:34] them
[1:41:36] first Peter 4 and verse 8 and above all
[1:41:39] things have fervent charity among
[1:41:40] yourselves for charity shall cover the
[1:41:43] multitude of sins
[1:41:56] brother Brandon said in the sermon it
[1:41:58] wasn't so from the beginning he said
[1:41:59] friends the whole world is dying for
[1:42:01] love
[1:42:02] that's one of the greatest things that
[1:42:04] we leave out of our Pentecostal
[1:42:05] blessings too much of it a love that
[1:42:07] mixes it together the mortar that makes
[1:42:08] gifts and all the things of God operate
[1:42:10] perfectly as love one for the other
[1:42:13] this will all men know that you're my
[1:42:15] disciples
[1:42:18] Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12 put on
[1:42:21] therefore is the elect of God holy and
[1:42:23] beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[1:42:27] humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:42:29] long-suffering forbearing one another
[1:42:31] and forgiving one another If any man
[1:42:34] have a quarrel against any even as
[1:42:35] Christ forgave you so also do ye and
[1:42:39] above all these things put on charity
[1:42:40] which is the bond of perfectness
[1:42:43] and let the peace of God rule in your
[1:42:45] hearts to the which also you are called
[1:42:47] in one body and be thankful
[1:42:51] First Timothy chapter 1 and verse 5. now
[1:42:54] the end of the Commandment is Charity
[1:42:56] out of a pure heart
[1:42:57] and of a good conscience and of faith
[1:43:00] unfeigned
[1:43:03] and First Care First Corinthians chapter
[1:43:05] 13 ended with the verse and now Abide a
[1:43:08] faith hope charity these three
[1:43:11] but the greatest of these is charity
[1:43:14] as the musicians go ahead and come
[1:43:24] in 1957 Hebrews chapter 2
[1:43:29] brother Branham says sucker means to
[1:43:31] sympathize
[1:43:33] that's the reason he becomes this that
[1:43:34] he might be sympathetic with you who are
[1:43:37] who have your ups and downs and your
[1:43:39] little ins and outs and your Temptations
[1:43:41] get so great you can't hardly stand it
[1:43:44] he knows how to sympathize with you he
[1:43:46] he sets there to make intercession he
[1:43:49] sits there to love you
[1:43:50] and though you go astray he won't
[1:43:52] forsake you he will still come after you
[1:43:54] and knock at your heart
[1:43:56] there's not a backslider in the building
[1:43:57] but what no that God knocks at his heart
[1:43:59] daily and he will do it as long as
[1:44:02] you're Immortal on this Earth for he's
[1:44:03] loved you he redeemed you
[1:44:06] poets has tried authors is trying man is
[1:44:09] trying to express that theme of love and
[1:44:11] it cannot be found in human expression
[1:44:14] one said o love of God how rich and pure
[1:44:17] how fathomless and strong it shall be
[1:44:20] forever it shall forevermore endure
[1:44:23] Saints and Angels song
[1:44:24] if we would think the ocean fill and
[1:44:27] were the Skies of parchment made every
[1:44:29] stock on Earth and quill and every man
[1:44:31] ascribed by trade to write the love of
[1:44:34] God above would drain the ocean dry
[1:44:37] nor could the scroll contain the whole
[1:44:40] the stretched from Sky to Sky
[1:44:43] you'll never understand there's no way
[1:44:45] for us to understand how that great
[1:44:48] sacrifice that he did came down and
[1:44:50] reconciled us back to God
[1:44:52] then he went back and said now I'll not
[1:44:54] leave you comfortless I'll come again
[1:44:57] and be with you even in you to the end
[1:45:00] of the world
[1:45:02] and in the sermon faith is the substance
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:07] so Paul said it was possible for him to
[1:45:09] do those things without
[1:45:10] having the giver though I speak with
[1:45:12] tongues as men and angels and have not
[1:45:14] charity it profeth me nothing see all
[1:45:17] right now love one another above
[1:45:19] everything you do love one another
[1:45:21] and as you love one another you'll love
[1:45:23] God see you'll love each other and
[1:45:25] you'll love God for God is love and a
[1:45:28] man that walks in Love Walks In life and
[1:45:30] perfect love casteth out all fear
[1:45:33] then if you can take him in his word and
[1:45:35] not fear a bit about it say Lord I love
[1:45:38] you
[1:45:39] I know you're going to answer because
[1:45:40] you promised me you would and I just
[1:45:43] know you're going to do it see
[1:45:45] and it takes away all fear
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:53] I know as I go through
[1:45:55] First Corinthians 13 and like I said
[1:45:58] it's something that I memorize as a kid
[1:46:00] year after year to be able to perform to
[1:46:03] The Homeschool Group and do these
[1:46:05] different things is
[1:46:07] it's scriptures that I've known
[1:46:10] for years
[1:46:12] but as I go through verse by verse and
[1:46:15] truly pay attention to what it's
[1:46:18] describing
[1:46:20] I can find the points that I don't quite
[1:46:21] measure up yet
[1:46:23] that I haven't gotten there yet
[1:46:25] that I can go okay
[1:46:27] Lord you said that in order for me to
[1:46:29] love you
[1:46:30] perfectly
[1:46:32] that you have to circumcise my heart
[1:46:37] as I read through First Corinthians 13 I
[1:46:40] can see some of the things that need to
[1:46:41] be circumcised that need to be cut away
[1:46:44] I need that Holy Spirit to be working so
[1:46:47] that I can love the way that I'm
[1:46:49] supposed to
[1:46:50] so that I can go beyond the other Greek
[1:46:53] definitions of love and I can say that
[1:46:56] my life manifests the agape
[1:46:59] the perfect love of God
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:06] I'm not one to try to call out anyone
[1:47:09] else it's not my job to tell you this is
[1:47:12] what you've got to work on well
[1:47:14] Luke you got to work on your patience
[1:47:15] man you're just you're not there yet
[1:47:18] that's not my role
[1:47:21] my role is to point back to the
[1:47:22] scriptures my bowl role is to examine
[1:47:25] myself
[1:47:26] and go okay Lord this is what
[1:47:28] this is the word you've given me
[1:47:30] this is what you've laid out and this is
[1:47:33] the description and the example you've
[1:47:35] given of how I'm supposed to love
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:39] Lord I can see where I'm not there yet
[1:47:43] and each one of us can take that time to
[1:47:45] examine and go okay this is what I need
[1:47:47] to work on
[1:47:48] maybe you are the most patient person in
[1:47:50] the world and that one doesn't affect
[1:47:52] you great praise the Lord I am so glad
[1:47:56] for you
[1:47:57] but what about all the other verses
[1:48:01] there's plenty there listed
[1:48:03] so if you can point to one and go I've
[1:48:06] got that one
[1:48:08] praise the Lord I'm not sure I can point
[1:48:10] the one and say I'm achieved it in any
[1:48:12] of them yet
[1:48:14] but I can definitely go through and
[1:48:16] start making it part of my prayer to go
[1:48:18] Lord
[1:48:18] this is what I'm supposed to be
[1:48:21] this is what you've laid out as the
[1:48:23] example this is what you've said is
[1:48:25] supposed to be in my life
[1:48:27] Lord I need you
[1:48:30] to be the circumcision I need your Holy
[1:48:32] Spirit to cut away what's not supposed
[1:48:34] to be there so that I can manifest the
[1:48:37] love that I'm supposed to
[1:48:40] let's go ahead and pray real quick
[1:48:42] Lord this has just been
[1:48:45] a simple sermon Lord It's
[1:48:49] Lord this is a section of scripture we
[1:48:51] have read
[1:48:52] year after year
[1:48:55] we have gone over it
[1:48:58] there are probably kids in Sunday school
[1:49:00] that could almost recite the entire
[1:49:02] chapter
[1:49:05] but Lord yet it's still some of the
[1:49:07] greatest instruction we have that this
[1:49:09] is the love of God that we're supposed
[1:49:11] to Manifest this is the love of God
[1:49:13] that's supposed to be showing in our
[1:49:14] lives
[1:49:18] Lord I pray that you would help me Lord
[1:49:20] that you would
[1:49:23] Lord you said that we have to be
[1:49:26] circumcised of the heart in order to
[1:49:28] love you the way that we should
[1:49:31] Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would
[1:49:32] do more of a work in me Lord that you
[1:49:34] would cut away the things that aren't
[1:49:36] supposed to be there Lord that you would
[1:49:39] help make me more like you
[1:49:42] Lord I know that's the prayer of my
[1:49:44] brothers and my sisters lohorten Lord I
[1:49:46] pray that you would just continue to
[1:49:48] work with each one of us so that
[1:49:50] we can manifest that love we can have
[1:49:52] our hearts right Lord
[1:49:56] so that we can be living before the
[1:49:58] world in the example that you would want
[1:49:59] us to
[1:50:02] or just accept our Praises through the
[1:50:05] remainder of the service Lord and
[1:50:07] Lord may you just be welcome to continue
[1:50:09] to minister to hearts Lord
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:28] every
[1:50:29] day

[1:52:26] you more
[1:52:28] every day
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:34] where you want to love him more
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:38] how do you show your love to him
[1:52:41] he says how can you love me
[1:52:44] or love God whom you haven't seen
[1:52:47] when you can't love
[1:52:50] your brother whom you have seen amen so
[1:52:54] our love for him is expressed through
[1:52:57] our actions
[1:52:59] I think love is is an incredible this is
[1:53:02] should be our utmost goal
[1:53:06] love should be
[1:53:09] it should be
[1:53:12] our primary
[1:53:15] um
[1:53:18] goal here on the Earth
[1:53:20] amen put that chart up there sister
[1:53:22] kalila
[1:53:23] the the thing that God is looking for
[1:53:27] what what caps the pyramid
[1:53:30] love
[1:53:33] love love
[1:53:34] caps the pyramid what does love what
[1:53:38] does love rest upon what age are we in
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:42] brotherly kindness
[1:53:46] that's that's where we are love should
[1:53:50] not even be a questioner in the church
[1:53:52] love should not be a question in our
[1:53:54] homes
[1:53:56] love shouldn't as I as I brought it out
[1:53:58] the other night
[1:53:59] amen the sacrificial love of the husband
[1:54:02] should is is she that that's that agape
[1:54:05] love that that love should be so
[1:54:07] expressed from the husband for his home
[1:54:11] that reverence
[1:54:14] that reverent love looking back to
[1:54:17] Christ
[1:54:19] and and loving him in in looking at him
[1:54:23] as I came from you should be expressed
[1:54:27] within all of you sisters in your home
[1:54:30] looking at your your husband
[1:54:31] [Music]
[1:54:35] have you ever have you ever done any any
[1:54:37] studies and and you've heard it you've
[1:54:40] heard it for years
[1:54:42] but if you've if you've listened to
[1:54:44] brother Branham
[1:54:46] he said the Capstone
[1:54:49] is charity
[1:54:50] that's that's the Capstone that covers
[1:54:52] it all if you get charity
[1:54:54] you you've got faith virtue knowledge
[1:54:57] Temperance patience godliness brother
[1:54:59] it's it's sealed in you he calls it the
[1:55:02] Holy Ghost
[1:55:04] he calls it the word age
[1:55:07] he calls it the bride age
[1:55:09] he calls it the word coming
[1:55:17] when brother Branham was pointing back
[1:55:19] to love
[1:55:21] he is he is tying it in with divine
[1:55:24] revelation
[1:55:25] he brings it all into that same thing
[1:55:30] so if our Revelation is not producing
[1:55:33] love
[1:55:34] then it's not the right revelation
