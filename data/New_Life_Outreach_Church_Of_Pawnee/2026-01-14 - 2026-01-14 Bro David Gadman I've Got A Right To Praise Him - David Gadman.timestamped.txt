[32:04] you walked right out again.
[32:08] And death has no sin.

[44:18] turn with me to Oh, there's I didn't see
[44:20] that hook over here. So,
[44:25] have your Bibles tonight if you want to
[44:27] turn with us to the book of Well, I was
[44:30] had this little thought on my mind. I
[44:32] was going to read from the book of St.
[44:33] Luke's gospel and and so but uh I just
[44:36] uh if you and I I had this scripture
[44:40] that I had put down but it seemed to
[44:43] lost it. I should have marked it but
[44:45] anyway was when Jesus come riding
[44:47] through uh Jerusalem remember and they
[44:51] was he was riding there and I I knew it
[44:53] was in Matthew but I I couldn't find it
[44:55] right now but he came riding through
[44:57] Jerusalem and they started praising him.
[44:59] Remember they started praising him. they
[45:02] uh you know cuz he went and told him to
[45:03] loose the that coat you know and all
[45:06] that and just uh he went into the temple
[45:09] and praising him and everything and so
[45:11] and and so Luke when he first got up
[45:13] here the first song he he was uh had
[45:17] sung was I got a right to praise him
[45:20] &gt;&gt; is that right
[45:21] &gt;&gt; pull that song up that that little that
[45:23] song there you know and
[45:28] &gt;&gt; hallelujah says I got a right to praise
[45:30] the Lord Yeah,
[45:31] &gt;&gt; I got a right to live my voice. Ain't
[45:34] nobody got a right
[45:35] &gt;&gt; like the children of the Lord
[45:37] &gt;&gt; who've seen the light. I've been
[45:39] redeemed by the blood of the lamb and I
[45:41] got a right.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; How many believe you got a right tonight
[45:45] &gt;&gt; to praise him? You got a right to lift
[45:47] your voice.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got a right to to to
[45:52] worship him. You got a right to raise
[45:54] your hands. You got a right to praise
[45:56] him. Did somebody find that scripture?
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think it's in St. M was
[46:01] St. Matthew's one of them. And I think
[46:04] uh St. Mark 11. I can't remember just
[46:06] all where they're at, but if you if
[46:08] somebody got that scripture just hand
[46:11] it's I know it's in St. Matthew, one of
[46:13] them when he came right in there. And
[46:16] just just bear with me. Amen. And try
[46:18] not to I ain't going to try to hold you
[46:19] too long.
[46:21] I got a three-hour sermon.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; That's just the inside joke. So,
[46:28] you know, so but anyway, we just uh so
[46:32] he come right in there, you know, he
[46:33] told him to go and loose the coat.
[46:35] Anybody ask for it till the Lord has
[46:36] need of them,
[46:38] &gt;&gt; you know.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Matthew 21.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Matthew 21. Thank you. There. Matthew
[46:42] 21.
[46:44] And let's just let's just uh read that.
[46:47] Start with Matthew verse chapter 21
[46:49] verse one. and said, "And when they drew
[46:51] nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
[46:54] Beth, Bethage, unto the Mount of Olives,
[46:58] it says that that they then sent Jesus
[47:01] to two disciples, saying unto them, go
[47:04] into the village over against you, and
[47:06] straightway you shall find and ass tithe
[47:10] and a coat with her. Loose them, and
[47:12] bring them unto me." And if any man say
[47:15] ought unto you, you shall say, "The Lord
[47:17] hath need of them." and straightway he
[47:20] will send them. All this was done that
[47:22] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[47:24] by the prophet saying, "Tell ye the
[47:26] daughters of Zion, Behold, the king
[47:28] cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon
[47:32] an ass and a colt, the full of an ass,
[47:34] and his disciples and would went and did
[47:37] as Jesus commanded them, and brought the
[47:39] ass and the colt, and put on them their
[47:42] clothes, and they sent him their own.
[47:44] And a very great multitude spread their
[47:46] garments in the way." Can you imagine?
[47:48] And there they were. They were taking
[47:49] their garments, took that old suit coat,
[47:51] maybe spreading it away cuz the Lord was
[47:53] coming.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "And they and the
[47:59] spread their garments in the way. Others
[48:01] cast down branch, cut down branches from
[48:03] the trees and stro them in the way." My,
[48:05] they just doing everything they could,
[48:08] &gt;&gt; couldn't they? And the multitudes that
[48:09] went before and that followed cried,
[48:12] saying, "Hosana to the son of David.
[48:14] Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[48:16] the Lord. Hosana in the highest. And
[48:19] when he come into the Jerusalem, all the
[48:21] city was moved, saying, "Who is this?"
[48:23] And the multitude said, "This is Jesus
[48:25] the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee." May
[48:28] the Lord add his blessings to the
[48:29] reading of the word. You may be seated.
[48:31] And I was thinking as brother Luke was
[48:34] leading that s that song there and I
[48:37] just uh happened to think of this quote
[48:39] and if I can uh pull it up.
[48:43] Hallelujah. It would I just thinking
[48:45] about it and and here's I want you to
[48:47] listen to this real quick and this is
[48:49] maybe where I want to draw my thoughts
[48:51] from if I can tonight if it'd be all
[48:54] right.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Sorry I had sent brother Nathaniel
[48:57] something but it just seemed like this
[48:59] just just uh spoke to me.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Listen what he said. This is in the
[49:03] message faith is a substance 1947. He
[49:06] said, "Listen, not long ago, I was over
[49:08] in Illinois, and listen, while we're
[49:11] talking of the colored, this come on my
[49:14] mind."
[49:15] He said, "I was in a big coliseum. Many
[49:18] of you know where I'm speaking of. And
[49:20] they're looking around and seeing
[49:21] different things. I seen a no colored
[49:23] man with a little ring of white hair
[49:26] around his head."
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[49:28] &gt;&gt; He come along like this looking. And
[49:30] after a while, he came to a certain
[49:32] thing. He stopped, took his head off, he
[49:34] held it behind him, he bowed his head,
[49:37] and I seen he was saying a prayer. So,
[49:40] can you imagine who he was? Brother said
[49:42] he's in this museum walking around
[49:44] looking at different things. And I I
[49:46] like to go museum museums and look at
[49:48] different things. And he seen he said he
[49:49] seen this colored man and said he seen
[49:52] him and said he was looking in this
[49:54] little window there and he took his hat
[49:56] hat off and just uh begin to uh uh uh
[50:00] about took his hat off, put it behind
[50:01] him, begin to pray.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; So brother said wonder what that was
[50:07] about. You know, he said yeah said I
[50:09] raised up looked over there and he
[50:10] looked like this little he said
[50:13] uh I walked up at him. He got through
[50:15] praying. I said, "Sir," I said, "I'm a
[50:17] minister." I said, "I seen you praying.
[50:19] What's so startling about the box?" He
[50:22] looked up at me, his poor old wrinkle,
[50:25] hardened cheeks and tears rolling off
[50:26] the side of his cheeks. He said,
[50:28] "Reverend Parson." He said, "Just look
[50:31] over there." I raised up and looked over
[50:32] there and it looked like a little old
[50:34] dress laying there. I said, "I only see
[50:36] a dress."
[50:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what many people just
[50:39] see, the natural signs." Yeah.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; I said, "I only see the dress." See, a
[50:43] lot of people come to church tonight and
[50:45] they say, "Wonder what's wrong with them
[50:47] people?" They're raising their hands.
[50:48] They're praising God. They're they're
[50:50] they're they're just giving him glory
[50:52] and worship and and and they they may
[50:54] not be uh uh uh uh running around or
[50:57] whatever, but they're just saying there
[50:58] some people may just be tears be
[51:00] streaming down their eyes and they're
[51:01] wondering what's the matter.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with these people? Hey, you
[51:05] go somewhere and you probably what's
[51:06] wrong with a certain person? I you know
[51:09] I I walked up brother Miguel to a lot of
[51:10] people and said maybe I said hey listen
[51:12] I I noticed you crying or whatever I'm a
[51:14] minister can I help you? Is there
[51:16] anything wrong and they they'll tell you
[51:19] maybe their problem or whatever it is.
[51:21] Now listen I thought that was neat how
[51:23] he just walked up there and he says he
[51:26] said told them about the dress and
[51:28] everything said I only see a dress. I
[51:30] just see the natural things. People just
[51:31] see the natural things but they don't
[51:33] know really what's going on.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "You notice that
[51:36] that that kind of a circle in it,
[51:39] Parson?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said,
[51:40] "Feel right here on my side." He said,
[51:43] "That's is a mark of a slave belt."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the blood of Abraham
[51:48] Lincoln."
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "It took the slave belt off of
[51:51] me. Why shouldn't I take my hat off and
[51:53] say a prayer?"
[51:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, WHY SHOULDN'T I COME
[51:57] INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD TONIGHT AND RAISE
[52:00] MY HANDS AND GIVE HIM GLORY? BECAUSE I
[52:03] HAD A SLAVE BELT ASS ON ME ONE TIME AND
[52:06] ALMIGHTY GOD TOOK IT OFF.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; SO I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM. I GOT A
[52:10] RIGHT TO LIFT MY VOICE. I GOT A RIGHT TO
[52:13] SHOUT TONIGHT. I GOT A RIGHT TO DANCE.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why shouldn't I take my head
[52:23] off and say a prayer?" So he said, "I
[52:25] think tonight if a colored man from the
[52:28] freedom of his right could take his ad
[52:30] off to the blood of Abraham Lincoln,
[52:32] what are Christians to do to the blood
[52:34] of Jesus Christ?"
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WHAT should we do TONIGHT
[52:39] ABOUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST? IF IT
[52:41] WASN'T FOR HIM TONIGHT, WE WOULDN'T BE
[52:44] HERE TONIGHT. IF IT WASN'T FOR HIS
[52:45] GRACE, YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE. I WOULDN'T
[52:48] BE HERE. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS GRACE,
[52:50] BECAUSE OF HIM GOING TO CALVARY AND
[52:52] TAKING MY PLACE, THEN I'M HERE TONIGHT.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO worship him.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; I have a right to give him praise.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you tonight?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you have a right to give him
[53:07] praise?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you have a right to give him
[53:10] glory?
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Hey, because if it wasn't for you or
[53:13] him, I mean, going to Calvary, taking
[53:16] your place.
[53:18] Hallelujah. I'm glad that the prophet
[53:20] explained that to me. How that the evil
[53:23] over there in Hebrews said that he he
[53:25] didn't become an angel, but he took on
[53:27] the form of flesh, the form of human
[53:30] being, TO BE TESTED AND TRIED LIKE ME
[53:33] AND YOU ARE, TO KNOW WHAT WE FEEL, to
[53:35] know what we go through, SO HE COULD BE
[53:37] A HIGH PRIEST THAT COULD BE TOUCHED BY
[53:39] THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES. OH, WE
[53:42] HAVE A HIGH PRIEST TONIGHT THAT CAN BE
[53:44] TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF OUR
[53:46] INFIRMITIES. WHEN WE'RE GOING THROUGH
[53:47] THINGS THAT ARE HARD TO BEAR, HE KNOWS
[53:50] WHAT WE FEEL.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN WE'RE TEMPTED, HE KNOWS
[53:56] HOW WE FEEL CUZ HE WAS TEMPTED.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH, BROTHER.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; When we're sick, he knows how we feel
[54:04] because he was sick.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right,
[54:07] &gt;&gt; sir?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad he became
[54:12] one of us so that we could become him.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank God for that.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brown said he would
[54:24] he came and became homeless that I might
[54:28] have a home.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; He became homeless that I might have a
[54:32] home.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He who knew no sin became
[54:37] sin. right?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he knows how I feel. He
[54:47] stooped
[54:48] so that I could be lifted up.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, he knows just how we
[54:54] feel. You remember when he came to that
[54:56] widow, Amen. or that woman, Amen, that
[54:59] was caught, they brought him threw her
[55:01] at his feet and said she was caught in
[55:03] the very act of adultery. What do you
[55:05] say? The law of Moses said she ought TO
[55:07] BE STONED. WHAT DO YOU SAY? THE BIBLE
[55:09] says he stooped. Hallelujah. He stooped.
[55:12] HE BECAME ME THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM.
[55:15] WHEN I COULDN'T COME TO WHERE HE WAS, HE
[55:17] CAME TO ME. HALLELUJAH. WHEN I COULDN'T
[55:20] GET UP TO WHERE HE WAS, HE STOOPED THAT
[55:22] I MIGHT BE lifted up.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. ANYHOW, I'M SO GLAD
[55:27] TONIGHT. AMEN. THAT HE became me. THAT
[55:30] HE COULD FEEL WHAT I FEEL, WHAT I GO
[55:32] THROUGH, WHEN I'M TEMPTED and tested. He
[55:35] was tempted and tested so he could be a
[55:37] faithful high priest.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; And so I CAN IMAGINE HOW THE PROPHET OF
[55:47] God begin, you know, to to see this uh
[55:51] uh uh man here, how he was crying and
[55:54] everything went over to him. One place
[55:56] he called him said he called him uncle.
[55:58] You know how he is. And he said, "Hey,
[56:00] what's the matter?" He said, "I'm a
[56:01] minister. I'm a par. I I I I'm this. And
[56:04] you know, oh what he said, he said, you
[56:07] look over there, you see the you see
[56:08] that dress, you see that spot on that
[56:10] dress? Said that's the blood of Abraham
[56:12] Lincoln. I'LL FEEL MY SIDE. THAT'S THE
[56:14] MARK OF A SLAVE BELT. BUT THAT BLOOD OF
[56:16] ABRAHAM LINCOLN TOOK THAT SLAVE BELT OFF
[56:18] OF ME. AND NOW I'M HERE UH GIVING HONOR
[56:22] to what Abraham Lincoln DID THAT I MIGHT
[56:24] CAN GO FREE. NOW WHAT ABOUT US TONIGHT?
[56:26] I'M HERE TONIGHT TO GIVE HONOR TO THE
[56:28] ONE THAT SET ME FREE FROM ALL MY PAINS,
[56:32] ALL MY DISAPPOINTMENTS. HE SET ME FREE
[56:34] FROM EVERYTHING.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that he set me free.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; So, I got a right to praise him.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; I got a right to live my to lift my
[56:46] voice. I got a right to shout. I got a
[56:49] right to say, "God, I love you tonight."
[56:52] I got a right to tell him how much I
[56:53] loved him, HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE HIM.
[56:56] OH, YOU MAY NOT WANT TO TAKE AN A
[56:58] ADVANTAGE OF YOUR RIGHTS, BUT I WANT TO
[57:00] TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY RIGHTS TONIGHT. AND
[57:02] TELL THEM, SAY, "LORD, I LOVE YOU. I
[57:04] APPRECIATE YOU. I THANK YOU THAT YOU
[57:06] SAVED ME. I thank you that you filled me
[57:08] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. I THANK YOU THAT
[57:10] YOU HEALED ME, LORD. I THANK YOU THAT
[57:12] YOU GAVE ME SALVATION."
[57:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; I thank you tonight, Lord.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you tonight.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you appreciate him?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:26] Oh, hallelujah.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; I appreciate him. I appreciate him so
[57:31] much. Oh, he's been so good. Now,
[57:33] listen. I looked this up just here
[57:35] quickly before I came out. It said
[57:37] Abraham's position on Abraham Lincoln's
[57:40] position on slavery in the United States
[57:42] is one of the most discussed aspects of
[57:45] his life.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Is that Lincoln Lincoln frankly
[57:50] expressed his moral opposition to
[57:53] slavery.
[57:54] In other words, he he discussed it a lot
[57:56] of times. His opposition, how that he
[58:00] despised it.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; I think brother Brand said he hit his
[58:04] fist when he saw a a slave being sold.
[58:06] He said, "If I have to give my my blood,
[58:09] I'll I I'll give it." Trying to set
[58:11] those people free.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; And he gave his blood. In fact, he was
[58:15] called the great emancip or the the the
[58:18] great emancipator.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; But you know what? There's one that's
[58:20] greater than him tonight. That's the
[58:22] Lord Jesus Christ. And if Abraham
[58:24] LINCOLN WAS CALLED THE GREAT
[58:26] EMANCIPATOR, I BELIEVE HE'S CALLED THE
[58:27] GREAT GREAT EMANCIPATOR TONIGHT.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WAS JUST CALLED THE GREAT
[58:33] EMANCIPATOR BECAUSE HE SET THE SLAVES
[58:35] FREE. WHAT ABOUT US TONIGHT? OH, I'M
[58:37] WORSHIPING THE GREAT GREAT EMANCIPATOR
[58:39] BECAUSE HE SET MY SOUL FREE.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It said however the question
[58:47] of what to do about it and how to end it
[58:50] given that it was so firmly embedded in
[58:53] the nation's constitutional framework
[58:56] and in the e economy of much of this of
[58:58] the country even though consecrated
[59:02] concentrated
[59:03] in it only in the southern United States
[59:06] was complex and politically challenge
[59:08] challenging there was also the question
[59:11] which Lincoln had to deal with of what
[59:13] would become of the 4 million slaves.
[59:15] leaves.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What would become of them?
[59:20] Oh, what about me and you tonight?
[59:23] WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF US? I TELL YOU
[59:25] WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF US.
[59:26] HALLELUJAH. WE GOT A HOME IN GLORY.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, they've got JUST HAD A HOME
[59:32] DOWN HERE AND COULD GO WALK AWAY FREE.
[59:35] OH, REMEMBER ON THE JUBILEE YEAR, THEY
[59:38] COULD THROW DOWN THEIR HOLE AND WALK
[59:40] OFF. AND AMEN. BECAUSE WHY? THEY WERE
[59:43] FREE. THEY HEARD THE JUBILEE SOUND AND
[59:45] THEY COULD GO FREE. BUT IF THEY WAS
[59:48] CONTENTED WITH THEIR SLAVE MASTER, THEY
[59:50] COULD SAY, "HEY, I WANT TO STAY HERE AND
[59:52] SERVE MY SLAVE MASTER AND THEY GO BEFORE
[59:54] THE PUBLIC AND GET THEIR EARBOARD
[59:56] THROUGH."
[59:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; And they'd remain a slave the rest of
[59:59] their lives.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; It was actually up to them whether they
[1:00:03] wanted to remain a slave or not. What
[1:00:05] about us tonight? What do we want to
[1:00:08] remain? A slave to the world or freedom
[1:00:11] in Christ? Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; It's up to us.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; He He's laying it before you tonight.
[1:00:16] You can go free or you can hey be stay
[1:00:19] right where you are and become a a a
[1:00:22] slave to the things of the world and to
[1:00:25] the devil for the rest of your life. I
[1:00:27] WANT TO SAY HEY LISTEN LORD I WANT TO GO
[1:00:29] FREE.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; LOCK ME UP IN A PRISON AND THROW THE KEY
[1:00:33] AWAY. DEPRIVE ME OF THE FEUD FOOD I EAT.
[1:00:37] EVEN BIND MY HANDS AND FEET. BUT AS LONG
[1:00:39] AS I GOT HIM,
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I CAN STILL go free.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I GOT HIM TONIGHT, I CAN
[1:00:46] STILL GO FREE.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; I can still go free tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just thank God for freedom. I
[1:00:59] thank God for a right to worship him.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank God that I can come.
[1:01:03] Hey, I thank God, brother Wendle, that I
[1:01:05] can go to a church of my choice and
[1:01:08] worship God by the dictates of my heart.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, people may say, "Hey, you ought to
[1:01:13] calm down or to be quiet." You remember
[1:01:16] they tried to give you There's always
[1:01:17] going to be a Pharisee around.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. To try to keep you quiet.

[1:01:23] the babes begin that were given that
[1:01:26] were uh given suck from THE MOTHER'S
[1:01:28] BREAST. THEY BEGIN to praise him. Yeah.

[1:01:33] "WHAT'S WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?" AND
[1:01:35] JESUS SAID, "HAVE YOU NOT READ THAT OUT
[1:01:37] OF THE MOUTH OF BABES AND SUCKLINGS, God
[1:01:39] has perfected praise?" OH MY, WHAT ABOUT
[1:01:42] IT TONIGHT? HE SAID, "IF THESE SHALL

[1:01:50] HIM PRAISE. THAT'S WHY I GOT TO GIVE HIM
[1:01:52] GLORY. THAT'S WHY I GOT TO GIVE HIM
[1:01:54] HONOR."
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Why would you want a rock to
[1:01:59] take your place?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want a rock to take my place.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; I want to take I want to do some

[1:05:36] "which Lincoln had to deal with." He
[1:05:38] said, "Of what would become," he said,
[1:05:41] "if liberated, how they would earn a
[1:05:43] living, a society they had almost always
[1:05:46] reject that rejected them or look down
[1:05:48] on them, their very presence." I

[1:06:23] OVER THERE. AMEN, brother Window. AND
[1:06:25] SIT AROUND THAT TABLE THOUSANDS OF MILES
[1:06:27] LONG AND SEE THE KING AND HIS BEAUTY
[1:06:30] COME OUT. AMEN. TAKE HIS HAND, HIS
[1:06:32] FINGER, WIPE THE TEARS FROM OUR EYES AND
[1:06:34] SAID, "DON'T CRY NO MORE. IT'S ALL OVER.
[1:06:36] ENTER INTO THE JOYS OF THE LORD THAT'S
[1:06:38] BEEN PREPARED FOR YOU before the
[1:06:40] foundation of the world."
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Won't it be worth it all?
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; It'd be worth all the trials, all the
[1:06:48] heartaches, all the battles we go
[1:06:50] through.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, thank God. So he said,
[1:06:59] "Hey,
[1:07:01] hallelujah. What was he going to do with
[1:07:03] them?" Amen. Now, I looked up something
[1:07:05] else and I thought this was real good,
[1:07:07] too. I thought, man, while I was back
[1:07:10] there, I said, "Hey, this came to my
[1:07:12] mind." So, hallelujah.
[1:07:16] And so, I looked this up and we used to
[1:07:19] live in Buford, South Carolina.
[1:07:23] And I thought, well, and they had the
[1:07:25] Marine Corps
[1:07:27] Air Station there.
[1:07:29] I don't know. And hey, and before as
[1:07:32] you're going into there, there's a sign
[1:07:35] and it says the noise you hear behind
[1:07:37] these walls
[1:07:39] is the noise of freedom.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, you ever hear them old jets, them
[1:07:45] F-150s and all? Hey, you know, them
[1:07:48] fighter jets and everything. I just like
[1:07:49] how they, you know, and all that and my,
[1:07:51] it just so it just so lovely and all
[1:07:53] that. Amen. To hear that noise. He said
[1:07:56] that. Now, listen what he said. The
[1:07:57] phrase, "The noise you hear is a sound
[1:08:00] of freedom is a common expression often
[1:08:02] associated with the loud noise of
[1:08:04] military aircraft such as fighter jets
[1:08:07] flying over communities near air bases."
[1:08:12] The saying serves to remind residents
[1:08:14] that the sound which might otherwise be
[1:08:16] considered a nuisance are direct result
[1:08:19] of military training and operations that
[1:08:22] protect national security. So you say,
[1:08:25] "Hey, they're flying over us and it may
[1:08:27] be a nuisance to a lot of folks."
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hey, just flying over there and hearing
[1:08:31] all that and them break the uh the sound
[1:08:33] barrier and all that, hear all that and
[1:08:35] it may be a nuisance, he said, but to a
[1:08:37] lot of folks it's for it's the noise of
[1:08:39] freedom. Hey, cuz they're fight they're
[1:08:42] fighting and they're training. That me
[1:08:44] and you can stand here tonight and
[1:08:46] worship God by the dictates of our
[1:08:48] heart. Men that went overseas and gave
[1:08:51] their life blood so that me and you
[1:08:53] could sit here tonight. SO ME AND YOU
[1:08:55] COULD PROUDLY WAVE THE FLAG THAT WE CALL
[1:08:58] GLORY. AND THERE AIN'T NOTHING WRONG
[1:08:59] WITH THAT. AMEN. BROTHER BROWN SAID IF
[1:09:02] you're a REAL AMERICAN, YOU WAS
[1:09:03] IDENTIFIED WHEN WASHINGTON CROSSED THE
[1:09:05] DELAWARE. YOU WAS IDENTIFIED WHEN THE
[1:09:08] BOYS LIFTED THE FLAG AT GUAM. YOU'RE
[1:09:10] IDENTIFIED IF YOU'RE A REAL AMERICAN AND
[1:09:12] IF YOU'RE A REAL CHRISTIAN TONIGHT,
[1:09:13] YOU'RE IDENTIFIED WHEN NOAH, AMEN, WENT
[1:09:16] INTO THE ARK.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; WHEN ELIJAH CALLED FIRE DOWN OFF OF
[1:09:20] MOUNT CARMEL, YOU'RE IDENTIFIED WITH
[1:09:22] THAT.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; If you're a real Christian.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; The noise of freedom.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Noise of freedom.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; What about it here tonight?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] that get the noise in in here and the
[1:09:36] neighbors have to call the cops on us.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Somebody can meet them at the door said
[1:09:42] it's all right. The noise that you're
[1:09:44] hearing behind these walls is a noise of
[1:09:47] freedom. Amen. THEY'RE JUST WORSHIPING
[1:09:49] GOD. THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST GIVING
[1:09:52] VENT TO WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR
[1:09:54] LORD. THEY WERE BOUND IN SIN. THEY WERE
[1:09:57] IN DRUGS AND PROSTITUTION AND ALL THESE
[1:10:00] THINGS. BUT GOD ALMIGHTY HAS SET HIM
[1:10:03] FREE.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To some, it could be a

[1:14:49] my voice. Ain't nobody got a right like
[1:14:51] the children of the Lord. Ain't nobody
[1:14:53] got a right like me and you tonight."
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what anybody says,
[1:14:57] but ain't got no ain't nobody got a ride
[1:14:59] like me and you tonight.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And I can see them as they was coming.
[1:15:03] He told him and brother M, he said, "Go
[1:15:05] and there will be a coat, you know, and
[1:15:07] a full of ass tied together." Said, "You
[1:15:09] loose them and and and bring them to
[1:15:11] me." And they said, "If anybody asked
[1:15:12] you, you said the Lord has need of
[1:15:14] them."
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And when they got to him, they took
[1:15:16] their coats off, put it on him, put him
[1:15:18] up up there. And he started going
[1:15:20] through Jerusalem. And they heard him
[1:15:22] coming. And they BEGIN TO SING, "HOSANA,
[1:15:24] BLESSED IS HE THAT comes in the name of
[1:15:26] the Lord."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I wonder who was following him.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; let's look. I can look get a little
[1:15:34] picture tonight of maybe some people
[1:15:36] that were following him. Here comes this
[1:15:38] little lady up and she was just raising
[1:15:41] her hands and giving him praise and
[1:15:44] glory, GIVING HIM HONOR AND EVERYTHING.
[1:15:47] AND MAYBE SOMEBODY STOPPED HER AND SAID,
[1:15:49] "NOW LISTEN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? WHY
[1:15:52] ARE YOU GIVING HER PRAISE? WHY YOU
[1:15:54] SHOUTING LIKE YOU ARE? WHY ARE YOU
[1:15:55] RAISING YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU ARE? WHY YOU
[1:15:58] WHY WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? AND AND SHE
[1:16:00] SAID, "NOW JUST A MINUTE. I'LL TELL YOU
[1:16:02] WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME." SAID, "IF THE
[1:16:04] ROCKS HOLD THE IF I SHOULD HOLD MY
[1:16:07] PEACE, THESE ROCKS WILL CRY OUT, BUT I
[1:16:09] DON'T WANT NO ROCK TO TAKE MY PLACE."
[1:16:11] AND SHE BEGAN to say, "YOU SEE THAT
[1:16:13] LITTLE MAN UP THERE ON THAT DONKEY?"
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; YES. YEAH.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Everybody said, "Yeah, we see him." So,
[1:16:19] if it wasn't for him,
[1:16:21] I can do this.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; But you see, this is my son right here.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And just the other day, I was taking him
[1:16:29] down to the cemetery
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; to bury him.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; See, my husband had died.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; And I had need of my husband.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; So my son then he died and I surely did
[1:16:41] have need of him and my heart WAS JUST
[1:16:43] SO HEAVY. BUT THAT LITTLE MAN UP THERE
[1:16:46] ON THAT DONKEY CAME BY MY WAY AND HE
[1:16:49] STOPPED THAT FUNERAL PROCESSION, LOOKED
[1:16:51] OVER IN THE BAR AND SAID, "LAD, I SAY
[1:16:54] UNTO THEE, ARISE." AND HE CAME UP AND I
[1:16:56] SAID, "GOD HAVE MERCY. I CAN'T HOLD MY
[1:16:59] PEACE.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; I GOT to praise him. I GOT A RIGHT TO
[1:17:03] PRAISE HIM. I GOT A RIGHT TO GIVE HIM
[1:17:05] GLORY."
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:10] OH,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; she said he's the great emancipator
[1:17:13] riding up there on that donkey.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; there's this guy
[1:17:24] following him. This man,
[1:17:28] ah, he was just giving him praise. Maybe
[1:17:31] he wasn't loud as that woman was. I
[1:17:33] don't know. But tears was streaming down
[1:17:36] his face. Brother Kobe.
[1:17:39] Oh, he was just crying. They come and
[1:17:41] said, "What's wrong with you, my good
[1:17:43] man?" He just said, "I can't help it.
[1:17:47] I just have to give fit to the way I
[1:17:49] feel. I can't raise my hands, but I did
[1:17:52] just I'm just weeping."
[1:17:54] You see, I was all bound down with
[1:17:56] devils.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; See what happened to me? I I I I had
[1:18:02] gone somewhere and drunk a couple drinks
[1:18:06] and again got home and my wife asked me
[1:18:08] what was wrong with me and I said,
[1:18:09] "Well, we had to work overtime." Lied.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Well, how how late did
[1:18:16] you work?" Then he told another lie.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Another demon entered him to where there
[1:18:21] was a legion of them in him. He said, "I
[1:18:24] was all confused. I was messed up. I
[1:18:28] didn't KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN AND I'D
[1:18:30] JUST WANDER OUT IN THE TOMBS AND I'D CUT
[1:18:32] MYSELF AND I'D BLEED AND ALL THAT STUFF
[1:18:35] AND I JUST SO MISERABLE. But then there
[1:18:39] was a storm b coming over.
[1:18:43] But I was just I just couldn't help
[1:18:44] myself. But you know what? He left and
[1:18:49] came across that ocean and brave that
[1:18:51] storm for the sake of one soul.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Now don't tell me to hush up. Don't tell
[1:18:57] me TO STOP WEEPING. I GOT A RIGHT TO
[1:18:59] PRAISE HIM. BECAUSE SEE, my family
[1:19:02] didn't even want to BE AROUND ME. MY
[1:19:03] KIDS WERE SCARED OF ME. I COULDN'T KEEP
[1:19:06] A JOB. I COULDN'T DO THIS OR I COULDN'T
[1:19:08] DO THIS. BUT BECAUSE OF THAT EMANCIPATOR
[1:19:10] SITTING UP THERE ON THAT DONKEY, I HAVE
[1:19:12] A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM. DON'T TELL ME TO
[1:19:15] BE QUIET. AMEN. I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE
[1:19:18] HIM. If it wasn't FOR HIM, I'M CLOTHED
[1:19:20] AND IN MY RIGHT MIND. AND IF IT WASN'T
[1:19:22] FOR HIM, I wouldn't be here.
[1:19:25] Hallelujah. He's restored me. He's
[1:19:28] restored my mind. He's restored my
[1:19:30] family to me.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't tell me

[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; I got a right to shout. I GOT A RIGHT to
[1:19:41] give vent of to how I feel.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He became me that I might
[1:20:02] become him.

[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't tell me to be quiet.
[1:20:08] Don't tell me to hush up. If it wasn't
[1:20:10] for that little man riding on that
[1:20:11] donkey, I wouldn't be here tonight. Oh,
[1:20:14] no wonder I want to give vent to my
[1:20:16] feelings. I want to say, "Glory to God.
[1:20:18] Hosana in the highest. Blessed is he who
[1:20:21] cometh in the name of the Lord.
[1:20:23] Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hey, let's just Can we
[1:20:28] take a couple more people?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think about maybe, you
[1:20:32] know, there's this woman that came up
[1:20:35] there and she would just oh oh, you know
[1:20:37] how it is. She was just lifting her
[1:20:38] hands up. She just worshiping him and
[1:20:41] everything and oh, she would just oh
[1:20:43] just sobbing and oh, and every now and
[1:20:45] then she'd go, "Glory to God." Every now
[1:20:48] and then she may say, "Hallelujah. Glory
[1:20:50] to him. Glory to the God in the highest.
[1:20:53] They might have said, "Who are you?" And
[1:20:55] she said, "Well, let me tell you my
[1:20:57] story." Amen. There I was I was I was uh
[1:21:00] had a blood issue.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And my I went to every physician that
[1:21:04] could be uh thought about. This person
[1:21:06] said, "Go to here. He's the greatest in
[1:21:08] the country. He probably can take care
[1:21:10] of your problem. He's got he's got all
[1:21:12] the all the modern medicines there is."
[1:21:15] Where I went to him. He didn't do me no
[1:21:17] good. I spent in fact I almost spent all
[1:21:19] depleted all my savings. So he went to
[1:21:22] this other uh part they went to this
[1:21:25] other said what about this doctor? What
[1:21:27] about and she said I went to every
[1:21:28] physician that could be known to man
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; and I depleted all my savings. I
[1:21:33] depleted all my living. I didn't have
[1:21:35] nothing.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And yet I wasn't no better. In fact I
[1:21:39] was worse.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; They said but why you pray? said, "You
[1:21:45] see that little man sitting up there on
[1:21:47] that donkey?"
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; He was in a crowd one day. Oh, God. And
[1:21:51] I'd heard about him. Hallelujah. He just
[1:21:55] had left Gyrus's h or on his way to
[1:21:57] Gyrus's house. His daughter had died
[1:22:01] going down. And I heard them come to
[1:22:04] Gyrus, the priest, AND THE THE THEO
[1:22:07] THEOLOGIANS OF THAT DAY, and they said,
[1:22:09] "Jyus, don't trouble the master no more.
[1:22:11] Your daughter is dead." Yeah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; And he told Gyrus, "Don't worry, but
[1:22:16] only believe."
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just only believe. And I
[1:22:21] heard that and I thought, my if he could
[1:22:23] raise a dead person, cuz I believe
[1:22:25] that's where HE WAS GOING DOWN THERE TO
[1:22:27] RAISE THAT daughter to his Gyrus's
[1:22:29] DAUGHTER TO LIFE. AND I figured out if
[1:22:31] HE COULD GO TO THAT HOUSE THAT HE WAS
[1:22:33] GOING TO AND RAISE THAT girl from the
[1:22:35] dead, surely this blood ISSUE OF MINE
[1:22:37] WOULDN'T BE NOTHING to him.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; and I couldn't get to him. The crowd was
[1:22:42] great.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE KNEW SHE COULD JUST TOUCH THE
[1:22:46] HEM OF HIS GARMENT.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; That's all she needed.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; You know how brother Brown describes it
[1:22:53] that he she he probably didn't even feel
[1:22:56] her touching.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; The crowd was great.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody was touching him, but in her
[1:23:04] mind, her heart, it dropped from here to
[1:23:07] here. That's what it needs to drop. I
[1:23:09] remember watching a film, brother Kobe
[1:23:11] of Martin Luther one time. He said, "I
[1:23:13] got it here." He said, "I got it here."
[1:23:14] Intellect. He said, "I got it here. I
[1:23:16] can speak it real good, but wait till it
[1:23:18] drops from here to here."
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted to do tonight.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I may have the message all figured
[1:23:24] out. Amen. And all that intellect,
[1:23:26] brother, but intellect has never saved
[1:23:28] anybody. Intellect has never gave
[1:23:30] anybody the Holy Ghost. Intellect has
[1:23:32] never set anybody free. Intellect had
[1:23:35] never gave anybody their freedom.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And you may speak it. You may know the
[1:23:40] the message cliches.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; We always want to know the message
[1:23:48] terms.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Feel like the more we know the message
[1:23:51] terms and the message cliches that we'll
[1:23:55] get closer to God. But that don't get us
[1:23:57] CLOSER TO GOD. SOMETIMES THAT JUST give
[1:23:59] gets us further away. Or if we know this
[1:24:02] personality OR WE KNOW THIS personality
[1:24:04] or we know THIS ONE. I REMEMBER ONE TIME
[1:24:07] JACK CO. YOU REMEMBER HIM? He said,
[1:24:09] "Hey, he he laid his hand on this woman,
[1:24:12] Brother Window." She said, "She it he
[1:24:13] was cold as ice." After he prayed for
[1:24:16] her, she left. He left and she leaned
[1:24:19] over to another sister said, "Well, I've
[1:24:20] been to them all now." He turned around
[1:24:24] said, rebuked her, SAID, "YOU SHOULDN'T
[1:24:25] HAVE WENT TO WILLIAM BRANDOM. YOU
[1:24:27] SHOULDN'T HAVE WENT to AA Allen. You
[1:24:28] should have went to God."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that, hey, I might have
[1:24:32] not sat in brother Brandham's message
[1:24:34] meetings or whatever, but I've come to
[1:24:36] God. I REMEMBER SOMEBODY saying one time
[1:24:38] and they they ran into somebody in a
[1:24:40] grocery store and that lady was just a
[1:24:42] smiling. Oh, she was just so happy. He
[1:24:44] said he wanted to find out what was her
[1:24:46] made her so happy and he she finally
[1:24:48] caught up with her cuz anybody smiling
[1:24:50] in her grocery store has to be own
[1:24:52] something or whatever, you know, or
[1:24:54] whatever. She said, "Ma'am, I noticed
[1:24:56] you were just so full of joy and so
[1:24:57] happy." Said, "What's wrong with you?"
[1:24:59] She said, "I want to tell you AA Allen
[1:25:01] prayed for me." And that's why she was
[1:25:04] SO HAPPY BECAUSE AA ALLEN had prayed for
[1:25:06] her. Well, I tell you one thing. AA
[1:25:08] ALLEN DIDN'T PRAY for me. I never did
[1:25:10] get in a prayer line of William
[1:25:11] Brandham. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING, GOD
[1:25:13] PRAYED FOR ME. HE TOLD PETER SAID, "I
[1:25:14] PRAY FOR YOU, PETER." HALLELUJAH. I'M
[1:25:16] GLAD THAT HE HE SAID, "I PRAY THAT YOU
[1:25:18] MIGHT BE ONE EVEN AS MY FATHER AND I AM
[1:25:20] ONE."
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; And she said, "If I can only touch with
[1:25:26] the hem of his garment, I'll be made
[1:25:28] whole." Hallelujah. All of a sudden, he
[1:25:31] stopped.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Somebody touch
[1:25:36] me."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Peter started rebuking. Said, "Lord, the
[1:25:39] crowd, it's great. Look at everybody."
[1:25:41] He said, "Boy, but I feel different.
[1:25:42] Virtue has flown from me." And he looked
[1:25:45] around and he seen her. He said, "Woman,
[1:25:48] thy faith has made thee whole."
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she she probably could
[1:25:52] have told them guys that day, don't get
[1:25:54] on to me. Don't Don't hush me up. Amen.
[1:25:57] I don't have to be quiet. I got a right.
[1:25:59] Cuz if it wasn't for that man, I'd have
[1:26:01] been dead a long time ago. But because
[1:26:03] of that man riding up there on the
[1:26:04] donkey, I got a right to praise him. I
[1:26:07] GOT A RIGHT TO WORSHIP HIM. I GOT A
[1:26:09] RIGHT TO SHOUT. I GOT A RIGHT TO DANCE.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember that woman at the
[1:26:21] well when Jesus sent his disciples to
[1:26:25] buy some biddles? You remember? and and
[1:26:28] and sent him on away and and brother
[1:26:30] prophet God said he had to do it that
[1:26:31] way because you know how was because hey
[1:26:33] there was this they probably say hey why
[1:26:35] you going by because you know how they
[1:26:36] were just human beings like we were they
[1:26:37] was probably you know how it is
[1:26:39] segregation that woman brought up that
[1:26:41] deal segregation all that probably would
[1:26:43] have got on to the Lord why you going
[1:26:44] buy them dogs
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; why you going to buy them that place for
[1:26:47] that's nothing but a bunch of you know
[1:26:49] pigs or whatever they call them or
[1:26:51] whatever said that that we we don't have
[1:26:54] no dealings to do with them but Jesus
[1:26:57] said is said, "I have a need to go by
[1:26:59] the way of Samaria. I wonder if he's got
[1:27:01] a need to come by here tonight in Pony,
[1:27:04] Oklahoma, New Life Outreach." Uh, maybe
[1:27:07] somebody needs them tonight. Maybe
[1:27:08] somebody needs a Holy Ghost. Maybe
[1:27:10] somebody needs a refilling tonight.
[1:27:12] Maybe somebody needs uh uh uh uh to be
[1:27:15] energized tonight. And you're going to
[1:27:17] only be energized by the power of
[1:27:18] Almighty God. And he says, "I got a need
[1:27:20] to go by the New Life Outreach." Amen.
[1:27:23] To to to Ponyie, Oklahoma. There's
[1:27:25] somebody that's got a need. And then you
[1:27:27] can go out this door and people can say,
[1:27:28] "What's the matter with you? DON'T HUSH
[1:27:30] ME UP. I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM
[1:27:32] BECAUSE I HAD A NEED AND HE CAME MY WAY.
[1:27:35] HE CAME BY MY WAY AND I GOT A RIGHT TO
[1:27:37] PRAISE HIM."
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I got a right to praise him.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; I got a right to give him glory.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; I got a right to give him honor.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:53] I can see him going by that way because
[1:27:55] he had a need to go by that way there.
[1:27:58] That woman came out. She couldn't come
[1:27:59] out with the rest of the women because
[1:28:00] she had a bad name.
[1:28:03] You know, he was sitting on the whale.
[1:28:05] There's a whale sitting on top of a
[1:28:06] whale.
[1:28:08] I like that.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; She found her seventh and last husband.
[1:28:15] Completion.
[1:28:16] Hey, goes, "Hey," he said, "You had five
[1:28:18] and the one you're living with is not
[1:28:19] yours.
[1:28:24] He's sitting there and she came out.
[1:28:25] Y'all know the scripture. They begin to
[1:28:27] talk and said, you know, said, and he
[1:28:29] said, if you knew who I was and the
[1:28:32] gift, if you knew who you were speaking
[1:28:33] to and the gift to God, you'd have came
[1:28:35] asking me for a drink. Oh, sometimes I
[1:28:38] think it's like they said here about the
[1:28:39] natural and everything. I think
[1:28:41] sometimes we forget about it and we go
[1:28:43] to thinking about the natural and all
[1:28:45] that. She was just thinking about the
[1:28:46] natural because she said, "Hey, this
[1:28:48] well's deep. are you are you better than
[1:28:50] our fathers Jacob who dug this well and
[1:28:52] all that said hey he said she was just
[1:28:54] thinking about the natural but if we
[1:28:56] really thought about who he was and the
[1:28:58] gift of God you to come in here tonight
[1:29:00] and say God I need A DRINK TONIGHT I

[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; and he'll fill that cup
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; just lift your cup and he'll fill that
[1:29:18] cup.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, Brother David, my
[1:29:20] cup's got a bottom in it." Pray God give
[1:29:22] you a bottom in your cup, then pray that
[1:29:24] after he gives you a bottom in your cup,
[1:29:25] pray that he'll fill it up.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll fill it up tonight,
[1:29:30] won't he?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll fill it up. He'll put
[1:29:34] a bottom in that cup for you. He'll fill
[1:29:36] it up. He'll fill it to overflowing and
[1:29:38] it flow out on somebody else.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; I want Hey, I don't want only me to get
[1:29:43] it, but I want it to flow out on
[1:29:44] somebody else.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want to I don't want to come
[1:29:48] in here every night or in have my
[1:29:50] umbrella. I want to take my umbrella
[1:29:51] down. Amen. I like I said, I might have
[1:29:54] said it here. Somebody said, "Did you
[1:29:56] bring your thimble tonight?" No, I
[1:29:57] didn't bring my thimble. Did you bring
[1:29:59] your uh h a a cup tonight? No, I didn't
[1:30:01] bring my cup. I brought my tanker truck
[1:30:04] AND I BACKED IT UP TO THE BACK DOOR AND
[1:30:06] I'M SAYING, "FILL IT UP, LORD." AMEN.
[1:30:08] FILL IT UP, LORD.
[1:30:11] HALLELUJAH. I imagine how they got to
[1:30:14] talking. She said, 'Well, you know they
[1:30:15] say, "Hey, you say we're supposed to
[1:30:16] worship uh at the mountain, but uh we
[1:30:19] say Jerusalem." He said, "Hey, there's
[1:30:21] coming a time where you knew the words
[1:30:23] this mountain or Jerusalem, but the
[1:30:24] father seeketh s who worships him in
[1:30:26] spirit in truth." He told said, "Go get
[1:30:28] your husband. Come here." He said," he
[1:30:30] said, "Sir, I have no husband." HE SAID,
[1:30:32] "YOU'VE HAD FIVE, AND THE ONE YOU'RE
[1:30:34] LIVING WITH IS NOT YOURS." She said,
[1:30:35] "Sir, I perceived your prophet." He
[1:30:37] said, "We know that when the Messiah
[1:30:38] comes, he'll say all the us these
[1:30:40] things." He said, "Who are you, though?"
[1:30:42] He said, "I'm he that SPEAKS TO YOU."
[1:30:43] SHE LEFT HER one place. Brother Bram
[1:30:45] said she left her DENOMINATIONAL POT
[1:30:47] RIGHT THERE. RAN INTO THE CITY and said,
[1:30:49] "Come see A MAN WHO TOLD ME EVERYTHING I
[1:30:52] DID." He didn't tell her everything. HE
[1:30:54] JUST TOLD HER ONE THING.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; But I bet she realized that if he knew
[1:31:00] that one thing, he knows everything.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And so they ran into her that day, said,
[1:31:06] "Hey,
[1:31:08] don't tell me to hush up.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I got a right to praise him. I got a
[1:31:13] right to give him joy.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; I got a right to raise my hands. I got a
[1:31:18] right to dance if I want to. AMEN. WHY?
[1:31:21] BECAUSE THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR SAT THERE
[1:31:24] ON THAT DONKEY. AMEN. AT ONE TIME I WAS
[1:31:27] TROUBLED. I COULDN'T GO IN OR OUT.
[1:31:30] NOBODY WANTED ME. NOBODY WANTED TO GIVE
[1:31:32] ME THE TIME OF DAY.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But that man sitting up
[1:31:38] there on the donkey came my way
[1:31:41] and told me that I could go free.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And I took the well back home with me
[1:31:48] that day.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, don't you want to take
[1:31:51] the well back home with you?
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; I want to take the well back home with
[1:31:55] me. Every day, every hour of the day, I
[1:31:57] want to take the whale back home with
[1:31:58] me.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what's that? I hear I hear the
[1:32:03] sound of freedom in here tonight. Amen.
[1:32:06] Are you free tonight? Can you worship
[1:32:08] God tonight?
[1:32:10] Cuz you know as well as I do that if it
[1:32:13] wasn't for the grace of God, you
[1:32:15] wouldn't be here.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Caleb, if I told you right there, son,
[1:32:19] if I told you, come here. I got $500 in
[1:32:21] my pocket. If you'll just come up here
[1:32:22] and get it, and he came up here and get
[1:32:24] it, then he'd go around the next day
[1:32:26] said, "David, brother David, can I come
[1:32:27] mow your grass?" Why? Well, you gave me
[1:32:30] $500. That was a gift. I just gave it to
[1:32:33] you. You didn't have to do nothing for
[1:32:34] it. THAT WAS THE GRACE OF GOD.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; WE didn't have to do nothing for it. WE
[1:32:39] DIDN'T EARN IT. WE DIDN'T MARRY IT. HE
[1:32:41] JUST GAVE IT TO US.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; How many's been pulled over by a cop?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And you know the first thing they asked
[1:32:48] you, son or ma'am, do you know why I
[1:32:50] pulled you over? You said, "Well, come
[1:32:52] on. Don't lie now. You know why he
[1:32:54] pulled you over."
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Boy, I ALREADY THROW THE
[1:32:59] BOOK AT YOU."
[1:33:02] But if you said, "You know what? Just go
[1:33:04] on
[1:33:06] and don't speed no more. Be careful.
[1:33:08] What is that? Mercy.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you deserve to get a ticket
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; cuz you was doing wrong. But he gave you
[1:33:17] mercy.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; The judge said, "You're guilty. Do you
[1:33:22] have anything to say?"
[1:33:24] I turned and I spoke up. Said, "Your
[1:33:27] honor, I have no defense." That's when
[1:33:30] mercy walked in and PLEADED MY CASE.
[1:33:34] HALLELUJAH. THE BLOOD WAS PRESENTED.
[1:33:36] HALLELUJAH. I GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE HIM.

[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I'm singing glory.
[1:40:55] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; There sing his holy name.
[1:41:07] He's the great emancipator.
[1:41:14] That's the soul of the redeemer.
[1:41:21] You know what? As they're playing that
[1:41:22] softly, you know, I just love the Lord.
[1:41:26] I just thank him for healing me, for
[1:41:28] giving me grace, Lord. I thank him for
[1:41:31] touching my wife. I mean, we've been
[1:41:33] going through it. Seemed like the last
[1:41:35] year, year and a half. But hey, God's
[1:41:36] been so gracious. He's always been good.
[1:41:38] He's always provided.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; When we seemed like we didn't know maybe
[1:41:42] where the next daughter or something was
[1:41:43] coming, he's always provided. He's
[1:41:46] always made a way. I remember, hey, I
[1:41:48] got a right to praise him. I got a right
[1:41:50] to worship him. I remember the first
[1:41:52] time I ever ran down the aisle.
[1:41:55] There's a brother that came and preached
[1:41:57] for us. I ain't going to call his name.
[1:41:59] Some of you may know him. If I call him,
[1:42:00] he's gone on now. And he was a P. Wow.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; It's in a prison camp. He knew what it
[1:42:08] was to be free.
[1:42:11] He he he one time they told him they'll
[1:42:13] go pick up this log and carry it down a
[1:42:15] little ways by himself.
[1:42:18] Said they treated him awful in that
[1:42:20] prison camp. Said he was there by
[1:42:23] himself, brother. He said he did not
[1:42:25] know how he was going to take that log
[1:42:28] back down there by himself.
[1:42:31] and he got it up and he just and then
[1:42:33] all of a sudden he heard felt it just
[1:42:36] like that. He knew somebody was behind
[1:42:38] him helping him. They walked down there
[1:42:41] and laid it down there where it's
[1:42:42] supposed to be. He turned around and
[1:42:44] there was nobody there.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "I know who it was."
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; I remember one time he would just he
[1:42:53] preached a message, you know, worshiping
[1:42:56] God. What is that scripture? Living in
[1:42:58] unrighteousness but trying to r worship
[1:43:01] a righteous God. And he went down that
[1:43:04] aisle. He just going like this down that
[1:43:06] aisle. And all of a sudden I said to
[1:43:08] myself, I said, "Man, I wish I was out
[1:43:10] there with him." And brother Window, I
[1:43:12] don't know what happened,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; but all of a sudden something happened
[1:43:16] to me, Sister Martin. Amen. Something
[1:43:19] hit me. And I ran down that aisle just
[1:43:21] as fast as I could. Man, JUST DANCING
[1:43:24] AROUND. JUMPED in Brother Clark's arms.
[1:43:28] I didn't know what hit me. All I said
[1:43:31] was, "I wish I was." He knew what it was
[1:43:33] to be free.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Remember, you remember Brother Brown
[1:43:38] talking about that eagle that is in that
[1:43:40] Cincinnati zoo that was caged in,
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; beating his head against the the cage
[1:43:45] and falling back and looking up to
[1:43:46] that's where he was born. He was born to
[1:43:48] sell the blue. He said, "But I'll show
[1:43:51] you another pitiful sight. It's what a
[1:43:54] child of God,
[1:43:56] a son or a daughter of God that was born
[1:43:59] to serve God, but the devil's got them
[1:44:01] all bound down or her bound down in a
[1:44:04] cage of sin. He said that's a pitiful
[1:44:06] sight. But once God comes by, Amen. and
[1:44:10] set you free. The great emancipator came
[1:44:13] by one day and set us free. Hallelujah.
[1:44:17] Amen. And we got a right to praise him.
[1:44:19] We got a right to worship him. Amen. And
[1:44:22] some of us may, you may not be a little
[1:44:23] emotional as some others, but I tell you
[1:44:25] what, SOMETHING GOES ALL OVER ME WHEN I
[1:44:28] THINK OF WHAT GOD, AMEN. HOW THAT HE
[1:44:30] CALLED MY NAME.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It was LAYING UNDER THEM SEALS.
[1:44:35] PERHAPS I DIDN'T. HE DIDN'T SAY David
[1:44:36] Gadman or Wendle Martin, but something
[1:44:38] on the inside for the window spoke to
[1:44:40] us.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Pulled back them pages. We found out our
[1:44:46] name was right there.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; No wonder John shouted. Everything in
[1:44:50] earth heard him. Everything was under
[1:44:51] the earth. Everything in heaven and
[1:44:53] under the heaven heard John cry out.
[1:44:55] Amen. We've been set free. Hallelujah.
[1:44:58] One of these days, oh brother, your
[1:45:01] husband, he won't have to be in a
[1:45:02] hospital room. He won't have to be on a
[1:45:04] walker, wheelchair, whatever.
[1:45:06] Hallelujah. One of these days, Brother
[1:45:07] Windle, we'd be sitting around that
[1:45:08] table thousands of miles long. Oh, I
[1:45:11] don't know. Maybe we'll be sitting
[1:45:12] across from one another, tears be run
[1:45:14] down, and we can say, "Brother Wendle,"
[1:45:16] you say, "Brother Dave, we made it. We
[1:45:18] made it. WE MADE IT." HALLELUJAH. I'M
[1:45:21] LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DAY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:23] OH, I'M SO GLAD FOR THE GREAT
[1:45:24] EMANCIPATOR tonight that set me free
[1:45:29] that I can worship him.
