[55:05] always interesting with these kind of
[55:09] services I was talking with brother
[55:11] Wendell just for a minute about it
[55:12] earlier I always love to see how the
[55:16] Lord works it out to connect things
[55:21] um so we'll see how the Lord works it
[55:24] out this time as well uh
[55:27] um I'm going to pick on my Sunday school
[55:31] class for just a moment boys do you
[55:35] remember what we taught on this
[55:41] morning well good then this will be
[55:43] fresh um so we're just going to be
[55:46] continuing off of what I worked on what
[55:49] I did with Sunday school um brother
[55:52] Wendell to talked to me this morning
[55:54] saying we were going to be doing this
[55:56] and I was thinking a few different
[55:59] directions but I kept kind of going back
[56:01] to what I had talked about in Sunday
[56:04] school and so that's where we're going
[56:05] to kind of build off of so um we can go
[56:10] to 1st Samuel chapter
[56:12] [Music]
[56:24] 7 1 Samuel chapter
[56:28] 7 and we're just going to read verses 1
[56:31] and
[56:40] two and the men of kirath jiram came and
[56:44] fetched up the Ark of the Lord and
[56:46] brought it into the house of abinadab in
[56:48] the hill and Sanctified elazar his son
[56:51] to keep the Ark of the Lord and it came
[56:53] to pass while the ark Abode in kirath
[56:55] jiram that the time was long for it was
[56:58] 20 years and all the house of Israel
[57:01] lamented after the Lord if you all have
[57:04] your
[57:09] seats
[57:11] this takes place after the Philistines
[57:16] had captured the Ark of the Covenant uh
[57:19] Israel had gone out to war um and the
[57:24] sons of Eli had taken the Ark of the
[57:28] Covenant out with them and they perished
[57:33] the Ark of the Covenant was captured and
[57:36] the Philistines took it and God
[57:40] Afflicted them for having his Arc of the
[57:43] Covenant and so they placed it on a cart
[57:47] pulled by two oxen um two mothers who
[57:51] the babies had been separated from them
[57:54] and The Oxen went straight back to
[57:57] Israel and they came to this place and
[58:00] so the Arc of the Covenant had returned
[58:05] to Israel but it was still in kind of
[58:08] this far off area it
[58:10] wasn't back to the center of the kingdom
[58:12] it wasn't back to uh where it should be
[58:16] where it was easy access for all it
[58:18] wasn't back in uh even the tent where it
[58:21] was supposed to be it wasn't in the tent
[58:23] that they had traveled with they didn't
[58:25] have a Temple for it to go to yet and so
[58:27] instead it was placed of in the home of
[58:31] abinadab and it was in this home for 20
[58:36] years and
[58:39] so abinadab and the people there they
[58:43] Sanctified one of his sons to to keep
[58:46] the Ark of the Lord
[58:49] but this was not a family of Levites
[58:52] this was not a family of uh those that
[58:55] were supposed to be taking care of the
[58:57] ark or those that were supposed to be
[58:59] watching over it it was somebody that
[59:00] was willing to take it into their home
[59:03] um
[59:06] and we know the story that goes on from
[59:09] there but I just want to think about
[59:11] this for a few moments that here the Arc
[59:13] of the Covenant is in this person's in
[59:16] this person's home and like I said this
[59:17] isn't a levite this isn't somebody who
[59:19] has spent all his life studying the laws
[59:23] of Moses this isn't a person who has
[59:26] spent year after year making sure that
[59:30] they know the way they're supposed to
[59:32] handle everything and so there was no
[59:35] way
[59:36] for his sons to be taught the exact way
[59:39] that they should be handling this they
[59:41] weren't they didn't have that in front
[59:44] of
[59:45] them and so when it comes time
[59:48] for you know 20 20 years passed this
[59:52] with the Ark of the Covenant there and
[59:54] it's something that they uh respect it's
[59:58] something obviously that they care for
[1:00:00] and that they were willing to bring it
[1:00:01] into their
[1:00:03] home but yet at the same time 20 years
[1:00:07] of this sitting
[1:00:11] there
[1:00:14] and it began to be the normal thing you
[1:00:18] would wake every day and here's the
[1:00:22] ark there's you know if we think about
[1:00:25] the way that God had set aside the ark
[1:00:28] to be handled it was only to be handled
[1:00:31] by the priests it was obviously getting
[1:00:35] ahead of the story but it was only to be
[1:00:36] transported by the priests and when it
[1:00:39] wasn't being transported it was within
[1:00:41] the holy of holies it wasn't something
[1:00:42] that just anyone could come and lay eyes
[1:00:44] on it wasn't just something that anyone
[1:00:47] could approach it there was a reverence
[1:00:49] about it that only certain ones could
[1:00:52] come only certain ones could come into
[1:00:54] the presence of the Lord only certain
[1:00:56] ones were able to come in you know only
[1:00:58] the high priest could come in and have a
[1:01:00] little bit of the Mana that was still
[1:01:01] saved within it and and all these
[1:01:03] different
[1:01:06] things but in this
[1:01:08] home it
[1:01:10] was just
[1:01:13] there there's nothing in here saying
[1:01:15] that they built a special room or
[1:01:18] special place for it there's nothing
[1:01:20] saying that they they they covered it or
[1:01:22] they did this or that or the other they
[1:01:24] were trying to take take care of it they
[1:01:27] were doing what they
[1:01:29] could but yet at the same time it was
[1:01:32] something that over the course of 20
[1:01:34] years
[1:01:36] became very common to them it became
[1:01:39] something
[1:01:40] that it's just there you know it's
[1:01:45] just it's just sitting up on the shelf
[1:01:48] and we walk by it every day
[1:01:52] and we take it up and dust it off a
[1:01:55] little bit on Sunday when we go to
[1:01:56] church
[1:01:57] and then it goes back on the shelf
[1:02:00] and you know I think probably most of us
[1:02:03] would say that we have multiple copies
[1:02:07] of the Bible in our house especially any
[1:02:09] of us that are married or have children
[1:02:12] probably every single person has their
[1:02:14] own copy and I don't know about most of
[1:02:17] you but I probably have all of my old
[1:02:20] bibles are stored on a
[1:02:22] shelf I have we have so many copies that
[1:02:26] there when it comes to message books we
[1:02:30] have shelves of of message books I have
[1:02:33] new copies I have old ones that were
[1:02:35] from my dad that the old compilations
[1:02:38] and these big brown hardback editions
[1:02:41] I've got these on my shelf I've got all
[1:02:44] these different things
[1:02:46] where we walk by them every
[1:02:51] day and they can start to be common to
[1:02:54] us they can start to be be something
[1:02:56] that while we still respect
[1:02:59] it you know in no way am I taking my
[1:03:02] Bible and throwing it on the ground or
[1:03:03] or rolling it in the dirt or dropping in
[1:03:06] the mud or doing anything like that
[1:03:08] we're treating it with some level of
[1:03:11] respect but the commonness begins to
[1:03:14] break down the reverence that should be
[1:03:16] there what's become so common begins to
[1:03:20] push aside the reverence that's what God
[1:03:25] that what God demands of
[1:03:27] us as we go into to 2 Samuel we find
[1:03:31] that that David has the desire to bring
[1:03:33] the Ark of the Covenant back
[1:03:36] into the center of Israel he wants to
[1:03:39] bring it to the capital so that it you
[1:03:42] know in his mind going the entire
[1:03:44] country will be blessed it's going to be
[1:03:46] more centrally located it's going to be
[1:03:48] better for the people to come worship
[1:03:50] it's going to be more of a blessing to
[1:03:52] all it needs to be here
[1:03:56] and we all know we've read this so many
[1:03:58] times that you know he comes in with
[1:04:02] the the best
[1:04:05] intentions he his desire is good wanting
[1:04:09] to bring the Ark
[1:04:10] in and so they come in and they come in
[1:04:13] with the new cart and they load
[1:04:16] it and two of abinadab sons are the ones
[1:04:20] that are
[1:04:21] driving the
[1:04:23] cart two of these Sons that for the past
[1:04:26] 20
[1:04:27] years have walked by this every
[1:04:32] day this is where I'm going back to if
[1:04:35] you think about it this was supposed to
[1:04:37] be something
[1:04:38] so holy so
[1:04:43] special that for most people in Israel
[1:04:47] if they sought it a couple of times in
[1:04:50] their life it was going to be a lot
[1:04:55] especially once they were no longer
[1:04:57] traveling in the wilderness and so it
[1:04:59] was just staying in the tent all the
[1:05:01] time it was supposed to stay in the holy
[1:05:04] of holies it was only supposed to be
[1:05:06] seen when they took it out to carry it
[1:05:09] as they
[1:05:11] traveled other than that it was a place
[1:05:13] for the priest for the high priest to
[1:05:18] go and yet these two that had been
[1:05:22] around it so much that had walked by it
[1:05:26] day by
[1:05:27] day that hadn't
[1:05:29] been schooled on all the laws and all
[1:05:32] the guidelines and everything that they
[1:05:34] were supposed to be
[1:05:36] following once again they weren't
[1:05:39] disrespecting The Ark in any way they
[1:05:42] weren't there's nothing in the scripture
[1:05:44] that says they were out worshiping false
[1:05:46] gods or false Idols or doing anything
[1:05:48] they believed
[1:05:52] God but yet the Ark of the Covenant was
[1:05:55] something that though they respected
[1:05:57] though they cared
[1:05:59] for some of the reverence had been
[1:06:03] lost and we go through
[1:06:05] and all of us have have read this
[1:06:08] they're going along and the cart
[1:06:11] jostles and Aza reaches
[1:06:15] out to keep the ark from
[1:06:18] falling once again the best of
[1:06:23] intentions he wasn't in his mind going I
[1:06:26] want to desecrate the ark I want to do
[1:06:28] this I want to do that he's going he's
[1:06:30] thinking I don't want this to fall in
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:35] dirt but
[1:06:37] yet even that led to the
[1:06:40] fact that the reverence wasn't there
[1:06:43] that went this is something I can't
[1:06:44] touch this is too
[1:06:46] holy Lord I don't want it to fall in the
[1:06:49] mud but I cannot touch
[1:06:52] this this is only for the priest this is
[1:06:56] only for those that have been set
[1:07:00] apart and Aza reaches out to St to
[1:07:04] stabilize the ark to keep it from
[1:07:08] falling and God slays
[1:07:11] him and in a lot of ways we'll look at
[1:07:14] this story
[1:07:16] and even as Christians we'll look at it
[1:07:19] and go Lord weren't you being just a
[1:07:21] little too harsh he wasn't he just was
[1:07:24] trying to keep your from falling in the
[1:07:26] dirt that's all he was doing was he was
[1:07:30] trying to keep it from falling in the
[1:07:35] dirt but yet all too often we can
[1:07:40] allow the things around us
[1:07:43] and our relationship with God to become
[1:07:48] common and once again it's not because
[1:07:51] we
[1:07:53] are wanting to walk away from what we
[1:07:56] believe we're not walking away from
[1:07:58] Christianity we're not walking away from
[1:08:00] the
[1:08:01] message we're not turning our back on
[1:08:03] any of
[1:08:05] them but it's become especially here in
[1:08:08] the United States it's become so
[1:08:12] easy I as I talked about before I have
[1:08:14] multiple Bibles on the shelves at home
[1:08:17] for either myself or my wife or my
[1:08:19] children I have message
[1:08:22] books in multiple places on multiple
[1:08:25] shelves in multiple
[1:08:27] boxes my phone has the Bible app it has
[1:08:31] the table so I can have the message I
[1:08:34] have it on my computer I we have it on
[1:08:36] our iPads we have it on it's everywhere
[1:08:39] I can get it any time that I
[1:08:41] want I can be
[1:08:43] sitting anywhere I could be sitting in
[1:08:46] the dentist office waiting room I could
[1:08:48] be sitting at the DMV waiting to get in
[1:08:51] I could be here there anywhere and I
[1:08:55] have
[1:08:56] access because in all those places I
[1:08:58] have my
[1:09:01] phone but yet if I want to actually
[1:09:04] think about the percentage of time that
[1:09:07] as I'm sitting somewhere I pull out my
[1:09:10] phone and I pull up the Bible or the
[1:09:16] table I am probably going to be
[1:09:20] embarrassed in fact I can guarantee if I
[1:09:23] take the time to truly map it out I'm
[1:09:25] going to be
[1:09:26] embarrassed I don't even have to think
[1:09:28] about it that long to
[1:09:30] go I don't do it that
[1:09:34] much in my home those message books that
[1:09:38] are on the
[1:09:39] shelves how often are they actually
[1:09:42] getting pulled off to be read how often
[1:09:44] are they actually getting
[1:09:45] handled those Bibles that are on the
[1:09:48] shelves even the one that's my personal
[1:09:50] I use this is the one that I
[1:09:52] use how often am I grabbing this when I
[1:09:56] want to take time to read for a moment
[1:09:58] or when I want to take a moment of
[1:10:00] quietness how often is that what I'm
[1:10:03] reaching for
[1:10:04] versus whatever interesting novel
[1:10:07] happens to be holding my attention
[1:10:10] or whatever self-help book or
[1:10:14] whatever topic I might be interested in
[1:10:18] learning
[1:10:21] about I
[1:10:23] remember I've heard the different
[1:10:26] brothers and sisters and I remember my
[1:10:27] own dad talking about when the message
[1:10:30] was first coming out and they would get
[1:10:33] a
[1:10:35] tape and they would be passed around the
[1:10:39] church they would gather together to
[1:10:42] listen to
[1:10:43] it because a new tape just came out we
[1:10:48] just got a little more of the prophet's
[1:10:50] word and they would listen to it over
[1:10:53] and over and over
[1:10:56] alone in
[1:10:58] groups everything because there was a
[1:11:01] preciousness to
[1:11:04] it it was something that they it wasn't
[1:11:07] just that they respected the message it
[1:11:09] wasn't just that they thought good of it
[1:11:12] but there was a preciousness there was a
[1:11:14] desire that I have to have
[1:11:19] more they held it up to
[1:11:22] a it'd be like they received that in the
[1:11:26] mail and they're getting all excited
[1:11:28] great I've got the next
[1:11:33] tape my oldest son got signed up this
[1:11:36] last year he's had this program where
[1:11:38] he's been getting boxes mailed to him
[1:11:40] that are different robots he can build
[1:11:43] and he's learning about different things
[1:11:45] with with engineering and circuitry and
[1:11:48] stuff and he gets so excited I just got
[1:11:50] the notification my box shipped it's
[1:11:53] about to be here and then it arrived
[1:11:55] lives and the first thing he wants to do
[1:11:56] is put everything
[1:11:59] together and it's great I love watching
[1:12:03] it but when was the last time one of us
[1:12:07] looked at a message that
[1:12:10] way when was the last time one of us
[1:12:13] looked at our Bible that
[1:12:15] way that it was almost as good as you
[1:12:18] know people would use the term opening
[1:12:20] up a it's almost as good as opening up a
[1:12:22] Christmas gift or opening up a birthday
[1:12:24] gift I'm coming in and there's something
[1:12:26] special
[1:12:29] here we go through all these times when
[1:12:32] we're going and we're
[1:12:34] reading our daily devotions
[1:12:37] and we're doing it
[1:12:40] on and we have this built into our
[1:12:42] routine we're like yes we're supposed to
[1:12:44] be into the word every single day we're
[1:12:46] supposed to be at church on Sundays and
[1:12:48] Wednesdays we're supposed to
[1:12:50] be at youth bible study on Tuesday
[1:12:53] nights we're supposed to be
[1:12:56] this that the
[1:12:58] other and yet it can start to become so
[1:13:02] common once again not that we're
[1:13:05] disrespecting it not that we're thinking
[1:13:09] badly but that we begin to lose a little
[1:13:12] bit of the reverence that we're supposed
[1:13:14] to
[1:13:15] have it begins to be something that we
[1:13:19] take for granted a little bit too
[1:13:22] much all of us that are married couples
[1:13:26] we maybe I'm only talking to myself
[1:13:29] husbands we can fall into that same trap
[1:13:32] with our wives where we start to to look
[1:13:34] at them
[1:13:37] and it's my wife I love
[1:13:40] her I'm always glad to go home to
[1:13:44] her but I don't write her quite as many
[1:13:47] notes as I used to or I don't write her
[1:13:50] as many letters as I used to or I don't
[1:13:54] run by the store and pick up her
[1:13:56] favorite chocolate bar quite as often as
[1:13:57] I used to or I don't do this or I don't
[1:14:00] do that whatever it was that was in your
[1:14:03] relationship is these were the things
[1:14:05] that where you were setting apart going
[1:14:07] she is that important I'm going to make
[1:14:09] sure to do
[1:14:12] these and wives I'm sure that you have
[1:14:15] some of those same things you can think
[1:14:16] of towards your husband the maybe there
[1:14:18] was a favorite dessert of his that you
[1:14:20] used to make sure okay I'm going to I've
[1:14:22] got to make sure to make this for him
[1:14:23] and get it for him and now it's just
[1:14:25] look there's food on the table that's
[1:14:29] enough particularly all the particularly
[1:14:32] all the wives that have children it's
[1:14:34] like the children are alive and there's
[1:14:36] food on the table so there any more you
[1:14:38] want it's
[1:14:41] here we can get so busy we can get so
[1:14:45] focused on doing the different
[1:14:48] things going to work
[1:14:51] providing rubbing shoulders with the
[1:14:53] world dealing with this dealing with
[1:14:54] that
[1:14:57] and it's not that
[1:14:58] I am going man I wish I had a different
[1:15:02] wife I wish I had someone
[1:15:06] else it's nothing going into that but it
[1:15:09] begins to hit this commonness of I know
[1:15:13] she's going to be there when I go home I
[1:15:15] know she's going to be there when I wake
[1:15:16] up to
[1:15:21] leave
[1:15:23] great and we run into the same thing
[1:15:26] with our relationship with God it begins
[1:15:29] to be common it begins to be something
[1:15:34] easy you see the same thing as in Samuel
[1:15:38] as when he becomes old and the Elders of
[1:15:41] Israel come to him and
[1:15:43] say we want a
[1:15:45] king your sons aren't serving God the
[1:15:48] way that they should so give us a
[1:15:52] king now they spoke the
[1:15:55] truth Samuel's children were not serving
[1:15:58] the lord they were not doing what they
[1:16:01] were supposed to do Samuel had appointed
[1:16:03] them judges and they were being
[1:16:04] dishonest they were doing different
[1:16:06] things they
[1:16:07] shouldn't so when the elders spoke and
[1:16:10] said that there was truth
[1:16:15] there but the next step they took to go
[1:16:18] we want a
[1:16:20] king we want to be like the other
[1:16:22] nations around us was the the point that
[1:16:25] you see that God had become common to
[1:16:29] them and they Samuel spoke back and he
[1:16:33] was angry he like why why would you be
[1:16:35] doing
[1:16:36] this and the elders spoke to him and
[1:16:39] said we're not rejecting God we're not
[1:16:42] turning away from him we're not we're
[1:16:45] not going to serve Idols we just want to
[1:16:48] have someone we can look to that will
[1:16:50] lead us into battle and will do all
[1:16:52] these
[1:16:53] things it logic ically sounded good
[1:16:58] logically it made
[1:17:02] sense but yet it demonstrated that their
[1:17:07] relationship with
[1:17:08] God and even their relationship to the
[1:17:11] prophet had become
[1:17:13] common it was no longer something that
[1:17:16] they had the reverence for it was no
[1:17:17] longer something that they held to a
[1:17:19] high
[1:17:20] esteem because they were now looking
[1:17:22] going no that's better
[1:17:25] this is not as value as
[1:17:30] much
[1:17:35] Samson didn't
[1:17:37] hold the anointing and his Nazarite
[1:17:42] vow with much
[1:17:46] esteem he did his different things and
[1:17:50] the Philistines were punished as he was
[1:17:52] going through but he was more focused on
[1:17:54] on his own enjoyment and his own
[1:17:56] pleasure he wasn't worried about
[1:17:58] following all the Old Testament laws
[1:18:00] that he was supposed to he wasn't
[1:18:02] worried about doing all the right
[1:18:06] things he
[1:18:08] wasn't turning his back on God per
[1:18:12] se but he also wasn't holding it up as
[1:18:16] this Nazarite vow is something special
[1:18:19] this Nazarite vow is something that I
[1:18:21] should hold on to it became common to
[1:18:23] him he knew that when he woke up he
[1:18:25] would be strong he knew that when danger
[1:18:27] came the spirit would come on him and he
[1:18:30] would be able to overcome he knew that
[1:18:32] no matter what challenge he faced the
[1:18:35] spirit would be there and he would be
[1:18:38] fine and it became something that was so
[1:18:41] normal and so common to him that it no
[1:18:44] longer held a
[1:18:46] value until he was
[1:18:48] willing to tell Delilah and sell out his
[1:18:51] secret
[1:18:55] it had become common to
[1:19:03] him in the door inside the door brother
[1:19:07] brandom says you say Lord I've watched
[1:19:09] it but tonight maybe it's been too
[1:19:11] common for me maybe tonight Lord if
[1:19:13] you'll just open my eyes of
[1:19:15] understanding and anoint my eyes with
[1:19:17] spiritual sight let me Lord see your
[1:19:19] presence tonight and know and understand
[1:19:21] that I'm living just before the world
[1:19:24] meets its end
[1:19:28] Psalms chapter 1 starting at verse one
[1:19:30] says blessed is the man that walketh not
[1:19:32] in the counsil of the ungodly nor
[1:19:35] standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth
[1:19:37] in the seat of the scornful but his
[1:19:39] Delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[1:19:42] his law do he meditate day and night he
[1:19:45] shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:19:46] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:19:48] fruit in his season his Leaf also shall
[1:19:51] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:19:53] prosper
[1:19:55] now the scripture doesn't say
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:59] that his knowledge in the law of the
[1:20:02] Lord is so
[1:20:04] great it doesn't even say that his
[1:20:07] understanding of the law of the Lord is
[1:20:08] so
[1:20:09] great but it says his
[1:20:13] Delight his desire his his wants his his
[1:20:17] goals his focus is on the law of the
[1:20:21] Lord
[1:20:25] his Delight is in the law of the Lord
[1:20:26] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[1:20:29] night it's something he spends time
[1:20:33] thinking about it's something he spends
[1:20:35] time looking at it's something that he
[1:20:37] puts a lot of time and attention into
[1:20:40] because it's of value it's of importance
[1:20:42] to
[1:20:43] him it's not something that he holds to
[1:20:47] be
[1:20:49] common but he holds it to be something
[1:20:51] that is precious
[1:20:57] in Numbers chapter 25 you find one of
[1:21:00] the children of Israel bringing a
[1:21:03] midianite midan itish woman in the sight
[1:21:06] of Moses and in the sight of all the
[1:21:09] congregation into their
[1:21:12] tent this Israelite doesn't care that
[1:21:15] what Moses has said what God has
[1:21:18] said he's found this woman that's what
[1:21:20] he wants and the scriptures tell us that
[1:21:24] Phineas the son of Eleazar the son of
[1:21:26] Aaron the priest saw it and he rose up
[1:21:29] from among the congregation and he took
[1:21:31] a javelin in his hand and he went in and
[1:21:34] slew
[1:21:36] them and God speaks to Moses after
[1:21:40] this and he says Phineas the son of
[1:21:43] Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest hath
[1:21:46] turned my wrath away from the children
[1:21:47] of Israel while he was zealous for my
[1:21:50] sake among them that I consumed not the
[1:21:53] children of Israel in my jealousy
[1:21:55] wherefore say behold I give unto him my
[1:21:58] Covenant of peace and he shall have it
[1:22:01] and his seed after him even the Covenant
[1:22:04] of an everlasting priesthood because he
[1:22:06] was zealous for his God and made an
[1:22:08] atonement for the children of
[1:22:13] Israel Phineas looked at it and this was
[1:22:17] not something that was common this was
[1:22:18] not something
[1:22:19] that wasn't important it was something
[1:22:23] that he was going to to be zealous for
[1:22:25] if God had said this then this was what
[1:22:27] had to be done you know we look at the
[1:22:31] three Hebrew children with
[1:22:34] Nebuchadnezzar they came up and they
[1:22:37] wouldn't bow down to the image and
[1:22:40] Nebuchadnezzar brings them up before him
[1:22:42] and he
[1:22:43] says bow or you're going into the fiery
[1:22:48] furnace and these three are not
[1:22:51] prophets Daniel is not standing beside
[1:22:53] them
[1:22:56] they're friends with Daniel they are
[1:22:57] friends with the prophet but they are
[1:22:59] not prophets scriptures say nothing
[1:23:02] about them having the gift of being a
[1:23:06] prophet they're standing there and
[1:23:08] they're having this
[1:23:10] threat and they
[1:23:12] say King we
[1:23:15] know our God
[1:23:18] can we know he is able we know he can
[1:23:21] save us but whether he does or whether
[1:23:24] he doesn't we are not bowing
[1:23:30] down their relationship with God was
[1:23:33] important enough was precious
[1:23:36] enough that they were willing to die for
[1:23:39] it they were willing to die a very
[1:23:42] gruesome death for
[1:23:45] it this was not if God hadn't stepped in
[1:23:49] this was not an easy death they were
[1:23:51] about to go
[1:23:52] into this was going to be
[1:23:55] painful until the
[1:23:58] end but yet they were willing to stand
[1:24:00] there and
[1:24:01] go this is more important than my life
[1:24:05] this is more important than my wants or
[1:24:07] my
[1:24:08] desires this is that precious there's
[1:24:12] nothing common about
[1:24:14] this this is that important to
[1:24:20] me in Isaiah I'm sorry in 2 Chronicles
[1:24:24] we find King
[1:24:26] Uzziah and King Uzziah as he's is a
[1:24:29] Godly King and he's doing all the right
[1:24:32] things but he begins to get lifted up
[1:24:33] thinking himself to be something more
[1:24:36] important than just a king that God's
[1:24:40] blessing and he comes up and he feels
[1:24:43] like he should be able to go in and
[1:24:45] offer
[1:24:46] incense and he should be able to take a
[1:24:49] priest's
[1:24:50] place and he goes to the
[1:24:53] point where he is wroth with
[1:24:57] the the Levites and the priests that are
[1:24:59] trying to correct
[1:25:01] him and so God strikes him with
[1:25:04] Leprosy and he's a leper until the day
[1:25:06] he
[1:25:10] dies it had become common to him because
[1:25:12] he began to think of himself as more
[1:25:15] important than what God had placed
[1:25:18] him but then we step into the book of
[1:25:22] Isaiah Isaiah chapter 6 and verse one it
[1:25:26] says in the year that King Uzziah died I
[1:25:30] saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne
[1:25:32] high and lifted up and his train filled
[1:25:35] the temple above it stood the seraphim
[1:25:38] each one had six wings with Twain he
[1:25:40] covered his face and with Twain he
[1:25:41] covered his feet and with Twain he did
[1:25:43] fly and one Cried unto another and said
[1:25:46] holy holy holy is the Lord of host the
[1:25:49] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[1:25:51] post of the door moved at the voice of
[1:25:53] him that cried and the house was filled
[1:25:55] with smoke then said I woe is me for I
[1:25:58] am undone because I am a man of unclean
[1:26:00] lips and I dwell in the midst of people
[1:26:02] of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen
[1:26:04] the king the Lord of hosts then flew one
[1:26:07] of the seraphim unto me having a live
[1:26:09] coal in his hand which he had taken with
[1:26:11] the tongs from off the Altar and he laid
[1:26:13] it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath
[1:26:15] touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
[1:26:18] taken away and thy sin purged also I
[1:26:21] heard the voice of the Lord saying whom
[1:26:22] shall I send and who will go for us then
[1:26:25] said I here am I send
[1:26:30] me brother brandham talks about this
[1:26:33] verse and he talks about the
[1:26:36] seraphim and one thing that he makes
[1:26:38] sure to point out is they had wings over
[1:26:40] their
[1:26:42] faces they had to be in reverence at all
[1:26:46] times this is what they were called to
[1:26:49] do this is the place they were called to
[1:26:52] be but yet they weren't allowed to just
[1:26:55] look upon it just to look upon the glory
[1:26:58] of God they had to have wings over their
[1:27:00] faces
[1:27:01] covering because they had to be reverent
[1:27:04] through it
[1:27:05] all Isaiah has come to the temple and
[1:27:08] he's torn up and he's upset because he
[1:27:12] cared for
[1:27:14] Uzziah and now Uzziah has died
[1:27:17] and the first thing that God shows
[1:27:20] him is these beings that are made to be
[1:27:25] in his presence and they're made to have
[1:27:28] this
[1:27:29] reverence from the very beginning and
[1:27:32] for the whole time they're there they
[1:27:35] have to maintain this reverence because
[1:27:37] this isn't a position that they can
[1:27:39] begin to think of as oh yeah this is
[1:27:41] just normal I go to work every day yeah
[1:27:44] I work in the presence of God that's
[1:27:45] what I do it's all yep yeah just
[1:27:49] clocking in and going before God that's
[1:27:52] that's normal
[1:27:55] but they had to maintain that reverence
[1:27:57] and Isaiah is sitting
[1:27:59] there and he's going I'm not worthy of
[1:28:05] this it wasn't common to
[1:28:08] him he wasn't sitting there going that's
[1:28:12] right God you need to come down and talk
[1:28:13] to me and explain to me what happened to
[1:28:15] Uzziah he wasn't sitting there thinking
[1:28:17] that he was anything more than what he
[1:28:20] was he was sitting there and he was
[1:28:23] going God I am a man of unclean lips I
[1:28:26] do not deserve
[1:28:29] this and
[1:28:31] yet with that humility God was willing
[1:28:34] to come down and touch him with the coal
[1:28:36] of the
[1:28:37] Altar and then Isaiah could stand and go
[1:28:41] send me I'll
[1:28:44] go it's so easy for us to fall into this
[1:28:49] mindset of things being common because
[1:28:52] we get busy with life we get
[1:28:54] busy with work we get busy with the kids
[1:28:57] we get busy with this that and the other
[1:29:00] thing and like I said earlier we live in
[1:29:04] probably the country in the world where
[1:29:05] we have the easiest time to get
[1:29:10] this not only because of the freedoms we
[1:29:12] have but because brother Brandon was
[1:29:14] here in this country he spoke our
[1:29:17] language there's no translation
[1:29:19] needed other than you got to understand
[1:29:21] Kentucky English but you know we don't
[1:29:23] have to do a whole lot of translating we
[1:29:25] don't have to put it into a different
[1:29:27] language it's in our
[1:29:29] language it's here for
[1:29:31] us and yet because of how easy it is it
[1:29:35] becomes
[1:29:37] something that we don't hold quite as
[1:29:48] precious we need to be asking for God to
[1:29:51] take us back
[1:29:55] to the mindset
[1:29:57] that some of these Elders here had had
[1:29:59] when that tape would show up in the mail
[1:30:02] or that new book would come
[1:30:04] in and it was something so important so
[1:30:10] precious when we hear Brother Wendell
[1:30:13] talk about when he got the adoption
[1:30:15] series and listen to it and is weeping
[1:30:18] as he's listening to it because it's
[1:30:22] something that showing the value and
[1:30:25] he's realizing how important and how
[1:30:27] precious it is it wasn't something
[1:30:30] common it wasn't something he listened
[1:30:32] to it once tossed it aside and went on
[1:30:34] about his
[1:30:37] day I have a feeling he wore that tape
[1:30:46] out that is where we're supposed to be
[1:30:50] at even though it's now easy access even
[1:30:53] though we can now find the message on
[1:30:55] our phones we can have the Bible on our
[1:30:56] phones we can have all these copies and
[1:31:00] everything when we go to open up the
[1:31:03] word when we go to open up a message
[1:31:06] book this shouldn't be something that we
[1:31:09] take lightly this shouldn't be something
[1:31:11] that we enter into as common this isn't
[1:31:14] something we should enter into as the
[1:31:16] normal everyday type
[1:31:18] thing but this be something we should be
[1:31:21] going into and I'm preaching it myself
[1:31:22] here I'm not trying to say I'm above
[1:31:24] yall and I've achieved this but every
[1:31:27] time I'm opening up this Bible I should
[1:31:28] be going in going this
[1:31:31] is from
[1:31:33] God he spoke this through man and wrote
[1:31:39] it
[1:31:40] down and then left it here for
[1:31:47] me this
[1:31:50] is in all intents and purposes
[1:31:54] this may have as well have been God
[1:31:56] picking up the pen himself and writing
[1:31:59] every single
[1:32:02] word and that's the value I should be
[1:32:05] taking every time I open this every time
[1:32:07] I open up my Bible and I go in to read a
[1:32:11] verse let not your heart be troubled you
[1:32:15] believe in God believe also in me in my
[1:32:18] father's house or many mansions if it
[1:32:19] were not so I would have told you I go
[1:32:22] to prepare a place for you
[1:32:26] you this
[1:32:28] is God speaking this to us this is our
[1:32:33] husband writing to us going I prepared a
[1:32:36] place for
[1:32:37] you I have a home for you I have a place
[1:32:41] that you're going to that I'm calling
[1:32:44] you
[1:32:47] to this isn't just a book sitting on the
[1:32:51] shelf this isn't just
[1:32:54] the latest novel that's come out or the
[1:32:57] latest magazine or the latest
[1:33:02] whatever this is the word of God given
[1:33:04] to his children to his
[1:33:07] bride saying I love
[1:33:13] you and I
[1:33:16] want you to talk to me I want to have a
[1:33:20] relationship with you this is a God that
[1:33:23] wants to come down and every time we
[1:33:26] Kneel To Pray we're getting to speak
[1:33:28] directly to
[1:33:30] him these there things that become so
[1:33:34] common to us become so common to
[1:33:36] me and yet there are things that we
[1:33:38] should be holding and having so much
[1:33:40] reverence
[1:33:43] towards because it's a God that was
[1:33:46] willing to come down to man in order to
[1:33:49] bring man up to him
[1:33:53] Lord bless you
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:45] amen you love him here this evening how
[1:34:47] many enjoyed that from Brother Harry
[1:34:54] always uh listen to brother Harry preach
[1:34:56] and I'm just like wow wish I could be
[1:34:59] put together like that you know and yeah
[1:35:03] but um if we could here just for a few
[1:35:06] moments I'd like to look into a few
[1:35:08] passages of scripture uh just familiar
[1:35:11] passages uh just listening to brother
[1:35:14] wendle when he was preaching this
[1:35:16] morning and he ended on the story of
[1:35:18] Gideon and in the Book of Judges and
[1:35:21] it's always been a real favorite book of
[1:35:22] mine always enjoyed learning and hearing
[1:35:26] about the judges that of Israel but um
[1:35:30] you know here in the in the uh 13th
[1:35:33] chapter starting in the third verse I'm
[1:35:36] read a few verses here and then we could
[1:35:37] be
[1:35:39] seated
[1:35:43] but if you're there just say
[1:35:50] Amen but in the Scriptures it says here
[1:35:52] third verse3 chapter in The Book of
[1:35:54] Judges it says and the angel of the Lord
[1:35:57] appeared unto a woman and said unto her
[1:35:59] behold now Thou Art Barren and bearest
[1:36:03] not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a
[1:36:06] son now therefore beware I pray thee and
[1:36:09] drink not wine nor strong drink and eat
[1:36:13] not any unclean
[1:36:14] thing for Lo thou Hast
[1:36:17] conceived and and bear a son and no
[1:36:20] razor shall come upon his head for the
[1:36:23] child to be a Nazarite unto
[1:36:26] God from from the womb and he shall
[1:36:30] begin to deliver Israel out of the hand
[1:36:32] of the
[1:36:34] Philistines then the woman came and told
[1:36:36] her husband saying a man of God came
[1:36:38] unto me and his countenance was like a
[1:36:40] countenance of an angel of God very
[1:36:42] terrible but I asked him not whence he
[1:36:45] was neither told he me his name but he
[1:36:49] said unto me behold Thou shalt conceive
[1:36:51] and bear a son and now drink no wine nor
[1:36:55] strong drink neither eat any unclean
[1:36:57] thing for the child shall be a Nazarite
[1:37:00] to God from the womb until the day of
[1:37:02] his death amen let's go to the Lord in

[1:37:46] it it's easy to get up in front of some
[1:37:48] people but my Palms are sweating you
[1:37:50] know and got this weird Palm YY feeling
[1:37:54] in my in my hands and I promise you I've
[1:37:55] been washing my hands you know and um
[1:37:58] you know and I just wanted to say I
[1:38:00] appreciate all the brothers that come
[1:38:02] out and help save my house and my
[1:38:04] neighbor's house and and uh you know it
[1:38:07] uh you know you know besides you know
[1:38:10] getting to eat afterwards you know uh
[1:38:13] you know I I feel like we were just an
[1:38:15] incredible witness to Mike uh my
[1:38:18] neighbor brother uh you know he he was
[1:38:21] just all struck you know that we he was
[1:38:24] like all these people come to your
[1:38:25] church and I was like yeah he's like
[1:38:27] what are they doing here and I'm just
[1:38:28] like well they're here to put out the
[1:38:29] fire you know and he's like well I don't
[1:38:31] even know you guys and I'm just like
[1:38:33] well just how it is you know and just
[1:38:35] you know we're all just kind of you know
[1:38:37] band together kind of thing and he was
[1:38:39] just he was just flored you know uh you
[1:38:42] know the compassion and you know and um
[1:38:45] and he just expressed to me you know lot
[1:38:48] several times afterwards about how that
[1:38:50] he was just just floored by everybody in
[1:38:53] the pray and the things that you know
[1:38:55] for uh for Mike you know and we just
[1:38:58] pray that the Lord would use that moment
[1:39:00] and plant a seed in his life and and U
[1:39:03] you know and bring him on in and and um
[1:39:06] so again we just appreciate that and you
[1:39:09] know I I've always loved the story of
[1:39:11] Samson and it it's been just kind of a
[1:39:14] staple in in my life and you know you
[1:39:18] know before I'd ever heard about you
[1:39:20] know the Avengers or Power Rangers and
[1:39:23] things like that the the men the the
[1:39:25] people in in judges those were my heroes
[1:39:29] you know you you know I'd always thought
[1:39:30] of you know Samson and jeffa and you
[1:39:33] know some of the different ones and the
[1:39:35] where the spirit of the Lord had come
[1:39:37] upon these men and and God God was using
[1:39:40] these men during this course of time I
[1:39:42] believe it was in the in between time
[1:39:44] where there was no prophets and and he
[1:39:47] would be he would use these men to
[1:39:49] deliver Israel because Israel as you
[1:39:51] know as anybody that reads the Bible
[1:39:53] knows they just had a way of going in a
[1:39:55] cycle of things and and you know getting
[1:39:58] into sin and God with delivering and
[1:40:00] getting into sin and God would deliver
[1:40:02] him and kind of like what brother wendle
[1:40:04] was talking about going stop going
[1:40:06] around the mountain you know it's time
[1:40:07] to go northward you know and and I was
[1:40:10] just beginning to uh think about this
[1:40:12] and I had been listening there and um oh
[1:40:15] Lord once more uh there brother Brandon
[1:40:17] preaches there in 63 and and uh you know
[1:40:20] and I was thinking about this and and
[1:40:22] you know there in uh some of the Bible
[1:40:25] here and you can read on down through
[1:40:27] some of Samson's life and and how that
[1:40:30] you know if I could maybe just kind of
[1:40:32] parallel some of the things that
[1:40:33] Samson's life is with the believer you
[1:40:36] know and and we can all can kind of come
[1:40:38] to these sort of situations that Samson
[1:40:41] go through maybe we can relate to some
[1:40:43] of these things and you know and and I
[1:40:44] began to look at some of the things that
[1:40:46] Samson did you know the the scripture
[1:40:48] that we had just read you know the angel
[1:40:50] did come to did come to Samson's mom and
[1:40:53] was like you know you know don't put a
[1:40:55] razor to his head and he had also given
[1:40:57] her instructions to not you know drink
[1:40:59] wine or to have you know me different
[1:41:02] things you know meat that was unclean
[1:41:04] and and things and the reason was was
[1:41:06] because Samson was going to be set apart
[1:41:08] Samson was chosen Samson was was before
[1:41:12] his before he was even born he was just
[1:41:14] conceived into the womb but yet God had
[1:41:16] already thought of Samson God had
[1:41:19] already thought that you know what this
[1:41:20] is the individual that I'm going to
[1:41:22] raise up and and I'm going to destroy
[1:41:25] the Philistines through Samson's life
[1:41:27] and and we know that through these
[1:41:29] things you know that through Samson's
[1:41:31] life that you know that he was a strong
[1:41:34] man you know and and we through our
[1:41:36] lives you know we we were selected of
[1:41:39] God whether we like to believe it or not
[1:41:41] but the very reason you're here is not
[1:41:43] just because your mom brought you or not
[1:41:45] because your dad brought you or not just
[1:41:47] because you know it's just you drove by
[1:41:49] one day and you seen this building and
[1:41:51] you real like oh I should go there to
[1:41:52] church you know because because that
[1:41:55] that's just not the case but there's a
[1:41:57] deep that's calling to the Deep there's
[1:41:59] something that there's something that
[1:42:01] God was speaking out to us and that but
[1:42:04] there's something in you to respond and
[1:42:06] there's a lot of times where people will
[1:42:08] hear this message but there's not
[1:42:10] nothing to reciprocate there's not
[1:42:11] something where where they listen to it
[1:42:14] and and and they're like wow you know
[1:42:15] that you know uh you know wow that
[1:42:17] really spoke to my heart they're like
[1:42:19] well who's this Kentucky man or who's
[1:42:21] this or who's that but they never really
[1:42:23] grasps the Revelation that that this is
[1:42:26] the word for the hour and you know and I
[1:42:28] begin to think about this about how that
[1:42:30] Samson he was selected of God and he and
[1:42:33] and and his mother and his father did
[1:42:35] everything you know you read on down in
[1:42:37] the story he did everything or they did
[1:42:39] everything you know that the angel told
[1:42:41] him to do everything that there was in
[1:42:43] their instructions you know and and
[1:42:45] Samson begin to grow up and he was just
[1:42:46] a young he was just a young man and and
[1:42:49] he was actually he was he was going for
[1:42:51] a walk and he was going to
[1:42:53] you know he was he was going for a walk
[1:42:56] and and a lion come into his way and and
[1:42:59] he and the spirit or the scripture says
[1:43:01] that the spirit of the Lord come upon
[1:43:03] Samson and and he and he and he had got
[1:43:06] this strength and he slew this lion and
[1:43:08] and that on his way back from his
[1:43:10] journey that he had noticed that the
[1:43:11] lion that he had slew that it had it had
[1:43:14] honey growing in it or honey had come
[1:43:17] and bees had come you know and they had
[1:43:19] they had and they had made you know uh
[1:43:22] uh honey inside of him and and he took
[1:43:25] the honey to his father and his mother
[1:43:26] and they ate and he didn't tell them the
[1:43:28] story really about what happened and and
[1:43:30] I began to think about you know the
[1:43:32] second time where uh uh you know that
[1:43:34] that Samson had had been used of the
[1:43:37] Lord to where you know he he took foxes
[1:43:40] and and and you know him and the
[1:43:41] Philistines right about that period of
[1:43:43] time they had really started kind of
[1:43:45] going at it after each other you know
[1:43:46] before the foxes he he tied them
[1:43:49] together the scripture says that he used
[1:43:52] the the the that everybody knows the
[1:43:54] story about how that he was going to get
[1:43:55] married and and he was the Philistine
[1:43:58] woman and the the different changes of
[1:43:59] clothes and the different things but yet
[1:44:01] the the uh the scripture says that the
[1:44:04] Lord used that occasion to bring op
[1:44:07] between them uh for Samson and the
[1:44:09] Philistines and and we could see where
[1:44:12] Samson you know he got angry because of
[1:44:14] the Riddle That his wife had sold him
[1:44:16] out basically it's just what it was she
[1:44:17] sold him out you know sold him out and
[1:44:19] told them the answer to the riddle and
[1:44:21] and and and again he he was able to
[1:44:23] catch 300 foxes now I I I'm lucky to
[1:44:27] shoot one deer you know or you know just
[1:44:29] one deer a day but this man caught 300
[1:44:32] foxes all at one time you know and not
[1:44:34] only just caught these foxes but he tied
[1:44:36] their tails together and set them on
[1:44:38] fire you know and they they're running
[1:44:40] and then you know they're running all
[1:44:41] across the they're running all across
[1:44:43] the you know all all over the Plains and
[1:44:45] they're setting oil olive fields on fire
[1:44:48] wheat fields on fire you know and and
[1:44:50] then they then they sought occasion
[1:44:52] against Samson and Samson you know he he
[1:44:55] goes up on a hill and and all the
[1:44:56] Philistines they begin to surround
[1:44:58] Samson you know and and they're going to
[1:45:00] you know and but I believe it was Judah
[1:45:02] you know they they come up the
[1:45:03] Philistines come up to Judah and they
[1:45:05] were like hey you know we need you to go
[1:45:07] up there and get Samson off the mountain
[1:45:09] we need you to go up there so Judah
[1:45:11] walks up there and they're like hey you
[1:45:13] can't be doing this don't you know that
[1:45:15] the don't you know that the Philistines
[1:45:17] are Lord over us and that's something
[1:45:18] that caught my eye that You' got God's
[1:45:20] chosen people sitting there recognizing
[1:45:23] that that they are Lord over their
[1:45:25] enemies and I begin to think about that
[1:45:27] but that was Samson's entire purpose was
[1:45:29] to be there to deliver Israel from from
[1:45:33] the Philistines and you know and Judah
[1:45:35] walks up or uh yeah was Judah Judah
[1:45:37] walks up there and they're like hey
[1:45:39] you're going to have to come down over
[1:45:40] here so you know we can we're going to
[1:45:42] have to deliver you up and Samson's like
[1:45:44] well I'll go ahead and do it but but you
[1:45:46] got a promise that you're not going to
[1:45:48] put your sword against me either you
[1:45:49] know and and they're like okay we'll
[1:45:51] promise you know and so they they said
[1:45:53] now when we can do this we're going to
[1:45:54] bind you hand and foot when you go and
[1:45:56] he's like all right that's fine but you
[1:45:58] know I know the I know the rest of the
[1:46:00] story Samson was setting up the
[1:46:01] Philistines you know and then and then
[1:46:03] all of a sudden Samson you know he gets
[1:46:05] bound hand and foot and he arrives over
[1:46:07] there with the Philistines and the
[1:46:09] scripture says that the spirit of the
[1:46:11] Lord comes upon Samson and Samson gets
[1:46:13] out there and he just breaks he breaks
[1:46:15] the bands off of his hands and he breaks
[1:46:18] his bands off of his feet and the only
[1:46:20] thing that he had around him was just an
[1:46:22] old jaw bone well actually the you know
[1:46:24] the scripture said a new Jawbone if I
[1:46:25] got it right some you know something
[1:46:27] like that and he said that there was
[1:46:28] just a Jawbone that was standing there
[1:46:30] and or not standing you know it was just
[1:46:32] laying there and and the and the Jawbone
[1:46:34] was there and and he grabs this Jawbone
[1:46:36] and he just begins to just start smiting
[1:46:39] Philistines he just jumps right in the
[1:46:40] middle of them the scripture says the
[1:46:42] spirit of the Lord comes upon Samson and
[1:46:44] he just starts smiting Philistines and
[1:46:47] and he whips them all the way around and
[1:46:49] and and the Philistines end up leaving
[1:46:51] and and I begin to think about how that
[1:46:53] when Samson you know when he begin to
[1:46:55] get tired after that you know and he you
[1:46:58] know he sits down and he just thinking
[1:46:59] you know Lord I I've done this work and
[1:47:02] I I've done this you know I've smed all
[1:47:03] these Philistines but yeah I'm going to
[1:47:05] die of thirst I'm and I don't blame the
[1:47:08] man you know the man was working you
[1:47:09] know I mean he had a jaw bone and you're
[1:47:11] whipping a thousand Philistines you're
[1:47:13] going to be a little tired you know and
[1:47:15] and and the scripture says that God
[1:47:17] reached down and enclaved a hollow a
[1:47:19] hollow spot in the Jawbone of that
[1:47:21] donkey and and Prov divided water out
[1:47:23] out of the Jawbone so that so that
[1:47:26] Samson could drink you know and I begin
[1:47:27] to think about I begin to think about
[1:47:29] some of these things and about how that
[1:47:31] you know a lot of times in our Christian
[1:47:34] walk you know God gives us you know
[1:47:36] experiences in our lives he gives us you
[1:47:38] know uh just miraculous things you know
[1:47:41] and and how that how that you know those
[1:47:43] times are precious and and we should
[1:47:45] really keep those things and I love how
[1:47:47] brother Harry brought out you know we
[1:47:49] take things common and and we take
[1:47:51] things to where we for graned you know
[1:47:53] and just you know we can look in our
[1:47:56] lives and I begin to look out across the
[1:47:57] church you know and think about some of
[1:47:59] the things that we go through and y'all
[1:48:01] just you just bear with me for a minute
[1:48:03] but I'm just going to just going to talk
[1:48:04] you know and and I begin to think about
[1:48:06] how that there's a lot of things in in
[1:48:09] in our lives and I've seen a lot of
[1:48:10] miracles in our church and I've seen a
[1:48:12] lot of things where God has raised up
[1:48:14] and he's and he's destroyed devils and
[1:48:16] he's and he's mastered circumstances you
[1:48:19] know and for some reason I was listening
[1:48:21] to the message oh Lord once more and I
[1:48:23] begin to think about the time when when
[1:48:25] um you know Sister Katrina you know I'm
[1:48:28] sorry for putting you on the spot you
[1:48:29] know but I begin to think about the time
[1:48:31] when she had a problem with her rotator
[1:48:33] cup and in in her shoulder and and
[1:48:37] nobody knew about it because really
[1:48:38] Katrina doesn't say anything or she
[1:48:40] don't say much about you know her
[1:48:42] problems you know she just leaves it and
[1:48:43] she just prays to the Lord and and I had
[1:48:45] heard through the Great Vine you know
[1:48:47] okay we're just a small Church you know
[1:48:49] so you know I just heard through the
[1:48:50] grap Vine about how that you know uh uh
[1:48:53] how that her she had her shoulders it
[1:48:55] was hurt and I began to watch because we
[1:48:57] was at the old church you know and I was
[1:48:58] sitting in the back there and you know
[1:49:00] you could see everybody you know you
[1:49:02] could see everybody and what they're
[1:49:03] doing and all that kind of thing and and
[1:49:06] and I noticed that Katrina was Raising
[1:49:08] both arms and and she was praying to the
[1:49:11] Lord and she was just worship worshiping
[1:49:14] and and I was I begin to think I was
[1:49:15] like you know I thought her shoulder was
[1:49:17] hurt you know and I I begin to think
[1:49:19] about and I begin to I begin to you know
[1:49:21] just just think about these things in my
[1:49:23] mind and she got up and she had told the
[1:49:25] Lord she had gave a testimony about how
[1:49:27] that she told the Lord that if you would
[1:49:29] just if you would just give me the
[1:49:31] ability to to lift my hands and and and
[1:49:34] to praise God that Lord I raise them for
[1:49:37] you and and I begin to see there where
[1:49:39] where Satan Was Defeated you know and I
[1:49:41] begin to look back in in in you know
[1:49:44] some of our church history or where
[1:49:46] brother mural you know he had have that
[1:49:48] uh hyper thyroid problem you know and he
[1:49:51] just began to dwindle away and you know
[1:49:53] he thought it was a great thing there
[1:49:54] for a little while he called it his diet
[1:49:56] plan you know and he just he just eat
[1:49:58] everything that he wanted you know but
[1:50:00] yet he just begin to dwindle away and
[1:50:03] and you know I was there in PKA City
[1:50:05] when we were selling selling shoes you
[1:50:07] know the the sports there they were the
[1:50:09] hit you know the sports Air shoes you
[1:50:11] and we were there in Ponka City and and
[1:50:13] we you know sister Leah had called and
[1:50:15] she said you know she said you're going
[1:50:17] to have to come and help Merl he just
[1:50:19] come into the floor and he collapsed and
[1:50:21] and I remember us all backing up and I
[1:50:23] remember it's all heading towards
[1:50:25] towards Iola and it was a pretty good
[1:50:26] distance and when we got there you know
[1:50:28] brother murl he was just laying on the
[1:50:30] floor and we' prayed and and he had had
[1:50:32] his medicine you know sister Leah you
[1:50:34] know you better take your medicine and
[1:50:36] this that and the other and and he just
[1:50:38] stood on faith and he just believed that
[1:50:40] the Lord would heal would heal him
[1:50:41] because you know that's just what
[1:50:43] scripture says and and and and he took
[1:50:45] those things and you know and and God
[1:50:47] healed him of that hyperthyroidism and I
[1:50:49] began to think about the time where you
[1:50:51] know sister fres I remember that when
[1:50:53] she would had her high blood pressure
[1:50:55] and and you know her her she would just
[1:50:58] get you know kind of uh I called it
[1:51:00] loopy but it's not loopy but you know
[1:51:02] she would you know her like she would
[1:51:04] you know the pressure was just there in
[1:51:05] her head you know and she would and she
[1:51:07] would just get so bothered by it and and
[1:51:10] I remember there in New Mexico where
[1:51:12] where that you know she was there and
[1:51:14] she was prayed for and you know sister
[1:51:16] fres when when she believes something
[1:51:18] the next thing you know brother window's
[1:51:19] chasing her down and she throws all her
[1:51:21] medicine in the toilet you know and and
[1:51:23] she flushes it there in the toilet and
[1:51:25] and and you know the the Lord and the
[1:51:27] Lord healed her of that you know and the
[1:51:29] Lord Lord healed her of those things and
[1:51:31] there's some other stories you know that
[1:51:32] I'm sure crossed my mind but I remember
[1:51:34] you know just me and my personal life I
[1:51:37] remember you know I was telling somebody
[1:51:39] uh at at a table one time about how the
[1:51:41] Lord had had uh you know uh brought me
[1:51:45] out of my situation you know just as a
[1:51:47] young man and and the Lord had moved
[1:51:49] upon moved upon the church to to uh have
[1:51:52] prayer meetings and to have uh you know
[1:51:55] go and pray at the church and I really
[1:51:56] don't I was just real young you know I
[1:51:58] was just real little you know maybe I
[1:52:00] was probably you know Michaela's age and
[1:52:02] maybe a little younger or something like
[1:52:04] that but all the church was getting
[1:52:05] together and we had prayed that that the
[1:52:07] Lord would um you know uh come through
[1:52:10] for my mom's situation and that we would
[1:52:12] be able to you know that we could have
[1:52:14] she could have all of her kids and she
[1:52:16] can and and as at a young age I remember
[1:52:18] you know I was supposed to be praying
[1:52:19] but I wasn't you know and I just running
[1:52:21] around and and I would just be listening
[1:52:23] to people praying you know and getting
[1:52:25] next to them and hearing them and and
[1:52:27] ask and hearing them calling out to God
[1:52:28] and asking you know Lord that you would
[1:52:31] that you would intervene that you know
[1:52:33] with the judge and how that Lord that
[1:52:35] you would put in his heart to see that
[1:52:37] that God's doing something here and and
[1:52:40] I would just remember and and you know
[1:52:42] as a young kid you listen to these
[1:52:43] things but when but but when bosow
[1:52:46] showed up that day and and he dropped
[1:52:49] all of the he dropped all the luggage
[1:52:51] off at the door and he said here you can
[1:52:53] have them I I realized that that God was
[1:52:55] real and I realized at a young age that
[1:52:58] God was doing something and and that God
[1:53:00] wouldn't just put me in the situations
[1:53:02] in my life to where I could see these
[1:53:04] things happening and and I begin to feel
[1:53:07] God moving upon my heart but and and you
[1:53:09] know and I begin to think about how
[1:53:11] Samson he had gone through a lot of
[1:53:13] these situations in his life and he had
[1:53:15] gone he had seen the he he had real high
[1:53:17] Highs but he also had real low lows you
[1:53:20] know and I began to think about how that
[1:53:22] you know that that Samson you know he he
[1:53:24] he began to get a little cocky you know
[1:53:26] and and Samson began to get a little bit
[1:53:28] you know built up in himself and one day
[1:53:31] he met his match when he came to a
[1:53:32] Delila you know and he and then when he
[1:53:35] came to this Delilah you know that she
[1:53:37] was a trap for Samson and and Satan
[1:53:39] knows exactly where to come and he knows
[1:53:41] exactly where to penetrate whether it's
[1:53:43] through whether it's it might be video
[1:53:46] games it might be you know porn it might
[1:53:48] be music it might be drugs and alcohol
[1:53:51] or you know what whatever ever it is
[1:53:52] take your Vice you know it might be
[1:53:54] something in your life where God or
[1:53:56] where Satan's going to put his Delilah
[1:53:58] because we know that Satan's got one
[1:53:59] shot he's got one punch coming towards
[1:54:02] every one of our lives and I begin to
[1:54:04] think about how that Delila the
[1:54:06] scripture says that she pressed him
[1:54:09] daily and that how that every day in our
[1:54:11] life that Satan presses us daily in the
[1:54:14] things that we struggle in that he
[1:54:15] presses Us in music and he he presses Us
[1:54:18] in movies and he presses Us in games and
[1:54:20] entertainment and he presses because
[1:54:22] what he's searching for is your strength
[1:54:24] and he's what he's searching for is is
[1:54:27] what is it that makes you tick what is
[1:54:29] it that that gives you the ability to
[1:54:31] keep going further with God when when
[1:54:33] when you're stumbling here and you're
[1:54:35] fighting here and and and and and and
[1:54:37] you're just seems like you get you're
[1:54:39] going to give up but yet you still have
[1:54:41] the strength to move on and and you
[1:54:43] listen to what Delilah says and she says
[1:54:45] you know Samson what is it that's the
[1:54:47] secret of your strength and and the
[1:54:49] problem was was like our brother said
[1:54:52] that that God became common to Samson
[1:54:55] God became God became uh just just
[1:54:58] another person just someone that you you
[1:55:00] just shake your hand and you walk on but
[1:55:02] yet he didn't realize that the spirit
[1:55:05] that was on him was gifted to him by God
[1:55:07] and God Alone he begin to get cocky and
[1:55:10] he begin to lay in the lap the lap of
[1:55:12] Delilah and he begin to say oh if you
[1:55:15] just get new cords and you bind me
[1:55:17] that'll be the secret to my strength and
[1:55:19] he bust out of them when when when
[1:55:21] Delilah come out was like oh Samson the
[1:55:24] Philistines are on you you know that
[1:55:25] Samson would bust out of the new cords
[1:55:28] and he would get away you know but then
[1:55:30] the second time it was like he was like
[1:55:32] oh if you just take my hair and you
[1:55:34] braid it you know and and you put it in
[1:55:36] this certain way you know it it'll take
[1:55:38] my strength and so she would wait until
[1:55:40] he falls asleep because he's just
[1:55:42] hanging out with sin he's just hanging
[1:55:44] out with the world he's just hanging out
[1:55:46] with the things that he's not supposed
[1:55:48] to be doing and then sometimes I wonder
[1:55:50] if he was conscious of even what was
[1:55:52] going on he was just going through his
[1:55:55] everyday desires and whatever he W
[1:55:57] whatever he wanted but yet Delilah would
[1:56:00] say Samson the Philistines are on you
[1:56:02] the Philistines are are coming and and
[1:56:04] he would jump out the window or he would
[1:56:06] fight the Philistines you know and and
[1:56:09] after reading it a couple of times I was
[1:56:10] like man Samson You Know This Woman's
[1:56:12] plotting on you you know I mean she's
[1:56:14] you know she's fixing that she's fixing
[1:56:16] to take you out and you just keep doing
[1:56:17] it over and over and over and you know
[1:56:20] that's how it is that's how the Devil
[1:56:22] Comes upon you he makes you feel like
[1:56:24] he's your friend he makes you feel like
[1:56:26] that it's okay doing what you're doing
[1:56:28] because you can bust out of it you might
[1:56:30] go listen to some some music you're not
[1:56:32] supposed to and all of a sudden you can
[1:56:34] come in church and feel the spirit of
[1:56:35] the Lord or you can you can drink
[1:56:37] something or you can watch something or
[1:56:39] you can do something and all of a sudden
[1:56:41] you can come in and you can sing or you
[1:56:43] can preach or you can play music or or
[1:56:45] you can do these things and the spirit
[1:56:47] of the Lord still be upon you but the
[1:56:49] thing was was that she pressed him daily
[1:56:52] and the spirit of the Lord knew that
[1:56:54] that what was fixing to come and then
[1:56:56] one day the scripture says you know that
[1:56:58] Delilah was like you're making a mockery
[1:57:01] of me you know you're you're you're
[1:57:02] making fun of me you know and she was
[1:57:04] trying to play the victim when when
[1:57:06] really Samson was the victim you know
[1:57:08] and and she began to say you know you
[1:57:11] know what is the secret of your strength
[1:57:13] you know and if you're not careful you
[1:57:14] begin to give up the secret of your
[1:57:16] strength you begin to give a you know
[1:57:18] that it's whether it's prayer and
[1:57:20] reading your Bible and listening to the
[1:57:22] message and and you know and and the the
[1:57:24] the spirit of the Lord that comes upon
[1:57:26] you but yet Samson begin to begin to
[1:57:29] compromise with the world and he begin
[1:57:31] to compromise with the w with Delila and
[1:57:34] he begin to tell her that I'm a
[1:57:36] basically I'm a chosen Son of God and
[1:57:39] and and and I and and I have a promise
[1:57:41] and I have I have there's a there's a
[1:57:42] there's I have a vow I'm a Nazarite and
[1:57:45] there's never been a razor struck to you
[1:57:47] know put to my head there's never been a
[1:57:49] time where where I have you see these
[1:57:50] locks right here this it's my genealogy
[1:57:53] it's who I am it's it's something that
[1:57:55] the Lord has put on my life and at that
[1:57:58] moment right there he sold himself out
[1:58:00] and the scripture says that he was
[1:58:02] laying in laying laying in the on the
[1:58:05] lap in the knees of Delilah and and she
[1:58:08] called another man to come and sure his
[1:58:10] hair and and sure enough she said Samson
[1:58:13] the Philistines are on you and he
[1:58:15] thought that he could get up and he
[1:58:17] thought that he would be able to get
[1:58:18] away from it and he thought that he
[1:58:20] would be able to bust out of it because
[1:58:22] the scripture says he thought that he
[1:58:23] would do it just like all the other
[1:58:25] times before but at that point at that
[1:58:28] point Satan had staked him to the ground
[1:58:30] and the scripture says now this was
[1:58:32] pretty interesting I begin to think
[1:58:34] about this that you know they could have
[1:58:35] did a lot of things to Samson they could
[1:58:37] have took his life they could have cut
[1:58:39] his hands off they could have cut his
[1:58:40] feet off they could have cut his arms
[1:58:42] his tongue his ears he could have did
[1:58:44] any of those things but yet they plucked
[1:58:46] out his eyes and if you go and you look
[1:58:49] you look at where brother brand where
[1:58:51] brother brandom's talking talking there
[1:58:52] and oh Lord once more it's the spiritual
[1:58:55] application that the eyes placed and you
[1:58:58] know what is you play long enough Satan
[1:59:01] will go after the spiritual application
[1:59:04] you won't be able to see that that it's
[1:59:07] Satan that's fighting that's fighting
[1:59:09] you in between you and your brother he
[1:59:11] won't you won't be able to see that it's
[1:59:13] Satan trying to keep you away from from
[1:59:16] listening to the ministry or being able
[1:59:18] to read your Bible that it's just the
[1:59:20] tiredness all you'll see is tiredness or
[1:59:23] all you'll see is just this brother or
[1:59:25] all you'll see is just this sister or
[1:59:27] all you'll see is oh that this person's
[1:59:29] in a bad mood or this that or the other
[1:59:32] but what he does is that Satan wants to
[1:59:34] get you in the flesh realm and he wants
[1:59:36] to get you into a place to where you're
[1:59:38] not seeing what God sees like oh you
[1:59:40] don't attack the person but you're
[1:59:42] attacking the spirit that's driving the
[1:59:44] wedge in between you and your brother or
[1:59:47] you know you're attacking the spirit
[1:59:48] that's driving the wedge in between you
[1:59:51] and your prayer life and your and your
[1:59:53] and your time with God because Satan
[1:59:54] will throw many things he'll throw your
[1:59:57] responsibilities if you you know you us
[2:00:00] men you know we got responsibilities to
[2:00:02] make and we got you know deadlines to do
[2:00:04] we got bills to pay and you know we got
[2:00:06] you know we got cars to fix we got Lawns
[2:00:08] too we got you got a lot of stuff you
[2:00:10] know it's just a lot of things that we
[2:00:12] got that we got to do or you sisters
[2:00:13] about how that you know that you got
[2:00:15] children to take care of you got supper
[2:00:17] to make you know you've got you've got
[2:00:19] the house to tidy up you got laundry you
[2:00:21] know you've got you got things that
[2:00:23] you're doing around and if you're not
[2:00:25] careful you just become obsessed with
[2:00:27] all the things of life and you know what
[2:00:29] we don't realize what the enemy is
[2:00:32] trying to do because our purpose is not
[2:00:34] just to clean the house is not just to
[2:00:36] go to work but your purpose is to defeat
[2:00:39] the enemy here on this Earth and it's
[2:00:42] not your brother it's not your sister
[2:00:44] it's not it's not things that's going on
[2:00:46] out there in the world but it's the the
[2:00:48] it is Satan and his army that has been
[2:00:51] designed
[2:00:52] to be able to come after the believer
[2:00:54] and that was the issue was was was
[2:00:57] Samson forgot who his enemy was he
[2:01:00] forgot who who in fact he was laying in
[2:01:03] their lap but but yet now we see the
[2:01:06] scene where Samson his eyes were put out
[2:01:09] you know a a man of God if that's the
[2:01:11] way that you want to put it he was there
[2:01:13] and and he was sitting there and and and
[2:01:15] he was there and and and and the
[2:01:17] scripture says in the next verse that he
[2:01:19] was grinding at the meal of the enemy
[2:01:21] you know you know and and he had a lot
[2:01:23] of time to think then he had a lot of
[2:01:25] time to think about what he was and and
[2:01:27] all the Mountaintop experience where he
[2:01:29] was slayed a thousand Philistines and
[2:01:32] and you know he he captured the foxes
[2:01:34] and you know he killed the lion and all
[2:01:36] the different things that he had done
[2:01:38] but yet he was grinding at the meal of
[2:01:40] the enemy and you know if we're not
[2:01:41] careful we'll grind at the meal of our
[2:01:44] enemy we'll sit there and help produce
[2:01:46] you know that's what it is you know you
[2:01:48] go to a meal whether it's a great meal
[2:01:50] or whether it's a wheat meal or what
[2:01:51] whatever it is that's there they're
[2:01:53] grinding they're grinding that up for
[2:01:55] purpose and we want to we don't want to
[2:01:57] we want to be careful that we're not
[2:01:59] grinding at the Mill for the enemy for
[2:02:01] their purpose where where we're not
[2:02:03] sitting there and we're helping build
[2:02:05] his kingdom we're like you you see what
[2:02:07] I'm saying we we're we're not we're not
[2:02:09] there establishing his kingdom by
[2:02:12] thoughts and by words and by and by
[2:02:14] things that we say and things that we
[2:02:16] think but yet Samson was standing there
[2:02:19] and he was at the he was at grinding at
[2:02:21] the meal and and he was and he was just
[2:02:23] sitting there thinking Lord you know and
[2:02:25] we get to that place you know sometimes
[2:02:27] in our life where where we may not feel
[2:02:29] the presence of God in our in our or we
[2:02:31] may not feel the presence or we might we
[2:02:34] might not feel his presence in our Bible
[2:02:36] study or or in the song service or you
[2:02:38] might not you might not feeling when
[2:02:40] you're listening to a message or just
[2:02:41] the spark isn't there you know and and
[2:02:44] we might be sitting there thinking Lord
[2:02:45] where you at you know but God hasn't
[2:02:47] left you the thing is is when God gives
[2:02:50] the promise amen it's from the beginning
[2:02:52] all the way to the end I mean I mean
[2:02:54] there's a lot of us that are sitting in
[2:02:56] this church here this evening that was
[2:02:58] started by God but God hasn't left you
[2:03:00] and God is more than willing to finish
[2:03:02] his purpose in our lives and and he
[2:03:05] began to sit there and but the thing was
[2:03:07] is is the Philistines now this is the
[2:03:09] part that kind of gets to me was was the
[2:03:11] Philistines were proud of what they did
[2:03:13] the Philistines you know man it was a
[2:03:15] big deal to capture Samson you know
[2:03:17] because this man has slaughtered
[2:03:19] thousands you know you go back and you
[2:03:21] listen to the message where brother
[2:03:22] Brandon's preaching you know oh Lord
[2:03:25] once more there in 63 you know and he
[2:03:27] begins to say that you know that wasn't
[2:03:29] this the man he began to say that how
[2:03:31] that the soldiers were there and their
[2:03:33] AR he had they them them them Warriors
[2:03:36] had their big old arms around there uh
[2:03:38] you know you know to cut it short he
[2:03:40] just says the Jezebel you know them
[2:03:42] Jezebel women you know and he put their
[2:03:44] arm around their Jezebel women and he
[2:03:46] begin to they begin to talk to him and
[2:03:48] say well this was Samson this was the
[2:03:50] this was the man that just that his name
[2:03:52] would breed fear throughout the camp of
[2:03:54] the Philistines you know just his name
[2:03:57] you know when they said that oh we're
[2:03:58] going to have to go to Samson you know
[2:04:01] the the men got scared but now here he
[2:04:03] is his eyes are put out and he's being
[2:04:05] let LED around with the child you know
[2:04:08] the you know brother brandham says that
[2:04:09] that it was it was and the scripture
[2:04:11] says that it was actually A Feast for
[2:04:14] the god of deeon the fishon and that
[2:04:16] about how that they were going to take
[2:04:18] Samson for sport
[2:04:22] that they were going to take Samson for
[2:04:24] sport in front of the
[2:04:26] enemy and and he said that he you could
[2:04:29] Samson would sit there and just remember
[2:04:32] about what he would just sit there and
[2:04:34] think about all the times that he had
[2:04:37] think about all the times that he had
[2:04:38] defeated the enemy but now he was
[2:04:40] defeated by the same ones that he was
[2:04:43] meant to defeat and if we're not careful
[2:04:45] amen Satan would take our lives if we
[2:04:48] choose to give up if we choose not to if
[2:04:52] we choose just to stand there in
[2:04:54] self-pity and just stand there amen and
[2:04:57] let our prayer lives go to pot and left
[2:04:59] and let our services go to pot and let
[2:05:02] our let our times with the Lord go to
[2:05:04] pot and we just stand there amen Satan
[2:05:06] was waiting for the moment to to put
[2:05:09] Samson out in front of the Philistines
[2:05:11] you know the scripture says that all the
[2:05:13] Nobles had got together all the Lords
[2:05:16] had got together all the the men of
[2:05:18] prestige you know they' all come there
[2:05:20] he said it was 3,000 men just upon the
[2:05:22] roof that was there and they they were
[2:05:24] all sitting waiting for the main event
[2:05:27] now and that's the thing that that Satan
[2:05:29] so wants you Satan so desires to take
[2:05:34] your prayer life Satan so desires to
[2:05:37] take you singers to your song away that
[2:05:40] that you sing here you preachers he so
[2:05:43] desires to be able to take your gift and
[2:05:45] to be able to put it up on sport for all
[2:05:48] the world to see brother brandham says
[2:05:49] that it was it was it was like a trophy
[2:05:52] for the enemy that he could they could
[2:05:54] just sit there and say oh isn't this the
[2:05:56] mighty Samson isn't this the one that
[2:05:59] that we once feared and the one that we
[2:06:01] we were worried about and but yet the
[2:06:04] Deon Our God has given us the great
[2:06:06] Deliverance but but Jehovah was not
[2:06:09] going to stand by and watch his children
[2:06:12] just be used for sport he wasn't just
[2:06:14] going to stand by and watch and see the
[2:06:18] promise that he had given in Samson's
[2:06:20] life just to be able to go down into the
[2:06:22] gutter and I tell you here this evening
[2:06:25] God is not going to let one of his
[2:06:26] children amen fall and fall down and be
[2:06:30] used as Satan's amen trophy case
[2:06:32] somewhere but but yet when Samson was
[2:06:35] mealing there the you know the there's a
[2:06:38] little scripture right here and
[2:06:39] scripture says that in the middle of his
[2:06:41] mealing that he was he wasn't paying
[2:06:43] attention but his locks begin to grow
[2:06:46] back and the promise that was given to
[2:06:48] him begin to grow back and in the middle
[2:06:50] of your trial there's a seed that's
[2:06:52] laying down in the inside of your hearts
[2:06:55] that that wants God that needs God but
[2:06:57] yet there's something that's hindering
[2:06:58] you say you know the thing that Samson
[2:07:01] had to do was he had to come to full
[2:07:03] surrender in his life he had to come to
[2:07:05] a place where it was like lord it's not
[2:07:08] my strength it's not my ability but it's
[2:07:10] you that comes over me that I can that I
[2:07:13] can come and I could do these things and
[2:07:15] the scripture says when something else
[2:07:17] that I thought was unique that they
[2:07:19] didn't bring him out with with chains
[2:07:21] and they didn't bring him out with with
[2:07:23] an armored an armored parade but he had
[2:07:26] to be led by a lad he had to be led by a
[2:07:29] child and I begin to think about that
[2:07:31] about how that it's still just a
[2:07:33] childlike faith that has to be has to
[2:07:36] resonate in our heart that we have to be
[2:07:38] led amen by a by this gospel and he said
[2:07:42] you know you know Samson was like don't
[2:07:44] take me to a don't don't give me a sword
[2:07:46] don't do this don't do that but just
[2:07:48] take me to the place to the pillars
[2:07:51] where where this place is standing you
[2:07:53] know and he begin to stand and he begin
[2:07:55] to be led there his eyes are put out and
[2:07:57] you might be here this evening thinking
[2:07:59] Lord amen my my prayer life is gone my
[2:08:02] my song is gone my this is gone my that
[2:08:05] is gone but you know what you begin to
[2:08:07] empty out you know you begin to reach
[2:08:09] back and you begin to feel those locks
[2:08:12] those locks and the promises that God's
[2:08:14] given you amen because once God God
[2:08:16] gives a promise in your life he's
[2:08:18] obligated to it and he would he would
[2:08:20] much rather or he will he will make sure
[2:08:23] that his word will go through a mean in
[2:08:25] your life you know Samson you know he
[2:08:27] begin to go out there and he begin to
[2:08:29] come and he begin to say Lord once more
[2:08:32] and here this evening I my my prayer is
[2:08:35] is is that Lord once more I pray as
[2:08:38] we're closing at the end of this at the
[2:08:40] end of this uh H H Church age or the end
[2:08:43] of time that we're coming to and we are
[2:08:46] that Samson amen we are those people we
[2:08:49] are the individuals that God's called
[2:08:51] all that you know it doesn't matter what
[2:08:53] Walk of Life you've been in you may have
[2:08:55] been in church all your life or you
[2:08:57] might have just started yesterday but
[2:08:58] there's a reason that you sit in this
[2:09:00] building there's a reason that you sit
[2:09:02] here is not because as I said that you
[2:09:05] were just raised in church but yet
[2:09:06] there's a deep that's calling to the
[2:09:08] Deep there's something that that's
[2:09:10] drawing you to be here because it's the
[2:09:12] word that that that that that's so
[2:09:15] pulsating in your body that the desire
[2:09:18] for you to be here and I begin to think
[2:09:20] here about how that Samson he walks
[2:09:22] himself up to the pillars and he says
[2:09:24] Lord once more and and he and he begin
[2:09:27] to push on the pillars and the strength
[2:09:29] of God came back on him and you know we
[2:09:32] begin to think in our lives Lord what
[2:09:34] would it take to me to be able to get
[2:09:36] back into this position what would it
[2:09:38] take for me to get back in prayer what
[2:09:40] would it take amen for me to be get back
[2:09:42] to the place where where I first once
[2:09:44] was and where Lord your your power was
[2:09:47] radiant you know you have to be willing
[2:09:49] to die with your enemy you have to be
[2:09:51] willing to be able to say you know what
[2:09:54] Heen it doesn't matter what I what
[2:09:55] people think of me it doesn't matter
[2:09:57] what what the world's going to say it
[2:09:59] doesn't matter if they think I'm crazy
[2:10:01] it doesn't matter if they think you know
[2:10:03] that person is falling off their rocker
[2:10:05] but Lord once more in my life that I can
[2:10:08] destroy the enemy of my life for my
[2:10:10] children that I could destroy the enemy
[2:10:12] of my life amen amen for my community
[2:10:15] that I can live a prosperous life you
[2:10:18] know and Samson begin to get out there
[2:10:19] and he begin to push against the pillars
[2:10:22] and and and it said that in Samson's
[2:10:24] death that he killed more Philistines at
[2:10:26] his death than he did when he was alive
[2:10:28] and let that be said in a spiritual
[2:10:30] sense here here this evening amen if
[2:10:33] God's leading you to a rededication of
[2:10:35] your life if God is leading you to you
[2:10:38] know what I can do more for the kingdom
[2:10:40] I know I can do more I'm just hindered
[2:10:42] by this thing or I'm just hindered by
[2:10:44] that thing amen I say go to the pillars
[2:10:47] of your issue amen I say go to the
[2:10:49] pillars amen that's holding you back
[2:10:51] amen and begin to push against these
[2:10:54] things and you might say Lord amen my
[2:10:56] eyes my eyes of spiritual understanding
[2:10:59] have been put out for so long but Lord
[2:11:02] once more in my life let me face face to
[2:11:05] face with my enemy that I can come
[2:11:07] against it and I could I could utterly
[2:11:09] destroy
[2:11:10] him utterly destroy it utterly destroy
[2:11:15] it and that's what God's Desiring here
[2:11:16] this evening is that we could utterly
[2:11:19] destroy the enemy amen that we could
[2:11:21] come against it and we can put it down
[2:11:23] in the grave forever because we don't
[2:11:25] have much more time left here on Earth
[2:11:27] amen we're the last push where the last
[2:11:30] goal we're the last group of members
[2:11:32] amen and if there's something that's
[2:11:33] inside of your heart this evening amen
[2:11:35] that's screaming out Lord once more in
[2:11:38] my life let me not sing this song the
[2:11:40] same way that I have before but Lord
[2:11:43] hook me up to the jumper cables of your
[2:11:45] word and then let me come
[2:11:48] alive let me come alive
[2:11:52] CU a lot of times we sit on the bench a
[2:11:55] lot of times you know in our Christian
[2:11:57] walk we sit on the bench because we're
[2:12:00] worried about what this person thinks
[2:12:02] we're worried about what that person
[2:12:04] thinks we're worried about oh what if I
[2:12:06] do then I'm going to have to I'm G to
[2:12:08] have to you know give this up or I'm GNA
[2:12:10] have to give that up you know I'm G to
[2:12:12] have to put I'm going to have to lay my
[2:12:13] pride on the
[2:12:16] line Samson would have never been able
[2:12:18] to to to knock down the pillars of that
[2:12:20] building building had he had not ever
[2:12:22] been able to put everything on the line
[2:12:24] brother brandom says there in in in that
[2:12:26] same message oh Lord once more there in
[2:12:28] 63 you know he says you know that's the
[2:12:30] problem with the church
[2:12:32] today he they're not willing to put it
[2:12:35] all on the
[2:12:36] line is that our problem here this
[2:12:39] evening speaking for myself I ain't
[2:12:42] speak speaking at anybody I'm just just
[2:12:45] putting it all as Josh's
[2:12:46] fault Josh should have been preaching
[2:12:48] here this evening
[2:12:52] but is that is that where we're
[2:12:54] at you know the thing is is brother
[2:12:56] Brandon pointed out something pretty
[2:12:58] beautiful when he said that the
[2:13:00] framework of Samson was
[2:13:03] there the same Samson that killed all
[2:13:05] those Philistines the framework was
[2:13:07] there he said but the spirit of God
[2:13:10] wasn't there that was the problem and if
[2:13:12] we're careful we might have the
[2:13:14] framework
[2:13:16] together we might have the framework
[2:13:18] together where we sit on the front pews
[2:13:21] Boys on this side girls on this side we
[2:13:24] got our ushers and deacons in the back
[2:13:27] we got our certain musicians that come
[2:13:29] here in the church and you know we got
[2:13:31] the people that run the sound booth up
[2:13:33] there at the Crow's Nest you know
[2:13:34] everything's everything's all formed
[2:13:36] everything's put together you know all
[2:13:37] the things are put together on the
[2:13:39] screens and you know the music is just
[2:13:41] right but if we're not careful we'll
[2:13:43] have a
[2:13:45] framework we'll have a framework right
[2:13:47] here in the message church I'm not even
[2:13:49] talking good A lot of that message he's
[2:13:51] he's talking about the Pentecostals a
[2:13:53] lot of that message you know he's going
[2:13:54] on and he's talking about you know we
[2:13:56] have a frame but if we're not careful
[2:13:58] here in the message we'll have a
[2:13:59] framework we'll have a framework of you
[2:14:01] know what you know I showed up and I'm
[2:14:03] wearing I'm wearing my long hair and I
[2:14:05] got my skirts and you know and and this
[2:14:07] that and the other but we're missing the
[2:14:09] presence we're missing the spirit we're
[2:14:12] missing we're missing something that's
[2:14:14] the we're missing the life we we'll have
[2:14:17] the body here we God's got hands but yet
[2:14:20] there's no life behind it to where God
[2:14:22] can use it and that was the problem with
[2:14:24] Samson he got to the point where he was
[2:14:26] unusable and Lord let us not be unusable
[2:14:29] to God's spirit Lord let me not be
[2:14:32] unusable let let me not get to a place
[2:14:35] Lord don't let the enemy put my eyes out
[2:14:38] don't let me come to a place where I
[2:14:40] can't spiritually see what's going on
[2:14:42] because Samson had got to a place where
[2:14:44] he was he was he was he was he was with
[2:14:46] the Enemy he was with the devil in fact
[2:14:49] he was trying to marry Delilah I mean he
[2:14:51] was trying to get with Delilah and and
[2:14:54] Satan found his weakness and if we're
[2:14:56] laying in the lap of Delilah here this
[2:14:58] evening I I I let me persuade you that
[2:15:02] she will sell you
[2:15:04] out he will sell you young men
[2:15:07] out Amen to to to the things of this
[2:15:10] world he'll sell you out to to to
[2:15:13] entertainment he'll sell you out to amen
[2:15:16] trying to you know trying to take on
[2:15:18] your responsibilities and trying to move
[2:15:20] on with God but don't move further than
[2:15:22] God is don't move further you you know
[2:15:25] you ladies you know you're raising your
[2:15:27] children and you know and some of you
[2:15:29] are grandmas and taking you know and
[2:15:31] taking care of grand grandbabies and and
[2:15:34] you know all of us in our respective
[2:15:36] places and you be careful amen because
[2:15:38] Delila the enemy is seeking the source
[2:15:41] of your strength and if you come into
[2:15:43] church and there's and there's something
[2:15:45] that's that's in between you and his
[2:15:47] Spirit don't be too prideful to be able
[2:15:49] to be like Lord once more in my life I
[2:15:52] want you to reach back and be able to
[2:15:53] feel the promises of God because the god
[2:15:56] that saved you in the church service
[2:15:58] wherever you was wherever you'd been in
[2:16:01] your life the same God that met you
[2:16:03] there is in this building here this
[2:16:05] evening God had never giving up on
[2:16:07] Samson he was just waiting for Samson to
[2:16:09] get to a place God had not giving up on
[2:16:12] him he was waiting for him to get to a
[2:16:14] place and sometimes it takes trial
[2:16:18] sometimes it takes situation where old
[2:16:19] Samson he he had had to be grinding for
[2:16:22] the enemy to realize oh my goodness
[2:16:24] where am I at where have I been what
[2:16:27] have I been doing and he had realize
[2:16:29] that I took God for
[2:16:33] granted and that's where it is and God
[2:16:35] will sit there in your corner with dirty
[2:16:41] feet God will be willing to be taken for
[2:16:44] granted in your life I love how it was
[2:16:47] brother w a while back where he was he
[2:16:49] was giving the analogy about how that
[2:16:51] when you know you first come to God and
[2:16:53] God's God's your first and all of a
[2:16:56] sudden you come into your things come
[2:16:58] into your life and all of a sudden you
[2:17:00] have children or or or you know I'm just
[2:17:02] using things for example I'll let you
[2:17:03] place things wherever they are because
[2:17:05] you know I don't know I can't read into
[2:17:07] your life and things like that you know
[2:17:09] but all of a sudden God's first and then
[2:17:12] your children might come in and all of a
[2:17:13] sudden God takes second and then all of
[2:17:16] a sudden you get a job and you you're
[2:17:17] trying to move on with your career and
[2:17:19] and then all of a sudden God takes third
[2:17:21] you know and then and then you get a car
[2:17:23] or you get this or you know whatever it
[2:17:25] is and all of a sudden God takes fourth
[2:17:27] and then God's Fifth and God's Sixth and
[2:17:29] God seventh and the next thing you know
[2:17:30] he's looking over and he's just standing
[2:17:32] over there and he's like here I am but
[2:17:34] yet we're so busy going around doing
[2:17:36] things for the world and going around
[2:17:38] doing things that that profited us but
[2:17:40] yet we left the flower in the
[2:17:43] mountain all of a sudden all the things
[2:17:45] that we've been blessed with be be
[2:17:47] careful cuz it could be a curse cuz the
[2:17:50] more you have the more you got to take
[2:17:52] care of I learned that with with
[2:17:54] animals you know we we got 20-some
[2:17:58] chickens you know and I got some ducks
[2:18:02] dogs cats and I'm like man now I got to
[2:18:05] take care of all these things well Haven
[2:18:09] does you know but when when she's gone
[2:18:11] I'm like now I got to take care of all
[2:18:13] these things you know and the thing is
[2:18:16] is we think that all these things are
[2:18:17] great and we need things in our life you
[2:18:20] need a car to drive you better get a job
[2:18:23] you know you you know you you know you
[2:18:25] need you know you you you girls got to
[2:18:27] do your things you know the what you
[2:18:29] know whatever girls do you know they do
[2:18:32] the they do their things you know I mean
[2:18:34] I was just looking in my little notebook
[2:18:36] that I had here and every single page of
[2:18:38] my 70 page little notebook has got some
[2:18:40] flower with a name written on it flower
[2:18:43] with a name written I'm like you just
[2:18:44] had all this time to flip through all
[2:18:46] these pages and just write their name
[2:18:47] and flowers around
[2:18:49] it you know and if we're not careful we
[2:18:52] begin to doodle in
[2:18:54] life we have no
[2:18:56] purpose we as our brother was saying you
[2:18:59] know you take you take you know your
[2:19:01] quiet time and the time that you could
[2:19:02] be using with the Lord and how many
[2:19:04] times have we pushed on our pushed on
[2:19:07] turned on our our message app and how
[2:19:09] many times have we listened to a message
[2:19:11] or you know get on get on and and and
[2:19:13] you know read our Bible or do these
[2:19:15] other things but yet we lay in the lap
[2:19:17] of Delilah as if nothing's fixing to
[2:19:19] happen she's sapping you of your
[2:19:22] strength she's sapping you of your of
[2:19:25] your ability to be able to see what's
[2:19:27] going on because there's a lot of things
[2:19:28] that are going on in this world that the
[2:19:30] message has spiritual eyes on we know
[2:19:33] where this we know what's going to
[2:19:34] happen with the money in the United
[2:19:35] States we know that a Superman's coming
[2:19:38] you know we know you know we know where
[2:19:40] the gold really is you know I just
[2:19:41] thought it was pretty interesting you
[2:19:43] know the president's like I'm going to
[2:19:44] go see the gold and Mr musk he's like
[2:19:46] yeah me too and I'm like man I wonder if
[2:19:49] it's really there
[2:19:51] I wonder I wonder if it really is there
[2:19:54] I wonder if if if the Vatican doesn't
[2:19:56] already have it these are things that we
[2:19:57] have but if we just go through with our
[2:19:59] eyes blinded we won't catch it when it
[2:20:01] comes by we won't catch the where we're
[2:20:03] sitting at in the end times we won't
[2:20:05] catch where we're at you know where
[2:20:06] we've been placed here at this time to
[2:20:08] see where it's
[2:20:11] at once more Lauren and if I could wind
[2:20:15] it down you know if I could wind it down
[2:20:18] to this once more Lord in my life
[2:20:21] there's been things that's been
[2:20:22] hindering us from the spirit of the Lord
[2:20:23] when it comes in the services or there's
[2:20:26] something that's been hindering us in
[2:20:27] our life to get closer to the God you
[2:20:29] know Lord you know if we've been
[2:20:31] grinding at the Mill at the Mill of the
[2:20:34] enemy you know it takes those
[2:20:38] moments to realize how good we actually
[2:20:41] had
[2:20:42] it you know W without
[2:20:44] suffering you know we don't we're not
[2:20:47] able to see you know we don't really see
[2:20:50] where God God you know took us
[2:20:52] from where we're at what we're doing
[2:20:56] until all of a sudden God's begins to
[2:20:58] shake the boat shake the boat a little
[2:21:00] bit and then we realize that Lord you
[2:21:02] know
[2:21:02] what I had it better with you we're like
[2:21:06] the
[2:21:07] prodal in our Spirits we we can do that
[2:21:10] I know we all have our wings and our
[2:21:12] little Halos on and stuff like that and
[2:21:14] I you know what you guys are angels you
[2:21:16] know you guys are angels but yet all of
[2:21:19] a sudden it takes these moments where
[2:21:21] things start happening in our lives
[2:21:23] where we realize you know what I had it
[2:21:25] better in the presence of the
[2:21:27] Lord I had it better in the presence of
[2:21:29] the Lord than football and basketball
[2:21:31] and I had it in the presence of the Lord
[2:21:33] because you know I learned a long time
[2:21:34] ago that those athletes can care less
[2:21:36] who we are they can care less who we are
[2:21:39] as long as we just keep buying tickets
[2:21:41] you know as long as we keep getting on
[2:21:43] their little things and getting on there
[2:21:45] you know what there's a lot of things
[2:21:46] that we do they can care less who we are
[2:21:48] amen they just want to sap your time and
[2:21:50] they just want to sap your energy and
[2:21:51] they just want to I mean sap your funds
[2:21:53] and be able to be able to say Hey you
[2:21:55] know you know uh you know we've got this
[2:21:57] person or we've got that person but you
[2:21:59] know what the Lord is looking for that
[2:22:02] point for your return the Lord is
[2:22:05] looking for you to be able to say you
[2:22:07] know what you know Lord I'm tired of
[2:22:09] grinding at the I'm tired of working for
[2:22:12] the enemy I'm tired of I'm tired of just
[2:22:14] standing here and and being a mockery
[2:22:17] for the devil because you know a lot of
[2:22:19] us who can look back in our lives and we
[2:22:21] could say where where where we was at
[2:22:23] the peak of our experience and where we
[2:22:25] are now you know hey you might be at the
[2:22:27] peak of your experience I don't know you
[2:22:29] know I don't know these things but you
[2:22:30] could be sitting here and looking at it
[2:22:32] and Satan sitting there reminding you of
[2:22:34] all the uh all the times and prayer that
[2:22:37] you had now look at you all the all the
[2:22:39] times you know that when you were
[2:22:40] reading the word and all of a sudden the
[2:22:42] word would just come fresh to you and he
[2:22:44] begins to point these things out and say
[2:22:46] you know look at and see where you're at
[2:22:47] now and all but there's still something
[2:22:49] in you that's crying out that's like
[2:22:52] Lord amen I don't belong in this state
[2:22:55] spiritually in my life I don't belong in
[2:22:57] this place where where I'm at but Lord
[2:23:00] Lord just take me to the pillars I mean
[2:23:02] because you got to get fed up that's the
[2:23:05] thing is you got to get you got to get
[2:23:07] fed up where you're at in your life you
[2:23:08] got to get fed up where you at in your

[2:23:29] know but but but you feel dragged down
[2:23:31] in your experience but yet God's telling
[2:23:33] you I'm still here God's telling you you
[2:23:36] know I could still visit you in your
[2:23:38] prayer life I could still visit you in

[2:23:52] Enemy you know and that's one of my

[3:03:22] amen isn't he
[3:03:28] wonderful glory to
[3:03:31] God enjoyed the service tonight I
[3:03:33] thought both the messages went right
[3:03:35] along with one another brother Harry
[3:03:38] amen you brother Mike
[3:03:45] you the Lord knows what he wants to say
[3:03:48] and and I believe mediocrity is is the
[3:03:54] greatest is the greatest
[3:03:58] destroyer and sapper of
[3:04:01] power than anything else
[3:04:07] mediocrity and um I I
[3:04:13] heard I I heard uh musk say something
[3:04:18] the other day that that is stuck with
[3:04:23] me talking about the federal
[3:04:26] government he says when you when you
[3:04:29] lack two things competence and
[3:04:34] [Music]
[3:04:37] caring
[3:04:40] then uh the government's bound to
[3:04:43] fall he said you got to have
[3:04:46] confidence and you've got I have people
[3:04:48] that care about what they're
[3:04:53] doing and he used he used the
[3:04:55] illustration of whoever had signed the
[3:04:59] the deal for the $5 billion Air Force
[3:05:04] One they you signed the
[3:05:07] contract and nego and and but when Trump
[3:05:10] come in he says listen we ain't paying
[3:05:13] no $5 billion for that if you want to
[3:05:15] build it for us we're going to give you
[3:05:18] a 1.7 billion for
[3:05:22] that and of course Boeing they agreed to
[3:05:26] it
[3:05:27] and he said now that's someone who cares
[3:05:31] what they're doing with your
[3:05:34] money and I thought there is a competent
[3:05:39] bride who
[3:05:41] cares about the Master's
[3:05:44] [Music]
[3:05:46] business we
[3:05:48] care about making
[3:05:50] sure that his word is fulfilled on Earth
[3:05:55] as it is in
[3:05:57] heaven we care can you say Amen did you
[3:06:01] know that brother brandham said that
[3:06:05] compassion is doing the will of the
[3:06:09] father brother brandham is saying the
[3:06:11] same thing that that I heard musk say
[3:06:13] the other day not not trying to justify
[3:06:16] musk I'm
[3:06:18] I I'm I'm not a I'm not into politics
[3:06:20] one way or the other I but if but I tell
[3:06:24] you what they've exposed a lot of lot of
[3:06:27] waste in the government haven't they
[3:06:29] been a lot of waste in the church been a
[3:06:31] lot of waste in there's been just a lot
[3:06:34] of
[3:06:35] waste but brother brandham said and and
[3:06:38] and I looked it up compassion and he
[3:06:40] said it many
[3:06:42] times
[3:06:44] compassion is doing the will
[3:06:48] of the father
[3:06:50] caring what he
[3:06:53] thinks caring about what his
[3:06:57] will on Earth is I thought that was good
[3:07:02] I
[3:07:03] want that kind of caring to know what he
[3:07:09] wants done and let me carry it out to
[3:07:14] the
[3:07:16] letter is there any competent folks in
[3:07:19] the bride is there any caring folks in
[3:07:21] the bride I'd say yes we are here and we
[3:07:27] care about the father's business about
[3:07:29] our Lord's business amen and so we
[3:07:34] appreciate the word of the lord we
[3:07:37] appreciate the message tonight and I
[3:07:40] would say let's not let this these
[3:07:42] messages just
[3:07:45] go and and uh
[3:07:48] and just forget about it by the time we
[3:07:52] leave but Lord help me help me to take
[3:07:57] this word and hold it very dear to my
[3:08:01] heart we've got Youth Camp that's coming
