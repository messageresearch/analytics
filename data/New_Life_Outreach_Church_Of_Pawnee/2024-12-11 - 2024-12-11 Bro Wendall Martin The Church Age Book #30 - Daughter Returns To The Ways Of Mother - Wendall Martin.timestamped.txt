[22:39] we're we're thankful he still has some
[22:41] fluid on his lungs um and they're trying
[22:45] to get that off um but uh getting him uh
[22:51] to where he can move around a little bit

[22:59] Dad how many appreciates Brother Martin
[23:02] we sure
[23:03] do thank the Lord for Dad let's look
[23:07] here at Revelations 3 the first
[23:12] chapter and unto the angel of the Church
[23:14] of Sardis write these things saith he
[23:18] that hath
[23:20] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[23:23] I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name
[23:27] that thou livest and are dead Be
[23:31] watchful and strengthen the things which
[23:34] remain that are ready to die for I have
[23:38] not found thy works perfect before the
[23:41] Lord or before god let's go to the Lord
[23:44] in prayer
[23:45] father we thank you for your word and we
[23:48] thank you for everything that it means
[23:51] to us it's our
[23:54] inheritance it's our stay it's Lord Lord
[23:58] you you've given us these things that as
[24:03] we put on the the the church page today
[24:08] keeping our Doctrine simple and and I
[24:11] believe brother brandham always done
[24:13] that just always believe the
[24:15] Bible and Lord if we could do that in
[24:18] every area of Our Lives what a what a
[24:21] Powerhouse the church really truly
[24:24] is that Lord but we we have to believe
[24:28] your word word and we're asking Lord
[24:30] that this would be more than just a
[24:32] reading but we're asking Lord that
[24:34] divine revelation would would infiltrate
[24:38] our souls and Lord let us see Lord the
[24:43] the workings of hell and also the
[24:46] workings of God we love you Lord we
[24:49] thank you for your words help us tonight
[24:51] now in Jesus name we pray can the church
[24:55] say
[24:56] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[24:59] seated here
[25:02] tonight now we're going to um we're
[25:05] going to be reading uh starting here at
[25:08] page uh
[25:11] 254 and we're going to go down to the
[25:13] first
[25:14] paragraph so uh how many how many
[25:17] enjoyed the um the the film on um on
[25:22] Sunday
[25:26] night and um
[25:29] you know we uh with with the
[25:32] film uh we could see such what a what a
[25:36] mighty thing uh it was and how that
[25:41] God um raised up a Luther to
[25:46] um to to bring about a
[25:49] Reformation but um and it and it truly
[25:53] was glorious but as we have just read
[25:56] Amen in the in the scriptures
[25:59] that that um they were already even
[26:02] though God done great things amen it
[26:06] says you have a name that you live and
[26:09] are dead Be watchful and strengthen the
[26:11] things that remain that are ready to die
[26:15] and so we're going to see that the that
[26:19] that the Revival and death the cycle of
[26:24] Revival and death has has been
[26:27] throughout all of the churches been down
[26:29] through the church ages God would send a
[26:32] Revival and we're fixing to go in
[26:33] through this here tonight God sent a
[26:36] Martin Luther amen but it didn't take
[26:40] long until they
[26:41] denominated around what what God had
[26:45] done and as soon as they denominate they
[26:49] lose the life of God and and I and and
[26:52] that is and and the cycles of Revival
[26:55] and death happens in our our personal
[26:59] walks too how many how many can say Amen
[27:01] to that that God can send a Revival and
[27:04] if we're not careful we'll denominate
[27:07] around that now we we we don't call it
[27:09] denominate because we're just
[27:10] individuals but we think we've got it
[27:12] all down pat and we lose our sincerity
[27:16] and we're we're we're no longer Walking
[27:19] with God we're thankful for what God has
[27:21] blessed us with and we sort of we sort
[27:23] of lay ourselves or put ourselves in
[27:27] that position
[27:29] to uh and and and God wants to keep
[27:32] right on moving on with us and taking us
[27:36] on in a a a closer walk with us in other
[27:39] words we never come to a standstill we
[27:42] must never in our personal walk come to
[27:46] a standstill Lord let me always continue
[27:50] to grow let your spirit always lead me
[27:53] on Amen so as as we read we we read last
[27:58] week of of um Martin Luther and and what
[28:01] God had done through
[28:03] him and what the age created now let us
[28:08] look now we're going to try to read uh
[28:10] 10 pages tonight so we're going to start
[28:12] at 10:54 or 254 and we're going to try
[28:15] to make it to 264 if we don't make it
[28:18] there then that's fine too but um if we
[28:21] did it would be a perfect stopping point
[28:23] so that the next week we can get into
[28:25] the names and um which I really love I I
[28:28] love that portion of the church age book
[28:31] and uh listen I believe in
[28:32] predestination folks I believe that
[28:35] there are some names that are put on
[28:36] that Lamb's Book of Life that that
[28:39] that'll never come off and then there
[28:41] we're going to find out next week amen
[28:43] that there are some names that are put
[28:45] on the book of life that will come off
[28:47] then there's other names that are on
[28:49] that that that have never been put on
[28:51] The Book of Life and so um it'll be it's
[28:55] it'll be a wonderful teaching and that
[28:57] will probably take a couple of um
[29:00] Wednesday nights on that because he
[29:01] deals a lot with it all right let's
[29:03] let's start in spite of Luther's
[29:06] constant teaching against outside
[29:09] interference in the local church matters
[29:12] he was not able to clear men's minds of
[29:15] the bishop Archbishop concept of church
[29:18] government thus the church took one step
[29:21] in the right direction but re but still
[29:24] remain Shackled so in short order she
[29:27] was again
[29:28] imprisoned in the same dungeon whence
[29:32] she had attempted to escape steal the
[29:34] cup of the Abominable Works was not yet
[29:37] full not only did Luther through poor
[29:40] judgment in sight to battle and thereby
[29:43] caused the death of multitudes but
[29:46] zwingli's party persecuted unto prison
[29:49] The Godly Dr
[29:51] Hub and though it did not commit him to
[29:53] the stake it was actually responsible in
[29:56] great measure for his eventual death
[29:58] death by fire and Calvin did no less for
[30:01] he demanded the arrest of Serv uh cetus
[30:05] who had seen and taught the Oneness of
[30:07] the godhead the state then tried him or
[30:09] tried this brother and to Calvin's
[30:11] dismay he was burnt at the stake if
[30:14] there was ever a time of denominational
[30:17] Zeal it was at this tragic time the
[30:20] words of cinius describe much of this
[30:24] era commus wrote the one thing needful
[30:27] he compares the world to the Labyrinth
[30:30] uh
[30:31] rinth and shows uh that the way out is
[30:35] by leaving what is needless and choosing
[30:38] the one thing needful Christ the great
[30:42] number of teachers he says is the reason
[30:45] the multitudes of
[30:47] sexs um for which we shall soon have no
[30:50] names left each Church reckons itself as
[30:54] the true one or at least as the purest
[30:57] truest part of it while among themselves
[31:00] they persecute each other with the
[31:03] bitterest hatred no reconciliation is to
[31:06] be hoped for between them they meet
[31:09] enmity with ir uh reconcilable enmity
[31:13] out of the Bible they forg their
[31:15] different Creeds these are their
[31:16] fortresses and bull Works behind which
[31:20] they entrench themselves and resist all
[31:23] attacks you realize that what Satan does
[31:25] he does that he's doing this in a as a
[31:29] church against church denomination
[31:30] against denomination but it's the same
[31:32] Spirit that'll work with individuals
[31:35] against one another you know hurt
[31:37] feelings and then Satan will entrench
[31:39] one way or another and and we'll we'll
[31:41] get all of our reasons together and the
[31:43] other side will get all their reasons
[31:45] together and and instead of just letting
[31:49] Christ uh uh uh instead of us being a
[31:53] Brotherhood it's it's it's lobbing at
[31:55] one another instead of just walking in
[31:58] the harmony of of love the beautiful
[32:01] Harmony of love that God gives us amen
[32:03] so so we'll see that here in this area
[32:06] because they were the same they were the
[32:08] same but each were trying to pull their
[32:11] own Direction because there was a great
[32:14] big pull away now you got to remember
[32:16] the anointing of the day brought them
[32:19] out the people were seeing the the the
[32:24] the uh fault of the Roman Catholic
[32:27] Church and they were leaving it in
[32:30] droves and so now here's these teachers
[32:34] looking for ways to to to pull their
[32:38] Direction and and before you know it we
[32:41] had them pulling this way they couldn't
[32:42] agree with Luther on this and they
[32:44] couldn't agree with this one and
[32:45] couldn't agree with that and before you
[32:46] know what we had we we had multiple
[32:51] denominations that were just like the
[32:53] mama and they were persecuting each
[32:56] other just like the Catholic church was
[32:59] them as they were coming out it's it's
[33:02] an incredible thing and they couldn't
[33:04] they couldn't catch uh uh what it is and
[33:07] so u i I just think that it's it's it's
[33:10] it's part of who we are and that's why
[33:12] we should strive every day God fill me
[33:15] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost let
[33:17] your Holy Spirit forever more live in me
[33:21] and through me amen it says now out of
[33:25] the Bible they forged their different
[33:26] Creeds and these are their fortresses
[33:28] and bullworks behind which they entrench
[33:31] themselves and resist all attacks I will
[33:33] not say that these confessions of faith
[33:35] for we can admit in most cases that they
[33:38] are so are bad in themselves they be uh
[33:43] they become so however in that they feed
[33:45] the fire of enmity only by putting them
[33:49] away altogether would it be possible to
[33:53] set uh to set to work on healing the
[33:56] wounds of the church to this Labyrinth
[33:59] of sex and various confessions another
[34:02] belongs the love of
[34:03] disputation what is attained by it has
[34:07] has a single learned Strife ever been
[34:10] settled never their number has only been
[34:14] increased Satan is the greatest sophist
[34:18] he has never been overcome uh in Strife
[34:22] of words in Divine service the words of
[34:25] men are usually heard more than the word
[34:28] of God each one Chatters as he pleases
[34:30] or kills Time by learning dis uh
[34:34] disquisitions and disproving the views
[34:36] of others of the new birth and how a man
[34:40] must be changed into the likeness of
[34:42] Christ to become partakers of the divine
[34:44] nature second Peter 1 and4 scarcely
[34:47] anything is said of the power of the
[34:51] keys the church has almost lost the
[34:53] power of binding only the power of
[34:56] loosening remains the sacraments given
[34:59] as symbols of unity of love and of our
[35:02] life in Christ have been the made the
[35:06] occasion of the bitterest conflict a a
[35:09] cause of mutual hatred a center of
[35:12] sectarianism in short Christendom has
[35:14] become a
[35:16] labyrinth the faith has been split into
[35:18] a thousand little Parts you are made a
[35:21] heretic if there is one of them you do
[35:24] not accept what can help only the one
[35:28] thing needful return to Christ looking
[35:32] to Christ as the only leader and walking
[35:35] in his footsteps setting aside all other
[35:38] ways until we all reach the goal and
[35:41] have come to the unity of the faith
[35:43] Ephesians
[35:44] 4:13 as the Heavenly Master Built
[35:47] everything on the ground of scriptures
[35:50] so should we leave all
[35:52] particularities of our special
[35:54] confessions and be satisfied with the
[35:57] revealed word of God which belongs to us
[36:00] all with the Bible in our hands we
[36:03] should cry I believe what God has
[36:06] revealed in this book I will obediently
[36:09] keep his commands I hope for that which
[36:12] he has promised Christians give ear
[36:16] there's only one life but death comes to
[36:19] us in a thousand forms there's only one
[36:22] Christ but thousands Antichrist so thou
[36:26] knowest oh Christendom
[36:28] what is uh the one thing needful either
[36:31] thou turnest back to Christ or thou
[36:34] goest to destruction like the Antichrist
[36:37] if Thou Art wise and wil live follow the
[36:40] leader of life but you Christians
[36:43] rejoice in your being caught up hear the
[36:47] words of your heavenly leader come unto
[36:49] me answer with one voice even so we come
[36:54] how many can say Amen to that now I just
[36:58] said in that era in this era gave
[37:01] tremendous growth to the denominational
[37:03] Spirit if the Christian attitude or if
[37:06] the Corinth attitude of I am of Paul I
[37:09] of sephus was ever exhibited it was now
[37:13] there were the Lutheran hites the Zang
[37:16] zwing party Etc such fragmentation of
[37:19] the body was deplorable they were living
[37:23] a name but were dead certainly they were
[37:26] dead they they died the minute they
[37:28] organized the great groups organized and
[37:32] tied themselves in matrimony to the
[37:34] state that did it they were finished
[37:37] here were those Lutheran who had
[37:40] criticized the Roman Church they knew
[37:43] the unrighteousness of political and
[37:45] spiritual unions yet Luther as when
[37:48] Peter was overbalanced by the judaizers
[37:53] judees went right ahead and made the
[37:56] state in uh made the state instead of
[37:59] God the defender of Faith this is the
[38:01] first denomination of repute that came
[38:04] out of the Harlot but when Luther died
[38:07] it was not long until it had a hierarchy
[38:11] like the one it had fought this move of
[38:14] God by the time the second generation
[38:16] come along was right under back under
[38:19] the wing of her mother she had uh she
[38:22] had gone back and did not even know it
[38:25] they had taken on their own name name
[38:28] above his name they were living their
[38:30] own name too all the denominations are
[38:34] doing the very same very thing today
[38:38] that they are living their own name and
[38:40] not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:43] that's that is easily seen for every
[38:46] church is known by the way it worships
[38:48] but none are known by the power of God
[38:52] there's your test I want you to notice
[38:54] right there that this era did did not
[38:57] have the signs and wonders amongst them
[39:00] they gave up the power of God for the
[39:03] power of the state they clung to their
[39:06] own name they made their names great it
[39:09] was the old Spirit of getting everyone
[39:11] into its fold today the Baptists want
[39:14] the Methodist to come over to the
[39:16] Baptist the methodists are out to
[39:18] proelite the Presbyterians the
[39:20] Pentecostals want them all each claims
[39:23] to offer the most and to hold out the
[39:25] greatest hopes a sword of Door to Heaven
[39:28] or at least the way of a more abundant
[39:31] entrance how tragic it all is this
[39:35] denominational Spirit has made all the
[39:38] denominations write their manuals teach
[39:41] their Creeds set up their office offices
[39:45] and church governments and then each
[39:47] claims that she and she alone truly
[39:49] speaks for God as she is the best
[39:52] qualified now if that isn't exactly what
[39:55] the pope and the Roman Church are doing
[39:58] they are right back there with their
[40:00] mother the Harlot and don't know it in
[40:04] closing our comments on this verse thou
[40:07] has a name thou livest and are dead I
[40:11] cannot impress upon you too strongly
[40:13] that this age though it brought the
[40:16] reformation and was most sternly rebuked
[40:19] by God instead of being praised because
[40:22] it sold the seed of
[40:25] denomination that was organ that or
[40:27] organized right back to the Harlot after
[40:30] God had opened the door of escape and
[40:33] when the move away from the Catholic
[40:34] Church took place it was not truly
[40:37] spiritual as a whole but more
[40:41] political most of the people took up
[40:43] their protestantism because as I have
[40:45] stated they hated the Roman system of
[40:48] political and financial bondage thus
[40:50] instead of this being a great spiritual
[40:53] move with all the earmarks of the Holy
[40:55] Spirit influence
[40:57] as when God used purely uh as as when
[41:01] God used purely spiritual means to
[41:03] accomplish his ends at Pentecost it was
[41:06] indeed a work wherein the wrath of man
[41:08] praised God and the results paralleled
[41:12] the history of Israel when she left e
[41:14] Egypt and wandered in the desert not
[41:17] making it to the canaan's
[41:19] land however much was accomplished in
[41:22] that where the Yoke of Rome was even
[41:26] partly broken men could now receive the
[41:28] word of God and yield to the influence
[41:31] of the spirit without such great fear as
[41:35] forly this opened the door to the great
[41:37] missionary age that followed the Jezebel
[41:41] of
[41:42] thyra was in no mood to give up her hold
[41:45] upon the people and thus we see her
[41:48] daughter aaliah raise her head in the
[41:52] sardian age at with the hopes that she
[41:55] would be able to strangle the true seed
[41:58] by her schemes of organization you know
[42:01] aren't you glad for a
[42:02] prophet I'm so glad for the for this for
[42:05] a a prophet that could just bring these
[42:07] things out so beautifully and clearly
[42:11] the warning Revelations 3 and 2 Be
[42:14] watchful and strengthen the things which
[42:17] remain for they are ready to die for I
[42:21] have not found thy works perfect before
[42:23] God I wish it could be said that the
[42:26] sergeant Ian Church age in the sardian
[42:29] age was a restoration instead of a
[42:32] Reformation I cannot say that the word
[42:35] does not call it a
[42:37] restoration but certainly calls it a
[42:40] Reformation had it been a restoration
[42:43] the age would have had another
[42:45] Pentecostal age but it was not the best
[42:49] it that can be said of it was strengthen
[42:53] that which remains that is ready to die
[42:57] there was something missing my yes there
[43:00] was certainly there certainly was this
[43:03] age had
[43:04] justification but it had missed
[43:06] sanctification and the baptism with the
[43:08] Holy Ghost that is what God's original
[43:12] plan was that was what they had at
[43:15] Pentecost they were Justified they were
[43:18] Sanctified and were filled with the Holy
[43:21] Ghost why listen to me the reason for
[43:24] being justified and Sanctified is to the
[43:27] end that you might be baptized with the
[43:29] Holy Ghost that is a reason that there
[43:33] is a church it is the temple filled with
[43:37] God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit
[43:42] that was in Jesus while he was here on
[43:44] Earth causing him to do the mighty Works
[43:47] which he
[43:48] did came back upon the church at
[43:51] Pentecost so that they could work The
[43:53] Works he did so that they did The Works
[43:56] he did
[43:57] this age did not have those works all
[44:00] they had the written word but not the
[44:02] revealed word this was the Reformation
[44:05] period but fear not little flock God
[44:08] says I will restore Hallelujah and this
[44:12] reform was going to be the the start of
[44:15] it he was going to according to to his
[44:18] promise take the church back uh from the
[44:22] uh depths of Satan in the dark ages to
[44:25] the depths of God that they had at
[44:28] Pentecost and in the very and the few
[44:31] first few years of the existence of the
[44:33] church now be careful and get this it
[44:36] says in the second verse that I have
[44:38] read for I have not found thy works
[44:42] perfect before God do you know what the
[44:44] meaning of not perfect really is it is
[44:47] unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled
[44:51] age it was just the starting of getting
[44:54] back that's why I said the Bible called
[44:57] it Reformation not
[45:00] restoration it had started out in the
[45:03] doctrine of
[45:04] justification which meant salvation was
[45:06] all of God oh how Luther preached the
[45:10] sovereignty of God and election he knew
[45:13] it was all Grace he separated the church
[45:16] from the rule of by the
[45:19] ecclesiastical uh hierarchy he tore down
[45:22] the idols he cast out the confessions to
[45:25] the priest he denounced the Pope
[45:27] it was wonderfully good as he started
[45:30] but God has said 1500 years before
[45:33] Luther you're going to start things but
[45:36] your age uh will see it all unfulfilled
[45:39] I'm leaving that to later hallelujah our
[45:43] god reth he knows the end from the
[45:46] beginning yes Luther was his messenger
[45:50] he didn't look like it as we examine the
[45:52] flaws but there was a man called Jonah
[45:55] he had flaws in his too he was a prophet
[45:59] though you and I might not want to say
[46:01] so on the Bas of basis of how he acted
[46:05] but God knows them that are his and he
[46:07] has his way just as he did with Jonah he
[46:11] had his way with Luther in that age and
[46:13] he will have his way until the
[46:16] consummation praise the Lord now this is
[46:20] an
[46:21] unfulfilled this was an unfulfilled age
[46:24] it was an age of
[46:25] reformation but that is how God wanted
[46:28] it I want to illustrate to you the way
[46:31] that I did to a very wonderful Lutheran
[46:33] brother who is a president of a very
[46:36] fine Seminary out west I had been
[46:40] invited to his place to have dinner with
[46:42] him and to speak with him concerning the
[46:45] Holy Spirit he was puzzled about many
[46:47] things and he said to me what have the
[46:50] Lutheran God I said well you have
[46:54] Christ he said we want the Holy Ghost do
[46:57] you think we've got it I said
[46:59] potentially you are believing unto it he
[47:02] said what do you mean potentially we are
[47:06] hungry for God we read a book on
[47:08] Pentecost and the gifts of the Spirit so
[47:10] some of us flew out to California to see
[47:12] the author when we got there he told us
[47:15] that though he had written the book he
[47:18] did not have the gifts now when he when
[47:21] we saw the operations of gifts in your
[47:23] ministry we wanted to talk to you for
[47:25] you must know something about them now
[47:28] this brother Seminary is out in the
[47:30] country and surrounded by many acres of
[47:32] Farmland on which the students can work
[47:35] and thereby pay their way through
[47:37] college he also has factories along the
[47:40] way along with the farm to give added
[47:43] employment so using his fields to
[47:46] illustrate my case I said once there was
[47:49] a man who went forth on his own ground
[47:51] to plant a field of corn he pulled up
[47:54] the stumps and cleared off the rocks and
[47:57] plowed and disced it and and then uh
[48:00] planted his
[48:02] corn each morning he looked across the
[48:05] field but one morning instead of barren
[48:08] ground he saw myriads of little blades
[48:10] coming up and he said praise God for my
[48:13] Field of Corn I then asked did the man
[48:17] have corn he said well in one way he did
[48:22] I said potentially yes and that was you
[48:26] Lutheran in the Reformation putting
[48:28] forth your blade see the corn began to
[48:32] grow after it rotted in the ground
[48:34] during the Dark Ages after several
[48:37] joints were were fine large stocks and
[48:40] one day a tassel of silk appeared then
[48:44] and that tassel of silk looked down at
[48:46] the blades and said you old formal
[48:49] Lutheran haven't anything look at us
[48:52] we're the Breeders the great
[48:54] missionaries our day is the missionary
[48:57] era that and that tassel age was the
[49:00] Wesleyan age and they were the greatest
[49:02] missionaries and even excelled us in our
[49:05] age what did that age do it scattered
[49:09] like pollen in the breeze now what is
[49:12] the next step logically we think that is
[49:15] the actual forming of the harvesting of
[49:17] the grain the completed cycle but not so
[49:22] there is another stage that stage is
[49:24] when the husk or chaff is is formed to
[49:27] cover cover the seed that is exactly
[49:31] what happened in this spiritual cycle at
[49:34] the turn of the 20th century in the
[49:36] start of the lsan age there was
[49:39] widespread belief the Holy Ghost was
[49:41] falling exactly as he did at Pentecost
[49:45] people were talking in tongues claiming
[49:48] the B to be baptized of the Holy Ghost
[49:50] with the evidence of speaking in tongues
[49:53] but I have walked in the grain Fields
[49:55] many times and there in the late
[49:57] summer I have plucked the heads of Wheat
[50:01] and rubbed them in my hand to get some
[50:03] grain when to my surprise there wasn't
[50:06] any corn of wheat in that chaff though
[50:09] indeed it surely looked as if wheat were
[50:13] there this is a perfect picture of the
[50:15] so-called Pentecostal
[50:17] move this and that this is a proven fact
[50:21] is found in uh that these people
[50:24] organized on a Doctrine
[50:27] bound themselves right back as did
[50:29] organization ahead of them proving that
[50:32] instead of being the real seed they were
[50:34] the chaff or the protecting cover for
[50:37] the wheat seed which should come this
[50:41] chaff stage was the danger period when
[50:44] Jesus spoke that Jesus spoke of in
[50:47] Matthew
[50:48] 24:24 deceiving the very elect if it
[50:51] were Possible Oh man felt that this husk
[50:55] this so-called Pentecostal age was the
[50:58] true seed but it proved to be just the
[51:02] carrier uh to carry the life over into
[51:05] the age in which the true restoration
[51:08] comes when the bride when the wheat
[51:10] bride is manifested in the power spoken
[51:13] by Ezekiel 47:
[51:16] 2:5 then he brought me out of the way of
[51:18] the gate northward and led me about the
[51:21] way without unto the utter gate by the
[51:25] way which lookth Eastward
[51:27] and behold there ran out waters on the
[51:29] right side and the man that had the lion
[51:31] in his hand went forth Eastward and he
[51:34] measured a cubic a thousand cubits and
[51:37] he brought me through the waters and the
[51:38] waters were to the ankles and again he
[51:41] measured a thousand and brought me
[51:42] through the waters the waters were to
[51:44] the knees and again he measured a
[51:46] thousand and brought me through the
[51:48] waters were to the loins afterwards he
[51:51] measured a thousand and it was a river
[51:53] that I could not pass over for the
[51:55] waters were risen
[51:57] Waters to swim in a river that could not
[51:59] be passed
[52:01] over and the way that it was done was by
[52:05] God's perfect will and programming the
[52:08] Lutheran had the Holy Ghost potentially
[52:11] under
[52:12] justification Methodist had it
[52:14] potentially under sanctification and
[52:16] today it is brought back a restoration
[52:19] the Holy Ghost is
[52:21] here Be watchful and strengthen the
[52:24] things which remain that are ready to
[52:27] die now the ideas expressed in in the
[52:30] two words watchful and strengthen are
[52:32] are
[52:34] these to watch contains not only the
[52:38] idea of being awake but to be alert to
[52:42] be otherwise insinuates danger and loss
[52:45] to strengthen means more than to just
[52:48] give strength it means to fix and
[52:51] establish for
[52:52] permanency these two commands refer to
[52:55] what is left of the truth which itself
[52:59] is ready or about to die these
[53:03] expressions or this expression of the
[53:05] spirit comes before me as an
[53:07] illustration a group of slaves in total
[53:11] bondage physically and morally have
[53:14] risen up and escaped their captors
[53:17] indeed that is what the Sardis means the
[53:20] escaped ones they are pursued and their
[53:24] great and glorious gains are all but
[53:25] lost
[53:27] they have not been retaken but about all
[53:30] that can be said is that they have
[53:33] escaped not clean escaped as some were
[53:36] uh according to the
[53:39] word he says they had lost much of their
[53:42] Liberties now the Lord says you are
[53:45] potentially back in captivity see that
[53:48] you don't go back to keep from going
[53:52] back become alert and remain every
[53:55] watchful concerning the things of your
[53:58] captivity or you will lose all
[54:02] strengthen yourself now in what you have
[54:05] left in such a manner as to permanently
[54:08] establish what you have and thus ensure
[54:11] against future
[54:12] laws this will be your opportunity to
[54:15] fulfill what you have not fulfilled but
[54:18] did they go on no sir they did not heed
[54:22] the voice of the spirit and another age
[54:25] went into cap activ ity and God raised
[54:28] up others who would carry out his will
[54:31] God bypassed the Lutheran
[54:34] denomination as he has all others they
[54:37] will never come back God had to go on
[54:41] and in a new age bring forth F bring
[54:44] further truth and a little more
[54:47] restoration isn't that
[54:49] powerful that that's that's just
[54:51] powerful when you
[54:53] organize and and and and again I again I
[54:57] I think in Reading in in Reading uh uh
[55:00] the church age book we we need to always
[55:03] I I think we can take everything that we
[55:05] have read from this church age book and
[55:07] apply it to our personal lives and I
[55:09] think it's so important that we do
[55:10] because they were living in a day where
[55:14] they had natural choices for themselves
[55:18] to make and they were going to govern
[55:21] their actions their beliefs their lives
[55:25] according to the way that they to to the
[55:28] doctrine that they set up in their in in
[55:31] in their minds and when they
[55:35] accepted um Church anity which is what
[55:39] they done over the spirit of the Lord
[55:42] leading them further into greater truth
[55:45] leading them further into a greater walk
[55:48] with God they were
[55:50] satisfied with with their w w with their
[55:54] little drawn up Creeds that they that
[55:57] they felt comfortable with Y y'all
[55:59] understand what I'm saying and can that
[56:00] happen in the message well I'm I'm I'm
[56:05] I'm here to tell you it has happened see
[56:08] now the message itself is not a
[56:11] denomination but there are still those
[56:14] who have built by taking uh teachers
[56:18] taking what they want out of it and
[56:19] building their Creeds and almost every
[56:22] one of them well all of them that you
[56:23] that you see that have had that that
[56:27] teachers that have taken and and and and
[56:29] built a denomination around their deal
[56:31] it ends up it ends up it ends up
[56:36] full of strife it ends up full of death
[56:39] is that right I I've been around the
[56:41] message a long time now and every one of
[56:44] those guys that have ever done it amen
[56:46] it ends up they start out going so good
[56:49] and then ends up the whole thing all
[56:51] falling apart amen and especially after
[56:54] the founder dies and when the you know
[56:57] when when the when whether it be Joseph
[56:58] Coleman or levale or maybe I shouldn't
[57:01] be mentioning names but but you see
[57:03] those those groups that followed them
[57:06] and it's hard for them to come back it's
[57:09] hard for them to come back and accept
[57:11] what what what brother brandham had
[57:13] taught because they had their own
[57:15] interpretation of what brother brandham
[57:17] had taught instead of just believing the
[57:19] prophet that God gave us and so that's
[57:22] the reason why our hearts should always
[57:24] be God let me let me have open-minded
[57:28] let my heart be wide open to the message
[57:32] of the hour let your word have its
[57:35] perfect effect in my life I don't want
[57:39] to be one of those that's just along the
[57:41] Wayside God's called me no this message
[57:44] will not denominate that's right it will
[57:48] not denominate there's going to be a
[57:49] brad that's going to walk with her Lord
[57:52] she's going to walk in humility she's
[57:54] going to have a peace with God and is
[57:56] going to be the all the virtues of God
[57:58] flowing through her the powers of God
[58:01] are going to be living in her we're not
[58:03] going to be looking to this great one or
[58:04] that great one we have went through all
[58:06] of those ages we are now following the
[58:09] Holy Spirit right on into the Rapture
[58:11] glory to God Amen I'm so glad for that
[58:14] today so so now remember as as we as we
[58:18] looked here now this is all in that man
[58:20] age and so we go all the way up to when
[58:23] God sends us the prophet you you go go
[58:26] from all of these denominational cycles
[58:29] that are going through but remember as
[58:33] soon as you build your Creed and set
[58:36] your doctrines amen you you you're
[58:39] effectively dying you're killing your
[58:42] experience because God cannot be put in
[58:45] a
[58:46] box he's just not going to be put in a
[58:48] box
[58:50] amen all right so
[58:53] um so we're going to uh okay so now
[58:56] we're down here at at the um the first
[58:59] paragraph of
[59:00] 261 judgment Revelations 3:3 remember
[59:05] therefore how thou Hast received and
[59:08] heard and hold fast and
[59:11] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[59:15] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[59:17] shalt not know what hour I come upon
[59:20] thee I want to read another
[59:24] translation uh uh whis of of this verse
[59:29] be remembering therefore in the way in
[59:32] what way you have received the truth as
[59:35] a permanent deposit and what way you
[59:37] heard it and be safeguarding it and have
[59:42] a change of mind at once it is very
[59:44] evidence from this verse that God had
[59:47] given them truth as a permanent deposit
[59:51] it was received and ir and is
[59:53] irrevocably theirs now now remains to be
[59:57] seen what they will do with it whether
[1:00:00] they will regard it or not that is true
[1:00:05] they had been given the basic truth of
[1:00:07] the whole gospel the just shall live by
[1:00:10] faith salvation is of the Lord they had
[1:00:14] heard the truth of the Bible which cast
[1:00:17] down the doctrines of Rome and said it
[1:00:19] not all papal Authority they knew the
[1:00:22] truth that the church does not save they
[1:00:26] understood the Lord's Supper they had
[1:00:29] light on water baptism they put out the
[1:00:32] images truth why they there never was an
[1:00:36] age with any more men with so much light
[1:00:39] to shed they had enough illumination to
[1:00:42] completely overhaul the old system and
[1:00:45] start out fresh and let God lead them
[1:00:48] line upon line precept upon precept they
[1:00:52] received the truth they wanted it and
[1:00:54] heard it but the question was how did
[1:00:58] they hear it did they hear it to build
[1:01:01] upon or was it with the same attitude
[1:01:05] that many Greeks had something to
[1:01:07] discuss and theorize over evidently the
[1:01:10] rich word of Truth was being heard in an
[1:01:14] academic manner rather than for the
[1:01:17] Practical outworking for God was
[1:01:20] demanding a change of mind concerning it
[1:01:24] if this is the word of God which indeed
[1:01:26] it is then it must be obeyed failure to
[1:01:30] obey would bring judgment when the
[1:01:34] guards of the Sacred Temple were found
[1:01:36] sleeping they were beaten and their
[1:01:38] garments burned what shall the Lord do
[1:01:41] with those who in this age have relaxed
[1:01:44] their guard I will come on thee as a
[1:01:47] thief ancient
[1:01:48] Sardis was constantly harassed by
[1:01:51] Bandits that swooped down from the hills
[1:01:54] and pillaged the people
[1:01:56] thus they only knew too well what the
[1:01:59] spirit was saying in that the coming of
[1:02:01] the Lord is as a thief vigilance and
[1:02:05] preparation alone will suffice to be
[1:02:07] ready for his coming now we know that
[1:02:10] this is a message for the false Vine for
[1:02:13] the coming of the Lord will be as it was
[1:02:15] in the days of Noah the eight saved were
[1:02:19] well aware of the impending flood and
[1:02:22] became a and being aware were prepared
[1:02:26] and saved but the world of the ungodly
[1:02:30] was swept away though they daily were in
[1:02:33] contact with the righteous and heard the
[1:02:35] truth they turned it aside until it was
[1:02:38] too late those completely carnal people
[1:02:41] in that ancient period type out today
[1:02:45] the nominal Christians whose lives are
[1:02:48] full of Earthly things they take
[1:02:50] pleasure in them to such an extent that
[1:02:52] they have no desire for the spiritual
[1:02:55] and are not at all aware of nor ready
[1:02:58] for his appearing the
[1:03:02] theology the eulogy that's what it isans
[1:03:05] Revelations 3:4 thou Hast a few names
[1:03:09] even in Sardis which have not defiled
[1:03:13] their garments they shall walk with me
[1:03:15] in white for they are worthy you know
[1:03:18] when when you read that after hearing
[1:03:20] this other and then to say that God's
[1:03:22] got a predestinated group doesn't that
[1:03:25] just make your heart just Rejoice
[1:03:27] because you can see it in this day that
[1:03:29] we're living in that there are still
[1:03:31] those of us that are saying I want my
[1:03:33] garments
[1:03:35] white
[1:03:38] guys this ain't this this this this this
[1:03:41] is this is not common folks this is not
[1:03:44] common you to have that desire to be
[1:03:47] right with God is don't take that
[1:03:51] lightly how we should say thank you
[1:03:54] Jesus you know it goes back it goes back
[1:03:57] to what brother brandom had had had made
[1:03:58] a comment and I I I've quoted over the
[1:04:01] years because it was such a unique
[1:04:03] comment he says the blood does not save
[1:04:07] you you are saved by
[1:04:10] predestination the blood simply keeps
[1:04:13] you
[1:04:14] clean okay in other words if your name
[1:04:18] was not put there on that Lamb's Book of
[1:04:21] Life in the first place and the genetics
[1:04:23] of God were not placed in your heart
[1:04:26] the world has the blood of God at their
[1:04:28] disposal they have the word of God at
[1:04:31] their disposal they have the message of
[1:04:33] the hour it's all over the
[1:04:36] internet but only the elect have that
[1:04:39] something in their heart that they must
[1:04:42] be right with god oh how we should thank
[1:04:45] the Lord for that it says of course as
[1:04:48] we're um we're at the uh first paragraph
[1:04:51] of
[1:04:52] 263 of course the word names mean people
[1:04:56] as it says in Acts
[1:04:58] 1:5 concerning those in the upper room
[1:05:01] the number of names together were about
[1:05:05] 120 but to me it goes far beyond just
[1:05:09] signifying people it brings out the
[1:05:12] truth that is set forth in every age
[1:05:15] which was spoken to us by our Lord with
[1:05:18] great emphasis it is this the church
[1:05:21] system of these ages is made up of two
[1:05:24] Vines true and false god in his own
[1:05:28] Sovereign purpose has put them all
[1:05:31] together calling them the church see in
[1:05:35] this age how he has rebuked them saying
[1:05:37] unto the church which is not churches
[1:05:41] are ins Sardis but lumping them together
[1:05:45] the church which is I Know Thy works you
[1:05:49] are dead your works are unfulfilled and
[1:05:52] then he goes on thou this church in Sol
[1:05:55] has a few people in you that are right
[1:06:00] and not wrong like the majority these
[1:06:03] walk in clean garments they are worthy
[1:06:06] of me now these people that were the
[1:06:10] true saints of God were walking all
[1:06:12] pleasing unto the Lord their garments
[1:06:15] were clean you see in those days the
[1:06:18] garments would sweep along on the road
[1:06:21] and pick up dirt and
[1:06:23] defilement and they these were watching
[1:06:25] how they walked so that they were not
[1:06:27] corrupted by the world they were in the
[1:06:30] spirit and walking in the spirit they
[1:06:32] were holy and Without Blame before him
[1:06:35] thus they were fulfilling their purpose
[1:06:37] for that is what Ephesians 1 and4 says
[1:06:40] is the purpose of God for us that we
[1:06:42] should be holy and Without Blame before
[1:06:45] him now from this verse which shows the
[1:06:48] elect to be a few names you can clear
[1:06:51] you can see clearly what we have been
[1:06:54] teaching about this age
[1:06:56] it was chaotic it was unfulfilled it was
[1:06:59] split scores of ways and God rebuked it
[1:07:02] almost in its
[1:07:04] entirety it was weak and sickly and
[1:07:08] ready to die it was not the Glorious era
[1:07:11] of the carnal-minded Protestants that
[1:07:13] the carnal-minded Protestant historians
[1:07:16] have tried to make it one quick look at
[1:07:19] that tree saw it was cankered and
[1:07:21] blighted denuded of leaf and Barren of
[1:07:25] fruit except for some deformed and warmy
[1:07:28] fruit that was fast dropping to the
[1:07:30] ground but hold a minute look closer
[1:07:35] there at the top in the light of the sun
[1:07:37] were some first fruits a few names
[1:07:40] perfect in him for they were born of him
[1:07:44] filled with him walking with him by his
[1:07:47] word someone shout
[1:07:49] hallelujah thank God for those few they
[1:07:53] shall walk with me that is what God says
[1:07:56] he will bestow upon them that U that
[1:07:59] walk
[1:08:00] upright bestow upon them for this
[1:08:03] upright walk this that is part of their
[1:08:07] inheritance that he reserves for them if
[1:08:10] they were willing to walk with him
[1:08:12] through the toils and snares of life and
[1:08:15] be honored to him he was going to reward
[1:08:18] them he is not forgetful of our labor of
[1:08:22] love God will recompense us for our
[1:08:26] efforts to please him yes they had
[1:08:29] walked through the world and had not
[1:08:31] partaken of it they had not let the
[1:08:33] world's systems overcome them when the
[1:08:36] El estrous names of the age had yielded
[1:08:38] to the banishment of
[1:08:40] state and chosen political mindedness
[1:08:43] rather than spiritual mindedness and
[1:08:45] were on their way back into the world
[1:08:47] these few stood for the word of God and
[1:08:50] thereby honored the Lord now he would
[1:08:53] honor them in return
[1:08:56] for they shall walk with him in white
[1:08:59] they had identified themselves with him
[1:09:01] on earth now he would identify himself
[1:09:05] with them in the New Jerusalem how
[1:09:07] marvelous will be that identification it
[1:09:10] makes me rejoice and yet makes me weep
[1:09:14] to think of his
[1:09:16] condens for you will knowe that he is
[1:09:18] not dressed in another in another color
[1:09:21] different from the Saints as Earthly
[1:09:23] leaders would do so do
[1:09:26] no they are like him he is like them
[1:09:31] they are like him even as John said they
[1:09:34] shall see him as he is for they are
[1:09:37] worthy do you realize who was saying
[1:09:40] this it is Jesus the worthy one himself
[1:09:45] that is the only one this is the only
[1:09:47] one who is accounted worthy to take the
[1:09:50] book out of the hand of him who sits on
[1:09:52] the throne and now this worthy one is
[1:09:55] saying to his Saints you are worthy here
[1:10:00] is this one the only one qualified to
[1:10:03] judge and indeed all judgment is
[1:10:05] committed unto him and he says you are
[1:10:09] worthy these words are as astounding as
[1:10:13] as are the words in Romans
[1:10:16] 833b God says I am righteous the way
[1:10:19] translation there in the white light of
[1:10:22] God's righteousness hear the sweet voice
[1:10:25] of Jesus as he says these are mine they
[1:10:29] are righteous they are worthy they shall
[1:10:32] walk with me in
[1:10:36] white you know I when I was reading that
[1:10:39] I just I I wanted to
[1:10:43] cry how is
[1:10:46] it that God
[1:10:49] can and you know we look at ourselves
[1:10:52] and we see such imperfections we see
[1:10:55] we see we know us we know our mind
[1:10:59] battles we know the things that that we
[1:11:02] Face we
[1:11:03] know we we we
[1:11:06] know we we we know the Frailty of who we
[1:11:10] are but he when he looks he's looking
[1:11:14] upon a heart that loves
[1:11:16] him and if you notice all through the
[1:11:18] church ages he's always pointing out
[1:11:22] every one of those ages you're mine your
[1:11:25] mind I and he and he sent those
[1:11:27] Messengers to make sure that the elect
[1:11:32] knew who they
[1:11:35] were I think it's
[1:11:37] beautiful I I think when I when I look
[1:11:40] at this when when I look at and and here
[1:11:43] we are today Satan fights so hard
[1:11:46] especially in this age of mental
[1:11:49] illness Satan wants to take
[1:11:53] that because he's not he's he's not just
[1:11:56] hitting those guys outside outside the
[1:11:58] bride and and with mental illness and
[1:12:02] and trying but he's working on your mind
[1:12:04] too and the only thing that keeps you
[1:12:05] sane is the power of the holy spirit in
[1:12:08] your life but just because you've got
[1:12:11] the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that Satan's
[1:12:12] not just constantly
[1:12:15] just hitting you hard you're not worthy
[1:12:18] you're not loved you're not appreciated
[1:12:20] you're not and it and and and and I tell
[1:12:23] you what I I would if we we took a poll
[1:12:26] tonight and and if we were all honest
[1:12:28] there would probably be 95 to 100% of us
[1:12:32] all all raise our hands feeling like we
[1:12:35] we we we we are unworthy or we're
[1:12:37] unloved or we're Satan fights those
[1:12:41] things or or fights us with those things
[1:12:44] in our mind but I I I I look at this at
[1:12:47] these Church ages and I look at the
[1:12:50] opening of the seals and I I see I I see
[1:12:53] how God has come and just remove the
[1:12:56] the remove the curtain so that you could
[1:12:59] see it and to me it gives you that
[1:13:04] peace it gives when Satan's fighting you
[1:13:07] so hard it's like God Is providing the
[1:13:10] bride that antidote to that spirit that
[1:13:14] wants to to make every one of you go
[1:13:16] insane and he's opening it up and he's
[1:13:19] saying I have been there through every
[1:13:21] one of these ages and I have kept them
[1:13:23] and I want you to take this
[1:13:26] Revelation this revelation of of what I
[1:13:29] think about
[1:13:30] you this Revelation don't look at your
[1:13:35] your inabilities don't look at your uh
[1:13:39] your peculiarities don't look at at at
[1:13:43] at any of those things keep your eyes
[1:13:46] upon me I will lead you through to this
[1:13:51] Rapture it's a promise he can't lie he's
[1:13:56] never lost one and he ain't going to
[1:13:58] lose
[1:13:59] you never lost one and he's not going to
[1:14:03] lose well that should just make us all
[1:14:05] just
[1:14:06] Rejoice
[1:14:07] Hallelujah he loves his
[1:14:11] own and again this is not a learning
[1:14:16] this is the holy spirit this is the
[1:14:18] great Shepherd and saying your mind
[1:14:21] Satan stay away from him can you say
[1:14:23] Amen yes amen so so um now we're going

[1:15:36] was you know
[1:15:40] uh the
[1:15:43] um the beautiful thing is is is we're
[1:15:46] now we went through the Dark Ages and as
[1:15:50] brother brandom has just put it out
[1:15:51] there and he's and and we're and again
[1:15:54] it's going to really get into it in that
[1:15:56] much the more um how that to me it's
[1:16:01] it's it's it's going to get it's going
[1:16:03] to get
[1:16:04] glorious
[1:16:05] because as as he said about the Lutheran
[1:16:08] Church that God planned it that way God
[1:16:13] planned that it was going to only go so
[1:16:15] far and then would fall back and then it
[1:16:17] would go so far and it would fall back
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:22] and he he begins he begins to talk about
[1:16:26] how
[1:16:26] that he he he had to raise this one up
[1:16:30] and had to raise that next group up and
[1:16:33] had to make in order to come to your age
[1:16:38] of
[1:16:39] rapture he had that's that that's been
[1:16:42] his whole design his whole design was to
[1:16:46] come to the restoration age that we're
[1:16:48] living in now and we're blessed to be in
[1:16:52] that age where the restoration is coming
[1:16:55] where the bride's coming and what's
[1:16:58] going to bring on the
[1:16:59] Rapture the the the Rapture is not a set
[1:17:04] time the Rapture is the elect
[1:17:08] understanding what God has been doing
[1:17:11] and building that faith in our
[1:17:14] hearts and we'll get to that point to
[1:17:17] where we will not be we'll be walking
[1:17:20] with God and and and and we'll be gone
[1:17:23] and I believe that's what God is doing
[1:17:25] he's want not not denominating around
[1:17:28] him uh William
[1:17:30] brandom no
[1:17:32] way brother Brandon was just a vessel
[1:17:35] that God used to bring the message but
[1:17:37] brother and and and but the life is in
[1:17:40] the message brother brandom's in the
[1:17:42] grave and he's waiting to come out of
[1:17:45] the Grave can you say Amen oh bless the
[1:17:49] Lord what a glorious gospel what a what
[1:17:52] a glorious God Amen so any anyone have a
[1:17:56] h have something to say Amen you want to
[1:17:59] add to to what we've uh what we've said
[1:18:02] or you got a
[1:18:05] question
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:13] Len that
[1:18:17] influences
[1:18:19] 1964 and uh go along with that they are
[1:18:23] worthy and
[1:18:25] that he talked he read the scripture
[1:18:28] where the where the angel or the
[1:18:30] seraphim or cherubim with the uh
[1:18:34] tongs uh took a coal from off the altar
[1:18:38] yeah and touched Isaiah's lips yeah and
[1:18:41] said your iniquity is taken away isn't
[1:18:44] that beautiful and that just hit me so
[1:18:47] strong when you read yeah that about
[1:18:49] these and Sardis are
[1:18:52] worthy yes that is so true took the Coes
[1:18:56] from off the Altar and touched his lips
[1:19:01] thine
[1:19:02] iniquity you know and and
[1:19:06] um uh it we won't be in this next one
[1:19:09] but it'll be I believe it's in this
[1:19:11] Sardis age where brother Brandon will
[1:19:13] talk about that's I think it's the exact
[1:19:15] I think it's in this one where we've got
[1:19:17] to be sufficiently impressed with the
[1:19:19] word in our age because that word is the
[1:19:24] Revelation the Revelation is is what is
[1:19:29] is transforming this bride we are not
[1:19:32] just part of the Shu we are the
[1:19:35] restoration of the word
[1:19:37] seed
[1:19:40] Hallelujah I I I heard someone say and I
[1:19:45] agree that true justification could not
[1:19:48] happen under Luther because true
[1:19:52] justification he still had so much of
[1:19:54] all of the brought so much of Mama's
[1:19:57] ways true justification could only come
[1:20:02] through the restoration of the word and
[1:20:05] we are receiving the bride will not be
[1:20:08] manhandled at all the bride will not
[1:20:11] have a portion of word plus wendle
[1:20:13] Martin's opinion a portion of the word
[1:20:16] plus Merl igate's opinion we have got
[1:20:19] the word and the word alone and that's
[1:20:23] what is bringing about this
[1:20:26] Rapture through uh uh through that word
[1:20:30] is that isn't that beautiful true
[1:20:33] justification because we we're not we're
[1:20:36] not listening to Mama's ideas Daddy's
[1:20:38] ideas or what this one thinks or what
[1:20:39] that one thinks we're just staying right
[1:20:41] there with the Vindicated word of the
[1:20:43] hour this is the purest form since
[1:20:47] Pentecost I say I say even the more
[1:20:51] pure
[1:20:53] amen because it was not because they
[1:20:57] didn't know even even the Apostle Paul
[1:20:59] didn't even know that it was going to go
[1:21:01] down through the Dark
[1:21:02] Ages th those those early Saints didn't
[1:21:05] know they were looking for the coming of
[1:21:06] the Lord to be happening in their day
[1:21:09] but here we are amen looking and we see
[1:21:11] the full scope of things and how God has
[1:21:14] how how God has brought it out and to me
[1:21:16] it it produces a faith greater than
[1:21:20] anything else I I just I just tell you
[1:21:22] amen we should expect miracles we should
[1:21:24] expect the supernatural we should expect
[1:21:26] because the supernatural God Is With
[1:21:32] Us
[1:21:34] amen I'm expecting I'm I'm
[1:21:38] expecting the the the the areas where
[1:21:40] we're needing miracles in our church I'm
[1:21:42] expecting it I don't know when or how
[1:21:45] but I'm expecting it to come I'm
[1:21:47] expecting joints to be to to to to grow
[1:21:50] I'm expecting eyeballs I'm just
[1:21:51] expecting anytime to hear those kinds of
[1:21:53] things because we're living in the with
[1:21:57] a supernatural God this is Rapture age
[1:22:02] that's right that means that
[1:22:05] means the groom and the and the bride
[1:22:08] amen are hand in hand that right amen oh
[1:22:13] believe it keep that keep that Doctrine
[1:22:15] simple believe believe with everything
[1:22:17] that is within you oh that old devil
[1:22:20] that wants to tell you well just I
[1:22:22] rebuke that devil every time I I pray I
[1:22:25] I'm serious every time I pray is God
[1:22:28] take that hard heart of unbelief from me
[1:22:32] I want no unbelief in my heart I want a
[1:22:36] pure heart to believe every word amen
[1:22:39] anyone else have something to say as the
[1:22:42] musicians
[1:22:44] come praise the Lord Mitch brother
[1:22:48] Mitch I remember when I first read that
[1:22:51] a part there
[1:22:56] greatest
[1:22:57] yeah's a lot
[1:23:02] of
[1:23:14] yeah and if you'll notice he has never
[1:23:17] he has never lost with a debate never
[1:23:20] it's what the prophet said there in that
[1:23:22] book so he he's old always got a way of
[1:23:25] being able to outwit out out talk and
[1:23:28] and yeah you're
[1:23:32] right yeah that's right yeah y the Lord
[1:23:37] rebuke you as you go along
[1:23:43] more
[1:23:50] yeah
[1:23:53] yeah yeah
[1:23:56] yeah amen but the lamb has taken the
[1:24:01] book and he is worthy amen oh blessed be
[1:24:07] the name of the
[1:24:08] Lord you
[1:24:10] know I love him I love him with all of
[1:24:14] my
[1:24:17] heart I I I I just want to and I want to
[1:24:21] love you more
[1:24:24] and it's a constant
[1:24:29] washing but I'm glad Christ doesn't have
[1:24:31] to die millions of
[1:24:34] times but it's a constant
[1:24:37] washing it's us taking God's word
[1:24:40] letting the Holy Spirit convict our
[1:24:42] hearts and
[1:24:43] choosing not to push him aside like the
[1:24:46] Lutheran and like this one and like the
[1:24:47] Pentecostal remember whenever you push
[1:24:50] the conviction
[1:24:51] aside then then the holy SP Spirit stops
[1:24:55] walking with
[1:24:57] you so lord always give me that heart of
[1:25:02] conviction always don't ever don't ever
[1:25:06] quit don't don't don't ever stop
[1:25:08] convicting my
[1:25:09] heart and Lord Jesus forgive
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:14] me for allowing my ears
[1:25:18] to to just grow deaf to your word grow
[1:25:22] deaf to your Holy Spirit nudging me
[1:25:24] you're
[1:25:26] wrong or you need to get right the
[1:25:30] question is not is
[1:25:32] not it's not whether there's not blood
[1:25:34] for any of us or forgiveness for any of
[1:25:37] us cuz there is he's there's forgiveness
[1:25:39] for everyone of
[1:25:41] us the elect is the reason the blood was
[1:25:46] shed and the blood will never lose its
[1:25:50] power but we get hardened hearts in this
[1:25:53] old evil
[1:25:55] world and it's so easy just to ignore
[1:25:59] the Holy
[1:26:00] Spirit that's
[1:26:03] right I don't want to get
[1:26:06] there I don't I don't want to stand
[1:26:08] before the Lord on that
[1:26:12] day and the Lord say you made
[1:26:15] it but you you
[1:26:19] didn't you didn't wash your garments you
[1:26:21] didn't you didn't bring me much on
[1:26:25] with your attitudes with your this with
[1:26:29] that I I want
[1:26:31] him I want him to say hey come sit on
[1:26:35] the throne with me I gave you my
[1:26:38] blood I gave you my
[1:26:41] word and you were diligent to
[1:26:46] overcome I want
[1:26:48] that again the devil wants to work on us
[1:26:51] all and say yeah that'll will never
[1:26:57] happen but I believe it will happen
[1:26:59] because there's something in my heart
[1:27:02] that is screaming out I must
[1:27:06] overcome amen do y'all have that is that
[1:27:09] is that something in y'all's Hearts the
[1:27:10] job I want to
[1:27:11] overcome do you think you think the
[1:27:14] devil's children has that
[1:27:15] desire
[1:27:21] no I just don't think that
[1:27:26] but he wants to give us pleasures and
[1:27:28] things and just keep our mind occupied
