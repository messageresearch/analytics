scriptures to job 23 and 1 amen I trust you had a good week a good Thanksgiving I feel a fat and Sassy this morning I know I know I did I probably gained 10 lbs just on ham and and apple pies and stuff but uh I know it's a wonderful season to to be thankful for that God has not only do we have a a freedom of worship here but God has given us something to to worship with you I believe we've got the greatest message upon the Earth that has showed us how to worship not just in in Emotion not just in a sensation but in spirit and in truth amen amen job 23 And1 the Bible would say then job answered and said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my calls before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered from from Forever from my judge behold I go forward but he is not there backward but I cannot perceive him on the left where he where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps which he has which his way have I kept and and declined and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandments of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food but he is in one mind who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with Him amen can we bow our heads this this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor it is to come into your house one more time lord as we feel your presence Among Us God lord we ask as we come coming to this part of the service that you would just speak today Lord you know the hearts Lord the desires the needs that are in the building today Father Lord I ask as the word would come forth Lord may it may it strengthen Lord may it edify the the hearts of your your people that is here today Lord if there's some that is discouraged father we ask that you would uplift them today Lord we we lay their service into your hands father in your precious name amen you may be seated this morning and I just have a simple subject um last time I preached I I was preached on stabilized by the Unseen and I might just continue on that but I know this is a a familiar passage of scripture and it's been preached on a lot and I I just want to read this quote here and and I've read it before but brother Brandon would say that's what we do you must find the will of God before you can do the will of God you must know what the will is and the matter and then don't turn it loose as the lady said today when she was trying to get beyond the sound barrier the plane just picks up a speed and goes at an unlimited when it passes the sound barrier and when you can pray until you pass the doubt barrier then you're running free and you can go on and then you're nothing can bother you then because you're running free you're past the unbelief it's done been settled it's all over when you get the Assurance in your heart that is going to be that way you're just as happy as if it has already happened so I believe you must find the will of God before you can do the will of God then brother Brandon would tell us then you don't turn it loose and and we would see that Jesus would be a perfect example of this as he would say I would do nothing till my till I see my father do it I seek not my own will but but the will of my father and you can just imagine how much Faith Jesus would have to have in the will of the father as he would be in the Garden of Gethsemane and would say not my will but thy will be done he knew what he was going to have to go through to perform the will of God but yet there was so much faith that he would say not my even though I have to be beaten I have to be scored I have my beard has to be plucked out there's one thing on my mind that is the will of God and this ain't an easy life this ain't an easy Journey we go through hardships we go through trials Temptations mind battles but we got one thing on our mind that is the will of God and I and I will love I would love job's confession my foot have held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandments of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food job knew what he was doing was the will of the Lord he knew that no matter what the naysayers were saying what the what the the trials he was going through he knew that he was in the will of God and I believe that's something we all have to find in all of our life is what is the will of God for my life cuz once you find the will of God then it's something that stabilizes you you know cuz you know many time brother Brandon would tell us that that uh uh clouds that are over over your head is not a a sign of God's dis approval neither are sunny days signs of his approval but he says we we the sign of his approval is in his love that he shed for us you know and so when we go through hard times we got to know that we are in the will of God and brother Brandon would say so many times we get to a place where we can't stand still and nervous just as we sure to start to do something good then we see trouble coming but that is the devil trying to upset the program of God we find in our individual lives and we find in the church world we find in our national Affairs you find it everywhere then we can know that we are getting ready to do right wrong is always present but the way to overcome that is to think in your heart which which way would God would have you to go and which way is the best way then stay with that way so as soon as you start to do something good the Bible would say evil is always present and so what the devil is trying to do is when you find a direction for your life he tries to come with hardships and get you to second guess the will that God has revealed to you he tries to make you nervous and and you know here in job is saying I have not done nothing wrong my my foots my my my feet is is walking in your way my I have kept your words upon my lips more than my necessary food I know where I am at it's not judgment I don't know why I'm going through it but I am in the will of God and you see when emotions come and and try to lead you away from the will of God God for your life you got to make sure you're stabilized because if you don't know you're in the will of God when hardships comes well did I do something wrong or you know uh did I make the wrong decision and we would see brother Brandon would give us the secret to overcome this find in your heart the way God wants you to go and stay with it and I believe if we would find the way that God would want for us there would be more people stable you know you you wouldn't be mad of this one mad at that one we might not understand why we go through it but we know this is where God has put us and if God has put us here that is where the blessings of God are going to fall you remember brother Brandon would tell the story of the missionary that felt to go overseas and take his family with him and the council would tell him that there's diseases over there there's plagues over there you're crazy for taking your family there and he would say well I'm safer there in the will of God than here and out of the will of God so it might not make sense to the world but if you found the will of God press toward the mark no matter what comes against you no matter the oppositions if you found that the Rapture is the will of God for you press for it it don't matter if unbelief comes and doubt comes and Skeptics come stick with the will of God that God has show to you and job was constantly pointing to the will of God he knoweth the way that I take and when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold and I love that because he was still looking to the end product you know he he wasn't looking at at the as sheep he was on because he would say when he when he had tried me and brother Brandon would say the word tempt is to be is to be tried and so while job was being tempted God was trying him so that he could come forth as gold and here job was looking at that in product even though the the the the the things he was going through was hurting him he was still looking that I'm going to come forth as gold and oh my that's what we we got to keep in our sight is the finished product that everything that I go through is molding me and shaping me to come forth in the image that God had for before the foundation of the world job would saying in job 23 and14 he Perth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him he performeth the things that is appointed unto me job knew he wasn't here by accident he knew that he wasn't on the ash Heap by acci acent he knew that his children wasn't taken away by accident but he was walking in an appointed time that God was leading him through and he would have an assurance that he performthe and and we look up the story of job and many times we think that it's the devil coming and causing chaos but God would allow it God would appoint it and and allow the devil would to come and bring him through these hard times and even though job didn't understand he knew that he has appointed me to go through this and if he has appointed me to go through this I know he's going to lead me through the other side of it and if God has appointed you to go through hardships don't give up in the trial God is going to be faithful to lead you through it he performthe knew that he was just even though that that his friend were calling him a sinner brother the brandom says he knew that he was just and he was just waiting for inspiration to strike so there he stood even though he could not fear or feel that God was near he knew by him doing the will of God by Burnt offerings that will made him perfect and so it didn't matter the accusations that were coming against him the will of God was greater than the accusations and let me say this the will of God that you find for your life is greater than every accusation that comes against you it's greater than every every doubt and skeptic that comes that comes against your mind you know this is the will of God and in this will is perfection and we will see that there there there's a blessing with staying with the will of God Hebrews 10 and 36 for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise and so after you stick with the will of God there's a blessing with it and I believe we don't want to just you know pray and feel like God is leading us this way but then it gets hard we're going to turn around and go this way when that gets hard we're going to turn around and go that way what what is the will of God who's speaking to you then who's leading to you then but if you truly found the will of God there is a promise for you on the other side of it and I don't believe that we we sometimes we get stagnated sometimes we get we go through dark times but I don't believe that is the end of the will in your life even when you don't feel him God still has a promise for you and an inheritance for you if you can just stick with where God has placed you oh Hallelujah and we would see that the Bible would tell us in 1 Thessalonians 3 and 2 and S Timothy and our brother and minister of God and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourself know that we appointed there unto so here come a minister to to to strengthen and establish you that when you do go through afflictions you're not moved by him the Apostle Paul would say none of these things moved me he was established in the will of God but the Brandon would say that the Apostle Paul was harnessed to the will of God and so he would also the Apostle Paul would say I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he could not be disobedient to it cuz he was tied to it so whenever you're tied to the will of God all you can do is follow what God has for your life Oh my he would say none of these things move me so when you're tied to something you can only go the direction what is leading you and you remember whenever the donkey was tied and had to be loose Jesus would tell the disciples go to a certain place and you're going to find a donkey right and he's going to be tied and he would say loose him and let him go so before he could fulfill the purpose of Jesus he had to be untied to where he was you see and if we're tied to the will of the Father the devil can come and try to get you to fulfill his purpose but if you're tied already and harnessed to the will of God there's nothing the devil can do he can come against your mind come against your spirit come against your body but if that Soul Is Anchored to the will of God you cannot be led any other direction but what you're tied to oh Hallelujah the Apostle Paul would say shall separate us from the love of God if we're tied to it nothing can separate us oh he would say you know sh tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Pearl or sword for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter but nay in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so he was pointing back the overcoming strength that he would have to go through these things was the very thing that he could not be separated from he would say none of these things shall separate us from the love of Christ then he would say we we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so he was anchored and harnessed to the very strength that was going to bring him through the famine the Pearl The Sword whatever he would go through he had something he could point to that was going to strengthen him to go through it and that's why we got to find the will of God because we're going to face Hard Times we're going to go through Temptations we're going to go through through tough circumstances but if you find the will of God nothing can separate me from the will of God and it's that will that that that is giving us the strength to go through the hard times oh Hallelujah you see who shall separate us from the love of God and you know brother the Brandon would say the great miracle of Noah's day was Noah being tucked away in the ark he says when the rainfall the great miracle was Noah resting in the ark and you see that is something that that is hard to do sometimes is rest you know you got to rest in the will of God and brother Brandon would tell us the Christian experience is based solemnly holy upon rest come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest we're tossed about with everything until until you come to Christ then it is all finished resting in Christ perfectly no matter what comes or ghost nothing can touch us without without it coming over the shepherd He has to permit it ain't that powerful he says you're tossed to you're tossed round about until you come to Christ then you are resting and what is so incredible was when when brother Brandon would go beyond the curtain of time he would ask them you know is Paul going to be judged by the message that he preached and they say yeah he's going to be judged and brother brandom says good because I only preached what he preached and what would the multitude say we're resting upon that they found though that that this message was the will of God and they found a stability they found a rest even though they were on the other side they were still resting in the stability that God gave this generation and you might go through the valley of the shadow of death but there is a perseverance there's a rest inside of this message that you might not understand while you're going through it but you found the will of God and there's a perseverance to go through it oh hallelujah we're not tossed tossed about anymore we're stabilized in Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah and you know this ain't the time to tuck tail and run you know that the only reason the devil tries to disrupt something is because you've got something worth worth disrupting you know you've never seen we've used it before you've never seen a 45 counter counterfeit dollar be cuz there's not a genuine out there it only attacks the ones that is genuine and the only reason the Devil comes with doubt and against this message is because he knows it is the power under salvation the Apostle Paul would say I am not ashamed of this gospel for it is the power of God and I believe this message has made us not ashamed because this is the power of God under salvation and brother brownon going talk about Jehoshaphat and the nation of Jud he would say Jehoshaphat was a righteous man and he says he was trying to do the best that he knew to do to serve the Lord and he says he was doing his best then all of a sudden now the moabites were coming to attack and he says then all of the people would start to get frustrated he says they started to get worried they they started to get get to become afraid and brother brandham says the Lord would speak by inspiration and would say stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and I think it's so incredible cuz brother brandom says as long as they were praying it was God's battle as long as they were together and praying here was God's battle so whenever When Trials comes against the church that ain't time to get divided that ain't time that to choose signs choose favorites or this did this that one did that this one done that it's the time to come together and let God fight the battle you see it's easy to get frustrated when when this here happens and and troubles happens in the church then we just want to you know p to oursel but brother brandom says as long as they were together God fought the Battle the disciples got together in the upper room and won Accord then God fa so you want to see the blessings of God come together as a family come together as a church come together as a unity and strive for one goal that is the will of God but you see here when whenever the the the moabites was coming against Judah it was troubles trying to break up the will of God for that Nation and inspiration would tell Jehoshaphat stand still and we would see that whenever Peter would walk out upon the Water what would Peter say if it is you bid me to come and that really spoke to me because Peter knew if he was walking in his own ability he had to pull himself up if he fell down right but he knew if Jesus told him and bid him to walk on the water it was Jesus responsibility to pull him up if he started to sink and you see once find the will of God you're not walking in your own ability you're not walking by by your own emotions you're not walking by what you want to do and if you was you know that I'm walking by my own by my own shoes but if I'm walking on the will of God my footsteps are ordered by the Lord and here would come Peter and and I know we spoke on this last time but brother brandom says Peter was walking on substance and not water so he was walking on the will of God and brother Brandon would say that his substance would have led him straight to Jesus until he looked at the waves and got afraid you see ain't that incredible his substance would have kept him all the way to the feet of Jesus until he got afraid and that's exactly what the devil does is he wants you to get afraid with the first situation that comes against you in the will of God maybe I'm not in the will of God but brother brandom says as soon as he got afraid his substance was taken away from him and he says he still professed his faith but he had no substance you see the devil wants you to serve God out of fear you see there's a difference between Godly fear and Satan's fear you see the devil likes to come and whisper in your ear that you got to be afraid of God how many's ever ever heard the Devil tell you that before that you got to be afraid of you're you're you're afraid to make a mistakes you're you're afraid to do this wrong that God's not going to love you anymore if you if you make a mistake God's going to take his grace away from you or if you do this you you sin day of Grace away it is fear trying to take away the will of God that God has given you and brother Brandon would tell us he would say the fear of God is not being afraid of him but that means you respect him you reverence him and so there's a difference between fearing God out out out of being afraid and reverencing him you see whenever Peter was upon the Water he wasn't reverencing the water he was a he was afraid of the water and so that caused him to lose lose his substance and what happens when you lose your substance you've got no strength to battle the devil with right if you're afraid of somebody you've got no strength to to to whip on somebody you know if me and Caleb got into a fight and I was say and I was afraid of him and I didn't think I could whip him I'm going to Honker down to him right I'm going to let him run me over I'm going to let him dictate what I think what I say you know and if the devil can ever get you to serve God out of fear you lose your substance which is the very thing you overcome the devil with right so whenever you lose your substance you've got no strength whenever spirits come against your home when spirits come against your mind when spirits come against your family there's no strength to combat those spirits and so you just Honker down you back up you back up but there's got to come a time that we cast out fear and bring in the strength of the Lord and say there's no Spirits they're going to plag my home no Spirits you remember the Brandon would tell the story about the about the man that would have the dream and in this dream there was a was a devil that would come up and say Boo yall remember that he would back down and he would get smaller and the devil would get bigger he would say boo he would get and every time he honered down to that enemy he would get smaller and the devil would get bigger you see this ain't the time to play with Spirits this ain't the time to Honker down to every emotion Honker down to every heart feeling Honker down to every bitterness that comes against you what how would the story go but the brandom says he's seen a Bible I believe and would grab that Bible and would say boo and he would get bigger and the devil would get smaller this is the time to pick up the will of God for this generation and said don't matter what comes against my family I am not hunkering down to any Spirit I'm not hunkering down to anything that comes against me it's time to get some crit about us and say no devil you're not coming into my home you're not coming into my mind but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world we have found the will of God and in the will of God is the strength oh Hallelujah it is stabilized us oh Hallelujah and you see brother Brandon would say this the greatest thing that I find against the church tonight is fear he says everybody is scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy Carefree just like these fellas uh singing up here and the brother testifying that that he's just free there's nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ God has promised it oh so we're not worshiping God out of fear because fear is going to take away your substance brother Brandon you know he he would say this here and he would say in the church and the church and you sitting here tonight oh you're struggling and struggling and God's pulling to you and showing you things if you can ever get past the sin barrier of unbelief the unlimited Revival will break forth through the United States and everywhere if you can get beyond the sound barrier that sin barrier of unbelief oh is it true does it mean me could I be healed could I be saved could I be filled with the Holy Ghost he says get beyond that you see that's what fear does is it makes this message unpersonalized to dictate you and pull you away from the will of God but brother brandom says if you can get beyond that you've got an unlimited Revival oh Hallelujah we don't come to the the house of God out of fear that we're going to miss the Rapture that that I'm not going to be saved we come to we come to church because we know this is where the blessings of God are falling and where're two or three are gathered in my name I will be in the midst we don't come here out of fear we come here because there's an limited Revival that God has given us in this generation it's not going through America it's coming to the bride it's a bride's Revival a word Revival that has brought the bride out of a denominational Slumber and has given her a strength to persevere with oh Hallelujah and he continues on to say if you break through and the Holy Ghost comes upon you I'm telling you you're beyond to B then this 50 miles of Elbow Room oh I say come on up a little higher get past the fear get past the unbelief get past the emotions and complexes and worship God not out of fear but out of Faith oh Hallelujah cuz if you're listening to messages I hope I'm not just beating a dead horse this morning but if you're listening to messages because you have to you're never going to find the will of God but if you're listening to messages and praying out of Faith then God can reveal himself oh Hallelujah brother Brandon was say that's the trouble with men tonight that's the trouble with the people tonight he says that's the biggest curse there is on a Full Gospel people or any other people people is because they are afraid God has made the provision but you're afraid to take his word for it oh my the biggest curse and he says upon the four gospel people and any other people is there afraid to accept God's provision and I say that can come upon message people that God has provided his will in this generation but we're afraid to act upon it you see but I believe that we can walk in a Godly fear with rest the Bible would tell us in Acts 9:31 then have the churches rest throughout all Judea Galilee and Samaria and were edified walking in the fear of the Lord and so there is a rest whenever you're not walking out of the devil's fear but out of the fear of the Lord which is reverence then there's a rest in the will of God that you can know that no matter what I go through we are in the will of God because you see what the Brandon would tell us the perfect faith and order to have perfect Faith you have to know who you are and you you can't have condemnation you remember you remember the brand I'm telling that and perfect Faith he says Jesus knew who he was and he says he had no condemnation and you would see one of the first two things that the devil always throws at you when you go through hard times condemnation you done something wrong you made the wrong choice you made the wrong decision and then he comes to doubt who you are and what your purpose is and so in order to have the perfect faith you got to get Beyond those two things and we would see brother brandom would say this but as long as you're doing things that are wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you see you automatically know that you're wrong you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you're a Believer then there's nothing between you and God you ask what you will and it will be given because it is the word that's given to you just like those disciples so if you know there's nothing against you and you know who you are then you can ask what you will and God would give it to you ain't that an incredible thing that God has given us such an authority in this generation excuse me and brother Brandon would tell us that job was a man of inspiration and everybody would come to job and ask the ask what the Lord has for them and this is really really spoke to me here cuz here he was brother brandom says everybody respect to job everybody looked up to job anytime they needed to hear from God they came to job and here brother the brandom says when he got on his as sheep he had no inspiration ain't that incredible brother brandom says the Vindication that job was a servant of God was his inspiration could you imagine the Mind battles that job was having the very channel that God worked through him was dried up now and brother brandom says and he says all of those friends that would come come to him for inspiration now all left him and here brother Brandon would say this and man this really struck me he would say he wanted talking about job he wanted to see if there was somebody who could intercede for him he had interceded for so many people but now was there somebody that could speak for him could there be somebody put his hand on job a sinful man and a holy God and make a bridge the way could he go to his house and knock out the door when he opened the door and talked to him a while ain't that incredible he interceded for everybody else but now he needed somebody to talk to and man that really spoke to me as a father as a preacher as a pastor as a mother you fixed your mothers get up you fix breakfast for the children you make sure the house is clean you're serving everybody you're interceding everybody but what about you you know P daddies they go to work that they provide for their LED they provide they make sure there's food on the table they make sure that there's gas in the car but what about you who can intercede for you when you're interceding for everybody else preachers go through it when you get under the anointing you're preaching you're preaching making wa for liberty for other individuals but what about you and here stood Job saying what about me and not this hard time the Bible says he's asking questions if a man die shall he live again you know if I could only find him I would talk to him and you would know that this was bothering job because the very Channel God was working through he wasn't working through anymore but the brandom was said he had access to God's grace and here he was and when that channel closes you feel useless how many's ever been there when God is working through working through you as I feel that as a preacher and all of us H and the anointing dries up you go to study and you don't feel him no more you get up and preach you don't feel no anointing you feel like man what did I do wrong you am I out of the will of God man I'm telling you what me and my wife's been going through a late Li orot water heater went out or furnace went out but my truck broke down all of these things happened in two weeks and here my wife is hting what did we do wrong and so these things have really been speaking to me that it's not that we're out of the will of God it's the devil coming and trying to put fear that we chose the wrong direction but that is a Lie from the pits of hell if you found the will of God keep pressing if you found the will of God don't give up don't lay down don't turn around but keep on marching if you found the will of God for your family March hard if you found the will of God for your marriage march on if you found that the will of God is a Revival for your family march on to it keep pressing for it don't give up because of fear Hallelujah and what is so incredible is through all of this for job James would say look at the patience of Job through all of this and here job and I'm sure job could if he was alive then or could look from the banisters of heaven and would say patience what do you mean I was looking for God saying God why have you left me and you see the word patience in the Greek Lexicon is steadfast enduring perseverance so joob may may may may have may have felt like he God wasn't answering but he was still steadfast even though he could not feel God and you see that's something that we can grab a hold of even when we don't feel God we can still be steadfast we can still be enduring we can still have perseverance you see it's patience the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 6:12 that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises so faith and ations work hand in hand to achieve the promises that God has for us brother Brandon would tell us that the only way for your souls to get life is for patience you know no it's endurance perseverance steadfastness not a double-minded man that is here one day there another day but patience in the will of God that possesses the life of God and you see one one brother Brandon would tell us that there's two phases to Christianity you remember him talking about that he says one and the first and he says the first pH is an intellectual faith and he says but the second one is an experimental Faith where you've tasted of it you've tried God and you experienced him to be true and what is so incredible is that brother brandom says that one of those has a mental conception of what God Said in his word and he says the other one has experienced it and he says the first one can't keep the victory he says says he feasts on the things of God but he says his Feast does not hang out does does not keep on going he says he's hungering all the time but he then he says that second one seems to have Victory all the time he says nothing seems to bother him he says he's feasting upon God and he says there's nothing bothers them they are just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all and I like how brother Brandon puts it no trials no storms nothing bothers them it's not that they're not going through it but it's not bothering their soul you see remember the Brandon would tell us that we're Tri you and being right we're Body Soul and Spirit he says the body has has five senses sight taste smell hear and and and feel then he says your spirit man has five senses your imagination your conscience your reasoning your memory and your affection but then he says you've got the soul and he says there's only two in the soul which is faith and doubt and what I love about it is brother brandom says your faith rescues you from your five senses ain't that incredible so whenever your spirit man gets beat down that's why the Apostle Paul would say let us run this race with patience it's not when the spirit man gets beat down when the flesh gets beat down the soul is steadfast the soul is still steadfast and enduring even when the spirit man your imagination and your conscience and your reasoning your affection all of these things the devil's coming with fears whenever you can't see God feel God hear God tast him or whatever it is your soul is still persevering for the will of God that's why this message has got to go beyond your flesh beyond your spirit man to the soul cuz if it's on your flesh you may feel good but tomorrow your feelings going to go away if it's on your spirit man you may speak in tongues but that might be gone tomorrow but if it's in the soul when you're not speaking in song not speaking in tongues you're stabilized when you don't feel him you're still stabilized you see that's what with the Brandon would say you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still go to hell you can have the Holy Ghost upon your flesh upon your spirit but if it's not in the soul it's not going to stabilize you but if this message ever goes to the soul you can go through the valley of the shadow of death you can go through the fiery furnace you can go through the Lion's Den and you know that you are in the will of God that's right he guideth my steps he's the one that performthe amen you see our soul has been stabilized but the brand would say you know now now that that's your birth he says when you're a natural man or natural woman but when you're reborned again there the that's not the outside conscience the outside is what you see taste them out here but the inside is what you really are now this out here Satan tempts you and knocks you around every way here but he can't get down here unless you let him for in here you've got faith faith don't come from the outer conscience it reasons but in faith there's no reason you've got it from God and you know that it's there I don't care how much it looks wrong you still know it's right it's thus saith the Lord ain't that powerful Faith don't reason it points to thus saith the Lord which is the will of God you know brother the brand I'm going talk about Elijah and would say Elijah would go to Mount Carmel and and I seen a meme the other day and I thought it was pretty funny it would say that Elijah was the first Trash talker you sports players you know and it's always it's aggravating when you know you're better than somebody but they get into your head right they and this guy's good at it he talks trash and as he as he gets into your head you start to mess up and could you imagine Elijah sitting there and then the priest of bail hey call a little louder maybe he's on a picnic maybe he's on a journey and you can and you can just imagine their frustration is getting up and up and they're starting to cut themselves oh cut yourself if that's what it takes go ahead and do it brother brandom says he was confident because he saw by Vision he had got the victory and so since he's seen by Vision he was persevering no matter the opposition that was against him and we've got a vision in this generation it don't matter the opposition that comes against your spirit man that comes against your flesh the soul is looking into the Unseen realm and says I'm stabilized it don't matter what I go through there's nothing that can keep me out of the will of God I'm stabilized in church this morning morning you can be so stabilized that whenever your child gets sick you can pray for him and God heals that prayer Hallelujah if you got a lost loved one that is out in drugs and alcohol you can still believe it's because you're believing from the soul not from the spirit man not from the flesh but from the soul hallelujah hallelujah that's where all things are possible in the soul there's no emotions to the soul oh hallelujah oh bless the Lord Glory no emotions to the soul you see because if we walk by emotions when we're happy you know I don't got it with me but I was looking at and there's emotions there there's multiple emotions and one that really stood out to me was happiness and it says when you're happy you're content and I thought wow that really donees something for me cuz I thought what about if you're not happy are you you're content still you know so if you're walking by your emotions your contentment is if you're happy and I think it was the Apostle Paul would say in whatever state I am in I have learned to be content so even when his emotions was up and was down when he was being scored being beaten being leted out of a w City out of a basket you know he was still content not from the emotions but from the soul you see and there's no reason in faith but the Brandon would say Jesus was walking in another world with perfect Faith ain't that incredible he was walking in another world and he says in this world he was walking where there was perfect faith and he says because he was walking in this realm virtue was coming out of his garments and he says that's the reason that the woman with the issue of blood would touch His Garment virtue would come come from him to that girl he would say it was because he was walking in another world and then he would not just stop he says now if you abide in me and through through him who brought us the word to you my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of way virtues flowing from you rivers of God's Fountains of blessings flowing out of the people see what I mean you're not bluffing you're not imagining it it's actually taking place you see it if you're just imagining it that don't do any good but if it's TR there it's really happening and then he would say so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and so the very Dimension that Jesus would live in spiritually you've been invited to go to that place yeah oh even when your flesh is upon the Earth you can walk into another dimension where your soul is stabilized and brother the Brandon would tell us that then you got virtues coming out of you ain't that incredible that you can pray for the sick and they shall recover and but the Brandon would say not just the pastor but deacons or trustees but he says this means the Ley every individual walks in the world with God Alone every individual walks in the world with God alone you don't got to be a preacher you don't got to be a Sunday school teacher you don't got to be a deacon but if you've got perseverance him the soul and you're walking by faith you walk in another world alone with with God that's why nothing bothers the bride you see it's not that you're not going through things you see where the brandom talks about the wife that prayed for a dead husband y'all remember that brother Brandon would say that this husband had died he had a heart attack and he says he was a heavy man his eyes would go back into his head and he would lay down and would die and brother the brandom says this little woman would jump upon him and says I would not stand for it and he says life would come back to that husband I thought my goodness what about today when there's individuals that is ripening under the authority of the son where's your faith at come on where's your confidence and I won't stand for it when the enemy comes in like a flood I will not stand for it I don't care what comes against my mind I am not standing for it oh I love it brother brandom says well it wasn't his time then I would not stand for it and called us back called his his life back in the name of Jesus he got well see why the six sense woke up Rose up I would not stand for it but the Brandon would say perfect Faith Masters all circumstances and what's incredible is he would say no matter what it is it Masters it and you would almost think that he is talking about maybe controlling situations like you know uh I don't know what example you you could use like like changing situations but the brandom says that's not what it is but he says you see it's already got a masters faith believes that God will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see and Masters all circumstances you see cuz too many times we look at that and think we need a miracle right now right if we don't get a miracle right now then God ain't heard my prayer but that's not what brother the brandom's talking about when he means by mastering is God we know God is going to work it out I don't know how God is going to do it but God is going to work it out that's what Masters every situation brother Brandon will tell us his greatest experience with God right is when he couldn't get underneath something couldn't get over something couldn't get around it but then God would show up and make a way through it right he he was perfect Faith mastering that situation when he could not see a way through it he believed that the Unseen could make a way through it and that's what has been given to the bride in this generation is perfect faith but the Brandon would say in that message perfect Faith he says now that's bride material he says perfect Faith that's bride material he says not wishy-washy but somebody that can Master it Master every situation Master the emotions Master the feelings of your senses whenever you can't you don't feel God you know God's there it's mastering it by A Perfect Faith you see it's patience but the brand must say he that ha in ear let him hear then he would say he that ha Faith leted him here and he says faith there's nothing that he says there faith says yes there's nothing can say no When God Says Yes and what's so incredible as is Revelations 3:10 would say because thou was kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee in the hour of Temptation so since you have kept my word in steadfastness I will keep you in the hour of Temptation you brother brownon would tell us the Temptation means to be tested tested so in the hour of being tested since you've kept my word with patience I will keep you and brother Brandon would say what does TH word mean by his patience he says he would talk about Abraham and would say he he obtained The Promise by patiently enduring he says see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word requires even more patience and he says in the case of Abraham he endured seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word was finally fulfilled that really spoke to my heart whenever I was studying on that brother brandom say or the Bible would say he endured with patience then brother brandom says he seen the invisible it was his patience enduring until he broke into that other dimension until he could see God face to face oh man so he could seek him maybe not with natural eyes but with Revelation he could see into that other dimension and you see but it took the patience it took it took took him enduring the press and you see but the Brandon would talk about the woman with the blood issue and but brother Brandon would say Jesus would stop and would say who touched me and he would say Jesus done that was because the lady felt like the like her blood dried up remember and brother brandom says in order to prove it to that lady he had to stop and said who touched me so him questioning her her faith brought her patience oh that no matter what the Skeptics would say her patience would endure and break through to the Unseen cuz why you know you know uh what if the Skeptics would have came up and said know you're just feeling good right now but tomorrow you're going to start bleeding again and what if the Skeptics would have just came and so beat her down and she lost her faith but brother brandom says he questioned her faith to prove it that no matter what she would go through it was already proven cuz God stopped and said who touched me then she would stop and out of Faith would say I touched you you see could you see the the faith mastering that situation I touched you fear would have been like don't raise your hand the disciples are going against you or you're you're you're an unclean woman the Master's going to will strike out against you you know what what if it was fear coming but Faith would rise up above the fear and would answer the call answer the challenge and would say I touched you oh Hallelujah he would say it was perfect faith that touched her and you see sometimes when when when God questions your faith you got to persevere through it and it's giv me a few more minutes here and you see sometimes we got to believe even when we don't see any results when we don't feel any better you see the Bible would tell us in Luke 24:49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tar ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you see the word Terry in the Hebrew means to stay abide to continue to stay in expectation so Jesus is saying behold I send the promise of my father but stay in expectation till it comes and I thought that's powerful cuz he promised it to come but you have to stay in expectation and many times we get promises but we fa to stay in expectation we expect it for today for tomorrow but then next week we start to lose our faith we start to lose our patience we start to lose our perseverance but you see somebody would ask brother brandom a question dear brother Brandon what is the difference when Jesus breathed on the disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and when they had to go to the upper room the ter he answers the question it was a promise he gave them breathed upon them his promise and said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise then they went to the upper room for the promise promise to be fulfilled same thing is when you laid your hands upon you to be healed then you got to go about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled so Jesus breathed on them and said receive ye the holy ghost that was a promise but then in order for them to receive that promise they had to go to the upper room and stay in expectation they had to T they had to have patience to persevere and oh my we need patience in this generation to persevere to stay in expectation the Rapture might not happen today but it's going to happen tomorrow if it don't happen tomorrow we're looking for it next week we're patiently enduring for the will of God to be fulfilled oh Hallelujah you see but it's hard to wait in faith sometimes you remember Daniel he he prayed for 21 days and could you imagine the Mind battles of Daniel he was a man of inspiration God would speak to him that was 21 days and we can't even pray through for 4 hours 3 hours 2 hours here Daniel is praying through for 21 days and then there came an angel that was says God heard you the first day but I had to fight for the Prince of Persia ain't that incredible that he had to fight through the spirits of the day for in order for Daniel to hear or for him to get his answer and sometimes we don't get the answer right away but it's on the way it's fighting through lukewarmness it's fighting through Leia it's fighting through doubt through unbelief but your answer is on the way you got to endure with patience with steadfastness in the soul be stabilized that no matter if it comes today I'm expecting to hear it from God and what's so incredible as the Bible says in Daniel 10:18 then came again and touched me one like the appearance of man and he strengthened me and oh and said oh man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto you be strong yay be strong and when he spoke unto me I was strengthened ain't that incredible that he was weakened because he was persevering but when his answer came it strengthened him whenever he spoke it was strengthen him and I think my goodness we've got an inspiration in this generation that is strengthening our faith muscles that when we get tired we're pressing we're believing but then there comes a strength you see that's what was strengthen job was when the voice of God would speak the voice of God always bring strength you remember whenever the maid had died Jeri's daughter the Bible would say Jesus would go in and what would Jesus do he would have all the unbelief go out of the house I think M that's what what God has done in this generation he has brought a message to remove all the doubt and what would happened the Bible says that he would go up and go up to to to the jus' daughter and would say Maiden rise he would speak to her and bring her to life then what would he do what would he do then would say give her some meat to eat he would strength same voice that brought her back to life would strengthen her and I we've got a strength in this generation by the voice of God the same voice that brought us out of a denominational tomb has strengthen Us by the voice of God you see and here would stand job and job would he would talk about the trees and the Botley life if they die the sense of water brings them back he asked the question if a man dies shall he live again he he was live without inspiration he was living in a mystery and I think it's so so incredible that here would come the Thunders we all know the story the Thunders would start to blare and brother brandom says when the Thunder be to Roar inspiration struck job everybody else heard Thunders but he heard more than Thunders he heard a voice and what would that voice do that voice would answered every question that job would have remember job would say if a man die shall he live again if I can only find God I will talk to him that was before inspiration but once the voice spoke through the Thunders he would say I know my redeemer liveth the very one he was looking for inspiration broken into the invisible where he could see him then what else would he say in my flesh I will see God his question was if a man die shall he live again then the answer would say in your flesh you're going to see me even though skin worms take over your body I'm giving you an answer you can see and be stabilized here's the will for your life is not to go into the grave and die there but you will see me once again the will for your life is on the other side of the trial God ain't meant for you to die in your tribulation die in your trial but job could look on the other side of this Affliction I will will be seeing God hallelujah you will be seeing God on the other side of your Affliction how come brother Josh we're stabilized we're stabilized I have heard but now I see I've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear and brother brandom you know what brother brandom says he says he was a man of vision so God would come and speak to him that's what he meant by hearing God by the hearing of the Year by then he says then he seen God not just he heard of him but then he seen him he broke into the invisible and but the Brandon would say this now we wonder if we could see God Is there a way we could see him now it was the only way God had a trying job out he said I have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear but now now I see thee with my eyes the vision of the invisible had been made plain the vision of the invisible had been made plain but what brought this on was the Thunders right everybody else just heard thunder job didn't hear just Thunder he heard the mystery that was in the Thunders and oh man we still got people looking around for the Thunders right what's the mystery of the Thunders but the Brandon would tell us that the mystery of the Thunder is the voice of God so job heard a voice that would bring inspiration that would answer every question that he was in we've had a voice in this generation that would answer every question that we are going through for the brand say the seventh angel Begins the sound begins with his message not a healing service but the message that follows the healing service so we didn't just get a healing service and prayer lines we got a voice of God in this generation that says hey I'm here to answer your questions I know you may feel like you're all by yourself but here I know you're looking for me you're looking for that friend that sticketh closer than a brother but here I'm revealing myself in this generation where you can see me where you can feel me then brother Brandon would say this here he seen that Vision talking about job and he said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day he'll stand on this Earth and he says I'm tying myself to that job was looking by Vision then he would tie himself to the will of God that God would reveal to him by the Thunders oh we got the mystery of the Thunders we got a message mess we got a voice it's time that we tie oursel to it that's why I believe this message is our absolute we can tie ourself to it and wherever this message goes I'm going with it whenever it goes back to God I'm tied to it if I if I go through hard times it's still with me you see we're tied to it and you see we're putting on we're putting on the strength brother brand say now then we can see that Jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the opening of the door of the open door the door opening what what what is that but a revelation of him and that Revelation is opening up to to bring us strength to illuminate the word and glorify his name so the revelation of Christ is bringing a strength so here would stand job or or sit job on his Ash sheep and he was still on his Ash sheep but now he would have strength to keep persevering cuz I know I know myself I I often thought that as soon as he heard the Thunders he was right off the he was right off the as sheap but he was still there but he had strength now that no matter what is so incredible that God would then reward job right because you notice that all of his friends would turn against him and what is so incredible is the Bible says right after God would speak to job he then he then speaks to his friends him says now I'm coming against y'all he says because y'all did not speak good of me like job did and that really done my heart good that he God was an oblivious to everything that job was going through he was there he was there even when he when the friends turned against him wife turned against him God was still there and after God would come and Inspire job he would then look to all the critics and would say now what about you he endured and you spoke evil of me but he still spoke good of me even when he did not feel me see me hear me he still spoke good of me God sees you when you're in the hard time he sees you when when the Mind battle says you're a secret sinner when the Mind battle says you're out of the will of God when friend says you done this wrong God's watching you and say oh yeah that's somebody that is still being steadfast still being patient still enduring even when they don't see me you see it was the revelation of Christ in this generation that would bring us strength and it's so incredible the Bible would say in Isaiah 52 And1 awake awake put on that strength oh Zion Put On th beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and unclean the second verse Shake thyself from the dust I love that because it says arise and put on thy strength then the next verse says Shake thyself from the dust what is it humanity is your dust but God has given us a strength in this generation where you can put on the strength in our eyes the Bible would say in Isaiah 16:1 arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee so it's something that we are putting on this message ain't just something in our imagination something that we hear but it's a strength that we are putting on you remember brother brandom talks about about blind bmus that he was a beggar and he said that he had a Beggar's cloak on right and he says whenever Jesus would come by he was begging and the cloak identified him as a beggar but once Jesus opened open up his eyes he says he wasn't a beggar no more he would take off that garment he didn't need that garment anymore cuz no longer was he begging but now he's overcoming and here the Bible is saying arise Shake thyself from the dust and put on thy strength you don't need the the the the Garment of humanity bringing you down and bringing you down put on the strength of this word and Shake thyself from the dust Shake thyself from your imagination Shake thyself from your reasoning and your cons and your affection and your memory the condemnation that comes up against you shake yourself from it and arise and put on thy strength you see we're claimed by the glory of the Lord but the brand would say but he but we who had been lost has been found and redeemed and claimed back brought out of the devil's Pawn shot by the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ we've been claimed our body has been claimed let let the musicians come we have been brother Brandon would say we are invited to share his glory Isaiah 6 and2 for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and the glory shall be seen upon thee the glory of the Lord shall be seen not the glory of the Dust the glory of the Lord you see we're not to glorify our flesh we're to glorify God In the Flesh oh and then job was a prime example of it he was still glorifying God even on his as sheep and that was on under the blood of bulls and goats what about today we can still glorify God and here job you know the Bible says everything was restored back twofold everything that he lost God would restore maybe the devil's taking your joy maybe he's taking your peace maybe he's taking your happiness the joy of your salvation but we've got an inspiration this morning that'll spoke through and says hey see me be stable ized in the soul don't don't let me just come on your emotions don't let me just come on your flesh and your spirit man but let me anchor anchor down into that soul that whenever you go when you face the world again you're stabilized how many wants to be that way this morning the Lord so stabilize me
