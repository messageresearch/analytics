And uh let's continue to remember Aunt Angie, Benabout, and uh Sister Betty Applegate. And then if you can think of anybody else, Praise the Lord. The Lord is so good to us and he does answer our prayers. And I I was telling Caleb, you know, we um Sister Angie and both Angie's, you know, been suffering so much in their bodies and and uh just always want to keep all of these, you know, we they might have ongoing uh uh problems, but it's not just a one prayer and forget about, you know, we want to always hold them up before the Lord in prayer. Father, we just want to thank you today. Thank you for the privilege of coming to your house, Lord. And the place, Lord, that your name is exalted.

And just ask that you would help her tonight. Lord, take the pain and the swellingness away so that she can recover and take care of her baby.

And Lord, ask that you would just hold her up and let her know, Father, that we love her and we miss her. And pray, Father, that you'd be with Sister Angie, Father, as she has been struggling there with her liver. And I ask God for believing you for a miracle.

You brought life to me. A child of darkness became a child of light. When my soul was so dry and I need to drink the waters of life you became to me. I am. I am. You said to me, I am alpha. I am omega. The in between. I am. I am. You said to me, "I'll be what it takes to meet your need." You were the widow's cruise of oil and all Elijah's meat. You were the shelter for brother Noah.

Ever magnify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name together. Glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. Amen. Is that what you've come to do tonight? Amen. Can we sing that song? The more that I surrender, the lighter my load. I'm not sure the key. Maybe you have. The more that I surrender, the lighter my load. And the more that I release my car, the more you take control, the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live, Lord, I love you more. Can we do a verse now? It gets easier to understand this road. I'm traveling down. No more wavering or wondering. I'm standing on solid ground. And I know I'm headed for my future home. The voice I hear is yours alone. Every day that I live, Lord, I love you more. Oh, the more that I surrender, the lighter my load, the more that I release my cares. The more you take control, the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. Heavenly Father, that's our desire tonight, Lord. So the more that we can let go of ourselves, Father, and submit to your word, God, I'm asking tonight that you'll help me do so, Lord. Help us to get ourselves out of the way, Lord. Take any pride, anything, Father, that can be in our hearts that can prevent us from being fully submitted to your word. Lord, do a heart check tonight. Father, may we all just have a a desire to get closer to you, Father. Help us to surrender, Lord, our our everything, Lord, our wants, our desires, our motives and objectives, Lord. And help us to rely on your word here tonight, Father. We love you, Lord. Just bless the reading of your word. In your precious name, we pray. Amen. And amen. And if you have your Bibles tonight, I'd like to turn to John 17 and verse 8. Like to say it's good to to see everyone here tonight. Amen. Appreciate Brother Caleb song leading. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thought he did a good job. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. First John 17 and verse 8. We won't keep you too long here tonight. says, "For I have given unto them the words that thou hast gavest me, and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didest sent me. I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine, and all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee, holy father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are. If we can jump down to verse 20 says, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word, that they may all uh that they all may be one, as thou our father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one. I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, &gt;&gt; that the world may know that thou hast sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me. Father, I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me. For thou lovest me before the foundations of the world. Oh righteous father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and thou hast known thee that thou hast sent me. and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word. If we could also turn, you may be seated tonight. Um turn to Colossians 1 and 27 and then 1 Peter 5 and5 and then we'll get started here tonight. Colossians 1 and verse 27. says, "To whom God hath made known what is the richest riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." And then one more passage of scripture, 1 Peter 5 and5. 1 Peter 5 and5. And tonight if we may take a little topic on on submission here tonight if we can submission. First Peter 5 and5 it says likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder. Yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility. For God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time. So we see that there is a season for humility. Amen. And a season for submission. That is the sewing season. And then there is a harvest time with the Lord's help where we will be exalted in due time. So first submission then exaltation. Amen. Do you believe that tonight? And we see that Christ was first subjected to the will of the father. He became one with the father's will and then he was exalted to the right hand of God in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; We begin to see since the fall of man in the garden of Eden. It seems that one of the hardest things for an individual to do is to submit themselves to a higher authority. Amen. But we find out that yet it is impossible for a person to experience true freedom outside of true submission to authority. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that here tonight? And Eve thought that she could experience a a greater freedom. She she thought that if she can do her own thing and and not not be submissive to God's word and she can be independent that she would truly be free. AND WE FOUND OUT because of her decision, she wasn't truly made free, but she was eventually dropped into bondage and death. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO TRUE FREEDOM CAN ONLY COME FROM GOD AND CAN ONLY be experienced when you're under the full submission of God and God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in order to maintain your freedom, you must stay in your position. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And we see that Queen Vashy wouldn't submit to her husband, the king. And then the power and freedom that she had as a queen was taken from her. We see that KING SAUL WOULDN'T SUBMIT TO THE VOICE OF GOD THROUGH PROPHET SAMUEL. Then the kingdom was removed from him. We we see that ACHEN STOLE A BABYLONIAN GARMENT, &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; And a golden wedge IN BABYLON. AND BECAUSE OF HIS LACK of submission to God, his whole family was put to death. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't just lose his individual freedom, BUT HIS ENTIRE FAMILY LOST THEIR LIVES. SO, WE SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBMITTING TO THE WORD OF GOD. IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL stay in their position. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says here, we we have a home life crisis. It seems that home life is running into shallow water. It used to be in a home that the father, the head of the house, would sit down of the morning and he would speak with his family and they would take out the old family Bible and read just a little bit and all gather around the table and pray. You just don't see that anymore. And when the day was done and Maul had the dishes washed, they would all gather in and read some of the Bible and and pray before going to bed. He said, "Juvenile delinquency certainly was a hard thing to find in those days." Okay, &gt;&gt; the boys all went to work in the fields and the girls helped mom with their washing down at the creek, but today we push a little button and the dishes are done, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And mom is in the car and gone off to a card party or or out ratting around over the streets and the work is done by a tractor. So we just don't have nothing but just a bunch of lazy idol people &gt;&gt; and the home life is so neglected till the Bible is laidback till they have to hunt for an hour to find one in many homes of America that go to church on Sunday morning for their religion for about 20 minutes and if the pastor takes about 30 minutes he's called on the board. What is it? Home life is running out. Amen. I read an article the other day and it says, "IF YOU HAVE A breakdown of biblical morality, you have a breakdown of the family." &gt;&gt; If you have a breakdown of the family, you have a breakdown of a nation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Galatians 5:9 says, "A little levan leavenventh the whole up." You you can see THAT IT COULD BE SOMETHING SMALL IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU MUST DEAL WITH. THAT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, &gt;&gt; YEAH, &gt;&gt; IT MAY SEEM SO SMALL AND AND INSIGNIFICANT IN YOUR LIFE, BUT IT CAN AFFECT YOUR WALK WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; And when YOU HAVE A FAMILY, I'M FINDING OUT ALMOST 15 years now we've been married, AND I'M FINDING OUT THAT MY DECISIONS THAT I MAKE DON'T JUST AFFECT ME NOW. IT AFFECTS MY WHOLE FAMILY. YEAH. &gt;&gt; POOR DECISIONS, CHOICES THAT I'VE MADE IN LIFE, NOT WILLING TO LEAVE THE FAMILY HAS AFFECTED AND PUT SCARS ON MY MY MY CHILDREN AND MY WIFE BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF MY POSITION. &gt;&gt; SO STAYING IN YOUR POSITION IS IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE TRUE AND LASTING FREEDOM ONLY COMES BY SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YES. JAMES 4:7 SAYS, "SUBMIT YOURSELF TO GOD, RESIST THE DEVIL, and he will flee from you." SO, WE SEE THE FORMULA FOR VICTORY OVER THE DEVIL FIRST BEGINS WITH SUBMISSION. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WANT TO RESIST THE DEVIL, BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO SUBMIT TO GOD. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; WE SEE IN THE BIBLE THAT SEVEN WOMEN TOOK ONE MAN AND WANTED HIS NAME. THEY WANTED HIS POWER, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SUBMIT THEIR LIFE TO THAT NAME. HELLO, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED THE BENEFITS OF THE NAME. THEY WANTED THE AUTHORITY THAT CAME WITH THE NAME, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SUBMIT THEIR LIFE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SUBMIT THEIR WAY OF THINKING AND THEIR IDEAS AND AND WHAT THEY THINK LIFE SHOULD BE LIKE. &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED THE BLESSINGS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED THE POWER THAT COMES WITH THE NAME OF GOD, BUT THEY WEREN'T WILLING TO SUBJECT THEIR LIFE TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH MY. THEY wanted to do their own thing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, WE HEAR IT TODAY. WELL, WE DON'T NEED THAT scripture anymore. OR &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED THAT QUOTE ANYMORE. BE CAREFUL. BE CAREFUL. THEY WANT THE BLESSINGS OF IT. &gt;&gt; And if I can say this here tonight, I won't keep YOU LONG. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CANNOT RECEIVE THE GENUINE HOLY GHOST AND REJECT THE WORD OF GOD AT the same time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE YOURSELF FIGHTING IN THE WORD OF GOD, WELL, I don't believe it that way and well, I don't need that scripture OR I DON'T NEED THAT QUOTE. I WOULD CHECK YOUR EXPERIENCE &gt;&gt; AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SAY YOU HAVE. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, NO MATTER HOW HARD IT PRICKS YOUR HEART AND NO MATTER HOW HARD THE PASTOR STEPS ON YOUR TOES, YOU WILL LINE YOURSELF UP WITH THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST ONLY RECEIVES THE FULL WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ONLY SUBJECTS ITSELF TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AND WE SEE THAT SUBMISSION I hope this is okay tonight. &gt;&gt; BUT WE SEE SUBMISSION IS TO THE WORD OF GOD IS THE FIRST STEP TO RESTORING peace to a family. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's also a it can give peace to a nation. It gives peace to a church. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we see when a nation refuses to stay with the laws and the word of God, THEN THERE'S TROUBLE THAT COMES FOR THAT NATION. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT GOD IS MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS THAT EVEN WHEN WE DO MAKE MISTAKES, WE SEE ISRAEL, THEY ALWAYS BACKSLID UPON GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THEY TURN BACK TO GOD AGAIN, GOD WAS THERE TO PICK THEM UP. WE MAY FALL. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; WE MAY HAVE TROUBLES AND MISTAKES. I MAY AS A LEADER OF THE HOME MAKE MY MISTAKES. BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT GOD IS MERCIFUL. &gt;&gt; THAT HE DOESN'T LEAVE US THERE, BUT HE PICKS US UP AGAIN. WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE A BEATING. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; WE MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SEEDS THAT WE SOWED. BUT THROUGH GOD'S MERCY, HE CAN RESTORE A FAMILY AS LONG AS THAT PERSON IS WILLING TO SUBMIT their life to God. &gt;&gt; BUT IT COMES TO THE HEART. ARE WE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO GOD? AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; We know a LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY ARE ARE TRYING TO FIND A RELIGION that fits their lifestyle. &gt;&gt; They want to go to A CHURCH THAT THAT IS OKAY WITH HOW THEY LIVE. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; THAT ONLY GOD ONLY LOOKS AT THE HEART. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, I I WANT TO GO TO A PLACE WHERE THERE'S CORRECTION IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IF I'M WRONG, GOD CORRECTS ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF I IF I NEED TO LEAD MY FAMILY AS WE HEARD SUNDAY, THEN GOD CHANGE THE DIRECTION. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T ALLOW ME TO JUST TO GO THROUGH LIFE THINKING I'M OKAY. &gt;&gt; GOD WON'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A TRUE DAUGHTER AND SON OF GOD, GOD WON'T LET YOU GO THROUGH LIFE THINKING YOU'RE OKAY. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WILL BRING YOU DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S MERCY. &gt;&gt; YES, HE WILL. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, HOW DO YOU KNOW? I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT. I WAS GOING THROUGH LIFE DOING MY OWN THING. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS GOD'S MERCY THAT REACHED DOWN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I WAS OKAY. I'M A PASTOR'S SON. I I PLAY MUSIC IN THE CHURCH. I I I LEAD SONGS. I I'M OKAY. BUT WE FOUND OUT THAT YOUR ABILITIES IS NOT WHAT SAVES YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHAT SAVES YOU AND WHAT KEEPS YOU ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW IS THE HOLY GHOST DOWN DEEP INSIDE THAT'S THAT'S CHECKING YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN WE MAKE MISTAKES, repent and get up again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Dad mentioned this Sunday, but every family, it is God, it is man, it is woman, and it is child. 2 Corinthians 11:3 says, "But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God." Ephesians 5:22 says, "Wives, submit yourselves unto your husbands as unto the Lord." Ephesians 6:1, "Children, obey your parents." I hope this is okay tonight, &gt;&gt; for this IS RIGHT. HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and thou that thou mayest live long on the earth. &gt;&gt; And you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admiration of the Lord. Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, and in singleness of heart as unto Christ. So we see a united family is very powerful. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, IT IS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DESIGNED THE FAMILY UNIT AND THE FAMILY IS WHAT GOD IS EXPRESSED IN HIMSELF &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY. GOD CANNOT BE FULLY REVEALED BECAUSE GOD IS A FAMILY. HOW MANY CAN SAY THAT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I FEEL TONIGHT THAT THIS CHURCH IS A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WE MAY HAVE OUR UPS AND DOWNS. WE WE MAY HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS AND ARGUMENTS, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S POWER IN UNITY. SATAN WANTS TO DESTROY UNITY. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO DESTROY THE NATURAL FAMILY AS WELL AS THE SPIRITUAL FAMILY. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; HE'S TRYING TO BRING DIVISION WITHIN THE CHURCH. HELLO, SOMEBODY. AND IF HE COULD KEEP US BICKERING AT ONE ANOTHER, HE'S GOT US DEFEATED. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POWER AND UNITY. WHY DO YOU THINK SATAN IS TRYING TO BREAK IT UP? BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE POWER THAT LAYS WITH INSIDE UNITY IN THIS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE MAY GET TIRED. WE MAY GET WEARY, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S EACH OTHER THAT IS LIFTING ONE ANOTHER UP AGAIN. &gt;&gt; It's unity. WE DON'T LEAVE THE OTHER TO THE SIDE. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE FALL, WE UNITE TOGETHER TO BRING THAT ONE UP AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT A FAMILY DOES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; We see that Satan is trying to take out the shepherd of the flock. We heard that Sunday. I hope this is okay. I just felt to go this way. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 34 and5 it says, "And they were scattered BECAUSE THERE WAS NO shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered." Satan is trying to take out the shepherd. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He knows if he can take out the shepherd, what's going to happen TO THE FLOCK? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF A CHURCH HAS NO PASTOR? &gt;&gt; SURE. &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; Without a shepherd, THE SHEEP SCATTER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE'S TRYING TO TAKE OUT THE SHEPHERD OF THE HOME BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF HE TAKES out Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. YEAH. &gt;&gt; I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE WHAT happens &gt;&gt; when the shepherd is taken OUT OF THE HOME. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YOU WATCH A FAMILY FALL APART &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT THE FAMILY IS SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WILL DIVIDE THE church against the pastor and the pastor against the church and MEMBERS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. I'VE SEEN IN THIS MESSAGE WHERE THE MINISTRY IS UNDER ATTACK. AND IF YOU HAVE A PASTOR THAT'S IN THE WILL OF GOD, HE WILL BE UNDER ATTACK. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, "But by one spirit, we're all baptized into the body." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And that body is a family, the family of God. And that's the house of God. And the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ. The name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The righteous run into it and are saved. He says here and here you are a person. I'm preaching the word saying that he's not dead. He's alive. He's alive and he's identified himself in our flesh. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Human flesh like he did back then. See, all that God was, he poured into Christ. All that Christ was, he poured into the church. That's him. Christ in us. HE SAYS, "OH GOD, IF THE WORLD COULD see that man and GOD ARE ONE, THE SUPER SIGN WAS THE FIRST MAN THAT GOD COULD COME INTO. AND ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED INTO CHRIST. AND ALL THAT CHRIST WAS, HE POURED INTO THE CHURCH. IT'S A SUPER SIGN. GOD AND MAN TOGETHER. That was the super sign of the last day WHEN THE ENTIRE BIBLE WAS TO BE fulfilled in the last day." So, we see that THE PURPOSE THAT WAS IN GOD'S MIND FROM THE BEGINNING WAS TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS himself through a many membered body. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED a family. Ain't that right? I know this is simple tonight and I'll try to shut IT DOWN FAST, BUT GOD WANTED A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; HE HAD ATTRIBUTES THAT THAT IDENTIFIED HIM AS A HEALER AND AND A FATHER, BUT HE COULDN'T DISPLAY THOSE ATTRIBUTES. &gt;&gt; YEAH. SO, WE SEE THE PLAN OF GOD THAT THAT CAUSED THE FALL OF MAN. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED SOMEONE THAT HE COULD TALK LIP TO EAR WITH. OH my &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; SO, THE GREAT PLAN OF GOD BEGIN TO UNFOLD. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AND WE SEE THAT GOD THROUGH TIME HAS NOW MADE A WAY FOR MAN TO COME BACK TO GOD AGAIN. &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS CHRISTMAS WHERE WHERE CHRIST WAS BORN. &gt;&gt; MADE A WAY FOR MAN AND GOD TO BE UNITED AGAIN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF GOD'S GREAT REDEMPTIVE PLAN. &gt;&gt; YES. YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND NOW WE SEE THAT MAN OF GOD HAS RELATIONSHIP AGAIN. BUT THE ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FULL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD IS TO HAVE A FULL SUBMISSION to his word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOT OUR OWN IDEAS, NOT OUR OWN THINKING, &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT WHO NOT WHAT THIS PERSON SAID OR THAT PERSON SAID, BUT WHAT THIS BIBLE SAYS. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; WE LIGHT UP OUR LIFE WITH THIS. &gt;&gt; There you go. AND WE SEE NOW THAT HE IS IN ANOTHER form today. SHE IS HIM. THEY CAME TO JESUS AND SAID, "SHOW US THE FATHER." AND JESUS SAID, "HAVE I NOT BEEN WITH YOU FOR SO LONG? WHEN YOU'VE SEEN ME, YOU SEE THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORLD WANTS TO SEE GOD, WHO DO THEY LOOK TO?" &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THEY LOOK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOW GOD DWELLING IN FLESH AGAIN. YEAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HELLO SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; HELLO, PREACHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, WE SEE THE PURPOSE, SATAN'S PURPOSE FROM THE BEGINNING WAS TO DISRUPT THIS PLAN. HE KNEW. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; He knew if he g IF IF MAN AND GOD GOT BACK TOGETHER, HE KNEW WHAT WOULD TAKE PLACE. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU THINK HE FIGHTS SO HARD? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. HE KNOWS. HE'S SCARED. HE'S SCARED OF WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE WHEN YOU BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE WHO YOU ARE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND YOU REALIZE THE SAME AUTHORITY THAT JESUS CHRIST HAD ON EARTH &gt;&gt; is the SAME AUTHORITY YOU HAVE HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THE DEVIL HAS BROUGHT DESTRUCTION on the first family. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Satan knows that God I hope this is okay. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT GOD CREATED A MARRIAGE AS A A beautiful living picture of Christ in the church. AND SATAN KNOWS THE VALUE OF FAMILY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; And he knows if HE CAN SUCCESSFULLY TEAR IT APART, take away unity again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you see what HAS HAPPENED? HE'S BROUGHT DESTRUCTION. &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. HE'S BROUGHT DESTRUCTION TO THE NATURAL FAMILY BECAUSE he knows the IMPORTANCE OF IT. YOU WANT TO SEE VICTORY WITHIN A CHURCH, bring a spirit of unity back in the church again. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; You want to SEE VICTORY IN YOUR HOME, BRING A SPIRIT OF UNITY BACK INTO THE HOME AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND YOU WATCH WHEN YOU BRING CHRIST BACK IN THE HOME AGAIN. OH MY. YOU WATCH A FAMILY THAT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL COME BACK TOGETHER AGAIN BECAUSE GOD IS THE ONE THAT'S HEALING THE FAMILY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS MEANT TO DESTROY YOU, BUT GOD HAS KEPT YOU TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; And it LOOKS LIKE THAT SATAN HAS SUCCEEDED. OH MY. BUT GOD HAS KEPT YOU TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Thank God for HIS KEEPING POWER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW I'M TOGETHER WITH MY WIFE IS GOD KEPT US TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Oh my. I don't think any of us would be here if it wasn't for God's keeping power. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And if I can say this tonight, I'M I'M SICK and tired of seeing the devil have his way with the family. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; I'M SICK AND TIRED OF OF HIM HAVING HIS WAY WITH MY WIFE AND MY CHILDREN AND CAUSING CHAOS IN THE HOME. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S TIME WE TAKE A STAND AND SAY, "SATAN, YOU CAN'T HAVE MY HOME ANY LONGER. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE MUST FIGHT FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; My my my. There's power in unity. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says a person can live so close to God that the devil wouldn't know what to do with him. &gt;&gt; If I CAN SAY THIS, A CHURCH, A FAMILY CAN LIVE SO CLOSE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT THE DEVIL WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOU. YOU COULD BE SO CLOSE TOGETHER AS A FAMILY THAT SATAN WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME THAT WE GET THAT RESOLVE BACK IN THE CHURCH AGAIN, BACK IN OUR FAMILIES AGAIN, AND SAY, "I AM MAKING NO ROOM FOR THE DEVIL." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. All right. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT HURTS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; SATAN WILL HAVE NO WIGGLE ROOM ANY LONGER. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; OH MY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a saying, how long have I been up here? &gt;&gt; There's a saying. It says, "United we stay, undivided we fall." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And there's two parables that are are with this saying. And it says here, "The four oxen and the lion." It says, "The lion used to prowl about a field in which four oxmen used to dwell." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Many a time he tried to attack them, but whenever he came near, they turned their tails one to another, so that whichever way he approached them, he was met by the horns of one of them. At last, however, they fell a quarreling among themselves, and each went off to pastor along in the separate corner of the field. &gt;&gt; Then the lion attacked them one by one and made an end to all four. Satan is smart and how he strategizes. &gt;&gt; He's not stupid. He knows when we're united and we have a united front, THERE'S NO WAY he can penetrate our forces. I believe that &gt;&gt; there's no way when we're standing shouldertosh shoulder, ARM TO ARM, NO MATTER OUR DIFFERENCES, WE'RE SAYING WE ARE GOING TO UNITE TOGETHER. NO MATTER &gt;&gt; WHAT IT TAKES, we're not going to let Satan in. BUT ONCE THEY STARTED TO BICKER among themselves, &gt;&gt; MY &gt;&gt; THAT UNITED FRONT, THAT STRENGTH, THAT STONE WALL THAT THEY HAD, &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WAS NOW BROKEN APART. AND IT SAYS HERE, "THE LION TOOK ALL FOUR of them one BY ONE. FOR WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. SATAN CAN come in and take us out ONE BY ONE BY ONE." I'VE SAID IT BEFORE. ISOLATION IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. IT'S THE ENEMY'S TOOL. &gt;&gt; IF HE CAN GET us isolated. &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. THINKING THAT WE'RE NOT LOVED, WE'RE NOT ACCEPTED, THAT NOBODY CARES, NOBODY NEEDS US. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE ISOLATE OURSEL from the pack? &gt;&gt; Satan can come in. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE WEARY, STAY UNITED. &gt;&gt; EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TIRED AND YOU YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU COULD GO ON, THAT'S WHAT FAMILY IS FOR. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. &gt;&gt; But he will hit you at your lowest. The other one here says THIS SHORT FABLE TELLS OF A MAN WHOSE SONS often quarreled among themselves to show the benefit of to show them the benefit of working together. He brings a bundle of sticks. He asked them to break the bundle of sticks. As expected, the brothers could not break the sticks when they were together. However, they can easily be broken individually. The moral of the story is written. He says, "My sons, you are of one mind and unite to assist each other. You will be as this bundle, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; Uninjured by all attempts of your enemies. BUT IF YOU ARE DIVIDED among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks." &gt;&gt; So we see the importance of being unified together, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Of a family. I'm going skip some of this here and say our our biggest enemy is ourselves. How many can say that tonight? &gt;&gt; WHEN WE FAIL TO BE IN SUBMISSION, IT'S NOT MY WIFE, it's not the pastor, it's it's not your your the individuals in a church, but it's yourself. You can bring change within a family. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BRING A FIRE WITHIN A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF WE CAN BRING OURSELVES UNDER THE FULL WORD OF GOD, IT'S AMAZING HOW GOD CAN USE THAT INDIVIDUAL. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH, they are. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Colby, I I make mistakes. We're, you know, we're human. We make mistakes." But &gt;&gt; do we want TO BE LIKE SAUL OR DO WE WANT TO BE like David? &gt;&gt; All right. WE COULD BE LIKE SAUL WITH THE ATTITUDE, WELL PROPHET, HONOR me in front OF THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; JUST HONOR ME. BECAUSE OF HIS PRIDE, HE LOST THE KINGDOM. BUT DAVID, &gt;&gt; YEAH, &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS DAVID WAS A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART. REALIZE THIS. SAUL ONLY MADE ONE MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF HIS PRIDE, WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; HE LOST THE KINGDOM. DAVID MADE MULTIPLE MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; YEAH. RIGHT. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS ATTITUDE, &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE HEARD, "YOU'RE THE MAN." &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE RIPPED HIS CLOTHES AND HE CRIED OUT TO GOD FOR HIS MERCY. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF HIS heart of humility. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Not, well, I'm caught in the mistake, so I'm sorry. But no, HIS HEART WAS, GOD, I AM WRONG. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; I am wrong. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. And he SAYS, "I WOULD RATHER FALL IN THE HANDS OF GOD THAN THE HANDS OF MAN." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE THE MERCY IS. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We make mistakes, but friends, we must fall into the hands of merciful God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL BRING US BACK together again. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him here tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Now the first man and first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve." Now that is perfect oneness. God and his creation, God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve. And they were so perfect in HARMONY WITH GOD TILL they were one with God. &gt;&gt; God and his family was one. And any man in his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient family is one with another. Any family. And if there's something in that family that moves them apart, then that's not right. The family is broken somewhere. They should all be one. Father with mother, mother with father, children with parent, parent with child, all in agreement. And when you see that, you'll see one lovely picture. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOD'S PURPOSE. and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; His earthly family, Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. &gt;&gt; So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God, they became all one. Isn't that A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE? GOD and his family. Father above all, supreme. No death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing. Just joy unspeakable. My, what a time. Never to be sick, never to have a heartache, just one with God. What a picture. Because the very nature of God was in these people. And therefore, what they did, they followed just in line with God and God with them making them one. &gt;&gt; My amen. WE SEE THAT GOD DESIGNED MAN TO BE GOVERNED FROM THE inside out. &gt;&gt; Dad wrote a song. Write your word on the pages of my heart. Dear Lord, LET ME HIDE THEM FOREVER AND NOT LET THEM GO. WE UNDERSTAND THAT CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN FROM THE INSIDE OUT. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WANT TO CHANGE FROM THE OUTSIDE IN. IF IF THEY CAN LOOK HOLY ON THE OUTSIDE AND LOOK SPIRITUAL AND AND LOOK OKAY ON THE OUTSIDE, THEN THEY'RE SAVED. THAT'S NOT HOW GOD WORKS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO CHANGE THE MAN FROM THE INSIDE OUT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THAT WAY WHEN THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE, YOU DON'T REVERT BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM GOING BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO MY PRAYER IS, LORD, WRITE YOUR word on the pages of MY HEART TONIGHT. MAY I be able to be submissive even when I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; I gotta say, Sunday morning, I took a little of a beat in myself. Didn't mean that in a bad way. No, it was a good message. &gt;&gt; I needed it. I needed that for my own life. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Right, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Jeremiah 31:33 says, "But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, sayeth the Lord, I will put my law in the inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God, and they shall be my people." Brother Brandham says here, as I'm about to close, it says, "These battles have raged since the day of the Garden of Eden, the battle in the human mind. Satan started it. What did he do when he met Eve? He didn't deny God's word, but he whitewashed it. &gt;&gt; He stopped up some little channels here somewhere. And he said, "But surely God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if we're not careful, we'll allow Satan to talk us out of something. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Amen. as our musicians come now. Got a few more quotes and then I'll I'll be done here tonight. &gt;&gt; Appreciate your patience with us. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, he says, "Make the carnal mind," the carnal mind shuns it because the carnal mind doesn't know, does not know a thing about it. No wonder the carnal mind doesn't know it because it's Satan in that carnal mind. And Satan is exposed. And Satan does not want himself exposed. You know how horrible it is for Satan when he thinks he's going to be exposed. Watch in one of the services. Watch the action of the people. You watch out on a meeting just before Satan is exposed over a certain person. You'll see their face change. You see, they don't even know what to think. All once the Holy Spirit comes down and exposes the devil. Oh, he hates that kind of meeting. That's the reason we have such a battle because the word of God exposes the devil. See, it tells him what he is. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS SATAN FIGHTS harder every time something goes wrong because Satan is trying to keep the people in tension and everything else so that he can keep them away from this great strain that we're going to enter into for the great, as we would say, going in for the kill. Now, he's already beat up in the corner. He's already been exposed. How many thankful for that? And all of his devices are exposed and men and women has accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. He said, "Now here sits a group of people here tonight waiting under great anticipation." And Satan, if he can interrupt their mind, that's all he has to do. But let's go now for the great kill. Amen. And just now to drive Satan and all his powers out of the building. How about it tonight? How many can say, "Lord, I need I need a heart check tonight." Lord, help me to submit my life. Submit my heart, Lord. My thoughts, my ideas, my agendas. Father, help us, Lord, is our prayer. Can we sing that again? The more that I surrender as we turn it to our pastor tonight. Oh, the more that I surrender, the lighter my load and the more that I release my cares. The more you take control, the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live, Lord, I love you more. Oh, the more that I surrender, the lighter my load and the more that I release my cares. The more you take control and the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up every day I live. Lord, I love you more. Can we do a verse? And it gets easier to understand this road I'm traveling down. No more wavering for wondering. I'm standing on solid ground. And I know I'm headed for my future home. The voice I hear is yours alone. Every day that I live, Lord, I love you more. my prayer is. The more that I surrender, the lighter my load and the more that I release my cares. The more you take control and the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. Oh, the problems I had. Oh, yesterday is now a one stepping stone to a higher place. The trials that seem so awesome to me are now my better, a victory. And I know I'm headed for my future home. The voice I hear is yours alone. Every day that I live, Lord, I love you more. Oh, the more is that your cry tonight. Oh, the lighter my love. The more that I release my cares, the more you take control. And the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Then he walked you in. Satan's like, "Oh, Satan's like a roaring lion. Roance to and fro. He's seeking whom he may devour." The Bible tells us so. Many souls and many souls have been his prey to fall at some weak hour. But God has promised us today his overcoming power. Oh greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Hey, you alone When I fall, I'm so glad I got you. Oh, I'm going to lift up all together now. Oh, yes. Greater is he, Jesus. Greater How greater is he that is in me than he that is in me? Well, glory to God. Aren't you glad for the power of the Holy Spirit on the inside of you? This is not just the Holy Spirit upon your spirit man. Amen. Making you a religious person, but it's the Holy Spirit down on that predestinated soul. Amen. That's what empowers you to stand up. Amen. To to submit to God, resist the devil. Amen. And I'm thankful for that here today. Praise the Lord. Did you enjoy that tonight? That was wonderful. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
