[8:28] Amen. Do you love him here tonight?
[8:32] Amen. He certainly is wonderful, ain't
[8:34] he? Like to go to prayer if we may and
[8:39] ask brother Michael if he'd mind coming
[8:41] and leading us in prayer. We do have a
[8:42] few written needs. Um one from brother
[8:46] Mike. It is good to see brother Mike and
[8:48] sister niece here with us here tonight.
[8:50] Amen. I've been missing them.
[8:53] The one from brother Mike says, "Please
[8:55] pray for my wife. She has had an
[8:57] infection from surgery. So let's
[8:59] remember sister Denise in our prayer and
[9:02] also from sister Carol Alice Chapman uh
[9:06] hospital is sending her to hope on
[9:07] hospice and then for her granddaughter
[9:10] Sierra this morning her fiance died of
[9:14] overdose so let's remember them in our
[9:16] prayers and then she has Mariah and uh
[9:20] Carlina is that correct?
[9:24] Okay. So, let's remember them in our
[9:26] prayers and also um brother Seth
[9:29] Martin's wife
[9:32] just came to our attention that she's
[9:34] been in the hospital the last few days
[9:36] um that she's been having the same
[9:38] episodes that Zion has been having. So,
[9:41] Zion I believe was healed of that um
[9:44] during the prayer line um Saturday there
[9:47] at the Ohio camp, but then she started
[9:49] having it what the next day, Sunday. So,
[9:52] let's remember um Sister Rebecca Martin.
[9:57] That youth camp has made a lot of made a
[9:59] lot of demons and mad. So, it's been a
[10:02] lot of sicknesses coming out of that
[10:03] camp. So, let's just pray for that whole
[10:05] camp. Amen. That the that the Lord will
[10:08] come down and and touch everyone that
[10:10] was a part of that. And also, Sister
[10:12] Kathy, I don't know her last name, but
[10:14] the ones that were here this morning,
[10:16] um, she wanted me to put down a request
[10:20] here for her that she's having an EKG
[10:22] and an electric cardiogram tomorrow. So,
[10:26] let's remember Sister Kathy in our
[10:28] prayer. And also, Dad was mentioning the
[10:30] Lancaster family is doing better, but
[10:33] brother Harry is still struggling pretty
[10:35] hard. So, let's remember
[10:37] them in our prayers. mom is still um not
[10:41] doing well. So, let's just remember all
[10:43] the needs in this church. Amen. And if
[10:46] you have a need up on your heart, just
[10:47] make it known by the lifting of your
[10:49] hand. God bless you now.
[10:52] Amen. You love him here this evening.
[10:55] Just thinking about a lot of these
[10:57] requests that are being uh put out. You
[10:59] know, there's a lot of sick sick people.
[11:02] Uh we're going to pray for them and as
[11:05] brother Kobe was talking about that uh
[11:08] at Ohio camp. You know, some of the
[11:10] sisters have come up with same some of
[11:12] the same s symptoms that the other one
[11:15] has had. It just seems like there's
[11:16] really uh a push against what's been
[11:19] going on here, not only just in our
[11:21] church, but around the around the
[11:23] message in general. We see a lot of
[11:25] stirring that's going on around the
[11:28] around the uh message. A lot of people
[11:30] just kind of making their way back in
[11:32] and coming. But we know that when
[11:34] something like h that happens, a move of
[11:36] God happens that it produces twins. You
[11:39] know that every revival produces twins
[11:41] and where there's the good, there's the
[11:42] bad that's going to come along. So, it's
[11:44] important to keep those that are
[11:46] struggling and those that are going
[11:47] through some of these things just in
[11:48] prayer. And uh we're just uh glad for
[11:51] what the Lord is doing uh in our
[11:53] services and glad what he's doing all
[11:56] around. So, let's just bow our head and
[11:57] just keep our brother and sister in our
[11:59] in our hearts. Heavenly Father, we just
[12:01] love you, Lord.
[12:04] Father, we're appreciative, Lord. We
[12:05] just want to tell you how thankful we
[12:07] are, Lord, to just be in your house,
[12:10] Lord, to be of good, sound mind, Lord,
[12:12] health in our bodies, Father. And Lord,
[12:15] all the different all the different
[12:17] blessings that you've given us, Lord.
[12:19] And and Father, I would just ask that
[12:21] you would just see some of these
[12:22] requests. We know that the devil, he's
[12:25] going out, Lord, he's trying to devour,
[12:28] Lord, the seed of God out of our hearts.
[12:31] And Lord, the things that the words that
[12:33] have been planted through the ministry.
[12:36] Father, I would just ask God that you
[12:38] would just be with our sister Rebecca,
[12:40] Seth's wife. Father, Lord, you see the
[12:44] thing that she's going through in her
[12:45] body, Lord. And I would just ask that
[12:48] you would be there with Brother Seth. I
[12:51] would pray that you would give him,
[12:52] Lord, the words to speak to his wife,
[12:54] the patience, Father, and the eyes,
[12:56] Lord, to to see and understand
[12:59] everything that's been going on. And we
[13:00] would just ask that your sweet spirit
[13:03] would go down and it would just give
[13:04] peace to Sister Becca, Father. Lord, I
[13:07] would just pray that you would
[13:08] strengthen their little family, Father.
[13:10] and God that you would see us here in
[13:13] Pony and the different ones that are
[13:14] sick. The request from Sister Carol
[13:17] about our young lady's fiance just uh
[13:21] dying of an overdose. I would just pray,
[13:23] Father, that you would be in the
[13:24] situation. God, I would ask that your
[13:27] light would just shine over her, just
[13:29] lead her to the cross, that they would
[13:31] come and they would find that peace in
[13:33] your life, Lord, in your word. And I
[13:35] would ask, God, that you would see the
[13:37] ones that are missing in this building.
[13:39] You see, brother Duran, Lord, you see
[13:41] Sister Press. Lord, we're thankful to
[13:44] have Sister Denise with us. Thankful
[13:46] that you're just bringing her right out,
[13:48] Father, and that you're with Brother
[13:50] Mike and Sister Denise. That you
[13:52] continue to strengthen their bodies,
[13:54] Lord Jesus. Lord, continue to strengthen
[13:56] the bodies of the congregation. Thank
[13:58] you for being with us through the word
[14:00] that was preached this morning. And I
[14:02] would pray that you would just find good
[14:04] ground, Lord, to be able to come and
[14:06] manifest itself through us and be with
[14:09] us in our service. We're thankful, be
[14:11] careful to give you the glory and the
[14:13] honor in Jesus name. Amen.

[24:50] in the shadows of the alies.
[24:54] Oh,

[34:27] I say you may be seated?
[34:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Y'all may be seated. Praise
[34:32] the Lord. I appreciate the Lord's
[34:34] goodness and mercy. And I'm very, very
[34:36] thankful for getting saved in 1976,
[34:40] April the 8th, along here at Hippie. And
[34:42] God changed my life at Victory
[34:44] Tabernacle in Claremore, Oklahoma. and
[34:46] &gt;&gt; been going ever since and come to know
[34:48] the message later on and and God has
[34:51] been so good to me. I appreciate all the
[34:53] sister Martin here and brother Durn and
[34:56] brother Burus and all the different ones
[34:59] that led me to the Lord and still going
[35:01] strong after all these years through the
[35:03] through different battles and different
[35:04] storms and God God is good.
[35:08] And then the greatest thing is the when
[35:10] we got into the message and understood
[35:12] that God sent a prophet to this
[35:14] generation and he gave us thus said the
[35:16] Lord. So we know where we stand today.
[35:19] So I want to take a little thought in a
[35:21] first scripture in uh let's see I'm not
[35:25] trying to think it. Galatians 4:19
[35:27] and it says my little children in whom I
[35:30] travail in pain until Christ be formed
[35:33] in you.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; All right. my little children in whom I
[35:36] travail in pain till Christ be formed in
[35:39] you. And let's go to the Lord in prayer
[35:40] if you would. I'm not used to the
[35:42] orders. Y'all bear with me. So, our
[35:45] gracious heavenly father,
[35:47] &gt;&gt; yes.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Truly, Lord, we're thankful to be here
[35:49] tonight.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I'm thankful for the many
[35:52] friends and all the miracles we've seen
[35:54] over the years and thankful for the
[35:56] message that you've sent to us, Lord, in
[35:57] this day that gives us the strength, the
[36:00] grace, and the mercy to enter endure all
[36:02] things that come our way, Lord. And
[36:04] father I want to teach tonight Lord on
[36:07] reigning in life through the Lord Jesus
[36:09] Christ. We give the glory, the pray
[36:11] praise and honor Jesus name.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. So you
[36:17] see I guess we got to
[36:20] &gt;&gt; just obey the Lord.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Okay. Just get after
[36:25] Praise the Lord.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get used to this
[36:32] technology here.
[36:34] I'm getting over can't see.
[36:40] All right. So, the subject is tonight is
[36:43] reigning in life through the Lord Jesus
[36:45] Christ. And there's a message the Lord
[36:46] gave me several years ago and I've kind
[36:48] of preached it here and there sometimes,
[36:50] but uh and the first part of it in the
[36:53] scripture reading is Romans 15:12-
[36:56] 21. By one man's sin, by one man's
[37:00] righteousness. If you think about, you
[37:02] know, I'm just going to kind of pre
[37:04] preamble. There was one man that sinned
[37:07] in the garden in the beginning, and that
[37:08] was Adam.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; And where were you when Adam fell? Where
[37:13] was I when Adam fell?
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[37:15] &gt;&gt; we had nothing to do with it. But
[37:17] through one man's fall, we were born in
[37:19] sin. We were shaped in iniquity. We come
[37:22] into the world speaking lies.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; And how many of you have made mistakes?
[37:26] Or how many of us, we've all made
[37:27] mistakes in life? We've all done things
[37:29] we wish we wouldn't had done. And I
[37:31] could go through my whole life and
[37:33] think, "Lord, I wish I hadn't done this.
[37:34] I wish I hadn't done that." And all
[37:35] these different things.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "By one man's
[37:39] disobedience, we're made sinners."
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; By one man's obedience, we're made
[37:45] righteous.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe in holiness from head to
[37:47] toe, backward and forward and stuff. I
[37:49] was a long-haired hippie back in the
[37:51] day. I remember being in the church one
[37:53] time, one service after I got saved. I
[37:56] looked around the church and I thought I
[37:58] look like I look like one of the
[37:59] sisters.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; I had the long hair and of course I I
[38:03] was a hippie. I I looked like a sister.
[38:05] Nobody had to tell me nothing but I
[38:07] looked around and I didn't look like the
[38:09] brothers. So I was real skinny. I went
[38:12] got me a haircut and got cleaned up and
[38:14] brother Burr said, "You look like a
[38:15] matchstick."
[38:18] But anyway, God can change us. God's the
[38:20] one who changes us. We don't change
[38:21] ourselves. Yeah.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; And I could go through the whole
[38:23] testimony how, you know, began as a
[38:25] Methodist and Catholic and I've been to
[38:27] every kind of church, Baptist,
[38:29] Methodist, Pentecostal, Lutheran,
[38:30] Jehovah's Witness, 7th Day Adventist
[38:32] Church of Christ. I have literally
[38:34] visited them all. Mormons, you name it,
[38:38] I've been there.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And yet when end of the day, God sent a
[38:42] prophet to this generation.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; All right? And the scripture that got me
[38:46] was initially was uh some brothers had
[38:49] witnessed to me at the store we used to
[38:50] own back when I was about 20 something
[38:52] years old and I moved them on to 16. I
[38:54] work my way up and own the store and
[38:56] different things. But
[38:57] &gt;&gt; uh the brothers used to come in there
[38:59] and pray. They were from brother brother
[39:01] Bur's church.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; And one day brother John David Rhodess
[39:06] he gave me the scripture said it's not
[39:07] him that willth
[39:09] &gt;&gt; it's not him that runth
[39:10] &gt;&gt; but God that shows mercy. Yeah.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; And I and I kept hearing that and I kept
[39:16] hearing that and I thought that kept
[39:18] going through my mind. I thought, "Wow,
[39:20] not him that willth him that grindeth,
[39:21] but God that shows mercy."
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; And so the Lord kept dealing with me. I
[39:25] thought, "Oh my goodness, I don't know."
[39:27] So I told and then the brothers kept
[39:29] after me, you know, they come to the
[39:30] store and they said, "You going to come
[39:31] to church?" And I said, "Well, one of
[39:33] these days." And so one night they got
[39:36] me cornered and they said, "I'll tell
[39:37] you what, I'll be there Thursday night."
[39:39] So I told my wife, I said I said uh I
[39:41] told uh the boys there I'd be at their
[39:44] church Thursday night. She goes, "You
[39:46] told you told them?" I said, "Are you
[39:47] going with me?" She said, "Who told
[39:49] them?" I said, "I did." So goodbye.
[39:54] And I went and when I went, there was
[39:58] the Holy Ghost moving in the church. It
[39:59] was just like the old time
[40:01] &gt;&gt; power of God working.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And it was moving in the church. And I
[40:04] said, "My goodness, there's something
[40:06] different here."
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I did. I just went to visit.
[40:09] Yeah.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; I had my mind made up. I'm just going to
[40:12] visit. That's all I'm here for. So I
[40:14] went and I sat there. All of a sudden,
[40:17] somebody prophesied in tongue. Sister
[40:19] Elder Burst. Prophesied in tongue. And
[40:21] then the interpretation was, "Yay, my
[40:23] son. I have called you this night. Come
[40:26] give me your heart." And I thought, "Who
[40:29] is that for?"
[40:31] I look around trying to pick. I didn't
[40:33] even know what it Pentecost was.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; So who's that for?
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and come again said, "Yay, my son.
[40:38] I've called you this night. Give me your
[40:40] heart." And I thought, "Wonder who's
[40:43] this for?" I kept feeling a tug. And
[40:45] finally, I said, "Well, Lord, if that's
[40:46] for me," and then the only way I knew to
[40:48] say it, let somebody lay a hand on me.
[40:51] [Laughter]
[40:53] I ran to the altar and baldled like a
[40:55] baby, gave my heart to the Lord, just
[40:57] crying and come up shouting and praising
[40:59] the Lord.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; And that's a a new birth. Brother Ron
[41:02] said, "A new birth is messy."
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, we get kind of starchy over
[41:07] time,
[41:08] &gt;&gt; but the oldfashioned Holy Ghost is still
[41:10] real.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; And God sent a message with the truth
[41:13] and the word. We got all that, but we
[41:14] still need the oldfashioned power of God
[41:16] to change our life and to help to mold
[41:19] us and make us into the image of the
[41:20] Lord Jesus Christ.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "As you have born the
[41:24] image of the earthly,
[41:26] &gt;&gt; so shall you also bear the image of the
[41:28] heavenly."
[41:29] &gt;&gt; And I was preaching when I used to
[41:31] travel on business all for years. God
[41:33] worked me up from a bus boy to the
[41:35] corporate level in business for several
[41:37] years and I used to fly all over the
[41:39] country and I and I'd preach in
[41:41] different churches, little churches here
[41:42] and there and I was preaching it was a
[41:44] message church in I forget what Indiana
[41:46] or some place but it was a brother
[41:48] sitting on the front row and I said
[41:50] brother I said where'd you get that face
[41:52] and he was just you know like what I
[41:56] said as you bore the image of the
[41:57] earthly you'll bear the image of the
[41:59] heavenly
[42:00] &gt;&gt; so you bear that face come on you just
[42:02] because that's how you going to look.
[42:04] You didn't plan how you're going to
[42:06] look. You you look like you're going to
[42:07] look because God said this is your way
[42:09] you're going to look.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[42:10] &gt;&gt; So, same way it is when you're born into
[42:12] the spirit of God, God knows who you
[42:15] are. He knows what you're called for. He
[42:17] knows what your purpose is for. And I
[42:19] know so I know the people that brother
[42:22] Wendle used to go preaching here,
[42:25] preaching here, preaching there. He's
[42:26] still preaching, going strong. I know
[42:28] that God has called that young man to be
[42:30] what he is. Now, I'm not no preacher
[42:32] like any of those pre I'm not a preacher
[42:34] like all these. I did the jail ministry
[42:36] for 10 years and different things. I was
[42:38] in outreach and doortodoor and
[42:40] &gt;&gt; I know me and brother Michael Moore was
[42:41] out. I'm going different than I planned,
[42:43] but that's what
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But but brother Michael Moore, we
[42:46] he and I used to go witnessing and uh we
[42:49] walk we was walking past
[42:52] a veterinarian shop one day in Clmore.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh this little lady in the had
[42:56] was in a in a car and she was balling
[42:59] because she had a little old dog of hers
[43:01] and that little dog had died on her and
[43:04] she was crying. So we stopped by there
[43:06] and said, "Ma'am, can we help?" Because
[43:07] me and Brother Michael used to go
[43:08] witnessing door to door everywhere. We
[43:11] went to everybody's house
[43:13] &gt;&gt; and uh I had people going to hit me over
[43:15] the head a few times. But but anyway, I
[43:17] said, "Ma'am, are you okay?" She goes,
[43:19] "No." She said, "I'm not. My my dogs
[43:21] just died and the vet ain't here.
[43:23] Nobody's here. And I said, "Well," I
[43:25] said, "Would you like us to pray?" And
[43:27] she said, "Would you do that?" She We
[43:30] did. We prayed. That little dog come
[43:32] alive. It it breathed a few times and
[43:34] come alive.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; We didn't say nothing to nobody. We
[43:37] didn't go around bragging say, "Look
[43:38] what God doing."
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; We didn't do all that.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; But we were in church later. It was uh
[43:43] well, I can't remember the brothers now.
[43:45] Him and his wife started coming later.
[43:47] But anyway, they come to church a few
[43:48] years later or maybe a little while
[43:50] later. I don't remember how long. And
[43:52] they uh the lady says, "Can I testify?"
[43:55] She turned out to be a United
[43:56] Pentecostal lady who had backslid.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; She said, "Can I testify?" And and the
[44:00] brother Bur said, "Yeah." So she stood
[44:02] up. She goes, "That brother on the drums
[44:04] up there and that brother right there
[44:05] come by and told her about what happened
[44:08] there." And you know, she anyway she she
[44:10] kind of was telling about it. You know,
[44:12] &gt;&gt; you know, God still does miracles. Sure.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; You know, God still, you know, we need
[44:17] the word, we need the truth, and we need
[44:20] the the power of God.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; We need, you know, you know that song
[44:24] says, "Time after time, I hear people
[44:28] say to me,
[44:30] &gt;&gt; why don't we see miracles
[44:33] like we used to see?"
[44:35] &gt;&gt; I still believe in miracles. God hears
[44:39] us when we pray. Because God was God
[44:42] back yesterday and he's still God today.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; He will do it again and again and again.
[44:52] Is the same God today as he always has
[44:57] been. Yesterday, now forever. He's
[45:01] always the same. There's no reason to
[45:05] doubt. God will do it again. And I've
[45:10] seen many, many, many miracles
[45:12] &gt;&gt; that God has done in our life.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; I could write a whole book on it, but I
[45:16] like people telling me ought to write a
[45:17] book. I say everybody write books.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; I don't need to write no book.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And I don't want nobody to know all my
[45:23] good, bad, and ugly.
[45:26] I wish had made mistakes.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Anybody Anybody in here has never made a
[45:32] mistake?
[45:34] And you know, it's a shame. The church
[45:36] beats each other up over mistakes.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; But by one man's disobedience, many were
[45:43] made sinners.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; By one man's obedience,
[45:46] &gt;&gt; bless the Lord,
[45:47] &gt;&gt; many are made righteous.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is not based on your
[45:51] past, your failures, your mistakes, all
[45:53] whatever you done. You've been called by
[45:55] God.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; You're a child of God. You sing a song.
[45:59] If you're a child of God, go home.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Talk to the Lord. take it to the Lord. I
[46:03] I even thought about the many things
[46:04] that brother Brandon went through. I
[46:06] mean, you talk about to bring this
[46:08] message to us.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; He was fought tooth and nail every kind
[46:12] of direction. This happened, this
[46:13] happened, different things happen. But
[46:14] when things happen, sometimes he would
[46:17] say, "God is leading me in a different
[46:19] direction."
[46:20] &gt;&gt; There's a reason for it
[46:21] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in Romans 8:28,
[46:23] "All things work together for good to
[46:26] them that love the Lord and are called
[46:28] according to his purpose." So when God
[46:31] calls you, I I thought about reigning in
[46:33] life, which is what I was kind of my
[46:34] subject. Let me see if I can get back in
[46:36] there. But when when you when God calls
[46:38] you, he wants you to be an overcomer.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; When God calls you, he wants you to be
[46:43] victorious. When God calls you, he has
[46:46] made a Have we got that still?
[46:48] &gt;&gt; When seeing
[46:50] to move to the next one, Okay. In
[46:53] Romans 5:12 it says, "Wherefore as by
[46:56] one man sin entered the world, and death
[46:58] by sin, and so death passed upon all
[47:00] men, for that all have sinned. For until
[47:04] the law, sin was in the world. But sin
[47:06] is not imputed when there's no law."
[47:09] Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to
[47:11] Moses, even over them that had not
[47:14] sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[47:16] transgression, who was a figure of him
[47:19] that was to come. So everybody's going
[47:21] to be born in sin, shape or neither come
[47:23] out speaking lies. And he said,
[47:25] "Nevertheless, death reigned over all of
[47:27] us."
[47:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the wages of sin is
[47:29] death, but the gift of God is eternal
[47:32] life through Jesus Christ.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Go next one, What's this?
[47:37] &gt;&gt; I got my little granddaughter left with
[47:38] us.
[47:40] But but not as the offense, so also it's
[47:44] a free gift.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; For through the offense of one, many be
[47:48] dead. Much more by the grace of God and
[47:50] the gift of righteousness which is one
[47:52] man Jesus Christ has abounded unto many.
[47:55] And not as it was by one that sinned, so
[47:58] is the gift. For the judgment was by one
[48:00] to condemnation, but the free gift is of
[48:03] many offenses to justification.
[48:06] For by one man's death, for by one man's
[48:10] offense death reigned by one, much more
[48:12] they which receive the abundance of
[48:14] grace and the gift of righteousness
[48:16] shall reign in life by one. Jesus
[48:18] Christ.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a smaller print. Therefore,
[48:25] by the offense of one, judgment came
[48:27] upon all men to condemnation, even so by
[48:29] the righteousness of one came the free
[48:31] gift to come of all me all men to the
[48:34] justification of life. I tried to make
[48:36] them bigger, but I didn't. For as by one
[48:38] man's disobedience, many were made
[48:40] sinners, so by the obedience of one man,
[48:43] who was that who was that one man?
[48:45] Jesus.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; See, you're your your your your ups and
[48:47] downs don't save it.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Your mistakes don't save you.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; We could beat ourselves up forever over,
[48:55] man. I've done this, done this, did did
[48:57] &gt;&gt; just repent.
[48:59] Get up and go.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Forget the past.
[49:06] Amen. Paul said, "Forgetting those
[49:08] things which are behind me,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; yes,
[49:10] &gt;&gt; reaching toward the things that are
[49:12] before me,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark of the prize of
[49:15] the high calling in Jesus Christ."
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; If we could we get a hold of that.
[49:21] Brother Bram said, Brother Bram said,
[49:22] "We need rapturing faith."
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And you said, "We hardly got faith for a
[49:26] headache."
[49:26] &gt;&gt; We say, "How are we going to get
[49:27] rapturing faith?"
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Well, it's going to take knowing who we
[49:30] are in Jesus Christ. It's going to take
[49:33] quit letting all the little uh things
[49:36] that come our way that brings her down.
[49:37] And you know, I respect Sister Jerene
[49:40] and brother Duran. He's going through
[49:41] some tough tough times, but that man's a
[49:43] soldier.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; I respect that.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; I respect brother Burrus and sister
[49:48] Burrus. We miss him
[49:50] &gt;&gt; and we don't understand the whole
[49:51] situation, but thank God for what
[49:53] they've done in their ministry and we'll
[49:55] see them on the other side. All these
[49:57] things don't mean anything. We have to
[49:58] overlook all the junk.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and look to the author and the
[50:03] finisher of our faith. Who for the joy
[50:05] that was set before him endured the
[50:08] cross despise the shame and is set on
[50:10] the right hand of power.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; God is still God and God is still in
[50:15] control.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And see where am I? Okay, next one
[50:25] please.
[50:27] Reign means to exercise sovereign
[50:30] authority.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Not our own authority or our own
[50:33] ability, but God's authority.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; See, we're weak. We're human beings, you
[50:38] know. We're just human beings.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; You know,
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was sold out to this
[50:45] gospel,
[50:46] &gt;&gt; called by God for that purpose,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; where would we be without if we were in
[50:52] a denominational church?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Sure. You you can't even preach unless
[50:56] you got a their ticket.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; You got to believe exactly what they
[51:00] tell you to preach. You think I'd have
[51:02] liberty to preach what I'm preaching
[51:03] here in any other church
[51:06] &gt;&gt; or run you out so fast.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear that
[51:10] &gt;&gt; because their system they license you
[51:13] and if you don't have their mark, you
[51:16] can't buy or sell.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; You have to you you got to have that
[51:20] Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal,
[51:21] Lutheran, whatever it is. You can't
[51:22] preach unless you agree to every little
[51:24] thing they tell you.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; But we ought to agree with the message.
[51:28] That's for sure.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And there's many interpretations of the
[51:31] message. We understand that, too. But
[51:33] put all that aside.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Because you know, Brother Bram said how
[51:36] that it wasn't a a miracle how Martin
[51:39] Luther was fought and and could rise up
[51:41] with the just live of faith,
[51:43] &gt;&gt; but it was all the fanatics that
[51:45] followed after.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; And the same thing with brother
[51:47] Brandon's ministry. all kinds of
[51:49] different I believe it this way, this
[51:51] way, this way, this way, this way. We
[51:53] believe it the Bible way.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandon take you back to
[51:56] the Bible.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; So all this other stuff, we shouldn't be
[51:59] divided amongst each other.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; And I don't even criticize if somebody
[52:03] believes that this way or whatever they
[52:05] want to believe that's between them and
[52:06] the Lord.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And each local church is sovereign. So
[52:09] you're not we don't we should never
[52:11] fight with each other. You know, I got
[52:13] friends that are Baptist. I got friends
[52:14] that are Methodists. I got friends that
[52:15] are Lutherans. I got friends that are
[52:16] Church of Christ. I got friends that are
[52:18] any kind of denomination. I respect the
[52:20] person that wants to serve God.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; If they don't see what I see, that's
[52:24] okay.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; If they're called to something, they'll
[52:28] see it.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And if they're not, they're not. And and
[52:31] who's to say who God is going to say is
[52:33] going to be at the public gates.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That is not our job.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Our job is to preach the gospel to every
[52:41] creature. He that believeth and is
[52:42] baptized shall be saved. He believeth
[52:43] not shall be damned, and these signs
[52:45] shall follow
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. them to believe.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; That's our job is to preach the word and
[52:51] whoever accepts it. Jesus said, "All
[52:54] that the father has given me will come
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and I will not lose one.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; I will raise them up again at the last
[53:02] day. God is in control."
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; But yet I've I've been fought as hard as
[53:07] anybody.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; I've been lied on. I've been cheated.
[53:11] I've been talked about, mistreated.
[53:14] Well, well, well. You remember Sister
[53:16] Sander? I don't know what you come to
[53:18] do.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you come to do. I come
[53:21] to clap my hands. I come say amen. I'll
[53:25] come to leave for joy. Can you leave for
[53:27] joy? Black sister used to go our church
[53:29] years ago. Man, you talk about fired up.
[53:32] Tears are flowing.
[53:34] We need a fashion sin killing, devil
[53:37] chasing, camp meeting.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[53:43] And I and I I understand too there's
[53:45] extremes in that. There's a lot to put
[53:47] on,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; but there's real.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, next one, please. is
[53:55] and now the this these two scriptures
[53:57] the Lord dealt with me several years ago
[53:59] on this but this scripture here the
[54:00] ministration of death in 2 Corinthians
[54:03] 3:7 says but if the ministration of
[54:04] death written engraved in stones was
[54:07] glorious so that the children of Israel
[54:09] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[54:11] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[54:14] which glory was done away next one says
[54:21] how shall not the ministration of the
[54:23] spirit be rather glorious. For if the
[54:25] ministration of condemnation be glory,
[54:28] much more does the ministration of
[54:29] righteousness, exceeding glory. So if
[54:32] you can be so condemned that you can't
[54:34] even hold your head up, if you can be so
[54:37] condemned that you just,
[54:40] you know, I see a lot of people and I've
[54:41] been to churches everywhere I go
[54:43] traveling. I go I find a church.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; And I see so many depressed people in
[54:48] church.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And they ain't getting encouraged.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They're just going through the
[54:52] motions. Oh my, I got to go to church.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; And they're fuzzy fighting and arguing
[54:57] and harling and sad and and how you
[55:00] doing? Oh, not too good, brother. Well,
[55:02] you just went to church and you're just
[55:04] as sad or maybe sadder than you was when
[55:07] you come come in the door. Ain't
[55:09] something's wrong.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible is life.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Eternal life.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; And if we we got to get a hold of the
[55:18] substance of it. And the Bible says, "My
[55:19] people perish for lack of knowledge, for
[55:22] lack of understanding."
[55:24] &gt;&gt; God is simplicity.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; So, uh, the glory that excelth in 2
[55:29] Corinthians 3:10 says, "For even that
[55:30] which was made glorious had no glory in
[55:33] this respect by reason of the glory that
[55:36] excelth, a greater glory.
[55:39] For if that which was done away was
[55:41] glorious, much more that which remainth
[55:44] is glorious. Seeing then that we have
[55:46] such hope, we use great plainness of
[55:50] speech.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; This just call it like it is. We're
[55:53] saved by the grace of God. By the mercy
[55:55] of God, he's called us. He said, "He
[55:57] which hath begun a good work in you will
[55:59] perform it."
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Till the day of Jesus Christ.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; We used to think it would perform it
[56:03] till the next revival.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; And then we have to go get another tank
[56:07] of gas.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Well, you do need to get a tank of gas
[56:09] once in a while. We do get down and out.
[56:11] We need a renewing. But that doesn't
[56:13] change your position in Christ.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; It just needs you out of gas. Time to go
[56:18] pray. Time to get a hold of God. Time to
[56:20] say, "Lord, encourage me." You know, I'm
[56:22] so I I've had time to pray and said,
[56:24] "Lord, I'm so discouraged.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Seem like I'm fought in every
[56:28] direction." Boy, I just And then the
[56:30] Lord comes through and man, I wake up
[56:31] and praise the Lord. I'm up here. I've
[56:34] been It's like I got a new tank of gas.
[56:35] I'm ready to roll.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; So, did I already read that one? Oh
[56:42] yeah, but and not as Moses which put a
[56:43] veil on his face, that the children of
[56:45] Israel could not steadfastly behold the
[56:46] end of that which is abolished.
[56:49] But their minds were blinded for until
[56:52] this day remainth the same veil and
[56:53] taken away and the reading of the Old
[56:55] Testament which fell is done away in
[56:57] Christ. The the Old Testament was the
[56:59] types and shadows of the New Testament
[57:02] and the law. The Bible says, "Wherefore
[57:04] then serveth the law, it was added
[57:06] because of transgression till the seed
[57:08] should come to whom the promise was made
[57:10] and it was ordained by angels in a
[57:12] mediator." And he said, "The mediator is
[57:14] not a mediator one, but God is one." So
[57:16] the law was our school master. It told
[57:19] us what was right and wrong. Thou shall
[57:20] not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou
[57:21] shall not commit adultery. Thou shalt
[57:23] not bear false witness. All these
[57:24] different things. The law brought us to
[57:27] the fact to recognize that we were a
[57:29] sinner.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; But it didn't condemn you. It wanted to
[57:32] make you know I'm a sinner. I need
[57:34] salvation.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Then when you get born again,
[57:38] born again, there's really been a change
[57:41] in me. Born again just like Jesus said.
[57:45] Born again and all because of Calvary.
[57:49] I'm glad. So glad that I've been born
[57:52] again.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I, you know, I drink
[57:56] all I want to. I smoke all I want to. I
[57:58] cuss all I want to. I don't want to.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[58:02] A new birth.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; A new birth.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; All right. See where I'm at here.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Already moved it one,
[58:15] Or did have I already read that one?
[58:17] Okay. Thank you. But their minds were
[58:20] blinded for until that day this day
[58:23] remained at the same veil and taken away
[58:25] in the reading of the Old Testament
[58:27] which veil is done away in Christ. A lot
[58:29] of people still they still try to live
[58:31] by the letter of the law to be saved. A
[58:34] lot of these old time holiness folks and
[58:37] I believe in the old time holiness but a
[58:39] lot of them trying to do it by the law.
[58:41] I I visited a little old outreach I've
[58:43] been visiting lately up in Bortlesville
[58:45] and the guy's got he believes that you
[58:47] can't show your elbows. He says, "Why
[58:50] you wear them short sleeve shirts?" I
[58:52] said, "Well, I ain't had nobody left
[58:53] that for my elbows."
[58:58] and he got this and he said, "Well, I I
[59:00] I couldn't do that. I got convictions."
[59:04] I said, "Well, where's that in the
[59:05] Bible?" You know, and bless his heart,
[59:07] he's a good person, you know, but then I
[59:10] go through the Bible studies and he have
[59:11] his sleeves. He got these short work
[59:13] shorts these shirts, but they go past
[59:14] his elbow.
[59:17] See, there's so much craziness
[59:20] &gt;&gt; that's been added to the word. And the
[59:22] Bible says, "Don't add to the Bible and
[59:23] don't take away from the Bible because
[59:25] the Bible is to give you life." Jesus
[59:28] said, "I come that you might have life
[59:30] and you might have life more
[59:31] abundantly."
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. So, and let's see where
[59:37] I'm at
[59:39] said in 2 Corinthians 3:15, "But even
[59:41] until this day, when Moses is read, the
[59:43] veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless,
[59:45] it shall be taken away. The veil when it
[59:47] is turned to the Lord, the veil shall be
[59:49] taken away.
[59:51] Now, the Lord is that spirit. And where
[59:53] the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[59:55] liberty.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Where's liberty? Y'all y'all got it
[59:59] here. I ain't talking necessarily to
[1:00:01] all, but I believe we all we all need
[1:00:03] refreshing.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; I I I mean, I tell you, the Martin
[1:00:06] family is on fire for God. There ain't
[1:00:10] no
[1:00:12] I They do more than I could ever dream
[1:00:14] of. I don't have I don't have the gifts
[1:00:16] y'all got. I'm just I'm just doortodoor
[1:00:19] and street preacher and outreach and
[1:00:23] jail ministry and you know that's what
[1:00:25] I've always done. I thought I was going
[1:00:27] to try to be a pastor and I learned I
[1:00:28] wasn't called to be that. I don't I
[1:00:30] don't have the patience. Brother Window
[1:00:33] and I don't have the ability. So I'm
[1:00:34] just an outreach and that's all I like
[1:00:36] to do. I witness to people everywhere. I
[1:00:38] went to in the store. I 72 still working
[1:00:40] full-time because we're supporting
[1:00:41] grandkids and I I witness the people in
[1:00:44] there.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of them like it, some of them
[1:00:46] don't. But I don't use I use wisdom. I
[1:00:49] don't just do it. But if I see somebody
[1:00:50] and talk about them, I explain a few
[1:00:52] things to them
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; and uh just plant some seed. You know,
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; one plants, one waters, God gives
[1:00:58] increase.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "Now the Lord
[1:01:02] is that spirit, and where the spirit of
[1:01:04] the Lord is, there's liberty. But we all
[1:01:06] with open face see we should we don't
[1:01:08] have to be ashamed beholding in the
[1:01:10] glass the glory of the Lord or change
[1:01:13] into the same im image from glory to
[1:01:15] glory even as by the spirit of the Lord.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; The law does not save us. It only makes
[1:01:22] us aware that we are sinners in need of
[1:01:24] salvation. It identified sin so we could
[1:01:26] know that we need a savior.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose.
[1:01:30] Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are
[1:01:33] you saved through faith, and that not of
[1:01:34] yourselves, is a gift of God, not of
[1:01:37] works, lest any man should boast. For we
[1:01:40] are his workmanship, created in Christ
[1:01:42] Jesus under good works, which God has
[1:01:44] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:01:47] them." Our works don't save us. Bible
[1:01:49] says, "Our righteousness is filthy
[1:01:50] rags."
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; But we do want to live a life that's
[1:01:53] pleasing unto God. when I was working a
[1:01:55] in a grocery store in in O was Oklahoma.
[1:01:59] Of course, I used to I just got saved
[1:02:01] 1976 and and boy, I was on fire. You
[1:02:04] know, I just I'd be witnessing to the to
[1:02:06] the Coke man, the deliver man, and the
[1:02:08] bread man, and I'd talk to him about God
[1:02:10] putting his family back together, and I
[1:02:12] I'd be witnessing to everybody, and in
[1:02:14] this in the deal, I'd go. But anyway,
[1:02:16] this one manager, uh, he he hated my
[1:02:19] guts and he used to pick on me all the
[1:02:21] time. I was I was doing the dirty and
[1:02:23] frozen food and he would he would call
[1:02:25] me. He would just pick on me and call me
[1:02:26] to go take out grocery, do this, do
[1:02:28] that. Well, if the milk was empty, I'm
[1:02:30] going to fill the milk up and then I'll
[1:02:31] be back up there.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; I just said, "No, I've got to make sure
[1:02:34] there's milk cuz everybody needs some
[1:02:36] milk and I'm the milk man. So, I fill
[1:02:38] the milk up and then I'll be up there."
[1:02:39] Well, he got mad at me one day and uh he
[1:02:41] he called me and then here a few days
[1:02:44] later, the Lord's been dealing with it.
[1:02:45] So, he I was go walking through the back
[1:02:47] room. He picked me up by the shirt, put
[1:02:49] me up against the wall. He goes, "Do you
[1:02:51] think I'm going to hell? Do you think
[1:02:53] I'm going to hell?" I say, "Are you
[1:02:56] saved?"
[1:02:57] He said,
[1:02:59] he put put me there.
[1:03:02] He got saved a few few months later, I
[1:03:04] found out, you know. And then I had
[1:03:06] another grocery store I worked at in
[1:03:07] Claremore and there was a manager there
[1:03:10] and he was filthy, put it that way. And
[1:03:14] he used and pardon me I don't want to
[1:03:16] say much but he used to put like
[1:03:19] inappropriate pictures in front of the
[1:03:20] the girls that worked in the office on
[1:03:22] the deal. I went back in the back at one
[1:03:25] time and and uh see they were crying
[1:03:27] back there the people were in the office
[1:03:29] and I told him I said what's the matter
[1:03:30] and they told me what was going on. So I
[1:03:32] went up to him I said look I said them
[1:03:35] girls don't appreciate you doing that
[1:03:37] putting that filthiness in their face
[1:03:38] when they go clock in and out. I'm just
[1:03:40] I'm just a little old checker. Yeah.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; He goes, "Who told you that?" I said, "I
[1:03:47] ain't telling you."
[1:03:49] So, oh, he was mad. I would I never
[1:03:51] would tell. I never have told him to
[1:03:52] this day. And I said, "I ain't telling
[1:03:54] telling you." I didn't want to get them
[1:03:55] in trouble. So, anyway, one day he walks
[1:03:58] in the store. He's little bitty short
[1:03:59] guy. We called him squatty.
[1:04:03] But he come walking in the door and he
[1:04:06] look
[1:04:07] I was the only checker up front. He
[1:04:09] goes, "You clock out. You're fired.
[1:04:11] You're out of here." All right, goodbye.
[1:04:14] So, I wrote to the corporate office and
[1:04:16] I just let him know kind of the
[1:04:18] situation that happened there and they
[1:04:20] fired him later on you. So anyway, the
[1:04:23] the whole situation went on and then it
[1:04:26] was about maybe a year or so later I
[1:04:28] went to work at that super rich in Aaso
[1:04:30] and he ended up well first of all we
[1:04:32] owned a little grocery store in
[1:04:33] Katonville and we bought that that was a
[1:04:34] miracle that God did that's where I got
[1:04:36] saved but anyway when that all went
[1:04:38] south and I went to work in OASO in
[1:04:40] Super H and uh so anyway when I walked
[1:04:43] in the door to get a job the manager was
[1:04:46] standing there and that little guy was
[1:04:48] there and of course the Lord had already
[1:04:50] dealt with him. He said he's a good boy.
[1:04:52] Hire him. I there like three three
[1:04:55] years. See, and he got saved.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So, see, God can work.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And and God does the miracles.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And but he got saved and you for lost
[1:05:04] parts. I know he's been saved since, but
[1:05:07] you know, God God does the work.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; One planteth, one watth, God gives the
[1:05:13] increase. And I go on and on about
[1:05:14] different things like that. But God is
[1:05:16] still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:05:18] forever.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Let's see.
[1:05:21] In Psalms 103:11 says, "For as the
[1:05:23] heaven is high above the earth, so great
[1:05:26] is his mercy toward them that fear him.
[1:05:29] As far as the east is from the west, so
[1:05:32] far hath he removed our transgression
[1:05:34] from us."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Like a father pityth his children, so
[1:05:39] God pityth them that fear him. For he
[1:05:41] knoweth our frame, and rememberth we are
[1:05:44] dust.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; We're human beings,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; you know. Now, this is kind of weird,
[1:05:51] but the Bible says Jesus, our Lord
[1:05:53] Jesus, which was God and manifest in
[1:05:54] human flesh. The Bible says he was
[1:05:56] tempted in all points
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; as we are.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about that on the way
[1:06:01] down here. I said, "So maybe lust,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; all points."
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Now, that's that sounds kind of crude,
[1:06:08] but what I'm saying is he knew the
[1:06:10] battles we fight.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; You know, a man's a man, a woman's a
[1:06:14] woman, and people's people. But you got
[1:06:16] to overcome those fears. You know, me
[1:06:18] and my wife's been married 52 years,
[1:06:21] going on 53 years now. And uh you know,
[1:06:24] God's changed her changed her, saved
[1:06:25] her. You know, fact, we was in Walmart
[1:06:28] yesterday getting groceries. This lady
[1:06:30] go always commenting on, "Well, I love
[1:06:32] that beautiful long hair of my wife and
[1:06:34] and uh she was I I like to kid with
[1:06:36] people." So, she was walking past it was
[1:06:39] yesterday and said, "Oh, that she this
[1:06:41] lady, she goes, "Oh, your wife's got the
[1:06:43] most beautiful long hair." I said, "I
[1:06:44] used to have in the 70s."
[1:06:48] So, she just laughed.
[1:06:51] But long hair don't save you, but long
[1:06:54] hair is God made men and God made women.
[1:06:57] And the Bible says, "Does not nature
[1:06:59] itself teach you that if a man have long
[1:07:00] hair is a shame, but a woman's hair is
[1:07:02] given for a covering?" You don't have to
[1:07:04] beat up people with it. Nobody had to
[1:07:06] tell me when God dealt with me and I I
[1:07:08] started cutting hair.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Now, it's starting to fall out.
[1:07:14] Amen. Praise the Lord. I got a ball spot
[1:07:17] back here. My wife said, but I don't
[1:07:19] worry about that. So,
[1:07:21] I'm I'm 100 going on 90. So, see where
[1:07:25] else? Go ahead. He says death reigns as
[1:07:29] a result. When you think of death
[1:07:31] raining in our life, we got sickness, we
[1:07:34] got heartache and troubles, trying to
[1:07:36] pay the bills, all kinds of stuff we got
[1:07:38] to deal with, trying to work for people.
[1:07:39] I mean everything we do spiritual
[1:07:41] battles by the fall of one man
[1:07:44] uh we inherit that fall in sin shape
[1:07:47] iniquity come speaking lies the fall of
[1:07:49] Adam has if if the fall of Adam has that
[1:07:52] much power how much more the blood of
[1:07:54] the Lord Jesus
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; you think all the stuff that we go
[1:07:58] through the Lord gave me this message
[1:08:00] several years ago and I've been
[1:08:01] preaching for a long time but I just
[1:08:02] learned to use PowerPoint a few years
[1:08:04] back because when I got in the corporate
[1:08:05] office and I'll tell you about that in a
[1:08:07] minute but uh it says heaven shall pass.
[1:08:10] My word or not pass. But how I got into
[1:08:12] learning how to do all this stuff
[1:08:13] because I moved on my own at 16 years
[1:08:14] old. I rent the sleeping room at $9.25 a
[1:08:18] week. Burn it. And then we when my wife
[1:08:20] got married, she come into the
[1:08:22] convenience store. I worked at in in
[1:08:23] Claremore.
[1:08:25] Yeah. No, Tulsa. I worked at a
[1:08:27] convenience store in Clmore because long
[1:08:29] skinny guy. That's before I got saved.
[1:08:30] I'm kind of going back and forth. And uh
[1:08:32] so she come in and she winked. I winked
[1:08:35] her back at her.
[1:08:39] So finally I had the nerve to ask her to
[1:08:42] see about maybe going for a date and uh
[1:08:46] I fig how I'm trying to think how it all
[1:08:48] started but anyway that was the wink and
[1:08:50] then I thought well I kind of like her
[1:08:52] you know she kept coming and the good
[1:08:53] thing is her dad loved milk so he come
[1:08:56] he said come in every other day he bring
[1:08:58] milk well she seen how skinny I was so
[1:09:00] she was bringing me dinner you know she
[1:09:02] going to try to fatt me up a little bit
[1:09:04] because I was 118 pounds and 5' 11 And
[1:09:07] so she seen me sit like that and she
[1:09:09] kind of felt sorry for him I think you
[1:09:10] know but but anyway that's how we got
[1:09:12] started and then she had an ex-boyfriend
[1:09:16] and he's a big boy and I wasn't really
[1:09:18] planning on necessarily going to date
[1:09:20] her or nothing like that. I just liked
[1:09:22] her and I didn't know where it was going
[1:09:23] to go to and I was kind of shy and I
[1:09:24] thought I'm a skinny old runt. She ain't
[1:09:26] going to want me anyhow. So I kind of
[1:09:28] just thought about it but all of a
[1:09:30] sudden this big old boy comes in there.
[1:09:31] He goes are you going over Susan's?
[1:09:34] And I wasn't going there. I said as soon
[1:09:36] as I got to work, he said, "Well, you
[1:09:39] do. I'll meet you there." I went and he
[1:09:41] didn't show up.
[1:09:44] Now, he caught he probably could have
[1:09:45] tore me up, but don't tell me not to do
[1:09:48] it.
[1:09:50] I'll get my little skinny army.
[1:09:53] And that's how we got together. So, but
[1:09:56] the Lord ordained it, you know, and then
[1:09:58] my wife got saved later. So, you know,
[1:09:59] God God has our our plan, our life. He's
[1:10:02] got it in his hands.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the things that we go,
[1:10:05] whatever we go through, the Bible says,
[1:10:06] "Even the Lord Jesus, though he were a
[1:10:08] son, he learned obedience by the things
[1:10:11] he suffered." See, I should be closing
[1:10:13] pretty soon here. I don't want to wear
[1:10:15] you all out there. Uh 1 Corinthians
[1:10:18] 15:45, "And so it is written, the first
[1:10:21] man, Adam, was made a living soul. The
[1:10:23] last Adam was made a quickening spirit,
[1:10:26] bringing life." How about that which not
[1:10:29] was not first which is spiritual, but
[1:10:31] that which is natural, and after that
[1:10:33] which is spiritual. We're born
[1:10:35] naturally, and then we're born again
[1:10:37] spiritually.
[1:10:39] The first man of the earth is earthly.
[1:10:41] The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[1:10:44] And as the earth is, such are they also
[1:10:46] earthly. And as the heavenly, such are
[1:10:48] they also that are heavenly. And this is
[1:10:51] my favorite part here. The Lord just
[1:10:53] showed me this years ago. And as we have
[1:10:55] borne the image of the earthy, we shall
[1:10:58] also bear the image of the heavenly.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; It's a natural process.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I got this face. I got this what who I
[1:11:06] am.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; All I did is ate groceries.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; See, and you ate the word of God and you
[1:11:12] feed on the word of God. And as you feed
[1:11:14] on the word of God, forsake not the
[1:11:16] assembling of ourselves together, but
[1:11:17] the banner of sun mid, but exhorting one
[1:11:19] another. And even though it's more as we
[1:11:21] see the day approaching. Now, I know
[1:11:25] that y'all ain't going to miss no
[1:11:26] natural meals.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Oh man, we hungry. We're going to eat
[1:11:30] cheeseburger. We're going to eat
[1:11:31] whatever we're going to eat. We're going
[1:11:32] to eat something. So, the spiritual
[1:11:35] man's hungry, too.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible says,
[1:11:38] "Forsaking not as simply of yourselves
[1:11:40] together as a matter of some minutes,
[1:11:41] but exhorting one another and even more
[1:11:43] as you see the day approaching." Yeah.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; So, that's the importance of church
[1:11:47] attendance and worshiping God and being
[1:11:49] together and having a good church that's
[1:11:51] actually preaching the word of God and
[1:11:53] not just having garage sales and soup
[1:11:55] slippers and all kinds of things to
[1:11:57] raise money for this and raise money for
[1:11:58] that and we're going to go to youth
[1:11:59] camp. We're going all kinds of stuff.
[1:12:01] And nothing against youth camp if it's
[1:12:02] right,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; but there's a lot of that stuff. It's
[1:12:04] just money making gimmicks. I've seen
[1:12:06] everything out there. It's crazy.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Uh, now this I say, brethren, that flesh
[1:12:12] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[1:12:13] God. Neither does corruption inherit
[1:12:15] incorruption. We shall not all sleep,
[1:12:18] but we shall all be changed. How many
[1:12:20] know we're looking forward to a body
[1:12:22] change?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[1:12:27] at the last trump, for the trumpet shall
[1:12:29] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[1:12:30] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[1:12:33] For this corruption, corrup
[1:12:36] in incorruption, and this mortal must
[1:12:39] put on immortality.
[1:12:42] So when this corruptible that's put on
[1:12:44] incorruptible, this mortal shall have
[1:12:46] put on immortalized, then shall be
[1:12:48] brought to pass that saying that is
[1:12:50] written, death is swallowed up in
[1:12:52] victory. Oh death, where is thy sting?
[1:12:54] Oh grave, where is thy victory? The
[1:12:57] sting of death is sin, and the strength
[1:13:00] of sin is the law. But thanks to God,
[1:13:03] which give us the victory through our
[1:13:05] Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my
[1:13:07] beloved, be you steadfast, unmovable,
[1:13:10] always abounding in the work of the
[1:13:12] Lord. For as much as you know that your
[1:13:14] labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Now, before I get into this one here,
[1:13:21] how many knows that our labor or the
[1:13:25] things we do, we know that one day, the
[1:13:27] Bible says the last enemy to be
[1:13:29] destroyed is death.
[1:13:32] I'm 72 going on 100. So, the last enemy
[1:13:35] we destroyed, I always tell people I'm
[1:13:37] 100, but I don't feel a day over 90. You
[1:13:39] know, I just play around with them. But
[1:13:41] I said, well, I'm 72, Grandma's 67, I
[1:13:45] think. Going to be 68 pretty quick.
[1:13:47] Still going strong. So, but how many
[1:13:51] knows uh
[1:13:53] God is in control?
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And so, we're getting closer to the
[1:13:57] finish line.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And it could be the rapture coming
[1:13:59] anytime. We don't know when it'll be,
[1:14:00] but we know that when it does happen, we
[1:14:02] just need to be be ready. Excuse me.
[1:14:05] Now, I want to point out a few things
[1:14:07] here. Abraham under was under grace
[1:14:10] before the law because God called
[1:14:12] Abraham. God didn't say, "If you do
[1:14:13] this, this is this." God said,"Abraham,
[1:14:16] get out from among your country, your
[1:14:17] kindred to a land that I'll show you,
[1:14:19] and I will make you a father of many
[1:14:21] nations."
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; There was no law then.
[1:14:25] Moses was during law under law and the
[1:14:28] ten commandments. That was his purpose
[1:14:30] to bring the law. And the Bible says,
[1:14:32] "Wherefore then servants of law, it was
[1:14:34] our school master to bring us to
[1:14:36] Christ." It showed us what right and
[1:14:38] wrong was. If you go driving down the
[1:14:40] street and there ain't no stop sign, how
[1:14:42] do you know you doing anything wrong?
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; the law was our school master to bring
[1:14:48] us to Christ. It shows us what's right,
[1:14:49] what's wrong, what you should do, what
[1:14:50] you shouldn't do. That's the purpose of
[1:14:52] the law. It ain't to condemn you, to
[1:14:54] destroy you. It just to let you know
[1:14:55] this is wrong and this is right.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't Adam and Eve. It I mean,
[1:15:01] it wasn't Adam and Steve. It was Adam
[1:15:02] and Eve. So, I just threw that extra.
[1:15:05] But, uh,
[1:15:07] so the law and grace and grace came by
[1:15:09] the Lord Jesus Christ. Go next one. Now,
[1:15:12] to and this is a scripture again that
[1:15:14] brother John David and them gave me and
[1:15:16] and got me saved or the Lord did. Romans
[1:15:18] 9 1-24.
[1:15:20] It's not him that willth, nor him that
[1:15:22] runth, but God that shows mercy. So
[1:15:25] there's a ministration of condemnation
[1:15:28] that brings condemnation. The devil
[1:15:29] wants to condemn you.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to beat you down. The
[1:15:33] devil want he he don't want you out
[1:15:34] witnessing and out you reaching souls
[1:15:36] and out working for him.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; So he wants to keep you down as much as
[1:15:40] he can keep you down.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; But God wants you to get up and rise
[1:15:43] above all that to where we can go out
[1:15:44] and win other people to the Lord.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. You know, the harvest is
[1:15:48] plentous and the labor is few.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And the reason why because the devil
[1:15:52] wants to beat us down. Say we're not
[1:15:54] worthy.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Well, find where God tells you to be and
[1:15:58] and get into it.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; So, let's see. Romans 9:1 is that's the
[1:16:04] next.
[1:16:07] I say the truth in Christ. I lie not. my
[1:16:10] my conscience also bearing my witness in
[1:16:12] the Holy Ghost that I have great
[1:16:14] heaviness and continual sorrow in my
[1:16:16] heart. This is Paul writing for I could
[1:16:20] wish that myself were cursed from Christ
[1:16:22] for my brethren and my kinsmen according
[1:16:24] to the flesh. He's talking about the
[1:16:25] Jews who were blinded for our sakes. A
[1:16:29] lot of people don't understand the Jews
[1:16:30] were blinded so we could have salvation.
[1:16:32] We'll have a rapture and then God has a
[1:16:33] plan. Brother Brandon explained it
[1:16:35] exactly what's taking place.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; A lot of people they fight me. They say
[1:16:40] they say that there is no salvation for
[1:16:42] the Jews. This is they're not they
[1:16:44] messed up. Their time's over.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That is totally false.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; God says that they will be a remnant
[1:16:50] saved for the Jews and all the all the
[1:16:52] fathers give me Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
[1:16:54] Joseph, Israel, all the way through
[1:16:56] that. God has a Jewish remnant that'll
[1:16:58] be saved during the tribulation.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; So, but we're gonna be raptured out
[1:17:02] before that.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; And that couldn't be too far off the way
[1:17:05] the devil's fighting.
[1:17:07] See, Paul said, "I wish myself," verse
[1:17:09] three, "would be a curse for my kinsmen
[1:17:11] according to the flesh,
[1:17:13] who are Israelites, of who predated
[1:17:15] adoption and glory and the covenants and
[1:17:17] the giving of the law and the service of
[1:17:19] God and the promise, whose are the
[1:17:21] fathers and from whom concerning the
[1:17:23] flesh Christ came, who overall God
[1:17:25] blessed forever." Amen.
[1:17:28] Not as though the word of God has taken
[1:17:29] none effect. For they are not all Israel
[1:17:32] which are of Israel. Neither because
[1:17:34] they are the seed of Abraham are they
[1:17:36] all children. But in Isaac shall thy
[1:17:38] seed be called. That is they which are
[1:17:40] the children of the flesh. These are not
[1:17:42] the children of God. But the children of
[1:17:44] God are promised or counted for the
[1:17:46] seed. For this is the word of promise at
[1:17:48] this time will I come and Sarah shall
[1:17:51] have a son. And not only this, but when
[1:17:54] Rebecca also had conceived, even by our
[1:17:56] father Isaac, for the This is the
[1:17:58] scripture got me in here. For the
[1:18:01] children being not yet born, neither
[1:18:03] having done any good or evil, that the
[1:18:05] perfect of God according to election
[1:18:07] might stand, not of works, but him that
[1:18:09] callst. The elder shall serve the
[1:18:11] younger. Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[1:18:14] have I hated.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; How many knows there was two seeds in
[1:18:17] the garden, Cain and Abel, Isaac and
[1:18:19] Ishmael, Jacob and Esau. All through the
[1:18:21] Bible, you have the the the true and the
[1:18:22] false. True and the false, true and the
[1:18:24] false. It's also and that's why you got
[1:18:27] people that are wicked. So I absolutely
[1:18:29] believe serpent seed. There is serpent
[1:18:31] seed.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; You won't reach the serpent seat. But if
[1:18:34] you can reach out, you will reach a
[1:18:36] child of God who has something in their
[1:18:38] heart that can change. And you can't
[1:18:39] judge who's who.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; You don't know who's going to be who.
[1:18:42] You'll be a surprise. Some of the people
[1:18:44] get saved that was on it looked like
[1:18:47] they were bad seed, but they got mixed
[1:18:48] up in the wrong crowd. So we can't judge
[1:18:51] that either. We just preach the gospel
[1:18:52] to every creature.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And he that believeth and is baptized
[1:18:55] shall be saved.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; So he said, uh, what shall we say then?
[1:18:59] Is there an righteousness of God? God
[1:19:01] forbid. For he said to Moses, I will
[1:19:04] have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
[1:19:08] and I will have compassion on whom I
[1:19:10] will comp have compassion. So it's not
[1:19:12] of him that willth, nor of him that
[1:19:14] runth, but God that shows mercy.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy. For the
[1:19:19] scripture said unto Pharaoh, now notice
[1:19:21] Pharaoh was raised for a purpose.
[1:19:23] Brother Brandon explained all these
[1:19:24] things to us in such a I mean you thank
[1:19:27] God for the message that a prophet of
[1:19:29] God appointed all we we wouldn't see
[1:19:31] this without a prophet of God.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; I ain't smart enough. None of us smart
[1:19:34] enough. God always has a major prophet.
[1:19:36] Amos Amos 3:7. Surely the go Lord God
[1:19:39] did nothing but he first reveal a secret
[1:19:41] to his servants of prophets.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And people fight a prophet. They don't
[1:19:44] they don't the reason they fight it.
[1:19:46] They don't want to know what he said.
[1:19:48] They don't want to have to adhere to it.
[1:19:50] But a seed of God will say, "Amen."
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "For the scripture,
[1:19:55] and that my name might be declared to
[1:19:56] all the of the earth. Therefore has he
[1:20:00] mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
[1:20:02] whom he will, he hardens?"
[1:20:05] I will say then, why does he yet have
[1:20:06] thought? For who hath resisted his will?
[1:20:08] But oh man, who art thou that replies
[1:20:11] against God? Shall the thing form say to
[1:20:12] him that formeth, "Why have you made me
[1:20:14] thus?"
[1:20:15] I said, "Lord, why'd you make me like
[1:20:17] this here? Why did you make me 5'11 and
[1:20:19] skinny and I didn't get no muscles?
[1:20:22] He made me He made me be what I am.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; I can run the cash register.
[1:20:27] I can I'm a salesman. I was a salesman
[1:20:29] as a little boy. I I sold when I was a
[1:20:32] young boy, I sold donuts door to door
[1:20:34] and then I sold uh Christmas cards. We
[1:20:37] lived in New Mexico. My stepdad was in
[1:20:39] the Air Force. I never knew my real dad,
[1:20:40] but but my my
[1:20:43] in the Air Force. So, but anyway, I'd go
[1:20:45] when I was in New Mexico, I just kind of
[1:20:46] going back and forth a little bit, but I
[1:20:48] remember I wanted to sell Christmas
[1:20:50] cards, but I wanted to go to the Mexican
[1:20:51] side of town because my my mama was
[1:20:53] Mexican and I'm half Mexican. And so, I
[1:20:55] wanted to go to the Mexican side. So, I
[1:20:57] asked the teacher, I said, "Could you
[1:20:58] teach me how to say you want to buy
[1:21:00] Christmas cards in Spanish because I'm
[1:21:01] going to go across the tracks and I'm
[1:21:02] going to sell Christmas cards." And you
[1:21:04] order them from a deal, you know. So, he
[1:21:06] taught me for two or three weeks. Then I
[1:21:08] finally learned
[1:21:12] and I learned it and I picked I picked
[1:21:14] it up while I was ready to roll. I took
[1:21:16] my little book down there and first
[1:21:18] house I went to I knocked on the door
[1:21:20] little Mexican woman come out. I go get
[1:21:21] confir
[1:21:24] today son.
[1:21:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:34] But anyway, I don't did that and then I
[1:21:35] sold uh I remember when I was young in
[1:21:37] Tennessee when we move my stepdad was in
[1:21:39] the air force so we moved a lot. I was
[1:21:41] in Tennessee and I I was a long hair
[1:21:42] dippy. I have my beads on, have my peace
[1:21:44] sign, all that stuff. I'd walk
[1:21:45] everywhere and and that's when I kind of
[1:21:48] leaned toward Pentecost. I was trying to
[1:21:49] find out. So I went to this Pentecost
[1:21:51] revival and uh and I it was like a tent
[1:21:54] thing they had going and I went in there
[1:21:56] and sat on the back row. It was out in
[1:21:58] the open and the preacher come up to me
[1:22:00] says, "Can I help you young man?" I
[1:22:02] said, 'Well, I wanted to come to your
[1:22:03] revival and kind of check things out.
[1:22:05] See what's going on. He go, I'll tell
[1:22:06] you something, young man. He said, 'Go
[1:22:08] get yourself a haircut and get some
[1:22:09] decent clothes on. This is the house of
[1:22:11] God. You just get on out of here and
[1:22:12] come back later. So, I never to go back.
[1:22:15] So,
[1:22:17] see, God God was dealing with me. But
[1:22:19] some of these so-called preachers, man,
[1:22:20] they don't have a clue. The Bible says
[1:22:22] many false prophets shall arise and
[1:22:24] deceive many. But thank God that one day
[1:22:27] the eagles cry. Amen. They say, "Oh man,
[1:22:30] who art thou that replies against God?
[1:22:32] Shall the thing for form said to him
[1:22:33] that formed it, why hast thou made me
[1:22:35] thus? Hath not the potter of power over
[1:22:37] the clay of the same lump to make one
[1:22:38] vessel under honor and another under
[1:22:40] dishonor?" So we know there going to be
[1:22:42] both of those. What if God willing to
[1:22:45] show his wrath and to make his power
[1:22:46] known endured with much long suffering
[1:22:48] the vessels of wrath fitted to
[1:22:50] destruction that he might make known the
[1:22:52] riches of his glory on the vessels of
[1:22:53] mercy which he had afford prepared to
[1:22:55] glory? He had afford prepared
[1:22:58] even us whom he has called. Not of the
[1:22:59] Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.
[1:23:03] Believe it or not, I only had 38 slides,
[1:23:04] but and then this should be the last
[1:23:06] one. Galatians 4:19. My little children
[1:23:09] of whom I travail in birth until Christ
[1:23:12] be formed in you. Is that it? This Oh,
[1:23:16] two more. Okay. I hope I ain't boring
[1:23:18] y'all too much.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; As a born again Christian, we are we we
[1:23:23] attend church. I mean, you know what? If
[1:23:26] I don't go to the gas station to get
[1:23:28] gas, I had to get gas before I come down
[1:23:29] here.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; I had to keep an eye on my gas level.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And if I didn't put it in there, in
[1:23:36] fact, we went to Texas here recently
[1:23:40] last weekend. I hadn't been on the road
[1:23:42] in so long. I hadn't drove because and I
[1:23:44] don't see that good at night. So, I
[1:23:46] don't drive at night hard anymore. And
[1:23:48] uh I'm not quite to the nursing home
[1:23:49] age, but I'm, you know, I get to I got
[1:23:51] issues. So, but anyway, my aunt talked
[1:23:54] us into driving down there. And so, I
[1:23:56] drove down there and I' been it been
[1:23:59] like six years since I've been out of
[1:24:00] Barsville pretty much. I mean, just a
[1:24:02] little here and there, maybe aua, but I
[1:24:04] was kind of nervous, but my aunt said,
[1:24:06] "Come on." And we wanted to see little
[1:24:07] Joanna and we want to meet and all that.
[1:24:09] So, I said, "Okay, we're going to go."
[1:24:11] So, we we left. I got off work at Fry
[1:24:13] and we drove that evening and got all
[1:24:14] the way down. And I was getting lost.
[1:24:17] All the roads is all different. I ain't
[1:24:18] never I ain't even been to Tulsa in so
[1:24:20] long. I was trying to figure out all
[1:24:21] these robes and I had all this
[1:24:22] construction going like that and I was
[1:24:24] like nervous. I didn't want to let my
[1:24:26] wife know because I'm driving, you know,
[1:24:27] but I was going I was like scared. Oh
[1:24:29] boy, I got to turn this way this and
[1:24:31] here's the car. I can't see that way.
[1:24:33] And I finally get through that big old
[1:24:34] mess. And we got down to the Indian
[1:24:36] Nation turnpike back in the day when I
[1:24:38] used to travel all the time. I'd go
[1:24:39] everywhere. And the thing is they had a
[1:24:41] little towate you pull off. So what did
[1:24:43] I do? I get on the Indian Nation
[1:24:45] turnpike and I pull off at the first
[1:24:47] exit thinking I'm going to a toe gate.
[1:24:48] What did I get off at and exit? So, I
[1:24:51] had to go 10 miles, come all the way
[1:24:53] back and then get back on it again. I
[1:24:56] was looking for a toll gate. That but
[1:24:57] that's history. We don't have that no
[1:24:59] more. But anyway, I drove I drove down
[1:25:01] there. You know, things change. But but
[1:25:03] that got me a little bit more getting
[1:25:04] back out again because we've been kind
[1:25:06] of secluded where we're we're at there.
[1:25:08] And so last time I come here, I got
[1:25:10] lost. You remember?
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; My little granddaughter says, "Grandpa,
[1:25:12] don't you get lost again." She told me
[1:25:14] she was going to come, but you I
[1:25:16] thought, well, I have a hard time
[1:25:17] keeping up with her. And of course,
[1:25:19] grandma's got stuff she got to do and
[1:25:20] stuff. And and I thought, well, I'll
[1:25:22] just come down myself. But I said,
[1:25:24] "Grandpa, don't you get lost." But
[1:25:25] anyway, I came up today and of course I
[1:25:28] just flowed. And then, of course, 18. I
[1:25:32] had my little thing on my card that
[1:25:33] tells me this, that, and the other, and
[1:25:35] I got right here.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; It was smooth. So, thank the Lord for
[1:25:39] that. Uh, one more. I think there's one
[1:25:42] more in this
[1:25:43] keys to victory. We must have a solid
[1:25:45] foundation to build our Christian walk
[1:25:46] on the pure word of God. And thank God
[1:25:49] for a prophet because everybody thinks
[1:25:50] they got the pure word. The church of
[1:25:51] Christ thinks they got it. The Baptist
[1:25:52] think they got the Methodist think got
[1:25:54] all of them think they got it. God has
[1:25:57] it. And and again, I think we should
[1:26:00] respect every Christian. Whatever brain
[1:26:02] they are, we don't worry about no
[1:26:03] brains. In fact, when I when I I had
[1:26:06] took off over my grandpa's church for
[1:26:08] about three years here while a few years
[1:26:10] ago, I forget how long it was. I was
[1:26:12] going to be the pastor. Well, my grandpa
[1:26:15] and grandma was oldfashioned Methodist
[1:26:16] and my my uh my grandma's hair down to
[1:26:19] the floor. She wrote a bun and had all
[1:26:21] they're good solid Methodists, you know,
[1:26:24] and so when I got down there, I told
[1:26:26] told them I said, "I helped you get to
[1:26:27] church." And we wrote to the Methodist
[1:26:29] church and I'm grandpa's grandson and
[1:26:30] see Morales and we went through all that
[1:26:33] and and after three years, they give us
[1:26:35] the building and everything. Well, my
[1:26:36] cousins and all them come to me later.
[1:26:38] was they used to always when church was
[1:26:41] over they go hey how many's going to the
[1:26:43] casino today
[1:26:46] I woo so I said man this ain't no good
[1:26:50] so I I was trying to teach them all of
[1:26:51] it well they didn't like it but yet they
[1:26:53] knew we was in the process of getting to
[1:26:55] church so they let they let it happen at
[1:26:57] I'm not being recorded them
[1:27:01] it's okay I've already told them anyway
[1:27:03] but I but but I said uh I said uh you
[1:27:08] Well, my aunt claimed to be be a woman
[1:27:10] preacher and they waited till we got the
[1:27:13] church officially and it was signed over
[1:27:14] to us. And so I thought, well, getting
[1:27:17] ready to get things moving, you very
[1:27:20] next day after we got it official, one
[1:27:22] of my aunts who calls herself a win
[1:27:24] preacher, she says, uh, David says, we
[1:27:26] sure do love you and appreciate getting
[1:27:28] this church here. Uh, but we we want to
[1:27:31] we had a meeting last night and we
[1:27:32] discussed it and we really want you to
[1:27:35] just quit preaching on casinos and
[1:27:37] drinking and all that kind of stuff. You
[1:27:39] know, we you know, we don't need all we
[1:27:41] just tell us about. So, what am I
[1:27:43] supposed to preach? Just preach love.
[1:27:45] Just love.
[1:27:46] I said, well,
[1:27:48] I can't do that. She goes, well, she
[1:27:51] goes, we're having another meeting
[1:27:52] tomorrow night and we you're invited.
[1:27:54] They had to without me. You're invited.
[1:27:56] And said, we'll discuss it. I said,
[1:27:58] "Well, there's no reason to discuss it
[1:27:59] cuz I said, you know, y'all, it's your
[1:28:03] church. Everything in here I brought
[1:28:05] you, take it, keep it." But I said, "I
[1:28:07] can't do that." So anyway, we headed we
[1:28:10] headed, first of all, we headed to a
[1:28:12] little church in Boswell that I had used
[1:28:13] to evangelize in years ago. I thought,
[1:28:15] "Well, I'm down here. I'll just go see
[1:28:17] if they need somebody," which turns out
[1:28:19] they didn't have no preacher. And I was
[1:28:21] trying to share some brother random with
[1:28:22] them, but I got shut down pretty quick
[1:28:24] on that. So I thought well you know I
[1:28:27] told the brother about after three or
[1:28:28] four weeks I said well it don't look
[1:28:30] like this is working for me and I don't
[1:28:32] want to disrupt your church in any way.
[1:28:34] So I said I think if you can find
[1:28:36] somebody I let them take over because I
[1:28:38] said I don't know I'm going to do you
[1:28:39] any good and he said well brother that's
[1:28:41] fine. He said it's fine. And a couple
[1:28:43] days later he called me said we got
[1:28:45] somebody brother. I fast and I got and
[1:28:47] of course I left PA system all that
[1:28:49] stuff there. And so what I said I'll
[1:28:51] leave that for you if you want it. Oh no
[1:28:52] no brother. You just come get it. I said
[1:28:53] well. Yeah. I said, "When you want me,
[1:28:55] just come in the morning." I mean, he
[1:28:56] was ready to get me out of there. And
[1:28:58] bless his heart. So, I went and picked
[1:29:00] it up and u I got I know I no sooner got
[1:29:04] in the truck. I'm literally 15 minutes
[1:29:06] after I got in the truck, I get a phone
[1:29:08] call from the people that was renting my
[1:29:10] church that I had up here and they said,
[1:29:12] "Brother Dave said, we uh want to let
[1:29:15] you know we we bought us another church.
[1:29:17] We bought us a church and we're going to
[1:29:19] be moving out the end of the month." And
[1:29:20] so, he said, "You got somebody wants to
[1:29:24] at least it too since you're down there.
[1:29:25] I said no sis I'm heading back here so I
[1:29:28] don't want I said that's fine. I mean
[1:29:30] God just worked another miracle. I've
[1:29:32] seen so many miracles that God does and
[1:29:35] he just felt it together because we come
[1:29:36] back here. I did that for seven years
[1:29:38] but I'm not a pastor.
[1:29:41] I'm just outreach. I I rather one-on-one
[1:29:44] witness and and I let these preachers
[1:29:47] that know what they're doing on
[1:29:48] pastoring. But God has done many many
[1:29:51] good things for us. Um, so I think is
[1:29:53] that the last one I think?
[1:29:56] Okay, I think that's it. Is that right,
[1:29:58] sis?
[1:30:01] Okay. Your keys to victory. The word
[1:30:02] rightly divided. We studied the word of
[1:30:04] God to have a good understanding of what
[1:30:05] it means to be saved and how much God is
[1:30:08] for us. The whole armor of God in order
[1:30:10] to effectively fight the enemy with
[1:30:12] Ephesians 6:13.
[1:30:14] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:30:16] might be able to withstand in the evil
[1:30:18] day. Amen. God bless you.
[1:30:22] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Well, did you enjoy that?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we sure do appreciate
[1:30:34] brother uh brother David coming and and
[1:30:38] ministering and um uh brother
[1:30:43] brother Roman has always been a an
[1:30:46] outreach uh witnessing
[1:30:50] and uh winning souls to the Lord and and
[1:30:53] he's always been a great inspiration to
[1:30:55] me and um anywhere that that he can he
[1:31:00] it does not matter matter what
[1:31:01] denomination or what uh what church if
[1:31:06] uh they give he gets the opportunity he
[1:31:08] goes and shares the hope that is within
[1:31:11] him and um and so I knew you would be
[1:31:15] blessed here tonight and we just we just
[1:31:17] want to say God richly bless you brother
[1:31:20] David
[1:31:23] greet sister Susan for us amen
[1:31:28] um and so we're just we're just so
[1:31:30] thankful for what the Lord is doing. And
[1:31:32] you know, truly, we do have um we've all
[1:31:35] been given different gifts. And um
[1:31:39] there's one thing that I I've always
[1:31:42] admired even about Brother Donald. Uh
[1:31:44] Brother Donald is is a soul winner. He's
[1:31:47] always witnessing to somebody and uh
[1:31:51] talking to them about Christ. And I say
[1:31:55] re remember this as I was trying to
[1:31:58] bring out this morning.
[1:32:00] The Lord saved us for a reason. He's
[1:32:03] called us for a reason. Not not for us
[1:32:07] just to say, "Okay, now I'm just waiting
[1:32:09] for heaven." Amen. But we see ourselves
[1:32:12] in scripture. We see that the anointing
[1:32:16] is upon us. And I believe that we need
[1:32:18] to share, Amen. our our our love. share
[1:32:23] our testimonies, share these things that
[1:32:26] God has done for us. Don't don't let it
[1:32:28] be us four and no more. Amen. The church
[1:32:33] the church is a hospital.
[1:32:35] Amen. Our our church is is a this place
[1:32:39] is a is a hospital. And uh it's not a
[1:32:43] museum. It's a It's a place where the
[1:32:46] hurting and the broken and the sinners
[1:32:50] can come and find a living Jesus Christ.
[1:32:53] And that living Jesus Christ turns
[1:32:56] around and makes you, deputizes you to
[1:32:59] cast out devils, to heal the
[1:33:01] brokenhearted, to heal the sick. Amen.
[1:33:04] He anoints you to do that. You become
[1:33:08] Amen. I came broken, but today I am
[1:33:11] giving what God has given me. You have
[1:33:13] come broken, but today God has anointed
[1:33:16] you to go out and to to declare the
[1:33:20] gospel of Jesus Christ. Aren't you glad
[1:33:23] for that? You don't have to be a
[1:33:24] preacher.
[1:33:26] You don't have to be a a prominent
[1:33:28] member in the community.
[1:33:30] All you have to have is a touch from the
[1:33:32] Lord. And when you have a touch from the
[1:33:35] Lord, there's somebody outside. There's
[1:33:39] somebody maybe next door to you. There
[1:33:42] may be somebody, Amen, that is that is
[1:33:46] uh across town or you're working with.
[1:33:50] Somebody needs to hear what Jesus has
[1:33:53] done for you. Amen. And I I don't think
[1:33:57] we should just share it with somebody
[1:34:00] else.
[1:34:01] We should, but we should have plenty of
[1:34:04] grace for one another. I need to have
[1:34:06] plenty of grace for my wife. She needs
[1:34:09] to have plenty of grace for me. We
[1:34:11] should have plenty of grace for our
[1:34:13] children. You children should have
[1:34:14] plenty of grace for your for your
[1:34:16] parents. Amen. They the love of God is
[1:34:20] not just for outside our church or
[1:34:23] outside our home,
[1:34:25] but it's the grace of God, the strength
[1:34:27] of God that is within us, that is within
[1:34:30] our church, that's within our homes.
[1:34:33] Amen. And it's that grace of God that
[1:34:35] has moved upon us that gives us that we
[1:34:40] need to help those around us. Can you
[1:34:44] say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:34:47] Amen. I I I remember as as as uh as
[1:34:52] brother Roman, you know, was given some
[1:34:54] of his testimonies and he does have he
[1:34:56] brother Roman has a lot of testimonies
[1:34:59] and I've always loved those testimonies
[1:35:00] over the years. Um, it's sort of like
[1:35:04] it's sort of like getting around Brother
[1:35:05] Forest, you know, just a just a lot of
[1:35:08] testimonies of what God has has done.
[1:35:11] And uh
[1:35:13] but you know the zeal I mean uh that
[1:35:18] that zeal that we that we had you know
[1:35:22] um even even sister Carol I was 19 when
[1:35:25] I come to Ponyie you know and uh uh I
[1:35:30] was just as dumb and stupid as as as as
[1:35:34] could be. But you know, I had a desire
[1:35:36] to share
[1:35:39] to share what I had. That's all I and I
[1:35:41] didn't have much, but I had Jesus.
[1:35:45] But you know, I don't tire of telling
[1:35:48] people about the love of God. In fact,
[1:35:52] um
[1:35:54] I'm more I'm I've always been more at
[1:35:57] home if I'm at oneonone with somebody
[1:36:00] and um letting them know the love of the
[1:36:03] Lord and and and reaching out to them.
[1:36:06] So I say today, don't leave it to the
[1:36:09] preacher.
[1:36:11] Don't leave it Don't leave it to uh the
[1:36:15] deacons or the trustees.
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:19] Why don't we win some souls to the Lord
[1:36:21] today? And u I I believe this message
[1:36:25] that brother David brought today. Amen.
[1:36:27] He has changed us from death unto life.
[1:36:32] And we've got a testimony to tell. Amen.
[1:36:36] Praise the Lord. Have you enjoyed
[1:36:38] yourself in the house of the Lord today?
[1:36:41] Amen.
[1:36:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:47] Amen.
[1:36:48] I um I'm so thankful.
[1:36:53] Amen. The uh I was trying to think of
[1:36:56] that song. Matter of fact, let's just
[1:36:58] sing that the old song. Amazing grace.
[1:37:03] Amazing
[1:37:07] grace.
[1:37:09] How sweet
[1:37:12] the sound
[1:37:15] that saved
[1:37:18] a wretch
[1:37:21] like me.
[1:37:27] I once
[1:37:30] was lost,
[1:37:33] but now
[1:37:36] I'm found.
[1:37:38] I was blind
[1:37:41] but now
[1:37:44] I see.
[1:37:46] Let's do another verse of that.
[1:37:49] What was grace
[1:37:53] that taught oh glory my heart
[1:37:59] to fear
[1:38:02] and grace
[1:38:04] my fears
[1:38:08] relieved
[1:38:12] how preious
[1:38:16] did
[1:38:19] That grace
[1:38:21] appear
[1:38:24] the I
[1:38:28] first
[1:38:32] believe.
[1:38:36] Mercy said no.
[1:38:40] I'm not going to let you go.
[1:38:44] I'm not going to let you slip away.
[1:38:48] You don't have to be afraid.
[1:38:52] Mercy said no.
[1:38:55] Sin will never take control.
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:38:59] Life and death stood face to face.
[1:39:03] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[1:39:10] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:39:13] Mercy said no. One more time. Mercy
[1:39:18] said, "No,
[1:39:20] I'm not going to let you go.
[1:39:24] I'm not going to let you slip away. You
[1:39:28] don't have to be afraid.
[1:39:32] Mercy said no.
[1:39:36] Sin will never take control.
[1:39:40] Life and death stood face to face.
[1:39:43] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[1:39:49] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:39:53] Mercy
[1:39:55] said, "No."
[1:39:58] Hallelujah.
[1:40:00] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:40:04] Hallelujah.
[1:40:05] Devil says, "Well, you know,
[1:40:09] God's brought you so far, but it I don't
[1:40:11] know. I I still got a hold of you. Why
[1:40:14] don't you just tell the devil that my
[1:40:16] name was written in that book and it was
[1:40:18] a long time before I gave my heart to
[1:40:20] the Lord? And the reason I gave my heart
[1:40:23] to the Lord is because my name is in
[1:40:25] that book.
[1:40:27] And he's not going to lose me. He's not
[1:40:30] going to let me go. I love him. I may be
[1:40:33] struggling. I may be. But I'm here to
[1:40:35] tell you, I'm a son of God. I'm a
[1:40:38] daughter of God. And I believe God's
[1:40:40] grace is upon me. And brother, I just
[1:40:43] want to let you know that right now. I
[1:40:45] don't care how bad Satan is fighting
[1:40:47] you. I don't You say, "Well, I I I'm I'm
[1:40:50] fighting so hard. I must not be
[1:40:52] righteous anymore." As brother David put
[1:40:53] it tonight, there's only one way that
[1:40:56] you will ever be righteous, and that's
[1:40:59] by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:02] Amen.
[1:41:04] That's the only way you'll ever be
[1:41:05] righteous.
[1:41:07] My righteousness will never do me any
[1:41:09] good. Well, I've been a preacher now for
[1:41:11] a long time. Been pastoring now for a
[1:41:13] long time. That that that equals me a
[1:41:16] one big zero with God.
[1:41:19] So, what does that do to me? That that
[1:41:22] causes me to rely upon the Lord Jesus.
[1:41:26] I'm relying upon him. He's the one that
[1:41:30] started me and I'm relying on him to
[1:41:32] finish me.
[1:41:35] And sometimes I might miss the mark, but
[1:41:37] you know what? The blood of Jesus Christ
[1:41:40] was not for the devil's children.
[1:41:44] The blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus shed
[1:41:47] his blood for his sons and his daughters
[1:41:51] that were lost in sin. So when I make a
[1:41:54] mistake, you know what I do? I come and
[1:41:57] I say, "God, forgive me. Wash me again
[1:42:00] with your blood." And you know what? I'm
[1:42:03] just as righteous at that point. I don't
[1:42:06] have to go through all of this this uh
[1:42:10] uh uh earning my way and I've got to
[1:42:12] pray for two weeks before I can be
[1:42:14] forgiven. I can repent and the moment
[1:42:17] that I repent, God's blood has washed my
[1:42:21] sins away.
[1:42:24] Hallelujah. Well, I just want to tell
[1:42:26] you that's the way the Bible teaches it
[1:42:29] and that's the way that I believe it.
[1:42:31] and Satan, you can't condemn me. And I
[1:42:34] I've got a promise. God's word has
[1:42:36] already said he will perfect me until
[1:42:40] the day of his coming. And I just say
[1:42:43] I'm dumb enough to believe it. Do you
[1:42:45] believe it? I believe it. Amen. He that
[1:42:50] has started a good work in you will be
[1:42:56] faithful to complete it. Amen. Well,
[1:43:01] praise the Lord. There was just a lot of
[1:43:02] good word preached here tonight. Amen.
