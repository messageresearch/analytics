[33:24] interpret your word to our hearts and
[33:27] we'll give you glory and honor in the
[33:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the
[33:32] church say amen and amen God bless you
[33:35] you may be seated praise the
[33:39] Lord amen so we uh we want to turn uh in
[33:45] our books here tonight to uh we're going
[33:48] to start on page
[33:50] 119 and
[33:52] um uh we're going to start down here at
[33:55] the last paragraph now
[33:58] we
[34:00] um we're going to deal with tonight
[34:04] we're um we're going to examine the two
[34:09] spirits and the two churches and that's
[34:12] uh that's this is going to be all
[34:16] throughout the Book of Revelation so
[34:17] there's two Spirits there's the spirit
[34:19] of Christ and then there is the spirit
[34:21] of the
[34:22] Antichrist there is the true church and
[34:26] then there is the false church amen and
[34:30] so uh and and and I want to say that the
[34:33] Book of Revelation is was clearly
[34:37] written for the elect amen it's clearly
[34:40] written for the elect it's it's only for
[34:43] the elect amen now now this is I want
[34:47] you to understand that because only in
[34:50] this last day can the can can the church
[34:54] say that we have have the correct
[34:59] understanding of the symbols of the Book
[35:02] of
[35:03] Revelation now that that's major that's
[35:06] major but but but this only in the days
[35:10] of the voice of the seventh angel amen
[35:14] will the mysteries of of of uh as as as
[35:19] proclaimed by the prophets be finished
[35:22] so the mystery is has has been complete
[35:25] in this day now if you are not going
[35:28] through that seventh Angels message now
[35:30] you say well you're just putting it on
[35:32] on one man well I I I am but I'm only
[35:37] I'm only repeating what God says in the
[35:40] day put it up there uh Revelations
[35:43] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[35:48] seventh angel when he should begin to
[35:52] sound the mystery of God should be
[35:58] finished as he ha declared to his
[36:01] servants the prophets so so I'm just
[36:05] simply amen uh echoing what God's
[36:09] already said that's right amen now the
[36:12] scripture says that uh behold I send
[36:15] Elijah the prophet before that great and
[36:19] terrible day of the Lord and He singular
[36:24] he shall turn the hearts of the children
[36:28] back to the fathers this is just before
[36:32] the coming of the Lord so so we we we've
[36:36] got to understand amen that that there
[36:39] are many interpretations and many
[36:43] Revelations out there and eschatology
[36:45] and the Book of Revelation and all of
[36:47] this is I mean this is the number one
[36:49] topic everyone's talking about it amen
[36:52] uh and and and and a lot of those guys I
[36:55] I I seen a little clip today um where
[36:58] where John heggy has has um uh he he he
[37:03] was he was proclaiming you know uh my
[37:06] phone uh knows what I what I do and so
[37:09] it's always sending me to preachers and
[37:11] so uh uh and and so it you know it had a
[37:15] little little clip of him uh answering
[37:18] questions about the solar eclipse and
[37:20] things and and he said that he sold 1
[37:23] million copies of his book of the four
[37:26] blood moons and so he's he's done really
[37:28] well with W with that and the thing is
[37:32] amen hallelujah it's not
[37:36] even concerned by God yeah it was never
[37:41] even brought up by the seventh angel
[37:43] messenger it was never well praise the
[37:45] Lord so so we've got a million copies
[37:49] that have been sold and these guys are
[37:51] going to the Book of Revelations and
[37:52] they're claiming they've got the
[37:54] Revelation and yet only the El fact who
[37:58] has heard the voice of God have the true
[38:03] Revelation you say boy if that ain't an
[38:05] a cult that then if that if if this is
[38:07] an Ault then the Bible's Ault the Bible
[38:09] said that he's going to send a prophet
[38:11] before the coming of the great and
[38:13] terrible day of the Lord and he came and
[38:17] I say thank you Jesus can you say amen
[38:20] amen now now I want you to understand
[38:24] that the Mysteries they were written in
[38:26] a mystery but those Mysteries had to be
[38:30] expressed there there're in Mark 4
[38:33] and10 uh let's just read that and I and
[38:36] and actually why don't you all all of
[38:38] you kids and you young people turn there
[38:40] this is something that that you should
[38:43] know be able to quote this because um
[38:47] this is this should be a part of your
[38:49] belief system amen that Mark Mark four
[38:53] Mark 4 and10 this is something that
[38:55] really that that that that that uh
[38:58] catalyzed my Revelation and my stand on
[39:01] what I believe today um this this
[39:04] revelation of this scripture and when he
[39:06] was alone they that were about him with
[39:09] the 12 asked him of the parable and he
[39:12] said unto them unto you it is given to
[39:17] know the mystery of
[39:19] God but unto them that are without all
[39:24] these things are done in Parable that
[39:26] see they may see and not perceive
[39:31] hearing they
[39:33] hear and not understand lest at any time
[39:37] they should be converted and their sins
[39:40] should be forgiven them now did they
[39:42] understand the parable no that's the
[39:45] reason they're asking they're asking we
[39:48] don't understand what this Parable is
[39:50] and then the next verse the next verse
[39:52] then Jesus says Amen on the next verse
[39:56] and he said unto them know ye not this
[39:58] Parable how then will ye know all
[40:01] Parables and then he begins to go in
[40:04] through so you've got to have not just a
[40:07] Bible but you've got to have the spirit
[40:11] of Revelation to reveal to you what the
[40:15] what the scripture is saying can you say
[40:17] Amen so as as we as we look through this
[40:21] and we see this then it's going to take
[40:24] a spiritual mind it's going to take a
[40:26] spiritual man and woman to do this or
[40:28] you're not going to be able to
[40:30] understand amen so as as we examine
[40:33] these things remember the original
[40:35] setting that we that we went through at
[40:37] the last at the end of the the last
[40:39] chapter amen we found that there were
[40:42] two trees there was the tree of life and
[40:44] then there was the tree of the knowledge
[40:46] of Good and
[40:47] Evil excuse me there were two sons that
[40:52] were birthed to one woman everyone say
[40:55] two sons birthed to one
[40:58] woman hallelujah amen one was the seed
[41:02] of the devil one of them was the seed of
[41:04] God so so one woman two children one one
[41:09] Church two Spirits all right both of
[41:12] them claiming both of them come out of
[41:14] the same Bible every everything else so
[41:17] as there were two sons that were birthed
[41:19] to Eve a and one was the son of of of
[41:23] the spiritual which was Adam who was the
[41:25] son of God and the other was the son of
[41:28] the evil the serpent the Incarnate devil
[41:31] amen and then we find that there were
[41:35] two worshippers in the garden amen there
[41:38] was Cain the son of the wicked one and
[41:42] then there was Abel the son of the
[41:45] righteous one they were worshippers but
[41:48] the scripture says one worshiped by
[41:51] revelation of God and knowing that hey
[41:54] there was something more than than an
[41:58] apple or an apricot there was a blood
[42:01] sin that took place and there must be
[42:05] blood amen a blood covering to cover
[42:08] that sin now the other one was by the
[42:12] the carnal perception of the Earth can
[42:15] amen he he he thought it was an apple or
[42:18] something of that nature that caused the
[42:20] death to come therefore he offered the
[42:22] fruit of the trees so the natural mind
[42:26] cannot understand the spiritual mind and
[42:29] as we're going into this remember even
[42:32] for you and me we're not coming in here
[42:34] just to read the book and and say that
[42:37] we understand there there's a lot of
[42:39] people that have read this book and it's
[42:40] not really changed their life but this
[42:42] book will change your life if it is
[42:45] divine revelation it's got to be divine
[42:49] revelation can you say Amen so so we we
[42:53] must we must look at these things it
[42:56] must be by the same inspiration that the
[43:00] prophets gave it is the same inspiration
[43:03] that came amen uh uh to the messenger of
[43:07] this day and it's the same spirit that
[43:10] must Inspire our hearts to catch it
[43:14] exactly like God gave it in the very
[43:17] beginning amen so to be cardinally
[43:20] minded M materialistically minded is
[43:23] death but to be spiritually minded is
[43:27] something that is greater can you say
[43:29] Amen materialistic minded Earthly minded
[43:33] amen uh there's no way to really
[43:36] understand the book there's a lot of
[43:37] Concepts there's a lot of these things
[43:39] it's just simply impossible it's utterly
[43:41] foolish to the individual but the
[43:44] spiritually minded the revelated uh is
[43:48] eternal life and that's where the spirit
[43:50] of God is now brother brandham would say
[43:52] and and and I want to just lay this
[43:54] Foundation before we get into the
[43:56] reading here
[43:57] and and I will restore he says but God
[44:00] through election that shakes you down a
[44:03] little bit because I'm speaking to a a
[44:05] half half a group of Armenians here amen
[44:09] he says but he says but look it was
[44:12] through election that God called Abel
[44:15] and had recompense to his reward amen he
[44:20] said Abel come not nothing beautiful he
[44:22] had he had a little old lamb out of the
[44:24] flock he didn't work it up he he did he
[44:27] didn't do something or another he didn't
[44:29] try to make big fine churches he didn't
[44:32] build this that or the other he just
[44:34] went out there wrapped grape vine around
[44:36] the Lamb's neck and and come pulling it
[44:39] I guess they didn't have any hemp in the
[44:41] day rope they so they they just come
[44:44] with a with a grape vine pulling an old
[44:46] lamb a little old lamb what a sight
[44:49] picked him up laid him on the Rock I I
[44:51] don't guess they had a lance him that
[44:53] day so they took a sharp
[44:55] rock and and pulled his head little head
[44:58] back and begin to beat him in the throat
[45:00] with it what a sight blood begin to
[45:02] sprinkle and bathe his little wool over
[45:04] like that and and the poor little old
[45:06] thing dying bleeding God looked down
[45:08] from heaven and rewarded him what was it
[45:12] spiritually minded by
[45:17] election spiritually minded by
[45:22] election oh if you're not elected to it
[45:25] can you say Amen
[45:27] Esau could not there was then there then
[45:29] there was the two twins that came down
[45:32] there was Esau and Jacob both uh had the
[45:36] same parents both had the same parents
[45:40] but one had Revelation the other was
[45:44] carnally minded God loved Jacob and God
[45:49] hated Esau Esau despised the
[45:53] birthright and Jacob all he could give
[45:57] in his mind was that Birthright that's
[45:59] all Jacob wanted was that Birthright he
[46:03] was he and and and even before he was
[46:04] converted he was trying his very best to
[46:06] get that Birthright going to try
[46:08] everything that he could can you say
[46:10] amen and so but but but the but but but
[46:14] Esau despised the birthright amen then
[46:17] brother Brandon would say so does his
[46:18] children today why do I have to do that
[46:21] for wh why why should I receive the Holy
[46:23] Ghost my religion is just as good as
[46:25] yours why should I go through all of
[46:28] that there you know why why should I
[46:30] chry at an altar why why should I steal
[46:32] away in a closet and and and just me and
[46:35] God and and and sincerely begging God
[46:38] for the Holy Ghost amen why fast and and
[46:42] pray until I know that I know that I
[46:44] know that I've got the birthright that
[46:46] I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:48] Esau seen no benefit in in in receiving
[46:54] it but Jacob on on the other hand spent
[46:59] his life looking and seeking the the
[47:04] presence of God can you say amen and I
[47:08] want to say only the
[47:11] elect are spiritually minded only the
[47:15] elect is asking God I want this more
[47:19] than I want a new car I want this more
[47:21] than I want a job I want the baptism of
[47:24] the Holy Ghost so rich in my life so
[47:27] that I can be spiritually
[47:30] minded amen can you say amen hallelujah
[47:34] so so we're we're we're thanking the
[47:37] lord for that now one one last point
[47:39] that I want to make Amen brother
[47:42] brandham would say and he's talking
[47:44] about the nine spiritual gifts and and
[47:46] he's going to tell us which gift that he
[47:49] thinks is the greatest he says now watch
[47:52] he is speaking in the last days directly
[47:53] to his body here is to the one that has
[47:56] wisdom
[47:57] oh I like this oh my here is one that'll
[48:00] shock you listen to this all right here
[48:03] here is the mind that has witness here's
[48:05] the mind that has wisdom if those Holy
[48:08] Ghost gifts didn't come down to all the
[48:11] age why did he speak this for the last
[48:14] days then if there's going to be no
[48:16] gifts in the church in the last days why
[48:19] did he direct this to the last days
[48:22] here's to the one that has wisdom
[48:24] another place he says the Pentecostal
[48:26] Church today comparing the two and
[48:29] what's happened if you'll notice the
[48:31] routine of the gifts the first is a gift
[48:34] of wisdom that is the best gift of the
[48:38] group if we don't have wisdom then we
[48:41] won't know how to use knowledge which is
[48:43] the second gift if we can't use the
[48:46] second gift without wisdom how are we
[48:49] going to use the last gift
[48:50] interpretation or to the uh next to the
[48:53] last the speaking in tongues you see our
[48:56] Z
[48:57] has ate up our wisdom our Zeal for
[49:00] denominations our enthusiasm has Aid up
[49:03] the wisdom off the vine can you say Amen
[49:06] so so the greatest desire that we could
[49:10] ever have and brother Bram says of all
[49:11] the nine spiritual gifts the greatest
[49:14] thing we could ever ask God is for
[49:17] Wisdom spiritual understanding let me
[49:21] know what you're doing and I just want
[49:24] to say amen that's why we need the
[49:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost not just
[49:29] coming and and making a decision and not
[49:32] just to saying okay I felt good so I've
[49:34] got the holy ghost or I believe and I've
[49:35] got the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost
[49:38] is the very thing that opens your eyes
[49:41] to see you're you're no longer judging
[49:43] things by the natural anymore you're no
[49:45] longer seeing things for just you and
[49:47] your family or you and your your husband
[49:50] or you and your uh uh uh your friends or
[49:53] or or or whatever you you have got a
[49:55] totally different
[49:57] set of of of of rules you totally
[50:00] different set of eyes you're looking at
[50:02] things totally different than what the
[50:04] normal man or woman here on this Earth
[50:07] does you are seeing everything Through
[50:10] The Eyes Of God well that's a great gift
[50:14] brother I I I believe we need the
[50:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[50:20] now if uh uh uh you know one other thing
[50:24] we read this let's turn to the page 30
[50:26] keep your page that we're fixing to
[50:27] start on but turn turn to page 30 just
[50:29] real quick I just reminded of this amen
[50:32] page 30 all the way down to the very
[50:34] last paragraph if Revelation is beyond
[50:37] you look up and seek God for it that is
[50:42] the only way you are ever going to get
[50:46] it Revelation has to come from God it
[50:51] never comes by human natural endowments
[50:54] but by spiritual endo
[50:57] you can even memorize the scripture and
[51:00] though that is wonderful that won't do
[51:02] it it has to be a revelation from God it
[51:05] says in the word that no man can say
[51:08] that Jesus is Christ except by the Holy
[51:10] Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost
[51:13] and then and only then can the spirit
[51:16] give you the Revelation that Jesus is
[51:18] the Christ God be anointed no man knows
[51:21] the things of God save the spirit of God
[51:24] and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals
[51:26] the
[51:27] we need to call on God for Revelation
[51:30] more than anything else in the world
[51:33] we've accepted the Bible we have
[51:35] accepted the great truths of it but it
[51:38] still is not real to most people because
[51:42] the Revelation by the spirit is not
[51:44] there the word has not been quickened
[51:48] amen so let's go here to
[51:51] page9 so we want the words to be
[51:53] quickened amen amen all right
[51:57] um
[51:58] 119 and um and he's he's uh dealing with
[52:03] u uh we're going to all the way down to
[52:04] the very last paragraph Revelations 29b
[52:07] I know the blasphemy of them which say
[52:10] they are Jews and are not but are of the
[52:13] synagogue of
[52:15] Satan uh they are the synagogue of Satan
[52:18] here here is a verse that will bear
[52:20] considerable thought not only because it
[52:23] is most peculiar in its contents but but
[52:26] also it is virtually repeated in an age
[52:30] that is over a thousand years later
[52:33] Revelations 2:9 I Know Thy works and thy
[52:37] tribulation and thy poverty but Thou Art
[52:41] rich I know the blasphemy of them that
[52:44] say they are Jews and are not but are
[52:46] the synagogue of Satan to to begin with
[52:50] the word Jews does not describe the
[52:53] religion of the Jewish people it refers
[52:56] only to the people of Judah and has the
[52:59] same precise meaning as if I were to say
[53:02] I was Irish born these people were
[53:06] saying that they were actually Jews real
[53:08] Jews by birth they were Liars they were
[53:12] not Jews by birth and they weren't Jews
[53:14] by religion if all this is true what
[53:18] were they they were a deceived people
[53:22] who were already part of the church they
[53:25] belonged to the false Vine now now as we
[53:29] you remember when when we first started
[53:31] I I I was told you there's going to be
[53:32] the two Vines amen that false Vine and
[53:35] it's all within the framework of the
[53:38] Christian church one church one woman
[53:41] two children one woman two children are
[53:45] you understanding so within the
[53:46] framework of the Christian Church
[53:49] there's already this false Vine now it
[53:52] says now they were not of the true
[53:55] church but of of the false church
[53:57] because God said they were the synagogue
[54:00] of Satan now the word for synagogue is
[54:02] not the same word we use for church in
[54:05] the Bible Church means the called out
[54:07] ones or the summoned ones the psalmist
[54:10] said about these elect people blessed is
[54:13] the man whom thou choosest and causest
[54:17] to approach unto thee that he may dwell
[54:20] in thy courts Psalm 65 and4 but the
[54:23] meaning of synagogue is assembly or
[54:27] gathering this can be good or bad but in
[54:29] this case it is bad for these are they
[54:32] who whose assembling is not of God but
[54:36] of their own selves Isaiah said unto
[54:39] them they shall surely gather together
[54:43] but not by me whosoever Shall Gather
[54:47] together against thee shall fall for thy
[54:51] sake uh Isaiah 54
[54:54] and5 since the were uh surely against
[54:59] the True Vine God will one day deal with
[55:02] them in destruction now why do we have a
[55:06] people mixed within the framework of the
[55:09] church and calling themselves Jews the
[55:13] reason is this since they were Liars
[55:16] they could make any claim they wished
[55:19] they could say what they wanted as
[55:21] though it were a fact and then stick to
[55:24] it in this case
[55:26] they could be lying with a very powerful
[55:29] thought in mind was it not so that the
[55:31] Earthly church or the early church was
[55:34] almost if not
[55:35] entirely composed of Jews making them
[55:39] the original members of his body the TW
[55:42] apostles were Jews the later apostles
[55:44] were either Jews or prelit thus for men
[55:47] to swear they were Jews would give them
[55:52] preeminence and a claim to
[55:54] originality tell
[55:57] stick to it never mind Factor history
[56:01] just say it and keep saying it to the
[56:03] people and soon the people will receive
[56:07] it
[56:09] wow
[56:12] wow
[56:13] wow h h h how how how is it that we have
[56:18] got all of this religion we have got
[56:20] Christianity today and it don't even you
[56:23] don't even it don't look nothing like
[56:25] the Bible
[56:26] yeah somebody has said it and said it
[56:31] and said it and said it until people
[56:34] believe it and they can read it right in
[56:36] the Bible and think well they've got a
[56:38] better understanding about it than I do
[56:40] I apparently I don't know what I'm I'm
[56:42] just I'm following what they're saying
[56:44] no whatever it says is is what it is and
[56:48] those teachers are
[56:50] wrong wow wow wow
[56:52] wow this this going to come up but there
[56:55] there Ju Just real quick sister Keys If
[56:56] You' put Revelation 17
[56:59] and8 and and um we're not going to get
[57:02] to it tonight but I just want you to
[57:03] look at this but the Beast the Beast is
[57:05] the power that's the anointing of the
[57:08] devil the Beast that thou sawest was and
[57:12] is not shall Ascend out of the
[57:15] bottomless pit and go into predition now
[57:17] the Beast that was that's the that's the
[57:20] that's the world power that's Rome that
[57:22] thou sawest it was that was the last
[57:25] Roman power and is not that Roman the
[57:28] the the world power ceased and and yet
[57:32] it comes back and it shall descend it
[57:35] shall come back Ascend out of the
[57:37] bottomless pit what is a what is the
[57:40] bottomless pit brother brandom taught us
[57:42] the bottomless pit is religion without a
[57:48] foundation the bottomless pit is
[57:52] religion with no
[57:55] Foundation and then he says and shall go
[57:57] into predition it shall go into hell
[58:01] amen that's brother bram's
[58:02] interpretation of it and and they that
[58:04] dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose
[58:06] names were not written in the Lamb's
[58:08] Book of Life when they Shall Behold the
[58:10] Beast that was is not and yet is can you
[58:14] say Amen so so what it went down in in
[58:18] Pagan Rome it came back in Pap roome
[58:23] amen so so this is what this is what
[58:25] we're dealing with here amen it would it
[58:28] happened in this day amen in that in in
[58:32] our generation in this Roman Empire it
[58:35] comes back Hallelujah and and if there's
[58:38] ever a church that is built without any
[58:40] kind of foundation we're living in it
[58:42] amen now let's let's continue reading
[58:45] now did you catch something there isn't
[58:48] that the same that that same spirit in
[58:51] uh right in the church today isn't there
[58:54] a group that claims they are the
[58:55] original and true church and that
[58:58] salvation is found only in her don't
[59:01] they claim that they have the Keys of
[59:02] the Kingdom which they received from
[59:05] Peter don't they claim that Peter was
[59:07] their first pope and that he resided in
[59:10] Rome when it was absolute there is
[59:12] absolutely no historical fact for it and
[59:15] and even her most educated and knowing
[59:19] adherence believe her
[59:21] lives Satan's synagogue if Satan be her
[59:25] father and he the father of Lies then it
[59:27] is not strange that those in his
[59:29] synagogue are liars also consider the
[59:33] the thought of blasphemy these are
[59:35] Satan's
[59:36] synagogue uh these of Satan's synagogue
[59:38] were not blaspheming God in this
[59:40] instance though that goes without saying
[59:42] but they were blaspheming the true
[59:44] church certainly as Cain persecuted and
[59:47] killed
[59:48] Abel because he Cain was of that Wicked
[59:52] one and as the dead formal judaic
[59:55] followers Jesus said they were of their
[59:57] father the devil tried to destroy the
[1:00:00] Christians in the first few years of the
[1:00:03] first age now this same group The False
[1:00:06] fine is even more strongly attempting to
[1:00:10] destroy the True Believer in the second
[1:00:12] age the Antichrist spirit is growing the
[1:00:16] group that inched its way ever so slowly
[1:00:20] into the church by its Deeds
[1:00:23] nanism no longer fears exposure
[1:00:26] but is openly organized in a group of
[1:00:29] its own assembling and is coming against
[1:00:32] the true church in undisguised hostility
[1:00:36] and Buddy it was a bloody it was a Satan
[1:00:41] was after that early
[1:00:44] church he says now when I say this was
[1:00:46] an organized Antichrist church I'm
[1:00:49] giving you the truth from authenticated
[1:00:51] history the first church founded in Rome
[1:00:54] we will Trace its history in the manian
[1:00:56] age had already turned the truth of God
[1:01:00] into a Lie by introducing a Pagan
[1:01:03] religion with Christian names and
[1:01:05] meaning by the second age it was so
[1:01:08] Pagan though claiming to be the true
[1:01:11] church that polycarp came about 1,500
[1:01:15] miles at a very old age to plead with
[1:01:18] them to turn back they would not do it
[1:01:22] they had a solid hierarchy and a solid
[1:01:25] organization ation a complete departure
[1:01:28] from the word this then is Satan's
[1:01:32] synagogue full of
[1:01:35] blasphemy in which they were already the
[1:01:39] seeds in which were already the seeds of
[1:01:41] the doctrine of
[1:01:43] nianis which would shortly be the actual
[1:01:46] seat and power of satanic religion this
[1:01:49] is exactly right for Revelations 29b
[1:01:53] does not say these people are of the syn
[1:01:56] of Satan's synagogue it says they are
[1:01:58] Satan's synagogue the spirit of
[1:02:01] antichrist is not new this is not
[1:02:04] something that just came in in in the
[1:02:06] church ages it has been here all along
[1:02:10] to get a clear understanding of how it
[1:02:12] works how it goes against God and takes
[1:02:14] over the church look at the Old
[1:02:16] Testament and see there let us examine
[1:02:18] the spirit as it was manifest in Israel
[1:02:21] as she came out of Egypt to be the
[1:02:23] church in the wilderness just as the
[1:02:26] early church started out under the pure
[1:02:28] Ministry of the holy spirit with signs
[1:02:30] and wonders and manifestations such as
[1:02:33] prophecy tongues interpretation wisdom
[1:02:36] knowledge and healing so in in the days
[1:02:40] of Israel when they left Egypt they were
[1:02:42] under the leadership of the spirit of
[1:02:44] God manifesting in gifts God was the
[1:02:47] leader of the people actually he was
[1:02:49] their King he was a father King he took
[1:02:53] care of Israel and like a man cares for
[1:02:55] his family he fed them fought their
[1:02:58] battles smoothed away their difficulties
[1:03:01] settled their problems he just busied
[1:03:04] himself over them they were the only
[1:03:06] nation to which God to which he was
[1:03:09] truly God but one day they got to
[1:03:12] looking around and they saw the
[1:03:14] Philistines and other nations with Kings
[1:03:16] over them it caught their eyes and they
[1:03:19] decided that they ought to humanize
[1:03:20] their leadership so they wanted a king
[1:03:24] now God was going to humanize the
[1:03:26] leadership himself in the person of the
[1:03:28] Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of
[1:03:31] him Satan knew the plan of God so he put
[1:03:35] it in the hearts of the people to get
[1:03:37] ahead of God the word so when they when
[1:03:40] they approached Samuel and asked for a
[1:03:42] King Samuel was so dismayed that his
[1:03:45] heart almost failed him God had been
[1:03:47] leading his people through this
[1:03:49] consecrated spir uh scripture Vindicated
[1:03:53] prophet and he felt that he had been
[1:03:55] rejected he gathered the people and
[1:03:58] pleaded with them not to turn away from
[1:03:59] The God Who had carried them like
[1:04:02] children prospered them and blessed them
[1:04:04] but they persisted they said to Samuel
[1:04:07] you you've never been wrong in your
[1:04:09] leading you have never been dishonest in
[1:04:12] your financial dealings you have you
[1:04:14] have done the best to keep your best to
[1:04:16] keep us in line with the word of God we
[1:04:19] appreciate the Miracles and wisdom and
[1:04:20] provision and protection of God we
[1:04:23] believe in it we like it first
[1:04:25] furthermore we don't want to be without
[1:04:27] it it's just that we want a king to lead
[1:04:30] us to battle now of course when we go
[1:04:33] out to battle it is still Our intention
[1:04:36] to have the priest go ahead and with
[1:04:38] Judah following we will blow the
[1:04:40] trumpets and shout and sing We don't
[1:04:43] intend to stop any of that but we want a
[1:04:46] king who is one of us to lead us and God
[1:04:49] said to Samuel see they have not
[1:04:53] rejected you they have rejected me from
[1:04:57] ruling over them how tragic that was
[1:05:02] little did they realize that when they
[1:05:04] were asking when they were asking God to
[1:05:07] let them be like the rest of the world
[1:05:09] they were rejecting him because God had
[1:05:13] ordained that his people act different
[1:05:15] from the world and I just want to say we
[1:05:18] different from the world we're different
[1:05:23] amen you kids don't look at your parents
[1:05:25] and say I want to be like that no you're
[1:05:28] different you're not even close your
[1:05:31] setup is totally different from the from
[1:05:35] the setup of this Cosmos this world
[1:05:38] system this is this is God we you've got
[1:05:42] another leadership it's the spirit of
[1:05:46] divine love that is leading us brother
[1:05:48] bradam says what it is he says if you
[1:05:51] could see the funnel of it it's lve
[1:05:53] that's funneling right down into his
[1:05:56] church that we can walk according to his
[1:06:00] ways hallelujah it's not restrictions
[1:06:04] it's not it's not anything of that
[1:06:06] nature it is God's love to me and I my
[1:06:12] choosing to follow that love oh my it's
[1:06:16] just a great big love relationship
[1:06:19] between you and God and you children are
[1:06:23] blessed you're blessed to have amen
[1:06:27] parents that are wanting to follow the
[1:06:29] ways of the Lord amen and not just be
[1:06:32] religious but they are walking after the
[1:06:36] presence of God he says now he says God
[1:06:41] uh God had ordained that his people act
[1:06:42] different from the world and I now I'm
[1:06:45] saying you young people but I'm I'm
[1:06:46] saying for us all too I'm not just
[1:06:47] putting it out to you to it's every one
[1:06:50] of us but but sometimes we as the
[1:06:52] children like the children of Israel
[1:06:54] well we got our own Concepts the way we
[1:06:56] want things to go and how things should
[1:06:58] go and we we look out to the world
[1:07:00] especially when you get teenagers you
[1:07:01] want it this way or done that way God
[1:07:04] must be our
[1:07:06] leader amen they are not of the world
[1:07:09] they don't look like the world they
[1:07:11] don't act like the world they are
[1:07:13] crucified under the world and the world
[1:07:16] is crucified under them 2 Corinthians
[1:07:18] 6:17 through 18 wherefore come out from
[1:07:22] among them be ye separate sayeth the
[1:07:25] Lord
[1:07:26] touch not the unclean thing I will
[1:07:28] receive you and will be a father unto
[1:07:30] you and you shall be my sons and
[1:07:32] daughters sayith the Lord
[1:07:34] Almighty you see the one difference
[1:07:37] between Israel and the rest of the
[1:07:40] Nations was God put God to one side and
[1:07:44] Israel was like any other Nation when
[1:07:48] Samson cut off his hair he was like any
[1:07:50] other man put the leadership of the Holy
[1:07:53] Ghost aside in the church is nothing but
[1:07:55] the world with God's name attached to it
[1:07:58] the world and the church are of the same
[1:08:00] lump just like Jacob and Esau we're of
[1:08:04] the same parents but the spirit of God
[1:08:08] makes the difference it doesn't matter
[1:08:11] if you call yourself a Christian anyone
[1:08:14] can do that that's right the point is
[1:08:16] whether you have the spirit of God in
[1:08:18] you for without that Spirit you are
[1:08:21] repeate you are none of his amen not
[1:08:25] only not not too long ago I asked a
[1:08:28] woman if she were a Christian she said I
[1:08:30] will have you to know sir that I burn a
[1:08:33] candle every night what in the world has
[1:08:36] that got to do with it I'm a Methodist
[1:08:39] I'm a Baptist I'm a Pentecostal that
[1:08:41] hasn't a thing to do with it it is the
[1:08:44] holy ghost or
[1:08:46] Parish well starting way back there in
[1:08:48] the first church the people got to
[1:08:50] thinking and reasoning how to improve on
[1:08:52] God the Deeds of the nicians begin
[1:08:55] showing themselves then a group formed
[1:08:57] they drifted away from the pattern of
[1:08:59] the word all it takes is just one word
[1:09:04] changed and that little leaven then
[1:09:06] leavens the whole lump he then offend he
[1:09:09] that offends in one point of the law is
[1:09:11] guilty of all Eve just changed one word
[1:09:14] and that will do it when sat when when
[1:09:17] that Satan centered group was formed it
[1:09:20] began to hate and to fight the True
[1:09:22] Believers insisting that they the aliens
[1:09:25] were the church of god notice how
[1:09:28] organization breeds hatred it destroys
[1:09:31] Fellowship it makes bitter bitterness
[1:09:35] that is what myrr means this is what
[1:09:37] samna was full of bitterness the root of
[1:09:40] bitterness defiles many so more so so
[1:09:44] more and more defilement was coming in
[1:09:47] each age would feel its scars the saman
[1:09:50] church had drifted far from the original
[1:09:53] it had become a hybrid it had hybridized
[1:09:56] itself the way Eve did you know that you
[1:10:00] know that a hybrid is what comes of two
[1:10:03] species mixing the result is no longer
[1:10:06] pure like the
[1:10:08] original it is a mongrel well when Eve
[1:10:12] allowed the Beast to mingle his seed
[1:10:13] with hers she produced a creature like
[1:10:16] called Cain that wasn't pure human he
[1:10:20] was of that Wicked one notice how
[1:10:23] different he was from Abel notice how
[1:10:25] different he was from Seth he hated God
[1:10:28] and would not obey the word persecuted
[1:10:31] and killed the righteous he set himself
[1:10:34] up above the word of
[1:10:37] God the church too has departed from
[1:10:40] what she originally was she is a hybrid
[1:10:44] that is the church nominal is a hybrid
[1:10:47] people say I'm Baptist it wasn't so in
[1:10:49] the beginning I'm Methodist it wasn't so
[1:10:52] in the beginning instead of the straight
[1:10:54] word of God instead of the Spirit-filled
[1:10:57] men in the church who were led by
[1:10:59] spirit-given Revelation there are now
[1:11:02] Creeds and bylaws the educated guesses
[1:11:05] of educated men learning has taken the
[1:11:08] place of Revelation reason has replaced
[1:11:12] Faith program replaced uh spontaneous
[1:11:16] praise in the Holy Ghost it wasn't so
[1:11:18] from the beginning the whole species has
[1:11:21] changed it has become a hybrid Church
[1:11:26] now then when the church becomes
[1:11:28] hybridized will it produce pure
[1:11:30] Christians it can't the life or the seed
[1:11:34] that brings Christians to birth is not
[1:11:36] in them light BR uh brings forth light
[1:11:40] Baptists bring forth more Baptists they
[1:11:42] act like Baptist Methodist bring forth
[1:11:45] Methodist they act like Methodist not
[1:11:48] one is known by the power of God nor can
[1:11:51] they be for it's not there they are
[1:11:54] known by their ceremonial worship of God
[1:11:57] and their Creeds and dogmas talk about a
[1:12:00] hybrid do you know the most famous
[1:12:03] hybrid in the world it has been with us
[1:12:06] for ages it's the mule it's a cross
[1:12:10] between a donkey and a horse he's a
[1:12:12] funny kind of animal he can't reproduce
[1:12:14] himself he has no life that can do that
[1:12:18] yet talk about work he can outwork the
[1:12:20] horse or the donkey but watch his nature
[1:12:23] he is stubborn you can never trust him
[1:12:26] he is a perfect picture of hybrid
[1:12:28] religion a cross between truth and
[1:12:31] darkness oh God for the horse is a p is
[1:12:34] a type of the True Believer and the ass
[1:12:37] a picture of the unrighteous one mix
[1:12:39] them and you have a sterile formal
[1:12:42] religion it hasn't the seed of life it
[1:12:45] is
[1:12:46] dead you it can talk about truth but it
[1:12:49] can't produce it it doesn't have God in
[1:12:52] its myth yet it gathers together and
[1:12:55] talks about God all the while
[1:12:58] systematically denies the power they
[1:13:01] will deny the word in the very name of
[1:13:04] the
[1:13:05] Lord now that that is that is quite that
[1:13:09] that's
[1:13:10] amazing that's amazing but this is what
[1:13:13] it produced this is when you mix well
[1:13:17] this is the way I think it well I I I
[1:13:19] you you you you can't mix what God's
[1:13:22] word says and what you think it you
[1:13:25] can't mix humanism in with the pure word
[1:13:29] of God it cannot produce anything but
[1:13:32] death you cannot produce anything but
[1:13:35] death when you do that that's the reason
[1:13:39] why we've got to stay with the word
[1:13:42] that's the reason why you can sit in a
[1:13:44] message church amen and and and not be
[1:13:48] able and you're just as sterile as
[1:13:50] sterile can be because you're taking
[1:13:52] what you think and what the prophet
[1:13:54] thinks then you're trying to mix it all
[1:13:55] together and and and it just it just
[1:13:57] ain't going to work it just won't work
[1:14:00] can you say Amen you can't do that amen
[1:14:04] now so it says and there is never it
[1:14:08] says they will deny the word in the very
[1:14:11] name of the Lord and we we'll get to
[1:14:13] that in just a minute until you can you
[1:14:15] you you can you can you can say that uh
[1:14:18] uh uh there's a trinity when there's not
[1:14:20] even a trinity found in the
[1:14:22] Bible you you can say the the still the
[1:14:25] biggest religion or the biggest
[1:14:26] denomination in Christianity is still
[1:14:29] the Catholic
[1:14:31] Church where where where where in the
[1:14:33] Bible do you do you see praying with to
[1:14:36] to to Peter or to Mary where where in
[1:14:39] the Bible do you see any kind of an
[1:14:41] intercessor or Purgatory where in the
[1:14:44] Bible and they are the largest
[1:14:48] denomination of the Christian
[1:14:54] faith the reason why the scripture says
[1:14:57] that the daughters will be thrown into
[1:14:59] the same bed with the with with mother
[1:15:03] is because they came out they came out
[1:15:07] but soon as they came out God give give
[1:15:09] them a revelation and what do they do
[1:15:11] they go right back and start organizing
[1:15:13] man's Creeds and once you get men
[1:15:15] involved in it amen and Men start trying
[1:15:17] to run the church and they're trying to
[1:15:19] to do this that and the other before you
[1:15:21] know it it you the the life of God
[1:15:24] leaves that church it's just a bunch of
[1:15:27] it's just a bunch of men trying to to to
[1:15:30] to get uh to to get members into the
[1:15:32] church because the life of God is not
[1:15:34] there we and and that's and that's where
[1:15:37] it's at it's got to be that real Divine
[1:15:41] relationship between me and
[1:15:44] God real Divine oh I I tell you if we
[1:15:47] let if we have that real Divine
[1:15:49] relationship between me and God even
[1:15:52] your natural thoughts would change amen
[1:15:55] your spiritual thoughts will definitely
[1:15:56] change but You' begin to you'd begin to
[1:15:58] sense the spirit of God in your every
[1:16:01] every uh uh daytoday walk with him the
[1:16:05] presence of God would be there
[1:16:07] convicting here and pulling you aside
[1:16:09] here and doing this here why because
[1:16:12] it's the presence of God living it's not
[1:16:16] a religion it's it's the power of life
[1:16:20] it's God's life living in human
[1:16:23] beings Hallelujah now now brother
[1:16:27] brandham is fixing to say now he's
[1:16:28] fixing to show that there was blood that
[1:16:31] was that was made available uh uh for
[1:16:35] the donkey amen and there's blood made
[1:16:38] available for uh uh the horse but
[1:16:41] there's no blood in the in the in the
[1:16:43] Old Testament that was made for the mule
[1:16:46] it says now they deny the word in the
[1:16:48] name of the in the very name of the Lord
[1:16:52] and there is never any hope for them
[1:16:55] do you realize that no organization or
[1:16:57] organized religion ever had a Revival
[1:16:59] never once they organized they died they
[1:17:02] can't come back no sir I can show you
[1:17:05] that in a type in Exodus 13-13 every
[1:17:08] firstling of an ass shall th Thou shalt
[1:17:11] redeem with a lamb and if thou will not
[1:17:14] redeem it then Thou shalt break his neck
[1:17:17] and all of the firstborn of the man
[1:17:20] among thy children Thou shalt
[1:17:22] redeem they ask can be redeemed every
[1:17:27] miserable sinner can be Redeemed by the
[1:17:30] blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ or in
[1:17:33] rejecting Christ be rejected himself but
[1:17:37] you don't redeem the mule there is no
[1:17:41] Redemption for him there is no blood for
[1:17:44] him there can't be because the mule
[1:17:46] takes refuge in the church the ass takes
[1:17:49] refuge in the blood the mule has no seed
[1:17:52] in him that can be quickened but the ass
[1:17:55] has seed why why just a few weeks ago I
[1:17:59] read an
[1:17:59] editorial yes it was it was an editorial
[1:18:02] by an unsaved uh businessman not not by
[1:18:06] a Christian he said that he was amazed
[1:18:08] at the churches he could not understand
[1:18:11] them they had seminaries filled with
[1:18:14] professors who taught the word of God in
[1:18:17] order to destroy it now then this man
[1:18:21] could not figure that out he was
[1:18:22] appalled by it he said that could
[1:18:25] understand the atheist or the communist
[1:18:27] or the freethinker or someone else doing
[1:18:29] that but when the church itself
[1:18:33] destroyed the word of God it was
[1:18:35] tantamount to premeditated murder there
[1:18:39] is your hybrid religion wake up
[1:18:42] America before it is too late when the
[1:18:45] church gets away from the word it will
[1:18:47] believe anything it is like Eve when
[1:18:50] Cain was born she says I've gotten a man
[1:18:54] from the Lord now watch this he says now
[1:18:57] do you realize that she really meant
[1:19:00] that she thought that she had a man from
[1:19:04] the Lord you see once she had been
[1:19:07] deceived by taking the word of Satan
[1:19:10] instead of the word of God then she then
[1:19:14] thought that whatsoever or whatever she
[1:19:16] said was right if she said she had a man
[1:19:19] from God then she had a man from God God
[1:19:23] has set laws into his Universe a good
[1:19:26] seed can only bring forth good fruit
[1:19:29] evil seed can only bring forth evil
[1:19:31] fruit now each seed though diffic or
[1:19:34] different will utilize the same Earth
[1:19:37] nourishment moisture and sunshine but it
[1:19:40] will bring forth after its own kind
[1:19:43] notice the history of the of the can
[1:19:45] line notice the history of the Seth line
[1:19:48] only one difference between them the
[1:19:52] Original Seed nothing nothing
[1:19:56] else
[1:19:58] wow amen now any anyone got anything you
[1:20:02] want to say or any questions up to this
[1:20:05] point aren't you glad for the seed of
[1:20:09] God that's why we got to keep that word
[1:20:11] pure folks and in this message don't
[1:20:15] hybridize this message with something
[1:20:17] else Hallelujah I look I I look there at
[1:20:21] at the life of God Even in our in our
[1:20:24] our prophet he he is is his whole his
[1:20:29] whole being was that that word be kept
[1:20:35] pure you can hear it when his shaking
[1:20:38] when he in his bosom at at the at the
[1:20:41] beginning and and there in 48 at the
[1:20:44] first tape and you can hear it oh just
[1:20:47] radiating even greater in the last of
[1:20:50] his sermons saying stay with the word
[1:20:53] before he was saying the word is
[1:20:55] promised us the word is promised us oh
[1:20:57] we're in the and then when after the
[1:20:59] after the church re rejected it amen and
[1:21:02] they and and and they now he's starting
[1:21:04] screaming get back get back you're
[1:21:07] forsaking your very own life get back to
[1:21:10] the
[1:21:11] word and out of brother bram's very
[1:21:15] being oozed Redemption did you notice
[1:21:18] that just ooze while he was screaming
[1:21:21] out it was just bleeding wanting
[1:21:23] Redemption wanting there was such a love
[1:21:26] for him for his fellow man amen any
[1:21:29] anyone else anyone have anything you any
[1:21:32] questions
[1:21:39] yes line
[1:21:42] reproduce well that well that is that is
[1:21:46] good now it was in it was in a type it
[1:21:49] it was simply in a type uh that brother
[1:21:52] brandham was using that but the only way
[1:21:56] that you're going to ever get a
[1:21:58] mule is to hybrid is to take the word
[1:22:03] and to take man put it together and
[1:22:06] that's how it has happened all through
[1:22:08] the All Through the Ages they take the
[1:22:11] word of God put that in your heart so so
[1:22:14] while it cannot reproduce anything but
[1:22:17] yet it is you are you are still simply
[1:22:20] taking it you you are uh anytime you
[1:22:23] want a mule you're you're going to have
[1:22:24] to take the word of God and you're going
[1:22:26] to have to take a uh uh the words of a
[1:22:30] man and bring it together now so so you
[1:22:33] you understand that part
[1:22:37] now I I think though brother brandham is
[1:22:39] is bringing that in uh uh you know that
[1:22:44] about the mule and and typing him to
[1:22:46] Cain um I think what he is saying is
[1:22:49] there is the seed of the serpent that is
[1:22:52] going to be going down going to be going
[1:22:55] down through and but they themselves
[1:22:58] will take the word and and man's ideal
[1:23:02] and humanism bringing them together
[1:23:04] which will do nothing but produce death
[1:23:06] they will be teachers of death so so the
[1:23:10] seed of the serpent is still
[1:23:12] reproducing that that that seed is still
[1:23:14] reproducing but his children are are are
[1:23:19] taking that word and producing death in
[1:23:22] in their in their churches and in in
[1:23:24] religion and definitely in this in this
[1:23:27] other uh deal so you got to know in
[1:23:29] other words you got to know where to
[1:23:30] start and to stop your types you you see
[1:23:34] what I'm saying the Revival that brother
[1:23:36] Brandon was talking about is and and and
[1:23:39] not being able to produce not
[1:23:42] necessarily uh producing children but
[1:23:45] producing death so so when you take if
[1:23:50] our church here if if if our church here
[1:23:53] takes the word of of God and man man's
[1:23:57] ideas put it together it cannot produce
[1:24:00] Revival it will produce death it will
[1:24:04] stagnant if any family any family takes
[1:24:08] the word of God takes this uh uh uh
[1:24:11] man-made opinion put it this way it will
[1:24:15] die it cannot go any further you see
[1:24:19] what I'm saying now that doesn't
[1:24:21] necessarily that doesn't necessarily
[1:24:23] mean that you're not the seed of Christ
[1:24:25] that this church is not you know have
[1:24:29] have the seed of Christ in it it simply
[1:24:32] means that if you do it that way and I
[1:24:34] think we can all say Amen to that that
[1:24:36] we have tried it uh and we've all
[1:24:40] experience death when we hybridize the
[1:24:43] word of God in any area of our life it
[1:24:46] always produce death you can come back
[1:24:47] to repent and because you are a son of
[1:24:51] God you can come back repent wash
[1:24:53] yourselves and move on now is that is
[1:24:56] that does that answer your question or
[1:25:02] no
[1:25:04] well I don't I don't feel like I
[1:25:06] answered that too good we we'll get back
[1:25:07] to
[1:25:08] it I look
[1:25:18] atual you don't take dog you are going
[1:25:23] to Beed mule but if you take the word of
[1:25:26] God then you're the Seed of Abraham then
[1:25:29] you are a full-blooded horse or you're a
[1:25:32] full-blooded donkey because they're not
[1:25:34] mixing those two animals in the physical
[1:25:38] to make that working hor that working
[1:25:40] mule but in the spiritual realm each
[1:25:45] each Body of Christ is a horse or a
[1:25:51] donkey if you want to call it but in the
[1:25:52] spiritual Realm it looks more to me he's
[1:25:55] talking more in the spiritual realm that
[1:25:58] that mule can't produce so Cain could
[1:26:03] could not produce God he brought a
[1:26:05] sacrifice but it wasn't a right
[1:26:08] sacrifice he tried to worship a God but
[1:26:10] he couldn't worship God because he
[1:26:12] didn't have it in him he didn't have a
[1:26:13] seed in him to to come with the
[1:26:16] revelation of what God is that's that's
[1:26:18] that's a that's a good that's a better
[1:26:20] explanation the seat the seed of the the
[1:26:23] the seed of the serpent is not does not
[1:26:27] have the ability to produce the life of
[1:26:31] the word there's there's there's nothing
[1:26:33] to mix it with it will always go back
[1:26:36] and and and hybridize the word of God
[1:26:39] which will produce death absolutely but
[1:26:41] the seed of the serpent is the seed of
[1:26:45] the serpent is
[1:26:47] still is still multiplying they're
[1:26:49] they're still they are still here on the
[1:26:52] earth it didn't die with cane you know
[1:26:56] um so uh any any other any other y'all
[1:27:00] want to add to that um that that's a
[1:27:02] very good question
[1:27:20] actually
[1:27:23] MH
[1:27:43] another czy
[1:27:45] M well we we we know that it cannot
[1:27:49] produce we we we know that you it the
[1:27:54] anything but pure word is the pure word
[1:27:57] is the only thing that can produce pure
[1:28:01] Revival and so when you see the when you
[1:28:04] see the masses and those kinds of things
[1:28:06] coming then then you you you've got to
[1:28:11] know that according to the scripture
[1:28:14] that that we read uh that sister Keys
[1:28:16] put up there earlier that the whole
[1:28:19] world will follow after that Beast that
[1:28:24] that anointing so it's going to be this
[1:28:27] this this this this cane seed or this
[1:28:32] this this false Vine is going to grow
[1:28:36] until the whole world is full of that
[1:28:40] and so they will have their revivals and
[1:28:43] they will fill their stadiums they will
[1:28:46] have those things but it will not have
[1:28:49] anything to do with eternal life which
[1:28:52] goes back it cannot produce life as
[1:28:56] brother as brother williiam uh uh
[1:28:58] beautifully put it it cannot change it
[1:29:00] cannot change lives not not not not in a
[1:29:04] heart to go right back to the word of
[1:29:06] God to believe every word they can't
[1:29:09] produce those things so so yes it is it
[1:29:13] is a movement and it's under the name of
[1:29:15] God and it has been birthed out of the
[1:29:18] church but it is still a mule system it
[1:29:23] it can't it it it can't do it and so uh
[1:29:27] uh so the way you look at it when you
[1:29:29] when you're seeing all of these great
[1:29:30] revivals the scripture says that the
[1:29:34] that the righteous will scarly be saved
[1:29:38] then how and where shall the the The
[1:29:40] Sinner and the ungodly appear so that
[1:29:43] and and listen the scripture says that
[1:29:45] he's going to have to cut it short for
[1:29:47] the elect sake so so again thank God for
[1:29:52] a prophet or we would be those guys
[1:29:54] catching planes going down there and
[1:29:56] taking our shirts off and trying to get
[1:29:58] baptized and and uh no no the the
[1:30:02] Revival is in his word that's Hallelujah
[1:30:07] and Satan's generation will never look
[1:30:11] to a going back and dying to that word d
[1:30:14] out to that word amen all right good
[1:30:16] questions tonight any anything else
[1:30:17] before we before we go on any further
[1:30:19] any are we all understanding you young
[1:30:21] people understanding what we're reading
[1:30:27] man we like dumb
[1:30:31] questions
[1:30:46] yeah well well
[1:30:50] spiritually um well Cain or or Abel
[1:30:53] didn't not have any seed Abel was cut he
[1:30:57] was cut short he was killed there so so
[1:31:01] Cain was the one that carried the
[1:31:03] lineage of Adam on through but the
[1:31:06] question the legitimate question is is
[1:31:09] well you know where's who's where's the
[1:31:13] seed of The Serpent and where's the seed
[1:31:15] of of of um of Seth today and U because
[1:31:20] you know we need to make sure we're
[1:31:22] careful of who we marry we don't want
[1:31:23] want to marry the seed of the serpent um
[1:31:26] but actually we're all intermingled it's
[1:31:29] it's it's it's an
[1:31:30] intermingling uh so Cain's lineage
[1:31:33] seed's or uh U uh Seth's lineage it's
[1:31:39] all it's all
[1:31:41] there it it it had to have came over
[1:31:43] through the flood uh in the ark there
[1:31:45] was eight there was eight Souls that was
[1:31:47] there so the sons of Noah married uh the
[1:31:51] sons the daughters of of of U one of
[1:31:55] them married the wrong one amen and and
[1:31:58] so uh it it all intermingled so so to
[1:32:02] say today I I would say that we all um
[1:32:06] well we we all came from Eve that's for
[1:32:11] sure we we don't we don't know the exact
[1:32:15] that exact lineage as far as that goes
[1:32:17] you know Eve's the mother of us all so
[1:32:21] now so where does the seed of the
[1:32:22] serpent well just as
[1:32:26] Christ is now this the Royal seed or the
[1:32:30] spiritual Seed of
[1:32:33] Abraham so has Satan now anointed he has
[1:32:38] transformed himself into that angel of
[1:32:40] Light and he's got a seed here on Earth
[1:32:43] so it's a spiritual lineage you see what
[1:32:45] I'm saying so so we don't have to be a
[1:32:48] Jew to be a Christian no that you know
[1:32:52] the bloodline is is no long it's the
[1:32:54] Royal bloodline yes sir it's the blood
[1:32:57] of Christ that has come to redeem usall
[1:33:00] amen and so did that did that that
[1:33:03] answer your question in a well we got to
[1:33:06] tell me because I might be hearing it
[1:33:09] different
[1:33:11] okay sister
[1:33:21] Carol amen that's right
[1:33:24] listen you you you if not if not I mean
[1:33:28] I've got some wonderful family wonderful
[1:33:30] family that and and um um just you know
[1:33:34] in the charismatic move and and so you
[1:33:36] know I remember back when Trump boy I I
[1:33:40] had I had some really matter fact
[1:33:42] they're pastors there in town in in
[1:33:43] Tulsa and just tell me you got to follow
[1:33:46] this prophet and uh well man that
[1:33:49] Prophet was given I mean he had thus
[1:33:51] sayith the Lord that that Trump was
[1:33:53] going to get in and
[1:33:54] and uh and so I you know I followed it
[1:33:57] and boy I mean he was he was you know
[1:34:00] the the the one the one deal I mean he
[1:34:02] was lost in the spirit and I mean he
[1:34:04] gave a long prophecy of everything that
[1:34:07] was going to take place and I mean and
[1:34:09] it man it it looked like this guy was he
[1:34:12] was in another world and and the
[1:34:14] congregation was in another world and
[1:34:16] and and so I'm
[1:34:18] thinking man it was it was sort of
[1:34:20] making chills go up and down my spine
[1:34:23] and and then but but I had to come and
[1:34:26] but I had to come back to the
[1:34:28] word when you when you forsake the word
[1:34:31] you're just subject to anything that's
[1:34:34] and I look there and this the Trump was
[1:34:36] going to bring the Revival and the the
[1:34:38] this nation I'm thinking oh great day
[1:34:42] Hallelujah and and I you know
[1:34:46] I it was
[1:34:48] false didn't happen it didn't happen and
[1:34:52] um
[1:34:55] and he never apologized neither and he's
[1:34:57] still preaching and they's still say it
[1:34:59] say it over and over it don't make it
[1:35:02] don't you don't have to be accurate just
[1:35:04] keep what they're so blinded they are so
[1:35:08] deceived that no matter if the guy's a
[1:35:11] ranked liar claiming that God gave him
[1:35:14] the prophecy and yet they still Pat his
[1:35:17] his his wallet and bank account he still
[1:35:21] has thousands going to his church
[1:35:24] and and and he's still on the internet
[1:35:26] just all over the place he's a liar he's
[1:35:30] a deceiver but the thing is this is
[1:35:34] where we're at when you forsake the word
[1:35:39] you are game for
[1:35:41] anything amen that's right Hallelujah
[1:35:46] all right so so we are already at 8:30
[1:35:49] guys and we didn't even we didn't make
[1:35:52] it through

[1:35:59] another another page or do youall
[1:36:02] want
[1:36:09] um let's see
[1:36:11] um okay so we stopped up here at 12 did
[1:36:14] someone else have I'm sorry did someone
[1:36:16] else have something else they were
[1:36:17] another question or
[1:36:22] something Jesus Christ being the word
[1:36:26] himself and what he came to do you would
[1:36:31] think that the Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:36:33] would have been the ones that would have
[1:36:34] received him yeah yeah and yet he
[1:36:42] separated
[1:36:47] yeah Ministry of the word
[1:36:52] separated
[1:36:54] very
[1:36:56] true very
[1:37:00] true
[1:37:07] yes
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:12] amen absolutely that is that is so true
[1:37:16] it's that Living
[1:37:18] Word that and and it's and and and and
[1:37:21] in and in all reality that is very that
[1:37:23] that's the son of man that that brother
[1:37:26] bradam said that had to return and he
[1:37:29] would when he would talk about the son
[1:37:31] of man returning he would always go back
[1:37:33] to to to Hebrews 4 the word that
[1:37:37] discerns and that that divides aund and
[1:37:41] and that's where we are the Living Word
[1:37:44] not a baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:37:48] brother bradam says the Holy Ghost
[1:37:51] himself returned back to the church The
[1:37:54] Living Word Among Us and thus dividing
[1:37:59] and separating and oh don't don't don't
[1:38:02] don't just don't don't just look out
[1:38:04] there and say Well they're deceived and
[1:38:06] I'm not brother you can be deceived
[1:38:07] sitting in this church here we've got
[1:38:10] that word must discern let that living
[1:38:13] word discern everything about you can
[1:38:16] you say amen amen that that's exactly
[1:38:19] right now let's let's look here um
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:26] um okay so let's let's just read let
[1:38:30] let's just let's just re finish what
[1:38:32] this
[1:38:36] um um okay we're going to read down
[1:38:39] we're going to read down to the end of
[1:38:42] 26 here where we're already at 126 it
[1:38:44] says if you look at the statement we're
[1:38:47] we're in the first paragraph here
[1:38:48] statement of Eve real close you will
[1:38:50] notice that she had more of an
[1:38:52] understanding than most realized
[1:38:54] she did not attribute the son to Satan
[1:38:57] for that would have made him equal with
[1:38:59] God only God could create the egg in the
[1:39:03] womb of Mary Satan couldn't do that Eve
[1:39:06] knew that Satan can only pervert so he
[1:39:10] beguiled her with the wrong seed it was
[1:39:14] through it was the Serpent's Seed that
[1:39:16] brought forth Cain it was Adam's seed
[1:39:19] that brought forth Abel and Seth those
[1:39:22] seeds went through exactly the same
[1:39:24] process but the children were different
[1:39:27] for they came they were from different
[1:39:30] seeds she believed that Cain was from
[1:39:32] God she
[1:39:34] accepted the devil's lie as the truth of
[1:39:37] God that is exactly what we have now
[1:39:40] churches set themselves up as Fountains
[1:39:44] of truth but the truth is not in them
[1:39:47] yet they are begotten children swear by
[1:39:51] them and will even kill to uphold their
[1:39:54] error if you think this is an
[1:39:56] exaggeration read all of second Timothy
[1:39:59] in the chapter 3 the first five verses
[1:40:02] of the fourth chapter 2 Timothy 4:1
[1:40:05] through 5 I charge thee therefore before
[1:40:07] God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:40:11] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:40:13] appearing and his kingdom preach the
[1:40:16] word be instant in season out of season
[1:40:20] reprove rebuke exhort with all long
[1:40:23] suffering and Doctrine for the time will
[1:40:25] come when they will not endure sound
[1:40:28] Doctrine but after their own lust shall
[1:40:31] they Heap to themselves teachers having
[1:40:34] itching ears and they shall turn away
[1:40:38] their ears from the truth and shall be
[1:40:41] turned unto fables but watch thou in all
[1:40:45] things endure afflictions do the work of
[1:40:48] an evangelist and make full proof of thy
[1:40:51] Ministry when the church allowed
[1:40:54] herself to move away from the original
[1:40:57] like Adam and Eve death set in there is
[1:41:02] no strength in her she has become a
[1:41:05] monstrosity the minute the church moved
[1:41:08] toward form and ceremony and toward
[1:41:10] priesthood by organizing the ministers
[1:41:12] into a group that decided leadership
[1:41:14] apart from the Holy Spirit and his word
[1:41:18] that very moment death entered and she
[1:41:21] started to get sick and as she got sick
[1:41:24] she changed to a powerless group of
[1:41:26] people whose only weapon was argument
[1:41:29] she could not produce nothing in the
[1:41:31] spirit for her hopes were built on
[1:41:33] program and not on faith in his word
[1:41:36] they sowed program so they reap program
[1:41:39] they sowed perversion so they reaped
[1:41:42] perverted
[1:41:43] children amen so we will stop here for
[1:41:47] tonight and then we will we will finish

[1:45:16] light to

[1:45:23] going
[1:45:25] to have those personal convictions like
[1:45:29] I
[1:45:31] have I have found that not everyone is
[1:45:34] going
[1:45:35] to feel the
[1:45:38] call to come into
[1:45:42] that place the way God might draw
[1:45:47] me he talks to us all I I'm not saying
[1:45:51] that he's not going to draw meat he's
[1:45:52] not going to draw dra you to prayer like
[1:45:53] he draws me to prayer but I am saying
[1:45:57] that I'm responsible before God for my
[1:46:01] heart and I'm going to follow God in my
[1:46:05] heart you're responsible before God in
[1:46:08] your
[1:46:09] heart and you've got to follow
[1:46:13] him see organized religion says all
[1:46:16] right this is the way it's all got to be
[1:46:18] done here's the list of rules this is
[1:46:21] the way it is
[1:46:23] and when you complete the 10 things here
[1:46:25] then you're
[1:46:27] okay religion has its own way of making
[1:46:31] us feel like we've
[1:46:34] arrived but we only
[1:46:37] arrive when that great holy spirit is
[1:46:41] having
[1:46:42] preeminence in our lives that's the only
[1:46:48] way and that's the that's the way and if
[1:46:51] you've got to walk alone brother brandom
[1:46:53] says every man's got to walk
[1:46:55] alone it's a world between you and God
[1:47:00] alone it's him and him alone it's his
[1:47:06] presence with you not his presence in
[1:47:09] somebody else it's his presence in
[1:47:12] you and when we stand before him on that
[1:47:15] day we'll be
[1:47:18] responsible for his presence and you
