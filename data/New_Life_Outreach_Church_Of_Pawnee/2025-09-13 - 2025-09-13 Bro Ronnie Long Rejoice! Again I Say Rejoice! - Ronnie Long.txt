TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] But Jesus went to the wilderness to fast after the Holy Ghost had come upon him. &gt;&gt; John bear records seeing the spirit of God come up on him and he was filled with the power of God, God in him. And then he went into the wilderness to fast afterwards, not before for the Holy Ghost to come on him, but he went in and fasted after the Holy Ghost came on him. See? And now in the vision, I might say this, I mentioned it once. I was going to cut it off the tape, but I believe I'll just leave it on. I was about uh 3:00 in the morning, I suppose. I'd gotten up And I looked were in front of me and I was coming down to the Jordan. Looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine. And I was coming down to the Jordan. And seemed like I could hear the song, I'm going down to the Jordan. Someone was saying it. And as I drew near the river, I looked back and seen which way I had come. And I was twothirds of the way there to the Jordan. And uh I looked across Jordan and I said, "Oh, praise God. Just on the other side is where all the promises lay." Every promise lays in the promised land. And then I came to myself. I thought, could I possibly have could it been that I was dreaming? Uh because it's nighttime. See, a vision is something that you see with your eyes open just like a dream. You're looking right at it and you're you're conscious that you're standing like here on the platform and you're you're standing here, but yet you look like you're in a dream. It's you can't explain it. There's no way to do it. See, it's God's works and God's ways are unexplainable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have to be accepted by faith. &gt;&gt; Then as I uh sit there a little bit the side of this chair, then all of a sudden hear it come back again. Then I knew then it was vision. And then when I come into the vision again, it seemed that I was lifted up and sitting on a a highway, a narrow highway with some brother. I never knew who the brother was. I looked around. I said, "Now I am sure and know this is vision. The Lord God is here." afraid. I said, "What's everybody so afraid of?" And a voice came and said, "There's such danger in these days. There's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you." And I heard the weeds are mashing down and I looked and here come a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds. I thought, "Now, knowing this is vision, then I shall see what this uh this animal or this beast is." and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him, I knew it was a mumba. Now, a mumba is an African snake, which is the most deadly bite of all things there is. There's nothing as poison as a mumba. And the snake of course represents sin, death. And uh there is the the we have in this country the rattlesnake and the copper head and the cotton mouth moccasin. Many of those snakes that if you're in bad health and want to bite you, it would perhaps kill you, but if you didn't get aid of some sort right away. And then uh then we go into Africa and India and we find the cobra. There's a black cobra. He's a bad snake. He's a death bite, too. And there's the yellow cobra which is far beyond him. And the yellow cobra uh the patient dies with such a horrible death it dies from suffocation. It it paralyzes a breathing system and they they can't breathe and just open their mouth and gapping trying to and die like that. And that was the type of snake with just one lick from getting Billy Paul when we got the snake in Africa. And then there comes the mamba. He's dead. Just when he he's so fast you can't see him. He goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with the back of his tail. Just he's gone. Hits you in the face usually stands up high and strikes hard. And when he hits you, you've just got a few breaths till you're finished. Turn real. It don't only paralyze to get in the bloodstream. It gets nerves everything. You're just die just in a few seconds. them native boys and track boys, you can say, mumble and they'll butt their heads together and scream cause it's death just in a few seconds. See, when one hits him and here he was on the highway. I thought, well, this is it. So, I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come. But when he got right close to me, he'd run up fast and then he'd get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something hold him off. He couldn't bite me. &gt;&gt; And he turn around on the other side and try to approach from this side and he'd get back get a start and he sw towards me get slower and slower and slower and then to a stop and I just shake like that and move back. He couldn't strike him. Then he turned and looked at my friend and away he went after my friend and I seen my friend just jumping way in the air over him and over him and over him trying and a thing was striking at him. I thought, "Oh, if it ever hits him, it'll be instant death. No wonder everybody's so scared because when this thing hits you, it's an instant death. And and it was just striking him like that. I threw my hands up. I said, "Oh, God, have mercy on my brother." I said, "If that serpent ever strikes him, it'll kill him." And just then the serpent turned to me when I said that and looked at me again. And a voice came from above me and said, "You have been given power, &gt;&gt; dividing, &gt;&gt; the worst are any." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?" He said, "There's one thing you must do. You must be more sincere. &gt;&gt; You must be more sincere." I said, "Well, God, forgive me for my uncincerity and let me have sincerity." And when I raised up my hands to him again, there was a great something came over me. Just lifted me up. Seemed like it my whole body was charged with something. And I looked at the serpent and then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet. And I said, "Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I bind you." And the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made that sign like a S capital S made backwards. An sign and means bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst. Blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head when he made this backwards s that and sign like a conjunction you see. Choked it to death. and the brother was free and I went over and mashed on it. I said, "Now I've got to find out about this because it's vision." And I hit on the on the thing and it turned like that looked like a handle on a glass handle on a pitcher just made it solid crystal. And I said, "Think of that how quick that blue smoke was life and everything it left it all the elements and it's turned to glass." And just then a voice came again and said, "You can unbind him also." So I said, "Then Satan that I might know, I unbind you." And when he did, he started coming to life again, wiggling. And I said, "I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ." And when he did, the smoke flew out of him again. And he choked himself right back again and turned to crystal. And then when he did that, that voice said, "Now you must be more sincere than what you are to hear this." Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Then it left me and I was standing in the room. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A few moments I heard the clock go off and my wife had got getting up. The children, you know how it is. I guess it's your house. One, what am I going to wear today, mama? Where are my books? And what did I do? You know, you just like any home, you can't you hear yourself think hardly for all of them trying to get ready at once. And and so I slipped off into the den room and I got out on my knees and I said, "Lord Jesus, I don't know these things and what must I do?" And the children me called me to take them to school in a few moments. What must I do? And I looked around and my Bible was laying there and I said, "Lord, if you will forgive me, I do not believe in just opening up the scripture and taking something out of the Bible and saying that, but there is times that when God can comfort you by such a thing, &gt;&gt; and I said, Lord, in this case of emergency right now before your spirit leaves me and I I don't know what to do, the kids will be an hour yet before they be gone. would you just show me if that was something you're trying to get to me, heavenly father, then let me know. And I took this Bible and just pulled it open like that. And my thumb was laying at first Corinthians the 5th chapter, the 8th verse. When something reads something like this, when you come, I was planning on taking a fast to the Lord. I told him I'd go out and fast. said when you come to this feast which a fast in the body is a feast with the Lord. We know that. So when you come to this feast, don't come with the old 11 or the leaven of malice and so forth, but come with the the unele truth. Just exactly what he had told me in the vision. Come, God is my solemn judge. come with the uneven bread of sincerity and truth. That is the word. Then I seen what he meant as he years ago when I seen the Bible come down. I got it wrote right here. Come down and a hand came from heaven and pointed down to Joshua and read the first nine verses and stopped there. That's Joshua come through the wilderness. But never did he was ready. When he got near Jordan, God called him out. said, "This day I'll begin to magnify you before the people." And then he took the children of Israel across Jordan to the land where give them divided to them the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I went to the woods and prayed and prayed and fasted. And now I went back to that tree where I met where those squirrels was that you've heard in other messages. See where those squirrels was. And standing there along about 3 or four o'clock in the morning, Ed staggered through the brush for what light I could see to get to the tree, coming early because I was led there. Then I met him. God helped me to ever live true. But Oh my [Music] with me through fire. [Music] My disease I will trust in you. Yes, I trust [Music] you. [Music] I believe you're my healer.

And I'm so thankful for that here today. Amen. And we enjoyed that. Did you enjoy that song? &gt;&gt; Amen. And what can we say for sister Phelise? Amen. Come Jesus, come. As we were as she was singing that song and Amen. Uh I had never heard of of uh that that man. What's his name? Kurt. Kurt. Charlie Kirk. &gt;&gt; Charlie Kirk. Uh, I guess I'm behind times, but you know, um, a conservative figure that's that's, um, that you young people would, I guess, probably know. And how he was assassinated the other day there there on on the campus and and you look at this world and it and it is just it's just it's just crazy. It's insane. And we we see these things and and um there's no answer. There's there's no answer. Whether you're a conservative, Republican or a or a Democrat, it's it's it's all just it's all just filth. And there's not there's no one there's no Superman here on the earth. And we know that the earth is looking for a superman and a superman will come and we're really near where there's going to rise the man of sin that is that is going to try to console the world and lead the world. &gt;&gt; But it's pretty incredible that the very one God's Messiah God's Messiah is here. the bride of Jesus Christ. That's we've got something for the world, but the world doesn't want it. World doesn't want what you have. But I'm so thankful that we can take this take the words of life and the Holy Spirit as we have heard this weekend just service after service line upon line the presence of the Lord coming in and and confirming your faith. Listen friends, you have something that the world is looking for. You have a reality that no conservative figure can give you. And we're thankful for a little shine light shining. Amen. I've listened to a few clips of of Charlie and and uh we're we're glad for for light shining. But brother, you're more important than any kind of a figure. Just live Jesus Christ. Live Jesus right there in your schools, right there in your community. You have what this world needs. And though as a whole the world has turned it down, but there is still somebody out there &gt;&gt; that needs to hear what you have, &gt;&gt; they need what you've got. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we get ready for the word of the Lord here tonight, we What can we say about the service this morning? My Well, glory That was that was a wonderful wonderful message this morning and we we appreciate our our brother Zachary. Amen. Rapturing faith and uh brother Ronnie Long is is not a he's not a stranger to any of us. Uh, brother Ronnie is is um uh you know, give him a little rose here in in on this side then then wait till he's gone. But brother Ronnie is one of the most giving men that I I have ever known. If you're around Ronnie, he's going to be serving you somehow someway. And and and we we love brother Ronnie. We were we were building the building here and and uh he he pulled in when we were doing some concrete work, you know, doing the footers and and uh uh he he beat us to the concrete truck to to pay for the bill. And you know, just little little things of that. And and um every one of these men that that have ministered are are some of the most giving men. And I I say I'd say today that that uh all of these ministers, Amen. whether they've preached uh this meeting or or or not, we have got ministers who are examples. They're not just wanting to preach, but these guys have got a heart for the kingdom of God. And I I appreciate all of these. And I I and I'm not just saying it just to say they're because they're my buddies. I'm saying we are blessed &gt;&gt; to have men who care for the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're very blessed to have men that have given their lives for the cause of Jesus Christ. And we we just want to say God bless them all. As we get ready for brother Ronnie to come, we're going to have a prayer line if the Lord leads brother Ronnie that way. Uh we're not going to put God in a box. just however the Lord wants to work. But um Amen. And so we just want him to just preach as the Lord would lead him. And I wonder if we could just all stand here tonight and and um as we change the order of the service. How many needs the Lord? I I I need him. &gt;&gt; I want more of him. And there's a song, I want more of you. That's the way it's got to be. I need more of you. And that's the way it's got to be. I need more. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Till there's no room left in me. All those wasted hours. &gt;&gt; Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh more. [Music] We've been hearing everything that God's done for us. But just right now say, "Lord, I just want to surrender everything that I am to you. I want to dedicate myself to the cause of Jesus Christ. If you've been so faithful to give it, I want to be faithful to believe it. Give me courage to believe. Lord, give me courage to stand up to the plate as a believer and say, "I'm going to stand against all the odds tonight, and I'm going to believe your word. All those wasted hours and minutes, nothing impossible, they're yours now. From the start to the finish, I need more of you. in me. Yes, I need more of &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For that's the way. [Music] There's no room left in me. [Music] All those wasted hours and minutes, they're yours now. From the start to the finish. I need more of you in me. Oh, how great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our God and all will see how great, how great is our God. How great, how great, oh how great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our God and all will see how great how great is our God. Oh, I like this part right here. He's the name above every name. He's the name above all name. Oh Lord, you're worthy of [Music] [Music] Oh, I don't know what they name the devil, but his name is above every other name. Oh, he's the name above. Oh yes, he's worthy. &gt;&gt; Worthy of our praise. &gt;&gt; And my heart will sing. &gt;&gt; My heart will sing. Oh, how great. Oh, I just want to lift his name one more time. He's the name above every name. Oh, he's the name. Yes, Jesus. Oh Lord, you're worthy of all praise. And my heart will sing. How great is our God. Let's just sing it now. How great. Oh, how great is God. &gt;&gt; Oh, you are great and greatly to be praised, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your name is above every name, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One day all men will see how great you are. [Music] Yes, Lord. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. Can you give the Lord a clap offering tonight? He's the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings. He's worthy of our praise. He's worthy of all that we could give him. There is no other name to be lifted up on high but the name of Jesus Christ. There is no other name by which we can be saved but the name of Jesus. There is no name by which we can be healed, but the name of Jesus. And I believe it should be on everyone's lips in this age. The name of Jesus Christ is what set the captive free. Amen. Amen. It's going to be in the house of the Lord. Such an honor to be here tonight, a part of these services and this meeting. Of course, to be able to stand behind a pulpit like Brother Wendles and just put my shoulder to the wheel with, you know, it's just you, you think as a, you know, growing up in some of these some of these seats as just a young boy looking at some of these heroes, you know, you you see preaching and you think, my, you know, I wish I could do something to help, but then you just let time go on a little bit and and u it's such an honor to just be standing with you, Brother Wendell, and all these brothers and men men of God that are gathered here together. And as we know, we're not here to hear any man, but we're here to hear from the throne of heaven. &gt;&gt; I believe that if we just call on his name, he comes where he's invited. I believe we feel him amongst us. We feel him in the praises of his people. But I wonder just now if you could just have something specific on your heart that you just like to bring before the Lord now. And I believe I believe he's still a discerner. I believe the person of the word is still a discerner. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another Messiah sign or another gift in a man, but we're looking for the word to come &gt;&gt; and discern what we have need of. Just lift that specific need to the Lord tonight. Father, we love you, Lord. We thank you for your word to us, Lord. Your grace that continues to abound, Father. Lord, when we were Lord unworthy, unmmerited, Lord, nobody desired upon us, Lord. Your grace has found us, Lord. Father, and you gave us this word of eternal life, Lord, that we could draw from you, Lord. And Father, be partakers of your cup tonight, Lord. Be partakers of your body, Father. Lord, what an honor it is, Father. Lord, to come and gather, Lord, with so many of like faith that have come with a desire from you, Lord. Lord, knowing that there's no way out of our situation, but less it be by you, Father. And Lord, I pray, Lord, as those needs were, Lord, brought to the mind and brought to the heart of these believers tonight, Lord, you're the God that can fix every situation, Lord. You're the God that can Lord, break loose every chain, every shackle, Father, every fear is defeated in your presence, Lord. For, Father, we've just sung about it. Your name is above every name, Father. Lord, some might call it cancer. Some might call it anxiety. Some might call it fear, Lord. Some might call it unrest, confusion. Lord, whatever the name of it is, Lord, your name is greater than that thing, Father. And Lord, we lift your name up, Father. We lift you high in this place, Lord. We ask that you would take the high place among us, Father. We exalt you, Lord. We, Lord, we cast down our problems. We cast down our opinions, our ideas, Lord, but we exalt your name high and lifted up in this place, Father, for Lord, you're worthy of all we could give. Let every breath, Lord, go to praise you, Father, tonight. Lord, may you just have your way, Father. Thank you for a group of believers that would, Lord, uh, dedicate themselves, Father, that would provide a building, Father. Lord, a Lord, a place we could gather out of the wind and out of the rain. But, Lord, as we heard, we are the tabernacles of your Holy Ghost, Father. And Lord, we thank you that there's tabernacles gathered tonight, Lord, that could come under the shed blood of Jesus Christ, Lord, where we're created equal, Father. Lord, we're all made in your image and in your likeness, Lord. There's not any big ones or little ones among us, Lord, but you are the God of every life in this building, Lord. And Father, we just ask that you would have your way tonight, Lord. Let your word come forth, Father. May you anoint, Lord, the lips to speak it. And may you anoint the ears to receive it tonight, Lord. Father, we we know that we have a great need of you in this hour, Father. Lord, where the world is in turmoil and Lord, where they're tossed to and fro, Lord, you have promised us a direction in this age, Lord, that we could have a straight line followed to to follow, Lord, that we could take it on home into eternity, Lord. That's our desire tonight, Lord. And may it even be so, Father, that Lord, in just these few moments left in this world, that Lord, we would march into that eternal home in complete victory. Father, I pray that you would break chains tonight. Lord, let your word do the work. Father, we pray as we give ourselves to you, Lord, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll turn to the book of Philippians, the fourth chapter. Amen. What can we say about these services so far? &gt;&gt; It's been a real blessing and just a privilege to preach alongside such men of God. and uh you know traveling around some and you know people ask well what calling are you or what what office do you fill and man I always thought of brother Zachary as a as a missionary but today I heard a whole another level of brother Zachary's ministry and my goodness I was just &gt;&gt; I just I look what the Lord has done &gt;&gt; look what the Lord is doing through through his his surrendered vessels. Amen. Amen. Of course, just preaching alongside some buddies and some old buddies and some new buddies. And there's just no greater place than around the carcass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like to read Philippians 4 and we'll just begin at the fourth verse. Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, rejoice. &gt;&gt; Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. And the 19th verse would read, but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Now unto God our father be glory forever and ever. Amen. You could be seated tonight as God could bless his word to us. Like to just take a title out of that context of scripture. Rejoice again. I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we just trust the Lord to help us tonight as I just want to share some of this inspiration I gathered from the word and just did a blessing for me and I felt that maybe it would bless some of us tonight &gt;&gt; that we are rejoicing in the Lord. Amen. Now many of the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers us out of them all. Amen. There's so many things going on in this world. So many indecisions, so many confusions, so many directions being made. And but I believe that that those under the shed blood word in this hour, they have a direction set. There's a light turned on. We're not groping in darkness, but we have a sure destination that we're headed for. And I believe that it's the devil's desire, he cannot stop us from reaching our destination, but he can distract us from looking at where our destination is. And he can distract us to the right and to the left. And though he cannot take away our elect seed, he can sure take away the victory on the way there. But I would like to present the idea tonight that we can go all the way there with victory. We don't have to go ashamedly or burdened down, but we can go all the way there with victory in our voice and victory in our atmosphere and victory in our worship. I believe that God has made a way and the word is more powerful in this age than any oppression that the devil can put on. If you're waiting for the lid of hell to be lifted off, you don't need to wait any longer. But the lid of hell has already lifted off into this age. There's already 200,000,000 demons released into this age. They're already attacking you. So, you're not waiting for a squeeze to come, but the squeeze has already come on the bride. And I say we're still here because greater is he that is in us than he that has come out of hell. And whatever has come out of hell, it could not stop you or it would have done it already. But you're still here because greater is the experience of the message of the hour than those unbelieving spirits that would attack your mind and get you to go to and fro. But he's already come. And I believe I believe if the devil has already come, then Christ has already come as well. We're not waiting for a bride's revival as we heard this morning to come. We're not waiting to be awakened to the to the opening of the word, but we have already entered into the opening of the word. And I believe it's time that we enjoy the blessings of an open word. Let's not be sorrowful and fast and pray wondering if one day he'll come. But he has already come. And when he comes, he comes with healing in his wings. He comes with power and his authority. And I believe Christ has come down this age not that we could be wanting for anything but that our joys might be full. Because what is the point of living under a manifested word if there's no manifestation of it taking place? But I believe it's time to put on the word and manifest the power of God. Now, we know as men, there's no power in us. You could not defeat the devil if it was toe-to-toe with just you and him. But it's not you verse the devil. It's God verse the devil because the one inside of you is the one who already defeated the devil. So therefore, it's not your experience or your testimony that's defeating the devil, but it's that Holy Ghost experience inside of you that has already defeated the devil. And when he looks at you, he can say, "I've seen those eyes before and they have defeated me before." This is a battle that the devil has already lost. and that Holy Ghost experience inside of you will win the victory every time. I don't believe we need to back up. &gt;&gt; I don't believe this is a time as a end time believer that we should retreat or lay low under a rock somewhere. I believe this is a time to press the battle. I believe this is a time to go to war. I I believe that what happens in the natural types of spiritual. And I I noticed the other day that that our president Trump, he changed the name of the Department of Defense. He changed it to the Department of War. And I thought, "Yeah, it's about time for the bride to change from being on the defense to being on the offense. We are not defending anything, but we are men of war. And he has instructed our hands how to war against the devil. We are not defending anything, but this message has already been vindicated, and it has already been proven. And I am not in defense of anything, but I am marching forward in victory because I have been given a token possession that takes me across into the promised land. I believe we ought to exercise our rights in this age. &gt;&gt; I don't believe we ought to back down to what the devil tells you your experience could be. &gt;&gt; What would the devil know about having a victorious experience? He's never had one. &gt;&gt; The devil has never had a real victory. So, how would he know what it feels like to have a victorious experience? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says in second Timothy this, "Know also that in the last days perilous times shall come." &gt;&gt; I believe we're there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Believe you can look around and see that we're in perilous times. &gt;&gt; For men shall be lovers and their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, &gt;&gt; without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good. &gt;&gt; My, are we there or are we not there? traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, &gt;&gt; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof, &gt;&gt; from such turn away. &gt;&gt; For of this sort they have they they which creep into houses and lead captives silly women laden with sins, led away with diverse lust, ever learning, and ever able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now, as Janice and Jambre withtood Moses, so do these also resist the truth. Men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad we don't stop there. There's another verse. &gt;&gt; But they shall proceed no further. &gt;&gt; They shall proceed no further, for their folly shall be made manifest unto all men as theirs also was. Speaking of Janice and Jambas. So just as Janice and Jambas fell to the anointed word of the hour, so will all this list of characteristics fall to the anointed word of the hour, they shall not proceed any further. They shall not succeed in your life. Can I say it like Isaiah said it? No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper. But no weapon, I don't care what it's called. I don't care what you put in. Isaiah 54, we'll just read it. In righteousness shalt thou be established. Now, Brother Zachary covered this this morning. I I thank you for the groundwork. In righteousness of grace shalt thou be established. Thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear from terror, for it shall not come near thee. Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me. Whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. &gt;&gt; You ever think that your enemies have gathered together against you? I believe this prophecy is for you. They shall fall for thy sake. Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work. And I have created the waster to destroy. No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. Somebody say, "No weapon." &gt;&gt; No weapon. &gt;&gt; No weapon. I don't care what you call it. I don't care what spirit of unbelief it is. I don't care what discouragement it is. I don't care what sickness it is. No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper. Thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe those weapons were designed in this age. We're not fighting the same weapons that they fought back there. But there's weapons that the devil has designed for you. But I want to declare to the devil tonight, no weapon that he can make will prosper against the anointed bride in this hour because she is built to be an overcomer. She will not fall to the weapon of unbelief. She will not fall like Eve fell. Eve is not our type. But we are a true bride that will stay with the word no matter what comes, no matter what goes. We are going to stay with the word of God. and no weapon of unbelief shall prosper against me because I was not formed in that way. I was formed before. &gt;&gt; I didn't come after the weapon. I came before the weapon. &gt;&gt; I believe that we're anointed for the challenge of the hour. &gt;&gt; And I believe the message meet end time challenges. Is that right? &gt;&gt; I believe that this is a season that we rise in victory. I don't believe that this is a time to to go down in defeat. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord spoke very clearly to me. I want to preach to you this weekend. &gt;&gt; And I I He told me to come here and tell you this is not a time to go down in defeat, but this is a time to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Again, I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; This is not a time to get discouraged. &gt;&gt; Of course, there's disappointments. Of course, there's defeats. Of course, people are going to leave you. And people are going to forsake you. And your body might be sick. And you might be yelling tonight, but this is not a time to give up. This is a time to g up your loins and rise to the occasion as an overcomer of Leodysia. You knew the battle was going to be hot, but you were built to overcome the battle. You knew that the devil was going to release the best he had. Let me say, Miguel, in this age, the devil has brought his best. But I want to let the devil know, God has also brought his best. And God's best will defeat the devil every time. You are the best that God's got. He didn't just send you into this age just by happen stance, but he sent the best that he had in the back part of his mind as an overcomer in this age. You are the best. &gt;&gt; I am not preaching to a watered down Leodysian bride. I am preaching to the unadulterated, spotless, perfect bride of Jesus Christ. And I came to tell you, you're the best God's got. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] And I believe if God made something to be an overcomer, to be a victor, &gt;&gt; then there is nothing that can come to defeat that purpose. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that can come to supervent the purpose of God. But what God has made is perfect the first time. &gt;&gt; I believe he made us for a position. I believe he made us to carry out his work. I believe the fullness of times has come in this age. &gt;&gt; And while they could not be made perfect without us, I believe we have a position in that. &gt;&gt; I believe we have a part to play. You might think that you're just going to church tonight or you might have come this weekend just to sit in a pew and hear some songs and maybe get some buffet afterwards, but you actually came in the back part of the mind of God. Before there was a trial, there was you. &gt;&gt; Before there was ever a trial of Leodysia, you were already here. You're already wearing what you wear. You already look like what you look like. Because in the mind of God, he was not surprised by 2025. But God has predestinated you. And I don't believe he predestinated you to be an almost made it. I believe he predestinated you to be an overcomer, victorious in every battle. Yes, we're going to we're going to have some defeats and discouragement, but that's not the end of our story. The end of my story is an eternal destination. Everything the devil can put on you is temporary. &gt;&gt; There is nothing permanent. Cuz when the devil ceases to exist and he is he is lost in the lake of fire, I'll still be singing Amazing Grace and glory. When the devil of cancer has been cast into the lake of fire, you will still be shouting the praises of God. The devil is a temporary enemy, but you are an eternal victor. The devil will not win this battle because God has already fought it for you. It's not you versus the devil. It's not your works versus the devil. It's God's perfect sinless son that has already defeated the devil. This is the awakening of the bride. This is what it means to be in the bride's revival. Where is the revival in Ponyie, Oklahoma? It better be on the inside of you. It's not coming one day. We're not waiting for another big preacher or another big meeting. This is the bride's revival in this stage. &gt;&gt; We have recognized the awakening of Christ. &gt;&gt; Not looking for him. &gt;&gt; I know where he is. &gt;&gt; I know he's come down. &gt;&gt; And I know he's brought me into a position. I would like I I would like to just tell the devil his position for a few minutes. &gt;&gt; I believe all weekend we've heard about your position. I know the devil's listening. &gt;&gt; I know he's trying to plague minds and cause, you know, distractions and cause you to think about this. But I want to draw his attention to the word just now. &gt;&gt; I want to tell the devil what his position is. &gt;&gt; I believe if we have one, he also has one. &gt;&gt; And I believe the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified. &gt;&gt; But I believe the hour has also come for the devil to be defeated. &gt;&gt; What side of what side of the victory are you on? Come on. &gt;&gt; Matthew 20 would read like this. Then came to him the mother of Zebed's children with her sons worshiping him and desiring a certain certain thing of him. And he said unto her, "What wilt thou?" She said unto him, "Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdom." But Jesus answered and said, "You know not what you ask. &gt;&gt; Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with?" They said unto him, "We are able." And he said unto him, "Ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, &gt;&gt; but it shall be given to them." &gt;&gt; Somebody say them. &gt;&gt; Them. &gt;&gt; It is prepared of my father. &gt;&gt; So there's somebody coming to fill that position. there's somebody that's going to come and fill that position. Now, this mother of the sons of Zebedee, she knew what she was asking for. She knew where the power laid in his kingdom. She knew exactly by revelation what she was asking for, but he said that position has not has not been given to you. It's been given to those that are prevailed of by my father. Now, she was referring back to Psalms 11:0. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies &gt;&gt; thy foottool. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She knew what she was asking for. The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion, rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. In the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning, thou hast the due of thy youth. &gt;&gt; The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent. Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc. The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. She knew exactly what she was asking for. She was asking for her sons to have a right to have their enemies as their foottool. But what he's telling her is this position to be over the devil has not yet been created. &gt;&gt; It's not mine to give, but it's of my father to them that are coming in the future. In a future day, there are those that can come. Now, this is not just a metaphor of sitting at the right hand of him in heaven, but this is an actual positionally placed believer over the the top of the devil. So, that means whatever the situation is, the devil is under your feet. Now, this could not come until the fullness of the word had come. And Jesus could not jump the cycle of God's plan. But to everything there's a season, and to everything there's a dispensation. He knew that it is not yet time for this to be fulfilled, but at the appointed time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At the appointed time, this position will be given. &gt;&gt; Cuz he knew &gt;&gt; that it was coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luke the 10th chapter. And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing, somebody say nothing. Nothing shall by any means hurt you. My that's enough room to dance right there. That serpents and scorpions. Now, he's not talking about the literal bug and the literal, he's talking about demon anointings, right? In Revelations 9, it would describe these demons, right? As having women uh like hair like women, and they would be scorpions, they would be snakes. And John the Baptist would deal with these things. And brother Brandon would deal the these things in the wilderness. They would look like he's telling you, you have power over every demonic force that is coming and now is. And I believe that they rejoiced in this. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Notwithstanding in this, rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we have a reason to rejoice. The devil would like to tell you that your problem is bigger than the word of God. But the word told me that I have an appointment. My name has already been written on the book of life. And I cannot be defeated. This is not my end. This is not where I cease because I have to fulfill a work. Rejoice that your names are written in heaven. I don't believe that those names were written with an ink pen or a pencil or something you could erase. But before the foundation of the world, when the lamb was slain for the sins that would come forth, his blood was slain. And your name was written there by the lamb's blood. And it cannot be blotted out. Satan doesn't have any racer big enough to blot out the blood of Jesus Christ. But what he wrote, it will last forever and forever. &gt;&gt; I believe we have representation in heaven. I believe we're predestinated to be here this morning or tonight. I believe you just happened here. &gt;&gt; But I believe at the same time your theophony &gt;&gt; I believe the same time that your theophony was in the back part of the mind of God, your representation was done. The battle &gt;&gt; was already over. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know the devil lost this battle before he ever fell from heaven. Lord, &gt;&gt; you know, the devil was already defeated before. If if iniquity would have never been found in Lucifer, you would still be over him. &gt;&gt; You would still be above him. Who has more authority in heaven, an angel or a son of God? Before Lucifer ever was found in iniquity, you were already over the top of him as a son of God. He has no authority over you. He's a fallen angel out of his position and you are a bloodbought redeemed son of God coming back to the fullness of adoption in this age saying ye him. &gt;&gt; You realize that Satan will never have the power to hear ye him. He will never have a voice inside of him of authority. But you have already been given the voice of authority in this age. &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's here. &gt;&gt; I believe we ought to put it to work tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should be defeated. Yes, we have we have circumstances, but you're not defeated. &gt;&gt; You have trials, but you're not giving up. &gt;&gt; You have questions in your mind, but you're still here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Maybe you started out with some folks that aren't here today, but you're still here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Rejoice that your names are written in heaven. It may look like a dark trial, but you can't lose. &gt;&gt; I know this is simple, simple preaching. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it like this. When you become a Christian, you just can't lose. &gt;&gt; I love that quote. I put that on my fridge. I need to see that sometimes because when you become a real believer, it doesn't matter what the devil throws at you, you can't lose. &gt;&gt; You cannot be plucked from my father's hand. He cannot forget about you. For I know the thoughts that I think towards you. They are very specific thoughts. They are named Sam Parker. They are named Judah Martin. They are named Andrew Wheeler. They are very specific thoughts that I think in the back part of my mind. I know the thoughts that I think towards you. And I will not forget my thoughts. But I will give you an expected end. And that expected end is returning back to where we came from. I came from God and I'm going back to God. This is not the end of my story. And the devil would like you to wear all kinds of defeat and discouragement and you just don't understand. Oh yes, I understand. I'm also drudging through Leodysia. But I refuse. I refuse to let the anointing of a fallen angel dictate how I worship my God. I say we praise him when we feel like it and we praise him when we don't. We praise him when the spirit's moving. We praise him when we can't feel it because we are not circumstantial worshippers. But we came from God and we're going back to God. &gt;&gt; We are not just basing our walk on how we feel. &gt;&gt; But we have pre predestinated to overcome 2025. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is no one else that can do what you're doing or God would have sent them. &gt;&gt; But he sent you because you are an overcomer in this age. &gt;&gt; You're not defeated. You're on the winning side. &gt;&gt; Didn't let the devil win. &gt;&gt; You're on the winning side. You got to recognize what side of the battle you're on. Stop identifying yourself with a defeated enemy. You are a risen child of God. &gt;&gt; You've been put here for the purpose of treading on serpents. &gt;&gt; There's no power within me. The devil would have destroyed me. But thanks be to God, he's not fighting me. &gt;&gt; He's fighting one greater than me that I have allowed to come on the inside of me. And when I surrender to him, he says, "Stand still. This is not your battle. For I will fight for you today. And these tormentors that you see today, you will see again no more forever. I am the Lord and I am mighty in battle." Oh, you've seen the Lord. You You seen him heal. You've seen him deliver, but why don't you watch him in battle tonight? Why don't you watch the Lord go to war over your situation? He knows how to fight. &gt;&gt; He's the greatest general that there ever was and ever is. And he's leading the charge tonight in your personal battle. &gt;&gt; This is not a man speaking or a man's idea of this message. This is Christ has come to give you the equipment that you need to overcome every enemy in this age. [Music] I think it's time you recognize. &gt;&gt; Take the ear muffs off. &gt;&gt; Why am I here? &gt;&gt; Why have I been sent here to this age? Brother Windle mentioned that at the beginning of the service. If a man with limited understanding of the gospel &gt;&gt; can give his life for the cause of Christ, how much more are we, the believer in this age that have a fullness of revelation, ought to live our life for the cause of Christ. I believe we ought to be the inspiration in this age, not another voice somewhere. I believe that the bride is the elected voice of this age and there is no other. But God has elected you to carry the mana for this time. It's not putting it off on somebody else. But I say, let the light shine among all men. This message is not something to be ashamed of. I am not ashamed to stand next to William Brandon. I am not ashamed to have a picture of Jesus coming in this age in my home or in my church. &gt;&gt; I believe it's a false anointed one that would try to get you to pull this picture out of the church. This is what makes us different than everybody else. I don't want to go back to denomination. I want to live the message of the hour. I don't want to be Pentecostal. I don't want to be Methodist. I am a message believer. I have been sent here for one purpose, to manifest the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; I believe it's time we become unashamed &gt;&gt; of what we have been chosen to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Zachary laid it out so beautifully this morning with that example in his daughter. &gt;&gt; When somebody elects you, &gt;&gt; they just pick you. &gt;&gt; When somebody picks you, they just pick you. She's the one, &gt;&gt; brother Merl. When you picked her, you just picked her. &gt;&gt; That's the end of the story. Period. &gt;&gt; She's the one. &gt;&gt; Now, imagine if you would pick somebody and then later they would be ashamed to claim you. &gt;&gt; That you would be given divine election of the message of the hour. Let me ask you, what did you do to earn this? &gt;&gt; Brother Dale, what'd you do to get in the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; It was grace, right? We heard it so beautiful this morning. race came down to your situation and imparted to you eternal life. And yet we find so many churches today and so many discouraged believers that are ashamed. &gt;&gt; I believe we should be unashamed. &gt;&gt; I believe that if you are ashamed before men, I'll be ashamed of you at that day. But I say I that is not my scripture. That is not my description. But I will claim to be a message believer with all that is within me. I will not back up on this word. I don't care what kind of distraction, what kind of negativity, what kind of question, what kind of circumstance. I am a message believer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ to me. &gt;&gt; This is why I was put here. &gt;&gt; I was preaching at a friend's a dear pastor friend's uh church in another country. And he said, 'You know, you you preach like that out somewhere and you're all over these these websites that that that are against the message. I said, "Well, praise God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it even harder now. &gt;&gt; You can take what I say and you could broadcast it across the world. I want the message to get out. &gt;&gt; I want to be identified, Brother Matt. They might call us fanatics, but I want to be the right fanatic. I want to be a fanatic for the right team. I don't want to just blend in with denomination and just to be a church member, but I am a son of God adopted in this age and I've been given full authority. And that only comes under the anointing of this message of the hour. You will not get that under TD Jake. You will not get that under under Dr. Dobson. You will not get that under Billy Graham. That only comes by a Melzdc priesthood that has descended in this age. And he has given you authority &gt;&gt; and position. Rejoice. I say again, rejoice. &gt;&gt; You have been given power in this age, not just to tread on serpents, &gt;&gt; but to have a confidence that your name is eternally written in the lamb's book of life, and it cannot be removed. I believe we ought to rise to the occasion. &gt;&gt; Anybody can come to church and fulfill a Leodysian believer. &gt;&gt; Anybody can do that. &gt;&gt; Why are we fighting to stay in Leodysia? Anybody can blend in with Leodysia. &gt;&gt; But that's not the call of this age. &gt;&gt; The call of the age is to come out of her. &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of her. &gt;&gt; Do not blend in. I shouted amen too much this weekend. Do not blend in &gt;&gt; with this age. &gt;&gt; You are in it, but you're not of it. &gt;&gt; There's not a there's not an eighth age coming. You're in this age, but you don't have to be of this age. &gt;&gt; You don't have to act like this age. You don't have to look like this age. &gt;&gt; Anybody, anybody can come to the house of God under a burden and be circumstantial worshipper. Well, bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; I sure wish so and so was preaching today. &gt;&gt; I do too. &gt;&gt; Anybody can do that. &gt;&gt; But it takes a real called out elected believer. &gt;&gt; The covenant that Abraham made or God made with Abraham, it was unconditional. Yes, I think brother Matt mentioned that the other night. unconditional covenant that God made with Abraham. And that means whatever Abraham did, it didn't change the way God felt about him. &gt;&gt; Right? If Abraham messed up or he tripped or he fell, it didn't change the way that God felt about him. And I wonder tonight if we could get some believers in the house of God that will be unconditional believers. Will you be the other side of that covenant with God that no matter what discouragements come, no matter what trials come, no matter what fiery things the devil puts on you, you will praise God anyway. It will not change the way that you feel about God. He will not change the way that you feel about this message. He will not change it because it's unconditional. It's not based on conditions of God. Is if the skies are sunny or the skies are cloudy. No, this walk is unconditional. &gt;&gt; We serve God no matter what comes, no matter what may. The boat might be rocking in the ocean, but I'm going to serve him anyway. &gt;&gt; I was not called for a flowery bed of ease. I was called to a battle. &gt;&gt; And if I was called to battle, it means I am ready for war. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This message has come to resurrect life. If you are hearing this message of the hour, chances are you've already been resurrected. &gt;&gt; You just haven't recognized it yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Resurrection power is not coming. &gt;&gt; Stop notes. I can't read them anymore. &gt;&gt; Lazarus was dead for 4 days. &gt;&gt; And when he came on the scene, he wasn't late, but he got there right on time. And you think, well, if this revival would have come to my home, my children might be still be here, or my church might still be intact. He's never late, but he comes right on time. And he may look like he's 4 days late or 5 years late, but he comes right on time. And when he says, "Lazarus, come forth." It must obey the authority of the word. But that wasn't the end of the story for Lazarus. And you've all heard the shout, "Come out of her. Be not partakers of her." But that's not the end of your story. Cuz Lazarus was still bound hand and foot. There was still a veil over his face. But there was another commission for him. &gt;&gt; This anointing in this age has been sent to loose the bears. &gt;&gt; It has been It has been sent to untie the captive. [Applause] You've been loosed by the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You just need to recognize it. And he shook loose the bands on his feet. And he shook loose the bands on his arms. And he removed the veil as it were over his face. &gt;&gt; So he could see the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; He would have still been in the tomb, but he had to take the napkin off his face that he could behold the glory of the Lord. that this word would be open to him that he would have a reason to rejoice. [Music] &gt;&gt; You've already been resurrected to life. &gt;&gt; Now notice this great moving power of God comes into a son of God. It quickens him. The spirit of life enters into him and that's what it does. It seats them in heavenly places &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; Not they will be. &gt;&gt; We are now. We've already resurrected the dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work, quickened us, and we're quickened up into the presence of God where his spirit is. And now we are seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, sitting in there, the great seat that's already fired up, &gt;&gt; been raised from the dead. We're part of it. If you're part of the bride, you are because the bridegroom is part of the groom. The bride is part of the groom. &gt;&gt; You already been called up to heavenly places. So that means I'm in Leodysia, but I'm not of Leodysia. I'm walking in a Leodysian world in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Because brother said, an adopted son has the authority to speak a world and go live on it. And I believe you've been given the authority where you don't have to be subject to the spirits of this age, but you can speak a word. You can speak a word of a world that you can step into and you can live in the riches of Christ where you're not tossed about by every wind of doctrine, but your eye is on the destination. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There has to be a trial, friend. &gt;&gt; And we're in a battle, &gt;&gt; but there's a reward. You can endure the cause of Christ if you remember. There's a reward. &gt;&gt; If you can remember, there's a victory waiting just over there. And if I could just endure one more day, &gt;&gt; you're already resurrected. You want another quote? I'll give you one. And now, see, now you are already resurrected. When God raised him up, he raised you. &gt;&gt; The sun s o n is just now on you. And now you're growing into a blossom of life like he was to be resurrected completely in that last day. The potential of resurrection power was already in you. &gt;&gt; And because I live, ye shall live also. What a resurrection that was. What a resurrection this is. This is the resurrection of Christ in this age. I don't believe it's a sealed tomb, but the tomb has been opened. And I believe the v victors are marching out because they have been called by name. [Music] &gt;&gt; You recognize this message as eagle food. &gt;&gt; Then you have heard from your theophony. &gt;&gt; A name is a representation or a symbol of an entity. &gt;&gt; It means there's something that represents that name. &gt;&gt; It means that name is on that lamb's book of life, but it actually represents an entity. And when you have heard this message is eagle food. You have heard from your entity. You have heard from an eternal entity that has never been lost, that has never been defeated, that has never tasted a sin. But you had to bypass that so that the redeemer could express his attributes of redemption in your life. That you could sing songs that angels will never sing. They will never be able to sing. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. An empty place. A hopeless case. That was never an angel song. But you had to come down and be redeemed that you could sing the victory song. That you could sing the victory march. And that resurrection power has come down in this age in your life. &gt;&gt; We are not a dead cold formal church. &gt;&gt; You see, the devil would like us to point guns at each other. Hope it's okay, brother Window. Are we okay? &gt;&gt; Like us to point guns at each other in this church and this brother in that church. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's trying to stop the true move of God. &gt;&gt; And what happens is you correct this over here and then you damage this over here. So you've got to preach a balance down the middle of the road and let the word do the correcting. Let the spirit do the correcting that we might maintain a victory in the house of God that we are not ashamed to worship God. Nor are we a we are we a dried up old corpse over here. But we're right in the middle of the road. I believe the devil's trying to put it to the believer. You got to choose one side or the other. No, I'm a middle of the road believer. &gt;&gt; I don't believe the opening of the seals took away our worship. &gt;&gt; I believe it opened true worship. I believe the opening of the word released true worship to us. And I believe it would be perfect order with the word. &gt;&gt; I don't believe you have to choose. I believe the I believe we ought to rejoice in the coming of the son of man and we ought to be able to dance about it. &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to have liberty about it. Who else is going to shout about it? Who else identifies John in Revelations 5 where he shouted because the lamb opened the book to him and revealed his name was on there. You don't have to pick one side or the other. Take it down the middle of the message. &gt;&gt; You would have to throw away 10,000 quotes to make that fit. I say we ought to believe the message. &gt;&gt; I say we ought to believe it in purity. &gt;&gt; The way that God spoke it. The message does not need my idea. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need me to fix it or to tinker with it. Just preach the message. &gt;&gt; The message will correct the error. &gt;&gt; I believe we ought to have something to shout about. And I believe if the word is open to you and the revelation to know that you are not a Pentecostal leodyian, it ought to give us some room to shout. &gt;&gt; Oought to give us some room to rejoice. &gt;&gt; The word has been open to you. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; Again, I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should be tied down to one side or the other. &gt;&gt; Well, this is just me. I hope that's okay. This is what we've been called to do. &gt;&gt; You have been called here and given the power to bind. &gt;&gt; And to loose. &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should have to choose whether we're going to be a, you know, we're going to be the more reserved kind, we're going to be the more fanatical kind. I believe we ought to just be believers. &gt;&gt; I believe you ought to let God work &gt;&gt; in the church. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not a funeral possession. &gt;&gt; Neither is it a frolic. &gt;&gt; It's a feast. A feast with Christ. When the believers come and dine, the master calleth, come and dine. You may feast at Jesus table all the time. He that fed the multitude turned the water into wine. The same Jesus is alive tonight. The hungry call him now. Come and die. We're not feeding on dead carry and brother Sean of a Pentecostal age. We are feeding on the body word son of man that has come down in this dispensation that no other age could put claim to until this age. &gt;&gt; It's your meal. &gt;&gt; He's called you to a banqueting table. His banner over you is love. The capstone of this age is love. And he's called you to come eat at this table. It's a feast. &gt;&gt; So forgive me if I slobber a little bit. I get a little excited. This is a feast with Christ. I didn't come to a funeral. I came to a feast. I came to dine on the master's table. I came to dwell in the word. &gt;&gt; You are what you eat. And &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should be eating some idea of a man or some way a man spins it down to us. I believe we ought to be feasting on the son of man. That's what's come down this age. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; That's who you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; What good does it do to have a bird if he's still in a cage? &gt;&gt; Remember, brother man talks about that zoo in Cincinnati. That eagle was trapped in that cage. &gt;&gt; Did it change what species he was? &gt;&gt; Not at all. &gt;&gt; No, he was still an eagle. &gt;&gt; He was just trapped in a cage. What good does it have the ability to soar in the heavenlies if you're going to stay down here? &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? What good does it do to fight the devil on his ground? &gt;&gt; Why would we stay down here in three dimensions? &gt;&gt; When we've been given access to rise above whatever the devil can throw at us. It's your decision if you want to stay down here and fight with the devil. But as for me, I've heard a call to come up higher. Good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "What good's your faith going to do if you can't turn it loose?" &gt;&gt; What good is it going to do you if you don't use it? We could talk about the message. &gt;&gt; Sure, we can quote. We can exchange scriptures and quotes and you can, you know, say, "Well, you missed this quote here and you missed that quote there. We can exchange that." But what good does it do to talk about it? &gt;&gt; What good does it do to play a tape every Sunday if you're not going to put it into action? &gt;&gt; I wish I got to pick a tape for them. I' I'd say put faith and action in. Let's listen to that one. What good does it do to sit on your couch? Anyways, I don't know what we got here. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to bring it on closer to us. &gt;&gt; What good does it do to come into this this church every Sunday and on a Wednesday night and expect God to come down with a supernatural blessing for you and you won't pour out anything for him? [Music] &gt;&gt; It's simple business mechanics, investments. You expect God to do something for you, but you won't do anything for him. &gt;&gt; And you think your sacrifice isn't worth anything because you're unworthy. News flash, God knows you're unworthy. He knows every mistake you've ever made. He knows every trial that you failed. He knows every battle that you've lost. But yet, he's still seeking. &gt;&gt; God is actively looking for those who will worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; I say look no further than right here, Lord. Yes. Yes, I'm unworthy. Yes, I made mistakes. But I will worship you. I will worship you ahead of the victory. I will worship you ahead of the dance. I will worship you ahead of the healing. I will worship you before I can see the next corner because I will worship you in the spirit and in the truth. &gt;&gt; Look no further than right here. Where is the Welsh revival? &gt;&gt; There is a worshipper who will worship him in spirit and in truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're preaching fanaticism. Well, maybe I am. &gt;&gt; No wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day. No wonder the sun hid its face and screamed for joy. No wonder all nature broke loose. The wind shook the trees and they shook and joyed and jumped. They seen the prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem every name in the book of life. We're not fanatics just cuz we feel like it. But I see my name. When I was unredeemable, I saw my name. That's why I rejoice. That's why I shout cuz my name has been revealed. That's why the mountains cried. Cuz they saw their name. Where were you, Job? When I laid the foundations, I was there. You ever ask yourself why they were shouting? Because they saw the plan of redemption coming in full view. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be lost for a season, but my redeemer's coming for me. &gt;&gt; I was there when they shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; So what are you then? You're a morning star, sir. No wonder all nature broke loose. &gt;&gt; And they seen that their own nature was redeemed. &gt;&gt; They screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake and the mountains ran and the rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything taken place. Like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you that is finished. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching this out of my emotion. I have authority to preach this by the message of the hour. like any med meeting will be when the Lord reveals to you, &gt;&gt; it's finished. &gt;&gt; I've seen jumping spells. I've seen joy spells, but there was nobody hurt. The mountains rung out and the sun went down and everything took place, but there was nobody hurt. And I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world, &gt;&gt; and the joy of the Lord filled the congregation. [Applause] They stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I never did see anything disorderly. They was always right in order because they had recognized that their name that had been written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; The great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not a message of arguments. This is not a message of squables. This is a message of deliverance. This is a message of freedom. This is a message of victory. This is a message of loosing. &gt;&gt; Because they had recognized the authority of the message. No man has ever healed anybody in his life but the message Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never looked into anybody's life but the Christ in him. &gt;&gt; Come on friends. We don't baptize in the name William Brandon. where we baptize the name of Paul. There's only one name that could bring a message like this. It must have been Jesus. Only could it be him? It couldn't be anybody else. But it had to be Jesus. &gt;&gt; This message is Christ. &gt;&gt; How could we be ashamed of Christ? &gt;&gt; How could we say, "Well, we just believe this, we believe that." No, we believe Christ. I believe Christ has descended with a shout in this age. And I believe he has released an anointing to the people of God where we are not supposed to look like Leodysian church members. &gt;&gt; But we've heard a shout. &gt;&gt; There's something in the hearing of this word. &gt;&gt; Hearing &gt;&gt; produces faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing of the word of God. And how could they hear less there be a preacher? There's &gt;&gt; something in the hearing. &gt;&gt; Brother man would tell us earlier in his ministry about about the way the deaf and dumb spirits work. &gt;&gt; He said that that spirit would attach itself &gt;&gt; around the hearing nerve &gt;&gt; and it would clamp down on it. &gt;&gt; It would constrict it. &gt;&gt; It would drive out the life from the nerve. Right? And as long as that spirit was there, there would never be life in that nerve. Come on. &gt;&gt; But rejoice friends. &gt;&gt; Brother said it was like a transparent band &gt;&gt; that came down around that that that that hearing nerve, right? &gt;&gt; And it would clamp down on it and then you wouldn't be able to hear. &gt;&gt; And I wonder sometimes if some of us sit in service after service and there's some spirit clamping down on our hearing. And if you identify with that, I've got a solution for you. &gt;&gt; That's not the end of your story. &gt;&gt; But there's a victory promised in this age. That every band will be loosed by the preaching of the message and every spirit will be subject under your feet. You remember I wanted to tell the devil what his position is. It's my foottool. is underneath my foot because I have been given power to tread on serpents and snakes and any other demon power in this age. And I've also been given the power to stand on unbelief and put it beneath my feet and say you will not get me. But I have been given power over you. Before you ever were, I was. And when you will cease, I will be. And when you take your last breath, I'll just be on round 10,000 of Amazing Grace. I'll sweep the sound that saved a wretch like me and loose the bands over my life. &gt;&gt; This message is lie, friends. &gt;&gt; Brother said, he said, "I was a critic &gt;&gt; other than people dancing and shouting." &gt;&gt; He said, "I didn't have enough victory. He said, "I was critical of those people because they had the victory." &gt;&gt; Now, why are we rejoicing? &gt;&gt; There's no music playing right now. &gt;&gt; There ain't no drums beating right now. &gt;&gt; This is stimulation by revelation of your of your name revealed on the lamb's book of life. and that you cannot lose, you cannot be removed, but you will always be in his hand, in the right hand of his power. In fact, you will always be going to see you. &gt;&gt; But there's a reward. &gt;&gt; We're doing okay. &gt;&gt; He that has an ear, &gt;&gt; let him hear what the spirit says to the church. &gt;&gt; You got to have your hearing unlocked. &gt;&gt; Well, this is just this is just how I'm going to live my life. I'm always going to be this way. I'm always going to have this complex. I'm always going to have anxiety. I'm always going to have this sugar diabetes. I'm always gonna have this fear in my life. I'm always going to have crowd anxiety where I can't even enjoy a service and I can't even get in the glories of God because everybody's shouting and it makes me nervous. And you think that's the end of your story, but that's not the end of your story. &gt;&gt; But there's a solution for you. &gt;&gt; There's an opening of your ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the church. And the spirit is not saying to stay down there in your condition or stay down there in your circumstance or in your pain. You know, I want to say this to the church today. Never let the voice of your pain become louder than the voice of your worship. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. Never let the voice of your discouragement become louder than the voice of your worship. Come on. &gt;&gt; Never let the voice of the devil putting it on you become louder than the voice of your worship. Let the voice of your praise be louder than the circumstances that you're facing today. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil win that. Don't let him steer your truck. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's going to attack you. But you have a choice to make. You can go down and the woe is me or you can come up and the praise my God. &gt;&gt; Like what brother Matt said, you may not feel it, but can you see it? &gt;&gt; You going to praise him in advance. &gt;&gt; Oh, anybody can praise him after, &gt;&gt; but it takes a real warrior &gt;&gt; to praise him in advance of the victory. You've got to know. You've got to have a relationship that though he slay me, yet I'll trust him. Though he put me down, yet I'll serve him. Though I don't get everything I want and everything I ask for, yet I'll give him all my praise. Though I don't feel good, though my body's aching. Though cancer's riddled my body, I'm going to give him praise anyway. Because that is the purpose that I was sent to this age for. Not to give the devil praise, but to give my God praise. Don't use your voice to praise the wrong entity, but recognize that your praise is not circumstantial. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And it comes in hard trials. &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord loves it more than anything &gt;&gt; when you can praise him through a trial. It's a sweet savior in his nostrils. &gt;&gt; You want to do something for the Lord? Praise him in the middle of your circumstance. &gt;&gt; He that has an ear. There's a reward for overcomers. Press on, lily, if it's in you, lay lay aside the mud and everything else and press towards the top to sit with me on my throne. You know, one time the mother of James and John, the mother of James and John came and asked for this place. You know that &gt;&gt; let my son on the one side and my mother said on the other on the other there's the mother's desire for her son. But watch that place Jesus said was predestinated. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in predestination, you're probably uncomfortable. But I believe what the prophet taught. &gt;&gt; That place was predestinated. This position was not in existence at that time. But it will be granted to them and who it is meant for. &gt;&gt; The one to sit at the right hand and the other closest to him was yet an overcomer. See, he said, "I don't grant this. I can't grant this, but it will be given after the trial comes." I can't give this, but after the trial comes, they'll set on the right hand and on the left. There's a predestinated seed waiting out yonder for that, and it will be given to the ones that it's promised to. It will be given there. But the test hasn't come yet. He hasn't overcome yet. See, the person was to take this place on the side and on the other and take it on the other side next to him in the kingdom. It wasn't yet given. &gt;&gt; Hadn't overcome. &gt;&gt; The test hadn't fell yet, but it will fall in the future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've been positionally placed &gt;&gt; by the message. in the hand of power. &gt;&gt; You take that back to Psalms 110, which we read, "Now your enemy is your foottool." So the position that she was asking for for her sons to have power over every spirit could not be given to them because it was safe for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wish I could get it out. &gt;&gt; You ever been somewhere and you're sitting down, somebody says, "Is anybody sitting there?" &gt;&gt; "No, I got it saved. got save for my wife. &gt;&gt; You can't sit there. Oh, there's nobody sitting there now. Yeah, but you can't sit there. &gt;&gt; It's been reserved. &gt;&gt; It's a saved position. &gt;&gt; That's been reserved for such a time as this when the sons and daughters of God come into the fullness of adoption. That's why I don't understand why you would try to run away from adoption. It's what gives us authority in this age to overcome every spirit of Leodysia. If you're going to turn the corner in the word, you've got to be under adoption or we're just a bunch of Holy Ghost shouting Pentecostals. But we have been given a message in this age that has placed us over the enemy. You are not subject to whatever the enemy throws at you, but you are an anointed adopted joint heir with Christ. &gt;&gt; Every right that he has, you also have. As I overcame the world, you will also overcome the world. And because I live, you will also live. Resurrection power has come back to the church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to recognize what dispensation and season we're in. We're not in the season of Leona and Fodder. We are in a bride's revival, in a bride's age. You got to rise up to the occasion and take flight. And there's enough rocket fuel in this message that it'll take you so far past the moon. &gt;&gt; Mount up with wings, eagles. &gt;&gt; It's time to soar. I believe it's time to recognize the age and the dispensation that we're living in &gt;&gt; after Jesus. I'm not going to preach to you all night. We're going to have a prayer line here in a minute. &gt;&gt; And you might think this interesting text for a prayer line. Well, I want you to approach it different than you've ever approached one. &gt;&gt; I want you to approach it with authority &gt;&gt; to know the ground that you stand on. &gt;&gt; You're not a beggar. You're a son. That's right. &gt;&gt; To recognize the season and the dispensation that you're in. Jesus comes out of the wilderness after being tempted by the spirit of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Who are you anyway? If thou be a son, if you are a daughter, if you are a real believer, &gt;&gt; after coming down off the mountain, he walks right into the synagogue. He opens up the scripture and he reads Isaiah 61. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me. Because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives. &gt;&gt; And the opening of the prison to them that are bound &gt;&gt; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. and then closes the book. &gt;&gt; And that's the end of our story. &gt;&gt; No, there's more to the story. &gt;&gt; There's You mean there's another corner to turn &gt;&gt; after God sent a prophet? &gt;&gt; You mean there's another corner to turn &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost experience? &gt;&gt; You mean there's another corner to turn? There's a deeper water to wait in. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. I'm so glad you asked. Thank you for asking. Yes, there's another corner to turn. &gt;&gt; And so he identifies this day, this scripture is fulfilled in your ears &gt;&gt; to proclaim liberty to the captive. And what he did in his first coming, he must magnify in his second coming. &gt;&gt; So we see the book closed in his hand. But then when we find it again in Revelations, it's not a closed book, Zachary. &gt;&gt; It's an open book. And he he finishes the rest of the verse &gt;&gt; and he says, "And the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified." You know what that word vengeance means? &gt;&gt; It comes from the Latin vindicati, which means to be vindicated &gt;&gt; in the day of his vindication. &gt;&gt; Now, what season are you in? You could say, "Well, brother, you're preaching a mighty strong position for the bride in this age, but I know where I'm getting it from. &gt;&gt; I didn't put you there. He put you there. I couldn't put myself there. He put me there &gt;&gt; in the day of his vindication. This word vindication means to free from allegation or blame, &gt;&gt; to confirm. &gt;&gt; To provide justification or defense for, to justify, to set free, to deliver, to loose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the day of vindication, the church, the bride has been loosed. They are not bound down by chains of circumstance. They are not bound down by chains of what the devil puts on them. But you are living in the day of vindication when all the bride is loosed under the anointing of the hour. You have been loosed. And you know what the word loose there means? It means a call to come higher. You've got to take the band off your hearing. If you're still in Revelations 3, you've got to hear Revelations 4. You've got to hear a voice shout to you. Come up higher. And I looked and there was a door. You could choose to stay on the outside or you could choose to walk through the door. But I have heard my name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And yes, the enemies of Leodysia are all around us. But you know, you have been elected to be anointed in the presence of your enemies. &gt;&gt; You know what it means to be anointed in the presence of your enemy? He doesn't know a somber thing. It means victory struck in the middle of the battle. It means that you got a revelation that you are victorious through Christ who strengthens you in the middle of your battle. You know what I like the devil to see? I like when he puts it on me and he puts the battle high to me. And I like to dance right in front of him. I like him to know that you will not control me. You will not tell me how I can worship. You will not dictate to me how I serve my God. that I have been given authority over you and every circumstance of this age. I have been anointed in the presence of my enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I have been anointed &gt;&gt; in the middle of Leodysia. A call to come higher &gt;&gt; loose from it. And it's Acts the 16th chapter. Paul and Silas would be going down the road performing acts of the apostles. They run into a woman possessed with a spirit of divination. Right? &gt;&gt; That's what would get them in prison ultimately, right? What did he do? Because he took he took the money maker out of denomination. &gt;&gt; You know what that word Divination means in the scripture, you take that to the strongest concordance, it means a python, something that constricts, something that chokes the life out of you. You know, tonight you've been given power &gt;&gt; to tread on serpents. You've been loosed by the message anointing in this hour. That there is no spirit that can hold you down, no spirit that can bind you. But by the liberty of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you have been given a clear pathway to freedom. &gt;&gt; This is an age for hearing and understanding. I was in Mexico last year with brother Diego and we had a prayer line like we're going to have here in a minute and the anointing of God came through there and brother Wendle and older sister came through there was actually the pastor's mother-in-law came through there and and and I met her before when we were there once and she's a she's deaf. She's been deaf since she was six years old. She got some kind of fever uh when she was a child and it actually burst the the the the bones that make up the eardrums in your ear and there was no way for her to ever have hearing. And now here she is 78 years old &gt;&gt; and she comes through this prayer line and the Lord heals her instantly. &gt;&gt; Total miracle heals her instantly. &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, I wondered I kind of scratched my head. I said, "Lord, why would you heal this sister in her 70s? She lived her whole life like this and now she makes it what might look like the end of her of her road and you bring healing to her ears. And as clear as I'm talking to you right now, brother Ben, the Lord spoke to me and said, "There's never been a better time to hear the message than right now." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, there's never been a better time to unlock your ears than right now. You might have had some python preached on you by some false anointed preacher that told you that you can never rise to the occasion that told you that you would never be the the pride of Jesus Christ that told you you'd always have to live in the slop of Leodysa. But there's never been a better time to take the binders off your ears and hear the liberated word of God that has loosed the captive in this age. It's not coming. The loosening has already come. The victory is not coming. The victory has already come. This word has loosed the captive. It has broken the binds. It has loosed the bands off of your life. Now, I believe it's time to change our clothes. Even Lazarus had to come out of that grave. And you know what? They said he stinks because religion stinks in God's nostrils. Vain worship stinks in God's nostrils. But I believe there was another commission. I believe he said change his clothes. Take off his grave clothes and put on the garment of praise. Your destination is not the grave. Your destination is victory. Your destination is not bowing down to some sickness or some spirit. Your destination is at the right hand of power to sit on the throne. Hallelujah. I'm preaching some overcomers tonight to know they are positionally placed in the body of Christ that we are risen up with him. &gt;&gt; Let the music players come. &gt;&gt; You have been positionally placed at the right hand of power. &gt;&gt; You know what that word, you know what it means? A foottool. &gt;&gt; It means something to trample on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That means the devil sent his best and you know what you did? &gt;&gt; You trampled on it. &gt;&gt; You've been Did you know he saved that spot? That's brother Windle seat. That's where he was sitting. &gt;&gt; Saved it for him. &gt;&gt; At the right time, in the right season, &gt;&gt; you would come to your right position. And he's been saving that for you before the foundation of the world. Before there ever was a devil, before there ever was an enemy, before there ever was a sickness plague in your body, before there was ever a false teacher that ever rose on the earth, he was saving a perfect spot for you that you might walk into the fullness of your position. &gt;&gt; I believe the hour has come. I &gt;&gt; believe the time has come for the bride, but I believe the time has also come for the devil &gt;&gt; I believe it's time for the devil to be defeated &gt;&gt; once and for all in your situation &gt;&gt; because you don't have to deal with what the devil gave you. &gt;&gt; I want to proclaim to you by a vindicated prophet's words, your future is clear. The doctors told him, "You'll have those parasites your whole life." And the devil might have told you, you'll carry that your entire life. You'll carry that regret and that condemnation, those family traits, &gt;&gt; that family cycle that you're burdened under, that unstable mind, you'll carry that your whole life. He said he would carry parasites his whole life. &gt;&gt; But the Lord came down and told him, "Your future, &gt;&gt; I want to tell you today, bride your future's clear. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; just as soon as that anointing said that, he said it was like sheets of paper with writing on them, just paved the way for me. I want you to come down and walk in this line in a few minutes and I want you to know your future is clear. You're walking on paper that's already got your name on it. You just walk in the line that God has made for you and it will level you up. He said it leveled him up. And as he walked knowing with the confidence that his future was clear, that the devil will not win this battle because you have already been anointed to be king. You have an appointment to make &gt;&gt; and you can't miss it. &gt;&gt; You just can't miss it. &gt;&gt; You're not going to miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; You can't miss it. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; What are these great mysteries? It's you. The seventh seal has been opened. In you &gt;&gt; will I ever attain the stature of a perfect man. It's the word in you. &gt;&gt; The stature of the fullness of Christ. Your future's clear. There's nothing I can do to merit this. &gt;&gt; I just need to accept it. &gt;&gt; I just need to accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Graham said, "It doesn't take what we would think a great thing. It only takes a hand that's completely anointed with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; with God's power to strike down any enemy under any circumstance. Tonight, by the word of the Lord, these men of God are going to lay their hands on you by the same commission that Jesus spoke over Lazarus to say, "Loose him &gt;&gt; and let him go." I want you to come to this prayer line with authority to know that you have been given power over serpents, over scorpions, &gt;&gt; over every demonic power in this age. But even more than that, I want you to know that your road is clear because your name has been revealed in the Lamb's book of life and the devil doesn't have access to stop you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What you got, brother Kobe? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; No battle tomorrow. [Music] I will praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will praise the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; I will praise the Lord. No matter what mar [Music] I will praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And man I believe I believe that one time in the scripture there was a tormentor that like to torment the children of God. He lived his whole life that he would torment them. I believe that the devil has tormented you for years and years and your whole life. But I believe you were born for such a time as this. That I believe that even what the enemy has meant for evil, God will work it for your good. And no weapon, no gallows built to hang you will prosper. No weapon formed against you will prosper. But you were born for such a time as this. Not a time of defeat, but a time of victory. A time of healing. A time for deliverance. A time for resurrected life. A time to come out of dead works and dead traditions. A time to come out of just being a lukewarm leodyian wishy-washy church member. But a time to rise up on eagle's wings as a real believer in this age. You were born for such a time as this. And I believe they have a feast in their in their country called the feast of Purum. And they write that name of Hmon on the bottom of their shoe. And every time they think about or mention the name of Hmon, they do a little dance. Well, I want you tonight to write on the bottom of your shoe something that you're going to claim here in this prayer line. And I want you to recognize that you are treading in your position over the top. You might be the weakest Christian in this building. You might be the bottom of the skin of the foot, but you are still over the devil. You are still in your position. You might be the doormat in the house of the Lord, but you are still over the greatest principalities of the air of this demonic kingdom that we live in. You have been given dominion rights as an adopted child of God to tread on serpents. I don't know what everyone has need of, and I couldn't fix it, but I know a God that knows every single individual need in this building, and he is more than able to supply. So why don't you take him at his word tonight and recognize you've been anointed for such a time as this that you might overthrow the devil's kingdom in your life and say devil you've had your way with me all these years all these times through this whole trial but tonight &gt;&gt; tonight I am rising up to my position &gt;&gt; my future's clear devil your future has a certain end you will die in the lake of fire you will cease to torment people and my future is clear to walk in into the kingdom of God where I can hear the words, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. Enter into your reward." There's a position that I have made for you. I have prepared it for you. Enter into your blessing tonight. &gt;&gt; Why don't you enter into your Hallelujah? Oh, I will praise the Lord. No, no matter what tomorrow brings, what it has store, I will praise the Lord. Oh, I will praise the Lord. I love you, Jesus. I will praise the Lord. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, as we prepare tonight for the prayer line, &gt;&gt; we're going to have you brothers, I would like to have you ministering brothers to to line up first.
