[37:07] Doctrine and so um so we're going to
[37:11] we're going to be dealing a little bit
[37:13] in that and um um brother Brenham goes
[37:18] through some um through some church
[37:20] history and so and again um if there is
[37:23] anything that if we have questions or
[37:27] you know you know cuz some of this can
[37:28] be a a little
[37:31] um you know when you get into some of
[37:33] this history and there's going to be a
[37:35] lot of names and this and that uh you
[37:37] know raise your hand if you if if you if
[37:39] you have have a question um but before
[37:43] we we get into the church age book um
[37:46] you know brother brother brandham had
[37:49] made the
[37:50] statement and and it's a it's a a pretty
[37:53] pretty strong pretty strong statement
[37:57] and so
[37:58] um there in in Revelation chapter 4 he's
[38:02] um he deals with this he says now my
[38:04] precious brother I know this is a tape
[38:06] also now don't get excited let me say
[38:10] this with Godly love the hour has
[38:12] approached where I can't hold still on
[38:14] these things no more too close to the
[38:17] coming see trinitarian trinitarianism is
[38:22] of the devil I say that thus saith the
[38:26] Lord
[38:29] now um you know he would go on and it
[38:32] says look where it came from it it come
[38:34] from the Nan Council when the Catholic
[38:37] Church be in rulership the the word
[38:40] Trinity is not even mentioned in the
[38:43] entire book of the Bible and as far as
[38:46] three Gods that's from Hell there's one
[38:48] God that's exactly right now do you say
[38:52] then do you believe that all these
[38:54] people that are trinitarians are of hell
[38:57] no I believe they are Christians but the
[38:59] hour is approaching brother where they
[39:02] are sincerely wrong any man anywhere
[39:05] anytime that wants to talk on the
[39:06] subject come to me any Minister Bishop
[39:10] Archbishop uh whatever you may be this
[39:12] is tap we'll go around the world and I
[39:15] ask in brotherly love for any person
[39:17] that hears me on this tape around the
[39:19] world that will come to me and show me
[39:21] one text of scripture or one paragraph
[39:23] of any history that's authentic history
[39:26] where any person was ever B AP ized in
[39:27] the name of the father Son and Holy
[39:29] Ghost until they origined or organized
[39:33] in the Catholic church now so we we want
[39:38] to um
[39:40] uh so this is how strong that brother
[39:43] brandham felt about it now before we um
[39:47] let's I told you 181 or 180 but let's go
[39:51] let's let's look here at page 308 just
[39:54] real
[39:55] quickly and this is a dealing with a a
[39:58] dream that brother brandham
[40:01] had and
[40:05] um let's see let's do it let's start at
[40:08] 307 and the uh the last paragraph
[40:12] there it says now then we can see that
[40:14] Jesus is the door he is the door of the
[40:16] sheep and notice that it speaks now of
[40:19] the door
[40:21] opening and what is that but a
[40:24] revelation of
[40:25] him and that re Revelation is opening up
[40:28] to bring us strength to illuminate the
[40:31] word and glorify his name it was in the
[40:35] midst of the last two ages that the
[40:37] revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ
[40:40] blossomed out before us yes we knew he
[40:44] was God how how else could he be our
[40:48] savior but to know that he ought that he
[40:51] was only God or God Alone that he was
[40:55] the Alpha and Omega
[40:57] that this Jesus was both Lord and Christ
[41:01] making him Lord Jesus Christ the Father
[41:04] the Son and the Holy Ghost all one
[41:08] person that had been lost since the
[41:11] first church
[41:12] ages but now we are seeing it again the
[41:15] revelation of who he was had come back
[41:19] indeed the godhead is not threers a
[41:22] three-person god with one personality
[41:25] for it takes a personality to make a
[41:27] person person if there is one
[41:29] personality there is but one person but
[41:32] they who
[41:33] believe in three
[41:36] persons uh have a three good godhead and
[41:39] are guilty of breaking the first
[41:41] commandment but the revelation of the
[41:43] godhead is back now the true church can
[41:47] build in strength again now there's a
[41:50] reason he says that the true church can
[41:53] build in strength
[41:55] again and and he's fixing give us a
[41:58] dream he says after all this time she
[42:01] finally knows who her Lord is once again
[42:04] we are baptizing in the name of the Lord
[42:06] Jesus just as they did at Pentecost let
[42:09] me tell you of a god-given dream I had
[42:12] about the Triune
[42:14] baptism this was not a vision but a
[42:16] dream and you know I am I am sure that
[42:19] one of the blessings of the church Ages
[42:21] was to receive Dreams by the Holy Ghost
[42:24] just the same as one can receive visions
[42:27] it was about 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday
[42:29] morning I had gotten up to get Joseph a
[42:32] drink of water and when I lay down I
[42:35] fell asleep instantly and dreamed this
[42:38] dream I saw a man that I that I supposed
[42:42] was my father he was a great big Burly
[42:45] man I also saw a woman who was supposed
[42:47] to be my mother but she didn't look like
[42:50] her even as the man didn't look at like
[42:53] my father this man was very mean to his
[42:56] wife he had a large club with three
[42:58] corners on it you know when you take a a
[43:02] log and set it on in and and hit it with
[43:05] an axe and it makes three cornered wedge
[43:08] likee piece of
[43:10] firewood uh it was like that and he
[43:13] would take this club and hit her with it
[43:16] and knock her down and he would lie
[43:18] there or she would lie there crying and
[43:21] he would walk around with his chest
[43:23] stuck out and on his facei was such a a
[43:26] proud boastful look that he appeared to
[43:28] take pride and satisfaction in beating
[43:31] up a poor little woman every time she
[43:34] tried to get up he would hit her he did
[43:37] not like uh I did not like what he was
[43:39] doing but I considered stop as I
[43:42] considered stopping him I thought I
[43:44] can't tackle that man he's too big and
[43:47] then he's supposed to be my father but
[43:49] down inside I knew he wasn't my father I
[43:52] knew that no man have the right to be to
[43:55] treat a woman like that I went over and
[43:57] grabbed him by the collar and turned him
[43:59] around and said you have no right to
[44:01] strike her and when I said that my
[44:04] muscles grew and I looked like a giant
[44:07] and the man saw them and then he was
[44:10] scared of me and I said you strike her
[44:12] again and you'll deal with me he
[44:15] hesitated to strike her again and then
[44:17] the dream left me I awoke immediately
[44:21] after the dream and I thought how
[44:23] strange this was and I wondered why I
[44:26] had dreamed about that woman when
[44:27] suddenly there he came the presence of
[44:30] God came uh became known to me and the
[44:34] interpretation of the Dream came from
[44:37] him now you people know that not only
[44:40] have I interpreted your dreams exactly
[44:43] but I have many many times told you what
[44:46] you dream so that you never had to tell
[44:48] me the woman represents the Church of
[44:52] the world today I was born right into
[44:55] this mess the mess that she is in she
[44:58] was supposed to be a kind of mother and
[45:01] she is the mother of harlots and her
[45:03] husband is the denominations that rule
[45:06] her and she Corner uh the three cornered
[45:09] block is a tri false Triune baptism unto
[45:12] a trinity every time she started to rise
[45:15] up that means the congregation begin to
[45:17] accept truth he would drive her right
[45:19] back again with a false Doctrine and he
[45:22] was so big that I was afraid of him at
[45:24] first but when I came against him found
[45:27] that I had great powerful muscles they
[45:29] were Faith muscles the outcome of the
[45:32] dream was that since God is with me and
[45:35] can give me such strength then let me
[45:38] stand up for her against the
[45:39] denominational power of the world and
[45:42] make him uh quit striking her now I am
[45:46] not trying to build a Doctrine Upon A
[45:48] Dream nor am I trying to vindicate any
[45:50] Doctrine I stand for by a dream Oneness
[45:53] of the godhead is all the way from
[45:56] Genesis 1:1 1 to Revelations
[45:59] 22:21 but the people have been blinded
[46:02] by an unscriptural dogma of a trinity
[46:06] and that Dogma is universally accepted
[46:09] that to try to see a one God person is
[46:12] all but
[46:13] impossible if people can't see the truth
[46:16] and this is where I want you to
[46:18] understand as I as I had had uh told you
[46:21] all ago when we were reading and um um
[46:26] that that where I said the true church
[46:28] can build in strength again now and we'd
[46:32] read that there at the top of the 308
[46:34] now this is this is where you're going
[46:36] to get your strength if people can't see
[46:39] the truth of the godhead but fight but
[46:42] fight it they can't ever see the rest of
[46:45] the truth because the revelation of
[46:49] Jesus Christ in his church and his works
[46:53] in the midst of the church for The Seven
[46:56] Ages did you get that now I'm sure you
[47:00] understand so if you can't catch the
[47:03] mystery of the godhead and you're you're
[47:06] trying to make God three then you'll
[47:08] never truly catch the revelation of what
[47:12] God has intended all along God above us
[47:17] God in Jesus and now God in us if you
[47:22] try to make them three you're missing
[47:25] the point it's good God condenscending
[47:28] God coming down and living in human
[47:32] beings amen and that's that's that's the
[47:35] whole plan of God not to not to mystify
[47:39] God in any way but to and and and you're
[47:42] going to find out as we read tonight
[47:44] that that what Satan has done through
[47:47] the Trinity is to divert the godhead
[47:51] from living in you and me it's it's to
[47:55] it's to it's to get our attention on
[47:58] that Holy away from that holy God living
[48:01] in people Satan wants to make it a
[48:03] religion and and that's that's not the
[48:06] way God's intention is now let's go to
[48:08] let's go to page
[48:11] 181 and um and and we'll start to read
[48:15] there praise the
[48:21] Lord when you're there you can say
[48:24] Amen all right am man so we're going to
[48:28] read uh
[48:29] 181 and we're going to start at the
[48:31] second verse or the second
[48:33] paragraph uh pergamus Satan's throne and
[48:37] dwelling place to many these phrases
[48:41] have have been merily uh pictorial
[48:44] rather than truly
[48:46] historical but they are surely real and
[48:49] history bears that out pergamus was
[48:52] indeed the throne and Dwelling Place of
[48:54] Satan and it happened on this wise
[48:58] pergamus was not originally the place
[49:01] where Satan as concerning human Affairs
[49:04] dwelt Babylon has always been literally
[49:08] and figuratively his headquarters it was
[49:11] in the city of Babylon that the satanic
[49:14] worship uh had its origin he Genesis 108
[49:20] through1 and Kush begat Nimrod and he
[49:24] began to be a mighty one in the Earth he
[49:27] was a mighty Hunter before the Lord and
[49:29] the beginning of his kingdom was Babel
[49:32] Eric and aad and uh canb or Kaa and in
[49:38] the land of Shar and then in Genesis 11
[49:41] 1-9 it says the whole earth was of one
[49:44] language and of one speech and it came
[49:47] to pass as they journeyed from the East
[49:49] that they found a plane in the land of
[49:52] Shar and they dwelt there and they said
[49:56] one to another
[49:57] go too let us make brick and burn them
[49:59] thoroughly and they had brick for stone
[50:01] and slime had they for Mortar and they
[50:05] said go too let us build a city and a
[50:07] tower whose top May reach unto heaven
[50:12] and let us make a name and lest we be
[50:15] scattered abroad upon the face of the
[50:17] whole earth and the Lord came down to
[50:19] see the city and the tower which the
[50:21] children of men builded and the Lord
[50:24] said behold the people is one
[50:28] uh and they had have one language and
[50:31] this they begin to do and now nothing
[50:34] will be retained from them which they
[50:36] have imagined to do go to and let us go
[50:40] down and their confound their language
[50:44] that they may not understand one
[50:46] another's speech so the Lord scattered
[50:49] them abroad from thence upon the face of
[50:51] the Earth and they left off building uh
[50:54] left off to build the city
[50:57] therefore is the name of it called Babel
[51:00] so there's where there's where Babylon
[51:02] came from and because the Lord did there
[51:05] confound the language of all the Earth
[51:08] and from then did the Lord scatter them
[51:10] abroad upon the face of the earth now
[51:12] Babel is the original name for Babylon
[51:15] it means confusion it was literally
[51:18] started by Kush the son of ham and but
[51:22] was brought to a kingdom of power and
[51:24] Grandeur through his son nimrod the
[51:27] mighty Hunter Nimrod according to the
[51:30] Genesis 11 account and also according to
[51:33] the profane history set out to
[51:35] accomplish three things he wanted to
[51:37] build a strong nation which he did he
[51:40] wanted to propagate his own religion
[51:42] which he did and he wanted to make a
[51:45] name for himself which he also
[51:48] accomplished his accomplishments were so
[51:50] Monumental that the kingdom of Babylon
[51:53] was called the head of gold among all
[51:55] the world government
[51:57] that is uh that his religion gained
[52:00] prominence is proven by the fact that
[52:02] the scripture identified it uh uh
[52:05] identifies it with Satan completely in
[52:08] Isaiah chapter 14 and in Revelations uh
[52:12] chapters 17 and 18 and by history we can
[52:16] prove that it invaded the whole world
[52:19] and is the basis for every system of
[52:22] idolatry and theme of
[52:25] Mythology though the names of the Gods
[52:27] differ in various sections of the land
[52:30] according to the language of the people
[52:32] that he made a name for himself and his
[52:34] followers goes without saying for as
[52:37] long as this present age goes on until
[52:40] Jesus reveals himself to his Brethren he
[52:42] will be worshiped and honored though
[52:44] under the different name from Nimrod and
[52:48] in a temple slightly different from the
[52:49] one in which he was originally adored
[52:53] now so now brother brother brandom is
[52:55] saying that that that in churches all
[52:57] over the world Satan the the the worship
[53:02] that Nimrod set up is is going uh is is
[53:06] going to be used throughout all the
[53:08] world even in the Christian world so so
[53:11] you you kids if if y all understood that
[53:13] he's uh the system that was set up way
[53:17] back in Babylon uh in the early times
[53:21] has been brought all the way through all
[53:24] the way down and and that system that
[53:29] that Babylonian way of worship is going
[53:32] to be found even in the Christian church
[53:35] today amen so we don't worship Nimrod
[53:38] and we don't say I I I I I'm I worship
[53:41] Nimrod and I worship uh but we are using
[53:44] his system of worship and and that is
[53:48] and we're going to find that it's a
[53:50] diversion away from Christ so
[53:54] um let's see so we'll we'll continue to
[53:57] go on down it says since the Bible does
[54:01] not deal in the histories of other
[54:02] nations in detail it will be necessary
[54:06] to search the ancient profane records to
[54:09] find our answer as to how pergamus
[54:12] become the seat of the satanic religion
[54:15] of Babylon the major source sources of
[54:19] information will be in the records of of
[54:22] Egyptian and crean
[54:24] culture the reason for this is that
[54:27] Egypt received her Science and
[54:28] Mathematics from the Chaldeans and in
[54:31] turn Greece received them from Egypt now
[54:34] since the priests were in charge of
[54:36] teaching these sciences and since the
[54:39] Sciences were part used as part of
[54:42] religion we already know the key as to
[54:45] how the babylonish the babylonish
[54:48] religion gained its strength in these
[54:50] two countries it is also true that
[54:53] whenever a nation was able to over come
[54:56] another nation in due time the religion
[55:00] of the sedu became the religion of the
[55:03] subdued it is well known that the Greeks
[55:06] had the very same signs of the zodiac as
[55:09] did the
[55:10] Babylonians and it has been found in the
[55:13] ancient Egyptian records that the
[55:16] Egyptians gave the Greeks their
[55:18] knowledge of
[55:20] polytheism thus the mysteries of Babylon
[55:24] spread from Nation to Nation until it
[55:26] appeared in Rome in China in India and
[55:30] even in both North and South America we
[55:34] find the same basic
[55:36] worship now so the polytheism is is
[55:41] multiple gods so um so when we when we
[55:45] hear Brother Bram talking about
[55:47] polytheism it's it's not one God hero
[55:49] Israel the Lord thy God is one it's it's
[55:53] multiple
[55:54] gods and so so we're going to find out
[55:57] and the whole deal is today we we we we
[56:00] hear the Trinity all the time everyone's
[56:02] talking about the Holy Trinity so what
[56:05] brother brandom is going to show us
[56:06] tonight uh is that the Trinity has been
[56:10] around for a long time so we have God
[56:15] the Father God the son which is Jesus
[56:18] Christ and then God the Holy Ghost well
[56:21] that's only that's only been around
[56:24] since the Catholics brought it to to the
[56:26] church but there were other gods long
[56:30] time and The Trinity has been around a
[56:32] long time are we doing okay so
[56:34] far amen all right so um let's
[56:40] see okay so it says the ancient
[56:42] histories agree with the Bible that this
[56:45] babylonish religion was most certainly
[56:48] not the original religion of the Earth's
[56:51] early people it was the first to drift
[56:54] away from the original Faith but it was
[56:58] not itself the original ones historians
[57:01] such as Wilkinson and mallet has proven
[57:05] conclusively from the ancient documents
[57:08] that at one time all the peoples of the
[57:13] earth believed in one God Supreme
[57:17] Eternal invisible who by the word of his
[57:20] mouth spoke all things into existence
[57:24] that in his character he was loving and
[57:26] good and just but as Satan will always
[57:31] corrupt whatever he can we find him
[57:34] corrupting the minds and hearts of men
[57:37] so that they reject the truth as he was
[57:41] has always attempted to receive worship
[57:44] as though he were God and not the
[57:46] servant in creation of God he drew
[57:49] worship away from God to the end that he
[57:51] might draw it unto himself and so be
[57:54] exalted he certainly did accomplish his
[57:57] desire to spread his religion throughout
[57:59] the whole world
[58:01] world this is authenticated by God in
[58:04] the Book of Romans when they knew God
[58:06] they glorified him not as God until they
[58:09] become vain in their imaginations and
[58:12] through the darkness of heart accepted a
[58:15] corrupt corrupted religion to the extent
[58:17] that they worship creatures and not the
[58:20] Creator remember Satan was a creature of
[58:23] God the son of the morning thus thus we
[58:26] find that where once truth was
[58:29] disseminated um amongst the people it
[58:33] and and all held to that one truth there
[58:36] later come a day when a vast group
[58:39] turned from God and spread a diabolical
[58:42] form of worship around the world history
[58:45] Bears it out that those of the tribe of
[58:48] Shem that stood with the unchanging
[58:51] truth were in solid opposition to those
[58:54] of ham who turned away from the truth to
[58:58] the devil's lie there is no time in uh
[59:02] to engage in in a discussion of this it
[59:05] is merily introduced that you may see
[59:07] that there were two religions and two
[59:09] only and the evil one became
[59:13] worldwide monotheism monotheism turned
[59:17] to polytheism in Babylon the devil's lie
[59:21] and the devil's Mysteries rose up
[59:24] against the truth of God and and the
[59:26] mysteries of God in that City so brother
[59:29] brandham says the belief in one God turn
[59:32] into the belief of many gods all right
[59:36] so Satan truly become the god of this
[59:38] world and an exact worship uh from those
[59:43] that he had duped causing them to
[59:46] believe that he was truly the
[59:50] Lord the polytheistic religion of the
[59:53] enemy began with a trinitarian Doctrine
[59:56] it was it was way back there in
[59:59] Antiquity that the one God in three
[1:00:02] persons idea came into existence how
[1:00:07] strange that our modern theologians have
[1:00:10] not spotted this but evidently just as
[1:00:14] duped by Satan as their uh forebearers
[1:00:17] were they still believe in three persons
[1:00:21] in the godhead now did y'all understand
[1:00:23] that sister keys if you would if if you
[1:00:26] would go to to uh number two on your
[1:00:29] slides there so so this was not the
[1:00:34] first Babylon had came up with the three
[1:00:37] gods and uh the Nimrod tuse and uh some
[1:00:43] that other name there and then Egypt
[1:00:46] they had their three gods Greece had
[1:00:48] their three Gods India and this is just
[1:00:51] a few of them I I just I I just wrote
[1:00:53] down some of these uh Rome uh at at the
[1:00:57] time at the time that the trinitarians
[1:01:00] were introduced in in
[1:01:03] 3:25 uh Jupiter Mars and Venus was the
[1:01:07] Trinity and so when Christianity came
[1:01:10] down they took the Roman Church the
[1:01:13] early uh the Nan Council took down
[1:01:17] Jupiter Mars and Venus and put up God
[1:01:20] the Father God the son God the Holy
[1:01:22] Ghost and and so so this this this
[1:01:27] theory of the trinitarians did not come
[1:01:30] from Bible now there they say that the
[1:01:34] trinitarians uh trinitarianism comes
[1:01:36] from Bible but it does not come from the
[1:01:38] Bible it it comes from Pagan worship
[1:01:42] that goes all the way back to uh Babylon
[1:01:48] amen are we all clear so
[1:01:50] far praise the Lord all right now it it
[1:01:55] says now let us be shown just one place
[1:01:58] in the scripture where there is any
[1:02:00] Authority for that Doctrine is it not
[1:02:03] strange that while the descendants of
[1:02:06] ham went on their way in satanic worship
[1:02:09] worship which involved a basic concept
[1:02:11] of three gods that there is not one
[1:02:14] trace of The Descendant descendants of
[1:02:17] Shem believing such a thing or having
[1:02:20] any ceremonial worship that involved
[1:02:22] even a type of it is it not strange that
[1:02:26] the Hebrews believed here o Israel the
[1:02:29] Lord thy God is one God if there were
[1:02:33] three persons in the in the godhead
[1:02:35] Abraham the descendant of Shem in
[1:02:38] Genesis 18 saw only one God with two
[1:02:42] angels now how was this Trinity
[1:02:45] expressed it was expressed by uh
[1:02:49] equilateral triangle even as it is
[1:02:52] expressed in Rome today the uh strange
[1:02:57] the the Hebrews did not have such a
[1:02:59] concept now who is right is it the
[1:03:02] Hebrews or the
[1:03:04] Babylonians in Asia the polytheistic
[1:03:08] idea of three Gods uh three gods in one
[1:03:11] came out in the image with three heads
[1:03:14] on one body now now Sister Keys did I
[1:03:17] did I give you that
[1:03:19] uh there was pictures and I don't know
[1:03:22] if I gave it to you or not one body with
[1:03:24] the three heads there should be several
[1:03:27] of them all in one in one
[1:03:29] picture um I didn't send that to you did
[1:03:32] I okay well we'll just go on uh because
[1:03:35] I I I would I had those and I I just
[1:03:38] didn't uh get to send them in India they
[1:03:42] found it in their hearts to express him
[1:03:45] as one God in three forms now that
[1:03:48] really is is good modern day
[1:03:51] theology um in Japan there is a great
[1:03:54] Buddha with three heads like the one we
[1:03:58] previously described so the the way they
[1:04:00] worshiped in the old in in back then it
[1:04:03] was one
[1:04:05] body three heads so saying one person
[1:04:11] three personalities that's what they're
[1:04:13] trying to say so which which we know is
[1:04:16] absolutely insane you cannot be a person
[1:04:19] without a personality so if you've got
[1:04:22] Father Son and Holy Ghost and claim that
[1:04:24] they are one you're you're you need to
[1:04:27] go back to math amen so uh it says the
[1:04:32] most revealing of all that which set
[1:04:34] forth the trinitarian concept of God in
[1:04:37] a Triune form of number one the head of
[1:04:40] an old man symbolizing God the Father a
[1:04:43] circle in the Mysteries signifying seed
[1:04:46] which in turn means the son three the
[1:04:49] wings and Tails of a bird or Dove here
[1:04:53] was the doctrine of Father Son and Holy
[1:04:55] Ghost three persons in the godhead a
[1:04:58] veritable Trinity and you can see the
[1:05:01] same thing in Rome now let me ask one
[1:05:04] once again is it not strange that the
[1:05:07] devil and his worshippers actually had
[1:05:10] more truth revealed than the father of
[1:05:12] Faith Abraham and his descendants is it
[1:05:15] not strange that the worshippers of
[1:05:18] Satan knew more about God than the
[1:05:21] children of God now that is what modern
[1:05:24] theologians try to tell us when they
[1:05:27] talk of a trinity just remember this one
[1:05:30] thing from now on these records are
[1:05:34] facts and this is a fact Satan is a liar
[1:05:38] and the father of lies and when he comes
[1:05:40] with any light it is still a lie he is a
[1:05:43] murderer his doctrine of the Trinity has
[1:05:46] destroyed the multitudes and will
[1:05:48] destroy until Jesus comes according to
[1:05:51] history it did not take long for a
[1:05:54] change to be made and this concept of a
[1:05:56] father and a Son and the Holy
[1:06:00] Ghost Satan took them a step at at a
[1:06:04] time away from the truth the
[1:06:07] evolved concept of deity was now the
[1:06:10] Eternal Father the spirit of God
[1:06:12] incarnate in a human mother that does uh
[1:06:16] does that make you think and a Divine
[1:06:18] son the fruit of that Incarnation the
[1:06:21] woman's seed now he's he's going on into
[1:06:24] uh Mary AR in uh ality there in in the
[1:06:29] Catholic concept he says but the devil
[1:06:32] is not content he hasn't achieved
[1:06:34] worshiped of himself yet except in an
[1:06:37] indirect way so he takes the people away
[1:06:40] from the truth still further and through
[1:06:43] his Mysteries he reveals to the people
[1:06:45] that since the great invisible father
[1:06:48] God does not concern himself in the
[1:06:50] Affairs of men but remain silent
[1:06:53] relative to them then it follows that he
[1:06:56] may well be worshiped in silence
[1:06:59] actually it means to ignore him as much
[1:07:01] as possible if not alltogether this
[1:07:04] doctrine spread around the world also
[1:07:06] and right today in India you can see
[1:07:08] that temples to the great Creator the
[1:07:11] silent God are strikingly few in number
[1:07:15] and since it's not necessary to worship
[1:07:17] Creator father it was now it was only uh
[1:07:21] natural that worship swung to mother and
[1:07:24] child as the objects of adoration in
[1:07:28] Egypt uh was the same combination of
[1:07:31] mother and son called isus and
[1:07:35] oseris in India it was YY and awara note
[1:07:39] the similarity of the names even in Asia
[1:07:42] it was uh Cil cila and dois I'm sorry
[1:07:48] that I don't know those how to pronounce
[1:07:49] those names in Rome and in Greece it
[1:07:52] followed suit and in China well
[1:07:56] imagine the surprise of some Roman
[1:07:58] Catholic missionaries as they entered
[1:08:00] China and found there a Madonna and
[1:08:04] child with rays of light emanating from
[1:08:07] the head of the Babe the image could
[1:08:10] well have been in exchange for one at
[1:08:12] the Vatican except for the difference of
[1:08:15] certain facial features it now behooves
[1:08:18] us to discover the original mother and
[1:08:22] child are we all following so far
[1:08:26] I know I know this reading is uh it
[1:08:29] there's a lot in it is the original
[1:08:32] goddess mother of Babylon was Seamus who
[1:08:36] was called Ria in the Eastern countries
[1:08:39] in her arms she held a babe who though a
[1:08:43] babe was described as tall and strong
[1:08:46] and handsome especially captivating to
[1:08:48] the women in Ezekiel
[1:08:50] 8:14 he was called tamuz
[1:08:54] tamuz among the classical writers he was
[1:08:57] called
[1:08:58] bakas to the Babylonians he was nenus
[1:09:03] what what accounts for the fact that he
[1:09:06] is represented as a babe in arms yet
[1:09:10] described as a great Mighty Man is that
[1:09:13] he is known as the husband's son one of
[1:09:16] the titles was the husband of the mother
[1:09:20] and in India where the two are known as
[1:09:22] wara and YY he the husband is
[1:09:25] represented as the baby at the breast of
[1:09:28] his own
[1:09:30] wife this was nenus uh that that this
[1:09:33] nenus is Nimrod of the Bible we can
[1:09:36] affirm by comparing history with the
[1:09:38] Genesis account pompea said nenus the
[1:09:42] king of Assyria changed the ancient
[1:09:44] moderate way uh moderate ways of life by
[1:09:49] the desire for Conquest he was the first
[1:09:51] who carried war against his neighbors he
[1:09:54] conquered all nations from Assyria to
[1:09:56] Libya as these men knew not the Arts of
[1:10:00] War dor says nenus was the most uh
[1:10:04] ancient of Assyrian Kings mentioned in
[1:10:07] history being of warlike disposition he
[1:10:10] trained young men rigorously in the Arts
[1:10:12] of War he brought Babylonia under him
[1:10:15] while uh yet there was no city of
[1:10:18] Babylon thus we can we see this nenina
[1:10:22] started to become great in Babylon built
[1:10:24] Babel and took over Assyria becoming its
[1:10:28] king then proceeded to devour other vast
[1:10:31] territories where the people were
[1:10:33] unskilled in war and did in moderate way
[1:10:37] in a moderate way as pompus now in
[1:10:41] Genesis 10 speaking of the kingdom of
[1:10:43] nimrod it says the beginning of his
[1:10:46] kingdom was Babel and heric and hacket
[1:10:48] and Conor in the land of
[1:10:51] Shar and out of that went forth Asher
[1:10:54] and build n
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:58] Etc but the translators made a mistake
[1:11:01] in translating Asher as a noun for it's
[1:11:03] for it is a verb and in the child in
[1:11:06] means to make strong thus it is Nimrod
[1:11:10] who having been made the strong he
[1:11:12] established the kingdom by building the
[1:11:14] world's first Army which he trained by
[1:11:16] Drilling and through the rigorous the
[1:11:18] rigorous of hunting and went beyond
[1:11:21] shinard uh with his strong Army and
[1:11:23] subdued Nations and built such cities as
[1:11:26] Nineveh which was named after him for
[1:11:29] even today a chief part of the ruins of
[1:11:32] that city is called
[1:11:35] Nimrod since we have discovered that
[1:11:37] nenus who who nenus was it is now
[1:11:40] necessary to discover who his father was
[1:11:43] according to history it was Bell the
[1:11:45] founder of Babylon now it is it is to be
[1:11:47] noted here that Bell founded it in the
[1:11:50] sense that he started the whole move but
[1:11:53] it was the son nenus that established it
[1:11:56] the first king
[1:11:58] Etc but according to the scripture the
[1:12:00] father of nimrod was kush Kush begat
[1:12:03] Nimrod not only is this so but we find
[1:12:06] that ham begat Kush now in the Egyptian
[1:12:10] culture Bell was called hermis and
[1:12:13] hermis means the son of ham according to
[1:12:16] history hamus was the great prophet of
[1:12:20] idolatry and he was The Interpreter of
[1:12:22] the Gods another name by which he was uh
[1:12:26] called
[1:12:27] Mercury uh henus says this about uh that
[1:12:32] God who was known uh variously as Bell
[1:12:36] Hermes Mercury etc for many ages men
[1:12:39] lived under the the government of zov
[1:12:43] not the Roman jov but the Jehovah of the
[1:12:47] Hebrews who PR predates Roman history
[1:12:50] without cities and without laws and all
[1:12:53] speaking one language but after the
[1:12:55] Mercury uh Bale and Kush interpreted the
[1:12:59] speeches of men whence an interpreter is
[1:13:02] called herent uh whatever his name is
[1:13:06] the same individual distributed the
[1:13:08] Nations this uh then Discord
[1:13:12] begin now uh and and and and we we go on
[1:13:16] on down uh a little bit further but I
[1:13:20] want to stop here so so brother brother
[1:13:23] brandham is what he's doing he's is
[1:13:25] bringing in when he when he talks about
[1:13:27] profane history he's not talking about
[1:13:29] Bible History he's saying that you can
[1:13:30] go back in the records of of when the
[1:13:35] record started back there in Babylon and
[1:13:38] and you will find that they was that
[1:13:40] they was there so um now uh sister khila
[1:13:45] that that uh the statue I think it's
[1:13:50] I've got number four there um so this is
[1:13:56] this here you can see um the the the the
[1:14:00] son that's the son God that's over the
[1:14:03] the woman's that's a woman and then
[1:14:05] that's her son so when when Nimrod had
[1:14:09] died um uh they had deified Nimrod and
[1:14:13] then his then his wife had gotten
[1:14:16] pregnant and she claimed that she was
[1:14:18] impregnated by the Sun and and so now we
[1:14:22] have got mother and son that are ruling
[1:14:26] the Earth and so um so this is is
[1:14:31] basically where uh what we see today we
[1:14:36] have got uh God the Father you can't you
[1:14:38] can't see him so he's he's he's the
[1:14:42] sphere and then you've got Mary and then
[1:14:44] her son that is ruling and so through
[1:14:48] the Catholic Church you you go through
[1:14:50] Mary and uh to get to the sun you've got
[1:14:54] you've got all of these the these forms
[1:14:56] of worship and you can see the reason I
[1:14:58] wanted to bring some of this in tonight
[1:15:01] um not that it matters but I you know to
[1:15:04] to to to a lot of us but that it is to
[1:15:09] to show you that the the trinitarian
[1:15:13] doctrine and the way that it has come
[1:15:15] through in the Catholic church is not
[1:15:19] original from the Bible at all so when
[1:15:22] people says well it talks about the
[1:15:24] father Son and Holy H ghost yeah it does
[1:15:26] talk about the father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:15:28] but not in the way that the that the
[1:15:30] Roman Church has has done it there's not
[1:15:33] three Gods it is one God in three
[1:15:37] offices so um and and then you go to the
[1:15:40] mother lifting up to the son sister keys
[1:15:44] so this is this this is the old this is
[1:15:47] the way that they presented it is is you
[1:15:51] know you had the Eternal one uh the son
[1:15:54] God and then you had mother and child
[1:15:58] and and so this is the concept even with
[1:16:00] Christianity Today you can see that that
[1:16:04] they both come from the same Playbook
[1:16:07] can y'all understand that amen you you
[1:16:09] can see where they come from the same uh
[1:16:11] Playbook But but so when you when you
[1:16:14] talk about Trinity we're going back to
[1:16:18] the origins and it's and it's going to
[1:16:20] be in important because as we as we go
[1:16:24] further
[1:16:25] this is where this here in
[1:16:29] 3:25 uh ad is where the separation took
[1:16:33] place this is before then it's just been
[1:16:37] it's been the Deeds of the nianis it's
[1:16:40] been the Deeds it's
[1:16:41] been or the you know just just actions
[1:16:45] and and whisperings and and a few Deeds
[1:16:48] but now Satan is fixing to make this a
[1:16:51] Doctrine and he's fixing to drive it
[1:16:53] down and the way they done it was
[1:16:56] introducing the Trinity to the church
[1:17:00] they would forever damned themselves and
[1:17:03] would end up damning the entire uh uh
[1:17:06] Christian culture uh uh you know
[1:17:09] denominational culture because this will
[1:17:12] separate here o Israel the Lord thy God
[1:17:14] is one Lord there's not three there is
[1:17:19] one and what Satan has done he he he
[1:17:23] brought this in and started bringing it
[1:17:26] all over to him and and it was it was
[1:17:29] through it was through this that he was
[1:17:31] able to start changing things around and
[1:17:34] and and through one lie goes another lie
[1:17:36] and then goes another lie until today
[1:17:39] you can read the Bible that a woman
[1:17:41] shoulds not to cut her hair and it and
[1:17:43] and and they say well God don't mean
[1:17:45] that am they they go on it just they
[1:17:49] it's but the original lie started with
[1:17:52] that Trinity until today people are
[1:17:55] going to church and totally worshiping
[1:17:58] Satan they're not worship the the word
[1:18:01] means nothing anymore in the beginning
[1:18:03] was the word the word is with God the
[1:18:05] Word was God and it's no longer the word
[1:18:08] it's it's it's just a religious form and
[1:18:11] focus all right so any questions here uh
[1:18:14] uh
[1:18:15] tonight any any anything that anyone
[1:18:18] wants to add uh uh so far now this
[1:18:21] because this is a whole lot of reading
[1:18:24] and and and you can't you can't you know
[1:18:27] you can't uh get to it all and when we
[1:18:30] we're going to start the next time
[1:18:32] in9 and then he's going to start dealing
[1:18:34] with that counsil and so I'm not going
[1:18:37] to read just a whole bunch more here
[1:18:39] here this evening I might read another
[1:18:40] paragraph here in a minute but but y'all
[1:18:43] uh y'all understanding where we're at
[1:18:46] you understand
[1:18:48] why the that that that God uh says there
[1:18:54] in in
[1:18:55] in in the Old Testament that in that day
[1:18:58] when it's when it's uh it it's it's not
[1:19:02] going to be daylight and it's not going
[1:19:03] to be dark but it's going to be the
[1:19:05] Twilight he says it'll it'll be a day
[1:19:09] amen just of of of of of you know just
[1:19:12] dismal light but there shall be light
[1:19:15] and in that day his name shall be one
[1:19:18] again and and that's this great
[1:19:20] revelation of the godhead has been
[1:19:23] restored to us again it's important to
[1:19:27] know get it get it straight get it
[1:19:30] straight because this is not just
[1:19:32] religion this is God coming down being a
[1:19:36] human Among Us and if you don't see that
[1:19:39] if you're if you're doing some kind of a
[1:19:42] Babylonian uh tradition you're missing
[1:19:45] out what God is what God is doing it's
[1:19:48] God becoming a human
[1:19:51] being living in you and there is not a
[1:19:55] religion on the earth that that can ever
[1:19:57] produce that nothing nothing can produce
[1:20:01] that God living in our
[1:20:06] bodies and I I I think that's the most
[1:20:08] glorious thing any any questions or any
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:15] comments praise the
[1:20:19] Lord
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:22] so um
[1:20:25] so if you you know we we we're we're
[1:20:28] thankful we're thankful for the godhead
[1:20:30] did you have something someone have
[1:20:32] something over
[1:20:33] here amen I seen a
[1:20:36] smile praise the
[1:20:38] Lord amen
[1:20:46] yeah
[1:20:51] yeah yeah
[1:20:54] yeah it did it did yeah it it took a it
[1:20:57] took a profit to bring to to to bring
[1:21:00] that uh uh out to us and to really it to
[1:21:06] to Really
[1:21:08] um show why Satan would do what he was
[1:21:12] trying to do because we're going back to
[1:21:16] Eden and again you know as as I've as
[1:21:20] I've said several times God did not
[1:21:22] start a religion in the book of Genesis
[1:21:25] it was it was the king the Eternal God
[1:21:29] who created a body called him his son
[1:21:33] and and it was it was a king and his
[1:21:35] Prince and it was a ruler it was to it
[1:21:38] was to rule and Reign here on Earth
[1:21:40] that's what the beginning was and and
[1:21:43] it's and it's not God's desire for us to
[1:21:45] build churches and all of us become a
[1:21:47] part of a 10 do the 10 commandments and
[1:21:49] that it's church church is not the
[1:21:53] reason for Christianity
[1:21:55] it's all part of it and we're learning
[1:21:57] and we're and but but it the the the the
[1:22:00] vision of God is to live in man on Earth
[1:22:05] where the king and his children Rule and
[1:22:08] Reign amen that's why God don't want you
[1:22:11] being religious don't ever be satisfied
[1:22:14] with just being religious God wants
[1:22:17] every one of us Amen to rule and reign
[1:22:20] with him Sons and Daughters of God
[1:22:23] living and reality amen and it's the
[1:22:26] great Eternal God that that that came
[1:22:30] inside a body amen he created that body
[1:22:34] in the womb of Mary but Mary was Mary is
[1:22:38] is is is no more eternal Mary had to
[1:22:42] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:44] just like you and I have to receive the
[1:22:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost there was
[1:22:48] nothing any special about Mary amen
[1:22:52] other than God chose her to be the
[1:22:54] incubator God chose her Amen to place
[1:22:58] the seed and to care for that seed but
[1:23:01] but she is no more the mother of God
[1:23:03] than I'm the mother or the father of God
[1:23:06] Amen Mary is not the mother of God she
[1:23:09] was simply The
[1:23:11] Vessel the incubator as brother Brandon
[1:23:13] would put it so that we can understand
[1:23:15] it and for those of us that that that
[1:23:17] watch the the the chickens or the the
[1:23:19] Ducks hatch the incubator just that's
[1:23:22] just the ones that that that that kept
[1:23:25] the seed alive or or kept it warm so it
[1:23:27] can do its thing and God created a seed
[1:23:31] put it in the womb of Mary amen and Mary
[1:23:35] carried that baby but Jesus was not that
[1:23:38] Jesus was not the son of of of Mary and
[1:23:44] Joseph amen there wasn't a bit of there
[1:23:46] wasn't a bit of human blood in Jes in in
[1:23:50] in that in that seed God created that
[1:23:52] blood cell so he's not Jew he's not
[1:23:55] Gentile the Bible says in the book of
[1:23:57] Acts we are saved by the blood of
[1:24:01] God Amen so so we've got to understand
[1:24:05] that which totally blows away the theory
[1:24:08] of of what the Catholic church has tried
[1:24:10] to do with Mary amen so so y'all Y y'all
[1:24:14] y'all understand that I know it's it's
[1:24:16] it's it's just as simple as that and as
[1:24:18] we get into it then then then you're
[1:24:20] going to understand how the Divide
[1:24:23] begins to really take place but it
[1:24:25] started there in
[1:24:27] 325 and and it and it's grown on until
[1:24:30] all of the whole world is going to be
[1:24:32] following after that system sister
[1:24:39] titha
[1:24:49] yeah yeah
[1:25:10] yeah
[1:25:12] yeah
[1:25:19] yes yes
[1:25:25] know
[1:25:28] word amen and and and I and and that is
[1:25:32] true because uh brother brandham it
[1:25:34] showed and and and he and um and you
[1:25:38] know you could read the uh hiss Two
[1:25:40] Babylons which is uh which brother
[1:25:44] brandham uh said that he studied a lot
[1:25:46] but it's a hard book to read I mean woo
[1:25:50] uh if you think this is a lot of
[1:25:52] information that the information in hiss
[1:25:54] I mean it it it it'll take you uh two
[1:25:57] hours just to read a page you know
[1:25:59] because it's it's got so much in it but
[1:26:04] but that's and I thought brother
[1:26:06] brandham done a good job here at saying
[1:26:08] no matter what it was in which society
[1:26:11] or which part of culture it different
[1:26:15] names and he will go on saying that uh
[1:26:17] if you were to read another page or two
[1:26:19] he would say what we get out of this is
[1:26:22] no matter what time in history no matter
[1:26:25] where you are there is a trinity and all
[1:26:28] cultures are worshiping that the Trinity
[1:26:32] comes in different names and so here
[1:26:35] today Satan is being worshiped in the
[1:26:39] titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[1:26:43] so looking into those that's that's very
[1:26:46] very true uh sister tibitha and um uh we
[1:26:51] we ought to be thankful for that there's
[1:26:53] one God and he's living in
[1:26:57] Meen praise the Lord somebody else that
[1:27:00] was that was really that was a good
[1:27:02] addition sister
[1:27:03] Tabitha amen anyone else brother
[1:27:19] Merl yeah
[1:27:32] yes
[1:27:34] yeah
[1:27:40] yeah
[1:27:50] yeah yeah
[1:27:54] deception yeah that's right
[1:27:58] yes
[1:28:05] tion yes y yep
[1:28:11] only amen
[1:28:22] amen they they entire thing the entire
[1:28:26] and and and and we're not you know and
[1:28:29] it's going to be he's going to next
[1:28:31] Wednesday night you'll see that it was
[1:28:34] so beautifully
[1:28:35] prophesied because it was once in
[1:28:39] Babylon and now it is moved to pergamus
[1:28:42] where Satan's seat is it is moved from
[1:28:46] Pagan uh the Babylonian system now it's
[1:28:50] moved into the church and and
[1:28:54] and and and that's so be and that
[1:28:56] happened in in uh
[1:28:59] 325 and so yeah it it's it's quite it's
[1:29:03] quite amazing and I'm so
[1:29:07] thankful I'm so thankful that the Lord
[1:29:09] has opens our eyes to see these kinds of
[1:29:12] things and to be able to look at this
[1:29:15] and think oh God not not that we have to
[1:29:18] understand everything that is that is
[1:29:19] read tonight that's not that's that's
[1:29:21] not that's not important what we wanted
[1:29:24] to understand whether you memorize this
[1:29:26] stuff or not what we're trying to show
[1:29:28] is is is brother brandom is letting us
[1:29:31] see that
[1:29:33] Trinity has been here all the way uh
[1:29:38] since Adam or or since Noah's Three
[1:29:42] Sons you know uh uh there was ham sham
[1:29:46] and and jasf and so we find that ham it
[1:29:50] was his seed that that that started this
[1:29:54] all the way back in that in in that day
[1:29:56] and that it has been going all the way
[1:29:58] through so trinitarianism is not
[1:30:00] anything new not at all it's just it's
[1:30:03] it's uh it's just an old Pagan system
[1:30:07] that Satan found his way to get
[1:30:10] into
[1:30:20] amen yeah
[1:30:27] yeah
[1:30:31] yeah yeah yeah that's right it's a
[1:30:35] distraction it it it as brother Merl
[1:30:38] said deception brings distraction
[1:30:41] because today truly is it TR it's it's
[1:30:44] just like it's it's just like
[1:30:46] Pentecostalism the the Satan wants you
[1:30:49] to get in the jump and the shout and
[1:30:51] this and that and you miss you miss the
[1:30:53] whole purpose it's God in a being it's
[1:30:58] the word in flesh see and and and and
[1:31:02] Satan wants to do this deception thing
[1:31:05] an emotional thing and and and and and
[1:31:08] it truly is that's that's a good word
[1:31:10] it's a distraction from what the real
[1:31:13] true purpose of what God has done in
[1:31:15] this day that's beautiful and I this is
[1:31:18] a Rapture where God's where God is going
[1:31:21] to be so in his people that we shall
[1:31:24] uh have a have a body change amen and
[1:31:28] shall forever more be with the Lord
[1:31:29] sister
[1:31:33] Carol well you know I I I have not um
[1:31:38] I've not just studied a whole lot as far
[1:31:40] as as um uh on the Native American side
[1:31:46] I I I do know that that there is a lot
[1:31:52] um traditionally
[1:31:54] ISM that you know they've got the you
[1:31:57] know the Earth is the mother the it's
[1:31:59] it's the same type it's the same type
[1:32:01] there is you know the great spirit and
[1:32:04] um and and they you know Mother Earth
[1:32:07] and and then um uh the great spirit God
[1:32:11] it's basically the same type of worship
[1:32:14] H it you know because most most all your
[1:32:17] religions today even today uh whether it
[1:32:19] be Buddha um uh Hindus it's it's they
[1:32:24] use the Sun and the Moon and so the sun
[1:32:27] is is is is the is the male and then the
[1:32:31] Moon is is the woman and uh the
[1:32:35] fertility and things of that nature but
[1:32:38] um you know it in in every one of these
[1:32:42] religions it is never whether it be the
[1:32:45] Native American religion or whether it
[1:32:47] be Hinduism or there is never a religion
[1:32:51] where that God comes and lives in a
[1:32:55] human being and lives out his purpose in
[1:32:58] them it's it just doesn't it just
[1:33:00] doesn't happen so so it it is beautiful
[1:33:03] and and I I thought it was interesting
[1:33:06] you know on on Alba's U uh the the Wake
[1:33:10] there and and and just going back over
[1:33:12] the rituals and things that that they do
[1:33:15] that the rituals are
[1:33:18] fine you know they all have their
[1:33:20] meanings but that was all accomplished
[1:33:23] in Christ Jesus Jesus Paid the price so
[1:33:28] that we can be totally free we don't
[1:33:31] have to go through any kind of ritualism
[1:33:33] we don't have to it it all of these
[1:33:35] things are done blood has taken care of
[1:33:38] us so that his Spirit can come and live
[1:33:42] in us now there's now all of the all the
[1:33:46] Traditions are dead and past because God
[1:33:49] lives in me and that makes it beautiful
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:55] wonderful comments here tonight by the
[1:34:10] way
[1:34:12] yeah yeah yeah
[1:34:29] yeah
[1:34:33] yeah
[1:34:42] yeah
[1:34:50] yeah amen
[1:35:03] amen you know and and and when he when
[1:35:07] when Jesus says when or yeah he talking
[1:35:10] to the Pharisees say now when he speaks
[1:35:11] an error he speaks of his
[1:35:14] own but but the elect of God we come
[1:35:17] from the genetics of God that one and
[1:35:20] true Living God through that predestin
[1:35:23] seed and that's the reason why we accept
[1:35:26] truth We Believe truth and we can't be
[1:35:29] deceived because we come from that this
[1:35:33] is not religion this is a living God and
[1:35:37] a living son living daughters that's
[1:35:41] right predestinated and to be into His
[1:35:44] Image it's who we are it's what we are
[1:35:47] just as much as as uh amen the the
[1:35:52] genetics of mom and dad is within us so
[1:35:55] is it with the genetics of God within
[1:35:58] within us as well amen praise the lord
