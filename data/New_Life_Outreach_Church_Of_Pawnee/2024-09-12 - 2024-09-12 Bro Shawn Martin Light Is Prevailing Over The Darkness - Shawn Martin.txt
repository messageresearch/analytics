the Lord and I appreciate his faithfulness and his love for the message love for the people of God Amen and um I just believe we're going to have a good time uh this weekend and I I know uh you've been praying and been preparing and you know um just believe that where Believers are gu together amen God just shows up and does the miraculous uh because the people are expecting amen God to do something amen and how many's got a need maybe that you have that you just need God to to to meet I wonder if we could just go to the word or to the Lord in prayer and maybe just place that need on your heart and and uh we just ask the Lord just to move father Lord we stand before you with Humble Hearts you'll see the needs that are present here father and Lord we're looking to you for you alone can meet them you're the Healer of all of our diseases whether it be spiritually physically mentally Lord father your children are gathered here because we just believe that you've ordained it to be so that you want to work Among Us and now Lord we just ask that you would meet every need that is present maybe those that are even watching online maybe you'd go where they're at and that you'd meet their need father we just believe that you're alive and well and whatever the situation would be Lord It's defeated it can't hold your children I pray that you'd bring a refreshing upon the people here father and just renew Lord Brother Wendell renew the the the congregation father we we just look into you father we love you I pray that you would just bless the ministering of your word tonight and help just get ourselves out of the way father and let you speak through me I pray father father in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord if you just have your Bibles we're just going to go right on to the word amen and um I want to first of all look maybe at the book of Ephesians the um the sixth chapter amen and just count it a an honor to uh preach um a meeting with um such uh men of great caliber brother Jonathan and brother Ben and praise the Lord and uh looking forward to a wonderful time in the Lord amen and so uh the book of Ephesians the 6th chapter and we're going to start at the 10th verse it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now if you would like to turn with me to the uh Book of Matthew Matthew the um 4th chapter and I'm going to start at maybe the 12th verse Matthew 4 and verse 12 it says now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernum which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zebulun and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaas the prophet saying the land of zabulon and the land of netham uh by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up amen one more scripture and that's first Peter 2 and9 amen first um Peter 2 and N then I'll let you have your seats praise the Lord very familiar scripture to us but it says you but you are a chosen generation a royal priest Ood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but now but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy amen may the Lord just add a blessing to his word and you can have your seats for a moment or two amen and I guess if I would use a title I would um title it the light is prevailing over the darkness and um you know the Bible tells us that God has a purpose how many believes that and the Paul the Apostle Paul says that it is an eternal purpose amen meaning that it cannot fail it will always be and and I'm so glad that I'm part of that purpose how many believes you're part of the purpose of God Amen and uh not just that we're we're part of it but I I believe that we're in this age playing a a great part of uh uh God's uh uh purpose and uh for this time we are living in the end time of all things the end of all things the end of of time the end of of civilization as we know it to be we end of politics end of just everything and and which means that what God has been doing he is finishing up amen he is uh it's it's being finished up with with you and I do you believe that and so I I believe that we're the last people amen we're the last age we're the last generation uh we are the final voice to the final Age and and and this is important because we know that all of the saints that have gone on before us cannot be made perfect without us amen and so so this this age uh uh everything that God has done Through the Ages amen this this this age is the completion of of of it all so all the other ages are depending upon us now Calvary was a great thing and and I'm I'm I'm glad for Calvary we can't underestimate uh Calvary and what what was done there and and and and things but I I just believe that that the age that we're living in is even greater than what Calvary Calvary was in the fact that yes Calvary was a real battle that Jesus uh uh uh fought and and and that that battle was uh uh fought that we could be free how many believes that amen uh Calvary was was a battle that that Jesus fought for our healing for our deliverance for our Salvation amen for the changing of our body then and and everything Calvary uh was that and I'm I'm glad for that but in this day we are his victory do you believe that amen we are the proof that Calvary was effective we we are the proof that what Jesus did amen it's one thing to say I've overcome but we are the proof that he overcome amen and and and and everything when he said it is finished amen your salvation was finished your healing was finished everything was finished at Calvary amen but but what good would that be if if there was not a people to show the victory of that amen and so we are the people do you believe that amen but it's in this age that Believers are fighting harder than any other uh uh believer uh had to fight in any other age uh this is the battle amen and and the Warfare that is Raging we are it seems like we are fighting one battle after another battle after battle blow after blow and and and uh uh it's not just the elders it's not just the preachers it's it's it's it's it's you young people it's it's uh uh it it just seems it from all ages it seems like the devil is attacking and we we're we're we're facing the enemy where we feel it uh physically we feel it spiritually we feel it mentally it it it's just that way amen and brother brandom in his prayer one time said he said Lord thy children are struggling in these days for the oppression of the enemy is so strong amen I I'm sure you feel that do do you feel that it it's a pressure amen uh uh where you feel sometimes you feel lost sometimes you just don't feel like you're going to make it sometimes it's just a Warfare Amen in the mind and and the reason why is because of the contest amen uh uh uh that is going on uh which actually started in heaven Before Time Ever began amen and and we know that Satan rebelled against God Amen and caused 2third of the of the angels to follow after him which we would call them Fallen Angels or uh demonic spirits ain't that right amen and and the prophet said see amen now Satan was kicked out into the Earth God wasn't going to let that Rebellion stay up there amen so he kicked Satan out and all these uh uh uh uh followers uh demonic powwers uh uh spirits kick them out amen and the prophet said and then Satan become an enemy to God's people amen Satan Satan didn't humble himself he he didn't repent of of what he'd done but he has sought Amen to destroy God's kingdom he has sought to defy God and to keep God's word from prosper in anything that has to do with God Satan is against ain't that right and so the prophet would tell us now Satan was kicked out into the Earth and then he become an enemy to God's people and since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to pull God's people uh across the fires or Into the Fire ain't that right now you know uh Abraham Lincoln one time said it's it's in the time of peace that you prepare for war amen and and and that is so true you you may be in a in a place right now that you're feeling joy and you're feeling peace and you're feeling you know everything is going good but but don't don't just settle there you better prepare for war you better prepare for a battle amen because it's coming it's it's not there there you can't do nothing about it you you can't run from it amen you can't hide from it you can't be sweet sweet enough from it you know you understand what I'm saying amen there ain't no preacher that can preach the biggest message and the baddest message amen except he's going to fight the devil every preacher fights the devil every every uh uh every saint fights the devil your mama fights your daddy fights your deacons fight amen your children fight everybody fights it can you say amen amen so brother brandom said see it's in a time while everything is running smooth you better get ready for Satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long you're in a convention now amen and everything would just pour along fine but you're going to leave here in a few days and you're going to meet the enemy and he may not even wait till you get ready to leave he might attack any time he's wicked and he's ruthless can you say Amen your enemy is wicked and he's ruthless he does not love you he wants to destroy you he'll take your mind he'll take your he'll take your health he'll take your spiritual Joy he'll Captivate you to where you can't even lift your hands to worship God anymore amen that's just the enemy that we're facing ain't that right he said see but he just carries on where whenever he can whatever he can say or do he does it right now see so it's best to be dressed all the time another place he says as we leave this building to go into our different places and our homes and to meet out outside to meet the world let us not go as we have in formal times don't don't meet the enemy like like maybe the other Church ages have don't don't meet the enemy like the the Pentecostals on austa street did don't you meet the enemy the way the denominations are trying to meet the enemy let's go let's not meet the enemy as we have in in formal times notice what he says let's go in the power of his resurrection let's go in the name of Jesus Christ with the banner High lifted high and with faith in his word to handle the two-edged sword with the shield and the full armor of God on to meet the enemy because he the enemy is getting stronger and more powerful every day can you say Amen your enem is not getting weaker he's getting more powerful he's getting more stronger amen he's he's doing everything he can can you say amen he sure is he so he says now notice he says if we've come to the end of these things and the mysteries of God has been completed with us we are looking for more strength more strength a rapturing strength to meet a worse Force that'll Rapture the church and take it into Glory we must have it so there is an enemy we're not we're this isn't a picnic this isn't just something that we just hang out you know and and and no no no when you start serving the lord that enem is after you too amen he's just after us this is why first Peter 5'8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary not just an adversary but your adversary he's your personal he's been suited just for you he knows your ins he knows your outs he knows your nature he knows your makeup and he's your adversary he knows exactly where to come at you with he knows that your nervous problems he knows everything about you and he's your adversary he studies you can you say amen amen but he says he walks as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devire so I I say this because it's not God that is against you it's not God that has left you alone it's not the fact that God hates you it's it's not the fact that amen you've walked away from mercy and and it's just simply there's an enemy that is attacking it's he's on the attack at all times can you say Amen so it's not that God doesn't love you it's not that God isn't going to fulfill his word in you it isn't that God started out to and then all of a sudden he's decided you're not going to make it and you can't make it in you know God will never never tell you you're not going to make it in a Rapture that's the devil doing that amen there's nothing negative in Christianity amen so if there's a negative thought in your mind it's the devil that's putting that Amen in your mind it's your enemy that is talking to you can you say Amen it may not be an autal voice amen but it could just be negative thoughts well I'm just not good enough I'm just not worthy I I I just don't know if I can make that is your enemy that is talking to you trying to wear you down can you say amen amen see so we've got an enemy and it's not God it it's not your pastor it's not your brothers and sisters it's just simply there is an enemy amen and and he's after you amen simply because there is a plan amen God's got a plan and a purpose for your life amen now so so what is it why why what what what is all this Warfare amen what's all this uh uh uh seems resistance everywhere why why can't we just find the peace why why can't we just just you know just have a picnic every once in a while what is it well the prophet just explains what it is it's the darkness Gathering itself Amen to try to keep the light from coming can you say Amen now you think of that now now it's the darkness the darkness knows that God is wrapping this thing up he's got one last chance Satan's got one last chance so he FTS amen he couldn't ruin that plan at Calvary he couldn't ruin that plan in the Old Testament he couldn't ruin it with the new church uh amen he's tried he's tried to take the joy he's tried to take the peace uh he has stripped that church uh that here now is a bride that is starting to rise up and Satan's doing everything in his power to withstand this thing Amen to defeat you oh yes sir amen it is amen so what is it that you're warning against it's the power of Darkness can you say Amen it's the power amen then so if the devil is fighting against us then we must not underestimate ourselves amen don't underestimate your enemy but don't underestimate yourself amen because then there must be something valuable that God sees in you amen if Satan is attacking you then there's something that Satan is after amen if if if if he is doing all he can young people to destroy your life then that means that God's got a plan and Satan is after that Jewel Satan's after that word Satan's after that promise Satan's after everything to keep you from coming to what God has ordained for you now why would the enemy try to keep the light amen the darkness the enemy trying to keep the light from coming because light holds the power of life amen light can you say Amen but not only does it holds the power of life it is also proof that God's word is effective a oh do you believe that amen it's one thing for God to say something amen but when when when when that something amen manifest itself then it's greater than just God speaking it amen because now the word that God spoke is now made manifest a ain't that right amen see amen so if you if you remember you know in the in the beginning uh uh there were seeds laying in the earth there there were seeds ain't that right and they just laid dormant in the Earth because Darkness covered the Earth amen the water depth of water covered the Earth amen and now we can we can look back now and see why they laid dormant we don't know how long they were there Amen in the Earth but God had put them in the earth and they lay dormant in that Earth and there's a reason why they lay dormant because there was no light amen there was no power of life amen to to Quicken that seed God needed a light Amen to shine to Quicken the seed ain't that right amen yes sir amen see nothing the prophet said nothing can live without light nothing whether it's physically or or naturally or spiritually a ain't that right so then if there's no light then God's purpose for planting the seed in the Earth would not be made known if there hadn't been light ain't that right well you know brother brandom tells us that we're part of the earth amen you you are part of the earth ain't that right amen and as God planted a natural seed in the earth God also planted a word seed inside of you yes sir amen and it had been lay Dorth there amen and it just needed a light to come across that seed and to Quicken that seed to bring it to manifestation so therefore God said let there be light and there was light amen and the natural light appeared and brought all the natural seed to life do you believe that so in the message of turning on the light brother Ram talks about light and how that light is a manifest the word of God made manifest when you look in that light it's the word of God made manifest ain't that right oh my amen so we're talking about spiritual light amen natural light but spiritual light is what I'm speaking of tonight amen and so therefore spiritual darkness is trying to keep that spiritual light amen from from coming forth he's trying to keep the word of God that spiritual light or uh uh the seed amen from uh uh uh being manifested now the prophet tell tells us we know it amen what is a word it's a thought expressed amen so a word has an origin and it's the thought the thought is the origin the thought exists first before the word can you say Amen so the seed of God Amen it began as a thought of God Amen and brother brandom said they are Premed itated thoughts so this isn't just thoughts that just pass through God's mind you you you all know how we get them thoughts Satan can put thoughts in our minds and we get little thoughts and then we say well why would I think that you know and why do this and why you know but but with God Amen Satan couldn't put a thought contrary Amen to God's nature and God's ability and God's purpose and and God's desire amen the thoughts that God had amen come from him they're holy holy thoughts they're righteous thoughts they they are pure thoughts they're they're powerful thoughts and they're premeditated thoughts in other words he dwelt upon them by these thoughts he formulated a plan can you say amen and so therefore it makes us an attribute of God's thinking that's how you exist it it you're an attribute of God's thinking ain't that right see and so that's what God planted inside of you was a word seed amen that that was a thought premeditated thought of his and so therefore before that word jeene seed could come up in us God had to bring forth light can you say amen amen and it also had to come forth by the spoken word of God as the naturalite did now let's just look at it Jesus amen was an attribute of God's thinking how many believes that he was an attribute of God's thinking in God's mind he was the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world Amen before the beginning of time God thought of himself becoming tangible amen and and dwelling among men so therefore the body of Jesus Christ was predestinated for that very purpose do you believe that amen Jesus was God in flesh amen see and so therefore Jesus was a premeditated thought of God brother Braham said Jesus was slain before the world even had the first Speck of dirt laid Jesus was already slayed he said why here it is get it God by for knowledge when he was the word in the beginning perceived the thought now it's just the thought then when he spoke it and said it shall be then Jesus was slain the very minute God spoke the word can you say amen and I just may I just said you were saved the very minute God spoke the word you were delivered the very moment God spoke the word you were Justified the very moment God spoke the word you were glorified the very moment that God spoke the word it's all premeditated do you believe that and so Jesus amen was the lamb slain the very moment that God spoke the word and said it shall be see he perceived the thought now it's just the thought see amen then he says then what 4,000 years later 4,000 years later he came see and paid the price that God had already done back here by his word he had to come everybody say Jesus had to come Jesus to do you believe that Jesus had to come and so do you have to come and all devils in Hell couldn't keep him from coming God had already spoke it come on can you say amen amen see well then how do you know that all devils in Hell couldn't keep him from coming because they tried it all down Through the Ages Satan had been trying to keep that word of God from prevailing he had been trying to keep that light from coming forth yes sir they tried it you see he was predestinated to be the sacrifice he was predestinated to be the prophet he was predestinated to be the priest and to be the king what Joseph was Christ was predestinated to be what David was Christ was predestinated to be amen what he what abble was uh Christ was predestinated to be what Moses was uh Christ was predestinated to be see he was the word that came to them and their lives reflected what he was predestinated to be can you say amen that's why Prophet said it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in David it it was he was reflecting of what he would be when he come in that body of Flesh God was always showing that the word had come God was already showing that it was established through all the prophecy through all the saints of old he was only reflecting of what was already going to come he knew it was going to come and he testified through them that it was coming and so he as he testified through Ruth that you were coming can you say amen he testified amen through through uh Rahab the Harlot that you were coming he testified amen through the Saints of old that you were coming [Applause] yes [Applause] sir see what you were predestinated to be they spoke [Music] of it's true and then the word everybody say the word word became flesh the word became manifested in flesh can you say Amen the word of God Amen just as that sun outside amen when you see the sun tomorrow shining that is the word of God God made manifest uh well Jesus became flesh uh the word that was spoken of him became flesh manifested hallu you see Jesus was not the second person in the godhead he was the person and the only person in the godhead can you say Amen all that God thought of himself becoming he became in Jesus Christ God thought of himself as a redeemer God thought of himself as a Healer God thought of himself as a way maker God thought of himself as king God thought of himself as a husband all of it became in [Music] Christ so in the Old Testament yeah God wasn't speaking of another person to come come on come on he was speaking of himself becoming [Music] [Applause] flesh ain't that right yes sir and so we know that Jesus Christ was the expressed image of God he was the visible image of the invisible God he said in Hebrew John 14:9 he that has seen me has seen the father he also said in John 657 I live by the father ain't that right the prophet said how did he live by the Father the father was in him he was just the Tabernacle of [Music] [Applause] godl Amen so therefore he was so full of quickening power and that quickening power quickened the word making him the living Worden the word that was written now become living in the body of Flesh ain't that right the word became flesh the word manifested in flesh so this is why in John 812 Jesus said I am the light of the world ain't that right because he was the manifested word of God Amen he was that light amen the light see John 1:14 the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so the full word was manifested in him he wasn't a type and a shadow on he was the Fulfillment of the type and Shadow he was the light ain't that right Jesus said of himself that he was true he said I am the true bread I am the True Vine see I I I I am these things I'm the true amen see the Mana that fell from heaven in the Old Testament that was just a type God again showing what Jesus would be Amen brother Bram said see that bread in the Old Testament it did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it become contaminated but if any man eats of that true bread that came from Heaven he'll never hunger again that's exactly what God was [Music] after he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no no need any longer for a shatter no need for partial sh salvation here is the whole of it can you say amen amen in the revelation of Jesus Christ Christ he is revealed as he that is true amen and and brother B says in other words he is the perfect realization not partial he's perfect realization of every type and Shadow that spoke of him ain't that right amen so 1 John 2 and8 it says because the darkness is passed the True Light now shineth the True Light can you sayen now brother brandom says this he says no one could deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was as when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it but in the homes of the Israelites there was light but now True Light everybody say True Light True Light is come see the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the light amen by means of the scripture relative Amen to the Messiah thus Israel had light but now the Fulfillment of the light had come see and what was but glowing word has now broken forth in the brightness of God manifested among his people what was a glowing word is now a light shining the brightness of God amen he says now as the pillar of fire gave light at night and he says and that was wonderful wonderful to have a pillar fire amen a light by night see now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily in the body of Jesus Christ and the Darkness the darkness gathered itself together to keep that light from shining to keep that light to take out that light to put out that light can you say Amen but Jesus was not standing in his own power he was standing by the power of the spoken word and you're not standing by your own power you're not standing by your own will you're not standing by your own mind you're standing by the power of the spoken word [Applause] you're standing somebody say I'm standing I'm standing by his word Herod being anointed of the devil tried to kill him right from the start religious leaders being anointed of the devil constantly constantly sought to kill him what was it it was the darkness trying to put out the light just like it is with you why do you go through discouragements it's the darkness that is trying to put out the light why do you have your mind battles it's the darkness trying to put out the light you say well I'm I'm sick I'm not feeling good amen it's the darkness that is trying to put out the light amen Satan would love nothing more than to shut us preachers up from preaching this message he'll get us sick he'll get us discouraged he'll get us to quit he'll get us to do everything and it's just the darkness that is trying to put off the light and he's trying to get you young people to quit too amen but don't you listen to that enemy don't you listen to that old old slewfoot liing devil amen it's just the darkness that is trying to put out the [Applause] light now notice they finally crucified Jesus and Satan thought he had finally succeeded in putting the light out he was placed in the Tomb never to be heard of again in brother Bri said the world put him in a tomb and sealed him up in that tomb with a Roman seal ain't that right and they sealed him in that tomb to make him just a historical figure don't mind you talking about him as long as he's not alive don't mind you singing about him as long as he's not affected to you can you say Amen as long as the light shining there's a predestinated seat that's going to come up we got to put that out so they wanted to make him a historical figure a God that used to heal a God that used to save a God that that that just leaves his people with Habits and Hangups and and and just barely making along and and oh yeah they talk about him they sing about him but they really don't know the power of him that's exactly what the enemy wanted to do [Applause] brother BR said they thought they got rid of him just like Cain thought he got rid of Abel but you see the man the purpose of him being manifested in the first place was to destroy the works of the [Music] devil hello he allowed the devil to kill him to show that he can destroy the power of death that's good ain't that right so here he was sealed up in the Tomb but on Resurrection morning you all know it in the Easter in the rising of the sun brother BR said on that Easter morning there was a duel Sunrise not only the natural son Rose but the Son of God Rose both of them was the spoken word of God and death couldn't stop it time couldn't stop it trial couldn't stop it the darkness no matter how how dark the night was it could not stop it he was Rising by the spoken [Music] word can you say Amen yes sir brother BR said they thought they they could destroy it by by uh uh they thought they could destroy it made flesh by placing him in a tomb driving a spear through his heart but watch the spirit of God making a way by an Angel rolling the stone away rolling the stone away I want to just tell you right now you know the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this [Music] message amen God Amen would show his word effective by sending an angel amen something that them women could not do something that was impossible to do amen that God by by his word would send a super natural Angel to roll the stone away and that angel is here that angel is here can you say Amen because there's some other seed that's got to rise so all the all the darkness had gathered to kill out the light but you know what the prophet said light is 10 million times stronger than Darkness don't you sit in your Molly grubs as though the devil's got an upper hand on you you are a child of light and light is 10 million times stronger than the darkness you're going to make it everybody say I'm going to make it this church is going to make it it doesn't matter what the devil throws at this church this church is going to make it us preachers are going to make it this bride is going to make it you young people you're going to make it if you haven't listened to the message Rising on the sun you ought to go listen to it man I love this message I love the message that God sent us hello yes sir now notice what Jesus said because I live you shall live also ain't that right Amen brother BR said see we're beneficiaries of his resurrection see so then the word seed that had been planted in other words when he said You shall live also now we know we're living in a in a corruptible body amen we've got natural breath we're we we've got a life but that's not what he's talking about when he says you shall live he's looking at the seed that was PR destinated and put in you before the foundation of the world the prophet would call it a jean seed of God can you sayen and he's prophesying that there will come a time when that word seed that genan seed that had been laying pre dormant in your life is going to be quickened and brought to life you shall live also come on Church you shall live also it's in that seed there's nothing held against you you was always a child of God you was always the bride of Christ you were never defeated you was a conqueror you was Victorious and you shall live you shall live also Matthew 5:14 Jesus say you are the light of the world everybody now say it with me I am the light of the world don't just put it to A Jesus of 2,000 years ago I am the light of the world I am the light for this age come on Church don't you let the devil belittle your belittle you don't you let the devil put you down you tell that so Slew Foot I am the light of the world I am the light of the world and you will not stop me from manifesting the word of God this explains this explains then while the why the battle is Raging against us the darkness has gathered once again to put the light out you just happened to be in the age where God has promised that the word would come to full manifestation again you just happen to be the in the age where the word of God is to become flesh again and the Darkness is here amen waiting and resisting you fighting you that's why you can't go by feelings why you can't go by emotions that's right if you've ever received something from God to tell you you got the Holy Ghost you stay right there with that don't you let the devil talk you out of it you say well I fail amen that doesn't matter get back up we've even got scripture about that even though the righteous man falls seven times the Lord will raise him [Applause] up can you say Amen yes sir God's not looking at your flesh he's looking at the seed that he predestinated and put inside of you you realize God can't even look at you as a when he filled you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to the day of your Redemption Satan may be looking at you as a sinner but God will never he will never get God to look at you the way he looks at [Applause] you and that's true Satan may look at you as just a vagabond but he'll never get God to look at you that way H Hallelujah can you say amen I know I've said it here before I'll say it again remember the old uh remember the story of the uh the prodical son he was a son told his dad says you know i' he had to be a teenager Dad I know more than you do and I I know I know you think you know best but I got it all taken care of he said I want my I I I I want my inheritance the father bro heartbroken couldn't convince his son so he just gave him the inheritance we all know the story the sun went out and he wind and DED he lived it up stayed in the best rooms got him the best mule got him the best carriage had friends all around and he just lived it up [Music] but one day he ended up spending all of that inheritance ain't that right friends left he had to he had to sell you know or Pond or whatever we we call it in these days sell the mule sell the sell the nice Chariot sell amen he even probably had to sell his own the nice clothes that he had bought and the shoes he bought and all that and then he ends up in the hog pin and he's there eating the slop and the mud and and he's stinks like a hog and and I mean he couldn't even identify where he came from there he was starving he was just you know uh uh uh uh you know when it rained he was out there in the rain when it when the sun was beaten down he was right there with them he was muddy he was just miserable he was wretched he all of these things but he finally come to his senses enough to say you know my father's got it better and over where I you know over there I I I'm going to just go over there and and present myself and amen but notice what he said he he didn't approach him as though he was a son he says I would just go tell him I will be a servant I I'll just be happy to be a servant amen so no doubt he practiced his speech I'm just a servant I know I'm just no good I'm I'm I'm nothing I'm not even worthy to be called your son and and and these things you know and he just you know and all as long he's just a St you know trying to get there the hunger pains gnawing at his stomach and and he's just I'm just a servant I'm just a servant I'll just do anything just to get something to eat you don't even have to let me live in the house I'll just live in the quarters amen where the servants live I'll be treated as a servant I I'll be whatever see amen and and yet the Father the father had been waiting all this time looking for his [Applause] return father through ages ages looking for his [Applause] return and when he saw something glimpsing over the hill that little old frail weak figure maybe he got his his binoculars out the most expensive [Music] binoculars he didn't see a servant he saw a son and the Bible says he ran I'd like to say he ran with an open book to meet him Hallelujah ain't no mystery to the father now he's going to open it up to the son and here the son is saying oh oh I'm just unworthy I'm just no good and I'm just this and I'm just that but he could never convince the father of that and the father said oh my son has returned oh no just the servant I'm just and no doubt maybe the father had to slap him a little bit and Shake him a little bit and says you have never I don't see a servant you have never changed to be a servant you have always been my son you will always be my son that's all I see as a son can you say amen and the son had to live by what the father said about [Applause] him come on church amen the son didn't feel like a a son he felt like a servant but if the father said he was a son then he would act like a son he would live like a son he would be a son because the father said soall your bride your bride can you say amen God sent a prophet in this day and the word comes to a prophet and the prophet says I know longer call you church I call you bride that is straight from the father a mind of God you were predestinated in the mind of God to be sons of God Daughters of God a PR for Christ you may not feel like it but don't you go by your feelings live by what the father says about you live by what the word of the father says can you say Amen there's a whole Bible full of promises that the father says you will make it the father says you are victorious the father says you're mine can you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise if we are the light then that means we are the manifested word yes sir you believe that and the only way for that to happen is for the quickening power to come to us this is why the prophet said all that God was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ what is he poured into the church this why Paul would tell us the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory now notice and I'm going to hurry up now but Romans 811 if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you not another person third person in the godhead not a fifth person in the godhead but the same person that dwelt in that body of Jesus Christ if he dwell in you that God that quickened that body will Quicken your mortal [Applause] bodyall do you believe it now notice Jesus told us that there would come a day where that scripture would be made known to us if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body in other words see it would be made known there would be a day where that him dwelling in us would be made known right see the full reality of him living in US John 14:18 this is where Jesus prophesies I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day everybody say at that day you know what a prophet said this day can you say Amen what was it he came to us in quickening power in this day and at that day you shall know that I'm in my father you in me and I in you how we going to know that word Jean seed is quick [Applause] it would be a day when every promise that was given to the church would be quickened in us bringing the full word everybody say the full word to manifestation hello the spirit of him that was in Christ Jesus dwelling in you shall Quicken your mortal body brother Braham said just as your body is dead without the spirit so is the spir word of God dead without the Holy Ghost to Quicken it so the spirit quickens the body and the Holy Ghost quickens the word of God in other words Quicken means to bring to life make live it isn't just to give you Goosebumps it's to Quicken that Jean seed what God thought you to be before the foundation of the world he come to Quicken that seed you're not a beggar you're not just a nobody you're not just somebody that Satan can toy around with and play around with and ravish you and Destroy youl then you say Amen if you remember the seed that got planted on the day of Pentecost went into the ground at NAA the Dark Ages but God promised to restore the seed and to bring it into maturity do you believe that and according to Ezekiel the prophet there Ezekiel there would be four stages to this restoration amen but the full and complete restoration would be in the fourth stage which is the revealing of the son of man not another person but the same person not another Jesus but the same Jesus not another power but the same power not another life but the same life can you say amen that's right see amen and so therefore Hebrews 138 which was brother bram's theme scripture amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Luther's age did not bring the full restoration Wesley's age or the Pentecostal age did not bring it it would take the fourth stage to bring life Hallelujah brother R said the fourth stage is the fourth light which is the word itself the word made flesh everybody say the word made flesh it's the message of Life can you say Amen see in Ezekiel 37 7-10 the first stage the bones come together bone to his bone the second stage the sinu and and and the flesh Came Upon them the third stage the skin covered them and the fourth stage the breath came into them and they lived and stood up to their feet an exceeding great Army so brother Bram said see the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh yes sir you're not just a tight you're not just a shatter you're not just speaking of something to come you are that something to come it stops with you everything that Ruth Tau lived for and and lived about and testified of and and uh you know uh all of these others down through the Bible amen do you know there's more scripture that speaks of this day than there was the first time first coming of Jesus Christ can you say Amen see the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted set sanctification been planted the baptism of the Holy Ghost organ have died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid first line just ification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the coming of the cap what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away Hallelujah can you say [Applause] amen and all the powers of Darkness have gathered in this age the lid of hell has been lifted demonic powers are pouring in from everywhere the prophet said why to keep the light from coming forth young people you're part of this Rapture you're part of every promise that God promised understand that parents teach your children that they're part of the promise it's up to us ministers to wave the promises over the people keep waving them over the people don't look at their faults don't look at their failure look at the word of God and keep waving it over the people amen somebody's going to come to life I know it may be discouraging amen but there is light that is shining to Quicken the seed to bring life up keep waving the promises can you say amen he said see with this that can fit with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away see that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the House of God will live again and I say she's living this house of God is standing on her feet Hallelujah you believe it now the fourth stage could not happen if the first three stages did not come that's right see the life that was in the stock and in the tassel and in the husk all Gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stock went one to make the other justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made it way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down into Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself not manifest a Creed not manifest a Dogma all them other Ages were mixed in with breeds and Satan's lies and all of these but not this bride this is the word manifested again you are not a husk you are the word [Applause] seed Satan hates the fact you're here and he's doing everything everything he can to get you so twisted up in your mind to where you quit living what the father says about you and you start acting like a servant you start acting and conducting yourself as though you're just a sinner the prophet said you're not a sinner come on church if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost you cannot be a sinner again God didn't save you to lose you actually brother Bram said a Christian cannot even cross the line of Mercy can't even blaspheme that's right that's right well that's what he said can't even blaspheme and yet the biggest lie that Satan tells us is you've crossed the line there's no hope you've done it for the last time you know the fact that you did not cross the line is the fact you're here you got a desire to serve God shows that you hadn't crossed the line yet you got to tell that devil I'll never cross the line I'm in God's hands I am the prophecy I am the predestinated seed made flesh everything what God thought of his bride to be I am y stand toet to Toe with that Old [Applause] Devil quit quit acting backslid and just talk to the devil you know what come on come on you don't have to feel saved to win victories you know what I'm saying you don't have to feel saved just to talk to the devil that's right I don't think Jesus in the in the time of Temptation and out in the wilderness when he was hungry fasting right that he was just greatly inspired and just feeling like running all over the place but he knew the word enough yeah to not let the devil put him in a situation where he compromised on the word of God he knew enough of the word amen not to listen to The Devil's lies you may not feel anointed but speak the word anyhow you may not be on the mountain top but speak the word anyhow quit listening to the devil's life let the devil listen to you for a change can you say amen yes sir God gave you a message church God gave you the tapes God gave you a pastors to preach the message now put that message on your lips I Am The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ it's the light pressing but light is 10 million times stronger why because the light is the manifested word of God can you say Amen well do you love the Lord hallelujah hallu amen amen I love him now we're going to close amen but notice the fourth light is the evening light yes sir evening light that the prophet Isaiah said would come our Prophet said the evening light of Malachi 4 come shining through the darkness Amen to bring the evening light upon the predestinated word hallelujah see what's that fourth message to be what's that fourth Messenger to shine the light on the word oh yeah he shine light upon on this we wouldn't even know what the Bible said but while shining the light on this he shine the light on you because you're part of this this is written of you did not Jesus say search the scriptures for in this you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me he shined the light on the word now we can look at ourselves and behold not the glory of man but the glory of the [Applause] Lord to shine the light on the word the word is predestinated it has to come forth and something has to do it for God said I will restore sayith the Lord I will restore see the evening lights come shining through on that predestinated word now notice and at the opening of the seals another quote that at Revelations 10 the full word everybody say the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on the earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth Hebrews 13:8 can you say Amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so what is it it's the revealing of the son of man and the Darkness has gathered can you say Amen now the prophet told us the evening light is not any different than the morning light right it's the same light same Ministry same power same Authority brother R said he's the same in every detail except the the Corporal body that's right I'm going to close with this it's not the son of man in his physical body son of man not revealed in his physical body of 2,000 years ago but it's God revealed in a redeemed Body by manifesting his promised word yes sir now I made that statement you know the other day and a young man he was a little confused by it and he said you know what now I heard you say redeem body and he he said I'm sure you know I heard wrong or you uh or or you meant to say something different I said no sir I I I said right redeemed body he said but I said well I I know where you're thinking you're you know you're you're looking at redeemed body is when we're all changed and it's changed from corruption to incorruption and Mortal to immortality and and and all these things and yes that's that's the Final Redemption of the body can you say Amen but brother brandom said our soul our body and everything that we lost in the fall was redeemed when a public inside was raised at Calvary listen now when God wanted to appear before Abraham he didn't want to come as a spirit he needed a body but there was no body on the earth for him to come to so he had to speak one sir he took some dust blew now that's what a prophet said that's right and he he he done three bodies one for this Angel one for that angel and then he made himself one and there he appeared as a man human eating a calf drinking milk God made flesh can you say Amen so the prophet said he came came into that body in the person of MDC see now notice what he says he had to represent something he was going to be in the last days when he's looking to appear to Abraham he already had this day in his mind and he wanted to show then what he would be in this day so he comes right down down and talks in human flesh skip on further when it come time for him to come as a redeemer and a savior he needed the body he couldn't die as a spirit so he needed the body but there was no body that he could come to so there was a little Virgin by the name of Mary yeah that was just meditating upon the scriptures and it just happened she was meditating upon what Isaiah said For unto you a child shall be born his name Shall be Called Emmanuel and you know the story and and and God didn't have a body that he could come to so he created a blood cell in the womb of that virgin and that body began to grow inside her and God would look and say that's my body God waiting with anticipation to come down in that body can you say amen and in that body he redeemed Sons and Daughters of God can you say amen Church yes sir see so now in this day come on come on he needed to come down again for he promised that the son of man would be revealed and would show forth the same sign but he didn't have to create him a body he didn't have to get him a wound a virgin to borrow the womb to create his own body there was a body on Earth that he could come [Applause] to hello church we showed that Calvary worked everything that Christ did worked think of it now he didn't have to come into a word body he didn't have to come into a spoken word he could actually come into a sex born body and perform the same sign that he did in MDC now notice Revelations 1:5 says unto him that loved us this is the answer unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his his own blood can you say amen and brother Ram says that word watched is loosed he loosed us with his own [Music] blood brother Braham said if it is perfect blood that loosed us then it is a perfect loosening which means no sin held against you which means you are Justified [Applause] as though you never did it in the first [Applause] place talking about loose can you say Amen yes sir Hebrews 10:4 for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified can you say Amen yes sir brother Bram says a man or a woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and laid on him till that day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of fire and the chasm is bridged and never come into remembrance no more and a man stands Justified as a Son of God oh do you love him now we know brother brandham is not God we don't worship him as God it was God barring that body I wish I could go on I'm out of time God barring the body if you go listen to that rising of the sun brother Bram talked about a sheath wave sheath wave can you say Amen can I read it for just a moment the sheath wave brother brandham said see the waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath ain't that right in the Old Testament the sheath was was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripened you cut down this sheath and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your acceptance showing that you are accepted notice and they waved that sheath for it was the first one to come to maturity and it was waved as a memorial of thanks to God believing that the rest of them would come and brother brah says and the waving of the sheath was not on a Sabbath day as the other feasts it was waved on the first day of the week church I don't know about you but I believe that this message is their sheath wve for this age brother Braham said there must come another she wave yes sir can you say amen he said in the bride coming of Christ well he said he is to be waved again he was waved over the people on the day of Pentecost showing that he was that first one to come up he was the first true Son of God can you say amen and he was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come he is to be waved again we realize in this last day according to Luke 17:30 in this Sunday again in the day that the son of man will be revealed or waved again over the people in The Bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days for the first time there will come forth a message for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power being waved over the People by the SA signs and wonders that he did back there because I live you shall live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead and there's nothing that's going to keep you from coming Hallelujah can you lift your hands un the Lord as the musicians come do you love him let the darkness come but it can't Prevail do you see by the grace of God of why God brought you into this message you didn't stumble into this thing it was being waved over you bringing you to maturity bringing you to the manifestations of
