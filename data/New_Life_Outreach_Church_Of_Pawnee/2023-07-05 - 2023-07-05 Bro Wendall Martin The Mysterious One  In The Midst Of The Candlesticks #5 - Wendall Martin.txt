that we're living in amen I'm I'm so thankful for that I'm thankful man because it's going to require [Music] rapturing faith and rapturing faith can only come through perfect word and so we have to have a perfect confidence Amen in the word of the Lord in in order to trust him amen and that's what God is doing in in this in in this seventh age is unveiling himself in a in a greater light than ever before with Vindication greater before than before so that we can see who we are because we must make a rapture first stage didn't make it second age fifth age sixth age didn't didn't have the Rapture it was not according to the predestinated will of God Amen now they were looking for the Rapture because the mysteries of God had not been unveiled unto them yet so they all went down into the grave expecting that it was going to happen in their generation but it's in this age that God has come unveiled it all and said you're the people you're the ones and so we look to him for this unveiling aren't you glad for that amen I'm so thankful uh for for those promises and I and I enjoyed that song that that was sung here tonight amen and that's special that was wonderful [Applause] and that is an old song right there amen but um you can tell all the old ones they knew exactly I mean those uh those praise the Lord so that was wonderful and amen I wouldn't have known it I wasn't

questions um they always come up and ask questions or give comments on these Wednesday nights especially um they've been they've been really asking and and talking and and so we're glad for that as sometimes they're having a little bit of a hard time with the uh trying to get them to talk during the these Wednesday nights as well as we are trying some of the others and uh but uh um I'm not saying it was sister Stephanie amen but um we're but we I hope you all have been enjoying these these uh sun or these Wednesday nights where we just really slow down and and um and teach a little bit more and just really get into the simple things of the message here um but I want us to look here at Revelations one and um praise the lord we will look in here where we want to the eighth verse I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end saith the Lord which is which was which is to come the almighty God amen now that's now this is Jesus he's the personification of God now hi John who also am your brother and companion and tribulation in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seeest write in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus Myrna pergamus the Tyra Sardis Philadelphia and laodicea and I turned to see the voice that spake unto speak with me and being turned I saw the seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks was one likened the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as flame of fire his feet like undefined brass as they burn in a furnace his voice is the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword in his countenance was as the sun that shineth in his strength amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your blessings and and we appreciate your these songs and Lord the uh the special that was sung tonight and we're just asking the Lord that your Holy Spirit would be here with us in a real special way I pray Lord that that you would speak to us and just help all of our hearts and our minds to be sharp and and Lord let me be what you want say what you want me to say Lord and let us hear from you tonight and father you see brother Colby the Lord just not feeling well he's had a headache for a couple of days and and father I'm asking that you would touch him tonight that you would make him whole father I pray Lord that you would see brother Mitch that Lord fell and and the Lord he's already been having such problems with his legs and and father I I just pray that you would help him tonight and let him know that we all love him father strengthen him as our prayer just ask the Lord that you would always be with our elders Lord be with the Applegates there in Henrietta and and just be with all of our elders father we love you we give ourselves to you tonight in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening praise the Lord so we want to continue on with this mysterious one that is walking in the midst of the of the Furnace and amen or in in the midst of the candlesticks should I say and um now this the last the last Wednesday that we dealt with this we took a break this of course this last Wednesday night and so now here we are dealing with this with this um the 16th verse last week we dealt with uh you know his his um he had the the Seven Stars and tonight we want to deal with his mouth out of his mouth when a sharp two had sword and so as we went through the last uh the the last time we talked about the redeeming Lamb with the seven horns and seven eyes and so we dealt with some of the sevens of the Bible and how that seven is a is the number of completion and and so we we had dealt also a man of of two words that that um amen came from the same root word and that is the promise and seven so the swearing of an oath or the promise comes from the word Shabba and the Hebrew word for seven comes from Sheba and so they both derive from the same Hebrew word Saba amen and so this and it literally means satisfaction or fullness and so this is something when we look at the sevens of the Bible amen at the end of seven sabbaths seven sabbaths would would come the Year of Jubilee they would also take the priest would take the blood of the lamb and he would dip his finger into that blood and he would sprinkle it seven times on The Mercy Seat amen this would be this is speaking of completion amen so and it was it was dealing with the seven Church ages and how that there would be atoning blood for the entire church church period amen that would go from the time that Christ is caught up to the time that we are caught up amen so when from the time that Christ is caught up into the heavens and he says I'm going to come back and receive you up to me amen so the time that time to this time when we're caught up in Rapture then there are seven distinct periods of time now God divided them up into seven periods of time it's still the same church still the same bride still the same uh there's there's there's nothing different as far as specialness other than we are the ones that are going to uh uh be alive and remain amen but we're not but the you know the dead in Christ are going to rise amen and and we which are alive shall be caught up to meet them so so we've we've all been given the same promise the only thing is is in the last stage is when God is unveiling it all amen he's bringing it all out and he's saying okay this is what I've been doing this is what we should prepare for and look to and it's that word that is going to really spark rapturing Faith within our lives amen so so the so God put these in in in in distinct periods and and he and he separated him up into these seven periods so that you could look and see what God was doing right here in the in the first period in the second period in the third period all the way down so it's easy for a human mind to be able to comprehend ha I can see what God and what the Antichrist has been doing I can see what God's been doing to bring us back I mean he's understanding that so we're we're thankful for that and and and you see it's this is the unveiling of God's plan amen God has taken the cover off and letting us see things that they the the previous periods of time have not been able to see and so I I think it's a glorious thing and I believe as brother Branham says as the church wants the church finds out who she is the rapture will take place and that's why it's important for us to really do our homework and and not necessarily you know going to college or and to learn uh uh you know a Bible Seminary but to take the words of this prophet and really plant them deep into our hearts and say I believe what that Prophet taught us now if you're still wrestling with a prophet you know I you know I understand I was I was there at a at a certain point where I was trying to figure out and I amen but after a while and I and I kept searching out his words and I had to do that now I and you have to too especially if if you're coming from a denominational background amen all right man and I I would go back and I'd take what he said and I just gonna look through scripture then you know what I have found amen God's Prophet brought light to the scripture and I'm so thankful for the light that God has brought amen I'm very thankful Sue we're we're thankful for these amen for the blood of the Covenant we're thankful for the for the mercy we're thankful that God in in so many of these old place Old Testament places showed the sevens and and exactly how this would all take place and I'm glad tonight that there is an intercessor with the blood that is that is ready amen interceding for your Perfection there will come a time where the lamb amen will no longer uh uh uh intercede for you that he'll take up the role of the lion is that right now another thing I want us to always keep in mind and I've been bringing it out every time is we've got to always keep in mind that that uh uh Jesus is declaring his deity here in this book He's declaring now amen now you read the you you read Matthew Mark Luke and John amen and they talk a lot about his Humanity especially those first three Matthew Mark and Luke talks about the humanity of Christ whereas John begins to really bring in the deity how that the father is living within that body amen now cry taste is coming and of course the Apostle Paul in the book of Colossians in the book of Philippians in the book of Hebrews the the Apostle Paul takes especially those three books to really declare that this body the body of Jesus Christ has has been so exalted in the heavens amen it that that God has has given that body a name and in fact he becomes the very uh Jesus is the very fulfillment or the very manifestation the very uh image of the invisible God so God living in Christ so now when you look at Christ amen you are seeing the Redemptive work of God God needed a body to redeem he was always a savior he was always a redeemer but according to his own words and his own laws he had to become a Kinsman to you and you were a Kinsman in the in in the spirit you were made in the image of God so the word of God was here on the earth in a fallen body amen so God the great Eternal Word in order to redeem the Fallen words here had to come create a body move inside that body and do his redeeming work aren't you glad for that now there's too many people try to make uh you know they'll they'll take certain things and and as we said last week amen when it says there's seven spirits Before the Throne amen well you know you can you can't make seven you can't make seven gods it is God working in seven distinct periods with seven seers except can you say man amen the horns the seven horns were the uh uh were the lamb strength to stand there before that word and for that people and so we're thankful for that here tonight now uh uh another thing that we wanted to go back on just real quickly remember he had the Seven Stars in his right hand Amen in his right hand what does right mean the right hand is the is is a position of authority amen so when it's being he's my right hand man that means that man is is is is everything to that fella can you say Amen so amen when you say well she's my right hand man or he's my right hand that is talking of authority position one that is right there and so Christ is saying now he's got seven Messengers throughout these throughout these this period between the Rapture of Christ and the Rapture of the church that there's going to be seven distinct men with the eyes of God the lamps of God remember seven eyes seven lamps seven horns amen these were all declaring seven men with divine revelation to that church age y'all got that amen and so Hallelujah you swear I just don't know if I can trust brother Branham well I want to tell you I don't know if I can trust your opinion of brother Branham I trust God's opinion of brother branna because he said he's got the Seven Stars in his right hand amen so when those seven Messengers come you don't have to second-guess them you know when God vindicates them and God says they are mine Hallelujah all we have to do is say I believe it I believe it can you say amen and so so we're thankful for that amen so we've got the Seven Stars the seven eyes the seven lamps the seven horns talking about the anointing amen the Revelation given to in the Seven Stars were Earthly uh uh Messengers according to Revelations the first chapter Earthly Messengers and so it's these Spirits the seven spirits of God coming in and exhibiting himself in Earth a man upon the the Earth how many understands that now any questions on that any questions you kids y'all y'all got that amen so so when we look at these things they're symbols amen declaring just making it easy for us to be able to see what God's going to be doing so what church age are we in number seven we're in number seven amen how do I know because the Bible says in Revelation put that up Revelations uh 10 and 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound all of the mystery should be finished mystery of what mystery of redemption so our Prophet came to go back and to show where we have been all of these ages and I just want to say thank you Jesus amen so tonight we're going to deal with um out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and and so um and you know this may be uh uh repetitious of what we may know but I I just want I I want to go back through here and and this is not exhaustive but I'm I'm wanting to uh you know just take the next uh 30 40 minutes and into uh and and to deal with this so what connection does a sword and the mouth have now now this is sort of interesting why would there be a sharp sword come out of the mouth question amen why would a sword come out of the mouth anyone anyone got any any ideas to why praise the Lord amen huh I seen you amen huh the word the word that the God's word is a sword now so let's let's look because that that just makes a you think how in the world and where does this come from and so now let's just let's just stop for a moment let's just look at the word of God now is and once again I'm going to ask you all some more questions amen is this the word of God amen so was this Bible eternal so this is not the word of God this declares the word of God Hallelujah the Bible had a time that it was written the Bible has a time and we you know that little this this little thing right here will end the word is living the Living Word is not words on a page now this declares the word we believe that this is amen the infallible word of God true but God's desire has not been to write a Bible and say that's my masterpiece the the the Jesus was the word made flesh God's desire is for his bride to be word made flesh now although I agree you you answered correctly when you said is is this the word of God yes it is the word of God but the Bible itself the words on this page you can use all of every one of these words to write many books you there's been many books written using the same words that are on this page on these Pages can you say am I making sense so but the word the logos is the Living Word it's the Living Word of God now the Living Word of God is all-knowing because God is omniscient God is all-knowing God is all wise amen God's thoughts have existed with him throughout all eternity so God's thoughts you go back and think about God Amen Luke when did God come into existence huh Aaron when did God come into existence Hallelujah he has no beginning God has no beginning so he's he's been here for eons and eons and eons and eons and eons of time and his thoughts are just as eternal so God knew the the the start to the ending he knew it all eternally it was now it'll blow your mind because it's hard to really grasp this God has always known everything for eternity he's a living word hallelujah now we're just learning this and the prophets had a time that they spoke this but they were anointed by the logos or the living word amen are y'all catching that now so his thoughts have existed with him eternally amen he has known the end from the beginning nothing ever catches God by surprise sister uh Carol lupus has not caught God by surprise he's seen it for eons and eons and eons of time before that's why he provided amen that's the reason why he provided a lamb blood for each one of those ages he's provided that for us while he is bringing us through this Earthly Journey unto himself praise the Lord amen so so now God is Not Like the Wind God is not God's he's invisible that is true but he's not like the wind amen he's he's he's omnipresent but but he's it's not that God is present uh uh everywhere at all times God is a being God lives in a body and that body is in heaven everyone say God is a being he lives in a body and that body is in heaven Hallelujah so God is Not omnipresent everywhere at the same time except in his knowledge God is omnip omniscience in or God is omnipresent him that he is omniscient amen he is here because he is all-knowing praise the Lord can you say Amen now and so he is a bill a being that dwells in a house amen he's not at the the figment of your imagination he's not just the figment of someone else's imagination there is a real God living in a real body living in a real heaven brother Branham says there can't be a flea that uh that is I but what he noted he noted before there was a world how many times it bad its eye how much towel it had in it before there ever was a world that is infinite we can comprehend it in our minds but that's God God is infinite can you say Amen now uh so so now how many how many understands um and understands where I'm at so far amen so you kids understand that the invisible God is a being amen all right now brother brother Branham would tell us um uh he's got he's got several places here you know he he says he says it's just like he says now God in the beginning God dwelt all alone with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts uh that there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts and just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks he's he's going to build to create he cannot now he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it a different form because God is the only one that can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires and he says now it's a thought then he speaks it then it's a word a thought when it's expressed is a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought so it's it's God God's attributes then as it becomes a thought then it becomes a a word amen now he says now he says if he's if he isn't infinite he isn't God God has to be infinite we are finite he is infinite we he was omnipresent omniscient omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be God he knows all things all places because of his omnipresence omniscience makes him omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he's a being dwells in a house but being omniscient knowing all things makes him omnipresent because he knows everything that is going on now so now we find Christ we find this one this mysterious one in the in that is coming out and he's got he's got sward coming out of his mouth and so in other in in order to understand what this is we can understand that it's his word amen and that the word is all-knowing nothing happens but what he knows about what did Jesus say there in Matthew 10 and 29 and I tell you what I'm going to hold you you can you can just write that down but I'm just going to refer to it for now it says are not Two Sparrows so for a farting and one of them shall uh one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father amen annoying but but the very hairs of your head are all numbered he says fear not therefore ye are more valuable than the than the sparrow so he's saying God even knows all every one of your hair he knows everyone that falls out he knows every sparrow that falls from the sky he knows it all amen amen now Psalms uh 139 and 2 and we'll go ahead and turn there I think it's a good one for you kids to uh to Mark in your Bible praise the Lord any any comments anyone wants to make right now all right that's talking about the word the word is all-knowing so I want us to we got to get this thing settled down right now in our hearts the word is all knowing you're saying well I sure hope you get to the sword well we've got to find out what the word is first amen what's this nature of this word thou knowest if you've got a pen Mark that knowest thou knowest it's Psalms 139 and 2 my down sittings and uprising thou understandest right then Mark that understand us my thoughts are far off amen before I even get my thoughts together you already know thou compassest you can mark that word compasses my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways there is not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together that's a good one to underline thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high and I cannot attain to it wither shall I go from thy Spirit whether shall I flee from thy presence we're still talking about the all-knowing God if I Ascend up into heaven you are there if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shalt thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall uphold me can you say Amen if I say surely Darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light unto me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the knights shineth as the day and the Darkness and Light are both alike in other words God knows everything everything you might hide things from Mom and Dad but God knows everything you might hide things from your husband or wife God knows everything and we need to understand amen that that knowledge that God has that word we're fixing to see at the end those that that that Living Word is going to judge us someday it will become a sword of judgment to all of those who have lived hypocritical calling him God calling him Lord saying that and our hearts he knows everything can you say Amen so we we need to understand who we're dealing with this is not a religion this is a living God all right amen so this 12th verse he says or the 13th verse for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb let's just go ahead and finish him I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and thy and my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee When I Was Made In Secret and curiously rot in the lowest parts of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect why did you say that that word meant Mary do you remember that unperfect as uh as as of yet unformed was it something like that um she sent me a little something here a while back and I love that Thine Eyes did see my substance not being made or being yet unperfect and in thy book all my members are written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they're more than the number than sand when I awake I am still with thee so he is saying his knowledge is so incredible that he don't see he don't just see what you look like now he saw you in your mama's womb before you were ever even formed Hallelujah now uh we we've got sister Loretta's PR uh pregnant she's got a baby and and but the god already seen everything when it was just a little bitty seed he's already seeing the color of the hair he knows what that baby is going to look like what it's going to be like can you say Amen so so that that's the reason why if you look there in Isaiah let's look in Isaiah 46 and 9. and then we'll get we'll get on into my point amen Isaiah 46 and and nine and and it says I'll I'll wait for you there praise the Lord when you get there you can say Amen that Psalms Proverbs ecclesiastics Song of Solomon and then Isaiah praise the Lord it says remember the former things Abode for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the beginning from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure so here we got it this word this Living Word it's all-knowing it it's it's it pulsating with the life of God in it it's the logos it's the pillar of fire that is that Living Word and as we dealt with a couple of services ago did you know it's that logos that comes and moves on the inside of you through the Holy Ghost it's that same Pillar of Fire brother Brandon says that great light splits up and that cloven tongues of fire comes upon you to live his word through you well that should make you want to shout number two the word is a discerner amen Hebrews 12 or 4 and 12. amen and we have we have already been there so you should already have this marked in your Bibles but we'll still look at it again Hebrews 4 and 12. um mm-hmm are you there all right Hebrews 4 and 12 for the word of God is quick that means living and Powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword so now here we got the sword again piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints and moral and as a discerner of the thought and intent of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight for all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do now you've seen what they're saying the word and he whom we have to do it's the self-same thing God lives in his word now we say God lives in his word right here but again it's not that God is sitting on the shelf I am saying this simply tells us about the Living Word that he already is are y'all hearing me the prophets came to declare what God already is that's the reason why we hold this as God's infallible word and we refuse to argue with it amen because what has been spoke here is declaring who God really is is that right that's why we honor this amen but I promise I promise you when the Rapture takes place this is going to be left on the Shelf you will be the one that is caught up we're wanting this to become this right here are y'all understanding so so we're not I'm not don't don't misunderstand me this is because I don't want to say huh brother Wendell saying that this Bible isn't isn't isn't the infallible word of God it is it's declaring who he is but there's there's no life pulsating from this book well thank goodness every denomination uses the same Bible but this mysterious one is not Pages this mysterious one is living amen praise the Lord so he's a discerner he's a discerner God is a discerner he knows what you're thinking he knows he knows where your problems are is that right how many remembers of the story there and you can write this down in your devotions everyone would enjoy it but they're in in Second Kings the sixth chapter around the eighth verse the king of Syria is uh you know he's coming to war against Israel and um and so he takes his counsel with his with his soldiers and his men and he says hey this is what we're going to do I want you all to go down there we're going to do this and this and this it's such and such a place and and uh amen and then God that great that great logos would would that was upon the prophet would would go he would go the prophet would go to the king and the king would and it would tell him uh he he says in he says the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not in such and such place for thither the syrians are coming down and the king of Israel sent to the place which was which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once or twice every time every time the Syrian Army would get there every time the Syrian Army would get there the guy the other guys were already ready and Israel was winning the battles and finally the Bible says that that the king of Syria called all of his guys together and says we've got a traitor Among Us that is telling my secrets to Israel and finally one of the guys lifts his hand and says King it's it's not it's not us there's a prophet over there that knows yours the secrets in your bet chamber this guy knows everything that you're doing can you say Amen it was the Living Word that Pillar of Fire that was with Israel was declaring the secrets Hallelujah listen if you if if you've got the pillar of fire on your side amen you're a blessed man right and I say we've got the pillar of fire on our side the god of Secrets is giving secrets to his people Discerning well praise the Lord and so we're we're thankful for that now I want us to look again amen so number three is that that word god anointed His prophets with amen now we understand that the scripture told us uh uh they're in Deuteronomy it and and it says that uh uh matter of fact let's just look there Deuteronomy the 18th chapter and um 18 and 15. and that's the fifth book in the Bible for you younggins praise the Lord when you get there you can say Amen all right it says the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of Thee and of thy Brethren liken to me unto him ye shall hearken according to all that thou desirest of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of God neither let me see this great fire anymore that I die not and the Lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken I will raise them up a prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words now now listen here he's saying now I'm going to raise up a prophet and when he talks and you ain't listening to my words that I've given him look what he says um he says I that he shall speak in my name I will require it of him amen it says but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die so now this is important so here comes a prophet saying God told me thus and thus and thus and thus then if it doesn't line up with what the other prophets have already said and if it and and what he says doesn't come to pass that Prophet shall what and it wasn't that God was going to strike him dead they were to all gather they would all find that man and stone him that's that Prophet had to die that's that was that was listen you didn't mess around with God's word oh I wonder what God would think about this generation today with all these preachers going around and they're all claiming the same Bible and they're saying you can be homosexual they say you can be transgender they say that you can and it don't matter that God you don't you know you can dress however you want to dress you can do whatever you want to do and the Bible's already said that homosexual is wrong wearing man's girls wearing man's apparels wrong and a preacher if he comes in and preaches anything contrary than what the prophets before us has already said in the Bible days what would be happening they would be pronounced to death oh there'd be a lot of preachers dying today amen there'd be a lot of preachers so so we we want to do that now so then the Bible says the 21st verse if thou say in your heart how shall we know what is the word which the Lord hath not spoken and here he tells so he's asking now if you're wanting to know well how do I know what's right and what's wrong how do I know which prophet to listen to what what am I supposed to do he's just told us that since you asked you said let not God speak to us less lest we die because we're scared the the great Pillar of Fire and the thunderings we don't want you speaking anymore send us a prophet he says all right I'll raise up a prophet but if you don't listen to that prophet then you will have to answer because that Prophet has the Living Word the discerner of the heart he's the one that has it all and one day his words will become a sword to you amen now I want you to listen he's going to say now how do I know what's right and what's wrong 22nd verse when a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord and if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet had spoken presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him so if a prophet prophesies and it comes to pass that is God speaking through that Prophet it's that Living Word listen folks if that great Pillar of Fire comes down to a prophet the all-knowing God can give details addresses can tell what you ate this morning can tell what you're going to do tomorrow morning that logos that knows all things endlessly is the one that talks to the prophets so you got to profit that there and God and he can't he's just guessing around all the time you can know that the pillar of fire has not appeared to him amen all right so so that this is because this is something that we want to know now so it's good it's good to know that's the reason why we're not just listening and uh how why do we believe brother Brandon to be a prophet because the pillar of fire or God's promised in the Bible that he would come the pillar of fire came down in this day and prophecy after prophecy after prophecy showed that God was with brother Branham and yet god brother Branham did not use that for a following amen he says if you love me love the Bible amen so brother Branham taught us to go back to the Bible and to believe it the way God wrote it amen so so that's what we're doing now all right so and and now a prophet is a special man no you you can't call yourself a prophetess I can't call myself a prophet it's not anyone who claims to be a prophet the Bible says they're in to Jeremiah uh and and you can write this down because we don't have time to keep looking at scripture here but Jeremiah 1 and 4 amen and through 10 it says Jeremiah before I fall v i ordained thee to be a prophet amen the specially built men as first Samuel 3 and 19 write it down it says and Samuel grew and the Lord was with him and did not let none did let none of his words fall to the ground amen so a prophet is a specially built man now so we we find that Jesus was the prophet of prophets he was the god prophet in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God he was the light the light of men and it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen so the word of words the prophet God the logos was now living bodily fully completely amen all the godhead of God was living in that body of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah and he is the image of the invisible God now so this now how many how many is following me so far now the beautiful part is the son of man is to be revealed there's been special prophecy that that logos Prophet God would be revealed to us in this seventh Church age right before Jesus comes now now this is this is especially important and especially as we're dealing with out of his mouth comes as sharp two-edged sword because uh remember the prophet God is a discerner he's all-knowing and he can he can foretell when he says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in our day amen what was it Prophet God coming in a body and Discerning he was telling Abram that Sodom is fixing to burn he was also telling Abram that Sarah is has been waiting on a child so he knows her past he also tells Abram or Abraham that she is going to have that child according to the time of life so it is a prophet standing there in front of Abraham reading their past telling them their future and then also saying that Sodom is fixing to be destroyed and the Bible says he would send us the son of man the he says in the revealing this would be the logos coming so personal in this day to declare the end time signs show us what we have been waiting on where the church Ages come and also declare what our future is hallelujah amen now now this is this is good because when brother Branham in the opening of the seals brother random was torn up and so he was saying man am I going to die with the vision and I I just don't see how I can miss it and what did God do when he went up to the when he went up to the canyon and he was he was Sabina Canyon then he was praying and it had his hands up in the air and he and he's saying Lord my heart is so troubled this Vision it showed it showed seven dots from the sky coming down and as they come in to me they were the Angels they picked me up there was an explosion all of this stuff was going on and he's and and he says I don't understand this and he went and told the church three or four months before it actually happened he goes up to the church and he tells him is this the time end times sir is this the sign of the end and and and you kids you kids would enjoy it I think every one of us would would enjoy going back and listening and he's asking what does this mean am I going to die does this mean that that that there's that there's another messenger coming this is he's asking the questions and and so he he he's saying I believe it has something to do with those seven or no Thunders and so he says is this the time for this to happen well he's there in Sabina Canyon or he's over in Arizona and he and he's and he's hunting and and um and and and just like the vision it said he had already forgot about the vision but they were out there looking for for for Hogs and hunting with some other brothers and um and so as he was as he saw some Hogs uh going around this Canyon here he he had stopped to take a break and he had pulled a little a little a burr Little Bull header off of his trousers her his pants and as he threw it down and as he as he threw it down there was this great explosion just exactly like the vision said what happened it would Justice and brother Branham had already told us three months earlier that this was going to happen but he thought that he might die and so so here it came and and and uh ma'am the it he says he says it rocks the canyon I mean a big old explosion these angels swept down picked him up and says go back to Jeffersonville for the opening of those Seven Seals okay well so brother Brandon was asking now what what is all of this what is all of this about so he's up there at the canyon up to Sabina he's got his hands up in there and he's saying Lord what is what does all of this mean what's going on and all of a sudden a sword appears in his hand the sword he's he's looking at this sword and he says he's sort of scared of a sword and um and maybe I've and maybe I've got it here um praise the Lord he says um he says that someone went West wondering what was going to happen one day I got a call from the Lord and I told my wife I said honey I'm probably my work is over I don't I he says I didn't know God has probably finished with me now I'll be going home you you go get with Billy and take the children God will make make a way for for you somehow and go on and just live true to God see that the children get their school through school and raise them in the admonition of God she said bill you don't know that that's true he said no or I said no but but a man couldn't survive that one morning the Lord woke me up and said get up there Sabina Canyon and I took a piece of paper in my Bible and the wife said where are you going I said I don't know I I'll tell you when I come back I went up in the canyon climbed plumb up where the Eagles was flying around and I was watching some deer standing there and I knelt down to pray raised up my hands and a sword struck my hand and I looked around and I thought what's that I'm not beside myself I here here is that sword in my hand bright shiny glistening in the sun I said there's not people in in miles of me yeah way up here in this Canyon where could that come from and a voice said that's the king sword and I said a king nights a man with a sword and he The Voice came back and said not eat not a king sword but the king's sword the word of the Lord he said fear not it's only the third pool it's the Vindication of your ministry amen now amen so he's now he's saying he's showing us now now we're getting to to to out of his mouth comes a sharp to Ed's sword now the word of God has always been spoke All Through The Seven Ages we are all built upon the word of the Lord Seven seers giving the Revelation for each of those seven periods but it's the seventh one that was declared that the mystery would be finished they didn't know the story they didn't know what what it was all about they were just simply following the the the the the spirit of the Lord for their age but we are the consummation of it all y'all understand so God raised up brother Branham he raised up brother Branham to bring the word to its completion in our hearts so that we can understand what he's been doing why why would God do that to us any of you young people why would God do that to us and not the others any guesses amen old people huh well for the elect but so were The Seven Ages they were the elect huh it is the final age yeah we're that final age so he's kept the cover over the Masterpiece you're not the only one part of the Masterpiece Seven Ages his Masterpiece is the church the Redemption we are part of the church we're no better than the others that than the Apostle Paul or the fifth age or any other where but we are the privileged ones that God unveils himself to to show what his plan has been the whole time huh that's right we are that fullness of time that was to come so he put it he put it in Mysteries and symbols if God didn't put those in Mysteries and symbols and if everyone knew if God had showed at the beginning okay there's going to be 2 000 years there's going to be seven Church ages there's going to be 2 000 years there's going to be a lot of trouble a lot of Heartache that's going but the Rapture is not going to take place until the very last brother Branham says all of these others would have died just thinking well it's not for our day but the way it was everyone was expecting the coming of the Lord for their day their day they died in anticipation and they had to die in anticipation because it was that anticipation or that faith that would raise them up with us at the last is that right so here we stand today amen with this Word of Promise now you say now what does this what what does this really do for me well brother Branham after the opening of the seals he began to say things like this he says I want I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking the seventh angel which is the messenger of the seventh seal his message and he says and the revelations 10 was the seventh seal he says on another place he says now the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 is the last message to the last Church age which fulfills exactly Revelation 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed now that might not mean a lot to it might not you know for a lot of might think well I don't understand that what he's doing is he's going back and pointing it to scripture that this is a prophecy this is a prophecy this is a prophecy and he's wanting you to catch what this sword means he's want you to see it amen now he says the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come took the book out of the right hand of him sat down and claimed what he owed uh what he owned what he had redeemed it's always been that third pool now three is perfection the ministry came to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural among human beings as was predicted in the days of Sodom in the days of lot he says I've Got My Mind Set On this message that's that third pool and what was that third pool that was that great sword he says that's the one I must be loyal and reverent to amen now what what is God doing Hallelujah the son of man the king's sword so we're finding the word the discerner we've got these here that are standing now we're we're linking the the message of our day to a sword he's standing in there this mysterious one when he opens his mouth amen out of his mouth comes a sharp two-edged sword y'all remember what we've done the last time out of his mouth was The Voice of many Waters what did we find the many Waters was what was the mini Waters it was the word of God being preached throughout the entire Seven Ages those were the seven seers those were the preachers and that was the bride that was living out the word of God in their day are you understanding so now let's put it all together let's put it together here is The Living Voices of all of the ages here is the seventh Church with a with a sword in their mouth declaring the mystery of God declaring through faith I believe that promise now all right now uh now y'all's been awfully quiet here tonight amen uh are you understanding what I'm saying or no any questions now make sure on these Wednesday nights follow the hand up or say something you're welcome to do so praise the Lord Ephesians 6 and 17. part of the armor of God he says let me get to it here it says and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is what right now here we go and I'm closing this this is my last point what good was this what is this message it's the sword what is the word it's the sword of the spirit what does this why is it important for us to have this understanding today because perfect word brings perfect faith hallelujah amen we've got we're going to defeat Devils that the other ages never did could defeat what is the last one that the Apostle Paul says that is still haunting everybody death death but this word is greater than death this is God saying listen I've saved this last not to puffy up to say well I'm a message believer I follow brother Branham but we're to take that message that is God's that is God Hallelujah in other words it's God unlocking the gun cabinet amen and inside the gun cabinet is the rifle and the bullets and you can go out there amen and and and and get your game or get what can you say man and and this is this is what what God is saying I'm giving you what it takes to defeat the enemy of your soul amen amen defeat the enemy of your soul so now now catch that Hallelujah he's going you you are you you're taking that sword of the spirit so why why was it now remember a lot of people put that in that seventh seal that sword that that that third pool all on brother Branham but remember when he unveiled when he unveiled the book then it was a command that you go pick up that sword you go take the book you eat the book because you must speak you are now speaking amen the sword of the spirit the word of God is in you is that right now those who have who have rejected that of course the Bible says that they might he says you you they'll be God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my uh according to my gospel amen brother uh the god there to the those that were holding the nicolaitanism in the Third Church age there in Revelations 2 and 16. it says repent or I will come unto thee quickly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth amen so you're either for him or you're against him is that right and so when he stands as judge he's going to he's he's going to judge the World by this message that has been brought to us he's going to judge the secrets of man according to this gospel is that right amen so the great Living Word will be there on that day amen I'm just a voice I'm an Earthly voice I'm a pastor I can only speak as I hear from him as I read it in his book as I listen to the seventh angel but the logos that has put the plan together he's ever living and he's here in our church he's here in our services he's here in our homes he's everywhere amen and he anoints us as we take this message he anoints that word he anoints it to our heart and we defeat the Devil we defeat cancer we defeat lupus we we defeat sin in our lives it's the Living Word are y'all hearing me it's that word that comes living through us that's why God sent us a prophet pointing to these and saying believe this put these on your lips amen Hallelujah well glory to God so the scripture says and musicians could come the scripture says they're in Revelations 19 that when he comes Amen on that on riding on the riding on the White Horse he's going to come with the word of whether with a sword out of his mouth and he's coming for judgment then but if you look there's also the armies going wide horses too that's you and me and we got swords too we've taken the word of the Lord and we defeat the enemy I'm so thankful for that today amen oh I love him do you do you love him with all of your heart amen all right so so any questions on what I've said here tonight amen any anything at all that that maybe I've I've left out for in that someone might think that I've left a little bit of confusion in or anything you want to add to this remember Wednesday nights amen is is just just easy nights for whoever to say whatever amen Bible study type deal praise the Lord [Music] behind Christ why would be they're already just he laid his body down his body yeah well but but we are that the Judgment has come this this this truly what is taking place right now is the fulfilling what I preached tonight is the fulfilling of Revelations 12. they he says and they when Satan was cast down he had a short time on Earth and he's a key the accuser of their Brethren is here he says but they over they love not their life unto death and they overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony so we are literally judging him now and what we understand when after this battle is over and we're caught up there is there is no more there there is there is no more of us having to answer uh uh because our sins have all been dealt with we will be judging the the serpent we when we when we come back now there will be a time now according to the teachings of Paul and the Book of Revelations that I I believe that there will be the rewards given it'll be the bank the banquet hall but that that is not um the Judgment seat I I believe the rewards are going to be there in that in that Thousand-Year honeymoon yeah no no no no no no no there's no judgment no no and the scripture is pretty uh it's pretty clear on it that the Apostle Paul says it's it's there's you're we're judged here by the gospel now and and when we get to it and then the rest of the Dead live not again for a thousand years after after the honeymoon then is when great and small and that's when we're not even in that part of it at all where but brother Bradham says they're in Revelation or in Matthew um 25 where he's talking about giving the um uh uh separating as a Shepherd the sheep and the goats he says now remember he says as a Shepherd this is not the shepherd this has nothing to do with the elect we have already we we are there with him this is at the second Reser or this is at the second judgment the second Resurrection should I say and so this is when he's he's he's talking to the foolish virgins he's talking to the uh those that have been good to the bride that is what Matthew 25 is dealing with some if you don't if you don't listen uh you know if you don't take that in account according to what brother Branham and again it took it took a prophet to bring that out to us and so a lot of people look at that and say well well here we are at the second Resurrection you know the Sheep are being no no it has nothing to do that has nothing to do with the bride that that judgment does that make sense for everybody yes that's right that's right that word is taking us we are we are submitting ourselves to that word right now and defeating the devil in our lives that's why we must fight fight that devil amen amen any other questions praise the Lord all right amen we sure love everyone here and um and we love sister Katrina she's going to be having her birthday tomorrow thank you so um Kevin's whoa happy birthday brother Kevin well let's sing let's sing Happy Birthday to
