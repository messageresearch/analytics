[38:10] YouTube or however and and listen to
[38:14] last Wednesday night's message
[38:16] amen
[38:18] um I guess some I felt like the the Lord
[38:21] was in it and it was a
[38:24] I feel like there's some things that
[38:25] that we can use every one of us could
[38:28] use some of those principles but
[38:30] especially with our children and
[38:33] um man so we're going to
[38:37] um Minister here this evening on along
[38:39] the same lines training our children for
[38:42] Ministry
[38:44] but I'm wondering if the Lord will help
[38:46] me to to
[38:49] um bring the importance of stopping the
[38:53] generational curses
[38:55] stopping those curses amen so that our
[38:58] children can live free how many believes
[39:01] that we can we can teach our children to
[39:04] live free
[39:06] they don't have to be bound by the
[39:08] things that we have had in our lives
[39:11] amen and so it's it's an incredible
[39:15] thing I uh been Josh and Laurette has
[39:19] been staying with us and and while he's
[39:22] uh working on their house and and uh
[39:25] just watching Loretta and the baby
[39:29] interact together and and and the songs
[39:32] that this that this that that this young
[39:36] and can sing and and oh Howie sings and
[39:40] preaches and plays his guitar and what
[39:45] an opportunity we are giving what a
[39:48] privilege a two-year-old child already
[39:51] knowing the songs already trying to
[39:55] preach he's got to have a Pulpit and
[39:57] he's got to have him a guitar and and I
[40:00] think how blessed we are in this Godless
[40:03] world
[40:05] to raise children
[40:07] sane
[40:09] amen that's what that's our desire is to
[40:12] raise sane children now sometimes you
[40:15] might not think they're so sane amen but
[40:18] but I believe I believe that we're
[40:20] raising sane children praise the Lord
[40:22] amen let's let's go to the Lord in
[40:25] prayer before we read father we're
[40:27] asking that you would be with us here

[41:17] others and we're so excited and so
[41:20] thankful for that
[41:21] the Lord we come to you now and we give
[41:24] ourselves to you in Jesus name we pray
[41:27] can the Church Say Amen
[41:29] and amen God bless you let's look here
[41:32] at John 17 and 21.
[41:35] that they all may be one
[41:39] as thou father art in me and I in thee
[41:44] and that they also may be one in US
[41:49] that the world may believe that thou has
[41:53] sent me so now let them be one
[41:56] and and as thou father art in me and I
[42:00] in thee that they may be one in us with
[42:04] the end goal with the end goal that the
[42:07] world I'm talking about raising Ministry
[42:10] I'm talking about raising children for
[42:12] Ministry that the world may believe that
[42:16] thou has sent me and the glory which
[42:19] thou gavest me have I given them that
[42:24] they may be one even as we are one I am
[42:27] them thou and me that they may be
[42:31] perfect in one that the world may know
[42:34] that thou has sent me and has loved them
[42:38] as thou Hast loved me now we want to say
[42:42] oh oh God so love Jesus loved them
[42:47] talking about you and me as God loved
[42:51] Jesus God bless you you can be seated
[42:54] here tonight
[42:56] amen father thou Hast loved them
[43:00] I I think we've got to we
[43:04] we've got to come to grips
[43:06] sooner or later that we are loved of God
[43:12] you're never going to be a good Minister
[43:14] as long as you are the one that's
[43:17] needing ministering too
[43:19] and we've got too many people amen that
[43:23] have totally mistaken the body of Christ
[43:27] for amen as as if it is uh just a couple
[43:32] of singers a couple of preachers a
[43:34] couple of musicians and then the rest of
[43:36] us are all entertained no we are a body
[43:41] and we Minister one to another amen so
[43:46] you are loved of God just as much as the
[43:51] sinless body of Jesus Christ was loved
[43:56] by the father amen now that'll make your
[43:59] head spin if you really think about it
[44:01] and if you really believe it it will it
[44:05] will settle your heart forever that I am
[44:09] loved
[44:11] I am luck you see we're all born in this
[44:14] world with a sin with a love deficiency
[44:18] amen we didn't come in this world with
[44:22] uh uh in Perfection amen so when we when
[44:26] we come we've got to understand that we
[44:30] are loved by God we all need to be loved
[44:34] we all want to be loved and I want to
[44:38] say that you were in Christ you are
[44:41] loved at the same time that Christ was
[44:43] loved you were loved when God seen
[44:46] Christ before the foundation of the
[44:48] world you were chosen in him so every
[44:51] time you look at Christ you see yourself
[44:54] and it should be a perfect expression of
[44:57] that Divine love the Apostle Paul amen
[45:01] says they're in Galatians 2 and 20. I am
[45:04] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[45:07] live yet not I but Christ lives in me
[45:10] and the life which I now live not the
[45:14] old life but the life which I now live
[45:17] in the flesh I live by the faith of the
[45:21] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[45:26] for me now I want you to look at three
[45:28] things there amen life
[45:31] faith and love amen the life I now live
[45:36] is by the faith of the Son of God Who
[45:40] Loved Me
[45:43] Hallelujah so so service
[45:46] comes from being loved ourselves you
[45:51] cannot give unless you have unless not
[45:55] you have it to give can you say man and
[45:58] God don't want us just living and and we
[46:00] don't want our children just living Amen
[46:03] in a mixed up mindset remember Satan
[46:06] comes to kill to steal and destroy amen
[46:10] but Jesus says I am come that they might
[46:13] have life and that they might have life
[46:17] more abundantly
[46:19] so he doesn't want us just to live Amen
[46:22] in a messed up way he wants us to live
[46:26] in peace
[46:27] Joy happiness amen he wants that within
[46:32] our hearts can you say Amen every one of
[46:34] us listen if everyone in this building
[46:36] God wants you to live a life of
[46:40] contentment
[46:41] he wants you to be happy with what he's
[46:44] made you to be he wants you to be happy
[46:47] with the color of your hair he wants you
[46:49] to be happy with your personality he
[46:52] wants you to be happy with your friends
[46:54] God wants you to be content in him well
[46:58] praise the Lord amen we should have
[47:01] contentment in our homes amen the the
[47:03] now now listen the the environment that
[47:06] the child grows up in plays a major role
[47:11] in the molding of that character with
[47:14] within uh and the personality within
[47:18] that child amen so our our home our
[47:22] family the environment should be
[47:25] soothing it it should be upbeat it
[47:28] should be happy it should be peaceful
[47:31] well praise the Lord even in this even
[47:34] in this society today amen love should
[47:38] be in the home brother Branham says then
[47:39] what type of people ought we to be if if
[47:42] we're a Christian what type of an
[47:44] atmosphere should we live in in a
[47:46] consoling soothing healing atmosphere we
[47:50] should live in with our hearts
[47:52] constantly in prayer and with deep love
[47:55] for every person we come in contact with
[47:59] so so how are we going to give the love
[48:03] unless we have a heart that is soothing
[48:06] that is peaceful that is content amen
[48:10] that that is consoling that is healing
[48:14] you can't love everyone you come in
[48:16] contact with if in your heart it it's in
[48:21] a constant struggle all the time and
[48:24] that's where we as as Christians need to
[48:27] get serious with God and and and and and
[48:31] get a many times we're still needing
[48:34] conversions we're still needing the Holy
[48:36] Ghost to come because amen love joy and
[48:40] peace comes by the Holy Ghost
[48:44] can you say amen that's what that's what
[48:46] he said love joy and peace in the Holy
[48:48] Ghost so so how do we share the these
[48:53] this deep love for everyone you come in
[48:55] contact with now this is a good question
[48:57] how can I share this deep love that
[49:01] brother Branham says that I need to be
[49:02] sharing amen now remember the child is
[49:06] going to mirror you and the way you see
[49:09] things
[49:10] amen hallelujah you're watching a little
[49:12] leaf and just follow his mama around and
[49:15] amen and he's just so content you know
[49:18] and and and she is training him right
[49:22] there training him on the spot you Mamas
[49:24] are training your children
[49:26] praise the Lord now so how are you
[49:30] training them well for your children you
[49:33] enter into Fellowship where where you're
[49:35] where they live amen by expressing deep
[49:39] expressions of love for them amen you
[49:42] share in their Joys you you rejoice in
[49:45] their triumphs you they man you're
[49:48] you're you're you're you're there to cry
[49:50] with them or to help them or to console
[49:52] them you're you're you're there you are
[49:54] God to those people or or to that child
[49:58] you are God you are you are expressing
[50:01] his love to that to your children can
[50:04] you say man
[50:05] the reason why you should never tell
[50:06] your joy you're so stupid oh you're just
[50:08] I just if I tell you all the time why
[50:11] don't you ever learn no no no no no no
[50:13] no no don't plant your don't build a
[50:17] complex in that child amen remember the
[50:21] child comes a blank canvas your children
[50:25] are blank canvases when they come from
[50:28] the cradle and what you allow in your
[50:32] home is what they are going to be now
[50:35] you might be saying well my child is
[50:37] eight years old 10 years older Oh my he
[50:40] may be or she may be a reflection of the
[50:43] turbulence in the home and and we've got
[50:45] to now I'm not saying it we we don't
[50:48] live listen we live in a fast and busy
[50:50] paced world but but but
[50:54] in everything we do we're doing it in
[50:57] the nature of love
[51:00] how do I express that how do I teach my
[51:04] children you can't sit down and teach

[51:21] you when they make a mistake you correct
[51:24] them but you're also loving them you're
[51:26] showing them what can you say man but
[51:29] another way that I feel is is so

[55:28] now if you're not active in the body
[55:31] that God has placed you in and you're
[55:34] setting off to the side then you're
[55:37] going to be longing you're going to be
[55:40] craving you're going to be wanting
[55:44] because you're not actively involved in
[55:48] the body
[55:50] you're a spectator and you want to be oh
[55:54] oh
[55:56] what's wrong with me you've got to be
[55:59] baptized into the body of Christ and

[56:53] now if you don't show up to church at
[56:55] the time or if you're not if you're not
[56:57] trying to be a friend to somebody else
[57:00] if you're not trying to then you are you
[57:03] you have separated yourself from the
[57:06] body
[57:09] praise the Lord you've got to be a part
[57:13] of the body
[57:15] you will never
[57:17] fulfill this until you do your part in
[57:23] the body of Jesus Christ
[57:25] we all have a part
[57:29] Hallelujah can you say Amen so so that
[57:32] the scripture says they're in Ephesians
[57:33] 4 and 16. from whom the whole body fitly
[57:37] joined together and compacted by every
[57:41] joint by that which every joint
[57:43] supplyeth according to the effectual
[57:47] working in the measure of every part
[57:50] listen to this maketh increase of the
[57:54] body unto the edifying of itself in love
[58:01] wow now when a child can see that in the
[58:07] parents
[58:09] it becomes
[58:10] it becomes a routine it becomes it
[58:14] becomes a motion something that has set
[58:17] into motion now I must say love is not a
[58:22] teaching
[58:23] love is not a sermon
[58:25] love is nature
[58:29] Hallelujah amen love is nature Love Is
[58:35] God God is love
[58:38] so in order in order to love then you
[58:43] have got to have amen you've you've got
[58:46] to have the Holy Spirit well praise the
[58:48] Lord amen let me let me find that uh uh
[58:52] a couple of scriptures on that praise
[58:54] the Lord you love him
[58:56] amen praise the Lord now I I've said in
[59:00] the past love is an act of your will
[59:03] and it is
[59:05] but you can't will yourself to love
[59:08] you can't make yourself love
[59:12] that's what the world is missing is love
[59:15] so it's not it's not in your will
[59:17] love is God
[59:20] and when we get that New Birth then we
[59:25] only then can we be a minister praise
[59:29] the Lord amen because remember God is
[59:31] love the whole being of God is love he's
[59:34] the source and the Fountain of all love

[1:01:47] still living
[1:01:48] it's life but it's not Abundant Life
[1:01:52] and sometimes you've got to go to the
[1:01:54] doctor
[1:01:56] find out what's wrong
[1:01:59] so that he can fill you up with some
[1:02:02] iron
[1:02:04] and when you get your iron back
[1:02:07] then all of a sudden you're oh you're
[1:02:09] not weak anymore
[1:02:11] you can think properly you can act
[1:02:14] properly you can why because you were
[1:02:16] low on iron
[1:02:19] well praise the Lord
[1:02:22] and and tonight I think there's I think
[1:02:24] there's a great need brother Branham
[1:02:25] says there's a great need for love in
[1:02:28] the body of Christ a love now now that
[1:02:32] anemic person you see complexes come
[1:02:35] because of the lack of love
[1:02:39] now
[1:02:41] if if this if this is representing God
[1:02:45] who is the source of all love
[1:02:48] and when he fills you with the Holy
[1:02:50] Ghost and I didn't get to my scripture
[1:02:52] over there let me get to the scripture
[1:02:53] real quick Hallelujah
[1:02:56] amen
[1:02:57] let me see here Romans Romans 5 and 5
[1:03:02] and hope maketh not a shame
[1:03:05] because the love of God is shared abroad
[1:03:11] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:03:14] given to us
[1:03:16] so God's Jesus says I want the church to
[1:03:21] know that that I that they are loved as
[1:03:27] much as I am loved all of God dwelt
[1:03:30] right here keep it up there such Keys
[1:03:33] all of God dwelt in the body of Jesus
[1:03:36] Christ amen all of them but he's saying
[1:03:39] I want you to know
[1:03:42] that you are loved just as much as I am
[1:03:47] loved
[1:03:49] God thinks a lot of me the father has
[1:03:53] Vindicated me glorified me
[1:03:56] but he says listen you've got a hope
[1:03:59] and it doesn't make you ashamed
[1:04:02] because the love of God is poured into
[1:04:06] your hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:04:10] given to us
[1:04:13] how do you get love
[1:04:18] how do you get love
[1:04:20] the Holy Ghost so when you get the Holy
[1:04:23] Ghost
[1:04:24] you don't have to make yourself love
[1:04:27] has been placed into your heart
[1:04:30] all the deity that was in Jesus Christ
[1:04:36] is in you
[1:04:38] and the love that he expressed on
[1:04:41] Calvary you can express in your
[1:04:45] situations
[1:04:48] now
[1:04:51] Hallelujah
[1:04:53] praise the Lord
[1:04:55] since I want to give you make you the
[1:04:57] illustration since you didn't know where
[1:04:58] it came from
[1:04:59] Hallelujah Now give me some of your love
[1:05:06] no no faking it right I know what I know
[1:05:09] no everyone knows when you're faking
[1:05:11] love give me some love
[1:05:14] you've got to be honest and say
[1:05:18] ain't got it
[1:05:21] I ain't got it
[1:05:24] but if I come and request it from you
[1:05:26] and say I need some love
[1:05:30] I'm gonna put that over your lap yeah
[1:05:34] that's enough
[1:05:36] then she has given me of something that
[1:05:40] she has because of the new birth
[1:05:46] now she's sitting there right next to
[1:05:48] her she ain't got it she's got it but
[1:05:50] because I've got it
[1:05:52] I can say I'll give you some love
[1:05:58] then I can give of myself and then she
[1:06:03] can give love
[1:06:06] now
[1:06:08] Hallelujah
[1:06:10] you want to drink it it's food coloring
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:15] okay so so love we'll come back to that
[1:06:19] in a minute all right love is is is God
[1:06:23] Love Is God himself
[1:06:27] the reason why the reason why complexes
[1:06:30] have come the scripture says the reason
[1:06:33] why fear is is uh comes is because of
[1:06:38] love he said because you're without love
[1:06:40] he said perfect love cast away
[1:06:45] all fear you'll do away with anxieties
[1:06:49] you'll do away with complexes you'll do
[1:06:52] away with fears if we can simply get
[1:06:58] well some of you simply get
[1:07:02] now I say tonight that if you've got the
[1:07:06] Holy Ghost
[1:07:07] then you've got love
[1:07:09] can people can people have love
[1:07:13] I have the Holy Ghost and still have
[1:07:15] complexes yeah yeah
[1:07:19] because they're not letting the Holy
[1:07:22] Ghost govern
[1:07:23] their emotions
[1:07:27] but if you allow the Holy Ghost to
[1:07:30] govern your emotions
[1:07:32] emotions will have no part in the in in
[1:07:36] the the management of your life
[1:07:40] it'll be centered around Divine love
[1:07:44] can you say Amen
[1:07:46] now amen
[1:07:48] they're
[1:07:49] they're the scripture you know they're
[1:07:53] they're in in
[1:07:55] first Thessalonians 4 and 9 it says but
[1:07:57] it's touching brotherly love you need
[1:07:59] not that I write unto you or to teach
[1:08:02] you
[1:08:03] for ye yourselves are taught of God
[1:08:08] to love
[1:08:10] one another
[1:08:12] wow now catch us now holy ghost given up
[1:08:15] it's not pulse Paul so Paul says I can't
[1:08:17] teach you this stuff I can't teach you
[1:08:19] this love this is given by the Holy
[1:08:22] Ghost let's look at another one Romans 2
[1:08:24] and 14.
[1:08:26] and when for when the Gentiles which
[1:08:29] have not the law do by nature of the
[1:08:31] things contained in the law these having
[1:08:34] not the law are alone to themselves
[1:08:36] which show the work of the law written
[1:08:39] in their hearts their conscience is also
[1:08:41] bearing witness let's go down to Romans
[1:08:43] 13 and 8. oh no man nothing but love one
[1:08:47] another he that loveth another hath
[1:08:50] fulfilled the law for this thou shall
[1:08:52] not commit adultery thou shall not kill
[1:08:54] thou shall not steal thus shall not bear
[1:08:55] false witness thou shall not covet if
[1:08:57] there be any other commandment it is
[1:08:59] briefly comprehended in this saying
[1:09:01] namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:09:04] thyself love works no ill to his
[1:09:07] neighbor therefore love is the
[1:09:10] Fulfillment
[1:09:12] of the law
[1:09:16] there's no more law because the law of
[1:09:19] love is taken over
[1:09:21] I I want us to catch this tonight and
[1:09:24] especially you mamas and daddies because
[1:09:26] as we're training our children and man
[1:09:30] we want to train them under the law of
[1:09:36] love
[1:09:38] mamas if you ain't loving your husbands
[1:09:40] and husbands if you ain't loving your
[1:09:42] mamas
[1:09:43] The Mamas and and you're not expressing
[1:09:46] that love the way that you should amen
[1:09:50] then we will We the the the child
[1:09:53] remember the child is a canvas
[1:09:58] blank
[1:10:01] amen as I've been preparing for this and
[1:10:03] and I I I I've been in there working on
[1:10:06] Josh's house on a little bit of tile and
[1:10:08] uh and I
[1:10:11] as I was as I was there uh Loretta would
[1:10:14] come over and and and just hearing that
[1:10:16] baby uh preaching and talking about God
[1:10:19] and singing and I'm thinking a little
[1:10:21] little to your and I know this is
[1:10:23] happening everywhere else this is just
[1:10:24] this is just something I've noticed here
[1:10:25] is is the canvas the canvas was empty
[1:10:29] the canvas the canvas was white
[1:10:34] and just in two years this child
[1:10:38] is portraying something
[1:10:43] when he gets to be five years old what
[1:10:46] is he going to be portraying when he
[1:10:47] gets 10 years old what's he going to be
[1:10:50] portraying
[1:10:53] come on
[1:10:54] because they're born with the sin nature
[1:10:58] yes
[1:11:00] that child is singing even with a sin
[1:11:02] nature in him
[1:11:04] but the influence the influence will
[1:11:07] take him to a new birth
[1:11:13] Hallelujah now
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:17] so they'll absorb anything that that you
[1:11:20] could communicate to them Hallelujah you
[1:11:23] communicate TVs you communicate a lot of
[1:11:25] movies before him you put a lot of
[1:11:27] things in there then they'll be that
[1:11:29] then then they'll be doing that they'll
[1:11:31] be doing all of your Disney stuff but
[1:11:33] because the child has had nothing but
[1:11:37] gospel put into him
[1:11:41] there is there is Gospel coming out of
[1:11:44] it
[1:11:47] you're training that child until you
[1:11:51] listen
[1:11:52] those Childs those children don't need
[1:11:55] the movies they don't need the games
[1:11:57] they don't need the latest of this they
[1:12:00] need Christ in this generation
[1:12:04] Christ was a servant come on
[1:12:07] so they absorb they'll absorb what they
[1:12:10] see what they hear they'll absorb how
[1:12:12] you respond to others they'll absorb
[1:12:15] your attitude towards your spouse
[1:12:17] they'll absorb what you say about others
[1:12:20] behind closed doors
[1:12:23] can you say Amen again how how do you
[1:12:26] act when others are blessed do you just
[1:12:28] stand back in sort of that little you
[1:12:31] they see that
[1:12:33] or do you still oh my goodness can't
[1:12:36] believe how
[1:12:37] that is so awesome I'm so glad you're
[1:12:40] blessed
[1:12:43] they see that what are you wanting to
[1:12:45] put on their canvas
[1:12:49] Hallelujah
[1:12:51] now
[1:12:53] you see
[1:12:55] and of course that scripture Romans 12
[1:12:58] and 15 Rejoice with them that do Rejoice
[1:13:00] weep with them that we first Corinthians
[1:13:03] 12 and 25 that there be no Schism in the
[1:13:06] body
[1:13:07] but that the members should have K the
[1:13:09] same care for one another whether one
[1:13:11] member suffer all the members suffer for
[1:13:13] it with it and one member honored all
[1:13:16] the members Rejoice with it now you are
[1:13:18] the body of Christ and members in
[1:13:21] particular can you say Amen
[1:13:23] so so your attitudes so amen am I doing
[1:13:27] all right here tonight
[1:13:28] your attitudes towards others matters
[1:13:33] Hallelujah
[1:13:36] you want to teach your children to
[1:13:37] respect other children
[1:13:40] you show the respect to the other
[1:13:43] children
[1:13:45] ah
[1:13:48] you show that respect
[1:13:50] amen because those children are their
[1:13:52] friends
[1:13:53] amen are you negative in your talk about
[1:13:57] their friends about other people's
[1:13:59] children are you negative in your
[1:14:01] communication with them
[1:14:04] or do you give positive responses
[1:14:07] well praise the Lord
[1:14:09] now if I'm wanting to build if I'm
[1:14:13] wanting to show how to build
[1:14:15] relationships then I must do it with my
[1:14:19] own attitudes and my own actions
[1:14:22] I show them how it is done
[1:14:26] if you leave this church and you are
[1:14:28] you're going home on Sunday amen and
[1:14:32] you're saying oh that so-and-so's kid
[1:14:36] Hallelujah
[1:14:37] you have just added another stroke to
[1:14:40] some to the canvas of that child
[1:14:43] well praise the Lord y'all y'all might
[1:14:46] as well say Amen
[1:14:48] that's right that's right you you are
[1:14:50] doing that now now they might not
[1:14:52] express it they might not express it
[1:14:54] immediately but the more you paint
[1:14:58] and the more you talk and the more
[1:15:00] attitudes you have you are creating you
[1:15:04] yourself not the child not the neighbor
[1:15:07] not the preacher not the church no one
[1:15:11] else you are creating what's on that
[1:15:15] canvas
[1:15:17] no one's no one no one no one is
[1:15:23] responsible for what happens to that
[1:15:25] child and how that canvas is painted
[1:15:27] except for you
[1:15:31] you're in authority
[1:15:34] well I'm preaching here tonight
[1:15:37] I must walk in Divine love
[1:15:44] well I thought this was going to be a
[1:15:46] little bit easier here tonight but
[1:15:47] that's all right I'll keep on preaching
[1:15:49] praise the Lord
[1:15:50] okay what do you mean what do you mean
[1:15:52] brother
[1:15:52] what do you mean brother Wendell
[1:15:55] amen okay let's take a child
[1:15:59] Hallelujah
[1:16:00] praise the Lord
[1:16:03] so
[1:16:04] this Mama's this child's mama
[1:16:08] and this child's mama
[1:16:10] are looking at these and of course this
[1:16:13] this this this this child's mama can't
[1:16:15] see
[1:16:17] hardly anything she does wrong and this
[1:16:19] child's mama can't see anything she does
[1:16:21] wrong
[1:16:22] now at home
[1:16:24] they see plenty but when it comes to
[1:16:27] someone else's child messing with their
[1:16:29] child hmm
[1:16:30] so
[1:16:31] so this Mama's child
[1:16:35] is is that comes and says
[1:16:38] my Nays
[1:16:40] she she done it to me again
[1:16:43] she said I'm fat
[1:16:46] and
[1:16:47] and and and she now now the response now
[1:16:51] that's now we don't know if that's
[1:16:53] really what happened or if it didn't
[1:16:55] happen
[1:16:56] now now this but this is her perception
[1:16:59] of it so this child is telling her mom
[1:17:02] and her Mama saying
[1:17:05] you know what
[1:17:07] I never did like that girl
[1:17:09] and I want you to stay away from that
[1:17:11] girl because that girl should not call
[1:17:13] you fat
[1:17:15] although your clothes are getting too
[1:17:17] big but I can say it she can't
[1:17:21] well that's that's that's
[1:17:24] that that doesn't make sense
[1:17:27] so how am I going to raise a child in a
[1:17:32] Loveless Society
[1:17:35] if I don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:17:38] governing my actions when I am
[1:17:41] counseling with her
[1:17:43] her mom should be saying well now are
[1:17:47] you sure you heard right
[1:17:48] are you now listen lanae's a good girl
[1:17:51] now she's growing too as we are all
[1:17:54] growing yeah uh but I you know I know
[1:17:58] lanae's a good girl now what we what we
[1:18:01] should probably do if this continues up
[1:18:02] we'll go talk to Mom and we'll just
[1:18:05] we'll just we'll we'll we'll talk it out
[1:18:07] and uh now no it's not your job to go
[1:18:10] correct the the other one no you just
[1:18:12] simply go to the mom and say hey we got
[1:18:13] a little conflict going on I don't know
[1:18:15] whether it's a complex I don't know
[1:18:17] what's going on but but here's the deal
[1:18:19] you know my girl is now think getting a
[1:18:22] complex thinking that she is fat because
[1:18:23] your girl keeps saying that she is fat
[1:18:25] and and so and then what are you doing
[1:18:28] you are teaching her how to handle it in
[1:18:34] love
[1:18:36] and you are still preserving
[1:18:40] her hope and her good will toward her
[1:18:44] friend in the fact that she's still
[1:18:46] growing and I'm sure if she really
[1:18:48] understands that she'll understand that
[1:18:51] maybe she didn't uh you know the the the
[1:18:54] the way the way she's saying things
[1:18:56] that's hurting your feelings what does
[1:18:58] it do you are teaching that child how to
[1:19:03] overcome
[1:19:07] well praise the Lord
[1:19:09] you know
[1:19:11] uh johnny makes you know Johnny's in
[1:19:13] gets a failure and uh you know uh
[1:19:17] Johnny's Johnny's doing something crazy

[1:19:24] what do you do you see you know when the
[1:19:25] child comes in and says Ah Johnny he
[1:19:28] just uh he just well and then and then

[1:19:34] prayer list tonight when we pray and
[1:19:36] we're going to start praying for for
[1:19:37] Johnny every night and because he's
[1:19:39] still growing in character as we all are
[1:19:42] growing in character
[1:19:46] can you say Amen you know what you're
[1:19:48] doing you are taking you are taking the
[1:19:52] fiery darts
[1:19:54] that could prick that heart
[1:19:57] and do damage to that heart
[1:20:00] and you're teaching them how to brush it
[1:20:02] off
[1:20:05] now if you sit there and and you and you

[1:24:01] and besides short guys are sort of dumb
[1:24:05] tall guys are sort of smart it's the
[1:24:08] reason why we're smart and you're dumb

[1:24:50] unless your children
[1:24:53] experiences being drawn out of the

[1:25:26] you right back in
[1:25:27] I said you can't draw me out
[1:25:30] because I love you
[1:25:33] see you just can't do it
[1:25:37] when you make one Circle God by his
[1:25:40] grace lets me draw another one and pull
[1:25:45] you right back again that's right draw
[1:25:49] them right back again
[1:25:54] then who becomes the big man

[1:26:25] that's for sure
[1:26:27] but you've taken a child that that have
[1:26:31] the potential of scarring and you have
[1:26:35] taken the word and you have taught him
[1:26:38] listen

[1:26:42] mean that they're they're just picking
[1:26:44] on you because you can't your feet don't
[1:26:45] touch the ground on the pews
[1:26:54] and then you can turn around
[1:26:57] and love
[1:26:59] and bring them right back in
[1:27:01] now if you let this boy sulk up
[1:27:06] and and go over over in a corner

[1:29:38] past you've still got those things in

[1:30:22] psychiatric Wards of the 1950s if the
[1:30:26] average this is statistic the average
[1:30:29] teenage kid
[1:30:31] has amen has the mental problems of what
[1:30:35] the 1950 psychiatric Wards had
[1:30:46] it's a curse
[1:30:49] and preaching on I would think I would
[1:30:51] think some of you parents would be happy
[1:30:52] that someone that the Lord lays this on
[1:30:54] your heart instead of just being a bull
[1:30:56] about it
[1:30:58] your spirit is so big and so loud
[1:31:01] tonight
[1:31:03] and it's so it's so out there it's your
[1:31:05] child
[1:31:12] to teach them how to succeed
[1:31:20] Holy Spirit puts this on my heart
[1:31:23] you're fighting the Holy Ghost
[1:31:27] I started this family thing for what
[1:31:29] four four weeks ago now five weeks ago
[1:31:31] started out with these with these things
[1:31:33] that are coming out
[1:31:35] amen it started on a Sunday morning when
[1:31:38] I was preacher when I was studying
[1:31:40] and before I came at her that one on
[1:31:43] that disciplined book
[1:31:45] stood out to me
[1:31:49] and he's and and I felt the Lord speak
[1:31:52] to my heart I'm not one that just goes
[1:31:54] around you know making everyone think
[1:31:55] that I'm a spiritual genius or giant
[1:31:58] that I hear from God all the time
[1:32:01] but I believe God get God anoints me to
[1:32:04] be a pastor he anoints me for every
[1:32:07] family in this congregation
[1:32:14] and he told me it's what good are the
[1:32:15] promises
[1:32:17] if the homes aren't disciplined
[1:32:20] and that's when I came out and said a
[1:32:21] rapture
[1:32:24] a Rapture in a lawless generation
[1:32:28] we've shirked the laws of God
[1:32:34] I want to tell you
[1:32:39] this generation that we're raising needs
[1:32:42] God
[1:32:44] and if for darn sure better start in
[1:32:46] that home with your attitude
[1:32:51] can you say my
[1:32:53] yes sir no I'm not I'm not a
[1:32:56] psychologist and I'm not trying to be a
[1:32:57] psychologist but I will say if you are
[1:33:01] parenting with complexes it's going to
[1:33:04] pass down to that next Generation what
[1:33:07] is wrong with a parent coming and crying
[1:33:10] out to God and say God get this evil
[1:33:13] spirit off of me
[1:33:15] heal my heart give me Grace give me
[1:33:19] overcoming power so that I can live it
[1:33:21] before others
[1:33:28] Hallelujah
[1:33:30] amen I'm not scared of devils
[1:33:33] I'm not scared of devils
[1:33:35] I'm here to set the captives free
[1:33:39] Devil's have no strongholds or they
[1:33:41] shouldn't have any stronghold in anyone
[1:33:43] any of God's children can you say Amen
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:48] you see it takes
[1:33:50] healthy parents
[1:33:52] to bring healthy children
[1:33:54] because your relationship must be
[1:33:56] aligned with God just uh correctly
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:01] and as you are aligned with God in the
[1:34:04] right way you love your spouse in the
[1:34:06] right way
[1:34:07] you love others in the right way
[1:34:10] but complexes come in and they block
[1:34:13] they cut off that love line
[1:34:17] then you can't love your wife like you
[1:34:19] should the wife can't love her husband
[1:34:21] like he should the children can't love
[1:34:23] their neighbors like they should can you
[1:34:26] say amen amen yes yes and I want to say
[1:34:29] this you know uh uh uh I'm not going to
[1:34:32] hold you too much longer but but you
[1:34:34] know uh uh uh you know
[1:34:38] your genetics genetics don't just pass
[1:34:41] down hair colors and personalities we we
[1:34:45] share the common physical traits
[1:34:50] but our attitudes and our and our way
[1:34:53] that our thinking many times are passed
[1:34:55] down to that next Generation too and I I
[1:34:58] want to say Amen that we also share
[1:35:00] relational and emotional patterns that
[1:35:03] our chair that our children inherit more
[1:35:05] than we think
[1:35:07] amen are you all understanding me so
[1:35:09] genetics let's look at genetics just for
[1:35:11] a minute it's the study of how different
[1:35:12] traits are passed down to the child it
[1:35:14] helps helps explain uh what makes you
[1:35:17] unique it helps you to understand why
[1:35:20] you have your hair color that helps you
[1:35:22] to understand certain diseases run in
[1:35:25] your family
[1:35:26] it helps you to understand these things
[1:35:28] and and it also helps us with with with
[1:35:32] with the emotional uh qualities or or
[1:35:36] the imperfections that might come with
[1:35:39] it too
[1:35:40] and if we know
[1:35:43] I'm boisterous I have to watch what did
[1:35:46] I teach my boys you're a Martin
[1:35:49] you're gonna be quick on the trigger
[1:35:51] it's passed down
[1:35:54] you guys gotta keep that under control
[1:35:57] I'm not going to justify myself and I'm
[1:35:58] not going to justify them
[1:36:04] he got it from his daddy
[1:36:12] but this Fallen trait must be governed
[1:36:18] by love
[1:36:21] praise the Lord
[1:36:23] amen hallelujah you love him
[1:36:27] no
[1:36:29] parental or the Parents emotional
[1:36:32] behaviors
[1:36:34] leave imprints on the child
[1:36:37] this the statistics say that even an
[1:36:40] unborn child
[1:36:41] a pregnant mother's feelings of fear
[1:36:44] anger and or hope whatever feeling she
[1:36:48] is is biochemically biochemically Alters
[1:36:52] The Unborn baby's genes they call it
[1:36:55] epigenetics now I'm not I'm not here to
[1:36:58] preach this stuff here but I'm just
[1:36:59] wanting to say what what the what what
[1:37:01] what what what the experts who think
[1:37:03] they know it all
[1:37:06] he says this change in the genes
[1:37:09] programs the baby and the way the baby
[1:37:12] interacts with the world
[1:37:14] this can affect many future Generations
[1:37:21] so even and I and I've even known that
[1:37:23] I've known that you take you take a a
[1:37:25] woman that is that is that is uh around
[1:37:29] a lot of anxiety she's anxious herself
[1:37:31] that baby will cry and cry and cry is
[1:37:33] because lots of times it was the
[1:37:35] environment that the baby was conceived
[1:37:37] in
[1:37:38] amen drug babies have have the problem a
[1:37:42] a hard time with grasping is because it
[1:37:45] was the way that the mama was conceived
[1:37:48] can you say amen and so so I what I am
[1:37:52] what I am saying here tonight is the
[1:37:55] early interactions with your child
[1:37:57] leaves that deep imprint upon them
[1:38:01] it affects the way that they process
[1:38:04] things in this world
[1:38:06] so your interaction with that baby
[1:38:08] someone says I'm doing a good job
[1:38:12] all right Hallelujah
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:18] it'll affect the way they process things
[1:38:20] in their minds
[1:38:22] it will affect the way they react to
[1:38:23] trauma
[1:38:25] the way you the way you're teaching them
[1:38:26] right now will teach them how to react
[1:38:28] to trauma
[1:38:30] stress
[1:38:32] it will also affect and this is this is
[1:38:35] what this is what they're saying it
[1:38:37] affects the way they view others and
[1:38:39] relationships
[1:38:41] amen
[1:38:43] this imprint affects how they deal with
[1:38:46] future relationships
[1:38:48] now this is this is pretty incredible
[1:38:50] stuff
[1:38:51] what they are learning at an early age
[1:38:55] in the home
[1:38:58] will set them on course
[1:39:01] for Ministry
[1:39:03] or could set them on course
[1:39:07] with the rest of the Millennials of
[1:39:09] wowzy wowzy woo
[1:39:12] woe is me
[1:39:15] and then you'll have an entire
[1:39:17] generation demanding
[1:39:19] from others
[1:39:22] thinking that they're old
[1:39:28] Ministry
[1:39:30] in this day
[1:39:32] can still be had
[1:39:34] and I'm glad that I've got I'm talking

[1:43:30] difficulty in a relationship how are you
[1:43:33] teaching them to short up amen you just
[1:43:36] let them say hey honey there's there's
[1:43:38] two sides to every story are you sure
[1:43:40] that you heard
[1:43:43] right now now how did you handle it now
[1:43:45] I'm hearing what you said but what what
[1:43:46] did you say back what what's what's
[1:43:50] you know honey someone told me the other
[1:43:52] day that you were picking on little
[1:43:54] children
[1:43:55] no no no you know the goose came call
[1:43:59] the gander
[1:44:00] the coppod can't call the kettled black
[1:44:05] you know now listen you children now you
[1:44:09] guys you guys have got to line it up now
[1:44:11] with the disciplined book well praise
[1:44:14] the Lord
[1:44:15] amen or if it was like my mother this
[1:44:17] was her one of her wonderful lines it
[1:44:19] sounds to me like the Lord has given us
[1:44:21] an opportunity to pray about this
[1:44:23] situation
[1:44:25] given us an opportunity
[1:44:29] the Lord's working something in your
[1:44:30] life Wendell that's the last thing I
[1:44:32] wanted to hear that's the last thing I
[1:44:34] want to hear today
[1:44:36] the Lord's worked in something in your
[1:44:37] life
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:45] well we don't do
[1:44:47] don't do it huh
[1:44:48] but we're teaching amen
[1:44:51] I think as I as I was studied along this
[1:44:54] lines I wanted I want to share this one
[1:44:55] one other this one other tidbit you
[1:44:58] should never share your grievances
[1:45:02] with your children
[1:45:06] should never hear
[1:45:09] adult conversations
[1:45:15] I've got to say that I lived in a in a
[1:45:17] ministering house
[1:45:20] my dad was the associate pastor there
[1:45:23] with brother Burris
[1:45:26] and
[1:45:28] there was a lot counseling lots of
[1:45:30] things going on my dad my dad done most
[1:45:32] of the counseling
[1:45:37] I I didn't know I didn't know anything
[1:45:40] about anything
[1:45:42] I was friends with some of the biggest
[1:45:44] troublemakers children in the church
[1:45:46] Hallelujah
[1:45:49] I I was I I didn't know I didn't know
[1:45:52] what all they'd done
[1:45:55] Mom and Dad talked but anytime mom or
[1:45:58] dad would want to say something to Mom
[1:45:59] now you know I wasn't saying that us
[1:46:01] kids didn't try to put our ear by the
[1:46:02] door
[1:46:03] trying to hear what was going on but
[1:46:05] they didn't speak
[1:46:07] about situations in the church or in the
[1:46:10] family or this that and the other
[1:46:12] with us children present
[1:46:14] you know why
[1:46:18] children
[1:46:19] are to be protected
[1:46:25] their Spirits should remain free
[1:46:28] they don't need to know about family
[1:46:30] problems they don't need to know about
[1:46:32] church problems they don't need to know
[1:46:34] what sister so-and-so done to you or
[1:46:37] brother so and so quit the church or
[1:46:39] anything else Mom and Dad should always
[1:46:42] talk about these situations behind
[1:46:46] closed doors and those children should
[1:46:49] know nothing about it
[1:46:53] amen that's right
[1:46:56] that that's that that's uh you got
[1:46:59] you're we're back stomping the toes
[1:47:01] again can I hear an amen
[1:47:04] we protect our children you don't you've
[1:47:06] oh oh we want to protect
[1:47:09] and if we're not careful while we're
[1:47:11] protecting our little Johnny because uh
[1:47:14] so-and-so hit him in the head with a
[1:47:15] rock
[1:47:17] are you protecting
[1:47:20] the soul
[1:47:22] are you keeping the complexes off the
[1:47:24] spirit man so that he can Thrive and
[1:47:26] overcome that wound sometimes us parents
[1:47:30] are wounding our children more than the
[1:47:32] rock is wound in the head
[1:47:35] the wound heals here
[1:47:38] but the heart is here because the way
[1:47:40] the parents have not handled it by love
[1:47:47] well glory to God
[1:47:50] amen that's right
[1:47:53] if there is a matter
[1:47:57] you just remember those children are
[1:47:59] still developing mentally
[1:48:03] emotionally they're still developing you
[1:48:08] can choose what you put on that canvas
[1:48:11] but I tell you tonight I would put
[1:48:15] nothing but love
[1:48:17] on that canvas of their heart
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:27] thing
[1:48:28] no one else has the ability to do it you
[1:48:31] have that I don't have that ability
[1:48:33] I'm a preacher
[1:48:35] and I love these kids
[1:48:37] the mama on the day of judgment
[1:48:40] it's going to be you and the way you
[1:48:42] handle that child and and God's going to
[1:48:44] look at that picture and say what were
[1:48:46] you trying to paint
[1:48:48] I don't see myself in that
[1:48:52] because what I found out
[1:48:55] and I gave you a little bit of a little
[1:48:57] bit of last week
[1:48:59] I know about pain I know what it is to
[1:49:01] be made fun of
[1:49:03] my sister knows what it is we listen
[1:49:07] you you don't you don't know
[1:49:09] until you've been through some real real
[1:49:12] real real real stuff
[1:49:15] I've been there I've been there
[1:49:19] and yet I came out of that
[1:49:21] there's plenty of times dad had to stand
[1:49:23] because I I fought bitterness I did
[1:49:26] but I'm so glad Dad refused to take
[1:49:29] sides with me
[1:49:30] and in fact he would tell me one time I
[1:49:33] remember him getting in my face I love
[1:49:36] you
[1:49:37] stand up brother Luke
[1:49:39] I was a teenager like you
[1:49:43] and I'm over there about like and he
[1:49:45] gets in my face he said you are no
[1:49:48] better than the people that are doing it
[1:49:51] to you
[1:49:51] because you've become an angry boy
[1:49:55] wait a minute don't turn this on me I'm
[1:49:58] turning it on you you're allowing them
[1:50:01] to make an ugly boy of you
[1:50:10] I wasn't proud of my daddy
[1:50:14] but he taught me
[1:50:16] if you keep it up you're going to scar
[1:50:22] you're going to scar
[1:50:23] keep the blood flowing
[1:50:27] and let God heal it
[1:50:29] can you say Amen thank you buddy
[1:50:31] amen
[1:50:32] when I was when I was growing up or when
[1:50:35] I was pastoring I had a church split
[1:50:39] and so I was angry and mad and ready to
[1:50:42] quit oh I was dad says you'll be coming
[1:50:46] the man
[1:50:48] that you hate
[1:50:54] becoming the man
[1:50:57] you're just just you're you're no better
[1:50:59] than this one in your bitter self you
[1:51:02] cannot help anybody else
[1:51:06] I was learning at a very early age
[1:51:09] that it's not about me
[1:51:12] it's about him
[1:51:14] Living Through Me
[1:51:16] and I've also found out
[1:51:19] that while I have been hurt many times
[1:51:22] and maybe by some of you folks here
[1:51:27] I've also found out
[1:51:29] that I can hurt others
[1:51:33] that I need forgiveness
[1:51:36] that I can be a jerk
[1:51:38] that I can say things wrong that I can
[1:51:41] get it wrong
[1:51:44] and when I'm condemned
[1:51:46] and feeling bad
[1:51:48] I need somebody
[1:51:52] that has the love of God
[1:51:56] that can pour it in
[1:51:58] and pour it in forgiveness
[1:52:01] and pour in love
[1:52:03] I need someone who can reflect that to
[1:52:06] me
[1:52:07] are y'all understanding
[1:52:08] are you kids understanding
[1:52:10] Hallelujah
[1:52:12] I mean this big kid understanding
[1:52:14] Hallelujah she's the pretty kid right
[1:52:16] there praise the Lord
[1:52:18] amen so so he that's that's that's where
[1:52:22] that's where we are amen so we are
[1:52:25] absolutely somebody say I am absolutely
[1:52:28] Duty bound
[1:52:31] to protect their hearts
[1:52:36] from hard feelings toward others
[1:52:38] from bitterness from losing trust and
[1:52:41] Authority
[1:52:42] I refuse I will bring healing I will
[1:52:48] show according to scripture how to love
[1:52:50] the enemy how to how to to love my
[1:52:54] friend I will stand there and teach them
[1:52:57] to love and I can say come follow me can
[1:53:01] you save man
[1:53:03] amen
[1:53:04] praise the Lord
[1:53:07] as the musicians come
[1:53:09] they
[1:53:10] I think I think the very worst thing we
[1:53:13] could do
[1:53:17] is to
[1:53:19] use our children as counselors
[1:53:25] they call this parentification that's
[1:53:29] that's that's the term that they call it
[1:53:33] this is
[1:53:34] this occurs when the parents look to
[1:53:37] their children
[1:53:38] for emotional support
[1:53:41] rather than providing the emotional
[1:53:44] support
[1:53:45] so the child becomes the counselor
[1:53:48] The Confident the problem solver so what
[1:53:52] it is is it's Mom
[1:53:54] that's got her that's got her complexes
[1:53:57] and and and she's and and and she takes
[1:54:01] her son
[1:54:03] and and she begins to share her
[1:54:05] complexes with this son
[1:54:08] well this boy he's a smart and Brilliant
[1:54:10] boy but you're a girl or whoever and
[1:54:13] you're and and you're and and so now
[1:54:15] you're you're you're you're sharing your
[1:54:17] wolves and this that and the other with
[1:54:19] them and it's called parentification and
[1:54:22] what you are doing you you are making
[1:54:24] that child
[1:54:26] your counselor now you don't want to be
[1:54:29] told
[1:54:30] that you're wrong so you choose the
[1:54:33] child
[1:54:34] you don't want an authority figure that
[1:54:37] you want him to listen but he has no
[1:54:39] power
[1:54:40] and so what you're doing is you is
[1:54:42] you're talking about this one or you're
[1:54:44] talking about that one you're talking
[1:54:45] about your problem and and and and and
[1:54:49] be it and he becomes the one that
[1:54:53] everyone begins to to count on
[1:54:56] and and so but he but but the thing is
[1:54:59] you're warping that Spirit of that boy
[1:55:02] or girl
[1:55:03] because he's still a child
[1:55:06] amen and the sad thing they grow up with
[1:55:09] guilt bitter
[1:55:12] feeling unworthy because he couldn't
[1:55:14] help untrusting of people neurotic and
[1:55:17] nervous
[1:55:19] now they say this is a major thing
[1:55:22] that that this kind of thing goes on and
[1:55:24] we we have experienced it here I've
[1:55:27] we've experienced it firsthand
[1:55:31] where where an individual
[1:55:34] just
[1:55:36] complex after complex and instead of the
[1:55:38] woman
[1:55:39] getting a hold of the altar dying out to
[1:55:43] God and asking God for healing of her
[1:55:45] heart
[1:55:46] she would sit there and consult with her
[1:55:49] Sons
[1:55:52] until those those poor children didn't
[1:55:54] know what was right or wrong she she was
[1:55:57] she she wasn't thinking properly
[1:55:59] everyone loved her but the way that she
[1:56:02] was trying to tell and this undeveloped
[1:56:04] mind was sitting there and just taking
[1:56:06] it in
[1:56:07] I can't believe really
[1:56:11] what did it do
[1:56:12] well then he couldn't trust anybody in
[1:56:14] the church
[1:56:17] he couldn't trust anybody in the church
[1:56:20] now he says there's no such thing as God
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:28] and all the while Mama's saying oh
[1:56:30] please pray for my son
[1:56:32] Paul please pray for my sons
[1:56:34] he said quit talking to your sons
[1:56:39] you're the parent
[1:56:42] they're the son
[1:56:44] quit sharing all of your nonsense
[1:56:48] with your son
[1:56:49] he's not meant to carry your load
[1:56:54] I'll praise the Lord
[1:56:59] well
[1:57:01] I can say that I've I've
[1:57:05] put my I've put my heart into it here
[1:57:07] tonight
[1:57:09] and my my thoughts and my prayer into it
[1:57:11] tonight
[1:57:13] I don't want fear to be passed down to
[1:57:15] the Next Generation I don't want
[1:57:16] complexes to be passed down to the Next
[1:57:18] Generation
[1:57:20] I'm here to tell you folks there are
[1:57:22] some complexes that we all carry that
[1:57:25] are generational complexes we already

[1:57:31] that come but I'm here to tell you
[1:57:33] I believe
[1:57:34] that if we stand in in with the blood of
[1:57:38] Jesus Christ and with the word of God
[1:57:39] and get the Holy Ghost we can overcome
[1:57:42] all things
[1:57:44] can you say man

[1:57:49] one author said when we heal ourselves
[1:57:54] we heal the generation that follows

[1:58:00] until someone is ready to feel it
[1:58:03] heal it and Let It Go
