[53:22] was going to be struggling up here
[53:23] preaching amen with his crazy voice but
[53:26] God is faithful God is faithful God
[53:28] seemed the whole thing and yet God said
[53:31] before the foundation of the world they
[53:34] are mine and Satan there is nothing you
[53:37] can do that is going to change my mind I
[53:42] am faithful
[53:44] oh that that should that should make you
[53:47] a Baptist shout amen faithful God has
[53:51] been faithful to me amen Deuteronomy now
[53:56] it says know therefore that the Lord
[53:59] your God is God the faithful God who
[54:04] keeps Covenant and steadfast love for
[54:08] those who love him and keep his
[54:12] Commandments to a thousand Generations
[54:13] amen there in Psalms 36 and 5 for your
[54:17] steadfast love the Lord that extends to
[54:20] the heavens your faithfulness
[54:23] to the clouds amen God is faithful now
[54:30] amen I you know just as I'm as I begin
[54:32] to look through some of these scriptures
[54:34] here amen and I I I I I I just wanted to
[54:38] to to to just just go over some of these
[54:41] scriptures because there's they're
[54:43] really good but but Psalms 89 and 8 it
[54:46] says oh Lord God of hosts who is as
[54:51] mighty as you are oh lord your
[54:55] faithfulness uh with your faithfulness
[54:58] all around you I I began to think about
[55:02] that faithfulness now if he's faithful
[55:05] again if he's faithful to those that a
[55:08] man uh uh you know to his creation and
[55:11] he's and he's faithful to uh you know
[55:14] those that that that forsaken the Bible
[55:17] says that he that he that he shines his
[55:19] son upon the just and the unjust and he
[55:22] sends his Reign upon the good and upon
[55:24] the evil and if he keeps his Word of
[55:27] Promise to them how much more will God
[55:30] do amen for the believer that's got his
[55:33] names wrote in his their names written
[55:35] in his book Jesus said there in John 10
[55:38] and 27 he says my sheep hear my voice
[55:41] and I know them and they follow me I
[55:46] give unto them
[55:47] eternal life and they shall never perish
[55:51] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[55:56] my hand
[55:57] My Father which gave them me is greater
[56:02] than all and no man is able to block
[56:07] them out of my hand
[56:10] [Music]
[56:11] because he's faithful
[56:14] Hallelujah you turn to your neighbor and
[56:16] tell him he is faithful
[56:18] when we say he's faithful that means
[56:21] your call is secure
[56:23] that means your purpose is secure
[56:26] that means that everything that God has
[56:29] amen there according to second second
[56:33] Timothy the second chapter and I think
[56:35] about the 19th verse amen he says
[56:38] nevertheless
[56:39] he says the the the the foundation of
[56:43] God stands sure
[56:46] God knows
[56:49] them that are his
[56:52] Hallelujah he knows them that are his
[56:56] this morning can you say amen amen so I
[57:00] I I think about that now
[57:03] I was thinking of another thing when I
[57:06] think about the faithfulness of God
[57:08] is faithful to give us the baptism of
[57:12] the Holy Ghost
[57:14] as I was as I've been thinking you know
[57:17] around about the Holy Ghost these last
[57:20] few weeks and amen and and Joe just been
[57:25] something that has been upon my heart
[57:27] you know Jesus last words you know a
[57:30] dying man a man that's only got 24 hours
[57:34] he and he knows he's going to die
[57:38] usually what's at the Forefront of his
[57:41] mind or deeply upon his heart is what
[57:45] he's going to talk about if you've only
[57:47] got 24 hours left
[57:50] and you've got your family you're you're
[57:52] not going to be talking about but you're
[57:55] going to be talking about things that
[57:57] are very precious serious to you that
[58:02] you hold dear to your heart can you say
[58:05] man and Jesus amen his last day with his
[58:10] disciples was very revealing because he
[58:13] knows his time is getting close now if
[58:16] you look there in Saint John the the uh
[58:19] 13th 14th 15th 16th 17th chapter you you
[58:24] begin to see as as as as as Jesus is
[58:28] nearing and especially amen the the uh
[58:32] uh 14th 15th and 16th chapter
[58:36] Jesus begins to really narrow in to on
[58:40] his disciples and he and he's telling
[58:43] them now I'm Divine you're the branches
[58:46] in other words I'm I'm the root here and
[58:50] you're not going to see me anymore
[58:52] I'm fixing to leave but I'm going to be
[58:57] faithful to live my life through you
[59:02] now up to this point you've depended on
[59:06] me to be your comforter you've depended
[59:08] on me Amen to hear your you've
[59:11] depended upon me to do those to go help
[59:14] your family you've depicted amen Peter
[59:17] brought his brought his uh is his
[59:19] mother-in-law over a man to be healed he
[59:22] amen another time Peter got in trouble
[59:24] with his taxes amen came to Jesus and
[59:27] Jesus says hey go go in there and cast
[59:30] into the water and amen the first fish
[59:31] he got open up the uh open up the mouth
[59:34] and and pay your taxes and my taxes he
[59:38] was a comforter unto those disciples but
[59:41] Jesus is saying I've got to leave
[59:45] and if I don't leave you're going to be
[59:48] looking to me all the time you're going
[59:51] to be looking to me for every situation
[59:53] but I've got to leave
[59:56] so that I can send a comforter back he
[1:00:00] says now up to this point you've asked
[1:00:03] me you've come and asked me but he says
[1:00:05] at that day you're not asking me
[1:00:08] anything but you'll come to the father
[1:00:12] in my name and whatsoever things you
[1:00:16] desire oh Hallelujah now Jesus is
[1:00:20] letting them know now I am leaving I've
[1:00:23] got to go if I don't go the the place
[1:00:27] won't be prepared and I'll never be able
[1:00:29] to receive it to myself but I promise
[1:00:32] you I'm going to remain faithful you're
[1:00:35] not going to see me you're not going to
[1:00:38] hug me you're not going to to to hear me
[1:00:42] preach to you physically anymore I'm
[1:00:46] but my faithfulness
[1:00:48] will remain true
[1:00:50] my power might Hallelujah that's the
[1:00:54] reason why I think that it's so
[1:00:56] important for you young people oh I want
[1:00:59] you young people to receive the baptism
[1:01:00] of the Holy Ghost now now it's easy it's
[1:01:04] easy for somebody amen you know when you
[1:01:07] you when you're when you're there uh

[1:01:15] muck in the mind and and uh you know
[1:01:18] you're a drug addict or you're a man and
[1:01:21] and when the presence of God comes upon
[1:01:23] you it's easy for you to reach out and
[1:01:26] say I need help I need something amen
[1:01:29] and you grab it because it's your last
[1:01:32] hope you have
[1:01:33] and we'll praise the Lord how many of
[1:01:35] you all amen that came out of those real
[1:01:38] dark areas that God had to deliver you
[1:01:40] from from alcohol and drugs and and
[1:01:43] addictions and bring you out of those
[1:01:45] things you had to have a supernatural
[1:01:50] Touch Of God you had to rely upon the
[1:01:54] supernatural in your life
[1:01:56] then you say Amen but where
[1:01:59] where where
[1:02:00] we where things get a little bit shaky

[1:02:07] generation

[1:02:48] Amen to me the greatest thing is for God
[1:02:53] to come in and feel somebody sitting on
[1:02:57] the pews full of the Holy Ghost because
[1:03:00] they've got to come to an understanding
[1:03:03] that they need that comforter themselves
[1:03:08] they've got your Hallelujah when you're
[1:03:11] not addicted to something amen well you
[1:03:14] you don't appreciate it as as maybe
[1:03:16] brother Joe or sister Stephanie that
[1:03:18] that came out of those that the heroin
[1:03:21] addicts can you say Amen but we all need
[1:03:24] the Holy Ghost and God is faithful to
[1:03:29] give us the Holy Spirit today
[1:03:33] oh hallelujah amen to me one of the
[1:03:36] greatest things is God to keep a man a
[1:03:39] boy a girl from ever going outside and
[1:03:41] never going out there and falling in sin
[1:03:44] never going out there and being indicted
[1:03:46] by drugs and alcohol amen and that can
[1:03:49] come in and and God revealed by the
[1:03:52] power of His spirit amen his great light
[1:03:55] shine over them and and and for them to
[1:03:59] see the wretchedness of their soul the
[1:04:03] wretchedness of their heart and how that
[1:04:06] they need a comfort they need the power
[1:04:09] of the Holy Spirit and that boy or girl
[1:04:12] young man young young woman amen even a
[1:04:15] man or a woman can come to God
[1:04:18] and say God I am wretched without you I
[1:04:24] need you in my life just like the drug
[1:04:27] addict does just like the alcoholic does
[1:04:30] I need you
[1:04:34] can you say that
[1:04:36] amen now do you love him
[1:04:38] yes so when we look at uh at these
[1:04:43] things Jesus
[1:04:45] was letting them know Hallelujah he was
[1:04:49] letting them know
[1:04:51] I'm leaving
[1:04:54] go go home and read the 13th chapter the
[1:04:58] 14th chapter the 15th chapter the 16th
[1:05:00] chapter the 17th chapter of John
[1:05:04] Jesus is telling them in every scenario
[1:05:06] I'm going
[1:05:07] but I'm coming back but I'm going to
[1:05:09] send the comforter back to you can you
[1:05:12] say man amen
[1:05:14] because God was going to be faithful
[1:05:18] somebody say God is faithful all the
[1:05:21] sincerity I think the sincerity should
[1:05:24] be very very great in our lives and God
[1:05:28] you who who brought me maybe he did
[1:05:30] bring you out of drugs and alcohol but
[1:05:32] he's faithful to take you on and
[1:05:34] complete you amen those of you that are
[1:05:37] setting on the message pews and maybe
[1:05:38] you've never smoked a cigarette or
[1:05:40] you've never man you uh maybe you've
[1:05:43] you've never got drunk or any of those
[1:05:46] things and God bless you amen we we
[1:05:49] don't want you to ever have to go out
[1:05:51] there and do those things but we must
[1:05:53] know that God has a purpose Jesus had to
[1:05:57] die for you good boys and girls just
[1:06:00] like he had to die amen for those
[1:06:03] raunchy Sinners we're all Sinners we're
[1:06:07] out raunchy we're all going to hell
[1:06:12] except for the grace of God and his
[1:06:15] faithfulness
[1:06:16] to his word oh
[1:06:20] oh that'll make you want to shout amen
[1:06:23] when you're having problems with your
[1:06:25] amen with with things in your heart
[1:06:27] maybe you know
[1:06:29] Hallelujah if we had folks with the Holy
[1:06:32] Ghost a little bit more in the church we
[1:06:34] we we we probably amen wouldn't have all
[1:06:37] the the debates and the arguings and the
[1:06:40] fightings and things because when the
[1:06:42] Holy Spirit has come he is our comforter
[1:06:44] we don't find comfort in hate we don't
[1:06:47] find Comfort Amen in dysfunction We Are
[1:06:51] The Same Spirit that moved upon the face
[1:06:54] of the deep in the beginning when God
[1:06:56] said let there be louder when he says in
[1:06:59] the beginning God created the heavens
[1:07:02] and the earth and the spirit of the Lord
[1:07:04] moved upon the face of the deep amen he
[1:07:08] took chaos he took he meant when the
[1:07:11] Earth was without form and without void
[1:07:13] when it when it had nothing beautiful
[1:07:15] about it the Bible says that the spirit
[1:07:18] of God what is the spirit of God it's
[1:07:20] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost amen moved
[1:07:24] upon the the face of the deep what did
[1:07:27] he do amen it was that that word that
[1:07:30] word moved upon it means to brood over
[1:07:33] like a hen does her chicks like a hen
[1:07:36] does her ex amen it it means to calm
[1:07:40] upon and the spirit that moved upon the
[1:07:44] Earth had to be killing it's the same
[1:07:47] Spirit that'll move on our chaos
[1:07:51] and will bring order to our lives it'll
[1:07:54] bring order to our minds it'll bring Oya
[1:07:57] to our heart it'll bring order to a
[1:08:00] church it'll bring order to a family
[1:08:02] it'll bring order why because it's the
[1:08:05] holy spirit that is brooding
[1:08:09] Hallelujah
[1:08:11] amen
[1:08:13] now the chicken has got to set on those
[1:08:16] eggs
[1:08:17] until life comes
[1:08:20] Hallelujah
[1:08:23] now A chicken can set on those eggs and
[1:08:25] if there's no life in the egg
[1:08:29] there's nothing there

[1:08:33] amen now chicken can sit on that egg
[1:08:36] that egg can set on there until she dies
[1:08:38] but if there's no life inside the eggs
[1:08:41] there ain't gonna be nothing hatch
[1:08:44] but if there is life inside you he's
[1:08:49] going to be faithful

[1:08:58] faithful you're the egg he's the mama
[1:09:02] and my chick he he's the mama Eagle we
[1:09:05] don't like being called chicks amen uh
[1:09:07] he's well you're a little eaglet you're

[1:09:13] over you
[1:09:15] because there's life
[1:09:18] oh
[1:09:21] I say today
[1:09:23] that we need a greater desire for the
[1:09:27] Holy Spirit

[1:09:32] don't want to be an egg
[1:09:34] a man in the in in the Nast I want the
[1:09:40] Holy Spirit to brood over me and bring
[1:09:45] my egg to life

[1:09:56] attitude together it ain't a daddy

[1:10:18] until amen and the egg is shaking around
[1:10:20] what's going on is there is a life on
[1:10:22] the inside of the egg and it's pecking
[1:10:24] and pecking and pecking and pecking and
[1:10:26] pecking amen why because the chicken is
[1:10:29] alive on the inside of the egg and it's
[1:10:31] Gotta come out of the shell and when we
[1:10:33] get the power of the Holy Spirit and God

[1:10:46] more of God I want to obey him I want to
[1:10:50] live his life I want the power oh come
[1:10:52] on church and then what is it it's God's
[1:10:55] divine power within you living and
[1:10:59] wanting to come out of that old egg that
[1:11:02] has you bound
[1:11:05] Hallelujah
[1:11:07] amen sincerity
[1:11:09] is right
[1:11:10] so you don't have to be addicted
[1:11:12] you don't have to have those things what
[1:11:14] you do have to have
[1:11:16] is an understanding
[1:11:18] that without the power of God
[1:11:20] amen you will lay there in that egg or
[1:11:24] in that nest and rot is that right so
[1:11:27] God
[1:11:29] is faithful
[1:11:31] many times
[1:11:33] people have looked at Samson hmm Samson
[1:11:35] he was just not all you kids y'all love
[1:11:38] Samson I love Samson when I was a kid
[1:11:40] and he meant strong man he could he
[1:11:43] could take Gates and and he could he
[1:11:46] could um uh rip lions in two and and he
[1:11:50] could he he he he caught he went 300 uh
[1:11:55] foxes
[1:11:56] and you know somehow or another tied
[1:12:00] their tails together and how he'd done
[1:12:03] that without the foxes biting them and
[1:12:05] 300 foxes ties all their tails together
[1:12:08] sets them on fire amen and sends them
[1:12:10] down to the Philistines and sets the
[1:12:12] whole place on fire
[1:12:14] amen I mean Samson was just he was just
[1:12:17] oh some my he was just some big hero and
[1:12:20] and you know you you look you look at
[1:12:23] the at the at the books
[1:12:25] the kids books and and they always have
[1:12:28] him as just just big old huge guy but
[1:12:31] Samson did not have strength on his own
[1:12:33] ability
[1:12:34] no
[1:12:36] his strength and his power was in his
[1:12:38] Covenant
[1:12:40] and the Holy Spirit is a covenant that
[1:12:43] God made with you
[1:12:48] is that right
[1:12:49] it wasn't it wasn't that he Mr Samson
[1:12:51] was he was God on Earth he was Reliant
[1:12:55] and every time he'd done something major
[1:12:58] big any time he picked up the gates
[1:13:01] anytime that he the Bible says and the
[1:13:04] spirit of the Lord moved upon Samson
[1:13:10] God was faithful to Samson because
[1:13:15] Samson was in Covenant with his God
[1:13:19] foreign
[1:13:21] what did the scripture says if the
[1:13:22] scripture says and this is the Covenant
[1:13:25] that I will make with him in that day
[1:13:27] saith God I there are sins and their
[1:13:30] iniquities will I remember no more and I
[1:13:34] will write my laws on the inward parts
[1:13:37] of their heart and upon their minds will
[1:13:40] I inscribe them amen there in the book
[1:13:43] of Hebrews the scripture says and the
[1:13:45] Holy Ghost is the witness of this
[1:13:49] Covenant
[1:13:51] ah Hallelujah why would you not want it
[1:13:55] why would you not want the power come in
[1:13:58] contact and Covenant with God where he
[1:14:02] says I'll be faithful to my word to you
[1:14:05] in my name you'll cast out devils in my
[1:14:08] name you'll speak in new tongues in my
[1:14:10] name you will do those things you see
[1:14:13] when you come with that Covenant with
[1:14:15] God
[1:14:19] now
[1:14:22] but when we start playing around with
[1:14:24] that Covenant and we get away from it
[1:14:28] amen
[1:14:29] after they cut the hair some says well
[1:14:32] the Secret's in the hair no no the hair
[1:14:36] has nothing to do with it it was the
[1:14:38] Covenant
[1:14:42] and when you get away from your
[1:14:44] relationship with God and the Covenant
[1:14:46] that God has called you to you'll lose
[1:14:48] your power too
[1:14:51] well come on now you'll lose your power
[1:14:54] just like Samson did
[1:14:56] amen
[1:14:58] and then what happened which he says
[1:15:00] Samson the Philistines are upon you he
[1:15:03] jumps up and the Bible says he shakes
[1:15:06] himself as he had done in times past
[1:15:10] this time
[1:15:12] he had no power
[1:15:14] is that right so the power is in the
[1:15:18] Holy Spirit not the man
[1:15:21] and when we received the baptism of the
[1:15:24] Holy Ghost we receive his power in our
[1:15:28] lives
[1:15:31] I had a I had
[1:15:34] Assemblies of God and he's he's went on
[1:15:37] now
[1:15:38] amen and brother Eubanks when I I was
[1:15:42] when I first came to town
[1:15:43] amen he he had sort of he locked me you
[1:15:47] know and took me under his wings and and
[1:15:50] uh hey we were just little we were just
[1:15:52] kids you know and he he he he he was
[1:15:55] trying to make a uh an Assemblies of God
[1:15:58] guy out of us and and uh and so one day
[1:16:03] he says you know he says little brother
[1:16:06] he says now I know that Holiness stuff
[1:16:08] and that you preach is it's in the Bible
[1:16:11] right I'm only I'm it's in there
[1:16:14] but he says
[1:16:15] but little buddy
[1:16:17] no one can live that stuff
[1:16:21] no one can live it
[1:16:22] and so you got to be careful
[1:16:25] at your demands
[1:16:27] and I looked back at him and I said you
[1:16:30] know what
[1:16:31] a Believer can
[1:16:33] a Believer can live it
[1:16:36] not in themselves not in themselves just
[1:16:40] as Samson is just as much of a wimp
[1:16:45] without the holy spirit so are you a
[1:16:48] wimp without the Holy Spirit but when
[1:16:51] the Holy Spirit comes up on you
[1:16:55] then you're becoming powered to live a
[1:16:59] supernatural life
[1:17:04] you'll become empowered
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:13] Covenant with you
[1:17:15] the holy spirit is a covenant between
[1:17:18] the invisible world
[1:17:20] and the visible world the holy spirit is
[1:17:24] the sign it's the Covenant it's that
[1:17:26] it's the very thing that Hallelujah the
[1:17:29] holy spirit says I have received the
[1:17:34] blood of your sacrifice
[1:17:37] and I am coming down and saying that you
[1:17:41] have been accepted by God
[1:17:44] no come on now when you receive the Holy
[1:17:48] Ghost you can look there to the devil
[1:17:50] and tell the devil Hallelujah I'm in
[1:17:52] Covenant with God God has accepted my
[1:17:55] sacrifice I have a right to believe I
[1:17:57] have a right to speak I have a right
[1:17:59] Amen to to to know and expect that
[1:18:02] everything that God's promised is true
[1:18:04] and it will come to pass
[1:18:08] Hallelujah
[1:18:10] because he's a faithful God
[1:18:12] amen all the sincerity the sincerity of
[1:18:16] the believer the believer that will
[1:18:18] stand up and it'll stand he in in the
[1:18:20] midst of it all I've got a covenant
[1:18:22] Hallelujah
[1:18:24] and when Samson felt back
[1:18:26] and started feeling his hair
[1:18:29] coming back
[1:18:31] he felt that hair
[1:18:33] and what did he say
[1:18:35] Lord perhaps maybe
[1:18:39] you would do this just one more time
[1:18:42] when you called me at the beginning
[1:18:46] and you told me and I I I I I've got my
[1:18:49] eyes put out I've got all this done
[1:18:51] because I've I've walked contrary to the
[1:18:53] Covenant
[1:18:54] but Lord my hair is growing back out
[1:18:57] I want I want to renew him
[1:19:00] can you say Amen
[1:19:04] Hallelujah
[1:19:05] you never lose the Covenant
[1:19:10] you lose the blessings but never the
[1:19:14] Covenant
[1:19:15] he saw you he ordained you he called you
[1:19:21] out and he is faithful to that call
[1:19:27] now you've been acting like an old
[1:19:30] poop you're the one acting like an idiot
[1:19:32] but God and you're going to have to
[1:19:35] suffer for your wrongs but God is
[1:19:39] faithful to his word and the Holy Spirit
[1:19:43] is a witness
[1:19:46] oh you Holy Ghost filled folks should be
[1:19:49] excited that God gave you a covenant
[1:19:58] Hallelujah
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:01] so it's not the fact that I'm raised in
[1:20:03] church it's not the fact that I can sing
[1:20:05] songs it's not the fact that I'm a
[1:20:06] preacher
[1:20:07] it's a fact the fact is
[1:20:09] that My Sacrifice has been accepted
[1:20:12] and the Holy Spirit has come back upon
[1:20:14] me
[1:20:15] and empowered me
[1:20:18] again go back and read go back and read
[1:20:21] John
[1:20:22] go back and read from the Passover and
[1:20:25] he starts I mean just the that's all
[1:20:28] he's talking about for the next 24 hours
[1:20:34] making a covenant
[1:20:36] I'm coming back to you
[1:20:39] the comforter is going to be with you
[1:20:41] you won't see me you won't be able to
[1:20:42] ask me
[1:20:43] that you'll ask the father in my name
[1:20:48] I'm going to do this the comforter is
[1:20:51] going to come the guide's going to come

[1:21:20] he's gonna be a reprover too when you're
[1:21:21] wrong

[1:21:24] well praise the Lord

[1:21:36] Lord that thy judgments are right and
[1:21:38] that thou in faithfulness Hast Afflicted

[1:21:52] lose your eyesight

[1:26:39] you know what that's telling me
[1:26:41] that's a pretty vast deal there
[1:26:43] the benefits of a faithful God
[1:26:46] to his children
[1:26:48] is I'll always forgive you
[1:26:51] I'll always heal you
[1:26:53] and I'll always redeem you
[1:26:56] I'm there with you you're my pride
[1:26:59] that's my promise unto you are you
[1:27:01] hearing me I am not saying that I am not
[1:27:04] I'm not saying the truth might have
[1:27:06] broken bones and and hurt marriages and
[1:27:09] you might have and you I
[1:27:14] you are I am there
[1:27:21] I'm faithful
[1:27:24] I'm faithful
[1:27:26] when I'm not faithful he's faithful when
[1:27:29] you're not faithful he's faithful
[1:27:32] when you've reached your limit he's
[1:27:33] Limitless
[1:27:36] when you say I can't he says I can
[1:27:40] say out there's no way he says how
[1:27:43] things are possible
[1:27:45] can you say man
[1:27:47] he's faithful
[1:27:52] praise the Lord
[1:27:55] he's faithful he's faithful in
[1:27:56] correction
[1:27:57] and he's going
[1:27:59] he's going to correct
[1:28:02] but it's had is correction
[1:28:05] as the scripture says it's a man as the
[1:28:09] Apostle Paul says there in Hebrews
[1:28:11] he says your father's they correct you
[1:28:13] for a they correct you for a few days
[1:28:16] to their own pleasure Amen in other
[1:28:19] words you make him mad and amen there
[1:28:22] makes them feel a little better amen
[1:28:28] but God's not looking at you the same
[1:28:30] way he's looking at the outcome
[1:28:33] and and every every one of the dads in
[1:28:36] here I know they're looking at the
[1:28:37] outcome but sometimes it's a relief amen
[1:28:40] for everyone
[1:28:42] give you a paddle occasionally and say
[1:28:44] ha amen
[1:28:47] okay maybe I shouldn't say that amen
[1:28:50] but God always
[1:28:53] has a purpose
[1:28:56] he says now you've given respect
[1:28:59] unto your fathers who've done it
[1:29:02] in the flesh
[1:29:04] how much more respect
[1:29:06] should we give the father of spirits
[1:29:09] who has called us
[1:29:12] ordained us
[1:29:13] given us life
[1:29:16] can you see man
[1:29:19] no
[1:29:24] the Covenant that he's made with us
[1:29:30] is a covenant that
[1:29:37] you can look at
[1:29:41] and you should be able to go back to
[1:29:43] that Covenant
[1:29:45] and that's the reason why
[1:29:48] we don't want to say
[1:29:50] I've received the Holy Ghost
[1:29:52] because you shouted
[1:29:55] received the Holy Ghost because
[1:29:58] I
[1:30:00] felt good in a church
[1:30:02] you want to make sure
[1:30:04] that the life of God
[1:30:06] comes upon you and fills you
[1:30:11] that you know that you know because the
[1:30:14] trying days are going to come
[1:30:17] and when those trying days come you're
[1:30:20] going to be able to go back and say
[1:30:23] I remember the day
[1:30:25] I remember the time
[1:30:27] I remember him changing me
[1:30:31] changed my
[1:30:33] thoughts
[1:30:34] change my attitudes
[1:30:37] his divine grace took over in me
[1:30:41] and he's living his life through me
[1:30:45] amen are y'all catching me
[1:30:48] the holy spirit is a very real spirit
[1:30:54] and he's got very real power
[1:31:01] the same one that anointed to Jesus with
[1:31:04] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:06] and he healed the sick and he raised the
[1:31:08] dead and is now living inside you don't
[1:31:10] tell me that the Holy Spirit don't have
[1:31:12] power within you you have the power
[1:31:21] no
[1:31:24] he knows
[1:31:27] I think of this little
[1:31:31] this
[1:31:33] poem judge not the Lord by feeble sense
[1:31:38] but trust him for his grace
[1:31:42] behind a frowning Providence hides a
[1:31:44] smiling face
[1:31:46] ye fearful sir are you fearful Saints
[1:31:49] fresh courage take
[1:31:51] the cloud G so much dread or Rich with
[1:31:54] mercy and shall break in blessings
[1:31:57] or your head
[1:32:01] you see he knows the way that I take
[1:32:05] the scripture says there in Psalms 1 and
[1:32:07] 6 the Lord knoweth the way
[1:32:11] of the righteous
[1:32:14] they're in the Book of Job
[1:32:17] job had said
[1:32:20] thou knowest
[1:32:22] or he knoweth the way that I take and
[1:32:25] when he hath tried me
[1:32:29] I shall come forth
[1:32:31] as pure gold
[1:32:34] can you see man
[1:32:36] you see
[1:32:38] brother Branham would say
[1:32:44] job was not looking at his own abilities
[1:32:49] he had a covenant with God it was a
[1:32:51] blood Covenant with God
[1:32:54] and so he said that when
[1:32:56] when the enemy was coming in or when God
[1:32:59] allowed the devil to try him
[1:33:03] job could stand there
[1:33:07] by his sacrifice
[1:33:10] and he could say
[1:33:13] God
[1:33:14] will be faithful
[1:33:22] he told me
[1:33:25] to slay a lamb and that lamb would
[1:33:27] represent me and my children
[1:33:31] he could stand there and say
[1:33:34] God
[1:33:35] is faithful
[1:33:40] he says you can do the same when the
[1:33:43] enemy is coming against you and and
[1:33:46] hitting your health
[1:33:47] striking your family
[1:33:49] hitting one way or the other
[1:33:53] your friends might all be saying huh
[1:33:55] you're a secret sinner ha you God's
[1:33:59] punishing you
[1:34:01] but brother Branham says
[1:34:04] that's not always the case at all
[1:34:07] that you can stand right there though
[1:34:10] you're being Afflicted in your body
[1:34:12] stand right there by the ashes of that
[1:34:15] lamb
[1:34:16] stand right there on that ass sheep and
[1:34:18] say God
[1:34:22] I made Covenant with you
[1:34:28] I'm telling you that Covenant is
[1:34:29] powerful
[1:34:31] it made Covenant with you
[1:34:32] standing there on that ass ship you
[1:34:34] could say that healing belongs to me
[1:34:39] the salvation of my children belonged to
[1:34:42] me I am standing here in the for the my
[1:34:47] lamb was presented unto you
[1:34:53] and you know what
[1:34:57] God is faithful
[1:35:01] now you might be in tried
[1:35:03] you might be tried pretty pretty sorely
[1:35:06] right now
[1:35:07] but don't you give up confidence and
[1:35:10] don't you give up hope
[1:35:11] stand right there
[1:35:13] stand right there at that blood Covenant
[1:35:15] stand right there and say I
[1:35:17] will trust in God
[1:35:23] I've got a covenant with him he's made a
[1:35:26] covenant with me he appeared to me he
[1:35:29] gave me the lamb he said you can trust
[1:35:32] in me and I'm standing here
[1:35:39] laughs
[1:35:42] you don't know
[1:35:44] you don't know that God's bragging on
[1:35:46] you
