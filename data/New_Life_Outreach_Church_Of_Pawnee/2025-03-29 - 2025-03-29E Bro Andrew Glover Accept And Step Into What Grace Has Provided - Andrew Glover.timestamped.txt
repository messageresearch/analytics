[1:04:27] only two ways that a man can go he said
[1:04:30] that's the right way and that's the
[1:04:32] wrong way he said and all of us here
[1:04:34] tonight we're on those roads the right
[1:04:36] or the wrong one see amen there's no
[1:04:38] middle ground for Jesus said amen that
[1:04:41] you cannot serve God and Mammon which he
[1:04:44] was meaning the world so we're either
[1:04:46] right amen or we're wrong now if we'll
[1:04:49] just get away from our own way amen is
[1:04:52] the only way we can get into God's way
[1:04:55] amen the only way that we can get into
[1:04:57] God's way amen is we have got to get out
[1:05:00] of Our Own Way amen God bless you
[1:05:02] brother Duran it's good to see you
[1:05:04] tonight amen the only way we can get out
[1:05:06] of our way is to get into God's way amen
[1:05:10] and God has made a provided way for
[1:05:13] everything he has provided the way and
[1:05:16] where we get in trouble is not following
[1:05:18] the way and injecting into it our own
[1:05:21] way see and that makes a perversion and
[1:05:24] anything that's perver verted amen is
[1:05:27] not Dependable anything amen that is
[1:05:30] perverted is not Dependable amen so God
[1:05:33] has a way can we establish that right
[1:05:35] now amen that God has a way I'll say
[1:05:39] this that man always injects amen his
[1:05:43] way into God's way I want to go on
[1:05:45] record and say tonight that God's ways
[1:05:48] amen they are perfect amen I love what
[1:05:50] Solomon said in Proverbs 14:12 when he
[1:05:53] said there is a way amen with which
[1:05:55] seeth right unto a man amen but the end
[1:05:59] thereof are the ways of death amen there
[1:06:02] is a way that seeth right unto man amen
[1:06:05] but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:06:07] death so that tells me young people that
[1:06:10] there is a connection between the way
[1:06:11] you're in and the destination that
[1:06:14] you're headed for listen there is a big
[1:06:16] difference in something that seeth right
[1:06:19] amen and knowing that something is Right
[1:06:21] amen I'll say this denominations are
[1:06:23] walking Amen in the way which seeth
[1:06:26] right unto a man amen they baptize in a
[1:06:29] way that seems right unto their Bishop
[1:06:31] amen they have communion in a way that
[1:06:33] seeth right amen unto their leaders or
[1:06:36] unto their unto their unto their presb
[1:06:38] or under their their their uh what shall
[1:06:40] I say their jurisdiction amen but I want
[1:06:42] to tell you young people amen as the
[1:06:45] Bride of Jesus Christ we are not like
[1:06:48] denominations amen that are walking
[1:06:50] without an absolute amen they have to so
[1:06:53] because they don't have an absolute amen
[1:06:55] they have to choose which way seems
[1:06:57] right amen so this way seems right to
[1:07:00] baptize and this way seems right to
[1:07:02] receive the Holy Ghost amen but let me
[1:07:04] go on record tonight and say we're not
[1:07:06] choosing amen which way is Right amen we
[1:07:09] are telling you which way is Right amen
[1:07:11] and the way that's right is the way of
[1:07:13] God he said see you've got to come amen
[1:07:16] not the way that seems right amen but
[1:07:19] the way that God says is Right amen and
[1:07:22] that is the way of the Cross amen I'll
[1:07:24] say this we're not not walking without
[1:07:26] an absolute we are walking with an
[1:07:29] absolute and anybody that studies what a
[1:07:31] prophet said he said if you got an
[1:07:33] absolute you're headed for a paradox
[1:07:36] amen and you know what a paradox is amen
[1:07:38] it is something that is incredible it is
[1:07:41] hard to explain amen it cannot be
[1:07:43] explained amen but yet it is the truth I
[1:07:46] want to put every devil and Hell on
[1:07:48] notice tonight amen that this is not a
[1:07:50] denominational young people amen that is
[1:07:53] walking in a way amen that seeth right
[1:07:55] under some leader hey but this is the
[1:07:57] Bride of Jesus Christ and she has heard
[1:08:00] the sermon an absolute and she is
[1:08:02] walking with an absolute amen and I'm
[1:08:04] just going to say it we're going to walk
[1:08:06] right into a miracle tonight we're going
[1:08:08] to walk right into a paradox tonight I
[1:08:11] believe there's some young people here
[1:08:12] tonight amen that's going to walk into a
[1:08:15] greater hour in their life than they've
[1:08:17] ever seen before they're going to walk
[1:08:19] into a victory that they thought would
[1:08:21] never happen listen I refuse to back up
[1:08:24] amen and start walking with a way that
[1:08:26] seems right I have heard amen the
[1:08:29] sounding of the seventh angel and he
[1:08:31] said if there's an absolute then it's
[1:08:33] Unlimited in power and there's nothing
[1:08:36] it cannot do I want to put every demon
[1:08:38] of condemnation every demon of guilt
[1:08:41] every demon of anxiety every demon of
[1:08:43] cancer every demon of complexes every
[1:08:46] demon of pornography every demon of
[1:08:48] perversion I want to put that devil on
[1:08:51] notice tonight hey we have an absolute
[1:08:54] and because we have an absolute solute
[1:08:56] we will not back up to your pressures we
[1:08:58] will not back up to your fear we know
[1:09:00] who we are we are the sons and daughters
[1:09:03] of God and God has positionally placed
[1:09:06] Us in the way that is right my the way
[1:09:11] that God says his right is the way of
[1:09:13] the word he said that's what the
[1:09:15] Christian needs today in this atomic age
[1:09:17] in this time of uncertainty you need
[1:09:20] something besides just experience of
[1:09:22] joining Church you need an anchor you
[1:09:25] need an absolute you know because
[1:09:27] churches will fail and people will fail
[1:09:30] hey but Christ cannot fail and he is the
[1:09:34] absolute Amen to the believer well since
[1:09:36] I got the microphone I might as well
[1:09:38] just preach amen there was a little idea
[1:09:40] went around amen that the message is not
[1:09:42] the absolute amen I'll go ahead and say
[1:09:45] it amen that is an intellectual idea
[1:09:47] that's trying to crucify amen the
[1:09:50] potential of a paradox Amen in this
[1:09:52] generation listen a prophet said that
[1:09:55] that woman's absolute was the prophet
[1:09:57] and he said his absolute was God if you
[1:10:00] take this prophet's message as your
[1:10:03] absolute it's the same as taking God as
[1:10:06] your absolute because this is not the
[1:10:08] word of a man it's not the Declaration
[1:10:10] of a bishop it is thus saith the Lord
[1:10:13] that has been revealed in the hour that
[1:10:16] we're living in yes sir if you can read
[1:10:19] in the scripture that's something Christ
[1:10:21] has ordained or commissioned us to do
[1:10:23] and because there some twisting around
[1:10:25] someone tell you oh that was for the
[1:10:27] disciples or that's for someone else
[1:10:29] amen then don't you hold on to that amen
[1:10:32] if you do amen Christ is not your
[1:10:35] absolute can I say this he said the
[1:10:38] person who led you out of the way amen
[1:10:40] is your absolute but if that word glory
[1:10:44] to God if that word which is Christ
[1:10:46] still holds then he is your absolute and
[1:10:49] we mustn't let anything stir us amen out
[1:10:52] of the way of the word listen we are not
[1:10:55] walking in our choice we are walking in
[1:10:59] God's choice prophet of God said those
[1:11:01] denominational ages of 900 and something
[1:11:03] different Protestant denomination each
[1:11:06] one claims that they are the truth and
[1:11:08] that they have the truth and that the
[1:11:10] people that belong to those churches
[1:11:13] amen they should believe that now listen
[1:11:15] because they have Stak their Eternal
[1:11:18] destination upon the teaching of that
[1:11:20] church and there's so much different one
[1:11:23] from the other till it makes 900 in
[1:11:25] something different questions amen every
[1:11:28] denomination amen creates a question on
[1:11:31] the word of God he said therefore being
[1:11:33] 900 and something different questions
[1:11:35] there's got to be one correct answer and
[1:11:37] I would like for us tonight being that
[1:11:39] we're trying to go to heaven and to meet
[1:11:42] our lord Jesus who we all love amen I
[1:11:44] would like to search in the scripture
[1:11:46] Amen to find that answer oh Church of
[1:11:49] the Living God hey there is a there
[1:11:52] there is an announcement to be made
[1:11:54] every person under the sound of my voice
[1:11:56] amen has a destination and I'll say this
[1:11:59] as a Believer my destination is not
[1:12:02] tribulation my destination amen is not
[1:12:05] hell I did not come from Hell therefore
[1:12:08] I cannot go back to hell I did not well
[1:12:11] I might as well preach I have come from
[1:12:14] God and I must go back to
[1:12:16] God so that's why I study this message
[1:12:20] is I want to figure out about the place
[1:12:22] I'm
[1:12:23] going I've often told the story I was I
[1:12:26] was in a meeting one night we got done I
[1:12:27] had the final service and the brother
[1:12:29] just got done preaching and the guy come
[1:12:31] up to me he said brother Andrew he said
[1:12:33] going to be hard for you to preach in
[1:12:34] the morning he said after all these
[1:12:36] preachers you got to find something to
[1:12:37] say I said well I got the message it's
[1:12:39] unlimited you know and he said well he
[1:12:41] said I'll tell you one thing ain't
[1:12:43] nobody preached on is hell he said you
[1:12:45] ought to just preach on hell I said well
[1:12:47] I would but I don't know much about it
[1:12:49] he said what do you mean you never took
[1:12:51] time to study it I said why would I
[1:12:53] waste my time amen trying to figure out
[1:12:56] about somewhere I ain't never going I
[1:12:58] didn't come from hell I ain't going back
[1:13:00] to hell but I do have a sermon called
[1:13:03] The Rapture and I do have a sermon
[1:13:05] called things that are to be and I do
[1:13:07] have a sermon called the future home of
[1:13:10] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:13:12] bride if I'm going to study anything I'm
[1:13:15] going to study about the streets of gold
[1:13:17] that I'm going to walk on if I'm going
[1:13:19] to study about anything I'm going to
[1:13:21] study about the Merit supper of the Lamb

[1:13:37] the lamb and there ain't nobody can take
[1:13:39] your seat it's there and it's sealed and
[1:13:43] it's predestinated unto
[1:13:45] you if we're going to study about an
[1:13:48] answer let's study about where we're
[1:13:51] going we're going to heaven
[1:13:56] well we might as well shout that devil
[1:13:57] out of the building we're going to
[1:14:00] heaven we're going in the Rapture we're
[1:14:03] going in the Millennium we're going in
[1:14:05] the future home we're going where the
[1:14:07] devil's not going wo Glory we're going
[1:14:12] church we're going to
[1:14:14] Glory now the prophet said don't you be
[1:14:17] afraid no matter how many atomic bombs
[1:14:20] how many hydrogen bombs how much they
[1:14:22] speak of this and that's going to happen
[1:14:24] don't you be scared
[1:14:25] God's at the will he just knows how to
[1:14:28] steer amen listen so we don't have one
[1:14:31] thing to fear but be just a lovely
[1:14:33] little Carefree child who is looking up
[1:14:36] to the father every minute and is
[1:14:38] depending on him to lead us and to guide
[1:14:41] us now listen to this and to take us
[1:14:45] into our destination by his grace Oh

[1:14:53] our destination
[1:14:55] by our
[1:14:57] works by our abilities by how much we
[1:15:01] know or how how much we memorized or
[1:15:03] what church we go to or who our daddy is
[1:15:05] or who our pastor is no he's going to
[1:15:08] take us into our destination by his
[1:15:13] grace listen if there's a Bible question
[1:15:16] then there should be a Bible answer I
[1:15:18] want to tell you tonight we have the
[1:15:20] answer Amen to the devil's question what
[1:15:23] is the answer to the devil's question
[1:15:25] question it is that he Christ is risen
[1:15:28] and has already paid the price and is
[1:15:31] raising up the body he said the devil's
[1:15:33] howling his wickedness his scheme has
[1:15:36] been uncovered amen by the Risen
[1:15:38] resurrected Christ in the headship over
[1:15:41] his body brother B says it like this he
[1:15:43] says in there there would come a time
[1:15:45] forth when he would Express himself in
[1:15:48] the fullness of his godhead amen deity
[1:15:50] through his church having the
[1:15:52] preeminence in the church he said what
[1:15:55] the anointed man amen but now the
[1:15:58] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[1:16:01] anointed bride and the bridegroom amen
[1:16:04] anointed by what by accepting what Eve
[1:16:08] and Adam turned down listen the coming
[1:16:11] back with the anointing of the word
[1:16:13] because he said my word is spirit see
[1:16:16] Anointed with the word listen Church
[1:16:19] what Eve turned down he comes back and
[1:16:22] we accept what Eve turn turn down will
[1:16:26] come back and there will be a second Eve
[1:16:28] who will be married to the second Adam
[1:16:31] and she will accept oh God she will
[1:16:34] accept what the first eve
[1:16:36] took can I say it when she turned it
[1:16:39] down she went out but when you accept it
[1:16:42] you go back in woo Glory what she turned
[1:16:45] down caused her to have to walk outch
[1:16:48] but what you accept is going to have to
[1:16:50] cause you to put on your walking shoes
[1:16:53] and start walking back into to the
[1:16:55] paradise of God where the power of God
[1:16:57] is unlimited by the restrictions of
[1:17:00] unbelief hallelujah what what Adam and
[1:17:03] Eve turned down is going to come back
[1:17:06] and we're going to accept I look at this
[1:17:08] word provided it means to make available
[1:17:11] for use it means to supply it means to
[1:17:14] equip or to supply someone even with
[1:17:17] something that is useful or necessary I
[1:17:20] love this it means to make adequate
[1:17:22] preparation for a possible
[1:17:25] event when you provide something you're
[1:17:28] making adequate preparation amen for a
[1:17:31] possible event can I say what a prophet
[1:17:34] said he said God's provided way is the
[1:17:37] best way he said for a chicken to get
[1:17:39] out of a shell he said God provided an
[1:17:42] instrument he said so that chicken just
[1:17:44] pecks his way out brother types that
[1:17:46] pecking his way out Amen to the amening
[1:17:49] of the word y'all know that amen he
[1:17:52] types amen the pecking of the chicken
[1:17:54] coming out of the shell Amen to the
[1:17:57] amening of the word of God that's why
[1:17:59] the devil wants to silence the amens in
[1:18:02] the house of God he don't mind if you
[1:18:04] clap he don't mind if you nod he don't
[1:18:07] mind if you give a thumbs up amen sorry
[1:18:10] but just don't say amen amen because the
[1:18:12] minute you begin to say Amen is the
[1:18:15] minute you begin to claim what you're
[1:18:17] hearing as the personal property of your
[1:18:20] life listen I'll say this I claim this
[1:18:23] message I'm going to say
[1:18:25] I claim this meeting I claim this prayer
[1:18:27] line I claim this atmosphere I claim
[1:18:30] these men of God I claim the anointing
[1:18:33] of God I claim it for the power and the
[1:18:35] manifestation and the demonstration of
[1:18:38] God I don't give it over to the
[1:18:41] devil I claim this not for miracles I
[1:18:44] claim this not for deliverances I claim
[1:18:47] this not for Transformations I claim
[1:18:49] this night for another Upper Room
[1:18:52] experience where the Holy Ghost fell and
[1:18:54] they got so drunk on God that they
[1:18:56] forgot what their name was they forgot
[1:18:58] where they come from they forgot their
[1:19:00] problems and they remember their creator
[1:19:02] and they remember they can do all
[1:19:06] things through him that strengthens them
[1:19:10] I pray we get so drunk on God we forget
[1:19:13] everything God's provided way is the
[1:19:17] best way brother B said that's a lesson
[1:19:19] to us that God will provide that's a
[1:19:23] lesson church God will provide there's
[1:19:27] no need of us getting all upset about
[1:19:30] anything God will provide it well
[1:19:34] brother Zachary ain't no need to get
[1:19:36] nervous ain't no need to get worked up
[1:19:39] we have a God who will provide it he
[1:19:43] said God always recommends to his people
[1:19:46] his believing children Amen to always go
[1:19:50] in his provided way now let me say this
[1:19:53] God amen provided a way for Israel amen
[1:19:57] which was the best you you agree the way
[1:20:01] that God provides amen is the best way
[1:20:04] he said now that way was Moses a prophet
[1:20:07] that was going to lead them amen to the
[1:20:10] promised land but he was not going to
[1:20:12] lead them by his abilities he was not
[1:20:14] going to lead them amen by what he
[1:20:16] thought but he was going to lead them by
[1:20:19] a god-given promise can I show you
[1:20:21] something here when God sends a prophet
[1:20:24] he does not build amen his church upon
[1:20:27] that prophet he builds his church upon
[1:20:30] the word of the Lord that comes to that
[1:20:32] Prophet which becomes the leadership
[1:20:34] because listen if God would have built
[1:20:36] Israel on Moses when Moses died they
[1:20:39] would have never went any further but
[1:20:41] because he was building it upon thus
[1:20:44] sayith the word there was a Joshua who
[1:20:46] could arise when Moses went off the
[1:20:49] scene well I might as well say it
[1:20:50] tonight Heen don't you ever build
[1:20:52] anything on a preacher because he could
[1:20:54] be here today and he could be gone
[1:20:57] tomorrow he could be here this minute he
[1:20:59] could be gone the next but you build
[1:21:01] your future build your hopes upon the
[1:21:04] message of the hour because God will
[1:21:07] never allow this inside word to fall to
[1:21:10] the ground he will never allow prophecy
[1:21:13] Amen to fail in utter failure but God
[1:21:16] will raise up an Aly rat he'll raise up
[1:21:18] a young
[1:21:20] person glory to God well I might as well
[1:21:23] preach I'm feeling good we've had some
[1:21:25] guys that got so big in Preachers and
[1:21:27] they thought they could say anything do
[1:21:29] anything preach anything and one day
[1:21:31] they woke up and I'll just say it they
[1:21:33] were stupid to think they had a Ministry
[1:21:35] without a
[1:21:36] prophet sorry Timothy it just come out
[1:21:38] he amen amen somebody say why somebody
[1:21:41] leave the message well that's Timothy
[1:21:42] I'll tell you this am meant they were
[1:21:44] crazy because they thought they could do
[1:21:46] something without this anointed word can
[1:21:49] I tell you something God has set down
[1:21:51] well-known preachers amen that turned
[1:21:53] against this message and he's raised up
[1:21:56] young people that's got the guts Amen to
[1:21:58] say what a prophet
[1:22:01] said he sat down important people who
[1:22:04] thought they were so great that the
[1:22:06] church couldn't go on without him and
[1:22:07] he's raised up nobody's on the Backwoods
[1:22:10] of nowhere cuz all he needs is somebody
[1:22:13] that'll just say what a prophet said and
[1:22:16] let it become the leadership of the
[1:22:19] lives hey I'm talking about leading by
[1:22:22] the word brother said they were going to
[1:22:24] the promised land they were coming out
[1:22:26] of a chaos they were coming out of a
[1:22:28] chaos and they were going into a
[1:22:31] Promised Land what were they doing they
[1:22:33] were going from the ridiculous to the
[1:22:36] sublime they were going by a promise
[1:22:39] brother J they were not going by their
[1:22:41] feelings they were not going by Moses's
[1:22:43] feelings they were going to the promised
[1:22:46] land amen by a promise that God would
[1:22:49] lead them there you know we find that in
[1:22:51] the scripture that there was a god of
[1:22:53] the old test
[1:22:55] and the Bible actually says that his
[1:22:56] name was Jehovah I love what the prophet
[1:22:59] says he says what he appeared as God
[1:23:01] Amen to the human race in the beginning
[1:23:04] he has to continue on Amen under those
[1:23:06] names and under that provision if he
[1:23:09] didn't then he certainly told something
[1:23:11] that was wrong when he appeared to the
[1:23:14] human race and said that's what he was
[1:23:17] and look what you'd make God then you
[1:23:19] would make him just a man you would make
[1:23:21] him a liar now brother Bram tells this
[1:23:23] very beautiful in the message of Grace
[1:23:25] 1960 or 61 he says I was out there
[1:23:28] praying and he said this Revelation came
[1:23:31] to me he said here's what it was I could
[1:23:34] not figure out amen the Jehovah and
[1:23:36] Jesus he said but then the voice spoke
[1:23:39] and said look the Jehovah of the old is
[1:23:42] the Jesus of the new heard brother say
[1:23:45] today he said the same breath that said
[1:23:47] let there be is the same breath that
[1:23:50] said he that believeth on me amen has
[1:23:53] passed from death un life and shall not
[1:23:55] come into condemnation listen Saints
[1:23:58] Jehovah don't have one breath and Jesus
[1:24:00] another it's the same breath the same
[1:24:03] breath in Jehovah is the same breath in
[1:24:05] Jesus is the same breath in the seventh
[1:24:08] angel well I might as well go ahead and
[1:24:10] say it it's the same breath in every man
[1:24:13] of God who will say what a prophet said
[1:24:16] and when you begin to hear the Breath of
[1:24:18] God in all to ignite something on the
[1:24:19] inside of your heart to begin to believe
[1:24:22] God and to begin to back the word of
[1:24:24] I think it's time hey I think it's time
[1:24:27] right now to look that devil square in
[1:24:29] the face and say I'm coming out of it
[1:24:31] I'm coming out of it youve tried to bind
[1:24:34] me youve tried to hold me youve tried to
[1:24:36] restrict me but in the name of the Lord
[1:24:39] I believe that God is here and I'm
[1:24:41] coming out of
[1:24:43] it I'm coming out of it I'm coming out
[1:24:46] of it I'm coming out of it amen the
[1:24:49] Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the
[1:24:52] new he's the Jehovah of our prise he
[1:24:55] appeared in he has to remain that
[1:24:57] because he introduced himself to the
[1:25:00] human race by the names of Jehovah
[1:25:04] brother said it very beautiful he said
[1:25:06] now God his attitude toward the people
[1:25:08] somebody say God's
[1:25:10] attitude from or towards the people I
[1:25:13] love this brother Wendell amen from Eden
[1:25:16] Back to Eden is wrapped in those seven
[1:25:19] Redemptive names so God's attitude
[1:25:23] towards you young people people is in
[1:25:25] the names of Jehovah I want to tell that
[1:25:29] devil tonight we're on our way back to
[1:25:32] Eden because the Jehovah of the
[1:25:35] old is the Jesus of the new listen and
[1:25:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:25:43] and forever somebody ought to shout and
[1:25:45] thank God that his attitude never
[1:25:47] changes don't that make you feel good
[1:25:50] amen to know that the attitude of God it
[1:25:53] never changes what God thought of you in
[1:25:55] the beginning is what he'll think of you
[1:25:57] in
[1:25:58] the come on this ain't to love me today
[1:26:01] hate me tomorrow thank I'm good today
[1:26:02] think I'm bad tomorrow listen God's
[1:26:05] attitude is wrapped in his
[1:26:07] characteristic which is the fact that he
[1:26:09] can never change the way he thinks about
[1:26:12] one of his own children now when we
[1:26:14] start talking about Jehovah amen you all
[1:26:16] know one of the most famous uh one of
[1:26:18] the most famous Redemptive names of
[1:26:20] Jehovah is what Jehovah Gyra when you
[1:26:23] think of Jehovah
[1:26:24] you automatically think of Jehovah Gyra
[1:26:27] because the Bible said that God told
[1:26:29] Abraham he said Abraham I want you to go
[1:26:32] up on the on the mountain and I want you
[1:26:34] to sacrifice amen Isaac your son now I
[1:26:37] just want to say this there was
[1:26:39] something inside of Abraham's heart
[1:26:41] because when he looked there I love said
[1:26:44] today he said he didn't even tell his
[1:26:45] wife he was taking her son to kill
[1:26:47] him it's like brother Daryl Ward said
[1:26:50] one time he said Mama leaves you in
[1:26:51] charge of babies and he said we was at a
[1:26:53] fair one time time and he said Ally got
[1:26:55] lost and he said Of All Times mama calls
[1:26:57] us when baby's lost and says how's
[1:26:59] things going and you say
[1:27:02] wonderful he didn't tell he he didn't
[1:27:05] tell Sarah I'm going to kill Isaac but
[1:27:07] said but what he done was he walked out
[1:27:09] there and he said when he looked at them
[1:27:11] he said I and the lad will go Yonder and
[1:27:14] worship now I love what he said he said
[1:27:16] and I and the lad will return he didn't
[1:27:19] say we might come back he didn't say
[1:27:22] there's a chance we're going to come
[1:27:23] back he said the place we're leaving
[1:27:25] we're going to return to it and it's not
[1:27:28] just going to be me it's going to be
[1:27:30] Isaac with me also now come on church
[1:27:33] that tells me something you know what it
[1:27:34] tells me brother Samuel it tells me that
[1:27:36] Abraham knew somewhere between here and
[1:27:39] there I'm going to meet something that's
[1:27:42] going to allow me to come back
[1:27:44] here he had confidence in the ability of
[1:27:47] God that he was able to provide
[1:27:50] something that would allow him to bring
[1:27:52] Isaac back and he said I and the lad
[1:27:54] will go Yonder and worship and I and the
[1:27:56] lad will return now brother said Abraham
[1:27:58] got up there on the mountain and he laid
[1:28:00] Isaac upon the Altar and he said there
[1:28:02] he lays him out and he takes that knife
[1:28:05] and he said he raises his hand up and
[1:28:07] he's getting ready to come down and slay
[1:28:09] Isaac and he said a voice Thunders out
[1:28:12] and says stay thy hand Abraham he said
[1:28:15] stay thy hand said what happened he said
[1:28:18] God looked at him and he said see and
[1:28:20] thou has not withheld thy son amen my
[1:28:22] only son I know you love me because you
[1:28:25] obey me he said see God wasn't looking
[1:28:29] for Abraham's son he was looking for
[1:28:31] Abraham's obedience because all God
[1:28:34] wanted was obedience can I tell you that
[1:28:37] tonight young people all God is looking
[1:28:39] for is obedience he's just looking for
[1:28:43] somebody who is big enough to Humble
[1:28:45] themselves and obey his word see
[1:28:48] obedience is what God wants can I say
[1:28:51] this obedience produces more than we
[1:28:53] realize
[1:28:54] the pro of God said what is it he said
[1:28:56] this little faith woman this bride of
[1:28:58] Christ she is an obedient woman he said
[1:29:01] because she knows what he wants done
[1:29:03] with his word he said Abraham lifted up
[1:29:06] his eyes and he looked over there and
[1:29:08] behind him was a ram that was caught in
[1:29:11] the thickets ream said look here in
[1:29:13] Genesis 22:14 I believe Abraham called
[1:29:15] the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as
[1:29:18] it is said to this day in the Mount of
[1:29:21] the Lord it shall be seen I want to I
[1:29:24] want to I want to show you something
[1:29:26] Abraham is up here on top of the
[1:29:28] mountain there's no water there's no
[1:29:30] vegetation there's nothing there Amen to
[1:29:33] produce the I mean there's nothing there
[1:29:36] Amen to produce the healing I mean there
[1:29:37] there's nothing there to produce a
[1:29:39] miracle I mean sorry there's nothing
[1:29:41] there to produce a ram but Abraham looks
[1:29:44] over there and he said there's a ram I
[1:29:47] love what the prophet said he said how
[1:29:49] could a miracle I mean how could a ram
[1:29:51] ever get there he said the text expl
[1:29:54] claims it I'm having fun he's Jehovah
[1:29:56] Gyra what he done was he spoke the ram
[1:30:00] into existence he said see it was not a
[1:30:02] vision amen it was a materialization it
[1:30:05] was not just an idea up there on the
[1:30:08] mountain it was a reality of the faith
[1:30:10] of Abraham's
[1:30:12] heart I'm just going to go ahead and say
[1:30:14] what he said he said if God has made a
[1:30:16] promise then God can provide the thing
[1:30:20] for the promise if God made the promise
[1:30:23] then God can provide the thing for the
[1:30:25] promise heard him say today he said God
[1:30:28] don't write a check until he's first
[1:30:30] made a deposit and he said if there's a
[1:30:32] check WR to you it's cuz there's some
[1:30:34] money somewhere to back it up wo glory
[1:30:37] to God and you got a Bible and it's full
[1:30:39] of 600 promises and the only reason it's
[1:30:42] been open to you is because there's a
[1:30:44] bank account in heaven and there's
[1:30:46] enough funds in there to back up every
[1:30:48] promise there's enough funds to save
[1:30:50] your family there's enough funds to save
[1:30:52] your children there's enough funds to
[1:30:54] heal your body there's enough funds to
[1:30:56] get you out of time back into eternity
[1:30:59] there is enough funds young people to
[1:31:01] pay your way amen from one dimension
[1:31:04] into another
[1:31:06] dimension can I say it to you write the
[1:31:10] check write the check the money's
[1:31:13] already in the
[1:31:17] bank now brother said it very beautiful
[1:31:21] he said he looked around there and God
[1:31:22] fulfilled his promise now he said God is
[1:31:25] able this morning to send his power in
[1:31:27] his midst of the Holy Ghost in here he
[1:31:30] saidy true Messenger from God believes
[1:31:32] that and you know what he does he holds
[1:31:34] on to it any true Messenger of God
[1:31:38] believes that Jehovah
[1:31:41] Gyra is still Jehovah and he holds on to
[1:31:45] that and he preaches it to the people he
[1:31:48] tells them that the God who is speaking
[1:31:50] to them is able to fulfill his promise
[1:31:54] he said now you say how can it happen he
[1:31:56] said now look here brother Brandon the
[1:31:58] doctor said I had cancer and he told me
[1:32:01] I was going to die he said I got 30 days

[1:32:26] literally move that cancer what is going
[1:32:29] to come down here and literally move

[1:32:46] for it it's from Brother Bram and it's
[1:32:48] real deep okay you ready I don't know
[1:32:55] I'm reading you what he said he said I
[1:32:57] don't know but God promised it and God
[1:33:00] can provide something to do
[1:33:02] it I don't know how he's going to do it
[1:33:06] but I know he promised it and if he gave
[1:33:08] Abraham a ram if he gave Sarah a baby if
[1:33:11] he gave Hannah a child if he gave B
[1:33:14] barus his son that same God is not in a
[1:33:17] tomb in Jerusalem he is right here in
[1:33:20] the power of his resurrection he is here
[1:33:23] he is here to fulfill the promise of his
[1:33:25] word listen there may not even be enough
[1:33:28] faith in your heart to believe to raise
[1:33:30] your hands but there is a God in heaven
[1:33:33] who can come down into your
[1:33:37] heart and he can create a faith in you
[1:33:42] to believe what your five inner
[1:33:45] senses and your five outer senses will
[1:33:49] never declare he is just as much Jehovah
[1:33:52] Gyra right
[1:33:55] now I read that right sister lilan he's
[1:33:58] just as much Jehovah Gyra right now as
[1:34:02] he was then he still Jehovah Gyra the
[1:34:06] Lord will provide himself away to make
[1:34:10] his word come to pass glory to God the
[1:34:15] Lord will provide himself a way to make
[1:34:18] his word come to pass now let me say
[1:34:21] this to you here's the here's the beau
[1:34:23] beautiful thing about it is this Ram
[1:34:25] comes into existence okay and I've I've
[1:34:27] often said it like this there was the
[1:34:29] ram you know what Abraham never did he
[1:34:32] never walked around amen and said
[1:34:34] there's the ram he never walked around
[1:34:37] and said hey Isaac look at the ram
[1:34:39] there's a ram do you see that Ram it's a
[1:34:42] good Ram do you see that Ram it's a
[1:34:44] powerful Ram Isaac do you see that Ram
[1:34:47] that Ram wasn't there 30 minutes ago but
[1:34:50] it's here right now look Isaac it's a
[1:34:52] strong Ram amen as long as he would have
[1:34:55] walked around amen looking at that Ram
[1:34:57] it would have never benefited amen the
[1:35:00] reason he was up on the mountain in
[1:35:02] order for that Ram or that fulfilled
[1:35:05] promise to benefit his life he had to
[1:35:07] walk over
[1:35:09] there he had to step into
[1:35:13] it he had to walk into it and he had to
[1:35:17] go over there and he had to pick it up
[1:35:19] well can I say this the Seven Seals are
[1:35:22] open Saints the Third is here the word
[1:35:25] has been revealed and it's never going
[1:35:27] to benefit you amen walking around and
[1:35:29] saying look what God done for brother
[1:35:31] brandom look what he done for brother
[1:35:32] Tim look what he done for brother sea
[1:35:34] look what he done for brother Wendell
[1:35:36] look what he done for brother bisc look
[1:35:37] what he done for brother Ron look what
[1:35:39] he done for brother Timothy look what he
[1:35:41] done for brother Ronnie it's never going
[1:35:42] to benefit you but if it's going to
[1:35:45] benefit you you've got to accept the
[1:35:47] Revelation that it's not just for that
[1:35:49] generation it's for this generation I'll
[1:35:52] say it as plain as I know to this is not
[1:35:54] an adult's message this is not a senior
[1:35:57] citizen message this is not a baby's
[1:35:59] message this is a believer's message if
[1:36:02] you're 5 years old or 500 years old if
[1:36:05] you can believe it you can receive the
[1:36:07] benefits of
[1:36:12] it I'm telling you this message is the
[1:36:16] ram in the bushes amen it's the
[1:36:19] Deliverance for your needs when brother
[1:36:21] B comes along in 19 1900s and he begins
[1:36:24] to say there's a way of God he said now
[1:36:26] the way of God Amen was to lead them by
[1:36:28] cloud of Fire by prophetic utterance by
[1:36:31] miracles signs and god-given wonders how
[1:36:34] many knows that God has provided the way
[1:36:38] you know what the way is it's the way of
[1:36:40] Salvation it's the way of healing it's
[1:36:43] the way of Deliverance it's the way of
[1:36:45] transformation it's the way of Victory I
[1:36:48] say this folks it's not a way it's the
[1:36:52] way and the way is a person and the
[1:36:55] person is Jesus Christ and he said I am
[1:36:58] the way I am the truth and I am the life
[1:37:02] and no man cometh unto the father but by
[1:37:04] me so in other words Christ is the way
[1:37:08] but here's the question how do you get
[1:37:10] into Christ he said now there is his
[1:37:13] body but by one Spirit we're all
[1:37:15] baptized into one body the body of
[1:37:18] Christ now listen which has already been
[1:37:21] judged
[1:37:24] well if anybody got a right to use that
[1:37:26] term you can't judge me God Can Judge Me
[1:37:29] is the
[1:37:30] bride anybody got a right to walk around
[1:37:33] and say you ain't can't judge you're
[1:37:34] exactly right we've already been judged
[1:37:37] because we are in the body of Christ he
[1:37:40] said see so we are free from judgment do
[1:37:44] you realize this message amen has
[1:37:46] transported you amen from Death unto
[1:37:49] life and I can say to you tonight by the
[1:37:52] power of the blood and by the grace of
[1:37:54] almighty God we shall never come into
[1:37:57] judgment or condemnation because of the
[1:38:00] grace of God that has been released in
[1:38:02] this
[1:38:04] generation now you say brother Andrew
[1:38:06] how in the world do I as a young person
[1:38:09] have access to God well brother R said
[1:38:11] it beautiful he said go back to what
[1:38:13] Paul said he said through the priesthood
[1:38:15] of Christ amen I'm going to pick up in
[1:38:17] Hebrews 10:19 having therefore Brethren
[1:38:19] weakness and cowardice and ashamed and
[1:38:22] and humility and humil ation and am I
[1:38:25] reading that right having
[1:38:30] boldness having boldness to enter into
[1:38:33] the Hol of holies by the blood of Jesus
[1:38:35] listen young people you ought to have
[1:38:37] some boldness about
[1:38:39] you you ought to get some grit about you
[1:38:41] you ought to quit being a dis rag for
[1:38:43] the devil and get some boldness about
[1:38:47] you some boldness to enter in by the
[1:38:50] grace of God listen how are we're going
[1:38:52] to enter in we're going to enter in by a
[1:38:54] new and the living way brother said
[1:38:56] that's not the Old Law he said which he
[1:38:58] have consecrated for us through the veil
[1:39:00] that is to say his flesh I love this he
[1:39:03] said by a New and Living Way that was a
[1:39:06] that was the dead way and it was an
[1:39:08] order of law not the old way but now we
[1:39:11] enter by grace are you hearing me now
[1:39:14] somebody say with me now we enter by
[1:39:17] grace through the Holy Spirit nothing
[1:39:21] you can do the law was works it was
[1:39:24] touch not handle not taste not eat no
[1:39:26] meat keep sabbaths amen new moons all
[1:39:29] this thing but it was done for us by
[1:39:31] Grace we just accept it see Christ takes
[1:39:34] away the sin we believe it we hear the
[1:39:37] gospel we believe it accept it and then
[1:39:40] if we truly accept it from the depths of
[1:39:42] our heart God gives us the Holy Ghost as
[1:39:45] a witness he said then when the devil
[1:39:47] seen that he had made him go off break
[1:39:49] through anyhow then let them open other
[1:39:51] channels he said they'll either be f FCS
[1:39:53] or there'll be a bunch of starches but
[1:39:55] let me let me just go ahead and get it
[1:39:56] out there and say this we're not
[1:39:59] Fanatics and neither are we
[1:40:03] starches we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:40:06] Christ listen we're not here amen
[1:40:09] underneath a bunch of laws listen this
[1:40:11] is not

[1:41:16] is rest in the faith in the finished
[1:41:18] work and any gift that says any can I
[1:41:21] preach now
[1:41:23] any gift that says anything different
[1:41:25] from that don't you believe it cuz it's
[1:41:28] not of God cuz there is where the price
[1:41:32] was paid cause there is where the price
[1:41:37] was paid there is where everything was
[1:41:39] finished right there didn't our brother

[1:42:25] left their body and there's one on the
[1:42:27] right who looks over at him and brother

[1:42:34] even thought about God his entire
[1:42:38] life his entire life he had never
[1:42:41] thought about God but when he was in

[2:03:06] man I've already had a Red Sea
[2:03:10] [Applause]
[2:03:11] experience I've already had a Red Sea
[2:03:13] experience I was a 12-y old boy when I
[2:03:16] had
[2:03:17] mine I'm just I'm just going to punch
[2:03:19] that devil square in the face brother
[2:03:22] Timothy if the devil could have stopped
[2:03:24] me he would have when I was a little
[2:03:25] 12-y old boy my first Youth Camp bugging
[2:03:28] the fire out of you and falling you
[2:03:30] everywhere but I went there wanting the
[2:03:31] Holy Ghost amen I'd never been in a
[2:03:33] prayer line before and I walked up there
[2:03:35] and brother Tim through it God bless his
[2:03:37] heart amen standing there in the prayer
[2:03:39] line I always thought when you went up
[2:03:41] there you told the preacher what you
[2:03:42] wanted little and I know God already
[2:03:44] told him what I
[2:03:46] needed he already told him what I needed
[2:03:49] and as a 12y old boy didn't hardly have
[2:03:51] no education had a mama that believed
[2:03:54] this message had a grandmother to raised
[2:03:56] me in church and my mama that didn't
[2:03:57] have a daddy that cared didn't have a
[2:03:59] hardly anything but I had a father and
[2:04:02] his name is Jehovah and the Jehovah of
[2:04:04] the old is the Jesus of the new and
[2:04:07] there's one thing I can say God bless my
[2:04:09] mama tonight there's one thing I can say
[2:04:11] about her is she taught me this amen all
[2:04:14] the struggles we went through she taught
[2:04:16] me this one thing God is able to do
[2:04:18] anything he's able and I tell you this
[2:04:20] she said this this message is the truth
[2:04:23] regardless of what any man says and as a
[2:04:25] 12-year-old boy I walked up in the
[2:04:28] parine and I looked up to tell brother
[2:04:30] Tim what I wanted and before Mark I
[2:04:32] could open my mouth he laid his hand on
[2:04:34] me and said in the name of Jesus fill
[2:04:37] him with a holy ghost listen I went in
[2:04:40] one
[2:04:41] way but when I woke up I come out
[2:04:44] another way you say preacher you don't

[2:18:19] Holy Ghost I've done a a program it's
[2:18:22] called Jesus Christ and he's the same
[2:18:24] yesterday today and forever I said thank

[2:18:30] the Lord that was years ago and here we
[2:18:33] are tonight on a platform telling you it
[2:18:36] don't matter what you come from it don't
[2:18:38] matter where you started if you'll just
[2:18:40] surrender to God he'll open the windows
[2:18:43] of heaven and he'll put you in places
[2:18:45] that nothing else will ever put
[2:18:47] you he'll put you in dominion over

[2:19:11] great-grandfather come in the message
[2:19:13] later in his years but his early years
