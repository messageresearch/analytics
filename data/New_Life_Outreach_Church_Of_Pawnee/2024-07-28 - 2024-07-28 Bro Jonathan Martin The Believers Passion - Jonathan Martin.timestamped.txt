[58:42] tell you it's becoming more and more
[58:44] clear to us just what a great hour that
[58:48] we're living in and I think of what the
[58:52] prophet said in the sermon why Christ
[58:54] speak
[58:56] that when Moses seen scripture being
[58:59] fulfilled it anointed his faith and I I
[59:03] tell you friends we are living in a an
[59:07] hour where scripture is made plain and
[59:09] clear before us and the Word of Promise
[59:11] is so made manifest before us it it's
[59:17] it's anointing our faith and um I tell
[59:20] you I I don't know about you but my
[59:22] faith is just climbing Higher and Higher
[59:25] and greater and greater greater and I
[59:27] tell you we're living in in a time of
[59:30] great
[59:31] possibilities where God is among us to
[59:34] fulfill his word and uh we just deem it
[59:38] a great uh privilege to be here with you
[59:41] and definitely wish it was under uh
[59:44] different circumstances and uh we've
[59:48] been just greatly uh saddened by the
[59:50] passing of Alba Jo and uh we just we
[59:54] glad we were able to come and uh just to
[59:57] share our love for sister Thalman
[1:00:01] brother Michael and uh you know just to
[1:00:04] convey our hearts we're just uh so uh
[1:00:09] just uh think of uh think of them uh
[1:00:12] very dearly and uh just got wonderful
[1:00:16] wonderful times of not just memory but a
[1:00:20] great love in our hearts for this family
[1:00:23] and um I know that God's got a great
[1:00:27] Embrace he's a great comforter and and
[1:00:31] uh he he makes everything perfect in in
[1:00:34] his time and his season and and uh God's
[1:00:38] you know God don't make mistakes and no
[1:00:42] and uh I believe that you know we've got
[1:00:45] to believe that uh We've we've got to uh
[1:00:48] have confidence in God's great love and
[1:00:51] and that God doesn't make mistakes Satan
[1:00:54] never gets a good one over on God and uh
[1:00:58] so we just hold to uh the word with all
[1:01:02] that is within us and you know I thought
[1:01:04] brother Michael just did a tremendous
[1:01:06] job and uh just over the the different
[1:01:10] things that I was uh able to see on
[1:01:14] Friday and and Saturday and uh brother
[1:01:17] Wendell did a just an outstanding job on
[1:01:20] the sermon and it was just tremendous
[1:01:22] and uh I know that your love that you
[1:01:25] have expressed to uh not only sister
[1:01:28] thelman and brother Michael but also
[1:01:31] just the family and the the this
[1:01:33] community it's both uh seen and felt and
[1:01:37] uh it's a great witness it's a it's a
[1:01:40] tremendous witness I think that you can
[1:01:42] never you can never uh I I can't
[1:01:45] remember how exactly Paul says but uh
[1:01:49] never get tired and well doing and uh I
[1:01:52] know that God God sees it but also the
[1:01:56] the community sees it as well and uh
[1:01:59] they're watching you know they're
[1:02:02] they're always watching and uh it's a
[1:02:04] great privilege to be able just to be
[1:02:06] the light uh be a light be his light and
[1:02:10] so uh if you have your Bibles I
[1:02:16] uh will turn over to just a a few
[1:02:19] different places but we'll turn over to
[1:02:22] Hebrews the uh third chapter and
[1:02:27] I uh
[1:02:31] just praying and trying to get direction
[1:02:34] for this morning
[1:02:36] and I just kept coming back
[1:02:39] to uh just a a little something that we
[1:02:44] have been uh been preaching on there at
[1:02:48] the home church and uh we just pray that
[1:02:51] it'll be uh uh an encouragement and a
[1:02:54] blessing to you yes for this morning and
[1:02:58] um I would like to uh take for a text
[1:03:02] the believer's
[1:03:04] passion and uh we'll just uh read
[1:03:07] Hebrews 3 And1 and also Zephaniah 3 and9
[1:03:12] and then 1 Corinthians 13 And1 and um it
[1:03:17] is sure good to have my family and I
[1:03:19] appreciate my wife singing and just a
[1:03:22] wonderful song and so good to be here
[1:03:24] with my brothers and uh just love
[1:03:27] brother Shawn brother Wendell uh verily
[1:03:29] dearly and hold them in high respects
[1:03:32] and and uh high regards as great men of
[1:03:35] God and uh but Hebrews the 3D chapter
[1:03:39] the first
[1:03:40] verse wherefore holy Brethren partakers
[1:03:45] of the Heavenly calling consider the
[1:03:49] Apostle and high priest of our
[1:03:52] profession Christ Jesus now that word
[1:03:55] profession is the same as confession and
[1:03:59] so we've got to consider the Apostle and
[1:04:03] high priest of our confession who is
[1:04:07] Christ Jesus now Zephaniah the 3 chapter
[1:04:11] the 9th
[1:04:14] verse for then will I turn to the people
[1:04:18] a pure
[1:04:20] language that they may all call upon the
[1:04:23] name of the Lord to to serve him with
[1:04:26] one consent and so notice what we're
[1:04:29] going to do when our hearts are turned
[1:04:31] back to a pure language we're going to
[1:04:34] call upon the name of the Lord and we
[1:04:37] know who his name is it's the Lord Jesus
[1:04:40] Christ and we're going to serve him with
[1:04:43] one consent Now 1 Corinthians 13 and
[1:04:48] verse
[1:04:51] 11 when I was a child I spake as a child
[1:04:56] I understood as a child I thought as a
[1:04:59] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:05:04] childish things now may God just add the
[1:05:08] blessings to the reading of the word you
[1:05:10] can have your
[1:05:12] seats the believer's passion and I
[1:05:16] believe that the passion of the believer
[1:05:18] is the word of God and uh we know that
[1:05:23] Jesus said that heavens and earth will
[1:05:25] pass away but uh my word shall not pass
[1:05:30] away we uh read there in Isaiah that uh
[1:05:34] where it's promised that the word will
[1:05:37] not return void but it shall accomplish
[1:05:40] that which it was sent to do we know
[1:05:43] that the word of God is not the words of
[1:05:46] a man it is not just mere uh formalities
[1:05:50] it's not just uh randomly speaking it's
[1:05:54] not just a random promise that with good
[1:05:57] intents we we try to fulfill it and a
[1:06:00] lot of times we uh we find ourselves
[1:06:02] falling short of that but we know that
[1:06:05] the word of God is has the creative
[1:06:09] power of God to enforce that word to
[1:06:12] bring it to pass and God is not just
[1:06:15] randomly speaking something but he
[1:06:18] speaks it with purpose he speaks it with
[1:06:20] intent and so when he speaks that word
[1:06:24] then he's got something in his vision
[1:06:27] it's he's got something in his in his
[1:06:29] mind and we know that what a what a word
[1:06:32] is is a thought expressed and God has
[1:06:36] never had any new thought about anything
[1:06:39] uh but he speaks his eternal thoughts
[1:06:43] and it's with intent that that word
[1:06:46] would be made manifest so I believe we
[1:06:50] should have a passion for Christ and his
[1:06:54] promises espe
[1:06:56] uh the Vindicated word for this day as
[1:07:00] we realize that God predestinated a word
[1:07:03] for every age and then he predestinated
[1:07:08] Believers uh to believe that word for
[1:07:11] that age and we understand that Noah's
[1:07:14] uh if we were preaching simply trying to
[1:07:17] preach Noah's message it wouldn't have
[1:07:19] an effect upon us we tried to ple uh
[1:07:22] preach Moses message even uh Jesus
[1:07:25] message in his day it would have effect
[1:07:28] upon us but we have got to be passionate
[1:07:32] about the word for this day for it to
[1:07:35] have effect in our lives and and that's
[1:07:39] our desire isn't it we we want to see
[1:07:42] the word have effect we we don't want to
[1:07:45] just simply be Christians and name only
[1:07:47] we don't want to be church members we
[1:07:50] don't want to just simply come and
[1:07:52] listen to uh a wonderful sermon uh
[1:07:55] regardless of how great the preacher is
[1:07:58] this is more than just a lecture this is
[1:08:00] more than just a uh uh a sermon coming
[1:08:04] across like a passionate speech uh and
[1:08:07] there are people Gathering uh you know
[1:08:10] thousands of people uh gather around to
[1:08:13] hear a a a passionate uh Speech and my
[1:08:17] it gets them you know it gets them
[1:08:19] energized it gets them excited to go and
[1:08:22] do things maybe start a business or help
[1:08:24] them out in their business or help them
[1:08:27] out in their marriages help them out
[1:08:28] raising their children there there's a
[1:08:31] seems like there's a passionate speech
[1:08:34] for anything but that's not what we're
[1:08:38] talking about we're talking about the
[1:08:40] word of God that has the power of the
[1:08:44] spirit behind it in it to bring it to
[1:08:48] manifestation in our lives and so this
[1:08:52] is more than just uh you know uh saying
[1:08:55] well being passionate about the word and
[1:08:58] then just going out going through our
[1:09:00] days and wondering you know wondering
[1:09:02] how we're going to overcome and
[1:09:04] wondering how we're going to get healed
[1:09:06] and wondering what the solution is to
[1:09:09] our marriage problems and wondering
[1:09:10] about this and that and no the word is
[1:09:14] the answer the word is the answer
[1:09:17] because it has the creative power to
[1:09:20] enforce that word in the heart of the
[1:09:23] believer and so there's going going to
[1:09:25] be many people that actually are just uh
[1:09:29] holding to the word with a very casual
[1:09:32] faith and and uh you know they have
[1:09:35] faith in God they love God they believe
[1:09:38] God as far as they can go but they're
[1:09:40] very casual with it but I don't think
[1:09:43] that we should be casual with the word
[1:09:46] of God I I think that we you know we
[1:09:49] should treat the word of God as the
[1:09:51] absolute as the final say the final
[1:09:54] authority over every situation in our
[1:09:58] lives say and you know that word casual
[1:10:01] actually means relaxed and
[1:10:04] unconcerned indifferent apathetic
[1:10:07] uncaring
[1:10:08] uninterested and we find that you know
[1:10:11] the prophet of God would actually preach
[1:10:13] some sermons titled convinced then
[1:10:17] concerned and so you know casual is
[1:10:21] meaning unconcerned well then we should
[1:10:24] be passionate
[1:10:26] by uh about the Revelation that we have
[1:10:29] received in this hour meaning we should
[1:10:31] be convinced of what God has done in
[1:10:35] this hour and what it does for us it
[1:10:38] makes us concerned when we see what is
[1:10:41] happening in our government when we see
[1:10:43] what is happening in our in our
[1:10:46] communities when we see it's just become
[1:10:48] a public Stripes all around us and it's
[1:10:51] another Sodom and gomorra and all of
[1:10:53] these things then it should make us
[1:10:55] concerned amen it it should make us
[1:10:58] concerned about one another it should
[1:11:01] make us concerned about our church it
[1:11:03] should make us concerned about our
[1:11:05] families it should make us concerned
[1:11:08] amen that what we are doing with this
[1:11:12] gospel is pleasing go to God that we're
[1:11:14] handling the word right that we're we're
[1:11:17] doing what is the will of God in this
[1:11:21] age Amen in our lives because you see uh
[1:11:25] the prophet of God would tell us amen
[1:11:28] that it is Jesus Christ that is among us
[1:11:31] today isin't that right amen we're not
[1:11:33] in the presence of your pastor we're not
[1:11:35] in the presence of just good church
[1:11:37] people but we're actually in the
[1:11:39] presence of Jesus Christ himself what is
[1:11:44] Jesus Christ well he's the same
[1:11:46] yesterday today and forever and then uh
[1:11:50] the prophet would tell us in the token
[1:11:53] he would tell us that that Luther knew
[1:11:56] this day would come and Wesley knew this
[1:11:59] day would come and and and and he would
[1:12:01] say finny and Calvin and name all of
[1:12:04] those uh reformers knew the pillar of
[1:12:08] fire would return to the church to lead
[1:12:12] the church and brother bradam would say
[1:12:14] that this is the token age we've just
[1:12:17] went through a couple of marriages and
[1:12:19] you know I I my daughter got married and
[1:12:22] uh brother Sea's daughter an got married
[1:12:25] married and and they enter into a
[1:12:28] covenant and then as you as they enter
[1:12:31] into this Covenant then you ask what do
[1:12:35] you have what what token can you show me
[1:12:39] that this Covenant is coming into effect
[1:12:42] and and then they turn around and say
[1:12:44] well I've got a ring and that ring is a
[1:12:46] symbol of Eternity and you slip that
[1:12:48] ring upon their fingers and it is a
[1:12:51] token of the vows the Covenant that they
[1:12:55] that they just made with one another and
[1:12:58] brother Brandon would say that the token
[1:13:00] could not be preached in any other age
[1:13:03] but in the evening time what is the
[1:13:05] evening light the word made manifest the
[1:13:09] promise made reality and when the
[1:13:13] Covenant is come back into full view
[1:13:17] then there is a token required to as a
[1:13:21] as a something that you can have that
[1:13:24] God can have that
[1:13:25] you're entering into this invisible
[1:13:27] Union and the Covenant is becoming a
[1:13:30] reality in your life and in your homes
[1:13:33] and in your church and and and you have
[1:13:36] that token well the prophet of God would
[1:13:38] say the token is the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:42] Ghost so we are convinced that we are
[1:13:46] living in the token age where the
[1:13:49] Covenant has returned back into full
[1:13:52] strength amen we we could say like this
[1:13:55] we've had the mechanics we've had the
[1:13:58] word we we we we we've had good sermons
[1:14:01] but we are living in the age that the
[1:14:05] Dynamics have come to the mechanics that
[1:14:08] we have believed and now it is becoming
[1:14:12] a reality it's come into manifestation
[1:14:16] you know what that shows us that we
[1:14:18] can't just be casual about these things
[1:14:21] we we we can't just treat these things
[1:14:23] as another church service and and and uh
[1:14:27] just uh just something else that we're
[1:14:29] going through uh in life I I you know
[1:14:32] let maybe I can put it a little bit like
[1:14:34] this I was hearing to I I was I was
[1:14:37] listening to the prime minister of
[1:14:40] Israel uh Netanyahu and and he was
[1:14:43] giving his speech to Congress the other
[1:14:46] day and I told my wife I said listen to
[1:14:49] this man because it's not just another
[1:14:51] politician it's not just another speech
[1:14:54] it's someone that realizes that he
[1:14:58] doesn't have a choice if he if he caves
[1:15:01] into Congress if he caves in to our
[1:15:04] president if he caves in to to the
[1:15:06] pressures of the world then there are
[1:15:09] influences at work that would completely
[1:15:13] annihilate not only him not only his
[1:15:16] family but would annihilate Israel off
[1:15:18] of the map he does not have the luxury
[1:15:22] to just be casual with this speech he
[1:15:26] does not have the luxury to just treat
[1:15:29] this as a vacation he came with a
[1:15:33] passion to convey to Congress we need
[1:15:37] your weapons we need you we we we don't
[1:15:41] we you're getting them to us but we need
[1:15:43] them faster if you'll get those weapons
[1:15:46] to us faster we'll defeat the enemy
[1:15:48] faster well I you know he was passionate
[1:15:51] about that I I tell you I think of how
[1:15:54] David his father Jesse thought that he
[1:15:57] was just sending him to his Brethren to
[1:15:59] give him some cheese and see how the
[1:16:01] battle is going but when David got on
[1:16:04] the scene he seen his Brethren hiding
[1:16:07] behind rocks and he heard this great
[1:16:10] giant this Goliath this uncircumcised
[1:16:13] Philistine making his boast and his
[1:16:15] Brethren hiding and saw the man they're
[1:16:18] following who is Head and Shoulders
[1:16:20] above everyone he's hiding in his tent
[1:16:22] behind the lines and David looks around
[1:16:25] and he says is there not a cause amen
[1:16:29] who is this uncircumcised Philistine you
[1:16:32] see he came to give some cheese but he
[1:16:35] came with a passion that the same God
[1:16:39] that met me on the backside of the
[1:16:40] desert the same God that defeated the
[1:16:43] lion defeated the bear is the same God
[1:16:47] that I have a token I am an
[1:16:50] uncircumcised Israelite that I am still
[1:16:53] following the pillar of fire I have met
[1:16:56] that Pillar of Fire I am anointed by the
[1:16:59] prophet I am anointed to defeat demons
[1:17:02] in my life amen he went with a slingshot
[1:17:05] of Faith because he didn't have a choice
[1:17:10] this was not a luxury and Friends any
[1:17:14] True Believer and they are anointed to
[1:17:18] to to to defeat the Devil and we are
[1:17:21] living at the breaking the entering the
[1:17:24] pressuring in of the tribulation period
[1:17:27] we don't have the luxury to just be
[1:17:30] casual with the word we have received
[1:17:33] the word we have received what we need
[1:17:36] to bypass the tribulation to cross over
[1:17:40] those Waters uh and enter into another
[1:17:43] dimension another land uh I tell you the
[1:17:45] word that we preach is the faith
[1:17:48] released into the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:51] to bring a passion Amen to defeat
[1:17:54] sickness to I tell you if someone is
[1:17:57] sick amen they're passionate about being
[1:18:00] well they realize amen that if they're
[1:18:03] going to get well they're going to have
[1:18:04] to fight the devil amen they can't take
[1:18:07] a vacation they cannot just put it off
[1:18:10] just another day it's between life and
[1:18:13] death and I tell you when you get
[1:18:15] passionate that I am the god that Health
[1:18:18] all of thy diseases then what you are
[1:18:20] doing is you are declaring war upon the
[1:18:23] Devil I'm going to fight you I'm going
[1:18:26] to fight you in the on the I'm going to
[1:18:28] fight you on land I'm going to fight you
[1:18:30] on Shore in the sea I'm going to fight
[1:18:33] you on the mountain I'm going to fight
[1:18:35] you on the valley I'm going to fight you
[1:18:36] wherever I'm going to fight you whether
[1:18:38] I feel like it I'm going to fight you
[1:18:40] whether I it doesn't matter I am in a
[1:18:45] battle yes sir
[1:18:48] Hallelujah so there you know I I've been
[1:18:51] feeling a little bit like David here
[1:18:53] lately is there not a
[1:18:56] cause hallelujah amen when we when we
[1:19:00] see the enemy all around us poking his
[1:19:02] head up and and trying to defy the
[1:19:04] armies of the Living God I I I feel in
[1:19:08] my heart that there is a cause to stand
[1:19:11] for the word and preach it preach it
[1:19:13] with conviction preach it with passion
[1:19:16] preach it as the prophet gave it to us
[1:19:19] you see I I think of how that Columbus
[1:19:23] amen it says that the prophet of of God
[1:19:25] says you remember that little story
[1:19:27] about Columbus and he says uh
[1:19:30] Christopher Columbus was given ships by
[1:19:32] the queen of Spain because in his heart
[1:19:36] he saw a vision that the world was round
[1:19:38] and he had hardly a way he could prove
[1:19:40] it he had nothing to do with but he was
[1:19:43] a man of vision he believed it and when
[1:19:45] the ship was given to him with a bunch
[1:19:47] of prisoners cowards that was his church
[1:19:50] members a bunch of pullbacks a bunch of
[1:19:53] a bunch that was discouraged and tried
[1:19:55] to discourage him just a little while
[1:19:58] longer and we'll drop off the world a
[1:20:00] serpent Will Rise From the Bottom of the
[1:20:02] Sea and wrap these little ships and pull
[1:20:04] it to the Bottom now say Brave Rover say
[1:20:08] what will you say he said sell on Sail
[1:20:12] on Sail On and On oh God give us men in
[1:20:16] the church like that I don't care what
[1:20:19] the scientific world says I don't care
[1:20:21] what the denominational world says I
[1:20:23] Take God at his word and sail on Sail on
[1:20:26] until you pass the barrier we used to in
[1:20:29] the old church here used to sing this
[1:20:31] little song like this I've cross the
[1:20:33] separating line I've left the World
[1:20:36] Behind if there ever was a time that the
[1:20:39] church needs to step across that line
[1:20:41] which separates you between faith and
[1:20:43] unbelief by sight and looking at the in
[1:20:45] unseen by faith it is now Hallelujah you
[1:20:51] see if there ever was a time it is is
[1:20:55] now amen to be a people of vision to be
[1:20:59] following what God has already
[1:21:02] Vindicated to be the word of the Lord
[1:21:05] I'll say it like this that we are living
[1:21:08] off the evidence of the land the son of
[1:21:12] man the word made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:21:15] Us in this hour we are living off the
[1:21:19] evidence that it's a good land
[1:21:21] hallelujah it's a good land heaven is is
[1:21:24] there it's a real word it's a real power
[1:21:27] it's a it's a real Christ it's There's
[1:21:30] real angels we're bumping into those
[1:21:32] angels we're bumping it it's produced a
[1:21:35] feeling within us it's it's produced an
[1:21:37] emotion within us it's produced a joy
[1:21:40] within us it's it's produced a peace
[1:21:42] within us amen what is it is the
[1:21:45] evidence of another land and I declare
[1:21:49] it's not something that we're Desiring
[1:21:51] it's something we're eating on it we're
[1:21:53] eating on Divine Healing we're eating
[1:21:56] upon renewing and refreshing from the
[1:21:59] presence of God we are feeding upon the
[1:22:02] pomegranates and the grapes and and all
[1:22:05] of the things that God has promised his
[1:22:07] bride in the last days in this land of
[1:22:10] the Holy Ghost we are possessors of a
[1:22:14] good land I tell you what I tell you
[1:22:17] what happened amen the devil got the
[1:22:20] people discouraged over there in Egypt
[1:22:24] and God got them so tied up in Egypt
[1:22:26] that when Grace came their way and Grace
[1:22:29] provided a prophet and Grace provided
[1:22:31] the pillar of fire then all of these
[1:22:33] symptoms of well you know the waters are
[1:22:36] bitter and all of these symptoms and
[1:22:39] well you know there's a red sea and
[1:22:41] symptoms of well what are we going to do
[1:22:44] about you know food and what about this
[1:22:47] and what about that symptoms just
[1:22:49] symptoms and God would come down and he
[1:22:51] would deliver them from those symptoms

[1:22:56] Water he'd rain Mana from Heaven he he
[1:22:59] would provide Quail that they they
[1:23:01] because they got tired of of of that
[1:23:03] Mana from Heaven amen and God was always
[1:23:07] trying to get them past the symptoms
[1:23:09] just get them over into Faith get them
[1:23:12] over to what it really meant following
[1:23:14] the pillar of fire that I'll never leave

[1:23:27] to come a dispensation change they they
[1:23:30] had to fall they had to change Ministry
[1:23:34] they had to go from law to this idea
[1:23:37] that you've got something to do with it
[1:23:39] and they had to go on in to Joshua which
[1:23:42] is a type of this present day Ministry
[1:23:44] of the Holy Ghost and they had to follow
[1:23:48] the Holy Ghost into the inheritance and
[1:23:51] there they can realize it's not by my
[1:23:54] words it's not by my ability it never
[1:23:58] has been about my symptoms uh it's
[1:24:01] always been about the finished work of
[1:24:04] Calvary it's always been he paid the
[1:24:07] price to redeem me back to my
[1:24:10] inheritance and I am following this Holy
[1:24:13] Ghost uh I am following the captain of

[1:24:36] one of them is just another symptom
[1:24:39] jebusite is just a symptom do you
[1:24:42] realize the prophet of God would say
[1:24:44] that that I I believe he said it kind of
[1:24:46] like this he says that that symptoms are
[1:24:49] the worst thing that God has to deal
[1:24:51] with amen if he can get us past our
[1:24:55] symptoms do you know that weary is a
[1:24:58] symptom do you know that mind battles

[1:25:08] oppression do you do you realize that
[1:25:10] those are symptoms do you realize how
[1:25:13] you feel in your body is just only one
[1:25:16] kind of a symptom amen but those
[1:25:19] thoughts that are telling you you can't
[1:25:20] possess and you're not good enough and
[1:25:23] you're really not an overcome and do you
[1:25:25] realize that that are that was the
[1:25:28] thoughts that kept 2 million people in
[1:25:31] that Pentecostal Wilderness and they
[1:25:34] everyone perished amen but you see there
[1:25:37] was a Joshua and a Caleb amen they steal
[1:25:40] the people can you imagine amen they
[1:25:43] were so possessed with the revelation of
[1:25:47] of the grace of God upon their lives
[1:25:50] that when two million people begin to
[1:25:53] listen to 10 preachers that were
[1:25:56] preaching a negative confession over the
[1:25:58] people and they begin to try to rise up
[1:26:01] and say no we're more than able don't
[1:26:03] listen to them don't listen to these
[1:26:05] preachers amen we are more than able to
[1:26:08] possess it we're we're living off of the
[1:26:10] evidence those are only symptoms uh but
[1:26:14] we are we're more than able to defeat
[1:26:16] those cancers we're more than able to
[1:26:19] defeat depression we're more than able
[1:26:22] to defeat anxiety in a nervous age we're
[1:26:26] more than able because God called us to
[1:26:30] be
[1:26:31] [Applause]
[1:26:33] Believers you see that land always was
[1:26:37] theirs the land was always theirs in
[1:26:40] God's forn knowledge God had saw it
[1:26:43] belonging to Israel so it didn't matter
[1:26:47] how many people possessed that land no
[1:26:50] matter how many pieces of paper they
[1:26:52] could hold up and say Worthy we're the
[1:26:55] inheritors we're the ones with the title
[1:26:57] deed amen you see Israel was not looking
[1:27:01] to their claims Israel was looking to
[1:27:04] what God Said through a prophet amen and
[1:27:07] they took that word and they would wave
[1:27:09] it up as their inheritance and say this
[1:27:12] is my title to that land you see it all
[1:27:16] they had never been there yet but yet
[1:27:20] God sent a prophet and said your name is
[1:27:24] on that land your name was given to you
[1:27:27] your your name was given this at Birth
[1:27:30] and your birth is tied to your position
[1:27:34] and now a prophet is declaring to them
[1:27:37] you've got to come up to a full age you
[1:27:40] got to begin to change what you're
[1:27:42] confessing you got to begin to change
[1:27:45] your speech uh your words uh and enter
[1:27:49] into what God has paid for take the land
[1:27:59] you see Caleb's confession never
[1:28:03] changed his his testimony never changed
[1:28:07] I I I I believe that Caleb held a
[1:28:09] revelation and that Revelation become a
[1:28:11] faith to him and he lived by his faith
[1:28:15] he prevailed by that
[1:28:18] Revelation amen you see he would go to
[1:28:20] Joshua and say Joshua you remember
[1:28:24] you remember what the prophet Moses said
[1:28:28] about me in that
[1:28:29] land now Joshua now now remember Caleb's
[1:28:33] the believer Joshua is the Holy
[1:28:35] Ghost and the believer is going to the
[1:28:38] Holy Ghost saying you remember the word
[1:28:41] that the prophet spoke concerning my
[1:28:44] life isn't that the position that every
[1:28:46] one of us is in that we are going to the
[1:28:49] Holy Ghost and saying you know you were
[1:28:53] there when the word was spoke you were
[1:28:56] there when he declared I'm Healed you
[1:28:58] were there when he declared that my
[1:29:00] children are saved you were there when
[1:29:02] he declared that everything on that
[1:29:04] mountain is my
[1:29:07] possession now I say Joshua give me my
[1:29:12] Mountain
[1:29:14] hallah you see Joshua the 14th chapter
[1:29:17] and I I just want to read this to you
[1:29:18] because it's it's so good for me Joshua
[1:29:21] 14 and verse 11 and 12 he's speaking to
[1:29:25] Joshua and Caleb is and he says yet as
[1:29:28] yet I am as strong this day 40 years
[1:29:31] later as I was in the day that Moses
[1:29:35] sent me as my strength was then even so
[1:29:40] is my strength now for
[1:29:44] War I want you to just weigh upon those
[1:29:48] words those two words for war he knew a
[1:29:53] man remember what kept the children of
[1:29:56] Israel amen from possessing from
[1:29:58] crossing over they were scared of those
[1:30:00] anacom they were scared of those giants
[1:30:04] amen well we we be as grasshoppers in
[1:30:07] their sight they were scared of them but
[1:30:10] here Joshua here Caleb is saying my
[1:30:14] strength is just as strong as the day
[1:30:17] that Moses sent me the same that as just
[1:30:21] as the word was prophesied over me and
[1:30:24] my family I am just as a strong those
[1:30:27] naysayers those scoffers those
[1:30:30] Hypocrites they' died off but I'm still
[1:30:34] alive uh and I am here I realize it's
[1:30:37] not going to be a cakewalk I realize
[1:30:40] that God is not just going to simply
[1:30:42] just just just go before me and and you
[1:30:44] know kill all those giants amen but you
[1:30:47] see he left those giants there for me to
[1:30:51] overcome he he he he left those shines
[1:30:54] there but you see greater is he greater
[1:30:58] is he greater is the Revelation that
[1:31:01] Christ is in our midst and he's not just
[1:31:04] in this building he's in me he's in Me
[1:31:08] Greater is the revelation of Christ in
[1:31:11] me than he that is in the
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:17] world you see Caleb is saying even so my
[1:31:21] strength now for war both to go out and
[1:31:25] to come in you see as long as you look
[1:31:29] at that mountain and you look at that
[1:31:32] and you get your wife together and you
[1:31:34] say now sweetheart ain't that beautiful
[1:31:36] what a beautiful mountain that's our
[1:31:39] possession my get the children together
[1:31:41] and say children this message now the
[1:31:46] prophet of God told me that's my
[1:31:48] mountain and I just want you to know
[1:31:50] children that you're an air with me this
[1:31:52] will never leave our family
[1:31:54] I want you to look at that mountain I
[1:31:56] want you to know that you're identified
[1:31:58] with it that's our inheritance and then
[1:32:00] they just simply get some chairs down
[1:32:02] and sit
[1:32:04] there Monday morning comes around and
[1:32:08] Tuesday comes around and they're still
[1:32:10] looking at that mountain boy isn't she
[1:32:11] beautiful Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[1:32:14] Friday year comes year goes year after
[1:32:18] year after year and they're looking at
[1:32:19] that mountain boy no we can't eat the
[1:32:22] grapes off of that land because you know
[1:32:24] well we there are giants if they would
[1:32:26] just die if those giants would just get
[1:32:29] defeated somehow God somehow God if you
[1:32:32] if you could just defeat those giants
[1:32:35] but it's ours it's our land no as long
[1:32:39] as they looked at that mountain and as
[1:32:42] long as they never declared war upon the
[1:32:45] Devil the devil would just be content
[1:32:47] just to stay right there you see the
[1:32:49] prophet of God said they're the
[1:32:51] squatters the devil's the squ water we
[1:32:55] the one with the title deed but the
[1:32:57] devil would continue to squat the devil
[1:32:59] would just stay there as long as you let
[1:33:01] him as long as you don't declare war
[1:33:03] upon the devil he'll stay there you'll
[1:33:06] stay here but you see he's going to
[1:33:08] boast on top of that mountain he's going
[1:33:10] to flex his muscles on top of that
[1:33:12] mountain he's going to yell at you from
[1:33:14] the top of that mountain and say I'm in
[1:33:17] your position ah you can't be healed you
[1:33:20] can't have the Rapture you can't have
[1:33:22] joy you don't the Holy Ghost this these
[1:33:25] things aren't for you and just keep you
[1:33:28] pushed down in your mind you're thinking
[1:33:30] I know I should get up and Declare War I
[1:33:33] know I should fight a good fight I know
[1:33:36] I'm telling my children that's our land
[1:33:38] but I'm afraid to try I'm afraid to get
[1:33:40] up and do something about it but you see
[1:33:43] that is not the spirit that was upon
[1:33:45] Caleb because Caleb confessed the words
[1:33:47] of a prophet and said that is my land
[1:33:50] and I'm declaring war upon the Devil and
[1:33:53] I have got the strength uh it's Holy
[1:33:55] Ghost strength uh it's Rapture anointing
[1:33:58] strength uh to go out and come back in
[1:34:02] I'm not going to die I'm anointed to
[1:34:04] live H I'm not anointed to die I'm not
[1:34:07] anointed to be defeated I'm not anointed
[1:34:10] to lay prostrate before these
[1:34:12] uncircumcised Giants I'm anointed to
[1:34:15] take their heads off I am anointed to
[1:34:19] conquer my Rapture conquer my
[1:34:21] Deliverance conquer my healing in fight
[1:34:24] the good fight of the revelation of this
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:31] age Hallelujah you see you got to be
[1:34:34] passionate about
[1:34:35] overcoming got to be passionate about
[1:34:37] the word your name is on that land your
[1:34:41] name is on that promise and the prophet
[1:34:44] of God and the adoption part one would
[1:34:46] say this is the age of the
[1:34:48] Overcomer the
[1:34:50] dispensation of
[1:34:52] overcoming now Paul would lay it in the
[1:34:55] scripture that we are more than
[1:34:58] conquerors through Christ Jesus who
[1:35:01] gives us strength you see that's Caleb's
[1:35:03] strength that's the believer's strength
[1:35:06] you see conqueror is someone who
[1:35:08] overcomes something it's to Prevail is
[1:35:11] to defeat an opponent and the prophet
[1:35:15] would say that each son out of each
[1:35:17] Church age overcome the temptation of
[1:35:20] that age what's the Temptation the
[1:35:22] temptation just to just to blend in with
[1:35:26] the age and don't stand for the word you
[1:35:30] see our example is Jesus isn't that
[1:35:34] right when he come to the when he come
[1:35:36] to that
[1:35:37] Wilderness and and and the Holy Ghost
[1:35:39] led him into that Wilderness and and
[1:35:42] then he's hungering and and we see how
[1:35:45] that Satan begins to tempt him and and
[1:35:49] brother Bram showed us something so
[1:35:52] powerful that that we hear it so often
[1:35:55] but I wonder if it's really resonating
[1:35:57] to us the way it should amen that the
[1:36:00] brother Bram would say he didn't use any
[1:36:03] of his power yeah he didn't he didn't
[1:36:06] use any gift but he just simply said it
[1:36:10] is written oh the power of the word and
[1:36:15] this the prophet of God was saying this
[1:36:17] is for the weakest Christian that there
[1:36:19] is in this building or in the world you
[1:36:23] don't don't have to have gifts you don't
[1:36:26] have to wait till some person comes by
[1:36:28] who prays for the sick I'll go on record
[1:36:31] because there's a tape recorder taking
[1:36:32] it here and I say this that the right
[1:36:34] mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:36:36] promise of God will bring it to pass if
[1:36:39] you can get the right mental attitude
[1:36:41] towards that Divine promise and the word
[1:36:44] of God will defeat the enemy any place
[1:36:45] anywhere at any time you see we got to
[1:36:48] fight
[1:36:50] sometime the guy the the devil the devil
[1:36:53] the guy that had the the dream and the
[1:36:55] devil kept saying boo and he and the
[1:36:57] devil kept getting bigger and he kept
[1:36:59] getting smaller and smaller and and then
[1:37:02] we find you know that that he began to
[1:37:05] think wait I I got to fight him sometime
[1:37:08] and so he took the word of God and said
[1:37:10] boo back to the devil and the devil
[1:37:13] begin to get smaller and the brother
[1:37:16] defeated the Devil by the word amen you
[1:37:20] you you see if the devil's trying to
[1:37:21] destroy your marriage you got to fight
[1:37:23] some time amen if the devil's trying to
[1:37:26] steal your children you got to fight him
[1:37:28] sometime if he's trying to take your if
[1:37:31] he's trying to take your happiness and
[1:37:32] your contentment and your joy well you
[1:37:34] got to fight him sometime and you fight
[1:37:37] him with the word of
[1:37:41] God the anointing is not an emotion but
[1:37:44] the anointing is taking the word of God
[1:37:48] and knowing how and when it's knowing
[1:37:50] how to defeat the Devil it's KN exactly
[1:37:54] what to do with the word in the very
[1:37:57] moment the moment and I tell you friends
[1:38:00] we are anointed of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:02] whether we feel it or we don't we are
[1:38:04] anointed for this age to defeat the
[1:38:07] Devil any
[1:38:09] place any conditions on any
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:16] ground but you see if you go to
[1:38:20] Revelations 5 we're not going to read it
[1:38:21] but we we know it very very much that o
[1:38:24] at the the opening of the word what was
[1:38:27] revealed was We Are Made hes we are made
[1:38:30] Hees not to just some things we are made
[1:38:33] hirs to all things we are possessors of
[1:38:37] all things but you see if you're going
[1:38:40] to possess it you're going to have to
[1:38:41] fight for it amen the uh uh the word
[1:38:45] said I've give you the land it's yours
[1:38:48] it's your possession why didn't he go
[1:38:50] over there and clean out all of the
[1:38:52] Philistines and so forth and and I'd say
[1:38:55] come on you got something to do too God
[1:38:58] just don't poke things down your neck

[1:39:34] hand come on back and got saved that's
[1:39:37] what we need you've got to do some
[1:39:40] fighting not with your fist catch it now
[1:39:43] let this so sink in your heart never
[1:39:45] forget it not with your fist but with
[1:39:48] the power of God with your testimony
[1:39:53] that's how you overcome by the blood of
[1:39:56] the lamb and your testimony tell the
[1:39:58] Devil he's got no strings tied to you
[1:40:01] you put this disease on me but Jesus
[1:40:04] Christ delivered me from it he promised
[1:40:07] it to
[1:40:08] me Hallelujah you overcome by the blood
[1:40:12] of the lamb and by the word of your
[1:40:14] testimony what is a testimony your
[1:40:17] report and the word of the Lord Isaiah
[1:40:20] 53 And1 says who ha believed our report
[1:40:24] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:40:25] revealed the prophet of God and the seal
[1:40:28] said believe the report first and the
[1:40:30] strength the arm the power of the Lord
[1:40:34] will be revealed in your
[1:40:37] life believe the report
[1:40:40] first confess the report first be a
[1:40:45] witness of this word first and then God
[1:40:49] will back you up with the strength of
[1:40:51] the Holy Ghost
[1:40:54] you see we're dealing with a defeated
[1:40:57] enemy when he was on Earth he conquered
[1:40:59] and possessed every gate the enemy had
[1:41:01] the Royal seed he promised it by the
[1:41:03] word he conquered it he conquered the
[1:41:05] Gate of sickness for us that's what he
[1:41:07] come to do he remember sick people he
[1:41:10] conquered that gate you don't have to
[1:41:12] conquer it he conquered it the other men
[1:41:15] had to conquer their own gate but you
[1:41:17] don't have to conquer it's already
[1:41:18] conquered he conquered the gates of
[1:41:20] sickness and what did he uh and what did
[1:41:22] he do when he conquered the Gate of
[1:41:24] sickness saying whatever you ask on
[1:41:26] Earth and whatever you've bound on Earth
[1:41:29] you he would bind it in heaven give us
[1:41:33] the keys to the kingdom you know what
[1:41:35] that tells me if it's already conquered
[1:41:37] if it's already defeated and he's going
[1:41:39] to bind whatever you say then you got to
[1:41:42] say what he said you've got to say the
[1:41:45] word why cry speak why do we keep coming
[1:41:49] to the border of our symptoms and not
[1:41:53] speaking and always trying to hold a
[1:41:56] conference when God has already revealed
[1:41:59] his will by his traps you are healed
[1:42:03] it's not God's will for you to be sick
[1:42:06] it's not God's will for you to have
[1:42:08] anxiety it's not for God's will for you
[1:42:12] to have
[1:42:13] nervousness it is God's will for you to
[1:42:16] have joy and speakable and full of glory
[1:42:19] and a have the peace that passive
[1:42:21] understanding dwelling within your heart
[1:42:23] it's for God's will for not the devil to
[1:42:26] pound your mind but for the word to
[1:42:30] inhabit your
[1:42:34] thoughts now he conquered death he
[1:42:38] conquered hell he conquered death and
[1:42:41] hell he conquered what the others
[1:42:42] couldn't conquer because there of the
[1:42:45] natural seed this is the spiritual seed

[1:44:47] confess things I feel like I've been too
[1:44:49] nice to the devil I I I believe these
[1:44:52] things and I I preach these things I've
[1:44:54] seen God healed amen even through my
[1:44:56] prayers and in my Ministry but I have

[1:47:37] and she says Jonathan when when do I
[1:47:41] know cuz she's been taking some thyroid
[1:47:43] medication and without it her body just
[1:47:46] goes crazy and and and fights all kinds
[1:47:50] just her mind begins to shut down and

[1:48:19] about these uh getting off the
[1:48:20] medication and things I said wait wait
[1:48:22] wait a minute we are not under law we
[1:48:26] are not playing games with the de for
[1:48:28] the devil we are don't have to prove
[1:48:30] nothing to the devil we do not have to
[1:48:33] prove that we are believers we don't
[1:48:35] have to prove nothing to him that you're
[1:48:37] healed you are healed because the word
[1:48:39] says you're healed and if you have to
[1:48:41] take that medication you continue to
[1:48:44] take that medication but when the word
[1:48:47] of the Lord drops in your heart to get
[1:48:49] off of that medication then you get off
[1:48:51] of the medication and amen you've got
[1:48:53] the backing of the Holy Ghost and I tell
[1:48:56] you I didn't even know she got off after

[1:49:03] me I it was about 4 days later she told
[1:49:06] me said Jonathan said I I feel better
[1:49:10] now than I felt when I was on the
[1:49:13] medication I tell you friends it's time
[1:49:16] to wage war on the devil I don't care I
[1:49:21] don't care I don't care for symptoms I
[1:49:23] don't care what the devil tells you it's
[1:49:26] time that you take the sword and speak
[1:49:30] speak to that mountain speak to that
[1:49:32] situation speak to those trials uh stand
[1:49:35] upon the word uh we've been restored
[1:49:38] back to a right confession right back to
[1:49:40] a pure language say what a prophet
[1:49:45] said I wish I had time to just preach
[1:49:48] these different things but I I don't
[1:49:49] have time but let me just say let me
[1:49:52] just begin to think because we've
[1:49:54] listened to the prophet so many times
[1:49:57] and how that the prophet you know this
[1:49:58] was just in his early early Christian
[1:50:00] experience and how that he had some uh
[1:50:04] some I think it was ulcers in his
[1:50:07] stomach and and and and the doctor told
[1:50:10] him says if you eat one solid food
[1:50:12] you'll die and the prophet of God seen
[1:50:14] in the word that by his stripes I am
[1:50:19] healed and he be to confess that word
[1:50:21] and said I am healed
[1:50:23] I am healed by his Tripes I am healed
[1:50:26] what was he doing he was Waging War on
[1:50:28] the devil there was a mountain that has
[1:50:30] some Giants on it but that's where his
[1:50:32] healing was so he begin to take the
[1:50:35] sword and begin to whack upon those
[1:50:37] Devils you know what happened he told
[1:50:40] his wife said you go down to the store
[1:50:41] you get me I think it is like this you
[1:50:43] you get me some beans and you get me
[1:50:45] some un onions and you give me some ham
[1:50:47] and and you make that up and and his
[1:50:50] wife said well you know one solid one
[1:50:52] solid uh uh food was going to kill you
[1:50:55] that's what the doctor said are you sure
[1:50:57] about said I am healed amen he got that
[1:51:01] food he put it to his mouth oh he says
[1:51:04] just the smell of it begin to make his
[1:51:06] his his stomach uh convulsing things and
[1:51:09] he put it down and he hit his stomach
[1:51:12] and up it come amen he he put his finger
[1:51:15] over his nose and closed his mouth and
[1:51:18] and he walk this and he swallowed it
[1:51:20] back down it went down came back up went
[1:51:24] down came back up uh went down came back
[1:51:27] up amen he finally got it to stay there
[1:51:30] until he ate the whole meal ped it up oh
[1:51:34] he was having an awful time walking the
[1:51:36] street what if they were saying Billy oh
[1:51:38] how you doing I'm doing well there he
[1:51:41] was St same symptoms same pain same

[1:51:50] you're not healed you know you're a liar
[1:51:52] amen but here but you see the prophet
[1:51:55] said I wasn't lying I was saying what
[1:51:58] the word said not what my symptom says
[1:52:01] no what my mind says I was taking my
[1:52:06] Mountain I tell you friends that's more

[1:52:25] have a positive confession even when our
[1:52:28] own body has a negative
[1:52:33] confession you see everything is
[1:52:35] defeated Hebrews 10:23 let's let's pull

[1:52:58] our lives so hold fast the confession of
[1:53:03] our faith without

[1:53:34] prophet of God says whack him if he
[1:53:36] doesn't move whack him again if he
[1:53:38] doesn't move whack him again and then
[1:53:41] Whack Him whack whack
[1:53:44] whack you got to be like the unjust
[1:53:47] judge amen and the and that and that
[1:53:49] widow woman you got to knock and then
[1:53:53] you got to knock some more and you got
[1:53:55] to knock some more and you got to have a
[1:53:58] determination you got to have a press
[1:54:01] about you you got you got to have a
[1:54:02] desperation amen you got to have a
[1:54:04] confidence in the love of God that he's
[1:54:06] not going to turn you away you got to
[1:54:08] say Lord I'm on your hands Jesus I'm on
[1:54:13] your hands the devil tries to turn you
[1:54:16] back but I'm on God's hands he tries to
[1:54:18] say oh you know it ain't going to happen
[1:54:20] I'm on God's hands he tries to get you
[1:54:23] to go oh this report and that report but
[1:54:26] God I'm on your
[1:54:29] hands
[1:54:33] huah let me just the prophet of God read
[1:54:37] Hebrews 3 And1 that he's the high priest
[1:54:40] of our
[1:54:41] confession he says I'm not saved tonight
[1:54:43] because I get happy and Shout that's
[1:54:45] that isn't it I'm not saved because the
[1:54:47] gift of God works through me I'm saved
[1:54:49] because I have met the conditions that
[1:54:52] Jesus required from me I'm saved
[1:54:55] according to the Bible and not because I
[1:54:57] feel like I'm saved Satan can whip you
[1:54:59] around the stump on your feelings but he
[1:55:01] can't when it's thus sayith the Lord he
[1:55:04] can't wait across that that'll defeat
[1:55:06] him now when you now now when you
[1:55:09] believe you were saved sitting out in
[1:55:11] your in your in your seat out in the
[1:55:13] wherever you was you accepted and begin
[1:55:15] to confess and tell people you were
[1:55:17] saved well you kept on saying I'm saved
[1:55:20] the people said they ain't no difference
[1:55:21] in you but you believe there was and you
[1:55:24] kept with your confession and after a
[1:55:26] while it worked righteousness all your
[1:55:28] neighbors and everybody knows you're
[1:55:29] saved now because you believed it you
[1:55:32] confessed it what happened what changed
[1:55:34] you he's the high priest of your
[1:55:35] confession sitting at the right hand of
[1:55:37] the father making good what you're
[1:55:39] confessing now that's the same thing it
[1:55:41] is by healing you accept him as your
[1:55:44] healer renounce your feelings it's not
[1:55:47] by feelings it's by faith say you're
[1:55:49] healed believe you're healed act like
[1:55:51] you're healed associate with those who
[1:55:53] believe in healing and God will bring
[1:55:55] you right out to a perfect soundness of
[1:55:58] health will not fail you know what that
[1:56:02] what what that is material for it's a
[1:56:04] sword all right to whack the devil with
[1:56:08] this it's a sword it's the word of God
[1:56:11] that he's put in your heart and in your
[1:56:14] mouth to defeat the Devil with we have
[1:56:16] to confess it first before he can be a
[1:56:19] high priest cuz he only intercedes to
[1:56:22] our confession is that right Minister
[1:56:25] Brethren he only intercedes Upon Our
[1:56:27] confession what we confess what he is
[1:56:29] what he has done for us not what he will
[1:56:32] do he has already done it we have to
[1:56:37] confess that he's done it he was wounded
[1:56:41] for our transgressions and with his
[1:56:43] stripes we were healed amen now can I go
[1:56:47] just a little bit further are you sure I
[1:56:50] you sure abely
[1:56:53] you see
[1:56:55] confession is to say the same thing as
[1:56:58] isn't that right but the random would
[1:57:00] show us that a stone is a
[1:57:03] confession he would ask his disciples
[1:57:06] who do men say that I the son of man am
[1:57:08] and Peter would say thou art the Christ
[1:57:11] and then Peter would say Upon This Rock
[1:57:14] this uh uh he would tell Peter Upon This
[1:57:17] Rock I'll build my church and it was not
[1:57:21] Peter but it was the confession of who
[1:57:24] Christ is the revelation of who Christ
[1:57:27] is is the rock that he's going to build
[1:57:31] his church upon now the prophet of God
[1:57:33] would say what good is a confession
[1:57:35] without a stonemason to shape that
[1:57:38] confession amen you see what good is a
[1:57:41] stone if there isn't a stonemason there
[1:57:44] to shape him into a Son of God Amen you
[1:57:49] you you see what good is a confession if
[1:57:51] you don't have a stone Mason which is
[1:57:54] the
[1:57:55] prophet a stone Mason to take the word
[1:58:00] and shape your confession to what he
[1:58:05] says praise the Lord you see if you if
[1:58:08] if you're a stone Mason our brother
[1:58:09] works with stone and and but what good
[1:58:12] is Stone if you just got it in a pile
[1:58:16] and you and you look at those Stone and
[1:58:17] our brother looks and says yep there's
[1:58:19] potential there but it just stays as as
[1:58:20] a pile yeah but you see it's someone I
[1:58:24] would look at that pile and say well I
[1:58:26] it ain't going to do me no good but you
[1:58:27] see our brother can look at that and and
[1:58:29] have a vision and say I can make that
[1:58:32] stone fit this way and I can make that
[1:58:34] stone fit this way and I can do it this
[1:58:36] and Chip and here and do all these
[1:58:37] things and you see it that's what God
[1:58:41] through his word is doing is shaping our
[1:58:44] confession to say the same thing that
[1:58:48] God has already Vindicated in this hour
[1:58:50] tell me where in in the in this message
[1:58:53] where he said you're Defeated come on
[1:58:55] tell me one place in this message that
[1:58:58] he says that we are to have a defeated
[1:59:01] mentality tell me in this word in this
[1:59:04] message that we believe that we are to
[1:59:06] have our heads hanging down low and our
[1:59:08] shoulder stumped and barely getting by
[1:59:10] and wondering if we're going to ever
[1:59:11] make it and is God going to fail us and
[1:59:13] where's the money going to come from and
[1:59:15] the economy here and economy there and
[1:59:17] the world's falling apart we know all of
[1:59:19] those things but the prophet never
[1:59:21] brought us to that he brought us to a
[1:59:23] perfect revelation of who he is and who
[1:59:26] we are in this
[1:59:28] [Applause]
[1:59:30] word you see you're just he's got to
[1:59:32] shape us into sons of God you're just
[1:59:35] piling up a bunch of rocks isn't that
[1:59:37] right it's it it isn't doing a bit of
[1:59:39] good the water wearth away the stone
[1:59:41] that's right that's the people what good
[1:59:43] is Stones if you haven't got a true
[1:59:44] stonemason with a good sharp tool to
[1:59:46] shape him into The Fitting Place in the
[1:59:49] house of God you see the prophet of God
[1:59:53] would go on and say that's end time
[1:59:55] evangelism taking the stones and shaping
[1:59:58] them what good would the stones be if
[2:00:00] you just pile them up and and you see
[2:00:03] there was some there was some uh
[2:00:05] fanaticals one time amen and they
[2:00:08] recognized Messiah was in their midst
[2:00:10] they recognized that who Jesus was when
[2:00:12] he was riding on that donkey and they
[2:00:14] begin to cry who Hosanna Hosanna to the
[2:00:17] highest and and and begin to praise His
[2:00:20] name and and and in that in that system
[2:00:25] that system they they hated Christ amen
[2:00:28] they couldn't recognize who he really
[2:00:30] was amen they they couldn't identify
[2:00:33] that he was the word in the beginning
[2:00:35] was the word and the Word was made flesh
[2:00:37] and dwelt Among Us they couldn't
[2:00:39] understand the redeeming work of the
[2:00:41] Lamb amen so they just he just sent
[2:00:44] things said to the disciples you know uh
[2:00:47] uh uh make them be quiet make them be
[2:00:50] silent amen they're they're bothering us
[2:00:53] but you see Jesus said if they hold
[2:00:56] their peace the stones would immediately
[2:00:59] cry out you see I I think that he was
[2:01:02] probably looking at a pile of ston
[2:01:04] scattered all around there but you see
[2:01:06] it was more than just rocks but he'll
[2:01:09] raise up True
[2:01:11] Confessions he'll raise up true sons of
[2:01:15] God that are that are identified with
[2:01:18] Christ the word that will confess Christ
[2:01:20] the word that will defeat Satan by the
[2:01:24] power and authority of the word God will
[2:01:27] raise these Stones up hallelujah look
[2:01:30] what he said to Peter or to when John
[2:01:33] dealing with those that same system they
[2:01:36] say well Abraham is our father and Abra
[2:01:39] and and John said don't think that
[2:01:41] Abraham is your father don't say that
[2:01:44] for God is able of these stones to raise
[2:01:47] up children to Abraham you see the
[2:01:51] prophet of God said Christ set me to
[2:01:52] build
[2:01:53] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[2:01:56] Christ that they might be the PowerHouse
[2:01:59] and the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[2:02:02] his word the prophet of God again and it
[2:02:06] would say 1 Corinthians 4:20 the kingdom
[2:02:09] of God is his word made Power if you
[2:02:12] want to put that down 1 Corinthians 4:20
[2:02:14] the kingdom of God is God's word may
[2:02:16] power what is the kingdom of God is
[2:02:18] within you the Kingdom's in you and when
[2:02:21] the word comes in there what does this
[2:02:23] word begin it turns itself into Power
[2:02:26] making it say just exactly what it said
[2:02:28] you can't say it says this and it says
[2:02:31] this and make it work in other words the
[2:02:33] word says this and then but you're
[2:02:35] saying it says something different it
[2:02:37] won't work that way but you've got to
[2:02:39] say exactly what that word says you see
[2:02:43] you've got to say the same thing it says
[2:02:47] that makes a confession not saying well
[2:02:50] it's polished up a little here I'll have
[2:02:52] more wisdom I'll be in better standing
[2:02:54] over here you stay with the word there
[2:02:58] it is and it makes it power amen you see
[2:03:03] that's a true confession and that's what
[2:03:06] God has predestinated the bride in the
[2:03:08] last day is is proving to Satan that we
[2:03:12] are not going to get away we're not
[2:03:15] going to deviate from that word not one
[2:03:18] one iota amen but we are going took the
[2:03:22] word in US corrects the error the the
[2:03:26] error that was in the Garden of Eden
[2:03:28] where Eve disbelieved one word but the
[2:03:31] bride of Christ believes he's the same
[2:03:34] yesterday today and forever where is the
[2:03:37] correction the correction is in our
[2:03:40] confession the correction is the word
[2:03:43] made flesh and it's now being confessed
[2:03:46] through human
[2:03:48] lips you see it's the word age and we've
[2:03:51] grown to maturity how many believe that
[2:03:54] it's the season that we're living in
[2:03:56] we're living in the Harvest Time and and
[2:03:58] we are spending every waking moment of
[2:04:00] the heat of his sunlight this vindictive
[2:04:04] message the Vindicated word knowing what
[2:04:06] is what is it doing it's it's it's it's
[2:04:09] shaping it has the power to ripen our
[2:04:15] confession you see the bride will be the
[2:04:18] final voice under her messenger she'll
[2:04:21] be the final a voice to the final age
[2:04:23] not deviating but just staying right
[2:04:25] with it so what is the message of the
[2:04:27] hour doing the word is is maturing or
[2:04:33] ripening our confession no wonder the
[2:04:36] prophet of God says that a Christian
[2:04:38] will never have a negative
[2:04:42] confession now this flesh has plenty of
[2:04:46] it but that Soul where that
[2:04:49] word is ripened
[2:04:52] that that that word we know it's a fight
[2:04:56] if we're going to reign in this flesh
[2:04:58] it's going to be a
[2:05:00] fight if we're going to if we're going
[2:05:02] to reign supreme over this flesh and
[2:05:04] over this mind we have got to take the
[2:05:06] mind of Christ the word of God and bring
[2:05:09] this under
[2:05:10] subjection this under subjection it's a
[2:05:13] battle but we fight to
[2:05:17] rain Hallelujah I I'm closing amen
[2:05:23] you see uh a baby doesn't know how to
[2:05:26] talk I when it's
[2:05:28] born I don't I don't think there's ever
[2:05:31] been a
[2:05:33] expectation that when a your baby is
[2:05:35] born I've had I've had five of them my
[2:05:37] wife
[2:05:39] has we've had five children and there's
[2:05:42] never been an
[2:05:44] expectation I don't care which one I
[2:05:47] don't care if it's the oldest all the
[2:05:48] way to the youngest that that baby is
[2:05:50] going to come out talking right and if
[2:05:53] the baby came out talking it scare you
[2:05:56] to
[2:05:59] death you would think oh God we're in
[2:06:04] trouble but you see you see you begin to
[2:06:08] take that child and and because we're
[2:06:12] here in in in the South and we're here
[2:06:14] in English or we speak English then we
[2:06:18] teach that child and Mom and Dad's you
[2:06:20] know arguing a little bit it's a
[2:06:22] challenge who can get that baby to say
[2:06:25] mama or daddy first and you're and
[2:06:27] you're just continually you don't do it
[2:06:30] immediately no you're still changing
[2:06:32] diapers you're watching the progress
[2:06:35] they're still crying and you know and
[2:06:38] going through the whole process but then
[2:06:40] after a while you're you're you're
[2:06:42] realizing that potential starting to
[2:06:44] come out and you begin to they're trying
[2:06:47] to form words or say something or and
[2:06:49] you and you begin to say mama
[2:06:52] yeah dad say mama say Dad the child's
[2:06:56] looking between
[2:06:59] you and then if you're like my wife my
[2:07:02] wife hears this mama now don't you even
[2:07:06] go there that was not
[2:07:11] mama
[2:07:12] that's I may not be a rocker scientist
[2:07:15] but you you can't pull that one over on
[2:07:18] me and then after a while they say mama
[2:07:22] and then after a while you're teaching
[2:07:23] them this is this is an apple say apple
[2:07:27] right and then they stumble around and
[2:07:29] they say apple and then hot oh
[2:07:33] hot because they're mimicking everything
[2:07:35] you're doing you say hot and they go
[2:07:39] hot you say hurt they say
[2:07:43] hurt and then and and and you're
[2:07:46] training them right with your dilet you
[2:07:47] never have to worry that that boy is
[2:07:50] going to sound like the English and you
[2:07:52] can't understand a licky
[2:07:55] saying don't have to worry about it you
[2:07:57] don't even have to worry about that
[2:07:59] they're going to have Northern dialect
[2:08:01] cuz they're in the South and you're
[2:08:04] proud of
[2:08:07] it and they begin to you know and they
[2:08:10] say y'all and bless your heart as if
[2:08:13] they're
[2:08:14] Pros right oh yeah you see you're
[2:08:19] teaching them what are they doing it's a
[2:08:22] confession right you are teaching them
[2:08:25] as they're growing into into maturity
[2:08:29] yeah the vocabulary just keeps maturing
[2:08:32] with
[2:08:34] them you see I their speech their
[2:08:38] understanding their their thinking
[2:08:42] changes as they grow into
[2:08:45] maturity you know when I went into
[2:08:47] overseas one of the first things that I
[2:08:49] went on my overseas trips
[2:08:52] it it baffled me because I think it was
[2:08:54] Ukraine and and I'm I'm hearing them
[2:08:57] speak in their
[2:08:58] dialect can't understand anything
[2:09:00] they're
[2:09:01] saying and all the sudden I hear English
[2:09:05] but it ain't just English it it it has a
[2:09:09] hillbilly slang to
[2:09:11] it and I'm thinking what in the world I
[2:09:15] turn around and here's a young person
[2:09:18] who has has come and learned English by
[2:09:22] how listening to the
[2:09:25] tapes they taught themselves English by
[2:09:29] taking a prophet's message and applying
[2:09:33] it and they sounded like him they said
[2:09:37] it the way he said it if he said it
[2:09:39] wrong they said it
[2:09:43] wrong
[2:09:45] Hallelujah and I tell you friends we
[2:09:48] have not learned Kentucky we have
[2:09:51] thus sayith the
[2:09:54] Lord we have learned how to speak this
[2:09:57] word over mountains and over over
[2:10:01] circumstances and and over demon
[2:10:04] oppressions and and fears and
[2:10:06] nervousness and anxieties and and and we
[2:10:10] have learned the vocabulary that we that
[2:10:13] Satan is
[2:10:17] defeated and you're not going to be
[2:10:19] healed you are already
[2:10:24] heal your confession brings this body
[2:10:29] sub to your
[2:10:32] confession you see we've returned back
[2:10:35] to a pure language the prophet of God
[2:10:38] let the musicians come the prophet of
[2:10:41] God would say makes this Kingdom of the
[2:10:44] devil crumble and fall turn them big
[2:10:46] blast words on thus sayeth the Lord that
[2:10:49] Atomic word of God flies out there and
[2:10:51] just disintegrate Satan's
[2:10:55] kingdom can you listen to one more
[2:11:00] quote you see the prophet of God how how
[2:11:05] how many believes what Paul says we've
[2:11:06] got to Die
[2:11:09] daily yeah every
[2:11:11] day the prophet of God would say you've
[2:11:14] got to get with the
[2:11:16] word get yourself killed
[2:11:19] out I'm persuaded that many of us
[2:11:22] friends have received the Holy Ghost but
[2:11:23] we just receive enough holy ghost in us
[2:11:25] to make us to a place where we don't
[2:11:28] want to lie we don't want to steal we
[2:11:29] don't want to do anything but what but
[2:11:32] God wants to feel every fiber of his
[2:11:34] church he wants to feel your thinking
[2:11:38] and he wants to feel your mind he wants
[2:11:41] to feel every bit of you just make you
[2:11:43] completely totally dead to yourself or
[2:11:45] to your thinking just so surrendered in
[2:11:48] God till his words just living right
[2:11:50] through you you don't know nothing else
[2:11:52] but God's word just stay right with his
[2:11:56] word it is
[2:11:59] life did you catch it stay right with
[2:12:03] his word it is
[2:12:06] life you see this is not mind over
[2:12:09] matter
[2:12:11] amen this is not mind over matter tries
[2:12:14] to tell you that well how you overcome
[2:12:17] your symptoms or you you overcome your
[2:12:20] sickness is just ignoring it and saying
[2:12:23] you don't have
[2:12:25] it but just simply saying oh it's not
[2:12:28] there you see that's that's why the
[2:12:31] prophet of God says we are not Christian
[2:12:33] Science Christian Science is mind over
[2:12:35] matter and they tried to deaden the Pain
[2:12:38] by getting your mind to not accept it
[2:12:42] getting your mind conditioned to a place
[2:12:45] that you can just go through life and
[2:12:46] say I don't have it I don't have it
[2:12:49] that's not the confession we're talking
[2:12:50] about
[2:12:52] you see the prophet of God would
[2:12:53] actually deal with this I I I I didn't
[2:12:56] know exactly how I believe he was
[2:12:58] dealing with this Christian Science and
[2:13:00] mind over matter and how can we
[2:13:02] overcome he says now you can't say it's
[2:13:05] not a real
[2:13:07] devil he says because he is a real devil
[2:13:11] he's a real person he says you can't say
[2:13:14] that you don't have cancer you do have
[2:13:17] cancer you can't say well I don't have
[2:13:20] these symptoms and I really am I no I'm
[2:13:23] no he says no first you got to recognize
[2:13:26] it's a real devil yeah you are facing
[2:13:32] challenges but he says but you've got to
[2:13:36] realize you've got to
[2:13:39] recognize that Jesus Christ has already
[2:13:42] defeated the Devil he's already
[2:13:46] conquered and greater is he that is in
[2:13:48] you than he that's in the world
[2:13:52] so we're not just simply trying to
[2:13:54] ignore it but we believe that the word
[2:13:57] is not just coming into our mind to give
[2:13:59] us good good Positive Vibes that's not
[2:14:03] what we're looking at we are looking at
[2:14:05] the word has
[2:14:07] life and when you receive the word by
[2:14:10] free moral agency you accept the word
[2:14:13] and it's coming to the channel of your
[2:14:14] mind then that word begins to come down
[2:14:17] into your soul and it begins to clear
[2:14:19] out all the channels the channel of
[2:14:22] reason the channnel of imagination the
[2:14:23] channel of conscience the channel of
[2:14:25] what you feel and see and hear all of
[2:14:28] these senses becoming subject to the
[2:14:31] word because the word is not
[2:14:33] intellectual Faith the word is
[2:14:36] [Music]
[2:14:37] life amen and when that word sets upon
[2:14:41] the throne of your heart then the Bible
[2:14:43] says out of the abundance of the
[2:14:47] heart the mouth speaketh I just told you
[2:14:50] we are are in we are we we are we
[2:14:53] believe we are in the age of harvest
[2:14:57] right out of the abundance that
[2:15:00] abundance is meaning s
[2:15:03] Surplus super
[2:15:06] abundance abundance that was left over
[2:15:10] and above when I read that I thought Oh
[2:15:12] Glory to God we don't just have a little
[2:15:15] bit of Baptist a little bit of Luther a
[2:15:18] little bit of Pentecost
[2:15:21] we have received a full
[2:15:23] crop the Eternal Word is dwelling within
[2:15:27] your heart and it's so we are so full of
[2:15:30] the word it's just pouring out it's
[2:15:33] abundant it's just it's just we're
[2:15:34] drinking out of our saucer so to speak
[2:15:37] it's just a bumper crop it's just
[2:15:39] flowing out where is it flowing out of
[2:15:41] out of the abundance of the heart the
[2:15:44] mouth is
[2:15:45] confessing we've got so much word in us
[2:15:49] so much healing in us so much
[2:15:51] Deliverance in us so much holy ghost in
[2:15:53] us it's coming out of us I am healed I
[2:15:56] am delivered I am an overcomer I am
[2:16:00] victorious I claim my children I claim
[2:16:03] my family I apply the token over my home
[2:16:06] you're it's just coming out it's it's
[2:16:08] something that is just P being pushed
[2:16:10] out of your heart you can help it
[2:16:14] hallelujah it's because the word has
[2:16:15] become life we pray it's helped in some
[2:16:19] way
[2:16:22] you see it's something that's
[2:16:26] transforming it's something that we we
[2:16:29] we are not
[2:16:31] being conformed to the world but we are
[2:16:33] being transformed by the renewing of our
[2:16:36] mind we have received his mind what is
[2:16:40] his word it's his
[2:16:42] Minden and what is that word
[2:16:45] doing for those who have the Holy Ghost
[2:16:48] the word is the transforming power to
[2:16:50] mold you into a Son of
[2:16:54] God but not just a Son of God to say oh
[2:16:57] yeah I'm a Christian oh yeah no an
[2:16:59] adopted son of God a mature Son of
[2:17:04] God the prophet of God would I I just
[2:17:07] listening to this and why Christ says I
[2:17:09] I hope it's all right to say this but
[2:17:11] the prophet of God says we need a real
[2:17:17] repentance you see are we looking at
[2:17:19] that mountain and
[2:17:23] we've come to the age to
[2:17:25] speak we've come to the age that we've
[2:17:28] got to have confidence in the word we've
[2:17:31] got to have we've come to the age of
[2:17:33] maturity that we are passionate about
[2:17:36] that word where else can we go for thou
[2:17:38] Hast the words of eternal life then are
[2:17:41] we running from the Red Sea are we are
[2:17:43] we doubting or purpose are we doubting
[2:17:45] our commission because the prophet of
[2:17:47] God says I need a Revival I was just
[2:17:51] listening to this said I I I need a
[2:17:55] repentance I thought oh God because this
[2:17:57] is the age if there is an ever a
[2:18:01] time that repentance is activated in our
[2:18:05] life
[2:18:07] daily
[2:18:09] daily are we giving in to this feeling
[2:18:11] are we giving in to this emotion are we
[2:18:13] giving in to this reasoning are are we
[2:18:16] thinking something that we're not
[2:18:17] supposed to be thinking are you are
[2:18:18] y'all following me
[2:18:21] when when we entertain
[2:18:23] things and then if you're not careful
[2:18:26] you begin to confess
[2:18:28] it that is not God's will for our
[2:18:33] [Music]
[2:18:34] lives but oh God let us cast down
[2:18:38] reasoning cast down feelings cast down
[2:18:42] those things that are always trying to
[2:18:44] rise above the rise above the power of
[2:18:48] God Amen Die daily so the word can have
[2:18:52] prividence
[2:18:54] hallelujah
[2:18:56] amen we pray it's helping some way what
