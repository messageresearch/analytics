[42:25] seated
[42:27] I want
[42:30] to minister maybe title it amen my
[42:34] thoughts tonight the
[42:36] doctrine of
[42:39] unbelief and we see here as we have just
[42:45] read and I might go ahead and read what
[42:47] we just read um Deuteronomy 16 And1 but
[42:52] I'm going to read it in the Amplified
[42:54] version and and um and uh sometimes we
[42:59] get lost in the in in in the um the Old
[43:05] King James English and so I'm going to
[43:08] read this back to you and um and maybe
[43:12] it'll uh I because I want you to really
[43:15] catch uh this this great
[43:20] Passover um and the observing of it it
[43:23] says observe the month of abib and
[43:26] celebrate the Passover to the Lord your
[43:28] God for in the month of abib the Lord
[43:30] your God brought you out of Egypt by
[43:32] night you shall sacrifice the Passover
[43:35] Lamb to the Lord your God from the flock
[43:37] of the herd in the place where the Lord
[43:40] chooses to establish his name and his
[43:43] presence you shall not eat leaven bread
[43:46] with it instead for seven days you shall
[43:48] eat the Passover with unleavened bread
[43:52] the bread of Affliction for you left the
[43:55] land of of Egypt in haste do this so
[43:58] that all the days of your life you rem
[44:00] you may remember thoughtfully the day
[44:03] when you came out of the land of Egypt
[44:05] for seven days no leaven shall be seen
[44:08] with you in all of your territory and
[44:11] none of the meat which you've sacrificed
[44:14] the evening of the first day shall
[44:15] remain overnight until morning you're
[44:17] not allowed to sacrifice the Passover a
[44:20] lamb in any other of your cities which
[44:23] the Lord your God is giving you but as
[44:26] the place where the Lord your God
[44:28] chooses to establish his name his
[44:30] presence you shall sacrifice the
[44:33] Passover Lamb in the evening at
[44:35] Sunset and at the time that you came out
[44:39] of Egypt you shall cook and eat it in
[44:41] the place which the Lord your God
[44:43] chooses in the morning you are to return
[44:45] to your tents for six days you shall eat
[44:48] unleavened bread and on the seventh day
[44:50] there shall be a celebration to the Lord
[44:52] your God so that you shall do no work on
[44:56] that day can you say
[44:59] Amen
[45:00] now we see here as we are looking at
[45:06] this Passover that the lamb was to be
[45:11] slain it was the lamb being slain one
[45:16] time and then there was seven days of
[45:19] unleavened bread so the lamb was slain
[45:23] once but then there were seven days
[45:26] of unleavened bread now last Wednesday
[45:29] night we talked about amen the leaven of
[45:34] of the Holy Ghost and and Jesus uh
[45:38] brought that uh out there in in Matthew
[45:42] when he was talking about amen the
[45:45] mustard seed and then he also talked
[45:47] about the leaven and that there the
[45:49] Kingdom of Heaven would have a leaven in
[45:52] that it would be amen not a wild yeast
[45:55] but but it would be an anointing of God
[45:58] within our lives upon the word of God
[46:01] but tonight I want to come back and I
[46:03] want to I want to talk about the leaven
[46:06] of unbelief and and if I can uh uh talk
[46:10] to you this this evening the importance
[46:14] of keeping faith alive within our hearts
[46:19] that the word of God can be rich and
[46:22] real and that every word of God means
[46:25] means something to
[46:27] us you are to eat the unleavened bread
[46:30] with your lamb for seven days now this
[46:33] is talking about the seven Church ages
[46:35] amen each age would have to fight the
[46:38] fight of faith it would have to be amen
[46:41] something that they would have to strive
[46:43] for to keep that Faith alive in their
[46:47] hearts we understand that the that the
[46:51] scripture even was saying that uh at the
[46:55] end of the the uh when the Apostle Paul
[46:59] was fixing to leave he says Grievous
[47:02] wolves are going to come in men's going
[47:05] to rise up among you of your own selves
[47:08] and they're going to bring in damnable
[47:10] heresies even in the
[47:13] church and and I believe it was Amen in
[47:17] the New Testament there where it was it
[47:20] was written contend for the faith I
[47:24] believe it was Jude that was saying
[47:26] contend for the faith that was once
[47:29] delivered to the Saints now now the
[47:31] church had only been together had only
[47:32] been going for 30 years but yet there is
[47:37] there is now a cry saying that we need
[47:40] to contend or go back for so we can
[47:44] understand that leaven is there now we
[47:49] understand leaven is something that man
[47:52] though it is very small it's the yeast
[47:54] and though it's a little bit and and you
[47:57] can put it in the lump of bread and you
[48:00] you you mix it in just a little bit of
[48:03] leavon in the bread can will will make
[48:07] the whole loaf to Amen to rise and to
[48:10] puff up can you say amen amen so I I
[48:14] believe I want to say this here tonight
[48:16] if there is ever anything that we should
[48:19] strive for we should not strive to be
[48:22] better amen to rise up uh uh uh to have
[48:26] a better position in the church better
[48:28] musician or to rise up to have a a
[48:31] better place and you know among the
[48:34] preachers or a better place among the
[48:36] the Saints I believe there should be one
[48:38] desire in our heart and that's to keep a
[48:40] pure word or Pure Heart amen that'll
[48:44] that the word of God can have an effect
[48:47] within amen unbelief is still sin
[48:51] unbelief is still ungodly unbelief will
[48:55] keep you from the blessings of God and
[48:57] it will take you away from God it'll
[49:00] keep you out of the Rapture amen so
[49:03] there is a feast amen now we understand
[49:08] that Christ is our Passover Lamb we
[49:11] understand that the word is what we are
[49:14] eating but you see you cannot have the
[49:17] word mixed with your feelings or mixed
[49:21] with your doubt it's got to be mixed
[49:25] with pure Faith or the word will have no
[49:28] effect within your life amen there 1
[49:31] Corinthians 6 or 5 and 8 it says
[49:34] therefore let us keep the feast talking
[49:37] about this Feast here not with the old
[49:39] leevan neither with the leevan of malice
[49:42] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[49:45] bread of sincerity and Truth can you say
[49:49] Amen so this doctrine of unbelief now
[49:54] now you say amen uh uh what would you
[49:59] why would you call it the doctrine of
[50:02] unbelief is because Jesus was rebuking
[50:06] his disciples one time as they were amen
[50:09] uh uh
[50:11] the they were they were looking among
[50:14] themselves they had forgot to bring uh
[50:17] uh bread and and uh matter of of fact
[50:19] let's just read it there in Matthew 16
[50:22] and5 amen we'll just read the whole
[50:25] thing here we'll we we have a little
[50:26] time here amen it says and when his
[50:28] disciples were come to the other side
[50:30] that's Matthew 6 and uh 16 and5 they had
[50:34] forgotten to take bread and then Jesus
[50:36] said unto them take heed and Beware of
[50:39] the leaven of the Pharisees and the
[50:41] Sadducees and they reason among
[50:43] themselves saying is it because we have
[50:46] taken no bread which when Jesus
[50:48] perceived he said unto them oh you of
[50:50] little faith why reason ye among
[50:53] yourselves because you have no bread do
[50:56] you not yet understand neither remember
[51:00] the Five Loaves of the of the 5,000 and
[51:02] how many baskets ye took up neither the
[51:05] seven loaves of the 4,000 and how many
[51:07] baskets ye took up how is it that you do
[51:10] not understand that I spake it not to
[51:14] you concerning bread but that you should
[51:16] beware of the leaven of the feres and
[51:20] the
[51:21] Sadducees and they
[51:23] understood then understood they how he B
[51:26] them to not Beware of the leaven of
[51:29] bread but of the doctrine of the
[51:32] Pharisees and of the Sadducees can you
[51:35] say Amen so this doctrine of unbelief
[51:40] anything
[51:41] contrary to the word of God Amen is
[51:45] unbelief you can't mix the pure word
[51:47] with any man's teaching you cannot mix
[51:51] this message with your own ideology you
[51:54] have got to ex accept it the way God
[51:57] spoke it you have got to accept it the
[52:00] way the prophet brought it you have got
[52:02] to accept it exactly the way God
[52:06] ordained it for this
[52:09] generation you've got to accept it amen
[52:12] there is no other way that you can that
[52:15] that you are going to be able Amen to
[52:17] come in to
[52:19] this into this Perfection because what
[52:23] you eat is what you become
[52:27] Hallelujah well praise the Lord do you
[52:29] love
[52:31] him amen now my wait just a minute the
[52:35] devil's over here trying to shut my
[52:37] computer off amen it says to force quit
[52:41] applications we're not wanting that
[52:45] Hallelujah all right amen we just pray
[52:48] this computer stays on Amen so the the
[52:51] doctrine of
[52:52] unbelief a little bit of Leaven somebody
[52:56] say a little
[52:58] bit you can believe all but just a
[53:02] little bit of the word of God and it
[53:05] will keep you out of the things of God
[53:09] now a Doctrine is a belief or a set of
[53:14] beliefs that that is held and taught a
[53:18] Doctrine is preached or taught Amen to a
[53:23] congregation by a preacher it can be
[53:25] taught to a wife by a husband it can be
[53:28] taught to our children by mamas and
[53:31] daddies it can be amen but but I want to
[53:34] tell you you you you you don't want to
[53:37] be preaching the
[53:39] doctrine of unbelief I believe that
[53:42] there's a time for us to believe God for
[53:44] the Supernatural and get rid of unbelief
[53:47] it is right now if we are expecting to
[53:50] have a Rapture then we need to get the
[53:52] leaven we need to get the doctrine of
[53:55] the of the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[53:58] that just simply cannot believe what God
[54:02] is doing present tense out of our Lives
[54:06] we have got to be able to see the word
[54:10] and believe the word for everything that
[54:13] we believe everything that we are can
[54:15] you say amen amen now I'm sorry guys
[54:19] amen but there's too many Slants to one
[54:22] prophet's message there's been way too
[54:24] many Slants there are too many Doctrine
[54:26] there are too many churches there are
[54:28] too many amen opinions about this
[54:31] message I don't really think brother
[54:33] brandham brought us a message amen that
[54:35] was really hard to understand I believe
[54:38] brother brandham gave us a message that
[54:40] we can believe and if we'll believe it
[54:42] the way he said it it'll produce exactly
[54:45] what God intended for it to be I believe
[54:48] this message has all authority and has
[54:50] all power and will bring about a Rapture
[54:53] if there is somebody that is willing to
[54:55] stand up against all of the doctrines of
[54:57] the Pharisees and say I believe the word
[55:00] of God I refuse doubt I refuse unbelief
[55:03] I refuse interpretation I'm going to
[55:05] stand upon thus saith the Lord of what
[55:08] this message is all
[55:11] about amen amen there's too many of us
[55:15] there's too many out there there's amen
[55:17] when I came when I came into the message
[55:18] I thought I was the only one around you
[55:20] know we thought we were the only ones me
[55:22] and me and Sean a a a and and we we
[55:26] started amen from uh I mean we knew
[55:30] there was others uh uh you know some
[55:31] others around somebody had given us the
[55:33] adoption series and and so we'd listen
[55:35] to that and and and and and brother
[55:37] Shawn and I we would just sat and cry
[55:40] our wives would cry as we just sat
[55:42] together and listen to the messages and
[55:44] amen we'd pass them back and forth those
[55:46] five tapes and amen it was just
[55:49] something that was so precious to us and
[55:51] so we we we we we found out that
[55:54] Jefferson had a had a tape club and so
[55:57] amen we got on the tape club and they
[55:58] started us from the very last sermon in
[56:01] 1965 and and took us backwards amen and
[56:04] so uh H we just ate it up I we started
[56:07] with leadership and and and just every
[56:09] every month we'd get us a new a new set
[56:11] of tapes and we were eating it and and
[56:14] digesting it and amen and it was
[56:17] beginning to change us but then we found
[56:19] out after a while that amen I I got a
[56:22] phone call from amen from a well-meaning
[56:24] brother a very precious brother here a
[56:27] pastor here in Oklahoma that called me
[56:29] and said brother wend we hear that amen
[56:31] that you're tearing at altars and and
[56:34] and and we also hear that amen that that
[56:37] that you're a little Pentecostal now
[56:39] brother wend you've got to get away from
[56:41] Pentecost amen no altars we don't need
[56:44] we and and the tongues and and that kind
[56:46] of thing brother we're beyond that you
[56:48] don't need that if you're going to be in
[56:49] the message now you're going to and I I
[56:52] I looked at the brother and I said amen
[56:54] if this message is of God then it cannot
[56:58] take away from the Bible it cannot take
[57:01] well praise the Lord amen and I said now
[57:04] I just got through listening amen I I
[57:07] had only I I I I hadn't even got through
[57:09] my first box of tapes yet and I told him
[57:11] I said amen almost every tape or every
[57:14] message I have heard he has given an
[57:16] altar call amen he is calling people to
[57:19] repentance he is calling people to come
[57:22] back to the word of God can you say Amen
[57:24] then before you know it I I had somebody
[57:27] else come over and say now if you don't
[57:29] have the understanding of of the seven
[57:31] Thunders then you're not in the message
[57:33] and and so I I said well my goodness I I
[57:37] I I well I hadn't got that far yet I I'm
[57:40] trying to figure out what the Thunders
[57:42] were and and so I amen I said oh my we
[57:45] want to know what the Thunders are so I
[57:47] they said well you got to go to
[57:49] Pennsylvania so I I I I I went to
[57:51] Pennsylvania to the city of love and and
[57:54] there
[57:55] I I I I met Joseph Coleman and and I met
[57:58] some of these other brothers that were
[58:00] telling me now amen and while they were
[58:02] up there preaching they were saying amen
[58:04] there is none of these churches that
[58:07] call themselves message churches that'll
[58:09] make the Rapture you've got to have this
[58:12] and so amen I I begin to think oh my
[58:16] amen and and then before you know it I
[58:18] met this one and then I met that one and
[58:20] then I met this one and before you know
[58:23] it I found that in the message was the
[58:27] same kind of a mess that I had come out
[58:31] of because when I was in Pentecost amen
[58:34] we love saying that our church was going
[58:37] to make make the Rapture and that church
[58:40] will not make the rapture we love saying
[58:42] that we were more spiritual we love
[58:45] prophesying and we love all of these
[58:48] things and and judging ourselves by one

[1:01:19] life the doctrine of unbelief will keep
[1:01:21] you from a Rapture you can not mix the

[1:01:32] amen so amen you you you if there there
[1:01:36] are so many good well-meaning people
[1:01:39] that have that have been affected by
[1:01:42] ministers amen that are preaching uh
[1:01:46] with a slant to it until the people
[1:01:49] don't know what to believe they don't
[1:01:51] know which way to go can you say Amen
[1:01:54] but I I think that we need to be able to
[1:01:58] hear the message I believe you should be
[1:02:00] able to hear me preach and love and walk
[1:02:02] out of this church with a greater love
[1:02:04] for this message that's right I believe
[1:02:07] you should be able to walk into this
[1:02:09] church service amen and and and have a
[1:02:12] greater desire for more of God Amen I I
[1:02:17] I I I I believe that amen I I don't
[1:02:20] believe that you would amen when you
[1:02:22] listen to a message that you have to go
[1:02:24] and and and try to find somebody else's
[1:02:27] amen I I remember in the Thunders I
[1:02:29] would be asking now amen uh uh so what
[1:02:32] are the Thunders and and and um I I was
[1:02:35] I was visiting the church here in Tulsa
[1:02:38] amen and they had come you know i' had
[1:02:40] them come preach for me and I'd went and
[1:02:41] preached for them and and so and so I I
[1:02:45] I man it was constantly a seven Thunders
[1:02:48] gives faith and so amen the whole church
[1:02:50] would jump up and storm the the the uh
[1:02:54] uh the pull pit and amen that seemed to
[1:02:56] be the secret cold and so amen I you
[1:02:59] know I'd be up there preaching and
[1:03:00] wasn't getting too much accomplished you
[1:03:02] know and amen but then I'd say seven
[1:03:04] Thunders give faith and they jump up
[1:03:06] rushing I thought wow amen where where
[1:03:08] is this found at I have I have got to
[1:03:11] figure out where this is at Hallelujah
[1:03:14] but I you know what you know I what I
[1:03:16] have found I found that there was only
[1:03:19] one and maybe two places where brother
[1:03:21] Brandon had talked about it now now does
[1:03:24] that does that diminish anything no but
[1:03:27] do you want to build out of something
[1:03:30] and build your whole belief system well
[1:03:32] are y'all hearing me and on on one
[1:03:35] little quote that can't line up from the
[1:03:38] book of Genesis to the Book of
[1:03:39] Revelations and it sure didn't their
[1:03:42] interpretation of the Thunders did not
[1:03:44] line up with
[1:03:46] 1947 to
[1:03:48] 1965 so what I found was is I've got to
[1:03:52] rightly divide the word of Truth you say
[1:03:56] huh so now we're dividing what brother
[1:03:58] brandom says no we're dividing what
[1:04:01] people think about what brother brandham
[1:04:05] says I believe what brother brandham
[1:04:07] brought us was pure and
[1:04:12] true but my understanding may not be
[1:04:15] right there where brother brandham is
[1:04:17] and that's where I've got to bring my
[1:04:21] thoughts in line with thus sayth the
[1:04:26] lord well praise the Lord can you say
[1:04:29] Amen now we know the purpose of brother
[1:04:31] brandom brother Bram was to take us back
[1:04:33] to the original amen what was the
[1:04:36] original it's the same gospel that the
[1:04:37] Apostle Paul taught brother Bram brought
[1:04:40] us back to the original gospel he was to
[1:04:43] take us out of the denominationalism he
[1:04:45] was to take us out and away from what
[1:04:47] other people thought of what the Bible
[1:04:48] said what people had taught about what
[1:04:51] the Bible said brother bradam was to
[1:04:53] have the end of the Vindication of the
[1:04:55] pillar of fire the angel of God right
[1:04:58] there the same angel that gave the word
[1:05:01] to the Apostle Paul was the exact same
[1:05:04] angel that was visiting William brandham
[1:05:07] and told William brandham amen this is
[1:05:10] the way it was said at the
[1:05:13] beginning Hallelujah can you say amen
[1:05:17] amen when the when brother Brandon went
[1:05:19] on to the other side you know when he
[1:05:21] was translated to the other side and and
[1:05:25] and as he was over there and and and and
[1:05:28] and he said these are your people and
[1:05:30] and there were millions and millions and
[1:05:32] and he says oh my the these can't be
[1:05:34] brandom they amen we're all vagabonds
[1:05:36] they we we we don't have that many
[1:05:39] people and they said no these are your
[1:05:41] converts amen and and he says well
[1:05:44] where's Jesus he's he's on up a little
[1:05:46] bit further amen he says but one of them
[1:05:49] says now when when when when the
[1:05:51] Resurrection comes amen he says we we
[1:05:54] will all stand as your trophies and we
[1:05:56] will be judged by what you preach a and
[1:05:59] and you're going to have to stand before
[1:06:02] God for what you have preached and
[1:06:04] brother brandham says Oh my he says now
[1:06:06] will the Apostle Paul have to stand
[1:06:08] there too and and they said yes he will
[1:06:11] amen and he says well then I I'm going
[1:06:13] to be okay because I have preached what
[1:06:17] he
[1:06:18] preached and all of the millions all in
[1:06:22] udison said we are standing on that I
[1:06:27] just want to say I'm thankful that God
[1:06:29] sent us a prophet I'm thankful that God
[1:06:32] oh come on Church you could be out there
[1:06:35] with all of those opinions you could be
[1:06:37] out there amen with those uh doctrines
[1:06:39] of unbelief by the Pharisees and the
[1:06:41] Sadducees and and all of the
[1:06:44] denominations but God's given you a pure
[1:06:46] word he's given you a pure truth he's
[1:06:49] given you something to believe that
[1:06:51] that'll that'll anchor you and keep you
[1:06:53] in the time times of of your storms of
[1:06:56] your life if you will stand there and if
[1:06:59] you will allow the word of God to dress
[1:07:02] you then you will be everything that
[1:07:05] God's called you to be can you say Amen
[1:07:08] the scripture says that the bride is
[1:07:11] clothed with the white linen of the word
[1:07:15] of
[1:07:18] God Galatians 1 and6 it says I Marvel
[1:07:21] that you are so soon removed from him
[1:07:24] that ha called you into the grace of
[1:07:25] Christ into another
[1:07:28] gospel which is not another but there be
[1:07:31] some that trouble you and would pervert
[1:07:33] the gospel of Christ but though we or an
[1:07:36] angel from heaven preach any other
[1:07:38] gospel unto you than what we have
[1:07:40] preached unto you let him be
[1:07:43] what as we said before so say I now
[1:07:47] again if any man preach any other gospel
[1:07:50] unto you than what you have received let
[1:07:52] him be what
[1:07:55] for but for do I now persuade men or
[1:08:00] God which way am I going to go am I
[1:08:02] going to go after the Pharisees and
[1:08:04] their Doctrine or am I going to stand
[1:08:07] with the angel of God who has given me
[1:08:09] this word can you say amen he says do I
[1:08:12] seek to please men for if I yet please
[1:08:14] men I should not be the servant of
[1:08:15] Christ so I want to say anything
[1:08:18] contrary to the faith in every word of
[1:08:20] God is sin Saints if it is in the Bible
[1:08:25] we are to believe it and embrace it can
[1:08:28] I hear an amen if God says it in that
[1:08:33] Bible we believe
[1:08:35] it and I just want to let you know right
[1:08:38] now the prophet did not take anything
[1:08:41] out of the Bible the prophet brought us
[1:08:44] back to the
[1:08:49] Bible so there are some that says you
[1:08:51] don't need your Bible anymore all you
[1:08:52] need to do
[1:08:54] it's just amen just just what what did
[1:08:56] Brother brandham say no you've got to
[1:08:58] have a basis for what you believe I am
[1:09:01] not believing this cuz William brandham
[1:09:04] said it I am believing it because he
[1:09:07] took us back to the
[1:09:12] Bible therefore because he is a word
[1:09:17] Prophet I can believe his
[1:09:20] teachings Hallelujah What can you sayen
[1:09:23] amen amen now now Beware of the 11 of
[1:09:28] the Pharisees beware beware now now

[1:09:39] right there and says
[1:09:41] hey
[1:09:43] beware I see some leaven in your hearts
[1:09:46] and they're going huh what he says yeah
[1:09:50] yeah he says after I've done the
[1:09:52] Miracles of the Fish and Loaves here and
[1:09:56] I've done this and I fed here and you're
[1:10:00] questioning and asking what are we going
[1:10:03] to do he
[1:10:07] says there's some leaven of
[1:10:11] unbelief and if you're not careful and
[1:10:14] you don't get the leav of unbelief out
[1:10:17] Hallelujah these guys ain't going out
[1:10:19] drinking these guys ain't going out
[1:10:20] carousing these guys are simply looking
[1:10:22] there at a situ sitation that was
[1:10:24] impossible and instead of believing God
[1:10:26] for the supernatural right there in
[1:10:29] their midst
[1:10:32] Hallelujah and Jesus is telling them
[1:10:34] amen you need to Beware of the doctrine
[1:10:38] amen the unbelief can you sayen amen I
[1:10:41] want to say here tonight I think that
[1:10:43] there should be a a a a a a a real amen
[1:10:48] a real eagles's eye on any devil that
[1:10:53] will keep keep Faith from percolating
[1:10:55] the word of God in our lives I I I think
[1:10:59] that we need to we need to zero in well
[1:11:02] praise the Lord amen I think if Israel
[1:11:05] would have been a little bit more amen
[1:11:07] apt to what watch The Border I if Israel
[1:11:10] would have been a little bit more in
[1:11:12] tune amen instead of getting so LAX the
[1:11:15] day amen you know last Saturday uh you
[1:11:19] know when they come in from this way and
[1:11:21] that way they wouldn't have have all the
[1:11:24] hostages and they wouldn't have all of
[1:11:26] the things that are people are killed
[1:11:28] over there right now but the enemy came
[1:11:30] in because they weren't guarding the
[1:11:32] Border they they they they got lack if
[1:11:35] you will amen but I'm telling you the
[1:11:38] devil is looking for a way
[1:11:43] in Praise the Lord amen they're all
[1:11:47] sitting around say we don't know how it
[1:11:48] happened we don't know what it happened
[1:11:50] it was a concerted effort amen hit us
[1:11:52] all at once they came in from the skies
[1:11:53] came in from the sea came in from uh
[1:11:55] water came in from uh the gland they
[1:11:58] were coming in from every which
[1:11:59] direction and what happened they came in
[1:12:02] and to destroy and to kill and to Ma and
[1:12:06] to take hostages amen but I and I I want
[1:12:10] to tell you in the Church of the Living
[1:12:12] God there's too much laxness among us we
[1:12:15] allow things we're not guarding that
[1:12:17] devil like we should but I want to tell
[1:12:19] you if there's ever a time to guard that
[1:12:22] heart against belief and against the sin
[1:12:26] amen of laxness and lukewarmness we
[1:12:28] should stand with that word and say God
[1:12:31] give me a heart that
[1:12:36] believes
[1:12:38] amen he said now the Apostle Paul or
[1:12:41] Paul was a prophet and taught by the
[1:12:43] Holy Ghost if Paul baptized in the name
[1:12:45] of Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ and said
[1:12:48] anyone that did different from preaching
[1:12:51] from his preaching was a cursed then it
[1:12:53] is time to wake up and see that the
[1:12:55] church is no longer controlled by the
[1:12:56] Holy Ghost but it is controlled by the
[1:12:59] nicians Acts 20 and 27 it says I have
[1:13:02] not shun to declare unto you all the
[1:13:04] counsel of God take heed therefore unto
[1:13:07] yourselves and to all the flock over
[1:13:08] which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:13:10] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:13:13] which he has purchased with his own
[1:13:15] blood for I know that after my departing
[1:13:17] shall Grievious wolves enter in among
[1:13:19] you and not sparing the flock also of
[1:13:22] your own self shall men arise speaking
[1:13:25] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:13:27] after them he said Paul saw it coming
[1:13:31] but he warned them about this subtle
[1:13:33] priesthood that will come and take over
[1:13:36] with its false doctrines he knew that
[1:13:39] they would Implement a way of worship
[1:13:41] that excluded the people from any part
[1:13:44] of a holy ghost Ministry and even right
[1:13:47] today among those who claim to be free
[1:13:49] and full of the spirit there is not too
[1:13:52] much freedom of the leoty amen and the
[1:13:54] best we can see is a few preachers with
[1:13:56] inspired preaching while the flock just
[1:13:59] sits there and tries to absorb it this
[1:14:01] is a far cry from Paul who said that
[1:14:05] when it come when all come together all
[1:14:08] had the leading of the spirit all
[1:14:10] participated in spiritual worship the
[1:14:13] church corporate has never learned this
[1:14:15] lesson from the scripture nor from
[1:14:17] history every time God gives a
[1:14:20] Vindication a visitation of the Holy
[1:14:22] Spirit and people get free after a while
[1:14:25] they bind themselves right back to the
[1:14:27] very thing they came out of are y'all
[1:14:29] hearing me he says when the Luther came
[1:14:31] out of Catholicism people stayed free
[1:14:34] for a while but when he died people
[1:14:36] Simply
[1:14:37] Organized uh what they thought they
[1:14:39] believe and set up their own Creeds and
[1:14:42] ideas and repudiated anyone that said
[1:14:44] anything opposite they went right back
[1:14:47] to Catholicism with a little different
[1:14:50] form now I I I want to tell you tonight
[1:14:53] amen if we are not expecting the
[1:14:56] supernatural God in all of his power and
[1:15:00] all of his Splendor and all of his glory
[1:15:02] in this last Church Amen brother we have
[1:15:06] taken on another form are you hearing me
[1:15:08] it was the Catholic church that left all
[1:15:12] of the spirituality to the preachers it
[1:15:15] was the Catholic church that said only
[1:15:17] the priest amen had What it Took and the
[1:15:20] congregation well we don't need your
[1:15:22] spiritual we don't need your this and we
[1:15:25] don't need your that but I want to tell
[1:15:26] you the Church of the Living God is a
[1:15:30] living
[1:15:31] organism we're not a denomination we are
[1:15:35] an organism where the power of the holy
[1:15:39] spirit is to flow
[1:15:41] through praise the Lord amen now I want
[1:15:46] to I I I I I I won't I I I I want to
[1:15:50] just talk to you for a moment here
[1:15:51] tonight He Man
[1:15:53] to
[1:15:55] misplace anything in God's word would
[1:15:59] simply be to Short Circuit God's power
[1:16:02] in your
[1:16:03] life to
[1:16:06] misplace anything in God's word
[1:16:10] hallelujah amen we had a dog or brother
[1:16:13] sea had a dog when we were kids amen it
[1:16:16] was a big old husky or a malamute and my
[1:16:21] goodness that dog his hair was so thick
[1:16:24] and uh man and and that he was a Houdini
[1:16:27] he could get out of the yard he was
[1:16:28] constantly digging to get out of the
[1:16:30] yard and he man Hallelujah so so Dad Dad
[1:16:35] finally put a fence amen an electric
[1:16:37] fence all around that the backyard down
[1:16:40] low and oh it kept him in for a little
[1:16:42] while and and so every time boy he'd get
[1:16:45] his nose up to it you'd
[1:16:47] hear we're going yes it's working amen
[1:16:50] but after a week or so of it Hallelujah
[1:16:53] we heard
[1:16:54] just hallelujah we're thinking yes and
[1:16:56] then we looked out the front yard and
[1:16:57] there he is on the porch Hallelujah so
[1:17:00] we found out what he done amen he found
[1:17:03] we we watched him put him back in amen
[1:17:05] he kept getting out over and over and
[1:17:07] over and so we We snuck out there and we
[1:17:09] looked and that dude would just lay down
[1:17:11] over on top of that wire ground it out
[1:17:14] to the ground and it would hurt for a
[1:17:15] few for a moment and then he found out
[1:17:18] that it quit shocking him once it hit
[1:17:19] the ground he grounded the wire out and
[1:17:22] then he would crawl underneath the fence
[1:17:24] amen and he's just sitting there just a
[1:17:26] all a Happy H tongue sticking out man
[1:17:29] just just just wanting us to brag on it
[1:17:32] Hallelujah and you know what I I I there
[1:17:34] there's too many Christians that are
[1:17:36] grounding out the power of God in their
[1:17:39] lives amen we're grounding out the power
[1:17:42] of God in our lives and brother brandham
[1:17:44] said this is how you do it he says now
[1:17:46] he says you can't take this your
[1:17:48] sincerity and all that you want to
[1:17:49] confess you just can't take it to the
[1:17:51] Methodist altar to a Baptist altar to a
[1:17:54] Pentecostal altar he says but there is
[1:17:56] an altar somewhere that he has chose to
[1:17:59] put his name in it and he would meet you
[1:18:01] at that place now when you get
[1:18:03] everything running just right it's going
[1:18:06] to run everything's set in order but if
[1:18:09] there is a short in that wire the light
[1:18:11] won't come on because it has been
[1:18:13] grounded and when you'll take one of
[1:18:16] God's word or one of his
[1:18:18] places in your own heart with stive uh
[1:18:21] selfish objectives it'll ground the
[1:18:24] power of God right there well praise the
[1:18:29] Lord you take one of God's word and you
[1:18:33] you misplace it for your own ability for
[1:18:35] your own amen for your own selfish
[1:18:37] motives and objectives well can you say

[1:19:41] spiritual gifts amen my word I was up
[1:19:44] preaching here a while back and somebody
[1:19:45] told me the other day they told me here

[1:20:23] message well praise the Lord I was
[1:20:25] somewhere one time and I was preaching
[1:20:27] on the bride age amen and I was saying
[1:20:29] amen God's called us out of this
[1:20:31] Pentecostal age into a bride age said it
[1:20:33] just like brother bradam said it
[1:20:35] Hallelujah all of a sudden I was pulled
[1:20:37] back in the office and said no no no no
[1:20:39] no we can't preach it like that you're
[1:20:41] preaching that there's there's another
[1:20:43] Revelation or there's another Prophet
[1:20:45] there's an eighth age I said no I still
[1:20:48] believe just like all message Believers
[1:20:52] that there we are living in the leoan
[1:20:56] age but the
[1:20:58] Overcomers of the age have been lifted
[1:21:02] up into the bride
[1:21:05] age does that make eight
[1:21:08] ages same age we're in the leoan age but
[1:21:14] the prophet is saying I no longer call
[1:21:16] you church I call you
[1:21:19] bride pulling us out of the pit
[1:21:22] Pentecostal system into the word age
[1:21:27] bride age bride coming word come on
[1:21:30] brother brandham said it so many
[1:21:32] different
[1:21:34] ways but I can't preach that no
[1:21:37] more in the message
[1:21:41] churches
[1:21:42] because we've got
[1:21:45] doctors of
[1:21:48] messy that is telling us what the
[1:21:51] prophet meant
[1:21:54] okay well praise the
[1:21:56] Lord I I I I I I I I just want to tell
[1:22:00] you
[1:22:01] folks if you ain't preaching every bit
[1:22:04] of this message you ain't preaching
[1:22:11] it oh can you say amen
[1:22:15] amen we don't believe in Preachers my
[1:22:21] foot we don't believe in we don't
[1:22:23] believe in church what what are we what
[1:22:25] are you what what what what what are we
[1:22:26] trying to say what is the world
[1:22:30] thinking they're calling us an a
[1:22:34] cult and they when they're calling us
[1:22:37] now they're not studying the message
[1:22:39] we're doing the
[1:22:41] studying but they think William brandom
[1:22:43] says hauh don't go over there you follow
[1:22:45] me where did William brandham ever say
[1:22:50] throw the Bible away and th and follow
[1:22:52] me
[1:22:53] come on he said follow me as I follow
[1:23:01] Christ no wonder the message has got
[1:23:03] such a bad name and it ain't William
[1:23:06] brandom that made it a bad
[1:23:08] name and I want to tell
[1:23:11] you it ain't the devil's making it a bad
[1:23:13] name it's the Pharisees that's making it
[1:23:15] a bad name it's the Pharisees that's
[1:23:18] preaching pre taking portions of it and
[1:23:21] then throwing in their own
[1:23:23] I say let's get away from the Levan of
[1:23:25] unbelief let's get away from the
[1:23:27] doctrines of unbelief and let's stand
[1:23:30] upon thus saith the Lord and believe it
[1:23:34] with everything we
[1:23:37] haveall why is there so many groups that
[1:23:40] don't believe in a move of
[1:23:43] God why why is there so many groups that
[1:23:47] believe that you've got to come and set
[1:23:48] in a church and it better be called Osco
[1:23:55] or you're not in the
[1:23:57] message where did you get
[1:24:02] that brother Bram
[1:24:05] said when the girl came up to him and
[1:24:07] told him said my goodness where a guy
[1:24:10] came up to him and said man I was doing
[1:24:12] really good until that woman in front of
[1:24:14] me started shouting and screaming man he
[1:24:17] said it gave me chills just it just
[1:24:19] messed everything I couldn't hear
[1:24:21] nothing else you said
[1:24:23] Amen brother Brandon said well that's
[1:24:26] good you're going to make a good message
[1:24:28] believer I'm so stinking proud of you
[1:24:32] you're catching everything I'm
[1:24:34] saying good for you now if the rest of
[1:24:38] those sorry Pentecostals in my church
[1:24:41] would learn to shut
[1:24:43] up no he says what brother you sure
[1:24:48] don't want to go to heaven come on
[1:24:53] huh he says there's going to be shouting
[1:24:56] and screaming and hollering all over the
[1:24:59] place in
[1:25:02] heaven then he told him this is going to
[1:25:04] be the quietest place you ever go up
[1:25:06] there there's going to be shouting and
[1:25:08] praises and down there's going to be
[1:25:10] wailing and nashing of teeth there's
[1:25:13] going to be moaning and groaning there's
[1:25:15] going to come on church I want to tell
[1:25:17] you right now let me praise God while
[1:25:19] I've got the check let the power of God
[1:25:22] be in me while I've got the
[1:25:25] chance well glory be to the Lamb of God
[1:25:29] Amen can you say amen amen it ain't
[1:25:32] brother brandham that done it it ain't
[1:25:34] brother brandom uh uh uh uh that that
[1:25:36] that ground out the power brother
[1:25:38] brandham had the power of God all the
[1:25:40] way up to the time that he left and the
[1:25:42] power of God was in his preaching and
[1:25:44] souls were being saved and admonished
[1:25:46] all
[1:25:48] the well can you say amen amen
[1:25:52] but it's the doctrine of unbelief that
[1:25:56] begins to come in how does this Doctrine
[1:25:58] how how how does a doct a doctrine
[1:26:01] spread how does a doctrine spread
[1:26:03] brother brandham taught us how it was he
[1:26:05] says in the first church age it was a it
[1:26:08] was just a little bit of a it was an
[1:26:10] action it was a little bit of a and then
[1:26:12] he says in the next Church age you
[1:26:14] become a saian and then the next Church
[1:26:16] age he says it become an official
[1:26:19] Doctrine first was just a little bit of
[1:26:22] yeah well you know amen but the devil
[1:26:25] but the devil was still a little bit
[1:26:26] scared because the power of God was
[1:26:28] there but the next Church age they begin
[1:26:30] to talk about it a little bit more
[1:26:31] because the power of God was already
[1:26:33] diminishing and then by the by by the
[1:26:35] time we got down to the Dark Ages Satan
[1:26:38] had already come in amen and it taken
[1:26:40] the very life out of the church I want
[1:26:42] to tell you tonight amen it is the
[1:26:44] taking the life of God out of the church
[1:26:46] is not God doing it it's the devil doing
[1:26:49] it and the way that it is done is
[1:26:51] because it is being preached it is being
[1:26:54] preached when you preach against the
[1:26:55] gifts when you preach against amen
[1:26:57] Miracles when you preach against the
[1:26:59] move of God what are you doing you are
[1:27:01] creating an atmosphere within the heart
[1:27:05] of those that are listening to
[1:27:09] you tell me one place where brother
[1:27:11] brandham ever took the nine spiritual
[1:27:12] gifts out of the church tell me one
[1:27:14] place where brother brandham ever said
[1:27:15] that you're not supposed to be uh we
[1:27:17] don't believe in Preachers anymore or
[1:27:19] that you need to stay home and listen to
[1:27:20] tapes come on
[1:27:24] he did correct all of those Pentecostals
[1:27:26] that were using the gifts in the wrong
[1:27:28] way he was saying there's a lot of them
[1:27:31] that are anointed because they don't
[1:27:32] have enough
[1:27:34] discernment they're anointed of evil
[1:27:36] spirits but he never took it out that's
[1:27:40] right and just because there's some
[1:27:42] rotten preachers Hallelujah doesn't mean
[1:27:45] that everyone's
[1:27:51] rotten
[1:27:53] some people say well it's easy for you
[1:27:54] to say because you're a preacher listen
[1:27:56] I've had my share I've had my share I've
[1:27:59] been wounded I've been hurt I've been
[1:28:02] kicked while on the ground by preachers
[1:28:05] I have been scarred by preachers and if
[1:28:08] it wasn't for the grace of God in my
[1:28:11] life I wouldn't be standing up here
[1:28:12] tonight but it was God's grace it was go
[1:28:15] come on Church we've all been scarred by
[1:28:18] one another and just because we hurt one
[1:28:21] another does not mean God is not using
[1:28:28] preachers well praise the Lord if you're
[1:28:31] going to use that if you're going to use
[1:28:32] that philosophy then every one of you
[1:28:35] need to break up and
[1:28:40] divorce well praise the
[1:28:42] Lord because mama ain't always been good
[1:28:45] to you and Daddy hasn't always well
[1:28:48] praise the Lord there's been times where
[1:28:51] the husband is said something to wife
[1:28:52] and the wife has said something to Mama
[1:28:54] woo Hallelujah but you know what amen
[1:28:57] does that mean that God doesn't work in
[1:28:59] marriages anymore does that mean that
[1:29:01] we're not supposed to commit to one
[1:29:02] another anymore no that means you need
[1:29:04] to both get prayed through that you're
[1:29:06] both humans and did it under the blood
[1:29:09] and walk in line with the word and God
[1:29:12] will bless the
[1:29:17] marriage well praise the Lord daddy's
[1:29:20] bad to me been been bad so I've been
[1:29:22] hurt by dad so I don't believe in dads
[1:29:30] anymore well praise the
[1:29:33] lord we don't need no preachers so we're
[1:29:36] going to skip what God says about the
[1:29:38] five-fold ministry we're going to skip
[1:29:39] what the Bible says and we're going to
[1:29:41] skip what brother Brenham says and we're
[1:29:44] going to do our own thing stay home and
[1:29:45] we're going to listen to tapes because
[1:29:47] coming out of the pure lips of the very
[1:29:49] mouth of God hallelujah if if you were
[1:29:52] listening to the very mouth of God you'd
[1:29:54] be going to church cuz that's what the
[1:29:56] that's what came out of the
[1:29:58] [Applause]
[1:30:01] lips if if you were Hallelujah push play
[1:30:06] push push play and Obey that's what I
[1:30:13] do now I put a challenge out to all the
[1:30:16] message Believers push play to every
[1:30:20] word that was brought to this generation
[1:30:24] and Obey
[1:30:27] [Applause]
[1:30:28] it but we take the power I know there's
[1:30:33] a lot of out there that's that's going
[1:30:35] in there I can't follow
[1:30:37] them I can't follow any of
[1:30:39] them but I can follow the prophet and I
[1:30:43] can ask God as a pastor to give me a
[1:30:46] pure heart before him to lead the people
[1:30:50] to help the people come on
[1:30:53] now am I subject to mistakes dear God
[1:30:57] yes have I had to stand up here and tell
[1:30:59] the church before that I'm wrong dear
[1:31:02] God
[1:31:07] yes but we're all
[1:31:09] striving and we're all pushing well
[1:31:12] praise the
[1:31:13] Lord hallelujah I'm I I I I hope I
[1:31:16] haven't already stepped on any pet
[1:31:18] doctrines here you guys are here so you
[1:31:20] got to believe in church amen
[1:31:27] that's
[1:31:28] right to say we don't believe in
[1:31:32] church is to go directly against the
[1:31:35] word of
[1:31:37] God brother bradam said amen and I've
[1:31:41] got a lot of quotes coming in all at
[1:31:42] once here but brother bradam says if
[1:31:44] you've got the Holy Ghost you cannot
[1:31:47] wait for those doors to
[1:31:50] open
[1:31:53] amen
[1:31:54] amen amen that's exactly right now now
[1:32:00] brother brandham would
[1:32:03] talk he would say now when he's talking
[1:32:05] about Martin Luther King's position as a
[1:32:10] minister and he's saying that he's not a
[1:32:12] politician that he's supposed to be a
[1:32:15] carrier of the words of life and he's
[1:32:18] asking the question what business does a
[1:32:20] preacher have out there trying to write
[1:32:24] social
[1:32:27] wrongs you said a preacher has no
[1:32:29] business doing
[1:32:30] that H H he he h how are you going to
[1:32:33] get hate out of a
[1:32:36] person who hates a black
[1:32:40] man outside of a
[1:32:42] unregenerate outside of a regeneration
[1:32:45] of the Holy Ghost you can't mix it can
[1:32:48] you say Amen now he says as I said
[1:32:53] Sunday Martin Luther King down there
[1:32:56] with them precious people leading them
[1:32:58] into a death trap oh if somebody could
[1:33:01] only talk to that man I wish I could
[1:33:03] just for a little uprising of the school
[1:33:05] proposition and and what a what a
[1:33:08] difference now or it's a it's it's it's
[1:33:10] a lot of difference my goodness if the
[1:33:13] people ain't got hard enough to
[1:33:14] associate with a man because of his
[1:33:16] color they're condemned and dead
[1:33:20] anyhow
[1:33:22] he says now he says don't fight against
[1:33:25] it what if somebody said all the Irish
[1:33:28] or somebody all the German or somebody
[1:33:30] else had a a disassociation that that
[1:33:33] would that that that would never bother
[1:33:35] Christians they'd move right
[1:33:37] on and that man's a Christian as a
[1:33:41] minister he shouldn't be leading people
[1:33:42] into a revolt against that he's going to
[1:33:46] cause Millions to die it'll start
[1:33:48] another revolutionary it's a shame to do
[1:33:50] that can you say Amen now now now he's
[1:33:52] using this he is actually this is in the
[1:33:57] indictment this is in the indictment so
[1:33:59] he is he is he is talking he is using
[1:34:03] this preacher and saying he's using his
[1:34:06] office
[1:34:09] wrongly instead of pointing them to the
[1:34:11] word are you are yall understanding
[1:34:14] where he's coming from now he says the
[1:34:16] same thing happens right here exactly
[1:34:19] the same thing again that's right the
[1:34:21] people
[1:34:22] how that' only look at the truth and see
[1:34:24] what the truth is well our church don't
[1:34:26] believe that we got some other way well
[1:34:28] it ain't the right way it ain't it ain't
[1:34:31] the thing he said repent be baptized
[1:34:33] every one of you or be baptized in the
[1:34:35] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:34:37] of sins now they won't do it oh oh then
[1:34:40] what uh what did they do amen now that's
[1:34:44] just that's just one thing up on
[1:34:46] hundreds we'll get to maybe as as fast
[1:34:49] as we can it's the second crucifixion
[1:34:52] then if a man accepts Father Son and
[1:34:54] Holy Spirit a Creed instead of the word
[1:34:58] titles instead of the name what does
[1:35:01] what does he do to the people talking
[1:35:03] about the preacher he crucifies the
[1:35:05] effects of the word to the
[1:35:09] people so a preacher standing up going
[1:35:13] against what William brandham has
[1:35:15] already taught
[1:35:17] us is
[1:35:20] crucifying the
[1:35:22] very precious
[1:35:25] power to the
[1:35:27] people because they are putting their
[1:35:32] fisical ideas in instead of letting the
[1:35:36] people believe every
[1:35:43] word how many folks here in Oklahoma
[1:35:46] what's not going to come not going to
[1:35:48] come to church well well Joseph says the
[1:35:50] word Joseph's not our
[1:35:53] Prophet now he is now I don't I I don't
[1:35:56] I'm not going to dispute whether you
[1:35:57] know whatever you know I'm not saying
[1:35:59] he's not a prophet but the word Prophet
[1:36:03] there's only one to an age
[1:36:06] folks I ain't it you ain't it and
[1:36:09] Brother Joseph isn't
[1:36:12] it and if I should lead you
[1:36:15] contrary to what the word Prophet
[1:36:18] brought then I am to be a curse that's
[1:36:22] right
[1:36:24] true there's only one message that is
[1:36:26] infallible it's not wendle
[1:36:29] Martins it's not William
[1:36:31] Smith it's not Kobe Martin it's not
[1:36:35] Joseph Branham there's only one
[1:36:38] messenger and it was Malachi the 4th
[1:36:42] chapter the 5th verse I send you Elijah
[1:36:45] and his
[1:36:46] son I send you
[1:36:50] Elijah
[1:36:56] because if we're not careful it's the
[1:36:59] same thing trying to pull us the same
[1:37:03] old devil trying to pull me said you got
[1:37:06] to believe it this way you got to
[1:37:08] believe the two Souls you can you can't
[1:37:10] preach predestination you can't pre you
[1:37:12] can't you can't you can't no no no no if
[1:37:14] anyone wants to say anything contrary to
[1:37:18] what the prophet said you say well I've
[1:37:20] got a quote
[1:37:21] well what about all the rest of them
[1:37:24] line it
[1:37:26] up forsake not the assembling of
[1:37:30] ourselves together even so much the more
[1:37:36] as you see that day
[1:37:44] approaching you see now it's easy for us
[1:37:47] to say h h yeah I'm glad you got away
[1:37:49] from that Thunder oh I'm glad but then
[1:37:51] when it comes to our own pet little
[1:37:53] peeves I am saying it can be
[1:37:58] le if we don't line it up that's right
[1:38:02] with every word of
[1:38:05] God do I fight the Thunder Brothers do I
[1:38:07] fight do I fight Brother Joseph I am not
[1:38:10] one of those guys that believe we ought
[1:38:11] to be fighting one another I believe
[1:38:13] this message is pure and true and the
[1:38:14] words of God will end up coming out the
[1:38:17] winner at the finishing line but I'm
[1:38:19] telling you as my congregation you've
[1:38:21] got to believe every bit of
[1:38:27] it can you say
[1:38:29] amen and he says he's crucified the
[1:38:32] effects of the word to the people and
[1:38:33] when he says that Mark 16 was just for
[1:38:36] that generation and God himself right
[1:38:38] there Jesus talking to them and said go
[1:38:41] you into all the world and preach the
[1:38:42] gospel to Every Creature he that
[1:38:44] believeth and his baptized shall be damn
[1:38:46] and he that believeth not shall not or
[1:38:48] uh shall not be let's see he that
[1:38:50] believeth and his baptized shall be
[1:38:52] saved and he that believeth not shall be
[1:38:53] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:38:55] how far Every Nation every Creed every
[1:38:58] tongue every race every people the same
[1:39:01] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[1:39:03] that believe and when a man tries to cut
[1:39:05] that out of the Bible he crucifies the
[1:39:08] effects of the Gospel to that generation
[1:39:12] to or to that congregation so I indict
[1:39:16] you in the name of Jesus Christ you're
[1:39:19] guilty of murdering the
[1:39:28] Lord you see
[1:39:31] man
[1:39:33] now they asked him that the question and
[1:39:36] answers on the seals would the bride of
[1:39:39] Christ have a Ministry before the
[1:39:42] Rapture he says
[1:39:44] sure that's what's going on right now
[1:39:47] the bride of Christ certainly it is the
[1:39:50] message of the hour hour see the bride
[1:39:52] of Christ she consists of Apostles
[1:39:56] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:40:00] pastors that's the bride of Christ sure
[1:40:03] she's got a Ministry a great ministry
[1:40:07] it's the ministry of the hour it'll
[1:40:11] be so
[1:40:14] humble can you say
[1:40:17] amen he says oh I know there there many
[1:40:21] that rise up and go out and say oh I
[1:40:22] don't need to go to church anymore
[1:40:24] praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's
[1:40:25] the teacher he says when you get that
[1:40:28] idea you're just wrong for why did the
[1:40:30] Holy Ghost set the teachers in the
[1:40:32] church if he was if he was going to be
[1:40:34] the teacher there are first apostles
[1:40:37] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:40:39] pastors the Holy Spirit set the teachers
[1:40:41] in the church so he could teach through
[1:40:44] that teacher it is in according to the
[1:40:46] word of God or if it isn't according to
[1:40:49] the word of God God doesn't conf
[1:40:51] conferment it isn't the right kind of
[1:40:53] teaching it must compare with the entire
[1:40:58] Bible and be just as alive today as it
[1:41:04] was
[1:41:05] then there's the real thing manifest can
[1:41:09] you say Amen in another place he says he
[1:41:12] presents his army in the form of a five
[1:41:15] five offices first apostles prophets
[1:41:18] teachers pastors evangelists that's his
[1:41:21] army that's his soldiers that's his
[1:41:24] commanding officers all with the baptism
[1:41:26] of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to
[1:41:28] meet the enemy on any grounds he comes
[1:41:30] upon to meet the enemy with the word of
[1:41:33] God each one backing one another up with
[1:41:36] a chief Captain not out there in front
[1:41:39] up here above back behind but in them
[1:41:44] that's the Army vindicating vindicating
[1:41:47] what his
[1:41:49] resurrection by the
[1:41:51] proof of his Works can you say
[1:41:56] Amen now if Satan can come in now this
[1:42:00] is just a simple one I and I know we all
[1:42:02] believe
[1:42:04] that but look at how Satan has come
[1:42:09] in and has so pushed it
[1:42:12] out has so
[1:42:15] taken folks from this message so far
[1:42:18] away from the word of God
[1:42:21] till the message don't even resemble the
[1:42:23] word you have to go through some
[1:42:25] brother's
[1:42:27] interpretation The Prophet's message is
[1:42:30] to make the word
[1:42:32] clear not to take
[1:42:36] away I can't take away from the
[1:42:38] prophet's message and the prophet can't
[1:42:41] take away from the word that's why he
[1:42:46] came oh come on Church Hallelujah but
[1:42:51] you see but you see Satan comes in and
[1:42:54] and and and he and he and he and he
[1:42:56] takes you he takes me and before you
[1:42:59] know it because he has sliced a little
[1:43:01] bit out of this and sliced a little bit
[1:43:03] out of that he's taken our armor and
[1:43:06] we're no longer fighting the good fight
[1:43:07] of Faith we're just we're just taking
[1:43:09] whatever we want and letting letting the
[1:43:11] devil have the rest of the
[1:43:14] ground we're letting the devil just have
[1:43:16] all the rest of the ground can you say
[1:43:19] Amen see we don't want that amen well
[1:43:23] praise the Lord I'm I know I'm I'm I'm
[1:43:26] preaching I'm preaching better than

[1:45:19] team everything that I seen of brother
[1:45:22] brandham was amen he didn't quite agree
[1:45:24] you know there there there there were a
[1:45:26] lot of those folks left left his church
[1:45:28] when he brought in uh Church
[1:45:31] order and uh so they all went down to
[1:45:33] Junior
[1:45:34] Jackson's and so they were calling them
[1:45:36] what what were they calling them what
[1:45:38] what what dead birds that what was dead
[1:45:41] birds those Dead Birds go down there and
[1:45:44] and brother BR what did he do boy I'm
[1:45:47] proud of you yeah you guys are listening
[1:45:50] into my message
[1:45:52] Hallelujah he
[1:45:54] goes as my little children I'm going to
[1:45:57] give you a
[1:45:59] spanking they believe this message like
[1:46:01] we do and we're going
[1:46:04] huh
[1:46:06] what brother brandham was not ready to
[1:46:10] kick no he says if he wants to put up
[1:46:13] with that mess down there that's his
[1:46:15] problem that's what he said maybe I'm
[1:46:18] paraphrasing it a little maybe maybe
[1:46:20] that's not wor for word but he says if
[1:46:21] he want the reason why because they
[1:46:22] wanted to keep on speaking in tongues
[1:46:24] and and and and and and having gifts and
[1:46:27] and and and just messing the service up
[1:46:30] Hallelujah and brother Brandon was
[1:46:32] trying to tell him hey I believe in the
[1:46:34] gifts I'm not taking them out but it's
[1:46:36] time to put them in order and they go
[1:46:38] we're packing our bags and we're
[1:46:40] leaving brother
[1:46:42] brandham did not get on to them for
[1:46:45] leaving he got on to the ones that were
[1:46:48] left for calling them names
[1:46:54] right I just don't see that if we're on
[1:46:57] the same
[1:47:00] team praise the
[1:47:03] Lord now you say well you just you just
[1:47:06] mentioned some names I said well yeah I
[1:47:09] am but we're still on the same team and
[1:47:12] if any man should try to take you away
[1:47:14] from this word right here you've got to
[1:47:17] say no I am not going to come under that
[1:47:22] doctrine of
[1:47:23] unbelief because the doctrine of
[1:47:26] unbelief will ground the power of life
[1:47:31] out of
[1:47:36] me I want the power of
[1:47:38] life I'm not I'm not I I don't have to
[1:47:41] go criticize somebody else to make
[1:47:42] myself look good I am here to walk with
[1:47:47] God and I believe the same holy ghost
[1:47:49] that I've got the same holy ghost that
[1:47:51] they've got and I believe at the very
[1:47:53] end of the when it's all said and done
[1:47:54] the Holy Ghost that's working on me is
[1:47:56] going to be working on them and we're
[1:47:57] all going to come in I am not looking at
[1:48:00] what they're doing and they shouldn't be
[1:48:01] looking at what I'm doing we should be
[1:48:03] looking at what the prophet said and
[1:48:06] move
[1:48:10] on well can you say
[1:48:14] amen I don't want this church to become
[1:48:16] critical or to look at people critically
[1:48:19] do I want the do I believe in the
[1:48:21] presence of God yes I
[1:48:26] do and this church has been a little bit
[1:48:28] more lively than the other message
[1:48:30] churches around our
[1:48:31] area but I cannot point a finger to them
[1:48:35] and say you're not spiritual you're a
[1:48:38] bunch of dead heads over
[1:48:42] there dead
[1:48:44] birds
[1:48:47] no if I shout more than that they shout
[1:48:51] and if you shout more than they shout it
[1:48:54] doesn't make you a bit more
[1:48:56] spiritual that's
[1:48:58] right
[1:49:04] well my mother you'll I don't know I I
[1:49:07] Can't Say Never Never Say Never but my
[1:49:08] mother you'll never see my mother up
[1:49:10] dancing
[1:49:11] around my mother just don't do that she
[1:49:14] just but I'll guarantee you my mother
[1:49:16] will sit there and cry when the Holy
[1:49:18] Ghost and you'll see her occasionally
[1:49:19] jump up out of her seat and that that is
[1:49:21] woo that's Hey listen if she does that
[1:49:23] while I'm preaching I'm going yes
[1:49:27] hallelujah
[1:49:30] amen but you see she's she you're never
[1:49:33] going to see that in
[1:49:36] her but my little mother loves this
[1:49:39] message just like I
[1:49:42] do well praise the Lord do I think we
[1:49:46] see we're not against we're not against
[1:49:49] shouting we're not against sitting we're
[1:49:52] against
[1:49:53] formality that is keeping the Holy
[1:49:56] Spirit from working in the
[1:50:01] church it's a formal spirit that keeps
[1:50:05] you bound keeps you under its thumb so
[1:50:09] it don't matter whether you're shouting
[1:50:10] whether you're whe whe whether you're
[1:50:11] sitting still it that's not what makes
[1:50:14] you spiritual it's your heart that
[1:50:17] believes this
[1:50:19] message
[1:50:20] and the life of God living its life
[1:50:23] through
[1:50:26] you now do I believe that there's too
[1:50:29] much formality yes I
[1:50:31] do we can say it in a church and the
[1:50:34] word of God's not going to move us one
[1:50:36] way or the other it's not going to make
[1:50:37] you shout and it's not going to make you
[1:50:40] smile it's not going to make you more in
[1:50:42] love with him it's not going to make you
[1:50:44] pray more than we are in
[1:50:47] formality and the life is is not where
[1:50:50] it needs to
[1:50:51] be living life lives life is real life
[1:50:58] won't allow you to be ordinary life
[1:51:01] won't allow you just to sit Amen in a in
[1:51:04] a quagmire it won't allow you just to

[1:52:02] close after after these these comments
[1:52:06] here why has the spirit of the
[1:52:10] Lord why why is so
[1:52:13] many know nothing about the presence of
[1:52:16] God the spirit of the Lord
[1:52:18] moving like it should
[1:52:21] in a lot of our
[1:52:24] churches because it's either preached
[1:52:29] against with the wrong
[1:52:31] interpretation he oh we're preaching
[1:52:33] like brother Bram he was preaching
[1:52:34] against those tongues and things we
[1:52:36] don't have that problem
[1:52:42] here brother the Brenham was correcting
[1:52:44] the
[1:52:46] Pentecostals cuz he couldn't
[1:52:48] preach come on
[1:52:53] every time he tried to give an altar cuz
[1:52:55] somebody was standing up

[1:53:12] kind of confusion in the mess of
[1:53:13] churches sir so to preach against
[1:53:17] tongues and preach against the nine
[1:53:19] spirit your
[1:53:27] gifts would be there to pacify our
[1:53:31] unbelief and the lack of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:34] In Our
[1:53:40] Lives if brother if brother brother

[2:00:25] this the reason why I said we got to
[2:00:26] keep
[2:00:27] preaching sometimes I'm
[2:00:29] preaching and I know that there is
[2:00:31] things going on in the church I've had
[2:00:33] people come up to me over the years it's
[2:00:35] funny am man I've had people come up and
[2:00:37] say you got to take that one out from
[2:00:38] underneath the blood you've got to take
[2:00:41] that kick them out no more
[2:00:45] Fellowship amen and and I just keep on
[2:00:48] preaching
[2:00:49] you know what I'm doing I've got a faith
[2:00:52] that I'm going to keep on applying that
[2:00:53] token I'm going to keep applying that
[2:00:55] token and sooner or later it's going to
[2:00:57] it's going to that those words are going
[2:00:59] around the room it's going around and
[2:01:01] sooner or later that heart will open up
[2:01:03] in faith and it'll come right down and
[2:01:06] it'll change that
[2:01:09] individual it'll change that individual
[2:01:12] but it ain't going to happen when
[2:01:13] beating them up it's going to come
[2:01:15] through that life of God can you say
[2:01:18] Amen pre preach the message preach the
[2:01:20] life keep on preaching mamas daddies you
[2:01:23] have to De it with your children don't
[2:01:25] sit there and tell them how bad they are
[2:01:27] why don't you point them what God's
[2:01:29] called them to be and how good they can
[2:01:33] be while swinging the
[2:01:35] BT am correct
[2:01:39] them with a vision in mind is that
[2:01:43] right now brother brandom says you but
[2:01:47] you can't speak with tongues unless you
[2:01:49] have the gift of tongues and no doubt at
[2:01:51] all but what there are many gifts of
[2:01:54] that in this church now there are many
[2:01:57] gifts of it over here in the Methodist
[2:01:59] Church there are many gifts of it here
[2:02:02] in the Baptist Church if it was only
[2:02:06] preached so the gift could go to
[2:02:12] operating he's saying gifts are
[2:02:14] everywhere but
[2:02:16] because it's so criticized
[2:02:20] CHR the gift can't
[2:02:24] flow that's the same way it is with your
[2:02:31] children My Philosophy is there's no bad
[2:02:34] boy or
[2:02:36] girl my thoughts
[2:02:38] are there's no such thing as a bad girl
[2:02:41] or a bad boy you all come
[2:02:47] Innocent
[2:02:51] and it's us parents that have that
[2:02:54] awesome
[2:02:56] privilege of helping them to guide when
[2:02:59] the devil's trying to pull them out pull
[2:03:02] them one way or the other
[2:03:04] right and then we want the Holy Spirit
[2:03:07] to come and fill
[2:03:10] them
[2:03:13] Hallelujah
[2:03:17] now
[2:03:19] what time is it oh it's almost nine
[2:03:21] o'clock sorry guys hallelujah what time
[2:03:23] did you get me up
[2:03:26] here
[2:03:28] hallelujah brother Brandon said now you
[2:03:32] take a tree and put it away from
[2:03:34] water the first thing you know you've
[2:03:37] got little old apples they're all
[2:03:38] naughty and worm
[2:03:40] eaten but it casts its
[2:03:43] crop and that's what's the matter with
[2:03:45] the churches today you've got away from
[2:03:46] that
[2:03:47] River you've got away from them gifts of
[2:03:49] the Spirit you've got a you've just got
[2:03:51] a natural
[2:03:53] church and they get away from the
[2:03:55] spiritual gifts and the spiritual things
[2:03:57] and they cast their fruit and what do
[2:03:58] they do they're believers they live with
[2:04:01] but they live with the
[2:04:03] world act like the world steal cheat lie
[2:04:06] Smoke Drink gamble have bunk old parties
[2:04:09] in the church pay the to pay the pastor
[2:04:11] preacher everything else soup suppers
[2:04:13] and dances they cast their fruit but
[2:04:16] it's just like the world and the
[2:04:19] believer look and say there's no
[2:04:20] difference between that person and me
[2:04:23] can you say man but there in 64 he says
[2:04:27] how many in here would like for God's
[2:04:30] provided lamb to open your eyes and I
[2:04:33] just want to ask you how many wants the
[2:04:35] bloody bleeding lamb to open your eyes I
[2:04:39] want my eyes to be wide
[2:04:42] open so that you can see him here now
[2:04:47] present he said would you raise your
[2:04:49] hands God open my blinded eyes let me
[2:04:53] have my veil took off My Heart Lord that
[2:04:56] I might understand now how will he be
[2:05:00] known how will we know him by his nature
[2:05:03] what he does his Works he said I'm the
[2:05:05] vine you're the branches and the branch
[2:05:07] Bears the fruit not the vine the vine
[2:05:10] energizes the
[2:05:11] branches and if the branch ever brings
[2:05:13] forth or a Vine ever brings forth a
[2:05:16] branch it has grapes on it the next that
[2:05:18] comes out or the branch of that vine
[2:05:21] will have grapes on it if the first
[2:05:23] church that came off that vine was a
[2:05:25] Pentecostal church with all the gifts if
[2:05:28] that ever really puts out another Branch
[2:05:31] they'll write another book of Acts
[2:05:32] behind it that's what they had in the
[2:05:35] days of the Apostles and the apostolic
[2:05:37] age never ended Peter said on the day of
[2:05:39] Pentecost repent every one of you be
[2:05:41] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:05:43] the remission of sins and you shall
[2:05:44] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[2:05:46] the promises unto you and your children
[2:05:48] and to them that are fall off even as
[2:05:50] many as the Lord Our God should call as
[2:05:51] long as God is still calling the
[2:05:54] apostolic age still goes on for the
[2:05:58] promise the promise like it was back
[2:06:00] then now is to you to your
[2:06:04] children now he's the one that put that
[2:06:06] in there he's reading for the promise
[2:06:07] then he says the promise like it was
[2:06:09] back then is to you your children them
[2:06:13] that's far off even as many as the Lord
[2:06:16] Our God shall
[2:06:20] call I'm going to give you one more in
[2:06:25] 9965 brother Brenham died at the end of
[2:06:30] of uh was it huh he's in
[2:06:34] December so 9 10 11 12 three months
[2:06:40] before he passes away Jesus says I am
[2:06:43] the light and you are in him how do you
[2:06:46] get into
[2:06:47] him
[2:06:49] joining him no shaking no baptism of
[2:06:53] water no by one Spirit are we all
[2:06:57] baptized into one body which is the body
[2:06:59] of Christ and in that body is nine
[2:07:03] spiritual gifts operating through that
[2:07:05] local body that local church that's
[2:07:08] Apostolic if I ever knew
[2:07:10] it that's
[2:07:14] right you see how far we can get
[2:07:17] away
[2:07:20] you see how far people
[2:07:22] can I'm I'm I'm doing just a couple of
[2:07:25] things here that are noticeable in our
[2:07:27] churches today there's a big big deal
[2:07:31] against preachers against church and
[2:07:34] against the moving of the spirit and yet
[2:07:37] brother brandham fought so
[2:07:39] hard for that to be among
[2:07:45] us I came out of denominational
[2:07:48] Pentecost
[2:07:49] lost I know what that's
[2:07:53] like but I've also experienced God in
[2:07:55] such a supernatural
[2:07:57] way and brother brandom says every
[2:07:59] generation has a right to their own
[2:08:04] revival can you say
[2:08:06] amen and I want someone say well brother
[2:08:09] W do you speak in tongues yes I do did
[2:08:12] you quit speaking in tongues the gifts
[2:08:13] of this gift of speaking in tongues left
[2:08:15] you whenever you you came into the
[2:08:17] church right because God don't speaking
[2:08:18] tongues no more no wrong
[2:08:21] no I just learned how to operate it I
[2:08:24] just
[2:08:26] learned you're either going to be a
[2:08:29] Corinthian Church or you're going to be
[2:08:30] an Ephesian church and I want to be an
[2:08:33] Ephesian church can you say amen that's
[2:08:37] right I want to be one of those that the
[2:08:40] power of the holy spirit is flowing
[2:08:43] through
[2:08:44] me I want you young people to desire I I
[2:08:48] want y'all to see I want those gifts on
[2:08:51] the inside of you we're thankful for the
[2:08:53] guitar players and my good how many
[2:08:54] enjoyed brother uh Harry's get to our
[2:08:57] playing

[2:09:05] happy I'm tell I'm I'm happy to see all
[2:09:07] these guys and and we're thankful for
[2:09:10] that but there's other gifts that God's
[2:09:12] laid in our lives
[2:09:13] too Supernatural gifts that's within us
[2:09:17] do you believe
[2:09:19] that do you love him how many wants to
[2:09:23] get rid of that Doctrine don't let me
[2:09:26] heed to that doctrine of
[2:09:31] unbelief and don't let this preacher
[2:09:35] ever preach
[2:09:39] unbelief to this
[2:09:43] congregation you say should I preach
[2:09:45] should I pray for the preacher you
[2:09:46] should pray for the pastor more than you
[2:09:48] really think that's
[2:09:53] right any man subject to
[2:09:58] fall we're all
[2:10:03] subject but we've got a
[2:10:13] message that God so
[2:10:17] protected because we needed
[2:10:22] Purity now if it was up to me I'd say
[2:10:24] let's just all pack the doors and let's
[2:10:25] all go let's just all press play that's
[2:10:27] not what the prophet
[2:10:29] taught so we've got to line up with

[2:14:27] to the word of God and the body of
[2:14:30] Christ here on the
[2:14:32] earth is it a Doctrine to
[2:14:35] you is it a set pattern of
[2:14:39] beliefs are you in this thing for your
[2:14:43] neighbor next to you

[2:15:06] rejoice when one cries we all
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:11] cry but that don't
[2:15:14] matter is that your
[2:15:16] Doctrine
[2:15:21] is that your
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:38] Doctrine I believe more the Holy Ghost
[2:15:40] Works through us and in us and we get
[2:15:43] rid of our own
[2:15:45] doctrines and let the holy spirit so
[2:15:47] work can live in us we'll find
[2:15:51] that we need each other a little bit
[2:15:53] more than what we act
[2:15:56] like I think we'll love each other a
[2:16:00] little more than what
[2:16:01] we probably
[2:16:05] show I believe once we get those kinds
[2:16:08] of things
[2:16:09] out that wire that's carrying the PO is
[2:16:12] no longer
[2:16:16] grounded
[2:16:18] the anointing of the Holy Spirit can
