[37:45] amen but our sound man is you know it
[37:48] hey sound sound man have it hard you
[37:50] know and uh but we we appreciate U
[37:54] brother Caleb just appreciate everyone
[37:56] tonight and um I I'm sorry that I wasn't
[38:00] able to make it to the fellowship today
[38:03] um sometimes it's just best to sort of
[38:07] uh uh stay before the Lord and get
[38:09] prepared for the evening service and
[38:12] amen but i' I'd like to read here in in
[38:15] 1
[38:16] Corinthians uh the first chapter and
[38:19] we're going to start at the 17th verse
[38:21] for Christ sent me not to
[38:24] baptize but to preach the gospel El not
[38:27] with the wisdom of words lest the Cross
[38:30] of Christ should be made of none effect
[38:34] now that's that's a mouthful right there
[38:36] he sent me to preach the gospel not with
[38:39] wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ
[38:43] should be made of none effect but the
[38:46] preaching of the Cross is to them that
[38:48] perish foolishness but unto them which
[38:51] are saved it is the power of God for it
[38:55] is written I will destroy the wisdom of
[38:57] the wise and will bring to nothing the
[38:59] understanding of The Prudent where is
[39:02] the wise where is the Scribe where is
[39:04] the disputer of this world hath not God
[39:07] made foolish the wisdom of this world
[39:11] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[39:13] World by wisdom knew him not it pleased
[39:16] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[39:19] save them that pre that believe for the
[39:22] Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek
[39:25] after wisdom but we preach Christ
[39:28] crucified unto the Jews a stumbling
[39:30] block unto the Greeks foolishness but
[39:33] unto them which are called someone say
[39:37] hallelujah hallelujah both Jews and
[39:40] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[39:43] wisdom of God because the foolishness of
[39:47] God is wiser than men and the weakness
[39:49] of God is
[39:51] stronger than men let's go to the Lord
[39:54] in prayer father we want want to thank
[39:56] you for your love
[39:59] tonight and I'm so thankful that I came
[40:02] to the

[40:22] Darkness of that we're living in but I'm
[40:26] so glad for your light I pray holy
[40:29] spirit that you would just be with us

[40:44] sure love you Lord and I love these
[40:46] people I'm so thankful Lord that you've
[40:49] called me in this day to to just be an
[40:53] echo of of what as all already come to
[40:57] us in the revelation of the hour Lord we
[41:00] have no message to preach than
[41:03] yours but God what a message you've
[41:06] given
[41:07] us I pray Lord that you would
[41:10] always cause a hunger in our hearts a
[41:14] deep down desire Lord to love you more
[41:17] to know you more to have a deeper
[41:20] relationship with
[41:22] you oh God we want to go home we want to
[41:26] be with you father that's our desire and
[41:30] we're clinging to that
[41:32] promise now Lord we love you with all of
[41:34] our heart in Jesus name we pray can the
[41:38] church say
[41:39] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[41:42] seated here this
[41:46] evening
[41:48] I amen want
[41:50] to continue maybe my thought a little
[41:53] bit on the
[41:54] preacher amen and and tonight but
[41:58] building a platform for Jesus
[42:01] Christ so as
[42:03] we ministered this morning God is still
[42:06] calling and commissioning
[42:09] preachers but we are not to confuse
[42:12] these men with the intellectually gifted
[42:15] men amen because these a preacher is not
[42:21] a sermon
[42:22] maker a preacher is not one who has the
[42:26] wonderful ability of connecting dots and
[42:29] amen between the scriptures and the
[42:31] quotes these men are not lecturers these
[42:36] men amen are not one that can just lay
[42:40] it all out in a seminar fashion maybe
[42:43] but these men are set aside under the
[42:47] power of the holy spirit amen to
[42:51] represent Christ and the message of the
[42:54] hour to the people
[42:57] amen these men again are not just ones
[43:02] that bring that that that open a Bible
[43:06] and and teach it any man or woman boy or
[43:09] girl can look into the Bible and and and
[43:13] can see those things but the gospel
[43:15] brother Bram would put it this way he
[43:17] says now in the day that we can't expect
[43:21] the gospel of Christ to be
[43:23] popular he says the gospel this talking
[43:27] about the word is is not the gospel this
[43:30] is part of the gospel Paul said the
[43:33] gospel came not in word only but through
[43:36] the power and manifestation of the Holy
[43:39] Ghost is that right so the gospel is not
[43:43] the word
[43:45] only the word's just a dead letter it's
[43:49] got to take the letter quickened and
[43:52] made alive and brought to pass what the
[43:55] letter said says it'll do that's the
[43:58] gospel he didn't say go to the uh go
[44:01] teach the word he said go preach the
[44:04] word go preach the gospel the word is
[44:08] the beginning or the Forerunner of the
[44:10] Gospel the word goes out and the gospel
[44:13] of the power of the demonstration of God
[44:17] follows that word makes the word
[44:20] manifest making it the gospel amen so we
[44:25] we we we are not the the Old Testament
[44:28] had the dead L but you see Jesus found
[44:32] in his body the quickening of what the
[44:36] Old Testament had said so Jesus himself
[44:40] found that he was the word made
[44:45] manifest and that's what we ultimately
[44:48] are as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[44:52] can you say Amen so we are not teaching
[44:55] you amen a a a a a Cod of of Ethics amen
[45:01] by uh that brother brandham gave us to
[45:04] give he we we brother brandham came to
[45:09] bring the word to
[45:11] light and so should every minister of
[45:14] the message of this hour can you say
[45:17] Amen now Amen brother brandham would
[45:20] teach us that every uh uh truly anointed
[45:25] uh a a preacher is a
[45:28] prophesier amen a fourth tell teller of
[45:31] the written
[45:33] prophecy a and that the original
[45:35] anointing is upon that original prophecy
[45:39] and if it is preached Amen in the
[45:42] fullness of its original
[45:46] conception under the anointing of the
[45:49] Holy Spirit it will manifest every
[45:53] promise that God said it would do amen
[45:56] now that that that's a blessing for us
[46:00] ministers that is something that is a
[46:04] promise that has been given to us amen
[46:07] now us ministers feel very inadequate
[46:10] and we are very inadequate I feel like
[46:12] I'm one of the most inadequate uh men to
[46:15] ever stand behind a Pulpit I'm sure that
[46:18] every one of you ministers feel the same
[46:20] way uh just as you mamas and daddies and
[46:23] we all feel like we're in adequate but
[46:27] the thing is we are anointed to preach
[46:31] the gospel and the words if we stay with
[46:36] the message God will vindicate it and
[46:39] bring those promises to pass well praise
[46:42] the Lord now brother bradam and souls
[46:44] that are in prison he says he uses men
[46:47] that's true he does nothing outside of
[46:51] what he does by man we realize that
[46:54] that's his agent that's what he chose
[46:56] that why I don't know he could have
[46:59] chose the sun to preach the gospel he
[47:02] could have chose the wind to preach the
[47:03] gospel he could have made the wind to do
[47:05] things but he chose man that was his
[47:08] idea that human would speak back through
[47:12] human not himself but the word of God
[47:16] come to the prophets the
[47:20] prophesied the original word how can it
[47:22] be a true prophet he can't be because
[47:25] he's denyed
[47:26] the truth of the word and then if it
[47:28] doesn't well then this word itself as it
[47:31] is preached by the tress of the word and
[47:34] by the tress of the Holy Spirit it'll
[47:37] manifest every promise that it promised
[47:42] and that's how we know whether it's
[47:44] right or not that's what Jesus said if I
[47:47] do not that which is written of me to do
[47:50] then don't believe me can you say Amen
[47:52] so so the awesome privilege of of us
[47:56] ministers and I'm just going to talk to
[47:57] you ministers for a for a few moments
[47:59] before we uh go back to the congregation
[48:02] is we've got this privilege of bringing
[48:07] Christ to the people through his word
[48:11] right that's the reason why amen that's
[48:14] the reason why we're not out at
[48:15] McDonald's until uh 5 minutes before 7
[48:18] and then come in and amen and and um uh
[48:22] uh and and picking our Bible up and
[48:25] going out and preaching no amen we've
[48:28] got to be Anointed with the same
[48:30] anointing that wrote the book so that we
[48:33] can preach the word now brother amen we
[48:37] listen we don't want to even waste the
[48:38] people's time being up here uh uh just
[48:41] just reading some quotes and some
[48:42] scripture verses and not have no
[48:44] anointing Upon Our
[48:46] Lives amen we want the anointing of the
[48:50] Holy Spirit to come upon us and Quicken
[48:54] it now that you know that does that
[48:58] necessarily mean that you're uh uh that
[49:00] that the preacher is going to be dancing
[49:02] or does that mean that we all have to
[49:04] have a certain style or we all have to
[49:06] have amen God's got a five-fold Ministry
[49:09] and that five-fold Ministry amen I I
[49:11] sure hope no one preaches like I do
[49:14] hallelujah amen you you we don't we're
[49:16] not trying to copy one another we're
[49:18] trying to bring Jesus Christ to the
[49:22] people amen right so it's not be trying
[49:26] to uh uh uh preach like like like
[49:29] brother John or brother William but it's
[49:31] but it's the anointing I've got to be
[49:35] anointed for this cause that I'm here
[49:38] for can you say Amen so what am I to do
[49:42] my words are to preach and bring uh uh
[49:47] uh a point the people to nothing but
[49:51] Jesus Christ and what am I doing as a
[49:54] minister I am building the faith of the
[49:57] people and faith comes by the hearing of
[50:00] the word amen the Holy Spirit now
[50:03] brother Brandon would would say this in
[50:05] Messiah he says that's the thing that
[50:07] delivers the word the word goes out and
[50:11] the Holy Spirit follows the word
[50:13] wherever the word is preached you see
[50:15] your pastor preach it and the first
[50:17] thing you know is across the building
[50:20] goes the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost see
[50:22] that's right it's the conductor of the
[50:24] word the word word is the conductor of
[50:26] the spirit because where the word is
[50:29] preached the spirit follows wherever it
[50:31] goes why the spirit follows the word can
[50:35] I hear an amen amen oh I like that he
[50:38] says I like sound Bible teaching and the
[50:42] Bible holy ghost coming back confirming
[50:45] that Bible teaching if the Holy Ghost
[50:48] doesn't confirm it then you've got your
[50:50] wires crossed you've got a ground
[50:52] somewhere amen yes sir if you can get
[50:55] get the word hooked up to the Dynamo
[50:57] that great thing that puts out the
[50:59] fullness of the current he'll just set
[51:01] that little wire on fire for you that's
[51:04] right and it'll do things for
[51:07] you well praise the name of the Lord
[51:10] amen so building
[51:13] faith there is nobody that can build
[51:15] your faith like the preacher yes
[51:20] sir now people don't want that they
[51:23] don't want to hear that we're in a day
[51:25] where preachers are being dismissed and
[51:28] it's sad to say it's even it's a lot
[51:31] it's it's happening a little bit in the
[51:32] message but it's definitely happening
[51:34] around the world it's happening around
[51:37] the world until the the the church the
[51:40] preachers the nothing
[51:42] has has no effect but if but that is
[51:46] God's
[51:48] design for the church did you know there
[51:51] in in in in in HEB or in Ephesians the
[51:54] 4th chapter
[51:56] he says he's given gifts unto men he's
[51:58] given that five-fold Ministry for the
[52:01] perfecting of the Saints for the working
[52:03] of their Ministry until we all come into
[52:06] the knowledge of the Son of God Amen he
[52:10] says he's given that five-fold Ministry
[52:14] to do that and in order to bring that
[52:18] church into a rapturing condition we've
[52:22] got to be anointed right
[52:26] and it's not just us under the anointing
[52:28] the church has got to be anointed and
[52:30] there's where we go Lord amen there's
[52:33] where there's where the preacher is
[52:35] important to be under the anointing of
[52:37] the Holy Spirit not under the anointing
[52:39] of a man not under the anointing of a
[52:41] pastor not under the anointing of
[52:42] another amen someone down the road but
[52:44] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[52:47] bringing that word to life can you say
[52:50] amen Amen brother brenon would say
[52:53] Christ is the word in the beginning was
[52:55] the word the word was with God the word
[52:57] was made flesh and dwelt among us then
[53:01] the word then the anointing the oil
[53:04] represents the Holy Ghost she took the
[53:06] holy spirit it's the word and the truth
[53:09] amen Jesus said the times coming to the
[53:12] woman at the well that God will honor
[53:14] those who worship Him in spirit and
[53:16] Truth many people worship in spirit and
[53:18] not in truth many Worship in truth and
[53:20] not in spirit but when you get them
[53:23] together then you've got some
[53:25] when the Holy when the spirit of God
[53:27] gets into the word she mixed it together
[53:30] and when you get the spirit of God on
[53:32] you mixed with the word something is
[53:35] going to happen hallelujah oh God don't
[53:39] let me just be a hearer of the word but
[53:41] let the anointing come upon me right
[53:44] well praise the Lord you know I think we
[53:46] need to teach our children amen how to
[53:48] get in to the services it's important
[53:51] that they not just sit and listen amen
[53:54] but with but set and listen with a
[53:56] expectation I think I think when we come
[53:59] to church we should expect the
[54:01] supernatural I think when we go to
[54:03] prayer we should expect God to answer
[54:06] our prayer I think the church should be
[54:09] living under a faith of the for the
[54:13] supernatural in their lives Amen brother
[54:16] brother Bram says he goes on he says the
[54:19] doctor might sent you home to die with a
[54:21] Cancer and all the man knows he's done
[54:23] everything he he knows in his knowledge
[54:25] of the books of learning to save your
[54:26] life he wants to see you live but maybe
[54:29] he just don't know no more amen but you
[54:32] take God's word tonight and you mix it
[54:35] with the spirit of faith and watch
[54:37] what'll take place can you say amen and
[54:39] you see that that's the privilege of the
[54:42] preacher because the preacher has been
[54:45] given a promise that if he preaches thus
[54:48] sayth the Lord the anointing of the Holy
[54:52] Ghost will come and back that word up
[54:55] right well why would you want to preach
[54:57] anything
[54:59] else why why why would you want to
[55:01] preach something TD jakes's God or
[55:03] something that that someone else has God
[55:05] when you've got the anointed word why
[55:08] would you want anything
[55:13] else amen oh can you say Amen oh when
[55:16] you get the people in the presence of
[55:18] God Amen then things happen when you get
[55:20] the people in the presence of God
[55:22] attitudes change when you get the people
[55:23] in the presence of God amen oh All
[55:26] Things become possible brother BR I'm
[55:28] talking about jarus was he was the
[55:30] secret believer and he was so scared and
[55:33] so scared but once he got into the
[55:35] presence of Jesus then all of everything
[55:38] left him behind brother Brandon would
[55:40] say and Jesus going with little jarus
[55:42] down to his sick daughter he says now
[55:44] they're they're going along I can see
[55:46] jarus walking along now all the priests
[55:48] looking at him and said H that's that's
[55:51] what you choose amen yep that is it he
[55:54] says uh walking right along he got close
[55:57] to Jesus he had a a a change of heart
[56:01] every man that really gets close to
[56:04] Jesus can never be the same anymore no
[56:07] you can't associate with the old dry
[56:09] formal religions anymore you've got
[56:12] something in you that changes you that
[56:14] makes you different if you ever come
[56:17] close amen you can go you can go close
[56:20] to church and do anything but you can't
[56:23] come close to Jesus and be the same
[56:26] anymore amen I I say tonight amen if
[56:29] Jesus follows the word then let us
[56:32] preach that word every time the word is
[56:34] preached the anointing follows every
[56:37] come on church amen I should say amen
[56:40] God don't let the don't let it just be
[56:42] the preacher in in his in his room of
[56:44] fasting and praying and calling out to
[56:47] God before uh before a church but God
[56:50] let me spend some time alone let me
[56:52] clear my heart and say God God left the
[56:55] anointing amen just as jerus I've got a
[56:58] daughter that's dying I need the
[57:01] supernatural I need the power of God I
[57:04] need to hear what the preacher has to
[57:05] say I need the anointing to come upon
[57:09] that word and quick in life unto me
[57:13] right can you say Amen yes sir amen he
[57:18] got close to Jesus and then everything
[57:21] changed now you can see the authority

[57:26] authority of the Living God in the
[57:28] Living Church the bride the sick are
[57:32] healed the dead are raised up the
[57:35] crippled walk the blind see the gospel
[57:38] Goes Forth in its power for the message

[57:46] is in the church in the
[57:50] person now now that that that would have
[57:52] been a real good time for y'all to jump

[58:14] are the
[58:15] same the word is in the church in the
[58:22] person oh God where we're no longer just
[58:26] believing a word but now those who
[58:30] preach that word those who believe that
[58:32] word it ain't just preaching behind the
[58:34] pulpit the anointing follows the word
[58:37] that the preacher is preached the
[58:39] anointing doesn't stay upon the preacher
[58:41] it comes well praise the Lord amen so
[58:44] what is the preacher's job what is what
[58:47] is our job amen as as a preacher to the
[58:50] congregation the preacher's job is to
[58:52] bring Jesus Christ to this congregation
[58:56] it's to present the word of God to you
[58:59] so
[59:00] tangible that you want that you can see

[59:14] few of these quotes here amen he he he
[59:18] says he says I have one thing I'm here
[59:21] building a platform for one person who's
[59:24] the candidate and that's Jesus Christ
[59:26] and him alone I give my time for him
[59:30] that's right if I can get the church
[59:32] straightened out and the rest of the
[59:34] world will take care of itself that's
[59:36] right can you say Amen now brother
[59:38] Brandon wasn't building a platform amen
[59:41] for another messenger he wasn't building
[59:43] a platform for another man he wasn't
[59:46] building a platform for himself he
[59:49] wasn't building a platform but he was
[59:50] building one platform and that was for
[59:52] Jesus Christ every time he preached he
[59:54] was building a platform for Jesus Christ
[59:57] to come down and be made manifest to
[1:00:00] that congregation right every time he
[1:00:03] preached that's why people came and
[1:00:05] sought after him because he had one
[1:00:07] desire and that's to bring Jesus Christ
[1:00:11] real to that congregation amen right
[1:00:15] right man what it takes to overcome all
[1:00:19] unbelief he says now we've come here
[1:00:22] tonight to elect a man that man is the
[1:00:24] Lord Jesus and I'm trying to build a
[1:00:27] platform for him tonight that in the

[1:12:08] hallelujah amen intellectual giants
[1:12:12] can't a man take any man into battle an
[1:12:16] intellectual giant can't do that that's
[1:12:19] right brother brandham teaches us there
[1:12:21] in in uh uh with David and
[1:12:24] Saul amen and and he says he says now he
[1:12:29] says that's Pentecost
[1:12:32] today it wants to make intellectual
[1:12:35] Giants it wants to take the power out of
[1:12:38] the church it wants to make a
[1:12:40] denomination grow and bring more members
[1:12:42] that's
[1:12:43] nonsense when you bind a man to a Creed
[1:12:47] when you do that you take the holy
[1:12:48] spirit away from him he'll have to give
[1:12:51] somewhere the Holy Ghost will move on
[1:12:54] the man can't uh uh on on account of his
[1:12:58] Creed and then of course Saul trained
[1:13:00] his army Oh my he had them Israelites
[1:13:04] just knowing every which way to knock a
[1:13:06] spear off or to do
[1:13:09] anything but one day there come a
[1:13:12] challenger oh Goliath and brother it
[1:13:15] taken more than an intellectual training
[1:13:17] then it took a man that knowed something
[1:13:20] about the
[1:13:22] supernatural but God had such a man
[1:13:26] thank the Lord for that God's always got
[1:13:30] somebody shout hallelujah hallu he's
[1:13:34] always had he's had a man he could put
[1:13:37] his hands upon a little bitty Ruddy old
[1:13:41] Ruddy fella out there wasn't very much
[1:13:44] but he come up there and he said you
[1:13:46] mean to tell me that you'll let that
[1:13:48] uncircumcised Philistine defy the Army
[1:13:52] and there was old Saul Head and
[1:13:54] Shoulders above them all all of his
[1:13:55] intellectual training didn't do any good
[1:13:58] now the churches had done that has done
[1:14:00] that they got away from the Holy Ghost
[1:14:03] they got away from the power of God
[1:14:05] they've got away from the leading of the
[1:14:06] spirit amen we got sons of Kish too we
[1:14:10] we've just had one of our great Giants
[1:14:13] the other day over here in Africa it was
[1:14:14] challenged by a h a muhammadan on the
[1:14:17] scripture what happened he took water
[1:14:19] like the rest of the sons of Kish like
[1:14:21] the other son of Kish too no disregard
[1:14:23] to our brother but they had a man who
[1:14:26] know that God could deliver they brought
[1:14:29] that little David up there and he said I
[1:14:31] don't know nothing about your Spears or
[1:14:34] your intellectual training but I know
[1:14:36] one thing I know one thing I went out
[1:14:40] after a sheep that was took by the enemy
[1:14:44] and God let me bring him back he said
[1:14:46] how much more will he make me uh will he
[1:14:49] make me let me bring back this
[1:14:51] uncircumcised Philip Philistine what we
[1:14:55] need today is men and women who wants a
[1:14:59] reality and then he shouts Hallelujah
[1:15:02] who wants a reality not a Creed but a
[1:15:06] reality that's what the world needs
[1:15:09] today not Creeds not Fashions we need
[1:15:13] realities in God the world don't want it
[1:15:16] the world don't want it they they don't
[1:15:18] want to accept it but the church has to
[1:15:22] have it God wants you to have it he's
[1:15:26] the god of
[1:15:28] realities yes

[1:15:35] it God wants you boys and girls to have
[1:15:38] a
[1:15:42] reality God wants our church to have a
[1:15:47] reality God wants the
[1:15:49] supernatural to not just flow from a
[1:15:52] preacher but he wants the supernatural
[1:15:54] to flow through
[1:15:56] you he don't want you to be content with
[1:15:58] just sitting in a church he don't want
[1:16:00] you to just be content being a Christian
[1:16:02] he wants a reality but you got to Crave
[1:16:05] it are you hearing me
[1:16:08] amen oh God I'm thankful to be a
[1:16:11] preacher right now I'm thankful that I
[1:16:13] can rise up and say it is
[1:16:16] yours I'm glad God's given me that
[1:16:19] commission to say he's still alive he's
[1:16:22] still real He he'll heal he'll deliver
[1:16:26] he'll save he'll feel he'll do
[1:16:30] it I know he can do it he's done it
[1:16:34] through me and in me oh can you say Amen
[1:16:39] you see you can't stop somebody with an
[1:16:41] experience you can't talk that
[1:16:43] experience out and away from that man
[1:16:46] that's right you can talk somebody with
[1:16:48] some intellect you can talk them out of
[1:16:52] it
[1:16:53] but you'll never talk this message out
[1:16:55] of me because I found a reality in Jesus
[1:16:58] Christ and it ain't a bunch of stuff up
[1:17:01] here amen that's made me uh H you know
[1:17:04] feel pretty educated no there's a living
[1:17:07] Christ that I have found I Found Jesus
[1:17:12] to be
[1:17:13] alive
[1:17:15] amen can you say
[1:17:17] amen
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:21] amen now David he had met God at the
[1:17:24] beginning it was
[1:17:26] David that God chose at the
[1:17:29] beginning and it was God's anointing
[1:17:31] that he depended upon
[1:17:33] now it was David that had sep that God
[1:17:36] had
[1:17:37] separated
[1:17:39] Hallelujah God had done the
[1:17:42] choosing God had separated David and now
[1:17:46] it was David relying upon the presence
[1:17:48] of God in his
[1:17:50] life God had confirmed
[1:17:53] the commission God had told him I'm with
[1:17:56] you that's
[1:17:58] right God says you are a covenant you're
[1:18:02] a covenant
[1:18:04] Jew and when he looked over Adam he says
[1:18:07] Where what what's wrong why are you
[1:18:09] hiding are we not God's covenant
[1:18:15] people oh glory to God one preacher
[1:18:19] standing in the back of the crowd he's
[1:18:20] the one with all the armor he's the one
[1:18:22] standing in Head and Shoulders above
[1:18:24] them all brother pastor's back there in
[1:18:26] the back but here comes here comes a
[1:18:28] little old
[1:18:30] fella well praise the Lord maybe he's
[1:18:32] just an evangelist I don't know what he
[1:18:34] was but brother bradam says but he come
[1:18:36] with a slingshot and he come in and he
[1:18:39] brought Victory to
[1:18:41] Israel can you say
[1:18:44] Amen brother bradam says now you see God
[1:18:47] had been training him because David's
[1:18:50] commission was to take care of those
[1:18:51] sheep and when the anointing oil was
[1:18:54] upon David then David took his position
[1:18:58] seriously hallelujah
[1:19:02] amen here in in another place brother
[1:19:05] Brenham says he found out that the
[1:19:07] ecclesiastical vest of salt didn't fit a
[1:19:09] man of
[1:19:10] God and so it waited him down and that's
[1:19:13] what the trouble with a lot of men today
[1:19:16] is I meet across the land men of great
[1:19:18] standing in the high churches and Things
[1:19:20] They believe the message of the
[1:19:22] Deliverance they believe the message of
[1:19:24] the Lord Jesus and his power but they're
[1:19:26] so Shackled down with church
[1:19:28] denominations till they can't see no
[1:19:29] further than the church they won't let
[1:19:31] them any further what we need today is
[1:19:35] somebody to step out with some
[1:19:36] experience with a slingshot like David
[1:19:39] had David said I don't know nothing
[1:19:41] about your
[1:19:42] theology I I about these swords and so
[1:19:45] forth but your servant with the sshot I
[1:19:48] had an experience out there God let me
[1:19:50] kill a lion with it and kill a bear with
[1:19:52] it and if he'll let me kill a lion with
[1:19:55] it surely that uncircumcised Philistine
[1:19:58] belongs to me this
[1:19:59] afternoon and then brother bradam says
[1:20:02] give us some more Ruddy boys with that
[1:20:05] kind of Ruddy
[1:20:07] experience that'll take God at his word
[1:20:10] and believe him for everything he says
[1:20:12] is the truth that's what we need tonight
[1:20:15] dear Christian friends now I want you to
[1:20:18] notice he went out and proved exactly
[1:20:20] that God was with him because he had an
[1:20:23] experience that God could deliver the
[1:20:26] enemy into his hand by his slingshot oh
[1:20:31] Hallelujah he had something he could
[1:20:33] Proclaim he had something that why
[1:20:35] because he had already met that God he
[1:20:38] says I let me let let let me stand and
[1:20:40] testify for a little bit the god that
[1:20:42] brought the the bear down and the lion
[1:20:45] down and I brought the Lamb's back is
[1:20:48] the same God that'll anoint me to defeat
