Isaac and Ashley and um and so uh we weren't able to be here but it was so good to to see such um a good turnout in things and um so if you if you you can be you you can stand to your feet again and um um and if you could turn me up just a little bit more on these inner monitors I um for some reason they're not they're not doing much here thank you um we're going to look here at First Kings 17 and14 for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of God which he spoke by Elijah amen before we go to the Lord in prayer I would like for us to con continue to remember dad in prayer he's been very weak he's uh he's he's been in the hospital for a few days and and um uh had a lot of uh fluid on his lungs and around his heart and and and um uh so they they've been taking that off and but he's very weak and and so um I I ask that for you all to just uh as we pray let's remember remember him in prayer and remember everyone that's not here today that may be sick father we just want to thank you for your word and for your amazing grace to us and and we ask Lord that you would come uh real specially here Among Us this morning and we pray Lord that your anointing would be upon your word and upon our hearts Lord to hear your word and we're asking God that you would Lord meet every need that is present the needs that are there online I ask Lord that you would send your healing power to all of those Lord who want to be here this morning but can't I pray Lord that you will heal them Father and you see Dad there in the hospital there and in still water lord and I I pray that you'll give him strength and thank you for all that you're doing for him and bringing and Reviving and bringing healing to him Lord we believe you're our healer be with he and Mom there today at the hospital we just thank you for all of your love to us and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray can the church say Amen a amen God bless you I want to minister this morning uh take a title on a positive faith and um God's people have always been in the minority and um you know it it doesn't matter um what what part of the the uh uh Earth's history you've been in God's people has always been a minority and um they've always been rejected of the world they've always amen um they they they've just always not really quite fit into the world and Society but they're loved of God Amen God's God loves his people I I I I just I I I I don't believe that we're serving an Angry God here this morning I don't believe we're serving a God that's schizophrenic I believe that God's love is very real very genuine I believe that God loves you with an Undying Love here and um sometimes we we Believers I I I think we sometimes we we have to hang our head a little bit in shame because amen when we look at our struggles of faith and we look at our struggles well can God do it and and because I I want to say God is Not Just wanting to do it God is not just able to do it but God is willing to do it God is willing to meet you at your point of need and amen and I I I I believe that God's word and God's love will never fail his people amen the revealed word of God Amen is his word made positive so when God comes in a in a special age and he begins to say things in that particular age He is wanting that particular word to be positive to the bride so when God sends us a messenger and that messenger amen if he comes with the with the uh uh uh the words of promise and the divine heing Ing and the Miracles and the supernatural that is a positive to the elect that that word has came out of the scripture and is and is here on Earth today to be made real I believe those words are still circling the globe today I believe that we can still reach out and take the words of God and make them power in our lives H how many times have you done that you know how many times have you have you reached out in in a in a time of need and and you've just reached out and say God I believe it and and God brought the answer to you you brought the words off of the page into a positive in your life amen and so as we as as we look here at this scripture that we had read we are the setting amen is of a is of the amen the the the woman of zerath this woman is in a is in a dire need it must have been a a a a really hot morning amen as uh amen right about the the the breaking of the day now there had been a famine in the land and amen and and the the uh water that had not rained in in three years there there had been such a a drought upon the land and and and the Widow of zerath must have been amen as the prophet would say she she must have been up praying all night on this this particular morning when this Prophet came up to see her amen and a and and the prophet had even spoke three years earlier that it wasn't going to rain there was going to be no moisture there would be no due upon the land amen until he had called for it and and you see it was it was a it was because of Sin Sin had brought about this famine in the land and and and and the land had had suffered because of it and there was no rain there was no crops there was no cattle there was no oil there was no amen there was nothing and this woman and her son was fixing to die amen they were they were fixing to die now now I I want us to to to to look at this because amen you see sin it it sin will hinder us every time and we're living in a Land of sin I just want to stop here for a moment you see the curse that is Upon Our Land today is because of sin this that because there has been the amen the church world the amen the political world all around the world they have forsaken the words of life amen when they forsake the words of life then there is nothing else and the scripture says in these last days even that there would be a Great Famine that would come upon the land he says it wouldn't be a famine of of bread and water but it would be a famine of hearing the words of God Amen that there would be a famine so in this case as I as we go through this story here for a few moments you can put yourself in that situation because we are living in a Land of Great Famine amen you you you you look around there's no spiritual life hardly anywhere there amen and and and many of times that affects you in your spiritual life amen you you that there is know you're not living in a land where where everyone loves to pray and everyone loves where there's prayer meetings going on all the time like it used to be that you're not living in a land where amen Revival Services went for three and four weeks at a time amen because the hunger for the word of God is no longer there well I amen you you might as well shout amen because it's no longer there and that affects that can affect your family that can affect you as a person that can affect your church that can affect everything around you because we're living in a land where there is amen a famine but that famine was called on Amen uh by the word of the Lord you see Ahab was one of those political guys that amen he had no backbone he had no conviction had no real real love for God and and and he he had uh married into uh uh a a a a a pagan amen and and married Jezebel and you see Jezebel brought in uh all kinds of idolatry and sin into into the nation of Israel amen now and the people had fallen in in great moral Decay now the prophet would tell us that Ahab was one of the most wicked kings that had that had ever come to Israel and when he had married Jezebel amen she was the daughter of a of a Phoenician King amen and she herself was a priestess and so she brought in amen the Pagan worship and built temples and shrines and amen uh to baale and and and it was it was quite a deal so Jezebel had run the country amen and and she was a as I said here a couple weeks ago she was a a proud and strong strong woman amen a a strong minded woman she was determined and driven and and and and and she she had a desire what seemed to break the back of Israel she had a desire to destroy the power of God in Israel amen it it looked like amen she was hellbent to come in well can you say amen amen and the the as we look there at this little shom my woman this little woman was affected she was not an unbeliever she was not amen a pagan she had not bowed her knees to bail she had not kissed his lips she had not done these things but here she was amen with her with her son dying and amen she was at her very last meal and it seemed like the effects of the famine in the land amen where all had come in on her and she felt amen that God had forsaken her well do you ever feel like you've been there amen where it looks like it's all caved in on you amen you're the one who loves God you're the one that's trying to serve him you're the one and yet here we are Amen in this famine but I just want to tell you this morning amen God's got a propit for you God's got a positive word for you God's got a positive faith for you you to rise above it all oh can you say amen amen that's right so Ahab there he was he was very easy to persuade he was manipulative amen and and and and he was he he followed the polls he he done those kinds of things and and I and I want to say here this morning amen you know it's easy to go with the flow you you young men i i i God's looking for separators God's not looking looking for mixers God's looking for separators how many knows what Ahab done wrong in the first place he should have never married a pagan girl in the beginning he should have never went to well praise the Lord amen you you shouldn't be a boy if you're a Christian boy you have no business out there amen running around with a girl with amen with with with bright lips and amen and and and and stirrups hanging off her ears and and and all of those kinds of things amen you have no what are you doing flirting around with a girl that that that that is not even amen uh uh your uh you know of your belief or amen that follows the word of God Like You Believe amen I want to tell you if your heart is chasing after those girls and chasing after amen uh uh H H uh forms and and and and looking at things on your phone and things you're not supposed it shows what your heart is it showed the heart of Ahab ahab's heart was not for God his heart was for something else and I I I just want to say amen God is still a separator God separated light from Darkness God called Israel out of Egypt God separated his people to him himself because he is a jealous God can you say amen amen there there in 2 Corinthians 6:14 it says be ye not equally or unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath the righteousness with unrighteousness what communion has light with Darkness what Concord has uh uh Christ with b or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God and as God has said I will dwell with them and walk with them and be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them come out from among them and be ye separate saeth the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you amen but what did he say I will be a father of unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the almighty god well hallelujah amen First Corinthians 3:16 know you not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwells in you and if any man defiles the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are now a have amen had had all those girls there in in Israel he could have he could have went to but is but he was looking to strengthen his kingdom by reaching into another amen popular King and tried to marry them both together well are we not there in that same world today are we not in the mixture amen of the uh of the clay and the iron have we not done the same you know I want you to look at you realize that we amen that that this that this presidency that's coming in this cabinet is the most Catholic uh uh cabinet of of uh of of of I believe in history amen we have got there are more Catholics on President Trump's cabinet amen than there has than there has ever been amen and and what what does that mean I want to tell you amen that the scripture has already said that Jezebel was going to rule the world Amen that that's exactly right amen we can feel we can feel the tactics of hell all around us but now I want us to look as we as we can see the amen as we're comparing the two together there is a bride that is going to be made perfect and and have her garments perfect even in this time of famine there's going to be well praised praise the name of the Lord there's going to be the presence of God on the earth amen I want to tell you this morning be not mocked for God Amen be not deceived for God is Not mocked when you reap after the when you seow to the flesh you're going to reap after the flesh but when you sow to the spirit you will of the spirit reap eternal life and what does that mean that means we got to be amen we we got to continueing the wello right there when we're in the in our battle right there in our trenches right there where we when we're feeling like amen God is is nowhere around us I want you to look at it this morning and know that God knows your very heart God knows where you are today amen I said God knows where you are today amen I I tell you I you know it it I I was talking to somebody the other day and I amen and they said I I just can't seem to I just can't seem to come back I can't seem to to do what it takes amen I can't seem I amen I I and and and and my thoughts were this you've got to go back where you left him amen if if you feel like you're in a famine if you feel like you've left God if you feel like amen God is somewhere God is somewhere here on the earth H you've got to know that you've got to go back to find where you have left him at don't continue on well praise the Lord amen when Jesus was here amen uh as a boy and and and and as and his mom and dad his mom and Joseph amen had went on a three-day journey and and and then they they started asking around where where is Jesus and amen and no one seen Jesus they didn't realize that they had already went three days without him being with them they didn't even recognize him being gone so what did they have to do they had to go back to the temple Amen to where they left him and where they left him is where they found him and I want to say today where you leave him you will find him a well hallelujah amen y'all I'm going through a struggle brother wend I I I I amen I I I it just seems like God has left me you just need to go back go don't keep on going turn around and say God Amen What attitude did I have God where did I leave you God Amen where show me I I lead me back to you I want to know where you are I want to experience your grace I want you with me in this nighttime hour Hallelujah when you're in your night time when you can't

that easy for you me it's that easy amen a heart that says I have got to get back to Christ I've got to get back to Christ I want him I must have him amen more than I have anything else in leoty and that's where this woman was this woman was amen was was praying and she had been up all night and she had seen the amen the great dips amen the the you know the the the the the scar on his face as she

around Christianity is saying God I want to be serious with you and I must be serious with my soul amen now Israel had prospered even while living in rank sin for so long and uh you know brother brother brandham would say you know many times he said commit adultery is not sin smoking a cigarette's not sin drinking whiskey is not sin lying is not sin he says that's all attributes of sin unbelief is the sin and the re you reason you do those things and the reason why you can justify those things is because you feel like it's okay because unbelief has preached to you unbelief has taught your heart that you know it's okay and and and but but I I I I want to say Amen Christianity is is a is a rugged thing God's wanting ruggedness and sometimes I believe God even even in this in this in this incredible hour that we're living in God's been training our faith to rest solidly up on his word now he's training us and a lot of us are in the the training right now a lot of us amen you maybe you're that little little lady there amen that's been praying and asking and asking and asking and asking but God is wanting a people that is going to relieve his word and I promise you God knows where you are and he wants to see his character brought through you don't you know that God must have been really pleased with that little lady don't you know amen don't you know that God must be pleased with you when he sees amen uh the the fruit of the spirit coming out of you in the midst of your circumstance amen Faith and Hope and love and amen uh uh uh longsuffering and patience and amen those kinds of things coming out of your life can you say Amen so just as Sin has the attributes so does faith have its attributes just as Sin amen brings in rebellion and and and and and and and brings in all of these other things all amen that are that are self-related amen God brings a faith that is nothing related to you it's related to him and his word amen oh you go look at all of the amen whether it be lying or cheating or stealing or adultery amen it is all coming back to you it's all coming back to selfishness it's all coming back to heaping upon yourself but when you talk about faith amen when you talk about charity it has nothing to do with you it has everything to do with him and when there is a people on the Earth in the midst of this famine that's in the land that says I believe God you know that must do something for God Amen right there in the midst of it all when Jezebel is ruling the land yet you can stand there and say God gave a promise I I will not remove my feet from that word can you sayen hallelujah amen I don't care if they legalize everything amen they've legalized homosexuality legalized you know uh years ago in brother Brandon's day they just legalized you know uh uh liquor and amen and and these days they've legalized pot and drugs and they've legalized everything amen but I don't care what this world legalizes I Come From Another Nation I Come From Another land I come from a a holy land amen and that Faith was put in me at the new birth Hallelujah I'm living in this land but I'm not of this land I I live in America but I'm a I'm a citizen of a of a Heavenly Kingdom I'm a citizen amen of heaven where can you sayen amen I'm here oh yes and I'm walking in this land of Despair but my heart and my life my soul oh everything about me is anchored in his words he is real he is love he is peace he'll be with me he will sustain me Hallelujah can you say Amen yes sir amen oh yes God will always have a witness of his grace and power and here this Widow of the zerath he man with tears stained guys desperately calling out to God desperately calling out to Jehovah amen to fulfill his word and to see our Pure Heart of faith and trust towards him oh glory to God Amen now listen amen today the preachers are are all in this thing they they they preach because amen they they their congregation is the meal ticket in other words amen it's a profession for them so they've got to they they're they're they're looking for the amen for the audience for a bigger audience for this for that amen so that they can amen have a raise in their pay amen there there there's too many times that everything is centered around around uh uh this Earthly system but the church is not Earthly the church is Heavenly come on now amen and there's one thing that a preacher should have in mind and that is that everybody is ready for a Rapture there's one thing that the church should have in mind is that their families are ready for a Rapture what I'm saying here this morning is I've got leing on my mind amen I'm not looking at my trial I'm not looking at the storm I am looking at a promise God says when you see these signs lift up your head for your Redemption is drawing now I say here today lift up your head oh son and daughter of God rise to the occasion on the wings of faith for he shall not fail can you say amen amen some will look at their boss and say h he's the one that that that's going to sustain me amen some will look to a girl or a boy they're the one that'll sustain me man as long as they love me but I'm not looking to a boss I'm not looking to my wife I'm not looking to my kids I'm not looking to a friend I'm not I'm looking to him he's the one that'll sustain me oh hallelujah oh come on now because that little girl that that widow woman she was at the very she was at the very bottom she only had a few teaspoons of oil left she only had amen just a little bit of meal left she was truly at her end there was nothing that she could look to to sustain her but God sent her a prophet and that Prophet gave her what was needed to sustain her can you say amen amen he sent the sign of his presence now amen you say now what is the sign of his presence amen God shows up right there at the junction of time he's always shown up in the form of a prophet he done it with Moses he he he done it with Abraham he done it with Noah he done it amen he's he's done it with John the Baptist he he done it in our day amen and and and and and when God wants to the people to know that I know where I'm at and I want you to know where you're at he sends a prophet and that Prophet comes amen and it's word in due season Moses come and says here's an ark that was word in dear due season it was it was God's ability it was God sending down a supernatural ability to the people that had no ability it was the people were fixing to die they were fixing to drown they they were fixed they were under judgment but God sent a word oh bless the Lord aren't you glad that God loves you to send a Word of Promise to you aren't you glad that hallelujah amen when the when he looked down on the earth and he seen that the whole earth and he was repented of himself that he even created man he still gave an answer he still gave a remedy to Noah and to his family amen yes sir amen God brought that about Hallelujah Elijah didn't like Ahab Jezebel didn't like Ahab or didn't Ahab didn't like Elijah Jezebel didn't like Elijah amen they were wanting to kill him but there was a little widow woman that had reached her very end Jezebel wasn't going to turn to God and repent Ahab was it's it's beyond him but it was Jezebel that was saying if you don't give me we're GNA die and God caused a water Brook to dry up where he had been taken care of his Prophet gives him a vision to come over of her house well praise the Lord Elijah was looking around he maybe he had been going through the whole neighborhood looking for a woman in a yard somewhere because he had seen a woman in a yard he had seen the vision he was looking so and he's looking around and trying to find that woman Hallelujah and then he turns around around the corner and there she was there's the woman with the two sticks there's the house there's everything about it and he says woman I want you to give me to eat first now now what was God trying to do he's testing her faith he's checking her sincerity he's well praise the Lord now now now now this name it and claimant group today they they go around and they're amen they're uh uh you know you got to give me some money and then you give me 5,000 and and God will give you 10,000 well that's not the way it was amen God was checking her sincerity God was checking where she was at well bless the Lord and she surrendered everything to that prophet and God in return says your coverts are not going to go dry they're not going to be empty well praise the name of the Lord amen you see it was right there at that crucial time amen when it was so horrible to watch the child laying there but she continued to believe God Amen she tried to sleep all night amen but she seen the groans of and heard the groans of her baby but when God came on the scene it sustained her and the prophet and her house the whole famine now brother brandham would say see had been gradually getting lower and lower in the meal that night she knew that when she went to bed her little boy his father was gone she was a righteous woman a God-fearing woman that night I can see them as they nap down to pray and they they looked at his little pajama arms and they were threadbear and his little face and was marred with Hunger she give her part to him because she knowed he could he just a little longer and they'd both be gone there was no bread in the lamb there was no meal there was no oil there was no rain but yet she trusted God she couldn't sleep every once in a while he'd turn over and say mama won't you go out into the cupboard and and and look one more time and see if there's one bite of that bread left I'm so hungry I can't sleep how she had bite her lips until they would bleed she'd go out in the kitchen and raise her hands and say oh Jehovah I'm a widow who believes in you you took the little boy's father your servant up to heaven to be with you if you don't help me it won't be long until we'll be visiting him nevertheless whatever you do I love you just the same and I trust you and it seems when a person has done all that they can do and they have fulfilled every request that God has asked them to do and still he is silent when you have done all of that God has requested you to do and still he silent just be sure that you're that you know God remember faith is silently waiting he's only testing your faith to see what you will do God does that well can you say amen amen he says now it was the Hebrew children that believed the uh uh God and stood out for God when and they were sure that they were right with God and he let them walk into the fiery furnace before he ever moved but he stayed but they stayed waited silently assured that everything is all right he says oh there it was when they walked into that fiery furnace under the trial under a test they held true to the end but God was there just in a spare of a moment and he delivered them and they know that they were prayed up their sins were confessed they know they had met every requirement and yet he seemed to be silent he is only silent to test you someone shout hallelujah to see what you really are watch's on the inside of you to see if you really mean from your heart what you've been saying with your lips let that go deep we can say it with our lips but is our heart saying it can you say Amen testing it was a testing time how many how many feels like you're in a testing time maybe somebody's sitting in here this morning and you're in a testing time maybe you're in a testing time with your finances maybe you're in a testing time with your with your health maybe you're in a testing time with your children maybe you're in a testing time it's a testing time and you've been praying you've been calling and you've been waiting I want to tell you the answer's coming the answer's there the anointing is upon you amen you've not bowed your knees to bail you've not walked amen according to the discourse of this world you're standing there with an open heart you're standing there under the blood of Jesus Christ you're being tested keep your faith in him can you say amen amen hallelujah he says now when you've done all you can do and you've come through the prayer line and you've been prayed for and your heart doesn't condemn you and you're living right with God just hold on to it God has the answer God has to answer he's testing you you if you if you uh turn loose the next morning say well I I I'm no better amen I guess there's nothing to it then you didn't have faith to begin with you've got to have real faith you'll hold to the last breaths going from your body you're certain that God is God how many is certain for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him amen amen job was tested amen job was tried amen we've talked about job a lot can you say amen he was accused of being a secred sinner and there he was his flesh are rotting amen he had all these boils all around him he had lost everything hallelujah amen but God was testing him God was trying him sometimes the test is good for you amen because what that does is that causes that causes your heart to go back amen and look and see if there's any stones that have not been amen uh you know make sure there's no sin hidden somewhere in your life listen testings and trials are a blessing amen it'll make you go back amen when you get a little bur under your saddle towards somebody it shows you where you are amen when you're when you you know you've you've you you've got a uh you know you see somebody that you know lost lost their wallet and you amen it's got $1,000 in it and amen it'd be easier for you to just take the money out of it and act like it amen but it's a test for you amen it's a test for you children amen when you're in your school work and and and and you've got a you've got a challenge you can you can either cheat amen mom's going somewhere amen and you've got the score key right there and and you can mark it all down right now so you can get out and play but it's a test for you thank God for the test that he sends in our lives God is separating you from Le Osa he is separating you to himself he wants you to know who you are can you say amen hallelujah amen I was I was in school and uh they they um it was it was over at votek when we were we were we had our exams and uh and so um well the the teacher had went off and left he had left the the score key or the answer sheet and so you know we're there and and these these guys are all uh looking at that and one guy's looking around and he goes up and man hurt and scribbles down everything and one by one guys started going up there and this is back before cameras you know amen and uh well I was I was the dumbest kid in the class but I knew I wasn't going up there no it was I can't say that it wasn't tempting so so so we got the test all over with we all we all come back and the teachers got this grin on his face and uh he says uh I can tell you everyone who cheated and the one who didn't and U everyone's all looking you know nervously he had left the score sheet to another test up there to test them and they come up there writing all these answers all down just real quickly put it up there now now I was still the dummy I did not make an A+ but I I beat all of those suckers amen and all I could do they were making fun of me they were laughing at me they were and and and and here I was I was the one sitting back there gloating now he amen and uh I but but you see testing comes those kinds of testing God doesn't want any kind of cheaters in the in the classroom God doesn't want cheaters in the classroom if there's any cheaters in here amen oh I tell you what I don't like liars and I don't like cheaters amen we listen if we if and thieves amen if if if we have to amen save up money and and buy things amen then I think you should have to too how many believes that amen if a guy if a guy has to save up his money Amen to to to to to buy something nice and he has to amen then then what right does a does a bozo have to come over there and and steal it amen and one of these days you'll have to answer before God these are all tests in our lives I don't know that's kind of stuff's not in my notes but amen testing is important testing is important well somebody say testing is important amen when God when God's not answering you like you should when God's not hearing you what you think the way and he's not responding the way that he should and when you think that amen God's not where is he at I want to say God is waiting God is testing and God's wanting to promote some Sons and Daughters to a higher position in him a higher Place amen that's what we want amen men Lord plant my feet on higher ground not staying right where I'm at take me higher in you amen the test now a a positive word brings positive faith if faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and we are in a famine for the hearing of the word of God I want you to understand the Bible says in the last days there in Amos there will be a famine and yet Jesus says faith can only come by the hearing of the word of God Amen that goes that that that takes us back to Malachi the 4th chapter that there would be a restoration there would be a prophet to come back and build the altar br bring the words back where they belong so that our faith can rise in this day now listen the day that we're living in Zechariah 14:6 it and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark and it shall be one day that shall be known unto the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light light Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path now testing on that word because that word faith can can only rely upon the word of God and we don't want it to rely on position rely on on on music rely on on on anything else it relies upon that one word and we our thoughts should be centered around that word amen amen so our positive a positive faith comes from positive thoughts positive thoughts what what brother wend we are you saying mind over matter no I'm just saying I'm just taking amen Philippians 4 Philippians 4:8 whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report whatsoever things amen are pure th what think on these things think on these things so so here it is when you're in the struggle when you're in the trial when when when things are a little tipsy Topsy keep our eyes keep our minds keep our thoughts upon the promises of God yes sir Hallelujah because you're anointed for it absolutely anointed for this day absolutely I'm not saying that you're amen that you're a high roller I am saying the authority belongs to the Sons and Daughters of God so we must keep our minds not as the as as the meagerly who are who are dying from the from from the plague but we got to stand there and say God you've given me a promise amen I'm going to keep my eyes on you can you say amen amen now when we when we look especially when it comes to our healing amen we've got to drive that steak in the ground where you met the Lord you got to go you got to find out where where where he's at and if you haven't then then then you need you you've got to find that you've got to reach heaven you've got to know that you know that you know you've got to reach heaven and there might not be anything that even takes place then there might not be amen but at least you know you've got a positive Faith you have prayed through just like the Hebrew boys amen it was they had prayed through they know that God was with them live or die amen swim or sink God was with them and then you drive that you drive that steak into the ground and anytime that Satan tries to pull you back you just tie yourself to that steak amen right there that's the place that God met me well that's what you have to do with the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on you there ain't there ain't nobody that's that's that's that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the devil hasn't caused you to doubt whether you've got it there there is nobody in this building amen genuine Spirit-filled people that that that the devil doesn't try to beat you up and try to make you think but you've got to drive your steak in the ground and you've got to say this is when God told me this is when God filled me this is when God anchored my heart and I'm not going to move from it in in any way I I I know that I'm living in a godforsaken land but I'm not godforsaken I know that healing is is is not abundant around the country anymore Divine Healing but I I am a Son of God can you say amen amen we've got to change that Amen brother Brandon would say we he we want to change from hope today to positive Faith amen he said there's only one way we can get positive faith and that's by positive thinking on positive things the word of God that's right amen now he says if you know that you have met his requirements you've done all that you know to do then Faith doesn't waver it just sets still and thinks positive God or faith takes its a Everlasting grip around the Rock of Ages and it doesn't move well glory to God I I I I like this amen because brother bram's telling the opposite the other side of the story to this little woman he said when this little woman knowed that she had met all these requirements and still God was silent seemed like he didn't even care for her he didn't uh he didn't care whether she lived or died and but all the time God was working she didn't know about it but God told Elijah he dried up the brook he reached out his hand he stopped the brook from running and Elijah said Lord why did you stop and he says I've commanded a widow woman to feed you he's already commanded her and she didn't know it he might have commanded of you a little testimony of your healing and you might not know it just hang [Music] [Applause] on you might not know about it just that's what I told Daddy the other day just hang on the Miracles around the corner you say well I don't believe it well if it could happen amen when our Prophet was on the earth I'm a Son of God I can believe you say well he's an old man yes he is but so was brother da well can you say man you all you can say all but brother W you saying that kind of stuff you're a preacher and if it don't really come to pass amen don't you know what kind of oh that's the same kind of skepticism that that one guy had that boy amen that was that was all twisted up and torn up and couldn't move from his from his uh his neck down amen and and and and when somebody had prayed for him amen he says well give me he says now he says give me he's telling brother brandham Give Me A Sign amen and brother brandham what did he do he gave him scripture and he showed him the scripture and says here it is Son and he went back and started confessing to the all of the church and and and the neighborhood and the community I am healed I am healed finally the church and leaders got together and said listen you're making a mockery of God you're making a mockery of this church I'm asking we're we're demanding you to quit that amen and right then as they were there just on him and on him and he was standing or sitting there amen laying there uh amen and trying to defend his faith all of a sudden his faith came into action and God healed him and he got up out of that bed oh come on Church don't listen to your doubt don't listen to this plague of unbelief and death of Le osia somebody's going to make the word to live somebody's going to bring God on the scene somebody is going to make their faith come into reality fight fight against unbelief fight against doubt fight against that Jezebel that's trying to keep you [Applause] down man yes right when his faith when these all of these leaders come around and he looked at him and this was his this was his response the boy he says when all I have the only hope I have is God's word and you're trying to take that from me that's all I've got you don't you you're walking with your feet but it was then it was then God came down bones crackled and popped and snapped as he walked and he got up God healed The Boy Oh Glory to God I feel like chopping Devil's Head heads off Hallelujah you see that that unbelief that unbelief can be thick right here this morning what will people think what if I act what if I say I'm Healed and I'm not what if I confess and it doesn't what if and we get all in this and it takes the desperation away I say it doesn't matter if my heart has found an anchor in that word then by George I'm going to stand upon [Applause] it that's mine God gave that to me God sent a prophet my way God gave me Theus sayth the Lord God showed his picture with him that I'm going to believe him amen yes Hallelujah a positive Faith now I I preached we're living under a positive bride here a couple weeks ago or a positive word and they ask wen't you afraid brother brandom aren't you afraid you're going to get get up and say something wrong he said not at all he's promised that he would be there I've Been Around the World in different countries and different cultures and it's never failed I'm not worried God will keep his word and I say today I'm not worried God will keep his word amen he says when God said so that's all there is to it that's it if God made the promise hang your soul on it if you can believe it hang if you don't believe it stay away from it it'll harm you but if you do believe it stay with it it'll take you to the victory just as sure as the world can you say Amen what what was the promise God is sending the prophet messenger from a Vindicated Ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church heard Paul She Will mature in the word until becoming a word bride the mighty Works will be found in her that are always attending upon the pure word and Faith Can you say Amen oh God is still Jehovah Gyra God is still my provider God is still our all in all he is everything to us amen she wasn't in the king's Palace that was a bad place to be they were under judgment and I hope I hope I I hope now I'm I'm I I you know I am glad that Trump got back in just I'm just I'm I I I am those Lyon dogs been on him for that time and to see him that's that's wonderful but he ain't her ticket I'm sort of excited that he's in there because he's a dealmaker and I just have a feeling he might be making some deals with the Rome and that's our ticket home that's right that's right but I'm not I I'm not looking for him to fix America but as we see this death and as we see this contraption all setting up and as we see all oh my I mean I read the other day uh one of the most Catholic administ frustrations ever and I'm thinking oh God is keeping

China boy they got an army coming up oh Russia that that Russ Russia man they're going to go and take us into World War II and we going to do all and those are all wonderful things but well that's not that's that's not that's not we've been told to watch Rome that's where we've been told to watch and and and and as we're seeing all of this all playing out I'm saying oh dear Jesus here's a here here here's a here's a little lady here in this in this plague ridden world that is ready for Rapture can you say Amen if the musicians would come a positive Faith this nation has forsaken God but not me I'm under the blood of the Lamb I'm following his word that plague has nothing to do with me and any kind of diseases and death that wants to come our way we have a right to call upon the name of the Lord and believe him and we have a right to believe Miracles we have a right to believe for brand new pancreases and brand new livers and we've got a right to believe that Parkinson's amen patience can still get up and walk we've got we've got we've got a right to believe it I don't take away don't you take away my only hope my hope is in the Lord Jesus Christ and I refuse any devil Hallelujah I believe that God can still cure amen those kidneys and bladders and whatever else that we face and the and the blood sugars those amen it doesn't it it's already been proven in this age that God can do it it's already been proven that God can do it you're not going to take away my faith God is doing [Applause] it amen world is looking they got the stage all set for a Superman and we are getting close closer and closer whether you realize it or not we are getting closer we I like the America for I'm a patriot I I I like the America first but the world is set up for a one world government it's just the way it is [Music] and when we see these things that's all coming around us it just takes my heart back to some of those quotes that brother Brandon would say and there's there's many of them there's many of them but um uh but some of those quotes were even one of his last Visions one of his last Visions where he where he seen the uh you seen the bride coming the beautiful bride said I'm going give you the bride and that was the first bride that came and it was just so beautiful and she went around out of view and then then then God then the person the being beside him says now I want to show you give you a preview of the church and they were naked and dancing to rock and roll and led by a witch and his brother Brandon was watching his his stomach was just so turned and he he turned his head he said after all my preaching and everything that I've done and this is what I've got to give you he was [Music] faint but God says but I but I'm going to give you a preview of the bride and as she comes he looked around and the same bride that went around the first time is the same bride that's coming back but this time it was from every nation every every ethnic group every every tongue beautiful long hair beautifully dressed and they weren't marching they weren't dancing they were just walking with the grace of a [Music] woman and he could hear Onward Christian Soldiers

there and her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I'd ever seen in my life he's talking about you little bride look like I I could have been a dozen or I don't know how many was a breast but there was just in a group of them she passed by sweetly with with air and I her eyes up watching as she passed oh she was beautiful I looked at her and as she passed by he said now we shall we shall [Music] review now I think in the [Music] teaching when brother Brandon was talking about the book of Ephesians paralleling with Joshua when Joshua placed the people in that land it by the Holy Ghost it there was no questioning about it was it was it was divinely appointed and the book of Ephesians does that to us too the book of Ephesians just the if if if you look at Ephesians it is God establishing he's not talking to one of be's girlfriends he's not talking to the to to the Natural Church he's talking to a group that he has forn he's telling them you were predestinated you were chosen in Christ you were I want you to see this this is your this is your inheritance this is this is yours and I and I and I and I I I want us to to really see that because when we see ourselves as that bride of Ephesians then we can also stand there and say everything that has been placed at my disposal every promise that has been given through the lips of that messenger you say you're putting a lot through the messenger god put a lot in on that messenger now man's made things of of brother brandom I understand that they they you know they're just a lot of cuckoo out [Music] there but so did they with with with Martin Luther the one you know we've been talk we're starting to talk about church age book when they done it but that doesn't change the fact that God worked and God left us something and it doesn't matter all of this other nonsense around it and and you know to be honest there's a lot of people that have a right to to criticize they do but I've been a [Music] student as I told you earlier I'm not the sharpest knife in the in the drawer but I have been able to take these words that have been brought To Us by the prophet and go back to scripture with it it was God's spotlighting promises for you and me to believe some say well he didn't know much anything about the end time prophec he didn't said nothing about I mean there's just you know about when Israel accepting Christ and all of this and it just a little vague and that that's not to [Music] me but he's given me something to believe and that'll take me up in a ratcher there'll be another Elijah that comes in and takes care of getting the Jews [Music] ready but what I'm saying is there's a positive word for positive Faith do you believe that today God bless you what are you playing brother [Music]
