to meet the needs and speak to the people Lord Lord we just surrender all of ourselves into to you Lord that you would be the one to take control Lord and we just commit the remainder of the service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen all right if you have your Bibles let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and we'll be starting at verse one 1 Corinthians chapter 10 starting at verse one moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolators as were some of them as it is written the the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornications as some of them committed and fell in one day three and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of of the world are come you may all have your seats now the Israelites and a lot of this as I'm kind of setting my Foundation of where we're going a lot of this is going to be super familiar and um just kind of pardon me as we go through things that we've heard preached so many times but the Israelites were slaves in Egypt for around 400 years and they only came out after God had Afflicted Egypt with the plagues and completely destroyed most of Egypt and finally Moses was able to leave the Mount of the land and after they crossed the Red Sea and had gone to Mount Si then Moses sent out the TW spies to to spy out the promised land and the 12 men returned bearing the fruits of the land but 10 of the men said that they couldn't conquer because there were giants in the land and there were fortified cities and it was just too much for them to be able to take on only Joshua and Caleb believed the promise that had been given in numbers chap 14 and verse 22 it says because all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will I bring into the land wherein to he went and his seed shall possess it now the amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the Valley tomorrow turn you and get you into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea after failing to believe and trust in the promise of God the Israelites were forced to turn away from the promised land and wander in the wilderness for 40 years so that the old generation could die off this is all a part of the the history of Israel that we all know very well we all know the story of Caleb we all know the story of Joshua we all know how Israel rejected and they had to die off in order for a new generation to come up that could claim the promise that could go in and take hold of what God had put before them I want to preach this morning on the wrong side of Jordan let's turn to Numbers chapter 32 Numbers chapter 32 and we'll be starting at verse one now the children of Ruben and the children of GAD had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazzer and the land of Gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle the children of GAD and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses and to Eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying adero and dibon and jazzer and nimra and heshbon and elila and Sham and Nebo and beon even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle wherefore said they if we have found Grace in thy sight let this land be given unto the servants for a possession and bring us not over Jordan now Reuben and Gad come to Moses and come to the the other princes of the congregation as they're preparing to go over to take the land they're in preparation to it's time for us to take what God has promised it's time for us to take the land that's been given to us and Ruben and Gad come and say we actually want this land right here because we have lots of cattle we have lots of flocks we have lots of herds we are herdsmen this is what we do and this is the land that will best Supply our needs and we won't take the time to read it all but Moses gets mad he gets upset and he says why would you do this and he goes through all these different things and part of what he's bringing out is are you trying to make all the other Warriors lose heart because you're going to sit back here in land that's already conquered in safety while your brothers go across to fight and that's going to be in the back of their mind as they're fighting they're going to be thinking but they've already got land and they're done they're not fighting anymore we're here dying and still we helped them take that land and now we're here dying and they're sitting back back in safety and if we drop in in verse 16 Reuben and Gad are responding and they say and they came near unto him and said we will build sheep folds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little on shall dwell in the fence cities because of the inhabitant of the land we will not return unto our houses until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance for we will not inherit with them on Yonder side Jordan or forward because our inheritance is Fallen to us on this side Jordan Eastward and Moses responds continuing in verse 20 and says Moses said unto them if you will do this thing if you will go armed before the Lord to war and will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him and the land be subdued before the Lord then afterward you shall return and be Guiltless before the Lord and before Israel and this land shall be your possession before the Lord we're going to move forward to Joshua chapter 1 and verse 12 and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to the Hal tribe of Manasseh spake Joshua saying remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you saying the Lord your God hath given you rest and hath given you this land your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan but you shall pass before your brethren armed all the Mighty Men of Valor and help them until the Lord have given your brethren rest as he hath given you and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God's giveth them then you shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it which Moses the Lord's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising and they answered Joshua saying all that thou commandest us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go according as he hearkened unto Moses in all things so we will hearken unto thee only the Lord thy God be with thee as he was with Moses whoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all th thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of good courage and so Ruben and Gad and the Hal tribe of Manasseh followed through on what they had said that they would do when talking with Moses they built their City they built the stockades and the fenced areas for their cattle and for their sheep and for everything that they had and then they went on to fight leaving their families behind they go through and over the course of approximately seven years they're in war helping take the land this wasn't something that they were done in a few months this was wasn't something that they were done in a few weeks this wasn't something that they were done in a single year this took a seven-year approximately process to go through and after they were done they were excused Joshua portions out the land and he sends them back to the land that they had previously claimed in Joshua chapter 2 we find that after they cross over going back to the land that they have they build an altar there and all the rest of the tribes of Israel get upset CU they're like are they backsliding already are they already going to worship someone else because the Tabernacles over here here and this is where we're supposed to be offering sacrifices God doesn't want us offering sacrifices everywhere we're supposed to be coming here so why are they building another altar why are they putting something else over in this area and so we find that all the children of Israel gather together their Warriors and Phineas the son of el their priest goes with them and they go to confront Reuben and Gad out why are you doing this thing and they don't speak gently to them they are very harsh how dare you backslide already how dare you do this how dare how could you fall away so quickly how could you already be forgetting the Lord God and as we drop into Joshua chapter 22 and verse 21 says then the children of reuin and the children of GAD and the halft tribe of Manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel the Lord God of gods the Lord God of gods he knoweth and Israel he shall know if it be in Rebellion or if in transgression against the Lord save us not this day that we have built us an altar to turn from the following of the Lord or if to offer there on burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace offerings thereon let the Lord himself require it and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your your children might speak unto our children saying whatat have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel for the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you ye children of Reuben and children of GAD you have no part in the Lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice but that there may be a witness between us and you and our Generations after us that we might do the service of the Lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part in the Lord therefore said we that it shall be when they should say to us or to Our Generations in time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacri Rices but it is a witness between us and you God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord and turn this day from the following from following the Lord to build an altar for burnt offerings for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the Lord Our God that is before his Tabernacle and when Phineas the priest and the princes of the congregation and the heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of GAD and the children of Manasseh spake it pleased them and if we drop all the way down to verse 34 and the children of Ruben and the children of GAD called The Altar Ed for it shall be a witness between us that the Lord is God and that word actually translates as we look at it and see the altar of Ed that means witness and so they named this altar witness now as we go through this and I don't know maybe I'm the only one that as I've looked at this time and here or there through my life I've looked at this as a story that we don't really talk about I can't say I've ever heard a sermon ministered on this I can't say I've looked through what brother brandham talked about and he didn't discuss this situation directly and I go through it I'm like okay I know all scripture is good for teaching and proof I know that all of it's there for reason and as we read in Corinthians it's all of these are given even even there it's telling us all of these were given for examples and for a reason and so over the years I've looked at this story over and again and been like okay why why is this here what's what's the purpose behind it and you can go online and you can look at all kinds of different thoughts or takes on whether it's good whether it's bad whether it's this that or the other and I'm not going to try to cover every possibility with it but I had one thought as I'm going through with these different things in the sermon in 1965 does God change his mind brother brandom says but he has a permissive will now there where the trouble lays we try to work on God's permissive will and he'll permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will to work out together to glorify his perfect will now if you go through the original promise that was given to Abraham that your land will be from here to here and this that of the other this land is not included in that this is not part where he goes oh Abraham did wander here this is part of the promised land it's just happen to be on this side of Jordan it wasn't included now God allowed it to be given to Israel and it allowed it to be part of the nation of Israel you can even go that when you go through the history you find that Elijah the prophet came came out of this land that Gad was in possession of on the other side of Jordan now there's nowhere in the scripture that says for sure that he was of the tribe of GAD or that he was any of those but when it's Elijah the tishbite that was in this territory that Gad owned so you can't even look at it and go well there was absolutely no one that ever came out of this land worthy of anything Reuben and Gad the tribes of Ruben and Gad they came up along with all of Israel and they didn't believe they could take the land and then they had to wander through the Wilderness for 40 years and through this wandering Israel suffered Israel made mistakes Israel had to fight enemies and they ended up claiming land because they would be attacked God would help defend them and they would end up possessing land now all of these things were things that were taking place outside of the promised land they were still wandering through the Wilderness they were going through this but yet they were given some victories they were given this place and the tribes began to to grow and get stronger as the old that had been weakened by slavery both physically and mentally and spiritually began to die off they were able to grow their herds they were able to to grow what they would look at as their wealth in different ways and when they came over to the Jordan and they're preparing okay it's time for us to take this land Ruben and Gad are looking at it and they're looking at what is already here before them and they're going hey this land is good for what we have because we are the Shepherds we have the herds we have all this and they ended up looking at it and deciding that the promise on the other side of Jordan wasn't valuable enough now in no way in fact we go through the Scriptures it says they weren't trying to reject God they weren't trying to turn their back on him they were no longer even looking at it like the people before them that had said we can't take this land that wasn't their mindset they weren't sitting there going well I want to stay here because we can't take that land we're not strong enough were not powerful enough they didn't believe that otherwise they wouldn't have said hey we'll go fight they believed they were going to be able to fight and come back but what they looked at is that what they had what was already in their possession was more valuable than the promise on the other side they were willing to help fight so that the others could get what they were looking for they were willing to help fight so that the others could claim the promise but they were satisfied with where they were at they were satisfied that the with the land that they had been given God had said there was a specific land this was the promised land this is where you're going this is where you're going to be living and we know that when God speaks he doesn't change his mind if God says this is it that's it but we also know that God has a permissive will and God will allow you to deviate from his perfect will but at the same time as brother brandom said that permissive will will still glorify the perfect will but you may go through some suffering you may go through some some pain you may go through some problems because you chose not to go the way of his perfect will in also in 1965 does God ever change his mind about his word brother brandom says now listen closely now when the word test came when they went over and seen the opposition so great the great opposition they ever seen the amalekites was 10 times their size they said we look like grasshoppers their fences or their cities are so walled till they can run a chariot race around it two chariots as hard as they can go around the walls why their Spears are way out they're long and they're Giants why we look like grasshoppers we can't do it two men stood on that word Caleb and Joshua said wait a minute you two million people shut up just a minute we're more than able to do it see we're more than a match for them what were they basing on God said I've given you the land it's yours and they stood but the people had gotten married off amongst other things and all kinds of Creeds and rituals among them and they just weak wishy-washy didn't know which way to turn and what to do that's right then came the word test yes he grants you permission for to make permit your will permissive will knowing that what's in your heart he knows it you say well brother brandom I do so and so it doesn't bother me God blesses me every every day I I sing in the spirit I dance in the spirit he'll permit it go ahead that's right but what are you going to do I wear shorts and I do this it doesn't bother me I know my faith is in Christ not in what I wear but the Bible said there's something to it see what will you do you'll make a stumbling block like balum did before every one of the other women what will you do to your young girls you'll have a bunch of retas that's exactly right a bunch of little painted up Jezebel see but God will prosper you why He blesses me I don't doubt that he blessed balum too see certainly he will you're walking in his permissive will not his perfect will God doesn't change his mind because He blesses you he blessed Israel right out there for 40 years what did they do married wives raised families kissed the children pay their tithes lived right out there and God blessed them in the wilderness fed them with Mana on and on and every one of them perished because they never kept his original will his word they took his permissive way go ahead but you remember when they left Kadesh they never journeyed any farther they just went around and around in the wilderness where they could have been out in two days after that they could have been in the promised land they journeyed 40 years and every one of them died but Joshua and Caleb and the ones that stayed on the original [Music] word now it's interesting when you go through the scriptures here and what you find is Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh being on the other side of Jordan took away a protective barrier That was supposed to be between them and the enemies on that side now we know when when they went to Cross Jordan to take the land it was at the time of year when the Jordan was super high overflowing its banks you weren't supposed to be able to cross then and God allowed a miracle to part the water just like he had with the Red Sea that allowed them to come forth and get through and be able to to actually fight but if we look at that from the other side this was a normal part of the Season that the Jord would overflow like this and would become this Great Barrier that would protect you from the enemy it was a barrier that would keep you apart so that they they didn't have a God that would part the water for them and so it was meant to be when God gave this promise that here's the Jordan it's going to be a barrier between you and the enemy yes there are times of the year where they can get across but there are other times of the year where this completely prevents it and there are other times the year where it's just difficult it's not easy for the Army to get across and they're going to think twice about it before they come through but instead you find that now Reuben and Gad and this Hal tribe of Manasseh they were able they took the brunt of certain attacks if we go into second Kings chapter 15 we find the king of Assyria comes and attacks and they take the brunt of it most of their tribes are carried off in this attack now this is as we're beginning to see Israel waiting we're beginning to see them going further into eventually they're going to be completely taken into captivity but this is one where because of where they were placed they took the greatest attack because they were on the other side of Jordan now that there's nothing in the scriptures that says they were lost there's nothing in the scriptures that says they were thrown out of Israel they were no longer a part of it in fact you go through and Gad it talks about they were some of the mightiest Warriors in all of Israel they were were known as being Lion of men that would be some of the best soldiers that all Israel could produce it was a wealthy land because of how much they could make with all of their cattle and sheep and everything that they raised there because it was a land that was good for this so they were blessed in a lot of ways they were receiving a lot of on the surface blessings from God we're growing in wealth we're growing in power all these things are good but yet they were still living on the wrong side of Jordan they were still living outside of the actual promise they weren't lost they hadn't gone to where they were completely serving idolatry or serving some other gods at least no more than any of the rest of Israel did over the years but yet they were still residing outside of the promise they had still made the choice that what they had was more valuable than the promise that God had put out for them Matthew chapter [Music] 25 Matthew chapter 25 and verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh now we know in this Parable that as brother brandham talked about this a lot and that oil types the Holy Ghost well the promised land types the Holy Ghost as well when you go through these different types and here you have these these virgins and the scripture is very clear that they all virgins both the wise and foolish they're all virgins they're all living a Pure Life they're all living this clean life they're all living in a way that it looks like they're living the will of God like they're supposed to all of them appear that they're living the way that they're supposed to they all hear the cry that it's time to wake up the bridegroom is coming it doesn't say the foolish virgins slept through it they heard the cry just like the wise virgins did but it was then that they discovered wait we're out of oil we forgot to bring any we don't have any here we don't have the Holy Spirit that we need okay we have to go try and get it now the call went out and they found that they were on the wrong side of Jordan they hadn't taken Tak possession of the Holy Ghost that they were supposed to they were still virgins they were still living a Christian Life they were still living in a way that was pure and holy but they hadn't gone so far as to get the seal they hadn't gone so far as to get everything that they were supposed to John chapter 6 and verse 61 when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does doth this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit of nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with them then said Jesus unto the twel will ye also go away then Simon Peter answered himl to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered them have I not chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of Judas scariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twel we can go through all these different types in the scripture and we can look at all the different places and it's easy and in a lot of places very clear to see the break between they accepted the word or they rejected the word here we have Israel came out of Egypt they come up and they don't accept the promise and they walk away here you have Jesus and all of his disciples that are following him they've all seen Miracles they've all heard him preach and teach and all these different things and they're still there but then finally Jesus says something that they can't take and they reject and walk away we can find this one but how easy is it for us to start to fall into the mindset of we're comfortable where we're at you know what I'm comfortable with the victories God's given me up till now I don't know that I need that next promise I don't know that I need that next breakthrough I don't know that I need to be delivered of this this is just a minor thing it's not really affecting me that much I can still go to church I can still worship God I can still feel the spirit I can still enjoy myself in his presence it doesn't matter that this little thing is still holding on it doesn't matter that there's more promises out there that God's giving because I'm satisfied with where I'm at I'm not looking at it and going oh you're lost I'm not looking at it and going oh you're going to completely turn your back and walk away but yet at the same time we have to sit there and we have to wonder am I on the wrong side of Jordan right now am I too comfortable with the victories God's given me that's wonderful we thank God for every single Victory we thank God for every time he's helped us overcome we thank God for every single thing that he's set us free from but we don't stop there because God keeps promising more God still has it in the scriptures and he still holds it going here's the promised land here's what you can take hold of hey are you battling this in your body great I may have healed you before I can do it again it's still there you don't have to be satisfied hey you've had breakthroughs where you were Weeping at the altar and you were loving being in the presence of God wonderful we can do it again I still want to set you free from what's going on in your life I still want to give you more victories Ruben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh were willing to go fight to help others achieve their Victory they crossed over Jordan to go help fight but they were also willing to leave their wives and children behind their wives and children never crossed Jordan their wives and children stayed in the cities that were on the other side they never stepped foot in the Promised Land because they made the decision this land is good enough my children don't need more they're good right here they don't need to take the next step they don't need to get a breakthrough they're sitting on the front Pew that's good enough they dress right when when the world looks at them they see respectful kids that's good enough I don't need to be sitting here and praying for them to get a breakthrough I don't need to be on my knees begging God to give them the Holy Ghost because this is good enough we can get so complacent and it's not that we're going in a place that we're saying we don't believe God it's not that we're going in a place saying we're rejecting God but we sit there and we get comfortable in what God has done so far I'm not saying don't be thankful for what he's done absolutely we should be praising God every day for all the things that he's done for us all the things that he set us free from all the things that he's helped has overcome but we don't stop there we don't sit here and go well my family is good enough we go to church we live right we do this I don't need anymore because God's Still Holding Out The Promise going there's more to be had yes it means more battles yes it means there's more fights yes it means we're going to suffer some we don't go into the the battle thinking we're not going to get a wound or we're not going to struggle at all there's not going to be some battles where the arm is going a little bit hungry because the Chuck Wagons couldn't keep up or whatever it might be but you're Reuben and Gad were comfortable letting their famili stay behind they were comfortable letting their families stay in the land that they had already conquered they didn't need to cross Jordan they didn't need to step foot on the land of promise hey we have permission Moses said it's okay as long as we go fight it's okay for our families to stay here that must mean it's all just fine brother brandom would share the story multiple times about when he went to Africa and I forget which city it was in but they were in one city and they were having these Mighty meetings and God told Brother brandom you stay here this is where I want you to keep working and so brother brandom went and told those that were arranging the meetings whatever is like we need to stay in this building we need to keep doing it here this is where God has it and they were like no we've already arranged you're going here and here and here and doing all these different things we've already released the building dismissed done whatever we're going and they went back and forth back and forth and it was tearing brother brandom up because not only was it the people from Africa the organizers there they were telling me this but his own organizers themselves brother bter and different ones were going brother brandom I really think we should go do this and we should do that and so they finally get brother brandom to agree to pray about it so brother brandom goes and he's praying about it his son bill is with him and tells him dad whatever you decide I'm with you and if God said stay here whether we have the money or know what we're going to do I will stay here with you when you read when you go through it brother mam says that Billy said that he would stay up praying with him Billy fell asleep much like the disciples and brother brandom's praying and the angel comes to him and says Fine they've got you tied up is how brother brandham that's whether that's what the angel said or just what how brother brandham remembered it that's how he says is they've got you tied up go with them but you're going to suffer for it and brother brandham says that he God gave him these different signs to look for letting him know that yes you can go into this permissive will here's the signs that you will see that will let you know that what I'm saying is true brother random went to them and said God said we can go but it is going to be awful the whole way through now brother random as he's sharing that he says there was one meeting where they went off after that one town they went to where he preached and the altars were filled and he said that was God's grace giving me one meeting he said because I was in the permissive will God didn't even do that but God's grace he gave me one and then after after that they were struck by sickness they had awful weather they dealt with a situation where a pastor in this one town was going yall promised me that they would be in my church and his church only held 500 people and there were thousands of people that were there for the meeting but he's insisting no you promised me we'd have it in here not in another building and it was just problem after problem after problem everybody got sick last of all brother brandom got sick and he stayed sick and all these different things we have the permissive will that we can go into and the permissive will doesn't mean we're lost the permissive will doesn't mean that we've completely turned our back in God we've rejected and we've done any of these things but God's calling us to his perfect will Reuben and Gad got the permissive will they got permission from the Prophet The Prophet said if you do this yes you can have this land and in a lot of ways you looked at it they were blessed in that land they were able to grow their herds they were able to do all these different things from purely physical standpoint you would look at it and go God just enlarged his borders he just made the promised land bigger it's wonderful and in the permissive will yes God made the promised land bigger he gave them more land to work with he did all these things but if God said that this was the promised land then that means that that is the perfect will because that is what God Said and we have the same things in our lives where God gives us our promises and he says to do this and to do that and it's all too easy for us to begin to get comfortable or as it talks about in Revelations to get luke warm to get to the point where I'm still serving God I'm still going to church I'm still reading my Bible I'm still I haven't gone out and girls aren't going out and wearing pants they're not cutting their hair they're not doing this or doing that we're not doing anything that's obviously sin we're even building an altar to to remind us that we are part of God's promise we're building an altar here to remind our children and future Generations that we still worship God we're not building an altar in order to offer sacrifices to some false god or go off but we're content where we're at God's given me a good family God's given me good kids God given me a good job God's given me a good house God gives me this that or the other I am so blessed but the blessings of God don't always mean that we're in the perfect will we can be blessed in the permissive will we can get these blessings particularly when we're looking at it from the physical worldly standpoint going I'm blessed I have these different things I have what I'm looking for and that's enough I should be satisfied with what God's given me I say that we're supposed to be using a different word we're not supposed to be satisfied but we're supposed to be content we're always wanting to take that next problemist God's giving us but I'm content that at this 11:56 a.m. on March 2nd standing right here I am content with what God's given me at 11:57 I want more at 11:58 I want a little bit more at 2 pm I want more at on March 3rd on March 4th on March 5th I want more but I'm content where God's placed me right now I'm content with what God's given me how little or how much that might be I'm content now but it doesn't mean that I'm stopping here it doesn't mean that I'm going great I'm never leaving there are no more promises there are no more there's nothing more for me to get from God I'm where I'm supposed to be at in the church ages in the suban CHP age it says they are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt and stopped short of the promised land now those children of Israel left Egypt about two million strong they all journeyed together all saw the same miracles of god all partook of the same mana and water from the smitten rock all followed the same Cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night but only two reached the Promise Land only two were true or real Believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter then since that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference two stayed with the word when the hearts of the 10 spies failed at kades Baria Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they beli the word said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could because God had said I have given you the land after all those Israelites saw of the power and goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of God in the leoty and church age brother random says 'all right he wants you red hot or freezing one or the other don't be lukewarm just don't pretend something that you haven't got either be on fire for God or go on back in the organization don't be lukewarm it's the same thing now that's the same thing taking place in this churches here he wants you either hot or cold he don't want no lukewarm that's what Pentecost has got to a lukewarm condition they got on the they get on the piano once in a while and a few drums and bang around a little bit and get enough music somebody get up and kind of saying praise the Lord hallelujah the music goes down that's it oh my just makes God sick at his stomach there's not much going on then as a red hot revival going on in them but they had plenty of mechanical Machinery in this church you see because they was rich and oh my they was getting together and making big meetings and everything they was having a good time in this church that's all true but it's all mechanical machiner but there's no warmth of the Holy Ghost see look here what he said in here I Know Thy Works Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would that you were cold or hot and because you lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now he said I would that you were cold or hot and because you're not I just have to get rid of you that's all just sweep you out of my mouth now they have plenty of money they had great buildings they had great things going on but they didn't have no warmth of the Holy Spirit they got a United church together boy they got the biggest buildings they ever had and things going on but no Holy Spirit see that's what God sent for the church the holy spirit it's like I said Reuben and Gad weren't thrown out of Israel they weren't through the years they didn't go off into idolatry any more than the rest of Israel did they didn't become tribes that in the history stand out as they were always the ones that were wrapped up in worldly things or they were the ones that were always wrapped up in this that or the other but yet they lived outside the promise they lived outside of where they were originally called to now you can go through and you can like I said you can look at it from the physical and give the cases and reasons for why they chose to stay there and you can even make the case that because of the way the land is in the main part of Israel that if they had crossed Jordan they wouldn't have been as successful with growing their herds and raising their cattle and doing all these things and that's all valid they might not have been as successful because we all know that there is no promise in the scriptures that says being a Christian we're going to get to be wealthy and we're going to have an overabundance of everything so if they had gone over and they had crossed over with their herds and their families they wouldn't have been able to have as much land as they did they wouldn't have been able to to grow their herds and grow their cattle and all these things as much as they did there but what would have been like if they had been more centrally located and they would have been closer to the Tabernacle and they would have been closer to the sacrifice and they would have been more Incorporated with all of their brothers instead of being on the wrong side of Jordan having this line of separation between them they even said at the beginning when they were building the altar hey we're separated by Jordan and so we're building this as a as a memorial we're building this altar to remind both us and you that hey we're still here hey we still worship God hey we still live the way that we're supposed to they built this altar to [Music] remind both themselves and the rest of Israel that they weren't forgotten that they weren't lost that they were still there so even they recognized in the beginning the separation of Jordan is going to be a problem even in that they were going hey you know what this separation this probably isn't what God intended there was probably a reason that that's the promised land and this isn't because if they were on that side of Jordan there'd be no need for this altar to remind everyone that we part of the nation of Israel that we're worshiping God and doing what we're supposed to so even in the beginning whether they realized it or not they were already admitting wait something is off here yes we have permission from the prophet yes we're in the will of God because this has been approved by the prophet but yet this isn't the perfect promise this isn't the perfect will brother brandom Tells a Story one time of this person this young man that came to him saying that he was called to go to the mission field this that the other he gives this whole case of yes I'm supposed to go yeah brother Brandon listens and then goes well if God called you then you go the guy leaves brother brandom looks at the other minister that's there with him and says he's not called he's not supposed to be going but he also knew that arguing with him wasn't going to do anything and so he just said go do it and so that man walked away and I'm sure in his mind he going I've been approved by the prophet I am set but yet he had stepped right there into the permissive will of God he had stepped right there into okay I'm going to allow you and we all have times in our lives where we do that we all have times in our lives where we know what God's instructions are we know that God says we're supposed to do this or and sometimes it's more blat we see it in the scripture God says I'm supposed to do this I'm going to do this instead sometimes it's that nudging that you get on your heart and you're going Lord wants me to do this I think I really don't want to I want to go do this I want to go that way I want to I think this is a better decision for me I think this is is the better route I think this is the better thing to do and sometimes we can just get to where we're satisfied with what God has already given us we're satisfied with as I said the victories that God has already given for our families for our own personal lives go hey I I know God well enough I don't I'm not not really digging for a whole lot of extra Revelation to you know when we're when we're here and I'm listening to the Minister preach I understand what they're saying I get it they're not throwing anything new at me there's not a whole bunch of more Revelation that I need to get I'm fine we're good there's not there's not more breakthroughs there for me we can see the same thing and this can happen been in our relationships with our spouses when we start to get to the point of I love my wife I've been with her for a lot of years now and I know her well enough I know I know her likes and dislikes I there's not anything new that I need to necessarily dig for we're we're good and yet at the same time there's always something more something know well I didn't know that you liked that brand of chocolate I didn't know that you liked that style of dresses I didn't know I didn't know you had the dream that you want to learn how to do this that you want to try this new hobby that you want to try this new whatever but yet we can get complacent and content and hey we've got a good relationship that's we're good it's fine and when we talk about that I can see all the married couples kind of chuckling about the idea like okay yeah I don't know everything about my wife or my husband I've got to I've still got to ask more do more but at the same time I think we can all knowled there have been moments or maybe I'm the only one maybe I'm just preaching it myself there have been moments where I was like okay I don't have to keep studying my wife or trying to find what else she likes or what else she's interested in or what else she's wanting and if we find that on the human level how much more is that between us and our Heavenly savior the great Eternal God that had no beginning had no end how in the world am I going to hit the point that I go oh there's nothing more for God to reveal to me in his word there's no more breakthroughs I don't need anymore I've I've got enough I'm good when do we hit the point that we begin to look in the scriptures and and we look at some stories like this and we no longer care to try to find out what God was trying to tell us I've said before up here ministering look going through Deuteronomy and Leviticus is rough and there's a lot in there that I still have no clue why it's there there's plenty in there when we go through all the different laws and reg ations or go through all the genealogies and all these different things there's a lot in there that I still look at and go Lord I don't see Christ there not yet and I know brother brandom said we should be able to look at every single scripture and see Christ I'm not there I will admit it we go through particularly in the Old Testament I go through those I don't see Christ everywhere we're working on it we're trusting that God will give us more Revelation so that we can see more of it but all too often we hit the point where reading through these different scriptures or reading through the different Minor Prophets and seeing that hey God told this one you're going to lay on your side for this many months you can't move and then you're going to roll over and lay on the other side for this many months and you are going to use dried dung to bake all your food it's going to be typed as human dung but I'll let you use cow dung it's okay and I read through that and I don't immediately go Oh wow I see Christ there I know it's there and I know I can go through and we can find the types we can pull them out but I don't always immediately look at and go wow there's Christ but yet as we're going through the scriptures it's so easy for us to hit this point where we go it is common and we hit the point where we read it and we don't don't immediately go Lord can you show me yourself here can you give me that little extra Revelation to be able to see you in this Lord I see this story about Reuben and Gad having this land on the other side of Jerusalem or on the other side of Jordan I'm sorry can you give me just a little bit and maybe I'm still not going to get the whole picture maybe I'm still not going to understand it because most of the time the types God has in the scripture type in multiple ways about multiple things so just because I've got one of the types figured out doesn't mean I have the whole thing figured out but how often do we read through the history of Israel and go through these different things and then we close our Bible and put it on the shelf and go okay I've completed my daily Bible reading and we walk away when God is sitting there going hey you want to know a secret just ask me I want to tell you I want to tell you what I was hiding right there I want to tell you the little gem that's hidden there I want to tell you this little nugget that's going to let you get to know me just a little bit better that's going to let you get to know my heart just a little bit better we get so busy we get so wrapped up in life we get so wrapped up in even doing the things that we feel God is telling us to do in certain areas of Our Lives that will start to forget other areas we'll start to get complacent we'll start to become satisfied instead of trying to push and fight and Claw to get that next promise that God has put out there for us as the musicians come brother brandom in the sermon the oncoming storm he says lot was warned and when the Angels though he didn't know they were Angels when they went down their message was to Sodom come out of this sinful Place God has provided a way of Escape for you come out of this sinful Place Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom look what kind of a life they were living and Jesus compared that day with this day sinful watch when let when lot went to tell his people they laughed at him made fun of him and the sins of the city vexed his righteous Soul the Angel's message didn't stir them had no effect on them but they were asked to come out because judgment was upon the city and God was going to bring a storm of fire upon the city and they refused to walk they refused to come out they were satisfied with their sins people today seem so comfortable in sin because we own a new car because we can eat three meals a day sleep on a clean bed that's wonderful but that would be good but we for get God when Prosperity comes like that I think we've been so we preachers and we Christians has been so interested in the program of building our churches and getting a better church or something like that or a bigger Church better pews or you know how in what I mean and we've left off the main thing judgment righteousness power of the Holy Ghost Resurrection Reuben and and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh weren't lost they weren't thrown out of Israel they were still part of the chosen they were still part of the the tribes of Israel they were still heirs to the promise but yet they made the decision that this land that God has given us great victories God has allowed us to destroy the kings that are here this land right here is what we really want what we really need this is good enough I don't see how the promises of God on the other side of Jordan are better than this I don't see how the promises that are still out there are better than what God has already given me we have different struggles in our lives we have different things going on and we get that close to getting our breakthrough we get right up to Jordan and we don't walk away because we're rejecting God we don't walk away because I don't believe we can take it I don't believe we're strong enough I don't believe that we can defeat the enemy we don't turn away going God isn't strong enough to set me free or we don't turn away go saying God isn't strong enough to do this or do that but we sit there and we go but where I'm at is pretty good and you know there are other people that need those lands more than me those lands are better for raising crops why should I take some of their crop lands from them I can stay here this is better land for what I have this is better land for what God's given me I'll even help them fight through I will go up and I will pray for someone else at the altar I will help them push through to get their Victory but yet I'm content to sit here on the Pew and not ask God to help me break through to my next thing I'm content to sit here I'm content as Deacon to sit on my chair in the back and watch others going forward and watch others being touched and sit there because hey this is my job this is my role this is enough I'm supposed to keep an eye on the order of the congregation I'm supposed to keep an eye on the door that's my job that's what God has given me and I'm it's enough right here it's enough being the musician or it's enough being the sound man it's enough being the person running the video or it's enough just being a lay person sitting on a bench or we get in our mind going maybe I'm not worthy to get this breakthrough maybe I'm not worthy to get a little more maybe I know there are promises out there but Satan's been hitting me with condemnation or Satan's been hitting me with this that the other and it's I'm just not good enough to get more Revelation I'm not good enough to get the next step I don't know what it is in each one of our lives but each one of us comes to these points throughout our life and I don't know if you're at one of those points right now or not I don't know if you are I don't know what it is that's holding you there I don't know what it is that's making you sit there and go I can't claim that promise right now I don't know if it's just that you're satisfied where you're at and so you don't have that real desire real push to get more I don't know if it's the condemnation that Satan's trying to throw at you to go you're not worth getting more God's not going to give you more because you've done this or you've made this mistake or you've done that but there are more promises The Promise Land is still there on the other side of Jordan Jordan is a barrier that keeps us away from the promised land it keeps us away from that refilling of the Holy Ghost it keeps us away from everything that God wants to give us the other side of Jordan is where we get our [Music] promises and God can help you get through whatever the barrier is that's keeping you from it if it's that feeling of contentment God can give you the drive the desire that I want more I'm not satisfied with this land I'm not satisfied with just this here because I want that next step if it's condemnation if it's a Satan telling you you're not worth it God says time and time again through the scriptures I've paid the price you're dead to sin now you're my child I made you in my image I've called you my bride saying time and time again my blood has made you worthy God wants to give us that next breakthrough he wants to give us that next Revelation he wants to set us free from that little besetting sin that's been holding you so long he just wants you to start taking the step he just wants you to start moving in the direction to claim the promise cuz the promise is still there it's still yours Lord Jesus we come into your presence this morning Lord and Lord I pray that something that was said would be would just minister to the hearts of the people Lord Lord I don't know what all problems I don't know what all issues I don't know what all struggles anyone may be dealing with but Lord I know that you're still the great warrior Lord You're Still the Redeemer Lord Jesus you're still the Healer and you're still able to address every problem every challenge every issue that we may deal with Lord I pray that you would Lord Shake us out of our complacency Shake us out of the lukewarmness that would continually be trying to creep into our lives help us to press forward towards the promises that you've given us Lord help us to press forward to take hold and claim the promises that you continually hold out for us Lord Jesus Lord help us never be satisfied to just sit back where we're at Lord help us never be satisfied that we know enough of you or we're close enough to you you that we don't need to get any closer Lord I pray that you would just continue to work on each one of our hearts Lord and Lord it wouldn't be because of any special words that that I may have come up with in my mind Lord but it would be because your spirit is the one that's
