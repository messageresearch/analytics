[34:38] behold the face of my father
[34:42] which is in heaven
[34:44] amen God bless you you can be seated
[34:46] here this morning
[34:48] amen and so I want to minister uh for a
[34:53] few moments on a on a thought creatures
[34:57] of time
[34:58] end of Eternity
[35:00] amen and maybe we could uh just uh try
[35:06] to bring out the that there is a group
[35:09] of people who has been eternally
[35:12] represented in glory amen
[35:16] eternally represented you're a creature
[35:18] of time but you're also a creature of
[35:21] Eternity
[35:23] now we we want to look at at this at
[35:28] today as uh
[35:30] uh at a great drama
[35:32] Iman and uh when you have a in a drama
[35:37] there's there's going to be many actors
[35:40] there's going to be a central theme and
[35:43] there are going to be uh uh amen the the
[35:48] end product you usually have a man
[35:51] you've got the good you've got the bad
[35:53] you've got the you've got the villain
[35:56] amen and you've got the Savior praise
[35:58] the Lord and and so this morning we're
[36:02] wanting to look at this great drama that
[36:05] God has had in his mind from before the
[36:08] foundation of the world when I say drama
[36:10] I simply mean that God has had the plan
[36:13] from the beginning God has seen the
[36:17] whole scope before it has taken place
[36:20] his Spirit has been sent to Earth amen
[36:23] and he anoints uh uh men with a portion
[36:28] of his word for each and every age so
[36:32] God seen the full scope from the
[36:35] beginning to the end now if we believe
[36:37] God is God then we know that God's
[36:40] foreknowledge he could see amen the he
[36:44] could see uh uh from before creation and
[36:48] he knows what exactly is going to be
[36:50] after it is all said and done God is God
[36:53] and and he sees this great drama unfold
[36:58] amen So within the now we we within the
[37:03] good or within the framework of the good
[37:06] there are also uh three sections there's
[37:09] going to be the believer there's going
[37:12] to be the make-believer there's going to
[37:14] be the unbeliever and I want you to keep
[37:16] that in your mind for a few moments this
[37:18] morning now as we go through and begin
[37:21] to look at this drama there are some
[37:24] that are going to be ordained to eternal
[37:27] life there are some that amen uh who
[37:30] will never have each eternal life
[37:33] because Jesus Christ is the only one now
[37:37] the scripture says therein in First
[37:40] Peter 2 and 7. it says where unto you
[37:43] therefore which believe somebody say
[37:46] unto you
[37:48] which believe he is precious but unto
[37:52] them be which be disobedient the stone
[37:55] which the builders disallowed the same
[37:57] has become the head of the corner a
[38:01] stone of stumbling a rock of offense
[38:03] even to them which stumble at the word
[38:06] being disobedient whereunto also they
[38:10] were appointed now as we look at the
[38:14] drama there are actors there are there
[38:16] is a scene and there's going to have to
[38:18] be as we begin to see this scene unfold
[38:21] there's got to be amen there's there's
[38:23] there's got to be those that are
[38:26] appointed to the good and there's those
[38:27] that are appointed to the to the to to
[38:30] to the bad amen now they're in Jude one
[38:33] and four it says for there are certain
[38:36] men crept in unawares who were before of
[38:40] old ordained to this condemnation
[38:44] ungodly men turning the grace of God
[38:47] into lasciviousness denying the only
[38:50] Lord God our Lord Jesus Christ so so we
[38:54] we when we as we begin to look here
[38:57] there there are those that are going to
[39:00] be
[39:02] eternally represented and there are
[39:04] those who will end up having an end and
[39:07] of course there's only one form of
[39:10] eternal life and that is the Lord Jesus
[39:12] Christ that is God God has eternal life
[39:16] there is no there is no such thing as an
[39:18] eternal hell there is no such thing as
[39:20] an eternal devil there is no such thing
[39:23] as an eternal fire there's only one form
[39:25] of eternal life and that is with God
[39:28] Amen now that is with God now now hell
[39:32] will will will will be forever and ever
[39:34] and if you look there in the in in your
[39:37] uh in the Greek it is times and times
[39:41] and times so we don't know when if I go
[39:44] for a million years uh Help Me Maybe for
[39:47] 10 million years but the thing is the
[39:49] scripture says the soul that sinneth
[39:53] shall surely die amen now we're not
[39:56] talking about there's a body and there's
[39:58] the soul there's the death of the body
[40:00] but that does not mean that the soul has
[40:02] died you still alive even after you die
[40:06] here on this Earth you're still alive
[40:08] and you are waiting for your uh a
[40:12] judgment you have either been judged by
[40:14] the word here amen and are waiting in
[40:17] Paradise we're waiting in that first
[40:19] Heaven waiting there for for the coming
[40:22] of the Lord or you will be also in
[40:25] waiting for your judgment
[40:28] at the end and the second Resurrection
[40:31] but this but the but the soul that
[40:34] sinneth shall surely die it will come to
[40:39] an end amen but there are souls that are
[40:43] eternally represented in God and those
[40:47] will never heaven in well I I feel
[40:51] really good about right now and I ain't
[40:52] even got started hallelujah amen this is
[40:57] the record amen that their life is in
[41:00] the sun can you say Amen now now I want
[41:03] us to look at this now amen there there
[41:06] are those that are that again that that
[41:10] uh have been appointed to stumble and to
[41:14] be disobedient Jude 1 and 4 Once Again
[41:17] put it back up there sister keys for
[41:19] there are certain men crept in unawares
[41:21] who were before of old
[41:25] ordained to this condemnation now I
[41:29] would say Judas amen was part of this uh
[41:33] what was was part of this uh uh a group
[41:37] of people now Jesus called him
[41:40] the Son of Perdition they're in in Saint
[41:43] John 17 and 12. he says while I was with
[41:47] them in the world I gave them in thy
[41:50] name or I kept them in thy name and
[41:53] those that thou gave us me I have kept
[41:55] and none of them is lost but the Son of
[42:00] Perdition that the scripture might be
[42:04] fulfilled so there were scripture
[42:07] already spoken of Judas to come Judas
[42:12] was fulfilling a part of the drama that
[42:16] was spoken hundreds of years before
[42:21] and but I want you to also look Judas
[42:24] was a part of the good Judas was a part
[42:29] of the church well praise the Lord he
[42:33] sung songs he cast out Devils amen he
[42:37] done Miracles he done all of those
[42:39] things he was a part of the twelve he
[42:43] was a part of the 70. amen and when they
[42:46] all come back rejoicing the devils are
[42:48] subject to us this one's subject and
[42:50] that subject and Jesus is Rejoice not
[42:52] that the devils are subject to you but
[42:54] Rejoice that your name is written in
[42:58] heaven Judas was there a part of that
[43:03] group that 70 that was there
[43:05] and praise the Lord and the seventy left
[43:08] them and so did Judas well praise the
[43:11] name of Jesus now what is the scripture
[43:13] of course we understand that he was the
[43:15] Fulfillment of Psalms 41 and 9. yay mine
[43:19] own familiar or amen dear friend in whom
[43:22] I trusted which did eat of my bread hath
[43:26] lifted up his heel Against Me Jesus in
[43:30] another place in John 6 and 70. Jesus
[43:33] answered them have not I chosen you
[43:35] twelve and one of you is the devil so so
[43:40] in this drama that we're looking amen
[43:43] there are those that are represented
[43:48] eternally in heaven
[43:49] well bless the name of the Lord amen now
[43:52] now there there is a good there is a
[43:55] group that the scripture says amount
[43:58] that art not appointed unto wrath and
[44:02] you look there and there's many of those
[44:03] scriptures but there in first
[44:05] Thessalonians 5 and 9 it says for God
[44:08] hath not appointed us to wrath but to
[44:13] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[44:16] Christ now now as we as as I begin to
[44:19] set the stage here this morning I want
[44:22] you to understand when I say that there
[44:25] is a group that is eternally
[44:28] represented in glory I mean that you
[44:32] were forever in the mind of God and
[44:36] there is nothing the devil can do to
[44:40] take the eternal life away from you
[44:45] praise the Lord amen you have been
[44:48] eternally represented if you ever have
[44:52] eternal life you always did have eternal
[44:57] life for you were eternally in the
[45:01] thoughts of God
[45:03] oh that's a mouthful right there but
[45:05] that that should make you want to shout
[45:07] hallelujah amen first of all Hebrews 4
[45:10] and 3 lets us know he says I want you to
[45:14] rest because the works have been
[45:17] finished from the foundation of the
[45:20] world Amen if you look there in
[45:22] Ephesians 1 and 4 it says he hath chosen
[45:26] Us in him before the foundation of the
[45:33] werewolf well praise the Lord if you
[45:35] look there in Revelations 3 and 8 it
[45:38] says all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[45:40] worship Him whose names are not written
[45:44] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[45:49] from the foundation of the world Amen
[45:52] look there at Revelations 21 and 27 it
[45:56] says and there shall in no why somebody
[45:58] say no wise enter into it which is
[46:01] talking about the city anything that
[46:04] defileth neither whatsoever uh worketh
[46:07] Abomination or maketh a lie and but they
[46:11] which are written in the Lamb's Book of
[46:16] Life Now I want to say here this morning
[46:19] that there there is no place found in
[46:23] the scripture to where God is just now a
[46:27] compiling a record of names there is no
[46:30] place in the scripture that says amen
[46:32] when when my when my brother Joel gave
[46:35] his heart to the Lord last Sunday night
[46:37] or or when he comes and gets baptized
[46:40] this morning that his name is put on the
[46:42] Lamb's Book of Life there is no
[46:45] scripture no evidence that a name is
[46:49] currently a compilation of names are
[46:52] currently put on on the Lamb's Book of
[46:55] Life today either your name was on it
[46:58] before the foundation of the world or it
[47:01] was never going to be on it
[47:04] praise the Lord amen now as we said the
[47:07] drama when we we're talking now we're
[47:10] talking about we're talking about uh
[47:12] those who's got the names on the book
[47:15] and we've got we're talking about those
[47:17] named man uh who have not that
[47:20] representation can you say Amen now am I
[47:24] am I doing all right so far here this
[47:25] morning amen Revelation 17 and 8 it says
[47:30] the Beast that thou saw us was and is
[47:32] not and shall Ascend out of the
[47:35] bottomless pit and go into Perdition
[47:37] they that dwell on the Earth shall
[47:40] wonder whose names were not written in
[47:44] the Book of Life from the foundation of
[47:48] the world when they behold the Beast
[47:50] that was is not and yet is in the drama
[47:54] we've got the sinner
[47:56] we have got those who are going to be in
[47:59] the religious cycle and where God those
[48:02] that will be part of the elect
[48:06] well praise the Lord
[48:08] now you say now brother Wendell amen are
[48:12] you are you for certain I just want to
[48:14] tell you this morning that if your name
[48:16] is not in the book of life you will not
[48:21] be there in heaven that now now the
[48:24] scripture says there in Revelations 20
[48:26] and 12 I saw the dead and small and
[48:29] great uh stand before God and the books
[48:33] were open and another book was open
[48:34] which is The Book of Life and the dead
[48:37] was judged out of those things which
[48:39] were written in the books according to
[48:41] their works and the Sea gave up the dead
[48:42] which were in it and the death and Hell
[48:45] delivered up the dead which were in them
[48:47] and and they were judged every man
[48:50] according to the works and death and
[48:52] hell were cast into the Lake of Fire
[48:54] which is the second death and whosoever
[48:57] was not found written in the Book of
[49:01] Life was cast in to the Lake of Fire
[49:05] amen so so I I want to say here this
[49:08] morning we must have representation in
[49:14] glory well praise the Lord now I want to
[49:18] just sort of confuse you maybe for a
[49:20] moment because the Bible does say that
[49:24] there are some names that can come off
[49:27] of The Book of Life Now The Prophet uh
[49:31] would show us that amen that the book of
[49:34] life has two sections there is deception
[49:37] a man which has the record of immortal
[49:40] life it has the record also uh the
[49:43] second section is the Lamb's portion of
[49:47] the book now according to the the Mortal
[49:50] life the psalmist says my members were
[49:54] written in thy book of remembrance when
[49:57] as of yet there was nothing there God
[50:00] put some names in that book
[50:04] Hallelujah in that mortal life book in
[50:07] that book of a man
[50:09] your hair color and your DNA and your
[50:13] hey man your your complexion and and and
[50:16] even your events of your life God's seen
[50:20] it God's seen it if it is all a part of
[50:23] his memory at the beginning can you say
[50:26] Amen but now that section can have their
[50:29] names taken out
[50:32] Judas was part of that section amen now
[50:36] once again Judas was part of it Judas
[50:40] was part of uh the twelve he was part of
[50:45] the church now now brother Branham would
[50:48] say now I'm sure that you have noticed
[50:50] that that those names were in the uh
[50:53] were in The Book of Life were part of
[50:55] that religious order of that day that
[50:57] centered around the true God and and
[50:59] worship of him though they did not
[51:01] worship Him according to the truth the
[51:03] word and and Judas like Judas uh they
[51:07] didn't go all the way and now see how
[51:10] Judas was chosen of God he was
[51:13] instructed in truth he shared the
[51:16] knowledge of the Mysteries he had the
[51:18] ministry of power granted unto him he
[51:21] healed the sick cast out devils in Jesus
[51:23] name but when The Showdown came he sold
[51:26] out for gold and political power he did
[51:29] not go up to Pentecost to receive the
[51:32] spirit of God he was devoid of the
[51:35] spirit make no mistake about it a person
[51:38] that is truly baptized of the Holy Ghost
[51:41] into the body of Christ receives the
[51:43] fullness of the spirit and will be in
[51:46] the word all the way that is the
[51:48] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[51:50] Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right
[51:54] there and when they fail to go on in the
[51:58] word their names are taken off that book
[52:02] of life
[52:03] can you say amen amen now now the
[52:06] scripture says there and they're in in
[52:09] uh Revelations 22 he that would add to
[52:13] this word of Prophecy or take away from
[52:16] this book of Prophecy his name shall be
[52:20] taken off the Book of Life
[52:24] Hallelujah so there are those that are
[52:27] going to be a part of it amen going to
[52:30] be a part well praise the Lord I heard
[52:32] it I had a I had an Old Gentleman tell
[52:34] me one time an old preacher he says now
[52:36] listen don't cast don't don't get rid of
[52:38] all the goats God sends the goats in to
[52:41] help keep the light bills paid
[52:42] hallelujah amen he said have mercy on
[52:45] them all let God be the one that's doing
[52:47] the choosing here amen and and so uh but
[52:51] but you see but the only those that have
[52:55] been eternally represented in heaven
[52:57] will have the desire to go all the way
[53:01] with God
[53:03] praise the name of the Lord amen are you
[53:06] hearing me now brother Branham would go
[53:08] on to tell us he would say at the very
[53:11] start of our study let it be known that
[53:14] there is not one scripture that teaches
[53:16] that God is presently compiling a bunch
[53:18] of names amen a record of names this is
[53:21] all done before the foundation of the
[53:22] world and as as we will point out
[53:24] shortly it is not a question of Simply
[53:26] involving ourselves with two groups of
[53:28] people both of whom had the opportunity
[53:31] to receive eternal life that wherein one
[53:33] group received it and had their names
[53:34] placed on the record while the others
[53:36] refused it and had their and did not
[53:38] have their names he says we'll actually
[53:40] show them multitudes who were not born
[53:42] again will will be given eternal life as
[53:45] strange as that might sound but that is
[53:47] certainly true we will also show that
[53:49] there is a group of people whose names
[53:51] have been placed on that record before
[53:53] the foundation and they cannot under any
[53:57] circumstances have those names removed
[54:01] but we'll also show another group that
[54:03] whose names were on that record before
[54:06] the foundation of the world and will
[54:08] have their names removed so now we we
[54:11] now we don't we're not God we don't
[54:13] understand how why God does these things
[54:15] that he does but yet that's the way God
[54:18] does it
[54:20] well praise the Lord amen now now we can
[54:24] we can see we we can see that that God
[54:27] can show Mercy unto one for the sake of
[54:31] showing Mercy unto the elect
[54:36] well praise the Lord the scripture says
[54:38] that God raised Pharaoh up to show his
[54:43] glory in the elect
[54:48] amen y'all want to read it praise the
[54:49] Lord now you might know who are you
[54:52] you're the Sons and Daughters of God
[54:53] you've been born again of the Heavenly
[54:55] places you've got an eternal
[54:57] representation in glory when you see the
[55:00] whole when you receive the Holy Ghost
[55:02] the word of life becomes illuminated to
[55:06] you because you come from the genetics
[55:08] of God that's who you are can you say
[55:11] amen and the scripture says Jesus said
[55:13] all the father gives me I will give
[55:18] eternal life another place None Shall
[55:21] pluck them out of my hand
[55:25] man well I'm thankful for that here this
[55:27] morning amen I'm thankful now now the
[55:30] scripture says there in Romans 9 and 15
[55:32] it says uh for he saith unto Moses I
[55:37] will have mercy on whom I will have
[55:38] mercy I will have compassion on whom I
[55:41] will have compassion so that it is not
[55:43] of him that willeth nor of him that
[55:47] runneth but of God that shows Mercy for
[55:54] the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even
[55:56] for this same purpose have I raised me
[56:00] up that I might show my power in thee
[56:05] and that my name might be declared
[56:09] throughout all the Earth therefore hath
[56:12] he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[56:16] whom he will he hardeneth with thou then
[56:18] say unto me why does he yet find fault
[56:21] for who hath resisted his will name it o
[56:24] man who art thou that replies against
[56:26] God shall the thing form say to the to
[56:29] him that formed it why hast Thou made me
[56:32] thus hath not the Potter power over the
[56:36] clay of the same lump to make one vessel
[56:39] unto honor and another unto dishonor
[56:41] what if God willing to show his wrath
[56:45] and to make his power known endured with
[56:49] much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[56:52] fitted to destruction that he might make
[56:55] known somebody say hallelujah that he
[56:59] might make known The Riches of his glory
[57:02] on the vessels of Mercy which he had a
[57:06] four prepared unto Glory now I'm telling
[57:10] you today that we are living we are
[57:12] walking we are part of a drama this is
[57:16] part of a play God created it God is the
[57:19] one that chose the actors
[57:23] you're you're you're part of the drama
[57:25] he chose you to fit your part
[57:29] Hallelujah good I just can I just give
[57:32] you a little bit of can I give you a
[57:33] little bit of relief amen if you're
[57:35] worried about the future hey man it's
[57:37] just all part of the drama it's all part
[57:40] of the scene it's all what God's seen in
[57:42] his mind before the foundation of the
[57:44] world that's the reason God could tell
[57:46] us exactly how the Beast was going to be
[57:48] and about the Anarchy and how that the
[57:51] church would be that's how he did he
[57:53] already seen it he already spoke it he's
[57:55] already declared it to you
[57:57] when you receive the Holy Ghost then you
[58:01] are placed into your position in the
[58:04] body of Christ when you receive the Holy
[58:07] Ghost you are you are placed by God not
[58:10] the preacher not the mama not the daddy
[58:12] amen not by not by the bishop or Pope or
[58:15] anybody else you are placed by God in
[58:18] your place to fulfill your part in the
[58:22] great drama here on this Earth amen this
[58:25] drama is the drama of redemption this
[58:28] drama is to show amen that the power of
[58:31] the blood is greater than any Satan than
[58:34] any Antichrist than any power of of the
[58:38] church that any power of delusion but
[58:40] any power of deception it is here to
[58:43] show that God's power is greater than
[58:48] any power
[58:52] amen hallelujah so we we look at that
[58:56] now on the Apostle Peter would say Amen
[58:59] there in First Peter 1 he lacked
[59:03] accordingly to the foreknowledge of God
[59:06] the Father
[59:07] to the sanctification of the spirit unto
[59:09] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[59:11] Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be
[59:15] multiplied now God for new you see God's
[59:19] God foreknew the serpent God foreknew
[59:21] The Sinner God foreknew the saint God
[59:24] for new The Plan of Redemption amen God
[59:27] God seen the serpent God seen Adam and
[59:30] Eve God seen the fall and so God before
[59:33] the world was even created the the lamb
[59:38] was slain before the foundation of the
[59:42] world in God's plan he will praise the
[59:46] Lord some religious people try to say
[59:49] Amen that it took God off guard he
[59:51] didn't take God off guard the Bible says
[59:54] the lamb was slain before the world
[59:56] it it was all part we say when did Jesus
[1:00:00] die Jesus didn't die it was part of the
[1:00:03] plan
[1:00:04] it was in God's mind he was already
[1:00:06] slave in God's mind you you were already
[1:00:09] saved in God's mind the Bible says whom
[1:00:11] he did predestinate in whom he called
[1:00:13] and knew me whom he justified he has
[1:00:16] also already glorified in him you're
[1:00:19] represented in that lamb that was in the
[1:00:23] mind of God before there was ever even a
[1:00:27] sin
[1:00:29] Hallelujah
[1:00:31] Serpent's children cannot be a part of
[1:00:33] that but God knew the Serpent's Seed was
[1:00:35] coming
[1:00:36] the Serpent's children could not be a
[1:00:38] part of it there's no Redemption for
[1:00:40] them they never came from God there
[1:00:42] there is no representation there but you
[1:00:45] came from God and there is an eternal
[1:00:48] representation
[1:00:49] can you say man
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:52] now the scripture did say
[1:00:54] what if God Amen had that long suffering
[1:00:59] for those vessels of Wrath fit for this
[1:01:02] long suffering in other words giving him
[1:01:04] a time to repent giving them a time
[1:01:06] there's a fact the scripture says
[1:01:07] they're they're they're in I I believe
[1:01:10] it was it was in in Peter amen where
[1:01:13] where he says uh and I I thought I I had
[1:01:16] it root here amen but uh uh you know
[1:01:19] that it's not the will of God that any
[1:01:22] should perish but that all should come
[1:01:24] to repentance and the Bible says and God
[1:01:27] is long-suffering to us word
[1:01:32] can you say man oh yes God's plan comes
[1:01:37] from foreknowledge amen so election
[1:01:39] looks back to what God's seen from the
[1:01:43] very beginning amen Destiny looks
[1:01:46] forward by predestination so God can
[1:01:50] predestinate your destiny because back
[1:01:53] in his yesterdays he saw you there
[1:01:58] God could predestinate you to be there
[1:02:03] because back in his foreknowledge before
[1:02:07] there was a devil before there was a sin
[1:02:08] before there was anything God seen you
[1:02:11] already I'm so glad that I'm part of a
[1:02:14] drama that I know I I'm glad to be on
[1:02:16] the good side
[1:02:18] hallelujah amen you know these kids were
[1:02:22] going around the other day they were
[1:02:23] well there's there's plants playing
[1:02:25] something I don't know it sounded pretty
[1:02:27] scary so one of them was one of them was
[1:02:30] leading the charge we're doomed we're
[1:02:32] doomed and the rest of it was falling
[1:02:33] behind and we're doomed we're doomed I
[1:02:35] said kids that ain't the crap that that
[1:02:38] ain't the vocabulary of a Christian amen
[1:02:40] you are blessed never say I'm dude amen
[1:02:44] you're not doomed there's a group that
[1:02:47] is doomed but that's not you
[1:02:53] amen hallelujah now how do I know
[1:02:57] I don't know the full play
[1:03:02] I don't know who's the elected who's not
[1:03:05] I don't know but you know what I'm doing
[1:03:08] I'm just believing that God don't sin I
[1:03:10] just fly this way I believe it I believe
[1:03:12] God don't send serpent seed to New Life
[1:03:14] Outreach amen I I believe that if you've
[1:03:17] got a heart that wants to please God and
[1:03:20] wants to surrender to the will of God
[1:03:21] and you are looking and saying God
[1:03:23] reveal to me the truth amen that is now
[1:03:26] that has been given to me I want this
[1:03:28] Lord let me not reject it how can you be
[1:03:31] serpent seed how can you be lost
[1:03:36] well praise the Lord
[1:03:38] but Judas came so far
[1:03:41] and Judas couldn't
[1:03:44] Judas just couldn't
[1:03:47] take it off
[1:03:49] Judas followed Jesus
[1:03:53] who is the record The Book of Life
[1:03:56] follow Jesus so far
[1:04:00] he went through justification
[1:04:02] sanctification even spoke in tongues or
[1:04:06] cast out Devils worked miracles
[1:04:10] but he could not go follow Jesus all the
[1:04:13] way to Pentecost
[1:04:15] and he put Christ to an open shame can
[1:04:18] you say Amen
[1:04:19] old church amen when you see the church
[1:04:22] that is doing that we can see the drama
[1:04:25] being unfolded Amen brother Branham
[1:04:28] would put it this way amen
[1:04:30] he would say before the great thought
[1:04:33] become a word god perceived it and
[1:04:36] pre-thought these things before the
[1:04:38] foundation of the world in other words
[1:04:39] God doesn't do anything
[1:04:41] by by the spare of the moment but it's
[1:04:45] eternally another place he would say
[1:04:47] Amen he would say in the beginning was
[1:04:49] the word the word was with God the Word
[1:04:51] was God now before it could be a word it
[1:04:53] had to be a thought because a word as a
[1:04:54] thought expressed and when God seen that
[1:04:57] the enemy of this world and seen what he
[1:04:59] was going to do and what he did God
[1:05:02] thought how he would send the great Plan
[1:05:04] of Redemption and when he thought it
[1:05:06] then he spoke it and it was as good as
[1:05:09] done right then and thousands of years
[1:05:12] later came the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:05:14] died for sins and rose again some 1900
[1:05:17] years ago this morning for our
[1:05:19] justification setting at the right hand
[1:05:21] now as a high priest making intercession
[1:05:23] Upon Our confession see it's already
[1:05:27] finished
[1:05:29] and any word that comes out of God's
[1:05:31] Bible you can rest you're so upon in can
[1:05:35] you say Amen now represented
[1:05:38] God does and God always will
[1:05:42] identify himself in his Supernatural
[1:05:47] characteristics God will God will bring
[1:05:50] himself to the elect and it's not going
[1:05:54] to be in a in a in a natural knowledge
[1:05:57] it's not in coming and having a Bible
[1:06:00] study and say huh share to I said some
[1:06:03] things out of the scripture these are
[1:06:06] scripturals or these are spirit-based
[1:06:10] words that must receive the revelation
[1:06:13] of the spirit of God
[1:06:16] man now now I think this is this is
[1:06:19] pretty pretty true because God is
[1:06:22] Supernatural and these Supernatural
[1:06:24] characteristics are so far a phenomenal
[1:06:27] that it goes right over the top of of so
[1:06:30] many but you see good sweet nice
[1:06:33] well-meaning people can misunderstand
[1:06:36] them we've got all of these
[1:06:37] denominations coming out of the one same
[1:06:39] Bible but you see there's going to be a
[1:06:43] bride without spot who is going to take
[1:06:45] the word amen some say oh then we better
[1:06:48] we better uh start studying Greek and
[1:06:51] get the right Hebrew but how many
[1:06:53] dialects of the Greek the Greek Scholars
[1:06:55] don't even amen can't even agree
[1:06:57] together there are hundreds of different
[1:06:58] interpretations from hundreds of
[1:07:00] different Greek Scholars and and all of
[1:07:02] these things it's not the scholars and
[1:07:05] it's not it's the holy spirit that will
[1:07:08] reveal himself
[1:07:11] through his word through you
[1:07:15] can you say Amen amen well that Greek
[1:07:18] scholar can't agree with this and I
[1:07:19] would well we can't even get past a
[1:07:21] couple of Amen important verses in the
[1:07:23] Bible uh uh you know some some don't
[1:07:25] believe in in predestination some some
[1:07:28] believe those you know the police on the
[1:07:30] other side where you know you it's all
[1:07:33] work-oriented we got some that believes
[1:07:35] you know you got to be baptized three
[1:07:36] times Face Forward some three times
[1:07:39] backwards for the for the titles you've
[1:07:41] got so many that are going every which
[1:07:43] direction what we need today is the one
[1:07:46] who wrote the book to give the
[1:07:49] interpretation to the elect
[1:07:52] can you say Amen
[1:07:54] and when he does that then we can stand
[1:07:57] and every one of us will be in
[1:07:58] continuity well praise the Lord once
[1:08:02] again amen we go back to the brother
[1:08:05] random's uh time when he was in in uh I
[1:08:09] I believe it was there in South Africa
[1:08:10] and and there were there were hundreds
[1:08:12] of thousands of people there they were
[1:08:14] all divided up in tribes uh there there
[1:08:16] was a you know a a friction between them
[1:08:19] so they had everything on I mean it took
[1:08:20] it took it took a long time to get
[1:08:22] everything all set up Amen brother
[1:08:24] Branham comes in he's preaching and the
[1:08:26] and he's any and he and he talks about
[1:08:28] the the the the power of a resurrected
[1:08:31] Christ amen the first man to come in I I
[1:08:34] I I I believe that uh uh brother uh
[1:08:37] Billy Paul had he told Brother Billy
[1:08:39] Paul to go out and pick pick somebody
[1:08:41] out of the audience but brother Brandon
[1:08:42] had already had the vision of of that
[1:08:45] blind man being healed and so here here
[1:08:48] he comes up and he said now don't pick
[1:08:50] just anybody I want you to pick somebody
[1:08:52] that is validated somebody that I I want
[1:08:54] a noted Miracle to prove that Jesus
[1:08:56] Christ is alive amen and so
[1:08:59] um and and and if if I don't if is is
[1:09:02] this is this South Africa or is this
[1:09:03] India
[1:09:04] huh was it India okay so it might have
[1:09:08] been Bombay India amen so so anyways uh
[1:09:11] uh uh
[1:09:13] amen it's either South Africa or indeed
[1:09:15] all right putting that clause in here so
[1:09:17] so here here he's he comes up and and
[1:09:20] and and brother Branham had already seen
[1:09:22] it so he took he took all of these men
[1:09:25] from all of these I think there were 17
[1:09:27] different religions there the the Hindus
[1:09:30] and this and that and the the the Sikhs
[1:09:33] and I mean there was a whole bunch of
[1:09:34] them there that he had talked with that
[1:09:36] day and those guys that told him wow
[1:09:38] their religion was the right religion
[1:09:40] and this that and the other and brother
[1:09:41] Branham says well instead of me doing
[1:09:43] the talking I want y'all to just come to
[1:09:45] the service tonight I want you to see my
[1:09:48] God in action
[1:09:50] so when brother pranam amen as he as he
[1:09:54] turned around to these men that he had
[1:09:57] talked to in that early in the day he
[1:09:59] says I want any one of you guys to come
[1:10:02] in the name of your God and I want you
[1:10:05] to bring healing heal this man's blind
[1:10:08] eyes now those eyes amen the whites the
[1:10:12] the the pupils were gone he had studied
[1:10:15] looked into the sun all of his life uh
[1:10:18] for for so long and and worshiping the
[1:10:20] son until it was just little white Globs
[1:10:23] in his in his head Amen brother Branham
[1:10:25] had just read us read him off told him
[1:10:27] who he was what had happened and this
[1:10:29] that and the other and he tells him he
[1:10:31] says I want you guys to come and make
[1:10:33] this man whole and then he gets
[1:10:35] persistent he says come and make this
[1:10:38] man whole
[1:10:39] if your God Is Right come and make him
[1:10:44] whole now brother Branham knew who he
[1:10:47] was
[1:10:48] he was an actor
[1:10:51] in a drama
[1:10:53] he knew by Vision God sent him there God
[1:10:56] told him what was fixing to happen
[1:10:58] brother Bradham could stand there with
[1:11:00] absolute confidence
[1:11:02] and he says and now that you may know
[1:11:05] that you may know that there's only one
[1:11:08] God and he is the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:11:12] he commanded uh the blindness to leave
[1:11:14] the man began to see amen the power of
[1:11:18] God come down upon Him amen and all of a
[1:11:22] sudden there were hundreds of there are
[1:11:25] there were thousands that gave their
[1:11:27] heart to the Lord Jesus Christ it was
[1:11:30] like crazy
[1:11:32] he made the announcement after this he
[1:11:34] says I want everyone
[1:11:36] that wants to accept Jesus Christ I want
[1:11:39] you to take your Idols that you've got I
[1:11:41] want you to throw them down on the
[1:11:42] ground amen and denounce those Idols he
[1:11:45] said there was a Stomp and Stampede
[1:11:47] going on Dust flying everywhere amen as
[1:11:51] they took their idols and they were
[1:11:53] stomping them on the ground amen and so
[1:11:56] then he then he asked how many you know
[1:11:58] accepted Christ and raised their hands
[1:12:00] and there was about 30 000 people there
[1:12:02] and and so they they said well maybe
[1:12:05] they didn't understand only raise your
[1:12:07] hands if you've accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ amen and they raised their hands
[1:12:12] thirty thousand people saw the
[1:12:14] Supernatural and they gave their heart
[1:12:16] to the Lord
[1:12:18] but another thing that was more
[1:12:21] incredible than raising their hands took
[1:12:24] place
[1:12:25] all of a sudden those natives that
[1:12:28] didn't know the right hand from the left
[1:12:30] some of them didn't have nothing but a
[1:12:32] loincloth on they were they were as
[1:12:35] naked as naked could be out there all of
[1:12:38] a sudden those
[1:12:40] Hallelujah
[1:12:42] that the holy brother random didn't
[1:12:44] teach them nothing brother Bradham
[1:12:45] didn't show them nothing all of a sudden
[1:12:48] the ones that the Holy Spirit
[1:12:54] women begin to separate themselves from
[1:12:56] the men and they begin what happened the
[1:12:59] spirit the supernatural spirit of God
[1:13:05] if we would get the supernatural spirit
[1:13:07] of God back in the Church of the Living
[1:13:09] God you wouldn't have to have all of the
[1:13:11] the do's and the notes there would be a
[1:13:13] holy ghost to tell you
[1:13:17] there wouldn't be no argument well show
[1:13:18] me how long is long show me whether it's
[1:13:20] right or wrong show me where well I want
[1:13:23] proof of this I want proof that you get
[1:13:25] the Holy Ghost you won't have to have
[1:13:26] proof you'll have your own proof
[1:13:30] he'll praise the Lord can you say Amen
[1:13:34] when the supernatural comes the elect
[1:13:37] Knowles when the supernatural Falls the
[1:13:41] Holy Spirit was falling upon the 300 000
[1:13:44] but there were 30 000 in there that the
[1:13:48] supernatural presence of God ignited
[1:13:51] something on the inside of their hearts
[1:13:55] oh the glory to God that just does
[1:13:57] something
[1:13:58] so there is a seed of God
[1:14:02] predestinated of God and when the spirit
[1:14:05] of God falls upon it there is a
[1:14:07] supernatural effect that takes place
[1:14:11] well praise the Lord
[1:14:13] now I say today that there are in this
[1:14:15] drama there are those that are dominated
[1:14:18] by demons they're dominated by the
[1:14:20] spirit of the Antichrist the religious
[1:14:23] very religious a man they go to church
[1:14:25] they do those things and yet they are
[1:14:28] under the control or the auspice of
[1:14:31] spirits
[1:14:32] Paul talked about it amen it's wrote In
[1:14:35] the book of Jude it's wrote In the book
[1:14:36] of James it's wrote In the book of of
[1:14:38] Peter amen it's rodents in in to the
[1:14:41] Thessalonian church it's wrote In the
[1:14:43] book of Romans this is all containing
[1:14:45] inside the church where demon powers
[1:14:47] have control take their place but this
[1:14:50] is part of that that God had already
[1:14:53] seen But I say today and I want to
[1:14:56] finish my thoughts up on this we and
[1:14:58] this is my message here this was just a
[1:15:00] a leading up to it this part of the play
[1:15:04] is to be a Supernatural part of the play
[1:15:08] be it Demon's powers under the
[1:15:11] Antichrist Spirit has assumed their
[1:15:14] seeds doing their things but there is
[1:15:18] who under the supernatural power of God
[1:15:24] will do the Greater Works
[1:15:26] [Applause]
[1:15:28] she's not under the control of demons
[1:15:31] she's not under the control of of the
[1:15:33] Antichrist Spirit she's not out of the
[1:15:35] control of Rome she is under a Heavenly
[1:15:39] influence in her life
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:46] think about Joseph when the angel
[1:15:48] appeared to Mary
[1:15:49] now he couldn't understand how a virgin
[1:15:51] how his virgin
[1:15:54] could have a
[1:15:56] a baby
[1:15:58] it was too much for his Limited
[1:16:01] well bless the Lord
[1:16:04] he was a creature of time but he was
[1:16:06] also a creature of Eternity
[1:16:07] and he's looking at this and he's
[1:16:10] looking at his limited find that
[1:16:11] comprehension Mary comes to him with the
[1:16:14] news of the angel
[1:16:15] and and she's looking up at him with
[1:16:18] with a pretty big brown eyes and she
[1:16:22] she's saying honey I've got something I
[1:16:24] got to tell you as we're engaged
[1:16:27] amen the angel Gabriel is
[1:16:30] came to me
[1:16:32] and uh Joseph
[1:16:36] the angel told me that the baby that I'm
[1:16:38] carrying
[1:16:39] and then I I'm I'm carrying the baby
[1:16:42] of God
[1:16:43] that it's been conceived of the Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost Joseph
[1:16:47] this baby is not yours
[1:16:51] it is finite thinking he's looking and
[1:16:55] he's saying
[1:16:59] Dear God
[1:17:01] I thought that I had a woman that was
[1:17:03] true and that and here she is a floozy
[1:17:07] and the Bible says that Joseph is now
[1:17:09] wanting to privately put her away
[1:17:11] and that's looking now now if Joseph
[1:17:14] would have simply taken the the facts
[1:17:16] taking the events of the day back to
[1:17:18] scripture he would understand that he's
[1:17:19] part of a drama
[1:17:21] he would understand that this that there
[1:17:23] was a virgin that was going to conceive
[1:17:25] but he would also have amen the lineage
[1:17:28] of David can you say Amen
[1:17:31] how Joseph wanted to believe that but
[1:17:34] intellectually he could not comprehend
[1:17:37] what God was doing
[1:17:40] he was part of the plan
[1:17:43] he was part of the plan but he was
[1:17:46] having a hard time understanding the
[1:17:49] plan
[1:17:50] good man just man
[1:17:53] wonderful man
[1:17:55] but he didn't have a clue

[1:20:03] to hide men and women trying to hide
[1:20:05] from each other
[1:20:07] what was it they were the elect of God
[1:20:10] represented in the book of life before
[1:20:13] the foundation of the world

[1:31:42] that and take God's word and say I'm
[1:31:44] gonna I'm just gonna believe what you

[1:32:21] section of the book
[1:32:23] your name is written in the Supernatural
[1:32:25] word of the day
[1:32:27] now brother Branham says God was
[1:32:29] determined
[1:32:30] that he had saved his people
[1:32:31] predestinated Church
[1:32:34] he had to do it himself
[1:32:35] because he predestinated it before the
[1:32:37] foundation of the world
[1:32:39] man's a failure always will be he's a
[1:32:41] failure to start with he always he will
[1:32:44] always be a failure but God in his
[1:32:45] predestination and his own great
[1:32:48] infinite mind planned the plan
[1:32:51] to put a real Vine down
[1:32:53] he planted it on this Earth the vine the
[1:32:56] righteous Vine not a denomination not a
[1:32:58] church not a Creed but a man
[1:33:00] himself made flesh
[1:33:03] he manifested his peace his power the
[1:33:05] great angel of God the great Jehovah was
[1:33:07] with him and in him dwelt the fullness
[1:33:09] of the godhead bodily
[1:33:11] men did not believe he believe in him
[1:33:14] and disbelieved him because he could he
[1:33:18] would not cooperate with their Creed
[1:33:19] finally they led him away to Calvary and
[1:33:22] there that blood cell was broken of the
[1:33:24] precious Son of God the body of in which
[1:33:27] Jehovah dwell lived there came forth a
[1:33:30] Vine with its roots in glory with his
[1:33:33] branches on Earth to produce a Church of
[1:33:36] the Living God to show forth his
[1:33:39] resurrection and his power
[1:33:41] who is these men and women that would
[1:33:43] deny that church the vine of the Living
[1:33:46] God the never failing presence of the
[1:33:49] Lord Jesus with his church to live and
[1:33:51] to show forth his predestinated branches
[1:33:53] that he caught before the foundation of
[1:33:56] the Earth
[1:33:56] and swore by an oath that he had raised
[1:33:59] them up and his church today with the
[1:34:01] glory of his resurrection living in her
[1:34:03] I am the vine you are the branches
[1:34:06] every time the heart beats the the blood
[1:34:10] flotates
[1:34:11] every member of the body every time the
[1:34:14] loyal Heart Of God beats it pulsates
[1:34:16] through the name of Jesus Christ to the
[1:34:19] church whatsoever you ask in my name I
[1:34:23] will do I Am With You Always even to the
[1:34:26] end of the world no wonder Peter on the
[1:34:28] day of Pentacles says repent every one
[1:34:30] of you be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:34:31] Christ for the mission of sins and you
[1:34:33] shall be filled with the life from this
[1:34:35] Vine the Holy Spirit giving forth his
[1:34:38] name that if we're connected with him
[1:34:40] he's connected with God because he was
[1:34:42] the root and The Offspring of God he
[1:34:45] come to Earth the Earth was made by him
[1:34:47] he came into the world the world knew
[1:34:49] him not and now today after his dying to
[1:34:52] give forth the blood cell to break there
[1:34:54] that that through the blood of Jesus
[1:34:56] Christ a church could be Sanctified and
[1:34:59] put in order that the great Holy Spirit
[1:35:01] which is the life of the vine the
[1:35:04] eternal life of the vine the Holy Spirit
[1:35:05] could pulsate in to every member of the
[1:35:08] Church of the Living God it's no wonder
[1:35:11] they're odd and peculiar people no
[1:35:13] wonder they act strange they don't have
[1:35:15] no more affairs of this world for they
[1:35:17] are dead and buried in Christ they have
[1:35:19] raised a new life to be with the first
[1:35:21] fruits of them that enjoy the spiritual
[1:35:23] resurrection that the Holy Spirit Will
[1:35:26] flow through every member and would show
[1:35:28] forth the glory of God like God showed
[1:35:31] in Egypt when he brought forth that vine
[1:35:33] can you say Amen when I begin to think
[1:35:36] of this as I'm as I'm as I'm bringing
[1:35:38] things winding things up my thoughts up
[1:35:40] I want you to look at that Bond Lily
[1:35:42] here this morning now I I hope that that
[1:35:46] that this hasn't just been a lot of
[1:35:47] words what my desire has been here this
[1:35:49] morning is to show that the
[1:35:51] predestinated plan of God is is going on
[1:35:54] in this Mortal body in this mortal world
[1:36:00] the Eternal one came down as brother
[1:36:02] Branham says now we have got our roots
[1:36:04] in heaven and the vines are being
[1:36:07] expressed here on the earth we have got
[1:36:10] our headship from Heaven we've got our
[1:36:12] life from Heaven the supernatural power
[1:36:14] of the Holy Ghost is now living and
[1:36:16] energizing the seed of God on the inside
[1:36:18] of us how can we be anything else than
[1:36:21] what God has already ordained us to be
[1:36:24] but I believe that the Holy Spirit the
[1:36:27] holy spirit is not I I I I I I I think
[1:36:30] too many times that we have got so
[1:36:33] complacent now I just want to I want to
[1:36:35] just pour my heart out for just a moment
[1:36:36] amen here this morning because I want to
[1:36:39] tell you you'll never live this life by
[1:36:41] thinking that Holy Ghost amen is easy
[1:36:44] believism that believing this message
[1:36:47] amen is all that you've got to have in
[1:36:49] order uh uh to be a part of that drama
[1:36:52] you must be initiated into it by the
[1:36:57] Holy Ghost now now listen easy believism
[1:37:01] amen is something that the world has
[1:37:03] it's it's coming in making a confession
[1:37:06] shaking the preacher's hand amen getting
[1:37:09] baptized and then just sitting there in
[1:37:11] your in in your bench and and now you're
[1:37:13] you're a Christian that is not a
[1:37:15] Christian that's easy believism amen
[1:37:18] that that is that is part of the other
[1:37:20] that is part of of Cain worship amen
[1:37:23] Cain worship had no life in it Cain
[1:37:25] worship took the fruit amen the best
[1:37:28] fruit of the field and what he could
[1:37:30] produce and what he had he had grown and
[1:37:32] he offers that unto God and that is what
[1:37:34] the church has done today we have come
[1:37:37] in and we've made confessions and we
[1:37:38] have said things and amen we have made
[1:37:41] things flowery until the music is pretty
[1:37:43] and the preaching is pretty and amen and
[1:37:45] and and and and worship is pretty in and
[1:37:48] giving your heart to the Lord is pretty
[1:37:50] and everyone it's a dry eye coming into
[1:37:52] the church and it's a dry eye going back
[1:37:54] out of the church but I want to tell you
[1:37:56] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:37:58] when the Holy Spirit came down and
[1:38:00] baptized those people amen they were not
[1:38:02] the same scared men that were up there
[1:38:04] that 120 that was in that Upper Room
[1:38:06] when they came out of that upper room
[1:38:08] they were drunk man amen they were
[1:38:10] carried by a new wine there was a new
[1:38:12] something that had taken place and when
[1:38:14] they went out there on the streets they
[1:38:16] were not the same scared men amen that
[1:38:18] were in there hiding before now they're
[1:38:21] out there under the anointing of the
[1:38:23] Holy Spirit Peter's not the same tower
[1:38:25] that he was but now there is a vine that
[1:38:28] has been energized now he has anointed
[1:38:31] for service now there is a Church of the
[1:38:34] Living God it's no longer Jesus now it's
[1:38:38] God in his people living this drama
[1:38:43] ouch
[1:38:45] now this now this people would turn the
[1:38:47] world upside down now this people would
[1:38:49] heal the sick and raise the dead now
[1:38:51] this people would show that the Living
[1:38:53] God Of Heaven is living in his people
[1:38:56] here on Earth
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:39:02] man easy Believers and will never
[1:39:04] produce power friend
[1:39:07] is he believes and will never produce
[1:39:10] the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:14] it takes a dying
[1:39:16] and you say man
[1:39:18] easy believe is him
[1:39:20] will never bring up Lily Pond out of the
[1:39:23] scum and the muck of the bottom of the
[1:39:25] pond to overcome
[1:39:28] but it'll take the life the power of the
[1:39:31] life of the sun to beat down upon that
[1:39:35] scummy Pond that liturgized the seed
[1:39:39] that's way down in the bottom of that
[1:39:42] pond
[1:39:47] because
[1:39:49] there was some connection between
[1:39:51] the heavens
[1:39:53] and the Earth
[1:39:54] because there is some connection between
[1:39:57] the Sun
[1:39:58] and the seed
[1:40:01] it doesn't bring anything else up and
[1:40:03] that's coming upon everything else is
[1:40:04] dead the pond is dead everything's dead
[1:40:06] everything is coming it stinks but all
[1:40:09] of a sudden
[1:40:10] up through all of the scum and all the
[1:40:12] mud and all the rocks and all the filth
[1:40:13] and all the logs Here Comes something
[1:40:15] that's coming up and coming up and
[1:40:17] coming up working its way up in a pops
[1:40:19] its head up Hallelujah here comes the
[1:40:22] little Easter or the Little Lily upon
[1:40:24] Lily pokes his head up and begins to
[1:40:26] look around before you know what the
[1:40:27] Little Lily Pad amen begins to to expand
[1:40:30] and the beautiful flowers come off of it
[1:40:32] what was it it wasn't
[1:40:35] it was not somebody telling it or or
[1:40:39] it's shaking its hand it was it was an
[1:40:41] experience between the heavens and the
[1:40:45] Earth
[1:40:49] I wonder sometimes the easy beliefism
[1:40:53] that it's easy for us no wonder it's
[1:40:56] easy for us to do away
[1:40:58] but the nine spiritual gifts
[1:41:01] it's easy for us to do away and explain
[1:41:04] away
[1:41:07] because we ain't got enough Holy Ghost
[1:41:09] to perform it
[1:41:11] it's easy for
[1:41:15] um Church
[1:41:20] it doesn't mean that the seed's not
[1:41:22] there it means you'd better come out
[1:41:23] from underneath those denominational
[1:41:25] Towers
[1:41:27] that you're hiding behind it's the same
[1:41:29] Antichrist spirit that wants to do away
[1:41:32] with the life
[1:41:34] of the individual
[1:41:37] did the Catholic Church do at the
[1:41:38] beginning the Catholic Church says
[1:41:40] listen
[1:41:41] we don't need every man and woman with
[1:41:43] spiritual gifts
[1:41:44] we don't need men and women coming and
[1:41:47] doing their thing
[1:41:48] now the Apostle Paul
[1:41:50] says when you come together you've got
[1:41:52] Psalms one has a word of knowledge you
[1:41:54] have this you're edifying one another
[1:41:57] now he was getting on to the Corinthian
[1:41:59] Church this is not in order you need to
[1:42:01] do everything indecently in an order
[1:42:02] you're acting like children with these
[1:42:04] gifts
[1:42:05] amen but then when he got to the next
[1:42:07] chapter of the 14th chapter he said I I
[1:42:09] say covet the best gift I I say that
[1:42:12] y'all shall all covet to prophesy
[1:42:15] what we want to do away with that
[1:42:19] so did the Catholic Church
[1:42:22] the Catholic Church didn't want the
[1:42:23] gifts of the Spirit
[1:42:25] you know why the gifts of the Spirit is
[1:42:26] no longer present along for in the
[1:42:28] church and why Satan wants to keep those
[1:42:30] things away because brother Branham
[1:42:31] taught us that if the gifts are in the
[1:42:33] church sin will be exposed
[1:42:39] now I'm just talking to you from my
[1:42:41] heart here I'm just talking to you from
[1:42:42] my heart what I'm saying is it's easy
[1:42:45] for someone to set in a group
[1:42:56] and be disguised as Judas
[1:43:02] because the only thing that's going to
[1:43:03] tell the difference is the supernatural
[1:43:06] and the word of God
[1:43:09] and God will never do away his promise
[1:43:12] to the last in the last days I will pour
[1:43:15] out of my spirit upon All Flesh All
[1:43:19] Flesh that's Baptist flesh Mexican flesh
[1:43:21] Hebrew flesh that's black flesh yellow
[1:43:24] flesh Brown flesh red flesh yellow what
[1:43:27] whatever white flesh all these fleshes
[1:43:29] he's pouring them out every it's Paul
[1:43:31] it's falling on every denomination but
[1:43:33] only the seed that God has represented
[1:43:37] in the eternals is going to respond to
[1:43:40] that seed everyone else is going to have
[1:43:42] oh yeah you know yeah they're going to
[1:43:44] speak in tongues and oh yeah they're
[1:43:46] going to they're going to run the aisles
[1:43:47] oh yeah they're going to have their
[1:43:48] emotions and this is a trick of the
[1:43:52] devil to make us think we don't want
[1:43:55] anything to do with it
[1:44:00] they've missed it and they missed it and
[1:44:02] they missed it and they missed it and
[1:44:03] they missed it well I'm here to tell you
[1:44:05] the Holy Ghost don't miss it
[1:44:07] and I'm here to tell you God's place to
[1:44:09] every one of us here on this Earth
[1:44:11] for a purpose and with gifts and your
[1:44:14] name is already apart come on Church
[1:44:17] Holy Ghost energizing it with I'm going
[1:44:19] to tell you when the Holy Ghost
[1:44:20] energizes you those life of the word
[1:44:24] within you is going to come out in US
[1:44:27] come on Church come on now amen you
[1:44:30] don't get quiet on me hear what I'm
[1:44:32] saying is in the last days I will pour
[1:44:35] out my spirit and your sons and your
[1:44:38] daughters shall prophesy your young men
[1:44:41] shall see Visions the old men shall have
[1:44:45] dreams
[1:44:48] in the last days this is the last days
[1:44:57] praise the Lord
[1:44:59] what I'm saying
[1:45:02] the Catholic Church put it
[1:45:04] we're just going to have a few holy men
[1:45:07] let me take all your Bibles
[1:45:10] you don't need to study
[1:45:12] come on
[1:45:14] but they got by the time they got to the
[1:45:15] Dark Ages
[1:45:17] all the Bibles were collected it was all
[1:45:19] written in Latin
[1:45:20] and only the priests could have them
[1:45:23] we will teach you what you need to know
[1:45:26] there was no Holy Ghost worship there
[1:45:29] was no Holy Ghost this that well praise
[1:45:30] the Lord
[1:45:31] but I'm going to tell you we're living
[1:45:33] in the day where the gods opened the
[1:45:34] book up
[1:45:35] and he's saying amen whosoever will the
[1:45:39] command do the bride is go to the angel
[1:45:40] and take the open book
[1:45:42] come on
[1:45:43] that means that that that that that that
[1:45:45] means somebody else besides the preacher
[1:45:48] needs to be doing some study that means
[1:45:50] somebody else besides Mom and Daddy's
[1:45:52] got to do some studying I think
[1:45:53] something like what
[1:45:55] I've made somebody else has got to get a
[1:45:57] hold of God and say I want the holy
[1:45:58] ghost in my life that means God if you
[1:46:00] said that I'm part of this church I
[1:46:02] can't do it in my carnal ways I can't do
[1:46:05] it in my carnal thinking I've got to get
[1:46:07] a part of the Holy Ghost team I've got
[1:46:09] it's not been I'm part of a group the
[1:46:11] group Ain't Gonna Save Me the group
[1:46:12] ain't me I am an individual I have
[1:46:16] received the Holy Ghost I meet your
[1:46:18] presence I want your anointing I need
[1:46:22] you in my life living yourself through
[1:46:25] me
[1:46:28] I'm part of the drama
[1:46:30] you kids are part of the drama
[1:46:33] Hallelujah we're all part of the drama
[1:46:36] I praise the Lord
[1:46:38] Amen in my name you'll cast out devils
[1:46:40] and my name your hands on the sick my
[1:46:42] name you'll do these things in my name
[1:46:43] my name my name my name what what is it
[1:46:46] you are part of the Eternal book of God
[1:46:51] amen
[1:46:53] praise the Lord
[1:46:55] now
[1:46:57] when Jesus comes to the woman at the
[1:47:00] well
[1:47:03] because she had representation in the
[1:47:05] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:47:09] and she was part of God's thinking at
[1:47:10] the beginning
[1:47:12] Jesus on when he was here on Earth he
[1:47:15] said
[1:47:16] I needs must needs go
[1:47:21] that sounds like bad English
[1:47:24] but he said it and
[1:47:26] in another language so maybe our
[1:47:28] translations
[1:47:29] wrong but he said I must needs go
[1:47:34] to Samaria
[1:47:38] why what
[1:47:41] why
[1:47:43] because there is a
[1:47:44] red light worker
[1:47:48] there was a sex Queen
[1:47:51] that has her name
[1:47:56] on the book
[1:48:00] they came across fought Devil's coming
[1:48:02] and got all the way across got over
[1:48:03] there
[1:48:07] Jesus sent them disciples out to the
[1:48:09] going
[1:48:10] visit
[1:48:12] or go go get some groceries or whatever
[1:48:15] he starts talking to this woman
[1:48:19] eat a drink
[1:48:21] she says
[1:48:27] hi I'm a I'm a Samaritan you're a you're
[1:48:30] a Jew
[1:48:31] we don't have no dealings with each
[1:48:32] other what are you doing asking and
[1:48:35] has he began to talk to her and he says
[1:48:38] if you ask me have a drink I'll give you
[1:48:40] a drink and you'll never thirst again
[1:48:41] and she says
[1:48:43] you don't even have nothing to draw from
[1:48:45] this well and that well is deep
[1:48:47] what are you talking about
[1:48:49] he's thinking she's thinking he's
[1:48:51] hitting on her
[1:48:53] and then he says won't you go it's your
[1:48:55] husband and she says I don't have one he
[1:48:57] said you said the truth well
[1:49:01] he's had five and the one he's got it's
[1:49:03] not yours
[1:49:07] you turn around and look to him and said
[1:49:10] I perceived you're a prophet
[1:49:14] he said
[1:49:15] when the Messiah comes
[1:49:17] he will do these things
[1:49:24] he says I'm he
[1:49:29] says now
[1:49:30] you know
[1:49:33] you Samaritans you come to this well the
[1:49:36] Jews are saying you've got to be in
[1:49:37] Jerusalem you've got all of these things
[1:49:39] there but I'm saying that the times will
[1:49:41] come and now is that you must be
[1:49:43] worshiping in spirit and in truth
[1:49:46] she dropped a water panel and took off
[1:49:48] running
[1:49:50] telling the city come see a man that
[1:49:51] told me all that I I ever done
[1:49:55] there was something
[1:49:57] about that Supernatural presence of God
[1:50:01] that ignited the Eternal Gene's seed
[1:50:04] that was there
[1:50:07] as the musicians come
[1:50:09] I just want to read a little bit of what
[1:50:12] brother Branham said I thought it was I
[1:50:14] love the way he put it
[1:50:18] he said what if I'm speaking to a person
[1:50:19] that actually cannot receive it
[1:50:22] there's nothing in him to receive from
[1:50:25] the Bible said that she that lives in
[1:50:28] pleasure is dead while she's alive
[1:50:32] why was it those Pharisees look at Jesus
[1:50:35] all that we know we we he he was the
[1:50:37] Manifest word of God we believe that the
[1:50:40] Bible said it was
[1:50:42] well watch when he'd done his Messiah
[1:50:44] sign the Pharisees had a little bit of
[1:50:47] light they were good people lived a good
[1:50:49] Christian Life for a good religious life
[1:50:51] they had a little light about them they
[1:50:53] had organized in a priesthood they had a
[1:50:55] little light
[1:50:56] but down in the bottom of their heart
[1:50:58] they had no Eternal representation and
[1:51:00] Glory
[1:51:01] so when they seen the supernatural done
[1:51:03] they said this man's Beelzebub a devil
[1:51:06] what happened that put what like they
[1:51:09] had out
[1:51:10] but here was a little ill-famed woman a
[1:51:13] prostitute down in her heart well she
[1:51:16] had a representation of one of God's
[1:51:18] thoughts
[1:51:20] there she was waited in sin
[1:51:23] but when she seen what happened she said
[1:51:25] sir I believe you're a prophet I know
[1:51:26] when the Messiah comes he will tell us
[1:51:28] these things what did he do
[1:51:30] he cleansed her life
[1:51:32] he was a redeemer to her
[1:51:34] because he could lift her up
[1:51:38] where she came
[1:51:42] you'll miss that part if you're not if
[1:51:44] you're not careful
[1:51:46] she was part of
[1:51:49] Eternal representation and Glory
[1:51:52] in God's thinking
[1:51:54] Jesus came as the word The Living Word
[1:51:59] and brother Branham says he was her
[1:52:02] Redeemer
[1:52:04] because he could lift her up
[1:52:07] from this Mortal
[1:52:09] filthy world
[1:52:11] to where she came from in the mind of
[1:52:14] God
[1:52:15] but this Pharisee think of it religious
[1:52:18] as he could be and Jesus said you're of
[1:52:20] your father the devil and his works
[1:52:22] you'll do
[1:52:23] religious men belong to fine orders
[1:52:25] Jesus called them Snakes in the Grass
[1:52:27] and devils
[1:52:28] they rejected the light of the hour
[1:52:30] that's exactly what it was
[1:52:32] Jesus in his age what was he just like
[1:52:35] the prophets of their age each one of
[1:52:37] them was God's word being interpreted
[1:52:39] for that age Moses was God's word
[1:52:40] interpreted I'll send you down there
[1:52:42] I'll deliver them I'll send you down
[1:52:45] there with my word
[1:52:46] I'll do great signs and wonders he did
[1:52:48] it Mary she was God's words interpreted
[1:52:51] a virgin shall conceive that was God's
[1:52:53] word
[1:52:55] interpreted
[1:52:57] and I say today
[1:53:00] oh Church of the Living God
[1:53:04] God's calling us more
[1:53:07] and just coming to church three times a
[1:53:09] week
[1:53:10] calling us more
[1:53:12] just sitting in pew
[1:53:16] Pew destroy the Devil
[1:53:19] we are here
[1:53:24] Hallelujah
[1:53:26] someone says oh yeah don't take us back
[1:53:28] to Pentecost I I said I I say we need to
[1:53:30] go back to the original Pentecost not
[1:53:32] not 1906 Pentecost but the original
[1:53:34] where the Holy Ghost has his way in
[1:53:38] every one of our Lives can you say Amen
[1:53:42] hey man yes sir
[1:53:45] amen oh they they said well you there's
[1:53:48] nothing different
[1:53:50] someone told me the other day well
[1:53:51] there's nothing different between what
[1:53:52] what what what you're saying and and
[1:53:54] what they are in this Pentecost age
[1:53:55] brother Brandon says we don't need it
[1:53:56] and I said brother Brandon said we need
[1:53:58] the we need the Holy Ghost
[1:54:01] we need the gifts all the way up to the
[1:54:03] dime the day that he died
[1:54:05] he was expressing and declaring that we
[1:54:07] need the Living God but what he was
[1:54:09] trying to tell us is all this dancing
[1:54:11] and shouting and these all these tongues
[1:54:13] and all this stuff and then going out
[1:54:14] there living like the devil and and
[1:54:16] putting away of the word he says you're
[1:54:18] living contrary to it but a man or a
[1:54:21] woman that will come under the authority
[1:54:22] of the real Holy Ghost the real word of
[1:54:25] God subject themselves to it I want
[1:54:28] everyone in this building to know that
[1:54:30] you are subject to any of those nine
[1:54:32] spiritual gifts you are subject to
[1:54:34] visions and dreams you are subject to
[1:54:37] the power of an unlimited God
[1:54:39] but it's going to be somebody that is
[1:54:41] going to steal a way that is willing
[1:54:44] Amen to I'm not saying to manufacture

[2:07:35] there was a seed who needed it
[2:07:38] God was showing him his day aren't you
[2:07:40] glad that God knew you were going to
[2:07:42] need it and you were conquering for it
[2:07:44] and God sent it to you and then you had
[2:07:46] the ability to say hallelujah
[2:07:51] I'll never forget the days when God came
[2:07:53] to me
[2:07:55] I'll never forget the day hello
[2:07:58] surely there's more
[2:08:01] there's more and when it came and when I
[2:08:03] found out God's order and I seen the
[2:08:06] great drama that God put in Revelations
[2:08:08] 2 and 3 and seen it all folded out I
[2:08:11] thought
[2:08:12] part of the seventh one
[2:08:14] Hallelujah

[2:08:19] it's never been a problem for me to get
[2:08:21] in

[2:08:24] problem for me to say Lord
[2:08:26] cleanse me and wash me
[2:08:29] I'll take that open book I'll take it
[2:08:31] and eat it instead of me trying to

[2:10:25] little more time I don't know I was
[2:10:27] going to say we could dump that out and
[2:10:28] redo it but if it's if that's just the
[2:10:30] way it is

[2:15:13] brother J.R reek was preaching and he
[2:15:15] started going through different Miracles
[2:15:17] that have happened
[2:15:19] I started feeling something stir inside
[2:15:20] my heart
[2:15:22] I said uh
[2:15:25] and Stern and I said you're my God too
[2:15:33] and I claim this for myself brother
[2:15:36] Jeremy Schreiner the pastor was
[2:15:38] concluding the service and began singing
[2:15:40] one of the songs was I'm going to see a
[2:15:42] victory how I love that song
[2:15:45] I felt the presence of the law of God
[2:15:47] very near and as I was in the church
[2:15:49] service with them as if I was in the
[2:15:51] church service with him
[2:15:53] he stopped singing and said I have a
[2:15:55] sister on my heart for the last 15
[2:15:57] minutes
[2:15:58] she doesn't attend this church I don't
[2:16:00] even know if she's watching
[2:16:02] but I would like for us to pray for
[2:16:03] sister Stephanie callings I was sobbing
[2:16:05] at this point I started praising God
[2:16:09] for the victory in my life
[2:16:11] a little later my daughter Sarah came
[2:16:13] into my room and said Mama woke up this
[2:16:15] morning burdened for you
[2:16:17] I asked God to do something Supernatural
[2:16:19] for you today
[2:16:21] so that you will know that God is with
[2:16:23] you
[2:16:24] the devil has told me over and over God
[2:16:26] is not with you nor does he hear you
[2:16:28] well I'm here to tell you he's a liar
[2:16:31] Jesus said he would never leave me or
[2:16:34] forsake me
[2:16:35] since April 1
[2:16:37] I have taken down my blackout curtains I
[2:16:41] never lay in my dark closet
[2:16:43] I'm never and I'm starting to drive
[2:16:46] again
[2:16:47] I never go to bed wondering what life
[2:16:49] will be like tomorrow
[2:16:52] I make plans now I'm able to follow
[2:16:55] through with my plans day for the day
[2:16:58] from April 1st until now I typically
[2:17:01] would have been in bed at least 60 days
[2:17:03] and missed many church services
[2:17:06] not only have I been able to attend our
[2:17:08] services but I've been able to go to
[2:17:10] church meetings with my family
[2:17:12] I do not want to fail to give God all
[2:17:15] the glory that he deserves
[2:17:17] I can never praise him enough I'm seeing
[2:17:19] victories
[2:17:20] I pray this testimony will help others
[2:17:22] to believe God for their need he always
[2:17:25] keeps
[2:17:26] his word
[2:17:29] oh isn't that just wonderful
[2:17:35] [Applause]

[2:17:43] Stephanie I I've I've I've I've went

[2:17:58] the Holy Spirit I I just I just let the
[2:18:01] tape run
[2:18:02] and I sung songs while the presence of
[2:18:05] God was so strong

[2:18:09] and I spoke the word of the Lord and his
[2:18:11] sister Stephanie's life
[2:18:12] and and she said she'd listen to that
[2:18:14] until the tape broke wore out she would
